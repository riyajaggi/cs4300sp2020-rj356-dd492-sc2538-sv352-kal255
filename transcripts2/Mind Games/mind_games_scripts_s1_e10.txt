  MILES, ARE YOU READY?
  YES! ABSOLUTELY.
  FOR WHAT?
  WELL, MILES,
IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO EXPAND,
  WE'RE GONNA NEED YOU
TO START TAKING CASES.
  THAT MEANS YOU'RE
GONNA HAVE TO GET BETTER
  AT INTERFACING WITH THE CLIENTS.
 TODAY WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO LEAD THE MEETING.
  FINALLY!
  UH, BY WHICH I MEAN... THANK YOU.
  WE REALLY WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON CONNECTING WITH PEOPLE.
  I-I CONNECT. I USE THE FIVE-POINT NETWORK-EFFECT PRINCIPLE
 IN ALMOST EVERY INTERACTION WITH
A POTENTIALLY USEFUL SUBJECT --
  NO! [ RAPS ON DESK ]
  FIRST, STOP MAKING LISTS.
 AND SECOND -- AND I CAN'T
EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH --
 STOP REFERRING TO PEOPLE AS SUBJECTS.
  EMPATHIZE. YEAH.
  YOU WANT THE CLIENT TO FEEL LIKE YOU --
  YOU SEE THEM AS -- AS A PERSON WITH A PROBLEM
  AND NOT JUST AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A SCIENCE EXPERIMENT.
  TOTALLY GET IT. OKAY.
  EMPATHIZE, LISTEN ACTIVELY, BUILD RAPPORT,
 EXERT INFLUENCE, GUIDE BEHAVIOR.
STOP MAKING LISTS!
  Megan: HEY.
HEY.
 MAYBE I SHOULD COME.
 COME WHERE? TO THE CLIENT MEETINGS.
  DON'T WE PAY YOU TO ANSWER THE PHONE?
  YEAH, BUT I'VE BEEN READING THESE NEUROPSYCHOLOGY BOOKS,
  AND I REALLY -- WHY?
  BECAUSE THE MORE I UNDERSTAND EVERY ASPECT
  OF THIS BUSINESS, THE BETTER I CAN BE AT MY JOB.
  YOU MEAN THE ONE WHERE YOU ANSWER THE PHONE?
  [ SCOFFS ] YEAH.
  BUT ESPECIALLY THE ONE WHERE YOU ASK ME
  TO PLAY CHARACTERS AND MANIPULATE PEOPLE.
  REMEMBER THAT ONE?
  ALSO, I MAY HAVE UNDERESTIMATED
  HOW REPETITIVE ANSWERING THE PHONE CAN BE.
  MEGAN, CAN WE DEAL WITH THIS IN ANOTHER MEETING?
  BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, UNLEASHING MILES,
  WITH HIS 47 STEPS TO BEING A NORMAL HUMAN BEING,
  IS GONNA TAKE THE REST OF THIS ONE.
  [ TELEPHONE RINGING ]
  HEY, UH, MEGAN,
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM SAM?
  UH, YEAH. SHE TOLD ME TO APOLOGIZE.
  SHE'S NOT MAKING IT IN THIS MORNING.
  AGAIN? HAVE HER CALL ME.
  I TOLD HER. HAVE YOU TRIED CALLING HER?
  YEAH.
EVERY TIME I DO, IT'S --
  GOOD MORNING. EDWARDS AND ASSOCIATES.
  HOW MAY WE BE OF SERVICE?
  MY HUSBAND.
 20 YEARS AGO IN HIS CHAMPIONSHIP BOUT AGAINST LANCE LACY.
  HE'S THE ONE STANDING, RIGHT?
  IN THAPHOTO.
  LATELY, DAVID'S FIGHTS END THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
  HE HASN'T WON IN FIVE YEARS.
  HERE'S DAVID TODAY.
  I THOUGHT I HAD FINALLY CONVINCED HIM TO HANG IT UP,
  BUT HE'S BEEN OFFERED SOME BIG LAST FIGHT
  AGAINST SOME UP-AND-COMING MANIAC NAMED CHAINSAW.
  THEY ONLY WANT DAVID BECAUSE THEY KNOW
  THEY CAN STILL DRAW A CROWD TO WATCH HIM GET KNOCKED OUT.
  Megan: SORRY I'M LATE.
  YOU MUST BE JACKIE.
  I GOT STUCK ON THE PHONE. WE TALKED ABOUT YOUR CASE.
  I'M MEGAN. GO AHEAD.
  UM...
 SO, Y-YOU WANT US TO CONVINCE
YOUR HUSBAND NOT TO FIGHT.
  HE IS A SHADOW OF THE ATHLETE HE ONCE WAS, DR. EDWARDS.
  WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY. WE HAVE THREE BEAUTIFUL KIDS.
  THERE'S NOTHING TO GAIN AND EVERYTHING TO LOSE.
  AGGRESSION-INSTINCT THEORY POSITS
 THAT, WELL, CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS
ARE SIMPLY HARDWIRED FOR COMBAT,
  BUT, UH, THERE IS A SWEDISH STUDY ON CHEMICAL CASTRATION
  THAT SHOWED THAT AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR COULD BE DRASTICALLY DECREASED --
  Ross: NOT THAT CASTRATION
 WOULD BE THE FIRST STRATEGY
WE'D INVESTIGATE.
  OH, NO. NO, NO.
  I-I'M SIMPLY SAYING THAT, UH, GENETICALLY SPEAKING --
  SHE DOESN'T WANT TO NEUTER HER HUSBAND.
  SHE SIMPLY WANTS HIM TO ENJOY THE LIFE AND FAMILY
  THAT HE'S WORKED SO HARD FOR.
  YES. THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.
  YOU SAID THE FIGHT IS ON FRIDAY.
 YES.
  DOES HE KNOW HOW YOU FEEL?
  I BEGGED HIM TO NOT GO BACK IN THERE,
 BUT IT'S LIKE HE -- IT'S LIKE
HE DOESN'T EVEN HEAR ME.
 I WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE, BUT I LOVE HIM,
 AND THIS CHAINSAW GUY,
  THE LAST OPPONENT,
HE PUT IN THE HOSPITAL.
 IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO
DAVID, IF I WERE TO LOSE HIM --
  WE UNDERSTAND. WE DO.
  WE'RE GONNA DEVISE A STRATEGY
  TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.
  THANK YOU.
  [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ]
  Miles: MEGAN...I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL HAVE A TALK.
  DO YOU GUYS WANT TO GO FIRST, OR SHOULD I --
  MEGAN. [ SIGHS ]
  THAT WAS... [ SIGHS ]
  ...REALLY AMAZING.
  JUST BARGING INTO A MEETING
  THAT YOU SPECIFICALLY ASKED HER NOT TO?
  USURPING MY AUTHORITY AT A CRITICAL MOMENT IN THE DISCUSSION?
  YEAH, LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE LET YOU CONTINUE
  WITH YOUR THOUGHT ON CASTRATING THE WOMAN'S HUSBAND.
  THE TRUTH IS, MILES,
IT WOULDN'T BE A BAD IDEA
  TO LISTEN IN ON MEGAN'S CALLS,
  FIND OUT HOW SHE'S
FORGING BONDS WITH PEOPLE
  BEFORE THEY EVEN
WALK THROUGH THE DOOR.
  OKAY, OKAY. I GET WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE, ALL RIGHT?
  YOU'RE BOTH BLINDED TO HER TRANSGRESSIONS
  BASED ON THE FACT THAT SHE'S INCREDIBLY ATTRACTIVE.
  AWW. THANK YOU.
  I'M NOT COMPLIMENTING YOU, ALL RIGHT?
  YOU'RE ABUSING YOUR BIOLOGICAL GIFTS
  TO ESSENTIALLY WALK ALL OVER --
  HEY, I'M NOT USING
MY BIOLOGICAL ANYTHING.
 I HAVE BEEN THINKING OF A
STRATEGY FOR THIS CASE, AND --
  OH, YOU HAVE A STRATEGY NOW. OH, WELL, THAT'S LOVELY.
  IF ANYONE NEEDS ME, I'LL BE ANSWERING THE PHONES.
  ALL RIGHT, CUT IT OUT! WHAT --
  MEGAN, WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY?
  YEAH.
  OH. YOU MEAN NOW?
  YES.
 WELL, I'VE BEEN READING
 ABOUT BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS
INVOLVING PIGEONS, AND...
  Clark: AND?
  AND...
  ...I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE WOULD USE THEM YET,
  BUT I...
  SHOULD PROBABLY
READ THE CHAPTER AGAIN.
  IT'S A BAD IDEA.
  NO, NO. IT'S NOT AS BAD AS CUTTING THE GUY'S --
 I-I THINK SOME SORT OF
MORTALITY-AVERSION --
  NO, NO, NO, OKAY?
  NO BIRDS.
NO MORTALITY AVERSION, OKAY?
  WE ARE DOING A STANDARD
  STRESS-BASED
CONFIDENCE EROSION LOOP.
  IT'S PERFECT.
I THOUGHT OF IT IN THE MEETING.
 AND I WAS GOING TO EXPLAIN IT
WITH TREMENDOUS EMPATHY
 WHEN SOMEONE CUT ME OFF MID-SENTENCE.
  Clark: YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD IDEA.
  OH, THANK YOU!
  DO YOU HAVE A VERSION OF THIS PROGRAM?
  ON MY LAPTOP,
AND I COULD EASILY TWEAK IT
  TO MAKE THE IMAGES
APPLICABLE TO AN ATHLETE.
  ALL RIGHT. EXCELLENT.
  UM, EXPLAIN THIS TO MEGAN, OKAY?
  UH, MEGAN, YOU'RE GONNA NEED
  TO BE ABLE TO RELAY THIS TO JACKIE
  WHEN YOU CALL HER BACK, OKAY? OKAY.
  WHAT?
  LOOK, MEGAN PUTS JACKIE AT EASE
  AND HAS CLEARLY ESTABLISHED
HERSELF AS THE POINT OF CONTACT.
  THERE'S NO REASON TO CHANGE THAT.
  SO, JUST CALL US WHEN YOU'RE READY. WH...
  OKAY, I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU DECIDED --
  I DID NOT MEAN TO OVERSTEP.
  I AM WAY OUT OF MY DEPTH HERE,
  SO ANYTHING THAT YOU COULD TEACH ME WOULD BE GREAT.
  ALSO, THAT VEST WITH THOSE SHOES...
  [ CLICKS TONGUE ]
 OH, WELL...THANK YOU. IT'S ACTUALLY --
  WAIT A MINUTE.
  PERSPECTIVE SHIFT. ADVICE SEEKING.
  UNSOLICITED
COMPLIMENTARY BEHAVIOR.
 YOU WERE JUST READING
ABOUT THIS, WEREN'T YOU?
 OKAY, YOU CAN COME, BUT NO MORE
USING YOUR BOOK ON ME.
  THAT'S FAIR.
 YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A REALLY
GREAT INSTINCT FOR THESE THINGS.
  Miles: OH, STOP IT!
  KEEP MOVING. KEEP MOVING.
  THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. NICE COMBO.
  OKAY. DAVID, YOU READY?
  [ SIGHS ]
  YOU REALLY THINK THIS IS GONNA HELP?
  I DO.
  YOU EVER BEEN IN A FIGHT?
  UH, WELL, IN FIFTH GRADE,
  CANDY VANDERPOOL GAVE ME A BLACK EYE,
  ALTHOUGH I DID HEAR
  THAT LATER ON SHE BECAME MARK PATTERSON.
  BY THEN IT WAS WAY TOO LATE TO RETALIATE.
  MILES IS A LEADING RESEARCHER
  IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PRIMING.
  YOU SAID IT YOURSELF --
  THE GUY WHO WINS UP HERE, WINS OUT THERE.
  ALL RIGHT.
 [ CLEARS THROAT ] ALL RIGHT, WHAT ARE WE DOING?
  HEY. HEY. HELLO.
  WE STARTED TO THINK YOU'D FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT US.
 YEAH, I JUST...I HAD SOME THINGS
WITH MY PLACE, SO I, UH --
  OKAY, CAN WE FOCUS, PLEASE?
  WHAT... ARE WE FOCUSING ON?
 OKAY.
  WHILE DAVID WORKS
THESE MENTAL-AGILITY PUZZLES,
  THESE IMAGES WILL BE SHOWN TO HIM
 IN FLICKER FRAME THAT HE WON'T
CONSCIOUSLY BE ABLE TO DETECT,
  BUT HIS SUBCONSCIOUS WILL ABSORB THEM.
 AND WITHIN A COUPLE MINUTES,
IT'LL ERODE HIS CONFIDENCE.
 HE WON'T BE ABLE TO DO THE PUZZLES ANYMORE.
  PROGRAM SHUTS DOWN.
  AT THIS POINT, HE THINKS
 THAT HE'S BEEN PRIMED TO BE AT HIS BEST...
  BUT THE TRUTH --
VIRTUALLY INCAPACITATED.
  AS A RESULT,
 DAVID WILL PERFORM HORRIBLY
WITH HIS SPARRING PARTNER
  AND REALIZE THAT
 IF HE CAN'T EVEN FINISH
A SIMPLE PRACTICE ROUND...
  HE WON'T HAVE A PRAYER
AGAINST SOMEBODY NAMED CHAINSAW.
  WAIT, THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT.
  Ross: WHAT? Sam: WHAT?
  NO, HIS ABILITY IS ERODING...
  BUT VERY SLOWLY.
  I MEAN, MOST PEOPLE
  CAN'T DO THIS PROGRAM FOR MORE THAN TWO MINUTES.
  WELL, HOW'S HE DOING?
  UH, AT THIS RATE?
 IT'LL BE 20 MINUTES
BEFORE HE GIVES OUT.
  ARE WE ACTUALLY GONNA BOX AT SOME POINT,
  OR IS IT JUST GONNA BE VIDEO GAMES UP UNTIL FIGHT NIGHT?
  OKAY, THAT --
  THAT'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF RECORD, ALL RIGHT?
  I'VE HEARD OF PEOPLE MAYBE GETTING TO THE TEENS, BUT --
  OKAY, L-LOOK,
IF WE LET HIM BOX NOW -- PERPETUAL REGRESSION!
 WE NEED TO TELL HIM. I THINK SO, TOO. I DO THINK SO.
 COMPLETELY REVERSED --
  I-IT'S A DIFFICULT PROPOSITION --
  I REALLY HATE IT WHEN YOU GUYS DO THIS.
  [ BELL DINGS ]
 WAIT. WAIT, WAIT!
  WAIT! NO, NO, NO!
  WAIT! JUST DON'T PUNCH ME, OKAY?!
  I-I-I'M SORRY. I-I CAN'T DO THIS.
  WE CAN'T DO -- WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS.
  David: DO WHAT?
  UM...WELL, I-I'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT.
  I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
NOW YOU WANT TO HELP HIM WIN? YES.
  WITH SCIENCE? YES.
  AGAINST A MAN NAMED CHAINSAW?
  I'M ALMOST POSITIVE THAT THAT'S NOT HIS REAL NAME.
  NO, THEY STARTED CALLING HIM THAT
  BECAUSE HE CHOPS PEOPLE DOWN,
  AND I HIRED YOU TO STOP MY HUSBAND
  FROM BECOMING ONE OF THEM.
  LOOK, DAVID SURVIVED OVER 24 MINUTES
  OF A CONFIDENCE-EROSION LOOP.
 OH, GREAT -- THEN HE CAN FIGHT
YOUR COMPUTER ON FRIDAY,
  NOT SOME GUY NAMED CHAINSAW.
  LOOK, YOU WANT HIM BACK, RIGHT?
  YOU WANT A HAPPY, ENGAGED, LOVING HUSBAND AND FATHER?
  YES.
  SOMEBODY WHO SURVIVES 24 MINUTES
  OF A CONFIDENCE-EROSION TEST DOESN'T GIVE UP CLEANLY.
  IF WE SHATTER HIS CONFIDENCE
  AND HE ENDS UP NOT DOING THIS FIGHT,
  YOU'RE JUST GONNA END UP WITH A BROKEN BOXER,
  A MAN WHO'S GONNA SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE WONDERING,
  "WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
  IF I STEPPED IN THAT RING THAT LAST TIME?"
  IT'S CALLED PERPETUAL REGRESSION.
  A GUY LIKE THAT ISN'T HAPPY IF HE QUITS.
  HE NEEDS TO FINISH, AND WE CAN HELP HIM.
  [ SIGHS ]
 HAVE YOU EVER SEEN MY HUSBAND FIGHT, DR. EDWARDS?
  NO.
  HE WAS FINISHED A LONG TIME AGO.
  HEY. WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
  UH...
  COMPUTER GUY OUT THERE SAID NOW YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME WIN.
  SO, WHAT? BEFORE, YOU WERE...
  TRYING TO GET YOU TO QUIT.
  BUT YOUR NUMBERS INDICATE
  THAT THAT WOULD HAVE LEFT YOU PERPETUALLY DISSATISFIED.
  YOU...YOU HIRED PEOPLE TO SABOTAGE ME?
  I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.
 I DON'T WANT TO WATCH YOU GET HURT ANYMORE.
  OH, NO?
  WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK THIS FEELS?
  YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS LIKE, DAVID,
  TO HAVE TO WATCH SOMEONE YOU LOVE GET BEATEN UNCONSCIOUS,
  TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY YOU LOST THE FIGHT
  BECAUSE YOU DON'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING PAST THE INTRODUCTIONS.
  LOOK, I CAN TAKE THIS KID. HE'S --
  NO. NO, YOU CAN'T.
  NOT ANYMORE.
  YOU DON'T NEED TO, SO JUST...
  PLEASE COME HOME.
  YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ME.
  I LOVE YOU.
  IT'S NOT THE SAME.
  [ DOOR CLOSES ]
  WHAT ABOUT YOU, HUH? YOU THINK I CAN WIN?
  LOOK [SIGHS] AND I SAY THIS
 AS SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS VIRTUALLY
NOTHING ABOUT BOXING...
 YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
THE BEST BOXER IN THE RING.
 YOU'RE OLDER, SLOWER,
AND ALMOST CERTAINLY WEAKER
  THAN YOUR OPPONENT.
  SO IF YOU TRY TO BE THE BEST BOXER,
  NO, I DON'T THINK YOU CAN WIN.
  ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE WITH HER. I SHOULD -- I SHOULD QUIT.
 NO. I THINK YOU SHOULD QUIT
TRYING TO BE THE BEST BOXER.
  WH-- AND WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE ME?
 IF YOU LISTEN TO US... THE WINNER.
  JACKIE SEEMS REALLY UPSET, GUYS,
  AND DAVID DOESN'T SEEM THAT GREAT, EITHER.
  LOOK, I UNDERSTAND IT'S HARD FOR HER TO SEE,
  BUT THIS IS THE PROPER ROUTE TO WHAT SHE WANTS.
  I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE A PLAN?
  YES. FOR STARTERS, WE NEED A SHOCK COLLAR.
  LIKE, UH, FOR A DOG? YEAH, A VERY LARGE DOG.
  [ STAMMERS ] DAVID'S NECK IS GIANT.
  UM, WE ALSO NEED
  SOMEBODY WHO CAN DYE FABRIC TO A VERY SPECIFIC COLOR,
  UM, SOMEBODY WHO CAN SEW, MUSICAL EQUIPMENT --
  NOT INSTRUMENTS -- UH, ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS
  LIKE THE -- THE ONE YOU USE
  TO MAKE THOSE LITTLE SONGS, LATRELL.
 YOU MAKE
LITTLE SONGS?
  I TOLD YOU THAT IN CONFIDENCE, CLARK.
 AND A TATTOO ARTIST! TATTOO ARTIST?
  YEAH, RIGHT, THAT'S CRAZY. UM, HENNA ARTIST.
  NO, WAIT, BODY-PAINT ARTIST. NO, FORGET THAT!
  JUST -- J-JUST GET BODY PAINT, AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
 BODY PAINT, SHOCK COLLARS,
AND LATRELL DEEJAYING --
 THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE WORST
FRATERNITY PARTY EVER.
  WHERE ARE WE GOING?
  'CAUSE WE WALKED
PAST THE CARS LIKE A BLOCK AGO.
  WELL, THAT'S STUPID. WE'RE IN A HURRY!
 HEY, SAM. YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON?
  OH, NOTHING.
  UM, JUST SOME STUFF WITH MY PLACE -- BILLS, RED TAPE.
  LOOK, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS --
  NO, NO, NO. GOD, THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL.
  I TOTALLY WANT TO DO... THIS.
  UM, IT'S JUST THINGS HAVE BEEN CRAZY.
  I'LL GET IT TOGETHER. I PROMISE.
  Clark: GUYS! W-WE SHOULD GO.
  DON'T WANT TO UPSET THE GUY WITH THE SHOCK COLLARS.
  [ CHUCKLES ]
  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN'T JUST GET THIS OVER WITH.
  WE'RE GOING AS FAST AS WE CAN, SAM.
  WE PULL THE STRING
ON THIS THING TOO QUICKLY,
 WE'VE GOT NOTHING AND
WE'RE BOTH ANSWERING TO VINCENT.
  YOU WANT THAT? WHAT IS WITH YOU?
 I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
LIKE THIS ON A JOB BEFORE.
  BECAUSE I'VE NEVER BEEN SCREWING
  PEOPLE THAT I GENUINELY LIKED BEFORE.
  LOOK, YOU'RE THE ONE
 WHO WANTS TO STAY HERE
WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER.
 THE STRANGER YOU ACT NOW,
THE MORE YOU AVOID THEM,
 THE MORE SUSPICIOUS YOU'RE GONNA
LOOK WHEN THIS ALL COMES DOWN.
  ROSS CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH ME. I KNOW IT.
  AND MILES, I MEAN...I CAN'T EVEN LOOK HIM IN THE EYE.
  THEN DON'T STAY. AVOID THEM ALL YOU WANT.
  WE'LL TAKE THE MONEY AND HIT THE ROAD.
  YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT.
  THEN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO STOP AVOIDING THESE PEOPLE,
  BECAUSE IF THEY FIGURE YOU OUT...
  YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A CHOICE.
 Miles: I KNOW I SHOULDN'T
BE THREATENED. I KNOW.
  AND IT'S JUST... [ SIGHS ]
  FOR THE MOST PART,
 EVERY STRATEGY THAT I HAVE
PROPOSED HAS KIND OF TANKED,
 AND MEGAN'S GRADUATED FROM
BEING A HUMAN ANSWERING MACHINE
 TO HEADING UP HER OWN CASES IN LIKE A WEEK.
  WOW, I'M TALKING
ABOUT THIS WAY TOO MUCH,
  BUT IT'S KIND OF YOUR FAULT.
  YOU'RE REAL EASY TO TALK TO, OLIVER.
  DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY...
  OH, MY GOD,
YOU'RE BREAKING UP WITH ME.
  NO.
  I WAS JUST GONNA SAY THAT YOU'RE OVER-THINKING IT.
  MEGAN IS NOT THROWING YOU OFF.
  YOU'RE DOING IT TO YOURSELF.
  YOU'RE A GENIUS, MILES.
  TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS. YOU'LL BE FINE.
 HOW DID SAM JUST DROP YOU ON MY LAP LIKE THIS?
 SHE'S, LIKE, SOME SORT
OF MATCHMAKING SAVANT.
  HMM.
 ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
WANT TO COME SEE BOXING
  AT A NATIVE AMERICAN HOTEL AND CASINO
 SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE OF INDIANA?
  OOH, AS AWESOME AS EACH PART OF THAT SOUNDS,
  [Chuckling] I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO WORK.
  HAS ANYBODY EVER ASKED YOU
  WHY YOU BOTHER WITH A JOB THAT TAKES YOU TO INDIANA?
  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
  I MEAN YOUR PARENTS ARE, LIKE,
  ZILLIONAIRES OR SOMETHING, RIGHT?
  YOU COULD SPEND YOUR LIFE TAKING THE FAMILY JET
  TO CHARITY AUCTIONS AND TENDING TO A PET TIGER.
 YOU HAVE A VERY ACCURATE PICTURE
OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE WEALTHY.
  I'M SORRY. IS THAT WEIRD
  IF I ASK YOU QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW YOU GREW UP?
  NO. IT'S NOT WEIRD.
IT'S LIKELY TO BE VERY BORING.
  BUT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT WEIRD.
  IT'S WEIRD. [ CHUCKLES ] FORGET IT.
  NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. COME ON. COME ON.
  WHAT -- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
  I...
  SUDDENLY FORGOT.
  [ SLOT MACHINES RINGING ]
  MEGAN! HEY.
  HEY, DAVID.
  HEY, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
  YEAH. YOU SEEM TO GET ON WITH MY WIFE OKAY,
  AND I'VE BEEN CALLING HER.
  WELL, SHE'S... NOT CALLING ME BACK, SO...
  I WAS JUST WONDERING, DID SHE --
  SHE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT, UH...
  ABOUT COMING TO THE FIGHT?
  NO.
 BUT I-I CAN REACH OUT TO HER IF YOU WANT.
  IT'S OKAY.
  I-I WAS JUST -- JUST WONDERING.
  YEAH.
  ALL RIGHT, I SHOULD GO.
  YOU KNOW, I GOT THE...
  YEAH. SEE YA.
  GOOD LUCK.
  OKAY. MUSIC.
  WELL, I DON'T KNOW IF I'D CALL IT THAT.
  THE TRACK YOU GAVE ME SOUNDED LIKE WIND.
  Latrell: â™ª MY CHERIE AMOUR â™ª
  â™ª LOVELY AS A SUMM-- â™ª Ross: HEY, THAT'S YOU!
  WRONG TRACK. OH, COME ON!
  I GOT TO HEAR THE REST OF THAT.
  [ RHYTHMIC BEATING PLAYS ]
  OKAY, THAT'S NOT THE SOUND OF THE WIND.
  IT'S THE WOMB.
  ADD A SLIGHT HINT OF PAN FLUTE.
  GIVE IT TO THE STAGE MANAGER FOR OUR ENTRANCE MUSIC.
  WHOA, WHOA. THAT'S GONNA BE OUR ENTRANCE MUSIC?
 YEAH, THE SOUND OF THE WOMB
HAS A PRIMAL CALMING EFFECT.
 IT LOWERS HEART RATE, COUNTERS AGGRESSION.
 WE PLAY IT AS WE ENTER
 AND BASICALLY SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF CHAINSAW.
  ISN'T THAT GONNA HAVE THE SAME EFFECT ON OUR GUY?
 NO. HE'LL BE WEARING HEADPHONES, LISTENING TO...THIS.
  â™ª PRETTY LITTLE ONE THAT I -- â™ª
 Latrell: I HAVEN'T MADE
THAT TRACK YET.
  OOH, THE HIGH NOTE. OH, WELL. WHATEVER.
  IT'LL BE GREAT. NEXT?
  OKAY, THIS IS THE EXACT COLOR THAT YOU SPECIFIED,
 BUT IF WE WANT THEM TO STAY THAT WAY, WE SHOULDN'T WASH THEM.
  YEAH. THOSE LOOK GREAT. [ CHUCKLES ]
  THE COLOR IS BAKER-MILLER PINK,
  SOMETIMES CALLED "DRUNK-TANK PINK."
  STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT ACTUALLY HAS
  A TRANQUILIZING EFFECT -- SAPPING ENERGY, SLOWING PULSE.
  AGAIN, CHAINSAW SEES THIS --
  TAKES THE GAS RIGHT OUT OF HIS TANK.
  MILES?
  WORKED ALL NIGHT ON THIS.
  "ONE PLUS TWO EQUALS FOUR." I DON'T GET IT.
  EXACTLY. WE'RE GONNA PAINT THAT ON DAVID'S CHEST
  SO A SMALL PORTION OF CHAINSAW'S SUBCONSCIOUS
  WILL CONTINUALLY BE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF IT.
  YOU'RE ASSUMING THAT SOMEONE
NAMED CHAINSAW KNOWS HOW TO ADD.
  I'M AFRAID TO ASK
ABOUT THE SHOCK COLLAR.
  RIGHT.
  DAVID'S A FIGHTER. HE WANTS TO PUNCH.
  WE NEED TO BREAK THAT HABIT SO THAT HE'S JUST DODGING
  AND DEFENDING UNTIL CHAINSAW'S TIRED,
  BUT IT'S NOT EASY TO BREAK A 20-YEAR HABIT.
  SO AS HE TRAINS,
  EVERY TIME DAVID THROWS A PUNCH INSTEAD OF DEFENDING HIMSELF,
  MORT ISSUES A CORRECTIVE STIMULUS.
  Ross: SO, THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA WIN THE FIGHT?
  PINK SHORTS, BAD MATH, AND THE WOMB'S GREATEST HITS?
 CAN I SAY SOMETHING? YES. GO.
 I JUST TALKED TO DAVID,
AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT JACKIE.
  APPARENTLY,
HE'S BEEN CALLING HER
  AND SHE'S NOT CALLING HIM BACK.
  THAT MUST BE SO FRUSTRATING.
 I DON'T KNOW. IT SEEMS LIKE
SHE'S ON HIS MIND A LOT.
  I WONDER
IF WE SHOULDN'T BE TRYING
  TO GET HER
TO COME TO THE FIGHT.
  THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.
  YEAH, LOOK, JACKIE TOLD DAVID THAT,
  IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS,
  SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT HE CAN WIN THE FIGHT.
  HE WON'T BE ABLE TO LOOK AT HER
  WITHOUT THINKING OF THIS LACK OF FAITH.
 CLARK, THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR 15 YEARS.
  I MEAN, I JUST CAN'T SEE --
  MEGAN, YOU DON'T COUNTER CONFIDENCE DRAG
  BY EXPOSING THE SUBJECT TO THE SOURCE OF IT.
  Miles: YOU OFFSET IT BY INCREASING HIS CONFIDENCE
  IN A WAY THAT COMPENSATES FOR THE DRAG.
  EXACTLY.
  AND...HOW DO WE DO THAT?
UM, I HAVE NO IDEA.
 BUT THE TUB IN THERE
HAS JETS,
  AND I THINK A LOT BETTER SURROUNDED BY MOVING HOT WATER.
  I THINK WE'LL LET YOU DO THAT PART ALONE.
  NO, ACTUALLY, STUDIES SHOW...
  [ LAUGHS ] I'M KIDDING.
  [ SIGHS ]
  [ SOFT MUSIC PLAYS ]
  [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]
  WHITE RUSSIAN.
  I DIDN'T ORDER A WHITE RUSSIAN.
  FROM THE LADY.
  THANK YOU.
  [ CLEARS THROAT ]
 IS THIS AN INVITATION TO JOIN YOU?
  [ Russian accent ] KATERINA PETROVKA.
  OKAY, WHAT ARE WE DOING?
  I AM VISITING. ARE YOU VISITING?
  SAM -- KATERINA, PLEASE.
  WHAT IS THIS,
ONE OF YOUR CON PERSONAS?
  NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
  SAM IS JUST WEAK, AFRAID OF THINGS THAT MOVE QUICKLY.
  I HAVE NO SUCH FEAR,
  AND I APOLOGIZE ON HER BEHALF, MISTER...
 [ Midwestern accent ] BOB PHILLIPS.
  TRACTOR SALES, MIDWEST REGION.
  I'M, UH, IN TOWN FOR A CONVENTION.
  NEED A TRACTOR? I AM YOUR MAN.
  IT IS A PLEASURE TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE.
  WHERE ARE YOU FROM, KATERINA?
  MOSCOW. MOSCOW.
  I'M FROM TERRA HAUTE, INDIANA.
  I WOULD LIKE TO VISIT SOMEDAY,
  IF ONLY SO WE MEET AGAIN, MR. BOB PHILLIPS.
  [ Normal voice ]
AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE THAT,
 SAM AND I HAVE BEEN EXPLORING
SOMETHING VERY INTERESTING.
  WELL, TONIGHT, SHE WOULD LIKE YOU TO BE WITH ME --
  KATERINA PETROVKA.
  SAM WANTS ME
TO BE WITH ANOTHER WOMAN?
  THAT DOESN'T REALLY SOUND LIKE HER.
  I RECEIVED A CABLE COMMUNICATING HER WISHES.
  A CABLE? YES. WE COMMUNICATE VIA CABLE.
  THAT ADDS UP.
THIS CABLE SAY ANYTHING ELSE?
  THE REST IS TOP SECRET.
  I AM ONLY ALLOWED TO REVEAL IT
  WHEN WE ARE SAFELY IN YOUR HOTEL ROOM.
  THAT SOUNDS PRETTY IMPORTANT.
 WE SHOULD PROBABLY HEAD UP THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
  YOU ARE VERY PERCEPTIVE TRACTOR SALESMAN.
  I HEAR THAT A LOT.
  Clark: I THINK I GOT IT!
  OOH!
  THE HELL'S GOING ON OUT HERE?!
  WRONG DOOR! SORRY, WRONG DOOR.
  GO BACK TO BED. CATCH A CASE.
  HEY, I THINK I GOT IT! CLARK --
  OH, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T... I DIDN'T MEAN...
  OH, IT'S JUST KATERINA PETROVKA.
  DO SVIDANIYA. HI.
  LOOK, I DON'T HAVE TIME TO HEAR ABOUT WHATEVER THIS IS.
  LOOK, WE NEED MILES, A COMPUTER,
  AND YOU NEED TO GET US SOME AD TIME
  BETWEEN THE FIFTH AND SIXTH ROUND, OKAY?
  CAN'T YOU JUST CALL MILES INSTEAD?!
  SORRY. WRONG DOOR. MILES?! MILES?!
  [ KNOCK ON DOOR ]
  SORRY. WRONG DOOR.
  OKAY, MORT SAYS
  IF YOU DODGE AND DEFEND UNTIL THE SIXTH ROUND,
 CHAINSAW SHOULD BE TIRED ENOUGH
AND, IF YOU'VE CONSERVED,
 YOU SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY
FOR ONE MASSIVE STRIKE.
  HE'S ENJOYED SHOCKING THAT STRATEGY INTO ME.
  I WAS WORRIED THAT
WE MIGHT NEED SOMETHING MORE.
  IS THIS GONNA HURT? NO, NO, NO.
  JUST BEFORE THE SIXTH ROUND,
  WE'RE GONNA TAKE OVER THE ARENA'S SOUND AND VIDEO SYSTEM.
  WHY?
 TO PLAY AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL
SUBLIMINAL DISPLAY --
  HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, MILITARY-GRADE.
 OUR TESTING INDICATES
 THAT THIS SHOULD SCRAMBLE CHAINSAW'S BRAIN
  AND RENDER HIM
COMPLETELY VULNERABLE
  WHEN YOU MOUNT
YOUR SIXTH-ROUND ATTACK.
  STUFF LIKE THAT REALLY WORKS?
  ABSOLUTELY.
  EXCEPT THE VIDEO
WE'RE GONNA BE RUNNING
  ISN'T ACTUALLY
A SUBLIMINAL ANYTHING.
 IT WON'T HAVE ANY EFFECT
ON HIS OPPONENT AT ALL.
  SO WHAT'S THE POINT?
  GETTING DAVID TO THINK THAT
WE'VE INCAPACITATED HIS OPPONENT
  IS GOING TO INCREASE HIS CONFIDENCE
  IN A WAY THAT SHOULD OFFSET
  ANY CONFIDENCE DRAG THAT'S LEFT OVER FROM JACKIE.
  COUNTLESS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN US
 THAT PLACEBOS ACTUALLY HAVE
A VERY POWERFUL EFFECT
  IF SUBJECTS SIMPLY EXPECT THEM TO WORK.
 AND BY "COUNTLESS STUDIES," YOU MEAN, LIKE,
  THE MOVIE "DUMBO"?
  YES, EXACTLY.
  MAGIC FEATHERS, SUGAR PILLS, LUCKY CHARMS --
  I MEAN, THE POINT IS THAT
  THERE'S A SCIENTIFICALLY QUANTIFIABLE VALUE TO BELIEF.
  WE JUST GOT TO HARNESS IT.
  Ross: ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GET THIS IN THE AD BLOCK
  AND MEET CLARK IN THE LOCKER ROOM.
Miles: GREAT.
  UH, SAM, MEGAN,
 CLARK ASKED IF YOU COULD HANG OUT WITH DAVID.
  WHY?
 YOUR PRESENCE IS GONNA
ELEVATE HIS TESTOSTERONE LEVELS,
  SO HE SAID NOT TO BE
AFRAID TO WEAR HEELS.
  SO, Y-YOU GUYS JUST... WELL, STAND THERE?
  OH, NO. WE'RE -- WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING.
  UM, YOU JUST CAN'T... SEE IT.
  WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING?
  [ CHUCKLES ]
  IT'S, UH, KIND OF A SUPERSTITION.
  WELL, 17 YEARS, I'VE ALWAYS PUT JACKIE'S
  INITIALS IN HERE BEFORE THE FIGHT.
  YEAH. SEE?
  OH, I-I STILL PUT "JK."
  HER, UM -- HER MAIDEN NAME WAS KLEIN.
  EVEN AFTER WE GOT MARRIED, YOU KNOW,
  I WAS AFRAID TO CHANGE THE ROUTINE, SO THAT'S...
  KIND OF CRAZY.
 NO. IT'S REALLY SWEET.
  SHE MUST MEAN A LOT TO YOU.
  YEAH. YEAH, SHE DOES.
  EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME, SHE'S NEVER MISSED A FIGHT.
  [ Chuckling ] SHE USED TO MOUTH THE WORDS "I LOVE YOU"
  BETWEEN ROUNDS, AND MORT WOULD GET ALL UPSET
  'CAUSE I WAS PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO HER THAN HIM.
  [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ]
  [ SLOT MACHINES RINGING ]
  Miles: I'M SAYING THERE SHOULD BE A GLUTEN-FREE VODKA OPTION, OKAY?
  MILES! MILES,
CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND?
  AM I IN TROUBLE? BECAUSE THIS IS ME ON MY BEST BEHAVIOR.
  NO. I THINK
WE'RE DOING THIS WRONG.
  MEGAN, THIS IS WAY ABOVE MY PAY GRADE, OKAY?
  CLARK HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR
  THAT HE THINKS THAT JACKIE REPRESENTS --
  AND YOU AGREE?
  I THINK IT'S HIGHLY POSSIBLE THAT HE IS RIGHT.
 HIGHLY POSSIBLE? MEGAN --
 LOOK, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT SCIENCE.
 IF YOU LISTENED TO ME,
YOU'D BE TRYING TO WIN
A FIGHT WITH PIGEONS,
  BUT I KNOW YOU LOVE STORIES.
 AND I AM TELLING YOU,
THIS IS A LOVE STORY.
  HE DOESN'T NEED JACKIE THERE
 BECAUSE OF WHAT SHE WILL OR
WON'T DO FOR HIS CONFIDENCE.
 HE NEEDS HER THERE BECAUSE SHE'S
THE REASON HE DOES ALL OF THIS.
 HE DOESN'T JUST WANT TO WIN.
HE WANTS TO WIN FOR HER.
 AND IF SHE'S NOT THERE,
 HE'S GONNA FORGET WHY HE WANTS
TO GET PUNCHED IN THE FACE,
 AND IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER
WHAT COLOR HE'S WEARING OR
WHAT YOU PUT ON SOME SCREEN.
  HE'S GONNA LOSE.
 I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT OF ANY OF THIS?
  WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?
  CLARK IS THE ONE --
BECAUSE CLARK HAS DECIDED.
  AND HE CAN'T LEAVE, ANYWAY.
  LEAVE?
I THINK WE NEED TO GO GET HER
AND CONVINCE HER TO COME HERE.
  THE FIGHT IS IN LIKE --
  IF WE LEAVE NOW, WE CAN MAKE IT.
  DO YOU THINK I'M WRONG?
  IF I HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS THAT I GOT FIRED OVER A GIRL,
  THEY'RE GONNA BE VERY...
  CONFUSED. [ LAUGHS ]
  GET THE CAR. I'M DRIVING, THOUGH.
  SO, THAT'LL WASH OFF, RIGHT?
  NO.
  BUT EVENTUALLY YOU'LL SHED THE SKIN.
  MILES ISN'T WITH YOU? NO, I THOUGHT HE WAS WITH YOU.
  I CAN'T FIND MEGAN, EITHER.
  JACKIE, YOU ARE HIS HEART.
  HE CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU.
  GOOD. THEN TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT.
 JACKIE -- YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN AT EVERY FIGHT, MEGAN --
  EVERY SINGLE ONE. I KNOW THAT HE WANTS ME THERE.
  DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I CAN'T BE THERE?
  I CAN'T ENABLE HIM ANYMORE.
  I'M ONLY MAKING IT WORSE IF I DO.
  HI. HELLO. CAN I JUMP IN?
  SORRY. UM...
  I KNOW THAT I'M NOT REALLY GOOD AT CONNECTING
  AND EXPLAINING THINGS TO LAY PEOPLE.
  FOR INSTANCE,
  I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T START BY CALLING THEM "LAY PEOPLE."
  BUT HERE'S THE THING.
  WITH OR WITHOUT YOU, DAVID'S GONNA FIGHT,
  AND WIN OR LOSE, IT'S HIS LAST FIGHT.
  NOW, I THINK THAT THERE'S A VERY STRONG PROBABILITY THAT,
  GIVEN THE DATA
  AND THE SCIENTIFICALLY VALIDATING STRATEGIES
  THAT WE'RE DEPLOYING, THAT HE'S GONNA WIN.
  AND, TRUTH BE TOLD,
THERE'S A REALLY STRONG ARGUMENT
  THAT YOU BEING THERE COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE HIM TO LOSE.
 THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?
  YEAH, MILES.
  BECAUSE THIS COMPLETELY UNQUALIFIED PERSON
  WHO'S STANDING NEXT TO ME,
  SHE CONVINCED ME THAT THIS ISN'T ABOUT A FIGHT,
  THAT WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE IS ACTUALLY...
  IT'S A LOVE STORY, AND -- AND, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
  THERE'S A SCIENCE TO HOW STORIES END.
  WHEN THEY TEST MOVIES AND TV SHOWS WITH AUDIENCES,
  THEY'VE FOUND THAT THE LAST FOUR MINUTES,
  A POSITIVE REACTION TO THAT FOUR MINUTES
  CAN MAKE AN AUDIENCE LOVE SOMETHING
  THAT THEY'D PREVIOUSLY HATED, AND CONVERSELY,
  A NEGATIVE REACTION TO THE LAST FOUR MINUTES
  CAN LEAVE THEM HATING SOMETHING THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY LOVED.
  DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEAN?
  OKAY, UM...
  98% OF THE STORY JUST DOESN'T REALLY MATTER
  IF YOU DON'T GET THE LAST 2% RIGHT.
  THE ENDING IS EVERYTHING.
  THEN... WHY DO YOU NEED ME?
  BECAUSE FOR YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND,
  THIS STORY'S NOT GONNA END IN THE RING.
  WHETHER HE'S HOLDING A TROPHY
  OR HE'S LAYING FACEDOWN ON THE MAT,
  HIS CAREER IS GONNA BE OVER AND HE'S GONNA LOOK FOR YOU.
  HE'S GONNA NEED YOU.
  AND A LOT OF SCIENCE,
  NOT TO MENTION A WHOLE BUNCH OF MOVIES THAT I'VE CRIED THROUGH,
  SAY THAT -- THAT THE HAPPY ENDING,
  THE ONE THAT FIXES EVERYTHING THAT CAME BEFORE IT,
  IS THE ONE WHERE YOU GUYS ARE JUST...
  THERE FOR EACH OTHER, NO MATTER WHAT.
  EVEN IF I WANTED TO, WE CAN'T MAKE IT.
  YEAH, THERE'S A CHANCE
  THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT THERE FOR THE BEGINNING,
  BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN CLEAR ABOUT WHICH PART COUNTS.
  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
  WELCOME TO FIGHT NIGHT AT THE HORSESHOE CASINO,
  BROUGHT TO YOU BY HITZ BOXING.
  FIGHTING OUT OF THE RED CORNER,
  WEARING THE BLACK TRUNKS WITH WHITE TRIM,

  â™ª NEVER, EVER SEEN YOU DOING CRIME WITH THE GLOCK â™ª

  â™ª YOU'S A LIAR, NEVER TYPE DUDE â™ª
  OKAY, WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR ENTRANCE MUSIC,
  HOOD ON, HEADPHONES ALL THE WAY UP.
  IGNORE THE CROWD. JUST FOCUS ON THE RING, OKAY?
 AND WHAT'S THIS NONSENSE
WE'RE GONNA HEAR SUPPOSED TO DO?
 SIMULATE THE WOMB, TURN CHAINSAW INTO A SLEEPY BABY.
  YEAH, A BABY WE'RE GONNA PUNCH IN THE FACE!
  WHOA.
  I'M SORRY. I-I'M JUST EXCITED.
 FIGHTING OUT OF THE BLUE CORNER, WEARING THE PINK --
  PINK TRUNKS WITH WHITE TRIM,
  WEIGHING IN AT 157 POUNDS,
  WITH A RECORD OF 44 WINS AND 6 LOSSES,
  DAVID BISHOP!
  [ RHYTHMIC BEATING, FLUTE MUSIC PLAY ]
  â™ª I CAPTURE THE MOMENT, CLEARLY CHECK THE PORES IN MY STATURE â™ª
  â™ª WITHOUT A CANE, I'M STANDING FIRM, MY AIM IS TO EARN â™ª
  â™ª HARD TO RESPECT, I CAN GET WHEN IT'S MY TURN â™ª
  â™ª CREATURE, I'LL MEET YOU AT THE TOP -- â™ª
  [ RHYTHMIC BEATING, FLUTE MUSIC PLAY ]
  COME ON! YEAH!
  COME ON, DAVID!
 ALL RIGHT, KID. REMEMBER
THE PLAN -- DEFEND AND RUN.
  YOU'RE NOT HERE TO FIGHT.
  YOU'RE HERE TO WATCH
A YOUNG MAN GET TIRED.
  IT'S GONNA WORK!
  EASY AS PUNCHING A BABY!
  [ BELL DINGS ]
  SON OF A BITCH, THIS JUST MIGHT WORK.
  [ LAUGHS ]
  RUN! MOVE, MOVE!
  [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]
  THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT. BOOM.
  NO! DAVID! DEFEND!
WHAT? WHAT?
 HE THINKS
HE SEES AN OPENING.
 HE'S GONNA TAKE A SHOT,
AND THEN --
  NO! NO!
  COME ON, GET UP!
  COME ON! GET UP! GET UP!
  [ BELL DINGS ]
HERE. GIVE ME THAT.
  LET'S NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN, ALL RIGHT, KID?
 COME ON. DODGE AND DEFEND TILL THE 6th.
  THEN WE PLAY OUR ACE
AND HE'S YOURS, ALL RIGHT?
  Ross: RIGHT! D&D;! D&D;! DODGE AND DEFEND!
  [ BELL DINGS ]
  HOW'S HE LOOK?
  HE LOOKS LIKE WHAT HE IS.
  AN OLD MAN WHO THOUGHT PINK SHORTS WOULD WIN A FIGHT.
  [ CROWD CHEERING ]
  [ BELL DINGING ]
  YES!
OKAY. LET'S GO.
  ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
  YOU MADE IT!
 ALL RIGHT, SIXTH ROUND! THAT'S IT.
 ALL RIGHT, SPIT. OKAY,
NOW KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN.
 LET THE S-SUBLIMINAL DISPLAY
DO ITS WORK, OKAY?
 AND THEN,
WHEN YOU GET BACK OUT THERE,
 YOU TAKE EVERYTHING
YOU HAVE LEFT,
 AND YOU LET IT LOOSE,
OKAY?
 YOU UNDERSTAND? YES.
  NOW HEAD DOWN. HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.
  [ DISCORDANT MUSIC PLAYS]
  DID YOU DO THIS?
  MILES.
  HE SEEMS A LITTLE DISTURBED.
  YEAH! OKAY, THAT'S IT!
 BRAIN MELTED! ALL RIGHT,
HE'S ALL YOURS, DAVID.
  DAVID, WHAT'S WRONG?
  I LOOKED.
WHAT?
  I-I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. HEY, UH...
  I LOOKED UP. I LOOKED UP, AND I SCRAMBLED MY BRAIN.
  NO, DAVID --
NO, I CAN'T FIGHT NOW, OKAY?
  DAVID, DAVID -- OKAY, I TRIED TO KEEP LOOKING DOWN,
 BUT WHEN I HEARD THE SOUND, I HAD TO LOOK UP.
  LOOK, THERE'S NO SUBLIMINAL MESSAGE!
  WHAT?
  IT'S A PLACEBO.
  THE POINT WAS TO GET YOU TO FOCUS
  ALL OF YOUR ENERGIES ON THIS ONE MOMENT,
  TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE IF YOU STRUCK NOW,
  YOU COULD WIN.
  SO, IT WASN'T REAL?
  I DIDN'T SAY IT WASN'T REAL. I SAID IT WAS PLACEBO.
  UGH, MAN. THIS ROUND IS STILL YOURS!
  EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO WIN IS INSIDE YOU!
 MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. I...
  LOOK, THE FIRST TEST THAT WE GAVE YOU...
  WAS TO BREAK YOUR CONFIDENCE.
  YOU LASTED LONGER THAN ANYBODY I'VE EVER SEEN.
  YOUR RESILIENCE, YOUR -- YOUR -- YOUR GRIT,
  YOUR MENTAL TOUGHNESS -- OFF THE CHARTS.
  THAT'S REAL. THAT'S IN YOU.
  LOOK AT HIM.
  YOU TIRED HIM OUT. THAT WASN'T ME.
  AND WHETHER YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND DOUBTS IT OR NOT
  DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
  WE JUST POURED ROCKET FUEL ON YOUR UNCONSCIOUS.
  YOU TURN YOURSELF LOOSE, AND YOU WILL WIN.
  OKAY?
 IT'S THE LAST THREE MINUTES OF YOUR CAREER, SON.
  MAKE 'EM COUNT. YES, SIR.
  [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 HE LOOKS PRETTY SCARED. YOU --
YOU THINK THIS CAN STILL WORK?
  I DON'T KNOW.
  THERE'S -- THERE'S SUDDENLY A LOT OF VARIABLES AT PLAY.
  UH, THERE WAS ONE STUDY THAT --
  CLARK! I HAVE NO IDEA!
  Man: COME ON, DAVID!
  AAH!
  Mort: COME ON, DAVID!
  PROTECT YOURSELF, DAVID!
  [ MUFFLED CHEERING ]
 THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT, BABY.
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
  GO, DAVID!
  [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
  [ BELL DINGS ]
  [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THE MAN IN PINK
  HAS JUST PULLED OFF A MIRACLE.
  [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
  BEAUTIFUL, BABY!
  [ LAUGHS ]
  I LOVE BOXING! IT'S SO ROMANTIC!
  OH!
 HEY, HEY!
  I GUESS PINK IS MY COLOR AFTER ALL.
YES!
  I CAN'T THANK YOU ALL ENOUGH.
  YOU KNOW WHAT?
  WE JUST PRIMED YOU TO DO WHAT
YOU KNEW YOU COULD DO ALL ALONG.
  BUT HONESTLY, I THINK JACKIE PROBABLY DID
  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
  SHE ALWAYS HAS.
  [ ALL CHEERING ]
  OLIVER, I AM TELLING YOU, I SAVED THIS CASE. YES.
  I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S GOING TOO FAR TO SAY THAT, LIKE,
  I WON A FIGHT.
  I WON A FIGHT, AND I'M GONNA CALL
 CANDY VANDERPOOL/MARK PATTERSON, AND I'M GONNA TELL HIM THAT --
  HER THAT -- "SHIM."
  I DON'T KNOW, OKAY, BUT -- BUT LISTEN,
  WE'RE GOING OUT TO CELEBRATE.
  YES. UH-HUH. WE...
  OKAY. OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
  I'LL -- WELL, I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I'M DONE.
  [ INHALES DEEPLY ] OKAY, BYE.
  [ SIGHS ] [ KNOCK ON DOOR ]
  HEY. HEY!
  THERE HE IS, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN THE BLUE CORNER,
  DRESSED LIKE AN OSCAR WILDE IMPERSONATOR.
 THANK YOU. THANK YOU. [ CHUCKLES ] HEY.
  UM...
  CAN I ASK
YOUR ADVICE ON SOMETHING?
 SO, UH, I'VE BEEN DATING THIS NEW GUY --
  HEY, I'M THE LAST PERSON
  YOU WANT TO BE ASKING DATING ADVICE FROM.
  BUT -- [ SCOFFS ]
UH, IT'S A JOKE, RIGHT?
 [ Chuckling ] YES, YES,
ROSS, YOU ARE THE LAST PERSON
  THAT I WOULD ASK DATING ADVICE FROM.
  I'M NOT SURE THE LAUGHTER IS NECESSARY.
 NO, THIS IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE IN YOUR WHEELHOUSE.
  UM, THIS NEW GUY IS REALLY GREAT --
  NICE PERSONALITY,
GOOD LISTENER, AMAZING ARMS.
  MILES. BUT, UH, HE'S BEEN ASKING
  THESE REALLY ODDLY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS LATELY.
  LIKE WHAT?
 LIKE ABOUT WHERE I GREW UP, ABOUT MY PARENTS...
  NORMAL DATING STUFF.
  ...HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MAKE,
 THE NAME OF THE STREET THAT I GREW UP ON,
  MY FIRST PET'S NAME.
  LESS NORMAL.
  YEAH, AND, SAM, SHE TOLD ME FLAT-OUT
  THAT SHE MET HIM IN A WORK PROGRAM,
  THAT HE HAS A CRIMINAL RECORD.
  SAM INTRODUCED YOU TO HIM?
RIGHT.
  AND THEN SHE TOLD YOU HE HAD A HISTORY?
 YES. RIGHT. AND -- AND IT -- IT MIGHT BE NOTHING.
 IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.
PLEASE LET IT BE NOTHING.
  I JUST -- I-I KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS,
 AND I WANTED TO GET YOUR -- YOUR TAKE ON IT.
  SO...DO YOU THINK I'M BEING PARANOID?
  ROSS?
  AH, I'M SURE IT'S NOTHING,
 BUT IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER, I WILL SQUARE IT WITH SAM.
  OH, THANK YOU. YES!
  MIND AT EASE.
  [ DOOR OPENS ]
  WHEW! [ SIGHS ]
  [ DOOR CLOSES ]
  WHERE THE HELL IS SAM?
  SHE SAID SHE HAD A THING.
