 Soon-taek, I don't care if I die. But I won't die regretting my decisions. I will never die with regret. I'm going to go as far as I can, to where my heart leads me. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR -Hello, ma'am. -It's good to see you. Hae-young didn't answer my calls. I see. She's in her room. Please go in. Let's go.

 Did you know I'd come? You're ready to go? Why don't you dress up like her? -We'll be back. -Okay. Go somewhere far from here. Like a beach. She might not come back tonight. -Where should we go? -I don't know. If you don't feel like talking, you don't have to. Can I just turn some music on? You must be upset as well Seeing me in tears I'm sorry What a coincidence. The lyrics are exactly how you feel. Me, who loved you Me, who was half crazy

 Me, who dreamed for you I hope you will look back at me once And cry for me I wish my memories Would still prickle you I wish the wind would feel cold to you On days you hear about me I hope you would notice My lingering heart I hope my wishes and my foolish love Will hurt you even more I thought my life would be so cool in my 30s. I thought I'd have my own place and a car and travel abroad at least once a year. I have no idea why I expected my 30s would be like that. Maybe you thought you'd earn a lot, easily. I thought my love life would be cool, too. But I'm suffering from love like a fool. Still, I envy you that you suffer from love without regret. I've never done that. Are you two over? Yes. He dumped me. That's not exactly true though. You knew you two couldn't be together. He put an end to the relationship for you. He took on the role of the bad guy. He didn't want to make you the bad girl, too. Hee-ran, that means he doesn't love me that much. Hey, it's not that he doesn't love you enough, but he doesn't know how to love. Guys don't know that hurts us more. Tae-jin is the same, too. He didn't want you to feel pressured to wait for him. So he dumped you with a ridiculous excuse. Waiting for her boyfriend in jail and living with hurtful memories of what he said to her. Guys don't know which is more painful to us. We just want to stay with them no matter what happens. Right? Gosh. Will I ever be able to dump guys? What about your next boyfriend? You should dump him no matter what. Should I? Okay. Whoever becomes my boyfriend next, I'll dump him for sure. If you don't, I'll follow you around and grill you until you dump him. "Hae-young, it's a once-in-a-lifetime chance for you to dump a guy! Dump him. Go ahead!" Just dump him for the sake of it? Of course. My goodness! My hat. It's an expensive one. Fine. I'll go get it. Oh, my gosh! Oh, my. Hey! Why didn't you buy some clothes and change? Why did you walk around in wet clothes all day? It wasn't long ago that you got soaked last time. It's nice. Your dad and I are moving away. Come with us. You wanted to move to the countryside. Let's go live with your grandma in Cheongju. I'm going back to work tomorrow. You don't have to force yourself to stay there. Just quit. Just quit and move with us. It's more humiliating to run away. I want to start over where I am. Your daughter is strong. This won't kill me. I even survived my wedding getting called off. Don't talk like that. I'm on the internet now. -You can find me by searching my name. -What an honor to your family. Who is it? Look. I'll tell Hae-young to call you. You should go. Right now! We have to run! Oh, gosh. Whose hand are you holding right now? Please don't take off your clothes. I won't. I don't like him enough to do that. I'm sorry. They say that you can read a person by looking in their eyes. But your eyes deceived me. I guess you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. When you're the one who ruined her life, my daughter went head over heels for you. And I put a piece of meat on your bowl like an idiot. Both my daughter and I are idiots. I'm sorry. I could have barged in where you live. But I didn't do that. Instead, I figured we should cut ties with you completely. Still, let me tell you this. What goes around comes around. If you hurt someone, you'll get hurt even worse someday. You broke up a young, happy couple. You hurt my precious daughter. You'll pay for it. Of course, you will. You must. After what my daughter went through. I'm sorry. Well... He's here. I'm sorry. What's the use of cursing you? I take back my words! I'll just give him a punch instead. Go in. Keep your eyes down in front of other people from now on. Your eyes play on people's sympathies. I was about to call you all kinds of names. -Go in. -Let's go in. Why do you keep blaming his eyes? Let's go in. Come on. Come. Just go. Why are you here? I missed you. I'm sorry... I'm late. Gosh. I don't understand you. You didn't bat an eye when I begged you. Just when I'm starting to move on, you're here. -I'm sorry. -It's obvious we're not meant to be. We're never on the same page. It's all over. Don't come here again. I got my deposit back. I won't say anything to the landlord. Just make sure you pay the rent on time so that he won't call me. I'm sorry. I was wrong. I'll never be a coward to you. I'll stop being fickle. No matter what happens, I'll never let go of you. I'm going to stop being fickle too. I've decided to give you up. I already did. I know you're angry at me. Do you think I'm playing hard to get? You know I'm not good at that. Or am I so easy for you that you think you can win me over any time? You know that's not true. I like you too. But I tried to push you away. You won't have to do that anymore. I'll never cling to you again. If we happen to run into each other, let's not say hi and just pass each other by. Don't try to pretend that you're happy to see me. I'm not good at those things. I'm not crying. I just have a runny nose. I'm not sad. I just have a cold. Don't get me wrong. Thank you for letting me dump you. I don't need a lamp any longer. Let's go and beg. Chairman Jang is capable of anything. Let's go beg him. Please. Do-kyeong. Let's go and beg him. Do-kyeong. Things go just the way I saw. We've come a long way to go back to our original partners. Just the way I saw. As you said, the visions I've been seeing were my recollections I'd see as I'm dying. Of the moments I regret. The visions won't change or help me with anything. But why do I keep seeing them? "Our lives are nothing but looking back from a point where time has ended." Whenever I feel like I'm wasting my life on something useless, I read this phrase. "Our lives are nothing but looking back from a point where time has ended." What if everything in our lives is fixed and is already over, and what we think is happening now is actually our spirits reminiscing about the past? It must feel so vain. Don't you think? Or make you live carelessly. Actually, it's the opposite. If you truly accept it, you'll feel really comfortable. You'll begin looking into your heart. Right now, what does your heart want the most? Your life is a story written by your heart. Don't try to change the situation around you. Just try to relax more and look into your heart. Find out what your heart wants to do. I've never comfortably revealed my heart to anyone before. I only showed myself a little to not get hurt by others. Always less than the other person. And always rougher than the hostility they showed me. I'd change my stance based on the other's response. I've never opened my heart to others freely. Once we admit that things disappear, we won't be obsessed with useless things. Now, I don't fear death at all. But the fact that I didn't give more love when I could have, and that I didn't give her love even when I wanted to, and that I made her life difficult because I was hard on her. That weighs on my mind. Hello. Hi. Hello. Hello. Oh, hello. It's been a long time, hasn't it? -Aren't you getting in? -Yes, yes. I wanted to take a longer break, but I couldn't. I ran out of holidays. Don't I look a lot better? I've lost two kilos. This skirt is loose now. Maybe I should cause another issue so I can lose another two kilos. I'm fine. I'm totally fine. Please talk comfortably. I see. Are you really all right? Of course. She looks fine. What's with the flowers? I bought them. I thought I'd look less shabby with flowers. -I see. -Goodness. I'm really okay, I mean it. Please laugh if you want. Of course, that's Ms. Oh. I didn't know Do-kyeong was involved. I'm sorry. Everyone is saying sorry to me. I've never had people apologize to me so much. But it doesn't feel great. I feel like I'm the fussy one. I'm sorry. I really am. Actually, I'm not sorry. Do-kyeong is in distress. Tell him he doesn't need to be. It's all over now. Actually, I have no right to meddle and tell him what to do. I don't care anymore. I'm fine. From now on, I'll stop caring about men and not think about love, like you. That's how I'll live my life. I'll live a cool, confident, and independent life. By the way, did something happen while I was off from work? I've never seen you without high heels on. It's because my feet swole up. You put a mark on your face, too. -What do you mean? -Right here. -A mark? -There. There it is. It's a crumb. You never used to enjoy snacks. I needed some sugar. I'm sorry. That's fine. I actually feel comfortable after getting exposed to everyone. It feels like I ran a marathon naked. I've got nothing to worry about or hide anymore. This must be the league I'm supposed to be in, I guess. I thought of quitting the job, too. But I thought I'd never be able to overcome anything if I quit now. You're the pretty Oh Hae-young, and I'm the ordinary Oh Hae-young. I was afraid we would stay that way forever if I quit. When I was compared to you as a teenager, I think I started believing the idea that I wasn't good enough. I still think that. In anything I do actually. I'll try to overcome that by being where you are, watching you. You're still the same. You get over things easily and quickly. -Do I? -You were the same back then. You would bawl your eyes out as if the world was ending, but then later you'd be laughing as if nothing happened. It was awkward. I worried about you. Will you really not have a drink with me? Later. When? When will you drink with me? Sometime. I'll get going. I'm completely done with Do-kyeong. Good luck. Okay. It's all clean now. Do-kyeong and Hae-young. They didn't break up because they got sick of each other or grew to hate each other. They broke up painfully while they still love each other It makes me even more sad. I'm not his most painful love anymore. If we couldn't love each other again, I wanted to remain as his most painful love, at least. It's done. Keep going. It's all clean now. Hello? Yes, Ms. Kim. No, no. I'm just at home. Right now? No, it's completely fine. Yes. Sure. Yes, I'll be right over. -Okay. -Who is it? The film producer. What is it? Is something wrong with the sound? No, she wants us to work on my script. She's interested. If she likes it, then it's a done deal. Yes! Eat before you go! I just made kimchi fried rice. Now that I've read it again... I like the characters. Let's fix it up a bit, then give it out to actors. Once we have a good cast, the funds will automatically roll in. First... Let's give it to Jung-min. No, is a handsome guy better? What if a really handsome guy plays a nerdy role? That's it. Let's give it to Jung-jae first. Right. No matter how I look at it, this part bothers me. The action here isn't catastrophic enough. You need to write this well to hook the actors. Yes. I was a little... I was bothered by this part, too. -You were stuck, weren't you? -Yes. I'll make sure to fix that this time. Could I just get a day? Or two... No, three. No, no. I'll sort it out in two days. -She didn't drink. That's rare. -I know, right? Excuse me, could you walk me home? I'm... pregnant. Please walk me home. What am I going to do? Is it the guy you talked about last time? He doesn't know it's his child yet. He thinks it's someone else's baby. Are you going to keep it? Didn't you say he was nothing but trouble? You said he was seeing this woman and that... Gosh. That's not the only problem. Whether a rapist or a serial killer, he'd represent anyone that pays him. He's known to be a trashy lawyer. He doesn't have an inch of conscience in him. How can he claim their innocence so shamelessly? Hey... The baby will be okay, right? Objectively speaking... he's a total piece of trash. Subjectively... I like him... because I slept with him. Why don't you ask him? Who knows? He might want to marry you. No way. That's impossible. Aside from me being pregnant with his baby, he'll have a fit if he finds out that we slept together. I've known him since he was 14 years old. He used to walk around naked in front of me. If he finds out what happened between us... JIN-SANG Hey, I just asked six different men. They all said they wouldn't marry a woman that got pregnant after a one-night-stand. They would tell her to get rid of it. Such jerks. Me? I'd move abroad right away. Who cares if she has it or not? I'd run as fast as I can. I'll live in the outskirts of England, and change my name to William Sutherland. Yes. Okay, hold on for a minute. Hey, listen to me. Pay attention. She's going to have the baby. She's 44 years old. It might be her last chance to have one. Of course she wants it. She's going to have it, but the question is should she tell the man before having the baby? So here is a question. Would you prefer to live your life not knowing that you have a kid, or would you prefer to know about it? Raise your hands if you prefer not to know. Okay, two. Raise your hands if you think you should know. Four. Two to four. Soo-kyeong, it's two against four. They prefer to know. Even I agree. He should know about it. To live your life not knowing that you have a kid out there... That's a little... What can I say? It's as if I have a bomb somewhere at home, but I'm the only one who doesn't know. Ma'am, you must tell him, okay? You should tell him for sure. You're going to raise the kid in peace. What will he do? Tell him. Call him right now and just tell him. Okay, don't worry. I'll tell him. I'll... tell him for sure. Yes, you should just tell him. Shall we eat something good? Oh, you're here. This is my property. Why are you tenants making your own deals? Who are you to give her back the deposit and kick her out? You desperately wanted to kick her out and that was your solution? Gosh. I luckily dropped by and caught you. If I didn't find out, were you planning on using the space yourself? You're sly. I told you. I won't give you that room. Listen, miss. Just like it says on the contract, I'll give you the deposit in a year. Until then, you have to pay rent or I'll take it from the deposit. He'll pay the rent on time. No. I didn't give this room to him. I gave it to you. I already got my deposit from him. I have nothing to lose. Why would you take that from him? I'm the owner. Why did you sign the contract if you'll do whatever you want? The deal you two had is invalid. I'll see you in a year. You can't use this room, all right? I don't want to come back here in a year. I want to end it right now. I'll give you as much as you want. Don't force someone to stay if they don't want to. Can you... just come back? I'd like for you to come back. -I'll take you home. -No, thanks. Yes, Tae-jin. I'm on my way. HAN TAE-JIN You don't look good. I have a cold. -Did you take some medicine? -I did. I'm sorry I got you two wrong. I thought you were seeing him. I thought he ruined my life to win you away from me. I am sorry. Eat some. It's good. I had been waiting to knock him down. The whole thing was just a misunderstanding. -I can't believe-- -Please stop talking about him. I don't want to hear about him. I'm sorry. I just don't feel well. Please have some. My nose is runny. Let's not see each other anymore. I think we should stop here. Let's just see each other with a light heart. You don't have to cut me off now. Let's continue a bit longer. If you really think we should end it, we can break up then. I'm sorry. I'm home. -Did you have dinner? -I did. -What about medicine? -I took it. But you still don't look well. The fever hasn't gone down yet? -It's better than yesterday. -But you grew even hoarser. Isn't it sexy? What a crazy... Are you broadcasting that you live alone? He had change. Didn't you say they're too tight? I think they've loosened up a bit. It's all right. Have a good day. Do-kyeong, a guest is here to see you. Wow. Your office is very nice, isn't it? Shouldn't you have visited me first? MOVIE SOUND CEO PARK DO-KYEONG "CEO Park Do-kyeong." I used to be a CEO, too. And everything blew up because of a jerk. You'd better be careful. That can happen anytime if someone puts their mind to it. I won't stop you. Do whatever you want. When you crashed into my car, you said you ruined me by mistake. It was a mistake then, but this was on purpose. You said you crashed my car on purpose. You were already in love with her then? Was it because you got angry, seeing the girl you like suffering from what I said to her? You should've stopped there. You shouldn't have gone that far. What were you thinking? Now everyone knows what happened to us. What will you do? We have no choice, but to go back to where we belong. That's what we must do. If people find out that you stole my girlfriend, I can no longer live in Korea. It's all up to you now. I can either ruin your life, or forget about everything. So, let's go back to where we used to be. You had a girl you loved, too. She's the reason for this mess. I'll take that as a yes. I'll go now. We've come a long way to go back to our original partners. THE ADVENTURER Wow, you worked on this film too? You've worked on many famous ones. -I don't want to get back to work. -What... -Goodbye. -Take care. -Who is he? -I don't know. He's very charismatic, isn't he? You couldn't work it out, right? I mean... I tried hard. I guess it was hard all by yourself. -Please give me another day-- -We can figure it out together. Let's go. Sorry? Okay. This is so hard. I watched more than 100 action movies to solve this, but it didn't help. It's not going anywhere. I'm so tired. I think I should lie down. Then I'll leave now. It's okay. Go on. We have to get it done today. I'll just take a little nap. Okay. It's so hot. I'll go and change. Why is she changing? Is she trying to hit on me? Should I leave? What should I do? This is bad. What do I do? Should I just pack up and go? -Do you want to drink anything? -I'm okay. RESERVE FORCES TRAINING GROUND What should I do? What should I do? I NEED TO LEAVE THIS IS BAD Take a break. Hello? Hey, Do-kyeong. I can't hear you. Are you okay? Are you all right? I'm okay. I'm fine. I... I just dropped my phone. It's just... Did you think I was coming on to you? Are you crazy? THE BOTTLE OPENER OF LUST BY PARK HOON The Bottle Opener of Lust. This theater has an amazing audio system. Find out how amazing the sounds you worked on turned out. -Let's have dinner after. -Okay. Die, you jerk! Hey! Seriously... Let go. Stop. Let go!  Yes! Park Do-kyeong is finally mine! Can you just stay by my side for a while and break up later? Let's date in secret for a while then break up. If I dump you now just to save face, I think I'll regret it for a long time. Where are you going? I said we shouldn't say hi if we run into each other. I'm sorry I talked to you. Change your shoes. It sounds uncomfortable. I know something very shocking that will stop your suffering immediately. But I can't tell you what it is. I'd love to, but I might get in big trouble for it. But I'm sure this can stop-- I... know of a way to make you stop talking right away. Fine. I won't tell him. If we had similar tastes, I could take you around somewhere fun. Do you want to go clubbing with me tonight? Do you? Why are you lying down there? I'm exhausted. Go upstairs, then. I have no energy left. Gosh. I'm home. Did you have dinner? Yes. What happened? My legs are numb. I'm going to sleep all day tomorrow. Don't wake me up. Do you still have a cold? Why isn't the medicine working? -Do you want to get an IV? -It's okay. I'm getting better. Hae-young. I got some feedback. -On what? -Take a look at this. -Please lower that. -This one? -Yes. -Okay. Hey. Look at this. Wearing shoes that are a bit too small for me helps me not think about him too much. The pain in my feet distracts me. Once I get home and take those shoes off, -I'll be happy for a split second. -I'm home. Because my memories of you suddenly pop into my mind... When I break down at the thought of you from the most random things, "Be sick. I hope I'm sick." I want to get more sick. Every time I wake up in the middle of the night to check my phone, and when I'm walking forward but my heart is crying to turn back, I wish I was sick. I want to get more sick. When it hurts so much that I can't lift a finger and I'm sick enough to lose my consciousness, my thoughts of him disappear. The stronger the fever, my memories of him get weaker. It puts my heart at ease the more I get sick. OH HAE-YOUNG 3 TIMES A DAY Hae-young! Hae-young! Hey, Hae-young! Hae-young! Hae-young! Hae-young! Hae-young! Hae-young! Honey! Hae-young, wake up. -Open your eyes, Hae-young. -Please be careful. Open your eyes. Wake up. Hey, wake up. Hae-young. Hae-young. Hurry. Hae-young. I'm seeing things. How can I think of him as soon as I'm a little better? It makes me furious. Can I take this off now? -Why? You should take more. -I don't want to. Press on it for a while. Don't be sick. Nice running into you here. It would have been unfair if I was sick alone. I'm glad you're sick, too! Even if we go back in time, I'd still ruin your wedding and I'd make you move in next door to meet with you again. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I'm not sorry about ruining your wedding! Sorry. This is how I really feel though. I'm sick from wanting to hold you. It will be better for her, for us to love as much as we can before I go, right? It's so nice to see you first thing in the morning. -That dream! -That's right. It was for the baby. You jerk. You crazy bastard! We probably can't separate them even if we tried. You're sentenced to life with Park Soo-kyeong. I'm sorry. You completely made a fool of me. However, I can't help it. My love is more important to me. Subtitle translation by
