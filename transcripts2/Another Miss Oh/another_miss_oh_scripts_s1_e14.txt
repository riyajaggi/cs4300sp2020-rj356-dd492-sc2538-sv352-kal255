 You're my medicine. I'm all right now. My fever has gone down. It must have been hard for you. You did well. Both of us. We did well. If you didn't push that hard, we wouldn't even be here. Thank you. I thought you'd give up after apologizing a few times. I imagined

 what it would be like if I was dying. If I was looking back at these moments. The conclusion is that nothing matters. "I don't need to be cautious. I should go as far as my heart wants. I shouldn't hold back anything." I like that. "I should go as far as my heart wants. I shouldn't hold back anything." I'd only met petty guys. They were all busy thinking about their gains and losses. They left me because they were ashamed of their failures. No one has ever touched my heart and moved me. I was waiting to be moved. I'm so unbelievably happy right now. If I ever see you having second thoughts,

 -I'll kill you. -Kill me. Don't be fickle, otherwise you're dead meat. I won't be fickle. I'm going to be fickle. Sure. You can be. Oh, no. Oh, my goodness. -Where have you been? -Relax. Where were you? We thought you died. We went looking for you throughout the hospital. Where were you? I came home because I felt better. Why didn't you tell us you were going home? I couldn't find you anywhere. Medicines work so fast on young brats like you. In the visions from before, you broke up and that was it. But you got back together... So... it changed. It changed! Do-kyung! Congratulations! Park Do-kyung, you made it! You changed your destiny! What's up with your face? You seem so nonchalant. Shouldn't you be excited? It will be better for her for us to love as much as we can before I go, right? Leave? Why would you leave? Why would you die? Now that things changed, why would you die? Before, you let her go. And you regretted it while dying. But you're back together. It's different now. The present changed, how could the future not? This is why there's flaws in predestination and the most famous prophets get it wrong. Your mind is stronger than anything else. Love is stronger than anything else. Love! What? Are you worried? Are you worried that you'll leave her behind? There's only one thing you need to do. Love... as much as you can. I'm so jealous! What are you doing? I'm going to work. I just left home. What about you? -I'm going to work too. -Oh, my goodness. You surprised me. Gosh. -It's nice seeing you in the morning. -Come on. I'll give you a ride. I feel like I could do anything. I could even murder someone. Pull yourself together. Just pick one. I'll kill him. I get it, Mom. Don't worry. I won't do it. Okay. I love you. A rooftop party, rooftop party A rooftop party You're still three years old. Only three-year-olds dance as soon as they wake up. Ask me why I'm doing this. -I can't be bothered. Just say it. -I'm going to be successful! I had a fantastic dream last night. Mom said I shouldn't tell anyone. It's just between us. My mom says this is an amazing dream. Amazing! I don't usually dream. I've never had such a vivid dream. What was it about? The stars in the sky were sparkling like gold. All of a sudden, they formed the shape of a fish. Then it started to flop around as if it was alive. It fell straight from the sky, and I caught it with-- Did you really catch it? You didn't drop it? Of course, I did. It fell right into my hands. Why are you trying to take it away from me? When I opened my eyes, I felt... excited, but somehow very calm. It felt like I heard God's voice. "Your time has come." -I'll buy it for 5,000 won. -Are you crazy? Don't sell that dream. Don't sell it for hundreds of millions. Of course, I won't. Mom says I'll be the Minister of Justice. Hey, stop it. We're eating breakfast. Let's meet tonight. I'll treat you to something good. I know a great steak restaurant. How would you live without me? I'm the only one who takes care of you. Just tell your family already. They'll find out when it shows anyway. Have you told the man? Why? What is it? You don't have the man's phone number? Don't you have his email address? That jerk. Tell me everything you know about him. I'll ask around. He's not the baby's father. What? What are you talking about? It's not him. But you didn't see any guy other than him. Gosh, was it a one-night-stand? It's none of your business. Oh, my God. -Is it from a one-night-stand? -I said it's none of your business. I'll raise my baby by myself anyway. So I'll just keep it secret. It's not the guy moving to Brazil. Your misunderstanding can ruin an innocent guy's family. So don't blab about him to others. And... I'll move abroad. What? Why? If I live here, people will bother me, asking who the baby's father is. It will be a bad influence on my baby. It's right to raise the baby alone in another country. It'd be really hard to raise a baby abroad alone. Just stay here. You have Do-kyung and me. We'll help you. I won't turn my back on you even if I become successful. Just raise the baby here. -Don't leave. -Be quiet. Stop it. Change your mind. I'm late. Let's go. We're here. Soo-kyung, see you in the evening. Cheer up! It will be all right. If I tell you it's your baby, I'm sure you'll pass out, and things will become awkward between us. So I think it's better to keep it secret and raise the baby alone. Let's just remain friends like we are now. Thank you for dreaming about the baby. I'll remember your dream. Stars and fish. How interesting. You don't need to explain to me. People can split up and get back together again anytime. It's as fickle as the weather. We won't split up again. Please don't. Ever. Congratulations. REPORT CARD CLASS RANK: 1 GRADE RANK: 2 Oh, dear God. She must've gone crazy! She's gone crazy! Honey, Hae-young must've gone crazy. What is that? She ranked first in her class and ranked second in her grade. She's ranked second out of 500. SCHOOL RANK: 2 Of course, she'll go to Seoul National University. Okay. Goodbye. Who are you calling now? -Your brother's. -Please stop it. Why? I had to put up with her bragging about her daughter my whole life. Now, it's my turn. She never would've seen this coming. Of course. It's me. Did you have dinner? Yes. Did Seo-hui get her report card? Well, Hae-young missed first place in her class by a narrow margin. I'll get it. I think our report cards have been switched. I'll give you yours tomorrow. I'll give it to you tomorrow at school. Would it be okay... if my parents signed yours? Then, I'll get my parents' signature on yours too. CLASS RANK: 29 GRADE RANK: 218 -Hae-young. -Yes? I usually rank first or second in my class. But I didn't study this time. I just guessed on everything. I think I'll get divorced again. I want to get out of this house. Dear me. I knew it. It didn't make sense. Oh Hae-young. B, C, C, D, D, C, D, B, C... My blood ran cold for nothing. I thought Hae-young ranked second in her class. -Why did your blood run cold? -Sorry? Oh, you're right. I don't know why that made my blood run cold. It's okay. Eat! How could they put two Oh Hae-youngs in the same class? It's hard to believe that you were fooled. She never ranked above 200. How could you believe that she got second place so easily? Of course, that wasn't her report card. My goodness. I laughed a lot thanks to you. OH HAE-YOUNG Are you that Oh Hae-young? Yes. Your eyes are too big. It's okay. Grades aren't important. That day, I had a feeling that I'd never be able to defeat you. There's no way at all to beat someone who's raised with love. This is a buy one get one free deal. You can grab another one. THE BOTTLE OPENER OF LUST BY PARK HOON Did you think I was coming on to you? Thank you. Bye. Why are you so depressed this morning? I... I think I discovered the reason I can't succeed. What is it? I can't succeed because I love you. Who is trying to hit on you? -Can she make you successful? -That's amazing. You're really quick. I can sense it with my whole body. Maybe I have a sixth sense. Good boy. It's not easy to reject a woman, and you managed to reject a woman who can make you successful. Good boy. Here. Eat this sausage. Welcome. If I keep on loving you and become successful at the same time... What should we do? They will mow the barley field tomorrow. We're in a hurry to get down there right now. What time tomorrow? They will do it in the morning. How can you manage the schedule so poorly? I'm sorry. What will you do? I'd be grateful if you could come, but I won't force you. Record the sound somewhere else if you can. I see. Okay. We should go. We'll have to go all the way to Gochang if we don't. But they'll mow the field by next week too. Why would they mow that pretty field? -To harvest barley, of course. -Wasn't the field ornamental? Do you think we can get there and return tonight? When will you come back, then? Tomorrow? OH HAE-YOUNG No way. I can't see you until tomorrow? All right then. Your work should come first. Okay. See you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow if I'm alive until then. I won't see you tomorrow if I die longing for you. Let's see if I can survive. Bye. Hi. What is it? -I need to ask you a favor. -Go on. Can you have Hae-young work out of the office today? -So she can get off when she's done. -You're joking. -Won't you do it? -I won't. -Please, just once. -Forget it. I'll be good, I promise. You idiot. I can't believe him. -Won't she do it? -No. -Hello. -Hi. -I will do that. -What should we prepare? Let me see. Who bought these snacks? I did because I felt sorry for you. Everyone. If you want to hang out with me, today is the only day. From tomorrow on, I'll be busy for the rest of my life. Forever. It's good to hear that. Here, catch. Please excuse us. Are you Ms. Oh Hae-young? She is. -Ms. Oh Hae-young? -Yes, that's me. We're from the Seobu Police Station. Is your cell phone number 072... And 11... -It's 1131. -That was it. Thank you. -Is that correct? -Yes, it is. You've violated the Telecommunications Act. You must come with us. -Pardon? -Detective Go, take her. -What? -Are you seriously taking her? -No, it's... -My gosh, Hae-young. I think you're mistaken. I've done nothing wrong. Yes, we know. Do you know there are two Oh Hae-youngs? -Yes, we know. -Oh, I see. -My goodness, Hae-young. -Ms. Oh! -Do you want this? -Stop it! -Come on. -What are you doing? -She must've done something wrong. -Quiet. MANAGER KIM SEONG-JIN Hello? Hae-young, what's going on? Somebody must have done something illegal under my name. If I find out who it is... Please don't use your cell phone. Turn it off. If you continue using it, you'll be charged with a crime, okay? The more you use it, the more fines you'll have to pay. I'll call you later. YOUR PHONE WILL SHUT DOWN Do I need to pay even when I receive a call? -They'll charge you when the phone rings. -Damn it. What's wrong with my phone? When did this happen? How much was I charged? It will be remitted, right? Do I really need to pay all that? I won't need to pay if I explain it to the carrier. Stop! Gosh, you sure talk a lot. She is really loud. Can you please keep your mouth shut? Officer Go. I think the suspects are there. Over there. There they are. That guy wearing the cap is the worst. He's really mean too. -Stop over there. -Okay. Good to see you. What delayed you? We're late already. Which road should we take? -How did you take her out? -There's always a way, you know. Well done. You surprised me! Everybody, sleep, except the driver. What kind of bullshit is that? You can't sleep. Giddy up. We got lucky. It's windy today. There's not much dialogue in this film. So sound plays a crucial role. I'll count on you. I need to go. See you at the next spot. We're going to Mallipo Beach now. We don't have much time, so let's move quickly. We can go by ourselves. Don't worry about us and have fun. We'll pick you up when we're done. -Good luck. -Have fun! Are you sure you want to stay here? Why don't we drop you off downtown so you can go and relax? Wouldn't that be better? Idiot. Gosh, watch your mouth. This mouth of yours. Let's go! Let's go. There's no one here. Give me a big hug. Come! It's still daytime. Let's go. What do you mean? I wasn't going to do anything. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. Why didn't you call me? Custom's been bugging me to come over all morning. You expanded the office. Seems like it's better than when I was the CEO. It's funny how things work out. Soon after you left, we started selling in Europe. Then banks started to beg us to borrow money from them. When we desperately wanted loans, they didn't bat an eye. What can I do here? What should I do? Take your time. You just got out. Did you work it out with Hae-young? Wasn't it difficult? There's nothing to work out. Are you worried I won't give you a job? We went through a lot together. Sort things out with Hae-young and get married first. If you become busy with work, she might feel neglected. That's your priority. Let's go and eat something. The number you have dialed is currently unavailable. Please leave a message... Is this the Seobu Police Station? Her name is Oh Hae-young. Yes. Two men, who claimed to be from the Seobu Police Station, took her with them. They don't work with us. They don't? Gosh. They are not police officers. No, they aren't. -Can you zoom in on that car? -Yes. -They know what they are doing. -They do? They managed to hide their license plate. Then what should we do? Pardon me. We're police officers. Does Ms. Oh Hae-young live here? Ms. Oh Hae-young was kidnapped by unidentified assailants. We're searching for them. Well... There's another girl with the same name. There's another Oh Hae-young other than my daughter. -Ma'am. -Ma'am. -Wake up. -Are you okay? Ma'am. The sound of a barking dog in a small country village in the evening. The sound we're listening to right now is my favorite. I also love to hear the sound of the snow being shoveled away under blankets on a winter morning. Clatter, tap-tap. The sound of a small boy running down a hill around four in the afternoon. Tap... And... the sound of a music box. It's pretty. The sound. And there's a sound I want to hear. You calling my name. You've never called me Hae-young. I guess that name still reminds you of her. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm giving you a hard time again. It's only natural. You called her that name for a long time. I can't because I'm worried you would think that. You might think that I'm calling someone else. You might suspect that she's on my mind. Maybe you're right. But unfortunately, my name is also Hae-young. Just call me by my name. I won't think about her when I look at you. I hope you'll be able to say my name without feeling uncomfortable. I have a favor to ask. Whatever Han Tae-jin does to me, don't get involved. Whatever he does, I should let him. I clearly did wrong. And you're with me now. So whatever happens to me, stay out of it. You shouldn't think of Oh Hae-young when you look at me, and I should make it up to Han Tae-jin. Let's do that. Also, stop calling me just "you." It's weird. Then what should I call you? You know. What? You know. What? Do-kyung. Hae-young. Do-kyung. Hae-young. Do-kyung. Hae-young. Do-kyung. Hae-young. It's been ten times. Done. -Open your eyes. -What? Look at the stars. Should we die together tonight? I want to die when I'm so happy. Park Do-kyung! Park Do-kyung! Why aren't you answering me? I know you're in there. You're surrounded right now. What kind of outrageous date is this? This is someone's barley field. You made us go through so much. Wrap up whatever you're doing, and come out. Hurry up! I admit, you look like detectives. All right. You impersonated detectives, and obstructed justice. -You're in trouble. -Gosh... -No... -Please go easy on us. -Do-kyung is crazy. -Gosh. -Don't say a thing. -We're in trouble. You useless punks! Do you think you're still teenagers? You little... I'll break your legs and lock you up. I'm going to die early because of you! Of all the things you've done, this is the craziest. I'll kill you when you get home! Hey! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You can keep her. Keep her. But... Just let him have her. But... Honey... How is it? Isn't it amazing? It's edible. Don't be like that. This is super expensive. Are you crazy? You're not supposed to eat pineapples when you're pregnant. Don't you know the basics? You'll be a mom soon. That's a misconception. A misconception or not, there's no harm in being careful. I want to go to your house, but I hear it's not good for people to go in and out where there's a pregnant person. You should research the internet. You should check what you can and cannot do. You have time now since you won't be drinking. What is she doing here? Hold on. What's going on? How can they be together? What's this? What happened? What's going on? Don't mind me and do what you have to do. I'm only here to eat. You must already know what he's like. I do. You can proceed. I looked in your phone. I was curious what you saved me as. "Darling" or just my name? It turns out it was Mon. I wondered what it stands for. Then I found Tue and Wed as well. Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, and Sat. Right. You didn't have a Sun. Is that your day off? How does it feel to see all of us at one time? I thought about how I should end it, and I didn't want to go easy. We decided to beat you up together. Were you serious? We can discuss this, can't we? Why are you doing this? This isn't right! Cuckoo Cuckoo Just go without touching it What's the point of getting your hands dirty? It's partially your fault for falling for him because of his job. -Why are you meddling? Ma'am, go away. -Mademoiselle. I'm not married. I'm Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri, Sat, and Sun. Sunday. He spends Sundays with me. We live together. -Are you married? -No. We're not married. Let me give you some advice, as your elder. Don't look at their faces, business cards, or money. You should meet men based on their personality. Oh, my. Forget it. One must have a good personality to recognize a good one. Go ahead. Keep judging people by their looks. Keep that up and keep meeting jerks like him. Good luck! Seriously... Come on. I'm scared. You fight like a chic. Take this! Thank you. You got rid of them in a split second. It's best for a woman to handle another woman. How am I going to set up my days of the week again? I'm sorry. Jin-sang. When I... think about your high school days, I remember you were so sweet. It was so sweet when you cried your eyes out after the principal died. When you were helping out that old man who collected paper to make a living, you were sweet. Even when you were studying with Do-kyung, you two would wait for me at the bus stop if I came home late. When I saw you guys at the bus stop, I thought you two were so sweet. I liked it. When I look back at that time, everything about you was so sweet. I don't know why you suddenly changed so much. Only you would. I'm sure something happened. Look, Jin-sang, you're actually a great guy. What's gotten into you? You're going to make me cry. Stop torturing yourself and find someone to marry that you really love. And... I hope you become the Minister of Justice. I won't tell the baby that you're the father. However, I want the baby's father to be someone great. No matter where he is. Someone the baby won't be embarrassed about. Crazy brat. What are they planning to do? Just let them be. We probably can't separate them even if we tried. Here is your chicken. Thank you. You don't do deliveries, right? No, I'm sorry. It's okay. If it's good, I'll get it. It's only a ten-minute walk from my place. Have a nice day. Thank you. Take care. I never dreamed I would help Do-kyung as a lawyer. What does he see in her? He's totally crazy about her. I was with her today, and she's loud. Super loud. He hates loud girls. I know. There must be something else that's super special. What is it? What is it about her? Ask him yourself. As if he would ever tell me. I told you not to drink from the bottle! My mouth is cleaner than yours. You asshole. Go get a cup. -Go get a cup. Go get it! -No. -Go get a cup! -No. Say it one more time. "Asshole"? He's older than you. How dare you kick him? And how dare you call him an "asshole"? What's wrong with you? We always fight like this! How dare you call him names. Would you like it if I called you names? Well? You jackass! He's 36. He'll be 40 soon. Will you still call him a dog then? Will you call him that when he's married with kids? You're saying that more than I did. You'd better treat Jin-sang with respect from now on. And you! Hoon is younger than you and he's being rude. Are you just going to laugh about it and let him mistreat you? There's a difference between being friendly and rude. If you thought he crossed the line, you should have warned him with a look or just by telling him. You need to earn respect from others. -Make sure you're treated properly. -What's with you? -You're making things awkward. -It makes me uncomfortable to see you two treat Jin-sang so badly. Stop it. You were the worst out of us all! I said, stop it! I... I think I get it. I think I get it now. What is it now? Tell me no. Tell me it's not true. Please! What are they doing? No, we never did it. You and I never did it! No. This is impossible! That dream... That dream! That's right. It was for the baby. -No. -You... -You jerk. You crazy bastard! -No, you have it all wrong. I don't know about this. Hold on. It's not me. This isn't right! Who should you pity here? Who's the pitiful one here? For the crime you committed by dating all those women, you're sentenced to life with Park Soo-kyung. You little... Hey! -Come here. -Hold him. Hey! -Do-kyung, get him. -No, hold on. Wait. You don't have the right to remain silent! -No! -Stay still. Will it be too hard? What do you think? Hae-young. Hae-young. Do-kyung. Hae-young. Do-kyung. Hae-young. Do-kyung. Hae-young. Yes, Do-kyung. Hae-young. Do-kyung. Hae-young. Yes, Do-kyung. Hae-young. I'm sorry. I know. I'm the craziest one right now. I'm not asking you to forgive him. I won't ask you to forgive me either. I'll take all the punishment I get. Wow. You completely made a fool of me. I'm sorry. Do-kyung. -Where are you going? -On a date. You must think I'm imprudent since I told you I love you many times. It's something I promised even before that. Sorry. I'm glad that you're going on dates. I'm running late. Okay, bye. See you soon. Let's have drinks with Hae-young sometime. Sure. A love that is as precious as your life might be the agonizing pain for someone else. However, I can't help it. My love is more important to me. Okay. Really? -You did well. -I did? This is so much fun. I'd like to call him and tell him that we're dating. -Hello. -Hello. My dad is the landlord of this place. I heard you were interested in buying it. Do you still want it? My father passed away. My father passed away. -Let's go and beg. -We've come a long way. -Does the woman who lived here... -You should see her. Which Hae-young do you think... It's boiling. That's hot. Oh, gosh! I burned my hand. Luckily, it's my left hand. I spilled the hot soy sauce while making jangjorim. I shouldn't do things I normally don't do. You didn't eat yet? Are you saying, people that get hurt or die don't change? What are we going to do?
