 3x01 - Back in Black Ok, I get what's going on here. I'm really glad to hear that, Rex. You can come out! I know you're there! - Rex? - We're friends, now. Remember? Breach? Breach isn't here, Rex. The world's changed. As soon you accept... No, I'm not ignoring you. It's just that you're not real. I assure you I'm very real -- as is all of this. [ chuckling ] Oh, come on. It's been a fun time in the old

 Breach cape, but, you know, time to go home now. Seen this before. Usually ends with a black hole. Rex, you're disoriented. Let me -- Sorry, non-lady. No time. Got an exit to find! Shall we aprehend? It won't be necessary. Rex! Have you lost it? Caesar! We're in a pocket dimension! It could collapse at any second! That's crazy, Rex. This is not a pocket dimension. You're right! It's a whole alternate universe! And -- and -- and you're my Brother's evil twin!

 Out of the way! Six! Six! Dr. Holiday! Doc! Wha-- Well, at least some things haven't changed. Whoa! Whoa! Okay, now I -- bleh-- know I'm in an -- aah! -- alternate universe. Unh! You can go ahead and -- bleh! -- Eat me now, please. Release. You were saying something about changes? There have been a few. You've got temporal lag, Rex. It's kind of like altitude sickness, only in time. Really. Welcome to the future, Rex -- Or, rather, to the present. Providence has embraced a new paradigm. We've moved beyond the outmoded era of "cure, contain, or kill." And into the era of "serious leash laws". We used the petting zoo as our test bed. What do you think? I think it needs a new name, 'cause, you know, now it really is one. We've developed new techniques for working with Evos. It's all about understanding them better. So, you're some sort of "evo whisperer"? You sure you're okay? It's good to have you back, brother. Family ties. They transcend even time itself. Caesar's not my only family. I'll bring you up to speed on the others. When you went M.I.A., White Knight lost his biggest weapon in the war for Evo containment. Figures that I have to vanish for him to appreciate me. White became erratic -- some might say paranoid. Directorate lost faith in his ability to lead. Directorate? I never knew white even had a boss. There are, shall we say, layers. I was named as his replacement. Let me guess -- he didn't take it well. You could say that. White knight! Sir! Stand down! I'd rather go down in flames than see Providence in the hands of the enemy. He's got a bomb! Fall back! All units fall ba-- Whoa! That was... ! Your room. Huh? Aww, man! But... Six... Holiday... where -- Where do you think? They're out looking fyou. Agent Six and Holiday took indefinite leave. They've been off the grid ever since. I've attempted to contact them, but no response. Mind if... I give them a ring? Not that I don't trust you. But you don't trust me. Natural, given the circumstances. Be my guest. It won't take long, to locate them. Meanwhile, there are many familiar faces who will be glad to hear you're back. Which reminds me... This is everything we salvaged from your room. Huh. Talk about starting over. You could you know. There's still a place for you in the -- My room. I thought you said it was trashed. Rex, wait. What's the matter, Black? This where you're hiding all your evil secrets? Um...W ow! This entire wing was destroyed in the blast. I had the space... repurposed. White wouldn't even splurge for private stalls. As you see, I treat my finest people to the very finest things. Sure. I'll take one of those, please. It's yours -- and anything else you'd like. As long as I do whatever you want -- that it? On the contrary -- you're a seasoned agent. I have a few boundaries, but otherwise, handle matters as you see fit. Say I refuse. Then I turn you over to mel. I'm kidding. You're free to leave whenever you like. But I hope you'll stay. Now, more than ever, Providence needs a Rex. So, how do you feel? Like I haven't used one of those in Six months -- which I haven't. You mind? Bobo? Rex! Heard you were back. So great to see you, buddy. Whoa. Just a sec, there, pal. Gotta love those certain towelettes. What? Never seen a monkey wash his hands before? Not this one... You wanna tell me what's gotten into you or what? What are you talking abou-- Unh! Hey! Sorry. For a minute, I thought you were... Robo Bobo? Wanna check for a tv in my butt? Pass. But come on. You've, I don't know, mellowed or something. Guess I just don't have a big need to act out these days, what with you and everyone gone. Plus, the employee benefits are pretty sweet. Black Knight: Rex, we've got a little Evo problem. Providence could use your help. Ready to get back in the game? If it involves getting out of here, that would be a "yes." You coming? I'll join ya on the next one. I got Tai Chi at 2:00. Missing an Evo smackdown? That doesn't sound like you. Did I mention the instructor has a thing for back hair? Ew. Okay. That sounds like you. What is it and where do I find it? We've got an evo in the subway tunnels, people trapped in one of the trains. The power's out down there, too. Sounds like a street worm. Sure it's just one? Rex to H.Q. Okay, new chief, how do you want to do this? You're the expert. I am? Uh, I mean, of course I am. It's just that Six usually -- You don't need help, Rex. Handle it as you see fit. Black, out. What's this strange feeling that's come upon me? Could it be... ...responsibility?! Okay. Assemble your guys over there. Be ready for me. Should the guys grab flashlight. or... better. Not a bad pre-show. Now for the main event. How did you know? These things usually travel in pairs. I used lights from my builds to make it think I was another worm. Have your bug net handy. They're so cute after I shut them down. Sorry B.K. No can cure. Understood. Our team will take it from here. Um, take what where? Move into the vehicle! Move into the vehicle! Hit her again. What just happend? Black Knight: That's all for now, Rex. Nicely done. Wait. What are you gonna do with it? Standard rehab and re-lo. It's all very humane. I'd love to see that. Mind if I tag along? Sorry, Rex. Authorized personnel only. You've done your job. Now let the team theirs. But -- Boundaries, Rex. Boundaries. Got it. Rex, out. Main container reached. Attach stabilizer ring. Humane? Yeah, right. See? Great employee benefits. Yeah. Right. Hey, you got a tag sticking out in the back. Mind if I... Thanks, pal. Well, off to yoga. You really shouldn't be here, hermano. The petting zoo? The worm? My monkey practicing good hygiene? You're using that thing to control my friend! He's still the same Bobo you know and love. He just needed a few boundaries. He's not the same, and neither are you! You should hear yourself! Making the world safer isn't possible without some form of control. And you'd better get some control of yourself, mijo. Or what? You'll use that thing on me? Open your eyes to all the good we're accomplishing. Isn't this better than smacking them with your giant fists? That's combat! I protect people and property! Okay, property not so much, but this? If you can't see the difference, Then maybe I never knew you at all. It doesn't matter. I have work to do. So do I. Rex! Stop! Snooping around, Rex? See, that's another one of my boundaries. White knight may have had his issues, but he never resorted to anything like this. I never planned to do this, Rex, but you've become a danger. Caesar! Think! You can't do this! Of course I'm thinking. This is the logical conclusion to what we started. The logical -- Aaaah! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Raaah! Aah! Sorry, Rex. You'll thank me later. You... better... believe I will! Please don't resist! It's only painful if you struggle! Black Knight: What's taking so long? He's fighting it. His nanitic energy is spiking off the scale. Boost power. It's not safe to -- It's for the best. You just drew a line in the sand, bro. You better have a backup. The prototype. Not portable, but more than enough power, even for him. Get it ready. No mood to get slimed right now, mel! What happened to your Evo control? A demonstration. You know what would happen without our influence. So, you're hijacking its brain, like you tried to do with mine. That won't be necessary if you'll willingly cooperate. Translation -- if I do everything you say. You've seen how we can work together. Providence still needs you. There will always be a few Evos we can't control. Yeah. I'm one of them. - Shall we pursuit? - Most definitally. Gangway! Coming through! Huh? No! Black punks! Overdoing the whole theme, don't you think? I'm getting beat up by the chess club! We... got off on the wrong foot. Stow the hardware and come with us. You have my word you won't be harmed. We can start over -- the right way. Do you mind? You're interrupting the enjoyment of my employee benefits. Excellent work. Take him to the lab. What? No way! You're not turning my brain to mashed potatoes! Doc? Welcome back, Rex. Good to see you, kid. Before I blame this on a Burrito-induced nightmare, will someone please tell me -- What... Is... Going... On?! What do you think? We've been looking for you. We knew Providence might find you first. Fortunately, we planted a mole. [ toilet flushes ] Rex! Put 'er there! Uhh! You didn't wash! Oh! You didn't wash! But that means... that he really was... Robo Bobo? In the flesh. Literally. I gave it a biological upgrade, complete with his own nanites and... fleas, ticks, lice, chigger mites. What can I say? I'm an ecosystem. It's enough to fool your brother's equipment. The robot is only providing limited intel. But one thing is sure -- new Providence is about more than just getting Evos off the streets. I saw it. Whatever they're doing over there is seriously messed up. That's why we've set up our own operation. Whoa! Where did you get all this? We have our sources. So, we're like super-secret spies now? Cool! It's too bad about White, though. I never thought I'd say it, but I'm gonna miss that pasty guy. How touching, Rex. I, on the other hand, have rather enjoyed the last six Rex-free months. Now... if we're done with the love-in, we have work to do. It really can't get any better than this. Oh, except one thing -- can I get a tv?
