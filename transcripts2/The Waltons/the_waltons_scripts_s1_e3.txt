 Walton's Mountain was an everlasting presence in our lives. Whenever I could, when I was growing up there during the Depression years I would climb its slopes. Up there I could get lost in dreams dreams of becoming a writer, of becoming a man. I knew no writers, so I had no writer to model myself after but as a boy aspiring to manhood I had only to follow in the footsteps

 of a remarkable father. $1.75 to the electric company? Liv, we've got to start turning off some lights around here. We'll have to start eating dinner by candlelight. It's more romantic anyhow. Eating a meal you can hardly see is not my idea of romance, girl. -What else we got there? -$12 insurance. -What does that leave us? -You really want to know? Just give it to me in round numbers. It's nothing to crow about, but I guess we'll get by. I better take this for the money orders. What's going on out there? Kids are catching lightning bugs. Is it that timeof year already?

 Yard's full of them. Tiny little lanterns rising up from the grass. You know, it's been years since I ran a yard chasing lightning bugs. We getting old, Liv? Do you feel like your getting old? Sometimes I don't know how I feel. -Good night, Mama, Daddy. -Good night, Daddy. Just a minute, you two. Come on down here. What's this going to bed with the chickens? -We're getting up early. -At the crack of dawn. What's on the schedule for the crack of dawn?  -Due any day now. -Tomorrow for sure. -Okay. Good night, sweetie. -Good night, honey. -Good night, Jim-Bob. -I'm too old for that stuff. -Good night, Jim-Bob. -Good night, Mama. Sure hope it's a heifer. We could use another milk cow around here. Come on. Let's go outside and catch lightning bugs. What did he mean, I'm getting to old for that now? He means that he doesn't take after his father. All right. Let's go get us some lightning bugs. Chance? She's run away. Morning. You all hurry up with that coffee. Will you, Grandma? -I have got a chill in my bones. -But it's spring, Grandpa. Oh, you. I've still got a chill in my bones. Does that mean he's getting old? It does mean he's getting grumpy. Grandpa grunts and groans. I had a chill in my bones linger clear on through July. Winters. They do seem to be running closer together. Now that means he's getting old. Thank you, Livie. I'm not slaving over these flapjacks to have you run out. Now sit! Maybe she went off to have her baby. John. John-Boy. She's all right, just wandered off. Sit down, have your breakfast. You too, Jim-Bob. The youngest one here is right. She's going to have the calf in the brush. Indian squaws used to do that. And they come through all right. And so will our cow. The Good Lord sees to that. John! John-Boy! -Good morning. -Morning. Morning. Gonna have her baby in the brush, Daddy. -Who? -The cow's gone. Chance. When they're having their young, they want to be alone. She'll be fine. Maybe we'd better take a look. Come on, John-Boy. Now, don't you two be long. Hurry up, finish your breakfast and get ready for school. -But, Mama, Chance. -They'll find Chance, now eat. All this fuss about one old cow. I wish I got that kind of attention around here. Oh, hush, dear. Here, here, Chance, here. I've got to get up on the mountain, and you've got to get to school. I know. -You think it'll rain, Mama? -Look at that sun. You'll have to search to find a cloud. Poor Chance. Didn't even want to have her calf at home. -Maybe she wanted privacy. -Well, no need to worry. Cows have their calves in the field all the time. But Chance just isn't any cow. She's used to her own stall and warm straw. Would you supposeif I ever wandered off myself, anyone would ever take notice? Grandpa... despite the fact that you don't give milk or have baby calves we'd turn every stone. Your mama's right. We'll find her. I'll have a look for the old milk wagon myself. Now go on to school. -Any sign of her? -No, but she'll turn up. Thanks, John-Boy. There's work to be done. Livie, bring my lunch. Come on. Off to school you go. Good bye. I just won't be able to concentrate, Daddy, You try, Ben. Here. You haven't had breakfast. I must get to the mountain. You coming, Pa? No, I promised the young'uns that I'll help look for the cow. There's plenty of work anyway out at the old sawmill. I'll see you tonight. Don't wear yourself out, Pa. She'll come back when she is ready. Don't you wander off too far. You hear, old man? -Been gone a while. -Stubborn old man. Thank God for the Walton stubbornness, Grandma. It's kept us going. and then complaining that there's work to be done and then goes off looking. Oh, dear God. Now you got yourself a boy. Congratulations. You might have got yourself born a little closer to home. I've got to get you two on back. They'll be worrying about the three of us now. Livie. -Boy or girl, Grandpa? -It's a bull. I was hoping for a heifer. We could use another milk cow. Now, don't you take it personally, Chance. Hey, there you are. -How come you're walking? -Truck broke down. -You gonna be able to use it? -Not for a while. -Where is everybody? -Everybody is in the barn. Come on, come on. Come on! -Grandpa found them. -She sure is a beauty. -She's a he. -You didn't get a heifer, John. I thought I'd seen the last birth in this family. All right, you kids, now don't get too close. Cows get kind of feisty with a young'un. Elizabeth, get out of there. Come on, you two, out. Give the calf a rest. Out. Come on, all of you. Jason, pass the cheese. Mama, can I take the calf for a walk tomorrow? He's not a dog, silly. Erin. Sure lucky you stayed home today, Grandpa. Lucky to find them. Little feller couldn't have been more than an hour old when I came up on them. Well, next time I'd like to take a walk you better not be tired. What about tomorrow? Little picnic in the tall grass, barefoot like we used to. -What will we call him? -Little Chance. -No. -What about Friday? It's Friday. That's what Robinson Crusoe named his native friend -'cause it was on a Friday. -No. He's a bull. Let's name him Bullet. There's no use giving him a name. -The calf's not going to stay. -But why, Daddy? Because he's a bull. If it were a heifer, one day it'd give milk. Earn its keep. -Being a bull, he'd be useless. -He could be a pet, Daddy. A mighty expensive pet, son. Gonna sell him. We need the money he'll bring. But it's like selling a member of the family. You know, I... broke an axle on the truck today. What happened? Going up the mountain, hit a chuckhole, snapped that axle. It's gonna cost money to fix that truck. The calf will bring it. We live by the lumber we cut. Railroad ties, firewood. No truck, there'd be no money coming in. Please, Daddy. I'm sorry. That's final. 195 00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,185 Anybody wanna join me? -Please, Mama. -I'm sorry, sweetheart. But what your father says is rule in this house. Livie, what's wrong? I don't know. Wish we didn't have to sell that calf. Our kids aren't like farm-raised children. To farm-raised kids it's like stock raised to be slaughtered. But to our kids, it's like a member of the family. You know how they adopt any baby thing. I know where they get that from. All right. I have my faults, but you're stuck with me. I never argue with a redheaded woman. Then you'll let the calf stay? No, we can't. If the kids get any more used to it, it'll be like getting rid of the family dog. Besides, we need to have the money. I've already ordered a new axle. -How much will it cost? -$9. -The calf would bring that? -Should. I'm sorry, honey, but the kids need to know the facts of life. You're right. The sooner it goes, the better. I'll start asking around tomorrow. 220 -Good night, Mary Ellen. -Good night, John-Boy. -Good night, Jason. -Good night, Mary Ellen. -Good night, Erin. -Good night, Jason. -Good night, Ben. -Good night, Erin. -Good night, Mama. -Good night, Ben. -Good night, Jim-Bob. -Good night, Mama. Good night, Daddy. Good night, Jim-Bob. Good night. -Can't wait to walk him. -Yeah. Just like another dog. I'd sure hate to be you right now. Wait until we can walk him. -He's pretty. -Cute. What's wrong? I sold the calf. -Who to, Daddy? -George Anderson. Just down the road a ways. You can visit him anytime you want. -It's not the same, Daddy. -He won't be ours no more. Daddy's already explained to us just why it's got to be done. So let's not make it any tougher than it is now. All right? -When's he going? -Tomorrow morning. John-Boy, let's get washed up. Thank you, son. -Give you $7.-I need $9. Everyone wants more. That water pump stopped working. Fellow come up from town to fix it, wanted five dollars. Wouldn't pay it. -$8. -Sorry. Taking him off you, what good's he to me? Use him for bull service. $9. Too much. You agreed to it yesterday. I didn't see him yesterday. He's puny. He'll fatten up. $8. Yeah, well... -Guess I'll get on into town. -All right. All right. $9. And I guess that means the pump will have to wait. Times is hard. So let us ask again. Have we reached the goal of our vision? Have we found our happy valley? I see a great nation upon a great continent blessed with a great wealth of natural resources. Its 130 million people are at peace among themselves they are making their country a good neighbor among the nations. What's all this bawling, girl? You need someone to talk to? Come here now. Bullet's not that far away. He's at Anderson's farm. Just wanna tell you, we love you, Chance, and we understand about it. You just go to sleep. Quit crying. Get a good night's sleep. -I can't sleep, Mama. -Try to read for a while. Elizabeth's crying. I'll see to her in a minute. You go on upstairs now. Good night. Liv. We've never gone to sleep with a cross word between us. Let's not start now. I'm not cross. It's just that she sounds so human. John, how do we knowhow she feels? Chance will get over it. Poor Chance. Poor Mama. It's been three days. It's telling on her. If I only had a few dollars, I'd buy her. Old man daydreaming. Remember when the children used to beg to lick the icing? Now I can't get any kind of a rise out of them. -I thought it'd pass. -John thought it would, too. And that doesn't help. What are we gonna do? I got $3. $2.38. That quilt I finished summer before last. Miss Emily offered me $5 for it.  Five and five. That's $10. And we only need $9. But that quilt is like part of the family. So is Chance. If it'll help get this house back to the way it was it'll be worth it. Now what's going on here? John-Boy... last summer Miss Emily offered me $5 for this. Grandma. Put out your hands. Come on. -There's $4. $5 for this quilt. -Mama, that's your memory quilt. Just sewed up from scraps, son. Now, you take it and sell it. Mama, you treasure this quilt. Everything here is a part of us. There's scraps of Mary Ellen's baptism dress and there's a scrap of the shirt that Jim-Bob wore to-- Take it. What do you think Daddy's going to say? I figure he'll have a lot to say. Your daddy and me, we have a way of talking things out. Are you sure about that, girl? I can always make another quilt. Now go. Hi, Bullet. Hey, son, how are you? -Mr. Anderson. -John-Boy. -Fair weather. -Yes, it is. The calf's growing like a weed, isn't he? Eats enough. I'll tell you, Mr. Anderson, that's why I'm here. The family, we've been thinking about it. We decided we made a mistake. -Mistake? -Yes, sir. By selling the calf. See, the kids are mighty fond of it, and we got to pondering and we decided, we'd like to back it back from you. We got your... $9 right here, every penny. 346 Isn't it just what you paid for it? To start with. Since then I have invested in that critter. Feed, fixed a pen to hold him. $12 and you can have him back. $12? I'll tell you, this is just about all we could come up with at the moment. $3 more and he's yours. Hi, folks. Coffee? Yeah, that'll be fine. -Where are the kids? -Doing homework. Did John-Boy come in? Is he upstairs? -He's at the Anderson place. -There and gone. I-I sent himto buy the calf back. -But how.... -I had a few dollars. It was my doing. That quilt I finished a couple of summers ago. I sold it. Listening to Chance grieving, I... I just know she feels the same way I'd feel if I lost mine. It'll be good to get a night's sleep. -He wouldn't take $9. -What? He wants $12. Says he's made an investment. Why that tightfisted, pinched-faced-- Now wait a minute, Pa. It's his calf. I'm afraid that's just too much, son. Well, look here. 375 00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:40,366 Mr. Anderson will take real good care of him. You just should've see him. He was fat and sassy like a possum. Can we go play with him? Of course. How about tomorrow after school? -Can we take him a present? -Sure. I saw a look on Daddy's face today. And all of a sudden, I found myself looking at him not as my daddy, but as another man. Maybe I'm growing up a little, maybe it was the pain. It came to me that for all the pleasure Mama and Daddy find in us childrenthere are other times that are heartbreaking. I'm gonna to try to be of more help around here. I'm gonna speak to the other children, too, tell them to show a little appreciation. -Hi, Bullet. -Hi. Brought you a present. -Kind of big. -He'll grow into it. That's so folks can find you if you get lost. Daddy's right. Mr. Anderson's will take good care of you. -Wish he was living with us. -Yeah. Hey, you kids. He ain't gonna need it. -Suppose he runs away? -Won't happen. How come you're so sure, Mr. Anderson? You're gonna have to know sooner or later. Gets a little bigger, calves got to be slaughtered for beef. Livie, go on in and sit down and have your supper. John and John-Boy will find those young scamps. They're out playing somewhere. Young'uns have a way of losing track of time. No sign of them. -John-Boy back yet?-No, John. It's past 7:00, and the night's getting a chill to it. Where are you going, Pa? I'm going out to look around for them. I know these mountains like the back of my hands. No, you won't, old man. You'll catch a chill. Evening, John. Evening, Ep. Sheriff, go ahead. Take a look in the barn. Mr. Anderson, I asked you to let me handle this. -What's the problem? -Well, Anderson here claims... that a couple of your children stole his calf. -That's-that's hogwash! -That's what I told him, Livie. But Anderson swears that he saw your two youngest on his property this afternoon. None of my children would steal. I know, but it's my job to clear this whole thing up. Now, I know the young ones like Jim-Bob and Elizabeth are probably in bed by this time, but I'd like to speak to them, if I may. Sheriff, Jim-Bob and Elizabeth are.... They're not here, Ep. Where are they? They never came home from school. You see that? John-Boy's out looking for them now. John, when they do turn up, I'll have to talk to them. I understand. I couldn't find them. Just come from your place, Mr. Anderson. Then you know my calf's gone. Yes, I know that, sir. I know Jim-Bob and Elizabeth wouldn't have stolen it. I contend they did. Now, Anderson, you're making big charges against my children. I don't believe in mollycoddling kids. -I told them the truth. -What truth is that?  Once he's big enough. I thought you were going to breed him. Changed my mind. My calf. He's right, John. You told them you were gonna slaughter him? Yes, I did. Those kids are very fond of that calf, Anderson. They didn't take it to steal it, they were saving its life. I don't care. If I don't get him back-- You'll have him back by morning. All right, that's good enough for me. You need any help, John? No, thanks, Ep. Let me go get Reckless. He's got their scent. -Get two lanterns, too, son. -Yes. John, where could they have gone? Honey, they're not far. We'll find them. I'm scared, Jim-Bob. Just stay close to me. It's not far. Where's this bear's cave? Not bear's cave. Bryant's cave. Don't worry I've been there. -When? -Last summer. John-Boy used to come and write in his pad there. Don't worry, the calf will be safe. Reckless! 474 00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:36,021 And the calf's. Wonder where they're going? They don't know. They're just trying save the calf. Jim-Bob, I'm scared. Nothing to be scared of. We got light. But John-Boy's candle isn't going to last long. He won't need it. He don't come here to write anymore. Aren't you finished with Bullet's nest yet? Almost. We'll come back to feed him every day. But it's so far. What are we going to tell Mama and Daddy? I'll think of something. No, Daddy'll make us give him back. Let's hurry. I'm cold. Okay, we'll be back. He'll be safe inside when this is covered up. Daddy, I think I know where they could've gone. Where? Bryant's cave. I used to write there, and I took Jim-Bob once. Let's go. Jim-Bob, what's wrong? I'm lost. We didn't come this way before. It's too dark to see anything. What are we going to do? It's a wolf! There aren't any wolves, silly. Now stop it. Come on, let's go back to the cave. Mama's going to be worried to death. Let's go. -Reckless! -Oh, Reckless. Come on out here. You all right? Yeah. Where's the calf? Mr. Anderson was going to kill him. I know. Mr. Anderson was at the house. -Where is he? -In the cave. John-Boy, why don't you go get him. -We'll start on home. -All righty. We going to get a spanking? Run off like that. You got the whole family worried. Causing all this trouble. What do you think? He was going to die, Daddy. Come on, let's go home. Reckless, come on. Reckon you got a soup bone coming. Had a bath and some food. Poor things, they're exhausted. And afraid. They asked me if I was going to give them a spanking. They're still worrying. John, what they did...to them it was the right thing. The only thing. Don't start mother-henning them. They did wrong and they must realize it. way they live the rest of their lives. What's wrong, what's right. I know why they did it. There's not going to be any spanking. Not tonight. Jim-Bob! Elizabeth! I know how...you and your brothers and sisters feel about that calf. But when you took him and ran off the way you did, you did two things wrong. First, you took something that didn't belong to you. And second, you worried your ma and the rest of us.  what was going to happen to that calf but you should've thought about the rest of us. How much we love you. How much we worry about you. What else could we do? You could've come to me. We could've talked. Maybe we could've worked something out together. Next time there's a problem, let's talk. We're sorry, Daddy. We didn't mean to worry you. It's been a long day. Way past bedtime. There you go, sweetie. Daddy, is the calfstill going to die? No, honey. The calf's not going to die. That's still the Anderson's calf. I just wanted them to have a good night's sleep. They'll sleep. But you won't. Who're you fooling, Livie Walton? I'll have company. You know, Jim-Bob was telling the young ones that calf is going to live a long, fat, and sassy life. You think Anderson's gonna go along with that? I've been thinking about that all night. Come up with any answers? I was just starting over to your place, Mr. Anderson. I see Jim-Bob and Elizabeth made it all right. Sheriff, talk to those kids. My son has already talked to them. -I'll take the calf and leave. -Mr. Anderson... just a minute. To you this calf is just meat on the table but to my children, he's become a part of the family. Take the $9. I already told your son I wanted $12. But I got a proposition for you. I'm glad you're here, Sheriff. You can be witness. I've always taught my kids they have to earn what they want. They want this calf, and they're gonna have to earn it. Now, I'm willing, if you're willing. Why should I? Go ahead, John. There's a lot of repairs to be done at your place. Chores. Errands. My boys will work for you. Make up the difference between the 9 and 12 dollars. How do I know I can count on that? -My boy is giving you his word. -I'd lay money on it. Look here, Anderson, you've been griping how much help has been costing you.  Now, what do you say? Have them at my place after school. -Twenty cents a day. -Fine. Meantime, I'll just keep the calf... till he's paid for in full. Good, you might as well feed him. That's all right. You might as well hold on to him. That's real generous of you, Anderson. -Isn't it, John? -Sure is. When are they getting started? Tomorrow, Mr. Anderson. Right after school. -Much obliged, Sheriff. -Don't mention it.  Yes, sir, Daddy. It was a fine thing to know such people, and to be one of them. And to share in their abundant love. It was a poor time, but in it we were richer than we knew. Forty years have passed but the voices from that house are as fresh as yesterday. -Mama? -Yes, Elizabeth? -You asleep? -Almost. Reckon Chance is asleep? Wouldn't surprise me. -Good night, Mama. -Good night, Elizabeth.
