 The girl has been placed here for us to see. She's been put on display. Locally anesthetized, maybe. Local anesthetics prevent bleeding. There's limited bleeding. Does that help us? -You never told me what we're looking for. -We're looking for the mother. We found the father, he's out of town. Nobody knows where the mother is. Is she a suspect? The mother didn't do it. Kari says it's not the mother. He could tell us what we're looking for. We've gone through the whole place.

 -Heikkinen wants to know what... -I know what he wants. But I want to do my own work in peace. -There's nothing here. -Sorjonen says there is. The mother has dark hair. In the drawings on the wall there's a blonde. I have an idea about who did this. Yeah? The girl's mother. -You just said it's not the mother. -Not that mother. Is there an attic? The attic! Go to the attic! She sees nothing, hears nothing, says nothing. What? This girl is adopted.

 Her biological mother is here now. The blonde. Maybe a nanny. An au pair. A cleaning woman. She wanted to be near her own child. The girl found out. Now the girl will certainly see nothing, hear nothing, and say nothing. -She wants to show to the adoptive mother. -Nothing here. She wants to share this. She's still here. There's nothing here! She has a hiding place. There's another room! Heikkinen! Move that stuff aside. Tell Sorjonen he better not come up here. We found the perpetrator. Sorjonen doesn't need to go up there. Find out if she's studied medicine. This wasn't the first time she stitched on skin. Kari? It's highly likely she has studied it. Are you okay? If I'm not needed right now, I would like to leave. Going home for Christmas? -Hi. -Hi. -You're still here. -I promised her I'd stay on Christmas Eve. Hi. -You made it. -Yeah. There's coffee and tea in the machine downstairs. -For you? -No, for you. I'm good. That was a polite way of telling you that I'd like a moment alone with your mother. Why couldn't you just say so? What? Thanks. Has something happened? When I drove here I was thinking about... that change of scenery we've talked about. What if we moved? To mom's old house? What do you think Janina would say? Hard to say. Not just for you, but... for all of us. For the whole family. You'll have to ask Janina. Pauliina could give us a guided tour of the city someday. -We've been there many times. -But it's never been our home town before. -Pauliina? -Yeah. -I worked as a guide there in my teens. -There you have it. Top that if you can. Have I ever told you that you look a lot like my daughter? She's just a bit younger than you. Yeah. Every time we meet. Oh? There are two of you tonight. Valentina is coming, too. You'll stay the night. -Valentina? -Yep. I wouldn't be here if Valentina hadn't told me about this. She swore this would be easy. Any worries? I'll sit here until you fall asleep, okay? Hi. Did I forget something? We should celebrate your first day at work. -Celebrate how? -Good food, wine. I'll take care of it. -At six. -At six. See you then. -Have a nice day at work. -You too. SECRI SERIOUS CRIME UNIT Daniel Tammet. He has a rare condition that enables him to make complex calculations in his head. He speaks eleven languages and he invented a new one just for fun. Sometimes a defect is an asset. Tammet has developed memory techniques. Taina. These techniques can also work for us ordinary people. I'll show you. I asked Taina to collect material on you. Random pictures and files. Have I seen any of these before, Taina? Not unless you've hacked the files. Anyway, this is the sort of stuff your boss has on you. Niko, start the slide show. I'm a hollow man In the desert I want to get saturated by the rain There's music and everything. My friend told me that he's not right in the head. Music can be used as a memory aid. In theory, at least. Pause it, no one is listening. The background is much more interesting. Logically thinking, what do you think should happen now? That you tell us how to solve crimes using that trick. Johanna Metso. Congratulations, you turned 36 last week. Divorced. No children, a big plus for your career. Your boss won't say that out loud. You've applied for a job in the new unit. Taina chose six, no seven pictures of you. You in that lovely dress at a party. That's three more than of you, Niko Kristian Uusitalo. Johanna likes target practice and field work, right? Whereas Niko prefers a desk job. You're the indoors type, aren't you? Is it because of your parents? Father in the Department of the Interior, mother in the high court. Police work a mere stepping stone for a civil service career? We agreed to select the most qualified applicants for the Serious Crime Unit together. Have you decided already? Memory mansion. I decided beforehand to focus my attention to a few areas. This helps me remember them. Then I piece together bits of information between the rooms and interpret. And so I claim that Taina has chosen Niko and Johanna without consulting me. I can't decide before we discuss it. -But is your mind made up? -I have front-runners. If I concur, would these two be our candidates? Yes. Crime prevention is an important task. That's why we need to be able to interpret forensic material. A few pictures, a few reports. Two minutes, interpretation. A skill we can all learn. What was that about? Nothing personal. You get approval by challenging the authority of the leader. Why do you want to be here? -Besides what I said in my application? -Yes. I want to have dinner with my family every day. -It might be more realistic here. -You think so? Isn't this a town of cozy crime? After I recruited you, I started hearing rumors. Are they true? That you messed up at the NBI and this is your way out? Johanna Metso tries to be something she's not. Tougher, better than she is. Niko Uusitalo is a brown nose. Are they the best fit for my new team? You can question my authority out there, but not here with me. I read your resume. I spoke with a colleague of yours, Heikkinen. It puzzles me how we've managed to lure a top investigator to Lappeenranta. It's personal. Well, if it stays that way... Welcome to the Serious Crime Unit. Where are we going? Don't worry, you'll be fine. You missed the St. Petersburg junction. It's okay. Esa... Take me home! -Don't you worry. -No, Esa, take me home! Just let me think. It's okay. I'll take care of everything. It's okay. Sleep tight, Katia. I know I'm late, Pauliina, but what color is our house these days? How can you remember so much and yet forget something this important? It's not a matter of will. I'm passionate about work. That stuff occupies my mind no matter what. This stuff is more important to me. It takes more effort. You're saying that you can't remember things that are important to you? Sort of. I forgot something, too. I need money for schoolbooks. Didn't I give you a book store credit card? Yes, but there aren't any of those book stores around here. I propose a toast. Cheers. Won't you answer it? We're having dinner together like we agreed. New town, new job, new routines... -Just answer it. -Okay. Sorjonen. Saimaanharju? Where's that? -Any external injuries? -No visual trauma. Went skinny dipping and drowned? -Were you the first one on the scene? -Yes, I was on duty. Kari! -Where are you going, Sorjonen? -Home. We're in the middle of an investigation here! -This is no crime scene. -Is that a fact? The girl was already dead when she was dumped from the boat. Probably stripped naked before, nobody undresses a corpse. Lungs filled with air, naked, the girl was left floating. The wind brought her to the shore. You can see the wind direction in the trees. The people on that boat spotted the body and called the police. Had they seen the other boat, we'd be looking for that. Johanna went out into the water to retrieve the body. She's on duty. So, I'll be at the post-mortem. There's no reason for me to stay here and catch a cold. Niko, let's go. Are you okay? I'm not a fan of dead people. But then again, who is? Open up! Where's the money? Let me the fuck out! Where are you getting your money from? Where are you getting your money, Katia? Are you in trouble? Katia. Look. I made this smaller, in case you get cold. I'll get you something better later. I'll untie you if you promise to be good. Promise? Here. No! I'll let you get changed in private. Esa. I just wanted to call my mother, she's worried. I should have been home by now. Good. Good. I'm just trying to help you. I'll take better care of you than your mom. I promise. Change into the boilersuit. Give me a shout when you're ready. I'll be outside. Katia, we just have to dance and flirt with them. We will meet rich men, good men, handsome men. Then we get all kinds of things. Matias buys us new clothes. I won't take my clothes off or kiss anyone. Listen to me. Speak with Matias. He'll tell you how it works. -You found your way home this time. -Well, if you're Pauliina, I did. You have to come up with a mnemonic. I have one, actually. There's a mark on the areola of your left breast. -I'll take a look, okay? -Cut it out. Janina promised to schedule her hobbies so we could have dinner together... if that ever works out. I'm sorry... Why do I keep apologizing? I promise... I'll try to make sure it won't happen again. I don't suppose it will, not out here away from everything. Do you want to talk about it? No crime talk at home. No. Did Janina mention hobbies already? I think she's trying to figure out how to make new friends. Your daughter is quite smart, sometimes. Your daughter is smart. My daughter is a little peculiar. I'm going to sleep now. Lena. Andrei... Hello. What am I doing here at three in the morning? It's personal. It has to do with Katia. Thanks. I made a phone call. And I found an address. Don't you want to leave this to our colleagues across the border? As I said, it's personal. -Esa Kuparinen. -A car dealer. Travels between St. Petersburg and Lappeenranta on a weekly basis. Return it in one piece. Don't worry. I... I know you. Go get your daughter, then go back to work. I can keep quiet for a day or two. Doesn't an MRI focus on the insides of your head? Will you check them for me? Are you meeting with the mayor today? Taina said... Degerman considers our unit his own achievement. Why do you ask? -I'd like you to be at the hospital. -I will be. Thanks. You don't have to. I know I don't have to, but I want to. You lied to your mother about going out and finding new hobbies. -What did she say? -She believed you. It was a nice gesture, trying to cheer her up. Why don't you try to find something fun to do for real? I'm just trying to look ahead for all of our sakes. Looking back is your thing. You know I'm not good at asking. -It's easier for me to interpret, to... -That's not true. You do it because playing games is easier for you than being present. It was supposed to change, but you came home at a quarter past one. Okay, you're right. That's why we moved here. For that to change. But I'm trying, though poorly, to ask you why you moved here? I've got enough friends with divorced parents. Are you going to change your habits or not? Well, today I'm taking time off from work to go with your mom to the doctor. Good. Fucking great. Wait here. I'll check with them before I show you in. -What's the name of the new guy? -Kari Sorjonen. -Taina hired him? -Yes. Apparently he was forced to leave the NBI. Well, find out why he had to leave. Pauliina Rajala is his wife. -Sorjonen is Pauliina Rajala's husband? -Pauliina Sorjonen, nowadays. Okay. Bring him in. Jacket. In a way, it symbolizes the whole town. Everybody can see each other. Everybody knows one another. The new unit may only be a temporary project with the EU and Europol... but the entire city is heavily invested in this project, too. Which means that everybody... even Anneli's unborn baby, are ready to chip in for the new unit. Have you been able to start work yet? Our first case washed up on the shore last night. Good. I mean, it's good that you're here. We don't know yet if this case will be assigned to the new unit. Anyway, welcome to your whole family. -Do you have children? -A daughter. -Age? -Seventeen. Seventeen. Welcome to you all. Lappeenranta is a wonderful place, I'm sure you'll like it. Anneli and the guy who kept fiddling with his phone... -Mikkis Ahola. Mikael. City treasurer. -They are expecting? -Mikkis is Anneli's husband. -And Anneli is Robert's younger sister. How did you know? We're expected at the morgue. What does Robert Degerman have to do with my wife? No idea. -Are you going to St. Petersburg? -I'm not sure yet. If the negotiations go well I'm going, but I'll drive back tonight. Pass me the paper roll. Is this yours? I found it in the car. A client left it there. I'll return it. Take care of mommy. If you're a good girl and if there are no tantrums all day, I'll buy you that game. Neither her fingerprints nor her picture have led us to her identity yet. Her estimated age is between 15 and 20. Niko and Johanna checked all cottages and boats in the area. Nobody has seen anything. Not used to the smell? Clean skin. A couple of miniscule bruises. Like she's hit her leg against something. She's been dead for about 10-15 hours. The signs point to the heart. I've only found one thing, one millimeter in size. Kari. Drug addict? Doesn't look like the type if you ask me. Too clean? -Figo. -A fig? What are you talking about? Okay. I know no one reads Shakespeare any more. Figo! A Spanish poisoned fig. Delicious on the outside, poisonous on the inside. -Strangely enough no one has taken a bite. -Speak Finnish, HP! The girl is a virgin. Drug addict, virgin... the clothes she was in when she was found. It's a puzzle. I'm just the medical examiner, after all. Did she poison herself or was she poisoned? I did a toxicological screening, but the results are from the 80s, as is all of my equipment. -Any idea about the substance? -I sent samples to the university. To a chemistry professor, Lasse Maasalo. Well? Did these occur before or after death? They tend to get darker when they get older, but lividity can do the same. Why? It's been less than 24 hours so it figures that no one has reported her as missing. Shouldn't the criminal police handle this? Kari? If I wanted to submerge a body, what would I need? Dead bodies float. If we find the deepest point and start digging, I bet we'll find restraints of some sort and a weight. How much? How much do you bet? -Don't start a bet! -Fifty? I'm a cop and I don't have a rich family. Dragging the lake is expensive. This case does belong to SECRI. We'll pay. Niko just contributed with fifty euros. I wouldn't want to keep you here against your will. I have a family. But they paid me really well for the driving. And I can't let anyone reveal what I've done. Understood? We're in the same situation. I won't tell anyone. Take me home. Don't be afraid, I'm just going to give you a wash. What's that? A bollard. It weighs around 20 kilos. -Susi. -Sorjonen. -From what size boat? -This one belongs to a big vessel. It could have come from anywhere. Usually things come from where they are easily available. Where's the nearest ship harbor? Hotel Saimaanranta. Holiday Village Saimaanharju. -How far is it from here? -I'd say it's about... God dammit... How long is the drive from here to the hospital? -About half an hour. -God dammit. We will focus on Saimaanranta. Is the victim connected to Saimaanranta? Is it possible she would be? I don't want there to be even a remote connection to the project. -Is that a problem? -Sorjonen is. -Is Sorjonen interested in Saimaanranta? -Not yet. But he's good. He's every bit as good as they say he is. God dammit. Lie absolutely still for about five to eight minutes. The machine will make noise during that time. Here's the alarm button. If you press it we'll pull you out slowly and stop the scan. Hello? Yoo-hoo? Excuse me. My wife, Pauliina Sorjonen, where can I find her? Would you like a sedative? I don't know what came over me. I'm usually fine with this. Five, three, four. Okay, thanks Lasse. You were wrong. Not an insulin shot but methitural, a short-acting anesthetic. So the girl was anesthetized? According to Lasse Maasalo, the opiate is a precision anesthetic. It's normally stabilized with sodium carbonates, this time with something else. What exactly? Gösta Liljeqvist's contact information. He's a dental surgeon. His wife needed pain killers before she died, and Gösta helped her sleep. Gösta knows everything about anesthetics. The trick is to get the dose just right. In order to succeed you have to know the patient. Or what do you call them? Victim. To know the victim. You treated your wife's ailments with anesthetics. The purpose wasn't to anesthetize her but to relieve the pain. Who'd be able to successfully anesthetize a girl weighing roughly 50 kilos? A substance called methitural was mentioned. They stopped producing it in this country. But you might find some across the border. Or if you have access to a lab, you can probably Google it and make it yourself. Thanks. Your wife didn't want to interrupt you. She'll see you back home at dinner. Let's do a background check on Sorjonen. He ordered a sizable drag operation. He wants to search places that are important for the casino project. And the police bring bad publicity and all sorts of difficulties with them. Why can't you ask him to be discreet? I'd like to know if he wants to be discreet first. -No background check without a reason. -So we find one. What's the name of that journalist friend of Anneli's? Jaana Erkki, wasn't it? Have Anneli ask her to do the background check. -That won't stop Sorjonen from digging... -Leave that to me. Hide it. Hide it now! If the tests come back okay, I was thinking it's time to move forward. You're going to find a job? That would be a step forward. Wouldn't it be better to trust the doctor and rest a little more? You're right. Everybody's right. But I need something sensible to do, especially after the move. I hope the tests come back okay and you find something meaningful to do... -and Janina finds new friends... -And you take it easier. -I promised to try. -He's trying. I promise... I'll cut down on work and find other things to do... Answer it. Answer it. Answer it and tell the caller what you were about to tell us! Sorjonen. I'm going to cut down on work and find other stuff. Forget it. What is it? A car dealership. Where is it?
