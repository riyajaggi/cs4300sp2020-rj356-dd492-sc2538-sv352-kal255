 ...AND AN EXPLOSIVE MENU... THAT COULD GET NOISY. ...OF ALL-NEW MYTHS. [ GUNSHOT ] ¶¶ THAT WAS A HECK OF A FART. ¶¶ ON "THE SEARCH," NEW YORK PRODUCT DESIGNER JON LUNG... I CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT THERE AND JUST [IMITATES EXPLOSION] ...TEXAN BIOLOGIST AND MASTER BUILDER BRIAN LOUDEN... LET THE SCIENCE BEGIN! YEAH! ...AND HIS BEST FRIEND, BO, PROVED IN A TRIAL BY MYTH...

 WE ARE GOOD TO GO. Narrator: ...THEY HAD WHAT IT TAKES TO TEST TALL TALES. PLEASE WELCOME THE NEXT GENERATION OF MYTHBUSTERS! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] Narrator: AND SO BEGINS THE NEXT CHAPTER. ¶¶ BRIAN AND JON KICK OFF WITH AN AIRBAG DISASTER. SPEED -- 26 MILES PER HOUR. BOOM! THIS MYTH IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT HAVING YOUR FEET ON THE DASHBOARD... BOOM! ...TURNS YOUR COLLISION... BAM! [ IMITATES EXPLOSION ] ...INTO SOMETHING LETHAL. THAT WAS PERFECT. Narrator: AND... SELFIE STICK! Narrator: ...A ROCKET-POWERED SWORD. Jon: WE'RE TESTING IF A WEAPON CAN SLICE THROUGH A VILLAIN'S NECK... NOW, THAT'S A KNIFE. ...WITH SUCH FORCE AND PRECISION... WELCOME TO THE DANGER ZONE. ...THAT HIS HEAD STAYS ON HIS SHOULDERS AND DOESN'T MOVE. FLAMES EVERYWHERE! CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ¶¶ ¶¶ Narrator: FIRST UP, A MYTH BASED ON THE PARADOX OF A LIFE-SAVING BOMB. EVERY MODERN CAR HAS ONE RIGHT THERE IN THE DASH PRIMED TO GO OFF UPON IMPACT. [ TIRES SCREECHING ] THEY SAVE DRIVERS' LIVES EVERY DAY. BUT THE MYTH IS THAT AN AIRBAG HAS ENOUGH FORCE TO PUT A LAID-OUT PASSENGER IN MORTAL DANGER. ARE YOU REALLY RISKING YOUR LIFE PUTTING YOUR FEET UP? [ TIRES SCREECHING ] BRIAN AND JON STRAP IN TO FIND OUT. THIS ONE'S INTERESTING. I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT IT. RIGHT? I MEAN, HOW COULD AN AIRBAG GO FROM SAVING YOUR LIFE WHILE YOU'RE SITTING LIKE THIS TO KILLING YOU WHEN YOU DO THAT? THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO FIND OUT. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. IT'S LIKE A BOMB IN YOUR FACE READY TO GO OFF. MAYBE THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD START -- BLOW A FEW OF THESE THINGS UP AND SEE HOW MUCH FORCE THEY EXERT. BLOW THINGS UP? I'M IN. ¶¶ HERE WE GO. OLD COUNTERSTEER. [ IMITATES TIRES SCREECHING ] [ WHIMPERING ] ¶¶ HELLO, LADIES. [ CLICKS TONGUE ] I LIKE THAT I -- HI, BO! OH, I WAS TALKING TO YOU! OH, HI, BO! [ LAUGHS ] THIS IS OUR TEST VEHICLE. IT'S SLIGHTLY MODIFIED FOR TV PURPOSES. WAIT. I GOT -- OH. I GOT IT. ¶¶ [ LAUGHS ] BUT IT HAS ALL THE PARTS WE NEED. IT'S GOT THE SEAT, THE DASH WITH THE AIRBAG IN IT. A QUICK MYTHBUSTERS-CUSTOM SUNROOF'S GONNA LET OUR HIGH-SPEED GET A GREAT VIEW INSIDE HERE. AH! GOOD OLD CARDBOARD CARS. FANTASTIC. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA USE FOR OUR FIRST FEET-ON-THE DASHBOARD TEST. Narrator: TO BEGIN TO DIAL IN ON THE LETHALITY OF PLACING YOUR FEET ON THE DASHBOARD... AIRBAG'S ALL WIRED UP. ...WITH BUSTER... CURRENTLY RESTING IN "PIECES," THE GUYS RECRUIT A STAND-IN SIMULAID... THIS IS BEYOND VALET SERVICE. [ Laughing ] YEAH. ...TO SIT IN THE HOT SEAT. [ THUD ] OOPS. SORRY. HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU SEEN THIS? YOU'RE ON A SUMMER ROAD TRIP. THE SUN'S OUT. THE WINDOW'S DOWN. YOUR HAIR'S BLOWING AROUND IN THE WIND. YOUR HAIR'S A MESS. I'M AWFULLY JEALOUS. [ LAUGHS ] WELL, I'M SURE SHE WON'T NEED IT AFTER WE'RE DONE WITH THIS TEST. GOOD. I'M GOING OUT TONIGHT. [ LAUGHS ] AND YOUR LEGS ARE KIND OF CRAMPED, SO YOU PUT THEM UP ON THE DASH. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET INTO A LOW-SPEED FENDER BENDER, LIKE 20, 30 MILES AN HOUR, AND THE AIRBAG DEPLOYS? ¶¶ LET'S GO CRASH THE CAR. OH, LET'S. Narrator: THEIR PRELIMINARY TEST SETUP IS READY TO ROLL. THE AIRBAG IS REMOTE-CONTROL-RIGGED TO RESPOND AS IF IT'S IN A LOW-SPEED IMPACT... AND THE CAR SET UP FOR THE CAMERAS TO GET A GOOD VIEW. I THINK WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE SOME EXTREME YOGA. LIKE...PBHT! ¶¶ FEET ON TOP OF DASHBOARD IN THREE, TWO, ONE. OOH! OH! ¶¶ OH. ¶¶ I SAW HER LEG JUST SHOOT OUT THE ENTIRE DOOR. IT JUST WENT "PBHT"! YEAH. Jon: ONE. OH, MAN. I DON'T REMEMBER HER LEG LOOKING LIKE THAT, RIGHT? YEAH. HOW'S THE OTHER LEG? OH! WHAT? IT'S IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT. WHAT? [ LAUGHS ] ¶¶ OH, MY GOSH. ¶¶ OH, WATCHING IT IN REVERSE. IT'S LIKE THE PARTY HORNS. [ IMITATES HORN BLOWING ] BUT IT'S A FOOT THAT COMES OUT. THAT'S NASTY. [ HORN BLOWS ] Narrator: THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FORCE, AND IT'S CLEAR THERE'S SOMETHING TO THIS MYTH. ¶¶ THE QUESTION IS, WOULD IT BE DEADLY? ¶¶ BUT FIRST, CUE MYTH NUMBER TWO. [ EERIE MUSIC PLAYS ] WHAT'D I MISS? DUDE, THERE'S A VAMPIRE IN THE HOUSE, AND THE GUY'S HIDING IN A BATHROOM WITH A SWORD. ¶¶ OH! HE JUST CLEAN THROUGH THAT DUDE, AND HIS HEAD DIDN'T MOVE AN INCH. WAIT FOR IT. AND HEAD ON THE GROUND. [ THUD ] OH, THAT'S AWESOME! BUT DO YOU THINK THAT COULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE, YOU KNOW? LIKE, CUT A BAD GUY IN HALF, BUT HE DOESN'T MOVE AN INCH. HE JUST FLOPS IN TWO. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. WE HAVE GOT TO TEST THIS. [ SWORD SLASHES, WOMAN SCREAMS ] ¶¶ WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT GUY? ¶¶ Jon: THIS CLASSIC MOVIE TROPE IS SO COMMON THAT IT HAS ITS OWN NAME -- DELAYED CAUSALITY. SO WHETHER IT'S A ZOMBIE OR A MONSTER OR SOME GENERIC BAD GUY McBADDERSON, GETS HIT WITH A BLADE WITH SO MUCH FORCE THAT HIS BODY DOESN'T MOVE UNTIL IT SLIDES APART. SO, SCHWINK! HOLD FOR DRAMATIC PAUSE. ¶¶ [ IMITATES THUD ] THAT'S WHAT I CALL A NIGHT AT THE MOVIES. Narrator: TO BEGIN THEIR DECAPITATION DELIBERATIONS, BRIAN AND JON HAVE ENLISTED WEAPONS-WIELDING EXPERT R.J. McKEEHAN. WHEN IT COMES TO SWORDPLAY... OH, HE DEAD. ...R.J. IS A CHAMPION. OH, GEEZ. HE COMPETES IN AND WINS HISTORICAL MARTIAL-ARTS CUTTING COMPETITIONS. ¶¶ WE'RE GONNA START WITH YOUR SWORD ALL THE WAY OVER YOUR HEAD. ALL RIGHT. AND TO HELP TEST THIS HOLLYWOOD TALL TALE, HE HAS THREE KEY TAKEAWAYS. YOU'RE GONNA NEED PROPER EXTENSION OF THE ARMS, YOU'RE GONNA NEED SPEED, AND YOU'RE GONNA NEED EDGE ALIGNMENT. ¶¶ IT TAKES A WHILE AND A FEW CAMERAS... DID I GET YOU? ARE YOU OKAY? OOH! THIS IS ALMOST PERFECT. Narrator: ...BUT BEFORE LONG... PRETTY GOOD. A LITTLE TINY BIT OF WOBBLE. ...R.J.'s INSTRUCTION HAS BRIAN... ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S NEXT? ...AND JON... ¶¶ [ LAUGHS ] BANANA DROP. ...TAKING OUT BAD-DUDE FOOD WITH ONE CLEAN SLICE. ¶¶ FRUIT SALAD FOR EVERYONE! CHEERS. [ LAUGHS ] CAN'T EVEN TASTE THE SWORD. IT'S LITERALLY THE FRUITS OF OUR LABOR. COMING UP, WITH BUSTER ON SICK LEAVE, THE AIRBAG ANOMALY GETS AN ANATOMICAL UPGRADE. OOH! [ LAUGHS ] AND THE DECAPITATION INVESTIGATION... THREE... ...TAKES OFF. ...TWO, ONE. ¶¶ ¶¶ Narrator: TO CONTINUE THE RICH, VARIED, AND EXPLOSIVE 15-YEAR MYTHBUSTING LEGACY, BRIAN AND JON COMPETED AND EARNED THEIR PLACE ON "THE SEARCH." IT'S EXPLOSIONS. IT'S "MYTHBUSTERS." IT'S BEAUTIFUL. AND I WANT IT TO LAST FOREVER. Narrator: FROM A SIDEWAYS EJECTION SEAT... [ ALL CHEERING ] FIRE! ...TO A MEDIEVAL JUNKYARD CATAPULT... AND EVEN DUCT TAPE BOAT SHOES... "HE'S REALLY DOING IT." ...THEY DISPLAYED THE DESIGN AND BUILD SKILLS, THE ENERGY, ENTHUSIASM, AND LEADERSHIP TO BEAT EIGHT OTHER HOPEFULS... Kyle: BRIAN. JON. ...AND PROVE THEY HAD WHAT IT TAKES. AND SO, THE NEW CHAPTER HAS BEGUN WITH A CAR-CRASH CATASTROPHE AND DELAYED DECAPITATION. WE'RE TESTING THE MOVIE TROPE ABOUT DELAYED CAUSALITY. THAT'S IF A WEAPON CAN SLICE THROUGH A VILLAIN'S NECK WITH SUCH FORCE THAT HIS HEAD STAYS ON HIS SHOULDERS UNTIL IT SLIDES APART. FOR THE SWING, IT'S ALL ABOUT TWO THINGS -- FORCE AND CONTACT AREA... BECAUSE PRESSURE IS FORCE DIVIDED BY AREA. IMAGINE GETTING SLAPPED IN THE FACE BY A HAND. OH! THE AREA OF THE HAND'S RATHER LARGE, SO THE PRESSURE'S NOT THAT MUCH. BUT IF YOU TURN THE HAND INTO A BLADE AND APPLY THE SAME AMOUNT OF FORCE, WELL, THEN THE PRESSURE INCREASES DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE THE CONTACT AREA IS MUCH SMALLER. SO THE SMALLER THE CONTACT AREA, THE BETTER AND MORE EFFECTIVE THE CUT IS. Narrator: THEIR BLADE IS SHARP... THE CONTACT AREA IS AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE... Jon: WE HAVE A WEAPON. SELFIE STICK! Narrator: ...MEANING THE ONLY VARIABLE IS THE FORCE OF THE SWING. AND NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT SPEED. HALF-SPEED SWORD TEST IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ¶¶ Brian: THAT WAS A GOOD CUT, MAN. BUT IT PUSHED IT A LOT TO THE SIDE. Jon: YEAH. THE MORE TIME MY BLADE SPENDS IN CONTACT WITH THE ZOMBIE'S NECK, THERE'LL BE MORE MOVEMENT. SO WE WANT THE BLADE TO PASS THROUGH THE ZOMBIE FASTER, WHICH MEANS LESS MOVEMENT. IN TRANSLATION, WE NEED MORE SPEED. YOU READY FOR THE FULL SPEED, JON? OH, YEAH. HERE WE GO. ¶¶ FULL-SPEED TEST IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ¶¶ VERY NICE. MM. SO, OUR SPEED TESTS WEREN'T SPECTACULARLY CONCLUSIVE. I DID A HALF-SPEED SWING. I DID A FULL-SPEED SWING. AND A FASTER SWING MEANS LESS CONTACT TIME, WHICH SHOULD MEAN LESS MOVEMENT. BUT IT'S STILL HARD TO TELL WITH THE HIGH-SPEED CAMERA. BUT ONE THING'S FOR SURE -- HUMAN SPEEDS JUST AREN'T GONNA CUT IT -- LITERALLY. BUT THE MYTH IS WHETHER A DRAMATIC PAUSE IS POSSIBLE EVER. SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO BUILD A SWORD-SWINGING RIG TO GIVE US SUPER-HUMAN SPEEDS. ¶¶ Narrator: BACK AT CAR-CRASH CENTRAL... Jon: WHOA! OOH! OH! ...BRIAN AND JON HAVE DISCOVERED THAT A PASSENGER WITH THEIR FEET ON TOP OF THE DASH IS IN DANGER. EVERYTHING'S OKAY. GOT HER! BUT IS IT, AS THE MYTH WOULD SUGGEST... YOU GOT IT? ...MORTAL DANGER? BEFORE THEY LOOK AT LETHALITY IN A ROAD TEST... IT'S A SHAME REGULAR MEDICINE ISN'T THIS EASY. RIGHT? ...THEY'RE DOING A QUICK RESET. Brian: LAST AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT WAS A FAIR AMOUNT OF DESTRUCTION. GOOD AS NEW. LEGS WENT FLYING EVERYWHERE. BUT THIS TIME, I EXPECT THOSE LEGS -- THEY'RE PROJECTILES STRAIGHT TO THE FACE. Narrator: YEP. BRIAN THINKS HAVING YOUR FEET FLAT AGAINST THE DASH WOULD JETTISON YOUR KNEES INTO YOUR FACE... JUST... [ LAUGHS ] ...MEANING IT'S THE MOST LIKELY POSITION TO CAUSE A FATALITY. DAMN IT. DO WE HAVE ANY GRIP TAPE? READY? YOUR MYTHBUSTERS MANICURE SERVICE. WE GET RID OF YOUR CORNS, AND THEN PUT YOU IN A CAR AND SET OFF THE AIRBAG. I'M SURPRISED MORE PEOPLE DON'T CALL. BEAUTIFUL. THERE WE GO. OKAY. WHEW! TEST TWO WITH FEET AGAINST THE DASH IN THREE, TWO, ONE. OH! OOH! OH! ONCE AGAIN, IT'S CARNAGE IN THE HALF CAR. LOOK AT THIS. OH! WHETHER IT WAS ANY WORSE IS DIFFICULT TO TELL, BUT IT'S CLEAR THE MYTH IS HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ...ONE. OH! OOH! OH, NO. Jon: WHEN WE WATCHED THE AIRBAG DEPLOY IN REAL TIME, NOT TOO BAD. BUT THEN WE WATCHED THE HIGH-SPEED, AND IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY. THE AIRBAG GOES OFF. WE CAN SEE FROM HER TOES -- JUST SLOWLY CURLED BACK, AND YOU CAN JUST ALMOST IMAGINE THE SOUND OF BONE AND MEAT CRUSHING AND TEARING AS IT GOES [IMITATING TEARING] AND THEY FOLD BACK, AND YOU THINK THAT IT'S OVER, BUT IT'S NOT, BECAUSE THEN THEY SWING OUT THIS WAY. [ IMITATES EXPLOSION ] AND THEY HIT THE FLOOR. IT WAS HORRIFYING. WANT TO GRAB HER FEETSIES? Narrator: QUESTION IS, IS IT LETHAL? FOR THAT, THEY NEED TO STEP IT UP IN THE STAND-IN BUSTER STAKES. ¶¶ MEET BOOMER. Brian: I WORKED IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE FOR OVER HALF A DECADE, AND DURING THAT TIME, I TAUGHT A NUMBER OF PARAMEDICS USING ALL SORTS OF HUMAN ANALOGUES. ¶¶ [ BOTH LAUGH ] OKAY. BUT WE HAVE SOMETHING HERE TODAY THAT IS AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN GET ON THIS ENTIRE PLANET TO A HUMAN BEING WITHOUT HAVING A HUMAN BEING. YOU READY? OOH. YEAH. LET'S GO. GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO, GO. READY? AND I AM VERY EXCITED. OOH! [ Laughing ] OH! [ LAUGHS ] THIS IS A SynDaver, A SYNTHETIC HUMAN CADAVER. HERE YOU GO, SIR. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE CAN ACTUALLY GIVE IT INFECTIONS FROM TOUCHING IT WITH OUR BARE HANDS. AND WHAT MAKES IT SO ACCURATE IS THAT EVERY FIBER OF MUSCLE... GIVE THE BICEPS A SQUEEZE. YOU CAN FEEL ALL THE LITTLE, LIKE, INDIVIDUAL LAYERED MUSCLES ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER. ...EVERY BONE... OH, YOU CAN FEEL THE SKULL! ...EVERY ARTERY AND VEIN INSIDE A HUMAN BEING... THIS IS SOME FRANKENSTEIN STYLE. HIGH FIVE. [ LAUGHS ] ...IS IN THIS FAKE CADAVER. LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THE TONGUE! [ LAUGHS ] I MEAN, IN TERMS OF HUMAN INORGANIC ANALOGUES, THIS IS AS GOOD AS MONEY CAN BUY. ¶¶ ¶¶ Narrator: BRIAN AND JON HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE MOVIE MYTH OF DELAYED CAUSALITY, THE DRAMATIC PAUSE AFTER A DECAPITATION... Jon: YEAH, WE'RE KIND OF TOPPING OUT ON HOW MUCH YOU AND I CAN SWING. I THINK IT'S TIME FOR PLAN B. ...REQUIRES A SWORD SWING OF SUPERHUMAN SPEED. ¶¶ LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA TORTURE SOMEONE. IT'S A TUESDAY. WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING PNEUMATICALLY-POWERED PISTONS, BRIAN HAS HISTORY. ALL THAT PRESSURE FROM THE TANK IS GONNA TAKE THAT PROJECTILE AND THE DOOR RIGHT OFF THE CAR. ON "THE SEARCH," HIS EJECTION SEAT ESTABLISHED HIS MYTHBUSTING CREDENTIALS. SO WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR EVERYDAY... THREE, TWO, ONE. ¶¶ THAT'LL WORK. Narrator: ...NOT-DANGEROUS-AT-ALL... SO, WHEN THIS GOES "HOO! TSSHH"... IT'LL GO "WA-PAH"! ...AIR-CANNON-POWERED SWORD, HE'S YOUR MAN. ¶¶ ALL RIGHT. WHO WANTS AN EXPLANATION? WHAT MAKES A SWORD CUT EFFICIENTLY IS A PUSH AND A DRAW. THE DRAW'S ACTUALLY THE ACTION OF WHEN YOU PULL THAT SWORD BACK, AND IT HAS TO BE A 1:1 RATIO FOR AN EFFECTIVE CUT. SO THAT'S WHY I CAN'T JUST BUILD A RIG WHERE IT GOES "BOOP!" I NEED TO BUILD A RIG THAT GOES "WOO." ¶¶ BRIAN'S PISTON WILL BE ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. SO WHEN IT FIRES... BANG. ...IT'LL GIVE US THAT PERFECT SLICING MOTION. BOOM! Narrator: ON "THE SEARCH," JON PROVED HIS METTLE WITH MEDIEVAL METAL WEAPONRY... I CAN ALMOST TASTE THE CABBAGE. Narrator: ...WINNING MVP FOR HIS JUNKYARD CROSSBOW. CONGRATS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. SO WHEN IT COMES TO ASSEMBLING THE SWORD ARM AND AIR-POWERED MUSCLE, JON AND BRIAN ARE THE MEAN-MACHINE DREAM TEAM. GO. YEAH, THAT'S HORRIFYING. [ LAUGHS ] IT RIDES WELL. UH... HORRIFYING, HORRIFYING. WE DIDN'T EVEN PUT ANYTHING IN, AND I'M SCARED ALREADY. ALL RIGHT. LET'S TRY ONE MORE TIME. ¶¶ [ GASPS ] [ Laughing ] IT'S GIVING ME THE DEATH GIGGLES. WHAT HAVE WE DONE?! LET'S GO HOOK THIS THING UP, MAN. YEAH. ¶¶ Jon: OUR FIRST TEST WILL BE TO GET THIS RIG TO FIRE AT THE FASTEST SPEED THAT I COULD SWING THE SWORD. WE'RE DOING THAT TO SEE IF THIS BLADE WILL GIVE US A NICE, SMOOTH SWING. [ AIR HISSING ] ALL RIGHT, JON. 100 P.S.I. READY TO GO. Jon: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. YOUR FINGER'S ON THE TRIGGER? I'M READY. OKAY. HUMAN SPEED BASELINE TEST IN THREE, TWO, ONE. OH! [ BOTH LAUGH ] WELL, FIRSTLY... YES. SECONDLY, IT IS JUST AS HORRIFYING AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. I LOVE IT, MAN. ...ONE. ¶¶ Brian: A MACHINE DOING THE JOB. I WANT TO CRY AT IT. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. ¶¶ THAT IS OUR SPEED. THAT'S WHAT WE NEEDED. OH. NICE. WANT TO PUT A TARGET IN IT? OH, YEAH. THIS IS HOW MYTHBUSTERS PREP FOR A PICNIC. WELCOME TO THE DANGER ZONE. [ AIR HISSES ] Jon: HUMAN SPEED SWING TEST WITH TARGET IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ¶¶ [ GASPS ] ¶¶ YOU SAW THE TOP OF THAT WATERMELON DO A CARTWHEEL, RIGHT? ¶¶ THE TOP OF THE WATERMELON DIDN'T GET PUSHED FORWARD. IT GOT CUT, AND THEN IT WENT "BLOOP," AND THEN IT FELL OFF. Narrator: SO, THE RIG WORKS. IT'S TIME TO TEST THE MYTH WITH A MORE REALISTIC TARGET. BALLISTICS GEL, AS ALWAYS, IS SOFT TISSUE, AND WE'VE INSERTED A DOWEL TO REPRESENT BONES. Narrator: THIS IS IT. WITH THE AIR-PRESSURE-POWERED RIG CHARGED TO MAXIMUM CAPACITY, WILL IT CUT THE BALLISTICS-GEL NECK SO CLEANLY IT'LL PAUSE FOR DRAMATIC EFFECT? ¶¶ [ AIR HISSING ] [ LAUGHS ] ¶¶ Brian: ALL RIGHT. PERFECT. OH! [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] IS EVERYONE BEHIND? Man: MM-HMM. OKAY. YOU READY? I'M READY. "EVERYTHING WE GOT" TEST, AND I MEAN EVERYTHING, IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ¶¶ WELL... [ SIGHS ] LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK. YEAH. [ Laughing ] HOLY MOLY. WHOA! IT CUT THROUGH... A GOOD PORTION. OH. OH. WHOA! DID SOME DAMAGE TO THE DOWEL, BUT IT DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH. THE COOL PART IS... LOOK HOW CLEAN THAT CUT IS. ¶¶ Narrator: THE HIGH-SPEED CAMERA TELLS THE STORY. ¶¶ THE SWORD IS MOVING AT 110 MILES PER HOUR. IT SLICES CLEAN THROUGH THE FLESH-LIKE BALLISTICS GEL. BUT WHEN IT HITS THE DOWEL REPRESENTING BONE... SO, IT CATCHES THAT DOWEL, AND IT'S PULLING EVERYTHING. YEAH, IT'S BEAUTIFULLY GRUESOME. IT HITS IT SO HARD THAT IT WRECKS THE WHOLE... STAND AND ALL, MAN. MM-HMM. BUT ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL THAT POINT, IT'S A COMPLETELY SMOOTH CUT. THAT'S AS FAST AS THEIR AIR CANNON CAN SWING THE SWORD. AND THERE'S STILL NO SIGN OF THE MYTHICAL CLEAN-CUT SLICE. BUT THEY'RE NOT GIVING UP YET. ¶¶ ¶¶ Jon: YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIND A PLACE TO CRASH A CAR SAFELY, BUT WE'VE HIT THE JACKPOT HERE AT MOUNTAIN VALLEY AIRPORT IN THE HIGH DESERTS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. ¶¶ COME ON, GIRL. Narrator: TO FIND OUT IF PUTTING YOUR FEET UP ON THE DASH PUTS YOU IN MORTAL DANGER FROM AN AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT, BRIAN AND JON HAVE TO SET UP A DRIVERLESS CAR CRASH. THAT'LL DO. YEAH. STEP ONE IS A TOW-RIG PULLEY SYSTEM. ¶¶ THAT'LL DEFINITELY HOLD. I'VE GOT IT, GUYS! STEP TWO, THE CRASHEE. ¶¶ STEP THREE, THE CRASHER. SLOW! ¶¶ LOWER FORKS. ¶¶ Brian: WE'RE ABOUT TO INSTALL A TOW YOKE UNDER OUR VEHICLE. ¶¶ OOPS. WIPER FLUID. ¶¶ Brian: THAT'S TWO ARMS WELDED OUT FROM THE INSIDE OF THE CONTROL ARM WITH A CROSSBEAM, TOW WIRE CONNECTED IN THE MIDDLE. WHOO! [ SQUEAKING ] OH, IT MAKES ITS OWN NOISE. [ SQUEAKING CONTINUES ] THAT WAY, IF OUR CAR BEGINS TO DEVIATE, THE FORCE ON THAT TOW BEAM WILL PULL IT RIGHT INTO OUR TARGET. THIS IS 400 FEET OF STEEL CABLE THAT WE'LL BE USING TO PULL OUR CRASH VEHICLE INTO THAT CRASH BARRIER. NOW WE JUST GOT TO ROLL IT OUT. THIS IS SOME KIND OF, LIKE, CURLING. WE'RE LIKE AN OLYMPIC... WE'RE GONNA BE OLYMPIC-LEVEL CABLE UNSPOOLERS. [ BO BARKING ] WHAT YOU DOING, BO? [ LAUGHS ] -OH. -HERE WE GO. OH, WELL, THIS IS GREAT. GO. Narrator: WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM THEIR FOUR-LEGGED FRIEND, THE CABLE IS LAID, AND THE PULLEY SYSTEM RIGGED. [ Deep voice ] "I AM THE THING." I AM THE THING THAT EATS BREAKFAST SANDWICHES. [ LAUGHS ] BOTH CARS ARE IN PLACE. GOOD TO GO. CUE BOOMER, THE SPOOKILY ACCURATE HUMAN ANALOGUE. OH. OKAY. LET'S GET HER SEAT BELT ON, AND WE'LL SLIDE HER IN? YEAH. Brian: THIS IS A PRICY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT BECAUSE IT HAS BONES, VEINS, WHICH MEANS WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH THIS, THE WAY WE EXAMINE IT IS THE SAME AS A REAL VICTIM IN A CRASH -- WE'LL BE X-RAYING IT. TODAY, WE'RE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE X-RAY TECH MIKE CAIRNIE, AS WELL AS ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON DEVON JEFFCOAT. THEY'RE GONNA GIVE THE SynDavers AN EXAM, SHOOT A COUPLE X-RAYS, AND GIVE US THE RESULTS. LAST-MINUTE BEAUTYING. ¶¶ EH. OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. ¶¶ PERFECT. THERE WE GO. OUR FIRST TEST WITH THE SynDaver -- FEET UP ON THE DASH. WHAT DO I THINK'S GONNA HAPPEN? SO, "WEEKEND AT BERNIE'S" KIND OF SITUATION. I THINK HER LEGS ARE IN BIG TROUBLE, AND I THINK HER FACE IS IN TROUBLE. BAM! FOOT TO THE FACE. Narrator: BUT WILL IT BE LETHAL? ¶¶ THIS IS IT. ABOUT TO HAVE SOME FUN. ¶¶ ALL RIGHT, JON. TOW VEHICLE IS SET TO GO. Narrator: WILL THE SIMPLE ACT OF PLACING YOUR FEET ON THE DASH TURN A LOW-SPEED FENDER BENDER INTO A LIFE-ENDING BANG? OKAY, BRIAN. TEST ONE, FEET ON DASH... IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ¶¶ 5 MILES PER HOUR. ¶¶ TOW RIG LOOKS GOOD SO FAR. OH, WAIT. IS IT VEERING OFF? 12 MILES PER HOUR. UH... 26 MILES PER HOUR. ¶¶ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, BRIAN! MISSION ACCOMPLISHED. [ Laughing ] WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO! ¶¶ YOU KNOW, IT WENT OFF A LITTLE BIT, BUT AT THE END, IT CAME RIGHT BACK, HIT THE CAR. ¶¶ PERFECT DEPLOYMENT. Brian: DID THE YOKE WORK? YEAH, THE YOKE WORKED PRETTY WELL. AH, HECK, YEAH, MAN. WAIT. BUT WAIT. I TOOK A SNEAK PEAK. IT'S A LITTLE BIT GROSS. YOU READY? I'M READY FOR THIS. OKAY. LET'S GO. Narrator: COMING UP... BEFORE THEY ASSESS THE DAMAGE, IT'S BACK TO THE SHOP. IF THERE'S EVER BEEN A CASE FOR "DO NOT TRY AT HOME," THIS WOULD BE IT. ROCKETS PLUS SWORD EQUALS, UH... DEATH, DISMEMBERMENT, ALL-AROUND BAD DAY. ¶¶ ...ONE. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: BRIAN AND JON ARE TESTING THE WELL-WORN MOVIE MYTH THAT AFTER A GENERIC BAD GUY IS DECAPITATED, THERE'S A DRAMATIC PAUSE. THE PROBLEM WE'RE HAVING RIGHT NOW IS SPEED! WE NEED MUCH MORE OF IT. THAT CUT HAS TO HAPPEN SO FAST THAT WE'RE BUILDING A ROCKET SWORD. Narrator: IT'S GOING TO BE EXACTLY AS RIDICULOUS AND DANGEROUS AS IT SOUNDS -- A MEDIEVAL ROCKET-POWERED SWORD... OH, YEAH. TA-DA! ...DESIGNED TO DECAPITATE. Jon: THE KEY TO GETTING MAXIMUM SPEED OUT OF A ROCKET SLED IS REDUCING THE WEIGHT SO THE ROCKETS DON'T HAVE TO PUSH A HEAVY LOAD ACROSS THE 50 FEET OF OUR TRACK. SO THAT'S WHY I'M MAKING THE RIG AS MINIMAL AS POSSIBLE, MAKING IT OUT OF ALUMINUM, WHICH IS REALLY LIGHT AND STRONG.. WHOOSH! YEAH, THAT'LL WORK. Narrator: IN ADDITION TO SETTING UP THE TRACK ALONG WHICH THE ROCKET BLADE WILL RUN... ALL RIGHT. ROCKET FORCE TEST IN THREE, TWO, ONE. Narrator: ...BRIAN'S DOING SOME ROCKET SCIENCE. ¶¶ THAT WAS A GREAT TEST OF OUR ROCKET. WE GOT ABOUT 23.8 NEWTONS OF FORCE. Narrator: WHICH MEANS WITH A SLED WEIGHING... ABOUT 4 1/2 KILOGRAMS. Narrator: ...AND ADJUSTING FOR FRICTION, 20 ROCKETS WILL SEND THEIR SWORD FLYING... FIRE. GAAHH! ...AT MORE THAN 150 MILES AN HOUR... FIRE! ...TWICE THE SPEED OF A HUMAN SWING. GO, GO, GO, GO, GO! FIRE! ONE MORE! [ IMITATES EXPLOSION ] MM! THAT'S NOT BAD. I THINK THAT'S READY FOR ROCKETS. [ LAUGHS ] OUR RIG IS SET UP TO TEST WHETHER OR NOT A BLADE MOVING WITH ENOUGH SPEED CAN CUT CLEAN THROUGH A TARGET WHILE LEAVING IT COMPLETELY INTACT. BUT FIRST, WE'RE GONNA DO A DRY RUN WITHOUT A TARGET JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WORKS SMOOTHLY. PERFECT. ¶¶ Brian: FOR THIS DRY-RUN TEST, WE'RE LOOKING FOR THREE THINGS -- ARE OUR TRACKS ALIGNED, ARE WE GETTING THE FORCES WE NEED FROM THE ROCKET, AND WHAT IS THE OPTIMUM POSITION FOR OUR TARGET? ¶¶ EYES AND EARS AND HATS ON. SO COOL. OH, I'M NERVOUS. [ Laughing ] HERE WE GO. ROCKET SLED DRY TEST IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ¶¶ I THINK THAT'S SUCCESSFUL. IT'S LIKE CHRISTMAS. FIREWORKS. OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL! [ LAUGHS ] WE'RE GOOD. WELL... LIKE, IT HIT THE END OF THE TRACK, AND IT WENT "AAH!" ¶¶ THE ROCKET SLED PERFORMED EXACTLY HOW I WANTED IT TO. ¶¶ EVERYTHING WORKED FANTASTICALLY. IN TERMS OF POWER AND SPEED, I THINK WE GOT IT. I THINK I'M GONNA JUST WIPE IT DOWN, GET SOME OF THE SCHMUTZ OFF, AND TIGHTEN A FEW THINGS, AND WE'LL SET UP FOR THE NEXT TEST. Narrator: IT'S A MAGNIFICENT AND TERRIFYING SIGHT TO BEHOLD -- A RAZOR-SHARP BLADE POWERED BY ROCKETS LAUNCHED AT 165 MILES AN HOUR. OUR DRY RUN WENT GREAT. WE GOT THE RESULTS WE WERE LOOKING FOR. BUT BEFORE WE GRADUATE TO THE FINAL EVENT, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SOFT-TARGET TEST. [ ROOSTER CROWS ] [ IMITATING WINGS FLAPPING ] HOO! OKAY, JUST STAY HERE, AND I WILL BE RIGHT BACK. ¶¶ IGNITION...ENGAGED. OH. OH, THERE IT IS. UH-OH. OKAY. I WILL COUNT YOU DOWN, BROTHER. OH, I CAN'T WAIT TO FIRE AT A CHICKEN. [ Laughing ] OKAY. ROCKET BLADE SLED AT TARGET. JUST STAY THERE, CHICKEN! IT'LL BE OKAY! [ CHICKEN CLUCKS ] IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ¶¶ [ LAUGHS ] ¶¶ Jon: OH! [ LAUGHS ] OH, NO! MY FOOD! WELL, ACTUALLY... BRING IT ON OVER. ...IT'S A PRETTY GOOD HALF CHICKEN. WHOA! THAT'S NOT BAD. LOOK AT THIS! IT CUT THROUGH THE BONE THE LONG WAY. [ LAUGHS ] THAT IS A PERFECT CUT THROUGH THERE. THAT'S IMPRESSIVE. WHOA! OKAY. THAT BLADE TRAVELED STRAIGHT THROUGH THE CHICKEN. SUPER-CLEAN CUT. LOOK AT THAT JUICE FLYING EVERYWHERE. IT'S BARELY -- OH. [ Laughing ] AND THEN IT GETS... OH! ...IT GETS RAILROADED. Narrator: SO, THERE'S A SLIGHT PROBLEM WITH THE RIG. ¶¶ THE BACK END OF THE SLED CRASHES INTO THE TARGET. IF THERE WAS A DRAMATIC PAUSE, IT WAS RUN OVER. ¶¶ FOR THE FINAL TEST, THE GUYS ADD A BACKSTOP. OH, AND A ZOMBIE. Brian: TO TEST THIS, WE NEED A TARGET TO FIT THE MYTH. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A ZOMBIE. THIS IS LARRY. HE USED TO BE ONE OF OUR "MYTHBUSTERS" PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, THAT IS, UNTIL THE OUTBREAK. BUT NOW HE'S VOLUNTEERED TO BE OUR TARGET. THANKS, LARRY! [ High-pitched voice ] YOU'RE WELCOME, JON! ¶¶ I'LL TURN THE KEY. YOU FLIP THE SWITCH. SURE. BAD BOYS FOR LIFE. HERE WE GO. OKAY. ROCKET BLADE TEST WITH VERY NERVOUS ZOMBIE IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ¶¶ OH! [ LAUGHS ] OH! WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON? FIRE EXTINGUISHER, PLEASE. ¶¶ [ LAUGHS ] ¶¶ [ LAUGHS ] THAT WAS SPECTACULAR. ¶¶ OH! [ LAUGHS ] YOU READY FOR THIS? YEAH. OH! IT CHOPPED THROUGH SKIN, TISSUE, BONE. WAIT. WHERE'S THE HEAD? [ Laughing ] WHERE IS THE HEAD, MAN? OH! [ LAUGHS ] WHEW! IT SCARED ME A BIT. OH! LET'S LOOK AT THE... OHHH! LOOK HOW CLEAN THIS CUT IS! THAT'S INCREDIBLE. LIKE, THE BONE AND THE FLESH, MAN. CLEAN CUT! HOWEVER, I DID SEE THE HEAD ROLL OFF. BUT I CAN'T TELL IF IT WAS 'CAUSE EVERYTHING WAS SHAKING OR IF IT STAYED AND THEN LOPPED OFF. WE'LL HAVE TO CHECK THE HIGH-SPEED. HERE...WE...GO. Brian: OH. HERE IT COMES. ¶¶ SLICING IT. [ GASPS, LAUGHS ] OH! THAT COULD NOT HAVE MORE PRECISION OR POWER. BUT YOU CAN SEE, AS THE BLADE IS DRAWING ACROSS OUR TARGET, THAT IT, LIKE, STARTS TO PUSH INTO IT, AND IT CAUSES THE HEAD TO [IMITATES EXPLOSION] ROLL OFF. YEAH, LIKE, NO DELAY EVEN ON HIGH-SPEED. NOPE. Narrator: THE MYTH, MUCH LIKE THE BURNING REMAINS OF THE ROCKET SLED... [ GASPS ] FLAMES EVERYWHERE! ...IS TOAST. OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL! FIREWORKS. ¶¶ DELAYED CAUSALITY -- WHAT DO YOU THINK? I MEAN, EVEN WITH OUR ROCKET SLED AND A SUPER-SHARP BLADE, COULDN'T GET THE HEAD TO STAY ON. YEAH, WORKS GREAT IN THE MOVIES, BUT IN REAL LIFE -- BUSTED. BUSTED. [ High-pitched voice ] BUSTED! ¶¶ I'M JUST GLAD THE WORLD'S SAFER WITH ONE LESS ZOMBIE. ¶¶ [ MAN LAUGHS EVILLY ] ¶¶ COMING UP, THE MYTH OF THE FOOT-RESTING PASSENGER... SPEED -- 26 MILES PER HOUR. Narrator: ...HITS THE END OF THE ROAD. [ TIRES SCREECHING ] [ CRASH ] ¶¶ COUNTDOWN. THREE, TWO, ONE. HE STARTS ROLLING. EVERYTHING'S LOOKING PRETTY SMOOTH. HE'S CALLING OUT... 5 MILES PER HOUR. Jon: "...12 MILES AN HOUR," AND I'M LIKE, "HEY, IS THAT CAR VEERING OFF?" SPEED -- 26 MILES PER HOUR. SHOULD WE ABORT THIS THING? THE CAR GOES "WREECK!" BOOM! ¶¶ AIRBAGS DEPLOY PERFECTLY. DIDN'T SEEM TOO BAD. BUT THEN YOU GET INTO THE CAR, AND YOU SEE THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE SynDaver... OH, NO. THERE'S SMOKE COMING OUT OF HER FOOT! COME ON! ...WITH THAT FOOT JUST HANGING OFF THE DASH. SKIN'S BEEN RIPPED OFF THE TOE, COMPLETE ANKLE DISLOCATION. AND THAT'S JUST WHAT I CAN SEE FROM HERE. SUPER-GRUESOME, BUT THEN YOU REALIZE HOW AWESOME IT IS TO HAVE THE SynDaver FOR OUR TESTS. [ CRASH ] IT'S GOT EVERY BONE, MUSCLE FIBER, VEIN, SKIN TISSUE THAT WE CAN ANALYZE TO SEE WHAT REAL DAMAGE WOULD OCCUR TO A REAL HUMAN BEING. [ CRASH ] ¶¶ Narrator: BUT BEFORE THE GUYS SEND THE PATIENT OFF FOR AN X-RAY... [ FORKLIFT BEEPING ] ...MR. BOOMER TAKES HIS TURN AT THE WHEEL. ¶¶ Brian: THIS TIME, OUR CARELESS GENTLEMAN HAS HIS FEET FLAT AGAINST THE DASH. I THINK THIS IS THE BEST CHANCE OF DOING SOME DAMAGE. KNEES ARE UP, UP INTO THE CHEST, UP INTO THE FACE. ALL RIGHT, BRIAN. YOU READY? GOOD TO TOW. [go] [ CHUCKLES ] NICE. OKAY. FEET AGAINST DASH IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ¶¶ 5 MILES PER HOUR. TOW RIG IS LOOKING GOOD. 15 MILES PER HOUR. SPEED... WHOA! ...26 MILES PER HOUR. [ TIRES SCREECHING ] OH. OKAY. STOP. [ GLASS SHATTERING ] OH. THERE GOES THE CAMERA. OKAY. THAT WAS INTERESTING. YOU WANT TO COME DOWN HERE, BRIAN? SO, THAT DIDN'T QUITE GO AS PLANNED. THE CAR STARTED OUT NICE... THEN BEGAN TO VEER. [ TIRES SCREECHING ] IT WHIPPED AROUND THE TARGET VEHICLE, BUT THE AIRBAG WENT OFF... [ CRASH ] ...WHICH IS INTERESTING TO US. ¶¶ HOW WOULD I SUM UP WHAT JUST HAPPENED FOR OUR TEST? WELL, EVEN THOUGH THE CAR DIDN'T HIT THE CRASH BARRIER, IT STILL CLIPPED THE SIGN VIOLENTLY ENOUGH TO FIRE OFF THAT AIRBAG. Narrator: AND THAT ALONE CAUSED SOME SEVERE LOWER-LEG DAMAGE. BUT THE MYTH PARAMETERS REQUIRE AN AIRBAG DEPLOYMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN IMPACT. SO A QUICK REALIGNMENT OF THE TOW RIG, AND... Jon: SO, OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE IT AT THAT. WE'RE GONNA GET A NEW AIRBAG IN THERE AND DO IT ONE MORE TIME. HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED ANYTHING?! ¶¶ ALL RIGHT, BRIAN. EVERYTHING IS IN POSITION. YOU READY? COPY. TOW IS GO. OKAY. FEET AGAINST DASH IN THREE, TWO, ONE. ¶¶ 5 MILES PER HOUR. ¶¶ 15 MILES PER HOUR. OOH. YOU'RE FLYING PRETTY TRUE, BRIAN. SPEED -- 26 MILES PER HOUR. ¶¶ THAT WAS PERFECT! ¶¶ [ SIGHS ] SO NICE. Narrator: SO, HOW DID OUR VOLUNTEER FARE WITH HIS FEET AGAINST THE DASH IN A CRASH? SOLIDIFY YOURSELF IN YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH WAY FEET FACE. OKAY. OH! THAT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN, NO? NO. IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD. BUT IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT THE TRUE EXTENT OF THE INJURIES. TWO ACCIDENTS LIKE THIS IN A DAY -- WHAT ARE THE ODDS? X-RAY? X-RAY. ¶¶ OH, THAT'S PRETTY UNSTABLE. ¶¶ YEAH, THAT'S DEFINITELY BROKEN THERE. YEAH, THAT'S BROKEN THERE, TOO. YEAH, WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GET A PELVIS AND A HIP X-RAY OVER HERE. ¶¶ SO, DEVON, TWO DIFFERENT SynDavers, YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THEM. WHAT DO YOU FIND? WELL, BOTH OF THEM HAD A PRETTY BAD ANKLE TRAUMA. OUR SITUATION WITH THE FEMALE PATIENT -- AS YOU CAN SEE, SHE HAD A REALLY BAD ANKLE FRACTURE, WHICH WE SOMETIMES CALL A PILON FRACTURE. BAD INJURY, BUT SURVIVABLE. OUR MALE PATIENT -- SIMILAR INJURY. [ CRASH ] BUT BOTH SURVIVABLE. SO INJURY, BUT NOTHING LETHAL. SURVIVABLE INJURIES ONLY. Narrator: AS GRUESOME AS THE HIGH-SPEED FOOTAGE IS, THE ANATOMICALLY ACCURATE SynDavers... [ CRASH ] [ TIRES SCREECHING ] [ CRASH ] ...PROVE THE INJURIES ARE RESTRICTED TO THE FEET AND ANKLES. ¶¶ I MEAN, IT'S JUST SO CLOSE TO PLAUSIBLE, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY BUSTED. BUSTED. NASTY, THOUGH. YEAH. I DEFINITELY WON'T BE PUTTING MY FEET ON THE DASH ANYMORE. NAH. THAT WAS A GOOD DAY, THOUGH. I LIKE HOW, LIKE, ON VIDEO, THIS IS, LIKE, THE BIT OF THE NEWS WHERE THEY CUT AWAY, BUT THEY'RE STILL SHUFFLING, AND THEY'RE BOTH TALKING TO EACH OTHER. LIKE, WHAT DO THEY TALK ABOUT? OR JUST, LIKE, TALK ABOUT NONSENSE. ¶¶
