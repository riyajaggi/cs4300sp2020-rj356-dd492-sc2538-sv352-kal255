  Narrator: ON THIS WET... All: WHOA! Narrator: ...AND WILD EPISODE  OF "MYTHBUSTERS"... OOH, I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE I'M NOT REALLY IN CONTROL! WHOO! HERE'S A LITTLE MATH FOR YOU -- FLAT TIRES PLUS  POLICE CHASING YOUR BUTT... WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!  -OH, HE IS LOSING IT. ...EQUALS  "SEE YOU IN JAIL, BUDDY." ACCORDING TO THE MURMURINGS  OF THE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD, YOU CAN DEFEAT A SPIKE STRIP. SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY  A COUPLE OF DIY METHODS

 FOR TOUGHENING UP OUR TIRES... THAT'S NOT  A SEXY RIDE AT ALL! ...AS WELL AS  AN OUTRAGEOUS DRIVING MANEUVER RIGHT OUT OF A HYPED-UP  HOLLYWOOD HEIST. Narrator: ...AND BRIAN AND JON  MEET UP WITH A COUPLE OF OLD PALS FROM "THE SEARCH"  TO POWER UP A SUPER FOUNTAIN. WE'RE TESTING THE MYTH THAT  AN OLD MAN IN AN INNER TUBE... YEAH, I THINK HE HAD A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH TO DRINK THIS TIME. ...ACCIDENTALLY FLOATS  HIS WAY OVER A FOUNTAIN AND GETS SHOT UP INTO THE AIR,  BEING SUSPENDED BY THE WATER. COME ON!  COME ON! COME ON! COME ON! WHOO! ♪♪

 ♪♪ CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY  DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: THE FIRST MYTH OFF THE BLOCKS INVOLVES AN ENTICING, YET HIGHLY DANGEROUS COCKTAIL --  ALCOHOL AND WATER. THE STORY GOES THAT  A TIPSY SENIOR CITIZEN DECIDED TO FINISH OFF  AN EVENING OF DRINKING WITH A DIP IN  HIS HOTEL'S DORMANT FOUNTAIN. FLOATING IN AN INFLATABLE RING, HE BOBBED ACROSS THE WATER'S  SURFACE IN A GENTLE STUPOR, UNTIL, THAT IS,  THE FOUNTAIN SPRANG TO LIFE, SUSPENDING THE STARTLED  SENIOR HIGH IN THE AIR FOR SEVERAL SECONDS. BUT WHEN THE MYTHBUSTERS  INVESTIGATE THIS TRUNK MISADVENTURE, WILL IT HOLD WATER OR IS IT  MERELY HYDRODYNAMIC HYPERBOLE? WELL, THIS SOUNDS LIKE  A SENIOR'S PARTY GONE WRONG. YEAH, I'D SAY GONE WRONG  AND THEN SOME. IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME  THAT THOSE GREAT FOUNTAINS IN VEGAS AND DUBAI AREN'T  GOING TO LET US DO THIS. YOU MEAN BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THEIR PUBLIC IMAGE? YEAH, EXACTLY. BUT THAT MEANS WE GET  TO BUILD A SUPER FOUNTAIN, AND I'VE NEVER  DONE THAT BEFORE. OH, WAIT. HERE'S THE SURPRISE --  I HAVEN'T EITHER. LET'S DO IT. BUT BEFORE THE GUYS GO  FULL VEGAS AND ENGINEER A SUPER FOUNTAIN, THEY NEED TO LEARN  HOW TO OPTIMIZE ITS DESIGN TO LIFT AND HOLD  A FLOATING OBJECT. LUCKILY FOR US, WE HAVE  A CUSTOM-BUILT "MYTHBUSTERS" FOUNTAIN RIGHT HERE,  INCLUDING A POWERFUL PUMP, A FLOW REGULATOR VALVE, A RESERVOIR WITH ENOUGH WATER  FOR CONTINUOUS FLOW, AND A SERIES OF  INTERCHANGEABLE NOZZLES THAT WILL HELP US FIND  THE OPTIMUM STREAM TO GIVE THIS MYTH  THE BEST CHANCE. Both: OH! THAT'S MORE REASONABLE. Brian:  THIS MYTH IS ABOUT A PERSON BEING LEVITATED  BY A STREAM OF WATER, BUT A PERSON  IS ODDLY SHAPED. OOH! WE'RE GOING TO START  WITH SOMETHING WITH A LITTLE SIMPLER  PHYSICAL PROPERTY -- A SPHERE. ALL RIGHT.  -LET'S DO IT. Narrator: THE FIRST NOZZLE UP  FOR TESTING IS MEDIUM-SIZED AND PRODUCES WHAT IS KNOWN  AS A CLEAR STREAM JET. SO IS IT CAPABLE OF SUSPENDING  A FOAM BALL IN MIDAIR? Both: OH! -IT LOOKED SO PROMISING.  -YOU KNOW WHAT? I STARTED TO SEE  SOMETHING, THOUGH. SHE'S GOING TO FALL OUT TO ONE SIDE, BUT WATCH AS IT COMES OUT, IT STARTS TO SPIN  AND SLOW DOWN ITS FALL. AH!  YOU SEE IT HANG UP? IT ROLLS OFF THE STREAM. I THINK WE NEED  A LITTLE MORE STREAM. LET'S DO IT. WHOO! OH!  OH! THAT BALL IS LEVITATING. -WHOA.  -THAT'S GREAT, MAN. HOLY MOLY!  IT'S KIND OF LIKE BLACK MAGIC. BUT THE HIGH-SPEED FOOTAGE  REVEALS THIS IS NO WITCHERY. IT'S PURE PHYSICS. THE BALL IS NOT  IN THE JET. IT'S OFF TO THE SIDE  AND IT'S CONSTANTLY SPINNING. RIGHT? THAT'S THAT HYDRODYNAMIC EFFECT. OBVIOUSLY GRAVITY IS PULLING THE BALL DOWN, BUT THE WATER IS PUSHING IT UP AND OUT, BUT THE IMPORTANT FORCE, THAT WATER BEING FLUNG AROUND, PUSHING IT BACK INTO THE STREAM  AND STABILIZING IT. IT'S A SPECTACULAR TRICK  THE GUYS REPEAT WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT  BALLS AND NOZZLES. BUT THE HYDRODYNAMIC  EFFECT MOST LIKELY DOESN'T EXPLAIN THIS MYTH. THAT'S COOL,  BUT CHECK THIS OUT. BUSTER IN HIS INNER TUBE,  NO MAGIC CARPET RIDE. SO IT'S BACK TO TESTING AND TIME  FOR A SWITCH OF BALLS. WE HAVE THIS ONE. YEAH. IT'S HEAVIER THAN THIS ONE. IT'S SMALLER, TOO. WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS? YEAH.  HERE WE GO! OKAY. OH! OH! SO CLOSE!  -OH! OH! I SHOULDN'T HAVE YELLED. I WAS SO EXCITED  FOR LIKE 1/10 OF A SECOND. THE JET IS JUST TOO TURBULENT, AND BECAUSE SOME SECTIONS  OF THE WATER COLUMN ARE MOVING FASTER THAN OTHERS,  THE INTERNAL DIFFERENCES IN PRESSURE THIS CREATES  THROWS THE BALL OUT EVERY TIME. I THINK A SMALLER NOZZLE  IS GOING TO PULL A LITTLE TRICK HERE  THAT WE NEED. BRIAN IS BACKING  A SMALL CLEAR STREAM NOZZLE TO PRODUCE A LESS TURBULENT JET IN WHICH THE WATER IS MOVING AT  A MORE UNIFORM SPEED WITH LESS DESTABILIZING VARIANCE  AND INTERNAL PRESSURE. GIVE HER A SHOT. OH, COME ON! OOH, LOOK AT THAT! THAT'S BEAUTIFUL,  AND I THINK THAT MEANS THESE NOZZLES ARE  IMPORTANT. IN FACT, SEVERAL NOZZLE TYPES,  WHICH PRODUCE A MORE STABLE, LESS TURBULENT JET, ALSO STEADILY SUSPEND  WEIGHTIER RUBBER BALLS. THERE YOU HAVE IT. THIS IS A DIFFERENT PHYSICS PRINCIPAL THAN WE SAW LAST TIME. YEAH. AND A COMPARISON WITH  THE HYDRODYNAMIC EFFECT REVEALS WHY THESE  DIFFERING PHYSICS COULD BE CRUCIAL  TO SOLVING THIS MYTH. Brian: THAT'S THE HYDRODYNAMIC EFFECT AND THAT'S  BERNOULLI EFFECT. MM. IT ALMOST DOESN'T LOOK  LIKE THE BALL IS MOVING. IT'S JUST WATER MOVING UP  AND AROUND IT. THE BERNOULLI EFFECT,  IT'S LIKE CUPPED HANDS. THE TOP OF THAT STREAM  HOLDS THE BALL IN THE CENTER, AND IF IT'S PUSHED  OFF TO THE SIDE, THERE'S ACTUALLY EXTRA FORCE  FROM THAT MOVEMENT AND LESS FORCE ON THE OTHER SIDE BECAUSE THE BALL HAS MOVED OVER, MAKING THAT BALL WANT TO SHIFT  BACK INTO THE CENTER, HOLDING IT STEADY, AND THAT BERNOULLI FORCE  IS EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. Narrator: BUT BEFORE MINI BUSTER  GETS TO RIDE IN THE JET FLOW... LET'S SWERVE OVER TO A MYTH  ABOUT FLEEING THE FIVE-O. [ SIRE] THEY'RE EVERY GETAWAY DR  LET'S SWERVE OVER TO A MYTH  NIE -- ROAD SPIKES.IVE-O. YET SOME FELONS CLAIM  TO HAVE BEATEN A BLOWOUT AND THE BEST EFFORTS  OF THE BOYS IN BLUE. THEIR SECRET --  DIY TOUGHENED TIRES. BUT WHEN THE MYTHBUSTERS  INVESTIGATE, WILL THESE CRIMINAL CLAIMS  HOLD FIRM OR HIT THE SKIDS? THIS IS JON LUNG REPORTING  LIVE FOR "MYTHBUSTERS NEWS," AT WHAT APPEARS TO BE  A HORRIFIC ACCIDENT INVOLVING AN OVERTURNED  TANKER TRAILER JUST A 1/4 MILE  OUTSIDE OF HAZMAT CITY! ACTUALLY, THIS IS JON LUNG  REPORTING FOR "MYTHBUSTERS" AT DEL VALLE  DISASTER TRAINING FACILITY WHERE FIREFIGHTERS TRAIN  EVERY DAY FOR REAL LIFE DISASTERS JUST LIKE THIS, AND  IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE FOR US TO HAVE OUR OWN  LITTLE DISASTER INVOLVING SOME SPIKE STRIPS. -THE BEST STUFF.  -[ WHISTLES ] -THIS IS A REAL SPIKE STRIP.  -WOW. THAT'S NOTHING  BUT BUSINESS, HUH? LOOK AT THIS. THE SPIKES COME RIGHT OUT, AND THEY'RE HOLLOW TO BLEED THE AIR OUT. THESE LITTLE FEET  ACTUALLY GET CAUGHT SO IT CAN TILT EITHER WAY AS THAT WHEEL COMES IN, LINING UP THOSE  SPIKES PERFECTLY. IT'S GENIUS. AND IT'S THESE DESIGN NUANCES  WHICH MAKE THE SPIKE STRIP SUCH AN EFFECTIVE  CAR-KILLING TOOL. IN FACT, THEY'RE SO EFFECTIVE THAT RUN OVER THEM SLOW  OR RUN OVER THEM FAST, AND YOU'RE ON A HIGHWAY  TO NOWHERE BUT FLATSVILLE. [ AIR HISSING ] YOU HEAR THAT, BRIAN? YEAH. THAT'S THE OVERWHELMING  SOUND OF OUR CAR GETTING ITS BUTT KICKED BY THAT SPIKE STRIP. UNSURPRISINGLY, WHEN IT COMES  TO BEATING THE SPIKE STRIP, AIR-FILLED TIRES  PROVED A REAL LETDOWN. BUT THERE'S NO NEED  TO FEEL DEFLATED. WHEN THE MYTHBUSTERS RETURN... IF YOU CAN RAISE  A HOUSE WITH IT, YOU COULD PROBABLY  SPIKE-PROOF A TIRE. ...THEY'LL TOUGHEN UP A SET  OF TIRES WITH A/B FOAM... IT'S TIME TO ROLL OUT  THE WELCOME MAT. ...AND THEN RUN  THIS ROAD BLOCK FOR REAL. AND IN THE MYTH  OF THE GEEZER GEYSER... Man:  LOOK AT THAT! ...THE FUN CONTINUES AT  A POOL PARTY WITH OLD PALS. YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT ENOUGH FORCE, PUSHING OLD BUSTER UP. -YOU THINK?  -YEAH. Narrator: CAN A GETAWAY DRIVER  BEAT A SPIKE STRIP AND ESCAPE THE POLICE WITH  THE AID OF DIY-TOUGHENED TIRES? BRIAN AND JON ARE GOING  TO MAKE THEIR OWN AND PUT THEM TO THE TEST. -A.  -A. -B.  -WHOO! ALL RIGHT.  THERE YOU GO -- A/B FOAM. THIS STUFF,  YOU FIND IT EVERYWHERE. I MEAN, THEY LITERALLY  INSULATE STUFF WITH IT ALL THE WAY TO RAISING  THE FOUNDATION OF A HOUSE, AND YOU FIGURE IF YOU CAN  RAISE A HOUSE WITH IT YOU COULD PROBABLY  SPIKE-PROOF A TIRE. -READY?  -YEAH. ALL RIGHT, YOU STAND BACK, BUDDY. SHOULD I COVER YOUR BEARD  WITH MY HAND OR SOMETHING? IT PROTECTS ITSELF. -OH! COMING OUT OF THAT ONE.  -THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT.  AND THIS ONE. I'D SAY THAT'S FULL. DON'T GET IN THE CROSSFIRE. HOW IS MY BEARD? IT'S DOING PRETTY GOOD. ALL RIGHT. Narrator: ONCE THE FOAM IS  CURED, THE GUYS SNAP OFF THE EXCESS, WELD UP  THE FILL HOLES, AND THEIR  DIY-TOUGHENED TIRES ARE DONE. BUT IS A/B FOAM A SPIKE BUSTER? TIME FOR THE RUBBER  TO MEET THE ROAD. [ LAUGHS ] Brian: THERE'S TWO DRIVING  COMPONENTS TO EVERY HEIST -- GETTING TO YOUR HEIST,  GETTING AWAY FROM YOUR HEIST. WE'RE GOING TO PUT OUR MODIFIED  TIRES THROUGH BOTH THOSE TESTS. THE FIRST TEST IS  GOING TO BE THIS COURSE, WHICH IS A DAILY DRIVING HOW-DOES-IT-HANDLE TYPE OF TEST. JUST A LITTLE BIT OF WEAVING,  A FEW SPEED BUMPS, A SHARP CORNER, AND A LONG DRIVE  UP TO THE FINISH LINE. WHERE IT WILL BECOME  OUR STARTING LINE FOR TEST TWO. NOW WE'LL BE DRIVING AWAY  FROM THE SCENE OF OUR CRIME AS IF WE'RE BEING CHASED  BY THE COPS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY,  WE'LL BE HITTING THEIR SPIKE STRIPS IMMEDIATELY. NOT ONLY DO WE CARE  ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE TIRES  ON THE SPIKE STRIPS, BUT ALSO WHAT HAPPENS  TO THEM AFTERWARDS AND HOW THE CAR HANDLES BECAUSE  WHAT GOOD IS A GETAWAY CAR IF YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY? OOH.  GOOD PASS, GOOD PASS. ♪♪ IT'S GOOD TO GO. THESE FOAM-FILLED TIRES  AREN'T MUCH HEAVIER THAN THE AIR-FILLED TIRES,  WHICH IS GOOD FOR HANDLING. BUT THE BONUS IS, WITH THE  EXTRA-RIGID FOAM INSIDE, WHEN THEY ROLL OVER THE SPIKES  AND ALL THE AIR FALLS OUT IT SHOULD STILL BE GOOD. A/B FOAM HANDLING TEST  IN THREE, TWO, ONE! Brian: OH, IT'S A LITTLE ROAD  CONSTRUCTION. OH, WHAT'S THIS, SOME POTHOLES?  OH, I HATE THESE POTHOLES. OH, GOSH. -WHOO!  -YEAH. OVERALL THOUGH, I MEAN,  THIS IS A REALLY SMOOTH DRIVE. Jon: AND HE'S BACK. Narrator: SO ON THE LEISURELY  DRIVE TO THE HEIST, THE A/B FOAM-FILLED TIRES  PERFORMED WELL. IT'S TIME TO ROLL OUT  THE WELCOME MAT. BUT HOW WILL THEY FARE  ON A HIGH-SPEED GETAWAY? [ TIRES SQUEAL ] OOH. LOOK AT THAT PEEL OUT. AND -- OOH! I CAN HEAR THE AIR LEAVING THOSE TIRES. WHAT A SATISFYING SOUND. OH, OH SNAP! OH! I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CONTROL  HE REALLY HAS LEFT BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE HE JUST BARRELED THROUGH ALL THAT STUFF. OH, GOOD LORD.  ALL RIGHT, HERE HE COMES. WHOA, LOOK AT THAT! THE FRONT ONE IS RUNNING  A LITTLE FLAT, BUT THE BACK TWO SEEM LIKE  THEY'RE DOING FINE. BUT THE SOUND ON THAT  TURN SUGGESTS OTHERWISE. OH, MY GOODNESS. WHOO-WEE! Narrator: THE HIGH-SPEED FOOTAGE  SHOWS THE A/B FOAM TIRES SEEM TO STAND UP PRETTY WELL  TO THE SPIKE STRIP. CAN YOU HEAR THAT, BRIAN? IT'S THE SOUND OF US  GOING TO PRISON. [ LAUGHS ] BUT WITH NO AIR  LEFT IN THE TIRES, THE FOAM TAKES THE FULL BRUNT  OF THE SPEED BUMPS, BEGINS TO DISINTEGRATE,  AND BY THE SECOND LAP, BRIAN IS DRIVING ON FOUR FLATS. I MEAN, I'M WATCHING YOU  MAKE THOSE TURNS AND STUFF, AND YOU'RE LOSING  MORE AND MORE CONTROL EVERY TIME  YOU MAKE A LAP. -YEAH. THAT'S EXACTLY IT.  -KIND OF NUTS. I WAS LIKE, "I THINK I COULD PROBABLY MAKE ONE MORE LAP, BUT I COULDN'T MAKE  TWO MORE LAPS." AND AN AUTOPSY OF ONE  OF THE TIRES REVEALS EXACTLY WHY BRIAN'S GETAWAY  HIT A DEAD END. OOH. THIS LOOKS LIKE SOME  SPEED BUMP DAMAGE. YEAH.  I THINK THAT'S WHAT I FELT. WELL, THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM. [ LAUGHS ]  YEAH. THIS...  EVEN IF IT DIDN'T CRUMBLE, STILL NOT ENOUGH STRUCTURE  TO GO THAT FAR, BUT YOU COULD HAVE  DRIVEN ON THAT. YOU CAN'T DRIVE ON THAT. SO THE A/B FOAM TIRES GETS AN "E.F." GRADE  AS SPIKE-BUSTERS -- EPIC FAIL. TIME FOR A NEW SET OF TIRES. THE GUYS HAVE SETTLED  ON A HEAVYWEIGHT OPTION. YOU WANT TO START  MIXING CONCRETE WHILE I DRILL HOLES  IN THIS TIRE? YEAH.  THAT SOUNDS GOOD. BUT WILL CONCRETE-FILLED TIRES  DEAL A KNOCKOUT BLOW TO THE SPIKE STRIPS AND MAKE FOR A CLEAN GETAWAY? MOMENTUM! OH, YEAH. BOOP!  -ALL RIGHT, JON. CONCRETE TIRE HANDLING TEST  IN THREE, TWO, ONE. Jon: ALL RIGHT. HERE COMES MY VERY SLOW,  VERY DELIBERATE START. Narrator:  PROBABLY A SMART MOVE. WITH EACH CONCRETE TIRE  ADDING 180 POUNDS, THE WHEELS COULD EASILY  SHEER CLEAN OFF THE CAR. Jon: HOW'S IT LOOKING  FROM THE OUTSIDE? WELL, JON, GOT TO BE HONEST.  LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER'S DRIVING. SO WHILE OLD ROLLING THUNDER  MAKES HIS WAY TO THE HEIST... ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO, FIRST SPEED BUMP. ...THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME  TO CHECK BACK INTO THE MYTH  OF THE GEEZER GEYSER. ALL RIGHT. THE MYTHBUSTERS HAVE DISCOVERED HOW TO STABLY SUSPEND  A RUBBER BALL IN A JET OF WATER. Jon: OOH.  LOOK AT THAT! Brian: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL,  AND I THINK THAT MEANS THESE NOZZLES  ARE IMPORTANT. BUT CAN THEY PULL THE  SAME LEVITATIONAL TRICK... THAT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. ...ON SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE  LIKE THE DRUNKEN OLD GEEZER IN THE MYTH? TA-DA! SO ON THE DRUNKEN NIGHT,  HE HUNG OUT AND SAID, "I'M GOING TO SIT IN  A GIANT WATERMELON." YEAH.  HE'S DRUNK. OKAY. GAS IT A LITTLE. GAS IT A LITTLE. FEELS LIKE IT'S GOING TO TAKE THE WEIGHT. YOU READY? -YEAH.  -I'M GOING TO LET GO! OH, SNAP! THAT'S SOMETHING  RIGHT THERE. I THINK THIS ACTUALLY APPLIES  TO THIS MYTH REALLY WELL BECAUSE IF MINI  BUSTER WAS DRUNK, HE WOULDN'T HE HANGING  ON TO THAT, WOULD HE? I MEAN, HE LITERALLY JUST FELL OFF OF IT. I DON'T THINK A SINGLE NOZZLE  IS GOING TO CUT IT. THINK THERE'S  A FAIR AMOUNT OF PHYSICS AND ENGINEERING THAT'S  GOING TO HAVE TO BE DONE TO MAKE THIS WORK,  BUT I HAVE AN IDEA. Narrator:  THE MYTHBUSTERS ARE GOING TO REBUILD THE SMALL-SCALE FOUNTAIN WITH AN ARRAY OF JETS  ENCIRCLING A CENTRAL JET, TO BETTER REPLICATE THE VEGAS  FOUNTAIN IN THE MYTH. WHEW! AND THAT PROCESS STARTS  WITH A COMPLEX DESIGN. YOU KNOW, USUALLY SOME IDEAS  LOOK EASIER ON PAPER. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM. LET'S GO  BUILD THIS THING. -LET'S DO IT.  -ALL RIGHT. ♪♪ OOH, FANCY. AFTER YOU, SIR. ♪♪ HEY!  AHA! ALL RIGHT.  THIS LOOKS GOOD. LET'S SHUT IT DOWN,  TIGHTEN THOSE DOWN, AND TRY TO FLOAT BUSTER. COMING UP, THE GUYS GET SOME  EXPERT HELP FROM OLD PALS... I JUST LIKE HUGGING IT. TO UPSIZE  THEIR SMALL-SCALE FOUNTAIN TO VEGAS PROPORTIONS... All: WHOA!  ...AND... Jon: OKAY, HERE WE GO. Narrator: ...IT'S CONCRETE TIRES  VERSUS SPIKE STRIP, BUT WILL THIS  HEAVYWEIGHT DUEL... Jon: SPIKE STRIPS ENGAGE! Narrator: ...END IN A KNOCKOUT  OR A BLOWOUT? Jon: OH, YES! E MYTHBUSTERS ARE  Narrator: ...END IN A KNOCKOUT  INVESTIGATING A TALL TALE OF DRUNKEN MISADVENTURE  IN A WATER FEATURE. THE FIRST TIME WE TRIED  TO LEVITATE MINI BUSTER IN HIS INNER TUBE,  WE HAD A SINGLE NOZZLE WHICH RESULTED IN SOME  KIND OF INTERESTING LEAN ON THE INNER TUBE  WHERE HE FELL OUT. BUT NOW WE HAVE  AN ENTIRE ARRAY OF NOZZLES, WHICH I THINK WILL GIVE US  A PRETTY STABLE LEVITATION OF BUSTER  AND HIS MINI INNER TUBE. LET'S SAY WE START  WITH THE OUTSIDE RING FIRST. Brian:  SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. OH! THAT IS PRETTY COOL. IT SEEMED TO BE RIDING THE  OUTSIDE AND IT FELL RIGHT DOWN WHERE THAT CENTRAL NOZZLE  ISN'T FLOWING RIGHT NOW. SO WHAT I THINK  YOU'RE SAYING IS WE SHOULD TRY THIS WITH THE INNER NOZZLE. I THINK  IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA. -ALL RIGHT.  -ALL RIGHT. Narrator: FIRST, THEY'LL TRY  THE CENTER JET A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE OUTER ARRAY. IT'S STRAIGHT OVER  THE FALLS FOR BUSTER, BUT THE GUYS ARE GOING TO GIVE  THE INSIDE JET ANOTHER CHANCE. DOWN A SMIDGEN  ON THE INSIDE? YEAH, YOU THINK WE CAN GET TO  ABOUT 6 INCHES OR SO BELOW... YEAH. I CAN GET ANYTHING  YOU WANT, JON. THAT'S GETTING CLOSE, MAN. CLOSE, BUT NO HYDRAULICALLY  SUSPENDED CIGAR. MINI BUSTER'S JET RIDE LASTS  FOR LESS THAN A SECOND. THINK WE'D BENEFIT  FROM A SLIGHTLY MORE REALISTIC-WEIGHT  MINI BUSTER BECAUSE  HE'S PRETTY LIGHT. THEN WE PUT A FEW NUTS IN THERE,  TAPE HIM DOWN LIKE HE'S HANGING ON, JUST SO WE CAN FIND THAT BALANCE  POINT IN OUR SMALL-SCALE. BY MAKING MINI BUSTER HEAVIER, THE RATIO OF HIS WEIGHT  TO HIS RING'S WEIGHT WILL BE CLOSER TO TRUE SCALE. IT WILL ALSO LOWER  HIS CENTER OF GRAVITY, WHICH JON THINKS SHOULD  STABILIZE HIS RIDE IN THE JETS. OKAY. TO BALANCE THE INCREASED  DOWNWARDS FORCE, A BEEFED-UP BUSTER  WILL NOW EXERT... UP A LITTLE BIT.  OH, IT'S TOO HIGH. ...THE GUYS CRANK UP  THE OUTER ARRAY TO 10 FEET AND DROP THE INNER JET TO 5. -HOW FAR?  -THAT'S GOOD. ALL RIGHT. SO WILL THIS  WATERY CONFIGURATION RESULT IN LEVITATION? BUSTER, INTO A 10-FOOT TALL  OUTER ARRAY WITH HALF-HEIGHT INNER ARRAY  IN THREE, TWO, ONE! OH! [ LAUGHS ] OH! OH!  -WHAT DO YOU CALL THAT? LEVITATION! IT'S A PRETTY TURBULENT  JET RIDE FOR THE LITTLE GUY, BUT HE CLINGS ON TO HIS RING  FOR THE DURATION. AND CLOCKING A TOTAL FLIGHT TIME  OF 7 SECONDS, THIS SMALL-SCALE TEST SUGGESTS THERE MAY YET BE  SOME TRUTH TO THE MYTH. -HOLY MOLY!  -RIGHT? SO I THINK THERE'S ONLY  ONE QUESTION NOW. YOU THINK THAT FOUNTAIN STILL WORKS WHEN IT'S UNDER THE WATER? YEAH. HOW DID BUSTER FLOAT  ON TOP OF THAT? WE JUST SAW A PRETTY GOOD  LEVITATION OF OUR MINI BUSTER IN HIS MINI INNER TUBE. BUT THE MYTH DOES STATE  THAT OUR OLD GEEZER DOES FLOAT ACCIDENTALLY INTO  A BUNCH OF FOUNTAINHEADS AND THEN GETS LIFTED UPWARDS. SO OUR NEXT STEP IS TO DROP OUR  NOZZLE ARRAY DOWN UNDER THE WATER AND SEE  IF WE CAN GET THE SAME RESULT. BUSTER IS IN POSITION. GO AHEAD AND FIRE IT  IN THREE, TWO, ONE! [ LAUGHS ] THAT LOOKS DIFFERENT. MORE LIKE A WAVE POOL THAN A BEAUTIFUL FOUNTAIN. THE STUFF IS RAINING BACK DOWN,  IT'S RIPPLING OUT AND THE RIPPLES  ARE COMING BACK IN, AND SO WE'RE GETTING  INTERMITTENT FLOW WHEN THE NOZZLE  IS ABOVE WATER -YOU READY?  -YEAH. NOW! -PRETTY! NOPE! PRETTY! NOPE!  -NOW! NOW! NOW! PRETTY! OKAY. SO, PROBLEM? I THINK WE SHOULD TRY THIS  IN A BIGGER POOL SO THAT THERE'S  LESS SPLASH AND THEN WE CAN TRY  WITH FULL-SIZED NOZZLES? TEXAS-SIZED FOUNTAIN? I LIKE THAT. WELL, IF IT'S  A TEXAS-SIZED FOUNTAIN, WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET  A TEXAS-SIZED CREW. OOH.  TAMARA AND ALLEN? I LIKE  THE WAY YOU THINK. GO GIVE THEM A CALL! STILL TO COME...BRIAN AND JON  HIT THE ROAD WITH OLD FRIENDS TO FIND A FULL-SIZE POOL... HA! AAH! ...AND GIVE THEIR SMALL-SCALE  FOUNTAIN A TEXAS-SIZED UPGRADE. AND JON IS IN FOR A WILD RIDE AS HE ATTEMPTS TO BEAT  A SPIKE STRIP... Brian:  OH, HE IS LOSING IT. YEP. ...AND MAKE A CLEAN GETAWAY. Jon: WHOO! SAVED THE CAMERA,  YOU'RE WELCOME! E MYTHBUSTERS ARE ATTEMPTING  TO FOIL A POLICE SPIKE STRIP AND MAKE A SUCCESSFUL GETAWAY  USING DIY-TOUGHENED TIRES. BUT THEIR FIRST EFFORT WITH A/B FOAM-FILLED TIRES FELL FLAT. Jon:  YOU HEAR THAT, BRIAN? THAT'S THE SOUND OF US  GOING TO PRISON. [ LAUGHS ] NOW THE GUYS HAVE SWITCHED  TO CONCRETE-FILLED TIRES, ADDING 740 POUNDS  TO THE WEIGHT OF THE CAR. BUT WHILE THE GOING  IS SLOW ON THE WAY TO THE MYTHBUSTERS'  IMAGINARY HEIST, THE WEIGHTY WHEELS  ARE HANDLING WELL. Brian:  THE TIRES ARE AWFULLY STIFF, BUT THE SUSPENSION IS  DOING ITS JOB. IT DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD. JON: A little limber towards the end when I picked up speed, BUT OTHER THAN THAT,  IT DRIVES FINE. YOU WANT TO TURN AROUND  AND GO FOR THE GOLD? You know I do. TIME FOR A SHARP EXIT  FROM THE SCENE OF THE CRIME. SO WILL THE CONCRETE TIRES  SURVIVE THE SPIKES AND A SPEEDY GETAWAY? SPIKE STRIPS ENGAGE! OH! I MEAN, I HEARD SOMETHING BUT I AIN'T STOPPING. OH, YEAH.  HERE WE GO. OOH, I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE I'M NOT REALLY IN CONTROL. WHOO! SAVED THE CAMERA,  YOU'RE WELCOME! YOU'RE WELCOME! OH, OH, OH! GOING AROUND  FOR ANOTHER LAP? OH, GOT THAT  SPIKE STRIP AGAIN. WHOO! OH, HE IS LOSING IT. YEP. OH! THAT'S NOT  A SEXY RIDE AT ALL. IT'S GETTING PRETTY CRAZY. MAYBE IT'S GOING TO BE  MY LAST LAP. COPY THAT, JON. HERE WE GO! OH, WE'RE STILL GOOD, CAMERA! AND HERE WE GO. AAH! ♪♪ WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT THAT, MR. NEW YORK DRIVER? IF YOU'RE GOING  AT 25 MILES AN HOUR, YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL  OF THE CAR. YOU GO 35 MILES AN HOUR  AND THEN THE ENTIRE THING IS JUST YOU GOING LIKE  THIS DOWN THE STREET. SO I'M NOT PERFECTLY  EDUCATED ON IT, BUT WHAT'S THE TOP SPEED  OF A POLICE CAR? I'M PRETTY SURE  SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN 35 MILES AN HOUR. EVEN THOUGH  THE CONCRETE-FILLED TIRES NOT ONLY SURVIVED  THE SPIKE STRIP BUT ALMOST RIPPED IT IN HALF, THEIR ADDED WEIGHT  AND LACK OF TRACTION ALSO DESTROYED  THE CAR'S HANDLING. SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE THE  END OF THE ROAD FOR THIS MYTH. DIY TIRES VERSUS SPIKE STRIPS. WELL, THE CONCRETE TIRES  ROLLED RIGHT OVER THE SPIKES AND NEARLY CUT  THE STRIP IN TWO. YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT AFTER YOU GOT UP TO SOME SPEED? YEAH.  AFTER THAT, NOT SO MUCH. I MEAN, ANYTHING OVER  35 MILES AN HOUR, YOU CAN'T  CONTROL THE CAR. THERE'S NO WAY  YOU'RE ESCAPING THE LAW. AND THEN THERE'S THE A/B FOAM-FILLED TIRES. ONCE THE SPIKES  DID THEIR WORK AND THERE WAS  NO AIR LEFT IN THE TIRES, IT COULDN'T  GET OVER THE OBSTACLES. YEP, DESTROYED BY THE WEIGHT OF THE CAR AND THE BUMPS IN THE ROAD  IN UNDER A MINUTE. SO CONCRETE TIRES, BUSTED. AND A/B FOAM-FILLED  TIRES, BUSTED. [ AIR HISSING ] BUT THE MYTHBUSTERS HAVEN'T  GIVEN UP ON GETTING AWAY JUST YET. COMING UP,  A SECOND SPIKE-BUSTING MYTH. CAN A HOLLYWOOD SKID  SKIP THE STRIP? BUT NOW IT'S BACK TO THE MYTH  OF THE GEEZER GEYSER AND HQ, WHERE BRIAN AND JON HAVE  ENLISTED THE HELP OF OLD PALS FROM "THE SEARCH,"  TAMARA ROBERTSON AND ALLEN PAN. SO GEEZER GEYSER,  NEXT STEPS? SO WE'VE DONE  THE SMALL-SCALE. WE TRIED ONE NOZZLE  AND AN ARRAY OF NOZZLES. BUT WHAT WE GOT TO  WAS THE POINT WHERE OUR SMALL POOL  WAS CAUSING WAVES TO CRASH BACK OVER THE NOZZLE,  INTERRUPTING THAT STREAM. SOUNDS LIKE WE NEED  A BIGGER POOL. LUCKILY WE HAVE ONE. YEAH, BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT BIGGER POOL, WE HAVE TO BUILD  ALL OF THIS. WHAT IS THIS? WE'VE GOT ARRAYS, OUTER AND  INNER, MANIFOLDS, AND SCAFFOLDING THAT LETS US  ADJUST EVERYTHING SO WE CAN TRY TO FLOAT  BUSTER ALL THE WAY UP. OOH, YOU WANT TO  BUILD THE SCAFFOLD? OOH, YEAH. -SO, PLUMBING?  -YEAH, SOUNDS GOOD. Jon: OKAY. ALL RIGHT. RIGHT NOW JON AND I --  HI, JON! HI, ALLEN! ARE USING PERFORATED  C-CHANNEL TO BUILD  A SCAFFOLDING SYSTEM TO HOLD OUR  MIDDLE NOZZLES IN PLACE AND KEEP OUR OUTER  NOZZLES ADJUSTABLE SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY  DIAL IN THE STREAMS TO GIVE BUSTER  THE BEST POSSIBLE CHANCE OF ACTUALLY BEING SHOT UP  AND SUSPENDED WITH WATER. BRIAN AND I ARE WORKING ON OUR WATER DISTRIBUTION MANIFOLDS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO OF THEM THAT ARE FED BY THREE PUMPS. THAT WILL GIVE US ENOUGH PRESSURE FOR THE OUTER AND THE INNER ARRAYS  FOR OUR NOZZLES. Brian: TAMARA AND I HAVE TO  SPEND A LOT OF TIME MAKING SURE EVERY  CONNECTION HERE IS RIGHT. I JUST LIKE HUGGING IT. WE'RE NOT DEALING  WITH A TON OF PRESSURE. I MEAN, IT'S A FAIR AMOUNT,  BUT NOT INSANE. IT'S A TON OF WATER. EACH OF OUR PUMPS CAN HANDLE  ABOUT 900 GALLONS PER MINUTE OF WATER. ANY LITTLE LEAK,  AND ONE OF THOSE NOZZLES MIGHT NOT BE RIGHT, NO FLYING  BUSTER. Narrator: IT'S A DEMANDING...  [ GROANS ] ...AND COMPLEX BUILD. BUT AFTER SOME SERIOUS  NUMBER CRUNCHING... Jon:  SO IT'S 2x SQUARED EQUALS 18. OH, ACTUALLY, THAT'S A PRETTY SMART WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAT. Narrator: ...AND SOME  NOT-SO-SERIOUS PLUMBING... NOW THE FOUNTAIN GODS  WILL HONOR US. ...THE SCAFFOLDING AND PIPEWORK FOR A VEGAS-SIZED  FOUNTAIN ARE COMPLETE. COOL. LOOKS LIKE WE GOT ALL THE PIECES. WHY DON'T WE BRING THEM OUT THERE AND PUT THEM TOGETHER? LET'S DO IT! BUT YOU CAN'T JUST BUILD  A SUPER FOUNTAIN ANYWHERE. TIME FOR A DRIVE OUT  TO THE COUNTRY, WHERE THE MYTHBUSTERS HAVE TEED UP A LOCATION FOR FINAL TESTING. OH, THAT'S  A NICE-LOOKING POOL. YEAH, IT REMINDS ME OF WHEN I  WAS A KID GOING TO SUMMER CAMP. YOU WENT TO SUMMER CAMP? NOPE, TOO MANY ALLERGIES,  COULDN'T GO. Narrator:  WITH SUMMER LONG GONE, THE POOL IS DESERTED  AND THE PERFECT SPOT TO BUILD A FOUNTAIN  OF VEGAS PROPORTIONS. ALL RIGHT. THE FOUNTAIN'S INNER JET ARRAY WILL BE POWERED BY A SINGLE PUMP WHILE THE OUTER ARRAY  CAN TAKE EITHER ONE OR TWO. CLEAR! SO THE MYTHBUSTERS HAVE ORDERED  IN TWO LARGE UNITS AND ONE VERY LARGE UNIT, WHICH THEY'LL USE  IN DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS. THREE MASSIVE PUMPS  IN PLACE. WHILE TAMARA GETS TO GRIPS  WITH THE OVERSIZED PIPEWORK AND BRIAN SUPERVISES... [ GROANS ] OH, THAT'S USING EVERYTHING YOU'VE GOT. ALL RIGHT. ...JON AND ALLEN  MAKE A START IN THE POOL. OOH! SO HOPEFULLY JON IS NOT  ALLERGIC TO COLD WATER. AHH! Tamara: SO THIS IS A PRETTY  BIG BUILD IN ITSELF, BUT ADD ANY ELEMENT OF WATER  AND IT GETS EVEN MORE INTENSE. -IT'S COLD!  -IT IS COLD. EVERYTHING THAT YOU'RE DOING  IS ACTUALLY JUST ZAPPING THE ENERGY AND HEAT OUT OF YOU. TOO FAR AWAY. I CAN COME OVER,  WHATEVER YOU NEED. YOUR HANDS START TO CRAMP UP,  WHICH TAKES YOU LONGER TO ACTUALLY SCREW EVERYTHING IN, WHICH THEN MEANS THAT YOU'RE  IN THE COLD WATER EVEN LONGER, GETTING COLDER, TAKING LONGER,  GETTING COLDER, TAKING LONGER. IT'S A PROCESS,  BUT WE'RE ALMOST DONE. ALL RIGHT. THAT LAST HOSE IS ATTACHED. READY TO TEST  THE CENTER MANIFOLD? YEAH, BEFORE WE HOOK  THE REST OF IT UP AND SEE IF IT  ALL EXPLODES APART? YEAH.  LET'S DO IT. YEAH! HA! I CAN'T FEEL MY FOOT.  IS THAT BAD? YEAH. Narrator: BRIAN AND JON  DEVELOPED THE FOUNTAIN'S DESIGN DURING SMALL-SCALE TESTING  TO PROVIDE THE BEST SHOT AT LEVITATING BUSTER  AND HIS RING, BUT WITH A COMBINED  MAXIMUM OUTPUT OF 3,000 GALLONS PER MINUTE,  THESE PUMPS ARE BIG-LEAGUE, AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT  MYTHBUSTERS' SCALED-UP FOUNTAIN WILL HANDLE SUCH MASSIVE FORCE. WELL, THERE'S ONLY  ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. -WELL, I'M READY.  -ON YOUR MARK. CENTER MANIFOLD INTEGRITY TEST  IN THREE, TWO, ONE! [ ENGINE STARTS ] A LITTLE BIT. Narrator: FIRST, BRIAN WILL FIRE  THE INNER ARRAY HOOKED UP TO ONE  OF THE LARGE PUMPS. SO FAR, SO GOOD. YAY! BUT NEXT, THE REAL TEST -- BOTH  ARRAYS FIRING SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE OUTER JETS HOOKED UP  TO THE EXTRA LARGE PUMP. WHOA!  YAY! THAT'S AWESOME. LOOK AT THAT! THE FOUNTAIN REMAINS INTACT, AND EVEN WITH THE BIGGER PUMP  BACKED OFF FULL CAPACITY, THE OUTER JETS REACH  AROUND 60 FEET IN THE AIR. DEFINITELY ENOUGH FORCE TO PUSH AND HOLD BUSTER UP. YOU THINK?  YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: AND COMING UP NEXT... GO, GO, GO, GO,  GO, GO, GO! COME ON! ...IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT. Narrator: THE MYTHBUSTERS HAVE  PUT THEIR SUPER FOUNTAIN TO THE TEST,  AND THE RESPONSE WAS GUSHING. OH! BUT ARE ITS POWERFUL JETS  CAPABLE OF SUSPENDING A DRUNKEN OLD GUY  IN AN INFLATABLE RING AS CLAIMED IN THE MYTH? ACCORDING TO THIS MYTH,  THIS GEEZER HAS TO FLOAT EXACTLY ON TOP OF A FOUNTAIN  RIGHT WHEN IT GOES OFF. TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS,  ME, JON, AND TAMARA ARE GOING TO BE GUIDING  THE FLOAT WITH THESE LINES. Narrator: BUT FOR INITIAL TESTING THERE WILL BE NO BUSTER, JUST HIS INFLATABLE RING, AND THE MYTHBUSTERS  WILL START SMALL, FIRING ONLY THE OUTER JETS POWERED BY ONE  OF THE LARGE PUMPS. IN THREE, TWO, ONE! ALL RIGHT, LET IT GO!  GO, GO, GO, GO, GO! COME ON, BABY! BUT EVEN WITH THE LARGE PUMP  AT CLOSE TO FULL POWER, THE OUTER JETS FAIL TO LIFT  THE INFLATABLE RING. WHAT IF WE TRAPPED IT  WITH THE OUTER LIKE THAT AND THEN ACTUALLY USE  THE CENTER TO START RAISING IT? -SO USE BOTH SETS OF PUMPS?  -YEP. Brian: SO I'LL BRING UP THE POWER ON THE OUTER ARRAY, TOO, TO LOCK IT WELL IN. COPY THAT.  ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT. ALL RIGHT.  LET IT GO. COME ON. OH! THE INNER JETS DID  PROVIDE EXTRA LIFT, BUT NOT THE SUSTAINED  STABLE SUSPENSION DESCRIBED IN THE MYTH. DO YOU THINK THE WEIGHT  OF BUSTER WOULD HELP? LET'S THROW BUSTER  IN THERE. IN EARLIER PHASES OF TESTING, A  REALISTIC SCALE AND WEIGHT MINI BUSTER WITH  A LOWER CENTER OF GRAVITY WAS CRITICAL  TO SUCCESSFUL LEVITATION. SO COULD THE ADDITION OF THIS  GUY MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE? THIS GUY HAS GOT TO GET THAT PARTYING UNDER CONTROL. YEAH, I THINK HE HAD A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH TO DRINK THIS TIME. AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO SOBER UP THAN WITH A RELAXING FLOAT  IN A SUPER FOUNTAIN? AFTER A BUNCH OF PRELIMINARY  TESTS TO HONE IN EVERYTHING, I THINK WE'RE READY  TO GO FULL-SCALE. THAT MEANS  BOTH ARRAY OF NOZZLES, FULL-SIZE INNER TUBE,  AND FULL-SIZE BUSTER. I THINK HE'S GOING TO GO  PRETTY HIGH UP, SINCE WE GOT THAT  GOOD STABILIZING OUTER RING AND A PRETTY POWERFUL  INNER ARRAY. Narrator: Well, there's only  one way to find out -- HIT THE JETS, TEX! Jon: OH, MY GOD! ♪♪ [ ALL SHOUTING ] ♪♪ MUCH LIKE THE PREVIOUS TEST, THE FOUNTAIN TIPS  THE INFLATABLE RING AND DRUNKEN BUSTER TUMBLES  INTO THE TURBULENCE. WE CAME UP PRETTY HIGH ON THAT OUTSIDE NOZZLE, RIGHT, AND ALMOST ALL THE WAY  ON THE INSIDE ONE JUST TO GET  THAT TO HAPPEN. -YEAH.  -I THINK WE NEED TO GO BACK TO THAT BIGGER PUMP ON THAT OUTSIDE NOZZLE, RIGHT? WHOO! ALL RIGHT.  LET'S GET SET UP. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, TAMARA!  GET OUT OF THERE! LET GO! Narrator: WITH THE EXTRA-LARGE  PUMP HOOKED UP TO THE OUTER JETS, THEY KICK OUT  A WHOLE LOT MORE JUICE, BUT WILL THEY HOLD BUSTER  STEADY ENOUGH FOR THE INNER JETS TO LIFT HIM! OH! IS THAT IT? Brian:  THAT IS EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT ON THE OUTER ARRAY RIGHT NOW. Narrator: AND STILL  NO FOUNTAIN FLIGHT FOR BUSTER. JON HAS A THEORY WHY. EVERY TIME WE SEE OLD MAN BUSTER ALMOST GET LIFTED BY THE CENTER ARRAY,  HE FLIPS FEET OVER HEAD. NOW, THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S HEAVIER  IN THE CHEST THAN HIS LEGS ARE, JUST LIKE A NORMAL  HUMAN BEING IS. Narrator: WHEN THE SMALL-SCALE  FOUNTAIN SUCCESSFULLY SUSPENDED MINI BUSTER, JON HAD FIRST  CAREFULLY BALANCED THE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION  IN HIS RING. BUT AS AN OLD DUDE SITTING  IN AN INFLATABLE RING WOULD BE IMBALANCED,  JUST LIKE BUSTER, USING COUNTER WEIGHTS  TO EVEN THINGS OUT WOULD BE CHEATING THE MYTH. SO THE MYTHBUSTERS INSTEAD  DECIDE TO BOTH RECONFIGURE THE FOUNTAIN  AND HOOK IT UP TO ALL THREE PUMPS  TO ATTEMPT TO LIFT BUSTER ONE LAST TIME. FOR THIS FINAL SHOT,  WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE  OUR INNER ARRAY OUT CLOSER TO OUR OUTER ARRAY, SO THAT ALL OF OUR PUMPS  ARE FOCUSING ALL OF OUR FORCE ON THE OUTER PART, WHICH SHOULD GIVE US THE MOST  STABILITY AND THE MOST FORCE, AND MAYBE BUSTER WILL  ACTUALLY STAY UP THERE. ALL RIGHT.  YOU GUYS READY? All: YEAH! ALL RIGHT. THIS IS THE BIG ONE.  IN THREE, TWO, ONE! Narrator: THIS IS THE FINAL CALL  FOR DRUNKEN BUSTER. WILL HE MAKE HIS FLIGHT  OR GET DITCHED IN THE DRINK TO DROWN HIS SORROWS? OH, YEAH!  LET'S GO! GO, GO,  GO, GO, GO, GO, GO! COME ON! COME ON. COME ON!  COME ON! GO! GO! GO! ♪♪ I THINK WE MAXED OUT. -THAT DIDN'T WORK AT ALL.  -NO, IT DIDN'T. Jon:  LOOK AT ALL THE STUFF WE DID  FOR THIS FULL-SCALE TEST TODAY. WE JUST FIRED  THE OUTER ARRAY... COME ON, BABY! ...WE FIRED BOTH  ARRAYS TOGETHER. WE USED ALL THE PUMPS,  EVEN ARRANGED THE INNER NOZZLES OUTSIDE TO CREATE SOME  SUPER RING OF NOZZLES AND IT STILL DIDN'T WORK. WE DEFINITELY MASTERED  CAGING BUSTER, BUT LEVITATION,  NOT SO MUCH. YEAH, EVEN WHEN WE SAW  BUSTER START TO LIFT A LITTLE ABOVE  THE SURFACE OF THE WATER, HE WOULD JUST FLIP OVER  LIKE A PANCAKE. I'VE GOT TO SAY,  THIS IS BUSTED. -BUSTED.  -AGREED.  -AGREED. Narrator: STILL TO COME... BRIAN, YOU READY? I WAS BORN READY! ...GET READY FOR SPIKE-BUSTING  MYTH NUMBER TWO, THE HOLLYWOOD POWER SLIDE. Narrator: WHEN THE MYTHBUSTERS  TESTED IF DIY-TOUGHENED TIRES COULD BEAT POLICE  ROAD SPIKES... Jon: OOH! I CAN HEAR THE AIR  LEAVING THOSE TIRES. ...THE MYTH ENDED UP  AS BUSTED AS THE TIRES. BUT WHAT IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY  TO BEAT A SPIKE STRIP? WELL, ACCORDING TO THE MOVIE  "BABY DRIVER," THERE IS. ALL YOU NEED IS  A HIGH-POWERED CAR, A SKILLED DRIVER  WITH NERVES OF STEEL, AND YOU CAN DRIFT THOSE SPIKES  CLEAN OFF THE ROAD, THEN ESCAPE TO FREEDOM. USING ONE OF OUR REAR TIRES  TO BRUSH ASIDE A SPIKE STRIP IS SORT OF LIKE TRYING TO DO  SURGERY WITH A SLEDGEHAMMER BECAUSE WE'RE USING  A FULL-SIZED VEHICLE TO BRUSH ASIDE SOMETHING THAT'S  ABOUT THIS TALL AND THIS WIDE. TO GET THIS RIGHT,  WE NEED PERFECT TIMING AND A WHOLE LOT  OF COORDINATION. Narrator: AND THAT SOUNDS LIKE  A WHOLE BUNDLE OF BRIAN BABY. THE MYTHBUSTERS' VERY OWN  TRAINEE STUNT DRIVER WILL GET EXPERT COACHING FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT PURSUIT  AND EVASION DRIVING INSTRUCTOR, MARCUS SMITH. ALL RIGHT, FIRST THING IS A PRECISION MOVE. YOU HAVE TO GET THE BACK END  TO ROTATE IN AN OVERSTEER SKID. THE PROBLEM IS IF YOU DON'T  ROTATE ENOUGH, YOU GET A SPIKE. IF YOU ROTATE TOO MUCH, THE CAR IS GOING TO BE FACING  IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. LET'S DO IT. BEFORE BRIAN GETS A RUN  AT THE SPIKES, HE'LL HONE HIS TECHNIQUE  ON A SOFTER TARGET. OKAY.  THE TRACK IS CLEAR. COPY THAT, READY TO GO. Jon: OH, BOY. HERE WE GO. OOH, BRIAN. SWING AND A MISS, MAN. OOH, SO CLOSE! OOH, THAT WAS A GOOD ONE. ROTATION WAS GOOD. MAYBE RECOVERED JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO EARLY. Narrator: WHAT IS NEEDED IS  A LITTLE LESS CAUTION AND A LITTLE MORE  APPROACH SPEED. ♪♪ WHOA! NICE. NOT TO MIX MY SPORTS  METAPHORS, BUT BULL'S-EYE! THIS TIME, BRIAN CLIPS  THE BOXES, BUT DOES HE REALLY NAIL  THE MANEUVER? PERFECT PLACEMENT. Brian: I FEEL LIKE, THOUGH,  NOT QUITE ENOUGH ROTATION. THE TIRE PLACEMENT  WAS SPOT-ON. AND YOU WANT TO LEAD WITH THE REAR, NOT THE FRONT OF THE CAR. RIGHT, SO PLUS FOR ME  IS TIRE PLACEMENT. DOWNSIDE FOR ME  IS NOT QUITE ENOUGH ROTATION. SO IF BRIAN IS GOING TO  BEAT THE SPIKE STRIP, HE'LL NEED TO COMMIT  EVEN MORE TO THE POWER SLIDE. Jon: OKAY. IT'S TIME FOR THE REAL THING. HOW DO YOU THINK  HE'S GOING TO DO? I ACTUALLY THINK HE'S GOING  TO DO A GOOD JOB, BUT I'M ROOTING  FOR THE SPIKE STRIP. I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM. ALL RIGHT.  LET'S CALL HIM IN. THREE, TWO, ONE. AND HE'S OFF. ♪♪ DON'T MOVE YOUR CAR,  BRIAN. Brian: YEAH.  I CAN'T SEE THE SPIKE STRIPS, SO I THOUGHT I WOULD  JUST HANG OUT HERE. Narrator: AMAZINGLY,  ALL THE TIRES SURVIVE INTACT, BUT THE SPIKE STRIP IS WRAPPED  AROUND BOTH BACK WHEELS, IMMOBILIZING THE CAR. SO WHAT WENT WRONG? Brian: OH, THAT'S SIDEWAYS. BRIAN NAILS THE MANEUVER,  SLIDING THE SIDE WALL OF HIS REAR TIRE INTO THE STRIP, BUT HE STILL FAILS  TO BEAT THE SPIKES. Jon: YEAH, YOU'RE HITTING REAL  NICE SIDEWAYS, BUT YOU HIT IT RIGHT  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STRIP. Smith:  A LITTLE BIT OFF. EXACTLY, WHICH MAKES YOUR  GETAWAY A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT, I'M GOING TO SAY.  -YEAH. I DON'T THINK I COULD  HAVE GONE ANYWHERE. BUT THERE'S A CHANCE, I THINK,  IF I HIT IT CLOSER TO THE EDGE, THAT WOULD GO DIFFERENTLY, HUH?  -YEAH. GOOD THING YOU DIDN'T POP  ANY OF THOSE TIRES. YOU WANT TO HOP BACK IN  AND GIVE IT ANOTHER GO? NO. [ SCOFFS ] BRIAN, YOU READY? I WAS BORN READY! OOH, HE'S GOT THE REV. I THINK HE FORGOT TO TAKE IT OUT OF PARK. ♪♪ NICE.  THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THIS MYTH. NO, SIR, IT IS NOT. Narrator: EVEN THOUGH BRIAN  SLIDES IN PERFECTLY SIDEWAYS AND HITS THE VERY END  OF THE STRIP, JUST LIKE IN "BABY DRIVER," MULTIPLE SPIKES BITE  INTO THE TIRE. Jon: I THINK  THEY CAUGHT YOU, MAN. Brian: YEAH, I WAS A LITTLE SCARED TO KEEP GOING. IT'S WEIRD. IT'S LIKE THESE  SPIKE STRIPS JUST WERE DESIGNED TO STOP CARS  NO MATTER WHAT THEY DID. AS THOUGH YEARS OF ENGINEERING  AND REHEARSAL AND TRIAL AND ERROR HAVE CAUSED THIS  TO WORK SO WELL. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE  THE SHARPEST SPIKE IN THE STRIP TO WORK OUT THE VERDICT  ON THIS MOVIE MYTH. SO BEATING A SPIKE STRIP  WITH A POWER SLIDE, I MEAN, IT SEEMS PRETTY EASY IN THE MOVIES. YEAH, BUT EVEN WITH BRIAN BABY  BEHIND THE WHEEL, NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE  IN REAL LIFE. YEAH, YOU HAVE TO GET THE ROTATION OF THAT SLIDE JUST RIGHT TO BRUSH THE SPIKE STRIP BUT NOT ROLL OVER IT. NOT EASY, AND YOU HAVE TO HIT THE VERY END OF THAT SPIKE STRIP WITH A TIRE TO HAVE A CHANCE  OF BRUSHING IT AWAY. ALSO NOT EASY. EVEN IF YOU GET THE ACCURACY  AND THE ROTATION OF THAT POWER SLIDE RIGHT, YOU END UP WITH SPIKES  IN YOUR TIRE. SO THIS MYTHICAL MOVE MIGHT WORK IN BLOCKBUSTERS BUT IN REAL LIFE IT'S JUST PLAIN BUSTED. JUST LIKE THOSE TIRES. SO, BRIAN BABY, YOU READY TO TRY TO MAKE ANOTHER GETAWAY? YEAH. NEVER GOING TO  CATCH ME, COPPER! [ IMITATES  WHEELS SQUEALING ] YEAH. YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO USE THE SPIKE STRIP THIS TIME, RIGHT? WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,  UNCOOL! [ SIREN WAILS ]
