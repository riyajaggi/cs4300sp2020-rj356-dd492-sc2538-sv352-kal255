 ¶¶ ¶¶ Narrator: ON THIS HIGH-VELOCITY EPISODE OF "MythBusters"... -WHOA! -Narrator: FIRST UP... LOOK, THERE'S SMOKE COMING OUT OF HIS PANTS. Narrator: A FABLED FORCEFUL EVICTION... BURGLAR TRIES TO ROB A HOUSE. AAH! WHOA. HE GETS STUCK IN THE CHIMNEY. OH, I SEE HIM STRUGGLING. ACTUALLY, THAT'S ME STRUGGLING. FAMILY COMES HOME.

 THEY DON'T KNOW HE'S IN THERE, AND THEN THEY IGNITE THE FIRE. AND THEN, BOOM, CRIMINAL BECOMES ROCKET MAN. [ EXPLOSION ] OH! [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: THEN A MYTHICAL MEETING OF CHAINSAW AND BULLET. [ WHIRRING AND BEEPING ] THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. [ GUNSHOT ] SOMEBODY SHOOTS A BULLET INTO A TREE. THERE SHE IS. AND THEN YEARS LATER, SOMEONE'S CUTTING INTO A TREE WITH A CHAINSAW, PULLS THE BULLET OUT, AND IT KILLS HIM. -[ MAKING WHIRRING SOUND ] -[ LAUGHS ] NOW! [ BUZZING ]

 Narrator: WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG? I MEAN, THIS IS QUINTESSENTIAL "MythBusters." YES! ¶¶ ¶¶ CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ¶¶ Narrator: OUR FIRST MYTH IS A CAUTIONARY TALE FOR ANY STANDARD-SIZED SANTA OR A CHUBBY CRIMINAL. THE STORY GOES THAT DURING A ROOFTOP BREAK-AND-ENTER, A HAPLESS BURGLAR GETS STUCK IN THE CHIMNEY. THE UNWITTING HOMEOWNERS LIGHT A PROPANE FIREPLACE THAT'S BEEN LEAKING GAS, AND, BOOM, THE WEDGED INTRUDER IS LAUNCHED LIKE A SKYROCKET. ¶¶ [ SIZZLING ] DUDE, THIS MYTH IS GONNA BE AWESOME. OH, YEAH. WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF THIS TO TEST THIS MYTH AND AN UNWILLING VOLUNTEER. PROPANE, NO PROBLEM. UNWILLING VOLUNTEER, UH... GOING TO HAVE TO WORK ON THAT. SO WHERE DO WE START? -STOICHIOMETRY. -RIGHT. OF COURSE. IT'S THE TRICKY BALANCE BETWEEN FUEL AND AIR THAT GIVES US THE BEST EXPLOSION. -A LITTLE TOO MUCH FUEL... -NO BOOM. -A LITTLE TOO MUCH AIR... -NO BOOM. BUT YOU GET THAT GOLDILOCKS MIXTURE JUST RIGHT... -BIG BOOM! -EXACTLY. LET'S START THERE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE PROPANE GO BOOM. ¶¶ Jon: ALLEGEDLY, THIS MYTH TAKES PLACE SOMEWHERE OUT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, SO THEY WERE PROBABLY NOT GETTING NATURAL GAS PROVIDED BY THE CITY. INSTEAD, THEY'RE USING PROPANE. IT'S THE EXPLOSIVE PROPERTIES OF THAT GAS THAT WE'LL BE TESTING. Narrator: THEY'VE GOT THE PROPANE. BUT TO FIRE A FELON SKY HIGH, THE GUYS NEED TO WORK OUT THE OPTIMAL EXPLOSIVE CONDITIONS. AND WITH SOME MORAL SUPPORT FROM MYTH DOG, BO, IT'S TIME TO FIND THE PERFECT STOICHIOMETRIC RATIO OF AIR AND FUEL. ¶¶ I FEEL LIKE I'M ROBBING A BANK. OH! BEND IT THERE. VOILà. WE'RE ABOUT TO FILL EACH ONE OF THOSE TUBES WITH A VERY SPECIFIC MIXTURE OF PROPANE AND AIR, THEN WE'RE GOING TO CAP IT OFF, WE'RE GOING TO IGNITE IT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE HOW HIGH IT TAKES THAT STOPPER. THEN WE'RE GOING TO MARK OFF EXACTLY HOW MUCH EACH PERCENTAGE CARRIED IT AND HOW HIGH. Narrator: MORE PROPANE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN A BIGGER BANG. SO THE FIRST TUBE IS 50%. Narrator: SO THEY'LL KICK OFF BY DOING 3 TESTS AT 50, 30 AND THEN 15% PROPANE MIXED WITH AIR. TO GET THE RATIOS RIGHT, THEY'VE COME UP WITH A SPLASHY SOLUTION. SCIENCE CAN BE QUITE BEAUTIFUL. ON MY COMMAND, BRIAN WILL UNLEASH PROPANE UP THIS LINE THAT LEADS TO OUR CYLINDER. THAT PROPANE WILL DISPLACE ALL THE WATER DOWN TO OUR MARK, WHICH WILL FILL OUT OF THIS WATER OUTLET TUBE INTO THIS BUCKET. THEN WE'LL HAVE THE EXACT AMOUNT OF PROPANE WE NEED FOR THE EXPERIMENT. AND RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT TAPE. -ALL RIGHT! -THAT'S PROPANE! LET'S GET AIR IN THE REST OF THIS. -READY? -YEAH. HERE WE GO. THEN WE'LL PLUMB IN COMPRESSED AIR, GET THE REST OF THE WATER LEVEL DOWN, AND WE'LL HAVE THE PERFECT MIX OF PROPANE TO AIR FOR OUR EXPERIMENT. AND WE'RE GOOD. SHUT OFF BOTH VALVES. WE HAVE OUR 50/50 MIX THAT'S 50% PROPANE AND 50% AIR READY TO GO. THAT MIX OF PROPANE AND AIR BACK THERE SEEMS KIND OF RICH. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO POP, BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE TESTING IT. 50% PROPANE TO 50% AIR. TEST IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ CLICK ] -TOO RICH. -TOO RICH. Narrator: JON WAS RIGHT. THE MAGIC MIX WAS DEFINITELY NOT HALF AND HALF. BUT BEFORE THE GUYS DIAL IT IN, THEY'RE READY TO RIP WITH TALL TALE NUMBER TWO. IT'S ANOTHER NOT-SO-URBAN MYTH THAT YOU MIGHT CALL A SHOT IN THE BARK. IT ALL STARTS WITH A HUNTER WHO MISSES HIS MARK. [ GUNSHOT ] THE STRAY BULLET STAYS LODGED IN THE TREE TRUNK UNTIL YEARS LATER, THE LOGGERS ROLL IN. CHAINSAW MEETS BURIED BULLET, WHICH BURSTS OUT AT LETHAL VELOCITY. IT'S A LUMBERJACK'S WORST NIGHTMARE. TO TEST THIS MYTH, WE'RE GOING TO NEED THREE THINGS. FIRST OFF, A LOG... OF COURSE, A BULLET... AND OUR WEAPON OF CHOICE -- THE CHAINSAW. BUT WHAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN RIGHT NOW IS THE SPEED THAT THESE TEETH MOVE AROUND. SO WE NEED TO LOOK AT HIGH SPEED AND DETERMINE WHAT DISTANCE IN WHAT AMOUNT OF TIME THESE TEETH ARE MOVING. Narrator: THE MYTH'S VERACITY RESTS ON VELOCITY. A TYPICAL HUNTING RIFLE HAS A MUZZLE VELOCITY OF AROUND 2,500 FEET PER SECOND. LET'S SEE HOW THE CHAINSAW STACKS UP. [ MAKING WHIRRING SOUNDS ] NORMALLY, WHEN WE CHECK HIGH SPEED, WE PUT THE HIGH SPEED SCALE BEHIND THE OBJECT WE'RE CHECKING. BUT IN THIS CASE, WE WANT TO SEE HOW FAST THIS TOOTH IS MOVING ON THIS BAR. SO THIS TIME, WE PUT THE HIGH SPEED SCALE DIRECTLY ON THE OBJECT. Narrator: IF JON'S GOING TO TURN LUMBERJACK, HE NEEDS TO DIG DEEP AND CHANNEL THE FLANNEL. YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD THERE, JON. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU CAN OPERATE A CHAINSAW NOW. WE'LL SEE. [ MOTOR STARTS ] ALL RIGHT! CHAINSAW HIGH-SPEED TEST IN THREE, TWO, ONE. GO! Narrator: JUST ONE BRIEF BURST AT MAXIMUM REVS. AND IT'S OFF TO CHECK THE HIGH SPEED. -YOU READY FOR THIS? -YEAH. LET'S GO. Narrator: BY TRACKING THE TOOTH THEY MARKED AGAINST THE SCALE, THEY NAIL DOWN THE SPEED. ABOUT 90 FEET PER SECOND. 90 FEET PER SECOND MIGHT NOT SOUND LIKE THAT MUCH WHEN WE'RE TALKING BULLETS. BUT IN OUR CASE, WE'RE TALKING A CHAINSAW HITTING A BULLET. [ BUZZING ] WITH THAT WEIGHT OF THE CHAIN, THE FLYWHEEL AND THE PISTON ALL BEHIND IT, THAT BULLET CAN EXIT, WHOOSH, WITH MUCH GREATER VELOCITY THAN THE CHAIN, AND THAT GIVES THIS MYTH A GOOD CHANCE. Narrator: YEP, 90 FEET PER SECOND DOESN'T COMPARE WITH A REAL RIFLE, BUT THE TRANSFER OF ENERGY FROM THE MASS OF THE CHAINSAW TO THE LIGHTWEIGHT BULLET MEANS IT COULD POTENTIALLY FLY MUCH FASTER. FAST ENOUGH TO BE FATAL? WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. RIG UP A SYSTEM TO TRY FROM A SAFE DISTANCE. -[ IMITATES WHIRRING SOUND ] -[ LAUGHS ] WE'RE ABOUT TO DO A PRELIMINARY TEST WITH CHAINSAW VERSUS BULLET. BUT TO DO THIS TEST PROPERLY, WE NEED THIS CHAINSAW TO LAND ON THAT BULLET EVERY SINGLE TIME IN THE SAME SPOT. WHAT WE NEED IS A RIG THAT IS REMOTE-CONTROLLED AND ROCK-SOLID. SO AS THAT CHAIN GOES THROUGH THAT LOG, WE HAVE A NICE STEADY CUT AND NO RISK TO OURSELVES. AND THERE IS JUST A CHAINSAW ON IT. COOL. IS THERE GOING TO BE, LIKE, A STOP ON IT? OH, YEAH. WE'RE PUTTING A STOP, SO WE'LL LOCK IT INTO, LIKE, THIS BEING THE KILL ZONE. LIKE...OKAY. Narrator: AND BEFORE YOU CAN YELL, "TIMBER," THEIR MECHANICAL LUMBERJACK IS PRIMED FOR ACTION. TO LET US THROTTLE OUR CHAINSAW FROM A SAFE DISTANCE, WE HAVE THIS RIG RIGHT HERE. THIS SITS ON TOP OF THE TRIGGER GUARD, HOLDS DOWN THE SAFETY. AND THEN, WITH THIS SPRING ATTACHED, WE CAN PULL OUR THROTTLE CABLE WHICH REVS OUR CHAINSAW. Narrator: BUT THE SAW NEEDS SOMETHING TO SINK ITS TEETH INTO. [ GROWLS ] Narrator: AND FOR A PROOF OF CONCEPT TEST, IT'S OVER TO OUR RESIDENT TEXAN CHAINSAW MASOCHIST. THIS IS MY BULLET SANDWICH. WHY? YOU'VE GOT TO FEED YOUR CHAINSAW SOMETHING, RIGHT? WE NEED TO KNOW HOW THE BULLET IS GOING TO EXIT THE RIG. ¶¶ ALL RIGHT. BRING ME THE SANDWICH. Narrator: THE CHAINSAW IS ATTACHED. -OKAY. THIS IS STABLE. -VERY NICE. Narrator: THEY TEST THE ALIGNMENT... THAT WORKS. Narrator: AND THE HIGH SPEED CAMERAS ARE READY TO ROLL. [ MOTOR REVVING ] YOU READY? ON MY GO? CHAINSAW VERSUS BULLET IN STYROFOAM IN THREE, TWO, ONE. HERE WE GO. [ MOTOR REVVING ] [ BLEEP ] ¶¶ ONE! GO! Narrator: JON AND BRIAN ARE TESTING THE FATAL FORESTRY FABLE OF A CHAINSAW AND AN EMBEDDED BULLET. [ MOTOR REVVING ] TO FIND OUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO THIS MYTH, THE GUYS HAVE SET UP A PROOF OF CONCEPT... HERE WE GO. ...WITH A STAND-IN STYROFOAM LOG AND A CLEAR PLASTIC VIEWING PANEL. THE THROTTLE JUST WORKS BEAUTIFULLY. WE'RE JUST REVVING IT. [ IMITATES REVVING SOUND ] [ BUZZING ] [ BLEEP ] [ BUZZING CONTINUES ] WHAT?! Narrator: THEY QUEUE UP THE HIGH SPEED, BUT THAT WAS LESS THAN IMPRESSIVE. OKAY. SO THE CHAINSAW CATCHES THE BULLET. BUT INSTEAD OF JUST THROWING IT OUT, IT GOES BOOP, BOOP, BOOP, BOOP AND THEN TUMBLES TO THE GROUND. Narrator: THE CHAINSAW MAKES CLEAN CONTACT, BUT THEN THE BULLET HAS NO CLEAR EXIT PATH. WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO KIND OF RETHINK THIS, AREN'T WE? -YEAH. LET'S GO DO THAT. -OKAY. Narrator: IF THIS IS GOING TO WORK, THE BULLET NEEDS TO BE POSITIONED RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE STYROFOAM LOG. SO TO GIVE IT THE BEST CHANCE, WE'VE REMOVED THIS PART, SO THAT WHEN THE TOOTH GRABS, HOPEFULLY IT WILL JUST... [ CLICKS TEETH ] SHOOT IT OUT. [ MOTOR REVVING ] -SET? -SET! CHAINSAW VERSUS BULLET TEST NUMBER TWO WITH OPEN CHANNEL IN THREE, TWO, ONE! [ BUZZING ] -YEAH! -OH! GOOD! HOLD! WAS I GOING CRAZY, OR DID I HEAR SOMETHING? NO, IT ABSOLUTELY HIT THE GLASS. [ LAUGHS ] YES! OKAY. SO WHAT JUST HAPPENED WITH THIS TEST? CHAINSAW COMES IN, THE TOOTH ENGAGES THE BULLET. BOOM, INTO THE WALL RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE. AT THIS POINT, WITH OUR SMALL SCALE TEST, IT ACTUALLY TURNS OUT OUR CHAINSAW CAN GRAB A BULLET AND THROW IT OUT PRETTY HARD. BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO RAMP IT UP WITH REAL BULLETS AND REAL TREES. Narrator: BUT BEFORE THEY LET LOOSE WITH LIVE AMMO, IT'S BACK TO THE PROPANE FIREPLACE FABLE, TO FIND OUT IF IT'S FEASIBLE TO TURN A CHIMNEY INTO A CANNON AND A BURGLAR INTO A CANNONBALL. 50% PROPANE TO 50% AIR TEST IN 3, 2, 1. -TOO RICH. -[ LAUGHS ] TOO RICH. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S NOT ENOUGH AIR FOR IT TO IGNITE. I'D SAY WE SHOULD MOVE ON TO 30%, AND THAT'S 30% PROPANE AND 70% AIR. ONCE AGAIN, THE PROPORTIONS ARE MEASURED OUT TO THE MILLILITER. STOICHIOMETRY TEST, 30% PROPANE, 70% AIR, IN THREE, TWO, ONE! [ CLICK ] -IT'S A BIT RICH, YEAH? -YEAH. AND YET AGAIN, 70% AIR, 30% PROPANE, NOT ENOUGH OXYGEN TO LET IT BURN. Narrator: BY NOW, THEY'RE FULLY EXPECTING FIREWORKS. 50% PROPANE. 85% AIR. ONE. [ CLICK ] Narrator: BUT IT'S ANOTHER BUST. I WAS READY TO CATCH THAT STOPPER. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: SO TO RAISE THEIR CHANCES, THEY LOWER THE PROPANE. 10% PROPANE IN 3, 2, 1. BOOM! OR NOT. Narrator: EVEN 10% WAS TOO RICH A MIX. YOU GOT AIR. Narrator: SO THE GUYS DIAL IT DOWN EVER SO SLIGHTLY TO 7. 7% PROPANE, 93% AIR IN 3, 2, 1. -BOOM. YES! -[ LAUGHS ] [ BOOM ] I'M GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER SIGH OF RELIEF. JUST... [ SIGHS ] AND ONE MORE. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] ¶¶ -YES! -[ LAUGHS ] STILL GOING UP. -OH, NO. -WOW. IT'S STILL GOING. -NO, IT'S STILL GOING. -IT'S SLOWING DOWN, THOUGH. -AND... -THAT'S IT. -THAT'S WHERE IT IS. -BEAUTIFUL. 7%. PERFECT. Narrator: OR IS IT? PERHAPS 5% PROPANE WORKS EVEN BETTER. -READY? -YEP. [ WHOOSH ] WHOA! BEAUTIFUL. AT JUST 5% PROPANE, THAT PUSHED OUR STOPPER CLEAR TO FILL UP THE LENGTH OF OUR HIGH-SPEED SCALE. THE FIRST CORK, AT JUST 7% PROPANE, WENT 19 FEET PER SECOND. THE SECOND CORK AT LESS PROPANE, THAT'S 5%, 30 FEET PER SECOND. THAT'S A LOT MORE ENERGY. -BEAUTIFUL. -THAT'S 3%. Narrator: AND JUST TO BE SURE THEY NAILED THAT GOLDILOCKS GAS MIX... 3% PROPANE. THAT'S RIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JUST 3% PROPANE TEST IN 3, 2, 1. [ BUTTON CLICKS, CRACKLE ] -TOO LEAN. -TOO LEAN. AND NOW WE'VE GONE A LITTLE TOO FAR IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. AT 3% PROPANE, THERE IS JUST NOT ENOUGH FUEL FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPEN IN THERE. SO WE HAVE OUR PERFECT PROPANE-TO-AIR RATIO. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO TEST THAT MIX IN A REAL RURAL CHIMNEY, A COUNTRY-STYLE FIREBOX. GOT TO MAKE SURE SHE'S AIRTIGHT. WHY? BECAUSE PROPANE IS HEAVIER THAN AIR, SO IT MIGHT COLLECT AT THE BOTTOM OF A FIREBOX AND AFFECT HOW THE FUEL AND AIR ACTUALLY MIX. AND THERE IS OUR CHIMNEY. READY? ENCLOSED EXPLOSION IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ EXPLOSION ] [ LAUGHS ] OH. [ WHOOSH, CRACKLE ] SO THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE STOICHIOMETRY OF THE FIRE VERSUS EXPLOSION THING. OUR IGNITER GOES OFF, AND YOU ACTUALLY SEE KIND OF A FLAME BURNING INSIDE. WELL, THAT'S NOT AN EXPLOSION. AS THAT FLAME USES UP SOME OF THE OXYGEN, RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM IN THAT FIREBOX, THAT MAGIC MOMENT HAPPENS. AND BOOM, WE ACTUALLY GET EXPLOSIVE STOICHIOMETRY. SO WHERE ARE WE NOW? WELL, WE JUST FIGURED OUT THAT OUR GOLDILOCKS RATIO WAS ABOUT 5% PROPANE AND 95% AIR. WE DISCOVERED A CHIMNEY WITH A BLOCKED FLUE WILL GIVE US A BEAUTIFUL, ENERGETIC EXPLOSION. THE NEXT STEP IS TO BUILD OUR FULL-SCALE CHIMNEY AND OUR FULL-SCALE FIREBOX. SO THAT WHEN OUR BURGLAR IS STUCK IN THERE, WE CAN INTRODUCE OUR MIXTURE AND HOPEFULLY IT WILL JUST SEND HIM SKY-HIGH. -YEAH. I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE. -YEAH. FULL-SCALE CHIMNEY, HERE WE COME. ¶¶ Narrator: TO SEE IF A MAN REALLY COULD BE ACCIDENTALLY LAUNCHED FROM A CHIMNEY... THREE, TWO, ONE. ...THE GUYS HAVE BEEN TESTING THE EXPLOSIVE POTENTIAL OF PROPANE. [ BOOMS ] -WHOA! -BEAUTIFUL. SO FAR, WE'VE DONE A BUNCH OF SMALL-SCALE TESTS THAT LET US KNOW WHAT THE PERFECT MIX OF PROPANE TO AIR IS AROUND 5% PROPANE AND 95% AIR. SO NEXT STEP, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND START BUILDING OUR FULL-SCALE FIREBOX AND OUR FULL-SCALE CHIMNEY. Narrator: THE TRICKIEST PART OF THE BUILD IS ASSEMBLING A FULL-SCALE CHIMNEY IN THE WORKSHOP. THE ANSWER -- MAKE THE SMOKESTACK IN SEGMENTS. THIS IS A FLUE TILE, AN EXTRUDED CLAY TILE THAT'S JUST ABOUT LIGHTING EVERY CHIMNEY OUT THERE. WE'VE GOT TO GLUE 12 OF THESE TOGETHER TO GET THE HEIGHT WE NEED. SO JUST A LITTLE TIP. I'M USING A POLYURETHANE-BASED CONSTRUCTION ADHESIVE. IT WORKS GREAT FOR THIS CLAY. BUT THAT CLAY IS REAL POROUS, SO A QUICK SPRITZ WITH WATER HELPS ACTIVATE THAT ADHESIVE. ¶¶ ONE DOWN. THREE TO GO. WHEN WE GET IN THE FIELD, WE'LL REMOVE SOME SUPPORT STRAPS, USE THE SAME FRAME, GLUE FOUR OF THESE MODULES TOGETHER, AND THAT'S HOW WE GET OUR WHOLE CHIMNEY. Narrator: IN THE MEANTIME, JON'S GETTING INTO SOME HEAVY METAL. [ CRACKLING ] THIS IS OUR FIREBOX. WELL, IT'S OUR FOOTPRINT OF THE FIREBOX FOR NOW. EVERYTHING THAT'S IN OUR CHIMNEY -- THE FLUE TILES, ALL THE STRUCTURE, ALL 12 FEET OF IT IS GOING TO BE SITTING ON TOP OF THIS BOX, SO IT NEEDS TO BE EXTRA STURDY. ¶¶ STARTING TO GET THE IDEA, RIGHT? DOOR IS HERE, CHIMNEY THERE, AND THEN, HOPEFULLY, WE FILL IT WITH GAS AND BOOM. Narrator: IN FACT, THERE IS JUST ONE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE MISSING, A VOLUNTEER TO PLUG THEIR CHIMNEY. YEAH. THAT'S NOT BAD. YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO NEED A HUMAN ANALOG. YEAH, BUSTER WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT GUY? [ EXPLOSION ] Narrator: MORE TO THE POINT, WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN TO THAT GUY? [ EXPLOSIONS ] AFTER MANY A GLORIOUS AND PAINFUL ADVENTURE... [ WHOOSHING ] WHOA! ...BUSTER MARK 1 WAS FINALLY TAGGED, "DO NOT RESUSCITATE." OH. YEAH. POOR GUY. I WISH WE COULD GET A NEW BUSTER. IF ONLY THERE WAS A WAY. [ DOG WHINING ] LOOK! BO, HIT IT! [ ALARM SOUNDING ] Narrator: MANUFACTURED IN A TOP SECRET LOCATION, MADE FROM COURAGE, GRIT, AND STATE-OF-THE-ART MATERIALS, MEET BUSTER: THE NEXT GENERATION. ¶¶ Female automated voice: ALL SYSTEMS READY. ¶¶ EAGLE TO TOWER. BUSTER IS IN TRANSIT. [ ENGINES WHIRRING ] APPROACHING DROP ZONE. PACKAGES AWAY. WE HAVE A SITUATION. PARACHUTE HAS MALFUNCTIONED. [ ALARM SOUNDING ] ¶¶ LET'S SEE IF WE CAN PUT HIM BACK TOGETHER. Narrator: BEFORE BUSTER EVEN BEGINS DAY 1, HE'S OFF TO REHAB. ¶¶ SO THE BOYS HAVE SOME FREE TIME TO TAKE TO THE WOODS AND REKINDLE THE MYTH OF THE LETHAL CHAINSAW BULLET. REMEMBER, OUR MYTH IS ABOUT A HUNTING BULLET BEING LODGED IN A TREE. OUR WEAPON OF CHOICE -- THE WORLD WAR II RUSSIAN MOSIN-NAGANT. THE REASON IS, SO MANY WERE PRODUCED DURING WORLD WAR II, THAT THIS BECAME A COMMON HUNTING RIFLE AT THE END OF THE WAR. Jon: JUST REMEMBER, IN THE MYTH, THE GUY FIRES IT INTO A LIVE TREE. SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOOT A BUNCH OF BULLETS INTO THESE TREES, TAKE THEM BACK TO THE SHOP AND USE THEM FOR ACTUAL CHAINSAW TESTS. [ CLICK ] FIRING IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ GUNSHOT ] [ LAUGHS ] THAT LOOKS LIKE AN EXIT WOUND IF I'VE EVER SEEN ONE. [ GUNSHOTS ] WE NEED A BIGGER LOG. Narrator: AND THAT TURNS OUT TO BE THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE DAY... THINK SLOW THOUGHTS. Narrator: ...BECAUSE EVEN WITH TWO LOGS TAPED TOGETHER... [ GUNSHOTS ] IT'S IN ONE END AND STRAIGHT OUT THE OTHER. HOW MANY MythBusters DOES IT TAKE TO SHOOT A BULLET IN A TREE AND KEEP IT THERE? APPARENTLY MORE THAN TWO 'CAUSE THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS. [ CLICK, GUNSHOT ] Narrator: AND IT'S NOT GETTING ANY LESS RIDICULOUS... [ WHIRRING ] NOTHING. [ GUNSHOT ] Narrator: BECAUSE TRY AS THEY MIGHT... -I THINK IT TUMBLED AS IT WENT BETWEEN THE TWO LOGS. -YEAH. [ GUNSHOT ] Narrator: THE SHELLS ARE NOT STICKING, EVEN WITH SOLID PINE BOARDS STRAPPED IN FRONT TO HELP SLOW DOWN THE BULLET. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT BUILDING A CHAINSAW-SWINGING ARM RIG WAS GOING TO BE THE HARD PART. IT ENDS UP, IT'S GETTING A BULLET INTO A TREE. -ALL RIGHT. -LET'S LINE HER UP. THAT BACK THERE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOGS THAT WE HAVE, WITH BOARDS STRAPPED ON IT. THIS HAS TO WORK, RIGHT? Narrator: WELL, YOU'D HOPE SO. THE MYTHICAL TREE MAY HAVE BEEN MUCH BIGGER, THE BULLETS SLOWED BY A RICOCHET OR FIRED FROM A GREATER DISTANCE. SO THERE'S HOPE YET. BIGGEST STUMP WITH BOARDS IN FRONT OF IT IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ GUNSHOTS ] WHAT YOU THINK, MAN? I DON'T SEE AN EXIT WOUND, BUT YOU KNOW HOW THIS WHOLE THING GOES. THERE'S A HINT OF SOMETHING, WHICH, TO ME, IMPLIES THAT I THINK WE'RE JUST SOLIDLY IN THERE. SO I THINK WE LODGED IT. Narrator: AT LAST, AND WITH A GOOD CHUNK OF THE BUDGET BLOWN ON AMMO, THEY GOT WHAT THEY CAME FOR. SO I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE. WE'RE GOING TO PACK EVERYTHING UP, TAKE IT BACK TO THE SHOP, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BRING ON THE CHAINSAW. ¶¶ WHOO! ¶¶ HEY, JON. AM I BEAUTIFUL? LIKE A VICTORIAN WOMAN. Narrator: BACK AT CHAINSAW CENTRAL, THE GUYS HAVE CALLED IN SOME EXPERT ASSISTANCE. SO, GENTLEMEN, WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS, YOU'VE FIRED A BULLET INTO THE LOG, AND NOW YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE IN THE LOG IS THE BULLET. [ GUNSHOT ] Narrator: THAT'S IT IN A NUTSHELL. IN AND NO OUT. Narrator: RYAN AND JON FINALLY GOT A RIFLE BULLET TO STICK IN A STUMP. [ GUNSHOT ] [ GUNSHOT ] AND DR. BRADLEY PURDUE HAS A PORTABLE X-RAY MACHINE TO HELP FIND IT. YOU GOT YOUR TRAJECTORY, THE POINT OF ENTRY. WE'LL WORK OFF OF THAT, BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET TWO ANGLES ON IT TO DETERMINE BOTH OUR HORIZONTAL AND VERTICAL PLANES TO DETERMINE THE DEPTH. Narrator: SO THE DOC GOES TO WORK. WELL, HERE WE GO. READY? AND... [ BEEP ] OKAY. THAT SHOULD DO IT. Narrator: IT TURNS OUT, IT'S AS QUICK AND EASY AS FALLING OFF A YOU-KNOW-WHAT. WHAT WE'VE DETERMINED IS, YOUR BULLET IS SITTING SOMEWHERE RIGHT THERE IN THAT LOG AT THIS DEPTH. NOW WE JUST GOT TO DIG THROUGH THESE LOGS AND FIND 'EM. ALL RIGHT. YOU GUYS ARE THE BRAINS. Narrator: THEY'RE ALSO THE BRAWN. [ REVVING ] TO GET WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF THE BURIED BULLET, BRIAN FIRST CLEARS A SIZABLE CHUNK OF TIMBER. ALL RIGHT. IF THIS WORKED OUT, OUR BULLET IS SOMEWHERE RIGHT UNDER HERE. AT THIS POINT, IT COMES DOWN TO A LITTLE BIT OF GENTLE SURGERY. GONNA SLICE IN UNTIL WE GET TO THAT BULLET. OUR X-RAY WORK PUT THE BULLET SOMEWHERE IN THIS REGION. SO I HAD TO TAKE SPECIAL, TINY, LITTLE CHOPS UNTIL WE FOUND IT, BUT THERE SHE IS. WE'LL CUT THE REST OF THIS OFF, GET THAT PLASTIC ON THERE, GIVE US A NICE, CLEAR WINDOW OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND THEN TRY TO FIRE A BULLET OUT OF A PIECE OF WOOD! [ LAUGHS ] I'M EXCITED. Narrator: AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE AT THE CORE OF THIS TALL TALE -- THAT A CHAINSAW COULD DISLODGE AN EMBEDDED BULLET WITH ENOUGH VELOCITY TO LIQUIDATE A LUMBERJACK. WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO TEST A CHAINSAW AGAINST A REAL BULLET IN A REAL TREE. SO I'M GOING TO ADAPT THIS RIG, GET OUR CHAINSAW TO SWING PROPERLY, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO FINALLY PUT THIS MYTH TO THE TEST. Narrator: BRIAN'S REPURPOSED THAT ACRYLIC PLATE, SO WHATEVER HAPPENS WILL GET A WOODPECKER'S-EYE VIEW. OKAY. THAT'S GREAT. Narrator: BUT JUST POPPING THE BULLET OUT WON'T BE ENOUGH. IT HAS TO GO FAST. LET'S TALK ABOUT BULLET LETHALITY. THE BULLET FROM OUR GUN TRAVELS AROUND 2,500 FEET PER SECOND, WITH THE LOWEST BAR WE CAN SET BEING AN OLD MUSKET LOADER, AROUND 400 FEET PER SECOND. THAT'S THE BAR WE'RE GOING TO SET AT THE BOTTOM. IF WE DON'T ACHIEVE 400 FEET PER SECOND FROM THAT BULLET OFF THE CHAINSAW, IT'S NOT LETHAL. [ BUZZING ] OH, YEAH! [ MOTOR REVVING ] YEAH! ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO. YOU READY? -YEAH. -OKAY. CHAINSAW VERSUS BULLET IN LOG IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ REVVING AND BUZZING ] [ REVVING STOPS ] OOH! I GOT...YEAH, I GOT YOU. I GOT YOU. OH, I FEEL SOMETHING, THOUGH. -I THOUGHT I FELT SOMETHING. -I DEFINITELY FELT IT HIT. OH, OH, OH! -WHERE IS IT, MAN? -WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. I FELT...I THOUGHT I FELT SOMETHING, LIKE, CHOO! I CAN TELL YOU, IT DISAPPEARED FASTER THAN THE FOAM. I DIDN'T SEE WHERE IT WENT. -HEY! I FOUND THE BULLET, JON. -[ LAUGHS ] IT'S BETWEEN HERE AND THE HIGH SPEED. OH! HOW IS IT? OH, IT DEFINITELY GOT A PIECE OF IT. LOOK AT THAT. Narrator: THE BULLET'S IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE, BUT CAN THE SAME BE SAID FOR THE MYTH? OOH! [ LAUGHS ] -OH. -IT DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT OUT. IT CLIPPED THE BULLET, FLIPPED IT BACKWARDS AND THEN SHOT IT ALMOST OUT AND THEN STOPPED. [ BUZZING ] THAT WAS AN INTERESTING RESULT. WE WATCHED THE SAW BLADE COME DOWN, ENGAGE THE BULLET, SEND IT FLYING UNTIL...UHH! IT JAMMED, STUCK IN ONE SPOT. SO WE LOOKED AT THE HIGH-SPEED FOOTAGE, TRACED THE PATH OF THE BULLET, DID THE MATH, AND WE GOT 132 FEET PER SECOND, WAY BELOW OUR LETHALITY THRESHOLD. [ BUZZING ] SO CAN I SAY THE "B" WORD NOW? YOU KNOW WHAT? I'VE GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE SET UP, ACTUALLY. -OH? -YEAH. [ WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY ] OOH, THE AUDIENCE IS GONNA LIKE THAT. -YEAH, I THOUGHT SO. -YEAH. Narrator: BUT BEFORE CONCLUDING THE CHAINSAW CONUNDRUM... YOU READY, JON? Narrator: ...A REBORN BUSTER WILL REJOIN THE TEAM FOR A DEADLY DATE WITH A CHIMNEY CANNON. THREE, TWO, ONE. [ EXPLOSION ] OH! [ LAUGHS ] ¶¶ ¶¶ Narrator: TO FIND OUT IF A PROPANE-POWERED FIREPLACE CAN ACTUALLY SHOOT A MAN FROM A CHIMNEY, JON AND BRIAN NEED THE RIGHT KIND OF HOUSE IN THE RIGHT KIND OF NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS IS OUR TEST SITE. JUST IMAGINE WHEN WE'RE DONE SETTING UP, YOU KNOW, A WALL HERE, A WALL HERE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOME COMFORTS FROM HOME, LIKE, A COUCH, A CARPET, MAYBE SOME PAINTINGS. AND THEN FOR THOSE FREEZING COLD CALIFORNIA WINTERS, OUR FIREBOX WITH THE CHIMNEY ON TOP AND THE BURGLAR STUCK IN IT. [ MAKING BOOPING SOUNDS ] NOT A LOT OF HOUSES GET BUILT BY LAYING THE CARPET FIRST. Narrator: AND VERY FEW BOAST A FEATURE FIREPLACE THAT DOES DOUBLE DUTY AS AN EXPLOSIVE INTRUDER EXTRUDER. GET HER PERFECTLY LEVELED. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE 12 FEET OF CHIMNEY UP ON TOP. YEAH, I KNOW. Narrator: THEY RAISE THE WALLS WITHOUT RAISING A SWEAT. -IT'S NOT A BAD-LOOKING HOUSE. -YEAH. Narrator: BUT THE SAME CAN'T BE SAID FOR BRIAN'S EASY HOME ASSEMBLY CHIMNEY IN A CRATE CONCEPT. WHOA. THE FORKS WON'T CLEAR NOW... WON'T CLEAR? ...IF YOU GET IT ALL THE WAY IN. Narrator: WHAT WAS PERFECTLY SOUND IN THEORY IS PROVING A WHOLE LOT TRICKIER IN PRACTICE. AS WE GET HIGHER, HIGHER AND EVEN HIGHER, IT'S KIND OF GOING TO GET DANGEROUS. WE CAME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE IDEA. IF WE PUT THE REMAINDER OF THE CHIMNEY TOGETHER ON THE GROUND INTO ONE LARGE PIECE AND PUT IT UP, THAT'S ONE MOVE AND MORE TO WORK WITH. WHAT'S THIS "WE" BUSINESS, BRIAN? ALL RIGHT. OKAY. YOUR FINGERS OUT? FORWARD A LITTLE BIT. THERE YOU GO. -OOH, YEAH. PUSH. -GOOD. PUSH, PUSH, PUSH. YEAH. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE HARDEST PART ABOUT THIS MYTH IS JUST GETTING THIS CHIMNEY UP. Narrator: THE SEGMENTS ARE HEAVY AND FRAGILE, SO IT'S VERY MUCH A CASE OF STEADY AS SHE GOES. WE'RE STILL ON THE PALLET, BUT IT'S STARTING TO ANGLE ONTO THE FRONT. YEAH, THAT'S PERFECT. HOLD IT. SLOW, SLOW, SLOW. YOU HAVE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS TO THIS. YOU HAVE A ROUND CYLINDER IN SECTIONS GLUED TOGETHER IN A SQUARE FRAME. OH, THAT'S NICE. THAT'S REAL NICE. Narrator: AT THIS POINT, GETTING THIS ON TOP OF THAT FIREBOX IS TESTING OUR INGENUITY. THIS THING ONLY WANTS TO GO FORWARD IN, LIKE, 2-INCH INCREMENTS. WELL, YOU GOT 4 INCHES, SO YOU'RE GOOD. ALL RIGHT. Narrator: THEIR PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE PAY OFF. AHH! Narrator: AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT... HOLY CRAP. WE MADE A CHIMNEY. Narrator: JON'S SOON IN HARNESS TO STRIP BACK THE SCAFFOLD... [ WHIRRING ] ...WHILE BRIAN GETS DOWN TO THE NUTS AND BOLTS. AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS MYTH IS THAT LEAKY FIREPLACE. NOW, REMEMBER, THEIRS WAS A PROPANE RETROFIT. IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR US TO DO THE SAME. I'VE GOT TO PUT A COUPLE HOLES IN HERE FOR THE PROPANE AND THE IGNITER, AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THE SAME SETUP THEY DID. [ WHIRRING ] IGNITION. IGNITION. GAS. Narrator: IN A FINAL FLOURISH, THE CERAMIC SMOKESTACK GETS SPRIG-VENEERED. YOU KNOW, I HAD NO IDEA JON WAS A MASTER BRICK MASON. Narrator: AND THEIR LIVING ROOM LAUNCH PAD IS READY FOR ACTION. [ WHIRRING ] WE HAVE OUR CHIMNEY UP, AND WE'RE READY FOR OUR FIRST TEST. IT'S PURELY PROOF OF CONCEPT. WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IS, DO WE GET THE IGNITION WE NEED, AND DO WE GET THE COMBUSTION WE NEED? AND YOU MAY NOTICE A LITTLE EXTRA SUPPORT OVER HERE. THAT'S JUST IN CASE SOMETHING DOESN'T GO QUITE AS PLANNED. Narrator: AND THAT'S ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY. WHATEVER FATE AWAITS OUR JUMPING JACK FLASH... OH, I SEE HIM STRUGGLING. ACTUALLY, THAT'S ME STRUGGLING. Narrator: REST ASSURED, IT WILL BE A GAS, GAS, GAS. [ EXPLOSION ] ¶¶ [ BUZZING ] Narrator: WITH THE MYTH OF THE CHAINSAW BULLET IN SPLINTERS... WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE A GUN, AND WE MADE, WHAT, A CONVEYOR BELT? A NOT...WE MADE A...YEAH! Narrator: BRIAN AND JON HAVE OPTED TO SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADE THE HARDWARE. AT THIS POINT, WE'RE DONE WITH OUR SAW. BUT IT'S TIME TO TURN THAT DIAL UP TO 11. Narrator: DENNIS CAHOON IS A 30-YEAR LOGGING VETERAN WHO STILL HAS ALL HIS FINGERS AND A SUPER-CHARGED SHREDDER HE CALLS A HOT SAW. HEY, DENNIS. I SEE YOU BROUGHT THE BEAST. YEP. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE CHAINSAW THROWDOWN? -LOVE TO. -[ LAUGHS ] OKAY. LET'S DO IT. Narrator: TO SEE WHAT MAKES DENNIS' HOT SAW SO HOT, THEY'VE SET UP A CHALLENGE -- ONE LOG A PIECE WITH BRIAN ON THE TRUSTY, TINY 2-STROKE. COME ON, YOU LITTLE [bleep]. WELL, I SUDDENLY GET THE FEELING THAT WE'RE COMPETING IN THE WRONG WEIGHT CLASS. Narrator: THE RULES ARE SIMPLE. THE FIRST MAN TO SLICE THROUGH HIS STUMP IS THE WINNER. [ MOTOR REVVING ] YOU GUYS READY? [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] THREE, TWO, ONE! GO! [ BUZZING ] Jon: DENNIS WENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH, ALL THE WAY BACK UP AND THEN WENT HOME, MADE A CUP OF TEA, READ THE NEWSPAPER, TOOK A SHOWER, CAME ALL THE WAY BACK. AND I THINK BRIAN WAS ABOUT 3 INCHES INTO HIS LOG. [ BUZZING ] [ LAUGHS ] TAKE THAT, MAN! WELL, AT LEAST YOU CUT KNOT. -THAT'S HARDER WOOD. -[ LAUGHS ] I THINK THAT SHOWS US WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT IS, THOUGH. Narrator: AND THAT HUGE POWER DIFFERENCE COULD BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THE MYTH. SO, DENNIS, CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME SPECS ON YOUR SAW? YEAH, IT'S A 250cc MOTORCYCLE MOTOR MADE INTO A CHAINSAW. IT REVS ABOUT 10,000 R.P.M.s. CHAIN SPEED IS APPROACHING 200 MILES AN HOUR, PROBABLY EIGHT TIMES THE HORSEPOWER OF YOUR REGULAR CHAINSAW. [ LAUGHS ] Jon: THAT HOT SAW IS A BEAST. SO WE ARE SPENDING COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF TIME SCREWING THINGS DOWN AND GLUING AND NAILING AND STAPLING AND STRAPPING IT IN BECAUSE WE WANT TO PAY IT THE UTMOST RESPECT IN TERMS OF SAFETY, AND WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO GO WRONG. Narrator: IF THERE'S ANYTHING AT ALL TO THIS MYTH OF THE LUMBERJACK WHO FELLED HIMSELF, THE MIGHTY HOT SAW IS ITS VERY BEST CHANCE OF SUCCESS. -NOW WE'RE LOGGING. -READY? READY. [ MOTOR REVVING ] ¶¶ Narrator: THEY INCH THE SPEEDING CHAIN TOWARDS THE EMBEDDED BULLET. ¶¶ [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] [ BUZZING ] Narrator: AND IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, IT'S SHOT FROM THE STUMP. -HOLD! -HOLDING! -HOLD! -YOU'RE CLEAR! [ MOTOR REVVING ] OH. EVERYTHING HAPPENED EXTREMELY QUICKLY. [ BUZZING ] WE REVVED THE CHAINSAW UP. SMOKE BLEW IN MY FACE, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN... [ IMITATES REVVING SOUND ] DONE. [ REVVING ] HOW DID WE DO? IT HIT IT. THE BULLET DISAPPEARED. -IT'S SURE NOT IN HERE. -NO. Narrator: IT'S NOT LONG BEFORE BRIAN'S EAGLE EYE SPOTS THE MISSING MISSILE. AH, GUYS! FOUND IT! IT LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHER ONES. IT PEELED THE JACKET OFF OF IT. Narrator: THAT SOUNDS MORE THAN PROMISING. -THERE IT GOES. -OH! -IT'S IN TRAJECTORY. -GO STRAIGHT. -IT SHOT IT. -IT DID. -PING! -AND IT HIT RIGHT OFF THE SAW. -OH! -AND THEN IT WENT SIDEWAYS. GUYS, I THINK WE SHOT A BULLET WITH A CHAINSAW. YEAH. I THINK SO, TOO. [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: OR DID THEY? IT WAS SO, SO PROMISING. IT JUST DISAPPEARED IN REAL TIME, AND EVEN LOOKED GOOD ON THE HIGH-SPEED. IT WAS JUST GONE. BUT THEN BRIAN AND THE CAMERA CREW DID THE MATH, AND THE BULLET PEAKS AT 193 FEET PER SECOND. NOW THAT'S TWICE AS FAST AS A STANDARD CHAINSAW, BUT IT'S STILL WAY BELOW OUR LETHALITY BENCHMARK. [ BUZZING ] AT THIS POINT, WE'VE GIVEN THIS MYTH ITS BEST SHOT, AN EXTREME CHAINSAW, AN EXTREME RIG, EVERYTHING AS PRECISE AS POSSIBLE. BUT THIS THING -- IT MIGHT GIVE YOU A SHAVE, HURT YOUR EYE, BUT NOT MUCH ELSE. [ CLATTER ] SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT'S CONCLUSIVE. WE HAD A CHAINSAW SO POWERFUL, IT WAS BUILT AROUND A MOTORCYCLE ENGINE AND STILL ONLY GOT HALF THE SPEED OF AN OLD-TIMEY MUSKET BALL. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THIS MYTH IS TOTALLY, UH... B-B-BUSTED! BUSTED. AND TO THE RELIEF OF ALL THE LOGGERS WHO ARE STILL OUT THERE. THAT, TOO. Narrator: SO THAT'S ONE MYTH DEFUSED AND ANOTHER ABOUT TO BE DETONATED. COMING UP, WILL BUSTER SURVIVE HIS COMEBACK AS A CORK IN A CHIMNEY? [ EXPLOSION ] [ LAUGHTER ] ¶¶ ¶¶ -OH, YOU READY, JON? -YEAH. HOW ABOUT I PUT THE GAS HERE, A SAFE DISTANCE AWAY, AND THEN YOU PLUMB IT OVER? -SURE. THAT'S SAFE. LET'S DO THAT. Narrator: IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PROVE YOU CAN BLOW A BURGLAR FROM A CHIMNEY... ONE! [ CLICK ] ...JON AND BRIAN HAVE FOUND THE MAGIC MIX OF PROPANE TO AIR IS 5%. [ WHOOSHING ] ¶¶ SO HERE'S HOW THIS WHOLE THING IS GOING TO WORK. I'M GOING TO FLIP THIS SWITCH, IT'S GOING TO OPEN A VALVE OVER THERE, SENDING PROPANE TO THE FIREBOX. AND THIS GAS WILL BE IGNITED BY A TINY ELECTRIC CHARGE THAT I HAVE STUFFED UP IN THAT CHIMNEY. IN ORDER TO KNOW HOW MUCH PROPANE WE'RE USING, WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE IT THROUGH THIS FLOW METER. AND WHEN WE GET 5% PROPANE IN THAT CHIMNEY, I'M GOING TO HIT THIS SWITCH. AND BOOM. PROOF OF CONCEPT WITH UNSEALED CHIMNEY IN THREE, TWO, ONE. GO! [ WHOOSHING ] -THAT WAS GOOD. -WHOOSH! ¶¶ [ WHOOSHING ] OBVIOUSLY, WE GOT THE FUEL MIXTURE RIGHT BECAUSE IT CAME SHOOTING OUT THE TOP. I'M REALLY LIKING HOW IT'S LOOKING FOR THE FULL-SCALE. TIME FOR A BURGLAR TO BREAK IN. [ LAUGHS ] THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR FIRST TEST AND OUR FINAL TEST, HOPEFULLY, IS THE FINAL TEST WILL BE A CONTAINED EXPLOSION. NOW, WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE SAY "CONTAINED EXPLOSION"? WELL, IF YOU TAKE SOME BLACK POWDER AND YOU POUR IT IN AN OPEN SURFACE AND YOU LIGHT IT, IT GOES... [ IMITATES WHOOSH ] BUT YOU TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF BLACK POWDER AND YOU WRAP IT IN SOME TAPE NICE AND TIGHT, THAT WHOOSH TURNS INTO A BANG! [ EXPLOSION ] AND SO, HOPEFULLY, WHEN WE HAVE THAT CRIMINAL STUCK IN THE TOP OF OUR CHIMNEY, HE'LL FLY OUT OF THERE LIKE HIS BUTT'S ON FIRE. ¶¶ Narrator: THERE'S JUST TIME FOR A FEW HOMEY TOUCHES BEFORE THIS MYTH GETS PUT TO THE TORCH. BOOM! AW! BEAUTIFUL! HOW DOES IT LOOK? [ LAUGHS ] IT LOOKS LIKE A HAPPY FAMILY TO ME. -I THINK SO, MAN. I THINK SO. -[ LAUGHS ] Narrator: ADD ONE NOT-SO-HAPPY BURGLAR BUSTER... THIS IS THE MAN OF THIS MYTH. IT'S TIME FOR OUR BURGLAR TO GET STUCK IN OUR CHIMNEY. Narrator: ...WHO'S ALREADY HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT HIS FIRST DAY BACK ON THE JOB. GOT TO REMEMBER, JON. THIS GUY TRIED REALLY HARD TO GET IN. WE GOT VALUABLE PAINTINGS OF DOGS. -HIS ASS IS IN. -OKAY. Narrator: BUT THERE'S ONE SMALL SNAG. OH, I SEE HIM STRUGGLING. ACTUALLY, THAT'S ME STRUGGLING. Narrator: DESPITE APPEARANCES, BUSTER'S NOT QUITE A SNUG ENOUGH FIT. SO WE WANT OUR BURGLAR TO HAVE A GOOD FIT IN THE CHIMNEY TO GET THE BEST CHANCE OF AN EXPLOSION. HE'S A LITTLE FIT RIGHT NOW, SO WE NEED TO MAKE HIM A LITTLE MORE ROTUND. TO DO THAT, WE PUT A LITTLE EXPANDING FOAM AROUND HIS BELLY IN A PLASTIC BAG. Narrator: WITH OUR BEEFED UP BURGLAR NOW FIRMLY WEDGED IN, THEY'RE SET TO BUST OR CONFIRM THIS MYTH ONCE AND FOR ALL. AT THIS POINT, OUR BURGLAR'S STUCK IN THE TOP OF OUR CHIMNEY. THAT MAKES AN ENCLOSED VESSEL. AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO POP HIM OUT LIKE A CHAMPAGNE CORK. ¶¶ FIREPLACE LEAK WITH BURGLAR STUCK IN THE CHIMNEY IN THREE, TWO, ONE! [ BOOM ] [ LAUGHS ] [ LAUGHS ] [ BOOM ] WELL, THERE YOU GO. [ LAUGHS ] OH! [ BOOM ] LOOK, THERE'S SMOKE COMING OUT OF HIS PANTS. [ LAUGHS ] STRAIGHT OUT OF THE CARTOONS. -OH! JON! -YEAH? OUR LIVING ROOM! BO'S PICTURE! OH, REALLY? ¶¶ [ LAUGHS ] [ HISSES ] OUR CRIMINAL KIND OF JUST POPPED UP AND LANDED RIGHT BACK IN THE CHIMNEY. BUT THE STOICHIOMETRY WAS RIGHT. THE DOORS BOWED OPEN. [ BOOM ] BO BLEW OFF THE WALL. OUR ROBBER SHOT UP ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF BUT THEN LANDED RIGHT BACK IN OUR CHIMNEY, SO IT WASN'T A GREAT ESCAPE. Narrator: WITH ALL THE ELEMENTS PERFECTLY IN PLACE, BUSTER STILL COULDN'T RISE TO THE OCCASION. BUT THEY'RE NOT GOING HOME WITHOUT SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR THEIR EFFORTS. IN FINEST "MythBusters" TRADITION, THAT MEANS RAMPING IT WAY UP TO GET A RESULT. WE'RE ABOUT TO ADD MORE OXYGEN INTO OUR CHIMNEY, AND THAT MEANS A BIGGER BOOM. Narrator: INSTEAD OF USING AIR, WHICH IS MOSTLY NITROGEN, THEY'RE PUMPING IN PURE OXYGEN. BUT WILL THAT BE ENOUGH TO FINALLY BLAST BUSTER INTO THE BACKYARD? -YOU READY? -I'M READY. OKAY. WHAT WOULD IT TAKE? IN THREE, TWO, ONE. [ EXPLOSION ] OH! [ LAUGHS ] I FELT THAT ONE IN THE CHEST. [ EXPLOSION ] Narrator: THAT PROBABLY GOES FOR EVERYONE IN A 1-MILE RADIUS. [ EXPLOSIONS ] ¶¶ YOU THINK WE'LL STILL GET THE DEPOSIT BACK ON THE HOUSE? -NO. -OOH. [ EXPLOSION ] Jon: AS YOU CAN SEE, ALL THAT EXTRA OXYGEN DEFINITELY GAVE US MORE BANG FOR OUR BUCK. HOLY MOLY. LOOK AT THIS. [ GRUNTS ] OH. THIS IS A REINFORCED STEEL FIREBOX, AND IT TOTALLY JUST BOWED OUT OUR LITTLE SUPPORT STRUTS. [ EXPLOSION ] LOOK AT THE BURGLAR. [ LAUGHS ] IT BLEW HIS PANTS OFF. [ LAUGHS ] OH, WOW. I DON'T KNOW, THOUGH. I THINK HE MOSTLY FELL. -I DON'T THINK HE SHOT. -YEAH. HE'S NOT FAR FROM WHERE HE BEGAN. THAT MEANS THAT HIS BODY AND THE FIREPLACE WERE A GOOD ENOUGH SEAL THAT WHEN IT WENT OFF, IT JUST, BOOM, BLEW IT APART. [ EXPLOSION ] Narrator: AND THERE YOU HAVE IT. THE MYTHICAL PROPANE MIX BARELY BUDGED BUSTER, AND THE RAMPED-UP OXYGEN-RICH MIX BROUGHT THE HOUSE DOWN. BUT THERE WAS A DEFINITE FAILURE TO LAUNCH. -DEFINITELY BUSTED. -YEAH. HE DEFINITELY POPPED UP A LITTLE BIT ON THAT CHIMNEY, BUT HE DIDN'T SHOOT OUT. YEAH, BUT HE DEFINITELY SHOT OUT WHEN WE TURNED IT OVER THE TOP. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, HE DID. ALL RIGHT. -LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. -YEAH. I TOLD YOU, CRIME DOESN'T PAY. ¶¶
