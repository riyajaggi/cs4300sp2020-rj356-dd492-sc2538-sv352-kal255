 IS THIS THE TYPE OF WHEEL WE'RE UP AGAINST? YES, THIS SENSOR MONITORS THE WHEEL. IT CALCULATES THE SPEED OF THE BALL AND THE SPEED OF THE WHEEL. IT FEEDS THAT DATA INTO THE COMPUTER AND PROJECTS THE WINNING NUMBER. IN TIME TO GET A BET DOWN. SHALL WE TRY IT, WILLY? IT WEIGHS OVER 90 POUNDS. I HAVE TO MOVE NATURALLY. NO PROBLEM. PUT THE COAT ON, LET'S SEE HOW IT LOOKS. WELL, HE LOOKS LIKE HE HAS A FEW EXTRA MUSCLES, IF THAT'S POSSIBLE. TO KEEP DOWN THE SIZE AND THE WEIGHT, I HAD TO USE A MINIMUM POWER SOURCE, SO WILLY WILL HAVE TO STAY CLOSE TO THE TABLE. THIS WATCH FACE HAS A WINDOW WHICH NORMALLY GIVES THE DATE, BUT IN THIS CASE, IT WILL GIVE THE WINNING NUMBER. SEVENTEEN WINS. QUITE A COINCIDENCE. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL, BARNEY! WITH THAT AND CERTAIN OTHER DEVICES, I THINK WE CAN TAKE KOSTAS FOR THE MILLION AND A HALF. BUT THE MOMENT HE REALIZES HE'S BEEN HAD, HE'S GOING TO SEAL THE COUNTRY UP. HE WON'T LET ANYBODY OUT UNTIL HE GETS HIS MONEY BACK. YOU GOT TO WIN IT BEFORE YOU GET IT OUT. IT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MONEY BAG I'VE EVER SEEN. Man: MAKE YOUR BETS, PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. Croupier: 36 RED. MAKE YOUR BETS, PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. ONE. ARE LADIES PERMITTED TO PLAY THIS GAME? LADIES ARE PERMITTED TO PLAY ANY GAME THEY WISH IN THIS CASINO. UH, GENTLEMEN, MAY WE RESUME LATER THIS EVENING? I ADMIRE YOUR CHOICE OF GAMES, MADAM. IT'S BACCARAT, ISN'T IT? MM-HMM. I'VE NEVER PLAYED IT. I JUST THOUGHT THE MOST INTERESTING PEOPLE WERE AT THIS TABLE. IF IT WERE NOT TRUE BEFORE, IT CERTAINLY IS NOW. I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IN THIS COUNTRY, BACCARAT IS CALLED THE GAME OF THE PRINCE. PERHAPS I'D BETTER LEARN TO PLAY. I'D BE DELIGHTED TO INSTRUCT YOU. YOU'LL FIND ME A VERY WILLING PUPIL. IT IS REALLY A VERY SIMPLE GAME. ONE OF US BUYS THE BANK AND PLACES A BET. ONE OR MORE OF THE OTHER PLAYERS EQUALS THAT AMOUNT. NOW, SINCE I AM THE BANKER, I WILL DEAL. FIRST, THE BET. AND YOURS, AND MINE. AND YOURS, AND MINE. IF EITHER HAS AN EIGHT OR A NINE, THAT IS THE END OF THE GAME. IF NOT, THEN ONE CARD MAY BE DRAWN. WHICHEVER ONE HAS CLOSEST TO NINE WINS THE GAME. UNDERSTAND? [ CHUCKLING ] PLEASE. WELL, I HAVE A 10 AND A KING. THAT'S ZERO. A 10 OR A PICTURE IS ZERO, SO YOU HAVE TO DRAW. HERE. I HAVE A NINE AND A FOUR. THAT MAKES 13, OR THREE, BECAUSE ONLY THE LAST DIGIT COUNTS. NOW... UH-HUH. SEVEN... OH, YOU WIN. [ LAUGHING ] I THINK YOU'RE A DANGEROUS WOMAN. ALL WOMEN ARE DANGEROUS, YOUR HIGHNESS. I THINK I'M BEGINNING TO LIKE YOU MORE AND MORE. [ LAUGHING ] [ CLEARS THROAT ] WHAT IS IT? I'M OLIVER BORGMAN, HIGHNESS. OH, MR. BORGMAN. WELL, Y-Y-YOU ARE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. MY CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU, HIGHNESS. I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE ME, MY DEAR, IF WE CONTINUE THIS LESSON ANOTHER TIME. WELL, I HOPE IT'S AT THE VERY LEAST A TERRIBLY IMPORTANT AFFAIR OF STATE. TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, IT IS. PERHAPS A LITTLE LATER WE CAN HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER? WELL, IF YOU REALLY MUST GO. UNTIL LATER THEN, HUH? COME, BORGMAN. I MUST BE LOSING MY TOUCH. HE LEFT ME FOR BORGMAN. THEY LEFT THE CASINO TOGETHER. WHAT IF KOSTAS TURNS THE MONEY OVER NOW? HE WON'T. NOT UNTIL THE SHIP'S TIED UP AND THE GUNS ARE UNLOADED. I'M ON MY WAY. HOW LONG BEFORE YOU CAN START THE UNLOADING? OH, VERY SHORTLY, YOUR HIGHNESS. THERE IS ONE MATTER. I HATE TO BRING UP SO INDELICATE A SUBJECT AS MONEY, BUT THIS SORT OF TRANSACTION MUST OF COURSE BE C.O.D. THAT WAS OUR AGREEMENT. IN AMERICAN DOLLARS, HMM? $1,500,000 AMERICAN. NOT YET! WHEN THE GUNS ARE ON THE PIER, THEN YOU WILL BE PAID. OF COURSE, OF COURSE. GOODBYE. KARL! HE'S UNARMED. WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT? WHO I AM DOESN'T MATTER. I'M HERE TO DO A LITTLE BUSINESS. MAY I? WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS? EVERY PAPER HANDLER FROM NEW YORK TO HONG KONG HAS JUST BEEN WAITING FOR KOSTAS TO SELL THAT...DOUGH TO A WHOLESALER. I'M INTERESTED IN $200,000, MAYBE $300,000 WORTH OF THIS STUFF, IF THE DISCOUNT IS RIGHT. DISCOUNT? ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME KOSTAS' MONEY IS COUNTERFEIT? OH, COME ON NOW. LET'S NOT PLAY GAMES, ALL RIGHT? GET OUT. I'M HERE TO MAKE A BUY. GET OUT! Borgman: COUNTERFEIT MONEY?! GET WORD TO THE SHIP TO STAY WHERE THEY ARE. Karl: THAT MEANS WE'LL MISS THE TIDE. WE WON'T BE ABLE TO UNLOAD THE GUNS UNTIL MORNING. IF THAT MONEY'S COUNTERFEIT, WE MAY NEVER GET TO UNLOAD THEM. WELL, GET GOING! [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] THAT'S BARNEY. HEY, CHAMP. WELL, DID HE BUY IT? YEP. ANY CHANCE HE'LL TELL KOSTAS WHAT TO DO WITH HIS MONEY AND WALK AWAY FROM THE WHOLE DEAL? NO. HE'LL FIND A WAY TO GET ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT MONEY BEFORE HE DOES THAT. WE'VE ONLY BOUGHT OURSELVES SOME TIME. WHERE'S THE BAR? THANK YOU. TO BEAUTY, MY DEAR. IT IS THE ONE TEMPTATION I CAN NEVER RESIST. SO I'VE HEARD, YOUR HIGHNESS. YOUR EXPLOITS WITH WOMEN ARE LEGEND. OH, IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER MET A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THAT I DID NOT... WANT TO KNOW BETTER. YOUR HUSBAND MUST LOVE YOU VERY MUCH TO GIVE YOU SUCH A MAGNIFICENT STONE. MY HUSBAND? POOR CARLOS CAN'T EVEN AFFORD TO BUY HIS OWN DRINKS. I'M SURE THAT'S WHY HE MARRIED ME. WHY DID YOU MARRY HIM? I HAD TO BE MARRIED TO GET MY INHERITANCE. BUT I KNEW I COULD MARRY CARLOS AND STILL... DO EXACTLY AS I PLEASE. SCOTCH AND SODA, PLEASE. WELL, SPEAK OF THE DEVIL. GOOD EVENING. MAY I JOIN YOU? OH, NOT NOW, DARLING, WE'RE TELLING SECRETS. WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO THE BAR? WELL, I DON'T KNOW ANYONE AT THE BAR. THEN GO UPSTAIRS AND TAKE A NAP. MOMMY WILL BE UP TO TUCK YOU IN LATER. Croupier: THE BANK WINS. MAKE YOUR BETS, PLEASE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. TWO, BLACK.
