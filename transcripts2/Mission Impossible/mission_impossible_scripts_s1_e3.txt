 Mission: Impossible (1966â€“1973): Season 1, Episode 3 - Operation Rogosh - full transcript 
 Rogosh is an operative for a country hostile to the United States. When he strikes, he typically leaves dozens, if not hundreds, of bodies in his wake. Rogosh has been spotted in Los Angeles. But he will not crack under normal interrogation methods. Briggs comes up with an unusual plan. The IMF stages an accident where pedestrian Rogosh is struck by a car. When he awakes, he appears to be in a prison in his home country -- three years later.

[ WOMAN CRIES ] [ BUZZING ] Man: [ With accent ] THE PREMIER EMIL HAKVANI TODAY LASHED OUT AT THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE SAID THAT WHITCOMB IS MERELY CONTINUING THE POLICIES OF HIS PREDECESSORS. HAKVANI IS PRIME MINISTER? THE GOVERNMENT REVEALED TODAY THE RECENT ARREST OF COLONEL KLIMI, HEAD OF SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE. ALSO ARRESTED WERE KLIMI'S DEPUTY AND SEVERAL OTHER PERSONS IN THE BUREAU. IN SPORTS TODAY, THE 10,000-METER RECORD SET BY ORONAYEV IN THE 1968 OLYMPICS WAS BROKEN BY A 19-YEAR-OLD SWEDE. [ PAPERS SHUFFLE ] YOU ARE THE PROSECUTOR? WHY AM I A PRISONER HERE? AH, ROGASH, STOP IT. COLONEL KLIMI'S IMPLICATED YOU UP TO YOUR NECK. KLIMI? YES. YES. HE'S CONFESSED. WE DON'T REALLY NEED IT. BUT MY ORDERS ARE TO GET A CONFESSION OUT OF YOU, TOO, BEFORE THE TRIAL. NOW, YOU KNOW THIS BUSINESS AS WELL AS I DO. SAVE US BOTH TIME. SAVE YOURSELF FROM ANY MORE... MASSAGES. ONCE MORE... HOW MUCH HAVE THE AMERICANS BEEN PAYING YOU, HUH? LAST SUMMER IN BERLIN, WHAT DID YOU DO WITH THOSE DOCUMENTS? HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN HERE? HOW LONG HAS EMIL HAKVANI BEEN PRIME MINISTER? WHAT IS THIS? A BUILD-UP TO A DEFENSE OF INSANITY? WELL, ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE INSANE. WAIT -- WAIT A MINUTE. LISTEN TO ME. YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH? I DON'T KNOW HOW I GOT HERE OR WHY I'M HERE. WHEN I KNEW KLIMI, HE WAS A MAJOR, OUR INTELLIGENCE ATTACHE IN LOS ANGELES. BACK IN '66. YOU HAVE BEEN HIS DEPUTY FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS! NO! ROGASH, FOR AN INTELLIGENT MAN -- LISTEN! THE LAST THING I REMEMBER, I WAS CROSSING A STREET IN LOS ANGELES. YOU HEARD OF LOS ANGELES? IN AMERICA! YOU HAVEN'T BEEN THERE IN THREE YEARS. WHAT YEAR IS THIS? '69. YOU RETURNED FROM AMERICA IN LATE '66. SOMETHING TO DO WITH AN ACCIDENT. YES, THAT'S RIGHT. I WAS HIT BY A CAR. HIT BY A CAR AND THEN, I WOKE UP THIS MORNING. THREE YEARS. I WAS IN LOS ANGELES. SEND IN DR. ZOLTAN. MYSELF AND ANOTHER AGENT NAMED LAZLOFF. WE WERE BEING FOLLOWED. THE CAR. LAZLOFF. FIND LAZLOFF! LAZLOFF. SIR. HOW ARE YOU, ROGASH? YOU KNOW ME? WHY, ROGASH, WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE THE NIGHT YOU WERE ARRESTED AT THE STATE RECEPTION. DOCTOR, UH... DOCTOR, A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION. A MAN IS HURT BY A CAR. THREE YEARS LATER, HE REMEMBERS NOTHING SINCE THE ACCIDENT. CAN THIS EVEN HAPPEN? YES. IT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO HAPPEN. DELAYED AMNESIA. NOT OFTEN. WHY? OH...NO REASON. IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. NO. INSANITY... AMNESIA... THESE ARE NO DEFENSE IN CAPITAL CRIMES AGAINST THE STATE. TAKE HIM OUT. YOU'RE NOT BAD. NOT BAD? WAIT TILL YOU SEE ME PLAY MY FALSTAFF. OKAY, HE'S BOUGHT IT. NOW KEEP ONE THING FIRMLY IN MIND. HE'S BRILLIANT -- AND AN EXPERT. NOBODY PUSH, NO QUESTIONS. LET HIM CONTINUE DOING ALL THE WORK, LET HIM DIG FOR INFORMATION. HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE? I CAN'T TELL YOU, BUT DON'T RUSH IT. ONE LITTLE LUMP, AND TIME RUNS OUT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. IF MY LIFE WERE AT STAKE, I WOULD HATE TO HAVE YOU DEFEND ME. THANK YOU. MY AIM IS TO INSPIRE A COMPLETE...LACK OF CONFIDENCE. MAJOR! COLONEL KLIMI! [ KEYS JINGLE ] MR. LOPEK'S HERE. HOW ARE WE TODAY, MR. ROGASH? YOU DON'T LOOK TOO GOOD. WELL...GET ON WITH IT. THERE'S NO RECORD OF ANY OF THOSE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT YOU TOLD ME OF. AND I CAN'T GET TO THOSE PEOPLE YOU ASKED ABOUT. THESNY AND BOGUSS HAVE DISAPPEARED. AND ARKAPIN HAS BEEN ARRESTED. SO HAS YOUR SECRETARY. AND I CAN'T GET IN THERE TO TALK TO THEM. AND LAZLOFF? LAZLOFF? WELL, DON'T YOU REMEMBER? HE WAS SHOT LAST WEEK. I DID MY BEST AT THE TRIAL. YOU REPRESENTED HIM? YES. AND YOU'RE TO BE MY ADVOCATE? OF COURSE. WHAT AM I ACCUSED OF? WHAT? JUST TELL ME AGAIN. WELL, YOU'VE BEEN DENOUNCED AS AN AMERICAN AGENT ALONG WITH KLIMI AND LAZLOFF AND THE OTHERS. [ Whispering ] The others. I THINK THAT PERHAPS... SIT DOWN, MR. LOPEK! WHO IS THAT? HMM? WELL, THAT'S YOUR SECRETARY. LISTEN, I DO THINK THAT ANOTHER TIME -- BE STILL, MR. LOPEK, AND LISTEN TO ME. I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND FOUND I HAVE NO MEMORY OF THE PAST THREE YEARS. IS HE THERE? YES. IT'S VERY STRANGE, MAJOR KLIMI. THE HOUSE HAS BEEN CHANGED TO LOOK LIKE THE PRISON WING OF STEFAN CASTLE. I SAW MANY GUARDS IN UNIFORM, AND I S... WELL, GO ON, LAZLOFF. WELL, SIR, I EVEN THOUGHT I SAW YOU. Rogash: I'VE BEEN TRYING, BUT I CAN'T REMEMBER. Lopek: I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. SINCE 1966? IT WAS OCTOBER 31. YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING YOU DID AFTER THAT? I DON'T REMEMBER. I BOUGHT TICKETS TO LEAVE LOS ANGELES ON NOVEMBER 2 BECAUSE ON NOVEMBER 4... NO, I MEAN MORE RECENTLY LIKE THE PAST YEAR OR TWO. NOTHING. THEN, UH, YOU DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE INNOCENT OR GUILTY OF THE CHARGE? WELL, OF COURSE, I'M INNOCENT. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW FOR CERTAIN. I'M AFRAID, MR. ROGASH, THAT I CAN'T REPRESENT YOU. I, UH, SHOULDN'T HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO DEFEND YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU TOAD! [ Whispering ] What can I do? The new regime is out to get Klimi. You're caught in the middle. You know these power struggles. They might even try to arrest me. YOU LITTLE WORM! I'M NOT SOME CLERK. YOU'RE DEALING WITH EMERY ROGASH. GUARD! WE HEARD. IT MUST HAVE TAKEN SOME SELF-CONTROL. YOU'LL NEVER KNOW. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE ON THE SECOND. THAT'S TODAY. YES. AND WHATEVER IT IS IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN ON THE FOURTH. WE HAVE TWO DAYS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY'RE DOING, BUT I'M SURE IT'S DANGEROUS. I WANT YOU TO GET INTO THAT PLACE. AND GET ROGASH OUT. NO. KILL HIM. [ KEYS JINGLE ] YOU GET TO EXERCISE NOW. [ INDISTINCT VOICE ] OUT! WAIT, CAN I TALK TO HER? NO! WAIT. WAIT. EMERY. UH...DEAR... OH! [ CRYING ] OW! [ CRYING ] YOU WERE BEATEN? I DON'T KNOW WHY. I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING, ANYTHING. THINGS THAT HAPPENED. THINGS THAT DIDN'T. ANYTHING I THOUGHT THEY WANTED TO HEAR. WHAT DID THEY WANT TO HEAR? NOTHING. NOTHING SEEMS TO BE ANY USE. OH, EMERY, I'M SCARED. THEY DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE. THEY WANTED ME TO SAY YOU ARE WORKING FOR THE AMERICANS. AND DID YOU? NO. NO, THAT'S THE ONE THING I DIDN'T. I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY HELP. THEY KNOW WE DIDN'T MEET UNTIL AFTER WE CAME BACK FROM AMERICA. OH, EMERY, THE THINGS I TOLD THEM. AND WHAT WERE THEY? ALL THE...PRIVATE THINGS. [ Crying ] I'M SO ASHAMED. OH, THERE, THERE, THAT'S ALL RIGHT...DARLING. LISTEN, WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE DID YOU TELL THEM? EVERYTHING. ALL THE OPERATIONS WE DID LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT. THEY DIDN'T CARE. I TRIED, BUT THEY WOULDN'T LISTEN. ALL THEY WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT WAS AMERICA, NOTHING ELSE, BEFORE OR AFTER. THEY SAID THE WHOLE AMERICAN OPERATION WAS JUST A COVER, AND EVERYTHING I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT WAS JUST HEARSAY. HEARSAY? BECAUSE I WASN'T THERE. OH.

ABOUT THE BACTERIA CULTURES? [ CRYING ] DARLING, HOW -- HOW MANY DIED? I HAVE TO KNOW IF I WAS SUCCESSFUL. HOW MANY DIED? DO YOU REMEMBER? YOU KNOW WE AGREED NEVER TO MENTION IT. NEVER TO MENTION... HOW MANY DIED? WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? GET OUT OF HERE. [ SIGHS ] WE KNOW THE M.O. IS BACTERIOLOGICAL. NO, THAT'S ALL. SOON AS WE KNOW, YOU'LL KNOW. RIGHT.

NO, NOT TILL JANUARY AFTER. THEN YOU MISSED THE EPIDEMIC? OH, YES, THANK GOD. NOT THE RIOTS. HAH! THEY HAD MARTIAL LAW. THE PANIC LASTED THAT LONG? OH, YEAH. THERE WERE DEMONSTRATIONS AND LOOTIN'. THAT WAS A TIME. WHAT WAS THE DEATH TOLL? DO YOU REMEMBER? NOT EXACTLY. THOUSANDS, THOUGH. THOUSANDS. WE SHOT LAZLOFF, RIGHT? SO WHY NOT SHOOT ME? NO, THIS WAY'S MORE VISUAL. BESIDES, ROLLIN, YOU WERE BORN TO HANG. GUARDS! GUARDS! OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING, MR. LOPEK. I APOLOGIZE, BELIEVE ME, I APOLOGIZE FOR WHAT HAPPENED. I NEED YOUR HELP. I PAY YOU ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU WANT. I HAVE WITNESSES, TWO WITNESSES, TO WHAT HAPPENED IN AMERICA. PLEASE. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. Woman: PEOPLE'S PROSECUTOR WILL PROCEED. I INTEND TO SHOW THAT THE ACCUSED, EMERY ROGASH, WAS AN ACCOMPLICE OF THE TRAITOR KLIMI, ALREADY FOUND GUILTY BY THIS COURT AND DULY EXECUTED. I WILL ALSO SHOW THAT ROGASH, THREE YEARS AGO, WHEN IN AMERICA, BECAME A DOUBLE AGENT. NO. IF THE COURT PLEASE... MY CLIENT CATEGORICALLY DENIES ALL THE CHARGES. HE WISHES TO OFFER PROOF THAT HE IS A LOYAL AND DEVOTED SERVANT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC. I ASK THE DEFENSE ADVOCATE, ARE YOU REFERRING TO CERTAIN SUPPOSED SECRET OPERATIONS THAT THE ACCUSED PERFORMED ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT? YES. THIS COURT HAS ALREADY ATTEMPTED TO FIND THE FILES RELATING TO SUCH OPERATIONS. THEY WERE BURNED -- BY THE TRAITORS, KLIMI AND LAZLOFF. WILL THE COURT PLEASE QUESTION MAGDA BUJESKI? CALL MAGDA BUJESKI. STATE YOUR RELATIONSHIP TO THE ACCUSED, EMERY ROGASH. [ In robotic voice ] I WORKED IN HIS DEPARTMENT. I WAS HIS SECRETARY. WAS THE RELATIONSHIP ALSO NOT MORE, UM, INTIMATE? YES. DID THE ACCUSED EVER TALK TO YOU ABOUT HIMSELF AND COLONEL KLIMI? HE SAID THAT IN AMERICA, THEY BOTH BECAME MEMBERS OF AN UNDERGROUND GROUP PLEDGED TO DESTROY OUR PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HER?! IT'S A LIE! [ WHISPERING ] MY CLIENT ASKS THAT THE WITNESS BE ASKED ABOUT THE LATER OPERATIONS SHE AND HE CARRIED OUT AFTER HIS RETURN FROM AMERICA. WE ARE WASTING TIME. ALL RIGHT, ANSWER THE QUESTION. I... I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. WHEN AND WHERE WERE THESE SUPPOSED LATER OPERATIONS CARRIED OUT, MR. ROGASH? REMOVE THE WITNESS. WOULD THE COURT PLEASE CALL JOHN MAC-- MAY I RESPECTFULLY ADDRESS THE COURT? [ COUGHS ] FOR A... [ Softly ] Window, rifle. ...MOMENT? WHEN I WAS ASSIGNED TO THIS CASE, I TOOK IT WITH GREAT MISGIVINGS ABOUT DEFENDING AN ENEMY, AN ACCUSED ENEMY OF THE STATE. SIT DOWN, MR. LOPEK. EXCUSE ME, I, UH, WISH TO MAKE IT CLEAR, ONLY FOR THE RECORD, I AM REPRESENTING THIS MAN AS AN ACCOMMODATION TO THIS COURT, WHICH ASSIGNED ME, AND NOT OUT OF ANY PERSONAL CONVICTIONS OR SYMPATHIES. YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME! GUARD! MR. ROGASH, BE SEATED! WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO SAY, MR. LOPEK? MY LOYALTY IS COMPLETELY TO THIS PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC. FIRMLY... IF THE DEFENSE ADVOCATE IS FINISHED... I TAKE ONLY A MOMENT MORE OF YOUR TIME. ONLY TO APOLOGIZE TO THIS COURT FOR TAKING UP ITS VALUABLE TIME. WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL JOHN MACAVAHO? Rollin: DID YOU TALK RECENTLY TO THE ACCUSED? FROM MY CELL, YES. AND WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE QUESTIONS HE ASKED YOU? ALL ABOUT LOS ANGELES. MANY, MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT IT. DID YOU GET THE IMPRESSION THAT IF RELEASED, HE WOULD GO THERE? YES. THEN IN YOUR OPINION, HE WOULD DEFECT TO AMERICA IF HE COULD, HUH? OH, YES, I THINK SO. WHAT?! NO, I NEVER IMPLIED THAT! NO, I WAS ASKING ABOUT THE RESULTS OF AN ASSIGNMENT. NO, PLEASE, LISTEN. I'M A LOYAL AND EFFECTIVE AGENT. Woman: THE ACCUSED WILL BE SEATED. NO, NO, PLEASE, I BEG THE COURT TO BE ALLOWED TO EXPLAIN. I HAD AN ASSIGNMENT IN LOS ANGELES. IT WAS THE CONTAMINATION OF AN ENTIRE CITY'S WATER SUPPLY. IT WAS TOTALLY SUCCESSFUL. YOUR HONOR... IT'S WATERBORNE. [ GAVEL POUNDING ] THE ACCUSED WILL BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE BUT IS WARNED -- THAT HIS STORY WILL BE CHECKED IN EVERY DETAIL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. PLEASE, I WANT IT TO BE CHECKED. THE BURDEN OF PROOF RESTS WITH THE DEFENDANT, NOT WITH THIS COURT. WE WILL NEED MORE PARTICULARS. OF COURSE. I USED A BOTULIN CULTURE, A PECULIARLY DEADLY STRAIN OF BACTERIA AND AN EXTREMELY INTENSE SOLUTION WAS PREPARED AND CONTAINED IN FOUR HOLLOW, SMALL, PLASTIC FLASKS. ONLY FOUR CONTAINERS? YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THE VIRULENCE OF THE CULTURE AND THE STRATEGIC LOCATION IN WHICH THE FLASKS WERE PLACED. EACH CONTAINER WAS DESIGNED TO BE BROKEN APART BY A TIME MECHANISM. AND I PLACED ONE RIGHT AT THE MAJOR SLUICE GATE OF THE CHATSWORTH RESERVOIR. CHATSWORTH RESERVOIR SLUICE GATE. THIS RESERVOIR FEEDS THE ENTIRE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. YOUR HONOR... OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN THIS AREA. THE NEWSPAPERS ON NOVEMBER 4, 1966, AND THE WEEKS, EVEN MONTHS, FOLLOWING WILL GIVE YOU RESULTS FAR BETTER THAN I CAN. THOUSANDS OF DEATHS, COMPLETE PANIC, RIOTING, TOTAL CIVIL DISORDER. I PLACED ANOTHER ONE, ANOTHER CONTAINER, IN THE STONE CANYON RESERVOIR PUMPING STATION. IT SERVES AN AREA OF THREE MILLION PEOPLE. I PLACED A THIRD CONTAINER IN THE EAST LOS ANGELES MAIN DUCT BELOW THE FILTER. THIS I WILL DRAW THE COURT A MAP. YOUR HONOR, THIS IS HIGHLY IRRELEVANT. VERY CLEVER. BEAUTIFULLY DONE. I COMMEND ALL OF YOU. YOU FOOLED EVEN ROGASH...ALMOST. THIS PRISON... THIS TRIAL... MY AMNESIA... A FAKE... ALL A FAKE. I'M STILL IN AMERICA. SO CLOSE, BUT THERE IS STILL THE FOURTH CONTAINER WITH ENOUGH DEATH TO STRIKE DOWN TENS OF THOUSANDS OF YOU. YES. [ LAUGHING ] YES. YOU, THE MOST INEFFECTIVE. YOU WOULD BE THE LEADER. Briggs: Rogash. Rogash. YES? The fourth one, Rogash -- where do we find the fourth? Your cell has been hermetically sealed. The time devices on the three containers have been reset. We can open them by our signal. Whether or not you leave the room alive depends on your telling us the location of the fourth container. You have 15 seconds. [ TICKING ] GOVI RESERVOIR. THE CONTAINER IS ANCHORED AT THE MAIN SLUICE GATE. [ TICKING CONTINUES ] DID YOU HEAR ME?! GOVI RESERVOIR. MAIN SLUICE GATE! YES, WE HEARD. THEY TRICKED ME. EMERY, AM I CORRECT? YOU TOLD THEM EVERYTHING? BUT THEY TRICKED ME, THEY TRICKED ME. I'M SORRY WE HAD TO LET A MAN LIKE ROGASH LIVE. WE DIDN'T.
