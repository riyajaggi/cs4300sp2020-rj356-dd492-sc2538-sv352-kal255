 Man: GOOD AFTERNOON, MR. BRIGGS. A CRITICAL ELECTION IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE IN VOLARIA. SHOULD THE POLICE-CONTROLLED NATIONALISTS WIN OVER THE LIBERTY PARTY, THE COUNTRY WILL BECOME A TERRORIST DICTATORSHIP. WE HAVE INFORMATION THAT, TO ENSURE THEIR VICTORY, THE NATIONALISTS HAVE FIXED THE VOTING MACHINES IN THE KEY 12th DISTRICT. MR. BRIGGS, YOUR MISSION, SHOULD YOU DECIDE TO ACCEPT IT, WOULD BE TO UNFIX THE ELECTION SO THAT THE RESULT WILL HONESTLY REFLECT THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE.

 THE SECRETARY INSTRUCTS YOU THAT NO CITIZEN OF VOLARIA MAY BE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED. AND AS ALWAYS, SHOULD YOU OR ANY OF YOUR I.M. FORCE BE CAUGHT OR KILLED, HE WILL DISAVOW ANY KNOWLEDGE OF YOUR ACTIONS. PLEASE DISPOSE OF THIS RECORDING AS USUAL. Dan: WHY NOT A VOTING MACHINE? NO POINT IN USING AN AMERICAN ONE. THEIRS ARE DIFFERENT. THIS HAS THE SAME SORT OF SELF-CONTAINED ELECTROMECHANICAL DEVICE -- COUNTERS AND GEARING MECHANISM WITH A CLOSE TOLERANCE. THE SECRET IS IN THE WHEELS. CAN YOU BEAT THEM, BARNEY?

 HE CAN. IF I GAIN ACCESS IN TIME. WHERE ARE THE VOTING MACHINES NOW? COME OVER HERE. THE MACHINES ARE LOCKED IN A BACK ROOM OF THE POLLING PLACE -- THE 12th DISTRICT POLICE STATION, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE NATIONALIST PARTY HEADQUARTERS. ROLLIN, YOU'RE THE VOTER. WHO AM I? THAT'S UP TO CINNAMON, SO LONG AS HE'S REGISTERED. HOW DO WE FIND HIM? THE ELECTION IS THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. WHEN IN DOUBT, ASK A POLICEMAN. [ SHOUTING ] STOP! LOCK THEM UP! LOCK THEM UP! LOCK THEM UP! AHH! [ YELLING ] YES, MISS? I-I DON'T KNOW QUITE WHERE TO BEGIN. I'M A STRANGER HERE IN YOUR CITY, AND I WANT TO REPORT A -- WELL, I'M NOT SURE HOW TO -- A CRIME. YES, MISS? WHAT KIND OF CRIME? I FEEL SO SILLY. NOTHING LIKE THIS HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE. I WAS ON THE RIVIERA. IT WAS JUST BEFORE EASTER, AND I MET A MAN, A VERY CHARMING MAN, AND I FELL IN LOVE. I AM CERTAIN HE DID, TOO, MISS...? BLOCK. CATHERINE BLOCK. CAPTAIN TREZ, AT YOUR SERVICE. PLEASE, HOW CAN WE HELP YOU? IT'S SO EMBARRASSING. THE POLICE STATION IS NO PLACE FOR MODESTY, MISS. PLEASE, SIT DOWN. [ SOBBING ] EDWARD...HE SAID HIS NAME WAS EDWARD GERMAINE. HE...ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM. BUT HE SAID HE NEEDED MONEY FOR BUSINESS, AND I GAVE IT TO HIM. HOW MUCH? A HALF A MILLION FRANCS. NOW...I CAME HERE... FOR THE WEDDING... AND I CAN'T FIND HIM. [ SOBBING ] I'M SORRY. IT APPEARS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY ONE OF THE OLDEST AND CRUELEST OF CONFIDENCE GAMES. [ SOBBING ] THANK YOU. Man: LET ME GO! LET ME GO! A GREAT ORATOR. SPECIAL PRISONER. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN TREZ. YOU'VE BEEN VERY KIND. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HELP ME? WITH YOUR ROMANCE? NO. IN FINDING THIS MAN? YES. WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT FILE SYSTEM ON EVERY ADULT IN THE DISTRICT. HERE YOU ARE, MISS. PHOTOGRAPHS AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU MAY NEED. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN TREZ. YOU'RE VERY EFFICIENT. THE TIMES DEMAND IT, MISS. MACHINE'S FIXED, ALL RIGHT. THE LIBERTY PARTY AND THE NATIONALIST PARTY. THE NATIONALIST PARTY STARTS OUT WITH A 2,000-VOTE ADVANTAGE. 2,000 VOTES OUGHT TO BE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO SWING IT. THEY GOT TWO MACHINES, BUT HOW DO THEY MAKE THE TOTALS MATCH THE NUMBER OF VOTERS? ON THIS LIBERTY WHEEL, THERE ARE THREE ZEROS, SO THAT THE FIRST 2,000 VOTES COUNTED WILL JUST BE TURNED BACK TO ZERO. THE FIRST 2,000 VOTES WON'T BE RECORDED. SO TO MAKE THE ELECTION HONEST, TOMORROW YOU'LL HAVE TO SUBTRACT 2,000 VOTES FROM THE NATIONALISTS AND ADD THEM TO THE LIBERTADISTS. RIGHT. CAN YOU DO IT? WELL, I CAN'T DO IT NOW. EVERY MACHINE HAS ITS OWN, SPECIAL RESET SHAFT. SO WHAT I'LL HAVE TO DO IS MOLD A SPECIAL WRENCH DRIVER FOR THIS ONE. HAVE YOU FOUND SOMETHING? NO. I-I THOUGHT I HAD, BUT I MADE A MISTAKE. TO BE SAFE, I BETTER GET ANOTHER IMPRESSION. NO TIME. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. NO EDWARD GERMAINE. THAT IS UNFORTUNATE. BUT IF I CAN BE OF ANY FURTHER SERVICE, IN ANY WAY... THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. YOU-YOU'VE BEEN VERY KIND. I DO KNOW WHERE TO FIND YOU. A PLOT? WHAT KIND OF PLOT? HOW DO YOU KNOW? HOW?! THEY TOOK THE TEAR GAS, COMMANDANT. YES, CAPITAN, THEY TOOK THE TEAR GAS. BUT TODAY IS THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. WHAT ABOUT THE VOTING MACHINES IN THE NEXT ROOM? MARTEL, STEVEN. M-A-R-T-E-L. OH, HE'S NOT REGISTERED. WELL, THERE WAS A BOOKSTORE OWNER -- MIGUEL CORDOVA. HERE IT IS. [ DOOR OPENS ] Dan: GET HIM A DRINK. ALL RIGHT, BARNEY. TAKE IT EASY, PAL. LIE DOWN. HOW BAD IS IT? WE'LL SEE IN A MINUTE. [ BARNEY GASPS ] THE BULLET WENT THROUGH CLEAN. TRY TO MOVE YOUR ARM. NO BROKEN BONES. ANY CHANGE IN THE PLAN? HOW DO YOU FEEL? I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. NO CHANGE. GET YOUR VOTER? I THINK SO. GOOD GIRL. REMOVE THE BACK. ONE MOMENT, PLEASE. YES. MAY I HELP YOU? [ With accent ] YOU SEEM TO HAVE AN INTERESTING SELECTION OF BOOKS. YES, I TRY TO. DO YOU FILL POSTAL ORDERS? YES, IF THEY'RE PREPAID. MAY I HAVE YOUR MAILING ADDRESS? OF COURSE. WE HAVE EXAMINED THE MACHINES, COMMANDANT. THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TOUCHED. I HAVE POSTED A FOUR-MAN GUARD ON THEM, AND THEY WILL BE CHECKED AGAIN IN THE MORNING. YOU MENTIONED A YOUNG WOMAN. YOU SAID YOU WERE TALKING TO A YOUNG WOMAN WHEN THE POLICE OFFICERS ENTERED THE CELLBLOCK. THAT IS CORRECT, COMMANDANT. SHE WAS REPORTING A CRIME. SHE HAD BEEN VICTIMIZED IN A CONFIDENCE GAME. A CONFIDENCE GAME? IS IT CLEAN? SEEMS TO BE. I BETTER CHECK. THANKS, CINNAMON. HOW'S IT GOING, BARNEY? LITTLE THROB. KEEPS YOUR MIND CLEAR. LET'S TRY IT. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] HELLO? GOOD. DAN SAYS CORDOVA'S OUR MAN. [ DOORBELL BUZZES ] [ DOORBELL BUZZES ] WHO IS IT? CAPTAIN TREZ. HOW ARE YOU, MISS BLOCK? MAY I COME IN? OH, YES. YES, OF COURSE. THANK YOU. YOU, UH, HAVE NEWS FOR ME, CAPTAIN? WE WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH YOU AT HEADQUARTERS. ABOUT EDWARD? ABOUT MANY THINGS. I HOPE IT WON'T INCONVENIENCE YOU. OH, NO. IT WON'T INCONVENIENCE ME AT ALL. AT HEADQUARTERS? PLEASE. WELL, IT'S ALL OVER NOW. LET EDWARD ENJOY THE MONEY. I THINK I LEARNED SOMETHING. [ LAUGHING ] WHY DID YOU COME TO THE 12th DISTRICT POLICE STATION, MISS BLOCK? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. WHY? THERE ARE OTHER STATIONS IN THE CITY. OH, YES. WELL, THE ADDRESS EDWARD GAVE ME -- IT WAS IN THIS DISTRICT. WHAT WAS THAT ADDRESS? WELL, THE ADDRESS DIDN'T EXIST. WHEN I GOT THERE, THERE WAS NO SUCH PLACE. BUT YOU DO REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS? 112 VIA JEROME. DO YOU HAVE ANY OF THIS MAN'S -- OF EDWARD GERMAINE'S -- LETTERS? NO. I DESTROYED THEM. DESTROYED THEM? THEY WERE UNPLEASANT REMINDERS. OF COURSE. YES, OF COURSE. TO YOU, THEY WERE TOKENS OF LOVE BETRAYED. THANK YOU FOR COMING TO SEE ME. THANK YOU, COMMANDANT. CAPTAIN TREZ. YOU ARE RIGHT. SHE IS VERY CHARMING. PUT HER UNDER CLOSE SURVEILLANCE. YES? THEY LET ME GO, DAN, BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE THINKING. IT'S TOO LATE TO CHANGE PLANS NOW. WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG? [ With accent ] HELP ME. HELP ME, PLEASE. THE POLICE -- I FEAR FOR MY LIFE. IN THERE, QUICKLY. WHAT IS IT THE POLICE WANT YOU FOR? DEPORTATION... BACK TO EASTERN EUROPE. IF THEY SEND ME BACK...

IF YOU WANT TO BRING CHARGES, BRING THEM. OTHERWISE, GET OUT. YOU ARE A STUPID MAN. YOU CANNOT HELP ANNA KROHL. SHE WILL DIE IN A LABOR CAMP. ALL YOU CAN DO IS DESTROY YOURSELF. IT'S ALL RIGHT. YES, YES. I WILL TAKE YOU TO VIA FLORES. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] HELLO? LET ME HELP YOU, BARNEY. NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT, WILLY. NO. THANKS ANYWAY. I CAN MAKE IT. I JUST WANT TO GET TO THE TABLE. [ GRUNTS ] FORGIVE ME. THE PAPERS TOOK SO LONG. MIGUEL... THE ENGRAVER SAID THERE WAS A SMALL BOAT LEAVING THE PORT THIS EVENING. I HATE TO ASK YOU TO PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER, BUT I -- ANNA, THERE IS NO OTHER WAY. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN. A GEAR HAS SHATTERED AND FOULED THE COUNTERS.
