HELLO, CRYSTAL. DAN! OH, NO. NO, NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT, NO! CRYSTAL. IT'S NOT FAIR. DON'T EVEN DISCUSS IT. I WON'T DO IT! I HAVEN'T ASKED YOU TO DO ANYTHING YET. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO. I KNOW IT AND I KNOW YOU. LOOK, IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS SINCE I SAW YOU LAST, AND THAT WAS ON BUSINESS, AND SO WAS THE TIME BEFORE THAT. SO WHATEVER IT IS, I WON'T DO IT! NOW -- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BIGGEST CONTRACT OF MY CAREER. CENTER GARDEN, TOP BILLING, MY OWN PACKAGE. COMPLETE CREATIVE CONTROL, AND I'M NOT GONNA GIVE IT UP! CRYSTAL -- I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. I'M SURE IT'S IMPORTANT. I'M SURE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. DESPERATELY URGENT. STOP! CRYSTAL, LISTEN -- GO AWAY! I'M NOT INTERESTED IN ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO SAY! IT'S JUST NOT FAIR! HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF CARDINAL VOSSEK? NO! YES. THEN YOU KNOW WHAT THAT ONE OLD MAN MEANS IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD FOR HIS WORK -- PLEASE! [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] I NEED YOU, CRYSTAL. I DON'T CARE.

ONCE YOU GET OUT OF THE CELL, CAN YOU GET TO VOSSEK? WELL, IF EVERYTHING GOES LIKE CLOCKWORK AND THE GUARDS STICK TO THEIR SCHEDULES, YEAH. THEY WILL. THAT'S YOUR EDGE. NO ONE HAS EVER BROKEN OUT OF SERAVNO. THE PRISON STAFF HAS GOT TO BE BORED AND INDIFFERENT, WITH YEARS OF PRISON DUTY WITH NO TROUBLE. BUT I STILL HAVE TO KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS TO THE SPLIT SECOND. THEY WON'T LET YOU KEEP YOUR WATCH. ARE THERE ANY CLOCKS IN THE PRISON? NO, BUT WE'LL PROVIDE A TIMEPIECE JUST AS GOOD. BARNEY. WELL, I NEED A CROSSBOW, A RIGGER TRUCK, AND WILLY. CRYSTAL...

[ GRUNTS ] GOOD. [ MUSIC STOPS ] CARDINAL VOSSEK'S BEEN ORDERED EXECUTED. WHEN? NO DATE HAS BEEN SET. THEY'LL TRY TO BREAK HIM FIRST. WILL THEY? NO. WE HAVE A PROBLEM. WHAT? I'VE TIMED IT SIX TIMES. IT TAKES 20 MINUTES TO STRIKE AND LOAD CRYSTAL'S SAFETY NET. NO WAY TO CUT THE TIME? NO. CRYSTAL? YES, DAN. BETTER SPEND MORE TIME REHEARSING YOUR TRAPEZE ACT. WHY?

THIS IS NOT A RESORT. TAKE HIM TO HIS CELL. WHAT IS THAT THING? EYELASH CURLER. [ SCOFFS ] THAT'S THE MOST DIABOLICAL-LOOKING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT I'VE EVER SEEN.

Tell me nothing. Come with me, and I'll prove to you I can get you out of this place. But...why should I believe you? Faith, sir. How can a prince of the Church argue with that? CARDINAL VOSSEK, HE IS NOT AT HOME. HOWEVER, HE IS EXPECTED SHORTLY. THANK YOU, YOUR EMINENCE. NOW FIX YOUR BEDCOVERS TO MAKE THEM LOOK LIKE A MAN ASLEEP. [ MUSIC CONTINUES ] VERY GOOD, YOUR EMINENCE. THANK YOU, BUT WHILE IN MY UNDERWEAR, I THINK I WOULD PREFER "ANTON." [ AUDIENCE APPLAUDING ] [ AUDIENCE MEMBER WHISTLES ] [ MUSIC CONTINUES ] [ GRUNTING ] OLD AGE. [ MUSIC CONTINUES ] IT WILL WORK. HOW? HOW DO WE GET DOWN? HOW DO WE CROSS THAT FENCE...

[ BELL TOLLING ] VOSSEK. VOSSEK! OPEN IT. WHAT IS IT? NOTHING. GO BACK TO SLEEP. [ TOLLING ] SIGNOR ALBERTI. YES. I CHECKED WITH THE LOCAL ARTISTS' REPRESENTATIVE. HE DOESN'T KNOW YOUR TROUPE. YOU'RE NOT LISTED IN HIS FILES, HIS PLAYBILLS, OR HIS PUBLICITY... ANYWHERE. NO, WE'RE MUCH TOO SMALL A TROUPE FOR THAT, AND THE GUILD DUES ARE VERY HIGH -- TERRIBLE. THEN YOU'VE NEVER PERFORMED HERE BEFORE? NO, BUT I'M GLAD WE CAME. WE'RE DOING VERY GOOD BUSINESS. WHERE DO YOU COME FROM? [ LAUGHING ] WHERE DOES ANY CIRCUS TROUPE COME FROM? WHEREVER IT WAS YESTERDAY. I COME FROM CESSNA, IF THAT IS WHAT YOU MEAN. MY PARTNER COMES FROM ANTURENE. AND THE MAN WHO WAS ARRESTED? THE THIEF? I PICK UP CASUALS TO DO MY RIGGING FOR ME ALL THE TIME. THEY NEVER LAST TOO LONG. AND SOME, LIKE THIS ONE, ARE THIEVES. SOME CHASE THE WOMEN. ALMOST ALL OF THEM DRINK. WE DON'T FIND TOO MANY ALTAR BOYS TO WORK THE CARNIVAL BUSINESS. BUT I'LL FIND ANOTHER MAN. HMM? YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE THIS MAN BEHIND? IF I HAVE TO. I'LL TRY TO HELP HIM. HE WAS A VERY GOOD RIGGER, AND, UH... WAS NOT TOO BAD A SORT. I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK TOO BAD OF ALL CARNIVAL PEOPLE. I MYSELF COME FROM A VERY OLD FAMILY. MY MOTHER WAS -- I'M SURE. HOW LONG DO YOU EXPECT TO STAY IN SERAVNO? WE'LL BE LEAVING VERY SOON. MORE AND MORE OF THE AUDIENCE ARE REPEATS. THEY DON'T THROW ANYTHING INTO THE HAT THE SECOND TIME.

AND THE FOOD. HOW IS THE FOOD? TERRIBLE. BUT I DON'T SEEM VERY HUNGRY. I ALSO HAVE A BIT OF... [ Normal voice ] TROUBLE SLEEPING. [ Normal voice ] ANYTHING ELSE? NO. JUST CONVERSATION FOR EFFECT. [ SIGHS ] SIGNORINA, LAWYER, CHOICE, BEATEN, NOT HUNGRY. VOSSEK IS WEAK BUT WILLING. HE HAS THE PATROLS TIMED AND NO TROUBLE WITH THE LOCKS. WHAT TIME WILL HE BE READY FOR ME? HE HAD A BIT OF TROUBLE SLEEPING. "SLEEPING" IS "30," DAN, REMEMBER? "A BIT OF TROUBLE" IS "SEVEN." 7:30. POST BOND... THIS EVENING. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Man: COME IN. YES, SIR? CAPTAIN, I WANT YOU TO INTENSIFY VOSSEK'S INTERROGATION. CARDINAL VOSSEK IS AN OLD MAN. HE IS VERY WEAK. HE MIGHT EASILY DIE. THAT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. I RECEIVED ORDERS TO EXECUTE HIM IN 48 HOURS. HEY, MIND READER, WHAT'S YOUR HURRY? [ With accent ] OH, HELLO. WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK? TWO, PLEASE. [ With accent ] GIVE ME A DRINK. ONE MORE...PLEASE.
