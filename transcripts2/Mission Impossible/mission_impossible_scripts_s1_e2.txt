 Mission: Impossible (1966â€“1973): Season 1, Episode 2 - Memory - full transcript 
 The IMF's target is Janos Karq, a top official of an unnamed Soviet Bloc country. Briggs enlists the help of Joseph Baresh, an alcoholic performer who has a photographic memory. Baresh will pose as an agent code-named Sparrow, who has never been apprehended by the authorities of Karq's country. (The real Sparrow has died, a fact not generally known.) The idea is that Baresh will be captured and provide information implicating Karq as a traitor. Barney, Cinnamon and Willy, along with Briggs, will engage in an unsuccessful (and fake) attempt to free Sparrow. That move will encourage the authorities to believe Baresh's story, ensuring Karq's demise. But Baresh gets a look at a list of agents in the employ of Karq's nation. Now, Briggs must stage a second escape attempt, this time for real. Rollin Hand, initially passed over for this mission, will play a small, but vital, role.

 HE'S BEEN TRYING TO START A WAR AND SUCCEEDING, EVER SINCE HE EXTERMINATED HIS OPPOSITION. JANOS KARQ, THE BUTCHER OF THE BALKANS. WHEN I GO TO SLEEP, I ALWAYS COVER MYSELF WITH A POLITICAL PAGE. IT'S SOMEHOW WARMER. AS USUAL, ASSASSINATION IS OUT, AS A MATTER OF POLICY. THAT'S TOO BAD, YOU KNOW. WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DESTROY KARQ POLITICALLY BY MAKING HIM APPEAR TO BE A TRAITOR. AND THE REST IS UP TO HIS OWN PEOPLE. KARQ'S HEAD OF INTELLIGENCE IS A MAN NAMED DIMITRI SOSKA. FOR YEARS, SOSKA HAS BEEN SEARCHING FOR AN AGENT CODE-NAMED "SPARROW." IN A FEW DAYS, SOSKA WILL CAPTURE SPARROW, WHO, WHEN QUESTIONED, WILL REVEAL THAT KARQ HAS BEEN WORKING WITH US, SELLING OUT HIS OWN COUNTRY. WHERE IS SPARROW? HE DIED MONTHS AGO, BUT SOSKA DOESN'T KNOW THAT. I SEE. HE'S GOING TO RETURN FROM THE DEAD. WHEN HE'S CAPTURED, HE'LL BE TAKEN TO SOSKA'S HEADQUARTERS AT LABYANKA MILITARY PRISON. THEY'RE NOT FOOLS, YOU KNOW. THEY'LL NEVER BELIEVE ANY SUCH THING ABOUT KARQ. OF COURSE NOT. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE A RESCUE ATTEMPT -- ELABORATE, WELL-TIMED, INGENIOUS, I HOPE. WE'LL GET ALL THE WAY IN, BUT WE'LL FAIL. NORMALLY, SPARROW'S INFORMATION WILL BE DISBELIEVED AND WRITTEN OFF. BUT SINCE WE'RE GOING INTO A MAXIMUM-SECURITY PRISON, HOW WILL THEY BUY THE UNBELIEVABLE FACT THAT JANOS KARQ IS A TRAITOR? AND LATER, THEY LET SPARROW LIVE. WE'D TRY TO NEGOTIATE HIS FREEDOM. ALL THIS WATER, YOU KNOW. I'M NOT SO SURE MY SYSTEM CAN STAND THE SHOCK. I HAVEN'T MET ALL OF YOU UNTIL TODAY. YOUR REASONS FOR DOING THIS WORK MAY NOT BE MINE. IT DOESN'T MATTER.
