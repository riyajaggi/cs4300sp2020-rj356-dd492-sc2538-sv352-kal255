 Previously on "Being Human"... Look, I can deal with this pregnancy. If you want out, this is the time. Celine, are you gonna tell me what's wrong? I had lung cancer years ago. It's back. Bishop! (Grunting) Prepare for what's coming. A door. A portal. It takes you beyond. It pops up when it's time for you to mosey. This is all so sudden. I'm not mentally prepared.

 - You've been waiting for this. - I wish you could come. See you in 60 years. (Screaming) (Grunting) (Screaming) Stay with me. Come on, man! (Wheezing) It's OK, Aidan. It's OK. Just stay awake. Stay awake, I'm right here. Oh my God! Aidan? What the hell happened? OK, um, get Jason down here with a large bore IV. I need to start a line.

 Tell Martha to clear an OR. No, just blood. Sit back. We've got you. Nora, he needs a transfusion. Go! Now! (Panting) (Aidan wheezing) Listen, I told you there are things I can't explain. This is your secret? No operating room, no doctor. Just blood. Please. Please. This shouldn't have worked, for so many reasons. But for a little while, for this excellent moment in time, it did work, didn't it? And I felt human, alive. (Bell ringing) But you were right. A secret breaks things down. It's like bile... dark, corrosive. Hi. I don't ha... I don't have any money. Oh... (Barking) Don't bother running, pup. You know we'll catch you. Full moon's not for another 2 weeks. What is this? Look at that. You really don't know, do you? Well... this... (Grunting) is how the world works. (Gasping) You and the other dogs down there and all of us way up here. (Panting) What are you? God's little creatures. (Gasping) (Grunting) (Grunting) - Marcus. - Woof woof! Marcus! Aidan. Can you believe this? You can't even get a cup of coffee without running into a mutt these days. So you beat him up 2 weeks before he turns? (Laughing) You might as well beat up a little girl. Bishop would be so proud. (Grunting) (Kicking) (Sighing) (Grunting) It's a long story, and most of it's unbelievable.

(Panting) (Footsteps approaching) Josh. It's OK. We met last night. Celine. Sorry, I'm just a little... I don't know what I am. (Sighing) I'm sorry. Go home, sleep, eat something. No, I can't leave him. You'll be more help to him rested. There are things... There's a thing... out there... that wants to kill him. Something you couldn't possibly understand. Bishop and the vampires? I've understood for quite a long time ago, Josh. But don't worry. I know how to handle Bishop. Go home. Have you been here all night? I guess I left around 2:00 or 3:00, right around the time it became clear that you weren't gonna tell me anything. I'm sorry. (Sniffs) I appreciate what you did. I know you went against protocol. Josh, I completely sent protocol to hell! God, if anyone found out... Whatever, it's done. But if I'm gonna do this, if I'm gonna put my job and... I don't know... my life... If I'm gonna take these kinds of risks... you gotta tell me if it's worth it. I don't know what to say. Really? I'm keeping this baby. I wasn't sure, but I am. Nora, that's great! I think... That's amazing! Yeah, yeah, it would be... if I felt like I had a partner. But I'm beginning to realize that maybe I don't... which is fine. But if that's the case, then I need to prepare myself. I wanna be that person for you. But you can't. You wanna be that person... but you can't. You wanna tell me the truth... but you can't. And I wanna keep being patient... but I can't. I'm sorry. (Laughing softly) Oh! He came so close. That's why it's taking so long to heal. If you had your fill of live blood, you'd be healed by now. Drink me. No. Don't be a fool. Bishop's coming for you. You can't fight him like this. Celine, I would have to drain you. I'd rather die for you than for cancer. I will heal. I just need a little time. (Breathing deeply) And I need to get home. (Horn honking, birds tweeting) (Engine stops) (Car door opening) (Horn blaring in distance) (Knocking on window) Oh! L.T.? Sully, hey. You OK? It's been a couple days since we saw you at the station. Yeah, it looks like you caught me sleeping one off. In your car? What happened to your face? Oh... (Laughs) Right. I'm gonna need a little help with that. (Screaming) Help! Help! ♪ ♪ ♪ Is Aidan OK? I know, I'm here. It sucks. Why aren't you... Above, beyond, sipping lattes on cloud nine? I missed it. I came home and... my door just... wasn't. Oh, Sally... I just can't deal with it now or I'm gonna start shooting people from a bell tower, so... I get it. On the other hand... You're... Practically a person, except not at all. My door disappears, and I can do this. Probably not a good thing, right? No, I don't know. I mean, it might be a good thing for your ability to keep up on current events and... the stock market and... Sudoku. No, it's probably not a good thing. Aidan would know. Aidan would know. (Siren wailing, horn honking in distance) I feel ridiculous. You'll feel better once you're home and an old dying lady isn't pushing you around. (Laughing) Just go ahead and sit and wait. Mommy's a little busy. (Panting) (Elevator beeping) I don't know what number. Celine. (Breathing deeply) (Panting) How well trained are you? Uh... (Clears throats and coughs) Can you deliver a simple message? (Chair scraping against floor) I... can't give a... give a message to anyone because I don't... I don't know where they are. - Mm-hmm... You know what's funny? No, I really don't. All I wanted was for Aidan to become a better vampire... to embrace his gift. And it is a gift, you understand? Sure. I selected him to create a future, and he... Well, he hates me now, doesn't he? Yeah, that never really came up. You're going to give Aidan a message for me. He and I are going to end this like the very old and dignified vampires that we are. You're going to tell him to meet me at the old garment factory 8:00 tomorrow night. Who's to say I even know where Aidan is or if he's alive? You're going to give him the message... or I will deliver something of a very different kind to your family in Ithaca. What do you think would upset your mother more, your heart or your brain on a platter? (Door opening) That's new. That's what Josh said. It's bad, right? Yeah, I think it means that... What? No, say it. I think it means that you're more tethered to the earth. So I'm stuck here, like the rest of the one-eyed crazies. You're still not solid yet. (Door closing) You're just more charged. (Laughing) I saw Bishop. He talked to me for a disturbingly long time. (Grunting) Did he hurt you? I think he would very much like to. But he... Hey, so you know, when was the last time the three of us just got together and played a really good game of Celebrity? - Josh, just say it. - He wants to meet you. Like men, like vampire men tomorrow night. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Why does he wanna meet you? - He wants to fight me. You mean kill you. Aidan, you can barely walk. This... Me and him... it's what was always gonna happen. OK, I love you, but that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. This isn't 1782 or whenever. You have a choice. We have a choice. We aren't choosing anything. We are a part of this! Josh and I are your family. Yes, and Bishop won't stop until he's torn that apart. It's not like I borrowed his car without asking. I thwarted his plan of taking over the Eastern Seaboard. (Sighing) It's better if I just do this. Tomorrow's the full moon. Josh, I saw what you did to that wolf, what your wolf did. And the vampires, they were terrified. You're more powerful than any of them. Wait, you want me... - Sally, it's not controlled. - It's not possible! It's not possible. He said he would go after my mom and dad. He said... we could leave. You, me, Sally, Nora, we... She hates me right now, but I could talk to her. You should talk to her and you should leave with her. That would be good. But you should forget about me. Sorry, but no. This is my battle, OK? End of story. So, what? We just let you go? We never see you again? What? You just go off and die? I fight. This should've happened lifetimes ago, and... I am truly sorry that it had to happen during yours. The elevator's down. Hey. Whoever says that dedication to dusting won't lead to a bright future is lying. I just sailed through H.R. Flying colours. And Fight Club face? Loved it. I know you're better than this, but it's a start. Well, I'm not that much better than this. Working in a hospital is still some variation of what my normal life was gonna be. Broom, scalpel, potato, "potahto." So thank you. And a question. (Clears throat) Why the hell are you doing this? I've been trying to, you know, be clean for years, uh, decades. Decades, really? You know there are programs. There aren't really any others like me, so I slip up and I start all over. It's isolating. It's frustrating. So when I saw you cornered and alone, I thought: "Well, it doesn't have to be that way for either one of us." So, these slip-ups... how often do they happen? OK, if we're gonna be friends, you need to stop thinking I'm gonna kill you. OK. (Birds chirping, siren wailing in distance) I know you're scared and I know you're in a family way, but we cannot not do something. I was just thinking the same thing. So what do we do? I think you're right. About the wolf? That room in the basement... if we can get Bishop down there and you can close the door and lock the two of us inside... Can you do that now? I think I can do that now. (Inhaling) Ray was right. Push comes to shove... I'm a killer. I don't know what else we're supposed to do. This is insane. (Inhaling) And yet it... it almost seems too easy, doesn't it? You mean the part where I transform into a werewolf and I attempt to murder a 500-year-old super-angry vampire? No. It doesn't seem too easy. You're a really scary werewolf. Really? Oh my God! Like super, super badass scary. So just... don't say anything to Aidan. You don't say anything to Aidan. But seriously, like, don't. Like, don't give him special looks and get all emotional and whatnot. Don't Sally-it-up. What does that even mean? (Laughing) (Sighing) (Sighing) You asked me why I didn't wait for you all those years ago. What happened? (Inhaling) I went out for a walk to get some air. I was gonna go to the train with you. He had other ideas. What did he do to you? I shouldn't have given up on you. I should've known. Celine, my God, I am so sorry. Don't be. I'm ready to leave, Aidan. But I can't die until I know you'll truly live. Take your life back... for both of us. (Sniffs) Oh! (Crow cawing in distance) (Siren wailing in distance) He'll fight you, but he wants to do it here. There's a room in the basement. No one can hear you down there. Same time. Oh, and just for the record, the fact that you're in this car with a stay-in-school bumper sticker is just so wrong in so many ways. Good boy. You know you didn't have to do that. You know we don't... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just humour me, OK? I'm turning into a wolf, you're going off to your big awful battle. I feel like it's the night of a big football game or something, like state. - Did you even play football? - I went to the games. - Yeah. - You know what we should do? We should join one of those local farm-delivery programs. It would be good. I'd cook more, be involved. It would be good. They'd send you a bunch of kale. Yes, kale's great. It's good for digestion. (Laughing) (Aidan inhaling and exhaling) What time is it? It's almost 6:00. (Inhaling) Where are you turning tonight? The woods. Then you're gonna go to Ithaca and see your family and make sure that they're OK. You guys are coming back, right... after you do whatever it is you have to do? - Yeah. - Sure I don't wanna be here without you guys. We'll be back. And we'll join that farm thing. It'll be awesome. (Sighing) We should really... Yeah. (Dishes hitting counter) So I guess we should've started a little slower with the whole being-normal thing, huh? (Laughing softly) Do you need a ride tonight or... No, I'm good, I'm good. You go. (Inhaling and exhaling) (Sniffs) Good luck tonight.

(Shouting, indistinct) (Grunting) (Groaning) You will hate me no more! (Groaning) (Grunting) (Screaming) (Groaning) Now, you know you can't do a damn thing with that. Now hand it over, little girl. (Gasps) (Gasping) I told you to change. I begged you to change. (Gasping) It didn't have to be this way. (Gasping) (Gasping): It did. (Gasping) (Gasping) (Screaming) (Gasps) (Breathing deeply) (Panting) (Horns honking) (Cawing) If I'd known this would happen... I thought the baby was OK. I was so relieved it was OK. (Sighing) I'm so sorry. I should've told you sooner, prepared you. I wouldn't have believed you. And there's no way to prepare for this. What I saw... you have to go through that... every month? It looks incredibly painful. And there's no cure? I'm trying to find out. But right now... no. How did it happen to you? I was in the mountains with my friend. And we thought it was some kind of animal. And I guess it was, but... it killed my friend, Stu. (Whispering): Oh my God! And scratched me. And just a scratch was enough? After what you saw, what I put you though... I can understand if you don't wanna be with me. This is gonna sound crazy, but... I felt like I was finally seeing you. And now that I know... Maybe we'll be OK. Maybe we'll be OK. (Sighing) I should get back to the house. - Yeah. - Check on some things. Is that OK? I'll come right back. I'll come back later. OK. OK. (Sighing) (Door opening and closing) No, no, no. Get out, get out! Oh my Go. We should get cable. Right. And paint. Hell, wallpaper. What's the landlord gonna say, right? Exactly. (Laughing) (Clears throat) You two really shouldn't have done that. It's not that we didn't think you could take him. 'Cause I could've. You know that, right? I do. I do. So how was your night? This is a conversation to be had over kale. (Laughing) How was your night? I mean... I mean, God! Congratulations, you're free. Yeah, what are you gonna do? I think I wanna learn krav maga. I actually can't believe that you don't already know that. Do you wanna come? You could audit, pick up some skills, fight ghost crime. I like it. I like it. Mmm... - Mmm... - What are you gonna do? Oh, now that I'm here forever? Look, you don't know that for sure. No. But since I am here... no more waiting. I'm gonna do something with my time. You know? I mean, maybe I got closure with Danny, but I never got closure with my family, my friends. So you're just gonna haunt them, basically? Basically, yeah. - Mmm... - That's what it sounds like. And we're all gonna be supernatural krav-maga crime fighters. (Laughing) (Door buzzer) Did you order a stripper? Actually, since our last party was so rudely interrupted, I thought it might be fun to watch you eat pizza. (Laughing) Oh God! This guy. Hello. Gegeman. You're looking well. I have you to thank for that. You've come a long way to thank me when there was no need. But there is. You've saved us a lot of trouble by slaying Bishop. It had to be done. And you're honourable.

I just don't see the point. You know what your problem is? You don't wanna believe that this is your life. You are very much correct. But it is your life. So why punish ourselves? Think about it.
