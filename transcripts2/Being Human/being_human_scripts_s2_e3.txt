 Previously on Being Human. Oh! Sorry! Do you work here? I'm trying. I'm applying for my residency. Last call. How is it you get stuck minding - the errant princess again? - I will work for you, but I could never be like you. This force comes rushing out. I think it actually flew out. - Hegeman. - Nora's wolf killed him.

 Do you remember anything about being a wolf? - Should I? - I'm not going to med school. I need to fix this. I need to try and fix this for you. One thing monsters and humans have in common is the fact that they're both capable of destruction. We all leave a ton of carnage in our wake. You want me to change in here? Yeah. Or-- or the one next door. I rented, uh, both units. So there's this one too. Sally will lock us up tomorrow night and before we change.

 And we'll wolf out together, but separately, safe and sound. And you're OK doing this? - She doesn't have a life. - Hurtful. Yes, but untrue? I'll-- I'll build us something so that we can lock ourselves up next time. Because, as we all know, for the wolf, convenience... is key. Are you sure that we have to do this? We already changed together once and we're alive to tell the tale. It's for the best. But this is only my 2nd time. I'm still trying to make sense of what this is, what I am now. And I don't know if this makes sense. Well, it's not just about safety. It's about, uh, research too. Hello, 1993. Why don't I give you kids a minute? So you're seriously gonna tape us? When this first happened to me, all I could think about was finding a cure. And then I met Aidan and we launched into this whole let's-pretend- to-be-human thing and I forgot that I wanted to fix this, that I wanted to actually be human again. And when I scratched you, when I-- When I did this to you-- OK. OK? I will let a ghost lock me in a storage unit so that you can videotape me while I take my clothes off and turn into an animal. Yeah, that sounded as creepy as I thought it would. The difference is that a human feels bad about the pain they cause. They want to repair the damage, put a Band-aid on it. It might not be that easy. The quick fix doesn't always work. Once you've opened some doors, you can never close them again. What's with the sleep-peeping? I was not... sleep-peeping. Is that-- What? Um, my ex used to watch me sleep. Thought it was sweet, until he turned out to be dead inside. I'm sorry. That's OK. We all have bad breakups behind us. So, tomorrow is someone's big first day. Are you nervous? Ah... Yes, you are! You're nervous. Is it going to be weird working together? Well, in a big maze like City Hospital, we'll probably never see each other. Hmm... It's just that we're having a good time with this. I don't wanna screw it up. Can I, uh, can I say something? Mm-hmm. I am... kind of looking forward to running into you in the halls. You do realize that if we run into each other in the hallways, it'll be because we're trying to stop someone from bleeding out. That's right. Yeah. A monster, a real monster, doesn't give a damn about the havoc it wreaks, the blood it spills. Hey, you know, I'm gonna get something. Hurry up. The hardest thing about knowing you're capable of inflicting pain, death even, is constantly trying to avoid doing such a thing, especially when every fiber of your being wants to hurt and consume everyone it comes into contact with. Are you OK? I'm good! Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com I just don't think it's right, you putting her in storage. I'm not leaving her in a well. And I'm getting locked up too, remember? Well, well, well! Nice to see you among us day walkers. And what did Princess Suren-- I love saying that, by the way-- Have you doing that you were a half hour late for your shift? I know I haven't been around a lot lately, but my life isn't just about the... Princess Suren. Nice. I have other stuff going on. Other-- What other stuff? Ha! Are you doing this other stuff with another person, and if so, is that person female? And if so, are you doing that other stuff with her "vagua". Uh... OK, OK. I am seeing someone. It is a woman, and she has a pulse. - Sweet! - Are we sure this a good idea? Why you gotta be a jerk? It's a valid question. I'm not trying to be a wet blanket, but the last person you dated was Rebecca. I know. Thank you very much. Well, and that ended badly... With death, with lots of death. It won't be like that this time because... I have more control now. OK, when do we get to meet her or when does Josh get to meet her and I get to stand there and judge her silently? OK, I don't know if we're at that point yet. Ah, so what point are you at? You're at a point. We hang out, we enjoy each other's company and then we go back to our lives. It's easy, it's casual, and above all else, it's normal, and that is what I need right now. When you say "enjoying each other's company," that's code for "tapping that ass," yes, to be clear? You are a classy lady. We've all been through a lot this past year. If you've got yourself under control, why shouldn't you get a shot at happiness? Well, thank you. Yes, I approve. And I didn't ask for your approval. But you wanted it. No, I don't want it. It's written all over your face. Leave me alone! You, out. Nurse ghost? Cute. Your shift's over, sweet. I'm not dead yet. Now go. No unauthorized ghosts in the nursery. You're not dead and you're talking to me? You can see me? How can you see me? Second sight, 6th sense. It's a gift. It's a curse. Crazy stuff. Now get in line with the others. Uh, I'm not... Line. Now! Hey, Terry. Could I use your key card? It won't work either. They've tightened security. Only shift supervisor can get in the supply. - Why? - They think some idiot has been selling blood to junkies for drug tests. Administration's got a bug way up their ass about it. Sorry. What kind of power trip is that nurse on? We're ghosts. We can go wherever we want. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You do not want to piss off the reincarnation chick. The reincarnation chick? Yeah, Zoe Gonzalez! If she thinks you're worthy, she can get you reincarnated. Like Buddha style? Yeah! A couple years back, my cousin Joey turned into a Korean girl named Nancy. So why are we waiting in line? Let's just do it. No, no, no. Zoe salts the nursery door. She even comes in on her days off to lay the stuff down to keep the nutty ghosts out. I mean, even if she didn't, you can't just jump into any kid. It's gotta be the right one, one of the sickly ones. Your energy has to meet with their energy, giving them that boost they need, you know, that life force to stay alive. Besides, people like us, it freaks them out. You need Zoe to help them accept our spirit. That's why she gets to say who goes in and who doesn't. She's a little bit of a picky hard-ass, so I'd watch out if I was you. Mmm! I love your room. Mmm! You want a tour? Maybe in the morning. One second, one second. I forgot something. I, um, OK. I forgot that I got something for you. It's for tomorrow. It is vintage. - Mm-hmm? - It-- You know, I thought you could kick it old school and bring it back into style. - Wow! - Yeah. Oh, wow! Yeah. Yeah? Wait, wait. Oh, yeah.

Aidan, was that a feminine voice that I heard up in your room? 'Cause I was kind of hoping it wasn't you. Is that your casual lady? You're not calling her that. Hey, wait. Is that how you're controlling your urges? It's a working hypothesis, Josh. It seems very risky to me. Could you kill someone else's mood and let me enjoy this? This is my last bag! All right.

I can hear somebody having sex. And they are really going to town! Yeah, well, you don't really need super hearing for that one. Oh my! Is that Aidan? Yeah. I didn't know the walls were so thin. Well, maybe we should give them a run for their money. Yeah, you're just, um... That's-- that's the wolf feeling. You're very wolfy right now. Well, so what? You're feeling wolfy too.

I've decided to be reincarnated. Sally's decided to be reincarnated. Hmm? Oh! Hilarious. I'm not seeing the humor in this. What's funny about it is that reincarnation isn't real. And even if it were, you would be way too chicken to go through with it. It is real and it happens right under your noses at the hospital. And I'm gonna do it, so I'd appreciate some support. Sally, calm down. Whoa, we got company upstairs so please put a lid on this stuff. Wait, there's company? Your girl is still here? I would've made more frittata! Josh? Julia. Oh, wait. Ho-- You're-- you're that Julia? His Ju-- Julia the fiancé! I'm not his. He, uh... He left me. Julia! Julia, wait. Stop for a second, please. I don't know what to say. I'm sorry for back there, I... couldn't believe it was you in my house. What are you doing in Boston? I got my residency at SCH. The hospital? My hospital? The one that I work at with Aidan? - Did you know? - God, no! Please don't make this any more awkward and awful for me. I'm sorry, Julia... for leaving you the way I did. You ran away! I did. I ran away. And I wish I had an explanation that you would believe, but believe me when I say it was for the best. Wait. Don't, plea-- No. Aw, salt. Seriously?

Any notion what it takes to coax a newborn spirit into accepting someone else? You're kind of amazing, by the way. How are you able to do that? I was a baby. A ghost came to me. He was terrifying, but when he started to possess me, I screamed so loud, I scared him. I often think I have a piece of him in me and that's why I'm able to see them. That's my first memory. My first memory was burning my lap with a bowl of SpaghettiOs. So why should I help you be reincarnated? Because I have a lot of awesome qualities that could really help a baby out. I was a decent person before I died, you know? I came from a good family, a loving home. Osama bin Laden came from a loving home. Means zero. I'm trying to paint a portrait of myself for you. If you're a good person, you should just wait on your door. Yeah, I kind of passed my door up. You passed up your door? I had to in order to help my roommate. I'm selfless like that. Hold up. You have roommates? I, uh, met Julia, um, in a bar. Julia doesn't go into bars. OK, uh, but she does now, so... OK. OK, and so what were you doing at the bar? What were you gonna drink? You know, I don't appreciate that. Right, because you're in control of your urges now? Were you in control when you met Julia? I was tempted at first, yes, but I haven't hurt her. I didn't hurt her. Yet. Oh God! Yeah, and how's your little hypothesis working now that you're cut off? You were happy for me. You said I deserved something normal. Yeah, I remember that. I'm so happy that you're sleeping with my ex and not eating her. I didn't know who she was, Josh. Are you gonna-- Are you gonna keep seeing her? Of course not! Believe it or not, Josh, this was never a design to hurt you. How is she? Honestly, uh... I think you did a number on her. I think-- She hasn't said anything, but there are moments where you can see the scar tissue. But she-- She bounced back, right? I mean, she's a doctor now. I always knew she'd be a great doctor. This is better. She's better. She's better now. OK, Dawson, Pacey, forget about Joey and get your A-games on. What's going on? The reincarnation lady is coming to interview you about me and make sure that I'm good to mingle with a baby soul. Did-- did you even hear what you just said? I've seen it happen! It's real and I'm doing it. I was 23 when I died. I barely got out of the gate. I watched you and Nora together at the storage unit yesterday, so in love. That's all I can do now. I'm an observer. That's all I will ever be. And now I have a shot to live again. Don't I deserve that? Boys, always be selling. Get the door. Would you like some, uh, coffee or something? Soda? Soda kills. It's so weird that we've never hung out before this. So, um, you wanna talk to us about Sally? I wanted to meet people like you. She means people like her, ordinary human beings who, for whatever reason, can speak to the dead. Right. Mm-hmm. Right. It's cr-- It's nuts, isn't it, how everything else about you can be so normal, but this-- But there's this one... ...this one thing, right? Right? - Oh, it's crazy train. - OK. Good. Now that we've bonded, maybe we should get this interview rolling. Not with you here. What? Come on, let's go. Get out. You know, it's fine. We get it. Fine. Let's begin. How'd it go? I can't help you. What did those morons say to you? Your roommates love you. They tried. They blew it! Come on, give me a chance to defend myself. It's not what they told me. It's what you didn't tell me, about your fiancé, how you almost slit his throat. Almost! I didn't, and isn't that what we should focus on? Look, he killed me and then tried to exorcize me. I was angry. You don't have any of that left? There's no anger? In my experience, a dishonest ghost is a damaged ghost. I can't work with a damaged ghost. Oh, please, please! You don't understand. I have to get away. You have a house, friends who care about you. Trust me, you've got it better than any ghost I've met. I've been seeing things lately. There's something after me. Something dark that I let loose into my world. I keep seeing it. It's hunting me. It's toying with me. Let's say this is true, and there is something after you, what's to stop it from coming after you even if I do help you? Because then, Sally, you're an infant and you're defenseless. I really am... sorry. Dr. Chan, please pick up line 5. Dr. Chan, line 5. Are you lost? What? No. Yes. Unit C? Elevator to the 3rd floor, make 2 lefts. Thanks. I wonder if this place is disorganized or I'm just stupid. I've been here for years. I still get turned around. I'm Nora, by the way. I know. I asked around. So you and Josh. I don't mean to be "blurty" like this, but apparently we're all gonna be working together, so we should get this out of the way. We've been together for a few months. He told me about what happened between the 2 of you. Then you have a better handle on the situation, because I have no idea what happened. You should really talk to Josh about this. I'm stressed enough. I don't have it in me to listen to him stammer and lie through an explanation. He was in a bad place, but he's different now. Well, when I look at him, I still see the same, old, selfish, cruel piece of garbage who ran away. It wasn't his fault. Right, and you know because he's actually spoken to you about what happened. I'm sorry. After this morning, I'm still feeling a little raw. I believe you're a nice person, but I know Josh for what he is. It's just a matter of time before he does to you what he did to me. - All right, sponge. - Here you go. - How's the breathing? - What happened to him? G.S.W. to the chest. I need some extra hands. Standby for the suction. All right. - What are our numbers? - BP, 85 over 60. Pulse, 140. OK, let's put a chest tube in. ♪ Please don't give me everything... ♪ I need suction over here. Suction! The suction, now! Ah! Mmm! Ah! What? You OK? Yeah. I'm fine. I just dozed off. You look pale... even for you. And since when do you nap? I haven't eaten and the hospital put the supply under lock and key. OK. Well, what about, uh, you know, those places where the weirdos let you drink their blood? Blood den. No. It would mean drinking live and... Plus, if certain people found out I was feeding there, they might take advantage of that and that would be very bad for everyone. So you're going cold turkey? So it would appear. Well, what happens next? Oh, what happens next is I will get sick then the hunger takes over, then you begin to act on instinct and then... you binge. OK... Let's define "binge". Am I-- Am I gonna come home and find bodies stacked like firewood? And-- and then what happens after the binge? Are you-- are you OK? Drinking live-- Drinking live is different. It's harder to stop. It's impossible to control and I will slip back, uh... to the way that I was before, which not like this. And before you were... No one that you'd ever want to meet. Hey... How'd it go with Zoe? Don't change the subject. Oh, it's been changed. How'd it go? Oh, we didn't blow it for you, did we? No, it was me. You're gonna be OK. There's probably millions of ways out of here. You'll find a way. ♪ And the ocean ♪ ♪ Tide ♪ ♪ Makes a picture of my life ♪ ♪ As you ♪ ♪ As you... ♪ Hey, there. What's your name? S. Russell. Well, hello, S. Russell. You're not freaked out by me at all, are you, sweetie? Not even a little bit. You know you can help me, don't you? You know I need to be someplace else. OK, sweetie. Zoe's not here to help, but you're being such a good baby, I think we're gonna be OK. Oh, no. Don't cry, baby. Don't cry. Don't cry. It's gonna be OK. Leave this baby alone. Are you kidding me? You were gonna jump into a baby weren't you? You were right. You'll never see me again. Wait. Why didn't you? Wouldn't have been fair. It just would've followed me. This thing that's after you, what's it look like? - Really? - Yeah, whatever. My shift's up and I have nothing else to do. So I can try to help you while I drink alone. OK, well, my friend Stevie told me that ghosts can sleep, so I had this dream. OK, can you tell this to me in a not-boring way? Hey! Check this out. I can't do this. I can't lock myself up in here. We have to. It's the only way to be safe. Well, maybe I don't wanna be safe. Maybe I wanna be free. Listen. You just need to stop and think right now. This isn't you talking. I don't care. I don't care. Every cell in my body is screaming at me to run out of here and never look back. That's the wolf. You're anxious. You'll get used to it. You just need to learn to fight it. Yeah, but what if we change together and our wolves are calm? Maybe they'll be happy together. This isn't a dog n on the common. We can't take that chance. Well, only one of us has to be locked up. I could go to the woods. Nora. You're a killer. I watched you tear someone to shreds. You have no idea the danger you put us in. I know what I did. Why didn't you tell me? Because I didn't want you to feel guilty for something that I did. OK. You were protecting me, I get that. I'm trying to protect you! No, if wanted to protect me, you would've run away before you did this to me, like you did for Julia. But me? You had no problem cursing me. I'll see you tomorrow. Hi. Hi. We're going to stop this. What? You didn't think that I was gonna throw away a friendship for this? Come on. What's wrong with you? Three weeks. We've known each other for 3 weeks. Aren't you getting a little attached? OK, look me in the eye, please, Aidan, and tell me the last few weeks haven't meant anything to you. It was just sex. Leave it alone. That's awesome... Yeah, I wanted to tell you... No! You're the first person. How are you today? And then she just hauled ass. And I looked for her at the hospital, but no dice. And I had to avoid running into Julia all day, so... You all right? I'm gonna miss you if I ever go anywhere. I want you to know that. What's with the suicide hotline talk? Where you going? Not into any babies, that's for sure. But, um, Zoe's gonna help me figure something out. Zoe with the Manson stare? I'm sure she's wonderful. You guys can go on a teen tour together. OK. Um... I'm positive... that there's another way out. I'm sure there is. Think she'll show? The moon's almost out. I do not. No, she is stridently anti storage unit. And before you were... No one that you'd ever want to meet. I remember you. Aidan, right? I can't get over how you people never change. You look exactly the same. You look good. Enough to eat, right? Come in. I'm sorry, who's this? Oh, that's Perry. He keeps an eye on me. You people have been getting a lot rougher lately. You look hungry. It's still cash up front, but, uh, the price has gone up since you were here the last time. It's gonna be $300 now. Hey, is he just gonna stay here and watch? If you don't want to eat, you can leave. So, what have you been doing all this time? Oh, you know, I've been around, trying other things. I guess that's what life is all about, seeing what's out there. But it's still nice to have something to fall back to, huh? You have no idea how glad I am you came. Did something happen? You were right. Lock me up. Enough, please! She said that's enough. You gonna listen? Enough! www.tvsubtitles.net
