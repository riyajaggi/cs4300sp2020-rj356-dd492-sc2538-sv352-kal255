 Hi removed: Xenzai[NEF] Previously on "Being Human"... You're more pathetic as a ghost than - you were alive. - SHUT UP!! I'm not the kind of guy who mounts women spontaneously and has furious animal sex. I can't believe I went with it myself. I wanna be with you, but there's something in my life. And we have the numbers and we have the power. We won't have to hide.

 We can live right out in the open. Aidan! Rebecca fixed me. I wish I was like this before, then those boys wouldn't have messed with me. Thank you for taking care of those boys. Whatever I can do. Listen to me! He was out of control. You couldn't teach him, like you said to me? The way you live is an insult to the empire they've built. I'll come back. I'm sorry, could you be a little bit more specific? - Come back to... - To you. I'll come back to you. The only constant in life...

 is change. People, as a species, are in a constant state of metamorphosis. Just when we get comfortable swimming in the sea, we end up on land. The moment we become accustom to crawling, we stand on 2 legs. After you. Our instinct is to resist change, to fear it, so we wrap a pretty word like "evolution" around it and hope that it will make the pill... ...easier to swallow. Well... this is one of our better additions to Boston since your last visit. We've reserved the entire space for your enjoyment. What about the harbour? Again, the harbour isn't what it used to be. There's too many people there now, tourists, even at night. But we always go to the harbour. Yes, we like to feed by the water. Yes, well... Maybe next time. They aren't chained. Were they compelled? No, there's no need. The agreement is that we feed, not kill. They're here by choice. Some, because they hope to be diners someday. And... some have issues. But you don't drain them? We do not feed on blood. We feed on life. This is appalling. Well, this is a new reality. We're not asking you to forsake your old ways, but you did say you wanted to see how we lived here in Boston, and this is it. Fenway Park, Faneuil Hall... and Lola. Local treasures all. The thing is, change doesn't care if you love it or you hate it. Change is indifferent, intractable. Like I said, every cubicle is here for your disposal. Or... ...whatever you're into. We will try this city feeding. You won't be disappointed. And it will not be denied. But we will do it our way. # And we surrender # # Stuck in... # So... Aidan's back! Mmm... It's wonderful, isn't it? All of us together again on our last day. Our last day? Mmm... There's a traitor amongst us, boys. Someone has told the Dutch everything. All my plans... well, our plans... have come to naught. Today, we will die. How can you be so sure? Mmm, it's the cycle of this endless life. Aidan remembers well enough how these things play out. So greedy. And they think we're uncivilized. Sync & corrections by Alice www.addic7ed.com Thanks, Jason. Dr. Miller... Hey... there, you. You're annoyed. You're mad. Annoyed and mad, and you should be. I'm so sorry. You vanished, Josh. - For 2 days. - I know. I'm beyond words sorry. I don't know what to say. What happened? You can't tell me. All I can do is say that I'm... sorry... again and just pray that you can forgive me. I'm pregnant, Josh. You're... pregnant? - With... with my baby? - What? - But, I... - Who else would it be? - I don't... - Wow, wow! And just like that, you've turned this into clich?s. The slut who gets herself in trouble, the bastard who ducks his responsibilities. I didn't mean it like that. I... I ju... Can we just start over, please? You know, I've been rehearsing this conversation in my head for 2 days. But it never went like this. I'm just surprised. Well, you know, we shouldn't be. It was stupid of us not to use anything! I just thought that I... What, what? What did you think, Josh? What? That I was on the pill? Or that if something happened, I'd take care of it? - No! No! - I can't do this right now. Nora, just... I just wanted you to know. Now, I'm gonna go back to the version of this conversation that I was having in my head, 'cause it was much better. Nora, don't. Nora... Why are you putting yourself through this? I owed it to Bishop. How could you owe him anything? Isn't ruining your life enough? I don't know. Maybe... Maybe I can make things better... for all of us. My God... You've been here one day and you've got Kool-Aid coming out of your ears. Bishop wants to take over the public so that he doesn't have to hide. But it's his hunger that he really needs to control. If I can teach him that control over the urge... Oh! Sorry. You're serious. Thought you'd appreciate a little hope. After everything we've been through? I'm tired of disappointments, Aidan. I know. That's why I feel like... I owe this to you. To us. Give up on us. There's too much blood under the bridge. And now it's just too late. Hello? Guys? You get my message about the exterminator? Yes, you anal-retentive freak. They're gone. Spray away. Whoo, there's a lot of energy in here. You can feel it right when you walk in. OK... That's not an exterminator. So when did you buy this house? 2007. How many spaces? Rooms? Seven. There's 10 if you include closets. No way! She's a realtor? You're gonna sell our house? My house? And right out from under the guys? You really are a piece of crap. I need to know every space. Look, will this take long? I really can't say. Every place is different. So long as we can move on. Oh, Bridget! Don't move anywhere with him! You can't! He's just trying to get you away from everybody else. That's how it starts. This is where she died. Why does she care where I died? Uh, do you need anything? No. I'm good. So what I like to do is clear the spirits room by room. Clear the spirits? - There's only one spirit. - Of course! Sarah. - Sally. - Oh! Right, Sally. Sally... Well, after today, you won't have to worry about Sally ever again. Why? Do you think we could move this along, the, uh... ritual? The exorcism. Right. The exorcism? Bishop suspects something. What kind of a leader would he be if he didn't? Well, if I'm compromised with him, I wanna be sure our deal is intact. Correct? Was there a deal? Well, an understanding. You handle Bishop, and I take Boston. You know, I find, after a number of decades, that a certain grace settles upon us. I'm sure you'll find the same. I'm not sure that death is necessary. Isn't it more important that we restore order? But you... We all just want what's for the greater good, don't we? Is it Aidan? You wouldn't make him leader, would you? Because with all due respect, that would be insane. He's a heretic, a sham. Please do not presume that you will ever tell me anything that I do not already know. As for the rest, all will be discussed at the meeting. The meeting? Of course. Salt... binds the spirit to the house for the ceremony. This way, they can't escape and sneak back in later. She's bound here until she's gone? Yeah, that's how it works. Pfft! Whatever. Son of a bitch! It's salt? I mean, it's killer on hardwood. Can't we use something else? Well, we have 2 options. You can either follow the ceremony to the word or burn this house to the ground. Out on the street. Out on the street! All right, let's begin. No! Sally? Sally, your friends want you to go now and find the peace that you deserve. What, that's all there is to it? You ask nicely? Because we could've done that. Nicely, right. Ghosts were once people. And people respond to being asked nicely. "Please" and "thank you". I mean, that's always my first course of action. Now... Sally, please, go find your peace. It's time. Ah! Oh! Ah! Well, this... this might require more than "please" and "thank you". It's this city air, filthy. Yeah, secondhand smoke is a killer. How long's it been? 50 years, that we sat right here. Who could forget? You murdered Carlo right over there. Carlo? Oh, yes. Let a heretic run wild in his care, didn't he? Well, if by heretic you mean me, yes, he did. Youthful indiscretion, I think we can all agree. And what would you call, uh, this... experiment of yours? Living with humans. Youthful indiscretion as well? I don't live with humans. Is there something else? It's come to our attention that you've been creating a great number of children. That, furthermore, you have a plan to turn all the right people to bring your family public. Do you deny this? I do not deny it. Our laws pertaining to the number of family members are quite clear. It keeps one clan from becoming stronger than the others. I'm curious about this need of yours to declare yourself to the masses. Would you rather us live in the shadows? In garages and barns for the rest of eternity? So you would have us take over humanity by becoming more human? And after the humans acknowledge our existence, they what? Just... submit? Some will. Some will need to be persuaded. Persuaded? Mass murder, enslavement... Two possibilities. What? We've tried to come into the light. It's never worked, not once in our history. Your plan jeopardizes the existence of us all. And your plan, your theology, denies the existence of us all. We are either the master race or we're cowards. Why can't you and the Council see that? You will cull this clan by two-thirds. You, Bishop, will come back with us. There, you will go under the earth for no less than 50 years. Think about it. Discuss. We will take your answer at tonight's dinner. Take the deal. And in my absence, when Hegeman and his Taliban have run Boston straight back to the Middle Ages, what then? Boston will survive, and so will you. Take the deal. This isn't about survival. It's what we've always talked about building. You and I, this is our dream. We never talked about this. If you reject the Dutch, then every family in the Council will be after your head. Nora... You... you had the... Oh my God! I told them to get you. - Nobody called? - No. Is it... Is he healthy? I can't get the little bugger to latch on just yet, but he's perfect. Daddy's here. No! No, no, no! No! Ah! God, our Father, cleanse this place of the dark remnant dwelling within and fill it with light and love. Be gone unclean spirit. Leave this world for those who still live in it. God, our Father... cleanse this place of the dark, dark remnant. Fill it with light. Why are you doing this? I left you alone! You won! God, our Father... remove all power from this lost spirit. Power of this lost spirit. Lost spirit. Lost, lost... Leave this world for those who still live in it. Dr. Johnson, pick up Line 1, please. Aidan! Hey! You're here. Yeah, I've gotta keep up appearances. Right, yeah. I mean, you still work here, all right? It's there you have to keep up appearances. That's, like, a show. Like a one night only kind of thing, right? Right? So... So how is, uh... How is everything over there with... with them? Everything's everything. It's everything, sure. So, are you coming back to the house or... I don't know. Will you know? Josh, I don't know! OK. You all right? I'm just concerned about you, really. And, no, I'm not all right. Nora's pregnant. Wait, with your... I think so. Yeah, and I'm sure you already know this. But, you know, that question, like, the worst thing that you can ask a woman when she announces. Wait, you didn't ask that did you? - I... - Oh! I didn't think a guy like me could have a kid. Yeah, me neither! Josh... Whoa! Uh-huh. Wow! Yeah. Right? So what do you think? Congratulations. Congratulations? No, thank you. No, I'm not looking for a cigar, man. I need help, OK? I... I need... What do I do? Josh, I realize that you're freaking out. But listen, this is good. Hell, this is better than good. This is normal. It doesn't feel normal, OK? If it were normal, I'd be running around telling friends, family, people in line at Starbucks, not pacing the hall trying to figure out how to tactfully bring up an abortion. Wait a second. You didn't actually have that conversation, did you? No! I didn't think it'd be a very good follow-up to "Are you sure that's my kid?" But it just feels wrong. I mean, what if it's like me? What if it's... What if it's just like me? I don't know. But before you talk about doing anything drastic, think about this... You and me... We agreed to make a go at having a real life. - Yeah. - Right? I know we did. Looks like one of us is gonna get a shot. Isn't this always the way? They roll out the red carpet and sweep us right under it. I thought you'd firmly secured your place amongst the Chosen. There is no security. You should know that. Not when you're a mistake, like you and I. Excuse my honesty. I, uh... I'm in a mood. Because Aidan's back? How is the world's most loyal bootlicker possibly a mistake? Well, they were coming for my brother. Bishop and his men, riding high from the slaughter in Concord, drunk on blood and thirsty for more. I came outside when I heard them in the barn. They were already on him. That's... awful. I hated my brother. He put up fight, and Bishop liked that. Yeah, Silas was a soldier. I'd avoided the war and stayed home to pursue my studies. So how did they get you? Well, Silas wanted to die with honour, not as a monster, so... he took his dagger and slit his own throat. But Bishop wouldn't go home empty-handed. That left him with me. I would do. Soon after that, he got Aidan, the good little soldier he'd been looking for. So you see... we're just pawns, you and I. Who do you think killed Bernie's little bullies? So it was your fault, what happened to Bernie? We've just been put here as stepping stones to get him back what he really wanted. Aidan. Pathetic, if you ask me. He's a coward and a traitor. Aren't you betraying Bishop right now, talking this way? We should help each other, you and I. Don't you see that we're closer than you knew. Give me space, Marcus. I'm in a mood. This is it. Are you two ready? Yeah. I don't know. It feels like it's working. Doesn't it feel like it's working? It does, yeah. Bridget, please... - God, our Father... - Stop. Wait. What are you doing? What will happen to her? Will she go to Heaven? Honestly, I don't know, honey. You don't know? We only have the ability to get the energy out of a space. Where they go or what they become, it's unknown to me. - I don't know about this. - Seriously? This whole deal was your idea. What if she's clinging to this house, to us, for a reason? This isn't her house anymore! She's safe here. What if we send her somewhere bad? Send her somewhere bad? We're the ones in Hell! I mean, every conversation we have turns to Sally. Whenever the wind blows, you think Sally's whispering something to you. I mean, every night, you think she's watching us sleep. I just think maybe Sally deserves more. We deserve more. Don't we? You have to finish this. God, our Father... cleanse this place of the dark spirit dwelling within and fill it with light and love. Well, gentlemen... I hope you brought your appetites. Did I mention here that Michelle is pregnant with twins? Don't be shy. Dig in! She's been compelled so we can enjoy our little delicacy in peace. It's your decision, Bishop. Is this meal a celebration of your good judgement or a memorial to your stupidity? My decision... Yes. Well... business before pleasure, I assume. I'd like to make a toast. Wait! Nobody wants a war. Not against humanity, not amongst the families. If Bishop would revise his ambitions, if he would scale them back, then you could truthfully report to the Council that he submitted to your demands while leaving a flawed, but capable leader here in Boston. And if that's not enough, then you can take me. I'm the true heretic. If I were to submit to punishment... that might be enough. And since Aidan is so selflessly willing to submit, maybe Bishop would agree to some sort of power share. Something to make the Council feel more at ease. Well, gentlemen... I do believe you've just heard the clarion call of surrender, which is kind of funny. Because I was going to stand up here and tell you that I reject your offer. I reject your theology. I reject your cowardice. And I was prepared to stand up here and fight you for what was right. But I cannot do that alone. And now it seems I stand here more alone than ever. My sons... in their own way, have rejected me... lost faith in me, deserted me. Well... These things happen, and so, a new toast. Mmm, forgive my heedlessness. I accept your terms. I surrender. My family will be reduced. Boston is yours. Let's celebrate. Mmm... What's the matter? Did you guys eat already? Come on! Celebrate! I rolled over, tail between my legs, etc., etc. You don't look so good, old friend. Oh! You know what I bet it was? Lola. Yeah. That pretty little thing from the blood den. I probably should've told you she was on a steady diet of juniper. Yeah, as a matter of fact, all the donors have been noshing on the stuff. Nasty stuff, that juniper. Really slow-acting, but once it kicks in, it really packs a wallop. Everything in the body constricts and stiffens. They say it's a lot like rigor mortis. The effects don't last too long, but I only need a couple of minutes to enjoy this. Help. Oh, they're not gonna help you. Those two? Useless, trust me. Bishop, think about this. If you only drank a little from the donors, you'd be fine. But no, you had to follow the old ways and suck them dry. Hey, I'm not judging. I understand where you're coming from. Traditions work. And as the saying goes... "If it ain't broke, don't fix it". But there is another saying... "Change or die". Bishop! Did you really think I didn't have a plan? You may be older, but you don't have the market cornered on wisdom. # You saw in me and my hands # # Things you were missing # # I become # # Dead in December... # Marcus don't be a fool. By killing Hegeman and the idiot who tried to help him escape? Bishop will be so pleased. Marcus you could come with us. Yeah, because we're so close, you and I. - Don't worry. - Oh! I'll tell your friends you died screaming like a pig. # I'm # # High in the summer # Let's go! Let's go! # I become # # Dead in December # This was our bedroom. We were half-joking, but we always said this was where we'd make our family. No. She wanted that more than anything in the world. Now I can never give her that. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. You have to finish this. I can't take much more. You don't get to talk about me like that. You don't get to mourn me! Be gone unclean spirit. Leave this world for those who still...... NO! It was too crappy for you. You know I love that ring. Then where the hell is it! I told you, it fell! Oh! Oh! What happened? - Is it done? Is she gone? - Alannah? Are you OK? Alannah? You! You did this to me. No, Sally, no. I didn't mean to. How could you do this to me? It was an accident, you crazy bitch! - I HATE YOU! - Why won't you just die? Danny, stop it! I'm gonna fix it right now! Ah! Oh God, are you OK? Alannah? You! I know what you are. Wait! You have to finish the job. We already paid. Here, here, here! Here's your stupid money! What about Sally? What happened to her? I don't know, but I hope she's still here. She deserves this place. And you... You deserve whatever she does to you. No, no, Sally's a liar. She just can't stand for us to be happy. No. The dead don't lie. No, Bridget, don't do this. Get out of my way. You can't just leave me like this! I won't tell anyone. They won't even believe me. What? You think I'd do something to you? You know that's not who I am. Please, let me go. Let me go! I'm sorry, Sally. So, I want to apologize again. You ever say or hear something so many times that the words lose all meaning? Can we talk? I'm, like, begging. Hurry up. I've got tons of guys to sleep with. That's not what I meant when I said that. Really? What could you have meant? I didn't think I could get anyone pregnant. I've got... I have problems, like, deep genetic-level problems. And I didn't think I could. That's what that meant. And it's not just me. My whole... family's screwed up, so... That's your big confession? God, Josh, whose family isn't? Yeah, I know, but really... I swore that I would never have children. My God, my family... Things aren't right. Addiction, mental illness, violence... I'm always so careful with protection. I'm paranoid, actually. But that night with you... I don't know. There was something about it. Something different. And it wasn't just that you jumped me and it was over in 20 seconds. Yeah, I think it was at least 30. I can't blame you for being freaked. I'm not sure I have it in me either. I just want you to know that I'm not... going anywhere. Well, we don't have to decide right now though, right? It's still early. Totally. I'm glad you don't think I'm a slut. I'm all right. All right, let go. Let go. Are you sure? I'm healing already, yeah. I have to get back. You tell them what you saw here. Oh! He needs to be stopped. Listen to me. Prepare. Prepare for what's coming. You think he'll make it back? Maybe. Probably. You had pretty impeccable timing back there. He had it coming. You know Marcus was responsible for the bullies? I don't know why I didn't assume that in the first place. You need to be careful. Whatever Bishop's thinking, it's obviously well planned. Why would you offer to go underground? It's because everything I've done here has been a mistake. I don't think I was so bad. Of course you weren't. None of this has ever been your fault. I know. It's all been out of my control... until now. No, no. Rebecca, no. I'm not meant to be like this. Like you and Bishop. That night when you were with me... I was supposed to die. I am dead. It's not right that I'm here. I can't do this to you. Aidan... I swear that I will do it myself. Rebecca, we're gonna get out of here. You have to let me go. I killed Marcus. But I'm not gonna let them win. At least give me the dignity to do this myself, before they can. You always said you didn't want this for me. I didn't. So... if you loved me even for a second of this horrible ride... Hi removed: Xenzai[NEF] you would let me go. OK, well, then I'm going with you. No, no. You have to finish this. # She waltzes on the city # # The rooftops and raindrops # # Wet and all spent # # And I thought I had you... # Please. # Where I don't want you # # When you arrived # # I knew you'd be next... # OK.
