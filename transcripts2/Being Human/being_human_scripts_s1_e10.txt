 Previously on "Being Human"... We have too much to do in too little time to lay waste to the one strength we have. That goes for the weakest... that goes for the mistakes. Is it totally crazy town to pursue a relationship with someone when you're both dead? None of us should be in relationships. - Oh my God! - No! (Screaming) Ah!

 Aidan! Rebecca fixed me! You can't turn a kid! I did this for you. That is why we don't turn children. I have news from Boston. May I see them? (Bishop): Immortality is an easy thing to take for granted. You figure: You've got forever. What's a little mistake here and there? But that's the thing about forever. The choices you make, the people you lose, your mistakes are indelible,

 with no sweet death to erase your own memory. (Garage door opening) (? Man singing folk rock ?) You may think the greatest reward of eternal life is the power it gives you. You're untouchable. Whatever's going on with you, stow it! I'm fine. You're brooding over your girl when we have business to attend to. And the Dutch will smell every inch of her human stink all over you. (Laughing) Will you give me a hand, please? What do you want me to say? It's a relationship. It's complicated. It's ridiculous. You know what? I don't expect you to understand. What? That you completely lost your mind? Excuse me for not understanding! You think they'll understand, huh? Being shunned for a human? You think they'll care? Bishop, we don't even know why they're here, and you wanna step out! What? To go courting? Now? She's pulling away from me, Aidan. I can feel it. So? So... You know what? Just go. Carlo, I gotta go. Where? Better you go now before they wake up. (Door opening) The power is a perk, something to make your endless passing days more bearable. But to rule the world alone... is worthless. Sync & corrections by Alice www.addic7ed.com (Rebecca screaming) Listen to me! Listen! He was out of control! It is impossible for a child that young to control what this is! So you couldn't teach him like you said you'd teach me? I believed you! - I know! - Bernie believed you! I know! I hate myself! Enough for both of us. Listen to me. Bernie... (Breathing heavily) But when you've been alive for as long as I have, you begin to understand or see. He was the closest thing I'll ever have to a son. The closest thing... I'll ever have to sharing my blood. I'm sorry. (Exhales) Your son... Were you there when he died, like you were with Bernie? Don't ever talk about my son! Hey! Take your situation elsewhere. They'll be awake soon. Who? Hegeman and the others. Um, the... The Dutch are here? Who the hell are the Dutch? Listen. Shh! The Dutch, they are our elders. They originate from the Netherlands. They hide in Amish country because it's the closest thing to an orthodox lifestyle that they can find. Hey, you need to be careful! The Dutch are intense. It doesn't matter how many there are. Even if there's a few, a whisper from them sends a trigger to Pennsylvania, to the families in Chicago and New York. I don't need protection! Especially from you! Yes, well, shall we? I'm not staying here! Look, Bishop, I'm not a member of this family anymore. I don't have to put on a show for them. Hmm. I see. You're sure you don't wanna stay? Tell Hegeman in person how you suck on hospital bags and live with a werewolf? 'Cause he just loves to hear updates on modern customs. He doesn't need to know... Hegeman doesn't care about me. Oh, on the contrary, my friend. You're the great warrior. I understand your wish to be free of us, but I'm good that way. Hegeman is 1010. He's old-fashioned. To him, the way you live is an insult to the empire they've built. Are you husking corn for your lady? I love it! Are you also making pie? Because you should. Oh wow! Are you trying to look like a douche? I'm trying not to look like a crazy person talking to myself. Oh, smart! So, what time are you going over to Nora's? Half hour. I figure a daytime barbeque should be safe. Oh... right, right. Full moon tonight. How are you pulling this off? I'm barely pulling it off. She just gets that some things are private. You know? I feel almost like a person when I'm with her. Yeah. Must be nice. I'm sorry things didn't work out with Nick. Ah... I'm not sad about Nick per se. Would've gotten messy. Soggy. But at least, for a little while there, I felt solid... like I had a semi-real life. I was a part of something. You're a part of something here. - I'm not. - You are. You guys go off and live your crazy monster lives, and I barely have any idea what's going on. And sometimes what's going on is dark and awful and I can't do anything to help you. You do things! Hey, you remember that time that you totally freaked Nora out? Unintentionally! I want intention! I want impact! I want corn! It just gets stuck in your teeth. All right. I'll be right back. (Car door slams, tires screech) Josh? Josh? (Sighs) I feel silly eating alone. Can't you at least pretend to want a sandwich? I'm sorry, I don't mean to stare. I just love looking at you. I suppose it must be nice to be the way you are, not to want anything. That's not true. I need you. Give me a kiss. (Giggles) Mm-mmm. What? What's the matter? - It's my birthday next week. - I know. We're going to Vermont! (Siren in distance) I just keep getting older. We talked about this, dear. It doesn't have to be this way. I can change that. - I don't want you to. - I want... - I can't do that. - I want this to last forever. It's not natural. We'd be cheating God. My shift is starting. We'll talk later. (Whistles) Hope she's worth it. Just turn her. Then you can be together forever in a normal relationship, not this... whatever this is. Did I mention she's human? You don't think I've tried to convince her? She doesn't want it. Then you need to move on. Carrying on with a human you can't turn spits in the face of our people. One day you'll understand, Aidan. I respect her. I... I respect her humanity. Well... (Exhales) I've been sent for you. Carlo wants us to entertain them. Think about what this looks like, man, to Hegeman, to the rest of them. What? They're not gonna miss me. It's Carlo they're sniffing around. Oh, so you abandon him? Huh? Now? God! Your family needs you now. (Sighs) (Church bells clanging) Just do it. She'll thank you in the end. (Cell ringing) ? Hey, sexy ? ? Hey, hey, hey, sexy ?. Hegeman. Drink. (Clears throat) The last 50 years have been kind to you, old friend. Obviously, the rural life is treating you well. (Grunts) (Exhales) Ugh... They can be a little brutish. (Josh grunting) (Breathing heavily) What the hell is this? My name is Douglas. What's your name? No... No! No! No! You... You tell me what's going on here! You tell me what's going on here! I was home. I was doing things. And then... No, you tell me what this is! Tell me what this is! You're a werewolf, son. For them, this is sport. Vampires? Of course. They call me the Professor. Well, that's nice. You've been down here for a while. You've got yourself a little nickname. Who's... Would you let me out of here? Let me out! It doesn't matter. We're in the bowels of their little empire. They're faster, stronger... until tonight, that is. Tonight, you turn. Yes, I know. And I would like to not do it down here with you, sir. That's why they've brought you here. It's a dogfight, son. The moon gets high, they watch you turn. They drool over your tortures. They bet money on who will rip who to shreds. You're serious? The winner keeps fighting, trapped the other 29 days of the month. And the loser? The loser dies. So, where's the other guy? They keep him locked in an isolation room with a piece of raw meat or something? For the last 15 years, they've kept me here. You painted. Uh, yes. Um, eight? Ten. Ten. Ten years ago. Yes. It... Our clients find it more soothing. And you find your clients soothing, as well. It's a business. It funds what we need. To comingle with humans? To pretend you care about their dearly departed's death? I would have hoped you'd done away with this little charade. And live on a farm? Be what you are. Brother, it was decided long ago, different strokes for different sects. What's he have to say about it? Stolzfus, Hegeman. It's been a long time. I remember you. (Marcus): So... Gentlemen, in the absence of any set agenda, we've taken the liberty of providing some entertainment this evening. Wolves. (Exhales) - And then tomorrow... - Will be tomorrow. Of course. Well, shall we? Take off your clothes. No. Take off your clothes. (Sniffing) Bend over. What? Bend over. I think we have a winner. This all happened very spur of the moment. And... who knows? Maybe he'll win. ? I've got the blues ? ? I've got the blues ? ? I ain't got nothing but the blues... ?. We missed you yesterday, Bishop. Yes, my apologies. It was... personal matters. Though, it's hard to complain, given the time this one showed us. I apologize. There's a viewing going on. Who died? A Jew. Sad. Now... we understand you have news from Pennsylvania. Yes. (Blood spurting) ? I've got the blues ? (Laughing) ? I ain't got nothing but the blues ? ? I ain't got nothing but the blues ?. What did he do? He was your maker, wasn't he? Yes. Yet you didn't rise up to defend him... even after he let you carry out your... heresy under his roof. Maybe because even you... with all your indiscretions... even you realized that such sacrilege cannot go unpunished... cannot be allowed to proliferate. You've fallen, Bishop. Let us help you up... brother to brother. There's nothing you can do for me. I can give you Boston. It was always meant to be yours... before all this. I don't know what to say. Give up the girl... Boston is yours. No. You knew one of them. The vampire, you knew him. I... did. Well... that must complicate things for you. I'm sure there's a good reason. For his inaction? The company he keeps... they're savage, heartless. But you know that. We're strong. We're strong now. We're strong now. We can get out of this. We can jump the guards, get outside. I mean, this is a funeral parlour, right? It's not freaking Alcatraz! Sure. We could do all of that. Maybe get outside when the moon's at its fullest, run into a mother of three, who we proceed to rip apart. That's why they don't even lock you up. 'Cause they've got you brainwashed into thinking you're as monstrous as they are! They don't lock me up... because they know I would no longer try to escape. Out there, I could hurt someone. You'll see. You live out there long enough, you turn someone. Not if you're careful. I always thought I was. It's safer here. Here it's contained. What are you doing with all those notes? Probably nothing. (Sighs) I have a notebook, too. I was going to med school... before. I thought I could start to isolate the transformation, learn to stop it. (Inhales) And? Aidan, thank God! Josh is... - I know. - You know he's gone? How do you know that? Why aren't they here? Where are you coming from? I've been looking for you. I went to the hospital! Aidan, he just vanished! I think you need to call the police! No police! - What are you looking for? - Keys. Hey, I'm in this, too. Talk to me, keys to what? Sapp & Sons. Little funeral home on Kent Street? Why? - Josh is there. - You know where he is? And you have keys? I had them a long time ago. I can't involve you in this. Aidan, I haven't been able to do anything! Someone somewhere down the line has gotta let me try! Ah, they're not here! We need a plan! I'll have one! They let me study them afterwards for physical traits, reactions, that sort of thing. (Whooshing) (Sally): Josh! Hey! There are vampires here. A lot! And they are not respectful of ghosts. I just popped in upstairs, and they tried to dissipate me with a fire iron. Not pleasant! We need to get you out of here! Sally, this is Douglas. OK... Hi. I'm in the right place, right? Somewhere scary that you do not wanna be? Yes. Yeah, yeah. But it's... It's useless. Aidan has a plan. Yeah... I saw Aidan and his buddies. I'm pretty sure he doesn't have a plan. In fact, I'm certain that we don't remotely know what dark insanity he's wrapped up in. No, he's trying to be good! I wanna believe that, too. I do. But... I just keep thinking, if he was gonna do something, why hasn't he done it yet? And he's a werewolf, too. They're gonna make us fight each other. - What? - Yes! That's the level of shock I was looking for. OK, we need to psyche you up so you do really, really well. Yeah, Josh, he's old. You can take him! Yeah, he's old. He's stronger. They've been keeping him down here for 15 years, Sally. This fight is all he does! And there's no "doing well." There's winning or there's dying. I have to kill a man. That's not who I am. I can't do that. I think you have to. (Exhales) I can't fix what's happened between us, but for a second, please, I need you to put that aside. You hate them as much as I do. But Marcus, he likes you. He could be swayed by you. He wouldn't savagely murder my progeny. Is that what you mean? He has the keys to this place, and I am sure that he would give them to you. Keys, Aidan? That's your big plan? I could unlock the cage. I could figure out... You can't bend the bars? I don't know! Maybe! I'm not Superman. And you don't drink live. Why don't you ask Bishop extra super sweetly? Because this whole thing is being staged for the Dutch. Bishop would never cross them. And I would be slaughtered even before I got anywhere near Josh's door. Well, then it looks like you're running out of options, aren't you? Josh is the only family I've got. It didn't have to be that way. This is not the way to take your revenge on me. Oh... (Whooshing) What is that? Sally! No, you can't be here! It's you, from the video. Oh, you shared! Oh, that's nice. I don't know what the deal is between you two and I don't really care... No, I do care because you've obviously scrambled his brains! Why aren't you doing something? Oh, sweetie... no one's gonna stop the crazy train in this place. I suggest that you walk towards something white and pretty and just stay out of it. I'm not gonna let this happen to Josh. Good luck with that. If it makes you feel any better, I understand how you feel. Really, I do. Aidan... you choose these monsters over us? I am one of them! This goes back further than you could know. And there is a way that I have to handle this! By not doing anything? Yeah, you had your centuries of badness. I get that! But you committed to a new kind of life with us, with Josh, at least, who's actually living, who actually matters! - OK... - Look... I obviously don't know you. So you tell me, have you ever in your endless life cared enough about anything to actually take a stand? ? Pretty baby, ooh wee... ?. What is this, Aidan? It's a desk in a funeral-home garage. It's life in the shadow. No, no, no, this is our reality. This is what we have been working for. All you had to do was say yes! No, you don't understand. I don't understand? (Laughing) I don't understand? OK. Uh... I had a family. You took it from me. You took my life from me and then convinced me that we were gonna build something else, something made... Something that would celebrate our immortality! And you are squandering it! God, you are such a hypocrite! I used to honour you! I used to fear you! And now I can barely recognize what you are anymore! I can't lose her, Aidan. I'm sorry. I can't lose her. (Breathing heavily) (Crying) Well, then you've lost me. I can't trust you with my life the way that I once did. And if you don't get rid of her... I can't support you. And they... They will kill you. And I'm not gonna stay around to suffer your consequences and tidy up your mess. Not anymore. I'm done! Aidan... I'm not gonna heed you. I won't succumb to you, not ever again. I renounce you as my maker. You would turn your back on me? Oh... Smarten up, pal. Because either I leave you now... or I betray you later. Tell me that you understand. ? ? ? I need you to let Josh go. I'm afraid it's a bit too late for that. I'll come back. With the understanding that if I do, Josh walks out of here a free man. Could you be a bit more specific? Come back... To you. I'll come back to you. (Crowd cheering) Not long now, pup. Come here, boy. Come here! (Sally): Don't let the bastard scare you, Josh. (Exhales) Get undressed. (Cheering) Yeah! Yeah! Come on! Come on! Whoo! Come on! Bishop... (Josh screaming) (Breathing heavily) (Screaming) Marcus! (Josh screaming) (Continues screaming) I'm afraid I have some bad news, gentlemen. The older wolf is sick. It wouldn't be a fair fight, at least not fair for all those who have laid down money. (Grunting) Ahh! I know how much you appreciate a good wolf fight and I don't wanna disappoint you, so we'll just watch this one transform, and that should salvage the evening somewhat, no? Or you could volunteer some of yours to fight him. (Josh growling) Well, Hegeman, that would be suicide. And I'm afraid I can't afford to lose any of my people. But you have so many. So many. (Growling intensifies) (Growling) I'm afraid there was a bit of a problem. (Growling) Stop it! You told me you would stop it! Go ahead. (Growling) Go for the neck! Come on! Look at your little friend, the cowardly lion. Come on! (Whimpering) I don't know how to live with myself. It stays with you. The first time I... I couldn't even blink without seeing that man's face. Why didn't they lock me up like Douglas? What did you do? Something that was gonna catch up with me anyway. What the hell does that mean? I have to go back to them. At least for a little while. You'd go back there? Bishop, he did me a favour, and I have to do this for him. Oh... It's a code of honour between us. Where exactly is the honour in that? With them? You should know, Sally, that what you said... it mattered. I was scared, selfish even. It's really you who saved Josh. And doomed you? Aidan, no. Sally's right. What I saw in there... How could you... do that? How could you go back to that? When all this, this house... It was all your idea in the first place! I mean... God, Aidan... what are we supposed to believe in if we can't believe in you? You can. I just hope that you both can forgive me. (Door closing) Ah! How did you get in here? People have a hard time saying no to me. Mmm! Except for you. James, I thought we agreed not to talk about that anymore. And we won't. We won't have to. Are you all right? Everything's OK, Jane. Everything is just grand. That's why I'm here. Is it? I love how vibrant you are, how alive... But lately, I've been thinking... It's not natural. Don't you agree, Jane? Yes, of course. It's not natural at all. You see, because... if you're here... then I'm reminded of my weakness. And you're a temptation to me. And I have to be stronger than that, the way I used to be. Do you have any idea who I used to be? (Choking) My love... That's right... That's right... (Choking) We built something wonderful, you and I, Jane, but I'm afraid this is where it has to end. You said so yourself. And you were right. You were just being true to yourself. It's the same for me. ? And I felt my love's presence ? ? Though she's ? ? Far away ? ? Just a teardrop ? ? From heaven ? ? On a sunny day ? ? A teardrop from heaven ? ? Has shown me the way ? ? Maybe I've sinned ? (Sirens blaring) It goes down. But I'll be right back. Glad you could make it! Let's just get this over with. They've lingered long enough. Right. Would you like to be the one to tell them to leave? (Scoffs) Then let's just get through this. We'll embrace them like the genial hosts we are, let them sniff around Boston's battlegrounds and whatnot. They'll say what they have to say, then they'll leave. They don't even like this city. They're only here to judge us. And we judge them and their provincial farm life smelling of barn owls. To each his own, Aidan. It's worth another 50 years of peace. Fine. Gentlemen! Shall we get some dinner? (Girls laughing) What are they doing here? I think we both know the answer to that. Tomorrow they're gonna kill me. It's good to have you back, Aidan.
