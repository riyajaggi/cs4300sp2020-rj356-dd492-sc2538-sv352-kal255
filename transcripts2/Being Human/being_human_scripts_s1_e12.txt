 Previously on "Being Human"... I'm pregnant, Josh. Be gone, unclean spirit. Exorcism? NO! You, I know what you are. You deserve whatever she does to you. Someone has told the Dutch everything. Your plan jeopardizes the existence of us all. - Change or die. - Bishop! Bishop will be so pleased.

 I was supposed to die. You have to finish this. Prepare for what's coming. Right before a big storm, I used to go with my dad to the harbour... to look at the clouds... feel the air. There's an eerie stillness before the sky cracks open... a hush. You can feel the storm gathering... smell the flood on its way. Oh! You know, I feel really awkward walking around with a bunch of stakes under my jacket.

 You'll feel a lot less awkward when some vampire's ripping into your face. Yesterday, one fell out, and I had to explain to a roomful of nurses that I was whittling. That I'd taken up whittling! Oh! Hey! Can we get you... anything? She looks like The Grudge. - She looks a little rough. - Rough? If we videotaped Sally right now and showed somebody, they'd be dead in 3 days. She was almost exorcized, she's weak. She looks like she's gonna eat our entrails. It has only been a few days. She needs time to heal. She'll be back. As what? Don't leave me alo... So we're... we're gonna, uh... We're gonna go to work. And so you just, uh... Just have a really nice day. OK? Have, like, a "me" day. And then maybe... maybe some skin cream. Uh... Look, I'm... I'm sorry about Rebecca, OK? I know you're messed up right now. But if the Dutch are really as badass as you say they are, don't you think that Bishop has hightailed it? He'd just go underground. He hasn't left Boston. How do you know that? I mean, maybe he's gone back to Romania or Slovenia or Not-Scary Farm. Boston is Bishop's. He spent decades ensuring that. He's not going anywhere. Maybe he's rebuilding. Maybe he's meeting with architects and interior designers and he's building a new green vampire lair. Maybe he doesn't care about you at all. I openly defied him, Josh. Hegeman, Marcus... Rebecca. If he is rebuilding, he can't do a single thing if he keeps me around. No vampire would follow him if he lets me live. Let's do an ego assessment. Maybe we're thinking of ourselves too highly. Listen, if... if Bishop really does wanna kill you, why are we at work and not at home where he can't cross the threshold? That's a brilliant idea. We'll just stay in the whole time. Grey Gardens for the supernatural. Don't worry. Whatever he has to throw at me, I'm ready. Aidan! What are you doing? Stop, stop, stop! Aidan, stop! Stop it right now! Let him go. I'm sorry, sir. I'm taking him back to the psyche ward right now. You do that! When you know you're gonna die a violent death, when that's the only way you can die... it's all about the waiting for that final storm... if the waiting doesn't kill you first. Sync & corrections by Alice www.addic7ed.com Wait, you're telling me that the handyman wasn't in fact a vampire hit man? Shhh! You had me worried for a sec. You're not crazy. You're just a paranoid freak! The only way you stand a chance against a being who is stronger and faster than you and who loves to kill, is to assume that everyone you meet is one of them. Don't tell me you're gonna stake the cougar now. Go on ahead. ♪ The first thing they tell you ♪ ♪ Is to breathe... ♪. Oh... Is it your blood that makes you heal so fast? The tattoo guy was wigged out too. ♪ She's a picture you drew... ♪. Will it stay? Forever... literally. You're insane.

You'll stop. I know you'll stop. I got super lightheaded and chucked it in trauma. Yeah, I think I may have mopped that up. People are gonna start to think I'm pregnant, which I am. Look, I think I'm even starting to show, which I can't be. Whoa! You should say you don't see anything. Are you supposed to get sick this early? Oh, I don't know! I've never been pregnant before. Look, I can deal with this pregnancy, but I can't deal with you melting down and this pregnancy. If you want out, you gotta tell me now. I... This is the time. I'm here. OK? So... you're keeping it? I don't... don't know what I wanna do. I'm not getting an abortion today, that much I know. No, that's good, 'cause I'm... I'm working this afternoon. And my, um, my HCG levels are elevated. To be accurate, they're off the charts. What does... What does that mean? It could indicate multiple fetuses or a birth defect. I scheduled an ultrasound for this afternoon. So hopefully, you can make it. There are more tests. We'll figure out what it is. Ow... Bitch! Still using that pretentious old-school razor, Danny? So dangerous. What if you cut yourself? Ah! That's what it feels like... to die. Groovy. This can't be happening. I have spent the last 2 hours trying to figure out a way to, uh, show myself without giving you a heart attack. Although, this is an awesome place to be if you do have one. For a moment, I thought you were a ghost. Maybe a deathbed visitation. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, you're not... Sorry. I should have found a more politic way to say it. Dying has made me very blunt. What's wrong? It's otherworldly. You're exactly the same... minus the tragic sideburns. Uh, OK, are you gonna tell me what's wrong, or do I have to abuse my considerable lack of authority and steal your file? I had lung cancer years ago. And I guess it couldn't live without me. It's back. All over. Well, who's your doctor? Dr. Corjo? Because he's the best. I'm not here for treatment, just morphine. No more chemo, radiation. I don't wanna eke out another 6 or 9 months retching and sleeping. Mm-mmm. Whatever's left, I wanna live it. I haven't even told my daughter yet. She thinks I'm getting treated here. - Your daughter? - Yeah. That's why I'm in Boston. She lives here. Wha... Congratulations. Um, I'm so happy for you. You know what I mean. Mm-hmm. And what about you? Who's the new girl? And don't tell me there isn't one. It's over. Even your voice. You still sound like you're 25. You could be one of my daughter's boyfriends. Which makes me the matronly mom. This is criminal. I used to be younger than you. You're still beautiful. Take this. Protect yourself. No, no, it's OK. - I don't wanna hurt you. - You won't. So, Boston. This is the last place where I thought you'd be. Put your hand there. Are you OK? Yeah. I'm gonna get that. All right. OK. Ah... There you are. What are you doing here? It's funny. I was gonna ask you the same thing. Aidan, who's there? Oh, are you thirsty? I'm thirsty. It's been a grueling trip. I don't suppose you'll, uh, have her invite me in? Oh, you're not setting foot in here. You had no right to track me down. What was I supposed to do? You're taking a vacation, you said. You need a little time to yourself. Next thing I know, 5 years go by, and you're nowhere to be found on the Eastern Seaboard. And? You don't control me anymore. I'm free, remember? Come on, Aidan. What are you doing? Montreal? Her? Come on, I promised that we were gonna build something bigger than us. Come home and let's build it. I'm not coming back. Celine, is it? - Well, that's my business. - Like Jane was my business? Look, that was 20 years ago. And I remember it like it was yesterday. You're walking on a thread, aren't you? You're trying as hard as you can not to bite a chunk out of her, drain her dry while she's lying there next to you in bed? Hey, I tried that for years with Jane, and it feels like your insides are being stripped into meat. And for what? To wake up one morning in a bed full of blood? Your concern is touching, really. Oh, you think you can control yourself? OK. I'm all for freewill, man. This is America. This is still the land of opportunity. But it's your nature, man. That still, quiet voice inside you that wants what it wants. Come on, it's time. Come home. I could have decapitated him. You're back! Oh my God! This is great. No more zombie Sally. I think it was slitting Danny's throat open that did it. Brought me back. What? You saw how weak I was. After the exorcism, I thought I was gonna blow away. And then I saw him... shaving. He was so smug. And I wanted to kill him. If I had just cut a little deeper, if I had a little more control... Whoa! Hey. You sound like you're interning for Hannibal Lecter. You think this is a joke? I'm finally figuring this out. I cut Danny open and then I was back, 100%. It felt so good. One shove while he's waiting for the T. One swipe on the wheel while he's driving. No! Why is everyone so kill-happy? We gotta leave Montreal as soon as possible, today. Is this you trying to keep the romance alive? The guy at the door, that was Bishop. What? Celine, come on! Get ready now! What about my family? It's better if they don't know, for them. Or what? You mean Bishop would kill them? I'm gonna take care of you, I promise. No, no, no! I don't wanna be taken care of! Just turn me! Then Bishop can't hurt me. And you won't have to be so careful. I don't want that life for you. You want me to throw away my life and follow you God knows where! And for how long? Until you turn me in for the younger model. You don't think a part of me wants to turn you? Listen, it takes everything I have not to feed and kill. There are days where all I can think about is blood. I don't want you to have to fight that or give into it, because you would. You would hate me if I turned you. You'd hate yourself. No, I only get one life. You get dozens, hundreds! And you want me to give the best part to you. I can't spend my life running away from him. I deserve better than that. I need some time to think. Yeah, you know what? Take your time. Cool off. I gotta go get some things, but I am coming back for you. At 7:00, you can yell at me on the train. But whatever you do, don't leave the apartment. Don't tell me what to do. Celine, I'm just telling you what you need to do to be safe. He can't... Please, wait for me. I don't know. I don't know anymore. Celine, I am coming back. I'm coming back. Please... ♪ I have never felt ♪ ♪ What I feel for you ♪ ♪ But I feel as though I know you ♪. Hey... So it's official. Nora's gonna have a litter of were-babies. You have to stop this. No, there's medical confirmation now, man. I mean, her... her hormone levels are all whacked out. I'm gonna have to tell her what I am and convince her not to have... Werewolves are made, not born. Are you delusional? I mean, do you personally know any werewolves who've procreated? Whose offspring you've... you've examined and know not to be m-monsters or deformed? Are you happy with her? Yes. Yes, which is why I wanna kill myself, because I've ruined her life! Well, then you need to hold onto that, the good part, what you and Nora have. The rest you can work out when it comes. Oh, and Sally's, like, full-on murder ghost now. - Hey, Jenny. - Hey. It... it's OK. - Josh! - Oh my God! Josh! What do I do? What do I do? Stake her in the heart. Hey, guys, it's Danny. I'm out of town for a few days. What, did I scare you? Good. You've got my cell. Now you know how it feels, you sick, murdering, piece of... Guys? Guys? I'm right here, killer. And guess what... I'm better than ever. Sally? She told me how to get rid of you. The medium. You tried to kill me? Show your face! I wanna see you scream. All right. Whoa, what are you doing? You can't haunt our house if there is no house. You're gonna burn down our house? Seriously? Danny! Come on, get out! Just leave! Come on! Get out, Danny! Oh my God! No! No! No! Danny... No... No... Stop it! Get out! Danny! If you're lighting up this house, you're going down with it! Oh crap! Maybe this is the best way. We both go... end this craziness. But not before I torch your nuts and shove them down your throat. - What the hell? - Sally! He's trying to kill me, again. Aidan, it's Sally! You know how long I've wanted to do that? Are you done, my friend? Are you OK? You can see her? Sally? We can see her because we're like her. What? Ahh! No, no, no, wake up. Wake up. Don't do it! He deserves it! Don't he? Sally, if you kill him, he'll be here forever. He'll haunt you! Please! I'll never come back! He's lying! He will never leave you alone! Listen, I know what it feels like to kill someone. You cannot live it down! It doesn't matter! I'm already dead! You can have the house! I'll give it to you! Please! We've all killed here, except for you. We've all killed someone. Do not do this. You don't want to do this. Unh... No one deserves to die more than you do. And nobody deserves to kl l you more than I do. But I'm not like you. Sally... You didn't just get saved. What you're gonna get, you're gonna pray and cry and wish you were dead. Ah... what happened. What do you want me to say? I did it. I tried burning down my house, my tenants' house. Tell them why you're really here. But actually, um... I killed my fiancée... in the house. And when did this happen? My fiancée, Sally, she's haunting me. She's gonna kill me, her and the guys who live here... if I don't turn myself in. OK, son. It's OK. You're safe with us. We'll get it all sorted out down at the Station. Josh... Do you think Sally's OK? I don't know. I think she's relieved. And Danny? You think he's OK, too? I mean, should we send him something? I'm joking. I can't believe I'm getting that look from you right now. You know that... You know that I wasn't gonna kill him. Yes, you were. - For Sally. - Mmm. Maybe a bit because of some stuff I've been going through. - There it is. Yeah. - But mostly for Sally. When exactly do you think we should have a conversation with her about her taste in men? There's gotta be some nice dead dudes out there. You know, Sally's gonna be fine. She doesn't need you and me hovering over her shoulder with dating advice, either. Why? Is that because I'm sitting here waiting for a doctor to tell me whether or not I've impregnated my girlfriend with a mutated wolf baby? - Ha-ha! - Whoa! Caught you talking about me, huh? No, no, no. He's freaking out about the fact that he knocked me up in the break room the one and only time we had sex. Uh... It's fine. It's fine. I get that you would tell your roommate. Yeah, no, thank you for that. But I didn't tell him about the break room. And I didn't tell him about the singular-sex part. Oh. Congratulations. Thank you, Aidan. - Um... - Thank you. I should go. We were just talking about... - Josh, seriously, it's fine! - I know. It's normal! Ah man... What I wouldn't give for normal. I'd give my life to be normal. Celine... you asked me so many times, and... I think I'm finally ready. You don't have to die. You will never be sick, ever, or weak. It's like raw electricity running through your veins. Imagine the strongest that you've ever felt, the most vital, the fastest, and double it, triple it times 10, times 20. You'd turn me? You could've asked earlier, you know? When I was 20 and wanted sex 12 times a day! But you have had a life a and a family, and you can make a better decision than when you were 20. Is this about the girl? The one who didn't work out? I'm not trying to replace her. I... Just, I wanna help you. Who was I to say no to you? I just wanna give you something. You do look different. I can see it now. It's in your eyes. They're... deeper. Older. I wanted to see who Simone marries. That's my daughter. Hmm. If she gets married. I wanna see her kids, if they have her black hair... But if I see them... I'll see them grow old and sick and die, and Simone, too. Ah... I think I had my time. I had fun when I could. Why weren't you there... when I came back for you? I don't blame you. I just... I just wanna know, after all this time. What is this? You don't remember? We ran into each other on the road, you silly girl, leaving her apartment like that. Where am I? In a safe place. A quiet place. Ahh! Dammit! What did you give me? Did you turn me? Oh no, no, no, we just talked... mostly. Where's Aidan? You don't have to worry about turning your life upside down for him anymore. That's over. You said you had a great time. Ahh... I'm not gonna give up on him! Ahh! This isn't about you and Aidan. You are nothing. You're a fly with the lifespan of a fly. If he really loved you, if he really thought you were his equal, he woul've turned you like I did him. My blood is his blood. He always comes back. Y-you mean he's always leaving you. and you always have to drag him back. Unh! I hope you're not going to the station. Or, say, Canada. That train left a long time ago. He'll hate you forever. No, you'll hate me forever, and Aidan will never know. To him, you'll always be this little French what's-her-name who left when the going got tough. I'll never keep your secrets. Hmm... What about your family, Celine? Would you keep my secrets for them? It's tiresome, but I'll kill them if I have to. No! No! Kill me instead. No. No thank you. I like this. This is good. You can tell me. I was so young... headstrong... It was such a long time ago. You should be celebrating. You said Bishop's gone now. I thought that... I was afraid because I was waiting for him to... kill me. But I'm afraid of myself... of... who I will be without him to hate. The past 40 years, everything that I've done was me trying to not be... him. Everything you did was because you wanted to, good or bad. Hanging it on Bishop, that's a cop out. Wow. Is this what you're like with your daughter? Tough love? Oh, Aidan... We were happy. Figure out how to do it again. That's what you can give me. Oh... What is it? This is why your hormone levels are abnormal. You're a little over 14 weeks, not 7. What? No, no, that's not right. It can't be. Is there something wrong with it? Take a look for yourself. Fetus looks great. Ah... Excellent growth. I'll see you in a month. Thank you. She's gotta be wrong about the dates, but... you totally impregnated me... with a tiny huge-headed alien. To our future couch... brought to you by Sally, who is finally free. And to Dad, say goodbye to your life for the next 18 years. Oh my God! Um, I don't even know what I'm gonna do with myself now that Danny's gone. Oh, me neither, because, you know, that saga occupied a lot of my free time. I'm gonna go back to med school. Part-time. - Ah... - I can do that. I wanna do something for this kid. I don't want him, or her, to think that Dad is a bed-pan refresher, you know? - I do. - Yeah. And that's awesome. But, please, drink your martini before it evaporates. - Cheers. - Cheers. Ahh... Oh crap... Oh my God... How long has that been there for? You did it. Um, that's not exactly what I thought it would look like, just hanging there. Is that crazy? Like, Tony's door was just in the middle of the cemetery, which was also weird. - But this is like... - Sally. I know. It's just all so sudden. I'm not mentally prepared. You've been waiting for this. You've earned it. I mean, how many ghosts even get justice, right? Except for that chick from The Lovely Bones. I wish I could take you two with me. I guess we all go eventually, right? See you in 60 years. Give or take. Do you know what's there? On the other side? Send us pictures. Ahh! Oh my... Oh my God! Aidan! Oh my God! Oh my God! Aidan! Oh my God! Hang in there, man! You're gonna be all right! You're gonna be OK! Aidan! Aidan! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Stay with us! Come on, man! You're OK! You're OK! You're OK! You're OK!
