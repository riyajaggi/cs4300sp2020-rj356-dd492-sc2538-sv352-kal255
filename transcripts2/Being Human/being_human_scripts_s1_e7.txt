 Previously on "Being Human"... I lost my engagement ring. - Where the hell is it? - Ah! Danny killed me. Are you messing with me? Bridge. I wanna shake his very existence. - Unh! - There's an order now. There's Bishop and there's me. What's it gonna be? Us or them? I choose them.

 - I told Mom and Dad I saw you. - What did you tell them? My sweet brother went mad. Can I help you with that? Josh. - Oh my God! - Oh no! ♪ If you're gonna lie ♪ There's a reason monsters hide under the bed. ♪ I'll take you back home... ♪ We're more scared of you than you are of us. That look on your face, that scream on your lips when you eventually see us... it's enough to make us forget we were ever humans at all. She has a pretty bad gash on her head...

 some bumps and bruises. And, um, where exactly were you? I am going to find who did this. And what? Kill them? She was drunk, Aidan. Some guy came on to her in an alley. She probably pissed him off. And he was probably drunk, which is why I asked you to watch her. So... just don't do anything. Josh, I... I'm sorry. Phone call please, Dr. Roberts. Phone call please. What did Emily say about the man who attacked her? What? I don't know. What did he look like? I don't know. He offered her a light. That it's? That's all he said? He gave her some fake creeper name. Marcus, Michael, I don't know. Marcus? He said "Marcus"? I never thought you would stoop to this, cleaning up Marcus' mess. Marcus' mess? - He needs to be punished. - For what exactly? Your roommate coldcocking him in an alley or because you started doggy daycare in the first place? - Marcus beats up 19-year-old girls. That's the program you're running now? The program is a little bit different since the last time I saw you. It is out of control, even for you. Oh, I'm in control. You're the one who's slipping, Aidan. Marcus was provoked by a lesser being. He retaliated. Time was, you would've done the same thing. You know we arrested somebody last week whose pit bull killed a little girl? You let your dog run wild, Aidan. The rest is justice. You and Emily need to get out of town. What? Why? Because you can't be a werewolf and tear up a vampire on their own turf. Do you know what you've brought on yourself, on us? - Wait. What? - Marcus. Mm-hmm, yeah. Josh, the one who jumped Emily, he is a vampire and he is one of the worst. How do you know that? That cop you talked to... I tried to tell you. Josh, there is an order to things, and Bishop... He's a vampire too? God, Aidan! Shut up! Shut up! You and Emily, you need to leave town. And I need to fix this. It's that shred of humanity that makes us eventually crawl out from under the stairs and show ourselves to you. Because even a monster can be afraid of the darkness. == Sync & corrections by Alice == == for www.addic7ed.com == Bridget. Bridge. I'm here. Can you hear me? I know what he's doing to you. You're not alone. Bridget. Come on, just hear me out. Really, you can't hear me? I'm a ghost. I transcend pseudohippie rock. Leave me alone! Do you hear me? Get out of this house. Get out of my head. Just leave me the hell alone! Hey. I'm not going anywhere. I'm fine. I'm not even on the good painkillers. We're going to the house, we're getting your things and we're going. Where? We'll figure it out. It's not safe here, Em. That... guy who jumped you... he's still out there. - Oh God! He was some douche I jock-walked, OK? He's not a mass murderer. Em, just... please. Only if you take me one place. Yes, of course. Anywhere. Hiya. What's going on? I know we haven't had a chance... I think Danny's hurting Bridget and he's a psycho. I went over there to tell her that he's a total psycho and she told me to screw off. And I feel horrible 'cause I gave her the blessing to be with him in the first place. You didn't know that he was a psycho, so... I didn't subconsciously know? I didn't deliberately trick Bridget into dating him because I'm really a horrible, vengeful ghost and I wanted her to suffer like I did? - No! - Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, no, you're a vampire and also a ghost whisperer. You don't know that. What if this is about finding your door? What if part of your closure is protecting Bridget? Like condoms on a bed stand? From Danny. How am I supposed to help Bridget if she doesn't want my help? Maybe she isn't strong enough to face the trouble she's in or maybe it's you, not Bridget, that needs to make Danny stop. I wasn't strong enough in the first place. Oh, that's not true. You had plans, remember? You were gonna do something with your life. You're tough, Sally. And if you could make any physical impact on me whatsoever... I'd be wary of you. You were strong before Danny derailed you. And you know what he is now. And he can't hurt you anymore. Ah! Josh? Josh? Josh? Two years is too long. They're gonna freak. You'll be fine. No, there will be freaking. Josh, Dad caught me macking with Amy Brennan full-on second base right there. Did he freak? You got to second base with Amy Brennan? That's like my bucket list. It's Mom and Dad. You're like the prodigal son returned. Oh my God! Your father's gonna have a stroke. I'm fine. Josh. Hi, Mom. Thanks for bringing this one home. OK, so we're gonna go inside, we're gonna put something into that stomach and then we're gonna go see Dr. Ruben. - He's my paediatrician. - Since you were nothing. So he knows your body better than anybody. Well, you got that werewolf sister pretty good. If Aidan had been attacked by a pack of dogs, he would've done the same thing. Uh-huh... And you would've slapped him on the back for a job well done. Aidan never got himself into embarrassing situations like this. I think you've done enough. Josh? Yeah? I'm making chicken. You hungry? OK. " Should've been easier ♪ ♪ To wash my hands of all of this... ♪ Hey, is Mom existing in a parallel universe right now? What do you mean? You don't think she's acting a little strange, like I just got home from summer camp? She's making chicken! What would you like her to do? I don't know. She hasn't seen me in 2 years. Show some emotion? How about a guilt trip? Mom's not gonna say anything, Josh. She's... she's terrified. Of me? Of losing you. ♪ 'Cause I can't afford the doubt ♪ ♪ I can't afford the trust... ♪ And Dad? What? He's so scared of me he can't even bother to show his face? Dad doesn't live here anymore. Because? They're separated. Since when? Since when do you think? Good, you can help me with the salad. You're separated? Yes, but... you don't have to worry about that. Yes, yes, I do because, apparently Mom, I'm the one who caused it. Can we just... I would rather discuss this when your father's here, ok? I'm uncomfortable with that. I don't... Hello? Josh. Good to see you. Thanks, yeah. Can we... Do you mind if we... we... I lost it, OK? I flipped out and I am so sorry if I caused or contributed to whatever happened here, OK? But it's just... It's vitally important that you both know I'm OK. Whatever it was that I had, it's under control. I've seen a doctor, I'm on medication, I'm working in a hospital in Boston. I'm actually sort of... happy. Really. So just... You don't... you don't need to worry about me, OK? Thank you, Josh, for sharing that. Yes, thank you. OK, guys, seriously, can we just stop thanking each other and act like blood relatives for a minute? You don't have to treat me with kid gloves either. If you wanna shout, shout. OK. So long has it been, Josh? Uh, how long has what been? How long have you thought you were a werewolf? Did I just... Did you just say... Did I just hear you say that you thought that I thought that I was a... Where did you get that? That's my personal... Emily. That's... that's not even... Do you really think that I think that I'm a werewolf? Do you, Josh? No, Mom! God! I... Why would you even think that? "Scientific research has confirmed one fundamental fact: "I'm a werewolf. "But my research has yet "to answer the Why?" Yes. You think that's me. Guys! I hate to break it to you, but those are... that... those are notes for a graphic novel about a guy who thinks he's a wolf. Guys. Tell you what. Let's eat, catch up and... then we can talk. Let's do that. As it is the business of any legal action to discover if compelling evidence may be produced. That's right. How does it feel? Maybe one tenth of how scared you made me? Sally? Sally, is that you? Oh! 'Cause if it is, I've got a question for you. That's the best you've got? A busted light bulb and some spilt beer? This is supposed to scare me? Really? God, Sally! You're more pathetic as a ghost than you were alive. And let's just be clear here. That's pretty pathetic. What? You know, I heard about you roaming the halls of our old place. Baby, that's just sad. You still don't have anything better to do than wait for me to come home. That's never who I wanted to be. You made me into that! And all that crap about how I made you give up your dreams. You were just waiting for me to knock you up so you could sit at home and watch Lifetime. SHUT UP! You know, you might scare Bridget with this crap, sweetheart, but you don't scare me. Because I know you're nothing. You're dead. And I'm alive. I'm alive. And I'm happy... finally. So... at least you got your next book, right? Mom has a breakdown, Emily starts kissing girls and your son thinks he's a werewolf. You gotta admit, it's pretty much the psychotherapy jackpot, don't you think? Don't do that. Don't what? Don't shrink me. You said you wanted to talk. Let's talk. I'm just trying to understand. So ask! Scream... I'm your son. You can talk to me. I'm sorry. I... thought you needed help. I got scared. I swear to God, if that's my high-school math teacher here for an intervention, I'm gonna cut my face off. Just hear me out. I can help. What? You can't be here. - Josh, Josh, let me in. - No, no! This is my family. You must be Josh's mother. Yes. I'm Aidan. I'm Josh's roommate. Oh! He's just passing through. He's leaving. Actually, I'd kill for a glass of water. Oh, well, we can do better than water. - You like roast chicken? - No, Mom. I love roast chicken. Good. Well, all right then. Come on in. So, Aidan, you and Josh met at the hospital. We did. Their place is actually decent, Mom. Not your typical bachelor-roofie den. Ah, that's reassuring. Hmm... Uh, this chicken is delicious. Thank you, Aidan. So Josh says that he's happy. See, are you two, uh, happy as roommates? Mom! We are. Yeah, he is, really. - You don't mind if I... - If you what? Josh had a girl over the other night. Ahem! No, I don't mind. Please continue. Just a great girl. Smart and funny. And I don't mean to sell your son out. No, of course not. But get a couple glasses in him, and he actually knows how to charm a lady. We're OK with drinking on the medication? I'm not... I don't... do that. No, I think it's good to have other forms of... recreation. - Oh my God! - I'd be worried if you were spending all the time on that book. What book? My graphic novel, ahem, about werewolves that my family thinks is a personal journal. My personal journal. Hold on for a second. So... OK, you think that Josh thinks that he's a werewolf? Right? It's nuts on toast, right? Yeah. So, guys, can we put this to bed now please? I'm not crazy. It's not a journal, OK? I don't believe that I'm a wolf. I don't believe in monsters. You know why? 'Cause there's no such thing as monsters. Aidan, are you OK? I'm fine. I'm sorry. Um... Here's the deal. You know what? He just went through a bad breakup. I'm gonna go check on him because I don't think he's all right. Just something happened. I... I don't know. Uh... Are you kidding me? Now? You have to do this now? Does your mom cook with garlic? I don't know. Seriously, is that a thing? - Yes or no, Josh! - I guess so. Does it kill you? No, no, it doesn't. It just... It makes us, us. OK, OK, so stop being you. How? How do we do that? Uh, feverfew. Fever... what? Is that a band? It's an herb, Josh! OK, how about any other herb? Any other herb, like, on earth! Mistletoe? How about matzo meal? Anything I don't have to summon a warlock for? OK, all right. Everything's fine. Aidan's just having a reaction to something he ate, so I'm bringing him some camomile tea, some camomile tea. OK, OK. So we have camomile- lavender, camomile-mint. I think there's like a lemon in here. And you're naked and taking a bath in the middle of dinner. Out! Um, I don't wanna be in here. OK, fine, good. Out! Out! Out! You got rain on the drive, huh? Well, they said we might get some tonight. Hello, Josh. Don't open that door. Do not invite that man into this house. Just don't! What? Oh, this is ridiculous! No, Dad, don't! Josh, why don't you tell me what you think is happening right now? Son, this isn't a solution. - Take this. - Josh. If he gets inside, you need to cut his head off. Cut it off completely. - Do you understand me? - What? OK, yes, keep them behind you, all right? Josh! This is crazy! Just do what I say. Aidan! Aidan! - Josh, what's going on? - Not now, Dad. The lengths you go to, to protect them now! And the lengths you'll go to, to kill when you tell Bishop you failed! Bishop didn't send me. Whatever's going on, Josh, we can sit down and talk about it. He didn't ever want me to mess with his little prince's pet. So you come out here on your own to the suburbs to what? Kill them all? Who are you trying to hurt? The dog you keep saying is beneath you, or me? If this is about us, then you keep it between us! Oh! Bishop would never let me do what I truly wanna do with you. Come on out! Here, boy! - Oh my God! - Josh, put it down! Josh, wait! Come on, little doggie! Aidan! I got this. Aaah! Oh! Oh! You kill me now if you think you've got it in you and you pay the price of Bishop, but you leave my friend and his family out of it. You and your doggie aren't worth it. I know you don't wanna admit it. You think it'll get better in a couple weeks. Hmm? A couple months. If you wear a new dress. If you try a new position. If you bake the perfect frigging cake. This isn't you, Bridget. And it wasn't me. It's just how Danny got into our heads. And I swear to God I'm gonna make him stop. But I need you to help me. I need you to understand what he did to me. I know you feel me. Are you there? Why are you doing this? You need help. There's no way to fix what's wrong with me. There is always a solution. No, there isn't. You just need to be open to accepting it. You... just refuse to see this as anything other than black and white, don't you? Like you always did, like we're part of your next study. You keep saying that. Is that how you feel? Like I've studied you? No, if you'd studied me, you would've realized something was wrong. Let me ask you something. Before I left, before I flipped out, did it ever occur to you that I was unhappy? - You were driven. - You were driving me! What are you saying? You don't have a problem? Because healthy people don't do this, Josh. Healthy people don't run out on their family, their fiancée, their future without more than a scrap of paper saying "I'm sorry." Maybe I pushed too hard. But only because you always acted like that was what you wanted out of life. Son... you can't possibly want this. We'll help you, Josh, whatever this is. Please! You can't possibly want this. I don't. You're right. You're right. It's not a graphic novel. It's not fantasy. It's happening to me. What is happening to you, baby? I'm a werewolf. That's who I am. That's why I left. What possible place is there for me here? Are you OK? I need you to tell me how Sally died. You know how she died. You were practically the first to know. Keep going, Bridge. You're doing the right thing. Did you kill her? What? How could you... How could you say that to me? 'Cause I think that's what she's saying to me. Finally. It was an accident. So it's true? No! No. Look, Sally and me, it wasn't like how you and I are, Bridget. We weren't happy. I never fought with anyone like I fought with her. She made me so... I wasn't myself. So it's my fault? She was so strong! You know how Sally was. I felt like she didn't need me. I got insecure. So you had to beat me down. And that night, she lost her ring. The ring. She said it went down the drain. And I didn't believe her. So... we got into a fight. I grabbed her arm. She fell, but I would never... Ah! God, I didn't... No. So she thinks you killed her. God! Maybe I did, Bridge. God! Maybe I did, but I never would've... She was everything to me. You know, I keep trying to take back that second when her ankle twisted. Bridget, no, he's not sorry. You know, every morning, I wake up and I think about how I ruined my life, our life. Bridget, no. I loved her so much. Bridget. Bridget, do not believe him. It was an accident. I know that now. ♪ ♪ ♪ It was strangely thrilling to finally just... say it to them. And yet, somehow... incredibly anticlimactic. You know, I tried the same thing... a long time ago. My wife and my son. I thought there must be some way to explain it to them, to, uh, be what I had become... and keep them. In time, they would understand. They're my family. That's what I told myself. What happened? We should go. What if you were right? Trying, I mean. I can manage this. It's one night a month. I can... No, it's bigger than that. And Marcus? I mean, what if he's... I'm supposed to just leave my family if he's coming back? No, he's not. It's between me and him now. But, Josh, he was coming after you. You do not make it safer here. I can explain it to them... walk them through it. They're educated; they're reasonable. So you explain it to them, and maybe one day, they'll even believe that you are a wolf. And so they'll build you a cage. And it'll work. Every month, you'll transform in the comfort of your own home. And in the morning, your parents will be waiting for you with food and water. And they will clean you like the day that you were born because... because he's not a monster. He's our son. And he would never, ever hurt us. So one day, someone will leave the cage unlocked because what's the worst that can happen? And brutally, against your human will... you will kill them all. I won't let it get to that. I know what I'm doing now. I'll go to the woods. No matter what you do, they're gonna wanna get involved. They're your family. Which is exactly why they're defenseless against you. I've already hurt them too much not to try. Aidan! Oh, what a nice surprise! Who are they? Well, I told you things had changed. Some things never change. You stay away from my friends. Sure. Aidan... You stink like one, you know? Yeah, it's all over you. Doggie stink, doggie sweat, doggie tears. Folks are gonna start to wonder. How our family could turn its back on its own? Turn its back on the weakest among us? We have too much to do in too little time to lay waste to the one strength we have. That goes for the weakest. And that goes for the mistakes. ♪ Who would've thought the boy could fly... ♪ - So you think Dad's gonna run off with some 25-year-old babe? How jealous would you be? How jealous would you be? You're gonna stay, right? For a while? I could come home once a month, help out. Whatever you need. ♪ 'Cause only the dreamer knows ♪ Come on. ♪ That life is not ♪ ♪ The world you see ♪ Josh, come have some chicken. ♪ It gets better than this ♪ ♪ Imagination exists ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're not alone ♪ ♪ You carried the weight of us all ♪ ♪ You're not alone anymore ♪ ♪ Still tryin' to bring us home ♪ ♪ Remember the hero ♪ ♪ The boy that could reach to your soul ♪ ♪ You're not alone anymore ♪ ♪ Who would've thought the boy could fly? ♪ Hello? Sally? I'm here. I'm sorry... about how you died. And I miss you... every day. But this is the last time I'm gonna talk to you. And if you come to me, if you haunt me or Danny... I won't acknowledge you... no matter how loud you scream... no matter how scared I am. This ends now. He'll do it to you. It's just who he is. You're not at rest. I get that now. But it didn't happen the way you think it did. Just accept that. Accept that and maybe you can find some peace and move on. We're moving on. And you need to leave us alone. ♪ My old friend ♪ ♪ Tell me, where have you been? ♪ ♪ Have I wasted away? ♪ ♪ All my tears turn to time ♪ ♪ My old friend ♪ And what happened?
