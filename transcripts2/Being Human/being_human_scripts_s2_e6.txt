 Previously... Cecilia, this is Aidan. - I'm a cop. - You turned her? You don't know anything about her. When you turned me, you made it sound like steak dinners and chorus girls. All you had to do was say yes and everything would be different. I gave you everything. You never come back here again. It's been 80 years.

 Henry? You guys wanna be wolves all the time! Josh, this is Will, my ex. It happens almost every night. I watch him. Is anyone here? She's clawing at the surface. - Oh my god! - I know that it's my wolf. No! Aaah! She just wants to run free. I've never felt anything so strong, But I can't control it. ♪ I was restless ♪ ♪ I was young... ♪

 One of the worst parts of dying was that split-second when it hit me... "Mom and Dad aren't gonna save me from this." I closed my eyes, hoping that it was a bad dream, that Mom would wake me up. But instead I woke up into this. ♪ Into a light... ♪ Aidan? Slummin' it with us orphans? I need you to get a message out before you're too drunk. Yeah, I'm listening. I'm looking for Henry. Henry knows better than to be here. I know, I know. Just get the word out. ♪ Sit in chairs... ♪ And shut this damn thing down by morning. You don't realize until it's too late what your parents did to protect you from the truth. Hi, it's me. Not here. Leave a message after the beep. Hey, it's, um... Nora, it's me. I got your message. I wish I could say I understand why you left. But I know you don't wanna talk right now, so I'm talking... to your voicemail. Our parents read us fairy tales thinking they'll never have to explain that they aren't real... thinking they'll be dead and gone before reality hits. But blood is forever. 20, 30, 300 years down the line... Sally's mom. ...we still need a hand to reach for in the dark. ♪ Here to stay ♪ Sync and corrections by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com - When was the last time you saw your mom? - Awake? No, but I mean, when was the last time you actually talked to her? Do you think she's gonna die? What's the right answer here? Sorry, sir, I'm just gonna take the sheets, if that's OK. Mom? Is she-- You need to get somebody to change her clothes. She wouldn't want to be stuck in a hospital gown for all... this. Hey, Dad. You have to help him. He obviously hasn't eaten. He's gonna get sick. You have to get him something. - What? - Get him some--some-- I don't know, some pudding. Pudding? Sally, he'll think I'm a crazy person. Did you need something? No, I... Do you need something? You can't ask him. He's just gonna say no. Just get him some pudding. Butterscotch. Sorry, sir. No, no! Chocolate, chocolate! OK, then. Rena? I thought we'd all be so much older when this happened. Sometimes it's just a pudding day, huh? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Josh Levinson, right? Wow, two for two. Do we know each other? I'm Det. Sherwood, this is Det. Raimes. Boston PD. You have a minute? Yeah, I just bought some pudding. It's--it's room temp, so it should be fine. Hello. Should we walk? Yeah, uh, do we have a mission statement for this walk? Your name came up during the course of an investigation and we're just here to clear the site. What kind of an investigation? Do you remember where you were on the 26th, Josh? OK, I'm sorry. I really need to know what's going on. Were you with Nora? - What? - Nora Sergeant. Your girlfriend. A man named William Cart was found dead and mutilated at his worksite last week, and he's an ex of your girlfriend's. Josh, what are you-- See, I--I didn't... Not have a conversation with him at this hospital the day he died? I wouldn't call it a conversation. Right. You knew the history between Will and Nora, right? - History? As in... - Restraining order. Burns on her stomach. Don't even pretend you didn't know about that. Where's Nora, Josh? I don't know. That is God's honest truth. I don't know. Right. Think about it, then give us a call. Pudding here is the bomb. Remember that lake we used to drive up to in Maine? Mom hated the bugs and you lit all those citronella candles and tried to make it romantic, till Robbie knocked one over and set fire to the campsite and that ranger kicked us out. The car ride home was the best part. We drove all night, Mom singing, you drumming at the wheel. It felt like home in that car. You made her happy, Dad. She had a good life. And that makes things better on the other side, trust me. Mr. Malik. - Mom? - Sally? Ah! How is this possible? We're ghosts, Mom. I've missed you so much. Your rainy-day sweater. You always said it made you feel safe. Yeah, well, it didn't exactly protect me. You look great, Mom. I told Josh that you'd be happy that they changed your clothes. You told who? Oh yeah, well, it's a long story. Well, we have time now, right? Oh, I haven't moved in months! You know, really moved. Can we-- can we get out of here? - Whoa, wait! What about Dad? - What? We should go. We should check on Dad, make sure he's OK, even though he can't see us. Uh, of course. Of course. So you're saying I can't change out of these pants? 'Cause I really saw myself in a dress. You know, that red one? Just pace yourself, Mom. Eternity. ♪ This could be the end of the line ♪ ♪ In the blink of an eye ♪ ♪ This could be the end of the line ♪ You're not going to stop now, are you, after you're starting to be fun again? You are so blood-drunk right now, you probably don't even think I'm really here. Come on, Aidan. Remember Antietam? We fed like fiends. Come on, you remember. You had visions then too. Your wife? Brynne, we have a guest. Where's Nora? Where is she? Please be cool. OK, yeah. Sure. The, um, the cops cornered me at my place of work today. How 'bout you guys? Did they get you? Oh, that's right! You don't work, you skulk. Where is she? I see you heard about Will, then? You wanna pitch in on some flowers? Something simple, yet elegant. I know you had something to do with this, damn it! Of course, we did. The 3 of us. No, she wouldn't. She wouldn't? Do you even know the woman you're supposedly in love with? He burned her! And that's just the scar that stuck. Who knows what else he did to her. - He deserved to die. - Like that? The man who sent your girlfriend to the hospital deserves to die playing shuffleboard? I--I just think-- That's just it! All right? You think! We act. We're a pack. There was a threat, and look at that, it's been resolved. It's being investigated! Trust me. The way he looked, no human did that to him. We took care of her, in ways that... ...you clearly can't. This is insane. Huh! OK. Guys, I--I don't know what you're saying to her, but she won't return my phone calls. I just need to see her. She needs to be alone right now. Really? She doesn't need her pack? I'm really sorry you're acting this way. I only have to hope that you'll come around. Or what? You'll viciously maul me in my sleep? Come on, now. We're all wolves here. We'll give you a chance to run. He's joking. So, I see you're drinking again. And boffing the princess. No, you know, you leave her out of this. Mr. Holier-Than-Thou turned out to be the most ruthless one of us all, didn't he? You have no idea what you're even talking about. Really? I have a severed head that says different. Aidan, you killed me. You're probably gonna kill Henry. You'll cut yourself a path straight to the castle's front door. Whatever it takes to rule side by side with Suren. It's not who I am. It's not what I want. Yeah, I think it is. Maybe you'll kill her too. Let's, you and me, make no mistake. You want it more than I ever did. Hey, don't get me wrong. I am not here to criticize. I salute you, my son. You're a lot closer than I ever was. OK, first order of business. Kill Henry. I can't. I--I--I don't know where he is. I--I-- Aidan? You wanna knock back a few pints of live to get your strength up, I get it. But you're his maker. You know. So, shirt, cool leather jacket. Come on, let's stake this bitch. The horse? Yes. It looked just like that. - No kidding? - Yes. Hey, doughboys! Bishop. Look at you. Yes! Yankee Doodle do or die. James Bishop, might I present Private Henry Durham, US Army, the finest medic who ever lived? - Or died. - Shhh! And then was born again. Thanks to your progeny here and of course, to you. Yes, uh, Aidan told me quite a bit about you in his letters. You wrote about me, did you? We never take a turn lightly. Yeah, you should certainly make sure you're choosing wisely. I'll just go say goodbye to the fellas. Well, at least you hate him. No. No, I like him. It's just, um, how does that saying go? "We choose in our children what we think we see in ourselves." And Henry has a touch of the rebellious in him, wouldn't you say? No, Bishop. He practically bent over backwards to kiss your rings. He's a company man. Trust me. As were you. But I don't wanna ruin the discoveries of fatherhood for you. Let's get a drink. I know a place. Well, this brings us back. What exactly do you think it is you're gonna find here? He showed himself the other night. He could've ran. We used to come here back in the day to feed. They came in droves from the mountains, the farms, the hollows, with nothing but the shirts on their backs and hope. God, we had a time. Look at you, Aidan, clinging to what? A memory, a moment in time, trying to find some beauty that is the wreckage of your son. - You found it in me. - Because you were worth it. He's a good man. Who stabbed you in the back to sleep with Suren, drove her to ground, drove all of us into the shadows. You have got to kill him. He was young. How many times did you take a bullet for me? It's not just anybody he's organizing. - That's my army. - That's it, isn't it? Organized, you got a problem. - This is your freedom. - Oh my-- What if the only thing that stands between you and it is Henry. Now you want me to be free? You spent centuries chasing me around with a butterfly net. Let's get something else to eat. I know these things are never easy. Drink up. It's best if these things happen in a blur. Kids. Am I right? Thank you so much. Uh-uh. Mom? Mr. Patterson? Sally? Wow, you're-- you're all grown up! I'm dead, Mr. Patterson. It's OK, Sally. Mom, get out of him! It's your funeral. Hey. You've done some work on the place. Hey. - You OK? - Never better. Is that a cat wearing a catcher's mask? - That's cute. - Where were you last night? Aidan, you're cute. Just waiting on a friend. You don't have any friends. I mean, like--like fantasy football or poker buddies. You don't have, like, guys like that. So what friend? - Is it Princess Suren? - It was an old friend. Oh my god! Is your wife always this much of a nag? I'm old, Josh. OK. Well, now that you're here, listen. That cop you turned-- I didn't turn-- Turning cops now? No, I didn't turn her. OK, well, I need her. And what business do you have with the police? Can we be real just for, like, a minute and not pretend she's just the police, Aidan? The cops are after Nora, and I need your vampire cop, Cecilia, to help make all this go away in the way that you do. Really? You know I don't like asking you for this, but... Nora killed her ex-boyfriend. Oh my god! Not her, but her wolf. And still, not really her. I mean, it was the, uh, purebreds. Josh, really-- Aidan, listen. I know you've done this a thousand times. You can't make this one thing go away just for me? Oh, I can think an easy way to make this... - Please. - ...go away. Yeah, absolutely. Let's do that. I will appeal to the newly turned vampire cop. I'll say, "Cecilia, my friend Josh-- Oh, maybe you know him! "He's the werewolf who wanted to take down Bishop." We know how that turned out! Well, his girlfriend, oops! She killed Hegeman, so there's that. - OK, this is... - She also kind of mauled her-- - It wasn't just her, Aidan! - That's right, the purebreds! We gotta tell everyone about the purebreds! So, kind of brutally murdered her ex-boyfriend. So if you could just sweep all this under the rug, that would be great. This is cute what you're doing. THAT'S BECAUSE I'M CUTE! Look, I'm just-- All I'm saying, Josh, is that, uh, this isn't who you are. Well, thank you for thinking that. But sadly, I think it's exactly who I am. I'm the guy with an antique rifle loaded with silver, werewolf- killing bullets under my bed. - You have Hegeman's rifle? - Yeah. Oh! And they will find all of this and more when they come after me with their questions and their evidence. Where was I on the night of the 26th? Well, I was turning into a werewolf in my storage unit. Here's the key and here's a videotape of the whole thing! How else may I be of service? You really need to kill this guy. Great. So I'll just see you at work, barring my imminent arrest. Oh! And oh yeah, Sally's mom died. But Sally's great. She's great. I don't understand. Mr. Patterson died when I was 10. What, did you, like, have a pact or something? We never dreamed it would actually happen. Mom, are you aware of where you are right now? Your husband is mourning you, 10 feet away. Sally, life is long. Um, not really, Mom. I know this is heavy, Sally, I mean, your mom and me, death. Yeah, Gerry, it's, like, really far out there. You were my neighbour. You helped my dad build my tree house. When you and my mom were making iced tea, I had no idea that you were-- Ugh! If I could puke right now, I would, I swear to God. Take a deep breath, Sally. We're beyond it. We beyond all of it, you know, our earthly ties, the restrictions of the flesh. Now I know why you sat in the dark for a week when Gerry died. So you understand, right? It was real? No, Mom. I actually don't understand anything right now. Honey, I just died. Can we take a moment before we get into all of this? Mom, I was more than willing to take many moments with you. Do you have any idea how much I missed you? And then the first free second you have, you're grinding on some gravestone with Gerry? Tell you what. I would love to see your place, you know, curl up, have some girl time. God! Mom, that was so awkward when I was 13 too. OK. So? Should we go check out the wake? Cecilia, right? Do I know you? I think you do, yeah. Can I help you? You're investigating a girl named Nora Sergeant. I'd like you to stop. I don't even know what you're talking about. - Aidan didn't-- - Aidan? Nora hasn't done anything wrong. I know that, Aidan knows that, and I'm sure he's getting around to telling you that. You're not doing him any favors asking me to pull strings for a werewolf. Wait! I may be new, but I'm not stupid. But I-- I know about-- What if I can get you 2 wolves? My building doesn't allow dogs. Purebreds. You said yourself, you're new. Wouldn't this be some kind of prize? Especially if-- If you knew they were the wolves that killed Hegeman? You know who he was, right? Nora who? Sergeant. She's like you? That's funny. This case wasn't even on my radar. But now I'll be sure to give it my full attention. Thanks so much. Oh, hey! You came. Huh? Oh yeah. Oh my god! I have so many questions to ask your mom about you. What's up with you? What's up with you? Why would a ghost ring a doorbell? To instil a sense of occasion? I don't know. My mom's brand new. She has no skills. Stop. Josh, you think you could get it? Sure, why don't I get it? Thank you. Uh, oh! Oh, and don't mention anything about being a werewolf. Right, 'cause I usually lead with that. What's up with him? Look, um, Mom didn't come over much when Danny was around. And it's been years since we were able to sit down and just be us. I want that. I miss that. OK. OK, that is, um... Like someone threw up in a coffee cup and microwaved it? Come on in. So, these are your friends? Otherwise totally normal friends that can see dead people. You're not a vampire? Yes. I'm gonna go check on the, uh, on the lasagne. Gerry is so knowledgeable about the beyond. Why am I yet again cooking dinner for people who don't eat? - Stay there! - Murderer! - Stay there! - Turn around! You didn't think we'd find it? Find what? Your stack of dead! I don't have a stack of dead! Stop lying! - No, please, please, don't! - Hey. Are you coming? Are you crying? It was a hot oven... I'm gonna go ahead and dial back the crazy a little bit and just serve myself if that's cool with--with you guys. The place looks great, honey. We burned it. That helped. Well, Danny always stifled your aesthetic. Yeah. I mean, it rocks that you're free of him, Sally. Yeah, it's awesome. It's funny how things were with Danny, huh? I wasn't happy, but I stayed for years, lying to myself, to my family. Sally, you don't-- You don't wanna-- - But I do. Was there something about Dad that I'm missing? Was he verbally or physically abusing you while he wasn't rubbing your feet or leaving you poems on the kitchen counter? You're making that up. - I'm not! - One poem! Would two have stopped you from boffing the neighbour? I don't expect you to understand. Oh good! - She's still young. - I know. It hasn't occurred to you that your parents could be individuals, have a life of their own? No, I get that, Mom. I really do. Having your own life, that's fine. Having an extramarital affair that leaks into your death, that's not fine. I died and you didn't even know how! For so long, I've been waiting for you to hold me, for you to tell me what to do. And you've just been waiting for him. Sally, I love you. I loved your father, but... Yes! Yes, I have a vital relationship with Gerry that I have had to mourn in silence for over a decade and that is what I want to spend the rest of my time exploring. Wow. OK. I appreciate the honesty, I guess. - I'll get it. - I got it. - Don't get it! - I got it. You better not invite them in! Because of the vampires. 'Cause the vampires. 'Cause if you invite them in, then they might p-p-potentially kill us all, or just me, 'cause I'm the only one still-- I'm gonna go! I'm--I'm gonna let myself out. Uh, Gerry, Rena, it was... I'd ask to come in, but the last time I tread on your territory, things didn't go so well. Can we talk? Josh? Mind if we have a look at those? I moved around a lot. Pacific Northwest mostly. Easy to disappear there. And you? Eating's been good, I see. Why did you come back, Henry? I'd heard you killed Bishop. I heard you were supposed to be running Boston. I came to support you. Oh, and instead, you've fallen in with the orphans. I haven't fallen in with them. I taught them a few things. Survival. Blood dedens in plain sight. A fighting chance. Bishop, you, left them with nothing. No tools. I've been out there for 80 years. I couldn't just sit back and watch them die. I want back in the family, Aidan. I didn't come back for her, if that's what you're scared of. Aidan, I'm tired of hiding. Can you, with any honesty, tell me you're the same vampire I left 80 years ago? Can you tell me Suren's the same vampire who exposed us all? With any God-given grace, time heals, time matures. I think it was you who tried to teach me that. Funny. Most people who rent places like this, they fill them with boxes, bowling trophies. Not too many people have video cameras and cages. So you can see how this isn't looking good for you. How did you guys even know to look here? We followed you, genius. We thought you'd lead us to your girlfriend, but... How did these get here? Yeah, I know... Those were here when I rented the place. It's weird. We can always ask the rental manager, see if he's seen or heard anything strange. Looks like the ones at the scene, right? Cages, video cameras claw marks on the walls. We're cuffing this guy, right? This young man is a sick bastard, but he's not our guy. No. No, he's definitely not our guy. Hold up, hold up, hold up! W-w-what? We're gonna forget his dopy little face after this. I'll be holding on to that tape. Yes, ma'am. This is where you thank me. Yes, well, I'm not exactly sure of our arrangement yet. Well, I thought you were making the purebred thing up. Well, you're new. You really wanna be a smart-ass now? No. No, ma'am. Bring them to me. I can't be any more involved. Whatever set up you've got here and the one next door for your girlfriend, I'm guessing you're already pretty damn involved. I want the purebreds. So, babe, I'm gonna go. It's OK. You two need to be alone together without me. I'll see you back at the place? Please tell me the place isn't the cemetery, 'cause that's gross and weird. No, it's this tree we used to go to-- OK! OK. I wanted to come here alone, you know, walk in the door, hug you, talk about the wallpaper. But we're dead. And the way you died is-- You'll never understand this because you'll never have a daughter. For that, I am so sorry. But for me, to see you here... my amazing daughter... still in this house where you were with him, I mean, living, dying, to see this is my idea of hell. So what? It's just-- It's easier with Gerry? I failed you even when you were alive. How can I help you now? Can't you try? How much time do we have? No offense, Mom, but if someone in your situation were to get her door right now, I am done with this dimension. I haven't taken an easy breath for most of a century. How can I come back? Henry, I told you before. There is no coming back. You can't mean that. Not aft-- You killed your maker. You flouted the very principals you're now standing on. It was never about principals. It was about love, you ant. I have to ask you something. I've heard things. You and Suren-- Henry, choose your words carefully. After all the warnings you gave me to stay away from her, really? Are you just going to stand there and listen to him talk about your woman that way? Your woman! Oh, Aidan, grow a pair. Then you're truly in love with her. I don't know. I don't know. Maybe. Then where does that leave me? Dead. You think he's going to choose his wayward son over the royal you scorned? My blood, my name will be on that throne of power. And I'll use your head for a footstool. Take him, Aidan. Do it. - Aidan. - Destroy him! I said where does that leave me? That's what I'm trying to figure out. Really? 'Cause I think I know. Aidan! I've wasted 80 years, fearing this moment. Maybe it'll be a relief. Do it, Aidan. Do it. You're a killer, man. You always have been. Embrace it. This is freedom. This is power. All these years, wondering if you were dead or alive, wishing that I'd killed you! And then missing you. I can't do this anymore. What, then, do you suggest? If it's the shadows again, kill me now. No, I'm gonna find a way to make this right for you. That's what you said to our brethren too, the orphans. They weren't mine to save. You are. I hope you give me reason to believe you. I just couldn't do it. Course you couldn't. Where's your mom? Comingling in some tree. Thank you for cooking the most awkward meal of all time. I pretty much have the market cornered on that. When I was a kid, I kind of just thought my parents were-- I don't know, waiting around, doing nothing until I came back in the room. That's what Aidan and I do. She had a life. And I'm sitting here judging her for it. I'm never gonna know what it's like to want to protect my child and fail. I don't think it has to be your child.
