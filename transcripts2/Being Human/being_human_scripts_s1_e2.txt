 You shouldn't have to run into the woods every time you turn. How could 4 walls and a toilet possibly help this? There was an engaged couple living here. She died. - In here? - Someone's in the house? - You can hear me? - Yeah. - She's a ghost. - Shut up. - How did you die? - I have no idea. The point of this house was having one place where we can be human. Hey, it's me. I need your help. Good to see you back, Aidan.

 There's Bishop and there's me. - Emily? Sorry. - Josh? - What are you doing? Josh! - Go! No... My sister's here and the door is locked. I will kill her. Life is a series of choices. As it turns out, death isn't the same. Not for the ones who are ready. They embrace their fate, move on. For the rest of us, we linger. After our survivors pray and throw dirt on our coffins, we're still waiting, because for some of us, there's a bigger question...

 What am now? Where do I go from here? Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com We find ourselves in an eternal nowhere, between human... and thing. Monsters. Hey! Hey, we got something alive over here! Some of these monsters choose to simply accept what they've become. Roger that. Ambulance is on its way. ♪ If I look mad... ♪ Some don't. ♪ Think back ♪ Oh! ♪ Think back... ♪ Which leaves us with the most important choice. Do you accept what you are? Or do you refuse? Ahh! Ahh! And which is the true curse? Where am I? Oh... What is this? Everything's fine. I promise. You just need a bite to eat. Where's Aidan? He'll be so happy that you're here. Aidan? Are you here? Aidan! Ahh! Josh? You're scaring me. Just stay away from me! Do you want me to... Can I get you help? Stay away from me! Aidan, I'm in the room. It's locked, and Emily's here. If you get this, please... Josh! What do you mean, "He has a condition"? He's your brother. You should ask him yourself. My brother had a nervous breakdown and ran away from his family 2 years ago. He doesn't tell me anything. If he's in some kind of trouble... No, no, no. He's a good guy. He's a great roommate. He's dealing with some stuff, yeah, but... aren't we all? Does he... Does he have any friends? Josh? You kidding me? Yeah. 'Cause he never really did. Oh, come on. OK, he's quirky. You think? He talks about you, you know. Um, what he said... was that he always studied so hard learning medicine, how to save a life, but that you were the one who knew how to truly live. Did he say that? I... I can't believe my sweet brother went mad. Our mother did, too, you know. Bet he didn't tell you that. Yeah, you wouldn't know it now. She's back on the tennis court- book club circuit. The incident has been neatly filed away. Just our little family curse. I think we're all a little cursed that way. Please. You're hot! What can I do for you? Can I call somebody? Jackie's waiting for me upstairs. God, what if he never even gets to meet Jackie? I really wanted to rub it in his face that I ended up with a shiksa goddess. ♪ It's like you said ♪ ♪ This is way too tough ♪ ♪ We've got no way to make it out there all alone ♪ ♪ Out there on our own ♪ ♪ When times get tough, you got my back ♪ ♪ Don't know what I'd do ♪ ♪ Without you, I'd be all alone ♪ ♪ Out there on my own ♪ How are you? Well, I didn't kill my sister... so I guess I can't complain. Josh, I'm really sorry. I tried. I just... couldn't. It's OK. Really? Sure. I mean, I don't even know what I expected you to do. What? Figuring out an acceptable amount of time to pass before I tell you something. OK. Danny's coming over. What? And I'm really glad you didn't kill your sister. What? Aidan! Aidan, why... why is Danny coming over? Sally really, really wanted to see him. - Poh! - Sorry. OK, am I the only one who thinks that Danny coming over is a tremendously bad idea? What if he sees you? I'll crap rainbows, I swear to God! She's a ghost. He ain't gonna see her. Well, wait, sometimes they do see them, normal people. But he would have to be, you know, open, mentally. Danny's pretty open. He voted for Hillary. It's fine. OK, look, if he sees you, if he senses you, do you have any idea what that would do to him? What it would do to us? He could sell the place! He could sell tickets like that guy who saw Jesus on the taco shell! Listen, if he comes, I think that Sally should stay upstairs. And I think that you don't get a say. On the stairs. At least! Top of the stairs. And no peeking! Oh, just... don't be weird, OK? - Yeah, I got it. - You too, Amityville. Top of the stairs. Everyone just be... normal. Got it. Hey. Top of the morning to you, captain! Oh jeez! So, do you wanna check out the sink first, or... I'm just gonna go check on the....... Wait, upstairs? But the breakers are in the basement. Yeah, right, it's in the basement. Sure, but I've got a lot of stuff. There's stuff plugged in upstairs that I've got for work. A lava lamp, radio. Probably too many things. A power strip plugged into another power strip... So, the sink... What are you doing? Just let me see him. What if that's the closure I need? What if it's not? What if it only makes you feel worse? Trust me, as bad as you feel now, there's always worse, OK? So could you just... Ah... OK. Do you know what you're doing? Ha! You know, when I bought this place, I thought, hey, this is a perfect opportunity for me to learn how to fix stuff, you know? And then I had to move out. Everyone who moved in complained about the plumbing. And yeah... I still have no idea. I'm gonna have to... come back with some books. Good enough. Hey, look, I know this place has a certain... Character? Yeah, but it's been OK here for you guys? Nothing... Nothing weird's happened or anything? Define weird. Well, just things people have said since I moved out, that it's... I don't know, creepy. I wouldn't say that. We like creepy. I think every home has an echo of the people who lived there before. Yeah. I guess I never really thought of it like that. There's a good echo here. I, uh... How did she... If you don't mind my asking... Yeah, how did she die. We'd just moved in. And the electrical was all... well, you know... We watched, um... Marley & Me, but she made me turn it off when he had trouble getting up the stairs. We went up to bed. She had this thing where she would always get up to go to the bathroom the second she got into bed. And there was no light in the hall, and... she turned the wrong way. And... She went... down the stairs. Yeah, when she didn't come back to bed, I went to see if she was OK. Then I found her. Right there. I'm sorry. I can't imagine the shock. No, it's OK. Thanks. - What was she like? - No, it's OK. Ha! Sally? She was amazing! She was... She lit up the place, you know, everywhere she went! She was the best thing that ever happened to me. But that's for VH1 Behind the Music, right? Were you in a band or... I'm, uh, gonna come back for that sink. ♪ A hollow metal arrow ♪ ♪ Fell to the water ♪ ♪ It must have come down from the blast ♪ ♪ I gave it to you ♪ ♪ And I watched as my sand castle ♪ ♪ Slowly was turned into glass ♪ I think we should further explore what this is. I'm sorry? This. I believe Dean Kane called it "kismet." When? 90210... season 3... He said it to Shanon Doherty. Oh my God, I'm older than you! I don't think so. So, you live near that bar on Commonwealth, right? Yeah, me and Josh live around there. You know Josh. Oh, the orderly. Right. I think when we met, he curtsied. Did he? Yeah. Ah... You OK? Yeah, I've just been trying to quit smoking. One too many pieces of nicotine gum. Oh. But you can still drink, right? Because I was thinking that maybe we could go to that bar sometime after work. Cara, full disclosure. I'm not a lot of fun. Oh no, me neither. I'm, like, the opposite. OK, well, I got rounds. Sure. Great. Don't wanna keep the bedpans waiting! Unh! Ah! Rebecca? Did you just wet your pants? A little bit? People are worried you're dead. There's a search. Not a very good one. I'm here, geniuses. We should call someone. Sure, in a minute. We'll call everybody. Ah! I can't believe I didn't smell that stink a mile away! Are you a werewolf? Ah, gross! It's in my hair! You're a vampire? Oh, that's right. You live with Aidan. Twisted little halfway house you two are running. Aidan... Oh, there you go. The wheels click. You're a smart little doggie, aren't you? Yes, you are! Yes, you are! Aidan did this. Ooh... You look so surprised. I'd watch myself if I were you. Hey! Hey. What's wrong? You turned her into a vampire. - What? - Don't do that! Don't pretend like you don't know what I'm talking about! - Josh... - Rebecca. Just... Rebecca's dead. Oh! Oh... Is that right? I thought she was missing! She just jumped me outside. You had to turn Rebecca. - Josh... - Stop lying, Aidan! I swear I didn't know. You didn't know what? That you turned her into a monster or that she'd be such a good one? No, what's the point of any of this, of playing house, of... of drinking beers, of joining Costco if you're just gonna kill all our friends? Welcome to Sapp & Sons. May I help you plan a special goodbye for your friend or loved one? What did you do with her? You're gonna have to be more specific. I had a busy night. Where is she? Lunch break. I assume she's out catching a bite to eat. Boys, boys. You're both pretty. What did you do? I know life is long, but let's not waste our time with rhetorical questions. You asked for our help. I think we went above and beyond. I called for a cleanup. You had no right to turn her. Listen to yourself. So selfish. I asked you for a favour. Yes, you did, and it's not often that you ask. It's not often that you slip. So when you do, well, forgive us, but we just wanted to see for ourselves what was so special. She is quite a find. A little wild, though. But we'll forgive you that. Perhaps you can assist us in breaking her. Where is she? She seems to like the park. Shady trees, pretty flowers, happy people. Light breeze carrying the scent of fresh meat. We worked hard on her orientation, Aidan. Don't go putting silly ideas into her head. Come on. Hello? Guys? Hello? It's Danny! Are you OK? Are you? A friend said you had a condition. Hey, are you... Are you mad at me, Josh? What? No. Then why won't you talk to me? I told you something that I hadn't told anyone. Next thing I knew, you were gone. I'm so sorry. It's me, Josh. What is such a secret that you can't tell me? I saw it yesterday, didn't I? Or does it get worse? This was a mistake. I should leave you alone. No. No. We're here. We're talking. What did you say to Julia? Nothing. If you didn't wanna marry her and go to med school... No, no, Em, it wasn't... It wasn't that. Something happened to me. What? It's dangerous, Em. My life... Yes, it gets worse. It gets much, much worse. Look, Jackie and I are going home tomorrow. I'm not letting you leave us again. I almost killed you. I don't care. Let me help you, Josh. Please, come with us. What the hell am I doing? I don't know. Danny, seriously, call a plumber. I'm the one who fixed the toilet last time! That time you brought me breakfast in bed... the morning after you proposed... You got the tray all the way up the stairs and then you dropped everything when you got in the bedroom. You chipped the mug. Points for effort, though. Why do you always come to fix things by yourself? Is it me? Are you looking for me? 'Cause I might not be here forever. Or maybe I will. Maybe you'll get sick of playing plumber and you'll sell the place and marry and heiress and move to Connecticut, and I'll be stuck here haunting monsters. Danny! Danny! Do you even care? Oh my God! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Whoa! Whoa! What the hell? It just happened! I don't know! I just got upset. I'll fix it. I'll figure it out. I'll think happy thoughts. I better call a plumber. Know what'll make me happy? Tell Danny to stop ignoring me! Maybe we should just shut off the main line for now. Yeah, yeah, I'll get it on the way out. I'm really sorry. I'll send somebody over. Rebecca... You don't look nearly surprised enough to see a girl you left for dead. - I don't know where to begin. - Try. I've got an eternity. I didn't want this for you. - Better to kill me? - Rebecca. - You left me for dead! - Can we walk? I don't do this anymore. I got weak with you. And now I'm strong. You know how terrified I felt when I woke up in that room, their eyes on me? No idea what had happened, where you were, what you were. If I had any idea he'd do that to you... I get what came over you. I've got it. I wanna rip my skin off half the time. - I know. - But the other half... I feel like a goddess. So thanks for that. No. Thank Bishop. He's got a nice sales pitch. But once the high wears off, it is more gruesome than you could realize. We can go away together, you and me. Sure. Bed and breakfast upstate? We'll feed off the leaf peepers. I got you into this so I could teach you. Not sure I want advice from the man who fell off the wagon. But we can help each other stay strong. Please, I already know the best way to keep strong is to feed. What happened to you? Bishop told me you were the best. I was the worst. Well, how can you hate it so much? Nothing can kill you. That's not true. Practically nothing can kill you. The volume has been turned up in the world. I really hear what people say, how fast their hearts are beating. I can tell you what's for dinner 3 streets away. And my body... Yeah, it has its perks. But you have to remember who you were, who you loved. I was pathetic. I fell into bed with you after 2 glasses of wine and 20 minutes of swagger. To hell with who I loved. Dad never thought I'd amount to much. Wait till I grab him by the throat and eat his heart out. Listen to me very carefully. You do not wanna do that. You will never forgive yourself. All those years I spent being sorry? Think how sorry my sisters will be when I drain their babies lifeless. It'll be the best family meal we've had in years. Ha. What? Jealous? I'm sorry. I guess it takes that "He doesn't even know I'm alive" thing to a whole new level. Yeah. Maybe I'm not supposed to leave. OK. You saw it. Maybe he couldn't see me, but... he felt something. How could I not pursue that? Because... you're a monster. And he's not. And... Trust me... It ends bad. You know, I was engaged. You were? Yeah. I'll try not to take offence to your extreme shock. And she doesn't know? What would I say? I'm... I'm... What? It's a miracle I got her to love me once. You don't know how she'd react. Sally the Ghost. That's asking him to swallow a heck of a lot, don't you think? I've been dead for 6 months with no sign of change. If he gets scared... if my feelings get hurt, if a white light appears and I walk into it... what's the harm in trying? You really wanna go through the pain... of losing him all over again? I'm already dead. ♪ Bad luck, bad luck ♪ ♪ Came to me without warning ♪ ♪ Bad luck came with love ♪ ♪ From your flashing eye ♪ ♪ In the corners of the darkness ♪ ♪ Bad luck has lingered... ♪ Hello.

Come to the bar. I'm busy. Cara's here. So? So you should come. Why? Aidan, no. Just don't. Great. So you'll come then? Just... I'll be right there. Good. Who was that? Josh. He's coming over. - Oh... - OK, so, where were we? He asked you if you had anything in red. No, seriously. And, um, for those of you keeping track, that was the 4th pair of shoes! You tried on 4 pairs of shoes for a man with a shoe fetish? Or 6 pairs of shoes. Oh wow! OK! All right. Well, I gotta give you credit for staying with it. Oh, why... Why am I telling you this? Oh, well, that's my curse. Women like to tell me their most embarrassing stories. Well, you go. You owe me. I have nothing that bad. Sure you do. Shove over, babe. You shouldn't be here. Oh, hush! She's cute. What'd I miss? Mmm! Well? - I don't know. - Well, let's see. You told your sad little story, right? Now Aidan will tell you his, and you'll laugh and he'll say something self-deprecating. I don't wanna ruin it for you. Let's get on with it already. Am I right? You'll go back to your place. He's selfish that way. And then he'll give you some "blah-blah-blah" about Byron and his curse.

You never call. You really know how to mess with a girl's self-esteem. Ugh! I'm bored! Hey! Wanna get out of here? Uh, yeah. Fantastic. Bye-bye. - Wait. - Why? You want in? - You don't wanna do this. - I'm pretty sure I do. You go back to your friends. You have a drink. You forget about this one. Just go home! Yeah, OK, OK! Just came out of nowhere! Rebecca? Ah! Ah! Good doggie! Heel! Ahh! Cara. Hey, Cara. No, no, no, no, no! - There's too much blood. There's too much. - Well, someone had to do it, and you were taking your sweet-ass time. Mmm! I highly recommend a bar kill. She was sweet. A little oaky and cheap, but still... best Saturday night I've had in a long time. If we don't get help, she's gonna die. Oh, don't look so tragic. Give her a sip. She'll be fine. Is that true? Can you save her? - It won't be saving her. - Aw... That's right. You prefer to leave your conquests for dead. If you can save her... please... I can't! I'm sorry. So, this is it? It's over, isn't it? No. They'll trace Cara to Rebecca... and Rebecca to you. No. We're spread so far. Our networks run so deep.

But here and now... I choose them. I never really thought about it before, how hard he must work every single second of his life... not to be one of them.
