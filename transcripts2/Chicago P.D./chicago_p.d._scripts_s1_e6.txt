 You know, we were all just talking about you. Yeah? We didn't see your name on the reunion page on Facebook. Uh, yeah, you know, I saw that, but I have a thing that I have to get to, so... So are you working? What... what are you up to? Uh, I'm a cop. Seriously? Seriously, I'm a cop. I would've thought you'd be running from them. Nope. Well, come to the reunion. And don't worry... there are plenty of girls who are still single who rsvp'd.

 I think a big group of them are renting a stretch hummer or something. Oh, and, plus, you might meet someone. But, hey, if not, I understand. It's good seeing you. [Breathing heavily] I guess I got used to the dark. What time do you go on? [Breathing heavily] The graveyard. Well, it looks like you picked up some discipline inside, huh? Yep. Picked up a lot of things, pop. Justin, I know you're not loving this c.T.A. Gig, okay? It's only temporary. I just want to make sure you don't fall into bad habits, start running with a crowd that'll... I love you, dad. Is everything all right? What, I can't tell you that I love you sometimes? [Cell phone vibrating] Voight. All right, thanks, guys. - Don't tell me. - Yeah. Her name's Charlotte Matthews. Everything matches from the victim two days ago. - Commander. - Commander. - Raped? - Yeah. And ear was cut off? That's right. In New York six months ago similar to our two. We've been in contact with the detectives there. Now, there are 600 reasons why I didn't want you in charge of this unit, but there's one main reason why I did... cases like this. You understand me? I do. Let me talk to my partner, and I'll get back to you. All right, sergeant. Hey, you know the perp that raped and killed and cut the victim's ear off? He just struck again two hours ago in Chicago's riverwalk. Well, I sent them all the files from our case when their first one happened. I don't know what more we can do on our end. Not much. That's why we're heading to Chicago. . - What's up? - Morning, sarge. Erin, good morning. Have you noticed that platt, like, loves you for some reason? - Do you own a suit? - Yeah, why? You're going with me to my high-school reunion. Also, we're engaged. [Door buzzer sounds] W-wait. You're still here? Yeah. I plan on being here for a while. Yeah? Doing what, with whom? Look, Al... I'm telling you right now, man-to-man, I'm ready to do my job the right way, your way. Okay, so what do you say... new day, new beginnings, please? Look, I know I can be a little overzealous, all right? Growing up in the neighborhood I grew up in... I don't need your life story, man. I just need you to listen to me. Yeah. Yeah. Only when I think you're gonna make it here, and then you can tell me all about how daddy never bought you a skateboard. You speak Italian? [Speaking Italian] - Where'd you pick it up? - I was stationed in vicenza. You served? Yeah, a.B.C.T., part of a rapid response team. It's about an hour away from everyone. You? Rangers... Afghanistan. Well, that explains a lot. Were you ever injured in the line of crushing grapes? - Excuse me? - Was that in world war ii? - I can't hear you. What? - Oh, my God. These poor girls. Media's calling him "the riverwalk killer." Mayor's flipping out on the superintendent, who's flipping out on the chief. None of that matters to me. And were put through something so horrific... It ain't gonna happen again. There's no witnesses. Area central searched every crime scene and came up blank on physical evidence. - Pods? - Zero. Detectives from special victims unit in New York are en route right now to help out. They also had two victims killed in their city two days apart, "and traffic cameras picked up a male, white, 5'10" wearing a hoodie following both victims, but they couldn't get a clear visual on his face. What about registered sex offenders? Nothing pops. Plus, no DNA yet off any of the victims. Hey, we're not waiting around for that. We get proactive. Boots on the ground. I want everyone working the river looking for suspicious behavior. Dress the part. Burgess, I need a favor. We're gonna need someone to man the phones in intelligence. So there's gonna be a lot of calls coming in. Yeah, I'm all over it. Congratulations. You made secretary. Don't hate, appreciate. Well, there's some fresh slang. I'll be upstairs if you need me. [Panting] Oh, my God, whoever is panting in the mic, you're killing me right now. Bite me, ruzek. I've been running for an hour. Can I start calling you Hank or voight? No. Well, you know, I'm reading this book right now. It's called the magic of thinking big, wherein the author posits that titles, you know, they just cause this formal and unnecessary separation between people. Can we do any better on this image? I'm working on it. All right, everyone check the ramp. Eyes on a male... white, brown hoodie. In pursuit. Hey! Police! Let her go! Hold on! Ma'am, you okay? Don't move! I'm gonna crack you! You hear me? Give me your hand. [Groans] Offender in custody. . [Indistinct chatter] Theo Mitchell, and I don't think he's our guy. Found four wallets and three watches on him. He's a pickpocket, a purse-snatcher. Four arrests in the last ten years along those lines. No rape, no murder, not even a sexual assault. What? What do you think? Let's bring him in. Come on. Come on. Get in there. This is a rail road, man. Unbelievable. I would never hurt a woman, never. I'm inclined to believe you. Then what the hell am I doing here getting looked at for it? Riverwalk's your turf for pulling crimes, right? Looks like you've had pretty fertile grounds for a while. Oh, oh, okay, I get it. Threaten me with rape, murder, and then admitting to boosting some wallets seems tame by comparison. You know what? I'm out of here. No, you're not. Sizing people up and then ripping them off, I'm thinking maybe you could help us find who did rape and kill those two girls... Because my experience... a cheetah always knows where the hyena is. I like that analogy. You went jungle on me. Early this morning, before 6:00 A.M., around east lake... close your eyes and think. [Sighs] There was this dude... Like, 5:00 A.M... In running gear, but he was just stretching the whole time, just looking around. I remember thinking he was either a criminal or a cop, but I ain't ever seen a cop with a watch that nice, though. [Scoffs] How close did you get to him? Real close. I walked right by him. What's up, office? That's what you guys call each other out here, right... "office"? Sergeant platt. How can I help you? Yeah, we're here to see sergeant voight in intelligence. We have some information to share with him. Regarding? We're detectives from NYPD. Sergeant voight is expecting us. Oh, my God, you should have said you were from New York City. I'm mortified. Why don't you park it over there? Hey, office burgess, would you get your skinny ass down here? [Laughing] "Office." Hey, appreciate you coming. - Of course. - Hank voight. Hey, there. Rollins. Hi. - All right, how you doing? - How's it going? - Okay. - Jay. You guys are nice. What's up with that battle-ax downstairs? There isn't enough time in the day. Pleasure. Start off looking for patterns, obviously. Why New York and now Chicago? And this just happens to be his route? Maybe an interstate trucker? Yeah. The only commonality that we could find that might be worth pursuing, is there was a manufacturing trade show convention in New York at the time of our rape-murders. Now, that convention is now here in town at the rittenton center? - Rittenhouse, yeah. - Yeah. - Jin. - Yeah, on it. So who is this guy? I mean, what are we looking for? This perp has been elevated to serial-killer status. I mean, in terms of the rape and murder, there are five different profile psyches. I think we're looking at an anger retaliatory rapist. I mean, I get that he's a sadistic son of a bitch and everything, but is he trying to establish some sort of cred or...? Usually as a souvenir or a trophy. Sometimes they even make shrines. - [Groans] - Yuck. How long we have you guys for? As long as you need. Yo, our monitor works better if you don't slobber on it. Hey, how about that detective rollins? She's got, like, ten things going on, all of them good, am I right? Yeah. I give your marriage six months. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wendy and I... we're cool like that. And could tell her exactly what I just told you. - [Laughs] Yeah? - Yeah. You'd tell your fiance that you worked with a hot detective from New York that kind of blew your mind? No. - No. - No. - Come here. - All right. Okay, here's a list of attendees to both conferences, and I managed to put them through the dmv database and pull the photos. Jin, I don't need to hear about the labor. Just show me the baby. There. I got 45 guys who went to both conferences. All right. Wait. Hold up. Whoa, whoa. Don't touch the keys. No. No. Look, how many of these I got to look at? Don't worry about it. Just keep looking. I mean, like, 100 or 200, 'cause... whoa, whoa, whoa. That's the dude. I swear to God. Fyi, you're not just my fiance. You're my fiance that got in early at Facebook, like, way early. You're worth at least $10 million. Well, how about I get a perm and I wear a hoodie, and you can just tell everybody I'm mark zuckerberg? The reason I don't wear a ring... why can't I be a cop? - What does your suit look like? - Like a suit. It has to look high end. I have nice suits. [Door opens, indistinct chatter] There. - Jeffrey Baker? - Yes? Detectives Lindsay and halstead, Chicago p.D. Apparently, there's been some damage to your hotel room. Would you mind coming with us to talk about it? I didn't do any damage to my hotel room. Great. You can clear all that up down at the district. After you. So how long have you been in town? Five days. Mm. From St. Louis? You been to the riverwalk at all, Jeffrey? What does that have to do with my hotel room? I'll ask you, again. You been to the riverwalk? I have. When? [Chuckles] Forgive me, but I get the sneaking suspicion that I'm not here about a hotel room. Well, why else would we bring you in? I haven't the foggiest. Mm. Oh, would you like some water? What days and times were you at the riverwalk? Do you get the Internet here? 'Cause there's this great video on YouTube by this law-school Professor, and he's very articulate, and he makes a very compelling and convincing argument. It's called "don't talk to cops." No offense. [Chuckles] You're not in St. Louis, Jeffrey. We've had two rape-murders here in the last few days where the women were mutilated. Now, you're gonna answer some questions about that. Wipe that stupid smile off your face. I will remove the smile, as requested, and tell you very seriously that you have the wrong guy. We want the dates and times you were at the riverwalk. Get writing. There's been another rape down at the riverwalk. Victim survived. She's at Chicago med. . Hi, Vanessa. Ma'am. I'm detective Lindsay, and this is detective Dawson, and we're here to try to... I'll do whatever I can to help you catch him. All right. Thank you. Can you take us through what happened? I'm on the soccer team at school, so I like to get a run in after practice, and I cut through riverwalk the way I do every day, and out of nowhere, this guy appears in a brown hoodie with a mask on. Did he say anything? Just to shut up and not scream. He put a hand over my mouth, and he dragged me to, like, this dark area underneath the stairs. And then he yanked my sweats and underwear down, and that's when... That... that's when he did it. Okay. Is there anything that you could see on him... scars, a birthmark? No. What about height and weight? He was about you're height, maybe a little heavier than you. He had brown eyes, and I saw some of his hair. It was dirty blonde. Well, that's great. That's a lot more than we had. Is there anything else that you saw that could help us identify him? When he took his knife out... Something kicked in. We just had this self-defense class at school, and the instructor lady said that if you don't remember anything else, you should slap, grab, twist, and pull. And that's what I did. Good. I'm glad you did. Now, when that happened, were you able to scratch his face or...? It got my thumbnail inside his eye, his right eye... Deep. He screamed, and he fell off of me, and... And that's when I ran. You have been amazing. He didn't break me. I want him to know that. He will. The guy we brought in, Jeffrey Baker... what eye color does he have? Blue. Plus, he was in our custody when this rape happened. All right, kick him. Blonde hair, brown eyes, possible damage to the eye. Check all clinics, hospitals, see if anybody came in for an eye injury. I'll get it out to all vehicle and foot patrol. [Sighs] You all right? She's only 16. Let's get him. Hey, I have to head out, but if anyone asks, I'm on official business. Wait. Sorry. Can you repeat that? Yes, I have to go, but it's official business, just in case anyone asks. Hold on. I got to write this down, or I'm gonna forget it. - Okay, officer burgess... - Yeah. Has to go, but in case anyone asks... oh, that's right. Nobody cares. Okay. Okay, so, if the perp was rational, I mean, he'd leave town knowing that the heat is on, but there's a good chance he's not, so most likely he's angrier. He's more fixated because his needs went unmet. He probably has a good idea that he left DNA under the victim's fingernails, and it's only a matter of time before he gets I.D.'D, so he's gonna need to strike soon while he has a chance. All right, hospitals and clinics, check with foot patrol down at riverwalk. Beat the bushes on this guy. Hey, where's burgess? I haven't seen her. - Whoa. - Oh, sorry. My bad. Hmm. Oh, yeah, that confirms it. Chicago cops cannot make a good cup of coffee either. [Both chuckle] Here. Thanks for helping us work this case. Of course. They're tough... Especially when the victims are kids, but, you know, at least Vanessa's alive. It just doesn't make any sense. So you want the good guys to win. I want the bad guys to get what's coming to them. Well, sometimes they do. Do you believe in karma? I believe in payback. Just a little unsolicited advice, just because I've been there... be careful 'cause payback is the biggest bitch when it consumes you. Here, put that in there. [Knock at door] Where you been? Well, I called all the pharmacies within a two-mile radius of the attempted rape asking if any male with blonde hair and brown eyes came in with an apparent eye injury. The walgreen's over on superior said a guy matched that description, bought gauze, peroxide, sunglasses. They needed to see a badge, that's why I had to go down there. What do you got? He used a credit card... Neil vance. Jin pulled his credit card history. He's been staying at the hotel fauntleroy the past six days. He also has hotel charges in New York at the same time of the rape-murders that happened there. Team effort. But, uh, really, more her. You're going places, kid. Halstead and Lindsay. Parked, we got eyes in the back. O and ruzek? Lobby. Vance is not in his room. Stay put. Mackinac island. - What? - That's where we met. I was at a leadership conference, and you were picking out property for a summer retreat. Of course I was. It all went down at the grand hotel... fireworks, candlelight. This is good. This tells me a lot about you. I am adding color to our story. It's just like undercover. The details sell it. Yeah, just like going undercover. What? - It's ridiculous. - [Scoffs] You have no idea what kind of bitches these girls can be. [Indistinct chatter] Quit acting like a cop. Just for the record, my dad... he did buy me a skateboard. Santa Cruz, black deck, silver trucks, orange wheels. I can still do a nosegrind down a handrail, baby. True story. I'm not a robot, Alvin. Love me or leave me, man. Love me, Al. You're a pisser, man. I swear to God. Pisser... I like that. Hey, that guy that we, uh, brought in from the convention center and kicked. Yeah, Jeffrey Baker. - What hotel is he staying at? - Sofitel. He just walked in. He's talking to the desk clerk. [Walkie-talkie beeps] Jeffrey Baker just walked into the lobby. [Walkie-talkie beeps] Take him. The guy that just came up here and talked to you... [Elevator bell dings] Suspect's exiting through the front door. [Engine turning over] [Tires squealing] [Car horn blares] [Tires screeching] [Car door closes] What are you doing here, Jeffrey? I'm just out for a stroll. Put your hands up. Clerk said he was asking what room Neil vance was staying in. Where's vance? I want a lawyer. . Some deviant chat room most likely. Baker travels for his conventions. Maybe vance meets him there. Baker's the lookout while vance does the crime. It's a dyad. Both partners plan and commit the crime together, but there is usually a dominant-submissive relationship. Like the columbine killers, the D.C. snipers, the menendez brothers, those two yahoos who blew up the Boston marathon. Yeah, the dominant force is psychopathic and/or sadistic. The submissive partner is depressed. He's dependent. The leader is gonna be charismatic, he's looking for a follower to manipulate, while the subordinate... he's vulnerable. He feels lost. He needs someone to lead him. Baker's the dominant, guaranteed. - Where's Baker right now? - He's in the interview room. He's all lawyered up. Not for long. Put him in the cage. Yes, sergeant. What's the cage? With some pretty sharp detectives from New York. I think we got you figured out. You don't say. You pull the strings. Neil vance does the dirty work. I have no idea what you're talking about. Take a walk. Take a walk. I like that face. Where's vance? Which I've been attempting to exercise repeated... ah! Ugh! I can't begin to try to understand what goes through someone's head who would rape and murder a woman, so I got to ask you, why cut off the ear? Can you explain that to me? No, because I have no idea... you both get your rocks off on it, right? Probably have him explain to you in detail what it was like, what she went through. Instead of hearing about it... How about I show you firsthand? Get away from me. I have rights. I have rights! You have me... You sick... - Where's vance? - No! No, you can't do this! Ah! [Crying] Wait a sec. That's the wrong ear. You have vance cut off the right one, correct? I haven't done anything! You tell me where vance is right now, or they're gonna carry you out of here in sandwich bags. You hear? Navy pier! I'm supposed to meet him in a half an hour at Navy pier. [Groans] [Door opens, closes] Spread out. Come on. Yeah, hi. How are you? Okay. I got the eye. Ruzek? Where are you? C.P.D.! Out of the way! [Woman screams] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, now. I'll kill her! . Drop the gun on the ground and kick it to me! All right. I'm not gonna give you a loaded gun, but you knew that, right? Where are you, ruzek? What's your endgame here, brother? You got no way out. Why don't you let her go? Come with me. - No! - We have Jeffrey. He gave you up. I mean, how do you think we found you? What are you gonna do? You gonna jump on a boat? I mean, you haven't hurt her yet. We can still work this out. Shut up! Don't do this. You got a backup gun! I know it! Give it to me! See, you're smart, Neil. You're smart. Not even my partner, marlyn, knows about the backup. Ruzek's at the marlyn yacht. Everybody move in. Listen, I'm gonna make a deal with you, okay? You let her go, I let you go. Right now I just want the girl safe. Call s.W.A.T. In? No, there's no time for that. Halstead and olinsky, move into position. We're backing out of here. The moment I see someone flash metal at me, none of that needs to happen, all right? We're not going there. [Walkie-talkie beeps] You got the shot? - Affirmative. - Light him up. [Gunshot] - Aah! Hey, don't look at him. Come here. Come with me. - Hey, what's your name? - Kate. Kate, I'm Adam. Let's sit you down right here, okay? - You all right? - Yeah. It's okay. - This is detective Lindsay. - Hi. I just want you to calm down. She's gonna ask you a couple of questions. Do you have any family we can call? Yeah. It's in my cell phone. Okay, we'll get it. We'll get everybody here, and we'll get you to the hospital. [Distant sirens wailing] You saw some action when you were stationed in Italy I take it? A little, yeah. We got him. [Sobbing] You have fun answering phones up there today? Have a good night, sergeant. All right, there you go... - macallan on the rocks. - Thanks. Where you two from, again? Cops from N.Y.C. Well, you know, even though firefighters own this place, quit beating around the bush and give me something here. - It's classified. - It's classified. - It's classified. - You got to be kidding me. You see what I deal with every day? Where's voight? Voight? Voight doesn't come to this bar. - Why not? - It's a long story. - Classified. - It's classified, yeah. [Laughter] Well said. You did good. I'll take that. You did good. You did good. I'll take that, man. I'll take that. You know what? Everybody did. Really. Cheers. Hey, one second. Hey, burgess? Come here. Antonio wanted to make sure we took care of you tonight. - Saddle up. - Thanks. To the blue. All: To the blue. Cheers. And, of course, now it's raining. Hold on. The ring... you never talked about the ring. Why don't you wear it? I'll wing it. I'm not gonna be able to keep this stuff straight. Did we meet before or after I got stupid rich on Facebook? [Women screaming excitedly] What am I doing here? So, like you saw in the file, I had been voight's c.I., so he knew me, and when I was 16, him and his wife took me in. They saved me. And then he pulled some strings and got me into St. ignatius, and when I got there, I just made up who I was... voight's goddaughter staying with him while my parents were traveling. So you've always been good at undercover? [Laughs] If you mean lying, yeah. I was a street kid. [Laughs] So Steph and her crew pulled me into their clique, and pretty soon we were doing everything together... shopping, parties, and... All of it. [Sighs] And then somebody found out who I really was. You figure out who your real friends are pretty quick when the word's out that your mom's a junkie and your dad's in jail. Whose ass did you kick first? [Chuckles] Voight had to make a deal with the director of the school to get me in. If I got in a fight and threw even one punch, I was out. So I ate it. And it still bothers me. I don't know why. Even after days like today, when you would think everything would be put in perspective... I don't know. We can't. Come on, let's get you home. [Sighs] Maybe one day. Oh, definitely. Hey, Justin, it's me again. Wondering if you want to catch a late bite. All right, give me a call. [Knock at door] [Chuckles] - Hey. - Hey. [Breathing heavily] - Are you okay? - Um... What's wrong? I just, um... I just, um... I didn't want to do it, you know? I just... I had to. Justin? What the hell did you do? [Breathing heavily]
