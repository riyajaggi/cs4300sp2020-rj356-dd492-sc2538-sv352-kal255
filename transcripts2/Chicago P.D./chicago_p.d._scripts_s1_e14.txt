 Hey. He's gonna be okay. All right? Thank you. Look. Mrs. Dawson. Is he gonna be all right? We're gonna monitor him closely, but he may need a second surgery. He's not outta the woods yet. Can I see him? Of course. Right here. Antonio. Hey, baby. Hi, honey. Hey, big guy. Hey. Belden? Gone.

 Those guards? Both dead. (ANTONIO SIGHS) Find him. We will. Dad's gonna live, right? Oh! He's gonna be okay. Absolutely. He's gonna be fine. You know, when I was your age, my father was in this very same hospital. Your dad is one of the toughest cops I know. He's gonna walk out of here stronger than ever. Listen. You two stay here with Laura and the kids. They don't leave your sight. You hear me? Yes, sir. Sarge, no disrespect. I'd rather be out there hunting down Pulpo. What is more important than protecting Antonio and his family? (SIGHS) Are you lost? Last time I checked this was your boss's desk. I'm installing new incident reporting software in all the Intelligence computers. Well when you're finished here, will you come down and fix mine? It froze up. Of course. Yeah. I'll be right down. Erin? Hey. Oh, Annie. Good to see you. You, too. Um, I'm sorry. One of my partners got shot. And I've been at the hospital. And I should've texted you. Oh no. It's all right. Um, am I in trouble? No. No, no, no. Not at all. Hey bud. You gonna come say hi to me? Hey Erin. What? What is going on with you? Are you sprouting? When did you get so tall? (LAUGHS) Can you give me and your mom a minute? Okay. Listen, um, I'm sorry I made you come all the way here. I just wanted to tell you in person. Charlie's back. Why's he back? I don't know, but he asked about you. Did you tell him? About Travis? Of course not. But he's here, so how do you want to play this? I can tell him to leave you alone, or I can give him your phone number. Or I can pick a place for all of us to meet and I can be there. Yeah. I want you to be there. Okay. Okay. I'll set it up. Thanks. Listen up. What Pulpo did downstairs was an attack on our family. First Willhite, and now Antonio. So let me be clear. Forget warrants. Forget the rules. It's on us to catch him. And when we do, he's to be handed off to me and Alvin. (DOOR OPENING) They found a possible getaway vehicle up on Division. Any sign of Pulpo? One dead male, no confirmation on the body yet. All right, let's go. Hey, Sarge? I'm just looking for a little clarification on what you just said. Pulpo ain't making it back to a jail cell. That clear enough for you? Thanks. So what do you got? All fake. They took a regular van and put the decals on it so it looks like a paddy wagon. The prison transport van that Pulpo escaped in was found six blocks from the district. He ditched it and he switched to this. All right. Where's the body? Over here. Driver's wearing a mall security badge someone bought at an army surplus store. Forensics ID'd the prints. His name's Carlos Guevera. He's a known bagman for the Colombian cartel. Pulpo couldn't let that guy live to talk. Hey guys, Pulpo's girlfriend and son were with him. How much you wanna bet he's taking his family unit and hightailing it back to Colombia? We got his name, his mug shot at every border checkpoint, train stations, airports. If Pulpo planned this far, you better believe he planned for a way to get out. What do you have for me? Yeah. I was able to download all his reports and emails. Do you think that Voight is gonna leave any real dirt on his computer under a file labeled, "Corruption"? Jin, I need a wire on his Nextel, his personal phone, and inside his car. Listen, (STUTTERING) I'm planning on ramping up surveillance on him, soon. Planning on it? If you don't give me something that I can use by next week, I'm going to make sure that your father gets a visit from the F.B.I. I think you understand why... Absolutely. Halstead, I agree with you. So, we're all willing to just go off book for Voight? Look, I'm four months out of the Academy, man. I just do what I'm told. Even if that means being part of a lynch mob? If you're asking if I'm gonna turn over my shield in protest? No. I'm not. Are you? I mean... What I'm saying is, "What do we do?" If we find Pulpo, are we just gonna turn him over to Voight? All right. Everybody relax. What we do is find Pulpo and then we can figure it out. Yeah. That's exactly what we need. Yeah. Hey. Great. Anything on Lina's house? Marshals stormed it. Came up empty. All right. What about Lina's family? Her mom's got a place on the south side, came up clean, and so did her cell phone records. But I think it's worth a drive-by. Good. Take Sumner. Go do it. So, last guy loyal to him, he kills. No friends, no family. Who else do you have? What about Pulpo's lawyer? Anthony Timpone? Timpone. He reps half the criminals in the city. He didn't get that rep by cooperating with the police, I'll tell you that. I got an idea. When my parents got divorced, my ma had this guy call in a threat to my dad's office. He was checking for bombs underneath his car for months. Sergeant? (SIGHS) Hey. You got a Spanish speaker on shift? Hey, Garcia. Play pass-the-bum to Andrews and get your ass over here. What's up? Hey man. I need you to, uh, call in a death threat. All right? Come on. You never know when, it's your time to shine. Go. (SPEAKING SPANISH) That convincing enough? I bought it. Hey, wait. Easy. Easy. C.P. D, big guy. All right? Wait. Wait! You can't go in there! What the hell? Ooh. What's with the hardware, Timpone? I have a permit. We're looking for Pulpo. Yeah apparently he's looking for me. I just got a call from him. Hmm. What do you make of that? A call from Pulpo? That ain't good. They don't come cheap. So what happened? Pulpo spend his last chunk of change on you, got life, and now he wants a refund? Yeah. That's why I got him. You think that you and some rent-a-cop are gonna keep him from getting in here if he really wanted to? Mmm-mmm. I've arrested a lot of scumbags, you've put back out on the street. So I gotta be honest with you. I don't give a damn what happens to you, but if you got anything that can help me find Pulpo, it might be good for both of us. During Pulpo's trial, he asked where he could buy sets of new identities. Top-of-the-line papers. So, I referred him to an old client of mine. What's his name? Neil Bunker. He's a Notary Public. He's got a camera joint on North Clark. Bunker's been arrested for everything from bogus passport to counterfeit Bulls tickets. So, let's see if Pulpo's left any breadcrumbs. Hey there. Welcome. Officers, how can I help you? Recognize him? Nah. You sure? Mmm-hmm. Don't worry about him. We heard if someone's looking for clean ID's and credit cards they come to you. You want to get some pictures developed, great. But, otherwise... You sure you don't recognize him? No. No? No. What kinda shop is this? It's just a photo shop. It's what we do. Photos. Bring him back here. So, what is this little operation? Oh, I... No, I... It's... Looks like somebody got a haircut. (BEEPING) Got Pulpo. Okay. (SIGHS) Let's start over. Where's Pulpo? I know who he is. I'm not having him coming after me. You're gonna have to arrest me. Who said anything about arrest? I mean, all I know is you... You took a shot at a police officer. What? Pick it up. Pick it up. Go ahead. Pick it up. Don't look at me. Listen, you have two choices. You can shoot your way out of here, or you can tell me about Pulpo. All right. I made... I made him 3 sets of ID's and a couple of credit cards to match. Was he was with a woman and a kid? Yes. And you have no idea where they're going? No. Of course not. No, I swear. (SIGHS) Hey. Take him in. Book him. Get up. Aiding and abetting. (STUTTERING) Yeah, but I talked. Not fast enough. Anything off the PODs? No. But I've got every electric eye in the city wide open. What about the Sumner thing? What about it? I told you to look into it. You getting stupid on me? Um, no, no. Uh, yeah. Here. I pulled all her calls in the last week. Any with Internal Affairs? Uh, I think she made three calls over there to a Edwin Stillwell. I don't know what they were about, though. I mean she might have a case pending. Where's Burgess? Went to the bathroom. Fixing her make-up, huh? Maybe. How's he doing? Resting. He's a fighter. Combos. Hi. And thanks so much. The kids love those. No biggie. How you doin'? Hanging in there. Good. Thanks. You know... (CLEARS THROAT) I've known your dad a long time. We were in the same patrol unit, back when he was a rookie. When we went on this call one time, chased this dealer into a crack house. He shot at us through the door with a 12-gauge. I got hit in the hip and went down. And this bad guy, he would've finished me off, but your dad, he ran over and picked me up. He carried you? He did. I was a little thinner, back then. So they plucked the buckshot out of me and they stuck me behind a desk. But if it wasn't for your dad... (SIGHS) Uh-huh. All right. Keep us posted. Thanks. Anything on Lina's mom's house? No. Zip. But I've got a couple undercovers parked down the street. (SIGHS) At, uh, the hospital. I've never heard Voight talk about his father. What's the whole story? Nothing you can't find in the Sun-Times archives. You lived with him. Look, all I know is that every time a cop gets shot in this city, Voight gets that same look in his eye. (CELL PHONE BEEPS) I need some air. Must feel strange going to a police station every day, voluntarily. I gotta make this quick. Hey, whatever happened to Voight? Let me guess, dead or in jail. Actually he's my boss. Your boss? (SMIRKS) Up in here? That's right. (CHUCKLES) Classic. That's classic. Okay, well you can tell him to leave me alone. Tell him I got flushed down the toilet so you could play cop. Ring a bell? You don't even know. Listen, you got a son, Charlie. With Annie. His name's Travis and he was born six months after you left. What? How come no one told me? No one could get a hold of you. I'm gonna set up a time for us all to meet. I'll be in touch. Hey. Oh. Okay. We've got a hit. Lina's fake ID, Maria Esposito was just used along with her fake credit card to rent a vehicle from Midway 20 minutes ago. You got eyes on 'em? Even better. It's got a GPS tracker on it. I got its exact location, heading north on Pulaski. Beautiful. Uh, Sumner, you're out. Oh. Okay, I'll stay back and watch... No, you're out of my unit. You're transferred. As of tomorrow, you work in Narcotics. You can't transfer me. Already made the call. You're making a mistake. My mistake was letting you stay around this long. You got the day to pack your desk and pass off your files. Where is he? Five blocks up ahead, still going northbound. (TIRES SCREECHING) (ENGINE REVVING) I don't see an SUV. Hold up, they just pulled off. (RADIO BEEP) We got a visual. No sirens. OLINSKY: A lot of people here. Get in your car. Get in your car. Get down! Get down! HALSTEAD: Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Stay in your car. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go. Go. Go. No driver! I can't see and I can't clear this! Ready? Put your hands up. Get 'em up! Up! Put your hands up. (GASPS) Get away from the door. Put 'em on your head. Come over here. He's not in there. Where's Pulpo? Where's Pulpo? So how did you think this was work out, Lina? You guys were gonna leave and just be a big, happy family in South America? I want to see my son. You tell us where Pulpo's headed, you can see him. (SIGHS) Adres told me to rent a truck, and then pick him up at a taqueria at Fifth and Pulaski, off the highway at 5:00. Anything else? (SIGHS) He said if anything changed, he'd call me. This throwaway phone we found on her has zero calls. Pulpo ain't gonna be at Fifth and Pulaski. He used her and the kid as a diversion. He wanted her to get caught to throw us off the scent. Hey, just hand her over to Major Crimes and notify Child Services on her kid. Let's go. Everyone go back and check every scrap of paper we have on Pulpo. I don't care if it's a jailhouse lunch wrapper he left in the cage. Every known associate, rival, anything you can find. I'm sorry things didn't work out. (SIGHS) I didn't get a chance to look at them, considering... Catch this guy. For Antonio. Hey, Atwater. I just got a text from Ruzek. You gotta hot date? No. Voight gave Sumner the boot. Damn. They're gonna need to replace her. True. Let's agree that we both deserve that spot. Yeah. Yeah. Hey guys, check this out. It's a Motion for Assets petition filed on behalf of Adres Dias. Someone tried to bond Pulpo out. His bond was set at a million dollars. He never made bail. Yeah. But somebody tried. Stepan Nestrov put his nightclub up as an asset, but it wasn't worth enough. Nestrov? A Russian. Come here. Nestrov is part of the Elston Avenue crew. Fresh off the boat Russians shipped over to do dirty work for the old timers, but they decided to break off on their own. Yeah. And the Russians hate the Colombians. All right. Then why'd they try to bond Pulpo out? Just get the address of that club. Police! Hands up! Everybody, hands in the air! Hands in the air. Put your hands behind your head! (GUN FIRING) Back up. Now. Don't look at me. Get on the floor. Get on the ground. Get down. Turn around! Get on the ground. Get down. You, too. Down on the ground. Spread your legs open. 50-21 emergency, shots fired at police. MAN: (GRUNTS) Suspect's gonna need an ambulance. Back's clear. I see a lot more cocaine. No Pulpo. Put your arms out. Spread 'em out. Spread 'em out. Spread your legs. So why would you put up your nightclub to bond out a Colombian drug lord who's wanted for murder? Huh? Somebody dating somebody's sister? They pay me for your sister, sucker. What was that? Hey, you guys. This laptop you confiscated from his club? I cracked the password, but I can't read any of the emails. They're all in Cyrillic. It's gonna take me forever to translate this. Great. I don't suppose we have a cop on shift that reads Russian, too? I know a guy. So, it looks like most of these are back and forth to his girlfriend in Moscow. Uh, wait. Here's one about a shipment on Aeroflot. What's that? It's a Russian airline. Do you think it's about shipping coke? I don't know. There's an attachment, though. Um, it's for a transport trailer. Well, you don't need a transport trailer to move a couple of gym bags of coke. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. But you do need one for SUVs. This is a bill of lading listing two vehicles being shipped on an Aeroflot cargo plane from O'Hare to Moscow. (GRUNTS) Come on in, Brian. It's all right. Come on. Ask him, what's he doing with Pulpo? (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Tell him... Tell him if he talks, I'll charge one of his boys down in the cage with the cocaine and he walks. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Hmm? He asks if you're serious? He knows my reputation from the street. I keep my word. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) He says the Octopus fronted them a million dollars in cocaine. That's why he's helping him. He owes him. Is Pulpo in that container? (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Yes. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) It leaves at 3:00. That's in two hours. Thanks. What's the problem? Just follow us. Be cool. Come on down. Take him outside and stay there. Ready? Let's go. (COUGHS) (ALARM BEEPING) Hey, Pulpo. Remember me? (GRUNTS) No! No! Now you can take off. Now. Well that's that, then. Go get the driver. Yeah. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Come on, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. I can give you the Russians. I can give you the Mexicans. Come on, man. I don't care. Come on, man. Just arrest me, man! Come on! (MUFFLED) This is insane, man. (GRUNTS) (GROANING) (MUFFLED YELLING) Lt'll be dark in an hour. How you doing? I'm dying of thirst. Mmm. Hey. We got him. I didn't see it on the news. I'm not sure you will. Oh. Come here. The guy who killed Olinsky's partner, Browning. Supposedly, they took him to the docks on River Road. And did what? Took him for a boat ride. Jay, I want Pulpo punished for what he did. But I don't want that on my conscience. Do you? Feels like deja vu. You know, a little, yeah. (SIGHS) You know I was never sure if, um, you... You killed Browning because of Eddie, or because you were trying to make up for your father. He murdered our partner. Yeah. What happened to my father had nothing to do with it. Browning. He ever keep you awake at night? Sleep like a baby. (SIGHS) Well, I haven't slept right in 20 years. That's not 'cause we killed Browning. That's 'cause he killed your partner and you weren't there to stop it. (SIGHS) Yep. (SIGHS) All right, so, have we learned anything? He's gonna die in prison. We're just speeding up the process. (LAUGHS) Come on. It's time. (SIGHS) (GROANING) (MUFFLED SCREAMING) (MUFFLED SCREAMING) Get up. (GRUNTS) I got it. Shut up. You ever go swimming with a Chicago necklace? (GROANING) (MUFFLED) No! (MUFFLED) No! No! No! (MUFFLED SCREAMING) You can't do this. You went to see Antonio. What Antonio wants and what Pulpo deserves are two different things. We need to turn him in. He dies right here, right now. (GROANING) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait a second. Wait a second. The kid's right, man. We got him. We won. Alvin. Nah, not now. Not tonight. Not tonight. (GROANING) (GRUNTS) You got him? I got him, Detective. Come on. All right, these are all the files right here. Thanks. (ENGINE STARTING) Hey, Sarge. You wanted to see us? Yeah. You may have heard we have a spot open. Yes sir. You might want to fill it right away. Congratulations, Atwater. You just made Intelligence. Uh, thank you, sir. I appreciate that. All right. You start tomorrow. Congrats, Kevin. Thank you. Would you give me a sec? No doubt. Sir? Can I ask why? You didn't make the cut? You're good police, Burgess. I just don't tolerate in-house romance. Especially from a uniform who should be doing everything she can to prove she's fully committed to the job. No, it's... Dismissed. Thank you, sir. Get the door. Hey, hey. Is everything all right? What happened? Hey. Hey. May I come in? Yeah. It's been awhile since I've been in here. You know, everything that happened to Antonio, made me start thinking a lot about Eddie. After he was killed, I put a lot of distance between me and you. Alvin, are you okay? I want to make things right between us. Al... Hey. Come here. (SOBBING) You're late. I got caught up with something. And what is that? I thought it'd be nice. For a five-year-old, Travis is 12. And I told you, you can't just invoke your father-son privileges already. Hey T, I want you to meet somebody. This is Charlie. Me, and him, and your mom, we all grew up together. We're old friends. Pleasure to meet you, Travis. You a Bears fan? Yeah. Who's your favorite player? Urlacher. Oh. That's a good choice. I'm old school. Can't beat Singletary. Your mom still a Packers fan? Don't remind me. (CHARLIE LAUGHS) Tell me about it. All right. Well, I just wanted to stop by and say hey. It's been awhile. Glad that you did, Charlie. You got a sec? Yeah. I'll be right back. (SIGHS) Erin? Erin, yes or no? Do you owe me? Are you kidding? Do you have something cooking already? Don't blow this, Charlie. Yes or no? Do you owe me? Yeah, sure. Good answer. Hey. Give me another Manhattan. Sure. Whatever he's having. Two of those. You got it. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) You're gonna hear me out first. I deal with things in the moment. I make the best decision I can. Sometimes I'm right. Sometimes I'm wrong. And I accept that. I move forward, knowing I did the best I can to protect this city. I have my convictions. And I don't give a damn what anybody thinks. You have yours as well, Jay. I know that. And I respect that. (SIGHS) Cheers. Ripped By mstoll (THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
