 I've figured out a way to make you worth my time. Twenty five percent. Everything that you take off the street. It doesn't look like I have a choice. Ripped By mstoll We got him.

 Can I ask why? You didn't make the cut? I just don't tolerate in-house romance. Listen, you got a son, Charlie. With Annie. The deal was I take you in, he stays out of Illinois. I will handle it. CHARLIE: I got flushed down the toilet so you could play cop. You owe me. Sure. Good answer. (CHILD SCREAMS) CHARLIE: You had every opportunity to reach out to me. Every opportunity. I didn't know. You shut me out! Enough! Erin! CHARLIE: She's fine! She's fine.

 Are you okay? Yeah. You're gonna wish you stayed out of Chicago, Charlie. No, what you're gonna wish is that I'd forgotten all about Sandoval. But I haven't. Have I? You wanna take me in? Lets go. I'm happy to tell everyone what happened. Not five streets from here if I recall. Or, hey, I got an idea. Instead of the past, why don't we focus on the future. Sure. What do you want? How much? More than you can afford on a cop's salary. I'm gonna need the old Lindsay for this one. (CHUCKLES) (SCOFFS) You're out of your mind. Really? You know, I played nice guy before, and kept my mouth shut for you two. And what did it get me? Twelve years wandering the wilderness while you got to play cop, and you raised my son. Don't touch her! Nah! Not this time. I'm getting my payday. Or I run my mouth. I need that today. (DOOR CLOSES) Please, Erin. Annie. Erin, please, whatever he needs... (WHIMPERS) Just... Just give it to him. Hank. You get paid when I get paid. I'm supposed to wait around, take your word for it. That's right. If you try and screw me... You already told me already. You got bear traps set up. Well so do I. What it called? Mutually assured destruction? How about we avoid all that, you just relax and wait for your cut. (SIRENS WAILING) Yeah. Uh-huh. Hey.

I'm not gonna argue with you about this. All right. They had a plan. They took out all the security cameras in the area. Jin checked the pods. There's nothing there. They're missing 100 pounds of aluminized water gel explosives. Water gels? It's for mining and tunneling. Companies use it for blasting bedrock. Yeah. That's a lot of explosives. Like take down a building big. VOIGHT: We've had enough of that around here. We're also missing a security guard, boss.

It's in the budget. It all about who you can trust, Antonio. What do you got? I'm waiting on a list of employees from that construction site. So far no one's popped. Now you said they didn't get any blasting caps or detonation cords? No. You're gonna need those. All right. Det cords and caps, thats our angle for now. I got a CI I can talk to about that. All right. Uh, Sarge? Yeah? You know, I grew up in Harvey right there near the construction site. It Two-Eights territory. Nothing goes down there without their permission. I know a guy. I think I could lean on him a little bit, see what he knows. Olinsky. Go with him. Actually, I think I'm gonna do this by myself, O. Oh hey, everyone, Atwater's been in the unit two minutes and already he's put himself in charge. (APPLAUDING) RUZEK: Hey. HALSTEAD: Congrats, bud. I knew you were management material. Oh, no, no, that not what I was trying to say. What were you saying? It's just... You're worried about your white cop partner blowing the deal? Yeah.

Got you some fries. Hey, listen. Can you tell me anything about this construction site robbery in Harvey? Might be tapped in on that. Yeah? My ears, man. They get so waxy these days. Oh, yeah, so waxy these days. Yeah? His ears. Yeah. Yeah. Ding ding. Clear as a bell just like that. Just like that? HALSTEAD: Yeah. There lots of talk. There this new player in town. He was, uh, looking for some bangers. I'm kind of serving as a consultant. Can you get us a meeting? Tell them we're offering blasting caps and det cord. What, straight up? Yeah. Straight up. All you're doing is organizing a meet. All right. Drive toward Erie and Sedgwick. Right on, man. MOUSE: I'll set it up. Oh. Commander At-At. What good, son? Straight and narrow. You know me. Yeah, well, you always were. You always were. GRESHAWN: So what's up, man? If only you could shoot free throws straighter. Come on, man. I kept people out of the paint, didn't I? Nobody told me I had to score too. (LAUGHS) True. What up, man? Where the uniform at? I'm on to bigger and better things now. Special unit. Yeah? Yeah. Look at you. Look at you. You know it. So what's up, man? You know I got the hook up over there at the convention center. I can get you and the crew wholesale electronics right after the big CE show. I'm talking about Wiis, Playstations, anything you like, all on the up and up. Yeah? I'm listening. What up? I just need you to introduce me to Copeland Briggs. (CHUCKLING) No way, man. Come on, dog. You're like my brother, man. Oh yeah. Mmm-hmm. (CHUCKLES) We are, but listen, man. Let me tell you something. If you think for one second that a couple wholesale Wiis is gonna get your Jolly Green Giant looking ass into Copeland Briggs? You got another thing coming, bro. (CHUCKLING) (SIGHS) Man, whats that? You sit me down next to Briggs, you always got that number next time you get pinched. You know how much that's worth. Hey. As requested. Nobody knows about this? Nope. Not even you? I have no idea what you're talking about. BURGESS: Delany, I'm glad Platt partnered us up. I've been looking forward to working with an experienced officer. DELANY: Yeah, well... My name's Burgess. DELANEY: I'm gonna park it right here. Do you see something? Are we on to something? I'm just gonna rest my eyes for a minute. (SIGHS) (SNORING) (SIGHS) (CELL PHONE CHIMING) (CHUCKLES) What is it? Ah, Burgess, she got a sleeping beauty. Burgess, huh? Just get your head in the game. Okay, Pards. (KNOCKS AT DOOR) How well you know these guys, Mouse? I don't know. How well does anybody know anybody, you know? That's not that helpful. What do we got? You're looking for some stuff I can get for you. Stuff? Like what exactly? Blasting caps. Det cord. Why would I need something like that? Hey what you do with it's your business, right? Really, Detective? Would it be my business? Detective? What you talking about, Charlie? Here, this is... Shut up, Mouse. We met at the station with Erin Lindsay, or did you forget? No. I definitely wouldn't forget something like that. Is there anything you want to tell us, Charlie? Nope. I'm super cool, man. Tell Erin I said hey, though. Back in the day, she was, mmm, something. (CHUCKLES) What the hell was that? Just like he said, I met him with Lindsay. I'm so made, man. Relax, Mouse. I got you on this. Okay, what's our next play here? I don't know yet. Uh-huh. I heard what the doctor said. Yes, this is me healing up. Doing my job and not staring at the ceiling. Two things I love to do. This is stressful. Arguing with you right now is stressful. Baby? Hey, Nadia. Antonio Dawson. I work with Erin. Yeah, I remember. Well, she's very sorry but a case jumped off so, I'm supposed to bring you back to bring you back to the district. It's cool. I'll take the bus. Are you kidding me right now? Come on. I mean it's a little weird. You know, Lindsay's supposed to be picking me up. She dodges my texts. Now a cop shows up and wants me to get into his car? What address is that? Clinic. Here. Is that a man handwriting or a woman's? Woman's. Right. Will you please get in the car? Yeah. Sorry I yelled at you. Thank you. It's my wife. OFFICER: (ON RADIO) 21-13. We got a panic alarm tripped at 601, West Adams. 21-13, we got a panic alarm tripped, 601, West Adams. Do you copy? 21-13. 10-4, en route! Panic alarm sounded, 601 West Adams. Honey, I don't know your name. I don't wanna know your name. But after today, we're through. Oh, you're damn right we are. This is far too important. We have to pursue this. Yeah, well sit tight until I give the word. Whoa, hey, hey. You can't talk to me like I just joined the unit, man. I put my vest on every day. I get my knuckles dirty every day, just like you. Come on. No, right. You're right. I'll talk to Erin. Okay. (CLEARS THROAT) Charlie Pugliese, or however you say his frigging name, you know what he's into? Why? I just had a CI sit me down in front of him. He's involved in the construction site hit. Oh. What do you need here, Erin? I can handle it. Really? How? When? Voight's upstairs. He's waiting for an update. Just stall. I just need to move a couple things around. What does this guy have on you? It's bad. What's Voight always say? Tell him the truth so he can lie for you. No. If I tell the truth on this one I'm done. Do you understand? There a dead security guard that they left behind a dumpster. Like a bag of trash. Oh, man. I was telling Friedman he hit the alarm. He, he said "No I didn't." I said, "I'll bet you a Pizano's deep dish you did." Well, he's gonna be paying now. So, false alarm? Yeah. Sorry. They really gotta move that alarm button. It's right at knee level. DELANEY: Well, as long as we're here I'll take a, uh, beef and sausage combo 21-13, reporting a robbery in progress, 601 West Adams requesting immediate backup. What're you doing? As we were coming out, I saw the security camera lens had been freshly sprayed with black paint. I also saw the cash drawer was open, no tray. (GROANS) Show me your hands. (GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) My name is Burgess, by the way. Feel free to forget it. The kid here set up an appointment with Copeland Briggs. Let me get this straight. You talked to a guy, in order to talk to a guy? Sarge, Copeland Briggs, he... ...comes to you, not the other way around. It true. It was worth the trip. All right, so what's Briggs gonna get us? Word I got is he provided a little off- the-books security to that construction site. Briggs will know who was involved in the robbery, for a fact. Yeah, go ahead. What about Halstead's CI? Snake eyes. Took you guys four hours to roll that? It was a big run around, boss. You know how it is. I guess I'm beginning to. Jin. What do you got? I got ears in Voight's office, like you wanted. You don't say? It's Lindsay. She was sniffing around for some blueprints to a jewelry mart. I don't know what it is but, well, that's something, right? I need details. Your father and his gambling problems need details. I know. I know. I don't want immigration involved with your old man, but without details what choice do I have? Let's go for a ride. Keep driving. Turn. I don't know what you think I might've said or done... Pull over up here. Something you want to tell me? Look, obviously, something happened... (GRUNTS) You told Platt you were updating the computer in my office. It hasn't been updated. Then you meet with Internal Affairs. (SNIFFLING) They busted up an underground casino my dad owes money to. Stillwell's been using it against me. Everybody gets squeezed, Jin. Aah! You violated my number one rule. Who do you work for? You. You. (ANTONIO WHISTLING) Hey. (LINDSAY CHUCKLES) Oh! Come on. Thank you. Hey. Your wife called. (ANTONIO SIGHS) So the next step would be finding a job. A real job. (CHUCKLES) One that I'm proud of. You have any leads? Well, nothing in stone but, uh, there's this woman that helps out at the clinic. She said she'd introduce me to her daughter who runs some sort of clothing store or something. I don't know. I, uh, I need to work on that one. It's all good. Listen, Nadia, don't break my heart again. I won't. I promise. All right. Uh, you're gonna stay up here until I'm off, all right? It might be awhile, but, you can stay with me till you get settled. Okay. Okay. (DOOR SHUTS) Is everything all right? Uh, no. Not by a long shot. Charlie Pugliese. What now? Yeah... Back then, I was a mess. You know. I thought that I loved him. Erin. You were 16. He was 25. Got you hooked on dope. Yeah. I don't deny any of that. But dad had been locked up forever when my mom stopped coming home at all. Charlie kept the heat on. He kept food on the table. I was loyal to him. And if that's a fault of mine, then so be it. But, um... But my best friend, Annie, she was mixed up with Charlie, too, and... And she got pulled into some stuff, way worse than me and, um... (SOFTLY) Hey. You're gonna be okay. Just tell me what's going on. He's got us boxed in real bad. Me and Annie both. Well, I need a couple clean-cut white guys. You got any white guys in the house? I'm one-sixteenth Cherokee, does that disqualify me? No, you're good. What's the play? The kid's got a sit-down with Copeland Briggs. Gonna run a game on him. See what he knows about the robbery. Hit it. What do you got, bro? These are records of anyone with explosives trainings who recently got out ofjail. I'm looking for any mentions of water gels or det cords in their arrest records. All right. Keep looking. What do you think I'm doing? (SIGHS) It's Laura. She nearly flipped when I told her I was coming back to work. What does she expect you to do? She wants me to move out to Crystal Lake near her sister. Barney Fife it out there. Well, she's been through a lot. Your whole family has. I know. But... (SIGHS) I hear you. Met your detective friend. Had a look in his eye when I said your name. I seen that look in your boys' eyes before. Don't. Here's your blueprints. I need one more thing. Go to hell. Just call in a shooter at the Hancock at midnight. That should get a lot of attention, eh? Almost there. Five-yard line. That's my girl. (TALKING INDISTINCTLY) All right, players, listen up. You two are Northwestern kids. You sell 100 pounds of weed every month all over the Big Ten. Of which there are 12 schools. Somebody explain that one to me. Let's just do this. ATWATER: Exactly. I'm gonna tell Briggs that in return for the info on you guys, all I wanna know is what he knows about the construction robbery. You feel me? They feel you. I'll wait outside. No doubt. Let's do it. What's up, dog? What's going on? Where's Copeland Briggs? I got some stone cold Wildcats right here. Yeah? Yeah. Uh, yeah, well, uh, I think I changed my mind about this deal. How? What's up, Briggs? Who's you? Who's this? Here to make you rich, boy. I'm rich already, homie. Ways you don't even know. What's up? Wait, hold, hold, wait, now see these are my homies. All right? Now, these are a couple of, uh... Cops. We're all cops. I think you're in my chair. Why don't you hop up? We'd like to know about the construction site robbery. And? What's in it for me? Nothing! So how about we let the school around the corner get out. Let all the kids file by, and they can see the cops just kicking it with Copeland Briggs. Maybe later we'll get a 12-pack, bring it by your place, let everybody know that you're CI, at best. Or you just tell us what we want right now, and we'll be out of here in 30 seconds. Look, man. Dude named Red Radner stopped by here, dropped a bunch of bread off for us to watch the gate at the construction site, while a bunch of white boys went in there and robbed the place. Now, I heard gunshots but I ain't know nobody got killed. That's all I know. Atwater, sometimes the badge is mightier than the BS. Kevin Red Radner. He's wanted in New York, Indiana and Illinois for murder, armed robbery, and trafficking. Drugs or... ANTONIO: Girls. Beat a rape charge too. VOIGHT: We like him for pulling the strings on that construction site robbery. He's in the wind, but he's had a lot of prior dealings with this guy. Charlie Pugliese. We have every reason to believe Pugliese was part of Red's crew. A tip from a CI came in, said Pugliese is planning on using the explosives stolen from that site, to knock off this jewelry exchange on North Lawndale. We're moving out. We can't avoid this. I know. All right. Be ready. All right. That's it. Move in. (TIRES SCREECHING) Hands up. Keep 'em up! Don't move! RUZEK: Freeze! OLINSKY: Put them against the wall. HALSTEAD: Put your hands up. Get them up. RUZEK: Back away. HALSTEAD: Just turn around. Get them hands up! Do it now. Against the wall. Stay there. Don't move. OLINSKY: I got him. Keep them high. ATWATER: Yeah. Yeah. Look away. Anything in the trunk that could hurt me? No. OLINSKY: I don't hear you. CHARLIE: No. OLINSKY: Explosives in the car. I'd like to report a murder from October 12, 2002. Victim's name was Ricky Sandoval. I have all the information. Who killed him and who helped get rid of the body. Put him in the car. Anything from the other two? Lawyered up. All right, everybody clear out. Hang on. I want to talk to him first. Then you can do whatever you want. (SIGHS) You wanted to go by the book, Erin, well, here we are. You know what Sandoval was doing to Annie. You know why she snapped. It's too late for all that. I gave you a chance to keep it buried. And you want to go public about everything, fine. But just so you know, I'm gonna say I killed Sandoval. To keep Annie and Travis together. Wow, you really are a cop, aren't you? Bluffing your ass off. Try me. You let Voight run me out of town. With nothing. Nothing! You were headed for the bottom of the lake. I begged for your life. Do something with it. For once. Give us Radner, cooperate fully, and you're out in a year. Clean yourself up on the inside, become a man, and then maybe you can be a dad to your son. Or give a statement on Sandoval, and then you and me, we can go down the tubes together. (ON SPEAKER) It's up to you. I didn't kill that guard. Red did. Where is he now? He's waiting for his cut of the heist. He was gonna call me. But he ain't calling now. Where does he flop? (ON SPEAKER) Does he have a girl in town? I heard one of the guys say he worked out of a warehouse in B. Y. Never heard of that area before. A lot's changed in 12 years, I guess. B. Y? I've never heard of it before. I don't think anyone has. (RUZEK SIGHS) Hey, you know, at my old job sometimes we'd get called to this area behind the stockyards. Um, guys liked to park there 'cause it was quiet at night. Back of the yards was B.Y. Let's go. PLATT: Hey, Burgess. Sergeant. How do you like working with Delaney? He's soft. And you yourself, you once told me that you have no tolerance for soft cops. You know what? I don't either. I want someone like Atwater, someone who isn't afraid to mix it up. Otherwise, what the hell am I doing this for? You're right. He's a dog ass. When you got passed over for Intelligence, I thought for sure you'd crumble like a chocolate chip cookie. So tomorrow, I'll put you with Gogan. He's, uh, only a few years on the job but he's good police. Thank you, Sergeant. I'll just deny every word of this conversation. Of course. Hey. BURGESS: Hey. I heard you had a good bust. Yeah. Well, thanks to you I get to keep proving myself as a uniform. (LAUGHS) I guess I had that coming. I'll see you later. It's pretty secure. Metal doors, boards on the windows. The usual. This is definitely the place. Guy just pulled in the van, put eyes on me. VOIGHT: (ON PHONE) Did he make you as police? I can't tell. VOIGHT: (OVER PHONE) All right. Keep your eyes on the place. (GUNFIRE) Yeah, I'd say I'm made! (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (TIRES SCREECH) (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) Ten-one! Multiple shots fired at the police. We are taking heavy fire. Need immediate back up. Requesting S.W.A.T. VOIGHT: Van! Van! (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) (TIRES SCREECH) LINDSAY: Go, go, go! Get alongside. (GUNSHOTS) (GLASS SHATTERING) Glare. I can't clear. HALSTEAD: Cover back. Don't move! Show me your hands! Gun! I got a gun! (GUNSHOT) Squared away? (SIGHS) Yeah. Paperwork up the ying yang, but I'm toast for today. Thank you, for everything. That's why you have back-up. Yeah, I guess so. (SIGHS) Hank? There's a lot of ways this relationship can go, but I figured this is the easiest. It's 5,000. It's 10 percent of what I just took off the street. Totally untraceable. (SIGHS) Dad? I need you to pack up everything you have, okay? And get out of Chicago. Go now, Dad. Go. I'll call you. Bye. (PANTING) (SIGHS) Adam. Hey. Hey. I, um... I came here to apologize to you. Okay. So, I'm sorry. You're a really good cop and you are gonna get your shot again soon. You came all the way here just to tell me that? I like you. I know you know that. And I miss you. He's the only good thing I've ever done. That's not true. You know what I mean. You're a good mom. Let's leave it at that. I don't even know what I would have done if he was taken away from me. You don't have to think about that now. So, Charlie... Confessed. He'll probably get a little rhythm for cooperating. Annie, I'm sorry. I should have never let Charlie back in. People don't change. You did. Hey, guys. Dad's home. Laura? Guys? (SIRENS WAILING) Sheldon Jin. I believe he worked in your unit. Yeah. That's right. Ripped By mstoll (THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
