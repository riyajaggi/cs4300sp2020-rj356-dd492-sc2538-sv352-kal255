I NEVER WIN. - A BOAT. - HOLY SMOKE. SORRY TO WIN AND RUN, GENTLEMEN, BUT THERE'S SIMPLY NO COMPETITION. LISTEN, STEPHENS, A WORD OF ADVICE.

FINE. IT'S SATURDAY NIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ANYWAY? WELL, YOU MIGHT AS WELL KNOW... I GUESS EVERYONE ELSE DOES... I CAME TO SEE YOU. OH. APPARENTLY I'M WEARING MY HEART ON MY SLEEVE. OR HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED? WELL, YOU'VE BEEN VERY FRIENDLY. I APPRECIATE THAT. I SEE. YOU'RE NOT GONNA MAKE THIS EASY FOR ME, ARE YOU? TEN YEARS, BEN. THERE'S A LOT OF BLOOD SPILLED IN OUR RELATIONSHIP. YOU STILL DON'T FORGIVE ME FOR LEAVING? OH, I FORGIVE YOU, SURE. IT'S A LOT HARDER TO FORGET. LOOK, IF I COULD CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT I DID, YOU KNOW... I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO. IF I COULD, I WOULD. YOU'RE NOT LISTENING, BEN. I FORGIVE YOU. REALLY, I DO. YOU MEAN, WHAT I'M FEELING, YOU DON'T FEEL ANYTHING LIKE THAT? BEN, I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU. WELL, WONDERFUL. SO, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT YOU THAT WAY. IT'S 10 YEARS, NANCE. I MEAN, I'VE CHANGED. SO HAVE I. IF THIS WERE 10 YEARS AGO, I'D JUMP INTO BED WITH YOU RIGHT NOW. LOOK, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE THROWING OUT VERY MIXED SIGNALS HERE. NO, I'M NOT. I'M TRYING TO BE AS HONEST WITH YOU AS I CAN. WELL... I THINK YOU'RE IRRESPONSIBLE. NOT TO YOUR WORK BUT TO PEOPLE. I WOULD HAVE GONE ANYWHERE WITH YOU. I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING. IT TOOK ME A VERY LONG TIME TO GET TO THE POINT... WHERE YOU DON'T INTERFERE WITH MY LIVING MY LIFE. AND NOW YOU DON'T. I LIKE MY LIFE. I LIKE WHAT I'M DOING. I AM PERFECTLY HAPPY. I'M DYING FOR YOU. YOU WON'T DIE, BEN. I DIDN'T. BESIDES THAT, IT'D PROBABLY BE A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. NOT A CHANCE. NOW YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE, DON'T YOU? I COULDN'T GO THROUGH IT AGAIN, BEN. I DON'T WANT TO. YOU SPOILED THE MOOD, HUGH. YOU ALWAYS SPOIL THE MOOD. STILL CAN'T SLEEP, HUH? NOT CAN'T, WON'T. TOO MUCH TO THINK ABOUT. YEAH, WELL, I'LL HAVE THEM GIVE YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP. HELP ME SLEEP OR HELP ME THINK? REALLY, I DON'T FEEL LIKE SLEEPING. I THINK PERHAPS YOU'RE RIGHT AFTER ALL. MAYBE IT'S TIME I STOP BEING A BIRD. I'VE BEEN EVERY SPECIES OF BIRD KNOWN TO HUMANKIND, AND IT STILL HASN'T HELPED. THE QUESTION IS THEN WHAT SHOULD I BE? WELL, THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION, RALPH. MAYBE I'LL JUST BE MYSELF. I LIKE THAT ANSWER. I THOUGHT YOU WOULD. IT'S A CRISP, COOL NIGHT. THE KIND THAT'S BETTER IN BOSTON THAN ANY CITY IN THE WORLD. GIVE ME A NICE WARM BREEZE BLOWIN' IN OFF THE GULF COAST ANYTIME. TOO MUCH HUMIDITY, HUGH. NOT FOR ME. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN BOSTON ANYWAY, HUGH? YOU'RE LIKE A DUCK OUT OF WATER UP HERE. I CAN SEE YOU IN MOBILE, ALABAMA OR TUSCALOOSA. BUT YOU A BOSTON BRAHMIN? I GOT SICK OF PAWPAWS. DO YOU EVER MISS IT? GULFPORT, MISSISSIPPI, I MEAN. NOT THE PLACE SO MUCH... MOSTLY I MISS MY PEOPLE. YOUR FOLKS STILL THERE? MM-HMM. IT'S FUNNY. I'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME BEING ANGRY AT MY FOLKS. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THEM NOW? I FEEL SORRY FOR THEM. THEY'VE REALIZED HOW BADLY THEY SCREWED THINGS UP. RALPH... NO, I KNOW, I KNOW. THEY WEREN'T SURE WHAT TO DO WITH A KID WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A GENIUS. THEY THOUGHT WHAT THEY WERE DOING WAS RIGHT. THEY WERE TOLD THAT M.I.T. WAS THE BEST PLACE FOR YOU. I WAS 14 YEARS OLD MY FRESHMAN YEAR. I DIDN'T SHAVE TILL I WAS 18. MY PARENTS NEVER KNEW HOW TO ACT AROUND ME. NOW THEY CAN'T BEAR TO SEE ME. SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ACT AROUND THEM... OR ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER. THE ONLY PERSON WHO I EVER FELT COMFORTABLE WITH WAS JANE, THE MOTHER OF MY CHILD. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO HER RECENTLY? I TALKED TO HER ON THE PHONE A WEEK AGO. SHE SOUNDS HAPPY. I FEEL HAPPY FOR HER. SHE'S MOVING TO ARIZONA. YEAH. I THINK BEING WITH HER FATHER'S THE BEST THING FOR HER, DON'T YOU? YES, YES, I DO. "THINGS FALL APART. THE CENTER CANNOT HOLD." WHAT'S THAT? THAT'S FROM A POEM BY YEATS. SORT OF DESCRIBES MY RELATION TO THE WORLD. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE WORLD, AND THE WORLD DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF ME. HOW ARE HIS PUPILS? SLUGGISH. HIS TEMPERATURE'S NORMAL. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD SIGN. THE BODY'S RESPONSE TO INFECTION IS TO PRODUCE FEVER. IF THERE'S NO FEVER, IT MEANS HE'S NOT FIGHTING OFF THE INFECTION. ANY RESPONSE TO DEEP PAIN STIMULATION? NO. HIS PUPILS ARE DILATED, BUT THEY'RE NOT FIXED. THEY REACT ONLY MINIMALLY TO LIGHT. HAS HE BEEN DECEREBRATING? YES. HIS BRAIN'S NOT ACTIVE. IT'S OBVIOUSLY VERY INFECTED. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. IT'S TOO FAST. WE'RE LOSING HIM. HE'S NOT GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH THE NIGHT, JACK. BETTER CALL THE FAMILY. I SAY THE BREAKING OUT OF DISEASES LIKE HERPES II... OR, UH, KAPOSI'S SARCOMA ARE NATURE'S WAY OF TELLING US TO SLOW DOWN SEXUALLY. IS THAT YOUR RATIONALE FOR NOT HAVING A DATE IN THE PAST SIX WEEKS? YOU LAUGH, BUT I GOT THIS FRIEND, BOB MacGONIGAL. HE FOUND OUT HE HAD CHRONIC HEPATITIS. - FISCUS, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? - OKAY, KEEP YOUR SCRUBS ON. HEY, ANY CHANCE OF ME GETTING A SEAT IN THIS GAME? SURE. THE CARDS AREN'T GONNA CHANGE, FISCUS, NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU LOOK AT THEM. OKAY, OKAY. I SEE YOUR DIME AND I RAISE A NICKEL. NICKELS AND DIMES? MY GRANDMOTHER DOESN'T PLAY FOR NICKELS AND DIMES. YEAH, WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE GET FOR PLAYING WITH LARRY, MOE AND CURLY. - BEN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE? - BURY THESE. RUMOR MILL HAS IT YOU'RE OUT SOMEWHERE MAKING TIME WITH NANCY PAXTON. SHE REJECTED HIM. I SEE YOUR PLACEBO AND RAISE YOU ONE. JACK IT UP. WAIT, WAIT. WHAT'S THIS? SHE TOLD HIM TO GO HANG HIS SHINGLE ELSEWHERE. COME ON, LESS TALK, MORE ACTION, OKAY? IS THIS TRUE, BEN? WELL, THIS... THIS KIND OF SHAKES MY FAITH IN... WELL, IN SOMETHING. YEAH. MIGHTY CASEY STRUCK OUT. COME ON, YOU GUYS. I'M WAY DOWN, AND NOW YOU'RE FOOLING AROUND! - GIMME A CHANCE, WILL YA? - WHAT ARE YOU STILL DOING HERE, BEN? WHAT? OH, I JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE GOING HOME TONIGHT. - I'M OUT. - FINE, HE'S OUT. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, MAVERICK? I CALL. FINE. HERE, THREE 8's. YOU'RE GOOD, KID, BUT YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH. A FLUSH? YOU JUST CALL ME WITH A FLUSH? BETTER QUIT NOW, EHRLICH. OH, MY MARKER. FILL THIS FOR ME, WILL YOU, DOCTOR? DR. MORRISON. OH. HELLO. DID YOU TELL THEM WE DON'T THINK MICKEY'S GONNA MAKE IT? YES. THEY WANNA KNOW IF THERE'S STILL ANY HOPE. HIS HEART RATE'S DOWN TO 40. HE DOESN'T... UH, I DON'T THINK SO, NO. - I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. - WHAT DID HE SAY? EITHER MY MANDARIN'S GETTING WEAK, OR HE JUST SAID HE WANTS TO PERFORM ULTIMATE CHINESE MEDICINE ON HIS SON. WHAT IS ULTIMATE CHINESE MEDICINE? IT'S AN OLD CHINESE SUPERSTITION. SOMETIMES THEY USE COINS, CANDLES. THEY SPREAD IT ALL OVER A ROOM. I'M NOT SURE. I'VE NEVER SEEN IT. IT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU HEAR ABOUT WHEN YOU'RE A KID. BUT IS THERE ANYTHING INVASIVE? NEEDLES OR DROPS? I'LL ASK. HE SAID, NO, NOTHING THAT WOULD UPSET YOUR PROCEDURES. SURE. WHY NOT? IF IT'LL MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER. TELL THEM WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. GIMME A HAND, FOR GOD'S SAKE! COME ON. WE NEED YOU! GURNEY. GET THE GURNEY! THERE'S BLOOD ALL OVER THE BACK OF MY CAB. WE'VE GOT A BULLET HOLE ENTRANCE WOUND IN THE LEFT POSTERIOR CHEST. AND AN EXIT OUT THE ABDOMEN WITH A FOUR-BY-SIX CENTIMETER DEFECT. I DON'T THINK HE'S BREATHING. CALL THE CODE. GET AN O.R. READY.

WHEN I LOOKED BACK UP, THE OLDER GUY PULLS A GUN OUT, AND PUTS IT RIGHT ON THE YOUNGER GUY'S CHEST. YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU WOULD PUT YOUR FINGER ON SOMEONE'S CHEST. AND THEN THE YOUNGER GUY TURNS AWAY FOR A SECOND, AND THE OLDER GUY SHOOTS HIM RIGHT IN THE BACK. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I'VE BEEN WORKING THAT COMBAT ZONE FOR FIVE YEARS.

IT'S OKAY, JACK. IT'S OKAY. HE SAYS THEY'RE BIRTH COINS. HE SAYS HE THINKS THE EYES ARE THE MIRROR OF THE SOUL. THE HEAT OF THE COINS WILL REAWAKEN THE DORMANT CONSCIOUSNESS. THEY REALLY THINK THIS IS GOING TO SAVE HIM? YES. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK THE BOY HAS SPINAL MENINGITIS. HIS CORTEX IS NEARLY DEAD. I DON'T THINK HE HAS A PRAYER. NEITHER DO I.

JACK, YOU WANT TO SIT IN WITH US OVER HERE? UH, NO, I'LL PASS. YOU DON'T DO THAT UNTIL YOU'VE LOOKED AT YOUR CARDS. I'VE NEVER BEEN MUCH OF A CARD PLAYER. WE REALLY COULD USE A FIFTH MAN, JACK.

OH, RALPH, WHAT BRINGS YOU DOWN HERE AT THE CRACK OF DAWN? I'D LIKE SOME BREAKFAST. I'M SORRY, RALPH, BUT THEY WON'T LET ME ORDER THEM SEEDS FOR YOU NO MORE. OH, NO MORE CARAWAY SEEDS FOR ME. I WANT A BIG BREAKFAST... HAM, EGGS, BACON... AND A SHORT STACK OF BLUEBERRY PANCAKES WITH SOME REAL BUTTER. YOU WANT ALL THAT, DO YOU? MAN CANNOT LIVE BY WORMS ALONE. YOU DONE THAT? YOU EAT WORMS? YES, AT ONE TIME IN MY LIFE. I DID. WHAT THEY TASTE LIKE? I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO. JUST PRIOR TO MY COMING HERE. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I NEVER EVEN REMEMBER EATING THEM. THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW YOU DID? I WAS TOLD BY RELIABLE SOURCES. OH. WELL, ANYWAY, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT FOR ALL THAT FOOD. I HAVEN'T GOT THE GRILL UP YET. I GOT SOME COFFEE READY THOUGH. NO, I DON'T THINK SO. BUT HOW ABOUT A DANISH AND A LARGE GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE? MM. I'M FEELING EXTRAORDINARILY WELL THIS MORNING. DO YOU KNOW THAT, EARL? GOOD, RALPH, GOOD. I HAVEN'T SLEPT, BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT, IT'S A NEW DAY, A NEW DAWN IN THE LIFE OF RALPH SELOVER. YOU'RE FEELING GOOD, RALPH, AIN'T YA? THANK YOU, EARL. THANK YOU MY GOOD MAN, MY FRIEND, MON AMI TRÈS HEUREUX. MY VERY HAPPY FRIEND. OH, YEAH, THAT'S ME. YOU ARE HAPPY, AREN'T YOU, EARL? WITH YOUR LIFE, I MEAN. OF COURSE I'M HAPPY. WHAT'S NOT TO BE HAPPY ABOUT? MY PENSION'S COMIN' UP, ME AND MY WIFE BE MOVIN' DOWN SOUTH TO THE GRANDCHILDREN. THAT'S TERRIFIC. THAT'S WONDERFUL. KIDS, GREAT KIDS. JUST WONDERFUL. GIVE THEM A KISS FOR ME. WELL, IT WON'T BE A WHILE YET. AS A MATTER OF FACT, MAKE THAT FOUR. TWO ON EACH CHEEK. WILL YOU DO THAT FOR ME? I WILL, RALPH. I WILL. THANK YOU, EARL. SEE YA. I, UH... I REPEATED THE LUMBAR PUNCTURE ON MICKEY WONG. UH-HUH. HIS BRUDZINSKI SIGN IS NEGATIVE. GOOD. GOOD. WE SHOULD HAVE AN ACCURATE READ ON HIM IN AN HOUR. OKAY. NANCY, I'M SORRY, BUT I... I MEAN, THAT BOY WAS ALMOST DEAD TWO HOURS AGO, AND NOW HE'S SITTING UP, EATING PIZZA... AS THOUGH NOTHING HAD EVER HAPPENED. IT IS THE SINGLE MOST AMAZING, WONDERFUL THING I HAVE EVER SEEN. AND YET YOU SIT HERE AS THOUGH IT'S AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE. AS OPPOSED TO A MIRACLE? THAT'S RIGHT. HOW CAN YOU TELL ME... THAT IT WAS THE PENICILLIN THAT CURED HIM? THE LUMBAR PUNCTURE SHOWED PUS EIGHT HOURS AGO. DO YOU HAVE A MORE PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATION? NO. BUT I KNOW WHAT I SAW. ULTIMATE CHINESE MEDICINE. AND YOU'RE GOING TO WRITE THAT UP? UH-HUH. CANDLES, BURNED COINS, PINK HARD-BOILED EGGS, ARRANGED IN A HALF-MOON ON THE PILLOW? WELL, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, WHY DON'T YOU MENTION THE SPACESHIP WE SAW TONIGHT? THE BLUE-GREEN GLOW OF THE MUSIC, UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'D EVER HEARD. HOW INCREDIBLY FRIENDLY THEY WERE. YOU CANNOT WRITE IT UP, JACK. THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE RECOGNIZES PENICILLIN, NOT MIRACLES. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S A FIRST-YEAR RESIDENT MAKING THE CLAIM. YOU WOULD LOSE ALL YOUR CREDIBILITY. THEN PENICILLIN IT IS. NANCY. JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME, WHAT DO YOU REALLY THINK? NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. IT ABSOLUTELY WAS A MIRACLE. I GUESS ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE. I GUESS. HELLO, HUGH. RALPH. I THOUGHT I'D COME UP AND SEE THE SUNRISE. OH, YOU DID, DID YOU? I KNOW, I KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA GO ON ABOUT THE RULES. THAT'S RIGHT, I AM. WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT THE VIEW JUST ISN'T THE SAME FROM MY ROOM. BUILDINGS AND BARS, THAT'S ALL I CAN SEE. WELL, OKAY. REALLY, HUGH. IS IT THE TRUTH OR NOT? I MEAN, WE'VE SAT THROUGH QUITE A FEW SUNRISES DOWN THERE TOGETHER. IS IT THE PITS, OR WHAT? IT ISN'T THE BEST VIEW IN THE WORLD, NO. THANK YOU. WE HAVE SOME ROOMS THAT HAVE BETTER VANTAGE POINTS. WE'LL MOVE YOU TO ONE OF THOSE. THANK YOU. STAND RIGHT THERE, HUGH. THANK YOU. OH, IT SHOULD BE A FANTASTIC SUNRISE. JUST ENOUGH CLOUDS IN THE SKY TO MAKE IT COLORFUL. REDDISH-PINK. YOU THINK I'M GONNA JUMP, DON'T YOU? WELL, LET ME CALM YOUR ANXIETY. I'M NOT. BUT IF I WERE, I WOULDN'T FALL, I'D FLUTTER. AND I WOULDN'T LIGHT ON THE SIDEWALK. I'D LAND ON A SAILING MAST BOUND FOR... WHERE WAS IT, HUGH? DIDN'T IT USED TO BE PORTUGAL? IT STILL CAN BE. THAT WAS YOUR DREAM. IT WAS OURS, JANE'S AND MINE. THE ULTIMATE MIGRATION. THE QUINTESSENTIAL FLIGHT. BIRDS OF PASSAGE. BIRDS OF THE DAY, OF THE NIGHT, OF DAWN. THE FINAL ROOST, HUGH, THE FINAL ROOST. AND NOW THAT'S ALL GONE FOREVER. JANE IS NOT A BIRD ANYMORE, RALPH.
