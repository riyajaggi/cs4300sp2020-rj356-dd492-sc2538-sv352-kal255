 St. Elsewhere (1982–1988): Season 1, Episode 1 - Pilot - full transcript 
 In this first episode we are introduced to the hectic pace of St. Eligius and the toll it can take on some of it's principle characters. Life and death decisions must be made quickly and this doesn't leave room for professional courtesies or emotions which explode in unexpected directions at unexpected times. This pilot is a great primer on the characters and atmosphere one can expect at St. Eligius, better known as St. Elsewhere by those who can or can't afford to go somewhere else.

FOR YOUR INFORMATION, DOCTOR, IT IS ROUTINE TO SURGICALLY REMOVE AN ABSCESS. YEAH? FOR YOUR INFORMATION, IF YOU CUT THROUGH THE ABSCESSED WALL, AND IT'S AMOEBIC, THE PARASITES COULD SPREAD, AND SHE COULD CONCEIVABLY DIE. DID YOU ORDER A LIVER BIOPSY? YES.

I IMAGINE YOU TOLD THE CHARGE NURSE, WHO, IN TURN, PASSED THIS INFORMATION ON TO SOMEONE ELSE. YES. WHO, IN TURN... I GUESS SO. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EVERYONE IN THE HOSPITAL KNEW THAT THIS MAN WAS MISSING... EXCEPT SECURITY. I DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON TO GET HYSTERICAL. - YOU WEREN'T THINKING, CAVANERO. - I THOUGHT I COULD HANDLE IT. WHAT'S THE TROUBLE, ANNIE? DR. WESTPHALL, THERE'S NO TROUBLE. COME ON. A PATIENT IS MISSING, AND YOU DON'T NOTIFY SECURITY? YOUR JOB IS TO TREAT HIM, YOU KNOW, NOT TO FIND HIM. NOW, WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE? DID YOU SEE THE WHITE SHEET ON HENRY SMITH? NO, I DIDN'T. THE MAN HASN'T HAD A GOOD DAY IN HIS LIFE. NO HOME, NO FAMILY, NOTHING. A NOBODY. THE KIND OF TRASH YOU SEE WASHED UP ON THE STREETS EVERY DAY, BUT YOU NEVER STOP TO LOOK BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU TOO UNCOMFORTABLE. HENRY SMITH IS MY PATIENT. HE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY. DR. CAVANERO, WE ARE ALL AWARE OF YOUR SKILLS AS A PHYSICIAN, AND THEY'RE CONSIDERABLE. BUT NONE OF US IS EXPECTED TO HANDLE EVERYTHING, NOT EVEN A WOMAN. - ANYTHING ELSE, DR. WESTPHALL? - MM-HMM.

SHE THINKS THE WORLD OF YOU TOO. I'VE JUST BEEN EXPLAINING TO MRS. MALIN WHAT'S WRONG WITH SANDY. THIS REALLY HAS BEEN QUITE A SHOCK. NOT ONLY WAS I UNAWARE THAT SANDY WAS IN THE HOSPITAL, WHICH, KNOWING SANDY, SHOULDN'T SURPRISE ME, BUT SHE GOT BACK FROM SOUTH AMERICA OVER SIX WEEKS AGO, AND SHE'S BEEN PERFECTLY FINE EVER SINCE. WELL, THESE PARASITES CAN LIE DORMANT FOR A WHILE BEFORE BECOMING ACTIVE. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TREAT THE PROBLEM NOW, AND SANDY SHOULD BE OUT WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO. UH, JACK, MRS. MALIN WANTS TO MOVE SANDY TO BOSTON GENERAL TOMORROW. WHY? WELL, OUR DOCTOR IN MARYLAND TOLD US... THAT BOSTON GENERAL IS A NEWER, MORE MODERN HOSPITAL. MRS. MALIN, HER CARE WON'T BE ANY BETTER THERE THAN HERE. I PROMISE YOU THAT. DR. MORRISON, PLEASE. I APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR SANDY. YOU HAVE MANY PATIENTS. I HAVE ONLY ONE DAUGHTER, AND I MUST DO WHAT I THINK IS BEST. WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR DAUGHTER... THERE'S NO PROBLEM, MRS. MALIN. WE'LL HAVE SANDY MOVED TOMORROW. THANK YOU. BYE. BYE. THANK YOU. BYE. WHY DID YOU LET HER DO THAT? BECAUSE I'M NOT SANDY'S PARENT. BUT THERE WAS NO REASON FOR IT. IT'S NOT PERSONAL, JACK. YEAH, IT'S PERSONAL. SHE'S MY PATIENT.

THIS ISN'T A BACK ALLEY KNIFE WOUND. THIS IS KISMET. KISMET? MARK HAS BEEN SHARING HIS THOUGHTS ON HOW BEST TO DEAL WITH THE TERRORIST SITUATION. THE PRESS IS SALIVATING. MARK HAS CALLED A PRESS CONFERENCE FOR TOMORROW MORNING, 7:30. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO A THING LIKE THAT? WHY? BECAUSE THAT SLUG IS A HEADLINER, AND GOD KNOWS WE CAN USE THE PUBLICITY. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THAT SLUG WAS A PATIENT OF OURS, MARK, NOT SOME IN-HOUSE CELEBRITY. NO? WELL, TELL ME, WAS THE VERMIN THAT SHOT THAT JUDGE LAST MONTH... WAS HE JUST A PATIENT? COME ON! BOSTON GENERAL MADE CERTAIN... THAT EVERYBODY AND HIS MOTHER KNEW THEY WERE TREATING THAT LITTLE SCUM. YOU COULDN'T FLIP A CHANNEL WITHOUT SEEING MOUSY JIMMY O'TOOLE. WHO'S JIMMY O'TOOLE? THE HOSPITAL SPOKESMAN! WHERE HAS HE BEEN? WHY DON'T WE HIRE AN ADVERTISING AGENCY AND DO A WHOLE CAMPAIGN? YOU KNOW, DONALD? YOU CAN BE A VERY NEGATIVE-THINKING PERSON. DO YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE CALL THIS PLACE? NOT ST. ELIGIUS. ST. ELSEWHERE. A DUMPING GROUND, A PLACE YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO SEND YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW. NOW SOMEBODY AROUND HERE IS TRYING TO GARNER A LITTLE GOODWILL PUBLICITY... AND POSSIBLY RAISE A FEW BUCKS FOR THIS RATHOLE, AND ALL I'M GETTING IS PROBLEMS. NOW, MARK... NO, NO. I MEAN IT! I MEAN, WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS INITIATIVE. THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE, BUT I SECURED THE NEW CLOCKS. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, THEY ALL READ THE SAME TIME... EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF EVERY SINGLE DAY! AND WHAT ABOUT THE POTHOLES IN THE PARKING LOT? WHERE'S THE MONEY COMING FOR THAT? IF MY GOING ON CAMERA CAN GET THE JOB DONE, I SAY LET'S DO IT. MARK'S BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO OFFER HIS SERVICE AS A SPOKESMAN. NOW, I, UH... I DON'T WANT TO RAIN ON ANYBODY ELSE'S PARADE. - NO PROBLEM. - YOU WILL, OF COURSE, ALSO BE THERE. SURE. GOOD. GREAT. BY THE WAY, DONALD, UH, WHAT'LL YOU BE WEARING? - OH, SOMETHING SIMPLE. - RIGHT. I HAVE A NAVY BLUE TIE, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. THAT'D BE PERFECT. I APPRECIATE IT. MY PLEASURE. I'LL BE GOING RED. SO YOU'RE BLOWING OUT OF THIS JOINT, HUH? MY MOTHER. I KNEW SHE'D CAUSE TROUBLE. GOD, THE PROBLEMS. THERE ALWAYS ARE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I WANT, WHAT I THINK. IT'S ALWAYS BEST FOR ME. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I TOLD HER... I'M NOT LEAVING. IF SHE WANTS ME OUT, SHE CAN CALL AN AMBULANCE, PUT ME IN A STRAITJACKET, DRAG ME OUT... BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I'M LEAVING. LOOK, SANDY. WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT? SO LET'S TALK STRAIGHT TO EACH OTHER. YOUR MOTHER DIDN'T COME UP HERE TO GIVE YOU A HARD TIME. SHE DIDN'T. SHE CAME UP HERE BECAUSE SHE LOVES YOU AND CARES ABOUT YOU. SHE THINKS, LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE, THAT NEWER AND BIGGER IS BETTER. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BETTER, BUT BOSTON GENERAL'S CERTAINLY NEWER AND BIGGER. YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE MY MOM WANTS YOU TO. NO, I SAY IT 'CAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH. I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME. I DO. WHETHER YOU LEAVE TODAY OR A WEEK FROM NOW, I'VE DONE ALL I CAN DO FOR YOU. SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME TO LEAVE? MM-HMM. OKAY. THEN I WILL. YOU'RE NOT LEAVING TILL TOMORROW. I'LL STOP IN AND SEE YOU BEFORE I LEAVE. GET BACK IN BED. UH, NINA MORRISON, PLEASE. NO, I KNOW. I KNOW. SHE'S A STRINGER. SHE LEFT A MESSAGE TO CALL HER AT THE CITY DESK. I DON'T KNOW. THE MESSAGE JUST SAID... UH... NINA MORRISON. ALL RIGHT, LOOK. JUST TELL HER THAT JACK, HER HUSBAND, CALLED... AND I'M ON AGAIN TONIGHT. THANK YOU. GARY AND I WERE GOING TOGETHER FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS. I WAS REALLY CRAZY ABOUT HIM. LUCKY STIFF. HE WAS INTO PATHOLOGY, AND SINCE I WAS INTO GARY, NATURALLY I GOT INTO PATHOLOGY. NATURALLY. I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING THOUGH. I'M NOT GOING OUT WITH PEOPLE I WORK WITH ANYMORE. I GUESS IT KIND OF MAKES IT HARD TO CARRY ON A CONVERSATION. I MEAN WITH PATHOLOGISTS. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE VERY SWEET, WAYNE. AND YOU HAVE REALLY NICE EYES. THANKS. THEY'RE LITHUANIAN. YOU KNOW, THIS SOUNDS WEIRD, BUT I HAVEN'T KISSED A MAN SINCE GARY DIED... EXCEPT FOR HIS FATHER AT THE FUNERAL. I'D REALLY LIKE YOU TO KISS ME. WOULD THAT BE ALL RIGHT? YEAH, I THINK THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT. WAIT. NOT HERE. ALL RIGHT. WAYNE. YOU'RE A SICK MAN, FISCUS. VERY SICK. LISTEN, ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, WHAT I DID... I JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE. I HAD NO RIGHT. I LOST IT. I'VE BEEN WORKING TOO HARD. TELL ME ABOUT IT. WHAT? I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU. I'VE HAD IT WITH THE PATIENTS, WITH THE STAFF. I'VE HAD IT. I HAVE NO PRIVACY. EVERYBODY MAKES DEMANDS... THE NURSES, PATIENTS, PATIENT'S FAMILY. ANY TIME OF THE DAY OR NIGHT. THAT PATIENT'S GOT A LITTLE NAUSEA, A LITTLE CONSTIPATION... HE WANTS ME. HE EXPECTS ME. WELL, FINE. ANYBODY CAN HANDLE THAT 12 HOURS A DAY. BUT YOU START RACKING IT UP, DAY AFTER DAY... YOU'RE ON EVERY THIRD OR FOURTH DAY FOR 36 HOURS. AND I GO TO SLEEP IN MY ROOM AND I LIE DOWN. AND I'M IN MY DREAM. AND SOMEBODY BEEPS ME FOR MR. JONES... WHO I NEVER SAW IN MY LIFE. AND HE WANTS SOMETHING FOR NAUSEA, OR HIS PAIN ISN'T QUITE IN CONTROL... OR WHATEVER IT IS! IT STARTS WEARING ON YOU! IT'S, LIKE... LEAVE ME ALONE! WHY CAN'T I HAVE MY PRIVACY? WHY CAN'T I EAT MY MEAL IN PEACE? WHY MUST I ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE? CONSTANTLY! I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO MY WIFE IS ANYMORE! I NEVER SEE HER. SHE'S SLEEPING WHEN I COME HOME AT NIGHT, I SAY GOOD-BYE IN THE MORNING. YOU VIOLATE MY TERRITORY. YOU VIOLATE MY EARS. YOU VIOLATE MY PRIVACY. STILL HERE, DR. WESTPHALL? HERE TODAY, HERE TOMORROW. THEY GOT A CARD GAME GOING IN THE SECOND FLOOR LOUNGE, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. NO, THANKS. I HAVE TO SEE THE KIDS. YOU SHOULD GET A WIFE, DR. WESTPHALL. I HAD ONE. ONE DIES, YOU SHOULD GET ANOTHER ONE. GOOD NIGHT, ERMA. GOOD NIGHT. PLEASE COME TO X-RAY, MISS VOCKER. GOOD NIGHT. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
