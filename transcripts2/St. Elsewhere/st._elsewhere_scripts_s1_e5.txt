IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S TIME. DID YOU CALL YOUR NEIGHBOR, MRS. DEJESUS? OKAY. GIVE ME THE NUMBER, AND I'LL CALL HER, AND I'LL CALL YOU RIGHT BACK. I'D ALSO LIKE TO TIP MY HAT TO WILFRED SLOAN, MY ORGANIC CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR AT PENN, AN INSPIRED EDUCATOR, AND A HUMANIST, WHO INSTILLED IN ME THE DESIRE FOR EXCELLENCE, AND WHO IS, I'M HAPPY TO SAY, ALIVE AND WELL, 88 YEARS OLD IN PHILADELPHIA.

EVERYBODY IN BOSTON IS IN COLLEGE. B.U. I'M A THEATER ARTS MAJOR. AH, THE STAGE. IT'S A VERY HONORABLE PROFESSION. MY WIFE WAS AN ACTRESS. YOU'RE MARRIED. WAS. A LONG TIME AGO. I WAS IN DARTMOUTH, AND CYNTHIA WAS AT HOLYOKE. AND WE FELL IN LOVE AND GOT MARRIED. CYNTHIA ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT I DID IT TO BEAT THE DRAFT. DID YOU? NO. I WENT TO MED SCHOOL TO BEAT THE DRAFT. UCLA. SEE, CYNTHIA WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS. SO WE MOVED TO LOS ANGELES. AND, UH, I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CHAD EVERETT. IT'S A HELL OF A PLACE. BARTENDER! HOW DID YOU GET BACK TO BOSTON? I TOOK THE RED-EYE. IT'S A STOLI ON THE ROCKS WITH A TWIST. I REMEMBER. AND, PLEASE, REMEMBER TO MAKE IT A DOUBLE. AND, UH, ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE FOR THE LADY. ANYWAY, I'M, UH, WORKING MY TAIL OFF IN MED SCHOOL, AND CYNTHIA FOUND SOMEONE MORE ARTISTIC THAN ME. SHE THOUGHT THE KARMA WAS BETTER. A LOT OF KARMA GOING AROUND IN 1970. DO YOU THINK, UH... DO YOU THINK DIRECTING TELEVISION IS ARTISTIC? DO YOU WANNA SEE HER PICTURE? SURE. IT'S, UH... IT'S A LITTLE ON THE OLD SIDE. SHE'S PRETTY. MM-HMM. IS THAT YOUR SON? WILLIAM. BILLY. NAMED AFTER MY DAD. CYNTHIA WAS LEANING TOWARDS, UH, "EUGENE." YOU KNOW, AS IN McCARTHY. OR "FREEDOM," AS IN AMERICA. BUT I FIGURED, WHY GIVE THAT KID A REASON FOR A FISTFIGHT... EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. WHAT A SWEET BABY. DOES HE LIVE WITH HIS MOTHER? WELL, CYNTHIA GOT VERY PARANOID LIVING IN L.A. IT DOES THAT TO YOU. UM... I DON'T KNOW. MANSON WAS ON THE LOOSE. SHE BOUGHT A .44 MAGNUM. YOU KNOW, KEPT IT IN HER BEDSIDE TABLE. MUST HAVE BEEN A CLINT EASTWOOD FAN, RIGHT? AND, UH, BILLY FOUND IT ONE DAY AND... BLEW A HOLE THE SIZE OF A SOFTBALL IN HIS CHEST. IT'S A VERY... STUPID WAY FOR A LITTLE BOY TO DIE. I'M SORRY. CYNTHIA THOUGHT IT HAPPENED BECAUSE I DIDN'T GO TO VIETNAM AND DIE. SHE BEGAN TO GET VERY WEIRD. I MEAN, THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE, ISN'T IT? I MEAN, WHETHER IT'S CANCER OR NAPALM OR A SAFE FALLIN' ON YOU, WE'RE ALL... OUT HERE ALONE, DODGING THE BULLETS. EXCEPT FOR BILLY-BOY, WHO DIDN'T KNOW ENOUGH TO DUCK. A TOAST... TO ROBBY DURANT... ANOTHER POOR SOUL THAT NEVER KNEW WHAT HIT HIM. WHO'S ROBBY DURANT? A FRIEND. WELL, DRINK UP, LASS. BARTENDER! ANOTHER ROUND. I THINK YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO CUT YOU OFF. THEN I GUESS IT'S TIME TO GO HOME. AND DON'T THINK ABOUT DRIVING. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. YOU... COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
