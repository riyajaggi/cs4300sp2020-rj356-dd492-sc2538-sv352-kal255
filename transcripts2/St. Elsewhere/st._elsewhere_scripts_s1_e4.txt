THE RIGHTS OF ALL OPPRESSED PEOPLE TO OVERTHROW THEIR OPPRESSORS. - AS IN INNOCENT PEOPLE IN A BANK? - NOBODY IS INNOCENT. THAT'S A RATHER CONSERVATIVE POINT OF VIEW FOR A RADICAL, DON'T YOU THINK? THEN AGAIN, AS A PRODUCT... OF A TRADITIONAL, ADVANTAGED FAMILY, IT ISN'T SURPRISING THAT YOU HAVE SUCH A SINGULAR VIEW. WE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM. WE WANT TO BLOW IT UP... SCHOOLS, AIRPORTS, BUS STATIONS, BANKS... - THEY'RE ALL THE SAME. - I TAKE IT YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE? AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN. AND AGAIN. YOU LACK A GOOD, HEALTHY FEAR OF LIFE, ANDREW. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO EASY FOR YOU TO TAKE THE LIVES OF OTHERS. YOU HAVE BEEN SHELTERED AND PROTECTED FOR SO LONG... THAT YOU FEEL INVINCIBLE. WELL, THAT SENSE OF INVINCIBILITY... IS AN ILLUSION.

THAT DAMN CHARLEY HIT ME WITH A BOTTLE. DON'T YOU HAVE THE SENSE TO RUN? DIDN'T HURT MUCH. THEY TAKE YOUR BLOOD. THEY PUT IT IN BOTTLES... AND THEY SELL IT, CORIE. THAT'S NOT BLOOD, ARNIE. THAT'S MEDICINE. DOCTOR SAID I'M VERY SICK, ARNIE. DR. NICE EYES SAID MY FEET GOTTA BE CUT OFF. MY FEET ARE DEAD AND THEY'RE JUST POISONING MY LEGS. YOU UNDERSTAND ME? THIS IS WHAT THEY DO, CORIE.

WHAT'S THE VERDICT? WELL, OUR TESTS INDICATE... YOU'RE A PERFECTLY HEALTHY 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL. - SHE'S OKAY? - WE CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG, - EXCEPT THAT YOU NEED GLASSES. - OH, I KNOW. AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY YOU PASSED OUT. MY ADVICE TO YOU IS THAT YOU SEE YOUR FAMILY DOCTOR AS SOON AS YOU GET HOME. WE'LL SEND HIM OUR RESULTS, AND HE'LL PROBABLY GIVE YOU A STRESS TEST... AND PUT YOU ON A CARDIAC TREADMILL. MORE TESTS? MORE TESTS. WELL, I CERTAINLY MADE A MESS OF OUR VACATION. NONSENSE. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAT YOU'RE OKAY. LET'S JUST THINK OF IT AS... AN ADVENTURE? RIGHT. CAN I HELP YOU? LILLIAN ROGERS... CHECKING OUT. TAKES JUST A MOMENT. THIS IS YOUR BILL. - OH, MY GOD. - WHAT, GEORGE? YOU'RE KIDDING. $1,380.90? LOOKS FINE TO ME. 1,300... THERE GOES MY PEWTER. I THINK I'M GOING TO BE SICK. LUCKY FOR YOU YOUR WIFE WASN'T. DR. TYNAN TO OBSTETRICS. DR. TYNAN TO OBSTETRICS. CORA? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? HOME. CORA, YOU CAN'T LEAVE. ARNIE, GO WAIT OVER THERE FOR ME. NO, IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. I'M ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD. IT'S ALL RIGHT. LOOK. YOU'RE A NICE GUY AND I KNOW THIS HURTS YOUR FEELINGS... NO, MY FEELINGS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE INFECTION SPREADS. I UNDERSTAND. YOUR FEET HAVE TO BE AMPUTATED. COME HERE. I CAN'T BE LYING AROUND UP HERE. I GOT A HOMELIFE. I GOTTA TAKE CARE OF HIM. LOOK AT YOUR FEET, CORA. YOU CAN BARELY WALK. I CAN WALK FINE. ARNIE'S NOT GONNA BE PUT BACK IN ANY DAMN INSTITUTION, YOU HEAR ME? IF YOU DON'T GET TREATMENT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE OUT THE YEAR. MY MOTHER SWORE I'D NEVER SEE 30.

AND I HAVE MADE EVERY KIND OF MISTAKE A WOMAN CAN MAKE. AND THE ONLY THING I GOT... THAT LOVES ME... IS THAT MAN. WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF HIM WHILE I'M LYING AROUND HERE GETTING RENOVATED? BESIDES, THESE DEAD OLD FEET ARE MORE BOTHER TO YOU THAN THEY ARE TO ME. SO I THINK I'LL KEEP 'EM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'LL DIE. MAYBE YOU'RE WRONG. YOU EVER THINK OF THAT? I'M NOT WRONG. WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT, IT'S NO BIG LOSS. YOU CAN STILL CHANGE YOUR MIND. MAYBE I WILL. MAYBE I WILL. THEY OUGHT TO PUT A WRECKING BALL TO THIS PLACE. IT'S A DUMP. I'D BE DOING YOU A FAVOR IF I BLEW IT UP. HEY, UH, SAMBO. TAKE IT NICE AND SLOW. I WANNA ENJOY THE VIEW. HEY, WHERE IS THE JAIL WARD, ANYWAY? UP OR DOWN? HEY, DON'T WORRY. NOBODY'S GONNA BUST ME OUT OF YOUR JAIL WARD. NOBODY HAS TO. UGLY! NO!
