THE RIGHTS OF ALL OPPRESSED PEOPLE TO OVERTHROW THEIR OPPRESSORS. - AS IN INNOCENT PEOPLE IN A BANK? - NOBODY IS INNOCENT. THAT'S A RATHER CONSERVATIVE POINT OF VIEW FOR A RADICAL, DON'T YOU THINK? THEN AGAIN, AS A PRODUCT... OF A TRADITIONAL, ADVANTAGED FAMILY, IT ISN'T SURPRISING THAT YOU HAVE SUCH A SINGULAR VIEW. WE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM. WE WANT TO BLOW IT UP... SCHOOLS, AIRPORTS, BUS STATIONS, BANKS... - THEY'RE ALL THE SAME. - I TAKE IT YOU'VE DONE THIS BEFORE? AND I'LL DO IT AGAIN. AND AGAIN. YOU LACK A GOOD, HEALTHY FEAR OF LIFE, ANDREW.

YOUR FEET HAVE TO BE AMPUTATED, CORA. OTHERWISE THE INFECTIOUS PROCESS WILL CONTINUE, AND THE GANGRENE WILL SPREAD. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE WE CAN DO TO STOP IT. YOU UNDERSTAND, CORA? SURE. SURE. I WISH THERE... OH... DR. NICE EYES... HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME. CORA CAN TAKE A PUNCH. IT'S OKAY. DR. ZELIG, 5-2-1-6. DR. ZELIG, 5-2-1-6. - WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT? - KATHERINE McALLISTER'S DEAD.

I WENT TO THE SHELTER. I WENT TO LOOK FOR FRANKIE. HE OWES ME A DOLLAR. HE PAY YOU? NO, HE SAID MAYBE TOMORROW. YEAH, SURE. WHO SMACKED YOU? HUH? WHO SMACKED YOU? YOU GOT A BIG THING ON YOUR HEAD. THAT DAMN CHARLEY HIT ME WITH A BOTTLE. DON'T YOU HAVE THE SENSE TO RUN? DIDN'T HURT MUCH. THEY TAKE YOUR BLOOD. THEY PUT IT IN BOTTLES... AND THEY SELL IT, CORIE. THAT'S NOT BLOOD, ARNIE. THAT'S MEDICINE. DOCTOR SAID I'M VERY SICK, ARNIE. DR. NICE EYES SAID MY FEET GOTTA BE CUT OFF. MY FEET ARE DEAD AND THEY'RE JUST POISONING MY LEGS. YOU UNDERSTAND ME? THIS IS WHAT THEY DO, CORIE.

PLEASE, CORIE? PLEASE, LET'S GO HOME. THEY'RE GONNA CUT OFF MY FEET! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND ANYTHING? YOU CAN'T GO RUNNING AROUND LIKE A CHICKEN WITHOUT A HEAD, BECAUSE I CAN'T CHASE AFTER YOU NO MORE. I COULD HAVE RUN. I COULD HAVE RUN. ARNIE? GO TELL THE NURSE TO GIVE YOU MY THINGS. AND SCARE HER IF SHE DON'T. KISSINGER SAID IT WAS POWER, THE MARQUIS DE SADE FAVORED WHIPS AND CHAINS, SAMUELS CLAIMS IT'S A 30-TO-1 SHOT AT SUFFOLK DOWNS... AND SPEAKING FOR MYSELF AND THE URBAN PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE, THE GREATEST APHRODISIAC IN THE HISTORY OF MAN... IS HIGH HEELS. BALONEY. THAT RANKS SECOND. THOUGHT GUYS LIKE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE TOUGH. IT BARELY PENETRATED YOUR MUSCLE. THE SURGEON SAID HE COULD HAVE PULLED IT OUT WITH HIS FINGERS. GOIN' BACK TO JAIL BECAUSE OF YOU, MAN. SO IT'S MY FAULT NOW YOU GOT SHOT? SOCIETY'S NO LONGER TO BLAME? IF YOU HADN'T HAVE GOT ME SO EXCITED, I COULD HAVE MADE IT. YEAH, TO YOUR CAR, MAYBE. I THINK THEY MUST HAVE SHOT ME THROUGH THE WINDOW. HANGING AROUND WITH THE WRONG CROWD. SO WHAT DO YOU DO ANYHOW, HUH? SECRET AGENT, RIGHT? - YEAH. SECRET AGENT. - SEE YOU LATER. WHO'S WINNING? I AM. WHAT'S THE VERDICT? WELL, OUR TESTS INDICATE... YOU'RE A PERFECTLY HEALTHY 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL. - SHE'S OKAY? - WE CAN'T FIND ANYTHING WRONG, - EXCEPT THAT YOU NEED GLASSES. - OH, I KNOW. AND WE DON'T KNOW WHY YOU PASSED OUT. MY ADVICE TO YOU IS THAT YOU SEE YOUR FAMILY DOCTOR AS SOON AS YOU GET HOME. WE'LL SEND HIM OUR RESULTS, AND HE'LL PROBABLY GIVE YOU A STRESS TEST... AND PUT YOU ON A CARDIAC TREADMILL. MORE TESTS? MORE TESTS. WELL, I CERTAINLY MADE A MESS OF OUR VACATION. NONSENSE. IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAT YOU'RE OKAY. LET'S JUST THINK OF IT AS... AN ADVENTURE? RIGHT. CAN I HELP YOU? LILLIAN ROGERS... CHECKING OUT. TAKES JUST A MOMENT. THIS IS YOUR BILL. - OH, MY GOD. - WHAT, GEORGE? YOU'RE KIDDING. $1,380.90? LOOKS FINE TO ME. 1,300... THERE GOES MY PEWTER. I THINK I'M GOING TO BE SICK. LUCKY FOR YOU YOUR WIFE WASN'T. DR. TYNAN TO OBSTETRICS. DR. TYNAN TO OBSTETRICS. CORA? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? HOME. CORA, YOU CAN'T LEAVE. ARNIE, GO WAIT OVER THERE FOR ME. NO, IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. I'M ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD. IT'S ALL RIGHT. LOOK. YOU'RE A NICE GUY AND I KNOW THIS HURTS YOUR FEELINGS... NO, MY FEELINGS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THE INFECTION SPREADS. I UNDERSTAND. YOUR FEET HAVE TO BE AMPUTATED. COME HERE. I CAN'T BE LYING AROUND UP HERE. I GOT A HOMELIFE. I GOTTA TAKE CARE OF HIM. LOOK AT YOUR FEET, CORA. YOU CAN BARELY WALK. I CAN WALK FINE. ARNIE'S NOT GONNA BE PUT BACK IN ANY DAMN INSTITUTION, YOU HEAR ME? IF YOU DON'T GET TREATMENT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE OUT THE YEAR. MY MOTHER SWORE I'D NEVER SEE 30.

AND I HAVE MADE EVERY KIND OF MISTAKE A WOMAN CAN MAKE. AND THE ONLY THING I GOT... THAT LOVES ME... IS THAT MAN. WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF HIM WHILE I'M LYING AROUND HERE GETTING RENOVATED? BESIDES, THESE DEAD OLD FEET ARE MORE BOTHER TO YOU THAN THEY ARE TO ME. SO I THINK I'LL KEEP 'EM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YOU'LL DIE. MAYBE YOU'RE WRONG. YOU EVER THINK OF THAT? I'M NOT WRONG. WELL, IF YOU'RE NOT, IT'S NO BIG LOSS. YOU CAN STILL CHANGE YOUR MIND. MAYBE I WILL. MAYBE I WILL. THEY OUGHT TO PUT A WRECKING BALL TO THIS PLACE. IT'S A DUMP. I'D BE DOING YOU A FAVOR IF I BLEW IT UP. HEY, UH, SAMBO. TAKE IT NICE AND SLOW. I WANNA ENJOY THE VIEW. HEY, WHERE IS THE JAIL WARD, ANYWAY? UP OR DOWN? HEY, DON'T WORRY. NOBODY'S GONNA BUST ME OUT OF YOUR JAIL WARD. NOBODY HAS TO. UGLY! NO!
