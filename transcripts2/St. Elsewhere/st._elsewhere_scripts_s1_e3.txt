 NEXT. IN THIS BIOPSY, WE SEE THE ADENOCARCINOMA... IS CONSISTENT WITH THE METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE STOMACH. NEXT. HERE, WE HAVE A FOCUS OF FAT NECROSIS. NOTE THAT SOME OF THE NUCLEI HAVE DISAPPEARED... AND THE CELL WALLS ARE BLURRED. WHO TOOK THESE PICTURES, JAMES GARNER? MAY I HAVE THE LIGHTS, PLEASE? ALL RIGHT. YOU. WHAT DO I TELL MISS TAYLOR? I'M NOT SURE. THAT SHOULD EASE HER MIND. ANYONE ELSE? TELL HER THE TRUTH. AND WHAT EXACTLY IS THE TRUTH, DR. ARMSTRONG? SHE'S DYING. WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE THE ONE TO TELL HER? SHE HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW. I WILL IF I HAVE TO. VERY GOOD. AND ARE YOU GOING TO TELL HER WHEN SHE'S GONNA DIE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, IS SHE GONNA DIE TOMORROW MORNING, OR IS SHE GONNA DIE NEXT WEEK? NEXT MONTH? NEXT YEAR? I DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW. IT WOULD SEEM THAT MISS TAYLOR IS IN THE SAME PREDICAMENT WE ALL ARE. WE KNOW THAT SOMEDAY WE'RE GONNA DIE. WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHEN. WHAT I'M SAYING, DR. AUSCHLANDER... I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, DR. ARMSTRONG. I'M QUESTIONING HOW YOU WOULD SAY IT. LET'S ALL THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN WE MEET WITH MISS TAYLOR. WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE AUSCHLANDER AROUND TO DISCUSS THIS CASE. YEAH, IT'S LIKE MARIE ANTOINETTE TALKING ABOUT THE INNER MECHANISMS OF THE GUILLOTINE. NO, NO, NO. FRANCO'S DOING FINE. WHAT ABOUT MR. BERMAN? DID HE HAVE A GOOD NIGHT? ARE YOU KIDDING? HE WAS BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS LIKE A PING-PONG BALL YELLING FOR VALIUM. I TOLD HIM YESTERDAY IT WAS THE VALIUM THAT WAS MAKING HIM HYPERSENSITIVE. SOMETIMES, WE SUFFER FROM A KIND OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AROUND HERE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WELL, THE DOCTORS, THE NURSES, THE STAFF... WE THINK OF THIS HOSPITAL AS A PLACE TO WORK. AND THE INTERNS, THE RESIDENTS... THEY WANT IT TO BE A PLACE TO LEARN, OF COURSE. AND THE COMMUNITY ALTERNATES BETWEEN THINKING OF IT... AS A RENAISSANCE CATHEDRAL OR FRANKENSTEIN'S CASTLE. THERE'S TALK AMONG THE BOARD ABOUT CLOSING THIS FACILITY... AND MOVING ST. ELIGIUS TO ONE OF THE BETTER SUBURBS, LIKE NEWTON OR WELLESLEY. JUDGE, I'M WELL AWARE OF WHY YOU'RE HERE TODAY. THAT KIND OF TALK HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE IDEA? NO, I DON'T. ST. ELIGIUS IS PART OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. IT'S LIKE OLD MRS. WEBER, THE CROSSING GUARD AT POGANSETT SCHOOL, OR THAT RUSTY FOUNTAIN IN JOHN ADAMS SQUARE. YOU CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY WITHOUT LEAVING A HOLE. DR. OSTERWALD, GOOD MORNING. MM-HMM. I WOULDN'T WANT THAT GUY EXAMINING ME. TOO BAD. HE'S THE BEST CARDIOLOGIST IN NEW ENGLAND. YEAH? SO WHAT HAPPENED? I CALLED SANITATION. WELL, THEY DIDN'T HEAR YOU. WE HAD ANOTHER KID IN HERE LAST NIGHT. TWELVE YEARS OLD. ALL RIGHT, I'LL CALL 'EM AGAIN. YEAH, MAKE SURE YOU DO. DAMN HOSPITAL! ANGRY YOUNG MAN. YES, THAT'S ROONEY. HE'S AN ORDERLY. YOU LET AN ORDERLY TALK TO YOU LIKE THAT? HE'S TALKING ABOUT SYRINGES. YOU SEE, SANITATION CAN'T DISPOSE OF THEM FAST ENOUGH, AND THE KIDS PICK THEM UP AND USE THEM AGAIN. YOU MEAN THE CHILDREN ARE JUNKIES? AFRAID SO. NEXT TIME, TRY RINGING THE DOORBELL, HMM? YOU'VE GOT THAT TERRORIST GUY REINHARDT IN HERE, HAVEN'T YOU? RIGHT. AND THE WOMAN THAT WAS IN THE BANK WHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF? KATHERINE McALLISTER. HOW IS SHE? ALIVE. SHALL WE? LISTEN UP, BARBARA. I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU ANY MORE DEMEROL. I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU ANY MORE PERCODAN. IF YOU WANT DRUGS, THEN YOU JUST GO ON OUT ON THE STREET AND BUY 'EM LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DOES. THERE'S A CALL FOR YOU ON LINE TWO. IT'S YOUR WIFE. WHAT DOES SHE WANT? SHE WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT THE TICKET FOR THE LAUNDRY. WHAT TICKET? SHE'S YOUR WIFE, PAL. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. TOUCH ME AGAIN, YOU LITTLE CREEP, I'LL SMASH YOUR OTHER LEG! WILL THE OWNER OF THE BLUE FORD... BLOCKING THE AMBULANCE ENTRANCE MOVE IT IMMEDIATELY. THE OWNER OF A BLUE FORD, YOU'RE BLOCKING THE AMBULANCE ENTRANCE. MOVE IT IMMEDIATELY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT, FISCUS, BUT IF YOU COULD FREEZE-DRY IT, YOU'D BE RICH. WELL, COVER FOR ME TOMORROW, AND I'LL GIVE YOU THE SECRET. WHAT'S TOMORROW? CATHY AND I ARE GOING TO THE PISTOL RANGE. YOU'RE FANTASTIC. YOU'VE GOT A DATE WITH CATHY MARTIN, YOU'RE GOING TO THE PISTOL RANGE. SHE'S A SHARPSHOOTER. YEAH, I'LL BET SHE IS. VICTOR, I GOT A SECRET BETWEEN YOU AND ME, ALL RIGHT? ALL WE EVER DO IS HAVE SEX. IT'S SEX, SEX, SEX. MY HEART BLEEDS FOR YOU. SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT ME. I KEEP TELLING HER IT'S ONLY A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP AND NOTHING MORE. THAT'S GOOD. WOMEN ARE SUCKERS FOR INTEGRITY. I DON'T WANT HER TO GET TOO SERIOUS, OR IT'LL RUIN IT. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU, BETWEEN MY DOUBLE SHIFTS HERE AND HER, I'M DRAINED. KIND OF LIKE A MAPLE TREE AFTER SAP-SUCKING SEASON. YEAH, RIGHT. SURE. SO WHEN YOU SUGGESTED A MORE MUNDANE ACTIVITY, SHE SUGGESTED... THE PISTOL RANGE. EXACTLY. SEX AND VIOLENCE. IT'S THE AMERICAN WAY. WILL YOU COVER FOR ME? YOU GOT IT. THANKS A LOT. IT'S MY TURN! IT'S MY TURN! IT'S MY TURN! GIRLS, GIRLS, GIRLS. STOP THAT. WE'RE GONNA LEAVE FOR SCHOOL IN FIVE MINUTES, AND I WANT ALL THAT FOOD GONE. NOW, EAT. WHY DIDN'T MOM MAKE BREAKFAST? SHE'S, UH, SLEEPING LATE. IS SHE SICK? NO. THEN WHY'S SHE STILL SLEEPING? SHE'S GONNA HAVE A BABY. I KNOW THAT! A LITTLE BROTHER. RIGHT, DADDY? RIGHT. NOT NECESSARILY. GOOD MORNING. A BIG, STRONG BOY TO PROTECT YOU FROM, UH, ALL THE OTHER BIG, STRONG BOYS. RIGHT? HUNGRY? I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU. EVEN IF THIS ONE'S A GIRL, WE'RE STOPPING. I'M GETTIN' TOO OLD FOR THIS. - GIVE ME A "B." - "B!" WHAT IF THE TEST SAYS "GIRL"? GIVE ME AN "O." "O!" - STUBBORN. YOUR FATHER IS THE MOST STUBBORN MAN IN MASSACHUSETTS. AND GIVE ME A "Y." "Y!" - WHAT DOES IT SPELL? - BOY, BOY, BOY! HOW YOU DOIN'? I'M DR. BEALE. SOMEBODY JUST EXAMINED ME. I'M A PSYCHIATRIST. I DIDN'T ASK TO SEE YOU. NO, NO, YOU DID NOT. BUT I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE EITHER. YOU WANNA SEE IF I'M CRAZY? THAT'S WHAT THEY PAY ME FOR. HOW ARE YOU GONNA FIND OUT? WELL, I FIGURE THE BEST WAY... IS JUST TO COME OUT AND ASK YOU. - ARE YOU CRAZY? - ARE YOU? AS A LOON. WHY ELSE WOULD I BE A PSYCHIATRIST? OF COURSE, WE'RE A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO USE THE WORD "CRAZY." IT'S A LITTLE VAGUE, YOU KNOW. SAYS IN HERE THAT YOU'RE A PRETTY BRIGHT FELLA. HONOR STUDENT. TOP OF YOUR CLASS TILL YOU DROPPED OUT. - WHAT IS THE, UM, DOUGLAS STERNER AWARD? - SCIENCE. SCIENCE? WELL, THEN YOU AND ME, WE GOT SOMETHING IN COMMON, DON'T WE? I DOUBT IT. YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN SOMETHING GNAWING AT ME. MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME OUT. FOR CHRISTMAS, I GOT THIS SWEATER. HAD A V-NECK, 100% COTTON, SIZE LARGE. AND BY MISTAKE, MY CLEANING LADY, ERMA CASTRO, SHE PUT IT INTO THE WASHING MACHINE. WHEN I GOT IT OUT, I COULDN'T EVEN FIT IT OVER MY ARM. NOW, MY QUESTION IS, WHERE DID ALL THAT COTTON GO? YOU'RE A REAL DOWN-HOME GOOD OLD BOY, AREN'T YA? YEAH, I GUESS. YOU, UH... YOU PLAY CHESS, HUH? YEAH. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN PLAYIN' WITH A GUY NAMED DR. CRAIG. HE'S A SURGEON, AND THESE SURGEONS ONLY PLAY CHESS BUT A FEW WAYS. ONCE THEY GET SOMETHIN' STUCK IN THEIR HEAD, IT'S THERE FOREVER. YOU AND ME'LL PLAY. DR. PIG? I DON'T TRUST YOU AT ALL. YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT PARANOIDS MAKE THE VERY BEST CHESS PLAYERS, BECAUSE WITH EVERY MOVE, THEY NATURALLY ASSUME THAT THEIR OPPONENT IS OUT TO GET 'EM. IN THIS LAB, WE DO A LOT OF EXPERIMENTATION WITH ENDOCRINE THERAPY. PLAYING AROUND WITH HORMONES, SPEEDING UP THE RATE OF GROWTH, THAT SORT OF THING. IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING. OVER HERE, WE STUDY THE TISSUES THAT WE TAKE FROM THE ANIMALS. UM... HELLO. MESSAGE FROM UPSTAIRS. BELZNIK'S STARTING TO SNAP. SEEMS TO ME THIS TUBE SYSTEM'S A LITTLE OUT-OF-DATE. YES, WELL, IT'S THE ONLY WING THAT STILL HAS IT, JUDGE. WHEN WE GET SOME MORE MONEY... SAY NO MORE. SAY NO MORE. THANK YOU. HI. HI. WE USED TO GET THEM FROM THE POUND UNTIL THEY TOOK IT TO COURT. NOW WE'RE PAYING A SUPPLY HOUSE FOUR TIMES WHAT WE WERE DONATING TO THE S.P.C.A. DO YOU KILL THEM? SOME, YES. I HAVE THREE PEDIGREE SHOW DOGS. WELL, MRS. BEARDSLEY, THIS IS A HOSPITAL. PEOPLE RUN IT. PEOPLE ARE BORN HERE. THEY COME HERE WHEN THEY'RE HURT OR SICK. SOME DIE, AND SOME, WITH A LITTLE LUCK, GET BETTER. WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THESE POOR ANIMALS? DO YOU KNOW ANYONE WITH DIABETES? YES, MY SISTER-IN-LAW MARIAN. IT'S VERY LIKELY SHE WOULDN'T BE ALIVE TODAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE EXPERIMENTS... IN INSULIN THERAPY CONDUCTED IN LABS LIKE THIS USING DOGS. EVEN SO, THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY. IF YOU FIND ONE, WE'LL TRY IT. THERE YOU GO. BON VOYAGE. PLEASE SIT DOWN. BEFORE WE DID THE AMNIOCENTESIS, REMEMBER WE TALKED ABOUT THE KINDS OF THINGS WE'D BE LOOKING FOR... HOW THE FLUID AROUND THE FETUS WOULD INDICATE IF THERE WERE ANY METABOLIC ABNORMALITIES. WELL, WE DID FIND SOME ABNORMALITIES. WHAT'S WRONG? THE 21st CHROMOSOME SPLIT INTO THREE INSTEAD OF TWO. YOU SEE, THERE ARE 23 MATCHING PAIR... WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? IT MEANS THAT YOUR CHILD HAS DOWN'S SYNDROME. ARE YOU POSITIVE? YES. DOCTOR, UM, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. IN THIS TEST, ISN'T THERE... ISN'T THERE A LOT OF MARGIN FOR ERROR? BELIEVE ME, MR. WHITEHILL, I WOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU UNLESS I WAS SURE. WELL, I'M-I'M NOT SURE I... THE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS... HOW RETARDED WILL THE BABY BE? THAT'S HARD TO SAY EXACTLY. SOME DOWN'S CHILDREN LIVE WELL INTO THEIR 20s. BUT THEY ARE CHILDREN FOREVER. THE AVERAGE MENTAL AGE IS ABOUT SEVEN YEARS OLD, THOUGH SOME DO CONSIDERABLY BETTER. WILL THE BABY BE DEFORMED? THERE'S A HIGH RISK OF SOME SORT OF DEFORMITY. ARCHED PALATE, SLANTED EYES. GOD. I KNOW RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD. BUT DOWN'S CHILDREN ARE VERY HAPPY, VERY SPECIAL. MANY PARENTS FIND IMMENSE PLEASURE IN RAISING... PLEASURE? DR. CAVANERO, THE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS, WHAT CAUSED THIS? WE HAVE TWO PERFECTLY HEALTHY CHILDREN. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH EITHER OF YOU. IT'S NOT HEREDITARY. SOMETIMES, IT-IT JUST HAPPENS. UH, DR. CAVANERO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THINK, UM... THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE NUMBER OF A FRIEND OF MINE... WHO WORKS AT A GENETIC COUNSELING CENTER AT THE NORTH END. - WHAT SEX IS THE BABY? - IT'S A BOY. DID YOU HAVE A NICE VISIT FROM YOUR SISTER? YEAH. SHE BROUGHT YOU A NEW PERFUME. CALLED "NAUGHTY NIGHTS." VERY PLEASANT. FEEL HOW LOBULATED SHE IS. DOES THAT HURT? I AIN'T DEAF, AND I AIN'T SENILE EITHER. GENTLY, GENTLY, LIKE THIS. EASY. THAT'S IT. THERE WE ARE. NOW YOU. BREATHE IN, PLEASE. BREATHE OUT. THERE'S A VERTICAL SPAN OF ABOUT 20 CENTIMETERS. I SEE YOUR IVY'S THRIVING. SOMEBODY'S SNEAKING IN HERE WATERIN' THAT PLANT. ALL YOU YOUNG FOLKS GONNA BE DOCTORS? - WE ARE DOCTORS. - DON'T LOOK OLD ENOUGH. DON'T LET THEIR FRESHLY SCRUBBED FACES FOOL YOU. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING? DOC, I'VE BEEN SPITTIN' UP SOME GREEN STUFF. WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME MEDICINE TO CALM YOUR STOMACH. ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN GET YOU? YOU CAN LEAVE ONE OF THESE YOUNG, GOOD-LOOKING DOCTORS HERE. SEE YOU LATER. HER LIVER WAS HARD AS A ROCK. WHAT TREATMENT WOULD YOU SUGGEST? RADIATION THERAPY. IT MAY RELIEVE SOME TENSION, BUT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE LIMITED TO DOSES UNDER 2,000 RADS. WHAT ABOUT CHEMOTHERAPY? IT MAY ALSO BE USED IN APPROPRIATE BUT FUTILE DOSES. ANY OTHER IDEAS? WHAT ABOUT A PARTIAL RESECTION OF THE LIVER? SOME OF THE BEST ANSWERS, DR. MORRISON, DON'T COME FROM TEXTBOOKS. I THINK SHE KNOWS SHE'S GOING TO DIE. WE CAN TRY TO MAKE HER AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE. WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO? HI, GOOD-LOOKIN'. HOW'S MY SWEETHEART? 'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE, YOU KNOW... MY SWEETHEART. IT SNOWED LAST NIGHT IN MINNEAPOLIS. IT DID. SO WE'RE GONNA GET THOSE SKIS, THE BROSLAMS, AND WE'RE GONNA CROSS-COUNTRY ALL THE WAY TO BEAR LAKE. ONLY THIS TIME, WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE BRANDY. SO I WAS THE ONLY 12-YEAR-OLD... ♪♪ IN THE COUNCIL BLUFFS, IOWA LITTLE LEAGUE... THAT COULD BAT A THOUSAND AND READ HEBREW. SIMULTANEOUSLY? CAUTERY. MORE SPONGES. MY BROTHER ENJOYED LIVING ON THE DAIRY FARM. LOVED THOSE COWS. MARRIED A WOMAN NAMED BOSSIE... FROM A VERY ORTHODOX FAMILY. NOW OWNS A BULL BANK IN CAMBRIDGE. LISTEN, IF EITHER OF YOU'D LIKE A SHOT AT THIS... IT'S VERY SIMPLE. IT'S A LITTLE LIKE, UM, SLICING CHEESE. DON'T YOU FIND THE MUSIC DISTRACTING? ONLY MAC DAVIS. EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR, BUT WHAT'S A BULL BANK? HE SELLS BULL SPERM TO UNSUSPECTING HEIFERS. FORCEPS. IT'S A LITTLE LIKE A COMPUTER DATING SERVICE. CAUTERY. YOU WANNA TURN THAT UP A HAIR? YOU THINK WHILE WE'RE DOWN HERE, I SHOULD GIVE HIM A VASECTOMY? SPECIMEN JAR. AH, NO PROBLEM. PLENTY MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. MY NEXT GUEST IS A DOUBLE HERNIA. BUT FIRST, THIS WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR. ARE YOU SERIOUS? WOULD YOU RATHER HE SPENT THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN AN INSTITUTION? WE COULD TAKE CARE OF HIM HERE. OH, YEAH. YEAH, WE KNOW A LOT ABOUT RAISING A DAMAGED CHILD. WE COULD LEARN. TEACH ALL THE BABYSITTERS TOO? OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT. LOOK, IT'S JUST WRONG TO BRING A CHILD INTO THIS WORLD WITH THAT MANY DISADVANTAGES. LIFE IS HARD ENOUGH. WHO SAYS WE GET TO CHOOSE FOR HIM? MY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO THIS FAMILY. IT'S NOT FAIR TO STEPHANIE AND MICHELLE. THE GIRLS'LL HELP HIM. ARE YOU KIDDING? AT BEST, THEY'RE GONNA BE SCARED OF HIM. AT WORST, THEY'RE GONNA HATE HIM FOR BEING SO SLOW. I DON'T THINK SO. I WANNA HEAR YOU EXPLAIN TO THEM WHY THEIR LITTLE BROTHER'S A MONGOLOID. PLEASE DON'T USE THAT WORD. YOU'D BETTER GET USED TO IT. IT SO EASY FOR YOU TO JUST THROW IT AWAY. DO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S EASY FOR ME? BUT AN ABORTION... IT'S THE ONLY REASONABLE THING TO DO. CONSTANT HUMILIATION. THAT'S WHAT I LIVE WITH ALL DAY, EVERY DAY, FOR 25 YEARS. HE DIDN'T WANNA TAKE JOSIE TO ATLANTIC CITY. IT'S NOT HER FAULT SHE GOT CARSICK. HE DRIVES TOO FAST! SHE WOULDN'T RUIN THE SEAT COVERS. KEEP YOUR ARM STILL, PLEASE. I NEVER LIKED THAT CAR ANYWAY. 1958... BAD YEAR FOR BUICKS. POOR LITTLE JOSIE. SHE CAN'T EVEN DRINK OUT OF THE TOILET, NOT EVEN ONE TIME. KEEP YOUR ARM STILL, PLEASE. GOD! THAT DUMP WE LIVE IN... IT'S GOT ROTTEN PLUMBING. MAKES NOISE ALL NIGHT LONG. THUMP, CLANK, THUMP! I GET NO REST, NO PEACE. DO YOU SEE? MM-HMM. I DON'T LIKE DUST. BUT I DON'T WHINE ABOUT IT. CONSTANT HUMILIATION. JUST KEEP YOUR ARM STILL, PLEASE. GOD! I CAN'T DO ANYTHING RIGHT SINCE THEN, IF YOU LISTEN TO HIM! CONSTANT HUMILIATION! I KNOW HE'S GONNA SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE SHAMPOO. HE HATES IT. I KNOW IT. "NO CLEAN TOWELS! NO CLEAN SHEETS." CONST... YOU DON'T LIKE THE WAY I SMELL? - THE HELL WITH YOU! - GODDAMN IT! ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH. YOU JUST SIT THERE AND BE STILL. YOU UNDERSTAND ME? YOU SIT THERE AND YOU SHUT UP. I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T GET ALONG WITH HIM. YOU HEAR ME? I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS. I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR STUPID FIGHTS. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU? YOU'RE KILLING YOURSELF OVER COFFEE GRINDS AND TOOTHPASTE TUBES. AND THEN YOU COME IN HERE LOOKIN' FOR HELP, NOT JUST ONCE, BUT EVERY WEEK. EVERY TIME YOU HAVE A FIGHT, YOU TRY TO KILL YOURSELF. THEN YOU COME IN HERE, AND WE FIX YOU UP. HE COMES DOWN HERE. THE TWO OF YOU MAKE UP UNTIL THE NEXT TIME YOU HAVE A FIGHT. THEN YOU TRY TO KILL YOURSELF AGAIN. PEOPLE DON'T LIVE LIKE THAT. - LOOK, I DON'T... - SHUT UP! I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR FISH TANK, AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR CLEAN TOWELS. YOU JUST SIT THERE AND SHUT UP. UH, PETER? MYRA'S ON THE PHONE. TELL HER YOU CAN'T FIND ME. TELL HER I'M NOT HERE. PETE... JUST DO ME THAT FAVOR, WILL YOU, PLEASE? OKAY? CUT THIS. OKAY, THERE. NOW, I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU IN HERE AGAIN UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY DYING. THE PROBLEM'S NOT YOUR HUSBAND, MRS. LAWSON. IT'S IN YOUR HEAD. YOU OUGHTA SEE A SHRINK OR SOMEBODY. MOMMY! MOMMY! MOMMY! OH, HONEY. WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S THE MATTER? HUH? I HAD A BAD DREAM. OH. WELL, EVERYTHING'S OKAY NOW. IT'S ALL OVER. COME ON. TAKE A... TAKE A DEEP BREATH. WANNA TELL ME ABOUT IT? SOMETIMES THAT MAKES IT GO AWAY. I DON'T REMEMBER ALL OF IT. WE WERE WALKING DOWN THE BEACH, AND I STOPPED TO TALK TO THE GIRAFFE. AND YOU AND DADDY GOT MAD AT ME... AND PICKED ME UP AND WERE GONNA THROW ME IN THE OCEAN. OH, WE LOVE YOU. WE'D NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. WHERE'D YOU GET SUCH A SILLY IDEA? WELL, YOU'RE GONNA THROW AWAY THE NEW BABY. OH, NO. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU TOO. OH! DADDY AND I LOVE YOU. WE WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING TO HURT YOU. I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE. THE FAMILY SENT ME A FRUIT BASKET. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? THE PATIENT DIED, SHIRLEY. HE DIED, AND THEY SENT ME A FRUIT BASKET. IT'S A LITTLE LATE IN THE WEEK FOR THE TUNA FISH. GOOD POINT. HEY, YOU. WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, AT HOME? SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO VERIFY THE DATES SHE WAS ADMITTED AND DISCHARGED. AND THEN SHE SAID, "CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT I WAS IN FOR?" WELL, IT TURNED OUT HER HUSBAND HAD USED HER BLUE CROSS-BLUE SHIELD NUMBER... TO PAY FOR HIS GIRLFRIEND'S APPENDECTOMY. $1.18? ALL I HAD WAS A PEACH YOGURT AND A CHOCOLATE BAR. THEY SAY MEDICINE'S A RIP-OFF. I'VE JUST BEEN SO STUPID THIS YEAR. I USED ALL MY SICK DAYS FOR SICKNESS. IS ANDREW REINHARDT YOUR PATIENT NOW? YEAH. HOW'D YOU PUT UP WITH HIM? "SHAMASH"? SHAMASH. SOUNDS LIKE A KOSHER SANDWICH. WHAT'S IT MEAN? WELL, UM, SHAMASH... BE THE SUN GOD OF ASSYRIA. YEAH, SUN GOD OF ASSYRIA. TWENTY-THREE POINTS. I'VE HAD ENOUGH. I HATE TO TELL YOU THIS, V.J., BUT I THINK YOU'RE SUFFERING... FROM AN ACUTE CASE OF LEXICOGRAPHY. SURE, A FEW OF THEM DIE. BUT LOOK HOW MANY DROP DEAD... WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM THEIR DOCTORS. THOUGH, TO BE TOTALLY FRANK, THE YOUNG RESIDENT TODAY IS A COMPLETE KLUTZ. I MEAN, IN MY DAY, WE WERE TAUGHT ETHICS, CODES OF BEHAVIOR, RESPECT FOR SENIORITY. WHAT DO YOU GOT TODAY? YOU GOT DOCTORS WITH GYM SHOES. GYM SHOES, FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, AS IF WE WERE RUNNING A TRACK MEET INSTEAD OF A HOSPITAL. AM I RIGHT, HUGH? OH, YOU KNOW HOW I HATE TO DISAGREE WITH YOU, MARK. BRIAN'S OLDER BROTHER, DAVID, IS DEAD, AND HIS OTHER BROTHER, WELL, HE'LL NEVER GET MARRIED. WELL, HE'S ALWAYS WANTED A SON TO CARRY ON THE FAMILY NAME. DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN, DR. CAVANERO? NO, I'M NOT MARRIED. ANY BROTHERS OR SISTERS? YES. ONE BROTHER, FOUR SISTERS. WELL, I WAS AN ONLY CHILD. WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, I ALWAYS WANTED LOTS OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS. I SWORE THAT WHEN I GOT MARRIED, I'D HAVE FIVE OF EACH. WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE IN MY PLACE? THAT'S REALLY NOT THE QUESTION HERE. I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY... I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT IN THIS SITUATION, ADVICE IS EASY WHEN YOU'RE NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED. IT'S VERY COMPLICATED, ISN'T IT? WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOTHER? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT WOULD SHE HAVE DONE? MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE HAD THE BABY. BUT, THEN AGAIN, SHE'S A VERY TRADITIONAL WOMAN. SO AM I. WELL, EVENTUALLY, I WANNA BE A SCRUB NURSE. I KNOW. YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY A PUNK LIKE ME WANTS TO DO MORE THAN CLEAN UP AFTERBIRTH. NO. IT'S JUST THAT I'VE BEEN THINKING OF QUITTING. GOING TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL? GETTING OUT OF NURSING ALTOGETHER. WHY'S THAT? TOO MANY FORMS TO FILL OUT, TOO MANY HOSTILE PATIENTS, TOO MANY HOSTILE DOCTORS. AW, COME ON. IT AIN'T THAT BAD. MOST DOCTORS ARE RICH WHITE MEN WHO DON'T GIVE A DAMN... ABOUT MY FEELINGS OR OPINIONS. BESIDES, THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS A WOMAN CAN DO THESE DAYS. THINGS THAT PAY BETTER. ST. ELIGIUS EMERGENCY. OH, HELLO, MYRA. HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THESE PAINS?

YOU DIDN'T STOP TO THINK... THAT EVEN FOR A MINUTE, IT'S MY BODY THAT HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? THIS IS OUR LIFE. DOESN'T THAT COUNT FOR ANYTHING? DON'T BE STUPID. OF COURSE IT DOES. WELL, THEN IMAGINE THIS. EVERY DAY... EVERY DAMN DAY FOREVER... IT'S GONNA BE, "JOHNNY, DON'T PUT YOUR HAND ON THE STOVE. YOU'LL BURN YOURSELF." "DON'T PUT YOUR FINGER IN THE LIGHT SOCKET." "DON'T PEE-PEE IN YOUR PANTS." "DON'T"... I DON'T CARE. OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY NOW. I KNOW THE WAY I FEEL NOW. IT'S... IT'S THE SAME AS WHEN I WAS CARRYING STEPHANIE AND MICHELLE. WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY'D TURN OUT, OR WILL TURN OUT. WHAT IF STEPHANIE BECOMES AN AX MURDERER? WILL WE LOVE HER ANY LESS? NO, BECAUSE SHE'S OURS. WELL, SO IS HE. IT'S NOT THE SAME THING. STOP FOOLING YOURSELF. WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO ME? IF I WAS HIT BY A CAR AND BRAIN-DAMAGED FOR LIFE? OR STEPHANIE? OR MICHELLE? WHAT WOULD YOU DO, PACK US OFF TO AN INSTITUTION, OR SHOOT US IN THE BACKYARD? I KNOW YOU. I LOVE YOU. WHY CAN'T YOU LOVE THIS CHILD? IF I WANTED A PET... THIS IS OUR SON. THIS IS OUR MISTAKE. THIS IS A DEFECTIVE... ACCIDENT. MURDER. THAT'S WHAT IT IS, YOU KNOW. MURDER. YOU CAN CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT. BUT I CAN'T HANDLE THIS. CAN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, DENISE? I-I CAN'T DEAL WITH HAVING THIS CHILD. I DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH. HI. HI, WAYNE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? DOWN TO PATHOLOGY. THIS ELEVATOR'S GOING UP, CATHY. OH. I DO THAT ALL THE TIME.

NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. ELEVATORS MAKE ME NERVOUS ENOUGH WHEN THEY'RE MOVING. I FEEL SO STRANGE IN ELEVATORS. I NEVER KNOW WHERE TO LOOK. I KNOW. MY ELEVATOR ETIQUETTE ISN'T TOO GOOD EITHER. I ALWAYS THINK EVERYONE'S LOOKING AT ME, STARING AT ME, UNDRESSING ME WITH THEIR EYES. I DON'T THINK, UH, EVERYBODY DOES THAT. NOW WE'RE TRAPPED, WAYNE. IT MAY TAKE THEM HOURS TO DISCOVER US, LIKE THE BLACKOUT IN MANHATTAN, 1979. I WAS STUCK IN AN ELEVATOR AT THE BILTMORE... CATHY... WITH AN ARAB PRINCE AND FOUR LABRADORS. NO. TAKE IT EASY.

IT'S GONE NOW, AND IN ITS PLACE IS AN OFFICE BUILDING, ALL GLASS AND STEEL. SHINY MATERIAL. EVERY WEEK, WE'D GO TO THE MET, AND HE'D GET STANDING ROOM 'CAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR SEATS. MY FATHER AND I, EVERY WEEK, WE'D STAND AND WATCH PUCCINI, VERDI, MOZART, WAGNER. AND MY FATHER WOULD CRY. ONCE, I ASKED HIM, "WHY ARE YOU CRYING, PAPA?" AND HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID, "BE QUIET.
