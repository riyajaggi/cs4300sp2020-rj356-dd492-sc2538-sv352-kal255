 - TONIGHT ON ST. ELSEWHERE. - OKAY. HOW LONG? - THIRTY-FIVE MINUTES. - GIVE IT UP. TWO, THREE... SOMETHIN' FUNNY? - NO, SIR. - MR. ROECKLEIN, A YOUNG LADY JUST DIED IN HERE! YOU HAVE A ROTTEN SENSE OF TIMING. YOU KNOW THAT? IT'S GOING, "LUB-DUB, LUB-DUB." NO, NO, EHRLICH. IF THERE'S A MURMUR, IT WOULD BE, "LUB-SCHTUB, LUB-SCHTUB." OH, I SEE. "LUB-SCHTUB." DON'T YOU EVER, EVER QUESTION MY AUTHORITY AGAIN, LADY, OR I'LL SLAM THE DOOR SO HARD ON YOU, YOU WON'T KNOW WHAT HIT YOU. YOU'RE A GOOD DOCTOR, BUT YOU'RE AN INADEQUATE WOMAN.

 I KNOW IT. EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. YOU'VE GOT A COLD HEART. YOU CAN HAVE $300 FOR A NEW BEEPER, BUT WE CAN'T GET $20 FOR A DIAPER SERVICE. I'M TIRED OF IT, PETER! I'M JUST SICK OF IT! THREE PEOPLE HAVE DIED WITH SYMPTOMS OF LEGIONNAIRES'. DONALD WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE DOWN THE WARD. I'M NOT A DOCTOR, BUT DON'T YOU THINK CLOSING IT DOWN IS A LITTLE EXTREME? NO, I DON'T, NOT IF IT'S LEGIONNAIRES'. I ASK HIM WHAT THE WORD "IMPALE" MEANS. HE STUCK THIS LETTER OPENER ON HIS HAND AND SAID, "STICK THAT SUCKER THROUGH." I GAVE IT A GOOD LISTEN, AND IT'S GOING, "LUB-DUB, LUB-DUB." NO, NO, EHRLICH. IF THERE'S A MURMUR, IT WOULD BE, "LUB-SCHTUB, LUB-SCHTUB." OH, I SEE. "LUB-SCHTUB." TRY TO REMEMBER THAT, WILL YOU? IT COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOUR PATIENT BEING ALIVE OR DEAD.

 IF HE'S A C.O.P.D.-ER, YOU'RE GONNA NEED A BASELINE PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST. IS HE STILL GIVING YOU THAT STORY ABOUT COUGHING UP BLOOD? MM-HMM. HAVE PULMONARY SCOPE HIM AND CHECK FOR LESIONS, THEN GET A BIOPSY WITH BRUSHINGS. NEVER A DULL MOMENT. WHERE'S MY... HMM? I FOUND THIS ON THE BODY OF A 78-YEAR-OLD PATIENT. "WHERE ARE THE DOPE FIELDS? THE HELICOPTERS ARE GREEN." HE CAME DOWN FROM C.C.U. HE WAS THERE FOR FOUR STRAIGHT WEEKS. I.C.U. PSYCHOSIS. WHERE ARE THE DOPE FIELDS? THERE ARE SOME CALCIFIED GRANULOMAS ON HIS CHEST X-RAY. THAT MEANS THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IS C.A. CALL FELDMAN AND HAVE HIM BRONCHED. EXCUSE ME. HEY, HEY. I'M GOING DOWN TO CHESTNUT HILL RESERVOIR LATER, DO SOME NIGHT FISHING. YOU WANNA COME? WHAT ARE YOU, HIGH ON VITAMIN "C"? FISHING'S ILLEGAL AT CHESTNUT HILL. I KNOW THAT, BUT EVERYBODY DOES IT. ILLEGAL, AS IN PUT YOU IN THE SAME CELL AS SON OF SAM, THE BOSTON STRANGLER, JOHN WILKES BOOTH. COME ON. FISHING'S FUN. EHRLICH, SITTING ON CONCRETE, HOLDING A STICK WITH A STRING DANGLING IN THE WATER... AND DUCKING INTO THE WOODS EVERY TIME A COP CAR PASSES IS NOT FUN. A CARDIAC ARREST IN THE MIDDLE OF REM SLEEP... THAT'S FUN. A WINO WITH AN E.E.G. OF TWO SPIKES... THAT'S FUN. A LITTLE DALLIANCE IN THE ON CALL ROOM... OH, WAIT A SECOND. I SEE. YOU HAVE OTHER PLANS. UH-HUH. MM-HMM. CATHY MARTIN, I PRESUME. OH, LUCKY FOR HER, I'M NOT PUMPIN' IRON. YEAH, WELL, MY SISTER HAD A MIDWIFE. SHIRLEY, THIS DOCTOR'S WIFE IS NOT GONNA GIVE BIRTH AT HOME. THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER. YEAH, BUT STILL, I WANT NINA TO HAVE THE BABY IN A HOSPITAL. I WANT HER TO HAVE THE BEST CARE POSSIBLE. JACK, IF YOU'RE SO WORRIED, WHY DON'T YOU DELIVER THE BABY YOURSELF? MRS. WEINGROT COULD HAVE WAITED UNTIL ROUNDS. WHO? 338. THE WOMAN YOU WOKE ME FOR. SHE COMPLAINED OF STOMACH PAINS. MISSING A BOWEL MOVEMENT IS NOT AN EMERGENCY. DID YOU LOOK UNDER IT? WELL, COME ON! LOOK UNDER IT! IT ISN'T? DAMN IT! I WOULDN'T DO THAT IF I WERE YOU. YES, I LOOKED IN THE CAFETERIA. I LOOKED IN EVERY INCH OF THIS PLACE. ALL RIGHT. IT'S $260. I'LL GET THE MONEY. I'LL GET THE MONEY. PETER. LOOK, I GOTTA GO NOW. TELL YOU WHAT... IF YOU FIND IT, YOU CALL ME, OKAY? OKAY? BYE-BYE. HELL OF A TUMOR BOARD THIS MORNING. YEAH, I HEARD. WHERE WERE YOU? MEGAN FELL OFF A SWING IN THE PLAYGROUND. OH, NO. ANYTHING SERIOUS? YEAH, IT'S ALWAYS SERIOUS. IT WAS FUNNY AS HELL THIS MORNING. JACKSON GETS UP AND STARTS CARRYING ON. HE GOES... "DEATH CERTIFICATES PROVE THAT THYROID CANCER... "HASN'T INCREASED IN THE LAST 10 YEARS. WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT?" CRAIG GETS BENT OUT OF SHAPE AND SCREAMS, "BECAUSE DEATH CERTIFICATES ARE WRITTEN BEFORE THEY DO AN AUTOPSY!" I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA MIX IT UP RIGHT THERE. SAMUELS IS GONNA DO A RADICAL NECK. PURE PHYSICAL MUTILATION. YOU WANT TO WATCH? NO, THANKS. OKAY. I'LL CATCH YOU LATER. DR. MENLOW, CALL 10-14. I WAS JUST, UH, TRYING TO GET A LITTLE SLEEP. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY BEEPER AROUND HERE, HAVE YOU? OH, NO. NO BEEPER. BEEPER. IF, UH... IF I DO, I WILL LET YOU KNOW. UH, THANKS. DONALD! DO YOU HAVE A SECOND TO LOOK IN ON A PATIENT? WHO'S THE ATTENDING? GANNON, BUT HE'S IN SURGERY ALL DAY. I'M VERY WORRIED ABOUT HER. WHY? HER NAME'S FRANCINE DELGADO. SHE, SEVEN DAYS AGO, HAD A MITRAL VALVE REPLACEMENT. WHAT'S HER POST-OP COURSE BEEN LIKE? IT WAS EXCELLENT UNTIL ABOUT 24 HOURS AGO. SHE STARTED VOMITING, HAVING DIARRHEA. HER TEMPERATURE WENT THROUGH THE ROOF. IN THE LAST FEW HOURS, SHE'S BEEN COUGHING WITHOUT SPUTUM PRODUCTION. HMM. HAS SHE BEEN COMPLAINING ABOUT ANY WEAKNESS? YES, SHE HAS, AND I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THIS IS THE FIRST TEMP SPIKE AND G.I. DISTRESS SHE'S HAD SINCE SHE CAME OUT OF SURGERY. WILL YOU SEE HER? SURE. WHERE IS SHE? FOLLOW ME. I'M GOING DOWN TO X-RAYS RIGHT NOW TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT FOR YOU, OKAY? GOOD. PETER? I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW. I LOST MY BEEPER. MM-HMM. EXCUSE ME. DID YOU SEE THE HEAD OF HAIR ON HIM? IT'S DISGUSTING. NOW, MARK, HE'S ONLY A KID. I KNOW. I KNOW. SO, YOU'RE OFF TO CABO SAN LUCAS? TOMORROW MORNING. THAT'S TERRIFIC. YOU DESERVE A REST. THIS PLACE IS NOT GONNA RUN VERY SMOOTHLY WITHOUT YOU THOUGH. NONSENSE. BETWEEN DON WESTPHALL AND B.J. CUMMINGS, I HAVE NO WORRIES. YOU KNOW, THAT CUMMINGS KID MAY BE A GOOD HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR, BUT SOMETIMES HE CAN BE A REAL HARDNOSE. I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE LIKE THAT. YOU'VE CAUGHT AN INFECTION, FRANCINE, BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOUR OPERATION. I FEEL LIKE I'M ON FIRE. I CAN'T STOP SHAKING. I ALREADY ORDERED A CHEST X-RAY AND SENT A URINE FOR CULTURE. SPEED UP HER I.V. TO A HUNDRED PER HOUR. NOTHING BY MOUTH. GET A SPUTUM, SEND IT DOWN FOR ROUTINE CULTURE AND SENSITIVITY AND A DIETERLE STAIN. BLOOD CULTURE TIMES THREE, 15 MINUTES APART. THEN GET HER STARTED ON CEPHALOTHIN, ONE GRAM SIX HOURS, AND ERYTHROMYCIN, ONE GRAM EVERY SIX HOURS. I.V. PIGGYBACK, STAT. OKAY. I FEEL SO BAD, DR. WESTPHALL. I KNOW, SWEETHEART. I KNOW. SHOULD WE ISOLATE HER? YEAH. I'M SPITTIN' UP PHLEGM. HAVE YOU CUT DOWN ON YOUR CIGARETTES? YEAH, A LITTLE. I GOTTA TELL YOU, MR. ANDOVER... TWO PACKS OF CIGARETTES A DAY, 40 YEARS... YOUR LUNGS LOOK LIKE THE HILLS OF WEST VIRGINIA. I DON'T MIND SPITTIN' UP SO MUCH, BUT IT'S GREEN. HE COULD BE COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA. GET RESPIRATORY THERAPY DOWN HERE FOR A PULMONARY TOILET, INCLUDING AN I.P.P.B. WITH BRONKOSOL. SAVE ME SOME OF THE SPUTUM FOR A GRAM'S STAIN. MR. ANDOVER, I'M GONNA PUT YOU ON SOME MEDICATION. I DON'T WANT YOU COMING DOWN WITH PNEUMONIA ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE. PUT HIM ON METHICILLIN, ONE GRAM Q6 HOURS, I.V. MR. ANDOVER, CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE? BOY, I'M DYIN' FOR A SMOKE. EH! FIFTEEN BOXES OF HEMOSTATS HAVE DISAPPEARED IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS. I MEAN, IT'S GETTING WORSE, NOT BETTER. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY'RE NOT BEING USED FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES? I SEEN THEM AT THE HEAD SHOPS IN HARVARD SQUARE. THEY USE THEM AS ROACH CLIPS. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. I'M A BOURBON-STRAIGHT-UP MAN MYSELF. YOU MEAN THEY USE THEM TO SMOKE POT? YEAH, SO THEY DON'T BURN THEIR FINGERS. NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION. IF IT DOESN'T STOP, WHEN THEY REACH FOR ONE IN AN OPERATION, THEY MIGHT HAVE TO USE PLIERS. GOT YA. I NEED THE CHARTS ON TWO DECEASED PATIENTS FROM LAST... LAST WEEK. I DON'T HAVE THEIR NUMBERS. SORRY. THEIR NAMES ARE BRENDA PEREZ... AND LILA ROTHLEIN... R-O-T-H-L-E-I-N. THEY WERE DR. CHANDLER'S PATIENTS. THANK YOU. SOLITARY PULMONARY LESION. MMM. PROBABLY CANCER. MMM. YEAH, IT'S A CLASSIC LESION OF BRONCHOGENIC CANCER... UNEVEN MARGINS WITH CALCIFICATIONS LIKE A CRAB. SEE HERE? TRABECULAE INVADING THE TISSUE. DO WE HAVE AUTOPSIES ON THOSE TWO PATIENTS THAT DIED OF PNEUMONIA? PEREZ AND ROTHLEIN? NO, WE DIDN'T SEE ANY REASON TO. CAUSE OF DEATH WAS RESPIRATORY ARREST... EMPHYSEMA WITH COMPLICATIONS. OH. WHAT'S UP, DR. WESTPHALL? I HAVE A SIMILAR CASE... FRANCINE DELGADO. WELL, THERE'S LOTS OF INFECTIONS IN THESE OLD WARDS. NO, THIS ISN'T TYPICAL PNEUMONIA. COMPROMISED HOST, PRODROMAL DIARRHEA, HIGH TEMPERATURE, SLOW PULSE, PRODUCTIVE COUGH. - SOUNDS LIKE LEGIONNAIRES'. - MMM. DID PEREZ OR ROTHLEIN HAVE ANY FEATURES THAT MIGHT BE CONSISTENT WITH LEGIONNAIRES'? I DON'T REMEMBER. THEY WENT PRETTY FAST. HOW ARE YOU TREATING MISS DELGADO? I GAVE HER ERYTHROMYCIN AND CEPHALOTHIN. I HAD A PATIENT WITH DIARRHEA. OH, WAIT. - WHAT? - SHE CAME IN WITH IT. UH, FOOD POISONING. OH. WELL, ALL THIS IS PREMATURE, SO LET'S KEEP IT QUIET. SURE, DR. WESTPHALL. PEOPLE GET CRAZY. HI, CATHY. HOW'S IT GOING? POLICE JUST BROUGHT THIS ONE IN. FOUND HIM LYING IN THE MEAT PACKING DISTRICT. ALL HIS TEETH WERE PULLED OUT, AND WHOEVER DID IT REALLY SMASHED IN HIS CHEST. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU? I HAVE A SPUTUM COMING DOWN FOR ACID FAST, FUNGAL STUDIES AND A DIETERLE SILVER STAIN. CAN YOU LOOK AT IT RIGHT AWAY? DIETERLE? HAVE WE GOT LEGIONNAIRES'? LET'S HOPE NOT. THE STAIN WILL TAKE A WHILE. ALL RIGHT. I ALSO HAVE A SERUM TITERS FOR LEGIONELLA COOKING. LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK, HUH? YEAH. DONALD HAS COME TO ME QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT THE RECENT DEATHS ON WARD 5. - AND YOU THINK IT'S LEGIONNAIRES'. - POSSIBLY. UH-HUH. UH-HUH. HAVE YOU CHECKED WITH THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL IN ATLANTA? NO, NOT YET. WE HAVE A DIETERLE DOWN IN PATHOLOGY NOW. SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE RESULTS COME IN. I DON'T THINK THAT'S VERY WISE. DONALD WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE DOWN THE WARD. WARD 5 HAS 35 BEDS. NOW, I'M NOT A DOCTOR, BUT DON'T YOU THINK CLOSING IT DOWN IS A LITTLE EXTREME, PREMATURE? NO, I DON'T, NOT IF IT'S LEGIONNAIRES'. YOU SEE, THERE'S A SEPARATE AIR CONDITIONER IN THERE. ARE YOU AWARE THAT WE'RE DUE FOR OUR QUARTERLY CENSUS? OUR STATE SUBSIDY IS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF BEDS USED. IF WE CLOSE DOWN WARD 5, EVEN FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS, WE'LL LOSE SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS. THREE PEOPLE HAVE DIED WITH SYMPTOMS OF LEGIONNAIRES'. THAT'S QUITE A COINCIDENCE. WERE THE PATIENTS IN GOOD HEALTH? NO. TWO OF THEM WERE ELDERLY WOMEN WITH HISTORIES OF CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASE. THE THIRD HAD JUST COME OUT OF OPEN-HEART SURGERY, BUT SHE WAS ON WARD 5 BEFORE THE OPERATION. THERE ARE A LOT OF INFECTIONS RUNNING LOOSE AROUND A HOSPITAL. THERE WERE THREE MILLION CASES OF PNEUMONIA IN THE UNITED STATES LAST YEAR. ONE THIRD OF THEM WERE OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN. THIS IS OUR MOST RECENT REPORT ON NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS. WERE ANY OF THESE PEOPLE ON A RESPIRATOR? TWO. WELL, WE HAVE HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED PSEUDOMONAS INFECTIONS FROM A RESPIRATOR, TWO METHICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPH INFECTIONS... AND RECENTLY A RUN OF GRAM-NEGATIVE ENTERIC BACILLI E. COLI KLEBSIELLA. THEY'RE NOT SENSITIVE TO ANY OF THE STANDARD ANTIBACTERIAL DRUGS. THEY'RE NOT EVEN SENSITIVE TO THE THIRD-GENERATION CEPHALOSPORINS. IN EACH CASE... I KNOW. WE ISOLATE THE PATIENT, PUT THEM ON TRIPLE ANTIBIOTICS AND HOPE THAT ONE HITS, BUT WE DO NOT CLOSE DOWN A WARD. NO, WE DON'T. I THINK WE SHOULD WAIT FOR THE DIETERLE AND THE LEGIONELLA TITERS. WE KNOW HE CHECKED OUT, FISCUS. WAS HE "0" OR WAS HE "Q"? "Q." DEFINITE "Q." HEY, CATHY. SIT OVER HERE. WHAT, WITH EVERYBODY? WHAT EVERYBODY? EHRLICH? COME ON. ALL RIGHT. I'LL GET THAT. HERE. LET'S GET YOU A CHAIR. SIT DOWN. ENJOY. OKAY, WHERE WAS I? OH, YEAH. SO I GO OVER TO THE WIFE AND TELL HER SHE'S A WIDOW. SHE GETS ALL UPSET AND SAYS, "I KNEW HE'D PULL SOMETHING LIKE THAT." AND THEN SHE PROCEEDS TO ASK MY ADVICE IN HOW TO SPEND THE INSURANCE MONEY. INTERESTING YOU SHOULD SAY THAT. THE HISTORY OF THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS QUITE FASCINATING ACTUALLY. AS WILLIAM STEWART HALSTEAD, THE NOTED ENDOCRINOLOGIST... AND A CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND OF MY FATHER, ONCE SAID... IT'S NOT A PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEM, V.J. NO? MM-MMM. IT'S ONE OF DICTION. YOU DON'T NEED A THERAPIST, YOU NEED A TUTOR. YES? HMM. SURE. LOOK, V.J. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE WITTY OR CHARMING OR WARM... IF YOU DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. NO MATTER HOW SMART YOU ARE, IT'S INTERPRETED AS BEING STUPID. UH-HUH. HE'S GOING ON AND ON ABOUT HOW A CERTAIN PATIENT DIED OF C.H.F. FROM MITRAL STENOSIS. TALKS FOR ABOUT TWO HOURS. WHEN IT'S TIME FOR PATHOLOGY TO GIVE ITS FINDINGS, A THIRD-YEAR PATH RESIDENT STANDS UP, LOOKS FRAZIER RIGHT IN THE FACE... AND SAYS, "THE MITRAL VALVE WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL." FRAZIER GETS TOTALLY BENT OUT OF SHAPE. "I KNOW IT WAS MITRAL STENOSIS! I HEARD THE MURMUR. I SHOULD KNOW!" THE RESIDENT HOLDS UP HIS HAND. HE'S GOT THE VALVE IN A JAR AND SAYS TO FRAZIER, "I HAVE THE VALVE. HAVE YOU GOT THE MURMUR?" - IT WAS PERFECT. - THAT'S GREAT. DR. WHITE? YOUR PATIENT, MR. ANDOVER? YOU PRESCRIBED METHICILLIN. YES. ARE YOU AWARE THAT THE MAN IS ALLERGIC TO PENICILLIN? THE LAST THING HE NEEDS IS TO GO INTO AN ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION. I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THAT. I'VE BEEN REALLY PREOCCUPIED LATELY. TRY TO CONCENTRATE ON YOUR PATIENTS, DOCTOR. THIS IS GOING DOWN ON YOUR EVALUATION. CALLING EVERY TIME A PATIENT HAS CONSTIPATION OR AN I.V. POPS OUT ISN'T NORMAL PROCEDURE. I MEAN, LOCEFF HAS NEVER BEEN OVERLY FRIENDLY OR OPEN. I ALWAYS CHALKED IT UP TO A DIFFERENCE IN PERSONALITIES, BUT THIS IS JUST GETTING WORSE. WHY IS LOCEFF GIVING YOU SUCH A HARD TIME? I DON'T KNOW. OBVIOUSLY SHE RESENTS YOU. I MEAN, LOOK, FACE IT... SISTERHOOD, TOGETHERNESS... THAT'S FINE UP TO A POINT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU'RE A DOCTOR, SHE'S A NURSE. MY FIRST DAY IN THE O.R., WHEN I WAS A MEDICAL STUDENT, THIS OLD NURSE SAYS TO ME, "DON'T YOU WEAR A NYLON SLIP UNDER YOUR SCRUB GOWN, YOUNG LADY. "IT MIGHT SET UP ELECTRICAL CHARGES... AND CAUSE AN EXPLOSION OF THE ANESTHETIC GASES AND DAMAGE THE O.R." THEY DON'T EVEN USE EXPLOSIVE GASES ANYMORE. YOU WANT MY ADVICE? FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE. MAKE HER MONITOR VITAL SIGNS EVERY 15 MINUTES. LET HER DO A HUNDRED URINES AT NIGHT, HUH? SHE'LL GET THE MESSAGE. THAT'S NOT MY STYLE. WAKING UP AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING TO PUT IN AN I.V... THAT'S YOUR STYLE? BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION CAN BE A WONDERFUL THING. WHY ARE THEY PUTTING ME INTO THIS CONTRAPTION, DR. MORRISON? WE HAVE TO WEIGH YOU SO WE CAN MONITOR YOU... FOR MALNUTRITION, DEHYDRATION, THINGS LIKE THAT. GEEZ! I SURVIVED THE DEPRESSION, EIGHT YEARS OF BOXING... THANKS, GUYS. BEING PANCAKED ON A CARRIER IN THE PACIFIC. HELL, I MADE IT THROUGH THREE MARRIAGES. BUT THIS DAMN HERNIA IS PUTTING ME AWAY LIKE NOBODY'S BUSINESS. IT WAS AN INCARCERATED HERNIA, LEO. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH, BUT IT IS. WE'RE GONNA LET YOU REST UP HERE A WHILE, LEO. IT'LL PREVENT BEDSORES. WOULD YOU BELIEVE A ROTTING DINOSAUR LIKE ME... USED TO BE A HANDSOME YOUNG BUCK LIKE DR. MORRISON HERE? 180 POUNDS. - HEAVYWEIGHT, LEO? - NO, I WAS A LIGHT-HEAVYWEIGHT. I MADE NUMBER SIX. OH, YEAH? YEAH. THEN UNCLE SAM, HE GRABBED ME. DAMN WAR PROBABLY KEPT ME FROM GETTING KILLED. I MEAN, I COULDN'T JAB TO SAVE MY LIFE. - MEAN UPPERCUT, NO DOUBT. - YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. HEY, COME HERE. WHEN CAN I YOU-KNOW-WHAT AGAIN? WE'LL TRY AND TAKE THE CATHETER OUT IN A DAY OR SO. IT'S KILLING ME, DOC. I MEAN, IT'S HUMILIATING. OH, I WAS JUST ASKING THE DOC IF A BEAUTIFUL DOLL LIKE YOU IS MARRIED. THAT'S ALL. DR. CAVANERO, ROOM 254. DR. CAVANERO, ROOM 254. ANNIE. HMM? THEY WANT YOU IN ROOM 254. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GIVE TOM SELLECK A COMPLETE PHYSICAL. SORRY. TOO BAD, TOM. YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT. HI, CATHY. HI. BYE. ARE YOU OFF FOR THE REST OF THE DAY? UH-HUH. NICE DRESS. YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU WEAR WHITE. I'M GOING TO A FUNERAL. CATHY, USUALLY PEOPLE WEAR BLACK TO FUNERALS. I'VE NOTICED THAT. BUT YOU SEE, IN ASIA, WHITE IS WORN FOR MOURNING. THEY CONSIDER WHITE... THE ABSENCE OF COLOR... THE ABSENCE OF LIFE. WHEREAS BLACK... THE COMBINATION OF ALL COLORS... IS A SYMBOL OF LIFE. I SEE. WHO DIED? I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME. YOU DON'T KNOW THE PERSON WHO'S BEING BURIED? THEY BROUGHT HIM INTO THE MORGUE YESTERDAY. THEY'RE GOING TO DUMP HIM IN THE CITY CEMETERY... NO MARKER OR ANYTHING. OH, THAT IS REALLY... WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER TO OUR HOUSE FOR DINNER SOMETIME THIS WEEK? I'D LOVE FOR MY HUSBAND TO MEET YOU. THAT'D BE NICE, JACQUELINE. THANKS. AND BRING FISCUS. ROBERT LOVES FISCUS. EVERYBODY DOES. HE'S SO FUNNY. YOU KNOW, I WISH ROBERT HAD FISCUS'S SENSE OF HUMOR. ROBERT JUST DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO HAVE A GOOD TIME. YOUR HUSBAND'S BORING? NO. WELL, SOMETIMES A LITTLE. HE'S A WORKAHOLIC. HE'S VERY LOW-KEYED, VERY ANALYTICAL. AND IT DRIVES ME CRAZY WHEN HE TRIMS HIS OWN BEARD... BECAUSE HE LEAVES LITTLE HAIR CLIPPINGS ALL OVER THE SINK. UGH. HOW HORRIBLE. I GUESS I'M BEING A LITTLE HARD ON HIM, BUT MY HUSBAND IS NOT WHAT YOU'D CALL A ROMANTIC. WHY DO YOU STAY WITH HIM? BECAUSE I LOVE HIM. HMM. WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY? THURSDAY? MY HUSBAND IS A TERRIBLE CHEF. HIS LOBSTER ARCHDUKE WILL KILL YOU. OH? BUT WE'VE GOT A GREAT WINE CELLAR. OKAY. GOOD. WILL YOU ASK FISCUS OR SHOULD I? UM, I'M SEEING HIM TONIGHT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW. I'D BETTER GET GOING. I DON'T WANT TO BE LATE FOR THE FUNERAL. RIGHT. - GOOD-BYE. - BYE. I TOLD HER THAT... SHH. I TRIED TO TELL THAT NURSE THIS WAS NO KIND OF BIG DEAL. IT'S JUST A LITTLE UPSET STOMACH. THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. IT HAPPENS WHEN YOU GO BACK ON SOLIDS. I WANT YOU TO EAT REAL LIGHT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS... JUICES, SOUPS, JELL-O's... THAT KIND OF THING. HOW 'BOUT FRUIT? MM-MMM. YEAH, BUT MRS. SHALLO ORDERED A BUCKET. I DON'T CARE WHAT MRS. SHALLO TOLD YOU ON THE TELEPHONE. SHE CANNOT HAVE A BUCKET OF CHICKEN TWO HOURS BEFORE HER OPERATION! LOCEFF? WHY DID YOU CALL ME FOR MR. PRENSKY? HE WAS HAVING STOMACH CRAMPS. IT WAS SIMPLE INDIGESTION. I'M GONNA SAY THIS ONE MORE TIME. INDIGESTION, INSOMNIA, CONSTIPATION... NONE OF THESE ARE EMERGENCIES. THEY CAN WAIT UNTIL ROUNDS. I'M NOT PAID TO MAKE THOSE JUDGMENTS, DR. CAVANERO. I HAVE BEEN UP FOR 36 HOURS. I WAS TRYING TO CATCH A LITTLE SLEEP. I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. NURSE LOCEFF, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO GIVE A TAP WATER ENEMA... TO PATIENTS WEINGROT, MALIAN AND O'CONNELL WHEN THEY WAKE UP. ALSO I WOULD LIKE DAILY WEIGHTS AND I&O;'s ON ALL MY PATIENTS. IS THAT CLEAR? YES, DR. CAVANERO. GOOD. FOUR, FIVE. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE. - OKAY. HOW LONG? - THIRTY-FIVE MINUTES. - ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE. - COME ON, FRANCINE. COME ON. COME ON. OKAY. STOP C.P.R. LET'S GET A READING HERE. ASYSTOLE. CAN SOMEBODY RELIEVE ME? I'M DEAD. OKAY. WE'LL GO UNTIL THE NEXT BLOOD GAS COMES IN. NURSE, GIVE ME ONE AMP I.V. EPI, ONE TO 1,000. ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE. COME ON, SWEETHEART. LIVE. ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE. - ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE. - GIVE ME THE NUMBERS. 65, 15, P.H. 7.05. THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE. ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE. - GIVE IT UP. - ONE AND TWO AND THREE AND FOUR... AND FIVE. I'LL INFORM THE FAMILY. MY HANDS ARE NUMB. ONE, TWO, THREE. CAUSE OF DEATH WAS ACUTE RESPIRATORY ARREST. EITHER THE MEDS DIDN'T KICK IN FAST ENOUGH... OR SHE WAS TOO WEAK AFTER THE OPEN HEART SURGERY TO FIGHT THE INFECTION. I WANT AN AUTOPSY. IT'S AFTER 4:30, DR. WESTPHALL. PATHOLOGY'S CLOSED. OPEN IT. YEAH, 'CAUSE PEOPLE ARE DYING TO GET IN. SOMETHING FUNNY? - NO, SIR. - WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - JOE ROECKLEIN. - MR.

I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. PLEASE. YOU CAN'T JUST... WAIT A SECOND. YOU CAN'T JUST WALK OUT THE DOOR. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON. ALL YOU WANTED OUT OF THIS WAS A GOOD TIME, REMEMBER? THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID YOU WANTED, AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT. BUT NOW, WAYNE, IT'S... SAY IT! I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP. ALL RIGHT. YOU DON'T WANT A RELATIONSHIP? WE WON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP. YOU WANT TO CALL IT SOMETHING ELSE? IT'S JUST A WORD. IT'LL BE A BROUHAHA, A BAGATELLE, A BRIC-A-BRAC. WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME? YOU NEVER LISTEN TO WHAT I'M SAYING. I DO TOO. I DON'T WANT A RELATIONSHIP. YOU MEAN YOU DON'T WANT A RELATIONSHIP, OR YOU DON'T WANT A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME? WITH YOU. I LIKE YOU, WAYNE. I DON'T LOVE YOU. YOU'VE BEEN SO NICE TO ME. I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU. MM-HMM. BUT EVERY TIME I TRY TO GET SERIOUS, YOU ALWAYS TURN IT INTO A JOKE. I'M SORRY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I THOUGHT YOU TOOK THE NIGHT OFF. WHAT CAN I SAY? I CAN'T, UH, STAY AWAY FROM THE PLACE. YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S PARADISE. TO ME IT IS. SEE, THE TROUBLE WITH THE REAL WORLD IS IT JUST ISN'T REAL ENOUGH. IT LACKS INTENSITY, EXCITEMENT, THE ELEMENT OF THE UNPREDICTABLE. GIVE ME A G.I. BLEEDER, A FULL ARREST OR A COMA OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY, AND I'M IN HEAVEN. NOT ONLY THAT, I LOVE THE FREE FOOD. ARE YOU OKAY? YOU LOOK TERRIBLE. SURE, I LOOK TERRIBLE, BUT I FEEL TERRIFIC. MY PULSE IS RACING. MY EYES ARE DILATING. MY WHITE CORPUSCLES ARE FIGHTING OFF INFECTION AT EVERY TURN. BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU, CAVANERO? I MEAN, I HATE TO BE THE ONE TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SAG. TIME AND THE PRESSURES OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION ARE BEGINNING TO TAKE THEIR TOLL. YOU SHOULD GET SOME OUTSIDE INTERESTS, LIKE YODELLING OR BAREBACK RIDING. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT? IF YOU WANT, I'D BE HAPPY TO LET YOU RIDE BARE ON MY BACK. THEY PUT YOU ON HOLD AND THEY FORGET ABOUT YOU. ALL RIGHT. LOOK, WENDY. I'M STUCK. WHAT, PETER? I NEED TO GO PICK UP MY CAR. CAN YOU COVER FOR ME? FOR HOW LONG? HOUR, HOUR AND A HALF TOPS. PROBABLY NOT EVEN THAT. YEAH, SURE. HEY, THANKS. I OWE YOU ONE. REALLY. I OWE YOU ONE. STILL PAINTING, HUGH? STILL LIFES. APPLES AND PEARS AND STUFF LIKE THAT, HUH? I'M NOT VERY GOOD WITH THINGS THAT MOVE. DO YOU TRY TO MAKE THEM LOOK REAL, OR ARE YOU A FAN OF THAT ABSTRACT MALARKEY? I GOT AN ARTIST TO PAINT A PICTURE OF MY WIFE, MY SON AND MYSELF. YOU SHOULD HAVE... BOY, I HAD REAL PROBLEMS WITH IT. I MEAN, HE CAUGHT MY WIFE ALL RIGHT, BUT WHAT HE DID TO MY SON... YOU'D HAVE THOUGHT HE HAD A CLEFT PALATE. IT'S JUST A LITTLE DIMPLE IS ALL. NEVER HURT KIRK DOUGLAS. DR. ROSS TO I.C.U. DR. ROSS TO I.C.U. DAMN SMOKE GETS INTO EVERYTHING. A MAN WANTS TO KILL HIMSELF, YOU'D THINK HE'D HAVE THE DECENCY... TO NOT STINK UP EVERYTHING. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, WE'RE IN A HOSPITAL! I MEAN, WE'VE GOT ENOUGH GERMS CRAWLING AROUND AS IT IS. SURE, THEY WASH THE FLOORS, BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T GET INTO THE CORNERS. AND DID YOU EVER CHECK UNDER THE BEDS? TUMBLIN' TUMBLEWEED UNDER THERE. HAIR ON THE SINKS. WINDOW SMUDGES. CRUD IN THE SOAP DISHES. CHECK AND MATE. HI, IRA. HI. LISTEN, HONEY. I'M NOT GONNA BE HOME FOR A WHILE. HELEN, DO YOU HAVE AN ASPIRIN? IT'S IN THE BACK. THANKS. WHAT? YEAH. WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE. THANK YOU. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING? I JUST FEEL... SO LOUSY. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY. I'M 37 YEARS OLD. I COME TO WORK, I GO HOME TO AN EMPTY APARTMENT... AND I GO TO SLEEP. TWELVE YEARS. AND I HATE IT. I USED TO FANTASIZE... I'D MEET SOMEONE... AND MY LIFE WOULD BE DIFFERENT. NOW I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE LIVING WITH SOMEONE AGAIN. YOU SEEM TO HAVE EVERYTHING GOING FOR YOU. THAT MAKES ME HURT EVEN MORE. I HAVEN'T HAD A RELATIONSHIP... A REAL ONE... WITH A MAN... IN... LONGER THAN I CARE TO REMEMBER. WHEN I GO OUT WITH A GUY, EITHER HE CAN'T HANDLE MY BEING A DOCTOR... OR I'M AFRAID I'LL BE SWALLOWED UP AND THEN LOSE MY INDEPENDENCE. SO, CONSEQUENTLY, I CAN'T SEEM TO GET THIS WORK-LOVE THING TO WORK TOGETHER AT THE SAME TIME. AND ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER JUST ISN'T ENOUGH. SOMETIMES I FEEL AS THOUGH I'VE BEEN SOLD A BILL OF GOODS. YEAH. IS IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING HAS GOTTEN SO DIFFICULT, OR IS IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS JUST TOO EASY? SO, YOU SEE, YOU'RE NOT ALONE. WHERE THE HELL IS THAT ASPIRIN? SECURITY, REPORT TO E.R. IMMEDIATELY. SECURITY, REPORT TO E.R. YOU'VE GOTTA BE CRAZY TO EAT IN THIS PLACE VOLUNTARILY. HEY, PETER WHITE. SIT DOWN. YEAH. BELIEVE ME, THE FOOD HERE IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING WE GET AT THE COURTHOUSE CAFETERIA. THEY SEASON EVERYTHING WITH JURISPRUDENCE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? OH, I'M VISITING A CLIENT. HER GARDENER HAD THE BAD TASTE TO HIT HER WITH A SHOVEL. HAVEN'T SEEN YOU FOR A WHILE. MAN, THIS PLACE KEEPS ME PRETTY BUSY. I'VE BEEN MEANING TO GIVE YOU A CALL. OH, YEAH? ABOUT WHAT? LAST TIME I SAW YOU AT DANNY'S BARBECUE, YOU'D JUST QUIT LEVINE-LAMBERT. YEAH, I WANTED OUT OF THE CORPORATE GAME SOMETHING AWFUL. YOU WERE SAYING HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO FIND CLIENTS FOR A NEW LAW FIRM. IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT ON YOUR OWN, YOU GOTTA BE WILLING TO PAY THE PIPER. I DON'T EXACTLY GET THE CRÈME DE LA CRÈME YET. I RUN INTO A LOT OF POTENTIAL LEGAL CASES HERE AT THE HOSPITAL... HIT AND RUN, INSURANCE CLAIMS, NEGLIGENCE. THAT SORT OF THING, YOU KNOW? UH-HUH. YEAH? I-I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD WORK OUT AN ARRANGEMENT... WHERE YOU GET FIRST CRACK AT SOME OF THESE CASES. UH, YEAH, SURE. GREAT. I'D LIKE THAT. AS A MATTER OF FACT, I GOT A COUPLE OF OTHER BUDDIES OVER AT BOSTON GENERAL... ALSO RESIDENTS... AND WE'VE WORKED OUT A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT. EVERYBODY DOES IT THESE DAYS. THEY GET A HUNDRED BUCKS FOR EVERY REFERRAL THAT TURNS INTO A CLIENT. BUT, UH, JUST SO WE BOTH KNOW WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE, PETER, UNDER YOUR CITY CONTRACT, IT'S NOT EXACTLY LEGAL... FOR YOU TO SOLICIT BUSINESS FOR SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF. PUTTING YOUR CARD IN SOMEBODY'S POCKET'S NOT GONNA HURT ANYBODY. HEY, LOOK, PETER, WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER ALL THAT WELL, BUT LISTEN. WHY DON'T YOU THINK THE WHOLE THING OVER? OKAY. THANK YOU. SURE. HE WAS ADMITTED WITH AN ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION... WHICH REQUIRED ADDITIONAL I.V. ANTIBIOTICS. YOUR BASIC INFECTED BEE STING. AT 6:30 THIS MORNING, HE COMPLAINED OF SLIGHT DIZZINESS AND SOME DIARRHEA. HE HAD A FEVER OF 99.6, AND DR. EHRLICH PRESCRIBED ANCEF, ONE GRAM Q6 HOURS. 1:30, HE HAD A TEMPERATURE THAT HAD RISEN TO 101. HE COMPLAINED OF DIARRHEA, FEVER, CHILLS AND HAD SOME DYSPNEA WITH A PRODUCTIVE COUGH. HOW OLD IS HE? NINETEEN. ANY PREVIOUS RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS? NONE. 102.6. HI, PAL. I HEAR YOU HAD A PRETTY ROUGH DAY. IT REALLY BURNS WHEN I BREATHE DEEPLY. IS HE BRINGING UP PHLEGM? HE'S ALSO GOT A STOOL THAT'S 90% WATER. CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING FOR ME, DOCTOR? START HIM ON ERYTHROMYCIN, ONE GRAM EVERY SIX HOURS. I ALREADY ORDERED IT. NOW, DON'T WORRY, SON. YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. HELEN? DR. BUCKINGHAM TO N.I.C.U. DR. BUCKINGHAM TO N.I.C.U. CLOSE DOWN THE WARD. SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING. YOU'RE IN YOUR SECOND YEAR OF RESIDENCY? FIRST. MARRIED? YES. ANY KIDS? YES. OUR DAUGHTER IS FOUR, AND TIMOTHY IS ALMOST 10 MONTHS. PLANNING ANY MORE? NO. WE'RE ALL DONE. EVERYTHING LOOKS FINE. GIVE THIS TO SALLY OUT FRONT. SHE'LL EXPLAIN OUR ENTIRE PROCEDURE TO YOU AND WRITE YOU OUT A CHECK. THANK YOU. MENTION US TO YOUR COLLEAGUES. WE'RE ALWAYS GLAD WHEN A DOCTOR DECIDES TO DONATE HIS SPERM. THE FOMITES AND THE CULTURE MEDIA WILL ALL HAVE TO BE PICKED UP... AND CHECKED FOR CROSS CONTAMINATION. THESE ARE YOUR FOMITES... ISOLATION GOWN, TUBING, BOTTLES OF SALIVA. HOW ABOUT PAPERS OR BOOKS... THAT SORT OF THING? BASICALLY, ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE INFECTION. NOW, THE CULTURE MEDIUM... FOOD, WATER, CUSTARD... ANYWHERE THE BACTERIA CAN GROW. NOW LISTEN TO ME. EVERYTHING THAT YOU PICK UP WILL BE RUN THROUGH DR. BOROVAY FROM C.D.C., SO IT'LL SAVE ME A LOT OF TIME IF YOU'LL DIVIDE THINGS UP AMONG YOURSELVES, OKAY? ARE YOU SURE WE'RE NOT GONNA CATCH NOTHING? WEAR YOUR MASKS AND KEEP YOUR HANDS WASHED. YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT CATCHING IT FROM ANOTHER PATIENT? IT'S NOT TRANSMITTED FROM PERSON TO PERSON. WE'LL BE GRADING ALL OUR PATIENTS... PUTTING THEM INTO TWO GROUPS. LOW PROBABILITY... YOUNG PATIENTS, FIRST DAY PATIENTS, ASTHMATICS, PRE-OPS. THIS GROUP WILL BE RE-SHUTTLED INTO THE GENERAL HOSPITAL POPULATION. GROUP TWO ARE THE HIGH PROBABILITIES... ANYONE WITH COMPROMISED RESPIRATORY STATUS OR IMMUNE DEFICIENT, AND ANYONE OVER 65. WE TAKE THEM TO WARD 4 EAST. TAKE SPECIAL CARE WITH THE OLD PEOPLE. NOTHING GOES IN, NOTHING COMES OUT. WARD 5 IS TO BE COMPLETELY SEALED.
