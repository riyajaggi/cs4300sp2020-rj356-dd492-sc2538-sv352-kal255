 THIS WEEK ON ST. ELSEWHERE. WILL EVERYONE SHUT UP FOR ONE LOUSY MINUTE? TELL ME THIS CHAOS WILL END. THIS CHAOS WILL END. HAVE YOU FELT THIS WAY ANY OTHER TIME? NO.

 WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE INVOLVED THAN ANY OF US HAD PLANNED. BUT 35 PATIENTS HAVE BEEN SAFELY TRANSFERRED FROM, UH, WARD 5, AND THAT WARD WILL REMAIN CLOSED UNTIL WE RECEIVE CONFIRMATION... FROM DR. BOROVAY FROM THE C.D.C. IN ATLANTA. AND I MUST TELL YOU THAT, UH, WE FULLY EXPECT THAT DR. BOROVAY... WILL CONFIRM OUR PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS OF LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SINCE YOU'RE NOT DOCTORS, IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE IF I TELL YOU A BIT ABOUT THIS DISEASE. LEGIONNAIRES' IS A RESPIRATORY INFECTION, VERY OFTEN RESULTS IN PNEUMONIA. IT'S PRECEDED BY DIARRHEA, HIGH FEVER, SLOW PULSE RATE, PRODUCTIVE COUGH. IT'S USUALLY FOUND IN PATIENTS WHO ARE ALREADY EXTREMELY ILL... OR THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAVE A LOW RESISTANCE TO INFECTION. IT'S THOUGHT TO ARISE FROM CONTAMINATED RESPIRATORY EQUIPMENT... OR VENTILATING SYSTEMS. DONALD, CAN WE OPEN THIS UP TO QUESTIONS? FINE. YOU SAID THAT SEVEN OF THE 35 PATIENTS... WERE CLASSIFIED AS HIGH-RISK PROBABILITIES. YES, THEY'RE IN ISOLATION ON WARD 2 EAST. AND THAT REQUIRED SOME MORE BEDS TO BE SHUFFLED. THIRTY-FIVE PATIENTS FROM 2 EAST WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE FOURTH FLOOR. THAT'S WHERE YOU PLACED THE OTHER 28 PATIENTS FROM WARD 5. AS YOU KNOW, THE FOURTH FLOOR HAS THE LARGEST CAPACITY... THAT'S 44 ADDITIONAL PATIENTS... IN A WARD WHOSE RESOURCES ARE BEING TAXED TO THE FULLEST. IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, MR. CUMMINGS... MY QUESTION, AS HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR, IS HOW CAN YOUR STAFF POSSIBLY HANDLE THE LOAD? I DON'T WANT TO JUST SIT AROUND. ARE WE DOING ROUNDS OR WHAT? DON'T TELL ME NOBODY ORDERED A KOSHER PLATE. WE NEED A G.I. CONSULT... 419, FAST. I PUT HER CHART RIGHT THERE. BIG MISTAKE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE CRAZINESS AROUND HERE THESE DAYS. HER NAME IS "ALAMO." ALAIMO. CAROL ALAIMO. SHE WAS ADMITTED BEFORE THEY BROUGHT EVERYONE IN FROM WARD 5. SORRY, VICTOR. I GOTTA TALK TO A DOCTOR. I FEEL WOOZY. MAYBE IT'S CHICKEN POX. NO, THIS AIN'T THE CHICKEN POX. I HAD THE CHICKEN POX. THIS IS A LOT WORSE THAN THE STUPID CHICKEN POX. IT'S IN GOOD CONDITION, HUH? GOOD CONDITION? MINT CONDITION. I'M REALLY NOT IN THE MARKET FOR A CAR, MARK. NOT A CAR. A CLASSIC. YOU DID LAMAZE, DIDN'T YOU? YEAH, IT'S ALL RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? BY THE TIME YOU GET TO YOUR SECOND KID, YOU'RE GONNA WISH THE STORK REALLY DID DROP IT DOWN OUT OF THE CHIMNEY. IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT TIME TO DECIDE. THEY DON'T START LAMAZE TILL THE SEVENTH MONTH. 2,100 TONGUE DEPRESSORS. 5,400 COTTON SWABS. 3,000 PLASTIC STRIPS. RAMON, THIS IS NOT THE BEST TIME TO TAKE INVENTORY. INVENTORY? I'M TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN RIPPED OFF SINCE WE MOVED DOWN FROM 5. WHAT? YEAH! WE NEED SIX UNITS OF AB-NEG, FOUR UNITS OF TYPE O-POSITIVE. I AM LEAVING, AND THAT'S FINAL. IF YOU DO NOT RELEASE ME, I AM CALLING MY ATTORNEY! MRS. SABIN, LIGHTEN UP. OKAY. I REDUCED THE DOSAGE TO 50 MILLIGRAMS. WE'LL START THE N.G. SUCTION AFTER ROUNDS. WELL, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? A HUG AND A KISS? HEY, I DID NOT ASK TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THIS FLOOR. NO. NEITHER DID SKILLING. SKILLING'S THE ONE HE TRIED TO GET FIRED FOR INCOMPETENCE, RIGHT? RIGHT. YOU KNOW, THOSE TWO ARE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN. REMINDS ME OF MY THIRD MARRIAGE. MRS. SABIN WANTS OUT. WHO'S HER DOCTOR? SOME PLASTIC SURGEON FROM BROOKLINE. SHE'S IN FOR A TUCK 'N' ROLL. GIVE HER THE FORMS. 412? SHIRLEY, I ASKED YOU TO GO DOWN TO 412. I TOOK THAT CALL 10 MINUTES AGO. MARTHA MULVAHEY. SHE NEEDED HER PILLOW PROPPED. AGAIN? THE GIRL'S A PEST, HELEN. AFTER ALL, SHE'S ONLY IN FOR A CONSULT. NO, NO, NO, NO. THEY DID A MULTIPLE X-RAY AND BONE SCAN YESTERDAY. DR. ASHLEY THINKS IT'S AN ACUTE SEPTIC ARTHRITIS. VERY, VERY BAD IN HER HANDS. THIS IS HER FIFTH FLARE-UP THIS YEAR. SO, WHO'S GONNA ANSWER THE CALL? WELL, I GUESS I WILL. OH, LISTEN. CANCEL THAT G.I. CONSULT IN 419. NOW THEY NEED A NEUROLOGIST. RIGHT. OKAY! WHERE IS CAROL ALAIMO? WHAT'S IT WORTH TO YOU? OH, STOP! GOOD MORNING, MARTHA. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, BUT I CAN'T ADJUST THE BED. YOU JUST PUSH THE BUTTON. OH. COULD YOU HELP ME, PLEASE? I CAN'T DO IT VERY WELL WITH MY ARTHRITIS. SURE. YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY PRETTY EASY. IT'S JUST THE SAME WAY YOU CALL THE NURSES. THANKS. OKAY? YEAH. I HEARD YOU HAD A ROUGH NIGHT LAST NIGHT. WERE YOUR JOINTS GIVING YOU A LOT OF PAIN? IT WASN'T SO BAD. YOU CERTAINLY KEPT MY NURSES ON THEIR TOES. I HAD TROUBLE SLEEPING. HOW ARE YOU FEELING NOW? ABOUT THE SAME. APOLOGIZE TO THE NURSES FOR ME. I KNOW IT'S OVERCROWDED, AND I KNOW HOW HARD EVERYBODY'S WORKING. THINGS ARE VERY HECTIC. YEAH. BY THE WAY, I STARTED READING ALICE IN WONDERLAND LAST NIGHT TO MY TWO YOUNGEST. I HAD TO DRAG THEM AWAY FROM THE TELEVISION, BUT ONCE I STARTED, THEY WOULDN'T LET ME STOP. IT'S FUNNY HOW YOU FORGET THAT KIND OF STUFF... HOW WONDERFUL SOME BOOKS ARE. I HOPE YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM THAT A LIBRARIAN RECOMMENDED IT. CERTAINLY NOT. I'M NO FOOL. THANKS. I'LL TRY NOT TO BOTHER YOU. OKAY. TAKE IT EASY. OKAY. I'M STARTING TO GET THE IMPRESSION... YOU RESENT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR ACTIONS. NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE AT ALL. I MAY HAVE OVERLOOKED SOME ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES. I'M SORRY IF I DID. BUT SEVEN PEOPLE ARE RESTING COMFORTABLY IN ISOLATION RIGHT NOW, THREE OF WHOM MIGHT BE DEAD AT THIS TIME IF WE HADN'T ACTED WHEN WE DID. IF I HAD IT TO DO OVER, NOTHING WOULD CHANGE. I OFFERED TO GO BELOW BLUE BOOK... AND THROW IN A FULL 90-DAY WARRANTY. I WAS EVEN WILLING TO REPLACE THE HOOD ORNAMENT. WHAT ABOUT THE PING IN THE CYLINDERS? WHAT PING? AND WHERE DID YOU LEARN YOUR METHODOLOGY, YOUNG LADY? IN A CESSPOOL? WRISTS UP. LEFT TO RIGHT. LATERAL IN. RIGHT TO LEFT. LATERAL OUT. DO YOU WANT TO CONTAMINATE THE PATIENT? AND DON'T STAND THERE LOOKING LIKE A MIDWIFE. LATHER UP. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE CALIBER OF MEDICAL EDUCATION... WOULD DETERIORATE SO RAPIDLY IN MY LIFETIME? WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FRATERNAL BOND? IT'S A SAD, SAD COMMENTARY. THE WHAT? NEVER MIND. IF HE DOESN'T UNLOAD THAT GAS HOG SOON, I'M GONNA GO NUTS. HE SPENT 10 MINUTES THIS MORNING TALKING ABOUT A VALVE REPLACEMENT. THEN I REALIZED HE DIDN'T MEAN A VALVE IN THE HEART. HE'S STILL TRYING TO UNLOAD THAT BLUE CONVERTIBLE? I DIDN'T SPEND FOUR LONG YEARS IN MED SCHOOL TO BECOME A USED-CAR SALESMAN. JANE, WHEN YOU FIRST CAME HERE, YOU WERE IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE. YOU, UH... YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE A BIRD. BUT WHEN YOU LEFT HERE ABOUT TWO MONTHS AGO, YOU WERE FEELING GREAT. AND YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE ON YOUR OWN EVER SINCE, DOING JUST FINE. SO WHAT HAPPENED? THE TROLLEY WAS CROWDED. I DIDN'T SLEEP WELL THE NIGHT BEFORE, AND THIS MAN WAS STARING AT ME. DID YOU GET DIZZY? NO, BUT AS SOON AS I SAT DOWN, I KNEW I WAS IN TROUBLE. WHY? WHAT DID YOU FEEL LIKE? PANICKY, AS THOUGH EVERYTHING WAS RUNNING AWAY FROM ME. HAVE YOU FELT THIS WAY ANY OTHER TIME SINCE YOU LEFT HERE? NO, AND I HAVEN'T WANTED TO BE A BIRD ONCE EITHER. I STOPPED TAKING THE THORAZINE A FEW WEEKS AGO. I WAS FEELING SO GOOD. SO, YOU'RE, UH... YOU'RE ON THE TROLLEY, AND YOU START TO FEEL PANICKY. WHAT HAPPENED THEN? I WALKED TO AN EMPTY SEAT AND SAT DOWN. I REMEMBER LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AND NOT RECOGNIZING WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT, NOT KNOWING WHERE I WAS. IT WAS SO FRIGHTENING. I GOT SCARED, AS THOUGH I WAS GONNA LOSE CONTROL LIKE BEFORE. BUT YOU DIDN'T. NO, I MANAGED TO GET HOME AND TAKE SOME THORAZINE. I JUST DON'T WANT THINGS TO FALL APART LIKE THEY DID BEFORE, DR. BEALE. JANE, THE FACT THAT YOU CAME BACK HERE ON YOUR OWN SAYS AN AWFUL LOT. I JUST DON'T WANT TO LOSE CONTROL. HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW? SAFE. GOOD. GOOD. YOU STORM IN, YOU GRAB A DANISH AND YOU GO RIGHT FOR THE JUGULAR. YOU HELD YOUR OWN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BUGGING YOU. I REALLY DON'T. WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER IN THE PAST. NO, WE HAVEN'T. THE ONLY DOCTOR I'VE WORKED WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS IS DANIEL AUSCHLANDER, AND HE WOULD NEVER HAVE ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY RECORD? SO THE PATIENT JUST DISAPPEARED? GREAT. THAT'S GREAT. ASK A STUPID QUESTION. EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME! EXCUSE ME! WILL EVERYONE SHUT UP FOR ONE LOUSY MINUTE? THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IT'S ONLY TAKEN ME 85 TIMES AND SHOUTING... TO GET YOU PEOPLE'S ATTENTION. BUT DOES ANYONE KNOW WHERE CAROL ALAIMO IS? - WHO? - WHO IS SHE? SORRY. DON'T KNOW. SORRY. NOBODY KNOWS WHERE SHE IS. SHE DISAPPEARED. I'M FINE. JUST GREAT. I MEAN, WHEN I WAS AT BERKELEY MEMORIAL, I DEALT WITH IT ALL. YOU'RE TALKIN' BIKERS, MAINLINERS, ACID FREAKS, HARD-CORE BURN-OUTS. I MEAN, HEAVY, HEAVY EAST BAY GREASE. BUT THIS PLACE IS BONKERS, DR. WESTPHALL. I MEAN, CLINICALLY, BEYOND EXTRADITION. HEY, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT... WHAT'S HER NAME? CAROL ALAIMO WAS TRANSFERRED TO BETH ZION? I'M NOT THE ATTENDING. I THINK I WOULD HAVE REACTED THE SAME WAY. IT'S LIKE WE'RE ALWAYS ON THE WRONG END OF AN OUTSIDE SET AT SANTA CRUZ. I'M OUT THERE SCRATCHING THE WATER, TRYING TO GET OUT TO GET THROUGH TO THE WAVE. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I SEE 15 OTHER SURFERS ON THEIR BOARDS, ONLY NONE OF THEM KNOW HOW TO SURF, YOU UNDERSTAND? THEY START WIPING OUT. THEY'RE CRASHING. BOARDS, BODIES, CORDS FALLING OVER EACH OTHER. ULTIMATELY I FEEL LIKE IT'S MY FAULT. I DON'T KNOW. BUT I'M NOT A FLAKE, DR. WESTPHALL. FLAKES DON'T GRADUATE FIRST IN THEIR CLASS, DOCTOR, NOT EVEN IN CALIFORNIA. SO, UH, HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP THROUGH ALL THIS? OKAY. WE'VE BEEN HEARING THESE RUMORS. THAT I'M ABOUT TO BE CANNED? BE DEPRESSING IF IT WERE TRUE. THANK YOU. HEY, THANK YOU, DR. WESTPHALL. SEE YOU LATER. HI, ALISA. YEAH, TWO THINGS. CALL MRS. CATALANO AND TELL HER TO TELL THE KIDS I CAN'T MAKE IT IN TIME FOR DINNER, BUT I'LL BE THERE BEFORE THEY GO TO BED. THEN CALL THE C.D.C. IN ATLANTA... 'CAUSE DR. BOROVAY SAID THOSE LEGIONNAIRES' TESTS SHOULD BE READY BY NOW. ALL RIGHT? THANK YOU. GIVE ME THE DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER AND AN ORDER OF FRIES. UH, LARGE APPLESAUCE AND, UH, SALTINES. IT'S MY STOMACH, MAN. IF I EAT ANYTHING ELSE, I'M LIABLE TO SPEND ALL DAY MOPPING UP AFTER MYSELF. YOU STILL DON'T FEEL ANY BETTER? I FEEL HOW THIS LOOKS. MOLLY SAYS THE BOARD SUSPENDED DR. WESTPHALL RIGHT AFTER THE MEETING. I DON'T BELIEVE IT! NEW HAIRDO. YOU'RE RELAXED. YOU'RE GLOWING. YOU'VE GOT A WELT ON YOUR NECK THE SIZE OF A GRAPEFRUIT. COME ON, DOCTOR. WHO'S THE LUCKY GUY? YOU HAVE AN IMPOVERISHED IMAGINATION. NO. IN FACT, I HAVE A FERTILE IMAGINATION. COMES IN HANDY AROUND 2:00 A.M. NOW THAT I'M POUNDING THE BOARDS AGAIN, IF YOU CATCH MY DRIFT. IT DIDN'T WORK OUT WITH CATHY MARTIN? NO, BUT THAT'S OKAY. I'M BACK WITH MY IMAGINARY LOVER. NO HASSLES. WE'RE VERY COMPATIBLE. SO, UH, DOES YOUR FRIEND HAVE A NAME? PATRICK McFARLAND. HE'S A FISHERMAN. A FISHERMAN NAMED PATRICK? SOMEHOW I CAN'T PICTURE YOU WITH A FISHERMAN NAMED PATRICK. WELL, HE'S A VERY INTERESTING GUY. HOW'D YOU MEET? WE HAD A BABY TOGETHER. THAT'S INTERESTING. OVER THE PHONE. HE GAVE ME HIS NUMBER, AND I CALLED IT. I'LL BET HE'S A WORKING-CLASS INTELLECTUAL. NO, JUST A REGULAR GUY THAT MAKES ME HAPPY. WELL, THEN I'M HAPPY FOR YOU, ANNIE. NO, I REALLY AM. WELL, THANK YOU. IT COULDN'T BE ME, IT MIGHT AS WELL BE A FISHERMAN WITH A BIG SKIFF. I KNEW IT. IS THE SMELL OF CARP CONDUCIVE TO... GOOD-BYE, FISCUS. GOOD-BYE. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE MYRA TO THE BAY TOWER ROOM? SHE'LL LOVE THE VIEW. THE FOOD'S NOT BAD EITHER. I CAN'T AFFORD THAT. PETER, IT'S YOUR WIFE'S BIRTHDAY. IF YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING NICE FOR HER TONIGHT, YOU'LL PAY FOR IT ALL YEAR LONG. TELL ME ABOUT IT. TONIGHT'S THE FIRST NIGHT I'VE HAD OFF SINCE FRIDAY. ALL I WANT TO DO IS I WANNA GO HOME, I WANNA GO TO SLEEP. JACK, I SAW THE NEW MEDICATION ORDER FOR JANE SONDELL. THAT'S THE ONE WHO THOUGHT SHE WAS A BIRD? YEAH. WHY'D YOU TAKE HER OFF THORAZINE? IT'S FAIRLY STANDARD PROCEDURE. STANDARD? FOR WHO? I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE ANY CHANGES. IT'S STANDARD PROCEDURE TO TAKE A PREGNANT WOMAN OFF THORAZINE. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU WERE PREGNANT? I DIDN'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT YOU. AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO JUDGE ME. WHO'S THE FATHER? HIS NAME IS BOB. WHERE'D YOU MEET HIM? WELL, I'VE BEEN DOING CLERICAL WORK IN AN OFFICE ALONG STORROW DRIVE. WHEN THE WEATHER'S NICE, I LIKE TO EAT MY LUNCH... ALONG THE CHARLES RIVER, NEAR THE HATCH. THERE WAS A GROUP FROM EMERSON COLLEGE PLAYING CHAMBER MUSIC THERE. QUARTET K. 465 BY MOZART, SUNRISE BY HAYDN. DO YOU KNOW THOSE QUARTETS? NO. I'M AFRAID NOT. THEY'RE LOVELY. AND IT WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY. THERE WERE CHILDREN AND DOGS AND PEOPLE EATING THEIR LUNCH. COUPLES. THE KIND OF DAY THAT MAKES YOU FEEL HAPPY TO BE ALIVE. AND THERE WAS THIS MAN. BOB. YES. AND HE STARTED TALKING TO ME. WE TALKED ABOUT THE MUSIC. HE WAS VERY HANDSOME AND CHARMING, AND HE KNEW SO MUCH. HE WAS VERY NICE TO ME. I DIDN'T GO BACK TO WORK THAT AFTERNOON. ARE YOU STILL SEEING EACH OTHER? NO. DOES HE KNOW THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT? NO. DON'T YOU THINK MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO TELL HIM? HE'S GONE. HE DOESN'T LIVE IN BOSTON. AH, IT'S MARKED CLEARLY THERE. I CAN SEE IT MYSELF. A LITTLE LOWER. YES. MR. GEORGE COOK, PLEASE RETURN TO YOUR ROOM. FRIED MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE. MY FAVORITE CUISINE. SO, YOU'RE GONNA EAT THAT HERE OR YOU TAKIN' IT OUT? WELL, I'M WAITING FOR DR. CAVANERO. SHE'S IN WITH A PATIENT. YOU MUST BE PATRICK. YEAH. WAYNE FISCUS, ANNIE'S BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WORLD. I'M SURE SHE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT ME. AS A MATTER OF FACT, SHE HASN'T.

ONCE YOU'VE LOCATED THE DISEASE, THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO ELIMINATE IT? YES, THAT'S RIGHT. I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER A WORD OF PRAISE FOR MY COLLEAGUES AT ST. ELIGIUS. THEY'VE PERFORMED EXTREMELY WELL IN A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION, AND I'D REALLY LIKE THEM TO KNOW HOW PROUD OF THEM I AM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DOCTOR. YOU BET YA. SO HERE AT ST.

SHE DIDN'T LIKE THE PRESENT I GOT HER FOR HER BIRTHDAY. WHAT'D YOU GET HER? A BOX OF CHOCOLATES. MAN, IF WE HADN'T FOUGHT ABOUT THAT, WE WOULD'VE FOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT WE DON'T EVEN NEED A REASON TO FIGHT. WE JUST FIGHT. TONIGHT I TRIED. LISTEN, TONIGHT I REALLY TRIED NOT TO. I'M SORRY. YEAH, ME TOO. OKAY. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T GET IT WET, OKAY? NO SWIMMING, NO SNORKELING. NO SHOWERS. TAKE A BATH. PLEASE. IT'S A... IT'S A JOKE. I FEEL LIKE HENNY YOUNGMAN PLAYING A HOUSE FULL OF AYATOLLAHS. ALL RIGHT. COME BACK IN 10 DAYS, AND I'LL TAKE OUT THE STITCHES. IN THE IMMORTAL WORDS OF DR. SEUSS... GET HIS WALLET! COME ON, COME ON! SO WHAT'D THE COPS SAY? THEY, UH, SUGGESTED I GET ANOTHER WALLET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WHAT DID THEY GET? NINE BUCKS, THREE 15Â¢ STAMPS, A PICTURE OF GRACIE SLICK... AND THE NUMBER I GOT OFF A GIRL I MET LAST THURSDAY NIGHT AT FANEUIL HALL. SPECIAL FAMILY BLEND? IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE, UM... HOW DO THEY SAY? A NEW MAN? WHY NOT? IF I FELT ANY WORSE, I'D BE DEAD. IF I FELT ANY BETTER, IT WOULDN'T BE ME. JOSH KARTON, THE TECHNICIAN OVER AT THE V.A.? HE GOT MUGGED WHILE TAKING A SET OF X-RAYS. IN BERKELEY, THREE DUDES ON HARLEYS CAME AFTER ME WITH TIRE IRONS... BECAUSE I REVIVED A GUY FROM A RIVAL BIKE GANG. YOU'RE LUCKY. ME? ALL YOUR PATIENTS ARE OUT COLD. SUCH A HEADACHE. GO HOME, GET SOME REST. I CAN'T. I GOTTA GO DOWNTOWN AND LOOK AT MUG SHOTS. WATCH IT, WILL YOU? HEY! NOT BARNES. BARNUM. "UM." A DEAF SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR. ANY SIGN OF MR. SCHULTZ'S WHITE BLOOD COUNT YET? I'LL SEND FOR IT. WE GOT A POSTCARD FROM DR. AUSCHLANDER. THAT'S NICE. WHAT'S IT SAY? EITHER I NEED GLASSES OR IT'S TOTALLY ILLEGIBLE. WANT TO TRY TRANSLATING? "CABO SAN LUCAS IS A DREAM. DON'T WAKE ME UP. BEST TO ALL." IT'S AN ACQUIRED SKILL. YOU EVER WORK WITH A DR. PAT BARNUM? NO. I'VE BEEN WAITING THREE HOURS. I GOT A MESSAGE FROM HIM. NOBODY CAN FIND HIM! MAYBE HE'S AT ANOTHER HOSPITAL. GET ME BOSTON GENERAL. HELEN, I'M SORRY, BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET MARTHA MULVAHEY RUN ME RAGGED TODAY. GOD, WHAT IS IT NOW? I DON'T KNOW. YES, MARTHA. WHAT IS IT? I KNOW I'M BEING A TERRIBLE BOTHER, BUT I'D REALLY LIKE TO GET MY HAIR WASHED. WE WASHED IT YESTERDAY. I KNOW, BUT IT FEELS DIRTY. LISTEN, HONEY, THERE ARE 45 NEW BEDS IN THIS WARD. IT'S VERY CROWDED, AND EVERYBODY'S VERY TIRED. I WOULDN'T EVEN ASK, BUT I CAN'T DO IT MYSELF. MARTHA, IT'S GONNA TAKE AT LEAST 40 MINUTES FOR SOMEONE TO WASH YOUR HAIR. WE CAN'T POSSIBLY WASH EVERY PATIENT'S HAIR EVERY DAY. THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH TO DO AND NOT ENOUGH OF US TO DO IT ALL. YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY. SINCE I'VE BEEN SICK, I CAN'T EVEN DO THE SIMPLEST THINGS MYSELF. I PROMISE I WON'T BE SUCH A BOTHER TO EVERYBODY ANYMORE. LOOK, THINGS ARE PRETTY HECTIC RIGHT NOW, BUT I'LL GET BACK WITHIN THE HOUR. WE'LL GET YOUR HAIR WASHED. I THINK IT'S AN INSIDE JOB. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. THERE'S NO MONEY IN IT. $6,000 WORTH OF SUPPLIES IS NOT EXACTLY PETTY CASH. IT IS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT ONE TAB OF METHAQUALONE... GOES FOR EIGHT BUCKS ON THE STREET. IF YOU WERE FEEDING THE BLACK MARKET, WOULD YOU LIFT TONGUE DEPRESSORS? THAT'S A GOOD POINT. YOU BETTER SEND CUMMINGS A TALLY SHEET. I DID. HE WILL NOT OKAY THE PAYMENTS. ALL RIGHT. I'LL TALK TO HIM. THANKS. OKAY, SWEETIE. DON'T CRY. I'LL GET YOU ANOTHER I.D. JUST AS SOON AS I CAN. WHAT DO YOU MEAN DR. BARNUM CALLED AGAIN? ALL THE MESSAGE SAID WAS, DR. BARNUM WANTS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT BUYING YOUR CAR. DID HE LEAVE A PHONE NUMBER? NOPE. WHY THE HELL DIDN'T HE LEAVE HIS PHONE NUMBER? ROONEY, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I GOT TO TELL YOU? I'M THE DOCTOR. YOU'RE THE ORDERLY, OKAY? YOU DO NOT... UNDERLINE... DO NOT HAVE LEGIONNAIRES'. YOU UNDERSTAND? WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS? IT'S A RASH ABOUT THE SIZE OF MY FIST. YEAH, THAT'S A RASH. YEAH. SOMETIMES... SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU GET REAL NERVOUS, YOUR SKIN REACTS BECAUSE YOUR MIND IS BUSY WITH OTHER THINGS. UNDERSTAND? NO. WELL, YOU'RE NOT SICK. TRUST ME. SO, OKAY, MAYBE I AIN'T GOT LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE. MAYBE I GOT SOMETHING WORSE. MAYBE SOMETHING YOU GUYS AIN'T EVEN DISCOVERED YET! COME ON, YOU MONSTER! WHERE IS MISS MUSCARELLA'S CHEMICAL PROFILE? LUTHER! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? WELL, I WAS HERE, AND I WAS OVER... OH, COME ON, LUTHER. DR. BEALE WANTS TO SEE YOU PRONTO. AND COME RIGHT BACK. MOVE IT! DR. PAT BARNUM. CHECK IT AGAIN! AND KEEP CHECKING TILL YOU FIND HIM! THE PATIENTS IN 435 SIGNED A PETITION COMPLAINING... ABOUT THE PAINT PEELING OFF THE WALL IN THEIR BATHROOM. OHH! FILE IT. NO! NO WONDER THEY CALL THIS A TERMINAL. OH! OH! GOD! SO, WHERE DO WE START, DR. BOROVAY? THE ORGANISM COULD BE LOCALIZED IN THESE SHOWERS HERE, OR THE FAUCETS, OR THE BED PAN FLUSHERS. IT'S THE NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK. THE LEGIONNAIRES', UH, THEY FOUND AT WADSWORTH V.A. IN CALIFORNIA... AND BELLVUE-STRATFORD... WAS TRACED TO THE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM, RIGHT? YES. I HAD ANOTHER CASE IN MICHIGAN WHERE WE FOUND IT IN THE STORAGE TANKS. BUT BECAUSE THE OUTBREAK HERE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO ONLY ONE WARD, IT PROBABLY ORIGINATED IN THAT WARD. SAMPLES WILL BE OBTAINED BY SWABBING EACH WATER OUTLET WITH A DACRON SWAB. IF THE POINT OF ORIGIN IS NOT FOUND TO BE ON THAT WARD, THEN THE ORGANISMS ARE UBIQUITOUS... AND THE ENTIRE WATER-DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM IS IRRECONCILABLY CONTAMINATED. WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN? IT WOULD MEAN THAT THE ENTIRE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE TO BE CLOSED DOWN. DON'T WORRY. WE'LL FIND IT. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU ACTED QUICKLY. YOU SHOULD BOTH BE CONGRATULATED. LOOKING FOR ME? AH, LUTHER, INDEED I AM. COME IN. COME IN. LUTHER, I'VE GOT A PROBLEM. YEAH? AND I THINK MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME OUT. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? DO YOU REMEMBER A PATIENT OF MINE FROM A WHILE BACK BY THE NAME OF JANE? SHE WAS THE GIRL WITH BIRD TENDENCIES. YEAH, SURE. SHE WAS HOOKED ON SUNFLOWER SEEDS. YEAH, RIGHT. WELL, SHE'S PREGNANT. AND THE PROBLEM IS, I THINK SHE WAS IMPREGNATED BY SOMEONE IN THIS HOSPITAL. OH, NO, DOC. I SWEAR I WOULDN'T... I KNOW IT WASN'T YOU, LUTHER. BUT I NEED YOUR HELP. MY HELP? LUTHER, I'VE BEEN AFFILIATED WITH THIS HOSPITAL FOR SEVERAL YEARS. DURING THAT TIME, I HAVE COME TO KNOW ITS INFORMATIONAL FLOW. KNOW WHAT I MEAN? NO. AH. WELL. WHEN YOU NEED HELP WITH A PERSONAL PROBLEM, YOU GO TO DR. WESTPHALL. WHEN YOU NEED TO GET SOMETHING DONE, YOU GO TO NURSE ROSENTHAL. BUT WHEN YOU NEED TO GET RIGHT DOWN TO THE DIRT, YOU GO TO THE EYES AND THE EARS OF THIS HOSPITAL. WHOA, DOC. WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO DO... IS TO SNOOP AND SNEAK AND PRY IN OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS. FIFTY DOLLARS. I'LL ASK AROUND. PHONE. THE COMPUTER MAN. GREAT. I'M SORRY, BUT WE DON'T LAUNDER PERSONAL CLOTHING. THAT'S WHY WE PROVIDE THE HOSPITAL GOWNS. UH, MRS. ALLEN, 413... SHE GET HER METOLAZONE? NOT YET, DOCTOR. WHAT'S THE HANG-UP? HAS MRS. O'FLAHERTY GONE TO BETH ZION TOO? MY DIABETIC HYPERTENSIVE? JERRY, THE LAST TIME IT BROKE DOWN, YOU SAID IT WOULD NEVER BREAK DOWN AGAIN. STOP RIGHT THERE, LUTHER! I DID CALL OUR MAIN COMPUTER OFFICE. ROSALIE TOLD ME TO CALL YOU. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO COME RIGHT BACK! THIS IS RIGHT BACK! I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT FROM YOU EITHER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE EVERY TIME IT BREAKS DOWN? THE MAN IN 411 WITH A PEPTIC ULCER ERUPTED AGAIN. YEAH. IT DOESN'T GET ANY MORE CRUEL OR UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT THAN THE REST OF US DO. YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. I AM TIRED OF EXCUSES. I WANT IT WORKING, AND I WANT IT WORKING NOW. MRS. VISSER WANTS A VASE FOR HER FLOWERS. I'VE GOT AN ASSIGNMENT FROM DR. BEALE. ASSIGNMENT? YEAH. TOMORROW? OH, JERRY. I'M GLAD YOU'RE NOT IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW. 412 AGAIN? MARTHA MULVAHEY. FIX IT, JERRY, FAST! LUTHER? FLOWERS! ULCER! DO YOU WANT ME TO GET THE CALL? NO. I'LL GO. WHAT IS IT, MARTHA? I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. YOU SAID THAT THE LAST TIME AND THE TIME BEFORE. WHAT IS IT NOW? I HAVE A FRIEND COMING TO SEE ME. COULD YOU HELP ME WITH MY MAKEUP? YOUR MAKEUP? FIRST IT WAS THE PILLOW, THEN THE BED, THEN YOUR HAIR NEEDED WASHING. NO MORE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NO MORE! WHAT DO YOU THINK WE DO AROUND HERE? THIS ISN'T A COUNTRY CLUB. NOW, LOOK, MARTHA. I AM VERY SORRY THAT YOU'VE GOT ARTHRITIS, AND I MEAN THAT. I'M VERY SORRY THAT THIS HAPPENED TO YOU. YOU'RE SICK, AND I KNOW THAT IT'S HARD FOR YOU, BUT WE CANNOT CATER TO YOUR EVERY NEED. YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY PATIENT IN THIS HOSPITAL. IF YOU KEEP CALLING LIKE THIS, NO ONE WILL RESPOND WHEN IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? WHEN IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT! RAMON LOPEZ GAVE YOU A VOUCHER. I NEED YOU TO SIGN IT. I'M AFRAID THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION. THAT'S GREAT. SO WE RUN OUT OF BAND-AIDS AND COTTON SWABS. WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO THEN? AS IS HOSPITAL POLICY, YOU WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR 90% OF FULL VALUE... AT THE START OF THE NEXT FISCAL QUARTER. THEN FREE THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION. WHAT SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION? YOU KNOW DAMN WELL WHAT IT IS. WAS. OUR CONTINGENCY MONIES WERE SPENT ON THIS FIASCO. I SEE. SO YOU'RE GONNA WITHHOLD THE MONEY TO PUNISH ME FOR SHUTTING DOWN THAT WARD. THAT'S NOT IT AT ALL. IF I HAD BEEN WRONG, I COULD UNDERSTAND YOUR RESENTMENT. BUT I WASN'T WRONG. THIS HOSPITAL AVERTED WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A MAJOR EPIDEMIC. YOU'VE DONE A HELL OF A JOB, DONALD. I HOPE OTHER PEOPLE REMEMBER WHAT A GOOD JOB YOU'VE DONE SEVEN MONTHS DOWN THE LINE... WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR THE NEW CAT SCAN... OR WE LOSE OUR BACKING FROM THE ZELLMAN FOUNDATION... ALL BECAUSE OF THE TERRIFIC JOB YOU'VE DONE. FUND-RAISING HAS NEVER BEEN ONE OF ST. ELIGIUS'S... STRONGER ASPECTS. BOSTON GENERAL AND BENT BRIGHAM... THEY USUALLY GET FIRST CRACK AT THE HEAVY HITTERS. NOTORIETY DOES NOT INSPIRE CONFIDENCE. AND WE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THE NOTORIETY... IF WE JUST KEPT THE NEWS QUIET UNTIL THE C.D.C. HAD MADE THE FINAL REPORT. C.D.C. REPORTS DON'T MAKE HEADLINES. C.D.C. REPORTS DON'T MAKE THE EVENING NEWS. HUGH? HUGH. DO YOU KNOW A DR. BARNUM? DON'T THINK SO. HE'S NOT HERE OR AT BOSTON GENERAL... OR OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL SORROWS. WHAT'S THE MATTER? IS YOUR BACK BOTHERING YOU AGAIN? NO, MY CAR. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SELL IT FOR WEEKS. ELLEN WANTS A NEW ONE FOR HER BIRTHDAY. WE DON'T NEED THREE CARS! DO YOU HAPPEN KNOW A PHYSICIAN NAMED PAT BARNUM? MALE OR FEMALE? GOOD QUESTION. OPEN YOUR MOUTH, MR. COLLINS. IT'S TIME TO TAKE YOUR PILL. I'M NOT KIDDING. I'M GONNA STAND RIGHT HERE UNTIL I SEE YOU SWALLOW IT. WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM? NOTHING I CAN'T HANDLE. TAKE YOUR PILL, MR. COLLINS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY ROOM ANYHOW? HUH? DON'T PUSH! PLEASE DON'T! I'LL PUSH YOU IF I WANT TO! COME ON. I'LL KILL HIM! TELL ME THIS CHAOS WILL END. THIS CHAOS WILL END. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. LOOK, MR. COLLINS, IF YOU WANT TO GET BETTER, YOU GOTTA TAKE YOUR PILL. OKAY. THERE WE ARE. THANK YOU. WAYNE. WAYNE. I HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. SURE. I REMEMBER AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES I GOT MUGGED, I BEGAN TO THINK IT WAS MY FAULT. YOU START LOOKIN' OVER YOUR SHOULDER A WHOLE LOT MORE. YEAH, I GUESS SO. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. WELL, UH, IT'S GOOD TO BE SEEN. IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU, LET ME KNOW. THANKS. MARTHA? DID YOU HAVE A NICE VISIT WITH YOUR FRIEND? I OVERHEARD TWO OF THE NURSES TALKING ABOUT ME, TRYING TO BE NICE. "WELL, SHE'S GOT PRETTY HAIR." PRETTY HAIR. OH, GOD. FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS IT'S BEEN GETTING WORSE AND WORSE. I CAN'T EVEN TURN THE PAGES OF A BOOK. I AM SO ANGRY! MAR... DON'T! I DON'T WANT HIM TO SEE ME LIKE THIS. HE'S NOT GOING TO. WE ARE GOING TO MAKE YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL. MARK, I JUST SPENT $600 ON A NEW TRANSMISSION. JAP CAR. IT FIGURES. WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? BUY AMERICAN. WHY DON'T YOU BUY HIS CAR? MY UNCLE JIMBO ONCE SAID, "NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM A MAN WHO COULD SOMEDAY OPERATE ON YOU." BESIDES, SOME GUY NAMED BARNUM WANTS TO BUY IT. NO, HE DOESN'T. YOU SEE, UM, I'M BARNUM. I FOUND HIM. â™ª BLACKBIRD SINGING IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT â™ª â™ª TAKE THESE BROKEN WINGS AND LEARN TO FLY â™ª â™ª ALL YOUR LIFE â™ª â™ª YOU WERE ONLY WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT TO ARISE â™ª â™ª BLACKBIRD, FLY â™ª â™ª BLACKBIRD, FLY â™ª â™ª INTO THE LIGHT OF THE DARK BLACK NIGHT â™ª â™ª BLACKBIRD SINGING IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT â™ª IT'S ROCKIN' RALPH. THAT'S THE REASON JANE CAME BACK. RALPH'S THE GUY THAT'S BEEN STEALING ALL THE SUPPLIES. THEY'RE BUILDING A NEST. I CAN SEE THAT. AND SHE'S GONNA HAVE A BABY IN THERE. LUTHER. â™ª BLACKBIRD â™ª THEY'RE IN LOVE. â™ª BLACKBIRD, FLY â™ª â™ª INTO THE LIGHT OF THE DARK BLACK NIGHT â™ª â™ª BLACKBIRD SINGING IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT â™ª â™ª TAKE THESE SUNKEN EYES AND LEARN TO SEE â™ª â™ª ALL YOUR LIFE â™ªâ™ª COME IN. EXCUSE ME. I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR GETTING THE MONEY TO COVER THOSE STOLEN SUPPLIES. AS IT TURNS OUT, WE RECOVERED MOST OF THEM. THEY WERE, UH, MISPLACED. KEEP IT. COULD BE A LONG WINTER. I, UH, THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID. IT SEEMS IT'S EASY TO FORGET THAT OUR OBJECTIVES ARE THE SAME. IT'S JUST THAT YOU AND I GO AT THEM FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT ANY DIFFERENCES I HAD WITH YOU IN THE PAST ARE NOT PERSONAL. THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IS SIMPLE: RUNNING THIS HOSPITAL, MAKING IT WORK, IS A BUSINESS. BUT TO YOU DOCTORS, IT'S A CALLING. YOU'D RATHER REMOVE YOURSELVES FROM THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE, FROM THE PEDESTRIAN, DAILY, MUNDANE WORK. THE BUSINESS OF MEDICINE IS BUSINESS. SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I REALIZE THIS WHOLE THING HAS CAUSED YOU ENORMOUS PROBLEMS. I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WHAT'S THIS? YOUR RÃ‰SUMÃ‰. WHEN AN INSTITUTION FAILS TO FUNCTION SMOOTHLY, SOMEONE'S GOTTA TAKE A FALL. THE ADMINISTRATOR IS A LIKELY CANDIDATE. OH, THEY WON'T FIRE YOU. A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IS USUALLY A GOOD INDICATION THAT A CHANGE IS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE. KNOWING THE BOARD, THEY'LL WAIT UNTIL THE C.D.C. RELEASES ITS REPORT, TILL THE HEAT DIES DOWN. MAYBE THEY'LL HOLD OFF UNTIL THE ANNUAL CONVENTION IN CHICAGO... WHATEVER. BUT... I WILL BE REPLACED. THE SERUM AMYLASE COME IN YET? NO. ABOUT 20 MORE MINUTES. HMM. THE CYST IS RECEDING. TWO DAYS AGO HE'D HAVE WOKE UP HOWLING. TO THINK I ALMOST RECOMMENDED SURGERY. THAT'D HAVE BEEN A MAJOR BLUNDER. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE? UH, NO. NURSE. UM, LOOK, UH, I'M VERY SORRY. I MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE AT YOUR EXPENSE. AND... I WANT TO APOLOGIZE. I'VE BEEN 20 YEARS WITH THIS HOSPITAL, YOUNG MAN. TWENTY YEARS. THAT'S PRACTICALLY AS LONG AS YOU'VE BEEN ON THIS PLANET. MY WAY OF DOING THINGS MAY NOT BE TO YOUR LIKING, BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE RIGHT TO ATTACK MY ABILITY. TWENTY YEARS. YES, MA'AM. HERE'S ADVICE FROM AN OLD LADY... WHO HAS SEEN MANY YOUNG MEN COME AND GO. PICK YOUR FRIENDS WITH GREAT CARE. THERE'S SO MANY OUT THERE WHO WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU FAIL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CAN I HELP YOU? UH, YEAH. I WANT TO BUY A GUN. UH, WHAT KIND? THE KIND THAT SHOOTS. DONALD? HI. I THOUGHT YOU OUGHT TO KNOW, MRS. AGUIRRE IS LIKING HER MEDICATION JUST A LITTLE TOO MUCH. I GAVE GLORIA THE NEW MEDICATION ORDERS. FINE. AH! YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE. SORRY, PAL. IT'S FOR MY SON. AH. IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY TODAY. TEN YEARS OLD. OH! AND I MISSED THE PARTY. OH, IT HAPPENS. IT HAPPENS MORE OFTEN THAN IT SHOULD. THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS OF A HOSPITAL ARE A POOR EXCUSE FOR MISSING A BIRTHDAY PARTY, AS FAR AS A 10-YEAR-OLD'S CONCERNED. IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING, ISN'T IT? YEP. YOU KNOW, I WAS... I WAS THINKING ABOUT MY FATHER. HE WAS A SCHOOLTEACHER, SOUTH BOSTON. A SHANTY ENGLISHMAN TEACHING SHANTY IRISH KIDS. DAD BELIEVED THAT NO ONE IS INSIGNIFICANT, EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT NOT BE THE BRIGHTEST PERSON IN THE WORLD... OR IT MIGHT HAVE A PERSONALITY THAT YOU CAN'T GET ALONG WITH. IT DIDN'T MATTER. HE WAS STILL IMPORTANT. HE'S STILL A HUMAN BEING. AND WE'RE OBLIGATED TO HELP HIM. POP REALLY ENJOYED WORKING WITH PEOPLE. HE WAS GOOD AT IT. I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING... I DON'T FEEL THAT WAY EVERY DAY. OH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. THAT'S WHAT WE KEEP COMING BACK TO, ISN'T IT? YEAH. SEE, WHEN I WAS A BOY, I FELT THAT THAT TIME DAD SPENT WITH OTHER PEOPLE WAS TIME TAKEN AWAY FROM ME. I RESENTED IT. I REALLY DID. I SWORE TO MYSELF... I PROMISED MYSELF... THAT I WOULD NEVER ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN TO MY OWN CHILDREN. BUT I CAN SEE THE PATTERN. MY KIDS ARE GROWING UP, HELEN. I CAN SEE THEM LEAVING. I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL SLIPPING AWAY SOMEHOW. DO YOU KNOW? OH, DONALD, IT'S TOUGH ENOUGH WORKING AND RAISING KIDS WHEN THERE ARE TWO OF YOU. IT MUST BE TWICE AS HARD FOR YOU. YEAH. - YOU LOOK BEAT, MY FRIEND. - I AM. - LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. - ALL RIGHT. WELL, I GUESS I'LL MAKE MACARONI AND CHEESE FOR DI... YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS. WHEN IN DOUBT, PIZZA. WHAT A GOOD IDEA. THANKS. YEAH. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? JUST WANT TO GO UP AND CHECK ON A PATIENT BEFORE I GO. WELL, MINE'S HERE. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH. SEE YOU LATER. GOOD NIGHT. - HI, DAD. - HI, KID. BOY, ARE YOU A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES. GIVE ME A HUG, WILL YOU? OH, BOY. OH, BOY. HOW WAS THE PARTY? OH, IT WAS OKAY. TOMMY STILL UP? NO, HE'S OUT LIKE A LIGHT. YOU TIRED? YEAH. ME TOO. LET'S GO, HUH?
