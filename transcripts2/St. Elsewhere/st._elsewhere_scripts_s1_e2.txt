REINHARDT IN 1122... HOW LONG HAS HIS LIGHT BEEN ON? CONSTANTLY. WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT? HE'S BEEN SITTING UP IN BED SMOKING CIGARETTES ALL NIGHT. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME HE WAS MEDICATED? - 50 P.M. I TOLD HIM TO KEEP HIS LEG ELEVATED. HE'S NOT GONNA LISTEN, I GOT NO TEARS. HIS WAY IS, "GIVE ME DEMEROL, GIVE ME THE MORPHINE." "DEMEROL 75 MILLIGRAMS, VISTARIL 75 MILLIGRAMS, Q4 HOURS, P.R.N. PAIN." EVERY FOUR HOURS, SKILLING. HE'S BEEN DUE FOR OVER HALF AN HOUR. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN FREE YOURSELF TO GIVE HIM HIS MEDICATION?

 I GOT 32 PATIENTS TO COVER, DR. MORRISON, AND ONLY TWO HANDS. MR. REINHARDT BLEW UP A BANK AND TWO PEOPLE DIED. AND THE LADY UPSTAIRS IN I.C.U. IS VERY CRITICAL. - I'LL GET TO HIM WHEN I GET THE CHANCE. - GIVE IT TO ME. I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAD SUCH A SOFT SPOT FOR TERRORISM. I DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T LIKE YOUR JOB, SKILLING. JUST DO IT. I'LL CALL YOU THE NEXT TIME HE RINGS FOR ASSISTANCE, DR. MORRISON. ALL RIGHT, JUST ROLL OVER A LITTLE BIT. THIS WILL EASE THE PAIN. WHERE'S WESTPHALL? THIS PRESS CONFERENCE HAS DRAGGED ON LONG ENOUGH. I WANNA GO GET SOMETHIN' TO EAT BEFORE I'M 30. DR. WESTPHALL, WILL REINHARDT BE IN ANY CONDITION TO STAND TRIAL? WELL, AS WE STATED PREVIOUSLY, ANDREW REINHARDT SUSTAINED MULTIPLE ABRASIONS, A CONCUSSION, SEVERAL SMALL FACIAL LACERATIONS. HE'S IN SOME PAIN, BUT, UH... BUT HE'S IN NO PRESENT DANGER. WE CONSIDER HIS CONDITION TO BE SATISFACTORY. IS REINHARDT ACTING AS AN INDIVIDUAL OR AS A MEMBER OF A TERRORIST GROUP? I DON'T KNOW. YOU'D HAVE TO TALK TO THE POLICE OR THE F.B.I. WAS THERE A SPECIFIC REASON WHY HE SET OFF A BOMB IN THE BANK? I'M SORRY. I CAN'T ANSWER ANY OF THESE QUESTIONS. I'M HERE TO GIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION. COULD YOU GIVE US THE NAME OF THE VICTIM... THE WOMAN THAT YOU'RE TREATING? YES. HER NAME IS KATHERINE McALLISTER. SHE'S 32 YEARS OLD. SHE'S FROM MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA. - WHAT'S HER STATUS? - WELL, SHE'S LISTED AS SERIOUS. WELL, THAT'S NOT EXACTLY CORRECT, DONALD. WE CONSIDER HER CONDITION TO BE CRITICAL. SHE WAS TECHNICALLY DEAD WHEN SHE ARRIVED HERE. UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF DR. BEN SAMUELS, OUR TRAUMA TEAM INITIATED EMERGENCY LIFE-SUPPORT MEASURES... WHICH RESULTED IN REVIVING HER VITAL SIGNS. DR. SAMUELS. DID YOU ACTUALLY BRING KATHERINE McALLISTER BACK FROM THE DEAD? WELL, UH, IN A CLINICAL SENSE, I SUPPOSE YOU CAN SAY THAT'S TRUE, YEAH. HAVE YOU BEEN INVOLVED IN CASES SUCH AS THIS BEFORE? YES, I HAVE. THIS, UH... ACTUALLY, UH, DR. CRAIG... HAS HAD FAR MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THIS SORT OF THING THAN I HAVE. HUNDREDS OF TIMES. AS I WAS SAYING, KATHERINE McALLISTER SUSTAINED ABDOMINAL WOUNDS... WITH INTRA-ABDOMINAL HEMORRHAGE. HOW LONG DID YOU OPERATE ON HER, DR. CRAIG? IN POINT OF FACT, I WAS NOT THE SURGEON OF RECORD. BUT AS DEPARTMENT CHAIRMAN OF SURGERY, I WAS IN CONSTANT COMMUNICATION WITH THE SURGERY TEAM... AND SERVED IN A SUPERVISORY CAPACITY. NOW, THAT IS NOT TO SAY... THAT I WAS HOLDING THE SURGEONS' HANDS. BUT MY BOYS ARE THE BEST. I'D PUT THEM UP AGAINST ANY BIG-NAME TEAM IN THE COUNTRY. BOSTON GENERAL MAY HAVE ITS MATINÉE IDOLS AND ART GALLERY WALLS, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BREAD-AND-BUTTER MEDICAL CARE, THERE ISN'T A HOSPITAL IN THIS STATE THAN CAN BEAT US. WE HAVE OUR HAND ON THE PULSE OF THIS CITY. NOW, WE ARE AWARE OF THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF OUR INSTITUTION, WHICH HAS BEEN FOSTERED BY YOU GENTLEMEN AS A SECOND-RATE HOSPITAL. NOW, I AM SICK OF HEARING THIS HOSPITAL... SNIDELY REFERRED TO AS "ST. ELSEWHERE." LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. ST. ELIGIUS ISN'T ELSEWHERE. THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE. WHAT WERE THE SURGICAL PROCEDURES, DR. CRAIG? I WAS GETTING TO THAT. HEY! LISTEN UP. NOW, FIRST WE DID AN EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY. YOU MEAN HE WASN'T HOLDING YOUR HAND? THE MAN NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE ME. NOW, THE SPLEEN HAD BEEN RUPTURED HERE AND HERE. IT'S INSANE. WE'RE ON CALL EVERY OTHER DAY. THAT'S 36 ON AND 12 OFF, AND THE 36 CAN DRAG ON TO BE EVEN MORE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I THINK I'M KILLING PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BACKUP. COME ON, PHIL. THE SENIOR RESIDENTS CAN'T BACK US UP. THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME. THEY JUST FINISHED OPERATING ON SIX PEOPLE IN THE LAST TWO NIGHTS. NOW THEY'RE GETTING SOME SLEEP TO OPERATE ON THE NEXT GUY. THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME. IT'S ECONOMICS. I HAD TO BORROW $60,000 TO MAKE IT THROUGH MEDICAL SCHOOL. THAT MEANS I'M GONNA BE PAYING OFF $500 A MONTH FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS. WHERE ARE THE VIOLINS? I KNOW IT'S ROUGH WHEN YOUR OLD MAN PUTS YOU THROUGH. NOT REALLY. GOOD MORNING. DR. ARMSTRONG, HOW'S MR. GORSKY? WE RULED OUT OSTEO, AND DECIDED IT WAS JUST A SOFT TISSUE INFECTION... THAT WE'VE BEEN TREATING WITH I.V. ANTIBIOTICS. HOW'S HE BEEN RESPONDING? AS FAR AS THE INFECTION GOES, FINE, BUT HE'S GETTING REALLY ABUSIVE AND HE'S THREATENING TO WALK OUT. SOUNDS LIKE MR. GORSKY IS SUFFERING FROM CABIN FEVER. THREE WEEKS IN BED WITH AN INFECTED TOE. IF THE ANTIBIOTICS HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATE, WHY DON'T WE JUST GIVE HIM THE EQUIVALENT IN P.O. MEDS AND SEND HIM ON HIS WAY. HALLELUJAH. DR. WHITE, HOW IS OUR HYPERTENSIVE MR. LINDLEY DOING? NOT VERY WELL. HE'S SHAKING THE D.T.'s, BUT WE STILL NEED TO GET A HANDLE ON THE BLOOD PRESSURE. WHAT MEDICATION HAS HE BEEN ON? HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, 50 MILLIGRAMS B.I.D. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED TRYING PROPRANOLOL? YES, SIR. FORTY MILLIGRAMS T.I.D. INTERMITTENTLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. MORNING, MR. LINDLEY. THE HOURS. OH, THE HOURS. I USED TO FANTASIZE ABOUT SEX. NOW ALL I DREAM ABOUT IS SLEEP. I'M LOSING MY RABID IMPULSES. SHE HAD A ROUGH NIGHT. WHO'S THAT? KATHERINE McALLISTER, THE BOMB VICTIM. HER NEURO STATUS IS THE SAME? LET ME CHECK. UH, STILL IN COMA. GLASGOW SCORE HAS IMPROVED. OCCASIONALLY VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT, AND HER LEFT PUPIL CAME DOWN. WHAT ABOUT HER HUSBAND? DID THEY LOCATE HIM? THEY GOT HIM LATE LAST NIGHT. HE'S FLYING IN FROM EUROPE THIS MORNING. NO INFILTRATES? NO CARDIOMEGALY? NO, HER HEART SIZE IS NORMAL. MM-HMM. MAYBE SHE THREW A PULMONARY EMBOLISM. IS SHE AN HYSTERIC? NO, SHE'S HOMESICK. SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO GO HOME. A POOR INSPIRATORY FILM. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT. ONLY DOWN TO EIGHT. GOOD MORNING, DR. CRAIG. GET ANOTHER P.A. VIEW. WHAT ABOUT A LATERAL? EXCUSE ME. MR. BROADWATER, HOW ARE WE THIS MORNING? FEELING PRETTY GOOD. WELL, I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS AND I HAVE SOME BAD. TWO OF THE MAJOR VESSELS TO YOUR HEART, THE LEFT ANTERIOR DESCENDING ARTERY... AND THE CIRCUMFLEX ARTERY, ARE 90% OBSTRUCTED. BUT I FEEL FINE. YOU DIDN'T FEEL FINE WHEN YOU HAD THOSE CHEST PAINS WALKING UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS, DID YOU? DID I HAVE A HEART ATTACK? NO, BUT WHEN WE PUT YOU ON THE TREADMILL, YOUR ELECTROCARDIOGRAM INDICATED ISCHEMIA. AND THE ANGIOGRAPHY. DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE PUT THE DYE THROUGH THE HEART? REVEALED OBSTRUCTIONS. VERY SERIOUS OBSTRUCTIONS. NINETY PERCENT OBSTRUCTED? LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING, MR. BROADWATER. WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE TO YOU? A RUBBER TUBE. ARTERIES ARE TUBES. THEY CARRY THE BLOOD AND OXYGEN FROM THE HEART. NOW, BEAR WITH ME. IF WE OBSTRUCT THE FLOW OF BLOOD AND OXYGEN TO THE BRAIN, WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS? I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. I'M ONLY 40 YEARS OLD HERE. YOU'RE FAT, YOU SMOKE. YOUR FATHER DIED OF A HEART ATTACK WHEN HE WAS 42. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING... YOU'RE WALKING A TIGHTROPE, MR. BROADWATER. IF IT ISN'T THE STAIRS TODAY, IT'LL BE WASHING THE CAR TOMORROW, OR BOUNCING YOUR LITTLE BOY ON YOUR KNEE, OR IF YOU'RE LUCKY, WHEN YOU'RE SLEEPING. OH, MY DEAR GOD. NOW FOR THE GOOD NEWS. I'M GOING TO SAVE YOU. HOW? TRIPLE BYPASS. SURGERY? WE'LL GIVE YOU A FEW MOMENTS TO THINK ABOUT IT, NOTIFY YOUR LOVED ONES. DO I HAVE YOUR COMPLETE COOPERATION? I GUESS SO. EXCELLENT. WHAT'S THE MATTER, LAVINE? IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS AND REINHARDT STILL WON'T EAT. OKAY. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? THE FOOD STINKS. IT STINKS FOR EVERYBODY. IS THIS SOME KIND OF PROTEST? YOU'RE A REAL QUICK STUDY. LISTEN. IF YOU'RE THINKING HUNGER STRIKE, FORGET IT. WE DON'T LOOK VERY KINDLY ON ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THE PAPERWORK. IF WE HAVE TO, WE'RE GONNA STICK A TUBE DOWN YOUR NOSE, INTO YOUR STOMACH, AND FEED YOU THAT WAY. THAT WON'T TASTE VERY GOOD EITHER, BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING TO STARVE. IF I WANT TO, I'LL PULL THEM OUT. AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, WE'LL PUT MAIN LINES RIGHT INTO YOUR VEINS. AND IF YOU PULL THOSE OUT, WE'LL PUT YOU IN RESTRAINTS, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS. WISE GUY. LISTEN. WHAT WE DID WAS IRRATIONAL, YES, BUT IT WAS SPONTANEOUS. IT WAS BASED ON PURE EMOTION AND STRONG MUTUAL ATTRACTION. PERSONALLY, IT WAS INCREDIBLY SATISFYING, AND NEITHER OF US HAS ANYTHING TO BE ASHAMED OR GUILTY ABOUT. OH, WAYNE. YOU'RE SO GOOD. AND I'M... SO BAD. NO. I'M BAD. I'M SO BAD, I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU. NO, YOU'RE NOT. YES, I AM. NO. I'M BAD... AND YOU'RE SO GOOD. NO, CATHY, I'M... I'M NOT... SO GOOD. SO GOOD. I'M... I'M NOT. YOU'RE THE BEST, WAYNE. I'M NOT. VERY... BAD. I'M NOT. SO, JANE, HOW ARE WE FEELING TODAY? OH. I SEE WE'RE TWEETY TODAY. YOU KNOW, I WAS HOPING THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE JANE TODAY. BUT I GUESS WE'RE NOT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE. WHAT KIND OF BIRD ARE WE? ARE WE A SPARROW? NO, NO, NO, NO. WE'RE MUCH TOO PRETTY TO BE A PLAIN OLD SPARROW. HMM. A ROBIN? I DIDN'T THINK SO. WELL, I DON'T GET IT, TWEETY. I GIVE UP. AGAIN. UM, A MOCKINGBIRD. A MOCKINGBIRD! WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG, DR. BEALE? THAT'S THE STATE BIRD OF MISSISSIPPI, YOUR HOME STATE. THAT'S VERY GOOD. THAT'S VERY GOOD. WHAT HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND? I WAS MARRIED TO MARLON BRANDO, BUT HE DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY I SPOKE FRENCH. TIME GOES ROUND AND ROUND. WHO PUT THOSE STUPID CLOCKS IN THIS PLACE ANYWAY? MARLON BRANDO LOVES DARK WOMEN BECAUSE HE CAN'T SEE THEM. YOUR FATHER STILL HASN'T CALLED? FEAR OF FLYING CAN BE A REAL PROBLEM. WELL, I GUESS WE'RE ALL AFRAID OF SOMETHING OR OTHER. YEAH, BUT FOR A BIRD IT CAN BE DISASTROUS. WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF? WELL, I'M NOT TOO FOND OF WATER. SO WE ORDERED A SECOND P.A. AND LATERAL. UH-HUH. SO AUSCHLANDER CALLS IN VOLCKER AND RAGUSSA. UH-HUH. UH-HUH. WHAT DID THEY SAY? THEY DIDN'T. HUH? NAPKINS. THEY GOT US WEARING PAPER NAPKINS IN THE O.R. LOOK AT THIS. IT STARTED WITH DIAPERS AND WORKED ITS WAY RIGHT UP TO SURGICAL LINENS. I LOVE PROGRESS. HOW'S THE WOMAN YOU OPERATED ON, THAT ONE IN THE BANK? SHE MADE IT OFF THE TABLE, BUT THE PROGNOSIS IS, UH, MARGINAL. THE TERRORIST, WHAT'S-HIS-NAME, THAT'S YOUR PATIENT, RIGHT? I HEAR HE'S A REAL DELIGHT. YOU HAVE NO IDEA. WELL, TWO THINGS YOU DON'T CHOOSE: YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR PATIENTS. CHEER UP. IT'LL GET WORSE. DR. DERWIN, PLEASE COME TO RECOVERY. DR. DERWIN. SHE'S 11 YEARS OLD, AND SHE'S GOT A BODY LIKE SOPHIA LOREN. COME ON, FISCUS. I'M SERIOUS. I SEE IT ALL THE TIME. THIS IS JUST A THEORY, BUT YOU SEE IT ALL THE TIME. NINE, 10-YEAR-OLD GIRLS, BODIES BY FISHER. WHEN I WAS IN THE FIFTH GRADE, I DO NOT REMEMBER GIRLS LOOKING LIKE THAT. AS FAR AS I REMEMBER THE FIRST GIRL THAT STRUCK ME THAT WAY WAS BEEBEE WELNITZ... AND THAT WAS IN THE NINTH GRADE. - HAMBURGERS? - EXACTLY. THOSE FAST-FOOD HAMBURGER JOINTS. THEY FATTEN THE CATTLE WITH ESTROGEN. HORMONES, 'CAUSE IT'S MORE ECONOMICAL. IT'S ALL ECONOMICS. LIFE AND DEATH IS ECONOMICS. AND HAMBURGERS. YOU COULDN'T AFFORD TO BUY A HAMBURGER IF THEY DIDN'T FATTEN THE CATTLE WITH ESTROGEN. WHERE DOES IT GO? IT STAYS IN THE MEAT. IT DOESN'T ALL GET METABOLIZED, DOESN'T ALL GET PASSED THROUGH THE CATTLES' URINE. IT'S STILL IN THE MEAT, AND THAT, MY FELLOW WORKERS, IS WHY WE SEE THESE PREPUBESCENT GIRLS... NINE, 10 YEARS OLD... WITH DEVELOPED BREASTS. IT ISN'T QUITE READY FOR THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE, BUT... AND NOT ONLY THAT, I'LL BET THAT ESTROGEN IS CAUSING A RISE IN TESTICULAR CANCER IN BOYS. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, FISCUS! SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? HAS DR. BURGESS SEEN THIS? I DIDN'T WANT TO BOTHER HIM. SINCE HE'S THE BEST RADIOLOGIST WE'VE GOT, I THINK HE OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK. NO BOOKS AT THE TABLE, EHRLICH. IT TASTES TOO MUCH LIKE THE FOOD. IT'S VERY CONFUSING. I'M SCRUBBING WITH CRAIG THIS AFTERNOON. OH, YEAH? THAT'S VERY INTERESTING. HOPE YOU'RE UP ON THE VASCULAR ANATOMY OF THE HEART. I'M WORKIN' ON IT. I SAW HIM THROW A SCALPEL AT A RESIDENT ONCE WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT DOWN. HE JUST NICKED HIM. A COUPLE OF STITCHES. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE. HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN? IT'S BEEN OVER AN HOUR. MR. AND MRS. REINHARDT? YES. I'M DOCTOR MORRISON. HOW DO YOU DO? HI. I'M TREATING YOUR SON. HOW IS HE? WELL, HE'S, UH... CAN WE TALK IN THERE? PLEASE. I'M SORRY I'M LATE. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING? WOULD YOU LIKE COFFEE? NO, I'M FINE. WE JUST WANNA KNOW HOW HE IS. WE'D JUST LIKE TO KNOW HOW... HE'S IN PAIN. OF COURSE DR. DILLER PUTS DOWN IN THE REPORT THAT MR. FRANCIS IS DOING FINE. HIS BOWELS ARE DOING WONDERFULLY. IT'S HIS HIVES THAT ARE KILLING HIM. MY NURSE TELLS DR. DILLER THE OLD MAN IS GONNA KILL HIMSELF IF HE DOESN'T GET RELIEF. DR. DILLER LOOKS AT MR. FRANCIS AND ALL HE SEES IS BOWELS. BOWEL VISION. THEN HE DRESSES MY NURSE DOWN FOR WRITING A REPORT ON HIS HIVES... WHEN HE WAS ADMITTED FOR HIS BOWELS. ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME? HE STILL HAS BABY FAT, FOR PETE'S SAKE. MR. FRANCIS? ANDREW REINHARDT. I'M TALKING TO YOU ABOUT MR. FRANCIS. I KNOW, I KNOW. DO YOU SUPPOSE THE HIVES COULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE OPERATION? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I DON'T KNOW. SOME ALLERGIC REACTION? TO WHAT? I DON'T KNOW! YOU'RE A DOCTOR. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. DONALD. THE NEW F.B.I. FIRST, IT'S MUSTACHES, THEN HOT TUBS, THEN CREATIVE DIVORCE. I BEG YOUR PARDON? THE F.B.I. IS CONCERNED ABOUT SECURITY. I TOLD THEM NOT TO WORRY. WE'RE GONNA MOVE REINHARDT TO THE JAIL WARD... AS SOON AS THERE IS AN EMPTY BUNK. LOOK, YOU'VE GOT TO RINSE THE MOP BEFORE YOU DO THAT. YOU'LL GET DIRT ALL OVER THE FLOOR. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? THE WATER'S FILTHY ANYWAY. I SUGGEST YOU GO INTO THE BATHROOM... HEY, MAN, YOU ARE NOT MY BOSS. I'M NOT ON YOUR CASE! I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THIS THING RIGHT! JUST GET OFF MY CASE, MAN! SHUT UP! BEN? - BEN? - WHAT? YOU LOOK TERRIBLE. SURGERY LAST NIGHT? NO, I WAS IN AN ALL-NIGHT CARD GAME OUT IN ESSEX. OH. POKER? NO, CRAZY EIGHTS. WELL, I... I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY... A BAD TIME TO ASK FOR A FAVOR, HUH? RIGHT. I'D LIKE TO LEARN HOW TO SWIM. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM? NOPE. BUT YOUR OLD MAN WAS A SHRIMPER. ALL THOSE STORIES ABOUT THE GULF OF MEXICO AND SHRIMP, AND YOU CAN'T SWIM? NOT A LICK. I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME. PASS. ALL THOSE STORIES ABOUT YOU BEING THE BACKSTROKE CHAMPION OF DARTMOUTH. BUTTERFLY. I FIGURE YOU'RE THE BEST MAN FOR THE JOB. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO SWIM FOR? YOU ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DRINK. DRINKING'S A LOT MORE FUN. YOU CAN'T DROWN. BEN, YOU KNOW I'M A CAMPER. A BACKPACKER. MM-HMM. I'VE BEEN DATING THIS LADY, REBECCA. AND I PROMISED TO... TO TAKE HER RIVER RAFTING ON THE WHITE RIVER. WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR? IT'S FOR HER BIRTHDAY. SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY? BUY HER A CAKE. I COULD REALLY USE YOUR HELP, BEN. BEALE, YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO UNDERSTAND SUBTEXT. I MEAN, WHAT I'M SAYING IS NO. BUT THE SUBTEXT IS, DROP DEAD, DROWN. I'M TIRED. SURELY, WE CAN STRIKE SOME SORT OF BARGAIN THAT WOULD BE MUTUALLY ADVANTAGEOUS. NO BARGAINS.

AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS TO BECOME WHEN HE'S FINISHED STUDYING? A SURGEON, JUST LIKE HIS OLD DAD. AND SOMEDAY, IF YOU'RE LUCKY, MAYBE HE'LL OPERATE ON YOU, HUH? FATHERS AND SONS. WELL, YOU REALLY DO LOOK HALF-WELL, MR. BROADWATER. I'LL BE BACK TOMORROW. MRS. BROADWATER. YOUR DAD'S GONNA BE JUST FINE. I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD'VE SAVED HIS LIFE. EXCUSE ME. DR. CRAIG? UH-HUH. YOU KNOW THAT QUESTION, THE ONE YOU ASKED ME IN SURGERY? YEAH. WELL, I, UH... I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE I, UH... YEAH? WELL, I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE NOW WOULD BE A GOOD... TODAY, EHRLICH. TODAY. OKAY. THE RIGHT ORIGINATES IN RIGHT AORTIC SINUS, RUNS TO THE RIGHT BENEATH RIGHT AURICLE TO CORONARY SULCUS. POSTERIOR DESCENDING BRANCHES... DOWN TO THE POSTERIOR INTERVENTRICULAR SULCUS TO APEX. THE MARGINAL BRANCH FOLLOWS RIGHT MARGIN TO APEX... EXCELLENT, EHRLICH. EXCELLENT. THANK YOU. SON, IS THERE ANYTHING YOU NEED THAT WE CAN GET FOR YOU? MONEY. I NEED IT TO BUY OFF THE ORDERLIES AND THE PRACTICAL NURSES. - IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT GETS THEM MOVING. - YOU WANT TO BRIBE THEM? NOW, LOIS. IT'S NOT BRIBERY, MOTHER. IT'S CALLED TIPPING. HOW MUCH DO YOU NEED, SON? WELL, THE BIGGER THE TIP, THE BETTER THE SERVICE. A COUPLE HUNDRED. HERE. WE TALKED TO THAT LAWYER, THAT MR. RAVELING. AND HE SAID THAT THINGS AREN'T AS BAD AS THEY LOOK. - NO? - NO. HE SAID THERE ARE BASICALLY TWO WAYS TO GO. SINCE IT'S YOUR FIRST FELONY CHARGE, AND YOU DIDN'T INTEND TO HURT ANYONE... NO ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THERE WHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF. WHAT'S THE SECOND OPTION? WELL, IT'S, UM, TEMPORARY INSANITY. MR. RAVELING SEEMS TO THINK HE KNOWS SOME PSYCHIATRISTS WHO WILL BE SYMPATHETIC. YOU TELL THAT OLD BASTARD WE WANT TO SEE SOME RESULTS, RIGHT? 'CAUSE IF HE CAN'T DO THE JOB, WE'LL GET SOMEONE BETTER. I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA LET THOSE PIGS HANG ME OUT TO DRY, ARE YOU? SON, WE'RE... WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. YOU KNOW THAT. I KNOW YOU WILL, DAD. YOU'VE NEVER LET ME DOWN BEFORE. UH-HUH? DR. WESTPHALL, CAN WE TALK? I WAS JUST LEAVING. OKAY. SORRY. JACK. MY KIDS WON'T LET ME TUCK THEM INTO BED ANYMORE ANYWAY. WHAT'S UP? I SAW MR. McALLISTER OUTSIDE HIS WIFE'S ROOM. BOY, WHAT A SHAME. IS SHE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT? EVERYBODY KEEPS ASKING ME THAT, AND I KEEP SAYING THE SAME THING... I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, IT'S IRONIC, ISN'T IT? REINHARDT SETS OFF A BOMB. KILLS TWO PEOPLE, MAYBE A THIRD, AND HE'S GONNA BE OKAY. AND WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE HE'S GONNA BE OKAY. AND THE ONLY THING HE FEELS FOR YOU OR ME OR McALLISTER OR HIS PARENTS... OR... ANYBODY... IS CONTEMPT. THIS OBNOXIOUS, WITHERING SARCASM. AND WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE HIM OKAY. WE CAN'T CHOOSE OUR PATIENTS. WHEN I GOT OUT OF COLLEGE, MY FOLKS WANTED ME TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL, BUT MY WIFE AND I HAD OTHER PLANS. WE BOUGHT A VAN AND TRAVELED AROUND THE COUNTRY FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. WE SAID WE WANTED TO EXPERIENCE THINGS, BUT THE TRUTH IS I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL. AND THE REASON I DIDN'T WANT TO GO WAS BECAUSE I KNEW... I DIDN'T WANT TO DEFEND SOMEONE WHO'S GUILTY. NOW, I UNDERSTAND WHY LAWYERS HAVE TO DEFEND GUILTY PEOPLE... AND WHY DOCTORS HAVE TO TREAT TERRIBLE HUMAN BEINGS. BUT I'VE GOTTA TELL YOU SOMETHING. THE REASONS AREN'T GOOD ENOUGH. BECAUSE IN ORDER FOR ME TO BE A GOOD DOCTOR, I'VE GOTTA SEPARATE MY FEELINGS FROM MYSELF. AND THAT SCARES THE HELL OUT OF ME. BECAUSE IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT I FEEL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE IN OR WHO I AM. YOU KNOW, UH, WHEN I FIRST STARTED MY INTERNSHIP, I WAS A VERY HAPPILY MARRIED MAN, BUT I FELL IN LOVE WITH ONE OF MY PATIENTS. SHE DIDN'T KNOW IT. I DON'T THINK SHE KNEW IT. MAYBE SHE DID. I DON'T KNOW. BUT I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. I SUFFERED. I USED TO CARRY HER X-RAYS AROUND WITH ME. THAT'S TRUE. OH, I DON'T KNOW. SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, DOCTORS STARTING OUT CARE TOO MUCH. AND THEN THEY GET OLDER, THEY DON'T SEEM TO CARE ENOUGH AND... THEY SEEM TO BECOME INURED TO THEIR OWN FEELINGS OR TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PAIN. IT'S A... I'M GONNA GO HOME. YOU KNOW SOMETHIN'? I THINK YOU WOULD'VE MADE A DAMN FINE LAWYER. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. HALF DAY, DR. WESTPHALL? OH, GOD.
