 Tell me about it while you put it out. - Maybe I put you out. - Pardon me? - [Speaks russian] - Hey! [Tires screech] That's right. You see? Now put it out! I'm not in the mood! Thank you. Oh, and, sweetheart, I'm not a whore, or that second thing you called me. I don't know what it is, but I know it's bad. Hey, you know what, maybe try one of those patches today. I don't think the gum's getting the whole job done. I'm sorry. I love you, all right? - I love you. - I'll speak to you later. Move! Sync and corrections by GeirDM for www.addic7ed.com [sirens] What about instead of getting another gun, you try enjoying the ones you got. Good morning, heathens. Hey, skip. - Hey. Thanks. - Hey, skip. - So what floor's this thing on? - All the way up, skip. She fought hard, huh? - Hard like Manny Pacquio. - I'd fight hard too. Far as she knew, the kids were next. Yeah, you're right. And the kids were where? Closet. You're kidding me. The kids were... Whole time. Yeah, that's gonna be fun. You all right there, buddy? Don't forget the ceiling, huh? [Whispering] I gotta take such a dump. Ooh... - Family friend, he found her. - Uh-huh. - Curtis hall. - Hull. - Hall. - Like Bobby hull. - Hall. - Right. So we got him out there, and the kids are upstairs in their room with the nanny. Can I get an ETA on the husband, Lou? How come the nanny wasn't with the kids this morning? How come the kids are with their mom when she's getting killed? - Dentist. - Huh. Lucky girl. Well, not if she got, like, a root canal, you know? Well, right. Murder and root canal is a push. Call the husband again, Lou. I want him here right now. Nobody go in there for 40 days and 40 nights. You gotta be kidding me right now. Here's the story. Hull says that he and the husband have been friends since medical school. Hull also says that he and the husband are supposed to be playing raquetball at 8:00 a.m. Except, 7:30 a.m., he's over at Lenox Hill in scrubs. He's like some kind of surgeon. Maybe "raquetball" is code for nailing your wife while you're at work. Maybe, baby. Thoracic. He's a thoracic surgeon. What is that? Is that like dinosaurs or something? Hey, gentlemen? You're kidding me here, right? You got a case? Are you kidding me? You're gonna do this again? Listen to me. My name was on top of the board going out of here last night. So do you want to explain to me how it is that you have a case and I don't? Well, you see, Jane, when a bad man does a murder, and someone calls the police, you see, the responding officer then will call his sergeant. And then that sergeant will then call... A homicide detective. And I'm sorry, but that homicide detective was not you. It's true. Morning. Can I talk to you? Yeah. Sure. Skip, it's on this time. It's on. Who's got two thumbs, was the Brooklyn college intramural ping-pong champion, and also could give a rat's ass? Wait, hold on. We gotta call Rosie. How old is she? - Four years old. - Four years old. [Speaker phone] Hi, daddy. Hey, Happy Birthday, Rosie. Both: Happy Birthday, Rosie! Who's my girl? If I kept blowing off the catching order and grabbing someone's cases, what would happen? Anything? What are you asking me for, Jane? I'm not taking the case away from those guys now. They got momentum. I don't mess with that. Is what you said the first time. I'll make it right, okay? You just gotta be patient. We gotta show them that you can hang. Is what you said the second time. [Police radio chatter] All: ♪ she looked so sweet from her two white feet ♪ All right, next one down the pike is yours, Jane. All right? So let's go get a snack already. I ate. You know, there's plenty of people in this squad could use some help if you want to do case work. It's not just about who gets to wear the whitest hat all the time. I never said it was. [Guys still singing] Hey! What are you doing out here? Knock it off. [Door shuts] All: ♪ she's the star of the county down ♪ - Happy Birthday. - We love you, Rosie. - I love you, daddy. - We do love you. Love you, baby. - Hey, need a hand? - Somebody saying I do? Not you specifically, no. All right. Meet Russell Moss. Russell Moss... Him and his girl go to the top of a building on 152nd, right? - Uh-huh. - Long story short, he throws the girl off the roof. Or so is my surmise since Russell's pretending he's deaf. So what do you want to do? We go in together? You want me to take a shot alone? What's your feeling? No, no. Actually, I need someone to go out to Brooklyn to pick up his stuff. If you could. Russell been keeping up with his parole officer? Never had one as far as I know. A lot of people say they never had one, but they do. Look at this, it's all prison-issued stuff. Dannemora...They give out these gray sweatshirts. He lets Robert keep his stuff in there too. Who's Robert? Robert...Brother? Cousin? Yeah, they cousins. Does he stay here with him? Is he here? - Mm-mm. Look, I have Russell. Now I need Robert. Give me a call if you see him, all right? Might not even be me here, so... I... I understand. You're busy. You're a busy man. I get it. It's a lot of work or one guy. Hey, you know what... Sir, would you be willing to be deputized? Are you up for that? - Uh... - For your country? Who... who gonna do that, you? What do we do? You have to take and oath. Uh, I don't know. Maybe. Yeah. Mr. Moresco, can you please stand? Put your hand on the emblem, please. Right between the pilgrim and the Indian. All right. Repeat after me, sir. [Clears throat] I... I... Raymond Moresco... Raymond Moresco... - Do solemnly swear... - Do solemnly swear... To uphold the laws and constitution... To uphold the laws and constitution... Of this great state of New York. Of this great state of New York. So help me God. You are hereby deputized from this moment onward by detective Jane Timoney of the NYPD. Welcome to the fight, Mr. Moresco. Robert Moss comes back here, call me. Okay. - 38-year-old Courtney Edgecourt was raped and murdered this morning in her home. No arrest has been made, but sources say a family friend is being questioned in connection with the case. Here's tom with a Metro update. All right, first up, we got a pattern of rapes on the east side, which Kachenko, from SVU here, is gonna tell us about. Yeah, okay, starting at 87th and Lex, continuing here, here, and so forth. These are all push-in type attacks. And this guy's a real freak. I mean, he does it all. After the sex, we're talking multiple stab wounds to the legs, buttocks, genitals. At least 20 per Vic. He's not a happy camper, hmm? Hey, uh... Look at this. You probably already noticed, but, uh, your rapes are clustered near the Townhouse murder, huh? What's your take on that? My thinking is all ours are 20s, single. All rental apartments. No kids, no money. Besides, I thought you had the guy... the husband's friend. What's his name, Curtis Hull? - Okay, but I mean, how many push-in maniacs are there working in the same 20-block radius, really? At least two, it looks like. Gents. This Townhouse murder case is really something else, right, skip? Reg, my son, I am crazy about this case. To quote the poet, I like this case like Patton liked war. It's a press case for sure. A kind of case like this is where the grade is made. Scusi. A case like this... You gotta deserve. I don't know, some people don't seem to think so. You know, I heard that too. Yeah, well, what would you tell those people, skip, assuming they could hear you? I'd tell 'em a story. The story of the beef trust. A squad is only as good as its beef trust. - True. - True. Because the beef trust only cares about the work. Knock on doors, follow leads, hear the words on the street. They don't bang bureau chiefs to transfer out of midtown. Subtle, Reg. Very subtle. Yet relevant. You know, let us commemorate our fellowship with the adding of liquor to ice. There it is. [Laughter] - That's a good idea. - Good idea. That's an even better idea. [Door shuts] It has nothing to do with our being divorced, Matt. I would never let our son stay in a home where the tv wasn't mounted no matter whose it was. Okay, so fine. I mean, we were thinking about mounting the tv anyway, so... Also the instant boiling water thing on the kitchen sink... So something designed for a world without six-year-old boys. I guess we can ask the super to disable it. I mean, I know you use it, but... Oh, no, that's okay. Is it gonna be hard for you to not use your phone around Owen, Jane, with your job and everything? We really try to not use our phone around him. I'm sure Matt's told you. - Uh-huh. Um, so if we take care of the tv and the instant-hot, then Owen can start spending the night here, yeah? Yeah, that is the idea. Oh... I can't believe that I almost forgot. I know that uniformed policemen carry their guns, but I wasn't sure if that that meant that you do. - It does. - I wasn't sure. But so where is your gun? Well, there's only her duty weapon. The detectives used to have to keep them on them all the time, but not since when, like, the 80s? So now when she goes off shift, she just locks it in her desk at work. I mean, that'll do, right? Why wouldn't it do, Matthew? Come here. I want to show you something. Owen's not getting into this. Matt pretty much can't get into it. But if you still feel uncomfortable, that's fine. I'll deal with it however you want. But you needed to know because...This is here. Why? I mean, I don't ev... why? Hey, come here for a minute. No, no, no, no. Don't even talk to me right now. There's no way that he's gonna get into that thing. So they didn't see Hull. The mom locked 'em in the closet first. They also didn't not see him. If this is Hull, and he's been throwing a hump into Mrs. Edgecourt for however long, then why rape? 'Cause the autopsy says it is. Oh. I'll tell you what. This Hull is coming across as pretty credible so far. Look, I gotta choose between a guy with blood all over him or a player to be named later, I'm going with the blood. What crawled up your ass and died? Jane did. Yeah. On account of you guys taking her cases and leaving me to clean up your mess. Thanks a lot for that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, very funny. Yeah. And I got news for you two dummies. She's a good detective. She's good at something, all right. This about her and Costello? Huh? Obviously you two guys only care about the two of them having been an item or whatever. But Jane got the transfer off how she handled the murder in the park... off closing a good case. Costello didn't get it for her. He didn't ask about it. He never came into it. Hand to God. Listen, I'm not a stooge. Aw, come on, Kevy. We know that. You're a survivor. And she's an empty suit. It's great to see you. It's feeling like old times up in here. Listen, in need the OCC report on the Madison Avenue rapist, and the names and addresses of all the victims because I'm gonna talk to them myself. Okay, then you're saying something, and I hear you. Yeah. I think the Townhouse killer and the Madison Avenue rapist are the same guy. - What does SVU think? - They don't. So they won't show you the report. I didn't ask. Because you thought old Evrard'll let you mosey up in here and read the chief of d's copies? - Uh-huh. Oh, this is an outrage. Where's my apple fritter? Women DTs lurk and wait to blow up the careers of good cops. I mean, you scratch your batteries, and it's a hostile work environment. [Laughter] We've seen that happen, right? No, look, Danny Costello aside... - Yeah? - I am telling you, that is who your Janie is. She's one of us till it suits her not to be, and eventually, it always does. Let me tell you something... ow! What was that? "Oh! Ow!" Aah! - Jay. - Jay! Jay! - Jay. - Jay, what are you doing? Jay. Jay. - Hey! - Call an ambulance. Hey, get us a bus! Get us a bus! Augie! Stay with us. Jay! - Augie! - Jay, stay with us. Jay! They were prepping him for surgery, but he didn't... he died. I know it's hard to talk about it right now, sir. Then why are we? Because letting the ball drop on the Townhouse murders seems like the only thing that could make a bad thing worse. A case that was yours to begin with, right? I'm not denying that's a part of it, all right? He was sitting in the chair you're sitting in last night. Your colleague, with one of the highest closure rates in department history. My friend, whose baby girl turned four yesterday! What kind of a woman... what kind of a person are you that you come in here like this today and ask for that man's job? I haven't decided anything. When I do, I'll let you know. Get out. [Glass rolls on floor] Dad? Dad? - Yeah? - Hey. Ah, that's all of 'em, all right. If you don't have enough room, I can just... I do. Of course. Of course. Mother of God, what flavor is that? A minty watermelon thing. Do me a favor and stick with cinnamon, please. Don't get fancy on me. The cinnamon has my tongue burnt off. Well, it's better than a sharp stick in the eye. How's the detective that had the heart attack... Kearney? Keating. Dead. Oh, jeez. Kids? - I told you. A boy, a four-year-old girl. Well, we'll do a whip-around down at the bar. Should be good for a few hundred. Yeah. I asked for his job this morning. And? And I made an enemy out of my boss for life, pretty much. What's your source of information on that? Is it you? I just thought I gotta ask now, while they're distracted, before they can regroup. Right? I thought that was my only chance, but maybe it wasn't. Maybe I should have waited. Maybe I shouldn't have asked at all. Or maybe I should have called Dan Costello and asked him for the job because that's what they all think I do anyway! No, you're just uncomfortable because you didn't get an answer, Janie, not because you're instincts were bad. Remember Curtis Mayfield? It might not come when you want it, but when it does... It'll be right on time! The Townhouse case, the task force... I'm giving it to her. Here, have another pop. [Ice rattles in glass] I'm sorry. Now who's an empty suit, Kevin? [Door opens, shuts] Let's go down and have a pint or four, and talk about how much we miss smoking. The point is, we thought you had cancer, that you were dying. Remember? All I am saying is what if your Dr. Geller trots out the same X-ray with the shadowy mass for all of his patients that have a bad habit? Dad, stop looking for excuses to smoke. All right? You asked me to quit. I quit. I don't want to quit. Do I look like I want to quit? But I'm doing it for you. I'm not gonna do it alone. Do not flake on me. I'm not kidding you, I will frame you for something. Get it? [Cell phone rings] Timoney. Okay. Great. Thank you, sir. Yeah. Thanks. No. [Chuckles] According to the NYPD, since the brutal murder of Courtney Edgecourt in her upper east-side home, handgun carry licence applications have gone up by 600%. Mrs. Edgecourt was raped and killed in front of her two children. As yet, no arrest has been made. He was a good detective, a husband, and a father, and I'm very sorry for everyone's loss. I think we can all agree that the best way to honor his memory is to work this case till it goes down. Yeah? That being said, detective Duffy, can you please tell us where we're at right now? Autopsy showed semen and rape. We're waiting for the DNA to tell us whose semen. But you think it's Curtis Hull's, yeah? You want to dive in? I assume you do want to dive in. I do want to, yes. Hello there, Mr. hull. Is the DNA back yet? Takes a little time, I'm afraid. Longer than it takes on tv. Anyway, I just wanted to ask you about your rap sheet. The charges of soliciting prostitution. Not here. As you wish. I didn't try to hide that, okay? The other two detectives asked me about them too. Read their notes. I did. I was just wondering why you didn't mention that the prostitutes were men. I used to be in vice, Mr. Hull. Those other detectives did not. So maybe they're not as good as I am at knowing which kind of hookers stroll where. 51st and 2nd Avenue. Cadman Plaza near the courts in Brooklyn... I know where I was. It just might have been a thing to mention to the other detectives since they didn't pick up on it themselves. It might have helped them to see that you would never rape a woman. They didn't want help. And I'm not hurting my family any more than I already have. Not to prove something that the DNA will prove for me. Those kids are my godchildren. Did you know that? And now, because of you people, they think I'm the one who did it. You know what... Don't come here again. I won't. [Beep] I mean, are we gonna look the place over? What are we doing? You were here the first time that Keating talked to the kids? Yeah. So it was you, Keating, the kids, but no child psychologist, huh? There was no psych report in the file. Did he even call one? No. Did you? No. Right? So whatever they've told you will be open to calling "coerced." It didn't matter, okay? [Knocks on door] They said they don't know anything. They said they never saw the guy. And you were satisfied with that? - I was. - Yeah. Yeah, I know. It doesn't matter, okay. They said they didn't... - yes? - Hi there. Detective Jane Timoney. I'm the new detective on the case. Hold, please. You call this guy. His name is Dr. Kevin Hynes. He's great with kids. He's great in court. He's waiting for your call. Tell him to meet us down here now. Pardon me. I was just in the closet upstairs, and I noticed that the carpet was worn down right in front, and the door didn't touch the floor, so you can see right under there. You can see a lot. Caleb, I think you looked. I would have looked. I'm pretty sure you did. Hey, this one's a 12-gauge. I have one just like it. A Remington 870 Wingmaster. Very cool. I used to have this one called a Mossberg, but it gave me problems. And the Remington racks louder than the Mossberg. You now what "rack" is? Huh? This thing. [Imitated shotgun pump] You don't have those. Those what? The guns? Sure I do. See that? It's like that one. Huh? You can touch it if you want. Why are you drawing pictures of guns, Caleb? You don't want to say? You afraid you're gonna get in trouble? Is that what it is? Let me guess, you're drawing them because you're thinking about using them. Huh? Everybody here, they want to protect you from this awful thing. But you don't want to be protected. You're angry, and you want to be angry. And you're not gonna get in trouble for that. Not with me. So tell me about the man that you saw. I would kill him with this. I would help you. Listen, we were wrong. Okay? You found an angle, worked the kid. Good job. Let's go good job. Could I ask you something? You ever worry that someone might drop a house on you? Car's not gonna drive itself, is it? I guess you don't. All right. - Let me call you back. - Hey, boss, you're gonna want to hear this. I talked to the edgecourt kids. The appeal-proof way this time. They described the man who murdered their mother as a young male, dark hair, with a slight accent, and as not being Curtis Hull. As of now, Curtis Hull is off the table. As of now, our prime suspect is a guy we haven't met. A guy who lives in the neighborhood or works in the neighborhood or both. A guy who was part of the scenery until suddenly he's not. Okay? So, gentlemen, we're going back to square one, starting over till we find him. So everybody get on board right now because this is happening. I just want a couple of your rape victims to look at our sketch. What's the problem? We handed over what we have. We cried and we hugged and we shared with you. But we're not getting our vics all confused by showing 'em your eight-year-old's fingerpainting. So what happens when the DNA comes back and shows it's all the same guy? Maybe it will and maybe it won't. Till then it's every squad for themself. All I know is after months of 'round the clock on some seriously brutal, brutal rapes, forgive me if I don't want to wake up and see homicide get credit when the headlines say "east side killer nabbed," huh? Heh heh, you gonna get killed tonight, buddy. See, I've got 500 on Perez knocking you down in the first round. - Is that right? - Yeah. Do you got me knocking you down in the parking lot after? [Laughter] 'Cause that might be a good bet. All right, listen up, guys. Remember, tonight's smoker is now a benefit to help Jay's wife and kids cover their expenses. So if I don't see you there, don't bother coming in to work tomorrow. Right? You better kill Perez tonight. I mean, you kill him! Okay? We're gonna be your alibi. Good. I'm gonna need an alibi. Good luck tonight. You too. Thanks. ♪ ♪ - Come on, pay up. - I don't have any money. In the interest of working every available angle on the case, that task force will be led by detective Jane timoney, so at this time I'll turn everything over to her. - Can you talk into the mics? - Yes. [Crowd roaring] The suspect has been identified as a male hispanic, 5'9", slim build and young, slight accent, and carries a folding knife. If you saw something or you know something, please call crimestoppers at 1-800... does this mean Curtis Hull is out of the picture? Yes, it does. [Crowd roaring] [Cheering] Stay down! [Bell rings] [Crowd clamoring] [Whistles] [Clapping] Hola. How'd it go? Oh, okay. How 'bout I buy you guys a round? Please. Oh, detective timoney! You say the nicest things. - Where's Reg? - He's upstairs. [Tv announcer reporting on race] Champ coming in, champ coming in! Playin' a champ. You been here this whole time? Did you even watch? I watched. I would like to buy the champ a drink, please. Don't you take her money, Ballard. Tell that bitch it's no good in here. - Hey, yo. Hey, yo. Hey, hey. - You want drinks? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - I'll buy drinks. - Are you kidding me? She wants to work homicide, let her go back to midtown. Or you could wave your ass at the commissioner this time. Maybe you'll get a transfer to Scotland yard. Acting like it's coming to you. Walking all over the memory of a great man. Jay Keating's heart exploding was the best thing that ever happened to you, and we all know it. So stop expecting his guys to give you respect. ♪ ♪ Skip. ♪ ♪ Hey. Matty? Yeah? I know you're still mad at me, and you can be mad at me again tomorrow, but can you talk to me for a minute, please? [Sobbing] [Phone ringing] [Beep] Timoney. Detective? - Uh-huh. Am I still your deputy? Oh. You're in for life, Mr. Moresco. What... what's going on? They had you on the tv, um, with the press conference, uh, uh, with the drawing? Yeah, yeah. Did... did you recognize it? No, not me. One of the guys here says he thinks he dated your guy's mom. Wow, okay. Can you keep him there? Yeah. Are you kidding? I got the guy a pizza. I get money back for that? From the mayor himself. I'm bringing it to you right now.

[Spits] Detectives said in addition to Courtney Edgecourt's murder, Ayala is being charged with eight counts of rape in the first degree in connection with a string of attacks on the Eastside this past year. Up next, traffic and weather at five minutes past the hour. I miss him. Hey, Reg. Buy you a free coffee? Terrible day, huh? Yeah. They're always pretty terrible, though. How many of these do you think you've been to? Some days, it feels like all of them. You? Too many to count. After 9/11? I had three funerals the one day. Plus, a tree branch fell on my mom's house. I had to get up on the roof in my dress blues 'cause I didn't have any time to change. It ever make you think about quitting? Nothing ever makes me think about quitting. What, you? I'll always want to be a cop. Always. This squad, it's my home. And you're invading it. I know you miss your friend. Maybe try to figure out how much of this has to do with that. You know what? By the time you're done, I bet you'll end up thinking I'm your favorite. 'Cause at least I'm honest. Yeah? So am I. You need a new home. Like fun I do. But if I did, you're not the man who's gonna give it to me. Skip. Don't forget to put some money in the tip. So your father just took 'em all? He have a gun safe too? He actually bought me mine. But so the list is done. The super disabled the insta-hot today. Did he lock the garbage chute too? No, I already told you, it's at the end of the hall. - Other tenants use that too. Not just us. - Oh, well, then so wait to talk to him after Owen goes down it headfirst. Know what? I'm gonna hit the restroom. Yep. If the waiter comes, get me a Bourbon. What kind? The kind with alcohol. What happened to your arm and your... your face? Good day at work. What about those bodies on the beach in Long Island? It's a big deal, right? Yeah. I'll bet you wish you were working on that. Hmm, not so much. I'm good for now. How about we talk about your burglary charge instead? Want to? I mean, there is a certain school of thought that says an engagement gets broken up, the girl should give back the ring with you there. That doesn't mean you get to break into her place and take it back. Plus, apparently an engagement camera and what, an engagement shearling coat? - All right. I, um, I-I see what this is.
