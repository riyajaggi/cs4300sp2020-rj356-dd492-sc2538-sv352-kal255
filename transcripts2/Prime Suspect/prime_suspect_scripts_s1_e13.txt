 Hey. Mind the glass, people. Where isn't there glass, Augie? There's, like, 50 9-millimeter casings on the ground. So most likely two guys shooting a Mac-10 each, or one guy shooting two at the same time. How's the owner doing? Where is he? Mr. Nasiri took a couple chunks of shrapnel but E.M.S. patched him up. I wouldn't say he's too thrilled. If somebody with a machine gun was mad at me I wouldn't be too thrilled either.

 Yeah, you know what, I might feel bad for myself too. But then I would look at this poor dead guy lying on the ground, and then I'd go, "Wow. You know, things could be a lot, lot worse." True, but then I'd probably remember how my store got all shot to hell, and get mad. How I'm going to be on hold with the insurance company. - Right. - It's a nightmare. So jaded, the both of you. It's actually sad. You see, life is a precious, precious gift. This coming from a guy who announced in the break room today that if we were out of non-dairy creamer he was going to kill himself?

 Okay. So there you were behind the counter and the victim was facing you. Is that right? Yes, and I'm telling him that I don't have the box in the cigarettes he wants, only soft pack. Then I see a blue car go by. Then I hear something. Then I hear the window is cracking. - Then it crashes in. - Uh-huh, you saw the bullets coming out of the blue car? I saw it! Little fireballs! Especially before the window crashed in! Hey! Hey! I hit the two! I hit the two! Get back there. Especially when the window crashed in. And I saw it before I got down. You had an argument with anyone recently? A customer or employee? - Get back, sir, get back. - I don't have trouble, I don't make trouble. There is no reason. Well, listen maybe somebody thinks you're cutting in - on their business. - You know that! Maybe somebody's trying to send you a message, like our friend over here. You see something happen here? - All right? - Hey. Was it the middle digit... The two... my friend? Yes. The four and the one I didn't hit. But the two, right on. Good for you. Sounds like you won some money. He's a little busy right now, but Detective Blando's going to talk to you, all right? Hold it, hold it. It's all right. Interesting. Hmm. You taking some action in your store, huh? You running some numbers? I don't know what that is. Well, it's illegal... That's one thing it is. You stiff somebody over a number, or somebody think you did? To be honest, Mr. Nasiri, that sounds like a much better reason than the one you gave, which is no reason. You got security cameras in your store? How 'bout you show them to me, huh? Detective Duffy. Ms. Carey? Nice to see you. I'm using up all my time off of work with this thing. - It's hard for me. - I know. - It's hard to get here too. - I know, I'm sorry. If we don't do this part, the rest of it don't mean anything. And this guy Cordero... he's got to go to jail. Ms. Davila. Glad you could make it. Yeah, I don't know how glad I am, but I'm here. So today they might call witnesses? They need you here in case. But they might not. - Detective Reg Duffy. - Yes. Okay. All right, listen. You guys, uh, just hang here. Did you see Marcus yet? Mr. Ramirez... the other witness? Have you guys seen him around yet? I thought I saw him coming through security behind me, but I guess that wasn't him. Uh, too bad, 'cause, you know what? I wanted to sit down with him and have a good chin-wag about baseball. Our team needs investors. Let's go Mets, baby. Hi. Raise your right hand. You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. How many color variations of car paint do people need to have? There should be blue cars, silver cars, maybe red cars, and shut up. All right, take it easy. Was the car in the security video at all? - Looking for a dark blue, two-door car. Plate ends with a "B." Hello, that's practically a signed confession. We've closed cases on way less than that, - admit it. - I know, I know. I'm just cranky today. - Who wants a triple-Decker pastrami sandwich? - I'm buying. - What's the occasion? There have to be an occasion? - No, but yes. - Had a good morning in court. Now are we going out? Or are we ordering in? - Out. - I should stay here. I've got older black guy shot in a bodega drive-by... 130th and Lenox. - Victim a neighborhood guy? - The owner didn't know him, but he said he'd seen him around. - Older? How old? - 65 about... - 70? - Whoa, whoa, whoa... What's his name? His name? What? What? Ramirez. Marcus Ramirez. He... he was one of my witnesses for the Cordero case. Man. Just a great guy. Pre-trial hearing today. He wasn't there. Guess now I know why. ♪ ♪ Prime Suspect Season 01 Episode 13 Stuck In The Middle With You Original Air Date January 22, 2012 ♪ Yeah oh ♪ ♪ Yeah oh ♪ ==sync, correction by dcdah== www.addic7ed.com ♪ Yeah oh ♪ ♪ Yeah oh ♪ It ain't a coincidence. Ramirez was solid. Cordero knew it. Cordero wanted him gone. - And now he is. - Okay, you know what? Putting my case and how I don't want it torpedoed aside, - for the moment... - Your case? Our case, Stevie. Not to mention it was my case first. Fine, our case, Reg. Damn it! Even a rumor about witnesses in criminal cases being executed is enough for my boss to want to mobilize on this. Right, but we got a tough enough time getting people to testify as it is. And don't forget, the other two witnesses need protecting too, of this theory... Ms. Carey and Ms. Davila. The D.A.'s office is going to fund us, okay? We'll get them put up in a hotel, get a uniform detail for them... The whole nine yards. And plus, whatever you need from here, - you got. - We need ideas about how to connect this to Cordero is what we need. Maybe we put someone in there with him. Do we know anyone from the criminal elements, since time is not on our side? I know someone. - Yes? - Teddy Melendez. He's doing 8 1/3 to 25 in Elmira, he's stone cold. Melendez killed that pimp... what... seven years ago? Yeah, the Vic was trying to pimp out Teddy's little sister... He's a family guy, after all. What's our angle with him? Our angle is he has a girlfriend and kids that he's having trouble taking care of from inside. He's up for parole in a couple years anyway, so we should just give it a try. All right, fine. Let's give it a try. 'Cause if it doesn't fly, we're gonna have to try something else. Before our case goes down the tubes, Stevie. You want to keep that finger? Also, are onions all you eat? Hey, hey! Frick and frack! Sit down, both of youse. So the thing with the pimp and your sister, that was your only arrest, right, Teddy? And you did a lot of time for that, relatively, and never asked for anything. Say what you want. All right, we got a guy... a drug dealer... Who's looking at life for murder. He's trying to have all the witnesses killed. He's got one already... Somebody's grandpa. So we transfer you down to Rikers, put it out that there's new charges. Yeah? What'd I do this time? Uh, stuck up a dice game. Gut-shot a guy... felony murder. You talk to Cordero. Find out the plan, who he's got doing it... And we recommend you for work release and early parole. - Santana Cordero, huh? - Yeah. Or maybe you thought I don't know who he is? Just get next to him and tell you all the haps, that's all. - Mm-hmm. What are you smoking? Hmm? Hey... Let me ask you something, Teddy. Okay? How many conjugal visits you get a year here? Wow. One a month, man. Just enough to make it really hurt. What if it was two a month? Would you be talking then? Four. - 2 1/2. - A half? - Yeah. - What the hell even is that? Enough for some things, not enough for others... I don't know. What do you say? Oh, ho! No, no, no, no, no! Oh, my God. Guys! You got to come see this right now. What? Right here, right here. Warden's office, right? Sends me a link from the security cameras over at Rikers, right? - Your boy, okay? - Teddy. Yes. First day he gets transferred over to Rikers, fresh meat, new day, - and here we go. - Santana. - Uh-huh. - There he is. Teddy, right? And... These lucky bastards. Oh, now they're talking trash. Yeah. Okay, but this guy, he starts laughing. He's laughing right now. Okay, our guy, he then goes into character. Here he goes! Oh! The urge to stage a fight is strong in this one. Ev, you're going to want to see... Curtain up, let the play begin. - Here we go. - Oh! - Uh-oh. - This... this right here. Right here. Look. Look. Oh! Yes. Nice one. - Ouch. - This is commitment! - This is... - This is the Brando of snitches. Teddy! I would like your aces, please. Well, you can't have them. Tell him, Owen. You have to ask the person on your left. Simmer down, buddy, he can hear you. The person on my left? You're the person on my left, right? - Yes. - I would like your aces then, - please, Master Webb. - Go fish. Oh. Dad, give me your sevens. What about a please? Please, can I have your sevens? Man. - I win! - Oh. Again? How do you keep doing that, mister? - ♪ Dah-dah-dah ♪ - Now it's your deal. - Hang on, bud. People might need a bathroom break and a beer break. And a "more" break. Oh! Can you come back over Saturday night and play games again? Dad got me a World War II one. He says it's better with more people. D-day? Battle of the Bulge? European theater. - Oh-ho. Not only will I come over and play I also might not ever leave. Come here, bud. I love this. I know you do. Yeah, well, it helps me relax... Knowing that this is here. You going to be here on Saturday night? - Play the game with us? - Where else would I be? Ah. Go. Hurry, go, go. Uh, you know... Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. I'm not too good at this, uh, shuffling thing. Now is there anyone who can show me how it's done? Okay. You have to really watch. Watching's my best talent. You didn't give me a lot of time to make an impression on your boy Santana, you know? I just did what you said. And did you make an impression on him, you think? Yeah. He's over with his boys, being all loud, talking about his hearing he just had and some bitch named Diane. So I say, "Yo, I got people on the outside if you're looking to get something done." Uh-huh, and that bumped Santana, you going right at him like that? Nah, he was into it. So Santana goes, "Yeah." And I go, "I know a guy... "Used to put in work for the Luccheses. I can get you on the phone with him." Mm-hmm. And what did, uh... What did he say? He said what's my guy's number? It's issued by the D.A .'s office. Untraceable. They're bringing over a recorder for it today. And then he said he hopes my guy knows how to be low profile. 'Cause his boy who did the first witness made a big damn mess out of it. Hmm. - How's it going. - Really? - What? - What's the problem? The problem is Cordero was my case I busted my sack on, and now it's like I got to beg for crumbs of what's going on... That's the problem. - What the hell is this? - Who else could it be? It's Cordero. Hey look, the guy from the D.A. is not here yet. We can't set up a recording yet. No, no. It doesn't matter. Doesn't matter... We got to get it. You got to get it. Answer it. Hey! What are you doing? What? Answer it. Hey! Answer it. Speaker on. Shhh! Okay, wait. Yeah. This my man? Might be. Who is this? Teddy Melendez gave me your number. - Mm-hmm. Okay, you got a name? A lot of people want to talk to me, my man. Why don't you tell me why I should care about you, man? What do you got to say for yourself? - What you got on your resume? - Huh... Well, um... You remember that apartment up on 111th Street, - last year? - 111th, yeah. Some of Isaiah Walker's boys had a package up in there. Oh, yeah, they did. Till somebody went in there and shot them. Cut their throats too, I heard. Only two of them. - Mm-hmm. Always wondered who that was. So your boy tell you that I might have some work? 'Cause I got a couple people giving me grief, you know? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, uh-huh. So, uh, one of them's called Diane Carey. She's a teacher or whatever. School's on 109th. - Yep. - The other one's Lola Davila. Got a bunch of kids, sounds like. So she don't work. Couple of ladies, huh? That's what we talking about here? Yeah, why? You... You don't like that? I like everything, my man. Yeah. Sounds like you would've been good for this other thing I got going then. If it wasn't going to be done already. Wait, so you... So you got some other things going on besides this? Yeah. I got this thing with this cop. All right. So you gonna kill a cop, huh? You sure you want to do that, my man? He in the court blowing me a kiss... Whatever... Like I can't do nothing, except I can, poppa. I can take that ugly, bald, Irish mother out. Well, if you're going to do that, then, uh, hey, you should let me do that for you, dog. I've done cops before. I do it clean. No, no, no, no, no. You want the ladies, go ahead, I'll wait for you. My boy got the detective handled. You sure, my man? I can do that, now. You know what? I'll hit you back. You don't know that he's talking about me. Sign off on a uniform detail. Fixed post on his apartment, starting now, around the clock. Right, and we'll cover him from detective squad... Say, six-hour shifts. I can hear you. Can you hear me? - This is nuts. - Uh, fine. So go to the hotel, with the witnesses. You going to the hotel, with the witnesses? - No. - Well, then you have a fellow detective with you 24/7, 'cause it's one or the other. You guys don't really believe this boloney, do you? Cordero's going to whack me for making a kissy face? Did you believe Marcus Ramirez was going to get whacked, Reg? - But he was. - So how about this? Calderon, you want to go first? - Yeah. - Ev and I'll, uh, figure out the next few shifts, maybe do a sign-up sheet. We'll take our turns, but we're also trying to run down Cordero's known associates. Figure out who it is he meant when he said his "boys" were handling Duffy. I got two days off, starting in, like, three minutes. I do not want people following me around on my personal time. Not "people," it's Lou. Try to have some fun, Duffy. Pop some corn, rent some rom-coms. Great. Come on. I'll buy you an ice cream. Come on... Strawberry. Hey, Abe. How you doing, man? - You all right? - I guess, man. I don't know, Augie, man. Okay, why don't you just tell me what happened. Got a 911 call to an SRO hotel. Little girl's there unconscious. And that son of a bitch tries to tell me that she choked on a chicken bone. What did the E.R. say? Attending doctor said that her skull's fractured. She's got burns and all type of marks on her. And... You know what "and." I'm going to bury him. - I already know... - Okay, listen, listen. I am with you, Abe. You know it, okay? I'm with you in spirit. But first, I want to try to get this guy to bury himself with his own words, okay? - I don't. - I know you don't. But we're going to get you a cup of coffee... Come on... and we're going to talk about it. Come on. How about Blando next? You're out of control. Listen, are you hungry? Kitchen's over there. Help yourself... It's all fair game. Uh, especially if it's in the fridge and it's got "Calderon" written on it. What's going on, Augie? I thought you said that little girl was in a coma. She's not dead, is she? She's hanging on for the moment, thank God. But, in the meantime, I'm taking the, uh, opportunity to give our friend Officer Develle a lesson in how do things in detective squad. And how's that, Professor? Well, you see, when you got a pervert in custody, I could beat him until my arms are tired, which might make me feel good for the moment. Or I could sweat his confession, which will make me feel good for the rest of my life. - Sign-up sheet, Blando. Sign up for what? - What did I miss? - Nothing. Oh, except, uh, Santana Cordero put a hit out on Duffy, and we don't know who he hired for the job. But besides that, nothing. Uh, lieutenant, you ready, sir? - Yeah. - Hey, everybody, listen up, please. We're looking into Cordero's past arrests, - all of them. - Everybody who was arrested - with him, every time. - Everybody he called when he was arrested, every time. Who he was locked up with, who went and visited him when he was locked up, every time. So a name comes up more than once, flag it and give it to me and Ev. Okay, any questions? No? Good. Anything you want to add, lieutenant? Let's just remember, this is one of our own. Men who are diligent with their business will stand before kings. - All right? - You heard the man. Get diligent. Turns out I got no milk. And no sugar, so... Looks like, uh, a little... little collection you got here, huh? Museum. That your dad? - Yeah. - See it in the face. Oh, this is his shield, right here? Take your coffee, would you? I was trying to be nice. What squad was he in? The old 16th. 1961... they wore those big, wool overcoats. His "horse blanket," he used to call it. Reg. - Coffee's terrible. - You know what? Why don't I just put on the radio. Then we can sit and we don't even have to talk. Reggie. I got your laundry. And a casserole. The green beans are fresh, but, you know, the mushroom soup... Hi there. How are you. I didn't know you had a friend over. Yeah, he's not a friend. - He's... he's just... - Not a friend? - I'm a friend. - Lillian Duffy. - I'm this one's mother. - Luisito Calderon. - Give me a hug. - Oh. - Give me a hug. - Oh, my. - Spanish. - I'm Puerto Rican. Oh, you know, I think our super is Puerto Rican. He's Ukrainian, ma. What? No. Are you sure? Danny Eleniak? Uh, yeah. Well, I'm going to warm this up. Uh, you staying for dinner, Louis? - No. - I could. - Shut up. - Is the oven working? Because the oven was not working. It was the pilot light. I fixed it. Well, [Laughs] We may all get gassed to death, Lewis, but if we don't, I hope you're hungry. Yes, ma'am, I am. Rafael Alenzo and Kevin Garvey. Alenzo was in court for Duffy's little stunt at the pre-trial hearing, and in federal prison with Cordero, for drug trafficking from New York to Connecticut. And his cousin Garvey has a two-door blue Honda... Plate number 9-4-7-K-T-B. Otherwise known as the car that shot down Marcus Ramirez. Huh. Good job. "Good job." That's what I get? - Yep. - We just probably broke some kind of squad record for time on this. And I get no proverb? I want a proverb, damn it. "They that forsake the law praise the wicked... But such as keep the law contend with them." Chapter 28, verse 4. There's your proverb. That's weak. - That's what? - That's weak. "The wicked flee when no man pursueth... "But the righteous... are bold as a lion." How about that? You should have been a preacher. I know stuff. There's a coffee shop in the lobby. Go park yourself. I'll be a half hour, tops. You know, I'm sorry. Seriously, I mean, thanks for volunteering to watch me and everything, but you don't need to be right on top of me. - Yeah, no, I do. - It's not Times Square, it's a doctor's appointment. I hope the magazines aren't too old. I hate that. What? It's private. I got a dad and four brothers. I've had a boyfriend or ten. You think you're gonna shock me? You can't. You think I'm gonna tell someone? I'm not. Come on. It's either your genitals or your anus. Hey, Consumer Reports. Only four years old. Score. Hey. Hey, how's our boy? Looking cranky. Doctor's appointment is all. - The uncomfortable kind. - Say no more. Seriously, either of you. Martel's not here yet. Sit down, relax. Unless that's going to be uncomfortable. Mother of Mary, deliver me. So how you doing, Ev? All good. How 'bout you? Bad breakup. But I'm getting over it. I know that story. I just separated from my wife, so... Mmm. Must be in the air, huh? - Must be. - You okay? You know what? It ain't all bad. - Chop-chop, Reg. Lot of ground to cover. Isn't the guy who wasn't late supposed to say stuff like that, Stevie? What? You're not coming in with me? Why? Oh, I don't know. To guard my life? There are policemen all over this building, Reg. This is the only door in or out of here. You're fine. You know what? You all should try getting your protocols straight... When you let me leave your sight and when you don't. So we all know. You're welcome. Wow. What tour were you doing that day? The 8:00 to 4:00. And who were you working with? - Detective Jay Keating. - God rest his soul. Were you in the office when you got the call? Coming back from lunch. We heard the job over the air. Responded to the scene. Uniform was already there grabbing up everybody. Out of that, we got three eyewitnesses. Brought them back to the squad. Took their statements. Is this the statement from the witness Marcus Ramirez? - Yeah. - And, uh, is that the photo array that you showed Mr. Ramirez? - It's a menu. - Come on. Yeah, he picked him out straight away. Tell me what Mr. Ramirez told you. Without looking at it. He was getting his paper. He saw the suspect approach the victim... Who was standing with his young son. The suspect said, "I told you, bitch. I told you to move." He pulled a wrench out of his coat and beat the victim to the ground with it. A wrench? A fire-hydrant wrench. Mr. Ramirez was a fireman for 27 years. He recognized it. He'd never seen one used to kill someone before, - but he recognized it. - Objection. Overruled. Listen, I'm... I'm always down for a good restaurant, you know? I just don't seem to remember the last time we did anything like that. Right. No. No date nights? We always say we're going to try. But then the kids, you know, they usually... Act up and say they want to go. So we end up staying home. Or when we do make it out of the house one of us usually ends up saying, you know, - "Do you really like this place?" - "The kids"? - Right. - Right. Uh-huh. Alenzo's back. What's he got there, pizza? Probably beer? Well, let's hope they're in for the night, because the game is on. You going out with your man tonight? - No. - Huh. Why are we having a conversation about dates then? Because right now, I have to go babysit Duffy while he's on one. Can you take a picture of that? You know I will. One... you don't talk, to me or to her, unless it's "Get down, he's got a gun." - Two... you don't look at us. - I don't think I'll be doing that from out in the hallway, but okay. I can't see why we have to do this here. - You could have canceled. - I don't cancel. I can't believe you haven't offered me a drink. So what are you going to name the kids, do you think? Regis, Jr. if it's a boy, obviously. But if it's a girl, what? Regina, maybe? She's here. - Hey, there you are. - Hey. Oh, nice. Thanks. So, uh, so... Jane. - Becky. Hey. - Hey. She's not here. Um. Remember I told you they were putting a guard detail on me? Right, but I thought it meant uniforms. - I wish. - Me too. Well, she's going to be in the hall, but if you want to take a rain check - you know. - It doesn't matter now. - Let's do this. - All right. Oops. Don't want the tater tots to burn, - do we? - You know what? - Huh? - Why don't you go out in the hall and guard something. - Really? - Really? Are you kidding me? Just shut up. It's just dinner. - With him. - With a colleague. - Who is him. - Yeah, I know what you think, but... You do? You know what I think? Maybe it's because I'm from another squad or something? But he acts different with me than he does with you, okay? Why, what a ringing endorsement. This is getting weird. It's getting weird? Can we just pick this up another time? Oh, yeah. We're going to pick it up. We're going to pick it up. - Oh, good. - Yeah, goody-good. - Good. Good. - Well, good. Good. Oh! Hallway. Fine, Whitney Houston. Got you guys covered on your date. You guys are safe with me. **** First off, I just want to tell you I got some great news. Denisa woke up. Yeah, she's out of the coma. And... looks like she's going to be okay. That's good. That is good. Because, uh, well, she's had a rough time, don't you think, Frank? Or maybe you don't think. I mean, maybe you don't think she had it rough at all. Maybe you just think she... had it kind of normal. Because you know what I think, Frank? I think something bad happened to you too. That's what I think. Bad like what? Come on, Frank. You were abused. Right? Yeah? Probably happened to you when you were just a little guy? And you know what? I'll tell you a little something. The same thing happened to me when I was a little guy. - What happened? - What happened to me? Well, I'll tell you... If I tell you, you got to tell me. Is that a deal? Look, okay. I'm going to tell you if you do. All right. So, I'm 11 years old. I'm taking the train... The six train... to Union Square. 'Cause I'm going to buy a football helmet. And anyway, I get the helmet. I go back. I'm waiting for the train. And I got to pee, right? So I go look for the bathrooms down there. And, uh, there's this guy. And he's just standing there, you know. And he follows me into the bathroom. - What guy? - He's just a guy. Older than my dad, who was, like, 41. And I look. And this guy, he's holding onto himself, you know. So he comes right at me and he grabs me and he's trying to drag me into a stall, you know. And he's, uh... He's got this hand, you know. He's got a hand. His hand... He's got it down my pants. And I just remember, it was like, um... It was like a bony claw, you know. And it hurt. You should have yelled. You should have bit him, man. I did better. I did better than that. 'Cause I took my football helmet and I hit the guy in the face. And he lets go. He lets go of me, just a little bit. Enough for me to turn around, and I smash him again. You know, right in the bags. And down he goes. And then... Pfff! Kill him? Did I kill him? I broke my helmet on the guy. You know what I mean? And then I ran home... 40 blocks. Because I guess I didn't have to pee that bad anymore. Anyway, that's my story. So let's get your story, Frank. Why don't you tell me what happened to you? I changed my mind. You changed your mind? You're kidding me, right? Look, this is your thing, okay? I don't need to be talking about this. Frank, listen to me, listen. This is about... We were just kids, Frank. We were just kids. You think you're ever going to forget the guy that did that to you when you were little? You think I'm ever gonna forget the face of the guy that did that to me in the subway? I will never forget. I will never forget that face. No, I ain't never gonna forget him. That's right. We were just kids, Frank. We were kids. It's not our fault, Frank. You want to shake on that, Frank? Yeah, and you know what else? I'll tell you something. Denisa... Denisa's never going to forget. She's never gonna forget your face either, Frank. Never gonna forget it. So... Hey, Frank. Look, I'm going to believe whatever it is that you want to tell me right now, okay? Because I wasn't there. So was it an accident? Were you high on drugs? You know, did you... Did you not know...

Very casual, very casual. Here we go. Vehicle heading South on Cedar. Merging onto Riverside, heading for the Bronx. So we're absolutely sure that none of our witnesses live - anywhere in the Bronx, right? - I told you no. Hey, hey, don't get too close. I won't. I don't want them to smell the cologne you've started wearing. What is that anyway? It smells like a hooker's purse. Manhattan East Homicide to Central. Go ahead, homicide.

Just said you got out just in time. That's why I thought you might be up for talking to me, considering the option is going back in. - I didn't do nothing. - Uh, sorry, - you didn't do nothing to who? - I was at my sister's - the whole night. - The whole night while what? While Kevin went and shot up that man in the store. - There you go. - He told me we needed to. He said Santana said 25 for each of the witnesses that were going to talk in court. Thousand? Yeah. Not for the cop though. He was only 2,500. Okay. Listen to this. I'm going to, uh, go call the D.A.'s office and, uh, talk about a deal for you. How's that? Excuse-moi. Just, uh... Since we're waiting, guys, will you... Will you help me out, here? Uh, I need a couple of witnesses. It'll just take a second. - Witnesses. - Yeah, just there and there.

Hinds county circuit court will be the focal point tomorrow as the saga of former governor Haley barbour's criminal pardons continues. As he left office, barbour pardoned or modified the sentences of more than 2... Hundred state convicts.

Hood says tomorrow's hearing is just the beginning of a long process and there probably will be series of hearings before the issues can be resolved.
