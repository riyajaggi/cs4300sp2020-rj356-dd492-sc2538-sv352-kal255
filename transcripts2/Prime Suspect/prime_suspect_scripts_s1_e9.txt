 [Police radio chatter] "Remove rudder hatch." "Make sure propeller screws tight. See figure one." Where's figure one? Watch your feet, detective. Huh? Lovely. [Groans] Who am I standing in? Car nails the guy. Almost cuts him in half. Any witnesses?

 Wino says he saw a blue, red mustang with vanity plates. How useful. Is he around? Over there, asleep in the trash. If there's any booze left in that bottle, I may join him. Here, hold this. You find anything on street soup here? I'm not putting my hands in there. Oh, grow a pair, you girl. You, uh, buying a boat, sir? Making a model. For my dead partner's son. [Grunts] [Sighs]

 Bag this. And while you're at it, find another detective for this case. It stinks of "unsolvable." I'm never going to find figure one now. [Scraping sound] [Laughter] [Chuckles] Jane... Hmm? What? You keep jumping me every time I pick up a hammer, I'm never going to finish this thing. You are going to finish, though, right? [Hammer clatters] You really want to talk about that right now? - Uh-huh. About all the work I'm doing for Owen's room? [Gasps] Yeah, you like that, huh? Uh-uh, uh-uh, I-I got a nail. - What? - Stuck in my foot. - I got a nail stuck in my foot. - Oh, jeez. Pull it out, please, pull it out, pull it out. Okay, on three, I'm going to pull it out. - Okay, ready? One... - Ow! You said three. Ouch. Oh, yikes. I know. You all right? I'm fine. Why'd you put the nails on the ground? I'm going to get the peroxide. Ow. This is the kind of thing that makes me almost not in the mood. [Sighs] You know, you're supposed to get a tetanus shot every ten years. Yeah, you're supposed to do a lot of things that I don't do. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is that a good idea? Isn't the nicotine going to mainline right into you through the hole? And the problem with that would be what? My apartment is a damn construction site. Someone's always putting things where they don't belong and not fixing things they're supposed to fix when they're supposed to fix things for a living. Thus igniting your control issues. I don't have control issues. Oh, yeah? Sure. You never need to have the last word neither. Detective Timoney. Detective Duffy. Do you believe in justice, Detective Timoney? Did you spit in this? [Laughs] No. I need a favor, Jane. I caught a case last night. And I'm all... I'm kind of out of my depth on this one, and I was hoping maybe... You would see your way clear to taking it off my plate. I'd sure owe you one. Give me the milk or move. You know what your problem is? Oh, why limit it to just one? You think you're too good for regular police work. I think that you're trying to dump your loser dead-end case on me, is what I think. Oh, sure. If it's not a high profile, cameras flashing, get your face on the TV... Then you don't want it, apparently. Me? A fellow officer comes to you in the spirit of cooperation, asks for a little help... Oh, that's what "take this case off my plate" means. I didn't realize it. - "Faithful..." - That's... "Unto death." Fidelis ad mortem. That is our motto. That is what we have sworn to be. Now, this disgusting display of eighth grade cooty-spraying has no place in my squad. Yeah, but, Kevin, listen. She gave me... - I... no, I-I would suggest... Nay, I would encourage you both strongly, paternally, and with the power to suspend the next stinking goat who pisses me off, to quit the kid stuff and look to your Latin. Skip, unis found that hit and run car. Blessings are bestowed. Timoney, check out the car. Duffy, get the victim identified. Pater et filius et spiritus sanctus. ♪ Amen ♪ what are you working on?

Yeah, so I went out between shifts to grab my... I got this great Wonder Woman outfit, with the bracelets and the rope and the boobs and... So yeah, it was... It was just gone. I mean, the car, with the outfit in it and... Okay, okay, let's back up to the part where you leave the keys in the car. I have to. I mean, Jorge, the lock guy, he lets me park for free. Well, not free, I've got to flash him every night, but... And he needs the keys to move the car. - Right. - Right. And Jorge likes his rum, so... So...Oh, so he's either asleep or down the street having a pop, and he doesn't know what happened to it. Yeah. So one more time... Hey, detective! Remember me? Solicitation bust five years ago. I didn't have the teeth or the 36 ds. Remember? - Uh-huh. Joyce... Something or other. Traci Madonna now. See, Tracey was the street I grew up on, and Madonna was my Guinea pig. Oh, so that would make me, um... Fluffy Hillside. Hey, are you doing vice and homicide now? Or... Just homicide. Hey, wait, wait, wait, hey. Hey, remember when you told me to get off the street? - Uh-huh. - I totally did. Right? Anyway, you changed my life. For real. Thank you. Is that weird? No, it's, uh... lovely to see you. Hey, you're awesome. Yep, I'm Wonder Woman. Awesome! Oh, the Keating family, there you are... No, no, no! Hey, no candy. Hey, no candy! You guys, no. You heard your mom. You heard your mom. And anyway, Jackie, you can't look in there today. I got a surprise for you in there. But you got to be patient, you've gotta be patient. Freeze, turkeys! Hands in the air. Hi, Marie. Who wants a lollipop? Unless I get in there and eat them all first. Whoa, lollies! After dinner. [Laughs] How you doing? Cup of tea? Look at this, a little steering wheel. I have a little boat I'm building Jackie. But you've got to stop giving him stuff all the time. Don't worry, I got a dolly for Rosie. No child left behind. Plus I got a ham for Sunday. Oh, you know, the only thing is, I talked to my mom. I think we're going to go up to Rochester for the weekend. Oh, okay. The whole weekend? Well, they want to see the kids and... Sure, but I thought you guys were just up there. Plus they were here all the time after Jay died. I know. The kids miss them and... it's helpful for me. You know, sometimes I... Oh, sure, no, no problem. I get it. Sure. I know. You got a ham. Spiral ham. And a boat. And a dolly. Well, I guess we'll see you Sunday, Regis. Hey, that's what I like to hear. [Laughs] Regis? How you doing there, Regis? It's a family name. Well, you got anything on the car, Detective Timoney? Torched mustang, reported stolen. - Owner got an alibi? - Rock solid. You, uh, I.D. the hit-and-run guy yet? M.E.'s still picking chunks of gall bladder out of the wallet, so... All righty, I'm gonna go back to my own cases now. Actually, I'm going to need to give you Mr. Squishy. Actually, I'm not going to be doing that, but thanks. Except for how you are. Ask the lieutenant if you don't believe me. He said to pass it on... to you. Seems like I'm being called up for some random drug test. Don't worry, I'll pass. My body's a temple. If you think I'm just gonna take... Hey, excuse me. Can I borrow you for a second? Seriously, what am I, a toothbrush, people? I was thinking I could use your expertise on the hopeful solution of a homicide. Yeah, that's... That's fine by me. So long as she remembers her other cases. Drink a lot of water, Regis. Regis? [Laughs] It means "kingly," all right? Oh, Regis. Also... cram it. Regis. Manhattan East Homicide 85 Precinct Units at 714 East 119. DOA, male shot. Possible homicide. Got a .32 here. Got a holster. Huh, got a wallet. I got an apple. Look, got the crime scene. And got a dead guy in the bathroom. Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Has he got his britches on? I like to brace myself in cases of full-on male nudity. - Full-on clothed. Okay, look. He comes running in, slams the door. They come blasting all the way through, right? Look at this. Two to the chest, one to the neck, one to the wall. One to the toilet tank. Yeah, the water came through the ceiling downstairs, so the super let himself in. That's when 911 got called. It's no signs of forced entry. Mm-hm. - What we got? Look. - Oof. Good-bye, Rick Kantor, 28, Taurus. Carry permit. Not an organ donor. Oh, look at this, Mr. Rick was a rep for an escort service. - Pimp. - A modeling agent. Pimp again. An executive vice president for a website... Tops and Tails. - Cyber-pimp. - And a talent scout - for Studded Pickle Productions. - Studded Pickle. Oh, wow, it's a real renaissance corpse we got here. Studded Pickle is, uh... King Dickens. I used to run into him constantly when I was doing vice. Slippery bastard. - Ooh, we like those. - What else we got here, folks? They're handy. But I don't want an I.D. chip in my head. There's one in your phone, you car, and the 16 cats I'm sure you live with. What makes you so special? Detective Timoney, long time. Mr. Dick-ens. Hey, come on, you can call me King. No. This is Detective Velerio. Do you know a guy named Rick Kantor, Mr. Dickens? Rick, huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Rick is a guy that I know. He send you to see me for some reason? Hey, if you changed your mind about going on camera and didn't tell me first, it'll kill me. Shut up. Mr. Dickens, Rick Kantor is dead. Someone went into his place and shot him. You know anybody who would want to do that? Let's take a little stroll. The undoing of Lacey Garments, huh? Yeah, my Citizen Kane. Girl-on-girl mostly. One of the girls was from England. Actual British. [Chuckles] Ooh, obviously a period piece. Hey, hush now, Janie, the man is explaining his craft. One man's treasure is another man's trash. You can't assign artistic value to a thing without first considering the beholder. - You make low-rent smut videos. Your Citizen Kane... You shouldn't even be allowed to watch Citizen Kane. Art's dead, detective, the Internet killed it. Okay? The trolls out there, they want what they want fast and dirty. Which can be some pretty bizarre and exotic dishes for sure, but... Hey, at feeding time, we all know why we're there. [Moaning] Hey, put a sock on it, Roger. We got company. Nice job, King, ruined the take. I'm not going again. The cake is making me sick. The screechy blonde's my wife. - The icing's giving me a rash. - Hi, wife. I think it's the dye or something. Well, forget about your fire door for a sec. All right? Sit down. I got something to tell you. Guess who went and got himself murdered last night? Your meat sack boyfriend Rick. [Vomiting] [Chuckles] Did you get that? Good. [Coughs] Bam! Magic. Straight to the back please. Jane, is that King Dickens? And is that Montana Ride? Really? Hey, listen, women just got to be there. Us guys, we've got to practice. Vomiting in three, two... - Ada Bullock's looking for you. - Yeah? - Jane, do you mind if I, uh, pre-interview Ms. Ride? You see, I have some questions about the historical accuracy of Lincoln's Dirty Bedroom. Sure, get her to sign your booby while you're at it. Want to know the best part about being Assistant District Attorney? Um, using the ladies' room? Working with detective bureau. That's what I would have thought. Seriously? Hey, uh, listen, I got a big case Friday. Grand Jury case. It's a good one. Good case. I'm feeling pretty good about myself. But, uh, our mutual friend Detective Collins, the poor guy decides to pass kidney stones right in the middle of me prepping him. That's not really a surprise. Stevie Collins never met a protein he wouldn't eat. Yeah, well, poor guy's going to be out of commission for over a month. And I don't know if you heard me when I said that part earlier about Grand Jury, Friday. Sure. Yes, I did. Well, do me a favor, you know? I'm asking you to help me out here. I'll give you the case files. You just come down to the courthouse. We'll bang it right out. Yeah, I'm not doing that. Get some other poor schnook to do it. You're the poor schnook I want. So long, counselor. Is it too late to ply you with liquor? Eh, well, maybe not. But then I'd be all sincere and tell you I'd do it. And then just... not show up. This is ridiculous. You're here voluntarily. Well, I say no, she's on my back with a string of obscenity charges. On your back with a murder charge now, though. I didn't kill Rick. He was having relations with your wife. [Laughs] Montana has "relations" with 20 guys a day on camera. What makes Rick different to that? Business is rough anymore. No, the salad days of the '90s are over. - Salad? - Money's tight? Well, I mean, minimum wage is $7.25. Subway costs $2.50. And what are you going to do with the last $4.75? Either masturbate or eat. - It's a thinker. - It's a thinker. Is that why you started up with Rick Kantor? Financial security? A girl's got to look after herself. And how did your husband feel about that relationship? He punched Rick in the face. Because the guy brought me in some junkie bitch kept nodding off in the middle of the action. And she stole her wardrobe. Well, can't have that. Look, I'm a businessman, okay? There's demand. I supply. Demand isn't patient. Demand isn't nice. Demand wants satisfaction now. And tomorrow, it wants it more. Do I lament the death of film? Of cinema? Of my better nature? I've got to get as much cash out of them as I can in as short a time as possible. And if I'm paying you to help me do that, well, then, you better help me. Or I'm going to punch you in the face. Or shoot you through the bathroom door. We had a whole business plan, Tops and Tails. Um, new website. Porn, but like, self-determining. We get to say what we do. And who. That sounds great. How did you come up with the money for this, uh, business venture? - I-I...Well... - Mm-hm? We sort of, uh... Borrowed it. Borrowed from... your husband? And did he know about that? - Maybe. I-I-I'm not sure. But now Rick is dead. Right? - Uh-huh. Montana. Who do you think killed him? Now remind me again, the night of the murder, you were... Home. I fell asleep watching the Miracle On Ice documentary. Oh, not much of an alibi. I didn't kill Rick Kantor, so... Your wife thinks you did. Nice try. They were stealing from you, you know that? Huh? She and Rick were taking your money to start their own web company. Okay, look, you want to book me on murder charges, go ahead. You got nothing. You got any other charges that you'd like to try, bring 'em, 'cause I'll beat them again. Sit down. You're treating me like a criminal. Do you know how many more rapes there'd be if it weren't for me? Sit down! Now! Okay, you can get up now. [Man speaking in low voice] Help you with something? Oh, hey, I'm Matt Webb. I'm, uh, Jane's boyfriend. The divorced guy, right? Yeah, right. Uh, we're just coming by to meet her for dinner. This is my son, Owen. Good lad, Owen. Detective Duffy. Reg Duffy. Hey, Reg, how's it going? Good. How do you like working with Janie? I... like it fine. She mention me to you? Reg Duffy? What'd she say? I don't know, sorry. I'm not that good with names. But I got your face, I'll remember now. Hey, hey, leave that alone. So I've got to ask, in your movies, you know, you really seem like you're enjoying yourself. Is that true or... Well, you know, it's as real as you want it to be. - Oh, I want it real. - [Laughs] - You lousy, fluffing, gold-digging whore. You steal my money? I'll kill you! [Screaming] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Cool. Okay, I got it, I got him, I got him. Come here. Hey! Hey, ready to go to dinner, buddy? - Hey, listen. - No, you listen. The cops, they I.D.ed that hit and run body. So what? So we don't need no I.D. chips. Wrong, dummy. Next caller. Hey. Any chance, uh, I can get inside... Uh, what's his name? Road kill guy's... Michael Bachman's apartment? The, uh, hit-and-run. Couldn't find any next of kin. And no one's getting a warrant until the judge thinks you've wasted enough time looking for relatives, so... You should've just palmed the guy's keys and gone in on the sly. Think I didn't think of that? Car fused them into his pelvis, pretty much. Nice boat. It is. It's a nice little boat for Jack Keating. 'Cause his father's dead and can't make him a little boat. Which he would've done. 'Cause he was a great dad. A great man. The kind of which is now my responsibility to see that Jack grows up to be. Me and Jay were going to take our pensions and hit the water. I was going to buy a boat. A big one, a... Cabin Cruiser. We were going to go fishing, grilling, swimming off the back. My best friend, his wife and kids and me. Uncle Reg. That would've been great. This is what I got. You watch it with that kid, Owen. Got a lot going for him, you can tell. Try not to ruin it, why don't you? But he's right. The answer to crime is simple. Tag these scumbags like bears so we know where they are. Thanks for the help. Everything got scrambled when Dickens hit my desk. - I've got some DD-Fives here. Now, this one is for Mr. Rick Kantor, who got all shot to hell in his bathroom. Kantor's here. - And this is for hit-by-a-car Michael Bachman. Yeah, next time there's a precinct fight, let's make sure, uh, we toss the guy on Duffy's desk and paperwork. - A well-thrown sneezebag like King Dickens would've ruined that little boat Regis has been working so hard on. That's just mean, Janie. There's Kantor's rap sheet. - That too. - Yeah. You've got kids, yeah? All kinds of kids. Step, biological. Well, I guess that's only two kinds. All right, so what makes a good parent? - Tell me that. - I don't know. Really? Wow. Enlightening. Thanks for sharing. Okay, well, okay, okay... I think being a good parent is like being the giving tree, except instead of giving up pieces of your body for your kids, you give them money. [Laughs] And pieces of your body. So cash and kidneys... That's your secret. Cash, kidneys, and love, yeah. - Yeah. - Business cards. Rick Kantor's business cards. 'Cause Michael Bachman's look like this. I had to separate everything from his wallet from all the guts and gore. Well, then, here's a Bachman and another one. And another one. - Wait, wait, wait. - What? Can you read that? Uh... "Ails dot com." No, no, no. Tops and Tails dot com. - Tops... - Why is that familiar? Why can I hear that coming out of your mouth? Me? Hey, since when do I need some website to help me get my swerve on? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I-I can hear me, too. - Yep. - Um...What was I talking about? Kantor's place, Kantor's place. Remember? You were going through his wallet. This is right, I think this is right, I think this is right. Studded Pickle. Tops and Tails. Tops and Tails! Look, same guy. These guys knew each other. Rick Kantor and Michael Bachman. Got it, got it, got it, got it, got it. - Okay. - Remember? All right, jovial work atmosphere. Nice. How's my hit-and-run coming? Oh, good. Looks like the victim and Ev's dead pimp knew each other. Case just turned from a dead-end loser to a rock-crusher, and it's my hit-and-run now. You gave it to me, remember? What else? I need these two. - Okay. - Got that. Rick Kantor, shot in his apartment apparently by someone he knew. Michael Bachman, randomly run down in the street. And Rick Kantor, we know, is a pimp who solicited actors for the sex films of King Dickens, our prime suspect. You liked the guy that much, why'd you let him go? He had motive, opportunity. Look who wants to be a detective all of a sudden. Anyway, Bachman is the key here. He ties into the Internet business that Kantor had with King's wife. Great lady, by the way. All right, we need to put this King Dickens at the strip club the night of the murder. Access to the hit-and-run car will give us enough to roll him, lawyer or no lawyer. We also need to get into Bachman's place and find something more solid that hooks him directly into King. Exactly. I have an idea for that. All right, okay, everybody. Go. Am I dreaming, or are we going to a strip club? Hey, counselor, you ever answer your phone? Honestly? No, it's never good news. I'm going to do your Grand Jury. Oh, yeah, okay, if I what? Expedite a warrant. Dead guy, Michael Bachman. I can't reach his next of kin, and I need to get into his place. Is this going to turn around and bite me? - Probably...Not. - All right. - Grand Jury. - Uh-huh. Grand Jury, four whiskeys, a steak to be named later. Okay? I got the case files inside. I can't now. I've got to talk to strippers. That's nice. I pity your dull life. [Louder] I pity your dull life. Crap! They gave me D-Strength patches. I'm going to have to use three of them. Hey, you really think King did this hit-and-run? I don't know, I mean, it doesn't seem like his style. His style or capability? I mean, Jeffrey Dahmer worked in a chocolate factory, Janie. Your point being? My point being, all kinds of people are capable of all kinds of things. - Hey! - Look out! Hey, hey, hey, hey, you watch where you're going! Now, you see, take me for instance. - Yeah? - If you weren't here right now, I would be shooting a bike messenger. I am walking here! Seven huge guys, and they got machetes. They got a pile of money. On a table. They got caged turkeys. - Hey. - Hey. So no King Dickens on video off the two security cameras that aren't broken, but they all know him. No one seen him that night. You still like him for it? I love the greasy weasel. And obviously, he's not a stranger here. He could've known about the car. Everyone knows about the car. Hey, excuse me, ma'am? There was a waitress here the other night, Jodi? Uh, is she around? Jodi's been out. I think she's sick or something. Got an address on her? Hey, Ev. Ev! Oh, excuse me. Thanks. You and, uh, Bambi crack the case yet? Hey, look, how many times I got to tell you? Women get all kinds of angry if you don't flirt with them. And angry women do not cooperate. [As Ev] "I speak Spanish, "a little Italian. Enough French to order wine." [As Bambi] "I like wine." - Bye bye. - "I like wine." Shh, you're just jealous. Hey. Uh, how old are the kids? Drew's 8. Sheena's 14. A couple of cuties. They grow up before you know it, huh? If you can feed them. Roxy! Roxy. Sheena, can you come get this dog? You, uh, feeling okay? You've been out of work since the night I stopped in. Oh, yeah, I had a thing. That place is filthy, you know? Of course, it's not like I can afford to be out sick. I hear that. You seem to be doing okay. Dinner, you guys! Hey, the night I stopped in the club, do you remember seeing King Dickens there? - Who? - King Dickens. He's a regular. Don't know him. Every other girl at the club seems to. Every other girl down at that club knows a lot of people I don't know. Sheena, Drew! Hey, let me ask you something. Um... Have you ever heard any of the other girls talking about doing movies? Pornographic movies, that would be. I clock in, sling drinks for ten hours, come home, give half my money to the babysitter. Go to bed, wake up, do it again. I-I don't know anyone or anything. I just do it for my family, okay? You guys, get in here now. Thank you. Have a good dinner. Went over to bachman's apartment. Yeah? He's got some dead goldfish, old milk. Some nothing else. We got his laptop, and, uh, hopefully there's something on here. Okay. Whoa! Oh, my God, it's like Christmas morning. We're looking for Jodi Barret. You got a picture? That's what I'm getting for you, fool. - We need to watch all of these. - Yes. Until we find her. I know she's lying about knowing Dickens. But I need to prove she's lying to find out why. So you're on Bachman's computer. Augie, you're on porn. Just watch these and don't stop until you spot Jodi. Jane, that's going to take all night. Or longer. Bless you. Mmm! Ugh. Oh... Just find her. Buddy, you need an old sock? Oh, my God. I hate sex. It's like, human beings are, like, the most disgusting animals, my friend. You're telling me. I can smell you from here. I'm assuming you didn't find Jodi. Jane, I'm going to need to look at dolphins and rainbows for the next 24 hours. You're going to need to take a shower, is what you're going to need. Great use of manpower there, Janie. Give me a better idea. I said already, bring the smut-mutt in and crack him. With what, Regis? We don't have him at the club, or in the hit-and-run car. And no prints on the gun. Sure, sure. Plus you could never pin him down when you were working vice, and now you're running weak. Hey, Jane, I think I found your girl. While the cat's away, the mice will play. See these sexy housewives and young studs spend their afternoon in pure delight. Between us, we've probably seen, what, 100 dead bodies? But this is kind of awkward. [Moaning on laptop] Amen to that. Milf Masters. It's MILF Madness. These ladies just can't get enough. Right there. Eh... I don't know. Maybe. You can't really see her face. Might be something better on here. The guy was an editor, too. So he's got, like, days of this stuff on his hard drive. Did you search her name? Yeah, but there's no real names. It's... it's all, uh, fancy Savoy, Rebel Flagg, Fuzzy Mount. Traci Madonna? I changed her life. Um, try this. Yeah? Search, um, Rock something or other. Something or other Roxy. Yeah, yeah. Roxy Brookside? Why not? Let's see it. All right... This light's buzzing, man. It's annoying me. Fix it. There's your boy. King Dickens. He's so gross. Come on, how tight you want it? - And there's Michael Bachman, hit-and-run victim and cameraman. I want her eyes. I want... I want you to see inside her head. Hey, Rick, what's up, bro? This your friend? Oh, yeah, that's a good one. And there's Jodi. Yeah, I know him from, uh, work. He drives me sometimes. Now he's helping you make a little real money, huh? Say, sit down, sweetheart. Well, real money's always good. Yeah. Hope he told you this is work, though... it's hard work. Is there where... where... where we're gonna... Yeah. [Chuckles] Mike, she wants to get right down to it, huh? That's good, I like that. Yeah, just hold your horses. Jodi, right? What are you, like 35? You got kids? I got two. I... Uh, a son and... Yeah, Rick says the daughter could be a real star. Oh, nice. We like stars, right? Always looking for them. You ready? Look into the camera. Right there. Okay, all right. Man, I'm going to have to loosen you up a lot, huh? Hey, there, so today we are here with a true MILF. 35, two kids. Bet they're real proud of you, right? I just want to do this and get paid, you know? Oh, yeah? All right. Then get on your hands and knees. Let's go. You want to get paid? Get on your hands and knees. All right, I'm gonna make you eat a little humble pie. You understand? [Belt cracking] I don't hear you. Do you understand? Wait, stop, please. [Crying] I didn't hear you, what's that? Stop, please. [Laughs] Where do you think you're going, huh? Did I say that we were done? We're not done yet. Listen... Yeah, bet you're thinking about your kids now. [Belt whacks] Stop, please, no, no, no. I hear your daughter... I hear your daughter is really pretty, huh? All right, let's see. Let's see that pretty face. [Crying] We're ready. Let's get these guys in here. We're ready to go. 'Cause you've just gone to pieces on me. [Crying] Was, uh... was King Dickens at the club that night? No, the, uh... the other one. With the... With the cam... camera. Michael Bachman was there. Yeah, he, um... He, uh... Lou, can you go get us some hot tea, please? [Sniffling] Hey, do you... you want a cigarette? Yeah. I'd love to have one with you. Unfortunately, I just quit. [Sobs] I'm not... I'm not like that. I just... I needed the money and I thought... It'll be okay if I just remember w-why I have to do it. It'll help us turn the corner, be able to... to breathe. So you saw Bachman at the club. He was looking for me. He, uh... Rick had told him my... my daughter's name. Said they could make her a star. She... She is 14. She's o... she's only 14. So then what happened? They know where we live. I can't watch her all the time. I have to work. She's young, she wants things. I can't buy 'em. What if they do? What if they go to the house and make promises and then... So move. Take your kids and run. Where? Someplace else I can't take care of them? I don't even have the job I got now. Did you kill Rick Kantor and Michael Bachman? What about King? Didn't you want to kill him? [Sobbing] I don't want to kill anyone. I just wanted to keep my girl safe. You arrest me, what happens to my kids? Do they... do they have to go someplace that you... you... You send them or.... Oh, God. Hey, hey. Listen to me. Listen to me, all right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Look at me. I had this case once, similar case. Woman. Good person, bad, bad situation. She got arrested for murder. Thing is, with this woman, she didn't get convicted for murder. She was so terrified, so scared about the safety of her kids, that, uh, she snapped. She snapped. Yeah. She, uh...Lost her grip on reality for a while. It was like she was in a dream. She didn't know right from wrong. You understand what I'm saying? I think so. Matter of fact, she couldn't even remember the bad things that she'd done. She kept saying it was like a dream. Crazy, confused dream. Maybe that's... What happened to me. You need to be sure. - I... well, I-I can't... I can't really remember now. It was all like a... Like a crazy dream. Yeah. She, uh... Also had this great lawyer. Uh, what was his name? Um, public defender, Hynes. - Hynes. - Something or other. Smart guy. Th... thank you. Thank you. I don't know what you're talking about. The video put her on the ropes, Lou said. She was ready to fold. He was calling child services. And then she lawyered up. Right, which is what I don't get. Well, I don't know what to tell you. Tell me why. I might not know the details, but I know the upshot. I just don't know why. Why would you do that? You're a cop, Jane. We arrest the guilty. We don't decide what happens next. And frankly, we shouldn't be allowed to. She just got a more even playing field, reg. She hasn't won the game. Hasn't even started. And we're guilty, too, of the things we don't do. [Groans] Oh, God, I'm going to have a field day. Harassment, bogus obscenity charge, what else... murder? No, but rape, though. Rape? You're smoking the evidence locker. I've got signed consents from every one of those girls who walks in the door. You've seen them. Yeah, I have seen them. They say nothing about choking and beating. Let's go. I got consent, I got... Ah, here's a legal fun fact for you: The abuse in your video, it constitutes coercion. That negates consent. How's that humble pie taste, Dickens? - [Thud] Oh! - Watch the door. You wanted to see me, Skip? Yeah. What the hell happened with this double homicide? I'm asking you straight, Reg, 'cause this smells. Did Jane muck this up? Girl demanded a lawyer. It happens. If you say so. Think I'd say so if it didn't? Fidelis ad mortem. [Laughs] Okay, my friend. Listen... I had a little chin-wag with Marie Keating. - Yeah? - Yeah, and, uh... You've been a rock for her. And not that anyone's ever prepared, but I don't know how she'd have gotten through Jay's dying without you being there for her and Jack and Rosie and... and no less than Jay would have expected. And I know, you know? He appreciates it. He better. [Laughter] And not for nothing. Marie does, too. The thing is, uh... That's what's making it hard for her to tell you how she needs things to be now. Yeah, and what's that? She wants to move the kids upstate to be with her parents. You know? So she has a support system. She's got a support system here. I know. She knows that, Reg. That's why she hasn't done it yet. But she wants to. She wants to leave. To forget a little. For a while, you know? And you have to let her. Let her go, Reg. Okay? Please. Of course. Sure. Get two for the price of one if you call now. But hurry... this amazing deal won't last forever.
