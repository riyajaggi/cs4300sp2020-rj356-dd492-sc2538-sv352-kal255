 [Indistinct chatter] How's that Manhattan treating you, Evelyn? Tastes like more. Table near the wall needs three ciders, please. You sure you're not gonna get in trouble? For what? Jane's boyfriend's little boy is in a school play tonight. It's ten minutes long. You blink, and you'll miss it, and I'm not gonna spend the whole night facing off with Matt's ex-wife to watch a ten-minute play

 about how hippos learn to share. - Hmm. - And plus, you need me here. - I'm working, right? - You're working? I've been waiting since the damn Earth cooled. There's that missing chick again. Her husband is pleading for her safe return. Claudia Ward is 5'7", blond hair, green eyes, with a tattoo of a butterfly on her left wrist. Hey, Janie, she looks kind of like you, if you'd smile ever, and 20 years younger. Thanks, Iggy. You just keep hitting that bowl of peanuts like there's diamonds at the bottom--how about that? I'm only kidding you. I'm sorry, sir. What would you like to drink?

 This is a robbery, okay? Okay? Everybody, hands on the bar! - Hands on the bar! - Okay, calm down. Hands on the bar, everybody! Put your hands on the bar! The register. The register! Sure, sure, sure. It's just money, all right? - The bottom one, too. - Got it. Of course. [Mumbling] Now! - I got it. - Come on! It's obvious that you've done this before. I wouldn't try to trick you, all right? Are we good? All right, now get back from around there. Come on, get from behind the bar! Everybody, empty your pockets! Empty your pockets! - What do you want to do? - Nothing. I don't have my gun on me, plus we don't know if he has a partner outside, so let's just try to keep him calm and not get anybody shot. Shut up! [Man speaking indistinctly on television] - [Shouts, whimpers] - Y-you're all right, Evelyn. Sure she is. Hey, everybody, why don't you just give the gentleman what he wants so he can go-- does that sound good? Ah, come on, that's my last 20, you-- Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, h-- Everybody in the back, now! Everybody in the back! Come on! Move it! Come on, everybody. Everybody move to the back now! Hurry up! All right, stay here-- 30 minutes. Anyone who comes out sooner gets shot. [Door slams] [Clattering] Well, thank God there was a cop in the bar. I don't have my gun on me. And what were you thinking mouthing off to a guy who had one in your face? That necklace was a priceless family heirloom. That necklace was a prize from a box of cereal, Evelyn. You're talking out of your hole now. [Toilet flushes] Oh, for the love of-- - Who is that? - Me. What's everyone talking about now? Nothing, Malachi. Why would you not have your gun on you? I was a cop, I'd never not have the gun on me. What did you dummies want-- the--the damn showdown at the O.K. Corral? You're alive, aren't you? You're welcome. All right, so it was a gold chain-- we got that. Very expensive, though. A very expensive gold chain. - I understand. - Did you write that down? I did. It's right there, ma'am. That's a pretty woman right there. I'm happy for you. We'll have somebody look at that, okay? You just hang in there. I'm gonna go talk to these guys. Thank you. Detective Rivera. - Extra-hot latte. - Oh, look at that. Thanks. My fat ass thanks you. That ass is not fat. Mm. Well, look at it while I walk away and then decide. Hey, thanks for waiting. I'm Detective Rivera, robbery. Uh, she's homicide-- Jane Timoney. Oh, yeah, sure. Nice to finally meet you. Gerry Matthews gonna be here? Nah, he's taking his kids to the shore this week. - Can I ask you some-- - What about Reed? He's working the wolf pack robbery, and Machado's in court, and Boyd's in court, and Jackson's working overnights, but I'm here. Can I ask you some questions? - Of course. - I can just, uh-- I can just tell you. He's about 6'1", 170. Where were you guys in the bar? Was anyone between you and the robber? You're seriously gonna do this by the manual? Why don't I just tell you? Because sometimes our witnesses get confused. I'm a detective, Detective. No matter who they are. Extra-hot latte, right? - You what? - Extra-hot latte? Oh, really? That's so sweet. Thanks. - You got two lattes. - Yeah. You want one? - You going home? - Uh-uh. I'm gonna go to the dorm and try to sleep for a couple of hours before my shift. [Exhales deeply] I'm really sorry, Dad. Yeah. Next time wear the gun. [Clicks tongue] You know what? [Cell phone rings] Timoney. Why didn't you have your gun? 'Cause I never not have my gun. Well, you're an inspiration to us all. Okay, we got a 20-something female, blond. Worker named Montoya found her this morning. You're looking a little tired. "You look tired" means "you look old." You look short. How's that feel? Uh, hello, there. You're Mr. Montoya? I'm Detective Timoney. This is Detective Calderon. I almost ran her over. She looks bad. Well, it's a good thing you found her, Mr. Montoya, 'cause now we can do our job. That's a good thing. I just never saw a dead body before. Hey, look at me. Mr. Montoya, it's all right. It's gonna be all right. Just tell me this-- this section of the dump is from Soho. - Is that correct? - Yeah. Yeah, that's right. All right, guys... Pull any of the magazines or mail you found around the body, anything with an address-- see if we can figure out which dumpster the body came from. And, uh... And show me her left arm, please. This is Claudia Ward, the missing woman. She ain't missing no more. ♪ Prime Suspect 1x03 ♪ Bitch Original Air Date on October 6, 2011 == sync, corrected by elderman == The body of Claudia Ward was discovered at the City Dump. Police say they are now investigating and looking for possible suspects. [On tape] You are more beautiful than the stars. [Repeating sentence in french] She was tenderized, huh? Are you as sweet as your eyes are? What do you think, iris? - [Repeating sentence in french] - What he said-- somebody pounded her like a skirt steak. If I help you learn English... What the hell is this, Iris? I'm going to Paris this spring. [Tape stops] - So, murder weapon? - Don't know. There's no imprint pattern. Could've just been fists. Both cheekbones are fractured. The bridge of her nose is collapsed. Both eye orbits are fractured. Well, somebody was pretty pissed off at her. Mm-hmm. We're gonna bring the husband in to I.D. her. You want me to get a blanket or something? No, I want to see how he reacts. Well, what if he didn't do it? Then I make Lou here tell him we're sorry. [Man crying] Oh, dear God, my sweet girl. [Sobbing] Is this your, uh, wife, Mr. Ward? - Is this Claudia? - Could you-- could you-- could you please cover her? - Iris, thanks. - What--what happened? - Who did this to her? - It's okay, Mr. Ward. I'm so sorry. I know you're upset. But could you come down to the squad with us, please? Yeah, of course. Could I--could I just use the bathroom, please? Yeah, sure. We'll wait right here for you. I'll show you where it is. [Continues crying] He's a good crier. I'll give him that. [Breathes deeply] It--it was through my volunteer work. Sh--she was only 17 when we met. And what do you do, Mr. Ward? Um, I'm an interpreter for companies who do business in Japan, but I sometimes volunteer at a youth shelter. She was a ward there. How old were you? Um, 34. Hmm. I know. I know. But nothing happened for years. [Sighs] But then we--we fell in love. She was the sweetest woman I ever met. [Inhales deeply] Okay. So, tell us about the night she disappeared. Um, she had a class-- art history. And, um, we always met for dinner after at Grey Cat. But, um, missing persons found out that the class had been canceled. So, um... She must've decided to--to do some shopping or... I don't know what. I-I went to the restaurant the same time as usual. She texted me. She said she was running late but that she would be there soon. What time did that text come in? 6:42. A-a-at around 7:00, I... I called her again, but it went right to voice mail. And did you hear from her again after that? No. A-a-at 7:30, I-I left the restaurant, and I went home, 'cause I thought maybe that I'd misunderstood her and that she would be there instead. And you know the rest. [Sighs] You know, I-I-if you want to... Search our home or my office or-- that's--that's--that's fine. All you have to do is ask. Thanks so much, but we're done here for now, sir. You know, in a case like this, it helps us to get to know the victim. So... We're gonna take you up on your offer-- look around your place. - Let's go now. Uh, actually, we have a couple of things to do first on the case, but, uh, we'd like to stop by later, if that's all right. Okay. Yeah, whatever-- whatever you guys need. I just--I want to find out who killed Claudia. So do we. Well, I guess he didn't kill her at their place or the office, then, right? I love to know where the crime scene isn't. - What are these names again? - Agnes Bledsoe... Lecia Alvarez... Marty Fitzsimmons. Keep looking! You know what? If I find a dead baby in here, I'm going home. Listen, we got to pinpoint this address, okay? It's important. I talked to the people upstairs. Didn't see nothing. Didn't hear nothing. So she couldn't have been killed here. Someone would have seen or heard it. Well, it's a good spot to dump her, though-- no cameras, a lot of windows. It's well planned... Smart. - Malcolm Ward seemed smart. - He does, right? - Yeah. - Guy knows Japanese and crap. Let's talk to him again. We're done here. Come on. Wait. What, "we're done here"? Then why exactly am I rooting around in this dumpster amongst the cat turds? Will someone please explain that to me? Yeah, why are you doing that, Augie? I was wondering the same thing. Hey! Lou said that you asked me to. [Jane chuckles] I thought it was funny. Mr. Ward, the dumpster that Claudia's body was left in is in Soho, and the text that she sent you came from the same area. Is that all you have? I keep on coming back to the class being canceled. Now, it's odd that she didn't mention it to you. Maybe it was canceled at the last minute. The Professor said it was on the syllabus. Well, I just assume that she forgot. Well, e-either way, she didn't have class, so why would she want you to think she did? She had an affair. What? Six months ago, she had an affair. Uh, excuse me. And you didn't think this was worth mentioning the first time we talked? Seems like it's an important piece of information. Look, I didn't want to drag her name through the mud, okay? It's our private business. We're private people. And now that she's gone, I just--I don't want to remember stuff like that. Okay. So what was the name of this individual-- the one she had the affair with? David... Hollister. David Hollister. He built this dining-room table. Do you know where David Hollister lives, sir? No, I don't, but I know where he works-- Soho. With the discovery of Claudia Ward's body investigators' search for the killer is intensifying. Yeah. Yeah, we, uh-- we had a thing. She broke it off six months ago. Is that the last time you saw her? Yep. Were you angry at her? Why are you asking that? Oh, uh... because someone beater till she died and then threw her in a dumpster about a half a block from here, and I was wondering if you were angry enough at her to do that. Where were you last Friday? Uh, I was here... Uh, working-- I make furniture. Anybody see you making this furniture? I don't know, you know. They heard me. I, uh... I turn up the music loud, so, uh-- so I don't bother the neighbors. Mm-hmm. Why don't you guys talk to her husband? She was terrified of him. I used to worry he hit her. Really? Do you have any proof of that? No. I got to tell you something-- this sounds like a made-up story to me, David. Look, I was here. Great. So hopefully your neighbors can verify that, because I got enough here to get a warrant to search this place, easy. So did he do something? What did he do? Did you see Mr. Hollister last Friday night, ma'am? I didn't see him, but I heard his stupid music. Can you tell him the music is worse than the power tools? We'll be sure to pass that along. Hey! Crime scene found samples of Claudia's hair and fingerprints at Hollister's... - Uh-huh. - No blood. The hair and fingerprints could be from when they were banging. Which is exactly what even a crappy lawyer would say. Where was that woman killed? Please tell me that. Well, what are you going to Club Med for? You don't have kids. That's like going to a dog park without a dog. Hey, Reg. Did you get the boyfriend's credit card statements? I'm serious, Brian. You're gonna be miserable, not to mention the pool-- full of baby piss. So enjoy that. I need those statements, please. Well, don't say I didn't warn you, all right? Unbelievable. All right, thanks a million, Brian. Appreciate it, man. Hey, sunblock. With all due respect, Reg, and I sincerely mean this, I have Sweeney breathing down my back to get this thing done. And could you just maybe just do your job? That was the head of security at American Express-- old buddy of mine. - Yeah. I find that a lot of police work is about building relationships. You know, you'd be surprised what simple politeness can accomplish in this world. Page three-- guy says he never goes out to dinner, and yet there's a big charge a week before Claudia gets murdered. Nice little romantic Italian place on Bond-- wine bottle, candleholders, soulful glances, BRIC-a-brac-- maybe you should check it out. Don't bother thanking me. No, really... Don't thank me. Um, could you please, uh, get the Ward's property records next? I still don't have a crime scene. Hey, Jane... I, uh, brought over some mug shots for you to look at. Actually, this is not a good time. Sorry. Yeah, sorry about last night. I never had a cop as a witness before. Oh, I got that. And maybe I was a little intimidated. You kind of have a reputation-- a good one, but, anyway... I narrowed down the pictures so it would be easier for you. I'll look at them later, all right? Right now I'm trying to close a homicide. I'm trying to close a robbery-- your dad's, actually. You a little tired, or you always act like this? REG! Oh, my God, Reg! Oh, hey, sexy! How you doing? [Laughs] And you're wearing red. Oh, I didn't know if you'd be here or not. I'm good. How have you been? Let me see you. Let me see you. You have been working out. Nah, nah, that's just there-- all genetic, baby. [Laughing] Uh, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. Uh, have we met? - Augie Blando. Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Lou Calderon. How are you? - Hey. - Evrard Velerio. - Hi. Yeah, it's nice to meet you. This is Carolina Rivera. Uh, me and Jay took her under our wing when she was just a baby D.T. back in robbery. Hey, you know what? Let's go out and get drunk... - for Jay. - Oh! I got to go to court. How about later? Let me get you my new cell number. - Excuse me. - Yeah. - Oh! - Oh, wait, wait. I got it. Officer down. - Hold on. - Hey. There you go. Now, you can keep that. - Thanks. - Here, I got you another pen. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Nice meeting you. - Take care. Calderon? - Calderon? - Yeah? A second? Uh, since you apparently lost the pen race, would you, um, mind checking out a restaurant tip on our murder case, for the love of God? Thank you. So why'd you lie, David? Why did you say you hadn't seen her for months? Because I knew what you'd think. That you're the one that beat Claudia to death, right? You dumped her body. That's exactly what we're thinking. Waitress said you made her feel real uncomfortable. She didn't even want to come to your table. So you want to tell us what you and Claudia were fighting about so hard? She came to my place that night, all right? Out of the blue. We had sex. And then she wanted to go eat at this place we always went to, and I thought... You know, I don't know what I thought. And I said something dumb about us being back together, being happy. And then she said it was all just to say good-bye-- like, forever. How did you feel about that? How'd you feel about that-- her leading you on like that? Bad. I mean, I loved... Loved her. I didn't want her to leave. No, no. She wanted to leave you. That's why you killed her, right? You know, we found Claudia's, uh, hair and fingerprints at your place. Because she was there. You killed her there. - I didn't-- - You killed her. I didn't kill her! I loved her, and the last thing she ever heard me say to her was that I hoped she'd never come back. Are you gonna arrest me, or can I go? You just let him go-- like, free? Yeah. Right out the door. Have a nice day, murderer. [Knock at door] Come in. Hey. [Door closes] Sit down. Thanks. Why'd you let the boyfriend go? - I thought he was looking good. - Ay. He's a dumb lug with fists like hams and no confession, no witnesses, no physical evidence, no scene. Plus, I haven't closed the loop on the husband yet either. So? What about the husband? He cried. But he's creepy. And no confession, no witnesses, no physical evidence, no scene, plus an alibi. [Groans] We arrest the wrong guy, we don't get a mulligan. You have to be sure. I know. All right, who do you think it is? I don't know. I-- I mean... The husband? Even while he was crying, like... Some people want you to watch them grieve, you know? Mm-hmm. So you could see him beating a woman to death with his hands by himself? Listen, I can see anyone doing anything if they get mad enough. So, yeah, I could see him doing this, but right now it's just a feeling. No, no, no. It's never just a feeling. It's always coming out of experience or... Who knows? It may not lead you right to the killer every time, but it is never just a feeling. [Drawer opens] I mean, if somebody... Was to put a gun to your head, who would you say it was? [Glass clinking, liquid pouring] The husband. Cheers. With the investigation into who killed Claudia Ward seemingly at a standstill, police are under increased pressure to arrest a suspect. So why are we going back to see the husband again? 'Cause I want to see his face when I tell him that we're arresting the boyfriend. Only you're not arresting the boyfriend. You let him go. I'm aware of that, Augie. Thank you. Hey, is that Detective Rivera coming back anytime soon? Carolina. - Why do you care? - Right. What do I care? Beautiful woman, doesn't have a chip on her shoulder, great smile, laughs at people's jokes. You're right. It's awful. It's disgusting. - You know what else is awful? - Huh? Steak... Porn. Stay here. What? Why? 'Cause you're bugging the crap out of me is why. - Just so you know... - Huh? You have the worst personality of anyone I've ever met in my entire life. [Doorbell rings] Detective Timoney... - What can I do for you? - Hello, there, Mr. Ward. I hope you don't mind me dropping in on you like this. Of course not. No, please come in. Thank you. I don't think I told you before, but you have a beautiful home. Oh, thank you. Probably gonna have to move soon. - There's too many memories. - Sure, I get it. Oh, no, thank you. I actually just wanted to stop by and let you know that, uh, we're close on David Hollister. That's great news. Oh. At least I... I think it's great news. I thought it would make me feel better. Did you know that he and Claudia saw each other about a week before she died? Did she tell you about that? No. Because as far as you knew, it was over between them, right? That's right. Is it unusual for a woman to be a homicide Detective? Um, not for me. Huh. You have kids? - Nope. - Why not? Busy, I guess. Lucky. May--maybe you haven't met the right guy yet. Who would that be, you think? Oh, I don't know. Don't know you. No, you don't. I'm a real catch. And I'll let you know when we make the arrest, okay? No, no, I can let myself out. Thanks very much. [cellphone ringing] Timoney. So I looked into the past relationships of both these clowns. All the boyfriend's exes say the same thing--great guy, romantic, charming. Probably a gentle lover, probably... Washes your hair. - What about Malcolm? - Couldn't find anything-- no exes. But you asked me to look into property. He's paying rent on an apartment in Queens... For someone named Susan Whitney. - Mistress? - Maybe. Just texted you the address. Okay. - Um, Reg? - Yeah? I really appreciate this. What? What? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Are you being sarcastic or something? I was being nice! Malcolm Ward pays rent on an apartment in Queens. Let's go see what the hooker looks like. [Cats meowing] This is a very nice... Uh, place. Does Malcolm pay the rent? W-what? [Raising voice] Sorry. Does Malcolm pay the rent here? I don't see that that's any of your business. But, yes. He's a wonderful son. When I sold my house, he found me this place. Is that right? So your last name is Whitney. Well, that was my second husband. He died of throat cancer. Does Malcolm visit you often? He comes to visit me every Sunday. That's very nice. [Cat meows] A man should visit his mother. Do you like cats, young man? - Love. - [Chuckles] Well, this one's pregnant. Leave me your card, and you can have first pick. That is so nice. Thank you. Uh, so did you spend a lot of time with Claudia and Malcolm? Did they seem happy together? Malcolm just came over, mostly by himself. She was allergic to cats, but, yeah, he seemed happy enough-- as happy as a man can be married to a whore. [Scoffs] Uh, excuse me? She didn't appreciate anybody or anything. Oh, I liked Kasey much better. Uh, Kasey-- who's Kasey? Oh, he was with her for years, and then suddenly, poof, she's gone, and he and the whore are getting married. And she wanted me to toast them at the rehearsal dinner. Wait. The--the whore is Claudia. I toasted, all right. I said, "Here's to Kasey," and how this should've been her. [Chuckles] [Clears throat] Ma'am, did Kasey have a last name? Yes. Monrad. [Cat meows, doorbell rings] I'm sorry your tongue hurts, but you still have to clean your room. Hey, there. Kasey Monrad? Uh-huh. I'm Detective Timoney. May I come in? - Sure. - Thank you. I'm not sure what there is to know. I saw on TV about his wife, but I haven't seen Malcolm in years. So why did you guys break up? Um... We just didn't have a lot in common. I mean... I was only 16 when we met. Huh. That's the same as Claudia. Do you know how she died? Mm, the news didn't say. She was beaten to death. Okay. Does that surprise you? Why would it? Honey... Why would it surprise you that Claudia got beaten to death? Are you that afraid of this guy still? What's he gonna do to you now? He--he's not a super criminal or an unstoppable force of nature. He's--he's an expensive suit with a bad haircut and a psycho mom that belongs in a horror movie. He's a runt. And he likes to beat up runaway girls with daddy issues. You hear me? How'd you get away? I got pregnant, and I h-had an abortion. No way was I gonna have his baby. I don't blame you. But after, I was bleeding, and I ended up needing him to take me to the emergency room, so he found out then. [Sighs] He waited until I got better first, and then when I came home, he beat me so bad, I thought I was gonna die. But then after, it's... It was like I was dead to him. So I didn't get away. He let me go. I'm not gonna testify. I hope you know that. I hope you know you won't have to. You know, I think I chipped a tooth on one of those old gargoyle's damn cookies. Pecan sandie, my ass-- more like pecan razor blade. - I don't care. He did it. - Did Kasey just tell you that? No, I mean, I know he did it now. Let's go back and look at that alibi--really look at it. Hey, Duffy, can you do me a favor, please? Yes. Go back and check Susan Whitney's properties now. No, I still don't have a crime scene. Thank you. What-- why aren't we driving? I don't know where we're going. The restaurant, the Grey Cat. Oh. [Engine turning] He signed in at 6:32? Yeah. He, uh, said he'd wait at the bar till his wife got here. So he didn't start a tab till 6:57? You usually let people sit at your bar for 25 minutes without ordering? 'Cause I don't understand that business model. He signed in at 6:32. Okay, listen... So all Malcolm's really got is the text. Could he drive from here to the dumpster and back in 25 minutes is the question. Across town, Soho rush hour? Hell, no. I agree. Could he have run it? Smart. - So he's got Claudia's phone. - Uh-huh. He talks to the hostess. He checks his coat with his phone in it. - Right. - Right. And then he runs to the dumpster, and he calls himself from her phone. - Right. - Yes. And he drops her phone in a sewer or whatever he does with it. He runs back to the restaurant, goes into the bar to wait. Get it? - All that in 25 minutes? - Yep. I guess it's doable. Why don't we find out? Here... Careful with the hat. Time me. - You ready? - Yeah. Set... Go! All right, this is gonna be interesting. ♪ Da da da da da da da da! ♪ She runs like an oompa loompa. It ain't happening. [Breathing heavily] [Coughing] Oh! - [Laughing] What-- - Oh, my... Oh, my God. I don't even know what to say about that! Oh, my God. Wait. She's hurting. [Coughs] Ah... You need me to call you an ambulance? New plan! - You ready? - Yeah. [Clears throat] And go! Jeez. Wow. - What is he--a Kenyan? Well, are Kenyans seeded in the New York City marathon? 'Cause Lou was. New plan. Okay, average Augie... Let's see something completely mediocre. All right. Lou, call it. All right. Ready? Go! He looks pretty mediocre to me. [Laughing] [Laughs] Malcolm's alibi is dead... With a three-minute cushion to go back in the bar and order a commemorative bourbon old fashioned. - Thank you very much. - Can we do that? - Can we do that, please? - Yeah, we're doing that. Oh, my God. [Coughs] You know how to get rid of those? Hmm? Lemon wedge, angostura bitters, sugar-- you hold it in your mouth. It shocks your system. Do that. No, do it. 'Cause you're gonna keep on hiccuping until you puke. - It's really good. - Do it. How do you even know this works? I grew up in a bar. I know everything. [Cell phone ringing] Uh, Timoney. Where are you guys? Uh, M.E.'s office. Well, tell her to shake those cocktails a little quieter. I can't hear you so good. How's Malcolm's alibi holding up? It's not. It's him. So he used to beat his ex-girlfriend, and he sent himself that text from Claudia's phone. - What else? - Nothing else. That's it. Well, not to armchair-quarterback you, but the D.A. is gonna want more. - I want more. - So get more. Evrard's got the phone records from the Ward's house here-- that's when you're done talking to the M.E., of course. What'd he say? He said we should finish our drinks. Can we get a check? - Wake up. - Ow. There was a call from the University of Michigan admissions department to the Ward house lasting eight minutes the morning Claudia died. Apparently Claudia was enrolled for next semester. You look like crap, by the way. I haven't slept, and there were some drinks earlier. So what do you think? Do you think Malcolm knew about the University of Michigan? He answered the phone. The admissions officer said he kept asking if she was sure she had the right Claudia Ward. She was getting away. She was gonna leave him, right? Mm-hmm. Hey. You still got my pen? Still got your wife? I'm gonna look at the database, I swear. Actually, I was in the building, and I wanted to run something by you. - You got a sec? - Uh-oh. Yeah, well... Three days before you dad's bar gets hit, there's a robbery in the East Village, similar description-- African-American, about 6', 170. Then the next night, another bar uptown gets hit-- again, similar description. Then three hours before you dad's place gets hit, another bar in the village gets robbed-- same description. Mm. Same type of gun? Same snub-nosed .38. Uptown, then the village, and repeat like that. I think it's a pattern. I'm not getting any support from my squad, though. [Scoffs] It sounds good to me. You should pursue. Excuse me. [Cell phone ringing] Hey. Susan Whitney's got a storage unit. Stuff from her old house and what looks like a rack of Claudia's clothes. - Did you get a, uh-- - Yes, I got a warrant. Yes, I executed it. Yes, crime scene is with me. Yes, you should come. [Indistinct chatter] Down there, Detective. [Inhales deeply] Ammonia much? - This guy tried to clean up. - Yeah, he tried. Didn't do a very good job, though. I figure he steps aside, lets her go in first. Then he... He hits her from behind. She goes down. He's probably kicking her. She's crawling, trying to get away, but... There's nowhere to go. But this... So he's pounding her... Mm. Slamming her head on the floor. She put up a fight. At some point, he either picks her up, or she gets up, and he smashes her face into this. [Scoffs] Wow. What's his ex-girlfriend's name--Kasey? Yeah. I hope she knows how lucky she is. Sometimes history doesn't exactly repeat itself, but it rhymes. He's here. You ready? [Exhales deeply] Hey, maybe you ought to hit the head first. Yeah, I could pee. Go get him. Kill it, Skip. Did you pee? Hey, there, Malcolm. How you doing? I'm--I'm fine. W-w-what's going on? They said you have some new information. Yes. I'm happy to say that we do. But would you mind talking down the hall? It's very crowded in there tonight and not very private. Sure. Fine. Right here. Would you care for some chocolate? - It's good. - No, thanks. I'm--I'm fine. Come on, live a little. You're at your fighting weight. I can tell. Ah... Right here. Come on in. Have a seat. What is this? Oh, that's your wife, Malcolm. I just wanted to tell you that, uh, we found the crime scene. - You did? - Yes. Your mother's storage unit. Well, I mean, Claudia had keys to that unit. She kept clothes there-- spillover from her closet at home. She was always saying how her closet was too small. She went there all the time. I-I don't know why she would take David there, though. Right. I also wanted to tell you we're no longer looking at David. He's been cleared. Well, do you have any other suspects? I mean, have you checked out the guys at the storage place? Yeah. No. [Sighs] Hey, did you know that your, uh, wife was going to grad school in--in Michigan next semester? Yes. Of course I knew that. You didn't think you should tell us? I didn't see what it had to do with the--with the case. Oh, I forgot. I forgot. Um, we talked to one of your ex-girlfriends-- Kasey Monrad. She told us how you used to beat her up pretty bad back in the day. Kasey. - You remember her, don't you? - Of course I do. Look, I'm not gonna go into a whole thing here, but Kasey has a history of mental illness. So forgive me, but consider the source. [Sighs] God, you guys are really grasping at straws here, huh? Kasey. God, that poor girl. You--you show up at her house, and--and you start making her think that she knows something. Claudia had a little more spunk than Kasey is what I think. Kasey would've never had the guts to, uh, fool around on you, but David Hollister-- that was an act of full-on revolution. He must've been amazing... For her to risk getting caught. Although a guy like him after a guy like you, that must've been like a cold beer on a hot day. You can't stop once you start. All I know is that she came back, and I forgave her, okay? It hurt. It wasn't easy, but I forgave her. You get a new one at the shelter? Did you pick one out already? Claudia, Kasey. How old's this one--14, 15? Oh, and I talked to your mother. Did she tell you that? Yes, she mentioned something about it. Yeah, did she? Good. What a lovely woman she is. And she loves you. She is in your corner all the way. And you know what? When my mom was around, she was in my corner, too, just like your mom-- swinging at anything that could hurt her little Malcolm. But he's a big boy now. - I don't need her in my corner. - Don't you? I guess you don't. You don't need anyone to fight your battles for you, especially, uh, a woman, because you fight your battles against women, right? [Sighs] You know what I've been wondering? What if you guys had had a daughter instead of a son? What would've happened then? I mean, how would've you felt about that? Would you have ended up beating your little girl, too? What are you talking about? The baby. You knew Claudia was pregnant. [Scoffs] No? So... Claudia finds out she's pregnant, and she wants to have it-- not like Kasey. So she plans for herself and the baby to get away from you, but you find out, and you know what you do? You beat her to death, and you throw her body in a dumpster near David Hollister's place, so it looks like he did it. 12 weeks old, definitely yours! You can't really tell from the picture, but the M.E. said that it's definitely a boy. You killed your son, Malcolm! - Don't you tell me what I did! - Hey! Sit down! Sit down! [Breathing heavily] [Shouts] Bitch! [Mellow song plays] ♪ ♪ [Groans softly] Whose sonogram was that? [Sighs] Um... An admin aide upstairs in Warrants. She was actually four months along with a girl, but she was happy to do it when I told her why. Hail Mary, but it worked. - Good thinking. - Thank you. You're welcome.
