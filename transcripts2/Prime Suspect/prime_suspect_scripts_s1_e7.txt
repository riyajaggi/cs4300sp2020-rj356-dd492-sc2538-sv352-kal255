 8,318 days. But who's counting? 8,318 days till what? Oh, her son is up for parole next week, and she wants me to write a letter supporting his release. Apparently he's straightened himself out. This is a case of yours? Yeah. Stupid. Was high as a kite, went into a bar, picked up a girl, brought her home, killed her. Says he blacked out. It's gonna be a sad day when they all figure out that the whole blackout thing makes us more suspicious,

 not less, right? Hmm. Anyway, he is where he's supposed to be. Yeah, I'm just gonna go up there and talk to him, you know? - Mm-hmm. Well, he, uh... He didn't get 8,000 days. He got life. And life means life. Where's Calderon? I don't know. Somewhere around here, why? You tell him to come find me? Why, do you have a case? What? No, um, trust me, this is way more up his alley than yours, okay? What is that supposed to mean? I don't know where he is. Maybe he left. Maybe what else are you gonna do? Oh, okay, you want it so bad, you got it. The five-year-old boy yesterday, Ben Martin. What? Not... not a kid. The kid who had the seizure at the fancy preschool? Yeah, there's a possibility that there's a brain injury that's not related to an aneurysm or seizure. And until they rule there wasn't, you're gonna treat it like there was. Oh, there he is! I had a case for you, but, uh, Jane took it. Why would you do that? Boy, are you gonna laugh when you find out how lucky you just were. Do you know who's watching your kids? The unexpected death of a five-year-old student at one of Manhattan's premier nursery schools has parents asking... is preschool safe? The kids don't seem to have registered what happened, but there's been some concern expressed by a few of the parents. And so we always let the caregivers stay if they're worried about anything, so... Was Ben Martin a clumsy kid? Did he fall a lot or... No, not at all. I mean, our students are always under careful watch. And in fact, lately Ben had been exerting more control over his body. - Uh-huh. As opposed to what? Well, we'd been having some problems with him. He had attention issues, impulse control, temper tantrums. And what changed? I'm not sure. I mean, we pressed really hard to get him screened for A.D.H.D., but his parents were resistant. Maybe they changed their minds, but they aren't great communicators. Well, did he fight a lot? Did he throw toys or punches or what? We don't tolerate that kind of behavior at forward steps. Yeah, but it does happen, right? I mean, listen, they're kids. It's more fun to throw a book instead of reading it. But this is not that type of environment because we don't encourage that kind of behavior. Right, so nothing ever happens here, it's a cone of perfection, we get it. Can you just show us the crime scene, please? Sure, it's right over here. Thank you. So this is where we found him. Mm-hmm. And this is our only bathroom, and the EMTs didn't tell us that we couldn't let the other children use it. Could Ben have slipped maybe? You know, like, he hit his head? No, no. We always make sure that these floors are dry. Always. They're saying he fell? No, they're saying he didn't. They're saying no one has ever fallen at that school in the history of the world. Can't this be, like, a seizure? You know, something that's undiagnosed? There's no evidence of a seizure or any other spontaneous injury. How about a toy? A toy getting thrown, hitting him in a soft spot. That's a thing, right? How old are you when that goes away, the soft spot? - Like, two years old. - Fine. It wasn't a toy. Ben Martin's brain injury? Come here. - Go ahead. - Let me show you. Was a coup contrecoup injury. Feels like boom... boom, huh? Right. I still don't get it. But it's more like this. Come here. A crushing blow. Hmm? Accounting for... The black eyes, the accumulation of blood in the forehead. This boy died of a blunt force trauma, okay? I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. Have you told his parents yet that this was no accident? That's not my job, hon. It's yours. Are you saying that someone... Yes, sir, I'm saying that someone killed your child. I'm very sorry. Someone... someone... How... Uh, was it at that school? We're looking into that. Are you saying that it's possible... Do you think it's one of the... one of the k... One of the kids would have done this? I don't believe that this injury could have been caused by another child. Why? What kind of injury was it? Just one that would be really hard for a child to cause. - J-Josh... Josh, someone... oh, God... - Who did this? - I slept all morning. Through breakfast, everything. I didn't even get to say good-bye. He was just gone when I woke up. I'm so sorry, ma'am. It's all right. It's all right. He hated his teacher, Mrs. Meinhoff. Ben cried every morning that he didn't want to go to school. He said she was mean. - She's an old woman. - She was a mean old woman, and he was scared of her. Just...Just tell us what we can do to catch the person who did this. Listen, you and your wife, you need to help each other out right now. Okay, listen, just let us... Let us do the rest, okay? Again, we're very sorry. Thank you for your time. Could... Could she be wrong? The examiner? Or could you be? I-I don't... I don't think I could live knowing that someone did something to my baby and I-I wasn't there. - I don't think I can. - I understand. Thank you for your time, folks. Hey, hey. Prime Suspect Season 1, Episode 07 Wednesday's Child November 10, 2011 ==sync, correction by dcdah== for www.addic7ed.com Hey. You seen Timoney? Nope. Sorry. Hey, lady. Hey. Detective Timoney around? I think I might be close to something on the guys who robbed her dad's bar. I haven't seen her. Well, tell her something for me? If I must. I'm thinking these guys are working this pattern. They go back and forth, uptown to downtown, always the same kind of nicer-than-divey pub-style bars with kitchens. I feel real good they're gonna hit this one place in the West Village next. Tell her. Hope you're right. For you, not for her. Stop it. Well, I am camping out. I don't care how long I have to wait, I am closing this. I'll call you if I get bored. You mean when you get bored. I mean, I'll be calling you. What are you doing? I'm taking him to the surgery, - you're picking him up. - I know. Seriously, I rearranged my whole morning - to take him to the hospital. - Meaning what? - You rescheduled your manicure? - Right, I forgot. You're the only one in this family with anything to do. Just... you can leave, okay? I got this. Okay, where is he? Did he have breakfast? - He's making it now. - Exactly. Hey, pop. Who's that? - I'm still taking you, dad. - Yeah, no. I just stopped by to make sure you didn't forget that you're not supposed to have anything but water for 12 hours before your surgery, but you did forget and what a shocker. No, I was making that for your sister. An army marches on its stomach. Oh, so now we're quoting Napoleon? - And she's a vegetarian. - Vegan. - Vegetarians eat eggs. - Whatever. So Jane's picking you up at the hospital, and she won't be late because I have to be somewhere. Busy life, that of the unemployed. - Jane. - I'm between jobs by choice. "Between" implies that there was a job and that there will be another one. Look, Jane... You see what happens? - Hey, dad? - What? If you meet a really cute nurse, will you make sure that the anesthesia wears off before you ask her to marry you, please? And... Thanks for the sandwich. Yum. Hey! Look at you. Look at you. I went to college in here. Working on a master's now. Master's? In what? Psychology. - Psychology? - Yeah. I been a peer counselor in here for a while now. Really helps with that. Well, maybe you could peer counsel cons on the outside. You know, I mean, if... if... I don't want not to be with my mom when she dies. Shane Cook had only three years with his mom before she died. Now, you know they're gonna say that, right? I had no... tools for living. Lost 'em, threw 'em away. And their daughter, their mom. She suffered for it. - I killed her for it. - And what's different now? - Now? - Yeah. I'm clean for 19 years. And what happens if you start drinking again? Or getting high? Look... What am I gonna tell you about people, detective? Everything you know? What you've done? Nothing. Huh? That's right. So if you don't think you can help me out it's not like I'm gonna be happy about it, but... I'll try to understand it. Hey, it's Rivera. Hey. How's it going? What are you doing? Nothing. Who's gonna stop you from coming? No one. You can come hang out with me. Can I? Sure. Will I? Fine. I guess so. All right. See you soon. Bye. Dude... That food in your mouth, is it in there long enough for you to actually enjoy it? This Mrs. Meinhoff sounds like a real bitch. How's your second order of fries? You gonna eat 'em all? Four complaints against Ben's teacher last year. Says she's "mean," "impatient," and "doesn't like children." Listen, I bet my paycheck that your file has the exact same complaint. Doesn't make you a murderer. I don't get paid for working with kids. You want 'em that bad? Have them. Next time, don't order a salad. I'm just watching my cholesterol. My fries don't count? Mean... Impatient... Doesn't like anyone. Hey, Iris. What up? Please tell me you're calling to say it was an aneurysm, and I will name my first-born, which I will never have, after you. What? - Thanks, lady. - What happened? Toxicology report for Ben Martin came back. Positive for A.D.H.D. drugs, as in the same drugs his parents don't believe in using. Huh. Scuzie can I order something else, please? I'm starving. You? Thanks for bringing your client in to see us. - It's a huge help. - Well, don't thank me. I advised her not to speak to you. I didn't ask for a lawyer. Well, that's between you and your employer, all right? Okay. Do you know who could have been giving Ben medication, ma'am? He wasn't prescribed anything, so... - Mm-hmm. So is it possible someone could have given Ben pills that belonged to another kid, maybe? No, not at all. It's a very organized system. Right. Okay. Can you take us back to that morning? In the interest of being cooperative only, yes, go ahead. Ben arrived to school at 8:15. - And who dropped him off? - His nanny did, Lucy. But, uh, she... She didn't leave right away. She, uh, played with Ben outside till about 9:00 A.M. - Is that normal? - It's not unusual. Our policy is to let the caregivers stay if they insist. Normally it's to hang a backpack up, you know, that sort of thing, but she was really hovering over him, and that's when Ruth asked Lucy politely to go. - Mm-hmm, and did Lucy say anything to you? No, not... not to me. But she kept asking Ben if he was okay. And did he seem okay to you? He, um... He-he said, um... That he had a headache. - How'd he take that? - Worse. He keeps on crying. He says, "b-but you said everything was gonna be okay!" I said, "Georgie, I'm a cop," right? "You just killed somebody. "At least I got you drunk before I took you downtown. You're lucky I did that!" Rivera. What? Oh, damn it. I'll be right there. What happened? I messed up guessing where they'd go next. They just hit a place four blocks over from here and they're gone already. - Idiot. - No, you're not. Hey, hey. You're not. You're fine. Let's just go over and check it out. It's not over till it's over. Can you tell me if you see him here? That's him. That's the little... right there. You're positive? Normally, when a straight guy like that wanders in here by accident, he looks around, sees what he's gotten himself into, and then he slinks out the door. But this guy, he was looking around forever, eyeballing everyone, and then... bam... Pulls out the gun and puts it in my face. Oh yeah? And what'd you do? Kid doesn't scare me. Besides, I thought it was a starter pistol, and I told him that. And I guess that's why he shot me... or shot at me. You're a lucky man. That little turd, he was pretty shocked when he realized he didn't hit me. And that's when you hit him with the vodka bottle? Forehand. Hit him in the sweet spot. Took out at least two of his teeth. Probably still down there somewhere if you need 'em. I can't believe I was so close. You know he lost teeth, he might have broken his jaw or who knows what else, and... He's gonna need help, you're saying? Right. Well, St. Luke's is the closest. It's right around the corner. No, send uniforms there. Then you go to the second-closest, Beth-Israel, right? Because he's gonna try and be smart. Boo-yah. - Come with me, it'll be fun. - I gotta... nah, I gotta... You know... It's, uh... What are you doing? Come on, let's go. All right, I-I'll go. - That way. - Yeah, I know. Yeah. I'm sorry. Stop. - That's him, right? - Oh yeah, that's him. All right. - Hey. - How you doing? You don't look too good tonight, sir. You know that? You want to open your mouth for us? - Mm-mmm. - "Mm-mmm"? - Huh. Let me see your hands. Put your hands up here. See your hands there? All right? - Oh, missing two teeth. - Oh, dude. How about that? You know what? Be better for whistling. Don't forget to put them under the pillow - for the Tooth Fairy, all right? - Yeah, you are under arrest. Been looking for you. Your daughter's not in trouble, ma'am. We just need to ask her a couple of questions - about Ben Martin. - That's where she is. Working. She said she's staying late. Really? Because I just called Mrs. Martin, and she said she'd left for the day. Then she went to her boyfriend's house maybe. I see, so what you're telling me is that she wasn't planning on seeing her kids tonight at all? I don't know. She'll be back later. Right. Okay, can we have her cell phone number, please? I don't know it by heart. You don't know your daughter's cell phone number? Uh, do you have a phone of your own? Yes. Great. Well, let's scroll through the history, and you can show me which one is hers, how about that? Hold on. Hey, little man. You doing your homework? Yeah. Our teacher's making us do a report on sharks. Sharks. Wow. Listen, is this the computer that, uh, everybody uses? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Even mommy? - Yeah. But she never lets me use it when she's home. Really? Oh, that sucks. Hey, uh, would you mind if I check on something? Just want to see if the Yankees are winning. - Sure. - Just take one second. Thanks. Just use the mouse? I'm not very good with computers. - Oh, there we go. Wow. - Whoa, hold on. Hold on. - Hold on? - W-what's up? This isn't the Yankees game. Yeah, it is. Right there. Upper-left-hand corner. - No, it's not. - It's not the Yankees? No, this is not. These are bus tickets. Oh, my... oh, you're... - What are you doing? - You're right, these are... These are bus tickets. I'm sorry. You know what? My fault, my fault. Back to the sharks. Thanks for your help. Finish your homework. Oh, so you don't have your daughter's number programmed in your phone? That's weird. - I don't know how to. - Uh-huh. Maybe you should come back when Lucy's back? - She'll be back tomorrow. - No, she won't. What a surprise. Interesting. Thanks for your time. So she bought a one-way ticket on the 10 P.M. bus. - Right. - She misses that one, there's not another bus till tomorrow. She won't miss it, believe me. I say we go down to Chinatown and we lurk till about 10:00 P.M. And you know what's good lurking food? - Huh? - Dim sum. No, I got something to do first. Oh, come on, Janie! Some shaomai? A little congee? - You know what's good? - What? Some steamed, deep-fried chicken feet. I will meet you there later. - You're gonna love it! - All righty. You'd never even know that you were eating feet! - Uh-huh. - Unless you look at it. You don't want to do that. Hey! Where is he? They're bringing him down. I told you I would be here. Thank you. - Well, you just never know. - Uh, yeah, you do know, because I said. What happened to the thing you couldn't miss? I told them I was gonna be late, and good thing too, since you are. Oh, really? Like, uh, three minutes? What if they finished early? That happens, you know? And then what, he's just sitting there waiting? Wondering? Hey, you. Hey. He's still a little dopey from the anesthesia, he might be a little silly. He's always dopey. Uh, keep him hydrated, he needs a few days of rest, and, uh, call the doctor if you notice any bleeding. In general? Or out of his... Ahh, Janie, I am trying to remain fascinating to this young woman. - Mm-hmm. Did he ask you to marry him yet? You don't need to call me stepmom... Kim is fine, okay? I'll take over from here, Kim. Thank you very much. Let's go. Ah, my girls. Where would I be without you? Nowhere is where. Oh, my g... What, do you have to leave? Oona, would you ever take it easy? - Leave Jane alone. - Oh, right. She's been looking after you since you were just wee. - Don't yank her chain. - What am I doing? Nothing. Never got to be a kid so you could be one, Oona. Ugh, I thought people coming off of anesthesia were supposed to be silly and fun. - She's watching us, you know? - Who, me? I am? - Watching you? - Your mother. Your mother's watching us. She's always with us up there. You think? Then I guess they don't have booze in heaven. Well what if she's not here yet? She's fleeing, Augie. She's here. Well, let's just hope you're right, because you see all these people waiting in line? They're not gonna take too kindly if we hold this bus up. Am I right, sir? Good talk. Hello, everyone. I know you're all anxious to get on the road, especially those of you that are planning on hitting the Indian casino, and the sooner that you help us out, the sooner you'll be able to get to penny slots and Pai Gow. All right? So whoever is not a female in her 20s from Trinidad named Lucy, please stand up. You're definitely not Lucy. Not Lucy, not Lucy. And you're not Lucy. Lucy... Ah, Lucy! How you doing there? Lucy, let's go. Thank you. Win big. How come you were running? You should know that we're homicide, we're not I.N.S., so if you're illegal, you should do something not to be, for sure. I don't care about any of that. Six months, I'll have my papers. I've been studying for years. I know the Star-Spangled Banner by heart. My mother? My mother's been here 40 years. She sings the same song. ♪ O say can you see ♪ ♪ by the dog's early bite ♪ - Where is she from, your mom? - Puerto Rico. You'd like her. She was a full-charge live-in on the Upper East Side my whole childhood, pretty much. I bet the two of you... Two of you could exchange some stories, huh? I can't live in. My kids are too little. It was pretty hard on us. Her too, you know? We pretty much only saw her on Sundays, and then she was always tired. Not too tired to make us go to church though. Lot of work. Lot of work raising someone else's kids. The way they want you to raise them. That's right. They tell you how they want you to do it, and then they leave. My mother? She'd cheat a little. You know, give them, like, a little candy bar when they were at the store counter. Let them stay up a little bit later. You ever do that, or no? She felt so bad for them sometimes, you know? You feel bad for them? For Ben? His teacher tell me he have A.D.D. And that if he take medicine it would help. But I know Mrs. Martin won't ever do it because she say she don't believe in pills. But it would help him. Helped my son. Is that why you were running? 'Cause you gave him your kid's medicine? I just wanted him to be good. I hoped it was gonna help him calm down. Did you give it to him the day he died? He wouldn't eat his breakfast, and I can't give it to him until he does. So he was acting up that day? Ben say to me so many times, "Lucy, I don't want the kids to be mean to me." "I don't want mommy to be mad at me." I tell him, "You have to share your toys." "You can't hit and cry when you don't get your way." And he'd say to me, "Okay, Lucy." "I promise." "Tomorrow I won't cry, and I'll share, and mommy will be happy." But he'd go to school and the kids would be mean, or he'd be loud or he'd break something and she'd get mad. And he would cry. He'd cry and cry. The child never had one friend. Only his little brother... and me. - Hey, Lou. - Yeah? Remember when you got mad at me for stealing this case from you? - Yeah, that was pretty dumb. - Yep, it was. Hey, Mrs. Martin. Mrs. Martin? - Hey. - Hey, are you all right? What's going on? - I'm good. I-I... - I wanted to talk to you. - Where's your husband? Oh...I don't know. Hey, are you... are you... Are you on something? - Are you sleeping? - I'm fine. I-I... I-I-I don't sleep. I'm not sleeping now. I want to know where my son is. Come over here. Over here, come on. Do you know where my son is? We're gonna find out who did this, okay? But we need to be able to tell ourselves - that you can get through this. - That's right. - Listen to me, listen to me. - Mmm. You need to sleep, you need to eat, and you gotta stop beating yourself up. I'm not... I'm not doing that. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. I want to... I want to go home. I'm gonna go home. I'll get you a cab, okay? All right, all right. I won't touch you. Not gonna touch you. That is so disgusting. So um, how do we pinpoint the time of the injury? Could he have been injured a while before he collapsed? What's "a while"? I don't know, two hours, or more? He's not gonna be walking around more than two hours with a trauma that severe. So you're saying it's impossible? It's impossible... to believe. But it could happen? I had Professor in college, neurobiology, he'd always say, "the brain is fascinating "because we know so much about it but we don't understand anything we know." Look, Jane. If the investigation demands it, I can broaden the time frame, but only because with a traumatic brain injury I would never, ever be sure of what exactly happened. So Ben Martin could have been walking around for two hours? He could have been injured even before he got to school. Oh, and if anyone at school knew he needed help, he'd be alive right now. Like I said, it's the brain. Anything's possible. Yeah? And when I find out who did this to this little baby, I'm gonna kill 'em. That's possible too. Your husband around? Oh, he went to the office. Just for a few hours. You holding up okay? No. I don't sleep anyway, but I'm not sleeping. And not knowing what happened to him is destroying me. Me too. I mean, I'm like that too. Uh, would you mind if I used your bathroom? I had a little too much coffee today. - Sure. It's over there. - Thanks. Thank you. Um, the toilet doesn't... You want to go to the master bathroom. It's this way. Yes. Thank you. Excuse me, Allison. Would you mind if Lou watched Gray for a minute so you and I could talk alone? Sure. Uh... Yeah. Hey, Gray. You want to go see a police car? Come on. All right. I'll let you use the siren. How about that? He's, uh, great with kids. Uh, would you mind if we go upstairs? - Sure. - Thanks. Now, I, uh, want you to take me through Ben's morning before he went to school that day. - I told you, I was sleeping. - Right. So just take me through what you think might have happened. All right, now it's this way, Ben's room. It's very nice and wide open, so you can probably hear Ben. Well, no, I mean, not if my door's shut or television's on. Oh. Was the door shut and the television on that morning? I don't remember. - Try. - Well, I... I can't. I was asleep. Look, I-I have insomnia, so Lucy and I have an arrangement. I do the nights because the mornings are too hard for me, - so she does the mornings. - Right, so... She probably couldn't keep him quiet that morning... He was probably being a little jerk... and you woke up and laid hands on him. - Is that right? - Is that what she said? Because Lucy, she hits her kids. - Really? - She's told me that before. Listen, hon, I just found these in your bathroom. So... so what? Those don't mean anything. Hey, here's a little something. Ray Milland, from that movie Lost Weekend, he used to hide his in a lamp. Most people wouldn't think about looking there, but my mom used to hide hers in the same spot. Well, they don't mean anything. It was her favorite movie, you probably never even saw it. Well, it meant something in my house. It meant we don't make noise in the morning so we didn't wake up our mother, who might've been drunk from the night before. My mom, by the way, one night, years ago, stinking drunk, she drives out in a storm, veers into traffic, she gets thrown from the car and dies on the spot. My sister Oona was four, so she doesn't remember a thing, and I was 13, so I remember everything. And I gotta tell you, a part of me is really glad it happened that way. Well, that's a horrible thing to say. Is it? Why? You feel sorry for who? For her? What is that? I wonder. See, I'm glad it happened that way, uh, so something else didn't. Something worse. Something like what you did, Allison. No. No! No! You think you're a good mom? You know what? I want you to leave. You are not one, Allison. You are not a good mother. Please, can you just go? How long until you convince yourself that what you remember didn't happen? Huh? How long till you get so mad at Gray, huh? That mad. I tell her how I need it to be, and she says she understands, but she doesn't. A cough wakes me up. A light switch. And he's in here yelling at her. Just stomping his feet and saying, "No, Lucy, no." And... so I come in here and I tell her to leave, and I said, "Ben, you're gonna put on your shoes right now. Right now." And he spit in my face. He told me he hated me and he spit in my face. And what did you do? What did you do when he spit in your face? Huh? What did you do when he spit in your face? I took... I took his head... And I hit it against the wall. Just one time. And... he didn't even cry. He didn't say anything. He just... he just got really quiet... and... and then he got up and he... he just put on his shoes like such a good boy. You're not going downtown? Where you going? Squad. You want a ride? That's like 40 blocks. And Duffy just went in and was like, "mmm," opened his mouth and there... Oh! Hey, what are you doing here? Oh, you know, I was just... Hey, guys, how you doing? I was just telling them about you holding the perp's nose closed to make him open his mouth. Stop, it was your case. You closed it. Stop stealing your own thunder. This one, right? Yeah. So, uh... Listen, I, uh... I thought maybe we could go and grab some lunch or something. Sure. You like Thai food? No, but whatever. Probably got something that won't kill me. Oh, no, this place is great. They have lots of stuff. My boyfriend gets this "drunken tiger" thing. Allen, from fugitive squad. Thai food... probably got spring rolls, right? - Yeah. - Everybody likes spring rolls. Yeah, come on. It'll be adventurous. Yeah. Good-bye. - I know. - Well, I hope it helps. Thank you. Thank you. Come in. Hey. You wrote that letter? - Yeah. I-I did, yeah. - What letter? - The letter to the parole board to help the guy who killed Angela Cook get out of jail. Angela Cook? Your old case Angela Cook? - Why would you do that? - Oh, look at this. A united front. Well, because we're supposed to all agree on the "putting them in prison" part. Kinda why we're all here. Yeah, well lookit. Brian O'Malley wasn't all-bad then, and maybe he's not all-good now, but... I don't know. Maybe he was sick and he got well? That's what it seems like to me anyway. You a pod person all of the sudden, Kevin? What the hell even is that? Yeah, does this O'Malley even know right from wrong? "Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof." Don't we have worse guys to worry about out there than this guy, huh? I think we do. All I'm saying is, your prayers and compassion might be better served on somebody who deserves it. Whatever. It's done now and it's on me, so... So... Here's hoping this O'Malley can keep a lid on his homicidal tendencies then. - I'll drink to that. - I'll drink to anything. Good speech though. The good and the bad. The sick, the well... The other thing. Okay. 'Night. Listen, your friend Rivera's up for the next open slot here, you know that. Up for...Here? Homicide? Yeah, she must've asked her boss to push her. You know he and I go back a while. So? What do you think? Eh, she's a good detective. Solid. A friend of mine, like you said, but... This ain't robbery. The stakes are different here. But yeah, I don't know. Well, that's not exactly the hard sell there. She'd drive Jane out of her mind for sure. There's that. Yeah, that... That's not a good reason... Whoa. I send three shirts to the cleaners, I get two clean ones back, and one with some damn blood on it. Now are they trying to lose my business? Or is this somebody's bad idea of a joke? Don't look at me. Ahh... Okay. It's on. It's on. Front page! Not the first time you've been there, of course, but... Nice just the same. Yeah, feels pretty, uh, [Sourly] bad. - Why? - Did you read it, pop? Then you know. She even kinda looks like mom. - I don't see that. - Well, she was rich, and she liked booze and pills, but otherwise pretty much the same. - It's not, Janie. - Why? Because we had you to protect us, and that poor kid didn't? Otherwise, pretty much the same. Hey y'all. I'm back. - It's not the same. - I bought five more copies. Why would you do that? Excuse me for being proud. Did you see your picture? I'm gonna go lie down. Just had major surgery, in case anybody remembers. Come on, dad. Just had some polyps scraped out of you. Man up. God, I wish I had those cheekbones. You want something to drink? No, thanks. Good girl. ==sync, correction by dcdah== for www.addic7ed.com
