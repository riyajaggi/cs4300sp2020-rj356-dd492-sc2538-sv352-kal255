 Hey, Amanda? I'm not gonna bug you with any more questions. All right? Me and detective Duffy, we just want to make sure you know that you're safe now. And if there's anything you want to tell us, anything at all, we want to hear it. No matter what it is. Okay? [Knock on door] It's okay. You're okay.

 Amanda, this is Sarah. Sarah's a doctor. She's talked to a lot of kids who have... She's talked to a lot of kids. Amanda? I'm gonna sit here with you while these guys go right outside for a minute, okay? Thanks, doc. You can make it as loud as you want. Nothing to housekeeping who found her, nothing to the e.M.T.S who checked her over, nothing to me, nothing to you. Maybe she'll talk to the doc. I don't know. She was where, downstairs?

 Where's that claw game she was playing? The lobby, left of the elevators. Desk guy said he gave her quarters for dollars. Far as we know, she played the game, couldn't grab any of the cheap, crappy toys with the claw, and ran out of money. She came back up here and found them. [Camera snaps] So...Father stabbed in the chest. Mother's throat cut, what else we got? Family checked in this morning. Visiting from pellum lake up near Albany. Now they said something about taking the kid to the Broadway show. Crime scene says we're looking at a big knife. Maybe 15 inches. That's it? You want to give us a second? All you had to do was talk to some kid who wasn't talking back to you. Where's the luggage, they not have any? [Coughs] It's in the bathtub. I think they read that article where that's how to avoid getting bedbugs. If you want to avoid getting bedbugs, I wouldn't sit on that chair. Credit cards, I.D., but no cash. Still doesn't smell like a robbery to me. Well, maybe it started as a push in, you know. And then uh, one of them mouths off, robber gets angry, and starts stabbing everybody. Hey, reg, Jane, come on. Every camera crew in the city is in the lobby right now. So we need to be thinking about getting her out of here before those ghouls find out that there is a her. That's all we need. Guy who killed her parents who thinks he got away with it seeing her on TV or in the paper. What about the service elevator? Nope, service elevator and the stairs lead down to the back of the lobby. That's where you're saying the camera crews are, so even with a blanket over her head, they're still gonna know she's a kid. So, ideas? Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. One at a time! [Crowd shouts questions] One at a ti... again sir, as I said, we're not going to be making a detailed statement. But uh, rest assured, we're going to be talking to anyone that has any direct information about the crimes that were committed at this hotel. Okay? So thank you very much and as soon as I have something more to give you, I will. Thank you. [Overlapping shouts] All right, fellas, time to play maybe. Oh, I'm a son of a bitch at maybe. - Oh, yeah? - Yep. Then maybe Louis and I should go grab a beer while you solve this case then. Go right ahead. Why'd the killer use a knife and not a gun? - 'Cause he's puerto rican. - Watch it. Or maybe because a knife is quiet. - So this is a careful guy? - Careful guys wear gloves. Careful glove guy gonna come in here, knifes these two goes down in an elevator? Not likely. Maybe it's crowded. So maybe he takes the stairs. Which leads out to a lobby. Careful glove guy's not strolling through the lobby with no blood gloves on, augie. - Okay, he takes the gloves off. - He maybe takes them off. Yeah, but not in here because we didn't find any gloves. Right. Takes them off in the stairwell. With his bare hand and maybe leaves a print. Maybe. - They call it single-blow trauma. Like a car accident or a hurricane. Or experience it in whatever way she did. Walking in to find them. So this single-blow trauma gives a timeline for when she's gonna talk again? So that's it? You can't do nothing for the poor kid? I just got off the horn with Amanda's aunt, the mom's sister. Yeah? Let's talk about if uh, the kid's okay to travel. It'd be good to get Amanda back somewhere she feels safe. When can the aunt get down here? She can't. You're gonna drive her back up to what's it, uh... What's it, uh... - Pellum lake. - Yeah. - That's nice. - I'm doing it? Yeah, yeah, you and Jane. - Sidebar. - [Mumbling indistinctly] I need to sidebar on this topic. Denied. Remember to gas up the car. Uh, excuse us. If this is about, um, you needing a woman, then maybe you should take shorr. Because she's very good with the little people. That's a good idea, shorr can do it. She's always yammering on about going up to the beach. You two were her first points of contact. If she's gonna feel comfortable with any of us, it's gonna be you. So go voucher for food and incidentals and get on the road already. All right? [Chuckles] Excuse us. - This is a double-homicide... - Thank you. - Yeah, thanks. Which is why when you get Amanda home, you're gonna do the victimology, the personal history, the background, the associates, y... Pellum lake local cops can do that. I want to work this end. Get on the road. You know how to use this thing? No? Here's the volume, okay. Here's the playlist. My friend Evrard, I'm so sorry, but he loves merengue. There's other songs on there too. But seriously, merengue's not so bad. So...Okay. You're not even gonna bring a change of clothes? Not gonna be there long enough to need it. Really, you just pretty much guaranteed that a car part's gonna break and they'll have to order one from the next county over and we'll be there for a week... Since when do you smoke? - When irive. - No you don't. I've been in the car with you a bunch of times, and you do not do that. On car trips longer than three hours, you better believe it. You think you're driving? - Yeah, know why I think it? - Why? He did signal, you just weren't looking. Putting your blinker on once as you switch lanes is not signaling. That guy needed to be made an example of. You shouldn't get to make an example of anyone. You drive with your right foot on the gas and your left foot on the brake. Why would they have egg salad? A burger joint with egg salad is weird. That's gross. Should have taken an antacid first. Thank you for the food we eat. Thank you for the world so sweet. Thank you for the birds that sing. Thank you, God, for everything. Prime Suspect S01E08 "Underwater" By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es ==SPREAD THE WORD== She uh, didn't say anything until then. Till she said grace. That seems like a good sign, huh? Even though she hasn't said anything since? Well, guess the hotel wasn't very nice, was it? Looked okay on the website. Amanda was really excited. She was hoping there'd be a pool. So do you know uh, what your sister and her husband were doing in New York, exactly? The took Amanda to see 'Wicked' on Broadway. What was I gonna say? What did you want to say? They didn't have the money. I mean, Rick hasn't worked in 18 months and Molly's the cashier at a pharmacy. Did you notice anything different about them lately maybe? No, they're just regular people. Hmm. Why would you ask that? They've just been robbed at a hotel. Why would you ask if they've been asking... we have to look at everything. Can't rulet out unless we've looked into things. No, we really need your permission to go through Molly and Rick's stuff if you don't mind. I'll get the key. Thank you. Better call the local constabulary. Let them know that city folk with guns are poking around. Hey. We've got to go out for a little bit. You want me to get you anything from your house? Okay. Well, we'll come by on our way out and uh, say goodbye. Right? Yeah, I was wondering that myself. I served them with foreclosure papers a couple of weeks ago. Ooh, and how'd they react? Well, they were embarrassed mostly, I'd say. You a hunter, detective? I've murdered plenty of fish. Meat, I buy. How much is this worth? 3, 400. Hey, Reg? Looks like someone broke in here. And took what, exactly? Ring, phone, come on, call me back. Come on, ring, dummy. Ring, ring, ring. As you might have guessed, gentlemen, I got a whole mess of latent prints off the stairwell doorknob up at the girl's hotel. Worth a shot. Oh indeed, 'cause there's only one print that's got a little blood smeared on it. We're looking to match it. Hmm. What you guys doing? The girl's dad's cell phone log had seven missed calls from the same number yesterday. No messages, local number. So I call it, right? And a guy picks up and he says, "do you have the stuff?" To which I reply, "yeah. Oh, I got the stuff." Whatever the stuff is. To which he says, "all right, I'm gonna call you back and tell you where to meet me," but he hasn't called yet. That's 'cause you spooked him. See you should have let me do the talking. Okay? [Overlapping arguing] You should have let me do the talking. Okay, 'cause we know that I'm the only authentic one. Excuse me? The only authentic what? The only authentic detective? Come on, come on. Listen, I pick up the phone I sound like the guy that's got the stuff. Okay, no matter what the stuff is, I sound like that guy. Compared to you. First of all, we don't even have the stuff. All right, what we have is a phone. And our victim is from upstate cow country, not the Bronx. So he's supposed to sound white? - Um, you are white. - Oh... [phone rings] Shh, shh, hey. - I'm puerto rican. - Guys, shush! Hello? Oh yeah, I got it right here with me. Yeah, oh I know where that is. Yeah, okay. I'll see you there. Oh, I'll see y there. See, tt's what I mean. I told you. I'm the authentic one. I'm the only one... you owe me an apology. Told you. 3:00. It's pretty quiet out here in the sticks. I can hear my thoughts. That's not my favorite thing. The woods are full of raccoons. They got little hands, I don't like that. So what about this dead couple, huh? They're broke, but they go on this trip. They're killed in their hotel room. But the perp leaves the credit cards there. And their house is broken into, but all this valuable stuff is still sitting around. Well, we'll pull the bank records and phone logs tomorrow and maybe... [phone rings] Hold on. Timoney. The real reason that Rick and Molly Patterson took this trip is 'cause they got a suitcase full of pain pills that they were trying to sell. Oxycodone. Huh, but it wasn't in the hotel room. Right, but they never hooked up with the guy they were trying to sell it to. And where'd they get it? Sounds like they brought it with them. You guys tell us. All righty. Get this. The Pattersons had a suitcase filled with pills they were gonna sell. Oxy. The guy they were gonna sell them to, they ner hooked up with, and we don't have a suitcase. Didn't the aunt say that Molly was the cashier at the pharmacy? Huh. Can't be that easy, can it? You get a ride with the sheriff. I need the car. What? Why, what for? Because before I try to talk to Amanda about how her parents were drug dealers, I need to go get you and I a couple of motel rooms because obviously we're gonna be sticking around for a while. Don't you wish you had packed a bag now? Come on. Thank you. What are you, a giraffe? Hey, I have that seat right how I like it. If you move it, you better know how to move it back. I'm serious. You better know how to move it back. [Grumbles] Man, short people. They don't need to be next to each other, all right? They don't even need to be clean. They just need to be not the same room. Okay, well, one of them has two twins instead of a king size. And the other one doesn't have a fridge. Okay, I don't really care. Can I just pay you, please? Here you go. Okay. Check out time... noon. Pool closes at 11:00 P.M. Pool, you say? Around back. I know someone who will like that. [Water splashes] [Both laugh] I always wanted to go swimming when I was a kid. My dad used to take me to this place, Jones beach, in the summer sometimes. And one year, there were these jellyfish everywhere. They were like those see-through kind. You'd get out of the water and they'd be draped all over you, and sting you and it was really gross. You know how to hold your breath? Competition? I'm really good at it. On the count of three, ready? One. Yeah? One, two... Three. [Spits water] You won. Guess I'm not that... why did that happen? To my mom and dad? Why was it them? I don't know. He left the room door open. The man. When he came out after... I didn't want him to see me. And then he went down the stairs. And then I went in. [Cries] It's okay, buddy. You're all right. - [Whimpers] - You're all right. [Indistinct television chatter] Can she describe him? She's pretty vague. How vague? "A guy walked out of the room" vague. That is not a lot. Well, she literally just started talking again. So I'm trying not to jinx it. What about you guys? Well we got a partial print. Trying to match it, but right now that's all we got. We got nothing. It's cold here. Siberia. Well, we all better try to do better. Because I'm not telling this kid that we choked it. Okay? All right. Bye. I don't know. I have no clue how she got those pills. Uh, I barely even talked to h... Andy, come on. You know something. Now you gotta talk to this guy. So this dead woman, your employee, gets her hands on a grunt load of oxy and you have no idea how that could have happened. - Andy. - What? Look, stop trying to make this guy think you're a hardass, all right? This is how it sits, okay? Either you and the pattersons were dealing oxy together and you're wetting yourself 'cause you're about to be in big trouble. Or, Molly Patterson stole the oxy from you. And then I have to wonder why you didn't call the cops. I couldn't. I couldn't report the pills stolen because I... I'm not supposed to have them. And there it is. Please continue. I'm only allowed a certain amount of oxycodone a month. But I got people in pain. What am I supposed to tell them? "Too bad, suffer"? So you bought a suitcacase full of pills from someone. Who? Well they bring them down from Canada. The uh, off the books. I-I-I dropped the money off, I-I picked up the pills, I didn't see anybody. I didn't kill anybody. Who brought them down from Canada? [Sighs] Mark Morgan. Mark? "Mark"? You know the guy? Yeah, he's on my radar. I'm not surprised he's the one. I'm surprised you didn't think this was worth your while telling me till just now. Or am I? Am I surprised? No, never mind. Let's go. You ever actually arrest anyone up here, or are you mostly writing parking tickets? I'm sorry, that's not fair. You also do foreclosures. - Listen, slick... - Yes, gilligan? - It's only me, my deputy, and three part-timers. Takes the staties almost an hour to get here, if they feel like it. I do my best to lock down this town, okay? And when I have to pull strings to expedite phone records for some obnoxious out-of-towner's case, I do my best at that too. Thank you, sheriff. Now, are you two going to be able to work on the drug-running suspect together while I check out these phone records and wait for Amanda's aunt Peggy to come, or no? Tell me now. Thank you for the entertainment. It's not like we got an option. [Radio chatter] [Birds chirping] How you doing? Mr. Morgan, right? Detective Duffy, N.Y.P.D. This is sheriff Lawson. I'm sure you've met. Uh, we just wanted to talk about a few... Nope. Nope. You don't wanna know what about? Because two people were murdered. Rick and Molly Patterson. This is a small town. I know you probably know them. Do you? They were killed down in New York City with a big, huge knife. And something about a lot of oxycodone. Now I know you know about that. You need to get out of here, okay? You and him, get back in your car, and get off my land. Wait. We seem to have started off on the wrong foot here. Let's try again. How you doing? This is not a knife. This is a Glock 19. And this... Is a camera. Say "cheese." [Cell phone beeps] [Indistinct television chatter] Hey. Amanda. I'm gonna show you a picture right now, all right? I don't want you to think about anything except if it looks familiar, all right? Okay, here. No? Are you sure? Okay. [Cell phone beeps] Thanks for your time. So should we stop him? What if he's taking off? Amanda says it's not him. [Car starts] So we're not gonna do anything? He's your drug trafficker, not our murderer. So if something needs to be done, it needs to be done by you. [Growls playfully] Hold on. Be right back. I picked Amanda up some ice cream. It's got bubble gum in it. That's the kind my kids used to like. Very nice of you. Aunt Peggy not here yet? No, she's still at work, and she needs to pick her kids up on the way here. And Amanda's absolutely sure Mark Morgan wasn't the guy? - Sh-she's never seen him before. And I-I was watching her... Her face, her eyes, nothing. Call logs give you anything? Yeah, a headache. Otherwise, no. Man. That partial better turn out to be something. If that kid eats ice cream after all the chips and candy I crammed in her today, I'm gonna take her to coney island and enter her in a hot dog eating con... [Gunshots] Ah! What the hell's going on? - [Whimpering] - She's been hit! Oh, God, buddy. - How bad? - Bad! [Panting] Sheriff, hit the lights! Ah! Put that... [Gunshots] He's got us pinned in. Call 911! Duffy, my gun! It's in the top drawer. You're all right. We're moving you. Stay awake for me. Sally! There's a situation at the starbright. - What's your favorite subject? - Math. I gotta get all the guys and I gotta get the staties here. We're getting shot at! [Gunshots] No, I'm not kidding! Get over here, sheriff. Let me see if we can get out the back. [Panting] Oh, God. Duffy, grab me a towel, it's bleeding through. [Gunshots] Here. Hold this. We're going out the back window. - What? It's too small. - Well, not for me, it's not. And we're not moving her until it's safe. Then what? What are you gonna do? I'm gonna flank him to get his attention off this damn room! Sheriff, get over here! Get down. All right, Amanda. Hold on there. Oh. Ow. I get there, I yell, you cover me. Got it? I got it. Hey. Don't be stupid. Whatever. - [Breathing heavily] - There you go, breathe. [Gunshot] Duffy! [Gunshots] [Gunshots] [Panting] [Footsteps] [Gunshots] [Panting] Mark Morgan. [Sighs] You okay? Fine. How's she? [Sirens wailing] Bullet wound to the side, I need all hands on deck. Everybody with the day off has gotta come in, Lisa, do you hear me? Heavenly dove with light and comfort from above. What are you saying? - Oh, nothing. - [Groans] It's something that dad used to say to me when I was a litt girl. It's okay. Gracious spirit, heavenly dove with light and comfort from above. Be our guardian, you our guide. Stay close by this sweet child's side. - We got you. - It's all right, buddy. Go. Keep your eyes open. It's gonna be all right. You hear me? It's gonna be all right. [Sighs] [Woman speaking over p.A.] Me too. It's the adrenaline. Here, sit. Hey. Whiskey, bourbon, whatever you got around here you're not supposed to. [Sighs] So the shooter you nailed... There's no way he's our doer? Amanda said no, and we believe her. You're sure? Yeah. And Morgan had an alibi. And the pharmacist, whittaker, does too, so... Why was Morgan trying to kill our girl then? Morgan's muling oxy from Canada, supplying it to the pharmacist who sells it all over town. So if it's not them, there must be a third guy, an accomplice. The one that Amanda saw, the one that doesn't want her talking, so... Hold on. What? Uh, just, uh, everyone I've got is on their way. We got the state troopers en route too. Uh, lo, I-I was thinking that, uh, maybe we could go tear apart Morgan's place. Maybe we could find something that would help us... Would help you. Yeah. This. [Thunder booming] Hey. So where are you guys? We're waiting on a match for the, uh, bloody partial print. They're gonna tell us in the morning. Oh, yeah? I'll tell them something different. Get me the name and number of who you talked to. Jane, are you at the hospital now? Uh, yeah. Amanda's in surgery, her aunt was terrified, and she wouldn't leave her other kids. And you heard Duffy went to toss Morgan's place. No one else is here, so... I wanna be here, I guess. Are you okay? I'm good. [Door creaks open] I hate it up here. Did I tell you that? How is she? Uh, don't know yet. State troopers are on the way. Yeah, Lawson told us already. Thanks. What the hell are you doing with that thing anyway? Sheriff's orders. You know what? If you don't mind me saying... Your boss is kind of the king of too little too late. Hey, how is she? Through and through, it looks like. Don't think it even nicked anything on the way, but we're gonna take her down to x-rays, make sure we're not missing anything. She gave you a real good scare. Yeah. Hey, buddy. We'll go with you, okay? Radiation's in the basement of the South wing. Hope you got your hiking boots on. How you doing there, Roy? Good, Nance. [Cell phone rings] - Yeah. - Yeah, we got a match on your bloody print off the hotel door knob. Only it's not off a criminal record... A hit came back. Otreego county employee database. Ready for this? Deputy Roy green. Come on, Jane. Come on. - What? What is it? - Shut up, shut up! Spooky, huh? Yeah, there used to be 90,000 people in the tri-county area. Now there's, what? 40? Since the financial cutbacks, this place has been slowly falling apart. Hello there, you've reached Jane timoney. Leave a message, please... [Sighs] Jane. Pick up, Jane! Pick up, pick up! Son of a bitch. - How you doing there, buddy? - Good. Soon as we get out of here, I'm gonna get you such a big Shirley temple with those huge maraschino cherries. You like them? I don't like them much. Taste like chemicals and stuff. Know what I mean? [Thunder booming] [Elevator bell dings] Just down in the basement. All aboard. [Elevator bell dings] What are you doing? He's the guy who killed Amanda's parents. What... Roy is? Yes, listen to me, Nancy. No, listen to me. I'm clocking out of here, all right, in half an hour, and my family... look, I got nothing to do with this. Whatever this is, I got nothing to do with it. I understand, Nancy. Calm down, okay? Just stay right here. [Whispers] Hold on, okay? W-w-wait. [Panting] Okay, can you pick her up? 'Cause I can't shoot and pick her up at the same time. Please. It's going to be all right. Nancy knows the way out, don't you? Keep... just... Put your arms around here. Okay, I've gotou. Okay, which way? - This way. - This way? Hold on. Okay. [Elevator bell rings] That's it, that's it, that's it. Oh, help me, God, oh, my God. Okay, it's okay. [Loud footsteps] [Gasps] Okay, let's go. This way. - Where? - Right down here. Right here, right here. Okay. Right here, right here. Okay. [Panting] My God. [Gasps] - It's okay. - Shh. It's okay. [Softly sobbing] Okay. Is there another exit? There's an emergency exit down the hall. Yeah, let's go. Come on. [Whispers] Let's go. He's here. Let's go. Hurry. [Groaning] [Whimpering] They kept saying they were going to put a lock on the door to keep kids from coming up here to get drunk. So where is there... Okay! So where is there another way out? Back to where we came from. [Whispering] You're kidding me. Look, I didn't make this place, all right? We want out, we gotta go back. Okay, ready? Go. Yes, you can, come on. No, I can't. Yes, you can! Keep going. I wasn't even scheduled to work today, you know that? I'm just covering for that bitch Lisa. Know how to use this? I'm from Newark. Good girl. Shoot at anything that moves, all right? Except for me and her. Come on, buddy. Come on. All right. [Grunts] [Snaps fingers] Give me your phone. Give me your phone. Go ahead. Stay! Hey, listen, some people come back, and I'm one of them. Okay? Okay. [Floor creaks] [Muffled crying] [Cell phone rings] [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshots] Don't shoot. It's over. Okay, it's over. I really need to start exercising. Okay, okay. All right. Okay, buddy. All right. Let's go get that X-ray. Okay. Your deputy... It was all his operation. Me and mark just worked for him. Yeah, all I did was be their front. Roy said if I didn't help, then he'd report me to the D.E.A. For doing it anyway, and that I'd go to jail. I could listen to this all day. How about you, Duff? Naive, small town, "what wait, who, me?" I love it. Get him out of here. Listen, uh... I'm really sorry about all of this. Sorry, huh? You've any idea the paperwork we're in for? Not to mention the firearms discharge review. Don't forget the grand jury inquiry. And the psych eval. Those are fun, reg. Yeah, so... Sorry's not cutting it, sheriff. All right, well... Any time you two want to leave is fine with me. Ew. Are you leaving? Are you trying to get rid of me? Hmm, not this second. But soon. You know what, you were an awfully brave girl last night. And that's a good thing, 'cause you're going to have to keep doing that, okay? Guess what? What? I didn't tell you this before, but um, my mom died too, when I was just a little older than you. And gosh, I was mad. And I missed her, and then, some days I completely forgot about her, and that really made me feel awful. And when I felt awful, I felt mad again. So... There's no right to feel about something this terrible happening. Okay? The right way is however you feel. You know, like now, I feel sad. I feel a little sad. [Sniffles] 'Cause I don't like many people. Especially little people. [Laughs] But I like you. I like you a lot. I like you too. [Sniffles] I don't know why. [Chuckles] You know what? I am not going to get up here very often, even tugh it's been so much fun, and there's so much to do... [Sniffles] But here's my card. See, there's my phone number? See that there? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. You call me any time. I'll always answer. Okay? Okay. [Sniffles] Okay. Can I call you tonight? I wish you would. See you, buddy. Hey. How you doing, sweetie? [Sighs] My first foot post was in east Harlem. I got 20 something years on the job, shot people, but I never killed no one. I leave the city for one day, two bodies. Yeah, and if we don't leave here right now, there's going to be a lot more. I'll tell you that. - I'll shoot every leaf-crapping tree in this place if I could. Let's get the hell home, right? I'm gonna drive so fast, the transmission's gonna explode, which will not make me stop. Nope, don't stop. Don't even slow down when we reach my apartment. I'll just roll out. I'll be fine. Better than here. I like your shirt, by the way. Yeah. Souvenir. By Mikhel for Subtitulos.es ==SPREAD THE WORD==
