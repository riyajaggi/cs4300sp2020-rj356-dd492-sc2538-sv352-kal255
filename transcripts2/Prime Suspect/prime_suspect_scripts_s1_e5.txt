 We wanna know if it's her. Miss, please step back and lower your voice. Yeah, you wouldn't help us look when she was missing, but you're here now, huh? Guess what. You don't listen, so I don't listen! Tell us if it's Marta! Your old neighborhood doesn't seem too happy to have us here, Ev. It's not a happy occasion, is it? Where's the body?

 Off a path a couple of acres inside. Park manager says if it hadn't been raining the last couple of days, runners probably would've found her earlier, but... Look at this. Where's the justice? Where's the justice? Look who's here. The man, the myth-- Ron O’Brien, Mr. Access himself. "Well, you see, as a former homicide detective..." "Before I whored my meager talent..." Hey, Ron, how you doin'? Janie. - How are you? - Hey, what's this?

 What, are you tryin' to stop smokin'? You got a problem with that? It helps. Anything you can tell me? If it's tellable, you know I'll tell you. Good to see you, brother. - Bye. - See you. I'm gonna suss out the crowd and see who's in the mood to be helpful. This gentleman here-- this is the park manager. How you doin'? - He'll take you to the scene. - Great. Uh, I can take one up front or one in the flatbed. Or two up front, if you don't mind being uncomfortable. No problem. I'll walk. Throat cut ear to ear, but strangled, too. Guess we're looking for a guy who wears a belt and suspenders. What's up with the flowers? Lilies, tulips... Probably fresh, what, a week? Where'd they come from this time of year? Somebody went to all this trouble to make this gesture, but then they pose her naked, spread out in the open. Humiliation. But how's that jive with the, uh, flowers? Here's a thought. Maybe the killer is a nut job. Detectives... They want you guys back at the south entrance, like, now. Where were you guys a week ago, huh? You all did nothing! Hey. Hey. Let him see her! Take me to my daughter! Wait, wait, wait, we don't have a positive I.D. on her yet. He's her father! Let him see what you let happen! No one's goin' in there, okay? So turn that mouth of yours around, and tell your friends and neighbors to go home! Take me to my daughter! Hey, look-- Hey, sir! Hey, sir! Hey, hey, hey! You gonna make me cuff you? I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him! You cuff me, you're gonna get torn to pieces! Yeah, you think? I got him, I got him, I got him! Oh, come on! You got to be kidding me! I don't want to, but I'll do it if you make me, papi. Don't think that I won't. - Is that a tomato? - Who threw that? Where do you get a tomato in the middle of November? Hey! Will you tell her to take that tree out of my face? What'd she say? She put a curse on you. Oh, great. And I don't feel so good myself either! Hey! Hey, stop! Hey, listen, for the la-- Hey, listen, I'm gonna tell you for the last time... We are here to help you! Back up! ♪ Prime Suspect 1x05 ♪ Regrets, I've Had a Few Original Air Date on October 27, 2011 re-sync by elderman corrected by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com Massive blood loss. What was her throat cut with? Not a real sharp thing. - Definitely serrated. - Right. Plus, the bruises on her neck indicate that she was strangled while she still had blood in her... - Mm-hmm. - As far as the order of events. Right. Oh, by the way, her vocal cords were hacked out. - No. - That's probably somethin'. That's disgusting is what it is. I'll say. Is Metcalf here, or can you take me a picture of that? Yay. I never get to take the picture. Just don't get from the chin down. - Like, a little... - Okay. I mean, she's so pretty. Beautiful. Was she having problems with anybody that you know of? Everybody loved her. Boyfriend? No. Did you find her ring? Ring? A moonstone-- like, a shimmery blue. Junot gave it to her. I know he's gonna want it. No, we didn't find anything like that. I'm sorry. Where is Mister, um, Suroz? Is he gonna meet you down here or-- No, he can't. It's too much for him. Well, it's a pretty hard thing to make you do all on your own. He is not an easy man. He doesn't have God in his heart. He don't believe that Martita's in heaven. He's just angry. Yeah. I really need to speak to him, though, okay? So here's my card. Last night, I went to do the laundry... Yeah? And the basket was, like, her dad's socks and whatever, and... And the rest was just her stuff. I'll get you a ride home, okay? There's attention on you now is why you care. When the camera's all in your face, you care. I'm not gonna argue with you, all right? I'm gonna ask-- if you know somethin' about what happened to your friend, - you should tell us. - Why? You don't do anything. You're not gonna do anything. But I thought you said we would, now. We'll do somethin' now, because people are watchin' us. Is that not what you said? Because where were you when she was missing, huh? Probably investigating someone's death. Okay, that's it. That is it. We got to go, okay? Now, you don't think we care, fine. You care! So speak up! I knew somethin' could catch who killed my friend, I... I'd be tellin' it on a mountain. Now, we know you don't like us, and we know you're angry. But is that all there is to know here... Or not? The LTDs... La Tropa Domo... Beat down some guy who burned them, put him in a coma, a month ago, about. Marta came out the back of the restaurant and saw it happen. She report it? She said she would, but maybe the LTDs did something first. She tell anybody else? She said only me, but... Her stepdad, probably. She told him everything. Mr. Suroz is her stepfather? It means he's not really her dad. Yeah, okay. Thank you. You're welcome... Mr. Tomato Head. La Tropa Domo runs that neighborhood. If they wanted her dead, she would be dead. But to leave her naked and posed like that, with flowers... That's unlike anything I've ever heard them do. Or... Or what, the stepdad? Makes a big show at the park, then doesn't come in to I.D. the body. No one knows his current whereabouts, and she was young and good-looking... And the stepkids are, like, 60% more likely to be murdered than the real kind. Called the... "thingy effect." The... "Cinderella effect." Well, huh. Goodness gracious, it reads, huh? Oh... You all right? - Yeah. Yeah. - You all right, over there? What? 'Cause of the curse? Shut up. Come on. We need to sweep the park, round up all the LTDs. Mm-hmm. After we find step-papi. Yeah, both. You guys take, uh, Mr. Suroz, and I'll do the park sweep. Of course. Maybe your buddy Mr. O’Brien can put you on the 6:00 news. You should ask Sweeney for a stylist. You had all that time to think of a slammer, that's the best you got? Wow. A lot of boots on the ground you're askin' for. It's a lot of park. You sure about this? Well, I was only about half sure until you signed off on it. Now I'm all in. You know why I signed off. So you can get these phones to stop ringin'. - Catchin' a lot of flak, huh? - Yeah. Take that manpower I gave you, and put this thing to bed already. - I'm gettin' a cauliflower ear. - Thank you, sir. Lieutenant Sweeney. What time were you thinkin'? You tell me. - 8:15. - Okay. 8:15, Friday. Mm-hmm, okay. This Friday. I got it! Got it here... Got it here... And... Got it here. Your 45th anniversary. What is that-- sapphire or ruby? You got that from her, you know. The writin' yourself messages on the back of your hand. No, I didn't. I got it from Aunt Rosie. Aunt Rosie got it from your mom. She would've been so proud of you, Janie. Well, she was. She was, always. But if she could see the way you turned out... Ugh... How I am so strong, denying you cigarettes on your 45th wedding anniversary? I am on a straight and narrow path, so... Just the way your mom would've wanted. Yeah, for everybody but her. Hold on. Timoney. What? - You're pulling my men? - Your men? My men. We have to prioritize. We got a NYU girl that's been missing-- - Pretty, rich, white... - Aw, come on. So that's why you're killing the park sweep? So I should just stand down till when? - Till my case is unsolvable? - You got a girl that's dead. We got a girl might still be alive and a finite number of guys. You are making their point for them. - You couldn't do it better. - What point? When it's a missing brown girl from a nobody family, it's an afterthought, whatever's left. You think I didn't bring that up? You think you're the first person pointed that out? And yet, here we are. - How you doin'? - Good. - Janelle! - Thank you. Janelle! Computer's frozen. Where's Timmy? Hello. What are you doin' here? Thank you. I had guys from detective bureau assigned to me first, but then I lost 'em to the missing NYU girl. How many guys? Ten. What are you lookin' for in the park? Everything. Janie, it's not like I can't find out if I want to. As long as you don't find out by me, that's okay. Now, I don't believe that's entirely true. Your hair looks great. My hair is exactly the same. Which is why I like it so much. I heard that you're dating a civilian-- living with a civilian, actually. What's that all about? What is that, Jane? I mean, these little birdies, they whisper things in my ear. When they're about you, I listen extra hard. Shoot me. I'm gonna let your wife do that. I'll tell her you said so. Okay. How long has it been since you and I were in the same room face-to-face? I wanted it to be longer than this. I can get you three squads, one and five-- 3 sergeants, 15 patrolmen, 18 total, but you cannot have 'em all night. I'm not gonna need 'em all night, so... Well, I hope you're right. This is not what I was expectin', anyway. I don't know. It's on the desk. Me and Reg are gonna hit the family restaurant, try to get the mom to tell us where the stepdad is. I thought we were gettin' brown shoes for the sweep. These are black shoes. Brown shoes are all out looking for the missing NYU student, remember? That's pretty generous, pretty unlike Deputy Chief Costello. All I did was ask, all right? All right. Now, watch yourselves! 'Cause some of these guys are packin' out-of-season produce. So when was the last time you saw him? Yesterday. He usually just take off and not call you? This does not look good for him. You should just put that out there. I would, but I don't know where he went. Just know that he loved Marta. This is crushing him. Then how about you give us the names of whoever you think he might go to, and we go from there? Hey, folks, sorry about that. Comin' through. - Did you see the light? - What? You see it? The Padiddle. You see it? Let me answer that question with a question, sir... Can we talk about this, where it's warm, at the ... Who here likes pizza? Great. All you. Guys, round 'em up, please. What's this hell? It's anaconda stew. No, it's mangu. It's plantains, butter, some salt. It's good food. Nothin' in there will hurt you, Regis. Smells like foot. You'll eat it and like it. Gracias. - Okay. - Everybody. Next... Go ahead. Where's this kid goin'? What are you waiting for? What do you mean what am I waiting for? You're the human cheetah-- you're supposed to take him down while I narrate in a British accent. I pulled my hamstring last night, okay? Listen, it's all you. I got your back. Go get him. - Hey! - Go, go, go, go, go. Kid! Come on! You got to run faster than that! So, uh, I got you bruja. If that's a dessert, pass. Priestess-- friend of my mom's, right around the corner. - We could do it in half an hour. - Do what? - Lift the curse off you. - You're kiddin' me, right? This is no joke, Reg. Right, jokes are funny. Hey! Come-- Come here! Freeze! Drop the gun! You heard me! Drop the gun right n-- Drop it right now! Drop it! Drop that thing! Drop the gun! Drop it right now! Sanctuary! Sanctuary! Father, I need you to give me holy sanctuary. Put your hands up! I need you to give me holy sanctuary, father! Give me holy sanctuary, please! Okay. It's all right, everybody. It's all right. You can't do this, man! Look, I got sanctuary! Were the people in there wearing suits of armor, moron? Get off me, man! I didn't do nothin'! You can't do this! I didn't do anything, man! Uh, bag that. You're bleeding. You're bleeding. No, seriously. Your neck. Must've been the glass. You gonna see the brujo now? He missed. I'm not cursed. I'm blessed. I didn't shoot nobody, all right? - The gun just went off. - Uh-huh. That's all well and good, but looky here. You went up for assault and robbery. So that makes this attempted manslaughter. And with you being a predicate felon and all, that's gonna mean that you're lookin' at life, Ivan. Look, I didn't shoot nobody, all right? The gun just went off! Tell us about Marta, Ivan. Who? Marta Suroz. Hello? We heard she was gonna rat you guys out for putting some poor slob in a coma. Man, we didn't do none of that, all right? We do business. We're businessmen. That park like my company, all right? And nobody is droppin' bodies on company property. That's how it is. You're a clown, man. I'm a clown? You're a joke. Couldn't cut it, so you came down here, and they jumped you into the only lame-ass gang would have you. You talkin' to me, fool? I'm talkin' to you now. Life. Ivan, remember, life. She saw some people. I ain't sayin' who. She saw 'em beat down some pariguayo. And I'm not gonna lie, they wanted to kill her. But they got told no by someone they listened to. Little hellcat... I was gonna hit that. Ask my boys. I didn't say that. I am Auda Abu Tai. I carry 23 wounds, all got in battle. 75 men have I killed with my own hands. All right, listen to me! I'm gonna keep this simple. If you want pepperoni, raise your hand! The Turks pay me a golden treasure, yet I am poor, - for I... - I am a river to my people! Lawrence of Arabia. Come on. Greatest movie ever made. Everybody's gettin' pepperoni! - Did you find the Padiddle? - The what, now? The--the Padiddle in the woods. I-I told the other cops about it--did they find it? Sir, I am at a loss. But fear not. Though I cannot fiddle, from a tiny city can I make a great state. Huh? That wasn't you. Let me get you a soda. And wash my hands. - Do you have rights? - Yeah. - This guy has rights. - Timoney. Have a seat. They found her, the coed. That's great news. Yeah. In a hotel room with her boyfriend-- had no clue what the fuss was all about. Happy ending. So you might've had those guys I signed off on after all. Almost wouldn't even have had to wait for 'em. The search had to be done. Oh, it got done. You made sure about that. I guess a lot of squad commanders don't mind if you go around 'em. They think it shows initiative. They're... impressed, maybe even amused. But, see, that's, uh... That's nuts to me. But, hey... easier to ask for forgiveness than permission, right? I'm sorry for doing it. Okay. Well, good. Okay. Go ahead. Where are you with the stepfather? He's got a cousin he's pretty tight with down in Brooklyn. Me and Reg are gonna go out in a few. What, you get bit by a vampire, Reg? We got a leak now. I wonder who that might be. Sources within the department say investigators are focusing on the whereabouts of the murdered girl's stepfather, Junot Suroz. 23-year-old Marta Suroz was murdered in Cloisters Park. Police are anxious to talk to Junot Suroz, who has been missing since soon after his stepdaughter's body was found. Hope you and Mr. O’Brien are proud of yourselves. Hey, he'd never do that to me, to us, to another cop. W-what'd he ever do that-- that you would say that? If it wasn't him, then who was it? Emotionally, psychologically, but not-- Hold on. I needed a favor-- I needed a favor... I got to call you back. I needed a favor. The park's a hot story again. And nothing I told her is untrue. Uh-huh. And now Suroz knows he's the suspect. Do you know how much back scratching you got to do, Jane? You get something to trade, you got to jump on it with both feet. Ew, this is seriously what you're gonna say to me. I don't make the rules of the world, okay? At least act as if you've been here before. Maybe the only time I've ever been to this part of the world is with you. How do you live in the East Village? What you mean? How do you live in the East Village-- wall-to-wall hipsters? Unless you like that or somethin'. Well, hell, no, I don't like it. But I got rent control, and I like that. And if some damn fool in a newsboy cap wants to buy me out, fine. Until then, I'm listenin' to Milly Quezada with the windows wide open while I'm cleanin' my guns, right? You wearin' a vest? Ah, you are. I'll be damned. You wearin' a vest. You scared? - Suroz. - Oh, yeah. That's what I would be sayin', too. Distract me from tellin' everybody in this building-- Put my face on television? You think I killed my girl, huh? - Hey, hey! - I'm here! I am here! - You all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. So where have you been? It's private. Mr. Suroz, until we find out who killed Marta, nothing is private. I went to church... A lot of churches. Okay. She believed in God. I never did. She told me that's why she was never scared-- 'cause God was with her. So I went to ask God to please come into me. I went everywhere that God gonna be. But I didn't feel nothin'. Okay, I'm gonna tell you somethin'. Between you and me... your stepdaughter is dead. Your wife needs you, and you disappear. Now, I have seen a lot of people deal with this kind of thing, but they don't react like you. - What they do? - Well, for starters, they cry. And when they don't, it usually means there's something behind it. They feel more than me... 'Cause I don't cry? Tears make you innocent? Marta's dad... He left Emilia, my wife, when she was pregnant, went to Florida. She had the baby, and then... like, five month later, she went dancin', and she met me. And the first word Marta said was my name. You want tears? I got tears. - Hey, hey, hey! - I got tears! I got tears! I got tears! I got tears! - Hey, hey, hey... - It's okay. It's okay. - It's okay. It's okay. - I got tears. It's okay. Sorry to keep you waiting. Did--did they bury her? The girl? No, they haven't. Well, she needs a proper burial. Let's agree to agree on that. Let me ask you... Do you know anything about the flowers at your campsite? Maybe whose they were, where they came from... You okay? The--the flowers are the way it should be. How what should be? Well, it wasn't right. People seein' her like that-- wasn't right. Like how? Like, naked? Thrown out like garbage. Did you kill that girl, Duke? No. But you covered her body with the flowers? - You want a drink? - Yeah. Yeah. Lieutenant, I need a bottle for a homeless guy with the D.T.s, and maybe some information. There are serious penalties for alcohol in a department facility. Huh. Try the cupboard under the break room sink. Yeah, I had a little girl once. I still do, I think. She might be in St. Louis now. You wouldn't want your-- your little girl to be lyin' there like that for other people to look at. You'd want to cover her up. With, um... with flowers. Uh, fresh flowers. Why do churches throw away fresh flowers? I don't know. Um, so, when you found her, how long do you think she'd been there? Oh, I don't know. I saw the Padiddle at night. And the next morning, that's when I saw her. - The "Padiddle-whata"? - "Padiddle." It's a light in the dark, moves around. Sometimes it's slow, and sometimes it's fast. - It's white. - Right. White, white. Okay, I, uh, think you have this under control, Augie, so I'm just gonna leave you two to it. - Hey. - Hey. You know that guy, uh, Lyons, the park manager? Yeah. He is the only full-time city employee. But in the summers, they hire part-timers-- clean up after the picnics and whatnot. Well, that's not nothin'. Can this guy Lyons get us a contact list of all the part-timers? I don't know. Maybe you should go up there and ask him. Fine. You coming? Uh, I think I should stay with Reg, in case there's a meteor shower... Or a plague of bugs... - Some such... - What? That's what you get for being so helpful, right? Now we're not gonna leave you alone. Oh, it's--it's fine. Uh, I keep most of the info on part-time employees - in the computer. - There. Uh, there's just gates that I have to lock after sunset. - You mind waiting? - Um... Or you could come along. We've had a couple of reports of, uh, coyote sightings. - Maybe we spot one. - Uh-huh. What? You want to put him under oath? A Bible in one hand, a bottle in the other. To say what? That he interfered with a crime scene? I'm just sayin' I think the guy knows somethin', you know? He just can't ar-- you know, articulate it. What would you know? I light a match in front of your mouth, the building would explode. You try keepin' up with a guy that drinks to stay warm. See how you like it. You okay there? I am dandy. Oh, yeah? I can see that. Yes, you can. Okay, all right. What's the story here? The gang sweep's a bust, and so are the homeless. It's the stepdad or nothin'. Don't forget the Padiddle, whatever the heck that is. Padiddle? When one headlight is out on a car, - the car is called a "Padiddle." - What? You never sat on the stoop countin' Padiddles? You go, "Padiddle!" - Then you smack the other kid. - Ow! No! We call it "punch buggy," and it's when you see a V.W. bug! - "Slug bug." - Right. Yeah, well, I don't know what neighborhood you grew up in. You wanted to know what a Padiddle is--that's what it is. That's what it is. A car with one headlight. You happy now? I tell ya, I'd be happier if I had some nachos. Hey... You got a headlight out. You know that? Yeah, I got to buy a bulb. You gonna give me a citation? I'm a homicide detective, not a traffic cop. As long as you can see, I don't care. Let's go find the coyote. Alright. It's a beautiful tree. It was actually a-a gift from the city of Tokyo. Huh. - Oh, so, that part-time list. - You want me to print it out? Yeah. Please Print it out. Yep. Hey, Lyons is giving us the list of the names of all of the part-time park employees. - Yeah? - How'd Blando make out? The hobo's not the killer. Okay? Oh, really? Oh, we didn't know that. I wondered if we knew anything new. Nothin' important. We know that "Padiddle" is a game where you get to punch your buddy if you see a car with only one headlight. Lyons' truck has a headlight out. What? What? What? He brings Marta's body to the dump site in the truck, okay? "A floating, white light left the body," the hobo says? Right? Lyons's truck has-- has one headlight out. Wait, wait-- this is Sweeney here. We're gonna need more than a hobo and a Padiddle for the D.A. Uh-huh, you think? If he took Marta in this truck, it's a crime scene. We search it, we find something, we can arrest him. Listen to me. Reg and them are on the way. Can you keep Lyons busy? And they'll search the truck. Can you do that? Yep. Turns out we don't need that list from you after all. No? Okay. Well... Um... I mean, you probably can't tell me. But I guess that that's good that-- that you don't need it? Understand... that this is only because you've been so helpful, but you got to keep this to yourself. - Yeah. No, no, of--of course. - All right? We are about to make an arrest... the stepfather. Wow. Right? So, he, like-- he, like, killed his own daughter-- or stepdaughter, whatever? Well, once this is over, I can get more into the intricacies of it with you. But all I can say right now is it's bizarre. Hey. Dibs on bein' the one that gets to tell this guy that a tarp is not a reasonable expectation of privacy. Dibs on doin' this. Shh. Oh! If I was lookin' to cut a girl's voice box out with something... I guess I could start with one of these. So, the deal with the flowers... You don't know why he put those out? Yeah. No, we don't know why he did that. Ah. Wow. Good for you, you know, for... Hey, hey, hey! This is my neighborhood. These are my people. If I was a different man, I'd give you to them. Get up. Let me see your hands. Come on! You all right? What are those? Clown panties? Nice. You ready to see the brujo now? - Yeah. - Thought so. Blood Duffy found in the car-- it's hers. And the saw? Clean. But Ira said the, uh, teeth match the wounds. - Hey. - All right. Word came down from his office just after you brought him in. Figured I'd get a jump on it. - I found that. - Hmm. Wow. Does that look shimmery blue to you? I don't know if it's blue, but it's a moonstone. Good job. Whose are those? Four other pieces of jewelery that don't belong to Marta Suroz. You been workin' at Cloister Park since, uh, '98. Five missing girls-- never solved, no bodies found. They're maybe just the ones that had people to miss 'em. Did you cut out all their vocal cords or just Marta's? Why'd you want her found and not the others? She was a brave girl. She had faith. Maybe that's what made her brave, but she was too brave for you, wasn't she? That's why you cut out her voice and made sure the world found a naked slut. Their families cared. Didn't seem like anybody else did, though. I don't blame you for thinkin' that. But it's not true anymore. Just so you know... Even if we do it to cover our own asses, we care now. We care a lot. I'm Casey Rosenfeld, sir, from the office of the public defender. First thing that's gonna happen is they're gonna take you down to book you, and I'm gonna be with you for that, so we need-- I got a heart condition, okay? So someone needs to get my prescription. This isn't over. Ah. That's a blessing. You're gonna want to be grateful for that. Come on. See you later. Timoney. Do I hear the lonely echo of the squad room? What? - You workin' late? - Um, it's not so late. Yeah, I know you. I know when your shift is over. And it's over. It's dark out. So why are you still there? So, what, you think we're gonna do this now, just because I had to come to you and ask for something important? Did you? Yeah, how--how was I gonna get the manpower? Did you have to do it? So--so, your guy... He's--he's a good guy, as far as you can tell? What's his name, Brad? Chip? Toastrack? You know what? Stop. I got to go. - Not yet you don't. - I got to go. Yeah, I know. I understand. You got to hang out a little longer, keep working, right? That way, maybe there's a little chance that he's asleep when you get home, right? You know what? That's not why. Your mom's favorite scene in any movie ever-- Riddle me that. Jimmy Cagney and the grapefruit. My favorite scene in any movie ever. Jimmy Cagney-- "I'm on top of the world, Ma!" Ah, you're too good. Yeah. Janie, there's no harm in lookin'... in remembering a time when... the mere act of applying this to that had no consequences whatsoever. That time never existed, Pop. Does it count if we just light it... and enjoy the smoke at a distance? Everything counts. Happy Anniversary. Here's to everlasting love. Oh, yeah. Mm. re-sync by elderman corrected by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com
