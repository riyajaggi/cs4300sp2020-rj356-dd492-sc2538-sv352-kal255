 [ominous music playing] [device beeping] - I can't move from my neck down. - It's going to be okay. [whispers] I... Hey. - [Chase] I can't move my body. I can't... - [nurse] Yes, you can. - I can't move from my neck down. - That's just... - I'm paralyzed. - No, you're not. I promise you're not. [whimpers] [panting] Look at me. You're not even looking at me. Hello.

 I'm looking right at you, and I'm telling you there is nothing at all wrong with you. [Chase winces] [nurse] See? [Chase whimpers] [Chase grunts in pain] [Chase] Ow! [sighs] If you were paralyzed, there's no way you could feel that. Wh... What is that? [groans] It feels like ice in my veins. [grunts] It tastes like metal. Just some antibiotics.

 [whispering] How did I... [panting] I was on an island. How did I get here? [device beeping] Wait. Wait. [faintly] What did you just give me? [distorted droning sound] [sound of waves lapping] [gasps] [man] How do you feel now? A little better, I hope. All your vitals say that you're doing well. Who are you? I'm Dr. Conrad. I'm watching over you while you're here. [breathes heavily] Where is "here"? I'm sure you have lots of things you wanna know about. - Yeah. - Questions... How did I get off the island? Someone will be speaking with you about that very shortly, I promise. Now, uh, someone else told me that you were screaming about being paralyzed or something like that. Yes. I can't move, from the neck down. I can't even move my fingers. [powering down sound] [device beeping] What the hell did you just do? How did you do that? Sorry. The nurse should've explained it to you. Um, it's a force field of sorts, which sounds very sci-fi, but it's really just, uh, magnetics. That's all. A magnetic force field to keep you in place. It's for your own safety, really. - And, uh... - And what? Also required, uh... for anyone in the prison population. No, wait, wait, I'm so... The prison? People, uh, will see you very soon. Wait! No, please, don't leave! Hold on! Please! Hey! Let me out of here! Open the door! Come on, I just want to talk to you! [panting] Hello? [theme music playing] [bell chimes] - Come with us, please. - [Chase] Where are we going? Get up. - Jesus. It was only a question. - Nice and slow. [chuckles] Relax. I was just standing up. [bell chimes] [indistinct female voice speaks over loudspeaker] [suspenseful music playing] [indistinct radio chatter] [indistinct male voice speaks over loudspeaker] [door closes] Hard to believe somebody like you could cause so much damn trouble. I'm small, but I'm mighty. [man chuckles] That's good. "Small but mighty." You come up with that? My mother did. Actually, I... I think... she did. That just popped into my head. I don't know if it was my mother or another woman who told me that when I was a kid. Hmm. Well, I like it. It suits you. Small but mighty. 'Course, I think all that military training you got probably has something to do with it, too, I figure. Anyhoo. How you feeling? Doctors all seem to think you're doing okay. What they're saying. But I wanted to see you and ask you for myself 'cause this has never happened before, in all our testing. Somebody like you, waking up like this. 'Course, the whole damn thing's brand-new, anyways. So, how are you? - Doing just fine, sir. - Oh, please don't do that. Don't call me "sir." Warden is fine, or Warden Wells. Doing fine, Warden. I mean, other than the fact that I have no idea what the fuck's going on here, guess you could say I'm doing just dandy. [laughs] Terse but honest, huh? Is that it? I like that. I like that a lot. You want a drink? I need one. Oh, but you're probably not supposed to have any, are you? So I'll just drink alone. Not a problem at all. [Chase sighs] [Warden whistles] [Warden continues whistling] Yessiree Bob. That's a great fuckin' sound, you know that? On the rocks? I love that. [Warden clicks tongue] So, young lady, you might wanna turn your chair around so we can talk proper. Can you do that for me? [loud dragging noise] Great. That's perfect. You're concerned. Got some questions. Makes total sense. So, go ahead, ask me anything. I'm not kidding. This is the time. All right. Why am I here? I mean, like, why am I in prison? What have I supposedly done? That's the big one for you? "Why am I here?" I mean, we could probably spend a whole day on that one. But that's for other people to tell you, learned people, who you'll be spending quality time with tomorrow. [inhales deeply] But right now, between you and me, aren't you really more interested in that island? Hmm? What all that shit was about? Those first few minutes there on the beach... must've been a real mindfuck. - Yeah, pretty much. - Well, good. It was supposed to be. Disorienting, off-putting. It was designed to be that way. What is that supposed to mean? [sighs] You don't get it, do you? Even now. - No, I guess not. I don't... - You weren't... really there. It was a simulation. One of those virtual deals that a bunch of geeks came up with on their fucking iPads. Wait, what? All that weird shit, the "find your way back" sign, the bunch of crap buried in the sand, did that seem normal to you? Hmm? No. No, I guess not, now that I think of it. You were there on that island, but in your mind. You and nine other people, all prisoners here at this facility, all given a chance to go to that island to see how they would fare if they had a second chance, so to speak. A do-over. I know, it's... it sounds fucking crazy, - but it's the absolute... - No. No, it's not possible. I assure you, it is. No, I'm not crazy. I know I was on an island. It was real. I was there. Anyhoo, I get it. I understand. This is probably a fucking shit show in your head right now. I mean, how could it not be? Sounds like the goddamn Twilight Zone or something, no doubt, but it's the truth. The absolute, complete, goddamn truth, and I will swear that on a stack of Bibles for you. - It just... It felt so real. - I'm not saying it didn't happen, that you couldn't feel pain, or people can't die, because they can. But it was still all in your head, okay? Do you comprende? [sighs] I hope you mean that. 'Cause once we're all through here, and that means physically, psychologically, all that shit, they're hoping to send you back inside. So get ready. [suspenseful music plays] [nurse] Time for bed. - I hope that's not for me. - [nurse] It is, doctor's orders. For what? Please don't raise your voice with me. - I'm not raising my voice. - You're becoming agitated. - I'm just asking you a question. - It's a sleeping aid, that's all. I don't want it. - Guards. - You don't need to call them, I'm... - Put your hands down. - My hands are down. I'm just... - They're not. You're becoming aggressive. - I'm not becoming aggressive. - Guards, please. - Don't! [fighting grunts] - [groans] - [nurse] Please, stop. [beeping] [Chase pants] [Chase] Stay the fuck back! [alarm wailing] - Help me, please! - Shut up! - [nurse] Help me! - Don't move! - Back away! - Help me! Shut up! Back off! - Let the nurse go! - Back off! - Let the nurse go! - Back off! [gunfire] [panting] [Dr. Conrad] Hold your fire! Stop! [men yelling] [gunfire] - [Chase yelps] - [man grunts] [man groans] [panting] [yelps] [grunts] [wails] [grunts, whimpers] [man] She's here! [Chase grunts] [lock beeping] [female voice on loudspeaker] We are in full facility lockdown. I repeat, full facility lockdown. [gasps] [powering up noise] [breathes heavily] What the fuck? [gasps] [grunts] What the fuck? - Not so tough now, are you? - Get me down! Get me down from here! Wait! Wait! Where you going? Come back! - You guys can't do this! - [door slides shut] The fuck is this place?! [woman speaks indistinctly on loudspeaker] [man] All clear! [indistinct chatter] [sighs] [yelps, grunts] [panting] [groans] [scoffs] Meeting's downstairs. Sure you don't wanna take the shortcut? [snickers] [indistinct male voice over loudspeaker] Please be seated. I'm Dr. Stevenson. I'm one of the original neural architects of this simulation, - which simply means that... - When you say "simulation"... I mean, something that is simulated. A... A synthetic experience. - Okay. - She means that you are both inside of it and outside of it at the same time. Both yin and yang. [laughing] Jesus Christ. I thought I did a shitty job explaining things. - [laughs] - Warden, please. This is our time now. Go on. You were under sedation. More than that, really. A medical coma, to be completely honest and transparent. Your body, your physical self, was outside of the game, - but your mind... - [scoffs] It's not a game. Sorry. I didn't mean to say that. Please refrain from referring to it as a game, if you would. Don't lecture me, Professor. Okay, I get what you mean. Good. That's very good. [chuckles] I mean, it just... It felt so real. [stammers] It just seemed so completely... I can't wrap my head around the idea that it might not be. [sighs] I'm a sociologist. Dr. Dafoe. You might not remember, but that's not important. What is important is this. How did you feel you did out there? I'm not sure I understand your question. Poorly, in general? I'm alive. That's good, right? I mean, I had no idea what I was doing. Wait, is there supposed to be, like, some... some finish line, or... [Chase] Are we supposed to be looking for something, or just... trying to survive until someone comes and gets us? It's just... It was never clear. Exactly. I always felt the same way. - How's that valid, Doctor? - It's valid insomuch as she's the first participant we've spoken to, and she agrees with me. Therefore, I think it's completely valid. Please, continue. I don't get it. We... Why is it that we can't remember anything? And how do you do good or bad in... in a thing you don't understand? That's the big question here, for all of us. Nature versus nurture. Can we change a person's circumstances, and by doing so, change a person? In hopes of that... your memories have been erased, for now, giving you all a chance to begin again. She has had violent verbal or physical encounters with at least half of her cohorts thus far. Is that a win as far as we're concerned? Is it? I hope not. Well, I think she's done remarkably well. - [Professor] I disagree. - Then we disagree. Yes, we do, avidly. Anyone else? I have to say that I... I lean towards not allowing her back into the process as well. - And why is that? - Because... none of her pre-simulation criteria have been matched yet. She has proven to be reckless, self-serving, and... and rather bloodthirsty. Hoarding weapons and information for herself. So that is what I am basing it on, my assessment of available data. Okay. Who woke me up? Why is this happening to me? That is something I'm afraid we don't have an answer to. You... may have very well done it to yourself, it seems. - [Dr. Stevenson] But that's very strange. - [bang on table] I think it's lunchtime, folks. So put your pissy little platitudes back in your petty little pockets for a minute, and head on off toward the executive cafe. I'll join you there in a little bit. But first, let's you and me have a little talk. How's that sound? Sit out in the sun, have a little chat. Sound good? Do I have a choice? [chuckles] [whistling "I've Been Working on the Railroad"] [door slides open] Sorry about that. I could tell where they were headed. Those idiots love to talk and talk and hear themselves speak. They'll fight over the color of a fucking toothbrush, if you let 'em. - [sighs] - But yep, you got a few more sessions of that to deal with, if they don't come to a consensus when they vote later, about if you're still rehabilitation material or not. - That is real lemonade, by the way. - Oh, so it's not just in my mind? [laughing] You're a funny little fucker. [inhales deeply] Anyhoo, listen. Between you and me, really, 'cause I don't give a shit what those dipshits inside the star chamber got to say, I really don't. They're here so we can keep getting government funding on this shit. That's the way it goes. I gotta sit there and listen to 'em, that might be true, but I don't gotta do everything they say. They make... recommendations to me, and then I... go out and find ways to make things happen. - You understand? - [sighs] I get shit done. And that... is why I'm still here and in charge, for no other reason. I'm not following you. [sighs] Look, I don't believe in this shit. I didn't design it. I didn't come up with it. And I think it's a big waste of time and money on people who, frankly, don't deserve it. All this fuss and mess. Not when you got cops out there runnin' around getting shot and killed because they don't have the proper gear to fight crime with in the first place. But... I'm the man they put in charge, and I'm the guy who's expected to try and implement this pilot program on a state level. So... [sighs] ...I got everybody watching over me like a bunch of fucking hawks. All the way up to the president of the United States herself. Even she's watching over this. But we got a few tricks up our sleeves, the governor and me, you just trust me on that. And as for you, you're gonna go back in there, if they allow you to, onto that island, you're gonna just keep doing what you've been doing, dealing with whatever those little weasels in the control room throw at you. And trust me, missy, they got a whole bunch of freaky shit coming up. Surprising stuff. All kinds of crap that can kill you. And guess what? If you die in there, you're dead out here, too. So, is that what happened to Brody? Brody. That guy was a piece of shit rapist and murderer, and he got right back to it the second he had the chance. He's gone. - [sighs] - Out. Dead. See, if you do something wrong, the island, it pays you back. If you kill somebody, it kills you. Cause and effect. It was built to do that. But, guess what? It wasn't the game that got to him first. It was one of you. Bet you didn't know that. No. No, I didn't. - But it figures, now that I know... - Yeah, well, he died. Medical team says it's the shock of it, seeing yourself die that does it, but whatever it is, he's gone. Anyhoo... [clears throat] You've been an odd duck in there, with your nightmares and whatnot. Figuring a lot of shit out. Most of your type, by which I mean criminal pieces of shit like yourself, just don't react like you do to this thing. So, listen to me and know this. I'm gonna be keeping my eye on you from now on. And I will be watching every fucking thing that you do if you go back inside, you got that, sweetie? Yes, sir. Sorry. Warden. Oh, don't worry about it. Consider that one a freebie. [burps] We'll talk again before you go, I'm sure. [ominous music playing] [Dr. Stevenson] Miss? Can... Can you hear me? Did you understand what I said? [Dr. Stevenson's voice echoes] Miss? Can you hear me? Miss? [Dr. Stevenson scoffs] Did you understand what I said? No, sorry. I think I zoned out there for a second. I said that we have met privately and conferred, and it would be our preference to have you reenter the program at this time. [Chase] What? No. No, no, no. I'm sorry, but, no, thank you. I am not going back there. I'm sorry. That's not up to you. A decision has been reached. - No! - And we're very confident that you can... No, I'm not going back there! Do you not understand that? You wanna know what I think about your fucking decision? Fuck your decision, okay? Fuck you and fuck this shit! [classical music playing] [distorted] Let go! [yelps] [distorted] Fuck going back! [distorted] Stop! [Chase, distorted] I'm not going back! [gasps] [breathing rapidly] Act like a dog, end up on a leash, you understand? Truth be told, I was hoping you'd get tossed out of the program. I don't like having a wild card like you in there. What is that place, in my dreams? That room. What have I done? Hmm? That place, I've seen it before... The blood. What does that all mean? You can't just keep fucking with my mind like that. And that woman, who is she? [whispers] Sorry, little lady. That's for me to know and you to find out. [grunts] [groans] [chuckling] Well, well, well! You got a pretty good little right hook on you there! [Chase panting] - I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. Plenty of convicts wanted to take a poke at me over the years, boys way bigger than you. Not too many of them did, though. So that puts you in a, shall we say, select group. Yeah, I thought I'd meet you out here in the sun, help get you back in the mood for... - For what? - You know what. [mimicking electrocution sounds] [laughs] Please, I just don't wanna go back in. Do not put me back in there, please. We're done talking. I want you to just take a little time and get yourself back in it, 'cause it's all about to get a lot more intense now, thanks to you. And just so we're sure we truly understand each other, these folks are gonna help remind you who's the boss here. She's all yours. [grunting] [fighting grunts] [fighting grunts] [Chase wails] Please leave us. [woman] Now! [indistinct female voice over loudspeaker] [door beeps, shuts] I'm Doctor Wyss. I'm the psychiatrist. I heard there was an... accident, - and I wanted to see how you were doing. - Yeah, an accident. I just accidentally got in the way of a lot of fists. I don't have much time. This is against protocol, and I shouldn't be here. But the warden can be such a... fool sometimes. Before we began this, during the testing, do you remember anything before you woke up on the island? Anything at all? Not really, no. Well, they told us you wouldn't remember anything, but we never know for sure. Nothing that's happening here is for sure. [scoffs] Well, I'll tell you what's for sure, I don't wanna go back. I understand, but we desperately need you in there. Just know this. Sometimes the journey isn't just physical, yes? You gotta stay alive. Being strong is vitally important but is not the only thing. - What does that even... - That's all I can say for now. God knows if you'll recall any of this once you're back, but if you do, stay on your path and find your way back. Don't let the warden use you for his purpose. I shouldn't be saying this without any proof, but I believe he's been tampering with the results of the tests somehow. That's why, when... - you woke up on your own... - [door opens] - ...I wanted to ask you to be my eyes... - [nurse] Can I help you? [sighs] No, thank you. I was just leaving. You're not supposed to be in here alone with her. I have every right to check up on one of my patients, especially one who woke up in the middle of a trial. [door opens] - [nurse] Take these. - [Chase] No. No more medicine. You need it for the next stage of the process. I said no. It's either pills or... [sighs] Fine, pills it is. [guards speaking indistinctly] [guards speaking indistinctly] [guard] Open! Kill the shield! [guard] Shield open. [guard yells indistinctly] - [man grunts] - [Chase groans] [coughs] [Chase gasps for air] [man grunts] [fighting grunts] [grunting] [panting] [groans] [panting] [Chase panting] [helicopter whirring] [sighs] [suspenseful music playing] [electronic buzzing] [indistinct chatter] [door opens] [man grunts] [man groans] [Chase panting] [indistinct chatter] [man and woman talking indistinctly] [conversation continues indistinctly] [woman speaks indistinctly] [indistinct dialogue continues in the background] [suspenseful music playing] [Chase] Oh, no. No. [Chase] Cooper. Taylor? [Chase] Oh, my God. No. No. So, how do you like it? [pistols cocking] - What is this place? - [Warden] You know what it is. No, I don't. Sure, you do. Think back. Seriously, where am I? It's home. No. No, I've never been here before. [laughing] Okay. Whatever you say, Chase. [Chase grunts] Just hold onto her, boys. Help's comin'. [panting] [whimpers] [Dr. Conrad coughs] Yeah, I know, I know. Filthy habit. You think they've got a chance in there? Not if I got anything to say about it. [Warden] Go ahead! Light her up! [electronic whirring] [theme music playing]
