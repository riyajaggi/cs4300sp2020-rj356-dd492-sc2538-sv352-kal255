 [chuckles] [theme music playing] [suspenseful music playing] [birds chirping] Finally decided to rejoin the living, huh? I decided I needed some warmth from the fire. Haven't really thought much past that. Got it. I was just asking to see if you're done with your antics for now, that's all. My antics? You know what? If no one gives a damn why we're here or what the hell's going on, then why should I? You go swimming? Yeah. So what? You need something? Breakfast. I mean, I called down and placed an order. It hasn't arrived yet. I mean, it should be here in a couple of minutes. Great. Tell 'em to hurry up. I'm starving. That's some bullshit. - Sorry, d'you order something too? - You know what? Just forget it. No. You said bullshit. So bullshit. Why don't you save us some time and tell me what's up your ass again today? You know, it's just... It's pretty hard for me to imagine you ever starving in your life. I mean, ever. I'm a skinny-ass white girl. Doesn't mean I don't like to eat. It's just an observation. Don't worry about it. You wanna go gather some food before the others wake up? Yeah, I'm gonna need something pretty soon. Yep. Let's go. [Brody] Sure. Don't fall for the old, "Hey, there's a waterfall over there" trick, like I did. Why don't you put the logs on the fire and keep it going until we get back? [chuckles] [grunts] [monkey screeches in background] [breathes heavily] [Chase] Hey. Worst toilet paper ever. Hey, did you sleep somewhere else last night? Yeah, just down the beach. I was fighting sand fleas. Gotcha. Hey, is there any more of that food left? [clicks tongue] No, uh... but they went out to go get some. Who? - That redhead chick. - KC? Yeah, and the rapist guy. Um... Brody or whatever. Oh, okay. [sighs] [Brody] Just a little further. [birds chirping] How you doing back there? - All right. - Yeah? - Be careful. - Thank you. When we get there, uh... we can jump in the water and cool off. I don't like the water. You can't swim? I can. Just don't like to. [chuckles] How do you know something like that? We can't even remember anything about ourselves. Can just feel it. You go ahead. I'll watch. - Cooper. - Me? That's your name, right? Oh, yeah. According to that tag. Where are you off to in such a hurry? Been talking to Mason about designing some hunting traps. I'm getting tired of coconuts and berries. You got a sec? [sighs] - You're pretty quiet. - Am I? So far, at least. - Just taking it all in. - Yeah? - Waiting to pounce? - It's not like that. I only speak when I have something to say. [inhales sharply] You had a lot to say yesterday. I don't think he cares at all about our survival. It's about power for him. - You don't want any? - I want to live. Whatever way I have to. Also, I kinda hate that guy's face. Well, you showed excellent restraint in not punching it. Thank you. Glad someone noticed. What's that? [inhales sharply] Just something I picked up along the way. On a desert island? It's deserted island. Not desert... Nice distraction. Where'd you get that backpack from? - Promise you won't tell the others? - I won't. - Promise? - I promise. - Cross your heart? - [chuckling] Cross my heart, sure. [chuckles] I just came across these things. Found this pretty interesting. And a couple other things. [Cooper] What do you think it means? Fuck if I know. Do you want a piece? [Cooper] It's 39 again. It's not a coincidence. [Mason] Cooper! Hey, Cooper! Come on, let's go. Uh, I should go, but... you're right. Keep this stuff to yourself for now. [squawks] [distant thunder rumbling] [thunder rumbling] I guess we're gonna have to climb up to get the rest of them. Shouldn't be too hard. I should've got Chase's knife. Would've made things a lot easier. Not even hers. She just took it. - I know. - It's not right. - [thunder rumbles] - Yeah. We need to have another meeting when we get back. We'll add that to the list. What happened with the two of you... out there? Honestly? Nothing. Nothin'? [chuckles] Nothin'. Nothin', nothin', nothin'? I mean... There was a moment, uh... We talked about living here, and... I mean, we even kissed for a moment, but, - yeah, it was... - Like this? [tense music playing] [vulture screeches] [screeching] [thunder rumbling] Is that coming or going? Doesn't matter. It's gonna come one of these days, and we're not gonna be ready for it. We need to build a shelter. Or something. Donovan's not gonna make it in this weather. He's barely making it as it is. [Blair] He's gonna die if we leave him out... We need to move inland, especially because of that. - Hey, stop. We discussed this already. - Yeah, but we didn't vote. - Doesn't matter. - [Taylor] Guys! - We didn't vote. - [Taylor] Stop! - It doesn't matter. - It does matter. Because I think moving inland and avoiding that... Then why don't you fucking move inland? I'm starting to think every word Chase says about you is true. - Hey, you better back the fuck up. - Or what? [Brody grunts] - Hey! Are you okay? - [Chase] Guys, stop! [Moses] You okay? - You okay? - [chuckles] Wow! [thunder rumbling] You fucking hit me. - [grunts] - [Chase yells] Don't do that! - [KC] Stop it! - [Moses] Hey, man! [KC] Get off of him! - [Moses] Come on, dude! - Brody, stop! [Taylor] Guys! - What the hell, man? - I'm cool. I'm cool. - [Brody] I'm cool. - [panting] It's okay. - [yelps] - [Taylor] Stop! - [grunts] - [Taylor] Chase! - [Cooper] Okay. - [Chase] What is wrong with you? You gonna be a crazy fuck about it, then fine, you win. [chuckles] Come on. I'm just teasing, man. It's all a joke. It's all good. You know what? I'm a lover, not a fighter. All right, then, give me the knife. Put the knife down, man. Come on, dude. - Give me the knife. - Why should you have it? - Hm? - [thundering] This is bullshit. All our stuff should be together in one place. - That's the right thing to do. - Yeah? Like your compass? And your matches? You know what? I'm gonna go to the grove. Anyone is invited. If you wanna come... [scoffs] ...fine. [thunder rumbling] Are you okay? [Moses sniffles] [thunderclap] [suspenseful music playing] [thunderclap] [wind howling] [thunderclap] Everybody, follow me! [Blair] Where? - [Blair] Mason, help Donovan. - [Mason] Get him up! Hey! [Chase] Come on! Let's go! [Mason] Yeah, there you go. - [Mason] All right! - [Blair] Where the fuck are you taking us? - Come on! - [Blair] Careful! [Mason] All right! Come on! - Come on, we all get in! - [Taylor] Yes, it does! - Where the hell did you find this thing? - Get in! - Where'd this come from? - Who cares! Do you wanna argue about it or get out of the rain? You're always finding things! Out of nowhere! [Mason] All right, get him in! Get him in first! Come on! [Mason] Where the hell did this storm come from? [thunderclap] [thunder rumbling] [thunderclap] [indistinct distorted voices] [ominous music playing] [woman] Please... I beg you. - [woman] Get out of my... - [gunshot] [Cooper] Chase! [raindrops pattering] Chase! Jesus! - I was looking everywhere for you! - Get inside! I know that you're hiding something! - Just get inside! - Where'd you find this thing? Out in the water. Who cares? Just get in! You went back in the water with that thing out there? [panting] - [Chase] Help me! Hold it up! - [Cooper] All right. [wind gusting] [birds chirping] [groans] [sighs] [sighs] [sighs] [panting] [beeps] [panting] [gasps] [Chase panting] Morning, stranger. Hey. Where is everybody? They're sleeping down the beach. - In a shelter. - Shelter? You found or you made? Found. Why were you running down the beach so fast just now? Saw the smoke. I'm with everybody, so... I didn't know who or what it was. Just little old me. Yeah, I see that. I come bearing gifts. Yeah, and a spear. Yeah. That's for protection. From what? You never know. Do you wanna wake the others or, uh, should I? No, I'm good. Why don't you? Okay. Where are they? About 50 yards. In the trees. It's orange. You can't miss it. Orange? You'll see. Oh, and, uh... by the way, could you keep an eye on the fire until I get back? Yeah. [panting] [under breath] Okay. - [branch snaps] - [bird chirps] [beep] [buzzes] [sighs] [under breath] Okay. It can't be 39, uh... [sniffs] Right, think, think, uh... Thirty-nine. Three plus nine is 12. [beeping] [buzzes] Fuck! Okay. Calm. Think. It's not 39. - It's not 12. - [bird chirping] Um... It's not 39, it's not 12, then... One plus two is three. [beeps] [buzzes] Damn it! Okay. What about, um... Okay. Oh... Okay, we'll start with three. - [beeps] - [breathes heavily] And then nine. [whispers] One, two, three, four, - five, six, seven, eight, nine. - [beeping] Yes! [chuckles] Okay. [breathes heavily] Shit. [panting] [footsteps approaching] I thought I told you to watch the fire. That's what this is. More fuel. And I had to pee, but... that was private. [ominous music playing] [KC breathes heavily] [whispers] It's sliced. [sighs] Wow! It looks nice, right? - What does? - The water. Like this. You should try it. Are you okay? I'm fine. That doesn't seem true. You sure that you're fine? I just... I've just been watching you - since you've been back, and I... - Go away. Why? What'd I do? I don't need you. I don't need you, I don't need you watching me, or spying on me, or trying to help. Get the fuck away from me. Fine. I know something happened out there, KC. I can tell. Yell if you want to, but I know Brody did something to you just like he did with Chase, so I came down here to check on you, that's it. Don't hate me because of what he did. It's my fault... What went on out there between him and me. - I got no one else to blame but me. - No. No. That's not true. I kept pushing it. Pushing him to be with me. To prove that he liked me more. So he got me alone, and... he did what men always try to do. You wanna know something? I don't hate 'em... Men. I hate women. Other girls. I don't know... why. I just always have. It's... It's just this thing, living inside of me. This urge. Now this has happened. It's my fault. [melancholic music playing] Don't say that. He attacked you, didn't he? Didn't he? - Yeah. - Then that's what happened. I told you to watch him. Sorry. [Moses] Yeah. Hey, guys. What do you think? Look. Is that a hat? [Taylor] Yeah. You like it? Yeah, that's great. The sun's bad out here. [Taylor] You want one? [Moses] Yeah, I'll take one. [Taylor] I'll trade you for one of those spears. - How you doing? - I'm fine. Not so sure everybody should be preparing for war, though. I'm just sharpening my blade. Sure. Let me ask you something. You, um... You want to go up to the cliffs today? - Just want to see what's up there. - It's dangerous. And? For what? To look around. Count exactly how many hills there are. Maybe climb up one of them. See if I can spot anything. What? Got something else to do today? You need to work on your nice side. [sighs] - Pretty please? - [chuckles] What do I get out of the deal? My smile. It's all I got. Yeah, okay. You got a nice smile. [chuckles] [Chase panting] [both panting] It's a rush, isn't it? [breathes heavily] - Making it up here and not falling. - [chuckling] Yeah. That part feels great. [Chase exclaims] Where the fuck are we? [fly buzzing] You're not trying to do the mountains today, are you? I might as well. I'm halfway there. No, you're a quarter of the way at most. You'll never make it up and back by dark. - Well, I'm gonna try. - Hey, don't... Don't touch me! I'm... I'm sorry. - It's fine. I'm just... - No, it's my fault. I was just trying to keep you... You know what? You do what you need to do. - Thanks. - But if it was me, I'd come back up here with some... Whoever you can trust. And get an early start so you're back in time. - What do you mean? - Before night. That's what a sane person would do. [birds squawking] [exhales] Good idea. I guess our day is done. [sighs] Taylor! You caught a fish! You owe me a hat! [squeals] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! That's amazing! [Chase] Is this the way we came? [Cooper] Seems right. [Chase sighs] So we just keep going? [suspenseful music playing] You gotta be kidding me. [scoffs] [Chase] What is this thing doing here? [Cooper] No idea. It's an old resort of some kind. Hotel. In the middle of fucking nowhere. Why, though? That's a good question. [chirps] - Maybe we can live here. - I was thinking the same thing. Wonder if there's any water. [sound of rushing water] Well, that answers that. [groans] Shh, shh, shh, shh. Just rest. What happened? Well... uh, you pushed me in front of a shark. But I decided to forgive you. [chuckles] - Nope. - Lucky me. - Yeah, lucky is definitely a word for it. - [coughs] But you need to get some rest, okay? - No more speaking. - Okay. Just shut your eyes. I'll take care of you. Do you want any food? No, I'm okay. Thanks. Is he out of the woods yet? Well, um, his fever's down, which is a really good sign. And if I can keep his wound from getting infected, then, yeah, he might be okay. How do you know all of this stuff? I have no idea. Hey. Look who's back. - [Cooper] Hey. What's up? - Hey guys, look who showed up for dinner. [Cooper] I see dinner's been taken care of already. You want some? - No, I'm okay. [chuckles] - Hey, look. My spear's bigger than yours. See? And, yes, that's a double entendre for his dick, in case you guys were wondering. Where were you? I wanted to take someone out into the trees and see if I'd get jumped. Turned out pretty good. So, FYI, ladies, Cooper can keep his hands to himself. Actually, we climbed up the cliff to get a better look around. We found a bunch of old buildings. A former hotel or something. It's got beds and water, - all kinds of stuff. - Beds? - Beds. [chuckles] - [Blair] Wow. - Yeah. - [Moses and Blair] Really? You know, we can build beds here, and we don't have to climb a cliff. I mean, what's the big deal, anyway? Hm? Is it the fact that I found the place? Is that what bugs you so much? No, it's the fact that you tried to rape me, that I can't really call it home. - Guys! - Stop saying that! I didn't rape anyone. You sure about that? Why don't we ask KC? Huh, KC? How're you doing? Is there anything you wanna share? Drop the fucking spear, Brody. Shut your fucking mouth. You like causing drama, don't you? Hm? We were doing just fine until you came back. But I promise you this, I'm coming for you. [Cooper] Go back to your waterfall and cool off, man. Anyone wanna join him, go ahead, but do it now. Brody. Can you believe that guy? - Oh, what? You guys want me to go too? - Yeah, would you mind? - Fucking leave. - You did see him attack me, right? You're always fighting with him. - He attacked me first! - I'm not taking sides anymore. Chase, you're threatening him, he's threatening you. It's nonstop, - and it's exhausting! - [overlapping chatter] We're done here for the night! Wrap it up! - I can't believe you guys. - [Cooper] Hey! [sighs] [sighs] [Blair] Just go. [thunder rumbling] [woman] Chase... [shudders] Don't do that. [Chase shudders] I beg of you. I beg of you. Please. [screams] [breathes heavily] [echoing] Oh, please... [sniffles] - What're you doing? - [Cooper] Come on! [grunts] - Guys, stop it! Let go! - Why the hell would you do that? Look at that! [Blair] You can't just fucking kill people! I didn't kill anybody. I... I didn't do that! Crazy fucking bitch. No, it wasn't me. It wasn't! - You're such a fucking liar! - I'm not lying! - What is wrong with you? - [Cooper] It's too much! - Why the hell would you do that, Chase? - I didn't do it! - [Cooper] Chase! - That wasn't me! Chase, stop! [grunts] Hey, come on! - [grunts] - Stop it! - [grunts] - [groans] - [yells] - [grunts] [Chase murmurs] [loud thud] [feedback ringing] [breathes heavily] [Chase] Where the hell am I? [ominous music playing] [theme music playing]
