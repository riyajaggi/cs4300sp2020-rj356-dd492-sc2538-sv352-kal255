 The Emperor's New School (2006–2008): Season 1, Episode 10 - Peasant for a Day - full transcript 
 Kuzco enjoys annual Kuzco veneration day, when everybody -except Malina- obeys him unconditionally, but Mr. Moleguaco cruelly turns the class assignment around: who draws a golden stone will play emperor for a day. Malina cheats so not Kuzco but Kronk gets the part, then sort of chaperons Kuzco as peasant for a day and joins forces with him and Yzma when Kronk makes too many changes.

THE BEST OF MANY COMPLETELY CALLED FOR AND ENTIRELY NOT MADE UP HOLIDAYS CELEBRATING THE WORLD'S GREATEST TREASURE... ME. NOT HIM. OR THEM. OR HER. ME! AND IT'S THE BEST BECAUSE NO ONE'S LEFT OUT. ALL THE VILLAGERS IN MY KINGDOM GET TO DO WHATEVER I SAY. HEY, I'M A PEOPLE PERSON. EXCEPT, OF COURSE, WHEN THEY COME TO ME WITH THEIR COMPLAINTS, THEY'RE ALL ME, ME, ME. IT'S THE WORST. BUT CHECK THIS OUT. I'M LETTING KRONK PLAY HORSEY. GIDDYUP, GIDDYUP. HOW NICE AM I? WHAT IS GOING ON? GOOD MORNING, MALINA, MY SMOOCHY POT PIE. YOU MAY BOW IF YOU WISH. OH, YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? OR CURTSY. WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU. DON'T HUG HIM THOUGH. NO TOUCHING. KUZCO, WHY ARE YOU SITTING ON KRONK? BETTER YET, WHY IS KRONK LETTING YOU SIT ON HIM? HE HAS TO. IT'S KUZCO ALLEGIANCE DAY. I SAID... IT'S KUZCO ALLEGIANCE DAY! [PLAYING FANFARE POORLY] WHY DO WE REHEARSE, GUYS? BESIDES, DIDN'T YOU HEAR YOUR KUZCO ALARM SUNDIAL THIS MORNING? UH, YEAH, BECAUSE I DEFINITELY DIDN'T THROW THAT THING AWAY THE MOMENT YOU GAVE IT TO ME. I KNEW YOU'D LOVE IT. OH, BY THE WAY, YOU OWE ME 29.95. NO, I DON'T. AND NO, I'M NOT GOING ALONG WITH ANOTHER COMPLETELY UNCALLED FOR, ENTIRELY MADE UP HOLIDAY FOR KUZCO THE EGO MANIAC. QUICK TIP. WHEN SOMEONE CALLS YOU A NAME YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, LIKE SAY, EGO MANIAC, JUST ACT MAD. ALSO, MY HAIR LOOKS PERFECTER. EGO MANIAC? DISMOUNT. OW! HEAD. JUST BECAUSE I THINK BEING EMPEROR MAKES ME BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE DOESN'T MEAN I'M AN EGO MANIAC. OR DOES IT? I'M A LITTLE FUZZY ON WHAT IT MEANS TO BE HONEST. FOR BEING HONEST, YOU'RE TECHNICALLY NOT THE EMPEROR UNTIL YOU GRADUATE. ALSO, I'M AFRAID OF THUNDER. AND I HAVE A WEIRD RASH. TOO HONEST? SORRY. YES, KUZCO. EGO MANIAC MEANS YOU THINK YOU'RE BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE. BUT, NEWS FLASH, YOU'RE NOT. THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS OUT THERE NON EMPERORS DO THAT YOU COULD NEVER DO. WHAT? YOU MEAN THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY KINGDOM WHO HAVE TALENTS AND STRENGTHS THAT I DON'T HAVE? YES. AND THE SOONER YOU REALIZE THAT, THE BETTER. ONE OF THESE DAYS, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE AND LEARN THAT IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU. All: I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE KUZCO THE COOLEST EMPEROR AROUND. AND TO THE EMPIRE FOR WHICH HE RULES... I DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE TODAY THOUGH, RIGHT, BECAUSE TODAY IS DEFINITELY ALL ABOUT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME. I DON'T DECIDE WHAT GETS TAUGHT AROUND HERE. OK, IT'S MY SCHOOL SO I SORT OF DO, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S MY FAULT, DOES IT? HUMILIATING A HARD WORKING TEACHER BY DRESSING HIM LIKE KUZCO IS YET ANOTHER WAY WE CELEBRATE KUZCO ALLEGIANCE DAY! MR. M, IN HONOR OF KUZCO ALLEGIANCE DAY, YOU THINK YOU COULD SCAT THE REST OF THE LESSON? YOU KNOW, KUZCO'S GREAT SHOOBA DOOBA ZOW! NO, I COULDN'T. FRANKLY, TEACHERS DESERVE A DAY OF APPRECIATION MORE THAN YOU DO. SO INSTEAD OF DISCUSSING WAYS TO CHERISH YOU, I HAVE AN EXERCISE I'D LIKE TO TRY. EACH OF YOU WILL RECEIVE A STONE FROM THIS BOWL. THOSE OF YOU WHO GET PLAIN STONES WILL BE REGULAR OLD HARD WORKING VILLAGERS. NOT A BIG SWITCH FOR MOST OF YOU. BUT WHOEVER GETS THIS GOLD STONE WILL BE EMPEROR FOR A DAY. LIKE THAT CAN HAPPEN. THAT CAN HAPPEN? NOW, I NEED A VOLUNTEER TO HAND OUT THE STONES, BECAUSE FRANKLY, THEY'RE HEAVY, AND I'M TIRED. I'LL HAND OUT THE STONES, MR. MOLEGUACO. MALINA, PERFECT. YOU'RE REALLY THE ONLY STUDENT I TRUST HERE. THE REST OF YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT. I'LL TAKE THE GOLD STONE AND SOME FRIES. [LAUGHING] FRIES. NO. YOU DON'T GET TO PICK WHICH STONE YOU WANT. IT'S A RANDOM DRAWING. OH, I GET IT. YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT SO NO ONE WILL KNOW YOU GAVE ME THE GOLD STONE ON PURPOSE. WAY AHEAD OF YOU. NO. I'M SAYING THAT BECAUSE IT'S A RANDOM DRAWING. VERY CONVINCING. KEEP IT UP. GOLD STONE, GOLD STONE. PLEASE LET ME GET THE GOLD STONE. I'LL GET A PIE IF I GET THE GOLD STONE. HEY, THIS ISN'T GOLD. NO, THIS IS. SEE, SHINY. BY THE WAY, WHAT DOES IT MEAN AGAIN IF YOU GET THE GOLD STONE? IT MEANS CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER, KRONK. FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS, YOU ARE OUR EMPEROR AND HAVE CONTROL OVER THE KINGDOM. AS FOR THE REST OF YOU, YOUR ASSIGNMENT IS TO PAY ALLEGIANCE TO KRONK. RESPECT HIM, BRING HIM GIFTS. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, EACH STUDENT MUST BOW TO HIM IN A SHOW OF HUMILITY. YOU MEAN EVERYONE EXCEPT ME, RIGHT? NO. I MEAN ESPECIALLY YOU, KUZCO. NO ONE HERE HAS MORE TO LEARN ABOUT BEING A HARD WORKING VILLAGER AND THE TRUE OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF BEING EMPEROR THAN YOU. OH, I GET IT. YOU'RE JUST MESSING WITH ME. THIS IS A PRANK, RIGHT? [LAUGHING] YOU'RE TOO MUCH, MR. M. OK, I GIVE UP. YOU GOT ME. WHEW! THAT WAS FUN. I'M SERIOUS. THEN THAT MEANS... ♪ KRONK ALLEGIANCE, KRONK ALLEGIANCE ♪ ♪ KRONK ALLEGIANCE DAY IS TODAY ♪ ♪ KRONK ALLEGIANCE, KRONK ALLEGIANCE ♪ ♪ KRONK ALLEGIANCE DAY IS TODAY ♪ KRONK, IF YOU'RE EMPEROR, THEN I GUESS TODAY I'M THE EMPEROR'S ADVISOR. I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN YZMA MIGHT GET UPSET. KRONK, PRINCIPAL ANZI IS A CLEVER DISGUISE. I'M YZMA, REMEMBER? YZMA! REALLY? YOU KNOW, I SHOULD WRITE THAT DOWN. YOU GOT A PEN? AND PAPER? AND A DESK. EMPEROR GUARDS. THEY ARE ONE HARDWORKING BUNCH. I GOTTA START TIPPING THOSE GUYS. HOW MANY Qs ARE IN YOUR NAME? WAIT, BACK UP. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? NEVER MIND THAT. IF YOU'RE EMPEROR, WHAT DOES THAT MAKE KUZCO? OH, HE GETS TO BE A VILLAGER. HE'S SUPPOSED TO SHOW HIS HUMILITY BY BOWING TO ME. PERSONALLY, I DON'T CARE FOR THE BOWING. DON'T NEED THE EGO BOOST, BUT IT'S PART OF THE CLASS ASSIGNMENT. [MUTED SCREAM] PERFECT. KUZCO WILL TURN INTO A LLAMA OR A RABBIT, OR EVEN A FROG BEFORE HE'D BOW TO YOU. HE DID TURN INTO THOSE THINGS, REMEMBER? MY POINT IS, THE ONLY THING KUZCO IS CAPABLE OF PRAISING IS HIMSELF. WHICH MEANS HE WON'T BOW TO YOU. HE'LL FAIL THE ASSIGNMENT, AND TOMORROW, I'LL BECOME EMPRESS. [LAUGHING] YOU REALLY SHOULD CHECK WITH YZMA... ABOUT ALL THAT. OH, FORGET IT. OK. TIP TIME. WHOSE GOT CHANGE FOR A TWENTY? WOW. YOU GUYS ARE ON IT. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. YOU'RE THINKING, KUZCO'S NOT A HARD WORKING HUMBLE VILLAGER. HOW CAN HE SURVIVE WITHOUT ALL HIS MONEY AND POWER? HE ESPECIALLY CAN'T BOW TO KRONK, RIGHT? WELL, YOU'RE WRONG. I CAN'T BOW TO KRONK! OK, YOU'RE RIGHT. LOOK, I AGREED TO EAT LUNCH WITH YOU BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MIGHT CHEER YOU UP. IF IT'S NOT WORKING, I HAVE BETTER OFFERS. FINE. GO ON. ABANDON ME IN MY HOUR OF NEED. HEY, THAT TURKEY SMELLS GOOD. CAN I COME WITH? KUZCO, STOP IT. OW! I MEAN... THAT CHICKENFISH PATTY DIDN'T HURT AT ALL. I'M MANLY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU THINK YOU'RE TOO GOOD TO BE A VILLAGER LIKE THE REST OF US? UH, YEAH. THAT CHICKENFISH PATTY IS NOT AS FAST AS IT THINKS IT IS. HMM? BY THE WAY, WHAT IS A CHICKENFISH? KUZCO, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN EMPEROR SINCE YOU CAME TO SCHOOL. YOU'RE ALREADY A VILLAGER. ALL YOU NEED TO DO TO PULL OFF THIS ASSIGNMENT IS LEARN A LITTLE HUMILITY. THAT THE VILLAGERS ARE HARD WORKING, GOOD NATURED, KIND PEOPLE. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE RIGHT. I AM ALREADY A VILLAGER. MINUS THE HARD WORKING, GOOD NATURED, KIND PART. YEAH. WE CAN WORK ON THAT. BUT THAT'S THE IDEA. YOU KNOW, THEY SHOULD REALLY FIX THE ROOF. MAYBE THE CHOIR SHOULD PRACTICE SOMEWHERE ELSE. [CHOIR STOPS SINGING] ANYWAY, BACK TO ME. THIS IS GONNA WORK. I'M GONNA BE AN HONEST TO GOODNESS VILLAGER. WITH ALL THE WONDERFUL VILLAGER RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES. IT'S TIME FOR KUZCO'S DOODLES. THAT'S THE PART OF THE SHOW WHERE I GET TO DRAW ALL OF THE COOL VILLAGER THINGS I CAN DO. THIS IS ME IN HUMBLE VILLAGER CLOTHES. I'M SO CUTE. AND LOOK, I CAN SLEEP ON A HAYSTACK. I CAN MILK PUMAS. NICE, KITTY. I CAN SWIM IN MUD. AND I CAN EAT IT. ARE YOU DONE? ARE YOU KIDDING? I CAN BATTLE A FIERCE CHICKENFISH. WITH A TRIDENT. OK. THAT'S ENOUGH. DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S WHAT A VILLAGER IS? ABSOLUTELY. WHY? DUH...LOOKS LIKE I'VE GOT A LOT TO SHOW YOU. I CAN'T SLEEP ON THIS STUFF. FOR THE RECORD, MILKING PUMA... BAD IDEA. [PUMA ROARS] YUCK! THIS MUD TASTES LIKE MUD. HELLO. NONE OF THESE FISH LOOK LIKE CHICKENS. THAT'S BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A CHICKENFISH. THERE'S NOT? SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THAT MY PRE CONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT THE VILLAGERS WERE WRONG? UH...YES. AND IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GET SOME FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. THE FIRST THING I LEARNED WAS THAT VILLAGERS HAVE TO GROW THEIR OWN FOOD. I DON'T HAVE TO PLANT ALL THESE, DO I? YES. YOU DO. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn NEXT, I LEARNED THAT VILLAGERS DON'T BUY THEIR STUFF AT EAST MART, THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THEIR OWN BLANKETS AND STUFF. UNTANGLE, AISLE 5. I ALSO LEARNED THAT SOME OF THE VILLAGERS ARE EXPERT POTTERY MAKERS. I GAVE IT A SHOT. AFTER YOU MAKE A VASE, OR POT OR WHATEVER, YOU GET TO PAINT IT. MINE'S A GOOD VASE, RIGHT? YEAH. MAYBE YOU SHOULD STICK TO BEING EMPEROR. YOU KNOW, MALINA, DON'T TELL ANYBODY, BUT TODAY, I'VE LEARNED TO APPRECIATE THE HARD WORKING VILLAGERS. I FEEL LIKE I'M ONE OF THE PEOPLE. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M SORT OF GOOD AT IT. YOU'RE RIDING THE LLAMA BACKWARDS. YEAH, THAT'S WEIRD. I WONDERED WHERE HIS HEAD WENT. OTHER THAN THAT, I AGREE. I THINK YOU'VE LEARNED A LITTLE HUMILITY TODAY. AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE ULTIMATE TEST. BOWING TO KRONK. HUH? COME ON. ISN'T THAT TAKING IT A LITTLE TOO FAR? IF YOU DON'T BOW, YOU'LL FAIL THE CLASS. DO I HAVE TO BOW TO KRONK? HE'S THE EMPEROR FOR THE DAY. THE ASSIGNMENT WAS VERY CLEAR. WE BRING HIM THE GIFT AND BOW TO HIM. YEAH, AND I DON'T GET THAT. WHY ARE WE GIVING KRONK A LLAMA? HE'S THE EMPEROR. WE'RE HARD WORKING VILLAGERS. HE DOESN'T NEED GIFTS FROM US. YOU'RE ACTUALLY LEARNING THAT IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU. MAYBE I'M NOT WASTING MY TIME. NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG. WHEN I'M EMPEROR, GIFTS MAKE PERFECT SENSE. I DESERVE THEM. LOOK, IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. WHAT? I'M THE MOST SERIOUS HARD WORKING VILLAGER THERE IS. CAN I GET OFF THE LLAMA NOW? RIDING IT BACKWARDS IS MAKING ME SICK. [LAUGHING] LET'S SEE, ALL I HAVE TO DO DO BECOME EMPRESS IS... WAIT, DO I NEED A POTION FOR THAT? WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO? I WASN'T TALKING. YEAH. I HEARD YOU TALKING. NO, YOU DIDN'T. YOU'RE RIGHT. LISTEN. AS EMPEROR, ME AND THE BOYS HAVE BEEN LOOKING OVER THE FINANCIAL SCROLLS. KRONK, WHY ARE THESE GUARDS HERE? THIS IS MY SECRET LAB. YEAH. WELL, THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. THE LAB SPENDS WAY MORE MONEY THAN IT BRINGS IN. OH, BY THE WAY, SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG WITH THE SECRET LAB RIDE. GOOD TIMES. ANYWAY. THE IMPORTED BAT WINGS, THE ENCHANTED UNICORN HORNS, ALL THIS SQUARE FOOTAGE, WE CAN'T JUSTIFY THE EXPENSE. I GOTTA SHUT IT DOWN. [LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] YOU MUST BE JOKING. I WISH I WAS, BUT, YOU KNOW, THE NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP. NUMBERS? KRONK, YOU BARELY KNOW HOW TO COUNT. YEAH, BUT THIS IS JUST BASIC ACCOUNTING. I CAN HANDLE THAT. WELL, WHERE AM I SUPPOSED TO CONCOCT MY EVIL SCHEMES? YEAH, ABOUT THAT... THIS IS KIND OF AWKWARD, BUT I HAVE TO LET YOU GO. WE CAN'T AFFORD YOUR SALARY. YOU'RE FIRING ME? WE SAY LET GO BECAUSE IT SOUNDS BETTER. BUT YEAH, YOU'RE FIRED. YOU CAN'T DO THIS. ONLY THE EMPEROR CAN FIRE ME. [SCREAMING] [LAUGHING] OH, THIS IS AWKWARD. WELL, NO HARD FEELINGS. IF YOU SEE PRINCIPAL AMZI COULD YOU TELL HER I NEED TO FIRE HER, TOO. [DOOR SLAMS] OK, THE GUY WHO WANTS TO RENT THIS SPACE FOR AN ICE CREAM PARLOR WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE. [WATCH BEEPS] OH, GOTTA GO. BOWING TIME. ICE CREAM. GET YOUR ICE CREAM. CHOCOLATE CHIP. CHOCOLATE FUDGE SWIRL. KUZCO, COME ON. STOP FREAKING OUT. THIS ISN'T FREAKING OUT. THIS IS BEING DIFFICULT. WE'RE ALMOST THERE. JUST GO IN THE GYM, AND GET IT OVER WITH. NO. AND WHY ARE YOU SO STRONG? CAN WE TAKE A BREAK? I'M EXHAUSTED. YZMA? CONGRATULATIONS, KUZCO. APPARENTLY, YOU'RE NOT THE WORST EMPEROR IMAGINABLE AFTER ALL. WHAT DID KRONK DO? HE FIRED ME. SAYS THE SECRET LAB IS COSTING TOO MUCH. COOL. HE FIRED YOU JUST LIKE I DID. EXCEPT HE FIRED YOU FOR AN ACTUAL REASON. HEY, MAYBE THAT KRONKSTER IS NOT SUCH A BAD EMPEROR AFTER ALL. HMM. SAYS YOU. THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. NO. KRONK IS TO BLAME. AND WHOEVER PLACED HIM IN POWER, OF COURSE. YEAH, IT WAS THAT MR. MOLEGUACO AND HIS STUPID RANDOM DRAWING. I MADE KRONK EMPEROR. WHAT? DOUBLE WHAT? IT'S MY FAULT KRONK IS EMPEROR. I CHEATED. IT WASN'T RANDOM. I GAVE HIM THE GOLD STONE ON PURPOSE TO TEACH YOU A LESSON. I KNEW IT! WELL, ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T. BUT LET'S JUST SAY I DID. WELL, THAT'S A TOUCHING CONFESSION, MALINA. BUT I'M AFRAID THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? REGARDLESS OF HOW IT HAPPENED? KRONK IS EMPEROR. AND THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR IS ABSOLUTE. I KNEW THAT. EMPEROR KRONK CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS. UNTIL TOMORROW. OF COURSE, WHO KNOWS WHAT DAMAGE HE'LL MANAGE TO CAUSE BY THEN. UNLESS HE DECIDES TO QUIT. AND WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? YEAH. ONLY A MEATHEAD WOULD QUIT. WAIT A MINUTE. KRONK IS A MEATHEAD. KUZCO, WHAT WAS THE WORST PART ABOUT BEING EMPEROR? THAT'S EASY. LISTENING TO VILLAGER COMPLAINTS. THE WORST. OH, THEY'RE SO NEEDY. WE NEED MORE EQUIPMENT TO TILL THE SOIL. WE NEED MORE TIME TO WEAVE THE INTRICATE BLANKETS. HMM? I GUESS THOSE COMPLAINTS DO MAKE SENSE NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT. BUT LISTENING TO IT DAY IN AND DAY OUT, EW! IF IT WEREN'T FOR MY 24 SECOND SHUSH CLOCK... [DING] I WOULD'VE QUIT YEARS AGO. BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT AN EMPEROR I AM LATER. RIGHT NOW, WE NEED TO THINK OF A WAY TO MAKE KRONK QUIT. ANY IDEAS? WHAT? MY HAIR? I KNOW. IT'S AWFUL. TWO WORDS--SPLIT ENDS. LOOK, THE EMPIRE IS STRETCHED OUT. MAYBE YOU CAN HAVE THAT PLOW NEXT GROWING SEASON. AND DON'T FORGET TO GRAB A SOUVENIR BASKETBALL ON YOUR WAY OUT. [DOOR CLOSES] IS IT TIME TO KNOCK OFF YET? LISTENING TO ALL THESE COMPLAINTS IS THE WORST. GREETINGS, EMPEROR KRONK. HE'S STRETCHING MY CLOTHES. LET IT GO. BUT HE'S STRETCHING THEM. STRETCHY. HEY, GUYS. HEY, DO YOU LIKE WHAT I'VE DONE WITH THE GYM? IT LOOKS JUST LIKE THE PALACE, HUH? EXCEPT FOR THE BASKETBALL HOOP. EMPEROR KRONK, WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME REQUESTS. REQUESTS. GOT YOU. FIRE AWAY. YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE NOTES. HE LIVES FOR THAT. LET HER RIP. Kuzco: WE GET IT, IT'S A LONG LIST. OUR STORY IS BACK OVER THERE. THAT'S A LONG LIST. OH, AND I HAVE 12 MORE. HOLY HOWER MONKEY. [MONKEY SCREECHES] NOT NOW, HONKSLEY, I'M WORKING. AND FINALLY, I NEED A GARGOYLE FOR THE ENTRANCE TO MY NEW SECRET LAB. THE GOOD KIND. DID YOU GET ALL THAT? UH...YEAH. I THINK SO. MY TURN. UH...SHOOT. AND FINALLY, I WANT WORLD PEACE. OR AT LEAST WORLD AGREEMENT TO DISAGREE. GOT IT? MORE OR LESS. YOUR TURN. DO I HAVE... YES! YOU CAN DO IT. THERE. SEE? I BOWED. I'M NOT JUST A HUMBLE VILLAGER, BABY. I'M THE HUMBLEST. AND BY THE WAY, KRONK, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT YOU ARE IN A POSITION OF POWER HERE, BIG GUY, AND YOU GOT CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO THE HARD WORKING VILLAGERS. SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT PUTTING THE GOOD OF THE WHOLE BEFORE YOUR OWN SELFISH NEEDS. I DO? WELL, THAT'S THE WAY I'M GONNA DO THINGS WHEN I'M BACK IN POWER. SO I JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE TO KNOW. NOW, ON TO MY LIST. FIRST, I'D LIKE YOU TO ADMIT YOU'RE NOT THE REAL EMPEROR AND QUIT. STOP. I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE. THIS IS YOUR GIG, KUZCO. YESTERDAY, I LEARNED IT'S HARD TO BE HUMBLE. AND NOT JUST BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY GREAT QUALITIES. BEING A VILLAGER IS TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT. YOU WERE RIGHT, MR. M. EMPERORS DON'T NEED MORE RECOGNITION. EVERYBODY ELSE DOES. SO IN HONOR OF KUZCO TEACHER APPRECIATION DAY, I PRESENT YOU WITH THIS GIFT. OH, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. JUST SAY YOU'LL PAY ME 29.95. ♪ 29 DOLLARS, 29 DOLLARS ♪ ♪ 29 DOLLARS AND 95 CENTS ♪ KUZCO! ♪ IT'S THE END CREDITS ♪ ♪ IT'S THE END CREDITS ♪ ♪ IT'S THE END CREDITS ♪ ♪ LOOK AT THEM GO ♪ ♪ GOSH, THOSE ARE TINY ♪ ♪ I CANNOT READ THEM ♪ ♪ I WISH THAT THEY WERE BIGGER AND SLOW ♪ ♪ WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? ♪ ♪ WHAT ARE THEY DOING? ♪ ♪ IT SHOULD JUST SAY IT'S MADE BY KUZCO ♪ ♪ ALMOST THE LAST ONE ♪ ♪ ARE WE ALL DONE NOW? ♪ ♪ ONLY THING LEFT IS TO SHOW THE LOGOS ♪ [MUSIC CONTINUES]
