 The Emperor's New School (2006–2008): Season 1, Episode 7 - The Lost Kids/The Big Fight - full transcript 
 [I- The Lost Kids] Kuzco is the only available babysitter for Pasha's anniversary spa day, but abuses the bell he was given 'strictly for emergencies' to call Malina's help almost constantly. However Yzma soon causes a real problem. [The Big Fight] Taunting a slow-witted giant once too often gets Kuzco challenged to a hopeless boxing duo. Malina makes Kronk pretend to loose from Kuzco, ignoring why that won't work.

I'VE BEEN A COURAGEOUS ASTRONAUT, A RED-EYED TREE FROG MAN. A SUCCESSFUL MALE MODEL, YEP, LOOKIN' GOOD. BUT THERE'S ONE THING I HAVEN'T BEEN. BABY-SITTER? IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY. WE HAVEN'T HAD A VACATION SINCE THE KIDS WERE BORN. WE'RE GOING TO THE LLAMA SPRINGS CURE-ALL SPA AND GETAWAY RESORT. IT'S OUR ANNIVERSARY. BUT WON'T YOU BE NEEDING A BABY-SITTER? BELIEVE ME, WE LOOKED. CAN'T. IT'S LLAMA LODGE NIGHT! LLAMA-LLAMA-RA-RA IS OUR CHANT! LLAMA-LLAMA-RA-RA! EH, UH, THE REST OF THE CHANT IS SECRET. LOVE TO, SWEETIE, BUT I GOTTA BURN 600 BOW-WOWS AND SLAP 'EM WITH MISSISSIPPI MUD FOR MONDAY'S LUNCH. ME GROUNDED. FIRE NOT MY FAULT. HONEST. [SINGING TO HIMSELF] HUH? OOH! [GRUMBLES] HUH, WE EVEN ASKED THE GUY THAT NO ONE KNOWS. SORRY. I DON'T KNOW YOU. WELL... WHAT ABOUT MALINA? LITTLE MISS HOTTIE? ER, I MEAN, MISS RESPONSIBLE IS PERFECT FOR THE JOB. OH, SHE WAS OUR FIRST CHOICE. OH, BUT TOMORROW'S THE BAKE SALE FOR SAVE THE SLOTHS. OH, SHE'S IN CHARGE OF MAKING POTATO POT PIES FOR THE WHOLE VILLAGE. SO, LET ME GUESS. I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN BABY-SIT THOSE THREE? DON'T WORRY, KUZCO. MALINA PROMISED TO HELP IN AN EMERGENCY. IF THERE'S ANY TROUBLE, JUST RING THIS BELL, AND MALINA WILL BE OVER HERE IN A FLASH. BUT IT'S ONLY FOR EMERGENCIES... RING-A-DING-DING, AND MALINA COMES RUNNING. TO ME. [CHUCKLES] THAT'S LIKE, THE GREATEST THING EVER THOUGHT OF BY ANYBODY THAT THINKS! INSTEAD OF A BELLBOY, IT'S A BELL GIRL! SO REMEMBER, KUZCO, ONLY USE THE BELL AND DISTURB MALINA IF IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY! YOU GOT YOURSELF A BABY-SITTER. OH, WAIT. I SHOULD SAY THAT OUT LOUD, SO SHE CAN HEAR. YOU GOT YOURSELF A BABY-SITTER. AND... THEY'RE... GONE! KUZCO, WHAT IS IT? I HEARD THE BELL. WHAT'S THE EMERGENCY? UM...I THOUGHT I SMELLED SMOKE. AND...I HEARD GHOSTS IN THE WALLS. AND THERE'S JAGUARS IN THE LAUNDRY HAMPER. AHH, YOU RANG THE BELL 'CAUSE YOU JUST WANTED ME TO COME OVER. THAT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY. SURE IT IS. I WAS HAVING A HOTTIE ATTACK. KUZCO, STOP BEING FUNNY. OR TRYING TO BE FUNNY. 'CAUSE THIS ISN'T FUNNY. BABY-SITTING IS SERIOUS WORK. SO DON'T CALL-Y ME UNLESS THERE'S A REAL EMERGENCY, OK? [BELL RINGS] WHAT'S WRONG NOW? WE ARE MISSING A PUZZLE PIECE. YOU NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME. [DREAMILY] I AMAZE HER. HEY, WE NEED MORE ROPE. WHAT? WE'RE OUT OF MAYO. THAT WAS A TEST [ALARM BEEPING] OF THE EMERGENCY MALINA SYSTEM. THAT WAS ONLY A TEST. NOW WHAT? THE KIDS ARE MISSING! WHAT? HOW? WELL, WE WERE PLAYING THIS GAME, IT'S CALLED HIDE AND SOMETHING. [GROANS] KUZCO... CHACA, TIPO, YUPI... OLLIE, OLLIE, OXEN FREE! YOU'RE GOOD. YOU, LIKE, SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE AND EVERYTHING. KUZCO, YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD REALLY IMPRESS ME? HMM... THIS PAINTING I DID OF US? NO! I WAS THINKING MORE LIKE YOU ACTUALLY TAKING CARE OF CHACA, TIPO, AND YUPI. OH! "AND SO THE HANDSOME EMPEROR KUZCO "MADE EVERYTHING BETTER. "AND EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY EMPEROR KUZCO, "LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER. THE END." WOW. MALINA'S GONNA BE IMPRESSED. GOTTA ADMIT THOUGH, BABY-SITTING ISN'T EASY. IT'S LIKE WORK. NOT THE BAD KIND. GOOD KIND. [BELL DINGS] HEY! I'VE ALREADY LEARNED MY BIG IMPORTANT LESSON FOR TODAY. COOL. THIS IS GONNA BE A SHORT EPISODE. [GASPS] OH, NO! WE FORGOT MOM AND DAD'S ANNIVERSARY PRESENT! YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE IT TO THEM. NO, YOU WERE! NO, YOU! NO, YOU! NO, YOU! NO, YOU! NO, YOU! NO, YOU! NO, YOU! YO, KIDDIES! MR. RESPONSIBLE IS BACK. NAPPY-TIME'S OVER. WAKEY, WAKEY, SLEEPYHEADS!

AND YOU'RE NOT JUST PLAYING HIDE AND SOMETHING AGAIN? [SOBS] I WAS FOOLING MYSELF. I'M NOT THE BEST BABY-SITTER EVER. I'M THE WORST! THAT'S WHY THEY RAN OFF. THEY HATE ME. AND I WAS REALLY TRYING. I'M NOT ALL BAD. [SQUALLING] OK, I KNOW. I JUST TIPPED THE SCALE OF SELF-PITY WAY PAST 10. SO TO SPARE YOU ANY MORE OF THAT UGLINESS, I'LL PERFORM THE REST OF THE SCENE WITH... HAND PUPPETS. OH, KUZCO. STOP WORRYING ABOUT POOR LITTLE YOU. YOU GOTTA FIND THE KIDS. EVERYTHING ISN'T ALWAYS ABOUT YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU! YOU'RE SO RIGHT, MALINA. SOMETIMES ALL I CARE ABOUT IS ME, ME, ME!

WHAT CAN I DO TO TOTALLY RUIN KUZCO'S LIFE? WELL, YOU COULD SHRINK HIM. PUT HIM IN ONE OF THOSE SNOWY, GLOBEY THINGS. NAH. TOO SMALL. YOU COULD MAKE HIM GROW UNTIL HE'S BIGGER THAN THE WHOLE PLANET. TOO BIG. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT EASY BEING THE ONE WHO SAYS NO, BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE COMING UP WITH THE IDEAS. IT'S NOT LIKE YOUR NEXT GET-RID-OF-KUZCO PLAN IS GONNA FALL FROM THE SKY! WHAT ARE YOU LITTLE PESTS DOING HERE? MOM AND DAD WENT ON VACATION, AND KUZCO IS BABY-SITTING US. [BELL DINGS] THAT'S IT. I KNOW THE PERFECT WAY TO GET RID OF KUZCO. I'LL BABY-SIT PACHA'S KIDS. THEN THEY'LL LOVE ME, NOT KUZCO. UH... HOW DOES THAT GET RID OF KUZCO? OH, DETAILS! DETAILS! DETAILS! I CAN'T TURN BACK NOW. MY PLAN IS ALREADY IN MOTION.
