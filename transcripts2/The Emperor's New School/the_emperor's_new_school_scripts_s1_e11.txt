 The Emperor's New School (2006–2008): Season 1, Episode 11 - Fortune Cookie Day/Gold Fools - full transcript 
 [I- Fortune Cookie Day] At the Kuzco Academy's exotic foods days, Yzma and Kronk make Kuzco believe fortune cookies always come true, so he'll obey one ordering him to hand her the imperial throne or be transformed into a slimy slug. [II- Gold Fools] Kuzco is too broke to buy a cool toy, and hates chores. Kuzco drags Kronk along to search for a type of gnome that gives gold away. They must accept a partnership with Malina, but the gnome plays a dirty trick.

FEATURING MATA'S FAMOUS SWEDISH MEATBALLS, MATA'S FAMOUS SPANISH RICE, MATA'S FAMOUS BOSTON BAKED BEANS, AND MATA'S FAMOUS... FORTUNE COOKIES? I'LL TRY ANYTHING WITH THE WORD "FORTUNE" IN IT. GROSS. WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT A COOKIE WITH A CHEWY PAPER CENTER? THAT, MR. GOURMET, IS THE FORTUNE. SEE? "YOU ARE SMART, BEAUTIFUL AND WILL CONQUER ALL OBSTACLES." MM, SOUNDS LIKE YOU GOT MINE. HEY, SOMEBODY, NEW FORTUNE COOKIE FOR THE EMPEROR. GOT YOU COVERED THERE, BIG GUY. HERE YOU GO. OH, THANKS, KRONK. "YOU WILL BE SWEPT OFF YOUR FEET BY A HANDSOME HERO." ALL RIGHT, CLEARLY, WE'VE GOT A QUALITY CONTROL PROBLEM HERE. DO I LOOK LIKE A DAMSEL IN DISTRESS? DON'T ANSWER THAT. Kronk: WHAT GIRL? OOF! AHEM. KRONK, I WONDER IF I MIGHT REFRESH YOUR MEMORY AS TO A CHAT WE'VE HAD EVERY NOW AND THEN OVER THE YEARS REGARDING... NO TOUCHY! BUT I SAVED YOUR LIFE. LOOK. THAT WAS CLOSE. YEAH, CLOSE. GUESS THAT MAKES ME A HANDSOME HERO WHO SWEPT YOU OFF YOUR FEET. HEY! IT'S ALMOST LIKE MY FORTUNE CAME TRUE. TALK ABOUT YOUR BARELY INTERESTING COINCIDENCES. COINCIDENCE? MAYBE. OH, BY THE WAY, HERE ARE SOME MORE COOKIES. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH ALL THESE? DON'T ASK ME. ASK THE COOKIES. UH, I GOTTA GO. IT'S ALREADY TIME FOR KUZCO'S DOODLES. THAT'S THE PART OF THE SHOW WHERE I TELL YOU ALL ABOUT MY FORTUNATE FORTUNE COOKIES. LIKE I SAID, I DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE THESE THINGS COULD TELL THE FUTURE, BUT IT COULDN'T HURT TO OPEN A FEW MORE. THE VERY NEXT FORTUNE I GOT SAID, "UNEXPECTED RICHES WILL COME YOUR WAY." AND THEN I FOUND A KUZ-COIN IN THE LLAMA FOUNTAIN. MY NEXT FORTUNE SAID, "GLORY AWAITS YOU ON THE PLAYING FIELD." THEN, I SCORED A GOAL IN GYM... RIGHT PAST SUPER GOALIE KRONK. GOAL! [BEATBOXING] K-U-Z-C-O! KUZCO, KUZCO, GO, GO! [IMITATING CROWD CHEERING] IT WAS THE LAST FORTUNE THAT REALLY GOT ME. IT SAID, "BIG CHANGES WILL COME WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT THEM." [TEETH CHATTERING] THE COOKIES TALKED ABOUT WEALTH, GLORY, AND BIG CHANGES, AND IT ALL CAME TRUE. THESE FORTUNE COOKIES REALLY WORK. UH, YEAH, WEIRD. HA HA! IT'S PERFECT. NOW THAT KUZCO IS HOOKED ON THE COOKIES, IT'S TIME TO DELIVER THE FINAL FORTUNE! YOU KNOW THE ONE I MEAN, KRONK. "A SMILE IS A FROWN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN." NOT THAT ONE! THIS ONE! "TURN OVER YOUR KINGDOM TO YZMA." MMM. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "MMM"? WHAT'S WRONG? WELL, IT'S CLEAR AND DIRECT. I LIKE THAT, BUT, UH... BUT WHAT?! BUT WHAT?! WELL, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE, UH... LIKE, UH... YOU NEED TO GIVE A REASON WHY HE SHOULD TURN OVER THE KINGDOM. KRONK, THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN DOING ALL THIS! THE COOKIES, THE FORTUNES, YOU MAKING THE FORTUNES COME TRUE, SO THAT KUZCO WILL OBEY WITHOUT QUESTION! THIS WAS ALL EXPLAINED IN MY MEMO. YOU DIDN'T LOSE MY MEMO, DID YOU, KRONK? NO, NO!, I, UH... I FILED IT UNDER..."M." BY THE WAY, THE "M" DRAWER'S GETTIN' FULL. HA HA...NOW HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO. DELIVER THE FINAL FORTUNE! [THUNDER] YOU MIND IF I MAYBE GET A BITE TO EAT FIRST? I HAVEN'T EATEN ANYTHING TODAY BUT COOKIES. OK, A QUICK BITE TO EAT, THEN... DELIVER THE FINAL FORTUNE! [THUNDER] ♪ OH...BUP BUP BUP BUP ♪ ♪ BA DUP BA DUP BA DUP ♪ ♪ BA BA DUP, BA DEE BA DO BA DEE ♪ ♪ BAH! ♪ ♪ DEE BA DEE BA DEE BA DEE BA DEE ♪ Kuzco: AND EVERY SINGLE FORTUNE CAME TRUE, LIKE, IMMEDIATELY? ARE YOU SURE IT'S NOT SOME KIND OF TRICK? NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU CAN BE PRETTY GULLIBLE. THANKS. UH...THAT'S LIKE "LOVABLE," RIGHT? YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS. IT'S ADORABLE THAT OUR EMPEROR TAKES ORDERS FROM FORTUNE COOKIES. NO, NO! NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! ALL I SAID WAS THE FORTUNES WERE COMING TRUE. KUZCO DOESN'T TAKE ORDERS FROM ANYONE, ANYTHING, OR ANY COOKIE. [CATAPULT FIRES] "YOU WILL GO TO BED." WELL, GOOD NIGHT. THAT'S NOT EVEN A FORTUNE. HEY, LOOKIE! ANOTHER COOKIE. "TOMORROW AT 5:00, YOU WILL TURN INTO A HAIRLESS SLOTH." WHAT?! NO! SAY IT ISN'T SO, COOKIE! I DON'T WANT TO BE A...A...SLOTH-FACE! ISN'T THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO? HUH? OH, THERE'S MORE? "UNLESS YOU TURN OVER YOUR KINGDOM TO... YZMA"? Malina: YOUR FORTUNE SAID YOU'RE GOING TO TURN INTO A SLOTH AT 5:00 UNLESS YOU TURN OVER YOUR KINGDOM TO YZMA? HAIRLESS SLOTH! AND YOU BELIEVED IT? UHH, TALK ABOUT GULLIBLE. [THINKING] YES! SHE CALLED ME GULLIBLE. THANKS. KUZCO? HMM? READ THIS. "GULLIBLE, ADJECTIVE: EASILY DECEIVED; FOOLISH." YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING YOU READ, MALINA. THEN DON'T BELIEVE THAT FORTUNE. IT'S SO OBVIOUSLY A TRICK. SEE? I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT 'CAUSE THEN I GOT THIS FORTUNE. "IT'S NOT OBVIOUSLY A TRICK." KUZCO, YZMA WROTE THIS. LOOK. WHAT? A LOT OF PEOPLE DOT THEIR Is WITH A SMILING, EVIL YZMA DOT. YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY, REALLY LOVE TO BELIEVE YOU, MALINA, BUT..."DO NOT BELIEVE MALINA." YEAH, I'M SORRY. COOKIES HAVE SPOKEN. NOW I'VE GOT A 5:00, AND I CAN'T BE LATE. HASTA. AAH! MALINA? THAT'S KRONK'S LOCKER. NO WAY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHH! YOU GUYS, I'M TRYING TO HELP KUZCO. [GASP] KUZCO ISIN KRONK'S LOCKER? NO WAY! KUZCO'S A LOCKER LURKER? NO. KUZCO IS NOT IS NOT IN HERE, BUT THE PROOF I NEED MIGHT BE. HMM... LLAMA SADDLE, CHEF'S HAT, BEACH BALL, TAP SHOES? BIRD CALLS OF THE PERUVIAN JUNGLE. AHA! [READING TO HERSELF] I KNEW IT! WHERE IS KUZCO? THE FORTUNE TOLD HIM 5:00. NO RESPECT FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S TIME. HEY, YZMA. GOT YOUR MESSAGE ABOUT DOIN' THE HANDOFF UP HERE. DRAMATIC-- I LIKE IT. SO, AM I, UH, TOO LATE?

WONDERED WHERE I LEFT THAT. I MEAN, I FILED THAT UNDER "M." I MEAN, I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE. UGH... DO YOU NEEDMORE PROOF? OH, MALINA, I KNOW YOU'RE ONLY TRYIN' TO HELP, BUT STUFFING A COOKIE WITH A FAKE FORTUNE TO FRAME KRONK? COME ON. YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT. LET'S GET A MOVE ON, GANG! SUNDIAL SAYS ONLY ONE MINUTE TILL I BECOME AN UGLY SLOTH-FACED THING. WAIT! YOU KEEP SAYING THAT. MOUNTAIN HARVEST TIME STARTED THIS MORNING. OH, THAT'S RIGHT, IT DID.

KRONK, WE'RE GOING TO HUNT FOR SHUAKAS. IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH OUT THERE. WE CAN'T BRING MALINA. UM...WHY? BECAUSE SHE'S TOUGHER THAN YOU, AND SHE'LL MAKE YOU LOOK BAD? NO! IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES SHE GETS KIND OF WEIRD ABOUT SUCCESS, COMPETITION, AND STUFF. OH, YOU MEAN, SHE GETS BOSSY AND OBSESSED WITH WINNING? YES, BUT KEEP IT DOWN. IF SHE HEARS, WE'LL BOTH GET THE "MALINA STARE" FOR SURE. OH, YEAH. HATE THAT. THE STARE. Kuzco: OK, WE HAVE A TRAP, A BACKUP TRAP, AND A BACKUP TRAP FOR THE BACKUP TRAP.

SO, YOU KNOW THE LEGEND, DO YOU? DEE-LIGHTFUL! I'D BE TICKLED TO HONOR THE TRADITION OF SHARING MY GOLD WITH SURFACE-DWELLERS. WHAT FUN! SWEET. ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE THAT IN COINS, BARS, AND GOLD ME STATUES. OH, I'M AFRAID I CAN'T GIVE YOU GOLD. OUR GOLD IS GUARDED BY AN ANCIENT SPIRIT WHO ONLY GIVES GOLD TO THE PURE OF HEART. SORRY. I GOT 20-20 VISION AND ONLY A COUPLE OF CAVITIES. CLOSE ENOUGH? NO. I'M AFRAID YOUR PURITY MUST BE TESTED. BUT DON'T WORRY. I'M SURE YOU'LL DO SPLENDIDLY. BEHOLD! THE CHASM OF PURITY. YOU MUST DESCEND TO ITS DEEPEST DEPTHS AND RETRIEVE WATER FROM THE SPRING OF PURITY. YOU KNOW, TAP WATER ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM SPRING WATER, PLUS, IT'S FLUORIDATED. KUZCO, IF YOU WANT A CART CYCLE, WE NEED TO GET THAT SPRING WATER. YOU'RE RIGHT. WELL, GOOD LUCK, YOU TWO. WHAT? YOU WANT ME TO GO, TOO? ♪ DA DO DO ♪ ♪ DA DA DA DA DA DA DUH DUH ♪ ♪ DA DA DUH DUH! ♪ ♪ DO DO DO, DO DO DA-DA DA DAH! ♪ ♪ HA! HYAH! HYAH! HO! DO DO DO BA-DA BUM BUM... ♪ Malina: KRONK! WHAT? CUT THE THEME MUSIC AND FOCUS! THAT GOES DOUBLE FOR YOU, KUZCO. KUZCO? KUZCO? Kuzco: AAH! [SPLASH] IT'S COLD! THE WATER'S COLD! NOW THAT YOU HAVE RETRIEVED THE WATER OF PURITY, YOU MUST BUILD... A GAZEBO OF PURITY! UH... WHY IS THAT AGAIN? TO PROVE YOU ARE PURE, OF COURSE. CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT. COME ON. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO. YEAH. I THINK I FEEL A "GET UP AND GO HOME" COMING ON. NOT SURE I EVEN WANT A CART CYCLE ANYMORE. WELL, YOU'RE GETTING ONE. I DON'T QUIT, AND NEITHER DOES MY TEAM. NOW STOP JAWING AND START SAWING. AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA BE BOSSY. BOY, WAS I WRONG. Kuzco: IT'S TIME FOR KUZCO'S DOODLES. THAT'S THE PART OF THE SHOW WHERE WE BUILD A GAZEBO. "WHAT'S A GAZEBO?" YOU ASK. SILLY VIEWER. THIS IS A GAZEBO. WAIT. THAT'S A GAZELLE. RIGHT? CAN'T BUILD AN ANIMAL OUT OF WOOD. OK, GET THIS. A GAZEBO'S JUST A PLACE WHERE OLD PEOPLE SIT AND DRINK LEMONADE. HOW BORING IS THAT? I'D RATHER HAVE BUILT A WOOD ANIMAL. BUT NOT MALINA. NO! SHE'S ALL, "STOP BUILDING LLAMAS. START WITH THE NEXT TEST." GUESS SHE HATES ANIMALS. NOW FOR THE FINAL TEST. YOU MUST... TAKE THE SACKS IF PURITY, CONTAINING THE RELICS OF PURITY TO THE RELIC HEAP OF PURITY. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? WHAT ELSE WOULD IT BE? YES, WELL, UM... WHEN YOU ARRIVE, THE ANCIENT SPIRIT WILL DECIDE IF YOU ARE PURE ENOUGH TO RECEIVE GOLD. [SNIFF SNIFF] IS IT ME, OR DOES SOMETHING SMELL LIKE DEAD FISH? NO TIME FOR SMELLING. LET'S GO. [YAWN] HOW ABOUT A QUICK NAP OF PURITY FIRST, HUH? WHO'S WITH ME? THE STARE! THAT STARE DOESN'T SCARE ME. AS MUCH AS IT USED TO. HEY! SHE'S NOT THE BOSS OF US! Malina: I HEARD THAT. THIS IS IT?

BRING ON THE GOLD! YOU KNOW, YOU KIND OF LOOK LIKE GEEZO WEARING A SHEET, ANCIENT SPIRIT? MALINA, I THINK I KNOW A SPIRIT WHEN I-- GEEZO'S THE GREAT SPIRIT? WHY'S HE WEARIN' A SHEET? GARBAGE? THAT'S WHAT SMELLS. WE'RE NOT HAULIN' RELICS. WE'RE TAKIN' OUT THE TRASH. IT'S A SCAM! GEEZO TRICKED US INTO DOIN' CHORES. SO WHERE'S OUR GOLD? IT'S NOT YOUR GOLD! IT'S MINE! YOU CAN'T HAVE IT! CHUAKAS HAVE BEEN TRICKING YOU ROTTEN SURFACE-DWELLERS INTO DOING OUR WORK FOR CENTURIES. HA HA HA! SERVES YOU RIGHT FOR TRYIN' TO STEAL OUR GOLD. YEAH, BUT WE SHOULD GET SOMETHING. I MEAN, WE WORKED ALL DAY. YOU GOT SOMETHING. YOU GOT A LESSON YOU'LL NEVER FORGET. IF YOU WANT SOMETHING, YOU GOTTA EARN IT. Kuzco: NO, YOU'RE NOT DREAMING. I'M REALLY DOING THE DISHES. I FIGURED, IF I'M GONNA WORK, MIGHT AS WELL BE FOR CHICHA. AT LEAST SHE PAYS. NOT LIKE THAT CHEAPSHUKUKA! THE GOOD NEWS IS, I DID THE MATH, AND IF I KEEP DOING CHORES AROUND HERE, I'LL BE ABLE TO BUY A CART CYCLE IN ONLY... 3 YEARS. [PLATES BREAKING] OR MAYBE A LITTLE LONGER. HEY, LOOKIE! ANOTHER COOKIE!
