 The Emperor's New School (2006–2008): Season 1, Episode 1 - Rabbit Face - full transcript 
 Prince Kuzco is heir to the imperial throne, but only if he finishes Kuzco Academy, the capital's regular high-school. Coach Sweetie demands that he participates in a race and wins it otherwise he will be expelled. The race is against no other than Kronk, a gentle giant who, alas, serves Yzma, Kuzco's evil and boundlessly ambitious rival for the throne. Kuzco worries only about Malina, his classmate, and the cheers for Kronk, until he finds out that everybody thinks he will lose. Yzma intends to eliminate any risk by using an elixir to turn Kuzco into a turtle, but instead Kronk mixed one which transforms the prince into a bunny.
