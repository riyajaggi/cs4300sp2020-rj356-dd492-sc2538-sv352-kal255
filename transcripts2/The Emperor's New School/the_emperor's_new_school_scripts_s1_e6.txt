BUT ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT FOR SURE. LET KRONK ASK HER. EASY! UH, MALINA, ARE YOU OK? WHAT? YOU THINK I'M NOT OK, THAT I'M UPSET? WELL, I'M NOT. I WOULD BE UPSET IF CHEERLEADING WAS A BIG PART OF WHO I AM. BUT IT'S NOT. EVEN IF IT WAS, THAT A- IS A MISTAKE. AND WHEN IT'S FIXED, WE'RE GONNA LAUGH AT IT, RIGHT? HA-HA! OK, GOOD TALK.
