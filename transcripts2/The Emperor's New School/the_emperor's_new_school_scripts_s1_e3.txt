OH, RIGHT, THE ANNUAL SCHOOL DANCE. THE DANCE NAMED AFTER YOU. COMBINING YOUR NAME KUZCO WITH THE WORD DISCOTHEQUE, THUS GIVING US THE CLEVER NAME KUZCOTEQUE. THAT KUZCOTEQUE? EXACATACKILY.

WHEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAME IN... WOW. SHE IS SUCH A HOTTIE-HOT-HOTTIE. SOMEDAY, AFTER WE GRADUATE, MALINA WILL BE MY REAL EMPRESS. SHE'S SO PERFECT. PERFECT HAIR, PERFECT LIPS, PERFECT EYES. IT'S GONNA BE A PERFECT KUZCOTEQUE. YAMALLAMA! IS THAT A ZIT? IT IS! IT'S A ZIT! A PIMPLE! IT'S RUINING MY PERFECT PERFECTION. HUH! SHE'S TALKING TO YOU. WHAT'S SHE SAYING? UH, I CAN'T STOP LOOKING AT IT! BE CAREFUL. CAREFUL. DON'T SAY IT OUT LOUD. DON'T SAY IT. YOU HAVE A ZIT! OOPS. OK, YES, EAGLE EYE, I HAVE A SMALL BLEMISH. IS THIS GONNA THROW OFF YOUR GROOVE? NO, NO, I'M SURE ZIT WON'T. I MEAN ZIT WON'T. IT--ZIT-- WON'T BE A-- IT WON'T BE A PROBLEM. HA HA HA! [SIGHS] YOU ARE SO SUPERFICIAL. WOW. SHE CALLED ME SUPER...SOMETHING. BUT THEN SHE WALKED AWAY. CUCKOO. SORRY TO INTERRUPT SO EARLY IN THE SHOW, BUT I GOTTA KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS SUPER THING. ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE HERE. UM... OK, HERE IT IS. "SUPERFICIAL." "NOT PROFOUND. SHALLOW." SHALLOW? ME? WHOA, WAIT A SECOND. I'M NOT SHALLOW. I'M NOT A ZITOPHOBE. IN FACT, I MEAN, MALINA'S ZIT IS JUST ONE TINY, LITTLE SKIN BLEMISH. I MEAN, OVERALL, SHE'S STILL VERY MUCH A HOTTIE. BUT THE POINT IS, IT'S A FLAW. SEE, AS EMPEROR, I CAN'T HAVE ANY OF THOSE FLAW THINGS. BAD FOR THE REPUTATION. AND IF MY EMPRESS HAS A FLAW, THEN SO DO I. AND BY THE WAY, WOULD YOU EAT THIS? OK, OK, LET'S GET ON WITH IT. WOW, KRONK. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO HELP ME OUT WITH THIS ZIT THING. HEY, I'M TOTALLY WITH YOU ON THAT FLAWLESS THING. PERFECTION IS ITS OWN REWARD, THAT'S WHAT MA SAYS. ALSO, "STOP THAT, OR IT'S BACK TO THE CIRCUS." GOOD TIMES, THE CIRCUS. BUT CAN YOU REALLY MAKE A ZIT-DESTROYING POTION? WELL, IT'S NOT SO MUCH A POTION AS IT IS AN ELIXIR. YOU SURE YZMA-- I MEAN PRINCIPAL AMZY-- ISN'T AROUND? YEAH. I'M SURE. PULL THE LEVER, KRONK! Man on P.A.: PLEASE SCREAM LIKE GIRLS UNTIL THE RIDE COMES TO A COMPLETE STOP. [BOTH SCREAMING] WHOO! Man over speaker: WELCOME TO SECRET LAB. TAKE YOUR ORDER? SECRET LAB BURGER. NAH. THIS IS PERFECT, PERFECT, PERFECT! STEP ONE--CONCOCT A MAGIC POTION TO DESTROY MALINA'S ZIT. Kronk: ELIXIR. ELIXIR. WHATEVER. STEP 2--APPLY SAID ELIXIR TO SAID BLEMISH. STEP 3-- BOOGIE UNTIL DAWN. OW! BOOGIE WOOGIE OOGIE BOOGIE BOO! WHOO-HOO! HEY, KRONKSTER, WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG WITH THE ELIXIR POTION THINGY? COMING UP. [PUFFS] THAT IT? YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT. WELL, THANKS AGAIN. BYE-BYE. YEAH, SEE YOU. YOU, UH, GONNA NEED THE EMPTY BACK? NAH, YOURS TO KEEP, BUDDY. REALLY? YOU SURE? HMM, SEEMS SO STURDY, YOU KNOW? LIKE, UH, PROFESSIONAL GRADE. IT IS, IT IS. I BUY 'EM IN BULK AT THE OUTLET. AH. I SEE. HMM. COME ON, COME ON, COME ON. WHEW. THOUGHT HE'D NEVER LEAVE. THAT POOR, GULLIBLE FOOL. HE REALLY THINKS HE'S GETTING HELP FROM KRONK. BUT I'M YZMA. MAMA PERU! DID I JUST UNSCREW MY HEAD OFF, AND I'M YZMA? OHH, I WISH I COULD SEE HIS FACE-- OR, RATHER, HER FACE-- WHEN HE SPRAYS THAT ELIXIR ON MALINA. YZMA! ME! BUT--CAN'T. IMPOSSIBLE! AAH! AAH! OHH! AAH! MAKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, MONKEY. MAKE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I DON'T WANT TO BLOW MY OWN HORN HERE, BUT THIS MAY BE THE CLEVEREST IDEA I'VE EVER HAD. I'M SORRY ABOUT THE ZIT THING. HERE IS SOME PERFUME. CLEVEREST IDEA EVER. PERFUME? [COUGHS] WHAT IS THAT? YUCK! UH,EAU DU ELIXIR. IT'S FRENCH. HEY! IT WORKED! ZIT IS GONE! ZIT NO MORE. MY FLAWLESS PERFECTION IS SAVED. [WOLF HOWLS] HOLD IT-- YOU'RE HOWLING IN YOUR HEAD, AREN'T YOU? ALL RIGHT. WHAT DID YOU JUST DO? AAH! YOU'RE A TOUCAN FACE! [LAUGHING] THAT WASN'T PERFUME. IT WAS SOME WEIRDO POTION! ELIXIR, ACTUALLY. WHAT? NO ONE WILL NOTICE A ZIT IF I HAVE A GIANT FREAK BEAK? NO, I WANTED TO TURN YOU INTO A BIRD. [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] PRETTY BIRD. MALINA WANT A CRACKER? HA HA! [CHATTERS] Kuzco: YOU GAVE ME A PHONY ELIXIR. IT ADDED A BEAK INSTEAD OF SUBTRACTING A ZIT. YOU'RE TRYING TO RUIN MY PERFECTNESS ON PURPOSE. HOW DID YOU FIND ME? WAIT-- DID YOU SAY I GAVE YOU AN ELIXIR? NO, NO. DON'T PLAY DUMB. WITH YOU, THAT COULD TURN THE UNIVERSE INSIDE-OUT. YEAH, BUT I CAN'T MAKE AN ELIXIR. I CAN BARELY DO POTIONS. WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WAIT, I DIDN'T UNSCREW MY HEAD OFF AND WAS YZMA UNDERNEATH, DID I? YEAH, THINK I'D REMEMBER THAT. IT'S JUST--ELIXIRS, THAT'S SO YZMA. OH! HERE I COME AGAIN! HEH! UNH. EWW. YZMA'S EVEN UGLIER WHEN SHE'S FUZZY OUT-OF-FOCUS. AAH! WRONG! WRONG! FUZZY'S BETTER! FUZZY'S BETTER! WAKEY, WAKEY, YOUR HIGHNESS. DID YOU HAVE A NICE NAP? GOOD. BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DIFFICULT CHOICE TO MAKE. CHOICE ONE-- YOUR BELOVED MALINA REMAINS A BIRD-FACED FREAK OF NATURE. HA HA HA! AND SHE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER WHO DID THAT TO HER-- YOU. CHOICE 2-- I HAVE THE ANTIDOTE. YOU GIVE IT TO HER, AND SHE RETURNS TO NORMAL. [CACKLING] HMM, I'LL TAKE CHOICE NUMBER 2. WAIT, YOU CAN'T. I FORGOT-- YOU GIVE IT TO HER, AND SHE RETURNS TO NORMAL. BUT THERE IS A PRICE FOR THE ANTIDOTE. LET ME GUESS--I LET YOU BECOME EMPRESS. NOT EVEN CLOSE. YOU LET ME BECOME EMPRESS. OK, YOU WERE CLOSE. WELL, I STILL TAKE CHOICE NUMBER 2. SURE, I'LL LOSE THE KINGDOM, BUT THIS ONLY HAPPENED BECAUSE I'M SUPERFICIAL. NOW MAYBE MALINA WILL THINK I'M JUST SUPER. SIRE, NO! YOU MUST NOT GIVE YZMA THE KINGDOM! SHE WOULD BRING NOTHING BUT SORROW. BUT THEN I HAVE TO GO TO THE DANCE WITH FREAKY BEAK GIRL! WAH-HAH! SO, COME ON, IS IT A DEAL? YOU GONNA HAND OVER THE ANTIDOTE, OR JUST STAND THERE DECOMPOSING? YOU GOT IT! [CACKLING] [LULLABY PLAYING OUT OF TUNE] CAREFUL-- THAT'S NOT YZMA, THAT'S ME. I THINK. I SAW ME BE HER EARLIER, SO SHE'S PROBABLY ME NOW. I'M WILY LIKE THAT. OR SHE IS. IT'S TOO CONFUSING. I COULDN'T LET IT GO ON. THE BANANAS ARE THE MONKEY'S. AND THAT'S PROBABLY NOT BEAK ANTIDOTE. BETTER LET ME TEST IT. YEP, WHAT'D I TELL YOU? SHE-ME WAS GOING TO DOUBLE-CROSS YOU. WILY. OH, JOY. TOMORROW'S LUNCH SPECIAL. YIPES! COME BACK. YOU CANNOT GET AWAY FROM ME. OK. HMM. WELL, AS FOR YOU. NO ANTIDOTE, NO KINGDOM. DEAL'S OFF. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [KUZCO WHISTLES] WHO'S A PRETTY BIRD? YOU'RE SO NOT FUNNY. WHAT? OH, DON'T TELL ME-- EAU DU ELIXIR? YEAH. HA HA! SORRY I TURNED YOU INTO SCARY BEAK-FACE GIRL. AND THIS IS YOUR WAY OF MAKING IT ALL BETTER-- GIVE YOURSELF A BEAK TOO? IT'S BOTH SHALLOW AND TOUCHING. THANKS. I THINK. SO NOW WE'RE BOTH STUCK LIKE THIS. YEAH, FOR NOW, BUT WE'LL BE BACK TO NORMAL AFTER THE BREAK. YOU REALIZE A TOUCAN BEAK IS A FLAW, RIGHT? UNLESS YOU'RE A TOUCAN. WELL, THE WAY I SEE IT, TRUE PERFECTION IS IMPOSSIBLE. SO I GET AS CLOSE AS I CAN. I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS, EVEN WITH THE TOUCAN BEAK, I THINK YOU'RE SUPER.
