 The Emperor's New School (2006–2008): Season 1, Episode 9 - Unfit to Print/The Emperor's New Pet - full transcript 
 [I- Unfit to Print] Kuzco only wants to read about himself and Mr. Moleguaco feels that Malina's school paper articles are boring - so Kuzco is made editor in her place. When she scolds his invented stories, he decides to make his craziest feat come true, the first-ever landing on the moon. She stops him in time, alas witnessed by readers. [II- The Emperor's New Pet] Moleguaco makes the kids learn responsibility by taking care of kittens. Kuzco dumps his 'Homework', but takes it back to land a play-date with Malina's Fluffy after Yzma fed Homework an elixir to become a black jaguar.

UH, BUCKY BOY IS TRUE. HE IS! HERE'S WHAT OTHERS HAVE TO SAY. I LUH-OVED READING ABOUT BUCKY BOY. IT WAS INSPIRING AND IT HAD LOTS OF HEART, TOO.

KUZCO WRITE GOOD--EVEN GOODER THAN MALINA. KUZCO, I THOUGHT THIS WAS SOMETHING I WOULD NEVER SAY, BUT...GOOD JOB. FOR ONCE I DIDN'T FALL ASLEEP HALFWAY THROUGH THE FIRST STORY.

BUT COUNT ME OUT. UH, HEY THERE, SORRY FOR THE PAUSE THINGY, BUT, UH, I GOT A LITTLE PROBLEM HERE. LET'S LOOK AT THE SCORE. FIRST OFF, MALINA'S MY FRIEND. SECOND, IT WAS HER GREAT IDEA THAT I PUBLISH MY OWN SCROLL. THIRD, SHE STUCK BY ME EVEN WHEN I BUMPED HER OUT OF A JOB. NUMBER 4, SHE CAME UP WITH THE BEST STORY YET. AND ON TOP OF THAT SHE'S A HOTTIE. HOT HOTTIE. HOTTEST HOTTIE. IN ALL OF HOTTIE-DOM. HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT. HOT. SO SHE'S GOT LIKE... WELL, THAT'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF ON HER SIDE. YEAH, SEVERAL OF THEM ARE HOTTIE, BUT THAT STILL COUNTS. SHE'S THAT HOT. NOW, MEANWHILE OVER IN COLUMN "K." ONLY THING I'VE DONE IS... TURN HER INTO A LIAR. HMM...STILL, THAT'S BETTER THAN BEIN' TURNED INTO A LLAMA. RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, BACK TO "SAD" ME. SO, NOW WE'VE COME FULL CIRCLE, TOLD YOU IT WOULD ALL MAKE SENSE. YOU SEE, IF I FLY TO THE SUN, THEN MALINA WON'T BE A LIAR. KUZCO, YOU CAN'T FLY TO THE SUN. WELL, MAKE UP YOUR MIND. NOW YOU'RE OK WITH BEING A BIG FAT LIAR?

WELCOME TO MY SUNNY SOLAR KINGDOM. OH, GOOD, YOU BROUGHT SUNGLASSES. [SINGING SURF MUSIC] Malina: AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR MALINA'S DOODLES. THAT'S THE PART OF THE SHOW WHERE I SHOW KUZCO WHAT WOULD REALLY HAPPEN. OK, SO HERE'S THE OUTER SPACE AND THE STAR STUFF AGAIN. AND HERE COMES THE EMPEROR'S EXPRESS. WHAA! THE END. YOU'RE SURE THERE'S NO 40-FOOT SUN GODDESS LADY? YES... WHOA...HE'S REALLY FLYIN' TO THE SUN. KUZCO RULES! 'COURSE HE IS, MALINA SAID HE WAS. SHE ALWAYS TELLS THE TRUTH. UH...THAT DIDN'T RULE SO MUCH. NOPE... ANYONE UP FOR PIZZA? EH...THANKS, MALINA. GLAD I WASN'T ON BOARD. WHAT?! YOU WEREN'T ON BOARD? KUZCO'S STILL HERE? YOU RULE! KUZCO ALIVE. GREETINGS, HAPPY TO SEE ME PEASANT PEOPLE. HEH HEH HEH. MWAH! MWAH! KISSY, KISSY, KISS, KISS. WHAT IS GOING ON? WE SAW YOU CRASH INTO A BILLION PIECES. YEAH, HOW COULD YOU BE ALIVE? WELL, YOU KNOW ME, I WAS TOTALLY ALL ENGINES, FULL BLAST. BUT A SECOND BEFORE LIFT-OFF-- UH-OH--I WAS ATTACKED BY SLOTHS. THAT'S RIGHT, SLOTHS. YOU KNOW, THOSE THINGS ARE FAST. ANYWAYS, I FOUGHT THEM TOOTH AND NAIL, NAIL AND TOOTH, TOO, BUT THEY OVERPOWERED ME. FORCED ME TO ABANDON SHIP. SO...I...PICKED UP MY KUZCO RAY--PSZZEW! AND, I, UH...

AND IT'S ALL TRUE. UNLIKE SOME STORIES. BUCKY BOY IS TRUE. MWAH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA! Announcer: BUCKY BOY DISCOVERS ATOMIC NUT! K-U-Z-C-O, KUZCO, KUZCO, GO, GO! THOUGH I'D LIKE TO THINK GRADUATING FROM KUZCO ACADEMY WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH BOUNDLESS OPPORTUNITY, THE TRUTH IS YOU'RE LIKELY TO END UP AS LLAMA HERDERS, SO YOU ALL NEED TO LEARN RESPONSIBILITY. EACH OF YOU WILL BE TAKING CARE OF A KITTEN. WHICH MEANS YOU'LL BE DOING THINGS LIKE BRUSHING IT. TURTLE SHELL COMB. FEEDING IT. SARDINE PUFFS. PLAYING WITH IT. GO FISH. AND EVEN NAMING IT. I'M GONNA NAME HER LITTLE YZMA 'CAUSE SHE REMINDS ME OF HER WHEN SHE GOT TURNED INTO A KITTY. MEOW. THAT WAS FUNNY. THE KITTY THING. KUZCO, I'M WAITING. FOR WHAT, MR. M? FOR YOU TO TRY AND FINAGLE YOUR WAY OUT OF ANOTHER ASSIGNMENT. OH, THAT'S OK. ME NO FINAGLE. TAKE CARE OF A KITTY. NO PROBLEM. AHH... MEOW. HMM...LET'S SEE. BRUSH YOU, FEED YOU, PLAY WITH YOU... NAME YOU. OK, YOUR NAME IS HOMEWORK. SEE YOU LATER, HOMEWORK. MEOW. HI THERE. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. HOW COULD I PUT CUTE LITTLE HOMEWORK IN THERE? WELL, THINK ABOUT IT. ME TAKE CARE OF ANOTHER LIVING THING? BELIEVE ME. HOMEWORK'S MUCH SAFER NOW. BESIDES, WITH ALL THAT FOOD AND STUFF, THAT PLACE IS LIKE A KITTY CONDO. LOOK, THE REAL BAD GUY HERE ISN'T EVEN A GUY AT ALL. SHE'S A...WHAT IS SHE? AN YZMA. TO THE NOT SO SECRET LAB, HA HA! [CACKLING] TALK ABOUT AN EASY PEASY OPPORTUNITEESY. IF KUZCO CAN'T TAKE CARE OF HIS KITTY, HE'LL FAIL, AND I BECOME EMPRESS! NOW LET'S SEE...HOW SHALL I DO IT? FIRST, I'LL SACK NAP HIS KITTY. THEN, I'LL PUT THAT KITTY ON A SLOW BOAT TO CHINA. ONCE THE KITTY'S IN CHINA I CAN PAY IT A VISIT, AND STAY IN A NICE HOTEL AND GO SOUVENIR SHOPPING, AH, HA HA HA HA! BRILLIANT! EH... WHAT, YOU DON'T LIKE IT? EH-EH. NAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. WHY SPEND ALL THAT MONEY ON SOUVENIRS WHEN I CAN JUST GIVE THE KITTY THIS? HEY, KUZCO, WHERE'S YOUR KITTY? KITTY? OH, FUNNY STORY. YOU SEE, AFTER I BRUSHED AND FED LITTLE HOMEWORK-- THAT'S WHAT I NAMED HIM. A VICIOUS GANG OF BUTTERFLIES AMBUSHED HIM. THAT'S RIGHT. SNATCHED HIM AWAY LIKE A HAWK. EXCEPT THEY WERE BUTTERFLIES. BIG ONES. GUESS IT'S NOT THAT FUNNY AFTER ALL. ACTUALLY, IT'S QUITE TRAGIC. YEAH, RIGHT. YOU BETTER NOT HAVE JUST DUMPED HIM SOMEWHERE. BECAUSE THAT'S TOTALLY IRRESPONSIBLE. HE HAS FOOD. KUZCO... Kronk: ♪ ROCK-A-BYE KITTY, LITTLE YZMA ♪ ♪ I'LL DO ALL I CAN TO REALLY PLEASE YA ♪ ♪ IF YOU GET HUNGRY I WILL FEED YA ♪ ♪ THEN YOU'LL BE HAPPY I WILL BE, TOO... ♪ SEE, KUZCO, THAT'S WHAT KITTY CARE IS ALL ABOUT. HA HA--KRONK'S LIKE A MOMMY. MOMMY KRONK. UGH, IF ONLY YOU WERE HALF THE MOMMY HE IS. Kuzco: GEE, THANKS FOR THE VISUAL. [BABY BURPS] A GOOD EMPEROR NEEDS TO KNOW NOT ONLY HOW TO BE TAKEN CARE OF, BUT ALSO HOW TO TAKE CARE OF OTHERS. CAN YOU SEE WHAT A STUPID THING IT IS-- UH-OH...MALINA HAS THAT "I'M NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT KUZCO" LOOK. ME NO LIKEY THAT LOOKY. AND SECONDLY, YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT I'M NOT SO CRAZY ABOUT AN EMPEROR WHO CAN'T THINK OF ANYONE BUT HIMSELF. SO I WANT YOU TO GO RIGHT BACK INTO THE SCHOOL-- CAN'T BE TALKIN' ABOUT ME, CAN SHE? WHAT IF SHE IS? UH, 'SCUSE ME, MALINA, I'VE GOT A KITTY TO TAKE CARE OF. MEOW. I'M BACK, LITTLE HOMEWORK. COME TO PAPA KUZCO. [GROWLS] [ROARS] YIPE! NICE KITTY? Kuzco: IT'S TIME FOR KUZCO'S DOODLES. THAT'S THE PART OF THE SHOW WHERE I SHOW OFF MY AWESOME DRAWING SKILLS. SO HOMEWORK MUST HAVE EATEN ALL THE FOOD I LEFT IN THE LOCKER 'CAUSE HE GREW INTO A BIG KITTY. WITH BIG TEETH. SHARP TEETH. AND SHARP CLAWS. SO HERE'S ME BEFORE I BRUSHED AND FED AND PLAYED WITH HOMEWORK. AND HERE'S ME AFTER I BRUSHED AND FED AND PLAYED WITH HOMEWORK. OUCH. THIS DEFINITELY WASN'T WORKING OUT. IT'S NOT THAT HARD, KUZCO, IN FACT, I LIKE IT. FULFILLIN' THE NEEDS OF LITTLE YZMA IS A JOY FOR ME. IT--IT MAKES ME COMPLETE.

VITAMINS, EXERCISE, AND A LITTLE THING I LIKE TO CALL KUZCO'S TENDER, LOVIN' CARE. I DON'T KNOW, THIS JAGUAR THING SMELLS LIKE YZMA. ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T SMELL LIKE HER AT ALL. THAT'S JUST AN EXPRESSION. LIKE, "I'M SO HUNGRY I COULD EAT A LLAMA," BUT COULD ANYONE REALLY EAT A WHOLE LLAMA? COME ON. THE THOUGHT REPELS ME. [MEOW] THAT AND THE THOUGHT THAT ANYTHING BUT YZMA SMELLS LIKE YZMA. UH, PLEASE TELL ME THAT YOUR KITTY'S NOT GONNA EAT FLUFFY. OK? SIMMER DOWN, MALINA. HOMEWORK'S AS TAME AS A PUSSYCAT. LOOK-- WHOO! HA HA--THAT WAS GREAT, KUZCO, YOU SHOULD WIN TOP PRIZE. IF THERE WAS A PRIZE. BUT THERE ISN'T A PRIZE. SORRY. I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU, KUZCO. LET'S JUST HOPE MR. M'S GONNA BE PROUD OF YOU, TOO. I'VE TRULY LEARNED HOW TO TAKE CARE OF OTHERS. SO, I GUESS THIS IS GOOD-BYE. I'M GONNA MISS YOU. YOU'RE THE BEST HOMEWORK I'VE EVER HAD. EXCELLENT ACTING, KUZCO, BUT THIS ISN'T THEATER CLASS. I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO FAIL YOU. HUH? THIS ISN'T YOUR KITTEN, IT'S A JAGUAR. [GROWLS] MEOW. YOU WERE SAYING, MR. M? UH, OK, YOU PASS. MEOW. OH!
