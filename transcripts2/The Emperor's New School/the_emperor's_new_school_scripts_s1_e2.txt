I THOUGHT THIS WAS ALL ABOUT ME. HEH HEH! SPELL MY NAME AGAIN! K! U! Z C O! KUZCO! KUZCO! GO, GO! Teacher: ALL RIGHT, NOW TRADE YOUR SQUIRREL LANGUAGE QUIZ WITH YOUR NEIGHBOR. IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT I TRUST YOU TO CHECK EACH OTHER'S WORK, I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO IT MYSELF. [CLEARS THROAT] SO…WHO CAN TRANSLATE QUESTION ONE: SQUEAK SQUEAKEN SQUEAK SQUEAKER? OH, OH, I KNOW, MR. MOLEGUACO. IT MEANS, WHERE DID I BURY MY ACORN? CORRECT! OH, GOOD JOB THERE, KUZCO. YOU GOT QUESTION NUMBER ONE RIGHT. OF COURSE. I'M A SMART GUY. OK. QUESTION 2: SQUEAKEN SQUEAKER SQUEAK SQUEAK. I KNOW. IT MEANS, LOOK OUT. YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE HIT BY A CART. OHH! YOU PUT, "WHERE DID I BURY MY ACORN?" AGAIN. EH. HEY, YOU PUT IT FOR QUESTION NUMBER 3, TOO. AND QUESTION NUMBER 4… AND QUESTION NUMBER 5. WOW, KUZCO, YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW YOUR SQUIRREL SQUEAK. AND THAT STOPPED ME FROM… FROM PASSING. ONE OUT OF FIVE IS NOT A PASSING GRADE. IT'S ONLY 20%. WHAT? WE'RE IN MATH NOW? I THOUGHT THIS WAS SQUIRREL LANGUAGE SKILLS. KUZCO, SEE ME AFTER CLASS. OHH… YEAH, BUT SQUIRREL SQUEAK IS COMPLETELY USELESS. WHAT? LIKE I'M GONNA SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE BY GOING SQUEAKY SQUEAK SQUEAK? I DOUBT IT. YOU JUST SAID, GO AHEAD. JUMP IN THE SHARK TANK. AS EMPEROR, YOU MIGHT FIND THAT KNOWING A SECOND LANGUAGE CAN COME IN HANDY. AS A MATTER OF FACT… Kuzco: WELCOME TO THE SHORTY McGABS-A-LOT SHOW. THIS WEEK SHORTY DRONES ON AND ON ABOUT LEARNING ANOTHER LANGUAGE. DOESN'T HE KNOW THAT'S WHAT THE ROYAL TRANSLATOR'S FOR? HELLO?! YOU KNOW, I BET I WOULD LOOK REALLY SHARP IN A COWBOY HAT. KUZCO! HMM? WHAT? OH, YES. VERY INTERESTING. [SIGHS] IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO ME IF YOU FAIL. OR THAT YZMA BECOMES EMPRESS AND HER OPPRESSIVE, TORMENTING REIGN HURLS US INTO A WHIRLPOOL OF FAMINE AND DESPAIR. HEY, IS A WHIRLPOOL THE SAME AS A HOT TUB? SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS… PASS ME BECAUSE I GOT ONE RIGHT? NO. I'M ASSIGNING YOU A PRIVATE TUTOR… BUCKY THE SQUIRREL! TA-DA! YOU KEEP A SQUIRREL IN YOUR DESK? YOU WILL SPEND 24 HOURS WITH BUCKY. YOU WILL LIVE, BREATHE, AND EAT SQUIRREL SQUEAK. EEW! TOMORROW, YOU RETAKE THE TEST, AND I STRONGLY SUGGEST YOU PASS. [SQUIRREL SPEAK] THAT'S A MANGO. [SQUIRREL SPEAK] NO. MANGO. MAN-GO. HEY! YOU LOUSY LITTLE-- [GASPS] MELINA! KUZCO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HUH? OH. JUST GETTIN' LUNCH. BUCKY THE SQUIRREL? HA HA. WHAT, ARE YOU TODAY'S SPECIAL? [SQUIRREL SPEAK] UH…HE SAYS THAT YOU SHOULD START LIKING ME MORE AND BECOME MY EMPRESS. NO, MR. MULTI-LINGUAL. HE SAID YOU SLAMMED A LID ON HIS HEAD. ECCH. I HEARD YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LEARNING FROM HIM, NOT TRYING TO COOK HIM. HERE. IT'S MY ENGLISH-SQUIRREL DICTIONARY. START USING IT. SAY, UH, MAYBE YOU COULD COME OVER LATER AND CHECK ON MY PROGRESS? ASK ME IN SQUIRREL SQUEAK. HUH? OH. UH… "SQUEAK-SQUEAKER… "SQUACK… SQUEAKEN-SQUOIK." OHH… CL-OSE ENOUGH. WE'VE GOT A STUDY DATE. SEE YA BOTH LATER. LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE MY KEY TO MELINA, BUCKY. MIGHT BE WORTH LEARNING A SECOND LANGUAGE AFTER ALL. WE MUST ELIMINATE THAT SQUIRREL! WITH BUCKY OUT OF THE PICTURE, KUZCO WILL FAIL THE TEST AND THE KINGDOM IS MINE! YEAH, LADY, THIS WON'T GO OVER TOO WELL WITH YZMA. SHE'S KINDA GOT DIBS ON THE… "KINGDOM IS MINE" DEAL. IAM YZMA. [SCREAMS] HAVE YOU BEEN HER ALL THIS TIME? TO THE SECRET LAB! PULL THE LEVER, KRONK! TAKE THE STAIRS? HEY, WHY NOT? OHH… LET'S SEE. WHAT CAN I USE TO ELIMINATE BUCKY? OH, I KNOW! SLEEP-INDUCING FR-UIT! HA HA HA HA! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! WHAT IS IT? I LIKE BUCKY. DON'T HURT THE LITTLE SQUEAKER. HE'S GOT A FUZZY TAIL. HE'S CUTE. BUT IT'S ONLY A MAGIC SPELL. HE'LL BE ASLEEP… TEMPORARILY. YEAH, WELL, I DON'T WANNA CROSS THAT LINE. YOU'LL HAVE TO DO IT ON YOUR OWN. MAGICAL FRUIT? THAT'S JUST ASKIN' FOR TROUBLE. RRR. OH, FINE! NAH, TOO BIG. TOO HARD. TOO MONKEY. TOO WICKED-WITCHY. OH! TOO PERFECT. HMM. WITH EVERYBODY GONE CANOEING, NOTHING CAN MESS UP MY STUDY DATE. SNAGIKA? EXCEPT YOU. AND NO, I DON'T WANT A MANGO. OH, I MEAN SNAGIKA. AI. AI. ALGIDY. GEE, THANKS. HEY! MELINA'LL BE HERE ANY SECOND. YOU BEHAVE, OR ELSE-- STOP IT! HOW DO YOU SAY "STOP IT"? WAIT. WHAT AM I DOING? I KNOW HOW TO USE THIS DICTIONARY. UH-OH. [BOING] OW! HEY, HEY, WHAT DID I SAY? COWBOY HAT? TOTALLY WORKS. [YZMA CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [BELCH] HEY, BUCKAROO, CHECK IT OUT. OH, NO! BUCKY! [THINKING] UH-OH. DID I JUST-- [KNOCK ON DOOR] OH, NO! MELINA! KUZCO? UH…ONE SECOND! [SQUEAK SQUEAK SQUEAK] [WHIMPERS] MELINA… WHAT A SURPRISE. YOU INVITED ME. OH. RIGHT. COOL. WHERE'S BUCKY? UM, HE'S…ASLEEP! UPSTAIRS. YEAH. HE TAUGHT ME A FULL SQUIRREL VOCABULARY, SO NOW HE'S NAPPING. OK, THEN. HOW ABOUT A LITTLE PRETEST BEFORE YOUR RE-TEST? LET'S TALK ONLY IN SQUIRREL. UM… OK… GOOD. AHEM. SQUEAKY-SQUEAKEN, GOGA SQUEAK. YEAH? WELL, SQUEAKEN-SQUEAKER SQUEAK SQUEAK. YOU JUST SAID I'M ABOUT TO BE HIT BY A CART. UH, NO, WAIT. UM… I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. [PANTING] SQUEAKEN GAGO, SQUEAKEN-SQUEAKY. REALLY? OH, WELL, IN THAT CASE… GA SQUEAKEN BOBA SQUEAKITY. UH… WON'T BE A MOMENT. SQUEAKITY SQUAK-SQUEAK SQUEAKEN SQUEAK. SQUEAKITY SQUEAK-SQUEAK, SQUE-VANA-SQUIK. SQUIBABA-SQUEAKEN. SQUIBBITY BANA SQUOKEN. SCHMEE SQUITTY GOO SQUEAKEN-SQUEAK! UH… WAIT RIGHT HERE. A-HEM. HI! YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED ANYTHING FROM BUCKY, HAVE YOU? AND WHEREIS BUCKY? DON'T KNOW. I THOUGHT HE WAS NAPPING UP HERE, BUT, UH… THERE HE IS! HI, BUCKY! DON'T WAKE HIM UP! AW…ITTY CUTIE BITTY SLEEPY. HE'S NOT ASLEEP! THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM. HE'S FINE. YOU'RE GONNA WAKE HIM UP. LET GO! NO, YOU! STOP IT! YOU STOP IT FIRST! IT'S TIME FOR KUZCO'S DOODLES! THAT'S THE PART OF THE SHOW WHERE YOURS TRULY DRAWS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. SO I PULLED BUCKY. THEN MELINA PULLED HIM. THEN I PULLED, AND MELINDA LET GO. AND BUCKY WENT "WEE!" OUT THE WINDOW. BUH-BYE. THEN HE BOUNCED DOWN THE HILL-- BINK, BOINK, BOINK, OUCH-- AND LANDED RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ONE OF THOSE…ROAD THINGIES. AND THEN, JUST MY LUCK, A CART…FILLED WITH MANGOES! MELINA WAS ALL, "OH, NO, MANGO CART!" I WAS ALL, "I'M ON IT, MELINA," THE HOTTIE-HOT-HOTTIE. OH, MAN. LOOK AT ME GO! WHOO-HOO! THEN, WELL… OK. I'M STUCK. [MOANING] [MUTTERING] BUCKY! YOU'RE OK. LISTEN, GET OUTTA THE WAY! A CART FULL OF MANGOES IS ABOUT TO SQUISH YA! STUPID SQUIRREL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND PEOPLE TALK! YEAH, THIS LOOKS PRETTY BAD. BUT GET READY… THIS IS RIGHT WHERE YOUR FAVORITE EMPEROR'S IMPRESSIVE LANGUAGE SKILLS TOTALLY PAY OFF. ALSO, I'M KING OF THE TREE STUMP! ALL HAIL TO STUMP KING! [IMITATES BUGLE] [GIGGLES] TREE STUMP.
