 The Emperor's New School (2006–2008): Season 1, Episode 5 - Cart Wash/Battle of the Bots - full transcript 
 [I- Cart Wash] At the annual KuzCart Wash, even the emperor-to-be must raise money for charity by humbly washing car(t)s, in Pasha's case drenched in lama dun. Malina actually cares, and Kuzco for her. Yzma hopes he'll fail for this extracurricular school activity, so she tries to sabotage it. [II- Battle of the Bots] On the Kuzco Academy's annual Inventions day, originality is key. As inspiration fails, Kuzco decides to break into Yzma's lab and steal some crazy 'inventions' for himself and Malina, but she refuses to steal anything, as that's cheating.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS ALL ABOUT ME. HEH HEH! SPELL MY NAME AGAIN! K-U-Z-C-O! KUZCO! KUZCO! GO, GO! THIS WEEKEND IS THE ANNUAL CART WASH FUND-RAISER FOR CHARITY. EACH STUDENT MUST OPERATE A CART-WASHING STAND WHERE HE OR SHE WILLWORK. ANY QUESTIONS? KUZCO. OF COURSE. YOU SAID I SHOULD ASK WHEN YOU USE WORDS I DON'T UNDERSTAND. [SIGHS] WHAT ARE THEY THIS TIME? CHARITY AND WORK. HE DIDN'T HAVE TO THROW THE DICTIONARY AT ME. HELPING OTHERS MAY BE SOMETHING AN EMPEROR DOESN'T UNDERSTAND, BUT THE ACADEMY DOES THIS EVERY YEAR. YOU WORK, THEN YOU GIVE THE MONEY AWAY? HUH. NO WONDER YOU PEOPLE ARE PEASANTS. I MEANPLEASANT. YOU PEOPLE ARE PLEASANT. BECAUSE... I'D RATHER BE A SELFLESS PEASANT THAN A SELFISH EMPRESS. WHOA, YOU WANT TO BE MY EMPRESS. BACK UP. KUZCO, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO FOR THE ASSIGNMENT IS RAISE 100 KUZ COINS. THAT'S IT? 100 ME COINS? KUZCO FEDERAL, KUZCO SAVINGS AND LOAN, KUZCO BAIL BONDS. AH, BANK OF KUZCO. [SING-SONG] ACCESS TO ROYAL FUNDS IS DENIED. YOU MUST PASS ALL SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS WITHOUT ROYAL HELP. WHAT AN ANNOYING LITTLE MAN. AND WHAT'S UP WITH THAT HAT? SO, ANY CUSTOMERS YET? UH...YOUR FEET ARE IN THE BUCKET. OH, I'M SOAKING THEM. I HAD TO WALK ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK AND BACK. WHAT'S WITH THE STALE BREAD? THAT'S A SPONGE. YOU DIP IT IN THE SOAPY WATER, AND SOMEBODY BRINGS A CART BY, AND YOU WASH IT... [THINKING] WOW, MALINA IS SO CUTE. HERE'S A GREAT SONG ABOUT HER. ♪ MALINA, YOU'RE A CUTIE ♪ ♪ YOU'RE THE TUTTI OF MY FRUTTI ♪ ♪ A-DO-DA-DO-DA-DOODY ♪ ♪ A-DOODY-DA-DA-DO ♪ UH, OK, THAT WASN'T SO GREAT. ACTUALLY, IT WAS DOWNRIGHT EMBARRASSING. SORRY ABOUT THAT. AND THAT'S HOW YOU WASH A CAR. ANY QUESTIONS? UM, SO THIS DEFINITELY ISN'T BREAD? [CHUCKLES] MAKING KUZCO WORK FOR CHARITY... IT'S BRILLIANT. THERE IS NO WAY LAZYBONES KUZCO WILL BE ABLE TO EARN 100 KUZ COINS, AND SOON I WILL BE EMPRESS. AH HA HA HA HA! YOU SENT FOR ME, PRINCIPAL AUNTIE. KRONK, HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU? IT'S ME--YZMA. WOW, IT'S JUST SO GOOD, I ALWAYS FORGET. HERE, I'LL FIX THAT. I AM ZZs, MY AM ZZs, MY AM ZZs. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MEMORIZING THROUGH AM ZZs BY REPETITION. I AM ZZs, MY AM ZZs... OH, STOP IT AND COME WITH ME. WE'RE GOING TO PAY OUR FAILING FRIEND KUZCO A VISIT. OH, YOU GUYS ARE GETTING ALONG NOW. THAT'S GREAT. NO, NO, HE'S NOT OUR FRIEND. BUT YOU JUST SAID HE WAS. WELL, HE'S NOT. THEN WHY ARE WE PAYING HIM A VISIT IF WE DON'T LIKE HIM? IT'S AN EXPRESSION. AND WE HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS VISIT? HE'S GOING TO FAIL, AND WE ARE GOING TO BE THERE TO WITNESS IT. NOW COME ON. AM ZZs, MY AM ZZs, MY AM ZZs, MY... IT'S TIME FOR KUZCO'S DOODLES. THAT'S THE PART OF THE SHOW WHERE YOURS TRULY DRAWS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. SO I OPENED UP MY CART-WASHING STAND. THIS IS IT. AND THAT'S ME. AND THAT'S STALE BREAD. NEXT, SOME OLD GUY BROUGHT IN A DIRTY CART. HE WAS SHAPED LIKE A...PEANUT. HA HA. THAT'S GOOD. SO PEANUT MAN WAS LIKE, "HEY, YOU, WASH MY CART," AND I'M LIKE, "YOU COULD SAY PLEASE, PEANUT MAN." AND HE WAS ALL, "I DON'T LOOK LIKE A PEANUT," AND HE DROVE OFF ALL MAD. BYE-BYE. COME AGAIN. PROBLEM IS, HE DID COME AGAIN, AND HE BROUGHT ALL HIS PEANUT SIBLINGS. OF COURSE, I DEFEATED ALL OF THEM WITH MY KUNG-FU ACTION. [KARATE YELLS] SAY, I WONDER HOW MALINA'S DOING. LET'S GO SEE. GOOD JOB, KIRI. HEY, KOOKSIE, BRING IN THE NEXT CART. HEY, MALINA, HOW'S CART WASHING WORKING OUT? I GOT BEAT UP. WE'VE ALMOST REACHED OUR GOAL. REALLY? BUT HOW'D YOU... OH...I GET IT. [WOLF WHISTLE] NICE SUIT. IT'S FOR CHARITY. IF YOU SAY SO. CHARITY. HUMPH. CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GONNA LOSE MY ENTIRE KINGDOM OVER 100 LOUSY KUZ COINS. AAH! HEY, WHY DON'T YOU WATCH WHERE YOU'RE GOING, YOU-- YOU BAG OF SHINY KUZ COINS. 1, 2, 3, 4... HMM, HMM, HMM, 95. 95 KUZ COINS?! HMM, WHAT SHOULD I DO? YOU CAN'T KEEP THAT MONEY. IT BELONGS TO SOMEONE ELSE. 2 WORDS--FINDERS KEEPERS, LOSERS WEEPERS. THAT'S 4 WORDS. THEY'RE HYPHENATED. AREN'T YOU GUYS, LIKE, ON THE WRONG PERSON'S SHOULDERS? WE'RE FREE-LANCING. IT'S AN OUTREACH PROGRAM. HEY, I'M GETTING PAID. YOU WANT TO DO CHARITY WORK, THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. FELLAS, I'M EMPEROR. HELLO... YEAH, I'LL TRY AND FIGURE THIS OUT ON MY OWN. 95 KUZ COINS? THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S, UH... 5 KUZ COINS A CART... ONE MORE, HE PASSES. I DO NOT BELIEVE IT. WELL, YOU DIDN'T SEE HIS OUTFIT. OHH, THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE. UH-HUH. KUZCO, IT'S ALL GONE. KIRI LOST OUR MONEY ON THE WAY TO TURN IT IN, ALL 95 KUZ COINS. HAVE YOU SEEN IT? PLEASE TELL ME YOU'VE SEEN IT. OK, WE'RE GONNA SPLIT UP AND LOOK FOR THE MONEY. WE'LL NEVER REACH OUR GOAL IF WE HAVE TO START OVER. UH, HI THERE. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. HOW COULD I KEEP THE KUZ COINS AND LET MALINA FAIL? WELL, IT WASN'T AN EASY DECISION, AND I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE IMPLICATIONS TO MY ACTIONS, SO, LET'S LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. BECAUSE I KEPT THE MONEY, I'LL PASS THE ASSIGNMENT AND EVENTUALLY BE REINSTATED AS EMPEROR. MALINA WILL BECOME MY EMPRESS, AND WE LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER WITHOUT EVER WORKING AGAIN. YAY! FOLLOW MY THINKING? THEN MALINA FINDS EVIDENCE THAT I STOLE THE KUZ COINS. SHE GETS REALLY MAD, AND I END UP IN JAIL. HUH, I DIDN'T THINK OF IT THAT WAY. NO, NO, NO, SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH THESE CHARTS. SOMEBODY FIRE THE ROYAL CHARTMAKER. YOU'RE FIRED. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING TO GET AN "F." MY WHOLE LIFE IS RUINED. IT'S JUST ONE ITTY-BITTY "F." OOH, I'M A TINY LITTLE "F." I'M NOT SO BAD. HUH? RIGHT? I'VE NEVER GOTTEN AN "F." TELL YOU WHAT-- I'LL HELP YOU RAISE THE MONEY. WHAT ABOUT YOUR OWN GRADE? NO, NO, NO, THIS IS ABOUT YOU, NOT ME. YOU. NO ME. YES, YOU. AND IT'S ALSO NOT ABOUT ANY POTENTIAL JAIL TIME. LET'S SEE, WHAT CAN WE USE TO MAKE SURE KUZCO DOESN'T WASH ONE MORE CART? AH... HOW ABOUT THIS? IF KUZCO CHEWS ONE OF THESE, HE'LL BLOW A PINK SPHERICAL BUBBLE THAT WILL EXPLODE AND CAUSE HIS FACE TO GET ALL STICKY. IT'S BRILLIANT. ISN'T THAT, UH, BUBBLE GUM? [GLASS SHATTERS] THEN WE'LL USE THIS... TO TURN HIM INTO AN ELEPHANT. HA HA! THEY DON'T HAVE HANDS, SO THERE'S NO WAY HE CAN WASH A CART. WAAH HA HA HA HA! GET YOUR CART WASHED BY A REAL EMPEROR--ME. HELPING OUT MY FRIEND, RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. UH, KUZCO? ONLY 5 KUZ COINS. KUZCO... ALL FOR CHARITY. KUZCO! AAH! OH! OH, HEY YA, PACHA. WAY TO SNEAK UP ON A GUY. I HEARD ABOUT YOU WORKING, FOR CHARITY. I'M IMPRESSED. JUST TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AT LEAST ONCE TODAY. WELL, MAYBE I CAN HELP. I BROUGHT MY CART BY FOR A WASH. GREAT. BUCKET'S OVER THERE, STALE BREAD OVER THERE, AND WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED, GIVE YOURSELF A BIG TIP. UH, KUZCO... UH, ALL RIGHT. HEY YA, KUZCO. MUST BE A LOT OF WORK. ALL THAT WORK PROBABLY "WORKED" UP QUITE A THIRST, HUH? HA HA HA. PARCHED. EHH... OH. OH...THIS SODA I'VE GOT IS REALLY THIRST-QUENCHING. IT'S A DELICIOUS FLAVOR. OH? WHAT FLAVOR'S THAT? YOUR FAVORITE FLAVOR. YOU MEAN IT'S... EXACTLY. IT'S... YES. LEMON-LIME? HA HA HA! LEMON-LIME. PART LEMON, PART LIME. LEMON-LIME. KUZCO'S FAVORITE. HAVE A DRINK. UH...WHAT? I DON'T KNOW. I WAS HAVING A DELICIOUS LEMON-LIME SODA, AND NEXT THING I KNOW, I'M A BIG STINKY ELEPHANT. HOW'S AN ELEPHANT SUPPOSED TO WASH CARTS? NO HANDS. HEY, DO YOU KNOW HOW ELEPHANTS CLEAN THEMSELVES? YEAH, NOT VERY WELL. GET A WHIFF OF ME. WHEW! THEY USE THEIR TRUNK. HEY, I GOT AN IDEA. [AROO!] LOOK AT ME! I JUST WASHED YOU! BOOM BAM! JUST LIKE THAT. OW! OOH, CHECK THIS OUT. [SPLASHING] [BLOWING] HEY, GOOD WORK, KUZCO. I BELIEVE I OWE YOU... 5 KUZ COINS?! I KNOW IT'S NOT MUCH, BUT IT'S ALL I MADE. HOPE IT HELPS. I'LL EXPLAIN THE WHOLE ELEPHANT THING LATER. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU ACTUALLY WORKED, AND NOW YOU'RE GIVING THE MONEY AWAY? YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW, HELPING YOU HAS DEFINITELY CLEARED UP THIS WHOLE CHARITY THING. THE WAY I LOOK AT IT, I'D RATHER BE A SELFLESS EMPEROR THAN A SELFISH ONE. OH, THAT'S SO SWEET. [KISS] BUT WE FOUND OUR MONEY. SOMEONE-- I'M NOT SAYING WHO-- KIRI! LEFT IT ON ONE OF THE CARTS TO BE CLEANED. OK, SO YOU DON'T WANT IT. YOU NEEDED 5 MORE KUZ COINS, RIGHT? REALLY? KEEP IT. YOU EARNED IT. YEAH, I DID, DIDN'T I? I EARNED IT. THAT MAKES 100 KUZ COINS. HA HA! I DECLARE THIS ASSIGNMENT... PASSED. ♪ OOH, YEAH, PASSIN' THE CLASSIN' ♪ ♪ MM-HMM, UH-HUH ♪ ♪ UH-HUH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH ♪ OOPS. HEH HEH. SORRY. FORGOT ABOUT THE ELEPHANT THING. OOH! I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN HIM THAT BUBBLE GUM. BY THE WAY, WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT 95 KUZ COINS I GAVE YOU FOR MY CHIN WAX? UH...RIGHT. ♪ KUZCO, KUZCO, GO, GO ♪ THAT'S RIGHT, CLASS, THE ANNUAL INVENTION FAIR IS ALMOST HERE. AS I'VE SAID, PARTICIPATION IS MANDATORY FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GRADUATE. OR BECOME EMPEROR. ENJOYING YOUR COMIC SCROLL, KUZCO? WHY, YES, MR. M. THANKS FOR ASKING. KUZCO! WHAT? I ALREADY HAVE MY INVENTION. IT'S CALLED THE NO TALKEE MACHINE. ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE. KRONK, WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FOOD? OH, BOY. TOUGH ONE. SPINACH IS A FAVORITE, HAZELNUT SOUP. OH, RIB ROAST WITH MANGO CHUTNEY-- [MUFFLED] EUREKA. IT WORKS. COOL INVENTION. CAN I TRY IT? [MUFFLED] QUIT IT! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? IT'S MY INVENTION. YEP. FEELS LIKE A WINNER TO ME. PEOPLE, I HAVE TEACHER THINGS TO PRETEND TO DO. SO REMEMBER, IT'S AN INVENTION FAIR. THAT MEANS IF YOU ENTER SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS, YOU'LL FAIL! HUMPH. YES, KRONK, I'M REFERRING TO THE BUCKET. OHH, HOW AM I GOING TO FIND AN INVENTION AS HANDY AS THE BUCKET? OH! NO, KRONK, THE RAG HAS ALSO ALREADY BEEN INVENTED. WELL, I'M TAPPED OUT. [RING RING RING] ALRIGHTY, TIME TO INVENT. INVENTION IDEAS, HERE WE GO. NEED AN IDEA. ANY IDEA WILL DO. NEED AN IDEA. COME ON, IDEA. I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE. THIS FAKE BEARD IS NOT HELPING. SORRY. IT ALWAYS HELPS ME. YOU KNOW, YZMA HAS A SECRET LAB. IT'S FILLED WITH INVENTIONS. MAYBE YOU SHOULD BUILD YOURSELF A SECRET LAB. THAT'S IT! REALLY? YOU'RE GONNA BUILD A SECRET LAB? IS THAT PRACTICAL? NO. I'LL JUST BORROW ONE OF YZMA'S INVENTIONS. NO ONE WILL KNOW. HI. I'M NO ONE. HAVE WE MET? YOU SAID NO ONE WILL KNOW. SO IF I'M NO ONE, THAT MEANS I'LL KNOW. COME ON, WORK WITH ME, GUYS. OH, YEAH, BUT THAT'S OK, 'CAUSE YOU'D NEVER TELL ANYBODY 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GET IN TROUBLE 'CAUSE YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT ME. DON'T YA? LITTLE BIT? YOU WERE SO WRONG SO MANY TIMES THERE, I LOST COUNT. KUZCO, USING ONE OF YZMA'S INVENTIONS IS CHEATING. AND YOUR POINT IS... CHEATING IS WRONG, YOU'LL FAIL CLASS, YZMA WILL BECOME EMPRESS-- PICK YOUR FAVORITE! BESIDES, INVENTING ISN'T THAT HARD. IT'S DEFINITELY EASIER THAN BREAKING INTO YZMA'S LAB. THANK YOU, MALINA. YOU'VE TURNED ME AROUND. I NOW SEE THE ERROR OF MY WAYS. I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT BREAK INTO YZMA'S LAB ANYTIME SOON. NOPE. HELLO. [GASP] OH, MALINA. DIDN'T, UH... WHERE DID YOU... ISN'T THIS A LOVELY OFFICE? YOU KNOW, I HEARD SOMEWHERE THAT CHEATERS REALLY DON'T PROSPER. RIGHT. WHAT DOES PROSPER MEAN, AGAIN? CHEATERS NEVER THRIVE? NOT HELPING. CHEATERS ALWAYS FAIL. WOULD A PICTURE HELP? NO, NO, NO. I GOT IT NOW. FORTUNATELY, I'M NOT CHEATING. I'M BORROWING. AAH! AAH, AAH... HMM. MUST BE OUT OF SECRET LAB COSTUMES. WHOA. LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF. KUZCO, THIS IS A BAD IDEA, EVEN FOR YOU. WE SHOULD LEAVE. Kuzco: WOODBOT. LOVE IT. I BET WOODBOT HERE GETS ME FIRST PRIZE IN THE OLD INVENTION FAIR. HOW ABOUT WE GIVE THIS BAD BOT A TEST DRIVE? UH, HOW ABOUT WE DON'T? HOLD IT! THERE'S SOMETHING JUST LIKE THIS IN MY COMIC SCROLL. I KNEW READING THESE THINGS WOULD PAY OFF. OK, I DIDN'T. HERE'S AN IDEA-- WHY DON'T YOU IGNORE ME AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT? SOUNDS GREAT. BE RIGHT WITH YOU. [SQUEAKING AND CREAKING] THAT SHOULD DO IT. I THINK. [MOTOR REVVING UP] YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M STARTING TO THINK CHEATING MIGHT BE A BAD IDEA. IS NOTHING SACRED ANYMORE? YOU! AND HERE I THOUGHT THIS COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE. HOW DID YOU GET DOWN HERE? YOU MUST BE AT LEAST THAT TALL TO RIDE THE SECRET LAB COASTER. OH. I THOUGHT YOU WERE SHORTER. [BRAKES SQUEAL] [MOTOR RUNNING] AAH! IS THAT MY WOODBOT?! IS THAT WHAT THAT IS-- A WOODBOT? HMM. YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY, I DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE IT UNTIL JUST NOW. [ROAR] [CRASH] OK, I ADMIT IT. I WANTED TO STEAL ONE OF YOUR INVENTIONS TO ENTER THE INVENTION FAIR AND MALINA TRIED TO STOP ME, THEN I ACTIVATED THE WOODBOT, HE WENT BERSERK, AND NOW WE NEED YOUR HELP TO STOP IT OR-- WAIT.YOU MADE MY WOODBOT WORK? YES, THAT'S RIGHT. SO, YOU TRIED TO CHEAT AND NOW YOU NEED MY HELP OR YOU'LL FAIL. HA HA HA HA! WHY SHOULD I HELP YOU? I'M GOING TO SIT BACK AND ENJOY THIS. [CRASH] COME ON! YOUR INVENTION JUST WENT PUBLIC. [THINKING] HEY, MALINA'S TOUCHING MY ARM. THAT MUST MEAN SHE LIKES ME. Kuzco: HE'S HEADED FOR THE SCHOOL! SOMEONE HAS TO STOP IT! I SECOND THAT. I NOMINATE YOU. WAIT. "YOU" IS ME. I CAN'T STOP THAT THING. THAT THING WOULDN'T BE OUT THERE IF YOU HADN'T TRIED TO CHEAT. BESIDES, YOU STARTED THE WOODBOT. IF ANYONE CAN STOP IT, IT'S YOU! YEAH, BUT... HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT. I DID START HIM. WHY WOULDN'T I BE ABLE TO STOP HIM? ISN'T THAT WHAT I JUST SAID? ICAN DO THIS. I'VE BEEN READING COMIC SCROLLS FOR YEARS. TO STOP THE WOODBOT, I'LL BUILD SOMETHING EVEN BIGGER AND STRONGER. I'LL BUILD A... A LEAFBOT! Malina: TRY AGAIN. FEATHERBOT? [MALINA IMITATES BUZZER] AH-CHOO! ROCKBOT? PERFECT. YEAH, A ROCKBOT! BUT THERE'S NO TIME. YOU GET TO WORK, I'LL STALL THE WOODBOT. WAIT. WHY ARE YOU HELPING ME? WELL, IT'S NOT BECAUSE I LIKE YOU, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. [THINKING] SHE SAID, "I LIKE YOU." MM-HMM. YOU HEARD HER. I'M NOT MAKING THAT UP. IT'S TIME FOR KUZCO'S GOOD OLD... DON'T THINK I CAN BUILD A ROCKBOT? WELL, GET READY TO BE WRONG, 'CAUSE I'M SMARTER THAN I THOUGHT I WAS. AFTER CONSULTING BUCKY BLASTOFF, ISSUE NUMBER 107, I CARVED EACH ROCKBOT PIECE OUT OF SOLID ROCK. [CLANKING] OK. IT WASN'T SO SUPER-STRONG. HMM. FORTUNATELY, MOMENTS LATER, I FOUND AN UNUSUAL ROCK FORMATION. I ADDED PULLEYS, SPRINGS, GEARS, AND MY MUSIC BOX-- I MEAN, CHACA'S MUSIC BOX. I DON'T HAVE A MUSIC BOX. WHY WOULD I HAVE A MUSIC BOX? HA HA. AND VOILA! ROCKBOT! NOW, IF MALINA CAN JUST STALL THE WOODBOT LONG ENOUGH FOR ME TO MAKE THIS THING WORK, WE'LL BE ALL SET. [BRAKES SCREECH] SORRY. EXACT CHANGE ONLY. [TIRES SCREECHING] YOU KNOW, THE SUPERVISOR'S GONNA DOCK YOUR PAY FOR THAT GATE. 2 HOURS AGO THEY SAID IT COULDN'T BE DONE. THEY WERE WRONG. WRO-ONG! KUZCO, THE WOODBOT ALMOST HERE. CAN YOU, LIKE, MOVE IT ALONG? RIGHT. I PRESENT... THE ROCKBOT! [GRUNTING] YEAH. THE COVER THINGY'S STUCK. HERE, I'LL FIX IT. NO, I CAN DO IT. NOW IT'S CAUGHT IN THE BACK. LOOK, JUST LET ME-- NOW YOU GOTTA PULL IT THIS WAY. NO, YOU PULL IT THIS WAY. KRONK, WOULD YOU JUST--AAH! NO, THAT WON'T WORK. GO, ROCKBOT! SHOW 'EM WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF! HE'S, UH... MADE OF ROCK. GO, WOODBOT! WHAT? I'M NOT ALLOWED TO CHEER? [CHEERING] UH-HUH! WHOO-HOO! WA-HOO! YEAH! WHOO-HOO! GO, TEAM. HURRAH! ALL RIGHT! GRRRR! AND THE WINNER OF THIS YEAR'S INVENTION FAIR IS... KUZCO'S ROCKBOT. [CHEERING] THANK YOU. THIS RIBBONY THING MEANS A LOT TO ME. AND AS A-- NO NEED FOR AN ACCEPTANCE SPEECH, KUZCO. BUT THAT'S JUST IT. I CAN'T ACCEPT IT. YES, I BUILT THE ROCKBOT. YES, I'M A SCIENTIFIC GENIUS. AND, YES, I'M TOO CUTE TO BE THIS SMART, BUT... BEFORE I DISCOVERED I WAS A GIFTED INVENTIONER, I...I TRIED TO CHEAT. WHOO! THERE, I FEEL BETTER. YOU KNOW, MAYBE I CAN ACCEPT THIS RIBBON NOW. NO, YOU CAN'T! BUT, SINCE YOU CONFESSED ON YOUR OWN, WHICH IS EVEN MORE SURPRISING THAN THE FACT THAT YOU ACTUALLY INVENTED SOMETHING, I'M NOT GONNA FAIL YOU. PROVIDED YOU WRITE AN ESSAY ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF CHEATING. 1,000 WORDS. CAN WE MAKE IT 500? 750? 1,000. 1,000! DEAL. 1,000 IT IS. AND THAT MEANS FIRST PRIZE NOW GOES TO KRONK FOR HIS INVENTION-- THE BUCKET HANDLE. [CHEERING] I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE I'VE EVER MET. BY NAME. LET'S GET STARTED. THANKS, MOM. THANKS, POPPY. THANKS... Kuzco: SO, IT ALL WORKED OUT. I LEARNED MY LESSON, KRONK WON FIRST PRIZE FOR HIS... BUCKET HANDLE, AND MALINA FELL MADLY IN LOVE WITH ME. [KISSING SOUNDS] OK, MAYBE THAT LAST PART'S NOT TRUE. BUT I DID GET A COOL NEW BUTLER. FOR ABOUT 8 MINUTES. THANKS, MRS. PETERSON. YOU MADE THOSE YEARS IN HIGH SCHOOL...SO SPECIAL. I REALLY THINK I GOT OFF TO A GOOD START. AND MR. PEDRO IN KINDERGARTEN. THAT TIME WE MADE TURKEYS OUT OF OUR HANDPRINTS. Kuzco: YEP, THAT'S THE ROYAL CHARTMAKER. I'M NOT COMPLETELY HEARTLESS, SO I HIRED THE LITTLE GUY BACK. SEE, I GOT THIS IMPORTANT CHART I NEED MADE, SORT OF A "KUZCO'S THE GREATEST AND NO ONE CAN EVER COMPARE TO ME" KIND OF CHART. THEN AGAIN, DOESN'T EVERYONE ALREADY KNOW THAT? IN WHICH CASE, WHAT DO I EVEN NEED A CHART OR CHARTMAKER FOR? ANSWER: I DON'T! YOU'RE FIRED.
