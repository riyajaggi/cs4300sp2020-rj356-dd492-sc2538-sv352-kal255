 ♪ Put it on my tab ♪ ♪ Whatever the cost ♪ ♪ I'm good for it ♪ Oh! Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin! Justin! Didn't you say you had an early morning? No, I said I had a late night. Hurry, Katarina. You don't want to be late. Be right there. Hey, it's me again. Where are you? You're 20 minutes late for the first session. Just call me back, okay? - Hey. - Hey. That was an amazing layback out there. - Thanks. - Look... I wanted to say no hard feelings about the whole Justin thing. Oh, I noticed you were having some trouble with your overhead lift. Yeah. Pair skating is just so much different than singles. I know. I get it. The first time I did a lift, I was terrified. I mean, you're pretty high up there. It's easy to psych yourself out. Piece of advice... just don't look down. Okay. Oh, look who decided to show up. My new partner gets here soon, so I should probably warm up. Well, good luck. You too. You're making friends with the competition now? I must have looked lonely since my partner was late. Well, I'm here now. Just get on the ice. I'm already warmed up. Don't worry. I warmed up plenty last night. Twice, actually. Ew. Some girls actually like it when I lift them in the air. Okay, you two. Enough. Less talking, more skating. Where were you? Why are you late? As my coach used to say to me, "If you want to do, skate. If you want to don't, leave." Three weeks in, and she hasn't let me lift her once. Do you really think an extra 20 minutes is gonna make a difference? Wow. All right. Now, this time you will do it. All right? Now, lean forward, just like we practiced off the ice. Come on. Before he lifts you, and... Argh! Argh! How many times are we gonna not do this? I mean, this is just the first lift. There's still the carry lift, the star, the loop, the lasso, the boomerang. Okay, I made that last one up, but still... Look, I know, okay? I'll get it. If this is ever gonna work, you need to relax. I just need a minute, okay? Take all the time you need. Wake me up when you're ready. I'll be right here. Oh, good news. Your femur... is recovering faster than expected. So what does this mean for Regionals? You know, I'd rather you take a break from skating altogether, but... if you keep up this regimen and manage not to reinjure yourself, there's a good chance you'll be able to compete. Fuck, yeah! This is gonna be my year! - Thank you! - All right. Yup. Yeah. It'll be great. On Saturday night, I'm having this thing, so... Hey. Dasha wants us back in. Gabe, Kat. Kat, this is Gabe, Leah's new partner. I've been beating this guy since before his balls dropped. Classy. But speaking of, I should probably go before Leah chemically castrates me. Again. Apparently, she's hired some big choreographer from Michigan, so I will see you tomorrow tonight. And Kat, it was a pleasure meeting you. What's tomorrow night? Nothing. This is Bruce. All right. I've got your song for your short program. It's Coldplay. Ugh! I'm just kidding! No, I'm serious. Oh, my God. Look at your faces! No, seriously, this time, let's take that energy and use it for when I do pick your music. Get to it, girls. What? I love him. - He's expensive, right? - Very expensive. That's all I needed to know. Good! Now straighten up. Argh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Is he okay? - What the fuck, Kat? - Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. - Honey, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. This isn't working. Jesus. I could have killed him. Justin will be fine. Accidents happen, Katarina. Hey. Hey. Is Mom here? Not yet. She's coming straight from work. It's okay. I'm okay. Just, um... Just a little stressed. You know? Just... with work and... basically learning how to skate all over again. I'm just... just a little... overwhelmed. Are you taking your lithium? Yeah. Promise. And the propranolol. But not that speed stuff that that stupid doctor gave you, right? Because that shit can trigger mania. I'm not manic. Promise. Just... kind of the opposite. Lithium makes me feel like I'm... moving through water. So... how's it going with Justin? It's... going. How about you? I feel like I haven't seen you in forever. I'm actually kind of great. Uh, training's going really well. All my new coaches are awesome, especially Mitch. He just gets me. He thinks I have a real shot at Nationals. That's great. Mom's been really cool about stuff lately. Mitch got her to agree that it's time to age up my program to something more mature or whatever. No more Gershwin, thank God. Whoa. Where's the rest of that leotard? Is this new look Mitch's idea, too? Can you stop with that? It's just a leotard. I should go. Mom's gonna freak out if I'm not on the ice when she gets here. I'm fine, really. I'll see you later. - That looked intense. - Yeah. Did you see what Mitch has her wearing? She might as well be skating in a bikini. I've worn less. Exactly. Look, can you just... can you keep an eye on her for me when I'm not around, just in case? You're overreacting. But yes. I'm too good to you. - Morning, ladies. - Hey! Hey! Eat that shit, and it'll go straight to your tits! - Good luck rotating your jumps then. - Mom, seriously? Carol. Serena, why don't you go and warm up, and give me and your mom a minute to chat. I'm sorry. Serena knows she's not allowed to eat muffins. If you have concerns about Serena's nutrition, you and I can discuss that in private. Understood? Good. And remember, Serena's not the only one on a trial period. Can you believe him? Talking to me like that about my own daughter. Well, he is the coach. I haven't had a muffin since the morning of my senior prom. I'm just trying to look out for her physique, okay? 'Cause her dad's DNA is going to do her no favors. Never had to worry about this shit with Kat. What? Do I have blueberry in my teeth or something? No, honey. It's just Kat had a rough morning. She fell. - Well, is she okay? - She's fine, but she could have killed Justin. - I heard he might need stitches. - Yeah. Yeah. ♪ In-between the photos when I wake by you ♪ ♪ In the night-time... ♪ Five-dollar tip on a fifty-dollar bill? Great. It's not like I'm exhausted or anything. No! Shit! Sorry! It's okay. - Ugh! It's fine. I got it. - It doesn't mean I can't help you. - You're too kind to me. - You're probably right. I should probably charge you for all of this glass you just broke. It's okay. I'll just deduct it from your paycheck. Marcus, w... Uh, I really... That's not funny. Look, I know things have been a little... weird between us, but can we just, I don't know, just be cool again? Yeah. Let's just be cool. Cool. ♪ It's the night-time that's bothering me lately... ♪ Hey, now that we're cool, I guess I can ask you how skating's going. It's going. I stayed to skate pairs, and... Don't get me wrong. I'm glad I did. Sometimes I just feel like I don't know what the hell I'm doing. Well, I don't know anything about skating, but it is called pairs, right? So, by definition, it's not all on you. That's the problem. My partner's great. He knows exactly what he's doing. He's experienced and confident. Then there's me, - a walking disaster. - Hey. Come on. You've only been doing this a few weeks. Just keep at it, and you'll catch up. What's the worst thing that can happen? Is Justin gonna drop me? You're home late. - I worked a double. - Oh. I made golubtsy. Leftovers on the table, but don't be too loud. I'm trying to watch my game show reruns. I'm good. I ate at work. I know Justin's frustrated with me, but... every time I even think about being up in the air, I just freeze and... - Is he gonna drop me? - Of course not. He's stronger than you think. I don't mean physically. I mean as his partner. I know what you mean. He's not going anywhere. I think you need to go sleep. You'll feel better in the morning, I promise. This is the boys' room. I don't care. Go! I wish you were that warm and fuzzy with me. You get warm and fuzzy when you stop acting like a child. You show up late. You have an attitude. It is not helping your partner, and it is not helping you. And I thought we moved on from this behavior. I've tried with Kat, okay? She doesn't trust me. - I don't see that changing. - Put your clothes on. We are not skating today. Okay, so what exactly is this? A Soviet trust exercise or something? Ropes course? Trust falls? Can't imagine it's worth driving us all the way out to... ...wherever we are. Katarina, you are too scared. And you are not scared enough. Go deal with your issues. We'll skate tomorrow. - What does that even mean? - Get out! Is she serious? She's always serious. Okay. Well, we can do this. I'm pretty good with directions. We just need to get our bearings, and... I'm sorry. What is funny about this? I guess Dasha's never heard of Lyft. Wait. Why are we stopping here? The diner I went to as a kid. It had the best meatloaf, besides my mom's. If we get back too soon, Dasha will know we blew off her trust thing. The irony in turning a trust exercise into a giant lie is truly impressive. You just do what you want when you want, don't you? Yup. Should I post this one? Yeah. Sure, I guess. So, like... how do you know if somebody likes you? Someone's hot for teacher. Mitch? No. That's not what I meant. Did he say something or do anything, you know, weird, like, something you should tell an adult about? You're as bad as Kat. Never mind. That poor girl. Rumor is Mitch was involved with his last student, and that's why she freaked out and quit. I guess Serena's the next one in line. You know, it's considered impolite to eavesdrop, so maybe you could just mind your own fucking business. Thanks. - You sure you don't want some? - I'll take your word for it. I can't believe we're doing this instead of practicing. What, you'd rather be at the rink with me not lifting you? Fuck you! But honestly, Kat, what are you so afraid of? I've seen some of your old competition tapes. You were fearless. You've been watching tapes of me? It's my porn. Don't look so uptight. It's not like we haven't slept together or anything. I'm shocked you even remember. I figure I'm a pretty low notch on a very long bedpost. - Are you calling me a man whore? - I didn't call you a man. Touché, Baker. You know, you're really missing out on this meatloaf. - Hmm. - See? Maybe you should trust me after all. If I do, does that mean you'll show up to practice on time? Deal. What about you? You gonna let me lift you? Preferably without slicing my leg open. Fine. No promises on the leg. So we made it back. What are we going to tell Dasha? The truth. We found a trail, built a fire, foraged for berries. We foraged for berries? That's how you find berries, Kat. You forage for them. Then I heroically fought off a bear that tried to eat you. No.I fought the bear. You were searching for berries. Marcus! Hey. Hey. What's up? Oh, you're the dude from my dad's bar, right? Mean mojito, this guy. Thanks. It's what I'm famous for. Oh, what Gabe mentioned earlier. I'm having a thing tonight if you want to swing by. Any time after ten. I can send you the details. I don't usually stay out that late. Oh, come on. Dasha wanted us to bond. Consider this more bonding. It'll be fun. Okay. Sure. Why not? Yeah? All right. Invite whoever. I'll see you tonight. - What are you doing hanging out with him? - Skating... mostly. - Come on. I've got to pick up my paycheck. - Wait. Hold up. Justin Davis is your partner? That dude's a dick. Yes, but he's also a really good skater, and I want to win. Plus, it feels like we're, you know, finding a middle ground. Psh! From what I can tell, he's got zero middle ground with girls. Looks like he got a thing for you, though. No. No! Absolutely not. Okay. Sure. I'm off at 10:30, so I'll meet you there at 11:00. There's absolutely no way I'm leaving you alone with Justin Davis and his knucklehead friends. Knucklehead? - You're so cool. - See you tonight. Oh, are you going out? Yeah. Justin's having a thing. What did I tell you? - Trust exercise works every time. - Yeah. - Worked like a charm. - Good. Well, have fun tonight. Not too much fun. Just the right amount. Hey, is Kat home? - Yes, she's in her room. - Thanks. Hey. Why are you dressed like you're gonna rob a 7-Eleven? Why are you dressed like you're going to someone's funeral? Ouch. I was thinking about wearing it to Justin's party. Justin's having a party? Doesn't matter. You're not going. We have to break into Mitch's place. Why the hell would we do that? Because you actually might be right about him. Thanks. Carol. This is a surprise. I thought that I was the only one who spends their evenings in here alone. I was actually hoping to talk to you about something. Hey, man. Thanks. Of course, man. Look, I just want you to know that everything I do, I do for Serena. And you have been so generous with her, with us, and I just... I want to make sure that my actions don't screw it up. So, if I crossed a line yesterday, I am sorry. Apology accepted. Okay. And... I probably owe you one, too. I... I shouldn't have spoken to you like that. It's just, um... I'm sensitive when it comes to eating issues with my students. My last skater had a really rough go. It was quite tragic. Okay, so, um... Anyway, you probably don't want to talk about that. No. Please, I'm interested. Okay. - Cheers. - Mm! Okay, put it over there with the rest. Hey, man. You didn't see Kat at the rink today, did you? No. Is she supposed to be here? Yeah, she said she would. I have a really good idea. Why don't we do a shot? - Do you want a shot? - No, man. I gotta take it easy. I skate tomorrow. What? Who are you? Are you you anymore? I'll tell you if I see her, though, okay? And first place honors go to Kelly Berman and Justin Davis. Justin! Hey, you finally made it. Oh. Sorry. Don't be. Well, fuck it. Yo! Mr. Mojito! What's up, man? Funny. You're funny. Damn, bro. This place is nice. No wonder my lift pass is so expensive. Hey, is Kat here yet? No, man. Looks like she's not coming. What the fuck's that about? I tried to be a nice guy, but nope. Doesn't matter. She just doesn't... Whatever. We know how to have a good time, right? Bar's over there. Beer, liquor, whatever you want. Why does he live in a trailer? I don't know. He just moved here from Boise. I can't believe I let you talk me into this. Oh, calm down! All we need to do is find proof that Mitch is a disgusting pervert - to your little sister. - How do you even know where he lives? I may have stolen his address from his billing statement the last time he bought stuff at my dad's store. I literally do it all the time. This is insane. This is dumb. What if Leah's full of shit, and we're breaking into his camper for no reason? We should go! After you. Jesus. This place is sad. No wonder he eats at Jimmy's every night. Ssh! Put it on silent! Literally the third rule of breaking and entering. Gloves, crowbar, turn off your phone. Sorry. Sorry. Kat! Over here. I found something. Divorce papers? I didn't even know he was married. To a Rachel Hughes. Isn't she that coach from Boise? He cheated on her. Yeah, with that student, obviously. Jenn, this means I was right. I need to tell my mom. - Shit! - Ouch! Okay. Got it. Come on! Go! - I forgot how these went. - Go! So, you work with Kat. Does she ever just, like, not show up? It's work. She always shows up. Dude, you look as bored with this party as I am. Hey, everybody! Let's go play a game. Let's go play a real game. Anybody want to tell me what the hell this game we're playing is? What the hell? Mr. Mojito's out. Hey, get out of the fucking road! What the fuck are you doing? He can't stop in time! Justin! Oh, man! Pretty sweet, right? Super sweet, bro. Look, I don't know what's up with you, or why you have a death wish, but if you ever drop Kat, hurt her, or do any of that stupid shit you just did, you're gonna wish you didn't just survive that. What makes you think I want to survive? Oh, there you go. There he is! Oh, look. It's Tweedledee. Where is... There she is. We need to talk about Serena. Where is she? She's gone to bed. I'm late for work. There's a rumor going around that Mitch was sleeping with his last student. Oh, a rumor. Well, we should call the cops. I don't have time for this. His wife divorced him for adultery right after the girl had a mental breakdown and quit skating. That can't be a coincidence. Look, I have proof. It's his divorce papers. Where did you find those? I found them. Where? Where? In his camper. What is wrong with you? Are you trying to ruin your sister's life? Mitch is exactly what Serena needs right now, and he's only coaching her on a trial basis, and I'm doing everything to keep him around. Did you not hear anything I just said? People cheat, Kat. People get divorced. It does not make them child molesters. And just so you know, that skater quit because she was anorexic. Mitch checked her into rehab. But no good deed goes unpunished, right? - I didn't know. - You know what I think? I think that you've bit off more than you can chew with Justin. I heard about your little fuck-up yesterday. You're struggling, so you need to bring everyone else down too. I'm just trying to look out for my little sister. Well, don't. She doesn't need your help. Neither of us do. ♪ I can close my eyes and return ♪ ♪ To the home ♪ ♪ I remember in a blur ♪ ♪ Sights and smells ♪ ♪ And sounds of old ♪ ♪ But it's not ♪ ♪ Would have something of my own ♪ Serena! What are you doing here? Hey, is everything okay? Look, it's freezing. Why don't you come inside and we can talk? Come on. - What's up? - Is it true? A trial period? Am I just like some hobby for you or something? It isn't like that. Your mom and I have worked out an arrangement for a training trial period until we can decide what's best for you. Serena! Serena, come back! Thanks for the ride. I'm sorry Mitch isn't a pedophile. Oh, shit. - I missed Justin's party. - Yeah. Which I wasn't invited to, by the way. Rude. But whatever. So... are you guys, like, friends now? No. No, not friends. You know, the pair skating thing's weird, but... I think we're starting to understand each other. At least I... I feel a lot better about it. Better like you might actually let him lift you? Maybe an inch. Thank you for everything. - You okay? - Yeah. Uh, no biggie. See you tomorrow? Yeah. Hi, Jim. It's Carol. Yeah, I know I'm late for my shift. That's why I'm calling. Um... I can't come in tonight. Actually... I quit. Shit. Beautiful! Watch your lines. A little bit higher. Where's Justin? He promised he'd be here. Where are you going? - S'up? - "S'up?" You tracked me down. Some K-pop star took my suite, so I had to move. - You're not room service. - What the fuck, Justin? I thought things were fine between us. I thought we understood each other. Yeah, me too. Then what the hell's going on? You promised you'd be there. Yeah, and you said you'd show up last night, so I guess we're both full of shit. I'm sorry. This is because I missed your party? You know, this whole time I've been thinking that everything's wrong because of me. The lift, your behavior, which sucks by the way! I know I have a lot to learn, but I literally can't do this all by my fucking self! I don't know what your problem is, but I don't give a shit anymore. You want to skate? You know where I'll be. What's wrong? There was an accident. Your mom... I am so sorry. I am so sorry. Oh, God. It is harder when you care. And you haven't cared for a very long time. I don't know what you mean. I'm sorry. Good. You know I'd never let you fall, right? Okay. Fresh start, guys. Come on. Let us try another lift. One more chance. This time with choreography. Come on, guys. Be together. Yes, good! Pick up the speed. Excellent! Together!
