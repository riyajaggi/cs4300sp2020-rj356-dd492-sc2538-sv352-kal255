Double-single-double? Good. That's how it's done. Good morning. - Hey. - Thanks. Yeah. She's doing well. Well, show me. You ready to pick out fabrics? I was thinking something fun and bright for your costume this year. Can we just... Yeah, sure. Let's... Just keep going. - Carol, I... - Before you say anything, I just want to say that, um, I know... we crossed a line, and I'm sorry. You know, it was completely out of character for me. Uh... Maybe not completely, but because of the drinks... Hey! Whoa! I was just gonna say how much I like your hair. Very David Bowie. - Thanks. - I had a good time. I promise. I thought we could go for drinks again. Only that this time, remember to eat so that we don't embarrass ourselves again. Okay. Yeah. Ooh, you're bleeding. Oh, uh, no. It's... It's just, um, a hangnail. I'll just... They passed their senior test, but Regionals is a whole new level. I really want their spins to have an impact on the judges, so anything you can do with the costumes to help. All right. Come on out, kids. Oh, my God! You look like angels. Wow. We look like we're getting ready for the Hunger Games tribute parade. Wait. No! They're perfect. Dad, help me out? Listen to the ladies, son. They always know best. All right. Let's remove the sparkle from his, tighten up the sleeves, maybe move the neckline up a little bit. And as for Kat's, don't change a thing. Oh, my goodness. I didn't realize it was so late. Honey, did you remember to bring the welcome flyers for the conference? Crap, I forgot 'em. I'd go get 'em myself, but I have a meeting in 20 minutes. It's fine. Justin, could you run home and grab 'em real quick? Don't you guys have people for that? Yeah, you. Shit. Listen, I gotta take this call. I'm leaving. - I'll see you later. - Okay. Hello? You look perfect. Mom? Are you okay? Yeah. It's fine. She usually makes my costumes, so it's probably just a little weird for her. Anyway, what's my share? Oh, don't be silly. James and I are taking care of it. Thanks, but when I said I wanted to pay my half, I meant for everything. My mom didn't think I could do this. - I need to show her I can. - Okay, then. Your half will be 700. - Dollars? - Hm-mm. Sure. That's fine. I'll have it for you tomorrow. Okay. Hi, could you help me? Hey, could you help? Oh! Okay, cool. Ugh, two minutes! I can't remember the last time someone hit that. That's Olympic pace! No way, man! I'd have to shave at least ten seconds off to sniff the podium. Whatever! You're giving me a run for my money. Starting to wish I didn't ask you to join the team anymore. Yeah. Look, I'll catch you guys later. I gotta head back to Jimmy's. You know I'm a working man, unlike you. Hey, dude. I hope you know I'm just busting your balls. You're kicking ass. Oh, yeah, man. It's all good. Oh! Oh! Let me help you with this. - There you go. - Thank you. Of course. All these people, and it's like I'm invisible. - I'm Alana. - Marcus. Uh... So, how long have you been working here? Just started. Uh, just needed some extra help to get me out of CDI. It's a small community college not too far from here. Oh, cool. Yeah. I can't lie, I almost broke my neck when I saw a black guy on the ski team. Yeah, it's white as snow here. Yeah. But it's cool, you know. You get used to it. Just make sure you have your camera ready when these guys get drunk later and try and dance at the conference, like conga line and shit. - You'll never forget it. - Okay. You actually won't be able to forget it. Okay! I'll see you around. All right. You too. Nope. No way! That one. Perfect for Leah. It's like a peacock ate another peacock and then puked it up. It just might be busy enough to distract from how much of a bitch she is. Come on. She's not that bad. Plus, I think we finally have a shot at beating Justin, so I'm trying to be a fan of hers. Speak of the devil! I got over my liking-my-straight-friends phase a long time ago, but I will never deny how hot he is! He's okay. Stop it. Nobody would ever describe Justin Davis as "okay." You'd totally bone him. I have the best idea! We're going out tonight. Go invite him. - No way. - Go. - No. - Fly, little bird. - No! - Then I'm doing it. I hate you so much right now. Justin? Uh, me and Gabe are getting shitty tonight at Grayson's Alehouse if you wanna come. Cool. I'll try. Bye! Oh, my God! He's so into you. No! Okay. Here we go. Let's move. Well, thanks. I will be sure to reach out if I ever think of buying a house there. And I will be your roommate. Uh, company card. Enjoy. Holy shit! He gave me a $120 tip. That, with the money I have saved up, means I can pay my half for the skating costume. I can pay the choreographer. I can pay the coach, my ice time. My mom's just gonna have to live another day knowing her daughter's actually doing this skating thing on her own, thank you very much. Cool. Hey, look, what's up with these one-word answers? Am I missing something? You texted me that you were with your sister. I was. And then I saw you skating with Justin. What do you think... I just don't wanna chase after a lost cause. There's nothing going on with Justin. I was with my sister when I texted you. Look, what you saw was just a last-minute practice. I promise. Hey... give me another chance, okay? We can go out tonight? We'll talk about anything but Justin. Well, I mean, there is this arts walk thing I was gonna go to. Really? Me too. Call it a date? I work the split-shift. I could meet you after. I gotta go to the bank and get changed, so I'll meet you in the lobby when you're done? Cool. Cool. Hey! Knock it off! Idiots! Hey, have you guys seen a big, blue box anywhere? I guess Dad left it here. Ask him yourself, idiot. He can't, idiot. Dad's at the doctor with Mandy getting the ultrasound. Mandy's pregnant? You weren't supposed to say that. Sorry. Dad was gonna tell you at the family dinner tomorrow. Why should I give a shit? Nothing to do with me. Thank you, Margie. Appreciate it. - Next. - Hey. I'd like to deposit this cash and get a money order for $700, please. I'm sorry, you don't have enough money in your account for the money order. No, I... I have $1,586.19. I keep track of everything. Can you just check it again? I understand that, Miss, but you have no money in your account. That's not possible. Wait. It says here that the co-owner of the account made a withdrawal earlier today, a Carol Baker. Anything you want. Anything. Well, up to $1,586, but that's enough, right? Wait. Seriously? - Mom, where'd you get that much money? - Well, I have savings, sweetheart. Plus, no expense is too much for my favorite daughter. Oh, come on! That deserves a smile, at least. What's up with you lately? Mitch is my coach, Mom. I know that. What's that have to do with anything? Harley's cousin saw you guys wasted, hanging all over each other at some random bar the other night. I want you to stop seeing him. My dating life is none of your business! I deserve to be happy! So why don't you just check your attitude and let me buy you a fucking dress? This is nice. I can't believe you actually stole from me. - You took everything out of my account. - Your bank account? It's our bank account, okay? And let's not even talk about who owes who here. I paid for you for 18 years. Frankly, this is a drop in the bucket. Bullshit! That was my money. I've worked for months to save that up. Oh, God! Always so dramatic. I closed the account. Just stay out of my life. Pretty. Is it true? Of course not, okay? Kat's just mad that she's not gonna be the only one getting a new competition dress. You're on my side, right, honey? I know how hard it is for you to handle Kat sometimes, especially since you're bipolar. Oh, hi, Mitch. Why did you do that? Can you let Mandy know I brought this by? Of course, Mr. Davis. She's actually right here. Oh, great. You found them. Thank you so much, Justin. Alana, could you go ahead and get those flyers out for me, please? Honey, don't forget you're on your own for dinner tonight. Hey, you heard the lady. What do you say we go into town and get us some steaks? You couldn't just tell me earlier, face-to-face? What are you talking about? I had to find out from my little brothers that you and Mandy are having a kid. Justin, I... It's fine that you don't give a shit about what I think. The thing that really sucks is that... I'm the only one that still seems to remember Mom. This has nothing to do with your mother. Yeah. Gotta go. - There you go. - Thanks. Ah, you again. You're not getting tired of me? Never! Good. Hey, look, I don't mean to be rude, but I have to ask... Are you driving home tonight? Oh, you are so sweet to care. No, I'm... I'm visiting my son. In fact, I'm staying at the hotel. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Here you go. Where's the rest? That is the rest, ma'am. You gave me a twenty. I gave you a hundred-dollar bill, and you know it. I don't even carry bills as small as a twenty! You're a goddamn thief! Ma'am, I promise you that's your exact change. You saw me ring it up. - Please calm down... - Don't touch me! I'm calling the police. Is there a problem? Who are you? The manager. I heard some commotion and came over to help. This bartender here stole money from me. - I didn't... - I'm so sorry to hear that, ma'am. We absolutely can call the police, and I will go ask Kevin to pull the security footage right now. Wait, sorry. Security footage? Yes, ma'am. We have hidden cameras behind the bar. Oh, my gosh. I am so stupid. It was a twenty! I... I had change from a thing earlier. I think it's best that you leave that at the bar, ma'am. Looks like you've had a too much to drink. Can you believe that shit? I swear, they try to use the police as their own personal bodyguard. Security cameras? Yeah, that's bullshit. Look, if you're trying to get a break from these folks, there's this thing with my friends tonight. You're welcome to come. I appreciate it, but I'm meeting up with a friend tonight. Some other time. Yeah. Yeah. No! Coming! - Hey. - Hey. Outfit for your date tonight, as requested. Thanks. Take it off before you guys, you know... Gross. One second. I'm just in the middle of something. What the hell are you doing? Please don't tell me you're making your own skin suit. No! It's the costume for my long program. Uh-uh. This is literally the most terrifying thing - I've ever seen. - Look, I don't have a choice, okay? My mom drained my bank account. Now I'm down 700 fucking dollars that I owe Mandy for the costume she's having made for me, and if I can't pay her, I'm just gonna have to make my own. Fuck! Can you go get my seam ripper from my top dresser drawer? - Yeah. - Thank you. Even if I manage to make this not look terrible, I'm still completely screwed on my whole payment plan. At this point, I can't even pay for my ice time anymore. You have Study Buddies? You've been holding out. Just used to take them for a while to help me focus, but they made me crazy, so... All these years, I thought you were a better skater, but you've just been using performance-enhancing drugs. What else don't I know? If you need money, you could get like twenty dollars a pill. It's a very lucrative market. Jenn, look, I'm drowning here, okay? This is serious. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I know it is, okay? And I literally have no idea how you're managing everything. Okay. Here. It's not all of it, but it'll help. I can't take that. Take it. You're like the stressed-out, high-strung sister I never had. It's like, what, half the costume, right? I'm sure Mandy will be fine with that until you get the rest. Thank you. You're the one doing me a favor. That's like 300 less that I'll blow at Grayson's Alehouse tonight. Me, Gabe, and Justin are going there for College Night. Not gonna lie, kind of excited! Now, stop this sad little arts and craft bullshit! Go and have fun with Marcus. You can't let money, stress, and definitely not Carol ruin your life. Go! ♪ Please don't take it so badly ♪ ♪ 'Cause you know... ♪ You're my best girl. Get out! - What? - I said get out of the car. Mitch needed to know what he was getting into. If you kept dating him and he saw how crazy you were, you'd just end up driving him away. I said get out of this car before I do something I regret! Argh! I can't believe you! Little fucker! - Hello? - Kat, can you come pick me up at the rink? Mom's all mad because I didn't want her dating Mitch, and now I'm stuck with no way to get home. Wait. What? She's dating Mitch? Kat! Please just come. I can't. I'm meeting Marcus. I'm gonna be late. My phone's about to die. Come on. You'll be, like, five minutes late. I need your help. Just be outside, okay? ♪ Honey, let your fire... ♪ You've gotta be fucking kidding me! No, no, no, no, no! Fuck! Fuck! - Yeah? - Hey... Hey, girl. You look tired. - ...stupid shit car broke down... - Shut up, Reid. ...out of nowhere. You look awesome. You wanna come drive around? Yeah. It's fine. Justin's brothers are gonna give me a ride. So where are we going? Hello? Hi. My car is broken down on Route 75. I don't know what's wrong. Can you just tow me to the nearest repair shop, please? And then give me a ride to Pinecrest Lodge? I'm supposed to meet someone there, like, now. Two hours? Fuck! No! No, okay, that's fine. I'll be waiting. No, no, no, no! Fuck! No-show, huh? Hm. Any chance this friend you're waiting for is a girlfriend? To be honest, I don't know what me and Kat are. Kat? Little ice skater chick at Jimmy's? Oh, come on. There's nothing wrong with dating a white girl. I didn't even say nothing. Yeah, but I know what you're thinking. Trust me. I've heard it before. It's not some big deal. It's just... all I know. They were the only girls I was around growing up. You do look like the Jack and Jill type. So you mean to tell me you didn't meet any other black girls there? I did, but it was always awkward 'cause at every event, my mom would damn near make me talk to them, so it never worked out. Hm-mm. So... I'm about to go meet my friends. I think I'm gonna just head home. You have fun, though. All right. You too. Hey, wait. I'm coming. ♪ I want you to know ♪ ♪ I've started to show ♪ ♪ It ain't easy ♪ ♪ Takin' it slow ♪ ♪ So I don't know why it's gotta be... ♪ Justin! I've had a shit day, and I need as many drinks as it takes to forget. I've been doing that for three months. Let's go. ♪ We've got to let it go ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ - ♪ And I've got something ♪ - Whiskey? Two whiskeys. ♪ On my mind ♪ ♪ We ♪ ♪ Have got to let it go ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ You ♪ ♪ I've got somethin' ♪ Hey. Have you seen Marcus? He left, like, I don't know, 45 minutes ago. - Maybe an hour. - Shit! Okay. Can I use your phone? Nice jacket. Your new mommy buy it for you? That's a thousand-dollar bottle of champagne. You used my savings to buy that. Limited edition. You promised. You promised you'd stay on your meds. Look at you! - You're a mess. - Always with the fucking meds! I'm fine! I don't have time for this. Don't ignore me! I am still your mother! Stop! Oh, what? What's wrong, Kat? Am I embarrassing you? Do I embarrass you? You're gonna wish you were nicer to me. Calm down, okay? Just... Just calm down. No! I will calm down whenever I'm goddamn ready to calm down! You'll see! You'll see you need to respect your mother! Me, not that other bitch! You wanna know what I think of Mandy and her perfect fucking hair? Stop! And her perfect fucking real estate company? - It's fucking trash! It's all trash! - You're right. Okay. I'm ungrateful. All right? I'm sorry. You can keep the money. Let's get outta here. No, now you're just saying what you think I wanna hear. You think I can't tell the difference between a lie and the truth! But I can! I do! I see everything! I know everything! Mom, you're having an episode. We need to leave, okay? Don't you dare judge me. 'Cause you'll never know what it's like to get dirty, clawing your way out of the shit. How could you? You don't have the tools to succeed. You're just a fucking loser who couldn't get over a little fall! You're not yourself right now. At least I'm not you. You'll never be a champion. Never. All that glitters isn't gold, Kat, and you're just a little glitter. Kat. Carol. Is everything all right? Stay out of it. It's none of your business. It's okay. It's okay. Um, I need... I need to go, okay? Go. I don't know how you gave birth to a girl as wonderful as your daughter, and I don't know what you're on right now, but if you're gonna mess with Kat, you'll be messing with me too. And you do not want to fuck with me! Could we call a cab for Ms. Baker, please? - Yes, absolutely. - Thank you. ♪ T-t-t-take it back ♪ ♪ I should know better ♪ ♪ T-t-t-take it back... ♪ Whoo! Yes! Shake it, Gabe! Shake that ass! Okay, last shot. Last shot. Here we go. No chaser all night. You're a champ! Yeah, everywhere except the ice. Ssh. Don't tell my parents. At least you have parents that actually care about you. Uh, be careful what you wish for. It's so much fucking pressure. I don't know how the hell I'm gonna keep on skating, but I have to... for them. It's really brave. It's also stupid. Well, maybe I like to do brave, stupid shit. - Do you have a condom? - Yeah. Glove compartment. - Ow! My hip. - Sorry. Let me just... One second. Fuck! What are you doing? Really? Ew! Never mind. It'll still work. Okay. Whoa! What the hell is she doing here? She's supposed to be on a date. Ugh! Something's wrong. I'm gonna go. Oh... Can we not mention this mess to anyone? I never kiss and tell. And nothing to tell. We're good. You're calling a Lyft, right? You definitely can't drive. I'll probably sleep it off back here. Okay. Kat! Kat! There you are. Where's Justin and Gabe? Justin isn't here, but Gabe definitely is. - Where's Marcus? - It's a long story. I'll tell you about it later, but right now I need your help, okay? And I need you to keep it between you and me. My car broke down, and the tow truck cost $300. And it's gonna be $600 on top of that to get it fixed. I am sick and tired of trying to do everything right, and I will not let my mother think I failed. Fuck half the money! I wanna make all of it. I'm ready to get dirty. I'm ready to crawl and scrape my way out of this shit. Okay. Calm down there, buddy. This is not Goodfellas. Lucky for you, not only is this College Night, but it's midterms. Surge pricing. Okay. Looks like Trent Trowley will be purchasing the Pabst Blue Ribbon tonight. It's never gonna work. - ♪ If I leave ♪ - Oh, I love this song. ♪ Here tomorrow ♪ The hell? Sorry. It's just... You know when something happens and it's the worst, then every time you hear something, it reminds you how fucked-up things are? I just hate that song, okay? Me too. I'm deleting it from my ears. Got your Cheetos. Where's the beer, "Trent?" ID got taken away. - It's not that funny. - It is. Hey! How about we see what Jones and Mac are up to? - All right, yeah. - Yeah. Unless you've got a curfew? Nope. I'm good. All righty then. - We're good! - Let's roll. All right! Carol? Carol? Um... You know your front door is wide open? I've been trying to call you. - Carol? - You don't understand. If the house isn't clean, my girls won't come home. They'll need a clean house, or they'll get sick. And if they get sick, I'll never be able to forgive myself. Hey, hey, hey. Sh-sh. Mandy's a better mom than me. And now Serena hates me too. And I need to clean the fucking floor. I'll help you clean. Can I do that? Just... tell me where it's dirty. Okay. What Serena said... I'm bipolar. But when I take my meds, I'm all flat. And I don't wanna be a bad mom. Mandy's a better mom than me. And now Serena hates me too. But I have to wait up for Serena. What if I keep cleaning and... you get some sleep? I can't. Not till Serena gets home. I'll wait up for Serena. You should rest. Okay. Ugh! What is your car doing on my golf course? What's... Well... that's the 12th tee, right? So I was probably scared of hooking it. This some kinda joke to you? No! Twelfth's a killer. Three hundred yards, damn sand trap. Okay, yeah, I'll pay for the damage to the greens, okay? You think I give a shit about the goddamn greens? You got drunk, and you got behind the wheel of a car! I was a block away from the bar, Dad. I was taking a shortcut. You got drunk, and you got behind the wheel of a car. Fuck. You're right, Dad. That was... That was stupid. I wasn't thinking about... I can't do this again, Justin. I can't. I can't lose you this way, too. Dad, you won't. Okay? This won't happen again. I promise. I'm sorry you found out the way you did. It's okay. And I will always love your mother. I miss her like hell. Yeah. I blame myself for this. Your behavior. I've coddled you. I've given you too much, trying to fill a void your mother left. But I can't do this anymore, Justin. This is your final warning. One more fuck-up, one more, - and I'm finished. - Dad... Where's my mom? Daddy! Daddy, no! Daddy, wait! Leave, you piece of shit! Get out of here! We don't need you! And your daughter's not even gonna remember your name! ♪ I can't change ♪ ♪ Won't you fly high ♪ ♪ Free bird, yeah... ♪ So... when are you leaving? - Serena, I... - You know she's sick. When are you leaving? I'm not going anywhere. Here... I think this is the one you liked. This is Carol Baker... calling for Dr. Kessler. I want to check myself in. I need help. Hey. Yo, Marcus! You've gotta meet my mom. Marcus and I met yesterday, didn't we? Brent told me you're the fastest guy on the team now. Knocked my son right out of the top spot. Not an easy task. She's gotta catch a five o'clock flight, but glad you guys could meet. Catch you later, dude. Kat Baker. - Nice you could join us. - Thanks for having me. Thank you for coming. Here's the money for the costumes. Seven hundred dollars. It's all there. Oh, thank you, sweetie, but you know you really didn't have to do that. I know why she did it. I'm the same way. Never liked a handout. And thank you, by the way, for being such a good example with Justin. He certainly needs all the help he can get right now. Seven hundred? Those costumes are five grand! I know what it's like to be a proud girl with no money. Marcus? I'm... I'm so sorry. Yeah, me too. Mr. Davis? Excellent. What was that all about? Nothing. What happened to you? Car trouble. Yeah. Me too. ♪ Gotta see it!
