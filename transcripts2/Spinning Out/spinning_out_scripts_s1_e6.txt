 ♪ Put it on my tab ♪ ♪ Whatever the cost ♪ ♪ I'm good for it ♪ Yeah! Whoo! Way to go, Jenn! Jenny? Jenny. Uh... Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for your... Um... ...continued support. That was so weird. Shut up. And thank you on behalf of my mother who has come all the way from St. Louis to watch Jenny skate her short program at the ice show this weekend. With the support of our fellow church members, friends, family, and the Lord, it would be fortuitous to see our Jenny go all the way to the Beijing Olympics in 2022! ♪ Don't you wanna ♪ ♪ Be adored ♪ ♪ Be adored ♪ ♪ Give me a crown ♪ ♪ I'll pass it round and show it off ♪ ♪ When I'm insane ♪ ♪ From all your games ♪ ♪ I'll ask my friends to find out how to let you go ♪ ♪ See, hang around ♪ ♪ Let me down ♪ Hey. Mom's on her way back. It was nice having you home these last of couple weeks. Do you think maybe you could stay? You know I can't. I'll just put this in your room. Hi, Mom. Hey, baby. It's good to be home. How was the, uh... Mental hospital. It's okay. You can say it. It was good. The hardest part was probably finding the right trial meds. - Mom... - Don't worry, honey. I had awesome counselors who took great care of me. I'm good. Clear-headed. Kat... it's nice that you're here. Yeah. I wasn't about to let one of your boyfriends look after Serena. I deserve that, not you. Would you... drive Serena to the rink? I wanna talk to Kat. - Sure. - Thank you. Serena, you ready? I know you're not going to believe this, and you have every right not to, but... - things'll be different... - ...this time. It's already different. I have a plan. I found a really good therapist that I'm going to see twice a week. With what money? I had to find out from Serena that you quit your job weeks ago. I'll look for a new job. And how long's that gonna take? The facility you were just at, how are you gonna pay for that? You don't have insurance. I don't know. I'll get a loan or something. Come on! Can't this be a fresh start? Your life is a series of fresh starts. After a while, they just... They don't mean anything. Davis! Help a lady out? I can't tie my skates with this busted knee. Didn't you hurt your hip? I've been trying to lay off it so much that I messed up my right knee. Why the hell are you still skating? Like, my entire church is coming to see me in this stupid ice show. It might be the last time my grandma sees me skate. And honestly, if I take any time off, there's no way I'm even getting close to qualifying for 2022. Sounds like you need a drink. Yeah. I mean, the last time we got a drink, things got a little... - Oh, yeah. Thought we weren't gonna... - Talk about it? We're not. So... you buying? Gonna see what Gabe and Kat are doing, and we'll all meet up. Cool. The more, the merrier. No. No. No way. Not today. We don't even need triples for the ice show. I'm just... I'm not ready. Katarina, you do everything else perfect. Your problem is a mental block. Yeah, because last time I did a triple jump, I cracked my skull open. Let me ask you a question. If you jump in a harness, do you think you will crack your skull? Is it possible? Is it not possible? Not possible. Correct. You're a good student. What did I promise before we started training? You'd fix me. Right again. A-plus. Come on, the belt. Come on! This morning, what Kat said... You are not just another guy to my mom. I can tell. Thank you. Hey, Serena! Need a ride? We're gonna get tacos. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to. My mom's at a thing... Wait. Oh, I don't think that's up to me. Except you're my coach. And you and my mom are, you know, so... Come on! They're super responsible. Please? Just be home for dinner. I told your mom that I'd come around to cook, - so... - I'm coming! - Get in the back seat. - And don't be late! - Hi, guys! - Hey! And no hockey! Argh! Again! And this time, you will land the triple toe loop. Who pops ten times on the harness? - Shut up. - Yeah, Justin. Shut your mouth. Katarina, we're not leaving until you at least try once. Come on, Kat. You're so close, Kat! Oh, my God. No, I can't do this. I can't do this! I can't do this! You can! You can! You can! You just went for it! It's a big step for you. Now, we're gonna do it again, and you're gonna try to count to six before you jump. What does that mean? One, two, three, four, five, six. Reach, pick, rotation, rotation, rotation, land. You won't rush the entrance this way. Come on, Kat. Okay. Yes! Whoo! He didn't pull! He didn't pull! I know he didn't pull. - It was you! It was you! - Yes! Oh, my God. I did it! Okay! And we stop now. - What? No! We have to go again! - No more jumps for today. - Let's practice tango for the ice show. - Come on. You've gotta let her go again. No. You heard my words. Ending on a good note is the best medicine for a tricky head like yours. You trust me, right? You did it. I can't believe it. I almost feel like celebrating. Good, 'cause I almost feel like celebrating with you. Sorry to keep you waiting, Ms. Baker. Oh, no worries. I... I was just enjoying your... your... your plaque... thing. A birthday gift from my family. We like to stay positive. So... I see you're requesting a three-year $10,000 loan. Yeah, I know I don't look great on paper, but I promise I'm good for it. I'm sure you are, but with your debts, low credit score, lack of consistent employment, unfortunately, the bank isn't able to grant your request. Can I be honest with you? Ken, um... I need... this loan. You see, I... I've been sick. I'm doing better now. I own my home and my car... and I have money in this bank. If I can't get this money, then I... I can't keep getting the treatment I need to stay healthy. Please... Ken. I'm sorry. The bank just doesn't consider you a good risk. Who the fuck are you to boil my life down to a risk? I know you're just doing your job. Thank you for taking the time to hear me out. Have a nice day. I-25. I-25. Is this I-25? What? It's too dark in here. Eyes on your own cards, Dora! Hey, so now that Kat's finally jumping again, do you think maybe we can sign up for any of the practice competitions before Regionals? N-33. N-33. This year? No, absolutely not. Too much, too soon. She'll freak out, as we say. And then everything will crumble. Okay, okay. She was pretty amazing out there today. G-53. That's G-5-3. - You like her. - What? No! Tell me the truth. Okay, fine. I like her, but who are you to judge? You married your partner. That is not the same. Yeah. And you keep your pants on. Shouldn't be a problem. She doesn't like me. It's very important to keep things professional. And don't put any ideas in her head about Regionals. It is not your year. B-10. B-10. Dasha, I think you... Bingo! Yup! Eat it, Dora. James, honey, I'm feeling great. I love you. Okay, I gotta go. I'm meetin' a client soon. Bye. I need you to sell my house. Carol? Uh... your secretary said I could find you here. - Well, now's not a good time. - This will just take a minute. Um... I'm in some deep shit. And the only way I can get out of it is to sell my house. Now, I know we got off on the wrong foot... - Isn't that a nice way to put it? - I was out of hand. But you need to know I am not a bad mother. I don't do drugs. And if your bench ads all over town are true and you really are the best Realtor in Sun Valley, I need you to sell my house. See, real estate works best when a Realtor and client share a mutual respect. You don't have to respect me! - There are a hundred other Realtors. - But none that I can trust. Look... You took care of Kat when I... couldn't. That means something. Please? I didn't play hockey, I swear. I... might've played some broomball. Damn it, Serena! Please don't tell Mom. Do you understand the position you put me in? I let you go. And you took advantage of my trust. I know. I'm sorry. Bring it here. Does it hurt when I do that? How about that? Oh, okay. Okay. Well, it's not broken, but you probably sprained it again. I won't tell your mom when she gets home. She doesn't need this on top of everything else. But I'll come by in the morning, and I'll take you to Dr. Parker before practice. - Oh, my God. Thank you... - I'm not done. We are only weeks away from Regionals, and yet you did exactly what I told you not to do. If you pull another stunt like this again, you can find yourself another coach. I only landed it once on the harness. Which is a big victory. Okay. I'm not gonna lie, felt pretty great to land that triple toe. Whoa! - What? - Nothing. I just... wasn't ever sure you knew how to smile. Stop trying to distract me. Okay. I see how it is. Okay. Ah! Hey... So... I know it was a pretty big risk... taking me on, and... I realize I've never really said thank you. Believing I could do this. So, thank you. The best decision Dasha ever forced me into. Ha-ha. Can I ask you a personal question? How can someone be so good at skating... and suck so bad at darts? I do not suck. I've been letting you win. - Really? - Yeah. How generous. Loser buys the next round. Oh. Okay. I'll be right back. Can I get two more? - Can I get you a drink? - Can I get a shot of tequila, please? Honey, I'm so sorry I'm late. - It's okay. - Hi! Leah wanted some extra ice time so we could take those bitches down at the ice show. It's supposed to be a day of family entertainment. You can keep thinking that, but you know as well as I do, it's a cut-throat preview to competition season. Speaking of, though, where is lover boy? Oh, he texted to say something came up. What a waste of my good underwear. You know what? Screw Justin and the STD he rode in on. What about the brunette with that very intense gaze? - Kat? - Yeah. I don't know. I can't reach her. Honey, there's a story unfolding here. Justin and Kat? Uh, no way. She wouldn't do that to me. God, where is she? I really need to talk to her. Talk to me. I'll put on a wig. I'll hit you with that very intense stare. You won't know the difference, I swear. Hm... I should go. Ugh! Cheers! The flock will be up at dawn, telling me I'm their last great hope. Wouldn't wanna miss it. You're so cool. I wish I had a fan club. - I love you. - I love you. Now, barkeep, you look like you could give me a nice, strong pour. You sure you don't wanna grab some meatloaf? Still time to cancel your car. You and your meatloaf. You are a meatloaf. No, I have to go home. I've gotta get some sleep before practice tomorrow. Yeah, okay. That was quick. Yeah. So, uh... I guess I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. See you tomorrow.

How do you think of me? Did you get these from me lifting you? Uh... No. Um... I used to bite myself. Do you still do it? No. I actually... haven't needed to... since things have been going well for us. I know. I was telling Dasha that the other day. I feel the exact same way. So, I don't mean to freak you out or anything, but... I've never felt this good about another partner in my life. I just feel like everything's coming together at the exact right moment. I honestly think that we could go all the way to the Olympics. No pressure. You feel like breakfast? I want breakfast. Let's get breakfast. Way to go, Jenn! Jenn? Jenn... Jenn? Oh, hey. What are you doing here? Hiding from the Chinese and my dying grandmother. You know, the ushe. Dude, where were you last night? You didn't answer my texts. Sorry, I... turned my phone off. I really needed to talk to you. Okay. Well, I'm here now. Okay. So... don't, like, freak out, but... I kind of reinjured my hip when we broke into Mitch's trailer. It's serious. - Jenn, why didn't you tell me? - It's fine. Dr. Parker was keeping an eye on it. We thought it would be okay... but it's not. And now my family's looking to me like the baby Jesus. Hm. And it's like everyone's expecting you to just keep smiling through the pain. And you do, but the whole time, it feels like your air supply is shutting off. And mine's on empty, dude. There's no way I can get through my short program with this leg tomorrow. Okay. Well, who says you have to do your short program? What about "Blurred Lines"? What? There are no hard jumps in it, and people loved that program. That song was from six years ago. Robin Thicke isn't even a thing anymore. Does Grandma Yu know that? Here... This... is for good luck. - Now I'll be with you on the ice tomorrow. - You're corny. But thanks. So what are you doing here? Oh, you know, just... smiling through the fear. See you later. I'm sorry I was harsh on you last night. It's difficult to know where to draw the line between being your mom's boyfriend and being your coach. Please don't drop me. I'm not gonna drop you. You're too good. We'll tell your mom that you fell on your triple flip in practice, okay? Yeah, okay. Great. I'll see you in a month. Serena Baker. I'm back. Hey, Ethan. Thanks for fitting us in at such short notice. - I wouldn't trust Serena with anyone else. - Of course. What's the story this time, Miss Baker? I bit it on a triple flip. Oh, boy. Okay. Let's take a look. Thank you for coming. I wasn't sure you would. Neither was I. I might've went a little nuts with the Pine-Sol. Should I crack a window? Oh, it's fine. Can I get you some coffee? Uh, me and caffeine are on a break. Um... I know you're busy, so I put together some specs. Okay. It's a nice family area. Sale prices are up. The house down the street sold in a week. And I have more square-footage and a garage. Where are the bedrooms? Oh, right down here. Bathroom, master, Serena's bedroom, and this was Kat's bedroom. Or is. I haven't moved anything out in case she decides to come back. You know kids. One minute you're their whole universe, and the next, you can go fuck yourself. And I know it's not like the mansions you usually sell, but it's home. I would've killed to grow up in a place like this. What? Isn't life a bitch? The only way I can help my girls is to sell the home I raised them in. What? Mandy? Mandy? Are you okay? Mandy? Well, hey. Hey... Hey, hey, hey. Hey, breathe with me. Breathe, okay? In and out. - Okay. - Slowly breathe. Out. Take a sip. Okay. Okay. Calm down. I'm pregnant. Well, no wonder you're scared shitless. First one's always the scariest. It's not my first. I had a daughter... have a daughter. James doesn't even know. No one does. I was 15. It felt like the right thing to do, to give my baby up. Fifteen. She must be Kat's age by now. Yeah. James and I have had... four miscarriages. I can't... I can't help but wonder... if it's the universe's way of punishing me for giving my kid up. If it's any consolation, keeping my kids hasn't stopped the universe from punishing me. And as long as we're putting things out into the universe, Kat wasn't an accident. I told everyone she was. Myself included. And I blamed her for ending my skating career. It just seemed easier... than to admit that I was never going to make it to the Olympics. Look at us hiding out in the bathroom like we've done something wrong. I'm gonna sell your house. Thanks. Argh! Fuck! ♪ The life I danced in ♪ ♪ And could get... ♪ What are you doing here? George called me. He said you'd been out too long. He was worried. Why? Because I popped my toe like a hundred times? Go on. Go ahead and say it. I'm a failure. I wasn't going to say that. God, I hate seeing you beating yourself up like this. Look, can we... Can we talk? Just for, like, a minute. I didn't think the pressure would be as bad in pairs. Justin's relying on me, and I'm gonna ruin everything. No, you're not. I can't land any of my triple jumps. If it's not the PTSD, then it's the lithium making me foggy and tired all the time. I get it. It's like walking a tightrope. So this is just... how it's gonna be. Forever. Tightrope. It's why I used to go off my meds. 'Cause when I did, I had... this energy, this... confidence. I felt like Wonder Woman. I could... take you girls to practice, work a shift at the airport, do the grocery shopping, all on, like, an hour of sleep. Listen... I don't remember much of what I've said... and done the last couple of weeks, but I do know that... I owe you an apology. Here. It's all there. Don't cash it yet. Give me a couple of days. Don't judge me. It's just until I can get my confidence back. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 18th annual ice show. This year's theme is Here Comes Spring. Carol! Hey, I've been meaning to call you. I can't in good conscience sell your home. Who do I gotta... ask to get help around here? God! Sorry. It's just you were my last hope, so now I don't... I want to offer you a job. Working for me! I mean, it's not glamorous. It's a lot of getting coffee, filing, stapling, answering phones, but... here's how I see it... Okay, with a job and a call to the bank from James, you'll be able to get the loan you need and keep your house. Will the position lead to growth? I'm gonna take that as a yes. Yes. - Enjoy the show. - Thanks. Yes! So remember... tango is supposed to be sexy, not stressful. No one wants to watch stressful tango, especially at this silly ice show. When you have fun, they have fun. Yeah? Hm-mm. Let's do it. - Let's do the triple toe. - What? But Dasha said we're not ready. Look, if we're gonna go all the way, I'm starting now. Let's welcome to the ice Katarina Baker and Justin Davis. Whoo! Holy shit! Kat just landed a triple toe! - Guess the Davis method really works. - What are you talking about? You didn't hear? Alex Kowalski's mom spotted Kat leaving Justin's suite yesterday morning. Another notch on Justin Davis' bedpost. I'm sorry. What are you talking about? Jenn? Jenn? Good job! We're so proud of you! So proud! These are for you. Great job. What a good job you did. Oh, my gosh! Thanks. I'm Kat. I'm Jenn. Whoo! Kat, you were amazing. She did it! I can't tell you how great that felt. Like, it was easy. Okay. Okay. I can see you're very excited, but let us calm ourselves a bit, yes? I'll catch up with you guys in a second. You did it. You fixed her. No. What she did today, she's responsible. - Whoa! - You okay? Yeah, yeah. It just has been a long day. You know what? You just go watch the rest of the show. I'll be okay. Jenn! Hey, wait up. Did you see I did it? Hey, where are you going? You lied to me. - The hell are you talking about? - Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's that our entire lives, you've just taken anything you wanted and I have to pretend I'm okay with it. I've always been second to you, and I made my peace with that, but not with this. - I don't know what... - You slept with Justin, you fucking asshole! Look, I'm... I'm sorry, okay? I... For 12 years, I've considered you my best friend, but I'm realizing I was never yours. No one is because all you care about is you. You know what? Fuck this. I'm done being second to you. Please welcome to the ice Jenn Yu. What happened to "Blurred Lines"? - She's doing her short program. - Why? To show she can. Yes! You were perfect. I'm so sorry. You know I never meant to... I don't know. I guess, besides Kat and Jenn, my favorite was Eddie in the little duck costume. Yeah, that was adorable. It was less adorable when you caught his drunk mother doing the same choreography in the stands. I'm really sorry you couldn't be out there skating tonight, honey. Mitch, you've gotta take it easy on her. She's falling apart at the seams. It's not really his fault. Well, you know I'm just teasing, right? 'Cause we're so lucky to have you looking out for us. I'll get it. - No way! - Hmm! - Hey, Reg. - Hey, Carol. Mitch, this is Reggie. This is Serena's father. Hey, man. Hey. I've redecorated my room since the last time you were here. I have so much to tell you! Dasha! If you're in pajamas, Justin's here. We're here to celebrate! Brought you Chinese food. Dasha! Dasha! Dasha! Dasha, wake up. Call an ambulance. Dasha, wake up. Dasha!
