 ♪ Whatever the cost ♪ ♪ I'm good for it ♪ [machine beeping, indistinct announcement over PA] [louder beeping] What's happening? Is she okay? Is she waking up? It's just time to change her IV bag. Oh. [Carol] She hit her head on the ice, but she'll be okay. Hey. Look who's finally up. How did I get here? [Carol] I told you, honey. You had an episode. Justin found you in his bathtub, shaking. He said you kept asking for me. - It's all kind of fuzzy. - I know it is. But the good news is Justin called me and not the hospital. And I got you right back on your lithium so your secret's safe, and that's really all you can ask for when you have an episode. Oh, and this time I told everyone you have pneumonia, so no one will think twice when you don't show up at Sectionals tomorrow. Tomorrow? How long have I been asleep? Three... four. Four days. I mean, I can't even keep track, and I'm not the one adjusting to the lithium. I need to call Justin. He must be freaking out. Has he come by or... He didn't come see me? It's a lot to take in. Why don't you give him a minute. Well... What does he know? What did you tell him? Well, he knows you have bipolar. But I made him promise not to say anything. I can't believe I was so stupid. Hey! Look, our disorder's hard enough without beating ourselves up about it every time the symptoms come back. Except I had it under control. At least I did until I fell. Mistakes happen. Skaters fall. You know? But right now, all you need to worry about is putting the past in the past and focusing on the long game. [cell phone buzzing] Hi, Mandy. How's that baby doing? Two more ounces? That's great! Yeah, she's okay. Yeah, she's hating she's missing Sectionals tomorrow, but what are you gonna do? Pneumonia's a bitch. [inhales deeply] [sighs] [James] Get up. - How did you get in here? - It's my hotel. We need to talk. About what a disappointment I am? There... We just did. Cut it out! I wanna make sure I got this right. You threw a huge party while your girlfriend had pneumonia. I'm a bad boyfriend. Yeah. Because Mandy doesn't think so. She thinks you're crazy about this girl, that you've been turning a corner lately, finally growing up. But you don't. I promised her I'd give you the opportunity to prove me wrong. Well, I'm sorry I can't help you out. - You've got 24 hours to get outta here. - Are you serious? Where am I supposed to go? I don't care. I'm done. I just hope I don't fuck the new kid up too. [door opens and closes] [sighs] [cell phone buzzing] [Jenn] Eye drop delivery! I made us reservations for dim sum tomorrow at this place my mom's obsessed with. Prepare to have your mind blown. [Jenn sighs] [Jenn] Have you still not friended Tatiana? Sack up. Her husband is dead, - she lives in the US, and... - And she's happy. [Dasha] She has children, grandchildren. She takes cruises. I don't know if I want to upset that cart of fruit. Everyone seems happy on social media. Just today, I posted ten selfies, which would indicate that I'm living my best life instead of hobbling around in a body cast. Stop complaining! At least you have legs. I could have won Sectionals! [Jenn] Now I can't even go! Can I have a minute to wallow in the loss of my future career? No! It's tiresome. [sighs] What are you doing? Helping you out. "Hi, Tatiana. It's me, Dasha. Hit me back?!" First thing that came to mind. I haven't seen this woman in 40 years. And it'll be 40 more if it were up to you. I literally have no idea who I am or what I'm supposed to be doing anymore, but your destiny is still out there just waiting for you. At least one of us deserves to be happy. See you! [door opens] [door closes] - Morning! - Good morning! [Mitch] I made you beans on toast. [Carol] Oh, good. You look nice. Thanks! I just got off the phone with Mandy, and God knows, I wouldn't wish a preemie on anyone... As she's out of commission, she needs me to handle this big client today. I'm so excited, I could pee myself! That's great! - Not about the peeing, but... - [laughs] ...you deserve it. Thank you. Speaking of real estate, my Airstream rental contract is almost up, - and I was thinking that... - That you should move in here. I mean, I hadn't really thought about it, but... God! I mean, we're in a really good place. Why the fuck not? Let's do it! [stuttering] I was actually... going to ask you to be my real estate agent. Well, do you want to move in here? Um... I don't know. Can I think about it? Yeah. Uh... - Of course you c... Yes. - Hey... I will think about it. Okay. [Carol] Get some rest today, Kat! Love you, Serena! [door opens] Love you, too! [door closes] [camera clicking] [knocking on door] Just a sec! [Kat] Serena, what are you doing? I need to talk to you. [Serena] Just give me minute. - Do you ever wait? - Nope. How are you feeling? Tired. Stupid. You're first up for the short program. You okay with that? I mean, I'm landing everything, and that girl from Boise, the one with the triple axel, has shin splints, so she's out. Basically, it's mine to lose. [chuckles] And then on to Nationals. I'm really proud of you. Thanks. I'm sorry you're not skating. Yeah. But if we can keep this quiet, there's always next year, right? - [cell phone buzzing] - It's all about the long game. [buzzing continues] Okay, enough. Who's texting? Harley. Bullshit! You're a terrible liar. [scoffs] [sighs] Promise you won't tell Mom? I'm kind of... dating Drew. W... Wait. As in Justin's brother? Oh, okay. Which one's he? The dumb one - or the dumber one? - [laughs] Come on! He's nice. He's not that dumb. Who am I to give advice, anyway? Completely freaked my boyfriend out, and now he won't call me back. Well, you did throw a huge party in his room. Actually, it was more like a rager. A rager? Mom told me nobody saw anything. Mom didn't know. [sighs] [Dr. Parker] Like what I'm seeing. I knew it. I'm the Bionic Woman. So, basically, what you're saying is that I can skate again. Sorry. You should be ready to start physical therapy pretty soon, which means you won't be my patient anymore. So... do you drink coffee? Why? Is there some kind of healing property to caffeine? Because I'll inject it straight into my veins. - [chuckles] No! I was thinking, uh... - [laughs] More of a two people sitting across a table making awkward conversation sort of situation. Are you asking me out on a date? Obviously not very well. Oh! Uh... [both chuckle] Um... [clears throat] I, uh... I actually can't. Uh, okay. Jenn! - How's the hip? - It's shit. What are you doing here? I thought your wrist was getting better. Yeah, I just wanted to get it checked out once more before Sectionals, just in case. Serena, I can see you now. Bye, Jenn. I'll make sure the office gets you that referral. Give me all the shots. [Marcus] It's not even noon. You think I fucking care what time it is? [sighs] I just turned down a date with a really great guy who isn't drilling my ex-best friend. If he's so great, why'd you turn him down? Have you met me lately? I'm basically a failure with no self-esteem. Literally, the only bright spot in my life is that Kat has pneumonia and can't go to Sectionals either. Pneumonia? - [Jenn] Hm. - Huh. That sucks. I got you beat. I turned down medical school to ski, and then I got myself kicked off the ski team. What? When did that happen? Around the same time Kat got pneumonia. To shattered hips and shattered dreams. [cell phone buzzing] You know what? I think I'll join you. [Carol] Was I right, or was I right? There's not another property like it in Sun Valley. You'll have a wait list on every unit. [man] Mandy was not exaggerating. What do you mean? Well, I told her, "If you're not gonna show me around today, you'd better send your best." And she picked me. I get a sense about someone as soon as I meet 'em. I get a hell of a sense about you, Carol. And I have a hell of a sense that this is the right property for you. So much so that I drew up the offer papers. Oh, I thought you were just being a gentleman and showing me back to my hotel. [chuckles] Look, full disclosure, I'm also interested in some investment property in Park City and Vail. Which is why I have to convince you that Sun Valley's the right choice. Or maybe you should get me liquored up, and I'll be more interested in signing your papers. A bottle of champagne. [elevator bell chimes] [indistinct chatter] [laughter] [laughter continues] [man chuckling] - [man] Take that! - Kat! Hey. What are you doing out of bed? I thought you had pneumonia? - I've been trying to reach you. - Have you? Sorry, I've been kind of busy. Look, my sister told me I threw a rager the other night, and... I just need to know if anyone else saw me like that. Just the weird randos you invited over. Marcus and Alana kinda showed up later, too. [sighs] So they know too? I guess. Listen, I can't really talk about this right now. Kinda in the middle of my going-away party. You're going away? I mean, we definitely can't skate after what happened, and my dad is kicking me out after the rager I threw, so... I'm sorry. I wasn't myself, and... He and I were in a pretty good place there for a minute, but that all went to shit. Oh, well. - Justin, I... - It's cool. Anyway, you do you. I'll do me. - Good luck. - Wait... You're breaking up with me? [Justin] Hey, is it my turn yet? So... are you drunk enough to tell me what happened with the ski team? Nope. Fine. Then I gotta pee. [cell phone buzzing] [Jenn sighs] [phone clicks] What the hell? I saw that. Why the fuck did you miss the race? [Marcus] Dude, I'm at work! I overslept. What you told Coach is bullshit. Do you know that I vouched for you to even get on the team in the first place? You fucked up, right before we were supposed to train in Argentina this summer. - That makes me look bad. - Can't have that. [grunts] You startin' shit, but I'll be the one who pays for it. [Brent] Yeah, whatever. [elevator bell chimes] Marcus! [Kat] Hey, can we talk? Justin told me that you and Alana showed up to the party the other night. I was probably acting a little weird. A little weird? A lot weird. I don't know... I think maybe I just had too much to drink. That's not why. Alana has a cousin with the same thing. She figured it out. [sighs] Can we just keep this between us... and tell Alana to do the same thing? Please don't be mad at me. - You don't understand how hard this is. - You're right. I don't. Because you didn't give me that option. If you'd just told me the truth, maybe I could've helped out before shit got so fucked up. - I'm sorry... - For what? For getting me kicked off the ski team? Or maybe because I got arrested for trying to protect you. Or is it because I had to spend the entire weekend in jail because the judge didn't show up until Monday morning? Or... because the asshole you got into a fight with pressed charges. - Oh, my God. I... - Just... I gotta go. [Carol] All that's left to do is sign the papers. Oh, you need a pen. [elevator bell chimes] [slow beeping] I'm not a bad mother. I'm not a bad mother. [repeating] I'm not a bad mother. - We'll have to do this another time. - Is everything okay? What the hell do you think you're doing? People with pneumonia don't go walking around. [Carol] We have to get you out of here before anyone sees. You sure you don't wanna come? His dad's like a sheikh or something. Nah, you go ahead. I gotta get packed. - All right. Fine. - [man] Later! [Jenn] So Kat doesn't have pneumonia. - Oh, hey. - Did you know that? I don't know what that girl's up to anymore. She's your girlfriend and skating partner. Don't you think you should? Wait. Are you two broken up? Yeah, basically. Oh, my God. I can't believe I was obsessed with you. I'm gonna say yes to coffee. Wait. Are you leaving? Yeah. Because of Kat? You really liked her. [Jenn] Come here. Fucking Kat. Yeah. [Carol] I am not having this conversation right now. But if I'd just told Justin and Marcus the truth, then... Then they would have only walked away sooner. - Thanks. - I can't believe you went to the lodge where anyone could see you. You have no idea the shit that can happen if you don't manage the fallout after an episode. Okay, I've fucked up and done things that I can never take back. I don't want that to happen to you. You have to trust me on this. Remember, it's all about the long game. God! Oh, God. It's like pulling teeth with her. If this gets out, it won't be, "Olympic Champion, Kat Baker." It'll be, "That poor, crazy skater girl with bipolar disorder." God! How'd it go today with Serena? [Mitch] Uh... Could have been better. Serena's biggest competitor, Bethany Strokenfeld, is back in. What, that chick from Boise with the triple axel? I thought she had shin splints. Oh, she does. She told Serena, and I quote, "I am, like, totally hopped out on extra-strength ibuprofen. It's insane." Anyway, Serena's in her room texting up public sympathy. Well, good. Let her skate. Serena's gonna take that little bitch down. - [chuckles] - Thank you for driving her today. You made this shit day easier to handle. Of course. I... I know you're looking out for Kat, but, um... public perception is changing around mental health issues, even in sports. Not in figure skating. You know that. It's all about being perfect. I mean, the image is just as important as landing the jumps. When people find out, they can't walk away fast enough. I'm not running away. Well, you're not exactly moving in here, are you? We never even spoke about this until this morning. Let's talk about it now. Do you want to move in with me? There is middle ground between moving in and running away. Look, I'm not an idiot, Mitch. Okay? You saw me at my worst. It scared you. Admit it. No! I... I wanted time to think about it. Your disorder has nothing to do with that. What's your reason then? Oh, come on! Are you serious? You expect me to commit to a life together based on a random conversation over beans on toast? We haven't even said "I love you," for fuck's sake! Fine. I love you! There! Now what's your excuse? You should go. [door opens] [door closes] [knocking on door] Oh, good. You're here! I need your help. [Justin] Is everything okay? Is it your eyes? So if Kat messaged you "hello" after not speaking for 40 years, how would you respond? I'd probably say, "Fuck you, Kat." Why? Don't answer questions with questions, and watch your mouth. [sighs] Also, you cannot be mad at Katarina for being sick. She'll be better in a week and will skate again. Actually, uh... I'll be leaving town tomorrow for a while. Now that we're not going to Sectionals, I thought it'd be a good time. Where are you going? [sighs] I don't know. Anyways... thanks so much for everything, and, uh... Yeah. Justin... what is it you're not telling me? Nothing. I'll see ya. I'd probably say "hello" back. If that helps. [door opens] [knocking on door] - I would like to see Katarina. - What? You can't just walk in here! Yes, I can. Are you really sick, Katarina? - Of course she's sick. Look at her! - I'm talking to your daughter, not you. Do you have pneumonia? I'm giving you one more chance to tell me the truth. For your safety and the safety of your partner, the relationship between coach and student must be based on total trust. I have pneumonia. That's too bad. I had such hopes for you. I'm no longer your coach. What? Good! Maybe if she had a better coach, she wouldn't have got pneumonia. [door closes] [Carol] It's fine. Okay? You survived losing Vicky and Liz. You'll survive the Russian. [cell phone buzzing] Shit. I gotta take this, but I'll be back to check on you in a little bit, okay? Maybe we'll do our nails. [sighs] Hi, Mandy. Look, I fucked up. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have just left like that. [Serena] Is it true Kat's blood went so deep they finally had to cut out a whole section of the ice? What? No! Who told you that? Bethany. She said that I'm brave for skating where Kat cracked her skull open. She thinks that our family's cursed. Mandy, can you just give me one second? Our family is fine. Okay? Bethany is trying to psych you out because she doesn't want you to beat her. What if I freak out? [sighs] Oh, my God! I just wish Kat never fell. And you think I don't? Now, go pack for Sectionals. I gotta finish this call. Hey. I'm sorry, Mandy. Kat was coughing. No, honestly, it's been horrible. [footsteps approaching] This fucking day. [Alana] Hmm. A guest complained to me that her toast wasn't toasted enough, and I had to pretend to care. Kind of like you're doing right now. So, did you talk to your coach? And say what? That I had the wrong day marked on my calendar? Or that I got so sick that I couldn't even call? There's nothing I can say that'll make it okay. You could try the truth. [scoffs] Okay. Yeah. "Hey, Coach. I got arrested for punching a drug addict in the middle of a rager, but it's not my fault." It's been a hard week on both of us. I didn't do anything. I know you didn't. No matter how hard I work, no matter how much I accomplish, at the end of the day, I'm just another black man who landed himself in jail. Marcus... You ran in there without even thinking about it to help your friend. - You did the right thing. - [laughs] Look what good it did me. I'm scared. [Dr. Parker] So, I reset the bone, and I made a splint out of sticks. - [both laughing] - My mom... told the doctor what I'd done for my brother, and he looked me in the eye, and he said, "Kid..." I'm paying for you - "to go to medical school." - Whoa! Are you serious? He was also my dad. Oh! - That helped. - [laughing] [cell phone buzzing] - [clears throat] - Is that the standard emergency call to get you out of here if I was too boring? - [laughs] No! - [phone continues buzzing] I have a couple of concierge patients who need a lot of reassurance, but I am finally hanging out with someone I've kinda had a crush on for a very long time, so... it can wait. I'm really glad you called. Me too. So... [sighs] I wanna hear more about Grandma Yu. Is that your mom's or dad's side? Uh... both. Did I not mention my parents are brother and sister? It's why I have bad hips. [both laughing] That's... No, no. That's cool. If that's the story you want to go with, that's fine. [laughs] I made you some hot cocoa. What are you doing? Justin and I are still on the schedule. Well, of course you are. It made it more believable that you had pneumonia. That's what I thought. You're a genius. But you can't skate. - You're still adjusting to your lithium. - I've skated tired before. Not after an episode. You're not thinking rationally. Look, it's perfect. Okay? I'll find Justin and Dasha. I'll tell them I'm feeling better. I'll say I'm sorry. I'll beg them to forgive me. No one at the competition will know I'm bipolar, and we can go through our routine tonight. - I'll be ready. - No. Okay? It's too dangerous. You can go to Sectionals next year. Not without a coach, Mom, and not without a partner. If I don't do this, it's all over! There's no point in keeping this huge secret if I can't skate. Kat, please. Why are you so obsessed with me not going? The last time you were at that rink, you almost fucking died! Look, I know I shouldn't yell. It's just... I can't... I can't bear for anything else to happen to you. Okay? And if you see where you fell and you're not fully yourself yet, it could take you back. - You have to think of the long... - The long game. I know. I'm sorry, Mom. I'm going. You can't stop me. Look, I will lock you in this house for the rest of your entire life if I have to. [Carol] Hey! That's it. - I'm not going with Serena to Sectionals. - [Serena] What? You're not gonna be there? I could win this weekend. I could go on to Nationals. Serena, honey, let's just stop thinking about yourself for a second. You have no idea what it's like to live with mental illness. Yes, I do. I'm the one that suffers whenever you or Kat goes crazy. This will never end for me, will it? She's just as fucked up as you are, and she's never not gonna be fucked up. Serena! I'm tired of it, Kat. Of being second, of no one ever giving a fuck about me! Oh, please! Of keeping your stupid secrets! Ask Mom why Vicky made you change your lutz at the last minute. Shut up, Serena! Vicky didn't want to. She said that it was too risky to lift your arms. Wait. What are you talking about? - Mom said she'd fire her... - Shut up! ...if she didn't make you do it. Stop, Mom! [Serena] I was there! Okay? I heard everything. [Serena] It's your fault she fell. [beeping] When Kat wakes up, we're going to tell her that Vicky made her do it. Do you understand me? Hey. Promise me that you're never gonna tell her. Promise me! Guess the secret's out now, huh, Mom? Look, I am so, so sorry. I... I didn't take my meds that day, and I wasn't thinking clearly. You had to have known that lifting my arms at the last second would throw off my lutz. I never practiced it like that. You knew that was dangerous! You weren't gonna win if you didn't have those points! I did it for you. I never meant for you to get hurt. Everything went wrong after that fall! You're a bad mother. [door opens] [door slams] [Kat] Dear Dasha... I want you to know who I am. No more hiding. No more secrets. You were right. I don't have pneumonia. But I was sick. I have bipolar disorder. I was scared that if you knew the truth, Marcus, that's all you'd see me as... a girl with a mental disorder. I thought that if I stopped taking my meds, we could win, but I was putting you in danger. You gave me your trust, but I didn't deserve it, Justin. I just hope you can forgive me. I kept my secret because I didn't want anything to change between us, Jenn. But by not telling you the truth, that's exactly what happened. I don't remember everything that happened during my mania, but I do know that... even at my worst, Justin was there for me. I just thought you needed to know that. Thank you for telling me. I should, um... I should go talk to my son, huh? [James sighs] [Marcus] My guy! All right, man. I'm outta here. - [man] Do your thing. - [Marcus chuckles] [Marcus laughs] - [Kat] You're back on the ski team? - Yeah. You know, your note made me realize I should tell my coach the truth about why I missed the race. I leave for Argentina tomorrow morning. I've got to keep training if I'm gonna have any chance of making it to the Olympics. And what did Alana say? "Took you long enough." [both laugh] So I guess this is goodbye. I'm happy for you. Me too. I'll see you in the fall. Hi. Hi. Bipolar. That's a big word. I know. Not gonna lie, I've got a lot of questions. [sighs] Ask me anything. This is why you disappeared last year. So... when did this start happening? [knocking on door] Can I come in? It's your hotel, right? You, uh... come to check up on me? Don't worry. I'll be out of here in the morning. Uh... Kat... came to see me. She told me everything. Um... I'm sorry... for what I said to you earlier. You remind me so goddamn much of your mother. The twins, they're... they're all me... straightforward, rough around the edges... but you're your mother's son. I look at you, I see her. I said things to you that I shouldn't have 'cause I was so angry at her for leaving me. For leaving you. What you did for Kat, protecting her, that's your mother's goodness. Her self-sacrifice. But if I could've got over my anger, I would have seen that in you sooner. [Justin tuts] So, uh... you still want me out in the morning, or... [James laughs] Yeah, of course you can stay... for now. Hey... You gotta talk to Kat. You can't be mad at her for being sick. It's not why I'm upset, Dad. Do you have kids? I do. Best fucking thing I ever did. [man] Look who's back. Yes, hi. Sorry I had to rush off like that. It was... There was something... - personal I had to deal with. - Oh. Not a boyfriend, I hope. No. Nope, not at all. No boyfriend. Then what do you say we finish that drink? Yeah. Everything is so fucked up with my family, and Sectionals is a disaster, and I didn't have anyone else to talk to, and I just really wanted to see you. Feels like we had sex, and then you didn't wanna hear from me anymore. And why haven't you been answering me? I'm so sorry, Serena. I... I was in surgery all afternoon. I... [sighs] One of my patients got in a skiing accident. Oh. Sorry I got weird. Tomorrow's supposed to be the best day of my life, and it just feels like everything's falling apart. I wish you could come watch me skate, you know? Okay. Okay? [laughs] - Really? - Yeah. You would do that? I'll say I'm there for a patient. I'm so lucky I have you. Okay. I should get you home. You've got a big day tomorrow. Yeah, please buckle up. Thank you. [engine starts] [knocking on door] Is Kat here? I'll be upstairs. I'm so sorry. I know. Can we still skate together? It can be like nothing ever happened. Except it won't, Kat. Not really. When did you stop taking your meds? Was it before the night when you wanted to change our program before Regionals? What? 'Cause that's the night you said you loved me. Did you mean it, or... was it just a part of your mania? Justin... 'Cause I meant it. I don't know. [Justin inhales deeply and sighs] [door opens] [door closes]
