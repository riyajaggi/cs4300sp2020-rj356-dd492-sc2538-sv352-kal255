 ♪ Whatever the cost ♪ ♪ I'm good for it ♪ Please welcome to the ice our Pinecrest skating pro Katarina Baker. Get it, girl! - Kill it! - Go for gold, Kat! Bring it home! Yeah! Serena! Up! - How are you so awake? - ♪ We're all in this together ♪ ♪ Through the thick and thin ♪ ♪ We're all in this together ♪ ♪ In the losses and the wins ♪ ♪ In the light of day ♪ ♪ There's always a place to love the world we share... ♪ It's too early. Come here. ♪ We'll find each other there... ♪ - Is it really that bad? - Yeah. - Did you look in the mirror this morning? - No! Am I beautiful now? Gorgeous. How are my wonderful girls this morning? - Exhausted. - Fine. Serena, why aren't you eating? It's so early. If I eat, I'm gonna puke. What did Mitch say about getting enough protein? Eat it. Mom. And I hope you've been practicing your triple toe like you promised him. Because I overheard Nancy talking to the moms yesterday, and they said you're still wrapping. Show me. Show me. Good. Chin up. Look, I know Nancy can be a cunt, but you've gotta stop doing that. Can't hold on to bad habits. Whatever. Her daughter sucks. You know Emily cheats her triple toe. She's fat. Time to go. Remember, a flying spin, a spin combo, and don't even think about popping your double axel or a single one of those four double jumps. I read the rule book, Mom. Well, good because... Liz isn't gonna be there tonight. What do you mean? Well, you don't need a coach to hold your hand for an easy test. Especially Liz. A senior test isn't easy. Oh, come on. You'll pass it. If you didn't, it'd be... If I'm gonna coach, I need to pass this test. And if I'm gonna pass this test, I need Liz there. Well, I'm sorry, but I just can't afford to pay for both of your coaching anymore. Hey, Marcus! Hey. Were you wearing that shirt last time I saw you? Uh, me and my boys went skiing last night. Decided to camp up there so we could get first tracks on the pow this morning. Pow? You mean powder. You right. That's the whitest shit I ever said. You bring it out of me. Hey, good to see you. I'll see you later? Yeah. Do your thing out there. I'm not trying to be mean. I just... Seriously. I'm not kidding. I'm not kidding! It's so bad! ♪ Think of all that you'd be missing ♪ ♪ Prescription made ♪ ♪ Painkillers ♪ ♪ Count your blessings early ♪ ♪ Before the lot'll hit the gates ♪ ♪ Winnings for the lucky living just takes ♪ ♪ Painkillers ♪ ♪ Think of all that you'd be missing Prescription made ♪ ♪ Painkillers ♪ What the fuck happened to you? Nothing. Just Justin being a... Did he hit on you? Jealous. Talented, hot, and rich. God, I wish he'd wise up and fuck me. You know Basic Bitch is his third partner in three years? It'll be out with the old, in with the new any day now. Are you telling me that you want to skate with him? Pair skating? I trust no man to throw me five feet in the air going 20 miles an hour. That shit's a death wish. You know she's banging him. Really? I don't know. I feel sorry for Natalie. - She has to put up with him. - Hm. - How are we doing? - Hi! Hey... How's it healing? Oh, Jenn... It's fine. I caught up on a full season of Stranger Things. I told you guys I was right! All right, Serena. No more selfies. Once that Zamboni's off, I want you stepping on the ice. - You hear me? - Yes. How long has Serena been training with him? A week. I guess he approached her at that training camp. Mom fired Sharon after coaching Serena for ten years. Carol, you cold-hearted minx. Yup. I'm coachless, and she gets the former Olympian. Only the best for Idaho's golden child. Lucky. What a bitch. - That's my sister you're talking about. - And? Your sister's a bitch. Serena becomes a senior this summer, and now I'm coming in second as she's waving on top of the podium. Remember, strong line. You're so lucky you don't have to compete against her. Dude, I'm so sorry. It's fine. It's totally fine. All I'm focused on right now is passing my senior test. Right, get out. Come on. Come on! Go! Off you go. Spin down. Keep spinning. ♪ Hey, you're the comeback kid ♪ ♪ See me look away ♪ ♪ I'm the runaway ♪ ♪ I'm the stay out late ♪ ♪ I'm recovering ♪ ♪ Kid ♪ ♪ At the top of our street ♪ ♪ I was somewhat like him ♪ ♪ I was somebody ♪ ♪ Comeback kid ♪ ♪ Comeback kid ♪ ♪ Comeback kid ♪ ♪ Let me look at you ♪ Does your sister always pop her jumps like that? - Yeah. - Hm. She usually chickens out at the last second. Pity. She's a beautiful skater. Come on. Triple toe. Go on. Get out there. What the hell are you doing? Did you not see me there? Seriously, Kat? You weren't even gonna try! You never do! Excuse me? Just saying, maybe it's time you get out of the way! Serena, wh... Holy shit! It went through her foot. - Holy shit! - I can't get it out! Oh, my God! Somebody call an ambulance! It went through her foot! Get her off the ice right now! I can't get it out! You'll be all right. Come here. Come this way. Lift. Breathe. Breathe. God! Poor Natalie. I know. It took the EMT a full minute to get that blade out of her foot. - She'll be off the ice for months. - Uh! I mean, that's why I come here every day. If Emily ever had a fall like that, at least I could be with her on the way to the hospital. Oh, don't worry, Nance. Emily can't jump high enough to get that kind of injury. When I heard what happened, I was sure it had something to do with Justin acting up again. There's a first time for everything. - Stupid women. - Ugh! You're really coming along on your triple toe, honey. - Thank you, Mom. - Finally. Honestly, it's taken a lot of retraining out of some bad habits. I'm lucky she's so talented, and I have you to thank for that. Well, I'm just so happy that you agreed to come teach here. - You're putting us back on the map. - No. Please, you're too kind. - All right. Well, nice chatting. - Yeah. - Ladies. Um, let's talk soon, Carol. - Yeah. Good double axel, honey. Could be quicker on the landing. You should be watching Serena's axels. She's always very quick twitch. In, out. - Hey, Mom. - Hi, Carol. Hi, sweetheart. Are you ready for your test? Yup. I could whack her knee with a bat. Or is that too '90s? You want me to be there tonight? Better if I'm alone for this one. Katarina Baker! Shit. Come on. One, two, three, four... Oh, come on. You failed. Jesus! What are you doing here? You should not be popping such a simple jump as a double lutz. The story is your coach made you lift your arms on the triple at the last minute. That's why you fail. You don't talk much. That's good. And you're a beautiful skater. I hear a rumor that you'd given it up. Mistake, I think. You should skate with Justin. You have a very strong upper body, perfect for pair skating. I will help you pass some tests. Show you how to do throws. Teach you how to jump again. - You'll be great. - I know how to jump. I just don't. I remember... you land all your triple jumps consistently not so long ago. Now you're just a little scared. I'm not a little scared. I'm terrified. I can fix you. No one starts pair skating at 21. I'm not afraid of a challenge. Justin already has a partner. Not anymore. She quit. You give me two years, I will give you Nationals. And then we'll see... how far you can go. I'm not a pair skater. ♪ Everything ♪ ♪ Goes so slowly now ♪ ♪ Everything ♪ ♪ Stops for a minute ♪ ♪ Everything ♪ ♪ Goes so slowly now ♪ ♪ Time now seems to vanish... ♪ Sorry. Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were at your test. I failed. I'm sorry. It's just been a while since... It's okay. - Can I... - No. I'm fine. Just a... difficult night. I'm glad I'm here, though. You've been biting again? Are you feeling okay? I'm fine. That sport is crazy-making. You don't have to worry about that anymore. The next test is in six months, and I can't afford to wait that long. I have no choice. I gotta quit. So... I applied to this fellowship last year in London, and it didn't look like it was gonna pan out. But then I got the news this morning that it's happening. I'm leaving in a week. - Wh... - And I want you to come with me. What? Come on. You're quitting anyway. This is your chance to just... go live for a while. Just promise me that you'll think about it. You know, I can't believe it's all finally over. I always thought I'd make my mark, you know? After all the years of training... I thought I'd see it through to the end. The end? I wanted to be remembered. Up! What time is it? Did you not hear me? Get up! God, this room is filthy! Serena! Serena? Mom woke me up. She told me I have to do 30 laps around the block if I want to make Worlds. Shit! Okay. I'm on my way. Serena? Mom. Putting in my notice at the airport tomorrow, so I can focus full time on Serena's training. And the night shift's just too much. You stopped taking your meds. How dare you. After all I've sacrificed? If I hadn't gotten pregnant with you, I would've gone to the Olympics! There's not a day I don't think about that! I know. - Now settle down. - Leave me alone! Look! Look at what you're doing to her! You're not healthy right now! You're hurting her! Do you hear me? Yes. I'm gonna get your lithium. You're gonna take it while I watch. Okay? You okay? I think I re-sprained my wrist. Go inside, put some ice on it, take a shower, get into bed. I'll call Dr. Parker in the morning. I'll come back and check on you, okay? Thank you for coming. Come on. Sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Me too. Hey! You look tired. Thanks. I've got a lot on my plate. Well, follow my lead. I put up with these rich-ass people just so I can save up for my lift passes and ski with my boys. I keep life simple. Whatever you're doing seems complicated. Well, it's about to get a lot less complicated. I quit skating. And I'm thinking about moving to London with Dave. No! I mean, I don't think you should. Why? Um... Watch your back. Sit down, everybody! - Hey, kid. - Good to see you too, sir. Looks like the owners are here. They're in your section. Great. I should get out there. Kat Baker! I heard you were working today. How you doin', sweetheart? I'm good, thanks. What can I get you guys? - I'll have a beer. - Shut up, Reid. Strawberry daiquiri with a lot of rum, please. Dasha tells me that you may be my son's new partner. - Dad. - Did she? Well, I'm actually quitting. Listen, I understand money's a little tight right now, so I'd like to help you out with that. Just think, instead of taking drink orders from my guests, I'd be paying you to do something you love. Either way, the money's coming from the same place. She's heard you, honey. Let's give her some time to think, maybe. Okay. Okay. Listen, I'm not trying to strong-arm you. It's just, you know, when my late wife first got Justin into figure skating, I was a little worried he might turn into some kind of a fruitcake. But, you know, she saw something in him, and it turns out she was right. My boy has Olympic-size talent. He just needs a partner now who can match that. Think it over. Uh... Beautiful. - I'm suddenly in the mood for champagne. - Ooh! Bring us a bottle of my good stuff. Of course. Right away. I think we may have gotten through to her. Kat! You got a second, honey? Sure. Mandy. Right. I remember. Look, I just wanted to apologize for my husband. He really is a good person. You don't have to. It's fine. No, it wasn't fine. He put you on the spot, and I saw your face, and you looked like you were about to kill him. If I didn't love that man so much, I'd wanna kill him too. Okay, so I know Justin is a goddamn pain in the ass, and I wish him on no woman, but I also know he is the real deal. And that boy has a gift. So I keep hearing. Don't worry. I'm not trying to sell you on him again. And it's not my place to tell you what to do... but if you do choose to partner with Justin, just know that you've got an ally in me. Thanks. All right. I'd better get back in there before James starts to wonder what's taking me so long in the bathroom. Thanks! Hey. Hey. Where's Mom? She's in bed. I had her take a sedative and call into work sick. Why are you suddenly wearing eyeliner? Who drove you home? Mitch. I thought he was gonna tell me to stay home because of my wrist, but he had me doing off-ice training literally all day long. He drove you home? Serena, I don't like the way he acts around you. What are you talking about? I saw him slap your ass with his gloves the other day. Oh, my God. It was a joke. Serena, you really have to be careful about who you trust. Have you ever thought that after everything that has happened with you and Mom, Mitch is the only person in my life I can trust? Are you serious right now? I'm just trying to look out for you. Honestly? I think you're doing this because you're jealous. Your Olympic dreams are over, and mine are just beginning. The best that you could've hoped for was coaching. But now that you've failed your test, you can't even do that. So, of course, you're trying to screw up my training by attacking Mitch. Why do you always have to be such a little bitch, Serena? Everyone thinks you're this saint. But it's obvious now. You are just as messed up and bipolar as she is. That's so unfair. I've been able to manage it. She hasn't.

What you just did, that was remarkable. Here... My contact information. For when you change your mind. Thanks, but I'm done. That was my last skate. You should talk to my sister. Serena's better than I am. She's the one you want. Yeah. Yeah, she's more consistent. More powerful. But you have "it"... in a way your sister never will. You have magic there, girl. You deserve to be remembered. Thanks. I gotta go to work. I'm ready for good news. Your only option is to get off that leg and rehab it for at least three months. Regionals is in three months. Not gonna happen. If you don't rest your hip now, you're not just gonna have trouble skating. You could have trouble walking. ♪ It's why we're going up and down... ♪ Okay, I'm out. See you later. I heard you failed. Yeah. That sucks. I also heard... we're going out tonight. I know I could use a drink. Come on! Let's go. Let's go. Come on! Come on! We're gonna have so much fun! You look great. - We're gonna have a lot of fun, okay? - Welcome. Let's get you some drinks. That would be great, thank you. Oh! You're a pro, apparently. Bottle service? Who's paying for all this? Not you. I think I'll need one more. It'll help numb the pain of knowing you're moving to London. Oh, I have something for you. I found it when I was cleaning the house the other day. Wow! I can't believe you still have this. Look how happy we look. Your dress is ugly. Yeah, it was. Remember what we promised each other that summer? - Uh... - Olympics or die! Seems like a reasonable motto when you're nine. But things change. - Kat... - Look, I know what you're trying to do. I'm not gonna stay, okay? I can't even pass my senior test. I really don't think you should give it all up. Don't throw away an opportunity. What opportunity are you talking about exactly? To be Justin's partner. How the hell do you even know about that? Come on! I know everything that happens at that stupid rink. I don't understand why everyone suddenly thinks this is a good idea. Do it for that little girl. Wrong girl. I'll be right back. Hello. Guys, give me a second. Thanks for talking to her for me. Not sure it's gonna work, but I did my best. Thanks for the table. I like sharing the wealth. Cheers. You have a good night. - Oops. - Hey. Kat Baker, are you drunk? Hey. What's up? She just had a little too much to drink. If you ever hurt my sister, if you touch her, I will kill you. I... Lacey's cool. It's such bullshit. You guys wanna go to Jimmy's after this? - Kat! - Not now! Maybe stop pretending like you hate me. - Stop messing with me! - Whoa there. I don't know what game you're playing, but just stop. I'm not. I just think we'd work well together. Why? 'Cause, unlike what everybody thinks, I actually do care about skating. And I want to win. So you had your dad try and buy me? Do you know how humiliating that was for me? - It's just how he does things. - Great. And don't tell me you couldn't use the help. I will never take a handout from you. Ever. Kat... Hey. Hey! Help yourselves. It's on my dad. That way. Should you really be out on a school night? What do you mean? Well, I heard you're a skater. Isn't this thing kinda frowned upon? They can't frown upon anything they don't know about. Cheers. Mom. Just got off the phone with Mitch. He was telling me that you were drunk and acting inappropriate at some bar. I don't trust him around Serena. What? It's the way he... he touches her, you know? It's an instinct. Something's not right, Mom. An instinct, honey? Look, I am so sorry that I've put you through all of this lately. I know my episodes can trigger yours. If you haven't been taking your meds... Mom, come on. You know what I'm talking about. This happened to you. God, I wish I hadn't told you that. That was complicated, okay? Look, sometimes you and me, we just... we can't trust ourselves, honey. Every day, I wish you didn't get my brain, but you did. And so you have to be very careful when you get these "instincts." I'm not having an episode. Well, it's looking a lot like it did last time. You don't get to do this. I'm done with this! Where are you going? I'm gonna go live in London with Dave. London? I thought you were gonna pass your senior test? You were there. You saw what happened. Well, you can take it again in six months. Why do you suddenly care about me becoming a coach so much? Do you seriously think I wanted you to become a coach? I wanted you to pass so that you could put everything that happened to you behind you. Never gonna happen. Get back on the competition track where you belong. You and me, Kat, we're the same... always tripping at the finish line. God, I wish we had Serena's toughness. I really do. There is no "we." I'm not gonna lose three jobs in three years 'cause I keep forgetting to take my meds. I'm not gonna sleep with losers who throw me away after one night! I'm not gonna train my children so hard, my youngest ends up in the emergency room! There is no "we!" Yeah, if I'm so horrible, then why did I drive you to 5:00 a.m. practice every day for fucking ten years? Why did I fight to get you all the best coaches... and work overtime every chance I could get so that you could have ice time and pay for your medical bills after your fall? Don't try and make this about me! This has always been about you! You just can't stand to let Serena have a turn in the spotlight, can you? Maybe you should go. Go. Mom? What are you doing? Everything I worked for with Kat is garbage, so I threw it away. She's gone. It's okay. There she is. Leah! Justin... Leah Starnes. Nice to meet you. This is my son. This is the guy I told you about. Leah just moved here from Seattle, and she's in the market for a new partner. And, lucky for us, her and her family just happen to be staying with us here at the lodge. Hi. Lucky.
