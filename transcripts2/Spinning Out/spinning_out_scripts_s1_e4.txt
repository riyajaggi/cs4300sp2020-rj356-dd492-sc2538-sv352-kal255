 ♪ Put it on my tab ♪ ♪ Whatever the cost ♪ ♪ I'm good for it ♪ So your mom lives here now. Yeah, apparently. It's fine. I'm ignoring her. Ask you what about keeping Pinecrest wild? The annual Davis family fundraiser. The money raised goes to preserve wildlife and protect this mountain against developers. Except for my dad, of course. Sounds like a blast. You like these shirts? Mandy also made us matching hats. God, she bugs me. Let's just skate. Okay. So Dasha wants us to work on the opening of "Romeo and Juliet." Smooth out our strokes into the overhead lift. And remember, dorogaya... you are in love. - I can't promise a miracle. - Yeah, yeah. Slow down. Not that slow! Ugh! You know, there's this thing in pair skating called another person. Thank you. I didn't realize. You need to get better at tracking me, Kat. I'm trying, okay? I'm just... I'm used to skating alone. I need time to adjust. I'm not trying to freak you out, but our senior pair test is in two weeks. If we don't pass, we don't compete at Regionals. Our whole competition season will be done. Look, just... How do I learn? I don't know. It's just instinctive. It's about being in sync, anticipating, knowing what's in the other person's head without them having to say anything. It's like having really great s... Okay. Yeah, I get it. Give me a second. Okay. How am I supposed to focus with you staring at me? What are you even doing here? Shouldn't you be at work? It's Friday. Well, I'm only working the night shift now so I can be here for your sister. Serena's not even on the ice. You never did want me to watch you skate. Serena always begged for me to be here, but you never did. You like to be alone. What are you even saying? I just... I don't know if you're a pair skater, honey. I mean, you can't even track your partner. I'm learning. I can learn. I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I don't think you can learn to connect with someone. Isn't tracking basically that? It's okay. You're a lone wolf. Just like me. What are you doing? Why are you even saying this to me? - Because I care about you. - Bullshit! The only thing you care about is you. You always put yourself first. Always. If that's what you need to believe... Fuck this. I am gonna learn how to track. Just stop staring at me. Okay? Kat, you okay? Yeah, fine. Mom's just in my head again. It's okay. Have a good skate. Just in case it wasn't clear, this is stupid. You've done far stupider things. I've purposely missed acting class for skaters five years in a row now. Thanks for ruining my streak. We'll survive. We've gotta learn to connect. This is how we're gonna do it. Just mirroring right now. Tracking each other. Remember to keep a nice, continuous rhythm. I'm sorry, but I don't feel like being forced to emote or whatever. Now I'm annoyed that I had to say "emote." Justin, I need this to work. Please. Okay, good. Now it's time for the Meisner technique. The next piece is for you and your partner to connect emotionally. So one of you will start by saying whatever's going on between you right now, and the other will repeat it. Eventually, the words are gonna fade into the background, and the emotions will just take over. Have a go. Okay, so what is happening right now is... you look unhappy. I look unhappy. Because you're having trouble tracking me. Because I'm having trouble tracking you. Or connecting on the ice. Or connecting on the ice. And I can't figure out why. You can't figure out why. 'Cause usually, I connect with everyone. Everyone you fuck? - Everyone except you, apparently. - Uh, okay. Maybe this would work better if you tried not to be so... - So what? - I don't know. Like you're being right now. Shutting me out, like you do with everybody. Like... Like I'm a lone wolf? Fuck my mother. - Fuck you! - What? - What the fuck are you talking about? - You're right. - This is stupid. - Kat. - Hi, ladies. - Hey, hey, hey. You know that digging you asked me to do on Mitch? - Ssh! - Greater edges! Right, sorry. Well, I talked to my source in Boise. This girl would only need one glass of cab before she spilled state secrets. Oh, speaking of, did you see that Hutchins finally expanded their wine section? - Now we don't have to drive... - Focus! What's the deal with Mitch? Turns out he's a saint. His student back in Boise, the one who dropped him, it's because she got an eating disorder and not the good kind. I already knew that. - Strong landing! - What else? Well, a few weeks after that, he finds out his wife's stepping out on him with some plumber or something. So his wife's the cheater? Yup. In the same month, he loses his best skater and his wife. Very sad. Very, very sad. Yeah, the saddest. So that's it? Nothing else? Nothing else. Why are you so interested in Mitch? Holy shit! Did Serena just land a triple flip double toe? Harley didn't even tell me she was working on that. I guess all the money I'm giving Mitch is paying off. She was falling on that last week. Jenn. Wow. Okay, then. I'm going to the bathroom. Hey, nice double axel. Um, nice triple flip double toe. Yeah, wow, Serena. You're just a little jumping bean out there. - Thank you. - You know, we were all worried about your artistic score dragging you down, but those jumps of yours will really help make up for that. See you tomorrow, honey. Come on. I promise I can make a decision. Can I just get till the end of the day, please? Thank you. Argh! Whoa! Hey! - That is definitely not stable. - It's okay. Got it. Here. So, are you skiing in the fundraiser this year? I raised 10K for the ski-a-thon portion already. - I guess I'm very sponsorable. - I believe it. And we make a pretty good team. - You think? - I think. Hey. You wanna go to this thing with me? I can watch you ski. It could be fun. Nah, it's okay. It's okay? Kat, I've asked you to come watch me ski before. I've asked you out before. And even when you say yes, you don't show up. It happened again at Justin's party. I just feel like you're gaslighting me here. Well... okay. I'm gonna go get the other sign. So my mom was right. I shut everybody out. My skating partner, my best friend, even Marcus. I guess what I'm saying is, I'm gonna die alone. That's the kind of all-or-nothing mentality we try to avoid. There's a middle ground, isn't there? With my mom? With bipolar? I don't see it. Well, let's be clear. The boundaries you set for yourself aren't because of your bipolar disorder. Well, it certainly doesn't help. Kat, the challenge of being raised by your mother is why you needed to protect yourself. But you're an adult. You're out of your mom's house now. You can stop shutting yourself off from people. Yeah. I mean, she might be out of her mom's house, but even when Carol's not there, she's still gotta be in Kat's head. Thank you. Thanks, Alison. Now, the point that I was getting to is that... you can't let a coping mechanism become something you hide behind. You deserve a real connection in your life. Just start with a few baby steps. Like what? You know. Propose marriage. Move in together. That's what I do. Like open yourself up. Just a little bit. Reach out to someone. I tried. He turned me down. That's probably 'cause he was scared too. You're not the only one who's afraid of connecting. Get ready for our next event, the men's super G. Ring a cowbell for your favorite skier! And don't forget to check out the silent auction back at the lodge. All proceeds go to the Keep Pinecrest Wild foundation. Kat Baker! Wow! I didn't expect to see you out here. I'm trying something new. Well, it looks good on you. Hey, thanks for being so great with Justin. I've never seen him work this hard. Oh. It's okay. Here, have a cowbell. Reid! Drew! Are y'all drinking the charity beer? Oh, that is it! You are out of here! I'm sorry, I've gotta go whoop some ass. Tell me you haven't been in here training for the last three hours because of the "fuck you" sandwich that mom-jean-wearing bitch delivered yesterday? You wouldn't understand. You're right. I'm not a skater. I don't train with you every day. I'm just here for the fluorescent lighting and the assholes. I'm in a trial period. Mitch could leave at any minute, and if Mary-Ann is right about my artistic scores, then I'm screwed. Mary-Ann wouldn't know artistry if it bit her in the face. Come to think of it, it kinda looks like something bit her in her face. Yeah, totally. Honestly, I hate telling you this because you're my fucking competition, but the only reason Mary-Ann insulted you was... because you've become a threat. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, if my dad found out how good you were getting, he'd lose his shit too and... Whatever. We're all super pissed about it, okay? So just stop freaking out and own it. Can we get the produce manager out here? Thanks. Can I get a cashier to aisle two. Aisle two. Got another card? Could you just cover me? You know I'm good for it. Sorry. My boss won't let me do that anymore. - Carol. - Hey. It's a nice surprise. Fancy running into you here. - Well, we all have to eat. - Hm. It just feels so good to help someone in need, doesn't it, Lisa? Can you believe that Serena's triple lutz was fully rotated this morning? Just a few weeks ago, she was... I'm sorry. I know I promised I'd stay out of it. It's... It's fine. In fact, if it would make you more comfortable, I'm more than happy to... Thank you. ...give you a regular progress report, or... In fact, I was gon... Do you want to grab a coffee? Like, right now? Yeah. You can tell me about your own skating days. Well... I should probably get back. Well, you know, screw it. Let's do it. Up next in the final round of the day is Marcus Holmes. Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Yes! Yes, dude! And the winner, with the fastest time of the day, is Marcus Holmes! - Hey, you just relax. I've got your skis. - Thanks, bro. Yeah, no problem. Marcus! - Why didn't you tell me how good you are? - I did. Several times. Almost every day. No, you're crazy good. Thank you. I showed up. I see that. Dude, Coach just said he wants you to start training with us. That's amazing! No. I just came out here to ski for fun. Look, I've been blowing off ski coaches since college. Why stop now, right? Uh... because you could keep having fun and go to the Olympics? At least give yourself a chance to qualify. - It's just not an option for me. - Why not? It's just not. Will you talk to your boyfriend? Don't let him be an idiot. Think about it. For the record, I did not tell him you're my girlfriend. Liar. Sorry I'm being weird. It's, uh... It'scomplicated. It's okay. We both have our stuff. If we talked about it all today, we'd probably be here for a week. ♪ Jack, the whistle, and the hammer ♪ ♪ Jack, the whistle, and the hammer... ♪ You did not! I did! I called the cops! She was screaming at me during practice, waving a can of mace! God! Those Boise women, I tell you, they're a different breed. Oh, I understand that only too well. That's right. You were married to one. How do you know that? But you told me that when we first met, remember? Right. Well, um... She was a... Ah, no, no, no. I'm pretty sure I'm not supposed to talk about my ex-wife on a date with another woman. This is a date? I guess that's up to you. Well, you're paying, right? Okay. Suffice it to say that my wife... found another man, and I found them on our brand new 800-thread-count sheets. Yeah. Well, you didn't deserve that. We were supposed to be talking about you and your illustrious skating career. Most skating moms... don't know their lutzes from their salchows. Yeah, I bled through my skates for years. I gave it everything I had. The rink was... I don't know. It was... the only place I felt like I had complete control. Or at least I thought I did, and... I thought skating would be my ticket out. So why'd you stop? - Uh... - Another round? - What do you say? Another round? - Um... Yeah. Sure. Okay. Down the rabbit hole. Next up, the women's downhill. It's good, right? What was my life like before this pretzel? - I dunno. - Get a free beer at Jimmy's... Hey, there's Yu. Hang on a sec. Hey, Jenn. Those Völkls you sold me last month, - the ones with the rocker tips... - Hm-mm. Damn! - Was I right, or was I right? - It cut nearly a second off my time. - Whoo! - My daughter knows how to sell. - Hey, good to see you, Kat. - You too, Mr. Yu. Daddy, why don't you show Marcus the new ski wax we just got in? Great idea. Step into my office. To the naked eye, it would appear Kat Baker's on a date. I think so. Yes. I am. I'm on a date. Let us pray. It's clearly the end of times. Hey, you sure you're okay? Yeah, fine. Uh... I could use a beer, though, and you need a refill. Tell smokeshow we're going to Jimmy's. I'll text him. Yeah, you can wait a hot second. There's a line. This is awkward as fuck. Oh, look. Churros. Okay, bye. Come on. You're really not talking to me right now? You want me to say something to you? Fine. You're an asshole, and I need two beers. - Hey, beer boy. - What the hell is her problem? You'll have to be more specific. How am I supposed to connect with her on the ice when she just shuts herself off all the time? Doesn't look so shut-off to me. Enough of your problems. My turn. I need some pain pills. Seriously, I'm not sure I can lift another ski, never mind finish the competition season. - I'm not that kind of pill guy. - Uh-huh. Look, you don't have to keep skating. You know that, right? Just... tell your dad. I'm sure he'll understand. Whatever. Thanks for trying to help. You know, you're not as much of an asshole as everyone thinks. - Hey, man. - Two beers. What are skaters still doing here? - Yeah, don't we have the ice now? - Car pool's late. - You're Kat's sister, right? - Yeah. All right. Our sister is your brother's partner. No, it's the other way around. Justin is our brother. - That's what I said. - Cool. - You don't really look like Kat. - We have different dads. That's cool. Our mom's dead. - Why would you say that? - Um... Don't say stuff like that! That's my ride. Rides are cool. Hey, we should hang out sometime. Okay. Sure. Tic Tac? Thanks. You know, Serena, I really admire you for putting in all that extra work at the ballet bar today. Mom! I know you wanted to go to that ski thing, but sometimes we need to make sacrifices when we wanna be taken seriously during competition season. Am I right, honey? Thanks for the ride. Oh. Your new haircut looks really cute, by the way. Makes your face look way less puffy. Like, way less. You want another one? Hm... I wish. Early skate tomorrow. Hey, can I ask you a question? Sure. How'd you know it was worth it? Becoming a pair skater instead of going to London. It's a pretty big risk. I guess if you love something, it's worth it. No. That's bullshit. It's not really about love for me. Skating's like... It's like breathing. You know? I don't particularly enjoy it, but I can't imagine not doing it. And if I stopped, it'd feel like... like drowning. Well, that metaphor got dark real fast. I know, but... it's the truth. Hey, man! I heard you skied really well today. And you poured a mean beer, bro. - Can I talk to you? - I'm in the middle of something. That's cool. I can wait. It's okay. It's okay. I'll just meet up with you in a minute. Gotta make a phone call, anyway. Look, just so you know, I'm not an asshole. In fact, someone just told me I wasn't a few minutes ago. Congratulations. Thanks. Because, to be clear, I'm friendly as fuck. And all those girls I slept with, the ones you brought up in acting class, I connected with all of them. They all came back for more, so, uh... If we're not tracking... - it's not me. - Oh, my God! What? This isn't about skating at all, is it? - What are you talking about? - No, this is about your pride. We slept together, and I didn't come back for more. - That is so not it, Kat. - It totally is! Your toxic male ego is out of control. Are you fucking kidding me? This isn't working. It's not fun anymore. - I'm out. - What? What the fuck? I'm gonna... Sorry. Justin Davis! Oh, great! Someone else to come tell me I'm a dick. Did you just... Did you throw that at me? - Maybe. - What the hell? It's, like, made of brass, Mandy! I missed, didn't I? Why are you even here? This isn't your event. My mom started it. It was her event. Do you think I like trudging through the snow, handing out cowbells? I'm here because I love your father. Love is money. It's getting real old letting your bad attitude just roll off my back. But I guess I'm stuck with you. Kat isn't. Heard you called it off with her. It's my business. You know, your dad said that he's finally seen the light in your eyes since you've been skating with Kat. Said he hasn't seen it since your mom died. Feeling a country song coming on here. You can push me away all you want... 'cause I'm not going anywhere. But don't let being afraid to actually feel something again... for Kat, for skating... make you lose both. And you're not a dick, Justin, but you do a damn good job of acting like one sometimes. You look like you could use him. Am I like Mom? What? God, no. You've said it before. Yeah, well, I say a lot of things. You take your meds, right? And you don't, like, sleep with every guy who buys you a plate of chicken wings, so... you've got it together. Mostly. What'd she do this time? She didn't do anything. She was just right... about me. I tried to prove her wrong. To put myself out there and try to open up and let someone in for once, and... it all just bit me in the ass. What happened? I was on a date with Marcus. It was actually... really nice. But then, you know, I thought I had everything under control, and suddenly, Justin just... I think he just broke up our partnership. Why are you laughing? Oh, come on. Can't you see it? This is not a Mom thing. It's a guy thing. Like, two super-hot guys are into you. Boo-hoo! No, Justin's not... Justin's not what? Come on. He's acting like a jealous boyfriend, Kat. I don't know what Justin's deal is. All I know is that... if I don't have a partner, I can't skate anymore. And I need to skate. Really? 'Cause I just want a boyfriend. Will you stay? Just for a little bit. I told Mary-Ann she had a fat face. She probably deserved it. Thanks. Hey, have you seen Kat? Sorry, man. Stepped out to make a phone call, and she just disappeared. Got something I need to tell her. I decided to join the ski team. Whoo! Yeah, you did. Yup. Just turned down Stanford Med School to do it. Wait. What? You turned down Stanford Medical School to ski? My parents would be so proud. Well, hey. If it doesn't work out, you can always go back. Actually, I can't. I was only supposed to take one year off after college. It's been two. They won't let me defer anymore. Damn, bro. That was really stupid. Yeah. But I can't imagine not skiing. - Yeah. - Hope it's worth the risk. Hey, I'm gonna try and find Kat. Or we could celebrate you finally joining the team? Come on. One run. I don't know. Nope, you've never said no to night skiing before. We're doing it. Oh, shit! Jenny! Come. Have some tea. I'm good. I... was hoping I could talk to you guys about something. Oh, uh... Actually, we have something to tell you too. Remember that jumps coach you wanted? And a choreographer? Yeah? Well, they start tomorrow. What do you mean? We hired them last week. They're the best, right? That's what you said. Yeah, but you said they were too expensive, especially with the new franchise. That's the big news, honey. We have decided to hold off on our plan to expand. That's... Wow! You guys. You shouldn't have. I mean, the new store, that's been in the works for so long... Hey. There's time for that down the road. This is your year. Hm? Pa... Ma... We're so proud of you. - Welcome to my humble abode. - I love your abode. Hm! Oh! Ssh! - Serena's sleeping. - Okay! There you go, Katarina. George! Stop. Okay, okay. What? - Okay. - Sorry. I just... I'm sorry. I want to. It's just... I mean, look at you. I just... I just... I can't. Okay. I just... I guess I get into trouble when I move too fast. I'm impulsive... Um... I just need to think about my girls. About Serena. Kat said something the other... Just not tonight. Okay, yeah. No, it's fine. We can be... We can move slowly, - all right? - Thank you. I had a really great time with you today. Me too. Okay. See you tomorrow? Thanks for coming. Why am I here? Because you were right. Sort of. Last year, when we, uh... I called you the next day, and I... I never do that. So when you didn't call me back, I... I was hurt. Not my... Not my pride, just... I don't know. I thought we had a connection. I guess I was wrong, but... that's on me, not you. If that's making it harder for you to skate with me now, I get it. You should know... I wasn't really in a great place back then. If I made things any worse for you, I'm sorry. What I said earlier... I'm sorry too. We couldn't have done this inside? It's fucking freezing! I wanna show you something. My mom used to take me here when I was a kid. I've never actually been out here with anybody else, but... I thought maybe we could just skate. I don't know. It's probably dumb, but... at least your mom's not here.
