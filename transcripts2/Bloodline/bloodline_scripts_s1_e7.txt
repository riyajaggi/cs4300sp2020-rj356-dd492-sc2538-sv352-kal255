 You saw the car hit your brother? Yes, sir. Danny was screaming and crying. I never saw someone get hurt that bad. Mama. So you lied to the police. Yeah. That was 30 years ago. How old were you, 14?

 I think he was all right with it. What? It could have just as easily been me on that boat with Sarah. I'm glad that you guys finally had a chance to talk about this. I feel like things can be better now. Just don't expect too much, you know? People don't change overnight. There's... - Let me get that for you. - Looks scrumptious. - Oh, thank you. - Of course. You've made a real commitment here, Danny. I'm proud of you. I talked to Gwen about a raise. Yeah. Thanks, Mom. This'll be a big help. Oh, shit. Where are we? A boat. - Yours? - No. Not exactly. I'm getting paid shit at the inn. Absolute shit. You know, I gotta make more cash. The old man didn't leave you anything? No. He cut me out of his will. Of course he fucking did. He offered me a chunk of change to leave, though. Why didn't you take it? Because he fucking died before I had a chance. Fuck him. Anyway... I wanna stay here. I wanna fucking get what's mine. Do what I gotta do. But I'm in the hole fucking bad. And this shit? It's just not gonna cut it. This shit's the best I can offer you, pal. Hey. Let me talk to your guy. No fucking way. No. They want us to keep quiet, do our job. - Exactly what we're gonna do. - Eric, there's an opportunity here. - Something at the end of those gas cans. - We got a good thing here. Look at what we got. We got-- It's quiet, it's simple, it's safe. I'm not gonna do anything to fuck that up. All right, thanks, Chase. Bye. Marathon P.D. just called with a heads-up. DA's setting up surveillance in Tom's Harbor. - The marina? - Yep. They think it's narcotics. They promised to keep us in the loop. We'll see. What's that? That trafficking ring that brought in Cristina Colon? Five men were convicted. Five were serving time, Miami federal prison. There's Miami. Pensacola. This one was killed by another inmate in Tallahassee in a labor camp. This is Ray Jenkins. Ray got himself an early release. I imagine you wanna go talk to him, huh? If you're hungry, why don't you grab a donut? I'm not stopping on the way. Some night, huh? - Thanks for the ride. - No problem. I was thinking we could just keep this between us. I could not agree more. Mr. Davis, were you in the bar when the fight began? Yeah. I was coming out the john. How many drinks do you think you had? Objection. Relevance. Mr. Davis claims to have witnessed the altercation. I think it's very important, the state of his sobriety. You can answer. I don't know, probably six or seven beers. What did you see when you came out of the restroom? The Mexican guy grabbed the victim, threw him down and pulled a knife. Mr. Mejia's Cuban. But you're saying that you saw Mr. Mejia draw a weapon. - Clear as day. - Okay. Well, then, I'm just wondering what hand he might have had a knife in. His right hand. And then? Then he said he wanted his money, or he'd cut up the victim. So the victim gave him what he had. Did you see Mr. Mejia use the knife? No, he just grabbed the cash and ran. - And you called the police. - Yeah. Is the victim a friend of yours? No. I just felt bad for the guy. Your phone records from that night show that you made another call as well. - Yeah, I did. - Who'd you call? - The victim's sister. - Oh, did the victim give you her number? No. Then how exactly did you know where to reach her? What the fuck was that all about? Is it really your business? Did you spend the night with that asshole? What do you care? Well, I care, because Captain Fucking Rayburn is the douchiest shit bag in that whole fucking family. You did. Well, that's good. That's good. - What are you gonna tell Danny? - Nothing. Nothing? No, he's not gonna find out, right? I don't care if he finds out. That's my best friend we're talking about, you know? Your friend made it clear that he wants nothing to do with me. So save your fucking lectures for someone else. Why don't you start looking for your own place too? Certainly is a prime piece of waterfront. Yeah. Could more than double my business. You'd have to make improvements on the existing structure. That won't be cheap. Yeah, but see, I thought I could use the loan for that as well, right? And then, I'll use my place as collateral. The bank will need to assess your property and the business before I can give my approval. Sure thing. Take a look around. She's all yours. You know, kick the tires, whatever. I can't do it all today. It's a process. - You're from around here? - Born and raised in Big Pine. I knew it. I knew it. I can tell. A thousand miles away. Conch pride. Listen, this is really important to me. You know? This isn't just a business. It's a local place for local folks, and I'm really trying to keep it that way. I've put my whole life into this place - because I care. - I can see that. Those other guys who wanna buy that property, they don't care. I'll send out the assessor, - and we'll get things rolling. - Fantastic. Thank you. My sister's an attorney. She's gonna help me get my financials all together. Her name's Meg. - Okay. I'll be in touch. - All right. Take care, Debbie. - Bye. - Bye. Monroe County Police Department. Ray Jenkins, open up. Ray, OPEN up now. - The fuck is this about? - Hi, I'm Detective Rayburn. - This is Detective Diaz. - Can we come in? On a beautiful day like today? I think fucking not. Ma'am. You're gonna wanna step back inside, please. - Thank you, ma'am. - Ray. Are you still trafficking girls? Who's running the women these days, Ray? Why don't you listen to WKWT? You get your traffic on the ones. Listen to me, you asshole. I don't know who you fucked over to get out of jail, but I'll end your fucking probation now. Understand? You got a weapon in there? I'll send you back. You got weed in there, I'll fucking send you back. - Do you understand me? - Jesus fuck-- Ray. These girls were killed on their way into the country. Recognize them? - You recognize them? - I'm out of that. My crew's still in prison. I ain't planning on going back. - Anybody recruit you when you got out? - No. Who took over after your ring was busted up'? I'm sure someone did, but they ain't come knock on my door. Don't raise your voice, Ray. Why don't you try a farm? Farm-- You know, this attitude that you got, - it's not helping-- - No, farm. Fucking orchards. You know, fruits and guavas and shit like that. They always need spics over there. Spitz? No offense. That's the least offensive thing about you, Ray. - Most of them hire illegals. - Who's the biggest fucking employer? We brought them to five or six. I asked you who's the biggest one, Ray. Bezler, I guess. Bezler Farms. Bezler Orchards. You ever end up torching one of your own boats? - No. Never. - No? - You sure? - Look, I gave you what you want. We're square, yeah? Yeah, sure, Ray. You're an upstanding citizen, and we appreciate you. Tell his parole officer he's been smoking dope. You're serious? Fuck him. Couple more gigs like this, and I can move out of my fucking sister's place. Here. Yeah. It's a start. Alabama eight-ball. Fifty bucks a pop. You rack, I break. - No, man. Not today, bro. - Come on. - No. Gotta go. - Stick around, would you? I gotta go. You want a beer? A drink? - What is it? - Wine? Sangria? Something? What? What? What? My fucking sister didn't come home last night. Okay. It's not my business. Okay. All right. Great, go. Fucking have a great day. - None of your business. - Okay. Good. So you don't give a shit that Kevin dropped her off, right? Kevin who? Kevin. Your fucking brother. That Kevin. Now, you want me to fucking teach him some fucking respect, you just give me the word, I'll fucking do it. No. No, no, no. Don't-- It's all right. It's not all right. - Their busin-- - It's not all right. They're both adults, man. Don't worry about it. You're a fucking piece of work, dude. This fucking little prick disrespects you, and you're just like, "Oh, yeah." You know what? Kevin can do whatever he wants. I got bigger things to worry about, man. But when your dad decided that he was gonna get your mom... no matter what, he pulled out all the stops. You know, I'm talking about a full-court press. - That's my Mr. Smooth. - Full-court press. And so she had tickets to a concert in Miami. Oh, that's right. Who was that? - Pet Shop Boys. - Yeah. Pet Shop Boys, it was indeed. And your dad decided he had to have a new shirt. He had to have a new shirt for the occasion. He wanted something that looked nicer than what he usually wears. Which wouldn't be hard. I have no idea what these two are talking about. So he had no money, because he spent all his money on his new engine. He wasn't gonna ask our dad for money, so he starts asking me for some shoplifting tips. - No way. What? - No, that never happened. - I never stole a thing in my life. - Oh, I think that's not entirely true. Well, that's kind of romantic, stealing for your woman. - Should've told me. - It didn't happen. I look like a guy who cares about clothes? - Oh, boy. - You sure, son? - You should. - Oh, boy. But you wanted to impress this lady. That much might be true. But anyway. He didn't have to, you know. He didn't have to steal anything, because I stole it for him. How was the concert? I think that's the first night they kissed. I remember that night. Yeah, I remember that shirt. This is all you need, right here. Patch of breeze, a patch of water, a beautiful-- Oh, look. Who does this fucking guy think he is, huh? - Pulling up here-- - Night. Janey. Honey, wait up. You forget your cell. We talked about this. Thanks. You have a good time. Hey, Janey, this guy's a teenager. You gotta keep him off balance. I've got a few tricks. Yeah-- Hey. Don't give him what he wants at the end of the night. - Eleven o'clock. No later. - Got it. Janey. Janey. Janey, come here. Come here. I wanna tell you something. Where the parts go... If you like this guy... Thanks for the tip. Took me 45 years to figure that out. Good night, Mom. Good night, honey. You want me to get rid of this guy? What'd you say to her? Oh, that's between an uncle and his niece. - What? - I said, that's between an uncle and his niece. Every time that kid leaves, it puts a pit in my stomach. She's always gonna come home. I mean, look what she's got to come back to. How the fuck did it not destroy Mom and Dad? Anything ever happened to one of my kids, I don't know what the fuck I'd do. Yeah, you worry too much. You're a cop. You got the safest kids in the whole town. That was nice, right? Yeah, it was. What are you thinking? Nothing. I'm just glad you're happy. The only thing the prosecution has is an unreliable witness who happens to be dating your accuser's sister. All I was trying to do was get my money back from this guy. I know. You know, I-- I know the prosecutor. She's reasonable. I think I can get her to reduce your charges. I'm grateful, Miss Rayburn. Very grateful. Thank you. And what does this mean for my bail? Am I still on the hook? Until your case clears, yes. Unfortunately. - Mrs. Rayburn. - Oh, hey, Carlos. Good to see you. Oh, no. Please, sit down. I hope I'm not a distraction. Especially after Robert's passing. So sorry to hear. Thank you. Meg told me about your case. My mother wants to sign a character affidavit. I think it could really help us. No, Mrs. Rayburn. You don't have to do that. We all make mistakes. Where are you staying? With Manny and his folks. They got me sober. Saved my life. Well, that's what family's for, right? Not all families would do that. - I'm very lucky. - You are. Good to see you, Carlos. Rayburn! You went behind my back. That was some deal you conned my mother into. I'm paying your mother a lot of money. It's nowhere near the amount I secured. Listen, your mom is no dummy. She wants to keep this place pristine. Spare me the sanctimonious bullshit. They were gonna dredge this inlet to make room for those 50-footers. Your mom made a sacrifice. She's doing the right thing. This land is all she's got. Well, I guess she didn't want her legacy to be another fucking yacht club. Or she didn't feel great about putting me out of business. You're a piece of shit, Rayburn. I can't help it if your mom likes me better than you. Fuck you. You better hope you don't get that loan. How you doing, man? - Oh, I'm fine. - Good. How's my sister doing? I really don't know. I mean, she's been really restless lately. But when your dad passed away, all of a sudden, overnight, boom. She wants to get married. Really? I don't understand women. And I sure as hell don't understand my sister. No. No, no, no, I can't. Mom. I'll let you know what I hear. Sure. Thank you very much. Talk to you soon. - Hey, man. How are you doing? Good? - Good morning. - Hey, mister. - Hey, you. How you doing? Good. Yeah, I'm good. - Who was that? - Carlos Mejia. You remember him? - Oh, Manny's, what, brother? - Cousin. Yeah, the drunk. Shut up. That is harsh. - Didn't Dad fire him? - Yes. A few years ago. But he's-- I don't know, he's had it tough, so he's getting sober now. Oh. yeah? Well, good for him. Good for him. Does he work for us now? No. No. He just... He has some legal troubles, so I'm just helping him out. No, I saw Mom handing him an envelope. He put his mom's house up for bail. So we're just pitching in until he gets up on his feet. That's good. That's good. It's good when the family can help other people out. I mean, because, it's why people... They love working for us, right? It's loyalty. - Mr. Bezler? - Good afternoon, gentlemen. Detective Diaz, Detective Rayburn. Beautiful land. You own this place? It's been in the family for generations. Seventy-two, '73? - 1970. First truck I ever owned. - Beautiful. My grandfather had a baby blue '66 C10 with whitewalls. - He called her Camilla. He loved her. - Why don't you take a look inside? - You got more of this? - Oh, yeah. Seventy-five Caprice Classic? 1946 Chevrolet. As knowledgeable as you are, detective, I'm sure you didn't drive out here to discuss the virtues of the automobile. No. We came here to talk to your employees. - I'm afraid that just isn't possible. - Well, why is that? This is private property. If you don't have a warrant, I'm gonna ask you to leave. Sorry. We're not here to investigate your hiring practices. - We can get a search warrant if you want. - Yeah, not a problem. If we do that, might as well invite all the guys here too. Yeah, he plays softball with some guys from INS. Can't hit for shit, but they are sticklers for detail-- Maybe that wouldn't be a good idea. They're gonna seize your books and scour through your employment records. All of my employees provide paperwork. Oh, I'm sure they do. And I'm sure some of it's even legit. John, you know, I envy your guys. They're gonna come here and they're gonna have a fucking field day. Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna let you make the decision. What does that say? "The good neighbor." What does this mean? I think it means someone's trying to help us. No, we'll get it done by 8. Okay, thanks a lot. - Hey. - Hi. - Just came from the bank. - Yeah? How's it look? Property's been assessed. Everything is in order. You have to be sure Belle doesn't file for divorce before that comes through. - Okay. - She could torpedo the whole thing. - Okay. Hey, thanks for doing this. - Yeah. I actually wouldn't advise you going through with it, but you're so determined. It's a lot of money, I know, I know. But, frankly, I don't have another option. I'm barely keeping my head above water here. So you take on debt? Listen, if I get the property, I can expand, you know? L'll-- I'll pay it back. Well, you better. Or they're gonna own the place. I know how it works, Meg. Okay? All right. Hey, did you think about that other thing? Cutting Danny back in? Did you? I just want us all to be on the same page. Well, I don't wanna stand in anybody's way. If it's okay with you guys, it's okay with me. - You're sure? - Yeah. I mean, you know, he's made mistakes, but-- I mean, we've all done things we're not proud of. But listen, maybe it's all for the best. He'll feel included. He won't flake out again. All right. Good. I will draw up all the paperwork. - Thank you. - I'll see you later? - Yeah. Thank you. - Of course. Look at all of this shit. My God, I have not seen the inside of Dad's shed since I was a little kid. The man was very particular about who he let in. - You want something? - Yeah, actually... I've been meaning to talk to you about something... The other night, I kind of hooked up with somebody that I probably shouldn't have. Why are you telling me? It was Chelsea. Yeah, I saw her at this bar. I was out of my mind. She was wasted. It was just so stupid. And one thing led to another. It was... It was a total dickhead move and if you're pissed off, I completely understand. Because it just dawned on me later, maybe that you guys had sort of something going on. - In which case, Danny-- Okay. - Kevin, I said it's fine. I don't think I said anything, but Belle and I are breaking up. - Shit. - Yep. Headed for the big D. Got a lawyer and everything. It's been a-- lt's been a pretty rough time. And now I'm this age and I am single again. It's... It's a horrible feeling. Yeah. Yeah, I bet. It's the worst. So no hard feelings? We're good? - No hard feelings. - Yeah? Okay. Thanks. All right. See you, man. Your sister home? She's at work. Why aren't you dressed, man? We got work to do. The jig is up, dude. It's over. What? Don't shoot the messenger, okay? They're done with us. Word is, the docks are hot. - Which dock? - Tom's Harbor? I don't know. Whatever fucking docks they unload their shit at. Cops have been sniffing around, they wanna shut us down for a while. Hey, you gotta introduce me to these guys. - You gotta let rne talk to them. - I'm not fucking currently suicidal. - No fucking way. - I need the money. - Eric, I need the money. - I know! - I need the money. - I know. I don't know what to tell you, bro. I'm getting the rest of the dough tonight. - When? - I'll get your cut by midnight. Tonight, I'm meeting the guy and I'll get it to you. It's fucking bullshit. - It's bullshit. - Yeah. I gotta go. Excuse me. Excuse me. - I'm sorry. - May I help you? I'm with the sheriff's office. Wondering if you can help. I'm trying to get some information on these girls. They weren't members of my congregation. I was directed to this church, specifically. By who? Well, unfortunately it was an anonymous tip. Hey, look. I'm not trying to look for any trouble here. I'm trying to get information on these girls and that's it. I promise you. Take one more look. - I'm sorry. - lf by any chance... - Could you give me a call? - All right. Thank you for your time. Something else. There was black-- He could've gone like a-- The fuck! Yo! - What the fuck are you doing? - Chill, chill. I wanna talk. - Just wanna talk to whoever's in charge. - Shut the fuck up and sit down. You in charge? Or just an asshole with a gun? You in charge? You just-- Who's in charge? You got a lot of questions. A man can't even take a shit without some stranger walking in. So who the fuck are you? - I work for you. - No, you don't. I run a little bait shop. Sell fishing poles. I only got a few employees, and you ain't one of them. So let's take this again. Who the fuck are you? I deliver gas cans out to the mangroves. Lately, that line of work has dried up and I hear you may be catching some heat. And how is that any of your business? Well, I might be able to help you out. I might be able to solve the problem for you. Hey, look, I'm only trying to help, okay? You wanna ask this guy to lower the gun, and I can talk to you? I guess you really don't know who I am. It's fucking late, you know that? Is it too late for me to apologize to you? I was...such an asshole. Yeah, you were. A really big fucking asshole. And I don't wanna be that. Not to you. Then don't. I know about you and my brother. Yeah, it was fucking stupid, but it happened, so... It's okay. It's okay. It's not like you have a right to tell me who I can be with. No. No, I don't. Sometimes...things happen and you get clear in your mind. You know who you are. You know what you want. And you know what you have to do. So I'm gonna be around for a while. If you decide you can forgive me, I'd love it if you'd call. Wait. Hey. You and your brother... you're the closest thing I got to family. All you have to do is tell me the truth. Let's start with your name. I'm Kevin. Kevin Rayburn. And you were there. You saw the car hit your brother? Yes, sir. Danny was screaming and crying. I never saw someone get hurt that bad.
