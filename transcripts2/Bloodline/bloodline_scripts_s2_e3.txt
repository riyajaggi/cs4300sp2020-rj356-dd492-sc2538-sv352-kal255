Please, don't. You know what? I've seen guys like you before. - You're not a dealer. - Please. - You're just a piece of shit! - Please, God, no! Please, please, please. Hey, kid. What's the word? Here's all the shit you asked for. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - You hear anything? - No. - Anyone talking about me? - No. John? He's not saying anything about your dad's case? Nothing? Bro, they don't talk about it with me. Why the fuck would they? His brother got fucking killed. You'd think he'd give a shit. I don't know what you think I'm gonna find over there, but it ain't gonna happen. All right, just keep your ears open. You want? - Here. - Thanks. Yeah. You got more cash? You spent it all. Mm. All right. You got a pen? - Yeah. - Thanks. Gonna need you to do me something. I need you to be ultra fucking careful, okay? I need you to deliver this. Hello? No, no, that's all right. What? - Honey? - It's nothing, honey. Go back to sleep. Belle, I'm sorry. I haven't found his truck yet. I keep calling his cell, it just goes straight to voicemail. Well, look, he's done this before. I know, but I thought he'd finally get his fucking act together with the baby coming. If he doesn't show up by morning, Diana's gonna come to your house as soon as she gets the kids off, okay? Look, I don't mean to rope you into this. Honey, you're not roping me into anything. That's what family's for. - Okay. - All right. Okay. Shit. Well, it is Kevin we're talking about. Maybe he's sleeping it off somewhere. Did you try the boatyard? I already looked, he's not there. Look, can you check a few places for me? I'm on my way to the airport, I need to get back. All right. All right, you do what you need to do. - I can call some of his friends. - All right, thanks. - Are you worried? - Not yet. Like you said, this is Kevin we're talking about. All right, let me make some calls. - Hey, Jake. - Hey, there he is. Morning, Detective. I'm looking for my brother. I went to the yard, everything's shut down. What's going on? Yeah, Kevin couldn't make payroll, so everybody had to find other work. What the fuck are you talking about? You know me, I'm not trying to start nothing, all right? But ever since Danny passed, Kevin's been scrambling. Having a real hard time keeping the business on track. When's the last time you talked to him? I talked to him yesterday. He called and said that he raised some cash, and he was gonna dole out some... A couple grand to everyone. - Yeah, Marco. - Hey, John. Just got a call. They found a body up near Manatee Bay. Got any details? A white male, 40s. No ID. Okay.

You take this over for a while, will you? Yeah. - Hey, John. - Yeah? You okay? Yeah. Yeah, just keep an eye on things here. Hey. I was just wondering if you were hanging out with Kevin last night. Do you have any idea...? I'm sorry, hold on. What the fuck is going on? - Beautiful day. - Yes, it is. I just wanted to remind you about our bungalow. The shower still isn't working. - You said you'd send someone to fix it. - I'm sorry. - That was bungalow...? - Three. - I'll get maintenance right over there. - Thank you. How was it meeting your new grandson? He's a lot like Danny was at that age. You think it was strange, him showing up out of the blue? Timing and all? I think he wants to know about his father. Maybe it's time for me to be headed back home, Sally. Go, if... If you want. I'll stay. If there's more you want me to do, but... But what? I've worked lots of cases, you get to the end and the answer is not always what you want it to be. What does that mean? Sometimes there isn't any light at the end of the tunnel. Sometimes... all there is is more darkness. And I don't want to see you hurt. I thought I was ready to let this go, but... I saw that boy... that face, and I wonder. Wonder what? What else does my grandson know? You're late, asshole. What happened to your other wheels? That shit was just attracting way too much pussy. - This one smells like dick. - Hey! Watch it, pincushion. This car once belonged to your father. Didn't know he owned a car. Well, there's a lot of shit you don't know about your dad. Hey, hey, hey! I'm over here. Okay, get down! Get on the goddamn floor. Get back, get down. Get down on the floor. On the floor. Face down, hands down. Ma'am, you can stay there. Leave your bag there. Drop your... - You, get up. - No. - Get up. Get up. - No. Please. Get up! Get the fuck up. Stay there. Sit up on the chair. Okay, nothing stupid, people. I have a hostage. Are you gonna be the one that kills her? Is it gonna be you? Good, we're on the same page, so... I... I need the lockbox, I need everything in it, the Oxy... Don't. Everything you got, okay? Every goddamn pill. - Don't tell me you don't have the key. - It's in my pocket. Okay, fucking go. Use it. Go. Go, go, go! - Are you okay? - Get in quick. It's a little... Kind of hard to explain. Have you talked to Belle? She's freaking out. Yeah, well, Belle's not your problem, okay? My marriage is not your problem. - What? - Are you high? - No, I'm not fucking high! - Yes, you are. - I am not! - What are you on? Hey, did you tell anybody I was here? No. What the fuck is going on? - I don't know what to do, Meg. - About what? Oh, God. Oh, God. I don't know what to fucking do. Oh, God. - Shit. - Oh, fuck, - fuck, fuck! - All right, all right. What happened? Thanks, Chase. Bye. Hey, we got a hit on the body. Pete Zakyian, a small-time shithead from Miami. - Deals coke in Liberty City. - What's he doing down here? Looking for new business opportunities? - Maybe he's trying... - What? I gotta take this. Hey, did you find him? You able to bring the thing we talked about? Yeah, I got it right here. Right here. There she is, right there. How long you gonna hide out in this shitbox? As long as it takes for me to get straight with the fuckers who wanna hurt me. What about you? When are you heading back? I'm not. - Really? - Nope. Just think I'm gonna hang out down here a couple days, poke around a little bit. For what? All that shit you told me that went down with Danny at the motel... Well, that sounded very, very interesting. Interesting how? Well, a cop sees somebody coming after his own brother... and then he doesn't do anything about that? I don't know, that... That sounds like some out-there shit to me. Oh. What's that got to do with you? I don't know. I know how to sniff out opportunity. Uh-huh. The question is, how come you didn't take that information to the cops? John Rayburn is the fucking cops. And I've broken my parole a hundred fucking fifty different ways, so... no one's gonna listen to me. Why do you give a shit about any of this? I got my own thing with the Rayburns. I don't know them, I just... I needed some money, all right? So... So, you what? What did...? What did you do? Oh, God! - You have to tell him. - Tell me what? John, I'm so sorry. It was so stupid. - I'm such a fucking asshole. - He made a deal with these guys. What kind of deal? Are you gonna tell him? Do you remember the suitcases that we moved from the inn when we... When we got rid of Danny's stuff? Yeah, I remember, Kevin. I kept some. I'm so sorry, dude. I wasn't thinking. I'm fucked up. I'm sor... - Do you have any idea what you've done? - Yeah. I fucked up. I... I'm sorry. Because of you, whoever you made a deal with, that guy may be dead right now. What the fuck are you talking about? That guy... Those guys tried to kill me, man. - What happened? - They... I'm in my truck. He fucking opened the door, he Tasered the shit out of me, they fucked around with a gun, - then took off. - Anybody know it was you? - I never used my name. - Anybody ID you? - No. - Nobody could ID you? No. It was those two guys. The main guy and then the taller one, and that's it. I swear to God. What about the football player on the yacht? And the football player on the yacht. Just those three. That's it. And a waitress. Fuck. There's a waitress. And then maybe a couple cops. I don't... I don't... I can't remember, man. - Jesus Christ. - Fuck. - God! - He's been using. How long you been using? I don't know. Since Danny. Does anybody else know that you're here? Either of you? - No. - Good. Good. - You stay here. - Okay. - You understand? - Yeah. You're gonna stay here, and you're not gonna make contact with anyone. - All right. - You got that? - Understood? - I understand. Come here. Come here. Come here. It's gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right. - Come here. - I'm fucking scared, man. - I'm fucking scared. - It's gonna be all right. Hey. Hey, John, wait. - What are we supposed to do? - Do you realize what that idiot did? He put Wayne Lowry's drugs back out on the street. One person is already dead. Why is Lowry an issue? He's supposed to be in jail. I'm working on that. I'll tell you what, why don't you just keep him in the goddamn hotel room? That's your job, okay? Thanks for calling me back. Well, I'm always up for a free meal, but I already told you what I know. Ah. Sometimes people forget things. Your dad owed money to some people in Miami. You know anything about that? No, I wasn't around much. When you saw John and Kevin go into your dad's apartment... I'm curious. Do you remember anything else about that? - I've got a question for you. - What's that? If you're so fucking curious, then why not ask John yourself? You remind me of your dad. I knew him, you know, when he was a kid. Younger than you. I always felt like the cards were stacked against him. Are you shitting me? You see that place he grew up? He had a sweet deal. Mother, father, sisters, brothers. One big, happy family. You think you got dealt a bum hand? You found me in a youth shelter. Didn't answer the question. Which one? When you saw your uncle John, your uncle Kevin go into the apartment in Miami, did you tell me everything about that? I've been doing this for a long time, son. What do you want? We need to talk. Why? Your brother is in a shitload of trouble. Well, that's his problem, isn't it? You can act like you don't care about him, but I'm not buying that. What are you doing here, John? I came in, I answered all your questions. Listen. This investigation... It-It's all ongoing. I need to know if you've heard from Eric. I told you I'd call if he contacted me. - Maybe it slipped your mind. - I haven't spoken to him. The people that your brother has been working with, they're bad fucking people. And they are desperate right now. If they find him before I do, I don't know what's gonna happen. But if he comes to me first, I can protect him. Like you protected Danny? You know, you and Eric were Danny's only real friends. If he comes to me... I promise I'll do everything I can to help. These guys... they want Eric dead, don't they? They'll do anything they have to. I don't know where he is, but... someone might. Listen, Belle... Belle, I'm okay. I'm fine. - I'm fine. - Tell me what's going on. I... I... But that's all I can tell you right now. I'm so sorry, and I love you, honey. And I want you to know something. - She hung up on me. - Can you blame her? Meg, how could I know Lowry would find that stuff? No, you shouldn't have been doing it in the first place. I needed the money. No. We all agreed you could use the inn for a loan. I know, but my business is going under. So, you decide to deal drugs? How the fuck does that even happen, Kevin? I thought things would go back to normal. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I'm so fucking tired. Lying to Belle, lying to Mom... You know, I never realized it until you left. You were the one I used to talk to. When I was in trouble... I'd come to you. But now... Okay, so it's my fault? I take a job and your life goes off the rails? - No, I didn't say that. - Why don't you just say nothing? Please. Yeah, just waiting for some of my food to be ready. Thank you. Oh, yeah. Oh, it could be a good thing here. Oh, a real good thing. Come on. Come on, come on, hurry up. Just throw them all in there. - Fucking move... - Honey, I'm home. What the... Oh, man, what the fuck? What are you doing? Just a little one-stop shopping, baby, that's all. All right, everybody. No alarms, no cell phones. You get clever, people, you're gonna get hurt. All right, who's got... Who can open the register for me? - I... I can. - All right, then get up. Get up. - You hear me? - Don't do this, man. Come on. Up, up, up, up, up, up. And no funny business. - You get clever, you're gonna get hurt. - Zip it up, zip it up. We can go now. We got this shit, let's go. Come on, man. I want the whole register. - We gotta go. - Relax. I wanna browse a few more items. Come on, get in! Fuck you. Where are these two dipshits? We've got one of them tucked away. I'm afraid the other one is no longer with us. What'd they have to say? Those two assholes rolled some punk last night, took two keys off him, then tried to sell it to us. The problem is, it was already ours. They were selling product you say was lost. That's impossible. Who did they take it from? Some local. They don't know him, they just fucked him up and left him. So, now it's your job to find him. And how the fuck am I supposed to do that? It's your backyard, amigo. Find him. Or this partnership will be dissolved. This makes no sense. The DEA confiscated our whole load. Then how is the product out on the street? Unless someone skimmed before the DEA got it. I don't like what you're implying. Then do something about it, or I fucking will. I'll find the guy. - Bye, dude. Thank you. - See you. Hey. Why don't you keep your hands up where I can see them, please? Sally? What are you doing? Oh, I was just looking at these hibiscus for the inn. We could certainly use some color. All right. Do you want me to help you with it? What's up? What's on your mind? I need to ask you a few questions, Diana. I'm just trying to understand. It was a lot of... chaos when Danny died. I'm still sorting things out. Yeah. Of course. I mean, I can't even imagine. I know John sent you and the kids away. Did he ever talk about what happened here while you were gone? Just that... I mean, obviously I knew Danny was in some kind of trouble and that John was doing his best to find him. Did he tell you that he went to Danny's apartment in Miami? No? Apparently he went with Kevin. He never told me. I'm sure he had a good reason for not telling us. What's bothering you, Sally? I wanna know what happened to my son. And I don't think John is giving me the whole story. Please know I'm not trying to be insensitive with this, but... Danny threatened our kids. Yeah, I know. That's what John thinks. No, Sally. That happened. You need to know that. I never said it didn't. Da... Danny was way out of control in the end. He was dangerous. So, I... I'm sorry, but I... I just feel like you could have more concern for the rest of your family in all of this. You always disliked Danny. That's not true. I gave him so many chances. We lent him money, he stayed with us. I continued to want the best for him, and he just... He resented me. He disrespected us, Sally. And he disrespected you and Robert, you know he did. Everything in this family has been about Danny for so long. We didn't do right by him. - None of us did. - Sally, those are excuses. Everybody has issues with their family, and not everybody turns into Danny. You don't know what it's like, losing a child. - I hope you never do. - Sally. Please. Please, just... Thank you for the tea. What the fuck we doing here? You arresting me? When that guy came over to your house looking for Danny... what happened? He cold-cocked me, then he kicked the shit out of me. And then you gave up the motel that Danny was staying at. It must have felt real shitty, betraying my brother like that. Yeah, and then when you ran off to save yourself, where did you go? I went to the shithole you found me in. How do you know Nolan? Fuck you, John. Wayne Lowry wants you dead. You know that? If I let him know that you're in town... things would be very bad for you. Come on, John. Is this worth dying for? What? You wanna know the kid... Danny didn't know what the fuck was gonna happen to him so he gave me the kid's number. Okay? Just in case, he wanted me to look out for the kid. That's it. Yeah, I'm gonna give you a very big break. I'll let you make it out of this alive... but you're gonna do absolutely everything I tell you to do. Fuck you. Where we going? Where the fuck are we going? - I gotta get out of here. - You're not going anywhere. I gotta see Belle. I just missed my plane for you. You're not going anywhere. Sit down. God. I'm sorry you missed your plane. You like your new job? - Yeah, I do. - Yeah? It's good to be away, I bet, huh? You have no idea. No, I don't. I'm still here. - Reminders everywhere. - Don't talk about it, please. I'm sorry that I'm not here, okay? You think I don't feel guilty about that? I can't be. In New York, I go to work, I do my job, it's very simple. By the way, no one knows I'm here. Not Mom, no one else, and I'd like to keep it that way. Okay. I understand. I know we used to talk, Kevin, and maybe someday we will again. But right now I just need to take care of myself. Okay. Are you gonna give them what they want? Tell them about Lowry? He killed your best friend. You don't wanna talk to me? Fine. You think I sold you out? Fine. You don't want to consider that maybe, just maybe, I'm worried about you? You know what? Fuck you, Eric. You've never taken responsibility for anything, why start now? Chelsea. There's a lot about this that you don't know. I don't wanna know. I just wanna live my life. - What happened to Danny... - Was Danny's own fault. He made a lot of stupid decisions. I hope you're gonna be smarter than he was. Hey, uh... how's Mom doing? - How's Mom? - Yeah. She's dying. She's on an oxygen tank and a tube in her nose. So, tell me, is she ever gonna see her son alive again? She gonna have to read about you lying dead in a ditch somewhere? He'll do what you want. Thank you. We need to talk. I found Eric O'Bannon. He's willing to give you up. He doesn't know shit. No? He can tie the drugs on you... on those girls that burned on that boat... and maybe even Danny. I already told you I didn't kill your brother. You had something to do with it. - We're done here. - Hey, Wayne. You know, the people that you work for, they gotta be mighty pissed that your drugs are out on the street right now. And Eric O'Bannon going and running his mouth to the feds, that's not gonna make them any happier. I mean, fuck, they're giving you an awful lot of rope, aren't they? And eventually they're gonna hang you with it. What do you want? I wanna be your lifeline. So, now you're gonna make me an offer. How nice. What's on the table, Detective? - Twenty-five years. - Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me. You give names, you keep your nose clean... you will be out in ten. I give them up, I'm dead. Even in prison. It's a federal case. The government, they take care of their assets. They'll take care of your wife and they will take care of your son. And in exchange for this generous offer, you want your brother's tape. I'll think about it. Come on. - Come on, man, let's fucking go. - Didn't I ask you not to? So, why'd you press it? Why? Why the fuck did you press the alarm? Why'd you press the fucking alarm? I was afraid you were gonna kill somebody. Come on. What's wrong with you, you fucking...? Oh, Jesus. Oh, shit. How you doing? These assholes treating you okay? Yeah, Mom. The Rayburns are treating me just fine. - You leave the front door open? - Hey, baby. Did you leave the front door open? No. Chris! You leave the front door open? You hear me? - Who left the front door open? - Not me. What the hell did I tell you about leaving doors open? Wayne, he said he didn't. You come in, you lock the goddamn door. Wayne, what is wrong with you? What? Let me call you back. - What's up? - I just got a call, Lowry's lawyer. He knew we had O'Bannon in custody. - Yeah? - Lowry wants to propose a deal. Why the hell would he wanna turn himself in now, huh? My guess, he's shitting his pants. Product's out on the street, higher-ups can't be real happy about that. Yeah, well, I bet you could guess how we'd feel about making a deal. He could get us the network. We could take down half the Eastern seaboard. What is the deal? Lawyer offered up a 25-year bit. Yeah, what's he gonna serve? Ten, 15 max? Look, even with O'Bannon, our case is thin. Most of his testimony is hearsay. This is a huge break for us. No, this is a huge break for you. John lost a brother. Is Lowry copping to the murder? No. Lawyer says we don't have enough for that. And he's right, we don't. - So, why are we having this conversation? - Say, what if we... We take this deal, Danny's case goes cold. No one will pursue it. But the guy who did this will be behind bars. And, John... that might be the best we get. I don't like it. But my family's been through enough. I'll agree to this deal... but only if you can give me your word that you'll bring down that network. Because if you don't, this is all a waste. We'll get them. Thanks, John. John. Why the fuck haven't we heard from John? Hey, maybe I can fix things with Lowry. - What are you talking about? - I think I can get us out from under... - No. No. - Meg. Listen to me. John has done nothing, all right? Lowry is supposed to be in jail. He's not. We're not supposed to be dealing with Danny anymore. I need you to look at me, okay? I need you to look at me right now. You are in no condition to be offering solutions. You need to stay here and focus on not making anything worse. Is that him? - Is it John? - Shit. - What? - Hi. - Who is it? - It's work. You were supposed to be back today. I'm so sorry. I meant to call you. We just had a family emergency. Meg, you missed the meeting. Uh... Yeah. Yeah, I know, the Pell case. I've been going over those depositions. This family thing has been so tricky and I... It caught me by surprise. Okay, well, I really needed you here today. I was counting on you. If I just could have one or two more days just to be able to sort things out here. Okay, I don't understand. Do you even want this job? Yes, I absolutely want the job. I 100 percent want the job. I just... I promise you I will be there, I just need... I have to call you back. Kevin! Kevin? Hey! Kevin, hey! Fuck! Fuck. Hey, Mom? Mom? Hey, John, I'm sorry to take you away from your family. What the hell is going on? Diana told me you and her had words. Yeah. Got a little heated. Is everything all right? When Danny first went missing, I asked Lenny Potts to look for him. And... he discovered some things. Things I found disturbing. Danny told us that he was moving drugs through the inn, and I know the DEA searched the property... but didn't find anything. And the day before the pier dedication, you and Kevin went to Miami... to Danny's apartment. And you were carrying suitcases. Is that true? Oh, God, John. Why didn't you tell the police about any of this? I... Listen to me. Let's say, hypothetically, Mom... before the DEA... came to the inn to search for those drugs and arrest Danny... before that happened... I took them. Let's just say, hypothetically, the people that were looking for Danny, Mom... and the near two million dollars in drugs that he stole from these people... they were getting very, very close to finding him. Can you think of any good reason why I might take them to Danny's apartment? So... you were... giving the drugs back to Danny so he could return them. That's one possibility, hypothetically. You risked your career... to protect your brother. You always looked out for your brother... even to the end. I love you, Mama. ♪ Yeah, I'm a liar ♪ ♪ I'll rip your mind out ♪ ♪ I'll burn your soul ♪ ♪ I'll turn you into me ♪ ♪ I'll turn you into me ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm a liar, a liar ♪ ♪ Liar, liar, liar, liar ♪ ♪ Sucker ♪ ♪ Sucker ♪ ♪ Oh, sucker ♪ ♪ I am a liar ♪ ♪ Yeah, I am a liar ♪ ♪ Yeah, I like it ♪ ♪ I feel good ♪ ♪ Oh, I am a liar ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ I'll lie again and again ♪ ♪ And I'll keep lying ♪ ♪ I promise ♪
