 No! Second shot into 18. Ball above his feet. Long way into the green. A 4-iron... Hello? Oh, my. I am so sorry to hear that. It's somebody from your old fleet. What do they want? Robert Rayburn is dead. How long? Two days, I imagine. Where are you gonna stay? Not with them.

 No, not with them. Maybe you should tell them you're coming. Well, maybe better if I don't. Another perfect night in paradise. Yes, it is. Your son took us out on the reef this afternoon. I've never seen anything like it. Isn't it beautiful out there? So much life going on under the waves. It's all around us all the time, but we so rarely get to see it. - We appreciate you having us. - I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. We're happy to have you celebrating your honeymoon. Exciting to be back. I have a flight out of Miami tomorrow morning.

 I need to cancel it. ls there some kind of bullshit penalty I have to pay? - If anyone's hungry. - Thanks. Thank you. What is she doing? She's just sitting out there. Do you have to do that right now? It's for Mom. The last time I saw him, I just talked about business. We were driving in his truck. God, he was happy. He was the happiest I've ever seen him. Wait, where'd you guys go once you dropped us off? Just went for a drink, had a talk. About what? Oh, he... wanted me to take on more responsibilities at the inn. Hey, the moon's out tonight. Mom, sit down. Thanks, Meggie. Mom, a lot of people have been calling. You know, they're asking about a memorial service. We don't have to talk about it now, but if you have any ideas... He told me he didn't want a service. Really? When? Oh, I don't know. Somewhere along the way. Years ago. He said he didn't want to be buried in the ground, and he didn't want people fussing over him. That sounds like Dad. Mom, we're gonna have to do something. People are gonna wanna pay their respects. Yeah, I know. - Thank you. - Here you go. I'm glad you two had some time together. - Good night. - Good night. John? I don't want a lot of people giving speeches at the service. Everyone thinks they have something to say, and it just goes on and on. All right. I want you to speak for all of us. Traffic today in the upper Keys there at the Overseas Highway. Oh, fuck. If you're going that way, expect some slowing. It's about a mile beyond the wildlife refuge. Also some slowing on the 1 there, between Rock Harbor and the Key Largo Chamber of Commerce. - Roadwork is being done... - Oh, man. Hey, how's my favorite newlyweds? - How you guys doing today? Got plans? - Yeah. Driving down to Key West. Haven't seen it yet. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time, though, okay? Because it always takes longer than you think. We heard about your father. I'm so sorry. - Yeah, thank you. - We feel so foolish. We talked with your mother last night, didn't know about it. - Please, give her our condolences. - Yeah, I will. Well, you know, he had a massive stroke, and then he got a clean bill of health, and then, boom, he just dropped dead. Well, if there's anything we can do... All you guys gotta do, enjoy yourselves. Because that's what Dad would have wanted. Yeah. Make sure you leave plenty of time. Plenty of time. Always takes longer than you think. I thought I'd set up a table and put some of these out for the reception. I love that idea. I just don't know which ones to choose. This one. - Yeah. - Definitely this one. Sorry- I wanna put this one out. What do you think? I don't know. I think she should be there for him in some way. I didn't even know you had all of these. They had a special bond. Yeah, I remember. Fuck. So, what does this mean for you? Dad's dead? I mean for your plans. Doesn't mean anything. Nothing. So you gonna stick around? I am, yeah. Cool. Hey, excuse me. These are-- I asked for over easy. - They look easy enough to me. - No, no, no. Those-- That's hard there. And that's hard there. Over easy, please. You want some of mine? - Just a bit. - Stop it. What time's the service tomorrow? - Hey, fuck this. Let's go. - I just started. No, come on. They can't even cook a fucking egg. Fuck these guys. Honey, I gotta go down to the nursery - and do the flowers-- - Okay. - You need anything? - Nope, I'm good. Thanks. How's it coming along? I don't know what the fuck I'm writing. Please, don't say I should write whatever I feel. Okay. I won't. It's not like he can hear me anyway. Who knows? Maybe he can. Thanks. Oh, jeez. - Did you put gas in the car? - Here we go. - No, I did not. - Great. - Hey, Di. - Hey. You need anything? I'm going into town. Oh, no. I'm good. I'm good. - Hey. - Hey, I brought your bike back. What's this, your eulogy? - What? What? - "Like a whole library burned down"? - What the fuck's that supposed to mean? - The man had a lot of stories. - It's just a thought I had. It's stupid. - Yeah. It's stupid. I mean, a library burning down. See... No. - What? - Nothing. So do you think I should say something? What do you mean? Say something at the service? Yeah, I mean at the service. I mean, just, it seems kind of strange... that I wouldn't say anything. I don't think it's strange. So you don't think I should say anything? I don't think you should say anything if you don't wanna say anything, no. I think I'll say something. - Good. Go ahead and say something. - Yeah. Wish I could help you write this, but, you know... Fuck, he treated us so different, right? It'd be like we were talking about two different people. Hey, you remember Lenny Potts? Dad's friend? Yeah. I think I just saw him in town. Really? Jesus Christ, I hadn't thought about him in... a long time. - Must be here for the service. - Well, I can't be sure it was him. Hey, you know what? You're trying too hard. This-- You should just wing it. Mom? And how old are you, John? Fourteen. Thought I heard you down here. Oh, you found your father's secret stash. You know it was never really much of a secret. Pour me a glass. Danny wants to say something at the service tomorrow. We've already discussed this. Mom. I won't tell my siblings that they can't speak at their own father's funeral. I'm sorry. Well, what is it? You afraid of something he's gonna say, or what? I don't know. I just... I just don't think your father would want Danny to speak. Well, Dad's not here, and Danny is. I don't even know what the hell I'm gonna say. Well, it doesn't have to be perfect. Well, it would be nice to be able to say something about him that people don't already know. He always said his childhood was shit. He never talked about his childhood. Well, what you don't know, he didn't want you to know. He didn't like people feeling sorry for him. How bad was it? Come on. He must've told you stories over the years. A few. He grew up on a cattle ranch. - I knew that. - It was supposed to be a cattle ranch, but his grandfather was a shit businessman. He was a shit everything. Do you know your father never finished high school? He told me. - Do you know why? - Because he was a shitty student. Yeah, he was too busy getting into trouble back then. But that's not why he didn't graduate. Why didn't he graduate? You remember Gram? Bits and pieces, yeah. - She wasn't his real mother. - No, she was his stepmother. He liked her better than he liked his father, which wasn't necessarily saying much. But one day, I don't know, it might have been Memorial Day weekend. I know there was some kind of a barbecue. Anyway, your father was off somewhere, and when he came back, he couldn't find his stepmother. What do you mean, he couldn't find her? Where was she? - Why do you wanna hear this? - Mom, tell the damn story. Come on. So he couldn't find her. He didn't think much of it at first. Then he went out in the backyard and your grandfather was standing at the grill flipping steaks, and they were all burnt. Black and charred. But he just kept sticking them with that grilling fork and flipping them over and over again. He must've been drunk. Anyway, that's when Robert knew that something wasn't right, and he went back in the house, and he asked your Uncle Tuck and Aunt Lynn if they knew where she was. And they were just little kids then, and they were too scared to say anything. Scared? Why? Well, he didn't know why. But then I guess he heard some kind of... moaning and crying... and he realized it was coming from the cellar. - The cellar. - Your grandfather locked her down there. Your father let her out and saw that her face was all... Well, what? Smashed up. Her face was all smashed up. Blood, broken nose. So, what did he do? Did he call the police or...? No, it was rural Texas, late '50s. And they wouldn't have done anything. So he went back outside to confront your grandfather, and they fought. They went at it. And what happened? Your grandfather cut him with a steak knife. And your father... he snapped. And he grabbed the grilling fork, and he stuck it in your grandfather's throat. He said he almost killed him right there... but somehow he stopped himself. He told me... he had two little holes in his throat, like he'd been bit by a rattlesnake. He used to laugh about that. Found it funny somehow. Then he backed off and... He left, and I don't think he ever came back home again. He told me once that... if he didn't get out of there, he would have killed the son of a bitch. That's why he never finished high school. - Yeah. - The wreath. - Where's Belle? - She's not coming. - Are you serious? - I didn't want her here. It was my decision. - Hey. - Sucks, bro. Is that all you can say? He just lost his dad. Don't worry about it. It's okay. But you guys didn't have to come. Come on. You kidding? When something's lost, something else is gained. I know it sounds like bullshit, but I believe it. Yeah. Thanks, Chel. Thank you. - What are you gonna tell people? - I'll say she was too upset. I don't know. I'll say something. I don't know. Hey, Belle. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Thanks. My father didn't talk much about himself. He told stories. Yeah, about being in the Navy... about the Keys... what it was like before the tourism boom. He told a lot of stories. But he didn't talk much about himself. And if you think about that, it-- It says a lot about him. Christ, this is a lot of pages. My brother Danny told me that I should wing this. And at the time, I thought it was a bad idea. What the hell. Look... to me my dad was a... He was a god. Maybe every kid is... Feels that way about his dad. But mine... He actually created a world. This. This. Every-- Everything around here... he created... out of nothing. Because when he was 17 years old and he left home... because all he had...was nothing. People ask me... All the time, they ask me if I'm gonna take over the family business. And I think to myself... you know, what would that be like? To live like Dad? Walk onto that porch and look over my...kingdom. But I will never know that feeling or that pride... because I didn't build it. He... He ruled his kingdom. He could be tough. He could be hard. He had a vision for the family, and he knew exactly what he wanted us to be. If you didn't-- lf you didn't toe that line, or you didn't live up to that vision, you... And how old are you, John? Fourteen. Well, you know, he... Dad expected the best from us. Because he wanted the best for us. Everything that-- Everything that I have, everything that we all have is because of him. He made me who I am. And now my brother Danny, he'd like to say a few-- Well, I know how he feels. I know how we all feel. And we'd like to thank all of you, everyone... for coming out and paying your respects... to our father. - Excuse me a second. - Go ahead. Thank you both so much for coming. We really appreciate it. How's your mother? I asked you not to come here. - This is what I'm talking about. - Here we fucking-- Right here. You see what you're doing? No, tell me. What'd I do wrong now, huh? You were the one who left me. We should be out there with your-- What am I doing? We should be outside with your family right now. And instead you drag me in here to throw a fit. - You're acting like a child. - I'm behaving like myself. This is me. This is the man you married. Not Marco. Not John. Not your father. What? - I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. - What? What did you say to me? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. Get out. - Just-- I mean it. Just get out. - Kevin, I'm sorry. - I need to say goodbye to your family. - Get out. Get the fuck out of my family's house. - How's your mother? - She's not so great. She's got tubes coming out of her nose, wheeling a tank like a poodle on a leash. - I'm sorry. - She would've liked to have been here. Wouldn't have been fair to you. She'd be hammered by now, so... It's a disease. You okay? I know that wasn't easy for you. I was just a little distracted is all. - You did amazing. - Thanks. There he is. Bobby's boy. Detective Potts. - This is my wife, Diana. - Nice to meet you. Just like your father. He always got the pretty one. Back in the Navy, me and Bobby, we'd pull into port, head into town. Five minutes later, he would be surrounded. You could not see him through a fog of skirts. I can see that. I appreciate you coming. I'm truly sorry for your loss. - Both of you. - Thank you. Detective Potts was with the Sheriff's Department for, what...? I left in '87, and I understand you found a badge. - Yes, sir. I did. - Hey. Maybe Detective Potts can help you with your case. I'm sure Detective Potts has more to do than worry about what I'm up to. You'd be doing me a favor, please. He needs to talk to someone. Well, I don't know why you'd wanna pick through this old brain, but buy me a drink, I'm happy to listen. Well, sure, that'd be great. I'd appreciate it. Thank you. Hey, are you okay? I'm sorry. Just sad about Robert. Listen to me, telling you I'm sad. - He was your father. - No, it's okay. Do you need anything? I just think I need to go home. I'm sorry. - You're okay? - Yes, thank you, Marco. Take care of my girl. Hey, come over here. Hey, Meg, is everything okay? - You need to stop. - I heard about your father. I've been trying to reach you. I told you I cannot talk to you right now. I just wanna make sure you're okay. What the fuck is wrong with you? I'm at my father's funeral. I didn't know that. I'm sorry, Meg. You know what? Don't call me ever again. Danny. I don't know if you remember me. - Yeah. - Been a while. I had forgotten how clear this water is. Yeah, it's something. Whole place, one big coral reef. That's right. Well, hey, I'll let you have your peace. Wanted to let you know how sorry I was about your father. That's all. You think they have something going on? Now there's a perfect couple. What happened with you and Belle? Oh, ours. - What, should I leave or--? - No, just tell him. - What? Tell me what? - Tell him. - He already knows. - What? Well, about you and Belle. I know. What the fuck? I told you not to tell anybody. - He's my guy. He doesn't count. - Fuck it. I don't care. I honestly-- I don't give a shit who knows. I don't. Fuck it, because I'm free. Did you guys fight? I've never seen her like that. All this time, I thought it was me. What I wasn't doing for her. It was all my fault. But what I realized is that it's not me. It's her. It's what she wants, you know? It's what she needs. Fuck it. I'm free. I know you're free, - but you sure you want another one? - I'm free. So this case... Yeah. Hispanic girl, 14, 15 years old, no ID, burns over most of her body, washed up in the Mangrove. A few days later, we found a charred hull. Diesel fuel on the boat matches up to the fuel on the girl. Teenage girl wouldn't be alone on a pleasure cruise. - Find any other bodies? - One, but there have to be others. We did a search, and also checked all the hospitals in the Keys up to Miami. Years ago, we had a case. Mother reports her son missing off Key Largo. A few weeks later, found a body 50 miles north. - Got caught in the Gulf Loop. - Looks like it. Had a study commissioned on the current patterns. Report should be in the archives somewhere. Be sure to check into that. You never know. You miss working? I do a little Pl stuff part-time. Keeps me busy. You know, I think I... I became a policeman because of you. - You're blowing smoke. - No, no, no, my... You know, my dad talked about you a lot. He made you out to be like John Wayne or something. I don't know if you remember, but you took Danny and I to the gun range one time. We thought you were-- We thought you were a badass. That's what we called you, Mr. Badass. - No, I told you no. - Giving him an opportunity. - I told you already. - It's opportunities, man. - Hello, my brother. - Hey. - Oh, boy. - I'm free. - You are? Congratulations. - That's right. Thank you. - Congratulations. - What's he talking about? I got no fucking idea what he's talking about. Listen. You don't need to worry what I'm talking about, okay? The only thing that you need to worry about is that I'm free. - Fucking free. - You're free? Congratu-fucking-lations. You're free and a drunken fucking idiot. And I'm free to be a drunken fucking idiot. Hey. you got any blow? - Really? Now? - No, man. Fucking cut him a break. - Cut him a break. - Fuck him. His dad died. He's just-- You know. And he's a drunken fucking idiot. That's right. My fucking dad just died. Why didn't you speak at the funeral? What? John did such a sterling job. - How could I follow that? - You don't fucking believe that. - You're full of shit. - It was beautiful. You are so full of shit. That was disgusting. That was horrible, man. My father would've fucking hated it. It would've killed him. Hey, I danced with you one time. No! - I don't think so. - No, no. We did. We totally did. Frog Baylor's house party... You remember that douche bag? Early '90s... What was that fucking song? - I don't remember. - Was your hair pink? - It was. - It was pink. It was a lovely shade of fuchsia, as I remember. Fuck it. Danny's friends were always the most fun anyway, right? - Can we get a drink please? - I'm tired. I'm gonna go home. - No. - Okay, no, I gotta go. - Come here. Come here. - No, I'm tired, brother. Tired. - My brother. - Oh, man. Fucking hell. Come on... - Take care. - I will. - Sorry about your dad. - Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. We should have that dance again. As soon as we can. Hey, dude, are they fucking together? That is not my business. Nor is it yours. You want some blow, really? No, I don't want any fucking blow. - Shut up. - What the fuck are you talking about? - What's that have to do--? - Prick. - What the fuck? - Fuck off. Fuck you. What happened with you and my father? We had a disagreement. It happened about the time that you lost your sister. I don't know how much you remember about all that. I try not to think about it too much. And for Bobby. You lose a child, it does something to a man. It was tough. We worked our way through it. Well, I'm glad to hear that. And then your brother was injured. How's Danny been doing all these years? - He's been good. - Well... What's he doing? Danny? He... Well, to tell the truth, Danny struggled a bit. Life's... Life's been kind of hard on Danny. I'm sorry to hear that. It's nice to see you're doing well. Thanks for the beer. I should be going. Yeah. Please, be home. Come on, baby. Come on. Oh, yes. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I... I'm-- I don't know what I said. I don't know why I said that to you. Hey. You can stay, you know. Yeah, that's not what this thing is. - What thing? - You and me. Look, I didn't say it was anything. I just said you could stay. Thanks, Cece. Night. - Denise, how you doing? - Hey, I haven't seen you in a while. - It's been a while. - Yeah. Got an old case to check on, if that's all right. - Of course. - Thank you. Morning. I'm headed back north. I just wanted to say goodbye. - Okay. Mom is in the house. - I wanted to talk to you, I-- - I gotta go to work. - It'll just take a second. What is it? - I just wanna say I'm sorry. - For what? Well, for not doing my job better, I guess. I know what happened to you, Danny. I know how you got hurt. I knew it at the time, but I couldn't prove it. I wanted to tell you how sorry I was about your father... and that's all. You know what? Thirty years ago. Who gives a damn? Your father was my good friend, but he had a mean streak. What happened to your sister was an accident, but your father, he took it out on you. I did what I could at the time, tried to talk to your family about it. But I should have done more. What do you mean you tried talking to my family? They never told you? Well, there's something you need to hear. Date is November 11th, 1983. This is Detective Leonard Potts interviewing John Rayburn. Can you say your name for the record? John Rayburn. And how old are you, John? Fourteen. And were you there when your brother got hurt? Yes, sir. And what happened? He was hit by a car. - And was your father there? - No, sir. He was at the hospital with my sister. - You telling me the truth, son? - Yes, sir. Are you sure you're telling me the truth? Yes, sir.
