 my 1,500 hours of apprenticeship so I can be certified here in Oregon. I'll grab my pants, and let's go. Friend of mine was killed some years back. His widow. I help her when I can. I put Wallace Kane away, you know. I know him. Well. Killed one of my C.I.s a few years back. If I was under his thumb, I'd be afraid. I can pay. I just need time. But Kane's in jail for life,

 and I'm not going anywhere, you know? My life is here. $500,000. That's insane. That is what you owe. Candace is in the middle of a nasty divorce battle with Randall Tapper. My final custody hearing is next week, and the deck is completely stacked against me. We can help. If you were to dig up dirt on Randall, where would you start? I'll handle it from here. You sold the tape to Tapper? Yep. She is gonna lose her kid. Artie sold me out, and...Randall's gonna pay,

 and Artie's gonna pay for what he did. And I... ...I won't lose again. Whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Unh-unh! No, no, no, no, no! Not my all-time favorite booty call! Oh, but it is damn satisfying. I am unfazeable, Doll. That's not a word. Ohh! I can't believe you're working for Tapper. First rule of king crabbing  don't stop when the fishing's hot. I'm the fisherman, and Tapper's an ocean floor of crabs. You know, I'm curious. Have you always been a soulless leech, or did you just grow into it? You are mad. I get it. I'd be mad, too. Don't hate the player. Tapper's gonna pay. Not as long as he continues to employ me as your shadow, babe. So, I guess it's war. No! Ah, damn it! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a serious situation on our hands. A few hours ago, there was a two-vehicle collision on I-84, just outside of Baker City. A lone SUV driver collided head-on with an Oregon Department of Corrections transport vehicle. When the State Police arrived, they found two correctional officers dead from the crash... Please! Please! Please! ...and one... Please! Please! ...dead from two gunshots to the head. The Corrections vehicle was transporting an inmate from Sheridan to USP Thompson. That inmate is Wallace Kane. I need a whiskey... and a good chiropractor. I'd say it's time we move, brother. When the authorities arrived, the driver of the SUV was nowhere to be found, and Kane was missing from the bus. As you all know, Detective Hoffman sent Kane up after he killed one of our informants. He is considered to be armed and very dangerous and was last seen in Washington state. So this is a fugitive case moving forward, and that is why the United States Marshals are here. We are to assist them in their manhunt. Nothing more. If you see something, if you hear something, you tell these folks. Understood? Yes. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Here. Oh! Uh, no, I don't think that I should be  Mila can't sleep unless she's in my arms, so I haven't had a free hand in a week. Oh. Okay. I'll just... Hello. It's okay. What's okay? If you're here to tell me that you're giving up. I've heard it from just about everybody that has offered to help. I'm not giving up. I appreciate your passion, but Randall has the entire town in his pocket. Yeah, I just  I-I need a lead to point me in the right direction. I-Is Randall involved in any kind of illegal activity? Uh, I don't  I don't know. I-It's the only way you'll keep custody of Mila. He built a children's hospital a couple years ago on a different reservation  St. Aaron's. I overheard him talking about it, and it sounded a little shady. Okay. So, there's got to be records of that somewhere. Well, if you're gonna find records, they'd be in the West Linn office, but that place is a fortress. I'm scared. It's normal to be a little scared. No, man, I'm scared a lot. Darius, shake that off, man. Okay? You got to shake that off. Kane can smell it if something is up with you, man. I think he knows. That I'm working with you guys. Why would you say that? 'Cause I know him. I can feel it. No. No, nothing has come across the wire like that. We would have heard something if Kane was suspicious. Yeah? Yeah. I promise you. Now, look, you came for my help. I gave it to you. Alright? I sold this to my bosses. I got 10 cops and 2,000 man-hours devoted to this thing already. We got you covered. If anything even looks like it's gonna go sideways, we're moving in. Alright? Come on. Let's go. Look, maybe we do this tomorrow, man, you know? When my  When my nerves settle a bit. Darius, we got to go. Come on. Let's go. We got to go now. Trust me. Come on. I got you. Hey. You hungry? I can make you a little something. I just put on some coffee. Maybe we should...sit. Alright? Kane is out. He escaped from a prison transport last night. I'm sorry. Denise, say something, please. If I tell you that I'm pissed or that I'm scared or that I'm angry, you get to deliver some speech about how you're not gonna go to sleep every night until you have my husband's killer behind bars again. You need me to be scared, Miles, because you need to be the hero. This is  No, no, no. Stop! Stop. Look, you were right. I need to move on. And that's  that's what I'm doing. I hope you guys get Kane, but Darius is dead, and there's nothing that can change that. Just let it go, Miles. Don't you think it's a little over the top, trashing Artie's car? Eh, he had it coming. I know what it feels like to be abandoned. I don't want Candace or her baby to ever have to go through that. Well, you got a plan? Yeah, I got a plan. 'Cause this Tapper guy's gonna come after you with all his ammo. I got a plan. It's airtight. Who's got two thumbs and is ready to spy? I think you and I have different definitions of "airtight." What are you wearing? Feel good, look good. Okay, well, I appreciate, uh, the effort, but, um... you're gonna have to change into this, okay? You want me to go undercover as a janitor? Don't you think that's racially sensitive? "Insensitive." Whatever. It's not a good look. But it's the right look. I mean, you're gonna have to blend in so you can break into Tapper's office and steal the St. Aaron's files. Remember? My mother worked her entire life so I didn't have to be a janitor. You're not actually gonna be a janitor. I thought you said this Tapper dude was a rich business type. I look the part, Dex. Mm-hmm. Why don't we play against type? Let me roll in there "Shark Tank" style, pretend I want to build something. Okay. Go. Like what? Buildings? Airtight. Okay, look, I think you know that this is just not gonna work, so how about you pretend you're a janitor who is gonna own the whole damn building one day? I can do that. Amigo, someone did a serious number in the men's head. Massive cleanup. Comprende? Okay? Cool. Come on. Come on, baby. Come on. I'm so good. Hey! Hang on a minute. Hey, buddy, I said  Hey! Stop right there! I said "Stop"! Hey! Get back here! Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. Seriously. What are you doing? Sorry. Yeah! Hey. You can get arrested for Dex's suicide mission or you can hand over that file and be on your jolly way. Clock's ticking, brother. Vamanos. Tell Dex she's gonna pay for my Mustang. Bad news. I got the goods, then Artie halted my escape. I had to hand over the documents. Now ask me what's in my pants. I took the duplicate files and the originals, knowing if I got caught with originals, they would never suspect I also took the duplicates. Jason...Bourne. Well, these numbers must mean something. Aren't you an entrepreneur? A taco costs 78 cents to make. I charge $4. That's the level of accounting I can handle. What do you want? Interesting move, sending Rico Suave in. You're not funny. The crowd at Gentry's Books' open-mic Sundays would beg to differ. Listen, Dex, you got me, okay? I can admit when someone makes a nice move. I know that your guy swiped duplicates of the documents. I slipped. I played down to the competition. How much longer is this gonna go on? Let me spare you the trouble. You got nothing. But you're a nuisance, and you get more flies with honey, so Tapper wants a sit-down. How do you feel about napping with the enemy? You're a little too deeply involved in a personal matter that has nothing to do with you. I don't know what lies Candace is telling you. Lies? Didn't I see a video of you attacking a woman in an elevator? You don't know what it's like to build something like I've built... Mm-hmm. ...and have someone you brought along for the ride try and take it from you. I want to laugh. Can I laugh? Because... You can't pay me off. It's for Candace. It's a fair offer, but it's final. And Mila? She's my daughter. Candace can't give her what I can give her. You didn't even want her to keep the baby. Take it or leave  Leave it. Yeah. I'm leaving. Ms. Parios, you can't know what it is to be me. Mm. Candace with her past, she can't be the mother of my child. That's not how my world works. No, I think I get it. It's not enough for you to win. When someone crosses you, you have to destroy them. Sounds like you know what you're up against. Sure do. The answers are in here somewhere. Tapper wouldn't offer a settlement unless we were holding something incriminating. Look, the reason you can't understand this deal is 'cause it's not meant to be understood. These costs are way off. It says "concrete for the hospital," right? Mm-hmm. It says it costs $7.4 million. That's way too high. That is way too low. Low. Low. That's what I meant. So, look, you find the person who conjured up this trash, and you're gonna get all your answers. Looks like we're on the right track. I'd offer you a beer, but you wouldn't drink it. Tapper's threatening to pull out of the school project. And that's my fault? Tapper's a brand. A school like that goes up on the reservation with his name attached, politicians get involved, media  amplifies our voice. Mm. So it's about image. It's about justice. It's funny. We're both after the same thing. Yet... one of us has to lose. You still owe the casino $11,000. You cleared that debt. Did I? Unpaid markers are Class D felonies with jail time of about four years in state penitentiary. The world is gray, Dex. Are we done here? You have 10 days. Or back off Tapper. Ansel. It's been a long time. Do you remember me? You're Benny's mom. I was in on this long before you guys got here. And we have people following it up. Who? People. Your people lost him once. Let me find him. Hey. Is there a problem? Lieutenant, Feeney was in prison with Grey McConnell. Guess who else was on his tier. Wallace Kane. Feeney ends up dead. A week later, Kane breaks out. Somehow, these very fine federal officers don't see the connection. We've taken your specious evidence under consideration. You know what, man? You could be just a tad less condescending. Yeah. I could be way more, too. Okay. I'm sorry. You see that office over there? It's big. That's because I'm in charge. And you, sir, are our guest in need of our assistance, so please act like it. What the hell is going on? Look, I'm sorry. Darius was my friend. He was an informant. He knew the risk. And now he's dead. I'm giving the Feeney murder to Kent. Kent sucks! No disrespect. Oh, I think he would find that pretty disrespectful. That's not what's best for the case. But it's what's best for you. Hey! That's my car! Hey! What's up?! Loading zones really are one of the great life hacks. That five-minute time limit is rarely enforced, except, of course, when someone in this case, me  decides to be a concerned citizen and help the authorities enforce the laws that keep Stumptown safe. You talk so much. Bend that's where I had them tow your car. And if you go to the top of the block and hang a Louie, you should get there in... ...two days and seven hours. Except I don't think you're gonna be able to leave right away. What do you mean? Sorry. Hey, I took care of those unpaid parking tickets, okay? You can look into it. Ma'am, you're under arrest for vandalism. Wait. Why?! First rule of Artie  do not screw with Artie's Mustang. Suck it, Artie. How sweet it is to be loved by you. Alright. Okay. Should we just get you a desk here? Would that be easier? I want to file a police report against Artie Banks. Well, actually, we would file a report, and you would fill out something that we call a complaint. But you're gonna learn all about that when you become a licensed private investigator. What's the charge? Harassment. "Hair-essment." U-Uh, whatever the legal pronunciation is. Okay, and is this alleged harassment captured on high def on a magic doorbell security system? 'Cause this is. Not my all-time favorite booty call! Easily explained. Really? You see, the thing is, I also own a Mustang. You can look that up. And I confused his with mine. You thought you were attacking your own vehicle. Yeah, I, uh I read online, actually, that, um... my Mustang is the only model year where they built a piñata inside the car. It turns out that that was a hoax cooked up by one of those weirdo deep-Web guys. So, that is the last time that I ever believe anything I read on the Internet. Lesson learned. Ms. Parios, acts of vandalism involving more than $500 in damages are deemed to be a felony. It is punishable by up to a year in prison and significant fines. But you're in luck, because Artie Banks is a thieving ex-cop who is not in good standing with this department. So if you said you got your Mustang mixed up with his, well, then... case is closed. Justice has prevailed, and you are free to go. Seriously. Go. Yeah. Okay. Uh, w-what did Artie steal? $30,000 from the property room. The union brokered him a deal for him to resign with no charges. You know, time rolls on. People forget. I have not. Sorry, just one other thing - Yeah, we had your car towed back up. You're welcome. Goodbye. Hey. Dex, they're here for my baby! Okay. Candace, I-I'll be right there, alright? Are we dating? 'Cause it definitely feels like we're dating. Courtesy call. Okay. What's up? Look, man, this case is personal to me, and I know you've been lying to me about something. I just don't know what it is or why. I think you're a decent guy. Oh, okay. Yeah, we're definitely dating. Kane escaped from prison last night. Well, that is really unfortunate news. The feds think he's headed to Canada. What do you think? I think we should both keep our eyes open, protect the people around us that don't know what we know. Right. Hey! Hey! It's okay. It's okay. Don't make a scene. Not in front of my daughter. Candace, it's time. I love you. Good baby. Oh, God. It's alright. Oh, God. People don't change. Right, Artie? Life lesson number one. I can't believe I spent so much time wondering where it went wrong for you. You're a dirtbag, Artie. You know that? Because only a lifelong dirtbag would take an oath as a police officer and then turn around and steal from the department. Yeah. But thank you. Thank you for taking me under your wing, because now I know exactly the type of person I never want to be. What now? I don't know. You okay? Huh? Yeah, I'm fine, bud. No, you're not. That lady and her baby? My job is to help people. I, uh I made a promise I couldn't keep. They took me away. Who? The people in the black car. You remember that? I wasn't scared. You promised you would find a way. I knew you would. Yeah. Just a sec, okay? You do not know a thing about me. Uh, or do I know everything? Consider that possibility when you're driving away from my house, okay? No, no. Hey. Hey! You can't judge a man until you walk a damn mile in his shoes! Then and only then  I have to say something. May I please come in? Because I really... need to talk to someone. Ugh. You've got to be kidding me. Dex? You help people, right? I had a case... Witness Protection-type deal, 12 hours on, 12 hours off... for a week. In the off hours, I frequented a tavern two blocks from the hotel. I met a waitress. Nine months later, I got a call. She'd gone home to Tacoma. Baby girl. Child was born with... serious medical problems. They call it a neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage. An experimental treatment was floated to the mom, not covered by insurance. That's why I stole the $30,000 from the job. Procedure didn't take. And for the longest time, I thought I cared too much about other people, so maybe I should just... not. Make a lot of money, have fun, hold everyone at arm's length. But the truth was, I didn't care enough. Not the right way. The baby passed, the mother grieved, and I wasn't there for either one of them. Although I should have been. I'm sorry. If that even happened. But a world where I believe anything you say does not exist. Look, I know I've made misstatements. Yeah. A few. But when I saw Randall take the baby from Candace  She was your client, Artie. S-She trusted you. I know. And I'm sorry. Well, "sorry" is meaningless. "Sorry" won't get Candace her kid back. You want to feel better about yourself, give me something I can use. The only person who can decipher any of this is Tapper's ex-accountant, Homer Miller-McManus. Mr. McManus? Ms. Parios. How'd you know it was me? Wild guess. Not used to meeting prospective clients at bars. Who referred you, exactly? Oh, uh, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Langdon. The Langdons. I was talking to them about how I needed some help with my taxes, so... "Langdon" doesn't sound familiar. Oh. Uh, you want a beer, Mr. McManus? Um, no, thank you. Why don't we just have a look at your returns? Oh, great. Here they are. I think I'll be leaving now. We're gonna have a little chat first. Tapper threatened me. He made me sign an NDA. And yet here you are, discussing sensitive details about his fraudulent business with a private investigator hired by his wife? Whew! You got some cojones, bro. I haven't told you anything. Well, Tapper won't know that when he sees the photo of us, will he? What photo? Thanks, bro. Ooh! That does not look good. So, listen. Either you can get on the first plane out of town or you can help me take Tapper down. But I I  Tapper approached the tribe to build a school. He lowballed the offer, ensuring he'd win the contract, but also ensuring his margins would be tight. He knew he was gonna lose money on the project? Why would he do that? Ms. Parios, if you'd read the RFP, you'd know that Tapper oversold at a reduced cost. Now, knowing that reservations are loosely regulated  Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Homer, no offense to you or your chosen profession, but let's let's get to what Tapper was hiding, okay? Oh, wow. Ahh. He's moving something illegal in and out of that school he's taking forever to build. Okay. Hey. I, um, reached out to the warden, like you asked. You're not gonna believe who visited Kane two days before he escaped. Who? Can you explain this? I was approached at a market, and this man says to me, "Kane wants to see you." And he threatened me and Molly if I didn't go. Did you help him? Did you help him? No! What? No  Then what were you doing there? He said that Darius had something that was his, plans or something for a job that they were working on. He said he wanted them back. All I said was, "I don't know what you're talking about." What job? What job?! He He didn't say! Was it here in Portland? I don't know! Why didn't you just come to me? I could have protected you. Like you protected Darius? Um... Hey, buddy. What's up? They need you at the bar. Okay. Well, I'll be right out. Are you okay? Yeah. I'm great. Never thought I'd say this, but I'm beginning to like the feel of this team. So, now we're a team. The gristled, storied P.I. who regained his humanity and his trusted sidekick... How am I the sidekick? ...riding like cowboy avengers into the night. 'Course, you're gonna have to change your name. What's wrong with my name? It's un-letterhead-able. Banks and Parios? Come on. No one's gonna hire an outfit like that. You might want to kill your lights. Yeah. Nervous? No. Should I be? It's Stumptown, Dexedrine. Nothing good happens after dark. Don't call me that. You think I wouldn't find out? Using a colleague to get Kane's prison surveillance video? Just let me do my job. I'm trying to save your job, Miles. I'm telling you, Kane is planning something here in Portland. He's got some unfinished business. How do you know this? Because I'm in his head! Maybe he's in your head. Look, I have got to take you off this thing. It's not coming from me anymore. I answer to people, too. You got to just step back. This does not look good. Is that what this is about? No. You're losing it, Miles. You're way too close. And I'm starting to worry about you. Do you remember that trip to Hawaii that you wouldn't shut up about a while back? Lieutenant  Take it. Forget about Kane. You know I can't do that. That's exactly why you got to go. This is odd, right, all this activity here happening so late? Sovereign land, no government oversight. Whatever they're cooking out here, it is not a kosher meal. Let's check out the truck. It's just building materials. But is it? Can you gimme a hand? Chinese labels. What do you think? Oxy? Ain't Jujubes. I guess this means your client is a drug smuggler. Ex-client. Question is, does Sue Lynn know about it? Come on! I heard something in the truck! Artie, get back here!  Wait up! Let me see your hands. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yaaah! I spent two years in a Shaolin monastery in the Henan Province. Sure. Let's just take the evidence and get out of here, okay? Oh, no. Come on. Come on! Uh, they're coming! Dying to this song suddenly makes so much sense. Yes! I think we lost them. This is not good. Funny. We were just talking about you. So, you wanted to discuss the school. I've been looking at the projections. I know we're a tad behind schedule. Does two years qualify as a tad? Mrs. Blackbird, the federal permitting process is extremely arduous  When I started this casino, we were 10 slot machines, a gas station, and a diner. I'm well aware of the federal permitting process. Well, you should also be aware that I share your frustrations. Every delay costs me money. Personally, this project may be more trouble than it's worth. How smooth is the tongue that can make right look like wrong and wrong look like right. I have no idea what that is. Really? It came off a truck with your name on it. You're using this school as cover to distribute counterfeit pills. Lucky for you, I am, above all else, a businesswoman. So you can make a deal with me or you can make a deal with the DEA. I'm guessing my terms will be a tad more favorable. I'll give you a 15% stake. 30%. You're a tough negotiator, Mrs. Blackbird. You have a deal. Howdy, howdy! I'm so sorry I'm late. Traffic was bananas. What did I miss? What's this? Well, the last time we were here, you made me an offer. Now here's ours. You're gonna close down this little pharma company. You're gonna finish construction on the school. Additionally, at your own expense, a basketball gym, athletic field. Pool? Oh, for sure a pool, yeah. And you're gonna give full custody of the daughter you never wanted back to your ex-wife. Or what? Or video of this riveting luncheon goes to the authorities. Just look right back here. Surf or turf? I'm on the fence. Get 'em both. He's paying. You're paying, right? Doing a great job, pal. Thanks. You're welcome. Can I talk to you for a sec? Okay. How would you feel about taking a couple days off? Why? Oh, I don't know. Look at how hard you're working. Hell, practically everybody here thinks that you're running this place. I like it. I know you do, and I love having you here, okay? I love it. But it's not about that. Did I mess up? Did you mess up? No! It's actually the opposite of that. You know, when an employee does a a good job, Ansel  You know what? Scratch that. When an employee does a great job, that employee needs to be rewarded. I mean, that's  that's how capitalism works. That's the whole thing, right? So, I'd like you to go home, take a couple of days, and just chill, play video games. And you want to know what the best part is? What? You get paid  paid time off. You're getting paid not to be here. Okay? Don't get sad. You've earned this. Okay. Hi, angel. Hi, baby Mila. Yes. Ohh! I don't know what to say. I'm happy I could help. Cute kid. Mrs. Tapper  Candace. Of course. I just wanted to say... I'm sorry. I forgive you. We forgive you. Hey, baby. Mnh. You okay? I've got this strange sensation. Can't describe it. All over. It's like, uh... You give a crap? So that's what it feels like. Congratulations, Dexedrine. You are now a licensed private investigator in the state of Oregon. Don't I need my 1,500 hours? Didn't it feel like 1,500 hours? So, did you learn anything? People change. Does that count? If you ever need a sidekick... You will be my third call. See you around out there. Yeah. Hey. What was your daughter's name? Ariana. Okay. Alright. Okay. Aah! Sorry for the theatrics, Greyson. Yeah, I would have been cool with a pop-in. You owe me a half a million dollars. I understand, and I got a plan to pay that  I'll handle the plans from now, Greyson.
