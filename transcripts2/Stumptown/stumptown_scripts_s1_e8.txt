 Previously on "Stumptown"... You're officially a licensed private investigator. We're together, and her name is Liz, and you know that. You and Dex are... - Just friends. - Okay. At some point, I'd like to meet your brother. We host a little Thanksgiving thing, and you're welcome to come to that if you don't have any plans. Do you remember me? You're Benny's mom. Benny and I were in high school together.

 I thought that he was the one. Subject's marriage falls apart, joins the Army and deploys to Afghanistan, where his Humvee hits an IED, killing him instantly. You drew this? It's a work in progress. It's great, right? I told you she's a talent. Mm-hmm. I mean, it just... doesn't really look anything like me. It looks exactly like you. It's even got the scowl. Yep. There it is. It's effortless. You know, you don't have to use it. Yes, you do.

 Look, your Yelp page isn't getting any hits. This will help, Dex. Cool. It's you, Dex. I told ya. Hey, I didn't know you were a Tobin Heath fan. "Fan's" an understatement with this guy. She's my favorite player. She would love to hear you say that. You know Tobin Heath? Yeah, we played in college together. At North Carolina? You played college soccer? You are full of surprises. What? I'm looking for Dex Parios. I hear she skipped town. Doesn't sound like Dex. Well, you found me. What's this? Your retainer. As of this moment, I am officially your client. Someone's trying to destroy me. Well, that's a new one. It started with small things. They stole my wallet, they broke into my house. They laid a rotting fish on my windshield. Oh, what kind of fish? You think I sound crazy. Well, you said it. I thought so, too. But then NIGC audited the casino. As is their job. Everyone knows that. For the first time in 20 years. I do not believe in coincidence. No? Do you believe in karma? Then just yesterday, they laid a honey trap for me. I... I don't know... They sent a man to seduce me. Cool. Fun idea. He was precisely my type, but just a little too handsome, came on too strong. And I spotted the ruse. I'm sure he meant to record our time together and use it against me. Yeah, I'm sure. Um... who is "they"? That's why I'm here. I want you to find out who's behind all this before they do lasting damage. You know what? Save your money. Nobody cares enough about you to plan such a coordinated and, frankly, weird attack. It's not always about you, Sue Lynn. Ooh. Is that your car? It was yes. You believe me now? I'm $100 an hour, plus expenses. You believe this is an isolated incident? As far as I know, Officer. Sue Lynn. I'm sorry I wasn't able to be more helpful. - You okay? - I'm fine. - We should get going. - Mm. Will that be everything, Officer? For now. If you have any additional questions for the Head of the Confederated Tribes, you may do so... on our lands, at our convenience. You should have told her what you told me. I mean, someone is trying to kill you. Now's not the time to play hard to get, Sue Lynn. In my experience, the Portland Police Bureau does not have my best interests at heart. Lieutenant Cosgrove is not one of my biggest fans. So, we have that in common. Such a pleasure to be working with you again. Hollis will give you everything you need. Mm. What is this? Intel on her enemies? I was joking. Sue Lynn has run this tribe for 30 years. You don't do that without ruffling a few feathers here in Portland. This is, like, a lot of paperwork. You know, there's 141 names here. Business associates, politicians, gaming commissioners. It is going to take me weeks to sort through them all. Unless you don't. Why are you helping her, again? Okay, someone detonated her car. Yeah, and somebody should look into that, but why does that somebody have to be you? I'm not exactly fending off clients. I could use the cash. Yeah, says the person who gave 45 grand back out of principle. Look, I'm gonna say something to you, and you're gonna want to punch me in the face, but you're not gonna, because my nose is just crooked enough as-is. No promises. Look, you think if you impress Sue Lynn enough, she'll regret breaking up you and Benny and realize she should have picked you over Naomi. I just need the money. Dex, Liz wants to take me to a Thorns game! Hey! Dream come true! What else did I say, Ansel? She thinks I need permission. Is it cool, Dex, if I take him to a game? Yeah. It's cool. It's totally cool. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. - Okay. Have fun! We will! All right. Okay. Howdy, howdy. Okay, uh, this can't keep being a thing. Well, hello to you, too, Miles. Look, I know you have a habit of barging into my work, but, uh... we got to keep a low profile here. Mm. Right. So, you don't want me to play out my interrogation room fantasy? - Hey. - Hello. Why don't you, uh, tell me a little bit more about that? No, no, I get it. Work is work, and fun is fun, and we don't blur them. Well, I like a little bit of blurring. Detective, I'm here on business. Okay, how can I help you? So, the Sue Lynn Blackbird car bombing... what do you know? We don't have much. Security cameras came up bust... same as the witnesses. I'm waiting on bomb squad forensics, but without cooperation from the tribe... Well, that is why I am here... to cooperate. Um, I have a list of potential suspects from Sue Lynn's, uh, right hand. Sue Lynn know you're sharing this? I mean, does it matter? It's 141 names. Actually, you know what? 142. Liz Melero? Or, uh, it could be "Elizabeth." Um... she was a soccer player at UNC. Uh, Sue Lynn had some beef with her when she moved... to Portland. Okay. Where you going now? Uh, to look into the names that Sue Lynn and Hollis didn't give me. ♪ To the doubts that complicate your mind ♪ ♪ We belong to the light, we belong to the thunder ♪ ♪ We belong to the sound of the words ♪ ♪ We've both fallen under ♪ ♪ Whatever we deny or em... ♪ _ This is a closed service.

Some things never change. Naomi know you're here? What do you think? I think... you saved her daughter. That should count for something. I stole her husband. She stole him first. Ah, it's hard to believe Sue Lynn Blackbird is still running this place. Yeah, I guess. Is everyone still happy with her? Dex, what's this about? It's just a long time to be in power, is all. I figure some people might not like that. She's done good by us. Oh, come on, Nate. You've never been a company line kind of guy. Give me the dirt. Most people are happy. The casino is printing cash. The rec center's finally up and running. - But...? - But... some people think she's leaving money on the table. Big Stumptown logging company came in. They were gonna lease some of our land, and she shut them down without even hearing their offer. Why? You know Sue Lynn. She likes to keep it in the family. Okay. Hey, Naomi. You're trespassing. Naomi, be cool. It's all right. I'm not trying to pee on your territory. I'm... I'm working. I told Sue Lynn you'd do this. She gives you 141 suspects in Portland, and you come here looking for dirt. Because the attacks on her feel personal. Maybe. Or maybe 'cause if you find something wrong with this place, it'll justify what you did. I didn't do anything wrong. 12 years, and you still don't have the guts to come clean? Benny never got in one fight in his life, and you want me to believe he just up and joined the military on his own? That's what happened. Now, if you had begged him... Naomi, he followed me, okay? He... Say it. Go ahead. Tell me you're not the reason Nina lost her father. I lost him, too. Go back to Portland, Dex. You don't belong here. Yeah. Yeah, that is, uh, that is crystal clear. And you just skewer it, like that. Can I ask you a question? Of course. Anything. How much do you make? Oh. Uh, Ansel, that's not the kind of thing people usually talk about. You said "Anything." You're right. I did. 20 bucks an hour. Yeah. But between you and me... he's overpaying me. - Hey, Liz. - Hmm? What do you think? Are you sure you don't want to just use a photo of her? No, this is great. It's... It's eye-catching. Dex hates it. Dex doesn't hate it. She's just not good at expressing her emotions. The woman has zero poker face. Ah, she's more of a craps girl. I get it. I'm an intruder. Okay, no, you are not. This is my bar, okay? I invited you, I hired you. You are super welcome here. And it doesn't bother you if your best friend doesn't feel the same way? No, look, Dex is like... she's like a frozen dinner. You just got to knock her against the counter a couple times really hard to loosen her up. You'll see. Come on in. The tip to check out logging companies was a good one. Looks like there's a connection between Marigold Logging and someone on the reservation. I'm gonna head out there this afternoon, try and follow up. Confederated Tribal Land is not within our jurisdiction. Car blew up in our town. Yeah. And we're working the case. So, unless I'm missing something, there's no evidence that this lead has anything to do with the car bombing. Right, but Dex thinks there's a... Ah. So your girlfriend has a hunch? She's not my girlfriend. Hmm. Everyone knows? Janitorial knows. Let her work the lead. At least she's not bound by federal oversight. Roger that. Lieutenant, let me ask you something. What went down between you and Sue Lynn Blackbird? Can you shut the door on the way out? Hmm. ♪ Unsealed, on a porch, a letter sat ♪ ♪ Then you said, "I wanna leave it again" ♪ Door's open. ♪ Once, I saw her on a beach ♪ ♪ Of weathered sand ♪ ♪ And on the sand, I wanna leave it again ♪ ♪ On a we... ♪ Are you trying to blow your eardrums out? It's the only way to listen to Pearl Jam. It's, uh... It's not a good time, Miles. Yeah, look, I, uh, caught a break in the Sue Lynn car bombing. Okay, well, you can tell Sue Lynn about it. I quit. Mm. I didn't take you for a wallower. I'm always wallowing. I just usually do it more artfully. You know, you were right. There is something going on with Marigold Logging. You miss the part where I quit? Nah, I'm just skipping ahead. I need you on this one, Dex. Tribe is just gonna stonewall me. And what makes you think they're not gonna do the same to me? They don't want me there. They never have. They think that I-I wanted to take Benny away from them. I would never do that. Yeah, I let him go. I-I left the state. I never asked for him to follow me. I j... Dex. I get it. You wanted them to accept you. I'm a black man from Portland. I've been there. Well, there you go, turning my broken heart into white girl problems. That's not what I meant. It is. And you're right. So, what'd you find? When was the last time you spoke to anyone at Marigold Logging? Six months ago? Eight. They approached us in early April. We closed the door on their offer. Hmm. Well, somebody did not get the memo. Cellphone tower logged 21 calls since then between Marigold Logging and this number, belonging to a burner phone purchased on the reservation. Someone has been dealing behind your back. What about the 141 names we gave you? You know, for a minute, I let myself believe that you hired me because I am good at my job, but the truth is, you just wanted someone you can control. That's how it always is with you. You like your world neat and tidy and under your own surveillance. You want me to find out who is doing this to you? You need to let me follow this case wherever it goes. What do you need? Access. Anyone I want to talk to, any documents I want to read. Anything. You'll need a guide. Tribal council would never agree to have an outsider rifling through our affairs unsupervised. - I can take her. - No. No way. I-I can't work with your lackey questioning my every move. You can't be serious. Make sure Dex gets everything she needs. Don't let her out of your sight. I'm gonna need a bonus for this. $5,000. For... you know, emotional damage. Okay. You're wrong about me, you know. I never tried to steal your husband. I-I wasn't taking his calls. I-I didn't even know he joined up. Whatever. I don't want to hear it. I would've said no. If Benny proposed. What do you want? A lollipop? I just thought you should know that, okay? What, exactly? That in some hypothetical world, where my husband were still alive, you'd give me back your sloppy seconds? What a martyr you are. Let's get this over with. So, uh, you're the manager here? I guess. You guess? Don't let her push you around, Joe. Everything I want. Remember? Okay? Um, so, these purchase records aren't complete, Joe. I know for a fact that someone bought a burner phone here on April 23rd. Why don't I see it listed here? Probably paid cash. Those are our credit card receipts. Okay, well, where are your cash records? All right. I am gonna need to see the security footage from that day. That camera hasn't worked since 2017. Tribal council keeps denying my request to fix it. So, the tribal council controls where the money goes? This trading post hasn't been robbed since before I was born. Updating the security system would have been a waste of resources. No offense, Joe. Was the council on board when Sue Lynn rejected the logging offer? - Of course. - No. Not by a long shot. I want to see them. That'll have to wait. They're in session. It's closed to outsiders. Hmm. It's really cute that you think that you're in charge. The council has strict rules. No cellphones in session. No talking. Won't even know I'm there. I know the grand piano is expensive, but if this council would just allocate a percentage of what you usually spend on the athletic facilities... And she just lost the crowd. Never try to take the sportsball money. Are you kidding? I told you... no cellphone. 10 bucks one of them has the burner on them. I'll be discreet. Nothing about you is ever discreet. Naomi, someone is trying to kill Sue Lynn. For all we know, they're planning to do it again. So, if there is a chance that he or she is sitting out there, I'm gonna find out. So, just let me do my job. Okay, wait for it. Who's that? In front of the computer. Leigh Green... Hollis' nephew. The council secretary. Front jacket pocket. Could be anything. It's not. Leigh's a good kid. Engaged politically, cares about the tribe. He would never hurt Sue Lynn. Well, we'll find out. I cannot let you interrupt the session. This is our guy, okay? I can smell it on him. Fine. You know what? You want to bulldoze your way through this? Go ahead. I guess that's your thing. Well, I'd kill for some popcorn. Or whiskey. Some earplugs, so I don't have to... hear you constantly. Got the forensics back from the bomb squad. Amateur hour fizzle bomb made from class C fireworks. Let me guess. The same type they sell on the reservation. Ugh. I can already feel a jurisdictional migraine coming on. Here you go. So, what do you want to do, then? Call the feds? Oh, God, no. They won't have somebody on this for months. The case'll freeze over. Dex is still working the case. I can just backchannel with her. Please tread lightly. Sue Lynn finds out that we've crossed jurisdictional lines, this migraine is gonna hospitalize me. Now it's time to muddle. It takes about 3 1/2 turns to extract the flavor for the perfect blackberry smash. All right, your break's almost over. What are you watching? Cocktail-making videos? I want to be a bartender. You do? Does Dex know? I'm 21. I know you're 21. And look, if you really want to learn to bartend, you don't need videos. You got the best bartender in Portland right here. Liz. Did you say "Liz"? No, me. You're messing with me. Go back to work. "Liz." What a wise guy. You hear that? Yeah. You're good with him. Oh, I love him. He's lucky to have you. I think you got it backwards. I'm lucky to have him. He keeps me grounded, keeps me out of trouble. Hmm. Sometimes I wish I knew you back then. I'm the same guy... just less angry. Less dangerous. Oh, so it's the danger you like, huh? Mm. Probably more in theory than in practice. Well, I can always roleplay. Leigh Green? I'm Dex Parios. Your Uncle Hollis and I go, uh, go way back. You know that outsiders aren't allowed in session. Not my choice, trust me. She's here on Sue Lynn's say-so. I'd like to see your, uh, cellphone... the one in your jacket pocket. The one you paid cash for. Uh... no. - Show me your phone. - What is this, Naomi? Don't worry. I told her you had nothing to hide. Just let her do a quick search, and we'll be on our way. Uh, eh... Don't do this, kid. I am much faster than I look. Don't you... Ah. Could be anything. I hate you. My colleague Detective Miles Hoffman... he had a very interesting conversation with the VP of Marigold Logging. The VP knows you very well. Seems you told him that you were negotiating on behalf of the tribe. Maybe I was. Except Sue Lynn rejected that offer eight months ago. Sue Lynn's isolationist outlook is running this tribe into the ground. You sound like Benny. You're probably too young to really remember him, but Benny used to say that kind of stuff all the time. He was nicer about his mom, though, of course. He knew the choices that she had to make... the awful things she saw when she was young, the fear that she carries with her every day. But he also thought her need to protect would end up hurting the tribe. It has. Mm-hmm. So you... wanted to stop her. Someone had to. It's 2019. The world is getting more inclusive by the day, and she makes us go through disenrollment? It's insane! Is that why you tried to kill her? What? No. We need to know what you used to make the car bomb, Leigh. Bomb? What bomb? N... I-I wanted Sue Lynn out of office. That's... That's it. I-I-I've never touched a bomb in my life. Gimme a sec. Seriously? Just following orders. Sorry. Uh, what do you have? So, turns out Leigh Green was at Marigold Logging yesterday for a meeting. Security cameras have him on-site from 8:00 to 11:00... the same time the car bomb was planted. Unless he has an accomplice, there's no way he could have done it. Damn. Well, thanks. Hey, Dex. How you holding up? Yeah, Fine. I'm fine. I gotta go, Miles. I'll talk to you later. You call the detective "Miles"? Yes, Naomi. He has seen me naked. Your observation skills are impeccable. Okay, so, you wanted Sue Lynn out. How? What was your plan? A-A vote of no confidence. That would have to be unanimous. Every member of the tribal council would have to agree. Who else was in on it? No one yet. I-I was waiting till I closed the logging deal. You little backstabbing creep. What about your Uncle Hollis? Oh, hell no. No, Hollis is Sue Lynn's lapdog through and through. Uh, you're not gonna tell him about this, are you? Uncle Hollis, you have to understand... Uh, don't dig any deeper, kid. Your nephew betrayed you, he betrayed Sue Lynn, but I don't think he's the one who blew up her car. No, whoever did that had a deeper, more personal vendetta against her... someone who lost everything because of her. I understand Sue Lynn has been disenrolling members. So, you remove people from their homes, banish them. It's more complicated than that. Well, less mouths, more casino winnings for whoever's left. If Sue Lynn did what you're implying, she did it to protect this tribe. Sure. Sure. Sue Lynn's M.O... Preserve and protect those with the blood and throw the rest of us to the curb. I'm gonna need a list of names. Okay, here's the thing, Hollis. I don't care about your nephew's power grab, okay? But Sue Lynn, on the other hand? When she wants to cut someone out of her life, she cuts thorough and deep. But she doesn't have to know about this. Empty threat, with Naomi here. You don't tell Sue Lynn, she will. Tell her what? I didn't hear a thing. I'm gonna need a list of names of every person you removed from the reservation. Those records were sealed by the tribal courts. Well... unseal them. Or I turn in your nephew for staging a coup. I'm sorry, Uncle Hollis. Oh, he knows, buddy. You have two hours. All right, how's another? Okay. Hey. You working late? Sorry. I should've called sooner. No, it's all good. Yeah, everything's fine. Ansel's fine. Liz is giving him a ride home. Hey, Dex, you there? Liz is... is giving him a ride? I think what you mean to say is "Thank you" to Liz for doing Ansel a favor. Right. Well... I mean, you know, it wouldn't kill you to spend a little time with her. She works at the bar. All I do is spend time with her. All right, just put in a little effort, please. I have been nothing but a gentleman to the parade of people you have dated over the years. Okay, don't slut-shame me. I'm friend-shaming you. You're being a bad friend. Look, I actually like this one, Dex. And when does that ever happen? Call you back. I fell in love with him when I was 6 years old. I saw him playing the drum, and I just told myself right then I'd marry him someday. Then I waited for him to notice me. And one day, he did, and it all played out so perfectly, I didn't look too close. Didn't care to find out who he really was or what he wanted. He wanted to lead his people. More than that. He wanted you. I should've let him go earlier. - Maybe he'd still be... - Stop. That kind of talk is just gonna spin you out. Trust me, I know. I have been spinning for 12 years. This wasn't your fault. You can't blame yourself. I kicked him out. I was so sick of his moping, listening to that Pearl Jam song, and staring at old photos of you. I snapped. He's dead because of me. No, he's not. You know, I can't tell you much about... Benny's death. So you're just gonna have to trust me. What happened over there... that wasn't on you. It's not what you think, Dex. There are seven names on that list. Seven. This wasn't about casino profits or purification or politics. Those seven people broke our rules. Made other members feel unsafe. Every community has a few rotten eggs. Sue Lynn used disenrollment to remove ours. I know these names. They were in the 141 files. No mention of disenrollment, though. I should have been more forthcoming. Trust is difficult for me. So are apologies, apparently. Lieutenant. Russ Foster, 22. Sue Lynn had him disenrolled from the tribe two months ago. You like him for the car bombing? Well, he's the only one of the disenrolled who has a Portland address and fits the profile. Parents are deceased, no living relatives. He was picked up on possession last year, but the charges were dropped. Do you remember those, uh, three teens that O.D.'d on the res last year? Yeah. Well, the timing lines up with Foster's possession charge. I think he sold those kids the opiates that killed them. Sue Lynn excommunicated him for it. That sure is a hell of a motive. - Let's bring him in. - Right. Charlie 16. We have breach units inside. Perimeter secured. Copy that, Charlie 16. Mr. Foster?

It's a felony for a police officer to investigate someone on personal charges... five years' jail time. I did not know that. You knew it was wrong. Or you would've come out and asked me. Do you have feelings for Grey? What?! No! If you do, just... No, Liz is spending a lot of time with Ansel. I'm just trying to be a good big sister. You used me. I screwed up, okay? That's... kind of a thing I do. I'm sorry. Lieutenant. I understand you have a prisoner in your lockup. Russ Foster. You didn't have to come all the way down here to thank us. Next time, I like a Chianti with a little age on it. Your captain's getting a phone call from the feds right now. They dropped the case. I am not gonna let you do this again. I'm afraid it's out of your hands, Lieutenant. We were by the book. Crime happened on our street, suspect was arrested in Portland. It was contained to a reservation-owned vehicle. Our property, our jurisdiction. And we choose not to press charges. Russ is one of ours. We'll handle things internally. Hold on. You had him disenrolled. He will be re-enrolled. Now... where is he? Hey. What are you gonna do with him? Ah, don't worry about it. We don't have stockades on the reservation. Sue Lynn. Come on. When we lost those three kids, broke my heart. I needed someone to blame, and Russ was the easiest target. Turned my back on him when he needed us the most. I will not make that mistake twice. $5,300 good? Yeah, I take cash or check. See if you can make it to the cashier before placing a bet. Why did you really pair me and Naomi up? What do you think? That you thought we were gonna work through everything?

You only look like this when you feel guilty. So, what, you blow things up with your cop friend? No, Hoffman and I are good. Weirdly good, actually. Great. Well, I just love to hear that. You know, you're wrong about Sue Lynn. I-I don't need her approval. I... I need her forgiveness. Forgiveness for what? There are things I have never told you... never... told anyone. Um... things that happened in Kabul. Uh... Sorry I took so long. Ansel and I got caught up watching old UNC games. I had no idea they had all that stuff on YouTube. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something? No. No, you're not. I have a date with a craps table. Oh, you play craps? No, she loses at craps. That's the one with the dice, right? I always thought it looked so fun. You a craps virgin? Oh, you just stepped in it. You see, Dex doesn't believe in much, but she does believe in beginner's luck. What are you doing right now? U-Uh, working. Well, she's clocking out early. Okay? - Oh, she is? - Mm-hmm. You wanted us to spend some time together, so this seems like a good opportunity. Sounds fair. - You want to go? - Yeah.
