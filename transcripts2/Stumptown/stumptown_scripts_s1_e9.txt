 You guys treat me like a little kid.
 How much do you make? 20 bucks an hour.
 Watching you two together,
 I don't want to get in between anything.
 We are just friends. You can trust me.
 She is perfect, right?
 I don't know. She seems really, like, happy.
 Just put in a little effort, please.
 I actually like this one, Dex.
 You wanted us to spend some time together,
 this seems like a good opportunity.

 Hi. Dex Parios.
 I think we spoke on the phone.
 Oh, my God.
 Penny Lansdale?
 Perfect Penny?
 You got to be kidding me.
 Dex.
 It's been a minute. Yeah.
 When Michael mentioned it was you we were
 going to see, I nearly choked.
 Perfect Penny?
 Cute little name Dex had for me in high school.
 Didn't I have one for you, too?
 Mm‐hmm. Dirty Dex.
 Yeah.
 Not all of us could afford three manicures a week.
 Please. Who had time for more than two?
 Ladies, save the reunion.
 Yeah. My office.
 We accept Jennifer's made mistakes, as kids do.
 And if what she is accused of was in the realm of possibility,
 we'd accept it and move on.
 Jennifer: But it's not.
 Somebody planted those pills on me.
 Okay, just, uh, tell me what happened.
 I left school, opened my backpack,
 and found a baggie of prescription pills
 that somebody had put there ‐‐ 200 Adderall.
 Felony number.
 I went straight to the principal's office,
 showed them what I found.
 10 minutes later, I was arrested.
 Penny: They said an anonymous tip had come in
 that she was a drug dealer on campus,
 that the drugs were hers.
 What dealer would hand over their product
 to the Principal?
 The DA is arguing that Jennifer knew the call was coming in,
 that she was trying to "get in front of it."
 What is the response from the school?
 Oh, their response is good riddance.
 We do have one ally ‐‐ Deputy Principal Markham.
 But she wasn't able to prevent the expulsion,
 which came as a swift kick in the ass.
 In general, New Season High School
 has turned their back.
 Oh, this is New Season?

 It's a progressive oasis.
 But they do not like their apple cart being upset.
 They close ranks. And Alyssa Frank ‐‐

 I will keep that in mind.
 Um, can you pull up
 Jennifer Harris's arrest report?
 Any information on the arrest
 should come from the family lawyer.
 Except there's no record
 of an anonymous call targeting Jennifer Harris.
 It's not like the cops showed up and grabbed an honor student.
 My theory?
 Call came from inside the school,
 and they didn't want it in the file.
 Maybe someone applied pressure to the department
 to have it expunged.

 Uh, no. It can't wait.
 I'm a sub here today,

 my psychology degree to good use
 and speak to specific students
 about the recent expulsion of Jennifer Harris.
 So, I'm here.
 I just wanted to, um...
 check in, see how you're feeling.
 This school is so idiotic.
 [ Headphones clatter ] So, um...
 tell me how you're feeling about Jennifer's expulsion.
 Any guilt about taking over
 her starting position on the team? No.
 You didn't have any problems with her? Nope.
 Okay. Do you think she deserved to get kicked out of school?
 I would say anyone packing a fat sack of beans
 is violating policy.
 Beans. Pills. Uppers.
 I don't care that she got booted.
 We weren't close.
 Everybody know she was dealing drugs?
 Maybe. I wasn't in her circle.
 She didn't have a circle. She was nothing.
 How does this apply to my psychological health?
 Uh... it's an experimental assessment.
 Look, Jennifer was busted
 because of an anonymous call coming from a classroom phone.
 The exact classroom that you were in.
 Call came in at 2:56, which is right after class gets out.
 You were the one to most benefit from this whole situation.
 Yeah, I wasn't there.
 I gotta go.
 Hey. You were checked in.

 Five years as coach.
 So, the culture is basically in my DNA.
 For better or worse.
 Want to take a walk?
 Yeah, sure.
 This, uh, Jen ordeal really breaks my heart.
 You know, super sweet kid, talented player.
 But you thought she was selling pills?
 Or was planning on it, or...
 You know, I‐I don't know. I don't know.
 But it is exactly the kind of thing
 a kid like that would do
 to find a group in a place like this.
 Whatever happened to throwing a keg party?
 [ Chuckles ] For real.
 I doubt anyone would even show up.
 I mean, look.
 This place has entitlement problems.
 You know?
 Lots of alpha behavior,
 which, personally, I try and push my way through,
 but for less aggressive kids,
 it's easy to get lost and desperate.
 Like Jennifer. Yeah.
 Look, Dex, I'm sure you've got the best of intentions here,
 but her parents will spend millions
 before they admit their kid is less than perfect.
 Karma wise...

 C‐Can we, uh, fast forward a little bit?
 I just want to see how much more I had to drink.
 What's the point, Dex? [ Sighs ]
 I'm just trying to see how I behaved.
 Fact that it takes an eye in the sky to determine that
 is something I...consider a problem.
 Yeah, I'm just trying to gather the facts, okay?
 Uh‐huh.
 Okay, wait. Right there!
 Do you see that? Look at that.
 Okay, um, can you go

 Wait, she's dumping her drink in my glass.
 I mean, she's trying to get me drunk.
 Maybe she can't keep up.

 Clean up.

 I'm gonna wait till my lawyer gets here

 Cosgrove: That is your right.
 We've contacted him, and he's on his way.
 It's, um ‐‐
 It is compelling, the idea that she sold the pills
 because the school's so competitive.
 Well, she's been in their shoes.
 Probably how she got through school back in the day.

 that three girls from New Season
 have been sent to rehab for prescription stimulants.
 [ Inhales deeply ] In my experience,
 addicts can turn others to addiction
 because it makes them feel less guilty
 about their troubles.
 So...literally,
 they "make" friends?
 All right.
 Well, I guess by her having rich donor parents,
 she can get away with something like that.

 Nope.

 I was told the school is gonna be in touch
 about reinstatement.
