 I'd love to show you my world. Uh, you mean like go to a jazz concert? Bowling. Super sexy. I'm glad you came. I built businesses right here in Oregon, created jobs for hardworking Oregonians, like my dad and his dad before him. Oregon never follows. We always lead, and I want to continue leading us into a future that works for you. I am Llewellyn Slocombe, and I want your vote for State Senate. This message was approved of and paid for

 by the political action committee Slocombe for Oregon State Senate. Vanessa is ready for you. Great. Okay, whenever you're ready. This is a redraft. We're against tort reform on a state level, but we're for it nationally. Write it more confusing so the voter has no idea what we're talking about. I'm gonna need a salad Niçoise in 45 minutes, and send them a video how to poach a fish. You went up against Randall Tapper. Uh, yeah. I mean, somebody had to. Right. Well, it cost him. He pulled his campaign donation. I mean, I'm not gonna hold that against you. Or will I? Will you? I don't know. Let's find out. Whiskey? Uh, it's 11:00 a. m., so, yes, of course I will. Elliot! Two refreshers! Uh, give me the room. What do you know about Dan Gibson? Councilman Dan? Uh...gay, married... seems smart. I don't know. I want to destroy Dan Gibson. Okay. I want to reduce him to ash, and then I want to have a private ceremony, and by "private," I mean "public ceremony," where the proud people of Oregon watch me scatter his remains over the mountains, out to the high desert to be forgotten forever. Cool beans. Oh. Thank you, Elliot. Um, why am I here? I have one month to get voters to punch the ballot for my guy, Llewellyn Slocombe. You're gonna find my October Surprise. So, let me get this straight. You want me to destroy Councilman Dan? He's selling squeaky clean. Nobody in politics is that good. He has a secret. You're gonna sniff it out, and you're gonna bring it to me, and I'm gonna detonate his soul. Yeah, I don't know. Politics? It's not really my bag. Are you sure you got the right girl? It's 50 grand. 5 up front, 45 on receipt of dirt dirty enough to bury Dan Gibson. Yeah. Yeah, okay. I'll just move some things around in my schedule, but, yeah. Vanessa. Vanessa. Uh, security found a package that may contain some anthrax. Anti‐vaxxers. Betcha a finski. Yeah. Okay, so, I just need that check for the 5 grand. Oh. Oh, you don't think ‐‐ you don't think we're good for ‐‐ She doesn't think we're good for it. Well... Okay. As a sign of good faith, I am gonna give you my gas mask. Gee, thanks. Elliot, give me yours. I'm gonna need that check, sport. I don't want to die for $12 an hour. You were amazing last night. Oh, was I? Oh, my God. My heart stopped. Twice. Well, you should know ‐‐ it was my first time. Oh. Could've fooled me. Really? I actually recorded it. Well, do I want to watch it? Oh, you want to see it. It, um ‐‐ I think we should probably watch it together. Oh, no. Mm‐hmm. Grey, keep that freaking elbow up. Oh! Good. I mean, elbow up. That's good advice. Yeah. My brother Edgar ‐‐ two‐time Northwest Backyard Axe Toss champ. What? Where did I find you? Um, I found you. At your bar. Literally begged you to take me home. So... Glad you did. Alright. Let's get started. Um...I have an awkward question. Okay. Well, I have an awkward answer. Can I have a job? So, you're gonna ruin Councilman Dan's career? That's the gig? Wow, your new lady really put you through your paces, huh? No, this is about the cool‐down. I forgot to do the cool‐down. The cool‐down is just as important as a warm‐up. I think we're off‐topic. Here's the thing, though ‐‐ Councilman Dan seems like a really good person. I thought you were doing all this to help the good guys. Well, there are no good guys in politics, which is sexist, by the way. Okay. Everyone likes him. You, be yourself. Don't just follow the in‐crowd, okay? You're gonna make everyone hate him. No, I'm not. I'm sure he is a monster deep down, like everyone else. If someone's gonna vote for Councilman Dan, they deserve to know the truth. It's the obliques. That's what's really hurting. Uh‐huh. Yeah, I hurt my obliques. She did this thing with her leg, where ‐‐ Oh, yeah, an anchor baby. It's when you wrap around and there's a lot of compression on the low back ‐‐ But we don't need to... we don't need to get into it. And since when do you care about the truth? Well, since the truth started to pay. "Dan Can Do It." Mm‐hmm. Oh, you're going undercover. I sure am. Gotta start somewhere. Hello. Uh, Dex...Gladstone reporting for duty. Carol. I run the phone bank. Oh, I got you pegged, Carol. "Team leader ‐‐ Carol." Oh. Geez. Of course, of course. Tempeh ball? Oh, no. Not in this universe or any other. Suit yourself. They are quite yummy. Now ‐‐ Oh! Thank you. So, um, where do you, uh, want me? My background is mostly in administration, so if Dan needs help at his desk ‐‐ Oh, no, he has four assistants. He's completely covered. Okay. Oh. Hardware issues. Welcome. So, uh, so, fundraising, then? That is a good guess. Hmm. Here's your script. Now, there's no quota per se, but a good goal is 30 contacts per shift. Mm. Convert eight of those, and that's a win. Wonderful. And, uh, and the man himself? He'll be in. You'll know. Why are you here? Oh. Uh... I'm sorry, what? We all know Dan is on a rocket to Washington. He has his eye on the big chair. Look at these killers. No, come on. This is the future of our country, and these people know that they are riding a gravy train all the way to D. C. Now, let me ask you again ‐‐ why are you here? Mm‐hmm. You know, I just want to know if Dan is really too good to be true. So, if I'm gonna hitch this wagon to the gravy train, I need to know who I'm following. Let's get you started. Okeydokey. Oh, geez. Don't go esoteric. Hey, I'm the customer. You know what? I'll have what he's having. Vodka‐vodka‐pineapple. I'll have a Manhattan. Okay. Coming up. What? No martini glasses? Do you have Carpano Antica? Look, I got what I got. I'll grade you on a curve, okay? Alright. So, what's the barback situation? He's at soccer practice. Thursdays, I'm on my own. Oh. Pushover. Can I have a week off for Christmas? Okay, 1  you're not hired yet, 2 absolutely not, and, 3  it's complicated. He's a great kid, and I give him Thursdays off for soccer and Saturdays if he's got a game. Alright. Straw. You gotta finish it. Nice final touch. Damn, that's a pretty good drink. 20 bucks an hour, and I don't pool tips. She's a deal at twice the price. And I'm good‐looking, too. Don't hop in, Danny. Just stop. What do you say about tomorrow night, we go out? My buddy's band is playing. They're not good. They're actually bad, but they're loud. What do you say? We are going out? Huh. Bold move. I like it. Hello, uh... Jill Woods, my na‐‐ Uh, Claire Kennedy ‐‐ Whoa. You ‐‐ You ‐‐ You kiss your mother with that mouth? Okay, well, don't answer the phone while you're in the bath if it's an unknown number. That would... Yeah, you have a great d‐‐ They tell you one in five calls pays out, but it's really like one in 15 in my experience. Archie, the last campaign I worked on ‐‐ uh, we had a lot of confidential materials coming in. Do we have a policy for that here? Yeah, we shred every night. Dan's a stickler. Never saves a piece of paper. Okay, so, if I wanted something shredded, I would just ‐‐ I'd go in there? What? No. Give it to Carol. "Walk in there." The Councilman's busy. Rewriting the future. Of course. You know, I've never even met him. Oh, no? Oh. Shh! I don't ‐‐ I just ‐‐ I don't understand. Don't panic. Don't. How can they just ‐‐ They can just cancel? It's alright. That's... We ‐‐ We've got the church as an option. We just ‐‐ We need something. I never gossip. Oh, but please do. But the venue for tonight's fundraiser fell out. Talk about a turd sandwich. We were all gonna go. The whole office? Yeah, as a thank‐you. But I guess we're stuck here, burning the midnight oil ‐‐ again. You know, I know a venue that we can get into super last‐minute. You would be our hero. Papa needs a new pair of mai tais. He sure does. Let's get it for him. I just want to thank you, uh, for your contributions. You really saved our bacon tonight ‐‐ both of you. Yeah, could not agree more. Thank you so much. Well, happy to help. I really like the slogan. Uh, "Be You, Be True, Be Portland." "Be You, Be True, Be Portland." So, we can count on your vote? I'd vote 10 times if I could. And he might try. Convicted felon. ‐Oh. ‐He's a business owner now. That's why he's so into, um, criminal justice. Hey, well, then you know how important sentencing reform is to me. We are gonna overturn Measure 11 and get back to common‐sense prison terms. Go out there and save it for the stump speech. I'm sorry. Listen to me. I can't shut it off. But it's true. We will. It's all silly. Alright, you two have fun. We'll see you out there. Alright. What was that? What? I was just ‐‐ I was making small talk. Get better at small talk. What were you doing in there? You were kissing some serious political ass. I don't know. Maybe I could do business with him. He seems honest. Well, maybe. I'll find out. I cannot believe you dragged me into all this. I had to empty out their office somehow, okay? And you're welcome for all of the paying customers, you know? Yeah, that's true. Huh. You got her tending bar now, huh? Yeah, just trying her out. That didn't sound good. It's a trial period, and so far, so good. Mm‐hmm. Okay. What? W‐‐ It ‐‐ Nothing. She just, you know... she seems a little young. Young? Hey. Hey. Uh, question... Dan for Senate. Alright. Oh, look how good that looks. Thank you so much for coming. We appreciate your, uh, support. Detective. Tonight, I'm just here to support a good man. Thanks for the invite. When did everybody get into politics? Middle school, and you're the one wearing the T‐shirt. Oh. Yeah, this is a long story. Hey, look, um... if it's cool with you, at some point, I'd like to meet your brother. Oh. Uh...yeah. You know what? Actually, we ‐‐ we host a little Thanksgiving thing. Um...and you're welcome to come to that, if you don't have any plans. Ah, anything I can do to avoid my family, I'm down. Please put your hands together for your next state senator, Dan Gibson. Thank you. Thank you, Bad Alibi! Thank you all so much for being here. It means so much to me. Wow. Um..."Be You, Be True." My slogan, right? I want to tell you what it means to be me and why I'm here working so hard to represent all of you. Uh, also, for any of you who might have wandered into the wrong event tonight, by the way, I'm Dan Gibson. Okay? Yeah. And this is my campaign manager, my husband, Antony. Uh, this handsome fella. And so, if I wander, if I'm wandering from my prepared remarks... Alright, I'm gonna go. You're gonna miss the prepared remarks. ...just talk to him... I'll be right back. You won't miss me. Alright. ...'cause he's always keeping a list. You guys look great tonight. Really, it means so much to me... Come on. Hey, Carol. You know, I think I, uh, lost my clipboard ‐‐ Uh‐huh. Uh‐huh. What's with the letter? What letter? The one that's behind your back. Oh, this letter? This is a personal letter. My grandmother, uh ‐‐ You know what? I got a bad vibe from you from jump. Now, give me that letter before I have to bust your ass. Oh, alright. Yeah, I know who you are, Gladstone. You're not the only private dick Slocombe hired. You're undercover. Yeah. I'm working sly, and you have popped a squat on my turf. This is insane. You're after the October Surprise? I'm after $75K. Same as you. 75? No, they told me 50. Yeah, well, grow up. You're working for scum, and now you're digging in on scum. Okay, listen, we're cool. Doesn't have to be like this, okay? You know what? If I see you here tomorrow, we're gonna have problems. The letter. Okay. Oh! Hey, pal. Just wanted to make sure you're good with your sister going out of town for the day. Where's she going? The University of Northern Oregon. But she'll be back for Friendsgiving. She promises. It won't be long. Let's run through this. How do you lock this place up? Windows, porch light, side door, and back door. Perfect. And what do you do if you see something you don't like? I touch my nose with my tongue. Alright. Little smart ass. You're messing with me. I text the word "apple." Right, and then I'll be wherever you are. You guys treat me like a little kid. We do? You do. Well, I'm sorry. I don't see you as a little kid. I see you as a man, and I see you as a friend. We cool? I'm cool. Great. Also, you're out of milk, so figure that out, tough guy. Uh, Professor Gopalin? I went by for office hours. I'm hiding from my juniors. Oh. Just handed back their midterms. Are you a student here? Oh, no. Wow. I am flattered. Thank you. No, I'm here about, uh, Dan Gibson. Councilman Dan? I can't imagine why. Well, he was on the faculty here. He worked in the econ department with you, and you were in contact with him recently. I'm with his campaign. I ‐‐ We were not in ‐‐ You sent him a letter last week. I haven't seen Dan in a decade, since he was an associate professor. I was just wishing him luck. Okay. But he held on to your letter, and I understand why. It was very...intimate. You read it? Yes. Yes, you said that you were proud of him for living his truth, and I guess I'm just wondering what lie he was living with way back when. Sometimes a letter's just a letter. I apologize if you wasted your time coming out here. Detective. It's been too long. Oh, just long enough. What do I owe the pleasure? Uh, I am here to report a break‐in. Mm. And what walked off on you? You ‐‐ You don't want to get a pen? Oh, let's hear the story first. The break‐in ‐‐ was it, uh, was it your house? Dan Gibson's campaign office, burglarized by your friend Dex Parios. So, you would like to report her? Oh, no, I'm ‐‐ I'm ‐‐ I'm not at liberty to do that. Technically, I shouldn't have been there to witness the break‐in. Okay, so, what would you like me to do? Bring her in. Get her off the street. Scare her straight. Get her off the streets? Yes. And I assume that you already tried to do this yourself? Um...that conversation ended prematurely. She beat feet. But if you tell me where she's at, I'd be happy to talk to her. Carol, why are you still doing this? You got to be in your late... Watch it. ...30s. Mm. You still have a cabin up in Mount Hood, right? Mm. Why not get out of the game? No way this is still fun. And is that why you do it, Miles? For the laughs? Look, your girl Dex is in over her head. These are heavy people. Alright. I'll pass that on. But, listen ‐‐ Carol... think about that cabin, alright? Hello. I'm sorry. I couldn't speak freely. Listen, I am here to help your friend Dan. Will you help me do that? Why would I do that? Or I could turn your life upside down and...see what falls out? Not necessary. When Dan taught here, he was a different person. How so? Your colleagues said they loved him, said the students did, too. Some of them, maybe too much. One student in particular ‐‐ very attractive. I always wondered. If he violated school policy. Don't be naive. Okay. What are you doing here? I'm just trying to get ahead of things for Dan, but what was his, um, name ‐‐ the ‐‐ the ‐‐ the student that he got tangled up in? Her name. Dan wasn't out. He was trying so hard to pass. Not that it mattered to us, but it did to him, and this girl was all over him. She was beautiful. Do you remember her name? No. This is 15 years ago. Anything you remember could help. She played volleyball. She dropped out. Next semester, Dan was gone. I'm proud he embraced his story. It's not always easy being true. No, no, it's not. Uh, thank you. You did a great thing for the people of Oregon. You know the Internet stocks video pornography for free? Alright. I'm helping Dex on the case. Why? Uh, 'cause she asked me, and I owe her. For what? A bunch of stuff. Hey, look, which one of these girls do you think is the, um... you know, the best, um... The... The, uh... The hottest? It's a reductive term, but yes. Which one is the hottest, in your opinion? ‐ Number 9. ‐That's what I was thinking. It's Number 9 for sure. Yeah. Alright, I got to tell Dex that. Yeah, I think you cracked this thing wide open. Good job. Thanks. Can I be honest? I kinda love this. Rooting around in people's past, pulling the thread. It's fun. Did you Google‐stalk me? After we met? No. So, you found it? Found what? How I wound up in Portland. How my ex had a psychotic break on vacation in France, said I used him as a drug mule. Heroin, he said. Police detained me. The State Department had to get me out in the end. I was trapped for two months. Lost my job. I lost everything. Had to leave Seattle and just start over. I don't know if you're messing with me or not. Well, you're the super‐sleuth. Hey. Hey, Dex. Yeah, I think I got her. Blond hair, long legs. Wow. You're really painting a word picture, buddy. She plays volleyball her freshman and sophomore year, and then she just drops out. Okay. I'll take a run at her. What's her name? Her name? Yeah. Emma Lindstrom. Great. Thanks. Ah. Link. Gotcha. Okay. Lindstrom. Wow. That was easy. Looks like I'm driving to Yamhill. Hey. You must be Jacob. Yeah, that's me. I'm, uh, Dex...Guardstone. Uh, I'm a friend of your mom's from way back when. Thanks. Well, it's a party. I'm Casey, Emma's brother. I‐Is everything okay, Mom? Everything's fine, sweetie. Why don't you go get started on your homework? Okay. You kids keep it down in here. Nice to meet you, Miss Guardstone. Shall we go outside? Yeah. Sweet kid. Smart ass. Like I said. What is your business with my sister? Uh... I have questions... about Jacob. So do I. Who sent you? Well, what does it matter? I got sent. Um...I know about you and Dan Gibson. I know a lot, actually. I know that he gave you a B‐plus in Applied Econometrics, that you had a fling and then you dropped out of school and had his baby, Jacob. But you, uh, you never told him. Why is that? Don't ‐‐ Don't come in our house with this garbage. Look, there was no father on the birth certificate. That's a red flag to me. And I am not the one you need to worry about, okay? There are bad people that are gonna find Jacob. It's campaign season. This is very valuable information. You don't have to say anything. Casey, I got it. I was obsessed with Dan. I had a feeling he was hiding things. I guess I thought he was so smart. And he made me feel smart... but I had a boyfriend back home. I got pregnant, and...I lied. Told him Jacob was his. He split right after Jacob was born. He didn't deserve to be a father. It's only ever been us ‐‐ me, my brother, and my boy. You have to protect your family. I can respect that. What do you suggest we do? I think you tell him. Now, in your own words. I can't. They're gonna ruin my son's life. You don't have to do this. You can keep this a secret. That's what I'm ‐‐ I'm trying to tell you. I can't. And ‐‐ And ‐‐ And you can't, either. So, you're gonna ‐‐ you're gonna sell this? You're gonna profit off our family? I am going to fulfill my job. Yeah. Good to know. Now get the hell out of our house. Yeah. Hey. I am so screwed. Yeah? Who isn't? No, I mean it. It's bad. It's bad. I messed up. Worse ‐‐ Worse than normal. Okay. What'd you do? Um...I found what my client was looking for. Oh, quit bragging. No, I mean it. This is really bad, Grey, okay? I‐I‐I found her, the ‐‐ the girl, and I don't know what to do with what I found. Well, for $45,000, you turn her in to the client, alright? I know. I know. I know. But if I do that, then I blow up her life, and...you know, that's not why I do this. Okay. Why did you start doing this? To help people, I think. Which is great. Dex, I can't give you an opinion unless you let me know what's going on. What's up? Well ‐‐ Hey. Hey. Hi. Hey. Hey. What do you say? We still on for tonight? Yeah. I just came back early to prep my station. That is really great. What were you saying? What's the thing? I'm not gonna...she's... No. It's okay. She knows about the girl. What? You told her? Why? 'Cause she helped me identify her. Oh, Number 9, with the legs. Okay, I'm a private investigator. "Private." You ‐‐ You can't just spill my work to the new bartender. Liz. My name is Liz. Liz. This is unbelievable. I don't even know why I came here. Okay, enough. Just let me help you. No, you know what? I'm good. Don't just say "I'm good." I'll just figure this out on my own, okay? Dex, come on. A rose? Come on, man, relax. It's for a lady. When was the last time you got somebody a flower, huh? It's nice. You should try it. You want a flower? Mm. What?! We need to talk. Hard pass. You don't even want to know the topic? Blow my mind. It involves you getting paid. Okay. So, here's the deal. I got the thing. Mm‐hmm? The October Surprise. So, what I'm thinking is, you take it to Vanessa, split your fee with me. 75 grand, right down the middle. I see. So, the thing you found is bad, someone begged you not to use it, but you're gonna. Now you're trying to spread your bad juju around. 35. You take 40, I'll take 35. You're on your own, girlie. I'm out. Okay, how about I take 25, you get to keep 50 grand? You don't get it. I quit. Heard Vanessa bragging how she was gonna destroy Councilman Dan. I got too many bodies on my belt. You know what kinda cases I like? Reuniting kids with their biological parents. That's my bag from here on out. Okay, so what do I do? The question you need to answer is, how much pain are you willing to inflict for a dollar? And I'd think fast, 'cause they got more people out there who'll do just about anything to scoop you. Who? You're in over your head. You should just lean on Detective Hoffman. He's watching out for you. You know what? I can watch my six just fine. Whatever you do, remember this ‐‐ you got to live with yourself. Yep. Thanks. Mm‐hmm. Anse? Are you okay? I am now. Did you get my text? Yeah, I did. What are you doing in my house? Oh, I'm fine, thank you. How are you? I wanted to deliver this in person. Troy? 45 grand? What is this for? It's your bonus for getting us what we needed. I haven't shown anyone my file. So, Casey Lindstrom, Emma's brother, he came to me because you proved to him that their little family secret was worth something. So, naturally, I bought it off him, and now I am paying you because he wouldn't have come forward otherwise. So, thank you. Wow. So, he sold out his own family? Okay, so what happens now? Now, I use what you found to go suck Councilman Dan into a black hole from which he'll never emerge. Oh, we go live at the county fair in ‐‐ oh, in about an hour. So...you did good, Parios. Mm‐hmm. Look, don't do this, okay? Jacob is a really good kid, and if you do this to him, his life is gonna be ruined. That's sad. Well... ...cat's out of the barn. What's the matter? Um...well, I just destroyed two families, buddy. Listen, I have to go. Where? I'm gonna fix it. Are you okay? I'm okay, Dex. Okay. Lock the door after me, okay? You're really slicing those limes, huh? Yeah, they should float. That's right. Hey, um... I'm...I'm sorry, but...I think we should keep this professional. Employee, boss. Keep? Well, we wouldn't be keeping it professional, right? We would be changing it to professional. Technically. No, physically. Liz, w‐what happened? It was kind of last‐minute. You canceled, and you did it via text. I know. I'm sorry. Alright, you've already said that. This is where I would normally ask you, "Did I do something wrong?" But I know I didn't, so ‐‐ You didn't. I know. Look, pretend I'm dumb and catch me up. What's going on? It's just...watching you two together ‐‐ I don't want to get in between anything. You talking about me and Dex? We are just friends. You can trust me. I want to trust you, but I just met you. I've seen this movie before. My last boyfriend ‐‐ You are comparing me to the guy who cracked up? Yes, but he had this ex who was always hanging around, and in the end, he wound up with her again. I...I just need to protect myself. Well, I can say this ‐‐ you have not seen this movie before. 'Cause this movie went straight to DVD. In South Korea. It was terrible. I'm backing out of the metaphor. Hey, can I put this knife down? Yes. Look, I really like you. I think you're great, okay? And I'm right here, and I'd like to give this a shot. And, look, me and Dex ‐‐ we're just friends. Give me a minute to prove that to you, okay? Okay. Yeah. I'm holding you to it. Okay. Llewellyn Slocombe  remember that. Llewellyn ‐‐ Hey. How you doing? Hi, sweetie. Good. Sir, don't get up. But get my vote, alright? Alright. Nice to see you. A vote for Slocombe is a vote for income! Slocombe! Hey. How you doing? Vote, okay? Hey. Wow. You're voting, right? Okay. Llewellyn Slocombe, everybody. Yes. Thank you. Every vote counts! Uh, Councilman...Dan? Um...you don't know me from Eve, but ‐‐ Uh... Dex Gladstone, right? Uh, rescued my fundraiser. I owe you. Um...uh, we don't have a lot of time, but, uh, I'm not who I said I was, and I have some sensitive i‐information that I need to share with you. Uh...Team Dan, c‐could we have the room? ‐Oh, alright. ‐Thanks. What's up? Um...so, you have a son. Uh, his mother is Emma Lindstrom. His name's Jacob. He's, uh, 15 years old. He's very funny. Uh, he's in AP Lit. Uh. I‐I tracked him down for your opponent. W‐What? Y... You were investigating me? I was. I was. And Slocombe's team is planning on going live with this right now. Then what the hell are you doing here? I took a job I shouldn't have taken, okay? I thought that both sides were dirty, so what did it matter what side I was on? But I was wrong. It does matter, and ‐‐ and I'm ‐‐ I'm here. I'm trying ‐‐ I'm trying to fix this. Okay, does... Oh, my God. Does the boy know about me? No. No, Emma never told him. Okay. Uh...S‐Slocombe speaks first. We've got, like, 15 minutes to strategize here. Wait, you have a son? Your whole coalition is based on the fact that you were an out gay man, that you were honest about who you are. They're behind me because I have a vision for the future, Ant. I ‐‐ Dan, our slogan is "Be You, Be True." This changes the story we've been telling, and the story is everything. Okay, sorry, this kid, your son ‐‐ he ‐‐ he didn't ask to be in the middle of this story. What do I do now? Wha‐‐ I guess you own it, okay? No spin. We expand your truth. Okay, well, that might work for you, but it's still gonna mess up Jacob's life. You're taking counsel from a turncoat PI? I ‐‐ You don't know that. Just... Oh, my God. Okay, look. This ‐‐ This side, they're gonna burn you, okay? They don't care what happens to you or to Jacob or his mother. What have I done? You didn't do anything. Dan, Emma made her choice, and now you have to make yours. What are we supposed to do? This is gonna ruin everything. All the work we've done ‐‐ Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I have a plan. But you're not gonna like it. Alright, people are coming off of funnel cakes, so let's talk fast. Someone want to tell me what the holy hell is going on here? We all know you're about to detonate Dan's family secret. Okay, they would have done the same to us. Actually, honey, we ran a clean campaign. We stand for something. Ooh. Keep talking. I'm getting aroused. That's disgusting. ‐Mm‐hmm. ‐You knock‐off Kellyanne Conway. Okay. Jacob Lindstrom is a 15‐year‐old kid who has no idea what's happening here, so what is it gonna take for you to keep him out of this? Ooh. Well, that's a big ask. Uh, there's only one thing that... I understand, and I am prepared. But we don't trust you. We want assurances. In writing. Mm‐hmm. ‐Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. ‐Mm‐hmm. Okay. Huh? I want to hear you say it first, though. I just ‐‐ I just want to hear it. I will drop out of the race. ‐ ‐Mm, mm. And you're gonna sign a contract that says that you and your team are not gonna utter Jacob's name. Not today, not ever. Great. Sure. Just draft it up. I already did. Okay. I hope you're proud of yourselves. Very. Let's take a little peek here. Mm. Alright. Thank you. I never pegged you to be a family man. ‐ ‐Whoa, Dan! I should have done that on the debate stage, you son of a bitch! I'm gonna ‐‐ You're gonna hear from my lawyer! And you know ‐‐ Hey! That was a good punch, though. ‐That was good. ‐Oh, wow. Let's go. Let's go. Let go of me! I know karate! Can we get a car? Good job. I'll come and get you! Let ‐‐ Let ‐‐ Let go of me! Excitement. Well, Dan was the better man. Oh, I've been at this since I was about knee‐high... at my daddy's mistress. We don't always deserve the better man, but you ‐‐ you. Wow. I am definitely keeping you in mind for future work. Oh, no. No. No, thank you. That would be ‐‐ That'd be horrible. Um, you can take this back. It's money. It's blood money. Is there any other kind? Yeah, there is. I will see you around the bouncy house. Mm‐hmm. Well, this is all that's left of Grandma's china. She threw a lot of it. Yeah. Do you remember when she broke, um, Uncle Mark's nose? Yeah. Hey, we're here! Hey. Ah. You brought the bartender to Friendsgiving. I did. We're together. And her name is Liz, and you know that. For example, Liz, would you explain the thing? Um, I have been aging a barrel of Sazerac. Wow. Well, by all means, come on in. Okay. Great. Mm‐hmm. Oh, Detective. Hey. Hey. Looks like you got the invite. Looks that way. So, I got the bottle you drink first and the bottle you drink second. Thank you. Hey, Ansel, this is Miles. Miles, Ansel. So, you can just invite anybody you want? Well, it is my house. Well, it's your parents' house. Do you want to eat or not? I do. Okay. You didn't let her cook anything, did you? No way. Alright. My doctor's traveling this week. I can't get sick. Rough day? Uh, it's just, you know ‐‐ No, go on and tell her. You're a hero. Um... I stopped the world from ruining one kid's life, but to do that, I had to bury a man who was gonna make the world a better place. You did the right thing. You know what I'm grateful for? Oh, yeah. Let's do that. Hey, that's for you. For things we couldn't predict. If I hadn't walked in to a decidedly not‐haunted bar on a job, I would have never met this guy. That's true. Cheers. ‐Cheers. ‐To you. Where's the restroom? Down the hall. Okay. ‐ ‐Whew. She is perfect, right? I don't know. Um...she seems really, like, happy. What? Is she okay?
