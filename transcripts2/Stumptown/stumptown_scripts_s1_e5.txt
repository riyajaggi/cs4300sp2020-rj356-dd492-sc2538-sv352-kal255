 Previously on "Stumptown"... I'm coming out of a long-term thing. What, like parole? - How long were you guys together? - Four years. But also, I really did do time. I need to get my 1,500 hours of apprenticeship so I can be certified here in Oregon. You're green, but you could be good, Dex. Why is Hoffman asking about you and a dead guy named Jack Feeney? Feeney was in prison with Grey McConnell.

 Guess who else was on his tier. Wallace Kane. Feeney ends up dead. A week later, Kane breaks out. I need a whiskey... and a good chiropractor. Kane is planning something here in Portland. He's got some unfinished business. - How do you know this? - Because I'm in his head! Do you remember that trip to Hawaii that you wouldn't shut up about? Take it. I put Wallace Kane away. If I was under his thumb, I'd be afraid. Aah! [GRUNTING]

 You owe me a half a million dollars. [AIR HORN BLOWS] [SPORTS ANNOUNCER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [WHISTLE BLOWS] Don't say it. - You look funny. - [CHUCKLES] Finish your Pop-Tarts, okay? Blueberry is better. Well, pumpkin was on sale. Why are you dressed like that? I'm trying to look professional. I have a very important meeting today. With who? Uh, Janet Withers, um, from the DPSST, the Department of Public something or something, whatever. So you can be a P.I.? Yeah. Yeah. If I get my certification, that means blueberry Pop-Tarts all day, any day. - Okay, can you turn this off? - [VIDEO GAME BEEPS, CONTROLLER CLATTERS] I'm gonna drop you off at the bar. Did you try Grey to let him know we're on our way? - He didn't pick up. - Okay. Well, he's probably busy. He always picks up. We'll try him on the way, all right? Come on. So, we got to break into the vault and then bust into the safe? That's a two-day job. Right, Grey? How should I know? I haven't even seen the thing. I'm not going back to prison for Kane. Will you guys help me if I pump the brakes here? Hell, yeah. This is nuts. Come on, Grey. Back us up on this thing. Come on. Both of you guys chill. Look, you know I got no beef with you, but I'm looking out for myself. Gentlemen... we're in business. 10 years ago, I started a beautiful tunnel. Amazingly, it's still intact. So, basically, we are on the 5-yard line. We will be in Las Vegas by midnight, at which point in time, I will be in libertine mode. [JACKHAMMER RATTLES IN DISTANCE] What? The boys and I have been talking. I love where this is headed. Why're we rushing this thing? Ugh! [GRUNTING] [HANK COUGHS, GROANS] Good question. The reason we're rushing is because I'm an escaped convict, and it's not really in my best interest to spend too much time in any one location. I mean, I would love to just chill here in Portland for a few weeks, hit up some microbreweries, but that's just not in the cards. So, anyone else have anything to share with the group? Comments? Concerns? Greyson? Are you done shaking your ass, man? 'Cause apparently, I got a job to do, and I'd like to do it. I'm sick of watching this. He's the only one I let talk to me like that. I don't know why. ♪ Move your ass. [SIREN WAILS] [LOCK DISENGAGES] Grey. Grey. Grey, are you here? Well, he probably overslept. Let me call him. - [CELLPHONE CHIMES] - Oh, look, I have a voicemail from him. You never check your messages. GREY: Dex, I hate to lay this on you, but I had an emergency. M-My aunt in Houston is really sick. I had to catch a flight last minute. Look, can you watch the bar until I get back? A few days, tops. Your brother will show you what to do. - Please. I owe you. - [SIGHS] Aunt? What aunt? He has a... He has a cousin in Tacoma, an uncle in, um... in Connecticut, but I've never heard of an aunt in Houston. We open in an hour. "We"? Buddy, I have an interview to go to, okay? I need help. Yeah. Okay. Uh, maybe Janet Withers can come here. Right? So, what should we do first? - Work. - Work. Okay. Stools? Yes. [METAL SCRAPING] [METAL THUDS] ♪ [GRUNTS] In case I neglected to mention, it's good to see you. I mean, you could have called first. [CHUCKLES] Next time. Oh, there's not gonna be a next time. That's what I'm saying. As soon as I crack this safe, I'm done. Fair enough. Though, I do find it strange you're about to break into a vault and you don't even ask what's in it. 'Cause I don't care what's in it. I do. That's why I only hire the best guys for the job. That is every single toy you asked for. [DIALING] [CELLPHONE BEEPS] ♪ [LINE RINGING] [CLICK] So far, so good with us. You? Yeah. I'm here. Grey gives you any trouble, just let me know. All right.

Cosgrove finds out you are not in Hawaii and that I knew, I could lose my job. - Your secret's safe with me. - Yeah. What's the latest on Kane? [SIGHS] Marshals are convinced that he's in Canada. They're coordinating efforts with the CSIS and the RCMP. - That doesn't add up. - I know. He has no money, no resources. All of his connections are here in Portland. - [SIGHS] - What about McConnell? Yeah, he wasn't at the bar. Some lady was running the place. I've seen her at the station. - Dax? - Dex? - Yeah. - Did you talk to her? I got my own work to do, Miles. I'm not even supposed to be here. Neither are you. ♪ [LINE RINGS] [CELLPHONE BEEPS] Grey never turns his phone off. Something's up. It's from Edgar. - Who's Edgar? - The chef. - He quit? - He quit.

Yes, it's a newspaper. What about him? I heard he might be sniffing around here, looking to do a review. You're blowing up, dude. [CHUCKLES] I've outgrown this place. - Don't say it. - I'm saying it. How can I spread my wings when I can barely fit inside this fishbowl? [INHALES SHARPLY] That's two things, but you get my meaning. [CELLPHONE VIBRATES, RINGS] What's up, Dex? MAN: [RAPPING IN SPANISH] ♪ [EXHALES SHARPLY] Oh, Took. - Oh. Bless you. - TOOKIE: [CHUCKLES] What is all this? Welcome to the magic show. That doesn't answer anything. These are the ingredients that are gonna take me from a taco truck to my own restaurant [SNIFFS] To the cover of Food & Wine mag. Okay. That's great. I just...

I mean, how many of these have we done together, man? Five? Six? Since when did you get the shakes? When I had a kid. - You had a kid? - A girl. Kami. - 6 months. - [LAUGHS] Wow, man. Congrats.

I'm here for your certification interview. - Yes. Hi. Sorry. - Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming down. Um, why don't we grab a seat over there? - Okay. - Great. Can I get a water, please? Yeah, absolutely. Um... - [TAP HISSING] - Okay. Come on. Buddy, you got to take over, okay? It's not working. It's not coming out. - It's... - [TAP SPUTTERS] You did your apprentice hours under Arthur Banks? Yes. Yep. What would you say are the top three things you learned from Arthur? Honor. Mm-hmm.

Have you ever been convicted of a felony? - No. - Do you associate with anyone who's been convicted of a felony? No. Why do you want to be a private investigator? What? It's a simple question. Surely you've thought about it. Yeah. Of... Of course I have. Um, uh, deeply, I've considered it. Um... I just, uh... I really like helping people? - Is that a question? - Um... 'Cause when you're parked outside a cheap motel on the interstate six hours into an all-night stakeout, your bladder's about to explode, your pee bottle's full, and you're fresh out of adult diapers, your car smells like the five-day-old chalupa you lost under your seat, your last client stiffed you, and you don't know where the next one's coming from, I can assure you, you will be asking yourself the same question... "Why the hell would I want to be a private investigator?" [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Uh... I know I'm supposed to have a good answer, but I don't. Um... The truth is, I, um... I drink a little bit too much sometimes. Um, my best friend is a felon, and I haven't been able to hold down a real job in about 10 years. But this? This, I'm... I'm good at. I-I-I don't know why, but I... but I am. And you seem pretty cynical about the whole thing, and maybe one day, I will be, too, but, um [SIGHS] From where I'm sitting right now, that chalupa is smelling pretty damn good.

Yeah, I put a bullet in his head, but you served him up, Detective. You want to kill me? You go right ahead. But it ain't ever gonna make you feel any better. I'm willing to find out.

"Chef Navarro's cuisine was, in our foodie-saturated age, that rarest of things... entirely unexpected." - Mm. - "Even the limited beverage program and indifferent service added a certain rough-hewn charm." That was your department. Mm. "But a win for our fine diners is a loss for our streets. We all feel Portland getting less weird by the day. If Chef Navarro's plans are for a brick-and-mortar restaurant, losing his iconic truck is sadly just a sign of the times." Portland needs me. There shall be no restaurant.
