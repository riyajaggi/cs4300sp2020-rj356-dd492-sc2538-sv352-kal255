 Argh! Amy? Amy? Dad? - Have you seen Shun? - What? - He's taken the car somewhere. Well, he's not in my room, obviously. - I'm going to tell your mother about my suicide... - Yeah. - .. attempt. Erm... I'm planning on taking her away for the evening and I want to do it like that. Do you think that's a good idea? - Yeah, probably. - She's very angry with me. Maurice! I am waiting to have this talk! Thanks for your help.

 Yep, just coming! I think it's a fucking terrible idea. It's a really nice hotel. We can relax and then... we can talk. Why can't we just talk here? I really feel like we could do with getting out of here for the evening. Get some space. Have a conversation. About what? I thought I was difficult to talk to. Er... about, well, us and... me. And me. Yes. About you, yeah. - I don't think this is working. - Pardon? - I don't think this is working. - Right, yeah. I think it would've sort of been easier to cope with

 if it was just that you were gay. Yeah, sorry. I mean, is Shun even back with the car? Cos I'm not spending hundreds of pounds on a taxi. No, but I'm sorting it. Erm... that reminds me, actually, I should probably tell you, there was one time when Shun did sort of try to give me a hand job. But I'm almost a 100% certain that he just misunderstood what I was asking for, so in the spirit of honesty... Er... Good morning! Thank goodness she's not some smelly boyfriend. This is much better. Is it too much, do you think? No, I like the harmonies. Maybe just one step at a time. Don't want to be like your dad was. "Stop writing me things, you mad bastard!" I get it. Means he liked you, at least. Yeah. What I wouldn't give to be you, right now. This is the best bit. Just before it all happens. And then slowly it all just... disappears. So make sure you enjoy it. I've got to get your dad in the fucking car now. Have a nice time. The Albatross. I'm trying to build the world's first flying car. She's a beaut, ain't she, Dad? Does it still drive? - D'you mean on the ground? - Mmm. - On the ground, yeah. Do the wings... come off easily? Not really, no. I boosted the joins with my best super goo. - D'you ever think about finding a different hobby? - Calling. I mean, obviously, if you did invent a flying car, that would fantastic. But erm, it's an extremely hard thing to achieve. Hmm. Donald, can I ask you a favour? Can you keep an eye on your sister while I'm away? I think she's in a bit of a strange way again. I'm... I'm just asking for your help. - Do you want me to wipe her arse as well, then? - Um, no. D'you not know what a rhetorical question is? I thought you were an author. Oh, wait... you're not. Because you were fired! Twat! OK, what about if Billy and Bella Grubb are make competition for building skyscraper? - But Mrs Grubb get very angry because much too tall. - You're embarrassing yourself. Shun, every other illustrator that's worked with Maurice has quit because he's so difficult. He's moody, he's inconsistent and he's stubborn. There are loads of other projects you could work on. Why are you so determined to save Grubbs? OK, maybe a little bit different angle. Grubbs family making friends with very small mouse. Sneaky one. Very naughty boy! Scootchy-koochie-koochie-koo! Naughty one. What's he doing? Naughty little mouse! Abigail, come in. - You look lovely. - Oh, thank you. - Yes, Maurice and I have suddenly decided we're heading out for the day, so... - Oh, that's nice. Hmm. I'm so proud of you both. Feel free to do whatever you like up there. We're very relaxed. Erm... You don't happen to have any friends suitable for Donald, do you? - Not... suitable for Donald, no. - OK. Where's my beautiful gay daughter? I think she's about to have one of her seven daily shits. Mid-morning sesh takes her good half hour. I just think you should know this kind of... detail, before you make your final decision. Shame you didn't plump for yours truly. I'm more experienced, of course. I've already had one and a half girlfriends. The only relationship Amy's ever had is with a frog. Why are you moving away? Lots of reasons really, but mainly to do with my dad and his job and... I guess he's a bit over-protective. Are you dumping me? We have only been on one date. Does he think I'm not good enough for you? That's me two years ago. Look, my dad and I have spent a lot of time working out a better regime for me... keeping up with my kundalini and gazing, some anal breathing. And I'm sort of worried that if I mess with it, I might relapse. I need something a little quieter. And Donald said this would be kind of like your first time and it's... just a little intense for me. 'I'll get more work elsewhere.' We're making the right decision. I think I can forgive you. And I'm sorry for hurting your feelings. And I'm sorry for calling you a fat pig-slut maniac with no moral compass... and for smashing up the house and forfeiting our deposit. I was scared, Abigail, about losing you. And for your sake... that you might fall from such exquisite grace. - Fucking Donald! - Why is this making such a ridiculous noise? I think it might be running out of petrol. I can't see the fuel gauge cos he's stuck an altimeter on it. I'll find somewhere to fill up. Fuck this family! Fuck this house! Hey! Stop it! What are you doing! - What did you say to her? - I just told her the truth. It's not my fault if she doesn't like you enough, is it? - What is that? - You don't see me crying. I loved her as well. What does it even fucking do? It's a toilet brush! - I don't know yet! - Fucking waste of life. NOTHING! You and dad are both exactly the same... moping about in your pants like you're superior to everyone. Well, you're not. I hate you and I fucking hate Dad! You're both selfish, arrogant, pretentious mard-arses. - IT'S PATHETIC! - Dad tried to hang himself, you IDIOT! Ye... We... GOOD! Oh, that's probably why he didn't tell you. Why don't you just fuck off and leave then, instead of talking about it the whole time? - Fine, I will. - Go on, then. - I'm going. - Good. Bitch! I love sweating... don't you? All the toxins and the negativity just pouring out. Getting pure again. Mmm-hmm. It's, er, really nice. Ooh! Is it safe that hot? You smell absolutely incredible. Do I? I'm boiling. It's fantastic. Beads of you are evaporating into the air and flying up my nose. I'm in a cloud of Abigail. I think we might have to engage - in some psycho-spiritual conflict resolution. - Ooh! Mmm! Fuck off, pot! - I love you. - I love you, too. Abigail! I know you love me. Abigail! Oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh! - Aaarrrggghhh! - Argh! You want us to be friends because you're going out with your dad? Except he's not my dad. - We're passionate lovers. - We've been having a bit of a rocky patch, but we've worked through it now. Why do you have to pretend to be her dad? I need to have the freedom to maximise my client base. Part of the sale is my sexual magnetism. It's just a stupid excuse so that he can shag other women. No, no. It's not. Abigail, she's foxing you. Be strong. - Can you not see that he's an idiot? - Quiet, lago! Look, Amy. Sometimes I get confused. - Yes. That's right. - Or I don't have a strong sense of who I am. - Exactly. - So I try and fill the void in myself with someone else. And even though you did make me feel... .. complete, that's not the same as being in love. Isn't it? Show's over, little lesbian. I'm her sexual destiny. Not you. Fucking hell. Can I ask, is this really a Scotch egg? Because its shape is, sort of, well, not like an egg. Well... it's a Scotch egg-ish. Right, so it's a, sort of, meat and egg powder? Yeah. Right, thanks, and 20 Fishermen's, please. Right. Here you go. Deborah! Deborah! Deborah! Deborah, I bought you tea! I got you a cup of tea, Deborah! Here we go. OK, back on track. Scotch egg? Fair enough. Save yourself for a nice meal. Can you just... hold this? Thanks. Let's get to this... Oh, sorry. .. beautiful hotel. How can I help you to stop being so sad? I'm just having a bit of a dark period. OK, well, how long will this dark period last? Because it's getting, frankly, quite boring. I know, I'm trying. Well, whatever you're doing, it's not working, is it? So we need to find something else, maybe go and see a doctor, perhaps. I can't... I can't really explain it. Could you try? Because if I don't know what's going on with you, I can't help. And I love you, Maurice... .. but I used to be quite a happy person before I met you. It's like... It's like an invisible monster with no shape, no form, but it's loud and fierce and it never ends. Right, OK. I mean, is that... Is that the clearest way you can think of to explain it? I'm trying, I'm sorry. No, right, it's OK. So how do we defeat this monster? - We can't. - There must be some way. All monsters have a weakness. Maybe it's love. Maybe love is how we defeat this monster together. Love makes it worse. Actually, erm... Do you mind if I have a quick cigarette? I... Sorry, I just feel a bit... Obviously, I want to carry on, but... Sorry, I'll just be a second. Shun, we've been talking for eight hours. OK, one more thing. One second. Please. What is this? This is my village. My favourite image for remember my house before big earthquake is coming. My little sister... "Do-do-do!" .. run along very happy. I am on the train to karaoke festival in Yokohama and suddenly I hear a big earthquake. Thinking, "Oh, such a shame!" Then discover my village is place for earthquake. Oh, my God. Turn around. Run fast as I can. Searching, searching. Under this rock, maybe under this rock. "Excuse me, where is my family?!" Can't find anywhere. And finally I'm looking in a little hole and I see... Ah, this is my little sister Aiko Chan... .. but half squash and so I discover my whole family completely squash. So never mind. Get little apartment in town and I'm very miserable, of course... nothing left. No money, just tiny bread for eating. And for keep warm, I'm go to book shop and discover, "What is this little strange book?" Funny picture. Have a look. It's Japanese version of Grubb. And reading very strange story, Acorn Conundrum, Swamp Dragon, Fungus Brain. Who is this person writing this book? It's Mr Flowers. I think, "Ah, Mr Flowers! "You are know how I am feeling", because I need to see that miserable is happen, you know? Difficulties happen, this is world. You can survive. Grubb always survive. So I'm write Mr Flowers letter, probably terrible English. I come to England and I'm illustrator for you. Mr Flowers save my life. This is why I want to save Grubb. I'm sorry, it's still a no. Please. In Japan, if this kind of situation, normally say, "Yes." - Well, we're not in Japan. - Yes, I know not Japan, Mr Carroll. Everybody eat so much butter ... drive me completely mad! Thank you for your time. Very kind you are. Arigatou gozaimasu "I got the idea for this invention "because my sister sometimes gets very sad "and I wanted to invent something to make her more happy." "I'm always happy, so I created the Happiness Machine to take "the happiness from my head and put it into Amy's." Amy! Why is your hand bleeding?! - I'm trying to learn how to ride a bike. - What?! Why? - I'm sorry. - Help me, then. - What do you want me to do? - Give me a push. - OK? - Yeah. - I need a proper push! - I gave you a proper push. Look... - Ready? - Yeah. OK, let go, let go! "A thousand years upon this land. "The maiden blood of your frail hand "has mingled with these twisted roots. "My mangled trees of crooked youth. "And though we are an age apart, "Penelope, we share a heart. "You galloped through this heathen wood, "the hallowed path to womanhood. "And though the angry tribe gave chase, "they couldn't match your savage pace. "They cowered at your fearsome howl "as you escaped this forest foul. "Across the ancient holy bridge "to claim your earthy privilege. "And though I am a dismal freak, it doesn't mean that I am weak. "It doesn't mean I can't be free "as you, my brave Penelope." Go on, Amy! Keep going! Amy!
