STERNWORTHY, WPIG NEWS, CINCINNATI'S NUMBER ONE RADIO STATION. SINCE YOU'RE ON THE ROAD, AS WE SAY IN THE TRADE, MOST OF THE YEAR, DOESN'T THAT PUT A CRIMP IN YOUR LOVE LIFE? YES, IT DOES. BUT WE'RE ALL LIKE ONE BIG FAMILY, SO WE REALLY DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH TIME FOR OUTSIDE INTERESTS. SO THEN WE CAN SAFELY SAY... I HAVE A QUESTION, BUT I'LL ASK LATER. THAT THERE IS NO TRUTH TO THE RUMOR THAT YOU ARE ROMANTICALLY LINKED... WITH THE JUNIOR SENATOR FROM A MAJOR MIDWESTERN STATE? YES, YOU CAN SAFELY SAY THAT. SAYS YOU. LES NESSMAN! LES NESSMAN, WINNER OF THE BUCKEYE NEWSHAWK AWARD. MISS TAYLOR, UH, ONE MOMENT, PLEASE. I SEEM TO HAVE MISPLACED MY QUESTION. UM, IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION, AND I'M SURE YOUR RESPONSE WILL BE...

HOWARD R. STERNWORTHY, WPIG AGAIN. MISS TAYLOR, THE RECORD INDUSTRY HAS COME INCREASINGLY UNDER SURVEILLANCE... OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, AND NOT A FEW HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY...
