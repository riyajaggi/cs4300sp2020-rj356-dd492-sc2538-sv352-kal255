OH. - YOU DON'T REMEMBER CALLING THIS MEETING? GET OUT OF THAT CHAIR, JUGHEAD. SURE. REASON I'M LATE IS BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A LITTLE PROBLEM AT HOME. OUR MAID SEEMS TO THINK HER MIND IS BEING CONTROLLED BY WALLY SCHIRRA. THE ASTRONAUT? YEAH. THIS MORNING HE TOLD HER... TO LAY IN CANNED WATER AND DEHYDRATED FRUIT. - HOW LONG'S THAT BEEN GOING ON? - AH, ABOUT SIX YEARS. EXCUSE ME. I KNOW WE'VE ALL GOT OUR LITTLE PROBLEMS AT HOME, BUT COULD WE GET TO THE SUBJECT OF THE MEETING. OKAY. HERB, I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LET YOU GO. - WH... WHY? - WELL, FOR TWO REASONS. REASON NUMBER ONE IS YOU'RE THE SALES MANAGER. REASON NUMBER TWO... THERE ARE NO SALES. THERE'S GOT TO BE A CONNECTION THERE. WELL, THAT'S NOT MY FAULT! IT'S HIS FAULT. ANDY CHANGED THE FORMAT. - GOOD POINT. WHAT ABOUT THAT, TRAVIS? - WELL, NOW WAIT A MINUTE. I TOLD YOU THERE'D BE SOME LEAN MONTHS IN THE BEGINNING. LEAN? HERE'S A LIST OF CLIENTS WE'VE LOST SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE. HEY, LET ME SEE THAT LIST. SHADY HILLS REST HOME GONE. SINCERITY SAVINGS AND LOAN GONE. ROLLING THUNDER EUROPEAN REGULARITY TONIC'S GONE. I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. WELL, IT'S SOMETHING THAT OLD PEOPLE TAKE... I MEAN THE CLIENT LIST. OH. TALK TO HIM. LOOK. SIR, WE WILL GET NEW CLIENTS. - I PROMISE YOU THAT. - WHEN? WELL, RIGHT NOW, IF YOU'D LET ME ADVERTISE THE FORMAT CHANGE. BUT THAT TAKES MONEY, AND YOU WON'T GIVE ME ANY. EXACTLY. NOW WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT IN MIND? I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS SOME SORT OF PUBLICITY STUNT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. - A FREE ONE? - WELL, IT'S GOT TO BE. RIGHT? I LIKE THAT. LET'S HAVE A PUBLICITY STUNT. BELIEVE ME, SIR, THAT IS NOT AS EASY AS IT MIGHT SOUND. HEY, ANDY, IF IT WAS EASY, THE BIG GUY WOULD DO IT. AM I RIGHT, SIR? LIKE HERE'S WHAT WE NEED... WE NEED A BIG IDEA. SOMETHIN' THAT'S GONNA MAKE THE NEWSPAPERS. WHAT DO YOU THINK, JOHNNY? - HEY, JOHNNY. - YES? GOT ANY IDEAS? NO. I TRY NOT TO HAVE ANY IDEAS. THEY ONLY LEAD TO COMPLICATIONS. I TELL YOU, YOU ARE A BIG HELP. SUPPOSE I GIVE YOU A GREAT IDEA. LET'S SUPPOSE THAT THIS GREAT IDEA WORKS... AND THE STATION STARTS MAKING A LOT OF MONEY. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT CAN LEAD TO, ANDY? MEMOS. AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, ASSIGNED PARKING SPACES. THEN, CHROME FURNITURE. LOTS OF PAINTINGS... OF WISTFUL CHILDREN WITH BIG EYES. BELIEVE ME, I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN BEFORE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. LISTEN, DON'T GET ALL SHOOK UP. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HELP. BUT DON'T YOU SEE? NO ONE SHOULD. SO, WHAT'S HAPPENIN', WHITE FOLKS? YOU A LITTLE EARLY THIS MORNING, AREN'T YOU, VENUS? YEAH. I HAD TO COME DOWNTOWN, HAVE MY SUIT WORKED ON. IT'S ITALIAN. WELL, I GUESS AN OUTFIT LIKE THAT'S IN THE SHOP MOST OF THE TIME, HUH? I GOT SUITS I CAN'T EVEN GET PARTS FOR. EXCUSE ME. ANDY, UH, AM I INTERRUPTING ANYTHING IMPORTANT? - UH, BELIEVE ME, IT'S NOTHING IMPORTANT. - WELL, ANDY, I, UH... I SORT OF HAD AN IDEA. IT'S, UH, PRETTY BAD, I BET. PROBABLY SOMETHING WE SHOULDN'T DO. BAILEY. BUT I READ ABOUT IT SOMEWHERE... BAILEY. YES? WHAT'S THE IDEA? WELL, THERE'S A STATION IN ATLANTA THAT SPONSORS A RAFT RACE. MAYBE WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OH, WELL, ACTUALLY, THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD IDEA. EXCEPT I'M AFRAID THE OHIO RIVER RUNS A LITTLE FAST. PEOPLE COULD GET KILLED. NOBODY SAID IT WAS GONNA BE EASY. - NEXT PROBLEM. - JOHNNY, PLEASE. OKAY. I GOT A PERFECT IDEA. THE WAY I SEE IT, WE START WITH, UH, BAILEY AND JENNIFER, A SIZABLE CROWD, A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NUDITY. HEAR! HEAR! - JOHNNY, SIT DOWN. - THANK YOU. EXCUSE ME. I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT, BUT I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT MY NEWS PROGRAM. - OH, SURE, LES. - YOU KNOW, WE COULD BLOW THE STATION UP. THAT WOULD GRAB THE HEADLINES. OR WE COULD JUST BURN IT DOWN. I LIKE THE NUDITY IDEA BETTER. PERHAPS I COULD COME BACK LATER. - SOMEBODY KNOCK? - IT'S LES NESSMAN, MR. CARLSON. - WHAT DO YOU WANT? - MAY I COME IN? OKAY. MR. CARLSON, I MUST SPEAK TO YOU ON A VERY URGENT MATTER. - OH, NO. - I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY... THAT AS NEWS DIRECTOR OF THIS STATION, I KEEP MY EAR TO THE GROUND. WELL, I'M GLAD TO HAVE HEARD THAT, LES. THANKS FOR DROPPING BY. SO AS A RESPONSIBLE JOURNALIST, I NEVER JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. THAT'S MY STYLE. THAT... THAT'S JUST THE WAY I AM. LES, COULD WE KIND OF STEP THIS UP A LITTLE, HMM? MR. CARLSON, I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT A PLOT IS BEING PERPETRATED... BY A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF EMPLOYEES HERE... WHOSE INTENTION IS TO BURN DOWN OR BLOW UP THIS STATION. WHAT? AT THE VERY LEAST, I BELIEVE THIS GROUP PLANS TO COME TO WORK NAKED. GOOD LORD. THAT'S WHAT I SAID. LOOK, LES. I-I KNOW YOU GOT A GREAT NOSE FOR NEWS, BUT, UH, YOU'RE ALSO A LITTLE CONSPIRACY-MINDED, NOW AREN'T YA, HUH? I WOULDN'T SAY SO. COME ON, LES. REMEMBER THE WAY YOU BROADCAST BING CROSBY'S DEATH? "FIRST PRESLEY, NOW CROSBY. JUST A COINCIDENCE? I WONDER." BUT THIS TIME SOMETHING STRANGE IS GOING ON. I CAN JUST FEEL IT. LOOK, LES. NOTHING STRANGE IS GOING ON. BELIEVE ME. HELLO. UH-HUH. BUTTER AND CHEESE. MM-HMM. NO, WALLY SCHIRRA IS INNOCENT. OH, AND OLIVES. UH-HUH. YEAH. THANKS. BYE. - NOW WHERE WERE WE? - WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION. I GOTTA SEE THE BIG GUY RIGHT AWAY. HERB, SOMETHING STRANGE IS GOING ON HERE. I CAN JUST FEEL IT. GOOD FOR YOU, LES. HOW ABOUT EXCUSING US? YES, OF COURSE. I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO DO. YOU KNOW, I'M AFRAID LES IS HEADING FOR A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN. TOUGH BREAK. BIG GUY, I GOT SOME BAD NEWS FOR YOU. AW, COME ON. WE JUST LOST THE BO PEEP SAFETY SHOE ACCOUNT. I, UH, DIDN'T WANT YOU TO HEAR IT FROM A STRANGER. MR. CARLSON, THERE'S A MR. WAYNE R. COE HERE TO SEE YOU. OH, YEAH, FINE. SEND HIM AWAY. ALL RIGHT. I'LL TELL HIM YOU'RE DEAD. GOLLY. ISN'T SHE GOOD? OH, JENNIFER. JUST A MINUTE. UH, THIS GUY MIGHT BE A NEW CUSTOMER. IS THAT LIKELY? I THINK WE OUGHT TO SEE HIM. ALL RIGHT, FINE. EH, SEND HIM IN. I'LL DO MOST OF THE TALKING. MR. CARLSON? M-MAYBE. UH... WHAT'S THE NATURE OF YOUR BUSINESS? I REPRESENT A GROUP OF YOUR FORMER LISTENERS, DEVOTED FANS OF THE KIND OF MUSIC YOU USED TO PLAY, HATERS OF ROCK AND ROLL. WE'RE A SMALL BUNCH ADMITTEDLY, BUT WE'RE A DETERMINED FRINGE ELEMENT... THAT CANNOT BE COUNTED UPON TO DO THE SENSIBLE THING. I SEE. I DON'T THINK THIS GUY'S A CUSTOMER. FURTHERMORE, MY GROUP HAS PETITIONED THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION... TO HAVE YOUR LICENSE REVOKED UNLESS YOU IMMEDIATELY RETURN TO YOUR PREVIOUS FORMAT... AND APOLOGIZE LIVE ON THE AIR TO LAWRENCE WELK. MR. COE, MR. CARLSON'S DEAD. SOMETHING HEAVY FELL ON HIM. UH... PIANO. A PIANO, WE THINK. WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE DETAILS. WELL, I'M NOT BUYING THAT. OH, YOU'RE NOT... UH... UH... OKAY. YOU WIN. HE'S CARLSON. MR. CARLSON, FAILING GOVERNMENT SUPPORT, MY GROUP GOES IMMEDIATELY TO PLAN "B." - WHAT'S THAT? - THAT'S A SECRET. - OH. - LET'S JUST SAY... WE PLAN TO BRING THIS STATION TO ITS KNEES. I'D LIKE TO SEE YA TRY IT. HERB! THOSE ARE FIGHTING WORDS, MR. CARLSON. WELL, I WILL NOT BE INTIMIDATED, PARTICULARLY BY THE LIKES OF YOU. - THIS IS WAR THEN. - UP YOUR NOSE, MR. COE. HERB!

HERE ARE YOUR TELEPHONE MESSAGES. OH, THANK YOU, JENNIFER. LISTEN, I'VE BEEN THINKING. IF I WERE GONNA PUT ANOTHER DOOR IN HERE, UH, WHERE WOULD YOU PUT IT? UH, PROBABLY OVER THERE. IT WOULD LEAD OUT INTO THE HALL. AND THAT WAY, IF ANYTHING IMPORTANT CAME UP, YOU COULD LEAVE THROUGH THERE AND HIDE IN THE BACK. YOU KNOW, JENNIFER, YOU'RE A VERY SMART WOMAN.
