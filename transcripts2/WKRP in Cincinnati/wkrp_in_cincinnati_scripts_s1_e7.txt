SOME OF THEM TRIED TO ATTACK ME. I HAD TO JAM MYSELF INTO A PHONE BOOTH. THEN MR. CARLSON HAD THE HELICOPTER LAND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARKING LOT. I GUESS HE THOUGHT HE COULD SAVE THE DAY BY TURNING THE REST OF THE TURKEYS LOOSE. IT GETS PRETTY STRANGE AFTER THAT. NOW IT GETS STRANGE. YEAH, RIGHT. UH, LES, COME ON NOW. TELL US THE REST.
