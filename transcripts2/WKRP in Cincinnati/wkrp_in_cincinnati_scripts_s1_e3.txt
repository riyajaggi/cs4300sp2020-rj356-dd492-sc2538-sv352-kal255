LES AND A COUPLE REPORTERS WERE INTERVIEWING THIS BALLPLAYER AFTER THE GAME. NOW, LES DOESN'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT SPORTS. SO HE ASKS A COUPLE OF CRAZY QUESTIONS. WHEN HE SPLITS, ONE REPORTER TURNS TO THE OTHER AND SAYS, "QUEER LITTLE FELLOW, ISN'T HE?" AND THE BALLPLAYER MISUNDERSTOOD THE REMARK. - THEN IT'S ALL JUST A SILLY MISUNDERSTANDING. - RIGHT, BUT TELL LES THAT. I'LL TELL LES THAT. LES IS MY BEST FRIEND. I'LL GET HIM BACK IN HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME. THIS TIME IT'LL BE DIFFERENT. NO, I DON'T THINK SO. BUT I KNOW I COULD DO IT. "FAREWELL, A LONG FAREWELL TO ALL MY GREATNESS! "THIS IS THE STATE OF MAN: "TODAY HE PUTS FORTH THE TENDER LEAVES OF HOPES, "TOMORROW BLOSSOMS AND BEARS HIS BLUSHING HONORS THICK UPON HIM. "THE THIRD DAY COMES A FROST, A KILLING FROST.
