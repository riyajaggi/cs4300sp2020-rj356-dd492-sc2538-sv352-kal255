AND SPEAKING OF CONFUSING, WHAT ABOUT THAT NEW NIGHTTIME MAN, VENUS, UH, FLYPAPER? TRAP. FLYTRAP. IT'S THE HOUR OF DARKNESS, CHILDREN. AND VENUS IS ON THE RISE IN CINCINNATI. THE MOON IS HIGH. MRS. CARLSON, OUR NEW AUDIENCE UNDERSTANDS VENUS. HE COMMUNICATES WITH 'EM, JUST LIKE JOHNNY FEVER DOES. AH, FEVER. HOW'S THAT OLD REPROBATE DOING? HE LOVES IT HERE, MOTHER. I'LL BET HE DOES. THIS MUST BE THE ONLY STATION IN AMERICA THAT HAS YET TO FIRE HIM. HE'S A GOOD MAN, MOM! HE'S A MAN, ARTHUR, AS ARE ALL THE REST OF THE EMPLOYEES HERE. BESIDES JENNIFER, ARE THERE ANY OTHER WOMEN WORKING UP HERE? SURE. THERE'S BAILEY QUARTERS. SHE JUST RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM JOURNALISM SCHOOL. THAT'S RIGHT!

I MEAN... HERB IS A MARRIED MAN, MRS. CARLSON. AND I'M QUITE SURE HE LIKES JENNIFER ONLY, YOU KNOW, FOR A FRIEND. HE SHOULD PAY AS MUCH ATTENTION TO HIS JOB. WELL, HE DOES. ACTUALLY, I THINK HERB'S PROBABLY A PRETTY BRIGHT FELLA. OH, YEAH, MOM. HERB'S NOBODY'S FOOL. HERB... OUR RECEPTIONIST, THE BEAUTIFUL JENNIFER MARLOWE, IS A RESULT OF THE MOST CUNNINGLY SUCCESSFUL SEX-CHANGE OPERATION... IN MEDICAL HISTORY. - GET OUTTA HERE. - OKAY. WAIT A MINUTE.

ARTHUR, ARTHUR, ARTHUR, WHY DIDN'T YOU FIRE HERB YEARS AGO? MRS. CARLSON, FIRING HERB WOULDN'T SOLVE ANYTHING. I KNOW THAT, MR. TRAVIS. I THINK THE PROBLEM IS MUCH HIGHER UP THAN THAT. HOW... HOW HIGH? HIGH, ARTHUR. MRS. CARLSON, YOU CANNOT JUDGE A RADIO STATION... BY THE UNORTHODOX BEHAVIOR OF ITS EMPLOYEES. ALL RIGHT. LET'S TALK PROFITS INSTEAD. HOW DID OUR ADVERTISING CLIENTS REACT TO THE CHANGE IN FORMAT? UH, WELL, THEY... THEY ALL... LEFT. YEAH, BUT WE GOT SOME NEW CLIENTS. - FOR INSTANCE? - THE MIGHTY MELLOW CIGARETTE ROLLING PAPER ACCOUNT. AND THERE WAS WHAT ELSE? RED RED WIGGLERS. RED WIGGLERS. WHAT ARE RED WIGGLERS? UH, WELL, RED WIGGLER'S A BIG CONCERN, MOTHER. VERY BIG. - WHAT DO THEY SELL? - WORMS. - WONDERFUL. - I LIKE THEIR... I LIKE THEIR JINGLE. ♪ RED WIGGLERS THE CADILLAC OF WORMS ♪ WE'RE HOOKED. HEY, THE CONCERT. WE MADE MONEY ON THAT ROCK CONCERT. NOW THAT IS A FACT. WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE ORCHESTRA? GEE, I DON'T KNOW. LET'S SEE. WHAT WERE THEY CALLED? SCUM OF THE EARTH. SCUM OF THE EARTH? WELL, THEY WERE VERY BIG IN ENGLAND, MOTHER. SCUM... OF THE EARTH. THAT CONCERT WAS A BIG SUCCESS, MRS. CARLSON. WE MADE MONEY ON THAT CONCERT. REALLY? OH, YES, MA'AM. WE SURE DID. YEAH, AND THEN THE NEXT WEEK, WE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL REMOTE BROADCAST TOO. - I DON'T THINK YOUR MOTHER WANTS TO HEAR THAT ONE. - OH, NO. TELL ME ABOUT IT. OH. UH, UH, UH... GO AHEAD, ANDREW. WELL, IT WAS FROM A STEREO STORE, MRS. CARLSON. AND I'LL TELL YOU, OUR BROADCAST JUST PACKED IN THOSE CUSTOMERS. NOW, I'D LIKE TO TRY TO DESCRIBE SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE ACTION THAT'S HAPPENING DOWN HERE. A MAN WE BELIEVE MIGHT BE A CUSTOMER... HAS JUST COME BACK FROM FRESHENING UP. AND IT LOOKS AS THOUGH HE'S LEAVING. NO, HOLD IT. HE'S PAUSING THERE. MAYBE HE'S GONNA CHAT... WITH DEL MURDOCH, PERSONABLE OWNER OF DEL'S STEREO AND SOUND. YES, HE IS. MAYBE HE'S GONNA BUY SOMETHING. NO, NO, HE'S PULLED OUT A GUN. AND IF THERE'S A POLICEMAN WHO MIGHT BE LISTENING, APPARENTLY WE'RE BEING HELD UP DOWN HERE AT DEL'S STEREO AND SOUND. THAT'S AT 24675... NINE. IF MR. MURDOCH WERE STILL IN BUSINESS, HE'D TELL YOU WHAT A GOOD JOB WE DID FOR HIM. WHAT WAS THE BOTTOM LINE ON THAT REMOTE? - WE'D HAVE TO LOOK THAT ONE UP. - OKAY, LOOK IT UP. OKAY. OH, AND, YES, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, I'D LIKE TO REVIEW SOME OF THE BILLS WE RECEIVED... ON THIS YEAR'S THANKSGIVING PROMOTION. JUST, YOU KNOW, YOUR NORMAL OPERATING EXPENSES, MOTHER. OH, REALLY? YEAH. WE HAD TO REPLACE SIX AUTOMOBILE WINDSHIELDS, ONE PLATE GLASS WINDOW FOR TONY'S PIZZERIA, AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, COVER SEVERAL MEDICAL BILLS. YEAH, MOM, BUT, YOU SEE, NOTHING MAJOR. THOSE PEOPLE WERE IN AND OUT OF THE HOSPITAL... JUST LIKE THAT. - WHAT HAPPENED? - OH, UH, UH... WELL, WE GAVE AWAY FREE TURKEYS. - WHAT'S SO UNUSUAL ABOUT THAT? - WELL, THEY WERE LIVE TURKEYS. WHAT'S SO UNUSUAL ABOUT THAT? THE WAY WE GAVE 'EM AWAY. ALL RIGHT, FELLOW BABIES. AND NOW IT'S TIME TO GO TO OUR LIVE REMOTE MAN ON THE SCENE... AT THE PINEDALE SHOPPING MALL FOR THE BIG WKRP TURKEY GIVEAWAY. SO TAKE IT AWAY, LES NESSMAN. NOW, THE CROWD IS... THE CROWD IS, UH, CURIOUS BUT WELL-BEHAVED. AND I THINK I HEAR SOMETHING NOW. UH, THE CROWD IS MOVING OUT INTO THE PARKING AREA. AND, OH, YES, I CAN SEE IT NOW. IT'S A... IT'S A HELICOPTER! AND IT'S COMING THIS WAY. - A HELICOPTER? - IT'S FLYING SOMETHING BEHIND IT. I CAN'T QUITE MAKE IT OUT. IT'S A LARGE BANNER. AND IT SAYS, UH, "HAPPY... "THANKS... "GIVING... "FROM W... "K... "R... P." WHAT A SIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WHAT A SIGHT. THE COPTER SEEMS TO BE CIRCLING THE PARKING AREA NOW. I GUESS IT'S LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO LAND. NO, SOMETHING JUST CAME OUT OF THE BACK OF THE HELICOPTER. IT'S, UH, A DARK OBJECT. PERHAPS A SKYDIVER PLUMMETING TO THE EARTH... FROM ONLY 2,000 FEET IN THE AIR. THERE'S A SECOND AND A THIRD. THERE'S NO PARACHUTES YET. THOSE CAN'T BE SKYDIVERS. I CAN'T TELL JUST YET WHAT THEY ARE, BUT... OH, MY GOD! THEY'RE TURKEYS! OH, MY GOD! JOHNNY, CAN YOU GET THIS? THEY'RE CRASHING TO THE EARTH RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES! ONE JUST WENT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF A PARKED CAR! JOHNNY, THIS IS TERRIBLE. THE CROWD IS RUNNING AROUND PUSHING EACH OTHER. OH, MY GOODNESS! OH, THE HUMANITY! ALL THE PEOPLE ARE RUNNING ABOUT. THE TURKEYS ARE HITTING THE GROUND LIKE SACKS OF WET CEMENT. HONESTLY, FOLKS, I... I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER... THE CROWD... LES? LES? LES, ARE YOU THERE? LES ISN'T THERE. THANKS FOR THAT ON-THE-SPOT REPORT, LES. AND, UM, FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO JUST TUNED IN, THE PINEDALE SHOPPING MALL HAS JUST BEEN BOMBED WITH LIVE TURKEYS. FILM AT 11:00. ARTHUR, YOU MEAN TO TELL ME YOU THOUGHT TURKEYS COULD FLY? WELL, THEY HAVE WINGS, YOU KNOW. BUT FOR SOME REASON, THEY DON'T USE 'EM. MR. TRAVIS, WKRP SEEMS TO BE IN MORE TROUBLE TODAY... THAN IT WAS BEFORE YOU GOT HERE. AM I RIGHT, MR. TRAVIS? I SUPPOSE IT LOOKS THAT WAY. NO. NO, YOU'RE NOT RIGHT, MOTHER. THIS TURKEY PROMOTION IDEA, THAT WAS MINE. BEFORE HE CAME HERE, WE WERE JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS AROUND HERE. BUT NOW... NOW EVERYBODY CARES. WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ARTHUR? THIS STATION'S A MESS. IT IS NOT, EITHER! T-T-TELL HER, ANDY. NO, YOU TELL ME! OKAY. I AM THE MANAGER. I'M SORRY THAT YOU THINK WE'RE ALL SO INCOMPETENT AROUND HERE. BUT WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE CAN. IF THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU, THEN YOU GET SOMEBODY ELSE TO RUN YOUR BLINKIN' STATION. OH, YOU DON'T THINK I CAN GET ANOTHER JOB? WELL, YOU JUST WATCH ME, MUMMY. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - I'M OVER 40. WHERE I GO IS NONE OF YOUR BEESWAX. AND YOUR 20 MINUTES, THEY'RE UP! PERFECT. PERFECT? THAT MAN PREPARED FOR THIS MEETING FOR A WEEK. AND YOU SAT THERE AND YOU MOWED HIM DOWN LIKE HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD. MR. TRAVIS, I'M A VERY SMART WOMAN. I OWN AND OPERATE A MULTITUDE OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES. - WELL, GOOD FOR YOU. - BUT I AM A ROTTEN MOTHER. EVER SINCE ARTHUR WAS A CHILD, I PUSHED AND BULLIED HIM BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD MAKE HIM HARD AND STRONG. WELL, I WAS WRONG. IT MADE HIM SOFT AND WEAK. NO, I DON'T THINK SO. MAYBE NOT. DO YOU KNOW TODAY WAS THE FIRST TIME ARTHUR EVER WALKED OUT OF A ROOM... WITHOUT ASKING MY PERMISSION? THAT'S A VERY GOOD SIGN. WELL, MA'AM, YOU SURE HAVE A FUNNY WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS. THAT'S BECAUSE I AM HARD AND STRONG. I GUESS I LACK ARTHUR'S... "SWEETNESS," FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD. TAKE GOOD CARE OF MY BOY, MR. TRAVIS. WAIT A MINUTE. THAT'S IT? THAT'S ALL? - THAT'S ALL. - WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE STATION? OH, THAT. WELL, IF THE RATINGS AREN'T UP BY THE NEXT SURVEY, YOU'RE ALL LUNCHEON MEAT. THANKS. JUST BUSINESS. NOTHING PERSONAL. GOOD-BYE, MR. TRAVIS. MY 20 MINUTES... THEY'RE UP. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
