 WKRP in Cincinnati (1978–1982): Season 1, Episode 4 - Hoodlum Rock - full transcript 
 In an attempt to relate to the new rock audience, WKRP books an up and coming British hoodlum rock band called "Scum of the Earth" to play in Cincinnati. Things get crazy when the staff discovers the band members are out-of-control on and off the air and eventually threaten to not perform. Incidentally, the difference between hoodlum rock and punk rock??? Punk rockers dress deplorably and don't physically attack their audience.
