 WKRP in Cincinnati (1978–1982): Season 1, Episode 11 - The Contest Nobody Could Win - full transcript 
 When Johnny misreads a contest prize as $5,000 instead of $50, Andy & Venus try to make the contest unwinnable by slicing short parts of songs together. Unfortunately someone still wins. Herb convinces Carlson that it is the "dungaree" generation sabotaging the "suits" generation and pushes Carlson to the brink of firing Andy, Venus & Johnny. However, it is Johnny to the rescue when Les & Herb accidentally give the prize money to the wrong person.
