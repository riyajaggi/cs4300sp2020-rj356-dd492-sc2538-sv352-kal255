 WKRP in Cincinnati (1978–1982): Season 1, Episode 5 - Hold Up - full transcript 
 Things are slowly starting to pick up when Herb sells his new client, Del's Stereo Shop, on a remote. Things go bad when Johnny broadcasts from the stereo shop, no customers show up, Bucky (the engineer) breaks tons of equipment, and an out-of-work deejay holds the store up.
