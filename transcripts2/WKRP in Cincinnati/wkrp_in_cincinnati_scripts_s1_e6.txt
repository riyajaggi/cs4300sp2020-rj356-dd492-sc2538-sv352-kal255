 WKRP in Cincinnati (1978–1982): Season 1, Episode 6 - Bailey's Show - full transcript 
 Bailey convinces WKRP to institute a one-hour public affairs show, but getting sane guests for the Johnny-hosted show proves tough. Bailey finally finds child-psychologist Dr. Hyman Monroe for the first show. Unfortunately Dr. Monroe's credentials and theories on juvenile delinquents prove to be less than reliable on-the-air.
