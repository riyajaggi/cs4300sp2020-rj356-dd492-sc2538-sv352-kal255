 Imagine a space scientist A barren land Hot enough to boil water Where the mysterious drilling in the surface Delegate from the impact of the battles Reveal a maze of dusty tunnels Each of them wide enough to leave a city This world is dead However, it broadcasts life on its nearest neighboring planet This space place is closer than you imagine It is our moon "The Ways of the Universe"

 Look at our system Solar system from the perspective of a space visitor What will surprise you? What makes you reconsider? The answer is not possible? Our giant moon If you look at our moon and its satellites All other satellites in our solar system It is very strange It's huge, much bigger than Other satellites in the solar system Compared to his planet It is a huge moon, it makes us A binary planet. Two particles revolve around each other To some extent Our moon is near the size of a planet Unique in the solar system

 This is a giant delegate of Battles serve as our guardian angel His great appeal lifts the tide that leads life In the Earth's oceans The moon keeps our planet Milan It regulates climate and seasons Without the moon, when man came We owe everything to the moon Yet its composition is even greater Mysterious Mysteries in Planetary Science There are many theories about the emergence of our giant moon But they all start in the same way The formation of the inner solar system 4.6 billion years ago When the solar system arose, it seemed Is quite different from what it seems now Instead of a few planets and a large space Around the sun, there is a disk This disk was thick It consisted of gas, dust and rocky bodies The sun shone with life The distance of gas withdrawal nearby The fallen rocky fallows gather together Over time to be planets like Earth But it is more than we see today The huge rocks contend for their positions Intersect in their struggle to find stable orbits Could one of those planets be destined for him To become our moon? There are many theories About the emergence of our giant moon Assume a theory that he was walking around In our system the sun and we were a whole According to the theory of families A passing planet passes very soon Of the land of the young, and did The gravity of our entire planet The planet settled in Earth orbit It became the moon we see today This theory took everything But scientists needed proof of their authenticity It is true that the moon is a captive planet We expect its components Will be different from Earth It was something that grew up in a place different from Earth Then he was captured, so we expect them to be Made of different materials To prove the theory Scientists needed to compare the first moon rocks With similar samples on the ground The best rock for comparison is a metal that is not formed Except when the newborn moon was still melted On the ground, this type of rock is formed "In active places volcanoes such as" Iceland Games 00:04:45,866 --> 00:04:48,201 This is what we want You see this anorthoscope Anorthosis is formed in a manner Different from normal basalt You may count it as white foam On top of a dim beer, it floats upward So in the magma environment ... consists and floats higher Sea of ??magma Take an anthurpose sample from the moon Important because rocks are darker Its chemical composition may be altered by asteroid collisions We take a sample of those anortholic rocks Because we will not know the origin of the moon Of dark matter We must have this rock composition to tell us about The origin of the moon , In the 1970s Apollo astronauts collected samples They brought her to the ground to compare them The results stunned the scientific world They found that the components of the moon Almost identical With ground crust components So the hypothesis that the moon was A captive planet from somewhere In the solar system have been excluded It can never be corrected The rocks looked like earth in several respects This was a mystery Excluding the theory of the captive planet Planetary scientists did something "The scholars said," We must meet and know this "They went together to a conference in" Kuna - Hawaii All prominent scientists in planetary science They argued all the salient assumptions People thought that scientists without imagination We're just robots looking at things and analyzing them Not so If you want to know how something like the moon grew up Your imagination must be wild And try to impose those crazy assumptions But you must be bound by reality They confined themselves together in a room They left this meeting "This is useful The new theory Focusing on water content Of the moon rocks It was surprisingly dry Something must be heating The moon is very hot We were directed to think that it should Be a kind of collision The theory was based on a hypothesis A catastrophic collision 4.5 billion years ago But she did not hit the moon She was hitting the ground There was a crazy theory That when the earth was formed While she was young Another particle the size of a planet Something about the size of Mars ... came and hit the ground He detonated a large quantity of material Which merged and formed the moon It was a fantastic hypothesis She was a pioneer Scientists have launched the planet "Near the size of Mars by" Thea Imagine how the collision happened 4.5 billion years ago Thea hit the ground The tossing of the collision is melting into space Forming a ring of burning rocks around the earth ... if we can turn back time We somehow stood on The surface of the earth when the moon grew It would have been amazing A luminous ring of fire was stretching across the sky There was a shiny ball here in the sky Of glowing magma With all the small berries and rocks that were attracted To that point because of the enormous gravity , It was the first moon The particle that will eventually become The moon in our skies today Our moon grew up in less than a year Its crust is chemically identical with the earth's crust Because they share the same origin , This collision theory, although it seemed strange They do the best job in interpretation Everything we see about the moon Has become the hypothesis of the theoretical clash prominent In the birth of our giant moon But when the space probes Visit the far side of the moon I found what refutes the theory Our moon has a secret He grew up with a twin Look at the moon tonight You may see a familiar face Or perhaps a rabbit Or a tree, depending on your culture Myths and myths surrounding the engraved forms On the moon But what you can Those signs are to be cut off from a mystery Our Giant Guard? What we call the "human face moon" is only a chain From light and dark patches On the moon, of course People are programmed to recognize faces everywhere That's why we see this ... face These dark patches look unique to the moon Centuries ago, astronomers thought they saw The vast ocean of liquid water We now know that dark pigments are old floods Of lava "Scientist of Planetary Geology" by Gani Radhibo Pick up a scene from above "For similar characteristics on" Hawaii Using a research camera This flow of lava on which we stand is similar The things we would see if we stood On the dark patches of the moon It's dark It is made of basalt and flows In a massive flow of lava across the surface It turned out that the dark plains of lava on the moon Are battle scars Evidence of a violent past Four billion years ago, asteroids raged On the newborn moon, torn by its surface Where the torn crust is thin The melted lava flows Hot Subcontinent of the Moon Scattered in great pools And harden to be scars Which we see today from the earth Strangely, though, the moon is spinning The gravity of the earth is firmly attached to it Where it is the same face Directed to us in all ages Making monuments on the far side of the moon A great mystery In all times, the distant side of the moon It was invisible to the earth It's the back side, you can not see it , In 1959 "Soviet spacecraft" Luna-3 Passed by the distant moon She filmed it for the first time Astronomers thought the vision of vamps White and black known They received a big surprise When the scientists saw the pictures, they were stunned The far side looked different Quite on the near side It is filled with volcanoes It looked like a huge split No one expected it at all There are still collision nozzles Huge in the far side But they were weak on a regular basis There seemed to be no dark lava flow on the surface But why? The only solution we came up with Is a difference in thickness between the crust The near side and the farthest side crust This must be the side The remote is so thick that Lava can not rise through it And erupt out across the surface In contrast, on the side Facing, very high Lava can easily climb through the cracks And flow to the surface NASA's new missions confirmed that the crust In the back of the moon more than thirty thickness Miles on the veneer on the facade The far side is thicker It is not as if a part of it is thick without the other The other side of the moon It has more crust Thickness of near side It's weird One of the greatest mysteries in planetary science For over fifty years Why was the crust of the far side too thick? Collision theory does not cover it She formed the moon but did not say why Quite different from one another Unless something strange happens New era of super computers bring The first amazing explanation Maybe the collision made "Thea" two satellites Not a single moon This dual birth may also be explained Our moon is different sides According to the theory, 4.5 billion years ago There were two moons in the night sky The younger moon pursued his older brother Gradually approaching ... In the end, the two moons slowly merged The smaller moon covered The far side of the Big Moon They made a new thicker crust Not all collisions High-speed violent incidents Which extrudes materials everywhere Instead of just bumping into him He merged with him Torn and merged with the moon Basically, when you look at half of the moon You see one body And when you look at the other side of the moon You see most of the other body that covered The first body, for this is Thicker in this aspect Qamaran is one The evidence of this global collision is increasing At least within supercomputers But not all astronomers are convinced Looking in the sky for a different solution And finally found it on a space planet It was roasted alive , 480 light-years away from our solar system Earth-like rocky planet It revolves around a star similar to the sun But not a place of life Corot-7b is "very close to its sun" This strange outer planet The star revolves around sixty times From the distance of the earth's rotation around the sun This great convergence remains one of the faces of the planet Facing his partner The face of the moon remains facing the earth ... and the result Connie BBQ Heat rises to more than 3000 degrees Fahrenheit On the planet's closest face The rock surface shrinks into a boiling ocean Of liquid magma In contrast, the shaded distant side of the planet It has a hard and cool crust This burning outer planet is inspiring An amazing new theory about composition Our moon is heterogeneous 297 00:16:54,605 ??--> 00:16:57,941 The hypothesis comes from two young researchers They have no background on moon science For I work in the field of outer planets, so I know little About the lunar terrain when the whole thing started In 2011, Jason Wright was discussing The outer planets are close to their star with their colleagues When the discussion turned to ambiguity The crust of my face is the moon And then I remembered that the moon when it was formed It was very close to the ground, and the earth was Very hot after the collision that the moon formed In fact, the geometry itself is quite the same "With the system" Corot-7B That made me think "Maybe something similar happened with the moon" Suppose "Jason" that the earth is hot The face of the moon was burned Stars also burn planets nearby If you imagine the composition of the moon The earth was a huge burning ball hanging In the sky, it will be the side The distance to the moon is very cold The face of the moon was hot By the melted earth The vast clouds of vapor Metal flows from the hot surface Feeding a cloud surrounding the moon On the cold face, condensing Those metals are falling rain To adopt a thicker crust It is an organized hypothesis, but it does not succeed Unless the moon keeps one face On the ground immediately after its formation "Jason" asked the graduate "Arbita Roy That she felt this was possible When Jason came to me with the hypothesis He was enthusiastic about her I think it was strong Check accounts of the moon's extended restriction It was very easy The figure was so small that we were surprised It was about a hundred days It is very fast in astronomical time scale The scientific jump of "Arbeta" means The near side of the moon is restricted to the earth While our planet is still melted To support Jason's theory of the flaming moon It is still very new but has props In science, if there were two theories explain something In a good way, we will tend to theory Which has a more natural result This theory of inflamed land is a natural result Because we do not know it happened Fortunately, the surface of the earth Cooler today But the interior is still hot Thanks to the radioactive decay of metals three hundred fifty 00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:48,045 In the soles of the earth's core This rising heat is what revolutionizes volcanoes And the geological activity we see on the surface today There are mountain chains that have made their way And other mountain ranges that were put in the ocean The earth's crust is constantly changing The moon has no radiation So scientists have always assumed that its center Cool and its geological features are dead But assume a series of unexplained observations We are wrong again about the moon One of the big questions we are trying to answer Over the course of a few decades Previous Is there any activity Lag on the moon? For hundreds of years, astronomers reported About strange emissions of light from the moon Others saw red flares It lasted for minutes at a time Do those rare signs show that the heart The geology of the moon is still beating? The moon is too small, so that it For more than four billion years He must have repented all this time There are still things we see Perhaps denote That something is happening inside Arsterx is a "volcanic zone" In the north-west of the face near the moon It is a hot spot in exotic sights Scientists have reported more than seven hundred glare here In the last 50 years Even Neil Armstrong saw something strange "From the window of a landing vehicle" Apollo-11 Houston, "I look north toward Erstrx now" {\ an5} There is an {\ an5} More light about it {\ an5} There is a brilliance of it ... very light {\ an5} Flag 11, we receive it What is going on in Arsterx? Volcanic aspects of the volcano Give planetary scientists an idea Because where there is smoke, there must be fire Guide on how these events occur on the moon Is its place It is in a very privileged location On the moon, it is very similar What we stand now Erstrx "covered with a great flood" Of volcanic ash Some scientists believe that those Thin light material Responsible for the evidence The alien we see from the earth The type of ash I'm carrying now A little wet due to modern rains ... in the area, while the ash Which we had to carry in the "Erstrx" would be soft The gases emitted from this active volcano Carry particles of fine volcanic ash And evaporate into the air The sun illuminates columns, making them visible for miles Something similar might happen on the moon There is gas, coming out of an outlet Captures the very soft lunar dust and scatters it Through its features So we see it lit by sunlight If the theory is correct It means that the moon's volcanoes are still active There is something amazing It is hard to understand our minds About the fact that the moon It may still spring today I mean we thought for years The moon is cold and dead But these events may now occur This means that the moon is not dead Moon neighborhood, this is very exciting We thought we understood the moon But the deeper the scientists They found another secret Probably the biggest secret yet It was without the moon when we were here The earth and the moon were born together They have dramatically shaped the evolution of each other We now believe that life has taken a strong start With our giant moon This is the Earth 4.4 billion years ago Near the time scientists thought That life on earth has begun The newborn moon settles Only fifteen thousand miles away To appear more massive in the sky than today His attractiveness raises an enormous range In the warm, young Earth oceans At that time, the tide could not be measured by foot They were measured by miles There were tsunami waves that were drifting On the land and then retreat to the sea The moon's gravity makes waves Pulling the Earth's oceans towards it In the bump of the water, when the earth revolves This extrusion drifts on the land as a mound The closer the moon, the greater the gravity The tide was stronger Some scientists believe that the rocky ponds are warm Left by the first tidal waves It has formed the ideal hydrocarbon space For the components of life to come together Good about the swamp When environments change Water progresses and brings nutrients and then recedes The nutrients are concentrated So there was a process She focused on what was left behind In a way that led to the emergence of life 4.4 billion years ago Tidal waves provoked organic molecules Of the earth's surface When the tide recedes, these chemicals lag behind In shallow rock pools Then evaporate in the heat of the sun To concentrate its chemical components Perhaps the first life arose Inside this organic rich stew If we had little moons Around the Earth like Mars There were never waves The tides that bear Elements and energy to the beach environment Where life may have had a foot So, we did not have minerals We did not have energy Maybe we would not have had a life Did the moon bring life to earth? ... Scientists are still deliberating, but surely Smart life takes time to develop In our case, at least four billion years We gradually changed from simple single cells To the creature who wonders about its origins And the moon gave life to stability to develop By maintaining the stability of the central tilt of the earth For more than four billion years The moon maintained this inclination and rose By establishing the pivotal role He maintained that the chapters were the same Century after century, and millennium after millennium When we look at Milan Earth He was the same at the time Where complex life was present This is very important When we came from simple creatures Mono-cell to more complex creatures The great balance has helped How things are different Without the moon? Look at Mars only to see the catastrophic effects The unstable mile Mars already has a mile up to sixty degrees ... meant this It was cool in the equator on Mars It was warmer on the poles This environment is very difficult Life has to grow and flourish When we look at Mars We see his central tendency ... may swing to this degree Which has curbed life If the land is tilted to that problem Ice ages ended and ended as seasons Maybe life needed that Start from scratch again and again It does not have time to evolve into complex creatures Mars acts as an indicator that our giant moon He was a contributor to Genesis Smart life on Earth Scientists believe the increase That global partnerships A similarity is the key to finding Other smart neighborhoods in the universe When we look at the outer planets And wonder you may contain Civilizations and advanced forms of life Some had large moons Without others We said to first see planets with moons For this reason, we know In this world, we have moon Great and we have an advanced life When we look beyond our solar system We look at the galaxy Look for outer planets Which may be suitable for habitation Maybe we should look for a particle He has a giant moon in the right place About his star Perhaps it would be the right place to look for life If we wanted to see These distant outer planets are close We will need a cheap, reliable way to space The moon may be the key to solving that journey Towards the stars Thinkers That the amount of human invasion of space Surprisingly, the moon may be the key To achieve those dreams Because the lunar launch platform is much easier Of the Earth with regard to the atmosphere and gravity If we set up a base on the moon, for example We need a little energy to get out of the moon We proceed to explore other bodies from there What will it take to build a lunar launch platform? It turned out that the biggest drawback is Maintain the life of the ground crew One of the greatest risks In your presence on the moon You are not protected by a magnetic shield You do not have that on the moon If a big solar storm strikes The particle flow is high Energy will strike astronauts The card is too large to break cells And destroy our nuclear DNA The moon is also exposed to radiation Which originate from outside the solar system The distant supernovae throw charged particles Called cosmic rays near the speed of light On the ground, most of what comes comes from our atmosphere But on the moon, the pioneers are in the crossfire Many of them were told about seeing small flashes When cosmic rays collide with their visual nerves Space rocks contained another major danger on the moon On the moon, there is no atmosphere If there was something the size of a grain of sand They move faster than the speed of the shot If he had collided with your colony They can hole a large hole on the wall Another major obstacle to long-term survival On the moon is a large variation in temperature One of the things we really do not think about The air around us is that it distributes the heat On the moon there is no air If half your hand was in the sun And the other half in the shade The difference in temperature will be 400 degrees Best prevention Of those long-term problems Is a thick layer of rock But a recent discovery is supposed That future pioneers They will not need to dig to build their underground shelters Their eminent fossils are found on the moon The "alcove" is called the size of a football field We see large openings leading to giant cave systems May be the most suitable base for lunar exploration Slots are network entrances Of the vast tunnels, which extend for miles Under the moon There are caves under the surface there They did not cut it But her apartment is lava Similar tunnels, called lava tubes You are on the ground in "Volcanic regions such as" Iceland We are at the bottom of a pit formed From a broken tube We now know that it is on the moon There are such holes, even if the indicators are correct They also lead to such giant lava tubes Lava pipes are formed when they begin The melted rocks flowing in the cold The surface hardens first It secrete hot lava Below it and still flowing He splashed long tunnels under the ground Live in such a tube This will not be crazy In fact this is a huge tube, very huge But the pipes on the moon Greater than ten times On the moon, lava pipes are made Under rocky rocks with hundreds of feet It protects tunnels from radiation and microscopic comets And maintains the temperature stability Lava tube like this on the moon It will be wonderful and stable, and probably not much colder From the coldest cave on earth Astronauts on the moon They may lock themselves into those Pipe by adding air valves If we can colonize Lava tube under the lunar surface We can organize the environment We can pump air We can make the heat suitable You can go out and walk around In this huge tunnel under the surface You can build an entire city there And lighting the walls of the lunar tunnel Scientists believe that lunar space stations May be self-sufficient There are nozzles in the shade always It contains water ice, and this is very exciting Because we did not realize the existence Water on the moon so far We thought the moon was dry For several years .. and change the matter We now know that it is in the soil Inside the walls of the nozzles Always shaded, there is Lots and lots of water ice Water is the optimal resource for the Lunar Launch Platform In addition to drinking it, you can separate the water with electricity , To create oxygen to breathe And hydrogen for use as fuel When you think about it, the rocket fuel Composed of liquid hydrogen And liquid oxygen These are what water is Bear the craters of the moon About six billion tons of water ice This is enough to launch 20 rockets into space Every day for more than a hundred years For more than four billion years The leg of the moon is our evolution It formed our climate, and in the future His resources will allow us to invade space But he will not live forever Scientists have detailed the death of the moon It will be harsh For more than four billion years The Earth and the Moon took turns An extreme balance around the sun But our heavenly neighbor is gradually escaping Sometimes we talk about certain things We always say there is nothing certain As sunrise, right? We can imagine the moon in the same way It passes through its phases It exists night after night and year after year But it is clear that the moon Stay away from this earth and see to Interaction between the moon and the protrusion of the earth The water bumps gravity A little ahead of the moon Because the earth revolves around itself Faster than the moon's rotation around the earth The moon gravitates the tension And slow the rotation of the earth around its axis Over billions of years Earth turnover would have slowed considerably We were walking fast Maybe our turnover is weak now But like a charismatic cord The lunar attraction will accelerate its orbit This speed makes the moon's orbit wider He pushed him farther It is a small amount, does not exceed The 3.8 centimeter, about an inch and a half a year After billions of years The moon will shrink to a point in the night sky The rotation of the earth around itself will be very slow So that the moon appears above our heads There will come a time when the earth will be fixed The face of the earth will face one face of the moon The two will be synchronized There will be one place On the ground you see the moon So imagine that you will have to go A holiday to see the moon at the time But it will be a long time from now I will not start booking your tickets now Is this the distant future of our moon? ... Some scientists envision a more exciting end Death will burn, which will destroy the moon Perhaps life on earth The process begins with the expansion of the sun The real future history of the earth and moon system Will fall on the sun Amazing effects may occur When the sun shines it expands To fill the inner solar system With more intense solar wind These winds will intercept the moon When the moon turns around the Earth there will be resistance There will be more particles in space The moon will resist So the moon kept moving away from the earth Billions of years Maybe he will start coming back This new internal path is a spiral of death In the end, the moon will lick Approaching Because of the attractive forces Tidal forces will be so strong Explode from the ground The moon will be removed from Earth 11,000 miles Will arrive at the point of no return The earthy pull of the earth will crush him in the end You will vibrate and shake Will bend It will bend over and away from us It is hard to say that you will see it in the end ... already ruptured A whole world will be torn by the gravity of the earth The lagoon of the moon A Saturn-like ring will be made of rock remains Having a ring around the earth will be an amazing sight I would like to see it You may look up and see the ring It will be in the corner of the ground If you were in the right place in the earth , You will be able to see it Wide and extended across the sky I do not know if you could see her during the day But at night It will be one of the most wonderful scenes I can imagine But the beauty will soon turn into horror When the fall of the ring falls on the earth It will be a spectacular spectacle A scary sight The whole sky will be full With meteor showers flowing through the sky It would be huge In the end, all those materials Will merge into the ground , And now, these two brothers Separated at the time of their birth They will unite again in one body A new land will be born from a fiery hell But this world will be alive The presence of the moon has allowed the emergence of life on Earth The presence of the moon will also destroy life on Earth The moon gave life, and it will also defeat it These are regular events Although it is not good for us It is a pity to imagine Earth without the moon We are partners, we have influenced each other Seeing the moon in the sky gives pleasure to Each time, she did not say We can only draw towards him It's there every night staring at us Of course, I wrote about him romances We will continue to write about him Life may not exist on earth without the moon But even if life were created without it You will be less romantic
