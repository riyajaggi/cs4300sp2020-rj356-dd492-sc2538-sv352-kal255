 Everyone new dazzling We did not know Pluto was so complicated In 2015, Pluto showed us his heart. But your biggest secrets are below Can hold Pluto Small forms of space life Three billion miles from the sun? Translated by: dr_sameh_nour yahoo, com Ways of working the universe History of the Pluto secret Mechanical probes equipped with scientific equipment It has been collecting photos for our solar system system for over forty years These close-ups told us What We Know About Our Nearest Relatives If you are a scientist on the planet, you have to go there. To clarify things in detail You will make great discoveries But the image was an escape From the eyes of our machinery

 Pluto Pluto Pluto kept our planets away Even modern astronomers have discovered many other snowy bodies orbiting beside Pluto In 2006, Plut frao's weak position was downgraded Pluto small, smaller than our moon far, almost three billion miles So you got no better Approaching just like a weak spot The best of our photos for Pluto Hubble Space Telescope The Hubble Space Telescope can not only take twenty pixels around Pluto We know there are bright and dark spots We did not know what it was, and it was not a clear picture. This confusing image everything What we have to know what Plut o We know of nitrogen ice, we know With a moon, we know there are other things But we still have to go because it's so far Three billion miles or more We need to go there to understand this. , Summer 2015 NASA's New Horizons probe flew near Pluto To complete a nine-year Earth journey It records the first few pictures nearby The absolute of the worlds is obscured Many scientists hoped to find In a flat and inert world like our moon But the images showed an incredibly diverse world High mountains and large glaciers And extended plains without volcanic craters All of which refer to the recent geological activity Pluto appeared active When we saw high-definition images for the first time What showed Pluto tall and complex It was an incredibly emotional feeling For all of us in the Task Force We got this picture that showed a huge mountain Strange mountains and flat plains with no volcano in this image It was an active modern geological area Some characteristics are revealed by a New Horizons vehicle "contradicts simple interpretations" One of the amazed mountains The vast surface of Pluto Above a deep bass These mountains look like small volcanoes But how to be possible on a surface A planet composed mainly of snow If you saw a match in it The Earth will say that this is a volcano If you saw it on Mars, you would say that it is a volcano But Pluto is surprised, there is nothing The volcanoes are taking Pluto to our knowledge What are these things? The mysterious mountains in Pluto are huge Its width is more than 100 miles and rises to three miles To accommodate these complex terrains Scientists look similar ground here on earth Planetary geologists such as Jenny Radebag "call his shield of volcanoes" This volcano we mean The broad shell called island s But called volc nico A shield that we are about to give a slap The volcanoes are formed Long lava revolutions in progress It is said to represent a form of Shield Warrior lying on the ground This volcano erupted only nine thousand years ago We can see a large beak here and some quite similar to typical pyramidal volcanoes too deep here, deeper than I expected This is a very modern volcano, so the crater can be clearly seen We can see some nozzles in Pluto's volcanoes are clearly protected why we thought it could be a bloody volcanic eruption They are wide and do not have craters like this one. normal to see Dir'iya volcanoes on other planets Mars often constituted by rocks "And his great bondage," Mount Olympus Consisting of massive lava revolutions Millions of years ago But it washes dissolved rocks, and that's a problem. Because Pluto very small and far A lot about the sun until it melts anything If their general characteristics are volcanic, they must consist of something other than lava "Jenny Radabag" believes that color The mysterious heights of Pluto Showing conclusive evidence The kind of revolutions that are made This form of volcanoes Hundreds of thousands of revolutions over time It erupted from cracks and ran across the surface And accumulated from each other And it remained in place to adopt Wide coverage over time The same happened with Pluto But the lava that revolts from Pluto does not look like this No of dark color and no basalt Consists of water ice In contrast to Earth, Pluto has a surface of icy nitrogen above the bottom layer of the rock And a solid ice sheet But every now and then some icy water dissolves To be explosive flows of liquid solution To play on the surface of Pluto as you do Hot stone lava in the ground The hot mud quickly freezes The surface enlarged to be ample snow shields Like the rock shells on Earth and Mars If the water melted under the surface Some things, some energy It explodes across the surface and flows Like lava here on earth Instead of volcanoes like here, there are icebergs Cold volcanoes in distant objects We have a narrow view of the universe in our faith Everything happens in this, as it happens here The volcanoes here on the ground are hot But Pluto is cool and not hot Perhaps the most surprising of Pluto's volcanoes is free of collision nozzles Which means that the warm mud may have sprouted from them recently These features are modern Pluto active today, there was not enough time to bomb Pluto's meteorites To collect a set of nozzles on the surface Pluto active today, this is the news Possibility of active volcanoes Pluto surprises scientists But they were surprised when they came up Flat closeup images of Flat Pluto Because a snowy bathtub The size of "Texas" seems to boil Our solar system brings the effects of the violent past Bench Craters Rocky planets and moons like our moon But these typical monuments were removed by lava, water and wind If you look at the moon every now and then A thousand years will not look different But look at Earth now, and an hour later We have climate, we have volcanoes Our lakes appear and disappear Increased sea level Declines for thousands of years All this geological activity We say that the earth is a living world Scientists hoped Pluto was full of nozzles A world that is geologically inert like our moon But when the New Horizons passed in 2015 It showed a snowy heart-shaped facility It looks younger than the rest of the planet And the western part of that easy, Sputnik basin "was completely free of the nozzles" Of all the things that we have seen it in the following photos The heart, the Sputnik basin was the most We are amazed, amazed and intriguing "The broad and superficial surface of Spatnik" Opens a window on the unexpected activity of Pluto Because much like an act Glaciers are here on Earth There is no visible nozzle on the surface , Which tells us immediately that they are modern Some of which are estimated in 10 million years How this thing has changed and changed This is a very modern geological concept There must be something active on that surface. To be so flat One thing is to polish the surface of the Sputnik basin regularly But what? Scientists exclude previous volcanoes What makes mountains without plains What can it be? The first guide comes from a hidden obscure line. It seems that it feeds the edge of the north plains These winding features resemble icebergs Flowing from the rivers Glacial mountain here on earth See here the Huge glacier crosses the valley spilled on a lake of ice One of the first things we noticed when we saw "Images close to" New Horizons It is not the vast plain of ice Flat surface, but a net feeding the ice How these frozen valleys Flowing into a larger continental glacier The snow should be formed in Pluto Heights. "And then it flows into the Sputnik basin How to flow downstream from high mountains here on earth But in Pluto, cold To allow the flow of snow water Banks that feed the bowl should Sputnik " filled with a different kind of snow" Ice should consist of elements such as nitrogen Nitrogen fills most of our coverage, g s here But it freezes in the cold and becomes snow Nitrogen Glyde I have nitrogen snow For a of toothpaste with Plut o It flows through the mountains Which consists of water ice The ice rivers are flowing, and above that there are no craters above, it is active modern and today flows Now we believe that the "Sputnik" basin is full of frozen nitrogen And fed by northern mountain glaciers This a constant flow of nitrogen Explains why the basin boundaries are smooth But what about areas that fall away from the flow of ice? Another thing should be cleared Mouthpieces from the middle of the bathtub Think "Jenny Radabag" in this style "Strange on the surface of the Sputnik basin Assumes a surprising probability The surface of Pluto may be boiling Welcome to the Sputnik basin, I mean, this is what you see if you were on the surface of Pluto. You see a deep ice behind us The white ice extends over a great distance Behind us is a ring of mountains "When we look for the surface of the Sputnik basin We see cells of equal distances Round in the middle and spiked by the sides It has the appearance of something that consists of convection If you look for some oats, it boils It brings the article to the ridge Then pull it back to the sides The heat distributed over and over "Snow Nitrogen in the Sputnik Basin" Can be Cooked Like a Can of Oats But it seems so slow. The boiled surface is frozen at any moment. A similar but faster process created Decode in the most active lava on Earth The bubbles rise from the lava to be Circular cells on the surface Cold lava flows into the gaps That are made by hot bubbles of dissolved rocks "When we look for the surface of the Sputnik basin We see a slow lake We see the material rise and move Cai again when it cools It can be seen if we accelerate for several thousand years We will see each cell across the surface produce and boil To transport nitrogen thermally You must withdraw and realize how wonderful and strange Heat hovering around 400 degrees below zero The material is moving and moving, there is a geological movement And remember to do something cold like snow. Nitrogen flow does not require great energy. But it needs energy Pluto reveals its wonderful heart There must be a heart Warmer Beats under the surface But here in the frozen stretch For the outer space, the question remains What is the source of the heat? In 2015, a vehicle was stunned New Horizons "important scientists" When Pluto appeared as an active living world , Icebergs, mountain ranges and potential volcanoes Signs of geological activity marketed by heat But scientists are intrigued by the source of this heat Pluto small to avoid heat Its composition has been violent for more than four billion years And away from the sun, so that the light that The heating of the surface of our planet hardly affects Pluto It's about 20 minutes before dawn The light we see is light What we see on the surface of Pluto afternoon Where the amount of sunlight On the roof at maximum And because Pluto gets little sunlight Its surface is very cold to four hundred Fahrenheit degrees below zero This little world is far away from The sun receives little light We never dreamed that he would be an active scientist If the heat is not marketed Plut Plantao plant of sunlight Must come from the bottom But where? Best guess is that I have Pluto's circumference Water depth below the surface And somehow this ocean is marketed Warm up to the surface There is physical evidence that Pluto has a huge ocean inland When the planet returns over time, water is frozen When the water freezes, it forms From the energy called latent heat And this frozen ocean energy You can buy a large part of Pluto's activity Can cold water heat the planet? It sounds crazy, but it shows "Jenny Radabag" that peculiar physical characteristic Using a snow basin representing frozen Plutonium Crust A glass of water represents Pluto's hidden eye circuit First, the basin runs Snow to reduce the water temperature But once the water freezes, you will The heat inside the incredible cup Stand up It's thirty, you're ready to freeze, I'm going With a little help to see we can start We started, a slight movement, huh It is completely frozen and rises Heat quickly, jump eight degrees Look, she was thirty and she came in suddenly to 38 after freezing in seconds. It may seem the opposite of bvio, however gua gua releases energy to the side All kinetic energy, movement Water molecules in the liquid state They should be administered to water molecules that enter the crystalline structure This releases energy called inherent fusion heat They can warm up the neighborhood When the water freezes in the snow Thus, scientists believe that the latent heat in The Inner Ocean can direct the volcanoes in Pluto The upper layers of the inner ocean freeze whenever the liquid water matches the hardened snow at the top The freezing process releases latent heat Move through pluton layers Geological activity of the market on the surface The heat generated by the freezing process low But there is a whole layer of ocean What freezes the icing Decreases the amount of heat Snow volcanoes can evoke heat Freezing in some parts of surrounding liquid water This is incredible. Surprisingly lower grades of The heat that flows in the perimeter of Pluto Enough to market the Pluto surface To form mountain ranges and cause volcanoes And the formation of frozen nitrogen rivers Traversing the snow-covered slopes We humans are alone. We live on a hot planet If we landed underground a few miles The rocks are melted, they are very hot We believe that a great deal of energy is needed To market volcanoes and hot springs The movement of tectonic plates and all this But I do not The rocks only need great energy to melt Snow does not need much energy In any case, Pluto could heat up a bit and melt the snow from the water Can do the same geological activity Surface occurring here on Earth How do we expect our galaxy to be Snowy worlds like Pluto The universe must also contain many incredible things Maybe most of the worlds are in galaxies are worlds cold Probably most galaxy volcanoes are snowy volcanoes like the ones we see in Pluto Pluto changes the way Our thinking on the rocky planets He is active somehow, where he should not Our art "New Horizons" that Pluto has heat and liquid water This simple reality increases the probability of surprising Pluto may have a small stable at a distance of three billion miles from the sun Provide a hidden sanctuary for life? In the vast universe, we only know A planet inhabits life Our planet ,,, Earth We have all the necessary ingredients on the floor For life to come, there is no doubt that we exist But these three things, basically ,,, sources of energy ,,, and liquid water Organic molecules, molecules carbon base We always think that the Earth alone has three components But when she did the buyer and Saturn Mechanism probes Several active moons were found in the Terrestrial oceans, warmed by a hot volcanic eruption These worlds seem to be submerged with basic chemical components of life If we consider the moon of Jupiter "Europe" and Moon Saturn "Enceladus" are potential attendants of life The internal oceans of Pluto are not We believe that liquid water is likely, a source of heat You have the third component If it exists, it is strange to ask about the possibility of life in Pluto? The third component is the organic chemical composition Carbon-based molecules What builds the mechanism of life Surprisingly, astronomers believe that these complex chemicals It can automatically consist of the colder space You need simple inlaid gases In carbon and a source of energy Light generally The most active natural laboratory we know of for this The type of organic chemistry the huge lunar coverage of Saturn ,,, Tit When you see Titan, please cover it thicker, thicker than the surface of the Earth It is surrounded by a mist, which is composed mainly of organic molecules Which consists of more basic vehicles, which damaged by light above the psyche Which have accumulated to form those more complex organic compounds , Thickens Titan Envelope with single gases Methane, carbon monoxide and ammonia And when the sunlight hits the top Titan These gases must be complicated organic compounds That relate to the atmosphere To be dense layers of haze Scientists call these molecules The organic association consists of phonemes a generic term, which includes any one complex organic red molecule Who grew up from separation and reintroduction Collect simpler elementary molecules These organic particles, the arts Imagine how the lego building units of life On the ground, chemicals Like phonemes, they make up the cellular mechanism DNA and proteins that live in the cell If Pluto had a carbon-rich cape like Titan Do they produce phonies and, therefore, have a chance to live? When the New Horizons passed Pluto in 2015 The vehicle returned to a background photograph The ancient planet in front of the sun Scientists hope to get evidence of organic chemicals The results were more surprising than I expected We have seen the coating of the box, blue ring Nice nitrogen circulates in Pluto Like what we see on Earth Blue smudge layers The light our chemical plants Phonons are made of organic composite molecules From the simplest building units in the Pluto box Carbon monoxide and methane Nitrogen found in Pluto box Separated by sunlight and restored Paste them into these layers These are delicious organic molecules In Titan, the newly formed phonemes The atmosphere of the moon lights up To produce a layer of orange structure Of sticky organic material Scientists hope to see something happen in Pluto "But they are waiting to send" New Horizons The first colorful images of the ancient planet We received lots of photos of Pluto in black and white, but I look forward to seeing color images When I finally arrived, I saw these features The rich orange-red structure on the surface It was my first impression Organic Chemistry Surprise There are spots that look red or pink And when you see that color, you find In the organic matter immediately Actually, Organic pink materials The life we ​​know is not They can be found on the surface of Pluto It's very cold But if it was reused Phonons in the intestines of the planet They can be transported to areas of melting Liquid and potentially water The chemical evolution of these molecules The simple adhesion can continue l marketed by the poor heat of Pluto And maybe ,,, The mechanism of simple life work In the esoteric oceans of Pluto, as it happened In the oceans of the Earth four billion years ago I am captivated by the possibilities of expanding the circle of life around Our sun is farther than we dream Can life exist in Pluto or under its surface? I do not bargain at the moment. An interesting perspective Can there be a life in Pluto? I do not think that's my personal opinion They can take flour, butter, eggs and chips. Chocolates are mixed and placed in the oven You will not get a cake, but a sticky paste, or a mixture of rotten flavor While scientists argue the astonishing probability for life at a distance of three billion miles from the sun "Managed" New Horizons Your attention to the little satellites of Pluto Mission scientists know that Pluto has five worlds to follow But no one expected how strange these satellites were. When New Horizons arrived in Pluto Scientists blocked their breaths eagerly To learn the shape of Pluto's moons We do not know anything about this, what we will know about it The satellites will be the first time and it will be a surprise Before New Horizons arrived in Pluto three years ago The Hubble telescope filmed Five moons around the ancient planet One of them, a giant moon named Sharon And four much smaller snowmen New Horizons has been rescheduled to study these worlds And discovering additional satellites may be too small to be monitored by Hubble Before the vehicle passes, we investigate People about the number of additional satellites that we will find Some have guessed tenfold, others guessed And you guessed one of the most prominent members Our team did not have additional moons I remember going to him and saying He told me that I'll bet you at dinner "Anywhere in the United States" We'll find at least one extra Stern lost his bet New Horizons confirms that Hubble has spotted everything But for the greatness of the worlds of the five moons of Pluto Sharon appeared giant alongside Sticks, Knicks, Cerberus and Hydra Four small moons are less than 25 miles in diameter It was different from the satellites seen by astronomers before These objects were going faster than we expected. In addition, their polar bears and And spin on your sides like this This crazy behavior that we did not expect To understand these crazy orbits, he found Scientists are the evidence of the beginning of earth's history In the initial formation of the Kaieber belt These objects collided Snow is very close together As happened here on Earth when it collided An asteroid the size of Mars To be our lunar terrestrial system Maybe it happened with Pluto too. Perhaps a huge collision with Pluto in your life The moons of this huge collision Sharon settled in orbit near Pluto And four more small satellites revolves around the two bodies Small fragments of snowy fragments The first giant photo of Sharon A gray world looks dead He learned the scars of his violent past The largest scar ,,, giant, looks like He divides the moon in half Sharon is messed up The first thing that comes to mind when I saw this high definition image Moon "Frankenstein" looks like a moon A man broke with a hammer and chisel So he joined But what has the power to break A Texas-sized moon like Sharon? In frozen and frozen Bekaa From the outer solar system Scientists have only one choice: water There are four billion years, may have been for Sharon An internal fluid environment like Pluto today But because Sharon is much smaller, he is colder Faster, turning the whole ocean into snow Poor Sharon exploded If I took a soda dish and put it in the freezer When the gua frozen with refrigerant It expands without sheet metal You are exposed to more and more Press until you rip and open The material is lost This system of valleys And cracks through Sharon's middle Represents the latest hit in geological activity As if he had put the entrails out when he was freezing Internally, and on the way to becoming a dead world Sharon's last challenge was to be told The red polar cape of Sharon He caught the attention of missionary scientists They call it mordor point And this red hot spot The team put a great challenge Of all the incredible things, in Sharon, and the list goes on Maybe the subject was a bit of a mordor, I loved it. This is the area of ​​the North Sharon sky, which red for some reason , It is covered with red material We think that probably a phoneme a complex organic molecule Mordor seems to be covered in phonies, but how? This world does not have frozen ingredients or an involution to create complex organic molecules The sources must have come Sharon is ready, but from where? Pluto's unique logical answer At a distance of about ten thousand miles What does Pluto consist of And ends up with Sharon? No one sure But the thought will be this article I got to the cover of Pluto in some way And moved to the space to be deposited in the base on the North P Sharon No one understands how it happened This is wonderful because there are so many puzzles Remaining and we need more studies Even with all the data we have We have many questions that we must answer But we bear something about Pluto's operation This allowed scientists to imagine the future of this frozen world Pluto is about to wake up from deep, cold sleep In 2015, a small automatic transient survey was launched Pluto launched the shutter camera High definition images have surprised the world Glacial rivers, flat plains With signs of active volcanoes But it seemed a lot of photos Imposs vel at first sight When we consider this The new world is completely in us We see things that are difficult to interpret from the first sight There are dives and canals like Lagos or even small rivers These flow characteristics are made of nitrogen Although frozen now, it was Liquid in the near geological past But this? Pluto cold and has a thin crust To allow the presence of fluids on its surface Fluids are difficult to obtain throughout the universe Everything seems solid or invasive You do not need the proper conditions For this liquid state of matter Even for nitrogen, you'll bring heat and nitrogen There must also be some atmospheric pressure We need a thicker envelope to keep liquid nitrogen on the surface. The scientists conclude that in the last million years A great event led Pluto Evaporates glaciers The -filled shell But what can cause the big change in climate? Scientists first looked to orbit Pluto prominently around the sun Once every 248 years The orbit of an oval pluto approaches the sun But this brief period of heat Summer is not enough to make the thick Pluton shell As you approach the sun it accelerates and accelerates And slows down when away from the sun Ver o Vedio in Pluto Much less than winter But from time to time, he likes Pluto with a strong summer Because of the tendency of the anonymous instinctive planet We know how the Arctic is changing And the southern part of Pluto over time The top representing the ball The circle of Pluto, is not stable as the Earth Our planet deviates with a angle of 23.5 degrees It has been solved for thousands of years Pluto less stable The cat changes over time Every few million years, Pluto spins on its side To reveal the northern half sunlight Continuous as it passes through the sun The heat of this change Earth's surface orbital change Imagine Hot Pluto Spread the atmosphere and is full of clouds Hot winds blow on the plains Plut neveo's snow begins to melt Like an animal out of hibernation Pluto comes back to life likely subject to such changes Rotating where it cools, heats, cools and heats In the past, and maybe in the future again Pluto covered with liquid on its surface, even if it is temporary? What would that mean? And how will this look? Eighty thousand years later Now, Pluto will wake up again He will turn completely to face the sun. The gypsum will be filled with the sound of nitrogen , You'll see rivers running on nitrogen You'll be on the shore of a lake of nitrogen There will be pink ice Organic molecules will come to you ! What a real magic world New Horizons "on the way" To seek new goals More surprises can come However, the legacy of this small probe goes much further than Pluto This changes the way we look at the frozen worlds in our galaxy And the potentiality of these distant worlds He tells us that there is a great platform for the game of life l na gal xia Many worlds, imagine a world. He's somewhere. This is a lesson that Pluto gives us He tells us things can be more exciting than you thought. , Pluto really inspired me Show me how much we can be wrong We thought by understanding what Pluto was was completely different As a scientist, you have to think How much we have to discover l This is exactly what Pluto taught us
