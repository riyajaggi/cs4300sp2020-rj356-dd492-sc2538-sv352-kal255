 When the sun sets, monsters appear in the square Some of the stars that you see are crazy And you're going to kill yourself. In the last decade, scientists have revealed that it is an evil aspect of our universe Deadly stars with tremendous destructive power We heard about death stars in movies But actually there ,,, solar systems are torn apart ,,, living worlds evaporate in a moment Somewhere on the porch, dozens were wiped out The worlds like us are the deadly stars Fear of darkness? You should be scared.

 Translated by: dr_sameh_nour yahoo, com How the Universe Works The stars are deadly June 2015 A small automatic telescope sweeps through the sky Over night in "Chile" in South America Explore the c u to automatically refresh yourself "or" Killer " It was programmed to monitor light flashes What indicates the death of giant stars He found the telescope that night He was never seen before The astronomers thought first, That he is a great next pilot But by analyzing the light, they discovered something incredible The explosive star was far away About four billion light-years And to see you from this incredible distance The flash of light must be unprecedented The highest bright speed in recorded history

 He radiated more energy than the sun In his life of 10 billion years But he did it in a few months. This is the greatest thing, this is the greatest brightness It can be done by the best scribe The scientists called the standard light explosion "The Biggest" Assassin 15L The name appropriate, because this a concise Very bright was a mass murderer This supernova will not destroy life On the planets orbiting this star But it will destroy life on millions of planets Millions of end-of-the-world events "The Destructive Force of" 15LH does not have much to do with explosive force Assassin's Assassin the light To understand how it causes great damage to brightness "The planetary scientist" Nina Lanza Maximize a famous family experience All light passing through this lens The mega centered at point l Maybe up to half an inch by inch ,,, When we prepare ,,, Flame flames with wood This incredible, lasted only a few seconds Light consists of small packets of energy called photons The more the photons are concentrated The increasing destructive effect There are more f tons here than we call them And this little place is the most beautiful of the area outside the lens Then, the glow ignites the fire with this wood "Radiant death in the experience" Nina Sunscreen thousands of times But the supernova was very bright, "LH" hundreds of billions of times Attack of highly focused photons So that the surface of nearby planets evaporates And take the covers of the worlds farther away A true collective killer of the planets Who knows, maybe some of the millions of worlds that were destroyed by the "15L" by civilizations like our civilization The death ray of the supernova The usual about thirty light-years We believe that ultraviolet radiation severe The supernova will destroy ozone on Earth If the Great Surfer Happened Within Thirty Light Years Super supernova super bright like "15L H" than the usual supernova So that the ray of death increases, perhaps Fifteen or even light years Imagine a stretch of space A thousand light years in all directions Taking hundreds of millions of stars Maybe billions of living worlds All we need is a larger ultra-bright mystery in the middle of this patch To completely erase life From that vast area humiliating to blow up a star One destroys the solar system But they are the real collective killers of the universe How can you become a giant star? For a mass murderer like "15L"? Astronomers have noticed dozens of Super Brightness Super Brightness But believe the secret of your training is in motion Super-bright supernovae begin their life They're like bright giants stars Known as giant giants blue stars These giant blue stars Huge live fast and die young Its fuel burns in only 10 million years When her heart dies, her body collapses The density called the n utron star If this neutron star was spinning fast enough enough it would have strong magnetic fields ,,, to transform it into something new and fiercer Magnetic star All stars of n utrons Strong magnetic fields But sometimes a monster is born There is a limit to the strength of the magnetic field Before you begin to separate time and space There is a magnetic star in this limit Stars like neutron stars taking stimulants Its strong magnetic field reaches the layers Extensive external gases of the dying star The heat increases and produces a strong emission of light But by brightness "Issued by" 15 LH You need a special kind of magnetic star The strongest magnetic star we have ever seen, and the fastest He directs the traditional magnetic star to the extreme Because you need a magnetic star With rotation of approximately one millisecond Which means that the star must rotate Neutron a thousand cycles per second And during the more explosion You have to take all the energy Rota o inside the star of n utrons And blast it to the next star To make the projector you see From the distance of billions of light years The 15L was the brightest The greatest scientists of the calamity have already seen Like a strong storm, it could be The biggest spicy wave we have ever seen H theoretically a maximum amount of energy What the supernova can generate This was at the end of this limit Luckily, great Ultra-shine twists are also extremely rare Impossible to see One of them explodes in our neighborhood soon But the gal xia timate and then Many murderers l Just as the light is mortal, the darkness is deadly with the same force. The supernova has many ways to kill you. The ultra-bright supernova can kill you with fire But it will kill you with snow The young blue stars are made, One of the brightest lights in the universe When you die in brilliant explosions Super Great Brightness the best example But other stars turn into super-luxuries as well Yellow stars swell like our sun as we age Turning into huge monsters Known as red giants The biggest of these brooding stars They are called giant red giants And the astronomers see it explode In fierce and super-tormented torments Whenever the giant red giant The explosion has intensified, but there is a problem Nobody saw a flash A giant red giant in our gal xia These old, old-fashioned stars The giant must be dying But if not in a flash of light, how? Scientists now impose an amazing theory Instead of blasting in a brighter supernova The huge red suddenly disappears Scientists have called these stars Weirdly dying with uncertainty A new guide suggests that these uncertainties The killers of cold-blooded planets can be You look at the sky and the sun Bright, and suddenly the sun comes out As soon as it seems It may be the biggest disaster in the history of the planet The life we ​​know has not survived. Scientists believe the key to disappearing Giant red giants the complete transformation of a flaming glow ball In a thick black hole Everything has to fit in a hurry The star can not spin fast Its outer layers will not expand much , When circumstances are appropriate It breaks into a black hole It essentially becomes a black hole Red Giants gets used to Huge to be a black hole when you die But they make more time to make a flash The violent light we see as the largest caliber But with the giant red giants Big block and very attractive in their hearts When it collapses, a photon does not escape. Light from the black hole, newborn The star disappears only in front of the observer The star dies without a flash like a crumbling star and forgetting to expand But when it collapses, it can not stretch Making a big attraction around this So that the explosion is not allowed even to escape No bursts, collapses into a black hole So, what makes planets of non-adventurer assassins? The huge red giants age rapidly And it dies only ten million years later But the astronomer thought "David Kiping" that the period enough These giant stars To create potentially live worlds The planets are formed quickly, they can form in a million years around these stars There must be enough time Mega stars make planets When we look at the remains of stars We find huge rocky planets around We tell our knowledge that those should The stars have worlds spinning around them Imagine a lonely rocky world warming you A distant light from a huge red giant star Simple Life Relates to Shallow Rock Ponds on the Surface of the Young Planet But his warm and warm life disappeared At the top of the c u, the giant sun burns The huge red other hydrogen fuel The force of gravity attracts Based on the integration of the drive And twenty thousand trillion tons of warm g s ,,, collapses to a point in space Black hole Surprisingly, the black hole that makes the damask Darkness does not put the planet at immediate risk These are the biggest ideas for wrong movies. The star suddenly becomes a black hole The planet is attracted by this But the attraction of the black hole is the same The gravity of the star, unless it misses mass From a distance, spin around the star How to spin around a black hole Nothing will change When the superstar collapses The scene of the distant planet will be imagined You will see your star in the sky and after a minute will disappear You're going to see him collapse in a black hole And everything falls and ends A slow, slow death will happen later. You are basically starving your star A passing moment, but the beginning of winter will not end If you suddenly switch off the sunshine Life will not die right away It will be like the night, colder than normal, but at the end For a period of weeks, months, or even years The planet will start to freeze The whole planet will be swept Ice age after 100 years First land, then oceans The oceans will freeze to a thick crust, perhaps there is little liquid water on the ocean floor Heating of volcanic vapors In the end, there will be only creatures. Do not rely on sunlight to live. , Tubular worms can live by fevers and fissures Water reservoirs in the ocean But they will not live forever. The planet will continue to heat The interior is scattered in space Surface heat will decrease Less 350 degrees Fahrenheit The atmosphere will collapse on the surface like ice It will not support the central geological activity of the planet All neighborhoods will disappear and the planet will die " You'll end up with these worlds Good for just snowballs Be dead in the light of the storm, the greatest or the darkness of rampant The planets are in reach of the deadly fire of the stars. But it is proposed to discuss the publication The stars can also be victims of murder Some ways of this murder are frank horror I am an old star on the way to death to acquire Once again the mass will become young again? He does exactly what the vampire does Life absorbed by something else In 2012, he held a Hubble telescope "terrifying space discovery" He encountered deadly stars that suck the lives of his neighbors These murderous vampires and geeks They lurk in crowded star clusters Known as clusters The stars generate a great interest of p and g s Such clouds have enough elements To form tens or hundreds of stars We call this family of stars stars clusters We believe they are all the same age Small clusters shine like a jewel The colors are bright, blue, yellow and red, But this spectrum of stars changes over time The blue stars disappear first largest cluster star, burns bright and dies after millions of years Followed by yellow stars, they leave The aging of these stars million Size over billions of years Gradually, it turns red like a ripening fruit After ten billion years, the whole cluster is ripe for deep red This gradual change in color is beneficial to astronomers Because it allows them to know the age of the cluster When you look at a group of stars in one place If you see many stars Zarqa is convinced that she is young Because they did not burn for a long time Because the blue stars are huge, soft stars They burn their fuel fast and live a short life But in the 1950s, the astronomers monitored something very mysterious in an old cluster Between the folds of the ancient red stars and the ba A group of bright blue stars Do not make new stars Within normally mature clusters How did she come there? The only explanation was that the Antique stars were somehow smaller in age Astronomers called the stars that challenged Old Astro Blue Stear We see some bunches of stars Blue seems too small for her Somehow isolated from the natural aging of the cluster Something is refreshing the star's youth But what does it do? If you imagine these stars Blue-eyed people in the crowd They appear to have undergone a face lift Masquerade as smaller stars though t o as large as any star in its vicinity "Believes astrophysics", Natalie Gosnell That the blue stars renewed them Hydrogen fuel more modern But where did it come from? In 2015, Natalie looked at the Hubble photos of "the set of blue stars" I found that most of the stars look young. She was in bilateral partnerships with the bodies of dead stars The g pareces appears to have been absorbed In movies, vampires in youth say they are sucking blood from humans In this case, we suck up G s stars and elements of other stars Making it small at all times The gas is the fuel that allows All stars are burned And with the new g s ,,, the renewed star ada But until the star turns into G s of vampire suck Scientists believe they need to start Their life is in a couple near the orbit If you have two stars spinning around, Both common in the universe They will not be the same block more times The bigger ones will develop faster As it ages and develops, it increases It swelled to its surface The attractive impact of Partner Star The youngest star becomes a vampire Absorbs the outer layer of gs Inflated from your major partner And when the vampire eats Burns and heats up more and more To become a bright blue baby The vampire's victim was completely absorbed To reduce the kernel of a dead star Astronomers know this as white But, like any good horror film, a story ,,, This murder something unexpected Bodies of explosives live There are many stories about living things What if the dead could return to the life and revenge of those who killed them? Similar things happen to the stars. When the blue stars age The stool is very swollen So that the dead white woman starts stealing Some g s again from the vampire The white woman lives again To become the body of a live explosive When this material accumulates It gets warmer And they accumulate huge amounts of hydrogen If it gets hot and the pressure increases a lot, it will become. Basically, a hydrogen-bomb of planetary size This star explodes These stars can take revenge When the living body explodes, it destroys The vampire that sucked life out of them The astronomers have been for decades afflicted by dead stars that are exploding in the night sky But here is our last possible explanation Our galaxy is full of vampires And live explosive bodies What does this mean for the rest of our galaxy? Many stars in our gal xia steal life From your friends to stay forever young The generator and death of vampires can be the reason for our vision of the blue veins today But it can also explain why we are here Life is bound to win In this universe without death In the find elements for the creation of planets or people or anything around us with little insight Vampires and living bodies are just parents. You can be the one-way gas flow product and return interstellar Vampire these binary systems For the Starbursts to spread Building units of life in the universe Our star - the sun - is not in a pair But if you think this protects us from Vampires of the universe rethink But new observations suggest that Vampires can go It just needs to be crossed nearby Our solar system will destroy the earth forever The universe spins like an hour Satellites revolve around the planets The planets rotate around the stars The stars themselves orbit around the middle of our galaxy Everything seems to be in place, orderly and stable But some deadly stars are against the rules From time to time, find something by jumping in the wrong direction How did the lost star come here? Scientists of the last decade have observed hundreds of stars The individual runs through our galaxy as a balistic missile Scientists have launched these electrolytes They travel at incredible speeds We talked about stars a thousand times faster than the rocket Anything super fast dangerous Superstar very dangerous A hot g mostras ball shows millions Mileage drips in our cosmic neighborhood You do not need fugitive stars For direct damage until damage occurs Even at the maximum extent of our system The sun has enough to destroy the Earth Do not want to approach a star Many of us under any circumstances Because this can disrupt the orbits of the planets The passing star does not have to come too close to cause serious damage We have a huge Ort cloud of comets Which takes two light years away from the sun If a star passes through l , we will be hit by devastating comets All the Planets in the Solar System Torn or Burned in the Star I do not expect the solar system to survive. Astronomers follow the tracks of fugitive stars They found that most came from the centers of galaxies In the middle of our galaxy, we see stars confined to orbit around a central black hole Like a circle like an angry hive These stars interact with each other sometimes, they are played by gal xia Most fugitive stars harmless to us Leaves the center of Hungarian But, from time to time, we see nearby fugitives In 2016, astronomers paid attention to the Shard star only 3,000 light-years away from Earth The path and composition of the star are illogical There is a star "SDSS C 1128", strange It's weird because it travels very fast through galaxy Faster than he could move if he were in orbit Something played with force But he also has something unusual a star like the sun, but there is a lot of it Carbon, that unusual Stars like the sun do not make Carbon just at the end of their life cycle When they swell to become red giants But he was a carbon-covered star where he should have To burn hydrogen at this point in his life What happened l ? Scientists believe the runaway star rich Carbon may have been a vampire before He is stuck in a close bilateral partnership Very fast with super-big star Vampire sucked the rich g s With carbon from his huge swollen partner But the superstar was a victim of resistance It burst into a vast and extensive torrent You should have done it. The explosion destroyed the vampire. But its orbital speed was optimal, it was played This carbon-rich star in space These were the stars One to the other very quickly When one of them exploded, he lost most of his mass very attractive He was not attracted enough to keep the star with the least mass They turned, one of them exploded The other saw himself exuberant outside the gal xia This explains everything The carbon obtained from the star with the largest mass The star exploded in a large block and ejected the star Small mass for high speed What are the chances that our planet burns A star that passes Vampire? ,,, in the space of our galaxy Our solar system is a small target It's rare to approach two stars Enough to do it Even over the billions of years he lives The star ,,, will not happen in the life of any specific star It is unlikely that it will be destroyed Vampire crosses the earth But there is another kind of mortal star There is a direct and present danger And we know he can beat us' cause he did it before March 2008 The astronomers were surprised when they saw Light erased by the c u, appeared suddenly And suddenly disappeared in less than a minute A rare occurrence of astronomers But a powerful reminder that our planet is connected Fireball the most powerful type of mortal star in the universe A supernatural weapon known as gamma-ray bursts Gamma rays, radiological weapons Csmica the strongest and most powerful weapon in the universe The gamma-ray emissions will not last For a long period of time, but deviated in two minutes But the energy released at this moment equivalent to 100 trillion nuclear weapons Each second goes through 100 billion years High-energy concentrated light beam And hit hard enough to evaporate nearby planets like the Great Torch, but more like a supernova The idea that instead of blowing a star ,,, to propagate the fruits in all directions What if it somehow exploded a direction instead of each direction? Somehow, it concentrates all the material thrown like a beam of the explosion The main idea here is that we're not talking about anything Explode as an axis and spread its energy in all directions The gamma ray burst is concentrated and takes all its energy and its point in us He is directly called to us, for this is very powerful A gamma-ray explosion in 2008 would collide The earth direct, but it comes from a great distance Where this superior weapon seemed to have lost its power Astronomers quickly calculated the origin of the beam They identified a location on the other side of the universe This cosmic bullet has remained Traveling through space for seven billion years Much more than our solar system We are talking about something high energy If you look at it with the naked eye To see it, although it is seven billion light-years away Can you imagine something? High energy and violent It seems to be a beautiful star in the sky Think about it for a second We have something very bright that can be seen with the naked eye Although it is about half the distance of the visible universe In 2008, we were lucky. If the same gamma-ray burst were erased A few thousand light-years distant To transform the surface of the Earth into a plasma But we're safe now These things happen somewhere in the universe every day Every day, I did not miss it here. Not every one or a thousand years, but every day Somewhere in the Balkans and in the hundreds of billions The galaxies that make up our universe There is a supernova that emits these explosions. It burns everything up within a few hundred light-years Where do the explosions that dissolve planets come from? And to what extent should we be concerned? What do you do to get a big star going fast? A huge star spins fast And burn all your nuclear energy Has a nucleus of year in the center This iron pulp becomes non-ferrous and stable and collapses into a star of n utrons If the neutron star turned quickly This means that if it turns a thousand times a second, it will have an enormous amount of cyclic energy This energy is concentrated when the star shrinks Strong magnetic fields of n utrons With nowhere else to go, it explodes Energy confined to the n estrelautron star's blades It makes an emission as Age of the toothpaste tube Emission can reach the star in all directions He prepares a magnetic bomb and then exports it Emissons that destroy the star in one direction To leave each pole, North pole and Antarctica And the amount of energy concentrated in these bundles makes them death rays These are the most powerful events occurring in the contemporary universe What is the probability of direct damage to the earth? The simple answer, I do not know The problem of bursts of gamma rays this dangerous place very far Maybe stars are about to make explosions Gamma rays are directed at us and we do not know about them We scan the c u and know The stars we think are serious We do not seem to look at the barrel of the gun. Maybe we'll be safe by now. We do not have to worry about the night To kill us with gamma-ray bursts But the universe is large and aged, and that means that strange things always happen We can destroy our solar system With a gamma ray burst in the future , But the universe spacious, we are small targets is likely to be in our favor However, he grabbed Silicon at another deadly assassin They think that this star is a bad guy The same killer who will destroy the earth at the end Now we know that our universe is full of deadly stars We know the existence of a planet Somewhere about to burn But even recently, our guide to this The Planetary Incubator was indirect We saw many stars of death Who burn the planets all the time We did not see any of these planets These stars destroy them only once Turned out to be a planet like Earth It was about a star much like the sun before 00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:49,596 "Astronomers Scouts" David Kiping "In statements by Kepler A telescope designed to monitor planets The Ministry of Foreign Affairs passes by its stars Your attention draws a white hand with an unusual digital print Instead of decreasing its light with a regular circular planet The small star appeared surrounded by rusty rocks and broken dust See from this white an Muitos Many decrease in their brightness Perhaps it would obscure up to 40% of the light In some periods of spacing, however everything in about five hours What is the rotation of things close to and in a clustered group? What can these aggregate groups be? too dense to be a group of asteroids And very close to your star to be comets Our best explanation was that it was not a planet Solo revolves around this white year But the miniature planets, perhaps the product of a destroyed planet The white an foi was caught in the act of killing his planet. a very close planet From this white year The forces of the seas were created The white anq that separates the planet Now we see fallow autumn On the surface of the white It was a good find, I mean, our expectation happened But to see direct evidence of the eye I mean, seeing an accident on the planet in front of you was Confirmation of something that we have long anticipated We just saw a star kill a planet. But scientists believe that crime This occurs throughout the universe If white people could destroy the planets That means ninety percent of the stars are capable of destroying planets There is no safe refuge for planets. also a bleak perspective for the future Our sun will start in a few billion General in transition for a white year Inflicts initially to swallow both planets Internal rocks of Mercury and Venus This means that the planets rotate in the sun Generally, we cross the void of space Something changes the way we move through the star But within the g s of the sun Many intensify this orbit This will displace the energy of the planets They will turn more and more to the star Our inflated star explodes its entire outer layers To leave a dense white an He reveals the burning earth in The orbit of death decreases to the sun If you get closer than white, you're lost. Because your rocky planet will be torn at the end The intense gravity of our white ani tightens On the burned remains of the inner planets A piece torn If the planet survived in the sun It is now near the surface of this white an Mercury will disappear first, rip The flower will rip In the end, the Earth will be eliminated , Maybe in a few billion years A space civilization will look at the sun The sun is no longer the bright star Huge, it is now a dead white an En They will observe the same planet The size of the earth revolves around it But the planet similar to the case with Kepler's data will end with your eyes They will ask if they have been in the past Civilization or life on this planet, the size of the Earth The star that gives us light today And heat, our planet will be shattered one day Our sun will become a deadly star But the atoms that are the planet All around us will return to the universe When our dead star gradually disappears New stars can be constituted by these relics The cycle of life and death can be restored in the universe It's sad to think of a star that kills planets. Because the stars are blowing life Our sun gives us life It's because of them. But it will also kill us at the end. Revive the stars and our deadlines Stars may look evil, but not life without death The cycle of the universe must rotate the right path to the universe
