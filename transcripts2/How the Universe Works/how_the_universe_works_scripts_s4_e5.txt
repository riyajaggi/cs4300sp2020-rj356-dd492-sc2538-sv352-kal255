 How the Universe Works (2010–…): Season 4, Episode 5 - Dawn of Life - full transcript 
 We're on the verge of unconvering the how life on Earth came to be. Our origin is a hotly contested scientific debate. Did we come from strange volcanic hatcheries deep under the sea? Or did life on Earth come from another planet?

 Look around you for life on Earth Then look at the sky Stars and planets, animals and plants Everything we see consists of the same material But how does this matter, those atoms I met to be? Are we the only living? Who ask this question? "The Ways of the Universe" , All we see in the universe See the same article follow the same rules The universe is made up

 ... of little basic ingredients Hydrogen, helium, lithium, carbon and so on All these chemicals, in varying degrees What are we And the same chemicals, in varying proportions Be it all Chemicals that make up galaxies and stars The same thing is amazing On the ground, and perhaps something unique , Become living beings Creatures can grow, multiply and think We are a conscious part of the universe I think this is ... a vital miracle You look at the sky And you know that you are connected In some way

 It's great When did the story of life start on Earth? In fact, I started before The land must be composed for a long time After the great explosion, the universe was only A huge cloud of hydrogen gas Then pressed pockets of gas cloud to be stars The stars alone can not convert hydrogen To more complex molecules that will become planets And flesh I think there is no way to make a life Of hydrogen You need other vehicles To give you a more complex chemical composition It was the beginning of life in Reality is the beginning of the first stars Perhaps after the Big Bang by half a billion years , Within the hearts of those first stars Heat and pressure Crushing hydrogen atoms together So strongly merge Helium atomizer It produces an explosion of energy Over time, atoms merge Helium also, to make carbon Nitrogen, oxygen and even heavier atoms Over hundreds of millions of years The older stars formed all the elements Which is our current solar system It contains atoms in your body But by doing so, you pay Those stars are a catastrophic price By draining its energy, the first stars will collapse Then explode in super-convulsions It spreads its star dust Chemically rich across space Iron in your blood And calcium in your teeth And in your bones, you formed In a much larger burst Maybe different stars that Exploded billions of years ago She has posted these materials in space around her We are not the product of a single star explosion But many starbursts The atoms in our left hands may have come from a star Different from the atoms of our right hands Carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and iron, are all The stars are only formed And the only way to reach here on earth The explosion of those stars and the integration of those elements later In our solar system , Bursting through space Those atoms are complex Inert gas withdrawals represent New Star Nurseries 4.6 billion years ago A certain cloud began to be squeezed by its attractiveness Our sun lit up Most of the old star dust has been absorbed by the sun He will not see again But the debris met together to be comets Asteroids and planets and then life Take it myself Games 00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,253 Rock is very complex I make things like iron, copper and manganese When you sit on the side of a mountain And a rock, they are also your relatives Thanks to the ancient great waves, the earth formed With all atoms required to form rocks and life But what distinguishes us About a piece of granite? There are basically three parts Major organisms A system or system must also occur Of chemical reactions extend your life to energy There must be a pod containing you Your internal equipment contains the external environment Thirdly, you must store a scheme Describe for yourselves ... three things , An energy source, and a protective pod And more manufacturing plans Of energy sources DNA is planned It is a long molecule, consisting of small units Called nucleotides DNA contains instructions on how to build Drive protein cell using Small molecules are called amino acids DNA also tells The cell is about the way fat is made A greasy molecule that is an ideal protective wound That's all You have the basic component of life Chemicals that The pave of life is very simple It is twenty amino acids They are nucleotide bases for making DNA and ribose acid Little fat, that's all Think of it as a lego game Where did those rules come from? Are you alive? In the 1950s , "The chemist" Stanley Miller He conducted an experiment to discover He filled a bunch of flasks Water vapor and volcanic gases to reshape Early Earth atmosphere Then he passed an electric spark through the mix To emulate lightning The result? Chicken fat was included One of the three building rules of life We found some amino acids Resulting from those experiments Some amino acids produced by life Before Miller's experience, he was supposed to That this kind of organic material can not , To come only from the living This is called membership Miller showed that it was not vital They produce as we expect from different places Because amino acids facilitate their synthesis The scientists wondered if they were the same molecules Which formed in the cloud of gas that formed the sun Before the sun is born If the theory is correct, the asteroids Wastes from that era of planetary formation Maybe still contain those The particles are so antique today This question has been answered In the 1960s When an older space rock fell from the ground "On" Murchison - Australia When you pick up parts of this The culprit Stinky like materials Organic volatile chemicals And when you analyze what it is We find a lot of amino acids Constructions of protein We found fatty molecules to be those wrappers Those membranes around all our cells We found the bases of DNA "Proved guilty" Murchison That the component parts of the cell The living is everywhere It was mixed when the earth was formed The Earth's young atmosphere makes more Organic building units continue to decline For millions of years after the crust had cooled The young earth is immersed in the structural units of life But gathering together needs a miracle The latest it? More than four billion years ago The young earth was land and oceans The modern moon appears in the sky the largest From today, raising the huge tide Which sweeps the land for miles Volcanoes throw hot stifling vapors To the atmosphere is very hot Above the fog Asteroids and comets continue to fall from the sky It was a time without oxygen in the atmosphere It was hotter because of radiative heating Backward from the growth of the earth The hottest collision of the underdeveloped earth It is a strange place of contention The land we see today However, life arose there If we want to search for the origins of life on Earth We have to put that in our minds Scientists are studying today Earth's most precious environments to understand how life existed On the surface of our young planet The land was not young Continental land as we see it in the land today But it's like an archipelago of volcanic islands There was a tide that swept the land for miles Then the back of it will recede Much like the features we see here With rocky pools of warm steam water Some scientists believe that life began In those warm rock pools Each time the tide recedes The lagging water evaporates It concentrates the structural units of life Inside ponds push these organic molecules For interaction "In this geothermal location in Iceland" A similar process concentrates metals In a thick white paste One of the most important types of chemicals Which may have focused on those Volcanic rock pools on the ground For the origins of life on Earth Are fat molecules, very fatty molecules She was able to accomplish intelligent work It is naturally self-assembly On the young earth, individual fat molecules Free surf in the ocean But were confined together in rocky ponds Those fatty particles gathered together to be bubbles This is important for the origin of life Because they are the outer membrane For all cells, all living quarters are on earth To show you what I mean, I can use Fishing hooks here These hooks have an end to water resistance The end you like water, like the fat molecule completely To see what happens No matter how you go, you will naturally Guided by the end of the adhesive The end will remain in the water And we can see it coming together Fatty particles were injected into each other Such as oil droplets on the water surface To be thin membrane No matter what the dry water touched The layers will have been submerged in the volcanic rocks Oil bubbles These rocks have a spongy property If these molecules formed Fatty acids naturally into those layers And bubbles, and these vesicles are embedded in rocks You have basically made primary cells The primary cell now has its fatty sac Other molecules such as amino acids and nucleotides Will be paid within when the rocky pools evaporate These simple structural units may have united To be protein and DNA Maybe it was an excellent environment To focus things There is water, but there is an opportunity for things to sink Together in shallow pools, where Molecules can be reacted Treina Rocky ponds were how easy things were For organic cell systems until they accumulate But as a place to start life The surface of the earth was a major obstacle The land was being bombed UV radiation Of the sun, a thousand times stronger than it is today This powerful radiation quickly destroyed Any nucleic acid may be in shallow rock ponds Life seems to need to be made up in the shadows Away from this attack of ultraviolet radiation But you still need life The first is a steady supply of energy So start Though not sunlight What is it? The basic unit of life is the cell To understand how it works Imagine it is an industrial city The micro-structures inside the cell act like factories You take raw elements and transform them For more complex forms such as devices Which are building new cells And as the city Cells also want to produce energy To maintain the functioning of the industrial units Some scientists believe that the key to the origin of life Disappear in the way of life In the manufacture and use of energy It's all about energy Energy is what drives complexity and sophistication In technology We see it in human history We have progressed and complicated In the story of life Today, the cells have Complex bioenergy plants built into them These structures help guide chemical energy Inside and outside the cell membrane This chemical flow is provided Cell powered in the end But the primary cells did not have a luxury Complex system to generate their own chemical flow The energy from the sun will be very large In contrast, scientists believe that life must begin In a shaded chemical card spot Already moving In the 1970s, scientists began Bold mission under the sea To a long volcanic fault at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean They were amazed to discover Long structures like chimneys Pour hot volcanic water And amazement These structures were wrapped in life People really amazed when we discovered it They were environmental systems, an oasis of life gathered , Around those black spaces Deep in the water by miles In the sea where sunlight never reaches Before the discovery of those ships No one knew of life without light But here are organisms that thrive on chemical energy Which emanates directly from the seabed Then scientists began to question If that is chemical energy It is itself that spark the spark of life But there was a big problem Those discovered It was too hot to be the origin of life , Then in 2000 Scientists working west of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge nine miles They discovered a new kind of cooler They called alkaline vapors Depending on their unique chemical condition ... what we discovered by these alkaline spaces This warm water is rich With minerals emanating from the seabed They blend and interact ... with cold water around It precipitates solid metals and builds This chimney is vast, towering towers The heat inside these towers They were suitable for aggregating organic molecules For more complex forms But do these structures have remarkable energy Need to turn a simple chemistry into a life? "Laurie Barge," a NASA team, Which incubates an alkaline competitor We start the lab by testing What happens specifically in the minarets In the young land We have to take into consideration the conditions Initial atmosphere, first ocean The type of ocean crust and interactions Which were occurring Laurie begins by injecting alkaline fluids In what mimics the initial Earth's circumference The ocean here contains iron as it was On the young earth, and the chimney you see Is the deposit that is in existence They are replaced by two variables A thin chimney grows inside the flask Because this structure is alkaline It reacts with the acidic water around it It draws chemical energy into the chimney walls This chemical flow is similar to flow Which is generated by living cells today But energy and heat are not the only ones Which are shared by those ships Alkaline with live cells Exciting about these alkaline vapors That pockets and pores Channels and cracks that we found Its way through these structures These chimneys are the same size as the cells On the young earth, these fine pockets She supplied a warm crucible For the meeting of the three basic units of life Chemical energy flowing through chimney walls It may have enhanced micro-metabolic drives Within those primary cells After millions of years, the primary cells By developing a way to synthesize energy for itself Then it can be liberated For the first time in history Chemistry becomes life Alkaline diffusers are the main theory of the origin of life But is it possible that those Simple cells have faced competition , From another form of life - a more sophisticated cell - came to earth three hundred fifty 00:21:45,924 --> 00:21:48,595 Full of being from another planet? Can our ancestors be spacemen? This is the land after that The crust has cooled by half a billion years The climate is warm and humid The asteroids have done Bringing in the structural units of life It is from the deep past Some simple forms of life may have continued But perhaps it is not life that turned us Because the earth is about to be bombed With another wave of asteroids "It assumes a radical theory called" universal cunning That some of those space rocks Filled with space life "So the" universal cunning Is the idea of ??the emergence of life on On a planetary particle or other environment and come to Earth And brought them drooping fallow ... I do not know, but I think That the idea of ??playing mass cunning plays a role There must be a lot of evidence We went to this direction The argument began to vanish massively with a game Cosmic Pinball 4.1 billion years ago The outer planets of the solar system Not yet settled in fixed orbits They are contending for their positions Atomic fuzzy falling dust Sends a barrage of giant asteroids Towards the Earth "Called" heavy shelling late What we bite around the sun is happy Except the outer planets were thrown These are huge objects on us They still come again and again There were asteroids and giant comets pouring down On the ground, sometimes causing the ocean to boil  If weak creatures arose In the first oceans The late heavy shelling wiped them out But the land was not The only planet in the range of fire Mars asteroids also hit At that time Mars was a different planet Mars is smaller than Earth Faster refund It had a dense atmosphere and ocean of water Before being made up in the ground With a previous evolutionary beginning A bacterial life may have arisen on Mars At that point, perhaps Live deep in the surface rocks We saw life on the ground hidden inside the rocks They hide in those rocks And to avoid radiation and the harsh environment By hiding and thriving within this surface A huge collision on the surface of Mars Perhaps he threw rocks full of bacteria in space These completed creatures are ready for air transport Imagine one of them confined to a rock It was tossed out of a planet, flying through space And landing after thousands of years on a different world Open burst, managed to breed and grow So did a Martian rock Sowing life on earth Near the end of the heavy shelling late? It is an amazing possibility But how did Martian beings survive the long journey Across space NASA engineer Mojiga Cooper knows the extent of bearing Bacteria, because their function killed her So do not make super bacteria from the ground Spread through the space missions of other planets If we sent a spacecraft and it was covered with bacteria They are likely to multiply in that environment We are bacteriologists In the ideal case, we would like to have each part Of sterile machines The reason for this caution The exotic ability of bacteria to live in space Some bacteria on the ground When faced with a strong environment "They begin to form what we call" spores And spores, if you imagine a seed All genetic information in the middle And is protected by many defensive layers It encapsulates itself in space vehicles Allowing them to live in space You can take a bog and play Put it in space and then prepare it It will remain viable Spores allow for bacteria To remain alive in a state of inertia For a very long time The record on the ground was a bog Before the era of dinosaurs He was brought back to life recently After a nap of 250 million years Spores can live theoretically For millions and millions of years But seeing a guide to the re-life of Bog It is amazing The last obstacle to universal prominence Is the fiery contact on the earth's surface Planetary scientists simulate Violent collision events With high-speed guns Can the Martian bacteria To survive Not every part of the extruded was destroyed And collided strongly in the collision , When we do those experiments We usually find small parts Of the remnants of the projectile in the collision chamber If there were bacteria You live in this part of that rock They can survive the collision on the planet Science shows us that universal cunning is possible But it brings us closer to understanding Origins of life? The basic problem with mass caving It removes a step from the problem And place it elsewhere We do not know how life came to life on earth They seem to have originated on Mars But we do not know how it originated on Mars So you have this basic problem, which is How did life begin? Many people say you should not take the crap In mind, because it moves the question to another place But this may be important Because then you will say we need two planets ... to form what we see on Earth Planet to its origin and a planet to carry it away Did our ancestors come from space? Or did they originate from the Earth's oceans? What we know for sure is that the next stage Of their journey is full of dangers Because even life becomes intelligent You must face the loss first Our planet is full With a great variety of neighborhoods , There is plant life and animal life ...simple life And intelligent complex life like us However, every creature on earth He can track his family tree To the same small cell Which lived billions of years ago All neighborhoods on Earth are interrelated We share 50% Of our DNA with bananas I mean we are completely different from bananas But when you look at her heart The shape of its DNA, they are almost identical DNA is the operating system of life It stores the program that tells the cells How to form complex structures And how energy is generated In the end, how to make a similar copy of it , When we look at life We tend to focus on Installed .. This is important It is composed of acids Amino acids and molecules, and so on But the main difference between Life and simple chemistry Is the content of the information So using computer terminology It is not the amazing hard plug of the computer It's programs The greatest property of DNA His ability to change Over billions of years, have made little "mistakes" In DNA synthesis Led to the tremendous diversity we see today for life These mutations can occur When the DNA is damaged The incomplete part is tampered with Usually to a full copy But from time to time, set Different from nucleotides Slide in place Sometimes, asymmetry occurs, and those mutations , Sometimes harmful But may be useful sometimes Sometimes it may make you a simple change To treat food better, maybe make your own Better, makes you a better fisherman It may make you taller You can see the grass better These changes are useful, and they are random It does not happen much, but it does This basically led to what we are now Of all the mutations that led to human life The most important of which is also one of the first Is the leap of simple mono-cell life To complex multicellular life It is hard to imagine without multicellularity That intelligence is possible The creature must be great Enough enough to specialize So that some cells are .. some parts This creature, you can Focus on being a brain Jumping from simple life to complex Began about 2.4 billion years ago What was the excitement behind this radical change? ... Scientists put it back to a radical mutation Photosynthesis "What happened was a mistake Mutation led to great power The first object develops this superpower Blue bacteria are called Turns green and can use sunlight To make her increase For the first time, it became life Its internal source of energy Wherever you are, when it is There is sunlight, you have food You can rest and be free And begin to branch In terrestrial environments Blue bacteria thrived But photosynthetic residues are oxygen Very toxic gas for most other primitive life Weapons of mass destruction At that point, there was not Free oxygen in the atmosphere It was the first time that this happened When those beings arose and flourished I began to immerse this toxin into the atmosphere Most of the life on Earth is killed by oxygen But the creatures that survived Developed to use oxygen And promote their development Oxygen is very dangerous because it is easy to interact But this made him very good fuel So the proportion is meager Of the living that he did not kill The toxic gas, oxygen, suddenly multiplied It had enough fuel to use And more energy , Means more complex molecules , And more complex chemistry And a more complex biological complex That means the ability of those Creatures to evolve faster With oxygen support, some monocytes have evolved Do something you have not done before I met together They were microorganisms Mono cell is smart enough When I realized how they were together Because it enabled them to protect themselves It acts as a community Different cells within these communities I started to specialize in different tasks In the end, communities started to work As one creature ... the stage is ripe for the next superpower Multicellular organisms But the second world catastrophe is imminent Away from attention, blue bacteria Its numbers are still exploding When oxygen is released it grows It will change the chemistry of the whole planet When oxygen filled the air He interacted with the first atmosphere Remove greenhouse gases such as methane The result? Rapid cooling of the Earth's climate We believe this will make a climate The planet is very cold A frozen world, what we call snowball Perhaps the first climatic disaster Which occurred after the emergence of life on earth The snowball lasted 200 million years In the end, the volcanoes To release enough greenhouse gases To restore the climate to its condition The surviving creatures inherited A warm world rich in oxygen Ideal for multicellular organisms Multichannel thrived And coincided with increased oxygen Over the next five hundred million years Oxygen levels continue Rise, and used by neighborhoods To grow in size and complexity Most animal groups have evolved The main thing we see today The fish turned into reptiles The reptiles turned into mammals Then small to the mains In the end, two hundred million years ago The first man on earth We exist because life The first I learned to generate oxygen What this means for smart advanced life Elsewhere in the universe? What planets are likely to have around other stars Oxygen that drives advanced development? We're going to know that Scientists are closer than ever before From revealing the story of life on earth If we thought of the main milestones of evolution ... not many, but I will prepare three ,the origin of life The onset of complex life is associated with oxygen And the emergence of smart life These are all For me, this is the story of life on earth It then became complex and smart Now we want to know If it is the same process of evolution Has occurred elsewhere I became more confident Over the past few decades That life is everywhere in the universe Is there a smart life? Is this a more difficult question? How to answer it Considering the key factors that have helped our development We see if they exist elsewhere Examine the light from distant dust clouds Astronomers now realize that the structural units of life , Common across the galaxy They monitored more than a thousand potential planet Earths Around the nearby stars At least the primary stage of life Looks unlimited But for complex multicellular life ... you need something else Oxygen rich atmosphere Is there oxygen in those worlds? This is the question that I want to live to see his answer If yes, that's amazing This is an important leap in our understanding For life in the universe NASA is developing a new generation of telescopes To search for planets around nearby stars And search for oxygen-rich air packs But a recent surprise from a nearby planet Assume that the worlds are rich in oxygen May be more common than we think I think we can do it here  "Nina Lanza is working with NASA "On the Mars Vehicle" Keriocyte Interested in a mysterious black layer They seem to exist on Mars and Earth This is great, thanks What we see here is called rock painting This is a cover on the surface of the rock Rich in manganese oxides All living cells use manganese These are black sediments On the ground believed to have formed When the metal was released from dead bacteria And reacted with oxygen in the air Nina wanted to understand the chemical structure Similar to Mars So in 2014, she wanted "From the vehicle" Keriocyte To dissolve a group of dark rocks The laser beam has an analytical cutter When the rocks melt They evaporate a little material If we continue guidance On the rock in the same place We can detect the installation Cover if there was anything There was a large protrusion sample We noticed them immediately We looked as if we were wrong We have to check that data to make sure we are We did not miss it It was not wrong, I have , We looked at the initial evidence We have re-examined it and are still there A huge amount of manganese The sudden result indicates Life may have thrived on Mars rocks Inside an atmosphere rich in oxygen Even if manganese deposition On Mars by geology You still need dyes Dark to atmospheric oxygen To anchor them in the rocks So find the casing Like this on Mars, or even a layer Composed of a similar configuration Opens the possibility of oxygen In the atmosphere of Mars sometime in the past Mars lost its atmosphere billions of years ago But the possibility of having oxygen in the past Great, because if there were two planets In the same solar system and possess The main components of life And oxygen to develop a complex life The odds are not Our existence is alone in the universe Rise strongly When we look at the story of life The universe seems to have started with hydrogen Now he is finished with intelligent human beings This is a great story Are we the only chapter in the book? this is the question Whether there is a person In a remote place in the galaxy ... He has the same thoughts or not I'm not sure Hard to say no, because the universe is roomy We are a group of atoms that you understand It's a group of atoms, that's amazing The universe knows that it is the universe So I think it's important to know How can this be done I have a bottle of Champagne Cool in my fridge I think we will discover the evidence of life On other planets in my life I'm ready to celebrate
