 How do you not like the black hole? It's all over It deflects space, and distorts time There are some opinions that if you fell into one Will appear elsewhere in the universe It is the inspiration of the science fiction writer , And we consider those things to be true So that we notice thousands of them constantly , Giant black holes Giants are already among us And will not stop raising them What we will see If we see this giant eye view? I would like to tour around a black hole Look out the window

 Look at this scary black disc in front of me and marvel Of the perceptual deviations of light See the amazing features For all the things that you have Calculating them without ever seeing them What we will discover If we went inside a black hole? We send a default probe To a super black hole Greatness in the center of the Milky Way "Known as the Star" Our destination is very far away So if we traveled at the speed of light The journey will take 26,000 years , On our journey across the galaxy We will pass tens of thousands of other black holes We believe there are different sizes for black holes There are microscopic black holes in the microscope There are medium black holes formed When the stars collapsed Maybe the last stars fell out There are large black holes They are hidden in the centers of galaxies Most black holes begin their lives With the death of a huge star When a star collapses, it explodes ... in the most violent explosions in the universe , Supernova .. star explosion Which shines briefly With a force of ten billion stars Gravity takes over the star's core The star is crushing itself by gravity But the pressure of light stops him Emitted from it If the star stops issuing this light He will crush himself He gets smaller, younger and younger So power can not keep it And crush on himself Gravity attracts every atom inside To make the iron mass "Everest Steel Size" Applies to the grain size of sand You may think that solids being solid They are so powerful that they do not squeeze any more Think of iron But in fact, most of the iron vacuum The space between protons and neutrons At the core of the iron atom is very large , So at some point, for some stars The pressure is very high So that it ends up crushing This pulp .. Nitrons and protons together What happens next is mysterious Gravity crushes these Subatomic particles together In ways that science can not explain What inside the crushed star can not imagine Games 00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,894 There are temperatures and pressures We can not even measure them , We know the fact that we need a new physics Things we have not yet discovered To explain what is going on inside the black hole The huge star collapses So that it becomes a small part of its former size But the original gravity of the star remains To create a strong attraction that does not escape anything The result is a black hole Most black holes are larger Of our sun from ten to twenty times , But at the center of galaxies Black holes may be billions of times larger These Giants are more than just huge objects It is super large The best word in astronomy Is a super black hole , As you see from the name This black hole is too big Consumes a super-large amount of material We know of one In the center of our Milky Way galaxy Our default probe is approaching "Towards the super black hole" Rami - A. The super large black holes swallow anything They eat gases But if a star approached them , It will also be distracted Or devour a planet or spacecraft Whatever it is, it does not check anything She even eats some of them But over billions of years Many stars die in one area The resulting black holes converge And merge into larger black holes The star "Rami - A" is evil and eats his sex He devours all that is within reach For at least twelve billion years The reason behind the black hole capacity For all these enormous amounts of material that he charged Because it is like the dirtiest compressor for rubbish It crushes the material into tiny sizes So the weight of the black hole is total All that he has been accused of since the beginning of our universe After billions of years of acculturation "Weight the mass of the star" Rami a The mass of the sun was estimated at 4.6 million times But all this bloc is in a region Show the sun only twenty times Surrounded by a mantle of stars, dust and gases Approaching the black hole Something strange happens to the probe So far he has followed a straight path But his path is now beginning to bend From the perspective of the probe Nothing strange happens But if you're outside, look at the probe The straight path is no longer straight The straight path was attracted In real place around the black hole The SIP path has not changed But the place around him has not changed When the place changes, time changes Time passes differently When approaching the black hole If the black hole was rotating He pulls the place around him to be with him It's strange It changes all our beliefs about sense and intuition And everything, and shoot them all The star "Rami A" is a distortion of space and time When the probe approaches, time rotates So science fiction is achieved At the black hole The probe can travel to the future When approaching Of the supermassive black hole in the heart of our galaxy And the scepter shall fall at the mercy One of the foundations of forces in the universe Power possesses the ability to fold the place And send the probe to travel over time Gravity is a familiar thing We usually drop things Otdron, we do not fly away from the surface of the earth It is part of our lives from the moment of our birth But it turned out to be very vague and authentic Of the universe When the particle has a mass He has the ability to place me "Before Einstein's Theory of General Relativity Imagine space scientists Background of a theater in which events take place She was the genius of "Einstein" in the realization That space itself was represented in the play We think the place Is the particles around us But it is something in itself It has its own physical component Such as the fabric, such as the page In the vacuum Light travels in straight lines But put something as big as our sun On the fabric of space Its enormous attractiveness slows down When light travels through the sun Bend his straight path So bend the light .. not to his property But because the space in which light travels is bent For this the path of our probe bends The gravity of the black hole folds the texture of space Everything that travels across this curved space He must bend his path, even the light Amazing The gravity does not fold the light and according to the black hole But the light coming from afar also bends toward him So you can see this slanting twist Stars off in the background When the black hole moves in front It's as if you took a piece of glass You moved it through a star field And not the place alone What folds the black hole Time also involves So if we send a probe into a black hole From our point of view, we will see it fall inside And we will see him fall slowly Because his watch is moving slow It's a strange idea It is hard to contain our minds But this is what physics and mathematics dictate We appreciate time in hours, minutes and seconds Sounds simple But the time is relative It varies depending on your location It seems to my readers that this shot Picture of the moment in time and moment in place But it really is not a moment In place or moment in time They spread in place Because there is depth in the rear domain But they also spread in time Because the light from the white background behind me Left the background earlier From leaving light from my face , So when you see a picture You will actually see something Spread in place and time So when gravity turns the place around It also changes time The amount of gravity you face varies Time also changes Time does not pass at the same rate Everywhere in the attractive field The more it deepens in gravity The time slowed Today we have high-precision watches Tell us about time differences Between being in the basement and being in the attic That's true Time in the attic is faster From it in the cellar "If I spent a day at the top of Empire Estate It will be a few years older than a billionth of a second Who stayed on the ground floor This is because the time passes slower Near the mass of the Earth where gravity is stronger The more gravity the slower the time The presence of mass and energy in space swims space So I spit the space-time around me With larger and larger particles This bending increases more and more So the earth slows space-time The sun slows space-time When it reaches the black holes The bending is too large very big So that the probe is transmitted over time It's hard to take it This idea about space-time and even about black holes It is very crazy If approached a black hole A visual meeting was held with my mother on the computer ... Vstrani move Hello mother But I will feel My time passes naturally While acting ... Strangely, she says, "My God You speak strangely If you approach the black hole You can go back to the future If you return, people will say that you are full of youth It was a holiday for young people "I will answer" because because my time was slower As our probe approaches more towards the black hole Gravity grip increases The time slows, while the probe And the flow of materials that accelerate within it They remain accelerating until they gather "In a vast, luminous circle called the supplied disk Gravity sends all these materials Directly into a huge cosmopolitan bank But something goes against gravity It is a card power enough to overcome On the strongest gravity in the galaxy The probe is attracted towards Hurricane of time and place twisted Between our probe and the black hole A global killing zone It is a disc of dust and dissolved gases ... with tens of millions of miles And threaten to tear the probe apart You have that article falling in the black hole Be a disc, and there is friction inside this disc Things are under control The speeds are very large So that the disk becomes very hot And when the heat hits it However, the black holes are dark When materials fall, they can light up And become the most beautiful particles we see in the universe While the probe falls To this hard disk of materials Something strange happens Do not tear or fall to the abyss In contrast, the probe joins the rotor material disc It revolves around the black hole What forces prevent this article To be swallowed by the black hole? Almost everything in the universe Turns in one way or another "This is because of" angular momentum This tendency when you run something It remains circular When you consider this traditional example , For skiers spinning on the skating rink And when she pulls her arm They start spinning faster and faster Think about what happens when Turns out of a huge star To a small, high-pressure black hole This gyro is very accelerated When the material falls inside the black hole It will launch faster and faster To reach astronomical velocities Travel near the speed of light The material rotates at high speed Do not drop it directly towards the black hole For example, there A popular ride in the celebrations Where they are in a room, and start rotating You are pushed off the walls and down the ground But remain above without slipping The same effect prevents you To be located in the black hole If you run something very quickly The centrifugal force overcomes gravity There is an opposing effort Between gravity try to crush things Centrifugal force for rotation Trying to keep things away But the black hole does not work on The rotation of materials around him only He runs the place around him Imagine the dirt vortex Dust revolves reveals Unseen wind movement In the same vein Materials circulating around the black hole Reveal an invisible movement of indigestion When the black hole rotates It makes a storm of space-time The black holes are strange no matter how you look at them Everything about her is strange But I think the strangest thing about it is true It can attract time And the place, this fabric around Enveloping itself in a mantle of the same universe material Tell us general relativity That is a huge rotary particle, even the earth It must move the space-time around it "In a process called" frame rate slowdown When we go back to a situation now The excessive gravity of the black hole "When we talk about" slowing the frame of reference We are talking about an area Where the place is strongly attracted So that stability there is impossible Our default probe three hundred fifty 00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:58,240 Spins across a plethora of spacetime Things look oblique and folded I mean what you see before you He is really behind you Most of us thought about what was there May be destroyed Rotate firmly, extrude material They are not black holes With horrible monsters in science fiction Which devour everything approaching it The truth is that the black holes Eat up as children It's chaotic When materials fall into it, many of them He can not even get into the black hole Physicists appreciate That about forty percent of the dust and gases In the supplied disc, never insert the black hole Do not destroy unless you are Inside the black hole already But if I were outside the black hole slightly I was spinning fast enough Will live like this for a long time Interconnectedness between rotation and gravity The probe may hang here forever He is destined to see the hollow face of the black hole He never knows what lies behind him But gradually, gravity wins The probe is attracted close to the edge of destruction To a place where time stops A firewall threatens to erase everything Our probe is on the ledge ... is about to enter the empty mouth of the black hole Horizon event The black holes have a so-called horizon event It is a point of no escape Of the tensile tension of the black hole When to cross the horizon of the event As if you crossed the edge of a waterfall No room for return If you look at this waterfall, you will feel like a straight one .. And suddenly at the edge The water descends vertically downward The edge of the black hole is almost like that When the event horizon, space begins Suddenly bending strongly into the inside Gravity attracts water Cross the ledge and drop the water down the same way Which attracts time and space across the horizon of the event Into the black hole The fish are also present in the water Everything is in space-time Including light So if a simple light beam falls on a horizon it happens A black hole can not come back again The only way to escape by overcoming gravity For water to climb the waterfall Or light to escape from the black hole He must travel quickly enough To overcome gravity The stronger the gravity Particles needed to travel more quickly To escape the gravity of the earth The rocket must travel Quickly seven miles per second From our largest and farthest sun The escape speed rises to about 384 miles per second Black holes have attractive fields Much more powerful than that In fact, no matter how fast the rocket leapt Even the speed of light will not go away In the few remaining seconds Before the probe sinks into the abyss Pull gravity and fold it to the flask It goes beyond description Assuming I have an hour The probe has an hour I can observe the hour of the probe and my watch When the probe approaches more and more Horizon Black hole event I will notice that the probe clock has stopped When the event horizon completely The time stops completely If I were sitting On the event horizon of the black hole ... or has almost, you look at I will look frozen with you You will not notice a thing Falling into the horizon of the event from the outside Because it will take longer Of the entire universe For us even note the disappearance of the particle The absolute gravity of the black hole is distorted Place, time and light When you fall into the black hole Syrac people are sliding towards the red They will see your light lose its energy Because he needs to get out of these Deep hole of gravity To escape from the black hole We face the same phenomenon with sound When the fire truck speeds up To us, the sound waves are compressed And when you move away, it goes Like the sound, the light travels in waves But instead of changing the tone The waves of light will change color Exit the attraction of the black hole The waves of light bend and lose energy and turn red That's why the black holes look different As a science fiction material But the real universe is stranger than science fiction This is very cool And the finest We do not know exactly what is going on At the horizon of the black hole event Einstein's Theory of General Relativity Predicts that the probe will simply slide towards the horizon of the event So if this probe passes through the horizon of the event There will be no mention "Welcome to the Horizon of the Event" He will not notice anything different You will cross this limit and suddenly quarantine About the universe, without ever returning This is tough But according to a completely new theory Our probe will not fall to the bottom Light free fall It will be washed with fire In a large cosmic wall Supposed to be a computer firewall To be a barrier While the firewall The black hole is literally a firewall This means that the situation is not easy near the horizon of the event Space is not alone with a few photons What you will understand alone On the contrary, there will be a torrent Radiation of photons This new theory turns the horizon of the event To the most dangerous place in the universe He burns whatever he touches In Seir of Infinite Energy There is no doubt that there is space in space The horizon of the event - nothing comes out of it - But the most important question What happens if you fall Some believe that nothing special happened Others believe you are burning With this firewall And puzzling about this If you wanted knowledge I decided to fall into the black hole You will know without telling anyone else What frustrates the black holes are there Horizon event, we know that light can not be emitted Skip this threshold, even With all our advanced facilities It's hard to tell To photograph what is happening In the horizon of the remote event "For the star" Rami a We will need to build a telescope the size of the earth It seems impossible but it is formed "At the Mona Kia Observatory in Hawaii If you want to see the black hole in the center of the galaxy You will need a very large seat We can not build an optical telescope of this size What we do is use radio telescopes We distribute these approaches Thousands of miles from each other So we make a chair The size of the earth itself All of them converge here And within this fund All our signals come at 8 Gbps This equates to four digital movies per second If we promise to send them quickly your home internet It will take years To send all this data So what we do we pack We ship it to our central factory at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Where we process data It is necessarily a very special place It is the gathering point It is the place where all data converge The accumulated data may be highlighted On the horizon of the event in two or three years So when a telescope gets a horizon Event on its final statements We hope to be a picture of something like that That's what we're prepared to see Because the gases are intertwined in the center of our galaxy It will make the picture blurry But if we remove the bluff We will be able to recover shadow properties This is what we are going through It is the summary of the event horizon telescope It is a black ball with a width of 17 million miles Nearby, our probe will see this In the final moments before he enters the abyss If there was a firewall Disappears behind this black curtain Our trip will end here Otherwise the probe will slide Simply through the point of no return To enter the most violent place in the universe Where new worlds begin The past is now present Our probe survived the whirlwind of space-time It is now inside a super black hole Driven towards a world of unimaginable violence He can never leave Everything that falls in the black hole disappears And since he never comes out "The question is" Where to go? Gravity here is enormous So that the place accelerates beyond the speed of light At this speed Journey eight million miles to the center of the black hole ... It will take less than forty seconds If the probe survived this period Imagine that I fell into a black hole The force of gravity will be different If I fell on my feet first Because of the great curvature in space-time there Because of this, the feet will have a stronger grip It will be stretched to a shape More like Spaghetti pasta So we call it macroscopic influences The effects of macaroni are real We saw her talk when she made an attraction Jupiter with macroscopic effect On the comet "Schumaker Levy 9 "to convert it to Nathair in 1994 In fact, our probe may tear apart Before reaching the center of the black hole Of course I can revive myself and do it But as you know The laws of physics are what we are fighting with here To disrupt those laws We allow our speculators to continue It is halfway to the center of the black hole From this monitoring site The probe sees everything that is in front of it If you were talking about the exact mathematical horizon You will see the past of the whole universe as a past You'll see a start Composition of the black hole "According to Einstein's rates." The Black Hole is a giant cosmic museum All the light that has fallen since the formation of the black hole Still here, accelerating and accumulating in layers While the probe deepens Huya, the battle between Gravity and rotation resume and rage Centrifugal force is becoming relatively stronger Inside the depth of the black hole This force slows the flow of space And where it slows down to the speed of light The inner horizon is called All the strange things happen on the inner horizon In this mixed cosmic mixer The material rotates and rushes around the probe If you jumped into a huge black hole As if it had fallen into a waterfall You will be alive and well And you are on your way down Problems come only when you arrive at the corresponding The inner horizon, at the bottom When other water falls and the rocks and things are on you Inside the depth of the black hole The probe reaches the inner horizon The internal horizons of rotating black holes It is the most violent part of the universe Particles full of energy Hit the probe at almost the speed of light Black hole, amazing type of particle accelerator In the inner horizon The particles are tossed in all directions Are accelerated through each other Collide together Exporting huge amounts of energy Which exceed any energy In any ground accelerator of particles Those collisions have the power to launch The most violent events in the universe If there was a place in our universe Where we make our universe a newborn Where our universe is born I confirm that this place Is the internal prospects of black holes Because it is the place Where the energies needed to make a great explosion They are produced there Is the great explosion that made our universe Such an event? Will we be inside a black hole? It is quite possible that our explosion is great Is the remains of a black hole in an existing universe Crushes things together Then it poses our universe as a child One of the reasons why holes The black crap is amazing For the theoretical physicists they have guided us For a new understanding of the universe So if we understand black holes Perhaps we understand the great explosion If we understood the Big Bang We may understand our origins first When the probe crosses the inner horizon Everything changes Pull the gravity of the probe inside Equal to the rotation that he pays out The opposing forces are finally in exchange What he does in the center In the inner event horizon area In one of these black holes Is a kind of safe haven Like the eye of a hurricane There, things are quieter You can imagine driving when you pass The crazy area is out Inside this scary eye of the storm ... the probe takes its course towards the heart of the black hole "Singular singularity" , Located in front of the end of the place and time The end of it all ... Our probe is approaching its destination Singular singularity in the heart The "super black hole" Rami - a Here, place and time Our understanding of the universe is over Inside the inner event horizon of the rotary black hole You can consider the uniqueness of the fellowship It's there, in a loop The real fish of the loop is zero It is a circle of points Its sporty thickness is endless And endless bending of the indestructible This was previously a huge star Locked to a tiny point And density of space and time Spinning at a terrible speed The centrifugal force That point is pushed to a loop Fold the space-time around It is clear that it is about individualism There is an area called "Semi-time closed curve" A fanciful way to say it You can go to that area You can fly around then you can go out And exit before you enter You can basically visit your past copy Before they enter the foundation OK Place and time curved around the individualism They make a general relative time machine The probe can theoretically return in time Before it exists But what happens if he travels through the individualistic uniqueness? There is a theory that the black hole He digs a hole in the fabric of place and time Another hole may be punctured , Somewhere far away If you fall in the black hole you will come out From the other side Which is light years away Although you did not take time To pass that distance We call it the wormhole Because it is like a worm that drowns its way through an apple But can we survive this trip? What comes into exclusivity My lover may come out for another place But what comes out will not have a big relationship Including income It will not only expand But will be devastating If you want to go somewhere else, take a plane There is another theory That individualism is not a vertical hole It is a white hole The hole is basically white Is a black hole that is back in time So the white hole It is the uniqueness of my time In the universe and keep things away from him Not attract them Singularity singles Kuna Much like the big bang Our great explosion came out Traditionally I have been unique People were not lost That is the end point of the hole Black is an individualism Is there a relationship between the two? Maybe ,but in fact This singularity is unique Extremely dense and tiny It may be a fantasy The infinities appear In physics it tells us There is no evidence of what we are saying We have not really seen anything Infinitely in physics So I guess there is no exclusivity And whatever we see Unlimited emanations from equations ... It is only telling nature to us We are wrong "General Relativity" of Einstein I would commit suicide if I were to be alone It can not continue spacetime After the singularity of the zodiac How do we solve this? I do not know We do not know what is happening to her This is the end Our unique probe trip I have reached the end of space and time And limits of human knowledge Sure enough now That the black holes are the attrition of physics It breaks every rule we know This shows us our shortcomings It's not the problem of the black hole We do not have the knowledge to interpret it This will be a continuing challenge, and we are encouraged In a real way towards the heart of a black hole On our journey towards the heart of the black hole We discovered it more than Scary science fiction monster It is a time machine and a cosmic museum Destroy the worlds and make them And the strongest mysteries of the universe If we understood black holes We will understand how the universe works Math is strange Difficult remarks Concepts go mind Who does not like it? I think many like black holes Just because it is big, scary and fun But we physicists also love it for another reason They are the most powerful physical systems Which usually give us the best evidence How nature works The black holes have been stripped of our imagination To the farthest Nature is more imaginative than us Every time we explore nature, we are surprised Because truth is much stranger than fiction The real universe goes far beyond the strongest perceptions For the best science fiction writer
