 Imagine a place Surrounded by glacial rock trillions ... a mysterious dwarf star A ball of magnetic bubbles Each offering 100 million miles Destroyed by a global war between deadly radiation fields That is not a distant area of ??a galaxy It is our creativity ... our solar system And what happens within it Separates our life or our death "The Ways of the Universe" {\ A10} over the past century

 {\ A10} Our understanding of the universe increased greatly We have discovered billions of stars in our galaxy And billions of new galaxies across the universe We saw black holes shooting cosmic rivals ... and Ngooma is a nuclear explosive And new planets in distant solar systems But when it comes to our cosmic title We hardly know much When we study space The closest thing to us is our solar system This is what we understand best But it is clear that we are at the beginning of the road We do not understand anything in our solar system The solar system is our home, our neighbor

 But you might be surprised to find out We do not really understand how wide it is When I was a boy, I learned Order of planets in the solar system It was the farthest planet Pluto The solar system stopped there This was completely wrong If you think the solar system ends With the end of the planets, where Neptune and Pluto You are missing the bigger picture ... We just started knowing the amazing fact More than ninety percent of our system The solar begins where planets end When the sunlight reaches this distance They are very weak But we knew there was something there Because he has been sending us visitors Comets It was assumed to come from a mysterious disk Behind the Neptune orbit But no one has The Quiber belt was theoretical He was believed to exist But he also thought it was difficult to observe We are talking about Agram It may reach 100 miles But it is billions of miles away Try to find something much smaller It will be extremely difficult No one thought of doing it In 1986, a team of astronomers "Stationed at the Muna Kia Observatory in Hawaii They decided to prove their mistake I usually store These observations were taken when we were watching I used to write a lot of things in a blog To try to track Everything that happens on top of the mountain Here is the name of the telescope , "80-inch telescope on" Mona Kia "Also known as" Rust Baket Visitors to this telescope They always think that it was the ugliest thing they saw It is brown Sounds like rusty Parts of it are rusty So it's a gruesome-looking telescope But we use it in all our work If they could locate a particle beyond the planets He must have a Kuiper Belt They did not find anything for six years It's like research "For a rusty coin in the state of Texas Games 00:04:13,117 --> 00:04:14,884 We spent many years We look for particles in the outer solar system Too tired Lots of disappointment We respect the size of the objects Yes we can see the stars at a distance Hundreds of thousands of light years But they are big glowing objects How can you see a particle that is only 100 miles wide Is it unclear? It does not produce any light visible from itself That's why finding these things is difficult The Kuiper belt particles consist mainly of ice So you might think it sparkles like icebergs We are in a volcanic country So most of these peaks are dark and covered with ash They are quite symmetrical "Belt particles" Kuiper So I wanted to get closer to this But my mentor told me it was huge We can not approach, may turn Well, we found a good one It is very dark Let's get up there Look how dark this is from the outside? Well, the comets are also black But in fact, I was tired of this We believe that comets are darkened by asphalt Black of tar Kuiper's dark-brown particles Remained hidden for half a decade Then on a summer night Joyce and his team monitored something The solar system will never be as it was So here you register Blogs we keep as we watch August 29, 1992 We started as usual Look at the pictures that come from the telescope We discovered this first particle It was one small point Moving very slowly across the sky His path showed that he was circling the sun But in an orbit that takes him far behind the planets The orbit puts him in the mysterious "Quiber" belt He was moving very slowly across the sky That was too far away We realized the slow speed It was far beyond a particle It was seen in the system So solar to that point Here 's that blog "A slow moving particle ... a question mark" This is if the Kuiper belt is discovered there It was those three letters In a moment, the Quiber belt became real And so Our solar system is twice the size ... It was a scientific leap because we now have this This whole part of the solar system Which we predicted without proof Evidence "Discovery of the first particle of the belt" Kuiper It was a clear indication of existence New numbers of bodies there Throughout the night We have doubled the solar system The team was later known "On several other bodies of the belt" Quiber They ended up calculating the billions of particles Which revolves around the sun in a vast disk It was the first guide Our solar system hides us great surprises Far from what we thought was the end of the solar system "Discovery of the first particle of the belt" Kuiper It was a remarkable achievement It was a guide to the existence of a whole group Of the bodies in the solar system , Which we thought existed Then we discovered the truth It was a great discovery as a discovery Full planet for example Discover the Kuiper Belt Instantly increased the size of our solar system But reduced the status of one member Because some objects in the belt They were bigger than our smallest planets Pluto was demoted to a dwarf planet I really enjoyed the conflict About Pluto Description Is it a planet? Is it a dwarf planet? Is it something between them? It shows how interested people are Pluto is still charming Is still an important part of our solar system But we see him as the nearest neighbor Let's not get angry That Pluto is no longer called a planet Take care of the fact that Pluto is a dwarf planet He can teach us a lot of Things about all his new friends Which we discover year after year Pluto now has more than 1,400 brothers and sisters They are called plutonoids If Pluto was a planet, so would all plutonoids I have a sister, it will be difficult for her Try to remember all those names Discover the Kuiper Belt Open the solar system But it was just the beginning of our expedition To the outer border The Kuiper belt distance from the sun is fifty times longer From the Earth's distance from the sun it's huge But if you think the boundaries of the Kuiper belt Is the limits of the solar system You think in a shallow way Behind the Quiber Belt far away The sun was reflected in a reflective shield About the solar system Our star is waging a global war Against the largest weapons in the galaxy Our lives depend on their success , For a long time We assumed that the solar system Ends with the end of the planets But the Kuiper belt was discovered in the 1990s He multiplied the effect of the sun The question raised scholars "Can they go further?" It turned out to be true, much further We would not live if we could not If you put a Geiger counter In this room he will move If you put a Geiger counter in space Move more It monitors a deadly kind of radiation Called cosmic rays Cosmic rays are essentially atomic particles Such as helium atoms, protons and electrons Which jumps through space at almost the speed of light They can travel far distances Hundreds and thousands of light years It is clear that they are hitting us here on the ground Cosmic rays explode from exploding stars Deep in the galaxy They are incompatible with life They can tear apart the electrons It can really change The chemical arrangement of cells causes mutations It can kill you If the earth was constantly hit by cosmic rays Without any protection They would not survive the advanced forms of life But cosmic rays rarely target us They rarely hit us in truth Clearly there is something to protect us Of the complete attack of cosmic rays from the universe It is our sun A reversible shield of 8.7 billion miles is made Towards space Using its solar wind When you think about the wind Think of the earth's air Which moves through your hair Solar wind is not It is really a torrent of high-energy particles It emanates from the sun, such as hydrogen It's real, it's billions of tons every second Some parts of solar wind move At about two million miles per hour Has a strong impact Blow beside us here on the ground Because the magnetic field of the earth reflects them Solar wind does not stop at Earth It's in space, it keeps moving It goes beyond the inner planets ... goes beyond the outer planets .... Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune And continue to move It goes beyond the Quiber belt Carrying the magnetic field of the sun 3.5 billion miles away You make a huge defensive shield About the solar system is called the solar envelope Solar wind blows a bubble About our solar system The sun is like a big mother Already made a bubble of charged particles And the associated magnetic fields that protect us Of the cosmic rays that come From outside the solar system The next cosmic rays Collide with solar wind Most of them turn into space Without this draw in the spaces of space to destroy us Like anything else in nature Solar wind is a double edged sword They can hurt us here on the ground But it also protects us Of those materials There are many models in the universe Where you think nothing It is at first dangerous and very destructive It can be protective And solar wind one of them Yes, there are those particles High energy coming from the sun But the impact of solar wind Protect our entire solar system Of more dangerous particles The protective bubble is making its way Through dust and gases Where the solar system revolves I'm talking about the center of the galaxy They make their way as the boat moves through the water A wave is slowing down Solar wind to be stopped Where it collides with materials Outside the solar system, into interstellar space And here NASA explorers found the boundaries "Interstellar") or "IPX" On a very strange and completely unexpected phenomenon The mission of "Ipex" already exists A huge emitter of hydrogen gas The biggest thing we saw In our solar system so far It may be the result of interaction The magnetic field of our solar system With a larger magnetic field for the galaxy Scientists believe that interaction Between the solar wind of the sun and the outside And the interstellar medium of the galaxy's inward drive The particles are trapped in a huge bar ... The length of the ribbon is about a hundred billion miles Making it the largest particle in our solar system It's interesting to know For these long structures at the edge of the solar system Because frankly, no one expected it No one organized it So by seeing something we never expected before That is how we learn And so the flag advances IPEX "and its technology in the 21st century" Tell us amazing new things about our solar system But its old technique has not It was drained from the 1970s Has been sending the most exciting news Of the outer border After traveling for about forty years Voyager continues to send messages to us Around the strange areas of huge magnetic bubbles And a high-energy giant competitor It explodes from our solar system In the past few decades We realized that our perception of the solar system He was missing ninety percent of the picture 25 years ago, we thought Pluto It was the limit of the planets at least in our solar system But we now know there is Many others like Pluto are there So the limits of the solar system have not only widened But we became more aware For our need for further learning Our newest eyes in the sky Staring in these areas The most remote of our being next door We are beginning to learn about the vast system of criminality In the outer part of our solar system Increasing our techniques We continue to discover more And more UFOs And our image of the reality of the solar system Changed as a result of our ability to improve our eyes But it is a very old technique that really takes us To those limits When NASA launched Voyager-A in 1977 They thought it might work for five years After 37 years, this small space probe Still sending us amazing information , In August 2012 It was 11 billion miles from Earth He left the solar field The edge of the solar system is completely mysterious The atmosphere of the sun Interstellar space This edge is the intersection of these two extremes It is a place where our neighborhood ends The neighborhood begins three hundred fifty 00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:28,568 "I was struck by news that" Voyager It was at the edge of the solar system This is a complete area of ??the solar system We hardly know anything about it For the first time in the history of mankind We have an automatic probe that lies in its center Measures what goes around It was amazing We can say for the first time, even a limited scope That human type is interstellar We are now out among the stars When our brave little probe looked between the stars On the solar system He had a surprise for us We thought that the solar field was in the form of a comet With a huge tail extending hundreds of billions of miles back But Voyager discovered something new and amazing No solar field found In the form of a giant tail He found a halo shape with two short sleeves This is a very important observation Because they teach us something new It teaches us the basic form Of the solar field I mean it's a long time We had the simplest picture But we have the details now We know that he has some compositions We can start with that Let us begin and begin with deep understanding For the area around the sun The tail is the wind Solar High Power The reason for these jets is pressure Or interaction between the magnetic field ... for the galaxy in the background and those particles Charged particles are fast The flow from the sun Voyager also sent us shocking news About the edge of the influence of the sun Perhaps the edge of the solar field is not quite clear It is not a dividing line Is not a definite end In fact, it is an extended area that is not clear It's hundreds of millions of miles away In the middle ... monitoring Voyager is something strange A ball of huge magnetic bubbles We thought the solar magnetic field Scattered at this point But this did not happen What they discovered was the magnetic field lines Of the sun has intertwined To make a magnetic composition foam thin bubbles This was a surprise, and an exciting surprise When the magnetic field of the sun is rippled It wilts and intertwined The lines intersect and connect again To be giant magnetic bubbles Each bubble is foamy  With a width of about 100 million miles, and that's phenomenal It is the distance from the earth to the sun Thousands of them surround the solar system No one was sure what to do Those are magnetic bubbles But it is possible This is a bubble Cosmic is the first line of defense In front of Hungarian radiations It helps protect the solar system Of the global aggression Think about how much technology is different Since the launch of Voyager until today No one had a phone in his pocket I mean no one was even able to Make a long distance phone call Across the ocean without being in great distress But with this old technique We are learning now On the edge of the solar system Imagine what we will learn in the next 50 years Voyager "after the edge of the solar field now" Travel through interstellar space But have you already left the solar system? Not really There is a lot of solar system out there "To pass it" Voyager And will have to travel for several centuries And thousands of years before that The real solar system is leaving It 's outside the atmosphere of the sun But did not pass the sun's gravity "When we go out, we travel in Quiber Belt Behind the orbit of Pluto, right? This is too far Beyond that, we have the edge of the solar field The area of ??the magnetic field of the sun So you might think you're at the end of the solar system But guess There are still things Are related to our solar system ,From time to time Something sends those things accelerating towards the sun The earth may turn its way In the far reaches of the solar system Far from the solar field We are blind We can not see in this dimension But sometimes messengers come from behind Deadly Messengers .. Comets There are essentially two comets There are short comets The other type of comets are long cycle "Comets come short-circuited from Quiber's belt This disc is the remnants of space beyond the planets She travels around the solar system In relatively small circles Returns at regular intervals every 200 years or less Long comets are more mysterious Comets may return a long cycle Almost every thousand years Or even every million years Unlike short-comets comets Which come in circles Long comets come in rotary orbits They can come From everywhere and from different directions This tells us that they come from a different place We think the comets are long cycle come from place ,Too far It is very much like a spherical cloud For things too far away Which rush towards the sun all the time When the culprit approaches, the sun warms it up The ice turns to gas, and the comet loses a mass Over time, those comets will disappear But it continues to come This confirms her stock there But where is there? Where do you come from? One of the explanations of these strange comets It's probably not our solar system The galaxy may be filled with snow Which sometimes flows on us Then we thought They probably come from another part of the solar system Perhaps our solar system is surrounded A reel of waste ... from the early days of its formation "Ort cloud" It has been assumed to have a stock A huge cloud surrounds the solar system in millions Billions, or even trillions of those snow bodies But we never saw it Ort cloud This is the default group Of comets, are those objects It's virtual Not observed at all The bodies in the Ort cloud are very far away Small and very dim So that we never noticed anything There is in the Ort cloud Something must fall To see things fall Of all those different angles From there, you can figure out what is there But the aggregation of huge numbers to build the Ort cloud Is a very difficult task You need a powerful computer "Luckily there is Kevin Walsh We are here in the heart of a modern supercomputer On those pregnant thousands of processors Working day and night to analyze computer models To understand the evolution of our solar system And what is there in the edge "Here's the supercomputer" Janus "In" Boulder - Colorado In supercomputers like this There are thousands of processors Tens of thousands of competing nuclei You can do more than One hundred trillion accounts per second In such a machine We need this If we want to try to understand the evolution Hundreds of millions of comets over billions of years Compare what I can do with a paper There is no comparison Using a super computer Astronomers can start assembling an image Of the large invisible cloud ... and start with what we can see Comets that rush toward the sun We will not see the Ort cloud unless a guilty person comes So we need to estimate times One comes right Which will make it pass close to the sun We can observe it , We can then reverse and say We see one in ten " "Years of about the same size Then we say, "For this, there must be billions "And billions of them make the cloud of Ort Accounts show that the Ort cloud It hosts up to a trillion of ice Stretching very far from the edge of the solar field Hard to calculate Extent of the Ort cloud But perhaps its edge Beyond the sun ten thousand Time from the Earth's distance to the sun Trillion miles .. one followed by twelve zero It is very huge ... very vast ... much wider , Of the solar planetary system So that if you remove all the planets from the sun Will not be affected until the Ort cloud How exactly Do the snowy clouds come here? A comic way of thinking about the Ort cloud They are the parts of the planets that are never used It's already wasteful The Ort cloud did not come as an original If true The Ort cloud formed when they tried But they failed to enroll in training To become giant planets In contrast, it was thrown in all directions It is now halfway to the next star It is a giant spherical spread 4.6 billion years ago, our sun lit up A cloud of dust and gas revolves around the newborn star Then gravity began to work Attracts gas, dust, ice and rocks To be the nascent planets The planets formed from structural units ... smaller parts of materials Rocks and ice Materials have come together over time Rampage of rotating materials Behind the remains on the body Rocky ruins in the asteroid belt Ice in the Quiber belt Then Neptune and Uranus participated in the event Lenathan rubble farther away But think about what happened ... when there are bodies falling together All kinds of small rocks under the influence of gravity Some will push around the planet The space is tossed away Most of them were thrown out of the solar system forever Which did not happen to it Continued in those circular orbits A million miles long This is the Ort cloud Billions of snow rocks It was tossed in all directions Until it formed a ball of snakes Around the entire solar system Orbit cloud comets Are the bones of the dinosaurs to form the solar system Contains ingredients Which met to form planets It is a time capsule than the solar system 4.5 billion years ago Most of the Ort cloud You will stay in this snowy cloud forever It revolves around the distant sun But some will fail Attracted by the sun's gravity Inwardly as furniture is attracted by glare A guilty person may sneak into you Without even knowing its existence These comets may be several miles wide It moves very fast Sometimes even a hundred miles per second This makes them very dangerous How serious is it? Ask Dinosaura Some people believe that a huge collision Who wiped dinosaurs Perhaps caused by a huge comet of Ort cloud It can be dangerous Like asteroids that we considered Responsible for the extinction of the earth Comets fall from a very distant place So it moves faster than asteroids This is why their collisions are larger Even if a small particle displays a mile or two It may cause a lot of destruction But many of the Ort cloud comets Which come to the inner solar system is very huge Imagine if he were one of them With a width of thirty or fifty miles, it will be a global disaster We have no warning Because we have no idea For the substance that is thrown from the cloud Ort us Our enemy may be remote The biggest secrets of the solar system A wicked twin of our sun ... a second star within our solar system "Nemesis" = "our enemy" We have updated our virtual knowledge Of the solar system To about 9 trillion miles after the planets But we are still working in the dark "Carl Sagan said." We are in the Magellanic era "We are not in the era of Columbus" What does this mean? I mean we know the basic parameters , For our solar system We know the planets We know of the Kuiper belt and the Ort cloud But we do not know the details We did not actually visit one of those places We do not know geography So we are currently filling the map We have developed , The presence of about two trillion in the Ort cloud A ball of waste , Of the composition of the solar system And occasionally One of these objects drips on us The important question is, why does one decide to come suddenly? What worries her? What drives them to fall And approach the inner solar system? There are so many different ideas For that reason Some found signs of a series of disasters Which virtually wiped out life on Earth The fossil record appeared in the presence Periodic series of mass extinctions Every 26 million years It seems to be something He was hit by a cloud of Ort Periodically dispersing comets Which opens up fierce prospects When we look at the stars Note that most of them are in pairs Sometimes they may be Very far apart It may take up to millions Years to turn around So the question seems normal The sun is a companion Did not we discover some for his distance? It is amazing to think that to the sun Brother or sister at the moment Because we know that more Of half the stars in our galaxy -100 billion stars- In binary, triple or quadruple systems So the only star is an exception Is this distant star responsible About Ort cloud cloud? What may have happened is that every 26 million years This partner star crosses the Ort cloud The orbits are down Comets are pushed in all directions Some come to the inner solar system It hits the ground and causes collective destruction The name of this dangerous double star "Sun partner is" Nemesis Nemesis has its problems The attraction of the mysterious star that you are sure By passing the Ort cloud Comets may be sent periodically Rushing towards the sun and the earth But if the sun had a companion star It should be easily visible "You think if that star" Nemesis It should be visible Stars are of course bright But the theory here is that Nemesis is a dwarf star Maybe he's a brown dwarf It will be very small That is why it is hardly bright The brown dwarf is not a star or a planet It's something between them A lean star never lighted The stars light up when gravity is crushed Pull the vast hydrogen gas together High pressures and temperatures are generated If there is not enough gas There will not be enough gravity to ignite a nuclear fire He did not become a star On the other hand, it is bigger than the buyer One on a thousandth of the mass of the sun These things are heating up But does not explode like the star does It is hard to see because it is too dark But may contain a large block There is a dwarf built somewhere in there Comets drive us in equal intervals? The brown dwarf run for these The degree will be blind to us to see But it will be hot enough We can find it using infrared With infrared telescopes Heat can capture something Even if it does not send a light Something like brown dwarf Even if it does not glow with visible light It must produce heat There are always flights that wipe the entire sky If there were a dwarf aged four billion years Somewhere near the sun you will be spotted "So far, Nemesis has not been found If there was no star "Nemesis" there Is there anything else that messes with the Ort cloud? Another theory assumes a relatively large planet The size of the earth, for example It runs far behind Neptune But monitoring a planet with this dimension Harder than monitoring a dwarf star The farther the planet was from the sun, the darker it was And more difficult to see So there may be a planet the size of the earth The sun is several billion miles away It will be invisible to our current encounters There is still an opportunity to have something the size of the earth , Away in the Ort cloud He moves the bodies "This was the last nail in the coffin of Nimes' theory We may never know what to say Ort cloud objects from orbit But it's not the only one there We still do not know where the solar system ends Search for the edge of the solar system Helps us with a bigger problem To understand the entire solar system How do you realize the whole solar system Without revealing his edge? Probably the biggest puzzle ever That our sun has many particles It roams the universe more than its fair share Probably because our sun is a thief She stole her sisters and brothers in the womb of the universe But those extra particles May be our ticket to get out When the sun turns the heat on us 25 years ago The solar system had nine planets in front of our eyes It is seven billion miles wide We now know that it is a thousand times bigger And display more than three light years The more we look at it, the more it expands It expands greatly Somehow we took our order Solar materials too much Theoretically, we can calculate the number of comets that have been formed When the solar system itself Then we can look To the number of comets coming from the Ort cloud We try to find out who is actually there It is clear that the two figures are quite far apart The number of comets formed with the sun Much less Of the number of comets that we find there There is a huge amount of material in the Ort cloud To belong to one medium size star The only way to balance Two digits if the sun Thief when she was formed Five billion years ago A great storm burst, sending a shock wave Across a huge cloud of dust and gas She pressed the cloud .. Producing zones of dense gas Star Nursery Hundreds of pockets of gases are compressed Under its appeal To be hundreds of sister stars We believe that the sun has formed With brothers and sisters in clusters We believe that the sun has formed in a cluster With 400 or 500 other stars If we could picture the composition of those stars They are very small compared to the distance between them But its cloud of comets is very large So comets can be stolen from them , The sun was smart She walked away when she was at the front I got a bunch of comets from other stars Then she went on her way Some of the objects that are now around us from afar She may have come from those other young stars Competing global brothers It may still be happening now We may steal the bodies of our brothers and sisters While deviating from the cloud of our Ort The nearest star is the Ort cloud Against the solar system The Centaur Man There may be another Ort cloud About the centaur man There may be objects interchangeable Between the two stars Midway between these two stars we found The true edge of our solar system And what happens at the edge It may be bad news for us It may be for the centaur man Effect on life here on earth Perhaps this star has particles around it In the Ort cloud its effect is attractive On our Ort cloud When something falls, it may be a result The effect of our nearest star This means it is not an edge Tightening and attracting not only infinite We humans like the edges of the separator like the border But the solar system is not It is fading It mixes in the galaxy as a whole , The sun does not live alone As well as our Ort cloud We interact constantly, in this way We are linked to a larger environment Milky Way This mystery may remind us Out of the solar system When the solar system ends There may be an end to the outside And the beginning of a new journey One of the fun things about knowing Install our solar system There are lots of other objects Which we can use as resources We go out into interstellar space There are rocks, there is ice Maybe we can refuel Our space vehicle when we pass Perhaps something as distant and fluffy as the Ort cloud Be our next trip Let's actually explore the galaxy We have a lot to learn about the solar system With many new surprises to explore Each time we open a new window on the universe We are surprised, and that's what excites me I wake up every morning and am surprised if I am not surprised And by opening up new technologies Our understanding of what is there also opens We build better platforms We send probes to space We have a lot to learn This is a really exciting part Our new eyes of the universe Show our solar system in a completely new window We are slowly gathering complex links Which connects it to our lives and to the color behind them Every discovery we do about the universe tells us There is no solar system like an island So that the materials come from outside and come inside And graduated from the inside out And when we gnaw at the outer edges of our solar system We change what we mean by the solar system We are taking the first steps outside the planet And start looking at our environment This is very structured The sun is like one voice In a large chorus of hundreds of billions of other stars And their own solar systems I find it emotionally true We are part of the larger population there To believe we found everything in our solar system And the assumption that we know everything This is not the way science works The science of pushing boundaries We continue to do so In ten years, if we did this program again I would not be surprised if we talked about new things
