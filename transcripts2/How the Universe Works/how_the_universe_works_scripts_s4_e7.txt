 Life depends on the earth On the seas, rivers and rain But is our blue planet unique? Or did the universe form Many other aquatic worlds like him? If we break the secrets The first Earth oceans will be decomposed Secrets of Space Life "The Ways of the Universe" "First oceans" Earth is the only planet we know With ocean of liquid water covering its surface It is the only planet we know of a life If you look at every living thing on Earth

 You see that every object has a part of water Be his devices But we are bags of water Which allows chemicals to move And do things we call life On the ground, liquid water Life is in hand But how lucky we are to have A water oasis we call home? We have a lot of water Is it here when the earth was formed? Or did something bring it here from space? Is owning such a water world a stroke of luck? Or is it inevitable? Scientists have long and well studied the origins The water of the earth, and what they discovered was amazing Our planet would never have been water

 The location where the land is located Currently it looks very Java If the earth formed like a rock Dry around star hot spicy How come water came here? Each possibility has its own problems, and we want to answer Tracing the right source of water for the earth Very complex The journey begins 4.6 billion years ago During the formation of our solar system Related to a huge cloud of gas and dust in space Inside that cloud, multiply Hydrogen and oxygen atoms Oxygen is one of the most abundant atoms in the universe More hydrogen atoms are available in the universe You will have a lot of what they do , Over millions of years These atoms combine high Interact together to be water Water molecule is fairly simple It consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom This newly formed water adheres to dust grains Inside the gas cloud Slowly growing into crystals of ice In the end, the dust cloud The snowiness becomes very dense So that they begin to compress under gravity This starts the process of configuring our solar system There is enough water here To fill the Earth's oceans more than three million times When we see the stars that are now composed We are studying hundreds and thousands of them See disks of materials starting to spin around Young stars .. Gas and dust There are certainly some water in those substances Gravity attracts more and more materials To the center of the cloud Crane pressure and heat In the end, big powers are urging integration ... and the first star .. our nascent sun It explodes alive Bad news about the surrounding water of the newborn star The star environment is time configured Extremely hot and violent Any water that existed in that area Because water is a pilot element, it will fade Water can not exist Near a star at the beginning of its composition Astronomers believe that the young sun may have swallowed Most of the dust and water that surrounds it And then detonated those relics Away towards space in Heavy columns of steam In the most active volcanic regions A similar process explodes the water Hot up in the air Deep in the ground, the water is heated heavily It does not have an outlet when it turns into vapor And goes out in those huge columns The primary stars have a lot of water around Games 00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:17,682 Magnetic fields around The initial star is basically made Water can be discharged It is pushed out via Those tunnels are in giant competition Which publishes water Out through the entire galaxy In space, the overheated water escapes through Bekaa weak magnetism For the poles of the first stars Water pockets within these vast steam vessels Finally harden into space Cold to be snowballs And escape from the first star Faster than the submachine gun projectiles eighty times Is this what happened to our solar system? The situation will be frightening To be there to see it But fortunately that Our galaxy continues to form stars So that we can study the primary stars across the galaxy And we look at things that are very similar What happened to the sun In 2011, astronomers watched the composition A star similar to the sun Their desks showed a central ball of gas Attracts materials inside Of the surrounding clouds Before you push the water out quickly About ten million rivers of the Amazon A similar process may have paid Most of the water in our solar system is newborn When the sun matured, the vines dried out ... and there was a new danger to the remaining water Hot torrent of particles Charged solar wind When the sun was heated The nearby snow turned to water And when the sun grew hotter She turned it into water vapor And when the sun sent forth its solar wind Luminous, I began to push this water away Solar wind blows in Ultrasonic flow of plasma Of the outer layers of the sun They collide with the surrounding cloud To pay most of the gas and water ice away There is only dust left With the remains of water related to it Far from the sun Solar wind has less impact They are also cooler The result is a limit of water ice It is half a billion miles from the sun Known as the snow line When astronomers discuss From the snow line, they were wondering How far is it Water from condensation away from the sun? Where the water is cold enough to condense To droplets and become particles and become snow? If it were closer to that, it would remain a gas The first and largest planet in the solar system It started at the snow line Where the snow is in More thick, his gatherings occurred Attracted to each other by gravity and growing A huge snowball grew She drew all the material around her To be manufactured in the end Jupiter the giant invader Where the snowball is in less Its thickness consists of a similar process Other Invasive Planets Saturn, Uranus and Neptune In the dry inner side of the Snow line, the dust gathers together ... to be a family of small rocky planets Including land Most astronomers believe that our planet is Of dry rocks not more With microscopic droplets of water adhering to them But even this valuable stock of water is threatened The most violent event in the history of our planet Our solar system is 4.6 billion years old What Earth is but one of the huge rock balls Which formed around the sun And the attractiveness of our young planet Continue to attract cuttings From the cloud surrounding dust Rocks that hit the ground Carry small amounts of water Remnants of time before the sun shines alive Planetary scientist "Dan Dorda" believes that this water He rarely has the opportunity to survive on the fledgling land Due to the effects of heat For many high-speed hits Building a planet is a very violent process Can be easily viewed here High-speed collision of a bullet This is one blow When the bullet pierces the target Some of its kinetic energy turns into heat You can see this sudden hot emission Using the thermal camera In the case of a real collision, a huge asteroid collision The energy is greater, the rock is already melted , And 4.5 billion years ago There were such clashes Per month To see what we have above The gun shows us the heat sprayer Transmitted by multiple asteroid collisions The cumulative effect of these collisions is heating up The surface of the earth is about the temperature of magma Heat near lava Common energy of collisions Boil the surface of the young earth There are great clashes This is a high-temperature activity If there is water, it is very difficult To be carried on by heat and energy Maybe the water ran away Sixty million years later The building of the planet slowed down And cool the surface of the earth enough to be crusted The remaining water is trapped inside it But not for a long time The primary solar system More crowded planets than now One of them - Thia - is rushing toward the ground Thea pulls out a large piece of the crust of our planet The rock fragments make a giant ring of nectar Which will eventually be bound to be the moon Earth swaying from collision Returns to a ball of lava The heat eliminates more water He collided with Thea Leaving the crust very dry Where does the water we see today come from? There are only two possible possibilities So the water stays on it either Enclosure in sufficient depth In the rocks do not even fading Or evaporate, or come to Earth after its formation Is our planet originally Of wet rocks than traditional theories allow? Or the ocean moved to Earth From somewhere else later? First of all, moving is a possible option Far behind the Neptune orbit A huge bar of material is located The snowy is called the Kapper Belt Consisting of the remnants of construction units Of giant gaseous planets Parts of those relics Snowy, known as comets Sometimes rushing towards the inner solar system Did those comets Invasive by bringing water to the first Earth? The comets are basically dirty dirty snowballs They are huge balls of ice with rocks and stones The gems and dust immersed by them We believe that fifty percent Of the comet consists of ice If you look at everything in the solar system Trying to find a source of water on the ground There is a clear answer Look at the comets Comet comets represent one The coolest scenes in the night sky When approaching the sun Solar wind blows up water From the surface of those dusty snowballs And it shall give rise to a bright trail that may extend For millions of miles Today, comets are rare visitors Of the inner solar system But four billion years ago, there were many The earth was in its own way It is quite reasonable that Expect these snowy objects Of the outer solar system Come inside and hit the ground The question is how much contributed The rocks present form the moon Shows the possession of young land for vast oceans Scientists calculate the number Collisions required to fill Massive numbers Comets come in different sizes If we take the average culprit It takes twenty or thirty million guilty To make the Earth's oceans If millions of comets brought water Of the young earth, it must have done so In a short period, the moon formed again Scientists look at the solar system for evidence For this rapid snow attack ... and found him in the lowest places a possibility Our moon seems waterless Earth is the only planet in the solar system ... covered by oceans , About 320 million cubic miles of them Covering 70 percent of the planet's surface Despite its abundance, the water of the earth is perplexing Experts because the crust of our planet was very dry If you look to Bekaa water distribution , In our solar system There is no ice here In the inner solar system How about our planet Earth, near the sun To end with that abundant water? Maybe the water came from behind the snow line Brought by snow comets But it took tens of millions of collisions To fill the Earth's oceans Walk on an ocean beach today and see For this vast water and thought of its coming In small pieces of ice here on the ground It's an amazing idea If comets brought the Earth's oceans What made many of them collide with our planet? The guide is hidden inside the moon nozzles Well, I have a picture here Pick up that little rock .. here , In the 1970s The Apollo pioneers collected rocks Of the largest moon nozzles to determine the time of their formation They brought her to our laboratories And we can date .. When these rocks formed? Planetary geologists have assumed that those nozzles The moon formation time was almost broken It was definitely a big surprise We found that many basins The huge collisions on the moon Did not consist in the early days of composition The moon, but hundreds of millions of years later During an era we call the late heavy shelling Because it happened hundreds of millions of years ago After the formation of the earth and the moon Heavy shelling began late When the giant gazelle lined up Their common attractiveness has With a huge belt of comets Near Mars And it sends forth a barrage of rocks toward the earth and the moon And other inner planets Neptune swings out He collides with the Capper belt comets Many of them are also shooting inwardly The door of hell opened Ninety-nine percent disappear From the Kapper belt and the asteroid belt Throw several objects everywhere We look at the moon and see it as a delegate It is covered with craters ... Earth did not escape magically Of this shelling ... for every crater you see on the moon ... because Earth is a larger target in space It consists of about 20 or 30 nozzles on the ground We do not necessarily see it everywhere now Because it is a planet active in geological processes She wiped those nozzles The land was hit by heavy shelling But how many collisions are there Come from water-rich comets? We do not know, and one of the most prominent scientific questions Have comets come to transport Ocean waters at this time? If comets formed our oceans It may have left behind a unique chemical imprint Because it is not all the water itself On the earth, for every ten thousand A drop of regular water There are three drops of semi-heavy water A rare molecule made up of deuterium instead of hydrogen Deuterium is a normal hydrogen nucleus But instead of being a proton in itself They are protons and neutrons linked together Nitron overload in deuterium adds weight So the water that is formed "Of those atoms is called" heavy Semi-heavy water is formed In an easier way in colder climates So the edges of the solar system created it More areas near the sun Ratio of deuterium to Hydrogen is a highly sensitive sensor For the place of water formation in our solar system Therefore, we can look at the abundance of heavy water To determine the origin and composition of that water In 1986, scientists gained their first chance To test the chemistry of comet water When the "Halley" comet made a fleeting visit To the night sky Astronomers search for the distinctive footprint The semi-heavy water, but not the result As they had expected They measured water weight for the first time and found it It is heavier than the Earth's oceans twice He passed through Hyokotake and Hale Bob In the 1990s These two newly discovered sinuses are the age of comets Which hit the ground During the heavy shelling But it turned out that Hyokotake and Hill Bob are owned Semi-heavy water is much more than the Earth's oceans People began to worry because total The water of the earth is also measured by the oceans Can not consist only of those comets In 2014, Rosetta Space probe He measured a guilty comrade ... The results have resolved the issue Semi-heavy water content three hundred fifty 00:22:24,766 --> 00:22:27,702 More than three times the water on the ground Generally, the chemical content of the Earth's oceans The atmosphere is different On the chemical content of comets When you look at a recipe Hydrogen in water molecules Which is the comet we have measured so far It is not exactly like water On our planet It is clear to me that the comets did not bring All ground water If not the snowballs Soiled is responsible, what is responsible? An unlikely candidate started to appear In 2011, the space probe Don He flew near the giant asteroid Vista We used to think that rock objects Like Vista it was very dry But the team's observation view is evidence of water on the roof Vista water turned out to be chemically equivalent Earth's oceans The water type is very similar to what we think it contributes Install water on the ground So there is a compelling evidence that those species Of the asteroids were putting water on the ground Scientists have shifted their focus from comets to asteroids But how did these rocks come? Which looks dry with enough water To fill the Earth's oceans? Interpretation may be found in the frequency of residues For an incomplete planet Today, our solar system houses Four rocky planets Mercury Flower Earth And Mars But there should have been five Billions of years ago, planets were formed Throughout our solar system But there was an area between Mars and Jupiter Where Jupiter's attractiveness worked on tearing Whatever he was trying to be Today, the scattered remains Of the incomplete rock planet It fills that attractive battlefield Its relics are a huge belt of rubble Around the sun is called an asteroid belt The rocks inside the asteroid belt range in size From grains of sand to giant rocks Offering hundreds of miles When I began to study work .. Falc, we called rock Dry rocks We now realize there is plenty of water Perhaps even liquid water on some of the larger asteroids Our new understanding of the water of asteroids , Comes from the study of meteorites Small drops of asteroid belt Which sometimes fall on the ground I have a sample of a meteorite called Kundright Carbon Its appearance and texture are fairly dry But I can tell you that the sample contains 20 percent of its water weight Even the collision does not release the hidden water Because the water is chemically linked to the elements Which make up the rock ... and see if we could get the heat on The Flame Heat allows water molecules to separate Chemical bonds and escape as water vapor Look at all that outflow This small sample of the meteorite emits All this water This is a direct and tangible guide to the amount of water Large quantity of water Which can be transferred Of the Earth from the collision of asteroids Four billion years ago There have been many asteroid collisions on Earth During the heavy shelling Each collision generates a severe emission of heat Which liberates the water trapped inside the asteroid Water vapor falls back to the earth in the form of rain The same water exists today in our oceans ... and our rivers Even in the cups of our coffee When we look at the footprint of deuterium In the waters of the earth, they match Meteorites and asteroids are more than comets So some water comes from comets But most of the water in your body now It may have come from the asteroid belt Until recently, water-bearing asteroids It solved the ambiguity of the first Earth's oceans But the discovery of a new geologist is assumed That these collisions tell only part of the story There is an amazing amount of water on the surface of the ground The Pacific contains a half-size area Earth's surface is almost millions and millions Cubic miles of water Yet it is not all water on earth Some of them are under the surface In recent years, he has done ... geologists with amazing discovery A layer of hot rock lay beneath the earth's crust Carry loads of water Seismologists have discovered Earthquake analysis When a huge earthquake hits Low-frequency sound waves are transmitted Across the different layers of the subsoil before striking The crust is on the other side of the planet Studies of these long-range clots appear Some sound waves slow down when they reach Hot layer of rock Beneath the crust is three hundred miles There is one thing known to delay passage Sound across rocks water It is not like an ocean of water They are water molecules linked to minerals And other molecules But if you took that water and gathered it together We think it will add more than all the water In all the oceans of the earth This huge stock of underground water A real puzzle Because it is impossible for comets or asteroids To penetrate the crust of the earth with this great depth It is really inside the earth There does not seem to be an easy way to move from the surface Even hundreds of miles towards the mantle layer ... so it seems that water is present The finder, came with the earth at the time of its formation Large amounts of water must have been mixed When the earth was born But this simple fact It means that everything we thought And what we knew about the birth of our planet He was wrong The heat of the sun evaporates water ... from the surface of the warmest ground A mile after a mile of burning sand dunes There is no water here Five billion years ago, the Great Cosmic Desert Which were stretching from the young sun up to the snow line Dry How can the soles of our wet planet be formed? From this dry rock dust? We believe that the material was made up In the solar system in the current earth position They were drier than the earth So we think the land has an additional contribution Of water-rich materials Where did all that extra cosmic water come from? He must have transferred something very much From the wet side of the snow line The guide comes from the observation of distant outer planets Inflamed from its original stars We often see Jupiter-sized planets fall Near its stars, and perhaps a very close distance Closer sometimes than after Mercury from the sun At first, these Giants near their stars They were a mystery How these planets were formed That is too far away About the snowy abundance of the snow line? The only solution .. These planets must be formed Away from her stars and then approached later We know that quality Of the planets do not consist there It's too huge It must have formed away and approached She moved towards her star This is exciting because it makes you wonder Whether our solar system Its always the same as today Or did our planets move forward and backward? Observations of outer planets propelled astronomers To assume a completely new theory of composition Our solar system Known as "Grand Tak = great change of destination" The theory assumes that the buyer has changed radically There was a time when the dust and gas disc Very thick around the young sun The newer the resistance on The planets revolve around them "In the model" Grand Tak Be buyer at the farthest wet side of the snow line But by slowing down the material around him The giant gaseous orbit is closer to the sun There is amazing evidence that the buyer may have approached Even the orbit of Mars When the buyer approached He brought with him plenty of water beyond the snow line This is an opportunity to push the elements from the outside In the solar system and push it For the area in which the land is formed Opportunity to add a range of water-rich materials To the land that otherwise would have become dry Like a giant snowman blowing up , Those substances and push them inside When the earth was made up So the buyer was scattered A collection of snow objects From the outside of the system To where the earth is composed While the Earth was still growing Screw the buyer to the inside stopped A hundred thousand years later when Saturn When an overlap of gravity occurred These two giant planets They changed the destination, away from the sun The water left behind by the buyer He merged himself with dust To form the earth and its neighbors of the rocky planets But how this water is trapped inside the earth That turns into the first ocean? Volcanoes may have played a crucial role Imagine the fledgling land As a bubble of volcanic activity You see these clouds The huge ash and dust are falling But there is water vapor Water vapor that may cool and condense In the atmosphere, he did Create a drag over a hundred Perhaps even thousands of years Until the moment when there is enough water The atmosphere begins to rain down There was an initial rain billions of years ago When the volcanic waters fell rain on the surface of the ground ... The first rivers and oceans arose Long before heavy shelling Which brought comets and asteroids to Earth Based on the evidence of the rocks It appears that the water is fluid and charged Of our planet Comets and asteroids Bring some water to the earth , "But if the theory of" Grand Tak The buyer will transfer most of the water Which we see fills our oceans today Earth was not the only planet Which was supplied with water from an invasion Buyer of the inner solar system Perhaps Mars and Venus On the oceans by also To appreciate the magnificence of our pulsating blue planet We find the reason for our water survival While our neighbors have been hit by drought Water distinguishes the sights and sounds of our planet When it's stealthy, it The sky is painted with a drawn-out pull When it is liquid, it sculpts and forms the land Water fills every cell of each organism , And when you see it from space The oceans of the blue earth are stunning Be prominent from its neighbors Of the dead and monotonous planets Look at our nearest neighbors We see the disaster that occurs when you lose water Water is not only important for biological life But the evolution of the planet is changing When you lose this particular molecule The entire interior planets originated from the same materials There is a strong evidence that Venus and Mars They also had oceans Mars had plenty of water in its past The entire surface is covered by those rivers The amazing tables are empty now But it looked as we see it on the ground With Venus, we believe we see evidence that it was He was also a water scientist when he was Young, though we have not yet explored Venus is as good as we explored Mars So our best proof shows that all of those The planets have begun to moisten and have passed through a waterway It is clear that something happened in billions Subsequent years he wiped the water Of those planets Why did the drought hit our neighbors? 4.5 billion years ago, Mercury grew up The closest planets of the solar system to the sun It is also the smallest Little Mercury was just about the size of our moon When it comes to carrying surface water The size is important If the planet were small, it would lose water In space for not possessing the attractiveness of his attachment Next in the order of the sun is Venus The flower was close to the size The earth keeps its water for a while , Four billion years ago The flower and the earth looked twins They had liquid water oceans They were covered with thick air But Venus, the closest to the sun From the ground, its temperature rose Its surroundings evaporated and the atmosphere was pumped Even filled with water vapor, strong gas locked Venus rose more heat Venus was in a vicious circle The water dried out of the rocks Even metals have been subjected to high heat So that the water vapor is released It was impossible to condense water It was very hot, there was no rain Water rose higher and higher To the atmosphere passing through Time when he fled away Now the flower is a burning earth Burning under a thick atmosphere Of all rocky planets Mars is far from the sun Its northern half was previously covered by an ocean ... deeply miles But it was not heat or lack of gravity What made Mars lose its liquid water Mars oceans exploded with radiation Mars has no magnetic field You need a magnetic field to protect yourself From the solar wind, those particles are subatomic Which explodes from the sun The Earth has a magnetic field that generates it Its dissolved iron rotor This area protects our envelope Air from the solar wind Mars is smaller than Earth So cool it off to close its magnetic field He exposed his atmosphere Of solar radiation The waters of Mars did not have the bounty of luck The next radiation separates hydrogen from oxygen Hydrogen is very light He fled into space and disappeared So Mars has plenty of oxygen For this we assume that Mars is a red planet Because it is rusty because Bumper oxygen that was previously water It is now in the rocks The oceans of Mars evaporated Leaving little snow Its topography is bright red Four rocky planets originated at the same time Of the same structural elements But one of them was lucky Water is necessary for life on Earth It is the perfect solvent for organic molecules To make the life machine function I would not live without water or you Water can geology It can be climate The Earth can be revived I think this makes it a great feature It took 14 billion years The abundant luck of the earth until it becomes wet Then it remained moist for a long time enough to develop As we understand our first oceans Our understanding is how much luck you have He has conquered many other worlds in the universe We have already discovered planets Liquid water can be present We do not know for sure, but we will know I think we will know at The next few decades We will be able to distinguish a planet where we can say "There is liquid water on the surface of this planet" This will happen when the universe changes and matured We realize that we have brothers and sisters In the Milky Way galaxy
