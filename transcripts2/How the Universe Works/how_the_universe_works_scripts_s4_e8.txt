 , 27 December 2004 , While America was asleep Shock wave of cosmic radiation I rushed through space at the speed of light He saw no one coming The radiation hit the ground To rip part of the upper atmosphere It was the most amazing event we have ever seen In modern astrophysics The gift of energy is huge Equivalent to annual output For a quarter million sun-sized stars But where did she come from? Biggest flashpoint? An outlet of a huge black hole?

 It turned out to be a small star official In the far side of Milky Way Magnetic field stronger than anything Scientists have seen it before From a distance of fifty thousand years Light, this small body Only a few miles before he had a fit She physically affected the earth To understand how this little star has become a deadly weapon We have to take magnetism Magnets look simple Either you snuggle or disobey Maybe they were playing with magnets And try to bring it closer And she approached and clung to one another Some attract But if you reverse it, it will turn away How can magnets attract and drive? The amazing answer .. Light It turns out that what is happening is there Particles exchange between this Magnet and that magnet These particles are called photons They are the same photons that make light Photons are groups of energy monitored by our eyes To see the world around us And in the world of quantum quantum mechanics Photons in the heart of magnetism Submerged down to the subatomic level We see atoms as nuclei Surrounded by a cloud of electrons Think about the composition of the atom There is a positive charge of the nucleus Electrons have a negative charge They attract each other To illustrate this attraction, quantum physicists They assume that protons and electrons are subtracted Short-term emissions from photons The two different particles of the charge absorb light from each other This attracts the particle to each other This gravitational force is known as electromagnetism The atoms were not sticking to each other Without the presence of electromagnetic forces Electromagnetic also works on Connect the atoms to each other To make the molecules that we make And all around us Electromagnetism is responsible ... about the installation of our material The atoms are interconnected Molecular links in our bodies are linked together Electromagnetic reactions So they are connected together with light The universe without electromagnetism Games 00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:00,765 Will be torn If the electromagnetic is stopped The article has been moved Everything will be torn I have my mighty strength To hold you, but you will perish Electromagnetism does not bind everything But it gives things its hardness When you meditate something This is also an electromagnetic force We have electrons in our atoms and repel some of them When we try to touch something, those forces It prevents you from actually trying to touch it The reason I do not fall across the ladder Not because the ladder is solid Most of the stairs are vacuum They are the electrical forces of the atoms in the stairs Off the electrical forces of the atoms in my body That hold me These simple powers of those few atoms are enough To pull me off the entire gravitational force Of the Earth Electromagnetism prevails Electromagnetism prevails on earth, and in the night sky In fact, powers Electromagnetism forms the night sky Return in time to the universe Only 380,000 years old At that time, the universe was only a raging mix Of subatomic particles Protons and electrons and between them Light energy In the newborn universe, there were no atoms Because the energy was too large So that it separated the charged particles Which is found in a thick soup and very hot Then everything changed In the time between the age of the universe is accurate When he was 300,000 years old Electromagnetism slowly came to the vanguard Protons and electrons began Affected by electrical forces The seeds were merged Electromagnetism began Basically by defining a dynamic Material, and composition of everything we see Electromagnetism attracted Electrons and protons together To form the first elements, hydrogen and helium And the light trapped between those elementary particles He was free For the first time ever, the lights of the universe It was started When the atoms The nascent spin around each other Its mass magnetic effect began to work The smallest magnets in the universe Are the atoms themselves that are essentially made Micro magnetic electrodes In the world scale under atomic In the end, these micro-magnets are messy Start to docking Generates large magnetic lines Also known as magnetic fields , Then over time Those magnetic fields began to increase So all fields The magnetism we see today In our universe we can attribute it to those Primary magnetic fields He conducted a revolutionary new research into these The original magnetic fields Change everything we thought How to configure stars The old picture of how stars originate You only need gravity and time But we realized that the problem More complicated than that These magnetic fields play a vital role It is possible without Those magnetic fields The stars themselves did not arise After the Big Bang a year Magnetism is about to Ignite these first stars of life Previously we thought that star formation was easy Take a huge cloud of gas And add some gravity Wait for gravity to crush the gas To a hot ball of plasma Heat and pressure rise until fusion occurs A star is born Scientists now believe that Gravity alone is not enough To build a star, you also need magnetism The main engine is when Star formation is gravity The material is concentrated in the middle to form a star And while this star is formed There is a substance around it The central mass is attracted to its attractiveness but there is a problem That substance has what we call angular momentum Angular momentum is the force of rotation Which keeps the turnover Pull the gas around the center The assembled star It works opposite gravity Which crushes the gas into a thin disc Angular momentum and gravity are essentially in a fight What angular momentum maintains Things are spinning out here While gravity tries to stifle them Towards the middle If we could somehow By weakening this angular momentum The composition of the star will be completed Young stars, or primary stars Do not ignite unless the central gas cloud has reached Into a very hot, overcrowded state But the disc rotates around the center very quickly Gravity is difficult to do Scientists now realize that a third force In the theater here Where magnetism can play a role First Star Magnetism, Constituent Star It can affect and slow down the disc , And allow him to fall to the center The star helps to form Rotary gas in the formed star And the disk surrounding it They generate strong magnetic fields These fields pick up particles that are fast moving It slowed down Magnetism acts as a cosmic brake Slow down a bit Finally, it turns towards the middle Gravity begins to win Gravity overrides angular momentum The composition of the star occurs Gravity pulls the inertial disc It will crush it until the gas condenses and ignites The star explodes with life This is our universe as it looked 12 billion years ago The invading universe is full of blooms Where gravity and magnetism are based By pulling out the hydrogen gas To configure stars Some of the biggest stars are burning Its hydrogen fuel is fast Without the power of integration There will be nothing to fight against gravity This may sometimes occur To a violent magnetic death When the star collapses and explodes into a greater velocity External gas layers The star is rushing toward space The core of the star is crushed inside To enhance its magnetism If you look at the stars For almost all stars Strong magnetic fields in its surface When the star dies, it collapses And the amount of magnetism must remain If the surface of the star has decreased A thousand times or ten thousand times It means that the magnetic field intensity Should be increased by the same amount When the core of the supernova collapses The strength of the magnetic field grows At the end of this command You get a 12 mile ball Called a magnetic star These dense balls have Magnetic fields are very strong In fact, the strongest magnetic fields in the universe The magnetic field may be a trillion times stronger Of the Earth's magnetic field If you come too close to a magnetic star He may be doing this Strong magnetic ripping Where your atoms can not stay together Close to this strong magnetic field Massive stars with potential Composition of magnetic stars Still exist through our universe Scientists know that there are 23 stars Magnetically in our galaxy today One of which is SGR1806-20 Fifty thousand light years away Is the same magnetic giant that launched the attack On the ground in 2004 The blast prompted an earthquake It is like a Earth quake but it is a star And the crust of the star slipped that much About centimeter Show your finger, but it was much larger Of any earthquake on the planet Million times more powerful The magnetic field is associated with the material inside it , When the crust slipped The magnetic field also slipped He unleashed a powerful emission of energy So that it is 50,000 light years away He physically affected our planet Luckily it happened in the middle of the galaxy If this thing happened nearby The effect would be huge The magnetic star on the After two light-years of earth Will destroy our planet There will be an emission Of radiation can actually Tearing our air cover Without an atmosphere, there is no air to breathe Animal life will die Without atmospheric pressure, the seas will boil The earth will fall like a lifeless rock Spin through space In the World Monster Show of Monsters and Ghouls And scary things at night I think the magnetic stars at the top of the list Very scary things During the violent birth of magnetic stars Great eruptions erupt Shock waves towards Milky Way In these shock waves Scientists look for signs Of some of the largest magnetic fields ...in the universe So huge that it swallows our entire galaxy For centuries we have been studying our galaxy ...Milky Way We draw gas and dust maps and 200 billion stars In the skies of Lille But it turned out that we were missing something Something great A giant network of magnetic fields Fill our galaxy from first to last It is the largest single installation in the Milky Way A single atom may have a magnetic field The magnets rod has a magnetic field I also have the earth, and I have the sun In fact, it has huge structures like galaxies The Hungarian magnetic field is huge It's basically the size of the entire Milky Way Magnetic field that can accommodate our rotary mill Its width is 150,000 light years Its thickness is 30,000 light years Astronomers who analyze Map of magnetic lines Which form the Hungarian field They discover something amazing Rotating motion of stars and pulling gas Which fills our galaxy does not explain All the magnetism we see There is something else out there Makes giant magnetic fields Where do these huge magnetic fields come from? Where the fields come from Magnetic sweeps of the galaxy? Scientists obtained their first evidence of origin Those mysterious magnetic fields Looking at the remains of dead stars long ago The chair is a "supernova" A huge ball of gas and dust is rushing towards space By an explosive star Its light first reached the Earth three hundred years ago Astronomers who follow Evolution of magnetic fields Through its expanding expanse of gas They discovered that the fields were on the main border of the remains Which was reinforced when it collided with a nearby pull Of interstellar gas Shock waves can be triggered by precipitation Great to make excess magnetism Which we see in the Milky Way today? A new generation of empirical cosmologists They insist on finding out Gina Monica "uses one of the" The most powerful laser in the world To simulate shock waves For the supernova in the laboratory What I can do Is the use of huge laser devices In fact, bigger Laser devices on the ground for manufacture Super Raiders Nine Comfort Your Hands Gina starts the experiment Place a small piece of carbon rod To laser range The six laser beams are all on the carbon rod In a room filled with gas, which happens That the article would expand in a catalytic manner To create a shock wave, hope That shock wave generates magnetic fields Well, the closure is done for launch Let everyone out This is the west target We closed and ready to launch Full energy in the six rays The laser working team is aiming On a small carbon target The laser is heating Target for more than a million degrees Carbon explodes to produce shock waves Beat the surrounding gas We succeeded We succeeded in correcting It seems that the laser hit our target accurately We have this shock wave Beautifully resurrected The laser came from this direction And struck our carbon rod These are all the relics that were moving three hundred fifty 00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,773 Very quickly, these Shock wave generated As a result In-room monitoring devices Confirm that the shock wave It has generated powerful magnetic fields When I hit the gas around This shock wave moves through space This is what makes all these magnetic fields Along the front Jenna believes that the process is similar They make large magnetic fields in space The shock waves of the great interceptors collide Pulling a giant gas between the stars Such as the tsunami The quick-moving introduction to gas rages Particles charged inside a gas cloud Collide with each other To create strong magnetic fields Which extends far into space So we have a mixture of charged particles Which spin and move quickly in chaotic ways When you have such activity You have magnetic fields The shock waves of the superconductor are responsible for Most of the excess magnetism in the Milky Way But not all of them Because it is not the only cosmic phenomenon With great power to hit The black holes are overflowing A competitor of very hot materials Towards space These vents penetrate the gas clouds To create the disorder that is born Other strong magnetic fields Sometimes the gas withdrawal collides with each other with extreme violence Creating huge magnetic storms Shock waves are steroid Which strengthens muscles Magnetism of Milky Way And distribution of that magnetic mass Perhaps the key to solving one of the greatest mysteries ... in cosmology Why do you miss the night sky? More than a trillion stars There are speeches in our galaxy There are not enough stars The Milky Way consists of More than two hundred billion stars Line up in a flat snail But there should be more there, a lot One of the hardest things to understand About Milky Way is Why there are few stars Should possess Milky Way Ten times its current stars But it does not One big question, why? According to the laws of traditional physics The Milky Way should have been larger It is surrounded by a giant pull of gas and dust Building units for new stars Over billions of years The great attraction of Milky Way These clouds should be absorbed within their boundaries But scientists believe the universe Today the magnetic fields Contrast with star formation There is a huge amount of gas Which come from outside the galaxy Which you want to fall down and then be available To configure stars What prevents all this gas and dust Which we know exist Is there a switch to stars? Magnetic fields may be the cause How did the magnetism If the Milky Way is disabled From inflation? Ten billion years ago, the fledgling Milky Way It was only a huge ball of stars But over time, he worked Flatten the ball to a disk The disc increased when she did Its great attractiveness More and more stars Gravity in the end Is primarily responsible for the compression of the material Which are galaxies When the material begins to move and interact Magnetic fields become important First shock waves The great intercessors make trouble Venture magnetic fields To the neonatal disk of the Milky Way When the disc rotates, the Those magnetic lines Weave a protective cloak around the young galaxy Here is the problem, our galaxy Network overlapping Of magnetic field lines And magnetism can Prevent materials from falling On the center of the galaxy This network has been corrupted Formation of stars in Milky Way Magnetic fields play a prominent role In the removal of this gas This disables star formation The composition of new stars was quickly corrupted As we thought it was Will be formed in the Milky Way Magnetic fields surrounding the Milky Way Prevent gas from falling For inside and the formation of new stars But powerful magnetic fields are also circulating Across the flat disk of the galaxy New theory assumes that Internal magnetic fields ... may play a big role in the evolution of galaxies Distribute stars Including our star, the sun The guide comes from a galaxy 2.7 million light-years away Scientists look at the triangle galaxy ... and they find something amazing Stars are bursting with life In line up all of them regularly Through the spiral arms of the galaxy Where vast magnetic fields are clustered What we begin to see now We discover gas clouds where the stars are made up Queued, and one way to occur this stacking By making magnetic fields Magnetic field lines act as a highway Of the charged particles She wants the charged particles to follow her path Charged particles in the gas clouds inside the galaxy Turn towards spiral arms By magnetic fields Here, the gas clouds condense Allows star formation to occur Gravity is responsible for the formation of galaxies But magnetism is what they form Magnetism may have reduced the number of stars Which we see today in ... Milky Way, and determine their positions Including the position of the nearest star of the earth, the sun The sun provides us with energy Which markets most of life on earth ... but without magnetism to tame it That energy was fortified Earth's defenses seem to be on the way to weakness Pulp dissolved earth rotor Generates a magnetic field that emerges from the poles Our entire planet is enveloped in a blanket of magnetism This field of invisible power Reflects deadly charged particles Which flow from the sun Protecting us and protecting our cover from catastrophic destruction Scientists now fear that we Perhaps we lose this vital shield In the last 200 years, it has weakened , About 10 percent If it continues at this rate Will disappear in two thousand years If it disappeared forever We will have a long-term problem What will happen to the Earth? If we lose our magnetic shields? To know that, we have to look at our planetary neighbor Mars may have appeared in the past as Earth With a thick atmosphere and water on its surface That disappeared, why? We know that Mars has no strong magnetic field That means he could not Protect itself from solar wind These particles flow from the sun It hits the Martian atmosphere and tears it Its atmosphere has been removed By solar wind For not having a protective cover Of the magnetic field If we look at Mars today, it's cold Lifeless arid Because it does not have an envelope Is it destined for our planet To lose its magnetic field And it becomes an arid place like Mars? Geophysicist Dan Lathrop and his team They built a replica of the core of the earth To accelerate the development of magnetic fields Lathrop wanted to know that Earth's magnetism was diminishing Part of a normal cycle Of the increases and decreases Or indicates the beginning of a final decline Conducting such an experiment will allow you to approach Of something like the core of the planet More than any other means The iron is too hot to handle So Lathrop fills his ten-foot ball ... the best thing after Twelve and a half tons of liquid sodium metal When we conduct the experiment The main thing that we are trying to try Is the understanding of how the rotary mass of liquid sodium This troubled turbulent flow of liquid metal ... to generate electric currents and magnetic fields And try to use it to understand How the planets do the same thing Lathrop runs the engine, spins the ball ... to simulate the rotation of our planet But 350,000 times faster Inside the roller ball, begins Sodium dissolved in spin Charged particles around the core accelerate well, that is good It starts to appear A magnetic field appears Of the poles of the ball It looks like a field that protects the earth Lathrop measures the declines In the strength of the magnetic field of the ball But those declines are disappearing and rising again Lathrop also saw magnetic poles For his experience moving Amazingly, scientists found that the poles of the earth They do likewise When we look at the Earth's magnetic field We can see that direction Which is indicated by compasses Moving north At a rate of tens of miles per year "I moved from Canada "It is now heading to the side of" Siberia Do you continue towards "Siberia" and beyond Or come back to Canada? It is difficult to predict what will happen To try to predict the future Scientists are looking for signs in Magnetic past of our planet , "Planetary Scientist" Jenny Radebo "in Hawaii Home to "Kelawia", the most active volcanoes in the world Making it the best natural laboratory To study the Earth's magnetic history Great about the flow of lava they confine Earth's magnetic field Then freeze it somewhere If we caught rocks Of these folic acid flows We can see direction Magnetic field in the past Lava contains iron elements When melted, iron elements are lined With the Earth's magnetic field When the lava cooled This trend is frozen in position Drilling through the past lava layers Scientists have shown a magnetic record It goes back millions of years It shows that the area of ??the earth is not only weak and moving From time to time, the whole field is reflected The North and South Pole interchange The field is aligned for a particular direction for a period Even if they were raised in this column From the lava rocks, we find that the field has turned For the opposite direction completely One hundred and eighty degrees from what it is now This has happened several times, dozens of times This tells us that the magnetic field of the earth Change direction, not on a regular basis , But from time to time In a break of tens of thousands of years Perhaps even two million years between them It is reflected from north to south To change trends throughout Earth's history How the reflection will affect Next on life on Earth? The answer is amazing .. a little The biologists deepened In the fossil record of the Earth They discovered that the reflections Magnetism is not catastrophic What we know is that it will not be long To remain unprotected for a long time So wipe out life We do not see collective oppression Reflection of the magnetic field So we realize that it is relatively fast Earth's magnetic shield He protected life from sun radiation Billions of years And will continue to do so But we are different from our ancestors We harness the power of electromagnetic Each device extends energy to our technique This puts us at risk Of a threat that could destroy humanity Humankind may go without knowing Towards a major disaster We have built our civilization On electromagnetic bases There is a threat in the sky May destroy it at any moment We rely on the sun from , For our lives and for our civilization But it could easily rob this We have wires everywhere We use it to transport currents But this infrastructure is vulnerable For activity on the sun We are protected all the time from the solar wind ... the magnetic field of our planet But the sun also has a magnetic field And sometimes become magnetic lines Weapons of mass destruction Magnetic fields Store a huge amount of energy The sun has surplus of it  If she remained, it is not a problem But what happens is that Magnetic lines may be attacked When the magnetic field is attacked It frees up all its stored capacity The surface of the sun rises, to explode Magneticly charged shells of particles Called "coronal mass emission Mass emission To detonate that energy There is a huge amount of subatomic particles About 1 billion tons Which explodes from the sun And progress towards interplanetary space I have this cloud of Particles are their magnetic field Who goes with her, even if he struck the earth They can interact with our magnetic field When mass emission collides The magnetic field of the Earth The collision may occur in a rush Of the current in the power lines Which transmit energy to our homes and businesses All our electromagnetism infrastructures All power lines, transistors, and everything All of this absorbs this current The load may increase on the circuit Causing electricity interruptions And a lot of inconvenience to society The earth hits about 150 emission Eucalyptus kidney each year Most of them are small, causing interruptions The current is at worst But the sun has the potential To unleash a devastating coronal mass emission At first, this shell Of charged particles Will hit the satellites Which revolves around the earth A huge solar storm May affect satellites And it is disrupted We may lose contact, may We lose GPS The Global Positioning System is used In all stock markets across the world , Without satellites The financial infrastructure of the world Will collapse The planes will land on the ground The sea lines will be closed Mobile connections will be interrupted We rely on all those Things in our monetary system In our financial system, and for our civilization After the destruction of satellites The mass emission energy The coronal will affect the earth Strong electric current Will run through the power lines To increase loads on networks Electricity all over the world The substations will explode in a barrage of sparks Imagine a stormy solar event An explosion we have not seen before Causing huge electrical outages Imagine the entire United States Cover in total darkness It will take years and billions of dollars To repair electrical infrastructure Building and launching new satellites A huge storm could destroy our civilization Magnetism threatens to destroy our society But our electromagnetic behavior does not give up easily It is the force that protects us Allowing life to flourish on our planet It builds our sun and even The galaxy we live in Without magnetism, there is nothing Magneticity affects processes Ranging from the formation of galaxies To star formation Even processes that provide us with energy Magnetism is central to our existence in the universe Of corn and above Magnetism forms every body in the universe It is the greatest force of mass destruction It is responsible for nature The same article It is responsible for holding the earth For their atmosphere and their water You have to remember every day of your life You are here because of magnetism
