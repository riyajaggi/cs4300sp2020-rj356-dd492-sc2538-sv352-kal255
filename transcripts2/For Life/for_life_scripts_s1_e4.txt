 I, Aaron Wallace, am under the permanent custody of the State of New York, serving a life sentence for something I didn't do. Becoming a lawyer, proving my innocence ‐‐ that's how I'm gonna get myself out of here. Even if he's guilty, I still want him out. For Jazz or for you? You know I want to be with you. You think he knows you still love Dad? I think he understands there are different kinds of love.

 He's not hard enough on her. He's not her father. If he's not willing to take on that responsibility, maybe he should get out of your bed. You think Aaron's gonna find some way out of this now that he's a lawyer? He's gonna suck you back in, and you're gonna take your eye off of everything else that matters. You got yourself a career as a nurse, a new man. You are so much better off without him. Your husband is poison, Mrs. Wallace. I just can't fathom why you would be helping him now. Some cop rings my doorbell and hands me this. Your entire police file.

 This is the story of how they got me. This is gonna get me home. This is how they got me. This is gonna get me back to you. I used to think I was blessed. I was married to a man I loved. My baby girl was happy and healthy. I felt safe. I felt secure. I thought there would be time for everything. Yeah! Whoo! Ooh, we gonna get in trouble. Oh, screw Nurse Ratched! Shh, shh, shh. I know I should be nicer since I'm dying. You know, heaven and all that. Wait. First of all, you are not dying, okay? Not today, maybe. Three more days of chemo, then go straight into remission. Right? Okay. Positive attitude! Okay, she's gone. Ready? Yeah. Whoo! Hey, Marie. Hey. I am holding in my hot, little hands a letter of recommendation for nursing school. Oh. You make me sound like Mother Teresa. So, have you narrowed down the list of schools? No, not yet. But I will. I will. You're too good not to do this. Thank you. And there's enough space for three different bars. I'mma set up the deejay booth right over here. And they got this new thing now called a floating stage. It's gonna be dope. Can we afford all this? I mean, it's twice as big as the other club. Yeah, which means more people paying covers, buying more drinks. ‐Yo, Marie! ‐Yo, Michael! I didn't know you was gonna make it down here today. Yo. It's gonna be hot, right? Yeah. We breaking out the champagne for this! Hey, Angelo. How's it going there, Marie? Good. What's up, Lo? Break 'em out, bruh. We can't drink until we sign. Got you. Right now. Aw, look at that. Yeah. It's amazing, right? Yeah. All coming together. It's all coming together. Crack into this stuff, bro. King of the club. ‐Yo, what you looking at? ‐Hey. Hmm? You alright? What's going on? Yeah, I'm ‐‐ It's just... It's all moving so fast. Well, we don't have to sign right now, if you want to talk about it some more. Boom. Artillery. You know this. Come on. No, no, no. You've worked so hard on this, and I'm so proud of you. You sure? Yeah. Yeah. ‐Alright! Let's get it going! ‐Mm‐hmm. Alright. My man. Hey. How you doing, brother? Hey, baby. Come on, Marie. Get in here, girl. ‐Cheers. ‐Salut. To you, man. My partner. No, man, to us. We gonna rule the world. Hey, Jazz. You having fun, sweetie? You weren't even there, man. We told you about it afterwards. It was 1986, and you had some played‐out flat‐top. She wanted nothing to do with you. That's what I remember. Michael, you ‐‐ Michael, you still take his side on everything. There's my lady. ‐Mm! ‐Mm! What a party. Mm‐hmm. You outdid yourself. Did you say hi to Tracy and Ed? He's been talking about wanting to invest in the club, so I just figured you'd ‐‐ I did, and I'm on it. Now slow down. Relax and enjoy the party. Our baby girl only turns 7 once. You're right. Hmm. Well, now, that's what I like to see. Maybe it'll lead to more grandbabies. Oh! Ohh! Woman, come on. Mom, give me some love and get off my back. That kid of yours fell asleep two minutes into "The Princess and the Frog." I found this on the dresser. Yeah, Vanessa sort of went crazy with that. So, you're doing it? You're applying? I don't know. I'm thinking about it. Well, I think you should. Jazz is older, and now is the time. Just don't, okay? Don't push. Look I'm not. I'm just Look, it's eight hours a day, six days a week. There's lectures, labs, clinical hours, and study groups. Who's gonna be there for Jazz? Well, I've been saying we should get a nanny. And I told you, after what happened to my mom, I don't want our daughter spending her childhood being passed between strangers. I want her raised with family. Look, club's open 10:00 to 4:00. No reason why I can't drop Jazz off at school in the morning, come home, crash, then pick her up in the afternoon and get her settled. Aaron. Building something for yourself is not abandoning her. We can manage this. But you've just got to be willing to make some concessions. I don't even know if I want to do this, okay? So stop trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry. I just ‐‐ I just want you to be happy. Baby, I am happy. Happier than I ever thought I could be. But this is my issue. Me. Not you. Yeah, okay. Right. You're right. I love you. And I love you. You and Jazz are my world. Another full house tonight! This man want something, he's gonna make it happen. And soon we're gonna have a second club. Alright. Enough. Come on. Let me just spend some time with my lady, man. Alright. He's the king. Ever since we was 5 years old, he's had my back. You the king, my friend. The king! So, am I your queen? Hey, Ryan. You're welcome. Oh! Hey! Hey, stranger! Hey, Marie, this is Maisha. Ooh, I love your hair. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Yours, too. ‐Police! Police! ‐Put your hands up! Get on the ground! ‐Police! ‐Police! ‐Hands up! Angelo Torres, you're under arrest. Michael Miller, you're under arrest. Hands behind your back! Aaron? ‐No, no. ‐Aaron?! Get back, ma'am! Aaron! You want to go with him? What's going on?! Marie, don't! Aaron! That's my husband! Marie! Why are you arresting him?! What did he do?! Aaron! That phone crackles. Just pinch the cord. You'll be awright. Thank you. You okay? I had the arraignment. They de‐‐ b‐‐ What? They denied bail. Five more minutes. So, you're not coming home? Not right now. There was this ADA there, a bitter son of a bitch, name of, um, uh, Maskins. He seemed like he was out for blood. So, w‐what are they charging you with? I didn't really understand it all. It ‐‐ They were talking about "kingpin" charges. They were really coming at me, Marie. Talking about undercover cops in the club, that they'd been surveilling the place for months. They arrested Angelo and Michael. Yeah, I know. Have you seen them yet? I got to tell you something. Remember a few months ago? I got a call in the middle of the night from Michael? Um, yeah, the ‐‐ the fight at the club. It wasn't no fight. A girl OD'd. What?! Michael dumped her at the hospital. Admitted he was dealing. He said it was nickel‐and‐dime, and, you know, I told him to cut it out, and he swore he would. And the girl survived. How could you not tell me this? You know Michael. He's always messing up. Do the cops know? I don't know. I don't know anything. I'm still trying to piece it all together myself. So, what are we gonna do? I don't know, Marie. I don't know. You have to understand how serious these charges are. And if this escalates the way I think it will, they could seize your house. What? When? Next couple of months. But the thing is, even if they don't, you took out the second mortgage to cover the construction on the new club. Marie? Just give me a second. We need to sell the house. - No, no. I‐I told you my parents are gonna help. Your parents are working overtime to help pay for your legal expenses. There's gotta be another solution. No. I‐I never wanted to take out that second mortgage. I told you it was too risky. We were investing in our future, Marie. Look at our future now! You want me to sign, I'll... Send the papers through, and I'll sign. Hey. We're not gonna let this tear us apart, okay? Look at me, Aaron. Look at me. It's you and me. You're gonna get out of here, and we're gonna get through this, okay? Okay. Make a wish, honey. I wish for my daddy to come back home. Okay! Whoo! Who wants cake? You okay? I haven't even prepared her. Has she been to see him yet? No. We don't want to bring her there, to see him like that. Yeah, it's hard. He says you've been to visit almost every week. You know he'd do the same for me. You guys are like brothers. I know it's keeping his spirits up. I like the house. Thank goodness for my father. You still applying to nursing school? Already did. No time to wait now. I'm sure you'll get in. And you'll be great at it. Thank you. I'm scared, Darius. I'm ‐‐ I'm really scared. Angelo and Michael are now witnesses for the prosecution. The hell does that mean? Angelo was dealing, too. And now they're both saying you were the mastermind. What?! They've flipped, Aaron. Michael's weak. Always was. And you know I never trusted Angelo. What you want me to say? You were right? Fine, you were right. You feel better? I'm sure Maskins threatened them or made a deal. Whatever it is, it's not good for us. And if Aaron were to plea, would ‐‐ We're not talking about a plea. We have to at least weigh all the options. They hinted that they'd offer 20 years. 20 years? They would reduce the charge to a sale in the third degree. You can get out from under a mandatory life term. How much with good behavior? Maybe 12... No way. If he stays out of trouble. You have to at least think about it. I'm innocent, Marie. Come on. Aaron, there is something you need to understand. I have won cases with people dead guilty, and I've lost cases with totally innocent people. I don't have to remind you how the system is stacked against you. And we have two principal parties that have flipped. There are undercover cops who are waiting to testify against you. No, but that's not true. All we have left is you saying that you had no idea of what was going on in your own club. There's no e‐mails, no texts, no paper to prove that I'm tied to any of this. It's all hearsay. With or without a paper trail, the circumstantial evidence more than covers the burden of proof. It's my life. I'm not taking the plea. So, let me ask you something, Angelo. Which aspects of the narcotics distribution enterprise was Mr. Wallace responsible for? Wallace ran the show. He supervised and oversaw every aspect of the distribution process. And did, uh, Mr. Wallace eventually use some of the profits from his, uh, drug operation to invest with you? Yeah. We used the drug money to open the new club. Thank you. Do you recognize the individual who granted you access to the back room that night? Yeah. He's ‐‐ He's right over there. And when you went into that back room, what did you do? Bought drugs ‐‐ cocaine. How much did Michael Miller charge you? 200 bucks for two bags. The people call Michael Miller to the stand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth? I do. I know my son. He had no part in this. I'm not so sure. Dad, please. Darius! ‐No! ‐Darius! ‐Listen! ‐Hey! You would have done the same, man! It's over. It's over. It's over. Ma'am. It's over. Get him out of here. Okay. Now. Now! Aaron wants to testify. I know. His lawyer thinks it's a terrible idea. I tried to talk to him. You can't blame him for wanting to defend himself, after everything we've heard. It's like the man they're talking about isn't my husband. Yeah, I know. I remember you asking him about installing security cameras, surveillance? I walked him through it, then he said it was too expensive. But if he was really worried about Michael, why wouldn't he just do it? I don't know. I think maybe he just... got caught up in it all. Good morning, Mr. Wallace. Good morning. Now, you just testified that you've never sold or possessed a narcotic drug. That's right. And you also told this jury that you've never ordered, aided, or supervised anyone else in the possession or sale of drugs. Like I said, I'm innocent of these charges. So, when your friend Michael Miller testified, everything he said was a lie? That's right. And your club promoter, he was also lying? Yeah. And all the people we arrested outside the club ‐‐ all of whom say they bought drugs in the Trinity Room, they're lying? I don't know. How about the six decorated police officers who testified to recovering four kilos of cocaine from a ceiling compartment inside a club that you owned? They were lying? I don't know how that got there or where it came from, so... So, everybody's lying? No. Everybody's talking about something I had nothing to do with. If Michael and Angelo were selling drugs, I knew nothing about it. But it was your club. It was my club, but not my drugs. Whatever they were doing, they were doing without my knowledge. But you trusted them. I shouldn't have, but yeah. And you trusted Angelo Torres so much that you decided to open a new club together. Well, he was my partner. Actually, he was your employee at the Trinity Room. He was the club promoter, so technically, yeah. So, how much were you paying him on a nightly basis? Anywhere from $600 to $1,000 a night. So, tell me, how does a man earning roughly $800 a night come up with $400,000 in cash? He said he had other investments. And you vetted "these other investments" with your accountant and your lawyer to make sure that they were legitimate? No. And it never occurred to you that your club promoter, who had been introduced to you by your old friend, the drug dealer ‐‐ I didn't know he was a drug dealer. That's interesting. Yes. Were you aware that seven months prior to your arrest, a young woman overdosed inside your club? Yes. Good! Because I want you to take a look at something. That's the parking garage outside St. Jude's Hospital. And that's you and Michael Miller, correct? Yeah. Fair to say you're the one doing the screaming? Yes. Mr. Miller says that you were yelling at him that night because you were angry with him for exposing you and the club. No, I was angry because ‐‐ Because you knew he was the one providing the girl with the drugs. He admitted he sold her some cocaine, but only a tiny amount. But you just testified that you had no idea drugs were being sold inside your club, and now you admit that one of your oldest friends, a man you hired to help you run your club, was dealing drugs? He said it was only nickel‐and‐dime. Were you aware the young woman was underage? That's why I was so furious. And he could be putting your livelihood in jeopardy? Yes! Putting you in danger? Yes! Putting your family's security at risk? Mr. Wallace. Yes. But you didn't fire him? No. Did you call the police and his parole officer to report his criminal behavior? He was my friend since I was 6 years old, man. Okay. Did you at least install a security system to ensure that nothing like this could ever happen again? No. Even though he was a convicted felon who had had problems with drug‐related offenses in the past? He told me it was nickel‐and‐dime and that he would stop. I was just trying to help him get back on his feet again. By hiring him to help you turn your nightclub into a drug den? I told you. I didn't know. Right. Because ignorance is your specialty. And as to the first count of the indictment, charging a violation of Penal Law Section 220.21... Guilty. Criminal Possession of a Controlled Substance... Guilty. In the first degree, how do you find the defendant? Guilty. Sale of a Controlled Substance in the first degree... Guilty. Sit down here. You okay? Hi, Daddy. Hey. You got to talk through the phone. Look at you. You look 10 feet tall. Where's my Jazz gone? I miss you, Daddy. I miss you, too, sweetheart. How's school? I got an A‐plus in math. You got an A‐plus in math? You're the smart one in the family. I made a new friend. Hmm? What's her name? If he didn't do anything wrong, then why is he in jail? Your father's innocent, and this is all a big misunderstanding. When will they let him out? We just have to be patient. That's what you've been saying for so long. You said he was coming home, and now he's not. I know. I was wrong. I'm so, so sorry. Jazz. Jazz, hey, listen to me. Listen to me. Your father's gonna fight this. He's gonna get an appeal, and he's gonna win. And then he's coming home to us. But in the meantime, it's you and me, and I'm gonna take care of us. So you don't have to worry. Mama's got us. Okay? Come here. For inmate number 10‐B‐316. Jazz, what do you think? Hey! You did it! Sorry, no visitors today. We are on a lockdown. What? Why?! You know I can't answer that. Okay, who wants cake? Me! I need to say something. To our nurse. You persevered, made your dream a reality, against all the odds. To Marie! Open it, Mom. Mm! Oh, my God. Hey, take a look. It has your initials on it. Oh, I love it. Thank you for ‐‐ for this and for all your support. ‐Hmm. ‐Thank you. Well, you seem happy. Well, today was a good day. So, um, Jasmine was saying something about Aaron trying to become a lawyer? Yeah. Convicted felon? In prison? He thinks he has a way to do it. And you're allowing that to give you hope? That's all I have. You know, I was always afraid he was gonna hold you back, that you'd push down your own dreams because his took up all the energy in the room. But I saw he was a good father. I thought he turned out to be a decent husband. Took care of you, was devoted to you. He was. Still is. But he's also reckless, Marie. Believes too much in himself. Line of work he was in, having those people around him. He took chances he never should have. With your life. With Jasmine's life. And I can't ever forgive him for that. Even if he's innocent. But it don't matter what I think about him, because one way or another, whether you still in love with him or not, time's gonna come when you have to face reality and move on. I love you. Mm. I love you, too. And I figured out how I'm gonna do it, Marie. I'm gonna pick cases from the Bronx, and I'm gonna show that he's corrupt. I don't understand. What? See, I'm prison rep. There's guys in here who have been wronged by him. I got all their cases at my disposal. I thought you were looking for another appeal or a re‐trial. I am, and this is how I'm gonna do it. Show that he's a scumbag and bring him down. Bring him down? By this time next year, I could be taking the bar. And I'm gonna be on it. But you're talking years, right, to prove that? I mean, I don't know what you're gonna prove, exactly, but... Well, that he does this. He sets people up. I'm telling you this is the way, baby. But I gotta know that you're with me. You're who I'm doing this for. You and Jazz. Yeah. Of course. Alright. Well, that's the plan. I'm telling you this is gonna work. I'm gonna be out of here before you know it. Hmm? Mm‐hmm. All the way? Clean it all up. Okay, you're looking good, Miss Kim. I'll be back in a few. Hey, Erick. Hey. I've watched you with the patients. You're very good with them. I love what I do. So, um, would you be up for a cocktail sometime? I'm... sorry, I ‐‐ but I, um... Oh, you're married? I'm ‐‐ I'm sorry. I‐I didn't see. Y‐Yeah, I‐I don't wear my ring to work. Yeah, it's the gloves. That's right. Um... Jazz, dinner's ready. Hello? It's me. It's almost 10:00. How are you calling me? I got a burner. Now I'm gonna be able to talk to you and Jazz every night before bed. Well, I‐I don't understand. If they toss your cell and find that, this whole lawyer thing is over, right? No, that won't happen. I'm being careful. This phone will be my lifeline to you and Roswell for getting my case together. I'm getting real close to taking the bar. As soon as I've done that, I can get the rest of my strategy going. Yeah. That's great. Hey, is something wrong? No, no. I'm just tired. I should probably go to bed. I love you. Marie? Yeah. I love you, too. Alright, good night. Aaron got a burner. I know. He called me. Do you have any idea what he had to do to get his hands on one? I'm sure it was payment for repping somebody. Hmm. His whole plan ‐‐ I just ‐‐ I just don't know what he's doing. It feels like he's taking the same risks that put him in prison in the first place. He's doing what he can to survive. And we can't have any idea what that's like for him. I just wish I didn't feel so helpless all the time. Doesn't feel like there's anything I can really do for him. Well, what about you? You okay? Business is good? Yeah, yeah. Business is, uh, great. Real busy. Mm‐hmm. Whatever happened to Sharon? I liked her. Yeah, she was great. Just, you know, wasn't the right fit. Mm. You tell him about any of this? He asks, and I try to, but it's hard. Me talking about my petty problems. Him locked up in there like... Hard to believe he's been in there seven years. Feels like 70. And then it feels like yesterday. Depending on the day. Sometimes I know exactly who he is, and other times, he's like a stranger. And if he could see what my life is like now... What's going on, Marie? Hey. You look beautiful. You look tired. Yeah, I've been up all night reading precedents. Hey, how's Jazz? I know she was nervous about her biology test. Yeah. Well, you know her. She gets herself all worked up and then aces it. Well, I hope she's not being distracted by that boy. She's 15, Aaron. Everything's distracting. Yeah, I guess. Mm. Listen, I know it's been a long road for you, Marie, and I've put a lot on you. Aaron, I want a divorce. Is that what those papers are? Why now? I've been thinking about this for a while. Why now?! Every time I've walked out of here for as long as I can remember, I've been trying to figure out, what am I doing? What am I doing?! You found yourself. All those years, you wanted to be a nurse. Somehow I was holding you back. No. No. The hardest thing about all of this is not being able to share anything with you. I know you're proud of me, but you're behind a window. So, um... You giving up on me? I can't do this anymore. Look at me, Marie. Look at me. We created a beautiful baby girl. Come on. We did that. And we'll always be a family. But I just can't. I... Baby, we can work this out, I promise. I'm gonna leave the papers with the guards. I'm sorry. No, Marie. Marie. Come on, please. We can talk about it! Marie! Come on, baby. Please. Marie. Marie! ‐Yeah! ‐Yeah! ‐Come on, girl! ‐Happy birthday, Mom. Aw, thank you. Um, happy birthday, Mrs. Wallace. Oh, you didn't have to do that, Ronnie. And I told you, call me Marie. Alright, who wants cake? ‐Mm. ‐Dirty thirties are almost over. Oh, God, don't remind me. If you wanna jump out of a plane, do it now. No. Um, I think Marie is gonna be just fine. Here, I got this. Hmm. Oh! Let people take care of you for a change. Or, uh, go and sit in between those two. No date tonight? Never seen that before. I'm tired of dating. And that Internet thing, like, what? Y'all could have warned me about that. Mm. Oh, it's like the Matrix. You have to see it to believe it. But nobody looks like their pictures. That's what my last date said. So, what did you use, your high‐school picture? What? I don't look that different. Okay, kids, I'm gonna go. Bye. Good to see you. You, too. Thanks for coming. It's nice to see you having fun. Thank you. Get home safe. Mm‐hmm. Still can't believe Jazz is old enough to date. Man, our little girl is not a little girl anymore. Mnh‐mnh. Hmm. You haven't missed one single birthday. All these years. You've always been here. I love you guys. We love you, too. I b‐‐ I better leave. Wait. Darius. Don't do this. I don't want you to leave. I used to think I was blessed. And then for the longest time, I was sure I was cursed. And now, from one moment to the next, I realize I don't know what I think.
