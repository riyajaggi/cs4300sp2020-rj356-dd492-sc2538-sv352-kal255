 Then buy some nail clippers. But I've got some. No, I mean expensive clippers of your very own. But those are really nice. I'd rather use a nice-- What's wrong? You're staring off into space. You haven't eaten anything. I thought you were making your own lunch. Are you already sick of it? I overslept today. Oh, sorry. What were you talking about? I was telling you about this.

 It says, "This Christmas is the best time in your life for having a romance. There is an excellent chance that whoever you spend Christmas Eve with will be your partner for life." Oh... I'm really happy for you, Marina. It's not me. It's you, Nao. Really? Haven't you made any progress with Uehara? Christmas Eve's in two weeks. These horoscopes are never right. Don't tell me again this year, "I'm going to have a family party at Daichi's house!" A family party? You mean your families get together? Yes, exactly!

 Without fail, ever since she was seven years old their families gather around a Christmas cake, wear Santa hats, sing "Jingle Bells", -and exchange presents. -Unbelievable! Isn't it? Since your parents aren't here this year, you can finally get away from Daichi! Then you can make Uehara yours! I told you before, I'm not interested in Uehara. -Speak of the devil. -Uehara? Nao. Daichi. Oh, that one. -What's up? -Here. It's the TV drama you said you missed. Oh, you remembered. Argh! This is so frustrating. Well, until she accepts her own feelings for Uehara, it's never going to go anywhere. Uehara! What a stud! Over here, Uehara! Look this way! He's so handsome. Good morning. I guess he was up all night at his part-time job again. Nao. Yes? What... is it? Your nose hair's sticking out. Huh? Eek! Ow. My back hurts. I was just going to wash my face. -It's past noon, you know. -So what? Today's a holiday. What a slacker. Uehara, aren't you going out today? I just got back from working at the gas station, and the cafe's closed today. Huh? That means... today, Uehara and I are... alone together? Oh! So what? It's no big deal. What are you doing? What do you think? I'm taking a shower. But I'm in here now. -Then shut your eyes for a second. -What? Wait! Stop! Stop that! I'm coming. -Oh, Yuri-- -Excuse me. Sorry to barge in. Yuri, what's with all the bags? Sorry, but let me leave these here for a bit. There's a sale going on near here, so I couldn't help buying all this. Ta-da! What do you think? I bought this for all the year-end parties. It's so pretty, Yuri. Thank you, Nao. You're so sweet. Oh, yeah. I want to give you some of my clothes. What? Really? You spend way too much on clothes. So what if I do. I earned it myself. I can use it as I please. Don't talk to me like that. I'm letting you leave your bags here. I bought you something too. Do you think I'm a child that can be pleased with-- THE ORIGINAL TAIYAKI MEDETAIYA Oh my god! That's one of the top three taiyaki shops, Medetaiya. Waiting in line for this wasn't easy. Whoa! Before you get this, say you're sorry. -I'm sorry. -I can't hear you. -I'm sorry! -Still can't hear you. I said I'm sorry! Say, "Thank you, Yuri." Thank you. -Say, "I really appreciate--" -Quit it. They're getting cold. OK, fine. Oh, Nao, do you want one? No. I'm going to go buy something to drink. Watch out! Oh! Are you all right? -I'm sorry. -It hurts. Oh... No! EVENING STAR RAMEN $12,000! That's right. A loyal customer specially asked a famous potter to make these bowls. Three bowls cost $12,000. How are you going to pay for these? You're kidding! There's no point in trying to get it from a high school kid. I'll talk to your parents and get it from them. What's your parent's number? -No, you can't. -What? Because of certain circumstances, I'm not living with my parents now. Oh! If they found out about this, they'd take me to the countryside. I couldn't care less. Quit expecting special treatment just because you're a high school kid. Your problems have got nothing to do with me. Part-time help wanted, $9 an hour Could I pay it off if I worked here? What? Part-time help wanted, $9 an hour Let me work here, please! Are you nuts? I'll work for the $12,000! Dear Uehara, I just remembered something I had to do, so I won't be coming home until late. Send. I know I promised to do this, but I'm not sure I can. And these clothes... are hideous. Totally hideous. He said he didn't care if these got dirty but these are junior high PE clothes. The gap between Yuri and me is getting even bigger. Eek! What the hell are you doing, you idiot? How many more plates are you going to break? I'm sorry. WELCOME! WE'RE OPEN I'm in so much pain. I never thought it would be so hard. I'm home. You sure are late. Yeah, sorry. Huh? Where's Yuri? She left a long time ago. Oh! No! If you want some ramen, one serving is 89 cents. No, thank you. Where did this tree come from? Oh, Yuri gave it to us. It's a housewarming present. Wow. I told her we didn't need it because it'll get in the way. "There is an excellent chance that whoever you spend Christmas Eve with will be your partner for life." Uehara, you're working on the 24th, right? Yeah. I work all night. -I thought so. -Huh? Why do you ask? No reason. I just thought working on Christmas Eve must be kind of lonely. That's so stupid. It's only lonely people that worry about that kind of thing. Who said I was worried about it? Then why did you ask? Oh... Just forget about it. What a weirdo. Damn him! Ow! That hurts! So you're working part-time at a ramen shop to pay it off? If you spend all your time working you'll make even less progress with Uehara. Christmas Eve is... only ten days away. How many times do I have to tell you? I've got no feeling for Uehara. -There you go again. -I'm serious. I mean, he complains about everything and eats so much that it's frightening. When we're together, he totally looks down on me. And he makes me feel so miserable. In fact, now that I'm working, we won't have to see each other. It's probably for the better. Huh? "Will you spend Christmas with me?" -Really? Who's it from? -Marina! "I'll be waiting for you on the roof after school." "Abe Jun." Abe Jun. Isn't he in class B? -Oh, it's just Abe. -Huh? He's finally gotten around to Nao. Do you know him? Yeah. Oh! I've got a great idea. -Get over here, Mitsuishi. Come on. -Nao... No. You stay over there. This is to help out Nao. We'll tell Uehara... Nao. Uhm... I like you. I've always been attracted to you. Please spend Christmas Eve with me. Uhm, when I see you, Nao, -I feel like I want to protect you. -I feel like I want to protect you. Huh? My friend just told me about you. You always tell the girls the same thing. -The king of the love confession? -That's right. Abe's famous among some of the girls. He's always falling in love. Every girl he falls for, he texts, then they all turn him down. Is he really that unpopular? Well... He's not that bad looking. But he's not the type you'd want as a boyfriend. Nao would never go with a guy like that. -But we can use him. -We can? Oh! Uehara! Wait! Wait! Uehara! Can we talk for a minute? Please. I know you may not believe me, but I do like you, Nao. No. I'm sorry. You mean it's true that you and Uehara are dating? What? Uh... Well, yes. This world just isn't fair. He's handsome, smart and good at sports. He attracts girls without even trying. He hasn't got a worry in the world. Uehara has a lot of worries. Really? He does? Uh-huh. He's got a couple of jobs so he can earn living expenses. But he doesn't even think that he's got it harder than anyone else. He may look selfish, but he's always thinking of others. Oh, I see. But I'm still jealous of Uehara. Really? There's nobody I know who would say things like that about me. Yes, there is. I'm certain there is. One day you'll meet someone who can't live without you. But I'm not that person. I'm sorry. Look. That's the first time in her life that anyone's told her they like her. But she has no choice but to turn him down. Why? Here at school, everyone thinks you and she are dating. If she told him OK, the rumor would spread that she was two-timing you. Imagine the punishment she'd get from your fans. And although she tries to spend Christmas Eve with other friends, they wouldn't let her join since she has a boyfriend. She's only doing it because she's away from her family and she's lonely. Isn't that right, Mitsuishi? Yeah. In fact, Marina and I've got plans for Christmas Eve already. So we can't spend it with her. You know, I'm glad I talked to you, Nao. I'm going to work hard at developing a real relationship. -Good. -Bye. What a pity. She had to destroy a chance that she'll never have again. So, it would be kind of nice, you know, if you showed just a little kindness to Nao. Of course Christmas Eve is special for girls. -It is? -You see, girls just love dressing up, feeling a thrill, and experiencing love over and over again. Christmas Eve is all that wrapped into one. Spending it all alone is like God telling you that you're a failure as a woman. It's hard to believe you're still in junior high. So right now all the girls are in a mad dash to avoid spending it alone. A mad dash? What I mean is they're going to parties and looking for a partner. -What? -Boys are the same, right? Lately, even I've been asked out by a lot of guys. -Could it be... -But there's already this guy I like. That's why she's been coming home so late recently? For the time being, I can only work at night. But even if I work all day after winter break starts on the 24th... Ah... How long will it take to pay back the $12,000? Oh... I know what to do. Mom. MOM No, no, no... I've got to deal with this myself. Nine dollars an hour... If I work eight hours a day... What? That's all I'll make? No! Oh, dear. What should I do? It'll never happen. I don't know what to do. Ahh... I can't handle this. -Thank you. -Thank you for coming. Here we are. Here's your miso ramen. It's such a pleasure seeing your smiling face, Nao. Oh, come on. Give me a break. Excuse me. Could I get some water? Sure. I'll be there in a second. In spite of everything, she's fitting right in. Why don't you take a quick break, Nao? Well... I just don't feel right not working. I mean, I broke seven dishes in three days and I wasted five bowls of ramen. It's no big deal at all. Yes, it is a big deal, Dad. -Welcome. -Hi, Nao. Marina. Mitsuishi. You came. Look at you, Nao. That's one crazy outfit. But it oddly suits her. Well... I hate to admit it, but I agree. Actually, we've brought along a special guest. Really? -We really just ran into him outside. -Don't say that. Yo. Daichi. Let's eat. We're done. That was delicious. You've got quite an appetite, miss. Oh, wow! What a nice looking guy! -That's Issei, the bully. -I see. Call me Icchan. All the customers do. That was really good, Icchan. It's really hard to believe Nao's working a part-time job. She believed in Santa Claus until she was a sixth grader. What? Seriously? Every year, my dad dressed up as Santa for Nao's sake. It wasn't easy for me to act like I was happy too. You sure have a knack for making people fret over you. Sorry. It just shows how happy it made us to see your reaction. She would get all excited over each little present. That's right. Ever since I was little, I really looked forward to seeing what present Daichi would get me. I liked the prize more than the candy it came with. I liked the picture on the box more than the game inside. He always knew exactly what would please me. Nao! -Yes? -Quit slacking off. -Get going. -Sorry. Enjoy yourselves. -Nao. -Yes? If you don't have any plans for Christmas Eve, would you like to spend it together? You can get it off from the ramen shop, right? Yeah. It is a yearly tradition, after all. I look forward to your mom's juicy hamburger steaks. This year, why don't we spend it alone together? Huh? The family party is fine, but I thought you'd like that kind of thing better, Nao. -You don't have-- -Shh! Go! What's wrong? Is that Uehara? I don't want him to see me like this. Don't you dare tell Uehara that I'm working this job. OK. Whew. Thank goodness. Let's go. Ow! Hey, Nao! How many times have I told you to pick up your stuff? Hey... Wake up. I'm home. Hi. Welcome back. You OK? I'm fine. Just a little tired. What is it? Such a nice smell. Huh? Pork soup base with Japanese broth. Ah! Hey! Cut that out. I'm tired. First I'll take a bath. Oh, would you like to go somewhere on the 24th? What? I got the day off from work. Did you hear me? Oh... Yes, I see. OK... Where are we going? Where should we go? Oh... We could have dinner here. Then we could see the Christmas lights and take a walk. OK, that's it. That's what we'll do. What's with her? Yes! "Would you like to go somewhere on the 24th? I got the day off from work." Yes! Yes! Ow! Ow! Yes! Well done! I can hardly believe it! You're spending Christmas Eve with our school's pride and joy, a super-rare, high-class stud. Uehara just happened to get the day off from work. That's all. He just kind of wondered if I wanted to go somewhere, I think. I don't particularly care if we do or not. Yeah, yeah. Whatever, whatever. You can finally move on from Daichi, huh? Oh, no! Daichi is at a training camp until tomorrow. Oh, I see. Thank you. I think it'll be fine. Daichi did say, "If you don't have any plans," right? Yes. But he said he wanted to spend it alone together this year. He just means spending it together like siblings would, right? I mean, Daichi is one of the top three studs. He could easily find someone to spend Christmas Eve with. In fact, I'm surprised you've been friends for ten years. Anyway, I'll keep trying to get hold of him. Oh, wow! I am so happy for you. The day is coming soon when you won't be faking it anymore, but you'll really be his girlfriend. I knew it. You're faking it. Huh? Whoa, Abe! -Where'd you come from? -Listen. I haven't been able to get Nao out of my head. My, you're unusually slow getting over it this time. How could it possibly be true? There's no way you're dating Uehara. Nao, I don't know why you're doing it but don't you feel it's meaningless to fake being Uehara's girlfriend? If so, then I-- Aah! Keep quiet, Abe! How about you and I go to a party on Christmas Eve, OK? There'll be swarms of cute girls there. -Well, I'd rather-- -Shut up. Forget her, OK? How pretty. What? $390. That's so expensive. Oh, Yuri. What are you up to? -Ah... -Yes? Yep, I think this one suits you best. -But-- -Don't you like it? OK, then this is my Christmas present to you. Really? No, I can't take this-- It's one of my old ones, so don't worry about it. Are you sure it's OK? Uh-huh. Now, as for the food, he likes meat. But as for soup, he likes seafood. He likes any kind of pasta. I see... The soup should be seafood. OK, got it. Oh... but I'm not really... There's no need to play dumb, Nao. I can see you're in love. It's written all over your face. But what's the point in admitting that I am? Why do you say that? You know what I'm talking about, Yuri. You told me his heart isn't so easily moved. That's true. but if he made you his girlfriend that's exactly why he'd treat you with very special care. Hi. Can you give Nao a message? Tell her I'll come get her tomorrow, Christmas Eve, just past noon. Tomorrow, Christmas Eve? That's right. Our families get together every year on Christmas Eve. But I've decided she and I would spend it together this year. I've decided that's how it will be from now on. Later. Welcome home. So, about tomorrow, I was thinking of having dinner early. Nah, I've got work tomorrow. OK, then I'll have it ready by six o'clock tomor... What? Hey! What did you just say? I've got work tomorrow. But... Why? You already had something planned, right? You should have told me you were doing something with that senior. Senior? You mean Daichi? I plan on turning down Daichi-- You celebrated with him every year, right? There is no point for me to go out of my way and worry over you. Worry over me? You invited me out because you were worried about me? On top of faking like we're dating, I've caused you other problems too. What's that supposed to mean? What makes you think you're responsible? What? Weren't you panicking over it? Along with that girl, Marina, weren't you looking for a date for Christmas Eve? What? No, I wasn't. Then... why have you been coming home so late recently? Well... Well what? I had work. Work? Where? At a cafe... near the station. You look like you're lying. I'm not. Well, I don't really understand it, but Christmas Eve is special to girls, right? You bet it is. It's very special. It's a day you spend having fun and eating cake with the people who are special to you, whether it's a sweetheart or family. It can't be just anyone. It matters who you spend it with. Then... it must be nice having him around. Oh, just forget it! What's with her? Dammit! Let's ask these people. Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. -You're all couples, right? -Yes. How sweet. We asked people on the street who they would be spending Christmas Eve with. The number one answer was, of course, with a sweetheart. More than 60 percent gave that answer. How pretty. Uehara... Daichi. I heard your message turning me down, but you sounded kind of depressed. Oh, yeah... I'm sorry. Did I cause you trouble? No. Come on in. Merry Christmas. How about a delicious, -homemade Christmas cake? -Please be careful with the box. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Are you sure you want to work? You had the day off. Of course it's OK. He wants to spend Christmas Eve with someone that's special to him. Isn't that right? Who do you mean by "someone special"? Oh. How about a Christmas cake? It's very special. It's a day you spend having fun and eating cake with the people who are special to you, whether it's a sweetheart or family. It can't be just anyone. It matters who you spend it with. Sorry... that I'm not someone special. I can't believe it. Thirty-eight point five degrees? How could you not notice? You can be so dense sometimes. I've really been pushing myself lately. -Here. -Thank you. I'll make you some porridge, but is there anything else you'd like? A cake. You can have cake after you get over this cold. I want to eat a nice, round cake. The typical strawberry cake that we always had at your house. We'd all sit around it, laughing and singing. Thank you, Daichi. Huh? For spending it with me every year. Thanks to you, I've never once felt lonely on Christmas Eve. Thank you. One cake, please. OK. Nao says she wants to eat one... like this. That'll be $33. I've always known pretty much everything that Nao likes. What? On Christmas, she likes chicken and potage soup. She likes that really typical stuff. Why are you telling me this? But today, she prepared rolled cabbage and seafood soup. Even though she's sick, she went out of her way to make them. What are you trying to tell me? She's not the type to complain. She never has been. But she's got a fever now, and said she's lonely. Huh? If you made her a promise, then you'd better keep it. You're the greatest, Daichi. Open your eyes. Wow! It's a Hokkori Man sticker. I thought you'd like it. How did you know? I just know. I know everything you like, Nao. You're the greatest, Daichi! Nao. I'm coming in. Uehara. Lie back down. What about your work? I took off after hearing what he had to say. Who? Daichi? Nao. Yes? I know you've got a fever now, but... Huh? Oh... uh... That's... for my job... at the ramen shop. Ramen shop? You mean you weren't working at a cafe near the station. No. Why did you make up such a stupid thing? -I couldn't help it. -Why? Sometimes you don't want people to see you looking a certain way. Why? If you saw me delivering ramen when I was dressed like this, you'd make fun of me. Yeah, it is pretty awful looking. That outfit... isn't anything to brag about either. What? Stop laughing. You're the only one that I didn't want to see me like that. Why? I mean, we see each other every day. I'm adding one more rule to the list. Really? Don't put on an act. Lean on others when you need to. I could have helped you and prevented you from getting sick. Who was it that collapsed the other day? That's not important. Are you going to follow the rules? Yes. Oh! -Is that a cake? -Yeah. That's great. Can I look? But no eating until your fever goes down. OK. Uh-oh. Crap. I shouldn't have run. Hey! Don't! I said no eating. See. I bet you're feeling sick now, aren't you? No. It's delicious. But if he made you his girlfriend that's exactly why he'd treat you with very special care. I'm fine with the way things are now. Huh? I'm fine just like this. You can't stay like that. Your fever's still super high. You're right. I'm going to have a taste of this. Hey! Hey, Nao. I got some milk pudding. I'm feeling better, so I'm going for a walk in the park. Nao. What? What did you want to see me for, Nao? I thought I should tell you the truth, Abe. You mean, you want to date me? It's just like you said. Uehara and I aren't dating. Really? Uehara doesn't have any feelings for me. Then, you mean... But... I like Uehara. Huh? I like... Uehara. Oh! THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
