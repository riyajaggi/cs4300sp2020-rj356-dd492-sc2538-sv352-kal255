 Yuri. Yuri? Yuri. So she's Uehara's girlfriend. Ouch! What're you whining about? Pulling a disappearing act like that! Do you realize how worried we were about you? Ow! -How dare you click your tongue at me? -Let go of me! You lost weight again, didn't you? No I didn't.

 -You look like a zombie. -It's just the lighting. I bet you're just eating junk, aren't you? It's way better than your cooking. Hey, I'm still sick! Which is why I'm telling you to come back home. We'll have a proper talk together about your future and-- No way. What? You know, I don't think you even have the right to talk like that. Whose fault do you think it was that I left? Hmm? Let me think. -Hey! -I'm just kidding. In any case, if you're going to wreck your health because you're living alone, then I'm dragging you back home.

 You don't even know where I live. The doctor told me. I couldn't help it. They asked me. You blabber. How dare you scold the person you owe your life to? Would you cut it out with the hitting? You ungrateful smart-ass! I am not ungrateful. Then at least try to act it. Why you! OK, I'll be going now. OK. Hey, at least thank her. Thanks... for all your help. It's OK. Take care of yourself. Yeah. Ah! Wait a second. Let's go together. I want to ask you about Hisashi. I want to go to tell the doctor thanks. Wait for me in the lobby, OK? OK. That was a wedding ring, right? Wait! That means... they're having an affair? An affair... Uehara and that pretty woman... We can't. I have a husband-- Yuri. I want you to be mine. Hisashi. No, no, no! That... that's for grownups! For adults! But... Uehara seemed so right in that scene. What's wrong? Are you feeling sick? Oh... no. I'm fine. I'm Uehara Yuri. Here's my card. My number's on it. Thank you. Uehara Oh, I'm Hisashi's sister-in-law. His older brother is Takuya. He's my husband. Now I see. What? Uehara and his sister-in-law are having an aff... Huh? I'm Yoshikawa Nao. Nao. That's a pretty name. Thank you for taking care of Hisashi. No problem. You're his girlfriend, right? What? Whose girlfriend? Hisashi's. You're Hisashi's girlfriend. No, no! Not at all. We're just classmates. What? Really? That's unusual. There's not many people he's that relaxed with so I totally thought you were. I wouldn't call it relaxed. More like insulting. Oh! I have an idea! Nao, can you also tell him to come back home? Huh? He doesn't listen to a word I say. He's a real smart-ass, that man-brat. Man-brat? That's my nickname for Hisashi. He looks older than he is, but inside he's still a brat. So I call him man-brat. I see. He sure is. Uh-oh. I've got to get back to the office. What? Now? Uh-huh. I'm an editor at an information magazine. It's always like this before a deadline. It's a real pain. Bye. Yuri sure was cool. She's beautiful as well. I wonder if I'll be like that in a few years too? The hell you will. Huh? Is he... Damn him! I got so used to hearing his insults. You're such a jerk, Uehara! Wait a minute... He's coming back, isn't he? He's not going back to his home, right? See ya! Huh? W... wait! Wait! This month's $1,500, please. Ah! No! No way! I can't pay! What'll I do? I'll keep Uehara here by winning him over with food. The amount of food is more important than the taste. I'll make him tons of dishes. Popular Recipes for Restoring Health and Building Strength STAMINA BUILDING POTATO SALAD Let's see now... Oh, that scared me. Yum! MEGUROGAOKA HIGH SCHOOL They're really dating? What a shock! Totally! How could Uehara choose Yoshikawa? Can you believe it? Yo! Morning, Daichi. -Morning. -Morning. Good morning, Marina. Hiro, did you prep for Algebra II? Yeah, I did. Uh, there's a part I wanted to ask about. Where? We've got Music next. Let's go together. Huh? Hey, Marina. What? I'm sorry... Daichi. -Nao. -Yes? Uh, nothing... I just... -Nao, are you-- -Marina's getting away. Sorry. We can talk later. -Eek! -Eek! Darn you! Quit following me. How come you're ignoring me? Because you lied to me. You really are Uehara's girlfriend. She is my girlfriend. How did you find out? Uehara of the top three has a girlfriend. That kind of news spreads like wildfire. -But, you see-- -Don't get me wrong. I'm not angry that you're Uehara's girlfriend. What? I'm pissed at you because you lied to me that there was nothing between you two. I know it's not easy to tell me because I'm always talking about Uehara. But you and I have known each other for so much longer. And I thought I was your best friend. It's like you're putting up a front, but in your heart, you're blowing me off. Marina... How come you're going to cry? I'm sorry. Tell me everything from now on, OK? I'll tell you everything about me too. -OK. -Good. -I... -Yes? To tell the truth, we're pretending to be dating. What? Oh. Class is going to start. Huh? Hey! Hey, Wait! You'd better fill me in later! Wait! Hold on a second! You mean you and Uehara are living there together? Hey! Who told you? That's right. So to keep people from finding out that they're living together, he said to pretend that they're dating. I thought he was a Prince Charming, but she says he's a stuck-up jerk. Yeah, that's absolutely right! What's worse, he's got everyone fooled. Isn't he awful, Mitsuishi? Uh, but don't you think the bigger problem is the fact you're living with a guy? There haven't been any problems yet. What're you talking about? Of course there has. Are you taking that to Uehara at the hospital? Yep. It's part of my plan to use food to keep him from leaving. So you were up all night cooking. How did you know? Rings under your eyes. He's such a big eater, I thought I'd better make a lot. It took forever. You know, Nao, I think you like Uehara. What? Of course I don't! I never said anything like that. That's what's called getting to a man's heart through his stomach. I see. I told you I'm not! Uehara has a real girlfriend. -What? -What? Who? His older brother's wife. She's super pretty. So cheerful and kind too. Competent at her job as well. A real grown-up woman. I'm not visiting him. Why not? Because she can take care of him. Yep. She'll do it. She'll take care of him, so I'm not. I'm going to eat this myself. I'm not going. Nope. Not going. Everyone I know is so blind to love. You are too. Did you say something? No. Maybe I'll just look in on him. God damn him! Yo. What's that supposed to mean? You could at least tell me you were released. I don't have your number. Oh... ADDED TO MY CONTACTS Here. Don't always be contacting me. I hate Line and texting. Why would I contact you if I didn't have a reason? What's that? Oh... That's your dinner. I'll have it for a midnight snack. You should have dinner before that. Don't tell me that... You ate it all! Hey! You broke the rules! You ate my food without permission! Oh... I'm recovering so I made an exception. What? That ticks me off! Who said he could make an exception? And how can he eat that much when he's supposed to be recovering? He actually did come back here. Darn it all. And I was enjoying living alone so much. Oh, that's right. MOM It's Mom. Are you eating nutritiously? You wouldn't believe it, but I'm cooking for myself. Well, that's good to hear. Oh. You're not forgetting what your real job as a student is, right? I've got that covered too. It's so much easier to study when I'm living alone. Oh, is that so? Are you ready for your next final-- Trust me, Mom. I've changed. I might even make it into the top half of the class. Really? That's great. Your father and I talked this over. If you're not in the top half, then you won't be living alone anymore. OK. Piece of cake. Really? I'm looking forward to it. OK. Bye. Did I really say, piece of cake? When are finals? From Tuesday. Today's Saturday. Saturday, Sunday, Monday. Oh, no! I'm more likely to be out of here than Uehara is. I've got to study! My pencils! Oops! Welcome home. Must be hard working so early. Yeah, thanks. Were you up all night? Tests are coming up. Oh, yeah. Must be tough being stupid. Are you OK? Oh, yeah! I've got you! Uehara! Tutor me, please! -No. -What? -Why not? -It'd be a real pain. And you seem like a poor learner. All it would do is exhaust me. All you do is complain. You really are a man-brat. Did you and Yuri... Forget it. Uehara Yuri's Married-Uehara's Older Brother Oh, no! I haven't made any progress! I can't understand this! I can't understand this! I can't understand... FINALS Sorry, I can't. We've got a practice game today. Oh, I see. Yeah, I guess you're busy. You've always been the type that won't start until you're up against a wall. Summer vacation homework, research projects and book reports. Oh, yeah. Your somersault practice too. You helped me with all those, Daichi. It'd be nice if you appreciated me a little more. I do, Daichi. I totally appreciate what you've done. OK, I'll do it. But I really do need to stop depending on you. Yes? Nothing. Do your best. Bye. OK. Thanks. Bye. That's Yuri. That was close. OA times OB cosine C minus one half, parentheses, A times B... Huh? What was it again? Oh! It's vector. -Huh? -Hey there. Yuri! -Yum! It's delicious! -This is great. It's delicious. I'm so glad I ran into you, Nao. I left him a message to say I was going to drop by but he never called back. Could you call him for me, Nao? I can't get in unless he's there. Oh, I think he's working today. Probably... What? He is? Darn him. Why can't he just call? He's such a pain. Uhm, Yuri... Why don't you call me Yuririn? Yuririn? Right. And you don't have to talk so polite. Then, Yuririn... Yes? What is it? Uhm... Uehara... Is he... Did he say something about me? But... when he's with you, he seems different than usual. He looks so pained. I think I was his first love. Really? Takuya and Hisashi's family and mine were friends, so we got along really well. The three of us would always play around as kids. But when their parents died, they became depressed. I said I'd be their mother instead. So I was always over at their house. Then I fell in love with him... Takuya, I mean. Hisashi is like a little brother to me. I had absolutely no clue that he had a crush on me. Not long after, we got married and I was living in the Uehara house. He told me. "I can't live with the woman I like and her husband." It must have been hard for him. I really felt bad about it. But... But, seriously! Takuya and I were newlyweds and so in love. We couldn't help it. If he liked me, then he should have said sooner! Well, I guess that getting drunk and kissing him a bunch probably gave him the wrong idea. What? Oh, dear. I'll kiss anyone when I'm drunk. Oh, really. I'm sure I've kissed Hisashi 20 times. What? 20 times? Are you jealous? No. There's nothing between us-- Yeah, yeah. Sure. OK! Since I've come all this way, I may as well see his place. Huh? What? Wait! Wait! Wait! You forgot this! Hold on! Yes. I'm OK. Seriously, I'm just fine. It's alright. Don't push yourself when you're still ill. I'm good. I really am all better. Take the day off and relax. Bye. Uehara... He hung up? If they're going to cancel, I wish they'd tell us sooner. They said they caught the flu. What? Seriously? See you. -See you later. -See you. Hey! Oh, Daichi. Where are you headed? Nao's place. Our game was cancelled, so I'm going over to tutor her. Later. Nao's place? Uh... There'll be trouble if Uehara's there. Serious trouble. Daichi's kind of old-fashioned. If he found out that Nao and Uehara are living together... What would happen? Run, Mitsuishi! Oh, my god! Seriously? Let's jump rope. Come on, Mitsuishi. Hurry up! Yes? Yo! -Uh... -Uh... Who are you? Isn't this Yoshikawa Nao's place? God damn her. Aren't you the junior, Uehara? Yeah. What of it? What are you doing in Nao's place? Hello there! We're coming in, Uehara. What're you two doing? Leave this to us. Huh? Hey! Hey! I'm not finished talking to you! Daichi, don't get so worked up, OK? Hey, guys! I've got milk tea. Why don't we take a break? -Hey! That's mine! -What? -Give it back. Give it back. -Wait! Stop! Uehara! Are you and Nao-- I'm drinking this! That's mine. Don't you dare! Who cares about that-- Now, now. Take a deep breath. Get out of my way, Mitsuishi! Oh! Look at all these people! What fun! -Nice to meet all of you. -Nao! I'm Hisashi's sister-in-law, Yuri. Nao... -God damn you! -Are you all Hisashi's friends? Of course they're not! Really? Nao, are you Uehara's girlfriend? Uh... Daichi! Daichi! Nao's living with him, but she's not his girl-- What? Living together? You're living with Hisashi? I knew it! You're his girlfriend. No, I'm not! We are living together-- Pretend! They're pretending dating! That's right! Why do you have to live together if you're just pretending? Wait a minute! Are you after her body, Hisashi? After her body? -No way! How shameful! -It's total chaos! What the hell are you thinking-- Shut up! I'll tell you everything. So everybody, just shut up. Ow! That's the story. All of it. Yay! I've got no interest in her at all. Damn, you're awfully frank. She feels the same about me. We're simply living together. Right? Yes... That's exactly right. Besides, she's moving to the dorms in April. And I plan to save enough money to move by then. So I'd like to continue... living together like this. Uhm... This is the first time... Uehara and I have lived alone. We're trying to figure things out, so we're alike in that. I'm not like you. We always fight, but since we're alike, we understand each other. It's reassuring. So, I know you're worried about us, but... please let us continue living together. Please. Please. Yuri. I'm sorry I kept it secret that we were living together. It doesn't bother me at all. I understand what Hisashi's situation is. Since it's with you, Nao, I feel good about it. Yuri. OK, see you later. Take care of Hisashi. -Nao. -Yes? I thought Uehara and Yuri were having an affair. -I misunderstood. -How could you do that? Well, I was half right. Huh? What? I can't understand your way of thinking at all. Huh? How can you live with a total stranger? And she's a girl too? -What business is it of yours? -Are you doing this because it's Nao? Because you think she'll be easy to control? And so what if I do? You're the type that hurts others without even knowing it. What does that mean? Exactly like it sounds. Oh! Daichi... You're angry, aren't you? I'm really sorry I didn't tell you. If anything happens, you come straight over to my place. OK. Thanks for everything. Christ! You've been nothing but trouble for me. How dare you! Quit acting like it's all my fault. You brought them all over here, right? Yes. I'm sorry. Well, at least it all worked out. Huh? What? High five. Ow! Why do you have to use such force? Anyway, we can breathe a little easier now. You really are happy-go-lucky. I'm going to bed. Oh, no! What's wrong? -Tests... -Huh? If I don't get a good score on my tests, I'll have to go back home. Are you kidding me? I told you before! How come you can't understand this? I can't help it if I can't understand. It's not my fault. Use the formula, damn it. I told you too! There are so many formulas. There's one here too. It's this one. -Which one? -Not that one. It's so hard! What? It's your head that's hard. -Cut it out! That hurt. -How come you can't... FINALS First day of finals AFTER FINALS -Chiho Yoshida. -Yes. -Atsushi Yonekawa. -Yes. CLASS RANK: 12 GRADE RANK: 87 out of 176 Eighty-seven out of 176 One above the half-way line. I did it! I'm in! I did it! I did it! I did it, Uehara! 87th place! I won't have to go back to the countryside! Just barely. That sure was close. To thank you, I'll treat you something nice. You want milk pudding? Yeah. Premium milk pudding. Got it. MILK PUDDING, PREMIUM MILK PUDDING Yes! I'm in luck. Huh? What? Hey! Wait! What? You're getting them all? -Come on. -What? Wait! -They've got big size too. -What? Ah! Oh! That's good too. -Start with rock! -Rock! -Rock-paper-scissors! -Rock-paper-scissors! -It's a tie! -It's a tie! -It's a tie! -It's a tie! -Ah... -Yes! Come on. Me again? Oh, alright. -Thank-- -Here. Here. "Here! Here!" What a jerk! Damn it! So heavy... They're so heavy. Could you please carry just one? Just one. Please carry just one. Oh, alright. I'll carry these potato sticks. What? Hey! Here you go. -OK. Let's eat. -Let's eat. Don't copy me. You too. Besides, I thought you wanted premium. You bought so many of them. You've got to start with the plain first. What? That doesn't make any sense at all. -First come, first served. -Ah! Hey! It's delicious! What? You can have half. I bought it for myself in the first place. INCOMING YURI It's Yuri. You're not going to answer? I've got nothing to talk about. Even if you don't, Yuri might-- Shut up. Yum. You're just like an elementary school boy. What? The kind that teases the girl he likes. That's not what I meant. Sorry. What're you apologizing for? You're right? Why am I? Uehara, you like Yuri, don't you? Sorry. Go ahead and eat all of them. I've got to tell Mom about my tests. Good night. It's so clear... Uehara... has always liked Yuri. What the... Why am I... That day was the first time I realized that I might be in love with Uehara. THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
