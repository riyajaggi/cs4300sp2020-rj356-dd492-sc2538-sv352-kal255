 Dad! Mom! -Welcome home, Nao. -You're looking healthy. What are you doing here? We were invited to a wedding. And we wanted to see you, Nao. Are you eating well? You look like you've lost a little weight. No, I'm perfectly fine. If you're going to come, then you've got to tell me. Your father wanted to surprise you. I don't need that kind of surprise.

 Why not? Do you have a secret we'll find out if we drop in suddenly? Oh, no... Of course there's nothing like that. Who is that? Uhm... He's from school... You mean he's... -Your homeroom teacher? -Huh? Oh, please. That's obviously a school uniform. Oh, dear me! I was just kidding. He looks so adult-like. Uhm... This is Uehara Hisashi. He goes to the same school. He just happens to live in the same building. Right? Oh, yes. Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Uehara. Wow, this is a really nice place, isn't it? So this is your room.

 Oh, you know, the place is a real mess. So, could you come back later? Oh, that's right! Uehara works at a cafe near the station. Why don't we all go there? What are you talking about? I knew it'd be a mess, so I brought my apron. I'll clean the place up quickly so we've got a place to sleep. -Yep. -What? You mean you're staying the night here? Of course we are. No! No! Impossible! No way! What are you talking about? What's wrong with us staying at our daughter's place? There's nothing wrong with it, but the place is so small. Huh? I thought you said it was quite large. Oh! I don't have any comforters for you! No problem. I rented comforters so they'd arrive today. It's so convenient nowadays. It's just a simple click on the Internet. Wait! Wait! Hold on a minute! I've got to clean the place up! Nao, we don't care if it's a mess. I said wait a minute! I do care! KING RAMEN MEN'S Can't have this here. That's no good. Such a beautiful place! This is pretty big! You've got to be kidding if you think this is small! -Come on in, Uehara. -Oh, thank you. There are no mountains to look at, so I don't feel quite at home. We've forgotten what it's like living in the city. You're right. RULES Hey, Nao! There must be something wrong with this place if it's only $800. That's what I thought at first too. But they had reasons for it being $800. Reasons? Uh, well... The landlady is a really nice person. Oh, I'd love to meet her. Well, maybe next time. Is that your room, Nao? -Huh? -Oh! Oh, my! Look! You're keeping it so clean! You think so? And you're studying properly too, I see. Well, yeah. What's this over here? Ah! Wait! This is U... Huh? Uu? -Uu... -Uu? Walk-in-closet! My! There sure is a lot of storage space. The closet walks? It's just where I keep extra stuff. It's a big mess, so don't you dare go in. -OK, OK. -I can at least have a look? Dad! This is my own place, OK? OK, fine. What's wrong? Uh, uhm... This is mental training. -Ah! -Huh? What? What's the matter? -I got a little light-headed. -Really? Are you OK? -Paper! Here! -Paper hair? On the floor! Are you all right? Oh, I'm fine. It was nothing. That's good to hear. You're awfully young to be getting light-headed. You're absolutely right. "Men's"? What's this, Nao? I... uh... Oh, yeah. That dumb friend of yours is into that, right? Dumb friend? Uhm, I mean... Nao's good friend... I've got to use your restroom! Ah! This is the bath! My place has the same layout. The toilet is over there. Ah! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Here you go. -Here you are, Uehara. -Thank you. If I'd known there was such a handsome guy here, I would have brought a souvenir. Well, instead of a souvenir, I do have my special croquettes. I told her not to bring them because they're just extra weight. She wanted you to have them so badly, she got up at three o'clock. But I guess I could have made them here. I didn't know if I'd have time or the utensils to do it. They look delicious, don't they? After eating these, I decided to marry her. -Really? -Not that story again. Dad always tells this story when Mom makes croquettes. I made a lot of other more difficult dishes, didn't I? But it was the croquettes that won over my stomach. You can't get croquettes better than this anywhere. And they're even better since they're made with potatoes we grew. Here, have one. No, I can't, really. Please, help yourself. I can make more. It appears she's cooking for herself, so I've got all the things I need here. Mom, you've got to teach me how to make these. Oh! Have you gotten a boyfriend? There's no way that's possible, right, Nao? Uh... yeah. I just can't recreate the taste of these. Of course not. You see, it's my trade secret! Really? Uehara, are you one of Nao's schoolmates? Schoolmates? We have different homerooms. Do you live here with your family? No, I live away from my family. Uehara lives alone too. Oh, I see. Do you often... come here to visit? This is my first time. Oh, I see. Uehara is so busy with work that he hardly ever comes home. He leaves early in the morning and comes home late so he goes straight to bed when he gets home, right? You sure know him well. Uh... well... We sometimes come home from work at the same time. That reminds me, you're working at a ramen shop, aren't you, Nao? I'd really like to see you at work there. Uh, sorry, it's nothing. The ramen is so good that it makes you laugh, isn't it? With having to work morning and night, are your grades all right? -Uehara's at the top of the class. -Really? Wow! That's amazing! Nao, you should have Uehara be your tutor. -What? -Ow! That's hot! -Oh, dear! Oh, dear! -What are you talking about? -Are you OK, Dad? -Yeah, I'm sorry. Uhm, I've got to get to work pretty soon. Oh, yeah. That's right. Hold on a minute. You said that this was the first time you've been here. Huh? How did you know this had tissues in it? This looks like nothing more than a stuffed animal! Actually, he does sometimes come help me study and has dinner here. I'm very sorry. -What? -Huh? What are you doing, Uehara? Nao and I are dating. Oh, really? You should have told us, Nao. But we only started just recently. That was a surprise. I'm the one who's surprised. What's wrong with you? Why didn't you say so? -I'm sorry. -There's no need to apologize. I'm so happy that Nao's got a boyfriend. OK, Uehara. Time to go to work, right? Uhm, but I've still got things to say. Her father's a bit flustered right now. Let's go. I've got to pull myself together. Wait right there! I want an explanation. I'm very sorry. We were the victims of a double-contract scam and just happened to move in here on the exact same day. A scam! Why didn't you tell us about such an important thing? I didn't want to cause you any extra worry. -Extra worry? -No matter the reason, you kept it secret from your parents, that you're living with another student. I will never allow it. I'm taking Nao back home with us. We'll worry about the rest later. Dad! This is exactly why I was opposed to you living alone in the first place! But, it's a little late now-- This wouldn't have happened if you hadn't approved of it. What? Are you saying this is my fault? You're the one who said that she'd have problems in the future if she didn't learn how to cook and clean. So you said she should experience living on her own! I said living alone was OK, not living with a guy! Then why are you getting angry at me? Because you've always spoiled Nao. You're the last person I want to hear that from. Why? You're the one who always spoiled Nao! You'd give her spending money without telling me and let her eat as much candy as she wanted. Thanks to that, Nao's always had tons of cavities. -Why are we talking about this? -Cut it out! I will leave. Huh? Uehara? I'll go back to my home for the time being. I apologize for all of this. I want an explanation. I already told you. Don't talk to me like that. But you won't believe me no matter what I say, Dad! What are you talking about? It's exactly because I believe you that I want to know the truth. What's with you sleeping with that scrawny guy? Not sleeping together. Living together. -It's the same. -No, it's not. I can't pay the $1,500 rent, so it couldn't be helped. Couldn't be helped? You're being deceived by him! Wake up to that fact, would you? Uehara isn't that kind of person! Everybody knows that handsome guys are rotten at the core. What are you talking about? You're just jealous! Jeal... What are you talking about? I may not be now, but I used to be pretty darn good looking! Who cares about that? You're changing the subject! At any rate, I will not allow it, ever! But if you insist on continuing to live here... then I'll sever our ties with you! Dear! If you still want to live with him after that, then do what you like! I hate you, Dad! CAFE Uehara! Oh no! What're you doing? I was rejected again. Holy crap! That's worse than me getting rejected. A million times worse. That's rough! It would be bad enough meeting your girlfriend's parents under normal circumstances. So, that's what it's like? -Well, I've never had that chance. -I didn't think so. But my own mom, she'd be totally happy if I got a girlfriend. -Oh, sorry. -About what? But seriously, though, what are you going to do? There's a room open on the second floor at one of my jobs. So at least I've got a place to move to. Are you sure that's OK? Well, Nao was in quite a panic. -I mean, are you going to be OK? -Huh? You'll be separated from Nao. But if Nao's free, maybe I'll ask her to date me again. Ow! That seriously hurt, Uehara! Hey! Ow, that really hurt. YOSHIKAWA NAO Wow! It finally happened. So what did your parents say? My dad was totally pissed off. He said he's taking me back home. I see. Wait! That means you'll transfer out! No! Please don't do that! I don't want that either! But he said he'd sever relations with me if I didn't. Wow! That's brutal. What about your mom? It's odd. Mom's awfully cool about it. It's actually kind of scary. Yeah, I guess it makes sense. No girl's parents are OK with their daughter living with a guy. I don't know what to do. In any case, one of you should probably move. Though that won't settle everything. What about Uehara? What's he doing now? He went to his brother's for the time being. I see. I can't see him at home and at school on break. Must be lonely. And it's going to be like this for a long time too, right? But you and him have it good. When school's on break Mitsuishi and I can only meet once every three days. I guess we've had it too good until now. Yep. It's the landlady. You'd better answer. Hello? Nao works real hard. She's our shop's fresh young face. Oh, you must be kidding. At home, she always left the place a mess. And even when she occasionally helped me with cooking, she'd break dishes and cut her fingers. She broke a ton when she first started. But lately she's down to breaking only one a day. Really? I'd love to have her as my daughter-in-law. -Oh, come on, Dad! -I'm just saying that how good she is. She really is honest, serious and a great worker. I'm so glad to hear that. Would you like a kaedama, sir? What's that? A refill. He'll fill your bowl with more ramen, right? Right. OK, I'll have a kaedama. -One kaedama! -Coming right up! Just look at that smile! All Nao's friends have become regular customers. I really appreciate it. -Dad! -What? How come you told the landlady you're cancelling the contract? This isn't just my home. All I told her was that you're leaving. If he wants to live here, then he can. But Uehara's got special circumstances. What do I care? So you don't care what happens to Uehara? It has nothing to do with our family. You're awful. Nao. I hate your guts, Dad! -Where are you going, Nao? -I don't care. Anywhere but here. There's no way I'm going back home with Dad! Nao! Dear! It's none of my concern. Let her do what she wants. Dear! CAFE Nao! Uehara. What are you doing here? -I ran away. -What? Come over here. What the hell are you thinking? Dad says he's going to cancel the rental agreement and take me back home. There's no way I'll stand for that! Nao. Let me stay at your brother's place. I don't want to see my dad anymore. He's talking about severing relations with me if we keep living together. I will sever relations with him! That stupid blockhead! I'm taking you back to the apartment. -What? -Go back. You mean you're all right with me going back to my parents' place? So, you won't be lonely? You're OK with not seeing me anymore? How come you won't say anything? Am I the only one who wants to stay together forever? Nao. I don't want you to run away from home. I want you to go back and apologize to your father. -No. -Nao! Don't ever say you'll sever relations with your parents. I'll be thinking about what to do for our future too. OK? Welcome. -Just a party of one. -Go ahead. Sit wherever you like. -I'm home. -Oh, hi. Huh? Hey Dad, where's Uehara? Oh, now that you mention it, he's not here yet. Aw, darn it all. Oh. Hello. Thank you for waiting. Here you are. Uhm, is that Uehara you mentioned Uehara Hisashi? Yes. Oh, are you an acquaintance? Oh, uh, yes. Are you a relative of his? Ah... uh, yes, kind of... Oh, is that so? What a surprise. It's nice to meet you. I'm Kusanagi. You know, he's a really hard worker. I worry about him, so sometimes I feel like I should treat him like I were his father. Like his father? Oh, I'm sorry. That was awfully presumptuous of me. I didn't know he had any relatives nearby. It's OK. I'm sorry. When I heard that his parents died when he was little and he was an orphan, I wondered if there was any way that I could help him. Oh, but he does have an older brother. But he's already got a family of his own, and he's going to be transferred overseas soon. But it's not that easy to do what he does. Earning money to live off of by himself... And he's got great grades as well. He's so serious and a hard worker. Let's go. It's from the cafe. Go ahead and go to work. Don't worry. I'll go back like you said. I'll be fine. Thank you. No, I can't do this. Nao. Mom. Welcome home, Nao. I thought you'd run away from home. Uehara told me to come back. But I have no intention of going back home with you. I want to graduate from this high school. And I don't want to leave my friends. Dear, I'm against forcing Nao to come back home. Mom. I can't forgive you for not telling us that you were living with him, but I know that there were unavoidable circumstances for both of you. What circumstances? Uehara lost his parents when he was little, and his only family is his older brother. How did you find that out? Why didn't you tell us that before? That the both of you started living together only after worrying a lot over whether you should. I'm asking you too, dear. I don't want you to do anything rash like forcing her to suddenly move out like this. I think we should spend a little more time before coming to a decision about this. Oh, Mom. I want to trust you, Nao. Besides, dear, you're unhappy just because Nao got herself a boyfriend, right? Nao, fathers will always object to whatever boys their daughters bring home. And it's even worse the more handsome he is. Jeez! You women always end up conspiring together so easily. You may have succeeded in sweet-talking your mother into this, but you won't be able to win me over so easily. But I haven't sweet-talked her at all. That's right. You always get suspicious so easily. I can't stand this. Where are you going? We'll be having dinner soon. -I won't need it. -Dad! CAFE -Manager. -Uh-huh? Sorry, but can I finish up now today? Sure. What's up? There's someone that I have to talk to. Welcome! I was just on my way to go talk to you. Did you think you could have a proper talk on an empty stomach? You're right. You're very frank. Sorry. Huh? Croquettes again? These are the best way to put your father in a good mood. Besides, you want to learn how to make the Yoshikawa special croquette, right? -Yeah! -Yeah! Oh! That's hot! -Oh, you! Here, use a washcloth. -Okay. -Those will burn you. -Thank you. I think your father can understand the difficulties Uehara's going through. My father was completely opposed to me going to university. But I wanted to go to university in Tokyo so badly so I ran away from home. When I was a student, I had to earn my tuition and everything myself. Back then, that was the norm. But now, it's different for students. Oh, I'm not old enough. Oh, that's right. You're still in high school. Yeah, still. -Here we go! -What? For the Yoshikawa family special croquettes, I put in a little bit of whipping cream here. Wow! So that's the secret behind their fluffiness! Oh, dear! I've given away your mother's trade secret! -Mom? -Uh-huh? I'm sorry. You said you didn't want to cause us any extra worry because of the scam. But, you see, parents want extra worry. Think of how lonely I'd be if you didn't cause me to worry. Oh, Mom. You want to keep living here with Uehara, don't you, Nao? Uh-huh. All right. But I want you to make me one promise. Promise me that you won't lie to me anymore. From now on I'll listen carefully to what you have to say and worry with you, and think things over with you. So I want you to talk to me about anything important in your life. OK. Good. All right. Now shape these into croquettes. Oh, OK! I'm sorry about what happened. Did you want to see me just to apologize? Please allow us to live together. And if I say no? Either way, this will end when there's an opening in the girls' dorm. Then when we graduate, things will change for both of us. But... even if we cannot live together I would still like to be with Nao. I will take good care of her. Do you understand what it means to take good care of someone? Yes. I will never do anything that would cause you to worry about her. That goes without saying. Two kaedama, please! -Huh? -Coming right up! -Two kaedama! -Two kaedama, coming right up! They'll refill your bowl with noodles. They call it kaedama. Didn't you know that? -This one is so cute! I really like it. -The pink one is pretty. -I like it too. -But-- Huh? What's going on? Uehara! Dad! Why are you together? We met by chance at Evening Star Ramen. Oh, honey! Just look at you! Sorry, Uehara. -Oh, honey! -This is really delicious! Evening Star pot stickers! -Eat them while they're hot! -Oh, dear! But I made croquettes! Croquettes? Then I'm having a croquette! Dad, you're drunk! -Nao, get out the comforter. -Ok. -Are you all right? -I'm just fine. You know, when I ate these croquettes, that's what made me decide to marry her. Not that old story again. I'm sorry about this. It's all right. OK, I'll be going now. Oh, but you live here, right, Uehara? Now, I don't know what happened between you two, but I'm certain he's given his permission to allow you to live together. Really? Yes, he has. Only until there's an opening in the girls' dorm. Seriously? Uh-huh. How did you know, Mom? Your father doesn't get drunk around other people. When I saw that, I knew right away. He'd made a decision that he couldn't handle unless he was drunk. Uehara, please take good care of Nao. Yes, ma'am. Can I come in? Uehara, can I borrow one of your alarm clocks? Are you all right? I'm so tired. I think my life's been shortened by three years. Yeah, that was rough. I bet you are tired. It's only natural. But I'm happy. About what? That I was able to talk with your parents. And your dad treated me to ramen. It all makes me happy. Welcome back home... Uehara. I can't believe I got smashed so easily. I must be getting old. It only makes sense that Nao's matured. She couldn't do anything by herself before. Now she cooks and works. She's working as hard as she can. Let's trust Nao, all right? I'm glad we came to Tokyo. My life's been shortened by three years, though. And I was so glad to find out that everyone likes Nao. Yep. She'll be fine. Just fine. -Let's go to sleep. -OK. These are really good. Yum! Hey! That's mine! Does it have your name on it? But how many is that for you? My second, I think. No way. That's a total lie. OK, fine. I'll give you half. Not half. This one is all mine! Hey! Have some cabbage! What? Hey! OK, I'm taking that! How many times are you going to wipe the same place? Oh, sorry, sorry. What are you so happy about? I can't help it. It was always bugging me. Keeping it all a secret from my parents. But from now on, we can be in the open about everything. Yeah, OK, whatever. Nao, you can go whenever you like. OK. -Oh, Issei. -Uh-huh? Can I wait here for a while? Uehara said he was going to meet me here on his way home from work. Go right ahead. Thank you. Welcome! Oh, thanks for coming again. -Issei. -Yes? I... I can't forget about you. Well, uh... I told you this before, but I-- I love you! Please be my boyfriend! I'm sorry, but I can't be your boyfriend. But why not? You don't have a girlfriend now, right? I heard that your only love is ramen, and you don't have a girlfriend. Who said that? Dad! I bet you think that a girl like me isn't a good match for you. No, it's not that. Jeez, what should I do? Hey! What're you doing? This here is my girlfriend! So, I'm sorry, I can't go out with you. Yow! That's hot! I put my hand right in the pot! THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
