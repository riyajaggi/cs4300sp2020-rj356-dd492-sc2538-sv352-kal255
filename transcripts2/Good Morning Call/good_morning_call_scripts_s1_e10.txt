 I'm sorry. Thank you. This is good. Here. My mom gave these to me. It's good. She only bought this because she wants to eat them. This is so sweet. You don't like sweets much, do you, Daichi? But you gave me chocolates every year. That's because if I give you ones that I want to eat

 then I can eat them with you. I think you ate most of them. Daichi. Today, I-- Don't worry. It's OK. If you don't want to talk about it, then don't. You can stay here tonight if you want to. We've got school tomorrow... so I'll go back home today. Yuri... how are you feeling? I heard you have a fever. I thought you were coming home late tonight. Listen to me, Yuri. I'm feeling tired.

 -So we can have dinner out, OK? -I want to tell you everything. I'd like to have soba or something. -Come on, listen. -I don't want to hear it! Hear him out. You can still divorce him after you listen to what he has to say. You stay out of this! Sorry for not telling you about my transfer. I meant to tell you all about it. -Yeah, right. -I did. I'm serious. How can you talk to your ex-girlfriend... but not talk to me about it? Her husband was transferred to live alone overseas, so I wanted to ask her some questions about it. So? What if her husband is overseas? She really has nothing to do with this. I just... I just couldn't tell you, that's all. Couldn't tell me what? I want you to come with me. I know what you'd say. You'd say that you'd throw away your life here and come with me. -Then why-- -But if you did... If you did... you wouldn't be losing just your job... but our home in Japan too. Don't tell me... you were worried about me having a place to stay. I never asked you to do that. Or maybe you were going to let me have Yuri? I knew it. You and your ex-girlfriend are getting on good. It only makes sense. Instead of this crazy drunk, you'd rather be with a woman that understands your work-- -What did you do-- -I told you before. I will never let you have Yuri. Then take her with you! If we go there, we won't be able to come back for three years. You'll have to quit your current job, and we won't be able to see Hisashi. You already know, right? You know what I'll say. Oh, sorry. Uehara. Sorry about the trouble I caused you. Quit being a pussyfoot! That's payback. Nao. Nao. Nao. Sorry. I'm going home. Yuri. So that means Yuri stayed overnight here? UNKNOWN Hello. This is Yoshikawa Nao. -Nao. -Uhm, Uehara... I just found out there's an opening at the girls' dorm from next month. What? They said I could move right in at that time. I didn't expect an opening this soon. Oh, I see. That's good news. It's a little sooner than I planned, but it's OK, right? Nao, -about today-- -Sorry... but I don't want to hear about it. I'm going to sleep for a while. -Oh, come on. Cut that out. -Why? Oh! Good morning! -Oh, Marina. -Good morning. Good morning. So, how was your Valentine's date? Did you tell him? No. What? You mean you didn't tell him? No, it was kind of... Jeez! You look so depressed. -Mitsuishi, you go on ahead. -Huh? Why? -Dang, you're cold. -Just go! -But we were so lovey-dovey yester-- -Mitsuishi! OK. Nao? Yuri, huh? You know, there may have been a good reason for it. Like what? Uh, well... Look, when a friend is truly in trouble, you'd at least want to listen to their problem, right? -But she's not a friend. -Huh? Yuri's not just a friend. I mean, he's always liked her. But, even though he used to like her, she's still his sister-in-law. You wouldn't like it if he were the type of guy who was cold and ignored that kind of thing. Yeah. But... what I hate more is seeing Uehara become all frantic over Yuri. I hate myself for hating Yuri too. And I really hate myself for being so jealous. I'm going all crazy inside! Nao, why don't you stay at my place for a while? I'll listen to you complain about whatever you like. OK? OK. What did you want to talk to me about? What's your problem? I thought you said you told Nao how you felt about her. Then how come she was crying? She was soaking wet, carefully carrying that cake. What's wrong with you? Are you even thinking about Nao's feelings? If you make a promise, then keep it! You got her hopes up and played with her feelings. She just giggles and brushes off whatever you say. Have you ever thought about her feelings? No. No way. I won't let you. I won't let you have Nao. She's the only one who can decide that. I'm not going to back off either. It's a little late to be saying that. I knew letting you two live together was a mistake. There you are. Where's Nao's special lunch? Jeez! I thought I'd be able to get some leftovers. So, how was the cake? You got one from Nao, didn't you? I totally thought I'd get something at least from Nao this year, but, "This year, I'm only giving one to the person I'm serious about." That's what she told me. How was it? Was Nao's true-love cake good? -Oh! -You can have it. What? Really? You haven't had any of it. Nao. Daichi. Do you have a little time right now? Sorry, but I've got work today. I see. Are you all right? Yeah. Nao's going to be staying at my place from today. OK. Thank you, Daichi. No problem. -Bye. -See you. OK. EVENING STAR RAMEN, CLOSED What are all these? They're presents from customers. -They're all for Issei? -Yep. I can't believe you're popular, Issei. Hey, I'm called the "Handsome Manager," you know! -Really? -He takes after me. By the way, did you meet up with him yesterday? -Huh? -Uh... Uehara, is that his name? -He came here yesterday. -Really? He was looking for you. Sorry, but we're still closed. Aren't you Nao's... Has she been here? No, today's her day off. Yeah, I thought so. Thanks. He was kind of frantic. Did you give him the cake? No. I see. Things don't always go so smoothly. I'll be staying over at another place for a while. So, you mean, Uehara went around looking for you? Yeah, I think so. Don't you think you should see him and talk about it? You can't keep avoiding him like this, you know. There's an opening in the girls' dorm. Really? They said I can move in next month. So you'd move out of your place? I still haven't given an answer to the dorm. But we already decided that we'd only live together until there was an opening at the dorm. Besides, I can't keep it secret from my parents forever. Is that what you want? I don't know anymore. He told me that he likes me, but I don't know if it's true. What? It makes me think sometimes... what if it hadn't been me that was living with him? It was just chance that I was close to Uehara. But if I hadn't been, then he probably wouldn't have even noticed me. Then... I never would have had to go through falling in love with Uehara. Nao. And I never would have had to feel this way. There's no point in talking like that now. You've met, and that's that. Listen to me. Chance and fate and all that stuff, that's what love is made of. All of it. You could go on forever talking about "what-ifs." Has it really been nothing but heartbreak? You were happy, Nao. You were happy when you fell in love with Uehara. I don't want you to regret falling in love with Uehara. OK. So, you need to tell Uehara everything you're thinking about. Even if you do move into the dorm, it's no good trying to run away from this. OK. Oh! Answer it! Answer it! It might be Uehara. DAICHI Oh, it's Daichi. Hello? Sorry about calling you so late. It's OK. What's wrong? You know, Nao, I still like you. If it were me, I'd never make you cry. I'd never play with your feelings either. You know what I thought about when I saw you crying the other day? I thought, "I want to be with Nao." No, that's not it. I want you to be with me. When I enter university, I'm thinking about living on my own. Really? You're not going to commute from home? I changed my mind. Nao, will you live with me? I want to live with you, Nao. Daichi... Nao. I want you to think it over carefully again. Daichi... I... I think I might be moving out of there. Really? There's an opening at the girls' dorm. They said I can move in next month. -Then-- -But... I'm sorry. I... I still like Uehara. With all my crying, I caused you a lot of trouble, Daichi. But, I really still do like Uehara. No matter who he actually likes. So... I'm sorry. My second confession of love... and I get rejected again. Daichi. Well, I knew it would happen, though. What's so great about that guy, anyway? He's so selfish. I can't tell what he's thinking at all. And he's mean, childish, eats too much and plays with my feelings all the time. But, still... he's kind in a lot of ways too. OK. Thanks always. From Nao. This is delicious. Ow, ow, ow! What's this all about? I'm supposed to be having lunch with Marina. There's nobody in there! I feel like I could die if I don't tell someone this. What? I felt like digging a hole and shouting into it. So what is it? Daichi confessed his love to Nao. -That's old news. -You know about it? -Even though it happened yesterday? -Huh? Yesterday? Daichi said to Nao, "When I graduate, let's live together." Seriously? And what did Nao say? -Hey. -Before I could hear that, I ran away. Why did you do that? Her answer's the important part! If Nao chose Daichi, what would happen to Uehara? Uehara would be getting what he deserves. He broke his Valentine's promise with Nao. -Really? -As for me, I think Daichi is a better match for Nao. But Uehara also likes Nao. I'm not so sure about that. It doesn't seem like he treats her very well. I like what I just heard. Let's go, shall we? I'm getting a really awful feeling about this. -What? Seriously? -Yes, seriously. I heard Daichi asked Nao to live with him. So it's true about Daichi and Nao having that kind of relationship. But don't you feel awful for Uehara? Yeah, the poor thing. I feel so bad for him. -Oh, dear. -Uehara was right there. Nao. Can we talk with you for a moment? OK. Is it true that you're going to live with Daichi when he graduates? How do you know about that? What are you talking about? We're not asking you, Marina-- You don't have to answer, Nao. This is so stupid. It must be true if you can't deny it. It's quite a shock. So it was true that you have that kind of relationship with Daichi. That means Uehara was just your toy, right? That poor Uehara. I would never-- -You're just sore that we found out. -That's right. Tell it to us straight! You're going to choose Daichi, right? There's nothing to say. I just... It was all my idea. Daichi. We made it. Mitsuishi, you went and got him? I was worried it would get out of hand. My love for her is all one-sided. Don't go bullying Nao for it. But... Nao! -Uehara! -Uehara! Come with me. What do you want with her? -It's none of your business. -It's none of yours either. You broke up, didn't-- We didn't break up! Let's go. That was on purpose, wasn't it, Daichi? Huh? You got Uehara worked up on purpose, right? I'm not as unselfish as that. You know, they really are a troublesome pair. You want to go out with us? We'll go to karaoke or bowling, or anything you like. -Abe will pay for everything. -Huh? He's the one who eavesdropped on you confessing your love. -Hey! -No, I wasn't. I just happened to be there. OK, let's go bowling after karaoke! We'll do it all! -Are you serious? -Abe's paying. Where did you stay last night? At Marina's place. You mean, you were worried about me? No. I didn't think so. It's got nothing to do with you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I didn't keep my promise. There's nothing between Yuri and me. She was drunk and was staggering down the street in a terrible state. I couldn't help but look after her. She came here only because she thought you were here. She and my brother had a good talk and settled things. She was drunk. Totally smashed... and threw up. Did she kiss you? Is that what you're worried about? -I can't help it. -Don't be stupid. That's no answer! -Where are you going? -I'm thirsty. What's this? Isn't that what you said? You'd only want this in return. MILK PUDDING The cake... was delicious. But it was crushed. It still tastes the same. This isn't the kind of thing you're supposed to give as a present. There are... way too many. Stay right here. Don't go anywhere. Uehara. I like you. I really like-- I know. OK. To all graduates and parents, I want to express my heartfelt congratulations. -Congratulations! -Congratulations! Take a picture with me! -Congratulations, Daichi! -Congratulations, Daichi! -Picture, please. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Here, here. Daichi! -Sorry. I have to go. -Daichi... -Sorry. Excuse me. Congratulations on graduating. Thank you. Nao. When you've got tests, start studying ahead of time. OK. And eat properly. OK. And don't be late. I know. And don't cry anymore. You know, I won't be around if you do. OK. Daichi. Thank you. Didn't I just tell you not to cry? I can't help it. Look who's here. Nao! Daichi, thanks for all you've done. Thank you. -You can leave Nao in my hands. -What are you talking about? Well, you can leave Marina in my hands. -You got it. -Oh, Mitsuishi! I can't believe Daichi's graduating. It was eight years. My one-sided love for Nao was that long. What are you laughing about? No... it's nothing. I totally thought forgetting was impossible. But I was able to forget after meeting her. I was able to forget about someone I loved for eight years. Are you encouraging me? Sorry if I sounded righteous. That kind of pissed me off. Uehara. Let's go. OK. Dang, I'm hungry. Hey! Huh? Ow! What do you want to eat today? Hey, quit walking away! -Come to think of it... -Huh? -What happened with that? -With what? The girls' dorm. Oh, about that, I missed my chance to take it, so they got another person. -Really? -But that's all right. You told me that you didn't want me to go anywhere. What? -You said that, right? -No, I didn't. Yes, you did! "Stay right here." -You're getting carried away. -Are you glad? Are you? Not really. You can't be honest, can you? What do you want for dinner tonight? -Meat. -What? Meat again? -OK, braised beef and potato is fine. -But that's meat too! Shabu-shabu would be nice. And that's meat as well. Dad! Mom! THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
