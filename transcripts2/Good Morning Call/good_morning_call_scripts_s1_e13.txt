 I'm Kitaura Nozomi. So, what did you want to talk to me about? Is it true... that you're dating Uehara Hisashi? Huh? It's a simple question. Just say yes if it's true, or no if it's not. Which is it? I can hardly see a thing from here. Me... and Uehara... are dating.

 I see. Then I just might cause you some trouble. You see... Uehara Hisashi is the one person I will never forgive. That diabolical man deprived me of my happiness. Uh-oh! Hey! How are you? Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. OK, bye. Oh my god. I could fall in love with her. Nao. Marina. You OK? Hey, you!

 You still remember me, don't you? Who are you? Even from a woman's perspective, that girl is pretty fascinating. Oh! I'd better add her to my list. -You're so unfaithful to me. -Huh? All that stuff about not forgiving him and having her happiness snatched away... then something must have happened between them. Nao, has he ever said anything about her? No, I guess he hasn't. Well, you know how Uehara never talks about himself. Yeah! That's right! He doesn't! Besides, he's not the type to do anything mean to anyone. It's probably just a simple misunderstanding. Really? Well, I am his girlfriend, after all. So, I really ought to trust my boyfriend. You've really matured, Nao. I want us to be more like you and Mitsuishi. What do you mean by that? Usually you two argue. But, like when you were on the Ferris wheel and the two of you are alone... You know what I mean? You saw that? -Of course I saw. -Really? I saw it too. -Ow! -Why were you looking? From appearances, you don't seem to get along. But actually, you've got a close relationship with each other. We don't seem to get along? I'm not sure I like the sound of that. Anyway, you two will become like that in no time. I mean, think of all the ordeals you've gone through together. Yeah, I guess so. I do have to admit that we've become more settled and comfortable as a couple. That Kitaura, the transfer student, she's got such a great figure and is totally cool. She and Uehara were arguing, so do you think they used to be a couple? Could be! I mean, they're both so calm and cool. Uh, Nao, I don't think you should let that kind of talk get to you. It isn't! It doesn't bother me at all! Not in the least! Oh, let's get studying, everyone! Come on everyone! Let's study. I love studying! Oh, dear! I've just got to study! -It's upside-down. -She's totally losing it. Really? You don't know a thing about Kitaura? I told you, I don't know her. Did something happen between you two, but you totally forgot about it? No, I guess you're right. Nothing happened. She just came up to me and declared war. Declared war? Yeah, like, "I'm going to crush you." I can't believe that Kitaura would pick a fight with you. -Jeez, what a pain in the ass. -Huh? I've made up my mind about her. I'm never having anything to do with her again. Oh... I see! Good! Good! What're you smiling about? Oh, uh... I'm not smiling about anything. She's quite a lot of trouble, isn't she? Yes, a lot of trouble. Nao! -Oh, Issei. -Glad I ran into you. Thanks for going out with me the other day. -It's roast pork. -What? Really? Roast pork? Enjoy it together. See you. Thank you. Wow, this is really nice. -Let's make fried rice with it. -No, way. -We're making pork roast steaks. -No! Fried rice! What're you talking about? Pork roast steaks! -I say fried rice! -And I say pork roast steaks! OK, back to work. Back to work! Just slice it up into steaks. You've never even cut one of these! Yes, I have. We're having pork roast steaks. Just look how good it is! -I'm telling you, fried rice! -No! Pork roast steaks! A FEW DAYS LATER UEHARA VS. KITAURA BRAVO! EXCELLENT! YEA! YEA! YOU'RE A REAL PAIN! I WILL CRUSH YOU. Kitaura and Uehara were at it again today. Those two should become a couple. -Yeah! They're a perfect match. -Oh, no! Yeah! Uehara and Kitaura are such a great match. I totally see it! It's like he lets her do that to him. -Oh, totally! -I told you! Oh, dear! What is it? Oh... uh... well... I was just wondering how you and that Kitaura are getting along lately. Oh... I was just kidding. Sorry! Sorry about that. Good night. Oh! That's right. Tomorrow's Saturday. I'm off work. What about you? I'm working. Figures... Oh, of course. He and Kitaura are enemies, after all. It's all right, I think. Not even! You're so naive, Nao! You have no idea what love can do! As usual, you sure are frank about your thoughts, Marina. Love that has it's seeds in hate is the kind that becomes the strongest. Just like someone you and I both know. Huh? Oh, yeah. Uehara. You said you wanted a computer, right? Yes. This new customer here says she's getting rid of her old one-- Please introduce me to her! Oh, sure. She always comes when you're not here, so I'll get her-- -Welcome! -Welco... What perfect timing! We were just talking about you, Kitaura. You mean... Try to remember. You yourself, Nao, what did you think of Uehara at first? He was stuck up... and cruel, and ticked me off. And what do you think now? I think he's super nice and kind. I'm... in love with him. See! Oh, no! Attraction is way greater when you go from hating a guy to seeing how great he is than when he's a nice guy from the start. You mean, that's likely to happen between Uehara and Kitaura? From my perspective, it's totally going to happen between them. She's the one with the computer-- -Forget it! -That was fast! I'm never going to let this guy have it. -Sorry. -Oh, I see. You're just going to throw it away, right? Then give it to me. I'll buy it! It's a Pro Graphics High Spec Processor model. -What would an amateur do with-- -Are you kidding me? Is that the rumored limited edition model? Yeah... it is. Oh, god! No! -That's horrible! -I told you. And they seem so much alike. What if they both have the same interests and suddenly hit it off? If they hit it off? It'll be too late. -Oh, no. -Nao! I used to absolutely hate your guts. But now... Me too. I wanted to crush you. But now... Who's that? She's the person who does all the housework around here. You're amazing, Kitaura. I learned a lot. I'm nothing special at all. So, if you play a game with SXGA running -it reduces performance? -That's right! That's what I couldn't under... Huh? What are they doing together? And it looks like they're hitting it off! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I think the CXKP... What are you doing there? What a coincidence. Yes, a real coincidence. The stuff he does is real hit or miss. Yeah, you're right. But when he works with Woodman-- -It works! -It sure does! The power and pace are totally different. Yeah, that's so true. Isn't it? Are you going to see him this summer? Of course. You are too, aren't you? Yeah. There's quite a lineup this summer. I want to see that match too. -It's a movie. -Huh? A movie. Oh, I was confused, I guess. If it's that amazing, then I'd like to see it with you. Movies are meant to be watched alone. -You can't focus with someone next to you. -Totally. It's especially impossible if it's someone you know. And those people who eat popcorn all through the movie. Yeah! It's like, why'd they come to the movie if they're going to do that? And there're the type that always spills stuff too. -Oh, no! -What's wrong with you? Fighting with your boyfriend again? -Can I ask you something, Issei? -Yeah. Do you know the names of foreign movie directors? No idea. Do you eat popcorn in the movie theater? Of course I do! Popcorn and a giant soda are essential! I couldn't agree more! I didn't realize Issei and I had so much in common. Huh? Aren't you working today? I'm off. What about you? -I'm working. -Oh. See you later. We only see each other in passing. Uhm, can I ask you about Kitaura? Yeah? You two came to terms, didn't you? Yeah, I guess so. It's not like we were fighting anyway. She's a pretty nice person. I see. Well, that's good. OK, see you later. You'll get run over if you keep looking down like that. Oh, Issei. Good morning. Morning. I don't share any of the same interests at all with Uehara. Yeah, you're right. You sure are frank, aren't you, Issei? There's no point in lying about it. Jeez... I guess I'm going to have to study up on movie directors and stuff. But I get sleepy when I watch complex movies. And the stuff Uehara's into is niche. What's the big problem with that? -Huh? -You know the saying. "If you're always together, you grow more and more alike." It happens to lovers and married couples. Married couples? Don't overreact to some particular words. Well, anyway... When you're with someone for a long time your looks and character, and the pace that you do things, will all become more and more alike. Don't let what's happening right now bother you so much. You've already got what's most important. I do? You're more honest and faithful to him than anyone else. Yeah. If you've got that, you don't need anything else. Just be who you are, Nao. Thank you, Issei. Besides, fate smiles on those that work hard, right? And even when things aren't working out well... you know... you can come talk to me. I'll listen to your troubles... She's not even listening to me. OK. Oh, sorry about that, Issei. Huh? What is it? That's another thing that makes you unique. Thank you. Thanks for waiting for me. No big deal. I was free anyway. Oh, about your computer... I haven't given you my OK on that! -Forget about it, anyway. -What? I think it's something that I should buy myself. -Don't you ever wonder about it? -About what? -About why I'm fighting with you. -Oh, that. -You've completely forgotten, haven't you? -Yeah. You're a nicer guy than I thought you were. YOIASA SHOPPING STREET LOTTERY I never thought you'd be interested in this kind of thing. I want fifth prize. Fifth prize? FIFTH PRIZE ONE MONTH SUPPLY OF MILK PUDDING I know somebody who loves that stuff like crazy. Nao! Yes? Here. Huh? What's this? I won it at the lottery. But I can't close the shop to go. COMPLIMENTARY TICKETS "Ikaho hot spring"? Think of it as my way of saying thanks for the hard work you do every day. What? Really? I can have this? Thank you so much! Fate is finally smiling on me! You win first prize! Congratulations. "A pair of tickets for Ikaho hot spring." You should go with your girlfriend. You can have it. -What? -Take it before I change my mind. Here. See you later. You win the milk pudding! Congratulations! Ta-da! I bet you're surprised. Yeah, way more than you can imagine. Let's go during the next three-day weekend. With whom? What do you mean "whom"? There's only you. -Just the two of us? -Uh-huh. Oh... I see. I'm looking forward to it. This really must be my reward for my hard work every day. Don't forget to get the day off from your work. Yeah. OK, I'm going to bed. Don't get yourself injured before we go on this trip. Give me a break. Oh, this looks nice. She has no idea what she's saying. I'm sure of it. I'm going to bed. I feel stupid worrying over it. Oh! This place looks nice. I'd love to go there with Uehara. Oh! Konnyaku balls. GUNMA, IKAHO What's that? Are you going on a trip? Uh-huh. With Uehara. Really? Don't tell me you're staying overnight. Uh-huh. What? What? Oh, Look at this. These konnyaku balls look delicious. You've got to be kidding me! You never told me about that, Nao! What? What? Ow! That hurts! What's wrong all of a sudden? Why didn't you tell me that you two had that kind of relationship? I feel so stupid that I avoided the subject all this time. What's wrong with you? What kind of relationship are you talking about? -What? Are you serious? -Yes. OK, that's it! Get over here! -Right now! -Jeez! What? What do you mean "what"? That's what I want to say! Wait! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! But, we aren't like that at all! What's going on? What's up with you? What did you do this time, Nao? -It's nothing! -It's nothing! Of course that's what it seems like. I mean, you're staying overnight, right? Yeah, I guess you're right. I was so excited about taking a trip with him... That you didn't think about that. How poor Uehara is! What should I do? There's nothing you can do. You may as well get on with it now that you've come this far. What? Oh, no! No way! Jeez! That's disgusting! And cold! Oh! I'm sorry! What's wrong with you? Ouch! You're the one who won't be able to go on the trip. I'm just fine! Ow! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh! I know! That's it! That's what I can do! That's what I'll do! Yea! Uehara! What are you going to wear tomorrow? It's still cold up in the mountains. What? It's my first time to go to a hot spring resort. I'm looking forward to it. Well, Nao, she, uh... she said that it would be more fun if we all went together. Really? Please! Come with us, Marina! It says up to six people is OK. Invite Mitsuishi too! But it would be unfair to Uehara. You and Mitsuishi can go to a hot spring resort for free! Huh? Well, you know, when we get there, we'll split up and go around just as couples. -Yeah, that's right. -Yeah! -That's what we'll do! -Oh! There you all are! Let's decide who's in charge of what on the trip. I'll take care of snacks. -You're going too? -Naturally! -I'd like to punch your lights out. -Huh? Never mind. I'm... home. There's something you need to tell me, isn't there? Oh... You mean, about tomorrow? Since when did this become a group tour? Well, you see... The voucher... Issei's dad gave it to me. It said that it was good for up to six people. What? Don't tell me the ramen shop owner is coming too. No, he has to run the shop. So Issei is coming instead. Sorry. I was going to tell you. -Forget it. -Huh? I'm not going tomorrow. What? Wait a second! Why? I hate being in a big group on a trip. Invite someone else. You can't be serious. Hello? Tomorrow? Yeah, I guess so. OK. I'll be there. Good bye. What? Where are you going tomorrow? I've got work at the gas station. Another guy can't come in, so they asked me to work instead. You're so horrible. How can you suddenly cancel like that-- You've got no right to say that! If you didn't want to be alone with me, then you should have just told me. It's not like I didn't want to. It's just that the two of us alone... I mean... You see... Then just tell me that. But to decide it all on your own, and go around changing it... That means you're only thinking about yourself. Uhm, Uehara. Sorry, but I've got to get to work. -Where's Issei? -He went to look for them. They aren't upstairs. What are those two doing? They're so late. -Maybe because it's cloudy. -What's that got to do with it? -It does, a little. -You think so? -Maybe not. -They're not that kind. Nao! -Huh? -There she is! What are you doing over there, Nao? Huh? Where's Uehara? Oh, dear. Well, I can pretty much figure out what happened between you. But what's happened has happened. That's right! That's right! Uehara's never going to come if you just sit there. Yeah, you're right. Cheer up, and let's go! Ikaho! Ikaho! Ikaho! -This way? -No, that way! That way? Really? Must be rough having a fight when they live together. What? Nao and her boyfriend live together? Huh? You didn't know about that? No. Mitsuishi! Mitsuishi! Here! FOR IKAHO HOT SPRING -You want one, Nao? -No, I'm OK. Can't she even clean up after herself? We're going here together for sure! -You want one, Issei? -Yeah. -Wow! It's so beautiful! -Wow! Dang, it's cold! Oh! Hey, Nao! Let me see that travel guide. OK. I wasn't thinking when I left home. What? Are you serious? Oh, no! Marina! There's an information booth. Oh! An information booth! -Oh, Abe! -Huh? We can walk while eating. I'll try for an indirect kiss! A relaxing foot bath. We can snuggle! I'll buy the good luck charm for couples! Free refills! We've got to go! Can I take it home? We'll really get in the mood here. Must check it out! We'll take a photo together here! Uehara will love this! I want to go here together! We surely got to be alone here! You want my konnyaku balls? Yeah! It's delicious! Uehara? Are you going somewhere too? Uh, yeah. What about you? Yeah. With that prize you gave me. I thought I'd go have a good time. Oh... That... I'll take a photo for you. OK! Ikaho! OK. Got it. -How do I see it? -Is the picture good? Nao. -How do you see it? -Don't you know? I'm her servant. OK, got it. That hurts my knees. -You're next, Nao. -Me? -I don't need one. -Get over there! -Smile! -Smile! OK. Come on, smile! Here we go! Thank you! Hey! Wait for me! IKAHO HOT SPRING OK. KAORI RAMEN Sorry. I recommended this place, but if you don't like it... No! It's delicious! Really, it is! Oh, I forgot to add pepper. It needs pepper. Hey! Stop! That's too much! It won't taste any good. Nao's forcing herself to have a good time. She's totally missing Uehara. Oh, well. I guess I'd better help her out. I'll send this to Uehara. Uehara couldn't resist this. It'll break his heart to see Nao looking like this. -She's smiling, but... -Her eyes are crying. Wait a minute. You know Uehara's number? Of course! We're best friends. -Go for it, Abe! -Got it! But Uehara never replies very fast. Don't expect an answer soon. I'm still eating. Don't force yourself to eat it, Nao. No, I'm not forcing myself. Like they say, powerful food is good for the heart and-- Nao! What is it? Uehara is on his way here! -Aren't you coming, Uehara? -I'll be there by this evening. He is? Yep. I... I'll go and wait for him! Oh! Whoa! OK. Sorry. Let me get out of the way. -Be careful. -OK. That's the best smile she's had all day. It's so easy to tell what she's thinking. What time will Uehara get here? -Uh... -I don't know. Really? Nao could be waiting there forever. Nothing wrong with that. It's pretty fun waiting for someone you love. You say some pretty great things sometimes. Hey, Nao. Oh! Uehara! You've been waiting a while, haven't you? You must be cold. Here. Put on my coat. No, it's all right, Uehara. No, I want you to wear it. Thank you, Uehara. You're so kind. But really, you don't have to. Score! No, really! It's OK! Hey, you! You've been waiting for a while. Aren't you cold? Oh. I'm fine. When I move around like this, I can stay warm. OK. But don't catch a cold. Here you go. It's fresh cooked, and warm. Really? Are you sure? Thank you so much! Is that Nao? Yeah. I guess you like girls that are a little weird. Oh! Uehara! -Everybody's looking at you. -Really? I guess I went a little overboard. Jeez! What? Well... I was just glad that you came. Yeah, well, my job ended pretty early. I see. That's great. Thank you. You totally look like a Daruma doll. -How can you say that? -Let's go. Really? But where? If we don't hurry, we'll never be able to see all of these. Yeah! What's wrong? Oh, it's nothing. Where to first? I'm not so tactless as to interfere with you two. Wow! Those two sure seem to be getting along well! Yeah. -I envy them. -Yeah. Leave them be. Let's go! -OK, fine. -OK. What are you doing here? Why are you here, Kitaura? -Are you on a trip too? -Yeah. -Are you alone? -Yes. Where are you going next? First to Ikaho shrine, then to Kajika bridge. That's exactly where I was going to go! IKAHO HOT SPRING 315 STONE STEPS FROM HERE Oh! TRAGIC LOVERS HILL "It became known to help in achieving a successful romance." We've got to go here! Right? Hey! "However, you must be very careful if you already have a lover." "Since these two in the legend could not consummate their love," "there are tales of them becoming jealous" "and putting a curse any couples that get along too well." Do you want a sweet bun, Uehara? -A sweet bun? -Here. Where did you get that from? This lady gave it to me. I've been keeping it warm. -Thanks. -Sure. -The filling is coming out. -Really? Quit complaining! Here! Eat it! -I'll eat it myself. -No, you can't have it. -Give it here. -Give it back! I'll eat it. -Hey! -Yum! That's good! Fine! I've got another one anyway. THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
