 Yuri. Who the hell do you think I am? Oh my God, he kissed me. Me and Uehara... Oh, no... Hang on, he thought I was someone else. That's it, it's just a mistake. There's nothing to worry about. No, who am I kidding? It totally worries me.

 What should I do? My very first kiss... Because you kicked me, my stomach turned red. Hey, stay away from me! Hey, what's the matter? You're the one who did it, you know. What are you talking about? What? Don't you remember? Remember what? If my alarm's going off, wake me up normally. -What do you mean normally? -Are you daft? Wake me up gently, OK?

 There's no way I can do that? Hey, you. What? Don't tell me, after all this time, you're concerned about living with a boy? Are you fantasizing about me making a move on you? Don't worry. I have absolutely no interest in you. Put my bag back the way it was, and like I said before, don't talk to me at school. Now I'm ticked off. Darn him! Three meters. Huh? Where did Uehara go? Wait! Where am I? Damn, she's so stupid. -Good morning. -Hi. Is Nao having the day off today? I haven't heard anything. Where is she? Today is my big chance to see Uehara. So, that's today, huh? Yep! What a load of crap. I got a message from Nao. What does it say? She says "I am lost." What? Where am I? I'm going to be late. Oh no, it's a dead end. Help! No! Help me! I made it. I had a messed up first kiss from someone who told me he's not interested in me, and I got chased by a dog! This is all, completely, entirely, Uehara's fault! Hey! Be quiet in here! -Yes, Sir! -You are late. Yes. I'm so sorry, please excuse me. Aren't you going to eat, Nao? I think she's run out of energy for today. You followed unknown roads, moreover, you have no sense of direction! It's not my fault, it's... Don't tell anyone we live together. Well... Actually it's all my fault. Hey, keep your chin up. After this, we have sports with A class! Joint sports class... Hey, come on, you two. Perk up! We can see Uehara who looks so cool! I've seen enough. No thanks. I'm full. Come on, Nao, what are you talking about? -Get out of the way! -Hey! What the... -Nao, let's go! -Huh? Why? -Quickly now! -Wait a sec, Marina! Look at that. It's like a fantasy world. He's so sharp and cool. But sometimes, he looks so lonely. The shop's sold out of curry bread. Really? Did you see that? He's just bummed about the curry-- It must be because he suffered while growing up. He is the perfect guy for me. You know Uehara lost his parents when he was a kid, right? I'm no freeloader you know. So, in conclusion, no matter how many times I see him, he is the perfect man for me! Uehara! Well, I don't like him. -What? -Oh, nothing, don't worry. Don't you think he has a girlfriend? Really? Who told you that? Huh? Yuri. No, what I meant was that he must have at least one girlfriend. I haven't heard that rumor yet, but I would be so shocked if he has one. I don't get to see cool guys like him so often, you know? I don't know why he's so popular. He is one of the top three. The rules are so tough too. Rules? You heard them the other day. -Remember? -I remember but... The unspoken rules among girls. Sit. There are three groups interested in Uehara at the moment. First are the teachers' favorites, the super smart girls. Next are the really naughty ones, the outlaw girls. And the ones that are popular with the guys, the manager girls. These three groups decided to manage all interactions with Uehara. Uehara is for everyone. If you talk with him or meet with him, it can cause big trouble! He's like a goddamn national treasure. Yes, national treasure! No touching! Hey, shouldn't you be getting ready? Next lesson is your favorite, right? You're right! Oh, no! I kissed the national treasure! So, Marina, which group are you in? I'm just one of the majority. I just hope that Uehara will approach me on his own. Yeah, right. Nice imagination! Mitsuishi! UEHARA -What's up? -What? It's nothing. Nothing at all. I got to go to the toilet. I have a sore tummy. -Nao? -Nao? If I get found out... I'm screwed! Hey Uehara, help us out next lesson. We don't want to lose to class D. No, I'm going to sleep in the infirmary. Do you know her? She's looking right at you. Nope, no idea. She's dancing! Maybe she ate something wrong! You! Hey! I told you to stay away from me! It's an emergency. Read this! What? Hey, stop it! Thanks to her, I couldn't play hooky. YOSHIKAWA Where did she go? Hey! Wait! You've got the wrong sports clothes, Uehara. There's no one in the home economics room, so let's swap there. It's not me, it's your mistake! UEHARA Hey, wait! Stop it! UEHARA What the hell? Why did you cut it? Because you wouldn't listen to me. Fix it! What? I'll give you five minutes. That's impossible! It's just a small hole. It's like wearing a pants with holes in the knees, see? This is not the knee, you idiot! There's no shirts with a hole here! You always get pissed off. What the... Fine, I'll fix it. You are such a pain. If only you had listened to me... No, this is your fault, and who the hell cuts shirts like this? Can't help it now though. No one cuts it like this though. Shut up. Which needle do I use? Who cares! Use any of them. I found it. Not yet? Don't rush me, OK? Hurry up. You are a girl, right? Hey, that's a stereotype! You were going to sleep in the infirmary anyway. That has nothing to do with it. What a pain in the ass. What did you say? No, nothing. Ouch! Oh, are you OK? What the hell? It's no big deal. Hey, come on, what would you do if a girl got a scar on her hand? A girl? If you're a girl, fix this! Shut up, I'm doing it now. -You are taking forever. -Help me then. Strike three! Batter out! -Do your best! -You can do it! Strike! Batter out! -Uehara, you're so cool! -You're awesome! Don't worry about it, Mitsuichi. It's only you coming for me, Nao. -Don't say that, it's not true. -Yes, it is. -Nao! -Hi, Daichi. -Do you have sports class too, Daichi? -Yeah. Hey, you are holding the bat wrong. Daichi, can you teach me? I want to hit him for a home run! -At any cost... -Wow, that's not like you, Nao. You're all feisty. I don't like him. -Just because he's cool, -You're right. good at sports and doing well in school, -he thinks he can get away with anything. -That's right. The world doesn't revolve around you! Yeah! Not you! -Hit it! -I will. -Nao, you will hit a home run! -Yep, I will! First, this is how you hold the bat. OK! -OK. -Left hand at the bottom, -keep your arms in tight. -OK. -See? -Yeah. Don't try to hit it with your bat, use your whole body. Like a spring, unwind and hit! Strike! Three Strikes! Batter Out! Game Over! What? That's it? Uehara could have gone a bit easy on me. Huh? Where is my uniform? Yoshikawa. This was on the hallway floor. Is it yours? What? Did you drop your uniform, Nao? Perhaps... Thank you. Hey, what's wrong with you? Maybe this is all part of Yoshikawa's charm? I'm so jealous of her feminine charms. Looks like Uehara is interested in you as well. What? Really? No, not at all. -Bye then. -See you around. Milk pudding or milk jelly... It's so hard to choose between them. It's such a tough choice. I love the richness of pudding, but I also love the smoothness of jelly. Which do you like better, Marina? -What are you hiding? -What? Whenever you hide things, you talk a whole bunch of crap, over and over. Really? I didn't mean to babble. Wait, Marina! Marina, wait! Now, Marina... What the hell? You're living with a boy like this? It will take a bit to explain, but... You were hiding it from me too? Sorry. That's the whole story. So we're not living together nor dating. I'm just waiting until a space is available in the girls dorm. So, who is it? What? The guy you are living with? Well, it's... Older, same age? Which one? About the same, I think. What? Same school? Do I know him? What? Daichi? Not him, no. No, not him. So, better than him? Worse? Definitely worse... I mean Daichi is one of the top three. Well... I'm not sure. What? Socially, he's actually above Daichi. Which means that... It's Uehara! Welcome home. I thought you have part time job today. I finished early. Oh, I see. This is my best friend, Marina. Of all days, why today... Go. Darn it all! Sorry that I kept it a secret. Nao! Yes? This is amazing! Sit down, sit down. This is so amazing. You can get close to the incredible Uehara. If I come to your house, I can meet him anytime, right? Well, I guess yes, but he is usually at work, not home. So, Nao, how do you feel about him? About what? You don't feel anything for Uehara? Nothing actually. Really? Nothing at all. If that's the case, can you help me? Please! Set me up with him! I guess I can try, but Uehara is not the guy you think he is. You're not even listening. Oh, what? Yay! Yay! -See you then. -OK, see you tomorrow. I don't understand why she likes him so much. Crap, you scared me! He didn't hear me, did he? Hey! What are you thinking? What do you mean? Living together. If we get found out, we'll be expelled! I know-- No, you don't, that's why you brought her! Listen to me-- Keep her quiet, OK? Marina's not like that. -How do you know? -I just know. She's been my friend since junior high. Friend... What do you mean? I can't trust her. What? Your friends are just like you. Totally absent minded. Hey, you! Marina is totally different from me. She's serious and strong. You don't have to worry about her! You don't even know Marina, but you say you don't trust her. That's not fair. Marina is a friend I trust the most! What a complete jerk! I hate you! MEGUROGAOKA HIGH SCHOOL What the fuck? Stay away from Uehara Hisashi. Where are you going? The toilet. Yoshikawa, what are you doing? I'm so sorry. Nao, are you OK? Yeah. Really? What? Something's up this morning. You're not yourself. Oh! Did something happen with Uehara? No, that's not it. I'm just a bit hungry. That's all. -Really? -Yes, really. When you are not smiling, it really upsets me, you know. Thanks, Marina. No problem. Oh, dear... Yoshikawa, someone's calling for you. Who? Uehara. He's waiting in the PE hall. Really? Thanks. Maybe she's really popular? -Well... -Huh? Why would he call for me at school? What did I do wrong this time? Uehara? Where is he? What? Sorry, we tricked you. There's no escape, you know. So, what is it between you and Uehara? What? Stop pretending, spit it out! Don't pretend that you don't know the rules about Uehara Hisashi. Stay away from Uehara Hisashi. Hey, why are you here, Uehara? What? Uehara is for everyone, OK? You got it? And you're not really good enough to fit in with us though. She's right. I'm amazed you have the guts to meet Uehara with that face and body. Even though he is so cool and perfect, he has a big scar on his heart. -That is Uehara. -Poor Uehara. But we all are always by his side. We're kindly watching over him. That is our reason for living. -That's right. -Yep, she's right. He absolutely needs us. You're so right. I don't think he needs that. -Huh? -Huh? He's not poor Uehara, you know. He doesn't need you. Huh? What are you saying? -Uehara lost his parents-- -I know! I know that, but when someone is doing his best, you should say, well done, not poor you, right? Your rules are so stupid. -Huh? -Huh? You keep saying you know him because of his looks and this and that, but if you really want to get to know someone, You should talk, laugh and fight with him. Without doing that, how could you know? For those who don't even know that, Uehara won't even express the slightest interest! Oh, dear, I said it all. Right, now you've pissed me off. Who the fuck are you? Fuck off. -Uehara? -Uehara? You, you are just so stupid. What? She is my girlfriend. Huh? When you have a problem, tell me. -No way... -You're lying. Uehara? Let's go. Hey... What? Why are you doing this? Me and you-- Be quiet. Just walk, OK? OK. Oh my God! Nao? Huh? No one's looking now, right? What? I thought it over again. I realized pretending to be strangers was impossible. If we pretend to go out, I have a reason to go to your house, right? So, what you're saying is... Let's pretend to be going out. Pretend? Oh, sorry, did I get your hopes up? No, not really. OK, so you want to really go out then? Got you! Well, I've got to go to work. Bye. Uehara, thank you for saving me. I'm sorry. Huh? About yesterday. About your friend. Oh, that... yeah. Go back quickly or you'll catch a cold! Okay. Uehara? Uehara! Hey, are you OK? Hey, Uehara... MEGUROGAOKA SAKURA HOSPITAL Don't worry, he's just tired from work and not enough sleep. Maybe he was just a bit undernourished. If he eats properly, and rests for a few days, he'll be fine. Thank you so much. I've gotten in touch with his family too. Take care. Uehara? Oh. "Oh?" I was really worried about you. It's because you sleep on the couch. You're exaggerating, it's nothing. Nothing? Right, let's go home. What? Hey, take it easy. I'll be fine if I eat something yummy. What? Yuri. Yuri? So she's Uehara's girlfriend? THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
