 I like Uehara. Oh! -Uhm... -How's your fever? -It's OK now. -Oh, I see. Did he hear me? Or didn't he? Which is it? -Argh! -What? Did you say something? No... Nothing at all. He heard. He didn't hear.

 He heard. He didn't hear. Yes! Oh. Yours is in the fridge. Oh, thank you. By the way, you didn't happen to hear what I said in the park just now, did you? No. Thank goodness. I did hear you say that you liked me, or something like that. What? Oh no! -You're faking it, right? -Huh?

 Don't worry. I know you're not serious. Yeah, that's right. He would never give up unless you said that, right? Yes, yes. That's right. I heard he's called the king of the love confession. He falls in love with anyone and tells them he loves them. -I'm happy for you. -Huh? It's nice that there's someone that thinks you're attractive. What? What're you so angry about? I was complimenting you. That's no compliment! It's not funny. Huh? I'm not laughing at you. That Uehara can sure be stupid. Well, I guess I'm glad about it. But it kind of ticks me off that he doesn't think anything of me. Nao, you actually like Uehara, don't you? I can tell. There's no need to hide it. I'm not trying to hide it. I realized it myself recently. Finally, you accepted it. Like I figured. I was in love with Uehara too. So I know it was hard to tell me. -Sorry. -Now, you listen to me. You're more important to me than Uehara is. Keeping it secret from me really made me sad. Oh, Marina. I'm so happy that I finally get to talk about love life with you. You look happy. What're you doing for New Year's? I'm planning to go to my parent's. You're going back too, right? No. My brother and Yuri are going to be in Hawaii on New Year's. -Hawaii? -They said it's their honeymoon. I see. -Then that means you're... -Working. Hourly wages go up during New Year's. I'll probably get a New Year's bonus too. -You're spending New Year's Eve here? -I'll just come home and go to bed. Oh, I see. Make sure you do your New Year's cleaning before you go home. I will. It's just so expensive to travel home during New Year's. And I used way too much money to move in here. Plus I've got remedial lessons. But, at least you can come home for New Year's Day and after. But, you see, they asked me to work then. And spring vacation isn't that long after winter vacation. I guess so. Besides, it won't be easy to get a plane ticket now. Plane tickets are really expensive during New Year's. Oh, all right. I'll send you some New Year's gift money. Thank you, Mom. Bye. This means... New Year's Eve with Uehara. Happy New Year. I wish you all the best this year. Me too. This is going to be so nice. What? We're closed on New Year's? On New Year's Eve, most people eat soba. It's the only time ramen shops can take a nice break. Every year we're open till the 30th and start again on the third. -No work, huh? -You're going home, aren't you? Huh? Oh, yes. -Welcome! -Welcome! Oh! -Daichi, what brings you here? -I'm hungry. Actually, I'm a fan of this ramen now. -Thanks for revisiting! -Thanks for revisiting! -Here you go. -Looks great. Thanks. By the way, Nao-- Welcome! -Abe. -What are you doing here, Nao? Well, I work here. -Now I see. -Huh? I was talking to Mitsuishi. He said since I was feeling down about being turned down by you that I should come here. He said I'd get over it for sure. What was he thinking? What's so funny? I think I'm getting over it now. That's not funny. He's a friend of yours, Nao? Oh! Your boyfriend? I hope to be. But she's turned me down. Abe, don't talk about that. Wow. You're unexpectedly popular. What do you mean, "unexpectedly"? -Here you go. -Thank you. -Nao. -Yes? Before the end of the year, I'll get over the girls I've loved this year. And I'll start looking for new love in the new year. Good. I think you need to be a little more careful next year. You know that's why they call you the king of the love confession. But when I really like someone, I just don't feel right if I don't tell them. Yeah, that's right. I know how you feel. Issei, what are you talking about? I'm the type that says what I feel when I like someone. Yep. When you don't do anything, you regret it way longer than when you do. Can I call you "teacher"? Ramen, please, teacher! -One order of ramen. -Coming right up. COFFEE SHOP -You can go when you're done there. -OK. -Hi, Uehara. -Oh, hi. Hey, Uehara, when are you going to tell me your new address? I'll tell you when you catch up to my age. That's mean. I'll never catch up. Nanako. You've got studying to do. I'm not studying until I get Uehara's address. -Aw, jeez. Go ahead, you can leave. -Yes, sir. -Later. -Hey, Uehara. After work on New Year's Eve, spend the New Year's countdown with us. -Good bye. -Thanks. Bye. -Dad. -What is it? -I know you have it. -What? Uehara's new address. That's personal information, you know. THE NEXT DAY I'm so hungry. Who could that be? Yes? Come on in. -Sorry for dropping in like this. -It's OK. Where's Uehara? -I think he's working at the gas station. -Excellent. When he's around, he always pesters me to leave. -I bought us some donuts. -Really? Great! Huh? You're still in your uniform? Isn't it winter vacation now? School hasn't gone well... So I... Remedial lessons, huh? I had to take them too. -What? You? -Uh-huh. Takuya, my husband, he always got good grades, but mine were horrible. So his brains are inherited. -Here you go. -Huh? New Year's gift money? We'll be traveling, so can you give it to him on New Year's Day? Sure. The other day, I visited him at his job, but he never actually listens. Oh, one of them is for you. What? No, I can't accept-- No, no. This is a token of our appreciation. Thanks for all you do for Uehara. No, I don't do anything at all. And... Ta-da! Kagami mochi. It's gigantic. What do you think about putting it here? Wow! It's amazing! I didn't know they sold ones this big. Cool, huh? Huh? Yes? -Who are you? -Uh... May I have your name? -Where's Uehara? -He's at work now. -May I please have your name-- -What have you got to do with Uehara? We live together. What? Hey, out of my way! Wait a second! Hold it right there! -Oh, is that you, Nanako? -Oh, Yuri. What? You know each other? Who the heck are you? Who am I? I live with Uehara. My name's Nao Yoshikawa. You told me that before. But why are you living together? Well, it's the result of several things... Oh, but we're not sleeping together. We're merely living together. Damn straight! There's no way in hell Uehara would fall for a girl with such little sex appeal as you. How do you even know that? Quit staring at me. Hey! What the hell are you doing? I can't even tell your front from your back. I know Uehara would never try anything with you. -Why you-- -Let me ask you this. Has he ever tried anything with you while living together? He hasn't, has he? No... Obviously, he's not attracted to you at all. Uehara has already promised to spend the New Year countdown with me. -Really? -Hey, you. I thought I'd hear this out, but you're just making stuff up. He only treats you nicely because you're his manager's daughter. What makes you think you're so sexy? Well, you see... I'm a C cup. And you, Yuri, may look like you've got a nice rack, but those are pads in your bra! What? Is that true? To tell you the truth... How little you know. Now you listen here. Big boobs... sag with age. What... I'm still only 15. I'll work hard to keep them firm! -Fifteen? -Fifteen? You sure look old! How rude! I'm just mature-looking. You're the one who's an old woman. Hey! I'm still only-- Shut up! What the hell is all this racket? You'll disturb the neighbors.. Welcome home. Hey! Wait! Stop! Don't you dare run away! Are you nuts? What're they doing here? -How should I know? -I bet you do. -Why'd you invite her? Who is she? -I didn't invite her. Uehara! These two are teasing me. -What a liar! -She's a different person. You shouldn't get involved with uncivilized people like them. Dad said the second-floor room might become vacant next month. He'll rent it to you super cheap. -Huh? -What? -You OK? -Yeah... I'm OK... Uehara, are you going to move again? She's just making stuff up. Hey, Nanako. Get home before it gets dark. OK. Dad said the second-floor room might become vacant next month. He'll rent it to you super cheap. -Huh? -What? Is he really going to move out? He must be at work. Huh? Who could that be? Yes? Oh, Daichi. What's up? Remedial classes end today, right? I've got practice too, so I thought we could go together. -OK. -I've got something to tell you too. Is it true you're not going home for New Year's? News sure travels fast. My mom heard from your mom. Yeah, there's a lot of reasons for it. I mean, I just moved, and the cost of traveling is crazy. Plus, I've got work. Why don't you come stay at my place on New Year's Eve? -Huh? -Mom's worried about you. If you come, then we'll have New Year's soba together. Let's do our New Year's shrine visit at Hachiman too. -We went there together last year too. -Uh-huh. It doesn't really feel like a new year unless we go there. Uh-huh. I guess I'll go. Tell your mom I'll be there. Got it. OK, remedial lessons are over. -Yes! -All right! Go ahead and have lots of fun but don't forget to review over New Year's. Ah! Finally, it's over. Mitsuishi. -Join us for an end-of-class party? -Heck yeah. I'll go. You two are coming too, right? Oh... I'll go. I've got a little time before work. That'll be refreshing. Don't you agree, Marina? -I'm not going. -Really? Come here, Nao... Come with me. What? What? What is it? What is it? What's wrong? I need to talk with you about something alone. Really? Wow. I can hardly believe it. Believe what? That you're living with that stud. But... Uehara doesn't find me attractive. It's more like we just happen to live together. And who knows how long even this will last? Nao? Oh, sorry. Forget about my problems. What is it you wanted to talk about? Oh, yeah. To tell you the truth, Mitsuishi... Yes? He told me he likes me. Huh? Uh... Nao? Hey, Nao! Really? -Don't exaggerate so much. -You've got to be kidding! It surprised me too. -When did he do it? -Christmas Eve. -Then he really does love you. -You think so too? -Yes, of course! -Oh, dear. I've never thought of Mitsuishi in that way before. I mean, there's nothing wrong with him, but he's also not really handsome. But, listen to me, Marina. You have no idea how much courage it took for him to tell you that. That means he really loves you, Marina. -I understand that, but... -But what? Ah! I don't know what to tell him. Anyway, I don't dislike Mitsuishi. I think he's a nice guy. Think it over, for Mitsuishi's sake as well. I will. Nao! -I feel so much better now. -I'm so happy for you. Here you go, Nao. -Huh? -New Year's bonus. No, I can't accept that from you. It's hardly anything. Besides, this is our last day this year. Oh, Issei. Here's one for you too. Thank you very much. That's how you accept it, obediently. -Thank you very much. -You're welcome. -OK, see you next year, Nao. -Uh-huh. You two have a happy New Year. DECEMBER 30 What was this for? What are you up to? Like you said, I'm doing my New Year's cleaning. Like they say, "Clean out this year's dirt before the end of the year." Cleaning? Looks more like you're making a mess. How rude! I'm getting rid of the clutter. Getting rid of clutter? You take out all of your things then separate what you need from what you don't. You just moved in. Is that all necessary? I"m not sure if you're bright, or if you're stupid. I'm off to work. See you... Oh! -Tomorrow, I'm going to Daichi's place. -You are? My mom told Daichi's mom about me so now I'm going to stay there for New Year's Eve. I see. You must be happy. Besides, I'll be out working. Uehara has already promised to spend the New Year's countdown with me. Oh, that's right. NEW YEAR'S EVE It's cold. Guess he's already at work. Thank you. Dang, it's cold. Huh? What? The lights went out. Oh, no. Where's the fuse box? Oh, there it is. All right. I think it's this one. OK. Are they back on? Huh? How come they're not on? Manager, I'm here. Oh, Uehara. Is everything OK? -Huh? -The blackout. Isn't that where you live? Oh, I've been out since this morning. Oh, yeah. I was worried about you. They said the trains had stopped too because of the blackout. Well, I'm glad you made it. That's good. It's so cold. Oh! That's cold! Huh? Why is there water here? What? Oh, no. Oops! It's soaking wet here. It's all melted. YOSHIKAWA NAO CONNECTING Hello, Daichi? It's me. Sorry, but I don't think I can make it. I heard the trains have stopped. You want me to come get you? No, it's OK. The power is out here, so I think it's better if I don't leave home. -The power's out? -Uh-huh. But I'm sure it'll come back on again pretty soon. All right. I see. Is he there? Uehara? No. I don't think he's coming home today. I see. But I'm perfectly fine. I don't mind being home at all. OK, I see. Bye. Oh, Daichi. Have a happy New Year. Have a happy New Year too. Bye. It sure is cold. Come to think of it, the second-floor room will become vacant next month. So it's true. -Oh, did Nanako say something? -Yeah. But I didn't think it was true. Well, usually I rent it for $700. -But for you, I'll rent it for $500. -Really? But I can't pay for moving cost, though. You're paying, what, $700 to $800 now, right? Yes. In the long run, it's best to move to a cheaper place. And I'll provide meals here too. But there is that pesky one here. There has been a large scale blackout in parts of the Tokyo area. The power company says that the power lines have been damaged. However, they don't know what caused it. Without any idea when the power will be back on, there are 3,500-- Have a happy New Year! Best wishes for the New Year. Are you OK, Nao? It's going to run out of power. PLEASE CHARGE YOUR PHONE. 20% OF BATTERY REMAINING. OK, I've got to turn it off in case I need it for an emergency. SHUTTING DOWN Sorry everyone. It's so cold. I didn't know it could get so cold with the power out. I wish Uehara would come home. You may as well go home. But there might still be customers. I'll still pay you for the hours you're scheduled for. Take it easy on New Year's Eve, at least. I appreciate it. Thank you. We're closed tomorrow, New Year's Day. Don't come in by mistake. OK. Manager, thank you for all you've done this year. You have a happy New Year. I will. The number you have dialed cannot be reached because it has been switched off or-- I wish I could tell everyone, "Happy New Year." DAICHI, DAICHI, DAICHI, MOM, MOM, MARINA DAICHI, DAICHI, UEHARA, DAICHI, DAICHI Oh. UEHARA Uehara called me. Oh, please. Go through. -Hello? -Oh! Hello. Uehara? Where are you now? I heard the power's out at home. Uh-huh. It's really terrible... Huh? Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry about me. Enjoy the New Year countdown. OK, bye. Oh! Uehara. Yeah? Have a happy New Year. Have a happy New Year. Ouch! Oh, oops. Nao? You here? Yeah, I knew she wouldn't be. I'm here. What are you doing here? I couldn't help it. Weren't you staying over somewhere? The trains aren't running. And the blackout caused problems with the fridge. Then why didn't you tell me? I thought it was odd your phone cut out all of a sudden. But I thought you were spending the countdown at Nanako's. I didn't want to bother you at work. -What about you, Uehara? -What about me? From the start, I said... I told you to lean on me, right? I'm sorry. -It sure is cold. -Uh-huh. Oh, it's lit. I got this candle at my brother's wedding. It's pretty. I thought about throwing it away. Never expected it to be of use. It's nice, warm and bright. OK, I'm going to sleep here tonight. Wait, Uehara. Huh? What happened? Did I do something stupid again? But what? If we're both in the same room, that'll make it warmer. He's so close. You changed? Of course. I'm going to bed, after all. Oh, yeah. You're right. Man, it's cold. -Don't you worry. -What? I won't try anything with you. I know that. Of all people, I know best just how unattractive you think I am. Don't you worry either. At the very least, I don't even expect you to do anything like that. I know that. Are you asleep, Uehara? Yep. Uhm... Did you leave home because Yuri and your brother got married? Why are you asking that now? I mean, you work so many jobs and suffer things you don't have to, so you could leave home... I just thought it must have taken a lot of resolve to do that. Oh, I'm sorry. That's none of my business, is it? Let me ask you this. If you loved someone who didn't love you for eight years, then that person got married to someone else, could you be around them and still act normal? That's why I did it. Won't you ever see your brother again? Yes, I will. It's not like I hate him. You see... the problem is my own. However... I never plan on returning home. Good night. Good night. Oh! What? -Is it past midnight? -Way past. Happy New Year, Uehara. Best wishes in the new year. I'll try not to be too hard on you either. I'm going to sleep now. OK, me too. Ah, they came on. I'm so glad. -I wonder if the trains are running. -Why? Are you going somewhere? Uh-huh. Daichi invited me to go to a New Year's shrine visit together. Oh, you want to come too? It's the New Year, and I think it's best to do that kind of thing. You're probably right. -What? You'll come? -You don't want me to? Not at all. No, not at all. Let's go! Darn it, Uehara. Your dithering has made us late. -You've got no right to say that. -Why? -You only told me this morning. -But you said you wanted to come. You should have told me yesterday. Oh, give me a break. Daichi. Happy New Year. Best wishes in the new year. I brought Uehara along. -Hi. -Hi. Was everything OK with the blackout? Uh-huh, after Uehara came back home. Thanks. No big deal. I just came to my own place. That's right. You're acting like my parent, Daichi. I should have gone over myself. No, it's all right. Sorry for causing you to worry. That was a long prayer. I probably overdid it for one dollar. Nao. I wanted to talk to you about something the other day. Yes? Uh, I'll tell you later. OK. I want a good luck charm. You should get one for safety when traveling. Good idea. Oh, it's Mitsuishi. Oh my god! Oh, no! Uh, I wish you all the best in the new year, Nao. Marina, did you... We're... going together now. Congratulations. Thank you. This is thanks to you, Nao. Is that right? What? Why are you crying? -Seriously? -I'm just so happy. -Oh gosh, here. -Thank you. -Oh, you. Thank you so much. -Congratulations. Mitsuishi getting that Great Fortune was so perfect. Who's Mitsuishi? -What? You don't know? -No. He's been around since school started. -Huh? -Crap. Crap. Make yourselves at home. You're so mean, Uehara. Huh? We're supposed to do the New Years count down together. You decided on that by yourself. I can't stand this. Why? Why do you live with her? I've known you so much longer than her. And I love you so much more than her. Move over to our place, Uehara. The second-floor room is only $500. It'll be cheaper than this place and easier to work there, right? Your dad already told me that. Then-- I turned him down. Why? I'm still in high school and renting a new place isn't easy. I'm sure Dad will do something to make it easier-- Besides... I enjoy living here. I have no intention of moving. All right, now that you know how I feel, get home and study for entrance exams. Nao. -I'm going to make dinner. You want some? -Uhm... I know you haven't realized this, so I'm going to tell you. THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
