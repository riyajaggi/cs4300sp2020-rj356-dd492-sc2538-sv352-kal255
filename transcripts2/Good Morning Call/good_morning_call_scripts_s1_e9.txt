 You mean... he... likes me? It's true. Seriously? No way! I can hardly believe it! What? Really? Huh? No, that's not what I mean. I mean I never expected Uehara to say such a thing. Oh... Yeah. I kind of thought it was true. Huh? I thought Uehara just might like you. Huh? Really? How did you know? Isn't it wonderful? Now you can be a real boyfriend and girlfriend.

 Uh... -To tell you the truth... -Huh? I haven't told him I like him. You haven't told him you like him? Don't shout it! Why not? Huh? I mean, I was so elated... I missed my chance to say it. Then from Uehara's perspective, it's one-sided love? Wow! What an envious position you're in! But I'm sure my feelings are totally obvious. -No, I don't think he's noticed. -Really? I mean, Uehara can't read feelings at all! Well, you can't either. Well, whatever. It's almost Valentine's Day anyway. It's your chance to tell him you like him. Valentine's Day? Yep. Maybe I'll give it a shot. Nao! I'm so happy for you! Good morning. Stop! -I'm sorry. -Like I said, don't apologize. Nao? -What's wrong? -You're spacing out. It's nothing at all. I've got to study for the test. Just memorize this question! I'll do my best! OK, pass them forward quickly. If you still can't master this stuff, it'll affect you in your senior year. You'll be having entrance exams next year as well. If you couldn't do a problem, don't just leave it blank. OK, put them here after they've been collected. What's with you? Sorry. You can eat alone today. I need to talk with Marina. -OK, goodbye. -Hey! Yes? Well, it doesn't really matter, but we're going to see each other every day when we're at home, so it's pointless to avoid me. I'm not really trying to avoid you. Oh, really? You're so stupid. Why are you avoiding him? -Well... -Well what? I just feel kind of self-conscious. Hey! Why are you laughing? What about you? When Mitsuishi said he liked you, you avoided him! -Well, it was-- -It was what? Uh... well... -I guess I felt self-conscious. -See! OK, but forget about me. You've got to make plans to do something together on Valentine's Day. OK. Sometimes, for a change of pace, you need to go out on a date, right? You know, arrange to meet somewhere. -A date? -Yeah. Nao and Uehara Done! Uehara! Sorry. Were you waiting long? No. I just got here. Shall we go? OK. Uehara... I like you. I like you too. -I'm so hungry. -Do you like me? -What's with you, Nao? -Yes, very much! Smooch! Nao! Nao! Nao! Oh, Mitsuishi. Ah! Can I stay at your place on the 13th? Sure thing. He'd find out if you baked at home. -Let's make chocolate together. -OK! Then on the 14th we'll meet somewhere. -Perfect! -What are you guys talking about? -It's a secret. -What kind of chocolate should I make? Uehara is the type that prefers volume over quality. A cake is probably better. -Uehara loves cake! -Great! Then let's make a cake! -I get something too? -Which cake? Uhm... Uehara. Uhm, Uehara. Hey, Uehara! What? I can hear you. If you can hear me, then answer! Since you've been avoiding me I thought you weren't talking to me. Jeez, you're mean. So, what is it? Are you studying for the tests? No, not especially. How can he get such good grades when he doesn't even study? Was that all you wanted? Uh, no. -So, Uehara. -Yeah? Uhm... On Sunday the 14th-- I've got work. Oh, obviously. It from the evening. Do you have plans in the day? Not especially. Then how about a date... day out together. How about a day out together? Where? We can decide that now. Why? You don't know why? It's the 14th. The 14th? Yeah... the 14th. It's Valentine's Day. Oh! Hey, didn't you know? The Japanese are the only people who get all excited over Valentine's Day. Every year they get all crazy like idiots. Really? It's pretty stupid. You may call it stupid, but I bet you get tons of chocolates at school every year. How many do you get? Ten? 50? Don't tell me it's 100! Zero! If I carelessly accepted any, they'd expect something in return. It'd be a hassle, so I don't accept any. Oh, I wouldn't want anything in return at all. Milk pudding would be enough. See, you do want something. Well... yeah, kind of. -So, where were we? -Huh? Aren't we going somewhere? You mean it's OK? Yeah. -So that's a promise? -Yeah. Really... Zero, huh? The top three must spend a very lonely Valentine's Day. Oh, yeah. Come to think of it, I did accept one. -Really? -From Yuri. I should have known... he'd accept one from Yuri. Focus! Focus! -Oh, Daichi! -Huh? Oh, good morning. Good morning. Do you have morning practice today? No. Just my own private work-out. I'll probably do it until graduation. That's hard. Don't you think so, Nao? Yeah. But as a senior, I can finally excuse myself from Sundays. Oh, I see. All the seniors have been accepted at schools, so there's a farewell game Sunday. Oh, wow! That sounds like fun! This is going to be our last game here, so everyone's inviting their friends. They want to make it like a festival. If you guys are free, why don't you come? Sunday... -Sunday's kind of... -Huh? You know, it's Valentine's Day. Oh, that's right. Us guys decided in our excitement. We forgot it's Valentine's. Sorry. Don't worry about it at all. But we'll have a big party for your graduation. Right, Nao? -Uh-huh. -I'm looking forward to it. See you. Come on, you! What's with that look? -I can't help it. -Yes you can! Why can't you just act normal? I know I should, but... You don't have to worry about him because he gets lots of attention from everyone else. You just know he's going to be popular in university. Makes me a little jealous. Hey, hold on. Nah, never mind. I told her. I told Nao clearly. OK, pass them up from the back. It's over! Yes! They're all over! Nao! Let's make chocolates! -Chocolates! -Chocolates! Chocolates! CUTE CHOCOLATE CONFECTIONS BUTTER, MILK, FLOUR, WHIPPING CREAM, CHOCHOLATE It's done! -Take it out! Take it out! -It looks yummy! -Be careful! -Uh-huh. There we go. It's so cute! Ta-da! Hmm, next one. Ta-da! Next. Maybe... No, next one. Next, next. Nope. Darn it all! Ta-da! -Uh, Nao. -Yes? -Has your taste changed? -Huh? It's like, more mature, or something. Well, that's because... Don't tell me that... you're letting Yuri influence you. I can't believe you! I mean, Uehara already told you he liked you! I know! -But-- -But what? Does it bother you? Last year at school he didn't accept any chocolates at all. But he did accept one from Yuri. Of course he'd accept it. They're chocolates from someone he likes. Oh, I mean, He liked! Past tense, right? Yeah. I don't think you need to act like an adult and dress all mature when it doesn't suit you. Uehara likes you the way you are now, Nao. Isn't that right? Uh-huh. Even if you do act like an adult, you'll never be Yuri. Wait, I don't mean that in a bad way. Wait! Hold on! Why don't you try this on? -Huh? -Yep. This might be nice. -Uh, Nao. -Huh? Have you put on a little weight? Wait! Nao! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! THE NEXT DAY Aren't you going to eat? No, go ahead. Have it. You're weird. Oh, yeah. Uehara, about Sunday, let's meet at 9:00 a.m. at the Red Brick Warehouse. Then at 10:00 a.m. we'll ride the Ferris wheel at Cosmo World... -Hold on a second here. -Huh? What's that all about? Our date schedule for Sunday. -What? -What? You don't like Ferris wheels? -No, the part before that is weird. -Huh? Why do we have to meet somewhere when we live together? But meeting somewhere is part of a date. Oh, don't worry. I'll be staying over at Marina's tomorrow. Just so we can meet? Uh, well, I've got other things to prepare too. So... Which do you like better, chocolates or cakes? -That question makes things obvious. -Who cares. Which one? The one that fills me up. Got it. Cake, huh? Speaking of which... what did you get from Yuri last year? Some cake from somewhere. What does that mean? She's also the kind that prefers volume over quality. Yeah, you're right. -Yo! -Oh, Daichi. -The tests are over, right? -Yeah, finally. That's good. So, did she do all right? -You mean Nao? -Yeah. You haven't talked to her? Well, stuff's happened. When I say stuff, I mean... she turned me down. Really? Lately Nao never smiles when she's with me. Well, yeah... I can see that. -I'm sorry. -Like I said, don't apologize. I never wanted to make her look like that. Huh? Oh, it's nothing. You mean you're giving up on her? Your meal's ready. Go ahead and eat, Nao. Sorry, Issei. Today I don't need it. What? Is something wrong with your stomach? No, it's not that. I'm just not hungry. Don't tell me you're dieting. You're dieting again? I've gotten a little chubby lately. Did your boyfriend tell you that? He's not my boyfriend! Lately I've been making a lot of chocolate cakes. I ate too much of them. Is it for Valentine's Day? -Uh-huh. -Yes! You're giving one to me too, right? -I'll take it even if you don't mean it. -Sorry, Abe. This year I'm only giving one to the person I'm serious about. I thought finally this year I'd end up with at least one. You mean you're not giving me one either? -No, I'm not. Sorry. -Wow, that was awfully direct. In any case, I don't care whether it's Valentine's Day or bikini season, you have to eat. It's store policy. I like a woman that's a little chubby and enjoys eating. Besides, how can you expect to work on an empty stomach? What if you broke another bowl? So you're worried about the bowls. Just eat already! Fine. Take care. See you later. You've forgotten to change. No, I didn't. The ramen was so good that I ate too much, so I thought I'd jog all the way home. Uehara didn't say a word. I'm serious. I just thought I'd like to lose some weight, that's all. Hey, hold on a second. -Huh? -Just wait here. -OK, let's jog! -What? I'm going to the convenience store, so I'll jog with you until there. OK. Ready, go! -What? -Hurry up! Hey! Hey, wait up! Yes? -Good evening! -Oh, Yuri! -What's up? -Uh, I just... Oh, I brought a really delicious cake. -Can I come in? -Yes, of course. -Thank you. -Go ahead. Hey there! Why are you here? Why are you looking so worried? Nothing's wrong. I just came over to give this to Nao. -Huh? What is it? -Open it and have a look. Really? It's so cute! It's a present for you, Nao. What? Really? Uh-huh. I wanted to say thank you. I caused you so much trouble. I'm sorry. Yuri... Thank you. What? -You caused me tons of trouble too. -Oh, yeah. This dress, -it also came in blue. -It's OK. I like this color. I thought so. I was sure you'd like this one more. I'm so happy. Oh, sorry. What were you saying? How's my brother? Busy, as usual? Yeah, so it seems. You're looking awfully pale. Are you all right, Yuri? I had too much to drink at an office get-together yesterday. -I'm all right. -Haven't you heard? Even if it's over drinks, strong language can affect your performance review. You're kidding! I've been meaning to tell you this for a while. What? You're the type that causes trouble when you drink. You're just fine, Yuri. Just fine. Oh, Nao. Oh, I think I'll try this on. -Yeah, I want to see it. -OK. Something's happened, hasn't it? I told you, nothing's wrong. Then don't come over suddenly like this. Oh, were you worried about me? Of course I'd worry. You're my sister-in-law after all, for some strange reason. "For some strange reason"? Jeez, you're always so emotionally unsteady. How dare you say that! How dare I say it? Then don't come over if it's not true. Why not? I can if I like. -Here. It's a cake. -I don't want it. OK, fine! Oh, here it is. That something cake from somewhere. Yuri seemed like she'd lost weight. Really? You know you noticed. Huh? Did you say something? No, nothing. Uh-oh. Aw, jeez. I'll be back in a minute. Yuri! You forgot these. Sorry. KONNO Nao. Huh? Oh, dear! -It's OK. It's OK. -I'm sorry. Oh, actually, could you taste this? -It's good. -Really? I'll try it. Yeah, you're right! Huh? What? You've got some on you. -Where? Get it off. -Your chin. That's really cute. Yuri gave it to me. Yuri sure is nice. Nao? She sure is. She's absolutely perfect. It feels like I'm becoming more and more selfish. What do you mean? Before, I thought that I didn't mind that he liked Yuri. But since Uehara said he likes me, the stuff I thought couldn't be helped... You won't tolerate anymore? No, it's not that I won't tolerate it, but... I'm not sure how to put it. You mean, "Don't be nice to any woman besides me." No, it's not that bad. That's exactly the kind of thing you should say. Nobody likes that kind of thing, when the guy you like is kind to another woman. Is that what this is? Yes, that's what this is. But, Uehara did say that he likes you, right? Uh-huh. He told it to Yuri too, right? Well, then in that case-- I know, but... But I've been around him so much. I know that Yuri's special to him. That's it! No more talk of this! Yeah, you're right. Besides, I'm going to spend all day with Uehara tomorrow. That's right. You've got to tell him your feelings tomorrow too. Now I'm getting all nervous. Jeez, Nao! Pull yourself together. -I'm worried. -Stop it! The cake is perfect. All you have to do is say, "I like you" and give it to him. I'm sure Uehara will be pleased. OK. You can do it, Nao! I will. -Thanks for coming. -Thanks for coming. You can go now, Uehara. OK. -Uehara! -Yeah? Here, this is for you. Oh, I don't accept any chocolate. I know that. Then why'd you make it? -You made me taste tons of them. -Because I made up my mind. Once I gave this to Uehara, I'd forget about him, and get serious about entrance exams. Then I'll get into the same high school as Uehara. That's still not forgetting about him. You'll still be thinking about him the whole time. Thanks. Do your best on those exams. What's wrong with you? Why are you crying, Dad? It makes me so sad to see my own daughter heartbroken. I'm not heartbroken. I'm just giving up for a while. Oh, come on, Dad! -He rejected you. -No he didn't! -Your first rejection. -He didn't reject me! -Come on, let's have a drink. -Yeah, just one more. Well, let me think. I'm quite a handful when I'm drunk, you know. -You won't be able to handle me. -Really? Yuri? I kiss everyone I see. -Cool! That's perfect! -Come on, let's go! -It feels like this was meant to be. -Over here! I'm sorry for the trouble she's caused. -Uehara? -Let's go. Hey! Hold it right there! Who the hell are you? Oh! Sorry! Sorry! This is my little brother. -Little brother? -He's always meddling in my business. Bye, Uehara. OK, let's go for another drink. What the fuck's your problem? Quit trying to push me around! Uh-oh! -Come on, let's get out of here. -Yeah. I'll take you home. No, I'm not going back home. What's happened this time? Takuya's away on business. Let me stay there tonight. Jeez! Quit it with that look! OK, fine! Then I'm going to go drinking. Hey you guys! Hold on there! Let's go. -Get in. -I'm here, Nao! -She's not here. -What? She's staying over at a friend's house. -Then I'm going home. -Hey! -It's too late to be going anywhere. -Let go of me! You OK? God damn you. -What was that for? -You liar. I hate you. I wonder if he's asleep. Oh, shit! Sorry. I'm going home. Yuri. -Hello? -I'm sorry, Nao. Wait for me. I'll be there in a bit. You overslept? Yeah, sorry. It's OK. I'll be waiting. Yuri. Takuya's going to be transferred overseas it seems. Really? I saw some documents he'd hidden in the car. TOUKEN HOME - SYDNEY OFFICE What's this? OVERSEAS POSTING OF A SINGLE PERSON APPLICATION FOR SINGLE PERSON HOUSING He'll be going to Australia. It looks like he plans to go alone. But why? You brothers are both alike. You can do everything alone. He's probably fine without me. He was probably consulting with his ex-girlfriend this whole time. They might even... be going together. What are you talking about? Things he can't say to me... he talks about to his ex-girlfriend. But I was left in the dark. This is just so stupid. Why did he even marry me if he was going to be this way? I wish I'd never married him. You've got a fever. Forget about me. Hello? Where are you now? -I'm sorry, Nao. -What? I can't go. -Huh? -Go ahead and go home. Did something happen? Does it have to do with Yuri? I'm sorry, Nao. I'll be home soon. Just wait a-- No! Huh? I knew it. You still prefer Yuri, don't you? Nao? Come on. Let's go. You said it though... that you'd gotten over her. You told me... that you like me. We'll do this next week instead, OK? Yeah, if it's sunny. -See you later! -Bye. Take care. Nao. What happened to you? You're soaking wet! What about you, Daichi? Don't you have a game? No, it's raining. Oh, yeah. I guess you're right. Nao? Daichi, you're a rain man, aren't you? No, it's you, Nao. You're the rain woman. Oh, yeah. That's right. Weren't you supposed to meet that guy somewhere? Yeah... we were. Oh, that must be why. That must be why it's raining. Sorry, Daichi. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I... I'm sorry. THIS IS A FICTIONAL DRAMA.
