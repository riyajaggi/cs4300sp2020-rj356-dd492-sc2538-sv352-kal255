 Bad! Bad! Bad! Captain, the target is still here. I'm going to give the order to go in, man. Wouldn't it be more prudent to wait till the kids are gone, Captain? In five minutes, I give the order. We're going in! I never liked kids anyway, man. Get ready! Assistant, now hand me the magic blindfold, please. The what? Assistant, the magic blindfold, the one under the hat. - I brought it from the Far East. - Dad... It's under the hat. - Dad, I'm telling you... - Honey, the blindfold. Sweetheart, the blindfold! I had to bring it, and I had to exchange it... I've been... What's wrong? What's going on? Here's the magic blindfold. Who wants magic? Do something good, you dumbass. That's the kind of audience I like: interactive and demanding. You have to leave right now. - Police? - They're close. And when it rains, it pours... I'll put the blindfold over my eyes... You're the worst! Go away! Go away! - No, no, no. - Go away! Go away! - You're up in ten minutes. - Juan. - Ready to knock it out of the park? - Mónica, what's up with him? I don't get why you're so mean to me. Tell me! What will we do with that boy? Would you mind telling me when are we're leaving this tacky party? I feel my time slipping away. Okay. Relax, relax. Honey, they're teenagers. Be patient. What's up? Are we ready? I don't know what happened, Captain. The target vanished. What do you mean? I don't know. I can't see him. I told you those damn kids were going to bring us bad luck! You destroyed every part of me When you left You didn't care that you were taking away All my hope Oh, the pain You left me with my sorrow You tore apart Every part of me We kind of got off with it, right, boss? Who hired the magician for the kid's party? I don't know. The wife, I guess. Why? I need to know everything, absolutely everything about that Juanquini. Is there a specific reason? Just because! Because I want to and because I can! Don't ask, just do as I say! I need to know everything. Who he is, what he does, what he likes, what he finds funny, what he hates, if he's happy, if he has friends, if he's sad, if he cries, what his family is like, what his wife is like, if she cooks. Everything. Absolutely everything. The business is basically carrying and distributing Luffa cylindrica in the United States. You want to start doing some shady business? Why do you say that? Why do you assume the worst of Luchito? What did he ever do wrong? Mrs. Margot, you surprise me. Besides, do you know what a Luffa cylindrica is? It's the scientific name of the sponge gourd. You want to export sponge gourd? - Yes, it's the perfect product. - It's natural. It's 100 percent natural, it's biodegradable, an astringent, self-sustainable, and besides... It's natural. No, that's not it. It's 100 percent Colombian, Mom. Think of this. Anyone who takes a bath must use soap. And everyone who uses soap must rub it in with something. Thant's why this product will turn us into billionaires in less than six months. Matías, what do think of this, my love? What do you think? Are you serious? - Matías is very intelligent. - But he's a cat. He's much more than a cat. Don't tell him that. Matías! All right. Never mind. Let's go back to the topic. You must be wondering why you're sitting there. - We want to partner up with you, Mom. - Partner. For that, we need the first injection of capital for the business. After that, we'll take care of everything. Let's have faith. Go ahead and hang up on me again, so I call you back, and you hang up on me yet again, and we keep it up like that all night. Would you like that, princess? Or else, I know where you live, so I can go pay you a visit and we can have a coffee... Hello? Sami, girls need to breathe. Give her some space, some time. No. Without her... I'll die. My soul will dry up. Mónica, you know perfectly well that the savings we have in this house are for your and your brother's education. Why do you think people study, Mom? They study to earn a degree. And why do they want a degree? To find a job. And why do they want a job? To become billionaires. We're going to skip all those steps. We'll be saving the most important thing: time. Which we don't have. That's why we're going to ask your dad. What do you think? Oh, no. He will say no. You know perfectly well that Dad has no vision. Why are you so unfair, Mónica? Your dad has worked hard to support us, and you and your brother never wanted for anything. And how did he do that? With piñatas and second-rate tricks like the one today? Mom, Dad is a mediocre magician! You can't get anywhere in life with that kind of mentality! Mediocre. SECRETS OF CONJURING GREAT DISAPPEARANCES ON STAGE FLOATING BODIES - Will you not have dinner? - No, thank you, sweetheart. I'm not hungry. I want to stay here and work for a while, okay? I left some food in the oven for you. Thank you. But don't be too long. You need to rest. No, don't worry. Come on, Matías, stay calm. Don't bite. You have nothing to worry about. It's a mere act of magic. To make something disappear on stage has always been my greatest wish. And my greatest failure. Maybe Mónica is right. I'm serious. To date, I haven't been anything more than a mediocre magician. Relax, nothing bad is going to happen. And you know what? Thank you. Believe it or not, you're helping me gain self-confidence. From now on, you're my best friend. Abracadabra! Magic. Abracadabra! Matías. What went wrong? There it is. It's written there. Damn it, Matías. Matías? Matías? Matías. Matías. Look, Samuelito, me not liking the cat and me hurting the cat are two different things. All right. I'm going to give you one more chance. Where is he? I don't know! I don't know. It's not my cat. Where is he, murderer? - Psychopath! - A murderer, that's what you are. - Come on. Where is he? - I don't know. Tell me or I'll set the house on fire. - I don't know! - Where is he? - Tell me where he is! - Margot! Hold on. What's all this yelling this early in the morning? Please! Matías disappeared, and I'm sure this weed-haired block is to blame. Let's show some respect. Explain to me what she did to him. I don't know. But I'm sure this harpy made Matías disappear. Mrs. Margot, could you tell this millennial vampire that I have far more important things to do? Okay, kids, let's relax and go find him together. No, no, no! What for? Cats like to wander. It's all normal. Good morning, my boy. Good morning, princess. Good morning. Sometimes they go away for a couple of days. It's normal. But they always come back to where they are loved. - Loved and cared for. - Mom... I've lived in this house with Matías for two years, and every single day, every single one, Matías wakes up next to me. Every day. There it is! And they wonder how come the poor cat hadn't run away before! He needs us. I heard him meow this morning. He makes that noise when he's sad, you know it. I looked for him everywhere, all over the house, and I couldn't find him, but I heard him. I have an idea! How about breakfast? Family! He's over here. Matías? Nuts! He's nuts! LOST - MATÍAS CONTACT 3234589764 Hello. Hello, I need to talk to the magician Juanquini. Yes, who's calling? Someone who needs to hire him for an event. Yes, good afternoon. I'm Margot Bocanegra. I'm Juanquini's wife and manager. I handle all his bookings. Where and when is the event? We offer a multidisciplinary show, and we're not exactly cheap. A multidisciplinary show? Yes, we complete the magic show with a young singer-songwriter who has beautiful songs and very meaningful lyrics. Look, we only need the magician. Yes, but it's either the whole package or nothing. Okay, then tell me your conditions. That's all right. Tell the magician and the whole package that I will be expecting them around 1:00 p.m. at the address that I'll send now. Great. Thank you very much. It's done, Mr. Heriberto. With all due respect... I find it strange that you want to have that magician at that party. Why? Is he that good? Let's say he's just what I need for a plan I have in mind. So that he can explain something that happened to me. If everything goes according to plan, the magician Juanquini will get a surprise he never saw coming. Sorry. Sorry. Captain! Captain! We found out that Ñato Orduz is throwing a huge party, the old bastard. He's going to go all out, Captain. They're celebrating that two years ago they made a shipment to the US. - Imagine. - Good, damn it! Very good! Tell me we have the damn coordinates to the party. Yes, there they are. What do we study them for? Great. You and I will handle this quietly. We won't tell anybody until the very last moment. - Understood? - Okay, great. - No. Not "okay, great." - No? - Okay, excellent! - Excellent! Yes! Now he says he has lost his inspiration and he wants to slit his wrists. - Again? - Yes. He suffered two great losses simultaneously. His girlfriend... - What do you mean "two"? - Well, Matías is still missing. Life is shit. That's it. And today we have a show. What am I going to do? Don't worry about that, Mrs. Margot. I'll stay with him. - I'll take care of the poor guy. - Hold on. You think you're getting out of it that easily? No, honey. Go get ready because this is a family business, and here we all do our part, all of us! Coming! I'll get it! The sponge gourd is here! - How are you, Juan? Sorry. - How are you? - Mona, we're here! - No! Yes, ma'am! Five thousand of them brought directly from Palmira, baby. - Did you count them? One by one? - Of course. - Mónica. What did I say about this? - Don't worry. You don't have to give us a dime. They're giving it to us on consignment. Whatever we don't sell, we send back. No, but where will I keep five thousand sponge gourds? That's nothing to worry about, Mom! Don't you see this business will make us rich? Anyone want to tell me what's going on here? No, right? One, two, three! Five thousand sponge gourds from Palmira, honey! JUANQUINI AND HIS WONDERFUL MAGIC SHOW Let's get to work. You must be Juanquini and the whole package. - Mr. Quiroz. - Yes. Did you get here all right? Yes, fine. It's quite far, isn't it? As they say: "Where the wind blows and takes a turn." You three, stay here. You, come with me. The boss wants to say hi to you. Follow me, move along. It's okay. Everything will be fine. Stay with him. Mr. Juanquini! Welcome! - How are you? - Fine. Better by the minute. Look. - I'm a big fan of yours. - Thank you very much. How was the ride? All right. There was a little traffic at first... Excuse me, your name is? - Ñato. - Ñato. To be honest, I wasn't expecting this type of party. You know? I don't see kids anywhere and... If you want me to, I'll go. Tell me where they are. I'll put up the piñata. I'll do some tricks and disappear. There are no kids here. The only girls you'll find here are these two cuties. You will die today, magician... but of happiness. I'm throwing a hell of a party! Make yourself at home. This magician is fucking great. He's the best. Quiroz, offer the man something to drink and see if he needs anything. No, I came here with my family. You came here with someone? Entertainment is our family business, and we always work together. Look, magician... Welcome, all of you! All of you! Cheers! Cheers! You're going to reject my drink? Have fun, magician. That guy looks just like my father. The same bearing, the same demeanor. How I miss my daddy, for God's sake! Thank you! Why live? If I don't want to live anymore Day by day, everything loses its color Its color I discovered love does no longer exist Samuel. Life is shit - You'll sing that for the first time here? - No, it's a work in progress. Life is shit Beautiful. Very nice. Rubbish Why live? I don't know why Mónica insists on those funny businesses when she should be producing you. You're a gold mine. Everything loses its color And it's... Mónica wants me to sing reggaeton. Reggaeton? No, not reggaeton. Your music is meaningful. It has a message, Samuel. And that... What happened? We are next. St. Juan Bosco, please... Give me your magic. Here it is. Here it is. Sir. Mr. Quiroz. - Can I ask you a question? - What do you want? Well, I'd like to know when we are up. They had told us our show was scheduled in the afternoon. When Andy Rivera is done. And how long will that be? Because that guy has sung the same song eight times. What can we do if the boss likes it and we have to wait until he gets bored? I like it. I like it. I think it's a very nice song. I love it. We all love the song. All of us. - It has rhythm... Tropical rhythm. - We really like it. It's the same song over and over. - Attention, Peloefique, attention. - The road is clear. - How far? - We're 30 minutes from target, Captain. Roger. My friend! Thank you for that beautiful, touching song. I don't want you to leave. No! No one leaves! Maybe I feel like listening again to... Any problem with that? No! Right. If he doesn't behave, we won't get him the Grammy. Friends, partners, ladies, I want to introduce to you someone very special. A man full of artistry, strength and good energy. I present to you the wonderful Juanquini! Put your hands together, damn it. Juanquini! Behave. I'm going to make a call. Tropical magic. Where are the daddies? And the mommies... The respectable ladies. All right, we're going to begin with a simple trick. Assistant! The coin! Assistant? Thank you. Here we have a magic coin. We're going to take it with this hand. And now with the power of our minds, we're going to teleport it to the other hand. So, Captain? How do we approach them? We're going to let them get a little more drunk, and then we go in. Learn, Ortiz. I'm not going to be around forever. Yes, sir. Tropical... magic. Listen, you idiot! Do something worth our time! Yes... I like that! An interactive and demanding audience. Do something worth our while, or you'll leave here in a coffin, you mediocre idiot. - Samuel. - You better respect me. What's going on? I'm not mediocre! Magic is an art. Perhaps you don't understand it. But you can't come and sabotage me. No. There are people here who are having a good time. You better... You better tell that babe to take her clothes off. Yes! Come on! - That's it! Enough! - Hold on! You came and took us for fools, did a crappy trick, and you're just going to leave? Yes, Dad. We're leaving, right? - What do you want me to do? - Something to amaze us. But you're drunk. You're all drunk. - Who's drunk? - You're drunk. Either you do something that makes our jaw drop, or we do target practice with you. You think you scare me? No, sir. No, my dear friends. No, no, no. I come from North Jardín. I'm not a coward. Who authorized a shooting? Boss, that magician is terrible. Your wife is terrible! - Oh, yeah? - Stop, calm down. Let's all calm down. Show the magician some respect. He's an artist, and in this house, we respect art. But you said our jaws would drop, and he hasn't done anything. I'm not going to let him rob you just like that. The show was just starting. Look, magician. The people here are more demanding than what you are used to. I need you to help me out. But what do you want me to do? Show them your talent, please. You are masterful. Do something shocking. Yes, I'm masterful. And I have a shocking trick. But I don't know if you will have everything I need for it here. - You know? - Master, we have anything you need. Just wait and we'll get it for you. - No... - Yes, master. You know we will. I will help you. - Yes, come on, master. - What do you need? Move along. Thank you. Bad! Bad! Now! Master, I'm sorry I couldn't get the box you wanted, but I had this in the back, in case someone misbehaves. No, that's okay. It's not the exact material, but it will do. Mediocre! Calm down, all of you! The master needs to focus. Quiet, please! Be quiet! Master, the stage is yours. Tropical magic. I'm going to make someone disappear from this coffin. For that, I need a volunteer. - No! - Me! - Could be a woman, could be a man... - Me, me, me! Master, master. Here! You? Am I not good enough, you fool? No, no, no. Of course. Let me hear it for the volunteer! All right! All right, then! - Now, we will close the coffin. - Here we go. This will take a lot of concentration. Hey! Please make me disappear because I can't stand my wife anymore. See you Monday, guys! Concentration! Assistant. What the hell are you doing? I have no idea. They're going to kill us. Calm down. Let's calm down. Let's both pray. Juan Bosco, father and master of all the magicians in the world... Are you ready? We're going in. I'll follow your lead. Concentration! Abracadabra! He did it! Bravo! Bravo! Tropical magic! Bravo, bravo! Now bring him back! Bring him back! Bring him back! - Bring him back! - Concentration! Quiet! Abracadabra! - What happened? - What happened? No, as I had told you, the material is not the same. So, in those cases, the volunteer stays in another dimension. They can't get out. There's no other dimension, no more tricks. Bring the boss back right now. Bring him back! Come on. Concentration! Assistant. You have to bring that man back, Dad. They're going to kill us. Let's breathe. Princess, let's breathe. Let's calm down. How long is it going to take, sir? Patron saint, what did we say? What did we say? Come on. Boss! Tropical magic! Bring him back now. Everybody, stay still! Now, now, now! Freeze! Everyone to the floor! - Come on. Come on. - No! No! I have nothing to do with this. Get down on the floor! Come on, now! Nothing? - Nothing, Captain. - Let go of me! - Did you look thoroughly, man? - Yes, every nook and cranny. We set up a three-kilometer perimeter, and we haven't found him. People say this guy made Ñato disappear right before we came in. - I can explain. - He says he's a magician. - Are you kidding, Ortiz? - No, it's true. - A magician? - Yes, sir. Yes, officers. A magician. The girls that were livening up the party made a video. We can analyze it. I only came because I had a professional and artistic commitment. My name is Juan Morales. They know me artistically as Magician Juanquini. We do piñatas, first communions, baptisms, birthdays, anything for kids. And we have discounts - for the Federal Police. - And who hired you? Quiroz, a guy named Quiroz. My wife handles the bookings. So the sergeant here is right. When we started with the operation, you made Ñato disappear? Exactly. And today was the first time I tried that trick. Congratulations. It was a success. - Isn't that right, Ortiz? - Yes, congratulations. And the missing person? Where is he? I don't know. Something went wrong. I don't know what happened, but I couldn't bring him back. Bring him back? From where? I don't know. Let me get this straight, you clown. We're supposed to buy that silly story? I swear on my family, what I love the most in my life. Believe me. I swear. Now what? What are we going to do? I don't know. I don't know. Subtitle translation by Maria Belen Bustos
