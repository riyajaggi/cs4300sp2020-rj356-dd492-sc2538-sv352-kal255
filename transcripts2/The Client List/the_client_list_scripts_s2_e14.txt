 Previously on The Client List... I'm home. Welcome home. Sean Foster, the guy that attacked Lacey... I think he wanted the list. The baby? - We're gonna try again.

 With this man overseeing things, what could go wrong? You are setting me up. Every move they make, I'm gonna know about it. I've got your back. Do you have mine? - I always do. Mr. Carlyle, have you met my friend, Detective Monroe? Nikki was just coming with me. I miss you, baby. I miss this. Now you just need to get me that list. Someone trashed Riley's office. I told you I would get you the list. You didn't think I could smell the deception? Get out! If anything happens to the list... - Georgia, I got it. Hey, so...

 If you guys are watching this, um... Your mama had to go somewhere for just a little while... But your daddy's gonna take good care of you and everything's gonna be okay. I love you very much. Okay, so, this is everything. From both accounts? Business and personal? You want to talk about it? No. Mmm-mmm. Not really. Riley, if there's some kind of emergency... You know what? Also, I need to make sure that the house is in Kyle's name only. Okay, this is not my place to say this, but given his record, are you sure that's a good idea? He's not leaving. Are you? No. No, I'm not going anywhere. As your banker, I do what you ask. But as your friend, I got to say, I'm worried about you. Look, I'm just trying to take care of my family, okay? What is there to be worried about? Okay. Riley? Yeah? You out here? Yep. Out here. What are you doing? I was just taking the trash out. I did that earlier. Yeah, I know, but you forgot about the recycling, so... Yeah? When did you start smoking again? You know what? I don't have time for a lecture right now. So maybe we could just save this till later. Whoa. You want to stop and tell me what's got you so agitated? Did I do something? No. No, you didn't, okay? I'm sorry, I'm just... Being a business owner's not all it's cracked up to be. I know you need support, all right? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I talked to Coach Steff this morning. He thinks he may have something for me at the high school. Riley, I know I've been trying to get something going. I think this is it, and I have a really good feeling about it. Good. I think I'd be a great coach. Hey, what are you doing out here? Are you smoking again? Yes, I was! I'm gonna leave you to talk with Smokey the Bear here. We'll talk about this later. Okay, why would you start again when you know how hard it is to quit? First of all, this is not up for discussion. Second of all, let's not make this some damn PSA. What has got your panties in a bunch? You know what? What is your news? Well... There is big news. Something big is happening. Dale and I are being considered for an adoption. Oh, my God! You're gonna be a mom? That's great! Well, we still have to meet with the expectant mom. But she handpicked us from a pile of other applicants. I mean, so there's that. So, when is this gonna happen? Later. But Dale is trying to beat the nasty weather in West Texas, and he's not sure he's gonna be back in time. So, you think you can come? Oh, uh... Really? I'm on the fast track to mom-hood and you have to think about it? What's this? Look, if something happens to me, help Kyle take care of the kids. Riley, you are scaring me. What is going on? Just do me a favor, and don't ask me any questions. Are you kidding? I'm gonna take care of it, okay? Ah, come on! Go get that baby. Oh, hey. Oh! Hey. Uh, how's that task-force thing going? Oh, it's good. Yeah, we're, uh, closing in on something big. It's gonna be headline news. You wouldn't believe the people involved. You're staying safe, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. We're trained for this. You all right? You seem... No, I'm... I'm fine. You know, I should get going, so... Okay, listen, um... Being a Ranger, all the things I get to do... I wouldn't be doing it if it weren't for you. So, thanks. We've got Rangers all over the state closing in on suspect Greg Carlyle. We're tracking his finances, and we've got reason to believe that his profits are from prostitution and suspected human trafficking. We've put surveillance cameras in his two main bases of operations, Wild Nights, and the Violet Orchid. Trimble, Parks, you'll be the locals handling the surveillance at Wild Nights. Yes, sir. All right. Let's get back to work. You know this girl? No. I never saw her. Works for Riley. Name's Nikki Shannon. Riley had me help her out of a situation with Carlyle a couple months back. Appears she got sucked back in. This was taken a couple of days ago. Well, we got to tell Riley. This is a formal investigation. Everything needs to be done by the book. She could be in danger. What if she's mixed up with something bad? Well, that's what we're going to find out. You're not smiling, and you're not asking for a drink. What's wrong? It's bad, Georgia. It's real bad. The client list is gone. I'm sorry. Did I hear you right? Uh-huh. I thought you took it out of The Rub... I did. I did, and I put it in the one place where no one was gonna find it. But someone did. I told you to be careful. I thought I was. You see all of this? I'm not losing this. I am not losing Harold. You've got to shut this down. Okay. Look... I think it was Carlyle. All right, now, didn't you tell me that he was... Didn't you tell me that he offered you money for The Rub? You only get one chance to kill a snake. You have got to cut its head off and crush it. Dale, future baby mama is here. Are you close? Call me. Or better yet, just get here. I guess it's, uh... It's just gonna be me. The hubby's trying to get here. He's out trucking, you know? "Get out of the way!" You know, I'm not gonna lie, picking your kid's parents is kind of weird. But the truth is, I can't do it on my own. My ex-boyfriend, Billy, bailed, right after he found out I was knocked up, so... Total dick, right? So... Here I am. This must be really hard for you. Oh, I practically raised myself. I just don't want my kid to grow up lonely like I did, you know? Hey. Sorry. You do not have to worry about us not being there for that baby. I'm here. I'm here. Hey! He's here! Okay! I'm sorry. Dale, this is Kim. Hi! Kim! Kimmy-Kim! Kim-Kim! No, just Kim. Kimo-sabe! It's just Kim. Just Kim. I'm gonna stop talking 'cause... She's the one with the questions. I'm sorry. Go. Um, well, I just want to get to know you guys, find out stuff that wasn't in the application, so... What do you do for fun? Uh, we... Uh, we... We love to take care of our best friends' kids, Travis and Katie. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, and I bake, as you can see. Yeah, oh. Sometimes we take walks. And, oh, oh, Dale... Dale loves to watch reality TV. Honey, just, uh, making us sound really boring. We, uh, go to the batting cages. Oh, I'm sorry, and the batting cages is the "not-boring" thing? Uh, all right. Well, I'm in a rock band. No, he's not. A band? That's awesome. You okay? It's hormones, uh... You guys seem fun and, like, just the right amount of weird. And I can tell you love each other like mad. Just a little bit, yeah. Eh. You know what? I like you guys. I wish I had had a mom and dad like you. Well, you know what? You play your cards right, we'll adopt you, too. How's that? Dale! It's too much? Sorry. A little bit. Your kid is gonna have a great family. What? Wait, really? Are you serious, really? Oh, to hear you say that. That is so great! I thought she blew it. Hey! I really thought we were blowing it. Okay, well, I should go before this turns into some weird cry-fest and we're forced to hug it out, so... Oh, no, get in here. We're gonna hug it out. Come on! Come on! Oh! I got a doctor's appointment. You'll come? Doctor's appointment? Oh, yes! Yes! That's awesome! We would love that! Okay. Okay. Okay. Bye. We're getting a baby! Get in here! Oh! The baby! We're having a baby! - Yes, we are! Wow! Oh, my God! Get in! I said I had your back and this is how you repay me? By e-mailing me threats? Okay, I have no idea what you're talking about. "Shut down the task force in 48 hours or your activities at The Rub will be made public." What? Are you crazy? You'll notice it's addressed to Mr. Louboutin. I didn't send you this threat, all right? I have as much to lose as you do. You better find out who's behind this and fast or we are all going down. Get out of here! What's that? My house key. I don't want it. Not what you said last night. Oh, you are such a child. Look it's just a key. Not kissing in public. Not a marriage proposal. It's just a key. Mmm-hmm. I hear you. Still not taking it. Ah, probably wouldn't work anyway. Reverse psychology won't get me to play house. It means more sex. I know what it means, and you're freaking me out. Fine. That makes two of us. You, uh, lose something? The client list is gone. What? You think it was one of us? No, Overton said that he was threatened and that it came from here. Okay, wait, wait, wait. It wasn't me, okay? Blackmail ain't my thing. I think it was Nikki. Oh, I knew it! I knew I couldn't trust that girl! Ooh! With those damsel-in-distress eyes, and that voice... Please! I want to watch while you fire her ass! Selena, do you understand me? If we don't find that list, The Rub is gone, and we all go to prison. Okay. All right. She's in room seven. Let's go. Come on. You guys aren't here for a couple's massage? Actually, we just need to talk to one of your employees. Nikki Shannon. Is she here? She is... Popular today. Uh, can you go get Nikki, please? What is this all about? Ranger business. Can I ask you some questions while we wait? Yeah. Okay. When did you hire Ms. Shannon? Uh, a few months ago? Did you check her employment history? Yes, she was working at Wild Nights to pay her way through college. Stripping? Yes, um... Sometimes hiring a girl with a past can be a gamble. Monroe said that he responded to an incident involving you, Nikki, and Greg Carlyle. Did, uh... Did Nikki happen to mention him since? I heard y'all were looking for me? Uh, yeah. Here you go. We need to take you in for questioning, Ms. Shannon. For what? This may take a while. We appreciate your cooperation. Oh, God. Wait, wait. Here. Oh, God! You all right? I'm okay. What the hell happened out there? Shh. I don't know. Nikki got herself into trouble. Client list trouble? I'm not sure. Could be anything with that girl. Selena... Hey, if this has anything to do with what you and I do in those treatment rooms, you better tell me right now. Look. Riley's handling it, Okay? Well, it didn't look like it. Derek, we got to trust her, okay? Just don't worry. So, it turns out your friend Carlyle or the companies he controls own 23 strip clubs all around the Gulf Coast. I don't know anything about that. So, you're telling me you don't know anything about human trafficking, prostitution, drugs, weapons? No, sir. Really? 'Cause you've been taking off your clothes with these gals for about three years now. Thought y'all would be all kinds of chummy, sharing your deepest, darkest secrets. I was just trying to work my way through school, minding my own business. I haven't seen him... ...in a long time. That right? Well, you, uh... You seemed real cozy with Carlyle last week. Reese had me trace Carlyle's dummy companies. Even though you're not on the task force? For now. You're not gonna believe who one of these companies employed. The guy who broke into Riley's house works for Carlyle. Now one of his strippers works at The Rub. What are you saying? I'm saying that's quite a coincidence. All Riley did was give that girl a job and get her away from Carlyle. Riley didn't know what she was dealing with. Ever the loyal brother-in-law. What's that supposed to mean? You're the Texas Ranger. Figure it out. You want to know the sex? Yes. It's a boy. - Yes! No, I would have been really stoked if it was a girl, too. No. I would have been! But that is... That is awesome! Come on! A little baby-man for me to watch football with. Oh, he's such a little bean. Look at him. Oh. He's smiling. Did you see that? I think so. Yeah. Or is that his tush? Is that his tush? I don't know. I couldn't tell. Billy? What are you doing here? Um... Can I talk to you for a minute... Alone? They're the adoptive parents. They can stay. I don't want to give up the baby. Or you. You should have thought of that before. Yeah, well, I was scared. We're young and... We've got our whole lives ahead of us. But I'm not scared anymore. I'll call you guys later, okay? Sure. Of course. Okay, um... We'll be home. Okay. Where's Nikki? They finished questioning her and released her. Evan, I want to know what the hell's going on. You know I can't tell you. Come on. Cut the Ranger shit. I'm family. We need to talk. Parking lot, now. Good. Look, I know that you're risking your job. The guy that broke into your house and attacked Lacey. Wait, Sean Foster? What does he have to do with Nikki? Foster works for Carlyle. Oh, my God. Lacey. Any idea why these guys would break into your house? I mean, I don't know. Maybe 'cause it's payback, you know, for helping Nikki. Look, I know you thought you were bailing this girl out of a bad situation. But she is not worth it. Wait a minute. Wait. When was that taken? A few days ago. You need to keep your distance. Oh, I will. You understand? This cannot be like last time. You cannot take this into your own hands. Yeah, I get it. Riley, promise me. Thank you, Evan. Kyle. Hey, Coach. Oh, it's good to see you. You, too. Thank you so much for this opportunity. Sure. Really. Uh, I lost my old playbook, but I spent some time watching game tapes. I drew up some new stuff for the offense. I really feel like I could add value, Coach, in any position. Son... I got you a job, but it's not that kind. With all the bad publicity, I just can't have you on the coaching staff. Uh... The job I got for you is maintenance. But, you know, down the road, things can change. Coach. Maintenance. Really? I know. I understand. The bottom line is, I need a job. You always said chop some wood and a tree will fall, right? Yeah. Well, I'll chop some wood. Good. We'll see you Monday. Thanks. All right. Hey! Dude, nice arm. Yeah. You used me to get the client list? Do you know that I risked my life to help you with Carlyle! I trusted you. No! Someone broke into my house because of you! My best friend lost her baby because of you! I never meant to hurt anyone. Please. You have to let me explain. Explain what, Nikki? Explain how you lied to me over and over again? Now get up right now! Let's go! Carlyle threatened to kill me if I didn't get the list from you. I followed you. But I dug it up. And I didn't give it to him. I have it. Well, then where is it, Nikki? Let's go! I got it. I got it right here. Where is it, Nikki? It's okay. It's okay. I'll give it to you. Open your trunk! I'll give it to you! It's in here. Where? It's in here. I promise it's right here. I swear to God, Nikki! It's right here. He has it. Carlyle has it! No. Riley, I am so sorry! You're dead to me! Do you hear me? Dead to me! How could you? Riley... No. Riley! I've only got time for good news. I was right about Carlyle. He's got the list. I said good news! You know what? I'm gonna get it back. How are you gonna make that happen? Is your head in the damn clouds? This is over. We are over. No, we are not over, okay? I'm gonna survive this, just like I have everything else in my life. And how are you gonna get it, huh? You're gonna waltz into Wild Nights with a plate full of cookies and ask politely? The man's a sleazeball. If you try to get this list back, he's going to kill you! Georgia, would you keep your voice down? Please. Now, can't we just, I don't know, talk to someone on the list? And tell them what? That they're about to be exposed? Well, we have to do something. We? I got out of the business. It's about time I wash my hands of it. This is your responsibility. This is your mess. No, Georgia, you are not leaving me right now, okay? You cannot jump ship. Riley, you're on your own. No, I have a deed, and your name is on it. So, therefore, I am not on my own. The man's a monster, Riley. I'm scared. I'm just scared. So am I. Thanks for coming down, Shelby. We're pulling you off Evan. What? One of detective divisions needs a trainee on the night watch. The commanding officer picked you. That means I'm... I'm... As a detective? Temporarily. If you get called up permanently, you'll be the youngest female detective I.A. has ever had. Internal affairs? That's right. I need you to watch Evan for me. Our investigation may or may not involve his family. Need to make sure he's on the right side of things. You'll be notified for your briefing. You do realize I'm in a personal relationship with him? Why do you think I.A. asked for you? You want the promotion or not? How about Elliot? Elliot's a great name. Elliot. Elliot. Oh, come on! Not even a grin? That was my best E.T. I... I don't understand how you can be so confident now? My mama hormones are making me Zen. You... You do realize, though, that you're not actually the one who's pregnant. It's gestational simpatico. Okay, I don't speak Spanish. Is that a real thing? Yeah, they did a lot of research on it. Honey... This is not about some crazy internet science article. This is... This is real. This is about a girl about to walk in here and tell us that she's not giving up her baby. You don't know that. After everything that we have been through... After everything that you've been through... When you lose something, you get something back. That's also a scientific fact. But you saw the look on her face when her boyfriend walked in. She's not giving up that baby. I guarantee you she would not be coming here to give us bad news face-to-face. Okay, really? Yeah. Honey, I just... Hon, what's the matter? I, um... You guys are the parents I wish I had. You're truly the most loving people I've ever met. You changed your mind. I think my water broke. What? What? Are you okay? She's... She's having a baby. I'm gonna get a towel. Okay. Okay. Okay. Just stay with me. Just breathe. Call 911. 911? She's having the baby, and we are gonna help her. Hey. Hey. How you doing? Pretty good... Considering I almost gave birth in a hair salon. That's true. It makes for a great country song if you want it for your band. That's not a bad idea. Anyway... Thanks. I couldn't have done it without you guys. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Well, we'll... We'll let you get some rest. Take care of yourself. Uh, look, if you need anything, just pick up the phone and call, all right? Wow. We have a baby. Actually... You know what you said about us being young and having our whole lives ahead of us? Well, it's true. And I don't trust that we're in it till the end. But those two... They are. And when I look into our baby's eyes, I don't want to deny him the chance to have parents like that, you know? A life like that. But... As hard as it is, we both know it's the right choice. Okay? The National Weather Service has issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Jefferson county. Strong winds have been reported with... Forty-eight hours? Nine hours ago. Thirty-six until yours truly is front-page news. There's no way that you can stop the task force? The task force is set in motion, darling. It is massive, and it is statewide, and nobody's stopping it. I've got a search warrant sitting on my desk right now just waiting to be signed. Who's it for? Wild Nights. They're moving in on Greg Carlyle. Okay, look, that threat you got? It's from him. He's got my client list. You keep written records? What the hell were you thinking? I'll tell you what I was thinking, I was thinking life insurance. Bum policy when it's in the wrong hands, isn't it? I'm gonna fix this. Let's hope so. You just let me know when you sign that warrant. Okay, high chair, stroller, car seat. Yep, yep. Oh, my God, Dale. We don't have a car seat. We got a car seat. How are we gonna get him home? Kyle's bringing us a car seat. Boom. Okay, diapers, bottles, formula, changing table. Yeah. Okay. Oh, my God, We have nothing. Hey, we got our son. We got everything. Boom! You're right. I'm just nervous. I mean, most parents have nine months to prepare. We had a day. It all happened so fast. Yeah, but humankind didn't cease to exist just because they didn't have the all-terrain stroller... Although we're definitely getting one of those. You see the tires on that thing? It's like... ...Bigfoot! Coming through! We can handle this. We're Locklin's. Boom! And now there are three of us. Boom, boom, boom. Boom. You still freaked? Mildly. It ain't gonna happen, cowboy. See, I'm confused. You say you're traditional. You want to get married. But on the other hand, you hate PDA. But then when we get home, all you want to do is hump like bunnies. See... You said home. That's what I'm afraid of. By the time you get done here tonight, it's gonna be late. I'll already be in my bed. Naked. You could let yourself in. Okay. But only 'cause you're gonna be naked. It's gonna be kind of like a hotel key. I'm gonna give it back at the end of my stay. Okay, so, why do they call it swaddling? I don't know. Should we know that? Yeah, we got to Google that. Hey! Look at you! Hey! Parenthood's already looking good on you guys. I'm good. I'm like a new man. Can you see the spring in his step? Yeah, I call it my daddy mojo. Thank you for this. Yeah, of course. Aw, you just missed the baby. The nurses just took him to the nursery. Oh, I can't wait to meet him. Hey. You want some help with that? It's not as easy as it looks. No, no, are you kidding me? Hey, I can take a motor apart and put it back together during lunch break and still eat a burrito. I think I can handle this. Okay, I'll figure it out. Lacey, I'm so happy for you. I know how long you've been wanting this. It's pretty crazy, right? Yeah. So, is Riley coming? I left her a message. And I know she's been really stressed-out about work. Yeah, I mean, I've tried to call her a bunch, too. Yeah. I mean, she's missed a lot of stuff 'cause of work, but she wouldn't miss this. Not me getting my son. No. I... I'm worried. Hey, you have enough to worry about. All right, you're a new mom. I'm sure she's fine. And she'll be here as soon as she can. Yeah. You're probably right. Hey, it's me again. I'm at the hospital. Lacey and Dale are wondering where you are. You got to come by and see this little baby. Call me, please. Hey. Is Riley here? No. No, I haven't been able to reach her all day. Hey, have you ever seen this guy? No. What's going on? She in some kind of trouble? This guy's connected with someone Riley hired at The Rub. I think she might be trying to help the wrong person. I'm gonna go look for her. All right, you tell them I'll be back. Okay. Hey, another Parks brother. You got to come in and meet my son. Lacey was all worried, and I was like, "Hey, you know what? "Everything's gonna be okay." Is he cute? Cute? He's a Locklin. Yes, he's cute. What is this? Aw, thank you. Hey, listen, I... I got to run. Riley might be in a little bit of trouble, but, um... What? She okay? Yeah, I'm sure. Just tell Lacey I said "Congratulations." Uh, yeah, yeah, he's only gonna get cuter. All right. Go be a cop. Hey. I got here as fast as I could. Aw, look at the baby! What is wrong with you, Riley Parks? You can't just hand me a stack of cash, tell me to take care of your kids, and then not check in. I was worried sick. Now talk. Someone took the client list from me. What? What... What are you... What are you gonna do? I'm gonna get it back. How? I got a plan. Can... Can I help you? Just... Be a good mom. You can do that. Hey. Lacey, do not worry about me, okay? I'm gonna be fine. I worry about you every day, doing what you do. Every day. Want to meet Cole Locklin? Yes. Hi. You're moving around a lot tonight. Wild Nights. Now the hospital. How's your friend Lacey? What are you doing here? You got what you want. Except nobody called off the task force. I don't have any control over that. You know, that's funny... 'Cause I thought your brother-in-law was working it. When he got his badge, I bet little Travis and Katie were so proud. You don't... Don't talk about my family. Little edgy? You know, I don't know if your business has an exit strategy, but right now would be a really good time to put it into play. Have you ever worked the pole? I bet you'd be really good at it. See you real soon, Mrs. Parks. Riley! What the hell are you doing? I've been calling you. Come on. Let's go inside. No. No, doesn't it feel good? I mean, like it's gonna wash all of it right away. Riley, I know that you're in trouble. What the hell are you talking about? I talked to Evan. He told me he's investigating some thug that you're somehow connected to you. Why didn't you tell me any of this? What is going on? I didn't want to worry you. You didn't want to worry me? I'm already worried. But I can deal with this, okay? On my own. Riley, you don't have to. That's what I'm saying. I'm here. All right? I'm not going anywhere. It's because you already left, Kyle! And you know what? For the first time, I get it. I get just wanting to pack all your shit and just run away. But I can't leave. Just tell me what it is, all right? I can accept it. I can't tell you. What? That night that I got arrested, you started to tell me something. What is... Is this what it is? I can't breathe! Riley! Riley! Riley, what are you doing? Sync by TheDoktoR
