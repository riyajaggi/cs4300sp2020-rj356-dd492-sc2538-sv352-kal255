 The Client List (2012–2013): Season 2, Episode 9 - Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy - full transcript 
 Evan is happy, about to graduate at the police academy and start his rookie training, while his romantic affair persists. Riley enjoys a law school-dropout client who pays her as nude model. Kyle does a great job as father again, especially with school-frustrated Travis. SElena is served divorce papers from her mismatched ex Joey Corsallini but refuses to part with the luxury horse she considers 'a child', even if that may easily lead to far too dangerous questions about The Rub.

And so is you being a father to my kids. Shelby, you free for dinner tomorrow night? Thought you'd never ask. You never take your shirt off in here. You girls couldn't handle it. Let's see if he meets up to the Selena standard.

 Is it wrong that I occasionally imagine myself alone with Derek? You're jealous. Please. She can't do this, though. ♪ Oh, twist it ♪ shake it, shake it, shake it, baby ♪ You got the band back together? Daddy played guitar? Yeah. He was pretty good at it, too. This is complicated. I'm gonna earn my way back into the house. I mean, I can take them to school. It's okay. We have a routine. Do you let Evan take them? Don't go there. I have enough on my plate with mom in rehab and... What? You missed a lot. I slept with someone.

Perfect. ♪ Go somewhere in the nation, not in my house ♪ Yeah, the way the light hits your hair with that screen behind you, it's angelic. You know, when you said you wanted something different, I didn't think you meant this. Well, I feel like, uh, Picasso with his mistress. I can't believe I never thought of this before. Normally, I would do this from a picture, but I assume no photographs here. Oh, definitely not. So, is this just foreplay, or... How you want to spend the rest of the hour? No, the whole hour -- it's the best money I ever spent. Okay, well... you got 35 minutes left, so knock yourself out. ♪ The Client List 2x08 ♪ Save a Horse, Ride a Cowboy Original Air Date on May 5, 2013 == sync, corrected by elderman == Whew, am I glad this day is over. Yeah. What are you? Rose from the Titanic? Hey! You know what, Selena? He is an artist, and I am his muse. Yeah, I bet you really help get his creative juices flowing. So does this mean we're back to business as usual? You done repenting your sins? I don't think I'll ever be done. I have to make a living. You're up early. Well, I got 10 minutes to get the kids for school. You know, Riley cuts Travis' sandwiches in the shape of -- Trains? Yeah, got it. You know, the trick is doing that every day and not bailing. It's all right. I got it. I can clean up my own mess. So you're really gonna be a cop? Well, somebody's got to keep the bad guys off the streets. Right, 'cause you're such a good guy. Hey. I'm not late, am I? Nope. Come on in. Are the kids ready? They're just brushing their teeth. They'll be out in a minute. Okay, here are their lunches and Travis' words for his spelling test. All right, I'll quiz him in the car. I-I made their lunches. Oh. Okay. No peanut butter, right? Honey-banana -- their favorite, and I queued up the goodbye song. Good. I'm gonna go get them. I really appreciate you letting me do this. You know, Kyle, we, um, still haven't talked about what happened in therapy. Yeah, and I-I'm not saying that I have any right or that it's even logical, but... the thought of you with another man destroys me. And -- Daddy! Daddy's here! Whoo! Yes! Hi. Oh, you guys ready for school? Yeah. Bye, babies. Bye, mommy. Bye, mommy. Bye. I'm gonna beat you. Last one there is a rotten egg. All right, buddy, be only a few more minutes till school starts. You want to run this play again? Yep. All right. "Supermarket." S-u-p-r... Hey, come on. You remember what the reading tutor said. You don't need to rush it. I'll never be able to do it! Hey, don't say that. Let me tell you a story about your daddy. When I first started high school, I was a really fast runner, but Coach Steff told me that I didn't have a strong enough arm to play quarterback. So you know what I did? I practiced every day. I went into the gym. I lifted weights. I got my muscles big and strong. And before you knew it, I was throwing the ball way downfield. And guess what. You won the state championship. Boom. But I don't have strong muscles like you, daddy. But you got something better than that. You got a strong brain, and that's what we're doing here. We're working out your brain, right? So let's do this again. "Supermarket." S-u-p-e-r-m... a-r-k-e-t? Boom! That's what I'm talking about. You know what? You get one of these. What's that? Coach Steff put one of those on my helmet every time I threw a touchdown. Come here. You're gonna do great. I'm proud of you. Morning. Morning, sunshine. You certainly are glowing. Well, thank you, ma'am. Think that you could spread a little bit of that warmth my way? Are you feeling okay? I was just thinking. Might be fun to go grab dinner after work one day. ♪ So keep it coming, keep it coming ♪ Okay. The way that you protected me from Carlyle, that was really something, and I never got to thank you properly. Well, that -- that's awfully sweet of you, but thank you. Just think about it. A guy like you deserves to be something more than... fun buddies. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yeah, baby! Y'all are looking at the proud owner of a one-of-a-kind vintage crocodile clutch. Just outbid my online purse nemesis, Clutch23. Someone's extra chipper today. You got a problem with that? Okay, retract the claws, ladies. We open in 10 minutes, and I have a few things that I would like to talk to y'all about. It's not my client. Unbelievable. Hello, we are not open yet. How can I help you? Is this 15001 Primrose Avenue? Yep. It says it right there on the door. Sorry, ma'am. But you've been served. Oh, my God. Are these from Kyle? Selena? What? You're married? Huh? Oh. Whoa, wait. Wait. Wait. You're married? Selena. You're married? Maybe on paper, but I haven't seen the guy in like four years. Uh, you know that "on paper" is what makes it legal, right? Legal, shmegal -- where's the closest Kinko's? I'll have this divorce done by lunch. Yeah, not so fast. We need some details. Look, you. I know that it's juicy. But you have a client, so... What? Is this high school? Pretty much. Yeah, I mean, spill it. Who is this guy? Uh, I met the guy five years ago at a horse auction, and, uh, he won me a horse. Oh, that's romantic. Um, no. Not when you got to pay for it yourself. Oh. Yeah. He told me he was some big real-estate developer. More like a big con man. Guy didn't have a dollar to his name. Yeah, well, that's a deal breaker for you. Obviously. And then, like, two months later, I catch him cheating on me with the girl next door. Literally...next door. He's been living in Fort Lauderdale ever since. Okay? We good? Can we get back to work now? So you feel nothing for this guy. Oh. Oh, I feel something all right, like kicking his ass in front of all these nice people, but you're not worth ruining a good pair of shoes. Oh, I guess you got the papers. I was hoping to get here first, give them to you myself. Why? Hmm? Why now, Joey? I met someone, and she's a really nice girl. And I want to get married. Again? I thought you'd be happy for me and for you. It's the girl I'm worried about. I mean, what kind of con did you pull on her, huh? Hey, Selena, we have customers coming in, so why don't y'all go knife each other elsewhere? So, a nice girl, huh? What the hell is she doing with you? Why is that so hard to believe? 'Cause every syllable out of your mouth is a lie. That's not true. Mm. My point exactly. So, what? You want me just to -- just to sign the divorce papers? That's it? You make me sound so cheap. Come on. It wasn't all that bad, was it, Lena? Don't. What? This has nothing to do with Tommy? What about Tommy? I ran into him last week. Yeah, he was, uh...he was commenting on my fancy Corvette and complimenting me on my Gucci. You know, I should have known that fathead would call you. Well, I don't want your cash. No, but, um -- but there's one thing. I want custody of Henry. Hey. Hey, man. Uh, glad to see you're out. You have no idea. Lacey tells me that you're bunking with Evan. How's that going? It's going. Look, Dale... You know how sorry I am about everything. And I am on a mission to do right by everybody. Yeah, so I hear. I need a job. You think you maybe have anything at the trucking company or the warehouse? Man, I'll carry boxes. I don't care. Um... Yeah, I mean, I can try. Thank you. You know, I got a job for you. Grab me my sticks. Come on, chop, chop. Let's go. Is this your drum set from high school? Yes. Is it? Don't act so surprised. They're in great shape, aren't they? Wow. Yes. Okay, well, this is why I don't throw anything away. Lacey makes fun of "Storage Wars." Those people know what they're doing. Wow. God, you remember those days? Oh, yeah. Me and you -- the Ring Pops. Right? Oh, my God. We had Lacey and Riley eating out of the palm of our hands. One, two, three, four. Yeah, look at you! You know, he doesn't give a crap about Henry. He hasn't seen him in four years. And now he wants custody? I am the one that feeds him. I am the one that bathes him. I'm the one that loves him. Selena, you never even mentioned Henry, not even a photograph. I mean, can you honestly picture that irresponsible ass mucking out his stall? I mean, it's -- it's like funny. Oh. We're not talking about a kid, are we? You know what? We might as well be, okay, because that horse is like my baby. Ooh. Mean, I love him just as much as you love your kids. Well... Or, you know, if your kids were like horses. You know what I'm saying. That rat bastard -- he's trying to take him away from me. Ha! What did you see in that guy, anyway? He reminded me of my father. Don't ask. Uh, no, we're asking. Charming, funny... A lying sack of... You know what? Were not doing this. I'm not doing this. Can he really take Henry? You know, I'm not -- I'm not sure. I mean, I guess legally he's entitled to half of everything, right? You know, Selena, you need a lawyer. Are you kidding me? Those guys charge more than I do an hour. Well, we have to do something. Okay, first of all, we don't have to do anything. Okay? I mean, I appreciate your help and all, but I'm not one of your clients. I can clean up my own shit... And my horse's. There you go. Thank you so much. Hi. Hey. Ooh, you brought me lunch? Yes. Your favorite chicken sandwich. Oh, and that good potato salad. Ooh. What's in the envelope? Just a flier advertising your husband's rock-'n'-roll band. Wow. I can not believe how official this all looks. It's cool, right? Oh, that is not going in the window. Why not? Kyle Parks on the guitar -- are you kidding me? Pick a side, Dale, and I better be on that side. Hey. Look, I'm on Evan's side. It's just...You can't deny that Kyle is trying. Oh, why didn't he try and be there for his wife and kids? I mean, you have no idea what Riley had to do to hold that family together. What are you talking about? I've been here the whole time. I know exactly what she's had to do. Look, I don't approve of what Kyle did -- not at all. But it doesn't matter what you and I think. He's Travis and Katie's daddy. And if he's happy, that's good for the kids. Oh, so that just earns him a spot in your band? Look, we grew up with the guy. It looked like he needed a gig. That's all this is -- a-a jump-start. He is not the big football star we all used to look up to, Dale. You seriously want me to kick him out of the band? If you want that poster in the window. Wow. You got to do some thinking. I suggest you talk to Riley. 'Cause I don't think I'm the problem here. Are you saying I'm the problem? I'm taking the good potato salad. You just gave me stress hunger. When you graduate, you're officially gonna be boots, which means the only thing lower than you is shit. Now, apparently, I drew the short straw, and I'm stuck with this group when you graduate, so any mistakes you're gonna make, make them at your cadet party 'cause tomorrow you are all officers of the law. Any questions? Good. See you all at graduation. Sir, just wondering, how do I fast-track to homicide detective? 24 hours, and this will be our home. Pretty cool, huh? I cannot believe I made it. Why? You earned it. Yeah, I just -- I've done a lot of things, but nothing's felt like me. I mean, I played football 'cause my brother did, did construction 'cause my brother did. This is the first time I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be. So, it's just the job, huh? I thought you graduated first in our class? Don't worry, Henry. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. We're a team, buddy. Just if Joey shows up, do me a favor and kick him in the nuts. Yeah, about that. Isn't he beautiful? Yes, he is. Yes, he is, and he's my number-one man. Yes, he is. Well, as the other man in your life, I'm kind of surprised your ex-husband never came up in conversation. Well, it's like I said. It's just paperwork, wasn't important. Wasn't important to tell me that you're married? Well, why would it be? We're not playing house, Derek. We're fun buddies. You know, I keep saying that word. Would you do me a favor? Would you try and talk some sense into her? She seems to love you. I do love you. Don't I, Henry? Hey. It's late. Is everything all right? Yeah, it -- it's more than all right, actually. Can I come in? Sure. What is it? I wanted to invite you to something. The Ring Pops. Yeah. I'm playing a gig with Dale on Sunday. Wow, really? I thought maybe I could get my guitar. Oh, sure. I'll get it for you. Uh, the train sandwiches, by the way, were a big hit. And Travis, he did really well on his test. Best score ever. Yeah? Well, you know, when he slows down a little bit, he doesn't mix the letters up as much. I think that tutor you got him is -- is really helping. Yeah, if we stay on him. We can do that. You know, and I was also thinking -- I mean, if it's all right with you -- I'd like to set up a schedule for me to bring the kids to school, you know, now that I know the goodbye dance. Oh, they taught you that. Oh, yeah. They got that whole arm motion down pretty good. Yeah. It's nice to see you smile. Look. I know you're busy. I don't know what you have going on with work, but it'd be -- it'd be great if you could come watch me play. Are we in the free zone? The what? The place where I can safely say what I feel without getting blasted. Of course, always. Good...'Cause I'm not on board with this whole Kyle thing. Okay. You care to elaborate? I mean, he's only been home a couple of days, and he's already taking the kids to school and playing in Dale's band? I don't trust him, Riley. Okay, I'm not asking you to trust him, okay. I'm not 100% either, but I can promise you that he is not gonna hurt us again. You can't promise that. You may not remember what it was like when he walked out. Oh, Lacey, I remember. Do you? 'Cause you were a complete mess. It almost destroyed you, Riley. Yeah, but it didn't. Travis and Katie are the closest thing that I have to my own kids. If he disappoints them -- Look. I have my doubts, too, okay? That's why he's not staying here. He's trying, and I have to give him a chance to try and make it right. Well, I think that man used up all his chances. Okay, Lacey, I've got to get to work. Why don't you go find Kyle, you know, teach him about the free zone? Why does everybody want me to be talking to someone else? I mean, God, it's like I'm never talking to the right person. Lord. Well, aren't you just a handsome officer and a gentleman? Come on. Turn around. Let me get a better look at you. Thanks so much for altering this. I'm so proud of you. An officer of the law -- I mean, they don't just give those badges to anybody. Well, I couldn't have done it without all you guys supporting me. Hmm. So, how are you doing with, uh, Kyle being back? That can't be easy. You have no idea. Yeah, well, if it were me, I would have kicked him to the curb. I hope that chair of yours is real uncomfortable. Yeah. It's got its lumps. Good. You know, I miss you guys. Feels like I'm always training or studying. Oh, well, I hope you're having a little fun. I mean, you can't work every second. I am -- I am having fun. What is going on with you? Are -- are you seeing somebody? Oh, my God. You are. I'm not sure. Ah, come on. Spill it. I want her name. Okay, well, her name is Shelby. But, you know, it's -- it's early, so we'll see. Well, it's too bad that things didn't work out with you -- Yeah, well, you know... It's -- it's for the best. I know. I'm almost done with my sketch. Yeah, I can see that. And then I'll paint it. You really love your job, don't you? Mm-hmm. I actually have my first gallery showing this weekend. Your first showing, Victor, that's...that's amazing. Yeah. I'm excited. You seem excited. Okay, what's going on? When I quit law, my parents stopped speaking to me. You know, my dad's a lawyer. His dad's a lawyer. They just couldn't accept that I wanted something different. The thing is, I -- I always imagined my parents at my first art opening. Well, did you invite them? We haven't spoken in two years. Families aren't easy. Sometimes, they're downright disappointing. Yeah. You can say that again. You know what I've learned lately? You still got to try. You should call them. Maybe. I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to -- No. I love that you want to help me. I just want to finish this sketch if that's all right with you. Sure. I'm gonna do this one in acrylic. You're not gonna see my face, right? I know the rules. Do you mind if I break one of my own rules? I'm not gonna lie. This isn't good. He's entitled to half your marital assets, including your salary. Okay. What about Henry? It says here he wants Henry or half of his value, which is 30 grand. Wow, that's a lot of money. I mean, what is he? Royalty? He's off the track, so he's related to a lot of fast horses. Okay, so wait a minute. If Joey's entitled to half of Selena's assets, what about half of Joey's? He claims to be a real-estate guy, but hasn't made a dime in years. I could have told you that. All right, so what if I just, um, refuse to settle. The guy's savvier than that. He applied for a forensic audit. What the hell is that? Opening up all your books. Joey could clean you out. I don't got books, all right. I mean, just tax returns. Yeah, and tips. Since you're an all-cash business, anybody could see that your returns don't add up. The problem is his next move is gonna be to look at your employer's books, see where you're getting your cash. My suggestion -- give him Henry. I'll let you two think about it. - I'm here if you need me. - Thank you. Look, Selena, we cannot let Joey get his hands on the books here at the Rub. You know that, right? He's bluffing. No, not in this case. He knows that you can't afford all those handbags and a Corvette on that salary. Look, he doesn't care about Henry. He'll sell him five minutes after he gets him. Then you're gonna have to find the money somehow, because if you don't, you, me, and this place -- we're going down. Hey. Hi. Raspberry with powdered sugar -- your favorite. And yours. Yeah. My mama didn't raise me stupid. Mm. Mama, you're shaking. It's not as bad as it looks. Really? No. It's a bitch. Yeah, you never were a good liar. You and me both. When did life get so hard, mama? One day at a time, sweetheart, just one day at time. At least, that's what these smartass counselors around here say. You know, if you ever want to talk about this -- All we do around here is talk. Tell me about the kids, and Lacey, Dale, Evan. And Kyle. And Kyle. Uh, hey, Selena. What are you doing? You know, this isn't good for business, right? I mean, he can't stay here. Oh, calm down. I wasn't planning on it. That guy's just helping me move Henry. There's a stall opening up in a day or two at some secret location. Uh, where is it? Well, if I told you, then it wouldn't be a secret. So you're not selling him? Would you sell your kid? I mean if your kid was a horse. Okay, you're gonna have to come up with the money, plain and simple. Look, I told you I can handle it, all right. I just need to find this damn bridle. Oh, good. Here it is. Thank God for these bags. He's got a lot of gear. Selena, is that a diaper bag? Yeah. Took me 12 hours, but I finally wore down Clutch23 -- As if she needs a diaper bag. And you do. You can never have too many bags. Maybe you can. I have an idea. Okay, vintage clutch -- $800. Ooh, uh, Hermes h-belt -- $200. Whoa, whoa. Are you kidding me? It's a fire sale. We have to take what we can get. I'd just like to point out that we could be servicing our customers. Yes, but by helping Selena, we're helping ourselves. Now get back to work. What's this worth? Oh, uh, $400? So 100 bucks an inch? Ain't that how you charge? If I was, I'd be getting $1,000. Uh, let's hold. Wait, um, what? Whoa. Wait. Wait. Just don't. No. No. No. Unh-unh. No. Not this one. What? I had this when I lost my virginity. Your virginity -- oh, so you've had that since you were 15. My Rub virginity. Come on, it's sentimental. Look, I get it. It's hard. But they're just possessions. You said it yourself. I mean, Henry's like your baby, right? Yes. Okay, so then what's it gonna be, Henry or the handbags? Come on. You can do this. Yes! I just sold my first purse. Why you all looking at me? Hey. You just missed Evan. I'm not here for Evan. We go one round or two? If I went there, you'd be K.O.'d in a minute. Fair enough. Look. I'm glad you're here. I -- if I'm gonna get clear with Riley, I want to get clear with you first, and you and I haven't had a chance to -- Don't do that. What? Get in front of it like that. I am running this free zone. All right. I'm ready. What are you up to, Kyle? What do you mean? I see Riley warming up to you. It makes me nervous. And I don't blame you. You're looking out for her, and she's lucky to have you. Damn straight. But, Lacey, you have to understand that I love her, too. You know, when you left...Do you -- do you have any idea how hard it was to watch my best friend break down like that? I am not proud of what I did, but I am here now. Yeah, and Riley's doing great. I just don't want to see you ruin that. One day at a time. That's how I learned to live my life in recovery, and that's how I plan to win back the love and trust of my family, and that includes you, Lacey. I'm keeping my eye on you. You may be able to charm Dale, but I'm not that easy. I'm gonna be watching your every move like a hawk, even when you think I'm not looking. Okay. Thought you could use this. Thanks. To Henry? Mm. Look -- I know you think this is, um, stupid, you know, me being upset about all this stuff, but... It's history, you know. Like, I-I don't know, baseball cards or jockstraps or whatever it is you guys collect. I get it. You want to take your mind off this for a bit? Um... You know, I don't -- I don't think I want to be fun buddies anymore. So what, do you want to go steady? Hell no. Relationships are nothing but trouble. I mean, look where this one got me -- six Louis Vuittons and four...Guccis lighter. What we had was awesome. You don't get a medal for being unhappy. So that's Kyle -- after all this time. Yeah, that's him -- up close and in the flesh. I can see why you fell for him. Just promise me you'll be careful. I promise. Liar. All right, let's talk about something important like your wedding. Oh. Yes, girl, let me see that rock. I thought you'd never ask. Georgia, that is beautiful. That was just about the most romantic proposal I've ever seen. Hey, you know what? Dale's was charming. Yeah, if you like your face plastered across the Jumbotron. Yeah, go Astros! Go Astros! Hello? Hey, Shelby. What's up? Why, Evan Parks, is this a booty call? What? No. This is not a booty call. Really, 'cause it's past 10:00, and it sounds like you're at home, which officially makes it a booty call. Listen, I'm about to be a sworn officer of the law. It would my duty to disclose if this were a booty call, which it definitely is not. You talk too much. If you want this, you got to earn it. That's why I was calling. I wanted to take you out again. I think that can be arranged. Well played, by the way. This was not a booty call. You keep telling yourself that. Bye. You coming to hear him play -- what's that about? I'm just sitting here with you two girls, listening to some music. Mm. Let's be honest. This is not just about the music. He's trying. I know he is. Yeah! - Yeah! - Whoo! Beautiful, beautiful. I'm gonna go see my man. Go see him. Well, I'm really glad you came. You were great. Thank you. I felt like a kid again. Yeah, me too. Hey, do you remember that time in mama's backyard When we were playing and you thought you were Stevie Ray Vaughan? Whoa, hold -- no. I've never compared myself to Stevie. Um, okay, but your guitar solo was... It was epic. Yeah, I know. I was gonna say very long and unexpected. You know who loved it? Linette. Linette. Yeah, well, she had earplugs. How's mama doing? Harder than she thought, but she's gonna get through it. ♪ Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now ♪ Yeah, I was thinking about maybe going to see her if that would be okay. Wow, that would -- that would be really sweet. Thank you. I have something for you. ♪ Just tear me down Kyle, what is this? Well, I got a few days unloading trucks. Dale gave me an advance. Okay, this is -- It's not -- it's not much. I know. I just -- That's not what I was gonna say. Well, before you say anything... I just want you to know that I'm gonna do whatever it takes. ♪ That I should have bought you flowers ♪ ♪ and held your hand ♪ should have gave you all my hours ♪ May I have this dance? ♪ When I had the chance yes. ♪ Take you to every party ♪ 'cause all you wanted to do was dance ♪ ♪ now my baby's dancing ♪ but she's dancing with another man ♪ ♪ although it hurts ♪ I'll be the first ♪ to say that I was wro-o-o-o-ng ♪ ♪ oh, I know I'm probably much too late ♪ ♪ to try and apologize for my mistakes ♪ ♪ but I just want you to know So, I was thinking about having some of my cadet buddies over before graduation. That's cute. You gonna do each other's hair and makeup? Yeah, something like that. Anyway, it's gonna get crowded and some of the guys can get pretty rowdy. I get it. You don't want your cop buddies hanging out with the brother that was arrested on TV. Do whatever you want. I'm just telling you what the plan is. Yeah, well, looks like I could use a new plan. I was gonna get out of here anyway. Where are you gonna go? I'll figure it out. Is Riley letting you back in? Yeah, see, that's none of your business. I'm moving on. Yeah, well, I'm moving on, too. I don't remember asking. I thought you were moving on. Not the greeting I was expecting. Sorry. Just got rid of an unwanted visitor. Should I be jealous? Definitely not. Come on in. You know, if I didn't know any better, I'd think this was a booty call. If it's the booty calling, it's not a booty call. Is that so? Mm-hmm. Well, as long as you'll respect me in the morning. It is the morning, and the goal is to respect you a little less. ♪ Lay me down on sheets of cotton ♪ ♪ whoa, whoa ♪ you make me feel like I could fly ♪ ♪ headlights on the bedpost, we ain't stopping ♪ ♪ 'cause Charlie ain't home ♪ ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ ooh, ooh, Charlie ain't home ♪ ♪ ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪ ooh, ooh, Charlie ain't home ♪ ♪ ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh Okay, um, black Prada Hobo... ♪ Charlie ain't home ...has that box gone out yet? Uh, it's right over here. Why? New owner's asking. He just bought the Chloé bag, so we'll put them both in the same box and save on shipping. Where is the black hobo bag? Selena. Really? Are we still doing this? What? If these were your Louboutins, you'd be crying. Not if it meant keeping my kids. Now where's Derek? I don't know. Working the Derek magic. We did it! Wait, we sold the last one? Okay, all right, wait. What was the total? It comes to $12,142.53. Yeah, we're still like... $17,857.47 short. It's not over. There's only 12 grand here, and I'm entitled to $30,000. You ain't getting Henry. Well, then you better figure something else out because this is chump change. I can't. Do you want this deal done or not? Hey, you know what? How do you feel about driving a Corvette there, Joey? Well, now we are negotiating. I knew you still loved me. You know what? You're gonna take the money and the car and you're gonna forget about Henry. Not so fast. Joey doesn't disappear that easily. Hmm. Kind of like an STD. I got that treated. Ew. My spidey sense tells me if you're willing to part with the car and the cash, well, there's more you're hiding. Extortion 101. Yeah, the negotiations have ended. Negotiations end when I say they have, doll face. Right now, I'm thinking that maybe my guy should do a little forensic accounting. Maybe he can figure out how you can afford a Corvette and all those blingy bags giving back massages. You know what? That reminds me. I have to call my client back. You know, the one that just happens to be best friends with the district attorney in Florida. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He might be interested in that, um -- that real-estate scheme you had going on in Daytona Beach. He would be interested. And, oh, he's got a good one in Delray, too. Whoa, whoa, ladies. There's, uh -- there's no reason to roll around in the mud. Aw, but that's where the pigs live, Joey. Well, usually, I like to be kissed after being bent over a sofa. You know what? Um, there's one more thing. I thought you might want this for, uh, sentimental reasons. Oh, that's too bad. That was real high-quality cubic zirconia. Well, I'm gonna need a ride home now. Yeah. You've got Henry. Excuse me, Henry. Hey. What are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be at your gallery opening. I'm on my way there now, but I wanted to thank you. Uh, I think I should be thanking you. You know, I thought about what you said about my parents, about family. Did you call them? I did. And? And they're meeting me in 15 minutes. Oh! That's so great. Wait. Here. Oh, my God. It's just beautiful.

We have a long road ahead of us, but... Are you mad? Of course, I'm not mad. Okay. I just want you to be happy, and I got your back no matter what. I'm just gonna have to take it one day at a time. Oh, you talked to Kyle, didn't you? I did, and I know he's trying. He just better try real hard is all. All right, who wants a big dog in a hot bun? Come see the master. - Gotcha! - No, you didn't. Hey, where's your girlfriend, by the way? Shelby, right? What? Sorry. Lacey tells me everything. Girlfriend, huh? I knew that glow couldn't just be from the Academy. Oh, no. She's from the academy, all right. ♪ I won't let you go How about those -- those hamburgers, huh? I ll be your burger bitch today, but tomorrow you're grilling your own burgers, all right. You know what? This is a good time. Hey, let's raise a glass for the newest member of the Beaumont police force, Officer Parks. Hear, hear. Yeah! Criminals out there, take heed.
