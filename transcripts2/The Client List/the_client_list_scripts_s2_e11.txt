We only have a 10% chance of conception.

 If Vandermeyer Construction were to recoup their losses, they'd most likely drop the charges against Kyle. Vandermeyer steals from everyone. That guy is nothing but trouble. Harold could be my last chance at love. What are you grinning at? Nothing. Derek doesn't look at me like that. I don't want to be fun buddies anymore. You want to go steady? Hell no. Hey, are you shitting me?! Who is that guy, huh? Greg Carlyle. He owns Wild Nights. It's in the best interest of everyone that I own the Rub. I got a buyer. I hope you don't regret it. Riley, whatever you did with the client list,

 make sure it's good and hidden. I mean... What was Georgia thinking? I think it's supposed to be romantic. Frankly, my dear Lacey, I do give a damn. Well, it's not so bad. I mean, if we could just remove some of this fabric. Oh, well. I guess we can make it work. Oh, that's the spirit. Oh, who am I kidding? I look like a big, giant Easter peep. Go ahead. Take your best shot. I can handle it. Wow. Well, you make any dress look beautiful. Oh, there may be hope for him yet. Good morning, Lacey. Kids ready? They'll be out in a minute. Hey, Travis, Katie, let's go! Look, I know that you worked the night shift with Dale, so you sure you're not too tired? You kidding? Taking the kids to school is the best part of my day. I swung by the motel, got a change of clothes. I'm good to go. Thank you. Yeah, I just want to do whatever I can to help out, which is why I want to take you on a little adventure. Adventure? Like Indiana Jones? Like I'm not telling you. It's a surprise. I don't know. I just thought with kids away at day camp tomorrow -- I don't know -- I got a little something special planned. Like a date? Yeah, like a daytime date. Yeah, I know you do so much for everybody. I want to do something for you for a change. I like the sound of that. All right. I'll pick you up tomorrow. So, it's a...date. So, guess it's a date, huh? It's a date. ♪ The Client List 2x10 ♪ What Part of No Original Air Date on May 12, 2013 == sync, corrected by elderman == You, sir, are a bad influence. I really should go. As much as I like wearing your boxer shorts, I haven't been back to my place in three days. What's wrong with that? I could get used to you here. That's sweet. I just have some stuff I have to take care of before our shift. Well, at least let me make you breakfast. I'm really not hungry. Everything okay? Yeah. It's just...I have to go. Yeah, I can tell. You're practically running out the door. I like you, Evan. I like you a lot, and it scares the hell out of me. There's nothing to be scared of. Do you know how hard it is to be a woman on the force to be taken seriously? Do you want to stop? No. It's just... I had three older brothers who taught me to never let my guard down. And you and me getting close, it's -- it's hard. Well, I know all about putting up walls. And when it comes to messed-up older brothers, I think I got you beat. I haven't felt this way about someone in a while. You're worth the risk. Now let's go back to being bad. Hey, is that a studded-strap Louis Vuitton barrel bag with a magnetic snap? I lost my Louis virginity. You mean my virginity. That's my bag, isn't it? You sold it... And the bag. Give me that! That's chili. You did not eat your white-trash chili dog with my $1,100 Louis vuitton purse. Which I bought for $300. Besides, I was hungry. Calm down, Selena. I just want to have some nice things in my life, too. Besides, you're already having fun with Derek. You're not. Ooh... You listen here, single white female. You can buy as many fancy purses as you want. But Derek -- he's off limits. You got that? Not that you could get him if you tried. Thanks again for the purse! Hey. Oh, lord -- why don't you just call up Georgia and tell her you're not wearing that thing? Because I can't do that. I'm just gonna have the tailor fix a few things. It'll be fine. Oh, yeah. Keep dreaming. I've been in over 10 weddings. I know an ugly-ass bridesmaid's dress when I see one. Good lord. Over 10? Mm. Got a big family. Well, it's Georgia's day. This is what she wants. I'll just wear it with a smile. Have fun. Hey. Morning, Riley. Morning. Oh. Problem in the workplace? Yep. I got a nosy-ass boss. She called me the boss. You are a dream come true. A dream? No, I am not, 'cause dreams don't come true. But fantasy -- yes, I am, 'cause I always deliver. Yes, you do. Hey, thanks for fitting me in. I really needed to see you before tonight. Yeah, what's going on tonight? Something big? Possibly. I met this woman -- Penny. She's spectacular. I mean, she can cite every member of the Cowboys' offensive line by memory. She's a Cowboys fan? I didn't say she was perfect. Tonight's our first date. Okay. So you don't want to be distracted. By wanting to get into her pants? Exactly. Got it. I always go too fast, screw things up. I get it. You really like her, so you wanted to come and see me first. It's man logic, I know. "Man logic." I suppose I could have taken care of myself before I went out tonight, but you do a better job. Well, that is true. Okay, so, killing two birds with one massage. I get it. Now, this Penny -- she seems real special. She is. That's why I want to focus on her as a person, you know, woo her right. Wow -- it is hard for us girls to find a guy who knows how to woo us right. I think I can help you with that. ♪ You're gonna shoot me down ♪ you're gonna shoot, shoot ♪ ♪ you're gonna shoot me down ♪ shoot me down These are for you, my lady. Aww. Thank you, kind sir. My favorite. So, is this proper adventure attire? It's perfect. Your carriage awaits. Oh. Are you taking me hiking? Because if so, you should have told me. These boots -- You can guess all you want. I'm still not telling you. Ugh. Okay, you know what? Today is a personal day. The kids are safe. We're happy. I'm turning that thing off. Nice. I know how hard you work. That must not be easy. Well, it's easier than you think. Oh, my God! Horses?! Yeah. We got them for the whole day. Mazur Ranch is just over that hill. Oh, my gosh. They're so beautiful. You know how much I love riding. Yeah, I do. That's why I got them. Today is for you. Now, I haven't been on a horse in a while, so... Don't make fun. You're gonna do great. You know we haven't been riding together since high school? Oh, I remember. That was the first time you let me kiss you. It wasn't the first time I thought about it. Oh. Look at you getting up there like a pro. Yeah, well, we're not moving yet. Thanks for doing this for me. Of course. Anytime. All right, let's see what you got. All right. Here goes nothing. Come on. Yes, that's right, Linette. Inez wants to look more Linette Montgomery and less Marilyn Monroe. Inez wants my color? Well, I guess imitation is the highest form of flattery. This looks blond. If I put that on her, she's gonna look like a creature from "Avatar." I heard that! Do not make me "Avatar." You people burnt me last time. Oh, good lord. Are you still whining about that? Shh! Well, I can't -- you'll be fine, Inez. Find the color. She's mid-bleach. Okay. Just look in the back of the display, top shelf. I am looking, honey, but we are plumb out. Well, I may have a few spare bottles, uh, at Riley's, under her sink. Well, isn't that nice to know? Thank you. Apparently, Linette has her own secret stash at Riley's for her own touch-ups under her sink. Note to self. Charge Linette for extra supplies. Okay. Well, I've got a key to Riley's. If I rush, I can be back in 20 minutes. Inez, you're gonna cook for another 30 minutes. Taylor's gonna keep an eye on you, okay? I swear to God, if you burn me -- I can't hear you, Inez. You owe me one, Inez. Riley? Someone there? Riley? Stop him! Somebody help! He broke into the house! Somebody help me! 911. Yes. Hello? Yeah, I've been attacked. Somebody just broke into the ho-- Oh! Oh, my God! Somebody help me. Ow! Oh...God! Here you want some apple. Thanks for the ride stud. You don't want any? Oh, no. You're playing hard to get. Okay. Hey, Dale. You sure? Yeah, she's with me. We've been riding all day. Her phone is off. Why -- yeah. Hang on. It's Dale. Okay. Hey, Dale. What's going on? What? Oh, my God. Okay, yeah, I'm -- I'm o-on my way. It's -- it's Lacey. She's hurt. We got to get to the hospital. All right. I'll drive you. Then I'll pick the kids up from camp. Okay. Whoa. Oh! Sorry. Note to self. Can't do five straight clients without stretching. Forearms? I hate that. Here. Let me give you a hand. I like you, Derek. I like you a lot. You find me sexy, don't you? Of course I do. Then let's give it a shot. We should at least see if we have any chemistry. If not, then we'll stay good friends. Nobody's feelings get hurt. But... If this is as hot as I think it's gonna be... We could have something really special. ♪ Is your love ♪ big enough for what's to come? ♪ ♪ Baby, let me know ♪ is your love ♪ big enough for past is done? ♪ Wash my back? ♪ Baby, let me know All your tests have come back normal. Okay. You hear that? Tests are normal. You're gonna be fine. As a precaution, we're gonna keep you here a few days to make sure there's no internal bleeding. Best thing you can do is get some rest. Dale, did you hear that? She said that there's internal bleeding. What? What? Oh, my God. My organs are bleeding out. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I know something's wrong. She didn't say that. And you just need to chill, okay? I know exactly what you need. Hey, "Brothers and Lovers." I don't think I'm really in the... Pull up a chair. How could you, Cassandra? Simon, you were in the coma for so long. What else could I do? Okay, could you explain this to me again? Yeah, Simon and Cassandra are married. Mm-hmm. So, Simon fell into a coma. Okay. Cassandra started dating Simon's brother, Xander. Okay. That would never happen. And who named somebody Xander? - I don't know. - Lacey?! I'm fine. I'm fine. Just a little bit banged up. I'm okay. Oh, thank God. I can't believe you found someone breaking into my house. He was -- it was in your bedroom. And I just tried to stop him, and then he ran, well, right over me, apparently. But I'm just so happy that the kids were not home. Okay, guys, you know what? Let's just relax. You heard the doctor. Lacey's fine. The baby's fine. The baby? Dale. Uh-oh. Wait. Are you -- are you pregnant? Nice, Dale. I'm sorry. It just slipped out. No, no, no! You guys, are you pregnant? Since we had so much trouble conceiving, we wanted to wait until the three-month mark before we told anyone, but -- Oh, my God! I'm pregnant! That's why I've been drinking alone! Oh, and the pickles. Oh, my God. You ate so many pickles. Okay. Got it. Riley, can we just keep this a secret until we -- Yes, yes, yes. Of course. Auntie Riley will take care of everything. A baby! Okay. Wow. Oh. Hospital. I'm so sorry. I'm so bad at that. You're okay. A baby. I know. We're so excited. Oh! You know, the police were already here dusting for prints. Yeah, well, I am the police, and I was just stopping by after my shift to make sure Riley was okay. Yeah, well, that's very thoughtful of you. But I'm here now. She's fine. Is Lacey all right? She's okay. She's gonna have to stay in the hospital for a few days, but she's all right. Kids? They're good. They're sound asleep. Good. I checked the perimeter -- locks, the doors. Nothing's broken. You're safe here. Thank you. Hey, you know, um...Lacey did get some things on this guy. He was in an old Cadillac with license plate, uh, R73. He also had a scar on his cheek. Yeah, no, I know. It's all in the police report. I promise you -- we're on it. Uh, do you have anything else so far? Well, the detective did say that this was not a random break-in. And what does that mean? It means if this was just a smash-and-grab, the guy would have trashed the house, but nothing was out of place. The locks weren't even broken. We didn't want anyone to know he was here. This guy was after something specific. Look. What -- what can I do to help? Nothing. Just let the authorities handle it. I'll make sure we follow up on every lead. Lacey's family. Damn right she is family. I need you to drop everything and go and get this guy, okay? You promise me? I promise. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Aah! Sorry. Hey. Veil or no veil? No veil. I need to talk to you privately. All right. What is going on with you? You're acting like you've seen a ghost. Someone just broke into my house, and they attacked Lacey. Is she all right? Yeah, she's gonna be fine, thank God. But I think he was after the list. Why are you saying that? Because he didn't steal anything. He was looking for something specific. Well, the client list holds a lot of power -- blackmail, revenge. Georgia, do you think it was Carlyle? It's possible. Carlyle has been after the Rub clients for a while. He even made me an offer to buy the spa. Wait. He what? Yes, and I immediately turned him down, of course. And the client list is safe, isn't it? It's safe. I've been real careful. But they just broke into my house. I mean, they've threatened my family. What am I supposed to do? Well, in a business like ours, you have got to protect what matters, and that is you and your family. And, honey, there is nothing... that I wouldn't do to protect my family. You understand me? Georgia, look, I've -- I've crossed a lot of lines lately, but I can't cross this one. But, sugar -- No, I've got two kids at home. I can't have a gun around them. So what are you going to do? I have no idea. But I'm gonna have to try and find this guy and call in a favor. Well... Simon's back now, Xander. We have to stop. Don't make this harder than it already is. I'll never give up on you, Cassandra. Put your hands on my wife again, and I'll kill you, brother. Simon! Does Simon ever wear clothes? No, thank God. Now, shh! You'd kill your own brother? If I had to. What?! Oh, my God. That's it. I'm switching sides. I-I'm team Xander now. Thank you. I mean, Simon -- you know, he was in a coma for over a year. Cassandra has every right to date his younger brother. At first, I thought, you know, a brother does not step on another brother's territory, coma or not. But look. And Xander is such a prince. Oh, a real prince. He's so special. - Knock-knock! - Hi. - Hey, you two. - Hey. Dale and I were just -- we were not watching anything. Hey. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. How you doing? All right? I'm good. Hi. Mwah! Hi, Lace. Kids made that for you. Hi. Aww. Little angels. Travis likes to draw animals. And Katie -- she's into clouds, so... It's perfect. I love it. Hey. Hey! How are you? Good. How you doing? I'm good. Welcome to the, uh, flower store. Honey, I'm gonna put these over here, okay? How you feeling, Lace? I am fine. I wish y'all would stop worrying about me. Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. Listen -- police are making progress, and, you know, we're -- Uh, excuse me -- I'm just gonna do a quick exam, if your friends wouldn't mind stepping aside for a second. Oh, sure. Uh, I'm gonna stay with my wife, if that's all right. Of course. Okay. Love you. I love you, too. Hey. You said that you guys made some progress. What did you find out? We're investigating what this guy could have possibly been looking for. Do you have anything out of the ordinary that someone might want to steal? Not that I can think of. And what about you? Anything I should know about? What exactly are you implying? Just that your past might be coming back to bite you in the ass. Hey, you know what, both of you? It's about Lacey. We're following every lead. I'll tell you the second I know anything. Look. I got to get to work. Can you pick up the kids from school? I never should have listened to Sandoval. What are you talking about? This has got to be Vandermeyer. Why else would someone try to break into the house? Kyle, this can't be about your testimony or the police would know about it. They -- they're following Vandermeyer 24/7. They can't watch all of his people. Vandermeyer has got reach. That doesn't make any sense. You're not even living at the house right now. And if he wanted to find you, he would find you. Look. I guess. Look -- all I know is that if I did something to put Lacey in the hospital, I'd never be able to forgive myself. They're gonna find this guy. It'll be okay. Just pick up the kids. Look at you working the accessories. Thanks. It's my favorite scarf. Yeah, well, something's got to keep that brain attached. Now that you mentioned it, I did wear it for a reason. Oh, my lord. Nikki's got a hickey. I haven't seen one of those since middle school. In my neck of the woods, we call them "love bites." Huh. Well, Nikki with the hickey... ...I didn't know, uh, you were seeing someone. Oh. I'm not. I was hoping we could date, but it just turned out to be a fun-buddy thing. You little slut. What did you call me? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, you heard me! You don't get to be fun buddies with a guy I fun-buddy. Damn it! I can't stop saying "fun buddy"! I didn't just want to be fun buddies. But even if I did, it's none of your business. Hey, hey, fun buddy's still in the room. Please stop! You tap that one more time, that'll be the last guy you ever tap, you hear me? Whoa! You can't tell me what to do. I will tap whoever I want to tap. Not if I have anything to do with it! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on! Hey, ladies, ladies, ladies! Hey, you both said no feelings were gonna get hurt! This looks like a lot of feelings! Hey! We have clients out there. This ain't over. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, ladies, this is way more than over. Now, I know that I have seemed distracted the last few days, but do not mistake that as me not knowing what's going on around here. You can sleep with her or you can sleep with her or the three of y'all can all go off and sleep together. I don't really care. But it is not gonna happen on my time. And it is certainly not gonna happen here at the Rub. Listen, Riley. I'm so sorry. No. Now, I'm not the fun police here, okay? I am the money police, and this little thing is keeping me from making money. Y'all understand that? Fine. All right. Yeah. Good! Now let's go make some people happy! Whoa. Okay, okay. And for the record, this has stopped being fun. Hey. How you feeling today? Great. I went out with Penny last night. Oh, yeah? How's the courtship going? Third date and she hasn't slammed the door in my face. She told me that I was the most respectful man she's ever dated. Wow. I think she might be the one. Well... Love is hard to come by, so if you find it, you got to grab ahold of it and hold on tight. Speaking of which -- Oh, uh, about that? From here on out, it's only legit massages for me. As amazing as you are -- and trust me, you got the best hands on this side of the border -- You only want to share that with Penny. She's my dream girl. Is that crazy? No. Not one little bit. Roll over. Oh, my God. That's so good. Yeah? Don't stop. Okay. At some point, I do have to stop. Oh, no, don't stop. That feels so good right there. Okay, my hands are... Am I interrupting? Hey! Oh, hey. No. Come on in. Oh, those are pretty. Thanks. Uh, you know what? I'm gonna take a break. You want any, uh, coffee? No, thank you. But you know I love you. I love you more. You always have to win, don't you? Bye. Hey. Hey. I would have come sooner, but I was dropping Twinkle off at her dad's. Well, no. I'm glad you're here. Well, aren't these just beautiful? Aren't they? Riley brought those by. Bless her heart. They are just so sweet. Much better. Hey! Hey. Oh. Hi, Taylor. Hi. It's a girls' night out. You bring the margaritas? Oh, my God -- hey, I hope that Inez is still not sitting underneath that dryer. Oh, honey. She's gonna learn to love that color. Oh. Ow. Oh, my God. Are you okay? Aah! Oh, my God! Oh! Something's wrong. Oh, my God! Hold on! Just breathe. Oh, God. Hey, excuse me! We're gonna need a doctor in here! Aah! Something's wrong! I'm right here. I'm right here. Ooh! Ow! Doctor, the baby's showing signs of distress. It could be placenta abruptio. Ow! Ow! It's gonna be okay. What's going on?! Get them out of here now! Lacey! I'm her husband. Ooh. All right, Lacey. We got it. What happened? Please just let him stay. Lacey! Lacey! Hey. I'm so sorry about the baby. I'll give y'all some privacy. Thank you. I am so sorry this is happening. Come here. It's okay. She's gonna be okay, right? She'll be okay. You can see her now. You got to be brave, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Come on. The sedation should wear off shortly. She is going to be fine. Thank you. You hear that, Wonder Woman? You're gonna be just fine. Dale. Yeah, sweetie, I'm right here. The baby. I'm gonna try real hard. And when we're ready, we're gonna try again. No. Come here. We're right here, and we love you. She... She didn't even have a name. Lacey, I promise you, no matter what I have to do or how long it takes me... I'm gonna make this right. Hey! Why haven't you found this guy yet? Calm down. No. It's been three days. He could be halfway to California. Hey, could you take it down a notch? Lacey just lost her baby because of this son of a bitch. She what? I-I didn't even know she -- Yeah, well, now you do, so please don't tell me to calm down. All right. Come here. We cross-referenced the license-plate info with all the Caddys in the county, and we came up with three possible suspects. Now, none of them are at their last known address, but one of them matches Lacey's description. This has got to be the guy. This is who we're trying to find. Yeah, when are you gonna stop trying to find him, Evan, and just go and get him? We have to follow protocol. Excuse me. Evan. Screw your protocol. Okay? Look, that is the guy. He's got a scar on his cheek. Now go and get him. I am on top of this. Evan! The watch commander wants us in his office now. Trust me. Sean Foster. Ever heard of him? I can't say that I have. Why? He's the guy that attacked Lacey, and the police can't find him. Never thought I'd be saying this, but now is the time that you should let the police do their job. Yeah, but they're not doing their job, Georgia. That's... That's the problem. Look, I hate to ask, but I just... I want to be able to tell them where he is so that they can go and take him in. Well, I can't make you any promises, but I'm gonna do some digging. Thank you. Hey. I promise you that if he was after the client list, I'm gonna take the fall, okay? Nobody else is getting hurt because of me. Client list? What client list? I never heard of a client list. And as far as I'm concerned, this Foster's just some lowlife trying to make up a story. Do I have to do your job for you? Fix it! If you ever come near my home and my family again, I will snap your neck. I don't know what you're talking about, Parks. Oh, like hell you don't. You broke into my house. Don't play games, Kyle. If I'd have wanted to mess with you, I'd have made a phone call. And if I wanted you dead, trust me -- you wouldn't have woken up this morning. You think I'm scared of you, Vandermeyer? If anybody should be scared, it's you. Always a pleasure chatting with you, Kyle. I'll see you in court. Officer Parks. Hey. Evan, it's me, Riley. Listen, I am at, uh... 4835 Kling Street. What's going on? Sean Foster, the guy that attacked Lacey -- I'm looking at him right now. Don't do anything stupid. Look, I am just gonna keep an eye on him until you guys get here and arrest him, okay? There is no way in hell this guy's getting away with this. Riley. Look, are you gonna help me or not? 4835 Kling. Just stay in your truck, all right? I'll get there as fast as I can. Riley's in trouble? Not yet, but we got to go. Oh, no.

Hey -- what I want to know is how you found out where Foster was. It's not for you to know, okay? I just got tired of waiting on you. Have you gone crazy? That guy is a criminal. You have a family, kids. You think I don't know that? I don't know what you're thinking! You could have gotten yourself killed. You know what I was thinking? Hurt the guy that hurt Lacey. Just promise me you will not pull a stunt like that again. It's my family, Evan. I'll do whatever I have to do. Evan. Thank you. Oh, my God. Thank God you're home. Evan told you what happened? Yes. He called me when I picked the kids up from school. Look, I know what I did was foolish. It was beyond foolish. Come on, Riley. What were you doing? You could have come to me. I'm your husband. It's my job to protect you. Okay, I'm sorry. I guess I've just gotten used to protecting myself. Look -- I'm not the same girl that I was when you left. B-but this was my problem to fix. I went and I saw Vandermeyer today. Y-you what? But he's not gonna be bothering us anymore, all right? Don't worry. No, of course I'm gonna worry, Kyle. I mean, come on -- if the police knew that you were even 10 yards from Vandermeyer -- and, by the way, how do you even know that he has something to do with this? Honestly, I don't. I don't, but I couldn't just sit here and do nothing. Kyle, look, I need you here... Okay? For the kids...for me. I mean, we worked so hard to get you out of there. Please don't throw that away. All right. All right, I get it. Is there anything else I can do for you now? Do you mind just staying on the sofa? Of course I will. I want to be here for you. Good night. Not now, Shelby. Evan, you're gonna have to talk to me. I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere. I've had it. I am done with Riley. What did she say to you back there? Nothing she hasn't said a million times before. I just can't believe it's taken me this long to get it. Don't beat yourself up. Riley's family. Family's gonna be tough. You don't understand. She doesn't respect me. Every time she's needed me, I've been there for her. But no more! You don't mean that. Yes, I do! I am tired of being her errand boy! You have every right to be upset. You're damn right I do! So, what do you want? I want you. Don't say that because you're mad at Riley. I've never been more sure about anything in my entire life. Oh, thank you so much. Now, you can just take that on back, please. Mm-hmm. Love the smell of this vanilla-bean coffee. Hey. Hey! I just wanted to come by and say thank you for helping me with Lacey, and we'd have never found Foster without you. By the way, how did you? Well, I made a call to a friend in the U.S. Marshal's office. Oh, they can take down anyone. You know, the local police -- sometimes they're just too prideful to admit they need help. Oh, you can say that again. I just never in my wildest dream expected you to go after Foster. I thought you were gonna give his address to the police. Well, I couldn't let him get away, especially with all this being my fault. This was not your fault. You hear me? I hear you. Having a hard time believing it. Well, just give it some time. Okay. Oh, sugar. Yep? Return that bridesmaid's dress. I've been rethinking the look of my wedding. Oh, Georgia, thank God! I mean... Why? 'Cause it was so pretty. You are a worse liar than I am. Well... You know, I was looking at all those big gowns, and I realize... That's what I did in my first wedding, and look how well that turned out. Ooh, true. No, I am wearing the dress I wore... the day I met Harold. He loves me for me, and I want my wedding day to be only about that -- love. That's nice. Okay, enough about you. What am I gonna wear? Well, a dress that makes you happy. You know, one that you'd wear forever, so it can remind you of the happiest day of my life. Oh, well, fancy. I love you. I love you, too. Okay, sweats and high heels -- that's what I'm gonna be wearing. What are you doing? Making money. Wait just a damn min-- you just sold my virginity purse? You use that word like it means something to you. Besides, I just made a $247 profit. Can you believe this?! Don't look at me. All right, give it. Give it. Come on. No! Ladies, hey, don't fight! Shh! Shh! Shh! Give it! Look! Wait! I'll buy it back, okay? You can't. Bidding's over. She stole my purse out from under me. Hmm. You know, this ain't right. And just to let y'all know, whoever gets that purse has got some bad karma coming to them, okay? If you say so. Hope your mom enjoys her purse. Oh. Well, thanks for taking her side. Hey, I got you a little something. What about your mama? What Nikki don't know won't kill her. Really? Mm-hmm. You know, that thing I said about karma, well... I take it back. Oh, heavenly father... I know I've strayed, but everything I've done... Has been to protect my family. Tell me what to do. I'm so torn. Hi. You guys feel like a visitor? Always. Yeah, of course. Hey, you know what? This is a good time for me to go home... And take a shower and get out of these clothes, okay? Oh, please do. You smell rank. Oh, wow. You are the charmer. Hey. We're Locklins, all right? You are my number-one girl, for better, for worse. Always have been, always will be. Oh, my God, I love him. I know. Me too. Here. Okay. So, tell me the truth. How are you feeling? Not good. That's what I thought. That's why I'm here. Did you really go all Rambo on that guy for me? Oh, yeah, you know. Anything for my sister. That's kind of awesome. Really dumb. You pull that crap again, I will whup your ass. You know I can. Well... Oh, my God! Is this "Brothers and Lovers?" Oh, yeah. Oh, turn it up. Dearest father, I need your guidance. Is it wrong that I love both brothers? Been there, done that. Mm-hmm. Okay. Tell me what to do. Cassandra. Xander. I love you more than life itself. God, this is so bad yet so good. Simon will kill you. Yep. Mm. I want to see how they end it. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
