I've been calling you all day. I'm worried. You are mixed up with some dangerous people. Okay, you know what? I trusted the wrong girl, okay, And I got screwed over, so I had to fire her today, And then I got pissed. Okay, it's business! I am fine! If you are in some kind of trouble, you need to tell us.

No way. Everything's fine. I was just, um... I was just wondering if you wanted me to start That morning meeting without you. (sighs) oh, god, I should have called you. I'm sorry. I'm gonna be late. Yeah, it's no problem. You got a lot on your plate. Hey, you... (tap) Good morning. You got any ideas how you're getting That missing thing back? I'm working on it. Just cover for me, okay? Yeah, whatever I can do to help. And look. It's all of our necks on the line here, okay? Yeah. (cell phone beeps) All right, people, it's time for the morning meeting, So, uh, let's gather 'round. Oh, hold up. Where's riley? Well, that's none of your business, mister. Well, take a seat. Go on. Okay, guys, riley's put me in charge. And until she comes back, You will all refer to me as "ms. Ramos." (laughs) come on. That's not gonna happen. Hey, one more laugh out of you, girly man, And you will be on bathroom detail, And it ain't pretty in there. (chuckles) all right? Hey! Zip it up. (snaps fingers) (snaps fingers) focus. (pounding on door) Riley! We need to talk. Look. I don't trust you, okay? I'm never gonna trust you again. But if you want to know how you can make this right, I'm gonna tell you how to start. If I could take this all back, I would. You betrayed me, and if you ever do it again, You're never gonna live it down, you got me? I'll do anything to fix this. Damn straight you will. (knock on glass) Is there somewhere I can talk to you privately? Look. I'm kind of in the middle of something here so... I need to find out what's going on with riley. Look, you're the last person that I want to come to for help, Especially when it involves my wife, But I'm worried about her, all right? And I don't know what to do. (door closes) So, how bad is it? What exactly do you know? Nothing specific. Has riley told you anything? Oh, come on, man. You saw her last night. Every time I try to talk to her, she just shuts me out, Saying something about how she's just gonna handle it all on her own. Well, maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe it's just business. You know, she is a tough woman. Oh, come on. Don't give me that. You're my brother. I can tell when you're hiding something from me. Look, you and I, we've had our problems. All right, but if riley's in danger, We need to put all that aside and help her out. I'll keep my eye on her, but she doesn't tell me squat. If she's gonna talk to anyone, it's gonna be you. Yeah. How do I get her to talk to me? By trusting her. Letting her know you're gonna be there for her, No matter what. Same way she was there for you. Yeah. He's here. (sighs) good. I talked to nikki. It's on. He started on his scotch early. Really? It's not even noon. Does it matter? This time tomorrow, we'll all be in jail. We're not going anywhere. Now, you get ahold of yourself. Get... We've got 24 hours before carlyle makes good On his threat to reveal that list, which means... Yeah, which means I have 24 hours to get the client list, Or we're all destroyed. Oh, not just us, darling. Everyone you've ever cared about, Everyone who's even touched by that list. When a bomb like this explodes, There's no controlling who gets hurt. That's never gonna happen. Ah! I'm cutting you off. If we're getting out of this, we need you sharp. Please just delay the task force as long as possible. I'll do what I can. Ladies. (sighs) okay. I've got a plan to get us out of this. Now, besides what's in my office, Are there any other papers pertaining to the list that I don't know about? No, everything was in the file cabinet. What we need to do is get rid of any incriminating evidence, Not just the list. Exactly, which is why I shredded all the financials. Well, you can shred till the cows come home. Do you have an exit strategy? The rub's insurance policy? Just keep it here in the safe, okay? Look, if all goes as planned, We're gonna be able to walk out of this thing with our hands clean. (sighs) Hey. Sorry. I've been swamped with this task force. No problem. Can't really talk about it. We've got a big interrogation coming in. One of the girls we've been watching decided to flip on carlyle. What's with the packing? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I got called to detectives. Found out yesterday. That's great! So you and me... We're no longer partners. Well, at least not on the job. What division? Internal affairs. Wow. That can get pretty intense. That's what I heard. I'm cool with it. The law has to come first. You covering for riley when she found foster, that's safe with me. But from this point, I can't protect you. Shelby... You're a great cop, evan. Don't screw it up. I'm here to see detective monroe. (sighs) Michelle, I told you to get calla lilies, Not whatever the hell these are. I'm sorry, ms. Ramos. Mike wetanson just canceled his appointment. (scoffs) what's his excuse? Yesterday's storm. It messed up everybody's schedules. (sighs) fine. Usually I charge for same-day cancellations, But I suppose an act of god earns you a pass. Derek, sweetie, be a doll and get me a cup of coffee. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Hey. Can I talk to you for a second? (sighs) What? How great was it waking up next to each other this morning? You slipping into bed last night... Look, look, look. Now's not really the time. People might hear us. So? Let them. Look, I want to start every day like that. (scoffs) see? This is what I was afraid of. You give me your key for one night, Next thing I know, you're talking about me moving in. Will you cool your jets? All I'm saying is that my morning would... Uh! Would be better with you around. Fine. But I just want to be clear with you. It's one thing to give me your key. It's another thing to ask me to give up my whole life. I'm not asking you to give your life. I'm asking you to let me be a part of it. (amelie speaking french) Amelie! Amelie! Please, calm down. (speaks french) Bonjour. (speaking french) I could learn. Uh, michelle, I'll take it from here. Hi! How can I help you? (clears throat) selena, they're french, not deaf. (scoffs) okay, I am sorry. My english is not so good. But we missed our flight yesterday because of the storm. And my girlfriend and I, we are very exhausted. We would like to relax. Are you open for a massage? Oh, yeah. You're just in luck. We, uh... We have a few openings, right? Uh, I'll be happy to take care of you and, uh... I have just the therapist for your lovely girlfriend. Michelle. (speaking french) Uh, actually, derek is all booked up for the day, so... Actually, no. I'm pretty wide-open, so... Can you just give us a sec? Just one sec. Come here! What? Just let michelle take this one. She doesn't even have her massage license yet. So? What marie-antoinette doesn't know won't kill her. Uh-uh, what's going on here? What? I'm just trying to be a good boss. Oh, don't begrudge me for trying to be a mentor To an aspiring massage therapist. Plus, riley told us that we need to be careful. You don't want me taking the hot client. Oh, please. Who are you talking to? Someone who enjoyed waking up next to me, Just as much as I enjoyed waking up next to her. He's all yours! Yes, she is. Bonjour. (speaks french) Come on. Right this way. I know I should have said something before. I was just so scared. It's good that you're here now. Monroe: So, where is carlyle trafficking in his girls from? Eastern europe, thailand... All over. How does it work? The girls come in shipping containers Through the port at galveston and go straight to the violet orchid. In fact, there's a shipment scheduled for tonight. We have to intercept tonight's galveston shipment. Well, since carlyle's girls are sent to the violet orchid, I'll approve a raid on that establishment, but none of the others. This investigation has to be airtight. But our surveillance cameras... Are still good for all of carlyle's clubs. But the first raid has to be where the girls come in from the port, And that's the violet orchid. Understood. Keep an eye on wild nights. If the raid on the violet orchid goes bad, Carlyle might react fast. Yes, sir. How do we trust you? You lied to us once. I'm telling you the truth, I swear. I know I've made some mistakes, But I'm trying to set things right. (woman singing in french) (knock on door) Okay, if you're... Oh! Comfortable... (laughs) I guess I came in too soon. (laughs) So, what can I work on today? (speaking french) Uh... Oh, you want me to work on your hands. Got it. In my line of work, Hands and forearms can get really tight. (speaking french) Yes, the weather has been really crazy lately, hasn't it? I know. That storm was a real doozy. (speaking french) Can you tell me specifically What you'd like me to work on next? Oh. There are certain benefits in having your flight canceled. Your hands are quite special. Oh, you do this as long as I have, And you pick up a trick or two. Mmm, I would love to learn What tricks you have up your sleeve. Well, let's just say david copperfield Has nothing on me when it comes to rubdowns. Who? Never mind. So, you're from France, huh? Mmm. Furthest I've ever been is new orleans. Most of that trip's still hazy. You would love paris. Ah, mon dieu, you should see the world. Hmm, right. Right after I win the lottery. Turn over. I'll buy you a ticket. Show you my country. Sure. Mmm-hmm. And your girlfriend and I could be roommates, right? Don't worry about amelie. She and I are more Like travel companions with certain... How do you say... Benefits? (chuckles) good luck with that. Before you know it, she's gonna start changing the rules on you. First it's a key. Then she's gonna want to start playing house. I highly doubt that. Right now, she's probably seducing your handsome friend. Really? And that, uh... Doesn't bother you? Of course not. Monogamy... It doesn't make sense to me. It's impossible for two people to be faithful to each other. You really believe that? This how the way the world works. Men and women, We should live our lives the way we want to. Not how others want us to. I like the way you think. (moans) (door opens) Hey. Hi. You seen her yet? Not yet. I got linette's call and came straight over. Did she say why she needed to see us so badly? No, just that it was important And she needed to do it face-to-face. Linette: Let me see that baby. (gasps) are you not the cutest little chick That ever was hatched? You must be cole. I'm your auntie linette. Mama. I am so happy for you and dale. Thanks, linette. You deserve everything that's wonderful. Okay, so, when you called, You said that it was important. Everything okay? Better than okay. Everything's great. Well, that's good, 'cause you had us worried. Yeah... So, what was so urgent? You two girls Are the most important people in the world to me. I could have never gotten healthy without you. Well, we love you, mama. I know... That's why it's so hard To give you my good news. Good news? Do you remember my friend charlene down in austin? Well, now that I'm getting out of here, She wants me to open a salon with her, And we're gonna do it our way. We're gonna be our own bosses. Wow. Mama, that's... That's great, but what about your life here and your family? I'll visit all the time. Now that you've got kyle back, You don't need me around like you did last year. Mama, I always need you, now more than ever. Are you sure this is what you want? I'm sure. I need to feel useful. And I wanted to tell you two face-to-face. We understand. The most important part of being sober And living a healthy life Is being honest with the ones you love. (exhales sharply) (sighs) That's pretty incredible about linette, right? Yeah, I'm glad she's gonna be okay. I wish she had insurance. Okay, you were being weird in there. Is this about the list being stolen, Or is something else going on? I don't know what you're talking about. Do not tell me you don't know what I'm talking about. First, you tell me you want me to take care Of kyle and the kids if anything happens to you. And then you tell linette That you're gonna need her now more than ever. Spill it. Look... I can't be cole's godmother, okay? What? Why on earth would you say that? I don't wanna go into it. It's just... It's dangerous for me to be around you and your baby right now. Dangerous? I'm gonna fix it, okay? But until then, I need to keep my distance. No, riley, not good enough. You need to tell me what is going on. Look. Whatever it is, we can work it out together. Your attack was because of me. I might be the reason that you lost your baby. No, that's not possible. It was a burglar. He didn't even know that I was there. He was looking for the client list. Oh, my god. Lacey... And you knew about this all this time and you didn't Say anything to me? No, I didn't know the whole time. Lacey, will you please just look at me? I stood by you for everything. I can't even look at you. Lacey. Just go. Okay, are you sure that carlyle Has the client list at wild nights? 100%. Anything he really values... His guns, his cash... He keeps in his office safe. You're not playing us again, are you, daisy duke? No, I'm not. Because if you are, you are gonna rue the day you set your foot in the rub 'cause I will... Georgia, you're not helping. Okay, we need to stay on the same team. Okay, for now. Okay, great. Now, look, everything that we've planned so far is working. Overton said that they are gonna search the violet orchid, Which means you should be able to get carlyle Out of wild nights, right? I can get him out. Okay, you need to do that by 5:00, 'cause that's when They're gonna be "auditioning" the new girls. Now, one more thing... When people start asking you questions, Carlyle went to the rub after you saw him today. Okay. Okay. Okay? Now, how are we doing on your end? I'm good. I just need to know when to call. Remember that their names are tatianna, Valeria, and irina. Oh, and you're gonna need this. It's the code to carlyle's safe. Only him and buddy know it. Buddy? Carlyle's club manager. Nikki, this combo better get me in there. It should. The safe is right behind the desk. You can't miss it. That's got to be where he's keeping the list. Okay, then, ladies, I guess I have an audition. Riley. Be careful. Leave me alone! I'm not done with you! Nikki, no. You have no idea what he is capable of. You're so sweet when you want to be. Thank you for a wonderful day. Oh, it's my pleasure. And if you're ever in texas, you know where to visit. I do, and when you're in paris... I know who to call. I truly hope so. Well, bon voyage. (chuckles) My darling, shall we go? (speaking french) (laughs) nice couple. Yeah, real nice. Good massage? Real good. Mmm. Professional. Same here. By the book. Okay, we got trouble, people. The exterminator's on his way. I need everybody cleared out of here... Right now. Derek: What is going on? Go! Uh... Okay. Termites. Well, that's what's been eating all my money. She don't have to tell me twice. I'm sure there's a sale out there somewhere. Hey, what do you say we hop on our bikes And go for a sunset ride? There's this trail I want to show you. (sighs) You know, being boss today really wore me out. You cool if I take it easy tonight... Solo? Yeah, sure. It's cool. Yeah? Okay. Actually, it's not cool. What? Ever since I gave you my key, You've been acting all distant around me. (laughs) will you give it a rest? No. You're trying to push me away, selena. And I'm not gonna let you. Oh, you're not gonna let me? Get real, derek. Does this have anything to do With riley getting sick yesterday, With her kicking nikki out of the rub? Look, I... I don't... I don't know what you're talking about. Like hell you don't. (sighs) Hey, if there's trouble, you got to tell me. But there's no trouble. Riley's got everything under control. What are you hiding? I am not hiding anything. Look, I'm gonna be honest with you. I want to give us a shot. But if there's any chance in us working out, You got to be honest with me. Hey! You want honesty, hmm? Here. What's this? My tips. What? From the week? From today. You gave extras to that french guy? He's not even on the list, and riley told us to be careful. Look, riley put me in charge, And I made an executive decision. Don't tell me you didn't visit The south of France with that supermodel. I know you too well. I didn't. (laughs) oh, well, then why not? A, she's not on the list, And, b, I'd rather spend my off-hours with you. (scoffs) whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Just because we are dating Does not mean that we're not gonna give extras anymore. I never said that. You keep jumping to conclusions. Okay, then what are you trying to say? All I'm saying is we get each other, okay? I like having you in my life, And I want to keep having you in my life, Even when we stop working at the rub. Are you telling me that I need to quit? There is no winning with you. You say you get me? Then you should know that I don't trust guys, okay? Not even you, as much as I want to. I'm not gonna hurt you, selena. That's what my ex-husband said. "I love you for you. Don't ever change." And then we move in together, and he bangs the neighbor. (voice breaking) look, why did you have to Go and change things? All I did was give you my key, okay? If you're not ready for that... It doesn't matter. It's still changed. You know what? (sniffles) I think you should take this back. I want to be with you, selena. But this is one decision you can't undo. Who says I want to? You were right, greg. I want it all, and I want it with you. Why would I trust you now? Because I love you, And you have no idea what riley's planning to do to you. I'm listening. I have information that can stop her. It's better than the list. Why don't you come down to the club? We're auditioning new girls. There's no way I'm going anywhere near wild nights. Please, just come over. I need you. And I want to show you how sorry I am... In private. I'll see you soon, nik.

Well, if it was some lady, then it wasn't our dude. Well, how was I supposed to know? I was auditioning this girl in your office, And I got pulled out on an emergency call. You left a girl alone in my office? Well, yeah, but... Nothing's gone. Check the safe. She got the list and your gun. Boss, I'm sorry. (cell phone beeps) Everything okay, baby? No, baby.

Of course. Of course. We'll be right there. (cell phone beeps) What was that? I thought you said things were broken between you and riley. Dale, I say a lot of things. You don't have to pay attention to all of them. Okay. Does that mean I have the permission to ignore you? Shh. Look, I am very angry with my best friend. Mmm-hmm. It doesn't mean we're not best friends, okay? Mmm-hmm. Oh, was I supposed to hear that, or was I supposed to ignore it? I'm just trying to keep things straight. (crying continues) I'll just drive. Just driving miss crazy. Hey, georgia, it's me, okay. I made it out of wild nights. I got the client list. Everything's under control. And as far as that exit strategy we were talking about, Don't you worry. Greg carlyle is gonna be history. And you and I, our futures will be insured. Okay. Bye. (silenced gunshot) (gasps) Hand over the list, mrs. Parks. I don't want to hurt you. Oh, yeah? Just like you didn't mean to hurt my best friend, huh? Just like you didn't mean to threaten nikki so she'd spy on me? (groans) nikki was a sweet girl. But she was in way over her head. Not you. You know exactly what you're doing. You got balls! (screams) (grunts) (panting) Okay, look. I'm just a mom, okay, with two kids. And I got in all this, and I don't know how to get out. But none of this was ever supposed to happen. Just give me the list, mrs. Parks, Or you and everyone you love are going down. No, you see, that is never, ever gonna happen. No! (screaming) (grunts) (groans) (tires screeching) Riley!
