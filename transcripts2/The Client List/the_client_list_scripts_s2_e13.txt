 The Client List (2012–2013): Season 2, Episode 13 - Whatever It Takes - full transcript 
 Before Evan and Trimble transfer, by way of promotion, to the Texas Rangers organized crime task force, not Evan's lover Shelby, they are security-detailed to the country club where Riley volunteered the Rub staff for an Army veterans benefit. While Dashiell Codd, who wants her for any trio, enjoys the event excessively, she's horrified to learn from old client Judge Overton about the task force being aimed at massage parlor prostitution too; Kyle, tricked by rascal Travis to allow his kids team spending the afternoon after the match at home, enlists help from Dale and Lacey, who plan to adopt. Although rival Greg Carlyle fires his undercover for failing to get him the Rub's client list, Riley finds it gone after a break-in at her office, where it wasn't.

 Previously on The Client List... Have you ever heard of sploshing? Hello, Judge Overton. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep them away from her. Oh, my God. You understand? No! Hey! His name is Greg Carlyle. He owns Wild Nights. That place is very dangerous. You two rookies ready for a little undercover work? What's the assignment, Lieutenant? Prostitution. Massage parlor.

 And you two pretty boys are bait. It's not my neck that's stiff. Um... Beaumont police. You are under arrest. Greg Carlyle owns the Lucky Lotus? You give me that list or you're gonna get back on the pole. The client list holds a lot of power. Make sure it's good and hidden. Someone broke into my house. What am I gonna do? And the client list is safe, isn't it? Yeah, it's safe. I've been real careful. But do you think it was Carlyle? I want you to come home. Undercover officers arrested several women

 under suspicion of prostitution. Saying this is part of a larger investigation scheduled to ramp up across the state. So? Is that everything? Yep. That's it. I'm home. Well... Welcome home. God, I missed this. And this. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. Kyle? Too soon? Yeah, too soon. Okay. You're right. We don't have to rush anything. Mom! Travis. Mom. Hey, buddy. You're supposed to knock. I know, but the Broncos have practice, and I can't find my football jersey. It's okay. Yeah. It's okay. Come on. Let's go find that jersey. ♪ The Client List 2x13 ♪ Whatever It Takes Original Air Date on June 9, 2013 == sync, corrected by elderman == All right, Henry. You all set? Let's get you tacked up and ready to -- Ready to ride? I got him all saddled up and everything. What are you doing here? Came by to see my buddy Henry. And you, of course, since you ran out of my place last night like a bat out of hell. Well, I can't help it. I'm a busy girl. That's why I came by. You're telling me that you had nothing better to do this morning than to come by here and hang out with my horse? Well, there are a few things that come to mind. Stop! We're not alone. Come on. Oh, I don't think he minds. Look, Derek. You and me, we're like vampires -- true creatures of the night. That's when we really click. But I'm not a vampire. And this isn't "Twilight." I'm just a normal guy who likes to do normal things, like wake up next to you in my bed, have breakfast together. Well, I don't do breakfast. Fine. How about a movie? All right, fine. We'll do a movie. But just a movie. Mm-hmm. Doesn't include breakfast in bed. And I get to pick. Of course you do. Don't you worry, my little vampire. We'll make it a late show. So long, Henry. Get out of here. You know what -- I think that the clothing monster is holding this jersey hostage. Mom... is it okay if the team sleeps over Saturday after the game? I thought that Ben's mother was hosting that sleepover. But she got the flu. Yeah, well, I have to work, and you know that my busiest days are Saturdays. Please? Pretty please? I'm gonna think about it. Come on! I know what that means! Yeah, it means I'm gonna think about it! - No, it doesn't! - Riley! It means "no" again! Riley! Kids' room! Aha! What is the point of you having a cellphone if you don't answer it? Oh, I'm sorry. Good morning. Hi. How are you? You're not gonna believe this. I can't even believe it. Wait. Lacey, what is going on? There's a baby! I mean, there could be a baby. What?! We could be having a baby. Are you pregnant?! Why do I keep saying "baby"? How can that be? No, I'm -- I'm not. Pregnant, I mean. I mean... after everything that happened, Dale and I decided to look into adoption. You didn't say anything. We barely filled out the paperwork, and next thing I know, they're calling us saying that there's a birth mother that wants to meet us. But first, we have to pass the home inspection in two days. Can you believe it? God, Lacey, that is incredible! I know, but we have to baby-proof the house, and I don't even know where to start. I've got tons of stuff in the garage. You don't mind if we use it? I would do anything for my future niece or nephew. Aww. So, Dale and I can come by later and pick it up? Yes, I'll have Kyle get it all together for you. Oh, my God, Riley. I feel like I'm dreaming. Oh, is this real? Somebody pinch me. Ow! That hurt! Sorry. You said pinch you. But this is really happening, isn't it? It is! Oh, my God. No. No scary movies. If I wanted to watch two hours of torture, I'd have dinner with my mother. Hey, you two. Oh, it's okay. We all know you're a couple. Didn't know you had it in you. We're just... having fun. Exactly. Just tons of fun. Well, I'm really glad you guys cleared that up for me. Okay, everybody. Let's pay attention, please. Now, tomorrow, we are gonna close up shop and we are heading to River Knolls for a golf tournament. Michelle, this is gonna be a great time for you to get your hours in for your license. Uh, I got my hours, so am I off the hook? Not a chance. What -- Why in the world are we doing this? Because Georgia's husband needs our help. He lost his sponsor, and I said we'd do it. Now, we are gonna do chair massages for all the golfers and the attendees. Who the heck would want to golf there? It's a terrible design. You lose half your balls on the ninth hole. What? I golf. It's for a great cause, okay? All the proceeds are gonna be benefiting soldiers who are coming home from war. I'm in. Me too. That's the spirit. See you guys at 8:00. Riley! Wait! Wait! Riley! I can't believe you're asking me to do this. - Not asking. - I'm telling. Well, I'm gonna lose a bucket of money. I don't care. I want all hands on deck. Oh. Fine. Then I guess these hands better get to work, then. All right. Listen up. Officer Parks and Officer Trimble, this is a great honor -- one that should not be taken lightly. This Texas Rangers badge gives you jurisdiction all over the state of Texas. Your promotion to this task force proves that good work does not go unrecognized. Now get out there and kick ass. Born to kick ass, sir. Yes! But you'll be slumming with us for a few more days, and you and Trimble are working security tomorrow -- the River Knolls Golf Club. Dismissed. We're on a friggin' task force! This is gonna be epic. Hey, two-for-one shots at the Lonestar Tavern. You coming? I'm good. Okay, more ladies for me, then. He gets douchier by the day. That douche gets punched in the face and still gets promoted. Total B.S. You're the best cop in this squad. You know this is wrong. It'll be fine. Oh, I'm sorry. Damn allergies. Can we skip to the main course? How about we start with an appetizer? Oh. What'd you have in mind? Well, you know you're amazing, right? Sniffles and all? And I cannot stop thinking about more than one of you. Okay, well, that's gonna be tricky, 'cause my cloning machine is in the shop. I guess I just got to spit it out. What I would love is you... and two other girls. I have, uh, heard of thinking outside the box... Come on. It'll be fun. The other two can just watch. Or...join in. You know, whatever works for you. All right, that sounds... Interesting. Um, you know what? Let me check the schedules and talk to the girls about it, and we'll see if we can't... Work something out for next time. I'm getting excited just thinking about it. Yes, I can certainly see that you are. So, shall we seize the moment? Carpe diem away. Okay. Vroo-- boom! Buddy, I told your mom that we were gonna clean up this mess. Do I have to? Oh, I'm afraid so. Okay. Hey, Dad. Yeah? Is it okay if the team sleeps over tomorrow after the game? The whole team? That's a lot of kids. I know, but nobody else can do it, and I told them that my dad was back, and they want you to show us some plays. Oh, you did, did you? You're good. So that's a "yes"? What'd your mom say? She said to ask you. If it's all right with her... ...I guess it's all right with me, too. Yes! We're gonna have the best sleepover the Beaumont Broncos ever had. But first, I need you to clean up that mess, boy. Thanks, Dad. Sorry I'm running late. I promise I'll make it up to you. Or...maybe I'm early, 'cause that's not your birthday suit. What's wrong? I don't want you getting all riled up. But just do me a favor? Don't take any new business for a while. You mean no new clients on the list? What's going on? Nothing I can talk about right now. I wish I could. No, you don't understand. I have a family -- people that really depend on me. If something is going on -- Nothing going on. Everything's just fine. Just -- just be careful. I always am. I'm just erring on the side of caution. Now, you know I never come here empty-handed. Uh...I can't. Unh. I won't take "no" for an answer. Then I guess I can't say "no." All right, look, you're not a new client. And you have 49 minutes left, so... let's make it count. I insist. You can walk all over me any day of the week. Massages? By the Rub of Sugar Land? Really? Riley, what are you thinking? Good to see you, too. You do know why I'm selling you the spa? So Harold doesn't find out. Exactly -- to keep what we do away from Harold, not to -- no pun intended -- rub it in his face. Harold was in a bind. Honey, there are just too many variables here -- the clients, the girls, the great outdoors! The tournament is on the up-and-up. Okay? There's no need to operate in the shadows. That is the only way to operate -- keep a low profile, stay out of the spotlight. That's the way you did things. Wait a minute. What's going on here? It's Kyle, isn't it? He's back, and you're thinking -- I'm not thinking anything. Oh, honey, I'm no fool. You would not be giving up client list revenue to massage a bunch of sweaty golfers for no reason. Are you thinking about going legit? Kyle and I are good. Real good. And I started doing this to take care of my family. And... If it's back together, are you thinking about getting out? I just want a backup plan. Well. I love "happily ever after." I'm gonna trust you on this one. But you have got to be on high alert. We'll watch everyone, Georgia, okay? You have my word. Mm-hmm. Besides, after all we've been through, we need a little fun. What's this? I missed you. We're not really gonna do all this, are we? Do what? Oh, you know... Couple stuff. Acting all lovey-dovey, nicknames, PDSs, Valentine's Day flowers -- all that crap. Do I look like that kind of guy? No, which is good, 'cause I got to be honest -- it's not really my speed. Mine either. Mm. You want to know what my speed is? Come here. Riley's in the next room. Well, then, I guess you better be very, very quiet. ♪ You're gonna shoot me down ♪ ♪ You're gonna shoot, shoot ♪ ♪ You're gonna shoot me down ♪ ♪ You're gonna shoot, shoot ♪ ♪ You're gonna shoot me down ♪ ♪ Shoot me down ♪ Kyle? Travis? Katie? Anybody? Look at me! I'm flying! Whoo-hoo! Whoa. Who are you, and what is that? Um, I'm just leaving, and that is hours upon hours of parenting-free entertainment. Yeah, okay, my husband did not consult me about this. Uh, sorry, ma'am. Kyle! Why is there a giant, expensive trampoline in our backyard? Don't worry. It's not costing anything. A friend lent it for the weekend. I thought it'd be a good idea tomorrow for the kids. What kids? For Travis' football team. The sleepover. The sleepover? I said we weren't hosting. Travis, did you lie about that? Kinda. Okay, Travis, go wash up for dinner. Hey. You and I are gonna talk about this later. What the hell were you thinking? Hey. Whoa. No, don't "whoa" me. I've had a very long week, and I come home, and now I got to deal with these kids? Riley, I asked Travis about it. He said that you approved it. I told him I would think about it. I'm helping Harold with his fundraiser. What a little con man. Look, it's fine. W-we'll just -- we'll cancel it. Oh, so that I can look like the bad guy? No, I don't think so. You can't do that, Kyle. You can't just come in here and start making executive decisions. Riley, it's a sleepover. I didn't tell him he could run off and join the Army. You find this real funny. You know what? I have been taking care of things around here on my own and doing a damn good job. And I know that. If I'm gonna be home, I should have a say in the decisions that get made around here, too. Fine, but I can still be pissed at you for not consulting me first. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hello. Hey. Whoa. Uh, we'll just -- we'll come back. No, no. Please, please come in. Maybe you can talk some sense into her before she sends me off to the firing squad for agreeing to host a sleepover. You know what would be a great idea, is if you guys could tell Kyle, 'cause he doesn't know, how hard it is to wrangle a bunch of 8-year-olds. Okay, well, I'll tell you what I think. No, sweetie, she doesn't want to know what you think. You sure? Yeah. I think that you two should just kiss and make up. It's not a big deal. You know what? Dale and I will help Kyle with the sleepover. Yeah. What she said. I thought you guys were getting ready for your home visit. We just have to install some locks and put together some baby furniture. I mean, we should be good to go, right? Yeah, it'll be fine. All systems go. You know what? I appreciate that. Very considerate. Come on, Dale. I got the baby stuff out back. You have to see this trampoline. Trampoline?! Okay! Whoa! Do you remember the trampolines... So, the honeymoon's over? The honeymoon never started. Wait -- Kyle's back, and you two haven't... No, Lace, we haven't. Wow. I want to. Look, we tried, and it got all hot and heavy, and then... Ugh. I just couldn't stop thinking about... Riley, he won't. You know that. My head knows that. My heart has some serious catching-up to do. Maybe it is just time for you to let go. Just a bit. Well, I can let go. What? You don't think I can let go? Yeah. Maybe it is just time to give Kyle a chance, too. Who put this together? Are you kidding me?! Yeah! Look at you! I can let go. That's the real deal. A couple of kids on there... Best elite unit in the country, and we're on it. Isn't it something? It's something, all right. Hey, it's not a surprise. I mean, I've always excelled. In high school, I was a natural athlete. Seriously, Trimble? Do you not remember dodge ball? Trimble got picked last in dodge ball. And I was a straight-A student. Only because you sweet-talked the valedictorian into doing your homework. What can I say? Chicks dig me, and so do the Texas Rangers. Show some sensitivity. What? Shelby graduated top in our class. Evan, give it a rest. Shelby was part of that raid, just like us. Just because she's not some pretty boy they can use as bait doesn't mean she should be shut out. She doesn't need you standing up for her. She can handle herself just fine. Actually, Evan's right, if you think about it. It really sucks. No. That's not happening. Trimble's not feeling sorry for me -- ever. Yeah, Trimble. And you -- drop it. I mean it. Just drop it. I don't care what she says. It's bullshit. But it's not like you can do anything about it. Dude, really? A sneaker? A baby needs a sneaker? Like he's gonna wake up one morning and just go, "I'm going for a run." Come on. Dude, you got to help me out here. What? Travis is my son, too. All right, how long is she gonna keep making me pay for the past? You've been gone a while. You can't expect to just pick up where you left off. All right, I get that part, but come on. It's a sleepover. How hard could it be? That is true, and you survived jail. That was one hell of a sleepover, so this should be a cakewalk for you. Great. Thank you for that. But come on. It's not like I'll be doing it alone. You and Lacey -- Whoa. No, no, no, no, no. You will be doing this alone. Riley was right. You made your sleeping bag. You're gonna lie in it. Well, hold on. I thought you said you were on my side. You know what? Metaphorically speaking, I'm on your side. Hey, we have big things happening, Kyle. Lacey said that -- Lacey is not the boss of me. I wear the pants in this family. Come on, honey! Be quick! Why? Because we've got a lot to do, and I want to get back here early to help Kyle set up for the sleepover. All right. Chop-chop! Okay! All right, fine. I got to go, dude. Yeah, I s-- yeah. Coming!

Well, after the 20th call, I realized that you weren't gonna quit. I am persistent when something matters. Mm. I thought you were mad at me. Oh, no. I owe you an apology for last time. I have been under... Ss much pressure lately, Nikki. And I had forgotten what is important. That is, you and me. Wow. I want to take you to dinner tonight, and then tomorrow, we will spend all day in bed together. Mm. Tomorrow, I can't. I have school, and then I'm at the Rub. But tonight, I am all yours. I'll take what I can get. Nikki. You're still looking for the client list for me, right? Of course I am, baby. Good girl.

Right on time. Well, I'm here, ain't I? That's true. Mm. How about her? Four hands are better than two, huh? Mr. Codd and I need to have a little chat. Go ahead -- take care of that business we talked about earlier. Hey! What the hell are you thinking?! Georgia, I was -- Don't interrupt me! Now, you are acting like a damn fool! Do I need to remind you of the rules? Because if I do, then you can just kiss your membership goodbye. Need a relaxing massage? Hell, I don't know. Oh, look. No time to relax. Well, if you need anything... Thanks. Speak of the devil. I was just telling Evan how you saved the day. Oh, I don't know about that, but we're real happy to be here. You on duty? A bunch of us are working security. Yeah, and we're grateful. Well, you won't hear me complaining. It's a beautiful day and great cause. You two coming by the bar later? I'm sure Georgia's gonna insist upon it. She knows how to get her way, right? Yes, she does. All right. I'll, uh, I'll see you guys later. All right. Well, you look great. Thanks. So do you. No, I'm serious. You're practically glowing. Oh, well, you know -- new moisturizer. Things are -- are real good. Kyle back at your place? He is. Yeah, kids couldn't be happier. That's great. I mean, for them. Yeah, and you and Shelby, are you guys -- Oh, yeah, Shelby's -- everything's really -- Evan Parks, congratulations are in order. That's quite a promotion you got yourself. Thank you. Riley, this is Judge Overton. Judge Overton, this is my sister-in-law, Riley Parks. "Riley," is it? It is. It is. Hi. Very nice meeting you. So, Evan, a promotion? That is so exciting. Yeah. It really is. Texas Rangers green-lit a new task force. Picked me to be part of an elite undercover unit. Wow -- undercover. What are you gonna be doing? Well, if I told you, I'd have to kill you. Ohh. Let's just say it's organized crime, and I'm gonna be in the middle of all of it -- drugs, trafficking, prostitution. Lot of dirty business going on behind closed doors. Really? Yeah. If you are breaking the law in the great state of Texas, get ready. 'Cause we're coming for you. All right. Hey, we got this. Yeah, tonight'll be fine. I'm just -- I'm worried about tomorrow -- the social worker, you know? There's just a lot at stake -- Hey. Lace, Lace, Lace, Lace, Lace. Come on. We're Locklins. I know. We're good, right? All right, I think we're there. Balloons are up. Kids should be here any minute. Have we successfully secured the perimeter? Uh, yeah -- we're gonna contain the kids from 1400 to 1600 hours. All right. Zone defense. I like it. How about the food? Uh, yeah, the pizza's gonna be delivered -- 1800 hours. Good. Okay. I think you guys are just taking this a little bit too serious. Can't we just say "6:00"? No. No. Fine. 1800 hours. There's gluten-free options in the fridge. Right on time. All right. Okay. Let's do this. Put it in. Here we go. All right. "Sleepover" on three. "Sleepover" on three. One, two, three! Sleepover! Sleepover! Sleepover! Whew. All right, you ready? Yeah. Let's go, Beaumont Broncos! Hey! Come on! Dad has a trampoline! Oh, shit. Okay. We're gonna jump until we puke! Okay, guys. Seri-- okay. Hey! Hey! Hey! All right, you know what? 86 the zone. This is full-court press! Full-court press! No -- hey! No cleats on the trampoline! Just two at a time! Two at a time! Hey! He said "no cleats"! Evan, this task force seems dangerous. Well, it's police work, so anything could happen, but with this man overseeing things, what could go wrong? "Judge Overton," was it? Yeah. Yeah. You seem like a guy that doesn't get much time for himself. How about a massage? Oh, I don't know. I'm...feeling fine -- really. Oh, I'd take her up on it, Judge. Riley owns her own spa. She works magic. Might actually help you with your stroke, too. Yeah, I might help you with your stroke. What do you say? Well, a smart man never argues with a beautiful woman. Aww. Lead the way, Ms. Parks. Evan, congratulations again. Right this way. We can try. Hi. Can we help you? Deep tissue? Shiatsu? Actually, I just got my massage license. I was wondering if you all are hiring. We're good. Mm-hmm. We could use some fresh blood. Why don't you leave your résumé? I'll show it to the boss. It seems like a great place to work, especially if it's side-by-side with that guy. Uh-huh. You have a nice day. Hmm. Have a nice day. Don't call us, and we won't call you. You are heading up a task force that is taking down prostitutes? So, what is it -- you just get off on getting me new shoes and then telling me there's nothing to worry about? Ow. That's a little too much pressure. Oh, good. When were you gonna tell me, huh? When my family was watching me on the 10:00 news in handcuffs? Ahh! Geez! Are you trying to kill me? No, but I will if you are setting me up. You know, I sign all the task force warrants. Every move they make, I'm gonna know about it. Now, you have my word -- I've got your back. Do you have mine? I always do. You know what? My hand has a cramp in it. I'm gonna get you someone new. Selena! So, uh... Lot of pros here, huh? I mean golfers. One of them just gave me his card. Like I need help with my stroke. Hey, who's that guy with Derek? Beats me. That's how it happened. I can't believe it. I know. Hell of a shock. I had no idea. None of us did. So, you'll be there tomorrow? Yeah, of course. Take it easy, man. Nice seeing you. You too. So, you're not gonna introduce me to your new boyfriend? Yeah, he is kind of cute. Seriously, I'm not in the mood right now. What -- did you just have a lovers spat? Damn it, Selena. You don't know when to quit, do you? I need a drink. What's his problem? I was just joking. Wake up, Selena. He likes you. You like him. You're a couple. Why don't you start acting like it? Yeah, guys like Derek don't me along every day. Shit. Relationships are hard. Amen to that. Mm-hmm. Oh. Hello. Go for Riley Parks. Hello, ma'am. Sugar Land alarm services. The alarm at the Rub at Sugar Land has been activated, and a unit will be dispatched. Oh, no, no, no. Don't do that. Um...don't do that. I'll take care of it. Thanks so much. Have a good day. Everything okay? Yeah, the alarm went off. Is something wrong? I-I don't know. I'm gonna go check it out. I'm coming with you. No, no. That's okay. I'll go with you. You shouldn't go alone. Okay. Whoa, whoa. H-hold on. They might still be here. No, whoever it is is long gone. I'll get the lights. Oh, wow! Holy... They left the cash and the jewels? What the hell were they looking for? Makes you wonder. I'm calling the cops. No. Unh-unh. No, cops are... They're just bad for business. We'll just let them get away with trashing the place? Well, I-it's the cost for doing what we do. Is there anything I should be worried about? 'Cause I like working here, but I'm not looking for any trouble. Everything is fine, Derek. So why don't you just go back there and tell them that we're all okay? 'Cause the last thing I need is a panicked Georgia. Mm. There's something you're not telling me. It's fine. Got it under control. Okay. This is out of control! I mean, I turn around for just a second, and look at this place. Yeah, they're slippery little suckers. Oh, no. Hey, sweetie. What is wrong? I want to go home. Oh, but why? We're having such a good time. Hey. Hey, hey. What happened? Uncle Dale. What did you do? I made it to the candy cane forest first. These kids have to learn how to deal with adversity. Dale. He's a baby. Selena told me about the alarm. Is there anything I should be worried about? The alarm's more trouble than it's worth, but I've got it taken care of. Mm. That's great to hear. I was getting a little bit nervous. You know if anything happens to the list... Georgia. I got it. Okay? I'm gonna take care of it. - Hey. - Hey. Hi. Everything okay at the Rub? Yeah, it's fine. He's lying. You're lying. If something's wrong, you've got to tell us. Someone trashed Riley's office. That's all I know. She said she has it handled. I shouldn't even be telling you guys this. This is terrible. I just... That's the last thing we need right now. Oh, my God! I got to go! I didn't realize it was so late. I have a huge test tomorrow. On a Sunday? I meant "Monday." See y'all later. Huh. I need a drink. Um, you know what? Derek. Wait. Can I get a beer? About today -- you know, you and that guy -- I just want to explain. It doesn't matter, Selena. Look, I know I said I like your speed... Wait -- can you just listen for one minute? ...but I want to be more than just fun with you. And I'm not afraid to show someone I like them. Okay. If that's what it's gonna take for you to shut up and listen to me, we can PDA all night long. I'm just -- I'm trying to apologize here. I was acting like a freakin' idiot. Can't argue with that. You know, there's a reason why I don't do this. There's a reason why I don't let people get close. But I'm here, so... So, come on. Who was that guy you were talking to earlier? He's in a town for a funeral. One of the guys from my squad, Marcus, killed himself last week. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't -- I knew he was having trouble finding a job. I mean, we all were. I live 10 minutes away. You know, all he needed was a friend. No -- hey, hey, hey. If I had called him -- This isn't your fault. Marcus always had my back. Once, we were out on patrol and we got ambushed. I thought my number was up, and then he just came charging right in. Didn't once think about himself. Well, he sounds like a great guy. He was. And he knew how to have a hell of a good time. He was always pulling me into something. Oh, yeah? I'll bet you have some crazy stories. You wouldn't believe them if I told you. Look, I know you're not interested in this. No, I am interested. Look, I want to know all about Marcus, okay? I have all night. Come on. Come on. What was I thinking? I mean, he's just a kid. Look, I know it sucks. Sometimes, you have to let them win. Right. Right. But I di-- I didn't do that. I trounced on him. He's 8 years old. I made him cry. I'm that guy. You're not that guy. I can't do this, man. Play Candy Land? Be a dad. I mean, I can't even supervise a sleepover. How am I gonna deal with everything else? I'm really not ready for this. Hold up. Are you talking about the adoption interview? Come on. I've seen you with my kids. No one is more ready to be a dad than you. I promised myself that I wouldn't be like my dad, and I don't want to disappoint Lacey, especially right now, after everything that she's gone through. You're gonna go in the interview and you're gonna rock it, and you're gonna raise an awesome kid. Okay, you're not hearing me. I really don't -- No! No! Knock it off! No more whining. Don't be that guy. You're Dale freakin' Locklin, for God's sakes. I'm Dale freakin' Locklin. Yeah, you are. Was that tough love you just gave me? Sort of. I mean, that's kind of what I was going for. I like it. Was it good? It's making me feel good. I'm glad. Ethan wants a rematch. Oh. Well. Uh...Okay. What do you say you and me, double or nothing? You're going down, Butthead. - Oh! - Snap! "Butthead"? I love this kid. All right. Fine. Ladies first. Oh. I hope you brought your wallet. Let's do this. I'll get it. Parks residence. Uh, yes, he is. Just one moment.

You told me that you were going to work. You didn't think I would have you followed? You didn't think I could smell the deception leaking from your pores? No, I -- I didn't mean to -- Cops are after me. Everyone has always been after me. Greg, you're hurting me! You know what hurts me? That I believed in you. That I actually thought you were worth my time. You don't mean that. I gave you one job, and you couldn't get it done! Now I'm through with you! Greg, I'm sorry. Just -- Get out! Please. I'm begging you -- don't do this to me. You did it to yourself. Now get out! Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. Can I borrow you for a second? Thank you. Your loss. What are you doing? You know it's wrong that you're not on the task force. Did you really drag me back here to talk about this? I just kept thinking about how unfair it all was, and Barnes agreed. He told me that the first training spot that opens in detectives -- it's yours. I didn't ask you to do that. I know you didn't, but -- I'm not some damsel in distress that needs rescuing. Of course you're not. I'll make detective on my own. I know that. I should clock you. We should celebrate. Ohh... We're going to. This is Georgia. Leave a message. Hey, Georgia. It's Riley. Um, could you just call me back? Please? It doesn't matter how late. We have to talk. Hi. Go to sleep. Oh. Ow. Hey, hey, hey. You okay? No. Not really. Riley, come here. Let's talk. Look, I know you're going through a hard time, but a good friend of mine once said, "sometimes, "you got to stop thinking and planning and worrying and just say, 'to hell with it.'" she sounds like a great friend. Yeah, she is. She really is. Okay. That's it. What is going on? Nothing, Lacey -- I'm not gonna talk about this right now. No, I'm not leaving -- - I don't want to have this conversation. - Mom! Mom, I can't sleep. Okay, you know what? Let's go get you in bed. Riley, are you -- I'm fine.

And we can finally put all this bad stuff behind us. Oh, my God. Kyle, that is so great. Look. I'm ready to move forward. All right, I know you and I, we still got a lot of work to do. All right, we can keep talking about -- I don't want to talk. I don't want to talk.
