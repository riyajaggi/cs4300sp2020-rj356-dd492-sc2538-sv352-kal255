 for her to be here, so she must want this a lot. >> Gretchen is talented and very confident. >> Christopher, his style is very elegant and wearable. He's cute too. >> Owing to the fact that this is such a talented group of designers, we're going to have to keep them on their toes. >> 'cause it's really tough around here. Very, very tough. This is Project Runway. And Sew It Begins Original Air Date on July 29, 2010 -- Sync by elderman -- -- for www.addic7ed.com -- >> Okay, I know this sounds totally vain, but I think Project Runway is the Ivy show. I started my line, Ivy h., two years ago. So I sleep here and I work here. I was trying to organize a little bit. The fabrics that I use are extremely luxurious. My construction skills are absolutely amazing. I'm a force to be reckoned with. >> I'm Casanova. And I'm from Fajardo, Puerto Rico, but I'm living right now in New York. >> so you're Carlos Casanova, but you want to be called Casanova? >> Please. >> Why? >> it's my real last name. >> it's a big name to live up to. >> we won't even go there. >> I've already done everything in Puerto Rico. Avant-garde style, beauty pageant, haute couture. So I think, "what's next for you?" And I think I belong to New York. I was so nervous thinking, "or New York eat me, or I eat New York? Or New York take me, or I take New York from the balls?" >> I'm Sarah Trost. I grew up in Northern California. I was born in L.A. And now I'm in New York. I definitely use unconventional combinations of materials and colors. So is this totally gross and ugly, or is this, like, the cutest thing I've ever seen? Hi, I'm Sarah. >> A.J., nice to meet you. >> where did you come from? >> I came from St. Charles, Missouri. >> Holy . >> kind of out of my element a little bit. I design for the party girl, the punk rock girl, definitely someone who will wear just about anything. I have no idea if I'm ready for what's coming my way. I could totally lie and say that, like, I'm ready to go and I'm gonna beat everybody, but we all know that anybody who gets on there and says that they're gonna win and kill everyone right now has no idea what they're talking about. >> well, that's cool. To, like, actually talk to somebody. >> and the first person I meet is actually cool. I was afraid that I was gonna meet some, like, really old lady, yeah, who's not gonna know what's going on. >> my name's Peach Carr. I'm 50 years old, and I'm from Lake Forest, Illinois. I design mostly for, like, the ladies who lunch. Well dressed, pretty crisp, clean lines. Am I gonna be the oldest? Hell to the yes. God, yes. In fact, I'm expecting, like a nine-year-old to come walking in and be my roommate. But I think I can win Project Runway because with age does come wisdom. >> hello, there. >> hi, hon. Peach. >> Nicholas. It's nice to meet you. >> we're the same height. >> we are. >> excellent. Same color hair. Love it. >> well, this is gonna be a great time, I'm really excited. I can't wait to beat you. >> beat me? >> yeah. >> oh, I'm sorry. Get ready to be schooled, little boy. >> hi. Kristin. >> Kristin? Casanova. >> Casanova. >> nice to meet you. It's for real. >> oh, okay. I don't think my husband knows. >> where are you from? >> I'm from Philadelphia originally. >> Philadelphia? >> hello. >> hi, how are you? >> McKell. >> hi, McKell, nice to meet you. Kristin. >> Casanova. >> Casanova, nice to meet you. >> where are you from? >> I'm from Utah. >> no, I even... >> Don't turn down your like-- you're like, "I don't know." >> I am from Utah and I do feel like I get that stereotype. But at the end of the day, what I do create I think proves to people that I know what I'm doing. And I have a little baby girl, so it's quite heartbreaking at this moment for me. I'm trying to just, like, adjust and-- >> how old is she? >> she's nine months. >> oh, Jesus. >> to leave my family, it's breaking my heart right now, but I'm just hoping to be able to provide an amazing life for my daughter and to also show her that you can do anything if you really want it. What kind of background do you guys have as far as your designing goes? >> my background is in graphic design. I'm really an accidental apparel designer. Really what makes my designs unique is that I allow the mistakes that I make to be a part of the final piece. Some seamstresses, they said, "oh, no, you can't do that, you can't have a crooked zipper like that," and I said, "yes, you can. You can have a crooked zipper." Embrace the crooked zipper. >> for the fact that I was 14 years old and was trained in High School design didn't hurt me that much because I had a pretty short temper. So if anybody said a word to me, I would straighten them out. I like to mesh menswear, womenswear together, tough looks on women, not so tender on men. I'm kind of wearing this hat here because I kind of want to throw the competition off, look a little intimidating like Roman soldiers and American indians have these mohawks. So me, I'm just putting this hump on my head and wishing for the best, you know? >> my name's Gretchen. >> nice to meet you. Jason Troisi. >> nice to meet you, Jason. >> Gretchen, so what nationality are you? >> um, I'm irish-german. How about you? >> um, irish and Italian. >> yeah. >> yeah. >> hi. >> hi. >> hi. >> I'm Peach. >> Mondo, how are you doing? >> Mondo, excellent. I almost wore the same thing. >> really? >> yeah. >> I'm Nicholas. Nice to meet you. >> Nicholas. Mondo, hi. >> I'm from New York, where are you from? >> uh, Denver, Colorado. People's first impressions of me probably are that he's a little strange. But I think if you're misunderstood, then you have something really good going on. I like the idea of mixing a lot of different ideas to make a look. What do you do? >> me? Well, before I did this, I was an architect. I then went into working-- designing accessories. And been wanting to do my own clothing line for a really long time. So last year, I had my first show and I just kind of dove into it headfirst. The transition from architecture to fashion, it actually was a bit easier than I thought it was going to be. I like to play with seaming, I like to play with menswear materials. And I just feel like it's very architectural when you look at it. >> hi, I'm Ivy. >> hi, I'm Nicholas, it's nice to meet you. >> hi, Ivy, I'm Peach. >> nice to meet you. >> Ivy? >> yes. >> how are you doing? I'm Mondo. >> Mondo, nice to meet you. >> you're cute. >> so are you. Oh, my God, I hope I don't get seasick. >> is this yours? >> it is. It's from my fall collection. >> what is your collection called? >> Ivy h. >> cool. I took forever to name my collection. >> so what is it? >> Nicolena. >> it's pretty. >> it's my grandfather's first name and my grandmother's first name. >> aw. I love the sentiment. >> what do you call your line? Do you have a-- >> I don't call it anything because I don't have one. >> hi. >> hi. >> what's your name? >> I'm Christopher. >> oh, I'm April, nice to meet you. >> April, nice to meet you. >> where are you from? >> I'm from San Francisco. >> oh, awesome, I love San Francisco. >> you do? >> yeah. What do you like to design? >> well, I do women's ready to wear. >> oh, okay. >> for about two years, I've been doing it. One of the greatest experiences that ever happened to me was walking down the street seeing a woman randomly wearing my clothes. Are you ready to go? >> yeah, let's do it. >> you can't pay for that feeling ever in a million years. It's just such a moment. And that's why I do what I do. I want someone to wake up in the morning and think, "what am I gonna wear today? I'm gonna wear Christopher Collins." When's the last time you were in New York? >> I just came up to do some fabric shopping. 'Cause actually, I'm pretty young, I just graduated college, so-- >> oh, congratulations. >> thank you. People might think I'm too young to be taking on a challenge like this, but I'm confident in who I am as a designer. And we'll just have to see what my competition is. This is gonna be really crazy. >> what do you make? >> I love this grungy kind of aesthetic. I'm inspired by things like morgues and you know, I'm making dark beautiful. I'm not the girl to come to to design your tea party dress. In a sense, it's gonna be a little bit gnarly. I like to take things that look as if they're dying and create a beauty out of them. I love to destroy to create. >> I'm Michael. >> I'm Sarah. >> hi, Sarah, nice to meet you. >> A.J., nice to meet you. >> nice to meet you. Where are you from? >> I'm from Palm Springs. >> what do you do out in the desert? >> out in the desert, I make couture-- >> hot. >> hot--haute couture. 17 years old, opened up my first store. I've done great fashion events, I've been in editorial, I've gotten great celebs to wear my dresses. >> I'm just ready to get started. I've kind of been, I don't know, like freaking myself out the whole time to get here. Like, it's definitely different. >> I want a burger. Give me a burger. I will whip up some couture overnight, seriously. >> I love it. >> I came here to win. I'm gonna shut this Down 'cause I have what it takes. >> Oh! >> this is so exciting. >> oh, my God. >> hi, everybody. >> all: Hi. >> welcome to Lincoln Center. >> thank you. >> the new home of New York Fashion Week. Three of you will be showing your final collections here in the fall. But you have a lot to prove to us before any of you find yourself right back here. You all know this distinguished man standing right next to me. Tim Gunn. Chief creative officer for Liz Claiborne. >> thank you, Heidi. >> both: Mwah. >> good morning, designers. I'm thrilled to see all of you here, all 17 of you. I have to tell you, you're all so talented that we just couldn't just narrow the group of you down to the usual 16. Accordingly, your first challenge is actually the last phase of the audition process. >> oh, my God, that is so evil. >> we are still auditioning. That's weird. >> so none of you are officially on Project Runway Season Eight yet. In fact, one or more of you will be eliminated today. >> oh, my God, that sucks. I'm like, come again? Like, that's the worst trick ever. >> that's right. Today is your first challenge, the first runway show, and the first elimination. >> there's 17 people here instead of 16. One of us is going home. It's really nerve-racking because we just got here. >> I mean, I knew that they were gonna spring something crazy on us, but I didn't expect it to be like, "okay, you're trying out" still. Hoo... >> coming up on Project Runway: Since this is a first challenge, there's a Twist. >> oh, . >> this insanity. >> I've never really been criticized on my clothes. >> it's attacking me and-- >> ooh! Somebody's gonna get hit. >> now I see that all of you have your suitcases with you. >> yeah. >> oh, damn. >> please open them up and pull out one item that you would like to incorporate into your garment. >> okay. >> I don't even know what I'm gonna use. >> I got into fashion primarily in knitwear. Knitwear is sort of a different beast. I produce a garment with my knitting machine. It's not exactly draping 'cause you're fully creating one unit. There's nothing cut. And I'm working in knitwear all the time and I'm stepping into something. It's like playing the harpsichord your entire life, and then all of a sudden going to the electric guitar. >> so this item must be worked into your final garment. But since this is a first challenge and we wanna see what you're made of, there's a Twist. And I love little twists. >> of course. >> there's always a Twist. â™ª Dun dun duh â™ª >> please pass your item to the person to your right. >> >> this will be the garment you use in your design. >> ooh. Somebody's gonna get hit. >> aw... >> I kind of stopped breathing. There was no blood in the top half of my body. >> I took, like, one of my favorite pants. It's $1,070. When I realize that they're gonna, like, cut and, like-- >> I gave up my kilt. I was actually gonna wear it tomorrow. So...Guess not. >> designers, you have your new garments and you will have five hours to complete your design before it walks the runway. >> it was shocking to hear that we weren't completely on the show. And then to only have five hours was also, like, "ah!" >> we must be able to see the garment that you're holding right now in your final design in some way. >> it's very bohemian. >> totally. >> all right, designers. Let's head off to parsons and get to work. Very, very exciting to have you. >> it's time to thread. >> exactly. >> my design aesthetic is one part contemporary minimalist art and one part 1970s bohemian. I am a sustainable clothing designer based out of Portland, Oregon. I'm a pretty rural girl from humble backgrounds. Everything I make is hand-dyed by me. I live a pseudo-hippie lifestyle, but fashion first is always how I feel. I always wanna be fashion first. I want you purchasing me 'cause I'm an amazing brand and it just happens to be green. >> how you doin'? >> are you next to me? >> I feel like I'm at camp. >> oh, perfect. >> it's my special ninja. >> oh, that's so cute. Did you make that? >> my sisters and I each have one. The ninja is in New York now. Project Runway ninja. When I was a kid, you know, we didn't have a lot of money. So we used to shop at this store called weiner's. It's kind of like a little better than salvation army but not as good as Wal-Mart clothes. We had to buy a lot of stuff that I wasn't really crazy about, so usually I would try to find cool ways to make them look good. I believe that design should be beautiful, it should be functional, and it should serve a purpose beyond aesthetics. I'm doing this for everyone, for Cleveland, for my interns, for my family. It's a lot of pressure. I'm a little overwhelmed. >> hello, designers. >> hi. >> hi, Tim. >> welcome to the workroom. And I'm pleased to see that you each found your workstations, excellent. Next door is the brother sewing room, called such because it's fully outfitted with brother sewing machines. Technology is playing a greater role in the creative process. We have hp touch smart notebooks for each of you. This technology from hp and intel is here to help you further enhance your creative process. And I have more good news for you. For this challenge, mood has come to us. >> yay. >> also, there is a model card and your model's measurements. They've been randomly selected for you. You'll have 50 minutes to sketch and then we're going to the mood annex. Work hard, everybody. Thank you. >> thanks, Tim. >> bye. >> I know that my aesthetic is different. That's because I'm in Hawaii. I draw from a really genuine place. I began my career designing pageant gowns. And I realized pretty early that it wasn't my passion so now it's my time to design for me. >> I'll be crawling in the fabric bin, holding what's left of my beaded little cardigan. I wanna do a long coat dress. The length of the coat dress is just above the crotch. Yeah, that's kind of the dilemma I'm in. >> I got some hot pink Jersey spandex, so I'm thinking maybe a little hoodie. A little muslim couture, maybe. >> I got pants, which I love making anyway. I'm restructuring the silhouette of the pant and kind of creating a more texturized top. I definitely think it'll be done in time. No doubt. It has to. There's no other option. >> all right, designers. Your sketching time is up, and we're going to the mood annex. Follow me. It's all yours. >> oh, my God. >> this is-- I got this denim skirt from Mondo. I wanted to make a jacket, but I don't know if I really will have a whole lot of time for a jacket. It might be a dress. I don't know. >> this is from a jacket that April ended up having to give me that she loves. I'm gonna make it work, 'cause that's what we're supposed to do. >> I got just a basic button-up shirt from A.J. I was hoping he had something that would be a little more inspiring. >> oh, , I just tore the wrong seam. I'm sorry. I got Casanova's dolce & gabbana pants. He hadn't even worn them yet. >> I bring to her my nice pants, dolce & gabbana. She was, like, cutting. >> how much were they? She was, like, cutting. 'Cause they were, like, $1,070. >> don't talk anymore about the pants. Stop that. It's kind of insanity. >> Jason, what's going on? How's it going? >> going really good. >> cool. That makes one of us. >> Andrew has a beautiful kimono. And I'm just taking it, wrapping the sleeves around the neck, messing with the waistband the way I would do it. >> it'll make me wanna cry if I see the kimono in pieces and it's ugly. Aw. >> hi. I'm about to just-- well, it's attacking me. It's been unraveling. It is Michael d's mystery color scarf. When the judges start throwing rocks at me, I'm going to let them know that the minute you touch this, the whole thing becomes thread. Help me! >> with all due respect, if you're a designer, you should know how to work with... A feed bag. >> oh, God. >> coming up on Project Runway: >> is it sexy? Or is it vulgar? The clock is ticking. >> I think he doesn't like it. At all. >> I'm a nervous wreck right now. But it's more so the time restriction than anything. I mean, five hours is a really short time. >> designers, I just wanna check in with each of you and see how you're doing. So is everyone surviving? A.J., you're okay? Yep. And McKell? >> hello. >> how are you doing? >> well, at this point, I'm feeling a little frazzled. >> can I be honest with you? I think this is adorable. >> oh, that's good. That makes me happy. I started out with just a plain blue man's shirt with these-- >> well, that's-- >> yeah. >> good heavens. >> I was thinking of maybe putting them on the shoulders, just as a little epaulette, and kind of bringing in this metallic. >> just think about whether this makes it a little too heavy- handed. >> okay, well, that's-- >> and here, I just feel like it's trying too hard. >> yeah, okay. >> just play with it. >> okay. >> thank you. >> thank you. >> Nicholas. >> hi, Tim. >> so what did you start out with? >> I started out with a jacket that was made out of polyester. >> oh, we love polyester. >> well, yeah, but not so much. I'm gonna take the bottom of the jacket. I'm making it into a neckline. So I was gonna cowl it. Something like this on her. >> I have to tell you, I'm very intrigued by the whole notion of incorporating something that's very sportswear-like into something that's elegant and evening. Potentially very provocative and also very good. It's not there yet. >> no, I know it's not. >> so keep pushing it. >> thank you, Tim. >> thank you. Casanova. >> yes? >> how are you? >> good. >> yeah? >> mm-hmm. >> really and truly? >> >> you don't look good. >> I know. But I feel better than before. >> there's a lot of skin that will be showing, yes? >> mm-hmm. >> is it sexy? Or is it vulgar? >> no, I think it's sexy. >> really? >> mm-hmm. >> it looks awfully low in the back. So you started with a blouse. >> exactly. >> you wouldn't know that now. >> I think he doesn't like it at all, nothing. Nothing at all. >> then I would say you're doing well for what you have to work with. >> exactly. >> okay. Have her work it on that runway. >> okay. >> thank you, Casanova. >> you're welcome. >> hi, April. >> hey, Tim. >> so talk to me. What are you doing? >> well, I started out with a men's tuxedo jacket. >> oh, it was a tuxedo jacket? >> yeah, and I turned it inside out 'cause I thought that these style lines and these pockets were really cool. >> how are you finishing this, though? >> I haven't really figured it out yet. >> April. >> I don't know if I should-- >> the clock is ticking. >> I know. >> you have decisions to make. >> yeah. >> all right? >> okay. >> all right, I'm gonna let you carry on. >> all right, sounds good. Thanks, Tim. >> all right. Don't overthink. >> okay. >> April, yeah, she's not doing so great. I mean, she basically just took the sleeves off and puffed them up on top and it's not really innovative. It's bad. >> Jason. >> Mr. Gunn. Step into my office. How are you? >> what is this item? It's a fashion corset. >> yeah. >> it's a designer's corset. >> that's right. >> all right. So what did you start out with? >> I started out with a kimono. >> it's a kimono, okay. >> yeah, so I was really lucky I had a lot of fabric, so-- >> is there any other fabric introduced into this? >> no, I wasn't really attracted to the fabric. >> is the transformation for the most part putting the kimono on backwards? >> it could be because of time restraints, but I had these sleeves going ov her neck and this great neck happening for, um-- >> so I'm looking around the room, and I see Jason. And I'm thinking to myself, "well, I shouldn't feel so bad because I mean, his is worse than mine." >> all right. Thank you, Jason. >> sure. >> Gretchen. >> hi. >> what did you start out with? >> I started out with a little cape-like jacket with lots of applique. I didn't wanna just approach this as, like, I'm using all the fabric or all the applique but, like, what's the essence of this piece and what type of girl would be wearing it, how that translates through not only to the piece but how I'm styling. >> that's thoughtful. >> the most important things is obviously the one little top pop of color. >> mm-hmm. >> so I needed to use the red bead and I'm pairing it with this boot. >> I'm completely with you. >> very simple. >> yeah. Okay, great. >> okay. Thank you. >> thank you very much, Gretchen. >> hi, Tim. >> Peach, hi. Talk to me. Tell me what you're doing. What did you start out with? >> oh, for the love of God and all that's Holy, wait till you see what I got. >> this is what you have? >> uh-huh. >> what is it? >> it's a tube scarf that Michael knitted, but watch this. Oh, look, now it died. >> oh, my God. >> I know, so I couldn't go sweater, I couldn't go skirt because you knew it was gonna hang-- >> it has no forgiveness. >> I know, and it's not forgiving me. >> can you mesh it under some tulle in some way and use it? I think that's your solution. >> I think you're a God. >> listen, if you have to glue her in, do it. >> okay. >> okay? >> thank you, Tim. >> okay, thank you, Peach. Mondo. >> hi. >> how are you doing? >> good. >> so what did you start with? >> a coat. These were the sleeves, these were capped sleeves. >> all right. >> I wanted to make this from the original capped sleeve. A capped sleeve out of the wool. >> can I just tell you something? >> yeah. >> I think you need to give this some youthfulness. And maybe in the styling of it and maybe in your model's hair and makeup. >> okay. >> 'cause it's looking a little matronly to me. >> really? >> yeah. >> okay. >> the capped sleeve worries me. >> okay. >> all right, I'm taking up your time, go, go, go. >> all right. >> all right, thank you, Mondo. >> thank you. >> I know how to make it works. >> I'm incredibly nervous. I need to finish this dress. That's what's going through my head. I don't even know what I'm doing. >> I'm gonna be sick. >> coming up on Project Runway: >> she's pretty busty for a model. It's a big Distraction. >> hey, sweetheart. >> my heart is pumping. I'm a nervous wreck. >> I have absolutely no clue what to do. I think I'm gonna pass out. >> she's done? >> yeah. >> designers, I'm sending in your models. You will have ten minutes to fit them, all right? Then they are going to the garnier hair salon and the l'oreal Paris makeup room. That will take an hour. When they return, you'll be styling them for the runway. Use the piperlime accessory wall very thoughtfully. All right, I'm sending in your models. >> Vanessa? >> hey. >> hello. >> very nice to meet you. >> nice to meet you as well. >> oh, look at you! Okay, girlfriend, we're gonna get so far, okay? I am, like, so in this. >> so it should be really simple. >> bouncy, but a little... Military. >> oh, my God. It's the only way I'm gonna be able to get anywhere. >> you like it? >> yeah. >> okay, good. >> someone in our van said that, like, "oh, that girl looks like vera wang, she's gonna shut it down." They thought you were, like, hardcore. >> oh, me? >> yeah, they thought you were hardcore, man. >> oh. I'm like a quiet storm. I don't think that being a little ambitious will hurt me. But I definitely think that I'm a fast sewer so I just am trying to work as quickly as possible. And I think I'm in pretty good shape. I'm like the energizer bunny. >> that's really, really cool, Andy. I hate you a little bit. >> sorry. >> she's really, um, she's pretty busty for a model, but-- it's a big Distraction, I'm not gonna lie. She has no bra and she's, like, mine, you know? I'm like, "oh, my God." And I don't wanna cross the boundaries like a doctor would, but I mean, come on. >> does anyone have a chalk wheel? Where's my chalk wheel? >> is anybody, like, super, super confident or super, super nervous? >> I'm super, super nervous. >> I'm nervous. Just gonna send up a prayer. >> so I want, like, a mohawk, but it's--I want it curled. 'Cause it has, like, a military feel, but I still want it very girly. >> we can give the essence of a mohawk. It can happen. >> you know, board, board straight down here, or, you know, maybe a little something more. >> stick straight? >> I don't know. Is it--well, wavy better, you think? >> it's your vision that I'm trying to execute. >> oh, I think I wanna do something kind of like she got electrocuted. I want it kind of wild and big. Like a little medusa-ish, you know what I mean? >> I have absolutely no clue what to do. >> okay, I want, like, big hair. >> uh-huh. >> like big curls. >> we're in makeup. >> okay. Makeup. >> maybe something sort of whimsical, but nothing like a drag queen, right? >> I want my lips to match. I want a little bit matte. I want a clean face, a little bit dewy. >> I want her to have a strong brow. Tie her face up so she's tough. >> designers and models. In 15 minutes, we are walking down to the runway fully prepared for the runway show. Thank you. >> where is my--I gotta-- I'd better go check on my model. Of course, it's madness. I just take my model down to hair and I kind of forgot about her. Sorry, sweetheart. Come on. >> tell me quick. >> just quick, just bright, bold red lip. >> bright, bold red lip. >> yes. >> okay, thank you. >> Easy enough. Easy enough. >> it's getting down to the wire and I'm freaking out. My heart is pumping, I'm a nervous wreck. I'm not on the show yet. I need to prove myself through this challenge to make it on the show. >> I think we're good. I don't wanna freak out by overthinking things. >> see if that helps. >> I have her sewn into the dress. And I'm feeling really good while the last few minutes are ticking by. I think it turned out really cute. >> my hands are shaking like somebody's electrocuting me. I think I'm gonna pass out. >> Jason had staples in his garment holding it together. I'm not really quite sure what happened there, but I don't really know what to make of Jason. >> designers and models, this is it. Is everyone listening? We're headed down to the runway right now, so follow me. Come on, everyone. Go, go, go. >> okay, we gotta go. >> let's go. >> when Tim Gunn says that it's time to go, my model was undressed. >> oh, she's not in her dress? >> no. >> Just keep going, Casanova. You have to put her in it. >> and I realized that I was working behind schedule. She's dressed. She's done. >> you just dressed her? >> yeah, yeah. I did. She's done. What I have to do-- >> she's done? >> yeah. She just have to put this in here. That's it. >> well, then, do that. Right now. All right, that's it. >> coming up on Project Runway: >> I'm sorry, I think it is butt ugly. >> she's a pole dancer in Dubai. >> it's almost fascinatingly bad. >> welcome to the runway. As you know in fashion, one day you're in and the next day you're out. There are 17 of you here. And after tonight, there will be, mm... Less than 17. The first challenge was the final stage in your audition process. The 17 of you had to use an item from another designer's suitcase to create your look. We gave you a measly five hours to put a look together. We know you've got the talent, but can you deliver under pressure? The winner of Project Runway will receive $100,000 from l'oreal Paris to start their own line, a fashion spread in marie claire magazine, a $50,000 technology suite from hp and intel to create your vision and run your business, and the opportunity to design and sell your exclusive line on piperlime.Com. And the model paired with the winner of Project Runway will receive a fashion spread in marie claire magazine and $25,000 from l'oreal Paris studio secrets professional. Okay, let's meet the judges. First we have cfda lifetime achievement award winner, Michael kors. >> welcome, guys. >> fashion director for marie claire magazine, Nina Garcia. >> welcome, everyone. >> and actress named to the international best dressed list, Selma Blair. >> hi. Thank you. Thank you. >> we will score your designs as they come down the runway. One of you will be named the winner, and one or more of you will be out. Let's start the show. >> I feel really good about my dress. We didn't have a lot to work with. I think my model's walking great, the styling is spot-on. I mean, I made that thing in less than five hours. I'm just concerned about what the judges have to think. >> I'm excited to see efie come down the runway in my garment. I think it looks great, I think she's walking the daylights out of it. I'm excited. I'm really at peace. >> my dress is definitely moving. I wish I would have maybe taken a little of the fullness out of the dress because the dress is looking fuller than how I want it to look. >> watching my look come down the runway, I feel really good. I'm seeing a complete look come down, a complete look that looks like I've spent days on it. And I know that I had only five hours to do this. I think that's pretty amazing. >> I definitely feel good about the finished product of my look. The main thing that I was worried about is that there was gonna be some sort of crotch problem, but I definitely think it was good. >> I made Julia look beautiful. I really like clean, sophisticated garments. My only concern is, I know the judges are looking for innovative, over-the-top stuff. And sometimes, that's kind of not what I do. >> I see my dress, and I love it, I really do. But I'm worried about the hem 'cause it was a little wonky. But overall, the styling and the way she's selling it is working really well. >> I think she looks gorgeous. I think the look works great. It's very impressive seeing what it looks like on the model. So I'm feeling pretty good right now. >> I was so excited that when I saw my dress coming down the runway. I was like, "oh, it looks so good." Wow. I love the whole flow of it. This is a classy, elegant, sophisticated look. >> I really like the whole look. I think the judges were pleased with the look and what I did with it and how I incorporated Mondo's kilt and made it a collar. >> the look I made is definitely me. It's a five-hour taste of what I am, but I feel like I got my message through, and I was proud of it. >> when I see my garment walk out, I think it's cool, it's modern, it's edgy, it's forward. But I was just unhappy that I couldn't have everything completely done and tailored. But I just didn't have the time. >> my model comes around the corner, and I nailed it. She looks stunning. I feel like she embodied what I needed. I could tell she really liked it. And I think those things are all key in making your challenge turn into a win. >> everything about my garment I absolutely love. I'm really happy with the hair and makeup, the model's fabulous, and it looks wonderful. And I was really, really proud. >> so my look coming down the runway is not holding up. It's coming apart at the seams. I know I'm in for it. >> when I first see the silhouette, I'm terrified because I can't tell how together it is. Once it finally really hits the runway, I actually think that it looks pretty good. However, I do think that I might have to defend myself in terms of aesthetic as I feel like I have the garment that stands out the most. >> when I saw my model, I feel more comfortable because onstage, it looks like prettier than on my working table. It's sexy, but it's not vulgar. >> those of you who survive tonight will be moving into Project Runway's original New York home at the atlas. If I call your name, please step forward. A.J. Andy, please step forward. Valerie. Sarah. Peach. Please step forward. Kristin, please step forward. Michael costello, please step forward. Mondo, please step forward. Michael drummond. Christopher, please step forward. If I have called your name, congratulations. Your scores have qualified you to move on to the next challenge. You can leave the runway, and you can unpack. >> oh! >> Holy smokes. >> yay, yes! >> way to go, mom! >> let's hear it for the old lady. >> for this challenge, we had a rare, unanimous decision. One of you is the clear winner. Gretchen. You are the winner of this challenge. Congratulations. >> thank you. Thank you so much. >> you had one of the worst materials to work with. >> tell me about it. >> and you turned it into something chic and fashionable. >> thank you. >> the dress is wearable but interesting. It's beautifully cut. I can see it on a million different girls. Bravo. >> thank you. >> I thought she looked very sophisticated. I also love your styling. It was just perfectly done. Congratulations. >> I agree. I thought it was simply elegant when you came out. It was like, "ah." It really was really a special, simple dress. >> thank you. Thank you all very much. >> congratulations, Gretchen. You and your model can leave the runway. >> did you win? >> you won. >> I won. And it feels really good. I also feel a little weird because I have a sinking suspicion that there are a lot of people going home tonight. >> since this is the final stage of the audition process, today we do not have a top three and a bottom three. All of you are in the bottom. >> I'm a really nervous wreck now 'cause I'm thinking like, "oh, my God, like, you know, there's a chance that I may not even make it on the show." >> none of you should feel safe. >> the rest of you represent the bottom six. Since this is the last phase of your audition process, we're going to talk to and hear from all of you. Ivy. Tell us about your look. >> the garment that I started with was Peaches' pant. I guess my design aesthetic is a little more minimalistic, where it's more attention to detail. Like on the side of the pant here, I have the pleating detail and the embellishment on the blouse. >> well, no offense to Peach, but I don't know why she packed those. But you didn't transform. >> well, the challenge wasn't to transform. It was to implicate into our design, so-- >> well, you just showed her pants and ruched them up the side. And I look at the blouse, which to me kind of looks like it went through a paper shredder. It really tells no story. And then the hoop earring on top of it, I mean-- >> really? Oh, I like the earring. >> she's got a lot of personalities going on in one outfit. It's very confusing to me. >> you took the pant and made it into a Capri, basically. >> sorry to interrupt or interject, but I don't know. I guess I just have to disagree 'cause I just feel like there's a lot of detail to it. >> forget what you did to the pant or not. The blouse looks mumsy. It's an odd length. Then to top that off, the styling is a disaster. >> I, too, had the same thought. When it came out, I was like, "wow, she made pants out of pants. How interesting. Not." >> I mean, it's such an unfortunate pant to begin with. All in all, it looks very, yeah, kind of small town hick outfit night at the bar. >> I mean, I stand by my design. I think it's beautiful. So I'm sorry that it's not your favorite. >> Jason. Tell us about your look. >> so I got this kimono, beautiful kimono from Andy. When my model came in, the size didn't really, it wasn't really fitting her so, you know, I kind of adjusted the fit. And every time she came out, it just kept sinking and sinking. And there's really nothing you guys can say that I won't agree with. >> Jason, Jason, Jason. This, to me, looks exactly like my hairdressing cape I was wearing when I had my haircut. And then when I look at what you had to work with, not much has changed. It's kind of just the other way around. >> this obviously is a really short challenge and you can see where it's unfinished. However, I think there's something interesting about it that it hangs in such a drab way. I'm confused and I don't totally mind what it could be. >> it got drabber as the night progressed, so. >> it's a little sad. It's a little backwards bathrobe. >> wait. Question. Did you think you could just put it on backwards and we wouldn't notice? >> no, no, no, no, no. I cinched the waist up here. You can see where it's sewn. >> ew, I see that, but it-- >> we can also see where it's pinned. >> but it's backwards. >> you have pins in the garment. >> it's just time restraints. >> so you left the pins? >> well... Yeah, I guess. >> I don't know, it just doesn't work. >> April. >> I received a men's blazer. And I cut out the front panels and turned it inside out. And then I took fabric from mood and did the dress underneath and then the back panels. I wanted it to be kind of raw and kind of unfinished. >> that always worries me too, you know, when people do this-- >> hack and sew. Hack and sew. >> because then you never know, is it because you don't know how to do it? What happens when she takes the belt off, can we have a look? So this is the jacket. Did you turn it around, or what happened? >> yeah, I got rid of the lapel and-- >> this is like a hot mess. >> totally strange. >> >> you know, I actually like deconstructed clothes. If you're gonna do deconstruction, we've gotta be able to see that, in fact, you can construct. >> right, okay. >> she looks like an '80s street Walker. I mean, it just looks trashy. >> Okay. I think if I was allotted a longer amount of time, I think that I could really show you what I can do. >> McKell. >> okay, so I got A.J.'S short-sleeved button-down shirt. And it had some metal bits on the shoulder. And I got rid of the metal bits up here and brought some metallic into her skirt. And then I just wanted to make it fun and flirty and a good time. >> I like the fact that you mixed these fabrics, that precious fabric with that common, just button-down shirt. But the styling again, guys, you have to be very mindful of that because it's all about the presentation. That bag, it's the flower with the hair. >> the styling, I agree with Nina, it's a train wreck. To me, it looks like some kind of disco kind of apron. And I love the idea of something glamorous mixed with something utilitarian. But I don't get any cohesion here at all, even in the contrast. Can I see the side? Yeah. Hello, world. I mean, side cleavage is a rare thrilling moment for any woman. >> I have to say too, and I'm sorry, I think it is butt ugly. It is just so not flattering. >> I typically design very tailored things, and this is pretty out of the box, which is ironic that I got so destroyed with my choice. And hopefully, I can show you more of what I do. >> Nicholas. >> the item I had to work with was Christopher's bomber jacket. >> mm-hmm. >> this was actually the bottom of the jacket, the ribbing. And I had this idea of trying to take this sportswear and trying to mix it with an evening look. >> it looks very odd to me. And on top of it, I think it's really boring. >> oh, I'm sorry. >> the whole thing really just doesn't mesh together. >> Nicholas, I think the idea of doing sportswear and evening sounds fantastic. But this is too quiet. So it's almost like it's a snooze. >> I was concerned with the time restraints. I'm a little bit sorry I didn't go a bit more dramatic, you know, with the skirt, because I certainly can do things like that. So I just really hope I get another chance to show you guys what I could really do with a little bit more time. >> Casanova. >> the garment that I have to work with was the kind of blouse with a lot of movement, a lot of tails. So I was trying to find another fabric and still match with the original one. >> it's odd. I mean, it's the only word for it. I mean, it's this strange mix of things. She's like a mother of the bride who's a belly dancer. I mean, she's sexaholic, but she's conservative. I don't know who she is. She's a pole dancer in Dubai. >> it is questionable in taste. It's almost fascinating. But it's just fascinatingly bad. Can we see the back, please? >> I think it's interesting. When you moved, there was something fascinating. I mean, I loved how daring it was in the back and I also loathed it. I mean, at least it got a reaction. >> I was thinking in a bathing suit top and a sarong. >> right, right. >> Casanova. Take one last attempt to defend yourself. Do I see a big old question mark over your head? >> yes. >> did you understand the question? >> no. >> miss Garcia will be the translator. >> oh. >> Casanova... >> oh. >> Thank you for the translation. Probably I should still think out of the box, but in a more conservative way. Probably. >> okay. We've heard what you had to say. We're gonna have a little chat, and we'll bring you back out. You can leave the runway. Thank you. >> oh, what happened, what happened, what happened? >> we don't know yet. >> you don't know yet? >> what? >> I think I wanna go home, guys. We can just cancel the Ivy show. 'Cause seriously, Ivy right now is, like, beaten down, spit on, and rolled over like a sad dog. >> I think two are going home. >> I do too. >> all right, why don't we start with Ivy? >> Ivy. >> who made pants out of pants. >> what a stretch. >> what a stretch. And she didn't quite understand that. >> even though she didn't understand the challenge, to build a blouse like that to go with that-- >> but how can you think that, that you're not supposed to touch the pant? >> excuse me, when something's that unattractive, you certainly need to transform them. You know, I think the whole thing was just a ridiculous mess when you think about it all together. >> but she sewed. >> she knows how to make clothes. Whether she has any taste or talent-- >> right. >> that I don't know. >> she actually tried to convince us, to no avail, that this was good taste and this was good. >> Casanova. Casanova either has a hearing problem, or he doesn't speak English. >> doesn't speak English that well. I can't figure it out. >> he definitely thought outside of the box. I mean, that's a blouse turned into a belly dancing dress. I mean, it's an odd one. And the taste level is certainly scary. You wouldn't dream of ever hitting broad daylight in this dress, it's just-- >> I don't think anybody would dream of coming up with this outfit from that blouse. That's what's so remarkable. >> no, it seems like ten years ago. >> you'd find it in a weird kind of store in the mall that has a name like...Dazzles. >> razzle dazzled. >> yeah, razzle dazzled, where they sell, like, wigs and dresses. >> there is something intriguing. >> yes. >> what could the car crash be? >> yeah. >> you know? I mean, it's an odd one. >> really? >> I don't know. >> let's talk about Jason. His story was so bizarre. >> yeah. >> he's the only one who actually had a lot of fabric. He had all of it, and all he did was flip it. >> why is done using the sewing machine? >> but I do actually like the way it kind of was put together. I like the boot with it. I like the-- >> the spiky hair. >> I like the spiky, gel-y hair. >> I mean, at least it was a look. >> there was a lot of story to not much outfit. >> that's true. >> what do we think about April? >> I think she obviously was frazzled by the time involved. I think today it was a mess when you really looked at the outfit. >> but at least the taste is modern, it's now. It doesn't look so like a pastiche from another time. >> yes, I agree. >> who knows if she knows how to actually make clothes? >> right. >> but this challenge was, like, the shortest one you guys have ever done-- >> ever. In history. >> so for the unfinished seams and everything, it's like, you feel like you really have to say, "okay, I get it." I mean, they had five hours for this on their first day? >> what about McKell? She definitely lives in a different world. >> she's in an alternate universe. The only thing to me that had any merit there was the idea that she thought, okay, I'm gonna take this very casual shirt-- >> right. And mix it with-- >> and I'm gonna go glam with it and mix it up. >> and I'm gonna chop the sleeves off. >> it just didn't work. >> yeah, and she made the model look unflattering. That was very unflattering on her body. >> the accessories were a disaster. >> atrocious. >> the hair too. The hair was really horrible. >> yeah, everything. So I don't know, is there something cool in her that we didn't see today? I don't know. >> what about Nicholas? >> he's got a girl who's gorgeous. And I think she could wear a bag. But even her beauty didn't sell you the gown, which was just a boring dress. He, on the other hand, I'm bored, but I know he knows how to make clothes. I mean, it was a finished evening gown-- >> and he was very concerned to deliver something that looked well made and finished. It was very respectful. >> mm-hmm. >> but he sent out a boring dress. Do you reward the person who's safe, or do you, you know, reward someone who it didn't work but they at least tried? I don't know. >> is there anyone that we wanna give a second chance to? >> I think so. >> all right, let's bring them back out. The six of you were in the bottom of this challenge. This was our first impression of you. And none of you should feel safe. >> the six of you were in the bottom of this challenge. This was our first impression of you. April. We want to see more from you. You're in. You can leave the runway. >> Thank you. Make room for me on that couch. >> yay! >> yay! >> Nicholas. We want to see if you can push yourself given more time. You're in. You can leave the runway. >> thank you so much. I will push myself so hard. Thank you. Thank you so much. >> yay! >> Jason. We are intrigued. You're in. You can leave the runway. >> thank you. >> oh, man. >> McKell. We were perplexed, not only by your design but also by your poor styling choices. Casanova. No one can say that you didn't think outside of the box. Your look was fascinatingly bizarre, and we question your taste. Ivy. You didn't stretch yourself in this challenge. You made pants out of pants, and not very well at that. McKell. I'm sorry, you're out. Wiedersehen. >> thanks. >> yay. >> I didn't make the cut. >> you didn't? >> no. I'm out. >> you're out? >> yeah. >> aw... >> are you messing with us? >> no, I'm not messing with you. >> oh... >> that must be really sad. >> Ivy. Casanova. You're both getting another shot. >>  Thank you. >> there's something about each of you that interests us. You're both in. You can leave the runway. >> thank you so much. >> thank you. Gracias. >> uh-oh. >> what happened? >> what? What happened? >> we got in. >> we are in! >> how is everybody? I always feel sick about the first designer that's off the show. McKell. I have to tell you something. I stand by my earlier statement. The dress is adorable. Didn't fit your model very well, and there was the dubious styling. But it's a lesson to all of you. It's every little subtlety and nuance. We're gonna miss you. >> thank you. >> all right. So I have to send you to the workroom to clean up your space, okay? Bye, McKell. >> I'm feeling a little bummed, but, you know, I guess someone has to be the first, and that's me. It's hard to follow your dreams. Sometimes you get knocked down, but if everyone quit after the first time they got knocked down, no one would amount to anything. So hopefully, I'll pick myself up and do something really great with this experience. >> moving into atlas is so surreal. I made it, I'm in the cut. Like, here we go, project runway. >> oh, wow. >> we made it here. >> and the apartment's very cool. We opened up the curtains and there was larger than life New York city. >> "welcome designers!" Thanks, Tim. >> they need to start providing alcohol. >>  >> this is so pretty. This is way better than camp. >> I don't sleep, I'm a vampire. >> what? >> I never ever, ever want to be on the bottom again. That feeling really, really sucked. Mm-hmm. >> I wonder what we're gonna do tomorrow, though. >> I'm scared about tomorrow's challenge-- how do you feel? Because you was, like, in the same boat. >> I'm happy I got today over with. >> hopefully, when I wake up tomorrow, I feel like-- >> yeah, you just need a good night's sleep. But really, they wanna see more work from you. So I think that's successful. >> good night, bitches. >> good night. >> well, let's go to bed. >> yeah. >> I'm tired. >> good night, Sarah. >> good night, Gretchen. >> good night, John boy. >>  >> okay, so now I'm finally on the show? Like, what's next? >> next time on Project Runway: >> the winner of this challenge will have their look featured. >> Whoo! >> I mean, that is huge! >> you have one day for this challenge. >> oh! >> there is another element. >> so plan "b." >> if they don't see something that's superbly finished, they will not have the patience. Do you have a sketch? >> no, it's all in my head. >> >> you tried to do way too many things with your design. >> it just looks very cliche. >> is that a walk of shame dress? >> the question is now, how many people do we wanna get rid of?
