 like, aah! >> oh, [Bleep]. >> is the transformation putting the kimono on backwards? >> it could be because of the time restraint. >> is it sexy, or is it vulgar? >> this insanity. >> it looks very hick outfit night at the bar. >> she's a pole dancer in Dubai. >> I think it is butt-ugly. >> the styling, it's a train wreck.

 >> for this challenge, we had a rare unanimous decision. Gretchen, you are the winner of this challenge. Congratulations. McKell, I'm sorry, you're out. >> moving into Atlas is so surreal. We made it here. >> okay, so now I'm finally on the show? Like, what's next? >> This is Project Runway. Larger Than Life Original Air Date on August 5, 2010 >> yes! >> let's go! >> the search for the next big fashion designer. >> I was born ready! >> you know you love this. >> you're either in... >> or you're out. >> it's about fashion. >> who will be the next great fashion designer? >> I'm the best there is. >> 17 designers. >> this is my chance. >> three finalists. >> but only one can be the winner. >> it's Fashion Week or go home. >> I've come way too far to lose. >> for these 17 designers, Project Runway is the chance of a lifetime. The winner of Project Runway will receive $100,000 from L'Oreal Paris to start their own line, a fashion spread in Marie Claire magazine, a $50,000 technology suite from HP and Intel to create their vision and run their business, and the opportunity to design and sell your exclusive line on Piperlime.Com. The model paired with the winner of Project Runway will receive a fashion spread in Marie Claire magazine and $25,000 from L'Oreal Paris Studio Secrets Professional. >> good morning, ladies. >> wake up. >> oh, man. >> so I wake up this morning, and I am dead. Like, literally dead. Like, take my pulse, it's not there zombie sort of thing. I'm pretty sure this show is not about fashion design. It's about public torture of designers on television. >> moving into Atlas was such a good experience because it meant that I made it, it meant that I was in it, and we were ready to go. >> I was pretty shocked that McKell was the one to be booted off. I feel-- i feel a little bit sad for her. I was kind of shocked that McKell left. Her dress was very safe. It was cute, though. I mean, I just didn't think that she deserved to go home. I really didn't. Yeah, and one bathroom. Are you kidding? We'd never get out of here. >> actually, you know what's probably gonna be a worse room is the boys'. >> Peach is really, really sweet. She's like-- she's like my surrogate mother right now--it's so cool. >> high-maintenance boys in that bathroom. >> shut up, you do not have the airbrush makeup thingy. Does it really work? Does it work good? Is it, like... >> ugh. >> I only know Casanova so far. Like, I haven't really had a chance to talk to the other guys. There's a little bit of nervousness. And then Jason's really quiet, and Christopher's, like, this hot guy. And Mondo, my first impression is a weird guy, you know. >> I think it's a lot of different personalities in one room, all the time. And usually, I'm pretty much, you know, by myself. If I don't click with people right away, I tend to run away. >> you want me to do yours? >> so it's been really difficult. >> let's blow this joint. >> all right. >> the hell hounds await. >> yeah, I don't want to waste any time. >> hello, everybody. >> all: Hi. >> congratulations. You made it through the final audition of Project Runway, and you are officially on the show. [Cheers and applause] >> furthermore, you should all be very proud of what you achieved in the last challenge, especially given the time frame. >> thank you. >> it's finally sunk in that I'm on Project Runway. And this is absolutely crazy. >> we're thrilled to have Joanna Coles, Editor and Chief of Marie Claire magazine with us today. She's going to tell you all about your next challenge. >> for this challenge, Marie Claire wants you to design a look that tells the audience in a single brief glance who the Marie Claire woman is. She's intelligent, she's practical. She's fashion-forward, confident, and sexy. The winner of this challenge will have their look featured in the Marie Claire billboard campaign running in New York's Times Square. >> that is super-exciting. I mean, that is huge! >> who gets on a billboard, unless you're, like, a Calvin Klein model, or U2? >> getting your garment on a billboard is huge. Because that's a huge prize for the first challenge. >> it's going to appear 40-feet tall, so bad workmanship will show up. And the billboard image will be photographed by one of the hottest fashion photographers around, James Macari, who shoots the Victoria's Secret campaign, and does many fashion shoots for Marie Claire. >> I would love to tell everybody, "hey, go to Times Square, look up." And there is my piece on a 40-foot billboard. It's just so operatic, I can't stand it. >> you have one day for this challenge, which, compared to what you just went through is a luxury. Say good-bye to Heidi and Joanna. We're headed off to the work room at Parsons. Come with me. >> bye, everybody. I'll see you on the Runway. >> all right, designers, you have 30 minutes to sketch, all right? >> all right. >> and I will return. Work hard. Thank you. >> see you, Tim. >> my vision for this challenge is, you know, grunge, punk rock. Immediately, the image of kind of Courtney Love and Gwen Stefani, Blondie. An outfit that they would wear to a rock show. That's what I'm sketching. That's what I want to do. >> I'm trying to sketch, and nothing's happening, so I just think, just run to the fabrics that you love, and you'll figure something out. >> so what I decided to do is something that I haven't done yet, and I threw myself a curve ball and decided to do pants. It's all about shape and... It is going to be very Marie Claire. >> during sketch time, I actually make a list, you know, which I don't think a lot of designers do. They draw their design and whatever, you know, and I make a list of the things that I know i need to get...Like what kind of fabric I want, the colors... The color story, you know, and like the notions, the zippers. 'Cause I will forget about that, you know? And once I get back into the workroom, that's when I start designing in my head. >> my design is the infinity dress. It was a concept I had in my mind for a long time. It also represents an 8 for Project Runway, season 8. I like this idea because infinity's a very positive sign. People get anxiety and fear when they think about death. And infinity is just, you know, it's forever. What's better than infinity? >> designers, sketching time is up. Bring with you whatever you need for our shopping exposition at mood. It's our first trip to mood. Very exciting. You have your $150 budget. All right, you have 30 minutes beginning now. >> $150 is not much to make a sophisticated gown. But the time to find the fabric is not good. >> oh! >> I'm sorry! >> ahem. >> I'm doing a very, very cute, architecturally detailed miniskirt...And it has a very drapey silk top... With this idea where I've taken a complete circle, and I'm gonna be draping a little jacket out of it. The thing's gonna be absolutely amazing and really innovative. >> what I'm looking for is a cotton, tweedy, houndstooth-y kind of thing. Isn't there one more lane down here? All they have is wool. And I grabbed this polka-dotted stuff and this brown dupioni, and it's bad. >> oh, my God! What a nightmare! I can't find the right color that I was thinking in my head, and with the stress and everything. My concept was a little more translucent with stiffness. >> you have five minutes. >> [Strangled cry] I'm going for something that, you know, was timeless and classy, and it's a classic take on a trench dress... Modernized and sexified. >> okay, everybody. That's it. Time. Thank you, mood. >> all: Thank you, mood. >> we'll be back. All right, designers... You have until midnight tonight, so plan on finishing tonight. And if you have some tweaking to do, you can do that in the morning. >> what I'm struggling with right now is the fact that I made the wrong fabric choices. I love polka dots. I love bright colors. So that's kind of what's hanging me up is I'm not moving outside of that comfort zone. I'm sitting right where I'm comfortable, and it's the same thing over and over. >> somebody messed up the tension in here yesterday. >> yeah. There's something wrong with this one. Wow, look at all these broken needles in here. Somebody's been going to town. I don't remember the last time I ever broke a needle. That's just--I don't remember. >> kristin--she's a little headstrong. I'm not gonna lie, like... She thinks that she is the [Bleep]. >> I wasn't gonna do contrast on my coat--I wanted to, but I figured if I do contrast then I make it look too Ann Taylor. I-I am super-torn, like I was... I'm going back and forth in my mind between like which color fabric... Think maybe I'll just use red piping...Or I mean, black I could, but I didn't get any black. White, maybe? So I'm a little nervous. >> the back shoulder is... It should be there. More up to the front than the front to the back. >> are you asking me? >> yes. >> if I--what do I think? >> like this, like this. >> I mean, no offense, I-- I'm not gonna help you pattern. Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm not. >> that's okay. >> I'm just not. I don't want to be rude, but I'm not gonna help you pattern. This is like--this got real serious today. You want like... >> no, no, no, that's okay. That's okay. I don't know what happened with a.J. I just asked simple question. I think he's very into the competition. I respect that. Most of the designer, they share the stuff, they learn. They make opinion. I don't--I don't take it personal. If this is the way he is, I'm cool. >> I'm not gonna sew it for you. >> coming up on Project Runway... >> what's this? I think it looks cheap. They look discordant. >> and I really don't care about what the other people think. They don't really interest me. >> I'm just baffled. >> our challenge is to design a look to advertise for Marie Claire on a billboard in times square and, uh, I'm really, really excited about it. >> how is everybody? >> fantastic. >> good. >> really? Valerie. >> hi, Tim. >> I'd love to hear what you're doing. >> I was thinking of a classic trench coat dress but... I'm having the skirt be fitted. >> I have to say, I really respond positively to that. >> I think Valerie's work is really incredible. >> where's your zipper? >> and I think she's my top competition. >> does it look too brassy? >> yeah, for me...I think it looks cheap. >> oh, gosh, Tim, that's the kiss of death. >> see? It is. >> no. >> so keep it clean. >> okay. I'll keep it clean. >> go, go, go, work, work, work. >> I am, I'm gonna cut away and get to sewing. >> Mondo. >> oh, hi, Tim. >> listen, before we start with this design, I have to tell you something. >> okay. >> the last challenge... >> uh-huh. >> I have never seen a designer take a matronly issue and make it modern so instantaneously as you did. >> I can be honest with you-- I was really, really worried about it. After the critique, I was feeling like I was gonna give up. >> oh, no, no, no-- and you didn't! And it was like...Pow! Anyway, you blew me away. >> thank you. >> so where are you with this? >> I'm making this simple two-tiered skirt. For the top, I was thinking about using this as a halter. >> you--you have a sketch? >> uh, no, it's all in my head. I don't have a sketch. >> all right, then I have to give you blind trust...Which, based on the last design, I'm willing to do. >> all right, thanks. >> thank you, Mondo. >> all right, bye-bye. >> Jason. Gorgeous colors. >> thank you. >> love your palette. >> it's going to come down like this, like an 8. >> so it's two sides of an 8... >> yeah. >> overlapping each other like a wrap? >> yeah, kind of. Like it's an infinity dress, like 8... Like for season 8 Project Runway. >> Jason's mysterious. I mean, he has like the bowler hat all clockwork orange, you know, but... As a designer, I am not a huge fan. >> what I'm trying to do is mix these colors--I want them to be striking. I don't know if I'm gonna go this intense, but if it's gonna be on a billboard, I think it has to really come out at you. And if I have the time, but I'm not gonna force it--I'm gonna finish one thing at a time-- I'm gonna maybe applique this over that, you know? >> what are those doing? >> like alien...Like croppings? >> all right. But I'm concerned about you, I'm gonna tell you right now. >> okay... >> I'm looking at our time. I'm looking at all these scraps. >> these are all perfectly cut pieces. >> but you need to put them together. >> yeah. >> if they don't see something that's superbly finished, they will not have the patience. >> I'm working one section at a time, so I'll get done. >> it's a lot of work. >> okay. >> do it. >> okay. I'll surprise you, I promise. >> all right, Jason, thank you. >> thank you. Everything's stacked against me. I'm a straight guy in a gay man's world, and I'm just trying my best here. I mean, what the [Bleep]? It's like, don't be so hard on me, man. >> first of all, congratulations on being the first designer to make the wall of fame. >> thank you! >> so now you have a tough act to follow. >> [Singsong] I know! This is, to be honest, the first pair of pants that I've ever made without somebody helping me. >> oh. Is that a good thing? >> yeah. I'm stoked. >> I think that Gretchen's talented, but the thing about Gretchen is she's not creative. >> and have you started the top? >> I know I can bang the top out. >> all right...Less than four hours. >> I know! >> okay, Gretchen, go, go, go. Thank you. >> thank you. >> Casanova. >> I'm doing something like sailor. >> sailor? I mean, you went from... >> prostitute to the virgin. >> to a nunnery. I mean, this is so matronly looking. I'm just baffled. Do you know what I'm talking about? >> no, no. >> Casanova is playing the card. We hear him speak perfect English in the workroom. So feel like it's a little bit of a front. >> the judges are going to be scratching their heads--this can't be the same designer. >> okay. >> all right, Casanova. Thank you. >> okay. Thank you. >> Nicholas, talk to me. >> what I wanted to do with challenge is, number one, how much I can accomplish and also how innovative I can be. >> excellent. >> and the back is my favorite. I think it's beautiful. >> mm-hmm. >> the top that Nicholas made has a striking similarity in the back to what I made yesterday. And I know that he thinks he made a lovely dress, but...He ripped me off. >> I feel like it's much more Nicholas. >> what's this? >> it's this concept of complete circle. And I'm able to drape it into like this form. Do you think that's not good, 'cause I was really excited about it. >> I'm ambivalent. Only because I think that there's a sexiness to this... >> yeah... >> whereas this--I mean, does she become little red riding hood? Keep working. >> thank you, Tim. >> thank you, Nicholas. >> Michael. >> I wanted to do a fabulous jacket. I got this in the bag. My jacket's the [Bleep]. It's beautiful. All these other bitches are going down. >> it really worries me. >> [Gasps] >> it's old, it's... Blanche devereaux. >> no! >> I don't know, I thought it was very fashion-forward and it's really gorgeous. >> fashion-forward? >> Michael's outfit looked a little bit too...Bedroom, not boardroom, so to speak. >> just think about these things. Carry on. >> how is Peach? >> I wanted to do a higher-waisted skirt and then a little bit of a wrap and then cover more in the back. And I see the look on your face. >> well, tell me what you're thinking. >> I'm lost. Absolutely lost. >> this and this--they look discordant. >> it seems like I need to start over with something. Now, do I start over with the skirt, or do I start over with the top? >> it's about what you would do and still stay true to who you are as a designer. The textile alone stays true to who you are-- >> oh, good God, it was screaming at me from the wall. >> yeah, see, it was calling your name. >> it was, but... >> singing you an operetta. >> yeah, but it's off-key now. >> well, it is...And at least you know that. >> I do know that. >> okay, Peach, I'm leaving you. Go, go, go. >> all right. [Laughter] All right, I'm starting over. >> what'd he say? >> the skirt was a disaster. >> what do you mean? >> so plan "b". I did exactly what he suggests and start over. Please don't, please don't. I appreciate it. >> I hope it doesn't look like a wedding dress. >> I'm gonna work in a little piece of the orange, and then I'm taking the mesh... So that it knocks it down so it's like a gradient. >> little scared about the orange. >> I love the orange. I think the orange is the best part. >> oh. >> do you think this is chic? >> I like the front. >> you don't like the back? >> you need to finish that. >> how are you holding up? >> me? >> yes. >> I don't know, I just hope I get [Bleep] Done, man, you know? >> I can't believe I didn't just leave that outfit alone. My Twist on a bubble skirt was not good. It's so not me, guys. So that went into the trash. All right, back to the beginning again. >> designers...As you all know, you're each creating a design that you hope will be photographed, blown up, and placed on a billboard in New York City. Needless to say, this reward is huge. So with this in mind, there is another element to this challenge. >> you know, it's gonna be like, "make another dress out of your scraps!" >> I think there's gonna be people that are gonna crack. >> oh...Crap! >> coming up on Project Runway... >> Gretchen, what do you think with that belt? >> what about Mondo? Where is he? >> I feel like this gift and talent is a curse to me sometimes. >> there is another element to this challenge. Tomorrow morning... You will each have a photo shoot with a Marie Claire photographer. >> yes! >> each of you. >> yes! >> I'm fine with that. I'm so fine with that. I'm pretty excited, because that's actually a fun thing. >> you will work with the photographer and your model to capture the image that you believe best represents your look and the Marie Claire woman. Furthermore, your judges will consider the image that you capture, along with your Runway presentation, when scoring your designs. So use the time between now and midnight very thoughtfully and very strategically. And I am sending in your models soon, all right? >> Tim's talking about this photo shoot that's gonna happen. And this is another thing I have to worry about. I'm gonna have less time to sew my garment. I'm not gonna get it done, and it's just sitting on my brain now. And it's like this baggage that's there. >> hi. >> see you tomorrow. >> I do too, but Tim hated it. Tim's always, like, hated my stuff. I don't know why. >> I need to do something different, like... >> yeah. That would be good. That would be "gooder." >> it's cool. We're gonna do something like this, you see? >> oh, that's cool. I like that. >> it just, like, unfolds, and you're gonna see the lining. So you get dressed. I'm gonna get sewing on this 'cause it's gonna be badass. >> I like with the belt. I like it. Gretchen, what do you think with that belt? No? I like with the belt. >> oh, awesome. We have plenty of room. Yes! I'm so excited. I feel good about it now. Okay, I can relax a little bit, but not really. >> Gretchen... >> Casanova could be incredibly annoying if he wasn't so charming. >> I need your advice. >> that's not bad. >> it's kind of... >> yeah. >> refreshing. >> it is refreshing. >> I like the... >> the polka dots, yeah. >> they're cute. >> Tim did not like it, so I started over, and then I came back to it. So we may be going home this week, dear. >> Peach started, I don't know, like, three dresses. She kept starting and stopping and starting and stopping-- three different ideas. >> this is pretty. >> so she was worried, and I was worried for her, 'cause she's my roommate. >> I know we're going home this week, and I apologize. >> we are not. >> I decided to call you my bosom buddy.Y. >> Gretchen? >> bosom. >> bosom? >> bosom--boobs-- buddy, 'cause we're close. But we're close like... >> hips buddies. >> all right, hips buddies. >> [Laughs] >> it's kind of nice to have people around you that you enjoy being with. And it's getting really hard to not form friendships. I thought Mondo was gonna be a chipper chatter. He is so quiet and so focused, you don't even know he's in the room. >> I'm happy with this. Are you guys happy with your pieces? >> I'm not gonna be happy until it's done. >> like, my top is all drapey, but my model's [Bleep] Are so big. >> very nice. Don't like big [Bleep]. >> I don't mind big [Bleep], but, like, hers are so big. >> whoa, Nellie! It's getting crazy up in here. >> it is not happening here. By the time the clock hits midnight, I am completely defeated. I was a maniac all day. And it's done. But I've got something on the dress form. And I have decided I'm going to get a little sleep and map out a plan to at least send something plan to at least send something down the Runway tomorrow. >> to a great workday, and... >> two more hours tomorrow! >> to not going home. >> I have the best roommates. Oh, my goodness, like, Gretchen, Ivy, and sarah-- we have the most fun. We're really different, but also really similar, and we talk for hours. >> all: Oh, my God! >> like, I'm having the time of my life. >> did anybody see where Jason is? He's just so quiet and kind of, like--everyone else, I feel like I kind of have a feel of, like, what they're about, both, like, aesthetically and personally a little bit. I'm starting to, like, feel it out. But, like, with him, I still don't have a clue. Jason's really aloof, and I'm not sure what his angle is yet. He seems a little Shady. >> I think we've all shared with each other a little bit about ourselves. >> and he doesn't share anything with anybody. >> you know, it is what it is. I have had the best time. This has been so surreal for somebody like me. >> stop talking about it like you're gonna leave. Stop. >> my only hope is that they take mercy on the old lady. >> hey, let's have a toast. Well, what about Mondo? >> he's having some. >> where is he? >> I'm really lonely, and I need to connect with somebody. And there hasn't been a connection with anybody, to tell you the truth. And I think so many thoughts in my own head, and they're starting to beat me up. >> I hope Mondo has earplugs, dude. >> we'll see him tomorrow. >> right. >> [Voice breaking] I feel like I've never been loved for just who I am and what I can give back. It's just always what I can create as an artist. I feel like this gift and talent is a curse to me sometimes. >> congratulations and anything else. >> to being alive. >> coming up on Project Runway... >> wing it. Yeah. >> it looks like she's got a stomachache. >> the photo shoot is a little intimidating. >> that's feeling a bit weird to me. >> what did you tell her to do? >> aah! >> lighten it up a bit. >> so what do you think about finishing and then going to the Runway? >> I just hope we'll have enough time to finish. This morning we have a photo shoot with Marie Claire. I still have to do another fitting with the model. And we have hair and makeup. Uhhhhh! >> I'm really nervous. >> are you scared you're gonna go home? >> yeah. I think my biggest problem is that I'm trying so hard to think about what the judges are gonna think. I feel like a lot of people use more color, and it's a lot more editorial than mine. >> yeah. >> but I did have the attention to detail. The winner for this is going to get a billboard in Times Square, which is huge. Do you know how many millions of people pass through Times Square every day? >> your personality, your charm, your defense, your styling will totally win all. >> I just really need to stay centered and stay focused and believe in myself. >> clearly I don't think I'm going home. My bed looks like a disaster. I've moved in. >> I'm not ready to go home, but i'm not ready for the Runway either. >> yesterday was such a stressful day. Coming into this, I always told myself that I would roll with the punches. This morning when I woke up, it was a clean slate. And I'm gonna continue to do my best and stay true to myself. >> come on, you guys, let's go. >> here we come, Parsons. >> I think I'm gonna try to cut this necklace apart. But we've got not a lot of time to pick everything out and get everything together. It's a little crazy. Everything together. >> good morning, designers. >> all: Good morning, Tim. >> how is everyone? >> great. >> you should be great. I'm about to send in your models. You will have two hours to send them to the l'oreal Paris makeup room and the garnier hair salon. Remember, this is the Marie Claire photo shoot. >> Whoo! >> this is your opportunity to show the judges an enhanced view of what they see on the Runway. Think about that when you're using the piperlime accessory wall. It's about attitude. It's about your point of view as a designer. It's about the attitude of the whole look. All right? Editorial, everyone. Got it? >> all: Got it. >> okay. >> how's it going? >> it's going good. I want to get done. >> it's a little big? It doesn't look big, that's the thing, 'cause I want you to be able to move in it. >> I'm feeling okay this morning. The garments will be finished, and I can have time to style Cassie without having to, like, worry about time at all, really. >> yeah. >> I think maybe the bangles are a bit much, dude. >> you think so? >> yeah, 'cause she's already looking a little punk, you know, and it's Marie Claire. >> I've been asking certain people what they think. >> I would say no earrings and just keep the clutch, shoes, and belt. >> 'cause I just can't figure out what I want to do. >> take them off. I'm back and forth here. I've noticed that my best work comes out when I really just go with my gut and follow my heart. I like the earrings. Whatever, I like them. >> hello. >> hi. >> hi. Tell me. >> hi. So this is the dress. >> gorgeous. >> since the dress is pretty strong and bold, neutral lip-- maybe a little matte. Maybe just darken the eyebrows so that they're, like, strong. >> very velvet, red lips. >> gorgeous. >> really gloss the eye, but with this kind of coloring. >> taupe-y... >> taupe. >> I just want her to look like a latina bombshell, like, super exaggerated cat eye. >> I'm gonna dab over this with a little bit of eye shadow. >> that--I love that. Yeah, thank you. >> so what are we doing? >> so I want to do, like, a fishtail up in the back. And then I want to do a bun on top of her head, about the same area where mine is. >> well, what I wanted to do with her is Hollywood glamour, like dita Von teese--kind of like that wavy, controlled up. >> because she's blonde, she'll be a little more Marilyn than she will be dita. >> that's o--yeah, exactly. Exactly. I think that'll be nice. >> okay. >> okay. >> we have what, five minutes? The only redeeming thing i have right now is the fact that, you know, ify is covered. And covered is good, but she's covered with Barbie's sofa. >> designers and models, time is up. You're going to the photo shoot. So follow me. >> so I ran out of time, and i put the safety pins, which was my backup plan, to where the buckles were. >> what does this piece do? Is it a pocket? Oh, flaps. >> it's the infinity. It's the eight. If you look at it, the dress is an eight. >> I see it. Yeah. Jason's kind of creepy, so you never know if he's gonna come behind you with the scissors and just, like, boom! So I try to be friends with him. Like, "yeah, I love what you're doing. Oh, I get the whole infinity thing, yeah." >> it's a part of my process. >> it looks like the infinity symbol. [Humming psycho theme] >> come on in. Hi, a.J. I'm zanna from Marie Claire. >> zanna, nice to meet you. >> how are you? This is mark, our photographer. >> how you doing? >> I'm really excited to get to work with zanna. She's someone who will be able to give me some cool feedback, and we'll get to do some really cool things to show off the dress and the accessories i picked out, 'cause I feel really good about those. >> obviously, feel free to direct. >> make it work. >> I like the arms down and then just kind of, like... I think it's really important to show how our looks will look in an editorial ad. Yeah, that's great. That's perfect. >> it seems like her hands are coming a little close together almost. >> it looks like she's got a stomachache. >> I feel like his work looks like student work. He's only 23, and I feel like he does too much. He doesn't know how to pull back. >> okay. Great. Perfect. Good. >> be loose with your bag maybe. >> do, like, a jump. >> there you go. Great. >> we're gonna do ten with it on and then ten with it off. >> entirely your call. >> maybe, like, with one leg up or something. I'm feeling really confident and comfortable. Now I'm just nervous of capturing the right shot. You can see the silhouette on her side and the back of it. I'm going with 173. >> so what was the main direction here? >> a powerful businesswoman. >> Valerie's dress had a really cool architectural shape. And I feel like she had the sense of futurism, and I like that. >> she's a vice provost/dean. So she's pretty serious. >> you're kind of excited. Maybe you have a date. You're gonna go have some fun now. >> we don't want to make it too cutesy by a big smile. >> not as much smile. I got nothing from her. Again, not so flat. >> yeah. >> there's no personality. There's no fire. There's no effort. I had given up on the photo by then. >> sophisticated. >> elegant and sophisticated. >> elegant and sophisticated. >> great. [Camera shutter clicks] >> act like you were naturally walking, somebody calls your name--you're, like, "oh. Who's that?" Eyen. Great. Good. >> Mondo is definitely wackadoo, but it works for him. >> while I was scrolling through the HP touchsmart, I knew exactly what photograph I wanted to choose. 123. >> well done. >> tell me a little bit about this dress. >> it could be styled in so many different ways. And that's why I have the user-friendly safety pins. >> it's not working. It looks like a mistake or a hole in the dress. >> Jason's dress didn't really make a lot of sense to me. The entire look seemed so far away from Marie Claire. >> what kind of, like, feeling are we trying to get? >> like, the tough look. >> Marie Claire isn't so much of a tough magazine. It's feeling a bit weird to me. >> absolutely, yeah. Lighten it up a bit. Let's see what you think. >> I like this. This one. >> so jason--307. Any tiny flaw is magnified by hundreds on a screen like that. But then imagine it being on the billboard as well. >> I know. >> it's just, like-- it would be glaring. >> the judges have to look past these little closures, because I'm not prototype Jack. I can't pop things out. It's emotionally draining and physically draining. >> coming up on Project Runway... >> is that a "walk of shame" dress? >> desperate housewives. Oh! >> what are you doing now? Are you showing us her underwear? >> welcome to the Runway. As you know, in fashion, one day you're in, and the next day you're out. There are 16 of you here, and after tonight, there will be 15... Or less. Your challenge was to create a look that defines the Marie Claire woman. The winning look will be featured on a billboard campaign in New York's Times Square. You also had the opportunity to work with your model on a photo shoot. And since this challenge has such a big payoff, no one will receive immunity. >> oh-ho-ho. >> you had $150 and one day to put it together. All right, let's meet the judges. First, we have cfa lifetime achievement award winner Michael kors. >> hey, guys. >> hi. >> fashion director from Marie Claire magazine, Nina Garcia. >> hi, everyone. >> hello. >> and our guest judge today, editor in chief of Marie Claire magazine, Joanna Coles. >> hi, everyone. >> hi, Joanna. >> we will score your designs as they come down the Runway, and we will also take your photos into account. One of you will be named the winner... And one of you will be out. All right, let's start the show. >> I'm so confident in this look right now. I think she looks amazing. And she pulls off the cloak, and it's like, bam, there's the look. But I notice that, you know, the judges don't really look as impressed as I look. >> I'm really happy with how my piece turned out. I think it's so beautiful. I definitely think they're gonna see that I know what I'm doing. >> I think I stumbled upon something. It was impeccable the way it was sewn. She looks really badass. She's rockin' out the look. >> I'm happy with what I've created. I love the whole look together. I think it's working. I think the judges are going to like it, and I feel confident about it. >> when I see my dress go down the Runway, my immediate thought is that it looks like amare was impregnated by some weird alien creature. And it really, really worries me. I'm happy with the concept of my overall work. However, I don't feel like my execution was up to my standards. So I'm a little worried. >> two hours ago, I was done. I was standing there with a naked model. Right now I'm very pleased with what I made-- a tailored-to-perfection little dress. I'm thinking I can hold my own here for a while. >> when I see my dress, I think I'm going to die, because I just can't believe it is so short. It should be a rap video. I'm just going to use my poker face. I'm not gonna have any expression, 'cause I know Nina is watching me right now. >> I'm happy with the entire look. Ekaterina totally worked it, so I am happy with that. However, in the back of my mind, I'm still thinking, "you just never know who could get sent home, no matter how good you think you are." >> everything always translates differently on the Runway. And my dress on the Runway really looks fantastic. I mean, I really like my dress on the model and in person, but on the Runway, it's magnified times ten. It just beams. >> I felt pretty confident. The main thing that I worry about, as far as, like, the judges are concerned, was my color choices. I feel like it came across pretty well on the Runway. >> I am looking at the judges' faces. They're hard to read, but I feel really good. I feel really confident that I could be in the top three on this challenge. When she does her little fanning out of the sleeves, that was so fun, and I think it was really interesting for the judges to see, because I don't think they were expecting it. And I think that's what will keep me in the top is being unexpected and being interesting. >> I think my model looks awesome--stunning on the Runway. Like, the sleeve--amazing. She handle, like, everything very nice. But I'm a little bit concerned about the color of the top. I really don't like Navy. I don't know why I decide that disturbing color. >> at first, I was nervous about the fit on my model, 'cause I could not work that fabric the way I wanted to work it. But when she walked down that Runway, she sold it. >> I felt so good looking at my piece coming down the Runway. Alexandra is my dream girl, and seeing how the styling all came together... And getting to look over at the judges and how they were looking at it... It was like magic. >> when I see the dress walk down the Runway, I wasn't as nervous. I see my skirt as this fun, flirty garment, and eyen is doing a great job walking down the Runway and showing the judges the bounce and the energy that it has. >> as I watch my garment go down the Runway on millana, I think that it looks great. I'm super confident. And it's really who I am as a designer, but still keeping the challenge in the consideration. Overall, I'm not worried. There's definitely a few people that deserve to be in the bottom tonight, and it's definitely not me. >> if I call your name, please step forward. Mondo... Peach... Nicholas... Please step forward. Jason... Valerie... Gretchen. If I have not called your name, congratulations. Your scores have qualified you to move on to the next challenge. You can leave the Runway. Thank you. >> oh, [Bleep]. >> [Gasps] I know, I know, it's just... >> you're just so excited. >> ooh, no, no, I mean, like... When I got called safe, I was just thinking that this is the one time I'm getting off the hook. So I started to lose it for a minute. >> the rest of you represent the highest and the lowest scores. One of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be out. Okay, let's bring out your models. >> Valerie's out there right now, and honestly, I have a feeling that she's gonna take this one home, and she's gonna be the winner. >> Valerie's screams billboard. >> who do you think is gonna be out? >> I think Nicholas. >> Nicholas. >> Nicholas is, like, the sweetest guy ever, but, like, his finishing is just always really rough. >> how about Peach? >> ooh! She's got, like, major fit issues. >> she still styled it a lot cuter than, like, Jason's combat boots and his thing opening up and everything. >> so not Marie Claire, right? >> no. I don't know what that was. >> I feel like those safety pins are, like, coffin nails. >> I've seen some of his menswear, and he's a very, very talented-- >> I think it would be so unfair if Jason goes home. >> Peach, tell us about your look. >> I think polka dots are youthful and happy. And I was thinking polka dots for the billboard, because I thought it would be eye-catching. >> when I think about Marie Claire, I think about a woman that is strong, powerful, fashion-forward, hip. When I look at this, I don't see any of those things. This looks like ladies at lunch. There is no sex appeal. >> it's like an amish cocktail dress. >> [Laughs] Oh, no. >> I think you really have to watch the sophistication. >> I don't think it looks young at all. On top of it, the styling doesn't really help you. She's got, you know, a lady bun and the pumps. It just looks very matronly, very cliche. >> my notes said it looks like there's an animal climbing down the back. >> can we have a look at this animal? >> I added the brown pleating just to give it a little texture. I definitely struggled. This is my third dress. >> so you made two complete dresses before? >> two skirts and a top and then these two in the time allotment. >> wow, so you can make a lot in a day. >> I can work fast. >> Valerie, tell us about your look. >> I was very inspired by the Marie Claire woman, and I wanted to really embody the spirit of New York as well. So I wanted to create something that was innovative, but still simple and elegant--kind of Carrie bradshaw meets Samantha Jones. >> I think it would be beautiful in the picture. There's enough detail to make it interesting. It's sexy, yet conservative, which is hard to do. The collar is very beautiful, and it will frame a shot very nicely. >> you've kind of managed to have a good balance going on-- that it has simplicity, but it has interest. And red on a billboard--smart choice. I think it's a job very well done. >> thank you. >> for a woman to wear red is always very powerful. Joanna is wearing red. She's very powerful. >> very, very powerful. I like the way you talked about it. It made me think that you'd really thought about it. >> yes. >> I think it's great. >> thank you very much. >> Jason. >> I wanted to make a look that transcended from night to day. And what I started with was infinity. It's an eight here. And I think it's edgy and youthful, and I'm really happy with it. >> I don't know how interesting this would be on a billboard. Are the closures safety pins? >> yes. >> and that was intentional, obviously. >> that was intentional. >> I don't think that the Marie Claire girl would wear it for day or night. At night, she would feel like she was wearing a satin bedspread. For day, everyone in the office would say, "is that a 'walk of shame' dress?" >> [Chuckles] >> you know, "did you just come in?" >> I think she looks furious that she's being put up in Times Square. And I can't believe that you would pick a photo where it's very clear that the hole in the middle is not supposed to be there. We can't see it now, so it's clearly not part of the design. I don't think I've met a single woman in America that would go into an office with that in the middle. I mean, it's just not gonna happen. >> after you even heard all of that, do you still think that this is Marie Claire? >> I think it's me for Marie Claire. If I had the snaps and everything, there are all different ways that you'd be able to wear this. >> what are you doing now? Are you showing us her underwear? >> no, no, I'm showing you what could be done--what options could be done with this. >> but that's the problem. It's like how it should have, could have, would have been that we can't see, you know? >> I understand. >> Gretchen, tell us about your look. >> I felt like it was really important to create something that would fill the page because it's a billboard. It's advertising. A woman that's as young as 22 would want to be this woman, as well as somebody way into their 40s and 50s. I'm not sure if you guys noticed my day-to-evening look. >> she looks like a cool girl. I also love this photo. It's really simple, sophisticated. And I love that you can open the front and kind of... Reveal a little bit more, if you like. >> she's a modern girl from her head to her toes. I think the other thing that's cool about it is it's almost like a piece of sportswear. You could wear a turtleneck under it. You could wear a tank top under it. And her hair and makeup is spot-on perfect. >> I like the effortless ease with which she wears it. It looks easy. Her hair's easy. And in the picture, she just looks great. >> the Marie Claire woman is smart. She's confident. She's modern, and she likes to have fun. These are all things that I get out of this outfit. >> thank you. >> okay, Nicholas. >> the idea was to take this 27-inch-diameter circle and create, like, this really nice shape around her. >> there's too many details-- the seams of the skirt, plus the cape, then the asymmetry of the blouse. This is a billboard. It's supposed to be arresting-- simple, but beautiful. This is very complicated. You did not really think about the big picture--and I mean literally the big picture-- of this challenge. >> I think it's utterly unsexy. I can't imagine a modern, young woman who would want to wear it. >> obviously, when you went to go take the picture, realized that the cape is unphotographable. She's got it in her hand. And the only garment that works is the blouse. >> maybe we should just get rid of this cape for a second and have a look at what was pretty. With the blouse, you did a nice job. >> can we see the back? >> oof, the back without the cape is a little bit strange, yeah? >> it was my idea of, like, the daytime to, like, evening. >> so she has to wear the cape all day? >> well, I guess not all day. [Laughter] >> that's a rough one, 'cause she takes the cape off, she's naked. And if she keeps the cape on, she might be joining a religious sect. >> Mondo, tell us about your look. >> I wanted to create something that was young and flirty with a touch of whimsy, but still practical. >> it's really cool. And I think that this would stop you in your tracks. Also, you know, in the picture, I think it has something. >> I was kind of thinking about the opening credits for Mary Tyler moore and just how cute she was. So I just wanted her to, like, go on lunch and be noticed walking down the street. >> oh, I love that you said Mary Tyler Moore inspired you, because, actually, Mary Tyler Moore is why I moved to America. In the picture, it has energy. It has bounce. It has confidence. It feels professional, but not corporate. >> thank you so much. >> I like the graphicness of the black and white, and I love her little shoes with the ruffles. It has a great spirit. >> I just want you to know this is the first time Nina and I have ever agreed. [Laughter] >> I think a lot of girls are gonna say, "wow." You know, "I like her. I want to meet her." >> thanks. >> okay, we've heard what you had to say. We're gonna have a little chat, and then we'll call you back. You can leave the Runway. >> hey! >> hi. >> hey, guys. >> what about your critique? >> it didn't go too good. >> not too good? >> no. They didn't understand the concept, so that's really it. I think they thought maybe, like, it looked too tough. And I don't know. I have to work with the model I'm given. I think she's a beautiful girl, but she's not a Runway model. >> that's just an excuse. I feel like you could just-- >> I don't make excuses. >> you are making an excuse. >> you're blaming the girl. >> no, no, no, I'm really not. I'm really not. My whole life I have had a chip on my shoulder, because I have been misunderstood since I was a child. And I really don't care about what the other people think, because they don't really interest me. >> all right, let's talk about the designs that we did like. Mondo tells a story. It's definitely a different kind of eye-catcher. For a poster, I think it would be also cool. >> I love the exuberance of his look. You know, it had movement, which, of course, on a billboard is great. I like the idea that it was tweed-handled in a very feminine way. It had real confidence, which I think is very Marie Claire. >> yeah, and it was whimsical-- slightly eccentric, in a good way. >> it wasn't this pose-y old, you know... >> like a bad catalog. >> right. >> let's talk about Gretchen. That would look amazing on a billboard. >> there was something about it that I thought was very sophisticated, but it wasn't old. And that's a really tricky thing to hit. And it had no season, no age. And the photograph was fantastic. >> she really has a modern aesthetic. >> we also liked Valerie's dress. >> she managed to find a way to do something that was sexy without being vulgar. >> mm-hmm. >> it's very much a cover dress. >> yeah. >> right, absolutely. It frames her face. It's perfect. >> she looked fabulous in it. She looked confident. She looked sexy. It's just one of those dresses that you love to go to. It's like a really good friend. >> all right, let's move on to the designers that we didn't like. Let's start with Jason. >> oh, gosh. >> [Chuckles] >> well-- >> he just has strange ideas. >> I think that any designer who has to have a disclaimer with everything that they design... You know, the clothes should really speak for themselves. The picture was terrible. We got the peekaboo belly button. >> so unflattering. >> how could he remotely think it was sexy? Has he ever spoken to a woman? >> I think, honestly, it was only about that figure eight. >> I do like messages as an afterthought, but if that's the selling point, then it's... Not good. Let's talk about Nicholas. >> well, I feel like he was so overly ambitious. And each piece had something wrong with it. You know, I actually thought the blouse was pretty, and then she turned around. >> yeah, that scared me too. There was an entire hole in the back. >> I didn't notice that either before. >> I think he thought, "oh, I'll sauce it up." >> "I'll give her a cape instead of a jacket." >> right. "I'm gonna make her edgy." >> but I think he really tried. He just went crazy with the detailing, and it didn't work. >> it might have been nice if the blouse did not look like the back was eaten. >> well, yes. >> maybe the model's too thin, and she just ate her outfit. I don't know. But something definitely was a disaster here. >> okay, let's talk about Peach. >> [Sighs] >> desperate housewives. Oh! >> no, it's full Stepford wife. When you talk about demographics of who reads the magazine, it's either way too young or way too old. I mean, you would either have to be 11 or 70. >> 70--with that styling, the hairdo? >> the neckline. >> the pearl earrings, the pumps. >> that thing cascading down her back... That wasn't good. >> she thought that was the cool, edgy part of the dress. >> it was just distracting. The only thing I have to say, though... It's well made. >> yeah. But still, Peach could have made it a little bit more youthful. >> yeah, it's hopeless. I mean, it's completely wrong for what we wanted her to do. >> okay, the question is now, how many people do we want to get rid of today? Let's bring them back out. The six of you represent the best and the worst. One of you will be named the winner, and one of you will be out. >> one of you will be named the winner... And one of you will be out. Mondo, we loved your Mary Tyler Moore reference. It made us smile and captured the spirit, the energy, and confidence of your design. Good job. You're in. You can leave the Runway. >> thank you. >> well? >> it went well, but I'm not the winner. >> all: Oh. >> it's all good. The day before, I was feeling quite defeated. But I made it into the top three, so I am so, so, so, so happy. It just validated everything. It feels good. I'm enjoying the moment. [Laughter] >> Gretchen, your design was urban, seasonless, modern, and fun. Your photograph showed the potential of your design representing Marie Claire on a big billboard. Valerie, your red dress was flirty and fun, but yet sophisticated. It embodied the Marie Claire woman. The combination of dress, styling, and photo worked and made your dress memorable. Gretchen... Congratulations. You're once again the winner of this challenge. >> thank you so much. Thank you very much. >> you can leave the Runway. >> I felt really grateful and really prideful. >> hey. >> she won. >> I won. I have won two challenges, and i've set a bar that people maybe weren't expecting. >> everything's gonna be huge! >> literally. I'm stoked about the billboard. I think that's awesome. All I know is it's gonna be in Times Square. >> that is awesome. >> I think Gretchen is one of the best designers in the room. She's definitely my competition. >> I just want you all to know that, like, I really appreciate the support. >> [Mockingly] I'm so proud of you, Gretchen! I really am! But I thought Valerie should win. >> Valerie... You're in. You can leave the Runway. >> thank you. [Cheers and applause] >> girl, we knew you were coming back. >> oh, yeah. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. I do feel a little defeated. You know, like, I'm kind of like... To kind of, like, get so close, and then it's like you just missed it. It just sucks. >> Nicholas... Peach... And Jason... We had major problems with your looks. Jason, we were hoping to see something different from you this week, something more impressive. But again, we got an unfinished mess with lots of excuses from you. Peach, we were split whether your dress was too junior or too country club matronly. But the bad news is, either way, we did not like it. Nicholas, you tried to do way too many things with your design. Unfortunately, the blouse, skirt, and cape failed. Peach... You're safe for today. You can leave the Runway. >> thank you. I heard you all. >> Peach... >> are you here? >> come on. [Cheers and applause] >> mom's back! >> I knew that you weren't going anywhere. >> thank you so much. >> Jason... I'm sorry. You're out. Auf wiedersehen. >> thank you. >> take care. >> I came here, and I gave it my best and did everything I could. >> all: Hey. >> heyguys, looks like I'm out. >> like, sit down for real. >> no, no, I really can't stay. I gotta go. >> you can't just, like, walk the [Bleep]. Like, you have to wait. >> no, I don't have to wait for anything. >> okay. >> good luck, guys. I'm holding my head up high. I don't think it was a good depiction of my design aesthetic or style. But, you know, it's a challenge. I knew it would be from the start. >> after his elimination, i didn't have that moment to say, "bon chance." >> Nicholas... I'm sorry. You're out too. Auf wiedersehen, Nicholas. All the best to you. >> thank you. [Voice breaking] I didn't think I was gonna go home today. I really didn't. I'm just really sad. I just feel kind of disappointed in myself a little bit. [Sniffles] I have to go home. >> all: Oh. >> Nicholas... >> come here. Come here, come here, come here, come here. [Nicholas sobbing] >> hey, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, you know, come on, at least you made it here. And you have really good ideas. >> I was really scared for Nicholas going into the competition. It was really sad to see him go. I love you. >> you've got a lot to go back to. >> it's just not that easy to see it that way right now. >> well, right. >> that was a rough Runway. We're gonna miss you. I feel sick about this. We will see more from Nicholas, but it will be after the show. >> come here, baby. My buddy. You okay? Be so proud of yourself, okay? Be proud of yourself. >> good-bye. Wow, I'm shocked that there were two people sent home tonight. It definitely makes me think that this is real. Someone is going to be sent home every week. >> oh, my gosh. >> I'm just gonna miss being here. It's been really tiring and hard, and it's really tough. But it's really worth it, even if you're only here a short time like I was. >> I'm lucky enough to go to the Marie Claire photo shoot for the billboard. When I got there, the model was coco rocha. Ooh! >> congratulations. >> thank you. James macari, the photographer-- you could tell that he was just gonna knock it out. [Gasps] Oh, my God! >> oh, my God! Gretchen! >> I think any fashion designer that's, you know, a girl like me, coming from nothing, that's what you dream of. I'm experiencing my dreams coming true. [Tearfully] My mom's gonna be so proud. And it made me feel like this isn't the last time I'll be able to feel this way, which was really cool. >> next time on Project Runway... Tim is gonna throw a little party for you. >> I love the unconventional challenges. >> I'm not able to make a dress with bull[Bleep]. >> aah! >> this is atrocious. This is not cute. >> did you not listen to me? >> I don't get the point. >> can I talk for a minute? >> you talk all the time. I'm not gonna argue with you tonight. Alright it looks like a hot mess. Well her piñata exploded. I don't... Yeah I'm just really scared, for her. -- Sync by elderman -- -- for www.addic7ed.com --
