 United States of Tara (2009â€“2011): Season 1, Episode 5 - Revolution - full transcript 
 Depressed and unhappy then ever over losing her job and being ostracized by the neighborhood, things turn from bad to worse when Tara suddenly turns into her teenage personality 'T' and steals her own car to go on a joyride. While Max and Charmaine chase off after her, Marshall is left at home alone, and he decides to throw a huge party to hopefully win the affections of his schoolmate Jason. Also, Kate blows off her ex-boyfriend, Benjamin, when he shows up at the party with his latest girlfriend, resulting in Kate spending some quality time with her boss, Gene. Max tries to find out which one of Tara's alters destroyed Tiffany's mural and suspects it was 'T', but she denies doing it.

 (max) tiffany thinks one of your alters broke into her place in the middle of the night. I'm the only one who has her key. Are you tara gregson? (charmaine) it's not just the restraining order. I'm banned from selling vita-self products. You just ruin everything. [Contemplative music] * * * Open up the sky * * This mess is getting high * * It's windy, and our family needs a ride * * * * I know we'll be just fine * * When we learn to love the ride * * * * I know we'll be fine * * When we learn to love the ride * * * * I know we'll be just fine * * When we learn to love * * The ride * [Hip-hop music plays] I'm telling you, man, tupac is alive. I just saw him eating huevos Down at the pancake place in prairie village. (kate) what are you doing? Oh, yes, I did. I thought maybe I could find some kind of clue About, you know, who ruined mom's mural On one of these videos. Now lookity-look who's dead. Now would be your window to say something disparaging About me being very nancy drew or mrs. Marple-esque. It's too early. tara made a new friend. Tiffany was a threat to the system. So one of the alters was jealous? And wanted to be out in the world too. I know this is scary, but it's what we wanted. Not to just tolerate your parts, But to really get to know them. So that we'll get to the truth of what happened to you. It's just one of your alters showing A side we've never seen. Great, now my alters have alters. It was me. Oh, yeah? Yeah. So, uh, you snuck over to tiffany's In the middle of the night? Okay. And what did you use to scratch "Die yuppie cunt" in the wall? Um, my ferocious nails. Remember to pour with confidence. Well, the restraining order says whichever one did it Used mom's exacto knife. So we're looking for the alter That's the biggest dumbass. Pretty much. Oh, crud! (dr. Ocean) everybody has aggression. Most women don't have a clue How much they're carrying, Which is totally understandable. We're not encouraged to express it, And we don't have societally sanctioned outlets For aggression built in to our daily lives like men do. Max doesn't. Sure, I do. I play basketball. I'm gonna go out on a limb here, And just say that, with our situation, It might not be enough. Maybe it was aunt charmaine. Another pitiful, yet over-the-top grab for-- Shh! Listen. When people see who I really am, It's gonna change everything. I can't imagine alice scratching up somebody's wall. No way. I guess it could be buck. But he'd be more inclined to write "Sit on my face with your yuppie cunt." [Laughs] Not just my life, but the lives around me people are gonna talk about this for a long time. Please, my money's on t. Interesting. come on. She's devious. We know she's insecure. So when you see what I'm capable of, You're gonna know That I got super powers, bitches! [Laughs] [Flatulence] [buck laughing] Like how you always recognize stuff, Even if tara wasn't around. Yeah, maybe I don't remember alice making Chicken with corn flakes, But when you or one of the kids tell me, I can feel it's true. Like, somewhere in another room in my head That I'm not privy to. Yeah, I get that. I can see it kind of click with you. Yeah, but with this, there's no click. I have no feeling for it. And I would take responsibility, honestly. But I just don't think it was me. Really? Maybe it was tiffany's ex-husband. Maybe it was somebody who was really, really pissed 'Cause they couldn't lose weight. Come on, is there some way it's not me? I guess there's some way. You don't really believe that. You think I did it. You're my husband. Aren't you supposed to believe me? Come on, honey. We're late. All right, let's just talk about this later, When I see you. [Sighs] (woman on radio) they only are able to dispense these particular medications once a month. this has devastated an already overpopulated-- Fucking npr. [Engine revs] They're on their way. Just another five minutes. How'd you kill it? It's not dead yet. Max said he'd take a look. Hey, tara, where are you going? Don't you have something at marshall's school? [Engine starts] [Muffled hip-hop music] t? Whoo-hoo! Hi, max. Yeah, it's me. She's back. No, I'm glad you were there. Charmaine, any chance I could convince you To help me wrangle her? What's in it for you? I don't know. Free junk food, and, uh, good karma, I guess. Thank you. Listen, I gotta go. Bye. Listen, your mom's fine. She, uh-- She's just not quite herself. She went awol? I'm pretty sure she's at that arcade place she likes. You should go get her. No, no, no. I'm not gonna do that. You're gonna be wiggling your foot The whole trial anyway. No. Just go. [Sighs] Okay, all right. Thanks. Oh, I hate fremont. I don't know why she can't find a sugar shack Closer than 200 miles. Ah, it'd take all the fun out of it. I was thinking about tara and her friends. You know if she had a roommate at boarding school? Somebody that might have been around, you know, When whatever happened happened? I think so. She didn't mention it? Well, I asked, but I think my wanting to know Just puts her on edge. Yeah, I know. Oh, you know? You know she told me to also get a hobby Other than fixing her? We were going round and around about that. She said "train set." I thought maybe line dancing. She did have a roommate. I can't remember her name. I remember she was freakishly tall. Of course I was only worthy of shitty public school, so-- Why's that? I don't know. I don't know what I did. Maybe you didn't do anything. [Engine starts] Maybe. [Electronic dance music] * * [Chatter and cheers] [Music continues] * * [Cheers] * * She's pretty good. My bitch is fresh. [Cheers] Come on. [Cell phone vibrating] Hi, dad. Did you find her? Yes, I have, and she's not even in any trouble. yet. you haven't let her out of your sight, have you? No, sir. I have not, sir. hey, I think we're gonna stay over, okay? All right, bye. Roger. Oh, yeah, I'll take you bitches anytime. I wanna have a party. What? They're staying over. You just wanna have a party So that that jason guy comes over. No. I've always wanted to have a party. You hate parties. Parties with teenagers. I mean, I'd go to woody allen's new year's eve party, Or, you know, if noel coward Invited me to something on his boat. Sorry, moosh, but jason's not gonna come. How do you know? Because, it'd be too big of a statement. It would show he's actually into you. Maybe it'd just show, you know, that he likes parties. Civilized parties, like mine will be. [Laughs] But I guess I can make some phone calls. Thank you. So her footwork's all sloppy, and she dares me to sight read. And I'm like, "pfft, step-off, bar-humper, Here comes my bong thomas." And then I did a double on this nine-footer, And was, like, totally in challenge mode. Why's she here? Well, 'cause she's a nice person, And she's offered to drive tara's car back. So I can get up early, and go to my job at the clinic, Because your actions don't only affect you, You self-absorbed pretend teenager. What about me? We're gonna stay over. No shit? Yeah, let's hang out, have some fun. Why not? What kind of fun? Okay, bye. No. [Laughing] Why are we gonna stay over if we're not gonna fuck? Drive safe, charmie. Can I at least fuck him? No. You never let me do anything. You know, I think tara's roommate's name Was heidi troy, or heidi sawyer maybe. Does that help? Yeah, yeah. You bet. All right. Okay, thank you. [Electronic dance music] I've been collecting for quite some time now. I started on or around christmas when I was eight. It's, like, a peppermint schnapps party?
