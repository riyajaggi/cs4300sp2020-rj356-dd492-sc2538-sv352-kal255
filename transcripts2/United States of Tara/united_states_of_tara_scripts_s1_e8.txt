(man) seven pounds it is. there ya go. Kendra gave me the money. Ugh, I hate okra. Well have you ever had it? Excuse me. No. Why not? Sounds like oprah. Wouldn't want that in a can. So you don't like it because of the label? Want me to... I hate labels. Have you ever thought about what it would be like If--if there were no labels on anything in the store? Pretty random basically. Yes, okay. So people would take the stuff home And they would make it and eat it Before they even knew if they liked it or not. And I bet a lot of people would throw out A bunch of stuff that sucked. And I assert that the same amount of people If not more would find new things. New things that they loved. But you know what I mean, right? kind of. Okay, here we go. No! Alice, come on! Don't spray me with that stuff! I promise it'll cheer you up.

That man was a real pooh head for firing you. Right? Mm-hmm. But there's something you may want to consider. You know how we were brought up To believe that men were the stronger sex Made of hard, hairy muscles And granite and irish spring? Did she just say "hard, hairy muscles?" "Hairy muscles." And ladies are supposed to be These mushy crybabies With sparkly pink insides? Well it turns out that men... Are highly emotional creatures. We must never humiliate them. They are vulnerable and needy. And their hearts are just as pink and mushy as ours, If not pinker and mushier. Ew. And scientists have found that most men Feel safer and stronger... When women raise their vocal tones By just half a note. Is that why you talk like a disney princess? This is some bullshit, alice. I'm not gonna chirp like a hummingbird. Mm-mm-mm. Trust me, ladies. I know of what I speak. Now look at yourselves. Don't we feel like we can do anything? I look good. (max) I never had apricot pancakes before. they're good. I'm going to put some of those apricots Up in jars so when fiona's born, I'm going to make baby food. fiona? Is that what you're calling her now? Mm, I'm also considering marybeth and ellodie Ellodie? Never heard that one before. I made it up. [Giggles] You know when baby comes, The rest are gonna have to get used To not being number one anymore. What, do you mean kate and marshall? No, silly, the others. My charges, buck and t. What do you mean, "your charges?" They belong to you? Well somebody has to take care of the brood. T's a flake And buck's a high plains wolf. And tara, well... Hey. Wanna ask you something. If you tell me which is your favorite name. Ellodie. Ooh, I like that one too! Okay, if you're the keeper Of all the alters, Are there any others? Any I don't know about? Ooh! Ha! What? Oh, I think I just felt a little kick. She's getting so strong. Alice, what are you not telling me? Nothing, my prince. Hmm? I need you to do something for me. Because I give you everything you want, Don't I? Hmm? Don't I? What do you want? I want you to meet tara's doctor. For me. [Knocking] Come. I'd have mailed you your check. I didn't come for my check, gene. I came because... I was thinking about how everything went down. and, um... I just... I ju--I just wanted to say That I'm sorry for saying the things that I did About your generation. it was very mean of me. And I didn't mean to make you feel old. It did make me feel very judged by you. Yeah. And I realized that... We're in different places in our life. you know? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. but that doesn't mean That we have to hate each other. I could never hate you. And I could never hate you. Because I know that you have a big heart. Thank you. For seeing it. I did. Can I have my job back, gene? Hmm? Gene, can I have my job back? Please can I come back? So I've narrowed it down to my top three. Ellodie, trixie, and fiona. (ocean) they all sound good. You seem very excited. Oh, I've been waiting my whole life for this.
