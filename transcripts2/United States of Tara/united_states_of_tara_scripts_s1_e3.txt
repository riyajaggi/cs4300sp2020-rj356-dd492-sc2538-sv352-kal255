 United States of Tara (2009â€“2011): Season 1, Episode 3 - Work - full transcript 
 Tara returns after her recent bout of being Alice but as usual, remembers nothing of what happened. She has a session with her psychiatrist, Dr. Ocean, and expresses her fears that husband, Max, may be more interested in the 'alters' that in her. Meanwhile, Marshall tries out for a role in the school production of Grease. He strikes a friendship with a fellow student, named Jason, on the stage crew and is invited to his school church club. It's not quite what Marshall expected. Also, Tara's sister, Charmaine, refers a friend, named Tiffany, who wants some interior design work done. But Tara is none too pleased when it becomes obvious that Charmaine told Tiffany about Tara's multi-personality disorder. Desperate to get out of the house (and away from Tara's alters), Kate takes a part-time job as a waitress at a family restaurant.

CAN'T TARA DO SOME OF IT?
