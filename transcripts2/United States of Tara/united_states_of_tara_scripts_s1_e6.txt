 United States of Tara (2009â€“2011): Season 1, Episode 6 - Transition - full transcript 
 Tara's parents, Frank and Beverly, come for a visit ostensibly to celebrate Charmaine's 34th birthday. What they really want is for Max and Tara to let the kids live with them so they can have a "normal" life. Max is doing his best to help Tara get through the next couple of days without one of her alters emerging. As their visit goes on, all of the issues of a dysfunctional family come through: Tara's judgmental mom; Tara's father who loves his kids but will always side with his wife; and Charamine who feels neglected by her parents. Neither Max nor Tara will even contemplate letting the kids go live with their grandparents. Tara has her own unique way of sending her parents a message. Meanwhile, Kate ducks out of the family party to spend some intimate time with Gene at his apartment.
