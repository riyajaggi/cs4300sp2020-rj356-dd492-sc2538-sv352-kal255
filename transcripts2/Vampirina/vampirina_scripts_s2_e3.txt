 "The Woodsie Way." OK, I have a hat, flashlight, and my new hiking boots. Can't forget your sleeping bag. Or your pillow. Now I just need... my Woodsie map! I think I'm ready for my first Woodchuck Woodsie camping trip! And your trusty chaperone is ready, too! I'm quite the outdoors‐ghost, if I do say so myself. Wait. A ghost as a chaperone?

 Well, more like your secret and very handsome chaperone that nobody'll see. E‐Except you and Vee, of course. Which is a shame, because I am really loving this bandana. Whoo‐hoo! Demi used to come along on all my trips back in Transylvania. And we're gonna have the most terror‐ific time. I've got your camping cauldron packed, plenty of spell books, an enchanted night light. Ooh! Can't forget the bat‐hat and wing warmers! It gets pretty chilly hanging from a tree at night. Demi, I'm not gonna sleep as a bat. I've got a sleeping bag and a tent. But that's not how vampires go camping!

 But it's how Woodchuck Woodsies do it. I'm gonna do this camping trip the Woodsie Way. I really want to earn a badge without using any of my vampire powers. Wow! That's awesome, Vee. So, you're not gonna turn into a bat at all? Nope! Whoops. Just... getting it out of my system! But Vee, you're a vampire! And trust me, you're not gonna want to leave home without a magic map! Don't worry. That's what my Woodchuck Woodsie gear is for. I have everything I need! - ‐ Ew! - ‐ ‐Come on! ‐ OK, I think we're ready to raise our tent! One, two, three! Well, look at you, Vampirina. What an excellent tent! This calls for a Woodsie "Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!" Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! You're doing amazing, Vee. Getting a Woodsie "Whoo Whoo" right off the bat is a big deal! Did somebody say "bat"?! Oh! Sorry! Thought that was my cue. Demi, what's all this? Oh, I know I was supposed to leave all the magic stuff at home, but what's camping without a little, you know, pizazz? Creepy cocoa, anyone? Warms you to the bone! Thanks, but Woodchuck Woodsies don't use magical cauldrons. Oh, Woodsies! It's time for our hike! Gotta go! Now, remember, everyone has a chance to earn a hiking badge today. But first, we need a Woodsie to lead our hike. I'm ready, Ms. Peepleson! I've already picked a trail. It'll take us right to Silver Spring Falls! Oh, a waterfall! Excellent! Then, let's be on our Woodsie way. Do I hear a "Whoo" comin' on? Woodchuck Woodsies, Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Our first landmark! That's a pretty spooktacular tree. Well, it is kinda dead. And easy to remember! We'll look for it on our way back so we can know which way to go! Excellent hiking skill, Vampirina. Thanks! I think now's a good time for a water break. The great outdoors! Enjoying the hike, Demi? Loving it! I‐It's like I am one with nature. Aah! Oh, dear. Looks like this trail is blocked. Maybe it's time to head back. Uh, but we haven't made it to the waterfall yet. I'm sure there's something we can do. Psst! Vee! Need any help getting over this pesky log? 'Cause I brought spells! How about the floating charm, huh? You and the Woodsies can soar right over and be on your way? Demi, I can't do a floating charm in front of the Woodsies. But maybe there is a way over this log! Using my Woodsie skills! Feels strong as a skeleton! Everybody ready to get some air? Unh! Works like a charm! Ohh! Except it's not a charm at all. Good thinking, Vee. Oh, my! Whoo! Whoo! Vampirina, aren't you just full of surprises? Thanks! 'Cause I've got another one! Monster‐licious Trail Mix! ‐Yum! ‐I'm so hungry! You're totally gonna earn a badge! Mmm! They should make a Monster‐licious Trail Mix badge, 'cause you'd get that, too! Thanks! I'd say doing things the Woodsie way is going pretty well! OK, so you didn't need the spell book, but I need a snack! Who knew hiking would be so tiring? You're not even hiking! You're floating! Hey, it's harder than it looks, folks. ‐ ‐ Hmm... Which way should we go? It looks like maybe, uh... this way! Wait! No, uh... this way. ‐OK. ‐Great! Are you sure you don't want to check the magic map to see if you're going the right way? Mm‐mmm. If I use magic, I wouldn't be using my Woodsie skills. Plus, I already have a map. Oh, you mean the kind that no one can fold back up? Come on! I can do this. But this map is pretty fancy! Oh! It'll even reroute you if you run into a zombie swamp. Zombies, uh, wait. Hold on. It‐‐ it's still on Transylvania settings. Oh, they're on in‐‐ There! Are you sure? ‐Sure as a shriek! ‐ OK. Disappearing now. OK. The waterfall's gotta be this way. Well, isn't this delightful? What an adorable bridge! Awesome! Can we cross it, Mom? ‐Um... ‐Why don't I cross first and make sure everything is A‐OK? So far, so good! Just lovely‐‐ Ooh! Ooh! Stay put, Woodsies! And I guess I will, too. Oh, dear. What should we do? Maybe we can make stepping stones! ‐Help me with this rock! ‐ Oh, no. Now what? Don't worry, my little Woodsies. Uh, remember, it's always important to remain calm in an emergency. ‐ ‐Aah! Frog! Help! I mean, we will work this out - ‐the Woodsie way! - ‐ Aah! Save me! Ohh, this is all my fault. I definitely led everyone the wrong way. Now your mom's stuck! We don't have a raft or a rope, or a boat‐‐ But we do have a vampire. I think it's time to use some magic, Vee. But there's gotta be a way. We're Woodchuck Woodsies! And Woodchuck Woodsies use all of their skills in an emergency. Poppy's right. Woodsies do whatever they can to help their friends. OK. But I'm gonna need some help. - ‐Demi. - ‐ Don't worry. I'm taking all the magic stuff back to camp. Hold on! We have an emergency. Ms. Peepleson is stuck! I'm gonna need that spell book. But what about your badge?! That doesn't matter now. I gotta do this the Vee way. Whoo‐hoo! Vee is back! Ohh, dear! Uh‐oh! We have to hurry! Poppy, Bridget! Get all the rocks you can find. Demi, you're with me. Everybody ready? We know what to do. We need to distract Edna and the Woodsies. Aye, aye, Vee! ‐Boo! Boo! Boo! ‐ - ‐Bats! Ohh! - ‐ ‐Bat! It's a bat! ‐Aah! Is this rock big enough? Perfect. But we need a few more. Now, time for a spell. Ohh! Ohh! Ooh, bats! Aah! "Like a feather, fly together! Like a boat, stay afloat!" You did it! ‐Demi! ‐Time to skedaddle! Miss Peepleson! You can come back to shore now. Vampirina? You did this? With my friends' help. It's a Woodsie miracle! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ohh. My munchy‐kins. I thought I'd be on that bridge forever. And those bats! I think I've had enough excitement for one day. Let's head back to camp. ‐ ‐Preferably, as fast as we can. I got this, Demi. Look, the spooky tree! If we hike towards it, we'll get back to camp. Then Woodsies, march! Woodchuck Woodsies! Whoo Whoo Whoo! What an exciting hike! Now, time for badges! I would like to present Hiking badges to Bridget, Poppy, Renee, and Tiffany. That leaves Vampirina. It's OK, Ms. Peepleson. I'm sorry I led everyone the wrong way. I really didn't do this hike like a true Woodsie. You don't have to give me a badge. Well, we all make mistakes. How we fix them is what being a Woodsie is all about. So, I'm going to give you a different badge. Today, you showed composure and courage. You've earned the Emergency Badge! ‐All right, Vee! ‐Wow! ‐Great job, Vee! ‐Yeah, Vee! Woodsie Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! I always knew she was spooktacular. Now, who's ready for s'mores? Me! Me! Shh! And this'll definitely be a Woodsie camping trip to remember! Especially me! The most stylish ghost in the forest. Oh, and you, for, you know, - ‐earning your little badge and everything. - ‐ I guess I did need my vampire gear after all. We knew you could do it the Woodsie Way. As long as you did it the Vee way, too. Thanks. Hey, Demi. Do you still have that enchanted nightlight? You bet your bats, I do! Isn't that using magic? Since we're already using magic, what's a little more? ‐Wow! ‐Cool! "TNN." OK, what do you want to watch first for our movie night? Vampablanca, Dial "V" for Vampire, or Citizen Fang? Uh, why don't you pick? Heh. - ‐ Vampablanca, it is! - ‐ Vee, looks like you got an e‐mail. You mean an "eek"‐mail! Mama let me set up an account the other day. And it's from Frankie! ‐Frankie? ‐Who's that? She's my oldest friend from Transylvania! Frankie says she's gonna be visiting Pennsylvania soon, and wants to know if she can stay with us while she's here! We get to meet one of your friends from Transylvania! That'll be fun! Or... scary. Or both. Frankie is the best! We used to do everything together. Ghoul Guides, Spook‐away Camp, Scary‐skating. I haven't seen her since I moved. But now's our chance to catch up! Her mom's dropping her off tomorrow. Ooh, I can't wait to see our spooky little Frankie Bolt! I'm sure she's grown quite a bit since we moved. Ooh, she's probably lost her baby bolts by now! ‐ ‐Eee! That's her! Places, everyone! ‐ Frankie! ‐OMZ! It's Vee! - ‐In the freezing flesh! - ‐ You remembered our spookerific double‐secret clawshake! Of course, I did! Frankie, you remember Mama and Papa. ‐Hello, Frankie! ‐Ghoulishly great to see you again. ‐And Demi and Gregoria. ‐ How could I forget! You two are totally on poltergeist point! ‐ ‐That's a good thing, I guess? So, Frankie, what brings you to Pennsylvania? Well, I followed in my dad's footsteps and became a Junior Reporter! I'm doing a special report on life in Pennsylvania for TNN! The Transylvania News Network! ‐Wow! ‐Impressive! Wait a minute. Your dad's the one and only Franken Bolt, isn't he? Transylvania's number one newsman! Ohh, I'm his biggest fan! "For TNN, I'm Franken Bolt. Stay scary, Transylvania." What a sign‐off! ‐ ‐You know, I'm even working on one of my own. "For TNN, this is Demi Hauntley, ghosting out!" ‐ ‐I'm workin' on it. I can't wait to see you on Transylvania Television! We're simply spooked to have our very own Junior Reporter stay with us! We'll get the guest room all ready so you can film your news reports from in there! That would be frank‐tastic! Thanks! Wow, Vee! Your life in Pennsylvania looks terror‐ific! It took some getting used to, but now, it's pretty great, thanks to Poppy and Bridget! ‐ ‐That's them now! OMZ, I'm dying to meet them! - What are they? Mummies? - Trolls? Unicorns?! - ‐Well, uh... - ‐ Hi! They're... humans?! Well, yeah. This is Pennsylvania, after all. ‐What's wrong? ‐Oh, um... Nothing's wrong. Nothing at all. I'm Poppy. And this is Bridget. Vee told us all about you. Are you coming with us to school today? Yep! Mr. Gore said it would be OK for Frankie to join us in class, so she can get the full Pennsylvania experience! Mm. One spooky sec. I just need to bolt upstairs and film the first part of my news report. Staying on top of the story like a true news‐monster. Mmm. I'm kid reporter Frankie Bolt with a special report on life in Pennsylvania. Today, I'll be going undercover at a human school to confirm what most Transylvanians believe: Humans and monsters can't be friends. So, this is a human school, huh? No moat, no drawbridge, no trolls making you solve riddles before entering? Nope! No monsters at all! Oh! Which is why you might want to cover up your neck bolts and stitches. Right. Because humans get so jumpy and scared? Somethin' like that, yeah. I better put my ghost camera on invisible mode, then, too. Wow. There sure are a lot of humans in here. Morning, class. As you probably noticed, we have a friend of Vampirina's visiting us today. Vee, why don't you have your f‐‐ Spider! It's in your hair! Aah! Whoa! Uh! I'll help you, Mr. Gore! Humans are easily spooked. One of the many reasons they can't be friends with monsters. I'm glad Edgar was able to get that spider. Even if we did accidentally knock off Mr. Gore's glasses. Class normally isn't that exciting. Except for my butterfly mask! - ‐Mmm. - ‐ Mwah ha ha! What's that? I'm Edgar, the werewolf! ‐ ‐Roar! My art project is scary‐original, as usual. Mmm. Wow! Humans are even scared of a sweet, little werewolf mask?! Ooh! Papa packed chocolate eyeballs today. Who wants some? Now, that's what I call a monster‐licious lunch! Yeah! After getting to know Vee, I gotta say, I love those, too. ‐ ‐ Hey, Vee. I want to go see Night of the Cursed Mummy on Friday. Who's in? It's about an evil mummy who haunts a bunch of archeologists when they get trapped in a pyramid! - ‐Mwah ha ha ha ha! - ‐ Edgar, this is no way Mom is gonna let you see something so scary. A mummy? Scary?! Anyway, I'm out! Breaking story! Humans even make sweet ol' mummies the bad guys in their scary movies! Explains why they're so jumpy and screamy and so afraid of us. I can feel it in my stitches. Humans really don't get along with monsters at all! Frankie, how'd you like hanging out with humans today? Oh, um, no surprises. It's definitely gonna make a scary good story for my first piece as a Junior Reporter. That's so spooktacular! I can't wait to see your broadcast tonight. Ooh, our own little Frankie on the news! I'm so happy! It's‐‐ it's like I'm floating! Demi, you are floating! Oh! Right! Forgot I can do that sort of thing. Are you excited, Gregoria? Of course. You can't tell? Hold onto your bats! It's starting! Ghoul evening, and welcome to the Transylvania News Network's Evening News! I'm Franken Bolt. Tonight, we have a special report. Can they be friends with monsters? ‐Huh? ‐That's... weird. For this, we go to Frankie Bolt, reporting from Pennsylvania. Thanks, Dad. I spent the day at a human school just to see how easily spooked humans are. Can humans and monsters be friends? Let's see. ‐The werewolf! Roar! ‐ ‐Mwah ha ha ha! ‐Aah! And that confirms it. Humans and monsters can't be friends. Monsters can't be friends with humans? That's not true at all. Why would Frankie say a thing like that? Yeah. She was with us all day. Oh, you girls are two of my favorite living things ever. Thanks, Demi. But since we're living things, we need to breathe. Ohh! Heh. Sorry. I don't know what happened, but we better stop Frankie's report before she says anything worse. This is Frankie Bolt, signing off. ‐Goodnight! ‐Oh, no! We're too late. Hey, Vee. Did you see my report? We came up here to stop your report. Frankie, why did you say all that stuff about humans? Because it's the truth. All day, I saw humans being spooked by monster stuff. There's no way they can be friends with monsters. That's what everyone says back home. But that doesn't mean it's true. Humans can get scared sometimes. Especially humans like me. But being scared never kept us from being friends with Demi. ‐Or Gregoria. ‐Or me. Frankie, maybe you were so set on filming stuff at school that matched what you heard back home, you totally missed a monster/human friendship that was right in front of you the whole time. Like, huh, how Poppy and Bridget stopped by so we could all walk to school together. Or how Vee shared her chocolate eyeballs with us at lunch. And how Edgar invited us all to see a movie together. OMZ! Let me check my sources. ♪ But with Vee we made the right decision ♪ Wow. And even though you were scared of Vee at first, you still wanted to be her friend? Yeah. We knew even though she's a monster, she's still Vee. It took some getting used to, you know, seeing one of your best friends is a vampire. But now, I'm not scared at all. And now, we do everything together. Just like you and I used to do. OMZ! I'm so, so sorry. You took a chance being friends with a monster, so I should take a chance on being friends with a human. That is, if you still want to be friends. ‐Happy to have ya. ‐The more monsters, the merrier! ‐Never thought I'd say that. ‐ I hope you can come back soon, Frankie. Maybe you can meet even more humans! You bet my bolts, I will! ‐ ‐Awesome! I hope Frankie was able to convince TNN to stop reporting false stuff about humans. There's only one way to find out. Eerie evening, ghosts and ghouls. Our top story tonight is all about the Zombie Olympics. But first, we have a follow‐up report by Frankie Bolt. Frankie? My follow‐up report is an apology. Yesterday, I said some things about humans that were totally not true. Humans might be a little jumpy, but it doesn't mean that they can't be friends with monsters. I got the chance to meet two special humans who are now my friends. ‐Ahh! That's us! ‐On TNN! Wow! I think everyone in Transylvania should try meeting a human one day. You'll see how awesome they can be! This is Frankie Bolt, signing off. There ya have it, folks. Humans and monsters can be friends. ‐All right! ‐Yay! She did it! Atta girl, Frankie! She's my favorite new spook‐caster! That was some stone‐cold reporting! I knew Frankie would come through! Hopefully, Frankie's report will change everyone's mind. And maybe more monsters will give humans a chance. ‐Like you did. ‐Which is good. Because being friends with humans is the best. And that's the truth!
