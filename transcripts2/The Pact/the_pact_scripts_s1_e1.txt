 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire. (Rev 20:15) Their lawyers will crush us. You say this now? Before the last article in the series? We have to be cautious. Piotr has evidence. Not evidence but his personal issues. He's doing his job. I can't run it without consulting our lawyers. - And? - He'll meet the lawyers and decide. Fuck.

 It's the last article in the series. Just a few more days. I need this information. Try to understand it. I do. And I'm going home. You won't find anything there. Only tried to check my email. Did you sleep well? As usual. I'm gonna go then. About your article on Hydro... Be careful. Your honeymoon has ended. So you’re holding me to my promises. These decisions will be crucial for Poland's energy security. Will the government address the issue of the Hydro foundation? As the Minister of Economy, you must be interested in alleged embezzlement. The investigation still continues. So I can't really say. But the Kurier reporters found out... FINANCIAL DIRECTOR TOP SUSPECT HYDRO-PUZZLE Grodecki is a thief. We have evidence. The allegations are serious and risky. They'll sue us to clear their reputation. - And they will win. - So we rewrite the CBI statement? You want to tell the truth or be the first? Come on. Look out! Who's going to the Hydro conference? A trainee. They won't say anything. We're holding for release. But Piotr got right info on the foundation's money flow. The protocol says: true info from various sources. - They did break you. - We're not a tabloid, we're respected. Who earned you this respect? - We wrote many articles about it. - And we will write more. - Why the fuck? - Let the CBI do their job. If they confirm our intel, we'll be sitting pretty. Looks like you do as you're told. First find hard evidence, then play a smart ass. We've been working on this for months. Poking around this shit is no fun for me. If he's innocent, his lawyers will crush the entire paper. My source's gonna fucking pull out. Hard evidence won't pull out! I don't recognize you. Maybe it is a safer way out. There's one thing we can do. Your source. If she reveals her ID, the allegations will come from her. - We might... - ...sell the informer. It's the only thing we've got. People don't come to us so that we hide behind them. - Catchy. - You fucking said it. Revealing your source will make things easier. I sign your stories with my name so I risk the most. You gain the most. You should protect what you care for. - Meaning? - Your name. Go fuck yourself. I will. The Hydro scandal continues. We're waiting for a press conference. The company will comment on the Kurier articles that attack its Financial Director Daniel Grodecki. Grodecki says he waits for the results of the CBI investigation. Now we're going over to the conference. Good afternoon. The Hydro management board have looked into the case of Hydro's Financial Director accused of alleged embezzlement. The CBI report will soon confirm our findings. The allegations are groundless. Where did the fuckers get the CBI report? Regretfully, Director Grodecki decided to seek career opportunities outside our company. Why does he quit if he's innocent? ...opens a discussion about the ethics of media. Let's go! This is Weronika Zawadzka. Someone's following me. A tall man. In a dark hoodie. Hold on. A false alarm. Sorry. - Time off. - In a sec. MORE INFO OR OUR DEAL IS OFF. Lovely beef from green Irish pastures. We run out of ours? - YOU HAVE ONE HOUR. - It's Europe: the exchange of meat. - Can't everyone eat their own? - Europe would be useless then. - How are you? - The story's up in the air. Don't give a damn about the frigging Hydro-puzzle. How are you doing? He has to pay for that. - You're gonna regret it. - You don't get it. That's why you only do articles on local libraries. And you're gonna get fucking killed. I think it's yours. It is. Thank you. All of them should apologise. No apologies around here. No such tradition. Hania... Thank you. DON'T SCREW IT UP. - Fuck, yes. - What's up? Gotta go. In my office. How did the Hydro report leak out? My report? Leak, meaning what? Its spokesman has just referred to our findings. Did you talk to them? - Are you suspecting me? - Just trying to find out what happened. Does your report incriminate Grodecki? As a director managing the budget, he made a few inflated transactions. - So we have nothing. - I'll keep searching. - No. - Yes. I want to finish it. That's why I'm worried. Your call for help. - Three false alarms in two weeks. - I know. I'm sorry. There are things... ...over which even I have no control. - I can't save you from your demons. - Can I go now? What about a soft version? Questions instead of theses. People don't want to read questions. But we know nothing. Hydro refers to the CBI report. So Piotr is better than the CBI? A catchy phrase for my business card. - What's this? - Hard evidence you wanted. Eight million? And they didn't find it? - They didn't know where to look. - We waited for the CBI report. It's their fault they missed this and they didn't catch Grodecki red-handed. If anyone asks, as usual, the article was written by Monika. Off we go! What now? - You're going to see Kowalik. - Are you sure? It's going to be fine. Enjoy your meal! - We should talk. - Let's eat first. All right. What is it? It means you stole it. NEW EVIDENCE AGAINST GRODECKI - You believe it? - Did you steal it or not? I'm not a thief if that's what you mean. Cool! You've really calmed me down. Gonna ride my bike. Kuba! I work for both of you. For your security. Nothing else matters. But security has its price. And one pays it if they have to. No mercy. I don't have a clue what you mean. You don't. You don't. I'm sorry. What's going to happen now? Nothing. Nothing will change. You will go to jail. No. Jail isn't for people like me, love. - You leaving? - Yes. Will you read it? Look, I sign your articles but I don't like it at all. It's your story now. Enjoy the fact. I respect you for taking the story to the very end. It can't have been easy. Turn off the lights, would you? What do you want? I don't think it's a good idea. As you wish. I know where it is. Hi. Hi. Come in. You want a drink? - No, thanks. Is Ewa around? - In the garden. You wanted to see me so here I am. Piotrek... - I wanted to talk. - I won't change a word - in the article. - I get it. - So you know what will happen. - I know more than you do. - Don't drag me into this. - Wait! What is it? - Kuba. - What about him? Take care of him. Are you going anywhere? People like you are usually given suspended sentences. Or you'll be released after a year. - Piotrek! - He's never even met me. You're my brother. I didn't know you worked for that foundation. When I saw the documents, it was too late. It's fine. - You don't even sign the articles. - I would if we weren't family. Look, I bear no grudges. I got myself into this shit. Is it Father's? Yeah. Did he say anything? You don't want to know. Keep it. I'm trying to quit. You always wanted to have it. Thanks. - Talk to Ewa. - What about? She's in the garden. Hi. How does it feel to send your own brother to jail? He did it himself. - He's an honest man. - Not according to our investigation. Prick. It's not personal. You're screwed up. I always thought so. - Not always. - Always. Daniel? Go away. Get out! You can't do this! On the contrary. Where is Piotr Grodecki? You might respect the fact his brother died yesterday. We have guests. You have no right to touch my computer. - We do. - On what grounds? Proceedings to take evidence you seem to hide. Where's the external drive? In my arse. Shall I ask them to look into it? Please search Mr Grodecki's bag. - Do fucking something! - Can I talk to him? - Only if you talk sense into him. - Come on. - All my work is here! - Who's your source? - Nice try. - Tell me before they get it. - I don't know. - What the fuck? It's Sara. She didn't want to meet so we used chat rooms and email. - You said you knew her. - But not her identity! It all adds up. All documents lead to the Hydro Foundation. - The drive has no ID on the source? - No. Someone framed you. - Let them enjoy it. - Why? Because it doesn't matter now. We'll minimise damages at least. Here you are. Happy reading. Excuse me. - To see Colonel Grodecki. - Your pass? Thanks. I always started with Nepomucen's feet. Now I've started with his head. And he looks different. It's time to go, Dad. For fuck's sake, it's the funeral of your son! A thief and a suicide. Let it go. No. It hurts to see a man pass away. It hurts more when it is someone whom I've known since he was a boy, a son of my dear friend. Someone for whom I held ceremonies of baptism, First Communion, and confirmation. Now it is my painful duty to place his ashes in the ground and commend his soul to God. You hurried, Daniel, to the next world... Apparently, you had your reasons, which we are not entitled to judge... Our good Lord shall do it for us. For He is the ultimate judge of our matters and our only hope in this world. Congratulations. Mr Grodecki! My name's Tomasz Nawrot. - I knew your brother very well. - I know who you are. Please accept my condolences. Thank you. I have a lot of respect for your work. We need to talk. - It's not a good time. - It's about your source, Sara. I know her identity. - How? - I checked it to make sure. It was Daniel. You were in touch with your own brother. - What are you... - The chat room, emails, it was him. - Stop it! - I have evidence. OK. I got it. Thanks. Leave me fucking alone. TEN MONTHS LATER HOLY MONDAY - I knew it. Chilling out? - Lunchtime. You handled the Road Authorities? It's not a bakery, boss. It will be done by tomorrow. One burger, please. ADRIAN BOGUSZ'S SHADY LOANS - Never wanted to get promoted. - You did what you could. The guy grants fake loans for huge money. Monika from your ex-team collects scandals like merit badges. So here's to her. - Water? - No, thanks. You're not taking my calls. It's hard to get in touch with you. - What do you want? - Spend Easter with me. - Easter? - Yes. To celebrate Sunday Easter breakfast. What's there to celebrate? Do come. At least his hobby is cool. Adrian Bogusz says he's going to file a lawsuit against the newspaper. - A word on Kurier's accusations? - Ridiculous. Like last year, when they attacked Hydro's director. So your bank didn't grant inflated mortgage loans? - You can't make money this way. - But you can launder it. You from Kurier too? Did he tell you anything we could print? He said we should talk to his lawyer. - So what do we have? - Nice pics. That's not much. Will be back in a minute. Can we talk? - How's Rafał? Uptight? - Like every boss. Get back to our team. It will do you good. I could use your help now. That guy, Adrian Bogusz... A complicated case. I don't know what to do or whom to put on this story. They were sent to Kurier this morning. - Skalski? - Uh-huh. The Minister of Economy... - And she is...? - Here the fun begins. Adrian Bogusz's wife. I don't care. Excuse me. Yes? Yes, we've met. Today? Now? And the address? Good afternoon. Take a seat, please. Mr Grodecki? I'm Marek Szulc. Can I have your ID, please? - What's this all about? - No idea. Formalities completed, let me proceed. According to the will of Mr Daniel Grodecki, today at 2 pm, Ms Ewa Grodecka, the widow, and Mr Piotr Grodecki, the brother of the deceased, are to receive this package. This is all from me. Thank you. - What is this? - I have no idea. Is this a joke? March 30th. 4.30 pm. In two hours. There's also this. Let me check the coordinates. The middle of nowhere near Łuków. ACCESS DENIED. AUTHORISED USERS ONLY. It's blocked. It won't open. It's important we get there on time. We're on time. What's going on here? Piotr! Fuck. It's Bogusz. - I'll call an ambulance! - He's trapped. Help me get him out! Leave him! The car's going to explode! What Abraham? Let's go! Get in. Let's go.
