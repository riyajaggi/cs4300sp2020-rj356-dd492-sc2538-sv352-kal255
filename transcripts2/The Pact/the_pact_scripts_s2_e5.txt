 I was waiting. Nothing happened. - Until Justyna died. - Did you go back to him? I did. He said it was a coincidence. The investigation showed nothing. I felt he was lying. That's why I showed you the Natalia video. Eryk asked me what Andrzej was doing in Silesia. Why? What's to be found there? If they ask questions, it means they lost control. - Pull over, please. - What's up? Just pull over here. It's gonna be better this way. In an hour, every patrol will be looking for me. We need to check what Andrzej discovered in Silesia. Be careful. Eryk knows you'll go there.

 Don't trust anyone. This is Piotr Grodecki. Please leave a message. Someone's waiting for you in the conference room. Are you here to see me? Roman Hanus. We met in Silesia. How can I help you? Congratulations on your duel against Kostrzewa. Basically, we all want the same thing. Do we? Glad I could be of help. I don't think I understand. Oh... So Darek didn't mention me. In the last few days, it was necessary to act quickly. This is exactly what I can do. What matters is that the party is in good hands. Good night. And see you soon. He wanted to help. The money for Janiak, was it him? Was it? What else? You believe we built this party on your smile? You wanna be the leader, don't pretend you're above such things. We need people like Hanus, get it? Especially in your region, Silesia. One day, we'll have to clean this bloody mess of strikes. I'll do it myself. - I'm going there tomorrow. - You joking? - I'll end this strike. - Please, don't do it now. After the election. I promise. No. Previously saved route. Go west. Distance to destination: 16 km. ST. CHRISTOPHER'S HOSPICE Hello. I'm looking for one of your patients. A friend of mine paid him a visit two days ago. MEDICAL CHART EMERGENCY CONTACT: HUBERT ADAMSKI THE POLISH INSTITUTE OF MINING GEOLOGY EMPLOYEES According to the theory of plate tectonics, the Earth's lithosphere is broken up into seven large and many minor tectonic plates. Their relative movement ranges from a few to a dozen centimeters annually. Plate movement is driven by... Goodbye. Hello. I'm Piotr Grodecki. Andrzej Bitner was my friend. I've heard what happened. I'm sorry. Is this from your Institute? Your father must have given it to Andrzej. It is. I think it is. I have to know what it means. Sure. Leave it with me. I'll let you know when I find anything. You don't get it. Andrzej's dead because of this. Pardon? You have to help me with my reporter's investigation. Their break ends in ten minutes. We have to be gone by then, OK? GEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE ARCHIVE: SEARCH - And? - Documents on Brygida. - What documents? - Don't know. Let's find out. They're gone. I don't know why. - Who had access to them? - Only the Archive employees. - Can they just take them out? - No. The files are for viewing only. Wait here. I'll be right back. GEOLOGICAL AND MINING REPORT ON THE CAUSES OF THE BRYGIDA BLAST USER ACCESS TO THE DOCUMENTS Thank you. - The team will prepare the rally. - What about the mine? The general manager will fix a meeting with the strike chairman. Officially, no one knows about it. FRIDAY: 2 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION ON STRIKE What's going on? Down with Revival! Fuck... Go! - Go! - I can't! Maybe we should wait? Told you: you'd end up in a wheelchair if you postponed the operation. So? Was it worth it? Why do you want to sell it? I can't live there any longer. Darek, I have to move on. I might go away. I should do the same. - I'd finally take some rest. - You don't want to. You never did. You will manage. Otherwise, what's the point of all this? Hi. I'm making this video because I can't be with you now. I'm ill. Last year, I had an accident, in which my spine was injured. When the election campaign began, I gave up my rehabilitation therapy. Now I have to undergo an operation. I never talked about my health. I considered it a sign of weakness. And in politics, weakness is never disclosed. But I don't want to pretend. Yesterday, I lied to you. I lied and... ...I'm ashamed of myself. Terribly ashamed. Yes, I paid for the information we planned to use in our campaign. I let down you and myself. I paid the money to... ...to show the truth. I could no longer watch PM Kostrzewa ruin this country. If I had to, I would do it again. Yes, I would. I DID BUY THE INFO TO SUPPORT OUR CAMPAIGN. NO REGRETS. Can you tell me the reason for my detention, please? I want to see the proper document. Or talk to the prosecutor. Open it. Martyna Krupicz. A former ISA agent. Currently accused of terrorist activity. She was your informer. Where did you last see her? The reporter's privilege. You need a lecture on the Press Law? Pursuant to Article No. 240 of the Penal Code, you are obliged to give us all the necessary information. OK. But not here. I'll do it at the Prosecutor's Office. That's not all. Your fingerprints were found on the crime scene. Where is she? I don't know. We have it confirmed that she's planning an assassination attempt on the Revival leader, Anna Wagner. You have to help us prevent another tragedy. Where is she? Help! What's going on? I let down you and myself. THIS VIDEO MAY CHANGE THE ELECTION RESULTS. REVIVAL CAN OWN UP TO THEIR MISTAKES. I paid the money to show the truth. SKALSKI'S CONFESSION: 'I'D DO IT AGAIN' '...readers support...' '...his video gets positive reviews...' The Brygida miners are continuing their hunger strike. However, Mayor of Bytom, Anna Wagner was not warmly welcomed. The protesters attacked her before she got into the mine premises. WAGNER ATTACKED IN SILESIA PROTESTS AGAINST REVIVAL WILL REVIVAL LOSE SILESIA? SILESIA DOESN'T WANT WAGNER SILESIA DOESN'T WANT WAGNER I talked to Wysocki. They weren't locals. - What do you mean? - A classic set-up. They showed up one hour before us to support the protesters. Kostrzewa? He probably wanted to make up for the debate. Can we prove it? Now you must end this strike. YOUR SECURITY - OUR RISK HUNGER STRIKE Good afternoon. I'm happy we can finally meet. My father worked here. Did you know that? I do realise how important this place is for you. And I want to fight for it too. Any specifics? Brygida is on the top of a pit-closure list. If nothing changes, in a few months, you'll be out of work. Nobody will. Not even union leaders. But I can still help you. If the Revival Party wins the election, I'll give you an immunity guarantee for at least next five years. We will sign an agreement. Today. With the media present. There's only one condition. The strike has to end. Everything looks nice, but the decision is not mine. If you want, I can say it to the chairmen of all the trade unions. - That's not the point. - You need more time? Mr Roman Hanus. He's the one you should talk to. We're going to the Prosecutor's Office. Don't pull up. Don't... Go, fucking go! Go, go! - Your team is in Silesia. And you? - You know what happened. - So you're not coming? - No, I have to stay here. - You can't leave it to Wagner. - Don't worry. She'll manage. You forgotten who the leader is? - She'll screw it all up! - So what am I to do about it? Don't just sit there. Come to Silesia. - Like, now? - When else? All right. Meet you there. - Is everything OK? - Yes. The ambulance will wait for us at 7 a.m. No eating or drinking. Thank you. Very good. Here, vibrato. Your turn. And from the top. Absolute pitch. Unfortunately, it's her mother she takes after. I talked to the strike chairman. What did you promise him? Nothing. They won't end the strike without your permission. You must have misunderstood them. Brygida is state-owned. Are you trying to disgrace Kostrzewa? Are you? I have the right to know what you and Darek agreed on. If one of the first decisions taken by the new government was a green light to the privatisation of Brygida, we might save it together. We both know it's unprofitable. You know the attitude of trade unions to privatisation. - It's better than a closure. - I can't believe it. You did set up the strike. What they need is private money. Perhaps. If so, we'll invite tenders. I understand and respect it. But today's poll results... Think about it. Anna Wagner ends the strike, saves jobs, and crushes Kostrzewa. You'll get all the credit for the end of the campaign. Please think it over. This is my last offer. We sign an agreement and you end the strike today - to show your support for Revival. - What about the investor? - He's in it. You can check it. - What investor? We agreed that the only chance to save the mine was to privatise it. You're joking, are you? Who is it? For now, he prefers to stay anonymous. Hanus? Did he set you up? Mr Wysocki! How did you know it was Hanus? - What does it matter now anyway? - It does to me. He's been hanging around the mine for a few years. Why? We have something he needs. Resources. Rare earth elements. In the arms industry, access to deposits is an invaluable asset. - Are they here? In Brygida? - No. But our company has a license to mine them. It's the only thing he's after. He'll fucking sack the people anyway. Are you sure you're ready for this? Hi. You seen it? The iKurier writes good things too. Comments are mostly positive, really. How am I feeling? Great, actually. I'm on my way to meet you. UNKNOWN: GO TO MY DESK. PIOTR Yes? Are you alone? I've been trying to reach you all day long. Pretend it's not me. They might be watching you. - Uh-huh. Who? - The ISA people. They killed Andrzej. - Now they tried to kill me. - What? I saw them kill two policemen to take me over. Make it public. Or they're gonna pin it on me. - I need to talk to Seidler. - No! He ratted me to the ISA. - You're being paranoid! - Trust me! Do it so that I go on with this case. IN SILESIA, THE ISA DETAINED A WEEKLY REPORTER... ...PIOTR GRODECKI. NO CAUSE PROVIDED. REVENGE FOR THE ARTICLE? SHAME ON OUR COUNTRY! ISA DETAINED A WEEKLY REPORTER. WHO'S AFRAID OF GRODECKI? ISA SAYS NOTHING. WHY? THEY'RE FU&@ING NUTS! STILL NO WORD FROM ISA. HUSHING UP INFO? Who did you tell about me? Spit it out! Nobody. I've no idea what you mean. They killed two people because of you to cover up their tracks. You think they'll treat you differently? - I was only supposed to help him. - Whom? - Hanus! - You idiot... OK, I have an idea. You'll be my informer. - No... - What? - You can't help me anyway. - Everything will be revealed. You'll end up in jail and you're done. You prefer that? You fucking prefer that? - What do you want? - Evidence. After each accident, you make a site inspection. You go underground to collect samples and any evidence that will help you determine the causes of the accident. The results are later stored in one place. I was the leader of one of the teams. It was going to be a formality. That day, blasting works were carried out in the mine. Here. Everyone assumed it was the direct cause of the explosion. But the analyses of coal dust showed the blast had come from here. From the equipment that must have caused a spark. But what has Hanus got to do with that? One of his companies was responsible for maintaining this equipment. He would have been found guilty. Once we started the inspection, they called me. They couldn't afford such a scandal. - Who knows about these documents? - Hanus and me. And you. - Anyone at the mine? - No one. Detained by the ISA? What's this about? I have the right to know. Can it stay between him and me for now? It's not about you and him, but about The Weekly. What's going on with him? What did he tell you? - He is my reporter. - In my newspaper. If you have a problem with that... ...you have to fire me. SZYMON BIELIK, AGED 30, TRAGICALLY TAKEN FROM US The ISA. Eryk Nosol and his men forged the analyses to cover it up. Hanus paid a bribe to hide his company's mistake. - Hanus? - Yes. - Fuck! - What is it? - He wants to buy the mine. - What for? He's been trying to do it for years. They have a license to mine the deposits indispensable for the arms industry. - For fuck's sake... - What? That was the point. He did it on purpose. He blew up the mine to take over the deposits. Then, he set me on the tender so that it would be announced again. Andrzej discovered it. - That's why he died. - You think Hanus caused the blast? - Thirty-six miners are dead. - There are too many coincidences. It's impossible. We need to publish it before the election silence. I must have Hanus's side of the story. Call him and say you want to see him. And I'll meet him instead. - No. - Don't worry. I'll be fine. Trust me. Please. Keep it safe for me. And so you're here. Have a little faith. What about Hanus? Taken care of. Good. Hello. I'm afraid I have some bad news. We found out about a potential attack. We'll secure the rally. You should go with us now. - I didn't expect to see you here. - Just a few questions on record? - Maybe another time. - I insist. Revival! Revival! - Go ahead. - What are your links to the blast...
