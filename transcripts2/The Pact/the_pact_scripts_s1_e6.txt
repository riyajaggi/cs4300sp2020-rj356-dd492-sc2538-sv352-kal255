 You should fear the sword yourselves; for wrath will bring punishment by the sword, and then you will know that there is judgment. (Job 19:29) Go! Go! I'm sorry to bother you but the circumstances are exceptional. What is it? The manager of your hotel is missing. - Pardon? - His flat was cleared out. Please report it to the police. I dismissed him after you left my hotel. Can you tell me anything about him?

 Like what? - How long did he work for you? - More than two years. Did you notice anything disturbing? No. He was recommended by a reliable source. - If you'll excuse me... - Recommended by whom? Tomek Nawrot. - We’ve got only 15 minutes. - We'll make it. I hope so. Mr Nawrot! Mr Editor? What a surprise. Have you been waiting here for me? I’d like to talk to you for a second. Here? Now? I have an important meeting. What you did for Skalski needed a lot of courage.

 Let’s not exaggerate. At the TV studio, what was really your point? You said the party would start. What party exactly? You know, I really need to go now. - But how about lunch tomorrow? - Lunch? I have an offer for you. During the procession attended by a few hundred people, a young woman was stabbed in the belly and died instantly. Who did we send there? - Agata. - Good. We have unofficial information about a man in a leather jacket. He was allegedly seen near the woman... Andrzej was right: someone conned us. The guy vanished. Someone's covering up their tracks. I won’t help you. Handle it on your own. - Can’t you see it's all linked? - What is? We'll check it out once more. Quietly, or we’ll fail again. ...a video from one of our viewers... You listening to me at all? ...a procession participant. - It's Piotrek! - Fuck! That's all we need. Bloody hell. - Impossible. - I knew he’d get us into some shit. - We'll cut off from him. - You don't think... Doesn’t matter what I think! 'A Kurier reporter kills' will pop up on the news ticker! All we can do is minimize the losses. We’ll say he broke down after his brother’s death. We tried to help him but he refused treatment. He got nervous and violent. And we dismissed him yesterday. - You want to use him? - No. You will. Pardon? We can’t afford two scandals in one day. You got us into the minister shit so you’ll help clean this one! Sorry. Yesterday, the management board asked me who should take Andrzej’s place. Guess who I recommended. You don’t want me to change my mind, do you? You do what you have to do to get what you want. Simple as that. Monika! What's wrong? Piotr? What are you talking about? I don’t believe it. I just don’t. Sir, there’s someone for you. We’re the police. We’d like to ask you a few questions. Have you found him? - It concerns my grandson, correct? - No. Your son. - What do you want from him? - Do you know where he is? Wait a minute... What is it about? It's about this. Please, take a look. Your son is suspected of committing a murder. What are you trying to frame him in? - We just want to help. - Help? Easy, easy! Let go of me. My name is Piotr Grodecki. Today, I witnessed the death of a CBI agent: Weronika Zawadzka. She was killed by the same people who are responsible for the deaths of Grzegorz Merta, Adrian Bogusz, and Daniel Grodecki. The same people abducted my nephew, Kuba Grodecki. They did it to protect the conspiracy they participate in. So far, they thought they were untouchable. I’m recording this statement to change it. When Weronika Zawadzka discovered the evidence of their crimes... She was murdered. HOLY SATURDAY I’d like to ask you a favour. I wanted you to be the one who'd hear my confession. Because it's going to be my last confession. What are you talking about? A sinner like me... doesn’t deserve to be forgiven. Please, calm down. You can confess your sins now. I didn’t love my son. I didn’t love Daniel. Paweł Walczak and his son Kamil were killed on July 20th 2013. The Pact members carried on with their business. So far, they thought they were untouchable. I’m recording this statement to change it. You must take it to the police. He has Kuba. Who? Nawrot. What makes you think it’s him? - He shot that film. - How do you know? Weronika found his reflection in the video. I’m supposed to meet him today. After he brought the audio to the TV station, Monika and I got back to our investigation. When’s the meeting? - Maybe I’ll go with you? - Don’t move. Give me two minutes. In Oslo, things are going as planned. The briefing is at 1 p.m. You meet the team at 3 p.m. If you’ll just sign here, minister. I’m no longer a minister. What's this? An annexe to confirm you're a negotiator on behalf of the government. We must send it to the PM Chancellery. - Is that all? - Almost. - Someone would like to meet you. - Who? She’s waiting by the side entrance. - See you soon. - Good luck! Hi, it’s me. We have to meet now. All right. Piotruś, what’s going on? - They’re framing me. - I can guess that much. Who is? The less you know, the better. OK, how can I help you? This is all I’ve got. If I don’t call you until midnight, upload it onto the Net. - Send it to all the media. - You're kidding me? Until then, I don’t think you should watch it. One more thing. I need your car. You fucking know what you’re doing? Are you sure? And I know someone who might help me. We’re sorry about this. It’s time to join forces. - We have her call records. - You were often in touch recently. It's personal. Shit! The girl’s dead. It’s time we started helping each other. You want to interrogate me? So stick to the protocol. I know it was you. No, there was no talk of killing anyone. Not Weronika. No, you listen to me. You’re going to pay for that. - What’s next? - I don't know. Maybe some holidays? Sure. You’ll go back straight to work. It’s been a long week. I’m glad you’re here with me. You've won. What are you doing here? - I was supposed to meet Andrzej. - So where is he now? How should I know? Your face pops up everywhere today. What’s going on? Are you hungry? Shall I order something for you? They have exquisite beef. It flies from Dijon once a week. Every Saturday at 9 a.m. On Holy Saturday, it tastes the best. You’re gonna tell me what’s going on? - Or should I make a guess? - My nephew’s been abducted. - Daniel's son? - Now Andrzej's vanished. - Does it mean anything to you? - Should it? You won’t get away with this. I have no idea what you’re talking about. You don't? You’re as blind as your colleagues from Kurier. - I'll fucking kill you. - You’re barking up the wrong tree. I’m not the one you’re looking for. Tell me what you know. Daniel, Adrian... Grzegorz, Paweł... They killed themselves or went missing. Too much of a coincidence not to link them. - You did business together. - A long time ago. A very long time ago. - I made my money and went my way. - And they let you go so easily? I knew their sins, they knew mine. Fair deal. They’re still in this together and you’re not, right? I don’t know. There must be some fuck-up. - He's killing them one by one. - Who? The guy had a compass that broke down. But I promised him he’d pay for everything. But you... I’m a bit scared of you right now. Who is it? He recruited us for the Konary centre. Show me this fucker! He’s not here. Because he took this photo. Who? Search. Yes? It's your colleague. Yes, Monika? What? I didn't know that anything happened to Skalski. - Hello, Monika? - Piotr? Are you with Nawrot? - What’s going on? - What’s wrong with Skalski? ...and hit the government car... Hold on. The limousine’s driver died on the spot. The passengers of the smashed car were ex-minister Dariusz Skalski and Iwona Bogusz, who accompanied him... They fucking killed him in broad daylight. Who gave you a tip-off on Skalski? The hotel manager but he’s a pawn. He’s vanished anyway. It’s the same with Skalski. They failed to disgrace him so they got rid of him. What’s the stake in their game? Was Skalski dismissed by the PM? Almost. He was to stay as a negotiator. The treaty. Our energy security. Skalski was trying to push through a regulation that didn’t suit them. What now? Now we’ll go for a drive. Come on. - Watch this guy. - Meaning what? What’s going on? You thought I wouldn’t find out. What are you talking about? It’s your fault she was killed. Are you mad? Did it take you long to make her paranoid? I was trying to protect her. But you dragged her into that again. Who did you call outside the morgue? - Sorry? - Give me your mobile. The other one, for fuck’s sake! It’s not what you think. If you make this call now, you’ll screw up everything. We’re conducting an inquiry against them. Weronika asked me... Stop lying! You fucking hear me?! I really didn’t know. I didn’t know they would do it. Who? These were supposed to be scams only. I just gave him information. For years. I didn’t know he was capable of that. Who?! Excuse me! Do you know where the post office is? - What’s wrong? Can I help you? - No, thank you. Where did you get it? We knew she was at the Central Station. - We saw her on the CCTV footage. - What about Andrzej? He used her key. We had to detain him. Call Andrzej. I’ll call a taxi. - Hello? - Hi, it's me. Is everything OK? Good. Listen, don’t tell them anything. Don’t tell them anything for now. Piotr, I’ll help you. - Spare your effort. - You won't get it done by yourself. Piotr, I know what steps to take. Please, let me finish this properly. For Weronika. I know who you are. Fine. Let’s do it. - Fancy a drink? - Where’s Kuba? No foreplay? He's safe. Let’s start over. Where’s Kuba? How should I know you didn’t make a copy? I did. More than one. If anything happens to my family, all will be revealed. And otherwise you’ll just shut up? Not your style, huh? Let the boy go. Come here. It’s only business, nothing more. If Daniel had seen things this way, nothing would have happened. - Like what? - Everything. Kids, fires, Abrahams. It was Daniel. I wouldn’t have come up with such an idea. - What's this bollocks? - It's true. When Nawrot got the fuck out, the group had to be disciplined. And then your brother came up with that whole Pact idea. Kids as a guarantee of loyalty. It was either you or your child. A work of genius. Daniel wouldn’t have done that. You keep implying we wanted to do that. Why can't you fucking get it? No one wants to burn their friend’s kid during a long weekend. But when the motivation is down, you need a new stimulus. And Daniel, with his religious frenzy, had a brilliant idea. The stake was to be horrific to avoid another Nawrot story. And yet something went fucking wrong. Sometimes you can’t just talk. Sometimes you need to make a show. Did Daniel know you were going to do that? He caught up as we went along. So he didn’t. He came up with that. But it’s one thing to have an idea and another to see it come to life. I respect him for staying with us until the end. It must have excited him. It must excite you too, huh? Your daddy messed with your heads... EASTER SUNDAY THE CENTRAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION HAS DETAINED FIVE WARSAW BUSINESSMEN. CHARGES HAVE ALREADY BEEN BROUGHT AGAINST ALL OF THEM. This success is the result of the CBI operation. The CBI conducted an inquiry against the group for a long time. The evidence is being collected, so this is all I can say at the moment. But I hope the details of our operation will be revealed soon. Then, you’ll learn all the facts. Do you know what links this case with yesterday’s murder of Mr Derenda? Please, do not anticipate the findings of the investigation. For now, there’s no reason to link this death to our investigation. This is all for today. Thank you very much. Goodbye, thank you.
