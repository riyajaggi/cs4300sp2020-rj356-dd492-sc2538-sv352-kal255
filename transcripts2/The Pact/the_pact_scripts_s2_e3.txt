 starring music by photography by written by directed by This is Anna Wagner. Please leave... Done. We can transfer the team to the hotel. And schedule a meeting in an hour. How the fuck did it happen? - We're looking into it. - You were supposed to protect us. Only few people knew about the documents. Only few. Including you.

 - Don't forget yourself. - For fuck's sake, people died! People died. Every detail matters to us. I don't remember anything else. I can't help you. You were going to make an announcement. About what? Ms Wagner, let me make it clear. How you're playing out your campaign is of no interest to me. But if someone wants to kill you, I must know who that is. How did Kostrzewa find out? - We don't know it was him. - It was him or an Arma-Com person. We need evidence. A link. Any possible connection. My hands are tied now. Sure. Please think about it. Who would have found the information inconvenient? Mr Grodecki! What are you doing here? - I was at the conference. - Were you really? Apparently, you called the police shortly before the attack. Is there anything you'd like to tell me? No. Both you and I know that these people are not joking. Please watch your back. Where's the photocopier? - How's Szymon? - He's in the ICU. - He lost a lot of blood. - I'll go there. They won't let you in. Tomorrow at the earliest. The meeting's in 15 minutes. We need to keep going. Right? Right, right... What are you doing? Piotrek! The guy who shot at you... He was the one who stabbed me. Do you get it? It's all connected. First Janiak, now this. Someone's covering up their tracks. - Do you have these documents? - Skalski does. You must reveal them. Only if you do will you be safe. Please, cancel your public appearances. - Hire a bodyguard. - Stop saying such things! Can't you see what's going on? Please. I have to go. Wait for five minutes before you leave. ...a shooting attack took place at the Revival office in Warsaw. At the press conference, an armed man started shooting at the Revival leaders. Two people were killed and another one was wounded. Two staff members were shot dead. The wounded man is in hospital now, reportedly in a critical condition. The wounded man is Szymon Bielik, an assistant to Anna Wagner. The reason for the shooting, though still unclear, may be linked to the picketing outside the Revival office. The Revival leaders were going to present the evidence for corruption in PM Kostrzewa's government. Now, it's unknown, however, when they will make it public... We have an ID on the attacker. He was a Polish soldier. Second Lt Artur Jonca, an Afghanistan and Iraq veteran. Lt Jonca had mental health issues related to combat experience. He was undergoing treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. Recently, he left treatment upon his own request. We've obtained a comment from the Prime Minister. Ladies and gentlemen. We can't have foreseen this tragedy. I am asking everyone, the politicians and the media, not to use this tragedy in the campaign out of respect for the victims and their families. Thank you. Well, we've heard a comment from PM Kostrzewa... 'A MAD SOLDIER' 'TRAINED TO KILL' POLISH FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN ARTUR JONCA: POLISH FORCES IN AFGHANISTAN THE BETA UNIT ENTERED AFGHANISTAN THE BETA UNIT: LT COLONEL ROBERT LEJMAN This is Grodecki. Your phone. What do you need a bodyguard for? Heard you wanted to meet her. - Why has she been following me? - That was her task. So, you do know him after all? - He trained Jonca, didn't he? - It doesn't mean anything. When I was working on the sex scandal case, - Jonca stabbed me. - Are you sure? What's his role in this? Robert Lejman. A former military man. Officially, one of Spectrum partners. And something I don't know? Kostrzewa's confidant whenever things need to be fixed. Like a defence tender? I need evidence. - Something we can publish. - Not from me. I thought we were supposed to help each other. - I'm a government agent. I can't. - Who can? The ones who lost. They know more than they say. Thanks. Prime Minister, you've repeatedly called for an end to hate speech. But a glaring example of hate speech is the campaign ad of your party. POLITICS IN TREATMENT HOSTED BY OLGA ROSINSKA Our ad is expressive, but it's not hate speech. There's a difference between an attack and a political dispute. The disrespect Ms Wagner showed to Poland's defence system required a blunt reply. Which the attacker must have heard. Ms Rosinska... He was a sick man. Claiming he was activated by one ad is going too far. I'm not saying it was one ad. You've been building your campaign on fear for months. - You're wrong, Ms Rosinska. - Thank you, Prime Minister... Let's go through tomorrow's agenda and call it a day. The morning press conference. You two come out - with Janiak's stuff. - There'll be time to use it. Did you see Kostrzewa? He's the one we should focus on. 'Kostrzewa is to blame for the attack.' A clear message. I'll call reporters outside our office. - We'll lay wreaths and... - Candles will be better. - You want to use the victims? - No other choice. We have solid evidence we can show. And we will. During the debate. It will kill him off. - This is how we'll proceed. - If you do... Count me out. - You want to win it or not? - I do, but not this way. I don't recognise you. For fuck's sake, Ania. We're a party, not a book club. You are to do what you're told. I expect to see you outside the office in the morning. - We'll start at ten. - What about Anna? What about her? POLAND DOESN'T NEED ANNA WAGNER THE LEFTIST PARTY OF FOOLS Poland doesn't need an army! Incoming call. Yes? Ania? Where is she? I can put it off for ten minutes. WEDNESDAY: 4 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION An hour ago, I met... ...the families of the victims. It was one of the hardest meetings in my life. This tragedy should not have happened. Had it not been for the rhetoric of Prime Minister Kostrzewa, these young people would still be among us. This government has many victims on its conscience. It has to stop. It has to stop. Where's Ms Wagner? It is our joint view. Why isn't she here with you? Yesterday's tragedy was a real shock for Anna. We should give her some time. Thank you. What about your campaign? Find her. Thank you. DEFENCE TENDER 'The consortium's chief competitor was The VICTORIA Arms Trade Group.' 'VICTORIA lost the tender: no offset deal for Silesia' 'Roman Hanus, VICTORIA's owner, calls for cancelling the tender' 'VICTORIA to collaborate with Arma-Com' 'VICTORIA to become an international player' OK, 'VICTORIA.' Got it. - What do you know about him? - Roman Hanus? - Engaged in the local social network. - Specifics? He got rich after the privatisation of a steelworks. Planned to enter the arms industry. Got his number? I'd like to meet him. - The guy enjoys his privacy. - I need half an hour to convince him. There's one thing you can do. - What's up? - I don't have a source. I know who and what, but I have no confirmation. So you have nothing. There's one guy, Roman Hanus. But I need your help. You have friends in common. Please follow me. Now you must go alone. - He won't talk if I'm around. - But you used to work together. 'Used to.' We produced subassemblies for his drones. He lost the tender and made friends with the winner. Why? In exchange for a contract for electronic components, they gave him a share in the Asian market. They bought him? Silence has its price, I guess. Press him. Olga promised me a powerful story. Ms Wagner? You're hard to find. - I called you but... - I'm sorry. I don't want to talk to the media right now. It's not a problem for Chairman Skalski. What do you want? I'd like you to come to my show tonight. You'll say what you were going to announce at the conference. - It's not the right moment. - Oh, indeed? These are the final days of the campaign. Looks like you have little time. Why don't you think it over? An informer in the arms industry? It's a death sentence. I'm sorry. You need to find someone else. No one knows as much as you do. We lost. That's it. - You filed a lawsuit. - I always do. I did my research. It was the first time. Are you really satisfied with what you got? Beg your pardon? If we prove the tender was rigged, they'll have to announce it again. What do you want to know? All right... Come on. I'll be right back. The latest defence tender. What was your role in it? The same as usual. Lobbying on behalf of the consortium. - There's nothing wrong with that. - Hanus claims you set up the tender. I know people. I introduce them. I present their offers in the best possible light. A lobbyist, Mr Grodecki, is a legitimate job. You influenced the expert opinions. Not so legitimate. You're overrating my role. Hanus says a lot of things. None of which is true. - Did you know Natalia Drabik? - Who? Minister Janiak's ex-assistant. - No. - Saw a video of you two talking. You only think you did. Is that all? Yes. To be continued in The Weekly. THE ARMA-COM CONSORTIUM DEFENCE TENDER: 12 BILLION 'PM Kostrzewa's government and Arma-Com set up a 12 billion defence tender for military drones.' 'It was one of the most expensive...' Hello? Yes. I thought we'd already gone through the hardest times. Szymon is dead. He'd been with us since the start. He worked hard. He worked very hard, often more than... Lovely speech. What do you want? Not here. The Prime Minister is waiting. Please wait here. Please come in. So nice to see you. Please take a seat. - Fancy a drink? - Water's fine. - Are you sure? - Yes. Gives you a hard time, right? The campaign. But your polls look promising. What's your point? If we strike a deal, I'll show you the rest. The rest? This is only a sample. I have a bagful of such nails. Why are you doing this? How much? - Wait a moment... - Ania... How much? I've heard you were very generous. Kind of awkward, isn't it? - How do you want to use it? - It's up to you. Mr Lejman will keep the tape to himself. And you'll keep Janiak's drivel to yourself. My people already know about it. If you have any authority in your party, show it now. Off you go. Come in. I agreed to do an interview in Rosinska's show. I'll talk about Janiak's documents. We can't reveal them. Kostrzewa knows we had a deal with Janiak. - What? - If they reveal the tape, we'll lose our credibility. You will lose yours. - Let's stick to the plan! - You wanted to win it. For fuck's sake, cut the crap! Cut the crap! I'm sorry. There's one thing I know. If it's revealed, all of us will lose. I think I'll go now. Didn't you lose your faith in politics? It's not a question of faith, but knowledge. People are being killed, including your assistant. - The doctors couldn't save him. - It's a bad time to discuss it. What about the documents you were to reveal at the conference? We will reveal them. At the right moment. The election is in four days. We should know the truth. Yes. But not at any price. Yesterday's tragedy proved what a media hunt might lead to. We'll hand the evidence to the services without turning it into a media show. I have only one question then. How did you obtain these documents? Unfortunately, we did it by breaking the rules of our party. You mean illegally. Revival will introduce new standards into our political world. I strongly objected to the way in which we got hold of the evidence. We won't use it in the campaign. That's brave. Will the voters appreciate it? - Why don't we give them a chance? - Thank you. I've been talking to Revival's Anna Wagner. Good night. You're a fast learner. But this was not our deal. Goodbye. - Does anyone know about it? - No. And you didn't get it from me. How are you holding up? It's just a few more days. Look... Yesterday, at the hotel... Let's not talk about it, please. Where did you get this? - Told you. Hanus. - I'm asking about Janiak's documents. - I have to know before it runs. - Revival. Skalski? Fuck, look at her new standards. She's clever. Let's post a teaser on our website. JANIAK'S WILL... 'PUBLISH THE ARTICLE?' 'NO/YES' 'READY' Yes? You seen it? - What's this? - It will run in tomorrow's issue. JANIAK'S WILL: SECRETS OF THE DEFENCE TENDER I'll destroy her. Incoming call from: Andrzej. Hello? Hi! Don't publish it. Why not? I've read the teaser. This story is much bigger. What do you mean exactly? We have to see someone. I'm coming to the office. - Andrzej, wait... - Trust me. I'll be at Wschodni in 30 minutes. Andrzej says we can't run the story. - What? Why? - Don't know. - He wouldn't say. - But the issue went to print. So hold it. I'll go and pick him up. You've got one hour. This is Andrzej Bitner. Please leave a message after the tone.
