Not now. - I can't withhold it any further. - Someone killed him. - You don't know that. He tried to tell us something. And then, he died. - It's not necessarily connected. - We fucking need to check it. The article will be published in tomorrow's issue.

 I don't fucking get you. You so badly want to hit Kostrzewa? - The facts are on our side. - Yours? Sure. Piotr is right. There is no coincidence. If you find out more about it, you'll get a special issue. UNKNOWN USER: 'WM 30021 SILVER FORD MONDEO' UNKNOWN USER HAS LEFT THE CONVERSATION I had to do it. Darek... - This party is also mine. - No, it's not. What's your powerbase? Who supports you? How many people did you select for our ballot? If we get into the Sejm, nobody will back you up.

 Nobody. REPORTER FOUND DEAD ANDRZEJ BITNER HAS DIED The documents check out. - You wrote the truth. - Which one is able to kill? Everyone. This tender involves billions of zlotys. - Drop it. - They fucking killed him! You wanna be next? They already know you. If you dig in it, they'll take you out. Who might have sent the Natalia video? None of us, I think. Spectrum's IT didn't find anything. Why? My informer got in touch with me again. It all started with him. She lied to me and she must pay for that. It wasn't my decision. You don't have to let the audio out. I think the Prime Minister is of a different opinion. But he's not the one who keeps the tape, right? We can still make a deal. After we win, I'll need people like you. First, you need to win. When the story gets published, Kostrzewa will cut off from you anyway. What about you? What guarantee do I have that you'll keep your promise? What do you want? Hi. He pissed me off terribly. When I started out, he didn't publish my articles. My first story ran after ten months. Then he took me out drinking. For the first time. He held out his hand and said... 'You've just become a journalist.' And he puked on my shoes. They recorded me. They recorded me and now I'm being blackmailed. What am I supposed to do about it? - Hush it up. - How? Here's the telephone number of the man who has the recording. And his price. Is this a joke? If you want us to reach the finish line together... You have to get the money. We'll manage. Fancy a drink? We have little time. Start acting now. Andrzej Bitner, a renowned journalist, died last night at the age of 73. He was an icon of the underground press. What mattered to Andrzej was the truth. First in Kurier, then in The Weekly. We will all miss him. ANDRZEJ BITNER DIED OF A HEART ATTACK The Weekly has published evidence for corruption in the government. Grodecki claims the tender committee was bribed and the procedure rigged. The bribe concerned a defence tender for the acquisition of drones. Janiak's documents provide proof of the crime. We have no comment from Congress or PM Kostrzewa himself. In an hour, the party will hold a press conference. It may be the end of Kostrzewa. The election is in three days. Should Kostrzewa attack now? Everything depends on today's debate. The leaders of two main parties will meet for a debate tonight. - They're neck and neck in the polls. - Revival may soon take a lead. The debate's winner may win the election. THURSDAY: 3 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION PM Kostrzewa hasn't commented on the accusations yet. But his campaign staff plans to file an election lawsuit against The Weekly. If Congress has time to do that, go ahead. But the results of our investigation leave no room for interpretation. Just check the story in today's Weekly. The Weekly may now be accused of trying to affect the election results. We got evidence for corruption. Were we supposed to hold it back? It would've been convenient for the PM, but it's not how The Weekly operates. The campaign people are freaking out. I thought we might succeed without secret documents, bribes and all that crap. You'll manage. This is what you want after all. - It was a mistake. - What was a mistake? We should've met at your place. ...winds out of the north will make it feel chillier. Tomorrow will bring no surprises... Make yourself comfortable. Extensive limb swelling. Myocardial necrosis caused by the occlusion to the left anterior descending artery. Meaning? An anterior wall myocardial infarction. Today's Weekly. Have you read it yet? I browsed through it. 'Janiak's will: the secrets of the defence tender.' Can you comment on this story, please? - To my alarm, it didn't surprise me. - Why not? This government has accustomed us to the worst type of corruption. While Revival is... 'a breath of fresh air in politics'? So you've read our leaflet. Yes, it's true. Is it possible to bring it about on purpose? If you want to, anything's possible. But the tox showed nothing. He was an elderly man. The Weekly materials, are these the same documents Revival got hold of? I'd rather not comment on this. As Ms Wagner said, we didn't want to use them in our campaign. Because you obtained them illegally? We operated entirely within the law. - You're sure of that? - Absolutely. Deputy PM Janiak gave us the documents - out of concern for Poland. - Let's listen then. I have a bagful of such nails. Why are you doing this? - How much? - Wait a moment... Ania... How much? - What's this? - Thank you. The offer expires at 6 p.m. Kostrzewa will pay twice as much for this. Sort it out between you two. Ania... Why didn't you pay him? It doesn't work this way, Darek. You screwed it up. I didn't promise I'd pay him. I told you we'd manage. Listen to me. You set me up, get it? Together we decided it would be better this way. Who decided? What do you think? Fancy a shot? - What time is the debate rehearsal? - There's no rehearsal. - What are you talking about? - No rehearsal! We're back to square one. They're gonna kill us with that tape. - You're fucking freaking out? - Me? - We're ahead of Kostrzewa. - We were! You seen the latest polls? - Fix a studio for the rehearsal. - Do it yourself. Darek... - He's right. It's a bad idea. - What is? - Your taking part in the debate. - You got a better solution? Oh please, it's ridiculous. Your lie will dominate the message. - He'll eat you alive. - You'll be to blame if we lose. I'm clean. In Rosinska's show, I cut off from the documents. It's a good idea, Darek. Damn. That is so clever of you. We have no other choice now. Darek, can you hear me? Shit! They'll take him for observation. - For how long? - Until the end of the week. Keep the change. Thanks. ...a teaser of a major profile story that we'll run in the next issue and... - What's this? - They fixed it under my car. - Who did? - Have no fucking idea! Yesterday, I left the office and someone followed me. My informer tipped me off. He sent me the plates numbers. How? - How did he tip you off? - I get messages through an IM app. - Did you try to locate him? - I did. No success. I've got someone who will handle it. It might be the special services. I need your phone. Here's Kostrzewa. Here's you. - Shall we start? - Uh-huh. Wait. - No, no! - It's too hot. Put it back on. You won't take it off at the debate. Ready? A mine in Bytom, Silesia, has been on strike for a few days. Revival's view on that? Silesia has always been exploited by the authorities. No. You are the authorities too. Watch your words. Today's situation results from years of negligence. From ignorance of the central government. From the lack of vision of Warsaw decision makers. Too official. It's your topic. What are your plans? Silesia needs our energy. Silesia needs our energy and greater... Silesia needs... Silesia needs our energy. Greater attention. An overall strategy that would help its inhabitants. Too general. Show him you come from that place. - Bytom is my hometown... - Don't look down. I know them. I understand their needs. So Revival... - Told you not to look down! - Screw you! Defence. He'll refer to your comment on the army. I was never against investing in defence. - Attack. - The PM's party - distorted my statements. - Don't feel sorry for yourself. Every year, we lose billions because the current government... Don't glance at the camera. We lose billions of zlotys because the government yields to the pressure of lobbyists. Our arms companies get orders - from all countries except Poland. - Stop. That's something specific. Now translate it into emotions. Polish employees don't get this money. It's the PM's fault. Turn it into a sound bite they can use in the news. The PM prefers to contribute to foreign economies than our market. Don't cut down on your emotions. Excuse me. Yes? It's not the best moment. I understand. There's someone to see you. If it's so urgent, I'm listening. - Congratulations. - I don't understand. On taking power. Is this supposed to be a joke? The Prime Minister hasn't seen them yet. And it can stay this way. What do you want? Nothing. So what's the point of our meeting? When you form the government, you'll need me. - To do things like this? - Our cooperation will be fruitful. No. You still have a few hours left. The choice is yours. Nicely played, indeed. Skalski is history. Now the photos and emails... And you're all gone. It's an offer. - Maybe it can still be undone? - How? I don't know! He's probably playing his game on two fronts, meeting Kostrzewa right now. What should I do? There is a way. What is it? You have to cut ties with me. At the debate, tell them you didn't know about my materials. You're a victim of my investigation. - You're nuts. - You have to do it. - So I'm supposed to pin it on you? - It doesn't matter now. It's absurd. I have to go now. Bye. Did you order these? Looks like his nerves are shattered. If you don't know who's gonna win, you place your bets on everyone. I need to see him. What do you want? The same thing as everyone. Peace and quiet. You won't do it. - This offer is good and honest. - You're gonna be held responsible. For the shooting attack and Jonca. I'll find the proof and ruin you. Mr Bitner's death. Didn't it teach you anything? You keep walking on their leash. Whose? I don't know. But I know why now. Four years of peace. People get a bit nervous when it comes to power. - Ready? - Always. - It's going to hurt. - Pardon? Good luck. This strategic region has always been a priority for my government. Thank you, sir. Now Ms Anna Wagner. You have one minute to respond. It won't take that long. The Prime Minister has been talking for years. But no action follows. One sentence will be enough. You're telling porkies! This is how Silesians describe liars. Our next topic is defence. You said that Poland didn't need an army. Do you still hold this controversial opinion? Poland deserves a strong army. But one that uses Polish weapons. We lose billions of zlotys because the government doesn't order arms from national companies. Sir, how does it happen that Polish arms companies get orders from all countries except Poland? We pay workers from Germany, France and the USA. Yet, we might as well support Polish employees and their families. The money might stay in Poland, contributing to the national economy. Unfortunately, PM Kostrzewa preferred to look after his clients' army! There's nothing to laugh about, sir. Recently, we could all read about the latest defence tender procedure. - Who do you represent? - Pardon? - Whose interest are you acting in? - Please, respect our rules here, sir. I apologize. The procurement process was fairly conducted. Whoever made a mistake will face the consequences in court. The next question also concerns defence. Can you comment on the Weekly investigation? The article raises serious allegations of corruption. The evidence collected by the reporters looks reliable. Not in this case. Of course, Ms Wagner promotes the revival of politics... - It wasn't my investigation. - But you controlled it. I see I have no choice but to say it. Ms Wagner is in a romantic relationship with the author of this article. So it leaves no doubt that the Weekly article was written on Revival's political order. So I'm asking: what revival of politics are you after? We must not be fooled by the idea that Revival is a breath of fresh air in Polish politics. Yes. It's true. I was in a relationship with a Weekly journalist, Piotr Grodecki. It's not a secret. - We split up recently. - He managed to run the story before. I never wanted to talk about my personal life. But I believe both my voters and political opponents have the right to know the truth. We split up because of principles. Piotr Grodecki... He abused my trust. Exploiting our relationship, he came into possession of the documents that he used without my knowledge. And it was over between us. It wasn't an easy decision, but I had to take it. I learnt my lesson. People who will understand me are those who once put absolute trust in another person but then regretted having done so. The voters should demand more from their politicians. And we must demand more from ourselves. I believe that Revival is the only chance to improve our country. We will improve Poland. Any explanation? None? We split up before she got into big politics. Who cares? What counts is here and now. Now your entire story loses its credibility. - Told you not to publish it. - That's funny! But all of us are in deep shit now. - It's Seidler. - Take it. You two have a chat. Hello? The debate is now over. Who's the winner? An interesting debate with strong arguments. - Kostrzewa played all his cards. - That's why he lost. Our viewers believe the outright winner is Anna Wagner. - 68% versus 32%. - She's natural, rational. A real leader. Revival convinced hesitant voters. Wagner showed the human touch. She won the debate and proved she could be the Revival's new leader. WAGNER 69%, KOSTRZEWA 31% A POSITIVE CHANGE? LET'S VOTE! WHO WILL WIN THE DEBATE? KOSTRZEWA - SURPRISINGLY WEAK. NO PILLS TODAY? Certainly. Mr Seidler will see you now. - You lied to us. - I had my reasons. All right. Let's drop it. Here's your chance to make amends. Here's the IP address of your informer. And his current coordinates. - I'll find him there, right? - He was there an hour ago. Thanks. How did you track me down? - An IP address. - Was anyone following you? - No. - You sure? You didn't notice yesterday. What was the point of that show? Of asking me 'who sent the video' questions? Told you. I work for the government. I can't get involved. - But that had to be revealed. - And I did reveal it. So what is this all about? Why is Andrzej dead? This is something I don't get myself. - Why did you send him to Silesia? - I fucking didn't! Did he tell you what he found there? - No. - So what did he look for? Don't know, but it isn't about Silesia. Oh yes. Sure. UNKNOWN USER: THEY TRACKED ME DOWN. WHO DID? DON'T TRUST ERYK. Everything all right? Yeah. It's my boss. I had to let her know where I was and with whom. It was stupid of you. That's the protocol. After Andrzej's death, we have to be more careful. So you don't know anything? I'll let you know when I find something. The IM app, OK? OK. Let's do it.
