 directed by I'm Eryk Nosol. I run the ISA CI Division. Why's the ISA handling this case? The sex scandal you wrote about made the Polish government collapse. Isn't that enough? Now there's strong suspicion that the scandal was staged. - Who's behind it? - We hope you'll help us find it out. Me? I know nothing. Yes? - I saw the video. - What video? Who planted you? You lied to me. - Are you there? - I can't talk about it on the phone.

 - I'll be at your place in 30 minutes. - What video? Do you wiretap reporters? We wiretap people who might undermine Poland's security. - Like me? - Like Natalia Drabik. If she was under your surveillance, you shouldn't have let her die. Tell me about the video. Your password, please. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ARTICLE ERROR 404 - FILE NOT FOUND Who sent you this? I don't know this person. We have to seize your notebook and your mobile. Is that all? Do you know him? Is that all? I was tricked like a fool. Fuck! - You can't have foreseen it. - Sure. You can't take it back. What's the point of all of this? The call history. We need to check whom Natalia called yesterday. OK. I'll handle it. Here's my new number. Get a fucking grip on yourself. Don't disappear on me again. Yes? I'd like to talk. - Who is it? - Piotr Grodecki. Go fuck yourself. - What do you want? - Natalia is dead. She was murdered. - What? - Someone planted her in your office. Who might have wanted that? Who the fuck framed you into this? Get the fuck out of here. I'm sorry. Poland doesn't need an army! Revival! Revival! THE TRUTH ABOUT SO-CALLED REVIVAL! WHAT DOES ANNA WAGNER MEAN? TERRORIST ATTACKS WARS Poland doesn't need doesn't need an army! POLISH CONSTITUTION: The Army protects citizens from acts of terror as well as saves lives and provides support in natural disasters. Our struggle is pointless! WHY SHOULD WE VOTE FOR THEM? We are alone... alone... To keep you in fear. WE CAN'T LET IT HAPPEN! I made a mistake. WE CAN'T AFFORD MISTAKES VOTE RESPONSIBLY AND SAFELY ON SUNDAY The Liberty Congress TUESDAY: 5 DAYS UNTIL THE ELECTION Motherfuckers. They're simply efficient. That's terrible. You should have listened to me. Always stick to the script. Wait... Let's sue them. Let's file an election lawsuit. - Let's post the original video. - Who cares anyway? You can't take it back now. Everyone has to eat a bowl of shit sooner or later. Hello? Here? Now? OK. Fine. We have a visitor. - What is this about? - Information. What information? An invoice issued by a tender committee member. And his worthless expert opinion. It proves Kostrzewa rigged the procurement procedure. You will drown the son of a bitch. Check it out. If we strike a deal, I'll show you the rest. - The rest? - This is only a sample. I have a bagful of such nails. Why are you doing this? How much? - Wait a moment... - Ania... How much? Thank you. My offer expires at 6 p.m. Kostrzewa will pay twice as much for this. Sort it out between you two. You know the poll results. - No one achieved so much so quickly. - Is that enough for you? - So it's better to buy some dirt? - I didn't make it up! Darek, it wasn't part of our deal. Ania... - What will it contain? - Recaps, analyses... Nothing solid? - We need to talk. - Not now. It's urgent. Gentlemen, I don't think you've met. - Grodecki. - Łukasz Seidler. Our new owner. Sorry, it's really important. You'd better find some hard data. We need to run a story about her involvement. - What for? - Because it was a set-up. Do you have the video file to confirm it? So we won't write about Natalia at all? A conspiracy theory a few days before the election? - People should know, right? - I have no reason to spread false rumours. For now, Natalia is an innocent victim of the government's sex scandal. An innocent victim of the government's sex scandal? We haven't got anything yet. She doesn't want to dig in it at all. It feels like fucking Kurier again. A short, neutral note about her death. That's all we can post on our website. She promised something else when she convinced us to work here. When she convinced you. And take it out of here. Do you have the call history? The ISA lay their hands on it. ISA? ...ex-Deputy PM's assistant. Last night, she allegedly committed suicide. Drabik's body was discovered by a Weekly reporter, Piotr Grodecki. It was in his article that Drabik revealed the sex scandal. ...months ago, she accused Janiak of sexual harassment... A former assistant to Deputy PM Janiak committed suicide... It caused the collapse of the government and the early election. - The PM remains strong. - But Revival keeps closing the gap. Wagner and Skalski did the impossible. In four months, they emerged as the second strongest party in Poland. Five days until the election, the rhetorical heat is turned up. Poland doesn't need an army! Afghanistan veteran: I feel slapped by Wagner. We haven't seen such an ugly campaign for a long time. - The PM wants to split Poland. - Wagner went too far. The nationalists will boycott her party. Kostrzewa's ad is a strong blow to Revival. The number you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. It will be here in a moment. A380. In ten minutes. I'm a bit pressed for time. You don't know what you're missing. Have you got it? You'll make a great prime minister. Not with the current polls. Everyone's working hard to change them. Just like that? Poland needs positive change. You were pressed for time. UNKNOWN I KNOW WHO DID IT. WHO? I KNOW. YOUR MOBILE NUMBER. NEW MESSAGE: UNKNOWN UNKNOWN: CARRIAGE NO. 5330 173 This is Sebastian Malik. Please leave a message after the tone. Let go of me! - You killed her. - Let go of me! Her last call before she died was for you. - What are you talking about? - Natalia. I haven't been in touch with her for months. - Who did it? - Let go of me. Name! Let go of me... I'll fucking kill you. I'll fucking kill you if you lie. - Sebastian wouldn't have done it. - He's involved in her death somehow. - No. - He gave me no explanation. - You can't be serious. - Telling lies is his job. It doesn't mean he's involved in a murder. What kind of bullshit is this? Here, read it. 'We supervise negotiations, improve the effectiveness of decisions, establish strategic contacts, and identify market trends.' We know whom to bribe and whom to scare. Any trace they provide services for the PM Chancellery? None. Looks like there are official and unofficial clients. You won't regret it. Obtaining these documents incriminates me and only me. You don't know anything about it. This defence tender took offset deals away from your town. - What do you want? - Clean up the mess you made. We'll switch our message about the army. This ad issue, I'm sure you'll bounce back. You'll reveal it at a press conference. Yes? Hello? It's me. Hi. - How's it going? - Your mobile is broken, isn't it? Long story. I've heard about Natalia. Let's meet. What for? Hi. What's up? Janiak paid us a visit. What did he want? It was about Kostrzewa. Janiak's got some dirt on him. What dirt? Skalski wants me to say it at a press conference. Did you buy it? Cool. Piotrek... It concerns the latest defence tender. - He's got evidence they set it up. - Who did? - Natalia's dead. - I can't! Piotrek... I don't understand you. I can see that. What time is the conference? Patryk! Call everyone... What's wrong with you? Darek? What's wrong with you? It's OK. Pass me some water. Let's keep working. Wakey-wakey. Andrzej! Andrzej. DEFENCE TENDER 2015 ARMA-COM WINS THE LARGEST DEFENCE TENDER IN YEARS Bingo. Listen to this. The latest defence tender, which was staged, was won by the Arma-Com Concern, Spectrum's client. Get it? - How do you know it was staged? - I just do. - From what source? - A reliable one. Let's say, the defence tender was in fact rigged. And Spectrum did help produce an outcome favourable to the government. We still don't know how it links to Natalia. It's a huge story. We need to go back to Sebastian. - Count me out. - What's going on? - Personal issues. - Andrzej! It's important. I had nothing to do with her death. The call history confirms it. Nah, I've already got one call history. Mine's authentic. What's authentic is the video of Natalia. What video? The one in which she's instructed when and how to drag Janiak to bed. The article is ready. You'll be famous. Piotrek! Specifics. - Natalia was a plant. - Who recruited her? Lejman. One of our partners. But we didn't kill her! - Who did? - I don't know. I really don't. What about Janiak? Either you tell me or you're gonna read about yourself. He kept tabs on offset deals. The latest defence tender, right? The women were supposed to be a blackmail tool. Why? He got his share for the tender but wanted more. He blackmailed Kostrzewa by threatening to break the coalition. And? - And someone took Natalia over. - Who? I would like to know that myself. I swear I don't know! I never thought I'd live to see it. You've just become my source. Sebastian started to talk. Andrzej, what's going on? The transfer to The Weekly is the best thing that happened to me. - I don't feel like doing it anymore. - What kind of bullshit is this? And you, does it make you feel good? Can you please tell me where you're going? A friend of mine has cancer. He'll be gone soon. I'm sorry. When are you coming back? Will you give me a moment to say goodbye to him? - Thanks. - Take care. - Natalia was a plant. - Who recruited her? Lejman. One of our partners. - But we didn't kill her. - Who did? I don't know... I really don't. - What about Janiak? - He kept tabs on offset deals. The latest defence tender, right? The women were supposed to be a blackmail tool. Why? He got his share for the tender but wanted more. He blackmailed Kostrzewa by threatening to break the coalition. - And? - And someone took Natalia over. My source says Janiak's documents that incriminate Kostrzewa will be revealed at Revival's conference today. You were right. So we're running it? You've got two days. Excellent work. - Janiak paid us a visit. - He kept tabs on offset deals. He got his share for the tender but wanted more. ...a political game played by Madam Mayor of Bytom. The inquiry at the Ministry revealed nothing. - I can speak only for myself. - He's got evidence they set it up. Here's another one. PIOTR: JANIAK'S DEAD. - What happened? - I'm not sure. It must have something to do with those documents. - Postpone the conference. - But... What for? They're ours now. Ania, call it off. - No, no, it's too late. - Trust me, please! - Piotrek, it's absurd. - Give me the documents. I'll post them online and you'll just comment on them. - You'll use them for your own goals? - For fuck's sake, Anka! I would do it anonymously. - Piotrek, the conference is at 6 p.m. - You can't stick your neck out! Bye. I shouldn't be doing this. Just a few more days. You don't believe what you're saying. Has Patryk scanned the documents? Did you secure them? Ania? What's up? Janiak's dead. Oh fuck. What happened? Let's not play it out. Why not? The documents check out. - But... - Ania, listen to me. It's too late to change anything, OK? We're sticking to the plan. Is that clear? Is that clear? WOJCIECH JANIAK HAS DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES '...HEART ATTACK AT HOME...' '...FACING A FAIR TRIAL AFTER DEATH...' '...LET'S NOT FORGET HIS VICTIMS...' What really happened to him? Have you got anything? What is it? Tell me. An internal CCTV video. You and Janiak outside his house. Swapping a bag for an envelope. Does anyone else know about it? This video... Is the killer in it too? Looks like Janiak was visited only by two persons today. That reporter, Grodecki, and then you. Nobody else? Find out who did it. Free Poland! Strong army! ...alleged proof of criminal activity of Kostrzewa's ministers. In a few minutes, it will be revealed at a press conference. Emotions rise high as Revival's opponents are picketing here. They accuse Revival of trying to destroy Poland. People gathered here, including many reporters, are waiting for 6 p.m. when the Revival leaders present the mysterious documents. As for the current poll results, Revival is 14 points behind the leader. Ania... - If you don't want to, don't do it. - Beg your pardon? Especially now, when Janiak's dead. - In this situation... - Look. If I need advice, I'll let you know, OK? This is Anna Wagner. Please leave a message... Do we know what to do? Have you got the scans? OK, let's go. Free Poland! Strong army! Ladies and gentlemen, the conference will begin shortly. Please take your seats.
