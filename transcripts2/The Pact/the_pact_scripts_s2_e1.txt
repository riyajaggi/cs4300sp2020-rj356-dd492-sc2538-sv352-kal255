 - I've already made up my mind. - Natalia, hold on... I won't do it. You want to fix him or not? Just tell me. Let's meet tomorrow and talk it over. OK. Thanks. You surprised? She's scared. She knows well we've got nothing without her name. No, Andrzej, don't worry. She'll manage. Gotta go. Bye. Uh-huh... Well, then... Uh-huh... Oh, put it there, please! No, it's room service.

 I'll send you an amendment. But tell them it's way over the town budget. Thanks, bye! Hi. Just one second. I've had enough of this secrecy. The article was published three months ago. I'll give you the key. Next time, we'll meet at my place. Pick it up. Yes? Like, now? Calm down. What's going on? All right. Where are you? Yes. See you. Trouble with Natalia. - I have to go. - Uh-huh... Bye. Who did you tell about me? No one. Just like I promised. Who knows about me? - A colleague from my paper. - Fuck. - Calm down. He won't tell anyone. - 'Calm down'... - So why are they following me? - Who is? Someone was outside my house. Then on the underground. I thought I lost them. - But... - What? It's been parked here since I came in. It's gonna be fine. What are you doing? Go! You can sleep in here. I'll get you a blanket. - Where's the bathroom? - Over there. We can't wait any longer. You have to testify. No. - It's the only way to keep you safe. - How do you picture that exactly? - My family knows nothing about it. - So we'll go and prepare them. You know you have to finish it. Fine, we'll talk about it tomorrow. Now go to sleep, have some rest. YOU HAVE 7 MISSED CALLS FROM: ANNA WAGNER This is Anna Wagner. Please leave a message after the tone. - How bad is it? - The entire drift is blocked. - How many men are there? - Thirty-six underground. They should get psychological first aid as soon as possible. I can only guess what you're going through right now. I promise you'll be the first to know about the progress of the rescue mission. I'm asking you to be patient. We have a long, hard night ahead of us. Rescuers are struggling to reach the miners. Because of the adverse conditions, it is unknown how long it will take. Thirty-six miners are trapped underground. Up here, their families are desperately waiting for any news. The blast in the Brygida mine in Bytom took place today at 7.30 p.m. MAYOR OF BYTOM ANNA WAGNER ON THE BLAST SITE Mr Wysocki... Someone has to tell them. May I have your attention, please? The rescuers struggled all night. They managed to get through but it was too late. Out of respect for the victims and families, I won't make any comments. These accusations were already voiced a few months ago. Neither you as a Deputy PM nor your colleagues would hear them. It's not the right time to discuss it. The Weekly ran a story on the problems at the mine. - It's time you read it. - But I did. It was only a political game played by Madam Mayor of Bytom. The inquiry at the Ministry revealed nothing. Is it an official Government stand? For now, I can speak only for myself... Hi. How are you holding up? Ania? How's Natalia? She's OK now. Good. I have to go. I'll call you back. Ania, wait... Our guest today was Minister of Economy and Deputy PM, Wojciech Janiak. - Thank you. - Thank you, I'm Olga... Don't think about him. I'll handle things at the paper and be right back. Don't go anywhere, OK? Piotr... Thanks. THE WEEKLY Hi! - And? - She's safe. You coming? PM Kostrzewa is on his way to the mine... Come in! - Piotr, you'll go to Silesia. - I can't. - It's your story. Call your source. - We have something else. No more freewheeling like in Kurier. You're going to Silesia. What else do you want to find there? - Sorry? - Every reporter got the same story. So let's pass over the biggest blast in years? - Send anyone. - Piotr has contacts there. He has something more important here and now. What is it? Natalia Drabik. An assistant to Janiak for four months. After she quit, she was replaced by Justyna Prus. She jumped out of the window. Natalia knows why she killed herself. This creep harasses women. First, he employs them. And then, he offers them a job for sex. - We need her statement on camera. - It can be done. Get a comment from Janiak. And write a story. It's no longer only the Ministry. Add the blast to the mix, and the coalition collapses. Look at his cute jacket. Let's go. My condolences. - What do you want? - To help you. The Prime Minister counts on your cooperation. If I were you, I'd do as he says. Thank you for coming. Ladies and gentlemen. First, I'd like to offer my condolences to the families of the victims. But also to the management of the mine and Madam Mayor. And to all those who fought until the end. It is an enormous tragedy that we couldn't prevent. Because certain things are unpredictable. We could. We could have prevented it. Yes, indeed. As you remember, a few months ago, Madam Mayor openly discussed irregularities in the mine and got the support of our government. Excuse me, you're economical with the truth, Prime Minister. All reports were forwarded to you. But Warsaw sent us refusal decisions. You and your Chancellery have this on your conscience. Excuse me. Sir, can you comment on these accusations? Is it true, sir? Madam Mayor is torn by strong emotions. We must understand it. Bravo! It was an excellent speech. You gained five minutes of fame. Is there anything else I can do for you, sir? A committee of inquiry will be set up, so you can expect an interrogation. In that case, see you soon. You've done so much for this town. What a pity. Can you wait for me in the car, please? Piotrek? - How have you been? - Hi. Are you and Andrzej playing political games now? If you feel like talking about the old times... Call me, will you? We'll grab a beer. Gotta go. - It was great to see you. - You too. Good morning, Minister. Can we talk? Please schedule a meeting through my office. - I did. Three times. - Keep trying. You know today is not a good day. I wanted to talk about your assistant. I no longer comment on that. It's not a political issue but a drama of this girl and her family. But I'm talking about Natalia Drabik. Two minutes. - Do you mind? - Go ahead. Natalia Drabik claims you forced her to provide you with sexual services in exchange for keeping her job. Would you care to comment? - You are joking. - No. It's her official statement. - Evidence? - E-mails, e-chats, photos. - I'd like to see them. - You will. In The Weekly. Is there anything you'd like to add? No. It's a load of nonsense. Fine. I won't bother you. You seem to be in a hurry. - Whose puppet are you? - Goodbye, Minister. I'm talking to you! You hear me? You drive into my lane again and I'll fucking kill you. You are gone. Hi, Andrzej. We've got it. ANNA WAGNER: THE PERSON WHO DEFEATED PM KOSTRZEWA MY GOVERNMENT HAS NOTHING ON ITS CONSCIENCE Add more quotes and we'll run it. I need two or three days to talk to Natalia. - You're joking, right? - I must prepare her. - But it's a good story for now. - I promised her. The conference is tomorrow morning. - What are you doing here? - Need to talk. - Not now. - Trust me. For you, now's better. - You sure? - No, thanks. When Andrzej brought us here - after our first story... - What is this about? Natalia Drabik. Who is she? Please... - How do you know about her? - Doesn't matter. Listen. We both know what will happen to her when this case is revealed. - What exactly? - Piotrek... - What if she wants it? - Sure. But when it all gets fucked up, you'll be the only winner. - Thanks for coffee. - Hold on, Piotrek. Janiak is a real prick. And he has to pay, I fully agree. But the cards can be played differently. He'll have quit by the end of the month. And he'll never come back. You have my word. Natalia will receive compensation. Nice of you to care about her. This government won't survive two blows in one day. And we can't afford to end the coalition right now. Who can't afford it? This is a good offer. Someone was trying to scare her lately. Piotruś... I'm talking to you because we know each other well. But you do realise if it's necessary, we'll hush her up. It's on me. Natalia? Natalia! Hi, this is Natalia, leave a message. Fuck. Hi, this is Natalia... Love, we have a guest! Hi. Seba said he saw you. - You haven't met Junior. - Hi... Say 'Hi'. - I'll get you a drink. - No, thanks. - Wanted to talk for a second. - Yeah, what about? - Where is Natalia? - What do you mean? At the bar, you threatened you'd hush her up. - Will you watch him? - Sure. Come on. - What are you talking...? - Enough of this bullshit. OK, I agree. What you said at the bar about Janiak and Natalia, let's do it. - Sorry but it was a one-time offer. - What? It's no longer valid. What have you done to her? You're being paranoid or what? Piotruś... We had a nice lunch together. Let's not spoil that. You think you're so clever? Get the fuck out of here. All right. The conference is cancelled. We're withholding the story for now. 'For now' meaning what exactly? Until she returns. And you didn't report it to the police? We'd kill the story if we did. We don't know what's happening to her. Exactly. Maybe she got scared and ran away. And you want to take a risk, don't you? Yes. And it's not your story, get it? Piotr? Let's put it off for one more day. Natalia! Natalia! Listen... We need to figure out Plan B at last. - Cut it out. - What if we never see Natalia again? Maybe we should launch what we have on Janiak? Piotr, look at yourself. Get some rest. Just this once. Ten days after the mining accident, the Sejm committee of inquiry starts proceedings to examine the causes of the blast at the Brygida mine in Bytom. One of the first witnesses to be interrogated is the Mayor of Bytom, Anna Wagner. She was the one who accused the government of neglecting the safety issues at the mine. NATALIA: THE NUMBER IS NOW AVAILABLE Where are you? Doesn't matter. Where are you? OK, stay there. Told you I wasn't fit for that. But you've come back. - Just don't lie that it will be fine. - It won't. You may change the town, the look, the name... But everyone will know who you are. It's never going to stop. - Is this how you want to convince me? - No. It's your choice. - You said a statement only. - She'll answer questions too. - I'll handle them. - You did your job. Now it's my turn. We can't throw her in at the deep end. She agreed to a conference. No more preferential treatment. Are we clear? Ready? Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our press conference on the sex scandal in the government. A SEX SCANDAL IN THE GOVERNMENT DEPUTY PM TO BE DISMISSED, GOVERNMENT IN TROUBLE. ELECTION? 'ONCE I SAW THE MINISTER KISS JUSTYNA. WHAT COULD I DO?' This is all we've got. You can't take or copy it. You can see it only here and now. Actually, you don't even see it. - But there's nothing in here. - Darek... I could've died. You said Kostrzewa was hiding something. - Is this all the ISA has got? - The ISA, the CBI, the CBA. And there's nothing at all? For now, there's no will to launch the investigation. There's no will... Until Kostrzewa is there, we won't find anything. Don't worry. It won't take long. Hello. Are these reliable? No. We already have a strategy. How did you inform the government about inaccuracies in the mine? Cyclical reports were sent straight to the Prime Minister's Chancellery. The government gave their decision on the basis of expert analyses. - Correct? - Yes. So the Chancellery not only replied to your reports but it also set up a special committee to analyse them. I worked for them for six years. Trust me, if you want to win, give them something they don't expect. Thanks, but no. - You didn't even appeal. - The analyses were classified. I was unable to appeal. So you let the miners climb down deeper despite a serious hazard? - Good luck. - Thanks. As I said before, the analyses were classified. Including the experts' identities. Only recently have I been able to discover their names. All three of them have links to the Prime Minister's party. And all three of them were promoted soon after preparing their analyses. Prime Minister Kostrzewa not only knew about the problem in the mine but even used his people to hush it up. Don't mention that. - If it hadn't been for your... - It was only a bonus. You're the one who made it. Ania... There's something I'd like to talk to you about. The government scandal continues. The Liberty Congress says their coalition with the Peasants' Party will be over. The decision's been brought about by the story in today's Weekly. The Peasants' leader, Wojciech Janiak, allegedly harassed sexually his assistants. As a result, one of them, Justyna Prus, committed suicide. Thanks. Really. Not many people would have done what you did. What are you gonna do now? No idea. No idea. - Bye then. - Take care. Following the mining accident, it's been the second major blow to PM Kostrzewa's government. The Opposition plans to file a motion of no confidence. PM Kostrzewa will address the nation to make an official announcement about the end of the coalition and, in consequence, the collapse of the government. You missed the address to the nation. You destroyed the government. Natalia. She did. Hi. Hi... I've been unpacking my things... The bedroom, the living room, the kitchen. You're a fan of minimalism. Coffee or tea? We need to talk. Should I be scared? It's about Skalski. We've met today and... Is he getting ready for the election? He's setting up a political party. And he wants me to join him. You know what it means for us. One article was enough to keep our relationship secret, but now... Do you want that? Just tell me. Do you want that? Yes, I do. Good luck. FOUR MONTHS LATER We're going into the home straight. Trust me. LET'S REPAIR POLAND! THE REVIVAL PARTY We want Revival! We want Revival! I must tell you that... When we started our campaign... ...I was scared. I was scared that no one would join us. That we'd be alone. I made a mistake. You helped me get rid of my fear because I saw how many of you wanted a change and good new politics! Today, some politicians want you to be scared all the time. They threaten you with war and terrorism. So, on the final lap of this campaign, I'm asking you to overcome your fear, like I did. Look around at our great achievements! Poland doesn't need an army! Or new fighter planes! Or new rocket launchers! Or weapons for billions of zlotys to get rid of the fear of tomorrow! Because tomorrow depends on our ability to change our country! Revival! Revival! - Would you mind? - Here you go! Thank you for coming. Yes? What was that supposed to mean? 'Poland doesn't need an army.' Huh? - It's OK. We did great. - Always stick to the message, clear? Clear? Clear. Bye. HONEST POLITICS IS POSSIBLE ANNA WAGNER - To be run before the silence. - Like, now? The election's in a week. The Congress is still in the lead. - I'm not interested in politics. - Very funny. It's all we've got on Kostrzewa's financing. Find a lead we can follow. What about Andrzej? What about him? The latest article he wrote was two months ago. Has he been off the wagon again? You vouched for him. So now keep an eye on the man. This is Andrzej Bitner. Leave a message after the tone. Andrzej, where are you? Call me back, will you? A NEW MESSAGE FROM ANONYMOUS OPEN CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ARTICLE Why do we need this camera? For documentation. Do you understand what your job involves? - I know what you guys want. - And it's not a problem for you? I'm OK with everything. Fine. You'll get a job this month. Shall I get into it at once? Janiak will quickly make you an offer. Then you'll go to bed with him. And you'll do whatever he wants, all right? - Sure. And then what? - We'll get in touch with you. Yes? - I saw the video. - What video? Who planted you? You lied to me. - Are you there? - I can't talk about it on the phone. OK. I'll be at your place in thirty minutes. Natalia!
