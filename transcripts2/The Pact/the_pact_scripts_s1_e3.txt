 Woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short. (Rev 12:12) - Are they inside? - Yes. - What is this? - Daniel gave it to the church. - When? - A few months before he died. And you didn't say anything? - Only when I saw Kuba... - I told you about Abraham! - Don't! You can't do it. - Why not? Is there anything else you haven’t told us? What's he shouting?

 'Motherfucker...' 'You deserved it.' I was sure he was shouting at me, blaming me. June 3rd is when Dad died. I got it from Molenda a few weeks later. We have to talk to him. Mum... We need to find the painter. He might know something. Here's a fresh towel. Have some sleep. We'll check it tomorrow. Are you asleep? HOLY WEDNESDAY Please, follow me. Please let me know when you have finished.

 Hi. Did you sleep well? Not really. I searched the fire service registers from the last 15 years. And? There were 19 fires, in which children died but none was him. Maybe it didn't happen in Poland? Anyway, it was never reported. So we’re screwed. Not necessarily. I found something else. That video file. The attributes of the file differ from the metadata of the video stream. And in more understandable terms? Someone falsified its creation date. It was created only a few days ago. It wasn't Daniel. He wasn't the one who sent you this film. Yes, thank you. Goodbye. God bless you. A normal person wouldn't have done such a thing. We'll talk in the evening. I have to go, I'm already late. Will you two manage on your own? What are your plans for today? Young man! None. We don't hire a maid here. Can I go now? - Is the notary in? - He's just left. What are you doing? Please leave! Please leave! I'm leaving. Stop! Stop, will you? - You recognise me? - How can I help you? Daniel Grodecki. A letter from the dead. You recognise me? Certainly. Something's wrong? Who gave it to you? For sure, it wasn't my brother. It happened a few days ago. I don't know what you're talking about. Excuse me, I'm already late. I have a long article on what’s going on here. On letters of authority issued by the deceased, whose properties suddenly change the owner. - The article's ready to be printed. - Yeah? Go ahead and print it. Go and buy Kurier in two days. Grodecki! - What guarantee do I have? - My word for now. - Are you recording this? - You can search me if you want to. I got a call and an order. From an anonymous person. Then I got the package and detailed instructions. And money. Big enough to ignore the details. Who sent the package? Did they leave any trace? If someone wants to remain anynomous, you won't find them. You should know that by now. - What guarantee do I have? - We have nothing on you. So now we're getting into people's beds, right? Not 'people' but a minister. If it's OK with the minister, it's OK with all of us. As the Fourth Estate, we must reveal... Protect. We must protect civil rights. But instead, - we severely infringe them. - Can you leave us alone, please? If he lies as a private person, can we trust his public image? He's the best Minister of Economy - we've had for years. - But he's a liar. - It's not about politics but ethics. - He's going to sue us. - I hope he'll win and then ruin us. - He won't. We have a budget gap. This is Skalski. Rumour has it that things are improving. And this is Bogusz. They are but too slowly. We're short of money as usual. Maybe we have to act differently. 'Outside the box, ' as they say. So you'll finally sack the Minister of Finance. - Who's that? - Nawrot. - You waited too long to do it. - He can't even measure his dick. OK, let's drop this. This oxtail in sauce is exquisite. What is this? We're exposing the minister's soft spot for oxtails? Hold on! Listen to this. The government won't give you such guarantees. - We have to... - It's a huge investment. It's your problem. I can't help you. - You have to! - I don't have to do anything. Sure you don't. But you could. - No way. - Easy. Let me finish. We give money, you become a silent partner. Such a guarantee is good enough for the Chinese. What money are we talking about? If we sign the deal with the Chinese? Let's say this... And then 20 percent of the profit. All right. I'm in. It was 18 months ago. A week later, Bogusz and Nawrot set up a company, Pek-War. Its share capital is half a million zlotys. In the latest quarter, they reported profit of 20 million. - Where did you get this? - I can't. My source... - Where did you get this? - We trust Monika, don't we? - What if it's a fix? Glittered crap? - You've heard the audio. It's a sequel to the tape scandal. Someone illegally bugged the minister. I need to know who and what for. Everything in its right time. Great job, congrats. Modern journalism. You're bloody puppets in someone's hands. Let go just this once, OK? 'DANGEROUS LIAISONS' Don't read this, please. Listen... Good morning. - Today's agenda, sir. - Cancel everything. - Pardon? - Cancel everything. We're going to see the Prime Minister. He was a promising judoka. In fact, he was good at everything. But he screwed it all up. Do you know who this is? Grandma. I’ve heard she killed herself because of you. Is that what your father told you? And you believed in everything. Our relic. Your father stuck it in my belly. Up to this point. He didn’t tell you that, did he? He was your age. Maybe he had his reasons. How did that happen? You don't find it interesting. - Hi. - You can never be on time, can you? It must be somewhere here. Grodecki, Daniel. Here it is. March 5th 2014, Ash Wednesday. - And he just brought it here? - It was hardly a coincidence. - Meaning? - Ash Wednesday is a day of penance. He donated the painting to have a clear conscience. Tadeusz, stop it. He was a good man. - I know what kind of man he was. - You'd know if you hadn't disowned him. He chose his fate on his own. Of course. And it's none of your fault. - Are you coming with me? - You agree with him, don't you? I'll give you a lift. No. Dad. Dad! Come in. That’s all we needed: a sex scandal with a dead man. No one’s a saint but you’re the one who got caught with your dick out. In a fucking hotel? Like a kid. It’s good though they didn’t catch you with some boy. Is there anything else I should know? My attorney will file a lawsuit against Kurier tomorrow. He won't. We’ll try to hush it up. But if the media want to crucify you, I’ll hand them nails. How are the negotiations going? Fine. On Saturday, I’m flying to Oslo to finalise the details. This is the most important issue for us right now, get it? So don’t fuck it up. Darek, from now on, anywhere you go, you show up only with your wife. And her... You’d better never meet her again. Piotrek! - You're late again. - I know, I'm sorry. - You owe me a story. - In a second... No, in a second, you have a conference at the City Hall. About the new parking zones. What's going on? - Everything's fine. - Come on, I'll brief you. Just a moment, hold on. Yes? What's wrong? Fancy a drink? Go on, tell me. I should quit. What bullshit is this? Kowalik and the execs have their own ideas. But Kurier is you, not Kowalik. They need new blood. - People like her. - Cut it out. She’s just brought in a huge scandal. You know Skalski got his palm greased? - Guess by whom. - Bogusz. And Nawrot. And Nawrot... Has Monika talked to him yet? I have no idea. Thanks, man. - Piotrek! - Will be back soon! - What are you doing? - Going with you. - Where? - To see Nawrot. No, no, no way. You owe me something. Besides, it has nothing to do with your story. How's work at the City News? - Awesome. - Is it? Yes. I finally write about issues that really matter to people. Like what? Read my articles and you'll see. It was a great decision. Interesting. Rafał says you're skiving. Please, come in. Oh my, two reporters! Should I be scared? - Hello. - Hello. I have an important meeting in a moment. - Coffee, tea, water? - Don't trouble yourself. How can I help you? Do you mind if I record our conversation? Please, go ahead. - Pek-War. - I'm afraid it's not the best time. My partner is indisposed. That’s why we’re here. The truth is, I have no idea how Pek-War works. I only provided capital. It's one of my many investments. The person who did business with the Chinese was Adrian. - And there is no one else? - Who else? - A third partner? - No. Excuse me. Yes. Start negotiating without me. I'll show up at the end. Yes. - I’m sorry but we have to finish. - Running late? - Thanks for talking to us. - Pity I didn’t satisfy - your curiosity. - On the contrary. Oh, one more thing. Abraham. I’m afraid I don’t understand. - Does it mean anything to you? - Should it? It was Bogusz’s last word. How do you know? What was the link between him and my brother? I don't know. Should there be any? - You knew both of them. - I know lots of people. Whatever you’re implying, I have no idea about it. At the cemetery, after the funeral, I felt you wanted to tell me something. Did you? You’re a good reporter. You’ll manage. - What was that? - None of your business. - I let you come to my interview. - You came here with a preconception. - Bollocks! - You wanted to hear only the things you might find useful. Hi, Piotruś. Coffee? - What are you doing here? - Working, ain't we? Someone made an awful mess here. Who called you here? We'll go to the station to report it? You won't catch him anyway. - What do you know about this? - I don't read tabloids. - But you're interested in this man. - You want to sort it out, ask them. - They got it from you. - I don't reveal my sources. - Even when people die? - Especially then. You're gonna help us, we're gonna help you. You look like you need backup. I don’t want to be rude but I’ve got a flat to tidy up. So, uhm... As you wish. Yes, Ewa? I know who painted the picture. His name is Dec. He has an atelier on the Vistula Scarp. Excuse me, Piotr, I have to go. What's wrong? Why aren't you at Grandpa's? I fucking knew it. You were the reason they fell out. - It doesn't concern you. - Sure it doesn't. Like the fact that Dad stabbed the old man, that he ordered that fucked-up painting or that you banged the two of them! Kuba! Oh, you’re back. Go there, please. - You want to go out like this? - Why not? Take it off. It needs ironing. Come with me. We'd be there together. Will you let me take you out some time? Wait here. A job like any other. He gave me your photo, the money was good. The idea was a little weird but I didn't ask any questions. He told me not to change anything. But the original screwed up the light and shade. The original? It's at the Dominican Church in Kraków. 17th century, by an unknown artist. - And you changed only my face? - Yes. Plus the light and shade. Oh... He also asked me to add this date. Welcome, all of you! Our foundation hands out an annual award to those who develop the market and yet never forget to help others. We always emphasise that they are exceptional people. This year’s winner of the Good-Hearted Businessman Award is someone more than exceptional. We'd like you to see a short film that shows the road our hero had to take to be here with you. Żyrardów. This is where our winner grew up. Do you recognise him? He was already interested in his friends’ money. Vinegar, queues, ration coupons. Food without taste for money without value. This is what our May picnics looked like. In 1989, our hero was taking his high school exams. But it didn’t stop him from working after hours. As far as I know, no inaccuracies were reported. Here, we officially enter the big world. The first taste of freedom. His first company. Obviously with his own capital. They assembled them on their own. Then, they became the main importer of leading brands. Let’s not put it off too long. A symbol of Polish entrepreneurial spirit. An icon of our transformation. A philanthropist with a heart of gold and a good friend of mine. Tomasz Nawrot! Thank you, my dears. It cost you a lot of work, Janusz. I might have recommended you a professional company to do it. I just want to add one remark. Money won’t make you happy. You’re happy only when you spend it. When you spend it to help others. A hard day? I’ve seen better ones. Are you the one I should thank for the article? No, the gossip column is run by the colleague of mine. You would have done that differently. At least, I’d have chosen a better photo of you, sir. This is what hurts the most. The worst thing is that your colleagues don’t even know where to search. May I talk to you for a second, sir? I have nothing to say to you. It's about Pek-War. Sorry? I'd like to give you a chance to comment on the issue before my article goes to press. It’s about your being a silent partner. - What do you mean? - So you deny it? Goodbye. Excuse me. Nice film, the crowd loves you. Yes, I bet they prepared it for my funeral. Have you met anyone interesting? No, but anyway, thanks for the invitation. What invitation? Mr Grodecki? Can I see your invitation, please? And you are...? The head of security. Can I see your invitation, please? Sorry? You’re not welcome here. Leave this place. Get it? Who sent you? Don’t fucking butt in. May I have your attention, please? You’re probably wondering what I’m doing here and who invited me. I’d like to know it myself. All of you who gathered here are people of success. All of you are wealthy. And it's a problem. What to do with so much money? What do you have to sacrifice to get it? How far can you go? Where’s the boundary you can’t cross? Abraham. God told him to sacrifice his son. That is a lot, right? But that deal, did it bring Abraham any profits? It sure brought him substantial profits. For his blind obedience, God promised to make him the king of the vast land. What promise was made to you? What prom... What's wrong? I'll go on my own. Stop pushing me. Thanks. Hello? Who’s that? Are you here? What? What conspiracy? Tell me the fucking truth or I’ll return and say the rest. Konary? What happened there 25 years ago? - What is it? - Need to see the video of the exit. - It's very important! - Get out of here! Please, help me!
