 In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see. (Isa 29:28) - Did you know him? - No. - How about Daniel? - Maybe. I don't know. Abraham. What's this all about? Why did Daniel want us to see that? No idea. Take care. I can't stand thinking about it all the time. Why did he do it to us?

 I'll talk to him if you want. No, thanks. - You dating him. - No. - Let me... - That prick's to blame for Dad's death. - You don't understand anything. - No, I bloody don't. I've had an awful day... At the cinema or café? Thank you. Good night. May I come in? I need your help to open this. Insert it into a narrow port. I really need to have it opened.

 Long time no see. I don't do it anymore. It's very important to me. - It's from Daniel. - I've told you I don't do it. So you won't help me? I'm sorry. Thanks. ...a fan of car racing. It was his regular practice route. Today, he died after being involved in a car accident and explosion. Criminal forensic experts try to find out why he lost control of his car. - Let's talk. - Did a manhole in the centre give way? - What is it? - It was no accident. Bogusz often practised in that area. Someone knew he'd do it. - It must have been planned. - What do you mean? It involves Daniel too. We've been in court for months and may end up jobless. - So don't push it. - Put me on this story. - You won't regret it. - No. - You wanted me back! - But not on Daniel's story. I'm no longer in charge here after what happened. The evidence Monika has against Bogusz is bullshit someone sends her. Someone knew he'd crash. It was set up a long time ago. How come you know that? I'd better be here for a reason. Ladies and gentlemen... - Piotr has new information... - About? Bogusz. It was no accident. Someone made him kill himself. Who? It was carefully planned a long time ago. - Evidence? - I have it. What kind of evidence? - They must have harassed him. - You writing it down? His exact words. 'Harassed, ' 'killed himself.' Add: 'suicide' and 'Grodecki.' Any of these words is printed and you can look for a new job. - You don't fucking let me... - You know the sales results? They dropped by nine percent in the last quarter. We're still in court for harassing your brother. - You want to ruin us? - But... Remember this: Bogusz died in an accident. So print an obituary. But you can gain more on what I have for you. What the fuck is that? Another conspiracy theory? Start a blog then. Who gave you the tip on Bogusz? My sources. Sources you contacted only online? I check my informers. Unlike you. - Who are they? - People from his company! Are they? I checked them. - None of them was Sara. - Shut up. The last year repeats itself. - He killed himself because of you? - Shut the fuck up! Enough! To sum up: Bogusz died in an accident. Piotr can write the article based on rational arguments. - Then we'll decide. - You won't. - Pardon? - You won't run it anyway. Hi, can we meet today? Tomorrow will be too late. Neither at my work nor at yours. Fine. Pull up, please. We shouldn't meet for now. So you're leaving me alone with all this. No. - It will be better this way. - For whom? For us. Really. How long? A few weeks. And then someone will call you. - What am I to do? - Nothing. No interviews. All right? Not a word to reporters. We both have too much to lose now. You're the one to set rules here. - Why? - It's just my whim. Your people won't take it? Is it some dodgy deal? Would it be a problem for your paper? None. - I'll share the linage with you. - No. You sure? If Kurier finds out, you'll need every penny. I'm dead anyway. FAKE LOANS OF BOGUSZ FINANCIAL DIRECTOR TOP SUSPECT HOLY TUESDAY KURIER KILLS! KURIER KILLS! Motherfucker. He's out. - What makes you so sure it was him? - Stop being so idealistic. He sold us and will pay for that. So our next cover is a silly affair. - But why exactly? - To divert people from this rubbish. Her affair killed him, not us. - So we'll ignore the truth. - We can't ignore the sales. - And jelly wrestling will help us? - Good. You're a fast learner. Doubts? We should go to the hotel and find out who needed Skalski's pics. What for? We have a story ready to run. OK, go there. Be ready by six. I'm the one to arrange it. - She doesn't report to you. - She's in my section. But all the sections are mine. - Yes? - Piotr Grodecki, Kurier. Can we talk? I've got nothing to tell you. You want money. No. I want to talk about your husband's death. The police forbade me to discuss it. They never say so. But I do. Please, leave. I was there. Sorry? I saw his accident. I have to know why your husband is dead. Just like you said: it was simply an accident. - You remember Daniel Grodecki? - What's the link? He was my brother. For a long time, Adrian... I don't know how to put it. - I guess he was scared. - Of what? Please, follow me. Here. We were planning to flee abroad. Our son attends a school abroad. Adrian had it all arranged. - Interesting. - We had a casual relatonship. My husband had a lot of affairs but no reason to kill himself. Not now. Who's Abraham? - Sorry? - Did Adrian ever mention him? I've never heard of him. Thanks. I'll let myself out. I can't find any sugar. I don't mind it bitter. I'm sorry. - What's up at work? - Fine. Boring stuff, as usual. Your substitute annoys everyone, so... It's time you stopped treating him as my substitute. But he's terrible. Don't do this to us. How are you feeling? It depends. - I apologize. - No, I should have listened to you. While I should have been braver. More determined. Excuse me. They won't let me finish this awful coffee. It's going to be fine. All you need is peace and normal social life. Just promise me one thing. What is it? Don't get involved in anything. Not now. Please. All right. Bye. This ruin's being handled at last. Janusz Derenda. We all deserve a better view. Shall we go to my office? What am I supposed to do with this? The photos were taken in your hotel. It's up to you what angle we'll take when writing the article. - It's her. - I guess so. We've got the day. Skalski will show up soon. Here he comes. Pause it. The maid? Don't think so. What was that? Seven minutes are missing. Check other cameras on this floor. Still missing. The lift. - At 9:16. - It's there. What was that? A sequel to the tapping scandal? - Who told you to do it? - Nobody. - A hobby of yours? - Yeah. - Only here? - Other places too. I like to know things. - The police like to know you too. - We're not on first-name terms. Let's talk like adults, or I'm calling the police. Fine. These photos, it's nothing. If you want a real scandal, I'll give you one. And? Something stinks. I'll have more info tomorrow. But today we're closing the story. I made a promise we wouldn't mention the hotel owner. He didn't protect his guests' privacy and you promised him anonymity? - It's not... - The guy's guilty. - We both know... - Someone watches hotel guests. And the Minister has links to the world of business. It's significant information. You know what to do. Are they from a supermarket too? I told you not to do the shopping in big stores. Protein hydrolyzate... - What are you looking for? - The story of Abraham. The Book of Genesis, chapter 22. "Some time later God tested Abraham. "He said... 'Take your son, your only son, whom you love - Isaac. "Sacrifice him as a burnt offering on a mountain I will show you.' "Abraham bound his son Isaac and laid him on the altar. "Then he reached out his hand "and took the knife to slay his son." - What do you need it for? - Work. Yes? Right. Where? I'll be there. Thank you. Have to go. See you soon. - Hello. - Sorry to bother you. You were to tell me something important. It's about Weronika. She's ill. She needs peace and quiet. Meaning? Her mental state is rather poor. Didn't you notice? Is this why she doesn't go out? She needs peace. Doctor's orders. And yours. You're keeping her isolated. No. Don't drag her into this. Drag her into what? She feels much better now. I'm asking you for her good. We're very close. Is that all? - Yes. - Thank you. Get the fuck out of here! - Tell him to get out. - Calm down. What the fuck is this? We need to talk. - Take only necessities. Hurry up. - I won't go with him. - Piotr's helping us. - No one asked him to. - Someone did. - Who? - Your dad. - On the day he died. - You're lying. - I'd like to. Come on. - Hi. - Sorry it's so urgent and late. Come inside. Piotr, what's going on? They can't stay at home for now. - Something's wrong? - No, don't worry. You know Ewa. This is Kuba. Good evening. I'm Tadeusz Grodecki, your grandpa. - Which room was my dad's? - That one. Wait! I apologise. NEW MESSAGE FROM WER0101 COME HERE ASAP. - WHAT'S WRONG? - JUST COME. CALLING YOU. DON'T. - Get up. - What is it? - Get dressed. - What is it? We're going out. Let's go. - What's going on? - Let's go. What's wrong? Dad! Dad! Dad!
