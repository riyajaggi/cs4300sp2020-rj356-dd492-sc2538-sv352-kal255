 Moses then took the blood, sprinkled it on the people and said, 'This is the blood of the covenant that the Lord has made with you in accordance with all these words.' (Ex 24:8) Told you to stay the fuck out of this. I'd like to report assault and battery. Um... The corner of Św. Barbara and Poznańska. Please, hurry up. No, we won’t do it. Too little evidence. - Andrzej, the press is waiting. - We have a problem then. I brought the audio, the material is strong. It all adds up! - So who's behind it? - It's not our job to...

 Then fucking what is it? So what is our job, Monika? You've gone nuts! - Have you been drinking? - What’s it got to do with anything? What’s going on? Andrzej won't publish the transcript. - Why not? - 'Cos it's fake! He thinks we should check it again. - It's a newspaper's duty to... - Stop bullshitting! If this story runs tomorrow, I’ll quit. Call the press. Tell them to start the machines. Monika, write the Editor’s Note. Get down to work, now! Thank you.

 I need to keep you here for observation. I have no time, Doctor. - Here you are. - What's this? Two fractured ribs. Plus suspected concussion and an overall body trauma. What can I do? Pressure of work. - Do you feel sick? - Yes. - So you really should stay. - Need to take this. Hi. He wasn’t supposed to fucking go out! All right, I’m sorry. I’ll handle it. I’ll call you back. I have to go. - Take the X-rays. - No need to, thank you. - And? - Kuba's gone missing. - What? - Kuba's missing. Hospital, yes. As fast as you can. Something’s wrong? Get in. We’ll wait, thanks. - We might have a chat at last. - What about? Your speech at the Warsaw Business Club. How the fuck do you know about it? - Get in. - No, thanks. It's your ma. No, I won’t tell you. I'm OK. Stop calling me, get it? - He's out of range. - The signal's gone. Hi. That's good. Did he say where he was? Ewa, calm down. Give him some time. I'm sure he'll be back. Please, calm down. We'll be in touch. Bye. The kid picked up but didn't say where he was. Look what I found. The car is registered to Grzegorz Merta. - Address? - Cisowa 16. - A businessman? - He owns several companies. Number 96 on a list of richest Poles. - When was he born? - 1971. - One year younger than Daniel. - His university friend? Where did he study? The Kraków Academy of Economics. Daniel studied in Warsaw. Check 'Konary.' It's a business centre near Kraków. What did they do there 25 years ago? The earliest documents on their server come from 1994. Earlier, they must have kept analogue archives. We have to go there as fast as we can. Let's stick to Merta. He's our link. I will go. - No, love. - I'll manage. MAUNDY THURSDAY Piotr, Kuba's here. He's going to Kraków. OK, I'll let you know. Bye. Thanks. KURIER KNOWS NO SACRED COWS This is exactly what I expect. It’s still all over the news. Our citation index will surely leap. We've broken all records for clickability. It's possible, see? Great job, Monika. We need more stories like this one. What about Andrzej? Andrzej made up his mind yesterday. And I respect it. Today, Jurek will take over his duties. Any questions? Thank you. Perhaps we might try with Andrzej... No, Monika. Unless he apologizes to me, there’s no way he’s back. - Hi. - Hi. What's up? - I feel stupid. - Come on. You just believed in the Editor who doesn't give a shit about us. It's not like this. He has some arguments. Everyone does. - It's pointless. Go talk to him. - No. And you'd better be careful. In this job, you lose your face only once. Good morning. The Prime Minister is waiting for you. You’re here. Take a seat, please. I'll finish in a second. This thing with Kurier, what’s it about? Nothing, it’s nonsense. And the audio? Look, they edited some parts out. True, they wanted something from me but I told them to get lost. It’s not what I read. Like I said, they edited the audio. - Who did? - I don't know. It may concern the energy pact. But who wants to break off the negotiations? I got a call from the chairman of the People's Party. What do they want? Your job. Now. They’ll stay in the coalition on condition that you resign. What a joke! - Because of such nonsense? - Doesn't matter why. So? We can't break up the coalition now. You want me to quit, don’t you? Let's say, you might resign for personal reasons. Personal reasons. - Fine, what about the negotiations? - Someone will substitute for you. It’s already the final phase. Give me one day, please. I’ll finish things at the office and say goodbye to my staff. Then, I’ll call a press conference. OK. Listen... You know how important this coalition is. Especially now. Of course. Ticket, please. (GREETINGS: HAPPY EASTER:) - May I see your ticket, please? - I don't have it. So what shall we do? Excuse me. I'm with him. I'll pay for the ticket. He’s really worried about you. What are your plans now? My plans are my business. We learnt something about your father. Near Kraków, in Konary, there’s a training centre. There, he may have met Bogusz. It's possible everything started then. I thought you could go there with me. We'd check it together but since you already have plans... Wait. I’m going to Kraków to visit the Dominican Church. There’s the original painting that my father used as a model. Daddy! I've made an Easter egg, look! It's beautiful. - Shall I get the door? - No, I'll take care of this. - What do you want? - Why did Daniel kill himself? - No idea what you mean. - Don't piss me off. Daddy, come on. Dad will be there in a sec. Go join the kids! Come in. What do you want? Why did my brother have to die? - I don't know. - You're lying. I'm not. You sent me the video. - What is it all about? - I can't. Not here. - I'll report it to the police. - I'll tell you. But not here. My children's life is at stake. Place? With lots of people around. It’s not safe here. Rotunda at nine. You don't show up, I go to the police. Yes? No, not now. Maybe tomorrow. What? What do you mean fired? Yes? Who? Let him in. I usually make my appointments through the secretariat. But it was impossible today, considering the circumstances. - Circumstances? - Your dismissal. So everyone already knows, don't they? That’s the point. I don't understand. - My clients want to be the first. - Could you be clearer, please? I have an attractive job offer for you. - Beg your pardon? - In the private sector. Certainly, the same field of expertise. Such a renowned expert as you will soon receive many offers. But we wanted to be the first. And it will be hard to outbid us. - I need time to think it over. - Certainly. One day. Is that all? Here’s my number. Goodbye. Thank you. Out of all days... What bad luck. Excuse me. Good afternoon. We’re here about the IT infrasctructure failure. Oh, that’s great! I opened an email with Easter greetings. And all the computers went down at once. It’s a particularly mean virus. We’ll have to delete it from every unit separately. Oh dear... How many workstations are in your company? This one, two at each of the offices. One in the reading room and the archive. Why don’t we start with the archive? Wait, I've got something. A seminary for students. ‘Leaders of the New Millennium 1992.’ - What about a list of participants? - Not here. Hold on. What are you doing? I’ve got the name of the coordinator. Strojnowski. Lech Strojnowski. Tomorrow as usual, a quarter past? Don't drive in. Let's meet. - What a prick. - Andrzej didn't give him any choice. It can be called off. Just talk to Andrzej. He’s an independent, expert reporter and not a fucking media worker. You’re the only person who can persuade him. Is this all you’ve got? For now, yes. Andrzej's right. You're puppets in someone's hands. It's a setup, all right. - Thanks for your help. - Hold on... I’ll talk to him, that’s obvious. Tell me... What business did Bogusz do with Merta? None. They were just best friends. Friends... They went skiing in St Moritz and diving in the Maldives, you know. Let me know how it went, will you? I will. Bye. Hi, Andrzej. I’ve heard you have an evening off. Call me back. Let's go, Kuba. Good afternoon. - Oh, good afternoon. - How can I help you? We’re here to see Professor Strojnowski. But professor’s not here. He’s in Kraków, at the Dominican Church. I thought we were not supposed to meet. I shouldn’t have left you alone with this. I’ll manage. You owe me nothing. I’m sorry. I want to be with you. When? - When the scandal is all over? - No. Now. And you’re sure this is the best moment? When will the moment be right? Bye. - Professor! Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. My name’s Kuba Grodecki. I’m Daniel Grodecki’s son. Can I ask you a few questions? Our aim was very simple. Let's gather the best economy students from around Poland in one place. Later on, they were supposed to change our country. An exceptional generation. They took their finals in a Communist state. But they started university in free Poland. Our enthusiasm was enormous. Enormous! We truly believed that they would be the ones to build a new market here. Konary was going to be only the beginning. This is where we met afterwards. - Afterwards? - Yes. After the course finished, some students, including your father, asked me to continue our seminary. And what did you teach them? - How to achieve success? - Of course. Most importantly, they were to leave this place equipped with certain principles. What principles? It may sound funny. Justice... Honesty... It was my best group. - Is this Grzegorz Merta? - Uh-huh. I never believed that your father was a swindler. Daniel was too smart to get involved in such a silly thing. And this one, with his head turned, who is he? Oh, this is our child prodigy. I’m sure you know him: Tomasz Nawrot. Would you like to comment on today’s article in Kurier? Kurier? I haven’t read it yet. Did you contact Minister Skalski? Sure. He’s a very nice man. - So you did offer him a bribe? - No, I didn't say that. What did your collaboration involve? I’ll keep you in suspense for a while. - Any further comments? - Everything will clear up soon. Thank you, goodbye. Going anywhere? - Told you, not here and not now. - How did you know about Bogusz? Tell me or I’m calling the police. Don't. We were in this together, Adrian too. We meaning who? You? Daniel? Tell me the fucking truth! All right, I’m gonna make this call. - It’s much bigger than you think. - What is? - Big money. - How big is big? Huge. - The money for which you can kill. - Even children? It was a tragedy, an accident. No one had suspected it was for real. What was? - The Pact. - What fucking Pact? Go now, will you? Leave me alone. - Who killed that child? - The thing is... Nobody wants to sacrifice their own kids but it's the best guarantee of loyalty. - Whose idea was that? - Go now! - I'm sorry I gave it to you. - Just say it. - You can't do anything. - Fuck! Tell me! Tell me! - Here’s my train. - What? Good afternoon, everyone. Minister Skalski will make a short statement. He will not, however, answer any questions at the moment. Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. For the last few days, I’ve experienced attacks targeted at both my personal life and professional career. I’m not going to explain personal matters to you. Yet, as for my professional activities, I want to make it clear that I have never accepted any financial benefits from Mr Bogusz or Mr Nawrot. Let me say this again: never. Despite that, I've been asked today to resign. In a democratic society, it is common practice to step back from politics until things are clarified. It is good practice. But I'm not going to do this. I'm not going to resign. Kurier published the transcript of a fabricated recording. I'm innocent. I won’t let rumour and manipulation control our politics. I won't let it happen. - Any questions? - What did the PM say - to your decision? - You're the first to know. Who might want to release the fabricated audio? This is a question for you, not me. Before you published the transcript you must have realized what aim someone tried to achieve by using you as a tool, is that right? Thank you. Minister! Sir! You got anything? - Kuba... - It's OK. Actually, I’m not really sure what I hoped for. I wish I’d been a regular here like you. Something happened? What is it? There's been another suicide. - Who? - Grzegorz Merta. I saw him fucking jump in front of the train. It's no coincidence. Daniel, Bogusz, Merta. They got into a sick deal. The guarantee was the life of their kids. - You fucking get it? - Just listen to yourself... Even Nawrot is in this. We found their location. It’s been going on for years. - Drop it. - What? Drop it before it's too late. If what you’re saying is true and someone’s powerful enough to force those guys to do such things maybe this time it isn’t worth it? What is it all about? MISSING: FIVE-YEAR-OLD AND HIS FATHER. ABDUCTION? - Yes? - Listen... One of the participants of Konary workshops a friend of Daniel's, went missing with his son two years ago. - I found a photo. It's the boy. - From the video? They both went missing on July 20th, 2013. Hold on. July 20th is the date in the painting with Kuba. Hold on. Wait a sec. Kuba! Can you hear me? Kuba! Hello? - What is it again? - You’re under arrest. It's in connection with deaths of Grzegorz Merta and Adrian Bogusz. You have the right to an attorney.
