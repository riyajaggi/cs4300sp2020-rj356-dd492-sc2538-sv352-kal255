 OH, MY GOD. [ DOOR CREAKS ] Bruni: I'M AMY BRUNI. I WAS ONLY 8 WHEN A PARANORMAL INCIDENT CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER. [ GIRL LAUGHS ] SINCE THEN, I'VE DEDICATED MY TIME TO SOLVING THE MOST TERRIFYING HAUNTINGS IMAGINABLE. Berry: I'M ADAM BERRY. MORE THAN A DECADE AGO, AN ENCOUNTER AT GETTYSBURG ROCKED MY BELIEFS ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL. Bruni: TOGETHER, WE UNCOVER THE TRUTH - BEHIND THE UNEXPLAINABLE. - OH. OH, MY GOD.

 NOW, WE ARE ON OUR MOST IMPORTANT MISSION YET. ♪♪ HELPING FAMILIES OVERCOME THEIR FEAR, TAKE BACK THEIR HOMES, AND RECLAIM THEIR LIVES. BRUNI: Hey, Adam. I just got a case in Foxborough, Massachusetts, and we need to get out there right now. ♪♪ The homeowners, Holly and Tom, claim they've had activity for quite a while. Even more strange, the clients' neighbor reports seeing activity going on in their house from across the street. But most importantly, the reason Tom and Holly called is their kids. Something happened in their bedroom and it totally freaked them out. The activity is increasing. The family doesn't know what to do and they're terrified. We need to get out there and help them. ♪♪ Bruni: HERE WE ARE. THIS IS IT. TELL US. WHAT IS GOING ON AROUND HERE? WE'VE HAD A LOT OF ACTION THROUGHOUT ALL THE YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN HERE. YEAH. SO, LITTLE BITS AT A TIME. SO, WE'VE BEEN HERE SINCE 1999. Bruni: SO, WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS ROOM? SITTING IN THE LIVING ROOM, WATCHING TV, YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING. BUT IT'S MORE DOWN THE HALL. AND EVERYONE IN THE FAMILY SEES IT, HAS SEEN IT. I'VE SEEN IT, HOLLY HAS SEEN IT, AND MEGHAN HAS SEEN IT. - AND MEGHAN IS YOUR DAUGHTER? - YES. - YES. - OKAY. SO, DOWN HERE IS WHERE WE SEE A SHADOW GOING, YOU KNOW... - COMING THIS WAY? - YES. HOW TALL, YOU THINK? PROBABLY YOUR HEIGHT. IS THERE ANY SOUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT... - NO. - ...LIKE FOOTSTEPS? HOW OFTEN DO YOU SEE THE SHADOW? ME, PERSONALLY, I'VE ONLY SEEN IT ONCE OR TWICE. - OKAY. - BUT WE SWITCHED MY KIDS' ROOMS, AND THAT'S WHEN EVERYTHING WAS CRAZY. SO, ONCE YOU STARTED MOVING ITEMS AROUND THE ROOMS, ACTIVITY STARTED PEAKING. - EXACTLY. - OKAY. OKAY. MY NEIGHBOR ACROSS THE STREET, CINDY, SEES A SHADOW FIGURE IN THIS WINDOW HERE, IN JUST THIS WINDOW. - OKAY. SO, SHE'S SEEN THE FIGURE, AND THE PLANT HASN'T BEEN HERE. - CORRECT. - OKAY. Berry: WHATEVER'S HERE SEEMS TO ROAM THE WHOLE MAIN FLOOR OF THE HOUSE. IT DOESN'T SEEM SHY AROUND THE FAMILY. Bruni: SO, WHAT IS THIS ROOM? Tom: THIS IS A DEN AND MY WORKOUT ROOM. - RIGHT. - OKAY. SO, WHEN I'M DOWN HERE, I FEEL THAT, LIKE, "SOMEBODY IS WATCHING ME" TYPE OF THING. SO, I'M ALWAYS LOOKING IN THIS DIRECTION. I FEEL LIKE IT'S COMING FROM HERE, IN THIS ROOM, OR DOWN THAT HALL IN THE BACK THERE. SO -- AND THERE'S NOTHING EVER THERE, AND I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING. I JUST FEEL IT. YOU KNOW, I GET THAT WEIRD FEELING. AND THEN, WHAT ELSE DOWN HERE? MY SON MATTHEW'S ROOM IS RIGHT THERE. SO, MY DAUGHTER, MEGHAN, AND MATTHEW ARE PLAYING A GAME SITTING ON THE BED, AND THEY HEARD SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING COME IN AND THEN WHISPER, "HELLO." AND THEY BOTH HEARD IT. - IN THERE? - IN THERE, AT THE SAME TIME, AND THEY TOOK OFF UPSTAIRS. THIS IS MATTHEW'S ROOM. SO, THIS IS MATTHEW'S ROOM. YES. - OKAY. - SO, AT THAT TIME, WHEN THAT HAPPENED, THE BED WAS ON THIS WALL. AND SO, THERE WAS NOBODY OUTSIDE ON THE PORCH OR ANYTHING? NOT THAT WE KNOW OF, NOTHING. - OKAY. - FOR SURE. Berry: WHO DO YOU THINK IS IN THE HOUSE? I THINK IT COULD BE ONE OF MY PARENTS. REALLY? OKAY. 'CAUSE THEY BOTH PASSED RIGHT AFTER. OH, RIGHT AFTER YOU MOVED IN HERE? - YES. - OKAY. SO, MY MOTHER ESPECIALLY, MY FATHER NOT SO MUCH. BUT SHE PASSED IN 2000. Bruni: HAS ANY OF THE ACTIVITY THAT YOU'VE ENCOUNTERED IN THE HOUSE MADE YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE YOUR MOM? MY MOTHER AND I HAD A FALLING OUT BEFORE SHE PASSED. OKAY. SO, I'M WONDERING IF IT'S MY MOTHER. - OKAY. - I'M NOT QUITE SURE. NORMALLY, ADAM AND I WOULDN'T SUSPECT A FAMILY MEMBER TO SCARE THEIR OWN RELATIVE. BUT IF THERE'S BAD BLOOD, THE ACTIVITY COULD BE HOLLY'S MOTHER REACHING OUT TO RESOLVE THINGS. MY MOTHER WAS ROSALYN. THAT GIVES US SOMETHING TO GO ON TONIGHT, SO WE CAN TRY TO REACH OUT TO THEM, TOO, AS WE INVESTIGATE. RIGHT. I WOULD LOVE TO JUST KNOW WHO IT IS AND IF THEY'RE OKAY WITH US. ♪♪ EVERYONE IN THIS FAMILY HAS SEEN THE SHADOW FIGURE, BUT LATELY, THE ACTIVITY HAS SPIKED, AND TOM AND HOLLY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE VOICE THE KIDS HEARD. WE'RE SITTING THEM DOWN SEPARATELY AND GETTING THEIR SIDES OF THE STORY. Berry: THANKS FOR MEETING WITH ME TODAY, MATTHEW. NO PROBLEM. TELL ABOUT THAT EXPERIENCE WHEN YOU GUYS HEARD A VOICE. TAKE ME THROUGH THAT WHOLE THING. SO, IT WAS A LITTLE WHILE AGO. ME AND MY SISTER WERE DOWNSTAIRS IN MY BEDROOM. WE WERE PLAYING A GAME, SITTING ON THE BED. WE HEARD SOMETHING AT THE SAME TIME. OKAY. WE HEARD A "HELLO," BUT WE JUST THOUGHT IT WAS MY MOTHER, AND WE JUST KEPT GOING WITH THE GAME, AND WE JUST KEPT PLAYING. AND THEN, LIKE, 30 SECONDS LATER PROBABLY, WE HEARD IT REALLY LOUD. IT WAS IN MY RIGHT EAR. OKAY. SO, WE JUST BOLTED AND RAN UPSTAIRS. Matthew: A BUNCH OF STUFF WENT THROUGH MY MIND, "WHAT WAS IT? DID I ACTUALLY HEAR IT? WAS IT A GHOST? WAS IT..." -- STUFF LIKE THAT. SO... - OKAY. Meghan: I JUST DON'T EVEN LIKE GOING DOWN THERE. IT'S REALLY SCARY, AND IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE BEING WATCHED, LIKE, 24/7. WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING UP THE STAIRS, YOU JUST KIND OF BOLT UP 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO LOOK BEHIND YOU AND STUFF. RIGHT. AND, I MEAN, DO YOU FEEL SAFE? IT JUST ALWAYS FEELS LIKE EVERYWHERE IN THE HOUSE YOU'RE BEING WATCHED. IT JUST ALWAYS FEELS LIKE YOU'RE BEING WATCHED BY SOMETHING. AND IF I'M JUST LOOKING, WATCHING TV, I JUST SEE THIS TALL, DARK, JUST SHADOW JUST, LIKE, STANDING THERE HALFWAY IN BETWEEN THE ENTRYWAY AND THE LIVING ROOM. SO, IT'S ACTUALLY JUST STANDING THERE WHEN YOU SEE IT? YEAH. IT'S NOT MOVING. IT WAS A MALE, TOO. IT WAS, LIKE, A MALE BODY SHAPE. OKAY. SO, YOU COULD SEE IT LOOKS LIKE A MAN. BUT YOU HEARD A FEMALE VOICE DOWNSTAIRS. YEAH. IT'S INTERESTING THAT SHE SEES A MALE, BUT SHE HEARD A FEMALE VOICE. IT MAKES ME WONDER IF WE'RE DEALING WITH MULTIPLE ENTITIES. AND HOW OFTEN DOES IT HAPPEN? PROBABLY THREE TIMES A WEEK. IT HAPPENS REALLY OFTEN. REALLY? ♪♪ MEGHAN SEES THIS DARK, LOOMING SHADOW ALL THE TIME, AND SHE'S CONSTANTLY, LIKE, ASKING HER FAMILY, "DO YOU SEE IT? DO YOU SEE IT? DO YOU SEE IT?" I MEAN, NO ONE WANTS TO LOOK OVER AND SEE THIS DARK SHADOW MAN STANDING IN THE HALLWAY STARING AT THEM. THAT MAKES THE FAMILY ROOM, WHERE SHE SAYS SHE'S BEING WATCHED, OUR FIRST PRIORITY. ♪♪ WE'RE USING THE DVR CAMERAS TO TRY TO PICK UP ON THIS DARK FIGURE SHE SEES SO OFTEN. - SO, AMY... - YES? Berry:...I'M GONNA PUT THIS CAMERA HERE... - LET ME SEE. - ...SO THAT WE GET -- 'CAUSE THEY'RE SITTING HERE, RIGHT, AND THEY SEE THAT SHADOW DOWN THERE? - YEAH. - COOL. ♪♪ SO, THEY SIT HERE. SO, THESE ARE USUALLY CLOSED, HE SAID, AND THOSE ARE USUALLY CLOSED. DO YOU WANT TO SHUT THEM? BECAUSE, I MEAN, WE AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME, MAYBE, IT'S A CAR. YEAH. CARS GO THIS WAY. SO, THE HEADLIGHTS WOULD GO THIS WAY BECAUSE THEY POINT -- THE HEADLIGHTS, FOR A SECOND, POINT AT THIS HOUSE THIS WAY. YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T CAST ANY LIGHT TO THE BACK OF THAT HALLWAY. OKAY. HOLD ON. IT WOULD BE DARK. IT WOULD BE PITCH DARK DOWN THERE, AND THEY'RE, LIKE, SITTING HERE LIKE THIS. WATCHING TV. MY PERIPHERAL, LIKE, I DEFINITELY SEE THAT SITTING HERE, LOOKING AT THE TV. I DEFINITELY SEE THAT WHOLE AREA. SO, WHATEVER IT IS HAS GOT TO BE... - BIG. - YEAH. HELLO. WHOEVER IS IN THIS HOUSE... ...YOU CAN COME JOIN US IN THIS AREA. MY NAME'S AMY. I'M ADAM. HOLLY AND TOM INVITED US INTO THE HOME TO TALK TO YOU. THEY KNOW THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH YOU, SO THEY ASKED US TO COME HERE. UM, DID YOU SEE THAT? ♪♪ UM, DID YOU SEE THAT? ♪♪ RIGHT THERE ON THE DOORFRAME -- THE DOOR, LIKE, INTO THE MASTER BEDROOM. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU. ♪♪ I MEAN, I WOULD DEFINITELY SEE THAT. DO IT AGAIN. YEAH. I MEAN, IT'S FAST, BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY SEE IT. I WALKED INTO THAT MASTER BEDROOM, AND I FELT LIKE I WAS BEING WATCHED. - REALLY? -100%. I WALKED IN THERE, AND I WAS LIKE, "THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE IN THIS ROOM." SHOULD WE MOVE INTO THERE? DO YOU FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S IN THERE? WE NEED TO GO IN THAT ROOM. ♪♪ WHOEVER IS HERE, THERE'S A GREEN LIGHT ON THE END OF THE BED HERE, OKAY? YOU MAY BE ABLE TO REACH OUT, GRAB ONTO THAT, AND THAT GREEN LIGHT WILL GO FROM GREEN TO YELLOW TO RED. THEY SAY THAT, SOMETIMES, WHEN THEY MOVE THINGS AROUND YOU GET A LITTLE AGITATED. DOES IT BOTHER YOU? IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT DONE TO THE HOUSE THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE YET? LET'S LISTEN TO THIS. [ UHNEXPLAINED STATIC NOISE ] THAT'S SOMETHING. [ UNEXPLAINED STATIC NOISE ] "IT DOES"? I MEAN, IT'S TWO SYLLABLES. IT DOES. IT SOUNDED LIKE, "IT DOES." YEAH. THAT'S WHAT I FIRST THOUGHT. - IT DOES. - IT DOES. IT DOES BOTHER THEM. LET'S ASK SOME MORE QUESTIONS. HAVE YOU BEEN TRYING TO TALK TO HOLLY AND THE KIDS? THEY SAID THEY HEARD YOU SAY, "HELLO." DO YOU REMEMBER SAYING THAT TO THEM? THEY'RE NOT TALKING ANYMORE. WHOEVER IT IS SAID IT DOES BOTHER THEM. BUT, LIKE, ANYONE CAN SAY THAT. YEAH. WE NEED TO FIND OUT IF IT'S CONNECTED TO THIS HOUSE OR THE FAMILY. ♪♪ Bruni: SOMETHING'S COMMUNICATING, BUT THE "IT DOES" EVP ISN'T HELPING US FIGURE OUT WHO. I NEED TO ASK MORE ABOUT HER MOM AND THE PREVIOUS HOMEOWNERS. NOW, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE HOUSE WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT, ANYTHING WITH THE FORMER HOMEOWNERS? WELL, THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING THAT'S DOWNSTAIRS. CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THAT? THERE'S A BOARD IN THE BASEMENT THAT WAS LEFT HERE BY THE PREVIOUS HOMEOWNERS. IT'S A COLLAGE OF THEIR PERSONAL PICTURES AND NOTES AND OTHER STUFF THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S RELATED TO THEIR LIFE TOGETHER. OKAY. YEAH. WELL, WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT, FOR SURE. SO, WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP LIKE WITH YOUR MOM? IT WAS ESTRANGED. SHE LEFT THE DAY I TURNED 18. - REALLY? - I THINK THAT WAS HER PLAN. DID YOU HAVE ANY INKLING SHE WAS GOING TO DO THAT? NO. AND WAS YOUR MOM A LOVING MOM? NO. - NO? - NO. - MNH-MNH? - MNH-MNH. AND SHE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT IN HER 50S... [ GASPS ] ...AND SO, WE NEVER GOT TO REALLY SETTLE WHAT WE HAD. OKAY. IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED TO SAY TO YOUR MOM, WHAT WOULD IT BE? YOU KNOW, I FEEL THAT SHE COULD HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME, AND THE WEIRD THING WAS, I WAS READY TO FORGIVE BECAUSE I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY SON. AND I WAS GOING TO REACH OUT TO HER AT CHRISTMAS, BUT IT WAS DECEMBER 2ND WHEN SHE PASSED. MM. SO, IF I WERE TO SAY ANYTHING, I WOULD SAY TO HER, YOU KNOW, "I FORGIVE." SO, I'M HOPING THAT SHE KNOWS THAT. YOU ARE A STRONG WOMAN. - YEAH. I THINK SO. - YOU KNOW? YEAH. THAT'S A LOT. - I DO. I GAVE HER THE RIGHT, PROPER FUNERAL. I DID THE RIGHT THING. WHEN I WENT TO HER APARTMENT, THERE'S A FEW ITEMS THAT I TOOK, AND I CAN'T MOVE THEM. SO, YOU CAN'T MOVE THEM. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IF I DO, THEN, I FEEL ACTIVITY. REALLY? WHAT IS IT? IT'S JUST, LIKE, A LITTLE DIAMOND PYRAMID. OKAY. ♪♪ WE'VE FOUND MANY TIMES DURING CASES LIKE THIS, PEOPLE DON'T HAVE GREAT RELATIONSHIPS IN LIFE. BUT FOR SOME REASON, AFTER DEATH, THEY HAVE A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON THAT, BUT THEY NEVER GOT TO ACTUALLY SEE THAT RESOLUTION COME TO FRUITION. AND SO, THEY COME BACK, AND THEY WANT TO MAKE AMENDS, AND THEY WANT TO MAKE IT RIGHT. SO, I HAD A VERY LENGTHY CONVERSATION WITH HOLLY TODAY, AND I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HER, AND SHE HAD A TERRIBLE RELATIONSHIP WITH HER MOTHER. THERE ARE SOME THINGS HERE OF HER MOM'S. MAINLY, THERE'S A PYRAMID IN MEGHAN'S ROOM -- THIS LITTLE GLASS PYRAMID -- THAT SHE REFUSES TO LET ANYBODY TOUCH BECAUSE SHE SAYS, WHEN THAT PYRAMID GETS MOVED, ACTIVITY GOES CRAZY IN THE HOUSE. Berry: OKAY. SO, WE'RE GONNA MOVE IT? OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA MOVE IT. OKAY. GREAT. ♪♪ Bruni: ALL RIGHT. SO, WE'RE GONNA DO THE SPIRIT BOX, RIGHT? THE SPIRIT BOX SCANS RADIO FREQUENCIES AND ALLOWS ENTITIES TO MANIPULATE THOSE FREQUENCIES. WITH EVPS, WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR A PLAYBACK TO MAKE OUT ANY MESSAGES. THE SPIRIT BOX RESPONDS IN REAL-TIME. THE BLINDFOLD AND THE NOISE-CANCELING HEADPHONES MAKE SURE I CAN'T HEAR ANY OF ADAM'S QUESTIONS. I'LL GO INTO MATT'S ROOM, 'CAUSE THEY HEARD THE VOICE IN THERE. OKAY. I'M READY. I'M GOING. [ STATIC PLAYING ] ALL RIGHT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE WITH US? THE KIDS WERE PLAYING DOWN HERE WHEN THEY HEARD A VOICE. IS HOLLY'S MOM HERE? ADAM, SOMETHING JUST TOUCHED ME. WHAT? WHO'S TOUCHING AMY? YOU CAN'T TOUCH AMY. I DON'T WANT YOU TO, OKAY? DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING? [ STATIC CONTINUES ] CAN YOU TELL US WHAT YOUR NAME IS? ARE YOU RELATED TO HOLLY? Bruni: DO NOT... WITHOUT... WE MOVED THAT PYRAMID. THE FLOOR. ♪♪ Berry: WE MOVED THAT PYRAMID. THE FLOOR. DO YOU WANT US TO MOVE THE PYRAMID BACK? AMY? WHAT? SO, I LEFT THAT ROOM AFTER YOU SAID YOU GOT TOUCHED. I CAME IN HERE... - YEAH. ...BECAUSE I WANTED TO KEEP AN EYE ON YOU. I KEPT ASKING FOR A NAME. I KEPT ASKING FOR A NAME. NOTHING WAS MATCHING UP EXCEPT FOR, YOU JUST KEPT REFERENCING THE FLOOR, LIKE, THE PYRAMID WAS ON THE FLOOR. OH. BUT NOTHING ELSE SPECIFICALLY, LIKE, MATCHED UP, EVER. IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE, WE GOT A RESPONSE WHEN WE ASKED ABOUT MOVING IT, BUT NOTHING WHEN WE ASKED ABOUT HER MOM. I MEAN, WE'RE NOT GETTING A LOT DOWN HERE. LET'S GO BACK TO THE MASTER BEDROOM, WHERE WE GOT RESPONSES LAST NIGHT. ♪♪ SO, WHOEVER IS HERE, ARE YOU RELATED TO ANYONE IN THIS HOUSE? HOLLY THINKS YOU MIGHT BE HER MOM. YOU CAN TALK TO US. THEY GAVE US FULL REIN OF THE HOUSE WHILE THEY'RE GONE. WE ARE WELCOME HERE. WE WERE INVITED HERE. [ UNEXPLAINED STATIC NOISE ] WAIT. GO BACK. [ UNEXPLAINED STATIC NOISE ] DID THAT SAY "CINDY"? - YEAH. THAT SAYS "CINDY" SO LOUD. - YES. CLEAR AS DAY. WHO'S CINDY? THE NEIGHBOR. [ GASPS ] THAT'S A REALLY CLEAR EVP. YEAH. "CINDY." THAT SOUNDS... THAT'S THE CLEAREST I'VE HEARD IT. WHY WOULD HOLLY'S MOM SAY "CINDY"? WE NEED TO TALK TO HER. ♪♪ ALL RIGHT. SO, CINDY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING US KIND OF BARGE INTO YOUR HOUSE UNEXPECTEDLY. OH, NO PROBLEM. WE WERE TALKING WITH HOLLY ACROSS THE STREET, AND HOLLY HAS MENTIONED THAT YOU HAD SOME EXPERIENCES FROM HERE. YOU'VE ACTUALLY SEEN SOMEONE IN THE WINDOW. CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT FOR US? YES. ACTUALLY, THE TALL THIN WINDOW THAT IS STRAIGHT OVER WITH THE LITTLE ARCHWAY ON IT, I'D LOOK OUT, AND IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS A FORM STANDING IN THE WINDOW. - OH, GEEZ. - OH, GOD. SO, IT JUST LOOKED LIKE THE OUTLINE OF A FIGURE STANDING THERE, LIKE, SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO GET SOMEONE'S ATTENTION OVER THERE. AND YOU COULD TELL THEY WEREN'T HOME BECAUSE THE LIGHTS WERE OFF, YOU KNOW. Berry: OKAY. DIDN'T APPEAR ANYBODY WAS THERE. THE TV WASN'T ON OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, TO CREATE THAT. - WELL, THAT'S INTERESTING. - YEAH. DO YOU KNOW IF THE PREVIOUS HOMEOWNERS...? YES. THERE WAS ACTUALLY A COUPLE, STEVE AND PAT. AND HOW LONG DID YOU KNOW THEM? PROBABLY SINCE THE MID '80S, I KNEW THEM. I WAS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. THEY MOVED IN SOMETIME AROUND THERE. WE FOUND THAT BOARD THAT'S IN THE BASEMENT WITH THE ALL THE SOUVENIRS FROM THEIR TRIPS. OH, YEAH. THEY LOVED TO TRAVEL. THEY TRAVELED ALL OVER THE PLACE. THEY MUST HAVE REALLY BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER. OH, THEY WERE. YES. THEY VERY MUCH WERE. I WOULD GO AND HELP THEM OUT. A COUPLE YEARS AFTER THEY WERE HERE, THERE WAS AN ACCIDENT AND PAT ENDED UP IN A WHEELCHAIR. SO, SHE HAD LIMITED MOBILITY, BUT SHE STILL GOT AROUND. AND I'D GO OVER AND SHE'D BE WEEDING THE GARDEN, AND I'D GO PULL HER OUT OF THE MUD. NOW, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAD A REALLY SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. YEAH. I HAVE SOME SOME THINGS THAT BELONGED TO PAT THAT SHE HAD LEFT ME AFTER SHE PASSED AWAY. WHAT DID SHE LEAVE YOU? SHE ACTUALLY LEFT ME HER ENGAGEMENT RING... WOW. ...A HEART PENDANT, AND A PAIR OF STUD EARRINGS. - OKAY. - OH. THOSE ARE VERY SPECIAL THINGS. YEAH. SHE DIDN'T HAVE A DAUGHTER. SO, SHE KIND OF, I GUESS, ADOPTED ME. DO YOU KNOW HOW THEY PASSED AWAY? THEY FOUND THAT SHE HAD MS. SO, THAT JUST -- IT'S -- KIND OF STEMMED FROM THAT. AND HE HAD A RECURRENCE OF THE HODGKINS, BUT THEY BOTH PASSED AWAY IN THE HOUSE. Bruni: THERE'S A LOT MORE GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE THAN WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. THE FORMER HOMEOWNERS, PAT AND STEVE, LIVED HERE FOR YEARS, BUT THEY ALSO DIED HERE. WE NEED TO STEP AWAY AND COME UP WITH A NEW GAME PLAN. SO, THIS CASE IS PRETTY CRAZY. IT'S DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT, THE PEOPLE WE'RE DEALING WITH HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING THIS ACTIVITY IN THEIR HOUSE FOR QUITE FOR SOME TIME. AND TO HOLLY, ESPECIALLY, SHE JUST KIND OF ASSUMED IT WAS HER MOM BECAUSE HER MOM DIED RIGHT AROUND THE TIME THEY BOTH THIS HOUSE. SO, CINDY, SHE'S SEEING ACTIVITY. WE NEED TO, LIKE, GET IN THAT HOUSE AND MONITOR THAT SITUATION. I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON. WHAT I THINK IS INTERESTING ABOUT THIS IS THAT, WE BASICALLY HAVE TWO LOCATIONS. BUT ONE THING I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON IS THE STUFF. I FEEL LIKE THE OBJECTS HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. I MEAN, THEY HAVE A LARGE COLLAGE OF EVERYTHING THE PREVIOUS HOMEOWNERS EVER DID TOGETHER. YOU KNOW, AND THEN, HERE'S CINDY, WHO HAS SOME OF THE BELONGINGS OF THE FORMER OWNERS, PAT AND STEVE. SHE MIGHT NOT EVEN REALIZE THERE COULD BE SOME SORT OF ATTACHMENT TO WHAT SHE HAS. AND I'M BETTING THAT TOM AND HOLLY HAVE NO IDEA, EITHER, THAT ALL THESE OBJECTS COULD BE INVOLVED. WE NEED TO GET INTO CINDY'S HOUSE. LIKE, WE HAVE TO GET INTO CINDY'S HOUSE AND START MONITORING THE OTHER HOUSE. - WE NEED HELP. - RIGHT. [ LIGHT BUZZES ] WE HAVE SOME FRIENDS NAMED GREG AND DANA. THEY'RE PERFECT FOR THIS CASE. THEY HAVE A COMBINED 35 YEARS EXPERIENCE SPECIALIZING IN HAUNTED OBJECTS, WHICH WE HAVE A LOT OF. BUT GREG AND DANA ARE ALSO SKILLED PARANORMAL INVESTIGATORS, WHICH IS GOOD, BECAUSE NOW, WE HAVE TWO LOCATIONS, AND WE CAN'T BE IN BOTH PLACES AT ONCE. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - WELL, A LOT. BASICALLY, WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS, WE HAVE TWO LOCATIONS. YOU KNOW, THIS PLACE, THERE ARE SOME OBJECTS THAT WE FEEL LIKE THE FORMER OWNERS MIGHT BE VERY ATTACHED TO. AND THEN, WE BROUGHT SOME OBJECTS FROM NEXT DOOR, AS WELL, THAT WE THINK THEY MIGHT BE ATTACHED TO. SO, I THINK OUR HOPE IS TO, MAYBE, SPLIT UP, AND YOU GUYS CAN STAY HERE AND KEEP MONITORING THESE OBJECTS WHILE WE GO ACROSS THE STREET. BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY SEE AN APPARITION IN THIS WINDOW. AND THEN, AFTER THAT, WE CAN ALL INVESTIGATE TOGETHER DOWNSTAIRS FOR A BIT. ABSOLUTELY. SO, THIS IS WHERE THEY HAVE... THEY'VE HAD ACTIVITY DOWN HERE, BUT THERE'S ALSO THIS AMAZING BOARD. I HAVE THESE OBJECTS, WHICH IS A PAIR OF EARRINGS IN HERE, THE ENGAGEMENT RING, AND THE NECKLACE. SO, YOU GUYS CAN USE THESE, FOR SURE. WONDERFUL. Dana: WE BROUGHT THE DARK MIRROR, WHICH CHARGES UP THE ENERGY IN A PLACE, AND A LOT OF MANIFESTATIONS TEND TO HAPPEN AROUND THE MIRROR ITSELF. - YEAH. OKAY. - AWESOME. WHEN WE INVESTIGATE A HOUSE, WE ARE IN THAT HOUSE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE EVER GONE TO ANOTHER LOCATION TO DO A GHOST STAKEOUT ON A HOME. HOPEFULLY, GREG AND DANA INVESTIGATING AROUND THE ITEMS WILL HELP STIR UP WHATEVER IS HERE. AND WE GET TO TRY TO EXPERIENCE WHAT CINDY HAS SEEN FROM ACROSS THE STREET. SO, FROM HERE, I MEAN, I SEE GREG AND DANA WALKING AROUND. - YEAH. YOU CAN -- - SO YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE -- YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE SOMEBODY. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ONE OF THEM WALK IN FRONT OF THAT WINDOW, AND THEN WE COULD SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. CAN ONE OF YOU GUYS WALK UPSTAIRS and get in front of that window that we're looking at? DANA: Do you want me to go, or do you want... GREG: Dana will go. All right. I'm here. SHE'S IN THE WINDOW NOW? ARE YOU IN THE WINDOW RIGHT NOW? - I'M IN THE WINDOW. - OH, THERE SHE IS. CAN YOU WALK IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW FROM YOUR LEFT TO RIGHT? YOU GOT IT. ♪♪ GO BACK. And go back. OKAY. I SEE THAT. - MM-HMM. OKAY. DO WE LET HER GO BACK TO HER INVESTIGATION? YEAH. LET HER GO. ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN GO BACK DOWNSTAIRS. THANKS SO MUCH, DANA. NO PROBLEM. OKAY. I'M GONNA START WITH A SESSION. MM-HMM. IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THIS BASEMENT WITH US, WE'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D COME DOWN AND SAY, "HELLO." WE'VE HEARD THAT YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE LIKED THE FACT THAT THIS MURAL WAS REMOVED. IS THAT TRUE? - PLAY IT BACK. - CALL THAT GOOD? MM-HMM. [ TAPE RECORDER CLICKS ] Bruni: I KNOW THAT, LIKE, CINDY DOESN'T SEE IT ALL THE TIME, BUT THE REALITY IS, IS WE ARE RILING THINGS UP OVER THERE RIGHT NOW, 'CAUSE NOT ONLY HAVE WE BEEN INVESTIGATING, BUT NOW, WE JUST BROUGHT GREG AND DANA HERE. IT LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE IS STANDING IN THAT WINDOW. WAIT A MINUTE. IS ANYBODY UP THERE? Tom: If there's anyone in this basement with us, we'd really appreciate it if you'd come down and say, "Hello." - [ GASPS ] - "PUT IT BACK." OH, MY GOD. ♪♪ Bruni: ADAM AND I NORMALLY INVESTIGATE A HOME'S ACTIVITY FROM THE INSIDE. IT'S NOT OFTEN WE'RE INVESTIGATING A CLAIM THAT SPIRITS CAN BE SEEN FROM ANOTHER HOUSE. THE ACTIVITY JUST PICKED UP ON THE TOP FLOOR THE EXACT TIME GREG AND DANA STARTING GETTING SOME RESPONSES IN THE BASEMENT. - [ GASPS ] - "PUT IT BACK." OH, MY GOD. IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE, IT LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE's STANDING IN THAT WINDOW. IS ANYBODY UPSTAIRS? Dana: Nope. No one's up there. I ABSOLUTELY, 100%, SAW SOMEBODY WALK IN FRONT OF THAT WINDOW. - THAT'S WEIRD. - THAT'S VERY WEIRD. OKAY. LET'S GO BACK OVER THERE. Bruni: IT WAS A CRAZY EXPERIENCE TO ACTUALLY SEE WHAT CINDY SEES. I REALLY THINK US BEING HERE IS TRIGGERING SOMETHING TO COME OUT, AND TO ACTUALLY SEE IT IS PRETTY COMPELLING. I SAW, DISTINCTLY, SOMEONE MOVE ACROSS THE WINDOWS UPSTAIRS, AND I SAY DISTINCTLY, "OH, SHE'S STILL UP THERE, RIGHT?" I'M LIKE, "WAIT, ISN'T SHE STILL UP THERE?" AND THAT'S WHEN I WALKIED OVER, YOU ARE NOT UP HERE. - MNH-MNH. - NO. SO, WHAT HAPPENED? I WANT TO PLAY WHAT WE GOT, AND I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT WE HEARD. OH, RIGHT THERE. "PUT IT BACK." - YEAH, "PUT IT BACK." - "PUT IT BACK." - MM-HMM. - IT IS REALLY QUIET. LET'S ASK SOME MORE QUESTIONS. ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO DESTROY THIS ART PIECE? WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU HAVE A MESSAGE. IS THAT THE CASE? ARE YOU OKAY WITH THE CHANGES THEY'VE MADE TO THE HOUSE? DO THE CHANGES BOTHER YOU? LET'S LISTEN AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING. - OH, MY GOD. - IT SOUNDED LIKE... WHAT DOES IT SAY? - "NO WAY." - I COULD HEAR THAT. YEAH. I DON'T THINK -- YEAH, THEY KNOW. IT DEFINITELY APPEARS THEY DON'T LIKE WHEN THINGS GET MOVED. BUT THIS "NO WAY" EVP SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE NOT ANGRY AND TRUST HOLLY AND TOM WILL KEEP THEIR MURAL IN PLACE. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON HERE? IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE VERY READY TO TALK. I THINK WHAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENING VERY INTENTLY BEFORE. ALL RIGHT. WELL, THANK YOU, GUYS, AND WE'LL -- YEAH. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW HOW EVERYTHING TURNS OUT. PLEASE DO. I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT. YES, PLEASE. ♪♪ I THINK HER MOM IS NOT HERE. I MEAN... NO. I DON'T. I HAVEN'T -- I MEAN, WE'VE GOTTEN NOTHING. I JUST REALLY WANTED TO GIVE HOLLY AN ANSWER. I MEAN, IF PAT AND STEVE ARE HERE, THEN I THINK WE NEED TO GET CINDY OVER HERE. YEAH. GET MORE ANSWERS. YEAH. SO LET'S DO THAT. LET'S JUST SEE IF SHE'LL COME OVER AND INVESTIGATE WITH US. Berry: WE GOT AN EVP ABOUT THE FORMER HOMEOWNERS, PAT AND STEVE'S, TRAVEL BOARD. BUT THAT'S ONLY ONE EVP. MEGHAN SEES A MALE SHADOW FIGURE, AND BOTH THE KIDS HEARD A FEMALE VOICE. COULD BOTH PAT AND STEVE BE HERE? OR IS SOMEONE ELSE HERE? WE CAN'T RULE ANYTHING OUT. VERY EARLY ON IN THIS INVESTIGATION, WE'RE GETTING RESPONSES TO CINDY. WE'RE GETTING CINDY'S NAME. SO, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BRING CINDY INTO THIS INVESTIGATION. WE NEED TO SEE IF WHOEVER'S HERE IS GONNA REACT TO WHEN WE BRING HER IN. LET'S GRAB SOME EQUIPMENT. ♪♪ SO, LET'S DO THIS. WHAT THIS IS, IS IT'S A PROXIMITY SENSOR. THE PROXIMITY SENSOR GIVES OFF AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD AROUND OBJECTS IT'S ATTACHED TO. IF ANYTHING THAT CONDUCTS ELECTRICITY DISTURBS THAT FIELD, AN ALARM SOUNDS TO LET US KNOW. LITERALLY, IF I GET CLOSE IT, THIS IS NOW A CONDUCTOR. SO, I FEEL, LIKE... - OH. IF ANYONE REACHES OUT TO TOUCH IT... YEAH. THE ALARM GOES OFF. IT'S PRETTY HANDY. I MEAN, I GUESS, MAYBE, YOU CAN HELP US FIGURE OUT IF WHY. I MEAN, LIKE, WHY. DO THEY LIKE THE CHANGES? DO THEY LIKE THE THINGS? QUESTION -- HOW TALL WAS STEVE, WOULD YOU SAY? WAS HE A TALL MAN?

NOW, WE'RE GOING TO PRESENT THE REST OF THE EVIDENCE TO TOM AND HOLLY. Berry: HOW ARE YOU GUYS FEELING RIGHT NOW? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? Holly: I REALLY HAVE NO IDEA. I JUST WANT TO KNOW. WE DEFINITELY -- WE TRIED TO REACH OUT TO YOUR MOM, AND WE TRIED TIME AND TIME AGAIN. WE JUST HAMMERED DOWN AND JUST TRIED TO GET HER TO TALK TO US. YOU KNOW, I REALLY WANTED TO GET A -- I WAS JUST DESPERATE TO GET A MESSAGE FROM HER, SOMETHING FOR YOU, AND IT WAS JUST REALLY HARD FOR ME TO BE DONE INVESTIGATING AND JUST NOT GET ANYTHING. I JUST DON'T -- I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE TRIED REALLY HARD. OH, THAT'S OKAY. - YEAH. - YEAH. WELL, ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO US, WE SETTLED, YOU KNOW, IN THIS LIVING ROOM BECAUSE WE WANTED TO FIGURE OUT THE SHADOW THAT YOU GUYS SEE AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY. MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE SOMETHING THAT BLOCKED OUT THE DOORFRAME. SO, WE WERE STARING DOWN AT THE HALLWAY, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS THING WAS LIKE BLOOP AND WENT AWAY REALLY QUICKLY. SO, WE KEEP GOING, AND WE'RE LIKE, "OKAY. WELL, MAYBE SOMETHING IS HERE." SO, THIS WAS IN YOUR BEDROOM. - IT IS "CINDY." - YEAH. THAT WAS WHEN WE DECIDED TO BRING CINDY INTO THE INVESTIGATION. WHAT WAS INTERESTING WAS, WHEN WE BROUGHT HER INTO THE INVESTIGATION, AND THAT'S WHEN THEY STARTED TALKING. AUTOMATICALLY, WE ASSUMED, "OKAY, WE'RE PROBABLY DEALING WITH PAT AND STEVE AT THIS POINT." BUT MEGHAN SEES THE MAN'S SHADOW. WELL, WE ASKED CINDY, AND WE SAID, YOU KNOW, "HOW TALL WAS STEVE?" AND SHE SAID, "STEVE WAS ABOUT EXACTLY ADAM'S HEIGHT." Berry: WHICH IS THE SHADOW HEIGHT THAT YOU GUYS SEE. YEAH. AND THAT'S WHAT MEGHAN DESCRIBED. OH, SHE DID. AND SO, THE NEXT ONE IS, I ASK, YOU KNOW, "WHEN THEY MOVE THINGS AROUND, DOES THAT AGITATE YOU A LITTLE BIT?" OH, OKAY. - OH, YEAH. - "IT DOES." - YES. - "IT DOES." - "IT DOES." - THEY'RE JUST BEING HONEST. - MM-HMM. OBVIOUSLY, WE KNOW PAT AND STEVE ARE REALLY NICE PEOPLE FROM EVERYTHING WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THEM. BUT I COULD SEE THEM GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS WHEN YOU START REALLY CHANGING THE HOUSE AROUND. I MEAN, WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME WHEN CONSTRUCTION HAPPENS OR WHEN PEOPLE CHANGE THE SCENERY OR PUT WALLS WHERE DOORS WERE, THAT THE ACTIVITY PICKS UP. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING, IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, IT DOES -- IT CONFUSES THEM. - RIGHT. - IT'S SOMETHING THAT OCCURS. I'M GONNA PLAY THIS FOR YOU. THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT THE COLLAGE. - THE BOARD? - YEAH. AND HE ASKS, "ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THEY'RE GONNA DESTROY THIS?" - "NO WAY." - "NO WAY." WHICH SPEAKS VOLUMES TO THE LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE IN YOU GUYS. I MEAN... YOU CAN HANG IT BACK UP. YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH IT. OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET RID OF IT. AND I MEAN, I THINK THAT THEY KNOW THAT YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT. - YES. - YOU KNOW? IT ALSO CONFIRMS THAT, YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT GET A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THE RENOVATIONS, THAT THEY'RE NOT CONCERNED THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA TOTALLY AFFECT THEM, IN A WAY, YOU KNOW? WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. I MEAN, I THINK WE AGREE. WE JUST DON'T THINK THEY WANT TO GO ANYWHERE, YOU KNOW? THIS WAS -- THEY ENJOY IT HERE. - THIS IS THEIR HOME. THEY'RE JUST HAPPY HERE, LIKE YOU'RE HAPPY HERE. - AND I WANT THEM TO BE HAPPY. - YEAH. IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD, WE GOT A WELCOMING FEELING FROM THEM. Holly: YOU DID? I MEAN, YES. THERE'S, LIKE, THE MOMENT WHERE YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, I THINK SOMEBODY IS WATCHING ME." AND THAT CAN ALWAYS MAKE YOU UNEASY, BUT REALLY, WHEN THINK ABOUT WHO IT IS, IT'S, LIKE, THEY'RE JUST CHECKING ON YOU. I THINK THERE WAS SOME CONCERN THAT, MAYBE, IT WOULD ESCALATE, ESPECIALLY WITH THE MORE WORK YOU DO IN THE HOUSE AND EVERYTHING, AND IT COULD, BUT I THINK, NOW THAT YOU KNOW WHO IT IS, NOW YOU CAN JUST CALL OUT TO THEM BY NAME, TALK TO THEM... RIGHT. RIGHT. ...LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BEFORE YOU DO IT. WELL, I'M GLAD THAT -- IT'S GLAD TO FINALLY KNOW WHO IT IS. - AWESOME. - THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. - GREAT. - IT'S SO RELIEVING TO KNOW THEY'RE OKAY WITH US HERE. - IT IS PRETTY COOL. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THOSE CASES THAT, REALLY, IT DOES HAVE A HAPPY ENDING. HOLLY DIDN'T GET A DIRECT MESSAGE FROM HER MOM, BUT SHE WAS STILL GIVEN A SENSE OF PEACE. THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE HERE, AND THE FACT THAT THEY CAN MAKE PAT AND STEVE STILL FEEL THIS WELCOME IN THEIR HOME EVEN AFTER THEY'VE PASSED AWAY -- I THINK TOO OFTEN PEOPLE WANT TO GET RID OF THEIR GHOSTS. BUT ONCE YOU REALIZE THEY'RE HERE FOR THE SAME REASONS YOU ARE, YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING. YOU DON'T SEE THAT VERY OFTEN.
