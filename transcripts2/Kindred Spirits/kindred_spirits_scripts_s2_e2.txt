YOU JUST WANT TO ENJOY YOUR HOUSE, BASICALLY. I JUST WANT TO, LIKE, "GO TO SLEEP AND BE HAPPY" KIND OF THING, YOU KNOW? AND IT'S LIKE... JASON IS LEGITIMATELY FREAKED OUT. HE'S TERRIFIED. TO HELP HIM, FIRST, WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO THIS EXECUTIONER, EDWIN DAVIS. THE FACT THAT HE LIVED HERE AND PUT PEOPLE TO DEATH FOR A LIVING MAKES HIM A PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR WHO'S CAUSING THE ACTIVITY. ♪♪ I'M MEETING A GENTLEMAN NAMED LARRY, AND HE OWNS A BAR THAT USED TO BE EDWIN DAVIS' WORKSHOP. I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HIM AND SEE IF I CAN FIND OUT ANY HISTORICAL INFORMATION ABOUT EDWIN DAVIS AND THIS AREA. NO. OKAY. SO, HOW LONG HAVE YOU OWNED THIS? 44 YEARS. YOU'VE OWNED THIS FOR 44 YEARS? YEAH. AND WHO OWNED IT BEFOREHAND? MY GRANDFATHER BOUGHT IT IN 1921 FROM EDWIN DAVIS, AND HE BUILT THE PLACE. IT WASN'T A BAR AND A RESTAURANT. OH, NO, NO. IT WAS A FEED MILL. DO YOU REMEMBER IT THAT WAY? LIKE, YOU REMEMBER IT WHEN IT WAS SET UP LIKE THAT? YES. IN FACT, WITHIN 5 FEET SOMEWHERE HERE, THERE WAS A ROOM, AND IN THE ROOM, IT HAD TWO ELECTRIC CHAIRS. OH. AND THERE WERE LEATHER STRAPS SO YOU COULD TIE THE PERSON DOWN. FOR SURE. HE WAS BUILDING THEM HERE? HE ACTUALLY PERFECTED IT IN THIS BUILDING. WOW. HE WOULD TAKE THE TRAIN UP TO AUBURN AND PULL THE SWITCH ON CRIMINALS OR WHATEVER THAT WERE FOUND GUILTY. AFTER TALKING WITH LARRY, IT'S CLEAR THAT EDWIN DAVIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG PART OF THIS INVESTIGATION. EDWIN, YOU KNOW, HE EXECUTED A LOT OF PEOPLE, SO THERE'S A LOT OF DARKNESS THAT COMES WITH THAT. ♪♪ SINCE JASON IS EXPERIENCING ACTIVITY IN JUST ABOUT EVERY ROOM, WE'LL BLANKET THE HOUSE WITH OUR DVR CAMERAS. ♪♪ ONE IN THE BASEMENT, TWO UPSTAIRS, ONE IN THE LIVING ROOM, ONE ON THE STAIRS.

HE'S HAD THIS REALLY EXTREME ACTIVITY, SO YOU'D THINK THAT WHATEVER IS HERE WOULD BE A LOT MORE EAGER TO TALK TO US. YEAH. WHERE ARE ALL THE NOISES JASON TALKED ABOUT? I MEAN, HONESTLY, THIS HOUSE IS MAKING ZERO NOISE. YOU KNOW, MOST OLD HOUSES, THEY AT LEAST CREAK OR SOMETHING. Berry: IT MAKES NO SENSE. JASON BELIEVES WHATEVER'S HERE IS DEMONIC AND MAY HAVE PUSHED HIM DOWN THE STAIRS. I MEAN, WHAT DID HE DO THAT BROUGHT THAT OUT, - THAT HE BROUGHT THESE -- - WAS IT CHRIS? I'M INTERESTED IN INTERVIEWING CHRIS. HE WAS HERE INVESTIGATING THE NIGHT JASON FELL. I WANT TO SEE WHAT OTHER EVIDENCE HE MAY HAVE CAUGHT. I WOULDN'T MIND SITTING DOWN AND INTERVIEWING JASON, TO BE HONEST. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT MORE THERE BESIDES -- OUTSIDE OF JUST HIS EXPERIENCES. SO LET'S DO THAT. WE HAVE THE CAMERAS RUNNING ALL NIGHT. LET'S LEAVE SOME RECORDERS RUNNING ALL NIGHT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. IN OUR OPINION, INEXPERIENCED INVESTIGATORS CAN SOMETIMES CAUSE MORE DAMAGE THAN GOOD, SO WE'RE GONNA SIT DOWN WITH JASON AND CHRIS TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THEIR INVESTIGATIONS.

HOW LONG DID YOU EXPERIENCE ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSE BEFORE CHRIS CAME IN AND STARTED TRYING TO HELP YOU? YEAH, SO, HE CAME IN THIS YEAR, BASICALLY, AND I'VE HAD IT SINCE I MOVED IN. BUT IT WAS, LIKE, A THREE-TIMES-A-YEAR EVENT. AND THEN WHEN HE CAME OVER, IT WAS EVERY NIGHT. SO, YOU THINK HIS INVESTIGATING KIND OF RILED THINGS UP HERE? YEAH. I CALL IT, LIKE, POKING THE BEAST, THAT KIND OF THING. SO, I MEAN, HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH THIS. THAT BOTHERS ME A LOT, ACTUALLY. YEAH. 'CAUSE HE'S ALL EXCITED AND STUFF, AND I'M LIKE, "SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT HERE." I JUST DON'T WANT SOMETHING DEMONIC IN THE HOUSE.

THEY'RE IN A PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE TO LITERALLY INVITE THIS THING IN, WHERE THEY SAY, "YES, YOU CAN TAKE ME," BASICALLY. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WHATEVER'S HERE IS SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES.

AND IT WAS A FEMALE. - THAT WAS VERY CLEAR. - RIGHT. AND HE WAS JUST LIKE, "THAT'S THE VOICE I HEAR ALL THE TIME," AND I'M THINKING, "MY GOD, YOU'RE JUST LIVING HERE WITH THIS THING." OF COURSE YOU'RE SCARED. BUT I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD PROBABLY MOVE DOWNSTAIRS, WHERE HE SAID HE HEARS THE VOICE THE MOST AND TRY TO TALK TO IT SOME MORE WITHOUT HIM HERE.

I THINK WE KNOW WHAT TO TELL HIM, AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST GONNA BE A MATTER OF, HOW IS HE GONNA TAKE IT? - IS HE GONNA BELIEVE US? - YEAH. I DON'T KNOW. ♪♪ THIS WAS AN INTERESTING CASE FOR US. IT WAS. WE RESEARCHED EDWIN DAVIS TO... A "T." TO A "T." I SPOKE WITH AN AUTHOR IN LONDON. I MET WITH LARRY DOWN AT THE BAR. WE USED ALL THIS INFORMATION IN OUR INVESTIGATION. BUT IT WAS JUST QUIET FOR US. REALLY SILENT. NOTHING HAPPENED. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SOMETHING'S NOT HERE. WE HAVE SOME EVIDENCE TO SHOW YOU FROM OUR SECURITY CAMERAS. SO I'M GONNA PLAY IT FOR YOU. HERE WE GO. ♪♪ WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? - YOU SEE THAT? - **** YOU SEE THAT? HERE, IT'S GONNA REPEAT. ♪♪ THAT'S NOT RIGHT. I'M SORRY. SO, YOU KIND OF SEE A LITTLE MOVEMENT, AND THEN YOU SEE WHAT APPEARS TO BE, LIKE, AN ANOMALY ON THE SCREEN, AND THEN IT GOES AWAY. THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS. RIGHT. AND IT FOLLOWS THE TRAJECTORY OF THE STAIRS. WE DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING NEGATIVE. WE DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING TO BE AFRAID OF. AND WE DON'T THINK THAT IT PUSHED YOU DOWN THE STAIRS. THE EVP's GONNA EXPLAIN WHY. - THIS IS ONE WHERE WE ASK, YOU KNOW, "DO YOU LIKE JASON?" - MM-HMM. SO, GO AHEAD AND LISTEN. ♪♪ YEAH. YES. WHOEVER THIS IS LIKES YOU, AND THAT'S A GOOD THING, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU FELT MAYBE LIKE IT COULD BE A BAD THING, - AND I THINK, AT THIS POINT, WE'VE RULED THAT OUT. - YEAH. IT'S NOT A NEGATIVE THING. BUT THEN THERE'S THIS FEMALE. WE HEARD THE VOICE WITH YOU, THE DISEMBODIED VOICE. SO WE START THINKING, "WHO COULD IT BE?" AND THAT'S KIND OF WHEN WE HAD THIS EPIPHANY, BECAUSE THE ACTIVITY DIDN'T START UNTIL YOU MOVED IN HERE. RIGHT. AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT THE PREVIOUS OWNER, THE WIFE -- HER NAME WAS MARJORIE. SHE PASSED AWAY BEFORE YOU BOUGHT THE HOUSE. SO, WE STARTED THINKING, "COULD IT BE THIS WOMAN?" AND SHE WAS VERY RELIGIOUS. SHE LIVED TO BE 80 YEARS OLD. SO, WE REACHED OUT TO HER AND GOT THIS EVP. ♪♪ I HEAR SOMETHING CHILDREN, BUT I CAN'T MAKE OUT THE NUMBER. IT SAYS, "I HAVE FIVE CHILDREN." MARJORIE DID HAVE FIVE CHILDREN, AND SHE ALSO HAD A HUSBAND NAMED EDWARD, AND WE THINK HE'S HERE WITH HER. CHECK OUT THIS EVP. ♪♪ IT'S "EDWARD." IT'S "EDWARD." - IT'S CLEARLY "EDWARD." - YEAH. IT MAKES MORE SENSE. ONCE I HEARD THAT, I THOUGHT, "SHE AND HER HUSBAND, EDWARD, ARE JUST STILL HERE WITH YOU." AND, HONESTLY, WE TALKED TO HER A LOT LAST NIGHT. WE TOLD HER EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND ONCE WE SAID THAT NICE PRAYER FOR HER, IT WAS, YOU KNOW... - IT MIGHT EVEN ALREADY BE SCALED WAY BACK FOR YOU. - YEAH. I'M -- I'M... THANK YOU. [ LAUGHS ] IT'S GOOD TO KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY. WELL, WE JUST HAVE ONE MORE THING TO TALK ABOUT. I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO YOUR FRIEND CHRIS, AND MY ADVICE TO CHRIS WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, - LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE... - MM-HMM. ...AND, YOU KNOW, - STOP INVESTIGATING THIS HOUSE. - YEAH. I CAN GO WITH THAT. WE'LL TELL THEM FOR YOU IF YOU WANT. I TOLD THEM THAT MULTIPLE TIMES. I THINK THAT THE WAY THEY APPROACHED IT KIND OF RILED THEM UP AND CONFUSED THEM. AND SO, I THINK WHEN YOU WERE HERE BY YOURSELF, THEY WERE TRYING TO GET YOUR ATTENTION, TO SAY, "YOU KNOW, WHY ARE YOU GUYS TREATING US LIKE THIS? WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO US LIKE THIS?" YOU KNOW, THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO MAYBE RIGHT THINGS, AND IT KIND OF INSTIGATED MORE ACTIVITY FOR YOU. AND SO, NOW I THINK YOU KNOW WHO'S HERE, AND THAT'S GONNA MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. I THINK YOUR ACTIVITY LEVEL'S GONNA GO WAY BACK. WE WOULD SUGGEST, YOU KNOW, MOVING BACK UPSTAIRS. - I THINK IT WILL MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD FOR YOU. - MM-HMM. - I'M STILL IN SHOCK, ACTUALLY. - SO, BUT... IT'S A GOOD SHOCK, THOUGH? - YOU FEEL GOOD? - YEAH. I'M LIKE... IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, I GUESS, SO... IT NEVER IS. NO, IT'S NEVER WHAT WE EXPECT EITHER, TO BE HONEST. I MEAN, WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE FIRST EXECUTIONER OF NEW YORK POSSIBLY, AND WE GOT A SWEET OLD LADY. - THE OPPOSITE. - MM-HMM. YEAH, YEAH. SO... - BUT, NO. THANKS A LOT, THOUGH. THIS IS -- IT HELPED. I THINK IT'S ON THE ROAD TO IMPROVEMENT. - THAT'S FOR SURE. - WELL, THANK YOU. THANKS FOR HAVING US. IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST A PHONE CALL AWAY. THIS CASE ABOVE ANY OTHER HAS BEEN A VALUABLE LESSON FOR INVESTIGATIONS AND INVESTIGATORS AND WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING GOOD WHEN, IN FACT, YOU'RE DOING MORE HARM. THANK YOU. THANKS A LOT. OF COURSE. WE CAME IN HERE THINKING THAT THIS HOUSE HAD SOME CRAZY THINGS GOING ON. AND WE WERE VERY SURPRISED BY THE OUTCOME, AS USUAL. AND I THINK THAT JASON IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ON FROM THIS, AND THERE WILL BE NO MORE INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS HOUSE. ♪♪
