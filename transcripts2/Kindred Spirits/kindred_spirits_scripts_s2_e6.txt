 Bruni: I'M AMY BRUNI. I WAS ONLY 8 WHEN A PARANORMAL INCIDENT CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER. [ GIRL LAUGHS ] SINCE THEN, I'VE DEDICATED MY TIME TO SOLVING THE MOST TERRIFYING HAUNTINGS IMAGINABLE. Berry: I'M ADAM BERRY. MORE THAN A DECADE AGO, AN ENCOUNTER AT GETTYSBURG ROCKED MY BELIEFS ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL. Bruni: TOGETHER, WE UNCOVER THE TRUTH BEHIND THE UNEXPLAINABLE. - OH. - OH, MY GOD. Berry: NOW WE ARE ON OUR MOST IMPORTANT MISSION YET. ♪♪

 Bruni: HELPING FAMILIES OVERCOME THEIR FEAR, TAKE BACK THEIR HOMES, AND RECLAIM THEIR LIVES. Tracy: HI, AMY. THIS IS TRACY IN LAKELAND, FLORIDA. THIS WOMAN, TRACY, SHE IS FREAKED OUT. LATELY, SOMETHING'S BEEN HAPPENING THAT HAS REALLY PUT US OVER THE EDGE. YOU KNOW, SHE'S HAD THIS ACTIVITY IN HER HOME - FOR A LONG TIME. - OKAY. BUT THE BIG THING IS THAT... I HEAR THIS LOUD, AGGRESSIVE GROWLING ALMOST EVERY NIGHT. UGH. AND THE GROWLS, TO HER, JUST ARE NOT OKAY. MY HUSBAND'S HEARD IT, TOO, AND WE ARE TERRIFIED. SHE CRIES WHEN SHE TALKS TO ME ABOUT IT. SHE'S THAT UPSET. IT FEELS VERY HOSTILE, AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO TURN. - SHALL WE? - YES. Tracy: AMY, ADAM, PLEASE HELP US. ♪♪ Bruni: FOR US TO COME ALL THE WAY TO FLORIDA JUST KIND OF TELLS HOW SERIOUS THIS CASE IS. WE COULD TELL TALKING TO TRACY THAT SHE WAS TRULY FRIGHTENED. TRACY'S HEARING GROWLING. THAT COULD BE DISCONCERTING FOR ANYBODY. IN OUR EXPERIENCE, GROWLING CAN BE A SIGNIFICANT CLUE THAT SOMETHING NEGATIVE OR AGGRESSIVE COULD BE PRESENT. Bruni: YOU ESPECIALLY SOUNDED PRETTY FREAKED OUT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING LATELY, SO... KIND OF JUST GIVE US A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE HEAR A LOT OF NOISES, ESPECIALLY FROM THIS ROOM THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE THE TV IS ON. Tom: MM-HMM. VERY LOUD. AND YET YOU CANNOT HEAR EXACT WORDS. [ WARBLED STATIC ] - I HEAR FLUTES. - MM-HMM. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT. AND I HAVE TO ASK, "STOP. PLEASE. LEAVE ME ALONE." - AND DOES IT STOP? - NO. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE HOUSE? - WE BOUGHT IT -- -19 YEARS. YEAH, AND WE BOUGHT IT BRAND-NEW. -19 YEARS? OKAY. -19 YEARS. SO, YEAH, IT'S NOT LIKE SOMETHING HAPPENED HERE BEFORE YOU GOT HERE, BECAUSE IT WAS BRAND NEW. - RIGHT. - BRAND-NEW HOME. Bruni: WE USUALLY LOOK INTO PREVIOUS HOMEOWNERS AS POTENTIAL SUSPECTS, BUT WE MIGHT BE DEALING WITH SOMETHING CONNECTED TO THE LAND ITSELF, BECAUSE TOM AND TRACY ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED IN THIS HOUSE. Berry: OTHER THAN THAT, HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED ANY OTHER ACTIVITY IN THIS ROOM? Tracy: THAT IS THE ACTIVE CORNER. WHY DO YOU CALL IT THAT? 'CAUSE ALL THE ANIMALS WE'VE EVER HAD WILL COME OVER HERE, STOP, LOOK IN THAT CORNER. THEY'LL KIND OF GET SKITTISH AT FIRST, AND THEN THEY START WAGGING THEIR TAIL LIKE THERE'S SOMEBODY THERE THAT'S CALLING THEIR NAME OR SAYING SOMETHING TO THEM. - MM-HMM. - YEP. Berry: HAS THE PICTURES AND THE FRAME ALWAYS BEEN THERE? NO. I MADE THAT FRAME AFTER MY MOM... - OH, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. - ...PASSED AWAY. - WE LOST HER TO CANCER. - AND WHAT WAS HER NAME? - BARBARA. - BARBARA. SO, IN HERE, KAYLA WAS SLEEPING, AND SHE FELT LIKE SHE SAW SOMEBODY IN THE DOORWAY... Bruni: MM-HMM. ...AND HE KEPT PEEKING AROUND THE CORNER AT HER. - OKAY. - WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE? A GENTLEMAN, VERY TALL -- NEAR THE HEIGHT OF THE DOORWAY. AND AFTER THAT, SHE NEVER SLEPT WITH THE DOOR OPEN. SHE WAS REALLY SCARED. THIS ROOM IS ACTUALLY QUITE -- QUITE, QUITE ACTIVE BECAUSE OF THE GROWLING. Bruni: DID IT SOUND LIKE AN ANIMAL, OR DID IT SOUND LIKE A PERSON GROWLING? Tom: IT ALWAYS SOUNDED LIKE A PERSON. IT DID NOT SOUND LIKE A DOG. THE GROWLING IS AGGRESSIVE. I MEAN, TO ANYONE WHO'S HAVING PARANORMAL ACTIVITY, A GROWL IN THEIR HOUSE IS REALLY FRIGHTENING AND REALLY INTENSE. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT FEAR ON TRACY'S FACE. Berry: ANY SPECIFIC DIRECTION IS IT COMING FROM? IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE IT'S, LIKE, RIGHT HERE. OKAY. Bruni: ALL RIGHT. ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS AREA? - TOUCHING. - MM-HMM. TOUCHING. A LOT. IF I LAY ON MY SIDE, THEY WANT TO TOUCH MY LEG. - MM-HMM. - SOMETIMES IT'S A SINGLE PAT. SOMETIMES IT'S A COUPLE PATS. OKAY. Berry: ANYTHING BELONGING TO YOUR MOTHER SPECIFICALLY IN THE HOUSE? Tom: YES. I DO HAVE A NECKLACE IN HERE THAT WAS MY MOTHER'S. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I BROUGHT HOME WITH ME, SO... - OKAY. - OKAY. JUST SOME SPECIAL THINGS. - YEAH. YEAH. - MAKES SENSE. IF YOU HAD TO GUESS ABOUT WHAT WAS HERE, IS IT SOMEBODY YOU KNOW OR IS IT NOT? I WOULD HOPE THAT IT IS A FAMILY MEMBER, ON THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT MEANT TO SCARE ME. BUT THE GROWLS, I- I REALLY DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A FAMILY MEMBER. I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD DO THAT. Tom: I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S ATTACHED TO THE HOUSE. I THINK IT'S ATTACHED TO MY WIFE. IF THIS DOESN'T STAY HERE, IT GOES WITH US. HAVE YOU HAD THESE EXPERIENCES ANYWHERE ELSE? LIKE -- OR...? WE -- WE HAVE. WE'VE HAD EXPERIENCES IN -- I WOULD SAY MOST HOTELS. AND -- AND YOU BASE THAT ON THE FACT THAT THE ACTIVITY IS SIMILAR, LIKE YOU'RE HEARING THE WHISTLE, YOU'RE HEARING THE GROWL? OR WHAT DO YOU BASE THAT ON? SO, WE WENT TO A HOTEL FOR OUR ANNIVERSARY IN CLEARWATER BEACH, AND WE WERE ON A BALCONY, 'CAUSE IT WAS AN UPSTAIRS-DOWNSTAIRS, AND WE HAD TURNED ALL OF THE LIGHTS OFF AND THE CEILING FAN OFF DOWNSTAIRS. AND AROUND 2:00 OR 3:00 IN THE MORNING, THE LIGHTS CAME ON AND THE CEILING FAN CAME ON. - AND WE WERE UPSTAIRS. - YES. AND THERE IS NO WAY THAT ANYBODY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE ROOM. THERE'S NO WAY ANYBODY COULD HAVE GOT IN THE ROOM. OKAY. Bruni: THIS ISN'T OUR AVERAGE CASE. WHENEVER PEOPLE FEEL AS THOUGH A SPIRIT IS STALKING THEM, IT CAN BE DEBILITATING BECAUSE ACTIVITY SEEMS TO FOLLOW THEM EVERYWHERE. BEFORE WE GET STARTED, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT? Tracy: YES. I WAS COMING HOME FROM THE STORE LAST NIGHT, AND I PANICKED BECAUSE I SAW SOMEBODY DART FROM OUR DRIVEWAY ALONGSIDE THE HOUSE. Tom: SHE CALLED ME CRYING, SAID, "TOM, WHERE YOU AT?" "WHERE YOU AT?" I SAID, "THERE IS SOMEBODY OUTSIDE." AND HE TRIED TO SAY, "OH, IT WAS PROBABLY THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBORS." - NO. I KNOW WHAT I SAW. - MM-HMM. I KNOW WHAT I SAW. THIS WAS ABOUT 10:30 LAST NIGHT, 11:00. I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS HIM GETTING THE TRASH. PUTTING TRASH OUT. YOU WERE HOME WHEN THIS HAPPENED? - I WAS IN THE LIVING ROOM. - OHH. SO, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE HAD ACTIVITY OR EXPERIENCED ACTIVITY FOR A LONG TIME. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THIS IS THE WORST IT'S EVER BEEN? ABSOLUTELY. - OKAY. - ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HER BEING SO KIND OF DISTRESSED IN THIS SITUATION? WELL, IT STRESSES ME OUT, 'CAUSE THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO. I CAN'T STOP IT. THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT IT. IT'S JUST LIKE -- IT -- IT HAPPENS. MM-HMM. WHEN YOU'RE AT A HOTEL AND THE LIGHTS COME ON DOWNSTAIRS, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO TO STOP IT. IT JUST HAPPENS. Berry: MM-HMM. I FEEL THAT CONTACTING YOU GUYS WAS MY LAST CHANCE OF TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN HERE. - OKAY. - OKAY. Berry: TOM AND TRACY ARE DEFINITELY EXPERIENCING ACTIVITY. IT'S FOCUSED ON TRACY. YOU CAN SEE TOM IS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT TRACY. THEY'RE HEARING VOICES. YOU KNOW, SHE'S HEARING FLUTE MUSIC. SHE ALSO HEARS GROWLING. HER HUSBAND HEARS GROWLING. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THIS ACTIVITY IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS ONE PERSON, THIS HAS BECOME A SITUATION THAT CAN GET OUT OF CONTROL. SO, TONIGHT, EVEN THOUGH TRACY'S HAVING EXPERIENCES IN OTHER PLACES, WE'RE DEFINITELY JUST -- YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON THE HOUSE. WE'RE GONNA SEND TOM AND TRACY AWAY FOR THE NIGHT. THAT WAY, WE CAN SEE IF THE ACTIVITY FOLLOWS THEM OR REMAINS HERE WITH US. - UM... - LET ME GET THIS LIGHT. YEAH, I WAS GONNA SAY TURN OUT THIS LIGHT. Berry: SO WE SET UP CAMERAS ALL OVER THE HOUSE TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T MISS ANYTHING. TONIGHT WE'LL START ON THE MASTER BEDROOM AND USE TRACY'S MOM'S NECKLACE AS A TRIGGER OBJECT. WE ATTACH THE PROXIMITY SENSOR TO IT, SO IF SOMETHING TOUCHES THE NECKLACE, THE ALARM WILL SOUND. ♪♪ [ BEEPING ] ♪♪ TO WHOEVER IS IN HERE WHO IS HERE ALL THE TIME, YOU PROBABLY NOTICED ADAM AND MYSELF. WE WERE INVITED HERE BY TRACY AND TOM BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO YOU ARE EXACTLY. IF THERE'S SOMEONE HERE WHO'S RELATED TO TRACY... [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] MAYBE, UM, BARBARA. DO YOU RECOGNIZE THOSE ITEMS THERE ON THAT TRAY? CAN YOU GIVE US SOME SORT OF SIGNAL THAT YOU'RE HERE? IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO US, YOU CAN TALK... HEY. DID YOU HEAR THAT? WAIT. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I HEARD A VOICE. - IN BETWEEN YOUR TALKING? - RIGHT. LIKE, YEAH. IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS COMING FROM IN HERE? IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS COMING FROM RIGHT OVER HERE. ♪♪ SO STRANGE. IT WAS VERY LOUD. [ CLICK ] I HEARD SOMETHING IN HERE. HELLO? IS THERE ANYBODY HERE THAT WANTS TO TALK TO US? ♪♪ Bruni: YOU SEEM TO HAVE FRIGHTENED TRACY PRETTY GOOD. DID YOU MEAN TO SCARE HER? SHE THINKS YOU MIGHT BE ANGRY WITH HER... BECAUSE SHE HEARS A GROWL. [ CLICKING ] - DO YOU HEAR THAT? - I HEAR THAT, TOO. - DO YOU HEAR -- IT WAS LIKE -- - IT'S -- IT'S STILL GOING. ♪♪ Berry: SHE THINKS YOU MIGHT BE ANGRY WITH HER... BECAUSE SHE HEARS A GROWL. [ CLICKING ] - DO YOU HEAR THAT? - I HEAR THAT, TOO. - DID YOU HEAR -- IT WAS LIKE -- - IT'S -- IT'S STILL GOING. RIGHT THERE. [ CLICKING ] THIS. ♪♪ I'M GONNA GO LOOK. DO YOU SEE ANYTHING? NO. [ CLICKING ] Bruni: THERE IT IS AGAIN. SOMETHING'S TAPPING ON THE WINDOW. [ CLICKING ] ♪♪ [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] [ SCRATCHING ] YOU SURE IT WAS THIS? NO. [ RATTLING ] WHAT ABOUT DOWN THERE? [ RATTLING ] THIS IS IT. [ CLICKING ] - THIS. - WAIT. STOP. [ CLICKING ] - IT'S YOUR SIDE. - YEAH, IT'S THIS SIDE. YEAH, I THINK IT'S THIS. SO, THE TAPPING WAS COMING FROM THIS SIDE? THIS SIDE? I THINK SO. IT WAS LIKE THIS... [ CLICKING ] - OKAY. - SO, LIKE -- WELL, SOMETHING'S TRYING TO GET OUR ATTENTION. YOU KEEP WATCHING, AND I'M GONNA GO LOOK AT THE DVR AND SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING GOING ON. OKAY. ♪♪ SO, WHOEVER IS HERE, I HEARD A TAPPING, AND WE THOUGHT WE HEARD A VOICE. SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE, THANK YOU. IT'S PROBABLY DIFFERENT FOR YOU TO HAVE SOMEONE HERE TALKING TO YOU LIKE THIS. [ DULL THUMP ] Berry: THERE'S ANOTHER KNOCK OVER HERE. [ DULL THUMP, THUMP ] THIS THING IS, LIKE, MISCHIEVOUS. ARE YOU GETTING ANYTHING ON THE RECORDER? LET ME CHECK. [ STATIC ] SO, WHO EVER IS HERE, I HEARD A TAPPING, AND WE THOUGHT WE HEARD VOICE. SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO COMMUNICATE, THANK YOU. IT'S PROBABLY DIFFERENT FOR YOU TO HAVE SOMEONE HERE TALKING TO YOU LIKE THIS. WAS THAT YOU? - THIS IS SO QUIET. - THESE AREN'T GETTING ANYTHING. - I'M GONNA... - NO. - ...PUT THEM BACK. - YEAH. BUT REALLY, LEGITIMATELY, TWICE SOMETHING WAS TAPPING, AND I HEARD A VOICE. - IT'S JUST MESSING WITH US. - MM-HMM. Bruni: WHOEVER'S HERE DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH TRACY'S MOM'S NECKLACE, BUT THERE'S CLEARLY SOMETHING HERE, AND IF TRACY AND TOM HAVE EXPERIENCED ACTIVITY OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, WHY DID IT CHOOSE TO STAY WITH US LAST NIGHT? DOES THAT MEAN THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY ACTIVITY AT THE HOTEL? I NEED TO SIT BACK DOWN WITH TRACY AND FIND OUT. I JUST WANTED TO JUST CHAT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EVERYTHING JUST KIND OF PRIVATELY AWAY FROM EVERYBODY. AND HOW WAS YOUR HOTEL LAST NIGHT? ANY ACTIVITY? - YES. - YEAH? FELT, LIKE, A VIBRATION IN THE BED. Bruni: THIS IS REALLY BIG. IF TRACY'S EXPERIENCING ACTIVITY AT HER HOTEL AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE EXPERIENCING ACTIVITY AT HER HOUSE, WE COULD BE DEALING WITH MORE THAN ONE ENTITY. OTHER THAN YOUR MOM, WAS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY WHO YOU LOST WHO YOU THINK COULD BE WITH YOU? - MY FATHER? - RIGHT. HIS NAME WAS LOUIS. - HE WAS 22 YEARS OLD. - MM-HMM. AND HE GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT, AND HE -- HE WAS SHOT. - MM. - AND THEN HE WAS GONE. - HOW OLD WERE YOU? - I WAS UNDER 2. - YEAH. - I WAS PROBABLY 15 MONTHS. - MM-HMM. - SO IT WAS REALLY HARD. YEAH. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MAN WHO SHOT HIM? WE HAVE NO IDEA. - REALLY? - YEAH. IT'S ALMOST LIKE JUSTICE WAS REALLY NEVER SERVED. NEVER SERVED. I DON'T FEEL IT WAS, HONESTLY. I THINK MY WHOLE LIFE, I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT HE WAS AROUND. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO INVESTIGATE WITH US TONIGHT? YES. HAVING MORE THAN ONE ENTITY HERE CHANGES EVERYTHING. ARE BOTH SPIRITS MEMBERS OF TRACY'S FAMILY, OR ARE THEY SOMEONE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT? HOPEFULLY BRINGING IN TRACY CAN HELP POINT US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ♪♪ WELL, SOMETIMES WE BRING PEOPLE IN WHEN THE CONNECTION WITH FAMILY IS REALLY STRONG. AND SO THAT'S WHY WE WANTED TO JUST TAKE THIS CHANCE TO BRING YOU IN AND DO A LITTLE INVESTIGATING AND SEE IF WE GET ANY RESPONSES. WE FIGURED WE'D GO INTO YOUR ROOM JUST BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE THE BULK OF YOUR EXPERIENCES. AND WE'LL TRY IN THERE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. Tracy: SOUNDS GOOD. - Berry: LET'S GRAB YOUR MOM'S NECKLACE. - [ BEEPING ] Bruni: THERE YOU GO. - THERE WE ARE. - GOOD. Bruni: ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA SET THIS UP HERE. SO, WHAT THAT IS, IS THAT'S A PROXIMITY SENSOR. IF SOMETHING REACHES OUT AND TOUCHES IT, THAT ALARM WILL SOUND. - OKAY. - SO WE WILL VACATE. WE'LL START THIS AND JUST LET YOU ASK SOME QUESTIONS WITHOUT US. Berry: THE REASON WHY WE WANT YOU TO DO IT ALONE IS BECAUSE SOMETIMES -- YOU KNOW, THEY MAY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO TALK TO US THROUGH THIS, BUT THEY MIGHT -- THERE'S THINGS THEY MIGHT WANT TO SAY JUST TO YOU BY YOURSELF AND WITHOUT US IN HERE. SO WE'RE GONNA GO. CAN I JUST LAY? BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN -- YEAH, YOU CAN LAY DOWN. I'M NOT SITTING IN HERE LIKE THIS WHEN I HEAR THINGS. - YEAH, GO AHEAD. - OKAY. HI, MOM. ARE YOU IN HERE TONIGHT? CAN YOU JUST TOUCH YOUR NECKLACE FOR ME? THAT WAY, THEY KNOW THAT IT'S YOU. IF THIS ISN'T MY MOM... ...IS THIS MY DAD? I NEVER GOT TO MEET YOU. SO IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO SAY... ...SAY IT RIGHT NOW. WE JUST GOT A TOUCH. YOU KNOW, THAT SCARES ME. WHO DID THAT? ♪♪ ♪♪ WE JUST GOT A TOUCH. DID SHE JUST GET TOUCHED? - I THINK SHE JUST GOT TOUCHED. - I THINK SHE JUST... Tracy: YOU KNOW, THAT SCARES ME. WHO DID THAT? SHE DEFINITELY GOT TOUCHED. OKAY, TRACY, WE'RE COMING BACK IN. [ BEEPING ] THAT'S US. Bruni: DID YOU GET TOUCHED? - YES. - I THOUGHT SO. - I SAW THAT. WE SAW THAT. - WE SAW IT ON THE CAMERA. IT WAS, LIKE, TOWARDS OVER HERE, WHICH IS THE NORMAL SPOT. Berry: WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE THINGS WORSE FOR TRACY, BUT THE FACT THAT SHE GOT TOUCHED IS A HUGE DEAL. IT'S RARE THAT WE GET TO SEE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AFFECT A CLIENT LIKE THAT IN REAL TIME. Bruni: WELL, LET'S LISTEN. [ STATIC ] - I MEAN... - WHAT'S IT SAYING? [ STATIC ] WHAT DO YOU HEAR? [ STATIC ] - I HEAR "FATHER." - YEAH, WE HEAR "FATHER," TOO. - SO, WE'RE HEARING "FATHER." - UH-HUH. Berry: HMM. WELL, HE'S RESPONDING. LET'S KEEP GOING AND SEE IF WE GET ANYTHING ELSE. Bruni: IS THERE A REASON THAT YOU'RE HERE? ARE YOU FOLLOWING TRACY? IF YOU KNOW ME, THEN WHY DO YOU TRY TO SCARE ME? - IT'S QUIET. - STRANGE. - I MEAN, WE HEARD "FATHER." - YES. YEAH. AND I'M SURE YOUR FATHER KNEW HE WASN'T GONNA MAKE IT AND WHAT THAT PROBABLY FELT LIKE, JUST LYING THERE KNOWING YOU WEREN'T GONNA SEE YOUR BABY GROW UP. THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO MAKE ME STICK AROUND, YOU KNOW? AND I'D WANT TO WATCH THAT BABY GROW UP. I DO KNOW THAT HE -- ONCE MY MOTHER GOT THE PHONE CALL... ...HE HUNG ON LONG ENOUGH UNTIL SHE GOT INTO THE ROOM. AND FROM WHAT SHE HAD TOLD ME, WAS THAT HE LOVED MY MOM, AND TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU TELL TRACY AND THAT I LOVE HER, TOO. - MM-HMM. YEAH. - MM. AND IT WAS LITERALLY... MY MOTHER SAID WITHIN 30 SECONDS, HE WAS GONE. - MM-HMM. - HMM. SHE FELT THAT LITERALLY HE HUNG ON TO SAY GOODBYE. Bruni: YEAH. WE HAVE SOME OTHER STUFF WE NEED TO INVESTIGATIVE, BUT WE JUST REALLY WANTED TO GET YOU IN HERE FOR THIS PRECISE REASON, BECAUSE WE KIND OF WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT YOUR FAMILY WAS HERE WITH YOU. - [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] - YEAH. SO... NOW TRACY KNOWS THAT ONE OF THE ENTITIES FOLLOWING HER IS SOMEONE SHE LOVES. BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE GOING ON HERE THAT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THE WORK OF A FAMILY MEMBER TO US. I SAW SOMEBODY DART ALONGSIDE THE HOUSE -- A LARGE STRIDE, VERY TALL. THE GROWLING. Bruni: DID IT SOUND LIKE AN ANIMAL, OR DID IT SOUND LIKE A PERSON GROWLING? Tom: IT ALWAYS SOUNDED LIKE A PERSON. Bruni: I'M HEADED TO THE LIBRARY TO DO SOME RESEARCH ON THE HOUSE AND SURROUNDING AREA WHILE ADAM TALKS TO TOM TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THEIR SIGHTING OF A MYSTERIOUS SHADOW FIGURE. WHAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT REALLY QUICKLY, JUST -- THE THING THAT HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT. IT WAS AT -- WHAT TIME WAS IT? 11:00? JUST ABOUT, YEAH. AND SO SHE WAS DRIVING IN THIS WAY AND SAW A SHADOW GO THAT WAY, RIGHT? APPARENTLY, SHE CALLED ME FROM THE END OF THE DRIVEWAY AND SAID, "TOM, I SAW SOMEBODY WALKING REALLY FAST THROUGH OUR YARD. CAN YOU COME OUT HERE? I'M NOT GETTING OUT OF THE CAR UNTIL YOU COME OUT." SHE JUST SAID HE WAS REALLY TALL. HE HAD REALLY LONG STRIDES. HE WAS WALKING REALLY FAST GOING THIS WAY. - WEIRD. - VERY WEIRD. LIKE, TALL MY HEIGHT, OR EVEN TALLER, YOU THINK? - SHE SAYS IT WAS TALLER. - REALLY? SHE SAID HE WAS REALLY TALL. SO, I'M 6'1". IT WAS A LITTLE BIT TALLER THAN YOU, THEN. SOMETHING, LIKE, ABNORMALLY TALL BUT BEGINS THERE AND RUNS THIS WAY. BEGINS THERE AND WALKS REALLY FAST THIS WAY. THE GATE'S CLOSED, SO HE WOULD'VE HAD TO OPEN THE GATE. SO HE'D HAVE TO OPEN THE GATE, WHICH IS NOT AN EASY THING TO DO. ...RUN THROUGH, TURN, CLOSE THE GATE... RIGHT, 'CAUSE THE GATE WAS CLOSED WHEN YOU CAME OUT. WHEN I CAME OUT, THE GATE WAS CLOSED. AND THEN WHERE WOULD HE GO? - I'M LIKE -- - OVER THE FENCE? BUT I WOULD HAVE HEARD SOMEBODY CLIMB OVER THE FENCE IF THEY WERE JUMPING OVER THE FENCE. HUH. YEAH. YEAH, YOU WOULD'VE HEARD -- [ LEAVES RUSTLE ] OH, GOD, YEAH. THE SHADOW FIGURE DARTING ON THE SIDE OF A HOUSE IS VERY INTERESTING. I MEAN, YES, IF SOMEONE WAS EXTREMELY ATHLETIC, THEY COULD JUMP TWO FENCES AND BE OUT OF SIGHT, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY COULD DO IT SO QUICKLY THAT TOM DIDN'T SEE THEM WHEN HE WENT TO THE BACKYARD TO LOOK. SO IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THAT THIS SHADOW FIGURE IS THE OTHER ENTITY WE'RE DEALING WITH. - HEY. - WHY ARE YOU MOVING THE CAMERA? WELL... I TALKED TO TOM TODAY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THE OTHER NIGHT. FROM THE WAY HE DESCRIBES IT, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A PERSON. SO I WANTED KIND OF TO MOVE IT OVER MORE INTO THE DIRECT LINE OF SIGHT. RIGHT. I THINK WE SHOULD INVESTIGATE OUR HERE TONIGHT. BUT WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT? SO, THIS HOUSE -- OBVIOUSLY BUILT 20 YEARS AGO. RIGHT. THIS LAND BEFOREHAND WAS ALL FARMS -- CATTLE FARMS AND FARMLAND. - OH. - NOTHING VERY INTERESTING. BUT BEFORE THAT, THERE WERE SEMINOLE INDIANS IN THE AREA, AND THE SEMINOLE TRIBE IS KNOWN FOR BEING VERY SPIRITUAL, AND THEY WERE ALSO FORCED OFF THIS LAND, SO IT'S POSSIBLE THEY'D STILL BE FIERCELY PROTECTIVE OF IT, EVEN IN THE AFTERLIFE. SO I'LL TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND GO A STEP FURTHER. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, WE CAN USE THEM TONIGHT WHEN WE INVESTIGATE. - GREAT. AWESOME. - SO... Berry: THE SHADOW FIGURE TRACY SAW IN THE BACKYARD PROBABLY ISN'T A FAMILY MEMBER, BECAUSE WHY WOULD A FAMILY MEMBER RUN AWAY FROM HER? WHATEVER'S HERE SEEMS TO BE ATTACHED TO THE LAND. IT COULD POSSIBLY BE NATIVE AMERICAN. YOU KNOW, THE SEMINOLE TRIBE HAD HISTORY HERE, SO IT'S A LEAD WE NEED TO PURSUE. HERE WE GO. WE'RE KICKING OFF TONIGHT'S INVESTIGATION IN THE BACKYARD WHERE THE APPARITION WAS SPOTTED, AND WE'RE GONNA USE THE SLS CAMERA WHICH DETECTS ANOMALIES THAT AREN'T VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE. IF IT PICKS UP ON SOMETHING, WE'LL SEE IT ON THE SCREEN. IS THIS YOUR LAND? DID SOMEONE FORCE YOU TO LEAVE? Berry: DO YOU... WANT THIS LAND BACK? ARE YOU HUNTING HERE? SHE HEARS A GROWL SOMETIMES. DO YOU HAVE A RASPY VOICE? ♪♪ ♪♪ SO, FOR THE TIME BEING, WHILE WE ARE INSIDE, COME IN WITH US. SIT DOWN WITH US. AND LET'S TALK ABOUT WHY YOU'RE HERE AND WHAT YOUR SITUATION IS. ♪♪ Berry: ARE YOU HUNTING HERE? "DO YOU WANT THIS LAND BACK?" "YES." [ LOUD STATIC ] - THAT WAS -- - WHAT WAS THAT? [ LOUD STATIC ] [ LOUD STATIC ] ♪♪ [ LOUD STATIC ] - THAT WAS -- - WHAT WAS THAT? ...SOMETHING. THAT WAS DEFINITELY SOMETHING. [ LOUD STATIC ] [ LOUD STATIC ] SOMETHING ABOUT -- WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE RASPY VOICE -- - IT WAS LIKE, "YEAH, YEAH." - "I DO" OR... [ LOUD STATIC ] IT IS A VERY RASPY, GROWLY VOICE. IT'S SO WEIRD. LET ME TRY TO LOOK UP SOMETHING REALLY QUICK-LIKE. MAYBE WE FINALLY GOT THAT CASE WHERE IT'S ACTUALLY A NATIVE AMERICAN. I MEAN, IT MAKES SENSE. BECAUSE THE WEIRD FLUTE THING... MM-HMM... - I HEAR FLUES. - MM-HMM. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT. SO, LISTEN TO THIS. THIS IS THE SEMINOLE FLUTE. [ FLUTE PLAYING ] UH... [ FLUTE CONTINUES ] AN ANOMALY JUST POPPED UP BEHIND US. REALLY? OH, WEIRD. IT'S, LIKE, UP THERE. THAT'S THE ACTIVE CORNER, REMEMBER? ALL THE ANIMALS WE'VE EVER HAD LOOK IN THAT CORNER LIKE THERE'S SOMEBODY THERE. [ FLUTE CONTINUES ] [ FLUTE MUSIC STOPS ] - WHERE'D IT GO? - WHERE'D IT GO? IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE. - IT LEFT? - MM-HMM. - WHEN I STOPPED THE MUSIC? - YEAH. IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE. IT'S GRAY. UM, WAIT TILL I READ THIS TO YOU. WHAT? "THE FLORIDA SEMINOLE AS THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES. PHYSIQUE OF THE MEN -- THE MEN, AS A RULE, ATTRACT ATTENTION BY THEIR HEIGHT OVER SIX FEET..." SHE SAID HE WAS REALLY TALL. SO, I'M 6'1"... IT'S A LITTLE BIT TALLER THAN YOU, THEN. HMM. THAT'D FIT THE DESCRIPTION. OVER SIX FEET. THAT'S SPECIFICALLY THE FLORIDA SEMINOLE NATIVE AMERICANS. NATIVE AMERICAN. WE'RE ON A PATH. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE IT LEADS. WE ARE GETTING CLUES. LET'S HEAD TO THE MASTER BEDROOM AND TRY THE FRANK'S BOX IN THERE. MM-HMM. WE SHOULD TRY AND MAYBE DO THE EXPERIMENT. YEAH. Bruni: FRANK'S BOX IS THE ORIGINAL SPIRIT BOX. FRANK SUMPTION DESIGNED THESE ORIGINALLY TO HEAR VOICES OF ALIENS, BUT HE STARTED HEARING OTHER VOICES COME OUT OF THEM, AND OTHER PEOPLE STARTED HEARING OTHER VOICES COME OUT OF THEM, AND THAT'S WHEN PARANORMAL INVESTIGATORS STARTED USING THEM. RAISE YOU'RE HAND WHEN YOU'RE READY. I'LL RAISE MY HAND. HERE WE GO. SO, I PUT ON A BLINDFOLD AND THE NOISE-CANCELING HEADPHONES, SO I'M NOT HEARING ANYTHING, I'M NOT SEEING ANYTHING. SO I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT QUESTIONS ADAM IS ASKING, AND I JUST SAY WHATEVER I THINK I HEAR. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? CAN YOU SAY YOUR NAME FOR US? [ WARBLED STATIC ] DOES ANYONE HERE KNOW TOM OR TRACY? [ WARBLED STATIC ] "MAYBE." ARE YOU RELATED TO THEM? [ WARBLED STATIC ] "I DON'T CARE." ♪♪ WERE YOU HERE BEFORE THE HOUSE WAS BUILT? [ WARBLED STATIC ] "CROW." ARE YOU SEMINOLE? "I AM." ♪♪ ARE YOU SEMINOLE? [ WARBLED STATIC ] "I AM." ♪♪ MM. OKAY. HOW WAS THAT? I MEAN... I ASKED "ARE YOU SEMINOLE?" AND YOU SAID, "I AM." - REALLY? - MM-HMM. LIKE, RIGHT AFTER. "ARE YOU SEMINOLE?" YOU SAID, "I AM." SO BIZARRE. I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE DIRECTION, BUT IT'S A DIRECTION THAT WE ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH. SO BASICALLY WE NEED TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHY IT'S HERE. MAYBE WE SHOULD TRY THE DAUGHTER'S ROOM NEXT. I MEAN, THE SHADOW HAS BEEN SEEN IN THERE, SO MAYBE WE'LL GET A BETTER RESPONSE. THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. Bruni: ALL THE EVIDENCE REINFORCES THAT THE SPIRIT WE'RE INTERACTING WITH IS SEMINOLE, BUT WE STILL NEED SOMETHING DEFINITIVE IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT A RESOLUTION. [ WARBLED STATIC ] ALL RIGHT. I'M GOOD. WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE PEACE WITH -- "WHO ARE YOU?" MY NAME IS ADAM. [ WARBLED STATIC ] WILL YOU ACCEPT -- "YOU'RE AMERICAN." YES. I'M SO SORRY FOR WHAT MY PEOPLE DID TO YOUR PEOPLE. THIS FAMILY ISN'T PART OF THAT. THE LAND WAS TAKEN LONG BEFORE THEY WERE HERE. [ WARBLED STATIC ] WILL YOU LEAVE THEM ALONE, PLEASE? "COME BACK." [ WARBLED STATIC ] HAVE YOU COME BACK HERE BECAUSE IT'S YOUR LAND? "GIVE." [ WARBLED STATIC ] - CAN WE MAKE PEACE? - "ALL RIGHT." [ WARBLED STATIC ] "PRAY." SHOULD WE PRAY FOR YOU? HOW SHOULD WE PRAY? [ WARBLED STATIC ] "PRAY. PRAY." [ WARBLED STATIC STOPS ] [ Sighing ] OH, GOD. UM, WELL, OKAY, SO, I THINK I KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO, BECAUSE I SAID -- I SAID, "CAN WE MAKE PEACE?" AND YOU SAID, "ALL RIGHT." AND THEN YOU KEPT SAYING, "PRAY," SO I THINK WE SHOULD PRAY. WELL, I THINK WE NEED TO JUST CALL IN SOMEONE, BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE OUT OF OUR ELEMENT HERE BIG-TIME. I DON'T WANT TO STIR THIS UP ANY MORE 'CAUSE THIS IS NOT OUR AREA OF EXPERTISE. Bruni: WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO A RESOLUTION, BUT WE CAN'T BE SURE WITHOUT CONSULTING AN EXPERT. WE NEED TO SHOW TRACY AND TOM WHAT WE'VE DISCOVERED. WE'LL TELL THEM OUR PLAN TO BRING IN OUTSIDE HELP AND HOPEFULLY END THEIR SUFFERING FOR GOOD. I THINK THAT YOU BEING HERE THE OTHER NIGHT AND HEARING FROM YOUR FAMILY ALREADY CONFIRMED SOME THINGS FOR YOU, RIGHT? YES, THEY DID. BUT THERE WERE SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WERE BOTHERING YOU -- THE GROWLING AND THE FLUTE PLAYING. AND WE THINK WE'VE COME UP WITH A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION. WE THINK IT MIGHT BE A NATIVE AMERICAN SPIRIT. SO I'LL SHOW YOU THIS CLIP. IT'S AN SLS CAMERA, WHICH STANDS FOR "STRUCTURED LIGHT SENSOR," WHICH MEANS THAT IT DETECTS A PERSON AND KIND OF MAPS OUT THEIR FEATURES. - OKAY. - AND SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS HE HAD THE CAMERA FACING THAT DIRECTION, AND WE STARTED PLAYING THE SEMINOLE FLUTE MUSIC, AND THIS ANOMALY APPEARED IN THE UPPER CORNER OF YOUR ROOM. [ FLUTE PLAYING ] Berry: SEE? AND YOU CAN HEAR THE MUSIC. MM-HMM. OH, MY GOSH. [ GASPS ] [ FLUTE PLAYING ] Bruni: BUT THEN WE STOPPED THE MUSIC... AND IT GOES AWAY. - ...AND IT DIS-- - OHH! SO, YEAH, IT WAS RIGHT IN THE ACTIVE CORNER, AND I DON'T KNOW WHY IT APPEARED RIGHT THERE, BUT IT HAPPENED ONLY WHEN WE PLAYED THAT MUSIC. SO THEN WE DID SOMETHING THAT WE CALL THE SPIRIT BOX EXPERIMENT. WE ALSO RECORDED THIS IN YOUR DAUGHTER'S ROOM. MY PERSONAL OPINION -- AND MAYBE AMY WILL AGREE -- IT'S LIKE, "PRAY," AND I'M THINKING, "WELL, WHAT PRAYER?" LIKE, I DON'T -- "WHAT PRAYER DO YOU NEED? 'CAUSE I ONLY KNOW A CERTAIN -- I ONLY KNOW ENGLISH, I DON'T KNOW YOUR PRAYERS." AND THEN SHE SAYS, "PRAY," AGAIN, SO IT'S LIKE -- IT'S LIKE IT WANTS A SPECIFIC BLESSING OR PRAYER, IN MY OPINION. AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND, WE CALLED SOMEONE HERE TODAY TO COME DO A NATIVE AMERICAN BLESSING BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE THAT'S WHAT THE SPIRIT WANTS. ♪♪ [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] THIS IS PETER. PETER, THIS IS TOM AND TRACY. Peter: HI, TOM. NICE TO MEET YOU. - MY WIFE, TRACY. - HI, PETER. HELLO, TRACY. NICE TO MEET YOU. Bruni: PETER IS A NATIVE AMERICAN PASTOR AND MEDICINE MAN, AND HE WORKS VERY CLOSELY WITH THE SEMINOLE TRIBE LOCALLY AND IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THEIR CUSTOMS AND BACKGROUNDS. SO, USUALLY WHAT I DO IS I COME INTO HOMES, AND I'LL SPEAK TO THE SPIRIT. I'M A MEDIUM, SO WE'LL FIND OUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO FREE THEM AND TO ALSO GIVE THE BOTH OF YOU SOME COMFORT IN YOUR OWN HOME. SO, I USE THIS ROD, AND IT'S A DOWSING ROD. I'VE LEARNED TO FIND WHERE THESE PORTALS ARE, THE OPENINGS IN THE HOMES, TO DISCOVER, YOU KNOW, WHERE THEY'RE COMING IN AND OUT OF. SO THINK OF A PORTAL AS LIKE A DOORWAY OR A ROAD THAT THEY TRAVEL DOWN. SO I'LL JUST KIND OF WALK AROUND THE HOUSE AND SEE WHERE IT'S GOING TO. SO FAR, SO GOOD. OH, IT LIKES THIS CHAIR. WHO SITS IN THIS CHAIR? - SHE DOES. - ME. OKAY. ♪♪ SO I'LL JUST KIND OF WALK AROUND THE HOUSE AND SEE WHERE IT'S GOING TO. SO FAR, SO GOOD. OH, IT LIKES THIS CHAIR. WHO SITS IN THIS CHAIR? - SHE DOES. - ME. OKAY. YEAH, DEFINITELY. SO, BASICALLY WHAT I'LL DO IS CLOSE THIS PORTAL. FIRST I WANT TO SEE WHO'S HERE. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] THERE'S DEFINITELY A MALE-TYPE WARRIOR HERE. Bruni: ADAM AND I ARE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER BECAUSE HE IS COMMUNICATING WITH SOMEONE WHO MIGHT BE NATIVE AMERICAN, SO INSTANTLY AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW WE HAD MADE THE RIGHT DECISION BRINGING HIM HERE. OKAY, SO, BASICALLY I USED MY ENERGY, I CALL UPON THE NATIVE AMERICAN TOTEM, THE RAVEN, TO DESCEND INTO THE UNDERWORLD AND BRING LIGHT TO THE DARKNESS. BLESS THIS AREA. I CLOSE IT, BIND IT, CAP IT, SEAL IT. AND AHO. AHO IS NATIVE AMERICAN. IT MEANS "LET IT BE SO." LET'S SEE. I'M GONNA LOOK AROUND AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER SPOTS WHERE THEY MOVE IN AND OUT. [ MUTTERING ] I FEEL IT RIGHT HERE, AS WELL. THERE'S ANOTHER SPOT HERE. WE CAP IT, CLOSE IT, AND IF -- THE SPIRITS THAT ARE HERE, WE MEAN YOU NO HARM. WE BRING YOU LOVE AND LIGHT. WE'D LIKE TO CROSS YOU OVER SO YOU MAY CONTINUE YOUR JOURNEY. AND AHO. THERE YOU GO. NOTHING ANYMORE. HAVE YOU EVER HAD ACTIVITY AROUND THIS AREA? - YES? - YES. YEAH? OKAY. GREAT. Berry: AMY AND I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN PASSING SPIRITS ON, ESPECIALLY THROUGH A PORTAL, BUT PETER HAS BEEN SO SPOT ON ABOUT WHERE THE ACTIVITY HAPPENS THAT WE'RE WILLING TO FOLLOW HIS LEAD. Peter: GOOD. GOOD. EVERYTHING ELSE FEELS PRETTY GOOD, SO THE LAST THING WE WOULD DO IS BLESS THE HOME. I DO HERE A NATIVE AMERICAN FLUTE PLAYING IN MY MIND. DO THEY USE A FLUTE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? - MM-HMM. - OKAY. Berry: THIS IS ACTUALLY REALLY INSANE. WE DIDN'T GIVE PETER ANY INFORMATION, AND HE TOOK US TO EVERY, SINGLE SPOT IN THE HOUSE WHERE ACTIVITY OCCURRED. WE MEAN YOU NO HARM, MY FRIEND. IF WE'VE OFFENDED YOU IN ANY WAY, WE ASK FORGIVENESS FOR OUR IGNORANCE. MAY THIS LAND BECOME BLESSED AND PURE ONCE AGAIN. THESE PEOPLE HAVE NOT MEANT ANY HARM TO YOU WHATSOEVER. THIS IS THEIR HOME, AS WELL. AND IF WE COULD ALL JOIN HANDS, THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN A PORTAL, OKAY? LIKE A TUNNEL. AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THIS HOME, EVERYTHING'S CREATED WITH HUMAN IMAGINATION -- ALL THE DRAPERY AND THE WALLS. ALL THE CONTENTS IS CREATED WITH HUMAN IMAGINATION, RIGHT? Tom: MM-HMM. SO WE WOULD CREATE THE SAME IN THE SUPERNATURAL REALM. WE WOULD USE OUR IMAGINATION TO CREATE A SPACE FOR THEM TO CROSS THROUGH, OKAY? SO, I'D LIKE YOU TO IMAGINE A TUNNEL. AND WE'RE GONNA OPEN THIS TUNNEL OF LIGHT, AND WE'RE GONNA ASK THE ANCESTORS TO COME THROUGH THE TUNNEL... ...TO CROSS OVER ANY SPIRITS THAT ARE IN TURMOIL OR IN PAIN. AND IMAGINE THIS TUNNEL OF LIGHT, AND I IMAGINE THIS BAND OF NATIVE AMERICAN INDIANS. I SEE THEM. MAY YOU MOVE THROUGH THE TUNNEL. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] AND WITH MY SACRED BREATH, I MAKE IT SO. AND AHO. MAY THEY BE WELL ON THEIR JOURNEY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING TODAY. - YOU'RE VERY, VERY WELCOME. - WE APPRECIATE IT. - IT WAS MY PLEASURE. - THANK YOU. I WISH YOU BOTH VERY WELL. THANK YOU, TOM. Tom: THANK YOU, PETER. Bruni: WE FOUND THAT ONCE YOU GIVE A SPIRIT THE RECOGNITION IT DESERVES, IT USUALLY ALLOWS THEM TO MOVE ON. THIS CASE WAS DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE WERE DEALING WITH AN UNFAMILIAR CULTURE. THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT IN AN EXPERT WHO COULD RESPECTFULLY ADDRESS THE SPIRIT. THANK YOU SO MUCH, YOU GUYS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. Bruni: TOM, IT WAS SO NICE TO MEET YOU. - THANK YOU. - NICE MEETING YOU, TOO. Bruni: NOW TRACY KNOWS THAT THE SPIRIT WHO FOLLOWS HER IS NOT MENACING. IT'S HER FATHER WATCHING OVER HER. SHE CAN TAKE GREAT COMFORT IN THAT.
