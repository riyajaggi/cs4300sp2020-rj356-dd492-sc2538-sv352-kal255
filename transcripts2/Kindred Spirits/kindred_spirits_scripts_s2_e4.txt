Bruni: OKAY. SO, THEY BOUGHT THE HOUSE FIVE YEARS AGO, AND THE ACTIVITY IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. REALLY? YEAH. LISTEN TO THIS. THIS IS HIS VOICEMAIL. YOU CAN HEAR IT IN HIS VOICE. ♪♪ ♪♪ THIS JUST HAPPENED -- THE STOVE THING. THAT'S EXTREMELY DANGEROUS, BUT THE FREAKIEST THING THAT HE TOLD ME WAS THAT HE WAS WORKING ON CHAIRS THAT HE HAD JUST BOUGHT. RIGHT. AND THEY WERE ON THE TABLE BUTT-SIDE DOWN, WITH THE LEGS UP, AND NEXT TO HIM, THIS CHAIR LIFTS US A LITTLE BIT, FLOATS OUT, FLIPS UP LIKE THIS, AND THEN SITS RIGHT BACK DOWN. AND THAT IS HONESTLY THE CRAZIEST CLAIM THAT I'VE EVER HEARD IN TERMS OF AN OBJECT MOVING IN FRONT OF SOMEONE WHO IS HAVING PARANORMAL ACTIVITY IN THEIR HOUSE. WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE WHATEVER'S THERE IS FRANTICALLY TRYING TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THEM OR LET THEM KNOW THAT IT'S THERE. RIGHT. HE'S WORRIED, YOU KNOW -- HE'S WORRIED THAT IT'S GONNA PICK UP. HE'S WORRIED THAT THE ACTIVITY'S GONNA KEEP GOING. I CAN SEE WHY THAT WOULD BE ALARMING. YEAH. SO WE HAVE TO HELP THEM. YEAH. ♪♪ Berry: IT SOUNDS LIKE CARL AND CINDY DEAL WITH ACTIVITY EVERY DAY. BUT NOW, WHATEVER'S CAUSING THE DISTURBANCE IS GETTING WORSE. THE ACTIVITY IS ACTUALLY FRIGHTENING THEM. THE SCARY PART -- THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW IF THE INTENTION IS POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE. BUT THE STOVETOP TURNING ON AND OFF COULD BE DANGEROUS. AND THEY DON'T WANT THE ACTIVITY TO PICK UP, SO THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE HERE. LET'S START FROM THE BEGINNING, AND YOU JUST TELL US EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON. AFTER WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE -- WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE ABOUT 2012, AND THERE WAS SOMEBODY WHO HAD BEEN LIVING HERE AND WAS REALLY A MESS, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. Bruni: MM-HMM. AND I TORE EVERYTHING OUT. IS THAT ABOUT WHEN THE ACTIVITY STARTED? YEP. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S SURE OF ME. OKAY. I THINK IT LIKES CARL BETTER. OKAY, AND WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT? IT'S MORE AROUND HIM THAN IT IS FOR ME. MM-HMM. OKAY. ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY HAPPENING IN THIS SPACE? YES. MM-HMM. I WAS LYING ON THE COUCH, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, SOMEBODY SAID, "CARL, HI. I'M HERE." Bruni: THE VOICE -- IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS FAMILIAR WITH YOU? OR... I MEAN, IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS COMFORTABLE, OR... IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS COMFORTABLE BEING HERE. OKAY. AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, I'LL HEAR, LIKE, MUSIC. YOU HEAR THE MUSIC REGULARLY, OR... YES. DOES IT SOUND LIKE IT HAS A FILTER IN BETWEEN YOU AND ITSELF, OR IS IT CLEAR? - IT'S NOT CLEAR. - OKAY. Cindy: BUT YOU DEFINITELY KNOW IT'S MUSIC. OKAY. AND IT'S BEEN AMPING UP. WE'VE HAD KNOCKING, WE'VE HAD... FOOTSTEPS. TOUCHING. WHERE IN THE HOUSE DOES THE TOUCHING HAPPEN? UPSTAIRS. OKAY. ♪♪ Cindy: THE TOUCHING HAPPENS UP HERE. THE KNOCKING HAPPENS UP HERE. THE SOUNDS -- THE BOOMS -- THEY'RE ALWAYS AT A -- STRONG. WHAT DOES IT SOUND LIKE, EXACTLY? IT SOUNDS LIKE, SAY, - SOMEONE RUNNING AGAINST THE DOOR. - MM-HMM. LIKE THE THUD. AND THEN THE KNOCKING IS DIFFERENT. Berry: IT'S JUST DEFINITE KNOCKS? IT'S DEFINITE KNOCKS. WHERE IN THIS -- WHERE? IT'S COME OUT OF THIS ROOM. THIS IS OUR DRESSING ROOM. OUT OF THE CLOSET. IN THE CLOSET, THE KNOCKS? - Cindy: YES. - YEAH. OKAY. LIKE... [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] RIGHT, YEAH. AND IT WAS ON THE ACTUAL DOOR HERE? Bruni: AND THAT ONLY HAPPENED THAT ONE TIME? Cindy: NO, ABOUT THREE TIMES THAT HAS HAPPENED. [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] Berry: LIKE THAT? YES, JUST LIKE THAT. ♪♪ THIS WAS THE WORKSHOP, AND IT WAS PROBABLY LIKE RIGHT ABOUT HERE WHERE THAT CHAIR WAS. AND I WAS STANDING ABOUT HERE, AND THAT'S WHEN IT JUST SLID OUT AND TURNED RIGHT-SIDE-UP AND THEN CAME DOWN TO THE FLOOR. AND IT DIDN'T EVEN SLAM -- WHICH I CAN'T UNDERSTAND. SO, SOMEONE, LIKE, SET IT DOWN ALMOST? LIKE THEY SET IT DOWN, RIGHT. ALMOST AS IF THEY WERE PULLING OUT A CHAIR AT A DINING-ROOM TABLE AND SITTING DOWN -- THEY'RE GONNA TALK TO ME OR SOMETHING. OKAY. SO, THIS WAS WHAT TIME OF THE DAY? IT WAS AT NIGHT. IT WAS AT NIGHT. AND HOW SOON AFTER YOU MOVED IN DID THAT HAPPEN? IT WASN'T THAT LONG. YEP. HMM. Berry: ANY IDEA WHO YOU MIGHT THINK IT IS? Bruni: MM-HMM. Carl: I REALLY DON'T KNOW. I KNOW WHEN MY GRANDMOTHER HAD DIED, WE WERE VERY, VERY CLOSE. WHAT WAS YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S NAME, REALLY QUICK? MY GRANDMOTHER'S NAME WAS HELEN. OKAY. Bruni: SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL QUITE RIGHT. WE KNOW FROM PAST CASES THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE MOST LIKELY SUSPECT, AND IF IT WAS A LOVING FAMILY MEMBER, WHY WOULD CARL AND CINDY FEEL SO THREATENED BY IT? I NEED TO SIT DOWN WITH CINDY AND SEE IF THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE AT PLAY HERE. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO HAVE THIS THING THAT'S HERE WITH YOU? INTIMIDATING. IT'S LIKE AN INVASION. RIGHT. VERY, LIKE, VERY MUCH SO. HAS THERE EVER BEEN ANYTHING THAT YOU FELT ESPECIALLY AFRAID OF? UPSTAIRS, I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE SOMEONE'S STANDING NEXT TO ME, WATCHING ME. AND WHATEVER IT IS ALWAYS TOUCHES ME ON MY RIGHT ARM. MM-HMM. WHEN ALL THE ACTIVITY REALLY STARTED RAMPING UP, I GOT MORE WORRIED ABOUT WALKING UPSTAIRS OR WALKING DOWNSTAIRS. HOW MUCH FURTHER WAS IT GONNA GO? THAT'S WHAT REALLY MADE ME AFRAID. RIGHT. YOUR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY AT THAT POINT. YEAH, FOR ME. YES. IS THERE ANYBODY THAT YOU CAN THINK OF THAT MAYBE YOU HAVE LOST OR BEEN CONNECTED TO OVER THE YEARS? THE ONLY ONE I CAN THINK OF IS MY GRANDMOTHER. WHEN SHE PASSED AWAY, NOBODY KNEW THAT SHE WAS ILL, AND NONE OF US KIDS GOT TO GO TO SEE HER. HER NAME WAS MARY. ALL RIGHT. DO YOU THINK IT'S SOMETHING OR SOMEONE THAT KNEW CARL OR DO YOU THINK IT CAME WITH THE HOUSE? IF I HAD TO GUESS IF IT WAS ONE PERSON, IT WOULD BE HIS GRANDMOTHER. DOES IT EVER MAKE YOU WORRY FOR HIM? I DO, BUT I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING. YEAH. BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HIM TO KNOW HOW MUCH I WORRY. ♪♪ ♪♪ Bruni: CINDY'S WATCHED OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS AS THIS ACTIVITY HAS ESCALATED. THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP IS THAT THIS THING GETS PHYSICAL. SHE SAID SHE'S AFRAID SOMETHING'S GONNA PUSH THEM DOWN THE STAIRS, AND THAT'S KIND OF HER WORST NIGHTMARE. Bruni: DO YOU WANT TO START UPSTAIRS? Berry: YEAH, LET'S DO THAT. IN THE BEDROOM? OR... I THINK THAT'S THE MOST LOGICAL PLACE. THAT'S WHERE CINDY FEELS LIKE SHE GETS TOUCHED THE MOST -- UP THERE. DO YOU THINK THAT FREAKS HER OUT MORE THAN SHE'S LETTING ON? SHE SAYS SHE WORRIES THAT BECAUSE IT'S ESCALATED OVER THE YEARS, LIKE SINCE THEY GOT HERE, SHE'S AFRAID THE NEXT STEP WILL BE AT, LIKE, ACTUALLY HARMING THEM. ♪♪ WHATEVER'S HERE SEEMS VERY PHYSICAL. WE HOPE IT WILL USE THAT ENERGY TO REACH OUT. SINCE WE DON'T KNOW HOW IT WILL COMMUNICATE, WE'LL USE A RECORDER TO CAPTURE ANY ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENA AND A K II METER TO DETECT ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS GENERATED WHEN A SPIRIT COULD BE PRESENT. OKAY, I WOULD LIKE TO START DOING EVP WORK. - HEY, UH, ADAM? - YES? THE K-II METER IS GOING OFF. ♪♪ Bruni: HELLO, IS SOMEONE IN HERE? CAN YOU MAKE THIS GO ALL THE WAY UP TO RED? ♪♪ YOU CAN LET IT GO.

I'M GONNA PUT A CHAIR ON THAT TABLE, AND WE'RE GONNA MONITOR IT AND SEE IF WE CAN CATCH ANYTHING. ♪♪ WHAT DID YOU COME ACROSS? WELL, THE MAN WHO LIVED IN THIS HOUSE BEFORE CARL AND CINDY WAS NAMED JIM. HE DIED OF CANCER IN 2010. HE WAS 58. BASICALLY, WHAT HAPPENED WAS THIS HOUSE ORIGINALLY -- IN 1930-- A GROUP OF PEOPLE, THEY WERE PROBABLY RELATED, THEY BOUGHT THIS PLOT. THE PREVIOUS OWNER JIM -- THAT WAS HIS FAMILY. IT HAS BEEN IN HIS FAMILY SINCE 1930. TWO OF THE WOMEN WHO ORIGINALLY BUILT THE HOUSE AND WERE IN THIS ORIGINAL GROUP OF PEOPLE -- ONE WAS NAMED MARY, AND ONE WAS NAMED MARIE. - Berry: IN THIS HOUSE? - IN THIS HOUSE. OUR CLIENTS ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT LIVED HERE THAT WERE NOT RELATIVES OF JIM. THAT COULD BE WHY THE ACTIVITY STARTED WHEN THEY MOVED IN. LET'S FOCUS ON FIGURING OUT WHICH MARY IS HERE.

SO WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO MARY WAS, AND WE BROUGHT IN ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS. Bruni: STEPHANIE IS -- I CONSIDER TO BE A VERY GIFTED PSYCHIC. AND SHE DID A WALK-THROUGH OF YOUR HOUSE. AND IMMEDIATELY, SHE WALKED IN, AND SHE SAID THERE WAS A MAN HERE. I SAW A MAN STANDING IN THAT BACK CORNER. HE COMES UP, HE DOES HIS THING, IS WHAT HE SAYS. LIKE, "SOMETIMES, I BUMP INTO THINGS." AND SHE WAS ABLE TO EXACTLY DESCRIBE THE FORMER HOMEOWNER JIM. THAT'S COOL. SO, YEAH. WE THINK, LIKE, MOST OF YOUR ACTIVITY IS ATTRIBUTED PROBABLY TO JIM. WE THINK HE'S THE ONE THAT'S MOVING THINGS AROUND. - MAYBE ACCIDENTLY HITTING THE BED AS HE GOES BY, LIKE... - YES. Cindy: AH! WHICH ALSO COULD EXPLAIN THE STOVE. HE'S BUMPING INTO THINGS -- MOVING THEM. BUT THAT HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HE'S DOING IT. IF YOU EXPERIENCE SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, SAY OUT LOUD -- JUST LET HIM KNOW WHAT HIS -- WHAT THE BOUNDARIES ARE, 'CAUSE HE MAY NOT REALIZE IT. Cindy: THAT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD. Carl: YEAH. BUT I THINK NOW THAT YOU KNOW THE MOTIVATION AND NOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHO IS BEHIND IT, IT KIND OF PUTS IT INTO A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. YEAH. AND THERE'S NO MALICE BEHIND IT. NONE. AND ALONG THOSE LINES, WE DON'T THINK YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT AS FAR AS IT ESCALATING TO SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS. SO WE BROUGHT STEPHANIE HERE WITH US TODAY. WE WERE HOPING WE COULD JUST KIND OF ALL OF US GET TOGETHER, AND SHE'LL KIND OF BE THE GO-BETWEEN. ♪♪ Bruni: CARL AND CINDY ACCEPT THE FORMER HOMEOWNER JIM JUST WANTS TO STAY IN THE HOME WHERE HE GREW UP. WELCOMING JIM AND ESTABLISHING CLEAR BOUNDARIES SHOULD CUT DOWN ON THE ACTIVITY THAT BOTHERED THEM. HE HAD SAID THAT IT WASN'T NECESSARILY A FAMILY CONNECTION, BUT HE CONSIDERED YOU GUYS FAMILY. BEAUTIFUL. - OH, THAT'LL WORK. - Berry: YEAH. Bruni: I LOVE SEEING THE SHIFT TO JUST FULLY ACCEPTING IT. Carl: MM-HMM. YEAH. AND REALIZING THE MOTIVATION. - I FEEL PEACEFUL. - I -- YEAH. I DO. I HAVEN'T REALLY FELT LIKE THIS IN A LONG TIME. IT IS A DIFFERENT FEELING. Bruni: WE CONNECTED WITH CARL'S AUNT MARY. KNOWING SHE'S HERE TO WATCH OVER HIM GAVE HIM PEACE. NOTHING IN THIS HOUSE IS AGGRESSIVE OR NEGATIVE, AND CARL AND CINDY CAN FINALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THEIR OWN HOME. ♪♪
