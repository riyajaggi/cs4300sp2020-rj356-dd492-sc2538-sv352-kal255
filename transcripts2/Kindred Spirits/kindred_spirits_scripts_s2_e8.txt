 I WAS FEELING SOME ENERGY UPSTAIRS. THERE'S A GUY SITTING IN THE CORNER DRINKING WHISKEY. HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. THE BACK OF THE BOOKSHELF BURST INTO FLAMES. A PARANORMAL FIRE? WE'VE BEEN LITERALLY SLEEPING IN SHIFTS. SORRY. WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? I'M AMY BRUNI. I WAS ONLY 8 WHEN A PARANORMAL INCIDENT CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER.

 FROM PREVIOUS HOMES IN FLORIDA AND GEORGIA. THEY CAN'T ESCAPE IT. THEY ALSO HAPPEN TO LIVE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM A CEMETERY. - I ASSUME THAT'S THE HOUSE. - THAT'S THE HOUSE, RIGHT THERE. PROBABLY THE MOST FRIGHTENING THING THAT'S HAPPENED IS THEY HAVE HAD A FIRE START IN THE HOUSE. A PARANORMAL FIRE? THEY CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW IT STARTED. THEY ARE FREAKED OUT. LIKE, LIKE THEY ARE LEGITIMATELY SCARED. THEY'RE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THEIR DAUGHTER GILLIAN. SHE'S SEEING APPARITIONS IN HER ROOM. SHE'S HAVING A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH IT. SHE'S NOT SLEEPING. SHE'S SUFFERING BECAUSE OF THIS. YEAH. WITH EVERYTHING GILLIAN IS GOING THROUGH, YOU CAN'T HAVE A MORE IMPORTANT CASE THAN THIS ONE. THE URGENCY IS THERE. YOU WANT TO HEAD OF THERE, AND -- - YEAH. - OKAY. LET'S GO. WHAT'S GOING ON? WE'VE HAD ACTIVITY THAT'S BEEN KIND OF FOLLOWING US AROUND THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, AND A LOT OF IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DAUGHTER GILLIAN. AND WHERE DID YOU LIVE BEFORE? GEORGIA FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS, FLORIDA FOR ABOUT A YEAR, AND THEN UP HERE SINCE JUNE. NOW HOW SOON AFTER MOVING HERE DID YOU REALIZE THAT IT HAD FOLLOWED YOU? MAYBE ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS? BUT SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE, THERE'S BEEN OTHER ACTIVITY THAT HASN'T BEEN NORMAL FOR WHAT WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH. - SEEMS IT'S ESCALATING. - ESCALATING. - RIGHT. - A SCARY LEVEL. MORE OF A VIOLENT OR AGGRESSIVE NATURE TO IT. WE HAD A FIRE IN MY OFFICE. ALONG THAT WALL, RIGHT THERE, THERE WAS A STAND-UP BOOKSHELF, JUST LIKE THE OTHER ONE IN THE CORNER, SO WE HAD THESE LITTLE TEA CANDLES, AND WE HAD TWO THAT WERE ON MY BOOKSHELF ON THE SECOND LEVEL UP, AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY THREE GOALIE MASKS THAT WERE ON THERE. IT WAS ABOUT 9:00 P.M., AND THEN KELLEY HEARD, LIKE, A CRACK AND A POP NOISE. THE BACK OF THE BOOKSHELF BURST INTO FLAMES. STILL HAVE NO IDEA HOW IT HAPPENED. THEY WERE JUST TWO LITTLE TEA CANDLES, AND HOW HOT DO THEY BURN? RIGHT. IT WASN'T AS IF THE MASKS WERE ON FIRE OR ABOVE IT. IT WAS THE BACK OF THE BOOKSHELF THAT HAD CAUGHT FIRE. OKAY. I LET THOSE BURN OUT ALL THE TIME IN MY HOUSE. - YEAH, ME TOO. - YEAH. I'VE NEVER EVEN THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT IT. - RIGHT. - YEAH. YEAH, BECAUSE THEY'RE TINY LITTLE -- DID YOU TAKE PHOTOS OR ANYTHING? - YES. YES. - OKAY. IF YOU COULD SEND THOSE TO US, THAT WOULD BE AWESOME. - RIGHT. - DEFINITELY. I HAVE A FIREMAN FRIEND I'M GOING TO ASK ABOUT IT AND SEE WHAT HE THINKS. SO YOU MUST HAVE BEEN TOTALLY FREAKED OUT HAVING A FIRE IN THE HOUSE. YOUR FIRST CONCERN IS OBVIOUSLY THE SAFETY OF EVERYBODY. - YEAH. I KNOW. - IT'S OKAY. - THAT'S SCARY THOUGH. - I'M SORRY. - NO. - IT'S FRIGHTENING. BUT YOU CAUGHT IT IN TIME. - CAUGHT IT IN TIME. - THANKFULLY. - SORRY. - NO, YOU'RE FINE. IT'S A LOT, AND THEN NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY WORRIED LIKE, "IS THAT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN?" YEAH. NOW WE'RE NOT SLEEPING. WE'VE BEEN LITERALLY SLEEPING IN SHIFTS, AND IT'S JUST BEEN EXHAUSTING AND TERRIFYING. IF COULD EXPLAIN TO YOU EXACTLY HOW THAT HAPPENED, IS THAT GOING TO -- THAT WOULD BE IMMENSELY HELPFUL. I HAVE SEEN, IN MY LIFE AND IN PAST CASES, WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN UNEXPLAINED FIRES STARTED. IT'S VERY RARE, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN REPORTED BEFORE. WHEN ME AND KELLEY HAD REGROUPED TO THE KITCHEN OVER FROM BEHIND US, WHERE THE OUTSIDE DOOR IS, THERE WERE FOUR REALLY LOUD, AGGRESSIVE BANGS. IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY WAS BANGING ON YOUR DOOR. I THOUGHT INITIALLY THAT IT WAS, LIKE, A NEIGHBOR RUNNING BECAUSE THEY SAW FIRE, YOU KNOW? POUNDING TO MAKE SURE WE'RE OKAY. AND TURNED -- NOBODY. - NOBODY THERE? - THREE FEET OF SNOW, AND WE HAVE TWO MOTION SENSOR LIGHTS IN THE BACK. THERE WAS NO FOOTPRINTS, NO SIGN OF DISTURBANCE. THE LIGHTS DIDN'T GO OFF. THE LIGHTS DIDN'T GO OFF OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THAT'S SO WEIRD. IN HERE WE HAVE BOTH EXPERIENCED CONVERSATIONS. LIKE, I'LL BE LYING IN BED, AND IT WILL SOUND LIKE THERE IS TWO PEOPLE STANDING AT THE FOOT OF MY BED SAYING SOMETHING. YOU CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING, REALLY, BUT YOU KNOW THAT A CONVERSATION IS TAKING PLACE. I ALMOST FEEL LIKE IT'S A MAN AND A WOMAN. DO YOU HEAR IT ANYWHERE ELSE? - NO. - NO. - JUST IN THIS ROOM. - JUST IN THIS ROOM. SO THIS IS GILLIAN'S ROOM, YEAH? YES. ALL RIGHT. AND SHE'S HAD EXPERIENCES IN HERE? YES, SHE CAN DESCRIBE IT BEST, OBVIOUSLY, BUT SHE SEES A MAN, SHADOW MAN, AND SHE'S HAD TAPPING AT THE WINDOW. HAD ANYBODY ELSE SEEN THESE APPARITIONS? - NO. - SO JUST HER? YES. AND AS SHE EXPLAINS IT, SHE DOESN'T, LIKE, REALLY SEE THEM. SHE MORE SENSES THEM, BUT... IN HER MIND'S EYE SHE KNOWS WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. YEAH. SO THESE ENTITIES HAVE COME WITH YOU ON YOUR TRAVELS? - YES. - YES. AND AS TIME GOES ON, THE MAN HAS GOTTEN FROM OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AT MARIETTA TO BEING IN THE ROOM WITH HER. AND I'M ASSUMING YOU GUYS HAVE TAKEN HER TO, LIKE, A DOCTOR AND EVERYTHING. - YES. - AND WHAT DID THEY HAVE TO SAY? THEY FEEL IT MIGHT BE, LIKE, AN ANXIETY TYPE OF HALLUCINATION. WHAT ABOUT AIDEN? HAS HE EVER EXPERIENCED ANY ACTIVITY? - NO. - NO. - NONE? - NONE. - NONE. NOPE. - DOESN'T BELIEVE IN IT. - DOESN'T BELIEVE IN IT. HASN'T EXPERIENCED IT. - NOTHING? - NOTHING. - NOTHING. HOW CONVINCED ARE YOU THAT WHAT SHE'S EXPERIENCING IS PARANORMAL? I'M 99.9% CONVINCED. BEFORE WE SIT DOWN WITH GILLIAN AND HER BROTHER, AIDEN, WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THE HOUSE ITSELF. I HAVE A MINI DVA, K- II, EMF, PANASONIC. WE'LL START IN THE OFFICE, SINCE THAT'S WHERE THE FIRE HAPPENED. SO RIGHT THERE IS WHERE THE... - YES. - ...SHELF WAS THAT SET FIRE. YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT'S ALL BUBBLED STILL. WAIT. WHAT'S THAT? I THOUGHT I HEARD, LIKE, A VOICE. THIS IS RECORDING. LET'S JUST SIT AND LISTEN. LET'S GET THE... HERE. IT ALMOST SOUNDED LIKE A FEMALE. GIVE ME ONE SEC. JUST LISTEN. HERE, I'M GOING TO PUT THIS HERE. YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST GETTING TO KNOW SAM AND HIS FAMILY, AND YOU'RE REACHING OUT AND TALKING TO THEM. HOWEVER, IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK TO ANYBODY, IT SHOULD BE US, BECAUSE WE CAN ACTUALLY RECORD YOU, FIND OUT WHO YOU ARE, WHAT YOU WANT, DELIVER A MESSAGE FOR YOU. WE CAN HELP YOU, SO PLEASE TALK TO US. THESE DEVICES THAT WE HAVE, THEY CAN HEAR YOU EVEN IF WE CAN'T, SO IF YOU'RE HERE, CAN YOU JUST MAKE A NOISE WHEREVER YOU ARE? WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? THAT'S RIGHT IN THIS ROOM. IF THAT WAS YOU KNOCKING, CAN YOU DO IT AGAIN? HOLD ON. HOLD ON. IS THE HEATER COMING ON? IS THAT WHAT IT WAS? - WHAT? - HOLY ****! I THINK I SAW SOMETHING ON THAT CAMERA. WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? - WHAT? - HOLY ****! I THINK I SAW SOMETHING ON THAT CAMERA. WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? I THINK I JUST SOMETHING ON THIS CAMERA. REALLY? REWIND. REWIND. REWIND. RIGHT HERE. HOLD ON. WHAT? THAT'S THE CAT. HOW DID THE CAT GET OUT? LOOK. WATCH HIM. THIS IS US COMING IN. AND THEN WHERE DOES HE GO? IS THAT WHAT WE HEARD? THERE HE GOES. YEAH, BUT HE DIDN'T MAKE A SOUND, DID HE? I DON'T KNOW. THE SOUND WAS FROM IN HERE. YEAH. HE'S JUST WALKING. HE'S NOT MAKING TAPPING NOISES. NO, AND, HONESTLY, HE'S UPSTAIRS, AND THAT SOUND CAME FROM OVER HERE. RIGHT, OKAY, SO SOMETHING WAS TAPPING. DO YOU THINK IT WAS THE -- TAP IT AND SEE BECAUSE I FEEL -- THAT'S WHAT IT KIND OF LIKE IT SOUNDED LIKE TO ME. BUT THE HEATS NOT ON. FEEL IT. ITS NOT ON. OKAY, WELL, IT WAS TELLING US IT WAS HERE, SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY CONTINUE WITH WHAT WE WERE DOING. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. OKAY. DID YOU SEE THE FIRE START IN THIS HOUSE? DO YOU KNOW WHO DID THAT? AGAIN. RIGHT AFTER I TALKED ABOUT THE FIRE. I KEEP RECORDING. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO TELL US ABOUT THE FIRE? HOW DID THAT FIRE START? IF YOU HEAR YOURSELF ON THIS RECORDER, REACH OUT AND TOUCH THAT GREEN LIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. I LITERALLY SAID, "IF YOU HEAR YOURSELF IN THAT RECORDING, GRAB THIS GREEN LIGHT AND MAKE IT GO OFF," AND AS SOON AS YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FIRE, IT STARTED DOING THAT. THAT'S, LIKE, FOOTSTEPS. YEAH, IT'S, LIKE, RIGHT BEHIND US. LIKE, THUNK. THUNK. THUNK. THUNK. VERY SLOW. IT SOUNDED LIKE EITHER FOOTSTEPS OR SOMEONE KNOCKING SLOWLY. THERE IT IS AGAIN. THERE. WHAT IS THAT? HOLD ON. IS IT OUT HERE? MAYBE IF WE GO UPSTAIRS. I THINK SO, TOO. SO WE HEARD A FEMALE VOICE DOWNSTAIRS. WE'VE HEARD LOTS OF KNOCKS. DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE FIRE THAT STARTED DOWNSTAIRS? WHOSE FAULT WAS IT? WAS IT AN ACCIDENT? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET INTO ANY TROUBLE, BUT WAS IT YOU? ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE. MAYBE YES. - NO. - NO. DID YOU HEAR THAT RIGHT AT THE END? IT WAS LIKE, "NO." I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS CONFUSING. WE ARE GETTING THINGS. WE ARE GETTING THINGS. I THINK THAT WE NEED MORE INFORMATION, THOUGH. I JUST REALLY FEEL YOU SHOULD TALK TO GILLIAN. I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK TO HER. THERE'S DEFINITELY ACTIVITY IN THIS HOUSE, BUT SO FAR IT'S INCONSISTENT. COULD IT BE CONNECTED TO THE CEMETERY ACROSS THE STREET? IS THERE MORE THAN ONE GHOST HANGING AROUND? WE'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN WITH THE KIDS. ADAM WILL TALK TO AIDEN, WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE IN THE PARANORMAL, AND I WILL SPEAK WITH GILLIAN WHO HAS MORE EXPERIENCES THROUGH THE YEARS THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THIS FAMILY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PARANORMAL STUFF. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING? I BELIEVE IT IS PARANORMAL. THERE'S NO, LIKE, EXPLANATION, YOU KNOW, FOR HOW THE FIRE STARTED AND, YOU KNOW, KNOCKING. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING? FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS NOW I WOULD SENSE THIS MAN, LIKE A SILHOUETTE... - RIGHT. - ...SHADOW KIND OF FIGURE WATCHING ME, AND HAD A VERY MEAN, LIKE, ENERGY ABOUT HIM. HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANYTHING PARANORMAL HAPPEN TO YOU EVER? NO. NOTHING. WHAT ABOUT THE FIRE? JUST SEEMS LIKE A NORMAL, LIKE, ACCIDENT. ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE MAN? YEAH. HE JUST HAS SUCH A TERRIBLE ENERGY ABOUT HIM. WHAT DO YOU THINK HE COULD DO TO YOU? I MEAN, IF HE WAS THE ONE TO START THE FIRE, I'M AFRAID HE'LL TRY SOMETHING AGAIN. HOW DO YOU WANT THIS TO END? I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT END IN MY FAMILY JUST, LIKE, AT A SENSE OF PEACE. I DON'T LIKE SEEING THEM SCARED BY ALL THIS. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE IN THIS HOUSE? BECAUSE WE LIVE ACROSS A GRAVEYARD, I DON'T REALLY KNOW. AND YOUR PARENTS TOOK YOU TO A DOCTOR, RIGHT? FOR THE PAST YEAR, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN GOING TO SEE A THERAPIST BECAUSE I WAS THINKING MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT, AND EVERYBODY TOLD ME, YOU KNOW... I WOULD DESCRIBE IT, AND THEY SAID, "YOU'RE HAVING HALLUCINATIONS. YOU'RE INSANE." BUT YOU'RE NOT, THOUGH, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SEEING IT, YOU'RE SENSING IT. YEAH, AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS SAYING. I WAS -- I'M NOT SEEING A PERSON, LIKE, YOU KNOW, AROUND EVERYWHERE. - RIGHT. - I'M SENSING IT AT NIGHT. I FEEL LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON. WOULD YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE PSYCHIC? I DON'T REALLY KNOW. IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT GILLIAN AND AIDEN ARE HAVING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES IN THE SAME HOUSE. MAYBE GILLIAN DOES HAVE SOME PSYCHIC ABILITY, BUT WHO IS THIS ENTITY SHE'S SENSING? WE NEED MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS HOUSE AND THE CEMETERY ACROSS THE STREET. I'M GOING TO MEET WITH A LOCAL HISTORIAN TO FIND OUT WHO'S BURIED THERE. DORA CUSHMAN, SHE WAS 15 YEARS OLD, AND SHE'S BURIED UP THERE IN THE CEMETERY. I ALSO WANT TO GET SOME NAMES OF FORMER HOMEOWNERS OR ANYONE REMOTELY CONNECTED TO THIS PROPERTY. IT WAS ALL BRIGGS THAT LIVED UP THERE. WELL, GREAT. I MEAN, THIS IS GOOD INFORMATION TO HAVE. WELL, I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT JUST SOME OF THE LOCAL HISTORY HERE. MOST OF THESE HOUSES WERE BUILD BY THE BRIGGS FAMILY, HENCE BRIGGS HILL ROAD. - RIGHT. - AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS... I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN INTERESTING STORY. THIS GIRL IS BURIED IN THE CEMETERY. HER NAME WAS DORA CUSHMAN, AND AT 15 YEARS OLD SHE GOT PREGNANT, AND BASICALLY SHE WAS THE VICTIM OF A BOTCHED ABORTION. THIS GIRL IS BURIED IN THE CEMETERY. HER NAME WAS DORA CUSHMAN, AND AT 15 YEARS OLD SHE GOT PREGNANT, AND BASICALLY SHE WAS THE VICTIM OF A BOTCHED ABORTION. SHE HAD TAKEN CEDAR OIL. I GUESS THAT IN SMALL DOSES IS ENOUGH TO, LIKE, INITIATE A MISCARRIAGE-TYPE THING, BUT IF YOU TAKE TOO MUCH YOU DIE. I MEAN, THIS HAPPENED IN 1897. WHAT I FIND INTERESTING ABOUT IT IS THAT SHE'S THE SAME AGE AS GILLIAN. SO ANOTHER LOCAL TRAGEDY I LEARNED ABOUT WAS THE 1875 MURDER OF A MAN NAMED NOAH THOMPSON. WELL, AT LEAST WE HAVE NAMES. MAYBE WE SHOULD GO OVER TO THE CEMETERY. I WOULD LOVE TO GO THERE AND INVESTIGATE. GOING OUT TO THE CEMETERY THAT'S SO CLOSE TO THE HOUSE AND SEEING IF ANY OF THOSE NAMES MATCH UP TO ANYBODY WHO HAS EVER LIVED HERE IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL TO OUR CASE BECAUSE IF THEY'RE HERE, MAYBE THEY'RE THERE, AND IF THEY'RE THERE MAYBE THEY'RE HERE. THESE ARE OLD! THESE LOOK SO OLD! MY GOD. CUSHMAN. THIS IS DORA. THAT'S THE GIRL WHO DIED AT 15. -15 YEARS, 7 MONTHS. - YEAH. SO STRANGE THEY WERE BURIED HERE. THEY OWNED LAND IN LINCOLN, THE NEXT TOWN OVER. HERE'S BRIGGS. SO HE'S THE ONE THAT BUILT THE HOUSE? I THINK SO. I'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DEEDS. LET ME GET THIS OUT. WE DON'T MEAN TO DISTURB YOUR SLEEP, AND NORMALLY WE DON'T INVESTIGATE CEMETERIES FOR THAT REASON, BUT WE THINK SOMEONE IS IN THAT HOUSE THAT'S BOTHERING THAT FAMILY, AND WE JUST WANT TO KNOW IF WHATEVER IS IN THAT HOUSE IS CONNECTED HERE. CAN YOU TELL US YOUR NAME? IS THERE A DORA CUSHMAN HERE? LET'S LISTEN TO THIS. IT'S QUIET. ALL RIGHT. WELL, SHOULD WE HEAD BACK? - YEAH. - OKAY. SINCE IT'S SO QUIET OUT HERE, WE'RE GOING TO REFOCUS OUR INVESTIGATION BACK ON THE HOUSE. THAT'S WHERE THE ACTIVITY IS. WELL, IF THERE'S TAPPING ON THE WINDOW, I WANT TO BRING THE GEOPHONE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY VIBRATIONS. TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO START IN GILLIAN'S ROOM. - SHOULD WE TRY THE OVILUS? - YEAH. SHE'S SENSING A MALE ENTITY AND HEARS KNOCKS ON HER WINDOW. IF THIS ACTIVITY IS REALLY FOLLOWING THIS FAMILY FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE, GILLIAN COULD BE THE REASON. SO I PUT A GEOPHONE ON THE WINDOW. IT SENSES VIBRATION. SHE SAID SOMETHING TAPS ON THE WINDOW. SO WHEN SOMETHING TAPS ON THE WINDOW IF WE'RE IN HERE, THIS BLUE LIGHT IS GOING TO GO OFF. THIS IS HER DRAWINGS THAT SHE DID OF THE GHOSTS THAT SHE SEES. I'M GOING TO USE THIS AS A TRIGGER OBJECT, SO IF ANYTHING TOUCHES THIS PAPER OR GETS NEAR IT, THIS ALARM IS GOING TO SOUND. I'M GOING TO HAVE THIS ON THAT AND THE OVILUS. IT USES THE ENVIRONMENTAL READINGS TO PRODUCE WORDS. DO YOU KNOW WHO GILLIAN IS? GILLIAN HAS DRAWN WHAT SHE SEES. DO YOU SEE WHAT SHE DID, HERE? CAN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK? ARE YOU FROM GEORGIA? DID YOU COME HERE WITH SAM, OR DID YOU COME HERE WITH GILLIAN OR AIDEN? IT SAYS AIDEN, RIGHT? IT SAYS AIDEN LOUD AND CLEAR. IT SAYS AIDEN LOUD AND CLEAR. IT SAYS AIDEN LOUD AND CLEAR. WHY WOULD IT SAY AIDEN? OF ALL THE PEOPLE TO SAY, WHY WOULD IT SAY AIDEN? WHY AIDEN? DOES HE REMIND YOU OF SOMEONE? LET'S TRY SOME OF THE NAMES FROM THE CEMETERY. IS YOUR LAST NAME BRIGGS? DO YOU KNOW WHO DORA CUSHMAN IS? DO YOU REMEMBER THE MURDER OF NOAH THOMPSON? MY THEORY IS IF I KEEP BRINGING UP THESE NEWSWORTHY EVENTS AND THEY REMEMBER IT, THAT WILL TELL ME THE TIME PERIOD OF WHOEVER THIS IS. YEAH. NO. I GOT IT. I'M ON THE SAME PAGE. SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY LISTEN TO IT. DO YOU HEAR THAT? IT SAYS "NOAH THOMPSON." YEAH. WHAT WAS NOAH THOMPSON AGAIN? IT WAS JUST A BIG MURDER IN TOWN IN 1871. I DON'T THINK THAT NOAH THOMPSON IS HERE, BUT I'M WONDERING IF WHATEVER IS HERE IS FROM THE TIME PERIOD OF 1871 AND KNOWS ABOUT THAT STORY. OKAY, WELL, I MEAN, A COUPLE CLUES KIND OF. YEAH. I'M GOING TO SIT RIGHT HERE. I'LL COME OUT THERE WITH YOU, ACTUALLY. IF YOU'RE IN THIS HOUSE, KNOCK ON SOMETHING. CAN YOU DO THAT FOR US, PLEASE? WHAT DOES IT SAY? "EUROPE. COAT. PARAGRAPH. FOUND." IS THERE SOMEONE HERE WHO WANTS TO TALK? THE MORE YOU TELL US, THE MORE WE CAN HELP YOU. WE'D LOVE TO KNOW WHO WE'RE TALKING TO. IT'S RIGHT -- THAT SCARED ME. "FOREIGN." ARE YOU FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY? ARE YOU FOLLOWING THIS FAMILY? ALL RIGHT. LISTEN TO THIS. WHAT OTHER FORMS OF COMMUNICATION CAN WE TRY? IF IT WON'T TALK TO US, MAYBE IT WILL COMMUNICATE WITH GILLIAN? YEAH, I THINK -- I'M, LIKE, AT A LOSS. LIKE, I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING HERE. I KNOW IT IS. BUT IT'S VERY MINOR EXCEPT FOR THE FIRE. EXCEPT FOR THE FIRE WHICH... WE SHOULD PROBABLY CHECK THAT OUT AND SEE. YEAH. THE FIRE IS REALLY TERRIFYING TO THIS FAMILY, SO WE'RE GOING TO RUN A TEST. WE'RE GOING TO PLACE THE SAME TYPE OF CANDLES THAT STARTED THE FIRE IN A TRAY CONNECTED TO OUR PROXIMITY SENSOR AND SEE IF IT GOES OFF ON ITS OWN. SO WHOEVER IS HERE WITH US, THE OWNERS OF THE HOUSE SEEM TO THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE STARTED A FIRE WITH THESE CANDLES. THE ONE THING I NOTICE ABOUT THESE... DOES THAT SEEM LIKE A DIFFERENT MATERIAL THAN A NORMAL... LIKE, LET ME GET A REGULAR TEA LIGHT. YEAH, BECAUSE WE HAVE BOTH. I WANT TO COMPARE THE CANDLE THE FAMILY USED WITH A MORE GENERIC BRAND. FIRST THING I NOTICE -- THE WARNING LABEL FOR THESE, THE FAMILY'S CANDLE, IS FAR MORE INTENSE THAN THESE. "BURN WITHIN SIGHT. KEEP AWAY FROM THINGS THAT CATCH FIRE. PLACE ON A PROTECTED HEAT-RESISTANT, LEVEL SURFACE." THIS CANDLE DOESN'T HAVE THOSE FIRST TWO BOLD SENTENCES. HAND ME THAT BLUE HOCKEY MASK RIGHT THERE. LIKE, THIS STYROFOAM, HIGHLY FLAMMABLE... YEAH. ...SO IT'S JUST GOING TO MELT AND SMOLDER, AND ONCE IT WENT UP, IT WENT UP. YOU KNOW, TEA LIGHTS ARE A VERY INNOCENT CANDLE, YET IT ONLY TAKES ONE INSTANCE FOR YOU TO SET IT SOMEWHERE AND JUST BE LIKE, "IT'S GOING TO BE FINE" AND IT NOT BE OKAY. DOES ANYONE KNOW ABOUT THE ACCIDENT THAT HAPPENED WITH THE CANDLE? DID YOU COME TRY TO WARN THE FAMILY? IS THAT WHY YOU BANGED ON THE DOOR? WHAT IF THAT'S WHAT IT WAS? THERE WAS FOUR LOUD BANGS ON THE OUTSIDE DOOR. WELL, KELLEY SAID THAT IT SOUNDED, LIKE, AS IF A NEIGHBOR WAS COMING TO... - CHECK ON THEM. - ...MAKE SURE THEY WERE OKAY. I MEAN, WHAT'S MORE NEIGHBORLY THAN A GHOST THAT LIVES IN YOUR HOUSE? RIGHT. WE FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THE FIRE WAS NATURAL, BUT I'LL SEND THE PHOTOS TO A FIREMAN I KNOW TO CONFIRM. WHOEVER IS HERE REFUSES TO TALK WITH US. TONIGHT, WE'LL INCLUDE GILLIAN IN THE INVESTIGATION. WE ALSO CALLED IN STEPHANIE. SHE'S A PSYCHIC WHO CAN HELP IDENTIFY THE ACTIVITY, AND ALSO WORK WITH GILLIAN, WHO WE THINK MAY BE PSYCHIC, AS WELL. WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING? FIVE YEARS AGO, I STARTED SENSING THIS MAN WHO WAS ALWAYS STANDING AT MY DOOR, AND HE HAD A VERY NEGATIVE... YOU'RE SEEING THEM INSIDE YOUR MIND'S EYE. - YEAH. YEAH. - OKAY. IT'S ACTUALLY VERY RARE TO SEE THEM PHYSICALLY, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING IS PSYCHIC PHENOMENON. WE WANTED TO HAVE GILLIAN LEAD THE WAY. YEAH. DO YOU FEEL ANYTHING IN THIS ROOM, OR... KIND OF. IT'S -- I DON'T FEEL A PERSON. I JUST FEEL, LIKE, ALMOST A WEIRD ENERGY FROM WHERE, LIKE, THE FIRE WAS. WHAT DO YOU FEEL IN HERE? ANYTHING? WHEN I WALKED RIGHT IN, I FELT THE FIRE, BUT I IMMEDIATELY WANTED TO GO UPSTAIRS WHEN I WALKED IN, SO I WAS FEELING SOME ENERGY UPSTAIRS. AND GILLIAN, IF YOU PICK UP ON ANYTHING, CALL IT OUT. - OKAY. - CALL IT OUT. I CAN'T STOP LOOKING AT THAT CORNER. I LOOKED OVER THERE, AND I JUST, LIKE, FELT SICK TO MY STOMACH. THERE'S A GUY SITTING THE CORNER DRINKING WHISKEY. I CAN'T STOP LOOKING AT THAT CORNER. I LOOKED OVER THERE, AND I JUST, LIKE, FELT SICK TO MY STOMACH. THERE'S A GUY SITTING THE CORNER DRINKING WHISKEY. HOW OLD IS HE? I WANT TO SAY, LIKE, 40s-ISH. YOU AGREE? THAT'S AROUND THE AGE OF THE MAN I SENSED. IS IT THE SAME PERSON? EXCUSE ME, SIR. I DON'T MEAN TO BOTHER YOU. I KNOW YOU'RE KIND OF RELAXING. WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IF WE COULD. CAN YOU TELL US YOUR NAME, SIR? WE DON'T RECOGNIZE YOU. ARE YOU FROM THIS AREA? HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING FOR A MAN WHO OUR FRIEND, GILLIAN, HAS SEEN, AND WE FEEL LIKE HE MIGHT HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND FOLLOWED HER. IS THAT YOU? HE'S TALKING ABOUT GAMBLING, PLAYING CARDS, AND POKER CHIPS. THAT'S WEIRD. YEAH. SO YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE. WE'RE HERE TO CHECK UP ON OUR FRIEND, GILLIAN. CAN YOU TELL US WHY YOU'RE HERE? HE JUST SAID, "YOU DON'T HAVE THE TIME." DID YOU BUILD THIS HOUSE? HE'S FRESH, LIKE, INAPPROPRIATELY FRESH. DO YOU FEEL LIKE HE CAME WITH THE HOUSE? I THINK HE WANDERED IN. I DON'T FEEL NECESSARILY CONNECTED TO THE HOUSE, BUT I FEEL LIKE HE'S COMFORTABLE HERE. HE WANTS NO PART OF TELLING US ANYTHING. I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE INTO GILLIAN'S ROOM SO IT'S... I KEEP LOOKING OVER AT LIKE THE STAIRCASE. I FEEL, LIKE, SOMETHING IS, LIKE, THERE. - HE'S STILL OUT THERE. - IS IT THE SAME GUY? IT'S, LIKE, EVERY TIME I LOOK OUT THE DOOR, I JUST FEEL SICK. LET'S USE THIS FOR A SECOND AND SEE. SO WHAT THIS DOES IS THIS SCANS THROUGH FREQUENCIES, LIKE FM FREQUENCIES, AND SOMETIMES THEY CAN MANIPULATE THE AUDIO AND KIND OF SAY WORDS OR SENTENCES TO US. SO SEE THIS. PROVE THAT YOU CAN TALK TO US. GO AHEAD, AND USE THAT DEVICE, AND TELL US YOUR NAME. WHAT IF I GO SIT IN THE CHAIR ACROSS FROM HIM? GO AHEAD. AS LOUD AS YOU CAN, TELL US WHY YOU'RE HERE. IS THERE SOMEONE YOU'RE HERE WITH? DO YOU WANT SOME MORE WHISKEY? - WHISKEY. - I HEARD THAT. - WHISKEY. - WHISKEY. I JUST GOT THE CHILLS. I LOVE THAT THAT'S THE ONE THING HE CAN COMMUNICATE TO US IS WHISKEY. I FEEL LIKE HE'S DONE WITH THIS THING. YEAH. I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING MOVE IN THE ROOM ACROSS THE HALL. THERE IS AN OLDER WOMAN SITTING IN THE ROCKER. WHAT'S THE TIME PERIOD ON HER WOULD YOU SAY? I'D SAY PROBABLY LATE 1800s. AS SOON AS SHE SHOWED UP, HE RAN. - HE LEFT? - YEAH. IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE BELONGS HERE, AND HE DOESN'T. - OKAY. - THAT'S WHAT I WOULD GET FROM IT. IT WAS ALMOST, LIKE, INSTANT. THAT DEVICE I JUST PUT THERE, THAT CAN HEAR YOU EVEN IF WE CAN'T, OKAY? SHE'S SITTING THERE KNITTING. VERY PEACEFUL. THAT WAS MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER'S CHAIR. YEAH. - WHAT'S HER NAME? - FERNIE. FERNIE, IS THAT YOU? SHE'S DRIVING OUT WHAT THAT WAS. REALLY? ALMOST LIKE PROTECTION. COULD SHE BE DOING THAT PERIODICALLY FOR A WHILE? I MEAN, BECAUSE -- I WOULD SAY SO, BECAUSE LITERALLY THE MINUTE I SAW MOVEMENT, HE LOOKED AT ME WIDE-EYED AND GONE, RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW. IT WAS A VERY STRONG PRESENCE FROM HER, SO I'M ASSUMING THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT A BIG FAN OF IT. IS YOUR NAME FERNIE? DO YOU WATCH OVER GILLIAN AND KELLEY AND SAM? IF YOU'RE NOT FERNIE, CAN YOU TELL US YOUR NAME SO WE GET IT RIGHT? HOW ARE YOU FEELING, GILLIAN? I FEEL OKAY. LET'S LISTEN TO THIS. I THINK IT'S TIME TO STOP. THAT'S SO WEIRD. I THINK MAYBE WE CAN LET THESE LADIES GO... YEAH. ...AND THEN WE CAN JUST CONTINUE ON. GILLIAN'S GREAT-GRANDMOTHER IS NOT RESPONDING, SO IT COULD BE SOMEBODY ELSE. ADAM AND I ARE GOING TO CONTINUE LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE WITHOUT STEPHANIE AND GILLIAN. WE'LL GIVE THE MASTER BEDROOM ONE LAST TRY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY HAVE VOICES. LET'S TRY SOME OF THE NAMES FROM THE CEMETERY AGAIN. WE'RE LOOKING FOR... SOMEONE WHO... MAYBE LIVED HERE FOR A LONG TIME. WERE YOU RELATED TO ANY OF THE BRIGGS FAMILY? HOW ABOUT THE GIRL WHO DIED DURING THE ABORTION? DO YOU KNOW WHY THE CUSHMAN FAMILY WAS BURIED IN THIS CEMETERY AND NOT ONE CLOSER TO THEIR HOME IN LINCOLN? IT SEEMED LIKE YOU MAY HAVE RECOGNIZED NOAH THOMPSON? DO YOU REMEMBER THAT MURDER? WAS THERE SOMEONE HERE... - THAT WAS SOMETHING. - IT SAID "LINCOLN." YEAH, 100%. WAS THERE SOMEONE HERE --  - THAT WAS SOMETHING. - IT SAID "LINCOLN." YEAH, 100%. - "LINCOLN." - "LINCOLN." WAS THERE SOMEONE HERE THEY WERE CONNECTED TO? IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT'S DORA HERSELF, BUT BECAUSE IT RESPONDED TO LINCOLN, WHICH IS A LOCAL TOWN. RIGHT. IT MAKES ME THINK IT'S A LOCAL PERSON. IT DIDN'T TRAVEL HERE WITH THEM. NO. I THINK WHATEVER IS HERE IS IN AND OUT, AND I THINK GILLIAN HAS PSYCHIC ABILITIES. I'D LOVE TO FIND OUT WHO'S HERE, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ANYTHING THAT'S TRYING TO GET SOME CRAZY MESSAGE ACROSS. SHE'S GOING TO EXPERIENCE ACTIVITY. I MEAN, THERE IS A CEMETERY ACROSS THE STREET. I'M READY TO TALK TO THESE GUYS, AND LET THEM KNOW. THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING CASES WE'VE EVER INVESTIGATED. WE'VE HAD EXPERIENCES WITH MULTIPLE ENTITIES, BUT NO SPIRIT WANTS TO DELIVER A MESSAGE HOWEVER, WE STILL HAVE PLENTY TO TELL THE FAMILY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO GILLIAN. FIRST OF ALL, WE WANTED TO FIGURE OUT THE FIRE. RIGHT. WE FOCUSED ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THINGS COULD HAVE HAPPENED NATURALLY. I CONSULTED WITH A CAPTAIN OF A FIRE DEPARTMENT. I SENT HIM ALL YOUR PHOTOS. HE SAID THOSE CANDLES ABSOLUTELY LIT THAT FIRE. THEY LIT SOMETHING NEARBY, EITHER THE STYROFOAM INSIDE ONE OF THE HOCKEY MASKS OR PART OF THE SHELF ITSELF, AND IT PROBABLY SMOLDERED FOR A WHILE BEFORE IT ACTUALLY IGNITED... RIGHT. ...SO I WOULD SAY 100% YOU CAN RULE OUT SOMETHING TRYING TO BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN. YES. 100%. YOU KNOW, I'D RATHER FEEL STUPID FOR LIGHTING A CANDLE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. - RIGHT. IT'S SUCH A HUGE RELIEF. YEAH. I MEAN, YOU WERE SLEEPING IN SHIFTS. - YEAH. YEAH. - RIGHT. I'M SORRY. THIS WHOLE WEIGHT JUST CAME OFF, YOU KNOW? I KNOW. I WOULD BE THE EXACT SAME WAY. SO YOU'RE GOOD. YOU'RE GOOD. - YES. - GOOD. THANK YOU. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOUR HOUSE ISN'T HAUNTED. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. DURING OUR INVESTIGATION WE HAD EXPERIENCES. LIKE, WE WERE INVESTIGATING IN YOUR OFFICE, AND WE HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE FOOTSTEPS. WE ALSO RECORDED AN EVP IN GILLIAN'S ROOM THAT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU. - RIGHT. - I HEAR IT NOW. - RIGHT. - YEP. AND IT'S CLEAR. FOR SOME REASON THIS PERSON EITHER HAD TAKEN LIKING TO HIM, OR WAS JUST REPEATING WHAT I SAID. OR MAYBE THEY'RE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE HE DOESN'T GIVE THEM THE TIME OF DAY. SO LAST NIGHT, WE BROUGHT IN STEPHANIE, AND SHE'S A PSYCHIC THAT WE SOMETIMES WORK WITH. STEPHANIE PICKED UP ON A WOMAN SITTING IN THAT ROCKING CHAIR UPSTAIRS. I KNOW THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS PASSED ON TO YOU. SHE SAID SHE WAS KIND OF A PROTECTIVE PRESENCE ALMOST. THEN SHE ALSO SENSED A MAN SITTING UPSTAIRS, JUST KIND OF AN UNSAVORY CHARACTER, BUT AS SOON AS THAT OLDER WOMAN CAME INTO LIGHT, HE BOLTED, AND SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHE HAS SORT OF STAKE IN THE HOUSE. THAT ALSO MAKES US WONDER IF AFTER YOU HAD THE FIRE WHY SOMEBODY WOULD BE BANGING ON THE DOOR? RIGHT. MAYBE SHE WAS TRYING TO CHECK ON YOU. WITH ALL THIS, I'M SURE YOU'RE WONDERING IS IT CONNECTED TO YOUR PREVIOUS HOUSES? - OR WITH GILLIAN? - RIGHT. WHAT WE THINK IS HAPPENING HERE IS EVERYTHING ELSE FROM YOUR PAST HOUSES, I DON'T THINK THAT'S HERE WITH YOU. WE DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT GEORGIA WAS GEORGIA, AND THIS IS VERMONT, AND YOU WANTED THE NEW LEASE, AND YOU GOT IT. NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT GILLIAN. WE BROUGHT HER ON THE INVESTIGATION WITH US, AND SHE PICKED UP ON THE SAME THINGS AS STEPHANIE. WHAT WE THINK IS GOING ON WITH GILLIAN IS SHE DEFINITELY DOES HAVE ACTUAL PSYCHIC, MEDIUM-TYPE ABILITIES. WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE WITH HER? I KNOW. STEPHANIE WILL GIVE HER SOME ANSWERS THERE AS FAR AS HOW SHE SHOULD HANDLE IT FROM HERE ON OUT. HOW MUCH OF A CONCERN SHOULD WE HAVE FOR... FROM CREEPY, OLD, DRUNK GAMBLERS... - ...CREEPY... - ...BY OUR DAUGHTER'S BED. YOU KNOW, I WOULD SAY THIS GUY REALLY WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH US. I WOULD SAY NOT TO WORRY ABOUT HIM. THESE OLDER HOMES, WE FIND THAT PEOPLE COME IN AND OUT OF THEM ALL THE TIME. RIGHT. ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA. AND YOU HAVE A CEMETERY, YOU KNOW, RIGHT DOWN THE STREET, SO THEY MAY SEE YOUR HOME AS A REVOLVING DOOR ALMOST. OKAY. YOU KNOW, USUALLY WE FIND OUT WHO'S HAUNTING THE PLACE. WE HAVE AN IDENTITY FOR YOU, AND IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THESE GHOSTS AREN'T REALLY REACHING OUT, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THEY ARE. YOU KNOW, THIS WAS MORE ABOUT YOU AND GILLIAN, AND THESE GHOSTS ARE JUST GOING ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS. BUSINESS. RIGHT. THE BIGGEST THING IS THAT GILLIAN HAS DIRECTION AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT SHE NEEDS TO DO. AND WE'RE SAFE IN OUR HOME, SO... - YES. FOR SURE. - YEAH. BEFORE WE LEAVE, I WANTED YOU TO TALK WITH STEPHANIE. GET SOME IDEAS ON HOW TO HANDLE THINGS. EVERYTHING IS UP TO YOU, HOW FAR YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS. THE BEST ADVICE THAT I CAN GIVE IS EVERY SINGLE DAY WHEN YOU WAKE UP, YOU'RE GOING TO PRETEND THAT THERE IS A BUBBLE AROUND YOU, AND NOBODY CAN COME INSIDE THAT SPACE. THAT STOPS OTHER PEOPLE'S ENERGY FROM GETTING INTO YOU. IF THAT GUY IS SITTING OUTSIDE YOUR BEDROOM OR ANYBODY THAT YOU DON'T WANT HERE, JUST MAKE SURE TO JUST TELL THEM TO GO AWAY. - RIGHT. - IT'S YOUR SPACE. THIS IS YOUR HOME NOW. THEY HAVE TO RESPECT WHO YOU ARE, AND WHY YOU'RE HERE. - YEAH. SO DON'T EVER BE AFRAID OF IT. ALL RIGHT. THE STRONGER YOU ARE, AND YOU PROJECT THAT STRENGTH, THAT WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THEM BACK OFF. YEAH. I THINK THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF GOOD THINGS FOR YOU. - YEAH. THANKS. - YOU'RE WELCOME. THE DIFFERENCE IN THE FAMILY FOUR DAYS AGO VERSUS NOW IS HUGE, AND IT IS WHY WE DO THIS.
