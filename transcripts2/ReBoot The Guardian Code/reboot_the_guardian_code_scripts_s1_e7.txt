 Yeah, nice one, man. Hey, superstar. Ready for the big game? Can't wait to watch you kick some serious Vic High butt! I don't know about that. Vikeye's pretty good. And the Codebreakers... Well, we're still a work in progress. Yeah, but 'cause of you the team hasn't lost a game all season, so that's pretty good progress. And I'm impressed with how you're handling everything. School, basketball, extracurricular protection

 of a cyber dimension. Thanks. I just wish my dad saw it that way. He's still on my case about grades and stuff. Go, Codebreakers! Codebreakers rule! Codebreakers! Codebreakers! Codebreakers! We better go settle her down. Have a good game, Trey. - Good luck. - Thanks. Don't worry about your dad. Thanks, man. Codebreakers!

 Codebreakers! Save it for the game, Vera. Why? The Codebreakers need all the encouragement that they can get. She has a point. Hi. You're Trey's dad, right? I'm Austin, this is Parker, Tamra and Vera. We're Trey's friends. Yes, of course. He told me all about you. You're the video game bunch that keep Trey from his studies. Get in here, guys. All right, I wanna stick to the game plan. Every play runs through Trey. Got it? Sentinels, take your positions. We will storm Virusylum and release all the viruses within it. Load the cyber catapult. Fire! What's up, Vera? A Megabyte alert. We have to go. Great timing, Megadoofus. Codebreakers on three. One, two, three... Codebreakers! Let's go. We haven't identified where the corruption is coming from. It must be the Sorcerer. Only a lunatic would attack Virusylum. There's no sign of dark code. Not yet. I'm sure he's got plenty of tricks up his sleeve. Megabyte's surprise attack on Virusylum caught the Department of Internet Security off guard. Let's get in there and give them a hand. Yeah, all those viruses getting sprung loose? We can't let that happen. What about Trey's game? We ll be back before half-time. Go, Guardians! Okay, let's get to Virusylum. I'll take us on a wide approach to stay out of sight. The DIS are holding them off. We might get a free shot. Good call, Enigma. I have Megabyte in my sights. Got it, Googz? Dead center. Locking on target. Hold it steady, Enigma. Double blast, Googz, in three, two, one! Look at this. It's that mystery code again. Keep tracking it. Unreal! I don't believe it. Did we just frag Megabyte? Score one for the good guys! Yes! Yeah! There we go! Where are they? Congratulations, Guardians. Hurry back to catch the rest of Trey's game. Awesome! Let's go. Wait. What if we make a little detour first? I don't like where this is going. Look, the sentinels are out here getting spanked by the DIS patrol. It's the perfect opportunity to take care of some unfinished business in the fortress. What unfinished business? The sphere we left behind. You mean the sphere you left behind? It could answer a lot of questions about what we're up against, about my dad. Fine. We'll be in and out, I promise. The Virusylum attack seems to be under control now. No viruses were released. What happened to the code we were tracking? It just vanished, like it's done before. This is the first time we've seen it without the presence of dark code. But you still think it's connected to the Sorcerer? Yes. Somehow. My gut tells me he was involved in this attack. A massive release of viruses. An outbreak. A plague. It would have been devastating, but your replicant failed. It was inferior. Sub-par. Flawed. Well, this experiment is still in the beta testing phase. As I've pointed out, replicating perfection is easier said than done. You're holding back. I want Megabyte replicants at full potential. Nothing less. Maximum strength. Yes, of course. But doing so will drain far too much of my own power. Only temporarily. A much better option than deletion, don't you think? Enough! I will do it! What was that? I will do what you ask. Of course you will. That was impressive. Thanks. Sneak attacks are my specialty. That's for sure. Come on, in and out like I said. Hmm. Maximum replication power or deletion? Maximum power it is. Oh, the indignities I must suffer. Okay, Googz. Light it up. There. The sphere is in the throne. What the... Not possible. We fragged you back at Virusylum. We all saw it. You blew up real good. You must have me confused with another virus. What? Another Megabyte? Double trouble! Code disruptor! No way! Ugh. Make that triple trouble. You Guardians are becoming quite a nuisance. What have I told you about dropping by unannounced? Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. Do I have your attention now? More or less. Rip them to shreds! Too slow. Look up! You missed me. Dude, that was awesome! Thanks. It was just basic trajectory converter mapping. Sentinels, finish them! Firewall! Yes! Yeah! There you go! Now that's how you end the half strong! Good work out there, guys. Hey, Trey! Locker room's that way. I know, coach. I just gotta go check on something. Hey. What's this about, son? Nothing. I'll be right back. Hey! Hey. Now, slow down. Now what could be so important that you'd leave your teammates in the middle of a game? You wouldn't understand. It's those video game delinquents, isn't it? They didn't even stick around to watch the game. I'm telling you right now they are a bad influence. You don't know them. They're my friends. What's happening, Vera? Why'd you guys leave the game? And where is everybody? Vector, Enigma and Googz are under attack in Megabyte's fortress. What? He's making replicants of himself. Multiple Megabytes? I'm going in. What about the Codebreakers? Won't there be consequences if you miss the second half of the game? Yeah. 100 percent probability. But some things are more important than basketball. I can't keep this up much longer. Enigma, hyperlink behind the sentinels. Then Googz, drop the firewall and we'll hit them from both sides. Got it. Hunh! Or DFrag could just show up out of nowhere and do that. I heard Megabyte was being a mega pain. That's for sure. He went this way. Come on! Impressive specimens, indeed. But generating them drains me so. Looks like Megabyte's been busy. We have to stop him from making more replicants. Yeah. And shut down the replicator for good this time. Leave it to me. Destroy them! Yeah, this is gonna be sweet! Power surge! No! Now that's what I call a four-point play. Yes! Uh-oh. Not done yet. You guys deal with the sentinels. I'm gonna get what we came here for. Zip board! Yes! Got it! Meet your demise, Guardian. Vector! My arm! Vector suit breech. 20 percent. Oh, man. We gotta close up that rip. Cyber sealer. That should stop the exposure. Thanks. I owe you one for sure. Let's get outta here. Googz, Enigma, meet us on the tower. Ah. This sphere seems to be of great interest to the Guardians. Surely they will attempt to retrieve it again. What is this? Hmm. Austin? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. It's just a small cut. Yeah, but it could have been a lot worse. Hey. What's happening in the game? The Codebreakers are losing by five points with 36 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Oh, man, I gotta go! All right, now work it around for an open look. If we don't score, foul right away, all right? Don't worry, I'll score. And where have you been? Huh? You know what? Never mind. Just get out there. Let's go. Let's go! You can do it! Ha ha! Yeah! Yeah! What happens now? He got fouled. If he makes this free throw, we win. Go, Codebreakers! A four-point play! His second of the day. What a comeback! It was selfish. It was inconsiderate. Do I need to continue? Because I can. How could you disappear during the middle of a basketball game? I'm sorry, Dad. Where were you? Does it matter? I... I came back in time to win it. Oh, Trey. You think that's all I care about? Winning? This is about discipline. Commitment. Showing respect to your teammates. I'm worried about you, son. And I need you to tell me now, where were you? He was helping me. Excuse me? I got into some trouble. It could have turned out real bad. But Trey showed up just in time. Really? Yeah. Your son kinda saved my life. I see. I'll be waiting in the car for you, son. Thanks for that. I have no idea what I would have told him. I told him the truth. I just left out a few cyber details. Inept. Incompetent. How did this plan backfire, Megabyte? Guardians. They are a menace. And the replicator, can it be fixed? Repaired? I'm afraid not. Fortunately I have a surplus of sentinels but unfortunately the replicants were all destroyed. I must admit they did not compare to the original. Maybe it wasn't the replicants after all. Maybe the source code was the problem. But no longer. No, please! Stop! Stop! What is this red code? I injured a Guardian in battle. He leaked it. No. It can't be. Blood. Human blood. The Guardians are human. Humans in cyberspace. This changes everything.
