 Megabyte. It's taking too long. What should I call you? Something that suits your unique code-corrupting skill set. Chaos? Mayhem? Nuisance? Speaking of which. Well, well. You seem to have set yourself up quite nicely, Megabyte. Yes, quite.

 My sentinel army is at your disposal. Good. We have a big day. A full agenda. Lots to do. Are you ready? You requested a distraction. I have a perfect one. A cat virus, that's it? It will be very effective, I assure you. All right. It'll have to do. Now, get to it and don't fail me, Megabyte. Release the cat virus into a data stream. Captain of the basketball team on the verge of failing

 a course a month into the semester is unacceptable, Trey. I know. I'm sorry, Dad, but this course? It... I mean, principles of coding. I've never even written code before. It's a course like any other. You pay attention. You study. You get good grades. It's like a foreign language, Dad. I... Don't make excuses, Trey. Now, Coach Gorley says you need a B average to stay on the team so I hope that you are taking this seriously. I am. Okay? I swear. But it's not just school and basketball. No? Well, what else is there? Hmm? What, playing video games? No. Now, you have a test in this coding course today, is that correct? Yes, second period. Well, there's no time like the present for you to start turning this thing around. I know. I'll ace the test and I'll get my average up. I promise. Now that's the kind of commitment I like to hear. Hey Moji is probably the best new group I've heard all year, and after the next track drops I predict they're going to explode. It'll be available for download next week but I have an exclusive sneak preview here on Tamra Says. So sit back and take a listen. What the... Aw, how cute. Look at its little face. More like how annoying. Hey. What's up? Either Hey Moji has a new lead singer or Tamra Says just got hacked with a cat video pop-up. She's not the only one. Check it out. Enough, enough, enough! I have determined that it is a virus. You will need to trap it. So we're cat catchers, now? Yes. If you don't stop this cutie pie from spreading it could clog up the entire internet. I'm telling you, cats are just trouble. Trouble? This cat looks totally scrumptious. Wait, do I actually want to eat a cat? No, I definitely do not. I would like to cuddle it. So how do we catch it? I will code an appropriate containment carrier. Once you've captured the cat virus, take it to Virusylum. Virus what? Virusylum. An impenetrable cyber prison where the Department of Internet Security keeps captured viruses. DIS has a jail for viruses? Sweet. Okay, okay. Let's do this. Is there, uh, some sort of cyber cat nip we can use to speed things along? Not that I'm aware of. I'm sure we'll figure it out. It doesn't hurt to think ahead. Yeah, but you always overthink. It's just a cat virus, right? It's a guardian mission. We need a game plan. We can't afford to waste time. And we won't. Unless you wanna keep talking about it. Fine. Let's just do this. Why don't you try holding your breath and counting to ten? Or is that the cure for the hiccups? You know, everything's just a big joke to you, isn't it? Hey, boys. Play nice. Whatever. I don't have time for this. What a grouch. The cat virus has been tracked to this data stream hub. You must prevent it from entering a main data stream and spreading more. There it is. And there it goes! I'll get it. Hold up, Vector. I have the carrier. So move! You're so slow. You can't just run at it. You'll spook it. We should sneak up from behind it. Corner it. You want us to tip toe around? Who said anything about tip toe? I said sneak. Guys, there it goes again. Hurry! It's infecting anything it touches. Where'd it go? Man, it's shifty. Uh-oh, it's headed straight for our data stream. Zip board. Woah! Come on, guys. We'll track them from the codec. This is so rad! You guys are missing out. Vector, just catch that cat virus before it corrupts all the data in the stream. Too late. Phase one is in motion. The distraction is happening. Do your part, Megabyte. And I'm in. Sentinels, invade and infect! Okay. Trackers show that the cat virus should be here somewhere. No sign of Vector. Yeah, big surprise. He's probably still surfing that data stream. There it is, over there. Sneak around behind it. We'll corner it. Go slow. Hello, kitty. Woo! Coming through! I gotcha! Nice grab. Technically I should get an assist. An assist? You almost blew it again. I'm lucky my shields held up, otherwise I would have been infected. Oh, come on, grumpy cat. Chill. Let's just get to the virusylum and finish the mission. It's even more delicious up close. Just analyze it, Vera. Fine. It doesn't appear to be overly complex. Once I have its composition I can stop the adorable cat videos from popping up everywhere. Oh. The cat virus contains traces of another familiar virus. Megabyte. Cats and Megabyte. Two things I can't stand. Sentinels, prepare to bring down the first firewall. Fire! The building security has been compromised. The Nova X3J. Beautiful. Exquisite. Viral attack detected. Megabyte is invading Pogo Computer Systems security hub. Get us there, Vera. Setting coordinates now. Maybe we should just let Pogo's security deal with Megabyte. We go drop the cat off at Virusylum and we can get back to school. You wanna go to school instead of fighting Megabyte? Spill it, D-Frag. You've been acting weird all morning. I have a coding test. Second period. And my dad is freaking out about it. If I don't pass the test I'm kicked off the basketball team. Why didn't you tell us this before? Because it's not your problem. It is now. We're also a team. And if we're quick we can stop Megabyte and get to Virusylum before second period starts. Okay? Okay, let's do it. Since speed is essential I have something that should help. A time space accelerator? No. I will activate individual vehicles for you, Enigma, and D-Frag. Not what I was thinking but way cooler. Absolutely! I'm totally down with an upgrade. Yeah. As long as it gets this done faster. Zip board! Googz, your quadra disc is ready. Quadra disc! Woo-hoo! Sweet! Woah... Enigma, all systems go for your stealth glider. Stealth glider! Woo-hoo! I like this! A lot! Your turn, D-Frag. I am providing you with state-of-the-art turbo jets. Turbo jets? I'm not so sure about this, Vera. Woah... Don't worry. They are equipped with stabilizers for maximum motion sickness prevention. Okay. Yeah, now you're talking. Woo! All right, guys. Let's kick some virus butt! Frag fists! Coming through. Hiya! My turn! Whew! Code disruptor! These stabilizers are awesome. I don't feel sick at all. Woah. Uh-oh. Look out, D-Frag. Thanks! So my little feline distraction didn't keep the guardians occupied as long as I anticipated. But they are too late. Bad news. Megabyte just smoked the second firewall. The security system has been disarmed. The entire building is vulnerable. Report to my office, both of you. You're mine now. Googz, Pogo needs some new firewalls. Enigma, you cover him. D-Frag, you and I will take Megabyte. Sounds like a plan. I'm taking you down, Megajerk! Such confidence. I will enjoy crushing it. Bash tagger. We'll be doing the crushing, Megatoggle. Firewall! - That's one. - Googz! Get down! Thanks! Alpha sentinels, alert the troops. Return to the fortress at once. Running away, Megachicken? Hardly. I've accomplished what I set out to do here. Woah! Until we meet again, guardians! I wonder what Megabyte meant about accomplishing what he set out to do. Yeah, those firewalls weren't down for very long. Who knows? That dude's pretty warped. Let's just get back in the codec and deliver the cat virus. Hey, wait for me! Let's go, kitty. I'm on a tight schedule. Ugh. Yuck. A digital fur ball. No, not a fur ball. Then what is it? No idea. Hey Vera, can you figure out what this is? Analysis of curious spherical object initiated. And while you're doing that, the four of us will take the cat to Virusylum. Change of plans. Just three of us. D-Frag's headed back to Room Zero. What're you talking about? You're on a tight schedule, remember? Second period's about to start. We can handle the drop-off. You've got a coding test to pass. Okay, thanks. Remember to end your statements with semi-colons. Got it. So that's Virusylum. I would not wanna be locked up in here. State your business. We've got a present for you. Virus detected. The Dis will accept your deposit. They don't mess around. No kidding. I hope D-Frag made it to his coding test. I just hope he passes. He's got a good chance if he remembers his semi-colons. - Googz. - What? They're really important. And now this breaking news bulletin. A shocking theft from Pogo Computer Systems has the tech world reeling. The thief, dubbed "the sorcerer", is being praised by the hacker community for the cyber attack that deactivated the building's security and allowed him to walk off with the Nova X3J prototype. The sorcerer's identity and whereabouts are unknown, and what he'll do now that he has the Nova X3J is anyone's guess. This Nova X3J. What's so special about it? Everything. It's Pogo's masterpiece. 30 cores, 60 threads, a monster cache. Unlimited speed, I mean, it has a 100,000 terabyte bandwidth. The catch is it can connect to the internet without Wi-Fi so if the sorcerer has it he can launch an untraceable attack from anywhere. So Megabyte's cat virus was only meant as a distraction. Yeah. Stealing the Nova X3J was the real plan all along. This sorcerer is bad news. And he's got Megabyte working with him. That's worse news. Hey, how'd the test go? Aced it. Yes! Thanks for the semi-colon tip, Parker. No problem. So you're still on the basketball team? Yeah, as long as I can keep up a B average. I have total faith in you. Thanks. It feels good not to let either team down. Or your dad. Yeah, that too. So Vera, any uh... Any luck figuring out what this thing is? I'm in the process of trying to decode it. It has a very unusual file format. So far none of the applications I have used have delivered a positive result. Bless you. Bless you. Vera? Yes? Is there a cat in here? This is Hashtag. My new pet. Vera, where did you get it? I found him outside the school. Vera, this cat's name is Duncan. This is somebody else's pet. You're gonna have to return him. Oh, all right. I'll do it. You crack open that sphere. I've got a feeling it's gonna be important somehow.
