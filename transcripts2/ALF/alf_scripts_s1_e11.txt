 Willie suggests that they go to San Diego on holiday. Kate is all for it, but there's a slight problem: what to do with ALF? Since leaving ALF alone is a recipe for disaster, the family takes him along for the road trip. However, the weather turns stormy, ALF gets bored of sitting in the RV and starts complaining. Willie goes mental and shows ALF the door. Defiantly, ALF wanders off.

about what we're gonna do on our vacation why is that the end of the hair talk because that's the end that's why we've changed subjects we're talking about our vacation I thought we decided San Diego it has something for everyone your mother and I I mean Kate and I have talked about this and we've decided we should all stay right here at the table but in the house or around the house around the house well we can go out outside did we get to cross the street instead of going somewhere far away and different it would be more fun to to stay home work where things are are not so different and do pretty much the same things we do every day I think you sold them they're no sale here I think it bites wind oh look that's not here talk let's just go back to this vacation thing right yeah I think we should talk about it how car not going anywhere did you lose all your money been playing the ponies haven't you if you want all the truth you're the reason we're staying home wah oui Monsieur pourquoi because you're an alien we're dropping the French were dropping at no problemo what can we do help to San Diego because the minute we check into a hotel somebody's gonna call the police or the National Enquirer and obviously we can't leave home alone you proved that today I suppose that's a reference to this kitchen thing you did start that fire and then you watch TV while Kate and I put it out I didn't think it was a three-man job the point is we're going to have to spend this vacation at home I feel terrible I ruined your stove now I'm ruining your vacation I'm worthless I'm

into the woods where nobody GL out of the mouths of babes we can rent a Motorhome we could go to some secluded camper that's a great idea let's give it a shot it could be fun singing songs around the campfire eating pork and beans out of a tin can being together 24 hours a day learning to accept each other's little idiosyncrasies so the kennel idea is dead okay we'll go camping what are we image we need pork and beans wolf [Applause] one more time I don't know the words hey Willie keep your eyes open for a clean gas station I'm gonna need to make a pit stop again I can't help it it's all this
