T's Christmas special and they tape in Burbank that was fake snow well that's it for Christmas Alf it is possible to have Christmas without snow I don't want to talk about it let's move on to New Year's mom I found another egg thank you got them all all but that one I swear here's one more and the one in the philodendron oh hi I'm sorry I'm late the box let me just explain it why are you holding eggs didn't you get a tree oh no I mean yes I I mean yes let's start with a simple question what's your name please let me try to explain this my way you see I went to every lot in town I found lots empty wats except one where this man named fuck he had just this one tree left so where is it he was auctioning it off to the highest bidder I dropped out when the price got to $100 oh my cried and we have no tree we have a tree we have a Christmas tree and it's right here behind the books it's in the box a fake tree it's a lifelike simulated tree yes what do you do just add water no we put it together together yeah it'll be a fun family project and it comes to the can of simulated snow if you'd gotten two cans we could have made a simulated snowman 125 what does that mean $125 that's the price it's my math way off or is that more than you would have paid the heat it's more but it's less I'm talking to Carnac it's more now but it will be less because you see this tree is guaranteed for 25 years now if you amortize that over the whole period that's just that's just five dollars a year so we're gonna be stuck with this thing for over a quarter of a century when you see it assemble it'll be fine you'll see I agree I think a fake tree is fine and I'm with Lynn it doesn't matter what kind of tree it is a tree is just a symbol right right what's a symbol he agrees well this whole thing stinks if you ask me nobody's asking you well I'm not waiting for an invitation first you drop the fake snow on me then you come waltzing in here with this miserable excuse for a tree may I remind you it was you who chopped up our real tree I knew you'd bring that up hey you want me to get rid of him how's that caroling then why are they singing well I don't see why not let's all go oh yeah sure let me just know you know what I want to stay here and and assemble the tree I'll catch up with you at the manger by the gas station I don't want you to miss the care I'm not gonna miss the caroling Oh No this tree isn't gonna take long to put together and then we'll all decorate when you get back ok bosz we'll see you there ok you're really gonna let Brian go caroling sure why not well I'm melmac caroling was definitely not for children how come well you'd have to know Carol [Music] excuse me would you mind some constructive criticism yes I would why don't you read the instructions they're in Japanese then I'll read them what does it say in English so you weren't able to buy a real tree just skip to the instruction part step 1 paint the trunk green paint not included let's see I'll be able to handle this myself alright pretend I'm not here just like I'm doing with that tree look at that 4 inches of snow and Clayton Georgia oh darn I'll have to tape it 12
