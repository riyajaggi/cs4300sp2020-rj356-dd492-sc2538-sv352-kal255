 Cass okay more for me you know it's a lucky thing I found these when I was cleaning out my spaceship a couple of more months and they would have gone bad oh well they're not that stale no lights are out roach well I think someone's been slacking off on our housekeeping it came from your bag well needless to say that's the last time I shop at Ed's bakery [Music] [Music] we're at the rusco it ran under the bag somebody step on it of course it does

 it's a roach now coaches don't have blue eyes they have I don't know what they have well on melmac their eyes are blue haven't you ever heard the expression her eyes were as blue as a roaches somebody just squash it wait a minute Kate this thing came all the way from melmac it's a unique specimen we already have a unique specimen from melmac you're comparing me to a cockroach spray answer me I wouldn't think it's Chantel it will be just as interesting dead do you have to kill it I mean couldn't you just I don't know like let it loose in the backyard no no here's what we should do we should catch it I'll build a little box we'll put a piece of donut right in the middle then you guys make sure that Alf doesn't get to the donut before the roach does then nevermind the box you mentioned something about a doughnut roaches are filthy disgusting creatures that carry disease I thought we were talking about doughnuts there is no doughnut Roger funeral we shouldn't bury it we should keep it for study I'm just curious what kind of doughnut would it have been plain plain what all the choices they have nowadays well you got me going ow we are trying to figure out what to do with the roach why it's gone what look it's not there anymore where did it go maybe then sprayed enough I use half a can I'll be right back where are you going I'm gonna call a donut place that delivers come on everybody we are gonna find that roach okay calm down calm down there is a space roach loose in our house well maybe it went somewhere to die with dignity Willie yeah all right al you can order the doughnuts I already did but that's not why I said oh why did you say just come out here what is all this secrecy about I didn't want to upset cake what is it that would upset Kate I believe a footlong cockroach would upset Kate old blue eyes is back come on you guys I told grandma we'd be at her place in 10 minutes I think you're missing the point of this trip just get packed please let's get in the car mom why do we have to take so much I mean we're coming back we are coming back aren't we yes when the cockroach is killed but it was killed before this time I want to see a body good news it's dead well let's just say it's got three feet in the grave the exterminators on his way over we don't need an exterminator we need Sigourney Weaver okay unpack your bags I'll cancel the exterminator I've killed the roads tell us how you killed the roach after my brother I can't how did you kill the roach hey use the spray did you actually see the body I saw it hit the floor and been mmm then I came in here so we're talking about an unconfirmed kill technically let's go kids come on wait Kate I emptied a whole can of spray on it I tell you it's dead you call me when you get to your mother's touch Willy let's go Kate you're not going anywhere that's your roach it was my roach when it was an inch lower now it belongs to the world stay right where you are I'll call you and the exterminator leave us goodbye honey fine be careful listen if it goes into my room I don't want to know about it bye out listen what's that exterminator plan to use on this thing I don't know spray hmm hmm what well maybe nothing but we started with a roach this big Kate sprayed it a minute later it was big enough to wear a sweater then you sprayed it again now I hate to extrapolate out what happened when you sprayed roaches on nomic we didn't have spray-on melmac which in retrospect seems like a pretty good thing what's it doing back there anything it wants to you you better hide in the kitchen oh great the one place roaches always go would you rather hide back there if you need me I'll be on top of the refrigerator exterminator oh right where are they in the bedroom but actually there aren't really all that many actually there's just one one rich just the one yes way some kind of phobic phobic yes all right I'll go kill the roach wait wait just a minute please you you can't use that spray why not because who knows what effect it will have on the roach well if history's any teacher the general effect will be death ideally yes but this is a special roach what is it hey don't use that spray fine I won't I don't believe you give me the tank what am i shooting so don't step on it I was hoping you might be able to suggest some more scientific way to kill oh I'm sorry I left my heat-seeking missile in the car oh now you're making fun of me yes I am I'll just take a magazine whack oh wait wait take this instead [Laughter] did you warn them yeah when I I don't think he'd believe me maybe you better open the front door hi I've gotta see this for myself you want me to hold the door open how big did it get well that depends do you measure at the shoulder or the head [Music] let's go Willie we're all packed and I started the car we're not running away from this roach you didn't hear me I said we're driving away from this Roach I'm not giving up I'm gonna find something to kill it well may I suggest the National Guard I'd prefer a method that would keep us off the six o'clock news all right I'll see you later d stands for drive right Alf look panicking is not gonna help anything all right let's just sit around and read this is not reading this is research I'm going to solve this problem with a calm clinical approach that's exactly what those guys in Detroit said then one morning they woke up and found themselves infested with Jaffee's Jaffee's yeah blood sucking maggots that take the shape of their host detroit michigan you amaze me you think that's the only detroit in the universe where's the other one on melmac a lot of good Rd groups came out of there thank you thank you but if we could stick to the problem we're supposed to be finding a way to kill roaches I thought of one but you didn't like it I don't have a harpoon whose fault is that I mean you can't expect me to take care of everything I think I may have discovered a less violent solution now all these books say that the best way to kill roaches is with boric acid oh yeah that's what they used on the Jaffee's but did it work let's put it this way Detroit became known as Jaffe town maybe they didn't have the right concentration fortunately I have access to all the latest scientific research McCall's they did an article on poison okay else under the counter it's crawling with spiders back there who well can I at least take something to read Steve Allen's world of bugs great I've already read it hi Tana hi Trevor I saw the exterminator leave your house in such a hurry he dropped his tank bugs oh yeah we have a little cockroach problem ah yeah cockroaches but Litella germanica a little prehistoric friend you know cockroach fossils have been found that are over 300 million years old that's Nystrom I'll never forget the cockroach problem we had back in Korea they were everywhere you took a step it was like walking on crackers isn't that interesting there's more I'm sorry please go on we used to have to go to sleep with our boots on because you know the oriental ones when they bite they secrete this weird saliva kind of like meat tenderizer good enough for that in your system forget it they showed us a movie about it David Niven was brilliant well I'll see ya oh by the way I took the liberty of spraying around your house you what yeah I noticed the exterminator forgot to do it so I posted up for you real good no charge [Music] I said no charge [Music] where are you going oh I'm going to the drugstore I'm gonna buy all the boric acid the gut what you heard Trevor what if you come back and I've been tenderized I won't be gone wrong how long they'll be gone five minutes take me with you you know I can't well throw me in the trunk there's no air good suffocate oh we're scuba gear give me 30 minutes plus if you drive off the bridge I'll survive I haven't got time to argue all right go burst Kate and the kids now you I feel like the pretty little virgin look the one you know the apple-cheeked maiden that the cowardly townspeople feed to the dragon don't you read fairy tales this is a discussion that we're going to postpone I'm leaving it fine I'll just toddle off into the kitchen and saute myself Alf you know I wouldn't leave you if I hadn't have a choice then hug me what I want a hook why well because we may never see each other again and we've never taken the time to you know hug now tell me you love me all right all right just hurry back okay and don't stop for anything Oh except maybe some more doughnuts generally all right I should take it easy I mean the only thing we have to fear is fear itself whoever said that must have had a lot of bodyguards be strong be strong be afraid be very afraid listen me I'm pure gristle my whole family has an aftertaste if you can hold out there's Donuts on the way good idea put some coffee on it I should have guessed it probably likes gristle now I feel like a tease hello operator this is an emergency give me the fire department or the police or the paramedics somebody I don't care you decide hello fire department ah well I need you to come out here there's a giant cockroach trying to kill me all right then I'm a cat and I'm stuck in a tree whatever it takes [Music] whoever builds the doors on this planet ought to be horsewhipped occupied all right the party's over I've got a 357 and I know how to use it no one's ever told me where these things lead oh you want to use the bathroom is that it hey hey I know the feeling [Music] you're angry at the world I understand that uh you probably didn't get enough blow as a larva we could sit down talk have a nice cold glass of boric acid you know you can deal with it what do you think about that ever see one of these [Music] Joe yeah of a good psychiatrist friend of mine he he deals with psychopathic [Music] alpha you okay oh hi Willie did you get the doughnuts what did you do nothing much watched a little TV kill the bug how did you kill it cheap cologne let's try fume I bought that for Kate on her last birthday you had Roche problems then - how did you know to use this well I analyzed the list of ingredients and based on what I know about the physiology of Mel Maki and cockroaches Alf I lucked out I can't believe you took this roach on all by yourself you could have been killed when it comes to defending my home I'm an animal that's just the way on me I don't know I'm gonna drag this outside before Kate gets back no don't rough it up once they dry out they get brittle what difference does that make are you kidding I plan to have that guy stuffed and mounted ASAP I thought it would look good over the fireplace we're getting rid of it hello oh hi Kate I was just about to call you I've got some good news about the roach and some bad news about your birthday present [Music] hey Brian how about a bedtime story I'm too tired to tell you one tonight no I'll tell you one okay what do you want to hear Bob are the elephant The Princess and the pea or brave Alf and the giant cockroach I'll go with the princess why read it yourself what you do it's a cockroach we found a dump that doesn't ask questions so now they don't give a prize for the weirdest garbage now did you check your spaceship see if there are any more cockroaches consider it roach las' but you you sprayed everything with perfume just in case well everything but my gym bag I don't want to get funny looks if I ever go back to my health club what is this plant looks kind of like a Venus flytrap it is from Venus I want that out of this house why it's just a plant it brightens up the room gives off oxygen it eats insects and pencils I'll get the perfume I'll call and see if the duck is still open I'll take back the boric acid get some dick folium if people are getting good at this [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
