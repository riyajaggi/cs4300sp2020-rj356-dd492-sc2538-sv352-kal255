 How awesome is Maya Fleishacker?
 She's cute, she's smart,
 and she's got a purple belt in kickboxing.
 I have a purple belt.
 But you keep telling me not to wear it.
 Wait. She's finally alone.
 Now's my chance to talk to her. What should I say?
 For someone like Maya Fleishacker,
 you gotta be sophisticated... grown-up.
 Ooh, ask her if she read Fifty Shades of Grey.
 - What's that? - Some book my mom really liked.
 She even read it in the bathtub.
 I'll give it a shot.
 What's the worst that could happen?
 Hey, Maya.
 How about that Fifty Shades of Grey?
 What?
 Uh...it's my favorite book.
 It's, um... it's very grown-up.
 It's about a painter
 who, uh, uh...
 who loves the color gray,
 and, uh, I... it's really sophisticated,
 and I read it when I take my bath.
 Wait, I just...
 Don't worry. One day, you'll laugh at this
 as hard as everyone else is.
 Oh, hey, Terry. How are...
 So...
 didn't we already have the flag discussion?
 Oh, I thought that was about the size,
 which I totally agree with.
 The other one took half an hour
 to fold every night.
 Okay, I don't know whether to yell at you
 - or salute. - That's funny.
 You're not the first person to say that to me.
 Funny, yeah. Well, here's hoping
 I'm the last.
 Hey there, neighbor!
 Wanna hang out a bit and rap with your old Uncle Terry?
 I got some, uh, cold hot wings and warm iced tea.
 Know how to get a jigsaw blade unstuck from a shop class wall?
 No, I do not.
 Then no, thanks, but no, thanks.
 Ah, hey there, neighbor!
 Oh, your shirt's a little torn.
 Stee-rike two.
 Mm, sorry.
 These rutabaga chips are putting up a heck of a fight.
 These bills are killing me.
 Oh, and this one is actually threatening me.
 So looks like we're changing dentists again.
 You're not alone in this, Beth.
 Everybody's having to tighten their belt.
 Even George Clooney is noodling with flying commercial.
 Wait, this can't be right.
 There's no way that Patrick had a gym membership.
 Yeah, neither of my boys were...
 traditional athletes.
 Terry was really good at hide-and-seek,
 but to be fair, I-I usually took a nap before looking.
 I got some rest, and he felt
 like a champion hider.
 Win-win.
 Here.
 What?
 Wyatt, I just bought this shirt for you.
 What happened?
 Who cares what happened?
 It's just a stupid shirt.
 Hey, don't talk to me like that, young man.
 Great, no matter what I say, it's gonna be wrong.
 So maybe I shouldn't say anything at all.
 Wha...are you serious?
 Okay.
 If you want it that way...
 Here.
 What just happened?
 - Maybe I can help a little. -
 You think I should talk to him or...
 - wait until... - Oh, oh, no.
 I'm not dancing through that field of cow patties.
 No, I meant, uh, maybe I could call the gym
 and figure out how to get a refund.
 You know what? I'll take it.
 Are you kidding me?
 Who ordered Cage Fighting Championships
 on pay-per-view?
 Oh, those darn kids, right?
 You know, I'm gonna go
 fix that gym thing right now.
 Hey, Uncle Terry. What's up?
 Uh, just losing at solitaire, which,
 technically, must mean I'm also winning,
 'cause I'm beating myself.
 I was just wondering if
 you wanted to play some football.
 What, are you kidding me? I've been waiting here for weeks
 for one of you squirts to wanna do something with old Uncle T.
 Yeah, well, Liam and Wyatt don't want to,
 and all of my friends are busy, so...
 No need to beg.
 I'd love to toss around the old pigskin with you.
 Just let me slip out of these flip-flops
 and into my sport Crocs.
 Uh, you...you can stay in your flip-flops.
 I meant video football.
 uh, I'm not much of a, uh, video gamer.
 Uh, the last one I played wasMs. Pac-Manat my old job.
 But...wait, you had a job?
 Are you kidding? I've had hundreds of them.
 How do you feel about cold hot wings?
 I feel angry that they're not already in my mouth.
 I'm having the worst day ever.
 I just got in a fight with Mom...
 I don't have time for your childish problems.
 The skateboard I'm making doesn't look
 remotely skateboard-y.
 It kind of looks like it might be a skateboard.
 Someday.
 Well, someday better be Friday,
 or I'm getting an F in shop.
 Why should I even have to do this?
 Working with my hands is not my destiny.
 This hand is for signing checks.
 And this hand is for cashing them.
 Okay, but seriously, about Mom. What should I...
 See, Wyatt, this is your problem.
 You have no empathy for other people's feelings.
 It's really pretty sad.
 By the way, I heard you epically flamed out
 at school trying to talk to a girl.
 Smooth move.
 You heard about that?
 Dude, everyone has.
 I've already downloaded two GIFs of it.
 Take a little advice from someone older
 and more sophisticated than you.
 All girls really care about is what's in here.
 My heart?
 No, you dork.
 That's where you keep your slim-line wallet
 when you wear a $3,000 suit.
 career comes first.
 You have to make at least $2 million
 so if you get divorced, you're still a millionaire.
 Got it?
 Not...really.
 it's impossible to communicate with women,
 so why bother trying?
 Welcome aboard, bubblehead.
 That's submarine-speak for "howdy, sailor."
 What's that noise?
 It sounds like Uncle Terry when he tries to beatbox.
 That, son, would be Morse code.
 It's kind of like old-fashioned texting,
 - only without the emojis. - No emojis?
 How are you supposed to send a smiley face?
 Uh, dot-dot-dot, dot, dash, dot, dot, dash, d...
 well, yeah, that would really take a long time, actually.
 - - I understand that
 about as well as I understand talking to Maya.
 Ah, talking with a girl.
 The noblest form of communication.
 Not when you have no idea what to say.
 Well, communication isn't always easy.
 But there's always a way.
 Look at us.
 500 feet below the ocean's surface
 and we can still talk to people.
 - It is pretty cool. -
 The enemy's approaching! Man your station, sailor.
 We've gotta make our move.
 - - D-seven.
 Hit!
 You sank my battleship.
 Yes! All right.
 Incidentally, did you know
 the fist bump was invented on submarines
 'cause the ceilings are too low to high-five?
 That's great, Dad, but...
 how does that help me know how to talk to Maya?
 It doesn't. But the book does.
 Everything you need to know is in that book.
 Take a look.
 Aye, aye, Captain!
 "Captain." I like that.
 You can call me Captain.
 Or "my liege."
 Whichever comes more naturally.
 What? "Sun."
 That's it?
 How is that everything I need to know?
 Strikers really need...
 Heads up, I'm going to the end zone!
 Oh, yeah? That's what you think,
 'cause I'm gonna... hang on, which...
 which button is the "run"
 And which...hang on, which one is my guy again?
 You're the guy over there running in circles
 next to the cheerleaders.
 Aw, yeah, Video Terry's got game.
 Uh, excuse me, ladies, I can't chat right now.
 I've gotta X, O...
 Touchdown!
 Boom!
 Dude, nice move!
 Hey, and...and second place, not so bad either.
 That is a silver medal in the Olympics.
 Hanging with you is so fun, Uncle Terry.
 You know, what do you say we do a rematch?
 Well, I can't feel my thumbs from scoring on you so much,
 so maybe this time won't be a total domination.
 Wait a minute...
 That'll help.
 Hey, that's an interesting outfit.
 - You going to a bullfight? - Close.
 I'm going flamenco dancing tonight.
 when in Andalusia...
 No, nobody says that.
 Um, hey, have you talked to Wyatt?
 He hasn't said a word to me all day.
 Don't complain. Terry talked to me
 for half an hour straight this morning,
 and that was through the bathroom door.
 Okay, never mind.
 Um, oh, what about the gym thing?
 Did you get that straightened out?
 Yep, went down there and took care of everything.
 That crappy membership is a thing of the past.
 Oh, thank God.
 I got us upgraded to the premium membership
 with full pool and sauna privileges.
 Hmm.
 Oh, shoot.
 I got up-sold, didn't I? I...
 In my defense,
 Jean-Claude at the front desk
 is one silver-tongued Adonis.
 It was one simple thing, Tiffany,
 that you volunteered to do for me.
 Well, I guess we both learned our lesson, didn't we?
 - Hey. - Hey, Wyatt.
 How's it going, tiger?
 Uh, uh...good.
 Great, uh... everything's...great.
 Tiffany...can I ask you for some advice?
 Only if you want an awesome answer.
 I do.
 There's this girl in my class
 that I really like, but...
 I don't know what to do about it.
 Oh, honey.
 You're sweet and sensitive and cute as a button.
 But I'm not gonna lie to you.
 If you want any shot with the ladies,
 you gotta be in a rock band.
 Lead singer, guitarist, drummer, it...
 pretty much anything except the keyboard player.
 They always put the nerd on keys.
 Okay.
 - Thanks. - Just remember, Wyatt,
 you can't always get what you want.
 But if you try sometimes,
 you just might find...
 you get what you need.
 How long do you think it would take me
 to learn a musical instrument?
 Tiffany said it's my only shot.
 Well, I've taken oboe lessons since I was six.
 Can you play any cool rock songs?
 I can play the tune that makes a cobra come out of a basket.
 My little sister thinks it's cool,
 but she also thinks balloon unicorns are cool.
 She calls them "balloon-icorns."
 Your sister sounds kind of...
 Hey, what time is band practice?
 You know, for our band?
 Well...I could do any time,
 00.
 - There is no band, Sam. - Fine.
 30,
 but you'll have to talk to my mom.
 There's the offense going right,
 but the defense...
 Hey, little buddy!
 Game's all set and ready to rock.
 I have been practicing all day
 and listening to Jock Jams... so I'm pumped.
 No, thanks, Uncle Terry.
 That game's gotten kind of boring.
 The new version is way better.
 When you sack the quarterback,
 you can actually rip out his spine
 and dance around with it.
 I do like to dance.
 Yeah, it's pretty sweet,
 except it's 60 bucks.
 60 bucks?
 That's a bargain! Where else are you gonna
 be able to rip out somebody's spine
 and dance around with it for that kind of money?
 That's exactly what I said!
 Okay, you know what? The parking tickets can wait.
 I am buying us that game!
 - Awesome! - Yeah!
 Okay, wait. Ah, let's try that again.
 Bring it in slow. I'm gonna practice that too.
 Broke a heel last night.
 Apparently flamenco and sangria are bad dance partners.
 This whole assignment is idiotic!
 Need a little help?
 Did Bill Gates need help from his grandmother
 when he built his empire?
 No clue. I'm a Mac gal.
 I wish Dad were here.
 He'd understand.
 I know, honey.
 I know.
 We all miss him.
 And where do you think he learned to build stuff, huh?
 Scooch on over, John-Boy.
 From stilettos to kitten heels.
 How the heck did you...
 You know what?
 If it means that much to you to help me,
 then it'd be selfish of me not to let you.
 If you're asking for my help, honey...
 you gotta do it the right way.
 Fine.
 Tiffany...
 ...would you please help me?
 Sure.
 But as your buddy Bill Gates would probably say,
 it's gonna cost you.
 And, uh...let's keep this our secret.
 Last thing I need is for people around here
 to know I can do stuff.
 Okay, let's do that.
 Hi, I'm here to cancel a gym membership.
 You must be Jean-Claude.
 Yes, uh, and your name is?
 Don't bother, okay?
 Because I'm not gonna fall for your sweet talk,
 and I won't be up-sold, and I'm not gonna be tricked
 into any "special deals," okay? I'm here to cancel a membership
 and that's it. Got it?
 Yes, no problem.
 See, no...see, no, no, no, no.
 No, no, 'cause I am not falling for whatever...you're doing.
 What are you doing?
 Uh, the name of the membership you want to cancel?
 Patrick McKenna.
 Okay, and don't tell me that it's un-refundable
 or talk me into transferring...
 You're Patrick's wife.
 - Uh... - I'm so sorry.
 He was a wonderful man.
 Wait, you-you knew him?
 So he...he was coming here?
 He was training here for almost a year.
 It was supposed to be a surprise.
 A surprise for who?
 For you.
 He wanted to be able to run a half marathon with you.
 He told me how much you loved to run and...
 he wanted to be a part of something that you loved.
 And then he...
 And then he got sick.
 Yeah, I haven't run since then.
 I'll, uh...I'll cancel his account right now.
 Thank you for...for being so understanding.
 And I'm...you know, I'm really sorry that I misjudged you.
 It is, uh... how you say, uh...
 no big deal.
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 Dude.
 Why'd I let her off the hook?
 I'm this close to that Jet Ski.
 Hey, Uncle Terry. Thanks for the new game.
 It is awesome!
 ...the 40-yard line!
 He's not gonna get up anytime soon.
 Oh, yeah.
 Hey, I-I kinda thought the two of us, you know, were gonna...
 It even has a decapitation mode
 that if you hit the quarterback hard enough,
 its head flies off, and you can kick it
 into the stands!
 See? Boom! Yeah!
 - There goes your head! - That should be my head.
 It doesn't make any sense.
 Wait.
 "Just be yourself, son."
 Welcome back, submariner.
 I've been waiting for you.
 I cracked your code, Dad.
 But all it said was "just be yourself."
 There's no way that would ever work.
 Communication can be challenging, Wyatt.
 Sometimes it's hard work.
 That's why I used the invisible ink--
 to make you dig a little deeper.
 But I did work hard.
 Now I think it's too late.
 I totally humiliated myself in front of Maya
 because I listened to what everyone else was saying.
 It's never too late, son,
 as long as you're honest and you're open
 and you share what's really in your heart.
 What if I don't know what that is?
 Hey, look, I'm good, but for the really tricky stuff,
 you gotta talk to the master.
 Down, periscope!
 Pretty cool, huh? Take a look.
 Mom?
 You know anyone with a bigger heart than hers?
 I sure don't.
 What do you think
 Yell "up, periscope."
 I'd love to, but I kind of
 have something really important I have to do.
 Aw, what the heck? Up, periscope!
 Never gets old.
 I'm sorry for yelling at you, Mom.
 I was having a terrible day and I took it out on you.
 And then I got stuck being mad,
 even when I didn't wanna be anymore.
 Sweetheart.
 I'm sorry too.
 Okay? It was a silly shirt.
 And I was caught up in my own nonsense
 and I should not have let it go on like that.
 So...friends again?
 Wyatt, we'll always be friends.
 Let's make a deal, okay?
 Next time we feel like not talking to each other,
 let's...
 ...let's definitely talk about that.
 Okay. Deal.
 You're going jogging?
 You haven't done that in a long time.
 I know. And it's gonna be great
 to get out there again. It'll be good for me...
 in a lot of ways.
 Uh, cool. Now that we're talking again
 and you're, like,
 the smartest person that I know...
 Agreed, mm-hmm.
 ...I need some advice.
 Okay.
 There's this girl...
 that I kind of like.
 Mm-hmm.
 And I'm still not sure
 what to say to her.
 Okay. Um...well...
 I still remember the first words your father said to me.
 Really?
 What were they?
 I was a freshman.
 And I was checking out all the cool stuff
 at an engineering fair on campus
 when up walks this super cute and kind of awkward fella.
 And he looks me in the eyes
 and he says, "Hey, miss.
 You ever arm-wrestled a robot?"
 And that was it. I was hooked.
 That's great, Mom, but... I can't say that.
 No, of course not, silly. That line is pure Patrick.
 See, you...you have to show her pure Wyatt.
 And it's really not that big of a deal.
 You just talk to her about what interests you these days.
 Okay.
 Thanks, Mom.
 So...did you beat the robot?
 What do you think?
 Look at these guns!
 These will not be defeated.
 I'll take that as a yes.
 Hey, Maya.
 Wanna learn how to say your name in Morse code?
 Uh...not really.
 No, no, no, it's...it's cool,
 'cause it's actually pretty easy.
 It's just...dash-dash... dot-dash...
 No, no, I have to hit it harder.
 Dash-dash, dot-dash, dash...
 It's...it all starts with D, so, uh, dash, dot...
 uh, no, no, no. Dosh, dat...
 You're, like...super weird.
 Dot-dot-dot-dot,
 dot-dot.
 - What? - That's Morse code for "hi."
 My grandpa taught me that. He was in the navy.
 Oh. My dad was the captain
 of a submarine... ...kind of.
 That's really cool, Wyatt.
 You...know my name?
 Yeah, I do. I'm Natalie.
 See you around.
 Wow.
 Of course.
 Everyone sees me rip my shirt off,
 but no one sees that.
 Mm.
 Oh, hey, hey, hey.
 Go easy on piggy number seven.
 She's more ticklish than the rest.
 Just get in there with your hands.
 I'm starting to think that an F wouldn't be so bad.
 Hi.
 - Is Liam being punished? -
 I'm not sure, but it's nice to see them bonding...
 and buffing. So?
 How'd it go with the girl?
 - Hmm? - Horrible.
 But then pretty awesome.
 What? Hold it, mister, I want details!
 Remember? We agreed to talk!
 - - Enter.
 Oh. It's you.
 Wanna play some football?
 Oh, no, thanks.
 I'm in a meeting.
 Are you sure?
 You said you liked the real thing.
 Look...
 so I'm really, uh...
 I'm, uh...you know...
 Uncle Terry.
 I'd rather rip off your quarterback's head
 than anyone else's.
 You're not just saying that to make me feel better?
 No way.
 Wow.
 That's the sweetest apology I ever almost got.
 - So you'll play
 Get ready to have your head ripped off
 by one of my bullet spirals!
 Hang on.
 Super cold hot wing for the road?
 Best uncle ever!
 Duh!
 All right, Uncle Terry, let's see what you got.
 Brace yourself for the beauty, little man.
 Come on, you gotta dive!
 You gotta dive for those. Not gonna walk to you.
 Okay, that one got away from me a little bit.
 - Little bit, little bit. - Ball is probably wet
 or something, you know?
 Comin' in hot.
 All right, toss me another one.
 We'll stay out here until you get the hang of it.
 Mom, looking good.
 Aw, thank you. Yeah, I forgot
 how much running relaxes me.
 All right.
 Yep. Nothing more soothing than a good jog.
 Hey, Beth. Hey, Beth. B...
 All right, Dash. Let's face the mus...
 Dash?
 Hey!
 Who broke my window?
