 My name is Michael Westen. I used to be a spy until-- - [ Man ] We got a burn notice on you. You're blacklisted. - [ Whistles ] [ Michael Narrating ] When you're burned, you've got nothing-- no cash, no credit, no job history. - You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in. - Where am I? Miami. You do whatever work comes your way. - You rely on anyone who's still talking to you-- - [ Laughs ] - a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend-- - Should we shoot them? an old friend who used to inform on you to the F.B.I.--

 You know spies. Bunch of bitchy little girls. - Family too-- - Hey, is that your mom again? - if you're desperate. - Someone needs your help, Michael. Bottom line: Until you figure out who burned you, you're not going anywhere. [ Michael Narrating ] When meeting a covert operative for the first time, the arrangements can tell you a lot. If they give you a map and a photo, they trust you. A place and a time-- they want to check you out before they make contact. A cryptic clue like "tidy pelican"-- they've just got an irritating sense of humor. [ Timers Ticking, Beeping ] [ Woman ] You're not gonna win. [ Boy ] Go.

 Next time, then. You look like you could use a partner. "Tidy pelican." Cute. Carla wanted to leave a harder clue for the crossword. You know how she loves these things. But I was worried it'd go right over your head. Love the shirt. Careful. The last man who insulted me had to fish pieces of his tongue out of a garbage disposal. [ Laughs ] I'm kidding. Sit. Don't worry. It's a nice, public place. We're just two guys talking, sport. Call me Victor. So what exactly do you do, Victor? You could think of me as a wrangler. I make sure the broncos don't buck too much, wander from the pen. That kind of thing. Like a rodeo clown. [ Chuckling ] Oh. You've been a busy boy, Michael-- sneaking around town, breaking into people's offices. Tsk, tsk, tsk. You've shown a lot of initiative. I've had a lot of time on my hands. We'd like to put your talents back to good use. We've got a little operation, and you're gonna help. And if I'm not interested? Then I suppose we turn the screws until you get interested. My advice is don't make this more difficult than it has to be. Meet your new best friend. This stays with you at all times. I call, you answer. And, no-- no, you do not get a return number. You know, I already have plenty of these things. And I'm not doing a job until I hear what it is. [ Michael Narrating ] Sometimes, when you meet a new operative, it's a good idea to open with an aggressive move. I'm sorry. That's not how it works. You learn about people when you make them play defense-- their reflexes, weaknesses, how they handle themselves under pressure. Keep smiling, sport. Just two guys talking. You'll tell me about your bosses, or I open your radial artery. My guess is you'll tap out in a minute, maybe two. Mmm. Carla said you might be difficult. See, Mikey, the people we work for, they're into the whole "carrot and stick" thing, and... I'm the stick. [ Gun Cocks ] .22-- it does some nasty things up close. It'll probably tumble around your femoral artery, your, uh-- your groin. Now, I'm no expert, but, uh, my guess is you tap out first. [ Michael Narrating ] And even if they're able to counter, it never hurts to know how far they're willing to go. ** [ Man Singing Reggae, Indistinct ] New car, Sam? [ Chuckles ] Pre-owned. After the breakup, Veronica took the Caddy back, so I used some saved-up pension checks and bought this baby. It was tough, but me and the Buick, we're gonna get through it. How'd your little spy meet go? Seems the folks that burned me want me for a new errand. If the operative they sent is any indication, it's-- it's heavy. And if you take a rain check? Oh, the usual. They'll work their way through my friends and family with a nine-millimeter... until I change my mind. Sam, this, uh-- This could get bad. I need someone to go stay over at my mom's, just until I figure out what's going on. I wouldn't ask unless it was serious. Serious, like "don't finish that beer" serious? Or "go over there right after you're done"-- [ Beeping ] Hey, Madeline. It's Sam Axe. Oh, I'm okay. You know, I've been staying over at Mike's place... ever since Veronica and I broke up. And, well, he's getting tired of me moping around, and I just wanted to know if I could stay at your place for... just a couple of days while I'm on the mend. Aw, thanks, Madeline. Yeah, Mike wants to talk to you. Hey, Mom. What are we up to here, friend? Whoa! Dude! Little surveillance? Planting a bug? - Something more exotic maybe. - What are you talking about? I came to talk to Michael. - I am a friend of the family. - Mm-hmm. On your feet. [ Madeline ] I found the old V.C.R. in the attic. It's good as new. Just have to hook up these little things in the back. Madeline, there you are. Hey. Ricky, you met Sam. Oh, yeah. We just had the pleasure. Ricky's older brother, Andre, used to get in more trouble with Michael. They were like Frick and Frack. Weren't they, honey? Yes, they were, Mrs. Westen. [ Chuckling ] How about that, huh? Ricky came by to see Michael, but he was kind enough... to help me install my home theater system. - So, how's it comin', Ricky? - Well, actually, I think it's time to upgrade. Really? It's a perfectly good machine. Sam, what's this? Well, he was at your ma's house when I got there. Michael, you remember Ricky. Ricky. Ricky Watkins. Yeah. Long time, right? I heard you were back in town. Looking good, man. What's Andre up to? - Twenty-five to life up in Starke. - That's too bad. Ricky thought it'd be fun for the two of you to catch up. - We've gotta get to that store. - Oh, that V.C.R. situation. That's right. Righty-o. Wow. We gotta do that. What, you gonna-- We gotta pick this thing up. A little shoppin'. [ Madeline ] You boys have fun, okay? How you been, Ricky? Oh, man, you wouldn't believe it. You probably remember me as that little screw-up kid, tryin' to raise hell like you and Andre used to. It's not like that anymore. Put myself through school, got a business degree. Head accountant, Sweet Valentine Enterprises. You know Valentine? The hip-hop mogul? Uh, the radio in my car is broken, so-- Trust me, it's big. The thing is, other day, Valentine calls me into his office, tells me there's two million missing from a charity account. I said it must be a mistake and I'll look into it. Money's gone. My name's on all the records. I'm being set up, man. You have any idea who might be behind it? Eddie Ash-- Valentine's number two. Only other cat with access to the accounts. He's been with Valentine since the beginning. He's the only guy Valentine really trusts. If I say anything, I'm dead. Dead? That a figure of speech? Valentine started as a gangster. If he thinks I'm stealing from him-- Nah, I wouldn't last 15 minutes. What you need, Ricky, is a forensic accountant. What I need is Eddie's books, okay? If I get the records, I give 'em to Valentine-- I'm in the clear. Eddie keeps 'em locked up in his office. And you want me to go in there and get it? Look-- [ Sighs ] I got $10,000 here. That's everything I got, and you can have it. Let's see how the job goes first, all right? [ Fiona ] You've really never heard of Valentine? Haven't had a lot of time for musical exploration, Fi. He has a clothing line too. Lingerie, wonderful shoes. - How much you payin' me for this again? - Bought you the espresso. Mm-hmm. - [ Man Rapping ] * The man, the man, the man * - [ Man #2 ] Deal you X. * I'm-a bat you around * * Yeah * * I wanna bat you around * * I'm-a bat you around * * Yeah * * I wanna bat you around * * I'm-a bat you around * ** [ Women Vocalizing ] * I wanna bat you around * * I'm-a bat you around * * I wanna bat you around * * I'm-a bat you around * * I'm so bad * * I wanna bat you around * * I'm-a bat you around * * I wanna bat you around * * I'm-a bat you around ** * I'm so bad ** That's Eddie. Not a bad way to travel, huh? We have to figure out how we can get in, check out his security. [ Cell Phone Ringing, Beeps ] Ricky said-- Yeah. [ Victor ] Hollywood Beach-- 15 minutes. [ Beeps ] Your new friend? Chatty, isn't he? I'm gonna have to take care of this. Can you-- Run along. Okay. Class is in session. Now listen carefully. I'm only gonna say this once. There is a certain location. And from this location, an item is being shipped to another location. Whoa. Slow down. Something is being shipped from somewhere to somewhere else. I think I follow. Now, we're going to hijack the something. What's the something? Oh, dear. Sounds like someone's got a case of the "need to knows." Left untreated, that could prove fatal, Michael. Dismissed. Traffic is brutal this time of day. You should probably hustle if you're headed back to, uh-- [ Beeps ] Biscayne Boulevard. [ Michael Narrating ] You can use cell phone towers... to triangulate the position of someone's cell phone, but you're going to have problems anytime they go out of range. Use an enhanced G.P.S., on the other hand, and you can pinpoint their location in real time... almost anywhere on the face of the planet. Try disconnecting a G.P.S. wired into a phone's motherboard, you risk disabling the phone. A much simpler solution is call forwarding. Ricky's getting us the security code, [ Beeping ] so that should take care of the doors. There are cameras all around the building though. What kind of cameras? Wireless. Nothing too hard to handle. Of course, the tactical support I'm giving you will cost you. I need new shoes. You've got plenty of shoes. Now that I'm on the open market, I need more. - [ Sirens Blaring ] - [ Man ] Go! Go! Come on, man! [ Michael Narrating ] If you want to empty a building, pulling a fire alarm is useless. No one pays attention unless they're actually on fire. A bomb scare next door to your target strikes the right balance. Everyone clears out and then pays attention to the other building. Impressive, Fi. What did you tell them? That I was a disgruntled customer, disgruntled enough to hide a remote-activated explosives device in the ladies' room. They're evacuating the entire block before they look for it. Bye. [ Michael Narrating ] Most modern bomb squads are equipped with an R.F. jammer. It blocks a wide spectrum of radio frequencies, preventing people from detonating bombs by remote control. It'll block all electronic transmissions in the area-- cell phones, for example-- - [ Siren Wailing In Distance ] - or wireless security cameras. [ Beeping ] The interior locks in an office suite are usually low-end-- just there to keep white-collar workers from stealing coffee cups. File cabinet locking bars, on the other hand, are a more serious security measure. Their main vulnerability is that they depend on people's faith in padlocks. People have too much faith in padlocks. [ Shutter Clicking ] [ Siren Wailing ] [ Horns Blaring ] [ Loud Chatter ] Hey! Hey! Why the hell you out here? The cops said we had to leave. There's a bomb in the building. I don't care if there's a mushroom cloud. You're paid to guard the building. Now get your asses in there and guard it. Now! - [ Clatter ] - Y'all hear that? [ Man #2 ] Yeah. What was that? Think it came from in here. [ Michael Narrating ] Air ducts in a modern office are 18 inches wide. So if you need to make a quick escape and you're older than four, you won't fit. A more viable option is the subceiling. Once you're in the subceiling, you can get to a bathroom or closet... and make your way out from there. [ People Chattering ] Uh-uh. This-- This can't be right, man. There was nothing in the files? - You sure you looked everywhere? - I'm sure, Ricky. Valentine is asking questions. I don't think I can hold him off much longer. Eddie has a prospectus for a tanning salon. He's got another for a car wash. He's shopping for a way to launder his money. He did a pretty good job of making it look like you stole the money. But if he suddenly has two million dollars in his bank account-- - People are gonna ask questions. - Exactly. He's looking for a front business-- a way to make it look like he actually earned this money. So he needs to clean his money. How does that help me? I'm gonna talk to Eddie. I'm gonna convince him he should wash his money with me. And that is something you can take to Valentine. Okay. I just want an introduction, Barry. Chances are good that this guy, Eddie, is talking to friends of yours. I just want to make my pitch. The next day, you do the Michael Westen thing. Stuff starts exploding, and everyone's saying, "Hey, Barry, wasn't that guy a friend of yours?" Sorry. No can do. Sam's working up a cover I.D. for me. I'm just a guy from out of town, a friend of a friend. The blow won't get back on you. I give you my word. I guess I could work it through some intermediaries. Yes. Doable. Yes. Expensive. How much? To get someone to vouch for you, put you in the room with the guy-- say five grand. Promise nothin' will happen to him, maybe I can do three. Five it is. Okay. Oh, Mike. Good timing. Check this out. Madras curry. Just take a little bit. Little sippy sip. Mmm! Huh? Your mom's got me into these cooking shows. It's addictive as hell. Oh. Mmm. [ Whispering ] How's the "protecting her from danger" show? Mmm. I do a perimeter check once an hour. I just say that I need some alone time to ponder the whole Veronica thing. Works like a charm. - What are you boys whispering about? - Nothing, Mom. Okay. Sam, did you get a chance to do that cover I.D. for me? You're Jimmy Glynn-- flashy real estate developer/ cash churner. I threw in some vague Boston mob connections just for good measure. What did I do-- Oh. Here we are. Here's your business card. You're all set, brother. ** [ Man Rapping, Indistinct ] ** [ Continues ] [ Michael Narrating ] When you're working a target, it's all about getting a good read. What makes him tick? Is he insecure? Does he have something to prove? You might only have a few seconds-- What up? but it all factors into your approach. - Eddie Ash! Right? - You must be Jimmy. Good to meet you, brother. Yeah, guy. Yeah. You're in the music business, right? What are you-- a performer, a rapper? I hear the ladies go crazy for the music types. Am I right? I'm in management. Oh. I'd rather not talk about my business, if you don't mind. Not at all. I hear that a lot in my line of work. Let's get some drinks. Sweet-- Oh! Whoo! [ Woman ] Hey. - Johnnie Walker Blue on the rocks for me and my friend. - You got it. Be right back. Wow. They don't make 'em like that in Beantown. I hear you have a pretty good real estate thing going on there. Word is you're the best in the business. Yeah. You hear right. But in my line of work, you gotta move with the economy. Now, I understand you wanna wash some bills. I might. I might not. - You're careful. I like that. - Here you go. So, look, what if I told you you could get a return on your investment in six months, comes back clean, untraceable, plus a 30% to 40% profit, minus my cut? [ Chuckles ] I'd ask about the catch. No catch. You get me, by the end of the week, two million dollars. Two million? This week? [ Scoffs ] No worries, brother. Yeah, I hear this a lot. Fella's got a couple hundred G's to move. Thinks he's a player, and he comes to Jimmy. Well, Jimmy's a seven-figures, deep-end-of-the-pool kind of guy. When you take off your floaties and wanna do some real business, you come to me. I'm gonna get the check. Hey, hey. All right, all right. It's not about the money. All right? Sit. Come on. Sit. It's just the time frame is all. What can I say? My investment group, we move fast. This is big-time, Eddie. Well, I'd need to see where this real estate is. I'm not investing in something if I can't see it. I wouldn't want you to. [ Chuckles ] [ Michael Narrating ] There's nothing in the world easier to get into... than an empty condo that's been on the market for six months. [ Chattering ] Never mind picking the lock. You can just call and ask for the keys. The way the Florida market is right now, it's a gold mine. I'm negotiating right now for this piece. I can pick this place up for 10, 15 cents on the dollar. Yeah, but it's empty. Yeah, that's the point. Eddie, listen. I take your cash under the table. I buy granite countertops, new appliances, new carpetin'. We flip the property. 'Cause there's no receipts. There's no records. All that money comes back to you squeaky clean. All right. I'll think about it. Don't think too long. I got a couple of guys lookin' to move on this in 48 hours. [ Cell Phone Beeps ] Are you in? Are you gonna be in? [ Beeps ] Look at me. You in? I gotta go. I gotta run. I'll be in touch. Eddie. It's not gonna last. [ Cell Phone Ringing ] Yeah, Rick. Valentine is calling everyone into the conference room... for an emergency meeting in 10 minutes, and he is pissed. That must be where Eddie's heading. What's going on? I don't know, but it is not good. What do I do, man? It's a risk, but if you run, you'll be running for the rest of your life. - It's your call. - All right. I'll go. Leave the phone on. I'm gonna go get Fi. We're gonna be listening in. You got my back on this? We're gonna do the best we can. But if it looks like something's going bad down there, get out. [ Sighs ] We should go in there. One or two bullets in the right place-- I think storming the building is probably not good for Ricky long term, Fi. The meeting's starting. [ Man On Cell Phone ] Loyalty. Respect. Standin' tall. These are the bricks I used to build this label from the street up. Without 'em, these platinum records got no place on my wall. [ Group Murmurs ] Y'all a jumpy bunch today. Anybody in here got a reason to be jumpy? Last chance to come clean, people. No? I'm disappointed. Though I can't say I'm surprised. - Marcus. - Hmm? - You recognize this. - [ Chuckles ] Aftershock's debut album-- double platinum. - Whose logo is that on this record? - Yours. Mines. And whose signature is on your paychecks? Yours, Valentine. That's right. So explain to me why you told Static Records... you could deliver Aftershock if they brought you into the fold. Static Records? Man, I don't even-- [ Stammers ] - Oh. - What-- Eddie saw you kickin' it at they offices. You take my artists-- you take the cash out my pocket. Eddie, what do I do to thieves? What you have to, Valentine. What I have to. Rick. What you think? I think you're in a conference room full of witnesses, V. [ Laughs ] My man, always appealing to my better half. You know what, Marcus? Get your ass outta here. You forgettin' something, homey? You wanted my record, right? - Take it! - [ All Exclaim ] [ Michael ] Hold on. [ Man ] Damn, Valentine. - Somebody come clean this up. Everybody out. - [ All Exclaiming, Murmuring ] Now! Let's go! Fi. Except you, Rick. [ Shotgun Cocks ] Wait. Damn it. Fi. You figure out what happened to that "guac," Ricky? Yeah. Looks like it was a bank error. I-I'm taking care of it, V. Wait. Two days. I need to see that cash. Stand down. - Tell me you heard that. - Yeah, we heard that. Sounded like Eddie was letting Valentine know who he can trust. So when Valentine finds that money gone, there's no question it's me that gets capped. I'm not gonna let that happen. I'm meeting Eddie tonight. - ** [ Dance ] - [ People Chattering ] These are just Boston numbers. Miami numbers are gonna be even better. Bigger slide in the market. I know this is a big move for you, Eddie, but I need a decision now. [ Exhales ] I need to approve spending. I want to know where my money is at any given point. You got it, brother. [ Sighs ] For me? But I didn't-- Uh-huh. Would you, uh, hold this for a second? Victor, you should have called. I can't figure out how you misunderstood. This stays with you at all times. You ever pull another stunt like that, Michael, and, uh-- [ Chuckles ] Well, don't pull another stunt like that. A Chevy Impala's parked outside. We're going for a little ride tomorrow. Doesn't that sound like fun? I'm busy tomorrow. Yeah. You have been spreading yourself kind of thin lately. I was just talking to your waitress, Michelle. Great gal. She tells me you're getting into real estate now too. You're a wicked skinner. You know that, Jimmy? I talk to you, now I got the F.B.I. crawlin' all over the place. Oh, who's this-- another investor? Tell him if he don't want the feds camped out in his backyard, he should stay the hell away from Jimmy Glynn. So did that, uh, help clear up your schedule? See you tomorrow, pal. Whoa, hold on. Hold on. So he's not gonna move the money now? He thinks I'm under F.B.I. investigation. F.B.I. I'm running out of time here, man. Valentine said, what, 48 hours? The most important thing is for you to stay calm. Fi, can you-- Yeah, I'll take care of him. Ricky, we need to talk. Do you get much of a discount on Valentine's clothing line? [ Michael Narrating ] When your cover's compromised, [ Tires Squealing ] often the best defense is a good offense. Admit nothing, deny everything. Make counteraccusations. You friggin' dubber. I oughta wring your neck. What the hell did you do to me? What are you talkin' about? I talk to you, and suddenly-- feds on my ass. What are you saying? What do you have to say about that? They came to my office. They came to my place of business. What? The F.B.I.? Are you serious? Do I look like I'm joking? Now I gotta kill my deals. All my investors are lost. I gotta move my money offshore. Do you know how much of a bath I'm gonna take... for puttin' my money away where the feds can't find it? Plus my sterling reputation. Now I'm gonna ask you this just once. [ Gasping ] Did you say anything to them? [ Whimpering ] No. No, I didn't. They didn't talk to me. I swear. I swear. All right. Let's keep it that way. [ Exhales ] Luckily, movin' money offshore is a Jimmy Glynn speciality. I'm sorry about the suit. We gotta stick together on this, pal. Okay? But if you hear anything, you see anything, you talk to me. You call me. Understood? Yeah, I understand. Okay. [ Gasps ] [ Beeps ] Sam, I need a favor. I need you to take my mom on a field trip. I gotta go see what this Victor project's about. [ Chattering ] That's what it's all about. All right, man. See you around Bye. Yeah, bye. ** [ Salsa: Man Singing In Spanish ] [ Michael Narrating ] Once somebody's watching for cops, they see them everywhere. Anyone in dark sunglasses is F.B.I. Any car with tinted windows is a tail. Their paranoia does most of the work for you. [ Shutter Clicking ] I still don't see the point of driving around, taking pictures of hotels and condos. I mean, you really want to find a new place, you know, you're gonna have to eventually go inside one, Sam. I know. I know. It's just that, if I do-- [ Shutter Clicking ] then it means it's really over with Veronica. It's just one of those psychological things, you know? I know. I know. I went through the same stuff when Frank died. And it's hard, but you gotta move on. I'm just not ready. [ Victor ] Our shipment's coming in tomorrow afternoon. It'll be held in one of those loading bays there awaiting transfer. I'll go in and cut the bolts on the door... and remove the object while you babysit the car and play lookout. We've got an hour window, maybe less. You sure you don't want me to grab it? Give you a chance to peek? Nice try though. We'll drive to the drop, go our separate ways. You ditch the car. Questions? - Just one. What are we taking? - It's bigger than a bread box, but it'll fit in the trunk. That's all you need to know, sport. That is not all I need to know, Victor. How heavy is the cargo? Are we talking about a big metal container or something fragile? If it's explosives, it will affect how I drive. Wooden crate. No explosives. Don't worry your pretty little head. - What about the guards? - If they come by, you give me the heads-up. - And then? - [ Cocks Gun ] I take care of them. [ Michael Narrating ] Knowing what someone wants... can tell you a lot about who they are. So if what they want comes in a wooden crate you're not going to be allowed to open, you might have to turn your trunk into a makeshift X-ray machine. The tube from an old TV set is a good place to start. As part of the projection process, they emit X-rays. They're meant to handle around 30,000 volts. Any more than that, and they'll cook your eyes with radiation. So pump a hundred thousand volts into one from a Taser, and you won't be able to diagnose a hairline fracture, but you'll get the basic idea. [ Cell Phone Ringing ] [ Clears Throat ] Yeah. Jimmy here. It's Eddie. We need to meet. Now. It's just like you said, Jimmy. The F.B.I.'s tailing me. They're taking pictures. Before, you said that you could move cash offshore? Well, with the feds circling, I got enough heat movin' my own money. Uh, oh-- Please, man. You gotta help me. [ Michael Narrating ] Criminals are, as a rule, paranoid and self-serving. So if you're using a criminal cover I.D., you can't be too helpful. Sorry. I wish I could help you, guy. I really do. But it's risky, too risky. [ Michael Narrating ] Luckily, you can usually count on the other guy... not to let you off easy. All right. Well-- You know, if the feds take my money, then, uh, I guess I'll have to talk to them. And they seem pretty interested in you, so it might be too risky to keep my mouth shut. Hey, hey, hey. No need for that. How do the Seychelles sound to you? I got a bank out there works with me. Fine. That sounds fine. I just have one more loose end to tie up before I move the money. Whoa. Loose end? You said nobody else knew. They won't, not for long. I got guys taking care of it right now. Good for you. Look at you. Look at you movin' up. Right? Hey, we should have a party now. I should call some ladies, have 'em come over. Let's toast. Get me a bottle. Get a new bottle out here. All right. Sound good? Sounds great. [ Beeping, Line Ringing ] Fi, get over to Ricky's. Eddie's sending a hit squad. Yeah. You call Ricky. You tell him to stay low, find a good hiding place. If he shows up, they're gonna kill him. I'll bring some firepower then. No, no, no. It can't look like you're helping him. Do something else-- anything else. Just do it now. Watch yourself. See anything? - [ Michael Narrating ] In any kind of covert operation, - [ Horn Honking ] one of the toughest challenges is using information that you're not supposed to have. If going in guns blazing will blow your cover, sometimes you've gotta get creative. I know you're in there, Ricky! You come on out and face me like a man! - Under the right circumstances, a well-placed rock... - [ Alarm Blaring ] is as good as a bullet. Come on! [ Alarm Continues ] [ No Audible Dialogue ] The good news is Eddie believes he's being investigated by the F.B.I.... and wants to move the money. The bad news is he's not gonna do it with you still alive, Ricky. So the only way to clear my name is to die a violent death? Great. Eddie has a Ricky problem. We'll help him solve it. Can you find out when Valentine's leaving the office today? - Yeah. - [ Beeps ] Sam, I need a favor. Can you stash my mom someplace safe for a couple of hours? [ Car Alarm Chirps ] Hey. I reached out to some of my people. I found the source of your F.B.I. problem. It's an accountant named Ricky Watkins. Yes! Damn it! Damn it! If you're gonna move the money, you're gonna have to take him out. I know. That's the loose end I was talking about. Okay? I sent guys, but his girlfriend showed up or something. The whole street saw 'em. Looks like somebody's gonna have to get his hands dirty. What, you mean me? - Do it myself? - I got a gun. I stole it from a coke dealer in Boca. Anybody traces it, it looks like Ricky was stealin' to buy into the drug business. You'll get away clean, but you gotta do it right now. Oh, yeah, all right. I get it. Can't do anything for yourself. Been living off of Valentine's table scraps for too long. Hey. You call this table scraps? This? It's limited edition. Ten people in the world have this watch. - [ Laughs ] - What's so funny? Yeah, you got the car. You got the watch. But you're still livin' like a rat in the shadows, not mannin' up to your business. - You shut your mouth! - What are you gonna do? You gonna wait for your guys to come back into town... and hide behind them like a rat while they shoot-- [ Groans ] [ Michael Narrating ] One of the most difficult skills to master in combat... is taking a dive. Sometimes an operation demands that you lose a fight. But it's the hardest thing in the world... to see the opening and let it go. [ Grunts ] All right, all right! Okay, okay, okay! I can take care of my business just fine! Let's do this. All right? Where's the gun? Merci beaucoup. Sugar blooms. [ Sam ] Hey. I think I know you. Huh? Aren't you the singer-rapper? Valentino? Valentine? - Yeah. - I just got one thing to say to you. You're what's wrong with our country, pal. You call that music? [ Grunting ] - What's going on there? - First of all, what do you listen to, old-timer? Barbara Mandrell. Nothing wrong with that. Kenny G., Captain & Tennille. That's, like, too gangster for me right there, man. I got something for you right here-- a melody. - Get this fool out my face. - Oh. Oh. Oh, are these your gangstas? This is cool. Am I gonna get whacked? I'm hip-hoppin' now, man. Look at me. [ Gun Cocks ] Bonjour. [ Grunting ] Uh-uh. Wanna take a ride, sugar bloomers? What the hell are you doing here? Aw, come on, man. Go. Get in. Move. What's up, man? Get down! Get down! Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. Listen to me. All right? You don't have to do this. There's still time. We can make this right. No one needs to know. [ Laughs ] Yeah, I almost wish they did know. You couldn't have pulled off that scam, not in a million years. That was beautiful. That was mine. I never did anything to you. Why are you doing this to me? Oh, man. This is your fault, Ricky. Why'd you have to push it? Why'd you have to go to the feds? - Because it's not your money. - The hell it isn't! I built that company. Me! Valentine was rappin' for pocket change when I met him. - I sold his CDs out of a van. - He trusted you. He loved you. Loved me? He made a half a billion dollars. Me? I'm a financial adviser with a weekly paycheck. Yeah. "Oh, here, Eddie, take this car." "Eddie, you know what, have a watch." Table scraps. You know, between me and you, Ricky-- I don't even like the music anymore. I can't stand it. I gotta say, it feels good to do this myself. I should've stepped up like this a long time ago. What the hell? Oh, no, no. Oh, no, no, no. - Please. - Everybody out. - Valentine. - Except you, Eddie. No. Wait, wait. [ Stammers ] Hey. Hey, man. It's me, man. It's me. Let's talk. Go ahead, talk. - It's not like it looks, man. - Yeah, I see that. So your boy, Eddie, took a ride with Valentine on his yacht. Didn't come back. And I believe I owe you guys a little more than "Thank you." Oh, no. That's not necessary. On the other hand, Fi needs new shoes. Cover our expenses, we'll call it even. That work for you? Mm-hmm. I'm not gonna forget this, Michael. You ever need anything-- I mean anything. Just say hello to your brother for me. That's a deal. The incendiary rounds you asked for. Sounds like you're planning quite a party. You sure you don't need a date? Victor's an "invite only" type. He's willing to make a few corpses just to get his hands on that box. I need to be able to take a look inside... without him turning this thing into a bloodbath. So shoot Victor and take a look. What's the problem? I take out one of their operatives, and then everyone I care about's in danger, including you. No. I want this to go off without a hitch. And that's where these come in? Just... wish me luck. Cute gun. Look at you. [ Michael Narrating ] Notorious for causing brush fires, 12-gauge incendiary rounds create a small explosion that burns at 3,000 degrees. It'll also stop a car pretty well. People don't drive when their tires are on fire. * Throw your hands up and say what * - * Are you ready for this I know you can't resist * - Hey! Hey! * But we are bringin' it so throw your hands up and say what * [ Michael Narrating ] Water sealant is a common sight around Miami... where it's used to protect buildings from hurricane flooding. It's also extremely flammable, which means it can be useful in other ways too. * Are you ready for this I know you can't resist * * But we are bringin' it so throw your hands up and say what * * Are you ready for this I know you can't resist * * But we are bringin' it so throw your hands up and say what * * Another sold-out arena Everybody see ya * * And your name is up in lights * * It's the American dream-a Everybody needs ya * * And your name is up in lights * * Right now * * When the sky get rockin' you know it ain't stoppin' * * And your name is up in lights * * Right now * * From the front to the back Can you feel it when it's time * - * Throw your hands up and say what ** - There he goes! Get him! Stop! - [ Gunshots ] - [ Shouting ] [ Victor ] I don't like your field tactics. I don't like your whining. Are you gonna pout all night? A little harmless gunfire attracts less attention than a double homicide. I warned you what would happen if you pulled another stunt, Michael. But that one-- [ Laughing ] had some style. [ Grunts ] [ Laughing ] [ Exclaiming ] [ Sighs ] Bet you're dying for a peek inside, aren't you? No. You know what you're meant to know. That's how it works. Right, Victor? You're learning, Michael. I'll see you around. [ Engine Starts ] Osso buco-- newest weapon in my arsenal. [ Chuckles ] Not bad, Sam. Bon appétit. Ooh, I gotta get going. I got an appointment to check out a townhouse. Looks right into a yoga studio. I'm proud of you, Sam. That's a big step. Thanks, Maddy. See you guys around. Uh, Sam? Didn't you forget something? Ooh. Looks like bullets. [ Chuckles ] I found them in your pants. I heard them rattling around in the washing machine when I was doing your laundry. Yeah-- nine-millimeter. Uh, hey, I-- I don't know what to say. I'd say nothing. Nothing's good. Go with nothing. I hope Sam wasn't too much trouble, Mom. [ Door Opens, Closes ] We had a lovely time. But the next time, Michael, that you want someone to babysit me, just tell me. Mom, I-- What, you didn't think I was gonna figure it out? He insisted on coming to aqua aerobics with me. I'm sorry he had to see that. Hmm. Thank you, Michael-- trying to protect me from... whatever it was. Did you bring the thing? My friend from the veterinary clinic... said she'd never seen a species quite like this one. [ Exhales ] Sniper rifle. It's an awful lot of trouble to go through for a gun. Must be for quite the occasion. And they sure don't want me to know what it is.
