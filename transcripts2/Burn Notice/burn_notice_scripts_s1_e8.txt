It is a branch of the NSA, Performing covert intelligence Support for the military. All right, that's enough. You think so? I was gonna go into The history of the service, Give people Some background. Not a bad picture. I take terrible photo I.D.'s. One of the reasons why I never worked for any Service branch directly. I suppose you think That you're gonna be able To leverage Stealing my agency I.D. card Into a ticket off the blacklist? No, I just wanted To get to know you better. Well, i've been getting to know You and your friends... Sam axe, Fiona Glenanne, Your mother. Oh, Bly, I thought I told you.6 This is just between you and me. See, I don't think so. Adjusting to your circumstances Is a process. It's natural for there to be Some grieving, some anger... Some denial. Involving your friends and family's An important part of adjusting. For example, your girlfriend, Fiona. She's not my girlfriend. Yeah. Yeah, I know. On again, off again. That is a complicated Relationship. I've been listening To the surveillance tapes... You know, I think... Well, I think both of you Have issues. One man's opinion. That's true. She is coming here to meet you, Isn't she? If my information's correct, She should be here shortly. Oh, hey. There she is. Mike, she is a really Fine-looking girl. She does take risks, though, Doesn't she? That car was stolen Three weeks ago. Have you looked inside the trunk? Seems that she's been doing Some gun dealing. Yeah. She can take care of herself. No. You should talk to her. You should talk to her, Because if she gets caught, You may never be able to resolve Those thorny relationship issues. Oh. You should get going. Hey, i'll get the check. Go. Go! Michael, what? Bly set you up. Do you have guns In the trunk? Fi? A few semiautomatics, yeah. I got a deal, Michael. This guy was selling Browning .9 millimeters For 200 bucks apiece. You have unregistered weapons In a stolen car, Fi! You know, You have always had a problem With my work. I have always supported you. I'm helping people, You're running guns! Big difference. Is the car at least clean? Good. the longer you run From the police, the more certain you are To get caught. there's a small window of time After a chase begins before backup arrives, before helicopters Are deployed. if you want any chance Of getting away, you'd best use this time To find someplace secluded... Here, here. ... And bail out. See you back at the loft? Oh, here he is now. I'll talk to you later. Your mom says, "hi." How did you get here so fast? Oh, I got a ride From a pleasant retired Gentleman named Hubert. He was concerned for my safety. Let me get this straight. I was set up by Bly? Revenge for stealing his wallet? He wasn't gonna send you to jail. Too much paperwork. He knew I'd save you. Save me? I don't need saving. The point is, It was a message for me To shut up and accept That i've been burned for good Or my friends and family Are fair game. I see. Just curious... Which am I? Can we discuss this later? So once Bly gets taken care of, We can discuss our relationship? Sure. I don't suppose killing him Would expedite that? No, Fi, no. He's the best connection I have. He can tell me why I was burned, Who did this to me. I need to get some leverage. If I got to go to war with Bly, I got to put some cash together. These guys come down And make me give them money... ... Every couple of days. At first, they said It was for protection. Now they don't even bother to lie. they work for this bruja, Concha ramirez. She's got guys all around here. A woman boss. How progressive. Listen, pretty soon, I can't be in business no more. I talked to my friend Javier. you helped him with that cabr?n... That came after his kid. And asked him not To talk about it, yeah. What exactly are you looking for? I got 20 grand. I want them out of the neighborhood. No, I want them gone. These guys work for this woman, Concha. It sounds like an organization. Javier said you could handle it. Aw, I'm flattered, but... They're ruining The neighborhood, okay? People who lived on this block Their whole lives Are losing everything. My pops built this place. I ain't giving up without a fight. Have you tried Talking to the police? They come, give me paperwork, And go back to coral gables. I try to get the neighborhood to Fight, but they're scared. We got families. I need your help. 10 grand now, The rest after. I'll see what I can do. Don't "i'll see what I can do." Do it. You're the last chance we got. Okay. Yeah, Sam? Hey, Mike. We got a situation here. Your buddy Bly talked to my Girlfriend, and she's pissed. Hi, honey. She hit me with one of those Meat tenderizers. Sam, get in here! Okay, honey. Just a minute. Do you want an extraction team? I'll let you know. What about Bly? The son of a bitch is doing Scorched-earth number here. I'm taking care of it. See if you can get out in one piece. Yeah. Sweetie, hey. Easy now. Come on. A CIA agent came into my home. Look, it wasn't CIA, it was CSS. It's a branch of The national security agency. He told me you were seeing That whore in bal harbour. I was just going To get my clothes. It's over, pumpkin. Oh! Mike, this is some serious Collateral damage. I mean, I like this girl. We got to do something. I know. I know. I think this will be enough cash To take care of Bly, Maybe even find out Why I was burned. What, are you gonna Throw money at him? Something like that. I'll work out the details. You know anything About this gang? They work for a cuban ?migr? Named Concha Ramirez. She works out of a restaurant On Miami beach. I don't know. Organized crime Is a pain in the ass. There's a reason I didn't become a FED. We just need them to decide The neighborhood's not worth The trouble and move on. Scare the hell out of them. Sounds like fun. Let's do the recon, Check out her soldiers, Take a look at Concha, And see what we're dealing with. Here you go, Sam. Buy your girlfriend Some flowers. Oh, Mike, it's gonna take More than flowers. I mean, she's pretty pissed. This Bly was rude... I mean, really rude. She's feeling a little better now. Okay, perfect. Thanks. I'll get the check. When you gonna get a real car? This thing's like a toy. Veronica was gonna get me a cadillac Until Mike's surveillance guy Screwed everything up. A cadillac? What could you possibly be doing To these women? Wouldn't you like to know? There she is. Wow. Not bad for a crime boss. dice que no puede pagar. Que tiene un chiquito enfermo. ?com\an no puede pagar? ?porqu\ t? Me traes esto? mira, si ?l no puede pagar D?le, preg?ntale a la esposa, "?si tienes el seguro De la vida?" porqu\ t... Mira, yo te di ?sto... Usalo. ?porqu\ t me traes \sto?i> vaya. Get in there. in intelligence work, surveillance Is called "coverage." it's like basketball... you can run zone defense Or man-to-man. man-to-man's risky. follow someone too long, they're going to get Suspicious. zone is usually the way to go. stay put and let targets Come to you. less obvious, Easier on the feet... ... And you can catch up On your celebrity gossip. Charo. Mira que yo tengo para t^. No saque es aqu^. no habla. Entrale, entra. They're leaning hard On the neighborhood. Bad business... Driving away People who are paying you off. So they're amateurs. That'll make it easier To get rid of them. I'm not sure it was a good idea To give Sam the caf? Three cuban coffees in, His camerawork Gets kind of jittery. It's not the coffee. He has lady-friend problems. You know, I have to say, Sam's romantic side is surprising. Not now, Fi. I'm talking about sam. And you're going to use Sam As a way to talk about us. After. All right? All right. But I promise you, If I'm not satisfied, Then I am gonna kick your ass. explaining the rules Of covert ops is always a challenge. it's a world where good guys Look like bad guys and two wrongs do, in fact, Make a right. I got to bust up your counter. You want to smash up my counter? And a few other things. It's part of the plan, Ernie. No, I already got enough people Who want to smash up my place. I don't need anymore. The only way this ends Is if these guys think They're up against somebody Worse than they are. I thought you were supposed To protect the neighborhood. If I act like a security guard, They're just gonna send more guys. My friend said you could fight. He said you were, you know, Special forces. Bullets don't bounce off My skin, Ernie. I'm gonna solve this, But I got to do it my way. And, Ernie, Ernie, look. I need your help. What do you want me to do? I need you to spread the word That some serious psycho Robbed your place. And please, please, Keep your mouth shut About hiring me, Or you'll get us both killed, You understand? There's no turning back, Ernie, After I do this. If you want to walk away, Now's the time. I don't walk away. Do it. All right, call the cops In five minutes. So, my job is to say That a psycho robbed my store. What's your job? I get to be the psycho. Trust me, that's The hard part. Aah! as cover I.D.'s go, I prefer rich businessman Or international playboy to crazy thief, but if the situation Calls for it, you do what you have to do. What's this dude doing on my car? Oh, boys, boys, boys. You need to do me a favor. Nothing personal, but you need To leave the neighborhood. Yeah, well, why's that? Because it's mine. And they're out of here! ?qu?Diablos pas? Eh? no s? Mano. Un hombre... Estaba loco. pues, entra. Entra. Concha quiere hablar Contigo. They made it back... Barely. Nice work. I'd say 8.5 for style. Maybe 9 for execution. Quite a compliment. Keep an eye out. See what moves they make. They'll be back soon enough. We get to babysit the bad guys For a while. You've been checking that thing All day. Expecting a call? No. Well, the... The lady friend. Send her flowers? Yes, I sent her flowers. Why do you think I'm checking my phone? What did the card say? It said, "I'm sorry. Call me." She doesn't need, "I'm sorry." She needs to know who you are, Where she stands. I would imagine. All right, well, let's say I sent her a second card. What would it say? Jason Bly. Always a pleasure. Nice job ditching the police The other day. You always manage those things With such style. Maybe it's the sunglasses. Where did you get them? Oh, an algerian special-OPS guy I tangled with a while back. He didn't need them anymore. I'd part with them if you'd Tell me why I got burned. Tempting, but that's classified. No, I just came by to see If you'd reconsidered Your position at all. I've been reading up On your exploits. You are a man of many talents. Nice to be appreciated. My hope... My commitment, really, Is that you'll find a new outlet For your skills here in Miami, A new outlet that involves You settling down And no longer making problems For the intelligence community. I see. You got any ideas? Well, I realize that You probably don't have much In the way of job references From your times in afghanistan Or the former Soviet Republics, So I am prepared to offer you Full-time employment... Papers and references. You'll start as a security guard At a bank. And who knows where things Might go from there? Really? A security guard? A new life as a private citizen. A spook no more.
