No scary czechs buying sci-fi Paperbacks on a regular basis. We won't be Ambushing him there. He's been ordering food At the hotel. Not room service. He stops by the kitchen To place his order, Oversees the cooking Himself. Religious reasons. He wants to make sure The food is halal. Halal? Nice cover story. Jan isn't muslim. There's got to be Another reason Why he's spending time In the kitchen. Here's some cash. Spread it Around the kitchen staff. See what you can find out. Yeah, mom? Michael, Can you come over? It's an emergency. It's your brother. What happened? I told him That nate wasn't here, But t-they said They'd stay anyway. I tried to call you, And they wouldn't let me. T-then nate came in, And they started hitting him. They said He owed them money. They broke the dishes? No, I did. Mrs. Hale's always coming over When I have the tv on too loud, So I figured She'd hear the crash. Anyway, they left When they saw her coming. Why didn't you call The police? Because nate said it would Cause him even more trouble. I got warrants. Mom, I need to talk to Nate. Don't you get angry At him, all right? It's a sickness, Michael, Just like your father. Look, I just need My half of the money So I can pay these guys, All right? If I give you money, You'll go to the track, And you'll try to double it. You'll try to make a little Extra until it's gone. I can help you, Nate. I can get these guys Off your back. You could hide out In my place. I don't need A goddamn place to hide. I can protect myself. Yeah, blocking punches with Your face... real effective. I got a guy Bringing me a gun. A gun? I'm not gonna need To use it, mom, If he'll just give me The money. Michael, please. I'll give him the money After the job. I'll make sure the money goes To the right place. Go to hell. a rescue attempt is hard enough when it's someone who actually Wants to be rescued. doesn't matter whether It's a brother with a compulsive-gambling Problem or a girl who thinks she's about to launch Her modeling career. so, you eliminate Escape options... ... keep a low profile... ... but no matter what you do, you'll still have someone Screaming bloody murder in the back of your car. Bill, don't worry. We've got a plan. I'll go with you. I should be there. No, listen to me. The best thing for you to d Is stay at home. You'll be the first one We call. Talk to you soon. Michael? Is Nate with you? No. I'm just fixing his truck. What's wrong, mom? He said he was going over To your apartment To get his share Of the money. What? He's going over to my place? What's his cell number? Nate doesn't have a cell. They cut him off months ago. Michael! Nate! some situations just come down To probability... the chance that an assassin With a handgun can hit you at 50 yards, the number of shots He can get off. might have a 1-in-5 chance Of taking a bullet, maybe a 1-in-10 chance Of dying... Nate! ... or a 100% chance Of getting blown away by a shotgun wired to a door. A ricochet Is usually not deadly, But it sure feels that way. Michael! Aah! Where the hell is Michael...

Okay, so who takes the guy In the front? Nobody. What happens then? People start shooting. We lose, we're dead. We win, we got three bodies, A traumatized girl, And spots on the FBI's Most wanted list. I've been on plenty Of those lists. It's not so bad. Here they are. Let's do this.

It was an accident. I'm sure the cops Will sort it all out. Jenna: we're not going t Make the flight. any decent criminal Will change his plans at the mention Of the word "cops." Don't worry, Jenna. We'll catch a plane tomorrow. Best we sort this out. Hey, you guys got a pen? We could start exchanging Information. I assume you guys have Insurance, right? I don't think It's necessary For us to get the insurance Companies involved. Well, I don't know, Pal. I got hit pretty good. Don't come looking For more. Let's go back to the house. Oh! Hey! It's illegal To drive away from an accident. Mike better have one hell Of an excuse for not being here. Aah. Easy. spend a lot of time In countries without hospitals, you pick up a few things. Take it easy. Now, make a small incision Just above the wound. You want me to just dig in Here or what? You're enjoying this Way too much. Disinfect the blade In the alcohol. And then run the lighter Over the edge of the blade. God damn. This is kind of fun. Small incision. Small incision! Aah! Come on, you'd think I was Pulling a goddamn cannonball Out of your shoulder. Just a little more. God! Okay. Okay. All right. There you go, You big baby. Jesus. What happened? Mike, you get shot? There's cops all over Out there. No, it was just this gang-bang Drive-by thing.

How's your shoulder? Patched up. It hurts, but it wasn't deep. Glad to hear it. Listen, Mike... I understand you got A situation, but so do I. I mean, I'm covering for you, But if I lose my pension, You're gonna be changing My diapers When I'm 95 and drooling. Sam, I would never let That happen. I'd smother you With a pillow first. Promise me you're not gonna pick Any fights in this place. It's the only bar in Miami That will let me run a tab. Hi, mom. It's Nate. Bill's been hurt. You said you were going To get her. I didn't hear from you. So I went to the house. Barely made it Through the front gate. I thought You were my friend. I'm sorry. Something came up. I need to call the police! This was a bad idea. She'll be on a plane Within the hour. Don't call. We don't have time. I said I'll take care of it, And I'll take care of it. What are you gonna do? Same plan as before, Just a different target. running an operation, you can't let personal feelings Get in the way. it's about planning And execution... You have to get out. Now! Now! ... not about being angry. Come on! Let's go! Move it! Wow, this is Really well-made. Open the door. Out! Piss me off. Move. Whoa, whoa! Do you know Who my brother is? I know who he is, And I know what he does. Get off me, man! You're making... although, occasionally, You may get a little angry. Helping people's Not a bad gig, bro, But if you want to make Some real money, I could hook you up. Did you pay them back, These guys you owe? Yeah. Most of it. Look, they're not gonna be Visiting mom for a while, All right? Think he suffocated? You ready to call Your brother, Let him know You want to go home? I think that's a "yeah." I want my brother back. How much? We don't want your money, Which is not to say That we want you to have it. We want all your records And all the money you made From all the girls you pimped. Pimped? I'm not a pimp. You say tomato. I say pimp. You can keep Whatever you made legally From, you know, The photo studio, But the girls Get the rest of it. What are you, Some kind of crusading cop? No, Unfortunately for you, I'm just some guy You managed to piss off. Your brother's In a trunk of a car, carl. He's eating On 10 bucks a day. That's a bag of chips, A sandwich, and a coke. Tomorrow he eats on 5, And we'll be down To sugar packets by friday. And just so there's No misunderstanding, You're going to explain To Jenna Exactly What was waiting for her At the other end Of that flight. I think that covers it. We'll wait for your call. You know... I think we could probably Keep some of that money For ourselves. It's not like the girls Are gonna miss it. What? They don't know How much there is. I met some of those girls At the party. Some of them Probably couldn't even count. There is a reason family is always a good source Of leverage, whether it's a brother That always owes people money or a brother Stuck in the trunk of a car. you can't really turn Your back on them. Out. Come on. Walk. Walk. Who are you? I'm a friend Of your father's. the drive home Is often a grueling experience for someone You've just rescued, especially if they were unaware Of their situation. they ask a lot of questions. you fill them In on the answers, and then it dawns on them... ... the truth. it can be A little overwhelming. Neat. What's this? What's this, huh? Oh, neat. What does this say here? Anall-phyl... How do you say That word, Jan? Anaphylactic. What does that word mean? Can't... breathe. Oh, you can't breathe? Is this for when your throat Closes up from allergies, Like from pollen? 'Cause that's what I get. Or maybe It's the crushed peanuts I sprinkled On your hot dog. Yeah, I talked To the chef at the hotel. Seems like you're allergic To peanuts. Well, Now that you've shot me, And I hold your life In my hands, I think It's time we talked. No, no, no, no.

Yeah, I don't think These guys get a lot of action. They were very excited To finally get their hands On a former soviet bloc Wet work guy. They were like kids On christmas. What did they get out of him? I mean, he tried to kill me. I assume he's gonna try And finish the job. Yeah, about that... I guess they never got a chance To talk to him. Why is that? Some guys came by In the middle of the night And took him away. What guys? Nobody knows. They walked in With some heavy-duty clearances, Took Jan off the FBI's hands, And poof, they were gone. Word is they found Jan Hanging from his shoelaces. I mean, who leaves a guy In a holding cell With shoelaces, right? Anyway, they're calling it A suicide. Michael. Yeah? Do you know What's going on? Looks like whoever burned me Has something planned. They don't want me Leaving Miami, But they don't want me Dead, either. Do you know why? ==http://www.ragbear.com== www.tvsubtitles.net
