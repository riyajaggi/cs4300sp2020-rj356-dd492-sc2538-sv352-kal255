 Hey! I think the White Shark Gang is here. Are they serious? How can those murderers smile like that?  Detective Ku, where's our backup? At the Sungun Bridge. They told us to wait. Is that a joke? We'll get them on our own. -Excuse me? -What? -They told us to standby. -If we wait, their boat will sail away. Don't miss a single one. Catch them all. We'll go out for a meal after this, okay? -Yes, sir. -Let's go. -All right. -Let's do this! MY OTHER HALF ACCEPT Hello, 112 Emergency.

 Someone is trying to kill me. Please help. Can you repeat that, please? -Someone wants to kill you? -Yes. Someone is trying to kill me. Where are you right now? I'm not sure. Stairs. I see some narrow stairs. What is it? I think she's hurt. It's hard to hear. She doesn't know where she is. Put her through. Hello. Please stay calm. We need an address to dispatch a team. Church. There is a church. Banseok... I'm beside the Banseok Church. Please help me. Please help me. -Ma'am. -Hello? Hello? -She got disconnected. Go on, call her. -Yes, sir. What are you doing? Call her. Please help me. I'm sorry, ma'am. We got disconnected. I know it's hard, -but can you repeat what you said? -I see the Banseok Church. Help me, please. Help me. Ma'am? Hello? Are you there? Please don't kill me. I have a baby at home. Please let me live. That's is why you shouldn't have run. No! Ma'am. Ma'am. Hello, ma'am? White Sharks! Come here. -Punk. -Come on. -Stop them. -Go on. Now! Come here. It's your lucky day. Don't come any closer! I have nothing to lose. When I put those handcuffs on him, the sound of metal made me so happy. Let's drink to that. -Cheers. -Cheers. Goodness! Are you guys the only ones who catch bad guys in Korea? Yes, ma'am. Our team has the best record this year. We're always the best. It's boring. Sir, answer that. You're getting a call. Who could it be? It's Dae-sik. Gosh, Dae-sik is calling me. Dae-sik from Unit Two again? Why does he always call you? Goodness, what a punk. Hey. Dae-sik! Where are you? Hurry up and join us! -We're at the old lady's place. -Jin-hyeok. -Have you spoken to your wife? -Why? Why are you asking about my wife? I think she called me earlier. Why? Well... there was a murder in Eunhyeong-dong. -I came here with Chief Jang. -Oh, so you can't join us. You'll regret it. We're going for another round! Some guy... murdered a woman after trying to rape her. In her wallet... we found your wife's ID. Oh, come on. Try calling her right now. For now, -we got her fingerprint just in case. -Hey, is today April Fools? What am I saying? Is today April Fools? -What are you talking about? -Why are you lying to me?  You'd know if you saw her face. Just take a look! You're not making any sense. The thing is... her face is severely damaged. -We can't identify the person. -Okay. If she picks up, you're dead. Hang up now. He says my wife's dead. How is that possible? It's a joke. Don't take it seriously. You scared me. Let me call her. What is she doing? Is she busy? Let's have another drink. Go on.  No, I'm good. -My glass is empty. -Pour him some more. What's wrong? Why isn't she picking up? {\an8}FORENSICS Did you call him? You punk. Jin-hyeok, are you drunk? Jin-hyeok, how did you get here? -Get out of my way. -Jin-hyeok. Listen to me. Go home. I'll take care of things here. -Go home. -Get out of my way! What is this? HOW COULD YOU LEAVE LIKE THAT? DID YOU FORGET YOUR BIRTHDAY? HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DETECTIVE I LOVE YOU -No, Jin-hyeok. -Jin-hyeok! Was she acting up because I didn't come home? Hey... no one would eat that. Why were you bringing it to me? Let's go home! -Jin-hyeok. -Hey. Move. No! No, please! No. What's this? Oh, gosh! It's cold. Let's go. Last night at 10 p.m., in a residential area of Eunhyung-dong, a woman was brutally murdered. The victim was Ms. Heo, the wife of Sergeant Mu Jin-hyeok from Sungun Police's Violent Crimes Unit One. Sergeant Mu Jin-hyeok has been  awarded many national merit badges. Since he was busy on another case and couldn't come home, Ms. Heo was taking him some food when she was attacked. This is nothing but a tragedy. The victim did call 112 Emergency, but the agent's incompetency led her to be murdered. Harsh criticisms are being made against the police. The Sungun Metropolitan Police said they will punish the person responsible for the attack and fire the director of the 112 Emergency Call Center. -I have decided to resign. -Do you admit to your mistake? Did you fail to do your job? Thank you. Take care. Take care of him. Jin-hyeok. Jin-hyeok. They captured the guy this morning. His name is Ko Dong-cheol. He was a bouncer at the Rambada Club. He has a huge rap sheet. We found bloody clothes in his house. The blood was tested. The results proved... it's your wife's blood. The trial will start soon. It was the Call Center's mistake. The higher-ups want to end this fast. He'll definitely get a life sentence. -Get a hold of yourself. -Kyeong-hak. Kyeong-hak... I hadn't been home for so long. That fool was trying to make me eat and this is what happened. I became a detective so we could have plenty to eat. This is ridiculous. Let me say one thing. Ko Dong-cheol... put him behind bars for me. Make sure he never gets out. Let's just say... If he ever does get out... I will kill him. Got that? {\an8}COURTHOUSE {\an8}On November 25th, {\an8}Ko Dong-cheol, the suspect, found Heo Ji-hye, who was taking food to her husband. While the suspect dragged the victim to an alley and sexually assaulted her, the victim protested vigorously. Then, the suspect hit her 30 times with his weapon, making dents in her skull and destroying her myelencephalon. Moreover, the defendant committed this heinous crime while the victim was still alive. The defendant has already said he was drunk that night and remembers nothing. The defendant is insulting the court with his statement in an attempt to reduce his sentence. The prosecution calls Ms. Kang Gwon-ju from the Emergency Call Center who answered the victim's call. Miss, step forward. Did you talk to the suspect who killed Heo Ji-hye that night? Yes, I did. So you must clearly remember the suspect's voice. Defendant, what is your name? What? It's Ko Dong-cheol. Is this the voice you heard? When you received the phone call, -the defendant was drunk and... -That's not the voice I heard. Dae-sik... what is she saying? Well... there's a rumor that she's been saying Ko Dong-cheol did not kill your wife and the actual suspect also killed her father. But it was proven that her father's death was a hit-and-run accident. I think she's scheming to cover up her mistake because she's desperate. Order! Are you saying that the suspect and the defendant have different voices? Yes. You will know I'm telling the truth if you listen to the recording. Are you saying there are more recordings besides the ones submitted to the court? Yes, from 10:18 to 10:21 p.m., of the suspect talking to my father, who was patrolling the area and had a walkie-talkie, right after the crime. He also killed my father. He's in his late 20s to mid-30s. The suspect's voice... was lower than the defendant's. I also heard tiny cracking noises from his jaw. I'd like to have a word with the witness. What are you doing? Are you crazy? I told you from the start that the voice was different. You were the one who chose to ignore it. Yeah. And you still insist on that nonsense? You're screwing with me. You can't have heard that. Your Honor, the defendant is not the attacker. Please play the recording... of the day of the murder. Silence! Let's listen to the recording. Please don't kill me. I have a baby at home. Please let me live. There should be... more of me talking to my father through the walkie-talkie. This is all the police sent us. It can't be. Something must've gone wrong. I talked to the attacker. -I heard his voice! -Miss, if you keep doing this, you'll be charged with perjury. Do something. She's saying I'm innocent. Silence! Say something to reduce my sentence. -Jin-hyeok. -Hey. Tell the truth. Hey. Let go of me. They found evidence in his house. Did he bribe you? Will you tell the truth if I pay you? Here you go. Take this and tell the truth. -Stop it. -Hey. -Back off! -Silence! I'll hold you in contempt! Your Honor, she shouldn't give false testimony in court! This is a warning. One more outburst and you'll be asked to leave. They found evidence in his... He just smiled. Hey. What's so funny? Tell me, huh? -Jin-hyeok! -Let go. -What's so funny? -Calm down. Is this funny? Sergeant, settle down! -Get him out of here! -What's so funny? -Calm down! -Jin-hyeok, please. -Come here. -Court is adjourned. Hey, you! The witness from the Call Center testified the defendant's voice doesn't match the attacker's voice. So the defendant, Ko Dong-cheol, changed his testimony. But the police say the recording of the voice the witness claims to have heard does not exist at all. The police expressed their confusion, and there are a lot of rumors as to whether the witness has any connection to Ko Dong-cheol. THREE YEARS AFTER THE EUNHYEONG-DONG MURDER SUNGUN METROPOLITAN POLICE Hello, 112 Emergency. You can be fined for making prank calls. {\an8}You found clothes covered with blood? {\an8}Yes. What does the man look like? Okay, short hair. {\an8}-I'll send them right away. -Sam-dong Patrol Division. {\an8}The assailant is chasing the victim. {\an8}He is on the Sam-dong overpass, 500 feet from the Green Library. {\an8}THE ANALYSIS TEAM MANAGES RESULTS AND STATISTICS OF CRIME SCENES My grandfather received a phishing call while I was at work. They called and said his grandson had been kidnapped! We'll play the recording of the heinous voice phishing suspect. You don't care if your grandson dies? If you don't send the money, he will die. Yes, 112 Emergency. I have information about a case. Please turn on the CTC news. Pardon? What do you mean? I can help. Just turn on the news. What is it? She says I should turn on the news. Really? Turn on the TV. How can someone do this? It's driving me crazy. Oh, gosh! The suspect will pay for this! My grandfather worked really hard to look after me after my parents died. The suspect of the phishing call on the news -is the grandson who's being interviewed. -Pardon? How can you be sure? He tried to change his voice with a modulator. But the recorded voice matches the grandson's breathing, speech pattern, and accent. A person's voice is like a fingerprint. There's a 99% chance that the grandson did this. -Check him out. -What? Hello? It's a sad case of a grandfather who made a living by collecting trash. Next, the case of Ms. Yu who was found dead a month ago in Gojeong-dong. Mr. Jang, her ex-boyfriend, was listed as a suspect and should've been questioned by the police. However, we found out that the police failed to locate the suspect's whereabouts. My name is Kang Gwon-ju. I have special talents that others don't know about. I see the world with my ears, not my eyes. You lent him the money? After recovering from an eye injury when I was young, I can hear and see all the noises... with my ears. Gosh! You'll pay me 100,000 won if I talk to you? I'll call you from Eunhyeong Station. Listen to me! Don't suspects have rights? -Be quiet! -But... The police is attacking people, not protecting them. -Punk! -Sir, please listen to me. I don't deserve to be beaten just because I'm the manager of an escort agency. -I told you to be quiet. -I swear! They beat me hard. I'd like some beef-bone soup. I'm starving. Jin-hyeok, what's wrong with you? You wanted to catch this punk, and we lost the suspect of the Gojeong-dong case. We're in trouble now. People can't believe the victim's head was cracked open. It's a total mess! -You know that, right? -You scum. That's why you should've told us where he was while I was in a good mood. My goodness! Don't you understand what I'm saying? How many times must I say I haven't seen Dong-cheol in years? -Sit down, come on. -Okay, fine. -What a jerk. -Enough. This is a Patrol Division. Act accordingly. I understand how you feel, but it's been three years. How long will you do this? It's been long enough! Damn. That punk is a loudmouth. I nearly went deaf. That little... Goodness! You're working so hard. What on earth is going on here? Hey, you look fine. You don't deserve this. Jung-gi. Can't you be a little nicer? We got him. Relax. It'd make everyone happy. Stop saying nonsense. So, is that thing in order now? It was quite a lot of work for me to take care of. So what? Fine. I don't care anymore. Just write the report for Chief Jang. How long... are you going to do things for that crazy bastard? Gosh, it tastes good! Jin-hyeok! -Let's go. -All right, then. See you later. Look at him being shy. Goodness gracious. Hang on. Are you that guy? You are. You're the husband of the lady who was killed by Dong-cheol. -Jin-hyeok, let's go. -That's why... That's why you beat me like crazy. That explains a lot. -Shut it already. -Hang on. Let's go. This guy's persistent, isn't he? It's been ages since Dong-cheol's trial went awry, you crazy jerk! Seriously. What? -Jin-hyeok. -Don't listen to him. Let's go. No wonder she got stabbed to death. Her husband's an idiot. How dare you? This is funny. You're so brave, aren't you? What did you just say? Say it again. You want me to say it again? You have cameras here, right? Are you going to hit me? -Shut up. -Punk! Look at how he's staring at me. -Come here. -You can't beat me here. Are you scared? You won't just be suspended this time! Goodness. Suspended? You're right. How scary. I should just quit. Let's go. I'm leaving. Bye. -Goodbye. -Back to work. Hey, Jin-hyeok! Stop him! Put the chair down! -What the heck? Stop him! -Cover the cameras! Stop that! Stop him! What are you doing? Cover the cameras! -Hurry! -We're screwed now. I'll get going now. Come on. Don't look at me. You guys take care of him. -Don't-- -I don't know what to do. Go on. Get rid of him. Golden Time Team? You want me to support the Golden Time Team? That's a bit... COMMISSIONER BAE BYEONG-GON All right. Let me think about it. Three, five , and ten minutes after an incident occurs is the golden time frame where you can save a victim before they die. Acting within this time frame is our team's goal. We will try to be at the scene three minutes after the call and arrest the criminal within ten minutes. The Golden Time Team will be dispatched before any other team. That's all. Basically, you're saying... the Violent Crimes Unit will work under the control of the Emergency Call Center? Is that it? Not work under. We'd be cooperating to get to the scene faster. Ms. Kang... I'm glad you've learned how things are done in America, but you know nothing about the Korean police. -Besides, this is against the hierarchy. -Then... what are you going to do about the cases  where you failed to arrest the criminals because of the after-report system? Especially the Sungun Metropolitan Police who has an very low callback rate. {\an8}-Isn't that criminal negligence? -What? You should know what I mean. The Songshin-dong case in February. The Hwami-dong case last October. The callers died because of the system and the rules. Even the phishing call case in Buwol-dong. It could've been solved in a minute if the voice was properly analyzed. Ms. Kang! You're making a big deal out of nothing. Why should we go against each other? -Rules are rules. -I'm just saying we should maximize the Emergency Call Center's function by changing the rules and creating a team that acts promptly. What? Jin-hyeok! You were demoted recently. How could you beat him like that? Jin-hyeok. You must stop this. Ko Dong-cheol is nowhere to be seen. He must be dead, okay? Come on. Get a hold of yourself so Dong-u can get better. If your wife saw this... she'd be heartbroken. Hey. Hey. Let's eat. I'm hungry. The lady who testified at your wife's trial... was sent here as the Call Center manager. She volunteered... to be sent here. What did you say? -That's the only station we see. -Thank you. Go on. The reporter doesn't speak Korean. What should I do? Kid, don't make prank calls. Unbelievable. We're busy enough catching criminals. Let's go in. We watched the presentation and visited the Call Center. I think we did the best we could. -Don't you think so? -Yes, sir. You know our Call Center has the lowest callback rate in Korea. She said she'd make it the highest within six months, and asked headquarters to let her work here. Since she solved a big case in the US, they seem to be very supportive. I can't believe she asked to come back here. She must be out of her mind. Anyway, I think the rumor that she studied abroad with the money that Ko Dong-cheol paid her... is true. We have another meeting soon. Let's go. -Chief Jang. -Yes. Catch the Gojeong-dong criminal. All those reporters are making my blood pressure pills useless. Please don't worry. Our team is staking out the area. We will arrest him today. Ms. Kang, don't waste the Commissioner Bae's time again. You won't like what you see. Understood? Let's go, sir. You should see if this is a waste of time or not. -What? -Am I wrong? You were here for ten minutes. I'm surprised you made a decision. Ms. Kang! {\an8}Kang Gwon-ju, come here. Kang Gwon-ju! -Kang Gwon-ju! -You can't do this. Please leave. Kang Gwon-ju! -Kang Gwon-ju! -Excuse me. It really is her. Hey, come here. -Come here. -You can't do this. No. Let me go. -Let me go. -It's fine. Let him go. -Nice to see you. -It's been a while, Sergeant Mu. Let's talk over there. Hey.... we're not going anywhere. You have such thick skin. How dare you come here? You took a bribe from a criminal and made a huge mess in court. How dare you come back? Do you think we're idiots? Do you think Korean police officers are pushovers? Is that it? What's going on? Isn't that Mu Jin-hyeok? Yes. Now that I think of it, Ms. Kang is the officer who took the call from the victim of the Eunhyeong-dong case. A case from three years ago where Jin-hyeok's wife was killed. Given the Call Center agent's testimony, the defendant walked away free. What? Why did she come back? I heard you were a total wreck, but you're worse than I thought. I was going to ask you to be our team leader, but maybe I shouldn't. Team leader? Wow! Thank you so much for thinking of me. I should be grateful, right? Right. You even used your father's death to keep your position. You managed to survive, of course. Do you even pay tribute to your dad on his death anniversary? Think whatever you like. You can blame and curse me. You won't believe me... whatever I say. I think you still need more time... to accept my apology. -Hey. -Jin-hyeok! I knew it. Why are you just standing there? Jin-hyeok, I understand. Please put your hand down, okay? The commissioner is looking. Just back off, Dae-sik. Back off. Tell me. Why did you do that three years ago? Why did you disappear after lying? Why did you say you heard something you never did? Why? Did you really want to use your father's death and take the bastard's money to study abroad? Is that it? Tell me. ACCEPT Hi, 112 Emergency. Okay. May I have your name? A kidnapping report from Eunhyeong-dong T-junction. -Kidnapping? -Yes. Please calm down. Can you... If I tell you the truth... will you believe me? Ms. Kang, there's a kidnapping report from Eunhyeong-dong. -Answer me. -We cannot afford to lose the victim. Let's talk more... after I take the call. Her name is Park Bok-nim. She's 17 years old. She went to Eunhyeong Station to meet a guy from a chatting app and got kidnapped five minutes ago. Hello, this is Kang Gwon-ju. Can you please tell me what happened? I told you many times. I've been kidnapped by a crazy man. Come quickly, please. The man... is completely insane. He has... a lot of knives in his bag. -Track her phone. Find out where she is. -Yes, ma'am. I met him on a chatting app. He said he'd pay me 100,000 won just for small talk. So we agreed to meet at Eunhyeong Station. Is 5885 your last four digits? Come with me. Do you have the money? -I'll give it to you later. -Show me first. Just follow me. What the heck? This way. Hey, mister. I'm going home. Look for another girl. All right. Oh, how annoying. We tracked the phone. It's within a two-mile radius of Eunhyeong-dong Station. It's a prepaid phone, so getting GPS coordinates will take a while. EUNHYEONG REDEVELOPMENT AREA What do you see around you? There's a plastic tarp on the floor, bricks, wood, and sand. It looks like a construction site. Plastic tarp on the floor may mean he didn't kidnap her just to rape her. Where is he now? I threw a brick out the window. He went out, thinking I got out. Good job, Bok-nim. Since it's an emergency, -I'll speak casually, okay? -Okay. {\an8}Code Zero. A kidnapping has occurred. {\an8}The abductor has weapons and is possibly a murder suspect. The victim is in a building within a two-mile radius of 36 Eunhyeong-dong, Youngdong-gu. Nearby patrol division should help. Sergeant Mu from the Seogu Patrol Division is dispatched from the Golden Time Team. You can't go inside. Are you insane? Who are you to order me around? Can you hear me? This is an emergency. If we don't act within ten minutes, the victim's life will be at risk. -You know that very well. -Yeah? So what? When are the police coming? I'm so scared. Please help me. Please. Someone is trying to kill me. Help me, please. I said someone is trying to kill me. All right. I'll talk to you later. Jin-hyeok... Look at him just leaving like that. What is she doing? Ms. Kang, since when is there a Golden Time Team? Don't you know just contacting the patrol division is enough? -What if it's just a pervert? -If it's just a pervert, he wouldn't have so many knives and a plastic tarp. That's what you think. Our team can't act on such a small case. I don't care. I figured things hadn't changed in the past three years. Where are you going? She's just provoking you to make herself look competent. That's where your wife died! Dae-sik... the girl asked for our help. She cried... begging for her life. You said they're on their way. Where are they? When on earth will they arrive? You don't mind people like me dying? What a lame life... I must have led. Well, even my name sucks. How about we go get a new name later? Excuse me? My name sucks too. It means "offer someone a drink." My dad was always drunk, even on the day I was born. That's how he chose my name. I got bullied a lot because of my name when I was in school. A good-for-nothing dad, huh? Your father is a jerk just like mine. Zoom in. Bok-nim, I know how you feel. But you'll get on with a better life when you get out of there. If I listen to you, I'll get out of this place, right? I promise. Okay. Thanks. For the police to get there fast, we really need your help. Think hard. Do you remember anything about the area you're in? The streets, something you heard. Anything will help. I think I saw a playground. A playground? Here. At the playground, he dragged me to the left. This is the Call Center. The abductor moved from the playground to the redevelopment area, left of the T-junction. I repeat. The abductor moved from the playground to the redevelopment area. Oh, jeez. I can't believe that you're out here for backup. I heard you've become a total wreck, but you're worse than I thought. I was going to ask you to be our team leader, -but maybe I shouldn't. -What a nut case. And I saw something with colors. Something with colors. He turned left at the T-junction. Something with colors. What could it be? {\an8}THREE MINUTES AFTER THE EUNHYEONG-DONG CASE CALL I'm from the Myunhak Patrol Division. It's just you guys? All the others were sent to a marathon for support. The Burim Patrol Division will join us shortly. -It's strange. -This is crazy. Backup from the Myunhak Patrol Division arrived at the site. Here's a list of people in the area with criminal records. Bok-nim, the police have arrived at Eunhyeong-dong T-junction. They'll find you soon. Hang on a bit longer. What's that? Where's that sound coming from? You two... start at the alley there and search all the way down here. Radio me if anything comes up. -Okay. -You come with me. Yes, sir. Sergeant Mu, I don't feel good about this. -Do you think she's here? -See the camera? We're running out of time. Keep searching. Something with colors. Hey, go that way. Bok-nim? I'm going downstairs. What do you mean? Go back and stay put. The police will arrive soon. I don't think he's around. I'm going out. Don't, Bok-nim. He'll be back any minute. -Stay put. -I'm sure there isn't anyone here. What should I do? I think he's back. Hide somewhere. Hurry. Where did she go? Bok-nim, are you okay? Yes. I think he's going up to the third floor. This is the Call Center. It's an emergency. The abductor is in the building with the victim. Please hurry. {\an8}-What did you find? -Nothing, sir. {\an8}FIVE MINUTES AFTER THE EUNHYEONG-DONG CASE CALL Do you know any place in the neighborhood with colorful paintings or signs? Do you know any place with colorful paintings? Do you know any place around here with colorful murals or signs? This way. Excuse me, ma'am. Tell me. Do you know any place in this area with colorful murals or signs? -Colorful murals? -Yes. With a lot of colors. There is a daycare center in the alley that went out of business recently. It has flowers painted on the walls. Painted flowers? I feel sorry for the director of the center. He hired inexperienced drivers to save money. One of them sexually assaulted the kids at the center. That's why it went out of business. Which direction is it? This is Division One. We know where the suspect is. We got additional information about the location. It has a mural with flowers. It was a daycare center. We're heading there now. Sergeant Mu, do you see any signs? Any outdoor LED signs? Jeez! Stop talking nonsense. What kind of daycare center has that? He's right. There's no way it would have that. What's wrong with me? Bok-nim, the police seem to have found out where you are. -It's almost over. Hang on, okay? -Are you sure? I'm sorry. I should've listened to you. My mom always told me to stay out of trouble and behave. That something... I'd regret could happen someday. She was absolutely right. It's okay, Bok-nim. We all make mistakes. I've also made a huge mistake in the past. No matter how scared and hurt you are, don't give up or run away. You can get a second chance. Ask for forgiveness and start over. You should never give up. Understand? Bok-nim? It's something made of iron. What is it? Is it an iron pipe? No. It's something with a round edge. Let me hear a bit more. Bok-nim? Gwon-ju. Are you okay? I think he's gone now. Sergeant Mu, is that it? Is there a mural with flowers? WE WON'T LEAVE Bok-nim, did he go downstairs? The police officers are on their way. Yes. It seems like he's downstairs. Great. I'm relieved. The abductor is on the first floor. Make sure to arrest him. Things are going too smooth. The abductor has probably committed a series of other crimes. He's tenaciously chasing the victim who ran away. And he has a weapon. Oh! I remember now. You has asked me earlier if he was carrying something. It wasn't a bag. He had a long wooden stick with something attached to it. A long wooden stick... with something attached to it? It looked like a bat or something. Is it possibly a stone hammer? Butchers use those to kill animals. {\an8}She was found a month ago with a dented skull in Gojeong-dong, I was right. -What the... -Police? -Why are they here? -That's not the place. He's a murder suspect. He's not the one who sexually abused kids at the daycare center. Bok-nim, get out of there right now! Bok-nim. Bok-nim. There you are. Bok-nim. Bok-nim! EUNHYEONG-DONG REDEVELOPMENT AREA Bok-nim. Be quiet! -Go that way. -Yes, sir. This is an update. The suspect attacked the victim. He's moving her. I repeat. The victim is being moved somewhere. He may be the suspect of other serial crimes. -Be on your guard. -Hey! What are you talking about? My guess was right. What the suspect swung is a stone hammer that's used by butchers to kill animals. The Gojeong-dong murder -was also committed by a stone hammer. -What are you talking about? My team is out there to catch the killer! The suspect isn't a first-time offender. The suspect couldn't have dismembered the body otherwise. Listen, Ms. Kang. If you do things like this, you can lose your job. This is why I'm against the Golden Time Team! It's me. What? All right. Sir, the suspect of the Gojeong-dong case, Jang Cheol-su, was arrested. The thing is, he has an alibi. What? Send backup right now! Send all members to the scene right now. Send them out now! He had the audacity to kill people with a hammer. Maybe he was trying to find empty places covered in a blind spot, not the redevelopment area where many workers come and go. A place where the he can easily kill people, take his time,  and dismember the bodies. I saw something with colors. Something with colors. What could it be? And what's that sound? What is it? I think I heard it before. A dragging sound. {\an8}MOMMY'S CHICKEN COIN WASH {\an8}NAKWON VILLA Is it... Sergeant Mu, I know what it is. The colors and the sound. It's a barber pole. What are you saying? Bok-nim is in a building that has a barbershop. The abductor has a stone hammer. Any piece of misinformation can confuse us and lead to the victim's death. I know it's hard to believe, but you should trust me. You know that the victim of the Gojeong-dong case was murdered with a round-edge weapon. We lost the suspect of the Gojeong-dong case. People can't believe the victim's head was cracked open. It's a total mess. I'm sure the sound was from a barber pole. I do not want to see another person die on my watch. Not again. Yes. It's the barber pole. That's what she saw. -Those are the colors she saw. -Exactly. There's no time. Hurry! EUNHYEONG BARBERSHOP Don't kill me. You're awake? How do you want to die? Please... don't kill me. I have to go home too. I'll make it quick. Bok-nim. TEN MINUTES AFTER THE EUNHYEONG-DONG CASE CALL {\an8}SPECIAL THANKS TO JO JAE-YOON AND LEE JUN-HYEOK What's that sound? She's always talking about sounds, just like she did three years ago. Help me. I'm so scared. We found a possible suspect. A-ram is in there somewhere. You have to find him. Where is it? It's the wrong place. Help me. Mr. Mu is in danger.
