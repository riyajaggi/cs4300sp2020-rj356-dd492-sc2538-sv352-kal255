 {\an8}This is the verse from the Bible. {\an8}The culprit thinks of himself as an executioner. {\an8}He must think he's like the God who punished the sinful city of Sodom. {\an8}That's what crazy guys typically say online. {\an8}I researched on the mirror placed in front of the dead body. {\an8}It could allude to the next target. {\an8}The ones reflected in the mirror are the next target. {\an8}Like this. Yes, Dad. A call? I must've missed it because I was asleep. I was a bit tired.

 Okay, bye. This incident was also discovered by Kang Gwon-ju and Mu Jin-hyeok, from Golden Time Team, which Sungun Metropolitan Police Agency has recently founded. {\an8}They also promised further cooperation on the investigation. Despite the doubts that were raised when Golden Time Team was founded, they have shown stellar results, solving the Eunhyeong-dong case and the Burim-dong case within the golden hour, dispelling the initial worries. Meanwhile, Sungun Metropolitan Police Agency  is confident they will catch the culprit, Nam, after having found his fingerprints on the victim's phone. However, they are being criticized for failing to protect the victim. Find out where Sang-tae is hiding now.

 And tell Commissioner Bae to come here. Yes, sir. -This is the 112 Emergency Call Center. -Location? -Okay. -The intersection? The Sulim-dong case investigation seems to be going badly. I heard that the culprit damaged the body. Oh, my. It's really scary. Did you give her the data you found? The Violent Crimes Unit thinks the culprit is Nam Sang-tae. Why does Ms. Kang want more information? There's something more to this case. Ms. Kang and Mr. Mu could be investigating secretly. It'd be easier if I looked into social media. It's driving me up the wall. Isn't it concerning to upload personal photos on social media? You are a police officer. You might be misunderstood. You're too old-fashioned, Officer Park. Communication without pretense brings the world together. You know? Those who don't own as much as you do might be hurt from seeing what you have. Are you concerned about me? In that case, if you have time, come watch my DJ show. I'm not concerned about you. You are reacting to my "JK" again. Come on, Officer Oh. Please go ahead. What do you mean, "JK"? Speed is key when you're researching information. That's why I use a lot of abbreviations. "ANP" stands for "A Nice Picture". For narrow-minded commenters, I call them "VNV". "Very Narrow Viewers." Anyhow, come if you get a chance. It's called Club Fever. You can bring your friends. So you must remain vigilant at all times. I keep sensing that something is going wrong. The culprit of the Eunhyeong-dong incident is likely after us, just like we're after him. Mr. Shim Yeong-un. Your sister... won't be able to come for a while. Don't lie. My sister keeps her promises. She told me that I should also keep my promises. She said earlier she'll come back soon to bring my clothes. What's wrong? Did something happen to my sister? Mr. Shim. Where's my sister? Where's my sister? -Mr. Shim! -Chun-ok! -Calm down. -Chun-ok! -Chun-ok, where are you? -Mr. Shim, calm down. Chun-ok! Your sister wanted me to give this to you. She told me that this is your favorite. I told you. She would never leave me alone. If I tell you the truth, will you protect Yeong-un and me? Will you? You... murdered Shim Chun-ok in our faces. I will arrest you no matter what. Where are you going? I'll give you a ride -if we're going the same way. -It's okay. I have to go to help my grandmother at the diner. I see. Oh, my. You are adorable. Where's your owner? Maybe someone abandoned him. Did you know that regions with more abandoned dogs have higher crime rates? -I read it in a book. -No, but it does sound likely. By the way, you seem to read a lot. You're always reading something. Let's take a picture together. Look over here. I'm going to upload this. Then, my followers will also be interested in dogs. Do you want to go to my place? {\an8}CERTIFICATE OF DEATH SUNGUN METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY Hey, sweetheart. Are you not coming today? I'm sorry. I'm still at work. I can't make it today. You go to sleep first. You lied again. It's not like that. I'll go play with you tomorrow. I'm going to seal it now. Satisfied? I'll be there tomorrow. Dong-u, it's time for your medicine now. You said you'll take it after 30 minutes. Dong-u, didn't you take your medicine yet? It's getting late. Hurry up. Here you go. -Here goes the medicine. -Open up. -It's inside now. -Come on. I don't like it. I'm proud of you, son. Go to bed early. -Sweet dreams. -Okay. PERSONAL DETAILS Was it you who killed my wife? Yes, I killed your wife. Your dead wife won't come back to life no matter what you do. It only makes your life miserable. Nam Sang-tae, this scum. If he's not the culprit, why did he say that he killed Ji-hye? Why? Sir, I'm sorry I kept you waiting. I canceled the dinner and left right away, but-- Commissioner Bae, sort out the Sulim-dong case as soon as possible. -It's such a headache. -I'm aware. I was trying my best, but another case broke out. I'm in such a bind at the moment. Plus, even his fingerprints have been found. That jerk, Nam Sang-tae, is just like his father. He's an extremely cruel man. What can I do, though? His father and I are indebted to each other. Hence, I wouldn't be comfortable with putting him behind bars. I want to send him to Japan instead. I actually just spoke to Chief Prosecutor Park on the phone. I see. -Understood. -One more thing. It looks like you've gotten quite big-headed lately. I just want to remind you how important it is to know your place. Sure, you want to be the police that fights for democracy and justice. I know that, of course. But the justice of the world... is just not valid in the city of Sungun. Do you get it? I'm aware, sir. I'll take care of everything. Let's go. Nam Sang-tae, that rat. Where on earth is he hiding? Seriously. I took a nap for ten minutes and had a dream about that jerk. What is going on here? Jin-hyeok slept here like this? Goodness. I'd be glad if he doesn't drive us crazy about Nam Sang-tae. I wonder what he's fixated on now. Gosh, has this place been turned into a motel or what? Guys, shouldn't you be charging him? Jin-hyeok, wake up. Jin-hyeok! Jin-hyeok, wake up already. What's up? I have something to tell you. What is it? I'm telling you that it looks like he has caught onto it. Cut it out! Stop talking rubbish. When Mu Jin-hyeok is fixated on a target, he always tracks it down no matter how far he has to go. If the thing about Fantasia gets revealed, I don't know what I'll do. Consider yourself informed. Fantasia... Are you sure he said "Fantasia"? Yes, I heard it loud and clear. Think about it. He can't afford to go to that expensive bar. I heard it costs over five million won to just book a table there. There is something, don't you think? Let's not tell anyone else about this for the time being. Of course. We don't know it for certain yet. Telling people about it will only get me into deep trouble. What has he gotten himself into? I'll keep digging. You do the same. And make sure Chief Jang doesn't find out. SOSO SASHIMI HOUSE Come in. This is wild-caught halibut. It's really good. Try it. I've lived... long enough to know that life never goes exactly as planned. I know that you got into this mess while trying to help my business. Do you want to go to Japan or China? Just go and run one of our dummy companies. I'll help you come back when things quiet down a little. Sir, even if I'm... It's so easy for you to cut ties. What? How dare you say such a thing? You still haven't grown out of your volatile temper. That's what got you into this mess. What did I tell you? I asked you to be patient. Then you could've gotten one of our subsidiaries as I promised. And seriously, Sang-tae. Have you forgotten all your father has been through? You cannot be doing this to me. Put it there. Leave in two days. There's cash inside. It should be enough. You won't be able to walk around like this in a few days. Go and run whatevver business you want. Sounds good? PASSPORT You're asking me to disappear, right? I'll do it on one condition. I must kill Mu Jin-hyeok before I leave. I'm going to send a hitman to the hospital where that scum's son is in a bit. You fool. Even a lowly beast would know not to lay a finger on its enemy's cub. You'll get it all back and more. I'm already in this mess. Nothing scares me. You really are Nam Gu-hang's son after all. Your father will be very proud of you. SUNGUN METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY I saw a man in a luxurious suit beating up an old police officer. He was... hitting him with a dreadful-looking iron ball. He said the murder weapon was an iron ball with a handle. The method has gotten even crueler than three years ago. Where did he get it? I beg your pardon? {\an8}If you keep this up, you'll have to stand trial {\an8}for violating the Minor Offences Act. {\an8}Come on. You sound even sexier in your angry voice. What's your title there? Would you meet me in a bit? This call is being recorded. If you're going to keep doing this, I'll have to send out a patrol. Hello? It's that guy from Hwami-dong, right? He certainly has made it to our blacklist. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you need my help with anything. I'm just realizing now that Officer Oh is off today. That's why it's been so quiet here. By the way, what is Ms. Kang so engrossed in? She's about to shoot laser beams out of her eyes. SUNGUN METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY What is this? Come and have a look at this. What is it? Is this true? That can't be. What are you guys doing? Don't slack off. {\an8}OH HYEON-HO IS A JUNKIE AND A MURDERER. HE DOESN'T DESERVE A POLICE BADGE HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE HIGH SCHOOL GANG, BLACK, DID DRUGS AND WAS A BULLY. {\an8}HE HACKED A CLASSMATE'S EMAIL ACCOUNT. IT MADE HIM TAKE HIS OWN LIFE Officer Park, contact whoever runs the bulletin board to delete it. -Call the Management Team. -Yes, sir. You run the bulletin board? This is 112. There is a strange post about an officer on the public bulletin board. Ms. Kang. Here. A posting about Officer Oh went around on police intranet. HR is going to see if it's true. This wasn't on his resume or in his personal history. It was hard to go as far as high school years in the US. There is a high chance that it's a rumor. Is Officer Oh off today? -Yes. -Give him a call. Okay. Come if you get a chance. It's called Club Fever. SCOPOLAMINE Scopolamine. A medication used to decrease nerve signals to treat motion sickness. Side effects are mydriasis, hallucination, neuroparalysis, and short-term memory loss. A hallucinogen? KARAOKE BAR CLUB FEVER Yes. I just got here. When would I get to DJ at Club Fever if I don't fill in for someone? Yes, of course. Do you know how hard I worked on my set list? Yes. Okay. I'll be right there. The person you're calling is on another line. He's not picking up. If you look here, there is a copy of the record from an American police agency saying that he was a suspect. It must be fake, right? {\an8}It's easy to forge such a thing these days. Let us not make a big fuss until we confirm the facts. I understand. LOVE8080: YOUR HAIR LOOKS GREAT TODAY, BUT CHANGE THE WAX I WANT TO HANG YOUR PRETTY FINGERS ON MY WALL What's wrong with her? My goodness. I'm your biggest fan. Can I get your autograph? Of course. -What's your name? -Lee Na-rae. You're so beautiful. How can you be so good at DJing and be kind, too? Most of the time, popular DJs don't want to give autographs. You're prettier in my eyes. Thank you. I'm going to pass this on to my children. Thank you. My gosh, I know you. You're Black, right? You're super popular on social media. You're a police officer, but you DJ and go party with your friends. You go bar hopping all the time. You're so cool. I'm so jealous of you. Thank you. I'll see you in there. -Yes, okay. -Great. Bye. Who are you? I'm filling in for Red Touch. I'm DJ Black. I've been your fan for a long time. -You're filling in today? -Yes. Too bad. I don't like people that do music as a hobby. We're all musicians. Why put distance between us. Should I get you a coffee? You're tiring me out. Boss. Boss. What? What is it? -What is it? -Do you call any DJs now? What is it now? Come on. Let's go out. -Hey. Drink some. -Okay. OH HYEON-HO Gosh. Nothing is going my way today. It's been so long. I'm so nervous. What's wrong with me? You didn't... What is it? Black, isn't it what you like the most? Give it up for your DJ. Are you guys having fun? -Yes! -Yes! I can't hear you. Yes. This is Club Fever! I'll introduce you to a new DJ. From Los Angeles, it's DJ Black. Come on! Gosh. He has a knife! {\an8}-This is 112 Emergency Call Center. -We have an emergency. {\an8}A crazy man took a woman hostage and is trying to stab people. A man? Can you tell us where you are? -Tell us how old you think he is. -Well, I'm at Fever. Club Fever in Gwangchang-dong. The man must be in his late 20s or early 30s. Ms. Kang, there is a hostage situation with a young man in his 20s or 30s in Club Fever of Gwangchang-dong. Fever? Fever... I'm going to backup the call -so don't hang up. -Okay. What kind of weapon does the suspect have? It's a knife. He was coming up to the DJ but was staggering. He jumped into the crowd with a knife. He must be on drugs. His eyes are unfocused. -Don't move. -What's wrong with you? I said don't move! If you move, she'll die. Okay? Do you understand? Don't you move an inch. Pardon? A club DJ is on a rampage? You think he's on drugs? -A disturbance at a club? -A rampage? I can't quite hear you. He's holding a knife? Ms. Kang, we're getting multiple calls about a knife incident at Club Fever in Gwangchang-dong. Someone shot a video. -Play it. -Okay. {\an8}CALL DESK Isn't that Officer Oh? Come if you get a chance. It's called Club Fever. Ms. Kang. Actually, Officer Oh told me yesterday that he's filling in for a DJ at Club Fever today. -Call him right now. -Okay. The number you're calling... His phone is turned off. Don't move! If you move, she'll die. Okay? I'm certain that's Officer Oh's voice. This is Code Zero. A man is threatening a woman in her 20s with a knife at Club Fever in 21 Gwangchang-dong. It looks like the man is highly drugged at the moment. We presume the man to be... Officer Oh Hyeon-ho of 112 Center. What are you talking about? Why is he at a club right now? There is a video online of what happened at the club. Officer Park says she heard him say that he will be DJing at a club today. There was also a post on the police bulletin board today that slanders Officer Oh. It says during his time in the US, he was a drug addict and a suspect of a murder case. However, we have yet to confirm anything. Gosh, this is crazy. I'm mobilizing right now. Okay. -He's crazy. -What are we going to do? {\an8}My gosh, it's so scary. -Move back. Don't go inside. -What do we do? Mr. Mu. There could be a misunderstanding. Please try communicating first. Don't worry. He's my colleague, too. Okay. Ms. Kang. He looked really shy to me. Club, drugs, and a knife, what a package. Hey, what if he gets fired today? That's not important right now. We have to make sure no one gets hurt. Don't worry. What do you mean, he takes medication? The bottle was definitely labeled scopolamine. I looked it up online, and it's a very poisonous new drug. Also, here. I was worried so I called the LA Police Department, and asked about what happened at his school. It was true. Someone by the name Matthew Han committed suicide. Also, a Korean boy named Michael Oh was seen as a person of interest. Okay. Thank you for letting me know. Let's not jump to conclusions yet. Yes, ma'am. I see Gwangchang-dong's night club street. I'll be there in 30 seconds. If we sum up what the reports say, Officer Oh came to fill in for a DJ named Red Touch. He already seemed weird while walking up to the stage. There is a possibility that the rumor about his school days is true. What? Then how did he become a police officer? I don't know how much of it is true. According to the posting, Officer Oh's father is very influential in Sungun and that's how his history was overlooked. Hey, was Officer Oh always a bit weird? You know, computer geniuses tend to be weird. My goodness. If she dies because of you, it'll make you happy, right? Wouldn't it feel great? You better not move while I'm being nice. I'll kill her. If she dies, who will be next? Aren't you curious? So don't move. Over there. Do you see it? Stop recording. Please step back. Stop it. -Come on. -Move further back, please. -How is it in there? -Hello. It's very small and narrow. Since people are drinking, we fear secondary damage. What a mess. -Let's go inside. Block them. -Okay. -Block them and follow me. -Okay. This is going to be tough. This is Team One. We're entering the club. Don't come near! Oh Hyeon-ho. Stop and put the knife down! Hyeon-ho, don't do what you'll regret. Put that knife down. Come on. Don't come near me. Don't come near me! This is high color laser. High color laser. All right. I got it. Put it away. Down. Happy? This is high color laser. Put that knife down. Now. High color laser. Dae-sik. What is he saying anyway? I think he's saying high color laser. He's completely out of it. Okay, our guns are down. Hyeon-ho, let's put that knife down. Come on. Let's go. Don't come. Don't! This is high color laser. High color laser. High color laser. Don't come near. His diction and breathing are abnormal. He keeps dragging his right foot as well. I can tell he's not himself even with bare eyes. He's definitely high on drugs. Please save me. Hey, I don't know why you're doing this, but let's talk. Let's talk it out. Don't come near me. Just don't. I get it. You must have a reason for doing this. I'll hear you out. Just put the knife down. That's why I said, high color laser. It's on the desk but you people are still clueless. Talk so we can understand, will you? High color laser. High color laser. Don't come near me. Don't! If you do, this place will turn into a sea of fire. Don't. Don't come close. Ms. Kang, did you hear him? Can you interpret it? He's trying to talk in codes. He's giving us codes. -Try to figure out. -Okay. Officer Park. High color laser... What could it be? HIGH COLOR LASER COLOR LASER PRINTER Ms. Kang, there isn't such a thing called high color laser. High color laser. High color laser? HCL? Speed is key when you're researching information. That's why I use a lot of abbreviations. ANP is "A Nice Picture". He said he uses abbreviations. What does HCL stand for? Ms. Kang. Could he be talking about hydrochloric acid? The molecular formula for hydrochloric acid is HCL. -I think he's trying to talk in codes. -Hydrochloric acid? Now that I think about it... Don't come near me. Don't! If you do, this place will turn into a sea of fire. Mr. Mu, it's possible HCL stands for hydrochloric acid. There must be hydrochloric acid in this club. Yes, that seems likely. -Dae-sik. -Yes? Come here. I think someone threatened him to pour hydrochloric acid. That means the person that threatened him is here? I'll look for the hydrochloric acid while talking to him. You should look for the person who threatened him. Okay. He said it's on the desk, right? Hyeon-ho. I said stay away. Why do you keep coming? All right. I get it. You're doing this because of Ms. Kang. That's why I said, just go. Go. You're doing this because you don't like her. She keeps repeating herself. You already heard her, but she keeps repeating and that annoys you. I know. She has a horrible personality. She's tedious and inflexible. No one would enjoy working under her. I know. Exactly. So what I'm saying is-- Up there. Up there. I'm talking about Ms. Kang. Team Two. Culprit caught in the act. Hydrochloric acid on ceilings. Controller behind the stage. I'll count to three. Hyeon-ho, when I count to three, put the knife down and we'll go back to the station. It's okay, kid. I'll make sure you get out of it. I'll count to three, okay? Hyeon-ho. Just count to three. One. Two. Let go! There's hydrochloric acid on the ceiling. Run! Hyeon-ho! Go! Where did you go? Stop right there! Requesting paramedics. Take him outside. The suspect of the acid attack at Club Fever is running toward 21 Gwangchang-dong. Female, 170cm. White coat and black fishnet stockings. Go after her! What? Where did she go? How can she be so fast? Is she Usain Bolt or something? Have you seen a woman with long, curly hair? Have you seen a woman in a white coat running? Have you seen a woman in a white coat running? Hey, Dae-sik! Gosh, darn it. -Hey! -Over there! Darn it! You go that way. Hey, stop! What is this? Is this a wig? You were going to be caught anyway. Why did you run? You just wasted our energy. You're under arrest for attempted murder... What is this? It was a man? Why are you doing this to me? Oh, my. Who are you? Why did you do this? Arrest him, Dae-sik. Come here. {\an8}This is Team One. We have the hydrochloric acid terrorist. {\an8}The culprit is... {\an8}a male cross-dresser. I'll bring him to the station. -Bring him. -Stand up. Please move out. Please make way. There has been a hostage situation at a club in Gwangchang-dong. Golden Time Team has brought the situation under control. The hostage situation led to an acid attack. -Quickly. -Do you have anything to say? What are you doing? -I'm sorry. -It wasn't me. -I'm sorry. -It wasn't me! Quickly. -It wasn't me. -Take him in. {\an8}This is the work of Love8080. {\an8}8:40 PM ONE HOUR AND 40 MINUTES AFTER THE CLUB FEVER HOSTAGE SITUATION {\an8}I don't know if she has an accomplice, But she stalked me and did this to me. So you are saying that the SNS user named Love8080 has been stalking you for a year? Yes, that's right. I keep telling you. When girls left comments, she replied harshly and she even pasted my face on porn. I mentioned visiting a ski resort once on my social media, and she called the resort to ask them to look after me, saying I'm her boyfriend. And today.  I don't know how she found out I would be DJing. but she left comments as if she was by my side. It's so creepy. Your hair looks really good today. I won't forgive you if you make eye contact with other girls. I just ignored the comments and went inside. It's been so long. I'm so nervous. I thought a woman was coming in. I was so surprised. It's the men's room. When I looked closely, she looked weird. Love8080 sent me. If you don't do as Love8080 says, she will drop the hydrochloric acid. Why didn't you listen to me? I said I won't forgive you if you make eye contact with other girls. Hydrochloric acid? Love8080 said she put drugs in your drink. She won't kill you if you do as you are told. So... do as you are told. Love8080 set me up to ruin me. She acts all cute to me, but the cartoons and slangs she refers to are from the early 2000s. I'm certain it's a woman in her 40s. {\an8}She kept sending me the picture with her face hidden under the umbrella. She's probably paranoid and delusional. But why didn't you track her IP address? You're an expert. I couldn't because it's illegal to track IP addresses for personal use. She kept changing her username and reappearing. There is a program that hides your IP address. I think she's using that. Look. {\an8}WHY DIDN'T YOU DO AS YOU WERE TOLD? I WILL KILL YOU Look at this. Then what was the post on the bulletin board? That doesn't make sense either. A gang member? Do you know how scary Black is? I never went near them. I added "black" to my username simply because it sounded cool. And Matthew died of a car accident. I was mistaken for Michael Oh who was investigated. I'm not involved in any way. This was all done by Love8080. Please catch that crazy woman. She'll make me go insane. All right. Calm down. Don't get worked up. Relax. So Ms. Kang, the one who calls himself Surprise also claims to have been hired by Love8080. Yes. This is the information on Surprise, whose real name is Yang Ho-sik. Surprise. So his name is Yang Ho-sik? Okay. I'll go see him. Love8080 told me it's water, not hydrochloric acid. Yang Ho-sik, are you saying that makes it okay? You are 27 years old and old enough to understand. According to article 324 of Criminal Law, you can be sentenced to up to five years in prison. What should I do with you? Why's the door like this? I should have smashed this door before. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Yang Ho-sik. -Ho-sik. -Yes? Did you say you are sorry? You are sorry? Don't you get how serious this is? You could have killed someone. Ho-sik, look at me. Love8080. Love8080. Look, he's reacting to it. It's him. It's your username, right? I can tell. Write Love8080 next to his name. Detective, it wasn't me. She hired me. You'll see when you check it later. I kept the emails we exchanged. I even captured the chat windows. I just did what she told me to do. Do you know what your mistake was? How do you know if Love8080 is a woman or a man? You've never met in person. That is... I never had a girlfriend before because of my job and my personality. I'm so timid that I can't talk to people. That's why I went into the revenge exchange website whenever something frustrated me. It's an anonymous website. I felt better after reading about the revenge stories of others. One day, someone sent me a message. It was her. Let's be friends. She told me she's a 33-year-old female, who is unmarried. She even sent me a picture. I couldn't see her face, but she had a nice body and she sounded cute. I couldn't stop myself from talking to her on the website. -Hey. -Then... I didn't say I won't give it to you. I will give it to you later. Later! My boss owed me three million won for the electricity construction, but he kept refusing to pay me. So I got really angry. You know how significant three million won is for people like us. Please throw some food waste on the guy who ran away without paying me for the electrical work. Right then, Love8080 started talking to me. She said she also wanted to teach someone a lesson and suggested we could exchange our revenge. He was so desperate to date me at first, but he then cheated on me. Bastard. Let me make him pay for what he did. Let's meet up and come up with a plan together. Then come to the back alley of Club Fever on January 28. But that's where I'm doing electrical work these days. I prepared costumes for your disguise so don't worry. So we decided to meet. So you met her? Did you? No, she didn't come. I even put on new clothes and waited for her. {\an8}Do as it's written in here. If things work out, let's go on a date. {\an8}She asked me to threaten the guy, saying the water I have is acid. But to be honest, I wasn't sure if I could do it. So I was hesitating. But then, I got a phone call from an unknown number. Hello? This is Love8080. I like your suit. Please do a good job. Love8080. I'm not so sure because it was a very short conversation, but she sounded older than I had imagined. She sounded like a woman in her late 30s to 40s. He's trying to confuse us. You can tell, right? I don't see what the point of your story is. Right. Her voice. Her voice was a little echoing. You know, just like when you talk in a basement. Basement? So what? In retrospect, I think... she was trying to use me on purpose since I have easy access to the ceiling of Fever. I should've known better. I'm not good enough to date someone or be in a relationship. I'm so sorry for what I did. STATEMENT RECORDING ROOM So? I checked all the comments and emails he and Love8080 exchanged. They said that the IP addresses are different. It didn't seem deliberate. Forensics checked the wires on the ceiling of the club and they were installed just like he described. According to the Violent Crimes Unit... there's nothing special about him. What should we do? Let's keep an eye on him without detention. -Okay. -Anyway, take some clothes from the night-duty room and tell him to put them on. How poorly did you manage your team that this has happened? I didn't give you the authority over human resources so you could let this happen. I understand, sir. But the officer was also threatened... We'll arrest the culprit and close the case as soon as possible. Ms. Kang, you don't seem to understand how serious this is. Whoever the culprit is, this incident has already damaged the reputation of Sungun Metropolitan Police Agency. COMMISSIONER BAE BYEONG-GON Forget it. I'm considering withdrawing Golden Time Team anyway. The Violent Crimes Unit will be in charge of the Sulim-dong incident. If I ever hear that you were on the scene or that you interfered with their investigation again, you'd have to worry about losing your title. Commissioner Bae seems to be getting more and more nervous as we get closer to the culprit. He must be involved somehow. -This is Kang Gwon-ju. -This is Cybercrimes Unit. We've confirmed the user information of Love8080 who instigated the acid threat in Gwangchang-dong. Kang Mi-suk, 43-year-old woman. We've confirmed she got restraining orders from many younger men. We've also confirmed she recently purchased a lot of acid. One interesting thing is that her IP address is from an internet cafe at 79 Jiseo-ro, Jiseo-dong, Sungun, which is not the area she actually lives in. The user is currently online with the same IP address. Mr. Mu, we've just confirmed the IP address of the suspect of the Gwangchang-dong incident. The location is 79 Jiseo-ro, Jiseo-dong, Sungun. -Her personal information? -Her name is Kang Mi-suk. 43 years old. She's been living unsociably after her divorce and has numerous records of stalking. It's also been confirmed she bought a lot of acid recently. The information seems to match Officer Oh's profiling result. All right, we'll leave now. We just confirmed the address of the suspect who threatened Officer Oh. Everyone, get ready. Yes, ma'am. {\an8}SULIM-DONG ACID THREAT Thank you. You're not imprisoned this time, but don't do anything like exchanging revenge again. Note that you could be called again since the culprit hasn't been arrested. Sure, I know. Detectives. I'm sorry and thank you. This is Team One. By the way, Detective. Where is Officer Oh? I'd like to apologize to him before I leave. I'm afraid you can't. Why don't you come back when the case is closed? Okay. I understand. You found her IP address? Yes, it's 79 Jiseo-ro, Jiseo-dong, Sungun. Mr. Mu is now on the way. Don't worry. We will catch the culprit. Thank you. I was so frustrated I thought of tracking her down myself. Yes. All right, ma'am. That psycho. You're going to be stuck in prison for the rest of your life. How dare you threaten a police officer? Officer Oh. I'm released now, so I came to apologize. -Okay. -I'm sorry. Don't be. You got tricked as well. By a sick psycho. May I have a seat? Sure. Thank you so much for your understanding. You're welcome. By the way... You're really handsome. I hear that from time to time. You're also very handsome. Did you hear? They are on their way to catch the crazy woman. Finally, the police will teach the psycho a lesson. You know how it feels when you get a rock out of your shoe? That's how I feel right now. I'm glad to hear that. Right. Goodness, she's over 40. Why would she do such a thing? This is unbelievable. Hey, age has nothing to with crimes. By the way, something doesn't feel right. Let's get going. Let's go. I think we should crack down on all the stalkers one day. Look. What kind of person would do this? I agree. It's all over now. Please calm down. Come on. How lame does she have to be to do something like this? I'm sure she has been bothering others her entire life. I can't wait until she's arrested. I agree. Although... I pity Love8080 a little. She only did those things because she likes you. Because she likes me? She did this because she liked me? That's nonsense! Why would she sexually harass me and leave weird comments if she liked me? I don't think so. You're right. I agree with everything you just said. She shouldn't have done that. Officer Oh. Officer Park. What brings you here? I was... I need to ask you something. Can we talk in private? Yes, sure. I'm sorry, but we're not supposed to talk about our cases in front of civilians. Of course. I understand. It must be something important. I'm sorry for interrupting you. I should get going. What was that? He got upset because I told him to get out? I doubt it. He seems really gentle. So what do you want to talk about? The IP address traced by the Cybercrimes Unit. Are you sure it's Kang Mi-suk? I'm sure it's her. Kang Mi-suk's personal data matches what I know of Love8080. -Why are you asking me that? -What? -All of a sudden? -Well, I'm just... Right, the Violent Crimes Unit has no data on the recent hydrochloric acid attacks. Where can I get it? You'll find it in the basement archive. I'm sensing something. Something's going on, right? Tell me what it is. Have you... ever heard of De Clerambault Syndrome before? De Clerambault Syndrome? No, I've never heard of it before. {\an8}It's also called erotomania. {\an8}It's a delusional disorder where you believe {\an8}that someone with higher status loves you. It's like you're obsessed with receiving attention. It's one of the most dangerous mental disorders. There was an acid attack on a singer last year in Hwami-dong, and the acid attack on a lawyer in Burim-dong. We haven't caught the culprits yet. I believe the attacks were carried out by someone with De Clerambault Syndrome. But Kang Mi-suk has nothing to do with these cases. No. The Cybercrimes Unit said she bought a lot of hydrochloric acid earlier. She's working for a cleaning company. She bought it under her name, but her company paid for it and had it delivered there. Still, since we have the IP address, the team will have to go and see. So you're saying the culprit might be someone else, right? I wouldn't put it like that, but... You know I'm a bookworm. I just got curious because I've read so many books. Here you are. -Is this for me? -See you later. I didn't know... she was this warm-hearted. All right. Forget Love8080. I've been letting you off for too long. Gosh. RESTRICTED AREA Why are there no documents? -Please move out. -Go inside. What are you doing? -I'm sorry. -It wasn't me. It wasn't me! -I really didn't do it. -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The tone of his voice changed even though he said the same words. The first one was of a man who is sorry. The other one sounded completely different. He sounded pleasant. As if he were complimented. What's this? Someone installed a bug to block me? WARNING This isn't something a woman in her 40s can do. Nice! I got you. Love8080. I'll make sure you can never talk to anyone. What's this? Why is the IP address... different? Ms. Kang said it's 79 Jiseo-ro, Jiseo-dong, Sungun. "Fix Everything Electrical." Where did I see it? No way. Is it... FIX EVERYTHING ELECTRICAL YANG HO-SIK "We fix everything." I pity Love8080 a little. She only did those things because she likes you. You creep. -Hello? -Ms. Kang. It's not Kang Mi-suk. We got it all wrong. It's Yang Ho-sik who claimed to have been given orders by Love8080. What are you talking about, Officer Oh? Calm down and explain clearly. Well, it's not that simple... I need to ask you something. Can we talk in private? Officer Park. She's in danger. He must be a lunatic with De Clerambault Syndrome or something. We must catch him now! No way. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No wonder he sounded different. He got excited by the thought of Officer Oh looking at him. PARK EUN-SU This is 112 Center. The culprit of the acid attack is Yang Ho-sik, not Kang Mi-suk. Officer Park is at the archives downstairs. It seems he followed her there. It's all your fault. I'm just going to pour it on your face. Gwangchang Patrol, are you not there yet? Come quickly. I think a suspicious man is with my son now. Who are you? Dad! I have great expectations for Ghost.
