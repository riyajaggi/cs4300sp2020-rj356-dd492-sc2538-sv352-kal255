 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [theme music playing] [Wajih] The opening of the bank is in two weeks, and our name has to be number one in the market. [alarm ringing] [faucet running] I want to establish a friendly relationship with the client through an advertisement idea that can be summed up in two words, that's all. Mr. Wajih? I have an idea that might save you another meeting with us. What's this?

 This is a one-dollar bill, so it could be in the hands of any person in the country. We'll release it, and it will pass from one hand to another and go from one pocket to the next. And the owner of the bill with the right number will win a valuable prize from the bank. [Wajih] One million dollars. [cell phone ringing] Hello, Mr. Wajih? No, no, not at all. It's fine. I'm listening. What resignation, Mr. Wajih? Even if I wanted to resign, I wouldn't do it this way. But I'm still on leave.

 Mr. Wajih, I have a family situation, and... Hello? Hello? Huh? Is there someone I can call right now to bring me some money, so you'll get out of my face? Huh? Answer me! Fuck this, man! You want him to rat on us? Let's hear him out! Stop arguing, you two! For God's sake, can't you hear what this idiot is saying? He thinks he's Rambo or something. He wants to take a hostage and start calling people! I swear, he's going to screw us! I have someone. I have someone. I'll get you the money. But let me go. I swear, I won't tell anyone. Listen, he's already double-crossing you! Go ahead, keep listening to him! What do you want, then? Do you want Hindi's thugs to come and cut off my finger? Will this make things better? [stammers] I have... Shut up, or I'll slit your throat! Calm down! Calm down! Look at me! Kandil! Why don't you go to Hindi and talk to him man to man? Ask him to give you a few more days and save his men those trips over here. Go see him at Kirella. It's the nightclub he owns in Maameltein. Listen to me. I heard his men say that all the business happens there. Buying and selling, receiving and delivering. Go for it. The amount that's missing won't hurt him. You have 75% of what's required, if not more. - Go for it. - Okay, I'll go. Okay, and before you return, we'll take this moron out back and give him a one-way ticket... Me and your brother here. Where do you think you're going? [Kandil] Please, wait! Please, I'm begging you! I'm begging you! I'm begging you! Come on, time to cough up some dough. Yes, dough means money. [man] Hurry up, Kandil, before I knock your lights out. [Kandil] Well, I wanted to talk to you about the money... [man] Hurry, before I rip your head off. I swear, I was on my way to see Hindi about the payment. Please, take me to him. I just want to say one thing to him. I see. So you don't have the money, you miserable piece of shit. I have it! I swear I have it! I swear I have it! But... There's just a little bit missing. Just a little. There's just a little bit missing. But I have it. Look. We held you in high regard, and we gave you the goods, but you proved to be unworthy of it, and you got caught along with your men. When we asked you for the money, you started crying and weeping. But Hindi has a big heart. We said you could pay it in small amounts, but then you started screwing up. We cut off your finger, but you didn't learn your lesson. Now you have an incomplete payment? Just a bit missing. Look at this handful! Look how he's literally raking it in! Look how he's grabbing it, and his hand is big! There are even some euros! Euros! And there are sterling pounds! I swear there's just a little bit missing. Someone talk to him! Talk to him! Guys, I'm begging you! Please! Just let me talk to him! - Wait. - [Kandil] Talk to him... Please! Listen, Kandil, you motherfucker... Yes, I'm listening. [man] It seems you're starting to lie. Today, I'm going to cut off your pinky because you gave us an incomplete payment. But next Thursday, you better have all of it, or else you never know what I could be cutting off. - Hold him. - I beg you! I beg you! I beg you! Please! Please! No! No! [screaming] [screaming continues] [screaming stops] [Tarek] Zeina. Get up. Tarek? Are you okay? Where have you been since yesterday? I was going crazy. What happened to you? Where did you disappear to? [Tarek] Get the keys. [Zeina] I'm glad you're okay. I hope nothing bad ever happens to you. [Tarek] Thank God it's over. I barely survived. Those guys who took me, they're not criminals or thieves. They're much worse. They're fucking murderers. But it's good you were able to escape. They almost killed you. I barely made it. Another second, and I wouldn't even be here right now. And it's all because you doubted me. What? How? How? Because you gave me the teddy bear keys! If you had given me the right keys, I would've had the dollar already. But you were worried I might rip you off! You're the one who doubts me! Or need I remind you how you come in and ruin my plans every time? And why? Because you're worried I may take the million dollars! [Tarek] Anyway, the dollar is gone. It's over. The people who have it are bigger and more dangerous than the ones who captured me. Now, it's with a drug lord called Hindi. He has a club over in Maameltein called Kirella. Everything that's happening to me is like a sign that I should forget about it. Maybe I should forget about this whole dollar thing. And throw away half a million dollars? [sighs] Zeina, it seems that you don't understand what I'm saying. If we keep running after this dollar, we could end up on a wild-goose chase. What good is money if you lose your life? [sighs] You're right. You know what? Sometimes, I also think about going back to my old life and forgetting about this whole thing. Waking up in the morning, drinking coffee, going to work, listening to the same old stories, being thrilled when I get my paycheck and ecstatic when I get a bonus. [clicks tongue] But when I think about it again, I don't know... I feel there's something... I mean... Ever since we started looking for that dollar, there's been something that always makes me... [chuckles softly] - [in French] Good morning. - [in French] Good morning. [sighs] [in Arabic] Your place is really nice and has some great design details. [both sigh] Were you married before? Let's leave it at "good morning." Good morning. I'm going to make coffee. Do you want some? Mmm. [sighs] I'm screwed at work. The manager changed his mind regarding my leave, and they sent me a message from the bank. They're looking for someone to replace me. Ah! What have I done to myself? I mean, why? How am I supposed to fix it now? [Tarek] Well, Wassim, my friend at work, he's been texting me about threats from the manager for some time now. But he hasn't called in two days. Maybe they've fired me, too. Would he really do this to you? Wouldn't he at least tell you? Maybe he took over my position. But I don't think he would do that. And I've been reluctant to call him because he would give me the bad news right away. Do you like camping and hunting and stuff like that? Because I saw a few pictures here in the house. Are you done spying on me? Anyway, I have nothing to hide. And you're into drawing as well? Good for you. I thought you just worked in advertising. What's wrong with advertising? Advertising is the best thing. Did you know that advertising is a science, an art and a philosophy? I majored in advertising, and I like simple and unsophisticated things... I'm a Capricorn. And I feel like listening to a song. May I request a song? [chuckles softly] I'm a Leo, and by the way, I didn't say anything about advertising. So you can advertise anything? Mmm-hmm. But it's not easy, right? You need to be really good at convincing people. Not just that. The idea of advertising is to make you like whatever I like and to make you think you really need it so that you'll go out and buy it. Thanks for the coffee. So here we are at the end of the road, and the money's gone. Now we'll go back to our boring jobs. And we'll try to fix our lives. You have my number, right? Yes, and you have mine, right? Okay, then... Bye. What did you say the name of the club was? [music playing in club] ♪ Come on, all together now Come on ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ I love her hair ♪ ♪ I love her eyes ♪ ♪ My heart is hers ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ ♪ We're coming over ♪ ♪ For her pretty eyes ♪ ♪ Just for you, my dearest love ♪ ♪ I swear to you, my dearest love ♪ ♪ I love her hair ♪ ♪ I love her eyes ♪ ♪ My heart is hers ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ What do you think, boss? Is everything as you like it? The customers are happy and more fired up than usual. What do you think about this chick? She's really hot, isn't she? ♪ I love her eyes ♪ ♪ My heart is hers ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ ♪ I love her hair ♪ ♪ I love her eyes ♪ ♪ My heart is hers ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ [MC] Let's hear it for her! [crowd clapping] [MC] The big boss, Hindi. Let's hear it for him! - Come on! The boss... - [crowd clapping] [MC] And Hindi's men, of course, we'd like to welcome you all as well... [Zeina] Shit! You scared me! Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Here's what's going to happen. I need you to relax and calm down. Okay? Because your performance was amazing, and now all the men will come in here, and they will be all over you. But don't worry, I'll handle them. I just want you to focus on Hindi. In the meantime, I'll search the place to find out where the dollar is. Okay? Tarek, I'm terrified. This is the first time I've seen people looking at me in such a vulgar way. I know. And that Hindi is so ugly, it's unbelievable! Did you see what he looks like? He doesn't have a single hair on his head! - Tarek. - Mmm. If they find out about us, are we going to die? Are they going to kill us? Huh? No, no. No. No! Don't think this way, please... Listen to me carefully. Listen to me, Zeina. Your performance today was amazing, Zuzu. - Zuzu? - [Zeina] Yes? You're fantastic. The boss really liked your show, and he's invited you to sit with him. So hurry up, let's go. Thank you. I'm glad that Mr. Hindi liked the show. Thank you. No, really, you were really great. - Kawkab? - Kawkab at your service! You'll have dinner with the guys downstairs. So go ahead. Sure. Uh... But is it okay if I stay with Zuzu, just tonight? It's her first after all. Don't give me a headache. Do as I say. I don't want anything to upset the boss. But I can't go without Kawkab. I mean... What if I needed something? What would I do? Don't worry. If you need anything from Kawkab, I'll send him over to you. So come on. Go ahead. It's okay. I'll just have dinner with the guys. It'll be fun. I just love belly dancing! I love it, and I love those who do it right. Tonight, you lit up the whole place, Zuzu. - You beautiful thing! - [in French] Thank you. [in Arabic] Tabel! Come here. Yes, boss. How much did you tell Zuzu we're going to pay her? How much are you giving her? - How much did he tell you, Zuzu? - Eight hundred bucks. - Eight hundred bucks? - Mmm. Eight hundred bucks? You were always cheap and stingy! You're such an embarrassment! You give her... double. Yes, boss. Are you happy, Zuzu? I'm thrilled! You're very generous! Honestly... I was really scared to meet you. Scared? Scared of what? I mean, they say, "Hindi has half the men in the country under his thumb." [chuckles] Yeah, and they also say that they're terrified whenever your phone number shows up on their screens. [chuckles] [laughs] You don't have to be afraid. As of tonight, you'll be Hindi's guest. Don't you worry. I love you, baby! Hello! Hello, Zuzu! [both laughing] I love eggplant. The word eggplant makes me melt. But I don't like baba ghanoush. I prefer it fried. I also like fried zucchini. I really like that. And french fries. Nothing beats french fries. I just love them. Everyone I know likes french fries. I don't know anyone who doesn't like french fries. Do you know anyone who hates french fries? No way. Everyone likes french fries. Everyone but Zuzu. Zuzu always says that she would never put a french fry in her mouth. That's why she's skinny. Although it isn't french fries that make you fat. It's carbohydrates. Strange. Strange. [laughing] - Unbelievable! - What a lovely smile! You're an angel! You're delicious! All day long, I see nothing but ugly people, and they're liars too. Liars? Whoever lies to me, I crush them, I cut them into pieces. The one thing I can never forgive is lying. You can ask me for whatever you want, but never lie to me. You're right... You're right. I'm tired, so I should go rest and get some sleep, and I'll see you tomorrow! No way. That's unacceptable. You're sitting with Hindi, and you want to go away and leave him? What for? Nothing. But like I said, I'm tired. What are you talking about? Are you a belly dancer, or are you a beginner? I don't get it. Well, in fact, yes, I am a beginner. Is that a problem? No, darling, it's not a problem at all. I want you to calm down and relax. Come with me. I'll show you my office over there, and once you sniff some coke, you'll feel refreshed, and you'll shake it all night long. [laughs] Grits, beans, lentils and all kinds of beans are an absolute no-no. I can't eat any of these things. They make me bloated. And when I'm bloated, I get a headache at the same time. Enjoy. Enjoy. Want me to tell you a secret? Don't tell anyone. I love pasta. I adore pasta. All kinds of pasta. Whenever I hear the word pasta, I forget everything and just dig in. Is there anything better than pasta? I'm not going to interrupt you guys. I'll just leave you for two minutes. I'll go take care of something and be right back. Enjoy. Enjoy. Eat as many veggies as you can. Vegetables are really good for you. Enjoy. [Zeina] What do you say I perform for you again? I feel really good and refreshed all of a sudden. Come to the office with me and sniff a couple lines, then you can dance as much as you like. Hello, Zuzu! Hello! [laughs] [Tabel] Where do you think you're going? I'm with Zuzu. I'm always with Zuzu. She's not available. She has an interview. Um... Okay, can I ask her something real quick? Go back to your table and quit bothering me. Go. Welcome, Zuzu! Welcome! You're so tempting! Tempting and sweet like honey! Have a seat, Zuzu! Hello, Zuzu! Hello! [laughs] Welcome! You're so delightful and sweet! [chuckles] Zuzu, hello! Hello, Zuzu! Hello! It's a pleasure to have you, Zuzu. [chuckles] So delightful! Sweet like honey! Come here and sniff a line. What's the matter? Come here. I'm sorry, Mr. Hindi. Forgive me, but I'm not used to things like this. Not used to them? Come here, I said! When I tell you to come here, you come here! - I will! - And you sniff! [door opens] For God's sake, Tabel! Boss, you know I'd never disturb you, even if I had a gun to my head, but Khal and his men are waiting for you downstairs. Nice. Nice, nice... Nice! Listen to me carefully. Tell all the men to be on standby around the club, and don't let any of Khal's men out of your sight. Understood? - Yes, boss. - Go! Now, gorgeous, Zuzu, you sexy kitten... You go get some rest in your room, and I won't be long. I'll be right back. ♪ You're so beautiful, you keep me busy ♪ ♪ You burn me with love ♪ You were saying you're not used to this? You'll get used to it! Oh, Zuzu! Oh! Get up, honey! Oh, Zuzu! ♪ You're so beautiful ♪ Get up! Welcome, Khal! What a pleasure to have you here. Well, it seems you've forgotten the days when you used to kiss my hand. - We're too old for hand kissing now, Khal. - Doesn't seem like it. Because what you did today is unforgivable. - What did I do? - What did you do? Do I really need to come get the delivery personally, because you wouldn't give it to my men? Are you kidding me? [chuckles] I did all this, Khal, just to have the pleasure of seeing you. And since you came all the way here, I won't let you down. Come on, guys, have a seat please. Sit down. Hey, boy! Put away this stuff and get Khal a drink. I saw it with my own eyes, but I couldn't take it. - [Tarek] Where? - In Hindi's office. I'll show you now. It seems they're busy with something really big right now. - So where is it? - Follow me. Here, in the middle drawer. He locked it and took the key with him. - [Zeina] Come on. - [Tarek] Be patient. [Zeina] Hurry! Don't move! You have no idea what you've gotten yourselves into. Hindi is going to cut you both to pieces! Well, well, well! I thought something was going on between you and this cute little fellow. Who do you work for? I swear, Mr. Hindi, we don't work for anyone. And you're liars, too? I swear... I swear I'll cut you both to pieces. I'll crush you! Tie them up! Just what I need! Actors and clowns! Mr. Hindi, let me tell you what happened. We were headed to a different room, and we came into this room by mistake. I mean, it was an accident. You came in here to steal! Do you think I'm a fool? I'm Hindi, you idiot! No, we didn't come to steal or take your drugs. We just want the dollar. The dollar? Do you think I'm that gullible? And you were pretending to be a belly dancer, Zuzu? I swear... I swear I'll make you dance on hot coals! I beg you, just don't shoot. "Don't shoot"? You think I'm going to shoot? Give me the tools! Tell the guys to load the drugs for Khal. His trucks are in the garage. - [crying] - Yes, boss. So? A finger, a foot... or an eye? [police sirens blaring] - Is this car registered to you, sir? - [Nizar] Yes, that's correct. - [officer] Why is it here? - I usually let my fiancée use it, and... And where's your fiancée? I don't know. She must be here somewhere, sitting in some... [theme music playing] Subtitle translation by Imad Naqqar
