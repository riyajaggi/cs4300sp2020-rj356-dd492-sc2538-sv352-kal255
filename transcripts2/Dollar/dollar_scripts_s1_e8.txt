 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [theme music playing] [Wajih] The opening of the bank is in two weeks, and our name has to be number one in the market. [alarm ringing] [faucet running] I want to establish a friendly relationship with the client through an advertisement idea that can be summed up in two words, that's all. Mr. Wajih? I have an idea that might save you another meeting with us. What's this?

 This is a one-dollar bill, so it could be in the hands of any person in the country. We'll release it, and it will pass from one hand to another, and go from one pocket to the next. And the owner of the bill with the right number will win a valuable prize from the bank. [Wajih] One million dollars. [butcher] Youssef! This meat order is for Professor Rafeek. Take it to his home and come back quickly. [Youssef] But, Boss, they haven't ordered anything for two weeks now. So what? They don't have to order. We just send the deliveries anyway. This is for the change. BUTCHER [symphony playing on stereo]

 [symphony stops] If I ask you, who wants this dollar now? Mmm-hmm. Great, you all want it. Okay. Now... if I do this, who wants the dollar now? Okay. What if I do... this? Who wants it? Uh-huh. In spite of everything that has happened to the dollar, you can still see its value and you're all willing to take it. Why? Because this bill, despite everything that it's gone through, has retained its value. [indistinct cries echoing] [Rafeek] What value are we talking about today? Bottom line... we place values on things so that we can go on. But they are nothing! Nothing at all! [tires screech] Weird, no movement at all since we came here. - Maybe he's sleeping. - Sleeping? Yes, sleeping. What's wrong with that? I mean, lots of people sleep during the day. The way he was talking in the lecture, there's no way he could be sleeping. I don't know. I have a feeling that there's some big mystery behind this man. He didn't finish the lecture. He left his papers and things and walked out. I don't know for sure, but I feel like he was making a show for his students to either attract their attention or intimidate them. What show and what intimidation? You want to bet he was serious? How much are we betting? Ten thousand dollars. Mmm. [scoffs] How are you going to pay me $10,000 if you don't have a penny? And do you even have a penny? You know what? Don't worry. When you lose the bet, I'll take it out of your share of the million dollars. Mmm-hmm. He's going to shoot himself. [Tarek] Let it go! Let it go, you crazy bastard. What are you doing? I'm not going to let you kill yourself. - [Zeina gasps] - Who are you? And who are you? What are you doing here? Easy! Easy. Easy. Put the gun down, please. I just saw you pointing the gun at your head, and I didn't want you to kill yourself. You still have your entire life ahead of you. Easy. You're a handsome young man. You still haven't seen anything in life. And you want to take your life away like that? - This is wrong. You can't do this! - You can't. You can't. You can't. I don't know what happened to you or what your issue is or what's bothering you, but first put the gun down, because this isn't necessary. Nothing is worth going this far. Nothing is worth it. Sit down. - Sit down. Sit down. - [stammers] Great. Sit down. He said, "Sit down." There you go. Easy, calm down. I'm Zeina Nehme. The way you've decorated your house is lovely. The colors, the plants, the atmosphere, amazing. Excellent taste. Your house is decorated in great taste. The colors are well coordinated. I... My name is Tarek Najjar, and I'm the manager of an advertising agency. We need to... Because how do people think? They think that as human beings living on this planet... [stammers] Our thoughts change, so they could take us to a place where we start going... Whatever happens... Whatever happens, you must be positive. I don't want to hear a word! I want you to listen to me. - Okay? - [both] Okay. Very good. I've been trying to kill myself for some time, and it's not working. Anyway, how much money do you want to do it? [both in French] Excuse me? To kill me! You'll take the money, and I'll have relief. No one needs to know anything. [in Arabic] Wait. Wait. What do you mean no one needs to know anything? We came to talk him out of killing himself, and he's trying to talk us into killing him? That doesn't make sense. [in Arabic] Unbelievable, sir. You're very stubborn. After everything we said to you, you still want to kill yourself? And what's worse, you want us to kill you ourselves. Let's go, Tarek. He thinks we're thieves or con artists. Let's go! I'll give you $2,000 each. Two thousand dollars? Why do you think you're worth so little? Ten thousand dollars each. Okay. I'll give you $200,000. Who do you think you are, sir? You think you can buy us with your money? It's my life, and I'm free to do whatever I want with it. Besides, I'm the only loser in this deal. What do you care? What do you mean, "What do we care"? Explain it to me. What do you mean? You'll go, and we'll be stuck with a dead body. Of course we care! I'll give you whatever written guarantees you need. - [both] No way. Never. - [clicks tongue] $200,000 for each of you. Okay. $300,000 for each of you. Good? Uh, no, no way. That's not good at all. Four hundred? $400,000 for each of you. Wait! Wait! Now you've gone too far. Are you kidding with us, or are you trying to make fun of us? - Which one is it? - What's our guarantee, sir? I mean, if this thing happens and you go up there, no one is going to go after you to ask whether you're lying or not. Also, if we did what you want us to do... Why would we do that? I'm just saying if we did what you want to us to do, we would follow you there soon enough, right? So you wouldn't be up there on your own, without us. - So... there's absolutely no way. - Mmm-hmm. Half a million for each of you. Uh... half a million dollars? Tarek, come with me, please. You want me to come with you now? Please! I said come with me. Come on, you first. This had better be good. Tarek, I don't think that you would actually... What are you saying? What are you saying? Are you crazy? I would never do it. Do I look like a murderer or a serial killer? Okay, I do love money, everyone does, but not that much! Not to the point that I would... - You must be thinking about it. - [gasps] God forbid! Are you crazy? Aside from not even being capable of doing such a thing, my morals and principles are what matter the most. Come on, apologize to me. - What? - I said apologize to me. I apologize. Come on! Let's get it over with! Is this the Oslo Accords? I can't wait all day for you to make a decision. This is the life of a human being we're talking about. So it's okay if we take the time to discuss it, even for 15 minutes. Tarek and I have decided to kill you. But let's sit down and talk for a minute. I don't want anyone telling me to sit and talk anymore! I can't stand this mother-in-law bullshit. "Let's sit and talk..." And once you start, you never finish! Hey. Hey. Take it easy. We said we're going to fucking kill you! Shit. Keep it down. The whole world just heard you saying that we're going to kill him! I just don't get it, man. What could be the reason he wants to commit suicide? We just want to have an idea. I mean, why? That's all. That way we'll sleep better. And it'll soothe our guilty consciences. Mmm-hmm? [sighs] [symphony playing on stereo] My lifelong companion, my heart's delight and soul mate... she's gone. Her voice was charming when she talked and when she sang. A voice not of this world. A voice from above, way above. My whole life was about her. With her, I knew the meaning of joy and the meaning of happiness. You know that feeling we all talk about even though we don't know it? I knew it, and I lived it. With her, everything in the world made sense. She was everything to me. And now she's gone. You know what happens when your life partner leaves you overnight, never to return? And you have no one to blame, no one to ask. - Just like that... - [snaps fingers] ...with the snap of a finger, everything is gone. As if you were watching a movie and it just ended abruptly. I agree with you. Honestly... that's not easy. But before we start this process, we need to make some arrangements. - Hmm? - Yeah, sure, sure. Mmm-hmm. - What's this? Are you going to smoke? - Hmm? Hmm? You can smoke as much as you like after he's gone. You think? Mmm-hmm. I'll take the whole box. Mmm-hmm! Don't get me wrong, but since this is your last day here, - and there... - Up there. ...they don't smoke cigars. So is it okay if I take the whole box? You're right. Okay, take it. [chuckles] Hmm. Zeina. Wow! They look great. They really suit you, Tarrou'a. They caught my eye the minute I saw them. - [Zeina] Nice. - They're very nice. They suit me, right? Wait, wait, wait, wait... Wait, wait. Is this gold? This is gold. It's gold. Huh? Take it off. Take it off. - Take it off. - Wait. It was a gift, and it's very precious to me. - Take it off. - What are you doing? Take it off. Zeina. - Look how nice it is. - It's gorgeous. - [Tarek] Right? - [gasps] Wow. Silver? No, this is not silver, it's white gold and diamonds. [Tarek] Gold? White gold? - [Rafeek] Wait. - Zeina. Take it easy. Zeina, don't say anything. It's a set. They come together. The ring, the watch, the cigars, the glasses. They look so good together. Stop it, Tarek. I really like this type of ring. - Zeina, this ring is for men. - I like men's rings! Men's rings are not for women. - Tarek. - Zeina... Stop it, both of you! Okay. Fine. It's yours. Take it. Wow. Very nice. Unbelievable. Thanks a lot, Mr. Rafeek. You're such a great person. Good? Very good. What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing. Congratulations, anyway. Congratulations. [Zeina in French] Thank you. [Tarek] But... But what? Why are you looking at me like that? I'm sure that you have more watches in here than just this one. I'm sure. And rings and diamonds. Wait, wait. Wait. Wait. I'm sure that this house has a box full of gold somewhere. I'm sure you used to buy your wife... May she rest in peace. - [in French]...emeralds. - Gold bangles. - [Zeina] Rubies! - Rubies? You're right, Zuzu. Rubies. - [in Arabic] You're calling me Zuzu? - Yes. - I love the way you say it. - [both laugh] You're unbelievable, both of you. We were talking about one thing, now we're talking about another. We had an agreement. Why are you stalling? I don't understand! Professor, what's so difficult to understand? - You're not taking anything with you. - Up there. So why do you need these things? Enough. Not a word. I understand. [inhales sharply] Ooh! Zeina. You won't believe it. This is an original painting. Sakalovsky Dmitri. Zeina, you know how much an original painting is worth? Look at this one. Look at those, upstairs. These are original paintings. Zeina, really, wow. I don't care. I want half. What do you mean you want half? You want me to tear the painting in half and give you the half that says Sakalovsky? [symphony continues playing] - [Zeina gasps] - [Tarek whistles] - Wow. - [Zeina] What's all this? Tarek, I can't believe it. These are gorgeous! [gasps] Professor, you really have good taste. Wow! Really, thank you so much, Professor. Professor, we will never forget you. Professor, we promise you that every year, Zuzu and I will come to visit and put roses on your grave. - Zuzu, will you accept my gift? - Hmm? It's a modest gift, but believe me, it's from the bottom of my heart. You have such good taste. I accept. I accept it. Look! - It's very nice. - [in French] Thank you. Really nice. You look like a princess. Okay. Professor, maybe I didn't get the chance to tell you about myself, but... I have a fine arts degree, and I have a passion for paintings and antiques. Your house is like a museum. It's full of art and things that show good taste. And considering that you will... sorry... go up there... And you're not taking anything with you up there... Get to the point. Be direct. You're exhausting me, and my heart can't take it. [Tarek] We're sorry. But I'm talking about the paintings that I'm almost sure are originals. What about them? You don't intend to compliment each other on them as well, do you? Please, let's talk about me. I want to put an end to this. - [Tarek] Professor... - [in Arabic] Dear. - Your deal is simple. One bullet... - And you'll be gone. [Tarek] We will have to do the rest. - Moving the body. - Burying it. - [Zeina] A proper burial. - Don't you agree? A proper funeral. An elegant, clean grave... [Zeina] Worthy of your social status. With the dates of your birth and your death. So we need to get all this information before... - It becomes impossible. - Mmm-hmm. What's your birth date and what's your sign? Uh... March 1st, 1957. You're a Pisces. Would you like to have something written on the grave? A poetic verse? Some wise saying for people to read... And to remember you by. I don't know. There is something, but I can't think of it right now. No problem. Here's what I'm going to do. I'll take the paintings, and you can take your time to think. - Zuzu, honey, help me out. - Mmm. Okay. You take down this side, and I'll take down that side. Wait. Who said you could do that? [both] You have nothing to lose. I can't wait to die and get rid of you two. [sighs] So? Okay. Great. What do you mean, "Great"? What about me? - You're going to get half. - So we're splitting it? - Of course. - Shall I say how nice it looks? - Say it for both of us. - Wow, how nice. How nice. Tarrou'a? [Tarek] Yes, Zuzu. [Zeina] Didn't you say earlier that the house was like a small museum, and that all the furniture is antique? [Tarek] That's correct. What? What else do you want? [sighs] I want the whole kitchen and the hallway furniture. If you want, you can have the rest of the furniture. [Tarek] Really? You want to have the kitchen and the hallway furniture? You're so greedy. Look, if you touch my kitchen, I'll break your hand. Your kitchen? So it's your kitchen now? Zeina! "Zeina"? Before, you were calling me Zuzu! Now you're calling me Zeina! Shame on you. Shame on you. Are you serious? Lower your voice. At least out of respect for the deceased, who can still hear us. If you don't want to respect him, at least respect the occasion. Professor, forgive us. We may have raised our voices a little, but don't worry. We'll take the furniture and split it up later. - Tarrou'a? Um... - Yes, honey. Will you sell me the desk? I'll give you a few things from the kitchen. A few things from the kitchen? Like what? Lots of things. You can choose whatever you want. There are cooking pans, glasses, dishes... Ha-ha! Cooking pans and dishes for this desk? You're dreaming. Forget about the desk. Besides, come here. Are you forgetting that you lost the bet? You owe me $10,000, loser. Shame on you. Shame on you. You think a stupid desk is too much for me, knowing that I'm about to kill a person with my own hands! [Tarek] But I'm going to kill the person with you. We're both killing him together! Stop it, both of you! Where did you come from? The loony bin? You're insane! That's my furniture you're talking about. It's my house. And you're dividing it up in my presence? - You're not... - I know. Don't say it. I know! I'm not taking the damn furniture with me because I'm going to die. - Because... - Because up there, there's no furniture. But right now, this is my furniture and my house. Besides, you can't say these things in front of me. It's rude! I'm still among the living. Are you kidding me? This is my house! Uh-huh. Speaking of your house... when you die, who's going to inherit it? Who's going to inherit this house? That's the question. When you're gone, do you have an heir who gets the house? God, give me patience. No, there's no one. I have no one in the whole world. Is that good? No, it's not good. Why don't you? That's another question. When you're gone, the State is going to take away the house. [slurps] Not just that. And they'll take away the furniture and sell it at auction. [in English] No way! [in Arabic] Are you serious, Tarek? Are you really going to let this happen? Are you kidding? Are we going to sit there and watch while some stranger comes and takes everything? Of course not! You're unbelievable! Let's get it over with! My heart hurts from having to put up with you! Okay, can you tell me now how we are going to start and finish this thing? It's very easy. With the gun. But this process needs some arrangements and preparations. Why are we wasting time, then? Let's start with the preparations! Well, yes. But we're just trying to ensure we get our share. What share? You've tortured me enough with this. You took everything. What else do you want from me? You're wearing me down! Professor, please calm down. It's not that simple. We want to do it right. We need to take our time. Besides, we want to know what's ours and what's yours. - [shushing] - [footsteps on recording] Huh? One second. [door hinges creaking] - [door slams] - [recording stops] I've always been very passionate about music. It was a Thursday, I was listening to The People's Voice radio station. They used to play rare pieces. I had heard Brahms' entire Second Symphony was going to be played that night, so I decided to record it from the radio. I closed all the doors, created a quiet atmosphere and started recording it. And right in the middle of the piece, Carmen came home and started coming and going and making noises. I got upset, and I had a fight with her because she ruined the recording. But now, all I have left of Carmen... is that little fight where you can hear Carmen's voice. I began listening to it every day, and it has become much more pleasant to me than Brahms and all the symphonies of the world. Those few words that Carmen utters are the most precious thing to me. [symphony playing] [Rafeek shushes on recording] Not a sound! [Carmen] What? What's the matter? I'm sorry. You're recording? [Rafeek] Too late. You ruined the whole recording. [Carmen laughs] Come on, Rafeek. Why are you making such a big deal out of it? Is Brahms going to be upset about it? Do you care so much about the feelings of some German guy? [Rafeek] It's okay. Just go now. Go. Go and let me finish recording. And stop slamming the doors. [Carmen] You look so cute when you're angry. [recording stops] Wow! I'm really into vintage things. I really like it. [gasps] I love this recorder. I'm going to take it. No, you're not taking it all for yourself. Come on, Tarek. What's the matter? Are we going to start again? You're unbelievable. Whenever I like something, you want to take it? Fine, fine. You take the tapes, and I'll take the recorder. No! Stop right there. Don't you touch this. Don't either of you touch it. What are you doing? - But you... - Come on, Professor... Shut up! Don't you want to commit suicide? Not anymore! Are you happy now? I don't want to commit suicide anymore! I want to live and burn this money. Just stay away from me. Damn you! You're like Dracula. You sucked all my blood and made me feel sorry for myself while I'm still alive! Are you sure you don't want to commit suicide? Is this your final decision? I'm as certain as looking at you now. I'm also certain that if you stay in this house for another second, I'll be willing to commit murder. And if I do, I will have no remorse whatsoever. Got it? Out. Get out. Before I start emptying this gun into you. Go! Very well. Now you see, Professor, everything you said in today's lecture, you didn't mean any of it? And that you will always find value in something, no matter how small? Even if it's just a recording of Brahms' Second Symphony. Professor, we were at the lecture today. If you think that nothing in life has any value, perhaps you are valuable to someone. We were never going to kill you in the first place. We're not criminals, and we're not thieves. But believe me, it was very hard for us to see a professor with all your greatness and knowledge trying to end his own life in this tragic way and do nothing about it, even if we had to lie. Ever since Carmen died... this house has been cold and lifeless. Ever since that day, not even two words were uttered in it. It was just me and this picture. Today, when you came here, there was life in the house. And that's a good thing. Professor, you're a wonderful person, and you're generous. You have to go back to your students, who were surprised by what you said today. Professor, didn't you ask yourself why we're here today? We're here for the one-dollar bill that you had when you were giving the lecture. That bill is really important to us. That bill holds a very special and precious memory in our hearts. So it's like the affinity you have for the Brahms' symphony. The one-dollar bill? Ah, yes. It's gone. I think it's gone. [both] Where did it go? Every couple of days, the dry cleaner comes and picks up my laundry, so... No way. We were outside the whole time. He comes in through the front door of the building.
