 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [theme music playing] [Wajih] The opening of the bank is in two weeks, and our name has to be number one in the market. [alarm ringing] [faucet running] I want to establish a friendly relationship with the client through an advertising idea that can be summed up in two words, that's all. Mr. Wajih? I have an idea that might save you another meeting with us. What's this?

 This is a one-dollar bill, so it could be in the hands of any person in the country. We'll release it, and it will pass from one hand to another and go from one pocket to the next. And the owner of the bill with the right number wins a valuable prize from the bank. [Wajih] One million dollars. [man 1] It's all there, Abu Hatem. [song playing on radio] Hello. Hello, sir. [softly] Speak louder. Hello, sir! [in normal voice] Louder!

 Hello, sir! [softly] Tarek, what if he's dead? [song continues playing] I'm not deaf! I heard you the first time. So, how can I help you? They could hear me shouting all over Beirut. The guys who were filming the TV series took some props from your shop. [shouting] They brought you a safe... [banging on can] - ...made of iron. - Stop shouting! I said I'm not deaf! Look, man... Downstairs, there's a storage room, and it's full. You'll find, like, 20 or 30 safes. Go there and choose the one you like. But we're looking for a specific safe! Why are you shouting? The guy said he isn't deaf. [in normal voice] Sir, there's a safe that has no key. If it closes, it can't be reopened. Where is it? What is this? A riddle? Ah! [laughing] The safe that, once closed, can't be reopened. - That's right. - [Abu laughs] [Zeina chuckles] Well, I've always wanted to get rid of that one, so I sold it. I sold it. I sent it to an auction. - An auction? - What auction? So if we don't find it here, it could've been sold? Where's the auction? Where's the auction? Is it in Beirut? Where is it? In Beirut? Is the auction in Beirut? Is it in Beirut? Beirut? [auctioneer] Welcome to Abu Al Ward's Gallery. Allow me to introduce a piece that's very dear to my heart, and let's begin the auction with it. A window box from France. With roses made from Sèvres porcelain and wood. Welcome again. And now we'll start the bidding with $500! Does anyone want to go higher? $500! - [man 1] $550! - [auctioneer] We have $550! - [man 2] $600! - [auctioneer] $600! - $600! Who will go higher? - The first item is the window box, - and the safe is next. - [auctioneer] $650! [man 3] $700. - So it hasn't come out yet. - [auctioneer] $700! - $900! $950! - But I can't find it. In a minute, they'll take down the window box and display the safe. - Hopefully. Please, God. - [auctioneer] $1,000! One, two... Sold! Congratulations, sir. Next piece, guys. And hurry up, please. Welcome, welcome. Welcome. An office safe. An office safe made of iron, copper, hard steel. It contains two shelves and a small inner compartment, and it comes with two keys. - We'll start off the bid at only $200. - Where's the safe? [auctioneer] $200 dollars. Who'll go higher? Tarek, it's not the same one. - Do you think it sold? - A safe made of iron and copper, $200. - [man 4] $300. - [auctioneer] $300! We were looking at page two, and all items on page one have already been sold. There it is. Look. "An iron safe with no key." [auctioneer] $450! Sold! Congratulations, sir! [boy] 10,000 pounds! 10,000! 10,000! 10,000! [indistinct chatter] [auctioneer] Hey, take it easy. What you're doing is inappropriate. Are you kidding? Here's a spicy fajita and some french fries and yogurt. Just tell me, where's the safe? Sir, please, I told you a million times already, once something is sold, I don't know where it goes! Wherever the person who bought it goes, it goes with them! If you were in our shoes, where would you look for it? Speak up. Answer me. I just need to know... who's dumber? The person who buys a safe with no keys or those who search for it? You know what? Leave now, and you might catch him. He's probably still trying to fit it into some car. [coughs] - What's the matter, Tarek? - [sighs] As if nothing happened, yeah? As if you didn't just lose the dollar. You almost look as if you're going to start comforting me. What a person feels doesn't necessarily show on their face. Honestly, I was saying to myself on the way here that it's good we played this little game. It turned our lives upside down, and we got to know each other better. You know you're a really good person, right? Son of a bitch! What? Who's the son of a bitch? You see what that bastard did? He threw my things out in the street. It's like he's just been waiting for the opportunity. Damn you, Nizar. He couldn't wait one day for me to come back. Look what he did. Look how he left the plant. It's all dried out. [crying] - The apartment is his, right? - It's his father's. You think that loser owns anything? Everything belongs to his father, who controls him and his brothers. Every month, he picks up his allowance like a spoiled brat, but when it comes to me, he acts all macho. Listen, I'm really hungry. How about we take this stuff now, and figure out something later? Okay. [Tarek] So he decided to divorce her and marry another woman. Not just that, he also wanted to kick her out of the house. [Zeina] Jerk. [Tarek] She was really upset. I mean, she was devastated. She said to him, "At least, let me stay in the house because I'm attached to it and used to it." He wouldn't. [Zeina] Because he's a mean jerk. But guess what she did before leaving the house? What did she do? She convinced him to let her invite him to dinner to celebrate the divorce. She made fish and crabs. When they finished dinner, without him noticing, she took the leftovers and put them inside the curtain rods, and she hung them back up. That mean jerk deserved it. Mmm. The other woman moved into the house. When she moved in, they started smelling this stench inside the house, and they couldn't tell where it was coming from. They cleaned the house several times, but the stench was still there. They painted the walls. The stench was still there. They changed the furniture, but the stench was still there. They almost went crazy trying to find the source, but they couldn't. So they finally gave up, and they came to a decision. They put up the house for sale. Potential buyers would come to see the house, and they wanted to buy it, but they could smell this horrible stench. So they would run away. Finally, she came and said to them, "I'll do you a favor. Since you're unable to sell the house, I'll buy it, but for 25% of its price." - They accepted her offer. - She's smart. She bought the house and stayed in it. But I don't understand. You want me to invite Nizar for some crabs? You saw what happened. Me, my stuff and the crabs are out on the street. You know what, Tarek? If I had a million dollars, I'd buy a nuclear missile. I said "nuclear." Listen carefully. Then I'd go to Nizar's place and aim the missile at the living room. I'd blow him up in his own living room, and I'd just watch. Wow! Nuclear? You want to kill us all along with Nizar? Besides, you don't have a million dollars to buy the missile, because half of it is mine. This one million dollars is in my head, so it's part of my dreams. You want to share my dreams, as well? You're unbelievable. You know what? Let's go to my place. You'll bring in your things, you'll rest a little, and you'll be able to think clearly until you find a solution. I'm tired of sitting on the street like a homeless person. What do you mean by "homeless"? I mean, are you enjoying it out here? Why are you being stubborn? I don't understand. Besides, you're the one with the problem, not me. So that I can never forget that you did me a favor, right? Why don't you do me a favor and let us go home? Let me finish my meal, at least. I'll put your things here, and you can unpack them wherever you want. What's the matter? I don't know. It's a big hassle and... You know what? It's best if I go to a hotel. [tisks] You don't have to take care of me. You have your own life, your own place... I don't want to be an added burden. The idea of me staying here was a very stupid idea in the first place. Stupid? And what would be a smarter idea? Roaming around the streets with your bags? Please, stop this nonsense, Zeina. If I didn't think you should stay here, I wouldn't have asked you to. Or did you think I did that out of pride? But you don't have to. If it's about the dollar, well, the dollar is gone. So the only thing keeping us together is gone. Now we can put an end to this alliance and move on. Alliance? I don't know who you think I am, but I thought we had a friendship, not just the dollar. And friendship is more precious than anything else. Friendship? - And coffee. - "And coffee." That's a good girl! You only have to say "abracadabra," and the coffee will be there. Also, don't stand around like you're here to buy the house. Hang on, you didn't tell me... Where am I going to unpack? [Tarek] Wherever you want. I mean, where am I going to sleep? On the bed. [Zeina] Mmm-hmm. What about you? Where are you going to sleep? I'll manage as long as you're comfortable. Here we go. Go ahead and start nagging. Pretend to be the victim, while I'm the mean bitch who stole your bed and put you out on the living room couch. I'll sleep on my comfy bed, and you sleep here and unpack wherever you want. How about that? Just like that? Such heroic generosity. You couldn't wait for me to slip so that you could vent your anger. Another thing. Where's the bathroom? Over there. Does that mean if you were sleeping here at night and you wanted to go to the kitchen or the bathroom, you'd see me sleeping over here? Absolutely. Absolutely not! [in English] No way! [in Arabic] I'll sleep here on the bed, and you'll sleep here on the couch. It's all the same. If you sleep there and I sleep here, and you wanted to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, you'd have to go through here, and you'd see me sleeping. You know what? The room with the comfy bed is this way, so go this way, please. You can put my things off to the side. There's not much. What about this oak tree you brought? Are we going to leave it by the door? [Zeina] I'll move it here, to my room. I love it so much. I can't live without it. I want to put it somewhere here by the window, so that it can get some light. [screams] What's wrong? What's this? This is my friend Mansour. He was a martyr, so I kept his skull. Are you joking? Are you? Can't you see it's made of plastic? Did you really believe it was Mansour? I used it in a commercial once and then I held on to it. [in low voice] Zeina. Zeina. Zeina. [in normal voice] Coward. I'll leave it here. Is that okay? So this scares you, but the pictures on the mirror don't? - I'll take them down now. - [in French] Excuse me? IMMORTALITY [insects chirping] Are you scared of something? Don't be a jerk. I couldn't sleep. [sighs] Why? Isn't the bed comfortable enough? The bed is very comfortable. [sighs] I can't sleep because I'm thinking too much. Zeina, the dollar is gone. Maybe you should go back to your job and your life and forget everything that's happened. I'm not thinking about the dollar... or chasing money. Because after all that we've been through, all that running around, what have we gained? Hmm? Nothing but trouble and humiliation. What are you talking about? Personally, I've gained a lot from this experience. It was like a quick, strong slap, and it was necessary. A slap? And what a slap, man. What a slap. I feel sorry for myself. After all that running around, I lost my job... [inhales deeply] my fiancé turned out to be a jerk, and we broke up. He forgot everything we had together, just like that. He threw my things out in the street, and he left. [sobbing softly] And with him went the apartment that used to be my shelter. And now I find myself here, and I don't know what to do. I don't even have a pillow to rest my head on. I feel so sorry for myself. So you're telling me there isn't a single pillow in the bedroom? [Zeina chuckles] [sniffles] Listen. This is all in the past now. Maybe because of it, you've learned that you can't be with someone like him. Maybe you should be happy about this. Do you want a drink? I went through a rough patch myself, maybe even more than you. But I'm not going to be upset and I'm not going to worry, because I take it one day at a time. I never worry about the past, and I never regret it. Were you in love with him? I don't know. I can't say that I was in love with him. I'm not usually driven by my feelings and emotions. I plan my life step by step. - Maybe Nizar was something I had to do. - That means you're not in love with him. If you were, you would've been able to answer immediately. If I was, I never would've left him, not even for a million dollars. Remember Professor Rafeek from the university? Yes, that man was amazing. That's a man who's capable of love and deserves to be loved. Can you believe I envied his wife that day for this great love he feels for her? That was the moment I realized it was time for me to leave Nizar. I had a feeling there was nothing left between us. Because everything we had together was wrong from day one. [breathes heavily] Good night. [sniffles] By the way, I found this book under the pillow. Is it okay if I read it? Yes. That's a very good book. It's about the gestures we use as human beings. Gestures? As human beings, we have so many feelings, but not enough gestures. So you can use the same gesture for different feelings. For instance, you can say to someone, "I love you," and with the same gesture, you can say, "I don't want you." Mmm. So... Good night. This is also a gesture. [beeping] Zeina, don't take too long. Breakfast will get cold. [Zeina] Is hot water to the right or to the left? Left. [doorbell rings] Gihan? What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing's wrong. Does it seem like something's wrong? It's only a breakup after all. No biggie, right? Since the day you left, I can't... I can't breathe. I can't believe that you just walked out the door, just like that. I can't live. I can't control myself. I can't enjoy anything. That's okay. It's just a phase. It'll pass. It's not. You don't get it, Tarek. It's not passing. I did everything I could to get over you. There's nothing I haven't tried. It's hopeless! It's just hopeless! I traveled all over the world. I went camping and shopping. I've been to outings, parties. I even went tuna fishing! And I couldn't get over you. Baby... Don't start. Whenever you say that word, there's always trouble behind it. Don't call me "baby." Tarek, why don't we just format everything we went through? Let's erase it, forget it. Delete it as if it never happened. We look ahead, we travel, and we live our life. We go back to loving each other, and we leave the past behind. "Format"? You must have been watching a lot of movies, because you seem to have strong emotions that you don't know how to express. That's mean. I know you're mad at me. Okay, I can have a temper sometimes, and I can be... Controlling and selfish. You're right. You're right. You're right, Tarek. - But let's just make a fresh start. - I can't. Tarek, I'll help you. I'll be there for you. - Let's go back to my villa. - See? Your villa. In a couple of days, you'll be back to your old ways. "Tarek, I'm financially supporting you. You live in my house." Look, Gihan. All your money and all your cars... Are worth nothing to you. I know. You won't hear me talking about those things again. Forget about it. Tarek, forget all this history. I promise, baby, you'll never hear me say those things again. What do you say? I mean, do you like this life you're living? Do you like this shabby apartment? Do you consider this a home? Where do you eat? Look at this! I mean, where do you sleep? Where do you seat your guests? How could the man I love, me, Gihan, my husband, how could he live in this dump? "Dump"? This dump is my home, and I like it. And I'm really happy with my life now, because I can't stand your etiquette and I don't give a damn about what people say. A girlfriend... Are you stuck on some chick? You want to get married, don't you? This is my life. It's none of your business. And even if I had someone, you think I'd tell you? Tarek, listen to me. I'll buy you the biggest advertising agency, along with its staff. Even that cheap little agency you work for. If you're so attached to it, I'll buy it. I'll buy it for you, along with its staff. We'll expand it, make it better, until it becomes... Until it becomes what? Worthy of your family? Isn't that what you were going to say? Gihan? Juju. Call me Juju. I love when you say it. Listen to me carefully. I have nothing left to offer you. I have my life, and you have yours. If it really hurts now, you'll get used to it and move on eventually. Tarek, you listen to me. You listen to me very carefully. I'm not going anywhere without you. I'm not budging. [in French] Hello. [in Arabic] I'm Zeina. [indistinct chatter on TV] And I'm about to have a stroke. I can't believe my eyes. I can't believe what I'm seeing. Right now, I could fuck up both your life and hers. I could burn you both. I could set the whole world on fire. I could turn this place into dust! Are you cheating on me, you asshole? - Are you cheating on me with her? - [in French] Excuse me? Asshole! Piece of shit! [in Arabic] Enough with the bullshit. Stop accusing me of cheating. We're separated. I bet you already had an arrangement with her. I bet you planned it all out together the whole time. You piece of shit. You're cheating on me? That's it, now I'm going to haunt you. From now on, you have to know that I'm going to haunt you. This whole life you've made for yourself, I'll take it all away. I'll make you regret ever being with this slut. You're cheating on me? I swear I'll have you roaming the streets, talking to yourself. I swear I'll make you kill yourself in the nuthouse! And you, what do you even see in him? He doesn't even have a cent! And I'm sure he's cheating on you, too. It's none of your business! Besides, why are you cursing and threatening us like that? Tarrou'a, do you want her here? I'm sure you don't. So... get the hell out! Out! Come on! Out! Out! Let go of me! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! And you, out of the way. Don't forget to haunt me along with Tarek, okay? I'm very hungry. Let's have breakfast. I... That was Gihan. She... I heard everything. I'm really sorry. But, you know, she's a bit crazy. She's very foolish. You're the foolish one. How could you marry someone like her? I couldn't put up with her. That's why we broke up. And that's how she's been ever since. Whenever she reads a story or watches a movie, she comes to annoy me. [Zeina sighs] Anyway, I want to thank you for breakfast and this lovely presentation. Enjoy. But you're very intimidating. That's the first time Gihan's been kicked out of here like a stray cat. Serves her right. I hope she never comes back. Enough about her. What do you say we have breakfast? Sure. You're right. Zuz, this salad is my very own recipe. - I make it specifically for breakfast. - Mmm-hmm. [TV news anchor] Now we've reached the Funny Stories segment of our news broadcast - with our co-host Reem. - [Zeina] Can I try it? [Reem] A video has gone viral on social media - over the past two days. - [Zeina] But it looks spicy. [Reem] A young man who bought a closed iron safe - that had no keys... - [Zeina] Is this also your recipe? [Tarek] No, it's my mother's. [Reem] ...hoped to find money inside of it. [Tarek] I'll introduce you to my parents one day. You'll really like them. [Reem] He opened the safe, and the only thing he found was one dollar. - [Zeina] It's very spicy. - [man 1 laughing on TV] [Zeina] Very spicy. [man 1 continues laughing] What's this? One dollar? - [Tarek] I didn't make it very spicy. - [man 1] One dollar? [Zeina] Water! It is spicy! I need water! [Tarek] Here, drink some tea. - [utensils clattering] - [man 1 laughing] [Zeina] It's very spicy. - [Tarek] Well, it's okay, never mind. - [man 2] Shut up.
