 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES The opening of the bank is in two weeks, and our name has to be number one in the market. I want to establish a friendly relationship with the client. I want an advertising idea that can be summed up in two words, that's all. Mr. Wajih? I have an idea that might save you another meeting with us. What's this? This a one-dollar bill, so it could be in the hands of any person in the country. We'll release it to the public, and it will pass from one hand to another and go from one pocket to the next.

 And the owner of the bill with the right number wins a valuable prize from the bank. One million dollars. It's you? Morning. What are you doing here? I came to see if you have running water. I'll make you some coffee. Seems you slept well. My face is swollen, right? Not at all. On the contrary, it looks good. And fresh. Anyway, tell me, what did you do? Nothing. I'm waiting for Dima's phone call.

 You're waiting for Dima's phone call? What if she forgets and doesn't call? What then? Do you really think she could forget to do something I asked? If you can't appreciate the man sitting in front of you, there are others who are willing to die for him. Well, that's a relief. You call her right now, and you tell her to find him wherever he is, or else I'll tear the three of you to pieces. Your place is nice. If you are this well off, why get involved in this mess? We made a mistake. It's my fault. It's my fault. We didn't need to go through all this. I saw that dollar with my own eyes. It was right in front of me. I should've pulled it out of her purse, whether she liked it or not. Do you live alone? I won't even ask you why you haven't been answering my calls. Or where you have disappeared to for the past two days without a word. Okay, so what do you want? What do I want? I want to know where we stand. I want to put an end to what you've been doing to me. Okay, very well. But please make it quick. You can't stand me this much, Zeina? What's wrong with you? Nizar, please don't get me wrong. I don't know what's wrong with me. I mean, I'm stressed and I have a lot on my mind. Can we talk about this later? Are you seeing someone else? Am I seeing someone else? Shame on you! Shame on you! If I was seeing someone, I wouldn't give a damn about you or anyone else! You know what? - This thing... - Sweetheart, please! Please! Calm down! Calm down, please! I'm sorry. I apologize. I was wrong. But what I'm going through isn't easy, either. I wish you could make some time for me. And when you get the chance, I want to hear your final answer regarding us. I love you. Are you serious? Really, are you serious? I swear to God, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, from the bottom of my heart. Don't tell me you're sorry. No one puts me in this situation. I mean, fuck! It felt like I was your lover! It's your fault. You came here unexpectedly. You're right. And you will never see my face again. - Who is it? - None of your business. It's Dima, isn't it? No, it's a friend of mine. Don't worry. Don't worry. If she calls me, I'll send you the guy's number and you can go from there on your own. I'm tired of having to go through all this shit with a crazy, stupid woman like you. Shoes? Sir? Is this seat taken? No, go ahead. - We're Ronnie's parents. - Excuse me? We're Ronnie's parents. What grade is your kid in? My kid... KG 2. So he's older than Ronnie. What's his name? Abdul Wadud. Bless him. Are you his mother? Yes, I'm Boudy's mother. My precious baby. You'll meet him when the party's over. Are you following me? I don't have to. I called Dima and she told me everything. Why didn't you tell me that you were coming? Really? Didn't you say that you don't want to look for the dollar anymore? Or have you forgotten that you told me to go ahead on my own? This is not the time to nag. Once Rafi comes out, you keep an eye on every move he makes, because he's really sharp. What are you going to do now? Are we just going to sit and watch? Don't start bothering me. This requires focus and patience. Can't you see he's like a genie? How are you going to take the dollar from him? That's if he even still has it. Do you have a better idea? Do we have an idea at all? We're wasting our time for nothing. Do whatever you want. I'm staying here until I get the dollar from him. And now... we're going to play a fun game. And the winner gets to blow out the candles with Sam. Does anyone have a dollar? A dollar? Thank you, sweetie. Can everyone see the dollar? Some people spend their whole life chasing it, striving to find it, not knowing where to hide it. And some people, they don't care! They treat it like dirt, and they throw it away. And this dollar that you see... turns into a rose! And now, whoever catches the rose gets to blow out the candles with Sam. What are you doing? Do you want me to keep the door open? No, close it, but stay outside. Who do you think you are? Don't think you're getting the dollar for yourself. I didn't say that. What, then? Explain to me why you're here without telling me. Besides, how did you get here so fast? I was following the guy so closely. There's no time to argue. Help me look for the dollar, and we can talk later. Let's hurry and get out of here. But you promised me. Or have you changed your mind? Sweetheart... Naya, dear. We don't get this lucky everyday. Look how they love us. But you promised that we'd go buy it together. And I'm keeping my promise. If you want, let's just pack up and go buy it right now. No, it's okay. Let's do it another day. Bed and butter comes first. It's "bread and butter." Isn't that what you used to say to Mom? May she rest in peace. - Aren't you hungry? - Yes! I'll buy you a delicious bagel. What do you say? Let's go. Come on. Are you happy now? The dollar is gone. Maybe he still has it. You never know. What if he doesn't? Can't you see what he bought? Yeah, but what can we do about it? Do you want us to take it by force? Why not? Are you serious? Do you want me to grab the man by the throat and say, "Cough up the dollar"? "Cough up the one million dollars." As long as you're chasing a paper bill, you'll never find the one million. Are you mad? No, I'm not. But I don't see things in a bad way like you do. Besides, if you're just going to mock every word I say, we'll never get to the dollar. Come on. It's okay. Don't get me wrong. You know how difficult life is these days, and an amount like that could change both our lives. Yes, but too many cooks spoil the broth. One of us has to do the planning, and then we carry it out together. Okay, I'll do as you say. Now, if you have a better idea, we can certainly go with it. But I'm saying this because I've seen a lot. And I can figure out the best way to get what we want without any trouble. Like what? Miss, come please. Open your right hand. Now cover it with your left hand. Return to your place. Does anyone have a dollar? One dollar? Do you have one? Thank you. Can everyone see the dollar? Some people spend their whole life chasing it, striving to find it, not knowing where to hide it. And some people don't care. They treat it like dirt and throw it away. When money is in the hands of miserable people, it turns into misery. And in the hands of happy people, it turns into happiness. And the dollar turns into... a rose! Bravo! Excuse me? Can you do the opposite? Excuse me? The opposite. What about this one? This one? This one? This one? The show is over! What's the matter? What happened? I said the show is over. It's over. Why are you upset? Did we offend you somehow? Why am I upset? Well, I don't know. Why don't you ask yourselves? I was performing with my daughter, and there was a big happy crowd. Then you two showed up and ruined the show! But we were playing along. Playing along? Did you come to sell me roses for a dollar each? Are you trying to do business at my expense? No, bro, I didn't mean to. But the thing is... Stop, stop! Don't say anything. Please, just leave me alone. Will you calm down so we can talk about it? Talk about it? What's there to talk about? Who sent you for God's sake? What do you want from me? Bro, we want nothing from you. It's just that... It's nothing at all! Just take this young lady and get out of here. This isn't your house! I'll leave, then. Wait! Wait, Mr. Rafi. Wait. We came to ask you for one thing. That's all. - Ask me? - Yes. Go ahead, ask. But make it quick, please. Okay. Last night, you performed at Mrs. Lilianne's party. Yeah! I thought I saw you two before! I saw you at Mrs. Lilianne's party! Very good. Then you remember the dollar that you turned into a rose? Sure. Well, give it to us, please. No way. What do you mean, "No way"? It's ours. Well, that was a magic trick. It's not like I stole it. No, we didn't say that you did. - What do you want then? - Give it back to us. You both must be crazy! I gave you more than one dollar just now! Mr. Rafi! Mr. Rafi, please. This dollar holds a very precious memory to Tarek and me. Because ever since we got engaged, Tarek and I... we consider it as a souvenir, or you could say a... good-luck charm. Okay, but what does this have to do with me? What do you mean, what does it have to do with you? The dollar is with you! It's not! You saw how it turned into a rose! Don't tell me it turned into a rose and all this magician crap! Cough up the dollar before I smash your teeth! Dad! Dad! They took the van! They took the van! Officer! Officer! Officer! Here. Try to calm down. They've taken my car so many times. It's nothing. Nothing? You have no clue! You just go to the impounding lot and get it back. The van isn't registered. What do you mean? It's not yours? It is. But I bought it as damaged goods. It's a van with no registration papers. This van is where I live with my little girl. What? How come? Where's your home? My home? What home? I go somewhere different every day. One day I go north, the next I go south. Yesterday, I was in Batroun. Today, I'm here, performing on the sidewalk. Tomorrow, I don't know where I'll be. And I couldn't leave this girl on her own. Eventually, she started helping me. Why don't you just stick to parties? Wouldn't it be better than this unstable life? Parties aren't always available. This is why I try to make a little money here and there. And that van is a prop, and it's our wardrobe. At night, I get in it, and I go to sleep with my girl in my arms, dreaming that tomorrow might be better. It's okay, sweetheart. Stop crying. I wish I could die! I wish I could die! What are you saying, man? Don't talk like that in front of your little girl. I'm saying it in front of her on purpose, because I'm ashamed. I can do magic tricks for everybody, but I cannot do magic for my own daughter. I wish... I wish I could wave my magic wand, and give her a house where she can live safely. I wish. I wish... I wish I could raise this hat like this and have money falling out of it, so that I could buy her clothes and send her to school like all her friends... I wish... I wish I could do one magic trick and make just one of her dreams come true. All the kids come to watch me, to have fun, to feel joy, to laugh. And my own precious little girl, I can't make her laugh, I can't bring her joy, I can't put a smile on her face. What's your name, honey? Naya. Naya, you're old enough now. And you have to support your dad and help him out. Today, we're here to help you out and to try to solve your problem. They will steal it. Honey, no one will steal your van. It's yours. The piggy bank, they will steal it. The piggy bank? The pink house that has money in it. She was saving money in it, one dollar at a time. Which dollar? I mean... What? For the bicycle. I had a deal with Naya that for every rose, I'd give her one dollar that she can put in her piggy bank. Today, we were supposed to break the piggy bank and buy the bicycle. IMPOUNDING LOT ABOU AMEEN It was right in front of me. It was right under my nose, and I didn't even see it, because you had to come in and scare me! Cut it out, please! Stop it! We both searched the van and didn't realize it was in the piggy bank. Because I was nervous! You made me nervous! - Cut it out! - You made me nervous! Did you call your friend? Yes, she called someone who works with the police, and they said they'd call the impounding lot and try to get the van released if no ticket has been written. Are you Zeina? Yes, I'm Zeina. How did it go? Come with me to the office, please. You can drive the van out while I finish up with the lady. - Excellent. - Where are you going? What do you mean? Didn't you hear what he said? I'll sign the release papers, and we'll leave together. - And why is that? - You know why. God, give me patience! Come on, you two! - Come on. - You first. - What do you want? - Are you going to stop being childish? Do you think I'm an idiot? You want to take the van and go? God! Where would I go? We're taking the van back to Rafi. And why would I need this van anyway? You need what's inside it. What? Are you doubting me? Honey, if you were in my shoes, you'd have done the same. Of course not! I would have come up with another option. Enough with your options and your analyzing, because look where it's gotten us. And if they hadn't impounded the van, we would've been done by now! Tarek, what do you want? And make it short! Go sign the papers with the dude. I'll drive the van out and wait for you. No. I'll sign the paper, and we'll leave together in the van. There you go. And once you're done, you drive the van, and I'll wait for you outside. Let's go, ma'am! Hey! Slow down! I'm going to throw up because of your driving! Can't you wait until we pull over somewhere quiet and search together? Let's buy some time! Anyway, I see you. I'm watching you like a hawk. Keep your eyes on the road, or you're going to run into something! This one is the last one. So? - So? - None of them. What do you mean? Check again. Hey! I said it's none of them. Do you think I'm trying to cheat you? This means that Rafi's the one who fooled us. Why would he fool us? He didn't say where the dollar was. Anyway, all his money is small change, just like that dollar! That's it, then. The dollar is gone. What are we going to do now? We'll give him back his van and go our separate ways. What about Naya? Who's Naya? What about her? I don't know. She just makes my heart ache. What did she do to deserve to suffer because of all this? Dad! Dad! It's the van! It's the van! The van is back! It's back so soon! I can't believe my eyes! Naya! The van is back! The van is back! Where? Where did God send you from? Come on, Rafi, people are there for each other. Now we can say... Abracadabra. Come on. Congratulations! - Oh, sweetheart... - Dad! Dad! Look how nice it is! Do you see, Mr. Tarek? You came to me today to learn about my magic, but it turns out you're the real magician, helping me out of my dilemma. Don't mention it. Anyway, this is Miss Naya's money. - What? - It's Naya's money. But... I don't know. Why? This money is hers. Honestly, the piggy bank was broken on our way back. So we thought we'd keep the money with us until we gave it back to you, because we didn't want you to think we were thieves. God forbid. We have a lot to thank you for. Besides, this is for the bicycle that you got for my daughter. No way! What are you saying? Zeina and I got this bicycle together as a gift to Naya. We accept your gift, but this money is not mine, it's Naya's. Naya! Naya, come here for a sec. Thanks a lot. Listen, Naya, sweetheart. Here... here's the $100 that you had saved for the bicycle. Dad, it's 99. - What? - It's 99, not 100. The dollar you gave me yesterday, I couldn't save it. When did your dad give you that dollar? Last night, after we left the party. You mean the dollar that we... Sweetheart, what did you do with that dollar? I kissed it, and before I put it in the piggy bank, Samir whistled to me. He wanted some money to buy a sandwich. Who's Samir? Subtitle translation by Imad Naqqar
