 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [theme music playing] [Wajih] The opening of the bank is in two weeks, and our name has to be number one in the market. [alarm ringing] [faucet running] I want to establish a friendly relationship with the client through an advertising idea that can be summed up in two words, that's all. Mr. Wajih? I have an idea that might save you another meeting with us. What's this?

 This is a one-dollar bill, so it could be in the hands of any person in the country. We'll release it, and it will pass from one hand to another and go from one pocket to the next. And the owner of the bill with the right number wins a valuable prize from the bank. [Wajih] One million dollars. [Tarek] Hello. [Maroya] Hello, sir. How can I help you? [Zeina] We want to see the owner of the house. Who is it, Maroya? [Maroya] Ma'am, someone is here to see you. [Jinan] No, dear, I haven't forgotten at all. Thank you.

 My husband and I really liked you guys as well. I haven't forgotten. We'll talk about it tonight over dinner. Yes. Yes, sure. Don't worry. [in French] Bye. [in Arabic] I'm sorry. I had a very important phone call. Welcome. Uh, we want to apologize for showing up here unannounced. It's okay. Never mind. But I'm still not sure... What is the purpose of your visit? It's about the fortune-teller. [in English] Sorry? The fortune-teller who came into your place five minutes ago. Mmm. [in Arabic] I don't understand. Anyway, you are welcome. You may finish your juice. Ma'am, we came here in good faith. We only want one thing... I don't have what you want. You do, and you know you do. What do I know? And what fortune-teller are you talking about? Ma'am, let's stop wasting time and get to the point. I don't give a damn about all this change you made or why you did it. We all know that you're the fortune-teller we were chasing down the street and who came into this house five minutes ago. You know, you're wasting my time. And I have no intention of listening to you or to him. Now get out of my home. [tisking] No, ma'am. No, no. Let me tell you, ma'am, we're not going anywhere before we understand everything. - Oh, is that so? - Mmm-hmm. By the way, I can call security. They will throw you out of my home right away. Why go to such lengths? What are you afraid of? I'm not afraid! But I simply don't have what you're asking for. Ma'am, calm down. Let's suppose that you forgot to wipe this tattoo off your chin... did you also forget who was chasing you downtown? Look at this face. Let me introduce myself. My name is Tarek, from Central Intelligence. And this is Captain Zeina from the Bureau of Investigations. We've been watching you for a while, and we need an explanation for everything you're doing. Don't forget the small child you tried to kidnap earlier. I saw you. [Jinan] This is his bedroom. He chose everything himself. The furniture, the colors... The toys... He used to spend most of his time in here by the easel. He used to love drawing. Whenever he would draw something, he would stick it on the wall over here. [Zeina] Your son? Wael. Wael is my son. Wael was seven years old. It took his father and I a very long time to conceive. But when he came along, he lit up our lives. Dad would spoil him, and Mom would pamper him. [gasps softly] Then all of a sudden he was gone. In the blink of an eye, he was gone. How did it happen? I mean... how did he die? Wael didn't die. Wael isn't dead! Who said he was dead? Wael is alive. Ma'am, it's okay. Calm down. We didn't mean to... No, no, no! He's just waiting for me. He's not dead. He's not, sir. He's missing. It was a Sunday. It was a very hot day. It was the weekend... and everyone was going out and having fun. I took Wael, and we went to Jounieh. We had lunch there... and then we went for a walk. [chuckles] He saw a watch that he liked in a store window. He said, "Mom, will you buy it for me?" I bought him the watch. It was a blue watch. It matched the color of his shoes. He said, "Mom, set it to the right time." I set it to the right time... and I realized it was already 7:00. I said, "Let's go home before it gets dark." As we were walking back to the car, we saw a bunch of kids gathered around a colored van. There was a magician performing a show. His wife was helping him out, and it was packed with little kids. He said, "Please, Mom, I want to watch." I said, "Okay." I don't know how I got distracted. I'd never let him out of my sight before. All of a sudden, Wael was gone. Have you tried to go to the media? Like television or the internet? Someone might recognize his picture and lead you to him. There's nothing in the world I haven't tried. In your opinion, someone who was desperate enough to disguise herself as a fortune-teller and walk in the streets... hoping to find her son, if only by chance, wouldn't she have tried every possible way in the world? [Jinan sniffles] That's my story. We'll do everything we can to help you. Are you serious? What can you do? Just relax, and don't worry. But let's be very honest. What do you think, Zeina? Go ahead. No, you go ahead. No, no, you go ahead. [Tarek sighs] Mrs. Jinan, you can trust us completely. Of course. I would do anything for my son. Great. Excellent. This means, as of right now, I'm going to start helping you. But on one condition. Whatever I ask of you, you don't ask why. You know, our work depends on secrecy. Deal? I don't understand. Mrs. Jinan, do you want your son back or not? Of course I want him back. I'm willing to give my life just to hold my son again. No, you only have to pay one dollar. One dollar? Yes. There's a specific dollar that you have here in your house. Let's just say it's a piece of evidence that we lost, and you're the only one who can help us get it back. Oh. Obviously, you two have nothing to do and are just looking for some amusement, and, like a fool, I sat here and listened to you. Calm down, ma'am. That wasn't our agreement. There wasn't any agreement, miss! Of course there was. You just said you would give your life to have him back. So you must help us find him. Yes! Tell me how much you need, and I'm ready to pay. It's okay. Let me handle it. Mrs. Jinan, we just want to help you. We ask nothing in return. This is our job. Really? Just now, he said he wanted one dollar. Yes, absolutely. It's just a bit complicated and hard to understand. Who sent the two of you to mess with me? Because I can tell something is not right. Your time is up. Please, get out of here! You're just agitated because the incident with your son is still fresh. You need to relax and calm down, and you need to help us so that we can help you. Time is not on our side. You're the ones wasting my time. I don't need your help anymore. Please, get out of my home. Are you kidding? All this because of a dollar? Of course it's not about the dollar! This is my son! I'm a mother! A mother who's grieving the loss of her son! And you're asking me about a dollar? I lost my son for God's sake! Do you have any idea what that's like? It's not just a dollar! What if we find your son? Then will you give us the dollar? I'll give you one million dollars. What do you think? There's something strange about that woman. Something's not right. God help her. She's going through a lot. God help us all. What's wrong, Captain? Why are you looking at me like that? Nothing. What do you mean "nothing"? I'm just thinking about what we can do to help her. We have to find her son, no matter what it takes. For the dollar? Zeina, what's your problem? Am I the only one who's after the dollar? We're both after it. Yeah, but... "But" what? We're here for the dollar. Whatever else we do is just a favor, to help those in need. Okay, sorry. Let's go. The car is parked far away. [gasps] Shit, shit! Kinza! I forgot she was in the hospital. I left her at the hospital! [Kinza groans] My head... Does your nose hurt? I can't feel my face. [groans] [in French] Okay, easy. [in Arabic] Oh, my head... Miss, I put the things in the kitchen. I have to go, do you need anything else? [in French] No, thank you. [in Arabic] Wait, wait! Uh, I want you to get me some medication from the drugstore. [softly] Where are you going? Downstairs. I can't sleep here with two beautiful young women, like you said. Are you making fun of me? I'm not. I'm going out to start looking for that boy. The woman said that everyone with connections has tried to help her. What do you want me to do? Do you have a better idea? - I don't know. But we need to think fast. - [Kinza groaning] You know what? We shouldn't have left her apartment without the dollar. How, though? By force? Didn't you see how she freaked out in the end and kicked us out? It wasn't the right time to mention the dollar. That's why we need to solve all the problems one by one. Hmm. I think you should start in Jounieh. Why Jounieh? The woman said her son disappeared on Sunday. Today it's Saturday. That means he's been missing for almost a week. That's if he wasn't abducted. That's why you need to start in Jounieh. Maybe someone saw him there. A seven-year-old boy wearing blue shoes and a blue watch. A blue watch? Maybe I can start by checking the store they bought it from. - That's it. You're starting to get it. - Mmm. Also, check the restaurant where they ate. But she didn't say which restaurant. Check all the restaurants. [scoffs] Mmm? Also, ask about that magician and his wife. Maybe he went back to him. Okay. Yes, ma'am. I'll keep you updated. - Tarek! Tarek! The magician! - What about him? She said he owned a colorful van. You mean Rafi? Yes. Why didn't we think of him sooner? Because the only thing she said was that he owned a colorful van. So you can only understand if she had said a hundred-year-old Volkswagen. Is that it? Okay, fine. I have his number. I'll call him right now. Hello? Hi, Rafi. It's Tarek. Tarek, Tarek. The impounded van, the bicycle, the dollar. That's right. Sorry to call at this hour. Thank you. Can we meet? Yes, right now. It can't wait. You're the man. Okay. I'm on my way. Did you call him? I did, and he's waiting for us. Where did he say he was? A few blocks away. Really close. He's in Sidon. Welcome, welcome. [chuckles] [in French] Thank you, thank you. [in Arabic] You don't have to. You're most welcome. Have you been here long? Just since yesterday. I heard that the county is hosting a small festival and many people will attend, so I thought I'd come to make some cash. How's Naya? She's great. She's sleeping. Would you like me to wake her? Of course not! Poor thing. Let her sleep. She misses you guys so much. Whenever she rides her bicycle, she thinks of you. She's so sweet. When you come to Beirut, give us a call. We're in a bit of a hurry right now. In a hurry? What's the matter? Is everything okay? You've got me worried. Frankly, we're here to ask you about an issue that's a bit delicate. I just need you to pay attention and remember as much as you can. Don't worry. My memory's a steel trap. What's the matter? There's a certain woman that we care about. Last Sunday, there was an incident, and she says you were there. Last Sunday? An incident? I was there? This woman was watching your show with her son. Her son got lost in the crowd, so we thought maybe he came back to you, or maybe someone mentioned him to you. I don't remember anything like that. Are you sure it was me, or is that just what she said? She doesn't know your name, but once she described your vehicle, we knew it was you. I don't know anything about this. [softly] We haven't learned anything new. Let's go. Okay, Rafi, one more question. You see a store selling kid's watches near the place you were at in Jounieh? I haven't been to Jounieh for two months. Wait, wait, wait. Two months, you say? But last Sunday you were there with your wife. Come on. With my wife? My wife's been dead for years. What are you talking about? May she rest in peace. Tarek, Rafi told us that his wife died years ago. How could I forget? Let's go to Jounieh, then, and we'll ask about a boy wearing blue shoes... - And a blue watch? - Yes. Do you remember him? [laughing] Do I remember him? Tell us what you know. You tell me! You're talking about Jinan, right? - [continues laughing] - Do you know her? I'm just wondering how it's possible that you know her! It was a coincidence. How does she do it these days? Does she pretend to have an injury? Is she a delivery person? A maid? Which is it? A fortune-teller. Poor woman, she's crazy. Believe me, she's crazy. Are you just going to keep laughing? Tell us something useful. Poor woman, she's crazy. Ever since she lost her son, she totally lost it. Crazy? It's an old story. It happened 15 years ago. What are you talking about? She said she lost him on Sunday. Yes, it was a Sunday, but which Sunday? She's been searching for her son in the streets for 15 years. Poor woman. God help her. And how did she lose her son? No idea. All I know is that her husband is the famous heart surgeon Marwan Ibrahim. I can't tell you how many times we've had to call him because she was in some kind of trouble. Funny you don't know of her. You've never heard about her? Where would we have heard about her? Anywhere, the whole country talked about her. They talked about her on TV, on that show with the guy... That host with the glasses. What's his name? It doesn't matter. Just tell me. If we go see Dr. Ibrahim, will he be able to help us? I don't know. You'll just have to try. What do you think, Tarek? Do you have a better idea? Tell me, are you still looking for it? What's the deal with this dollar? You'll understand when the time comes. I promise. No, he's not here. But Dr. Marwan is. Dr. Marwan, a call for you. Hello? He won't buy it. Let me remind you that his wife is the crazy one, not him. Who said we're here to trick the guy? It's just one question. He answers, and that's it. Yes, but we're asking about something that's really hard to ask about. - It's just a dollar! - Because it's a dollar. You think it's normal to ask someone you don't know about a dollar and make it sound as if it's a matter of life and death? You know, you're right. If you were asking me about that, I'd call the nuthouse on you. You're talking about it like it has nothing to do with you. Don't start arguing. Let's focus on the situation. When he comes in, I'll get straight to the point. Right away, "Hey, where's the dollar?" Please, sit down. We apologize for coming without an appointment, doctor, but it's a bit of an emergency. Who's the patient? Is it you or this young lady? We're here about your wife. Mrs. Jinan, your wife. We're really sorry. We know it's a delicate matter, but if it wasn't urgent, we wouldn't have come here. You, too? What has she done this time? There's no need, ma'am. You were victims of my wife, Jinan. But believe me, it's not her fault. It's all my fault. [sighs] [sighs] We were having a picnic, and Wael was with us. And due to the nature of my work, I can't take leave. I was worried they might call me from the ER. And they did. They called me from the hospital for an emergency. We packed everything quickly, and we left. I'm sorry, but... Did you forget Wael there? No. Wael was with us in the car, and I was driving really fast. 140 or 160 kilometers per hour. I don't remember. All I can remember is the sound of Jinan screaming at me. "Slow down. What's gotten into you?" And all I thought about... was the patient who was waiting at the hospital. I felt I was responsible for everything in the world, except for the most important thing, my family. I'm sorry, we didn't mean to reopen old wounds. [sighing] My wounds were never healed. Every day, every hour, every minute... I remember the accident. [exhales heavily] May he rest in peace. What? Wael is dead? But not in Jinan's mind. She's still believes she will find him. Even after 15 years, she still can't accept he's dead? Because she didn't witness his burial. Jinan was in a coma and only woke up after we'd buried Wael. [Marwan sighs] Anyway, you haven't told me how I can help you. Just allow me, after all you've told us, to get right to the point. Go ahead. Your wife has a one-dollar bill that belongs to us. A one-dollar bill? You came in here at this hour, and you sat there while I told you my life story... for a dollar? Honestly, this dollar belongs to me and my wife. It's a long story. I hope you understand. [scoffs] I'll play along. How did the dollar end up with my wife? She was pretending to be a fortune-teller, and she put the dollar in her cleavage. So I think it's still with her, or it could be in her clothes. Oh, right. Maroya did ask me about that. About the dollar? Who's Maroya? She's our maid. She was organizing Jinan's wardrobe, and she found some change in her clothes. I told her to keep it, that it was nothing. Doctor, can you ask her? Can you call her at home and ask her where she put the change? Uh, she's off today. Usually she goes out on Sundays with her friends. They go to mass and then spend the day together. If you want, I'll give you her number, and you can get in touch with her. [music playing in distance] [indistinct chatter] There she is. That's Maroya. Hello. Hi, who are you? - How are you, Maroya? - Maroya? Maroya? [in English] Maroya! Party! Welcome, welcome! [Tarek] Maroya! [indistinct chatter continues] Who are these people? Maroya, you don't remember us? - Maroya? - Yes, yes... Yesterday, Mr. Marwan gave you some change... [in English] Money, money! - [in English] Money? - Money, money! Mr. Marwan gave you money! Easy, calm down. [in Arabic] Talk to her, or I'll tear this place apart right now. [in English] Maroya, listen to me. [in Arabic and English] Yesterday, Mr. Marwan gave you money! Money! Money, Mr. Marwan... Where's the money? That's exactly what I said to her. [woman coughs] No smoking. No. You have one minute. Get the dollar, or else I'll turn this place into a bloodbath! [in Arabic] What's the matter, Tarek? Now that we're almost there, you want to ruin everything? [girl shushing] [in Tagalog] Maroya is coming. Maroya is coming. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Maroya Happy birthday to you ♪ [in Tagalog] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ [in English] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ [all clapping] [in Tagalog] Thank you. [all in Tagalog] You're welcome! [in English] Happy birthday. [in English] Thank you. [in Arabic] I wish you a long life! [in Arabic] Thank you. Listen, uh... [in Arabic] I don't want to take much of your time, it's your birthday... We're here for the money, the money. [in English] No, no need for money, this is better than money. Mrs. Jinan, the house you work at... There was some money that Mr. Marwan gave you. We want to see it. No, that money is with Mama. [in Tagalog] Maroya, your father is on the phone. [in Tagalog] Hi, Papa, thank you. These are my friends. [in English] Hi! [Maroya's father in Tagalog] Happy birthday, dear. [in Arabic] Excuse me, sir! [speaking Tagalog] [in Arabic] Pay attention! The money that was with Mrs. Jinan. [in Arabic] The money that was with Mrs. Jinan is with Mama. She's saying "Mama" again! Uh, Maroya, Mr. Marwan gave you money, okay? There's one dollar. We just want this dollar. Mister's money is with Mama. Hey, pay attention. Otherwise, I'll have Mrs. Jinan fire you. The money is with Mama there, not Mrs. Jinan. That's Mama? That's Mama. Mama, there's a dollar. Where is it? [in English] One dollar. [in English] Yes, Mama. Maroya gave you one dollar. - [in Arabic] Where is it? - One dollar. Yes, yes, yes. This one dollar, where is it? One dollar. All she can say is "one dollar." [man] One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! Buy any piece for one dollar! Wait, can you hear this? [man] One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! Buy any piece for only one dollar! One dollar! [man] One dollar, one dollar, one dollar! One dollar! One dollar, one dollar, one dollar! One dollar! Buy any piece for only one dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! Buy any piece for one dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! Buy any piece for one dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! Buy any piece for one dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! Buy any piece for one dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! One dollar!

Buy any piece for one dollar! [in English] You're welcome. One dollar! One dollar! One dollar! [in Arabic] Hi. I have a question. Do you sell any of these things for one dollar? [in Arabic] I've been screaming all day, "Buy any piece for one dollar." Even this? What do you want this for? These items here and the ones outside are one dollar. How can I help you? In fact, we don't want to buy anything. We're just looking around. I thought you didn't look like my usual customers, and I don't think you would need anything from here. You're with the press, aren't you? You're with the press. [Tarek clearing throat] Inspectors? I swear, the minute you came in, I could tell. I swear, we have receipts for everything, and it's all legal. Frankly, the owner of the store doesn't have a commercial license. - Ah, there's no license. - Ah. Mmm. But... but he applied for it. I swear he applied for it. We just need some time, a little time, and then we'll have it. Look... Listen, let's just forget all this shady business you do with your boss. But here's the thing. We never forget anything. Like she said, we never forget anything. Pay attention. Hold this. [man] Okay. I want you to exchange it for me, dollar for dollar. Dollar for dollar. I swear, I haven't got any dollars left. Besides, what is this about? Why this demand for one-dollar bills? Sorry? Was anyone already here asking for the same thing? Yes, someone called a while ago. He came and got every one-dollar bill I had. And this was the third time. Did you ask him why he needed them? I did, but instead of answering my question, he gave me... A hundred dollars? That's why I spent all week collecting one-dollar bills. I got them from several places. Oh. And, honestly, I don't really care about his reasons. His name and number, now. Hurry. Yeah, but... No buts. Here, here... Give me the $100 bill. There are no buts. Give us his name and number, or I'll shut down this store. I'm warning you. I saw. Yes, sir. They call him... "The Cleaver."
