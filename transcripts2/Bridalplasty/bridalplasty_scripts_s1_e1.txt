IT'S UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT I'VE EVER SEEN, LET ALONE STEPPED FOOT IN. >> MY NAME IS CHEYENNE, AND I'M FROM HAMBURG, NEW JERSEY. THIS IS OUR HOUSE. THIS IS MY FIANCE, SCOTT. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT ME, UH, GETTING ANY PLASTIC SURGERY DONE? NOSE JOB? CAN YOU SEE IT? SEE THE NOSE? >> THE NOSE, UNDERSTANDABLE. OKAY, I GOT THAT. >> HE'S OKAY WITH THE NOSE. I THINK MY BEST PHYSICAL FEATURE IS PROBABLY MY STOMACH. I HAVE LIKE A FLAT STOMACH, BUT THAT'S LIKE THE ONLY THING I REALLY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. HOW ABOUT WE GO OVER LAUNDRY? LIKE HOW TO DO IT. I WAS AN ONLY CHILD GROWING UP, SO I'M NOT GOOD WITH DOING THINGS BY MYSELF. >> Woman: WHAT SIZE LOAD? >> DO YOU LIKE THAT STUFF? LIKE YOU SAID IT'S SO EASY.

I'VE EVEN GOT LIKE SOME OF THE GLASSES THAT I STARTED MAKING FOR SOME OF THE GIRLS. DURING THE PROCESS OF PLANNING OUR WEDDING, I WAS LAID OFF. AND THEN AS A DOUBLE WHAMMY, THEN HE WAS LAID OFF A MONTH AFTER ME. BOXES OF BUBBLES, MY WEDDING SHOES. I DON'T HAVE THE DRESS. MAN. I'M GETTING SICK OF THE BAD LUCK AT THIS POINT.

SO IF THERE CAN BE SOMEBODY THAT CAN COME OUT OF THE LITTLE GENIE BOTTLE AND WAVE THEIR LITTLE WAND AND WHOOSH AND CHANGE ME, I'D BE LIKE, YES! I THINK THE HARDEST PART FOR ME IS GONNA BE THE FACT THAT I'M GONNA BE AWAY FROM YOU SO LONG. I'M SACRIFICING LEAVING MY FIANCE, WHO IS SO DEAR AND IMPORTANT TO ME. IT'S HARD.

A FABULOUS, OVER-THE-TOP, HOLLYWOOD, GLAM-STYLE WEDDING WITH SOME PLASTIC SURGERY, OKAY? I'M READY TO DO THIS. I WANT TO COMPLETE MY FAIRY TALE, AND I'M GOING TO.

IN FRONT OF YOUR PICTURES, YOU WILL SEE A STACK OF MAGNETIC PUZZLE PIECES. WHEN YOU PUT THESE PIECES TOGETHER, THEY'LL FORM AN IMAGE OF WHAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY LOOK LIKE AT THE END OF YOUR JOURNEY.

I'M LIKE-- I'M LOOKING AT MY PUZZLE AND IT LOOKS CORRECT. I'M LIKE, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG. >> IF I DON'T GET THIS PUZZLE RIGHT, THERE'S SO MUCH AT STAKE-- NOT GETTING THE DREAM WEDDING, NOT GETTING THE PLASTIC SURGERY, WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO ME.

WHERE'S ALEXANDRA? >> ALEXANDRA, ASHLEY, I'M SORRY BUT YOU'RE THE LAST TWO, THE BOTTOM BRIDES. BUT WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT YOUR TIME HERE AT THE HOUSE NOW IS IN JEOPARDY. >> I LITERALLY JUST SAW MY DREAMS SHATTER. THE PICTURE, THE OUTLINE OF MY BODY, IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I WANT IT TO LOOK ON MY WEDDING DAY. AND I'M LITERALLY IN TEARS AND I'M LIKE, OH, MY GOSH, I'M GOING HOME FIRST. >> ♪♪♪ >> LIKE WE'RE SO HAPPY WE ALL MADE IT, BUT THERE'S TWO PEOPLE UP THERE. >> AND THAT'S SAD FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY WENT THROUGH THIS JOURNEY THAT WE JUST WENT THROUGH. COULD YOU IMAGINE? >> WE'RE SITTING AROUND AT THE INJECTABLES PARTY, AND WE'RE NOTICING THERE ARE TWO GIRLS THAT ARE MISSING, ASHLEY AND ALEXANDRA. >> I WOULD HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED, TOO. >> ♪♪♪ >> I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THESE INGREDIENTS IN SKIN CARE. >> Dominique: LIKE COFFEE BEAN? >> YEAH. COFFEEBERRY, YEAH. >> HI, LADIES. >> All: HI. >> UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE SOME BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO. SO DR. DUBROW AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL NURSES, IF YOU COULD STEP OUT SO WE COULD HAVE A MOMENT?

SO THAT MEANS ONE OF THEM WILL BE GOING HOME RIGHT NOW. >> OH, GOD. >> HERE I AM, UP FOR ELIMINATION AGAIN IN THE FIRST WEEK. I CANNOT BE THE FIRST ONE TO GO HOME.

OH, GOD. >> AND I'M JUST THINKING, OH, [BLEEP], I'M GONE. >> THIS WEEK'S DECISION IS GONNA BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE REST, BUT ULTIMATELY IT WILL ALWAYS BE IN YOUR HANDS. >> I'M THINKING, THIS IS GREAT. I MAY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEND ALEXANDRA HOME. >> I'M KIND OF AT THESE PEOPLE'S MERCY. AND THAT'S A VERY VULNERABLE, SCARY PLACE TO BE. >> WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A SIMPLE HAND VOTE, BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT, I'D LIKE TO LET ALEXANDRA AND ASHLEY SPEAK TO YOU. ASHLEY? >> [ SNIFFLES ] I REALLY LIKE KNOW THAT I DESERVE THIS BECAUSE I HAVE TO WALK IN HERE AND LOOK AT EVERYBODY WITH THE RING ON THEIR FINGER. AND I DON'T HAVE THAT. >> I DO FEEL THAT ASHLEY'S DECISION TO PAWN HER RING DID AFFECT MY VOTE, BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF UNTHINKABLE. >> Ashley: SHE'S ALREADY HAD HER TIME. THIS IS MY FIRST CHANCE. >> Shanna: ALEXANDRA, IT'S YOUR TURN TO SPEAK. >> WELL, IF ANY OF YOU ALL KNOW MY STORY, I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO GO HOME FIRST. I WENT HOME FIRST, THE FIRST WEEK ON "THE BIGGEST LOSER," SO I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. I JUST REALLY WANT A CHANCE TO COMPLETE MY, MY FAIRY TALE. >> IT'S LIKE, YOU ALREADY HAD YOUR MOMENT IN THE SPOTLIGHT. YOU ALREADY GOT PROPOSED TO ON NATIONAL TV. LIKE NOBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE GOT THAT OPPORTUNITY. >> I REALLY WOULD LIKE A CHANCE TO TRY JUST ONE MORE TIME TO MAKE IT PAST THE FIRST ROUND AND TO JUST REALLY LIKE EVEN SEE IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO EVEN JUST HAVE THIS DREAM WEDDING. >> OKAY, LADIES, THANK YOU.

THAT'S ONE VOTE FOR ALEXANDRA TO STAY IN THE HOUSE. >> ON "THE BIGGEST LOSER," SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ONE TO GO HOME. I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO HER AGAIN. I KNOW I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT. >> Shanna: ALLYSON, THAT MAKES TWO VOTES FOR ALEXANDRA TO STAY. KRISTEN, THAT'S A THIRD VOTE FOR ALEXANDRA TO STAY. ALEXANDRA, YOU NOW HAVE FOUR VOTES. ASHLEY, YOU HAVE SIX. >> IF YOU PAWN YOUR RING BECAUSE YOU NEED FOOD ON THE TABLE, THEN LIKE I'M OKAY WITH THAT. BUT HELL NO. I WOULD TAKE THE BUS DAY IN AND DAY OUT TO GET TO AND FROM WORK IN ORDER TO KEEP THAT RING. >> Shanna: LAST CHANCE TO LOCK IN YOUR VOTES. ALEXANDRA, YOU NEED TWO MORE VOTES, OR YOU'RE GOING HOME. RAISE THEM UP HIGH, PLEASE. ALEXANDRA, YOU HAD SEVEN VOTES. ASHLEY, YOU HAD THREE. CONGRATULATIONS, ALEXANDRA. ASHLEY, I'M SORRY. YOU ARE THE FIRST ONE TO BE ELIMINATED FROM "BRIDALPLASTY." YOUR WEDDING WILL STILL GO ON, BUT IT JUST MAY NOT BE PERFECT. >> [ SAD MUSIC PLAYS ] >> Shanna: I KNOW THAT WAS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT, BUT IT'S ONLY GONNA GET HARDER FROM HERE. >> I'M MORE UPSET ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THE CHANCE TO COMPETE FOR THE SURGERIES. A LOT OF THE GIRLS ALREADY HAVE A FAIRY TALE GOING ON. I'M STILL TRYING TO PIECE MINE TOGETHER THE BEST WAY I CAN. AND, YOU KNOW, IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT. >> I AM REALLY GOOD FRIENDS WITH LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT DID VOTE FOR ME, BUT THE OTHER ONES, JENESSA, MELISSA, LISA MARIE, THEY WERE STILL LIKE, "OH, ALEXANDRA!" LIKE TRYING TO BE NICE TO ME, 'CAUSE THEY KNOW, IF I WIN ANOTHER CHALLENGE, OH, YOU GOT IT COMING, BITCH. YOU DO. DON'T TRY TO VOTE ME OUT OF THIS HOUSE AND THINKING THAT WE'RE GONNA BE FRIENDS. >> [ LAUGHTER ] >> THIS SEASON ON "BRIDALPLASTY"... OKAY, LADIES, YOU'LL BE LEAVING FOR YOUR PLASTIC SURGERY IMMEDIATELY. >> Dr. Dubrow: LET'S GO DO THIS. >> I WANNA LOOK "VOLUMPTUOUS." >> OH, MY GOD, I LOVE IT. >> Dominique: I WANTED TO GET MY NOSE FIXED FOR SO LONG. >> [ ALL SCREAMING ] >> IT'S BITTERSWEET. I WANT TO BE IN THAT ROOM. I WANT TO BE RECOVERING. >> Melissa: DO YOU THINK YOU COULD SHOW ME YOUR BREAST SCARS? I'M DEFINITELY CONSIDERING CHANGING MY VOTE, BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. >> Jenessa: MELISSA'S A LITTLE NAIVE. SHE NEEDS TO SUCK IT UP A LITTLE. >> IF I GO HOME TOMORROW, I'M NOT GONNA GET MY [BLEEP] SKIN FIXED. I WANT THIS TUMMY TUCK. I WANT IT MORE THAN ANYONE IN THIS HOUSE. >> HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY HESITATIONS ABOUT GETTING MARRIED TO SCOTT? >> NO. >> [ GASPS ] >> Man: ARE YOU SATISFIED WITH YOUR SEX LIFE? >> NO. >> "SEE YOU THIS AFTERNOON AT THE MOST EXCLUSIVE WEDDING DRESS STORE IN BEVERLY HILLS." >> [ ALL SCREAMING ] >> HERE'S MY STYLE. I'M A DIVA, I'M A CURVY LADY, AND I WANT TO LOOK GOOD. >> TIME TO STRUT YOUR STUFF. >> ALEXANDRA AND HER DRESS ARE ALL THAT STAND BETWEEN ME AND MY BOOB JOB. >> Shanna: THE WINNER OF "BRIDALPLASTY" WILL GET A FIJI VACATIONS HONEYMOON PACKAGE. >> MY DREAMS ARE BECOMING A REALITY. >> FIJI. >> OH, MY GOD. >> FORMING THE ALLIANCE JUST MADE SENSE. I WILL GIVE YOU MY WORD THAT IF IT'S YOU AND MELISSA IN THE BOTTOM NEXT WEEK, I WILL VOTE FOR YOU. THIS IS REALLY GONNA BE A TEST OF WHETHER I'M REALLY THE PUPPET MASTER OR NOT. >> ALL THE FAKE-ASS BITCHES UP IN HERE, THEY'RE GONNA BE THE ONES STANDING AT THE END IF NO ONE STOPS THEIR ASSES. >> THERE IS CLEARLY AN ALLIANCE, AND I DON'T LIKE THAT SNEAKY BULL[BLEEP]. >> ALLYSON'S VOTING FOR ME.
