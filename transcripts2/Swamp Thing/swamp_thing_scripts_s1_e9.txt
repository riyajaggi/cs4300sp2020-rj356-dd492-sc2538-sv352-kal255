 [narrator] Previously on Swamp Thing... Cheer up, buttercup. It worked. Forgive me if I don't gloat over the death of my husband. - [gunshot] - [Avery groans] Maybe if I put in a good word, you might wanna do me a favor. A favor? You did this on purpose to me? Yes, and it worked. [screams] The cure for your Alzheimer's rests in the cells that I saw under that microscope.

 [Caroline] Have you seen my pills? I thought I set them on the counter. [Jason ] That's 'cause you already took them. I'm slowly losing my mind. [Ellery] Dr. Arcane. We're here to discuss one of your patients. Alec Holland. He needs to be brought in for treatment. What do you mean? Things could get violent. Stay the fuck away from Alec. [door slams] Do you think it's possible to cure Holland? Do you want to cure the goose of laying golden eggs?

 That man saved my life. [Jason] I suggest that we let him save millions more. [man] Move in. [objects rattling] [Caroline] What... Who's there? [Jason] It's okay. It's just me. [breathing heavily] I'm so sorry. Your clothes... You're a muddy mess. And where have you been? It's all right. I... I had to go to the swamp, remember? That awful place? Yeah, I have to. Just for a bit. You're leaving again? I found it. I found it, Caroline. A specimen more incredible than anything I dared imagine. What's wrong? - Hey, hey, hey. - No... Hey... Why are you trembling? [exhales] I... I had a nightmare. [sighs] That's all right. I'm here with you now. [chuckles] It was dark. I was outside. I could hear... water... insects. I was looking for you. I kept calling your name. Jason... Jason... But you never answered. I was so afraid something had happened to you. And then I saw a man, lying on the ground. He wasn't moving. He looked dead. It was all just a bad dream, Caroline. The doctor said that you might be experiencing more of them as... - I remember, Jason... - Darling, please. Now what I want you to do is just forget all about it, eh? Take your morning medication before you go. Finish your reading. And later, when I'm back, we can celebrate. If what I suspect is true, all of this confusion, feeling all this misery of this awful disease. I'll be able to make it all go away. - Hmm. - Just like I promised. [lock clicks] Okay? Okay. Jason, wait. The man in my dream... I was afraid because I thought it was you. [gas hissing] But when I got closer, I realized it wasn't you. It was a... monster. [theme music playing] Liz? Jeez, I thought you'd be back hours ago. Alec's missing. What? [Abby] I went out to the water to find him, but he was gone. I found these not far from the lab. - Fired recently. - Yeah. It was like a war zone. I found these tracks in mud like something big had been dragged away. I think someone's taken him, Liz. - You think the CDC's involved? - No, no, no. This goes way, way beyond Atlanta. Harlan's been reassigned. I've been kicked off my own investigation. Suddenly people are showing up and asking questions about Alec Holland. They knew about his condition, about his regenerative abilities. I don't... I don't... Who even knows Holland's... Woodrue. Has to be. I... [sighs] I gave him a tissue sample before I left. So, what are we dealing with? I don't care. I'm not giving up on Alec. I know that I've completely turned your life upside down. I know. But if... - you could please help me... - [sighs] ...I could really use it right now, Liz... Look, Abby. You and me, seventh grade. I... It was a long time ago. Not so long. We were walking home from school and this pick-up drives by and the driver yells something disgusting at me. The other kids we were with just laughed it off. You got the license plate and then I got it published in the Weekly. - My first story, actually. - Mmm-hmm. Yeah. You always had my back, Abby, and I got yours. Okay. So, what's the plan? Woodrue could know where they took Alec. And then? Haven't got that far yet. Make sure he's damn good and secure. [man] Yes, sir. [gas hissing] [machine beeping] [Jason] Don't! Don't touch it. You could contaminate the specimen. Well, are you sure that he... it's still alive? Plant seeds have survived the most extreme climates imaginable, only to germinate years, even centuries later. And these lights? Green spectrum. It's been known - to inhibit plant growth. - [switch clicks] Should the need arise, it'll slow the creature's regenerative capabilities. You mean, if the poor bastard wakes up. Fortunately for everyone involved, it's highly unlikely. [Vendetti] The lab is all powered up. And backup generators are set just in case. Anything else? Yes, for you to leave. You got it all figured out, huh? How long do you think it'll take to do your initial assessment? Less time if I'm alone. I got a few things I need to attend to anyway. You let me know what you find out. - [nozzle squeaking] - [gas hissing] We'll let you thaw out a little. Then I'll have a look under the hood. [monitor beeping] [door opens] [Daniel] Who's... Who... Who's there? [exhales] Whew. Time flies, doesn't it, Daniel? You? The studio guy. I'm really sorry about all this. Sorry? You're the reason I'm stuck here. That's kind of a matter of perception, don't you think? Speaking of which... There's something you need to see. What the... [echoing] Liz. Liz? [Abby] Shh. We have to hide. [rustling] [metal pipe clattering] - [door opens] - [Wyler] Go check it out. [Wyler] Over here. Spread out. Hey, hey, hey, hey. [Crane] Go. [Wyler] Electrical room. Hey... Hey, wait a second, guys. [Crane] Show yourselves. - [gun cocks] - Guys? [Crane] Last chance. Don't shoot. My name is Dr. Abigail Arcane, I'm with the CDC. We are not a threat. Please put your guns down. Take them. Abby, go! [gunshots] [Abby gasps] What's happening? You're seeing the future. Or more precisely, one possible future, that only you can change. [panting] [knocking on door] Back in the shadow of the Sunderlands again. Yeah, I know. Yes? Ms. Woodrue? It's Doctor. Yes, I'm Dr. Caroline Woodrue. Uh, I'm Dr. Abby Arcane. This is my friend, Liz. Um, is your husband home? There's something we really need to speak to him about. My husband... Is he all right? Um... Yeah, we're just... We're trying to find him. Is it okay if we come in for a moment? [door closes] I was, uh, making... tea. I'm sorry, did you say that you're friends of Jason's? [kettle whistling] Yes, we met a few days ago at Marais General. Jason is analyzing a sample I brought in. What's that sound? Um, Doctor, I, uh... I don't wanna pry... Have you been taking your medication? Medications? Yes. Of course. Every morning. Okay. Abby? Caroline, did Jason go to the swamp last night? [Caroline] I hate the swamp. I hate what this awful place is doing to Jason. He doesn't have many friends, you know. [Abby] Yeah, I understand how hard that might be. But I also have a friend, his name is Alec Holland, and I'm afraid Jason might do something terrible to him. So, I need to speak to him. I'm sorry. Did I offer you any tea? No, Doctor. Um, I'd like to check back in on you if I can. I'd like that. Okay. [Caroline] Jason... Jason's always been a brilliant man. Maybe a little too brilliant for his own good. When you find him... try to understand. Everything he's done... everything he's doing... [softly] it was for me. - [Liz] Is she... - [Abby] Yeah. Advanced-stage Alzheimer's. [exhales] Woodrue is not doing her any favors by bringing her here or leaving her in that house alone. We find him, you can tell him. [classical music playing] [Jason] Beginning vivisection on subject identified as Holland, A. Subject has sustained massive trauma from multiple gunshot wounds and nitrogen freezing. On examination, all visible epidermis appears to be infested with plant-like fibers and spores. Hmm. Shall we? [exhales] [crunching] Subject's tissue has hardened dramatically. [grunts] Indeed, "tissue" may not be the correct term for such a peculiar type of dermis at all. [crunching continues] [sighs] I have now completed the Y-incision. Now continuing through the subject's epidermal layers. [grunts] [grunts] [screaming] [panting] What are you doing to me? I checked with the hospital staff and no one's seen Woodrue since this morning. This is the photo you took? Yeah. He or someone made notes on it. Okay. This reads like what you'd need to set up a mobile medical facility. Okay. [exhales] We need to take a step back. If someone's taken Holland, they're holding him somewhere, somewhere off the beaten path. [snaps fingers] Wait a second. [typing] Real estate? What... Sunderland properties. Woodrue was working for Avery, so... Ah, so, Avery could've provided the location. Maria Sunderland's consolidating her holdings? [Liz] Yeah. These are filings for sole ownership of all these properties, all in the last 48 hours. [Abby] I wonder what Avery thinks of that. There, look. Sunderland's old cement plant. This is it. Why would a biologist be looking for an abandoned factory? Because he has something to hide. [gasps] Why are you doing this? Well, you might say that I'm completing Alec Holland's study into the mutagen. I feel it all. I'm not sure how you're feeling anything. I've found no nerve or pain receptors to speak of. But allow me to keep looking. No. Stop! - [crunching] - [screaming] [grunts] [breathing heavily] [metal clanks] [grunts] [Swamp Thing crying] Remarkable. These are your lungs. Only they're not lungs. Human lungs have capillary tubes that let the oxygen pass through into the blood. They're something else entirely. [grunts] [Jason straining] [Jason grunts] The same with your heart. It doesn't contract, it doesn't pump blood. In fact, it doesn't appear to do much of anything. But this is curious. Your vascular system, and I use that term advisedly, appears to run through your heart. But why? None of these organs serve any discernible function whatsoever. Yet, here you are, speaking to me even now, without them. You're not making any sense. You believed that, uh, the disease that infected Marais' citizens made you into what you are. But that is not possible. [inhales] That's why I'm this way. No. No, it isn't. No, it isn't. After the explosion, your body must have mixed in with the mutagenic plant matter and the plants somehow absorbed Alec Holland's memories. His consciousness, if you will. A human consciousness that remembered having, uh, lungs, a heart, arms, and legs. And the plants did their best to replicate them. [stammers] I don't understand. No. You're not a man at all. You're a plant... that thinks it's a man. [screaming] No! Why would you show me that? Why did you show me Dr. Arcane and Liz dying? Why do you think? [monitor beeping] Is that really gonna happen? There are infinite futures. Am I supposed to do something about that one? [softly] Daniel. Did you really think that you were just gonna play the Blue Devil in a film? [sighs] Blue Devil is a character. A hero in a movie who gets his powers from a demonic suit. It's a movie! Oh, no. He's so much more than that. And so are you. Do you remember when I asked you if you were satisfied with your life? [Stranger] It's Cassidy, right? Stunts? Yeah. Would you say that you feel satisfied with things? The answer was revealing. It's too bad casting only looks at me like a stunt man. I'd give anything to have that role. So, you think you're doing me a favor? I didn't ask for any of this. - If I could get out of these restraints, I'd... - [gasps excitedly] You'd what? You'd what? I'd leave this nothing swamp town. Go fix your future yourself. I can't exactly do that. Why not? You're just gonna leave Abby and Liz to die? It's not up to me. Goodbye, Mr. Cassidy. Hey, hold up. You're just gonna leave? What am I supposed to do? Whatever you want. Life's a journey, Mr. Cassidy, and for what it's worth, I... I almost envy yours. - [door closes] - Great. No, no, no, no, no. This is not my journey. My journey was a cross-country trip back to frigging Malibu. [exhales] I don't believe this. [sighs] I can't believe this. [sighs] Hmm. I only got $640 a day to play you. It all happened so fast, I don't think I ever really nailed the character. Maybe this time, I'll finally get you right. - [energy buzzing] - [groans] [screaming] [struggling] [grunting] Maria Sunderland for Nathan Ellery, please. Yes, again. A message? Yes, as a matter of fact, I would like to leave a message. Tell him... Tell him he's not dealing with my husband anymore. Tell him Avery was plagued by... limitations. And his wife is not so predisposed. I expect to hear from Mr. Ellery immediately. [Avery] Maria. Avery. - I didn't expect to... - Oh, I'm sure you didn't. Now just... stay calm. We are only here to help you. Doctor? Who's this? Dr. Dennis Barclay, from the Barclay Psychiatric Institute. Mrs. Sunderland, why don't we come this way? Right here is fine. Very well. Maria Sunderland, I have received a court order, duly authorized, to place you in a secure holding facility while awaiting a full psychiatric evaluation. You have no right. A recent incident involving Dr. Abigail Arcane and a young child who'd been in your charge. This was the hardest decision I've ever made, but you know this is the right thing, Maria. Oh, my God. [struggling] No! [Barclay] It would be best if you didn't 'cause a fuss. God damn you, Avery. [Avery] It's okay, honey. I'm back now, and we're going to make sure you get the help you need. [inhales sharply] No. No! [Avery] You men take good care of her now. - [door closes] - I just want my beautiful Maria back. [indistinct chatter] Hey, Matty. Thought you were working tonight. Taking a personal day. Hmm. Saw your mom in here earlier. Looked like you two were really getting into it. Just not sure how I feel about the job right now. [Delroy chuckles] That'd be every day for me if I worked for my mom. I couldn't imagine. Man, she was one tough lady. Still miss her, don't you, Del? Every damn day. Listen, son, no matter how hairy it gets between you two, you gotta know Lucilia's always looking after you. [inhales sharply] Yeah, well, sometimes I wonder. [softly] Come on, can't be that bad. Maybe you ought to give her a call. Yeah, I'll get right on that. I tell you what, why don't you get me another one of these when you get a chance, huh? [car doors close] [Abby] I thought this place was deserted. [Liz] Been locked up for years. [Abby] Oh, my God. It is a mobile medical facility. Alec has to be in there. I'm going inside. You can't just charge in there. These guys have guns. Yeah, if they move Alec out of Marais, I will never find him. There should be a hole in the fence, around the side, that leads to a back door. I used to come smoke with my Uncle Luc back when he worked nights here. Don't tell Pops. Promise. [Abby whispering] We're good. [door creaking] [Liz] Where the hell are they keeping him? [Liz] Are you seeing this? Yeah. They're leading us to Alec. [indistinct conversation in distance] - [footsteps approaching] - Shit. We have to hide. [metal clangs] Go check it out! [Wyler] Let's start with the electrical room. - [Crane] Show yourselves. - They know we're in here. - Last chance. - [gun cocks] - [saw buzzing] - [generator powering up] [Swamp Thing panting] - [saw buzzing] - [Swamp Thing groaning] [Crane] We just lost all power. Drag 'em out. - [guns click] - Yes, sir. [metal clatters] - [feedback over comms] - [groans] [Wyler] Comms are down. [Crane] The hell? Lost all contact. Just open fire. [Liz] What are they shooting at? I don't know! [screaming] [screaming continues] - What the fuck is that? - Let's go. - Where'd it go? - [Hooper] Where is he? What are we looking at? [Crane] I don't got eyes. I don't got eyes. [distorted growl] - Shit. - [Gray] Fuck! [Hooper] I don't like this, guys. What are we doing? - [gun fires] - [Blue Devil growls] Shit, where's he coming from? Where? There! Fuck me. [growls] [screaming] Time to go, Doc! - I'm not finished yet. Wait. - We don't have time for this. You have to get the specimen out of here. It's covered. We're relocating to a lab in Northern Maryland. I'll collect my wife and meet you there. [Vendetti] Get to your car and go. [footsteps approaching] [door opens] [door latch opening] [gasps] [panting] It's... the devil. [Blue Devil snarls] [Abby and Liz gasping] The fuck? - Oh, my God. - [both breathing heavily] What the fuck was that? I don't know. We have to go find Alec. It's like a goddamn warzone. [Abby] He's close. Alec! Alec! [breathing heavily] That's Holland? [Abby sobbing] - [Swamp Thing] Abby. - [gasps] [Abby] What did they do to you? We have to get you out of here. - [clangs] - [Abby grunts] Can you move? The light... The light... The light... Look what these monsters did to him. [plants squelching] [Swamp Thing groans] You came for me. Who did this to you? Woodrue and Sunderland. To them, I was just a specimen. [exhales sharply] I have to go back to the cove. - I have to know if it's true. - [Abby] Wait... Alec... Alec. You have to know if what's true? [Liz] Back to the cove? He means Skeeter Cove, where his boat exploded. Why go back there? [Daniel panting] [breathing heavily] It's gone? Oh, no. I'm going to follow him. I... I have to be with him, Liz. Then I'll figure out who those guys were. That blue thing included. - Okay. - Hey. Be careful. You too. [indistinct radio chatter] [horn honking] [panting] [radio chatter continues] [pop music playing on radio] You've gotta be fucking kidding me. [radio static repeatedly interrupts music] [metal clanging] [radio continues playing] [panting] Caroline? Sweetheart? You'll never guess what I found. It's the answer that we've been searching for since... since you were first diagnosed. Organic processes, capable of... not only regenerating tissue, but thoughts, consciousness and... memories. Caroline? Caroline? - Caroline? - [shuddering] Couldn't you hear me? [Caroline whimpering] [Caroline] Remember... to take... your medication... Caroline, what did you do? - I remembered... to take... - No, no, no, no. You took them all? [Caroline groans] Oh, Caroline! [panting] Caroline. Caroline! No, no, no... You can't breathe. I'm sorry. It's my fault. I should have been here. I should have been here. Just give me a few minutes to talk to my wife, would you? [Avery inhales sharply] White's always been a good color for you. I don't know what's more impressive. That you're still alive, or that you managed to get me in here at all. Which judge did you bribe? Judge Murray took pity on my situation. The fact that he owed me a favor or two didn't hurt but... But I just want to see you get better, honey. - When Ellery finds out about this... - Ellery? What makes you think that Ellery is going to help you? He told me that you tried to cut me out. Now, the only way you would've thought that a plan like that would work... is if you had made a deal... with Lucilia. Wow. You must be pleased with yourself. I take no pleasure in this. I just want to know why. Why'd you do it? Just when all my hard work was about to pay off. All of the lies. Getting other people to do your dirty work. And all the nights you spent with her. You should be grateful I didn't do it sooner. It's a shame it has to end like this after all we've been through. You could've stood by my side when we reached the mountaintop. This isn't over yet. Oh, I think we both know it is. Soon as this door closes behind me. Alec, please, please, please talk to me. Why did you want to come back here? Because I have to know for sure. You have to know what? Alec. Alec, please, please talk to me. Alec! Alec, please talk to me! [breathing heavily] Alec... [exhales deeply] [Swamp Thing gasping] I am so sorry. This is Alec Holland. [meekly] No. This "thing"... is what I am. [inhales sharply] Alec Holland is dead. [theme music playing]
