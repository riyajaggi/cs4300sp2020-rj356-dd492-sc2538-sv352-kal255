 Previously on Swamp Thing... Have you seen anything more about my mission? When you'd first come to Marais, you told me you'd made a bargain. One that bound you to this town until called upon. Help! Who are you? A passing stranger, trying to help you understand the things you already know. Thought you might be coming around. Logbook says that there was only one other boat

 besides Holland's that went out that night. Let's just say, it don't look good for your boy Matt. Nobody ever fucking threatens my son. Liz Tremayne? You need to stay out of the pissing-people-off business. Hey, Liz! Back off. - You all right? - Motherfucker! Daniel! Look out! The sample that Arcane recovered, it's from a living creature. We'll talk about this in the morning. Hey, hey. Hey. You want to me to push this project forward?

 I need it alive on a table to study. Find it. It's very, very important, Abby, for me to keep you safe. Why? Because I care about you. You hardly know me. Well, you can spend your entire life with someone and hardly know them or you can meet a stranger and... just like that. You get 'em. I felt something between us. Didn't you? That was solid steel! Slow down. Avery wants him alive. To hell with that. I ain't getting my ass mauled for nobody. What the hell could do that? Whatever it is, it's jacked up on enough ketamine to take down a fuckin' zoo. Jesus... Christ! What is that? It's not going down! Quick! Get to the boat! Run! What the hell is happening? Quick! Run! Get on the boat! I was making sure Susie was safe with relatives when I heard. I... I still can't believe this. And there's no one we can call? Family? Friends? Found what I think was an old Rolodex in his shop full of scratched-out LA numbers. From his notes, they're mostly agents and old surf buddies. Well, the ventilator's keeping him breathing, but, um... His brain activity is... it's minimal. Based on these tests, I'm not sure he's gonna come out of this. I poked the bear. It's my fault, you know. No, Liz. You said you and Cassidy were mugged. It's not your fault. Yeah, well, you were dealing with a lot last night. What do you mean? Those assholes that came at us, that was a message. Don't fuck with Avery Sunderland. Avery. The bastard threatened my dad. I couldn't let it go. Liz, it doesn't make sense. Avery likes your dad. He likes my dad even better when his little girl isn't investigating certain dirty business practices. Come on. Can't be that big of a surprise. Did you go to the Sheriff? I don't have enough for a story, let alone to nail Avery. And that's even if Lucilia wasn't in his pocket. What do I do? You do nothing. I hit delete, Avery backs off, everybody walks away fine. Everyone except for Daniel. Avery's here in the hospital. I'm going to find him. Abby, let it go! Abby! Wait! It's Cassidy, right? Stunts? Yeah. Ah, was wondering when the studio would send somebody out. You think we're even gonna get a shot off tonight? Not if the D-bag at the top of the call sheet has his way. I'm sorry. It's been a long night. Don't apologize. I appreciate the honesty, actually. Yeah. So tell me... Would you say that you feel satisfied with things? Here? On set? Look at this guy. It's the most acting he's done all week. Man... It's too bad casting only looks at me like a stunt man. I'd give anything to have that role. Yeah. Well, I can sense your passion, all right. I wonder... Huh. Maybe if I put in a good word, you might wanna do me a favor. A favor? We're trying, Avery. But she's refusing all medication. Well, I don't care. What happened at the swamp was a goddamn wake-up call. Now you're a doctor. You figure it out. You give her something that will make this behavior stop. - All right, Doctor? - Okay. Avery. Thank you very much, Doctor. Take care. Hello, Abby. God, I am so relieved that you are okay. Don't. Oh, Abby, if this is about Maria attacking you like that, I honestly don't know what got into her. - I'm just sorry I wasn't there... - Stop. You threatened Delroy? You... You sent people after Liz? Excuse me. Those are serious accusations, Abby. You want serious? Cassidy's in a coma and he will probably never recover. Yes, and we're all very shook up about that boy, but if there are hospital bills to be paid, I am always here. Yeah, that's right. Because that's what you do. You hurt people and then you pretend to care. There's no pretend about it, Abby. I love this town, and I love all the people in it. When it benefits you or when it's convenient. What happens when I become inconvenient, Avery? Are you gonna send men after me? - Oh, Abby. - Don't. How can you say that to me? You are like a daughter to me. I would never ever hurt you. No. No, do you know that there was a time that I would've believed that? But you are not the man that I once knew. I took you from nothing and this is how you pay me back, Abby? Did you send those men? Abby... Go back to Atlanta. Did you send those men? Are you sure you wanna cross that line with me? Dr. Arcane to the ER. Dr. Arcane. I am not a 17-year-old girl anymore. You do not scare me the way you used to. Stay away from Liz. Abby. I'll always care about you. But if you ever accuse me like this again, I won't be so forgiving. There's something you need to see. These two were just brought in. They've been yelling about being attacked by some kind of swamp monster. Get the fuck off me, please! Calm down, sir. We'd like to help you. Did you hear what they actually saw? Sounds like it was dark, but... Their description sounds 90% like your Mr. Holland. I don't know. He couldn't have done this. Abby, you said there were times when he seemed to lose control. I know, I know. But I know Alec, and if this is him, there has to be an explanation. I hope it's a good one. Finished the incident report on Maria Sunderland. You all right? Remy Dubois' piece of shit brother came in to ID the body. Poor guy, he was... He was crying like a baby. I don't blame him. The round that I put through Remy's skull didn't... leave much to the imagination. Well, I'm sure whatever went down, it was justified. Justified? Mmm-hmm. I took a man's life, Matthew... In self-defense. To protect you. Dubois, he fuckin' saw you. - He saw me? I... - Shut up! The night Holland died, Dubois was working the docks when you took out a Sunderland boat, and that piece of hull that Tremayne's friend found, the one with the blast marks and the buckshot holes, it's a match to Holland's boat. You shot him. And then you went for the dynamite. What are you talking about? - You know me! - And I know Avery Sunderland. Holland must've been in his way, which means he needed him gone. So he found somebody he could trust, somebody he knew would keep their damn mouth shut. So now what? Well... Remy's dead and that piece from Holland's boat, the lab will just say it's inconclusive. No match. Any other loose ends? I just... I don't understand. He could've picked half this town. But he picked you. Why? Jesus, Matthew. If you needed the money, - I could've... - You'd have what? You'd have pulled a couple of dollars from your rainy day fund? Remind me again how much a small town cop makes. This is not about me. No, it's your friend Avery, and the two-inch thick file he has on you going back 30 years! What? You haven't read that one? Oh, well, I highly recommend it. It's a real beaut. Bribes, payoffs, even a couple dropped bodies in your custody, long before I ever came on. - Enough to put you away for life! - Shh! Son of a bitch. Everything I did, I did for you. No, don't... Do not put that on me. Sunderland made it very clear what he would do if I didn't go along with him on Holland. So you work for Avery now? At least it's better than sleeping with him. Do you understand what he has taken from you? I protected you, that's what I did. The same as you've always done for me. Stop. Just stop! Just stop! You know what I been thinkin'? I been thinkin' that maybe it is time to start applying to other departments. Lake Charles, Houma... I can just be done with you, Avery, and this whole... lousy town. Hey, Sheriff. Just got a call from Marais General. A couple of swamp hunters got attacked by a wild animal out on Layton's Point. Animal control can handle it in the morning. Nope, you go tonight. I want you out of my fucking sight! You know, in this business, when someone asks for a favor... No, it's nothing like that. Strictly on the up and up. My plate's just pretty full. I've got a number of other projects that I need to oversee. It'd be great if I could have someone here in Marais. Someone I could trust who could, uh... make themselves available. What are you lookin' for? Just another stunt man? No. No, you'd play a different role. After this movie, of course. Starring role? Very important role. I don't have all the details just yet. There'll be a woman coming to Marais soon. You can learn more from her. Good luck, Mr. Cassidy. - Cassidy. - What's up? The studio is fed up with Wayne's bullshit. All right? They're ready to cut their losses, unless we re-cast... like now. You've been running lines with him. They've seen the rehearsals, and they like your style. - So... - You're givin' me a shot? - At the Blue Devil? - Yeah. Hey... Where'd that studio guy go? What studio guy? Daniel? Daniel, can you hear me? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You got hurt in a fight, but you're safe, okay? - Ahh! I'm burning up! - You're okay. - I'm burning up! - Hey! It's okay! It's okay! It's okay! What the... I heard the alarm! What's wrong with me? I'm burning up! - He's awake. - Who are you? Dr. Woodrue. Sunderland's guy? Are you Daniel's doctor? No. But I heard the commotion and I... I'm sorry. When did he regain consciousness? Just now! Look at him! He's burning up! Go get a nurse. Go now. I'll stay close. You go get a nurse! Go, go, go! I made a deal. I made a deal. The stranger said I couldn't leave Marais until after I fulfilled my end of the bargain... Mr. Cassidy, you shouldn't even be awake right now. Help me, Doc! Help me! - I'm burning up! - Help! Help! Woodrue. I couldn't stop him. I'll notify the authorities. The authorities? Mr. Cassidy could be a danger to himself and others. Just... I know him. Just give me a chance to find him and bring him back. Alec? Whatever happened to those people, I know you had a reason. Did they tell you about the monster that attacked them? Alec... You were defending yourself. They were attacking you. You are suffering from a condition that we... That we don't understand. I know that you are frightened and frustrated. I'm not going to give up on you. You're still Alec Holland. Am I? I feel more in common with the green in this place than anything I've ever felt before. What's the green? Hey. We don't even know who that is. They're coming for me. This isn't going to stop. Alec! Alec? It's late and I'm tired. - This better be important. - Yes. If I understand correctly, I heard that the two hunters that you recommended to retrieve the living specimen failed. Thanks for that information. You know what? Good night, Doctor. I only mention it because you had asked for something tangible. Yeah? To justify further investment into my research. I didn't ask for something tangible. I don't care about anything tangible. I need results, Woodrue. Results. Well, perhaps you heard... There was an unfortunate incident involving a Daniel Cassidy? Word gets around. Doctors say he's in an irreversible coma. Oh, he was. Until an hour ago. Daniel Cassidy regained consciousness. He's speaking. He has full mobility. And it's supposed to mean something to me because... Mr. Cassidy suffered a grave brain injury. Chances for recovery were virtually nil. Until I intervened. What the hell you talkin' about? Mutagenic regeneration. Here. I synthesized the sample that was given to me by your Dr. Arcane. I had it administered to Mr. Cassidy. Now, remember... His condition was grave. But within hours of receiving the mutagen, it appears that his brain regenerated to the point of full consciousness. And this happened because you spun a magic potion from the sample Abby took out of the swamp. You asked for results, Mr. Sunderland. I'm giving you... a discovery that could change the world. You woke a man from a coma. That'll get attention. Indeed. Well... I'll prepare a testing regimen... No, no, no, what you're gonna do, Doctor, you're gonna write a report on your findings tonight, now. I don't understand what anything says right there, but you're gonna make a report, and you're gonna add every damn graph and colored picture you can find, but use short words. When I'm on the other end of the transaction, I insist on it. Uh, in the interim, there is something else that could be of value going forward. Go on. Dr. Arcane. She has, to this point, been reluctant to fully share information. You tell me what you need from Abby, and I'll get it for you. The hunters said they came across some tracks somewhere around here. It's the goddamn middle of nowhere. Tell me about it. All right. Take a look around. Try to identify any sign before the rain wipes it clean. We should lock down the general area, we'll come back in the light and we could... Toss me that shotgun. Yeah. Whatever it is, it's big. So if you see it, you call me. I'm gonna follow these tracks. See if I can't flush this thing out into the open. You take the skiff, get around to the other side of this inlet. Shit. Shit! Jesus. Hey, we're in the right place. Keep your eyes open. I might have something. Abby? What the fuck are you doing out here? Look, I can explain. We have to get back to the boat now. No, this is crazy. It's not safe for you to be out here. - No, please just listen to me. - No, listen to me! Okay? Two more people got attacked. We found tracks leadin' this way. Wait, you're not alone? Tyler's in the boat. What the hell is goin' on with you? - Abby, run! - Matt, don't shoot! Not him! Alec, stop it! Alec? Alec, please! It's Alec Holland. - No... No. - He's alive. That can't be. That's... That's impossible. - It's impossible! - It's not. It's not. I know, I know, I can't explain it, but he survived. And the swamp, it... it affected him, it changed him. And he's only trying to defend himself. Okay, so... so... - Holland's alive? - Yes. I know... I know it's hard to understand... But it's true. Does he, um... Does he remember anything? From the explosion or anything, that night in the swamp? The boat. Someone in the dark. A flash. I remember you. It's okay, it's okay. You were at the bridge. You came to help Abby. Matt, do you copy? Find anything? No, Matt, don't. But I gotta... I gotta respond. No, no, no, no one else can know he's here. Give me the chance to save him, please. - Matt, do you copy? - Please. Please. Cable here. Look, I thought I found something. Turns out it was just a buck deer. The call was bullshit. Headed back to where you dropped me. Jason. It's late. I'm, uh... I'm not, uh... I'm not tired. Mmm-hmm. I'll, uh... I'll be with you soon. I wanna go home, Jason. I... I understand, uh... As soon as I finish this presentation. Once we secure full funding for this project, - I'll be able to go... - Not later. Now. Tonight. I can't leave now. No, not when I'm so close. What is it? What's bothering you? Hmm? I overheard you with Sunderland. Caroline... We made the discovery of a lifetime! Imagine the possibilities! Regenerative therapies for disease that... - That could revolutionize medicine. - At what price? - What are you... - Human experimentation? You used an untested drug on a human subject. Jason! If the college regents find out... The college regents haven't had an intelligent idea in 50 years! You are a respected professor. We have had a good life. Please don't throw it away for a man like Avery Sunderland. I... I can't... I can't leave. - I can't. - I know. I can't leave. I know. I just don't wanna lose the man you used to be. Daniel? Daniel, it's Liz. Are you here? Shit! Oh, my God. Are you okay? I'm on fire, Liz. It's tearing me up. I can't take it! He's gotta know something. Where's the keys? - Where are my keys? - Who do you have to go talk to? Sunderland's guy. - That doctor. - Woodrue? It was him, Liz. Let's... Let's just... Daniel, hey. - You're still burning up. - I gotta go find Woodrue. He knows somethin', Liz. Let me just get you back to the hospital! Shit. 911. Yeah. I have a situation here. Doc! Doc! Woodrue! Doc! Woodrue! Stay inside. Lock the door. Doc... - Cassidy. - Doc... Mr. Cassidy. I can't stand this. Your recovery is truly remarkable. I'm burnin' up! Make it stop! I'll have you returned to the hospital. The testing will tell us what's provoking this reaction. What did they do? Extreme measures were required to prompt your regenerative cycle. They did this on purpose to me? Yes, and it worked. The side effects are unexpected, - but it... it worked. - Unexpected? I'm burnin' up! I can't stand this! Jason, help him! Get back inside. - You can't leave him like this! - Go back! You better settle the hell down, Cassidy. You gotta do somethin'. Doc... You gotta do somethin'. He... You gotta stop it! Don't do it! Last warning, Cassidy! This your magnificent breakthrough? There appears to be some unfortunate side effects with the regenerative process. Unfortunate? This man is psychotic. He's out of his mind with pain. Look at this. I said I needed more time for tests. Perhaps... You should postpone the investors while I find a solution for this. We're not postponing anything. As far as my investors are concerned, we have found the Holy Grail. And I expect your report to reflect that. Now you let me handle the authorities. We'll be sure Cassidy gets the help he needs. You really think you can help him? He's changed in ways I can't even understand. It's like a whole different world is pulsing through him now. Different how? He says that's something out there. A... A darkness. He says it's a force unlike anything we've ever seen. Jesus. Yeah, I know, I know this must sound so crazy to you. No, I'm... starting to get used to it by now. I'm sorry I left you in the dark about this. Are you gonna be okay? Yeah. I'll just file a report, tuck it away somewhere. Thank you. But I get it now. The reason why you've been spending so much time in the swamp. Why you didn't leave Marais with the rest of the CDC. You can still come back with me, Abby. - I can't. - I can't. I'm sorry, I have to help him. We need to talk. I know you feel trapped. Your fate was written eight years ago by forces you couldn't possibly understand. The stranger you met... He must've seen something in you. I know because I've seen it too. I should've told you more. But even now, your future remains unclear. Your mission, the reason you were tasked to Marais... is still to come. I can't change that. But I like you, Daniel. That's more than I can say about many I've met over my many years. So while I can't... I can't interfere with your destiny, perhaps I can offer you some... relief from the pain you're experiencing. Rest easy now, Daniel. We'll keep this our little secret. You're such a good boy. It's almost worth coming back just for him. Come here. - Thank you. - Here. It's strange how we keep finding ourselves here. I want to find new answers. You know, we haven't explored every medical avenue yet. It's because there's a chance that there are no answers. What am I missing? Please, please talk to me. A stranger came to me in the swamp. I think he wants me to look more deeply into this green that surrounds me. But I don't know how far that will take me away from who I was before. Away from you. Well... I'm still here. You're still... What's that? I'm not sure. Alec. Abby?
