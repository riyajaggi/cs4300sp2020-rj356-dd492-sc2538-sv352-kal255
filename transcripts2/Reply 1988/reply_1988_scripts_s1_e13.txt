 REPLY 1988 {\an8}Hey, Jung-hwan. {\an8}You should've bought a poster too. {\an8}I'm good. Listening to him sing was enough. {\an8}Hurry up, it's a long walk to the bus station. {\an8}I'm coming. {\an8}Deok-sun. {\an8}Oh, my, Bo-young, it's been so long! {\an8}I know. {\an8}You got so much prettier. {\an8}What?

 {\an8}That's not true. What are you saying? {\an8}I called you a few times after we graduated middle school. {\an8}I know. Is your phone number the same? Can I call you? Bo-young, what are you doing? Coming! Deok-sun, I have to go. Okay. Bye. -I'll call you. -Okay. -Do you know him? -No. Everyone who attended Banghak Middle School knew him. He totally had the hots for me. He wrote me tons of love letters.

 I was incredible pretty, after all. Then who was the person I knew in middle school? Pretty absurd. Stop the nonsense and wait here. I need to use the bathroom. Who was that girl? My first love. Isn't she pretty? I wouldn't call her pretty. But she's so cute, right? I was crazy about her in middle school. She's as cute as ever. You sure have strange taste. Jeez. I'm sorry. Jeez. Damn it. What a crazy punk. Damn it! Jeez. How are you so clumsy? Show me where there is even a spot where you could sprain your ankle. You couldn't sit still for a second. Do you think I wanted to sprain my ankle? It happened on my way to the bathroom. Ouch, Jung-hwan, I can't put weight on it. What do I do? Dang it. Hey. -Be careful. -Okay. You have to put pressure here. Okay, like this? You're driving me crazy. Why are you laughing? You did nothing right. Fine. You have to put your pressure here. Do you understand? -Like this? -Yes. Okay. Are you happy? No. It's too late. Shouldn't we call home? Yeah, I'll go call. Okay, hurry back. Aren't you going to sleep? I'm a senior now. I'm going to study. Then turn the TV off. No-eul, who's prettier, me or Chae Shi-ra? Who's more handsome, me or Tom Cruise? You. Chae Shi-ra. Do you want to sleep in my room tonight? No, she can't. Jin-ju is reading a book right now. What book? She can't even read. Jin-ju, I'll read that to you. Let's sleep in my room. You're leaving? Good night, Mom. Hmph! Hmphity-hmph! {\an8}FEBRUARY 1989 SSANGMUN, DOBONG, SEOUL Teacher, I mean, Father. It's 7:10 a.m., time to watch Student Quiz. I'm going back inside now. Okay, that's a great TV show. Every student should watch it. Proceed to enter! Yes, sir. -Hey, Deok-sun. -Soo-yeon. All right, already. Soo-yeon. I have a wish-- What is it? Tell me. I'll grant any wish. You competing on that show, Student Quiz. I don't expect you to win a week, month, or anything like that. I don't care if you get everything wrong, but I just want to see you on the show. -Sorry, Dad. -What do you mean? I can't grant your wish. Yeah. Very good that you're honest. Bo-ra, don't be like that, help Soo-yeon study. She's a senior now. No. I'll study at the library today. There's construction going on at the library today. Go to Taek's place to study. He's busy. I can't disturb him. That's right. Next week is his Fujitsu Cup tournament, right? Wow, if Taek wins this, he'll complete his grand slam, right? Wow, don't bother him, disturb him, or even go anywhere near him. Don't worry, I know better. Wait a minute, there's something else. Sun-woo, take this over to Taek's. -What is it? -Seasoned seaweed. It's good for high blood pressure. Bring it to Mr. Choi. Okay, I will. Mister. What are you doing here? Studying. This is the quietest place on our block. What about you this early? -Oh... -Hi, Sun-woo. My mom wanted you to have this. Thanks. Sun-woo. About your plumbing-- The plumbing at our house? Yeah. Tell your mom to leave it. I'll go and fix it later. Okay, I understand. Soo-yeon, did you eat breakfast? I did, but I can eat again. Don't go to Taek's room. You can't go in there until Saturday. I know about his Fujitsu final match. Bye. -Goodbye. -Okay. -Thank you for the meal. -Okay. Mister, did Taek eat dinner last night? No. He won't eat breakfast today either. Can you go get him? I can't disturb him during competition time. I feel like if I did, he'd keel over and die. -Taek! -Be quiet. Not this week, go elsewhere. Why, he has a match? Yeah, Futsuji. It's Fujitsu. Piss off already. {\an8}MONOPOLY {\an8}Soo-yeon, {\an8}I'll quietly play Monopoly. {\an8}I'll be really quiet. The dean's at home and things are complicated. Just don't tell me to go home. I'll be going, then. No, never. I trust you, not your blabbering mouth. Piss off. Fine, I'll go home. I'm going home. This is home. Fine. What a cruel world we live in. I'll play with the dean. Soo-yeon, come in. How did you know it was me? My dad just calls me, but you knock. Come, let's eat breakfast. It's okay. I'll just have coffee. What about lunch? What about dinner? Our Taek, don't you think you should eat breakfast? I should. Right, what a good boy. Let's go. If you eat breakfast, I won't bother you about lunch or dinner. Okay. Thanks. By the way, I've never taken my kids to that Everland. What are you doing? I'm Sung Dong-il of the Hanil Bank Investigation Department. You trying to get in handcuffs with these shenanigans you're pulling? Please reconsider the last move. Listen, there's no trick in Go-game. Don't you feel sorry for Taek? Go-game is played in the utmost fairness. By the way, it's so quiet in the house on Sunday. Is everyone gone? Mi-ran is chatting out front about the pollack. Jung-hwan is studying in his room. Speaking of which, Jung-bong hasn't left his desk today. Dong-il, my eldest son is finally coming to his senses. "Bad luck will befall anyone who has received this letter. It may be difficult, but consider this a great opportunity. I wish you seven years of good luck." {\an8}SUNG SOO-YEON {\an8}SUNG NO-EUL {\an8}KIM JUNG-HWAN {\an8}CHOI TAEK {\an8}SUNG BO-RA -Wow, look at those! -They look great. No, you should keep more for yourself. You don't need to be giving us all of these. Pollack doesn't cost a lot. Make a soup out of this tonight. Okay. It'd be so great to have this with a bit of soju. That would be great! You don't need to say another word! Shall we have a drink later? The kids are home today. How about tomorrow, after the kids have gone to school? Okay. -That's enough. -Wow, they look delicious. The men are so quiet. Are they drinking in the middle of the day? Just one shot, please. Let's just have one shot. I told you, let's just have soju. Let's try wild ginseng liquor. It'll go to waste, if you don't drink it. That's Deok-sun winning the Student Quiz type of nonsense. That wild ginseng liquor is as precious as my own life. I made it so that I can have it on Bo-ra's wedding day. Just a shot. No, one sip. Please? Oh, my, look at that. What kind of world are we living in? How are the burglars breaking into houses in broad daylight? Jeez. It's a thief! -Thieves break in just like that. -It's a thief! It's a thief! Oh, my God! -What do we do? -Thief! Where? Where is he? -He ran over there! -Where? -Let's go, Mi-ran. -No. What do we do? Where is he? Where's he going? Thief! -Where is he? -What's happened? Where? Where? Did you catch him, Dad? Where? I don't know. I think he got away. Wasn't that the ice store owner's voice? What's up with a thief in broad daylight? He got away on the roof! -I saw his backside. -Really? Yes, he ran away like a flying squirrel! That bastard, just wait until I catch him. -Nobody is hurt, right? -Yes. Who's missing here? Chief Jo. Your mother is at a seminar. Where's Mr. Choi and Taek? Taek is practicing Go-game. He probably didn't even hear. Okay, then what about his dad? His father? Sun-young, your plumbing is all fixed now. That's not important! There's a thief on the loose! Yeah, I know. I heard. Why are you all outside? It's cold today. I bet he'd be that calm, even if a crazy hog was chasing him. He's a bear, isn't he? Should I pour some hot water on him, to see if he reacts to it? What for? That's just a waste of water. Let me know if anything else needs fixing. I'll come back. Well, then. Bye. -Mother, I'll be going inside now. -Okay. -I'll be going inside too. -Bye. Oh, my. He's not human. Next time, I'll try having a loose dog behind Bonghwangdang. For sure, he'd be a little scared of that, wouldn't he? Jeez, they're all in such a rush. Are they wind in the fog? Black stars? Jin-ju. Go to Jung-bong. It's time for him to eat ramen. -Ramen? -Yeah. Sun-young. What is it? Seriously, what do you think? What do you mean? You know, about Mr. Choi. You really haven't thought about living together? What? Yeah. I wish you two... would be together. Why are you two acting like this again? Stop saying things like that. What do you mean? Your kids are all grown. It'd be great to have someone talk to. Yeah, it's not like he's a stranger. You both have been through a lot. Wouldn't it be great if you two depended on each other? I think he has some feelings for you. You two must be out of your minds. I'm already afraid the neighbors will see it that way. What are you afraid of? Why trouble yourself over something like that? You two have no idea. You don't what I feel. I was afraid of this, which is why I avoided him before. I thought people would misunderstand, like this. I took care of him when he was ill. See, people are talking again. We really don't have that kind of relationship. Don't just dismiss it like that. Just give it some thought. Mr. Choi is a great guy. What? You said he was a bear. He is a bear... but he's a rich bear. And he's good to you. Yeah, Sun-young, Jin-ju will be starting school soon. Wouldn't it be better to raise her with someone else? Jeez, never mind that. I don't want to hurt Sun-woo. I won't get married again, even for Sun-woo's sake. Of course, Mr. Choi is a great person. Even back in Gimhae, he was well-known for being a good and kind person. That's why I want to do more good things for him. If you two keep talking like this, I won't ever set foot in his house again! All right, already. I still feel he could have been a good match. Sun-young... what about your own life? Yes, kids are important. You may think I'm just blabbing because I don't understand your situation. But you only live once. Right? Isn't that right? Just once, you should be happy. Don't you think so? I just want you to make the best of your life. You're so young. You're too young to pour everything you have into your kids alone. Those young days will fly by. I'm fine. If my kids are happy... Wow, this garlic is spicy. ...I'm happy. Well, that's all I need. I'm fine. Sun-young. The bear's here. Oh, hi there. -You're all here. -Yes. Have some garlic? Sun-young, you're going to the hospital with me tomorrow, right? Yes, of course. It's Mr. Choi's first physical since he was discharged, and he needs to get a prescription, and have a lot of exams. And the notice says someone has to come with him. And I decided to go as a representative of this neighborhood, right? Of course I should go, seeing as I'm the youngest of all of us. Would you prefer to go as the oldest? I don't think he'd like that. I should go, then. Don't you like Mr. Choi? I like him, but... I don't like him being close to my mom. Everyone is about that close in our neighborhood. It's not just the two of them. Even so, I don't like it. Don't think too much. It's not like he wants to marry your mom right away. Also, it was nice to see the two of them depending on each other. Well, I understand how you feel too. I understand how you feel. I think I'd feel the same way. What? At times like these, you act like an adult. You have a death wish? I'm not scared of your threats anymore. Want to meet for a bit tomorrow? I'll come to your school around dinnertime. Stop speaking so casually. -Everyone else does it. -You can't. Let's meet at the subway station near my school. Yes, ma'am. Are you upset? Yes. With that? When boyfriends get mad, girlfriends try to make them feel better and kiss them. Ouch, Bo-ra. Il-hwa, you're going to the hospital tomorrow, too. What time? Early tomorrow morning. Why? Are you sick? No. Mr. Sung's bank is giving them a full-body check-up. Wow, what a great workplace. They do that for you? It's not that good. What's so great about a workplace that pays so little? We only got it because he's been working there for 25 years. He worked so hard for 25 years, and this is what he got. But it's nice that he has a decent job. Is it your first full check-up? Yes. It's my first time. What if something turns out to be bad? Why are you worrying about useless things? To tell you the truth... I think I have a lump under my left breast. Since when? It's been a while. What if it's cancer? -Stop saying that. -Il-hwa. Don't jinx it. Stop saying such things. Many people have lumps in their breasts. I'm sure it's benign. Don't worry. So, are you going to the hospital alone tomorrow? Even the bear is going with his girlfriend. Enough, really. Sorry, it was a joke. Don't say that where Sun-woo will hear. Don't shock him. I won't. If you are scared, I'll go with you to the hospital. It's okay. My husband is taking the day off to come with me tomorrow. I'm such a scaredy-cat. That's good. It feels nice to have a husband at times like this, even though we fight all the time. Honey, go to sleep. It'll be hard on you to get all those exams tomorrow. If something's wrong... by any chance-- What could possibly be wrong? You're worrying for no reason. Stop worrying and go to sleep. If something's wrong with me, tell me everything. Don't hide it from me. All right, already. Now go to sleep. Okay! We got it! Okay! Did we lose power? I think so. Call and ask your dad to come home. -Wow. -Wow. This is why you need a man around the house. Is there anything else that needs fixing? All you did was switch a fuse. I could do that too. Even though it seems easy, it's very intricate and complex. That's why I was able to fix it. Are you worried about something? It's not about me. ll-hwa is getting a full-body check-up today. Will she be okay? She will be. She must be. She'll be fine, no matter what. Don't you worry one... bit. Enough is enough. I already feel cruddy. I like what I just did. There's nothing certain as of yet. So we have to do a biopsy to make sure? Yes, there's a point of concern on the x-ray, so we have to do a biopsy to be sure of anything. Can she get the biopsy right away? Yes, we'll give her a local anesthesia and do a biopsy. You'll be discharged in the evening. Doctor, could it possibly be cancer? What do you mean, cancer? Stop saying things like that! It's only natural for you to have a biopsy. Don't you worry. Just trust me. We don't know anything yet. We'll need to do the biopsy to know whether or not it's malignant. Don't worry too much. Please prepare for the biopsy. Ms. Lee Il-hwa? Please come out. -We have to get you changed. -Okay. Yeah, get ready. Doctor, what are the chances that it could be cancer? It's probably not cancer, right? To be honest, the shape doesn't look good, so I'm a bit worried. Even so, I can't know for sure. We'll have to wait for the results of the biopsy. I can't give you any answers right now. Yes, I see. Thank you, Doctor. Please take care of her. SSANGMUN GIRLS' HIGH Oh, yes. Let's mix everything. I'm excited. What about gochujang? Is this enough? Stop putting it in. -There we go. -Looks good. We don't have any good ingredients without Maggie. Poor thing, she must be so bored. She's been bedridden for two weeks. Is it really okay not to visit her? She said not to come, as her dad is really scary. I saw him on the street. He really looks scary. What kind of work does he do? You don't know either, right? She didn't seem to like talking about it, so I didn't bring it up. Soo-yeon. Do you think... he could be a thug-- I mean Mr. Thug? Or maybe part of the mob? Maybe that's why she told us not to visit her? You think so? No way. She goes traveling and eats out with him all the time. No way. -Right? -Yeah. No way. He looks really scary, though. Really? Don't move. You'll just get hurt. Be patient for one week. Dad, leave now. It's already nighttime. You have to open your store. Bo-ra. Let's go get dinner together. I have plans. Have fun, you two. Hey, you got a boyfriend, right? Hey, Sung Bo-ra, judging from your smile, you do have one. You're quite skilled, Sung Bo-ra. When did you find time? I know, right? I'm surprised too. Who is it? An upperclassman? A classmate? You don't need to know. -Come on, who is it? -Bo-ra. Who's that kid? Hello. -Oh, hey. -Hi. -Who are you? -He's my younger brother. Younger brother? I know what he looks like, he doesn't look this young. What's your relationship with Bo-ra? I mean he's a kid next door. My sister, Deok-sun's friend. What a great neighborhood. Neighborhood girl is buying you dinner. I guess there's a reason why Dooly landed in Ssangmun. Eat a lot of delicious things, okay? Punk, you're handsome. -We'll be going, Bo-ra. -Okay. Ask her to buy you a parfait. There's a famous place in Nokdugeori. Bye, Bo-ra! Okay. Finish that, at least. Okay. Oh, yeah, didn't you go to the hospital today? Yeah, I went. They said I'm fine. I'm good. Don't worry. I should have gone with you. I'm all better, anyway. I just got a prescription. I just have to get a checkup every two months. I'm fine, so do what you need to do. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm your son, and yet... What are you sorry about? I'm fine, so... Taek. Please, at least finish your rice. Yes. Hey, I'm sorry. Please eat. The fried tofu stew is really delicious. You're such a good person. You even buy dinner for a kid who lives next door. I'm sorry. I'm apologizing now, aren't I? I'm sorry, so please eat. Okay? Oh, my. Hey, look at me. I'm going to count to three. One. Two. Three. Eat now. Okay. Thanks, Bo-ra. -Casual tone again. I ought to... -Huh? I'm home. Soo-yeon's home, too. Mom, I'm home, too. Oh, you're here? All of you coming home at the same time? Mom, I'm hungry, feed me. You didn't eat yet? We had dinner early. It was such a long time ago. I want to eat too. Okay. I'll get it for you. Just wait. Here we go. Eat up. Mom, we only have cold rice? Yeah, I was busy today. I'm just going to eat ramen, then. How come? Eat this. You can mix it with the stew. Mom, just make ramen for me too. How can I eat cold rice so late? Mom, did you wash my button-up? I was going to wear it tomorrow. Oh, that. It got something on it, so I ran the washer. If I iron it tomorrow morning, you can wear it. No, you should have asked me before washing it! You freaking punks! What's wrong with this food? Mean kids. No-eul, you make your own hot rice! Deok-sun, you make your own damned ramen! Bo-ra, do your own damn laundry! Why does your mom have to do laundry for a grown-ass college student? You rotten kids. Oh, my. You terrible lot. Do you think that your mom will be with you forever? Don't you feel sorry for her? Be nice to her while she's still around. Grow up a little. You bastards... You're like enemies, not children. You're terrible. Eat! Honey! Did those two fight again? Why are they taking their anger out on us? Well... Bo-ra... let's have a chat. It's nothing serious, right? Of course not. Your mother is getting a biopsy just in case. I'm sure it'll all be fine. Don't even worry a little. You're the eldest daughter, so I thought you should know. That's why I'm telling you. Don't tell your younger siblings. Just keep it to yourself. Okay. And... if you're having a hard time lately-- I'm going to sleep. Okay, go to sleep early. Can I have some seasoned cartilage and odeng for 300 won? It's for my wife. Hey. Have a seat. Let's have a drink. It'll be fine. I'm sure it's nothing. Yes, don't you worry. -Right? -Of course. My younger sister had a biopsy on her chest, but the lump was just a water pocket. Don't worry. When will you find out? This Saturday. I was so anxious that they said they'd get me my results faster. They're going to call me. But... do you really think it's nothing? Of course. You're such a worrywart. Okay. I can't help how I feel. Why are you coming out from there? She was sitting in her room all day, so I brought her over for some coffee. Thank you so much. Stop frowning. It's really nothing. I'm not worried in the slightest. Let's have some goldfish bread together at home. Hello, President Sung! Hello, President Kim. -It's so nice to see you. -It's so nice to see you. Why are you coming from there? The light went out, so I fixed it. Do you hear this? The filament is all worn out. I fixed it, so the light should be nice and bright. All right. What's so amazing about having changed a light bulb? My No-eul could do that with both his eyes closed. Honey, do you know what happened yesterday? Dong-il said-- Wow, you're so incredibly talented. Edison invented it, but I'll bet he didn't know how to change one. You even look so skilled, really. Not just anyone can run a GoldStar store. I'm cold, so I'll be going inside now. -Okay. -Yeah, get inside. She's really okay, right? I'm worried. Well... that is... Of course not. There's nothing to worry about. I asked the doctor about it while she was getting examined. He told me that those with lumps and many other people get biopsies. I'm not worried at all. Not even a tiny bit! I'm not. Here's the morning news  for Saturday, February 25th. The Fujitsu Tournament in Japan will take place tomorrow. The grand prize for Fujitsu is 15 million yen. In Korean currency, that's 70 million won. Choi Taek, 6-dan, of Korea, who unfortunately only got second place last year, will compete in the final. He will be heading toward Japan through Gimpo Airport today. He's said to be quite calm, just as usual. Next story. All high schools in Seoul will be starting their spring break today. Most schools are planning to begin the new school year on March second. -Taek hasn't left, right? -Hey. Here, give Taek this before he goes. It's easier to digest than rice. That's good. Thanks. Bye. Okay. -I'm going to the study room. -Okay. Spring break starts today. No need to iron that. I want to iron it in advance. Okay. Oh, yeah. Taek is going to Japan tomorrow, right? Is it a big match? It's called Fujitsu. Taek was the runner-up twice. I'll be going now. Okay, bye. Why isn't this working? Honey! Yes, Madam? What can I do for you? This iron is broken. Yeah? The cord is disconnected. Give it here. I'll fix it right away. How can you fix this? Just call someone. Call someone? Because of this lousy thing? Give me an hour. I'll fix it right away. I have a bad feeling. Mr. Lee is here. He's waiting outside. Okay. Taek, where did you say your hotel was? Leave me the hotel's number. Just a moment. GO-GAME JOURNAL TOKYO GARDEN HOTEL Put this away. We might need it again later. Okay. Hello. Hello. I've parked the car down there. We'll be late for the plane. Let's go. -Please take good care of him. -Yes, give them to me. Mr. Lee, just a moment. Did you sleep well? That's good. Are you leaving now? Yeah. Aren't you cold? Nope. Aren't you cold? Me? A little. Zip your jacket, you dunce. Get me a souvenir. What do you want? -Are you really going to buy me something? -Yeah. It's fine, there's no way you'll remember. I'm serious. I'll bring something this time. Never mind that. Just get me anything you get from the tournament. They gave you keychains and towels last time for participating. You'll be late. Hurry and go. Okay. I'm off. You little... Deok-sun. It's okay if I lose, right? Bye. Honey, come on. Get up and have some of this. I can't get it down. Come on, have some. Get up. Please. You haven't had breakfast or lunch. You'll really die, really. Don't be like that and have some of this. What about the kids? I'm sure they'll take care of stuffing their own faces. Honey. Why haven't they called? They said they'd call this afternoon. Hey, it's 2:00 p.m. now. They will call in the afternoon, as they said. I'm sure they have tons of people to call. That's what it is. So just wait a bit longer and don't worry. Also, just stay put. There won't be anything wrong with you. Just trust me. Are you a doctor? What good would it do to trust you? That's how it seemed when I was there. I'm sure you're really scared. But judging from how the doctor and nurse seemed that day, it didn't seem serious at all. So, don't worry. Eat up. Are you done yet? Hold on. You cut the cord? How can I use this now? You're supposed to cut it to connect it back together. Ms. Zebra, don't worry and go watch TV. Where did the kids go? I don't see them anywhere. First, take four million won each. Banking is important. It's not easy. Can I be the banker while I play? Dong-ryong, do you know why I am still studying to go to college? It's because of this game. I'm not really good at Monopoly. No problem. I'll tell you everything. Ten. A deserted island. You lose the next three turns. Next. I don't know about Taipei. A house will only pay out 10,000 won. I'm not sure it's worth investing in. Twelve. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... Seoul, you can't build there, but landing there is two million won. Golden Key, you got it again, No-eul. Please pick a card. Hey, you said you weren't good. Why are you so good? Everything is yours. Everyone has at least one talent. Flip over a card. {\an8}SPACE ADVENTURE INVITATION -Damn it. -Really? Soo-yeon, what does this card do? Real beginner's luck. How come you always get all these great cards? It pisses me off. You don't even know that? We told you in the beginning. Soo-yeon. There is a saying; Bool-chi-ha-moon. It means, "Don't be ashamed to ask about something to someone beneath you." Are you implying that I'm beneath him? Being in 999th place and 1000th place are just about the same. You're last place, though. Please be quiet. Jung-bong, what kind of card is this? It's the best card in the game. With this card, you can go anywhere you want. No way. It's also my favorite card. No-eul, where do you want to go? Say it. Oh, yeah. Let's split up here. I have to hurry home. Did something happen? No... I just have to study. Bye. I'm home. You're home, Bo-ra? I must be out of it. I should be preparing dinner. No, let's just order in. I want to eat jjajangmyun. Yeah, let's order in. Call Deok-sun, I mean Soo-yeon, and No-eul. Okay, let's do that, then. Did they call yet? Go inside. Stop. Give it here. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Mi-ran. You should've said you couldn't do it. How the hell am I supposed to use this? We could have just got it serviced! It's really difficult to fix that. Not just anyone can do it. I got this far, because I was good. How can I use this now? Put it down and talk, okay? -Damn it! -Oh, okay. See you all tomorrow. Mister, please leave the Monopoly there. Okay. Well, Soo-yeon. Yeah, what is it? About your friend... Maggie? It'll be a long time before she is discharged. I'd like to visit her at the hospital. What does she like? I want to bring her a gift. What should I get? She's rich, she has everything. Still. Well. -Flowers? -Her room is flooded with them. -Cake? -She doesn't like it. What Maggie wants the most now... is to go outside. She's been cooped up in that hospital room for two weeks now. We want to go hang out with her, but her dad is super scary. When she gets discharged, I'll help you out. Just trust me. Bye! Okay, Jin-ju. Wait a bit longer. Okay. Here. Ta-da! Sun-young. It's all finished. Already? Wow! You've got some skills. Jin-ju. Jin-ju, you can watch cartoons now. Jin-ju must be so happy. I'll go now. Jin-ju. Oh, boy, I have to go. What do I do? I have to go, though... Are you having fun? Moo-sung, have dinner here. If you leave now, she'll cry all night. Should I, then? Okay. I'll eat dinner before I go. Jin-ju, say ah. Is that good? Give that here. Mom, I'm... Oh, you're back, Sun-woo? Come, let's eat. Okay. Hello. Oh, hey. There. Well, the VCR broke, so... I came to fix the VCR player, so that Jin-ju can watch a cartoon. She's stuck to me like glue. Jin-ju, do you like him that much? Mom, can I have rice? Oh, yes. I want that. Here. Oh, my. Did Il-hwa's results come out yet? The sun's almost setting. I'm going to Jung-bong's. I'm meeting Joey, too. Mom, are you done? I'm good. I don't like jjajangmyun. You should eat some more. I don't really like this either. Don't worry. I'll bring you the best one from my store tomorrow. I'm not worried about that damn iron! Then, what? Il-hwa's biopsy result is supposed to come out today, but I haven't heard from her. She said she'd call as soon as she finds out. Hello? Yes, that's me. I'm Lee Il-hwa. Yes, go ahead. Are the results out? Are they not good? Oh, I see. Yes. Yes. Then it's nothing, right? Yes, I understand. Yes, I will. Yes. Thank you. Bye. I told you that it was nothing. It was a water pocket. They said I just have to get... what was it? Oh, yeah, a followup test once a year. What did I tell you? I told you it wasn't cancer and that there was nothing to worry about. Why would I have worried? Seriously, I didn't worry even a tiny bit. Really? I thought that you might have been a tiny bit uneasy. Wow, my husband Sung Dong-il is truly a man. I wasn't worried for even a second from the beginning. Really. Why would I worry about nothing? I wasn't worried at all. All right. Il-hwa. Judging from your look, your results came out. It was nothing, right? They said it was a water pocket. Thank goodness. You were so worried about it, so I was getting a bit worried. Wow, congratulations. Yes, thank you. Dong-il, you must have been worried too. You can rest easy now. What do you mean? I wasn't worried for even a second from the beginning. I was fine. Oh, why not have a drink tonight to celebrate? Thank you for the meal. -Oh, okay. -Head inside, then. We have rice wine and dried pollack. Let's have that. Wait, no. Wild ginseng liquor. Let's open that up. Wild ginseng liquor? Do they have that? Wow, you are asking something big. He values that more than his own life. He will never open that. On a chilly day like this, warm rice wine is just the right drink. Il-hwa. Did you know-- Let's open the wild ginseng liquor. Upstairs or downstairs? I meant we must decide where. Where should we open it? So we're opening it? Where should we? Where? Doesn't matter, it's wild ginseng liquor. -Come in. -No, it's okay. Moo-sung, have you heard that? What? You know that thief from before? The owner of the ice store said the thief had a knife. Really? He didn't get hurt? -He did. -What? His arm was scratched up a bit. He could have gotten seriously hurt. Moo-sung, aren't you scared? I am. Excuse me. A person was stabbed. I heard. I am scared. I'm just wasting my breath. Just wasting. Oh, it's a plane. Where? Breaking news. A Korean plane headed from Gimpo to Tokyo with 182 passengers swerved off course of Narita airport, in Japan. The Foreign Ministry is checking the list of Korean passengers. There are no specific numbers of casualties or injuries. According to the latest information, it seems that Choi Taek, 6-dan, and his entourage who were headed to the Fujitsu Tournament, were on board. As the list has not been confirmed, finding specifics will take some time. Based on our current information, however, we are almost certain Choi Taek, 6-dan, was on board. Oh, my God! What do we do? Mister! Have you gotten any calls from Taek? When was his flight? You know his hotel's number? I wrote it down. What should we do? Wait. Oh, wait, hold on. Call the Go-game club! The club! I will call. Wait, Taek put the contact info in his journal this morning. Is this wild ginseng liquor? Are you messing with me? Where's the wild ginseng? There it is, floating in the middle. It's been alive like that for 20 years because it's a real one. It is a real wild ginseng, though. He secretly snatched one part from his branch manager. Due to the bad weather, a plane from Gimpo  swerved off course on its way  to Narita Airport in Japan. Oh, my. The passenger list has not been released yet. However, according to the airport, Choi Taek, 6-dan, -and his entourage were on board. -What the hell is this? -Japan is also reporting this... -Oh, my God! Oh, my! Everyone, please go back home. The situation has been taken care of. What do you mean? Is Taek okay? Did they talk to him? Yes, he's fine. He's at the hotel now. Mr. Choi is speaking with Taek now. I felt my heart drop. I still feel uneasy. Is Mr. Choi okay? He must have been shocked. Who, him? I've seriously never seen such a collected guy in my life. Amazing. Head back home. I heard it's raining a lot there. I see. Take care of yourself. Make sure to eat well. Mi-ran, are you okay? -Oh, my. -Mother. No matter how much I think about it, he isn't normal. Yeah, I agree. He's not human. He's a bear with no hair. Don't worry about me. Go to sleep early tonight, okay? Don't take too many pain relievers. Yeah. Okay. Make sure you pack an umbrella in the morning. Okay. Okay, good night. Okay. Did you go somewhere? Watch. Concerning the deceased, a full list has not come in. According to most recent news, Korean player Choi Taek had planned to participate… Is that me? People have been freaking out because of that news. The lobby is full of reporters and government officials asking if you're all right. The correction news will be aired. Oh, yeah, did you speak with your father? Yes, a little while ago. He seemed to be completely fine. He stays calm under any circumstances. Are you kidding me? I mean, he thought his child was hurt. How could he be so unflappable? I think Taek takes after his father. He's like a stone Buddha. But even so, it's only natural for a parent's heart to break when kids so much as fall down. No matter how much I think about it, I don't get it. Man, what a bear. Come in to drink. -Are you kidding me? -Excuse me? It's the first time I've seen your father upset like that. I thought he was going to blow out my eardrum. Mr. Lee? One second. Okay. Rest. -Hello? -Choi Taek? Yes. I had to hear your voice to make sure. Oh yeah, I'm fine. Why didn't you pick up the phone? When? You called me before? The whole time. Your dad kept crying because of you. It was serious here. Taek. I thought your dad was Superman today. What do you mean? I don't know where he got the strength. I said, what do you mean? Oh, no. Here. I'll do it. It was a brown one. That one. Sun-woo, my hands are shaking so much. Can you call? I can't do anything. Okay. Oh, my. CHOI TAEK He's not picking up. Oh, my God! Moo-sung, he'll be okay. Oh, my. Hello? Hello? We're calling from Korea. Who is it? Is Taek there? We're his family. Is Taek in the room? He's taking a shower right now. Is that true? But, what is... Where is Taek? Where is he? Is this Taek's father? Is Taek in the hotel room right now? Is he in the hotel room? He really is there, right? Yes, sir. He's taking a shower right now. I saw him go in with my own two eyes. But, why are you... He's there? Yes? Hello. The news said Taek was in an accident. Excuse me? An accident? Mr. Lee, there's big trouble because of the media. -Please come down, quickly. -Okay. Yes, I understand. Hello? Dad. Something happened? I heard it's raining a lot there. Yes, it is. The weather isn't good. I see. Take care of yourself. -Make sure to eat well. -Okay. Make sure you pack an umbrella in the morning. Okay. Good night. Way to go. You sure kept calm, didn't you? Taek, be good to your dad. It really seems like you're everything to him. Good night. Hey, it's okay if you lose. Bye. Mr. Choi, let's go have a drink. Let's have some soju. Speaking of which, you must have been really shocked. Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. Jeez, he's beyond human. It's not like my fussing will fix the situation. Wow, you're a true man. If it were Dong-il over here, he would've been crying up a storm. What? It's just us men here. What's so embarrassing about crying? Can't men cry a little too? You cried? Did something happen? No. Damn you. He did. When Il-hwa got her full-body checkup, she had to get a biopsy too. He latched onto me as I was heading home and cried up a storm. Do you know? My poor Il-hwa. I feel so sorry. She had to meet a rotten husband like me and suffer so much. What if she gets sick? What do I do? My poor Il-hwa. What do I do? My poor Il-hwa! I can't live without her. My Il-hwa! Il-hwa! No. A biopsy doesn't mean much, right? I'm sure everything will be just fine. But what if, just what if, she has a disease or something? Say something! It'll be fine. I'm sure it's nothing. What? -You're saying that because it's not you. -No. It'll be fine? You're just saying that. My poor Il-hwa. What would I do? I can't live without her! If she dies, I'll die with her! I'll just die, too! But when the doctor said "biopsy," he was definitely smiling. But what if Il-hwa is ill? How could I raise three kids all alone? I can raise them just fine without her. No! Who cares about the kids when I won't have Il-hwa? Everyone around us watched him. It was embarrassing. What's so manly about you then? You didn't know how to fix an iron, so you cut the entire wire up. Who said that? There are no secrets in this neighborhood. What kind of a man can't fix an iron and chops it all up? Anyway, there's only one true man in our neighborhood, Mr. Choi over here. Now bottoms up. Was your personality always like that? Even when you were young? They say, "Mool-ryung-mang-dong, Jung-joong-yuh-san." Moo... yeah? What does that mean? It's what General Yi Sun-sin said to a soldier quaking in fear, before the Japanese invasion in 1592. It means, "Don't act thoughtlessly. A real man should conduct himself calmly with prudence like a grand mountain." Oh, my God, a mouse! Why is she making such a fuss about one small mouse? -What are you doing? -There it is! Where? -Over here. -Oh, my God. It's gone now. She said it's gone. Come back. You're a big man. What's wrong with you? It's not that I was scared. I'm fine with literally everything else, but mice are really... Jeez. -Oh, my God, a mouse! -Where? Wow, seriously. I'm telling you in case you misunderstand. Honestly, I'm not scared. It's just because I was bitten by a mouse when I was six years old. So I got a disease sort of thing. Was the mouse that big? It was about the size of a Jindo dog. But it bit my Achilles tendon very hard, and I developed a trauma. -Oh. -When I served the military, I was able to dominate a cow-sized wild dog in the patrolling area just by looking at it. When I was young, Superman lived at my house. He was a MacGyver-type of guy who could fix everything in the world. Wow. Wow. -Thumbs up! -Thumbs up! Is the blow dryer broken? Give it here. I'll fix it. He was the superhero who appeared out of nowhere to help people and fix every sort of problem. And he was a real hero who'd never show any sort of weakness whatsoever. -Bye, Mister. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye. Let's go. However, I came to know the truth after growing up. They were all normal people whose true selves were still hidden. Mi-ran, I'm almost done fixing it. I can really fix it. Give me one chance. I'm almost done fixing it! Nobody knows what kinds of dirty, unfair, sad, scary, difficult things that fathers were forced to face throughout their lifetimes. And now I realized it. The reason why they endured through the dirty, unfair, sad, scary, difficult times, is because they had people they had to protect. It's because they have families and me. They had to live as fathers. CHOI TAEK, 6-DAN, WINS THE FUJITSU MATCH Taek is so amazing. He won the Fujitsu match. And the prize money was 70 million won. Wow. What's that? I don't know. Taek gave it to me. What? Where did he get it? I'm going to die of frustration. He's an idiot. Who says that? You don't want to live, do you? I asked him to bring me anything from the competition and he brought that. Bringing that must've been a hassle. So frustrating. That stupid idiot. Soo-yeon, hand me that pot for green onion kimchi. Okay. You can't! Stop! That would be crazy. What? CHOI TAEK, 6-DAN, HOLDS THE VICTOR'S CUP Where did Jung-bong go? He got dressed and left this morning. Where? HANKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL TO: MS. JANG MI-OK JANG MI-OK HANKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL Excuse me. Give it to me. I'll give it to her. He was standing in front of your room all day. It was so frustrating, so I told him I'd give it to you instead. I'll keep this a secret from your father. Thank you. SPACE ADVENTURE INVITATION You know nothing about men, do you? No way. -Jung-hwan. -Yeah? {\an8}Happy birthday. {\an8}I need to talk to Mom and Dad. {\an8}I have faith in Bo-ra. {\an8}Bo-ra, there's really nothing going on as of now, right? {\an8}-Why do I feel so uneasy? -What about? {\an8}I hate this. I really hate this. {\an8}It's okay, don't worry. Don't cry. {\an8}I feel so bad... {\an8}Deok-sun. {\an8}Why Deok-sun? {\an8}I just like her. {\an8}Why isn't there anyone who likes me? {\an8}I guess I'm not worthy of love. {\an8}I guess I was wrong again. {\an8}Do you like Jung-hwan or Taek better? {\an8}There's someone I like. {\an8}I'm going to confess to her... soon. {\an8}Subtitle translation by Stefanie Elalouf
