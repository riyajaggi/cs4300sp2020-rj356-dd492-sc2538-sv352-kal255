 Why are you picking on me? Okay! I'll stop! Mi-ran! Are you throwing that away? Don't. We can use that for another ten years. Mom or Dad? Choose. What? We'll get divorced because of this iron. -Who will you live with? -Dad. I choose you, Mother. I'll go with you. Yes! Dad, I'll deliver it. Yeah?

 I'll go to Sun-woo's house. So just go to Jung-hwan's and Soo-yeon's houses. Okay. Oh, and Dong-ryong's house too. There's no need to deliver. I came personally to spare you the trouble. How did you know? Taek, God is fair. He gave you the talent for Go-game. But I was given amazing hearing, telling apart the sounds of Jung-hwan's dad's car, Bo-ra's car, and the car you ride in. I was studying in my room, and I heard your car from afar. I heard a rustle! I figured that you received an expensive fruit basket, and that some fruit will be delivered to our house-- Your dad is waiting. Hurry up and go home. He's on night duty today, so he's not home. Thank you for the fruit. Taek, you know Jung-hwan's birthday is this weekend, right? Happy birthday to you! Bye. What should I take? Give each family one of these plastic bags. What about these bananas? Oh. I'm giving them to Jin-ju. She likes bananas. Is it okay if I take one? Of course you can. You brought them. Hello! Hello, President Choi! Hello! Hey, you should say, "Hello, President Kim!" How? I don't know how. Okay, raise your arm up next to your ear. Say, "hello"-- Hi, Taek. What is this? It's fruit. My dad wants you to have it. Tell him I said thank you! There are oranges, right? Yes, I saw them in there. Jung-hwan, Taek is here! Taek, eat with us. -Hey, what's up? -Hey. Thank you, but I have to go to Deok-sun's house. I have to go. Goodbye. See you on your birthday. Do you have time? Yes, I do. See you then. It's good to have friends. He makes time for your birthday, even when he has no time to sleep. -Is it that good? -Yes. Deok-sun. Deok-sun. It's Soo-yeon, you dummy! Soo-yeon, can you come out? Just come inside. It's cold. Hurry. Oh, yeah! Oh, my gosh, a banana! No way! No way! Your pronunciation has gotten much better! No socks? Goodness, I can't believe you! Is everyone gone? Yeah. My mom went to the market. My dad and No-eul went to meet friends. Bo-ra left for the library at dawn. She must be possessed by a ghost who didn't study. She is studying so hard. Bo-ra must have been you in her past life. Do you want to die? Only learn what's good for you. Want some? No, you eat it. You didn't sleep last night. Is it obvious? Very. No sleeping pill? You told me not to, so I didn't. Good job. What about headache medicine? Just one. Good job, Taek. Hi, Taek! You're here! No match today? Taek, would you mind signing ten autographs? My teacher asked me. Okay. Your freshman teacher or junior teacher? Oh, where did you get a banana? Did you bring this? Thank you. The freshman teacher, of course. I don't know who my junior-year teacher is yet. I find out tomorrow. Where's Bo-ra? Library again? I don't know. It's a part-time job. I don't know why she's working so hard. She's really invested in it. Your skin is so dry! Put on some lotion! How do you age faster than Dad? It's okay. A face like mine looks younger later. Seriously, this is too much. It's Sunday. Have fun on days like these. I can't. I start work next week. -I don't want to look like an idiot. -Silly. What are you doing? Let's go. Your hand is really warm. What did you do to it? What do you mean? It's always been warm. Bo-ra, I'll see you at the food tent tonight. I have to study. Bo-ra. Okay, I'll be there. Jin-ju, eat slowly. No one is going to snatch it away. Where's Sun-woo? Did he go to the study room? He went out to meet someone. Moo-sung, I need you to watch Jin-ju when the kids go back to school tomorrow. I decided to work at the bath house again. Don't worry about Jin-ju. Sun-young. Sun-woo knows. What? Sun-woo knows that you're working. How? How did he find out? Well, he just found out somehow. Don't worry. Sun-woo is understanding. Mom. -Hello, Mr. Choi. -Hi. You're back! Eat some of this fruit. Mr. Choi brought it. Wow, bananas! Eat all you want, Jin-ju! Okay. Taek must have returned. Yes, he got back last night. He doesn't bring home gifts, but he never fails to bring fruit back with him. Jin-ju, isn't it yummy? She's excited. No. Why not? You should use glue for the wings. Here. Really? Isn't it the same thing? Rice glue falls off once it dries. The liquid glue makes it strong. Don't forget to roll up the rubber too. Got it? Yes. I'll win it all with this. Sun-woo, dinner is ready! Come out! Okay. Soo-yeon, set the table. Okay. Where's Dad? It's time for him to come. I wonder who he's meeting with for so long. Mom, Dad isn't lending money to his friends, right? We don't have any money to lend. Don't worry. Stop talking nonsense and eat your food. Bastard. Really? These shoes are really for me? TIGER I said I'd buy you new sneakers when you become a senior. Then, can I throw away my old pair? Sure, you've worn them long enough. I'll burn those raggedy shoes! Yes! They're not Nike or Adidas. Do you still like them that much? Tiger is fine! Except for Maggie, many classmates wear these. What about me? My sneakers are worn out too. I'll buy you a pair next year, when you become a senior. Okay? Oh, my. Don't look so sad. You have Tiger. Mom, I want new sneakers too! The soles are all torn up. They get soaked when it rains. No-eul, she said next year. Yeah. If you rank 100th or above at school, I'll buy you a pair, okay? 100th or above? Forget it. Just say you don't want to buy them. That's impossible. No-eul, don't look so sad, I have Tiger. I'm so excited. Why isn't Dad coming home? He didn't eat dinner. Hi, Wife! It's cold. Why are you outside? Oh, my. You've been waiting for your husband. Do you know how late it is? What took you so long? Did you have a date with your girlfriend? Honey, I already broke up with her. You bought meat? You're driving me crazy. We don't have money for meat. We have no money left for this month. Hong-shik bought this meat. Hong-shik... Hong-shik? You met with that punk? That's the person you met today? Goodness, I guess he wasn't dead after all. How dare he show his face after he turned our family into this mess? Where is he? I'm going to catch him and hand him over to the police. Where is he? Let's go! Honey... it's all over. It's over. Hong-shik paid off the debt. He went to the bank, and paid off the whole debt. He said he was too sorry to talk to you, saying what he did was unforgivable. He said if he can't pay us back while he's alive, he'll pay it all back when he's dead. You've been through a lot. You've suffered so much. Even though we can't live in luxury, I will get my whole regular paycheck from now on. Now, you don't ever need to borrow and pay back 10,000 won here and there. You won't have to ask for favors anymore. Thank you for everything. I was so sorry. I'm not the one who suffered. It was our children who suffered. Sun-woo. You know... I was only going to work until the end of the month and then quit. I was bored staying at home. It's not because of money. Jin-ju has grown up a lot and it felt stuffy staying home. I'm not going to work anymore, so don't worry. It's okay, Mom. I'm okay with it. You can keep working. But, if it's hard, if your wrists hurt, quit immediately. Okay? KOREAN LANGUAGE SUNG DEOK-SUN All done. Hey! Don't touch it. It'll get smudged. It's been a while since I've shown what I got. Oh, Dad, you're awesome. Write it for me too. Sure, bring your book. I'll do it nicely. Way to go. You made a cover on your first day of school. Mind your own business. Breakfast is ready. Clear the area. Okay. Let's eat. Let's stuff our faces. Mom, what's wrong? Are we broke? Are we totally bankrupt now? Do we have to run away after we eat all of this? Run away? Stop the nonsense. Honey, are you that happy? Yes, I'm happy. I couldn't sleep a wink last night. What? Really? Yes, really. Your dad will bring home his regular paycheck from now on. The debt is paid off? Dad's paycheck won't be withheld anymore? Yes, it's over now. It's all over! Are we going to be rich now? Not to that extent. We can live like other people now. Dad, buy me a new pair of sneakers! Dad, I need allowance to buy a birthday gift for Jung-hwan. Okay. Here. This is for No-eul. Buy yourself a new pair of sneakers. Can I really buy a pair of Nikes? Buy Nike. Buy whatever you want. Yes! Nike! Dad, me too! I need spending money, too! Okay. This is for Deok-sun, I mean Soo-yeon. All right! Dad, I love you! I love you, Dad! Geez. What about you, Bo-ra? Is there anything you want? I'm good. Bo-ra, you're all grown up. Well, she is the oldest after all. She's very considerate. By the way, Bo-ra, I have something else set aside for you. What are they saying? Can you hear? I can't hear. Maybe Dad is giving her 100,000 won? I won't stand for it. Be quiet, Soo-yeon. Isn't your school starting uniforms this year? Only for freshmen. That's a waste of money to only wear them for a year. What are they saying? Still can't hear? I can't hear anything. I think it's pretty serious. SSANGMUN GIRLS' HIGH Hey, girls. Hey! Come here quickly. What's up with the atmosphere? We are seniors now. Dang it. Big Ji-young and Little Ji-young are both in our class? Yes. So are Fat Mi-yeon and Skinny Mi-yeon. How long has the sloth been sleeping? I don't know. She was sleeping when I got here. The rumors are true. She does sleep a lot. That's where she got her nickname. Is the class president here? She came a while ago. Hey, she's been studying math since early this morning. She left to wash her face. She's so annoying. She will annoy you. Why are we sitting like this? Can't we sit wherever we want? I miss Maggie. She'll come later for lunch. The boys in my neighborhood are all in the same class. The rumor is that we got the same homeroom teacher-- SSANGMUN HIGH They're so pretty. Stop shaking your leg. What's up with this punk? Do you have any lead for a mechanical pencil? No. What about you? No, I don't use it. Did you hear about our homeroom teacher? He'll be here soon. Who is it? This can't be happening. Seriously. Why? Who is it? No way. Come on. No way. Dong-ryong's father? Good morning, my precious bastards! You are all so dead now. What are you going to do now? Are you okay? Who is that? Who fainted? It's Dong-ryong. Is that so? Just let him be, then. It's all an act. Cover him with his jacket. The floor is quite cold, so leave him there. That rascal. Okay, I'll introduce myself. My name is... Ryu Jae-myeong. We know! Starting today, I will be your homeroom teacher. Nice to meet you all! You rascals! Look how excited all of you are! That's enough. Night sessions start today. Don't run off. Not even once. You'll see hell. Got it? -Yes! -Understood? Yes! That's it for morning announcements. Sun-woo is the class president for now. Attention. -Bow. -Thank you! Poor Dong-ryong. Are you crying? -He's crying. -Really? Shouldn't we wake her up? Hey, wake up and eat. Princess Nam, wake up! It's lunch time. I'm going to sleep, don't wake me up. I ate earlier. Sure, go to sleep. Let's eat together. Okay. Your family is pretty well off! I'm going to eat one. Teach me some math later on, at the night session. Okay? If I have time. Hey! Fine. You have Bo-ra. Why worry? She goes to Seoul National University. I'd rather fail than learn from her. And she's really busy these days. Once she starts, she studies like crazy. It's annoying. -Here. -I'm good. How can you eat that right after lunch? What's with you? Did you hit your head? When have you ever not eaten this? You're crazy for fried toast. Joey bought it because of you. I'm on a diet. -Why? -Have you lost your mind? I have a date on Saturday. For real? No way! Wow, you did it! Are you seeing Jung-bong? Yeah, I got a letter asking to meet him on Saturday. No way! For real? Where? At 7:00 p.m. at Jongno Banjul. -No way! -Wow. Are you going to meet up and eat steak? Soo-yeon, you better play dumb. Don't act like you know. It's embarrassing. How can I play dumb, living in the same house? Still, act like you don't know. What if it doesn't work out? All right, I'll try. Maggie, pow! Where are you going, at this hour? To my room. Hello, President Sung! Hello, President Kim! -It's good to see you! -It's good to see you! Soo-yeon, did you come to see me? No, not you. I came to see Jung-bong. Why? Is there something going on? What? A date? With your friend? You've got to be kidding me. Which friend? You mean those ugly girls? Better than your friends! My brother has to go to college. My friend has to go to college too. Ah, right. Will we celebrate your birthday tomorrow in Taek's room? Is it tomorrow? You don't know your own birthday? Forget about it. No need to celebrate. Taek has a match the next day. Celebrate another time. No, we'll do it. Your mom said she'll order sweet and sour pork. Where are they meeting? Jongno Banjul. -The coffee shop? -Isn't that a restaurant? On the first floor, it's a cafe. What are you saying? Floors two through four are restaurants. How pretty! My goodness, do you like it that much? I got a call from your husband, and I picked the best one in our shop. I even sold it to him for half price. Turn it on. Okay. I'm going to trash that old range. What? Give it to me then. Geez! You're going to hell. Yes, 150,000 won. She bought it for 150,000 won. They're such swindlers. They'll do anything for money! I'm so annoyed! I see. That makes me feel better. You're right. I will think that way. All right, I won't make a fuss about it to Mom. Okay. Good night. My goodness. It's so late! Jin-ju, time to wash up and get ready for bed. Get up now. INTERSECTION A AND B A AND B = B AND A I'm sure they met up. Of course they did. It's too late already. She would have called me if they didn't. I have a bad feeling about this. It'll only take ten minutes. I'll see you at the food tent. I have something for you. Okay. What is it? You'll see. To me, it's the most precious thing. What is it? Okay, I'm leaving right now. What would we have done if phones didn't exist? I know. I wonder, how people ever dated without phones? They probably wrote letters. They all seem to live happily ever after anyway. It must've been very inconvenient. Bo-ra, I'll leave now, too. I'll give it to her. It's okay, right? Sure. It's been several years. It's okay. Do you like Bo-ra that much? Jung-hwan. Jung-bong didn't come back, right? He must be with her, then. Have you called your friend? Her dad is so scary that I've never called her house. She said she would call me once their date ended. Go inside, it's cold. I'll call you when he comes. Okay. See you tomorrow. Yeah. It's for me! Here. Hello? Mi-ok? What do you mean, Jung-bong? Still haven't seen her? It's so late! Hello, I apologize for calling so late. I'm Sung Soo-yeon, Mi-ok's friend. May I speak to Mi-ok? It's really urgent. Why are you at home? Deok-sun, I got stood up. Oh, please! Jung-bong is still there, waiting for you! What? He's still waiting for you at Banjul! What were you two doing? Oh, no! Deok-sun, what should I do? What do you think? Get over there! You're insane! Get going! Jongno Banjul, please. Banjul? I think they're closed now. I know, please hurry. Am I wrong? Is the coffee shop on the first floor still open? The restaurant on the second floor must be closed by now. He's not feeling well. You guys are driving me nuts. Jung-bong wore a coat that he never wears and bought flowers. I didn't tell you as I didn't want to spoil the surprise. You two are pathetic! Hurry. He can't catch a cold. He has a health condition. Geez. How long have you been here? It hasn't been too long. I just got here. Oh, well... Here. You must be cold. Why don't we go somewhere and eat some hot... Late winter of 1989. My heart is racing. I wanted to know if that was because of my illness or because of her. I'll find out! She's doing that so you don't worry. Don't get upset over that. Still, she used to tell me everything. Lately, she talks to Mr. Choi more. About my grandma today, too. We would stay up all night bad mouthing the swindler. Why do you dislike Mr. Choi? Me? I don't dislike him. I mean it! I don't dislike him. I'm just... not happy about the situation. I don't dislike him. You said you had something for me. Right. Let's leave. Someone else might come. Give it to me here. What is it? No, what if our dads come again? Let's go. Now. Come on, let's go. Hey. I don't wear necklaces. You know that. You don't have to wear it. Just keep it, I'm giving it to you. Your dad gave this to you before he passed away. It's just a necklace. Don't feel burdened. This is not just a necklace. I do feel burdened. Soo-yeon, the guys want you to hurry up. The party is about to start. No-eul, which look suits me the least, when I dress up? Be honest. I'll do everything except that. You look the worst when you're dressed up. You said to be honest! I'm such an idiot for asking you! You ought to... Where's the gift? You said you bought him a gift. I already gave it to him! -Jung-hwan. -Yeah? Happy birthday! Thank you. What is this shirt? Did you buy it? Oh, yeah. It's pink. It's my favorite color. I'm leaving. -We're meeting up at Taek's room. -Okay. Happy birthday again. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Jung-hwan Happy birthday to you It wouldn't have hurt you to wrap up a birthday present. How are we supposed to wrap that? We worked hard to buy that. Yeah, we thought long and hard. We had no money, but we saved every cent. So we ate a piece of fish cake each, and bought it with Taek's money. Thanks, Taek. No, they pitched in too. I'm really touched by Master Choi. Truly. Your personality is perfect, and you perfectly suck at chopsticks. -Who lost Go-games to you? -Taek, stop. Turn on Top Gun. I want to see Tom Cruise. Jung-hwan and I already saw this twice. Let's watch something else. I haven't seen it. -Me neither. -Me neither. Jung-hwan, can't we watch this? You can, go ahead. Soo-yeon, if it weren't for you, we wouldn't be watching a PG movie, Why? Let's watch it together. I'm okay with it. We're not okay with it. Choi Taek, you like movies like that, too? No, I don't like them. I ought to... You taught him? Didn't you? Of all the things to teach him, this is what you choose? I didn't teach him anything! Excuse me! What do you know about Taek? What don't I know? I know everything about him! You corrupted an innocent kid! Taek, I-- Taek, I want to write down the name of the hotel we're staying at tomorrow. I need the business card. Sure. Here, Dad. We have to leave now, don't we? Yeah, it's getting dark. You're leaving now? Taek has a match tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. in Busan. You should've left in the daytime! It's fine, I can sleep in the car. -I'm going to go wash up. -Okay. GO-GAME JOURNAL I'm so sorry for telling you this now, Bo-ra. Anyway, it's not too late. We can support you now. Study what you've always wanted to. Prepare for the bar exam. As parents, it breaks our hearts that we couldn't help you fulfill your dream. Every time we think about that... we're too ashamed to face you. So, don't worry about money. We're debt-free now. Be at ease, and prepare for the exam. No matter how many years it takes, I'm going to support you. Okay? I'll... think about it. Okay. Sure. Take your time. Think carefully. Oh, my. We'll have to move to a house with an indoor bathroom. It's too cold outside. By the way, Bo-ra hasn't said anything, has she? She needs time to think. She's starting the part-time job tomorrow. Looks like she is going. It's not the time to start working. I'm upset that she had to waste that smart brain all this time. What's taking her so long? She might make a wrong move. Don't say a thing. It's not an easy decision. She buried her wish the whole time. The thought of pursuing it now is probably pretty scary. I have faith in Bo-ra. She'll make the right decision. Geez, you two practically made a movie together. They're both idiots. He was right there. How could you not see him? So, what did you two do? Oh, my God. By any chance, did you guys... hold hands? Come on! Jung-bong isn't like that. He's so naive. Maggie would be lucky if he made eye contact. Right? His face got red and he couldn't say anything, right? You know nothing about men, do you? No way! Then, did you two... hug? Don't ask. Big deal! Soo-yeon, did you give him the gift? It was pretty. What present? I bought a shirt for Jung-hwan's birthday. It had a hint of pink. Maggie picked it out. Did he wear it? No. I thought he'd wear it yesterday, but he didn't. No way. He was probably embarrassed to wear it right away. I guess I was wrong again. I thought differently. Soo-yeon. Yeah? Some lady over there is looking for you. -Who is she? -She says she's the class president's mom. What? Let's go. SSANGMUN GIRLS' HIGH PLEASE BE QUIET! Hey! Be quiet! Aren't you guys going to college? Hey, you're louder. Good grades mean everything? We're seniors. I know. Hello, Mr. Choi. -Oh, you're home. -Yes. Did Jin-ju have a good time? Yes, we had fun. We are at the same level. Thank you. Of course. It's cold. Go inside. Your mom is waiting. -Okay. Good night. -Good night. Wow, Park Chul-soon gave this to us when OB won the championship in 1982. Do you remember? Of course. I got the ball and gave it to you. You were jumping up and down with joy. I remember it like yesterday. My friends only like soccer. I like baseball though. It's been such a long time since I played catch. By the way, is grumbling Jung-hwan doing well? Yes, he's doing well. He's still the same, always grumbling. Sun-woo, I made zucchini pancakes! Come out! Okay. Eat this plate of apples. Okay. Do you ever plan on wearing this shirt? Don't you like the color? It's my favorite color. Would you mind giving this shirt to me? SSANGMUN GIRLS' HIGH Don't mind her. Our class president is the same way. All class presidents are so annoying. Good grades are all that matter to them. I'm off. -You coming to lunch? -Yes. Call someone. What should we do? Hey, do something! Move! Go away! Don't look. The doors! Shut the doors! SSANGMUN GIRLS' HIGH INFIRMARY You're awake. Are you okay? I passed out again, didn't I? The girls must have seen everything. It's okay. They're your classmates. Who cares? It happens. It's okay. It's okay. It's fine. Class President. It's cold. Close the door. Okay. Hey, what took you so long? Get over here. Hurry up and take out your lunch. We want to eat your sausages. You brought seaweed? Wow, you sure are rich. That's way better than mine. Awesome! Kimchi. Seasoned aster. And underneath? Wow. -Ta-da. -Whoa, what's the occasion? I forgot to bring a spoon. What should I do? This is really good. I want one. I want bulgogi. Oh, bulgogi. -It's good. -Is it? You eat it. Seriously? Awful. She's ignoring you. She's strange. -It's fine. -The kimchi is too sour! You came home early tonight! I just got home too. The night session was cut short. They need to fix something at school. Mom, where's Jin-ju? At Mr. Choi's place. She's having fun, so I left her there. They're best friends lately. Okay. Aren't you hungry? No. I need to step outside for a moment. -I'll be right back. -Okay. Hello, Mister. She's sleeping! I'll take her. No, open the bedroom door. I'll tuck her in. Your wrists are in bad shape. Hey! What were you thinking about? You didn't even notice me. About you. Yeah, right. I know you, Bo-ra. Bo-ra, can I have a cup of that? Did Mr. Choi come over? Did you find it? Find what? The reason you dislike him. Did you find it? I told you, I don't dislike him. If you say so. It's true. I don't dislike him. We're here. I'll go. Good night. Okay. By the way, Bo-ra, there's really nothing going on as of late, right? No. Why do I feel so uneasy? What about? Just because. What if someone sees you two again? Hello, Bo-ra. Hey. Why doesn't he make any sound? You take care of him. Hey, Choi Taek. Yes? I trust you. I'll sleep in Taek's room. Okay. Did he just get in? Yes, I met him in the alley. Ask if he took a lot of pills today. It isn't good to take too many. Hold on. How many pain killers did you take today? He didn't take too many. Go to sleep. I will. Tell Taek I said good night! Okay. You're warm. You are like a heater. So warm! Stop. No! -You're warm. -What's wrong with you, stop! Sun-woo, stop! My goodness, you're warm. Sun-woo. Is everything well with Bo-ra? Yes. It's good. Taek. Yeah? Why Deok-sun? There are tons of girls who like you. Why Deok-sun? What's the reason? Why do you like her? I just like her. I just like it when I'm with her. When she's not there, I almost feel like I could die. You are one crazy bastard. Wake up, Choi Taek! You need to take more medicine. You don't take enough lately. Take some more pills. Let's take it together. I don't need medicine. Hey, let's go to Brazil Tteok-bokki tomorrow. It's on you. I spent all my allowance for the month. And I have a date tomorrow. -A big night! -Girl! Ah, right. Sung Soo-yeon, you were really awesome today. Forget it. Why? Did something happen? It's nothing. No need to know. -What is it? -It's a secret! Tell me. We'll go. -Bye. -See you. Song-hee left. Can I give you a hug? Thank you, Deok-sun. I am so thankful. It was nothing. But I think I forgot a few things. No, you did a great job. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. You are so lovely. I'm sorry, but please do this favor for me. It's not difficult. If she passes out, just remove any dangerous objects around her, and take her to the infirmary. Okay? I will. Oh, and she might throw up, so turn her head slightly to the side. Please take care of her. I'm so sorry to ask you this. Yes, Teacher. Why are you calling so late? Did Deok-sun get into trouble again? No, ma'am. Please give her a lot of praise when she comes home. We have a student with epilepsy in our class. Her mother was very concerned. My goodness, is that so? -Yes. -Oh, my... -She must be so worried. -Yes. She did? Oh, yes. Oh, my. Okay. {\an8}I had no idea, ma'am. {\an8}THE DAY BEFORE THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL {\an8}Song-hee's previous homeroom teacher hasn't talked about it. {\an8}The kids in that class are tight-lipped. I had no idea. I owe a lot to everyone. Oh, no, don't worry! There's a sweet and kind girl in our class named Deok-sun. If something were to happen, you can count on her. There's nothing to worry about. She's very smart. Thank you, Teacher. Thank you. No problem at all. She must have very good grades. Not at all. But she is smart. Our Soo-yeon is really sweet. Good girl. So, is she sleeping? No, she's studying in her room. She's a senior now. Sweet little rascal! What am I doing? I'll have to praise her for her good deed. I'll go to her room. There is our daughter, Deok-sun. Of course, she is. Oh my, that boy is hilarious. He's going to be a very famous comedian someday. For sure, Mom. So far, he's the funniest guy on Viva Youth. Geez. And Deok-- I mean Soo-yeon will be accepted to Seoul National University. Do you think becoming a comedian is easy? I can tell this is as good as he'll ever be. Not more, not less. He looks like a grasshopper. Want to bet? Let's bet on it! Geez. No-eul, can you excuse me? I need to talk to Mom and Dad. Hello? Okay, Bo-ra. I'll leave now. Mom, I'll be right back. Bye, Jin-ju! -I made dumpling soup. Don't be long. -Okay. What happened? Oh, my. Jin-ju. Did you hurt your head? Oh, no! Something's going on, right? You couldn't do the job? That's not it. What is it, then? Why won't you tell me? I'm going to tell you. Sun-woo, I-- Sun-woo, come! Jin-ju is going to the hospital! I'll go with you. No, I'll call you later. Are you going somewhere? To Taek's room. He's buying pizza tonight. Taek is such a saint. You guys are all jerks. Who are? Who? Isn't it time to watch Knight Rider? Oh? I'll see you later. Hi, Soo-yeon. I'm off to see my date. Wish me luck. Here already? Go first. I'm going to leave later-- I'll get going, then. Hey... Damn it! SEOUL DOBONG CLINIC Is Jin-ju all right? She's fine. Don't worry. She must've been shocked. Her head is fine, right? Her X-rays are fine. Don't worry. She took some medicine to calm her down from the shock. It's okay. You must have been so scared. A little. I'm fine now. I bet you were so shocked. I was. But you were more shocked than me. No, I'm fine now. Weren't you meeting someone today? I'm alright. Go about your business. No, it's okay. I'll stay here. I'll go get a cup of coffee, then. Okay. Jin-ju, you're awake. It must have hurt a lot. I bet you were shocked. Mister... What? Where is Mr. Choi? Do you miss Mr. Choi? Yes. Okay, stay here. I'll go get him for you. I hope Jin-ju is all right. I was scared to death. You don't think something's wrong, right? Should we take her to a bigger hospital? No, she's fine. Okay? Still. It's okay. Don't cry. It's nothing to cry about. While I was hanging the laundry, she fell down. I should have been watching her. It's my fault! You can't watch her 24 hours a day. It's okay. It can happen. I hate this! I really hate this! It's okay. Don't worry. Don't cry. SEOUL DOBONG CLINIC Why did you come? Hi. Is Jin-ju all right? She's fine. Good. Let's go. Did something happen? Bo-ra, I think I know now. About what? The reason I dislike Mr. Choi. Now, I know... why I dislike him. I feel sorry for my dad. I feel... so sorry for my dad. I feel sorry for my dad. I think Mom makes the best dumpling soup in the world. I think everything your mom makes is delicious. Dad. Today... Jin-ju got hurt. Yeah. Mom was really shocked. But she told me she was fine. She told Taek's dad... that she was scared and she cried. It seems... Mom is more comfortable with him than she is with me. She just didn't want you to worry. I understand completely. Dad. Aren't you upset? Sun-woo, I'm not upset at all. Sun-woo. I... can't do anything for your mom. I just... had to be by her side. And now, I can't even do that. Sun-woo. I... just want your mom to be happy. That's all I want. Dad. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Dad... What's up with you? Are you shooting a movie? Master, I'm curious about something. Tell me. Why won't anyone like me? Oh, it's Taek. Nope, never mind. I'm serious. I know, I'm serious too. Why isn't there anyone who likes me? I guess I'm unworthy of love. -Deok-sun. -Yeah? Do you like watery sweet potatoes or chestnut sweet potatoes? Watery ones. Do you like Lee Moon-sae or Park Nam-jung? Lee Moon-sae. Do you like me or Taek? Taek. How annoying. You don't like me? I just like Taek more. Then, do you like Jung-hwan or Sun-woo? Don't ask questions like that. Deok-sun. How do you feel? Instead of other people liking you, who is it that you like? You have a strong preference on sweet potatoes, but not on the person you like? Deok-sun, I mean, Soo-yeon. You can like someone instead of being liked by someone. Right? Kids these days only know quadratic formula, not life. But you know neither. What do you know? Huh? Geez. Fine. Get up. Going somewhere? Pizza's here. How many pizzas did you buy? Five. You're definitely rich. My match ended late and I didn't think I could eat with you guys. So, I bought each of you one to eat at home. Taek, let's get married. No, thank you. Go home. He needs to sleep. Bye now. I'll eat this all myself. Nothing for the dean. I'm going to go too. Stay for a bit. Okay. PLEASE READ, MY LOVELY TAEK Sit down. Did you write back? It must be nice to not be interested in anything else but Go-game. You've never liked someone before, right? You only care about Go-game. That's not true. Yeah, right. Don't lie. Who are you trying to fool? You're in the palm of my hand. There's nothing I don't know about you. You don't know anything about me. There's someone I like. I'm going to confess to her. Soon. Do you ever plan on wearing this shirt? Don't you like the color? It's my favorite color. Would you mind giving this shirt to me? No. Not this shirt. How did you know my size? It fits me perfectly. I really wanted this shirt. When did you get it? I got the package this morning. Don't tell Soo-yeon. She'll tease me if she finds out I copied her. It'll be our secret. Then... good night. Soo-yeon! What's wrong? Why are you running? Have you lost your mind? {\an8}Everyone likes Deok-sun. {\an8}How does she do that? {\an8}Did something happen? {\an8}What? {\an8}Crazy bastard! {\an8}Did someone get hurt? {\an8}There was an accident or something in front of Gwangsan supermarket. {\an8}Should I transfer him to a different hospital or what? {\an8}Are you going to confess to Deok-sun? {\an8}Taek. {\an8}Yeah? {\an8}They say, if you want to know if someone likes you, look into their eyes. {\an8}Eyes can't lie. {\an8}Do you think Deok-sun will believe me if I confess my feelings for her? {\an8}Subtitle translation by Stefanie Elalouf
