 We've almost paid off our debts. Even if I had a million mouths, there's nothing I could say. I'm sorry. Oh, yeah, where did your mom go so early? She just made this radish green soup and left. Let's eat. Did Mother go somewhere? I don't know. She put on a bunch of makeup and headed out this morning. Where did Mom go? I don't know. She didn't tell me either. What do you want to know? Our three kids are all the same age.

 They're all going to be seniors. My son gets good grades. Will he be accepted to Seoul University? And what about my son? Will he also be accepted? I have a daughter, will she be accepted to any college in Seoul? Ask one at a time. Then, I'll go first. My son gets pretty good grades, but luck plays a big part in taking exams. So... he'll get in, right? Great fortune is coming. Excuse me? This year, great luck will come to your eldest son. What? Oh, my, how strange. How did she know you had an older son? My eldest son? Yeah... the younger one will do fine on his own. But your older son, doesn't he always cause you grief? By great luck, you mean... Do I need to tell you all that? No. Ma'am, by this year, do you mean the lunar calendar or the solar calendar? Of course, I mean the lunar calendar, silly. There isn't much time left then. -The Lunar New Year is coming soon. -Right. There isn't even a week left. Oh, my... What if he wins the lottery again? What are you thinking? -What is it? -Huh? Those on the wait list will be announced soon. -Oh, my God! -Congratulations! Your suffering is over now! Congratulations! Oh, my God, there is something that important coming up. That must be it! If you're just going to chatter, go to a coffee shop. Next. What about my son? Will he be accepted into Seoul University? I see greater happiness than that in your fate. Excuse me? In my fate? Mine? What is it? FAIRY SHAMAN What? Oh, my! Stop laughing. Life is full of twists and turns. Doesn't it seem like I'm getting prettier lately? No, you haven't gotten any prettier. Next. Yes. I have a daughter. -But she really-- -Sucks at studying, right? -Yes. -She's so on point. She's just bad in academics. I'm not even hoping for a college in Seoul. I'd be happy if she got into any college. Will Deok-sun be accepted to any college? Change it. Change what? Her name is the problem. Her name is Deok-sun? Yes... Sung Deok-sun, means virtuous and nice. Her name is the problem. Because of her name, she's doing poorly in school. Change her name. Don't call her Deok-sun until she goes to college. Don't use that name. Every time you call her Deok-sun, the rank of the college she'll go to will be lowered. Understand? I'll never call her Deok-s-- I mean, I won't call her that again. So... what should I call my daughter? Soo-yeon! Soo-yeon, what are you doing? I told you to take the stew. Here we go. Mom, who's Soo-yeon? Is someone coming over? You're Soo-yeon, starting today. How come? We have to call her Soo-yeon for her to get into college. Freaking bullshit... Don't you dare call her Deok-sun. Soo-yeon. Every time you call her Deok-sun, the rank of the college she'll go to will drop. Soo-yeon. Drop down to where? Bullshit. Why are we changing her perfectly fine name? What's wrong with Deok-sun? Deok-sun is a nice name. Soo-yeon. What are you saying? If you call her Deok-sun, you have to say Soo-yeon right away to nullify the bad luck. This is how desperate I am. I like it. What good will it do if we call her Soo-yeon? -Everyone else will call her Deok-sun. -Soo-yeon. I've told everyone in town. They'll all call her Soo-yeon. Way to freaking go. How will that change overnight? You're the trouble! Don't call her Deok-sun. Soo-yeon. Got that? Why can't I say my own daughter's name as I please? Huh? Deok-sun is a great name! Deok-sun! Soo-yeon! Eat up, Soo-yeon. You'll really have to study hard. Why are you pushing the table toward me? If you have an issue, just say so. What? I didn't push it. The table always leans toward the stomach of whoever sits there. What are you saying? It keeps leaning toward me because you're pushing it! I told you, I didn't! Then did the floor become slanted? Geez, so frustrating. Maybe it did! What? Here, look! If I drop the tangerine, it will stay still. If the floor is slanted, it will roll. Watch. See, it rolled. Where did it go? That's weird. Watch, if I drop it, it should stay still. -All the floors-- -What? Dad. Where will we sleep? Where? We'll have to sleep at the owner's place! That'll be inconvenient. It'll be awesome. Much better than our place. Okay. Bo-ra and Deok-sun-- Soo-yeon. I know it's inconvenient, but we can deal for a little while. The construction will be over before the New Year. It's not inconvenient at all. I love that house. YELLOW PAGES DO NOT SLEEP STUDY ROOM Should I go on the blind date? Should I? Don't go on the blind date. I got rejected. How come? Did you confess, by any chance? -Are you crazy? -She must be. Hey. For girls like us, love is over on the day we confess. You sure have some nerve. How could you confess? Our love has to remain one-sided. Confession leads to immediate rejection. What's with you? This happens all the time. So naive... Even so, just in case... Oh, yeah. -Deok-sun. -It's Soo-yeon. Oh, yeah, Soo-yeon. What happened with you? Did you tell him? He told her not to go on the blind date. Hey, see, I told you I was certain this time. Even so, you can't confess first, no matter what. Wait until he confesses. Crying made me hungry. -Let's go to Brazil. -Okay. You two go. I have to go home. What? You go crazy for tteokbokki. I like Deok-sun. Not as a friend, but as a woman. Jung-hwan! Come out and have dinner! Okay. Four, six, eight. Oh, Jung-hwan. Come over here. What are you doing? Still not done? Almost done. Just wait a bit longer. What's for dinner? What's she making? She's making Western food since we're all having dinner together. What, exactly? Hamburg steak. You know, I've only ever seen photos of Hamburg steak. I've never had it. Mi-ran, give it to us already. We're starving. All right, already! Wow... so this is Hamburg steak? It looks like tteokgalbi. There's not much to it, really. What about Mr. Sung? Is he coming soon? He's working late tonight. Anything I can help you with? Ladle the soup into bowls. -Oh, the soup? -Yeah. Okay. Hello. Is that you, Sun-woo? Where's your mom? She went to go get Mr. Choi. She'll be here soon. Sit. Hello. Move. Hi. Mi-ran, did you go to the US to buy steak-- Be careful. Let's have some of this soup thing first. Be careful. It's hot. Mom, what is it? Is it pumpkin porridge? It's just she gave us so much... Looks great. I could bathe in this for three days straight. Mi-ran! What about the steak? Hurry up with-- Steak's here. I put a lot of work into this. This looks different from the ones at the restaurant. What's with this kimchi? It doesn't fit here. It was really oily at the restaurant, so I made some special fusion cuisine. Eat up. -Thank you. -Thank you for the food. It's delicious. After tasting the steak and the radish kimchi together, it feels like Eastern and Western cultures are coming together. It's as if I'm tasting Hellenism itself. Hellenism is not it? It is. -Where's Deok-sun? Why isn't she coming? -Soo-yeon. Where's Soo-yeon? At the study room. She said she'd be back for dinner. -Oh. -Oh, dear. We're here. -Hello. -Welcome. We're here? Looks good. It's too crowded here. The adults should eat at the table. Get up, honey. -Okay. -Here we go. Where's Taek? You should have brought him. The day after tomorrow is his highest rank title match. He won't even come out of his room, studying his brains out. Highest rank? Doesn't Taek have the title now? Yes, but... his opponent this time is his mentor, so he feels pressured. Mi-ran, why did you make the short ribs so flat? You country bumpkin, this isn't short ribs. It's called skate. It's steak. Oh, skaekuh? Steak. It's hamburg skaeki. Westerners eat this. What's this? Is this snot soup? It looks gross. Sun-young, get me water please? We should bring some to Taek. He's not even eating. I'm here. Oh, Deok-sun. -Deok-sun. Welcome. -Soo-yeon! -Hi, Soo-yeon. -Welcome, Soo-yeon, Mom, I want short ribs too. Soo-yeon, can you go drop this off at Taek's? He didn't come? He has a match the day after tomorrow. He won't budge from his room. If he doesn't eat the short ribs, make sure he has some soup, okay? Okay. -Eat before it gets cold. -Okay. It won't taste good cold. Deok-sun. Soo-yeon. Who's Soo-yeon? Me, I'm Soo-yeon. Call me Soo-yeon from now on, so I can go to college. Are you laughing at me? No. No way. Don't you mess with me. I've been letting you off the hook a lot these days. Okay. But Deok-sun... It's Soo-yeon, you idiot. Yeah... Soo-yeon. Can you make me some coffee? Put milk in it like before. Okay. Focus on what you're doing. Go on. Soo-yeon. Can I have water? Soo-yeon. I heard Taek's been receiving a lot of fan mail. If there's a decent girl, Taek can marry her. That's so not Taek. He won't show feelings for someone he likes. He won't say a word. Taek shows it. How does he show it? Sun-young, can you get me some more sauce? -Yes. -Sauce. Given his personality, he won't act all cutesy, right? No, he doesn't... know how to act cute, just like me. Sun-young, can you pass me tissues? Okay. So then, how does Taek show that he likes someone? -He's a bit clingy. -What? He's clingy with someone he likes. He asks her to do a lot of things, too. He acts really polite toward people he doesn't like. Sun-young, can you get me a smaller bowl? Geez, stop asking Sun-young to do everything. Did I? Sun-young, no need for the bowl. I want warm water. You little-- Hey! You do it! I was being nice since you're working so hard. Am I your servant? Huh? Ouch, that hurts! There's a kettle right there, do it yourself! Okay. You hit so hard. -Hey. -Yeah? The plug. Geez, give it here. It's fine. I can do it. Right. It's bleeding. Well... Deok-sun. Soo-yeon. Yeah. Soo-yeon. Get some sleep. I'll be working. Why isn't my sister coming back? It's been a while. She must be eating with Taek. They have a lot in common. Meet me in the alley in ten minutes. Get away from me. What are you two up to? I don't know what you're up to, but can I join? Let's do it together. Me too. It's nothing. I just have to ask her something. When are the second-round college acceptances announced? You're so mean. Jung-bong, No-eul, I'm off to the study room. See you later. Mom, I'm going to the study room. Jin-ju, your brother's gone? Right? Honey, I have to make a delivery. This late? I missed one delivery. I'll be quick. He is so diligent. He's only diligent for his job, not in the bedroom. Never mind, I shouldn't have said that. Oh, yeah. Did you get your passport? Did you mean passport? Let me have a look. Wow... you look so pretty. You must be so happy. You get to go abroad. It's only Japan. It's so close. There isn't even a time difference. When are you leaving? End of the month. Just three days left. I can't believe I'm spending New Year in Tokyo. Will the kids go to your mom's place? Yeah, I told them to go to Gohan. Where's Sun-young? We have to get started. -Hello. -Hey. -Hi, you. -Hey. Mi-ran. Can you watch Jin-ju for a little? Where are you going? We have to play Go-Stop. Starting today, I'm working as a cleaner at Uksoo Bathhouse. -What? -What? I work there from 8:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. I have to earn some money. -If Sun-woo finds out, he'll be angry. -How will he find out? He goes to a study room nowadays. He eats dinner at home, but doesn't come back until late. He is so punctual like his dad. He never comes home before 1:00 a.m. Why did you start working? Are you short? Do you need a loan? No way. I can work. I don't need to borrow. It's not because I'm short on money. I have to save for Sun-woo to go to college next year. Thankfully, being a cleaner at a bathhouse is an easy job. I don't need special skills. Won't Jin-ju ask for you? Don't you worry. This will take care of it. Oh, my. She plays well. -I'll go. -Okay. -Oh, you're so good. -Yes. She's going to get caught. By the way, Go-Stop isn't fun with just two people. No worries. There's one person who's lounging about during the break. Bo-ra. What took you so long? It's been 15 minutes. Do you want to tell the whole world we're dating? Who's watching? There's no one here. Hey. How can you eat that so late? -Oh, Sun-woo. -Hi. What are you two doing? I have to talk to her about something. This late? Just you two? Talk about what? You can talk at home. It's nothing really. I was curious about something while studying and bumped into her-- Hey, get lost. What's it to you what we're doing? Don't pry into adult matters. Get lost. Okay. Bo-ra. Do you have any coins? Thanks. Let's go. There's definitely something going on. Jung-bong, doesn't it seem like the two of them... TRY AGAIN NEXT TIME Damn it, I lost again! It's okay. If you have a couple more, you will get the free bag. Don't get upset over something like that. TRY AGAIN NEXT TIME How many bags did you eat? Two whole boxes. I always lose. I've never gotten the free bag coupon. -Jung-bong. -Yes? Watch Jin-ju. Okay. Going somewhere? To earn some money. All right, let's see how skilled our dean is. You cut the deck. I'll pass. Tap. We all know each other, no need to cut it. I heard you're quite good, Mr. Ryu. Not at all. I've only played at school a few times when I had to stay late. I know nothing. Then, shall I try to win some money from Ssangmun High's dean of students? Yes, let's. Shall we? Okay, let's start. Here we go. -Oh, 12. -Wow. Anyway, what's Joosoyadae? Oh, my... we're playing with a person who doesn't even know the rules. I feel so bad to win. That's how he learns. Then I'll just choose anything. It's rain again. Then, me. Oh, no, I'm last. What will I do? Okay, let's go. Quick! -Help me out. -Okay. Hey, high school senior, go study. You have to be successful. I don't need to go tonight. I just wanted to leave the house. Want to go see a movie? No. I'm busy. I have to study. Why are you be busy? Isn't it winter break? I'm preparing for something, but you don't need to know about it. When will we go on a date? We did, just now. I'm cold. Bye. Are you crazy? You have a death wish? Do I need to if I want to hold your hand? Yes. Do it if you have a death wish. Got it? I'm off. I'll be in front of your house later. I'll be sleeping. See you tomorrow. It's so cold. Sun-woo, pass me some blankets. Geez... Thanks. What should I write? MR. JUNG-BONG DEAR JUNG-BONG To Jung-bong? Hi, Jung-bong? Here we go. Yeah! One each. One-Go. Godori. Two-Go. Five kings. Three-Go! No king and not enough junk cards. I feel so bad. Wait, what? You played with Mr. Ryu? He's so bad. You shouldn't associate with him. You have to stay alert to play with Mr. Ryu. What do you mean? How much did you lose? One hundred twenty won. Geez... that guy. Don't worry. I'll win you ten times what you lost. Hold onto him this evening. Wait there. Mr. Sung is known as The Mr. Ryu Killer. I'll close the store early today and come home. There are no customers this time of year. So, when are they announcing the second round admittees? It'll probably be hard for him to get in this time, right? It's tomorrow. He really has to get in this time. It's hard for us, but harder for him. He says nothing, but I'm sure he's taking it hard. It's hard to get into colleges outside of Seoul. Oh, dear. Hello? Sun-woo? Just a sec, I'll put Jung-hwan on. I'm taking a shower. Hey. Stop looking at me. Now what? Okay. I said okay. Take one later. It's foggy in there. It's hard to see. Fine. No-eul, have you taken a bath here? Soo-yeon, who says bath anymore? It's a shower. It's so nice and warm. Not at all cold. Right? And we don't have to wear shoes. I wish we could live here forever with Jung-bong. Oh, yeah, have they announced admission results or is that tomorrow? You're seriously so mean. What did I do? Let's not be like this to each other. Soo-yeon, give me your laundry. They'll run the washer. You too, No-eul. I don't have any. Me neither. I washed them while I was showering. Don't you dare buy anything on the way home. I'll lock you out. Got it? Okay. Please, buy something on the way home. I have been buying things. Should I buy a steamed bun? You like them. Buy a whole pack, not just one! Okay, one pack! Stop yelling. I got so scared. Anyway, come home early so we can get our revenge. Okay? Okay. I'll leave before the bank closes. I'll close the store early, too. Geez. Honey! I'm home! Mi-ran! I bought an entire pack! This flowerpot... Aren't those earrings heavy? What do you want to be when you grow up? Magic Princess Minky. Minky? If you eat all your food, I'll buy you a magic wand. Really? Sun-woo, isn't it time for you to go to the study room? It's already 8:00 p.m. Mom, I'm out of here. Bye, Jin-ju. Okay! Study hard! Okay. Jin-ju, don't eat that. Get up. Let's go. TRY AGAIN NEXT TIME Jung-bong, I'll leave her with you. May the odds be in your favor. He will be exhausted in February. There are the most competitions in winter. Didn't you know that? You're his friend. Tomorrow's match is the toughest on him. He's spending the night at the club. -Jung-hwan. -Yeah? Did the dean leave yet? Go look. What took you so long? You're five minutes late. I bet I'm the only girl who drops her boyfriend off at the study room. It's because we don't have time for dates. Did you have a late dinner? I only get to see you for a bit after dinner. Then let's eat dinner together. I don't have to eat at home. But I have to. How come? Otherwise, Jin-ju and Mom will have to eat by themselves. I want to have dinner with them during the break. Good kid. I like you because you're good. Is that all? Yeah. Just that one trait. I have a lot. A lot of what? Reasons why I like you. Whatever, shut it, I don't want to hear. Don't say anything. You know, I liked your old glasses more. The round ones. Lee Sun-hee style. They were prettier. It's my face, so I'll do as I please. Don't tell me what to do. Also, you always wear pants. Hurry up. You are going, right? I don't go to concerts with men. What about you, Jung-hwan? He'll go. He's a fan of Lee Moon-sae. You're going, right? I can't. I wonder if Taek will go. He's too busy in February. Why? Do you have something going on? He doesn't go anywhere during competition time, so he won't go. But then, if Deok-sun goes, he'd follow her there. Wait, no. He is Master Choi. Go-game is more important than a woman. You really can't go? No, I can't. I'm going to the bathroom. Then, who else is there? Taek, Jung-hwan, Sun-woo-- Oh, Sun-woo, go with him. He likes music. He likes Lee Sun-hee, but he likes Lee Moon-sae just as much. How can he not like him at our age? -Shut it, already. -Lee Moon-sae. -Want a steamed bun? -No, that's okay. You're not playing Go-Stop? I don't know how. All the folks over there are pros, so the stakes are quite high. What? Really? Okay. Five, six, seven points. I shook it, so 14 points. Ms. Cheetah has not enough junk cards. I win with 28 points, 280 won. Mr. Sung, 140 won. Thank you. You're so good. How much? Two hundred eighty won. Ten won per point is too much. Change it to three, five, seven, nine betting. The first round barely matters anyway. Anyway, Mr. Ryu, deal me some good cards, okay? Okay. Okay. Shall we play for real now? What?  They're playing Go-Stop with my dad? Yes. They played yesterday, too. Why? Is there a problem? There'll be a huge fight tonight. He's so humiliating. Did you know my father's nickname when he was young? I'll have to pace myself during this round. Oh, this is better than nothing. What the hell are you doing? Stop your hand tricks. Put the black bush cards back. They're mine. "They're mine"? Those were laying down there before. How could a teacher be a con artist? If you do that again, I'm going to smash your fingers. Let's play right. You can't fool me anymore. He was Nampodong's Con Artist. It's because he cheats all the time while playing Go-Stop. He's not even a swindler. So embarrassing. It won't work against my dad. You know where my dad works, right? Hanil Bank. So? Do you know which department? Two points with the cheongdan. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve points. Oh, geez... You have a death wish? I'll aim for your hand next time. He works at the Investigation Department. What does he do there? Fraud detection. He catches those who misuse company funds or scam others. Four points and cheongdan. So, seven, eight, nine points. Not enough junk cards, so 18 points. One hundred eighty won. Mr. Con Artist Teacher. No king and not enough junk cards. So, 36 points gives me 360 won. Please be a good role model to the students. Oh, my! My husband is so good. I'm going to take all the money here and buy you a mink coat. Taking all. The card matched. All five kings. Chodan. Hongdan. Cheongdan. Godori. You think my mom is just sitting around while they're playing? My mom's Ra Mi-ran. Big trouble. The siren is on. Let's take it all! Oh, my, I took them all again! Ms. Cheetah has no king and no junk cards. Oh, my. I'm going to get some water. What are you doing? This is a big one. Don't you move to get water. Stay right there. How can I get water without moving? If you get Go this time, you'll have Five-Go, right? Wow, Five-Go! You get double of quadruple. Oh, honey. I think you'll have to visit the hospital a lot this winter. Why? When you wear the mink coat, you'll get heat rashes. That's why. Who cares about heat rashes? I'm getting a fur coat. This is great. She may not be as skilled a Go-Stop player, but she has this. What's her IQ? It's not related to IQ. She has lots of tricks. Jin-ju, scratch it with the utmost care. Jin-ju, let's go. One more bag! TRY AGAIN NEXT TIME You have no luck, either. Jin-ju. Want to play with me? -Oh, my. -Oh, my, Jin-ju's here. Come here. Hi Jin-ju. You should've come earlier. What took you so long? Okay. I'll say it one more time. Okay. Five-Go! Oh, my, really. Oh, my goodness. I might have a heart attack because I'm about to win this big. Let me say this one more time. Five-Go! Looks like I'll be wearing a fur coat now! Oh, my! Oh, my, Jin-ju! -Oh, my. -Dear! The round is canceled. Oh, my goodness. It's canceled. What do we do? Jin-ju! Jin-ju! Gosh, I'm late. Good morning. -You're leaving a bit late today. -Yes. -Mr. Ryu. -Yes? It's not over until it's over, right? Excuse me? We have to have a proper round two tonight. I'm going to Busan tonight. It's New Year's Day. Have a good New Year's Day. A happy new year. Dreams and hopes that disappeared into space. What will happen today... As the travel regulation has been completely lifted, people will now be able to receive passports regardless of age. Also, there's no limit on the number of overseas visits. As a result, the number of people applying for passports and traveling abroad has dramatically increased... You're leaving tomorrow, right? Yeah. I'm so jealous. I wonder when I'll ever be able to travel on an airplane. What are you jealous about? You have two daughters. There'll be lots of chances. I guess passports are issued quickly nowadays. It used to be difficult as you must show at least 2 million won in the bank. It's simple nowadays. You just need to submit an application with proof of residency and your identification. It's valid for three years. Three years? Wow, that's so long. It's gotten a lot better. Why does it matter? It's not like I have money. You're the one I am most jealous of. You don't have a care in the world. Why wouldn't I? I have that one thing. You mean Jung-bong? They're announcing the results at 2:00 p.m. If Jung-bong got into college, I wouldn't want anything else. He will. Don't worry. The shaman said he has great luck coming his way. He will pass this year. I'm going to put my faith in her. That way, Soo-yeon can go to college, too. What about Sun-young? Will she really get into trouble? That's not trouble. It'd be a blessing. She's still young. She'll have to meet a man soon to cause trouble. When will she do all that? There's no time. Liking someone takes no time. It can happen in an instant. Geez... Where did you meet your husband? Oh, yeah. -You met him in Gohan, right? -Yes. Yes, I met him in Gohan. Want me to tell you the story? Do you listen to music like this? You're so high-class. It's only Vivaldi. Even when we were all broke together, you had a different air about you. You seemed so smart, so I wondered why you came to Ssangmun. Because of love. I used to work in the financial sector. I think I was the best at that in Gohan. I was a good worker. And then, I met Jung-bong's dad. -I liked him more than he liked me. -Oh, my. He was quite handsome back in the day. He's still good-looking. No. He's a mess now, all shriveled up. I went to the bus terminal because of an errand I had to do. I saw a soldier standing there. He looked like Buddha. He was enveloped in the light. His head looked like a peeled chestnut. Jung-hwan. You're really not going to the concert? The Lee Moon-sae concert. I have plans with my friends. What plans? We're going to Seoul Land. Which friends? You wouldn't know them. You have friends I don't know? Yeah, I do. Sorry. Let's go together next time. I need to change. Okay. It's time. Ah yes, hello. Yes, the Law Department. His number is... Eight, six, three, seven, five, seven. -Just a moment. -Okay. -Hello? -Yes. I'm sorry, but he didn't make it. Were the results announced? How did it go? Where are you going? To argue with that shaman. Forget it. What's the use? Great luck? Great luck, my ass! It's great misfortune! I won't stand for this. Come on, don't be like that. What good will it do? There's nothing we can do. If she didn't say that, I wouldn't have had any expectations. She's made a fool of me! I won't let it go. -No. -Don't do it! Let go of me! -Honey, stop. -Mi-ran. Let go! I won't stand for this. -Honey. -Let go! -Honey, please. -Please, just-- So, they must be in a bad mood. I knew it when she said strange things about me. Yes. I'm about to have lunch now. Sun-woo will be back from the study room soon. Then send Bo-ra, Jung-hwan, Soo-yeon-- I mean Deok-sun. And No-eul, too, send them here. They won't be able to have a meal over there. I'll whip up some kimchi fried rice. Yes. Geez... really. I was hoping for a new life at this age... Figures. I'll make the kimchi fried rice really delicious this time. Where did Jung-hwan go? He ran an errand for his mother. He went to the travel agency. Oh, what about Bo-ra? I don't know. She left right after breakfast. I asked her where she was going, and she hit me hard. Oh, my, she hits you, too? -I thought she hits Deok-sun-- -I'm Soo-yeon. You're Deok-sun again. Excuse me? Something just came up. I thought she only hit Deok-sun. She's really something. I feel bad for the guy who will take her as his bride. When did she say she'd be back? I don't know. I'd have to risk my life to ask that. Poor No-eul. Do you want to live here? I'd be happy anywhere as long as it's not our house. Is that right? Get up. Jung-bong is hungry. You have to feed him, at least. Why should I? There you go, again. Don't try to have so much. We didn't expect him to make it on the second round. Don't displace your anger at the shaman on Jung-bong. Mi-ran, you're so sweet. My wife is the best. Shut up! Jung-bong, let's have some-- Son. It's okay. We decided to try many times. A man shouldn't have his shoulders slumped. Don't break my heart. Come out here and have lunch. I'm hungry. Bong. I'll be waiting for you, so come out. Where did Jung-hwan go? I sent him to the travel agency to make a payment. You still didn't pay? We leave tomorrow. It's fine, payment was due today. After you eat, go to the bathhouse. Bath? I don't want to. You'll go abroad without taking a bath? Go with Jung-bong. I'm fine though. Go. Yes, ma'am. Where did she go? I haven't seen her all day. Nice to meet you. My pleasure. Wow, you speak Japanese? Not really, just practicing a few phrases. It's such a shame you stay at home. If you worked, you'd be living in an even bigger house. This house is more than I need. The New Year holiday begins tomorrow. Aren't you going home? We bought train tickets. We're going tomorrow. My mother-in-law isn't alive, so we'll visit her grave. Are you done packing? Aren't you leaving tomorrow morning? I am. I packed everything a month ago. Hello? It's me, Mom. Yeah, Jung-hwan, did you make the payment? Yes, but can you get your passport? My passport? Just a moment. Why? The hotel's changed, so they need your name in English again. Can you spell out your name in English as written on your passport? The spelling of my name in English... Let's see... Hurry, people are waiting behind me. Jung-hwan. Can you call me back? I have soup on the stove. Talk to you later. Mom. What was that? Did something happen with Jung-hwan? My hotel was changed. I need to check the soup on the stove. Did you pack everything to go to Japan? Your mom packed it all a month ago. Will you be okay even though you don't speak Japanese? I hear people abroad scam Koreans by overcharging them. You think your mom will fall for that? Don't worry. Also, your mom knows a little Japanese. Oh, my. Hello? Jung-hwan. Your mom? Hold on. It's for you. Oh, okay. -Yeah. -Spell your name, now. I'm in a hurry. Why did you hang up? You do have your passport? My passport is... Where was it again? My passport... Mom. I told you people are waiting. Just spell it out. Jung-hwan, water... I'm boiling water. -Talk to you later. -Mom! I'm going to Dooly supermarket for a bit. Okay. Father. Which college did Mother attend? I heard she used to work at a bank, but I wonder what college she went to. -Hello? -Mom! Seriously! Why are you doing this to me? What's so hard about spelling your name in English? Look at your passport now. Yeah. You have your passport in your hand? Yes. On the first page is your photo. Your name in English is next to it. Spell it out. Jung-hwan? Yes? Hurry. You know... I don't know English. I don't know how to read English. Sorry, Son. Your mom didn't go to college. Bank? She said she worked in the financial sector. She lent money in daily installments. Your mom was the biggest lender in Gohan, since she was 15 years old. She was sharp. She even later worked under the Japanese. She sold dollars and yen. She was so smart. Your mom only graduated from elementary school, like me. So what? It doesn't matter at all. I think your mom is the smartest person in the world. You don't need college, or a fancy title. You don't need those. What do you need that piece of paper for? If you're good to others and can provide for yourself, that's good enough. Same to you. I'm fine with it... even if you don't get into college. Look at your mom. She's well off even though she didn't go to college. Jung-bong. I'd like it... if you took after your mom... not me. Isn't your mom such an amazing person? Let's go home. Ms. Cheetah must be waiting. Okay. I used to walk like this. Like this. Honey. Mi-ran, I'm home. Why so late? You ate something on the way, didn't you? No, we didn't. You have red bean on your face. Nothing gets past your mom. Seriously, she knows everything. Sun-young, your bowls. I told you I'd get them. It's okay, it's nice to get some exercise, too. What exercise? It's barely ten steps to your house. Where's Sun-woo? He ate dinner and went to the study room. He'll be back after 1:00 a.m. Jin-ju, aren't you going to say hi? I scare her. Well, you don't exactly have a cute face. You're not going home, are you? Your mother went abroad? Yeah. I gave her a travel package. Are you going to work today, too? Of course. Tomorrow's New Year's Day, so I have to earn today. Are you leaving Jin-ju at Jung-hwan's? Yes, she does well there. Why, are you going to watch her? Oh, no... You know that I'm no good with kids. I'd never leave her with you. You'd pass out with another brain hemorrhage if I did. Did you talk to the travel agent? Yes. Here. I bought it over there. I didn't make dinner tonight. -What? -Why? We're eating out! -Yay! -Eating out! Nice! Jin-ju! Eating out! Dad, we're eating out. -Where are we going? -Eating out. -Where to? -Meat! -Eating out! -Are you that happy? Geez, who keeps doing this? It's an eyesore in the neighborhood. Who did this, again? Oh, no, where did they all go? Oh, no. Moo-sung. Just this once. I'll leave her to you. Sun-young. What a great meal. Back home. I like your food better. The smell won't come off. It's nice. -Call me when the movie starts. -Okay. Jung-hwan. Go sleep in your brother's room tonight. We can't have girls sleep out here when it's so cold. -Bo-ra and Deok-sun... -Soo-yeon. You haven't given that up yet? I want to try and believe her until the very end. It's not over till it's over, as they say. Anyway... Bo-ra and Soo-yeon, sleep in Jung-hwan's room tonight. Oh, yes. It's a bed! I love it. It's pretty clean in here. Good night. Kim Jung-hwan. Good night. You two have gotten really close. We were always close. Where did you go today? Mind your own business. I'm not interested. Hey, do you notice anything different about me? You got even uglier. -What the hell? -What? You got uglier, so I said so! What should I say, then? You really don't notice anything? Hey! Stop. This is someone else's house. Don't you fight again. I'll strip both of you and kick you out. Got it? Okay. Here. Anyway, have a great trip to Japan. Let's drink to that! -Cheers! -Cheers! I'm so jealous of you two. You live in this great house, and you're going to Japan, too. Who's so blessed for this to all have happened? I'm so envious, really. If only Jung-bong had gotten into college. Enough. He's right. Jung-bong can just take it again next year. It'll be his seventh time. If he'd gone to college seven years ago, he would've graduated by now. If he'd gone to the army, he'd be a sergeant major by now. We shouldn't have seen the shaman. If she hadn't told her about great luck, we wouldn't have had such high hopes. Did she say that he'd have great luck? She did say that. We thought he'd get into college for sure. You never know, he might be lucky in some other way. -Some other way? -Yeah. In what other way? How would I know! I'm not a shaman. Even shamans don't know when they'll die. What could be luckier than going to college? ONE FREE BAG She said Deok-sun should change her name, and Jung-bong will be lucky. So, what did she tell Sun-woo's mom? It's so embarrassing, I can't bring myself to repeat it. Nothing you need to know about. You're making me so curious. Maybe she'd meet a nice man and get married or something. Never mind. Oh, yeah, Jin-ju. What happened to her? Oh, no, we forgot. I wonder where Sun-young left her. Moo-sung, sorry I'm so late. Moo-sung? You're back? Are you okay? I'm dying. She's definitely your daughter. She is so unique. Hi, Jin-ju. Mister, what's this? -Be gentle. It hurts. -Okay. Geez, your hair... Jung-hwan. Yeah? Let's go to the concert. Together. You'll go, right? I'll go. Where were you all day today? I just had something to do. You don't need to know. Bo-ra. Were you waiting for me? Who else would I be waiting for at this hour? Well. Dating a high-schooler is troublesome. You got new glasses. You look pretty. Bo-ra. Can I kiss you? Pack your things and go, your grandmother is waiting. -Yes. -Don't worry and have a safe trip. -We're off, then. -Yes. -Gimpo Airport, please. -Okay. I wonder if they'll be okay. They're so immature. Don't worry. Whose children are they? Whose? Yours, of course. They're all grown now. Don't worry. All grown? They still have a ways to go. You packed the passports? Oh, no, the passports! They're right here. Geez. Shall we take a look at your photo? I look like Miss Korea anyway. What's this? Did you write this? What do you mean? This. Did you write this? Jung-hwan wrote it. I know he did. Oh, really? Does he do such considerate things? I was going to ask the kids, but I didn't. It's a bit embarrassing. Wow, our Jung-hwan did this. He's all grown. He is. My kids are all grown. They are. Oh, did your mother leave already? I didn't get to say goodbye. No... -We're late for the train. Hurry! -I'm coming. -Have a great New Year. -Okay. Bye. Hurry up! Hello. Are you leaving now? -Yes. -The bus will be crowded. We're going by train. Watch over the block. -Have a safe trip. -Okay. Jung-bong, wait. Here. I totally forgot. My friend Maggie sent this for you. You know her, right? I heard you two met on the road. Yeah. This is so unexpected. You got really lucky this year. A love letter to Kim Jung-bong? Now, I'm really going. Jung-hwan. The year hasn't ended yet, right? What do you mean? There's something. It's so quiet. Everyone went to their hometowns. It feels lonely. It's so cold. Jin-ju, there's so much food. Sun-woo, call them again and tell them to hurry. -Okay. -I'm here. No need to call. Hello. Sun-woo, it's been a while. Come quick, the food won't taste good. Is it tteokguk? -You do know it's New Year's Day? -I do. -Where's Taek? -He's coming. -I'll go get him. -No, it's okay, eat. He'll be here soon. He loses himself when he plays Go-game. I'll get him. Tell him to hurry. You went to a shaman? So, what did she say? Don't even bring it up. The ladies laughed so hard because of my fortune. Really? Why? What did she say? I'm only telling you because it's you. I see a greater happiness than that in your fate. Excuse me? In my fate? Mine? What is it? You're getting another son. What? Oh, my God. No way. You'll get a son this year. Can you can still get pregnant? It's so great to be young. Isn't it funny? I'm not of child-bearing age anymore. I can't believe what she said to me. It was just a waste of money. You never know. You're still young. What? You must be out of your mind. I'm in my mid-forties. Who knows? A child might fall out of the sky... Right, Sun-woo? What? What do you mean? Hello. Happy New Year, ma'am. -Hi, Jin-ju. -Eat. -Did you stay up all night again? -I'm fine. Are your big matches over? Tell them to stop scheduling so many. The highest rank match is over, so I'm fine. I can rest today and tomorrow. How do I eat this? Just eat it. Here. Hi Deok-sun. You really like her as a woman? She's cute. {\an8}What are you two doing? {\an8}I'm leaving. {\an8}Hi, Jin-ju. {\an8}Let's play together later. {\an8}Sun-woo doesn't know yet, right? {\an8}I'm nervous that he'll find out. {\an8}Sun-woo still doesn't know? {\an8}I'd be in a big trouble if he did. {\an8}It's just that your mom... {\an8}How does Mr. Choi  know something I don't know? {\an8}Why does he know something... {\an8}What? {\an8}Crazy bastard. {\an8}Sis. {\an8}Can we go this weekend? {\an8}Are you done crying? {\an8}Taek's got game. {\an8}Subtitle translation by Stefanie Elalouf
