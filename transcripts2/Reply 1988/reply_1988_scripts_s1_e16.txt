What are you doing next Saturday? Me? Why? What? What did he get? Movie tickets. Taek got them in Jongno. It took him forever. Did Deok-sun make him do that? Taek doesn't know how to get to Jongno!

 He wants to see a movie with her. He'll confess to her after the movie. Finally. Wow. Choi Taek, 6-dan, is finally making his move! Why Saturday? Don't you have a match the day before that? If you win, you win the tournament, right? Whether you win or lose, you should take a day off afterwards. No need to come early. You'll just be playing Go-game. I can hang out with you. I have no time for that. I have to study. You study. I'll just play next to you. As if! Regardless, keep Saturday free. I'll call you after my match. Okay? Other members are taking a day off and coming back Sunday, but he's coming back on Saturday to see Deok-sun. What if he loses? Obviously, he's confident. When and where again? I should go sell flowers. Should we? Saturday, at 7:00 p.m. at Jongno Picadilly. Jung-hwan, want to come? Never! I'm just joking, you bastard! I'm just joking too, you bastard! {\an8}Apparently, the cat isn't the only thing that comes back. {\an8}MARCH, 1989 SSANGMUN, DOBONG, SEOUL This came back too. NATIONAL SINGING COMPETITION: DOBONG -National! -Singing Competition! Mi-ran. Should we compete again? No! It's way too embarrassing! No one remembers us. Who would remember who lost in the preliminaries? -Yeah, right? -Of course! Wow. It's already been four or five years. Back then, I think we weren't all there. Seriously... why did I do that? We're not the ones at fault. It's that thing's fault. NATIONAL SINGING COMPETITION PRELIMINARIES {\an8}FIVE YEARS AGO, 1984 Number 242! Number 242, please come in! Wait, you have to take this! Geez. Sun-young, I'm so nervous. Can I have a shot too? That's good. Oh, my. My arm is shaking. What do I do? Oh, my God. Aren't you nervous? Wow, you're so strong. That's much better. Here, have a shot. She's not nervous. -Is it Kaoliang liquor? -When did you pack it? -Use the cup here! -Be careful. What are you doing? -Can I have some? -Oh, my. Number 245! Number 245, please come in! Number 247! Number 247! I'm going... I don't think one bottle was enough... Long, long ago, a long time ago Number 257! Number 257, please come inside! Do we have The Wild Dogs who will sing "Butterfly Girl"? Wild Dogs? Over here! We're here. We... we're here. Il-hwa, let's go. Over here! Here... over here! Long, long ago, a long time ago A pretty girl... Oh, my. Come by the hospital later. Seong-gyun is fine. Back surgery is still a big deal. It's a relief, really. Relief? Why his back, of all places? Grab some soju on your way. Okay. Mi-ran, cheer up! Something good is bound to happen soon! Sure... HANKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL Geez. I heard that even the dogs over on Yeouido's Wall Street are walking around with 100,000 won bills in their jaws. The stock prices are crazy these days. They've gone up so much! Can I have the crackers? I guess your diet isn't restricted. Nope. Walking is a pain, but I can eat whatever I want. Shouldn't we all buy some stocks? Mr. Sung, should I buy some stocks? What do you think? I wanted to ask you too. I was thinking of investing some money... Yes, good idea! Please, do it! You're going to be buried with all that money. You can invest all you want. All you do is save. Would it be safe? I'm scared. Of course it's okay! My friend pointed out three good ones. If we keep them for 20-30 years, we can have our kids' weddings at a hotel. We can even send our grandchildren overseas to study! Which ones are they? -Oh, they are... -No, no. That's not right. The time to buy stocks is over right now. The share prices have gone up way too much. How can it break 1,000 points? What that means is you buy them at shoulder prices to sell them at knee-level amounts! So stock prices had head, shoulders, knees... Knees and toes Head, shoulders, knees, ear, nose, and ear Is that right? Why didn't you get brain surgery while they were at it? But everyone with some money invests in stocks. Mr. Choi, just invest your money elsewhere. Trust me. My friend told me... what were they? Samsung Electric, Hanmi Pharmaceuticals, and Amore Pacific. He said we have to buy those stocks. How much are their shares? I saw them in the newspaper today. They were about 20,000 to 30,000 won. Oh, my... That's so expensive. They've gone up a lot. Exactly. Prices have risen way too much! I'm telling you, they're done for. They can't possibly go up any more! So, just put your money in the bank. I'll get you an account with a 17 percent interest rate. Just listen to me. Okay? Put it in the bank. Okay. Thank you. -Where? -The bank. -Where? -The bank. Okay. Go home now. I'll get an earful if my dad sees us. I'll call you. Don't forget. If it only rings twice, it's me. Twice, yes. Then, I'll see you next Monday, on your birthday. I know that you have a school anniversary and don't have school. How did you know my birthday? By the powers of interest. What? One day, I developed this strange power that lets me read people's minds. When you're really in love, you develop supernatural powers! You can smile big. You look more beautiful with a big smile. Mi-ok, do you like cornet bread? What is that? I baked you one. Here. Want another one? I've been practicing. Cornet bread! Take them home. I wish I could. You can. Doesn't it hurt? Not at all. You look so uncomfortable. Her favorite color is yellow. Favorite season is winter. Favorite food is fried white bread. Favorite subject is none. -Slow down a bit. -Okay. Her birthday is April 3rd. Oh, it's coming up soon. What would she like? Nothing tangible. She has everything. Something from the heart. Girls like that. Something from the heart? I'm going to the hospital-- What is that? Oh, nothing. You don't have to do that. You're dating Deok-sun's friend. Did Dong-ryong tell you? No, he doesn't know who I'm dating. Deok-sun told me. Dong-ryong knows too? It happened that way. Geez... What are those paper cranes? What are they for? Do you know the legend of the paper cranes? Do I have to? No. I just want to tell you. If you fold 1,000 of these tiny paper cranes, they become real cranes, and fly away. And they grant the wish of the one who folded them. I see. Ms. Mi-ok's birthday is in a week. Ms. Mi-ok? What's up with "Miss"? Just speak informally. It's too soon for that. I want to move at a slower pace. I'm going to fold 1,000 of these for her birthday. And then, I'll ask her what her wish is, and grant it, no matter what. What if it's a weird wish? I will still grant it, no matter what it is. Wow, you really are a romantic. Give it to me. I'll help you. You call that a crane? I only know how to fold an airplane. Who's that? Me? It's you and me. You want to become a pilot, right? When you become a pilot, I'll be your first passenger. Your very first one. It'll be a fighter jet. I want to be a fighter pilot. Since... when? HANKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL That hurts! Be gentle! Don't be a wimp. Mi-ran, I heard the National Singing Competition is back in town. How did you find out? Yesterday, the dean-- I mean, Mr. Ryu, came by. A lot of students are auditioning too. I have no luck. I wanted to partake in that competition. I don't have to go to the main one. I just wanted to show what I have. Why did my back have to break now? Yeah. You practiced with Deok-sun before to compete some day. Mi-ran, I have one wish. No more kids! No, not that. Something easier than that. What is it? You're a decent dancer. Why don't you compete for me? You practiced so much five years ago, but couldn't compete due to food poisoning. We don't know when they'll be back. Go and compete. It's my wish! Okay? With your skills, you can make it through the preliminaries. No. You're hurt. When would I prepare? I won't. You're good at lots of songs. No need to prepare. You'll get through the preliminaries, for sure! Apply now. Should I do Yun Soo-il? "A Thrilling Confession"? Sounds good! You'll make it without question! A little something for you. Oh wow. You're already in a study group? Cram school too? I got a late start, so I have to catch up. Let's get together on Friday. At 11:00 p.m., at the stairs. It's okay. You have a lot to prepare... I can wait. It's okay. I'll leave the library to meet you then. Okay. Good night. Okay. Sleep well. Okay. Sleep tight. What? Bo-ra will? Really? So you're going to become a judge, then? She can become a judge, or a prosecutor, or a lawyer! That's her dream. -Is she going to a temple to study? -No, silly! She's not becoming a monk! It's not the 70's anymore. The hostels are really great these days. She's going to live in one, starting next month. Really? What will we do? I'm going to miss you. So, that room is all mine now? Aw, yes! I'll be back for the weekends! Hey. You'll be crying every night about how much you miss her. Just wait. What? Don't say such terrible things. There's no way that'll happen. Don't you have another shirt? Why did you buy such a small one? The buttons will pop. What are you saying? This is my exact size-- It popped off. A tight fit is in style now! I'll wash up. Okay. Stop it, little... It fell somewhere here. -How far did it go? -This will pop too. I want to go to the study room in April. Mom, can I go to cram school? All the other kids are going. Deok-sun, how about May, instead of April? We have lots of expenses in April for Bo-ra's hostel and moving. All the other kids already enrolled. By the way, No-eul, I'm getting a bonus next month. In May, I'll send you to at least one cram school. Just wait until next month, okay? -Thank you for the meal. -Okay. Couldn't sleep last night? You look terrible. I'm okay, Dad. I can sleep during the day. You made all this? No. Sun-young brought all of this over. I just set the table. She works too hard for us. Is it okay for us to keep mooching? That's why I always thank her. Just with your words? Um... Taek. Well... Nothing. Eat. What is it? Tell me, Dad. It's nothing. Never mind. I'll tell you next time. Eat all of that. SSANGMUN HIGH DOSHIRAK RAMEN Did you guys submit your Future Aspirations forms? They're due by today. I'm aiming for law at Seoul University. Crazy bastard. They're "aspirations." I can write whatever I want. Do whatever you want. Your dad will be reading it anyway. He earns his beatings. Yeah. I feel more sorry for the dean nowadays. Are you ready for tonight? Just once, okay? Where are you going? Deko. Deko? You mean, at the Tower Hotel? There's a dance-off? Do you know what the first-place prize is? What? A Hyundai Excel! That's a different level! National competitions are different. You know, I'm not a bad dancer myself. What kind of dance is that? Hey, who breakdances nowadays, anyway? I've changed it up a bit lately. Geez. That's so old. You just ride a motorcycle, so you don't know anything about dance trends. Nowadays... Hip-hop is the way to go. Don't waste all your energy now. Wait a minute. You're number 13? That'll be a while. I heard all of the big shots are coming today. Yeah. Deko is the Yeouido kids' turf. There's a girl named Kim Song-yi from Yeouido Girl's High. And she's really good. You're pretty good yourself. You'll get third, at least. Won't it be hard? The kids from Gangnam and Itaewon are here. Are you kidding? I'm Park Nam-jeong from Ssangmun. He is! Yeouido and Itaewon are bigger than Ssangmun. My friends, do you know what I'm most worried about? What? What I will do when I get the Excel. I stole my older brother's ID, but I'll be in trouble if I win. It's starting. I'm hungry though. Let's watch the first round and get some ramen. They won't be good. Let's go. Okay. DEKO NIGHTCLUB NATIONAL DANCE OFF It won't work. Hey. If he had gone earlier, he would've been totally humiliated! What was the name of the first contestant? Hyun Jin-young. That guy danced like an American! The second guy's name was Jin-young too. -Oh, yeah. Park Jin-young. -Right. He totally danced like an American too! Did you memorize their names? Congratulations on being so smart. Where are you going? To Taek's. Let's go watch Dirty Dancing. What? Wait up! SSANGMUN GIRLS' HIGH {\an8}FUTURE ASPIRATION FORM COLLEGES AND MAJORS Joey. Joey Wong. Yeah? What do you want to be? Me? A hairdresser. Oh, my. Your perm came out so nicely. Young lady! Your perm came out nicely! Sloth, get up! Your perm came out so nicely! Get up and look! Miss. The teacher wants you. She wants four million won for using the school as a hotel. I should just pull it all out. What about you? What do you want to be? That's not what it is asking. It's which college you'll apply to. I know! I'm just asking. Also, I have no college to write down. Are you leaving tomorrow? Let's watch somewhere else. It's okay. I'll take a short break. Guys, I told you to wait for me. Jung-hwan. If you had watched Dirty Dancing instead of Top Gun, we could've taken the same path. Wouldn't you want to be a dancer after seeing his dance? I didn't decide to become a fighter pilot after seeing Top Gun. What do you take me for? Just being real. You've wanted to be a soccer player like Maradona since elementary school. He loved Michael Jordan in middle school, so he wanted to be a basketball player. Did I? There are no secrets here. You're lucky you saw Top Gun. If you'd seen Come Come Come Upward, you would've shaved your head and wanted to become a monk. That's why you have to dream big, like me. Appearing in the newspaper with huge headlines? Of course. I'll become more famous than Taek. Have you decided? Yeah. I'll to go to medical school. Why? Are you following Michol there? It's my mom's wish. I don't hate the idea. And I'm not passionate about anything else. Showoff! You're going to medical school because of that? Crazy bastard. Why do I hang out with crazy bastards... I suddenly want to see Deok-sun. Deok-sun, where are you? Can you hear me? Baseball fans, you've been waiting a long time. The 1989 Major League season officially starts today, April 8th. Today kicks off as many as 420 games. Opening games will be in three places: Haitai, Binggrae, and Gwangju. Reigning champs Haitai still have Sun Dong-yol, Kim Sung-hwan, and Lee Seung-chul, and they've also recruited Jo Gye-hyun and Lee Gang-chul, hoping for another stellar season this year. The bottom team, the Pacific Dolphins, have hired famous coach, Kim Sung-goon, from OB, proclaiming they won't finish last this year... We have to do the annual bet this year too. Hey, why is the patient drinking? We're going to drink it all, so don't worry! Well, it's fine. I have a catheter in. Gross. Oh yeah. We should bet 50,000 won again. Mr. Kim won that last year, after betting on Haitai. You sure don't know how to appreciate the beauty of competition. How could they not win with Sun Dong-yol, Lee Seung-chul, and Kim Sung-hwan? They'll do well, even in the Major League. Let's leave Haitai out of our bets this time. Leave them out, and bet on the rest. How about that? I think the Pacific Dolphins are going to stir up baseball this year. They were the worst last year. They have Coach Kim Sung-goon on board this year! The top four teams go on to the playoffs this year. They'll make it to the playoffs. Hey, Mr. Kim, did you get back surgery or brain surgery? How can you be so romantic about baseball? How could the Pacific Dolphins make it to the semifinals? Yes, they will. I can feel it. All right, let's bet on that then! Whether or not they'll make it to the playoffs. Okay? -I'll bet that they will make it. -Me too. Then, I'll bet that they won't. If I win, I get the entire pot. -Yes. -All right. Let's bet on it. Yes, turn like that! So fun! Wow, amazing! She'll win. Yes! Oh, my God. Seriously. You should sing too, not just dance! Yeah, she's right! Get the instrumental! Start practicing your singing too! Don't talk if you don't know. Preliminaries are all about unique talents or dancing. Why are you being such amateurs? Mr. Ryu said he would find me the instrumental. I'll practice singing with that. Isn't this tape a bit stretched out? You've listened to it way too many times! -Right? -Yeah. I'll buy a new one. What? What do you need? Jung-bong, that's not food. Mother, if you remove it in 15 minutes, you can enjoy the good sound again. Wow. You're so smart. -Seriously. -I'll go now. There's nothing that he doesn't know! Right? He's on his seventh attempt at college. I wish he knew how to answer exam questions and not that stuff. Hey, I can't see! Move out of the way. It's 11:00 p.m. Night sessions are over. Time to go home. -Me too. -Bye. Bye. Bye. Hey! Why are you guys coming out from there? Did you cut the night sessions? Mom! Are you a dog or a human? Freak! Why would you bite someone? Bye. Me too. See you tomorrow. What are these? Oh, nice plump bread! Bye, IWESS. Who are you calling IWESS? Come in. I brought some goldfish bread. Thanks. You guys watched a video? A perverted one? No. We watched Dirty Dancing. We couldn't even watch all of it. I'm being honest. When do you leave tomorrow? On the evening flight. Okay. Have a safe trip. Oh, yeah. You said Saturday, right? Don't forget again. I'll call you after my match on Friday. Chief Lee and Mr. Yoo are going, right? Yes, they're both coming. Don't worry. Why would I? Deok-sun. Can you give this to Jung-hwan? He left it here. After he told me off for forgetting stuff. Geez. I'm off, Master Choi! Bye! Bye. Bye! Hey, Jung-hwan! Your wallet! You left it at Taek's! Oh, yeah. Thanks. The chopstick pattern! Dang. She's not dead, is she? She's breathing. What's all this? This is a nutritional supplement, and this is a vitamin. This is good for your eyes. Take these. I have a lot at home. Does your dad run a pharmacy? Is your dad a pharmacist? No. He bought them for me. He says I need to keep up my stamina. He said if I'm not well-fed, I won't be able to study. Aren't you too well-fed? You eat ten pieces of bread a day. You'll be in trouble if you fail. Aren't your brothers in college? What will you do? Didn't you place 1,300th? What do you take me for? I am better than that! I'm at 1,280th place. My dad told me to look forward to my birthday morning. I feel like a fleet of tutors will be coming over. -Tutoring won't help you that much. -Hey. Okay. I made a big mistake. Bye. All you got is power. THURSDAY MATH, MUSIC Aw, yes! Music! Teacher! It's time for Music, not Korean Language. SELF-STUDY Quiet. Starting today, you'll self-study in Music, French, Home Economics, and PE. You're seniors now. You have to study. Open your books and study. -Oh, no. -Kids! It may be hard now, but as you get older and have kids, you'll look back and realize how beautiful this time was. No way! Yeah. Of course. You probably don't understand what a great time in your life this actually is. How would you guys know? Study! Quiet! Let's study, all right? LEE SEO-HYUN What's this? Did we learn this? Why are you solving that? I've never seen that before. Is that just a doodle? Drawing... Was it a drawing? We had to bring our recorder, right? Damn. I didn't bring mine! I brought mine. You practiced hard, Nam-hyuk? I'll just take the punishment. Okay. Next. Geez. Hitting you guys is wearing me out. Hey, just sing a song and take a seat. Excuse me? Hurry up. Teacher, please just hit me instead. My arm hurts! Hurry up and sing something. -Shall I borrow something? -Sing! Sing! -Hey. -Sing! Our expectations aren't high, so just sing. Okay, applaud! Taek hasn't left yet, right? No. He's studying in his room. What's this? I made some abalone porridge. I got my paycheck yesterday. So I bought some fresh abalone in the market. Feed this to him before he leaves. You can microwave the leftovers after putting them in the fridge. Give it to him while it's still warm. Oh, my. Thank you. Taek skipped breakfast and lunch, and he was going to skip dinner, so I wasn't sure what I should feed him. This is great. Yeah. Why don't you eat with us? Bring Jin-ju too. No, that's okay. Bye. Well... Taek. I have something to say. Dad, I'm not a kid. It's okay. Just tell me. Okay. I... wish I had a good friend by my side, like the ones that you have. I haven't decided on anything... I... want to be good friends with Sun-woo's mom. As someone to talk to... I'd like to spend the remainder of my life with her. But Taek... If you don't like it... I won't become friends with her. I wouldn't... want you to you feel uncomfortable. Yeah. This is... well... something that I've been thinking about alone. Nothing has been decided yet. It's just that... I... wanted to talk to you first to get your permission. I won't... do anything against your will. I promise. Dad, I want you to have a warm meal, even when I'm not here with you. It's your life, Dad. I want you to be happy. If it'll make you happy, then I'm fine with it all. Finish your food. Okay. Mom! What time is it? Let's see... It's 7:50-- You're late. How can you even think about joking around right now? -Grow up, already! -You're late too. Don't yell at me. Hey. Your bag. Thank you. Hey. Let me have a bite. -What's your blood type? -Never mind. Here. Taek must be in China by now. What's your plan? For tomorrow? Saturday? I might meet Taek. Taek has to win today, right? What are you saying? Stop doing that to him. How can he always win? He can lose too. He'll win today, for sure. -Here, hand me your bag. -Thanks. You think Taek is good at Go-game because he's smart? That may be true. But there's another reason. What? His competitive nature. He's incredibly competitive. We have two fiercely competitive people. Jung-bong. He's the type to fight to the finish too. Kim Jung-bong and Choi Taek. There is a famous story. The Galaga War. Before Jung-bong fell for Bubble Bobble, he was crazy about Galaga. He went to the arcade every day back then, and had mini turf wars with elementary schoolers. It was shameful. I ended up not seeing him for awhile. But he managed to get his name on the top of the leaderboard. GALAGA 50 WON PER GAME NO TWO-PLAYER GAMES TOP FIVE FIRST: J.B. Give me your bag. Thank you. Then, one day, he went to the arcade, and someone had beaten his high score. He made sure he was on top before he went home the night before. So, he went to the arcade early the next morning. {\an8}TOP FIVE FIRST: C.T. SECOND: J.B. DAEKWANG ARCADE When Taek has time, he has a lot of it. I guess he had a lot of time then. That was the day of the Guksu Competition. Crazy bastard. Me? Not me, right? I'm talking about Choi Taek. He really is! He can't settle for second place. Tenacious bastard. What's tenacious about that? He's just immature. Regardless, he'll win today, for sure. He has a goal. Since he has something to work for, he'll win today. You watch. ING CUP THIRD MATCH {\an8}HAILUN HOTEL, SHANGHAI, CHINA ING CUP THIRD MATCH It's nice of Mr. Ryu to get you the instrumental. I know. But how will I show my face around here if I lose to his son? -Dong-ryong is competing too? -Yeah. He's singing a pop song. Don't worry. This competition is all about dancing. Pop songs won't stand a chance. Don't you worry. You'll beat him. I'm playing it. Neon-- You missed it again! You have to be on time. I wasn't too far off. You were! You have to stay on beat. Ow. Mi-ran, it's time. I have to pee. -Geez, is it urgent? -Wait. It's going to come out! -Ow! Ow! -Geez. It's coming out! BONGHWANGDANG Oh, you're here? Oh, no. Give her to me. I got it. It's okay. Let's go. I'll tuck her in. Oh, my. Did you hear from Taek? Not yet. I'm sure I will, though. It's cold. Go in. You too. Okay. Well... Sun-young. Yes? What is it? Nothing. Never mind. I'll get going then. Mi-ran, brush my teeth! Your tape stretched out. You must've listened to it a lot. What do we do? Isn't tomorrow the preliminaries? Where will we get a new one? -Just wait. -Huh? That's nothing. My wife is a genius. Go in. I made your bed. No. I'm going to watch the late news. Isn't today the knockout match for Taek at the Ing Cup? Hello? It's me. Mi-ok. Yes, I know. Did your night session end well? Yes. Deok-sun is home now too, right? I don't know. I'm sure she is though. I don't care. What did you say? Nothing. Is your father sleeping? Is it okay for us to talk? Yes, he just went to work. I mean, he went to see someone. -Don't forget our meeting on Monday. -Okay. I'll happily wait at the bus stop outside your house at 2:00 p.m.! I have to eat breakfast and spend time with my family for my birthday, so I might be a bit late-- Hello? Who are you, bastard? Huh? Dad! I'm back from school! I'm home. -I'm home. -I'm back from school, and so is the dean. Shut it, bastard! I'm not a dean anymore. Yes, Sir. Wow. Well, it's already April. Bo-ra isn't home yet? She studies in the library til after midnight these days. This will be the last night she comes home at all, let alone late. Oh, right. Come straight home after you're done with work tomorrow. You have to see her off, at least. Hey, it's not like she's immigrating. She's just moving to a hostel. There's no need for all of us to be there. So chaotic. I'll be busy tomorrow at work. I might not make it. Just so you know. It's not a big deal... Mom, you bought new blankets? Yeah... she's moving out. I can't give her old blankets. I want to eat out with her and get her some herbal medicine, but... Geez. Did he win or lose? Why isn't he calling? It's over. You may come in. Who's the winner? Choi Taek? Or Chang Hao? Congratulations. Korea won this time too. Choi Taek, 6-dan, won. Aw, yes! We won, right? -Yes. -Yes! Thank you. Competitive match and... Choi Taek has finally won the Ing Cup. At the third match of the finals in Shanghai, China, Korea's Choi Taek, 6-dan, playing against Chang Hao, 9-dan, built three more houses than his opponent, and secured a victory. These two players hit it hard in the beginning. At first, Choi Taek was in a disadvantageous situation, but made a bold move... Hello? Is this Deok-sun? Yeah, it's me, Taek. Deok-sun. Bo-ra.
