 You smell like alcohol. Oh, dear, who made this one? Who else? Dong-il did. Who would believe you're in high school with all of this baby fat? Let's see if you have a wiener. -Oh, my little child! -Mom, stop Dad! Seriously, let me sleep! Sung Deok-sun. It's Sung Soo-yeon. Here, you wanted to listen to this. No? Never mind, then. No, give it to me. Did he fall asleep?

 I have to pee. Okay, Jin-ju, let's go pee. Hey, what took you so long? Sorry, Bo-ra. My mom went to sleep late. Is Soo-yeon asleep? Yeah, she wouldn't wake up, even if someone kidnapped her. Is your mom asleep? Yes. Jin-ju too? Yes, she's sleeping next to me. You sleep with Jin-ju? No. She woke up to pee. Then she wanted to sleep with me, so I brought her over. You're a good person. What are you doing tomorrow? Do you want to check out a movie tomorrow? Check out? You're being so informal lately. Can't I be, just a little, since we're dating? Can't I? Okay, fine. I'm sorry. The block is so quiet tonight. I think everyone's asleep. I'm sure, it's late. Hey, bro. Jung-hwan. It's snowing outside. So? Let's sleep together. I feel so lonely. What's wrong with you? Don't touch there. Let's sleep together. It's been a while. Come on, bro. Bo-ra, it's snowing. So what? Come out. I'll wait outside your house. Hey, Sun-woo. Hey! Where are you going? The bathroom. Go back to sleep. Are you out of your mind? Nobody's watching. Bo-ra? Sis. Where did she go at this hour? Does No-eul sleepwalk? Why did he suddenly come out? I'll take care of him tomorrow. Hurry up and go home or else we'll meet everyone on the block. Bye. Hey. Wait. Who would come out at this hour? Everyone's asleep now. You take care of him. My precious friend, Taek. This is a secret. It's a secret, okay? Okay. Sun-woo. Aren't you afraid of Bo-ra? No, not at all. She's cute. Crazy bastard. You know words like that? Where did you learn that? Who taught you curse words? It's a secret. Crazy bastard. Put more oomph into it. Crazy bastard. Crazy bastard. All right, next. This asshole. This asshole. Good, you've gotten better. What are you two doing? Way to teach him good stuff. That's not it. He lent an upperclassman ten million won again. What? That crazy son-of-a-bitch, motherfucking fuck. Teach him how to chew a blade. How will you survive in this cruel world? Are you a pushover? You're so frustrating. Repeat after me. No. No. Why should I? Why should I? No way. Freaking pissing me off. No way. Freaking pissing me off. What are you doing? Cursing. That was horrible. What are you doing? -I'm leaving. -Where are you going? I promised to watch a video with Jung-bong. Just wait. I have a gift for all of you bastards. Ta-da! DDOCHI WESTERN FOOD COUPON Ddochi Western Food? What's that? A pork cutlet place. My brother gave it to me. -Geum-ryong? -Yes. His friend opened a Western restaurant. My older brother is being nice, for once. When can we go? This weekend? Is everyone free? The coupon's not valid on weekends. It only works on weekdays. Let's go Tuesday. We're back in school next Tuesday. We can go for dinner. It's near Ssangmun Station, on the first floor of the shopping plaza. It's between our school and Soo-yeon's, so we can eat and go home. -You gonna go? -Sure. I have matches Monday and Tuesday. Until when? Nine o'clock. If it ends early, I'll join. Don't overwork yourself. And you? Oh, I... Hey... they say their part-time waitress looks like Lee Mi-yeon. -You'll come? -I have to, then. Sun-woo, I'm taking Jin-ju to the market. I'll go with you. It's okay. Stay home and study. I can go by myself. No, it'll be too heavy. Hang on, I'll come. It's really fine, though. Bye. How much is a bag of bean sprouts? Three hundred won. Give me 100 won discount. I'll pay 200 won. Not again. How could I take 100 won off of 300 won? Fine. Pack it for me, quickly. Why are you giving up so easily today? -You haven't worked me down 50 won-- -Hurry. Mom. Yeah? How much was it again, 300 won? Yes. -Are you making bean sprout soup? -Yeah, it's cold today. It will be good with spicy pepper. Hey, can you take Jin-ju and go home? I have to pick up the sesame oil. -Let's go together. -No, it's okay, Jin-ju must be cold. I also want to chat a bit with the ladies. Okay. I have to change the briquette, right? That's right. Don't buy anything else. Your wrist will hurt. Okay. If you buy something heavy, leave it here. I'll come back for it. Okay. Go. Jin-ju is going to catch a cold. Okay, let's go, Jin-ju. -Mommy, bye. -Bye, Jin-ju. Gosh, your son is so nice. He is such a breath of fresh air. You must be so happy. You've got such a great son. Take off 100 won. What? Give me a 100 won discount. No, we already agreed on 300 won. I was just in a hurry because of my son. Come on, just 100 won off. Just 50 won, then? Give me 50 won off, then. Please. Ieung, ah. Good. Nieun, ahn. Ieung, ah. E. Se. {\an8}HELLO Yo. Jin-ju, wait. From now on, you have to write the verb... with an s not an o. Siot. Jin-ju doesn't know the Korean alphabet yet. She's just copying what you wrote. Mom, do you have a cold? No, I'm fine. It's about to come. Sun-woo, try this. How does it taste? It's good, right? -Yeah. -What, too salty? Is it not good? A little salty, but it will be good with rice. Really? I added extra salt to make it go with rice. Clear the table. Let's eat. -Jin-ju, let's eat. -Should I add more salt? No, Mom, it's great now. -Really? -Yeah. Isn't Dad working late again? Why are you making so much rice? I wanted to make this much. It's good to have extra rice. I have to bring those. They have to eat that with their meal. -Soo-yeon. -What? Can you run an errand for me? Take these to Jung-hwan's. They must already be eating dinner. -Okay. -Come right back, okay? Bring some to Sun-woo's too. Why do I have to do everything? Am I your only child? I'll go. Give it to me, I'll take it to Sun-woo's. Which, this one? She might need to see a doctor. I think she's gone crazy. I must be out of my mind. Oh, my God, I must be crazy. Dang it. Hello, it's me, Soo-yeon! Hi, Deok-sun. She's Soo-yeon. Soo-yeon. My mom wanted you to have this. Wow, she made so many! -Did your father get paid? -No. What are you doing? Eating, obviously. Soo-yeon, can't you be Deok-sun again? Soo-yeon. I prefer calling you Deok-sun. Deok-sun suits you better. It's Soo-yeon. If you keep calling me that, there's no chance I'll succeed. Soo-yeon! I hope things go well for you. Soo-yeon, would you like to eat here? I made spicy sea squirts. I'd love to! Soo-yeon, I'll be yours forever. Jingle! Thank you. I know, all right? I know, all right? My mom wanted you to have this. Oh, Bo-ra. Okay, tell her that I said thank you. -Okay. -Wait. I have a question for you. Just a moment. Yeah, Bo-ra, help Sun-woo with his studies. I can't pay much, but I'll give you some pocket money. You don't have socks on. -Aren't you cold? -Are you insane? What if we get caught? We won't. Sit down. No, I'm leaving. Hey, do you have a death wish? Fine. My break ends tomorrow. I know. I'll stop by on my way to school tomorrow. No. I'll go to the library early morning. Early in the morning? Why? I have my reasons. You don't need to know. You're on break though. Are you... going to exercise? No, I'm really going to study. I'm off. Let's meet after my night session, in front of your place, around 11:00 p.m. I can't. -Bo-ra! -Be quiet. Why can't you? No-eul is on to us. Meeting in front of my house is risky. How about the food truck on the road at 11:00 p.m.? Study hard, student. Okay, I will. Here, eat this. I think Sun-woo is lightheaded. He might need medicine. Goodbye. Are you ill? -Huh? -Are you dizzy? -No. -You need medicine? -No, I'm fine. -Huh? I'm fine, really. Mister, I'm leaving. Okay. What time are you going to school tomorrow morning? I don't know... early. Okay. I'm really leaving now. Soo-yeon, be careful on your way home. Your house is far. -Jung-bong. -Huh? Did you write a reply? Yeah. I went to the post office and sent it the fastest way. I could get a reply by tomorrow. What's this all about? You don't need to know. I'll tell you some other time. Something great happened to me. My heart is pounding already. It's on the other side. Son, wake up! Your break is over. You have to go to school. What time is it? It's already 6:30 a.m. Go and wash up. Wake your sister up too. She's now a senior in high school. She should get up on her own. How much longer do we have to wake her up? That girl doesn't have a care in the world. Sis, wake-- What, you're ready to go? Yeah, I'm a senior now. Soo-yeon is off to school now. Oh, Deok-- I mean, Soo-yeon. You're going to school early. Where is Jung-hwan? -Jung-hwan? -Yes. He already left. Excuse me? Jung-hwan must be aiming for Harvard. He left very early. Dang it. {\an8}SAY HELLO SSANGMUN GIRLS' HIGH VOCABULARY SUMMARY -Hi. -Yeah. Something totally crazy happened yesterday. -What? Did you get rejected again? -No. Hey, what would be so crazy about that? Happens all the time. You're right. Then what happened? I went to a Western restaurant with my family yesterday. A new place next to the subway station. It's called Ddochi or Douner-- I'm going there next week. I have a coupon. Hey, be careful there. I saw a flasher there. A flasher? Yeah, it was so gross. I've never seen one. For real? Seriously? I'm the only one in our class who hasn't seen one. You sound so disappointed. If you actually saw one, you would pass out. Were you okay? I see them pretty often, so, yeah. He looked so cold. I told him, "Mister, go home it's cold," and sent him off. Wow, Joey Wong, you're incredible. It's nothing. But the first time I saw one, I was so surprised. My heart started pounding and I cried. That bad? I would get an autograph. Yeah, that's you. How about skipping study hall and going to Brazil Tteok-bokki? I can't. Starting today, I'm studying hard. I'll go to college too. Isn't it too late for that? The moment you think it's too late-- Is really too late. It's good, so nice and sweet. Now that the kids are back in school, it's so quiet here. Our vacation has just begun. All the kids are gone, only Jin-ju is here. Hello. Where are you going? Outside for a bit. Jung-bong. Come over here. Go to the arcade or something. Thank you. Have a great time, then. I have to see him go to college before I die. Geez, you're being greedy. You used to say, all you want is for him to be healthy. Yeah, Jung-bong is such a nice boy. What other guys at his age don't cause any trouble? He's fine, really. Did you catch a cold? Not yet. Geez, buy yourself some medicine, silly. All I need is a cup of citron tea. You're going to work again today? What time? Same time. I have to be there by 8:30 p.m., when it closes. You'll eventually get caught. What if Sun-woo finds out? How would he find out? He comes home at 11:00 p.m., after the night session. I finish work at 10:30 p.m. I'll never get caught. By the way, where's the little princess Jin-ju? She made a new friend recently. So later, when I go to work, I'll leave her with her friend. -Who's her friend? -There's a kid who is at her exact level. Jin-ju, wait a minute. I'm almost done. All done. Here you go. Jin-ju. What's wrong, Jin-ju? -The shoulders. -The shoulders? Oh, wait a minute. Oh, no, I'll put them back on. Wait a minute. Don't cry. I'll take care of these for you. The shoulders. I just have to cut them out before I stick them back on. Hold on, okay? Mister! Is there a letter for Kim Jung-bong? Kim Jung-bong? At the house with the blue gate. No, nothing. I have nothing for you. You don't? You really don't? Soo-yeon is a senior now. She really needs to come to her senses and start studying. Put some faith in that shaman, even though she was wrong about Jung-bong. It's not like she got mine right, either. You never know, she has to be right, eventually. Soo-yeon, please study. It's your mother's wish. CHAPTER 1. UNIONS AND VENN DIAGRAMS It hurts. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES SSANGMUN HIGH -Let's hurry to Taek's. -What is that? I have something to do. Bye. Hey, Sun-- Why is he always leaving us? It's an X-rated film. I paid Michol 10,000 won to borrow it. Taek has a match tomorrow, so we have to support him and whatnot. Studying isn't everything. You have to experience and feel with your body, bastards-- I'm gonna watch Die Hard with Jung-bong. Please, go home. I really don't want to see the dean at home tonight. Let's go home! I AM PROUD OF MY DAD Were you waiting long? Ten minutes? From now on, let's meet ten minutes later. I came as fast as I could, but I'm still late. So, from now on, let's meet at 11:10 p.m., okay? Okay, we can just agree on sometime around eleven. I don't want you to be waiting when it's cold out. -Do you want udon? -Yeah. Can we have two udons? Okay! Let's eat and go home, your mom must be waiting. Still, I want to be with you. Have this, I don't like chrysanthemums. You're pickier than Jin-ju. You have to eat everything, so you get taller and healthy. Stop messing around. Bo-ra. Why have you been going to the library lately? Preparing for your teacher's exam? What time do you study until? Are you studying math or something else as well? You have so many questions. Do you really want to know that much about me? Of course, that's how people are. You're the weird one. I don't like secrets. You keep speaking casually. Ma'am. But seriously, what are you up to lately? Geez... really? I'm going to see Taek for a bit. I've been studying accounting. Why? Are you taking the CPA exam, not the teacher's exam? I was blacklisted by the Seoul Police Department. It'll be hard for me to become a teacher. An upperclassman suggested a part-time job to me. It's an accounting firm, so I'm studying. They'll pay more than I make tutoring. If I like the job, I can apply for a full-time position. So, I'm a bit busy nowadays. For the time being, I don't have much time to see you. Then, why not just study for the CPA exam? Not just anyone can become a CPA. You have to study like crazy for years. If I start that, you and I would be over. I can't do both things at once. Consider yourself lucky. Can we still see each other every night? Only on weekends. For now, we'll meet on weekends. You're a senior too. I don't want your grades to drop because of me. I'll take care of my studies. No! Only on weekends. Your dad? He's asleep. We should watch with the others. I have to give it back tomorrow. Who else will take care of his friends' sex lives, other than me? Thank me. Let's put this in, Taek. Taek, my mom wanted you-- -Hey! -What is that? -It's porn, right? -No, Deok-sun! No! Mister! Good job, Taek. No, you can't, Deok-sun! No, you can't... No... Deok-sun. That's not it. Son of a bitch! Are you upset? -Nope. -Nope? Speaking casually again? -Why can't I? -"Why"? Ma'am? You can't. Don't be disrespectful. Aren't we dating? Ma'am? Am I just a little kid to you? You always treat me like a kid. Yeah, this is just a one-way romance. Whatever, stop spouting nonsense. Let's go, it's late. How much was it? It's 1,400 won. Let's go. Goodbye. Hurry up. She's toying with me. Bo-ra! -You wore that skirt for me, didn't you? -Shut up. -Aren't you cold? The skirt looks cold. -It's cold. Oh, my God! Stop it. A flasher? Those who wear big coats and flash people? Apparently they pop up near the Ddochi Restaurant. -Let's go somewhere else, then. -No, I need to use the coupon. It's okay. What's so scary about a flasher? I want to see one. -Aren't you scared? -No. You really think she'd be scared of that? She's only scared of Bo-ra. Don't be silly. What's that sound? Do you guys hear that? Mice. My dad put out a few traps and sticky tape, but we are both too scared to check them. We have to throw them away. Your dad looks like he'd kill them with his bare hands, but he's very humane. Mice are the only thing he fears. A mouse bit him when he was little. Where are you going? To catch mice. Let's go. I'll throw the traps out. Aw, yeah. Three of them. Three what? What is? Don't come here! Move them away! -Are you really a girl? -Stop it, Deok-sun. -My name is Soo-yeon! -Get away from me! I'll kill you. Run. Go away! No! Go away! Don't come any closer! Go away. You should reconsider. Huh? You really like her as a woman? She's cute. Come to your senses, idiot. Dang, I bit my tongue. The drizzle rain is falling quietly Sad partings at Busan Station... I'll kill them all tonight. I say goodbye and you say goodbye too My child, No-eul. -My cute child. -Damn it! Dad! Why do you keep doing that when I'm sleeping? Good morning. -Hi, Bo-ra. You're leaving early. -Yes. Wow, Seoul University students sure are different. -Hello, Mister. -Deok-sun, where are you going? I'm Soo-yeon. Oh, Soo-yeon, where are you off to at this hour? To school. Goodbye. Okay. Oh, did you see Jung-hwan leave, by any chance? No. Oh, okay. -Goodbye. -Okay, bye. She finally came to her senses in her senior year. Wait a minute. -I need a cup of coffee to wake up. -Okay. What are you doing? Why are you leaving so early? What about you? Why are you leaving so early? I'm going to sleep. Wake me up when we arrive. Sorry for the wait. We're leaving now. Jin-ju. You can't be so picky. Eat the peas too. No. I want the mackerel! Mackerel? Jin-ju, say "Ah." Jin-ju eats so well. Geez... this girl. You did catch a cold, Mom. -Did you take medicine? -I'm fine. I'll buy it later. You'll be home late? Same time as always. Buy some medicine. Okay? All right. Just take care of yourself, Sir. And now, the Go-game news. From today, the title matches begin at the Korean Go-game Club. The first match will be between Choi Taek, 6-dan who won last year, and Yoo Jin-ho, a 9-dan on a winning streak. This match has no time limit, so the players' concentration and self-maintenance are critical. As the record stands, Choi Taek won three times and lost two... Moo-sung, I'll do it. Leave it there. It's okay, I'll do it. I do this every day. -Jin-ju, you're here. -Yes. Moo-sung, where's Taek? Did he go the Go-game club already? He left early for the match today. Did you catch a cold? I'm fine. Take this when you feel a cold coming on. Boil water and add one or two spoonfuls of this. You take it. You're the one with the cold. I'm fine. Also, I'll be leaving Jin-ju with you later. Okay. Jin-ju, let's play together later. I'll cut out lots of paper dolls for you, okay? -Okay. -Yeah. Geez, girl. Dong-ryong, dinner? Yeah, I packed doshirak. DOSHIRAK INSTANT NOODLES Give me some soup. Damn, my precious noodles. Is Taek done? Our poor Taek. Why, did he lose? No, the match isn't over. Wasn't it a morning match? It started at 9:00 a.m., and it's still going. It's been ten hours. I heard the opponent is really good. What if he loses after all this time? He'll be disappointed. {\an8}YOO JIN-HO, 9-DAN CHOI TAEK, 6-DAN I think he stayed up all night. I bet he's in terrible shape. You still have indigestion? You've been sick since lunch. I can't eat dinner. Go to the bathroom. Did you throw up? A little. Go home early. Did he say you can leave? Want me to take you? It's fine, I'm leaving. TEACHER'S ROOM I've got nothing to lose. I'll try. Father, my stomach is... I ate the same thing as Sun-woo for lunch. So, I have a bit of... indigestion. I feel like throwing up. I think my farts are coming out. I'm digesting now. My farts... Can I get some medication for indigestion? Oh, and some cold medicine for sinuses. Is it for you? It's not good to take those together. The cold medicine is for my mother. Can I have one that is easy on the body? Not too strong of one. Okay. Here, Jin-ju. You're early. You still have time. She wanted to play here, so I brought her early. Okay. Have a seat for a minute before you go. -Oh, yeah, hold on. -Let's go. Wait. Let's sit. This is for you. What is it? Medicine. What? I bought yours with Taek's medicine. Wow, thanks. Give it to me. I'll open it for you. Oh, no, I'm so clumsy. You should dye your hair a little. You're growing a lot of white hairs. Who cares? I am getting old. What about your age? You're only in your 40s. Although your face is a little... You should laugh more. Jin-ju... it's funny, right? So cold. Okay, let's go. Jin-ju, say goodbye. Say thank you. Thank you. Bye. See you. You waited for me? Let's go. Thank you, Mr. Yoo. Be careful on your way home. You have a match at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow. He's going to pass out. Mom, I'm home! Sun-woo! Welcome home, my son. You're hungry? No, I ate with my friends. Did you eat tteok-bokki? Yeah, that and some other things. Is that so? I can make kimchi stew or something. No, it's okay. Did you eat? Of course. I'm getting fat. -What about Jin-ju? -She's asleep. The first match took place today in the Korean Go-game Club. Choi Taek, 6-dan, lost to Yoo Jin-ho, 9-dan, by only one and a half points in a match that lasted ten hours and 30 minutes. Choi Taek, 6-dan, could not maintain his momentum until the end of the match. Unfortunately, he was defeated by Yoo Jin-ho's last move. Choi Taek, 6-dan... Poor Taek. I bet he feels terrible losing like that. Is Soo-yeon not home yet? She should be home soon. Hey, Master Choi! Chin up. Walk with your chest held high and lift your head. Oh... I bet you had a really tough time today. Well, losses happen-- You worked hard. Mom, I'm going to school! -Hi. -Hey. -Oh, hi. -Hey. What a coincidence. We don't all leave at the same time very often. Now, if only Master Choi comes out... You all going to school? When you live on the same block for about 20 years, you develop a telepathy. Hi, Deok-sun. It's Soo-yeon. Okay. Don't forget Ddochi Western Restaurant tonight. If any of you don't show up, you're all dead. Can you come? Don't you also have a match today? I'll come if it ends early. Don't get lost again. -Okay. -Hey, we're late. -Oh, crap! -Let's go. You should dye your hair a little bit. You're growing a lot of white hairs. Who cares? I am getting old. What about your age? You're only in your 40s. Where are you going? To wash my face. If you're sleepy, you should sleep. Who washes their face to study? That's too much. Geez. You intense bastards. -Where are you going? -Wash my face. It'll look like I suck at studying, because I don't wash my face. Save me, merciful Buddha. Oh, you scared me. Jung-bong, I'm going to the market. Bye. Come with me. It's hard to carry everything. It's so cold. Are you going to the market? Yeah. What are you making for dinner? I'm going to buy a few belt fishes and fry them. Are you taking those bottles to Dooly Supermarket? I could probably buy a package of tofu if I sell them all. Everything okay at work? Of course, it's nothing. Sun-woo still doesn't know? Of course not. I'd be in a big trouble if he did. He's such a gentle kid, but he's really scary when he gets angry. I'm scared of my own child at this age. He just hates seeing his mom suffer. He's a devoted son. He is for sure. You're lucky. You drank a lot. Attention. Bow. Thank you. -Have a good dinner. -Okay. We don't have time. Let's go. Do I have to go? You don't need pork cutlets, because you're a rich boy? I have to use all five today. Dong-ryong, I'm sorry, I have to go somewhere. If the teacher asks, tell him I still don't feel well. I'll be going. Hey, you... What's with him cutting night sessions? If one of us doesn't go, it's fine, I'll just eat two cutlets. But if Taek doesn't come, it'll be a problem. No, Soo-yeon and I can each eat two. No, if I eat three and she eats one, I'll be full. If Soo-yeon eats four-- You idiot. Are you possessed by a ghost who died from wanting to eat pork cutlets? Let's go, we're late. A ghost? Wait for me. Oh, over here. I like the atmosphere in here. Five pork cutlets, please. Okay. What about Sun-woo? -He left to take care of something. -Is he sick? No. I can't believe Sun-woo cut night sessions. Taek's not here yet? I don't think he'll make it. His match yesterday was over ten hours again. Master Choi, welcome. You won, didn't you? It ended early today. Did you order? Yes, we did. Where's Sun-woo? He skipped night session. He said he had something to do. What? Sun-woo did? Looking, looking really close Is this the medium's place? Looking, looking really close Is this the medium's place? Enjoy. He doesn't look like Lee Mi-yeon. Sorry. Can I eat two? Split it with me. Have mine. No, thanks. Put some meat on those bones. Give it to me. There. All right, shall I dig in? First, I have to make room in there. I'm going to the bathroom. You're so disgusting. I didn't say number two. I need the bathroom too. Do I have to go too? It's so damned small! There's nothing to look at! Go home, that's nothing worth looking at. Deok-sun, you're really incredible. Where did you get-- Sit down. Let's eat together. Eat up, Jin-ju. -Okay. -Good. Did you try the citron tea I gave you? Did it taste okay? Yeah, you made it well. It tasted great. Let me know if you run out. -I'll make you some more. -Okay. How's your cold? I took the medicine you gave me and feel a lot better. That's good, then. Jin-ju, eat all you want. Okay. Why aren't they coming back? Wow... Taek's got game. He's really something. Are you done crying? Don't tell the others. It's okay to cry sometimes. Still, it's humiliating. Moo-sung, take good care of her. Okay, go ahead, don't worry. You're going earlier today. Yeah, I forgot to clean the bathrooms yesterday. -I have a lot to do today. -I see. When you clean, make sure you wear gloves. Cleaning supplies are really bad for your skin. Okay. I can't always do that once I start cleaning. Sun-woo doesn't know yet, right? I'm so nervous that he'll find out. Just stay home. Sun-woo is so busy with studying these days. I have to earn a lot of money, so I can buy my Sun-woo sneakers and nice clothes when he goes to the college. Do you think Sun-woo would want that? You don't understand a mother's heart. I'm off, okay? Take good care of her. Thank you. -Make sure you wear rubber gloves. -Okay. CLOSED UKSOO BATHHOUSE Slow down, nobody's gonna steal your food. Look at these kids. They're from comfortable families. They eat respectfully. Only you and I eat like this. It's so humiliating. You're comfortable too. I'm the only poor one. I got these habits from home. I'm afraid someone will steal my food. Will we get something after this? "Something after this"? It's dessert. Do you know parfait? You do, right? -Yeah, I've had it before. -Me too. I haven't. I knew it. I'd be so much more pathetic without you, Deok-- I mean, Soo-yeon. They'll bring us two parfaits soon. Have them both, okay? Yes! The parfait is here. No way. This is freaking amazing! Hey, Soo-yeon. Don't put that in your hair. Put it down. I'm gonna call home. Is something going on at home? I need my brother to record the boxing match. Okay, come back soon. What should I do? Why, you won't be able to eat it? I have to go to the bathroom again. You already went before! You ate so freaking much. Just go. It's fine. Is there an earthquake? Stop shaking your legs and go. Okay, I'll be back soon. -Come back soon. -Okay. I came out to smoke. I see. Go ahead, I'll be right here. Okay. BATHHOUSE I came here to see my mom. Can I go in? You must be Ms. Kim's son. Go in, your mom's inside. Yes, thank you. Please don't tell my mom I was here. WELCOME BONGHWANGDANG Sun-woo. Yes. Your mom went out for a bit. She'll be back soon. It's cold, let's go inside. Mister. I know my mom is working at the bathhouse. I know that too. Where's Jin-ju? She's sleeping inside. Sun-woo, it's just that your mom-- It's okay. I'll pretend I don't know. Oh, okay. Thank you. I'll meet my friends and head home at the usual time. Thank you. Okay. Bo-ra, why do I hate this so much? I hate this. Really, I'm fine. I don't need good shoes or clothes. I don't need private classes. I don't need what the other kids have. I just want her not to work. I really hate seeing my mom suffer. Also, how does Mr. Choi know something that I don't know? Why does he know something... that her own son doesn't know? I told her it's fine, so why is she doing this? I really don't need anything. We can just live like we have been. Her son hates it so much, so why... Seriously. Hey. Enough. Just go massage her shoulders. Go massage her shoulders for her. You hate seeing your mother suffer. It makes you feel better if she doesn't. But for your mom, not being able to buy you Nikes is what she hates most. Why are you only thinking about yourself? Haven't you thought about your mom? Is your peace of mind the only important thing, you immature kid? Loving someone is not just the feeling of wanting to give them things. It's the desperate desire to give them things. Mom, I'm home. I'm hungry. You're home, my Sun-woo! Wash up. I got some goldfish bread for you. -Okay, I'll go wash up. -Okay. Is it good? Yeah, it's really good. I bought it at the three-way intersection. The man, not the woman, sells the good ones. Sun-woo, you love your mom, right? Hey, it's really difficult to love someone. My cute child, No-eul. So warm in here. Loving someone does not mean that you love to feel them near you. But it means that you love to acclimate yourself to them. Why did Jung-hwan run ahead? He had to watch a video or something... He's just like Jung-bong, isn't he? Bye, friend. Okay. Loving someone means no matter how much pain that person causes you, that you find yourself wanting to hate them so much, you can never bring yourself to hate them. Jung-hwan, bring this over to Taek. Loving someone doesn't mean that you don't hate them. It means you can't hate them. TO: MR. KIM JUNG-BONG Jung-bong, did you get a letter? A love letter? Wow, you're so popular lately. Why did your friend take so long to send me a response? I thought I would die waiting. What are you talking about? Maggie sent you a letter? Yeah, here it is. Nonsense. She can't even eat because of the car accident. She can't even move a finger, let alone write a letter. Then what's this? Yeah, I wonder. What is that? Who's it from? "This letter had its beginnings in England, and it makes its rounds every year, giving good luck to those who receive it." It's a lucky letter. You have four days to forward it to seven people. Good luck. Bye. "President Kennedy of the United States received this letter, but ignored it... and was assassinated." SPACE ADVENTURE INVITATION With this card, you can go anywhere you want. {\an8}No way. {\an8}You got so much prettier. {\an8}That's not true. What are you saying? {\an8}-Bye. -I'll call you. {\an8}Okay. {\an8}You can't enter Taek's room until this Saturday. {\an8}Our Taek, do you think you have to eat breakfast or not? {\an8}I have to. {\an8}So frustrating, you idiot. {\an8}You have to put your pressure here. {\an8}-Do you get it? -Like this? {\an8}-Yes. -Okay. {\an8}We really don't have that kind of relationship. {\an8}Do you not like Mr. Choi? {\an8}-Even so, I don't like it. -Sun-woo. {\an8}Moo-sung, aren't you scared? {\an8}I am. {\an8}Oh, my God. {\an8}What do we do? {\an8}Mister, did you get a call from Taek? {\an8}Subtitle translation by Stefanie Elalouf
