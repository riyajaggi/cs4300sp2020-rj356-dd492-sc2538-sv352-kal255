 REPLY 1988 {\an8}JANUARY, 2016 {\an8}Who asked who out on the first date? {\an8}Well, it was... {\an8}Just natural. {\an8}It happened slowly without either of us realizing it. {\an8}Do we really have to tell you that? {\an8}Yes, that's how it is. {\an8}Until you state that you're a couple, {\an8}even if you kiss and hold hands, it's just considered a fling. {\an8}Even with kissing?

 {\an8}Yes, apparently. {\an8}-I heard that from the kids. -What the heck? {\an8}-Don't you say things like that? -I heard some kids say it. My gosh... Our first kiss? Should we say it at the same time on three? -Stop watching so much TV. -That's how people reveal things. Should we answer now? I'll count to three, then we say it together. I'll do it. One, two, three. -1994. -1989! Oh, 1994... it was 1994. Right? It was 1994 in Beijing, right?

 I need to use the restroom for a second. Just a minute. {\an8}Buy some tofu. {\an8}FALL,1994 SSANGMUN, DOBONG, SEOUL {\an8}Tofu! I thought you'd have less work now, but it's just the same. -Get someone you trust to do it. -Hey, I'm the oldest director at our bank. Above me, there's the vice chief, deputy chief, and director. There are so many. If a high school-educated guy like me doesn't work hard... who would keep an old manager around? So, I'm going to take care of my own work. Don't worry. And, about bringing up the voluntary retirement... I only brought it up because I had so much work. Don't worry about that, all right? Oh, wow! It tastes just right. My wife makes the best fermented soybean stew in the world. You're the champion. You should go back to bed. It's still early in the morning. Your flight is in the evening? So, you're going to Japan today and to China the day after? I had no idea that there were so many Go-game matches. -There are a lot at the end of the year. -Oh. Why don't you leave later and rest here for a bit? Oh, we're scheduled for Beijing next week. I guess I'll get to meet our senior's boyfriend. Isn't that Go match in Beijing? I heard you're friends with Choi Taek 9-dan. Why aren't you two dating? What? Our senior told me you two are super close. So, why don't you date? We're just friends, since we were little kids. I've known him for almost 20 years. Wow, then you really must be close. So, why don't you date? What? Hey, there's no such thing as friendship between a man and a woman. Friends? What a joke. Yeah, they're right. My husband is very tired. Salad man is very tired. -Salaryman. -It's the same thing. These days I think that Mr. Dong-geun is so sexy. He's ten years younger than you. How is he your elder? He would jump up in his sleep if he heard that. Oh really. Aren't all good-looking guys older? So, you call your husband that? Well, he is good-looking. Sun-young, there's still one thing that I don't understand. What is it? How could a brutal face like his produce a son like Taek? -What? -Really, it doesn't make sense. How could he have a son like Taek? What? You don't know what you're saying. You've never seen him when he was young, right? He looked just like Taek. If you compare Taek's face now with Taek's dad's face when he was young, you can't tell who is who. They look exactly alike. -Sun-young? -Yes. Your insanity is boundless. Are you still stuck in the honeymoon phase? Do you think we don't know what he looked like young? He was young when he moved here. He looked the same. Is that right? You two are great together. I wondered why you didn't get together a long time ago. Wow, Dong-ryong's mom has some jokes! Mrs. Cho, you felt stuffy, now that you just sit at home, right? I'm sure it was suffocating. You worked all your life. How stifling it must be to watch your grandchildren at home. No... I'm all right. Oh dear, the kids must be awake. I should get going. -Thank you for the sweet potatoes. -Okay. -Bye. -Bye now. Wow. She's quite something. She was so good at working, and she's a good housewife too. That's true. By the way... THIRD TRAINING AIR FORCE SQUADRON KOREAN AIR FORCE ACADEMY Hey, Choi Taek! What is this? You're crazy. What brings you all the way here, punk? I came to see you. Wow, you look so cool. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL Have you made a decision? You can tell me. It's okay. I have some conditions... three of them. What kind? If you're okay with these conditions, we can start dating again. Gosh... You don't have to if you don't want to. Okay, tell me. First... I'm dropping honorifics. If we start dating again, I'm dropping honorifics. I won't call you "ma'am" or use honorifics. Okay, next. Second... What is number one in your life? -Me. -Now, me. I'm not asking you to look after me. I want to be an important part of your life. Not something that is discarded when times are hard. I would like to be one of the most important things in your life. I was just so hurt. All right, and the last one? What's the last condition? As for the last one... Bo-ra, I'm just a regular guy. When I date now, I'm going to think about our next step. I'm thinking ahead to that. If you're scared of that, then don't even start this. Give me time to think about it. Sir! The kimchi stew here is amazing. Eat up. What brings you to my base? You're busy with matches. Jung-hwan. I have something to tell you. Remember a long time ago... when you asked me if I opened your wallet? Honestly, I-- Gosh, you idiot. You're still talking about that? Stop being such a pain for everyone and just go after Deok-sun. You idiot. You're so frustrating. I didn't come to talk about that. Who says I came for that? Oh really? Whatever then. Let's just eat. Just eat. The food here is really good. It really is. It's good. I think I have menopause. I've had no news for several months. Yeah. We are at that age now, aren't we? Oh dear, you know it's no joke. It can be very difficult. What do you mean? It was so annoying having that for over 30 years. Now it's better this way. I'm going to face it, head on. Is there a good one here? I think I like this one. So, you need to be careful from now on. I'll get a fever all of a sudden. I could just leave the house. My whole body will be aching and in pain. Many people get depressed too. I'll make the meals, but I won't do the dishes. I'll do the cleaning, but not the laundry. -Don't worry. I'll do it all. -I'll do it all, Mom. Yeah, so you should call her often. Okay. I guess our mom is already that age. Okay, Jung-bong. I'll call often. But isn't there anything  we could do for her? This is when a daughter would be good. It's not like I can say anything. Can I just overlook it? Who is our mom? She is the great Ra Mi-ran. She is getting through it. Have you eaten, by the way? You're not lonely? Oh, Taek visited me today,  and we ate together. What? All the way in Sacheon? Is something going on? No, what could be going on? He just came to visit a friend. I'm going to go exercise. This late at night? Your nights must feel very long. Ah, what are you saying? Hang up. You know it's Mom's birthday next month. You can come, right? Yes, of course. I checked the calendar, and it's on the weekend, so I have time. Okay, sleep well, my little brother. Good night. Press one to page, two for voice mail, and... Yes, hello.  You weren't sleeping? I finally spoke to the girls.  It's been six years. Congratulations. I'm meeting them tomorrow  at the Tteok-bokki shop. Deok-sun has time too. We're meeting at Brazil Tteok-bokki. They probably got so pretty. What if I can't recognize them? Deok-sun and Ja-hyun haven't changed. I saw them recently. No,  I heard Deok-sun got prettier  since she started working. -Who said that? -Ja-hyun. Those two just console one another by saying things like that. I'm worried that those two might not recognize you, Mi-ok. You should wear a name tag on your chest. When can I see you again? I can see you next week, can't I? I will buy you some tasty rib-eye. Rather than rib-eye, I like pork belly.  Buy me that! Deal! If that's what you want, forget about the pork belly. I'll slice the belly meat off my own body and cook it on a hot fire. Ah, seriously? I think I went too far with my joke. You should go to bed now. BRAZIL TTEOK-BOKKI MENU Hey, this place is completely different. Is this the same Brazil Tteok-bokki that we would go to? Hey, do you think this place has changed as much as you? Mi-ok, did you get plastic surgery in the US? Why are you so pretty now? Unbelievable. I took my braces off. You got pretty, too, you wench. I guess it really is her. She is still so surly. Hey, you couldn't have even called us once? -You awful girl. -You awful girl. I guess we meant nothing to you. Were we the only ones who thought we were close? How could you not call for six years, you awful girl? If I called you, I was afraid I'd miss you guys. If I heard your voices, I thought I'd want to come back to Korea. Even looking at our photos made me tear up. So, how could I call? That's why I couldn't call, you wenches. Here is the sausage and tteok-bokki. I put lots of innards in it for you. Hey... it will bloat. Mi-ok, you're so pretty. I'm going to get braces too. Oh my... -Mi-ran, take these cabbages. -Oh. What are these cabbages for? Dong-ryong went to the market this morning and got some cabbages. Wow, those are really great. These would be great for you to make kimchi with. I'll make it. I'm really good at it. That's amazing. This is a good method too. I should have done this too. Why is Dong-ryong so busy? Dae-ryong opened a second location nearby. Wow, the sales must be good. Dong-ryong is good with people, so his business is doing well. Dong-ryong is running the second location by himself. But he spoke to the reception hall owner and Dong-ryong got that contract too. What good is it to send kids to Seoul University? Wait and see. Dong-ryong will be better off than anyone. Sorry to interrupt. -Hello. -Yes? If it's not too much bother, could you lend me some sesame oil? Of course. Jung-bong, get some sesame oil. Yes, Mom. You didn't go into work today? It's not vacation time yet. I decided to take two weeks off work. Why is that? Is something going on? No, that's not it. I just wanted to rest. I see. That's a good thing. You should take it easy in life. Yes. Here you go, Teacher. Use it liberally. Okay. We heard that Dong-ryong is running a second location. And that he's even catering for wedding reception halls. Oh my, word travels fast. Dong-ryong managed to do something big. You should come by during the day for galbi. I will give you some free coupons. I thought young couples liked buffets these days. I thought they wouldn't like galbi. Would that be okay? My Dong-ryong came up with a brilliant idea. He's always watching those American movies. And he came up with an idea. In America, they wear what's called a morning dress or evening dress. And go around greeting their wedding guests. -We don't really know. -Right. So he has a nice, shiny dress at the restaurant. Once the in-law gifting is over, the bride wears it, then goes and greets the guests during the meal. The wedding cake will be three tiers. And you turn on music too. They do all sorts of things. Young couples like that so much. That sure is a smart idea. Dong-ryong is amazing. Now that things worked out this way, I regret harassing him about his studies. They all figure it out on their own. Not everyone is like that. It's because Dong-ryong is kind and smart. Why do you need sesame oil anyways? Is no one home? No, everyone is home now. I'm not doing anything, so I should do these chores. I'll be going now then. Thank you for this. -Bye now. -Bye. Our teacher is always so bright. We've lived in this neighborhood with him for 20 years. And I've never seen him with a frown. I've never seen him scowl. Look who's talking. What? I've been having a hard time lately. Gosh, you're lying. No, really. I'm home. I'm home. -Why are you home, Bo-ra? -It's the weekend. What? Since when did you come home on the weekends? Be quiet! I'm home. -Hey, I'm getting washed up. -Okay. Pretty girl is home. -No one like that lives here. -Hey! You have one message. It's me.  Come outside. You know where, right? -Where is Deok-sun? -I don't know. -What about Bo-ra? -Don't know. Mom, there's something I've been suspicious about for a while. -What's that? -You know Bo-ra? What about Bo-ra? I think she's seeing someone. Really? Why? What makes you think that? Gosh, that sneaky girl. She wouldn't go to a matchmaker and had no interest in guys. I was actually really worried about her. Who is it? Who do you think it is? He's from the neighborhood. She comes home all the time. And she dresses up. I even smelled perfume on her. -Are you getting a feeling? -Yes. Who could it be? Since Jung-pal is in Sacheon, I'm ruling him out. Why? I like Jung-hwan. I like younger guys too. Then, Jung-bong? What? Jung-bong? -Taek? -Taek! Hey, I like Taek the best. -Me too, me too. -Right, right? But, Taek is scared of Bo-ra. Right? Then Taek is out too. -Then Dong-ryong... no, it can't be him. -Doesn't he have a girlfriend? -Right? A tall and young one. -Yeah. Then there's just one person left. I think this guy is the most likely. It can't be Sun-woo. It can be anyone else, but not Sun-woo. You know why, right? Why don't you hurry up? Hey, what would you have done if I had said no to you kissing me right away? Then you shouldn't have worn that necklace. When did you see that necklace? You had two buttons undone just so I could see. How could I not see? Sun-woo. Sung Sun-woo. Thank you. I love you. Wow... I'm touched. Hey, Taek! I'm dating Bo-ra again. Hey, it's been six years. I'm dating her again after six years! Is this real or is it a dream? You know how hard it's been for me for the past six years, right? Yeah, you know, you punk! I even stole your sleeping pills. It got so bad. But why is your reaction like this, huh? What's wrong? You're not talking about... my Sung Bo-ra, are you? What is that crazy punk saying? Hey, it wasn't a one-sided crush? You guys actually dated? He said they dated. They are dating. Sung Sun-woo, you crazy jerk. Get a hold of yourself! Hey, one-sided love... You had a one-sided crush on Bo-ra this entire time? Hello? Jung-pal? Where are you, Jung-pal? Woo-sun and Ra-bo... Sun-woo and Bo-ra are dating. What? Sun-woo, get over here. Get over here. So, you guys dated each other. Wait, no... You two dated each other. No, you two are currently dating. Hey, wait. Deok-sun, hold on. I'll explain everything slowly now. Just sit down. Sit down. -I suddenly have a headache. -What headache? Wow! How could you fool us for six years like that? Wow... I thought Sun-woo just liked her. Bo-ra likes him too? That's not it. He just liked her. -Is Bo-ra crazy? -Hold up now. Hey... Why am I the only one who doesn't know this? How could you do this to me? Forget it! Just hang up. Sung Sun-woo, I'm the only one who didn't know. Am I not even a friend? Huh? What is he talking about? I don't need this. Forget it. We're not friends. Dong-ryong, I didn't know either. Don't lie to me. Does it make sense that Sun-woo said that in here if you didn't know? I'm not that stupid. How do people lose Go-game to you? Don't laugh. I see you laughing. Me? When? Now, now! Oh, Sung Bo-ra. So you're dating Sun-woo, are you? Hey, wait. Talk to me. Don't bother Bo. Bo? Bo! -What in the world? -Come on. -Ouch. Hey! -Bo? Taek, where are you going? -Hey! You... me... -Hey, "Bo" is a bit much. -Hey! -Hey! That's just not right. You must be insane! {\an8}BEIJING, CHINA CHUNLAN FINALS, ROUND THREE, D-1 Since we have the day off tomorrow, should we go watch? A lot of reporters are here. My boyfriend said to go. I want to go too. I've never seen a Go-game match. I'm going to get Choi Taek 9-dan's autograph. I doubt that you can. He doesn't meet with anyone. But the finals are over tomorrow. Can't I see him if he wins? He goes right to sleep if he wins. He's like a corpse. Right, Deok-sun? Choi Taek 9-dan... Oh, honey. -Oh, Yoo-ram! -Deok-sun. Hello. Where's Taek? He's in his room. The third round is very important, so he's sensitive today and tomorrow. But he's in good condition now, so he's better than before. Has he eaten anything? It's rice porridge. I just sort of made it. You brought this from Korea? China is not that far. Oh my. You really are something. People without friends would be too sad to live. But why don't you give it to him yourself? He'd like it much better than getting it from me. You said tomorrow is important. What if he gets excited from seeing me and messes up? Why don't you just give it to him? You're right. That could happen. He really likes you. He'll become restless if he sees you, and we can't have that. I'll get this to him. What? I was only joking. Oh yeah? I was being serious. There has been a steep increase in voluntary retirements at banks. In order to adjust to the drastic changes  in the financial market scene caused by the open financial markets and the introduction of ATMs, the banks have decided  to trim their workforce. Those who retire voluntarily will receive more than double their pension. Until their retirement, they will receive  70 to 100 percent of a special retirement pension  on top of that, as well. Officials said... Wow... Two times the pension? Then isn't it worth it? If one wants to make a lot of money, that's an opportunity too. What kind of opportunity is that? They just turned 50. Should they just sit at home at such a young age? I'd stick to my work, even if they offered me a lot of money. Honey, Dong-il is hanging in there, right? Even though he always talks about quitting. Who knows what he's thinking? Everything might be crumbled inside, and he might be dead inside. Voluntary retirement can be by choice. But many banks are requiring  their employees to take this retirement. This includes Hanil Bank, Joheung, Commercial, and Seoul Trust banks. Those who have not moved up the ranks or those too high up in the ranks have been included in this retirement. Gosh, that man. What if he just leaves his bank? {\an8}CHUNLAN, FINAL ROUND THREE -Sir. -Yes, Deok-sun. Did you come to see Taek? Why is it so quiet? Hasn't it started? Of course it started. They're all in the monitor room. The monitor room? Now, you can watch directly on the monitors. You don't have to wait in the hall. Ah... MONITORING ROOM I think I'll go wait in my room. I'm too nervous to watch. Please call me when the match is over. I'm in room 503. -Thank you. -Okay, go to your room. I'll call you as soon as it's over. The game has looked good for Taek from the get-go. I think it'll end early. Seeing as how he's attacking, I think he's already figured it out. Still, you don't know until the very end with Go-game. Oh my, Deok-sun! You know all about Go-game now. -Deok-sun, I'm meeting my boyfriend. -Okay. Hello, is it over? Did Taek come out? Did he win? It's me, Taek. Ah... Oh, Taek. You worked hard. Are you all right? Yeah, I am. I'm done and I'm in my room now. -Does your head hurt? -Yeah, a little bit. I took some medicine. You should have eaten first. Go to bed. Why did you bother calling first? I'm hungry though. I'm hungry. Deok-sun, let's go eat together. I'll see you in the lobby. Okay. Let's go. Oh, Taek. You came out. Deok-sun. We're going for dinner now too. Come with us. Let's go. Beef and lamb? Okay. MENU Taek, have some crab porridge. Cheers to Master Choi's consecutive wins. -Cheers. -Cheers! This place is famous in Beijing. Enjoy your food here. -Thank you. -Yeah. Yum. This place is good. Right? Is it good? Yeah, is yours good? You're very good at drinking. I'm not that good at drinking. Why did you two drink so much? -Hey! -She is passed out. -Pull yourself together. -Yes. -Take her up. -Ma'am. Come on. Let's go. Get up now. Go sleep in your room. -Deok-sun, give me your room key. -Okay. Here. -Take care getting back. -Get it together, would you? Get back to your room then. ROOM 503 Excuse me. Is anyone here? You didn't go to your room? The door is locked. I think she is sleeping. You should get going. Go in and get some sleep. I'll get a key when an employee comes back. Sleep in my room. You can sleep in my room. Wow. You can sleep in the bedroom. I can just sleep here. It's okay. I'll sleep on the sofa. You should sleep in the room. You didn't even sleep properly. How can I sleep properly when you're on the sofa? The bed and sofa are the same to me once I take my pills anyways. You take that much nowadays? I've built up a tolerance. If you take too many, you can end up sleepwalking at night. What would you do if that happens? Hey, it's not that bad yet. You never know. Make sure you lock your doors tonight. I don't know what I'll do once I take my pills. Why? Will you kiss me again? So... that wasn't a dream? Why? Why did you lie? I was scared. We're friends. What if it got awkward? If things got awkward with you... I just couldn't imagine it. What about now? It would be awkward now too. But... Hey... how could you say 1989? But it was 1989. I was a senior then. -I was in high school. -Right, you were a senior. I can't keep track of those things because I didn't go to school. So what if you were a senior? You're a public figure. I'm sure people would love it if they knew you had a first kiss in high school. People think you're Buddha. Should we ask them to delete this? How can you do that? That makes you look worse. Let's ask them to re-shoot that part, okay? I'll talk to them. -Okay, okay. -Let's go. MEDICINE Hey, stop it with the sleeping pills. Okay. I'll take less from now on. Deok-sun, I'm going to sleep now. All right. You should get going. Bye. Hi. Hello... Hi. Why are you here? When did you leave last night? I left right after you said you needed to sleep. Why? Why? Did you have a dream? Yeah. That's a relief. What is it? Was I in your dream? What kind of dream was it? No, it was just nonsense. You don't need to worry. I knew it. Oh, what about Dong-ryong? Him? I envy him the most. He's probably at the hospital playing and relaxing. Hey, wake up, would you? You're so out of it. I'm going now. What are you doing? MEDICINE We could have beef. I like places like this. And pork belly is the best, frozen pork belly, that is. How could it be that you and I have the same taste in food too? Then can I order the food? Over here. You want it as thin as possible? Yes, that's what makes frozen pork belly taste the best. It will curl up though. I can unroll it then. That's another good part of frozen pork belly. Okay. This is really thin. -It's like-- -It's like sliced pork belly, right? It's my favorite style. I think you have a very specific philosophy when it comes to food. Why don't you stop studying law and start looking into this? Look into this? Do you think I'd have a chance? Still, law is cooler. How is that true? It's not as good. And what's wrong with food? Food is the most important thing in life. And this is something Deok-sun told me. She said that the ramen you make is the best in the world. Do what you like to do. Whatever it is that you think about all night. I studied fashion even though I didn't want to because of my dad. I'd like it if you did something that you want to do. Just a sec. Blood sausage, tteok-bokki, and tempura? They still sell bread fries? All right, Dad. I'll buy it later. How much is this? Gosh, now. Just make a decision, and I'll tell you the price. -I need the price. -Make your decision first. -I think ten will be enough, right? -Yes. ten will do. My store has everything, so... Don't do that. My baby can't do this. Go over there. What's with you? You brought the food? Yeah, that tent is still around. Were you on a date? No. Come on now. You're in a dress and all. Dad, can I date now? Yes, you're not a student. I need to get you married. I'm going to get you married off and then I'll stop working too. It's about time. I'll spend my life going on cruises with your mom. What? My dad loves money. Could you do that? You opened a third location last month. Did your mom say that? That location is the best. You haven't been there, right? The spot is perfect. That one is going to do so well. You said you're giving it all up and going on cruises. We have a customer. -Hello there. You interested in that? -Yes. Don't leave. -Hang out with your dad. -Okay, don't worry. What do you need to see? -Is this silk? -Yes. Oh my! You scared me. Why are you sitting here like this? Dong-il. Why are you just sitting here? Why? Is something wrong? Il-hwa. Today... I was forced to voluntarily retire. I am sorry. No. Why should you be sorry? No, honey. There is nothing you should be sorry about. What are you doing just sitting there? Don't turn on the light. I can't sleep. Honey, are you all right? I'm not okay. I'm not okay. Oh dear. What? Really? Dad? Your dad... no longer needs to work. He's done with the bank. He will retire next week, and it will really be over. Voluntary retirement? Did you apply for it? Why? If you apply for it now, you get two and half times your pension. So, I did it. Do you know how much we're getting? We're getting more than 200 million won. -That much? -Really? When else would we get that kind of money? He would be retiring in three or four years anyways. I heard that many people were retiring at the banks. I didn't think you would, Dad. I just decided to jump on the chance. I'm getting a free 100 million won. Still, you worked there a long time, so you must feel sad. I'll come home often. Why would I be sad? Do you know what your dad's wish is? It's to sleep really late until the sun comes up for once. Dad, you should go on trips with Mom and exercise too. Last year was hard for Mom too. You should hold hands and eat lots of yummy food, okay? I will go around with him, but I don't know about holding hands. It's enough if you don't fight. Il-hwa! Oh? What brings you by? We're home right now. Il-hwa, I just need three minutes. Hwangdang, Bonghwangdang! It's a strange sight to see you here during the day. Yes, I'm still finding it strange too. You've been married for five years and you still can't get a decent meal? What's with the black bean noodles? Jung-hwan's family was ordering, so I got one too. -Let's eat together. -Sure, it looks new. Oh? Are you delivering black bean noodles again? My wife kicked me out. She says she doesn't even want to see my face. She told me to leave. Put that here. It's nice to eat together. Yeah, sit down. You know... when it's time for a woman's menopause, they hate the entire world, and everyone's their enemy. And the person they hate the most is their husband. I really suffered last year because of my wife. I didn't know my wife had that side to her, really. If it weren't for true love, she probably would have hit me. It was really bad. Why did that make me mad? He just put ice cream on the table. You can get mad. I get annoyed a lot at Taek's dad too. A fire rose up from inside of me. And I had tears in my eyes. Goodness. This is not normal. He was passing by and got the brunt end of it. Why are you getting upset again? It's okay. Mi-ran, you're just 52 years old. You don't even have a gray hair. You're still young. You're still fresh! I don't have gray hair, yet I'm like this. Gosh. You got through it well. You did. You're amazing, Il-hwa. I don't know about amazing. I still put a bucket of water at my bedside before I go to sleep. I do wake up two times and wail loudly. Well, you know... Still, you have daughters so you get through it. Our poor Mi-ran doesn't have any daughters. Poor dear... You need daughters at times like these. I should have one now. Ah, I can't. Darn it. Nothing is working out for me at all. I see that you're making jokes now. You must be okay now. I go back and forth. I did envy you a bit last year. Did you? I guess my daughters are good at taking care of the little things. I wouldn't say it's that. It's because they are your daughters, so they know a mom's heart. Sons will never know a mother's heart. And Deok-sun is especially good. Lately, I just want to make her my daughter-in-law. {\an8}LAST YEAR, 1993 Mom, let's head out. Get up, okay? Get dressed. -Let's go. -Where? -Let's go. -I'm tired. No, let's go. Hurry up. There's a place next to Ssangmun Station that makes really good fried pancakes. -It's supposed to be really good. -Okay. -Mom, aren't you cold? -I'm okay. There. Let's go. Let's go. What the heck... I ought to be re-born. I need to be born as a mother. I'm so envious. It's pretty. Can you erase it? -How can I go out like this? -Why not? Let's put it on this side too. It's expensive medicine.  Make sure to take it. Pillar of the house, Your second daughter. Our nation's Choi Taek 9-dan won the Chunlan Go-game match in China. In the final round, Choi Taek... Taek won again? He must be crazy. He's not human. Hello? Oh, Taek! Congratulations. You're in Korea? When did you get back? Oh, hold on. Deok-sun. Yeah? Okay. I have to see Taek for a bit. You should finish eating. Taek. Isn't something strange? Is Deok-sun maybe... Just eat. Are you still that nosy? When did you get back? Just now. Aren't you tired? I'm okay. Aren't you cold? I'm all right. Ah, this is warm. Tomorrow is Dad's retirement party. I'm already about to get teary-eyed. Can't I go too? Don't even think about it. If you come, it will get noisy. And only family is supposed to come. All right. But, can't I just stop by for a bit? No, if you come, you'll be the main attraction. Tomorrow, my dad has to be the star. Okay. Then I'll just stay in the back and-- Ah! Hey! You better listen, okay? Yes. All right. This was the suit Bo-ra bought you with her first check from the legal training center. Gosh, what were you saving it for? You never wore it. I didn't think it would be for this. That's why they say things turn to crap if you save them. I think they're correct. Why are you going to cry now? I got lots of money and left my job. It's fine, so stop crying. What do you mean it's fine? You always say that. It's okay. Gosh, you look so good. Let me see. Oh my. Oh my. You guys sure know how to surprise a person. Yeah, thank you so much, Jin-ju. You worked so hard all this time. You worked hard. You didn't have to do this. I was going to give you this first. I told Jung-bong to keep watch at the front gate. For crying out loud. It's not like I'm the president of Korea. Why make such a fuss? It's going to be done in an hour, and I'll be back. Then, be back quickly. I'll have a warm drink ready for you here. Manager Sung, you worked very hard all those years. Gosh, man. We're all going to switch banks now. He is no longer at Hanil Bank, so why should we go there? Right? I was going to switch my account too. That darn, crappy Hanil Bank. To hell with Hanil Bank. Deok-sun will be waiting. You should get going. You've never ever been late, so you can't be late for your retirement. So I'm going to be unemployed now. Please take good care of this unemployed man here. Stop joking around. Dad, we're going to be late. Hurry up! Okay, I'm coming. I'll be going. Thank you. See you. -Bye now. -Thank you. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL Hello? Yeah, Bo-ra. Yeah, are you at the hospital? Yeah, is something wrong? Isn't your dad's retirement today? Did it go well? It did end okay.  I just don't feel good. You should comfort your dad. He's probably more depressed than anyone. It's not like I expected anything great. But it was just so simple and short. About 30 people retired together. He didn't even get a plaque. They just gave him some flowers. He worked there for 30 years and all they gave him were some flowers? I was about to protest like my old self. Are you home? Let's meet later. I'll go even if it's late. Yeah, I'm home. I'm going to stay home for a bit. Dad went for soju with my mom. Those two have become closer lately. That's good. What about Deok-sun? Not sure. She was going on about it for a while, but I don't see her. Oh, you startled me! I just can't stand by like this. No-eul's coming too. Just do as I say. Sun-woo, I'll call you back later. Bo-ra, are you really a Seoul University graduate? Is this the best you can do? Hey, do you think I majored in Korean? Give it to me. I'll do it. -Do it fast. I have to give it to them. -All right. -You're leaving now? -Yeah, but don't wait for me. I'll probably arrive late. -Okay, you have to drive carefully. -Okay. How is Mom doing? - I'm not sure. -What? She seems okay at times and then not okay too. This is why a household needs a daughter. Wait.  The second daughter will be there soon. Are you home, son? Yes. Are you okay, Mom? Yes, I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm going to sleep. See you later, son. Look who it is. It's Lieutenant Kim. Sir. What kind of salute is that? If you were under my command, you'd be dead. Am I crazy? Why would I be under your command? When did you get back? Late last night. Let's have a drink later. Taek is finishing up early. Today is my mom's birthday. We're going out. Oh, that's why you're up here. Have you made a reservation? I was going to make one with my brother. Do you know a good place? I don't know. I'll try to think of one. Is it going well with Bo-ra? You say you're dating and you don't even know a nice restaurant? You're younger. Why don't you know a restaurant? I've been living in Sacheon. Lately, I've been... a housewife. Yes? Dong-ryong? -What's up? -Hey, where are you right now? What are you saying? One of the wedding reception guests canceled on me. We prepared galbi for 100 people. The bride ran off this morning  with her first love. What? I already got the payment,  so the money is fine. The galbi would go to waste. Let's have a neighborhood party. Invite everyone you see from now on. Hey, do you have cake there too? Are you kidding me?  I have a three-tiered one. It's your mom's birthday, isn't it? You got lucky today, punk. I'll surprise you and turn this  wedding cake into a birthday cake. Wait, don't change it. What time should I be there? It's the last time slot,  so about 7:00 p.m. Just leave now if you want. All the customers from before have left. Anyways, invite all the neighbors. I'm treating today. Thanks, Dong-ryong. Jung-bong, I have a good idea. What? GAMPOMYEONOK Hey, how many people are coming? I think it will be about 20 people. Deok-sun will be here for sure, and Jung-pal too. It's been a long time since I've seen all the neighbors. Oh yeah, Dong-ryong. Mom is coming too. Really? She's done now? She's coming straight here. -This is all because of you, Dae-ryong. -What did I do, kid? Hello there! Is this Ryu Dong-ryong's restaurant? We came for the free galbi. -Are you here? -Hi, Dae-ryong. Hi. You're the first family here. Is this Dong-ryong's store? -We'll take one of these here. -Yes. -Where is it? -Over there. -We came for the galbi. -Hello. Dong-ryong! -Welcome! -Hello. -Hi, Dong-ryong. -Hello. Mister, two galbis please. Wow, Sung Deok-sun. You got pretty. Hey, your parents are here. Come on in. Okay. -You came alone. -I came with my manager. Is that the only person you're friends with? I told you to bring everyone. -Hello! -Hello! I did bring people. Mi-ok, Ja-hyun, say hello. This is my friend Dong-ryong. Hello. Oh, it's you right? Ssangmun High's Park Nam-jung? Ssangmun Girls' High's Joey Wong? -Long time. -What is this? Did I hook you guys up? Shut up. I likely have a girlfriend. I think the broth is ready now. I have to go inside. I'm fine. Worry about your own love life. -Let's go. -I feel upset. Looks delicious! Who's missing? That punk. He thinks he's a star and now he's always late. -Hello. -Hello! -Hello. -We heard there was free galbi. Why are you just getting here? The galbi stew is cold now. I drove here. Then I guess I understand. Have some stew. Hey. -Mom. -Give us some food too. Mom, we've prepared some galbi for you. If there isn't any, we'll go. You did a good thing, so come in and eat. All right. The school dean is here. -Hi. -Hello. Who isn't here? Hands up. Jung-pal and his mom. His dad is not here either. That's true. He's the one who told me to prepare everything. Hello... Is this Dong-ryong's place where they make the best galbi? And you are that Mrs. Cheetah of Sssangmun that I've heard all about. Please come in. -Come on in. -Hello. -Hi. -Hello. -What are you doing over there? -Hey, get ready. I was feeling down because it was my birthday. I feel a bit better because we're all having dinner together. Why would you feel down on your birthday? You should be happy today. Mom, I'd like to wish you a happy 52nd birthday. We can go home later and have another party with our family. Son, I don't want to make a big deal out of my 52nd birthday. Oh! Oh no! What should I do? I'm so sorry. What can I do? What a mess. I'm so sorry. It's okay. I'm fine. You better change your clothes. It will start to smell. I don't have clothes here. Well, we do have some clothes here. Do you want to get changed into them? My gosh... I'm sorry... Hurry. Be careful now. Over this way. -Come over here. -Okay. Finished. What about the music? No need to worry. -What about the cake? -It's ready. Jung-pal, someone is here. You're the flower boy. Me? But my girlfriend is here. Then should I do it? Actually, it's always been my dream to be a flower boy. -You didn't know, did you? -No. Here you go. Okay. Who gives her the bouquet? Who's doing nothing? -Who? -You. You can give it to her. When I turn on the music, you give it to your mom. What? I'm not good at this stuff. You crazy punk, this was all your idea. Ma'am, can you help Jung-hwan's mom? Why? Is something wrong with her clothes? Is she not coming? Really? I'm eating galbi wearing this now? Wow, it fits you perfectly. My body is glamorous. Will I be able to digest in this thing? Should I just take it off and eat? I am feeling warm. Gosh, you look pretty. When else would you get to wear something like this? -How can I go out? -Ma'am. The prime beef is ready. Okay, I got it. -Hurry up and come out. -Okay. So pretty. Goodness, what is this? Seriously... -Mom. -Wow! Wow. What is this now? You're so pretty. Why are you all making a fuss? So pretty. What's going on here? I should be careful in this dress. -You look good. -I'm so embarrassed. Wow. Wow! You look great! Oh my. She's crying. Why are you crying? Bride and groom, please enter. -Kiss! -Kiss! -Kiss! -Kiss! -Dong-ryong! -Dong-ryong! -Dong-ryong! -Dong-ryong! -Dong-ryong! -Dong-ryong! Blow out the candle. -One, two, three! -One, two, three! Whose idea was it? Your "daughter's." -What? -Jung-hwan? How did you know that picture was a fake? I thought we would never get caught. It was obvious you had combined two photos. Thank you, Jung-hwan. My menopause is gone. Thank you. I didn't do it for this. It's nothing to cry over. Why are you doing this? Be quiet, you! Why are you crying over that? It's a good thing. How embarrassing. -Dad. -Yeah? We have something for you too. Huh? A present. What's with all of you? Have you all suddenly grown up or what? What is this? We decided to have our own retirement party with our family. Open it, Dad. Oh... -What's this? -Oh! Isn't this a Thank You plaque? Wow, I'll read it for everyone. -Don't read it. -You can't. Why? It's a present from children to their father. We should read it while we're all together. -No. -Please don't read it. Yes, don't read it. If you read that now, everyone will cry. Sir, you should still just read it. You can take insults later. Is that right? I became a new groom in my 50s. I'll just take some insults today. Why not? Read it. "Thank you plaque." "You worked at Hanil Bank for 26 years. Manager Sung Dong-il..." Gosh, I don't think I can read this. "Thank you plaque." "You worked at Hanil Bank for 26 years. Manager Sung Dong-il, we would like to thank you. We may no longer be able to call you Manager Sung Dong-il. What has not changed is that... Sung Dong-il is Lee Il-hwa's husband. And Sung Bo-ra, Sung Deok-sun, and Sung No-eul... He is the proud father of three siblings. These are the things our father likes to say the most: Crap and heck. The words my father hates the most are... Forever Assistant Manager and loan guarantee. The thing my father did best... was buying useless items. And giving us kisses. His favorite food is seasoned cockle shells and soju. And the thing my father loved the most... It was our family. As our father's daughters and son... because we could not give him a warm word... and we couldn't have a drink with him that he liked so much... or hold him in our arms first... Or tell him we love him first... And we could not consider the weight of the title "dad"... We are sorry and apologize. Even then, he was like a tree that never stopped giving. A dad that Bo-ra respected. A dad that was like a friend to Deok-sun. And to No-eul... a dad that provided stability. With that thankful heart... we give you this plaque. November 5, 1994. From, Your children." For goodness' sake. Why did you bother reading that? Our Deok-sun is so pretty. Hey, you guys liven up the mood, would you? What the heck... -My goodness. -Do something. -You sure had good kids. -Hey, turn it on. Turn what on? -Ra Mi-ran! -Ra Mi-ran! -Ra Mi-ran! -Ra Mi-ran! Those thirsty lips Even the stars fall asleep Let's stay this way forever I only love you Those blissful words Il-hwa, have you heard of Hwa-moo-sib-il-hong? Yes, I have. "A chrysanthemum has its season, and the beauty of a flower will not last ten days." This time, I want to get to my senses and do something. But that seems to be a luxury too. Like this... My life has almost passed now. Time doesn't pass by just for us. It passes by for everyone. Who can you complain to? You just accept it and go along with it. I realized something really big today. What's that? I thought it was all over once the petals fall off. But... after the petals fall, there is another fruit that blooms. I forgot about that. I only got sad because my flower petals weren't going to bloom again. I couldn't see that. I know I got let go from work. But the way I raised my children... I did such a good job, right? Yes, but... who knows? Later on, they might cause us grief. Maybe, I spoke too soon, didn't I? But you never know. This heart we have for our children, someday they will... answer us. "Thank you." Let's go. So, you're going to work at the counter at the supermarket? So, you're going to be a cashier? Yes. You're really something, you know? I got trained yesterday and today. I'm starting tomorrow. Since you've always worked, you'll get sick if you stay home. Dong-ryong's mom, did you go somewhere? I didn't see you around for a while. I... left home. -What? -Why? Why? Where? It was two or three weeks ago. I left and came back yesterday to eat galbi. But why did you leave home so suddenly? For me... In my life... Just being called Dong-ryong's mom or Dae-ryong's mom made me unhappy. My name is Cho Soo-hyang. I was watching my grandchildren. My heart suddenly felt so suffocated. I wondered what I was even doing there. I thought I'd go insane like that. When my grandchildren were asleep, I just went to my sister's in Daejeon. That's why Mr. Ryu was home. He was taking care of the house. He's thoughtful. He didn't even call because he thought I'd worry. Yes, everyone is okay. Don't wake her. No. Brother-in-law, do you want  to pick up my sister now? No, I'm going to let Soo-hyang rest. When your sister is better, give me a call. Then I'll go pick her up. How are the kids? What about your food and school? I'll take care of it. Just take care of your sister. Bye now. Peekaboo! Wow, he is a real man. He really is. Oh my, but he didn't even let us know at all. We would have helped him out if we had known, right? Mom, I'm home! Okay, my oldest is here. Bo-ra, are you here? Bo-ra, everyone's here. -Hello. -Hi. Please have some persimmons. My mom likes these. -Have fun then. -Okay. Bo-ra's face looks better and better. Isn't it time for her to get married? Isn't she dating? I think she is dating. -Mom! -Yeah! He was on his way home, so I told him to buy some red bean bread. You should just sell those things. How much do you eat per year? I know. Are you here? Hello. I bought a lot of them. -Bon appétit. -Okay. -I'll be going now. -Okay. Mom, see you. -Bye. -Bye. He should stay a bit. What is this now? We see each other all the time. The two of them have something going on. {\an8}Stop saying total nonsense. {\an8}Do you want to see your mom faint? Shut your mouth now. {\an8}Sun-woo must have so much to stress about. {\an8}He'll do fine. {\an8}Are you confident about it? {\an8}Mom, can you let it go just this once? {\an8}I'm confident I won't change. {\an8}Aren't you? {\an8}That can't ever happen. {\an8}Hey. {\an8}Did you do that on purpose to anger me? {\an8}You just never know with people. {\an8}The bride will now enter. {\an8}Bride, enter. {\an8}Subtitle translation by: Alison Woods
