 - I'm really going to say it. - Yeah. Go ahead. I like you, Bo ra. I said... I like you. I like you too. You know that I'm not joking. I'm being serious. I have a boyfriend. I know. And I've never thought of you as a man. Not even once. Yes, I know. Why would you inconvenience me by telling me something like this? - Are you concerned because of me? - No. How you feel about me is your own prerogative. But I've made my own feelings clear to you.

 Yes. Don't worry about them. Of course I'm not going to! Why would I? This little kid... messing with me! Whatever. Stop it. I'm tired. Bye. I don't want to be tangled up with you because of something like this. Keep what happened tonight between just the two of us... got that? Let's take this to our graves. Got that? But... thanks. [Episode 7: To that person] [Seven days until Christmas Eve] Okay. We'll now be starting our first ever secret Santa! Wow! What are we doing? Um... secret Santa. I'm going to draw names for secret Santa. - What the hell? - Why? - Just pretend you didn't hear. - Why are we doing this? Oh, Bo ra. What's up? Why did you call me over? So you're here. Well... Assholes. All right. Since we're all gathered here... We'll officially begin the secret Santa... What the hell did you say? Secret freaking Santa? Bo ra. Couldn't you speak just a bit more quietly? My heart is... So you called me here for this? I'm damn busy, you know! jung bong. I have to go to the baduk club... Okay, taek. This will be over soon. Just wait a bit longer. How come? I think it'll be fun. - jung bong! Let's do it! - Thanks, no eul. Okay... since everyone is busy, I'll do this quickly! I'd like everyone to take one each. Yes, one each. You will be the secret Santa for whoever's name is written on the paper. You have exactly one week. So, um... By Christmas Eve, you have be secretly nice to the person whose name you have. Of course, a present is essential. Hey. Why does he want to do this all of the sudden? He's collecting records. As for the present, you have to figure out what your person would really want and then give it to them on the last day. For your reference, as for me... If you were to have me... I really want the fourth official mbc campus music festival record. But I just have no means whatsoever to procure it for myself, so, what to do... He's collecting the official mbc campus music festival records and the fourth one is the only one he's missing. You guys are rich though! My mom said that she'll kill him if he buys one more. He's not getting any allowance until his test results come back. He's totally broke. All right, everyone. Let's focus! You all know the rules, right? In other words, it's like having a "secret friend" so you can't tell anyone who your person is! [Kim jung bong] jung bong! I'll buy you that record. I have you. What? What the hell? I have him, too. So do I. [Kim jung bong] What the hell is this? Oh, well... this is... Give it back. Okay. Okay. That was just a test round. The practice round is over. I'm going to chop your hands off if you keep messing around! Got it? I'm leaving. What is up with this childishness? Even so, he took the time to prepare this. Just pick a name and then go. Damn it. Assholes. I'll head out then. Sorry. Yeah, let's let him go. He's been here for a while already. Okay. Bye, taek. Bye, master choi. - Bye. - Bye, taek! What if people pick each other? Then you can just be good to each other. It's like fate. Get married! Get married! - Get married! - Get married! What if you pick yourself? That's fate too, so... - Get married! - Get married! [Dong ryong] No way would that happen, though. There are so many people here. We're done, right? I'm leaving, too. Bo ra! You have until Christmas Eve! You have a week! I told you, I'm not doing it! Hey! Hey... what's with you? Hey! What's with you? What are you doing? [Bo ra] You're such an asshole! [Sun woo] What are you doing? They're doing a neighborhood meeting at my place. Since they're singing, i think they're just about done. Let's go to taek's. We can have some ramyun. I have something to talk to you about. With me? What's the point of having a neighborhood meeting? They talk to each other every day. I know, right? They're so earnest about it. I guess they're deciding something big. Nothing? If there's no other feedback, then... We'll do notebooks. That's a good idea! Notebooks... yeah! So let's end the meeting here! Okay, then. Then, this year, the present for our kids this year will be... Notebooks, notebooks, yeah! Excuse me. How about a notepad instead of a notebook? A notepad... ow! I'm sorry. He's not well, you see. Such nonsense... Whether it's a notebook or a notepad, I'll buy it for our kids! All right... then, with this, our monthly neighborhood meeting is over. - Nobody has anything else, correct? - No! Next week, we'll have the meeting at his place. Okay. All right, that's it! Finally! Geez... why do we need to have a three hour long meeting? Excuse me. I have something to say. Geez, Ms. sun young. Let's stop and go home, already! Don't you see Mr. choi sleeping over there? Um... last year which one of you told Jin joo that Santa doesn't exist? Who was it? Who went and blabbed to this innocent child that there's no Santa, huh? Who do you think? It was probably that family's eldest daughter. [One year ago] Give me one. Ah. Just one. No! Santa gave these to me! Jin joo. Your mom bought those. There's no such thing as Santa. I knew it. She's always had such a temper. Well... even so, kids tend to forget things quickly. We'll buy Jin joo's Christmas present this year. Um... wake the kid up, please. Hit her or something. Jin joo... Um... Jin joo! What do you want from Santa this year? I'll relay what you want to Mr. Santa. What do you want? There's no such thing as Santa. Want to watch a video after we eat? Die hard's out now. I'm going to the study room. I have to finish all my physics homework by today. But you're the one who decided that. Do it tomorrow. I'm checking over all my homework, and playing with Jin joo in the evening... Eat up. At times like this, you're such a model student. Such a mysterious bastard. What? Why are you starting with me again? You like Bo ra, right? I happened to hear. Oh... really? When? On the day it snowed. Behind my front door. It's a secret. Of course, bastard. I won't tell anyone. I thought you liked duk seon for sure. Why her, for sure? Duk seon is prettier. What? She's the prettiest among the uglies. What are you saying? - Are you saying she's pretty or ugly? - Of course I'm saying she's ugly! The meeting should be over by now, right? Kids will believe anything as long as there's a present next to them in the morning. So buy Jin joo a present and put it next to her, okay, Mr. sung? Jin joo! What do you want for Christmas? We'll buy it for you. Go ahead and tell me. I'll buy it. What do you want? A snowman! That's a piece of cake! Oh, my Jin joo wants a snowman? What do we do? That's something that's only possible with Mr. Santa around. Who else could buy you a snowman? That's right! There isn't a place that sells snowmen and so only Mr. Santa could bring that for you! Then, Jin joo... I'll put a special request in to Mr. Santa for that gift, for you! Okay? But, um... that day... Jin joo! jung bong has steamed red bean buns. Go ask him for one. Steamed red bean buns? But, um... what if it doesn't snow on that day? How do we make a snowman, then? Oh no... you're right. I didn't think that far ahead. It will snow. It says it'll snow in the Seoul area on the 23rd and the 24th! We're saved, then! There's nothing to worry about, then! If it snows, making a snowman is no big deal. Yeah, that's great! Let's keep things short from now on! Geez, by the time our next meeting is over, I'll be dead. Hey, Mr. choi! Wake up! Wow... that guy... I've never seen someone fall asleep so easily at someone else's house. What a great fortune he has. It's because he wakes up so early all the time since he wants to feed taek. At any rate, let's meet up on the night of Christmas Eve. Okay? Everyone should come out. The more the merrier! That's right. Well, since it's vacation, all I have is time! All right, I'll be going, then! - Okay! - Goodbye! - Does your wrist hurt again? - Yeah. I guess winter is coming. It always hurts around that time. Madam. Have something to eat here before you go. Want to make some kimchi noodles? Your wrist hurts, so we should do that... How about some Chinese-Korean food? I want jjamppong. I want jjajjangmyun... With red pepper flakes! Mr. choi, where are you off to? Oh... I have to make dinner. Oh geez... you can just eat here! That's right! Have some jjajjangmyun. Taek isn't here since he went to the baduk club. Even so... what if he doesn't eat dinner before he comes home? We can make him dinner! It's okay for him to miss just one meal! If I were to be reincarnated, I'd want to be reborn as Mr. choi's son. You're seriously the best when it comes to taking care of your kid! The moms here should take a few pointers from you. No, that's not true. I don't do much. If you "don't do much," she does literally nothing! Compared to you, she's a good-for-nothing! What did you just say? Hurry up and beg for her forgiveness! I'm just saying! Did I say that you were really like that? You know how I feel. Hurry up and apologize! Why do I need to apologize over something like this? Forget about that. Instead of an apology... I'll give you a "b" -pology. Goddammit... stop it with your stupid dad jokes! What? A "b"-pology is worth more than an "a"-pology! "B" comes after "a," so it's worth more! Shut your damn mouth! Get the hell over here! I'm going to beat you to death! Okay, "c"-pology, then! "D"-pology? "D" -pology my ass! Yeah, duk seon... it's mom. We're going to order some jjajjangmyun. You guys order something, too! The house up front will pay you. Will do. Enjoy your meal! Thank you. Dong ryong. How did you know to come? I heard the sound of a motorcycle. What about the others? They're studying. Those bastards. Who did you get for secret Santa? I don't know. I don't care. Eat up, jung bong. How did... what fate! Huh? Wait. Okay. jung bong... are you, by chance... You have to follow the rules. You two picked each other, didn't you? You two suit each other. Get married, you two. - Get married. - Get married. No eul. I don't have much money as of late. If not for that, I would have bought you an entire bunch of bananas! Oh, no need for that! Instead... can I... Go ahead. If it's something I can do for you, anything is game. You said you're getting me that record I want, so... There's nothing i wouldn't want to do for you. If there's anything in this room that you want I'll give you anything. Do you, by any chance, have "Hwang sa?" "Hwang sa?" You mean, "an unwelcome visitor on a spring day?" In my room? No! You know, "a charming adolescence." Oh, that novel. You have it, right? I don't have it myself, but someone I know does. If you want it, i can get it for you. Kim jung bong... [jung hwan] I feel so bad because i can't make you anything delicious... No, it's fine! It's delicious! How is Lee mi Yeon so pretty even when she lives in the boonies? [A charming adolescence] Taek isn't back yet? Hey, knock before barging in! Geez! Knock, my ass. What were you doing? I didn't do anything. What are you talking about? You didn't do what? What do you want? Mind your own. Fine! Is it raining outside? Why is it raining so much? Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wait! Hey! Wait! What are you doing? Where do you think you're touching? Hey! Give it! Okay, okay! I'm giving it to you! Hey! What the hell is this? Little kids don't need to know. Geez... all you know is dirty stuff. Hey. All the other kids read this too. You think I'm the only one? All the kids in my class read it too. Geez! What? Huh? Huh? Guys look at this kind of stuff with their friends all the time! Why are you making such a big deal out of it? How could you read a book like this with your friends? Disgusting. Disgusting? Hey. Do you think I'd read it with my mom, then? At any rate, you're such an animal. Why, you little... I'm going to go meet taek on his way home. Watch the house for me, okay? Yes, sir. Don't worry. We'll watch over your house well. Right? - Are you going to meet taek? - Yes! He didn't take an umbrella with him. What a guy! He always goes to see him with an umbrella on rainy days even though he doesn't even know what time he'll be done! I bet he'll be waiting a while in front of the baduk club again. He could just call him and tell him to come out! How frustrating! Taxi! Hello. Can you take me to the Korean baduk club? Yes. [Korean baduk club] Oh! Hello! Shall I get master choi taek for you? He's inside. Or you can go inside if you'd like, sir. No, that's fine. I like watching the rain. It's fine. Oh, I see. Then... Goodbye. Okay, then... for mom, we'll get makeup and for dad... a leather jacket. How's that? Yeah. Sounds like a good idea. How about a dark one? Those gloves are so pretty, right? Pink looks so good on me, too. It's because it's Lee mi Yeon that it looks pretty. Geez, you... Did I ask you to buy them for me? Did I ever say I'd buy them for you? Whatever. I'm going to ask taek. Why would he? Because he has me for secret Santa. He is? Is it you, then? It is you, right? No, it isn't! If it isn't you, it's taek. Please, let it be taek. Who knows? Dad, when did you get here? Not too long ago. Let's go. It's cold. You're going to Pusan tomorrow... I'm worried because it's raining so much. The roads will be slippery. It'll be fine. The match is on Christmas Eve. Your birthday... I think I'll get home really late that day. I'm sorry. I don't need to celebrate my birthday, at this age. Just worry about yourself. Don't worry about me. - Even so... is there anything you want? - No. Nothing. Oh yeah... There's the thing with Ms. park tomorrow, right? Oh... you have the filming tomorrow, right? Sorry... it's something that Ms. park requested, so I couldn't refuse. It's okay. It's Ms. park of all people, after all. She's the president of your fan club, so I should do that much. If she bothers you too much, call me at the hotel. Since I'm close to her, i can say something to her. No, it's fine. She's always been helping us out. It's fine. Yes... that's good. Don't be nervous, just answer Ms. park's questions naturally. Sir, what are you worried about? I'll edit it well, so be at ease. Okay. Thank you. I'm no good with words. I'll only pick out the good parts to use. Let's get started then, shall we? Sir, you're ready, right? Yes. First, we'll start with when choi taek, 6-Dan, was young. Look. Kia will win this game for sure. An Kyung soo... yoo Jae ha... jung duk hwan! When these three meet, nobody compares to them. I bet Samsung electric is going to win. Joon Ji eun. Kim Hyun joon. Oh se hoon. They have a bunch of top notch guys. You damn bastard, you... Oh, what to do? I totally forgot. They have a brand new player, heo Jae! Kim Hyun joon can get 50 points on his own! Hey, you bastard, do you think he'll stand around and do nothing? Look! Heo Jae got over 51 points! Geez... you two are exactly the same. Bo ra, have some oysters. My mother sent these over. I don't want any. Don't have any. There's not enough to go around, anyway. Geez... you're already 20 years old and you're still so damn picky? Hurry up and eat! Your grandmother sent these! Hello? Who's this? Our taekkie! Oh my... our duk seon, getting a call from taek? I wonder what happened. Duk seon's friends are all weak when it comes to taek. They say they have to protect him because he's a national treasure. - Hello, fans from all over the country! - Oh, dad. It's the match between kia and Samsung... The match is starting. Duk seon. I wanted to ask you something. Sure! What? Hey, lower that! I can't hear! Um... it's my dad's birthday on the 24th. Yes, taek? What should I bring as a gift? A gift? Yeah, a gift. What should I buy as a gift? Hey, how could you just ask me something like that up front? Oh... is that right? Even so, I thought it'd be okay if you knew. No eul, I think taek has me! My secret Santa is taek! Aw yes! Oh, really. Wow. Hey, I told you to lower it! I ought to kill you... Lower the volume! I can't hear him! It's my first time buying a present, so I don't know what to get. What should I buy my dad? I have some time before the match tomorrow so I was going to go to the department store. What should I buy? Um... gloves! Gloves? Oh... good idea. What kind of gloves? I don't know a lot about that stuff. Pink ones! Pink gloves are so pretty! Pink gloves? Do you think that'll be okay? Of course it is! I don't think you know, but pink gloves are all the rage lately. Kim Hyun joon... shoot! - Want to die? - Get it! Get it! I told you, I can't hear! Damn it! All right! Kim Hyun joon! My dad will like it, right? My dad and I have never exchanged gifts and stuff, so I'm not even sure how to give him the present after I buy one. Hello? Okay, duk seon. Thanks. Then... I'll see you on Christmas day. What? On Christmas day? When are you getting back? The match is on the 24th. It's ending in Pusan, so it'll probably be past 11:00 P.M. by the time I get home. Oh. I'll wait for you! Don't. What for? It's my choice! Then... I'll drop by to see you for a bit. Don't fall asleep and wait for me. Okay! Okay. Good luck on your match! Okay! Be careful not to catch a cold! Bye! Dad! I'm getting gloves! What gloves? Nothing. Taek is going to buy them for me, that's all. Wow, this kimchi soup is great. Mom, give me some more soup! Sure. So he was a quiet kid even when he was younger? Yes. He was a quiet and gentle kid ever since he was young. He's never put up a fuss, asking you to buy something for him? That's right. He matured so quickly, so... I see. Since choi taek is such a genius his mother must have had a unique conception dream. What was the conception dream that she had? Um, well... I don't quite remember. Mom, I'm going to the study room! Oh, hello, ma'am. Oh, yes, sun woo. Are you going to study? Yes. How come? It's Sunday... Just study at home! I'll make you something yummy. No, it's okay. I'll only be there until the evening. Don't do stuff like this when your wrist is bad! Sheesh! Why won't you go to the doctor already? It's okay if I turn it slowly. Geez... mom! Quit your nagging, already. What about Jin joo? Where did she go? Huh? Oh... she must have gone to play that sugar candy game again! jung bong's dad gave her 100 won before. Wow, he gave her a lot... Can you go get her? She won't listen to me. Okay. I'm off, then. Okay. Goodbye! - Okay, bye. - Yes! Geez. You raised such a good son. Look at him, opening the jar for you because your wrist hurts. You don't need to worry about sun woo, even in the outside world. He does everything he needs to do and takes such good care of his little sister. Just how will you manage to let another woman have him one day? Madam! Don't say that! I'm about to start tearing up already. What's that? You made rice cakes? Yeah. I have way too much rice at home. Let's eat! Okay. Wow, it looks delicious! Geez! I'll make you a yummy one, okay? Hey, guys. I'm taking Jin joo. Jin joo. Is that yummy? I think there's something you promised me, though. Jin joo. Only have that sugar candy once a week. Only on the days that the children's classic story airs, okay? You promised me, right? Hurry and go brush your teeth with your dooly (Cartoon dinosaur) Toothbrush. Then, I'll buy you ice cream in the evening. Mom, I'm really going now. Why the umbrella? Is it raining outside? They said it's going to rain later in the evening. I'm bringing it just in case. Goodbye! Okay! Study up, my son! Where else would you find a son like him? How does one have a child like him? He's just like his father. He did everything by the book. Oh yeah. Madam. Is taek's father's interview over? We should've gone to watch. He barely speaks... I'm sure he's all like, "uh huh huh." The conception dream... I don't quite remember it. I see. What about the future-grabbing ceremony during his first birthday? Did he choose education? Money? A long life? I don't quite remember what he grabbed then, either. I'm sorry. It's okay. We want to see what his fortune for the new year will be. When's his birthday? October 8th, 1971. What about the time? Was it the morning? Afternoon? I'm not quite sure. I'm sorry. That's fine! Dads usually don't know these things, anyway. Hmm... then... about choi taek, 6-Dan... Shall we talk about his habits? Is he the type to be a bit slow at home, too? We heard from his colleagues at the baduk club that he's... Huh? It's really raining! It's so much better than snow! Rain, fall down! Fall down, fall down! Oh no, my sauces! I left the lids open! Oh my god, I must be out of my mind! My laundry! What do I do? Geez! Oh, geez! It seems that choi taek really takes after you. Of course, I'm sure that was only made possible due to you having raised him with so much love and care! You're really amazing! I'm sure raising him alone was no easy feat. When was the most difficult moment in child-rearing for you? I've never had such a moment. My child is an extremely quiet one, so he's never once made me upset. Yes... he's quite a kind son. And finally, any last words to your son? Well, I'd like for him to be healthy... And... well... Having one's health is the most important thing. Well... I'd like to say, "don't get sick" and "be healthy." Tell him that you love him, just once! Oh... no. Just once. Please? No... no. I'm not good at things like that... yes. Mr. choi! Please, just once! Just once. Well... I don't really say things like that, so... I don't... I'm not really good at that... Ms. park, why are you doing this to me? Wow, he must have completely forgotten! He left the door wide open... Where did he go? Excuse me, Mr. choi. Did something happen? I didn't even realize that you came. - Hey. Dong ryong. - Yeah? Go home and sleep. You've been sleeping here for 10 hours. I feel more at ease here. The Dean lives at my house, remember? Go on ahead. I'm going home later. Geez. It's raining outside, right? Yeah. I think so. I love the sound of rain. I like getting hit by the rain. Lies. Why would I lie? I really do like getting hit by the rain. I'll be going on ahead. Hey... sun woo! Hey! I'll come pick up my umbrella tomorrow morning! See you tomorrow! You're not even that good at holding your liquor. What, did you misspeak during the interview today? What is it? What happened that you feel so cruddy? Ms. Kim. Yes? Do you still remember the conception dream you had when you had sun woo? Are you kidding me? Of course. I could dream the same dream tonight if I wanted to. A dragon was flying up in the middle of a waterfall but when it saw me, it turned its head. It had a Jewel about this big... And it threw that onto my skirt before disappearing up the waterfall. What about the time that sun woo was born? - I'm sure you definitely... - 4:57 A.M. Around the time to feed the pigs. I was pleading with him to be born before 5:00 A.M. And then, he popped out exactly three minutes beforehand! He was a filial son from the time he was born, I tell you. But, why do you ask? Why are you asking that out of the blue? Why? Did taek ask? The reporter asked me today. About what his conception dream was and what time he'd been born. There's no way I'd know. I couldn't remember, for the life of me. And because of that, I couldn't answer. I wanted to crawl somewhere and hide. I feel so apologetic toward taek. I feel so apologetic toward my child. Oh, geez. Dads usually don't really know those things! What kind of father would remember all that? If only his mother were here... She would've remembered everything. If his mother were alive she'd know what her conception dream was or what time he'd been born... Or what he'd worn on his first day of elementary school... Just like you. Dads are so useless. If only if his mother had been the one to live instead of me... Taek would've received so much love like the other kids and would've worn nice clothes every season and would've eaten a lot of delicious food. And when he was ill... His mother could've held him tight... Why did I have to be the one to live on? I have nothing to say, really. There's nobody else like you on this planet, Mr. choi. You make him a warm meal every morning. When it rains, you stand and wait for taek outside of the baduk club. You've never even watched TV properly because you were afraid of disturbing him. Taek is aware of all of these things, too. He's such a happy child in the inside because he knows how much his father loves and cherishes him. He's aware of it all! What good is it, whether he knows or not? It's because I feel so bad for my child. I feel so bad for my child... [Two days until Christmas Eve] [One day before the end of secret Santa] You're going to freeze to death like that. You're wearing a Jean skirt in the middle of the winter? You gave up on studying, didn't you? I'm going to start in January, all right? - Mind your own. - As if. Duk seon! Hurry and come out! Are you going to be late on the last day before winter break, too? Okay! You're still here? Yeah. I overslept. Let's go. Hey. Aren't you cold? What are you doing, in the middle of the winter? I'm going to apgujung with my friends after school today. Since I'm going there, i have to dress up at least this much! What if you get sick? And if you go to any part of gangnam today, you'll get trampled to death. Why not just stay home? Why not mind your own business, sir? I mean... um... I'm just saying. What about we watch a video with the crew tonight at taek's? No. I already promised man ok and Jo Hyun. Oh, hey! You guys haven't left yet? Asshole. [First McDonald's in Korea- apujung location] Hey. Everyone else but us is a couple. What's with us? We don't even have a guy with us. Did we ever though? Hey. Call your boyfriend or something. Ask him to buy us burgers or something. I can't believe you! Hey. She says he's not her boyfriend. Apparently he likes someone else. For real? Wait, really? Wow. Why, I ought to... Hey, then... call that other guy who was next to him instead. Yeah! It's so sad with just us girls here. Let's call him over and play together. Who? Call the baduk boy. Baduk boy! Choi taek. I'll only look and not touch, I promise. He went to Pusan and he won't be back until tomorrow night. Should I call dong ryong? You know, the one with the glasses. Forget him. Oh, yeah! Can't we call him? You know, the tall skinny kid with the narrow eyes. Who? Oh... oh, the one who was next to the student body president? The scary looking one? You mean jung hwan? Kim jung hwan? Even he would be fine. It'd be better than us eating alone. He looked totally loaded, too, so tell him to buy us some burgers. He definitely won't come. Why not? I'll just be happy if he doesn't curse me out while I ask. - He has a nasty-ass temper! - But still... give him a call, at least! Yeah, he might actually come! I thought he was your friend! I don't want to. He's going to give me so much crap over it. Hey. You can't even make a phone call for a friend? Is that the kind of relationship we have? Mom, I'm going to the city for a bit. To hang out? No, to buy something. Will you be late? I'm made the crab stew you like for dinner. No, I'll be back soon. Let's eat dinner together. Oh my! Are you going somewhere, Jin joo? Do you have a dinner appointment with someone today? I'll take Jin joo with me. Jin joo. Do you love me or not? I love you! I'll be back, mom! Oh, my children... Hello. Oh, sun woo! Where are you going, Jin joo? Are you going on a date with your older brother? You have to answer "yes." Yes. What about jung hwan, though? Excuse me? You're not going with jung hwan? He just dressed and left too. Hey... why are you here? What? You told me to come. Order what you guys want. What do you want to eat? Um... I want the filet-o-fish and French fries... and a cola. Me too. Um... what did she order, exactly? Oh... it's hard to understand what she's saying, right? A filet-o-fish, French fries, and a cola. We can get a combo, right? It's a bit more expensive, though... Sure. Go ahead. It's fine. What do you want? Oh. I want... the double burger and a large cola... and fries, and ice cream. You're doing it again! You can't even finish it all, and you're being so greedy. Eat first, then order more. You always think with your stomach, not your brain. You have no sense of self-control. Just get the burger and the cola. Got it? I'm going to the bathroom. - Um, excuse me... - Yes? You seem to be quite close with duk seon. You came here so quickly after she called you. Um, it's not that... I thought she was by herself. I'll go and order. Okay. What the heck? I think it's for real this time! Totally! Sing it, sing it! Hurry! Let's go! - What is it? - Hurry! - Did something huge happen? - Yes! What is it, already? What is it, already? The weather forecast changed. They say it won't rain tomorrow or the day after. Who the hell cares? The snowman, remember? What are we going to do about the snowman? Oh yeah. Does anyone have any ideas? We already made a promise to her that we'd get her a snowman even though they say it won't snow at all. What do we do? Okay. Make any suggestions that come to mind. Even if it's kind of silly, just say it anyway. Go ahead. Okay. How about this? Put Jin joo to sleep on the night of the 24th... And then wake her up on the morning of the 26th! See, then there will be no need to make a snowman! Because there won't be a 25th. Just stop. We can tell Jin joo "Jin joo... the snowman melted while you were sleeping!" "Why didn't you wake up?' ow! I'm sorry. I've never heard a more idiotic idea in my life. Jesus Christ. Oh! Can't we just make her any kind snowman? It doesn't have to be made with snow. We can make it with paper or the stuffing from our blankets! Sorry for being late! No, it's fine! It's not like your ice store has any business now... why are you always late? What were you doing? I had to make a delivery. Oh! That's right! Ice! We can make it for her with ice! Right? Oh my. You're right! We can use ice! Instead of that, put her to sleep on the 24th, and... Ice! Yes! Great idea! We can carve it into a snowman! Mr. choi here has a lot of talent when it comes to things like that! It's possible, right? Oh... well, I've never made that before, but I don't think it'll be difficult. That's right! Wow! Then, can you spare us some ice from your store? I'm sure nobody is buying ice in this weather, anyway. - Or give it to us for cheap, at least. - No, it's fine! Nobody is buying much, anyway. I'll put two containers of it out front by tomorrow. Yes, thank you! Okay, then. Let's all meet here tomorrow. Have a good dinner, everyone. And merry Christmas in advance! Okay, that concludes our meeting! Wow, our neighborhood really is something! Oh my! What have you been thinking about? Did you leave something behind? Why are you acting so serious? Did you do something bad? Hey, jung hwan. What? You... Have me for secret Santa, don't you? How strange. Taek has me, though. Why would I have you for secret Santa? You only came because you had me for secret Santa. Would you have come to gangnam otherwise? Are you out of your mind? Even I know that much. I don't have you for secret Santa. Stop trying to convince me otherwise. I have taek for secret Santa. Want me to show you the slip of paper I have at home? Why did you come today? What? What? Are you really out of your mind? Use this head of yours and give it some serious thought about why I came. Got it? What's with him? Seriously! What? [A charming adolescence] Hello! This is a festival celebrating the youth, romance, and dreams of young people! This is mbc's 1988 campus music festival! I'm your host, Lee taek lim! Hello! I'm his cohost, Kim eun joo! We'll be presenting a lot of songs that represent the passion burning in these college students' hearts! The campus music festival is constantly improve due to the new ideas that have sprung forth from younger generations! Should we play a game to see who's the winner? Sure. Sounds good. How much should we bet? How about 1000 won per person? Each person will put in 1000 won, and the winner will take everything. Wow. You could totally be an mc! jung bong. Yeah? Stop giving people false hope and just watch quietly. Wow... I didn't know Mr. choi was so skilled with his hands! Wow... it's a masterpiece! You could close your jewelry store and become a sculptor! He used to carve people's personal seals! He's a real artisan! But he doesn't have a nose, a mouth, or eyes. He has no character. - Yeah. - Yeah. Should we use the black stones, or the white stones? I like the black stones! I like the white stones. I guess he won't have matching eyes. Huh? What are you doing? Don't do that! It'll melt! With the temperature this low? No way. Don't worry. It's fine. Wow, look at that! My Jin joo will be so happy tomorrow morning! She'll totally believe that Santa brought this for her! Geez... look how much we went through for a little girl! At any rate... It's cold out and it's late, so why not have a drink? - Yes! - Okay. Then we'll stay at sun woo's and watch some TV! How about we have a drink, too? It's so cold! Let's go already instead of stating the obvious! Let's go! Yes, let's go! I guess dong ryong's dad has something to take care of. Yes, this is joo byung sun, from Seoul. The song he will sing is called "dolmen!" I'm calling number 11! Me too! I'm calling number 11, too! There's still five teams left. It'll be 11 for sure. He has such charisma! I think it'll be number three, Jeon soo Kyung! Wow... I was thinking the same thing! Doesn't it seem a bit boring this year? Nobody has left an impact on me. Hey. All songs are like that when you hear it the first time. There's no song that wows you on the first listen! I think it'll be number one. Are you Beethoven or something? You actually remember their song? Yeah. I think she was pretty. - Geez! - What? Oh yeah... isn't it your birthday today, Mr. choi? Oh yeah, it really is. Then we have to do a special congratulatory toast for you! Here. Cheers! My wife was making seaweed soup this morning. It's your birthday today... You're not having a party with your son? What party, at our age? Geez... just looking at the number of candles on the cake on my birthday gets me all depressed. That's right. After I passed 40 years old, I stopped looking forward to my birthdays. I just get depressed. What are we supposed to do though? We have to watch our kids grow up. You're really drinking a lot today... Is something the matter? No. When is taek coming home? Even so, it's your birthday... It'd be nice to have dinner together. He's coming back from Pusan now. I got a call from him this morning. Taek is such a busy kid... He doesn't have time for that stuff. Isn't that right? The mere fact that he grew up so well is enough of a present... Isn't it? Yes. I'm so thankful for even just that. I was only able to give him half the love he deserved, raising him alone. Even so, he grew up so well. That's not true. You loved him twice as much for his mom's sake. Don't say things like that. If taek were to hear that, he might cry. He's just being humble! Geez. What good would 10 parents be? They couldn't compare to Mr. choi when it comes to loving their child. He's just being damn humble. Here, here! Let's make a toast! Pour me a glass too. Okay. Cheers! What's with this mood, when it's Christmas today? I'll sing us a song! Don't you dare, damn you. Is Jin joo sleeping? Yes. She was playing so much with her brother, and now she's fast asleep. Jin joo's so lucky. The entire neighborhood came out to prepare her a Christmas gift. She's blessed! She'll never forget this Christmas present, right? She'll forget about it by next year. Kids can't remember anything. Why are you being so negative? When I was young, there wasn't even such a thing as Christmas. My mom spent all night before my birthday making a doll out of scraps of cloth. We had no money, so she used whatever scraps of cloth there were lying around! And I still remember the day that I saw that doll so clearly! We'll just see if it ends up being a present that Jin joo remembers forever! Really? Let's drink to that, then. - Cheers! - Cheers! Geez... it's so great, with the three of us being together. I still think it'll be number 11. - And I still think it'll be number 14! - Me too! I think it'll be close, but... I think it'll be number 7. - As for me... number 15! - Me too. - Don't copy me! - I'm not! What will it be? There's only one team left. - There is only one team left tonight. - Geez... - The last team... - Hey! Number 16... from Seoul, it's endless orbit! Endless orbit... You're the last performer tonight. What were you thinking while you waited? I wasn't thinking about much else... I was just thinking about how much i wanted to go home soon and see my mother. Okay, then... presenting number 16, endless orbit, from Seoul! Their song is called "to that person!" [Endless orbit: Seoul university, yeonsei university, seogang university] [Title: To that person] - Number 16! - No, I'm calling number 16! - No, me! - Me, me, me! - I'm calling it. - No, I am. 16! I'm calling 16! Even in moments when we're living a fast-paced life - me! Me! - No, me! We're both left feeling so disappointed I want use the many days i have left in my life to spend them with you even if I were to lose everything that I love I could never let you go no matter where I am in this world, i can feel your breath I want to stay by your side until the day that my life ends [to that person, who has found their way and has left...] [Endless orbit] Bo ra! It's me, sun woo. Can I see you for a bit? What is it, already? What is this? A present. Hey. I told you not to inconvenience me any further. You're making me really uncomfortable, giving me something like this. Bo ra. I'm your secret Santa. We're supposed to exchange presents for that today. I'll be going, then. Oh yeah. Merry Christmas. Taek! Taekkie! Hey. There's only 30 minutes left. Huh? Today! There's only 30 minutes until today is over! It really is 11:30 P.M. already, huh? Duk seon, I'll be going ahead. Hey, choi taek! What about the gloves? I bought them. Thanks to you, i was able to pick good ones. I think my dad will love them. Really, thanks a ton. Dad. Did you drink? Please, go inside and sleep. You're home, my son? What about dinner? I ate. It's late, after all. Oh. Yeah. Wash up and go to sleep. You've worked hard, my son. Dad. Here. What's this? A birthday present for you. Happy birthday, dad. Open it. It's your birthday, but I couldn't have dinner with you. I'm sorry. Dad... You know that i love you so much, right? Dad... What's wrong? Oh... When did my son grow up this much? Hmm? You're even so considerate of your father. You've really grown up, huh? You're all grown up now, my son! Geez... my kind and smart son... I, too... Taek... Oh, geez. I... only have you, taek. Duk seon... what are you doing here? Did you fight with Bo ra again? No eul. I guess nobody picked my name. I don't even have a secret Santa. I guess I'm someone who doesn't even deserve to be loved. Isn't taek your secret Santa? I thought he was buying you gloves. They weren't for me. They were for his dad. Wow. - Should I just kill him? - You can't! He lost today. Just barely, too. So don't cause him too much trouble and just let it slide. I'm pretty sure he doesn't even remember that we're doing secret Santa. He has no time to be worrying about such things right now. [Duk seon] Duk seon. I'm sorry. I totally forgot. I'm really sorry. About what? Your secret Santa... was me. Right? You are my secret Santa, right? Yeah. It's me. But I totally forgot about it. I'm really sorry. It's okay. You have more important things to be worrying about right now. Also, I didn't have much interest in secret Santa anyway. Everyone else did it, so I was just a bit intrigued by it, is all... it's okay. What do you want as a gift? I'll buy you anything you want. No, it's okay. Hurry up and tell me. I'm counting to three. One... Gloves! Pink gloves. Made of angora. Okay. Got it. I'll buy you the same ones as my dad's. Hurry and go home. It's cold. Okay. Good night. You too. It's a warm Christmas morning. It's two degrees celsius in Seoul, it's four degrees in Gwangju and jeonju. Meanwhile, it's three degrees in Southern chungcheong. Gosh... I don't feel too good. I knew this would happen. You drank so much yesterday! Do you want to take some medicine? No, it's fine. I'll just bear it, I guess. Anyway... where did the kids go? I let them sleep in since it's their vacation. I heard it's cold today, but it seems warm. Yeah... um... Did you hear it raining last night, by any chance? I thought I did. What rain? I didn't hear anything. Last night, there was rain in the Seoul area. There was an abnormal amount of rain despite the season... Wow. You were right! You drank so much, so how did you manage to hear that? I'm good like that. Still, rain is better than snow. Everything cluttering the streets must have gotten washed away, so it's great... About 60 millimeters of rain fell last night until the morning in the Gyeonggi region. In the pyungtaek and yongsan districts, about 50 millimeters of rain fell. About 61 millimeters of rain fell in yeoncheon. And approximately 40 millimeters of rain fell in incheon. The most rain fell in the jeju island region, about 94 millimeters. In the Southern parts of Korea, 30 to 40 milliliters of rain fell. As the rain stopped, the temperature went down and will continue come down more during the weekend. Oh dear. Oh, gosh... what is this? What do we do? What about Jin joo? She's still sleeping. She'll be so disappointed. What do we do? What else? We have to try to entice her with some snacks that she likes. Is something the matter? Oh... Jin joo asked for a snowman for Christmas so we spent all night making her one. But it melted. It'd be difficult to re-make it now, right? Oh, geez... what do we do? I feel so bad for her. She said that she wanted a snowman? Yeah. Your sister said she wanted a snowman for Christmas but it melted... what do we do now? They sell those at dooly supermarket. They sell snowmen at the dooly supermarket. What are you talking about? Jin joo calls ice cream "snowmen." Should I go buy some? How many? Wow, a snowman! It just may be because of the sons and daughters of this world that the people of the world began to have faith in religions due to their parents, who wished for their happiness and well-being above all else. God, Buddha, Allah, and Santa must exist for the sake of all of the mothers and fathers in this world as well as their children. Duk seon. For you. What is it? A present. Huh? Oh my god! When did he even buy these? The department stores are probably not even open yet! Is taek still outside? He didn't leave yet, right? Taek isn't the one who gave that to me. jung hwan did. He says it's your Christmas present. He must be out of his mind. Damn it. I was at the age when I no longer believed in Santa or felt my heart flutter because of secret Santa. I was at an age age when a present that was secretly left behind or secretly conveyed gentleness wasn't enough to fulfill my expectations. Excitement that would probably escape up to the back of my throat and choke me if i were to try and suppress it. Embarrassment that would probably make my heart explode if I were to admit to it. I was dying to make it obvious, but didn't want to get caught. That was the excitment we felt back in 1988. We were 18 years old back then. You're here today, huh? Oh... yes. That's good. Ms. park said that this is for you. She said it's your Christmas present. It looked like a videotape. Anyway, I'll be going now. Also, sleep at home on days like today! Okay? Bye. Master choi taek, this is my Christmas gift to you. I'm not sure if you'll like it, but I secretly edited this all night so please enjoy it! It's a special video that doesn't exist anywhere else in the world! I hope you have a merry Christmas, and that you have a great record next year! From master choi taek's forever-fan, park Ji eun. Oh, no... no. I'm not good at doing things like that. Come on. Please? Just once. Just once! Well... I don't really do things like that, so... So... um... I'm sorry. Ms. park, why are you doing this to me? Then, I won't air this part. Just consider it practice, and just say it once. Without the camera... yes. Geez... at times like this, i don't like you too much, Ms. park. Why? It's because you two always seem too stoic. Just say it to me once, as practice! Say, "i love you" just once. Okay? Well, I can say that... yeah. Exactly! What's so hard about it? Go ahead and say it. Please? I love you, son. Oh my! You said it so readily, too! One more time. Just one more time. I love you, my son. See, you're so good at it! You should say it to him on a regular basis. I'm not that good at it, but you kept asking me to... Time continues on. That's why time eventually creates farewells and it always leaves people with regrets. How nice would it be if you said this to him all the time? Oh geez. At any rate, you were great today! Ah, yes... Oh, the camera. Thank you! If you love someone, you have to tell them now before your fleeting days become filled with regret. In some ways, the biggest present that time leaves us with is the memories we have of loving others. That's why you have to shove embarrassment aside and confess your love to the one you love before it's too late. Do you think I'm an idiot? It wasn't you? I'm going to tell mom everything! Mom... Fix the color of that hair of yours first, girl! It wasn't me, mom! It really wasn't me! Well... if you like sung Bo ra, you're not exactly of sound mind. Hi, Bo ra. That's "hello" to you, punk. Hello. What are you doing? I'll give you all of this. I don't need it anymore. If only it wasn't for that surgery... jung bong, it's mom. Mom is so strong... But her son's body is so weak...
