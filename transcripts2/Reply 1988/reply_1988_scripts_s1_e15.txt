 Bo-ra. Come have lunch at my place today and bring your siblings. Excuse me? We're tired of cooking, so we are protesting. We are going out to eat for the first time in a while. Gather all the kids on the block and have lunch here, okay? But there's a lot of them. They'd be fine feeding for themselves. Don't worry, Mother. Why worry when you have your eldest son? Okay, then. Make sure they eat. I'll leave you some money. Yes, Mother! Anything good happen to you? No.

 You're seeing someone, right? No. Jeez, you're so bad at lying. Look at me straight in the eye and say it. You're seeing someone, right? No. Definitely not. I can see it in your eyes. Best of luck to you, Jung-bong. Good luck! No way. Kim Jeong-ryul. You're seeing someone? Congrats! I'm off to work. I left you money. Buy food, okay? Yes, Mother! Or order jjajangmyun for dinner! Okay. I had that for dinner yesterday. Hey, Dong-ryong! Did you hear everything? Indeed! I heard everything from when you said, "Don't worry, Mother." I knew this, but you really have an incredible sense of hearing. Indeed I do. Thank you! I get that a lot. It's a secret! Okay! I'll see you for lunch later at your place! Bo-ra, can you pass me your dad's shirt? Mom, throw this out. The neck is all worn out. Right? We'll have to buy him a new one with his paycheck this month. Lift your butt for a second. Wow! It turned out so well! Better than ironing it! Bo-ra, your part-time job ends next week, doesn't it? Did you talk to your upperclassman? Yeah, he said that it's fine. He's a good guy. Okay. I'm so happy nowadays. I feel like I could fly! No-eul, can you excuse me? I need to talk to Mom and Dad. I'll prepare to take the bar. That's a great decision, Bo-ra. Good decision. I promised to work, so I'll be working for a month. They need time to find my replacement. Yes, of course. So you'll only work for a month and then start preparing for the bar? Yes, Bo-ra, don't worry about anything from now on. Finish that part-time job, and focus on your studies. Don't you worry about money or anything other than that. Your dad and I can support you fine, okay? My daughter, you really shouldn't worry about anything else now, okay? Okay. Also, keep this a secret for the time being. From my siblings, and from other people. That will bother me. Okay! No problem! Until you're done with your part-time job and begin your studying, we won't say a single word about it. Don't worry! Yeah, don't you worry. Bo-ra, you've made the right choice. You've made... the right choice. Yes, put it on like that! I guess you really don't get much exercise. You look it. Well, Sun-woo. Honestly, I-- I'll go easy! I'll pretend you're Jin-ju and throw it gently. Is this distance good? No, it's not. Actually, you're a bit too close. Don't close your eyes. You are a bit athletic. -Well-- -It's still too close. Do you want to throw it from there? We're a bit too close. This far? I think you'll have to walk a bit further. Here? This is too far, though. I'll throw it now. Okay. You've watched too many baseball games. Strike! Jin-ju, have fun with Mr. Choi, okay? I'll buy you the bread you like at the market. You're here? Having lunch this late? I was about to eat whatever. You didn't go to the market yet? I'm just about to. Jin-ju had lunch. You don't need to feed her. Okay. Go and eat delicious things. And have fun. You've done nothing but work at that bathhouse. What is that? You don't even have soup? I like kimchi. This is good enough. But you are a patient! Is there anything you want to eat? I'll cook. I'll get ingredients while I'm out. What I want to eat? I've had a hankering for this lately. What? What is it? Cucumber kimchi. Jeez, you've got such an unrefined palate. If there are good cucumbers, I'll pick some up. Okay. Did you have fun? Yes. Mr. Choi is really different than he seems. My arm almost broke off. How unexpected. Let's meet up later-- -I don't want to eat! -Dong-ryong! Why don't you eat at home? I told you, I don't want to eat! I caught a whiff of a good smell... an amazing smell here. -I'm sorry. -Bye. -Let's go! -Damn it! I told you, I don't want to eat! Yeah, right! Come up! I won't eat! Oh! It's not finished yet? Do you need help? Ten more seconds! -Aren't we having jjajangmyun? -That's what I thought. I was tired of it, so I asked for something else. What gives you the right? Do you know what the most important thing is nowadays? Information. I have that. Information is the most important thing in this age. -It's almost as valuable as money. -Hey. -Money is something that comes and goes. -Hey. I'm sorry. -Let's eat quietly. -Okay. -Got it? -Yes. Put something down on the table! Wow. Looks delicious. -It's kimchi fried rice. -I wondered what it could be. Will this be enough for everyone? Doesn't look like much. Put something down on the table! Okay, then. How are we supposed to eat all of this? Looks delicious. You know how to make this? Of course. Anyone can make this. This is the one dish my dad can make. Thanks for the food! Do you have anything else you want to eat, Dong-ryong? No, I don't. I like anything cooked at home. Where did Jung-hwan go? He went to go borrow a video. I told him to go borrow Amadeus. -Oh. -I'm home. Is today a holiday again? Come sit! Your brother makes amazing food. So good. -Quick. It's going to get cold. -Come sit. Hurry up and sit! What are you waiting for? Sit. Taek went to the Go-game club today, too? The Dongyang Cup has begun. Next week is the finals of the Ing Cup. It's a five-game match. If he wins this time, he'll be the victor. What's a five-game match? Hey. If you wipe that off, I'll tell you. What? {\an8}THE FOURTH DONGYANG SECURITIES MATCH MATCH LIST DOBONG DISTRICT HEAD, ASSEMBLYMEN INTERVIEWS KBS NEWS, KBS DOCUMENTARY, UBS NEWS What's that? Master Choi's passionate fans. Those who wish to play Go-game with him. There's no way he'd agree to it. I know. I'll be lucky to bring it up with him. Hello? Oh, Producer Choi! Hey, don't be a stranger. Please save my life just this once. I really need an interview with Mr. Choi! You said you two were close! Of course, I'd ask him if I could, but he really won't agree to something like this. Still, bring it up to him just once! He hates making requests and receiving them, too! He really only cares about Go-- Fine. Don't get your hopes up. Okay. Okay. Producer Choi from UBS? Yeah. He's helped us out with the public Go-games. The broadcast last year was all thanks to him, too. I do owe him one. Master Choi will never agree to do it. If I had put this stone here first, could I have won? Yes. How does it look? It seems that black has a small advantage. I thought that I had the advantage. {\an8}MARKET NOODLE HOUSE 100 WON FOR ONE Hello! -Please give us three noodles. -Okay. When we first fell in love He was a tough man Looks nice. It's a great buy. How come you buy pajamas for your husband? Seeing him naked is an eyesore. Oh, that's enough! That's way too much! That's fine! It's way too much! Wow, do you even make a profit? -Can we have some kimchi, too? -Of course. Making seasoned blood clams is so much work! It takes too long to peel and put the sauce in each one. My husband and Bo-ra both like them. It lasts a few days once I make it. Oh my, the chives! You're not making chive pancakes? Those are so much work. Chopping them makes my arm hurt. I will say there weren't any today. They'll buy that. Sun-young, why did you buy so many cucumbers? Making cucumber kimchi? Yes, I've been craving it lately. Your anchovy stock is perfect today! It's delicious! Thank you. It's really great today! How much was the food? No! Don't. I'll pay. I have some money now. I, as the youngest, will buy you vending machine coffee! It's fine. You pay next time. I don't need the change. Oh, no! I can't do that again. Please, take your change. Here. No, it's fine! We all ate about 1,000 won worth! We ate so much! Please, take it! -Bye. -I'll just take one of these, okay? Bye! Bye! Bo-ra! Soo-yeon! No-eul! Fold up your blankets! I'm bringing the food in! How come you didn't call my name? Dong-il, let's eat! Okay! Gosh. Come on out, everyone. Get your asses here before I count to three! One! Two! I'm here. Jung-hwan, put out the silverware. Mom, I want a younger sibling. Shut up. Let's go. It's Jung-hwan's wish. Jeez! Chopsticks. Hurry up. I need a younger sibling. The kimchi stew turned out really well. Looks good. Eat, Mom. Okay. I will. I thought you were making cucumber kimchi. I washed them. I'm going to make it tomorrow. Eat now. Well... why don't you invite Mr. Choi, too? Taek will be late tonight anyway. For what? He eats well alone. How come there's no place for us when they build so many apartments? Dad, when are we moving? I want to live in an apartment, too. More than half my friends live in apartments now. Okay. Just wait a bit longer. I'm working hard to make money. Sorry. It's okay, Dad. I'll earn tons of money later and buy you a nice house. Have faith in me. I will buy one. Worry about getting into college first. If you can't get into college even after changing your name, I'll kill you with my own two hands. Got that? What's the big deal if she can't get into a college? Soo-yeon is so pretty, smart, and kind! Tomorrow is Soo-yeon's college interview. Already? They usually do it at the beginning of the semester. Don't pass out tomorrow after seeing her grades. -Hey! -"Hey"? You little... Still, I'm sure there are some colleges out there that'll take her. I'm not hoping for you to get into a good school. Okay? You shouldn't be expecting her to get into any college. Hey! Why, I ought to... Thank you for the meal. I'm going to get some fresh air. That's Soo-yeon's greatest trait. She's immature sometimes, but she always makes those around her feel better. She's very cutesy, too. I'm jealous of that. Everyone likes Deok-sun. She's pretty, cute, and is always smiling. She has a charm that makes everyone feel better. Unlike me. She even hugs and kisses Dad without any hesitation. How does she do that? You don't do that with your dad? Never. I could never do that. Now that you mention it, you don't seem close with your dad. Did something happen between you two? No! Nothing happened. There was nothing. My personality is probably to blame for this. My personality is a bit... you know. You must be suffering too, dating me. I like you, though. I think your personality is better than Soo-yeon's. I really am a crazy bastard, aren't I? Yeah. Are you drunk? DEPOSIT: 80,000 WON Honey, my salary isn't even that high. Are you already putting it away? It's great that we can finally save some money. I never thought I'd be able to put away 80,000 won every month. Oh, dear, we're finally done suffering! Oh, yeah. This plan really is the one with the highest interest, right? I'm telling you, it is! I told you many times. That's the one with the highest rate at our bank, 17 percent! By the way... anything going on between you and Bo-ra? What are you talking about? I feel like you two aren't close. So I wonder if you two got into a fight a while back or something. Stop talking bullshit! How can there be a fight between a parent and a child? I mean... you act so differently around Soo-yeon and No-eul. Well, Bo-ra was a bit different as an eldest since she was younger. Stop talking nonsense! And I'm so close with Bo-ra! She's my eldest! You're talking complete nonsense! You'll ruin your ears. Lift your head. So absurd! Sticky rice cakes for sale! Buckwheat jelly for sale! Sticky rice cakes for sale! Go home. Good night. Sun-woo. Shall we meet somewhere else, next Sunday? How about we have a cup of that Vienna coffee that's all the rage lately? What's this? I feel uneasy. You don't have to. Keep the promise, okay? Damn. Who's calling at this hour? Hello? What? You crazy bastard. Okay. Ouch, it hurts! Shush. Mr. Choi will wake up. Did you get beat up by a thug? He rides a motorcycle now. Are you out of your mind? Be quiet! I told you not to follow Michol around. He is a pro! He's been riding since he was in tenth grade! Why are you... rebelling now? How are you going to go home? Taek gets home late, but he'll be up all night because of his match. You can't sleep here. Like this! I can just... do this and go home. You all know how my family is. They're all asleep. I just have to make sure I don't get caught in the morning. Isn't your mom really scary when she gets mad? Chief Jo is busy. I think she'll be promoted soon. Isn't that amazing? Wow, how exciting. How amazing. Hey, Jung-hwan! Taek's going to come home, so leave the light on! Okay. You came dressed like that? It's right there. Let's go. Soo-yeon, take this to Taek's house! Okay. Hello! Here are some seasoned blood clams. Oh, really? Thanks. What about Taek? Did he come home late? Yeah, he came home early this morning. Really? He's good at soccer, too? Yeah! There's no sport he isn't good at. He just looks like a bear. He's good at basketball, soccer, baseball, ssireum, all of that! What have I been doing? Why didn't he tell me that? He probably was trying to. But you know how slow he is. Sun-woo. Don't you dare bet or anything with Mr. Choi. He is way too competitive. Who do you think Taek took after? His dad, for sure. Mom, I think he's really a great guy. What? I mean, I'm just saying. I like him. What does that have to do with me? Why are you saying that? No reason. I'll be going now. Jin-ju, I'm leaving! I'm off to school. Soo-yeon, it's 2:00 p.m. today, right? How long are you going to call her that? We're going to forget our daughter's pretty name, Deok-sun! I won't give up. Soo-yeon! Should I go to the interview room? Yes, Mother. Then, I'll be going. Okay. I'm leaving, too. Okay. Throw that shirt out after today. The collar is all worn out. What will people think? Who would care about a geezer like me? Also, I can just button it tightly, like this. Look. Like this. I'm off! Hello? Is anyone here? Nobody is here, but I'm off. SSANGMUN GIRLS' HIGH Ja-hyun, you're next. Your parents are here. You're next, Woo Hee-hyun. Sung Soo-yeon. It's your turn. MONDAY MATH, SOCIAL STUDIES, PHYSICS Math, Social Studies, Physics, English, Korean, Science, and PE. PE, oh yes! Hey? Why don't you change? SSANGMUN HIGH SELF STUDY 103 COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE STATS FOR 1989 -Teacher. -Yes? I'm not even hoping for her to get into a good college. I just want her to get into a four year one. Anywhere is fine. Her dad and I aren't really setting the bar too high. With Soo-yeon's current grades, admission to any four year college will be difficult. -Oh. -A four year college is out of her reach. Colleges in Seoul are pretty much out of the question. I see. Ma'am, she has one year left. If she starts studying hard now, she still has some hope. It all depends on how hard she works from now on. There are 400 students whose grades are lower than Soo-yeon's. I'll pay more attention to her. Go in. I will go now. Go back and study. Mom! I'm sorry! Deok-sun. I'm fine. Go back to your classroom. Mom, have you given up on me? Have you? Why are you calling me Deok-sun? I'm Soo-yeon, Mom! I'm so sorry, Mom! I'm so sorry, Mom. It's okay. It's okay, Deok-sun. KOREAN GO-GAME CLUB It's almost 11:00 p.m. Go home. Oh... yes. Master Choi. Yes? I'd usually refrain from asking anything of you, but there's a guy, Producer Choi from UBS. He's helped the Club out quite a bit. Master Choi. Can you do an interview? Just 30 minutes! There won't be cameras. It'll just be an interview. He won't ask you about anything else besides Go-game. I'm begging you. Please? It's all because you are the top player. Sorry, I'm a bit late. Yeah... Did something happen? My bag was stolen on the way back. What? You know the hill near the barber shop on three-way road? While I was going up on that hillside, a motorcycle sped down the hill. The person on that motorcycle stole my purse. Jeez! I thought my arm would get ripped off! Are you hurt anywhere? Is your arm okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm just a bit shaken up. I'm not hurt. I always take that road! Now I'm too scared to take it! Oh, my. What about Jin-ju? Is she sleeping? I'll go get her. No, I'll go get her. No, it's fine. I'll go get her. I keep thinking that I'm going to drop. Hello, ma'am. Yes. Excuse me, but what are you doing out so late? Mind your own business. I will, ma'am. Be safe. You two go ahead. I'm going to Dooly Supermarket. But it's closed. You're coming home now? Did you cause trouble again? Mind your own. You little-- Jung-hwan, I'm going to go see Michol. If the dean or Chief Jo look for me, tell them I'm at Taek's. Stop riding those motorcycles. You're not even good at it. Do you know the rush that comes with riding in the wind on a motorcycle? What are you talking about? Wipe your snot. Deok-sun. What are you doing here? Did something happen? No. Just getting home? Does your head hurt again? Did you lose today? Why do you have no energy? Oh. She's heading out early even on Saturday. Mister, my mom wanted you to have this. Okay. Taek's not asleep, is he? No, he's awake. Ing Cup match is next week, right? Yeah. Is it over if you win this one? Will you be confessing to Deok-sun, then? You totally read my mind. That's easy. You have time tomorrow? Huh? Let's hang out with everyone before you go to China. We haven't been getting together. How about Monopoly? Okay. -Sun-woo? -Yes? Aren't you going to school? Oh, crap! I'm leaving! No way. You're really giving this to me? -You don't want it? -I do. Thanks, Bo-ra. Here. Allowance. Wow, no way. Thanks. She got her paycheck from her part-time job. It's her first and last paycheck. Why? You're not working anymore? You don't need to know. This is for you, Mom. Oh, wow. For me, too? It's a cheap one. We're late. Soo-yeon. Off to school! Bye. Okay. I'm running late too. Bo-ra, I'm going. Your dad is going. Okay? -Have a good day! -Okay! He can leave later on Saturday. Maybe something's up? Mom. Yeah? What is it? I'm off to school. Okay, my second son. -You have so many woes. -Not really. Get up! Get up now! Go outside and exercise or something! If you like the sofa so much, take the sofa as your wife! Okay. I can exercise. Shall I give Il-hwa a call? Byeon Kang-Soe 3 has come out. I'm using the phone right now! Oh, okay. Jeez. OK: 986-87... To: Ok Spring is already here, as the thick waves of heat are rising and the frogs croak together in harmony. Miss Mi-ok. If you have time, I'd like to have a cup of Vienna coffee with you at 2:00 p.m this Sunday at Banjul's first floor cafe in Jongno. Miss Mi-ok, do you know this? Vienna is the capital city of Austria, but the capital city of my heart is you. Hello? Hello? Who is this? If you've called, you should say something. Hello? Who makes prank calls first thing in the morning? -Damn it! -Oh, no. Grow up. It wasn't me. It wasn't me. So immature. Grow up! Okay? Grow up! What's wrong? It's here! Deok-sun! Soo-yeon! What's wrong? Why are you running? Have you lost your mind? Can you give this to your friend? Oh, okay! I will. Don't worry. Mister, just a moment. Just ten seconds. I'll give it to her. Don't worry and go. -Thank you! -Okay. Thank you! Soo-yeon, I mean, Deok-sun. I can call you Deok-sun now, right? Do your legs hurt? Sit here. I'm fine. You sit. Okay. Thanks. -Have a seat here. -No, it's fine. -I insist, sir. -Thank you. Give me your bag. Thank you. You too, Miss. Oh, thank you. Why are we going to school so early on a Saturday? Seniors should have rights! Protect our rights! We are not machines! You don't even study. You have no shame. You have no compassion. Nice to ride a bus that's not too crowded. Much better than a crammed one. Hold on. Okay. KOREAN GO-GAME CLUB Master Choi. They're here. They're setting up in the special match room, so stay here. I'll call you when they're ready. Just 30 minutes, I promise. Oh, hi, Jin-ju! I borrowed Young Goo and Ddengchil II. You'll be late. Go. Okay. Isn't it better to take weekends off? I get paid double on weekends though! Sun-woo is a senior now, so he comes home late on Saturdays, too. Also, word has been getting around that I'm a good worker, and I've gotten so many job offers lately! Working is good, but take care of your health, too. Bye, then. Thank you as always. Oh, stop. Hello! What are you doing this late? Exercising. We're about that age where we should be exercising. You need to work out a bit! Your belly is so squishy. Buy yourself one of these. Do you know how to use one? No, I've never tried it. It seems easy, but it's actually quite difficult. Would you like to try? Sure. Does this... help you get exercise? Chief Lee, what happened? I thought they weren't taking any photos! What's up with him? Seriously... I heard that you have a great relationship with your father. Also that your father cooks. What's his best dish? What is it? What are you doing this late? Come in. You're going to get hurt! Do it when it's light out! My back! -Honey! -My back! Honey! SSANGMUN HIGH Give me some lead. I told you, I don't have any. Sun-woo, lead. Taek's room, tomorrow. Why? We have to have one last hurrah before he goes to China. Let's play Monopoly. Taek is so lucky. He's surrounded by people who love him. Jung-hwan. I'm sure that I can't go to college anyway. Should I ask Taek to get me a good job? He got sponsors. I'll get hired easily if he puts in a good word for me. He hates asking favors more than anything. He didn't go even at the president's request. Stop bothering him and study. How do you know everything about Taek? But you don't know what I hate, do you? Do you? NEVER GIVE UP Oh, so you are connecting that way? Over here. -Um... -Yeah? Why is X this? Use the quadratic formula. X equals -B plus and minus radical B squared minus 4AC over 2A. This is Tenth Grade level. It's the quadratic equation. Okay. I'm asking because I don't know. Don't be mad. A is one, B is eight, and C is 12, so-- Why is A one? The constants before the square X is one. So A is one. That's how it is. How come? Hey. Why is your name Sung Deok-sun? Haven't you given up on math yet? Just give up. I want to try as much as I can. I'm sorry, but can you explain it one more time? -Memorize it. -Okay. When AX squared plus BX plus C equals 0, X equals -B plus and minus radical B squared minus 4AC over 2A. -Memorize it. -Okay. I'm leaving! HANKOOK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL Excuse me! Yes. Please treat him. He's in too much pain. -Mr. Kim Seong-gyun? -Yes. Hold on. There were car accidents in front of Gwangsan Supermarket. We keep getting emergency patients. I'm sorry! Just a moment! Mi-ran, I seriously feel like I'm going to die. Don't move. Don't move. -Is he okay? -Hello! Is he hurt badly? I think he broke his back. -Really? -He got an X-ray and a CT scan. But there's too much going on here. There was an accident or something in front of Gwangsan Supermarket. Should I transfer him to a different hospital or what? My, why did a car accident have to happen now? Mr. Choi. I'm sure it's a mess over there. Honey, I'm home. Did he get a CT scan? Yes, he got an X-ray and a CT scan, but the doctors here are so busy right now. He has to get surgery soon. You said Hankook University Hospital? We'll go now, too. Just wait a bit. No, it's okay. It's so busy, there's nowhere for you to even stand. It'd be best if you came just as he's coming out of surgery. I'll monitor the situation and call you again. I understand. I'll wait for your call. Give us a call as soon as the surgery is set up. Okay! Did someone get hurt? Mr. Kim hurt his back. Oh! What are you doing? Get dressed! We have to go! No. He said it's too busy over there. We can go later when he calls back. How come it's never quiet in this neighborhood? So, how exactly did he get hurt? He fell down some stairs while exercising. He's never worked out before. Why did he exercise suddenly and get hurt? -Can you wash this? -Yes. Are you hungry? I boiled some sweet potatoes. Want some? Hey! Why are you throwing away a perfectly good shirt? Throw it out. You've worn it long enough! Here's a new one for you. Chief Lee. It's almost 11:00 p.m. It took so long! Those bastards. All right, good work today. There's a delicious place nearby. I'll buy. Let's go. It's over between me and Choi Taek. Excuse me. Where are the doctors? Please take care of him quickly! Sorry. All of the doctors are doing emergency operations. Please wait just a bit longer. He's in an emergency, too! Oh, my! Oh, my God! His injury is nothing compared to that person's... -Who's Mr. Kim Seong-gyun? -What brings you here so late, Professor? Who's Mr. Kim Seong-gyun? I am. Over here! We are here. Give me Mr. Kim's chart. Deputy Chief! What brings you here? I'll perform surgery now. Please prepare. No, sir. We'll-- What do you mean, no? He said he'll do it. Don't worry about this patient and focus on your own work. Many patients are waiting. -Hurry. -Yes, sir. Don't worry too much. We'll operate on him soon. Based on his chart, he did break his back. But it didn't crack. It just sank. So the operation won't take long. -Thank you. -Bye, then. Thank you. Excuse me... who is that man who appeared out of nowhere like a comet? He's the Deputy Chief. He's too senior to be in the ER. Bye, then. So, why were you in such a rush to leave this morning? Bo-ra hid that under the table to give to you. Mom. Yeah? What is it? This is for Dad. Oh, what is it? A present for him. You give it to him. Why? You give it to him. What does it matter who gives it to him? Give it to him, Mom. Thinking about it, you two really have similar personalities. Maybe that's why you two aren't close. Stop it with that nonsense, already! I am close with Bo-ra! Stop it! I'm home. Why were you out so late on a Saturday? Aren't you done with your part-time job? Yeah. My upperclassman bought us dinner. I'm going to bed. Bo-ra. Um... about this... Thanks. I'll enjoy wearing it. Okay. Is Dad okay? Yeah, he's okay. He's in surgery. They said he'll be fine. Don't worry. Have a seat. Mr. Kim Seong-gyun's guardian? Yes. Here. Yes. We just need a few more personal details about him here. -Here? -Yes. How did we get the Deputy Chief himself to perform surgery on him? The Chief of the hospital himself called him and asked a favor. The Chief of our hospital is a huge fan of Go-game and of Choi Taek. Choi Taek himself called the Chief. Choi Taek asked him to take good care of his relative. Oh, my. Oh, dear. Is he badly injured? Yeah. I think he broke his back. Oh, boy. I'll call him right away. Find his home phone number for me. Okay. Okay. By the way... you should say player for Go-game experts. Oh, I see. I don't know much about Go-game. Bye, then. Mr. Choi. When did you call Taek? I'm sure he's busy. A while ago. Oh, my. Thank you. Well, Master Choi. Uh... Oh, yeah. Here you go. What is it? Everyone worked so hard today, so please buy some drinks for everyone. What? I'm still a minor, so... please buy some drinks for the press team. Then, I'll be heading home now. Why his back, of all places? Jung-hwan. Go home and study. There's no place to sleep. -It's fine. -It's not. It's a simple surgery. No need for the whole family to sleep here. It's an inconvenience to your dad, but he can eat and is clear in his head. So go home. Okay? That makes me feel better, too. Hurry up! Okay. Jung-hwan. What are you doing? You're just getting home? Yeah. Is your dad okay? Yeah. The surgery went well. That's a relief. Did you get any sleep? No, but I can get some sleep tonight. Okay. Taek. Yeah? Thanks... for today. No need for that. Hey. Your shoelace is untied. Thanks. No need for that. Oh, my, this is great! Deok-sun, you don't need a tutor. You can just get tutored by watching this show on KBS 3! That's great! Here are some seasoned blood clams! Oh, my God! Did you dig up all the blood clams in Beolgyo? Or did blood clams ever wrong you? They were cheap yesterday, so I bought a lot. Why? You don't like it? What do you mean? I'm ecstatic! Stacking them must've been hard. Oh, yeah. Deok-sun. No-eul. There're stuffed blood clams and soup in the kitchen. Go bring some upstairs. The kids don't have a lot to eat for breakfast. Okay? Hey! Where are you going so early? Are you crazy? Why are you riding that dangerous thing? Just for an hour. I'm riding behind Michol. Since I'm riding behind him, people think I'm his girlfriend from afar. -Don't worry. -Be quiet! What if your mom hears? She's not here! What? They went to her company's athletic meet. I had breakfast alone today! You'll get beaten to death if you're caught. Your mom is totally scary. Chief Jo is busy. Hey. See you at Taek's later. I can beat Taek in Monopoly. See you later! Hey. Bo-ra, did you decide where you'll be studying? It's probably best to study close to your school, right? I haven't decided yet. I can't study at home, though. Oh, of course. Just find a place where you're the most comfortable. I'll go and-- I can eat it myself. You eat, Dad. Just let me know... Hi, Jin-ju! Look at me. Let me get rid of this. And your hair is a mess. Mom, I'm hungry! Oh, you're hungry, my son? Where's the cucumber kimchi? You made some yesterday. Oh, yeah. Just a minute! Wow, Mom, this is amazing! -Is it good? -Yeah. I know how to make good cucumber kimchi. Mr. Choi! Hey! Mr. Choi! Moo-sung! Yes, what is it? Come over. What? Have some cucumber kimchi. Oh, okay! I'll be right there! Is Taek home? Bring him, too. He's asleep. I'll be right over. MONOPOLY AIRPLANE TICKET Don't you memorize those. Just play casually. Okay. Sun-woo? Yes? Do you think Deok-sun will believe me if I confess my feelings for her? What if she doesn't believe me? How could she not believe you with those eyes? What? You only ever look at her among us. Also, the way you look at her is different compared to how you look at us. Isn't that obvious? How could it be the same? Deok-sun is a bit dull. But your actions and words clearly show your feelings. They say, if you want to know if someone likes you, look into their eyes. Eyes can't lie. You, in particular, are easy to read. How do you play Go-game with those eyes? They're so transparent. Master Choi's home. This is Sun-woo. What? -Really? -Yeah, he's at the police station now. He was riding the motorcycle with Michol without a helmet and he fell. He's not too badly hurt. This bastard! I'm going now. Crazy bastard. Hey, Dong-ryong. Are you okay? You're not hurt? Kim Joon-ki. Are you okay? I'm fine for now, but I won't be okay, soon. What do you mean? He called Chief Jo in the middle of her company athletic meet, so she'll be here soon. She's really scary when she's mad. She still doesn't talk to one of my brothers. I wish the dean was coming instead, damn it. Excuse me. Damn it! You're Ryu Dong-ryong's parent? Yes, I'm his dad. Thank you for your hard work. You okay, Joon-ki? Yes. They're still minors, so they'll get off with a warning. It could have been worse. They were riding right next to a car without a helmet, and slipped-- I see. I'll be sure to check on him from now on. I'm sorry. -Do I just need to sign here? -Yes. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yes. If you're not hurt, it's all good. It's okay. It's okay. If you're not hurt, it's all good. Eat up. Yes. No more motorcycles, got it? I'll only let you off the hook once. Not twice. Okay. I'm working late tonight. Hey, Dong-ryong. Quit messing around. Yes! What are you laughing about? Isn't it time to go to your English school? I'm off! Eat, okay? I don't want to eat by myself... Hurry up and eat. I'll go after you've finished. Mom. We don't have to call Deok-sun Soo-yeon anymore. So I'm going to call her Deok Soo from now on. Deok Soo-yeon! And Jung-bong is seeing someone. But Mrs. Cheetah can't find out about it. Rules are rules! One time, Dad came in through the front door and told us to be quiet. Then he came through the back door and did it again! I didn't know that my youngest son was such a chatterbox. I think that Bo-ra will die a spinster. My neighborhood friends greeted No-eul, thinking that he was older. Mom, the seaweed soup is so delicious. Eat all you can. Hey! Get away! You little rascal! I'm going to tell my mom! My mom is the Queen of Insurance at Daehan for seven years! Tell her. Go ahead! You hate your mom! What's this? When did I ever say that? I said that she was busy! You made up with your mom? No way, Kim Jung-ryeol. I've never fought with her. I like my mom! Not true! Guys. My mom works. She's on a different level than your moms. Jeez, what would you know about anything? Deok-sun, what would you know? -Wow. -I don't know anything. He needs to be beaten. Come here! -Jeez, damn it. -Jeez! This is bad. Did you teach him? I told you to teach him loose. Jeez. He read the instructions himself. We can't win him. He's a crazy bastard. How come the Space Adventure card is missing? What? There's one right here. There was supposed to be two. We've gone through the whole deck, but there's only one. You're right. Where did the other one go? SPACE ADVENTURE Here's the Vienna Coffee you ordered. Enjoy. Yes, thank you. Go ahead. Your hands will get messy. All right, here we go. Why am I always the one making ramen? I'll make it next time. -No! -No! Hey, Dong-ryong. It's Nami. Deok-sun, where are you? Don't you hear the music? Shouldn't you dance with me? Quit it. Do it by yourself. I was at the police station today. Can't you dance together for your friend? I'm worn out. You are so good. You're so good! Aren't you tired? Why did you come so early? I just got here, too. What do you want to drink? So, this is Vienna Coffee? It only has whipped cream on top. Wow, it's good. Bo-ra, you have something to say, right? Spit it out. I'm dying of curiosity. Here, a gift for you. Why a gift? I got my paycheck from my job. I haven't been working long, so I didn't get paid much. I'll buy you something better when I earn more money. Wow. I'll wear it the next time we go out. Bo-ra, isn't your part-time job difficult? I quit. What? When? Last week. I don't work there anymore. Why am I happy about that? Does that mean we can see each other more often now? Sun-woo. I'm going to study for the bar exam. Actually, I made my decision. That doesn't mean... we're breaking up, does it? Why would you say that? Why did I do that? Yes, turn like that! {\an8}Don't talk if you don't know. {\an8}Why are you being such amateurs? {\an8}I have one wish. {\an8}It's my wish! {\an8}I'll beat your mom. {\an8}She is Ra Mi-ran. {\an8}Are you kidding? I'm Park Nam-jeong of Ssangmun. {\an8}Mr. Choi, {\an8}listen to me. Okay? {\an8}Sun-young. {\an8}Yes? What is it? {\an8}Nothing. Never mind. {\an8}I wish I had a good friend by my side, like the ones that you have. {\an8}He'll confess to her after the movie. Finally. {\an8}Choi Taek, 6-dan, is finally making his move! {\an8}Keep Saturday open. {\an8}I'll call you after my match. {\an8}His competitive nature. {\an8}He's incredibly competitive. {\an8}We have two fiercely competitive people. {\an8}Subtitle translation by Stefanie Elalouf
