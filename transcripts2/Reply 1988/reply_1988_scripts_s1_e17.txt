 {\an8}I bet he's meeting with someone important. {\an8}Well, I'm nobody to him. {\an8}Darn it. {\an8}Am I really nobody to him? Yeah, I kind of am nothing. I guess I'm not that important. I thought you were going to the movies today. Why didn't you go? YOGURT What's up with him? -Right? -Is he playing around with you? I think I get it. What? Choi Taek, that Go-game kid...

 -He must think of you as a soft touch. -What? You're such a soft touch to him! Hey, what about Maggie? She's grounded. I managed to talk to her. She's not allowed to leave her house. That's too bad. She has to go on dates. Dates? Forget it. It's all over. You didn't forget about tomorrow, right? Pizza in Apgujeong with Sae-mi. Of course. How could I forget? It's been a while. Ouch! Ow... Moo-sung, she's heavy. Let me hold her. No, I'm fine. She's not heavy at all. Let's go. I don't want you to work at that job anymore. I've been so bored lately. What happened to your hand? I burned myself. It's fine. It doesn't look fine. You should've put some ointment on it. It'll heal. I haven't seen the motorcycle recently. I guess he moved. No, he didn't. He drives by every once in a while. Be careful. See you tomorrow at the Hanyang Shopping Center. Okay. Bye. Hurrah, pizza! Hey, are you okay? Are you hurt? No. Wow, Deok-sun. You were as fast as an athlete. You even protected your bag. Impressive! Oh, my God! -Are you okay? -No! Can you move? -No, I can't. -What do we do? Oh, how refreshing! You're working hard. Here, I'll take it. Come over here. You're very diligent. All right. See you! It smells so bad. Ew! Why is it flushing so weakly? My back hurts! My back hurts so much. {\an8}FOLK REMEDIES FOR PILES AND CONSTIPATION Choi Taek, who won the Ying Shibei World Professional Go Championship, arrived back in Korea this Sunday morning at Gimpo airport. By beating Ying Shibei, he has won every major world tournament, including Fujitsu and the Woori Securities Cup. He has become the best Go player in the world. Taek must be back home. Hey, hey... be careful. Hey, ouch! Darn it! Deok-sun, I'll buy you a pizza next time. Or you can ask Taek to buy one for you. Why did it happen on the weekend? Why not tomorrow or the day after! I am only going to wear it for a few days. I have no school tomorrow. It's the school anniversary. Why couldn't I have gotten hurt tomorrow? Why on my days off? I hate it. When are you going to grow up? Hey, Deok-sun! Are you alive or dead? Alive! You are alive. Okay then, I'm leaving. Where? We're playing soccer. Taek is joining us too. -Give me a piggyback ride. -Huh? Come on! Let me tag along. I want to go. How can I? I can't carry someone bigger than me. That's absurd. Hey, Bo-ra. You should eat something, okay? Bro! I finally finished-- a thousand paper cranes. Where did my little brother go? JOIN THE AIR FORCE ACADEMY YUGONG TRAINING INSTITUTE No one's here. Hurry. We'll get caught if we keep this up. That's not gonna happen. We've never been caught. Where's Taek? I'm here. It's still cold. Get some exercise, Taek. It's just because of the jet lag. Don't be ridiculous. Here, warm up. I'm going to the bathroom. Wake up already, dude! YUGONG TRAINING INSTITUTE You tied your shoelaces well. What a surprise. You tied them before and I just left them. I won't be able to re-do them if I untie them. So I tied it once again real tight. Did you check my wallet by any chance? No. I didn't look inside. Hey, watch out! Get off! -No, I don't want to. -Get off! I won't! -Get off now! -Hey, you're going to kill him. Just let go of him already. Come on! He kept saying that I'm heavy in public. I wasn't lying. You brute! Dude, cut it out! It'll get dark soon. Two on two? I'll be with Taek. Jung-hwan, you go with Dong-ryong. I'm doing you a favor because he's no help at all. Are you kidding me? I'm pretty good. That would be like Deok-sun getting into Seoul University. How crazy. How long has it been since you saw the sun? Jung-hwan, we'll give these guys a good thrashing. Get up! Let's go! Okay. Wow! Sun-woo! Wow! Oh dear... Are you okay? It's killing me! My butt hurts! Stop making a fuss. How bad is it? I think I'm going to die. Rest over there. Alright. You know what? My butt hurts so bad right now. Seriously, I'm not kidding. -I don't know what's happening. -Dong-ryong! What? Hey, are you menstruating? What... me? Hey! Get him on my back. -I'm taking him to the hospital. -Okay. Taek, let his family know. His dad is home today. -Hurry. -All right. My goodness. Hey, you should go on your own. Get going. Hurry up. Get on my back. What are you doing? Get on. Come on! What are you doing here? Stay right there! What are you waiting for? Get on! Well... Hey! What are you doing? Put me down! Hey! Come on! Let me go. Hey! My gosh. LOUNGE Bo-ra, congratulations though. Your dream came true. I know you haven't passed the test yet. You've been dying to get into law school since the beginning of first year. Congratulations! ARIRANG MATCH Honey! Mi-ran! I'm hungry! Did you hurt something else? Why are you smiling? You're happy you hurt your back? Goodness, is this the year of three disasters? Nothing seems to work out. You hurt your back. And the singing contest didn't go well. Here. Do you like me that much? Yes. You know how they say life is full of blessings in disguise. That is so true. My back is broken, but... if it weren't for that, you would never treat me this good. It feels like our newlywed days. Also, I'm glad about what happened with the singing contest. The preliminaries were just right. If you had gone on, I would have starved to death by now. Besides, it's the best contest in the nation, with a great reputation, history, and tradition. Not everyone can make it, you know. I know you're talented, but they have their standards to meet. What did I just say? I was not myself. I was momentarily insane. Mi-ran... I've got to take a dump. Honey, I'm so sorry. I love you! Mi-ran! I... Take me to the toilet first! Sun-woo, set the table. Okay, Mom. Give me a sec! Oh dear! Hold on, Jin-ju. Let me put this on him first. It's okay. You should've disinfected it before putting on a bandage, Sir. Sun-woo, call Taek over. I made beef stew. Oh, I'll tell him to come over. Hello. Hi, Jin-ju. How did you know when to come? -I smelled the food. -What are you? A dog? Earlier, your mom told me to come by for dinner. By the way, is Dong-ryong okay? Why does a young student have piles? Yes, Taek and I visited him earlier, and he was doing fine. Who told him to put a garlic in there? Unbelievable. He put a garlic in there? Why? It's a folk remedy. He knew he had piles, but was too embarrassed to tell anyone. So he tried to fix it with garlic. He doesn't want anyone to visit. He's too embarrassed. He brought more embarrassment upon himself. And he's so immature. He wanted bananas and pestered Taek to buy him some. When will he grow up? That punk! I'm sorry, Sir. It's okay. Hey, it's more helpful if you do nothing. Huh? Just do nothing. None of them even match. Go play with Jin-ju. Son, that girl-- You said that girl is the same age as Deok-sun, right? -Yeah. -Seriously, she is really pretty. Her parents must've lived selflessly in their past lives to have such a pretty daughter. Goodness. By the way, what's Deok-sun doing? She can't go anywhere because of her broken toe. Is she in her room doing-- No way. By any chance, is she studying-- That's not possible. Is she studying? She's sleeping. Ah. She needs her beauty sleep. She's sleeping right now. You've slept a lot, yet... Hey! What are you doing? Put me down! Taek. Never mind. Sun-woo. One day... I came home early from Go club. I saw my dad eating cold rice with water all by himself. He hadn't expected me to be home that early. Dad was so flustered and embarrassed. Do you know what I thought? Seeing him so flustered... and embarrassed that he didn't know what to do with himself... When I saw him standing there like that... I thought that it would be nice if he had someone by his side. I'm happy that it's your mom. I'm relieved. You're okay with it? Don't you miss your mom? It's been longer for me than it has for you. I guess that's why it's easier for me. I must be younger than you. You didn't know? Ah... my pride is hurt. Hey, you know my birthday is before yours. I'm your older brother. Crazy bastard. I'm mentally more mature than you. What the heck? I don't think so. Wow, really? Wow, you've learned a lot of bad things lately. "Making a wish on a falling star will make it come true." I'm sure you've all heard that before. From midnight til dawn tomorrow, there will be a space show of hundreds of shooting stars an hour. Following the meteor shower of 1981, this will be the largest number seen ever. You should be looking northeast around the constellation Perseus... Mi-ran, should we go outside to look at the stars? I don't want to. Okay. East, west, south, north. East, three times! EAST, WEST, SOUTH, NORTH You're a princess, Sir! CHOI TAEK, 6TH DAN, BEAT CHANG HAO, 9TH DAN Wow, he made a headline in the newspaper. Should we throw a party or something? He won quite a big competition. There's no need. Taek will find it a burden. There are times when he wins and loses. If I'm too happy when he wins, he might feel burdened. I try to stay the same whether he wins or loses. That makes sense. But still, keep this newspaper. Taek looks so good in the photo. No, it's fine. I guess Taek has won so many times, now his articles are nothing to you. -Is that right? -That's right. -It's no big deal. -Gosh. South, five times. Why do you want to look at shooting stars? Jung-hwan, do you know about shooting stars? Should I? Make a wish while looking at a shooting star. Your wish will come true. Dad. Yes? Oh! You can turn up the volume. I'm resting today. It's fine. I'm going to sleep anyway. Okay. By the way, Taek... Don't take sleeping pills tonight. Okay, I won't. Do you want some hot milk? I'll make some later if I can't sleep. -Go to bed. Good night. -Okay. Hello. Bo-ra, what's up? It's pretty late. Right now? You're here? Okay, I'm heading out now. You have to melt it. Your love will come true if you do so. What? You have to melt the chocolate before you eat it. And then you will get your love. That is for candy. Wow, there is nothing that you don't know, right? -Do I have to watch the stars? -Yes. -You kept these things? -Of course. You know me. I'll give it to Jung-bong and Jung-hwan as gifts when they get married. Look how neat Jung-hwan's handwriting is. He was always a smart kid, wasn't he? Bo-ra, what's going on? -Sun-woo... -Bo-ra, wait. There's a shooting star. They should be falling by now. Oh, oh... Jung-hwan! Wow! Oh, it's really happening. Wow, we saw it. Did you make a wish? No, I forgot. I did. What? To have a good relationship with Maggie? No. For my little brother... to be able to do what he really wants to do. I played soccer today. Taek and Deok-sun scored one goal, and Sun-woo and Dong-ryong scored zero. I scored two goals, because my big brother cheered for me and shouted out my name. My brother's dream is to be Maradona. I made a promise to him. I will become Maradona for him. I will work harder at soccer from now on. Wow, those pilots are so cool. I could never be one. Jung-hwan, you know... I don't want you to go to the Air Force Academy because of me. My little brother... I want you to do what you want. That is my wish. It's not because of you. That's where I really want to go. I mean it! Do you think I'm stupid and can't tell the difference? -Hmm... -Hmm? What do you mean by that? Seriously! Why are you being like this? I really mean it. Seriously! -Is that so? -Trust me. Just trust me, okay? Bo-ra, did you make a wish? Did you? I did. What was it? For you to stop smoking. Did you make a wish? Yeah, I made one too. What was it? For us to break up. Sun-woo, let's break up. I'm sorry. Bo-ra, if you take one more step from there... I will never see you again. Argh! Seriously! Did you see it? Did you make a wish? No, not yet. All right. Jung-hwan, I hope you make a wish, okay? My wish... My wish is... I wish that he... is a real big jerk. {\an8}SSANGMUN PHARMACY Hello, Sir! Hi there. How's your toe, Deok-sun? Oh, it's fine. You didn't sleep at the hospital last night? No, his mom is there right next to him. Dads are pretty useless in times like these. Where are you off to? No bus is running yet. Oh... isn't it the school anniversary today? Is it a school day? No, you're right. It is the school anniversary today. Oh, I was so scared. Where are you off to then? It's a secret. Huh? Choi Taek 9th dan, Ying Shibei... Talking nonsense... Mr. Ryu... hemorrhoids... garlic... That crazy idiot! My goodness! -Oh, hello there. Good morning. -Hello. I don't know if your sister is having breakfast. Don't you worry, Mom. She can take care of herself just fine. She has money and her own room. There's nothing to worry about. Worry about me instead. I don't worry about you at all. You have such a good personality. You'll do very well once you start your career. I won't worry about you at all, no matter where you are. You really think so? Seriously? Seriously! Deok-sun, is there anything you want to do? What do you want to become? I have something, Mom. What is it? A singer. I'm going to be a singer. No way! Do something else. A singer? You should know your place. You got noticed once in a contest and now you've got a silly idea. -I'm going to do it. -You can't! You got it? Gosh, a singer... Hello? What? Okay. Jung-bong! I'm afraid Maggie can't make it today. She just called me. I'm so sorry. She can't even step out of her house. You can't wait in front of her house. Her dad's watching. Sorry, Jung-bong. I'll make sure to give it to her. I'll be at Bo-ra's place. Just stay lying down, would you? Why do you keep moving around? It's boring and stuffy here. Then call Mr. Choi or Mr. Ryu over for a chat. Can I? Where are Jung-bong and Jung-hwan? Both are studying, I guess. -I'm visiting Dong-ryong at the hospital. -No one's with him? No, he needs something from me. -I'm leaving now. -Okay, don't be late. Take a taxi if it gets too late. To Maggie, First of all, Happy Birthday. More than anyone else in the world, I want to wish you the happiest birthday. Maggie, by any chance, if you are feeling bad that you could not make it to our date today, please do not feel that way. FOR MANY YEARS TO COME, WE WILL BE TOGETHER... -Oh, come in. -What is that? I bought some blue crabs. Sun-woo likes blue crabs a lot. I'll put it here. You didn't have to bring ours. You have your own big family. I got a good price at the market. What are you eating? Wow, I didn't know No-eul is talented in that way. We may have a big star coming out of this neighborhood. Don't even get started on that. Ever since the contest, No-eul wants to become a singer. Then let him be one. What's wrong with that? Oh no, he can't! Never. He won't be able to make a living. And not everyone can be a singer. I wanted to be a singer when I was young. -What? -Really? Is that so surprising? I mean, as a kid. I'm not talking about now. Well, when I was young... my dream was to become a film star. I was a big fan of Choi Moo-ryong. I wanted to be a movie star and have one meal with him. How about you? What was your dream? Me? For me... a painter. -What? -Huh? That was when I was young. You can dream anything as a kid. That's why you like to play Go-Stop so much. You like to match the pictures and all. This year, there was a survey of primary school students  and their dream jobs. First place was a scientist, and second was a professor. An athlete and a doctor followed. The results are quite different from the 70's. A government employee and a soldier were on top back then. The change in children's dreams is likely influenced by their parents' expectations and the mass media. I wanted to be a scientist as a kid. Then I guess you've achieved your dream. You are the owner of an electronics store. -Oh, that makes sense. -That's right. In my opinion, MacGyver is a great scientist. Better than Einstein! And what was your dream? You have such a light hand. You could have been an excellent technician. -A wrestler. -What? Huh? I wanted to be a wrestler. If I had continued... All the trophies Lee Man-gi won would be mine. He is a very lucky person. I think you're the lucky one. Your back could have been broken. You're such a big talker, you know. No, I was quite an athlete for real. I ended up running a clock shop though. What about you, Mr. Ryu? Me? Mine was... a dancer. I was crazy about dancing before my military service. I would go clubbing most nights. -Should I show you all? -No. I don't know if I've still got it. Come on everybody! Clap your hands! Oh, looking good! Now I see where Dong-ryong got his love of playing and dancing from. He's just the same as his dad. But then again, how could he hide it away and choose to be a teacher? Your foot is hurt, so why are you out here? It's okay. I can walk. Why did you go to the Go club? The contest is over. Will you get a thorn in your butt if you skip a day? Hey. It's a tongue, not a butt, isn't it? You should get inside. Okay. You too. Come in. -You didn't go home? -I didn't. {\an8}INTERNAL MEDICINE SLEEPING PILLS You should stop taking sleeping pills. Okay. I'll take less from now on. Deok-sun, I'm going to sleep now. All right. You should get going. Bye. Sun-woo! Eat breakfast! Deok-sun! No-eul! Breakfast is ready! Jung-bong! Jung-hwan! Eat breakfast! Here you are. Let me put it in the middle. Make some room, please. Make some room, everyone. Let's eat, everybody. Eat a lot, my sons. Thank you for the food. Wow, honey. This is unbelievable. It's so delicious. You're better than the famous chefs. Son, is it good? Yes. What about you, my firstborn? How is the bulgogi? Yes, it is very good. I'm telling you it's really good. This is so good. It's absolutely delicious. Unbelievable! Mmm! How can bulgogi taste like this? I can taste it from the tip of my tongue. I feel a shudder. Even my back feels better now. It's like the taste of 100-year-old soy sauce. Wow, it's so good. Here you go. Wow, it looks good. Hi, Jin-ju. Oh dear. Sun-woo, put out your laundry if you have any. And I'll clean your room today. No, Mom. My laundry is already in the washer and my room is clean. I cleaned it yesterday. Let's have some soup, Jin-ju. Here. Mom, how can we eat all of this? Why can't we? We can do it! Wait until the elders start their meal. Elders first. -Enjoy. -Okay. Taek! Taek! -Let's eat breakfast. -Okay. Let's eat breakfast. I'll be right out. -See you. -Okay. See you! Open your eyes. Okay. Bye. Why are you here? I'm trying to wake up. All right. Wait, Deok-sun. When did you leave last night? I left right after you said you were going to sleep. Why? What? Did you have a dream? I did. That's a relief. Why's that? Was I in your dream? What kind of dream did you have? No, it was nothing. You don't need to worry. Oh my. What about Dong-ryong? Dong-ryong? I envy him the most. He's probably at the hospital doing nothing. Dad! Oh! Deok-sun! Oh! My dear daughter! You were waiting for me until now? Your foot isn't better yet. What is it? You missed me? This is the beauty of having a daughter. Yeah... sure. Dad, buy me an ice cream. What the heck? You were waiting for ice cream, not me. Come on! I was waiting for both. -Please! -Where are we going? Let's go eat ice cream. I waited for both. Deok-sun, you've been studying hard lately. It must be tough. Dad, even if I don't get into college, you can't mistreat me. Come on. As if you would accept mistreatment. You can't lose confidence in yourself over something like that. Actually, this time I would. Deok-sun, who cares if you don't go to college? You can do something else. -You're lying. -Am I? Yeah, you got me. You know what? You have exactly one year. Consider yourself dead for a year. And do your best. Giving up without even trying just won't do. Be prepared to go through anything and do your best. And if it still doesn't work out, then there's nothing you can do. Dad, I'm going to do my best. But still, if I don't get into college... I don't want you to hate me, okay? All right, my dear. Don't you worry. You said you'll study hard. I'm so grateful that you made up your mind. By the way... what is your dream, Deok-sun? What kind of person do you want to be? Dad will support you even more than Bo-ra. So tell me. Don't worry about anything. All my debts are settled. I'm saving lots of money now. What is it? Is it a secret? I don't have one. I don't have a dream, Dad. I know, I'm pathetic. I feel stupid. No way! You're not stupid. You can find your dream, then. -Are you sure? -Of course. When I was your age, I didn't think about anything either. Deok-sun, everyone is the same. It's okay. It's not just you. Don't you worry. It wasn't my dream to work at a bank. It wasn't. I just... I just needed to make a living, so I worked away. Somehow I ended up here. Then what's your dream now, Dad? I want to know your hopes and dreams. My hopes and dreams? I want Bo-ra, you, and No-eul to never be in pain. And to be healthy. That's the only dream that I have. No, not a dream for me but for you. What is yours? That's... that's your dad's dream. Having all three of my kids being healthy and not sick. What more can I ask for than that? Nothing. That's all I want. That's not fair. What's wrong with you? Why are you crying? Now I see where Dong-ryong's love for playing and dancing comes from. He's just like his dad. But then again, how could he hide it away and choose to be a teacher? My body cannot handle it. Don't be shy like that. You should record your own album. It's all in the past. When it comes to dancing, I don't even regret it this much. -You sure? -Sure, not even a bit. I'm just concerned about my youngest who takes after me. He doesn't study and goes around dancing. That's what worries me the most. Gosh, Dong-ryong... that kid. He needs to grow up. I passed down something like that to him. What kind of father am I? Look how great it is. Same here. I wish Taek wouldn't take after me. That is my dream. What do you mean by that? He's all grown up and mature, just like you. You don't need to worry about Taek at all. I want him to take after my good traits only. I want Taek to be like other kids. I want him to complain, act irritated, and get angry. Just like other kids... I wish he would open up his heart more often. He started Go-game as a kid and was surrounded by adults. He developed a habit of holding in his anger. He wasn't that introverted in the beginning. There's nothing else I want. I just want him to live like other kids his age. And to stop taking sleeping pills. At least for one day, I'd like for him to sleep peacefully. That is my dream. I feel the same. I want Jung-bong to be as he is now, and not get sick. I want him to be healthy. I don't want anything else for him. We're all worried about the kids. Darn it. That's why you like to play Go-Stop so much. You like to match the pictures and all. Gosh, that's all in my past though. My wish now is for Jung-bong to get into college. That is my dream. Same here. Also... I will have nothing to ask for if Bo-ra's personality softened up. I want to put her in a mixer with Deok-sun and mix their personalities. I want it for Sun-woo too. He's just like his dad and sticks to his principles all the time. That's not going to help him once he starts his career. It can be so tiring from time to time. Oh no, don't worry about it. I have nothing to wish for, but... Jung-hwan has such a cold personality. It's a problem. He only takes after his dad's bloody nose, not his personality. -Geez. -Whew. If you ask me what my wishes are, I don't have many. I just want Jin-ju and Sun-woo to not feel self-conscious around people. That is my only wish. The kids are high school seniors now. I can't stop worrying about her. Should I feed her herbal medicine? Apparently, they are the baby boomers born in the year of the pig. What happened in 1971? Everyone gave birth to a baby. I should feed Jung-hwan well. What should I feed him? Where are you off to then? It's a secret. Huh? I'm going out for bananas. My youngest asked for bananas, so I'm going to go buy some. I see. But I don't think anyone is open yet. There must be a place open already. See you! -Good bye. -Bye. Thank you. I need to go to Yeongdeungpo fruit market. Sure. -Oh, hello there. Good morning. -Hello. CHOI TAEK, 6TH DAN, BEAT CHANG HAO, 9TH DAN {\an8}1986, THE YEAR OF CHOI TAEK CHOI TAEK 6TH DAN WON THE FUJITSU CUP! SUNG DEOK-SUN MY DAD'S DREAM = ME Why am I the only one without a dream? I was feeling troubled about it. Now I feel much better after having talked to Dad about it. However, I still envy people who have dreams. I envy Ja-hyun, who wants to be a hairdresser. It may sound silly, but I also envy No-eul who wants to be a singer. How did they figure out what they want to be? And how come I don't have anything that I want to do? I feel pathetic tonight. Deok-sun, take this food to your sister! HYOSEUNG STUDY ROOM Is studying for the bar exam already an achievement? Get that look off your face. Is this it? Room 108? What? What's with you? Bo-ra, you sleep in a place like this? What's the matter with you? Did you have any ramen? Don't you have any money? You should eat rice as a meal! I have money. I just don't have time. Hey. Bo-ra... -This is stupid of you. -What is this... Seriously, what's wrong with you? I'm so embarrassed now. Saturday, April 8, 1989. It was the most shameful day of my life. I cried in Bo-ra's arms. Why did I do that? Regret is washing over me. -Here you go. -Wow. So good! It's full of meat inside. -Is that so? -Yeah. That's because I cooked it well. Eat a lot. There's nothing to throw away. Look how small they are. Yum! So yummy. The 17th letter. It is a beautiful season when the flower buds burst open from everywhere and everything comes back to life. Maggie, you remind me of a spring day. How are you doing? I'm doing just fine. I wonder if you're doing well as I have not heard from you. I don't want to burden you. I know the timing is not ideal for you as it is your senior year. If time allows, please let me know how you're doing. I'll wait to hear from you if you don't mind. From your JB in Ssangmun. FROM JUNG-BONG TO MI-OK FROM JUNG-BONG TO MI-OK Jung-bong. TO MI-OK Please forget about me. That is my wish. INVITATION TO SPACE TRAVEL Maggie received 35 letters before writing him back. That was the last letter between them. Maggie left to study in the US before the summer came. And... she fell out of touch with me as well. Saturday, July 15, 1989. Summer vacation had begun. Jung-bong left for a temple. And... For the first time in my life, I got a nosebleed. I am in my senior year, after all. {\an8}November 1, 1989. {\an8}The Haitai Tigers won the professional baseball league again this year, as expected. Ah, there was a small incident though. The Pacific Dolphins had advanced to the playoffs. {\an8}DO NOT SLEEP STUDY ROOM December 5, 1989. It snowed for the first time that year. Moo-sung, it's snowing. Look, it's the first snow of the year. Yes, I know. I saw it. Have this. Sun-young, by the way... Yeah? Since it's cold... should we... live together? December 8, 1989. We only have a week left of this hellish senior year. Seven days. We only have seven days to go. Taek. While we were in our senior year... Taek broke three records. {\an8}The highest winning rate in a year, the longest winning streak, {\an8}and the largest number of matches. {\an8}This year, Taek had a whopping 111 matches. {\an8}1990 College Testing Assessment will be administered tomorrow {\an8}for 89 colleges nationwide, {\an8}which will be taken at 526 locations. {\an8}This year, the baby boomers who were born in 1971 will take the test. There are around 894,000 applicants, a record-high. It's the most competitive college entrance exam in history. One out of 4.57 applicants is expected to be accepted. The total enrollment quota remains the same as last year, which will make the competition even fiercer than any other year. {\an8}DECEMBER 15, 1989 How was the test? Don't ask. How was the test? Are you kidding me? I got accepted ages ago. -Oh, congrats. -Thanks. What about Jung-bong? Guess he did well. He had stayed at a temple to study. You did well, didn't you? -Yeah. -Geez, you're all so annoying. -Guys, any plans for next Saturday? -Why? I have some tickets for exhausted seniors. What is that? Campus Music Festival. -Ooh! -Taek is going too. What would you guys do without me? Seriously, all you know is the quadratic formula. You know nothing about the joy of life. Next Saturday! Hi. What are you guys doing? We're late! Hey! December 23, 1989. The weather looked like it was going to snow. We went to see the Campus Music Festival the day before Christmas Eve. It was the last day of our teens that we spent together. {\an8}DECEMBER 31ST HANIL BANK JANUARY, 1990 The year changed and the number looked unfamiliar. It became the year 1990. And we turned 20 years old. Jung-hwan went to the Air Force Academy in Cheongju. Gee... {\an8}ADMISSION FEE YONSEI UNIVERSITY {\an8}Sun-woo got into medical school with a full scholarship. Mom, why are you crying? Oh, my son. My son... My son. Thank you so much. And Jung-bong... He finally got into college after many attempts and failures. -Hooray! -Hooray! JUNG-BONG JOINED LAW SCHOOL AT SEONGGYUNGWAN UNIV. CIVIL LAW That's how everyone took one step toward their dreams. I started a new challenge toward my dream as well. Today's newspaper for sale! When flowers bloom in March, I enrolled in Hansaem College Prep Academy in Noryangjin. But I was not lonely. I have my soul mate, Dong-ryong, beside me. Next stop is Noryangjin. {\an8}DECEMBER 31, 1990 This year, Byun Jin-sub will win for sure. It's Hyun Cheol, kid. You know nothing. Just stop talking. It's starting now! Yay! It's him! It's Byun Jin-sub! A woman that looks good in jeans That's me! {\an8}DECEMBER 31, 1991 {\an8}My life is mine! {\an8}Min Hae-kyung! {\an8}-I don't think so. -Be quiet. I can't hear it. -Yay! -Yay! We are together And it didn't happen by accident {\an8}You don't know me {\an8}DECEMBER 30, 1992 {\an8}This time, it must be Kim Kook-hwan's "Ta-Ta-Ta"! {\an8}Wrong! {\an8}-This year, it's going to be... -Shin Seung-hun! Shin Seung-hun! Shin Seung-hun! {\an8}This year... {\an8}DECEMBER 27, 1993 {\an8}If I don't get it right... {\an8}I'll be your kid. Just you wait. -This year, it goes to... -Seo Taiji's "Hayeoga." How come I've never ever gotten it right? It's about time I would get it. It's about time... {\an8}OCTOBER 8, 1994 {\an8}-Honey! Hold it tight! -Honey! I got it! {\an8}Hold it steady! Oh my God! Honey! You're doing well. Honey! Aah! What's all this fuss about? Oh my! You're having so much fun! You guys are like lovebirds together. You went grocery shopping? Why don't you order some dishes? No way. The kids don't eat at home often. I should cook for them when I can. They're all coming, right? Yeah, Jung-hwan is coming as well because it's the weekend. Deok-sun will be here in the evening because of her work schedule. What about Dong-ryong? I heard he's busy working at his brother's restaurant. They are all coming. They always come for Taek's birthday. I suppose Taek is the busiest, though. Let's feed the kids first. Then we can play Go-Stop. I'm in. Get ready and wait for me. You can continue and get back to your date. This time, let's go straight to the empty lot over there. -Honey! -Wait! -Hold on! -Oh dear. Dad, it's 1,000 won! You said 100 won for each. It's 1,000 won. I see black hairs though. I pulled out more than ten. It's already at a discount. Jin-ju, Mommy is back! I could've gone with you. You should have called me. Honey, Jung-hwan and Deok-sun are coming today. Everyone will be here. Yay! So happy to see Taek after such a long time thanks to them. SHIN SUNG-WOO SHIN SEUNG-HUN My goodness... Do you like it that much? Why don't you hang it on the wall and look at it every day and night? We saved a lot. Soon, we'll be able to move out of this half-basement. That's right. We can't live in a half-basement with no sunlight forever. Now that we have two daughters who make money, it helped us a lot. They're better than me. If I had known that, I would've only had daughters. Daughters are the best. It's not that daughters are the best. It's that our daughters are the best. Oh, Deok-sun is coming today for sure, isn't she? Sure, it's Taek's birthday today. Bo-ra is coming later tonight since tomorrow is Sunday. Now that you brought it up, I'm glad my daughters are making money. But, they don't have meals with us every day anymore. I see their faces only on the weekends, and then they're gone. Sheesh. Then one day, they will get married. How will I live in an empty house? Yeah, you are right. Oh my, why are you crying over that now? I'm just bringing up the future. Don't cry so easily. It's not a distant future. Just you wait a bit. They will bring someone and say they are going to get married. Well, were you planning on living with them for thousands of years? Are you okay with that? I'm getting teary already. Just thinking about it... I'm afraid I would cry like this on their wedding days. Come on. Why would you cry? You'll see. On Deok-sun and Bo-ra's wedding days, I'll be so happy when I walk in holding their hands. I'll be dancing and smiling as I walk in. Will you, for real? I'll be watching you to see if you cry or not. You can watch me. If I cry at the wedding, I'll be your son. Where's your mom? Is she still on her bike? Wow, Mi-ran! You are really good at it now. You're on fire. Keep it going! That's it, great! Honey! Oh no, Honey! Are you all right? Honey! Mom, I'm home. Did you have dinner? -I did. -Okay. You can go home early today. You worked hard staying up all night. See you tomorrow. Thank you, sir. Sun-woo, we're going out. We're going to Space today. You'll be in the basement. Dream on! Hey, come on. I can't join anyway. It's my best friend's birthday. What? It's Choi Taek the 9th dan's birthday. I'm leaving. Dude! Tell him happy birthday... I'm leaving now. You're leaving so early today, Choi Taek the 9th dan! I have an appointment with my friends. I know. The juniors wanted to have a birthday party for you, but I told them you have important plans. Thank you, sir. You have a car, right? -Yes. -I can pull it out for you if you want. You don't have to go back and forth a hundred times. I parked in a wide spot this time. See you. He bought a car? You didn't know? He got it as a prize after winning the Toyota competition. But then, he actually drives? And the car moves? It does move. But he can't park. Mom, I'm home. -Jung-hwan! -My son! -Brother! -Jung-hwan! -My son! -Jung-hwan! -Jung-hwan! -My son! Mom, I'm home. Dad, your second daughter is here. Deok-sun! No-eul! How come you look so young? Get in already! Is there anything you want me to do? Study. {\an8}Oh! {\an8}Oh my... {\an8}-His nickname is Trash. -What? {\an8}KIM JAE-JUN {\an8}Thanks. I'll pay you back. {\an8}Don't be such a city slicker. No need to pay me back. {\an8}Hey! I'm popular too. {\an8}Don't get dumped this time. {\an8}I'm not getting dumped! {\an8}Why are you so bad at dating? {\an8}I tried hard. {\an8}Then try harder. {\an8}You're going to die without ever telling her how you feel. {\an8}Deok-sun, {\an8}I've wanted to tell you this for a long time... {\an8}Subtitle translation by: Alison Woods
