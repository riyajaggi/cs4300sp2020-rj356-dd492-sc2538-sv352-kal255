 I'll be at Taek's place. Don't be late. I might forget what you look like. The whole gang will be there. I'll be late. He hasn't seen them in forever. Here. Stay out late if you want. We can see you tomorrow, I suppose. I'm sorry. I'll get going now. Okay, go ahead. They're waiting. Hanging out with his friends is what he wants the most, huh? I guess he's all grown up now. I guess so. I liked it when he was in high school. Those were good times.

 I'm going out. I'm meeting the gang. I'll be late. All right, have fun. -Have fun. -See you. What is it? Why are you standing there? Go inside. Okay. Get going. Yep. What the heck is with that girl? She hasn't been home in a long time. She can't even have dinner with her family? She hasn't seen her friends in awhile. Why? Do you feel hurt? Should I tell her to hurry home? Why would I feel hurt? I don't feel that way at all. I'm hungry. Let's eat. Let's wait for Bo-ra. She should be here soon. Did she call you? Is she on her way home? She's staying the night here, right? Don't come back! Goodness, you've been out for a week. Are you that busy? Yes, I am busy, Mom. Jin-ju, aren't you going to say hello to your brother? You've changed so much. I used to be your favorite person. You act like you're the busiest person ever. When you come home, all you do is sleep. You think I should apologize first? But I don't want to. Just say sorry first. Then you're the bigger person. Oh, really? But then I would lose, man. Jin-ju, don't speak too casually to him. You should fix that. Or you'll be in trouble with me. Why is losing bad? When you fought with Gyeong-hui, she apologized to you first. Did you feel like she lost the fight? You didn't, right? You're right. Okay, okay. Why isn't Taek here yet? Does he know that it's his birthday? Of course, he knows that much. Do you think he's stuck somewhere trying to park? -Go outside, check on him. -Ah, that punk. Hey, step aside. I'll park it. Go home first. -I'll do it. -Argh! Everyone is waiting for you. Just go. I'm home. Oh, you came! Taek, why are you so late? The glass noodles are cold now! Get washed up. The kids will be here soon. Okay. Jin-ju, this is for you. Yay! Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Taek Happy birthday to you Taek, you should've come home earlier! We're all busy too, man. Blow out the candles. One, two, three! -Jung-pal, you bought it, right? -Yeah. Here's your gift. Ooh, you bought a nice one. Are you a caveman or what? You're probably the only one alive without a beeper... seriously. What's this? It's actually tasty! She's taking a cooking class. We wrote down our numbers. Beep us, okay? I don't need a beeper. We need it, okay? I don't know how to use it. There isn't much to learn. Just call the number that's flashing. All right. Whenever I come here, it feels so good. What do you mean? It's always the same. It's like my grandpa's place. It's so comfy. Yeah, but honestly, you need to buy a computer. The millennium is coming up. Ooh, you've improved a lot. You even know such a fancy term. Are you kidding me? My TOEIC score was 700. Ooh, Deok-sun. You used to be ranked 989th. You've really moved up. How is Jung-bong doing? He's preparing for the bar, right? These days, my brother manages a chat room. He's the owner of the Quiz Chat Room that learns common sense through a quiz. What? Meaning, he's not studying. He's doing nothing. Ahh. Bo-ra really toughed it out if you think about it. She made it in the end, you know? She lived in the study room and never went home. She's scary. She really is. She's way too persistent. QUIZ CHAT ROOM FIVE USERS All right. JAMES BOND: 1. GENERAL QUIZ {\an8}2. RUBBER 3. MUTE {\an8}MERMAID PRINCESS: PLEASE GIVE US SOME SUGAR. JAMES BOND: NO SUGAR LYNCH BOB: GLOVES! JAMES BOND: GLOVES, CONGRATS They're pretty advanced. Let's keep going. What kind of man is he? Wearing a skirt and singing onstage? Looks like he would go after every woman. He's so good-looking that he even looks good in the skirt. He's a singer-songwriter. He's a very good songwriter. I don't think Kim Won-jun's good looks do him any favors. He would suffer less for his looks than you for yours. Are you kidding? My classmates told me that I look really young. Don't hang out with them. They're not honest. Bo-ra, do you have enough food at home? Do you need more kimchi? Do you want some stir-fried anchovies? How is Hyeon-ju? Are you getting along with her? Make sure you always lock the windows and the door, okay? Oh, right, the washer! I keep forgetting about it. Pour water into the washer and wait for a while. Mom, one at a time. Ask one at a time. You're right. And you know how she is. She'd be fine even in the Amazon jungle. Don't you worry about her. Yeah, I'm not a child. I'm doing quite fine. Don't worry about me. Hey, kids. It's because your mom feels lonely these days. You're living with your friend and only visit us every two to three weeks. Deok-sun sleeps at her friend's place by the airport all the time. No-eul is preparing for his shows, and he often stays out all night. This half-basement house feels so empty. That's why she acts like this. You should come home earlier too. You always have issues at work and come home late at night. I don't see a point in saving up and moving into an apartment. Are you planing to live here forever? -What are you talking about? -Of course not! That's not it. Hello? Yes, hold on. It's the bank. Take it. Yes, speaking. What! Okay... okay, I got it. I'll be there. All right. What? Something happened again? My goodness, what's going on? The one in charge of accounting at Dongdaemun branch... ran off with one billion won. -Oh, my! -I have to go. Finish that first. You don't know when you'll be back. I don't even know where he is now. I have to go and investigate. Well, I'm sorry, Bo-ra. I need to step out. Keep eating... where's my bag? My goodness, I'm so sick of it. Sorry. Go on, keep eating. See you. He's retiring soon. Can't he transfer and do some easy work? Your dad is still full of energy. And he should earn money while he can. He'll stay strong at least for a few good years. He's just fine. Where is Deok-sun, by the way? She doesn't have any flights until tomorrow. Isn't it obvious? The gang's all together. In Taek's room. It's Master Choi's birthday. Jung-hwan came from Sacheon too. Dong-ryong left work early too. Oh, right! Sun-woo came back after a long time too. Sun-woo never comes home because he's always studying. -He must be here for Taek's birthday. -I guess. He's a good-looking boy. Why isn't he dating? What are you talking about, Mom? I saw him a few times. -He has someone. -Really? Then... is Jung-hwan the only one? It must be hard for him to date while living over in Sacheon, right? Mom, worry about your daughters first. How come neither of them have ever introduced a single guy? No one ever calls them by mistake. Do you want to die? Korean guys are not easily satisfied. They're so smart. It's been a while, huh? You must have a death wish! -Hey. -You're asking for a whipping. You must want it badly, huh? Now it feels like home. Hey, I'm popular too. I'll go to a movie tomorrow. If not, it's because I don't want to. He's good-looking. Don't get dumped this time. Seriously? Why would I? I'm the dumper. -All right, all right. -Sure, you dumped him this time. -Don't get upset. -Geez. When did you see him by the way? Earlier, I saw him dropping you off. -We all saw him together. -Hey, he seemed normal. Of course, he's normal. Why wouldn't he? Is he the one your colleague fixed you up with? You're still with him. You haven't been dumped. Seriously, I don't get dumped! I'm the one who dumps guys all the time! -All right! -You always dump them. -You're the dumper, okay? -We got it, definitely! Guys, I'm serious. I dumped them. I dumped them! I did! -Okay, we got it! -Okay, we got it! Deok-sun says she dumped them. I said I dumped them. -It was me! -Okay, Deok-sun. Dumpee, right? You want to get beaten or what? I dumped him! Crap! I dumped him. Seriously, I did. Don't you think that I'm a better dancer than them? Do you even have to ask? Stop it! Hey, we're here. Why did you keep the door open? -It's cold. -Because we knew you were coming. This place is quiet too. Yeah, without the kids around, it sure is quiet. I tried to call you to come over for some soju, but the line was busy. Did you hang up properly? Ah... -Well... -Huh? What? {\an8}JAMES BOND: 1. GENERAL QUIZ {\an8}2. SPACE TRAVEL {\an8}MERMAID PRINCESS: APOLLO 13 NERO WOLFE: SPUTNIK {\an8}LYNCH BOB: STAR WARS MEMORIES OF MAGGIE: MONOPOLY Oh! Oh! JAMES BOND: MONOPOLY, CONGRATS MERMAID PRINCESS: CONGRATS LYNCH BOB: CONGRATS {\an8}NERO WOLFE: PLOTTED? LYNCH BOB: CONCURRENT CONNECTION? {\an8}MEMORIES OF MAGGIE: LUCKY GUESS Hey... You didn't start already, did you? Are we playing Go-Stop today? Mr. Ryu has something to do at school. And your husband isn't home either. It's not fun without them. There's an article about Taek, right? Yes, did you already see it? A famous actress said Taek is her ideal type of guy. Look at this. We saw that too. It happens all the time. It'll die down eventually. Why? If you find someone good, you should marry him off. Oh, no. I don't like celebrities. I hope he meets someone normal. I'd prefer that too. Also, Taek will figure it out on his own. He goes on blind dates quite often. But the relationships don't last. Wow, I thought Taek was naive. It's surprising that he goes on blind dates. Come on. He's not a boy anymore. Oftentimes, he goes on them because he can't say no. What can he do if a higher-up or a senior sets it up for him? He just goes out, has a meal, and goes home. If he keeps that up, he might finally find someone. By the way, I'm sure the kids are teasing him about the article. ACTRESS SHIM SO-YOUNG SAYS, "CHOI TAEK IS MY IDEAL TYPE OF GUY" Hey, Shim So-young must be out of her mind. Why on earth does she like him? Does she know that you can't tie your own shoelaces? Man, I'm disappointed in her. I'm a big fan of hers. Hey, you went on the most blind dates out of all of us. Why are you so bad at dating? You must've aimed too high. Ah... you guys must not know him very well. Hey, you! Be quiet. He just keeps getting dumped. Why is that? At the beginning, they get excited to meet the famous Choi Taek. But after a while, they get frustrated. Because he doesn't talk! Oh, you punk. I tried hard. -Hey, then try harder! -More, dude! -Deok-sun. -Yeah? Why don't you fix us up on a blind date? Forget it. I don't want to get cursed. What's wrong with us? Four on four, including Taek. Okay? Taek, you're in, right? If my schedule allows. Jung-pal, you'll be in Seoul for a while for training. -You should join in. -Not interested. What for? Why bother if I am going to Sacheon? Sacheon, Sacheon, Sacheon! You have no sense of romance. Hey, Jung-pal. Turn on some music. Are there any CDs? CDs? As if Taek would have any. Then turn on anything. Ooh, Jung-pal. Good choice. I'm going to sleep. Deok-sun, you should sleep here too. Are you trying to ruin my future romance? I'll leave after this song. What about your husband? He even works on Sundays? Whenever something happens at the bank, he runs right off. He is working so hard, just to make a little bit of money. I should buy him some herbal medicine. Oh, you know what? When I spend money on my children, I never feel like it's a waste. But when I'm about to spend money on my husband, my hands start shaking. -Is it just me? -Everyone's like that. When Jung-bong or Jung-hwan come in late and ask me for food, I would throw my blanket off of me and prepare food that I don't even make for ancestral rites. But when my husband asks for a cup of ramen late at night... All of a sudden, I would get this anger rising up from my stomach. I would give him a flying kick! But then again, I feel sorry for him. He works so hard to earn money, and he can't even ask for a cup of ramen. I tell myself that I should understand him and hold it in. But, when he asks me to cook late at night... the anger just rises out of me! Gosh, it's so hot! It's cold in here! Put your jacket back on. Stop getting angry! Jung-hwan is home after a long time. Have you seen him as much as you want? Yeah, back of his head only. He hasn't been in Seoul for a long time. He must have lots of stuff to do. I can't really see his face. Of course, that's how it goes! He's so young, and he's been in Sacheon all this time surrounded by soldiers. He must be so happy to be in Seoul. And he really loves being with his friends. And you? Have you seen Sun-woo and Taek enough? Those two are the busiest out of them. I've already seen them enough. I saw them when they had their eyes closed. Goodness. Taek. Taek, let's have breakfast. He must have lost some weight. His cheeks look slimmer. And his nose too. Oh dear. Moo-sung, he's not dead, is he? No, he's breathing. He looks dead. I also have one who sleeps all the time. Oh, I think I know who you're talking about. My little Deok-sun is too diligent, so it can't be her. It must be Bo-ra. By the way, is Bo-ra going to be a prosecutor? A judge? Or a lawyer? She wants to be a prosecutor. Will she pass the background checks? She was involved in the protests. The regime changed. It should be fine. As for me... I'm okay with anything. Congratulations. I don't know when Jung-bong will... my goodness. Come on, you need to catch your breath. Here. That won't get you drunk enough. JUDICIAL RESEARCH AND TRAINING INSTITUTE What's that? A wedding invitation. They're my sixth successful setup. That's some talent. This must be my skill, not law. Don't forget your date on Sunday. I'm only doing it once though. I really don't like this stuff. Okay, okay. You know what, Bo-ra? He's younger than you. What? Lucky you! He's in Yonsei Med School. Three years younger than you. He's my brother's favorite student. He's a genius. I'm only introducing him to you. Only to you! By the way... his nickname is... Garbage. What? It should be fine! He's not just garbage, but genius garbage. Hey, it's better for guys to be that way. I mean, clean freaks are a real pain! Just try meeting him once, okay? Okay, I got it. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL Michol, did you get the old exam for Hematology? How could you sleep now? Sun-woo, studying is not the most important thing in life. It's networking! You've done all you can. Now wait for God's will. Don't you know that? Okay, but did you get it? You said he's a friend of yours. He should be here by now. Hey there, Mr. Kim! Hey there, Mr. Kim! -Nice to see you! -Nice to see you! Did you bring it? Payment first. Sixty-one billion won. -I'll put it in your account. -Here you go. Thanks. I'll pay you back. Don't be such a city slicker. No need to pay me back. Hey, what's your beeper number? You owe me a coupon. Pay me back, okay? Huh, okay. It's 015-273-0917. -0917? -Yeah. Okay. Michol, I'll get going. The professor is looking for me. See you. -Thanks! -Oh, friend. -Nice to see you! -Nice to see you! Ow... Honey! -I'm home. -Oh. Come in. Honey, can you wake me up early in the morning? I need to prepare some important documents. Wash up first. I want to lay down for just a bit. Ow... My goodness. This is it, home sweet home. Oh dear... Lift it a sec. Jung-hwan is going to be late tonight. He'll stop by Dong-ryong's restaurant for a drink after training. I made his favorite dish. Braised cutlass fish. I guess he'll eat it in the morning. Jung-bong! Are you finished? Wash around the sink too! Mother, is there anything else you want me to do? Yes, there is one thing. Hmm, what is it? Study. Well, then... GAMPOMYEONOK Let's go. Hey, thanks for paying. Come on, again? Seriously! How much is it? Let's see. You had five ribs and three bottles of soju. We had three sodas too. The sodas will be on the house. So, 65,000 won plus 6,000 won. That's 71,000 won. But for you, just 70,000 won. Okay, 70,000 won. Four, five, six... seven. Here you go. Thank you. -Have a nice day. -You too. Bye. Brother, I'll finish up here. You can go home first. Okay, I'll go home then. Jung-hwan, drink everything in my restaurant tonight! Yes, Sir! Thank you! -Where are the others? -They're coming. Are they? My goodness, when did they grow up and start drinking? Ooh. Hey, you bought Park Jin-young's first album too? Yeah, I bought it with Lee Moon-sae's book. I really like his songs. They have audio systems on combat planes? Bang, bang! It's pretty cool to fight. Bang! Bang! Bang! Man, you're crazy. Hey, do you remember when we met Park Jin-young in high school? -He was number two. -Wow, you're so smart. I was matched up against someone really great. Matched up? You ran away immediately. I can't lie about anything to you. What are you reading? Are you prepping for the SAT or something? You're unbelievable. It was here. Why are you even interested in this? Aw, seriously. This is the book that you should never read. You don't know a thing about romance. Why don't you ever date? What do you mean? I have. Seriously? Don't even count one or two month-long relationships after a blind date. You barely go on any blind dates anyway. And Sacheon is not an excuse. People in Sacheon meet and date just fine. You still have the ring from the Air Force Academy graduation? What? The fiance ring? Wow, that's an awesome name. Give that to me. Let me use it. It's been a year since you graduated, and you still have it? Just give it to anybody. To whom? I have no girlfriend. I can't give it to her on a first date. That's embarrassing. It's more embarrassing that you still have it. Remember when I saw you with a girl the other day? She was hot. Why not her? Man, you're going to die without ever telling anyone how you feel. You know nothing about romance. I'll give it to you. It's yours. Oh, really? You're giving it to me? I'll give it to my next girlfriend. And get married and have kids. Man, I'm doomed. Thanks for taking care of it. Hey, hey... wait for me. Second lieutenant, let's drink together. I think I know why. I think I know why you don't date. Hold on. The reason you don't date is... Oh, what's that? Let me see. Where are you, Jung-hwan? -Hey, what are you doing? -Jung-hwan, where are you? What are you guys doing? This guy is crazy. -Oh! -Stop it! You're the last one again. Let's head out together. Do you want a ride? Oh... It's okay. I'm all right. You don't need to. Actually, my girlfriend is waiting downstairs. Oh, is that so? She came a long way to Hongik-dong. Hello, Master Choi. Nice to meet you again. Hello. Oh, I heard you're meeting Deok-sun today. Yes, my friends are getting together. I should treat Deok-sun to a decent meal. Don't worry about it. I set her up on a blind date with a student of mine. -Ah... -I think they've been dating lately. I heard they went to see a movie last week. I'm helping them along. I even gave her tickets to see Lee Seung Hwan. Oh, the concert is this Sunday. Would you like to go? A friend of mine is running it. I can get tickets for you. No, I'm good. He's a fan of Deulgukhwa. Ah. Enjoy your date. -Please say hello to Deok-sun. -I will. -Shall we get going? -Sure. Master Choi! It's nice to have Jung-pal here in Seoul and be able to see him often. I drove my car here today. You can ask Deok-sun to drive. She quit drinking. Why? Is something going on? -I bet it won't last long. -I think she's lying. Me too. She couldn't drink at all before, but now she's all grown up and drinking. Soo-yeon! I haven't heard that name in ages, Sung Soo-yeon. How do you remember that? I wonder how the fortune teller is doing, huh? She got everything right in the end. Hi, everyone! I'm here! -Oh! Long time no see, Soo-yeon. -Sung Soo-yeon! -Soo-yeon! -You look different. -Sung Soo-yeon! -Come on in, you're late! Should I just kill them all? Argh, I ought to move to another neighborhood. You all know too much about me. Is there a way to switch my identity entirely? Darn it. Why do you have soda? Did you quit drinking for real? -I'm taking herbal medicine. -Huh. Can you be even healthier than that? You're healthy enough. And you want more? What will happen then? Is it going well with that guy? Isn't it obvious? It'll last one month. Why do you say that? I'm left out in the cold here, but it's different elsewhere. -Where would that be? -Hey! Hey, let's be honest among us. Seriously, you punks! I'm going to a concert with him this Sunday too! That's a lie! No, she's not lying. I heard it directly from Mr. Yoo. See? Don't underestimate me. I'm no pushover. I'm busy on the weekend. I don't have time to watch movies with my old buddies. -Sunday? -Yeah, do you want to go too? Come on, we're all supposed to go watch Forrest Gump together. -I saw it already. -Hey! -Dude! You have no loyalty. -I saw it with him. Why would I watch it with you guys? That's a waste of time. I saw it too. -Argh! -Argh! I forgot. I'm sorry. The people at Go Club wanted to see it so badly. Well, I haven't seen it. How about you, Jung-pal? Me neither. Hey, three guys shouldn't go watch a movie together. It would look weird. So, what is this? You guys see me as a girl, then? All right then. I'll cancel the concert and join you guys. Guess I have no choice. -Hey, you get out! -Just go! Just go home already! -I'd rather go with No-eul. -I just won't go then. I'd rather go with my dad. -I'd rather not go. -I'll go with Jung-bong. -How's he doing? -Are you still here? -Aren't you leaving? -Stop talking about that guy. Can you give me a drink? I can't. You have to drive. What's with your hat? Go outside and paint something! I don't want to go home. My dad... my dad is home. I'm going. Wow. Standing here with all of you brings back memories, right? It was fun back then, even though I was always the last. Right, Deok-sun? Deok-sun, the 989th. Those were good days, right? He's totally wasted. He's spouting nonsense. Get inside before you wake up your parents. I'm going. I'll go wake up my dad! See you. Goodbye, my friend. It's not "friend." It's "friends"! It's plural, you idiot. Okay, good point. Goodbye, my friends! Dad! Bye. Ow... Mom, I'm home. You've slept at home every day lately. Oh dear, you're a good girl. You're a good girl too. You're taking your medicine diligently. Of course, I should remember to take it since you bought it for me. What's been up with Dad lately? He doesn't look well. Your father has a lot of work now. Every week, someone runs off with the bank's money. It's causing such a fuss. Can't he retire already? Bo-ra makes money and so do I. He looks so tired. There's nothing to worry about. If he stops working, he would get sick the same day. It's fine. I'll buy him some herbal medicine tomorrow. Okay. Is it you, Jung-hwan? Yes. Good night. Okay. -Sleep tight, my son. -Okay. -You just arrived? -Yes. Were you still awake? I was about to go to bed. Did you drink? A little. Then don't take any sleeping pills before bed, okay? Alcohol is better than the pills, at least. Right? Yes. Good night. Okay. JAMES BOND: 1. ASSOCIATION QUIZ 2. ROBERT DE NIRO {\an8}NERO WOLFE: ANSWER! THE GODFATHER! {\an8}JAMES BOND: 3.

MERMAID PRINCESS: WHAT'S GOING ON? LYNCH BOB: WHAT IS IT? Mr. Vice Principal, you should sleep in sometimes. It's Sunday today. The same goes to you. Why don't you close the store on Sundays? There are no customers. Why do you open it every day? I would feel like an old man if I didn't do this. All right. Geez, you'll wear yourself out at this rate. You're working even on a Sunday. Don't worry, it won't take long. I'll be back soon. My goodness... Well, honey... I'm not hinting at anything, but... I'm sure you've heard about it. What? What is it? Well... It's called... "voluntary resignation." I only have four or five years left before retirement. I can get twice the retirement payments if I apply for voluntary resignation. No, you can't. Don't even think about it. Of course I won't do it. That's why I told you I'm not hinting at anything. Neither of our daughters are married yet. What would you say to the in-laws? That you're unemployed? You can't do that. We have No-eul too. You have to stay at the bank until all of our kids are married. Do you understand? Of course. Of course, I'll keep working. I'm just mentioning it. Oh my, it's already time. -Why? Finish eating. -I have to go. I'm heading out! I'm meeting classmates and then going to the movies. Okay. Be careful on the road. Drive carefully. Slowly, okay? Drive slowly. Okay, Mom. I'm not a child. This is your first message. I'm so sorry. I don't think I'll be able to make it to the concert today. It's because of a personal issue. Sorry for being disrespectful. I have no excuses for it. I am really sorry. -Deok-sun. -Yeah? Can you go buy bean sprouts? Oh, are you heading out? No, I'll go buy them. Do you need anything else? Well, then get some pork too. -I'll get you some money. -No, no. I have money. Bean sprouts and pork, right? Stop talking and get going. Don't be late! Okay. We still have enough time. -Get going, Taek. -Okay. Hey! What are you doing? I thought you were going to the concert. Darn it. Why aren't you dressed? Ah, you got dumped again? You did go home alone yesterday. You got dumped. You did. No, I didn't. I'm on my way to the concert. That's a great outfit for a concert! You know, the concert is quite a workout. Ah, is that it? Get in. I'll give you a ride. -Deal. -Get in. Open it gently, will you? Be gentle, seriously. Let's go. Deok-sun, my Ferrari can be a little rough. Hold on tight. All right, let's go! See you later, Jung-pal. See you. Yay, let's go! Oh! Hey, it's raining outside. What are you talking about? It was sunny. Maybe it's sunny on a rainy day. When is Sun-woo coming? He only has the morning shift. Hold on a sec. I gave him your number, so he'll beep you when he arrives. KIM JAE-JUN Looks like it's showering. -Where is Master Choi? -He's in the bathroom. What? Isn't that cheating? It's not exactly cheating. I didn't know that he had a long-time girlfriend. He got into a big fight with her and went on the blind date out of anger. Geez, I feel so bad for Deok-sun. Is she waiting by herself right now? Did he tell her? Of course, he's not that awful. He left her a voice message saying that he couldn't go. That's a relief. But Deok-sun is behaving quite-- She went there on her own. -What? -She said she can't waste the tickets. If it were me, I would never go. Why did you introduce her to someone like that? -Who was it? -Sun-woo. He can't make it. What? Why? He has other plans. What plan? All of a sudden? Isn't it obvious? Do... do I have to watch it with you? Oh! Isn't that the guy that Deok-sun is dating? Why is that jerk here? That punk... Ah! Deok-sun got dumped again. Geez, that idiot. Jung-pal, don't you think I look like Tom Hanks? Hey, give me the brochure. You did go home alone yesterday. You got dumped. You did. No, I didn't. I'm on my way to the concert. That's a great outfit for a concert! You know, the concert is quite a workout. Wow, Jung-pal! That's all CG. Hollywood movies are so advanced. Wow... Dude! Where... Sorry. Press one to page, press two to leave a message... Hey, Joey Wong. This is a rare opportunity. It's a free ticket! Hurry up and run! And bring some clothes and shoes with you, okay? Come quickly, okay? You have to come! Damn... Argh... Damn... It's going to start soon. Your boyfriend must not be here yet. Are you the Garbage? What's going on? Why are you here? Fate doesn't visit you often. At the very least, if you want to use the term "fate," it should only happen at the most dramatic moment brought on by coincidence. That's what makes it fate. That's why it's also called "timing." If I had not been caught  at any of those damn traffic lights... If any of those red lights had helped me out even once... I would be standing in front of her,  as if it's meant to be. My first love was always held back by that damn timing. That bloody timing... Are you Garbage? What are you? Why are you here? Answer me first. Hey, what's your beeper number? You owe me a coupon. Pay me back, okay? Huh, okay. It's 015-273-0917. -0917? -Yes. Okay. Michol, I'll get going. The professor is looking for me. See you. You got that? I fixed it up with you because you're my favorite. Yes, sir. My gosh! Ow... it hurts... Mom! Did you hurt it bad? You're at the Twin Grocery? I'll be right there. Ah! You have one message. Hey, it's me. Garbage, Kim Jae-jun. I need to cash in that coupon today. You need to go on a blind date for me. It's at 5:00 p.m.,  at Gamu in Myung-dong. I'll treat you to a meal. Please help me out, just this once. Something really important  came up. Thanks! TWIN GROCERY Jung! Next is Go-game news. On the 16th, the first match  of the Takasu Cup was held at the Hanguk Go Club  in Hongik-dong. Korea's top player Choi Taek 9th dan shocked everyone  by announcing his withdrawal. It is his first withdrawal  since he started his professional career. He informed the organization and his club. He apologized to his opponent, Lim Ji-yeon 9th dan, as well. No details are disclosed as it was a personal matter. He is well known  for his great self-discipline... In the end, fate and timing... do not just happen by coincidence. They are the products  of countless earnest choices that make up miraculous moments. Giving up and making decisions  without reservation or hesitation... That is what makes timing. He wanted her more than I did. I should have been more courageous. It was not the traffic light. Nor the timing. My countless hesitations were to blame. You're really something. He's from my school and my department. How could you go on a date with my classmate? You must not think of me at all anymore. I thought there'd be a one percent chance that it'd be you. But I heard his nickname is "Garbage." I thought that one percent chance was gone. But I gave it a second thought. I considered another one percent chance. I wanted you to hear about it. Same school, same department, and a classmate. I hoped you heard about it. I wanted you to hear. And I know that the chances are low. But, if you still have me in mind, there may be a chance for us to start over. I came here with that hope. Sun-woo, I know this sounds crazy. I missed you. LEE SEUNG-HWAN LIVE CONCERT Hey, I really didn't get stood up. Yeah, I know. He was supposed to come, but he was in a big accident on the way here. I'm not cold. I'm hot. Just wear it. I didn't get stood up, seriously. Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get before you open it. You may get a bitter chocolate. It can't be helped. That's the fate that I have chosen. There are no regrets and no tears. No need for heartbreak. Oh... it's Lee Seung-hwan. They play pretty old songs here. Wow... I went to a lot of his concerts. I still listen to his song at home a lot. Don't you think there are too many interviews? It's just that I feel a little bad for my husband. It's okay to ask me questions. My husband usually doesn't like interviews. My sister asked me to do this, so I forced him to do it. Well... I'm all right with it. I'm ground crew now, so I have time. Oh, you're here. Hey, say hello to them. Oh, nice to see you again. I'm counting on you. Oh, hello. Here. You can head home first. I won't bother you today. You can go work. It's no bother. I like interviews. It's fine. You can go. -I'm leaving then. -Okay. -Hey. -Yeah? Honey, can you take care of the food waste? Come on... I already did it on my way to the comic book store. Hey... stop reading comic books. You didn't borrow those weird comics again, did you? Stop reading comic books. -Mind your public image. -Okay. Thank you. Good luck. What are you doing? This is scary! Taek is sleeping, and you're sleeping too. Do you guys just come here to sleep? Why do you come home if you're just going to sleep? It's because I'm really tired. I sleep well when I'm at home. Let me sleep a little more. When can I sleep in, if not now? Mom, I'm hungry! Give me food! I think I'm hungry! Oh! You scared me. What are you doing here? Your breakfast is ready. You can have it now. Why didn't you wake me up? We didn't wake you on purpose, so that you can sleep in. Still, why are you standing there, when you could've woken me up? I'll be out soon. Come right out. I made your favorite, braised cutlass fish! Oh, holy crap! You startled me! When did you get in? Hey, when did you get in? "Hey"? You looking for trouble, huh? What's with you? We're both aging together. -Darn it. -Careful how you talk to me. Huh? Do you want to die? Why are you hitting me? You don't know why? Because you did something wrong. Argh! Stop it! The day just started! You speak so rudely! Am I your friend? I'm your older sister, okay? Hey, what are you two doing? You're all grown up now! Come out and eat! Well, now it feels like home. It seems like Deok-sun only acts like that to get hit. She asks to be beaten. By the way, why does Bo-ra sound like that? I think her voice sounds pretty weak. Her screaming sounds weaker than before, doesn't it? Oh, my... her condition must've weakened. If she were any healthier, she'd wrap her sister up and eat her. Dad, your nose is bleeding. Oh dear! Your nose... Here. Oh, my God. Tilt your head back. I must have picked my nose too much. Why am I... Come now and eat your breakfast! I'm fine, I'm fine. Is Jung-hwan going back already? Yes, his training is over. He's going back to Sacheon tomorrow morning. We're all going to have drinks tonight. Can you come? I have a match, but it may finish early. I think I can go. Why do you have so many matches? You should do less! -Okay. -It serves you right. And if you only plan to sleep at home, don't bother coming at all! Hey... You think you're the only student? Why don't you eat and go back to sleep? Okay? Don't you laugh. And don't you dare date Shim So-young. Okay. Don't worry. Wow, I didn't know that she's talks that well. Grade-schoolers are the scariest nowadays. More soup, please. Of course, that's my favorite thing to hear. Sun-woo, let's play catch later. You need to exercise. No, I don't want to. You throw too hard. I won't do it. You have to exercise. You need to be fit to study. I'm all right. I want to sleep. Sun-woo! All right, all right. I'll do it. OCTOBER, 1994 Turn down the volume! Before I kick you out in your underwear. Oh, such a harsh thing to say! Honey, the anniversary of your mother's death is coming up. Oh, such a deep intention! We still have two or three weeks, don't we? Take it easy. My mom doesn't need much. October... I'm heading out to meet the gang. I'm meeting the guys. I'll be back soon. I'll give you a ride. Okay, let's go. Hey, seat belt. Oh, you're right. Jung-pal, you're going for a drink. Is it okay to take your car? You can drive it back. Geez... Turn on some music. Okay. You only have Lee Moon-sae. That's right. Just put on whatever you want. I love his songs. Even now, I still like them. It's so obvious. Saying that is a waste of time. Can you be a little gentler? All right. Which album was this again? Was it his third? It's his fourth, stupid! Released in 1987! People forget things! You can't call me stupid! How can you work as aircrew with such a bad memory? Stop this nonsense! As someone who also flies, I feel ashamed. You feel ashamed? Yes, ashamed. -Okay, victory! -Victory! Who says "victory" instead of "cheers"? When will you be back once you leave this time? I'm not emigrating. You should visit every two weeks. That's exhausting. You can come in your combat plane. You'll get here fast. Deok-sun, I really like that you stay the same. It was a joke. What about Taek? Is he coming? Yeah, he is coming. I called the club and he had already left. He should be here soon. Do you think he got lost again? How can a Go player get lost on the road? He's starting again. He plays Go-game and yet gets lost on the road. I don't get it. Jung-pal, did you bring the ring? What ring? Oh, you mean the fiance ring. What's the fiance ring? It's a commemorative ring for the Air Force. He still has that thing. I brought it. -You're giving it to me, right? -I'm thinking about it. Giving it to you may be a waste. Then who would you give it to? Dude! You're going die before you propose to anyone. Really, Jung-pal isn't very romantic. Whatever, you idiot. Hey, it's my wish to see you confess your feelings to someone before I die. Are you going to live alone forever? You're so frustrating... Deok-sun. I was going to give it to you when I graduated. I'll give it to you now. I like you. I like you. Hey... you know what I've done because of you? I waited an hour every day to go to school with you. At night, I couldn't sleep at all... worrying about you until you got home. "Why is she so late?" "Did she fall asleep again?" Hey. I thought of nothing but you. Just you. He must be serious. Just stay put. When I ran into you on the bus, when we went to the concert, and when I got that shirt from you on my birthday, I was... so happy that I thought I was going crazy. I think he really means it. I wanted to see you more than a dozen times a day. I was happy just to see you. I've wanted to tell you for a long time. I really like you. I love you. Are you satisfied now, idiot? About what? You said that this was your wish. What wish... Oh, man! You startled me! I thought that was real, you crazy punk! -What the heck was that? -I'm so shocked! Oh, you believed it too, right? Dude! He's a pro! You completely fooled me. Wow, oh my gosh. Jung-pal, I'm fluttering. I think I've fallen for you. Let's date. I love you. I waited for you at the bus station and the study rooms-- -Get away, crazy bastard. -Oh my... I was totally fooled by you. Hey, Deok-sun. Give me the menu. It's on Jung-pal today. Can't believe what just happened. Look! My hands are shaking. Why am I shaking... My goodness... That can't happen between friends. I was so surprised. Oh, my God... I love you. -Man! -Can I get another glass? Geez! Are you a ghost? What? Haven't you seen someone in a hanbok before? You're such a character. My costume changed. Isn't it better? It's the best when you do nothing. What the heck! What are you doing? Did it change to a hanbok now? -Yeah, isn't it pretty? -No, it's not. Jung-pal, what are you doing? Knock first. Go home early. Let my mom know if you need more! -Hey, No-eul. -Yeah? -Is Deok-sun home? -Yes. -Oh, she is. -Yes. Okay. Hey, give her this. What is it? A gift. Huh? A gift. Isn't that obvious to you? It's for Christmas. Huh? A Christmas gift! Give it to your sister! Go. Just go and give it to her. Go now! Why are you standing there? Your mom is calling you. Go! What now? I said give it to her! Come here! I'll give it to her. Bring it here. At that time, Jung-bong... -What? -He didn't know that his pocket... You crazy punk! He came earlier and said something else... It was a week ago. Yeah, and I carried him on my back. Sun-woo, page Taek and tell him to come to the next place. Okay. Thanks for paying, Jung-pal. Man, that punk is a real pro. Any girl would fall for him. {\an8}Subtitle translation by: Alison Woods
