 - Hey, Harry! I thought that was your bike. - You should have called me. I was sitting at home doing a bunch of nothing. I went by your house, but I saw your brother's car. Well, hello, Marissa. I've missed you. And jackpot. Well, I can't stay for long, 'cause my grandma's in town. And my mom forgot to pick up her foot cream, so I was just passing by--

 Jesus Christ, your face. Did Billy do that to you? - Uh-huh. Got him back pretty good though. I think I even gave him a black eye. - Yeah? With, uh--with big brothers like that, huh? Want me to go home, pack you a bag? - You think I should run? A lot of good that did me the last time. - You wanna spend the night at my place then? Let him sleep it off or whatever? - Think I wanna sit around with your mom and your old ass grandma?

 - You'll get used to it. - No, thanks. - Want me to fuck him up for you? - Couldn't fuck up a June bug, you fucking dildo. - Fuck you up if you don't watch it. Come on, you want some, huh? Huh? - Fuck you, Smitty. - Fuck you, too, Harry. Well, I, uh, better get going. My mom is gonna kill me if I don't get back soon, and grandma can be a real bear when her feet get sore. So, uh...gross. Maybe this will cheer you up. Harry? You sure you're good? I'm around if you need me. And don't eat all my peanut butter cups! - S--Smitty? - Whoa! I told you I wasn't through with you when your bitch ass ran away. - Please, Billy, I said I was sorry. - Not sorry enough. Not yet anyway. - Please, Billy, come on! No! Billy, I'll fix the dent, I swear to God. - Oh, I know you will. But right now, I'm just--uh, I'm just collecting what I'm owed. - Ah! What are you gonna do, huh? You filthy piece of shit! - Stop, please! - I'm gonna break you! - Billy, stop! Come back here! Come and get your beating! You're dead, Harold! Fucking dead! Harold! I'm coming for you! I'll fucking kill you! Better run! Harold! I'll fucking kill you! - Uh! Harold, I'm gonna find you! - God! I'm gonna fucking kill you this time! Harold! Harold! Where'd you go? - Help! Help! Let me in! - Please, please! - Billy, I'm sorry! Billy? - What the fuck? Harold, where'd you go? You are fucking dead when you come home! You little piece of shit! - Ah! - "There's no way to explain what's happened. - But after my Mavis died-- - But after my Mavis died, I grew terribly lonely. My Mavis had finally succumbed to her illness. And so after nearly 40 years of wedded bliss, it was time to say goodbye. And what was harder than anything in the days and months that followed, harder than I could've possibly ever imagined, was the loneliness. A loneliness that existed in every nook and cranny of the life me and my Mavis had built together. - So lonely that I decided to create... a companion. - Working a farm makes a man quite handy. There ain't nothing you don't encounter over the years. Mavis herself used to say, "There weren't nothing I couldn't build if I just had the right tools." Truth be told, it was kinda fun, too. Took my mind off things. Lost myself into working nights. It began to occupy my mind during every waking hour, an obsession I couldn't shake. I was nearly there, but something was still missing. Which is when I found it. And wouldn't you know it, it came from my Mavis herself. An old heart for my new companion. - Something about the combination of ingredients, perhaps the strange bones from the field or the Valentine's heart my Mavis had given me, perhaps even my own desires had given it life. And for a short time... it was lovely. - But as men wiser than me have said... nothing good lasts forever. - I couldn't live with myself for having created it. A little girl was dead because of me, because of my creation. - Which is why we belong dead. Both of us. My companion and me. - Hey, Straw Dick! Eat crow! - Ah! - Hey, Billy. Wake up. You finally come home for your beating? - Ugh! - Uh! What the fuck do you think you're doing? - I'm just, uh-- I'm just collecting what I'm owed. Look, I know you two have been waiting anxiously for my decision. When the Metega IBO closes tomorrow, Myan Capital Group is going to become one of the richest private equity groups in the country. And in the process, offering you, Celia, or you, Tom, the opportunity of a lifetime. - Did you feel that? - Mm-hmm. Maybe a 3.2 on the Richter. Probably out somewhere near Palmdale. Now, back to business. One of you is going to be Midtech's new CFO. - Start practicing your French, Tom. - Lydia, I--I don't know what to say. I won't let you down. I know you won't. You are one of the best financial magicians that I've ever encountered. So I'm counting on you to keep this new ship afloat. - I won't let you down. - I, uh--I need to call my wife. - Seriously? Tom Harding? - Cee. - Jesus, Lydia, you just set us back 20 years. - He's being transferred to Switzerland, Cee. - You were never gonna let me be you, were you? - I thought you'd be relieved. Besides... I don't wanna lose you. - You were supposed to have my back, Lydia. Isn't that what you preach at all these conferences? How successful women owe it to the rest of us? Bring us along, lift us up? Us against the brutes? - Oh, who cares about a CFO position, Celia? - I...care. - When the IPO settles, there is going to be so much money, we can do anything that we want. Travel the world like we talked about. Maybe even let those morons at the club talk me into running for office. Just imagine. The two of us celebrated everywhere, smashing through barriers, changing the world. - You don't get it, do you? That CFO position was going to be the beginning of my life. The beginning of my rise. And I stupidly assumed that you were going to help me get there. What a fucking idiot I was to have believed in you. - Darling, there are going to be other opportunities. - You're a fraud, Lydia. You know that? You're a first-class, hypocritical fraud. - Look, I knew you were going to be disappointed-- - Disappointed? No. My eyes are open, finally, thanks to you. All of this bullshit about being a paragon of women's empowerment, I mean, littering the floors with the shards of glass ceilings that you've shattered. Well-curated bullshit, my dear, but bullshit all the same. - Maybe we should just take a step back here. - You're afraid of me, aren't you? - Afraid? - I'm younger, I'm smarter. I am a threat to you, aren't I? - I don't even recognize the person that I'm talking to here. - Of course you don't. I am so far above you, you couldn't find me in the clouds. Do you really think that traveling the world, holding your hand in Hong fucking Kong with a Stepford smile on my face, everyone kissing your ass? You really think that's gonna cut it? - You just hang on a minute here-- - I didn't bust my ass at Wharton for this. I deserved that promotion. And to hear that you just want a sidekick, that is not my future. I am not an appendage to the brilliant and powerful Lydia Lane. - Don't you think I see who you are? Who you can become? - You have a funny way of showing it. - I just want a life together. That's all. Me and you. - That's a fucking laugh. You think, after all of this, that I can ever look you in the eye again? - Mm. - Damn, you are clueless. - Don't say something that you don't mean... and that you can't take back when you calm down. - Do you really think that all those little spa trips out to the Greenbriar and to Canyon Ranch can keep the rust at bay, Lydia? - Please. - Christ, you fucking cow. Just wait until the world hears how you lied to them, and how every woman on this planet should just run the other direction as they see you coming-- - Stop! - Assault? Perfect. First the police, then "The Times." I'm going to ruin you. You're done. You are fucking done. - Where do you think you're going? You're not going anywhere! Sit down! - Let me go! Celia? Oh, my God, Celia. - Oh my God. - Celia. Oh, my God, I'm so-- I'm so sorry. I'm so--I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - Oh. - Celia? Miss Lane? Miss Lane, you still here? - Hey. - Hi. - We're closing up. Everyone's getting ready to celebrate Tom's promotion. Everything okay? - Yeah, Celia's just a little upset about losing to Tom. I'm trying to get her to go home. You know, have the valet bring her Tesla around and leave the keys under the visor. I'll catch up later. - Oh, gee. - Lydia. Hey, Kevin said--I mean-- how's Celia taking all of this? - It hit her kinda hard. - Well, she's a tough one. She'll bounce back. - Yeah. - You-- - Uh-- - You wanna-- - No, no, I forgot something. - You go on ahead. - You sure? - We'll catch up. - Okay. - Save some champagne for us. - I'll do it. - Okay. - Everybody's gone. - Everybody's gone. It was just an accident. It was a terrible accident. You--you were so upset. I should have never have let you drive. Should have never have let you drive. Ah! - No service? - Looks like those weekends at the Greenbriar weren't a waste after all. - Lydia! Oh no, oh no. Oh no, oh no. Oh. --this is a recording from Federal Emergency Management Authority. A major 7.2 magnitude earthquake has been reported in the Los Angeles basin. There's a citywide blackout. First responders are getting to buildings as fast as they can to access damages-- --people are advised to shelter in place until further notice. This is a recording from Federal Emergency Management Authority. A major 7.2 magnitude earthquake has been reported in the Los Angeles basin. - No. - Ow. Hello? Anyone there? This is the fire department. Hello! Anyone in these elevators? I can hear you. Can you hear me? Can you speak? Do you need medical assistance? Can you tell me how people are with you in that car? Hello? Are you still here? - Lydia. Bang on something if you can hear me. Can you tell me your name? Hello? Are you still there? Hello! Ma'am! - What the fuck is happening? - Coming as fast as we can. Just stay calm. - Stay calm. Stay calm. Stay calm. - I can't fucking stay calm! You--you-- This was your rise, huh? You think that going to Wharton means that you get to be me? You don't get to be me... unless you're me. I'm the one with the empire! I'm the Woman of the Year. I'm the Woman of the Year. Not you. I'm smarter now. I always win. I always win! Hello? Hello? Are you still there? - What? What time is it? There you are. It's Saturday night. - Saturday--Saturday night? I--it's been 24 hours. I mean, I--I know I have meetings, I need my car. I need--where's the bathroom? We're approaching your building, Ma'am. Making our way to the lobby now. Just stay calm, we're coming as fast as we can. No. - You were just-- Ma'am, what just happened? Can you tell me what's happening in there? I gotta get out of here. You're okay. You're okay. It's just--it's just-- - I'm getting out of here. - Lydia. - Lydia. - I'm here! Hello! Hello! Help! - Lydia. Lydia. - Lydia. - Lydia. No, let go! Celia! Let go, let go. Celia.
