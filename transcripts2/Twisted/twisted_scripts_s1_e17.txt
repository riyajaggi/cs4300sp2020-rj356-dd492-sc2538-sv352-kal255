 Previously on "Twisted"... There's been a car accident. It's Vikram. I'm sorry, but he's dead. Someone moved his body. Put it in that car. Is someone trying to protect us? Nights have been below the 30s this last week, haven't they? It's awfully cold to be driving with your window down. - How are you doing, Jack? - Danny. You remember Whitney, right? My little girl. - I was looking for you. - Lacey. Do you mind showing her around?

 - Sure. - Lead on, my student guide. Before Jo, I had another baby. Maybe finding that child will help us find our way back. When I came to Green Grove, I was coming from juvie. - Did you know Danny? - He swore to me that once he got out, he would find his dad and kill him. Why can't you just tell me what's wrong? - I killed my dad! - If it was self-defense, then why didn't you just come forward? I told Lacey the truth about my dad. We broke up. She said that there's something between us. Haven't you lied to me enough?

 - You were there, I didn't... - You manipulated me. And I covered for you, Danny. No wonder you are so worried about becoming your dad... you are just like him. * You win, I give up... * (Tires squealing) (Rock music continues through radio) (Car door closes) Yo, man. What's up? Why'd you do it? - Calm down. - Why did you tell her? Tell who? You know who... Jo. You told her I wanted to kill my dad? That I talked about it in juvie? Well, you did talk about it. What does it matter? I mean, your dad... he died in the car wreck. I'm done screwing around with you, Charlie. Look, when I told her about juvie, it just came out, okay? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to screw things up for the two of you. I think you did. Well... sorry you feel that way. I'll talk to Jo. And I'll just tell her that everything you said in juvie was... No. Don't talk to Jo about me. Ever again. You got it? Yeah. Got it. - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com - Oh, crap. I fell asleep. I gotta get back before Whitney wakes up. Aww, five more minutes. I've already called and told her you were going to be late. Not this late. (Door opens) Thought you might be shacked up here. Fun night? So, Whitney, it's your first day at Green Grove High, huh? You nervous? Not really. This is like my fourth school, so I got it down. Yeah. Whitney's great at making friends, right? Just like my daddy. - Excuse me. - Sorry. That's okay. Well, uh... You know, if you have trouble finding your classroom or, you know, anything, I'm sure Danny could help you. Right, Danny? I do know where the classrooms are. I will be fine. I've already met some really cool people. Like Lacey. Danny's ex. Ex? Yeah. It's fine. Don't worry about it. Uh, Danny, how's soccer? It's good. Yeah, it's going good. I'm actually going to head in. I got this trig test I need to study for. Mom, can I talk to you for a second? Sure. Bye, guys. (Mouths) I'm sorry you had to find out about me and Jack this way, but... Look, I told Lacey. Oh, my God. - And then she... - She broke up with me, yeah. Well, did you explain that it was an accident? - I mean, did you tell her that... - Trust me. She knows everything now. But she's not going to tell anyone. They may be mad at me, but they don't want me to go to jail. - "They"? - Yeah, Jo's not exactly in my corner right now, either. (Sighs) She accused me of being like dad. Well, that's ridiculous. You're nothing like him. I guess not. If you don't want to be him, then don't be him. It's that simple. Let's roll, future stepbro. Can't be late on my first day. (School bell rings) Hey, how are you? Fine. I, uh... I heard that you and Danny broke up. Word travels fast. Yeah. I'm just really sorry. What do you have to be sorry for? Just... that it happened. And that you're hurting. But honestly, I think you're better off. I mean, we're both better off. I really don't want to talk about this right now. Okay, you're right. I agree. I just... if you do want someone to listen, or hang out with, I'm here, okay? Good to know. That looked tense. Girl trouble? It's nothing. How's your first day of school going? Well, the first 10 minutes have been amazing. It's like I've been a green grove grizzly my entire life. It's important to embrace the school mascot. It was a grasshopper at my last school, so this is definitely an upgrade. You sure you're okay? I... I'm great. I'm just late for music class. I'll see you around, Whitney. Hope so. And then principal tang started acting all condescending, like... "don't take on more than you can chew, young lady." - He called you "young lady"? - No. I added that part. But it was in his tone. I mean, government is all about biting off more than you can chew. - Yeah. - Would F.D.R. have come up with the new deal if he was chewing the appropriate amount? No, he probably would have just sat in his wheelchair and, you know, played board games and stuff. Exactly. I have to strike while the iron's hot. You're so awesome. You're going to be such a kickass president. Thanks, Rico. I hope you're right. I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed. Well, hey, let me take you out tonight. Give that presidential brain a rest. It's food truck night in town. We can eat. And then, you know, go back to my place and watch a movie or something. I don't know, I have so much going on. Oh, come on. Even presidents need to relax. Why do you think they built camp David? Plus, you haven't seen my loft yet. That's true. I haven't. So is it a date? It's a date. I'm late for a class. I'll see you later. I don't get it. Now you want an "F"? No, I just want what I deserve... whatever it is. - It's an "F." - Okay, fine. Fail me. And I'm not going to take the equipment back, I swear. Donating all that stuff for a grade, it wasn't me. That's not the kind of person I want to be. You really want me to give you an "F"? I'll take a make-up test. I'll do extra credit work. Whatever it takes. I'm bringing my grade back up. And this time, I'm earning it. (School bell rings) Hey! I've been looking for you. Oh, here I am. Someone following you? What? No, no. No, I just... Wow, someone's really lost their cool, huh? Seriously, what... what is it? Um, Danny kind of... found me last night, and he, uh... What happened? Let's just say he wasn't too thrilled that I told you what I told you. But it's not a big deal. Don't worry about it. Did he threaten you? Maybe a little. But it's just guy stuff. I shouldn't have said anything. No, I'm really glad that you did. I'm sorry that he did that. It's not your fault, Jo. I know, but... Danny and I, we have... our own stuff, and I just... I shouldn't have put you in the middle of it. I know how you can make it up to me. Let me take you out tonight. Well, that's the last adoption agency I could find. Maybe Vikram took care of it privately. Maybe. Did he say anything else to you? Tell you anything at all? No. I didn't want to know anything. I trusted him. (Scoffs) Yeah. That's pretty clear. It was your idea to do this, Kyle. I know. Do you really want to help me? Or just make me feel worse? - Tess... - No, it's fine. I have to go. Everything okay? Yeah, fine. Any updates on Green Grove's newest millionaire? Well, she had an interesting guest last night. And this morning. That boat guy, Jack... the one who used to work for Vikram... stayed the entire night. Really? So now you're threatening Charlie? Is that what he said? That I threatened him? Yeah, Danny, but he didn't even have to. He was totally freaked out. Look, what he told you last night... about me and my dad, it was... - Was the truth? - It's not that simple. Did you say it? Did you talk in juvie about killing your dad? Yes. But it's more complicated than Charlie made it sound. You used me. You planned all of it. You can't really believe that. Did you know about the money? Did you know about the $10 million when you used me - to get to your dad? - No. Charlie is manipulating you to get between us. There is no "us"! Stay away from Charlie, and stay away from me. (Indistinct chatter) Hey! So what's the deal with that lit teacher, Mr. Avedon? I've never had Avedon. Oh. So I guess you don't know if he always wears those tight V-neck tees that show off his little man boobs? Wow, thank you for that mental image. Just paying it forward. What are you up to tonight? Um, I don't know. Probably homework and watch some TV. My mom's actually taking my little sister to go get her ears pierced, so I thought I'd go and watch. Are you trying to depress me? Because you're doing an amazing job. Let's go into the city. The city? As in New York City? As in "The Big Apple," yeah. There's this great club I like to go to. - I'm kind of a regular. - Club? Wait. They don't care that you're underage? Nobody cares about that stuff when you're besties with the bouncer. - Okay. - Trust me. The best way to get over a breakup... get the hell out of dodge for a night. (Sighs) My mom would never let me go. Then don't tell her. Make something up. Live a little dangerously, my God. (Sighs) Whitney: And then after dinner, she's taking me on a night tour of Green Grove. I think it'll really help me begin to appreciate the town. You know? Yeah, it sounds like fun. It will be. Lacey's a sweetheart. Be careful, hon. You know you tend to make close friends a little too quickly. Don't worry about it, daddy. I know what I'm doing. Kyle: Hello. Chief. What can I do for you? Please, Jack. Call me Kyle. I just heard about your shop. I thought I'd come by and check it out. You in the market for a boat? I am. My wife says it's an indulgence, but I figure a guy's gotta go with his gut, you know? Yeah, those wives. They be nagging. (Chuckles) Chief, this is my daughter, Whitney. Whitney, this is the chief... Kyle Masterson. Oh, as in Jo Masterson's father. I love her. She rocks. (Chuckles) I feel the same way. All right. I gotta go try on some outfits. Okay. Nice to meet you, Chief. Well, she seems like a handful. You have no idea. So what kind of boat are you interested in? Honestly... the affordable kind. All right. Well, let me get my price book and, um... we'll see what we can find. Be right back. So you took this from his trash? I had to wait till he put it out. - Isn't it still... - On the curb, it's public. Legit. Get it to the lab. I want the DNA results ASAP. Might take a couple of days. Put a rush on it. Call in a favor. If we can match the DNA on this to one of the hairs we pulled from the car, it'll at least be enough for us to bring him in. Okay, okay. I'm on it. Okay. Karen. Karen... - Wait. - What? (Sighs) I just, uh... how have you been? (Scoffs) Let's not do this, okay? Just give me a second, please? I know you're still hurt. And angry. But I need you to know, Vikram and I... we never had an affair. - Right. - We didn't. I swear. There was another reason. What was it? (Sighs) It's, um... I... - (Sighs) - Goodbye, Tess. I had another baby. I had nowhere else to turn, and Vikram helped me give her up. I just told Kyle about it, and I still haven't told Jo. I thought you should know. I did know. Vikram told me. Danny, what are you doing here? You don't really think that it was premeditated. You can't actually believe that. You need to leave. Now. You were there. You saw what he was like. Why I hit him. He was trying to hurt us. What about the church? You didn't expect me to be there. You planned to meet him alone. I just wanted you to be safe. Or you didn't want any witnesses. Please just go. Leave. I'll go... and I'm not going to bother you anymore. But I did not plan to kill my father. It just happened. And deep down, I think you know that. You killed your dad? And then he went after Danny, so Danny grabbed a piece of wood and hit him with it. And... well, Vikram, he, um... I mean, I don't even know what to say. - This is... - It's insane. I know. Danny, what about the car? I mean, they found your dad's body in that... in that wreck, the car accident. Someone moved the body and made it look like an accident. Jo. Stop. Wow. Okay, then, um, why didn't you go to the police? Say that it was self-defense. Because we didn't, and you need to forget all this, okay? Okay, you're not helping, Danny. Look, I get it. You can trust me. I'm not going to tell anyone. Then why am I so worried? Okay, just go. I'm sorry. We can leave when he's gone. Where are you guys going? Out. On a date. (Scoffs) I can't believe you knew all this time. Vikram swore me to secrecy. He said you never wanted to talk about it. Did he threaten to tell Kyle? I mean, is that why you kept it a secret? No. Vikram wasn't always bad, Karen. At least back then. But you regret it now. I regret a lot of things. I mean, trusting him. Vikram. I don't know. I... I just wish I knew more. I know where he kept the adoption papers. He told me he was hanging on to them in case you ever... Do you want to find your child? Of course I do. Jo: You're still really freaked out, aren't you? A little. A little? I'd be running away screaming by now. No, I... I want to be here. I'm just... processing. But, look, I mean, it sounds like self-defense. I don't think Danny would... I don't want to talk about Danny. Okay. Well, I mean, what about you? How are you handling all of this? I don't know. I want to say that I'm okay, but I... I just don't want it to affect the rest of my life. You know? It won't. If you don't let it. We all have messed-up stuff from our past. You just find a way to survive it. Wow, that was really cheesy. It's really sweet. Jo? Jo, hey! Hey, look at that. Great minds think alike. Did you guys just get here? Yep, just taking my lady out on the town. My lady? Are you a 15th-century knight all of a sudden? No, but I am the first man of Green Grove High. Congrats again on the win, Andie. Thanks. I owe it all to you. You earned it. All right... should we continue the food tour, my lady? Definitely. I'll see you guys later. Have fun, you crazy kids. Who knew, huh? Food trucks, the most romantic spot in Green Grove tonight. Oh, darn, I have like seven texts from student council people. I'll be right back, okay? Lacey: Okay, so... He was in juvie with you. Why didn't you tell me before? Because... because he asked me not to. Look, I didn't think it was that big a deal, but now, I don't know... everything about this guy is weird. He shows up when I'm on the run. He enrolls in my school, starts hanging out with my friends, and he gets a job at the horse stables where you have a horse? And now he's off with Jo... Jo? (Sighs) I get it. You're jealous. No, that's not what this is about. Of course it is. Hey. Look, um... I know that you're hurt. And that you're mad, and I'm sorry. Fine, whatever. I have to go. Wait, wait, wait. There's something off about this Charlie guy. And now that he knows what happened with my father, I'm worried. I just... I think he might be dangerous. - You sound paranoid. - No. I'm not. I'm telling you. This is real, and I'm going to prove it. (Softly snorting) So he, uh, he just showed up asking for a job? Yep, a few weeks back. Kid's a good worker. So you said you're a friend of his? Yeah, yeah. We go way back. Did he say anything else? Give you a sense of why he came here? No, Charlie doesn't say much. Poor kid was desperate, though. He asked me for a job... - a place to live. Oh, sorry. - (Phone vibrates) That was very nice of you to take him in like that. No sweat off my back. Yeah, he needed a... a local residence to enroll at Green Grove High. Kid was 18, so I didn't ask a lot of questions. You know, he's usually home by now. If you want to head on up to his room, say hello? (Squeaking) Yo, man, I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you, too, man. Uh, what are you looking for? Uh... my photo. You know the one with me and Lacey and Jo? Can't find it. It's vanished. (Sighs) Well, maybe... I mean, maybe one of the, uh, you know, the guards took it. My photo? Why would they take my photo? Dude, I mean, you know how they can be. Look, I'm... they're going to come for me any minute and I really don't want to leave without it. Uh... okay, well... well, if I find it, then maybe I can send it to you. Thanks, man. (Door opens) It's like he never left, huh? I don't like coming in here ever since... Well, since the first time Vik died. I'm actually thinking of turning this into a pilates studio. Karen, thank you for doing this, even though... It's fine. I guess we all have secrets, huh? Yeah. Especially Vikram. Who knows what secrets are hiding in this thing. (Chuckles) Yeah. I just can't figure out why he would fake his own death. I mean, did he ever explain it to you? No. All he told me was that his life was in danger. In danger? From who? He wouldn't say. (Opens drawer) I sort of got a sense it was someone he worked with. I mean... maybe a business deal gone wrong or something. I don't know. Yeah. Or something. - Are those the... - Yep. (Dance music playing) * Hey, hey, hey * * hey, hey, hey * * hey, hey, hey * * yeah, look, do your thing * * with what you got * * make a drink, just make it hot * * do your thing... * People are staring at us. That's because we're hot. Hi. (Sighs) So... I assume that you have some sort of master plan to buy alcohol without an I.D. Yeah. I'm not buying it. He is. Oh, and he's coming. Hey. I'm Kevin. I'm Whitney. This is my friend, Lacey. Well, it looks like I'm just in time. Oh, yeah? In time for what? To beat the mad rush of lovestruck guys. First is always best, right? Clearly. What do you do, Kevin? I'm a trader. Wall Street. Impressive. I bet you're real good with money. Yeah. Good at spending it on beautiful women. Can I get you girls drinks? Um, yes. Yes, please. Kevin to the rescue. * Do your thing, do your thing * * do your thing, just make it hot * (Echoing) * make it hot... * (Indistinct chatter) (Phone vibrates) Student council? Mm-hmm. Don't you hate it when people return calls at the dinner table? (Chuckles) Yeah. Okay, well, I'll be right back. How is it? It's messy. So... Earlier you said something about messed-up stuff from your past. Yeah. I guess I sort of opened myself up with that one, huh? Yeah. All right. Let's hear the questions. Fire away. Okay. Last night you said you went to juvie because you stole a car, right? So... why did you? Um... I was young. I was angry. Stupid. My mom had recently died. And, um, my dad left when I was really little. So I was alone. Um... so they put me in this... in this foster home. But the people there, they basically ignored me. So I, I don't know, I fell in with this group of older guys. I guess you could say they weren't really the best role models. (Chuckles) Charlie, I'm... I'm really sorry. Ah, you don't have to... don't be. I mean... Life's all about second chances, right? Um, do you... Do you want a soda? Sure. Don't move. I'll be right back. Hey. Hey. Where's Andie? Oh, she's just, you know, off on the phone with the student council gang. You know, presidential stuff. Mm-hmm. This must be how Michelle Obama feels. Huh? (Chuckles) Oh, you want a salmon skin roll? Are they good? No. Not really. Yeah, raw fish off a truck wasn't really... my best decision. Where's, uh... where's Charlie? Oh, he's getting us drinks. Do you want me to stick around till Andie gets back? Oh, no. No. It's not really like a big deal. You know, she's just super busy. So it's not like I'm worried, you know, that it's something else or anything like that. You're worried that it's something else, aren't you? Yeah. Yeah, kind of. You know, I... I just really like her, you know? Well, from where I'm sitting, she's crazy about you. Don't worry about it. Charlie seems pretty nice. Yeah. I like him. Well, I'm happy for you. (Phone vibrates) You know, Lacey, you remind me of this girl that I dated back at Dartmouth. Is that so? It is. But you are way sexier than her. Oh, well, thank you, Kevin. So, uh, where do you live? East or West Side? Oh, neither. I live in Green Grove. - Upstate, nice. - Yeah. What do you do there? I go to high school. You know, I was captain of the lacrosse team in high school. Staying in the city tonight? Because I am pretty good friends with the concierge at the St. Regis, and if you want, I could get us a sick room with a... Okay, Kevin, thank you so much for the drinks and the stimulating conversation. This has been delightful. Ah, ta-ta. (Laughing) I can't believe that guy. Whoa! I know. Did you notice the tan line around his left ring finger? Wait, that creep's married? Married guys take their rings off all the time to go pick up women... especially in the city. It's, like, cultural. - Oh. - Want to call his wife? You stole his phone? How? - I'm crafty. - (Laughing) What? Call home. Oh, no no no. No no. Whitney... - I don't think you should... - Shh. Hello? Hi, is this Kevin's wife? Oh, my... Yes, it's his phone. Chill. I'm only borrowing it. I just met your hubby out at a club and he is a charmer. He invited my friend to spend the night at a hotel. Wait, so what was the name of the hotel? Whitney, don't. Come on. The St. Regis. Anyway, we just wanted to check with you since we assumed you might not be cool with that. Yeah. That's what we thought you'd say. So what's next? Next? Wow. You are insatiable, Masterson. Come on. Let's go skip stones again. Don't you want a rematch? Obviously, but I also have to be a gentleman. Can't keep you out too late. I am dating the chief of police's daughter. Gotta watch my step. So we're dating now? I mean... if one date counts as dating. I think it's two dates minimum. Okay. Friday night. You're on. Come on. Let's get you home. So he did it out-of-state. Franklin lakes, New Jersey... To Susan and Clyde Baxter. It's only an hour drive. We can't just show up there. I know it's crazy. I just... I really need to see them. Talk to them in person. I won't be pushy about meeting her. I just need to know she's okay. Just wait till tomorrow morning, and call them then. No. I can't sleep on this. Tess, come on. If you wait, I promise I'll go with you, help you. I've held all this in for years. I'm not waiting another minute. (Door closes) (Cellphone ringing) Hello. Eddie, what have you got for me? (Door opens) Hey. I was just about to call you. How are you? When you quit working for Vikram, you never saw him again, right? Karen, what's wrong? Why are you talking to me like this? I mean, that's what you told me, so is that right? What happened? What's wrong? What's wrong is you're not answering my question. Okay, yes. I did, I... I did talk to him. I went to see him. But just once, only once. Why does it matter? Vikram's dead. He's gone. We're better off for it. It's not about him. How could you keep something like that from me? He was cheating on you. Okay? I found out. So I went, I confronted him. It got heated. And... and I told him... about us. I didn't mean to. It just happened. I wasn't over you. It was years later, and I was still in love with you. We argued and I left, okay? When did this happen? I don't know. Six months ago, maybe. Oh, around the time that he disappeared off his boat? No, it had nothing to do with that. - Karen, I would never... - You tried to kill him. Didn't you? You attacked him on his boat. Calm down, okay? Don't tell me to calm down! Well, listen to what you're saying. How could you think I'm capable of something like this, Karen? Well, you're capable of moving his body. What? What are you talking about? Jack, stop playing games with me. You moved his body, and you made it look like an accident. I know you did this to protect me and Danny. But if you tried to kill Vikram on that boat, I need to know. Get out, Karen. Get out, Karen! (Door opens, closes) (Slamming) (Sighs) You know what? I'm wiped. Maybe we should skip the movie. Uh... Oh, okay. I'm sorry. I have that early student council meeting tomorrow morning, and... Are you gonna break up with me? What? No. Rico, why would you... I don't know, you've been acting really weird tonight and at first I thought it was presidential stuff, but now it seems like it's about me. No. It's not you at all. I really like you, but if you're losing interest just tell me. I'm a virgin. Wait, what? Virgin. V-i-r-g... Yeah, I know how to spell it. Um... oh, God! You think I want... Yeah, sex. The romantic night out, the movie, the food trucks. Food trucks means sex? No, but coming back to your place, it just feels so... I really like you, Rico, but I'm just not ready. Yeah, o... okay. It's okay. I mean, I don't want to have sex with you. You don't? (Stammers) Well, no, not like... I mean, I do, um, a lot. But not yet. Not until we're both ready. I mean, I'm a virgin too. A big one. You are? Yeah. It's, uh, shocking, I know. But... but yes. Now can we just drop all the sex talk? You want to watch a movie? Yes. Yes. (Chuckles) Oh, I've seen "Star Wars" like 100 times, but every time is like the first time. (Stammers) I mean, you know what I mean. Yeah. I do. (Pounding on door) Come in. Chief. Is something wrong? You could say that. You should be more careful. Stealing is what got you locked up in the first place. Or at least, that's the story, right? With you who knows what's real? What do you want, Danny? I want to know why you're here, Charlie. Really. You said it was a nice place. That's not the reason. Now you've been screwing with me ever since you got here. And I know what you're doing with Jo. What? Hanging out with a pretty girl? (Chuckles) You know, I hate to break it to you, but I think she really likes me. Charlie, she doesn't know you. She'll figure you out. I'm gonna make sure of it. How? You gonna show her a photo? It is creepy. It's just a photo. If it was just a photo, then why did you come here? And why do you look so nervous? Don't. Don't mess with me. And don't mess with me and Jo, or... (Laughs) Or what, Charlie? (Sighs) You know what. I mean, murder? And this time, I don't think that you're gonna get off as a minor, so... leave me and Jo the hell alone, or I'm gonna go to the police and I'm gonna tell them everything that I know. Now who's threatening? So Kevin's not about to have the best night, huh? I almost feel bad for him. I feel bad for his wife. Getting a call like that? Come on, Whitney, you have to admit that was kind of brutal. Oh, please. I did that woman a huge favor. She could have gone on for years with that creep lying to her. Divorce is rough, but it's not always bad, you know? Was it hard for you when your parents split up? I guess. Honestly, I barely remember them married. Oh, I remember mine married. Oh. Sorry, I didn't even realize. Why did they split? One of them cheat? Sort of. It doesn't really matter why their marriage failed. And now every time I break up with someone, it's like it... it stings a little extra. Yeah. I have no clue why you dumped Danny, but I'm sure you had a good reason. (Sighs) Whatever. I'm over it, you know? Guys, they... (Sighs) Suck? And lie. They lie and keep secrets, and it's exhausting. You are preaching to the choir. I'm done. I'm totally... I'm totally freaking done. I'm just... (cellphone rings) Hi, dad. Yes, I'm with Lacey. We're totally bonding. You're where? Oh my God. Is my dad okay? He's fine. We actually haven't charged him with anything yet. We're just running some tests, and then we'll see. Whatever you arrested him for, he didn't do it. I swear. He's a great guy. He's the best guy. Can she see him? Not yet. I still need to talk to him, but he won't answer any of my questions without an attorney, so I just called a public defender. He's on his way. Public defender? Well, he doesn't have an attorney, so... Of course not. He's never done anything wrong. Whitney, it's gonna be okay. Why did you arrest him? Lacey, can you take her home? I'm not leaving until you tell me what he did. (Sighs) Hey. What's up? I'm not staying with family friends. I live at the stables. Oh. Okay. That's cool. Look, I came to Green Grove after juvie because Danny made it sound great. The town, and the people. And so I got a room at the stable and a part-time job to pay my way. And then I told everyone that I was staying with family friends, which is why I cut our date short because I really wanted to invite you back, but I felt that... I don't care where you live or why you're here. I'm just really glad you are. - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com -
