 - Rico: Jo might not! - We never wanted you to find out that way. Just get out, all of you. Our friendship means so much to me and I don't wanna risk that. But you can risk it for Lacey. Lacey and I... look, we're over. But you still have feelings for her. Goodbye, Danny. That was the first time that I did that. It's the first time that I've done anything. I'm totally in love with you. Rico. - Uhm... - Eddie: It's confirmed. Traces of blood and hair on the pipe match the victim.

 And Danny Desai's fingerprints are all over it. We have a warrant to arrest your son for the murder of Regina Crane. - Danny Desai has fled. - Vikram: Tess, what's wrong? It's time for you to come back, Vikram. - (Police radio chatter) - (People chattering) Kyle: Call Eastwick and see what's taking that chopper so long. Meanwhile, I want you to widen the perimeter. Start three blocks out then four. He can't have gone that far. And when you find him, bring him to me, not Marilyn Rossi. It's my case. I call the shots. - Roger that. - Go. Before sunup I want Desai in custody. (Sighs) - Tell me he's gonna be okay. - (Siren wailing) Wish I could guarantee that, Karen. Karen: You mentioned that woman that found the murder weapon. She's not with the police force, is she? An investigator brought in by the Mayor. Karen, I could tell by the way you looked at her you'd seen her before. I thought Vikram was cheating. I had him followed. Turns out it was business, not an affair. - What are you thinking? - What I've been thinking since I recently found an apartment in his name and several active bank accounts. Vikram's alive. (Stammers) How? I need to use your landline. (Doorbell chimes) (Distant siren) Lacey, hi. Come in. What's going on? There are police cars everywhere. They found evidence, a murder weapon. - Oh. - They were gonna arrest Danny, but he ran. - Have you seen him? - No. Wait, he ran? I don't have many details. I assumed that's why you were here... because you knew. Actually, I was here to see Chief Masterson... about something different, but... it may be related. I... - He's out on the search. Whole police force is. - (Phone ringing) Maybe that's him. Excuse me. (Scoffs) A murder weapon? I don't believe that for a second. His fingerprints were all over it and he ran, Lacey. Innocent people don't run. But I found some things out. A few days before she was killed, Regina got into a fight with someone in a black Mercedes, - and she was scratched and... - Good. You should take that to my dad and he's not here. - You're still angry. - I'm not angry. I'm just tired of it all. Okay. Tell your dad I stopped by and that it's important. - Please. - Mm-hmm. (Sighs) See you later, Jo. (Door opens) I'll tell her. Okay. Be safe. - (Beeps) - Your dad... he wants you... us... to stay close to the house. - Okay. - Look, they'll find him. I don't really care anymore. Now I see him for who he really is... he lies, he keeps secrets. I know, but you always supported him. Well, maybe I don't anymore. I just... my whole like would be so much better - if he had never been in it. - (Cellphone buzzes) - I hope that wasn't Danny. - No, it's a whole different mistake. (Sighs) - Jo. Don't freak out. - (Gasps) Oh my God. Danny. What are you doing here? I needed to see you. I heard some things... No. No, this is the last place that you should've come. Look, I know, okay? I hurt you. And it wasn't the first time, but... Jo, I'm being framed. - So give yourself up. Don't run. - I can't. I can't. Not yet. They have a murder weapon. They have your prints. It's fake. It's fake. It has to be fake. I just need a little bit of time - to figure this out. - Just stay away from me, Danny, okay? I don't think you understand. I heard my mom and your dad talking. This woman, the one who found the murder weapon... - she's connected to my father. - You're not getting it! - I don't care! - Jo, you're not listening. - They think my father's alive. - Just... (shouts) Mom! Jo, please. Mom, hurry, he's up here! (Rustling) (Theme music playing) - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com - Danny? (Mutters) Danny! Danny! Danny, wait. - You're not Danny. - (Siren approaching) - Uh, no. No, I'm not. - (Helicopter overhead) - But hey, I could be. - I... (Car door closes) Freeze! Hold it right there. No, it's not him. It's not Danny. - Dude, the hood. The hood. - (Police radio chatter) Guys, we need everybody inside. We've got this kid running around loose. You need to go home, both of you. Yes, sir. (Sighs) Look, I'm... I'm sorry about that. - Do I know you? - No, I'm Charlie McBride. I'm new in town. I start mid-term tomorrow at Green Grove High. What's up with this Danny guy? Umm, it's a long story, and I really don't have time to tell it. So I'll see you at school. Yeah. I look forward to it. (Siren blaring) - He was here? - Upstairs. He came in that window they used to use as kids. Jo, honey, what did he say? Why was he here? Hey, you gotta tell me everything, okay? Okay, he said that he heard some stuff at his house... you and his mom talking about his dad being alive... and needing time. I called for mom. I didn't know what else to do. It's okay, baby. You did the right thing. Okay, but if you hear anything or see him, you need to contact the police right away. Yes, of course. (Rock music playing) Yeah, they... they talked to me, too. They're talking to everyone, even the little people. (Sighs) Man, this Danny thing is getting out of control. I saw Jo. She wouldn't even talk to me about it. Interesting coincidence, since I don't want to talk about it, her or Danny either. - You and Jo are so close. - Yeah, like two peas in two pods in two different corners of the universe. If you don't mind me saying, you look like you've got a lot on your shoulders. I sorta do. - Thank you. - Look, if you're asking me... which I don't think you are... I'd say you kinda stomped on Jo's heart and she's not just gonna forgive you overnight. I know that. I do. But you can hope, right? I think the thing is Jo doesn't know what she wants. Well, I know what I want. Danny back... it's pretty obvious. No, I treated him poorly, and now he's in all this trouble. I just wanna help him. If only he'll come in from out of the cold. (Shivers) It's all very "Bourne Identity," isn't it, in a tragic teenage kind of way? - This is for the coffee. I'll see you later, Rico. - All right. Hmm, got yourself a new friend. Branching out. That Jo... Is amazingly complicated and out of my life, so if you could just never mention her again. Whatever. He heard us in the house? I don't understand how that's possible. I don't know. He just came into my room saying that his dad was alive and that he needed my help. - But instead of helping, you called for Tess. - Of course she did. - It was the right thing to do. - But now he's running again and we have no idea where! Jo, I'm sorry. I don't mean to take this out on you. - This is just such a mess. - We're gonna find him, Karen. - I've got every unit on it. - God! What was Danny thinking? Please! The reality is no one knows how Danny thinks! I'm just... tired of guessing. I'll go talk to her. Kyle, I'm sorry. I... I know you're doing everything you can. (Mouths) (Knocks) Must be hard, all this Danny business. I mean, yeah. I guess it started with Danny... and his lies. I don't know. It doesn't matter. I just feel... I just feel stupid. Your dad told you calling for us was the right thing to do. I don't even care about that. It's not about Danny. Then what is it? Talk to me. It's... (Sighs) it's nothing, mom, I just... can you just go? I just really wanna be by myself. Can you just... Okay. - (Sighs) - Mom? (Crying) I slept with Tyler. Oh, Jo. It was my first time and it was a mistake. It was with the wrong guy and for the wrong reasons and I just feel... I just feel so stupid. It's okay. I just feel stupid, mom. You're okay, honey. Look... (Sighs) We all do things we regret. We set ourselves up... to hurt, but hurt's not always a bad thing. It doesn't feel that way. It just hurts. But you won't feel like that forever. Other guys will come along one of them will be the right guy. When it is the right guy... In a beautiful way, you'll get that first time all over again. (Sobbing) Excuse me, Chief Masterson. Hey, Lacey, shouldn't you be in school? I was looking for you last night. Didn't Jo tell you? - A lot going on last night. - I know, it's just I found some things out. Regina had these nasty scratch marks on her arm, and she lied and said Phoebe did it, but it was someone else. And it all happened in a car outside of school. Whose car? Her car? Her mother's? A Mercedes with tinted windows and Connecticut plates. That's very interesting, Lacey. We're working on some other leads. Thank you for your concern. We kinda need you to forget about this, go to school - and let us handle it, okay? - But I... - Okay. - We'll handle it. - Marilyn's car? - Marilyn's car with her in it watching us, so when I ask you to double-check and verify any pertinent forensic reports concerning this murder weapon she unearthed, let's just pretend I'm giving you my lunch order. Pastrami on rye, extra pickles, coleslaw. - Got it. - Kyle: That's it. - (School bell rings) - (Kids chattering) A familiar face. Uh, the only familiar face. Lacey, right? Charlie, the guy in the park last night. Right. How's it going, Charlie? - Uh, you know. - You look a little lost. Well, lost and now found. Wow. Did lines like that work on girls in your last school? There weren't any girls like you at my last school. - Hey, so I have chem 212. - Mm-hmm. - I'm thinking upstairs maybe? - Yeah, use those stairs and it's the first door on your right. Hey, new guy. Bye, new guy. Hey, it was really great, you know, connecting with you and... Is something on your mind? - Well, no. Umm... - No? Well, yeah, actually yeah. Stippling. Stippling. It's how you paint with a sponge. Anyways, it's a two-man job, so it's... it could be a one man, one woman job. Two people. I need two people. I'd love to go to your place after school, Rico. And hey, maybe on the way you can tell me the real reason why you want me there. Hey. Hey. Okay, gotta go. Rico, wait. - About last night... - What about it? Did you leave something out? - No. You're pissed, right? - Pissed? No, I'm fine. I'm actually running late for class. Oh. I talked to your father this morning. I guess you didn't pass along my message. Danny came to my room last night. Your room? (Sighs) Did you at least tell him my suspicions? No, I called for my mother. What? Why? Because he's a killer on the run. What did he say? Did he admit something? Okay, he said that he heard something and that... that his father is alive. (Whispers) Mr. Desai is alive? Yeah, he overheard my dad and his mom talking and they all seem to think that he's out there. God. Jo, why did you turn him in? Because it was the right thing to do, Lacey. Because none of us should be involved in this. Okay. So what, you want him to get sent away again? No, I just want him to tell the truth. He is telling the truth. Believe what you want to believe. (School bell rings) As the search widens for fugitive Danny Desai, police still have no confirmed sightings of the young man. They are asking for the public's help in apprehending this murder suspect. - More on this case coming up. - (Clicks) Tess. I wasn't expecting you. Yeah, sorry for not calling. I... it doesn't seem possible. I mean, does it to you? What, that Vikram's alive? - And framing Danny. - (Sighs) I just thought... you might've had some sense he was alive. Not at all. And this idea that he's framing Danny... Vikram has his flaws and plenty of secrets, but he loved his son. And the hardest thing is that he didn't come to me. I just can't believe that... - What? - Well, no one else has known he's alive. He somehow managed to keep it a complete secret. I know. It's weird. I guess when Kyle finds him, we'll get your answers. Your answers, too. Okay, can we go a little faster please? I don't need my mom to see us. What, she doesn't approve of stippling? Uh, it's not exactly her thing, or mine either, which I think you already figured out. Okay. Danny. Oh my God, you're okay. I needed to see you. Remember our deal... 24 hours, not a second longer, which gives you roughly... I don't... I... 17 hours, 36 minutes, 11 seconds. - Got it. - Like... okay. - (Sighs) - Rico. Really? Didn't have another choice. You know the way into my bedroom, too. I know, I just... we weren't exactly in the greatest place, either. I know and I'm sorry. I was caught up in what my friends think. Lacey, Lacey, it... it doesn't matter. It does, to me. You hear they think my father's alive? Yeah yeah, Jo told me. I need to find him, Lacey. I'll help you... any way I can. You know that. Jack: Hello, Karen. I have a problem, Jack. Must be a pretty big one for you to come here after all this time. I think Vikram might be alive. Oaky, that's big. But you're not surprised. Nothing Vikram did ever surprised me. Faking his own death would... well, it would seem right in line. No, I haven't seen him. No, I don't know where he is. - Why would I? - Because you were more than an employee. You were a trusted friend. I quit that job a while ago. You know that. And you know why. - Yes, I know why. - Good. I need your help. Can't do it, Karen. I'm turning you down. There's a switch, huh? I know it's insane to ask, but Danny's out there on the run, - being framed and if Vikram is alive... - (Slams) I said I can't. I got myself to think about now. I can't go back there. Okay. I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. Wait. I'll see what I can do. Eddie: I pulled all the paperwork on the murder weapon. - Nothing so far. - Keep digging. Is Marilyn still staying at the moss lake motel out by the interstate? - Pretty sure, why? - Go out there and tell her there's been a possible Desai sighting just south of the Eastside ferry. - That's a 30-minute drive. - Unless you drive the speed limit, and then it's 45. (Door opens) Showtime. All right, once it gets dark, you gotta... you gotta keep these closed or turn the lamp off. Or both. (Mutters) All right. (Sighs) - What? - I just wanted to say thank you, Rico, for doing this. I really appreciate it. Yeah, sure. Great, man. You're okay, though, right? You're not... you're not freaking out? Oh no no no, I'm fine. I'm all right. Maybe just a little bit with each passing second, you know? Sure, in the beginning it was all kind of cool and dangerous and it was like, "wow, I'm actually doing this." I'm harboring a fugitive... "I'm sorry, an accused fugitive." And there was this adventure. And there was this rush. There was this insane rush. - At first. - At first, yeah yeah. And now? Now I'm starting to puddle. Yeah, well, it won't be much longer. I just gotta figure out a way to find my father. I don't get it, man. How can you hear all that pure, honest emotion from Jo and not just crumble? Those eyes or her little pout. (Chuckles) And the way she laughs, it's mellifluous. Okay, big word, sorry. Rico, I... I'm aware of how amazing Jo is and... it just... it just wouldn't work between us. Last night I saw how much I hurt her with the secrets and I just... I don't think that she'll be able to trust me. - And I get it. - Do you, man? When someone bares their soul like that puts it all out there and doesn't get anything back, it's... sure, at first, it's completely freeing and you're like the man... or, I'm sorry, the woman if we're talking about Jo. But when you find out it's not mutual... it sucks. (Garage door opening) Oh, dad's home. Okay, not a sound. - Appreciate this. - A warrant's a warrant. This is it. (Knocks) (Lock beeps) Thanks, I'll take it from here. - Thanks. - Woman: Of course. - Keep the change. - Jo: Lacey. Oh. Hi, Jo. Early dinner for my mom, my sister and me. - How are you doing? - I'm just looking for Rico. He always comes here after school. Mmm. I guess he had a change in plans. He never changes his plans. He's a little O.C.D. that way. Well, you know him better than I do. (Laughs) - Are you okay, Lacey? - Considering everything that's going on, I'm just... I'm trying to be nice. How about if I find him, I'll... find you? But I probably won't find him, so... (laughs) 'cause why would I find him? So I hope you find him. Let me... lemme know if you... I'll see you later. (Sighs) Of course I ran into Jo at the diner. She was looking for Rico, but I doubt she suspected anything, because... I was smooth, played it cool. (Laughs) The fries smell great. (Sighs) Danny, the cops are interviewing all of us, looking for you. Uh, is this Chief Masterson, or the investigator woman, Marilyn Rossi? Rossi mostly. I'm really hoping Chief Masterson is running with the stuff I gave him. I mean getting you off for Regina's murder gets you off for everything. And I feel like Regina's mother knows something. - Jo. - Yeah, I put it together. You know this is crazy, right, Danny? You might've mentioned that. And you know I could call my dad right now or Rico's mom. Yeah. I mean, you could. And you have, but you can't. Jo, I'm being framed. Marilyn used to work for my father. So you're saying your father is framing you for murder? Yes, we're both saying it. How can you think that? How do you know? Because he did it before. I didn't my aunt. I've never killed anyone. (Stammers) No. No, we saw you with the jump rope. - You said you did it. - I lied. Five years in juvie? (Scoffs) Taking this abuse for something you didn't do? Danny, it just doesn't make sense. - She's right, it doesn't. - I couldn't say anything. There was too much at stake. I feel like there's a lot more at stake right now. I... I got home early that afternoon. You guys were already playing in the backyard. I remember how calm he was. Didn't even hesitate. He just bent down, he put the jump rope in my hand and he said I had to do it. That if the police found out, they were gonna take him away from me, from my mother, for the rest of my life. And you don't understand what it was like. I was scared. I was numb. And I loved him so much. I'd do anything for him. He was my father. He told me I was just a kid. They wouldn't put me in jail... a few months max, I'd be out. He just kept on saying, "please, please, please." - Lacey: Danny. - For him. For all of us, especially you. - I... - I don't understand. I didn't either. Something about my... my aunt Tara knowing secrets. Danny, a few months became five years. At first, he stopped visiting. And that hurt. And then he disappeared. And when I got out, I couldn't say anything. Because the one witness, my father, was apparently dead. And then Regina got murdered and somebody was framing me and I just couldn't figure out who. Until you heard your father was alive. Yeah, I kinda put it together. He made me take the blame for my aunt, and then he framed me for Regina. - Lacey: Oh my God, the police are here. - (People chattering) You don't know where he is and you haven't heard anything. - No. - Okay, I'm gonna go help stall them. There's a window in the bathroom. Help him get out of here, Jo. You need to go downstairs and turn yourself in right now. - I can't. - Danny, my dad'll believe you. He might, but other people, they're gonna need proof. I need to find him. How is that even possible? I have an idea... but I need your help. It was close to 100,000 cash. A lot of money to pay an investigator. Take a look. Vikram's dummy account... eight withdrawals adding up to 100,000. Same account that the money to pay Regina came from. So Vikram was being blackmailed by Regina. And this money, the 100,000... it was compensation for something a whole lot bigger. And all roads lead to Marilyn. More like all roads lead to Vikram. Vikram, it's me again. Why aren't you picking up? You said you were gonna come forward. You have to and soon. I just don't know how much longer I can keep quiet. Please. At least call me back. I want a full report of all places searched and places left to search. Marilyn: Tomorrow? Try yesterday. Miss Rossi. I'm Jo Masterson. I know who you are. I know where Danny is. - Go on. - Well... He wants to give himself up. Then he should. He wants to see his father first. His father is dead. Well, Danny doesn't believe that. He thinks that... he thinks that you work for his father and that you'll arrange a meeting between them. I could also just arrest him. He'll take that chance. Checked out all his old haunts. Places I knew about and places I heard about... addresses, boats, a storage locker down at the wharf. No one's seen him, Karen. Are you sure there's really a chance he's still alive? I wouldn't have come to you if there wasn't. Hmm. You know, I... I get Danny. Do you really care about Vikram? Of course. I care. He's my husband. He was your husband when we were... together. That was a long time ago... years and years and years... and... we both moved on with our lives. Or tried. (Sighs) What's that? Just some junk from a storage locker of his... paper, legal stuff. A lot of water damage, I think. He's not in the box, Karen. I checked. We have to get this to the police. - You must be exhausted. - Has Eddie called? No. What's going on? I told him to call only on the home line. - Where's Jo? - She texted. She's studying with Rico. Vikram alive is just so unthinkable. - (Phone ringing) - Sometimes unthinkable is good thinking. - (Beeps) - Hello? Good work, Eddie. I'll meet you there. What's going on? Evidence that the lab results were tampered with. Danny's prints are not on that murder weapon. (Door opens, closes) â™ª Goodbye, our window of mercy... â™ª Hi, big guy. Charlie: He likes you. - You again. - (Both laugh) Yeah, the family I'm staying with, they're big on me earning my keep. You know, that whole thing about idle hands. - This guy yours? - Half mine. Regina and I shared him. Regina? That's the girl this Danny guy is accused of... But didn't. That's how they made it sound on the news. (Sighs) I was looking for Regina's mother. I called her house and they said she was here. Yeah yeah, you just missed her by about a half hour. Oh. What you wanna talk to her about? Well, she's not here, so I'd better get going. Listen, if there's anything I can do, you know, maybe mention that you were here or... Yeah, fine. That'd be great. Thanks. Ah. Are you up here on the wall of fame and shame? (Chuckles) In a couple places. Mmm. Crane lady's all over it, huh? Yeah, her family grew up on horses. That's Gloria and Regina right there. And that's me and Regina. God. I'd forgotten Danny's father was a big rider, too. That's him with Gloria. That's funny. I assumed that was her husband. No. Just friends. (Door creaking) Jo, what are you doing here? I don't know which way she's gonna go... the police or Vikram. I'm just... I'm scared for you. I don't know what's gonna happen. I'm done running, Jo. One way or another, it ends tonight. Well, then I'll stay, too. I won't go. No, you can't. Come on. - Danny, I can't... - You don't understand, Jo. (Door creaking) Hello, son. That was smart, going to Marilyn. She's been helping me find you. Find me or frame me? Danny, you don't understand. - You're right, I don't. - I had to stay dead. People were trying to kill me. They still are. I don't care, okay?! You're lying, like you lie about everything! Jo, look at me. I need you to go, okay? I'm not going anywhere. (Gasps) She knows. I told her... how I took the jump rope, how I took the blame. When you're a kid, you get it. You understand this man, your father, explains it to you. And he's this amazing man. And you love him and you look up to him. - I'm back now, son. - No. We can go away, together. We'll disappear, start our lives over. And you want that for him, right, Jo? No. No. Don't you talk to her! I'm not running away! I've been hiding for five years behind a lie! And when I got out of juvie and you were supposed to be dead, all I wanted was a second chance. And now I'm running from the police, I'm being framed, and it's you, dad. It's you. Just admit it. Everything I did is for a good reason. - Our lives were at stake. - Whose lives? What lives?! Vikram: Everyone who's close to you, Danny! Now you need to listen to me now! I am your father! - You will destroy everything! - Danny: No! No! I'm just gonna ruin you. You need to pay for what you did to me. And you need to keep your mouth shut! (Beeps) No, Jo, don't... Danny, get off me, damn it! Give me that phone! (Police radio chatter) Manager says she hasn't checked out. Let's go. Police, open up! Clear. She's gone. (Rustles) (Yelps, gasps) (Panting) You little bitch! - Don't touch her! - Danny, get off! You know, this is all your fault. (Both grunt) (Thuds) - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com -
