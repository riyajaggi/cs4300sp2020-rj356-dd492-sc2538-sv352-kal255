 Twisted (2013–2014): Season 1, Episode 6 - Three for the Road - full transcript 
 Danny, Jo and Lacey go on a road trip in Lacey's car to find out more about the person who sent Regina the threatening letter. During the way, Jo and Lacey get into a fight, and they are forced to deal with the past. The long trip also seems wasted when the security guard of the building the person sent the letter from refuses to let them inside and threatens to call the police if they try anything. Meanwhile, Chief Masterson senses that Rico holds valuable information in the murder case, and Karen and Tess start to reconnect.

  Narrator:  PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"... VIK'S DEATH HAS BEEN ESPECIALLY HARD ON DANNY. DON'T YOU THINK THAT THE PERSON WHO GAVE REGINA THE NECKLACE - MIGHT BE CONNECTED--  - JUST STOP IT, JO. THIS ISN'T A GAME. WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE LINK BETWEEN REGINA AND TARA. THAT NECKLACE IS STILL THE BEST LEAD WE HAVE. Rico:  WHY DO YOU TRUST HIM?  HE LIED TO US, LIKE, A LOT. Danny:  THIS WAS SENT TO REGINA?  WHEN? Lacey: IT WAS POSTMARKED TWO DAYS BEFORE SHE DIED. - WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS  TO THE POLICE.  - NO, I CAN'T.

 LACEY, I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT. I KNOW YOU BLAME DANNY FOR EVERYTHING. BUT HIM COMING BACK HERE, IT'S BEEN GOOD FOR HER. MY GOD, TESS,  YOU'RE BEING CHARMED  BY A FREAKIN' PSYCHOPATH. WHAT'S GOING ON? LACEY FOUND SOMETHING. ( chattering ) Danny:  YOU STILL CAN'T THINK  OF ANYONE? NO, REGINA NEVER TALKED  ABOUT ANYONE WHO WOULD  SEND SOMETHING LIKE THIS. CERTAINLY NO ONE  FROM A RANDOM APARTMENT  BUILDING IN CONNECTICUT. I THOUGHT YOU SAID SHE DATED A GUY IN CONNECTICUT LAST YEAR. I KNOW, I WENT THROUGH  ALL MY OLD TEXTS WITH HER, AND SHE NEVER SAID  ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT HIM.

 HE WAS JUST  HER CONNECTICUT BOY TOY. WHAT ABOUT YOUR OTHER FRIENDS? WOULD THEY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BOY TOY? TRUST ME,  IF REGINA DIDN'T TELL ME,  SHE DIDN'T TELL ANYONE. BESIDES, I CAN'T TALK  TO MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS. - RIGHT, JUST US.  - YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. WELL, SILVER LINING-- WE NOW HAVE TWO GRAND IN HUNDREDS. ( phone beeping ) I'M SORRY, LACEY,  ARE WE BORING YOU? I'M TEXTING  MY BOYFRIEND BACK, JO.  IS THAT OKAY? 'KAY, YOU WERE THE ONE  WHO INSISTED ON MEETING HERE. AND YOU BROUGHT  ALL OF THIS TO US. - I BROUGHT IT TO DANNY.  - OKAY, DON'T TURN  ON EACH OTHER. THEN THE CONFUSING BLACKMAIL NOTE WINS. I STILL THINK WE SHOULD  JUST TELL MY DAD ABOUT IT. WHAT IF PEOPLE FOUND OUT?  HER FRIENDS, HER MOM. HOW WOULD THEY FEEL  IF THEY KNEW REGINA  WAS INVOLVED IN... I DON'T WANT TO TELL ANYONE  UNTIL WE KNOW EXACTLY  WHAT'S GOING ON. DANNY'S LIFE IS AT STAKE HERE. I'M SORRY. LET ME JUST THINK  MORE ABOUT ALL OF THIS AND THEN WE'LL REGROUP. I HAVE TO GO MEET  WITH PHOEBE AND SARITA. TELL 'EM I SAY HI. CAN YOU GIVE HER A CHANCE? SHE'S MORE ONBOARD  THAN SHE WAS BEFORE. IT'S PROGRESS, RIGHT? SHE'LL NEVER BE TOTALLY ONBOARD. ( door opens ) Karen:  DANNY, CAN YOU HELP ME  WITH THE GROCERIES, PLEASE? ( door closes ) MOTHER? WHERE IS IT? IT'S GONE. I GOT RID OF IT. I NEEDED THAT NECKLACE. WHY? HUH? WHY DID YOU HAVE IT? AND WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME ABOUT IT? IT WAS IN MY LOCKER, OKAY? THE DAY AFTER REGINA DIED,  SOMEONE JUST LEFT IT THERE  FOR ME. WHOEVER KILLED HER  MUST HAVE KNOWN THAT THAT NECKLACE  BELONGED TO AUNT TARA. THEY KNEW THAT IT  WOULD MAKE ME LOOK GUILTY. YOU THINK THIS MEANS  THAT I KILLED REGINA,  DON'T YOU? I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU WOULDN'T GET RID OF IT. I TRIED,  BUT IT WAS ALL I HAD. I THOUGHT THAT  IF I COULD FIND THE KILLER AND PLANT THE NECKLACE  BACK ON THEM, THAT MAYBE I'D BE ABLE  TO CLEAR MY NAME. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE  TO DO. WELL, THE NECKLACE IS GONE NOW. IF YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, THEN THE POLICE WILL FIGURE IT OUT. "IF." THERE IT IS. "IF." ( theme music playing ) JO, WHAT THE HELL?  THE CIVIL WAR WAS  JUST ABOUT TO START. RICO, ENOUGH. YOU'VE BEEN AVOIDING ME SINCE FALL FEST. ARE YOU MAD AT ME OR SOMETHING? NO, IT WAS JUST  KIND OF A WEIRD NIGHT. WEIRD HOW? BECAUSE OF DANNY. I DON'T KNOW, SORT OF. CAN WE JUST FORGET  ABOUT THE WHOLE THING? OKAY, LOOK. I GET THAT YOU DON'T TRUST HIM, AND THAT'S-- I MEAN, THAT SUCKS. BUT I JUST WANT ANYTHING TO GET BETWEEN YOU AND I. AND ME. ME IS THE OBJECT  OF THE PREPOSITION  "BETWEEN," SO... - OKAY, I HATE YOU, SO...  - ( laughs ) SO NOW WHAT?  JUST YOU AND DANNY TRYING TO CLEAR HIS NAME  TOGETHER? JUST THE TWO OF YOU  ON THE CASE? - WHY ARE YOU BEING WEIRD?  - NO REASON. I JUST SAW THE WAY  YOU WERE LOOKING AT HIM  AT FALL FEST. DANNY IS MY... HE'S JUST A FRIEND. YEAH, A FRIEND YOU WANT  TO MATE WITH. MATE? DO I LOOK LIKE A ZEBRA? NO, BUT YOU LOOK  LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS A CRUSH. I'M JUST HELPING HIM PROVE HE DIDN'T KILL REGINA. AND WE MAY HAVE FOUND SOMETHING THAT COULD PROVE IT. WAIT, WHAT DID YOU GUYS FIND? I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT THAT ANYMORE. JO, LET'S SAY  SOMEONE FINDS SOMETHING  OR SEES SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T  CLEAR HIS NAME,  OR UNCLEARS IT WORSE, OR MAKES IT LESS CLEAR... OKAY, IF YOU'RE ASKING ME HOW I'D REACT IF DANNY DID IT, I MEAN, I'D BE DEVASTATED. BUT TRUST ME, BASED ON WHAT WE KNOW NOW, SOMEONE ELSE KILLED REGINA. - HEY, LACEY,  ANY NEW INFO?  - NO, NOT YET. JO'S RIGHT.  WE SHOULD EITHER  GO TO THE POLICE WITH THE CASH AND THE NOTE,  OR, I DON'T KNOW,  DO SOMETHING NOW. WHAT IF WE WENT THERE?  WHAT IF WE WENT TO THAT ADDRESS  IN CONNECTICUT? GREAT IDEA. LET'S KNOCK ON THE DOOR AND ASK WHY THEY SENT THAT NOTE. OH, WHILE WE'RE THERE, LET'S ASK IF THEY MURDERED REGINA AND TOOK HER NECKLACE. WELL, AT LEAST WE'LL  FIND OUT WHO LIVES THERE. WHAT? YOU'RE AFRAID  SOMETHING ELSE MIGHT HAPPEN? DANNY, I ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT KISS WAS A MISTAKE. I HAVE A BOYFRIEND. YEAH, I'M VERY AWARE  OF THAT, LACEY. FINE, I'LL PICK YOU UP AT 8:00. OKAY, GREAT,  I'LL BRING SNACKS. BRING SNACKS WHERE? ME AND LACEY  ARE THINKING ABOUT GOING  ON A LITTLE ROAD TRIP TONIGHT. ROAD TRIP TO WHERE? TO THAT APARTMENT  IN CONNECTICUT? - WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO COME. - DIDN'T SAY THAT I WANTED TO. PLUS MY DAD  WOULD NEVER LET ME. HE'S BEEN SUPER TENSE  TOWARD ME SINCE FALL FEST. I GOTTA GO. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. HEY, YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY  WITH ALL THIS-- NOT GOING? YEAH, OF COURSE. I MEAN, I'M REALLY JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU. IF YOU LEAVE THE STATE, AREN'T YOU VIOLATING YOUR PROBATION? DON'T WORRY.  IT'LL BE FINE. ( phone vibrating ) I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE STATION TONIGHT. OKAY. MIGHT BE LATE AGAIN. I HAVE A LOT OF PAPERWORK TO CATCH UP ON. I BET. HEY, I'M HEADING TO THE DINER TO MEET RICO. I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER. - OKAY, DON'T BE LATE.  - HOLD UP, THE DINER? YEAH, RICO'S THERE NOW.  HE'S WAITING FOR ME. - SO GOTTA RUN.  - UH-HUH.

I'M SORRY. DIDN'T I TELL YOU? - I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT  TO GO KILL SOMEONE.  - ( sighs ) LACEY'S PICKING ME UP. WE'RE GOING FOR A DRIVE. THAT'S GREAT. YEAH. DANNY? COME ON.  I WAS JUST TRYING  TO HELP YOU. HAVE A NICE NIGHT. YEAH, MOM,  I'LL HAVE THE CAR BACK  BY 11:00, I PROMISE. OKAY, BYE. ( phone beeps ) - ( sighs )  - EVERYTHING OKAY?

HE'LL BE FINE. BUT HEY, IF I'M CROWDING YOU... IT'S FINE, JO. I'M GLAD, LACEY. ( car starts ) OH, KAREN. HEY, COME IN. SORRY TO JUST DROP IN  LIKE THIS. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? NO, ACTUALLY. JO TOOK OFF TONIGHT  WITHOUT TELLING US. RICO ISN'T ANSWERING EITHER. KYLE. UH, SO DANNY TOLD ME  THAT HE SIGNED UP FOR  YOUR POTTERY CLASS AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE  THAT YOU GOT PAID. THANK YOU, KAREN. WOULD YOU EXCUSE US? WE'RE HAVING A SMALL FAMILY CRISIS. TESS TOLD ME. AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT JO IS WITH DANNY AND LACEY. THEY WENT DRIVING OFF SOMEWHERE. I SERIOUSLY DOUBT  JO'S WITH THEM. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO TRACK DOWN OUR DAUGHTER  WHY DON'T YOU STAY HERE AND ASSUME SHE'S PERFECT  AND NEVER LIES? I'M SORRY IF I WANT TO GIVE HER THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. I'M SORRY IF I DON'T. Jo:  MAYBE SHE WAS  BLACKMAILING SOMEONE. BLACKMAILING?  REGINA WOULD NEVER DO THAT. IT'S JUST A THEORY. MUSIC ANYONE?

I REMEMBER 'CAUSE  I GOT CREAMED EVERY TIME  WE CRASHED INTO THE SNOW BANK. GOD, I BASICALLY HAD, LIKE,  HYPOTHERMIA WHEN WE GOT BACK. HYPOTHERMIA, RIGHT.

UNLESS SHE SAID  WE HAD PLANS TO STUDY TONIGHT, IN WHICH CASE,  JO IS LATE. DARN HER. WHY ARE YOU  SO WORRIED ABOUT HER?

OH, BECAUSE WE WERE FIGHTING. I DON'T GET IT. HEY, NO NO NO NO NO NO. WE'RE ALL FINALLY  ON THE SAME PAGE HERE AND YOU GUYS ARE BITING  EACH OTHER'S HEADS OFF.  JO, WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

WHERE DO YOU KEEP IT? SHALL WE? CAN I HELP YOU GUYS? THIS CAME TO US  FROM APARTMENT 413, BUT THERE WAS NO NAME  ON THE RETURN ADDRESS. WHO LIVES THERE? 413? REALLY? ANY WAY WE CAN JUST GO UP AND SEE WHOEVER LIVES THERE, - TALK WITH HIM FOR A SECOND?  - OR HER. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF GAME YOU KIDS ARE PLAYING, BUT I'M NOT IN THE MOOD TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT? NOW GO ON. GREAT PLAN, JO.  HOLDING UP THE ENVELOPE  REALLY WORKED. LIKE YOURS WOULD HAVE BEEN  ANY BETTER-- JUST WALK IN,  ACT LIKE WE LIVE THERE. I GUESS WE'LL NEVER KNOW, WILL WE? AS MUCH AS I'M ENJOYING  THIS LITTLE WITTY REPARTEE, I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HELP US FIGURE OUT WHO LIVES  IN THAT APARTMENT. GOD, THIS TRIP  WAS SUCH A STUPID IDEA. - YEAH, WELL,  YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME.  - OKAY, JUST-- WOW, NOT WANTING  TO INVITE ME ALONG--  WHAT A LACEY PORTER ORIGINAL. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? YOU WANT TO HEAR  ABOUT MIDDLE SCHOOL? NO, I--  I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK I-- AMBER KLEIN'S  13th BIRTHDAY PARTY. DOES THAT RING ANY BELLS  FOR YOU, LACEY? WELL, I WAS THE ONLY PERSON  THAT WASN'T INVITED, WHICH NORMALLY  I WOULDN'T HAVE CARED, BUT WHEN THE ENTIRE CLASS  IS INVITED AND YOU AREN'T,  IT'S KIND OF SUSPICIOUS. RIGHT, LACEY? SO I CONFRONTED AMBER,  AND SHE SAID LACEY PORTER ASKED HER  NOT TO INVITE ME, SAID THAT I'D RUIN  THE ENTIRE PARTY. I'M SORRY, BUT YOU WERE SO DIFFICULT TO BE AROUND... AFTER WHAT HAPPENED. YOU MADE EVERYONE AROUND YOU MISERABLE, OKAY? I WAS TRAUMATIZED TOO, I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME. GOD, JO, I WAS 13. I JUST WANTED TO HAVE FUN. SO DID I.

NO WAY IN YET. WE NEED A PLAN. - HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?  - YEAH. I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID TO ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOU AND LACEY. I JUST-- I KNEW IT WAS CONNECTED TO WHAT I DID. LACEY MADE HER OWN CHOICES. YOU WEREN'T AFRAID  TO ASK HER. THAT NIGHT, YOUR--  YOUR SLEEPOVER. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I-- I SAID TO LACEY THAT NIGHT? I SAID, I DON'T KNOW IF I REGRET WHAT I DID FIVE YEARS AGO. BUT I-- I REGRET HURTING YOU TWO... RUINING YOUR FRIENDSHIP. AND I MEAN THAT, OKAY? I CARE ABOUT YOU GUYS SO MUCH. I CARE ABOUT YOU TOO. LACEY AND I--  WE BOTH CARE ABOUT YOU. - ( door opens )   - Guard: HEY! I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, BUT THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY.

BUT THAT RAID, THOUGH. DID YOU LOOK EVERYWHERE? LIKE MAYBE HIS MOM'S ROOM? YOU KNOW, I MEAN, COULDN'T SHE HAVE BEEN HIDING IT FOR HIM? I MEAN, SHE IS, YOU KNOW, HIS MOM. SHE MIGHT DO THAT.

HE THREATENED TO CALL THE POLICE. DO YOU REALLY WANT TO RISK THAT? WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT  WHO LIVES IN THAT APARTMENT,  JUST NOT TONIGHT. NO. I NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT. TONIGHT. LOOK, I KNOW  I CAN'T FORCE YOU TWO  TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN. OKAY? BUT I NEED YOU,  BOTH OF YOU. SO PLEASE, DON'T--  DON'T BAIL ON ME LIKE YOU TWO  BAILED ON EACH OTHER. ( door squeaking ) ( crunching ) - Kyle: HOW IS THAT?  - SALTY. RICO, WHY WERE YOU ASKING ME ALL THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT NECKLACE? WELL, I-- I TOLD YOU,  MYSTERY EXCITES ME. THERE'S NOTHING YOU'RE KEEPING FROM ME, IS THERE? RICO, LOOK AT ME. ( gulps ) I DON'T WANT TO HURT JO. HOW WOULD YOU HURT JO? IF WHAT I KNOW--  IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE REAL, SHE WOULD BE-- SHE CARES ABOUT HIM  SO MUCH. WHO, DANNY? WHAT IF JO GOT HURT? NOT HER FEELINGS,  BUT FOR REAL HURT--  PHYSICALLY HURT. WHAT IF THAT HAPPENED AND YOU COULD HAVE STOPPED IT BY TELLING ME WHAT YOU KNOW? I CARE ABOUT JO, RICO, MORE THAN ANYTHING  IN THE WHOLE WORLD. AND IF YOU CARE ABOUT HER TOO,  YOU'LL TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW. BECAUSE WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION IS A SERIOUS OFFENSE-- AN OFFENSE THAT COMES WITH ACTUAL JAIL TIME. I HAVE TO GO. ( clicking ) WHAT THE HELL  ARE YOU DOING UP HERE? HE SPENT FIVE YEARS IN JUVIE. I THINK HE CAN HANDLE HIMSELF. JO-- LACEY, LET'S NOT, OKAY?

I AM SORRY, THOUGH, FOR AMBER KLEIN'S  BIRTHDAY PARTY. IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL  ANY BETTER, THE PARTY WAS REALLY LAME. AMBER KLEIN IS LAME,  SO THAT'S NOT A SHOCKER. DO YOU THINK DANNY WAS RIGHT? WHAT?  THAT WE BAILED ON EACH OTHER? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT WE WENT THROUGH-- IT WAS-- IT WOULD HAVE PUT A STRAIN  ON ANY FRIENDSHIP. YEAH. AND MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY-- US DRIFTING APART. NOT ALL FRIENDSHIPS LAST FOREVER. WE SHOULD GO IN, SEE IF THAT SECURITY GUARD HAS SEEN HIM. HE MAY CALL THE COPS ON US. I KNOW. WE HAVE TO RISK IT. MAYBE HE HAD TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. - DO YOU THINK DANNY--  - GOT TO THE APARTMENT? - I DON'T KNOW.  - MAYBE HE FOUND  WHOEVER LIVES THERE. WHY HAS HE BEEN GONE FOR SO LONG? LET ME TEXT HIM AGAIN. - ( typing )   - HE'S NOT ANSWERING ME. JO, COME ON.  HE MIGHT COME BACK. I FOUND  A BUILDING DIRECTORY. OH MY GOD. THE DOOR WAS WEDGED OPEN  WITH ONE OF THOSE, UM-- - THE WEDGY THINGS,  LIKE, ON THE DOORS.  - I'M SORRY, BUT I'M REQUIRED TO REPORT  ALL UNAUTHORIZED ENTRANCE  TO THE COPS. SIR, UH... COME ON, I JUST EXPLAINED EVERYTHING. NOT WELL. I TOLD YOU THAT THE ENVELOPE, IT HAD A RETURN ADDRESS  ON IT, SO I WAS-- DO YOU THINK I'M DUMB? NO ONE'S LIVED  IN 413 FOR A WHILE.

YEAH, OF COURSE. HE'S HERE WITH ME NOW. - I'LL TALK TO YOU.  - Lacey: IT'S NOT POSSIBLE. - IT SEEMS PRETTY POSSIBLE.  THAT LIST--  - IS WRONG. HOW COULD VIKRAM HAVE SENT THAT CASH AND NOTE? HE'S DEAD. THEY NEVER FOUND A BODY. ( laughs ) THIS IS SO MESSED UP. YEAH, I KNOW. DID REGINA KNOW VIKRAM? NO. I MEAN, I DON'T THINK SHE DID. HOW DO YOU THINK DANNY WOULD REACT TO THIS? HE WAS SO CLOSE TO HIS DAD. ( phone vibrating ) IT'S DANNY. HE'S BEEN BUSTED BY SECURITY. THEY'RE CALLING THE COPS. ( knocking ) COME ON IN. HOW YOU FEELIN'? GROSS. I'M NEVER DOING THAT AGAIN. YEAH, ME NEITHER. OKAY, MAYBE I WILL. LISTEN, I, UH-- I KNOW, TESS. IT'S-- IT'S OKAY. I OVERREACTED. YOU KNOW? IT HIT A NERVE. VIKRAM AND I-- WELL, LET'S JUST SAY WE DIDN'T HAVE THE PERFECT MARRIAGE. DOESN'T MEAN  YOU DON'T MISS HIM. YEAH. I BET YOU DO TOO. HE WAS ONE OF A KIND. DEFINITELY. AND DANNY WORSHIPPED HIM. KAREN, HAVE YOU FOCUSED  ON ANYTHING BUT DANNY  SINCE HE GOT BACK? LIKE WHAT? I HAVE NOTHING TO DO, I DON'T HAVE ANY REAL HOBBIES, AND I HAVEN'T HAD A JOB IN YEARS. WELL, MAYBE IT'S TIME  YOU GET ONE. A HOBBY,  OR EVEN A JOB. SO, WANT TO FINISH  MAKING YOUR VASE? SURE. HOW'S IT LOOKING? IT'S, UH--  IT'S INTERESTING. IT SUCKS, DOESN'T IT? IT'S NOT GREAT. SO DID YOU ALWAYS KNOW YOU WANTED TO BE A SECURITY GUARD IN AN APARTMENT IN CONNECTICUT OR-- ( footsteps approach ) - THERE YOU ARE.  - WE WERE SO WORRIED. - WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU--  - SIR, WE'RE SORRY. WE CAN EXPLAIN. REMEMBER WHEN WE SAID WE GOT A LETTER FROM APARTMENT 413? THAT WAS A LIE TO GET IN THE BUILDING. OUR FRIEND, HE'S IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN THAT LIVES HERE. - ANGELA PECK. DO YOU KNOW HER? - ANGELA PECK? SHE LIVES IN 431,  NOT 413. - OH!  - 431! YOU GOT THE APARTMENT WRONG. SHOOT, I INVERTED  THE NUMBERS AGAIN. - HE ALWAYS DOES THAT.  - YOU LOVE-SICK MORON. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME ANY OF THIS? BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,  I WAS EMBARRASSED. A-- ANGELA, YOU KNOW, WON'T SEE ME.  SHE WON'T TAKE MY CALLS. - SHE WON'T EVEN TELL ME WHY.  - PROBABLY BECAUSE  SHE'S MARRIED. I KNOW.  BUT HER HUSBAND, YOU KNOW? HE DOESN'T GET HER LIKE I DO. WEREN'T YOU EVER  A TEEN WITH A CRUSH? SURE, BUT NOT ON A WOMAN  WITH FOUR KIDS. OKAY, I'M GONNA CALL  MRS. PECK TO CONFIRM ALL THIS. IT'S LATE. WON'T SHE BE ASLEEP? AND HER KIDS. GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. AND LEAVE POOR ANGELA  AND HER FAMILY ALONE. ( door opens, closes ) AHEM. I DO WANT  TO PROTECT JO, EVEN IF WHAT I TELL YOU  ENDS UP HURTING HER. OKAY. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME? ( sighs ) UM, THE NIGHT OF FALL FEST, I WALKED HOME  THROUGH McNALLY PARK AND I SAW SOMETHING ODD. UM, IT WAS DANNY'S MOM. SHE LOOKED SO SAD  AND CONFUSED. AND THEN I SAW HER  THROW SOMETHING INTO THE WATER. NOW IT WAS DARK  AND I COULDN'T SEE VERY WELL, BUT THIS THING--  IT GLINTED AS IT FELL. AND I THINK IT MIGHT  HAVE BEEN A NECKLACE. SO HE SAID THAT GUY  IN THE APARTMENT HAS BEEN DEAD  FOR MONTHS? APPARENTLY. THE APARTMENT WAS JUST SITTING THERE VACANT. IT'S WEIRD, HUH? YEAH. I JUST DON'T GET IT. WHO COULD HAVE SENT THAT LETTER TO REGINA FROM AN ADDRESS  THAT NO ONE LIVES? I HAVE NO IDEA. ( laughs ) I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALMOST WENT BACK TO JUVIE TONIGHT. FOR WHAT? FOR NOTHING. WE DIDN'T FIGURE OUT ONE FRIGGIN' THING. I KNOW. TOTALLY SUCKS. ( slow music playing )
