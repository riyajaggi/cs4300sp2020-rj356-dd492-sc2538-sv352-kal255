  - Previously on "twisted"...   - What's it like? Being around danny  all the time again? - It's extremely different.  - ( both chuckle ) She got it sometime  last spring. Know where? Who gave it to her? Does it have something to do  with what happened to her? What do you want from me, danny? I just want... That reminds me  of what I did.  - Including tara's necklace?  - What necklace? Anything in the bedroom?  Okay, let's go.

 I know what he was looking for. When regina died, she was wearing My aunt tara's necklace. Why didn't you  tell us that?! I guess we have to  figure out How regina got  that necklace. ( gasps ) I thought you hated  peanut butter. That's because it makes you pudgy. Not my problem anymore. Wow, are you seriously  judging a dead person  right now? No, you're just eating it  so quickly. - Take a breath.  - Can't. God's a vegan. He's weird about processed food.

 If he found out about this,  he'd kill me. A line like that  would kill in heaven. Ha! I just said "kill" again. Heaven, huh? Well-played. Well... I had to lie about how many people I've slept with. They only allow two. So, Tell me about stuff.  Catch me up. What's going on with you? Nothing. ¶ someone's got a secret - ¶ and her name is lacey.  - ( chuckles ) Spill it, bitch. Is it about danny? You wanna hit that, don't you? What? No, I don't. I don't blame you. That long hair... The menacing eyes, The strong, murderous hands. When danny killed me, he was smiling. It was creepy at the time. But now... Hot. Where did you get that? This thing? I don't know. Why? You think it's a clue? No, it's none of my business. You think danny took this from me, don't you? Regina, please just stop it. You think he took it from me when he killed me. You think he yanked it from my cold, dead... - Neck.  - ( gasps, pants ) Sources have confirmed that  a search warrant served at  the desai residence... Hold on, mom.  I think dad's about  to get a shout-out. The regina crane murder  remains unsolved, Putting the town of green grove  increasingly on edge Heading into its famous  annual fall festival-- ( tv turns off ) Hey, unsolved.  That's me. Well, festival's certainly  getting a publicity bump. Maybe I'll even get a few  out-of-towners signing up  for my pottery class. You don't need any extra publicity. Awesome enough to get you  to check out the festival  this year? It's not my thing. You and I would put together  the most elaborate outfits Those big dresses with  those fancy pink bows. Yeah, well, I'm not 10 anymore, mom. I'm aware of that, sweetie. I'm sorry. It's just... That tradition is kind of dated, you know? Fair enough. Let's just hope  for everyone's sake That danny shares  your attitude. Why? Your raid didn't find any evidence against him. Not even the necklace. Necklace? What necklace? You wanna tell her? Regina crane was wearing tara desai's necklace... When she died. Is that all danny told you? And it was missing... From regina. Why would danny kill regina  and then take the one thing - That would make  him look guilty?  - Good question. Did danny explain  to you what the deal  is with this necklace? It was a family heirloom. Anyway, aren't you more interested in who gave regina the necklace? We're looking at this from every possible angle. I have to get to school, so-- Okay, have a nice walk. ( door closes ) Regina had  tara's necklace? Who do you think  gave it to her? What, are you gonna tell me danny's innocent too? - I don't know what to think. - Well, that seems pretty clear. Maybe we should start presenting a more united front. ( door opens ) ( door closes ) Man on tv: I think the town should ban him. Fall fest is a cherished tradition. It's a family event. And the last thing we need is a killer coming and freaking everyone out. Wow, tell us how you really feel, tim calvert, Local resident. - ( sighs )  - ( remote clicks ) You want some cereal? Uh, yeah yeah. I'll ma-- I'll make it. You, uh, thinking of going? ( chuckles )  to the, uh... Fall fest?  I don't know. You? Ooh, after that  charity brunch? I think I need a little  break from the town. ( exhales ) Maybe you need a break too. Well, not according  to dr. Reidy. She wants me to connect  with meaningful events  from my past. It might help  with my "transition." So I decided to donate some of your dad's things to goodwill. Someone's coming this morning to pick them up. It's not a bad idea. Some of his old clothes, suits and ties, The big chair in the den. The chair? That a problem? Kinda. Yeah, actually. Maybe it's too soon... Get rid of dad's stuff--  I like having it around. It makes me  feel like, uh, He's still here. Okay. We can wait. Thanks. ( theme music playing ) Come on, you're the one who talked me into joining the stupid mathletes. What? So now I'm required  to help you sell pies  at fall fest? You-- you get it, right? It's like the symbol pi. You mathletes sure  know how to pun. Okay, well, one of these years, I'm gonna drag you to this festival. My town spirit  isn't exactly at  an all-time high. Is it because of  the danny stuff? I guess I just wish  more people would Give him a chance,  you know? Yeah, but you get why people  are still freaked, right? ( stammering )  I'm not saying  they have a right to be. No, I know. People can think whatever they want. Fall fest used to be fun, But I don't know... Maybe I'm just not A town community kinda girl anymore. My social studies teacher  mr. Jasper says that All human beings have  the same basic needs For community  and tradition. You can trace it  back to mayan times. Right. Because the mayans are never wrong. ( school bell rings ) Lacey: God, I'm dreading this weekend. Fall fest is such a production. I know. I kinda  wish I was going. Come on! You're getting a night out in manhattan. Yeah, with my parents  and my brother. I had the most perfect dress  picked out for evening formal. Yellow with this bright red  frill shooting off in every  direction. Archie, sarita and scott  are all ditching too. It is a weird year.  A.R. "after regina." Right. ( chuckles softly ) - Gosh, she was so into it.  - ( mumbles ) Do you ever dream about her? All the time. It's like she has  her own room in  my subconscious. I dreamt about her last night. I asked her about that necklace. You know, that red and gold one she was always wearing. Oh, the one that the police  were asking about? Yeah. I wonder where she got it. You should ask  regina's mom about it. No, I don't wanna bother her. Danny desai should not  be allowed to attend  the festival. This is about  more than safety, all right? This is a family event.  Something I did as a kid, And now do with my kids. Okay, let's settle down. I know the media attention  has us all a bit on edge, But I can't bar any resident  from attending. Exactly. Who are we  to judge danny desai? The police have had  weeks to arrest him  and they haven't. Yeah, but that doesn't  make him innocent. We're not here to  talk about the case, We're here to talk about  safety at fall fest. And I want to assure  everyone in this room That I take that  responsibility  very seriously. Well, how are we supposed  to believe that,  chief masterson, When you allow your daughter  to cavort around town with  the killer? Leave my daughter  out of this, tim. All right, all right, everyone. Let's just take it easy. Let's just lay off chief masterson, huh? Mayor rollins, I have been  attending this festival  since I was five-- And I've been going since I was three. So I guess I got you beat there, tim. - ( scattered chuckles )  - now look, danny desai Or no danny desai, I know this is gonna be A fantastic, safe, fun fall festival. And chief masterson is  gonna make sure of it! Isn't that right,  chief masterson? All right. ( exhales ) ( slurps ) So, do you think there's some sort of massive Town event this weekend? Possibly. Maybe one  involving... Fall. Good call. God, do you remember  that crazy dance You, me and lacey  used to do at the  evening formal? Yeah. Yeah. We used to kinda  have fun at this  thing, huh? Yeah, we did. You should go. Me? To the festival When actual people are attending it? Yeah. Why not? What if I went with you? "a lame, cheesy, outdated tradition packed with... Fanatical town spirit zealots"? I never said  it was cheesy. Let's just go for  a little bit tomorrow. Yeah. Okay. Sure. ( sighs ) Hey, lace.  What's, uh-- - What's happening?  - I'm just waiting  for my food. Hi, jo. Lacey. So, jo and I Were talking about  fall fest. You going? - I have to, my mom's  an organizer.  - Danny: Ah. You're not going, are you? - We were talking  about it, yeah.  - Really? Everyone's pretty tense  after that raid. Oh, the raid that didn't turn up any evidence? That we know of. Mm. You were regina's b.F.F. You'd think you'd know all sorts of stuff. Okay, ladies.  That's enough Banter for one evening,  I think. Really, jo? Like what? Oh, I don't know. How about Where regina got that necklace. What do you know  about the necklace? Okay, lacey, look. That necklace... That necklace belonged  to my aunt tara. That's why the police  are so intent on my guilt. Yeah. Can you blame them? Danny was locked up  for five years, lacey. Don't you think that  the person who gave  regina the necklace Might be connected to-- Just stop it, jo. This isn't a game.  Regina was a real person. I never said she wasn't. And how can you go  to the festival With all this craziness  going on? It's selfish! You're making it  all about you! Don't listen to her, okay? She's wrong. - Hey, check it out.  - ( indistinct whispers ) Man:  That's danny desai. Hey, mrs. Masterson. Uh, jo around? She just ran to  say hi to rico. So...  ( chuckles nervously ) How's it going so far? Lots of glares and tense looks, Which is pretty much par for the course-- So good, I guess. You teaching a pottery class? - Yeah.  - That's cool. I've always wanted to learn how to make one of these. Oh, you should sign up. Really? You sure that's okay? Yeah, of course it is. You're signing up? That's awesome. Well, I came, I saw, I didn't exactly conquer. But no one spat on me. Right? Bonus. Do you wanna leave? Let's go get some food. Actually, I signed us up to  work at rico's mathlete booth. We could go to  the formal tonight. Jo. You wanna come tonight? Don't say no right away, But I saw a dress  a few booths down And I think it would  look great on you. Uh, um-- Don't speak. Here. Stay. ( sighing )  she's been trying  to put a dress on me For years,  that poor woman. ( laughing ) So, um, what happened to "check out a couple of booths and leave"? I just don't wanna push my luck, okay? Don't let lacey  get in your head. If you wanna do fall fest,  you should be able to do it. Well? It's, um-- It's a dress. I think you'd look  amazing in it. Actually, I--  ( sighs ) I think I might  just wear something  out of my own closet. You know, like,  nice pants, Maybe a fancy sweater. Pants... And a sweater. How festive. ( chuckling ) You are so thoughtful  to bring these by. This is from Your girls' weekend  in cape cod last year, - Isn't it?  - Yeah, I think it is. Ohh, look at that smile. Mrs. Crane, do you know  where regina got that necklace? No, I have no idea. Chief masterson asked me the same question. Yeah, me too. What did you tell him? Well, just that she started wearing it six or seven months ago. She told me it was a gift. She never said  who gave it to her? Lacey, what is this about? Nothing. I'm sorry. Just curious. Well, lacey, if you don't mind. I have a lot of work to do. I'm finally getting to all these condolence letters. Do you want some help? I could sort it all for you,  make a list of everyone who  wrote to you, So it's easier to reply. Ohh... Lacey, that would be wonderful. Thank you. - ( people chattering )  - ( police radio chatter ) - John.  - ( door closes ) My office has been  getting calls all morning. Guess who decided to spend  the day at the festival? And guess who he was seen  hanging around with? Oh, what a fun game. Let me see. Um, wavy hair, surly smile, Answers to the name of jo? That's right. Along with your wife. What do you want me to say? I've been busy. Yeah, busy making a mockery  of this town. That raid was a p.R. Nightmare. And as far as I can tell,  this entire crane investigation - Is a complete mess!  - I'm working on it. That necklace is still  the best lead we have. That's what you were looking for at the desai house? A necklace? We're looking for the link between regina and tara-- How the girl got that thing. It was in police custody after tara's death, Then the estate lawyers. But nobody has a record Of who it went to next. What about a freaking  murder weapon?! Danny had to hit  the girl with something. We haven't found one yet. But there were traces of paint at the point of impact. - Paint from what?  - I don't know. There's a lot we don't know. That crime scene was  a mess because of that party, The alibis are a blur,  'cause everyone was drunk. You see where I'm going  with this? The necklace-- Fall fest... Is the most important day  of the year for green grove. You know that.  Anything goes wrong, I'm holding you  personally responsible. Are we clear, kyle? Crystal clear... John. Come on, buy warm pi pies. They pun and they taste great. Buy a fresh pi pie,  help the mathletes  earn money for, um-- What do you need  the money for? Travel costs,  hotel rooms... ( sighs )  note cards... Like to  memorize stuff. - It's going well, huh?  - I guess. Come on, danny's a selling machine. And no offense, but your mathlete buddies Aren't exactly born salesmen and women. ( shakily ) hey, do you wanna buy a pie From me? Okay. Can you carry these pies  over to the table? - Yeah.  - Thanks. Are you okay? I thought you wanted my help. Yeah, your help. - More enthusiasm.  - More enthusiasm. - More enthusiasm.  Pi pies for everyone!  - Pies! Sir, would you like  to buy a pi pie? Not from you. Where do you get off Being here, acting like everything's okay? - Leave him alone.  - Can you back the hell off? He has as much of a right to be here as you. Okay, maybe we should  just calm down, because-- It's cool.  I can just leave. How can you defend him?  He's a freaking murderer! - You're a right wing nut!  - Are seriously that stupid? I'm looking out  for our kids! - He is one of our kids.  - Oh! - Sir? Sir?  - Hey! ( grunts ) Hey hey hey hey, tim! Tim tim! Keep your  hands off him, tim.  Okay? Okay? Yeah. Okay, people.  Let's settle down. Nothing else to see here.  Let's move on, okay? ( claps hands )  come on, have a great day. Enjoy the festival. ( crowd murmuring ) - Some of them seem edible.  - ( exhales ) - That one's--  - it's fine. We have more. Okay. And danny said he was gonna go pick up some more pies at the diner. You know what?  I think danny's done enough. Come on, rico. We're gonna have fun tonight. All three of us. You're-- you're going  to the formal tonight? With him? After what just happened? It was one isolated incident. It's not going to be  if you go tonight. It's gonna be fine. My dad won't let anything else happen. Why do you wanna go  all of a sudden? Just for danny? He's been in juvie for five years. - Right.  - I just feel like he deserves To have some fun, okay? He can't go alone. He needs me there. Okay, so we'll see you tonight then? Sure. Okay. Thank you! Danny. Hey. Thank you for  stepping in back there. You kinda kicked some ass. - Just doing my job.  - I know. I just didn't know that your  job involved protecting me. I'm responsible for protecting everyone who lives here. And you're making that much harder by being at the festival. You understand that, right? ( mouths ) Where you headed now? Just bringing these pies to  rico, and then I'm gonna go  home, Probably get changed  for tonight. I'll take these to rico. I think we both know you've had enough fall fest this year. It's jo's idea, By the way,  to go tonight. She really needs this. She can still have it. Just not with you. I just thought it was time to check in and follow up on danny's progress. So? How's he doing? Well. He's a smart young man. Yes, he is. And dr. Reidy, I am sure that you've heard Some of the hateful words people are using to describe danny. "monster, freak... Sociopath." I wouldn't let it  get to you, mrs. Desai. It's a heightened time. Oh, I know. But as a mother, How should I respond to people calling him that? I'm not being clear. Uh... What are the signs that someone is a sociopath? So that I can explain why danny isn't one. Most sociopaths  don't murder anyone. But they do  exhibit glibness, Superficial charm, An easy ability  to lie. - Right.  - Hmm, let's see, what else? They love risk. They don't consider  consequences. They have a talent  for imitating  human emotion. Grief, joy-- It's never real,  but they're good at  making you believe it is. Was that helpful,  mrs. Desai? Yes, dr. Reidy. Thank you. So, how'd she do? Good. Sold some pots,  got some class sign-ups. She's still trying to get me  to wear that dress tonight... But other than that,  she's a happy tess. Do you wanna, uh-- do you wanna stay in tonight? Maybe rent a movie, grab some take-out? Okay. Yeah. I just-- I thought  you wanted to go. Don't put this on me, jo. If you wanna go tonight, then just go. Danny, I just--  ( sighs ) I just feel like  if you hide away  and act like Some pariah killer,  then you're just... Confirming what most  people already think  about you. That's not a good enough reason to go and you know it. Everything okay? Fine.  We're not going tonight. Oh. Why is that? Danny changed his mind. Did you change your mind? Honey, I know you. You can say you hate this all you want, But ever since you said you were going, I can tell how happy it's made you. I cannot believe  you promised to do all this. Guilt is a powerful motivator. So you asked about  some stupid necklace. So what? Well? How do I look? Sexy. Manhattan sexy? ( laughs ) How I'm wearing  too much makeup  right now, But I'm like, "mom,  we're going to new york.  This isn't the '60s With these bra-less wonders  and the no makeup." Like, this is new york. I'm gonna be seeing these  really cute broadway boys. I mean, I know that  they're all gay, But if anyone  could turn them,  it would be me.  As long as I have a lot  of makeup and the dress And the attitude  and the moves-- What's wrong? I look like a whore,  don't I? ( voice breaking )  what is it? Is it  too much lip gloss? No, phoebe.  You look great. ( quietly )  okay. Wow. You look incredible. - How did you, um--  - oh, me? It was all tess. You should have seen her. She was, like, foaming at the mouth With mom joy. I bet. I'm glad you decided to go. Me too. - But I want you  to come with me.  - Look-- You were right. Fall fest did mean  a lot to me. But part of the reason  why it meant so much  was because... I was there with you. Come on, you're gonna  make me do Our funny dance  all by myself? ( chuckles ) That's not fair. ( exhaling )  okay. You look like your father. Yeah. I should. This is  one of his old suits. Amazing it fits me, huh? I'm glad you kept it. Could you, uh-- Could you help me  with this? Jo's waiting out front and she gets a little impatient. Didn't your dad ever  teach you how to tie  a tie? Yeah, I guess I'm just out of practice. Not a lot of occasions for formal wear in juvie. ( laughs )  good point. All done. Thanks for the help, mom. I'll always help you, danny. That's my job. - ( soft music playing )  - ( people chattering ) It's lovely, isn't it? Regina always said the fall festival... Was her favorite day.  I know. She'd spend weeks looking for the perfect dress. If she found out  your outfit had like  one color in common, - She'd force you to  wear something else.  - ( chuckles softly ) - She could be such  a pain in the ass.  - ( laughs ) Are you leaving already? Yeah, I just wanted to come by and see this. I don't do very well with big social events these days. I'm glad people are remembering her this way. This... Fun, beautiful girl.  Happy. Full of life. Our fall festival  draws people from  all over the state. Today I met a couple  from niagara falls. When you've got the biggest  waterfall in the world, And you come to see us-- ( murmuring ) Mayor rollins, it's an honor to meet you. Thank you, danny. You both look wonderful, But why don't you just  head on home, okay? - What's going on here?  - Chief masterson,  there you are. Hopefully you can talk a little sense into your daughter here. We don't wanna  mess anything up, We just wanna  be a part of it. You can stay, honey, but-- If danny leaves, I leave. Look, we can leave If that's what you guys  really want. But if you kick us out, I mean, that's  a news story tomorrow. I see, and it's a-- A better story if you attend? At least it'll be  about fall fest. Not if there's another disruption. Danny:  There won't be. People listen to you. They respect you. So... What's it gonna be? The lucky contestants  chosen at random Of this year's fall fest  apple toss. Haley lyndon! - Come on up, haley!   - ( applause, cheers ) Tim calvert! Tim! And... Danny desai. ( murmuring ) Now settle down, folks.

The person who throws  the most apples into  his or her barrel wins. Ready, set, toss! - ( all cheering )  - ( upbeat music playing ) Go, danny! Go, desai! Come on, danny. Hey. You look, uh...

Look, just so you know,  I didn't come here  to defy you. Then why did you come? Your daughter, sir,  she can be very convincing. Tess: Here. Just take it. In case you wanna add  a little color later. Okay. - Come on.  - Bye. I'm gonna walk around. Okay. - You want me to--  - no. I'll see you later. Thank you. Hey. Jo, that dress is amazing. Thanks.

After what we just did,  I don't think We can embarrass  ourselves further. Anything's possible, danny. Come on. - Come on.  - Okay. Relax.  Relax, masterson.

It's probably nothing. Wanna meet at  the diner later? - Yeah, sure.  - Okay. Hey. Hey, lace. I got your text.  What's up? What's all the secrecy? This was sent to regina?  When? It was postmarked two days before she died. We have to take this  to the police. - No, I can't.  - Come on. Chief masterson is  two blocks away. I can't! Not yet. What if this has nothing to do with what happened to her? What if it does? I'm sorry. I'm just not ready to screw with how everyone-- How they all remember regina. I owe it to her to find out what this means first. We have to figure out who sent this! You and me, we have to go-- And jo-- I'm not  keeping this from her. Her dad's the chief of police. I'm not keeping  this from her! Why do you wanna meet  like this? How were we supposed to meet? You could have texted me,  you could have called me, You could have talked  to me in the school. Why like this? Unless... Unless you wanna  get me alone. You know what? Screw you. Lacey, I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said that. ( sighs ) Lacey, wait wait wait. Hey. Hi. So danny and I  are meeting up  at the diner soon. Do you wanna join? My feet are pretty uncomfortable in these shoes. I think they're giving me, like, a bunion or something. It's like chafing on the flesh of my big toe. - So my mom put some vas--  - okay. - Too much.  - ( quietly ) okay. Okay, well, I'll just  see you later then. Why do you trust him? He lied to us,  like, a lot. Regina had his  aunt tara's necklace? He didn't lie, He just-- he just didn't tell us. It's the same thing. Danny and I have been best friends since we were born. I'm just not gonna give up on him. I gotta go home. Okay. Well, do you want  my parents to give you a ride? No, I can walk. I thought your feet were like-- I'll be fine. You want me to make  some coffee? No, thank you. Okay, just say what's on your mind, kyle. You didn't open your mouth the whole drive home. He's taking your class. I saw the sign-up sheet When you came back  this afternoon. Fine. You want me  to call danny And kick him out  of the class? This isn't about the class. Then what's it about, kyle? You're supposed to be  on my side. She was so happy tonight. I haven't seen that girl  in a while. Gee, I wonder why that is. I know you blame danny  for everything, But him coming back here--  it's been good for her. My god, tess!  You're being charmed by  a freaking psychopath! Don't yell at me. He killed someone. He wrapped a jump rope  around her neck, And strangled the life  out of her. But whatever, right? Who cares that he  most likely killed  a second person-- A person  jo's age this time. If it's so obvious danny did that, Then why can't you find any evidence? Well, that's great. I'm hearing it from  my daughter, the town, - The mayor and now my wife.  - What do you want me to say?! That you're with me!  That you wanna help me, That you care about  our daughter's safety. I care about jo's safety just as much as you. It sure doesn't  seem like it. Don't take it out on me Just because you can't solve your case. ( acoustic guitar  music playing ) ¶ do you give much?  ¶ do you take more?  ¶ do you know what's good?  ¶ build your tower  ¶ all the ladders  ¶ grab the reason to...  What's going on? Lacey, uh--  lacey found something. ¶ I sit by the shacks  ¶ and wait for my share  ¶ then come home to you  ¶ do you read much?  ¶ does this make sense?  ¶ I've been saving  this line for you. ¶
