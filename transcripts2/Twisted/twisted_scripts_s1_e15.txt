Charlie McBride. - What the hell are you doing here? - Easy. - So what, you followed me? I remember how you were such a good friend to me on the inside. I just want to start over.

 - What do you think of her? - Who, Andie? I think you should ask her to homecoming. This is one of the greatest nights of my life. This is probably one of the greatest nights of my life too. I'm on the soccer team with Danny he had a lot of nice things to say about you. In the first day that he's been back? Guys talk, especially about pretty girls. He's my husband. He was your husband when we were together. That was a long time ago. Vikram, Kyle's looking for you. He's determined to find you. I'm so confused. I've been searching, trying to prove

 that Vikram's still alive and you knew he was! You are gonna come down to the station first thing tomorrow. You're gonna give an official statement. Hello. I'm on my way. They found Vikram. He's dead. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I just missed you. I missed you too, more than you know. After everything that we've been through... It's okay. That's all over. All that matters to me right now is being here with you. Sorry. I'm gonna turn this off, okay? Yeah. What's wrong? Uh... Actually, it's, uh... it's... it's my... it's my dad. He... Did they find him? Where is he? Uh, he's dead. What? I should probably go, actually. Yeah, I'm coming with you. No, no. Um, my mom, she's gonna be a mess. Uh, I should go alone. Okay, yeah, whatever you need. I'm sorry. Danny, no. This isn't your fault. Did your dad say anything else? Just that they found him. He left before I could find out more. I should've known. A normal life was never an option, not for me. It's not too late. We'll explain what happened. They have to believe us. You sure about that? We'll face it, whatever happens. We should be seeing lights by now. Yeah. This doesn't make any sense. What? What is it? He's gone. - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com - Okay, you're good. I just chased two reporters away already. So just keep 'em back as best you can, okay? - Will do. - I want the family to hear this from me. Hold on a second, guys. Yeah, go ahead. Hey. What are you still doing here? Uh, well, you know. I patched that car up pretty quick. I want to make sure Danny gets home in one piece. And that's the only reason why you stayed? The scenery's not too bad, either. Oh, speak of the devil. Hey, sweetie, did you have a nice time with Lacey? She dig the wheels? Oh my God, what's wrong? Mom, uh, it's... it's dad. Did he contact you? No, he... Kyle? What are you doing here? There's been a car accident. It's Vikram. I'm sorry, but he's dead. Oh my God. Wait, wh... a car crash? Where? I'll explain on the way. Karen, we need you to come down and identify the body. Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna come with you. - Yeah, go, I'll lock up. - Okay. You have a key? I know where she keeps it. Jo, hey. Where'd you run off to? I just wanted to check on Danny. How is he? He's shocked. Are you okay? Yeah. I... I heard you and dad talking. It was something about a report? Don't worry about it. Um, I'm just upset about Vikram. I know he did a lot of terrible things, but he was a really sweet guy in high school. Do you... Do you know what happened? Car accident. On Cutler's ridge. It was on the news. He may have been drinking. We all know what a problem that had become. Well, I'm gonna go to bed. I'm really tired, so... Okay. It's him. Even with everything he did, I know it isn't easy. Thank you, sir. I'd like this wrapped up as quickly and discreetly as possible. I want that bastard in the ground. Mom, he's got... he's got a job he's got to do. Yeah, and the sooner he does it, the better. That man was involved in an innocent girl's murder. And he was more than happy to let you rot for it. - I'll do everything I can. - Thank you. Look, honey, I know you're overwhelmed. But we're gonna be okay. This nightmare is finally over. And we can move on. Things are gonna turn around for us. Turn around? How are they gonna turn around, mom? Your father had a life insurance policy... for $10 million. What? Wh... why? He did that for us? Hmph, well, knowing your father, he probably faked his death to get the money. Come on, sweetie. You've been through enough for one night. What the hell is going on? I have no clue. What did my dad say? There was a crash. That he's doing an autopsy. But, Jo, he's not suspicious at all. So someone's just... just cleaning up the mess. There's something else. My mom says that there's an insurance policy, like millions. What? I know. If I had told the truth about what happened, everyone would have thought I killed my dad for the money. I would have gone to jail for the rest of my life. I just... I don't get it. Someone moved his body, put it in that car. I mean, is someone trying to protect us? Oh my God, my mom. - What? What is it? - Earlier tonight, I heard my parents talking. My dad wants my mom to make a statement. But she won't talk to me about it. And then there's my mom. I mean, she'd do anything for me. And she knew exactly how much money she'd get if the body was found. At least we know we can trust them. What if... what if it's someone who doesn't want to help us? You know, what if this person who moved the body and faked the accident... what if... what if they want something, you know? - To keep quiet. - Like blackmail? Yeah. Oh, this is so messed up. We have to find out who it is, Jo. Okay, they know. They know what I did. No, Danny. What we did. It's just the one coffee. Thanks. Hey, Jo. You're up early. Yeah, so are you. We um... we never went home. We went to this after-party, but it kinda sucked. Yeah, it was like a monster-truck rally of humanity... With sex. Yeah, we went for a walk instead. And then before we knew it, it was dawn. We recited Keats and Shelley to the rising sun. You should try it sometime. It's really... it's exhilarating. So how does your mom feel about this? Uh... She's probably calling the cops, alerting the media, but I don't know. I don't think I care. Plus, I wanted to have one last meal before reaping the whirlwind. Chocolate chip waffles, extra olate chips. It's our favorite. Eat with us, Jo. I want to talk about your mom's fundraiser... for the Children's Burn Foundation. Oh, did you know the foundation saved her sister's life? Andie's super involved in them. She's even on the prevention committee. Our future valedictorian is basically a Saint. I'm not a Saint. Plus, I'm totally going to have to share - valedictorian with you. - Well, not if your genome models turn out like I think they will. - You really think they're that good? - Yeah. Okay, so, thanks for the offer. But I've got to run. I'm just grabbing this coffee for my dad, so... Oh, I forgot to ask. How was your night? Oh! It was... it was uneventful. I just... I went home early. Go get your waffles. - Here you go. - Oh, thank you, here. - Oh! I'm... - Oh! Sorry. It's totally my fault. Hey, are you okay? Yeah, no spills, so... No, I meant about Danny. The accident, you know. It was all over the news last night. Oh. Yeah, I think... I think we're all just in a state of shock. Yeah, I can imagine. Freak accident like that. Well, hey, I mean, if you see Danny, will you let him know I'm sorry? Yeah, definitely. Well, I should go before this gets cold, so... Right. See you. Bye. And, hey, uh... watch where you're going, okay? Okay. Thanks. You could tar a roof with the stuff they make here. You never came home last night. Yeah, didn't want any hiccups. We just released Vikram's body for burial. Already. So it was really just an accident. I don't know. A lot of people wanted him dead. But without any evidence of foul play, there's nothing I can do. I talked to mom last night. She seemed really upset. Upset, how? She said it was about Vikram. What's going on, dad? I heard what you said about getting her to make a statement. Did she do something illegal? I had to file a report. She can explain it. Why are you being so weird? Why can't you just tell me what's going on? Because you need to hear it from her. Just talk to your mother about it, all right? Yeah, fine. Hey, wait. Everything's gonna be okay. You knew Vikram was alive?! How could you keep a secret like that? There was a manhunt for my son. - He could have been killed. - I know. It was wrong. I was scared. And confused. And what?! You thought you'd bring me a casserole and everything would be fine?! There's not exactly a roadmap for this kind of situation. Anyway, I'm sorry. And I just wanted you to hear it from me first. You were sleeping with him. Admit it. You never stopped loving him. That's not fair. Oh, and you're in a place to lecture me about what's fair?! - Get out! - Karen. You want me to call the police? And take your damn casserole with you! This is the second time I've lost my father in six months. I don't even know what I'm doing here. It makes perfect sense. You needed closure. Danny, I know that you've been waiting for your father to get caught so you can tell the truth about your aunt Tara. - Lacey... - You should tell now. No. No one's gonna believe me. I believe you. And Jo believes you. People need to know that you're not a killer. Are you really willing to live with a lie forever? I've lived with it this long. Hey, honey. Would you mind if we ordered in? I have so much to do for this charity auction. He wouldn't tell me what you did, either. Listen, I know you have a lot of questions. Yeah, you could say that. They find Danny's dad the same day that you get in trouble for something. Those two things have nothing to do - with each other. - Than what is it? What did you do? Mom. I knew that Vikram was alive. I'd been in contact with him and your father found out. You knew? Jo... I never meant to hurt anyone. But he was scared for his life and I didn't know what else to do. Mom, if you had just told the truth, thing's would be so different. We'd... Why would you do this? - Were the two of you, like... - No. We were just friends. And I'd known him since high school. No, I can't. I can't... Just think about Danny. No! Danny is nothing like him. I know it's hard to believe, but you're thinking about who he became, not who he was. We'd been through so much together and we shared everything. And there was a time in my life when he was the only person I could trust. Did you know where he was hiding? - Did you see... - I swear to you, I didn't. All I have was a phone number. Jo. I know I hurt you and your father. And I wish there was something more I could say. I did what I thought was right. And I was wrong. Maybe you should forgive Tess. Danny, why would you even suggest that? - Tess was... - Dad was the master manipulator. He could convince anyone to do anything. Well, you don't understand. You're not a mother. Hey, who's hungry? No? You're sure? 'Cause I think I saw some tasty casserole out there on the front stoop. We'll just pick the glass out. We can order pizza. I think I have a credit card that's not maxed out. No, no, no. Pizza's on me. I got a great deal on a runabout this week. And I have this great app, lets me order right from my phone. You won't believe how fast it comes. - See? - No, I think it's the insurance agent. They need some signatures. - Hi. - Mrs. Desai? Yes, please come in. Can I get you anything to drink? Oh, thank you, no. If I could just speak with you and Daniel? Uh, Danny? Why? Well, I'll need his signature as well. I don't understand. Danny, what's going on? I don't know. Hey! Hi, sorry. I'm Daniel. Excellent. This won't take long. Why are you involving my son? I'm Vikram's widow and my name's on the policy. Yes, yes, initially it was. But Mr. Desai made some changes. You didn't know. Uh, no, I didn't. I guess I assumed... Well, of course, it was Mr. Desai's policy. He could do with it as he saw fit. And what did he see fit to do? He set up a trust in Daniel's name, with you as custodian. Of course he did. Wait, is he... is he saying that... Yes, your father left the money to you, all 10 million. What is all this? I'm researching your trust. Until you're 18, I have to ensure that it's only being spent on your welfare. My welfare? You know, books, clothes, our mortgage. And I'll make periodic reports to the court. Appearances where you'll be able to say if I'm doing anything wrong. I know you didn't think it was gonna go this way. Must be disappointing. Look, I'm sure your father dreamed this up as a way to punish me. But I'm not gonna take the bait. Whatever his intentions, I'm truly happy for you. Yeah, I can see that. What kind of money-grubber do you think I am? No, mom, you're right. I'm sorry. And it doesn't have to be this way. You don't have to ask my permission to buy stuff. Well, the law is the law. Screw the law. You're my mom. And I'm not gonna take you to court. I'm serious. I trust you. And I don't care about this money. Just think of it as your own, all right? Everything's gonna change. You probably don't want to hear this, but once word gets out at school, you're gonna find yourself with a lot of new best friends. So if you want to talk to me about it... I don't want to talk about it, honestly. I don't even want to think about it. I know, but you have to be prepared. I get it. First, they hate me for the wrong reason and now they want to kiss up to me for the wrong reason. Welcome to high school. But, hey, it doesn't have to be that way with us. I know you haven't changed. Hey, Danny. Hey, God, this sucks, but I forgot my lunch money. Could I borrow, like, a million dollars? Well, if it isn't Danny Warbucks. God, does everybody know? Yeah, some girl's dad works at the insurance company. - It's all over Facebook. - Great. Look, man, when I heard about your dad, I wanted to... How you doing? I mean, I know you hated the guy, but I guess that doesn't make it any better, right? - Thanks, man. - On the plus side, 10 million bucks is a hell of a silver lining. All set. Just need your John Hancock so we can salvage this puppy. Nights have been below the 30s this last week, haven't they? Yeah, so? So it's awfully cold to be driving with your window down. Hold off on the salvage. - Hey. - Hey. So my mom... Yeah, knew my father was alive. I heard about that. Think she knows anything else? I can't tell. She said he was worried that someone wanted to kill him. Somebody did. What about your mom? Um, I'm not sure. This money kinda just complicates things. I'm telling you. She hates me. Miss Moseley's like that with everyone. Just stick to the syllabus. You'll be okay. Dude, are you gonna like buy an airplane now? I guess I could. I haven't really given it much thought. 'Cause you want to know what I would do if I had $10 million? I'm gonna take a wild guess and say, "buy an airplane." I'd start charities. Ten. A million dollars each. Or maybe one super charity. Well, I... yeah... I'd do that too before I bought a plane. - Well, I would buy a house... - Nice. For the animal shelter. Okay, I get it. I'm selfish. You guys, you know there was a time when we didn't talk about money. I think it was like yesterday. C'mon, Jo. He deserves a little good luck. I really don't want this money. I wish I never had it, so could we stop talking about it? Well, that's just silly. Think of all the good that you could do, like for the children's burn foundation event that Jo's mom is doing. You know what? You're right. I'm gonna buy tickets for all of us. Sweet. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. No, no. You're right. If I can do something good, I might as well, right? They're $500 a piece. Put me down for six. Ladies, gentlemen, dress sharply. That was so Bruce Wayne. - Hey. - Hi. I have so much to show you. Me too. I need you to sign this. I'm sorry. I... I... with all of this going on, I've been kind of... Okay, come here. I want to show you everything. You're not upset? I got an "F." After everything you've been through, I'm surprised it's not worse. Than an "F"? I have full confidence hat you will pull your grades up. We can hire a tutor. Honestly, at this point, private school is an option now. Well, maybe I can just drop out of school altogether. It's not like I'm gonna need a job after graduation, right? You are not gonna drop out. Look, I'm sorry that I'm so excited. It's just been so long since I've been able to buy anything nice. Well, you certainly hit the ground running. Tip of the iceberg. There's a new computer for your room. And laptops for, well, everywhere else. Lots of new clothes. You're gonna look so handsome. I'm sure I'm gonna be the talk of Green Grove in this little number. That is for the Children's Burn Foundation event. I had to get it dry cleaned. - You're going? - Why wouldn't I? You threw a casserole at Jo's mom. It's her event, so... Well, if anyone should be hiding, it's her. What is that? Oh, this. Well, I was trying to find a replacement for my wedding ring. And I got myself one little treat. Expensive little treat. Honey, this morning, you said to think of the money as my own. Do you want me to return it? I will. Don't you just think it's like a little bit weird that, um, we got all this stuff because dad's dead. Danny, the man that you idolized never existed. The real person was a terrible man. And you have no reason to feel guilty. No reason to feel guilty about what exactly? I'm just saying he got what he deserved, that's all. Keep the bracelet. You earned it. It is a failing of our justice system when an innocent boy can be just hounded for weeks. Carolyn and I never thought you were guilty. Oh, well, it's too bad you never spoke up. Danny really could have used the support. You know, I'd like to make it up to you. I'd love to have a chat with you about managing your new wealth. I have seen fortunes just dwindle from bad decisions. You know what they say? "With great power comes great responsibility." Call me. - Thank you. - Sure. - "Sidney." - Wow, subtle. Yeah, and I thought everyone at school was bad. You want to get out of here? You look uncomfortable. God, your mom looks incredible. Yeah, she's definitely in her element. Have you seen Jo? No, not yet. Why? Well, if it isn't our long-suffering hometown hero. â™ª Mee, may, mah â™ª â™ª mo, moo â™ª Okay, guys, wish me luck. It's auction time. I'm dating an auctioneer's assistant. How cool is that? Rico, you know my mom does this event like every year. Your sudden interest wouldn't have anything to do with Andie, would it? Where's your dad? Doesn't he usually come to this? Uh, yeah. I think he's... he just has work. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go get my bid on. Kid's got it bad, huh? Yeah, he's pretty cute. We should sit. So do you come to this thing every year? Yeah. Attendance is kind of mandatory at my house. Well, just do me a favor and slap me if I use the wrong fork or something. I am a little out of my element. What's your element? Ah, I don't know if there's an actual name for it, but a microwave is usually involved. Thank you all for coming out to support Green Grove's chapter of the Children's Burn Foundation. All of the items that are up for auction were made by children whose lives were transformed by your donations. I'd like to introduce one of our most dedicated volunteers Miss Andie Dang. Our first item is a popsicle stick birdhouse by Marjorie Dickinson. Beautiful and practical. Let's start the bidding at... $25. 25, thank you, Rico. - Do we have 50? - Can I talk to you for a second? - Oh, yeah, sure. - Thank you. - Do we have 75? - Excuse me. 75, thank you. I see that. 100? - Yeah. - Thank you, sir. 100 going once, going twice... Sold for 100. I know who moved the body. It was my mom. Did she say something to you? No, she didn't have to. It has to be. It's the only thing that makes sense. It's not exactly an airtight theory. I mean, I know she does pilates, but do you really think she could move a body? Well, maybe she got Jack to help her. I mean, he could have easily faked that car crash. And God knows he's got a thing for my mom. Another thing is she seems a little bit too happy to have this money. - It doesn't prove anything. - Yeah, I know. But remember that day that we got back from the woods? I needed to see your dad, but she couldn't get me away quick enough. Now, I try to talk to her, but she wouldn't let me. She's protecting me from myself because she knows. Then you're safe. She would never tell anyone. I might be safe, but if she gets caught and she goes to jail, it's my fault. And now we move on to a piece by Ahtzin Mendoza. And we'll start the bidding at $50. $50, thank you. Do we have 100? 100, thank you very much. 200? Thank you. Do we have three? Thank you, 300. Do we have 400? Thank you. Do we have five? 500, thank you. Six, do we have 600? Thank you, sir. Seven? Do we have seven? So that's 600. Going once, going twice... $10,000. For Danny Desai. Oh, if that's okay with you, mom. Wow, uh, thank you. Da-na-na-na, da-na-na-na. Did you forget? I mean, that's... that's the part where you smile. I just have a lot on my mind. Do you want to talk about it? It's complicated. Well, you're in luck because I am complicated. It's just... it's just there's all these things in life that you can't... Take back. You know? And you keep them a secret and you say that it's to protect people. - But... - But you're also just scared. I don't know about you, but for me this thing happens where the secret, it can become this weapon that you use against yourself. Like keeping it is the punishment you deserve. You sound experienced. Did you... Rack up a lot of secrets at your old school? More than I wanted. But there's some hope. See, I discovered that if you stand around really depressed about it and you obsess over it, then all of the bad feelings, they just disappear. - Mm-hmm, great. - No, no, no, no, no. You are moving way too much. You have to stand absolutely still, like a statue. Fine, what else am I supposed to do? I don't know. Live. Have fun. Run through the street screaming about how great it feels to be alive. Yeah, do you do that a lot? The running, yes. The screaming, I mostly do that in my head. What do you say? Do you want to get out of here? Go someplace, be spontaneous. And do what? We could go skip stones on the Hudson. We'll make it a contest. The shortest throw buys the winner a milkshake. Or you can stand around, do the whole obsessing thing. See if that works out for you. What? Are you afraid you're gonna lose? I was an antisocial girl scout. I could skip a stone to Manhattan. Well, then let's see it, Jo. Live a little. Fine. Just don't cry when you lose. I hate it when guys cry. This is so huge. One gift like this and the others start pouring in. Yeah, it was really awesome Danny could do that. Um, I don't know if you noticed. I tried bidding on some things. Of course I noticed. You were the first paddle every time. I would have bid more. It was just... I didn't realize it was so expensive. Anyway, um, even though I didn't win anything, I thought I could give this to you. It's just all I could scrounge up on short notice. It's like $53. Um, I don't know. I thought maybe you could buy the kids somert supplies for next year's auction. Or something? Is that your disappointed face? 'Cause I know this means a lot to you. And I definitely... I don't want to insult you. No, dummy, that's... my moved-almost-to-tears face. That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard. It is? Why do you seem upset? You just gave $10,000 to a bunch of needy kids. I just hated beg backthere with all those fake people. This isn't the first time, Danny. You've been like this for days, ever since you got back. I don't know what you're talking about. - You don't know what I'm talking about? - No. When you told us the truth about your aunt, that you didn't kill her, it seemed like this huge weight was lifted off your shoulders. And now it's like... it's like you're more tortured than ever. - I'm fine, Lacey. - Stop saying you're fine. I'm fine! What happened while you were gone? - I can help you. - No, no, you can't. Not if you don't tell me what's wrong. Danny, you're bottling up whatever this is. And I can see it's destroying you. You need to tell someone. You're right. I do. Well, I guess I'll head up to bed. You told me Vikram said someone was trying to kill him. Do you know who? You don't think it was an accident. I don't know. And I still don't know why you lied for him, why you believed him. He was my friend. Kyle, how many times do I have to say it? Until it makes sense, Tess! I know you guys dated in high school. Were you still in love? Kyle, is that what you think? You're my husband. The father of our little girl, you're my life. Well, you know me, Tess. I won't quit until I find out the truth. I owed him. I owed him for everything I have with you. Why? Because he never told you my secret. Before Jo... I had another baby. It was right after you'd broke up with me. I was heartbroken. I met a guy at a bar and... And it just felt better than being alone. Well, who is he? Do I know this guy? It was just one night, Kyle. He was long gone when I found out I was pregnant. And... and I panicked. I went to the clinic... But I couldn't go through with it. Vikram helped me. He found a family to adopt. And he paid for everything. And all this time, you never thought to tell me. I was afraid. When we got back together, if I told you... You wouldn't want me. And then we got pregnant with Jo. And every year, it got a little easier not to tell. Where is this child? I don't know. It was a closed adoption. Was it a boy, a girl? A girl. But I never saw her. I couldn't. Please say something. Right now, I wish I knew what to say. Where do you want me to put this? Oh, anywhere is fine. $10,000, I don't know what Danny was thinking. Well, maybe he was just trying to impress the upper crust, like his mother. Well, I know you think it's silly, but I had to go. You know, this town needs to know that I'm done being treated like a pariah and so is Danny. Yeah, well, I'm not so sure he's as excited to rejoin high society as his mom. Yeah, I hate that he's having such a hard time with this. Do you think that the shock is too much for him? He's a tough kid. He'll come around. Well, thanks for coming. I know you hate this kind of thing. Don't act so surprised. You know I'd do anything for you. Good night, Karen. 'Night. Well, I think this'll look great in your room. What got into you tonight? Do you have any idea how much trouble you'd be in if you got caught? "Got caught"? You can drop the act, mom. I know that you arranged dad's little accident. I know that you moved the body from the woods. I guess, um... I can't actually be mad at you. Right? Because I'm... I'm doing the same thing. I'm lying to protect Lacey. Must be in our blood. - Danny, what are you... - Stop! I have to lie everywhere else. Don't make me do it here. You know. You know I killed dad. - synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com -
