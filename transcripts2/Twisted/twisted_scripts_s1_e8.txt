  PREVIOUSLY ON "TWISTED"... Rico:  I SAW DANNY'S MOM THROW  SOMETHING INTO THE WATER. I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE  BEEN A NECKLACE. IF I'M RIGHT THAT KAREN  IS COVERING FOR DANNY, - WHAT, A PARTY FOR MOI?  - Archie: WHAT THE HELL'S  HE DOING HERE? EVERY PARTY  NEEDS A SOCIO, RIGHT? - THAT'S WHAT REGINA THOUGHT. - YOU'RE AN ENIGMA,  JO MASTERSON. - AN ENIGMA I PLAN TO CRACK.  - GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. IT'S OBVIOUS  YOU'RE HANGING OUT  WITH THEM AGAIN. - SARITA, NO, I'M NOT.  - YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS. YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE--  US OR THEM.

 HAVE YOU TALKED TO YOUR MOM YET?  YOU KNOW, ABOUT EVERYTHING? DANNY, WHAT IF SHE KNOWS  ABOUT YOUR DAD AND REGINA, OR THAT APARTMENT  IN CONNECTICUT? LACE, I EXPLAINED THIS TO YOU AND JO. MY DAD IS A SENSITIVE TOPIC. WE GET IT, BUT IT'S  POSSIBLE YOUR MOM KNOWS  MORE THAN SHE'S TELLING YOU. AND AT THIS POINT,  SHE SHOULDN'T BE KEEPING  ANY SECRETS. COMING FROM THE GIRL  WHO'S GOING TO MAKE ME RAPPEL OUT OF HERE  FROM A DRAINPIPE. COME ON, THIS KIND OF SECRET IS SEXY. WE'RE LIKE ROMEO AND JULIET. - 'CAUSE THAT ENDED WELL.  - ( laughs ) CAN'T WE AT LEAST TELL JO?  I HATE KEEPING THINGS  FROM HER. ME TOO, BUT WE DON'T WANT HER TO MAKE HER FEEL LIKE A THIRD WHEEL, RIGHT? I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S SMARTER TO KEEP IT PRIVATE. IF IT EVER GOT OUT-- YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW,  YOUR FRIENDS WOULD FREAK. EVERYONE'S STILL ON EDGE ABOUT YOU AND I JUST BROKE UP WITH ARCHIE. I KNOW IT SUCKS, BUT MY FRIENDS ARE IMPORTANT TO ME. THEY'VE GOTTEN ME THROUGH SOME ROUGH TIMES. SOMETIMES, I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ARE--  THEY'RE ALWAYS GONNA BE  ON EDGE ABOUT ME. THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU'VE BEEN MAKING SOME PROGRESS. TELL THAT  TO THE SOCCER TEAM. NO ONE KNOWS WHY YOU LEFT THE TEAM. "IT GETS BETTER," RIGHT? LOOK AT YOU, QUOTING ANTIBULLYING  P.S.A.s FOR ME. - ( giggles )  - OKAY OKAY. BUT CAN I TAKE YOU  ON A DATE? A SECRET DATE--  McNALLY PARK,  TOMORROW NIGHT, YOU, ME, SHROUDED IN SEXY  SECRET DARKNESS? - FINE, BUT ONLY IF I GET YOU  FOR FIVE MORE MINUTES TONIGHT. - ( grunts ) ( giggles ) YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DANNY RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU? WHAT DID YOU GET  FOR PROBLEM FOUR? JO, YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION NOT TELLING HIM. OKAY? IT WAS SUPER RISKY, ON, LIKE, A MILLION LEVELS. I KNOW THAT. OKAY, SO STOP TORTURING YOURSELF. YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT SOMETIMES  I JUST WONDER... SOME THINGS ARE  WORTH THE RISK, RIGHT? WELL, NO, N-NOT THIS. YOU GUYS ARE FRIENDS. WHY WOULD YOU WANNA RISK RUINING THAT OVER SOME FEELINGS THAT MIGHT JUST GO AWAY IF YOU JUST GIVE IT TIME AND JUST STOP THINKING ABOUT IT, LIKE, ALL THE TIME, EVERY DAY? AND, YOU KNOW, YOUR DAD'S INVESTIGATING HIM AND YOU SAID IT WOULD BE WEIRD WITH LACEY. I KNOW, IT MIGHT RUIN  THAT WHOLE NEW DYNAMIC. DANNY MIGHT NOT EVEN  SEE ME THAT WAY, YOU KNOW? WHAT? NO, THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE. YOU'RE A CATCH. YOU'RE SMART, YOU'RE FUNNY, YOU'RE PRETTY. YOU'RE THE TOTAL PACKAGE. LIKE, OBJECTIVELY, I-- I MEAN, AS LIKE AN OBSERVER OF... YOU KNOW... PACKAGES. OKAY, THAT-- OKAY, THAT SOUNDED WEIRD. - BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.  - YEAH, I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. THANKS. AND YOU'RE RIGHT.  MAYBE I AM SELLING  MYSELF SHORT. - ( clicking )   - WAIT, WHAT'S, UM-- - WHAT'S HAPPENING?  - I'M GONNA TEXT DANNY AND TELL HIM WE NEED  TO TALK TOMORROW. WAIT, JO, THAT-- THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID. I'LL NEVER GET PAST THIS  UNLESS I JUST TELL HIM HOW  I FEEL, YOU KNOW? JUST PUT IT OUT THERE,  SEE IF HE FEELS THE SAME WAY. JO-- YEAH? UH... NOTHING. I HOPE HE LIKES YOU BACK. OKAY, SENT. ( groans ) NOW WHAT DID YOU GET  FOR PROBLEM FOUR? MORNING. GETTING INTO THE OFFICE  EARLY, I SEE. YEAH, THEY'RE STILL  TRAINING ME. REAL ESTATE'S MORE COMPLICATED  THAN IT LOOKS, BUT I'M EXCITED. CAN I DISCUSS SOMETHING  WITH YOU? HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT  ABOUT HOW REGINA CRANE  GOT AHOLD OF THAT NECKLACE? NOT REALLY. WHO KNOWS? I MEAN, SOMEONE MUST'VE  GIVEN IT TO HER, SOMEBODY  WITH ACCESS TO IT. COULD IT HAVE BEEN DAD? NO. HE WOULD NEVER DO THAT.  IT MEANT TOO MUCH TO HIM. BESIDES HE DIDN'T HAVE IT. REALLY? WHO DID? I HAVE NO IDEA. HE TRIED TO CLAIM IT AFTER TARA... THE ESTATE LAWYER COULDN'T FIND IT, SO THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT HAPPENED TO IT. - AND THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD YOU?  - YOU THINK HE'D LIE TO ME  ABOUT IT? I DON'T KNOW,  IT'S JUST ODD. DID DAD KNOW HER?  REGINA? - DID THEY EVER MEET?  - WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING? I'M NOT SUGGESTING ANYTHING.  I'M JUST ASKING QUESTIONS. BEFORE HIS ACCIDENT, COULD HE HAVE BEEN  SEEING SOMEONE ELSE? I KNOW THINGS WERE ROUGH  FOR YOU GUYS-- DANNY, STOP IT,  PLEASE, OKAY? I MEAN, YOUR FATHER WAS A COMPLEX MAN, BUT WHAT YOU'RE IMPLYING IS DISGUSTING! LET'S NOT FOCUS ON THE PAST, OKAY? ( door opens, shouts ) ( theme music playing ) YOU GUYS! SCOTT SAYS HE MISSES ME SO MUCH THAT HIS HEART HURTS! MAYBE HE ATE  A BAD BURRITO. HE ALSO SAID THAT ARCHIE'S HANGING IN THERE. AN AWAY TOURNAMENT IS PROBABLY THE BEST THING FOR HIM RIGHT NOW. YEAH, I'M GLAD  HE HAS THE TEAM. I STILL DON'T SEE WHY YOU BROKE UP WITH HIM. THAT ASS NEVER QUIT. THERE'S MORE TO RELATIONSHIPS  THAN ASSES, SARITA. - LIKE?  - IT'S NOT AS THOUGH  IT WAS AN EASY DECISION. I CARE ABOUT HIM, BUT IT  JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT. - ( phone chimes )   - IT'S HIM. PUMPKIN?  MY LITTLE PUMPKIN! I SO DIDN'T SEE THAT MATCH-UP COMING. WOW, SHE IS A LOT TO TAKE.  TONE IT DOWN, AM I RIGHT? - ( phone vibrates )   - WELL WELL, LOOKS LIKE THE SOCIO HAD AN INTERESTING MORNING. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - SOMEONE PLAYED A LITTLE PRANK  ON HIS HOUSE. CHECK IT OUT. OH MY GOD, THAT'S AWFUL. - WHO WOULD DO  SOMETHING LIKE THAT?  - SYMPATHY FOR THE PSYCHO? EXCUSE ME FOR NOT  WANTING TO BE REMINDED  OF THE WORST DAY OF MY LIFE. RIGHT. SORRY, LACE. IT'S OKAY. I GOTTA RUN. - THIS IS SO SICK.  - I SPENT THE MORNING  CLEANING THEM UP, BUT I GUESS I COULDN'T KEEP AWAY THE AMATEUR PHOTOGRAPHERS. - GOD, I HATE THIS TOWN  SOMETIMES.  - IT'S OVER. NOT EVEN WORTH ANOTHER THOUGHT. LET'S JUST FORGET IT. SO WHAT WAS THE DEAL WITH YOUR TEXT LAST NIGHT? SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT? YEAH, I... DANNY, BUDDY! I SAW THAT WHOLE  JUMP-ROPE THING. YIKES, WHAT A BUMMER. YEAH WELL, THANKS, TYLER. - IT IS WHAT IT IS.  - "IT IS WHAT IT IS." I LOVE THAT.  OKAY, I'VE BEEN AVOIDING  BOTHERING YOU ABOUT THIS, BUT IS THERE ANY CHANCE  YOU'D LET ME INTERVIEW YOU  FOR MY DOCUMENTARY? - A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT WHAT?  - THE SCHOOL, THE TOWN, HOW EVERYONE IS DEALING  WITH YOU COMING BACK, THE FEAR, THE EMOTION. I SWEAR IT'S NOT  A SMEAR PIECE. I JUST WANNA  TALK TO YOU, DANNY, GET YOUR SIDE  OF THE STORY, YOU KNOW? THANKS, BUT I'D KINDA RATHER NOT DRAW ANY MORE ATTENTION TO MYSELF. SUIT YOURSELF. BUT IT SEEMS  LIKE ATTENTION IS  FOLLOWING YOU. MIGHT AS WELL SPIN IT  IN YOUR FAVOR. HOW ABOUT YOU, JO? WOULD YOU WANNA DO  AN INTERVIEW WITH ME? I'M GOOD, TYLER,  THANKS. OKAY, HOW ABOUT  WE GRAB DINNER THEN? YOU AND ME, I'M BUYING. UM... OOH, I JUST  STEPPED IN IT, HUH? YOU TWO HOOKING UP  OR SOMETHING? - HEH.  - WHAT, ME AND JO? NO. SHE'S LIKE-- SHE'S LIKE MY SISTER. OH OKAY. THEN WHAT DO YOU SAY, JO? WANNA GRAB A BITE  SOMETIME? NO CAMERAS--  UNLESS YOU WANT. UM... NO THANKS, TYLER.  I'M GOOD. OKAY. FIND ME IF YOU  CHANGE YOUR MIND. YOU TOO, DANNY, IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND  ABOUT THAT INTERVIEW. IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU. ( chuckles ) WOW, HE'S-- HE'S SUBTLE, ISN'T HE? SO WAIT, THERE'S SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT? HMM? NOTHING,  IT'S NOTHING. I ACTUALLY HAVE  TO GO AND MEET RICO,  SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER, YEAH OKAY! CHIEF, YOU ALL RIGHT? ABOUT HOW WE'VE  HAD THAT NECKLACE IN OUR  POSSESSION FOR THREE DAYS AND HAVEN'T DONE  A THING ABOUT IT? JUST SAYING. I DON'T WANT TO PUT PRESSURE ON KAREN NOW. SHE JUST STARTED A NEW JOB. WASN'T THE PURPOSE  OF GETTING HER THAT JOB  TO BUTTER HER UP? LOOK, IF YOUR THEORY'S  RIGHT AND SHE'S COVERING  FOR HER KID, THEN IT'S POSSIBLE  SHE'S AN ACCESSORY  TO MURDER. AT THE VERY LEAST,  SHE OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE. DID YOU RUN MORE TESTS ON THE PAINT SAMPLE FROM THE HEAD WOUND? YEAH, NO NEW LEADS. IT'S STANDARD INDUSTRIAL  WHITE PAINT, USED ON  ALL SORTS OF THINGS. WE CAN'T BEGIN  TO DETERMINE WHAT,  SINCE THERE'S-- THERE'S NOTHING MISSING FROM THE CRANE RESIDENCE. I KNOW. - EXCEPT THAT NECKLACE.  - OKAY OKAY. I'M HAVING  COFFEE WITH KAREN TONIGHT. - I'LL WORK ON HER AND SEE  IF I CAN GET HER TO TALK.  - COFFEE? YOU'RE GETTING SOFT  IN YOUR OLD AGE. MIDDLE AGE, YOU ASS. NOW GET OUT OF MY OFFICE. YES SIR. - WOW, IT'S APPLE CIDER.  - IT'S SPARKLING APPLE CIDER. - ACTUALLY.  - ( giggles ) GOD, YOU'RE  A DEMANDING DATE. WE GONNA TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT YOUR HOUSE THIS MORNING? WHAT'S THERE  TO TALK ABOUT? I DON'T KNOW. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BROUGHT IT UP. ARE YOU OKAY? I'M GREAT. I'M GREAT NOW THAT  I'M HERE WITH YOU. - ( romantic music playing )  - MMM, SUBTLE. I THOUGHT SO.  I ACTUALLY JUST LOOKED UP "SEXY DATE MUSIC" ONLINE,  IT'S THE FIRST THING  THAT CAME UP. DO YOU WANT SOME MORE  QUOTE-UNQUOTE CHAMPAGNE,  MADAME? ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TODAY... IF YOU EVER WANNA TALK TO ME ABOUT IT-- IT'S FINE.  ARE YOU FINE? I DON'T KNOW.  I JUST-- I MEAN... SEEING THOSE PHOTOS,  IT MUST'VE BEEN HARD. NO, IT WASN'T. ( sighs ) YOU'RE RIGHT, LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT ALL THIS STUFF. I'M GLAD I'M HERE. ME TOO. ¶ Falling in love  with you... ¶ - ( branch snaps )   - ( Lacey gasps ) - WHAT WAS THAT?  - I DON'T KNOW. HELLO!  WHO'S THERE? OH MY GOD. IS HE SUPPOSED TO BE YOU? I-I THINK SO. IT'S FUNNY.  I GET IT. IT'S HILARIOUS.  YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ME. - DANNY!  - OKAY. GET THE HELL  OUT OF HERE! GO! ( shatters ) ( sobs ) ( liquid pours ) HOW'S THE FISH? GREAT. YOUR FATHER CALLED.  HE'S UPSET HE COULDN'T  BE HOME FOR DINNER AGAIN. SOMETHING CAME UP AT WORK. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE  ANYTHING TO DO WITH DANNY. NEVER SAID IT DID. WHAT? YOU'VE JUST BEEN  IN SUCH A BAD MOOD  EVER SINCE YOU GOT HOME. IS IT ABOUT WHAT  YOU TOLD ME THE OTHER NIGHT? ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS  FOR DANNY? IT DOESN'T MATTER ANYWAY. HE DOESN'T FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME. SO YOU TALKED  TO HIM ABOUT IT? NO, I DIDN'T HAVE TO. HE TOLD SOMEONE I WAS LIKE HIS SISTER. UNLESS WE'VE TIME TRAVELED BACK TO THE MIDDLE AGES, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT RULES OUT ANYTHING EVER HAPPENING. - ( sighs )  - YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACT UPSET, I KNOW YOU HATED THE IDEA OF ME AND DANNY. I DIDN'T HATE THE IDEA.  I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS  COMPLICATED. IT MAY HURT RIGHT NOW,  HONEY, BUT... IT'LL WORK OUT, TRUST ME. IT'S FINE. I WAS AN IDIOT TO LET MYSELF GET SO CARRIED AWAY. NO, YOU WEREN'T. I LOVE SEEING  THIS SIDE OF YOU. THIS OPENNESS,  THIS SPARK. DON'T LET THAT GO OUT  JUST BECAUSE IT DIDN'T  WORK OUT WITH DANNY. THERE ARE OTHER CUTE BOYS. YOU MEAN... OTHER FISH IN THE SEA? YOU SAID IT, NOT ME. I CAN HAVE A CAR STATIONED OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE, IF SOMEONE TRIES A STUNT LIKE THAT AGAIN. I'M SURE IT WAS BORED KIDS. HE WAS ALREADY BUMMED OUT  ABOUT HAVING TO LEAVE THE  SOCCER TEAM - AND NOW THIS.  - WHY'D HE QUIT THE TEAM? HE SAID HE WAS  STRUGGLING TO FIT IN. - SORRY TO HEAR THAT.  - YEAH, WELL... THANKS.  OH, AND THANKS AGAIN  FOR CALLING RAY BICKNER. IT WAS ONE PHONE CALL. HOW IS RAY? WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.  HE'S DEFINITELY FRIENDLY, - BUT HE'S HARMLESS.  - YOU SURE? 'CAUSE I CAN HAVE A CAR STATIONED OUTSIDE YOUR WORK TOO. ( chuckling ) OH, I MEANT TO TELL YOU-- TESS GOT SOME GREAT PHOTOS OF THE KIDS DANCING AT FALL FEST. OH REALLY?  I'D LOVE TO SEE THEM. - I HEARD THEY HAD  A GREAT TIME.  - THEY DID. HOW ABOUT YOU? DID YOU HAVE FUN AT THE FESTIVAL? NO, I DECIDED  TO STAY IN THAT NIGHT. YOU KNOW, TIRED. 'CAUSE I COULD'VE SWORN I SAW YOU WALKING INTO McNALLY PARK. IT MUST'VE BEEN  SOMEONE ELSE. IF THERE'S SOMETHING YOU WANNA TELL ME, KAREN, NOW'S THE TIME. I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.  I THOUGHT YOU'D CHANGED, - THAT YOU ACTUALLY  WANTED TO HELP ME.  - I AM HELPING YOU. I'M GIVING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO TELL ME THE TRUTH. THANKS FOR THE COFFEE. YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM THIS, KAREN. EITHER WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT HERE OR AT MY OFFICE TOMORROW. IT'S UP TO YOU. THEN I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW...  WITH MY LAWYER. I CAN'T REALLY TALK RIGHT NOW,  I'M LATE FOR ENGLISH. I JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU WERE HOLDING UP AFTER LAST NIGHT. - STILL KINDA FREAKED. YOU?  - OKAY. A BIT OFFENDED BY THE MASKS. I THINK MY HAIR IS NICER THAN THAT. I'M SORRY, SORRY. - LAST NIGHT WASN'T FUNNY.  - NO, IT WAS SCARY. THOSE GUYS IN THE MASKS  OBVIOUSLY FOLLOWED US. WHO COULD BE DOING  ALL OF THIS TO YOU? I'D SAY IT WAS YOUR BITTER EX, BUT HE'S AWAY AT A SOCCER TOURNAMENT, RIGHT? ( locker slams ) HEY, LACEY, CALM DOWN. IT'S OKAY. NO ONE CAN SEE US IN HERE. - OUR SECRET IS SAFE.  - IS IT? WHO KNOWS WHAT  THOSE CREEPS LAST NIGHT SAW. - HALF THE SCHOOL MIGHT  KNOW ABOUT US BY NOW.  - I DOUBT IT. BUT NEXT TIME WE'LL BE MORE CAREFUL. NEXT TIME? DANNY, I THINK WE MIGHT WANNA  LAY LOW FOR A LITTLE WHILE. I HATE BEING THIS PERSON THAT YOU HAVE TO HIDE. - AND I DON'T KNOW  HOW TO CHANGE IT.  - MAYBE YOU CAN'T RIGHT NOW. MAYBE IT'S GONNA TAKE  A LITTLE MORE TIME FOR PEOPLE  TO GET OVER IT-- YOU BEING BACK,  YOUR PAST. YEAH. I GUESS. I HAVE TO GO TO CLASS. SO HE CALLED YOU  HIS SISTER. AT LEAST HE DIDN'T SAY,  LIKE, "SHE'S MY COUSIN," OR "SHE'S LIKE  A DISTANT NIECE." I'M SO REGRETTING TELLING YOU THAT NOW. HEY, THERE'S ANOTHER GUY  OUT THERE FOR YOU. I KNOW IT. A GREAT GUY. - YOU OKAY?  - HMM? YEAH, JUST NOT MY BEST DAY EVER. - WHAT? - I STILL DON'T GET WHY YOU  JUST DON'T GO FOR IT WITH HIM. WHO-- WHO ARE YOU GUYS  TALKING ABOUT? ( laughs ) HIM? TYLER LEWIS? WHY WOULD JO "GO FOR IT"  WITH TYLER LEWIS? HE ASKED HER OUT YESTERDAY. JO SHOT HIM DOWN. IT WAS VERY HARSH. YOU KNOW WHAT?  YOU'RE RIGHT. WOW. LOOK AT HER GO. EXCUSE ME,  I'M TRYING TO STUDY. AHEM. JO MASTERSON.  HEY, WHAT'S UP? I'M GOOD,  IT'S GOOD. CAN I TALK TO YOU ALONE FOR A SECOND? YEAH YEAH.  GUYS, PLEASE. SO YOU REMEMBER YESTERDAY, RIGHT? THURSDAY.  SURE, WHAT ABOUT IT? DINNER? WE TALKED ABOUT DINNER? WE DID? ARE-ARE-- ARE YOU  SURE THAT WAS ME? UHHH... JO, JO, I'M KIDDING.  HOW COULD I EVER FORGET? YOU BRUTALIZED ME  WITH YOUR COLD,  HARD REJECTION. I ASSUME  YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND? YOU KNOW WHAT?  I DON'T TRUST THAT GUY. - HUH?  - I DON'T TRUST THAT GUY  WITH HIS GLOWING SKIN, AND, LIKE, SMILING  A LOT AND STUFF. HE'S ALL TAN AND TOOTHY, LIKE A SHARK. ARE SHARKS TAN? BY THE WAY, I DON'T THINK HE'S THAT BAD A GUY. HE'S ALL, LIKE, MR. POPULAR,  LIKE, RUNNING CLUBS, STRUTTING AROUND SCHOOL,  THROWING BIG, DUMB PARTIES. HE'S JUST ONE  OF THOSE CHEESY GUYS  THAT GIRLS ALWAYS GO FOR. - AHEM.  - HEY, RICO, - YOU HAVE PLANS TONIGHT?  - PLANS? NO. - WHY?   - YOU'RE INVITED. TO THE PARTY I'M THROWING. DANNY, BUDDY, WHAT'S UP? NOT TOO MUCH.  JO TOLD ME YOU TWO  ARE GOING OUT TONIGHT. YEAH, I'M PSYCHED. SHE'S A CUTE ONE. SHE'S EXTREMELY SPECIAL. ARE YOU HERE TO GIVE ME THE "BIG BRO" TALK? THREATEN TO KILL ME IF I HURT HER? I'D BELIEVE IT, COMING FROM YOU. ACTUALLY  I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU  ABOUT LATER ON TONIGHT. I'M THINKING ABOUT  THROWING A PARTY AT MY HOUSE WITH FOOD  AND DRINKS AND, YOU KNOW... PEOPLE. THE LIFEBLOOD OF ANY GOOD PARTY. LOOK, DON'T TAKE THIS THE WRONG WAY, BUDDY, BUT THESE HYPOTHETICAL "PEOPLE" MIGHT BE HYPOTHETICALLY FREAKED TO GO TO A PARTY AT YOUR HOUSE, YEAH, I KNOW IT'S  A BIT OF A TOUGH SELL.  BUT THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN. EVERYONE HERE LOVES YOU. AND YOU WERE THE ONE  WHO TOLD ME TO EMBRACE  THE ATTENTION, SPIN IT IN MY FAVOR.  AND I CAN'T DO THAT  WITHOUT SOME HELP. OKAY, I'LL DO IT YOU IF YOU LET ME INTERVIEW YOU FOR MY FILM. AND I WANNA FILM THE ENTIRE PARTY. KNOWN KILLER TRIES TO WIN OVER THE MASSES WITH PRETZELS AND BEER? YOU COULDN'T WRITE IT BETTER. FINE.  ONE INTERVIEW. PERFECT. - Kyle: LET'S GO  OVER THIS AGAIN. - Man: CHIEF MASTERSON, ENOUGH. MY CLIENT HAS STATED ON THE RECORD THAT SHE WAS HOME. IT'S YOUR WORD AGAINST HERS THAT YOU SAW HER ENTER McNALLY PARK THAT NIGHT. NOW ARE YOU GONNA LET MRS. DESAI GO OR ARE YOU GONNA TELL US WHAT THE HELL THIS IS ALL ABOUT? PLEASE, KAREN, LAST CHANCE. I KNOW YOU WERE  IN THAT PARK. KYLE, I'M SORRY,  BUT YOU MUST'VE SEEN  SOMEONE ELSE. THE PROBLEM IS I'M NOT  THE ONE WHO SAW YOU. - I HAVE AN ACTUAL WITNESS--  - ( scoffs ) A WITNESS! SO NOW WE HAVE A FICTIONAL WITNESS. THIS WITNESS SAW YOU WALK OUT  ONTO THE DOCK AND THROW SOMETHING  INTO THE POND. WE SEARCHED THE POND  NEAR THE DOCK AND FOUND THIS. THIS NECKLACE IS WHAT? THE ITEM MISSING  FROM THE CRIME SCENE. THANK YOU, CHIEF MASTERSON. I NEED TIME TO CONSULT WITH MY CLIENT. ( door opens ) - TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED. - ( door closes ) TONIGHT IS JUST GONNA,  LIKE, MAKE THE MOVIE. I MEAN, THE DRAMA,  THE REDEMPTION ARC  OF IT ALL, YOU KNOW? PLUS CRAZY STUFF ALWAYS  HAPPENS AT PARTIES. ( laughs ) I'M SURE IT'LL BE A WILD RIDE. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY  WITH THE GAME PLAN? GOING TO THE PARTY AFTER? I MEAN, DANNY IS  YOUR FRIEND. YEAH, HE IS DEFINITELY MY FRIEND. WHAT'S THAT LIKE? THE PRANK  WITH THE JUMP ROPES... WAS THAT HARD FOR YOU?  TO HEAR ABOUT IT?  SEE THE PHOTOS? UM... I MOSTLY JUST FELT BAD FOR DANNY. WHAT, IS THIS ALL JUST SOME PLOY TO GET ME TO BE IN YOUR MOVIE TOO? ( chuckles )  NO, OF COURSE NOT. I'M JUST CURIOUS. ALTHOUGH THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE  DOES BELONG ON A BIG SCREEN. SORRY. WOW WOW. THAT WAS REALLY CHEESY,  WASN'T IT? IT WASN'T NOT CHEESY. I-I-- I ALWAYS GET  LIKE THIS ON DATES. I GET NERVOUS  AND THEN I OVERCOMPLIMENT TO A POINT TO WHERE IT  LOSES ALL ITS MEANING. - NOT THE BEST STRATEGY.  - HEY, YOU'RE DOING  BETTER THAN ME, I'M JUST SITTING HERE, STARING AT MY MENU SILENTLY. ( both chuckle ) THIS MAY KIND OF BE MY FIRST DATE EVER. WELL, YOU'RE DOING GREAT. YOU WANNA HEAR  ABOUT MY FIRST DATE? - I DON'T KNOW, DO I?  - YES, YOU DO. IT'S A GOOD ONE.  KELLY MOSCOE, SUMMER AFTER SIXTH GRADE.  WE SAW "UP." - HER DAD CAME WITH US.  - I DON'T BLAME HIM. YOU COME ACROSS PRETTY RAMBUNCTIOUS. ( sputters )  FAIR POINT, FAIR POINT. SO KELLY STARTED SOBBING  FIVE MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE  AND WOULDN'T STOP. - MEANWHILE HER DAD IS SITTING  IN THE ROW BEHIND US, SNORING. - NO! WOW, SOBBING AND SNORING. MM-HMM. I THINK I MAY BE ABLE TO AVOID THOSE PITFALLS. THANK YOU FOR THE RIDE. - SAVED ME A LOT OF WALKING.  - SURE, NO PROBLEM. AHEM. ARE YOU WORRIED SOMEONE MIGHT RECOGNIZE YOUR CAR? NO. CUT ME A BREAK, OKAY? YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M SORRY. OH HEY, WHEN YOU COME OVER LATER, CAN YOU PLEASE REMEMBER TO BRING PAPER PLATES AND CUPS? MY MOTHER TEXTED, SAYING SHE'S ALLOWING THE PARTY, SO LONG AS NO ONE TOUCHES HER FANCY DISHES AND GLASSES. I DIDN'T SAY  I WAS COMING TONIGHT. WHAT-- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? COME ON, WE DON'T HAVE TO WALK AROUND ARM AND ARM, BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE THERE, - TYLER SAID HE COULD  BRING HALF THE SCHOOL.  - YEAH, BUT NOT MY FRIENDS. I JUST THINK  IT'S A BAD IDEA. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME, LACEY. I'M TRYING HERE. I REALLY AM. I KNOW THAT  YOU'RE TRYING, BUT-- I JUST DON'T THINK  THROWING A PARTY IS  GONNA SOLVE ANYTHING. IT'S A START. IT'S BETTER THAN WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING-- "BLENDING IN," HIDING AND HOPING THAT THINGS ARE GONNA GET BETTER. I THINK WE CAN BOTH AGREE THAT'S NOT WORKING. WHAT DO YOU THINK'S  GONNA HAPPEN, DANNY? ONE PARTY AND SUDDENLY  EVERYONE'S GONNA FORGET  ABOUT YOUR PAST? - ( stammers )  - I DON'T THINK THAT  THIS IS ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE FORGETTING ABOUT MY PAST. I THINK IT'S ABOUT YOU. IF THE MASKS AND THE JUMP ROPES ARE BRINGING BACK BAD MEMORIES, IF IT'S MAKING IT WEIRD FOR YOU TO DATE ME, I GET THAT, LACEY, I DO. BUT JUST LET ME KNOW, 'CAUSE I DON'T WANNA GET HURT. IT'S NOT-- IT'S NOT-- IT'S NOT WHAT? - I-- I--  - GOT IT, I GOT IT. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. DANNY, WAIT. ( footsteps depart ) ( laughter, chattering ) RICO.  THANK YOU FOR COMING, MAN. OH, CAN I GET YOUR COAT? - COULD I-- OKAY.  - IS JO HERE? NOT YET. SHE SAID SHE AND TYLER WERE COMING STRAIGHT FROM DINNER. RIGHT. OKAY, GOOD.  I'M GONNA I'M GONNA DO A LAP,  JUST MINGLE WITH SOME FOLKS. DUDE, THIS HOUSE,  IS IT, LIKE, COLONIAL  OR SOMETHING? OR EARLY MODERN?  IS IT GOTHICA? OR IS THAT  A HALLE BERRY MOVIE?  I LIKE HER. POPCORN. RIGHT OVER THERE. - ( door opens )   - OH HEY, COME ON IN. THANK YOU FOR COMING. THERE'S CHIPS AND DIP. - THANK GOD YOU GUYS CAME. - DUDE, A PROMISE IS A PROMISE. PLENTY MORE  PEOPLE ON THE WAY.  SHOULD WE JUMP RIGHT IN? ACTUALLY, CAN WE WAIT FOR A COUPLE MORE PEOPLE TO ARRIVE? FAIR ENOUGH. - ARE YOU SURE ABOUT ALL THIS?  - ABOUT THE INTERVIEW - OR THE-- THE PARTY?  - BOTH. YOU SOUND LIKE LACEY. SO HOW'D YOUR DATE GO? ACTUALLY... NOT BAD.  IT WAS FUN. ¶ Oh oh, we're getting  it started... ¶ JO MARIE MASTERSON, ARE YOU SMITTEN WITH THIS GUY? ¶ So everybody say  whoa whoa whoa... ¶ I GUESS WE'LL SEE. ¶ Party...  M'LADY. ¶ Every night  ¶ We're going to party  all night. ¶ I CAN'T HELP YOU IF YOU HIDE THINGS FROM ME. CALM DOWN.  ( sighs ) I COULD'VE SWORN THAT  THAT PARK WAS EMPTY. MAYBE THEY DON'T EVEN  HAVE A REAL WITNESS. - THEN WHY DID  THEY DRAG THE POND?  - I HAVE NO IDEA! BUT WHOEVER SAW ME  WAS PROBABLY SOME DRUNK  HOMELESS PERSON - OR SOMEONE  WHO'S NOT RELIABLE.  - NO, WE CAN'T RISK THAT. YOU OBSTRUCTED JUSTICE, YOU DISPOSED OF EVIDENCE IN A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. - THAT'S EXTREMELY SERIOUS.  - I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT  MY SON. I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT NOW YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO CHIEF MASTERSON AND EXPLAIN YOURSELF. MAYBE HE'LL GO EASY ON YOU. IT'S NOT YOU THAT HE'S AFTER. YEAH, IT'S DANNY!  I CANNOT THROW MY SON  UNDER THE BUS. DANNY IS IN TROUBLE ANYWAY. WE'LL FIGURE OUT A WAY TO HELP HIM, BUT I HAVE TO HELP YOU FIRST. ( rock music playing )  ELOISE, I LIKE  YOUR JEANS. - DOES SHE KNOW HOW TO TALK?  - SHE'S CAPTAIN  OF THE DEBATE TEAM. RICO, ARE YOU OKAY?  YOU'VE SEEMED KINDA  QUIET ALL NIGHT. YEAH, I'M JUST OVERWHELMED BY ALL THIS... PARTY ENERGY. I'M GONNA GET  ANOTHER BEER. THIS POPCORN IS UNREAL. YOU GOTTA GET IN ON THIS.  LIKE IT'S-- IT'S CHANGING ME. IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE COMING BACK, SURE. IT'S DEFINITELY, UH... AN ADJUSTMENT. YOU WERE MAKING  SOME REAL PROGRESS  ON THE SOCCER TEAM. WHAT HAPPENED THERE,  WHY'D YOU QUIT? No real reason. It just didn't  work out socially. Got it.  That must be rough. AND HOW ARE YOU  DEALING WITH ALL THESE  VICIOUS PRANKS LATELY? PRANKS AS IN PLURAL? OH NO, SORRY, MAN.  I MEANT "PRANK." YOU KNOW,  THE JUMP ROPES. WHAT WAS IT LIKE  SEEING THAT? LIKE I SAID,  IT'S DIFFICULT. It's hard when  people you don't know are  attacking you like that. THAT'S--  THAT WAS GREAT, MAN. WHY DON'T WE  GO ENJOY THE PARTY? IT SOUNDS GOOD. COME ON, LACE, LET'S JUST GO FOR A LITTLE BIT. EVERYONE'S GOING. PHOEBE, STOP,  IT'S NOT HAPPENING. WHY WOULD I WANT  TO GO TO A PARTY  AT DANNY DESAI'S HOUSE? GET SARITA OR, LIKE,  JANA TO GO WITH YOU. JANA IS HOME SEXTING SCOTT AND SARITA TOLD ME SHE WOULD RATHER DRINK COW URINE. - SOUNDS LIKE SARITA.  - I JUST THINK A NIGHT OUT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD FOR YOU RIGHT NOW... POST-ARCHIE. BESIDES, MY BROTHER SAID THE PARTY IS GOING TO BE EPIC. APPARENTLY SOMETHING HUGE IS GONNA HAPPEN. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HUGE?  - I DON'T KNOW. MY BROTHER SENT AN EMAIL TO HALF THE SCHOOL, SAID WE'D ALL BE TALKING ABOUT IT TOMORROW, AND THAT IT WOULD BE A NIGHT THE SOCIO WOULD NEVER FORGET. - ( pop music playing )   - ALL RIGHT, WELL,  WE'LL CATCH UP. - JO?  - HEY! - HOW WAS THE INTERVIEW?  - IT WAS GOOD, I GUESS. JO, I KINDA DON'T HAVE THE BEST FEELING ABOUT THIS TYLER GUY ANYMORE. I THINK THAT HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT THAT JUMP-ROPE PRANK THAN HE'S LETTING ON. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S JUST SOMETHING HE SAID DURING THE INTERVIEW. - WHAT DID HE SAY?  - IT'S KINDA HARD TO EXPLAIN. - HARD TO EXPLAIN?  - I'M JUST SAYING KEEP  AN EYE ON HIM. - I DON'T TRUST THAT GUY.  - YEAH, HE CONVINCED  HALF THE CLASS  TO COME TO YOUR PARTY. BUT WHAT A JERK, RIGHT? - YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME  TO GO OUT WITH HIM, DANNY.  - I KNOW THAT, BUT-- WHY DON'T YOU WORRY  ABOUT YOUR PARTY AND I'LL WORRY  ABOUT MY DATING LIFE?  SOUND GOOD? IT'S WEIRD TO BE INSIDE THIS PLACE, HUH, AFTER WHAT HAPPENED? RIGHT. SORRY. I'M GONNA GO GET A DRINK, YOU WANT ONE? WOW, LACEY! I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D SHOW. WORD HAS REALLY GOTTEN OUT ABOUT THIS THING. WHAT'S HAPPENING LATER? PHOEBE SAID YOU WERE  PLANNING SOMETHING BIG - AND THAT DANNY  WOULD NEVER FORGET IT.  - NOTHING SPECIFIC, JUST A WILD PARTY IN HIS HONOR. ISN'T THAT MEMORABLE ENOUGH? - JO, HEY, WHERE'S DANNY?  - I HAVE NO CLUE. BUT PHOEBE SAID HER BROTHER IS PLANNING SOMETHING BIG FOR TONIGHT FOR HERE. THAT'S WHY HE GOT SO MANY PEOPLE TO COME. - WHAT KIND OF SOMETHING? - I DON'T KNOW, BUT I DON'T  HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT IT. - HEY, LACEY, YOU CAME.  - WE NEED TO TALK. ( cheering ) RICO? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? UH... I HAD A TICKLE  IN MY THROAT AND I JUST-- I NEEDED  SOME LUBRICATION. COME ON, YOU'RE UNDERAGE. ( speaking softly ) SO WHAT DO YOU THINK  HE'S PLANNING? I DON'T EVEN KNOW, BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST KICK EVERYONE OUT. OR MAYBE IT'S NOTHING BAD.  MAYBE WE'RE ALL OVERREACTING. ( gasps ) ( screams ) THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE  THE WOMAN THAT DANNY... THAT'S IT, OUT!  YOU GUYS GET OUT! NOW! ( door opens ) HEY, THAT WAS FUN, HUH? ( laughs ) YOU OKAY? - SEEING THAT MUST'VE BEEN--  - I'M FINE. - HAVE YOU SEEN LACEY?  - NO. SHE PROBABLY JUST LEFT. DANNY, I'M REALLY SORRY THAT  THAT HAPPENED. HEY, IT WAS MY DUMB IDEA TO THROW A PARTY. I KINDA DESERVED IT. I'M GONNA GO CHECK ON MY MOM. OKAY. WOW. THAT WAS NUTS. HOW'S THE POOR GUY DOING? HE'S PRETTY SHAKEN UP. DO YOU KNOW WHO THOSE PEOPLE WERE? THE ONE'S WEARING THE MASKS? WHO THE HELL KNOWS. I INVITED EVERYONE  WITH A PULSE. BY TELLING THEM TO EXPECT SOMETHING BIG, RIGHT? YEAH, I HAD  TELL THEM SOMETHING  TO MAKE THEM COME. - I MEAN, I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT. - I THINK YOU DID. YOU ORGANIZED THIS, DIDN'T YOU? - NO, JO, OF COURSE I DIDN'T--  - DON'T LIE TO ME. I SAW YOU FILMING IT. YOU WERE SMILING. AND THE JUMP ROPES, THAT WAS YOU TOO, WASN'T IT? LOOK, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE  TO CREATE YOUR OWN REALITY. WHEN PEOPLE SEE MY MOVIE,  ALL THESE THINGS, THESE PRANKS? IT'S GONNA MAKE PEOPLE  SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM. - I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.  - JO, IT WAS JUST A STUNT. PLEASE. I HAD FUN TONIGHT. I THINK WE HAVE  A LOT OF POTENTIAL. WE DID. TOO BAD YOU BLEW IT. HEY. - I ASSUMED YOU'D LEFT.  - I DID. I TOLD PHOEBE I NEEDED  TO WALK HOME ALONE  TO "REFLECT." THEN I SNUCK BACK HERE. HOW IS HE? HE IS CHECKING ON HIS MOM. THE PARTY'S PRETTY MUCH CLEARED OUT, IF YOU WANTED TO GO IN AND TALK TO HIM. IT WAS MY IDEA  TO GO INSIDE. FIVE YEARS AGO,  WHEN DANNY CAME OUT HERE AND HE SAID WHAT HE SAID  AND YOU WANTED TO LEAVE,  REMEMBER? GO GET HELP? BUT I HAD TO GO IN AND SEE WHAT HE MEANT. GOD, I WAS SUCH  AN IDIOT. - ( sighs )  - YOU WERE JUST A KID. I WAS AN IDIOTIC KID. I STILL THINK ABOUT  THAT IMAGE ALL THE TIME-- TARA'S BODY LYING  IN THE LIVING ROOM. YEAH, ME TOO. I DON'T NEED SOME DUMB PRANK  TO REMIND ME OF THAT. GOD, FREAKING TYLER. WHY DID HE DO THAT?  FOR THE ATTENTION? NO, IT'S FOR... THE DOCUMENTARY HE'S MAKING ON DANNY COMING BACK. I CAN'T BELIEVE I WENT ON A DATE WITH THAT GUY TONIGHT. HEY, HE IS HOT. DID YOU HAVE FUN? YOU KNOW, BEFORE WE FOUND OUT HE'S A TOTAL CREEP? I DON'T KNOW.  IT WAS NICE... TO HAVE SOMEONE  LOOK AT ME THAT WAY, THINK OF ME THAT WAY.  YOU KNOW? PRETTY? YOU ARE.  YOU'RE GORGEOUS AND FUNNY AND SMART. YOU DESERVE TO FIND SOMEONE GREAT. - DATING IS SO FRUSTRATING.  - TELL ME ABOUT IT. HOW'S LIFE AFTER ARCHIE? CONFUSING. ISN'T IT ALWAYS CONFUSING? I BET IT'S WORTH IT THOUGH, IF YOU DO FIND THE RIGHT GUY. - HEY.  - OH, DANNY, HEY. UM, I'M JUST  WAITING FOR JO. - I TOLD HER I'D WALK HER HOME. - OH, THAT'S NICE OF YOU, MAN. - YEAH.  - WHERE-- WHERE IS SHE? - OUTSIDE, TALKING TO LACEY.  - LACEY'S STILL HERE? THIS NIGHT IS FULL OF SURPRISES. UH, THIS WATER  IS DELICIOUS. VERY VERY CRISP. YOU WERE RIGHT, YOU KNOW? ABOUT THE... TYLER GUY. I SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO YOU. - SORRY THAT HAPPENED TO YOU.  - THAT'S OKAY. AT LEAST SHE'S NOT GONNA GO  OUT WITH HIM AGAIN, RIGHT? SHE SHOULD BE WITH  SOMEONE WHO GETS HER, YOU KNOW, SOMEONE  WHO APPRECIATES HER. - SOMEONE LIKE YOU?  - WHAT? NO. YOU HAVE A THING FOR HER, RIGHT, RICO? WHAT? NO WAY. UM, WHATEVER. YOU KNOW,  IT DOESN'T MATTER, ANYWAYS. SHE'S NEVER GONNA  THINK OF ME THAT WAY. LOOK, DUDE, YOU DON'T KNOW  IF YOU DON'T ASK HER. - ( door opens )  - NAW, SOMETIMES YOU JUST KNOW. - ( door closes )   - ( girls murmuring ) HOW YOU  DOING THERE, WINO? GROSS.  ALCOHOL IS EVIL. - ( laughing )  - I KNOW. ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA TAKE THIS DRUNK GUY HOME. I'LL STAY.  HELP YOU CLEAN UP. - ( door opens, closes )   - SO... - YOU STAYED.  - I DID. HOW'S YOUR MOM DOING? SHE'S PRETTY UPSET. SHE WENT FOR A WALK, SAID SHE NEEDED  TO CLEAR HER HEAD  AFTER ALL THAT CRAZINESS. YEAH, I DON'T BLAME HER. I THOUGHT YOU WERE  GONNA RUN FOR THE HILLS  AFTER THAT PRANK. I KINDA DID TOO. ( sighs )  I'M SORRY  I FREAKED OUT BEFORE. DON'T BE.  DON'T BE SORRY. I SHOULDN'T HAVE  GIVEN YOU SUCH A HARD TIME  ABOUT THE SECRET THING. AND I KNOW... HOW MUCH YOU'RE RISKING  BEING WITH ME. WELL... IT'S WORTH THE RISK. ( instrumental music playing ) SHE IN MY OFFICE? SHE SAID SHE'D ONLY TALK TO YOU. IT'S LATE, KAREN. I KNOW. THIS COULDN'T  WAIT TILL THE MORNING. OKAY. SHOULD WE CALL MR. DILLARD? NO, NO LAWYERS. JUST THE TRUTH. AND WHAT IS THE TRUTH? IT WAS ME. I DID IT. I KILLED REGINA CRANE.
