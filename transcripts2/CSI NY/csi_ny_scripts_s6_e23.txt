 Hey. I'm talking to you. What's your sign? Aries. Aries. Okay, here we go. With the sun aligned with Jupiter and behind Pluto... it's best you not bend over for the soap later today, but think positive, love can be found in the strangest places. See, chin up. It ain't all bad. Then again... Shane Casey's killed, like, what, six people? Intelligence is always trumped by an opportunity to make the front page. You have a cigarette? What, you on crack? You can't smoke in here. What are you, a little bitch? Did you just call me a little bitch? I just called you a little bitch. You really are as crazy as they say you are. Guilty. Yeah, all right. What the hell. Here. Smoke up, sonny-- They actually asked if we wanted in on the perp walk. Oh, they know us so well. I'd be happier escorting him to a Pris-- NYPD. Move! Move! Hey! Hey! Move! Back up! I'll put a bullet in her head, I swear to God! I don't have a clean shot. You shoot her, we'll drop you before she hits the ground, Shane. Don't do it. Called in a level three mobilization. Manhattan task force is setting up a perimeter, closing streets-- excuse me-- and evacuating some buildings. Plus we got extra patrol in the subways. You want car stops at bridges and tunnels? No, no, he's not leaving the city. What makes you say that? He made his way from Pennsylvania to here, the whole time wanting to be seen. He's got unfinished business. We need to track down where he's been. Okay, where do you want to start? With him. What do you want from me, Flack? It's like I told you. I'm standing on the corner when I see the guy. He's staring right at me. I'm thinking, you got to be kidding me. That's the guy. He gives me one of these stupid grins, he books, I chase after him, I call it in. Five minutes later, you're right behind me. Casey's just walking down the street? Yeah. FLACK: And, what, he's wearing a shirt that says, "I just escaped from Pennsylvania State Prison, and all I got was this lousy T-shirt"? Listen to me, Nicky, we're not Internal Affairs, all right? We don't care where you were. We want to know where Shane was. What were you doing on the corner? I was meeting a CI. What's his name? I can't tell you that. At your usual meeting spot? I can't tell you that either. You call him, or did he call you? I'm not at liberty to say. Look, I'm going to make this real easy for you. You're going to tell me where you were and when this went down or I'm going to subpoena your phone records, prove there was no call from any CI, and make sure you're washing cars over at the motor pool. You at liberty to say now? I was at the Old Cash Bar. Place over on 38th? The one with all the bills on the wall? Yeah. Look, I've been, you know... seeing the bartender there. I was on duty. I know I wasn't supposed to be there, but I wasn't drinking. Oh, man! We were just talking, when, all of a sudden, this girl comes up to me... Excuse me-- Officer? ...says there's a guy in the back playing darts who looks like the guy who's been all over the news during the prison riots. "Shane Casey had been on the run since his escape from prison "approximately one month ago. "The fugitive was serving life without parole "after murdering four people. "Apparently the killing spree started "when his brother Ian Casey "hung himself in his jail cell "after being convicted of murder in 2006. Ian Casey allegedly robbed a bar, killing the bartender." Allegedly? No, no, he killed the guy. You want to know what tomorrow's headline's going to be? "Woman allegedly kills her husband for not helping with the laundry." Come on, we were supposed to leave an hour ago. You see how your mommy talks to me? I'm pretty sure the beach isn't going anywhere, is it? Think you'd get away with that? Killing you? Yeah. Absolutely. You're that confident with your crime scene cleanup skills? Oh, who said I would clean up anything? Oh, of course, you wouldn't leave anything behind, right? No, I would leave everything behind, including me. I wouldn't flee. Self-defense. She's going with self-defense. You were in here folding laundry. I came in with Lucy to tell you I was leaving you. Leaving me. The love was gone. We'd stopped having sex when your impotence problem, and your temper, became too much for me to handle. So I said good-bye and I turned, and you grabbed me from behind. It was awful. I mean, he'd gotten angry before, but never like that, Officer. The rage in his eyes... He started choking me. And I was gasping for air. And I grabbed the vase and I hit him over the head with it. I'd be out of the precinct by noon. I'm genuinely frightened. I don't want to go on this vacation. Pack. I'm going to check in with work one more time. Hey, babe, you see my police academy T-shirt? It's in there somewhere. I remember putting it in the dryer. Mac, hey, it's Lindsay. We were just checking in... What? You are kidding. What? Shane Casey. Is this a joke? I wish it was. The geniuses at the top put him in a room with one officer and no bars on the windows. Oh, brilliant. So what now? Getting caught was definitely a mistake, but most everything Shane Casey does is deliberate, including being seen. We're looking into where he was last night. All right, well, look, we're still here. Do you want us to come in? No, no, we're fine here. You two have earned a few days off. Okay, Mac. Do us a favor and catch this guy, okay? You got it. He's out. Hey, they got it covered. Don't worry about it. Let's... Let's get out of town. Okay? Are you ready? Mm-hmm. The bartender I was talking to isn't in today. Okay, thanks. You were right. He wanted us to know he was here. But why? What's he trying to tell us? Did the girl tell you if he was sitting anywhere in particular? She said he was by the video game earlier, but by the time she grabbed me, he was already gone. He was right there. I swear. It was him. He's been all over the news. He's gone now. No, there he is. That's the guy. Stella. That's the same skull that Shane Casey printed on those T-shirts, remember? "QJ2432." That's Shane's inmate number. He's not done. What's with the Shane Casey guy, you know? If he's got something to say, just say it. We gotta figure out all these clues and riddles and crap. I mean, what if we couldn't figure it out? Be, like, "Hey, beats me, Stella. You want to get a coffee?" Then what would he do? I don't think it's that complicated, Adam. He wants us to figure it out. The last time he printed coded messages on T-shirts. That's his game. He does it to stall us. It took a while, but Mac figured out it was about his brother's wrongful conviction. Which we were able to prove wasn't a wrongful conviction. Your brother was in this bar. He was standing right there. He shot the bartender. I don't want to hear any more of your lies! Here's the most glaring difference. The serial number has been replaced with symbols. Now, no idea what it means. Hold on. I've got something. "E unum pluribus." I'm pretty sure that's on every dollar bill. It is, but not in this order. It's supposed to be "e pluribus unum," which means "from many, one." But in Shane Casey's bill it means "from one, many." I don't get it. You? Not yet, but we need to figure it out soon. When Shane Casey goes to work, somebody always pays a price. Hey, what are you doing? I liked that song. No, we want to rock out. Right, Luce? Yeah? Exactly. You're outvoted. Whatever. 20 more minutes to paradise. Rock on! Remember that guy? Ethan Ganz. Shane Casey's former cell mate. He's got multiple fraud convictions, identity theft using telephone company equipment to eavesdrop on people's conversations. I figured if he was helping Shane then, he's probably helping him now. You run him for an address? I did. His place was empty. Neighbors say they haven't seen him in days. Keep looking. He's our only connection to Casey. Maybe he knows where he is. Any other leads? Too many. Anybody and everybody who sees a Caucasian male with medium-length brown hair is calling it in to the tip line. What about the bill Shane left in the bar? Stella, Hawkes and Adam are working it. Keep me posted on Ganz. All right, the answer has to be in these symbols. He used numerology in the past, but that doesn't seem to apply here. The only number we have is four, which represents "creation" in numerology. I'd say we're overthinking it, that there's a more literal translation, but percentage... parentheses... slash? Well, maybe the two slashes indicate a birth date. That would fit with "creation." So, 2004 or 1904? That means the symbols represent numbers. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, Adam. Really? So maybe the symbols correspond to numbers on the keyboard. Percentage is five. Okay. Closed parentheses is a zero. Okay. Forward slash is a question mark, which doesn't fit, so that would stay the same, Mm-hmm. confirming your date theory. The exclamation point is a one. Pound a three. Doesn't make any sense. What if he changed it up on us... and four corresponds to a symbol? Yeah, the four is a dollar sign. So it would be 50... slash, 13, slash... ...dollar sign. Still not seeing it, Stell. Yeah, me neither. 50, 50... 50 States? 13 colonies? 50 stars. 13 stripes. It's the American flag. Yes. It's The American Way. Check this out. I searched "dollar sign" and "American flag, " and I got this. The American Way by Emmett Vaughan. Casey's running with the theme of "dollars." The bill was folded into a picture frame. Yeah, and it's currently being housed at the Manhattan Museum of Art. If we're right, Shane's got something waiting for us there. ...survey traces the career of a Thai-American... It's among the earliest of his silk screenings, dating back to 1962. Judging from its placement in your museum, I take it it's worth more than just face value? Slightly. At an estimated $43 million. We do have a strict "You break it, you buy it" policy. Well, don't worry. We'll be very gentle. You seeing anything? Nope, not yet. Casey wrote on his bill, "Out of one, many." ? ? Stella... Get a load of this. Hey, I've got something. Right here, the words above the pyramid. "Laquem Nemus"? Now, the real dollar bill says " annuit coeptis." "God has favored our undertakings." Laquem means "noose." And nemus is "tree." All right, Professor, tell me what in the world is Casey trying to tell us now? Okay, hold on a second. I want to take a picture. In the car? We're a hundred yards from the ocean! I told my mom I'd take a lot of pictures. Besides, relax. We're not on a shift. We're on vacation. What? I can just see you when you're 60. "Come on! We're only a hundred yards from the ocean!" You know, this is our first family vacation. Someday, you're gonna be really glad I took these pictures. I am glad right now. Come on. Washington Square Park was not listed as one of Ethan Ganz's hangouts. Sorry. I couldn't resist. Parks Department employee called it in. He found him around dawn. This tree is symbolic. It's called the " Hangman's Tree." Traitors and thieves were hanged from it during the Revolutionary War. Maybe Casey thought Ganz betrayed him somehow. That guy's, like, five nuggets short of a Happy Meal. Now he's got a code of ethics? Okay. "98-06." That's Danny's company from the police academy. Yeah, I saw him wearing that T-shirt in the gym the other day. How the hell did he get his hands on Danny's clothes? Same way he got his hands on this. This isn't about Ganz at all, is it? Shane Casey has other plans. He's after Danny. Danny and Lindsay didn't say much about their plans, Flack. We're still trying to find any sort of specific travel itinerary, but all we know for sure is they're headed towards Long Island. Well, I've sent photos with descriptions to both East and South Hampton PDs. They've already put an alarm out. Any hits on credit cards? No. But Danny's more like me that way; he'd rather pay cash than pay bills. I doubt he'll use one unless he has to. What about their cell phones? He left his at home. But we're still trying to triangulate Lindsay's, not to mention voice mails and text messages. The trouble is, though, Flack, once you get up along the coast, the coverage gets really spotty. All this technology for catching crooks at our fingertips, and we can't seem to use it to track down two of our own. I got more bad news, Flack. We found Shane Casey's prints on one of the building's basement laundry machines. So he stole Danny's clothes himself. Right. We also found evidence of recent access to a telephone junction box in a building utility room. Picked up Ethan Ganz's prints there. Hey, it's official. I just booked our trip. Yeah? The same place we talked about? Mm-hmm. Three days, two nights. Nice. Can you just do me one more favor, though? What's that? Make sure you pack the blue bikini. The place we're staying is amazing. I just checked it out on line. Okay, so, if Ganz was tapping their phone lines, that means he and Shane probably know a hell of a lot more about where Danny and Lindsay are than we do. Oh, my God, how good does this feel? Not too shabby. Remind me again why we cram ourselves into an overpriced two-bedroom in the city? You don't like a view of the building next door? What's the matter? Seriously. Smell that ocean! I think I smell fish and chips. I'm hungry. Come on. Excuse me. How you doin'? Lucy, did you see that birdy up there? Look, look, look, look. Look. Look at all those birdies up there. Do you see them? Mommy... Mommy... Come on. What do you want? Uh, nothing. We're gonna go Mommy! down to the beach. Now you want to go to the beach? All right. Look over there, look. Left, left, left. There's a spot. Yeah, there's a spot... This big, empty... Oh, my goodness. All right. We'll put a blanket down. How about you put... ? Did you bring the towels? Yep. Any luck reaching Danny and Lindsay? I've left half a dozen message myself. And Adam's scouring every inch of their apartment for any info he can find on exactly where they've gone. Sid, please tell us you got something. Uh, well, I sent Danny's clothes to Layout, in case they can yield any clues. Meanwhile, take a look at this. Note the petechial hemorrhaging of Ethan Ganz's eyes. Bluish tint to the skin. Asphyxiation. The man did have a noose around his neck, Sid. Yes, but I also couldn't help noticing there were no rope fibers on his hands, fingernail marks near his throat or secondary ligature patterns of any kind. So he had no defensive wounds customarily found when a hanging victim struggles to remove the noose. Not one. However, I did find this on the back of his head. Small contusion. Looks like blunt-force trauma, in the shape of a ball-peen hammer maybe? With a wooden handle, judging by the abrasions I also discovered in his throat. So he was hit with a hammer, and then choked with it. So which one killed him? Neither. That was the crab's job. What? After I noticed the throat abrasions, I spotted some kind of tracheal obstruction under the fluoroscope... It was too deep to tweeze from his mouth, so I dove in the other way. And let's just say it turned out to be quite a fishing expedition. What is this? Limulus Polyphemus. The horseshoe crab, if I had to hazard a guess. I used to step on those in the Hamptons when I was a kid. Hurt like a son of a... Casey must have surprised Ganz from behind with a blow to the head. Then he stuffed this down his throat while he was unconscious. And he never came around. I don't get it. Ethan Ganz had to be the last friend Shane Casey had in this world. Why the hell would he kill him? Because he served his purpose. And Danny's the endgame. ? ? Ooh... Is this Queen Lucy's castle? Hey, psst. Hmm... Hey. What? Want to make some dough? What is this, a Shell game? Get that out of there. What did Daddy do? What's Daddy doing? Oh, whoops. You know, if we want to get up to the lighthouse before sunset, maybe we should get going. Sounds good. What do you say, Your Majesty, huh? Shall we storm the castle and tear down the lighthouse? Ready? Come on, sweetie. Let's go, Lucy. First of all, our crab dollar's signatures are all wrong. Instead of the correct Treasury Department officials, he's written the names William Kidd and Jacob Hand. William Kidd. That's Captain Kidd, right? Right-- the 18th century pirate who plundered and pillaged his way down the entire Eastern seaboard. What about the other name? Nothing on Jacob Hand yet, or the significance of the altered numbers. One, seven, nine, six. 1796, maybe? Could be a date. Hmm. Looks like he also changed the pyramid on the back of the bill to a lighthouse. Yeah. I've already checked. There's 19 of these on Long Island from Coney to Montauk. I'm going to run an image search on this one now. But there's one more thing, Mac. The Latin inscription beneath it should read, "novus ordo seclorum." "New order for the ages." Instead it reads, "meus fides erum pallium." That's "my belief was stolen." Yeah. What's Casey's motive here, Mac? I mean, is he... is he trying to tell us something, or his he just playing with us? I wish I knew. Either way, we're running out of time. Look at the lighthouse, Luce. Look at that, Lucy. Wow! That is so cool. Here, hold on. I'm getting a picture of you two. ...really tall! Whoa, whoa, whoa. I thought we said we weren't bringing our cell phones. We did, and I haven't used it once, but my camera battery just died, so... ready? Oh, that is so cute. I'm sending that on. That is... Hey. Whoa, whoa, I got something. Lindsay's phone just popped up on the grid. Searching triangulation coordinates. Looks like they're somewhere along the Southern shore. Okay, we're locked on. They're in Amagansett. There's a lighthouse there. The Amagansett Point Light built in 1796. Jacob Hand was its first operator. Captain Kidd? Supposedly buried treasure in its base. So one kept the light... While the other hid in the shadows. Contact local PD, get on the horn, to the U.S. Coast Guard. Tell them we're on our way. Taylor Detectives en route from 34th heliport to Long Island. T-minus ten seconds and counting to liftoff. You ready, Luce? Here we go. Hello! Earth to Messers. Nine... eight... This is ground control to Messer family. ...four... three... two... one. We having fun yet? Oh, man, you remember me, don't you, Danny? And who is this, the little missus? Hi. Shane Casey. Nice work. And who's is this little ball of sunshine? What do you want from us, Casey? I don't want anything from them. Get out of here. Go to hell. Okay. You two can join him. Babe, take her and go. Danny... Take her and go. Please, I... I love you. I love you. I love you. Go... Bye. Yeah, right there. PILOT Coast Guard 623, on approach to Amagansett Lighthouse. Going in. I'll meet you there. Let's go. I've been waiting for this, Messer. All right. Here I am. Obviously, you knew I would be. So, what is it that you want? Shut up! What do you want? What do I want? To shoot the frickin' messenger! You all right? Yeah. Oh, man. Sounds like the cavalry's here. Too bad they won't be able to stop me from killing you. Now, why would you want to do something like that? Oh, please. Don't tell me you already forgot about my brother. Your brother? It was a robbery gone bad. He offed a bartender, and then he... offed himself in prison because he couldn't live with what he did. And you know why?! 'Cause he couldn't live with life's two most important lessons. What are those? What? Guilt... is a useless emotion. Yeah? Okay. Yeah, what else? Ignorance is bliss, my friend. Something that you pretty much screwed all to hell for me. How is that, man? How is that? My brother... was all I had, okay? I mean, man, he was the closest thing that I had to a hero! And you know what? You know what? Thinking he was innocent, going after all those... people that put him away-- it felt good! It felt sexy! And then you and all your friends at the Science Club had to go and ruin it for me. That's right. You hear me, Messer? Huh? Look, I told you then, and I will tell you again: Your brother is a murderer, just like you. That's right! And you put me away, just like him! Guess what? I wasn't like Ian. I can live with what I've done! The only thing I can't live with is knowing that your smug ass was out here pretending to be a good guy. All right. And that's why you escaped from prison? I went through a lot... a lot... ...to shut you up. Do what you gotta do, you sick son of a bitch! Do it! Now! Sick bastard! Hold on to me. Don't worry, Messer. I will. ? ? ? ? Have they found his body yet? The Coast Guard's sweeping the area as we speak, but they don't hold out much hope. The tide was high, and that point's pretty treacherous. Drift patterns could carry his body anywhere from Fire Island to Jersey Shore. Yeah, well, whatever it takes to finish up Shane Casey once and for all. Yeah, you got that right. You talk to Lindsay? Yeah. They were too worked-up to stay. Figured they'd catch a train back into the city and sleep the rest of the week off in the confines of their apartment. That's not the vacation they had in mind. No, but at least they have each other. Home, sweet home. Yeah. She go down all right? Yup. She definitely needed a nap. She's not the only one. I take it all back. What's that? Everything I said about our apartment. I don't ever want to leave here again. It's fine with me. That's what pizza delivery's for. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep doing this. I'm tired of feeling like I've lost you. Hey. Shh. I'm right here. I'm right here, and I'm not going anywhere. You promise? I promise. Here I come, baby. Here I come. Hello. Oh, my God.
