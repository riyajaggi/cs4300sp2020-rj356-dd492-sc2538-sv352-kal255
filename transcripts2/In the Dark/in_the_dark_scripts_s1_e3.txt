 Previously onIn the Dark... I have retinitis pigmentosa, so I lost my vision completely when I was 14. We match hundreds of the visually impaired with Seeing Eye dogs. You pay Murphy to work here, and she doesn't do anything except eat candy bars and take naps. A couple years ago, she got mugged. She probably would have died if Tyson hadn't have seen it and stopped the guy. Oh, my gosh. Help! Something happening to Tyson is probably the worst thing

 that could ever happen to her. Someone killed your cousin, Darnell. Ty is fine. You're Tyson's mom? He's not okay, is he? You know Darnell? Yeah, he's my boy. Want to grab a drink? Fine, one drink. It's a program for a dance recital at Fairview High School. He drew a little heart next to "Keira Shields." Maybe she knows what happened to Tyson. Good

 And I've tried I can't forget it Yeah, you always burn me up...  Hello, Murphy. Hey. So, this is your spot, huh? Is it as horrible as I think it is? Worse. Need a refill? Uh, I'm good for now. Double bourbon on the rocks, please. Sure. Thanks. You want to play a game of pool? I don't think that's possible. Why not? You got two hands. Come on, let's play a round. I'm feelin' good. Taking steps in my direction...  All right, so keep this arm straight. And the hand steady. You all right? Yep. Yeah? Got it? Yeah. Okay. You say I'm foolish... Now just hit it toward my voice. This is stupid. Just hit it. Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it. Hit it, hit it, hit it... Oh, my God, fine. Ay, ay, ay Glaciers have melted to the sea  Did I win? I wish the tide Could take me over I've been down on my knees And you just keep on getting closer  Ay, ay, ay Ay, ay, ay Ay, ay, ay Ay, ay, ay Ay, ay, ay... Should we go to your place? I have a thing in the morning. A thing? Wow, wow. Sounds important. It is. I have to talk to Keira. Tyson's girlfriend. She might have been the last person to see him. Okay. Um... you got plans tomorrow night? To keep you satisfied... No. Ay, ay... Want to hang? And I've done things in small doses  Sure. So don't think that I'm pushing you away...  So, you're hanging out with Max again tonight. Wow. You like him. No, I don't. Yeah, you do. We didn't even have sex; we just made out. Oh, God. You love him. Shut up. I do not. You know what, I'm going to have to sex with him tonight just to prove how much I don't like him. Let's focus on Keira. It's so weird that Tyson never told me he had a girlfriend. Well, maybe you didn't know him as well as you thought. You know what she looks like, right? Yeah, sort of. Her Instagram's private, but that tiny little profile pic thingy, she's smoking a blunt. Follow the pot smoke. Got it. Incoming. Security.I'll handle. Do you have a pass? I lost mine. I just need to speak with a student, Keira Shields. We'll just be a second. You need a pass. Do we really, though? Have a good day, ma'am. Ah, get bent, sir. Hello. Hey, could you break me into a high school? I think I have a lead on Tyson's girlfriend, but the security at the school are being jerks. What do you think the answer to this question is going to be? Tyson is a missing person now. We're working on it. Bye, Murphy. I'll get it. Who's that? Food truck guy. Ooh. Shut up.Murphy, you have a crush. Oh, yeah, 'cause that's totally my thing. Hey, come up. Come down. Let's go eat. Come up. We're having sex. Oh, sorry to interrupt. Call me when you're through. Just get up here. See, Jess? I don't like him. Then why is your hair all shiny?'Cause she washed it. I washed it because I spilled a bunch of stuff in it. Like shampoo? Hey. Let's go to my room. Hi. My baby is a freak like me And she knows just what I like  She carries all the keys to the places  That no one dares to find She won't tell nobody... What are you doing? Are you naked? I'm looking at you. I said we are having sex. That's not how sex works. Explain to me how sex works. It's, uh... my first time. Is it? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can tell. It's not that hard. Uh, first, you service me for 20 to 40 minutes, and then I, uh, kick you out and... never talk to you again. Boom. Sex. But, seriously, take off your clothes. Don't tell me what to do. Take off your... Oh, my God. If they talked, they'd probably  Tell you all about love Oh, concubine, what are you made of?  No resource on this earth is that soft.  I think I might actually like you. What? Shut up. You like me, too. You okay? Max? Jess? Jess, there's something seriously wrong with Max's penis. What?His penis. There's something wrong with it. Oh, I knew he was too perfect-looking. No. I did something. Jess, I need you to look at it. You want me to look at his junk? Well, I can't, and you're a doctor. And a lesbian. Please, he's freaking out. This is exactly how I always dreamed of seeing my first penis. Hi. It hurts to breathe. Let me have a little look-see? Okay. Um, it's very purple.I know. I saw a case like this back in school. Uh, an orangutan fell out of a tree with an erection. It looks like you broke it. Or sprained it. It's hard to diagnose. You broke it.Or sprained it. You're going to want to stay off your feet and ice it for a few days. What kind of doctor are you? She's a vet. Perfect. Here's a fun fact. The same thing happens to octopuses. The female just breaks it right off after sex. Super fun fact, yeah. Read the room, Jess. How did that even happen? He... He, like, caressed my hair and told me he likes me. What kind of psycho does that during sex? You're late. Now, this might fly when your parents are in charge, but things are going to be a lot different around here this week, okay? Oh, yeah? Where are my parents? Hello. The Ride for the Guide fund-raiser? Do you listen to anything around here? I mean... No. Well, Hank and Joy left me in charge, and while I'm in charge, I'm making some big changes. You finally looking into hair plugs? I'm not bald. Really? Your whole vibe screams bald. Well, I'm not. I have a very strong hairline, actually. Let's go. We have a staff meeting. Staff meeting? You're not eating? I'm good with this. I don't want you out here worrying so much, Auntie. My kid hasn't been home in eight days, and I'm not supposed to worry? You know how these young boys are. Running around, getting into something. Tyson always turns up, though. You know that. That friend of his, the blind girl... Murphy? She thinks something happened to him. She don't know what she knows. I got ears on the ground in case anybody hears something. Tyson will be back. Eat your food. Okay, next on the agenda. As we all know, Guiding Hope could use a little PR boost. We only have 75 Instagram followers. How can we up our game? What up, Fievel? Uh... This meeting's about to suck a whole lot less. Water guy is here. It's, uh, Felix. Remember when he called him Phyllis for, like, two weeks? I think you forgot to put the new bottle in the dispenser. Sorry, I just assumed you wanted to do it yourself. Most men do. No, no, no, that's not it. Just that it's, uh, part of your job. Sign this. Okay. Unless the pen is too heavy for you. Damn. These are the moments where I really wish I could see. Uh, right. Where was I? Uh, getting owned by the water guy. Thank you, Murphy. We were talking about getting Guiding Hope some name recognition. We could do a calendar of all our cutest puppies in training. Wait, we should go to a high school. You running low on Adderall? Yes, Felix. I take Adderall. That's why I have zero focus and I'm late every day. No, seriously, you know, high school kids are total jerks to blind people. And don't you always do those outreach... things, you know? We need to do one at a high school. Yeah, high school kids are the worst, so... Ben Fields told everyone at my high school he caught me masturbating to the Blink-182 album cover during lunch. Which album? No, none. It was a lie. Obviously, but it haunted me until the day I graduated. The entire school sang "All the Small Things" when I got my diploma. Oh. My point is, is that, uh, high school kids are awful. Right. Exactly. So I can call some local schools and see if anyone's interested. We might get some volunteers and, at the very least, Instagram followers. Okay, but you do realize you're offering to do actual work, right? Yes, Felix, I realize. Okay. I'll allow it. All right, I want to talk to you guys about telltale dog behavior, all right? You are a transparent idiot. Whatever. I just got my pass to find Keira. Fairview High School... You wanted to see me? What? You wanted to see me.Yes. I called Fairview High, and we're all set for a presentation tomorrow morning. What time do we have to be there? Oh, I-I thought Jess and I would just handle this one. Jess? She's a vet. I always do the outreach presentations. No, no, I know, but, I mean, you have so much work to do here and, like, you're the boss this week and... Well, yeah. I mean, look, I don't want to go back to high school, but my main objective is making sure that Guiding Hope is represented well. You don't think I can do that? Oh, absolutely not. So how are you gonna find Keira if you're stuck with Felix? Oh, easy. I'll just ditch him. And while he's doing the dumb assembly, I'll go find her. 'Cause stoners always ditch assemblies to get high, so all I got to do is figure out where she is. Hey. Hey, there. I'm gonna leave you two lovebirds alone. What are you still doing here? Well, I tried walking down the stairs, but I couldn't. Yeah, I'm sure you can do it. I almost passed out from the pain. Look, I'm sorry, babe. You broke it, you bought it. Gonna have to crash here tonight. But you stayed here last night. So? So, we're supposed to be this, like, casual sex thing. And what if I wanted more than casual? Then go hang out with the other lesbians in this house. Get your ass over here. How was your day? What? Your-your day. How-how was it? Hey. Murphy, what the hell are you doing in the bathtub? Max is in my bed. He's, like, touching me and stuff. Welcome to dating. I don't want to date anyone. Well, I hate to break it to you, kid, but you're kind of dating this dude. There you are. Can you grab me some more ice? Here. Fill it up, please? Thank you. Everything okay, babe? Don't call me babe. Okay. I'd, uh... I'd help you pick it up, but I can't bend over, so... Maybe you'd be more comfortable in your own apartment. I don't think I'd be comfortable anywhere, babe. I'm not the ice girl, okay? You seem pretty icy to me. This "us" or whatever it is, it's not my thing. So you got to go. I don't believe you. Stop acting like you know me. I don't know you, and you don't know me. Which is why we're getting to know each other. I don't want to do that. I like my life exactly the way it is. Right. All your drunk and meaningless sex. I'm sure it's very fulfilling. It is. I bet. Have fun with it. I will. Great. Great. Hello? Down here. What happened to you? I broke my penis. You still smashing that married one? Husband finally find out and take a bat to it? No. I ended that weeks ago because I'm a good person, and this is how God repays me. Well, look, um, I actually came to talk 'cause I need a favor. Oh, now you want to talk. What's that supposed to mean? You should have told me your little cousin's missing. My auntie told me to find out what happened, but Nia's riding me and told me to drop it. Just go behind Nia's back. And end up missing, too? Yeah, okay. Murphy thinks Tyson's dead. Murphy? What, you been talking to her? Wait, let me guess. She's the one who did this to you. So you messing with her? I was. Eh, but I'm off it. Good. Girl's trouble. Oh, what's this favor you needed? I need you to help me skim a little. How much is a little? 15 stacks. Man, that's not really a little. Look, we don't make the drop until next Thursday. I'll pay you back before we have to square it up. Don't let this come back on me. I swore I would never step foot in a high school ever again. The things I do for my career. Oh, man. I'm not feeling so good. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now? We're about to go on. Calm down. You do these stupid presentations all the time. Not to an auditorium full of teenagers. Well, unless you want an auditorium full of teenagers to see me vom on stage, you're gonna have to start. Oh, God. No, no, no, no, no. This can't be happening. Not right now. What?My eyes are watering. You're crying?No, watering. They tear up when I get nervous. It's glandular. I'll just wear my sunglasses. Hurry. I got it. Hi, Dean.Uh, thank you. Pumpkin, how you feeling? Fine. Talked to the, uh, school nurse. She told me that you got your period today. So that's pretty cool. Right? Being a-a woman and all? Okay, okay. Okay, we have a special guest here today to talk to us about blindness. Here from Guiding Hope, give a warm welcome to Felix Bell. Thank you, Principal Lee. So, uh, like he said, I'm here to talk to you about blindness. That's fun, huh? I mean, not... Being blind isn't fun. It's actually very un-fun at times, but you're out of class. That's pretty bitchin'. Some sighted people think that being blind is all about giving up your independence, but that's just not true. I will now give you a quick demo of the two most common... ...cane techniques. Sweeping. And tapping. Whoa! See? This cane saves lives. I got a question. Well, we're not really at the question part. Do you dream? What? Well, I was just wondering if a dude like you can have dreams. That's a very w-woke question. I dream all the time. Both when I'm asleep and awake. But if you're blind, like, can you see things when you dream? Oh, uh, this is a misunderstanding. I-I'm not actually... Dude, you're legit brave. Thanks. You know, some days are harder than others. But I truly believe that when life hands you lemons, well, you can't see them because you're blind. All right. Do you smell pot? Hello? Can we help you with something? Do you know a girl named Keira Shields? What's it to you? Yeah, are you, like, a cop or something? Uh, yeah, I'm a cop. Yeah, the Chicago Police Department is hiring a bunch of blind girls to protect the streets. They'd probably do a better job. Can I have a hit of that? So you ditched the assembly you were supposed to lead? That is badass.It's just some lame talking points about what it's like to be blind. Super accurate. What's it like? Boring. And annoying. Imagine if you could only judge people by their personalities. I wouldn't like anyone. Ding, ding, ding. Is it hard to date? I don't know. I don't do it. Ever? Nah, it's not really my thing. I'm just gonna have a bunch of meaningless sex until I die. So you really can't see? Like, if I go like this... You can't see me? Nope. Do you remember what you look like? I don't think anyone's ever asked me that. No, I-I don't. You don't know what you look like? Mm-mm. I think about what I look like about a thousand times a day. Come here. Stand... here. You're standing in front of the mirror. We're gonna tell you what you look like. I'm obsessed with your hair. It's blondish and really thick. Thanks. I washed it yesterday. And your eyes are green and super sexual. I have sexual eyes? You're seriously so pretty. Okay. Yep, we're done. So, you guys friends with Keira? I heard she goes here. Yeah, she's our girl, but she's been out of school for, like, a week. Wait, she's not at school? Since her boyfriend ghosted, she's been mad depressed. What's going on here? Is that weed? Uh...Uh... it's mine. Uh, these nice girls told me that smoking's super bad for me and my brain. But I refused to listen because I'm dumb. From all the pot. And who are you? Murphy. Hello. Yeah, I'm-I'm, uh, sort of in charge of the assembly. And the assembly is where you two girls are supposed to be. Okay, okay, we're going. Hey, tell Keira I'm looking for her. It's about Tyson. Have her call me. So you gonna give me detention now or what? I have to pretend like I care about stupid stuff like pot-smoking in front of the students. Mm. Do you... have a boyfriend? I do not. It was like a curtain closed. But you know what's weird? Even though I lost my sight, I feel like I gained so much more. Are you ready? Oh.Here. No, over here. Oh. Oh. Is that Mr. Robbins? Get it, Robbins. Oh, dear God. Here. Take this.What? Here, here.Okay. She is my hero. Okay, guys, I know what we just saw was a lot, but let's just try to get back to, uh... I thought you couldn't see. Are you not blind? You were lying? About being blind? No? What a psycho. Say it ain't so I will not go Turn the lights off, carry me home  Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill  The night will go on, my little windmill.  I'm never speaking to you again. Love that you think that's a punishment. Well, what was the plan, by the way? Just bring me here and watch me get humiliated? Like, this is your idea of fun? I didn't even want you to come. My friend died, okay? If this is some weird lie to get me to stop yelling at you...It's not. It's the truth, and I was looking for his girlfriend to try to get some information, but I failed. You-you cannot smoke here. There are teachers around. We're not students, you dork. And you won't let me smoke in your car. Just... God, come with me. Just come with me. Squat. Your friend really died? Yeah. I'm sorry. That sucks. Do you want one? What the hell? I always wanted to go under one of these. Where are we? Under the bleachers. Where the burnouts hang out. What were you like in high school? Oh, I... I didn't go. I just lost my sight. My mom thought I couldn't handle it, so... She homeschooled me. And you thought your high school experience was bad. The only thing worse than being tortured in high school is returning as a grown man and being tortured again. Speaking as someone who tortures you on the reg... ...you make it too easy. You got to start pushing back. Well, how? First of all, stop letting the water guy bully you. I don't get bullied by the water guy. Okay. Okay, fine. I do get bullied by the water guy. Did you really masturbate to the Blink-182 album cover? It was Shania Twain. Doing okay in there, honey? Hey, I-I looked up instructions on how to put in a tampon. I'm just gonna go ahead and read them, okay? Dad, seriously? No."Number one: Wash your hands thoroughly." That's... that's always good advice, tight? Um, "Two: Stand in a... a comfortable position and," says here, "some women prefer to squat," so are you squatting or... standing up? Dad, could you call Murphy? Are you sure? I-I could just call Grandma. Like Grandma still has her period. Dad, just call Murphy. Call Murphy. I'm dizzy. I feel like I'm dying. These things are horrible. Yeah, you get used to it. Come on, Pretzel. Hang on. Incoming call from that cop. Hello? You can't let the dumb girls at school make you feel bad, okay? Period stains are nothing. God, I wish they had made fun of me. They were all super nice, which was way worse. One girl even gave me her jacket to put around my waist. Wait. Wait, that's why you're bummed? You want someone to make fun of you? Yeah. Fine, I'll make fun of you. It's sort of my specialty. Uh, check out this menstruating dork. Her uterine walls are shedding their lining. Man, she's so lame, she probably has a vagina and everything. Yeah. You asked for it. All right, we're here. You need help? Uh, no, I'm good. Thanks, Murphy. Of course, you bleeding loser. You're the bleeding loser. Oh, yeah? Hey, uh, Murphy, did you... did you ever get into that high school? Yeah, I did, but it was a dead end. Well, hey, if you want to, um, call me at the office tomorrow, maybe I can help you. Okay. Thank you. Come on, Pretzel. Come on. What? "Maybe I can help you." Shut up. You like her. Hi. Can I help you?Hey, is Murphy here? She's, uh, in the back.Hang on. Aren't you that crying dude from school that everyone keeps posting pictures of? No, I have no idea what you're talking about, but I'll let Murphy know you're here. What's the name? Keira. What's this? Just a little something to keep you on your feet. D, how much is this? 15 Gs. You don't think he's coming back. That's not what I said. I...$15,000. Is that what you think my son's life is worth? Get out of my house. Take this bag with you. I don't want your damn money. I want my son. So you were Tyson's girlfriend? I was, yeah, until the night he left and totally ghosted me. I don't think that's what happened. I think he was in trouble. Okay, so do you know if anyone was after him? He was not in trouble. He was cheating on me. What?I caught Tyson messaging some chick named Jamie, so I called the number and a girl answered. He's a really sweet kid. The Tyson I know wouldn't do that. Here's the thing about Tyson. He made you think you knew him, but you didn't. No one did. What-what else do you know about this Jamie? Only that she lives in Madison. He snuck out a couple times to go see her. Madison. Yeah. Bet you he's there with her right now. Do you have this Jamie's number? Yeah. Here. Thank you. And if you see Tyson, tell him I said to never, ever text me again. Hey, Fievel. Looks like you've been going through a lot of water lately. Either that or somebody at Guiding Hope has a giant crush on me. Well, most of our clients are blind. What? It was called a dig. And, uh, you-you can just leave the water right there, actually. Today, I'm gonna replace it. You sure? Oh, yeah. I'm gonna replace the water bottles myself from now on, okay? There it is! Say it ain't so, I will not go...  I guess you got it from here. Carry me home Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill  The night will go on, my little windmill.  Hey. I did the laundry, and I found a men's sock. It's Max's. I used it to hold the ice. You can... you can toss it. Murph, it's okay to like someone. It's actually one of the best things in the entire world. You're such a lesbian. Just call him. And say what? Just tell him how you feel. Every time you get a drink That's him walking in. Good luck, Murph. And every time you go to sleep  Hi. Are those dreams inside your head?  Hey. Is there sunlight on your bed?  What's up? And every time you're driving home  You-you left your sock at my house. Way outside your safety zone...  That's why you texted me? Well, I thought maybe you were wondering where it was. Oh, I lost a lot of sleep over it. Well, I was trying to be a good person and return it. Thanks. I appreciate it. You're welcome. So that's it? I slept with some dude yesterday. Oh, cool. I didn't enjoy it, which is, like, a first. Oh, come on, help me out. I'm trying to win you back here. By giving me my old sock and telling me you slept with someone? I've never done this before. What? Like, dated anyone. But I sort of want to try that with you. I think you made a big mistake...  Darnell thinks you're bad news. Maybe I am. But I feel like you might be bad news, too. Oh, I definitely am. Good. You own me Lucky you You own me There's nothing you can do Lucky you. Captioning sponsored by CBS Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH
