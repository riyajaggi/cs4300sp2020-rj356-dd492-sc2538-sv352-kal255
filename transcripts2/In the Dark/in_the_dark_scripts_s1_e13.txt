 Previously on In the Dark... - Tyson. Help! I know Darnell didn't do it. How? - Because he was with me that night. I'm just trying to figure out how we both got popped on the same thing and you got out in, what, an hour. We think whoever killed Tyson sent you and Darnell James those texts remotely. So you can track them and you can figure out who hacked into his account or whatever? Whoever hacked into Tyson's account

 was using their Wi-Fi. I saw someone meeting with Nia. I recognized their gun holster. - We all have the same one. I think the person who's framing you is a cop. - I'm crazy about you. I don't know who it is, but I swear to God, I'm gonna find this son of a bitch. Chicago PD. I'd like to speak with Nia Bailey. Come in. Take off your shoes. Nia. Detective Riley. I'd like to ask you a few questions. You mind?

 Have a seat. Can I get you a drink or something? I'm good. There was a, uh... a shooting at the liquor store on Shields Avenue last Wednesday. Cashier identified the driver as one of your rivals. Rivals? In my dry cleaning business? Honey, my only rivals are washing machines. How you holding up, baby? Excuse me? I mean, if I lost my wife in a car wreck, I don't know if I'd be back to work so soon. That's none of your business. How's your daughter doing? She still in the hospital? How do you know about that? You know, my nephew has bone cancer. I mean, no child should suffer the way he has. And from what I know about the CPD health plan, the surgeries your daughter needs will put you well over your annual limit. Let me guess, you'll pay for the surgery if we drop the case we're building against you. It's never going to happen. It's just a tip here and there. It's nothing major. Nothing will ever trace back to you. You ain't ever gonna talk to anybody. All our transactions go through a locker at the train station. Oh, and... Here's your liquor store shooter. Oh, there's no way. Yeah. No. Listen, I... She wanted to kiss me. I said, "I'm only 12." And then, and then she kissed me, and I was like, "Oh, I get how it works now." No. No, no. Ah. Wait, you are not gonna believe this. What? The, uh, sun is up. Are you serious? Yeah. Here. Oh, my God. Come here. What? Feel that? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I actually can. I can't even believe I'm gonna say this, but... I think the only silver lining about this year is that it led me to you. Wow. I did not know you were such a sap. Shut up! Oh, it's very romantic. Everything you say is very romantic. Fine, I take it back. No. Don't. Can't. ♪ ♪ Since when do you take things slow? I don't know. Since I don't want to mess things up. Unlike stupid Max, Dean might actually be good for me. I just want the first time we have sex to be in, like... a lesbian way. Multiple orgasms? No, shut up. Like... like how you always want it to be special or whatever. You know? Well, you could go away for a romantic weekend. That's a super gay way to do it for the first time. Yeah. No, no, no. Why am I literally the only one who does anything around here while you guys get to just sit around, talking about your sordid love lives and whether you want tacos or poke bowls for lunch? Just work! Please, I'm begging you. Geez. What's with him? I don't know. Probably his period or something. ♪ ♪ You look like you got less sleep than I did. Yeah. Jules? Talk to me. Not here. Let's-let's go outside. Okay, what is going on? There's a dirty cop here. What? Where-where did you hear that? I followed Nia last night. And I saw her talking to one of our own. You saw who she was talking to? I couldn't see his face, but I-I could see his holster. So, s-someone here is in with Nia Bailey? I mean, I-I guess it explains how she got off. Or how Darnell was framed. Wait, you... Are you thinking that Nia told this cop to frame Darnell for Parker's murder? I don't think Nia would want to put Darnell away. He's one of her best guys. I'm just... I'm wondering if this dirty cop might be covering for himself. Obviously, whoever it was, if he had time to meet with Nia, then he wasn't... working last night. I'm gonna check the logs. Sorry, you're just... you're blowing my mind a little here. Uh... Okay. All right, well, look, we're gonna have to keep our eyes peeled, see what we can see. Um... in the meantime, Chloe has a-a half-day from school. So may-maybe we can all get lunch. It's my treat. Yeah. Sure. Okay. Hey. We need to talk. Okay. Oh, God. I feel like I'm gonna be physically ill. Dude, what is going on? Okay, you cannot tell anyone. I have to close Guiding Hope. Hang on. Is this just you being dramatic? I inherited so much debt, and I just couldn't crawl out of it, especially once my mother cut me off. Okay, how much debt? Oh, $75,000. What? Holy... That's a lot. So that's it? Guiding Hope is, like... done? Yeah. Hey, Chloe. It's Jules. Oh, hey. How are you? You good? Fine. Just working on math homework. What's the point? My phone literally does everything. Your dad got off early last night. You guys do anything fun? Yeah, we went roller-skating. Roller-skating. I should take my niece. Where'd you guys go? Uh, Scooters. Hey! Hi. We were, uh... We were just about to leave for lunch. Still want to come with us? No. I-I think I'm just gonna stay here. I got a lot of work to do. Sure? Yeah. Bye, Chlo. You should totally take your niece roller-skating. It was really fun. Will do. How did, uh, how did roller-skating come up? She was just asking what we did last night, 'cause you had the night off. - Murphy, answer the phone! - I was gonna! Guiding Hope. Murphy, don't hang up. Darnell? What do you want? You get five minutes. Did you get my letter? You sent me a letter? Look, I was framed. There is a dirty cop who's working for Nia. What are you talking about? That's how my DNA was planted in Tyson's car. Murphy, you know me. I didn't do this. And I really need you to help me figure out who did. Please. I don't know you. I knew Tyson. And I hope... you rot in there. Hey. Um, Darnell said he sent me a letter. But I FaceTimed Jess, and she said it isn't here. Do you remember seeing-seeing anything when you-you, like, picked up my mail the other day? Uh, no, I don't think so. So, hey, wait, why did you talk to Darnell? I don't know. Um, I thought confronting him would make me feel better. I just c... I... I don't know. He said that there's a dirty cop that framed him. Is that... Is that a thing? Is that possible? When someone is guilty, they're gonna say and do anything they can to convince you otherwise. Murphy, Darnell is lying. Yeah. No, you're right, you're right. I just got to get out of my head. Maybe we could get out of town this weekend. That would be perfect. Yeah. Okay. I'll see you soon. Bye. Bye. Hey, where's Becker? She took off a couple hours ago. She say where? No. You have reached Detective Becker. Please leave a message. Well, how you been? How's Chloe? Everyone's good. It's late. What's going on? Well, I, uh, I... I thought I should tell you that... someone is coming... for you. And... it's not easy for me to tell you who, because... Who? It's my partner. Jules Becker. And... she's got enough on you to put you away for a very long time. A cop? That's a tough one. Oh, I know, but... look, I'm just looking out for you, 'cause that was our deal. Right? Right. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. You hungry? I made meat loaf. Let me warm you up a plate. How did I let this happen? I love Guiding Hope, and I ran it into the ground. I am a total and complete failure. Felix, I have an idea. There are no more ideas, Jess. Stop. We must accept reality now. Felix, shh. Shh. Would you just shut up for, like, two seconds, please? I think I know where we can get some money. ("My Sharona" by The Knack playing) Oh, my God, I'm feeling so much better already. Me, too. This was a great idea. You can thank Jess. Ooh, I love this song. ♪ Ooh, my little pretty one ♪ ♪ My pretty one ♪ ♪ When you gonna give me some ♪ ♪ Time, Sharona ♪ ♪ When you make my motor run ♪ I appreciate you coming in on that. What is it? ♪ Line, Sharona, I don't know all of those words ♪ ♪ To this song, but I don't care ♪ ♪ Time... ♪ ♪ 'Cause I am in ♪ ♪ The car... ♪ You don't even know it! ♪ Time ♪ ♪ Sharona ♪ ♪ My, my, yi, whoo! ♪ ♪ M-M-M-My Sharona... ♪ You want to eat inside, or...? Still a few hours away. Let's just eat on the road. I will... run in. What do you want? Mm... surprise me. I trust you. Okay. Be right back. Where are we going? It should be around here somewhere. Murphy said it's next to Starshine Lake. We're taking directions from Murphy? Also, why are we going to Starshine Lake? What kind of lake name is that, anyway? Actually, it's kind of nice. Oh, my God, wait, stop. Why? Felix, stop the car! Look. Do you see that? Do you see that? That's Max's truck. Come on. W-Wait, no, it's freezing, and all I have is a windbreaker. Well, here's Joy's jacket. Put that on. Absolutely not. Come on. Can you please tell me what we are doing? Why are we looking for Max's truck? Okay, do you remember when Max took Murphy to that lake house? Yeah? Uh-huh. Well, um, she told me that he hid $100,000 there. Oh. Um, why did Max have 100 grand in cash? Because he's a money launderer. You know, for-for drug dealers. Wait, what? Jess. I'm not taking a drug dealer's money. Why didn't you tell me this before? 'Cause I knew you wouldn't take a drug dealer's money. This was your master plan? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Felix, come on, we don't have... We don't have any other choice. This may come as a shock... but I love Guiding Hope, too, okay? I get to go to work with my best friend... my best friends every day. And I'm not ready... I'm not ready to let that go. Well, neither am I. Felix, listen, if we get this money, we could make a donation, and then we're good. Jess... What? You can't just make a donation of $100,000. That kind of raises some flags with the IRS. You'd have to break it up into smaller amounts and make smaller donations over a much longer period of time. Which could work. That could work. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. So, Murphy told me that Max dumped the truck here, huh, and then they got in a boat and went to the other side of the lake, so... Hey. Are we doing this? I think we're doing this. Okay. You look really pretty. Shut up. Come on. This is so exciting! Call from Jules Becker. I can't talk right now. I just need to ask you a question. When Dean left the roller rink the other night, did he tell you where he was going? Yeah. He just said he was meeting you. I don't know. No, he wasn't. He said that? Yeah. He said he... he said he was gonna... he had to do a report or... or he said he... he said you needed his help with something. Or... I-I'm confused. What... Murphy, what exactly are you saying? He said he was meeting you. That's what he told me. I don't... What... Did he not... Jules? Hello? Okay. Fine. Bye, I guess. ♪ ♪ Oh, thank God. Whoever hacked into Tyson's account was using their Wi-Fi. Hey. So, I went basic: burgers and fries and vanilla milkshakes. Uh, you gonna smoke? Oh. I was. Just... I was just gonna have... just one. Yeah, just, uh, not in the car, maybe. Because I don't want it to smell bad for Chloe. Yeah. That's okay. Uh, just wait till we get up there? Yeah. Sure, that's fine. All right, I'll trade you. Here. Um, here you go. Thank you. Good? It's really good. Thank you. Okay, so this has to be it, because this is the only house for, like, miles. Okay. Where's the money? Uh, Murphy said he hid it somewhere outside. Cool. That narrows it down. Max took Murphy to this dump? Well, it wasn't, like, a romantic getaway. It was more like an... abduction. Learning a lot about Max today. Yeah? You find the money? Not yet, but two other people just showed up. Two people? Who? Some kids in a van with a dog on it. Says "Guiding Hope." That's where Murphy Mason works. Keep an eye on them. They might know where the money is. And we are finally here. Oh. It's even nicer than the pictures. Oh, that's... that's cool. It's really quiet. I know. It's perfect. I think I've seen this tree before. No. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What are you doing? I'm sitting. This is my rock bottom. I can't feel any part of my body. I'm cross-dressing. I'm so hungry and parched. And all of this to find drug money? To save my failed business? Jess... what have I become? Shut up. What is that? Wha...? Why have we not seen this before? We've literally walked by this, like, a hundred times. Okay. Thank you so much for helping, Felix. Okay, I don't have gloves, unlike some people. Okay. Whoa. Whoa.

It was. We're both pretty messed up, aren't we? What? I know what you did. I know it was you. Murphy, what are you... talking about? You don't have to lie anymore. I know. I know you killed Tyson. Darnell told me there's a, um... dirty cop working for Nia, and I know it's you. This is why I didn't want you to talk to Darnell. 'Cause they're just trying to manipulate... Stop. Stop. Those matches I found in your car... were from Birdcliff Coffee Bar, where you sent those texts from Tyson's phone. You stole Darnell's letter from my apartment. Then I smelled your cigar. It's the same exact smell as when I found Tyson that night. Murphy... And the thing is, for some insane reason... I still want to be with you. I'm just finally happy, and I... I don't want to lose that. I hate myself. I hate myself. Oh, my God. I know that the reason you didn't tell anyone is because... if anyone found out, you'd lose Chloe and she wouldn't have anyone, and... But, Dean, you have to tell me why you killed him. You're the only one who can give me closure. And you owe me that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm sorry. It's okay. Was it Nia? No. No, no, she would kill me if she ever found out. We were never supposed to cross paths. Tyson was late making his drop. That's how Nia paid me. I would give her a tip here and there, and... she would help me with Chloe's medical expenses. I knew he was one of Nia's guys. And, after that, he knew that I was one, too. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. And then he got into trouble. Just keep your mouth shut, all right? Worst case, we'll be out in a couple months. A couple months? Wesley, you're up. Well, this is not ideal, huh? Look, I don't want any trouble, okay? What's your name? Tyson Parker. What are you in for? Possession. My mom's gonna kill me. Well, how 'bout I put in a word with the arresting officer and we'll see if we can't get you out of here tonight. Are you serious? That-that would be amazing. Okay. Just to be clear, you've never seen me before, right? Yeah. Right. Good. Sit tight, Tyson Parker. But, two months later, Wesley got out of jail. Hey. Thanks for coming. The hell are you thinking? You cannot call and ask for me. I can't call anybody else. My dad just turned me away, and I'm not bringing my mom into this. I thought I made it very clear. You and I do not know each other. Look, he is going to kill me, okay? Who? Wesley thinks that I got out so quick because I rolled on him. He thinks I'm a snitch, but I'm not. Can't you at least, like, tell him the real reason I got out? No one knows that I am working with Nia. No one can know that I am working with Nia. He's gonna kill me, all right? I... This is no joke. I am sorry. I can't. Okay, then I'll tell him the real reason I got out. I'll tell him everything about you. What did you just say? Hey, where are you going? To go tell Wesley the truth. Do you understand what is at stake for me here? I don't care, man. I care. Hey, hey, hey. Get off of me. I care. Get off me! Hey! Help! Shut up! Shut up. Stop. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Tyson, you here? Ty? Come on, what's wrong with you? Go. Tyson! Help! Somebody help! Help! Pretzel, come on. Help! Somebody help! Ow. W-Wait. Wait. Wait! Wait! Wait, Dean! No! Please! Somebody help! Somebody help! Murphy. Just please say something. Never tell anyone what you just told me. So you understand? You did it for Chloe. Everything I do is for Chloe. I know. It's okay. ♪ ♪ Stop recording. Stopping recording. Everything okay in there? Yeah, just a second. Where are you going? Let's talk about this. No! Help! Help! Stop screaming. ♪ ♪ Delete all recordings. Deleting recordings. This can't get out, you know that. This... It can't. I know that you care about me. We just made love. That's the thing. Sex means nothing to me. I just use it to get what I want. And I did. How can you do that to me? Yeah. You're the victim here. Think about Chloe. The fact that I have a family; I have a life. You should have thought about that before you murdered a kid. He had a family. He had a life. And you took that away from him. He brought it on himself. Okay, it's his fault. It's not just mine. He threatened me. And now I'm threatening you. Are you gonna kill me, too? Just keep silencing everybody? What makes you think your life is so important? There's nothing special about you. Nothing. Wait. Murphy, the car is moving. I don't care. Stop! I'm sorry. Hey. Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Murphy, I'm-I'm sorry. Please. Ju... Stop! Don't make me do this. What am I making you do? What am I making you do? What am I making you do?! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ I like it. Who is this? Labi Siffre. Who? Labi Siffre. Not a lot of people know who he is, but he influenced, like, everybody. This is the kind of guy that I want to be when I grow up. You want to influence everybody?

I don't want to tell you what a bad person you are. ♪ You are ♪ ♪ I'm still falling ♪ I want to talk about what a good person he was. So you're gonna lie there and listen to every single thing I can remember about him. Every single thing I couldn't even think about, because I was so obsessed... with finding you. ♪ ♪ Hi, Murphy. It's Nia. Oh. Hello. Look like your work friends stole my money. What? Your coworkers. Oh, my God. Jess. Oh, my God. Um... They have nothing to do with this. I will find a way to pay you back. I'm sorry, but... Oh, I don't want you to pay it back. It's a gift. W-What do you mean? Actually, it's not a gift. It's an investment. See, when your boyfriend ran off, I lost one of my fronts. And I've been in need of a replacement, and then poof. God brought me Guiding Hope. You want us to launder money for you? I don't... That's not a good idea. It's a win-win. You keep your company, I keep mine. I've very lucrative. What do you say? Um, thank you, that's a-a nice offer, but... unfortunately, there's no way Felix or Jess would... No, they're in; they were in when they stole my money. Unless you're planning on paying me back right now, this negotiation is over. I'll see you soon, Murphy. What is this? What is it?
