 Feel the textures of my beauty. Previously on In The Dark... Oh, my God. Tyson. Help! So what were you doing in the alley? We were friends. I'm his father. I found Tyson lying dead. No, that's impossible. What I do know is that he skipped town for good. Quit his job at the flower shop, sold his stuff and everything.

 I've never done this before. What?Dated anyone. But I sort of want to try that with you. Tyson witnessed the Crawford murder, and you didn't tell me. You know we got to keep work out of this. It's better for both of us. Yeah. Are you hungry again?Always. Can you open this? Yeah. Here. Thank you. Oh, God, don't eat that. That expired, like, a week ago. Tastes good, like a fine wine. Is that how you stay so thin? Eat rotting food?

 You know, Tyson's dad said he talked to Tyson a couple days ago, but... I know I felt him in the alley. It... It doesn't make sense. Also not making sense, Tyson worked at a flower shop? Exactly. Like, what flower shop? Like... when? Why? Dude, you're asking me like I know the answers to these questions. Oh, tampons. I need tampons. And so do you, actually, because I used your last one this morning, sorry. Super plus. How do you wear these things? It feels like I have a tiny penis inside of me. Wait, we're not on our periods yet. I am. I'm, like, two days in. Oh, God. Are you late? Please don't tell me you're late. It's probably stress.Murphy... I've taken so many morning-after pills, if I'm not infertile by this point, I'm suing them. We can't have a baby. I can feel the blood brewing in me. Okay? I've been late before. It's nothing. Come on. I'm so lucky I don't have to deal with this whole pregnancy scare stuff. Thank you for flaunting your gay privilege. Anytime. Hey, Chels, can you top me off? Of course. How's it, uh, how's it going with the tech guy? Uh, okay. I mean, I haven't heard from him in, like, a week. He was really busy, and then his sister was in town... Oh, sweet Chelsea. He's boning somebody else, isn't he? He's definitely boning someone else. Cool. Should I just kill myself now, or...? Who's gonna pour me my drinks? Oh, that's right. I'll live for you. Hey, Chelsea. I'm gonna go pour this guy his drink. Hey. It's Dean. Kind of I thought I might find you here. Really using those detective skills. Hey, I got your message about Tyson's dad. About how I'm doing your job ten times better than you are. Actually, I came to tell you that I have a lead. So, no, you're not. A lead? Yeah. A, uh, rival dealer was shot, and Tyson was there. You think this rival drug dealer killed Tyson? No, I-- Based on what you told me about Tyson's dad, I think maybe this dealer's people drove Tyson out of town. Oh. Hey. Can I get you a drink? Uh, yeah, sure. I'll have a... a beer. We have, like, 50. Oh. Okay. Yeah, he's, uh, he's not much of a drinker. Oh... I drink. I'll, uh, have a... No, wait. Don't. Let me pick. I'm, like, really good at this. Okay.Okay. That's exciting. Okay. This is a local brew, double IPA. It's my personal favorite. Ooh. Mmm. That is tasty. Oh, you hate it. He hates it. He hates it. No, no, no, no. I love it. Truly. Thank you. Okay. I'll be right back. So, you want to do it? Excuse me? Chelsea, the bartender. I can totally make that happen. No, I, uh... If you want. If you're down. I'm good. But, um... you know, I'm hungry. You want to get a bite? Hi, babe. Right now? Hey. Sorry. Uh, Dean, this is my... boyfriend. It's still hard for her to say. A little bit. Oh, I'm Max. It's nice to meet you. Yeah. You, too. Ready to go? Yeah. Will you let me know if you find out anything else? Yeah.Okay. All right. See you. Yeah. What is this? It's a Shirley Temple. It's more your speed. Really, really tired. I'll be quick. Come on, come on. it'll only take, like, five.... Oh, that's a ringing endorsement. All right. Okay. Okay, good night. I'll go to sleep. Good night. Is there blood? I think we might be too close. This isn't even weird. Well, is there blood? Nothing. Do my boobs look bigger? Feel them. Okay, that's where I draw the line. Do my boobs look bigger. Be a grown up. Take a test. Be a grown-up. Take a test. You just refuse to look because they're better than Vanessa's! No, they're not. Bitch. You're short 15K. That's almost half your haul. I know. I've got it handled. You know, you've been off your game since that cousin of yours went missing. Would you care to explain to me why your money boy is running around with that blind girl? They were hooking up. I thought it ended a couple weeks ago. Well, it didn't. I might be in here, but that don't mean I ain't got eyes out there. I'm looking at 20 years if they pin me for racketeering. The last thing I want is somebody poking around in my business while I'm waiting on my trial date. So take care of it. Yeah. Look at me! Take care of it. I got it. All right. Oh, by the way, I gave Wesley a few blocks to try him out these past couple weeks. Wesley? You got to be kidding me. He's a loose cannon. Kid's not serious. He's moving major product. He's a good soldier. You know, if I were you, I'd step it up, Darnell. On all fronts. "Clover Flora." No. How many flower shops can there possibly be? Shh. I'm Yelping. Incoming call from Max. I take it that you're not telling baby daddy what's going on? Murphy, I don't understand why you refuse to take a test. Because I'm not going to. I'm barely late, okay? Drop it. Okay. Company time. Company computer. Is this company work? Is this the company loser? Rules are rules. Okay? Are you okay? You're cracking a lot more than usual. Knuckles or neck? Knuckles. Gross. Guys, I'm right here. And if you must know, my Uncle Ralph is in hospice at my mom's house, and he's getting worse. So, he only has a couple days, if we're lucky, so I'm driving up to Winnetka tonight. Oh, Felix, I'm so sorry. It is what it is. I'm walking out the front now, so wait at least 20 minutes. D? You good? Huh? Uh, yeah, yeah. Just... Ugh, I thought I was done sneaking out of girls' houses at 15. Whose house were you sneaking out of at 15? Chantal Williams. What?She's gay. Oh, there you go. You did have a delicate frame back then. Come on, I'm serious. What if we... drove out some place nobody knows us? We could go to dinner. I could actually hold your hand in public. Hold hands? Yeah. Is that how far you got with Chantal Williams? Let me take you out. I could use a distraction. Yeah, okay. All right, uh... I have a good feeling about this one. Well, you said that about the last three places. I'm trying to remain positive. Honestly, I don't even get the whole flower thing. They die after two days, and then they just smell like vomit. Well, they're pretty. Vanessa loves them. Yeah, she's also the most basic person I've ever met in my life. Can I help you guys? Yes. Hi, we were wondering if anyone named Tyson Parker used to work here. Tyson? Beanie kid. Yes. So he did work here? He did, yeah. Why? Oh, um... I-I'm looking for him. Well, uh, I haven't seen him lately. He stopped showing up a couple weeks ago. Okay, um... Well, do you know anything about him being, like, scared of someone, or running away, or anything? Uh... he just delivered flowers for me. We didn't get that deep. Okay. Uh, do you. I have a customer. Unless you guys are gonna buy something. Oh, no. Yes. Uh, do you have any dahlias? They're my girlfriend's favorite. Over here. Oh, God. Okay. All right, so, uh... well, what-what do we do now? I mean, maybe what Dean said is true, and some rival drug dealer or something scared Tyson out of town. I don't know. Right, which would mean he was unconscious when you found him in the alley, and then he just came to and took off? Maybe. I don't know. I just know he felt, like, so dead. Well, you don't know what a dead person feels like. I mean, it's not like you've felt any other dead people. Yeah. Wait, that's it.What? You're right, I need to feel another dead body. Okay. This place better be nice. These heels are killing me. You look beautiful. Just wait till you taste their lasagna bolognese. Ah... I got us a hotel room, too. Look at you. You're really doing it up. And you don't look so bad yourself. Hang on one sec, baby. We got a tip.Hello? The cops are busting our spot on Carver tonight. Hang on, hang on, hang on. Yeah. This is unbelievable. I can't pretend I didn't just hear that. You have to. You need to drop me off right here. I can't, all right? We're on the highway. Darnell!A'ight, a'ight. You make it easy... To love you. Jules... I'm sorry, Jules. Darnell, drive away. So, D, I have a plan. Oh, yeah? And what's that? Okay, see this neighborhood? Mm-hmm. See that new juice store that just opened up? All they sell is juice. And that's it. New people are moving in, and they want something different. Something you gonna have to live with... I was thinking we could give that to them. Know I got it for you if you ever need it... Nah, man. If we start getting into new stuff, finding new suppliers we don't know if we can trust... it's not doable. Starting off a new day... All right. I like where your head's at, though. That kind of thinking will get you somewhere, huh? So I called the morgue to see if I could, uh, feel a dead person. Guess what they said? Hmm. I'm gonna, uh, go out on a limb here and say "No." Yes, they said no, but how-how am I gonna get my hands on a dead body? Hey, don't. I hate when you guys do that. Stop it.Okay, um, why do you want to molest a cadaver? Because she's, uh, crazy. Yeah, I know, but seriously, why? No. Just don't worry about it. It's a long story. Yeah. Oh, hang on. Oh, it's Felix. Hang on, we'll, we'll, you know, talk about this later. Hello? Chels, can I get some wings? You don't actually eat those, do you? Yeah. You know that all we have back there is a cooler and a microwave, right? Yeah. Gross. All right, okay, yep. Okay, bye-bye. That was Felix. He needs me to open up Guiding Hope next week for him. Sounds like his uncle is not even gonna last the night. That really sucks.Yeah. No. Thisis where Felix grew up? Hi. W-What are you doing here? We came to see how you're doing. Really? Why? Because we're your friends. Duh. Oh. Yeah, we, uh, we didn't finish them all, so we thought you might be hungry. Okay, well, thank you for the horrible-looking chicken. Felix? Oh, and it's my mother. Perfect.Who's there? Oh, Mrs. Felix. Hi. We're from Felix's work.Hi. You must be Murphy. It's so good to finally meet you. And that would make you Jess. Yes. I'm Kathy. Hi. You know who we are? Sassy Murphy and her bestie Jess. Sounds about right. It's about time Felix's friends came around. You know, we were beginning to think you didn't exist. You know, that would be like ninth grade all over again, huh? Okay. I think they have to go. No, no, no. We, uh... Not at all. We're here for you, Fee. We-we wanted to come by and just see how Uncle Randy was doing... Ralph.Uncle Ra-Ralph was doing. Yeah. You two are so sweet. You know, with my son and daughter out of town, we could use the company. Well, your other son's standing right next to you, but whatever, and no, they don't want to stay. We'd love to stay. Thanks, Kath, you're a peach. Wonderful. Let me show you around. Excellent. Come on. Thank you. Smells nice. There's no blood? Noth-- are you sure? No. No blood. I didn't realize Felix was rich. Like, how rich? Rich. Like, really rich. You know, he literally made me pay him back six bucks for my ham sandwich yesterday? Look at this. Oh, my God. I broke-- ooh. He's the actual worst. Like, this could go everywhere. God, why isn't his uncle dead yet? It's Felix, Felix, Felix. Hey. Hey, Felix. Hey. Just so you know, I don't talk about you guys that much. Kathy likes to exaggerate. Hey, Richie Rich, I want my six bucks back.I'm not rich. My parents are, and I refuse to take a dime from them. I'll take their dimes. Hey, so, uh, just want to say, it's super weird that you're here. Yeah, I know. Uh, we, uh... I mean, it was all Jess. She wouldn't shut up about how sad you looked at work, and I naturally made fun of you, which was rude, and she was like, "You know, you shouldn't be a dick, we should be there for him." Yeah, I wanted to make sure that you were okay. Wow. I guess it's times like these you find out who really cares about you. Felix, it's time. It's time. Murph, what is going on? You've been ignoring me all day. Just call me, okay? Please. Who was that? No one. I thought you said it was over between you and Murphy. And you said that I wouldn't have anything to do besides clean some money. What the hell are we doing, all right? This isn't what I signed up for. We'll be done in a bit, but you're done with Murphy starting now. That's not up to you, man. Now, why are we using this nervous white boy's truck anyway? Come on, Wesley. Who you think the cops are gonna stop? My ride or this weird-ass truck? Use your brain. Where we dropping this stuff? There's an old spot we used to use over off Grand. W-Wait a minute. Why can't we just use your crib so we know it won't get jacked? 'Cause I'm not stupid enough to have a bunch of product on me, Wesley. Man, I can see why Nia thinks you're such a little bitch. Move. His heartbeat's fading. It's okay, Ralphy, you can let go. Oh, my God, I think this is it. It's happening. Good-bye, Uncle Ralph. What?I don't know. What was that? I don't know. What the hell was that? I don't know.What happened? Oh, Felix, hey.Hey. Felix, I'm so sorry.  Is he gone? Oh, he got a second wind. The nurse thinks he's gonna make it till tomorrow. Oh, my God, that's great. Yeah. Thank the good Lord. Yeah. Okay, we need to leave soon because we can't stay here all night. Oh, come on. I bet the thread count on the sheets is off the chain. Text from Max. Okay, do you know how much it sucks when the person you're dating ignores you? Hi, Kathy. Hello, Jess. I love it here. You know, while Felix is still upstairs, may I say, it's so nice of you two to come. Aw. Aw. Are we, like, the first girls that Felix has ever brought home? No, girls were his brother's domain. Felix wasn't good at much. Hmm. Hey.Mm. Fee, your sister sent over some chocolates, isn't that nice? Go ahead, read the card. "Good-bye, Uncle Ralph. Sad face. Love, Lesley." How touching. What do you expect her to write, an essay? She's on partner track, it's very demanding. You know, actually, Felix works really hard, too. Jess, don't.Yes, yes, I know. He's always telling me how busy it is over at the pet store. It's actually not a pet store. It's a major nonprofit that provides service animals to over 500 people every year, myself included. Hmm. Jules. Ooh, what's with the face? Oh... Family thing. Where is everybody? They are on their way to raid the trap house on Carver. Carver? I thought they were waiting till after midnight. They got a call that it was being cleaned out early. Took the TAC team and everything. TAC team? That's aggressive. Could get ugly. Okay. I got to run. Uh, have a good night. Don't stay too late. Yeah. Damn it. Hey. Hey. Murphy's not here. Actually, I, uh, came here to see you. Really? Yeah. Uh... You want to hang out sometime? With me? Like, uh... I'm-I'm sorry, Officer, are you trying to ask me out? Yes. Sorry. It's my first time doing this since my wife died. Okay, I'm gonna stop talking now. I get off in an hour. Okay. Cool. Cool. See you later. You know, I'm sort of digging this whole bitter thing you got going with your mom. Gives you an edge. I'm so nice to her, and she treats me like garbage. Then she bronzes my brother and sister's turds. Oh, I know why you're nice to her. Yeah. My therapist says it's because I'm desperate for the attention of strong female figures I never got as a child. Oh, I was gonna say it's because you love her, but... It's just... my mom was never much of a mom. My dad was always off working. Our nannies... Nannies, plural? Wow. Continue. My nannies-- I don't know-- were just... I always felt like I was their job, and I was. Uncle Ralph's, like, the only person in my family who I've thought really cared about me. Aw, Felix. It's super sad, right? Yeah. Dude, you're, like, the saddest, richest kid in all of Chicago. We're empty. Let's open up a Rothschild and really piss Kathy off. I love that that's your idea of rebellion. The Bordeaux glasses are upstairs. I'll be right back. Murphy, this has gone way past the point of a casual visit. I feel so bad. This is so wrong. Maybe it's because I'm drunk, but I'm actually not hating his company for once. Yeah, here's a crazy thought, maybe you shouldn't be drinking right now. Oh, would you stop it? Murphy, wha... Come on, let's go. No! Why? Because when am I gonna get the chance to feel another dead body? Are you listening to the words... The reason you're here is because you want to feel a dead body? Oh, God. Just get out of my house. Hang on. Felix... Leave! Now! Well, this sucks. You are so focused on being a good friend to Tyson that you are completely oblivious how awful you are being to everyone else. Okay, Jess. Cool. Yeah, but, "Cool, cool, Jess," that's all you ever have to say. Calling an Uber. Calling Uber.I am not like you! I can't... I can't go and-and feel a dead body like it's nothing, and I can't hurt someone like it's nothing, and I most certainly can't just ignore my boyfriend when I might be-be carrying his baby. I'm gonna go apologize to Felix. And, no, I'm not ignoring Max or the fact that I might be carrying some stupid baby inside of me. That's actually all I've been thinking about all day. 'Cause you know what? I cannot even imagine the idea of passing on these messed-up genes to anyone else! Murphy, your genes aren't messed up. I wasn't talking about being blind. What? Sorry that I'm such a dick, Felix. Is everyone happy? I came home...  Come on. In the middle of the night My father says "What you gonna do with your life?" Well, daddy dear You're still number one... Please work. Oh, girls They want to have fun... Do not screen me right now. The phone rings In the middle of the night My mother says... Call Max. Calling Max. Well, mother dear We're not the fortunate ones... There you are. Hey. Is everything okay? Yeah. Um... Do you want to come over? Yeah, I can, uh, I can be there in an hour. Great. Hey, you-you sure you're okay? Where have you been all day? Yeah, I was-- I'm fine. I was trying to find the flower shop Tyson worked at. Did you find it? Yeah. He did deliveries for this place called Clover Flora or something. Really? Yeah, you know it? I, uh, yeah, I-I know a guy that buys his Molly from Clover Flora. I'm pretty sure it's a front. Wait, wait, wait. That, um... You think that place is a drug front? Pretty sure. Okay, Max, I got to go. Sorry. Murph... Okay. We got to bounce, now. Hey, hold up, man, we still got half our stash left. Cops are gonna be here any minute. We can take them. All right, we're armed. Man, we can't leave all that product.What? No. No, we can't take them, Wesley, all right? I'm not dying here tonight. Don't be such a bitch, man. You think you're a hot shot? You ain't nothing but a small-time runner who had a good couple of weeks. And you're just an old man who can't keep up. I get it. You're Nia's little lapdog, but I run things. Max, drive. Felix. I'm so sorry. Apology accepted. You can leave. I don't feel like you actually accepted my apology. Honestly, you're pretty low on the list of things upsetting me right now, okay? Great, now my knife is dirty. I'll... No, I got it. Okay. Okay, it's okay. Everything is falling apart. I'm gonna make this for you. No, I'm fine. I got it, okay? Felix? What? You are sad, and that's okay, but I'm-I'm gonna make you food because that's-that's what I do. Okay? Okay. No cheese, though, 'cause I have a lactose thing. Oh, okay. And easy on the lettuce. I'm allergic to mayo, so... Just... Thank you. Come here. Come here. You're gonna be okay. That can't happen again. I don't want you using my truck for this. Who do you think pays for this thing? I clean your money. That doesn't mean you own my time or my truck or anything else about my life. I'm sorry you got it bad for Murphy, but it's over. I'm not playing. There are people above me calling the shots. You need to walk away. I can't do that. And if you were in my position, you'd say the same thing. As far as I know, you guys don't talk. We clear? Done. Hey, man. What up? Talk to your people? Yeah, they're-they're good. Oh, really? Yeah. Darnell said I could work for you on the side, no problem. No problem? Yeah. We're operating on different territory. It's a different business. All right. Welcome aboard. Hello? Oh, you. We're closing. Sell any drugs today? I don't know what you're talking about, lady. This is a flower shop. So, look, I know this is a front, and I also know that Tyson used to sell drugs for you. Okay? So what I want is for you to tell me exactly... Oh, thank God. Can I use your bathroom, please? No. Employees only. Okay, well, I just started my period. My beautiful, beautiful-- thank God-- sweet, beautiful period. So if you don't want blood on your floor... Open camera. Send to Jess. New text from Jess. "Congratulations." Uh, reply: "I'm sorry about today. I love you more than the baby I almost had." Send. New text from Jess. "I love you, too, idiot." Hell yeah. You know, I honestly don't know what we did to deserve this break, Pretzel, but you're gonna remain an only child. And I am going to look into an IUD, because we are never doing this again. Whoa, whoa, what the hell? You stole our spot, now give me your stash! No! Get off! Don't smash the-- hey! I said give me your stash, now! Come on, boy. Come on. Come on, come on. Pretzel. Pretzel, come on. Up, up. Pretzel wants up? Shh. Hello? Hello? Find outside, Pretzel. Find outside. Pretzel, go forward. Forward, Pretzel. Forward, Pretzel. Go, Pretzel, forward. Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? You okay? Hello? Call 911. Calling 911. 911, please hold. Hold? When I met you, I thought you were crushing on Murphy. No. Murphy and I are friends. You're not, like, secretly married, right? Not that I'm aware of, no. Are you addicted to weird porn? Uh...Are you a serial killer? I mean, you can-- I can take it, come on. What's wrong with you? You know, I, uh... I don't floss. And I, uh, I lie to my dentist when she asks, so... You're disgusting. I want out. What are you doing? I don't know. I do not need to answer this. It's fine. You guys are friends. Just... see what she wants. Hello, Murphy. What's happening? Dean, I think someone got shot. What? Where are you? At some flower shop. It's called Clover Flora. Is he still breathing? I can't tell if he's breathing, I... I just felt all this blood, I don't-I don't... I'm gonna call an ambulance. It's gonna be fine. Try not to panic, but you need t-to see if he's still breathing. Uh, feel for a pulse. He's dead. He's definitely, definitely dead. All right, look, I'm on my way. I'm sorry, I... No, no. It sounds like you've got to go. Sorry. I'm lonely too... What's that song... Thank you. Come on, Jules. You know I didn't plan that. I know you're a criminal, and I know I helped you. I didn't ask you to do that. What was my alternative, hear you died in a shootout? I can take care of myself. You put me in an impossible position. And what really scares me is I didn't even hesitate. You think this doesn't scare me, too? Do you know what would happen to me if Nia found out I was in with a cop? I wish I didn't love you. But I do, and I have since I was 14. You're not alone... So here we are. Every tear... Here we are. I picked up that lasagna bolognese. Tastes the same... A broken dream A broken heart Isolated And afraid Open up, this is a raid... So... Get some rest. We can deal with everything else in the morning. You're not alone... Okay. An open hand An open heart There's no need To be afraid Open up, this is... Murphy, what the hell? It's okay. I'm okay. You're not alone... I'm gonna head out. Uh... Thanks for bringing her home. Through to you... Thank you. Of course. I'm gonna get it through to you You're not alone. Here's more tea. I'm telling you, this guy felt different than Tyson. I knew he was dead the moment I felt him. His face was, like, tense and colder. A lot colder. And Tyson was outside in the freezing weather. So you're saying...? I think he was alive in the alley and then ran away. Whoa. I mean, it makes sense why they didn't find his body, you know? And wherever he is, he doesn't want to be found, but... I think, I think maybe he's okay. What do you think's inside here, man? I don't know, man, but this is heavy. Captioning sponsored by CBS Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH
