 - Previously on In the Dark... - Oh, my God. Tyson. I'm gonna figure out who killed Tyson. There was some DNA. Darnell James. I'm an informant, Murphy. You're the reason Tyson is dead. We can't protect you unless you hold up your end of the bargain. So just stay in town and act normal until Nia's trial. Food truck guy was the snitch?

 Send him my best. Here's your stuff. Damn it. He's gonna kill me, Murphy. What are you doing with my phone? Did you just throw my phone out the window? You're breaking into someone's house? Who cares? You're so great. Run, Pretzel. Come on, this way. We have to hide. He's gonna find us. Row. Now. What are you doing? Just row. No.

 Just row. Do you ever feel lonely? How could I? You never leave me alone. Well, it's kind of like, you're my favorite person to talk to, so... See? How could I ever get lonely, then? You can't see. Well, thank you. That's very cheerful. Okay. Funny thing is, when I'm by myself, I feel fine. It's when I'm around other people I... I kind of feel lonely. Does that include me? What do you think? Yeah. Cool. Hello? Hello? Hello! Help! Oh, come on. Come on. No. Come on. Help! Hello! Help! Forward. Damn it, Max. "Here, just give me your phone, "and I'll just throw it out the window so no one can find you or save you." You think he's still alive? Damn it. God. Find the road, Pretzel. I'm starving. Where'd you go? If I find out... there's a strip mall, like, right over there, I'm gonna be so pissed. How you doing? You okay? I bet it's times like these you wonder why you even signed up for this gig, you know? You could be chasing squirrels and licking your own ass. So... listen, if this whole thing doesn't work out, I give you permission to eat me. Ow! What the hell? What is that? It's a sign. It's a sign. We're near a road. We're near a road. Forward, Pretzel. Forward. Hello! Hello! Forward, Pretzel. Hello! What kind of psycho puts a sign in the middle of nowhere? Ugh. You know what, I have to pee. Stay. I have to pee. Oh, God. Oh, God. Pretzel. Pretzel. Pretzel, come. Oh, God. Pretzel. Pretzel. Pretzel, come. Oh, God. Come here. Come here, come here. Shh. Oh, God. Hang on. Okay, okay. Oh, God. Stay down. Stay down. Go. Go, go, go, go. Stay down. Go. Shh. Go. Forward. Forward. Shh. Stay down. Stay down. Go, Pretzel, go. Hurry. Hurry, Pretzel. Come on. Go. Go. Why are you stopping? Go, Pretzel, go. Okay, fine. Ow. Is this a trail? Oh. Oh. Forward, Pretzel. Go. Go forward. Forward, go. Wait, w-w-wait. Oh. We did it. We did it! Yes! We did it. Oh, God. We did it. Hey! Stop! Over here! Help! I hope you crash! Come here, please. Wait. Wait. Wait. Please stop! Please! Stop, stop, stop! Please. Oh, my God. Oh, thank God. Oh, thank you. ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ That Jesus Christ is born ♪ Do you like to sing? ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ Over the hills and everywhere ♪ ♪ Go tell it on the mountain ♪ ♪ That Jesus Christ is born. ♪ I guess I'm just not following, because, uh, I thought the whole point of a trust is that I get to do, uh, what I want with the money. Well, the trust your mother set up for you is revocable. That's subject to her oversight. Now, your purchase of this struggling guide dog facility, that raised a bit of a red flag for her. Okay. So, what, you just came here to tell me that? Well, no, I came here to shadow you, assess the business. Now, if I'm satisfied that this is a responsible investment, then I will report that to your mother. Okay. And, uh, if you're not satisfied, then what happens? Well, then all future funds will be frozen. I'm sorry. What? Like, what, she's gonna cut me off? Exactly. Okay. Good. Shadow me. I think you'll find that there are zero reasons any red flags should be raised, and you can report that back to my mother. I almost died! Jess! Uh... Is he okay? I don't know, Murphy. You heard gunshots, so... No, I mean... Pretzel. Is Pretzel okay? Oh. Um, his paw is lacerated. But he's gonna be okay. Just bandaging it right now. Okay, but about Max, um... do you have any idea where he could be? No. I have no idea. I don't even know if he's alive. You are so lucky that that bus stopped for you. Yeah. I may have to reevaluate my relationship with Jesus. Hey, can you guys just do me a solid and act like adults for one day? There is a guy here evaluating us, and I really need him to think I made the right choice - buying the company. Okay? - But you didn't. Just behave until my mom's spy leaves. If I get cut off, I'll lose Guiding Hope. Do you understand? I thought you said you don't take any money from your parents. Yeah, well, I lied, all right? Because I didn't want you to think I was a loser. You really dodged that bullet. Murphy, I'm serious. I've been keeping this company afloat with my own money. Oh, and you gotta tell your boyfriend not to call the work phone anymore. Max called? What did he say? He's alive and you shouldn't come looking for him, all of which should shock me. Did-did he say where-where he... where he is? No. I-I don't know. Anderson's out of the bathroom. I got to go. Ah, shoot. Looks like I forgot to stock the paper towels. Sorry about that. What are you doing? They finally came to a decision about my Darnell James arrest. And? I'm not fired, but they took me off the Parker case. And I'm under an official I.A. investigation. And desk duty. Yay. Sorry. It's all right. Got no one to blame but myself. I should never have intervened with Sarah's bust. How about a drink after work? Are you buying? You bet. Exactly how many people are on your payroll? The right amount. Excuse me. Yes. I'm Detective Barnes. Chicago PD. I need to speak with your employee. Murphy Mason. Yes. I'm looking for Max Parish. I don't know where Max is. He's the key witness in Nia Bailey's case. If he doesn't testify, she walks. That could be very dangerous for your boyfriend. He's not m-my boyfriend. Whatever he is, he's the only one that can keep Nia behind bars. I figured you would want that. For your friend Tyson. What exactly are you asking me to do here? If you know how to reach him, get him to come home. We can protect him here but not if he's on the run. Did you figure out which number Max called from? Client, client, breeder... Okay, uh, here's an unknown number. Area code 309. Where's that? Peoria. Wait, isn't that Max's hometown? How would I know that? Because you guys dated for months. I mean, don't you ever listen to anyone? Listening is literally all I do. Um, whose house is that? Jenny Dickens. Huh, it's his ex. Oh, that you know. I'm much more interested in who he's had sex with than where he went to elementary school. He's probably, uh, hiding out there. So, how far away is Peoria? Uh, about two hours. Okay. Come on. You're driving. What? No, I'm not. I haven't driven since the whole Wesley incident. I... My car's not even here. Jess, okay, at some point, you're gonna have to get back on the horse. All right? Okay. If someone gets murdered in your house... Give me this. You just leave your house? You just move out? Yes. That is exactly what you do. If we don't find Max, Nia walks free. I know that. Okay? And then he dies. Do you really want that on your conscience? Last time I got involved with this, Murphy... No. No. The last time, you were chasing after a murderer. We literally just have to find out if Max is crashing on his ex's couch. Okay? Please. Jess, I need you. Where are we gonna get a car? Easy. And over here, you'll see we have our state-of-the-art canine transportation... ♪ Johny says stay cool... ♪ Uh... uh, v-vehicle. Oh, God. Oh, God, there's Felix. Drive faster. I can't. Drive faster. Uh... Hey! One second. Excuse me! Hey! Sorry, dude. We'll be back. Sorry. Murphy, you cannot take that car! Hey! Stop! Isn't so bad over here. Closer to a coffee machine. Yeah, it's paradise. What's up? Grand jury chose to indict. DNA doesn't lie. They are prosecuting Darnell James for Tyson's murder. This is a good thing. Just come with me. I know Darnell didn't do it. How? Because he was with me that night. Darnell and I, we've known each other since we were 14. And we've been... more than friends for most of that. Jules... He's not a bad person. You arrested him to save him from the sting. He was looking at 30 years. I couldn't let him go out like that. I panicked. I, um... I won't blame you if you... decide to turn me in. I'm not gonna do that. Jules... I should come forward. Give-give Darnell his alibi. Let's-let's play this out. Even if you come forward, there is no way to prove that you guys were together. Jules, Jules, Jules, Jules... I don't know what to do. I don't know... It's gonna be okay. Look, you don't want to lose everything. If Darnell's being framed, then we will find some other way to prove it. How? I'm off the case. I'm not. Okay. Don't freak out, but I'm gonna hug you. Oh, God. Shut up. Want some? No. I'm working through a panic attack. It'll relax you. Like a food coma. Murphy. Murphy... Murphy, you just got mayonnaise all over my leg. Oh, my God. And only Felix is allowed to do that, right? I knew I never should have told you that. Can we just forget about that, please? Um, no. He's actually not as bad as you think. And we barely hang out anymore. I need someone to talk to. We hang out all the time. No, we don't. Not really. Just... Google addresses. Okay, then don't Google addresses if it's so hard for you. That's not what I'm saying. Just... I'm saying that, with Felix, we just hang out and we w-watch TV and we smoke weed and we talk about stupid stuff that isn't murder-related. Okay, Jess, what stupid stuff do you want to talk about? Never mind, Murphy. Okay. Normally, I would, uh, take the van to pick up dogs from the breeder, but... But it was stolen. No, no. Not stolen. Murphy just borrowed it. With my permission. She's with Jess, who-who is very responsible, so... Jess. That's the woman you exposed yourself to. What? Where'd you hear that? A number of people were discussing the incident at the office. "The incident"? No. Jess wanted it. That sounds wrong. Jess gave me permission, okay? But then, when she saw... it, she didn't want it. But not because of me. It was her problem. She's a lesbian. Which, you know, is obviously not a problem. I'm sorry, what-what was the question? Becker, I need you to grab these items from the evidence locker. You got it. Sweatshirt, dog hair, dental floss. Dental floss? Wexton. Barbara, this is Jules Becker. The, um, DNA found on Tyson Parker's steering wheel, that was pulled from dental floss fibers? Let me check. Yeah, it was. Thanks, Barbara. Oh, my God. Spectacular event of the year. Can I help you? Hi. I-I'm Murphy, and this is my friend... Oh, I already... I already gave to the Jimmy Fund. Okay? Thanks. Wow. I know. Rude. No, I was saying "wow" 'cause sh... She's hot. Okay? I get it. Yeah? Okay, no need to slam the door in anyone's face. What I was trying to say is, my name is Murphy... Jess. And I... I... I'm friends with Max. Uh-huh. Yeah, that tracks. Okay, yeah, come in. Step here. Thank you. Oh, wow. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Thanks so much. Here. Here. Mm. So, I'm Jenny. But you guys know that, since you stalked me. We didn't stalk you. Let me guess, you're dating Max, he got into trouble, and now... now you're cleaning up his mess. No. I was dating him. Oh. Excuse me. Yeah, excuse you. Okay, well, Max has a type. Huh? Oh. Yikes. Sorry. Well, he's not here. He called from this number. Are you serious? He's such an idiot. So he was here? Okay, yeah, he stayed here last night. But to be honest, I'm not sure if he's coming back. Can never tell with him. But you guys are free to wait it out if you want. But that's your one beer. Thank you. Yeah, real hospitable. Okay. Hey. Thanks. I just want to say I'm sorry. You were right... I should never have made that arrest. It was sloppy. As it stands, I think I was wrong. I thought they indicted him. They did. But I think someone's framing him. Framing him? Jules, come on. Darnell was Tyson's boss... He probably found out that he was selling to somebody else. We've seen this kind of thing happen a thousand times. Darnell's DNA was found on Tyson's steering wheel from dental floss. And I found footage of a guard taking the trash out of his holding cell the day the DNA showed up. Jules... Sarah, this whole Tyson case might be being orchestrated by someone. I mean, I'm starting to second-guess if the Wesley theory even holds water anymore. You compromised a case that I have been building for months for an arrest you're now telling me was wrong? I don't even know what to say to you at this point. Hi. You must be Felix? That's me. Hi. Felix Bell, CEO. Hi. Look at those little cuties. Yes, they're very excited to go get trained. Let me just say I hope this is the start of a real synergy between your beautiful puppies and my beautiful company. Same here. Oh. So, uh, this is for you, mademoiselle. Oh. Thank you. Yes. Where's your vehicle? Just there. Oh. The Chevy? It's a classic. And who's that man? No one. You don't have a... a van with crates? Oh, no. Yeah, of-of course we do. Just not... at this moment. But plenty of space here. Plenty of room inside, as you will see... Uh, uh... Is that garbage? Just-just a little bit. I take the trash to the dump myself to save money. But you know what? It's fine. I can get rid of it. You-you can't leave your trash here. Oh. Uh, no, no, no, no, no. I-I will come back to get it after I dump the puppies. Drop off the puppies. Drop off the puppies. Uh, I don't think, uh, uh, Guiding Hope is the right fit for us. What? Okay, well... Don't-don't-don't do that. Please. Uh, just give me the... just give me the puppies, huh? Wh-What if I... what if I come back tomorrow, okay? Then can I have the puppies? I'm-I'm... Don't. No, don't-don't... I-I just... I'm sorry. What do you think I'm gonna do, strangle them? I-I love puppies. Puppies love me. Everybody... um... knows that, so... Want to give me a hand? No. Yeah, don't forget to take that down in your little notes. It's been, like, an hour. You're not... you're not gonna offer us another beer? I bag groceries, so... can't just be giving out free beer. Yeah. If I give you this, can I have another beer? What? Nothing. Coming up. Bitch. - Murphy? - What? I do not think Max is coming back here, and I think we should go, because I'm very uncomfortable. You're always uncomfortable. Well... Why haven't you gotten used to it by now? Thank you so much. What did you mean when you said, "That tracks"? What's that? When I said I was a friend of Max's, you said, "That tracks." What does that mean? Well, you're hot, and, now I know, maybe an alcoholic. I'm not an alc... Um, what's the point? Well, it's kind of wounded girls. Wow. We should go. I'm not wounded, either. More specifically, addicts. It's 'cause of his mom, you know? Hmm. Right. I knew her before it happened. She was a drunk. Max was the only one who tried to stop it. Everyone else just kept drinking with her until she ended it. Yeah. It's, uh, it's an awful story. Hmm. Well, I think it always bothered Max that he couldn't fix her, you know, before it was too late. Okay, honestly, guys, I don't think he's coming back. He's probably crashing - with someone else tonight. - Well, is there a place we can get some food around here? The-the Rockpile. It's just down the road. If I see him again, I'll tell him you're there. Thank you so much. Murph, did you really know all that stuff about Max's mom already? No. That's what I thought. Now we know why he's such a disaster. Oh, yeah. Seriously. Look, I know I'm supposed to be all, like, "support all women" or whatever, but... Jenny's a bitch. Like... "Max dates addicts." Shut up. You don't even know me. Yeah. Like, just 'cause we dated the same guy doesn't mean you can psychoanalyze me. Go away. She sucks. I know. Incoming call from Dork. Why is Felix calling me? Bourbon. What? You stole my van and got me cut off! All my assets! I am toast. We all are. And guess what. Do you realize that you have now taken away the one thing, the one thing I have left? Well, Felix, I'm sorry we took the van. No, Murphy, you're not sorry, because you revel in my misfortune. My pain is like a candy bar to you. My hurt is like a warm bath that you bathe in.

Do you know how he got his gun? The one he used to shoot the flower shop guy? Look, I'm not even supposed to be on this case. I'm just trying to do right by Tyson. Wesley found the gun. Dude. She's cool, man. He found it? Where? Where'd you say he found it? Under the dumpster. Wait, you were here? Which means that Wesley couldn't have found the gun until after Tyson was already dead. So what? Wesley didn't shoot Tyson. I got to go. Nice laptop. Business must be good. You'd be surprised how many cops want to bypass that whole Fourth Amendment thing. So, why do you want to find this Mason girl so bad? I'm actually looking for her boyfriend. I'm pretty sure she'll lead us to him. Bingo. Her cell phone is about six miles from here. Vincent fired at me, but he missed. I fired back. I think I hit him, but I'm not sure. Beats wandering through the woods all day with, uh... one shoe and no eyes. God. I'm sorry I had to leave you. I didn't know what else to do. It's okay. Jenny, um, she t... she told me about your mom. I had no idea. Yeah, well, it's not my favorite topic of conversation. Did you come looking for me because... If you don't come back, Nia walks. And you and I both know that Nia's the one who ordered the hit on Tyson. Yeah. But if I do come back, she'll order a hit on me, too. They do the-the witness protection or whatever. Murphy. You're asking me to throw my entire life away. Max, you're already doing that by running away. Y-You're the only person who can keep Nia in prison. Murphy, I'm sorry. I need you to testify because her trial's coming up. Stop. Stop. No. No. At best, I get strapped with a new identity, and at worst, I get killed. Do you really want that? No, of course I don't want that. Stay where you are, and drop the keys out of the window. Murphy, did you do this? Did you set me up? No, I would never do that. Did you? Murphy Mason? Yeah? You're under arrest. For what? This vehicle was reported stolen. Oh, my God. Felix. Sir? You with her? - No. - No. No, I-I don't know him. I just... We just... we just met. Step out of the vehicle. Sir, you can go. Well...

I think Jenny was right about you. I think you are an addict. Oh, God, Jess. I like to drink, okay? That doesn't make me an alcoholic. I'm not talking about the drinking. Huh? Talking about Tyson. What? You're addicted to his case. And I know that sounds weird, but... you obsess over it, and you have absolutely no regard for the damage that it's causing. That's-that's really unfair, Jess. Murphy, the police closed the case. I still don't think Darnell killed him. No, of course not. Because that would mean it would be over. It is almost over. I just need to figure out who Nia ordered to do it. Oh, my God. Listen to yourself. Murphy, you are literally proving my point. Look at where we're at! Okay, I'm sorry you got arrested. Technically, it's your best friend Felix's fault. No. Stop making excuses. Okay. Murphy... I'm the one that's enabling you. I always have. And I can't do it anymore. I'm done. Jess, you can't stop helping me. Murphy, one... one of us is literally gonna get killed. Well... I'm not gonna stop looking for Tyson's killer. Well, then I need... I need to take a break. From... from everything. From everything? From you. Are you serious? If you insist on continuing with this, then I have to step away. You're seriously giving me an ultimatum right now? That's not how friendship works. You have no idea how friendship works. Thank you again for dropping the charges. Okay, stop thanking me. You know, after I lose Guiding Hope, you're pretty much the only thing I have left, so couldn't afford to lose you to the slammer. What am I gonna do if the company goes under? Maybe I can move in here. Pay rent. I mean, Murphy's never gonna speak to me again, so... I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. For what it's worth, I think you did the right thing. Wait. When you say that, do you... do you mean, "I think you did the right thing" or "I think you did the right thing"? Which one? Uh, the-the first one? Oh, my... Hey. You know what my therapist always tells me when I'm feeling overwhelmed? What? Everything is exactly how it's supposed to be. Do you believe that? No. Not even a little bit.
