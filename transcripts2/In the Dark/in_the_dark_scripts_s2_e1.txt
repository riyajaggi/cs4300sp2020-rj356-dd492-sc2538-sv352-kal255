 Last season on In the Dark... I'm Murphy. Tyson. Tyson, you here? Oh, my God. Help! Somebody help! I have to close Guiding Hope. I inherited so much debt, and I just couldn't crawl out of it. How much debt? Oh, $75,000. I think I know where we can get some money. Do you remember when Max took Murphy to that lake house? She told me that he hid $100,000 there.

 I'm not taking a drug dealer's money. JESS and FELIX: Whoa. I wish I didn't love you. But I do And I have since I was 14 I'm wondering if this dirty cop might be covering for himself. I'm gonna handle it. Yeah. You always do. It's my partner. She's got enough on you to put you away for a very long time MURPHY: I know what you did I know you killed Tyson.

 We were never supposed to cross paths. I knew he was one of Nia's guys And after that, he knew that I was one, too (whispers): Stop recording. By the way, your confession that I recorded-- saved it to the cloud, so... you're done. NIA: Look like your work friends stole my money. Oh, I don't want you to pay it back. You want us to launder money for you? NIA: You keep your company, I keep mine I'll see you soon, Murphy. What does this open? What does this do? Oh, my God. - I like your sweater. Oh, really? Thanks. It's, uh, it's old. It's Chico's. (chuckles) Well, it looks good on you. Oh, that's nice of you to say. Have a good night. You, too. JOY: Oh, boy. I think a woman just hit on me. What? Yeah, it happens a lot. I must have a look or something. Oh. How are we feeling? I'm... fine. Yeah? I'm good. Okay. Well, I got you lots of goodies. We've got lo mein at three o'clock. Okay. We've got mac and cheese at six o'clock, and fruit salad... Thanks, Mom. I think you should go, though, 'cause it's late, Mom, and I just kind of want to get some rest. I'm not going anywhere until you eat. Okay. Come on. I'll just eat something. Yep. That's really good. I'm fine, Mom. I'm good. I'm getting discharged in the morning, and Jess said she's gonna pick me up, so I'm all good. You sure? You know, I'm just gonna sleep right here. No. No-no. I think... You snore. Really loud. Thank you. I'm really-- I'm okay. I promise, I'm good. Okay. Mm-hmm. Please tell me you're done with all this crime stuff. No, I actually decided I'm gonna become a detective. I'm gonna put a little Sherlock Holmes hat on Pretzel and we're gonna solve murders. That's very funny. Yeah. All right. Okay. I love you with my whole heart. Thanks, Mom. All right. So you eat? I'm so hungry. Uh-huh. You call me, you need anything. Okay. Clean plate club. Clean plate club. - I can't believe I had sex with an actual murderer. Like, someone who killed another human being was all up in my stuff. I can't even imagine what you're going through. I mean, nobody can. I think Murphy can. Oh, yeah, no, I know. But I mean, I am just constantly in awe of the strength of women and what you're capable of overcoming. I just feel like I want to vomit, you know? Yes. Yes. Like, how bad is my taste? What is wrong with me? Hey. Don't victim blame. Okay? Hey, Chelsea? Can I get some wings? Um, they're in the back. I know. Okay. Ow! What? "I'm constantly in awe of the strength of women." Yeah. I am. That is a true statement, actually. Oh, my God. Jess? Please tell me you're in here. Murphy? What the hell? What-what are you doing out of the hospital? I left. You left? Wh-Why didn't you call me? I would have come and picked you up. Because I had to give my phone to the cops. It-it doesn't-- it doesn't even matter, I just need to talk to you. Okay, let me ditch Felix. Hey. No, I actually need to talk to him, too. (exhales) It's about your guys' little trip to the lake house. Whoa-whoa-whoa, wait, hold on. She wants us to launder money? You stole $100,000 from her. What did you think was gonna happen? Obviously not this. What were you guys thinking? It was Jess's idea. Wow, Felix. Wow. What? It was. Look me in the eye and tell me it wasn't your idea. It was your idea. Yeah, only because you were so depressed because Guiding Hope was closing. Oh, you were depressed, too. Don't try to act all cool in front of Murphy, like you don't care about Guiding Hope... Just stop. Stop! We just need to figure out a way to get out of this. Okay? Nia said unless we pay her back... So we're just gonna pay her back. Okay? And she also gave me this key, but I don't-- I don't even-- I don't know what it opens, so can someone please figure it out? Here, let me see it. Okay. Uh, well, it's a locker key. It says "C-G-S." C-G-S? FELIX: Capital Grove Station. I memorized the Chicago public transit system when I was seven and wanted to run away. MURPHY: Okay, cool. Let's just get the money, put it back-- no harm, no foul. Well, one tiny foul is it's in my safety deposit box right now. Then let's go get it. FELIX: 'Kay, banks are kind of closed at 1:00 in the morning. JESS: Yeah, we'll go first thing tomorrow. You know, guys, are we sure that this is the best idea? I don't know, Felix. Do you have a better one? Well... I mean, if we give the money back, then Guiding Hope closes. Who cares? I do! And Jess does, even though she doesn't want to admit it in front of you. Okay. You actually want to do this? I'm just saying I think we should at least consider it. I mean, this Nia person seems very invested in our company... JESS: What? No! Are you insane? We can't even talk about it? I'm just saying, let's weigh the pros and cons. Okay. Con: do you have any idea what happens to people who launder money? Uh, yeah, they end up like Max. No, way worse. You guys, I've seen Ozark It's, like, really bad. The show? No! What happens to people who launder money! You guys, I'm serious, we could die! Fair. Now let's weigh the pros. Pro: Guiding Hope stays open, proving it wasn't a totally idiotic investment, as I've been told repeatedly that it is... This is about your mother. You would rather launder money than admit to her that you failed. That is correct. Well, there's three of us, so why don't we just vote? Great. Great. Okay. All in favor of returning the money, raise your hand. Me. Oof. Tough break, Murphy, it looks like you're the only one with your hand up, so... Felix. I know that's a lie. You're an idiot. I'm going to bed. Stupid Felix is cheating. (sighs) This is unfair, guys. Ugh. This nicotine gum tastes like ass. (sniffs) You want to try some? (chuckling): I'm good. Ugh. (chuckles) Okay, there you go. Thanks. Of course. I, I don't know if I'm supposed to keep asking if you're okay. I'm fine. Yeah, I'm honestly fine. Dean is gonna rot in prison for the rest of his life for killing Tyson. So, I finally got justice. I feel like I can actually breathe for the first time in months. Yeah, wh-- Um... what about, what about Chloe? Does she know? I mean, I don't think he can talk to anyone until he's out of police custody, so... Right. Well, maybe you should go see her. No. (scoffs) Well... No, I'm the last person she should be around right now. I just want to move on. Yeah. It's been a lot. Hey. What is going on? You're-you're not asking me any questions, you haven't offered me a lawyer. I want my phone call. If-- if you have me in cuffs, you have to give me a phone call. I know my rights. Come on. I have a kid. She should at least know that I'm not coming home. Could I have a little privacy? Nia? It's me. I need your help. Oh, you want my help? That's cute. I don't understand. You killed Tyson, who was one of my own, and you lied to me about it. This relationship was based on trust. So we don't have a relationship anymore. Don't call me again. DEAN: Wait! Wait. I'm sorry. I panicked. You know that I am all that Chloe has. And the thought of her losing both of her parents? I did what any father would do. Mm-mm. Don't try me. I'm not the one. You good? Yeah. We lost our guy on the inside. How much does he know? Do I need to...? Nothing, it's just the drop point. It's not worth it. Besides, if something happens to him, they're gonna come sniffing around here and we got to be really careful right now. What? I don't think that dog place is a good front. Huh. You got another option? 'Cause it's not like I can just walk up on the street and ask somebody to clean my money. Besides, Josiah and his crew took everything south of 63rd while I was locked up, so we got to improvise a little. It's just... without a cop in our pocket, we got no way to know if these kids flip or not. I don't think they're that stupid. And if they are, you'll handle it. Hand me my lid. Phase one complete. Jessica, activate phase two. You mean pull up directions to the station on my phone? Yes. Phase two, please. JESS: What-what, wh-what are you doing? FELIX: What do you mean? I'm making a right. No, you weren't supposed to turn there. Then why did you say "turn"? I didn't. I said you were about to turn and then you just turned. Why wouldn't I turn when you say "turn"? Felix, I said about to turn. Nailing phase two, guys. Okay, well, you need to make a U-ey. A U-ey? Flip a U-ey? Yeah. It's a one-way street, Jess! Okay, well, then I don't know. Just give me the phone. I'll navigate and drive. I can do it. Okay? (tires screech) What was that? Oh, my God. Stay here. Well, I'm the doctor. He's not a Chihuahua. Just stay here, watch the bag. So sorry. Here's your bicycle. Are you okay? I am so sorry, man. No. I'm not okay. You hit me with your car. Yeah, I know. I'm-I'm sorry. W-What hurts exactly? Everything. I... It's all broken, all my bones. Your bones? Yeah. All your bones? Yeah. I don't... don't-don't think that's possible. Well, I'm bleeding, okay? All over. Okay. I see the knee. Yeah. My insides. Oh, my brain probably. You're wearing a helmet, so... It's not good, okay? It's really bad. You should figure this out. We can take care of this privately or... I'm happy to call the cops. So, uh... How is he? He's fine. Meryl Streep over there is faking it. He's threatening to call the cops unless we make a deal. That's extortion; we should be the ones calling the cops. I would love to call the cops, but I don't think we can call the cops because there's $100,000 of drug money in my backpack. So I think what we should do is just give him a couple grand, make this all go away. MURPHY: No, Felix, we have to give Nia back all of the money. So, no. We'll just-- we'll have the guy frickin' sue your car insurance or whatever. Yeah. I don't technically have car insurance right now. Oh, perfect. (sighs) Because Guiding Hope is bleeding money and I had to cut corners wherever I could. Oh, my God. And usually I'm a super safe driver, especially if given a competent navigator. Fine, fine, fine. Just give him $2,000. I will take it out of my savings account. Wait, you have a savings account? Yeah. Where do you even get that money? My paycheck. I put ten percent of it in my savings account every month. That's smart. Thank you. Okay. (faintly): $2,000 cash. Make this all go away. JESS: Oh, come on, Felix, hurry up. What is taking him so long? He's Felix. (phone chimes) It's Chloe. Why is she texting you? Um, she said she doesn't think you guys have reception 'cause she can't get ahold of you or her dad. And, um, she's asking me what time I think you're coming home from your trip. So she doesn't know yet. Definitely not. She just texted me again asking if I think you guys are having the best time ever. Uh, yeah. Tell her, uh, the highlight was when her dad kidnapped me and punched me in the face. Right, okay, well, I can't write that. Just don't respond. Murphy... I'm trying to forget about Dean and unfortunately that... that includes Chloe, too, so just don't respond, please. So... he drives a hard bargain. How hard? Ten grand. Uh-- Are you serious? MURPHY: Felix, are you, like, the worst negotiator ever? First of all, he wanted 12, so no. Second of all, I already agreed to it. Wh-- Uh-- You-you agreed to it? Felix, I don't have $10,000. Yes, you do, because you said you deposit ten percent of your paycheck and I know how much you make. And you've been working at Guiding Hope for three years, so that's 11 grand, right? Okay, fine. Cool it, Rain Man. So, how is your day going so far? Oh, fantastic. There you go. $10,000. Would you like your remaining balance? No, thank you. - All right. Give me the note. Is it done? Relax. I've had this backpack since middle school. Just do it. - Well, that's that. We'll have a staff meeting tomorrow where I'll break the news we're closing. Are you okay? I mean, no, but it's fine. I'm just... I'm really gonna miss this place. We know it's about your mom. Who am I kidding? Nothing I do will ever make her proud of me. I've been a failure in her eyes ever since I couldn't latch. I don't want to think about you breastfeeding. No, I said I couldn't breastfeed. What are we gonna do now? I'm gonna have to be a lawyer. (scoffs) Oh, poor baby. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a vet job? Good thing I have ten grand in the bank-- Oh, wait. At least you guys have prospects. Whatever. You can go on disability. It's free money-- you don't even have to do anything. Thank you, Felix. Did it ever occur to you that maybe I enjoy working? No. That has never occurred to me. This is to keep this place open. Nia isn't taking the money back. And toss that key. Don't go near that locker ever again. We can't trust that cop friend of yours anymore. Look, whoever you are, please tell Nia that we cannot launder... (gun cocks) Do you want to finish that sentence? Maybe this is a sign. No, this isn't a sign. Murphy had a gun to her head. So we should probably do what Nia says. No, we're not gonna do what she says. For the first time ever, I feel like my life is actually worth something. And I'm not gonna let Nia, or anyone, take that away from me. Okay, we tried to pay her back. If she doesn't want to accept the money, that's her problem. Okay. So what do you suggest we do? We're gonna turn her in to the police. 'Cause, you know what, she belongs in jail right next to Dean. Technically, there are separate prisons for males and females, but... Murphy, you're right. Thank you. Let's go to the cops. The cops? Seriously? That's how we're gonna get killed. No, she would never do that. If we tell the police what happened and we all show up dead, everything points back to her. She's not an idiot. I didn't want to bring up Dean, but given everything he did as a cop, why would we trust cops? Because they're not all like him. Let's go. Here's your coat. Oh, thank you. Okay, find outside. Felix? Seriously? This might be the last time I get to answer the phone of my own company. Let me have this. Guiding Hope, how can I help you? JOY: Felix, get Murphy on the phone. Oh, hey, Joy, uh... it's not really a good time... Just put her on. Okay, I will. Hold on. Murphy, it's your mom. She's pissed. Give me the phone. Hello. You left the hospital with an IV in your arm? Yeah, Mom. It-It's fine. It was a very small needle and Jess already cleaned it. That's not the point. I just got a call saying they can't bill insurance because you left in the middle of treatment! Is that a real thing? Apparently. I only left, like, 12 hours early. Yeah, well, that 12 hours is about to cost us $50,000 unless you get your butt to the hospital this instant. Can I go a little later? Oh, did I interrupt your busy day of doing nothing? The doctor leaves in half an hour. Get there right now! Okay, Mom. Bye. Fine. This is so stupid. Apparently, you can't just leave the hospital whenever you want. Yeah. We heard, she was screaming. Okay, well, now we have to stop by the hospital on the way to the station. (grunts) No, Murphy, you just go. Felix and I will take care of the cops. Mm. No, I'm gonna go with you guys. You had a gun to your head today because of us. I'm not gonna wait another hour. Felix? Yeah. Great. Thank you. Okay. Come on, Pretzel. I'm gonna call you an Uber and I will see you at home. Here. Hey. Come here. Make sure they protect you guys, okay? Okay. Be careful. I will. I love you. Hey, how's he doing? Alert. Good. I think a little freaked out. I haven't taken his statement yet. Thought you'd want to handle that yourself. But you did take the woman's, right? Yeah, she's says she's got a recording of him confessing to the murder of her friend, Tyson Parker. Here's her phone and her cloud login. Thanks. She gave consent to access it. I'll take it from here. You got it, Chief. Where is it? (muttering): Where is my phone? I need to talk to the police. PARAMEDIC: You're gonna be fine. (indistinct radio chatter) I need... I need to talk to the police. Who's smoking? Who's-who's smoking? Can I bum one? Sure. Can I get a light, too? (lighter clicks) Thank you. It's just one, Pretzel. Shut up. I just heard the recording. What were you thinking? Look, that-that was taken way out of context. You know me. You... You know I'm not capable of something like this. I've worked for the city for 20 years. I've put my life on the line. That's your job. Look, it was self-defense. I don't care what it was. Do you know the media circus that's gonna hit when this gets out? And I'm gonna be the one in front of those cameras. I'm sorry. This all happened on my watch, and there is no way that Simmons doesn't shank me to try to save face. Is the recording the only piece of evidence? Don't lie to me. That's it. There's nothing else. Great. This case won't even make it to trial, which, optically, is even worse. What do you mean? I'm guessing you didn't consent to being recorded? In Illinois, you have to consent for anything to be admissible. So the whole country is just gonna watch you get away with it. I'm finished. So the recording isn't admissible? Then what's the point of putting any of this out there? Riley, come on, you want me to bury this? You got to be kidding me. No, no. I... Look, I feel terrible. I want a chance to make this right. How can you possibly make this right? By stopping Nia Bailey. She's the real person responsible for the death of Tyson Parker. That kid didn't stand a chance. She had him dealing drugs for her when he was 15. We stop her, we stop thousands of kids who are gonna end up just like Tyson. That is what this department needs. We've arrested Nia before, the charges never stick. I am one of the few people that Nia trusted. I have information on her that no one else we work with would ever be able to get. And, Chief, she's gonna keep doing this. She will continue flipping good cops and-and outsmarting us at every turn. Meanwhile, she's got teenagers selling heroin to other teenagers. Nia Bailey needs to be stopped. And I promise you, if you let me come back to work, I will deliver her. Wipe the girl's phone. As far as I'm concerned, nothing was on there when I got here. Thank you. Just get me Nia Bailey. Hey, we need to drop the charges on Darnell James. He's got a solid alibi. Yeah, we messed up. I know. Sorry about this. Deep breath. Good. Again. Very good. Again. Good. Again. I think you got it. One more time, please. Very good. Okay, everything looks great. Now you can go. Check out out front. Thanks. This was all very necessary. Thanks. Do you know if Dean Riley is out of questioning yet? Sorry? Uh, he's a, he's a patient here and he was arrested, so they weren't gonna let anyone talk to him until he was out of questioning. I can check. Dean Riley? Yeah. Uh, you said he was arrested? Yeah. I don't see that here. He's being treated as a normal patient. What? Hey. Get out of my room or I'm calling security. Where did the cops go? You're supposed to be in custody. That was a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding? This is impossible. I need, I need to speak to someone. Maybe I should speak with someone. You assaulted me, and then you tried to kill me, and then you lied to the police about it. That's what you said? You said that I lied? You lied to me every single day since the day I met you, every single day, and you continue to lie. You tricked me into believing that you cared about me. And you killed my best friend. Get the hell out of my room. No. Why are you not in custody? Why are you not in custody? I don't need to explain myself to you. I've cleared it up with the chief already. (scoffs) You actually think you're gonna get away with this? Murphy, there's nothing to get away with. I didn't do anything. I have you on tape. It was in the cloud. I got it off my phone. Hm. Where's your phone now? I gave it to the cops. Right. Well, that would be me. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I... Find outside, Pretzel. Go. What is taking so long? Hmm, I don't know. Maybe they have actual emergencies. I said this was an emergency. I'm gonna go see what's going on. Hi. Um, I'm just checking in. Is there another route? No, ma'am. All right, can you, can you, uh, hurry? What do you want me to do? How far away are we? Three blocks. Okay, I'm just, I'm just gonna walk. That's too much. Yeah, well, keep it. Sorry, sir. Sorry. Hey, guys. I can take you back now. Great. Okay. Thank you. No problem. All right. Okay. What's so important? What's this? Okay, uh, so, the other day, we, um... MURPHY: Hi. Uh... Murphy... Sorry I'm late. ...what are you, Murphy, what are you doing here? I'm here for the big meeting. So what's been said? What did I miss? GENE: Nothing yet, just a mysterious bag sitting in front of me. Uh, is it-- Does anybody want to tell me what's-what's going on? I'm gonna-- I'm gonna tell you what's going on. Officer... I didn't catch your name. Gene. Uh, Clemens. It's Officer Clemens. Well, we recently caught someone... ...littering all over Chicago. It was very upsetting, it was very reckless. Bottles and cans, gum-- all over the city. So, you're all here because of litter? Yes. Yep. Because littering is the number one problem in our city. That's not true. Could be. Look, guys, I-I appreciate the honor and respect you have for Mother Earth, okay? But this isn't the type of thing that we-we focus on. Okay. Uh, we will just take our backpack of trash and put it in the trash where it belongs. There's garbage in that? Yes. Yep. It was evidence, but... I have a briefing I have to get to. I'm-I'm gonna walk you guys out. Okay. GENE: Okay. Nice meeting you. Pretzel. What just happened? We can't trust the cops. Wh-Why? Because they're protecting Dean. What? What do you mean? Dean's back on the force! I handed that cop my statement. I literally gave him a recording where Dean admits to murdering Tyson and they still protected him. So I don't know who we can trust in there. But you recorded him. I know. I don't even know how he did this, but he's literally getting away with everything. This is unbelievable. I'm sorry, Murphy. I... I don't know what to say. I think for now we just need to... we just have to do what Nia says because... we don't have a choice. GUARD: Darnell James. You're free to go. What? They dropped the charges. Your move. You're really okay? I'm fine. I'm strong like bull. When are you coming home? I can't take Grandma watching me. (chuckles softly) She boring you to tears? Oh, my God. All she does is talk about all the different ways she knows how to cook a potato. Well, don't worry, I will be out of here in a couple of days. Good. Where's Murphy? I don't know. I thought she'd be here. Yeah. Um... Sweetie, Murphy and I broke up. What? No... What happened? I don't know. She just... ended it out of nowhere. Uh... maybe the idea of me was better than the reality. Hey, it is what it is. I'll get over it. I told you, I am strong like bull. Come here. Jules? Baby, you home? Man, I texted you, no text back-- what's up with that? (whispers): No, no... (crying): No, baby. Baby, baby, wake up. Wake up, baby. No. Well? Wh-- The recording's not on here. Of course it's not. (sighs) He probably had his cop friends delete it. All I wanted was justice for Tyson. And I got it, I actually got it. And now it's just gone. It's like this never even happened. And Dean's just... just living his life like he-- like he always has. Yeah, Murphy, why don't you come and sit? I don't want to sit! I want to kill him! I was to destroy him! I want him to be in misery every moment of every day forever! He has to live with the fact that he killed a kid. He doesn't care. He only cares about himself and his own kid. That's what I'll do. Can you drive me to Dean's? Why? 'Cause I'm gonna tell Chloe that her dad's a murderer. Murphy... He can weasel his way out of prison, but he's gonna live the rest of his life with his daughter knowing what a monster he is, because that's worse than jail. Okay, hold on. Can you drive me? I can't. And I-I understand that you're angry, but this is not the solution. Stop, Jess! No, you... Drive me! Stop! I am not gonna help you ruin Chloe's life. I'm ruining Dean's. (scoffs) Whatever. I'll just get there myself. Come on, Pretzel! Come, now! Okay, hey, Mur-- (exhales) Murphy? Hi. Uh, can I help you? Is Chloe here? CHLOE: I know what this is about. I highly doubt that. (chuckles softly) My dad told me you guys broke up. Did he happen to mention why? Not really. He was pretty vague about the whole thing. Yeah, I bet. Look, Chloe... I get it. You don't have to explain what happened. My dad's a dork. I mean, I'm his best friend. Yeah, but he's not, like, your best friend, right? Um, yeah. I know that makes me sound like a loser, but... when I found out about the accident you guys got into, I thought it was going to be like my mom all over again. And I just... I'm just really happy he's okay. I don't know what I'd do without him. You're not happy I'm okay? Jerk. Shut up. Of course I am. (chuckles) We're still gonna be friends, right? Yeah. Always. Ugh. What kind of gum is that? Ugh. Why? Smells like ass. Ugh. (chuckles) Shut up! (laughs) Hey, uh, did you-- did you find anything? Suicide, no foul play. It wasn't a suicide. I'm telling you, there-there's got to be something here. I'm sorry. Take care, man. JESS: What are we gonna do? We have no idea how to launder money. We'll figure it out. It's not forever. I outsmarted a murderer, so I can outsmart Nia. Yeah, something tells me that Nia's a little smarter than Dean. Oh, because she's a woman, Jess? Yes. Look, I'm gonna get us out of this. I'm not gonna let anything happen to either of you. Either of us? Aw. MURPHY: Shut up. I'm serious. It's just temporary, but in the meantime, we do need to hire a new receptionist. Why? Because I'm not just gonna sit at my desk while you guys are forced to do all the illegal stuff. You just hate answering the phones. Is that what you really think? Yes. Fine, Murphy, I won't talk about Dean anymore. Come back to the bar. It's weird that you're sitting here. We-we just... Can you just hang on 'cause we need to figure out some work stuff. Work? Since when? FELIX: We're considering hiring a new receptionist. I actually own the company, so I get final say, as they know. We're discussing that, so... Okay, well, seriously, can you hire my brother? He just moved back here and he's looking for work. Send him in for an interview. Tell him the big boss is a big fan of his big sis. (Felix chuckles) Okay, well, hold on. Ben! Come over here. I want you to meet some friends of mine. Oh, my God. I can't believe you actually did that.
