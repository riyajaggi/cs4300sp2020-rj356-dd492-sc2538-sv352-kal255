 God, you are so hot. - Do you have any idea how hot you are? - No. That was legit incredible. Oh, my God. I didn't know your dog was in here. That dog is so weird. He follows me around everywhere. He's like a stalker. Mm. Mm, mm. Well, I had a great time. It was nice meeting you. That's it?

 Yeah. I'll text you. I'm gonna text you. But you don't have my number. Yeah, I don't... I don't understand why you don't get what's happening here. Okay, well, I'll-I'll just leave, then. - Bye. - Yep. Sorry. Sorry. Didn't see you. I'm blind. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. You can't pass the line again, Murphy. Did I? Oh, I'm sorry. Well, since I'm here, maybe you can ring me up.

 - Mm-hmm. Your usual? - Yep. You know, you really should buy condoms, girl. Bad for the environment. We all got to do our part, right? You're a gem, Maria. Yo, I made a new beat last night, dawg. Whoo, yeah, it was fire, man. - I'm taking over, yo. - Bro... Ty's homegirl's back. Okay, you know what? We'll see who calls me up for VIP when I'm at Coachella next year. Hey, miss that. Dude, Darnell ain't gonna like it if he comes by and you not here. Bro, just hold the fort down. A'ight? Hey, Tyson. Hey. I'm so glad you're here. I got you a stupid candy thing. Huh. Thanks. Can you, um... can you open this for me? I know. I didn't say nothing. I wish I didn't like sex so much, 'cause it's a very expensive habit. I think I know why you do. Oh, yeah? It's, like, the only time that you don't have to feel blind. You know, 'cause we all do it with our eyes closed anyways. Little insight for you. Oh. You're a smart kid. Too smart to be doing what you're doing. I could say the same about you. Would you like some pill with your water? Thank you. So, just out of sheer curiosity... Oh, no. You ever date a guy like me? A child? No. What you mean? I'm grown. You're like 17. - But, like, I'm adorable, too. - Yeah. Well... Like, if you see me. Well, I'd have to take your word for it. A'ight. Bet. What are you talking about? Feel my face, man. I just don't do that face-feeling stuff. That's weird. Feel my beauty. Bask in my curvaceous textures. All right. Give me your hand. Come on. Freezing out here. You say that like it's my fault. - It is your fault. - Wow. If you didn't hang out here, I wouldn't freeze my ass off every night. Then let us experience this horrific cold together. Good morning. Who's the best roommate ever? Get off me, dog. Ugh. I swear I'm developing an allergy to him. It's because he wants your love. And that's the only thing you're allergic to. Okay. Look who's bringing the jokes, crack of dawn. So, how was your night of... how do you say it? lovemaking? Ew. Don't be gross. I don't remember the majority of it. Do you want to know what he looked like? I could tell he was tall-ish. That's about it. Okay, well, this one had a real gummy smile. What? And he definitely had early onset alopecia. I could feel his hair, jerk. Dude, he was hot. You're missing out. You should've felt his face. I would never do that. Okay, please get up. Murphy, why do you never plug in your phone? Okay. - Come on. Hurry. - Ow. I can't be late for work again, and neither can you. Fine. - Did you get shorter? Where are you? - Shut up. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait - What? - Oh, God. You're so lucky you can't see what's happening right now. I am so impressed. I mean, acting is so competitive. What are you two dweebs talking about? I was just telling Kim I booked a beer commercial. - I'm moving to L.A. - Hey, good for you. What do you do in the commercial? Bottoms up. - Wow. - Wow. How could Jake leave us like this? Jake was great, but he was just a receptionist. - Maybe Murphy can do it. - No, Murphy... is not doing it. Sweetheart, our daughter is very smart. - She can handle this. - You know I wish this were true, but one of us needs to live in reality. Jake was the first person people saw when they walked through the door. He was basically the face of our company. Well, maybe Murphy can be the face of this company. Oh, that's a great idea. We both opened this place hoping it was gonna help her get her life back on track, but it has not worked, and I am not gonna keep trying to fix Murphy when she... - What, she's unable to be fixed? - Oh, you know that's not what I meant. You don't think she can answer the phone? - Can't we just not do this? - Hey, guys. - Hey. - Uh, I just wanted to let you know that the whole staff can hear you fighting. - Great. - Thank you, Felix. By the way, did you guys hear that Jake's gonna be in a beer commercial? Yeah, we did hear that. Thank you. Oh, can we eat in your room? We can watch some TV in bed. Yeah. Just give me one second. Hey, Murph? Uh, you should eat something. Mm-mm. Not right now. Uh, I'm gonna give you guys privacy so you can talk about your feelings and, like, touch each other's boobs or whatever you guys... Just ignore her, please. I'm gonna go hang with Tyson. I should take Pretzel out. No, let Murphy do it for once. It's her dog. Come on, let's eat. Okay. Hey, Murph? Hi. Do you mind taking him out? Come on, dingus. So, do you want to go touch each other's boobs now? - What? - Yeah? Yeah. Tyson, you here? Go. Go. Forward. Come on. What's wrong with you? Go. Tyson? Ty. Oh, my God. Oh, Tyson. Oh, Tyson. Help! Help! Help! You sure it was him? Yes, I felt his face. Did they identify him yet? Guys are looking into it now. Is it gonna take them an hour to get here, too? We had a busy night. What was Tyson's last name? Parker. Tyson Parker. You know how old he was? Where he lived? Fuller Park. You know him? Yeah. He grew up down the street from me. So what were you doing in that alley? Scoring drugs? - No. We were friends. - Friends? Yeah. They were really good friends. They would talk while she smoked. Anything else you can remember? He was in a sleeping bag. Or a blanket. I don't know. He... he didn't smell like himself. Right. 'Cause your other senses are heightened. That's not a thing. I'm not Daredevil. I just smelled him. Smelled like s... like smoke or something. What are they saying? I'll be right back. Yeah, my, uh... my daughter is blind. So... Car accident a couple years ago, so... She gets that "heightened senses" question all the time and random people telling her that she's their hero. I'm gonna puke. - Oh, d-do you need help? - No. - Hey, the... - Don't. She's... she's a really good person. This her guide dog? Yeah. That's Pretzel. Thinking about getting a guide dog for my daughter. Giving her a pal. Hey, your friend is gonna be okay. Yeah. Sorry. You just... you don't understand. Something happening to Tyson is probably the worst thing that could ever happen to her. They were really that close? Uh, a couple years ago, she got mugged. What kind of sociopath mugs a blind girl? Right? And, uh, he didn't just run up and grab her backpack. He beat her up really bad. She probably would have died if Tyson hadn't have seen it and stopped the guy. A 15-year-old kid saved her life. That's how they really met. - That's awful. - Uh... they didn't find a body. - Nothing? - No. They checked out the alleyway, all the surrounding streets. There was not even a drop of blood. I'm sure it was just a homeless guy taking a nap. Let's go. Wait, wait, I'm sorry. That's-that's it? There was nothing there. Your friend is wasted. Take care of your roommate, okay? Okay. Thank you. Hey. Did they identify him? Not yet. Are you okay? I ran a few of the numbers, and we can purchase three puppies if we cut back on office supplies. Is there anyplace else we could just pinch a few additional pennies? I mean, you pay Murphy to work here and... Guys, she doesn't do anything except eat candy bars and take naps. - No, no, no, out of the question. - Just saying. Are you sure it's set for today? I... Yeah. I just... I feel like there should be people. Yeah, there's no one here. There's nobody here. - Oh. Uh, hello. - Hi. Hi. Sorry to disturb you, but we couldn't find anyone inside the building. They're in the back, having a party for one of my coworkers. - So, you do work here? - Yeah. You'd think blacking out would be a little easier when you're blind. Sorry. I had a rough night. Well, I'm Gayle. Uh, this is Bradley, my husband. - I'm Murphy. - So... my mother got her guide dog at this facility, and we were just so grateful for the companionship that he offered her in her final years, and we wanted to make a contribution as a thank-you. Do you know where the owners are so I can give them this check? It's my parents. I'll-I'll give it to them. Oh. Don't worry. I'll give it to them. Okay. There you go. Sorry. - Okay, we should go. Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, all right. Um, I might just quickly run to the loo. Can you tell me where it is? Bathroom's over there. Well, if you had a rough night, hair of the dog always does the trick. It's a little early, even for me. Oh, when you get off work, and trust me on this, - there's a great bar in the... - Thanks. I only go to the Linsmore. That's in Wicker Park, right? It was nice meeting you. It was nice meeting you, too. Hey, Murphy. Hey. Hi, sweetie. The wine is already gone. Who is that? Sounds like a prepubescent girl. Actually, my voice is notably deep, and I used to sing baritone in jazz, so... So they just gave you a check for $10,000? Yeah. That's good work, honey. Way to go. "Way to go"? She managed to wake up from a nap. Oh, come on. Where's the snarky response? - Murphy? - Just not in the mood, Mom. Guess who. This game is only fun for sighted people. It's Bradley. We met earlier. Yup. Where's your wife? I just dropped her off at the airport. It's, um... it's crazy running into you here. Yeah, it's a real coinkydink. Sorry. I mean, I get it. Your wife is gone. You're bored. You're horny. And you get to thinking, "God, I've never boned a blind chick before." Porn has made all dudes a little kinkier. Hey. You all right? No. Is there anything I can do? Fine. Sweetheart. Oh, no. That's my wife. One sec! Hide. Hide. - Where? - Hide. Over there. Babe, is that you? Yeah. I'm here. Just... I'm just, uh... One sec, darling. I'll come to you, baby. Get cozy in bed. Yeah? - Hi. - Honey. - Hi. - Hey. What are you doing home? My flight got canceled, and I wanted to surprise you. Why are you out of breath? Are you okay? I was... I was just... I ran into the elevator. Wow, you've had a night, huh? No, I just... - ...had a couple drinks with Rick. - Uh-huh. You're acting really weird. Do you know that you're acting really weird? I'm not being weird. Darling, come on. It's nice to see you again, Murphy. - This is a glass table, isn't it? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, it is. What were you thinking?! I didn't lie to you! What?! I didn't lie to you. No, no, no, no. No, no, no. My cane. I'm sorry! I didn't lie to you! You stuffed her under a coffee table! - What were you thinking?! - I didn't stuff her anywhere! - I just... - Lied to my face! Call Jess. Call Jess. Oh, my God. Is-is my phone dead? Yeah. If I buy one of your hot dogs, can I... can I use your phone, please? Fine. Who do you want me to call? I don't have anyone's number memorized. - No one? - No, no one. Does it look like I have my life together, sir? So this is a first. A guy that I met online asking me for dinner. They normally ask you to lunch or...? No, 'cause usually there's never any food involved. Yeah, no, I know. It's bleak out there. I'm not much of a dater. - No? - No. Well, I'm happy you asked me out. I'm happy I asked you out, too. Excuse me. Uh, might be work. - Yeah, yeah, no. - Do you mind? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Yeah, sure. This is Felix. Why are you picking up the phone? Because I have the office calls forwarded to me after hours. How does that make me a loser? What do you want, Murphy? I need you to come pick me up. No, stop it. I mean, you're messing with me. You're not really blind, right? She-she is. Why don't you look blind? Same reason you probably don't look stupid. - She... - Whoa. - She doesn't look stupid, Murphy, okay? - I mean... She's actually very attractive, all right? Well, why would an attractive person be on a date with you? Well, actually, I go on dates with lots of attractive people, so... Oh, okay. I thought you didn't date much. What? No, I don't. I'm sorry. I just... - No? Yeah? - I was just trying to prove a point - that I have a lot to offer. Yeah. - Cool. Oh, speak of the devil. Hey, where were you? - Nowhere. - What are you looking for? I-I just need a pack of cigarettes. And I think my cane is in here... my old cane. What happened to the other one? - I lost it. - You lost it? Yeah, I lost it 'cause I'm a disaster. Can you help me find my old cane? - Yeah, I can help you. Okay. - I think I left it in here. Uh... it's right here. Here, here. Thank you. Yeah. I don't got all night. Where's she at? Man, she's right over there right now. Well... look what we have here. I don't believe we've met. Who are you? Darnell. You're Tyson's cousin. You're the drug guy. - Drug guy? No, no. - You're the one he always reports to. - His boss. - I don't know what you're talking about. I need to talk to you about Tyson. - What about him? - I think he's... he's... he's dead. I found his body here last night. Yeah, okay. No, I'm serious. I was here last night. Tyson texted me this morning. He met a girl and went to Madison for a couple days with her. No. Is that why the cops were sniffing around here last night? - Well, yeah, I called them. - You talk about my family to the cops again, we're gonna have a problem. You don't want that. Don't ever touch me again. Text Tyson. Begin new message. I've called you a thousand times. I'm really worried about you. Please call me. Send. Where are your parents? They're introducing the new puppies to the trainers. - Oh, my God. Seriously? - What? Tell me they didn't already buy the dogs. Yeah, they-they did this morning. Why? Because the donation check you got yesterday had a "stop payment" order on it. Trying to figure out what's going on. Okay, what if we explain the situation? Great idea. Sorry. A nice married couple donated $10,000 to us, but our daughter slept with the guy and the wife walked in. Joy, stop. We didn't have sex. How does it feel to not care about anyone but yourself? I don't care about myself. Like, at all. I think that's pretty obvious. I can't even be in the same room with her right now. One new text from Tyson. Hey, I can't talk right now. What's up? Hello? Is anybody there? Your boy isn't back yet. Where do I find Darnell? Okay, so, uh, Darnell is Tyson's cousin? Yeah. We're just gonna get food. - Can I at least just drive you, please? - That's so sweet, but he told me to come alone. Oh, well, that makes me feel a lot better. Relax. I'll be back in a couple hours. Great. Best day of your life. Let's go, dog. You like pancakes? Uh, sure. Hey, Marlene. Yeah, go ahead. Pancake breakfast and a coffee. Uh, can I just get a water? I don't drink coffee. And, actually, instead of the pancakes, can I have eggs over easy and a side of crispy bacon? Thank you. Sure thing. You said you wanted pancakes. You asked me if I liked pancakes. And I hate when dudes order for me. I think whoever started that trend should be punched in the nuts. So what do you want? Tyson texted me last night. He knows how much I hate texting. He would never not call me. I told you, he's with a girl. He doesn't want to talk to another girl. No, you don't understand. Something's wrong. I think somebody has his phone. Ty is fine. I'm telling you, he's not. I'm telling you he is. Here you go. I can't believe you don't even care about your cousin. 'Cause if you did, you wouldn't have let him sell drugs for you when he was only 15 years old. He was so much smarter than that and so much more capable. And you don't believe me. Because you're a drunk mess. My boys told me about you. Stumbling into the alley wasted every night. Why would I believe some sloppy, blind white girl? You're not even nice to your own dog. You don't know me. Yeah, you don't know you, either. Bye. - Same as her, please. - You got it. Hi, Murphy. Thought I might find you here. You probably think I'm pretty messed up, huh? I'm pretty messed up, too. She kicked me out. It hasn't even been two days, and I already miss her. Isn't that ridiculous? Not really. I miss talking to her. It's basic, really, but you know. Did you ever have someone who you really talked to? How much time do we have till Mom gets back? About an hour or so. I can't believe she still goes to her support group for parents with disabled kids. It's given her a lot of comfort over the years. I'm sorry. I know I wasn't what you guys wanted. Hey, you're exactly what we wanted. Oh, yeah. I was every adoptive parent's dream. That's why I sat in foster care for two years. You sat in foster care because you were waiting for us. I may not have been there when you were born, but you were always my daughter, Murphy. I love you, Dad. I don't say that very much, do I? Three times in 20 years is more than enough. I've had to pee for, like, two hours. What time is it? Late. 10:00. You can stay. I'll pull out the couch in the office. No, it's okay, I'm just gonna take an Uber. Uber. I didn't know you were Miss Moneybags. Mom... Why is your car always like a sauna? Can you turn the air on, please? The temperature is just fine. Ow! Are you serious? St-Stop. Murphy... - I'm sweating, Mom. Turn it down. - No, it's 72. Everyone is getting the flu. I am not gonna get a chill - because you're a little sweaty. - I'm too hot! - Shut up, Pretzel. - 72 degrees is fine, you know. Just settle down. Look, I am trying to drive you home. - I just wonder why. Why? - You're not... I don't need you. Why do I even try with you at all? You don't need to try! - I don't need you, Mom! - Pretzel! Pretzel! Pretzel, please. That's enough. - Shut up, Pretzel! - Oh, my God. Now the dog. Now the dog. Here we are. I forgot to give this to Dad. What is this? It's a check for $10,000 because I messed up. Am I supposed to go to the magic bank to cash this? I postdated it for 2020, so I'll be working for you and Dad until you can cash that check. Well, we need someone to fill Jake's position. We can't afford anyone else, so... Okay. Yeah, get some sleep. You look like hell. - Okay, thanks. - Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Come on, Pretzel. Hey, I got your stuff. Hey. You're awake. Yeah, I'll be ready for work in a second. I'm trying to figure out how to track a cell phone. Here are the results for how to sell a home. Okay, Murph, I-I... I told you, you should probably let the cops do this. Yeah, well, the cops are utterly useless. So you're next in line? This is ridiculous. Murphy, you can't solve the case. Why, Jess? 'Cause I'm blind? No, because you didn't go to school for it, Murphy, and you-you cannot even remember to plug in your cell phone. Ugh, this computer sucks. I'm gonna go use the one at work. Where are you? I'm right here. GPS call trackers can be used to track a location of the phone. You can also... - Murphy. - What? There's a cop here to see you, because of course there is. Really? And congratulations on the promotion, by the way. It's nice to see that there is zero nepotism - at this company. - Okay. Um, hey, uh, Murphy, it's me, Dean. We met the other day. Is this about Tyson? Oh, uh, no, sorry. Uh, I actually am here with my daughter, Chloe. Chloe, this is Murphy. Hi. Hi. Um, we were here to look into possibly getting a guide dog. Uh, that-that's my parents. Their office is... Yep. I can show you the way, actually. It's just right over here, yeah. Oh. - Sh-Should she come... - No, no, no. There's a chair right there. Come on, follow me. Here, right here. There you go. I will be right back. You guys can get to know each other. Maybe you have some things in common. What could we possibly have in common? My dad is such a dork sometimes. And that guy just said, "There's a chair right there," as if I have any idea where "right there" is. I know. That's Felix. He's such a loser. He always says stuff like that to me. So you're gonna get a guide dog? Yeah, I'm kind of a loner. My dad thinks I need a friend. I'm kind of a loner, too. Most cool people are. You think I'm cool? I know you are. Thanks for talking to her. She's a really sweet kid. Hey, um, I wanted to ask, if it's okay, just when your... how you lost your, uh... Virginity? Um, it was my 17th birthday. I had had a few too many wine coolers... Yeah, that was not what I was asking. Um, I have retinitis pigmentosa, so I lost my vision completely when I was 14. - Whoa. - Yeah. I'm so sorry. Tell me you don't do that to Chloe. - What? - The pitying thing. - I'm not pitying you. - No, your voice went down like three pitying octaves. "I'm so sorry." Okay. All right. Sorry. Look, treat her like any other kid. Get mad at her and force her to do chores, stuff like that. Yeah, that's all I would have wanted from my parents when I lost my sight. That's, um, maybe the best advice anyone's given me. So have you heard anything about my friend Tyson? Well... I'm sorry, there wasn't a body. Yeah, somebody obviously moved it. Can you track a phone? Murphy, I-I want to help you, but until there's some evidence that something happened to this kid, then there's nothing any of us can do. Yeah. Fine. Ugh, this is insane. Is there anyone working here? 3:00, guy, nerdy. Okay, watch me. I'm gonna wrap him around my finger, okay? Okay. - Hi. What can I do for you? - Uh... I-I lost my phone, and, uh... I can't find it because I'm... I'm actually blind. Uh, so I was wondering maybe you could track it and help me figure out where I lost it. Oh, I'm not supposed to do that. I'll let you buy me a drink. That's very nice of you, but I don't drink. I'm-I'm only 19 years old. Okay, I'll give you, like, 20 bucks. Okay, what's the number? Your name is Tyson Parker? Her dad loves Mike Tyson, but before all the assaults and ear-biting stuff. You guys know I could get fired for this, right? Yeah, but, do you, like, really care if you get fired from this job? I'm not gonna tell anyone. Okay. It's at 115th Street and King, but it's not on the main street. It's near the underpass. So it's-it's not in Madison? - No. - Uh, 115th and King? Got it. Thank you. Wait, where's my 20 bucks? This is how we die. This is how we die. Shut up, Jess. We're not gonna die. Just park, please. Come on. Come on. Okay, watch your step. Okay, are-are we gonna find, like, a dead body or something, Murphy? Because I'm not prepared for that. I know, technically, that I'm a doctor, but let's be honest, I'm a vet. Just stop talking. Okay, sorry. Call Tyson. Calling Tyson. Thanks for meeting me. Uh, you should know I've been a lot nicer to my dog. See? Is that why you called me here? Talk about your dog? So, someone was texting us from Tyson's phone. Okay, I'm out. Look. I found this last night. This phone was never in Madison. Wait, hold up. His phone was never in Madison? Someone killed your cousin, Darnell. And whoever it is, they are really trying to cover it up. We have to go to the police. Stay away from cops. Let me handle this, all right? All right? Okay. Where did you get this? I have my ways. So? I'll, um, give it to Forensics, see if we can get anything from the cloud. Thank you. Seriously, though, how-how'd you find it? Uh, by the way, took your advice. Gonna take Chloe to a Cubs game. I know she can't see it, but, uh, I used to take her all the time. I'm sure she's gonna love that. Listen, I know Tyson meant a lot to you. I'll keep an eye out and see if anything links back to him. If he really is dead... - He is. - ...or if he ran away, second I know anything, I'll make sure I'm on the case. I know you're just trying to be nice, but you're basically telling me you're gonna wait and see what happens. You want one? Hey. Jess? How'd you know where to find me? It's not that hard. You go to the same three places. It's true. Murph, I really think you should get some rest. I can't just sit around and do nothing. I have to find out what happened to him. I know. You're gonna figure it out. You are the most stubborn person I know, and in this case, that's a good thing. Come on, it's freezing. Let's get out of here.
