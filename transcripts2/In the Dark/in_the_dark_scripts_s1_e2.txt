 Previously onIn the Dark... Sorry, just didn't see you. I'm blind.We both thought opening this place was gonna help her get her life back on track, but it has not worked. Hey. Hey, Tyson. Feel the textures of my beauty. I just don't do that face-feeling stuff. Give me your hand. Oh, my God. Tyson? You sure it was him?Yes. I felt his face. Did they identify him yet?They didn't find a body. Until there's some evidence,

 there's nothing any of us can do. I really think someone killed your cousin. Ty is fine.You don't believe me. Because you're a drunk mess. Couple years ago, she got mugged. She probably would have died if Tyson hadn't have seen it and stopped the guy. I have to find out what happened to him. Tell me. What were you guys both doing? But was it, like, fine after, or was there, like, a second where you guys were both... like, did you both, you know, like, did you both hear that? It's okay.

 Somebody help! Help! Shut up. Help me! Okay, okay. 911. What's your emergency? This girl just got mugged. I need an ambulance. Is the victim conscious?Yeah, conscious, barely. Is the victim breathing?Yes, breathing. What's the victim's name? I don't know. I don't know her. Stay on the line. Paramedics have been dispatched. Stay with her. Okay, okay. All right, hey. Hey. Just try to stay awake. An ambulance is on its way. Just stay awake, all right? Just try and stay awake for me. Okay. You're gonna be okay, all right? You're gonna be okay. I feel like I'm failing him, Jess. Mm, Murph, it's only been a-a week. Yeah, and I've come up with nothing. Which makes sense, because I'm the only one looking. What about the cousin? Darnell?Yeah. He iced me out as soon as he heard I was talking to the cops. Which was pointless, because that detective dork hasn't even gotten back to me about Tyson's phone. Weren't you gonna file a missing persons report today? Turns out, if he's a minor and I'm not related, no can do. I need a photo and Social Security num... Oh, my God, are you texting? No. Wow. Wow! Pouring my heart out to you, and you're texting your chick. Okay, you know what? You-you don't know what I'm doing, because you're-you're blind. I know exactly what you're doing, 'cause I'm not a moron. Okay, fine. I sent Vanessa one emoji. Well, which emoji? Party horns. She's on her way over. She stays over every night. Murphy, come on, we've been here for hours. Walk back with me. I got to get out of my head. What's the dude sitch tonight? Uh, not great. Jess. Like cornbread and butter... Okay. There's a geek to your right. You would make his year. Chase my blues with the whiskey  And I chase my whiskey with the blues...  Should I get bangs? If you want to be happy for a day and miserable for three months, then yeah, go for it, babe. This happens so often that I'm starting to be able to tell how big they are. Do you ever miss it? What?You know, a penis. Oh. Uh... No, definitely not. I've only been with girls. Seriously? Wow, you're, like, a real lesbian. Yes. Oh! Oh! Oh, man! Fast as you can, fast you can  Fast as you can, run fast as you can...  Oh, Mommy! Oh... Oh, Mommy. Jess, you're officially fired from being my bar eyes. What happened?[scoffs] This dude called me Mommy. Ew. Ew. Guys are so weird. I remember this one guy who high-fived me when he climaxed. Don't try to bond with me. Oh, we got to go. We're gonna be late for spin. Spin? Since when do you spin? I spin. How am I gonna get to work? Your parents are picking you up. You got to be kidding me. Your mom is, like, next-level worried about you since this Tyson thing. You're not really gonna smoke in the house, are you? What am I, garbage? Please. You know, if you actually bothered to go on dates with these guys, you'd realize that they were creeps before you got to this point. That's great advice. Well, whatever. Have fun with these creeps who want to have sex with their moms. Let's go. Wait, that's it. Tyson's mom. What about Tyson's mom? She's the one who can file the missing persons report. How you arrived at that is seriously disturbing. Okay. I will see you at work, okay? And, uh, Murphy, please be downstairs at 10:00. Okay, let's go. Go.Let's go. Search the Internet for Mrs. Parker, Chicago, Illinois. Searching the Internet for "Mrs. Parker, Chicago, Illinois." Oh! Cancel. No, no, no, no. Call Dr. Lori Owens. Connecting you to Dr. Lori Owens. Oh, no. Hey, um, it's Murphy Mason here. Hi. Um, can you have Dr. Owens fill a prescription for a UTI, please? Uh, I'm sure. Yeah, I've had a million. Yeah, I can hold. Of course. Why didn't you remind me to pee after sex? Didn't they teach you anything at that dog-training school? Hi. Yeah, I'm here. Outstanding balance? Okay, great. Thank you for absolutely nothing. Oh! There are 3,600,000 results for "Mrs. Parker, Chicago, Illinois." Perfect. Yeah. Hey. Are-are you the kid? Yeah. That's... that's me. You're okay. Thanks to you. I'm Murphy. Tyson. Yeah. Oh, sorry. I was listening to music. On, like, the first iPod ever made or...? Okay. I'm gonna go get some cigarettes. Do you want anything? Yeah, I'll take a candy bar. Come on. It keeps me awake Wondering what to say... Oh, you know what? I don't need dumb antibiotics. Since the beginning of time, women have healed themselves. Mm... I know it's gotta be nothing but honesty  Like, only you can make me feel complete  Wait till you say... The cranberry juice is on the top right, Murphy. Well, you moved it. Hey, man, what's going on? Is everything okay? I forgot it was teacher in-service day. Chloe's just gonna hang with me until I'm off. Of course. This is the perfect place for a child. Thank you, for always making me feel so much better, Jules. Hmm. What? Nothing, sweetie. Is that that girl from the other night? Oh. Murphy.What's she doing here? She's probably checking up on that Tyson kid's phone. Murphy's here? Can I say hi? In a minute, honey. Just hang here. His phone?Yeah, she found it by an overpass. I told her I'd see if I can get anything off it. It's still in Forensics. Murphy? The, uh... the phone's not ready yet. Oh, I'm here for a different reason. I need Tyson's mom's address. I'm sure you have access to that.Uh, we do, but we also can't give out private information. When are you gonna get the results about the phone? Any day. We'll call you. Why is it taking forever? Because there's no body. It-it isn't a high priority. Then why isn't anyone around here looking for a body? Tyson still has all the criteria for a runaway. The best thing you can do right now: think good thoughts. With all due respect, my friend is dead. So all of my thoughts are pretty much bad right now. We don't know that. Whatever. Thanks. Hey, Murphy, uh, Chloe is here. She wants to say hi. Sure. One second. Oh, my God. Do you like hanging out here? No. But my dad thinks I can't handle being alone. Oh, my God. He needs to loosen up. Dude needs to get laid or something. What? Oh, um... It means dating. Like, your dad needs to go on a date. Oh, here she is, here she is.Oh. Murph? Thank God. Your dad right here. Hey, good morning.JOY: Good morning! Put your seat belt on. Mom, can you drive faster? I really have to pee, like, really bad. Your mom is driving the speed limit, sweetheart. Maybe stop drinking that juice if you have to urinate, honey. Exciting things happening around Guiding Hope tomorrow. We're having a "barkery." It's a bakery, but with dog trainers. Yeah, I got the pun.[chuckles] We just need you to show up and smile. Well, I can show up. Murphy, this is a big deal. Channel 37 is covering it. Oh, Channel 37. They're doing a whole piece on how we opened Guiding Hope for you. But you opened it up for you. No, sweetheart, we opened it up for you. Well, I'm not going on television. Oh, yes, you are. We're hoping that it would bring some donations. Which we desperately need. Look, we know you're still upset about Tyson, but I'm hopeful. I think he's gonna turn up. Oh, you have hope, Mom?I do. Having hope is ridiculous. The only thing that matters is actually doing something. But there's nothing you can do. That's not true. I'm gonna figure out who killed him. What?!Yeah, what? I'm gonna figure out who killed Tyson. Because I owe him that. Murphy, that's very noble, what you're doing, it is. Maybe you should just let the cops handle it. They're not doing anything.So? You have no idea what you're doing, and it is very dangerous. Look, just focus on the barkery. Jess? Hey. Ah, Jess!Yeah. Fix me. You're a doctor.I'm a veterinarian. Well, do something... please. UTI, the sinner's campfire. Could you live without the penis? Could you?How long are we talking? Long. Yeah, like, a really long time. Of course not. Why are you asking me stupid questions? Because Vanessa asked me if I miss the penis, and it sounds like she misses the penis. Well, stop calling it "the penis." Murphy, I'm freaking out. Wh-What if I'm just, like, a phase for her? You said she's really hot, so just have a bunch of sex with her and move on. Well, I can't do that, because... I think I'm in love with her. Well, I came by to discuss balloon duty for tomorrow's event, but obviously you guys are very busy. Uh, I'm so sorry, could you repeat yourself? I know what you're doing, Murphy. You're trying to figure out where I am by my voice so you can throw... You've never hit me once. Okay, so it looks like you're coming in at about a rottweiler and two Chihuahuas. You need one pill every 12 hours. I can mix it in your food. Can you drive me to a burger truck at lunch? Uh, no, I can't. I told your mom I'd help her make cookies for tomorrow. Why do you need to go to a food truck? Because I need to find Darnell to see if he'll give me Tyson's mom's address. Tyson said he used to go there, like, every day for lunch. Right, so, okay, if Darnell isn't even talking to you, what makes you think that he's gonna tell you where she lives? I know it's nuts, but it's my only option. Beggars can't be choosers. And there's a long history of blind beggars, so here we are. Hey. Hey. Can you not do that?I'm just trying to help. I don't need your help. Very funny, Murphy. Look, we need to talk about attire for tomorrow. What were you planning on wearing? The same thing I wear every day. I'd like you to wear a dress. I haven't seen your knees since you were ten. Would it kill you to look a little nice for once? I'm blind. I don't think anyone's gonna be judging my appearance... besides just you. And about this Tyson thing, I'm sorry he went missing. I wish he hadn't. Really? 'Cause you hated that I hung out with him. You hated it. So just admit it. I think this is a giant relief for you. That is unfair. Murphy, I worried about you down in that alley. Guess I wasn't the one you needed to worry about. I'm your mother. Sort of my job. Yeah, and you'd think, as my mother, that you'd care about the kid who saved my life. Give me your hand. What? What is this? A bird? Pterodactyl. How'd you do that? Well, it's actually pretty easy. I can show you. You must grasp the blank canvas. The first step, folding it in half. You can feel the corners line up? Yeah. Pinch right here.Mm-hmm. Okay.All right, now you take... We pull it as far as we can. Wings. Body. And then up here... Little body. Okay. ...is the last step. And now you're-you're done. Yeah.You did it. The student has become the master. Thank you. It's my pleasure. You should start a dating profile. I'm sorry? Apparently, everyone meets online now. It's how the world works. Oh. And it's not like you ever go anywhere. I go places. Like, I'm about to go to Dispatch and check a bunch of stuff out. Might even hit the water fountain on the way back. My life is crazy.Dad. You got a book? I'll be back in three chapters of Mockingjay,and then we can grab some food. Okay? Anywhere you want. Where you going, sweetie? I'm trying to find the bathroom. I'll show you the way. I know this place like the back of my hand. Thanks. Do you come here much? Yeah. A little too much. That's a Hinoki cutting board, man. Keep the dirty money off it. You got Eater's Choice Best Burgers because of dirty money, so settle. Wow, wow. Well, I like to pretend I bought this truck myself and don't have to integrate illegitimate funds to brine my own chuck roast. But it's nice of you to note my accomplishments. Man, you hipsters are exhausting. All old-timey. "Brine." Acting like you invented toast. The books are clean. I'll see you tomorrow. Seriously, come on. Let me make you a burger. It's savage. Savage? Don't. Come on. Fine. Okay, okay. What do you think? Okay. Yeah. Darnell? Oh, great. Yo, ignore that girl. I'd rather not. I'm not here, seriously. She's crazy annoying. Call Darnell. I hear your phone. Darnell, I know you're here. Reveal yourself! Seriously? Okay. Fine. Has anyone seen Darnell? Yeah, he-he sells all of the drugs. Oh, wow. Okay.Like, all the time. Yeah, he's a huge fan of recreational drug use. Yo, shut up. Didn't think you were here. What do you want? I need Tyson's mom's address.Why? Because I want her to file a missing persons report. What did I say to you, huh? No cops. Come on, dude, let me help. You have no idea how out of your zone you are. You want to help? Skip on out of here and leave me and my family alone. Is there a bathroom here?No. It's a food truck. Come on, how about... How about a burger? How about a-a milkshake? Apparently, I'm a rottweiler and two Chihuahuas, so I'm cutting back on carbs. You know, that was hilarious what you did to D. Dude's so serious all the time. You know Darnell?Yeah, he's my boy. So you know Tyson? His cousin? A little, yeah. I need to know where his mom lives. Why? I just do. Why didn't Darnell tell you? Because I didn't ask him.Hmm. I had come here... for drugs. I was picking up some drugs from him. What do you want?I don't know. What do I want? Depends. What's good this season?This is so sad. You're clearly lying straight to my face. To be fair, I can't see where your face is. Can you just tell me, please? All right, chill, chill.[sighs] If you go out with me. I don't go on dates. Give me an hour. Come on. Fine. One hour. But you should be really embarrassed. Embarrassed is not my thing. So, he's forcing you on a date with him in exchange for the address of your dead friend's mother? Yeah. He sounds great. There they are. I can't believe buying a plastic dong was your takeaway from our conversation. I know what I'm doing.Hmm, do you? No! That is why you're here. Look, as much as I love that you want me to pick out your penis, shouldn't Vanessa be doing it? It's a surprise. Oh, God.Murphy, please help me. Fine, fine. Is she more of a garden hose or soup can gal? I don't know; these questions were not a part of our courting process. Do you ladies need some help? Yes. On, like, every level, dude. Come on, come on.I-I'm going. Geez. Are you hungry?Come on. Okay, okay. What is the rush? How do you look?What? You're not wearing those pants that Mom hated, are you? Mom hated my pants? Just the khaki ones. Right. Oh, dear God. There you are. Hi. I almost gave up on you. Thought Daddy got cold feet. Yeah. Yeah, you came. Dad, this is my cool single friend, Jade. Here, come sit. Max? Right here. My roommate is taking pictures of your license plate in case you try to kill me or something. You look good. Just start the clock. All right. Right this way. It's gated. We've got to climb the fence. Of course it is. Wonderful. You're just going this slowly to eat time. Shut up. All right, just put your... put your leg over. Just... That's it. I got it, I got it. Hmm. Where'd you take me? Sunrise Beach. It's my, uh... my favorite view in all of Chicago. It's gorgeous. I'm blind, you idiot. Wow, I am an idiot. Yeah. Yeah. You like that. This surprise is taking a really long time, Jess. Yeah, one sec! Okay. Slip... Okay. What... What's going on?Um... Surprise. Okay, yeah. I'm-I'm surprised. But why are you wearing that? Oh, y-you know. Because I don't... I don't have one. And I-I... so I bought one. Murphy picked it out. And she said that this was, like, the right size and width. So what do you think? I look stupid. Are you saying you don't want a piece of this? I don't want a piece of that. You can't slap it. Oh, it wobbles. Why did you buy that thing? Well, I really like you. I really like you, too. Well, I-I... I like... I more than like you. Like... [breathes deeply] Like, a lot more, okay? Oh, my God. You love me. What? You love me. Vanessa, please don't make me say that while I'm wearing this. Now let's hear it. I love you. Isn't this something Happy? Isn't this something good I love you so much, Jess. Isn't this something Isn't this something good. It's relaxing out here, right? Can never really relax. What do you mean? Just being blind, it's exhausting. I spent three hours trying to find a cigarette I dropped the other day. It's just my life. Just exhausting. Why would you spend that long looking for a cigarette? Because they're expensive and I'm poor. Just, the point is, I'm at the mercy of the world. I-I... I hate it. Wow. "I'm at the mercy of the world. I hate it." Shut up. That's not how... That... Oh, it's not? I didn't sound like that. Are you sure about that? You know, you got that, um... got that tortured hot girl thing down, don't you? Yeah, you got that narcissistic douche thing down, don't you? Oh, for sure. I have a UTI, and I'm not gonna have sex with you, but thanks for the wine. And the sandwich. Why do you think I want to have sex with you? Come on. "Welcome to Sunrise Beach, the most beautiful view in all of Chicago." Okay, okay, first of all, I don't even want to have sex with you. Sure. I'm serious. All right, look. I'm a dick, okay? I sleep with everyone. But... I don't know. There's something about you... Something just different and special and you never felt like this before-- please. I sleep with everyone, too. That's never not worked. Yeah, it looks like you might be making love to yourself tonight. Thank God. Can I have your number? Yeah, I don't think so. Uh, do you have Tyson's mom's address? Oh. Oh, cool. I can totally see this. Why do you want it anyway? Because I need Tyson's mom to file a missing persons report. Tyson's missing? Didn't Darnell tell you?No. He's dead. Nah. I'm pretty sure Darnell would have mentioned that. Well, he is. I found him in the alley, and whoever killed him must have moved the body. So there's no body? Not yet. Well, in my world, you don't panic until a body turns up. Well, in my world, you panic when you feel your dead friend. And what does Tyson's mom think? I don't know. You're not really gonna go up to a mother and tell her you think her son is dead, are you? I have to. Murphy. Look, just... What? Make sure you're sure. I'm sure. Since when are you up at 7:00 in the morning? I'm going to Tyson's mom's before the barkery thing. Pretzel. Can I help you? You're Tyson's mom? Who are you? Murphy. I'm a... I'm a friend of his. You're the girl that was mugged? Yeah. He never told me you were blind. He always focuses on other things. Well, he's not home. Okay. That's what you're here for, right? Yeah. You haven't heard from him, have you? He usually checks in, and... starting to get a little worried. Are you okay? Yeah. Can I actually use your bathroom? S-Sure. Can I help you? Yeah. Thank you. Straight past Tyson's room at the end of the hall. Okay, thank you. I'll be in the kitchen. Okay. You little weirdo. 'Twas in another lifetime, one of toil and blood  When blackness was a virtue, the road was full of mud  I came in from the wilderness  A creature void of form "Come in," she said, "I'll give you  Shelter from the storm" He's not okay, is he? And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured  I'll always do my best for her  On that I give my word In a world of steel-eyed death  And men who are fighting to be warm  "Come in," she said, "I'll give you  Shelter from the storm" Not a word was spoke between us  There was little risk involved  Everything up to that point had been left unresolved  Try imagining a place... There's a chance what you felt wasn't Tyson. You're blind. You didn't actually see that it was him. That's true. Okay. So maybe it wasn't Tyson. And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn...  I worry about that kid all damn day. I bet your mom worries about you a lot, too, huh? Yeah. She's impossible. It's called being a mother. What was Ty listening to? "Come in," she said, "I'll give you  Shelter from the storm" In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes  I bargained for salvation and she gave me a lethal dose  I offered up my innocence, I got repaid with scorn  "Come in," she said, "I'll give you  Shelter from the storm" Well, I'm living in a foreign country  But I'm bound to cross the line  Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine  If I could only turn back the clock  To when God and her were born  "Come in," she said, "I'll give you  Shelter from the storm." You look like a lunatic. You wore a dress. Oh, is that what this is? Damn it. I asked for overalls. I'm sorry about today, Mom. Just help me clean up. Come on. Incoming call from that cop. Sorry. Hey, Dean, what's up? I got the report on the phone. Do you want to come in? Right now?That would be great. Like, I'm... Go, go. If it's about Tyson, just... go. So I got the forensics report back. Tyson's phone was wiped. Wiped?Completely. And the account was closed. We couldn't get anything off of it. I wish I had better news. Isn't that kind of suspicious that his phone was wiped? It's too early to tell, but now that a report has been filed, at least we can push forward. Yeah, that's good. And, uh, there is one more thing. I wanted to thank you for telling my daughter I need to get laid. Did I? Yes. You did. And so she set me up with a prostitute. She didn't know she was a prostitute, but still. Oh, my God. How was the sex? Uh, better when you pay for it? Be honest, be honest., I am... very glad that you're amused. Uh, in the future, could you please not give Chloe any advice about my love life, please? What love life? Good one, Murphy Mason. Hell of a dress, by the way. Thanks. Mm. Think I look like a prostitute? I mean, I'm asking you 'cause you're the expert. Okay, bye-bye. Bye. I can't find you in the dark So far away where you are But everything changes with time  When I run till I see the sun shine...  Hi. Yo. Oh, do you need a drink?Sure. Oh, no, I meant for the pills. Oh, I'm done. What? Dog antibiotics are finally kicking in. Okay, you know you have to finish the whole bottle, right? I feel like a million bucks. Where did you get that thing? So you told her you loved her while wearing a dong? It was oddly romantic. Gross. Romance isn't gross. What the hell was that? Trying to see you in the dark  Trying to see you in the dark  Trying to see you in the dark...  It's that food truck guy. Seriously? Yeah. Come here. What do you want? You wouldn't give me your number. Okay, so this is your move? Want to grab a drink? No. Tomorrow? No! Oh, come on! I know where you live.So? I'll just keep coming back. Fine. One drink. Whoo! Shut up. One drink tomorrow. Told you romance isn't gross. That isn't romance. It's borderline stalking. Oh, yeah, then what's that smile thingy on your face? I don't have anything on my face. Just that stupid smile.Shut up. Ugh. What does he look like? Blech. Horrible. He's basically disfigured. He's hot. Yeah. I can feel it. What's that? It's Tyson's. Ooh. He was into the Fairview Mustangs? What? It's a program for a dance recital at Fairview High School. He didn't go there. He drew a little heart next to "Keira Shields." He didn't tell me he had a girlfriend. I need to find Keira. Maybe she knows what happened to Tyson. Darnell, we in order? Yeah, just Tyson Parker-- he's still missing. You wiped the phone, though, right? We ain't got nothing to worry about. Yeah, but, Nia, there's this girl. Hangs out with him on the corner. I'll handle it.
