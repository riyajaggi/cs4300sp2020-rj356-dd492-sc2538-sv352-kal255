 Previously on In the Dark... Tyson. Help! I can't believe he's the one that did it. I know. Wesley deserves to rot in jail and think about what he did. I love you. I love you. I bought Guiding Hope. I have a girl in my bedroom who's not Vanessa. Oh, you're a cheater. And my boyfriend's sleeping in my room. What is happening?

 I wish I didn't love you. But I do. You killed Wesley? Technically, Wesley killed Wesley. This guy may have shot Tyson Parker, but... But someone else strangled him. Tyson's case isn't closed. Wesley didn't do it alone. Two people killed him. Jess told me that Wesley texted Tyson two days before the murder, telling him to meet him at Pearl Court. Been there once or twice; it's a Chinese restaurant. Murphy?

 Can she stay for movie night? Jaws. Jaws. Oh, God. Jaws. Jaws. I'm gonna flip a coin. Um... hey. I think we fell asleep. What time is it? Uh, it's early. It's, uh, 7:00-ish. I can, um... I'll drop you at hoe on the way to take Chloe to school. No, no. It's not a problem. I'm okay. No, it's fine. I'll just, uh... I'll probably, um... Request Uber. Your driver will arrive in 33 minutes. Uh... breakfast? So, um... what do you have going on today? Um, just work. Um... and then I'm gonna go to the place where Wesley met Tyson two days before he shot him. Wesley met Tyson two days be... How do you know that? Uh, I mean, doesn't really matter. Um... Hey, pumpkin. Hey. When did Murphy leave? I'm still here, kid. Oh. Oh! Nice. Stop. No, no. No. Here, sweetie. What's all this? Uh, just a little breakfast to help you study. Thanks. Uh-huh. Mmm. Hey, guess-guess what tomorrow is. Our seven-month anniversary. Don't make plans. That is not a thing. Well... But I love you for thinking it is. Oh, sorry. Let me guess. "Am I holding barbecue chips or sour cream and onion?" You know what? Whatever it is, Murphy can figure it out on her own. I have no idea who this person is in front of me, but I like it. Bitch. Text Jess. Texting Jess. Call me back. It's an emergency. I need to know whether or not I have the right deodorant. Send. Oh, my God. Forward, Pretzel. Since when do you ignore me? I'm trying to be a good girlfriend to Vanessa, which means I cannot be at your every beck and call. Okay, now your cheating is affecting my life. Okay, I had an emergency and you weren't there. It was not an emer... Okay. Jess, I... slept at Dean's last night. Wait, you-you had sex with Dean? No. Shh. I... no. I just fell asleep, like, on him. I feel really weird. Do you like him? No, of course not. He's a total dork, and I... I love Max. Well, I guess we are just two peas in a cheating pod. No, no, no. Hey, no. Don't try to pull me down with you. Okay, I just fell asleep. You made sweet, sweet love - to someone else... - Jess. Just curious, uh, what's the dress code for your seven-month anniversary soiree tomorrow evening? Seven-month anniversary? Oh, my God. Wouldn't it just be easier to... you know, "go downtown" or whatever? I did go downtown. Seven times in two days, and I still feel guilty. Okay, so, it's like a suit situation or...? Felix, it's at the Linsmore. Ah, copy that. So, is that like a suit situation? I need coffee. Slept, like, three hours last night. Think I got used to you sleeping next to me. Yeah. I know I didn't, like, sleep great, either. Well, should've came over. Gave you a key; you know you can use it. I should have. That was stupid. Table for two? Uh, actually, we, uh, we're gonna ask you... Is this still the right picture? Yeah. We're gonna ask you if you remember seeing this kid here. About s-six months ago or so? Uh, no. Table for two? He was with another guy. Maybe we can look at the security cam footage? I'm, like, definitely not allowed to do that. Come on, dude. Yeah, okay. Um... all right, look. I got... oh, like, an eighth and, uh... That's one, two, three... Five gummies. That's the day you're asking about. Okay, so I just use this to fast forward and rewind? Yep. Yeah? I'll be up front. Great. Okay, so, um, according to the text, Wesley said he would meet Tyson at 4:30. Okay, just hang on. 4:30. 4:31. 4:32. 4:30... there he is. You see Wesley? He just walked in. He's with someone. Wait. Oh, my God. What? It's Darnell. So can you go over it one more time? Darnell got up in Tyson's face. He yelled at him, then he left. Wesley kept at it for a while. It was brutal. So, was it Darnell? Could it have been Darnell? I don't, I don't know. Max. The guy is my friend. Okay? And he loved that kid. Well, maybe Darnell was in on it the whole time, and was just pretending to help me. No. If Darnell killed his own cousin, it would have to be over something much bigger than some low-level dealer in a pizza parlor. Okay? Like what? I don't know. Uh, I... I really don't know. I need to talk to one of his friends. Can't believe I'm talking to you guys about this. Well, Max works for Darnell, too. We're not gonna tell anyone. We won't. I swear. Come on. All right. It's just, Tyson was my boy. And if it really is Darnell, I don't want him getting away with it. It's not like I can do anything about it in my position. Well, could it have been Darnell? Okay, look, a few months ago, our boss, like, Darnell's boss, Nia, got arrested. D said somebody flipped. So he talked to all of us, but Ty was being cagey. Do you think Tyson flipped? I don't know. Wesley thought he did. Look, I got to go. We cool? Yeah. Yeah, thanks. All right. Okay, who the hell is Nia? Our boss. Uh, never met her. So maybe Tyson wasn't killed over the whole Wesley-Crawford mess, and Darnell just wanted us to think that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's possible. Okay, so is this all about Nia, then? I-I don't know. If I can figure out if Tyson flipped on her, then I'll know if Darnell had a reason to kill him. Sure, but I don't know how you're gonna figure that out. Cops really protect their informants. Oh, my God. I went to my sister's gender-revealing brunch today. Her what? It's like, uh, it's like this huge, stupid thing. Um, anyway, she cut the cake and saw blue, and literally started sobbing, and we were like, ugh. What? Because she's having a boy? Yeah. And then she tried to spin it and be like, "Well, I'm just worried because now's not the best time to be a dude." Ah. Sorry, I have to go. What? I thought that we were getting dinner when I got off. Murphy wants to talk. Dude. Come on. What? Are you being serious right now? You literally jump every time she calls or texts. I do not. Whatever. I mean, you... You obviously like her. You can tell me. We're adults. Look, I don't know what's going on, but I need to talk to Murphy. Wow. I'm sorry. You're an idiot. Like, a giant idiot. Can I get another one of these, please? Yeah. Hi. Hey. Um... I was really glad you texted. I've, uh, kind of been wanting to talk to you all day. Yeah? Yeah. Um... about last night, it was... nice. Right? And that is not why you are here. Uh, no, no. I am an idiot. Um, I mean, I'm with Max, and... We're-we're friends. You know? Yeah, yeah, can we just move past that, pretend that didn't happen? Y-Yeah, I-I would love that. Thank you. So, then, what did you want to talk about? Um, I wanted to ask if Tyson was an informant for you guys. I don't know. Who would know? Um, probably just Narcotics, or lawyers on the case. Why are you asking me this? If Tyson was an informant, then I think Darnell would've had a reason to kill him with Wesley. You actually drink that? Only in emergencies. Question. Have you guys ever humiliated yourself in such a deep way that it actually made you physically nauseated? No. I don't think. Great. Thank you for the support. Hey, by the way, any chance I could get the name of the informant that flipped on Nia Bailey? If I don't protect my informants, I won't have any left. Not helpful. Yeah. Why are you asking about Nia Bailey? 'Cause someone in her organization rolled. I mean, that's why she got arrested. Maybe it was Tyson. She's in jail. She couldn't have killed him. No, but she could've gotten a couple of her guys to do it. Wesley Moreno, Darnell James. Darnell's his cousin. Yeah, well, he threatened him. Darnell threatened Tyson? Two days before the murder. Got it on tape. Look. Got Wesley and Darnell confronting Tyson. Wow. Well, let's bring him in. I'm on it. Mr. James, thank you for coming in. Oh, for you two? Anything. Where were you the night of Tyson's murder? Seriously? Darnell, just give us your alibi, and we can clear this all up. I was watching the Bulls game with my boy Vincent. Yeah? Home or away game? Away. Who won? The Pistons. And I'm done talking without a lawyer. He's lying. You haven't said a word since you got here, so... What are we doing? There it is. What's the endgame here? I know you didn't kill him, but you know I can't do my job. I can't actually investigate you. This is ridiculous. They... We... have video of you threatening Tyson, and it's not a good look. Half this job is theatrics. I got to front a little, you know that. Well, I keep pretending like there's some happy ending here, and there's not. I can't do this anymore. No, no, come on, Jules. I love you. Yeah. But it's not enough. We've tried this "us." It doesn't work. I'm sorry. Yeah. What is that yummy smell? Oh, God, are you making something for Vanessa? I am making her seven cupcakes, one for each month. Okay, this is getting a little ridiculous. Dude! Now I have to frost another one. You know what, calm down. She doesn't even eat anything except blueberries. This is so good. Thanks. Okay, I'll be right back. Where you going? Um, remember that boss lady Nia I told you about? Yeah. I found out who her lawyer is, so I'm gonna go down to his office and get the witness list from her trial and see if I can figure out if Tyson was the informant. What? This is objectively stupid. Okay, so is making this big of a deal out of a seven-month anniversary, because you are a cheater. Shut up! Know what, you're mean. You won't help me. Do you really think Darnell could have killed Tyson? I'm starting to. Surprise visit. Can't be good. Nah, everything's fine. I just came to see about a little bit more responsibility. Where's this coming from? Let's just say I've given up a lot for this job, and if I'm gonna be in it, I need to be in it. No more middleman-ing. All right. Why so jumpy? I'm not. I need to make a withdrawal. Well, the bank is open. How much? Hundred stacks. Damn. That's a... What, are you skipping town or something? Nah. Come on, man, what... What's going on? Nia's having me handle a drop tonight. A big one. Ah. Got it, got it. Congrats, man. Congrats. Hey, man, you good? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Always. A'ight, then. Let's get it done. I can't mess this one up. Well, I don't keep that kind of cash on hand. But I'll get it, all right? A'ight, bet. They e-mailed it to me. Still objectively stupid? Murphy, shut up, okay? So you got the list, but, you know, they're not gonna have the C.I.'s name on there. I've never been here on the weekend. It's eerie. Well, you're the one that left our coputer charger here. I suggest we invest in another one. Hello. What are you doing here? You know what they say. If you don't bother coming to work on Saturdays, don't come on Sundays. What? What-what does that even mean? I have to mow the lawn. Cool. Okay. Uh... Do you see anything? Yeah, yeah, a witness list. Um... it says, "Undisclosed C.I." I told you, they don't just list names of criminal informants. And what are you guys doing? When have I ever told you what we're doing? Well, you have to tell me actually, because you're on company Wi-Fi and, oh, yeah, I'm the boss of the company. She's trying to figure out if Tyson was an informant for a big case. Ah. Well, does it say the informant was a minor? Because they have to disclose that. Is that true? How do you know that? I went to Harvard Law. Yeah, right. You knew this. Why is that funny? Wait. Wait, wait. You-you passed up being a lawyer to work here? Do you hate getting laid? My whole family went, so I went. But I prefer the nonprofit sphere. Now I'm gonna go mow the lawn. No, no, no, no, no. Come back. Wh-What were you saying? Oh, now you want to know? Yes. I was saying that the prosecution would have to disclose if the informant was a minor. So Tyson couldn't have been the informant. Well, if it wasn't Tyson, who the hell could it be? You want to tell me what Nia and Darnell met about yesterday? Did Darnell call you for cash? Yes. Okay? Oh, my God. The fact that I had to seek you out... You need to tell me when he's buying, Max. Okay. He's buying. When's the deal? Tonight. Tonight? Max, how are you not getting how this works? You've been stalling for months and now you're sitting on this? Oh, I'm sorry, maybe 'cause I'm rolling on literal murderers? You should've thought about that before you started cleaning money for them. How much is the deal? A hundred grand. That's the bust we need to convict Nia. One of her guys making a sale that big seals our case. Look, I don't care. What's gonna happen to Darnell? What the hell do you think is gonna happen to Darnell? He's buying $100,000 worth of heroin. Right. Yeah. Just tell me where the deal is, and we're good to go. I don't know. What? I don't know. Okay? Darnell doesn't tell me those things. I just bring him his money. Well, do not bring him his money until you know where the deal is. Or it's your ass. Where the hell is my money, man? I only have half the money right now. That's all I keep in any one bank. Well, you know I'm not going there to buy half their stash, right? Yeah, I know. I have more in a bank in Naperville. I'll go there. Naperville? How long is that gonna take? I don't know, uh, a couple hours, you know. I promised Nia this would go smooth. Dude, chill. I'll just meet you there. Okay? I got you. Hey. I'm good. All right. Uh, who's the man? Don't dance. Don't-don't do that. Mm-mm. I talked to Sarah. Turns out that she had a bead on that guy Vincent the night of Tyson's murder. Said he was out doing a deal all night. Vincent? Yeah, the guy that Darnell said he was watching the Bulls game with. So Darnell's alibi doesn't check out. Problem is... There's not enough to convict. So, you work for Nia. Mm-hmm. If it wasn't Tyson, who else would've ratted her out? Does it matter if it wasn't Tyson? Well, yes, because whoever it is is responsible for his death. No, I don't think that's true. It is true. Why are you being weird? I'm not. Yes, you are. You're, like, barely talking. Usually, you're like, "Murphy, tell me your feelings." "Murphy, let's talk about that." "Murphy, I wish you could see the stars." I'm just... just thinking. About what? About this whole Darnell thing. I'm just... Yeah, well... me, too. I'm just... I'm just gonna go talk to him. What? What, and you think he's just gonna tell you he did it? I'll know if he's lying. How? I just will. All right, Murphy. I got, like, five minutes. What's up? Darnell, I know you loved Tyson as much as I did. And if I was caught screaming at him two days before his murder, I'd want a chance to explain myself. What are you talking about? I know someone turned in your boss. Are you seriously asking me this right now? Just looking at the facts. There are two facts: Tyson wasn't a snitch, and I would never have hurt him. Ever. Even if he was. I did, baby... Cocktail delivery. Ah! Moscow mule for Vanessa, a very underwhelming Malbec for Jess, and a vodka tonic for my new friend Stacey. Well, good call inviting Felix. Thanks, guys. Cheers. Thanks, Felix. Come here, baby. Cheers. Chels? I'm not talking to you. What? Why? What is going on with you and Dean? Oh, God, Chelsea. We... we both fell asleep on the couch, and I just, I left first thing in the morning. You spent the night together? No. We just, uh, hung out. Okay, uh... I would like to make a toast... Come here, baby... to my... amazing girlfriend Vanessa. I love you so much, and I can't i-imagine the last seven months without you, so cheers. Wait. Let's Boomerang it. Okay. There it is. Wait, wait, wait. "Seven months with this one. "#Blessed. Hashtag..." Oh. One sec. Yes. "#LovelsLove, "#SevenMonths, "#Anniversary, #JessAndVanessa, "♪MyLove, ♪ MyHeart, ♪Together, #Goals." That one. I cheated on you. You what? You... I-I... I'm so sorry. - Jess? - I... Jess, you here? Yeah, just give me a sec. Oh. No. Uh, I-I actually have to go. I'm, like, dealing with this, like, whole situation, so... Yeah. Me, too, Murphy. Why don't you both go? Oh. Hey, Vanessa. Just go, and, um, take your slutty friend with you. What? I don't have a slutty friend. Was she talking to me? Some night, huh? Felix, why are you even here? You didn't get kicked out. I sort of hit on one of Vanessa's hot friends. Didn't go too well. Do you think Vanessa hates me? Where the hell is Max? Okay, cool. Sorry, he was just acting weird earlier, and he hasn't texted me back in hours. It's not like him. No, it's okay. Don't mind me. It's just my relationship just imploded. I'm actually worried, Jess. Okay? It's not like him. I think we should go check on him, please. Okay, fine. You want me to call an Uber? I could drive. You didn't drink? No. Felix, you bought, like, four rounds of drinks, and you didn't buy one for yourself? I'm a giver. Apparently that wasn't enough for Vanessa's friend. Where's your dumb car? To your right. Come on. Max and I have the exact same whiskey rocks. Oh, neat-o. Where is he? How the hell is he not at home? What was that? Uh, he just got a text. I guess they go through to his computer. Well, what does it say? Murphy, no. I do not feel comfortable... Felix, what does it say? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. A man's computer is a sacred place, believe me. Gross. Jess, please! Read it, please. It's from a number he doesn't have saved, and it's three question marks. Did he respond? Uh, yes. Just now. And? He says, "Lockhurst 342." It just went away. He must've deleted it. Oh, well, that's super shady. What-what the hell does Lockhurst mean? It's a hotel. I mean, not one I would ever stay at, but, you know, I drive past it on the way to work, and... So, 34... Uh... 342 is-is, um... Room number. Yeah. It's a tough break, Murph. Happens to the best of us, though. You know? Okay, Murphy, don't listen to him. There's no way Max is cheating on you. Yeah, maybe not. Okay? He's obsessed with you. Kind of like how you're obsessed with Vanessa? Oh, okay, you know... Felix, do you have your keys? Locked and loaded. Where's Darnell? He's getting here at 10:00. And when he gets here, we... I'll meet him in the lobby, and then we'll go to 342 and make the deal. Hmm. They have guns. They all have guns. That's great. Yes, Max, they're heroin dealers. And what if something goes wrong, hmm? Do you have guns? D-Do you guys have guns? Nothing is going to go wrong. I don't think I can do this. Okay, fine. Then we arrest you right now for money laundering. Hey, Murph, the elevator's right in front of us. Okay. I can take it from here. What? Hmm? No, I'm not gonna let you wander around this hotel by yourself. I'm fine. I have Pretzel. And I'm not gonna confront him with you and stupid Felix. Don't follow me. I'll text you when I'm done. Okay. Go, Pretzel. What are we supposed to do? What are you so giddy about? Narcotics is busting Darnell James tonight. They've tried it before. He's a sneaky one. Mm-mm. Solid this time. Sarah Barnes has him set up at the Lockhurst. Really? Huge shipment. Talking 25 to life. Plenty of time to build a solid case against him for Tyson's murder. That is good news. Mm-hmm. Now, about dinner, I will buy, but I will not do the Italian place again. You know what? Since Darnell's all wrapped up tonight, I'm gonna go home. Go have dinner with Chloe, or beg Chelsea to take you back. You think she would? Wh-Why did I cheat on Vanessa? Why did I do that? I... I don't want to be single. I'm not a good single person. Well, listen, it's not great over here, but... but at least we have each other. Can I say something? Do I have a choice? I think you tanked the relationship on purpose because you know she's not the one. Just... You... you go to too much therapy. Well, you're deflecting. Just drink your Mai Tai, girl. We're sitting by the pool. A Mai Tai is a completely appropriate choice of drink. It's an indoor pool. Well... In September. I like a sweet drink, okay? Three...

Okay, Murph... Let go of me. Don't touch me. What the hell... I'm an informant, Murphy. I assume you saw that text. It was from the Narcotics officer who arrested me. She told me I'd spend ten years in prison or work for her. Wait, it's you? It's been you the whole time... You... you put Nia away? Yes, but it's not really like that... You made me think it was Tyson. Look, it's more complicated than that. No, it's not. Wesley killed Tyson because he thought he was the informant. Yeah, but so did Darnell. And I'm about to send Darnell to prison for 30 years. Isn't that what you wanted? Huh? Tyson's killer in jail? I don't, I don't know that it's Darnell. I don't know that he did it. Max, you're... you're the reason Tyson is dead. No, listen... Just wait a second, okay, Murphy? No. Don't touch me. Please, just... Don't touch me. Okay. Okay. Find the elevator, Pretzel.
