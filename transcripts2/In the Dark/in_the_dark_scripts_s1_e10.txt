 - Previously on In the Dark... - Tyson... Help! I cheated on you. You what? I'm so sorry. Why are you asking about Nia Bailey? 'Cause someone in her organization rolled. She's in jail. She couldn't have killed him. No, but she could have gotten a couple of her guys to do it. Wesley Moreno, Darnell James. I can't do this anymore. No, no. Come on, Jules.

 I love you. But it's not enough. I just came to see about a little bit more responsibility. If I'm gonna be in it, I need to be in it. No more middle-manning. All right. I need to make a withdrawal. All right. Bank is open. How much? Hundred stacks. What's going on? Nia's having me handle a drop tonight. A big one. Where's Darnell?

 He's getting here at 10:00. And when he gets here... I'll meet him in the lobby, and then we'll go to 342 and make the deal. I'm an informant, Murphy. You put Nia away? Yes, but it's not really like that. You made me think it was Tyson. Look, it's more complicated than that. No, it's not. You're the reason Tyson is dead. Is there any way out of this? Darnell James, you're under arrest for the murder of Tyson Parker. What the hell was that? It was the only thing I could think of to get you out of there. I'm not going down for Ty's murder. You didn't do it. Which means they won't find anything to substantiate charges. You'll be out of there in two days. How'd your people find out about the deal? I have no idea. The only ones who knew about it were me and Nia. Oh, my God... and Max. That little bitch. Darnell? They arrested him. Yeah, but, you don't believe that he did it. I don't know. Just something feels off about it. Everything is off. How are you not over the Vanessa thing yet? Geez. I'm sorry. Because it's been a day. And I'm super depressed. What do you think she's feeling, do you think she's thinking? You just talked to her. You guys talk more now than you ever did when you were together. So unless something's changed in the last, I don't know, what, five minutes, I'm sure she's still shocked and, like, beyond sad. Call from Max. At least I'm dealing with my breakup. Okay. I have to go. I'm giving Vanessa back the rest of her stuff. Okay. Hang in there, all right? Stop. Thank you. Uh, before you go, though, um, dude sitch? Talk to Max. I'll see you at home. Look how cute this dog is. So cute. We need one. Aw. Uh, what's your dog's name? It's Pretzel. Oh, hi, bud. Could you actually, uh, tell me if there are any dudes here that aren't totally disgusting? Uh, what? Uh, I'm blind. I can't see, so I just don't really feel like dealing with a creep. Uh, could you tell me what I'm working with? Wait. I'm gonna love this game. Mm, that... that one is sort of cute. What, the-the one on the right? Mm-hmm. He looks like my Mormon cousin. No, he does not. You think everyone looks like someone in your family. You look me in the eye and tell me that your boss doesn't look exactly like my Aunt Nancy. Your Aunt Nancy is 20 years older than Julie. Sorry. So is the... is the Mormon-looking dude in the corner or...? Yes. If you can just... I'll just... figure it out... later. I'm just gonna miss us. We had fun together, didn't we? Yeah. Yeah, we did. But that's the thing. I... I need more than just... fun. I wish I could give that to you. You guys okay? Don't encourage them. Okay. Hey. Oh, go away. I only slept for, like, an hour. I know. I heard. I put all of Max's stuff in a bag for you. Cool. Burn it. Well, it's his phone charger and his credit card and his I.D. I think he might need that. So just be mature and give it to him. Max is the reason Tyson's dead. It's not like you and Vanessa. I know. It's a really weird, complicated situation, but that doesn't mean that you're not still heartbroken. And that's okay. I'm not. I'm really not. Do you want to know what I think you should do? I think you should give Max his stuff. 'Cause it's gonna make you feel a lot better. I promise. I'll cover for you at work. I hate you. Love you. What was she thinking? I have no idea. We have Darnell James dead to rights, maybe even in a position to flip Nia, and Jules goes rogue? Is this like her? Not at all. What happened? They're reviewing the case. My guess is suspension at the least. Why would you possibly think arresting Darnell James on your own on charges that were never going to hold was a good move? Look, I already explained everything to the captain. I got a tip that Darnell knew about the bust. If Darnell knew about the bust, why would he show up at the hotel? I don't know. To warn his guys? I was worried things could get ugly, so I intervened. Well, my informant's gone. My chances of flipping Darnell are gone. Okay, she gets it, Sarah. Well, it's on you guys now. Those murder charges better stick. And from now on, don't step on my cases. Okay. She's just pissed. She'll get over it. Hey, don't worry. We're gonna get Darnell. Hey, can you do me a favor? I just did. Just... get this to Nia Bailey. Division Four. Company time, Felix. Is this company work? Well, it's my company, Jess, so I can do whatever I want. Thank you very much. Okay, you're not that much of a loser. You can be a little more discerning. Well, I'm increasing the odds. Oh, this is my life now. Just back on dating apps, and girls swiping left or right on my Photoshopped face. Jess. Great. You're kind of ruining it. Sorry. Uh... Any chance you didn't see that? Wow. Wow. Okay. Cool. Oh, Jess. Food truck guy was the snitch? Mm-hmm. And the reason I'm sitting in here. And if he got the balls to testify against me at trial, I could stay sitting in here for a very long time. I see. Well, I'll pay him a visit. See what his plan is. Thank you. And I'm assuming... Send him my best. You violated the terms of your deal, Max. No, I didn't. You panicked and took off. I'm sorry, okay? I... I thought I heard something in the hall. You thought you heard... I-I don't even know what to say to that. I just need to make sure we're good. Good in what sense? Like, I fulfilled... tried to fulfill my end of the deal. You didn't. Well, I'm not doing this anymore. You don't have a choice. We can't protect you unless you hold up your end of the bargain. So just stay in town and act normal until Nia's trial. You're gonna be fine. Not if they find out it's me! I'm the only person who knows. Oh, my God. What? Nothing. I got to go. Hey. I've been calling you. Here's your stuff. Bye. Come on, Pretzel. Mur-Murphy, wait. Just... wait. Please? Talk to me? No. Come on, Pretzel. Why? I don't want to. Damn it. Get back in, get back in. What are you doing? I'm leaving. It's Nia's guy. We got to go. We got to go. Where are we going? You know you're kidnapping me? I'm not kidnapping you. Come on. I'm trying to keep you safe. I can totally tell. Hey, if he saw you get out of my truck right now, God knows what he would do to you. I should have never come here. I-I blame Jess for this. Wait, Jess knows you're here? Yes, she knows I'm here. She's the one who told me to come talk to you Okay. And give you your stupid stuff. Okay. Okay, I-I need you to text her right now and tell her you're fine. I'm not fine, Max. Look, she cannot come looking for you, Murphy. Tell me what's happening. What's happening? Look, Nia must have figured out I flipped on her, and I just saw her guy coming after me. Her-her guy... you know, her guy she uses to take care of things? What? He's gonna kill me, Murphy. Just text Jess. Please. God. Text Jess. Texting Jess. With Max. We're talking. Barf. Send. Thanks. Very believable. What are you doing with my phone? What'd you just do with my phone? Literally everyone tracks you on your phone. Did you just throw my phone out the window? Yep. I'm throwing mine out, too. Max, where are we going? I don't know. You okay? Wonderful. You know, if it makes you feel any better, her third photo is, like, super unflattering. No, it's not. I re-downloaded Tinder and stalked her profile. Jess, go home. No, Felix, I don't... I don't want to use a vacation day. Jess, I happen to know the boss, and let's just say he'll look the other way, okay? Are you sure? Jess, go. You're gonna start depressing the dogs. Thank you, Felix. And no more stalking Vanessa on social media, okay? Do you really think I have that kind of self-control? Well... no, but... Come on. Hurry. Let's go. There's no time. Well, now what are we doing? Ditching my truck. Let's go. Come on. Forward, Pretzel. Go. Why are you acting like I'm the one who killed Tyson? You basically did. That is not true. Yeah? Really? Tyson was killed because Nia thought he was a snitch, and who was the actual snitch? Oh. You. And you had, I don't know, maybe a billion opportunities to tell me? I should've told you. You're right. But that doesn't mean I killed Tyson. I don't want to talk about this anymore. Murphy. Just get away from me. Stop. Come on. Pretzel, this way. Do not talk to my dog. Come here, Pretzel. Shut up! Pretzel, come here. Don't. Stay, Pretzel. Why don't you get it? I cannot be around you. Well, you're gonna have to be. For how long? We just need to lay low for tonight until we lose him. Okay? And then... I'll send you home tomorrow, and we don't have to see each other ever again. Fine. Go, Pretzel. Forward. Good boy. Shut up. Forward. It's been, like, an hour. What's your plan here? Does it look like I have a plan? It's freezing. I don't... Yeah, I know it is. I don't know how much longer I can walk. I can't even feel my toes. Okay. Um... Okay, I... Wait, wait. Hang on, hang on. Here, come on, let's go. Where are we going? Just follow me. Come on. It's a boat. I'm not getting in a boat with you. Do you want to keep walking? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What happened? What? I just pulled my shoulder. I'll be fine. Okay, right in front of you... there's a seat, okay? I'm gonna need you to get up and sit on that, okay? This is so stupid. All right, all right. Okay, all right. I'm gonna need you to row. I don't know how to row! Just... It-it's easy. Okay? All right? Here. Take this. Take this oar. Feel that? Grab it. Okay? Grab it. Right there. Hold on to that one. I'm literally doing this to get away from you. Please, Murphy, just do this for me, okay? What do I do? Okay, you're gonna push down... and push back... put 'em in the water. Push back. There you go. Keep pushing. There you go. That's it. You g... you got it, Murphy. That's it. That's good. That's really good. Don't act like we're cool. Okay? Where am I taking us? Somewhere he can't follow. Good, babe. Don't. Sorry. Habit. All right. Slow down, slow down, slow down. Why are we stopping? Because the lake ended. Okay. Oh. All right. I'm just gonna get the bag there. Okay. This way. Pretzel, follow the horrible dude. Forward. So now we're just... walking on the other side of the lake. Great plan. Just... hang on. Pretzel, this way. Come on. Go. All right, wait right there. Hang on. What are you doing? Just... hang on. Okay? Max, what are you doing? All right, hold on. Okay? People are so stupid. Come on. Found a key. You're breaking in to someone's house or something? Who cares? You're so great. I miss you so much. Go inside where it's warm. I'll be right in. Where are you going? I have to stash this money somewhere. Just in case. In case what? Just go inside. Please? Go, find inside, Pretzel. We have Darnell James on tape threatening the victim. Lied about his alibi, and he worked with Wesley Moreno, whose gun was used in the murder. I'm sorry, that's not enough for me to press charges. Why did you arrest him? Was he about to run? It's complicated. Can you place him at the scene of the crime? Anything? No. His hand size matches the contusions on the victim's neck. Hand size? Really? Get me a fingerprint, a witness, something, or let him go. I'm gonna need you to help tie. No. Please. Fine. Whatever. Here, just take these two pieces in the back and tie it, okay? That's all you got to do. I just need to take the weight off of it. What can I do to fix this? I thought you had it all under control with the stupid sheet. There. You know I'm talking about us, right? What can I do to fix us? Hmm. Nothing. Murphy, come on. I'll do anything. Can go back in time and not be a giant liar. Murphy, this is... If I have to be here for 24 hours, I don't want to talk to you. Can you at least hear me out? There's nothing to hear out, Max. We're done. It's... There's nothing you can do or say to change that. I love you. Well... that sucks for you. Hey. Hey. Still nothing on Darnell? Not yet, but we may have caught a lucky break. You found Tyson's car. Mm-hmm. Here you go, Pretzel. Here you go. Good boy. It's a mac and cheese situation. Only thing I could find that wasn't expired. Fork's in the bowl. It's on your right. Eat. You must be starving. Mmm. Murphy, why do you never bring your keys? Hey! Felix? What are you doing here? Brought you food. I remember you said you liked that Indian place around the corner, and I noticed you didn't eat lunch, so... Damn it, Felix. Oh, God. Uh, wrong Indian place? No, it's the right one. That's just... that's just really, really sweet. You know me. Hey. Next time, tell me you're here. I did when I said "hey." Did I say you could sit? I don't remember asking. "I don't remember asking." Well... I really am sorry. What if we ran away together? It's pretty hard to run when you literally can't see where you're going. It's just one of the many disadvantages of being blind. I'm serious. I have a hundred grand. We could start a life. Start a life? With your stolen drug money? Cool. Sign me up. This is so unfair, Murph. I love how you're the victim here. Hey, you came to me. I came to you to-to give you your stuff back. Yet you're still here. Not my choice. We're in the middle of nowhere, just the two of us, and you still can't talk to me. Do you see how messed up that is? You want to talk to me about what's messed up? Murphy, you can't just end a relationship like this and pretend everything is okay. Life doesn't work that way. Yeah, you clearly got life all figured out. I have forgiven you for so much. You've slept with other dudes. One other dude. Broken up with me basically once a week. You nearly broke my nose. Oh, got me arrested. That was fun. At least I didn't lie to you every single day. It was that or go to jail. Or not forcing me to go out with you in the first place. What? So you're saying you wish you never met me? Exactly. You can't sit there and tell me you wish we never happened. I wish we never happened. Well... Then I guess there's nothing left to say. Finally. How long does it take to make a bed? I'm trying, okay? Try harder. I could do this faster. Then do it. Wait, what? Do it. Have fun. Well, hang on. Max. Hey. Dick.

Me when Murphy's not around. Let someone take care of you for once. Oh. No, Jess. You hadn't cried in, like, 20 minutes. I know. Well, that's your fault. Aw. I'm hungry. Yeah? Hmm. I can make you some cookies. No. I will make you some cookies. You stay right there and don't move, okay? And do nothing? I don't know how to do that. Okay, well, that's good, 'cause I actually have no idea how to make cookies. I can't believe we didn't know Tyson had a car. Well, the kid who sold it to him just changed the registration last week. And it shows up in our system today? That's weird. Yeah, well, get this. Tyson bought the car from him on March 4. The night he died. He was probably running away from someone. It seems like it, yeah. Anything? We found blood in the trunk. We'll test it, but my guess is... That it's Tyson's. So he was transferred in his own car after he was shot. Actually, spatter pattern indicates he was shot in the car. So the killer puts him in the car, shoots him, drives off, dumps the body. Be sure to check the steering wheel for prints. So... what does this mean? Nothing. That didn't feel like nothing. I was just masturbating with your body. That's it. Okay. What do we do? Okay, okay. Grab my hand, grab my hand. Where's Pretzel? Shh. Come on, Pretzel. Good boy. Good boy. Okay. Take my hand. We have to run. Max, I can't run. I mean, I literally can't. Okay. Uh, um, okay. Oh, my God. Come on. It's okay. We'll find somewhere to hide. Come on, Pretzel. Come on. Okay. Come on. Mmm. I'm so full. Mm-hmm. These are so good. So good, right? How do you do that? Magic. Yeah. Wait, look at me. Aw... What? You have, literally, cookie crumbs all over your hair. Oh, no. Oh, yeah. I'm so pathetic. You're not pathetic. Yes, I am. No. Yeah. Oh, shut up. Here, let me get 'em. Okay. Thanks. Wow.

Yeah. No, I... No, total... Like, I know. Yeah. I'm so... I'm sorry. Oh, God. So embarrassing. It makes... sense. I'm so sorry. Totally fine. I'm just gonna put my underwear on. Sure. Yeah. Okay.

Thanks. It's big. I know. Well, we got the test results back on Tyson's car. Good. And? Turns out the blood in the trunk was Tyson's. Yeah, we figured that. What about on the steering wheel? Any prints? No, no. There was some DNA. Did you run it? Oh, they ran it. Darnell James. Hmm. Okay. Okay, we can hide out in here. Come on. Where's here? Just an old boatshed. Come on. Inside. Come on. Let's go. All right. Just wait right there. All right. Now what? I don't know. Okay. I found a gun. Cool. I think it's loaded. Oh, my God. Hey. Hey. It's gonna be okay.

Come on. Come on. Let's go, let's go. Where-where are we going? You remember how to row? What? Do you remember how to row, Murphy? Come on. Yeah, but, I mean... What? Get in the boat. Okay. - Get in. Good boy, Pretzel. - Good boy. Okay, grab my hand. Come on. It's okay. Okay, s... Okay. You're okay, you're okay. Okay. Are-are you getting in? You getting in now? He's gonna find us. And this is my problem now, Murphy, not yours. No. - No. N-No, no, no, no. - Just go. I need you to row as far away as you can. Max, no. Row. Now. I don't want to be out here by myself. It's okay, it's okay. What are you doing? Just row. No. No. Just row. Now. Max. Max. Ma... Just row. Max? Max. Captioning sponsored by CBS
