 Previously on In the Dark... Okay, who the hell is Nia? Our boss. She's in jail. She couldn't have killed him. No, but she could have gotten a couple of her guys to do it. Wesley Moreno, Darnell James. Wesley had to have found the gun after Tyson was already dead. So what? Wesley didn't shoot Tyson. Is there any way out of this?

 Darnell James, you're under arrest for the murder of Tyson Parker. I still don't think Darnell killed him. They finally came to a decision about my Darnell James arrest. I'm not fired, but they took me off the Parker case. I know Darnell didn't do it. How? Because he was with me that night. Jess, you can't stop helping me. That's not how friendship works. You have no idea how friendship works. Maybe I could move in here. Pay rent. This whole Tyson case might be being orchestrated by someone.

Ugh, Dad, stop. Let your father take a picture. Why? I'm not gonna be able to see them soon. That's not funny. Why does she think everything's a joke? Okay. Just, come on. Just smile. I'm not taking a picture by myself; that's awkward. Jess. Come take a stupid picture with me. Oh, my God, I'm trying. Okay. All right, look this way and say "Happy birthday, Murphy." She's not here, buddy. I know. Oh. For you. Thank you. God, is this great. It's like living with... me. Cheers. Mm. Cheers. Hmm. Do you think Murphy's a mess without me? I think she's a mess with you. Yeah. Do you want to call her? No. No. It's fine. Yeah. Can I see your I.D.? Are you serious? Where's Maria? I buy alcohol here, like, every day. Look at the sign. Look at my Seeing Eye dog. Oh. Well, I still need to see I.D. It's one of those. Huh. Happy birthday. Thanks. I have a feeling it's gonna be my best one yet. It's Dean. Oh. One second. Whatever, just, uh, come in! It's open! Whoa. Uh... Pick this up? Are you here about Tyson? 'Cause I... I was researching some stuff about Nia, and I found out that she was actually originally arrested for racketeering. Wait, wait... whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. I don't really know. Slow down, slow down, slow down. All right... Are you okay? I mean, where is... everyone? Well, um... Max and I, you know, we... Well, he's gone. Um, and Jess moved out for a little while. Jess left? Yeah. I mean, it's temporary, I hope, but she gave me an ultimatum, and... Me, you know, I don't do ultimatums. Especially not about Tyson's murder. Especially if I'm this close. So it turned into this... Sorry, are you cleaning? I know you can't see it, but, Murphy, it's disgusting in here. So, did you just come here to insult the way I live, or... Sorry. No. I was driving to work, and I thought I would come by and give you a little birthday gift. How'd you know it was my birthday? When you got arrested, it was, uh, in your file. I just, well, remembered it. I have a good memory. Here. It's a tiny thing. There's no need to wrap a present for a blind person. Oh, come on, it's still fun to open the wrapping paper. Eh. Did you buy me a car? No, here, it's a... It's a color identifier. Here. Like this. Brown. Is that it? Very cool. Very, very cool. Sorry, it's lame. I... Chloe loves hers, and I just thought that... No. Very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you. I do. It's not you, I just... I kind of just want to forget it's my birthday. GROUP: ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Murphy ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ All right, sweetheart, blow out the candles. Yeah, I know how a birthday works, Dad. I know you're taking a picture. Please stop. Jess, get in there. Come on, come on, come on. Birthday pic. Are you ready? Go for it. Watch your hair, honey. Yay! Beautiful. Beautiful. All right, and back to work, everybody. We can eat at our desks. Chop, chop. Oh, my God. Here we go. Thanks for taking that dumb picture with me. Mm-hmm. My dad, you know, he-he just... he would have... He would have kept asking until I did it, I know. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, see you later. Uh, how are you? Are you good? Yeah. You don't want to kill yourself, living with Felix? Uh, it's actually not bad. Good. Um, would you want to cut out early? We could go get a drink at the Linsmore or something. No, I... Remember, I'm trying not to ditch work and do nothing with you? Okay. Fine. Happy birthday, though. Pretzel. This is a surprise. What's up? I was removed from your case. Is it safe for you to be here, then? Probably not. Darnell... Forensic tech says you wiped Tyson's phone. Standard operating procedure. Those phones have contacts, information... I get it. But if I knew anything about any of that, I would never have arrested you. Now, with this, plus the DNA in Tyson's car... The DNA was planted. You know that. Yeah, but the prosecutor doesn't. At this point, I don't know how I can get you out of here without... coming clean about us. Don't. We're not there yet. Yeah, but... I put you in here, thinking there was no evidence against you, and now there's just so much. It's bad, D. It's really bad. Maybe, uh... maybe you should talk to Murphy. Murphy Mason? I know it sounds crazy, but we're desperate. Maybe she's sitting on something that could help us. Murphy? It's-it's Jules. Your mom told me you just walked in here. Uh, you can come in. It's open. What are you doing here? I came to ask for your help. With the Tyson Parker case. Look, Murphy, I have to be honest. I'm not even supposed to be on this case anymore. There's just something about it that I... Look, I know Wesley didn't do it. What? He got that gun after Tyson was shot. Are you serious? That's literally everything we knew. I know. What about Darnell? There's evidence against him, but I really don't think he did it. Yeah, me neither. Murphy, I really need you to think. Is there anything I'm not thinking about? Any... any loose threads? I mean, there's the fact that I found him. Then I went to get help, and then, when the cops got there, he was gone. And then... I don't know, I mean, there's the-the texts. The ones you got from Tyson's phone? Yeah. A couple days after he died. Dean... I mean, Dean had said someone hacked into his phone, but they couldn't figure out who did it. You still have those texts, by any chance? Well, I mean, they weren't sent specifically to, like, this phone, but everything's on the cloud. I, uh, lose my phone a lot. Give me your phone. No, Dean already did that. He said they couldn't trace the IP. Chicago PD couldn't do it. We're going rogue now. ("Your Friend Kimmie" by Murder Shoes playing) Hey. Oh. Hi. Y-You don't usually work Wednesdays. Yeah, I picked up a shift. Oh. What are you drinking? Um, whiskey. And you can just fill the glass, like, all the way to the top. Where's Jess? Um, we're... we're just taking a little break right now. No. Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? No. Well, this one is on the house. As usual. But this time I'm actually offering it. You know, my last memory was of Jess. Your last memory? My last, uh, visual memory. When you go blind, um... you stop being able to, to see your memories in your head, because your brain, like, doesn't know how to make images anymore or whatever. For the longest time, even after I went blind, I could still see this image of Jess at my birthday party... like, hobbling over to me on roller skates. But then, um, one day, just a couple months ago... it was just gone. That's, like, the most depressing thing I've ever heard. Uh, well, yeah, it's also my birthday today. Oh, my God, Murphy. Yeah. I'm really sorry about the-the Dean thing. It-it wasn't... It really was nothing. Maybe to you. What? Come on. He's in love with you. He is not in love with me, Chelsea. Murphy, he is. Okay? It's fine. I mean, Dean and I were never, like, soul mates or anything. I just... It's bleak out there. And he's one of the good ones. Well, Chelsea, I think you are a very nice lady, and I think you're gonna find someone great. Oh... Stop it, stop it. I don't... Okay, don't be nice to me. It freaks me out. Hey, roomie. Hey. You okay? I feel bad leaving Murphy alone on her birthday. But it was the right thing to do. Right? Yes. Right. I think. What? Probably. Felix... What? I can't see the future. So helpful. Oh, my God. What? What happened? Nothing. Jess. Jess... What? Come on. I can help. Vanessa just called me. Oy-oy-oy. I know. And it rang, like, twice, and then she hung up. So it's probably just a butt dial, right? Okay, Felix, I need you to tell me that it means nothing, because I tend to overanalyze, and I need you to talk me off the ledge right now, because if I go... It's probably... probably nothing. Okay. Yeah. But... it could be something. What? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? It's probably nothing. Yeah, it's nothing. I'll see you later, okay? Felix! ♪ Listen when I say... ♪ Mind if I sit here? I don't care. That's a cute dog. Thanks. Can I get a pinot grigio? Mm, their pinot grigio makes you vom. It doesn't. Chels, it's, like, two dollars a bottle. It's poison. Vodka, Diet. Thanks for the tip. Guess when you come here as much as you do, you get to know the wine list by heart. I'm sorry, have we met? No... but I've been looking forward to meeting you. Well, you're gonna have to help me out. I'm sort of at a disadvantage here. Oh, come on, Murphy. You're smarter than that. Nia? There you go. What do you want from me? I just want to clear up a few things. Now that I'm a free woman. Okay. What? I would never send any of my people to jump some kid. Especially one of my own. Okay. Is that it? No. I came here because I'm a businesswoman, and for the past few months my business has been having some problems. Which you always seem to be at the center of. So from this moment on, I don't want to hear your name again. You understand? Do you understand? Yeah. Yes. Good. Don't go blabbing about this meeting to your cop friends. Oh. And, Murphy... Happy birthday. Murphy? You okay? Yeah, sorry, I just, uh... Sorry, um... Do you have my phone? Yes. Here you go. Thank you. We traced the IP address through a proxy in China, and the trail ended at the Birdcliff Coffee Bar in Evanston. Whoever hacked into Tyson's account was using their Wi-Fi. Okay, um... why couldn't you guys have done this months ago? Because China doesn't exactly cooperate with U.S. law enforcement. But my guy doesn't have the same... legal obligations. Your guy? You have a guy? I told you. I'm going off the books now, so... you're gonna have to trust me. It's gonna be two seconds, Felix. Okay. Then we can go. Whatever you say. Look, I ditched her on her birthday. I mean, the least I can do is go get one drink with her. You just want to ask her about the Vanessa call. That is not true. Oh, no. Oh, no. Go, go, go. What? What? What? Go. She's in there. Yeah, she's always in there. No, no. Vanessa. Oh. Will you just go look in there for me, please? What-what is she doing? Is she... looking around for me? I can't tell. She always looks a little lost, you know? What? She does. Just her face. What? Okay, so the-the day that she calls me out of the blue, she shows up at the Linsmore? Mmm. Huh. She's doing this on purpose. No, that's insane. You think... You think I'm crazy, right? I mean, this is kind of your bar. This is my bar. And she comes here with some hot girl... Whoa, whoa. She's hot? Oh, yeah. She is. Sowwy. God. All I'm saying is, it feels kind of, like, manipulated. Or something. Yeah. What do I do? I think you got to, like, go in there and tell her to stop playing games. Yes. I mean, if you want. It's totally up to you, I don't know. You're absolutely right. If I don't go in there and talk to her, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna keep going crazy. Yeah. Okay. There's too much at stake. She's a liability. Murphy Mason? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Arrange a meet with our guy tonight. I need to make sure she don't get in the way again. I'm on it. ♪ Do you care about the afterlife? ♪ ♪ Do you think of where you'll go? ♪ Hi. Jess, hi. Hey. Come here. Oh. Hey. Oh, uh, this is my friend Robin. Robin, this is my, uh... uh, this is Jess. Hey. Hi. Uh, can I talk to you for a second, right over there? Yeah. Okay. What's up? What's up? Yeah. You tell me, V. I have no idea what you're talking about. Oh, come on. You call me out of the blue and then you show up at my bar. Your bar... Vanessa, if you, if you wanted to talk to me or... or get back together with me, whatever, you could've... you could've just told me, it's okay. Jess... I called you because I was removing your number from my favorites, and I accidentally clicked it. Oh. Well, but you're here, so... Yeah, I left my credit card the night that you told me you cheated. So I came back to get it. I honestly figured you wouldn't be here. It's the middle of a workday, so... Oh. I'm-I'm sorry if you thought... No. Oh, God, I did not think anything of it. For real. It's... It was great seeing you. How'd it go? Ow! Thank you, Felix. What? What'd I do? Jess. What happened? You're an idiot. Me? What do we got? A café. Kinda cute. Bunch of douchebags on laptops? Pretty much. Great. Hey, what can I get you guys? I'm a detective with the Chicago PD, and we're trying to trace a laptop that used the Wi-Fi here. Do you keep a log of the IP addresses that use your Wi-Fi? Uh... no. Okay, um, can I speak with the manager? That's-that's me. Did anyone, uh... suspicious-looking or like, uh... you know, like "murdery," come in here on the... on March 6? Like, seven months ago? You're serious? Yeah. Is there anyone else we can talk to? Like a supervisor or a-a regular customer or something? Believe me, I am just as desperate to find answers as you are, but I just don't think there are any here. Now, you gonna tell me why you were so jumpy before? What? I'm... I wasn't jumpy. Come on, now, I'm a better detective than that. Murphy, you can trust me. I promise you. Okay, I... trust you. This cannot go beyond you. Okay. Nia came to see me earlier. What? What did she want? She just said that she didn't have anything to do with Tyson, and, and I-I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. I'll take you home. I can't just go home. I'm sorry, Murphy. Sometimes things are just dead ends. Come on, Pretzel. Do you have a light? No. But this place has matches. Here you go. Oh. Fancy. Forward, Pretzel. Thanks for calling me back, Rhonda. What's going on? Just... I can't move on until I know what happened. And I'm starting to feel like I might never know. Maybe you already do know what happened, and you just don't want to accept it. Yeah. Darnell? I didn't want to believe it either. But in a way, it's... it's not that hard. Well, you know, Detective Becker doesn't think that Darnell did it, either. She... she's been on the case for... Jules Becker? For months. Yeah. She's been covering for him since they were teenagers and he was slinging dime bags on the corner. What are you talking about? Jules and Darnell were real close back in the day. I don't know if they still speak, but she had a crush on that boy like I ain't never seen. Wait, they know each other? Yeah. You didn't know that? She's lying to me. Why would she lie to me? Why would she... Why would she lie to-to me? Everybody has their reasons. I shouldn't have, um... I shouldn't have bothered you. I'm sorry. Murphy, it's all right. I love that you loved my kid. But what you're doing isn't gonna bring him back. Do me a favor for Tyson. Quit smoking. It'll kill you. I will. Not today. Of course not. I will. Bye, Murph. Bye. All right, here. Coming in. I'm right here. Got it? It's not the worst. Yes. High compliment coming from you. So, um, how are things going on the Tyson front? You know what, I'm actually not here to talk about Tyson. Really? Really. Darnell did it, so... that's that. So it's really over. It's really over. Okay. Well... Murphy Mason, I have known many detectives in my life, and, um, none of them, not a single one, was as annoying as you. Annoyingly brilliant? Annoyingly good at the job? Yeah. Despite not being qualified or trained in any way? That's exactly what I meant. You got it. Thank you. So, then wh... why are you here? I don't know. Just couldn't go back to my empty, messy apartment. You and Jess... Same. I don't want to overstep, but, you know, you... you could call her. It's fine. Well, do you... want to stay for dinner? What? I do. I do. I just, um... I don't... I don't like whatever the hell you made. Ooh. Ouch. I'm sorry. What even is that? It's stew. Who eats stew? Like, are we in the cave times? What is that? All right, fine, shut up. Stew? Fine. Chloe hates it, too. Well, listen, it's still your birthday. We can go wherever you want. No, it's fine, I... I just want this day to be over. I hate my birthday. You can't hate your birthday. You've got to have one good birthday that you can remember. Not really. Not one? Fine. One. I can't believe you actually brought me here. I'm sorry, wasn't it you who told me I was supposed to treat Chloe exactly the same as before she went blind? Yeah. Touché. Now what? Uh, I am gonna go get us some skates. Stay right here. This is classic my dad. What do you mean? Just, what a dork. Yeah. Loser. All right. Looking good. Let's do it. Help me, please. I got you. Right here, right here. I feel like... I think we should just maybe go get some cigarettes and Slurpees instead. I feel like that'd be a really good time. No way. We're skating. I think someone else wants the first skate, though. I didn't take you to be such a forward guy. I'm not talking about me. Murphy? Wait. Oh! You okay? Yeah. Okay. Okay, hold on, sweetie. Are you okay? Oh, my ass. It's too bony. Shut up! Ah! Ah... Okay, okay. I love you. I love you, too. Hey, honey. Hey, just like old times, huh? Happy birthday, Murphy. My parents and frickin' Felix?! Well, I was with Felix when Dean called me, and Felix called your parents. Yes, he did. Now, come on up, honey. I'm right in front of you. Okay, you've got to stabilize your knees and use your core. Thank you. Up you go. Slow. Go slow. Okay, Mom. Stabilize your knees. She has to stabilize her knees. Shut up. Okay. Hold on. Go slow. I'm gonna get snacks. I'm getting birthday snacks. I'm coming with you. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Guess I'll tighten my laces. You-you, you want to do this? It's gonna be a disaster. Yeah, 100%. Where is it? Okay, we're right there. Yep, here we go. Oh... boy. ♪ Come on, Barbie, let's go party ♪ Okay. Whoa! Whoa! ♪ I'm a Barbie girl ♪ ♪ In a Barbie world ♪ ♪ Life in plastic, it's fantastic ♪ ♪ You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere ♪ ♪ Imagination ♪ Coming through! ♪ Life is your creation ♪ ♪ I'm a blonde bimbo girl in a fantasy world ♪ ♪ Dress me up, make it tight, I'm your dolly ♪ ♪ You can touch, you can play ♪ ♪ If you say, "I'm always yours." ♪ ♪ I'm a Barbie girl. ♪ You're gonna move back in, right?

I feel like you're so not supposed to do that. Move out of the way. Hey. Hey, hey. Whoa. Whoa! Wow. That was, uh... that was horrible. You are, uh, not a good skater. You know what? I think, considering the circumstances, I'm actually pretty good. You know what, you suck, too. No, actually, I'm-I'm amazing. Really? Uh, no. Knew it. Want to hear something stupid? Sure. Chelsea thinks you're into me, and that's why you guys broke up. Well, she's not, uh... She's not wrong. What? Murphy... I'm crazy about you. What are you doing? I'm trying to find your face. Oh. Here. ♪ When everything was quiet for a while... ♪ Okay. Maybe not the worst birthday, after all. Glad I could help turn it around. Timing is terrible. I-I have to run really quick for a work thing. I have to help Jules. Right now? I'll tell you what. I will... I will, um... I'll drop Chloe off, and then, um... maybe I'll pick you up later? No, just leave Chloe here. She's having fun. Jess can drive us home. All right. She's fine. Okay. See you later? Yep. You're playing with fire here, Jules. I got something. Something big. What's up? I saw someone meeting with Nia. And then I recognized their gun holster. We all have the same one. And then I started thinking, how was the person who did this to you able to tamper with evidence or bribe a guard to get their hands on your DNA? Seeing that gun holster, it all made sense. Darnell, I think the person who's framing you... is a cop. Right. Finally. Hey, Dad. I don't know who it is, but I swear to God, I'm gonna find that son of a bitch. Captioning sponsored by CBS.
