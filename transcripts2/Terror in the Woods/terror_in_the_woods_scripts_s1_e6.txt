 [ howling ] ♪♪ My name is michael feltner. My son, jordan, had "the bigfoot casebook." In the "casebook," it had reports from ohio, Kentucky, michigan, pennsylvania, And I was just like, "wow, that's cool." [ items rattling ] Hopefully tonight's the night. Tonight's the night. My name is mike miller. ♪♪ I've always been outdoors, Always enjoyed hiking and fishing. I developed an interest in bigfoot When I lived up north in dayton. On the local news, there was a report About a sighting in ohio, Which I laughed and thought, "you've got to be kidding me." Well, you know, you get curious. Well, I got online, and I stumbled into the bfro website And when I clicked on ohio, I expected to see one or two stories and that's it, And so many reports dropped down, I about fell out of the chair. Uncle mike! Hey, hey. How you doing? Good. Ready? I'm ready. Hey, mike. How you doing, buddy? [ laughing ] Miller: Oh, it's going to be a great night. ♪♪ Whoa. Insurance. Yeah, me too. [ laughs ] so where we going? Oh! Ah... I heard of six official sighting reports Of bigfoot-sasquatch type creatures in adams county, So we started doing our own investigations. Miller: Adams county is very remote. You can park on the road and get out a table and chairs And set it up and have a party in the road, And you wouldn't have to move for anybody. Yeah. Let's get going. Let's do it. ♪♪ ♪♪ Feltner: Adams county is a massive area. ♪♪ Real old farms, old barns, Real tall grass, and tons and tons forest. The road going in adams county is one way in, one way out. ♪♪ If you sprained an ankle, break a leg, You're not going to crawl your way out. If you do this out here, nobody is going to know it. ♪♪ Miller: First stop was, like, a little, small metal bridge. This looked very promising. We decided to stop at that spot on the bridge Because there was good echo. There was a little bit of a creek right there, And there was a nice ridgeline, And just very dark, spooky place even in the daytime. [ chuckles ] Teenagers. All right. Let's go. ♪♪ Whew. We brought lots of bug spray. Yeah. I had a flare gun. I had night vision, and I had a machete. Mike miller has his flashlights, and he has a handgun with him. Hopefully we won't need that tonight. I decided to bring a gun that night, And most night we go out is because you never know Who you're going to run into. There are other wild animals in the area. There's bears. There's mountain lions. Just to be safe. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ The kind of gear we packed up is portable voice recorders. ♪♪ We also have an amplified listening device To maybe hear if anything is moving around. Ready? ♪♪ [ howls ] ♪♪ I did a vocalization. I did a scream to see if anything would reply. ♪♪ Nothing. Nothing? Try again. [ howls ] Miller: We do howls because they howl, And we're mimicking what they do. It's almost like if you go into the woods into hunt a deer, And you're using a deer call, You're talking to the deer, bringing the deer in. Bigfoot probably doesn't care about that. We do the howl the creature supposedly does. A howl is kind of like a lure. We do howls to bring them in, bring them closer. ♪♪ [ howls ] Let's see if that livens things up. Let me listen. [ creature growls ] [ howls ] [ growling continues ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ howls ] It hears that, and it's territorial. It comes toward you to see what's going on. Who's in my yard? [ creature growls ] [ static playing ] [ howling ] It mimics him. It sounds just like him, just a hell of a lot bigger. [ howling ] The first sound we heard was "whoo," And it sort of tails off. [ howling ] We've heard owls. We've heard deer. We've heard about everything in the woods that makes a noise, And this is different. [ howling ] Do you think we just heard a real call? [ chuckles ] ♪♪ [ creature growls ] I was feeling, at that moment, excited. At the same time, a little nervous, Because, hey, we got company. I believe the creature that howled, It was sort of a warning out to other members of its kind that "hey, we got some visitors." We just waited to see if it would happen again. ♪♪ Seems like things are quieting down some. Let's go closer to where the call came from. Yeah. Sure. It's almost like going fishing. If they're not biting here, you're going to move down To another part of the lake and try your luck. Things died down, and we packed up and moved. [ laughing ] Feltner: [ laughing ] can you believe that? [ laughing ] no freaking way. I want to see more. I bet you this is going to be the night Where we actually see one for the first time. Feltner: We feel good. My son is sleeping, but me and mike feels real good. [ engine starts ] We get our gear going, and we wanted to try to, You know, let's see if we can stir some stuff up. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ growling ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ howling ] [ howling continues ] Miller: I believe the creature that howled, It was sort of a warning out that, "hey, we got some visitors." The drive from the bridge gets very rugged through the woods. As we made out way through the night and the darkness, The only thing you could really see Is what's illuminated in the headlights, And it's just trees and more trees And pine trees and foliage, And it's just dark. The lights don't pierce the canopy too well, So you're only seeing maybe a couple feet in. Beyond that, it's just pitch black. It puts you on edge. You're apprehensive. It's hard to tell which, you know, where you're at. ♪♪ ♪♪ Then you come out at a graveyard. I'm almost positive that I read this was one of the places That they saw an actual encounter. You want to set up here? Yeah, let's do it. ♪♪ You pull right up and, you know, you see the tombstones, And then there is one tree That's in the middle that's got a big cutout. It's very creepy, the creepiest tree I ever seen. Miller: It's sort of crazy. It's like a graveyard in the middle of nowhere. I'm going to put it on that tombstone right there. I don't want to go too far from jordan, So I'll set up here. You go down and do that. I didn't want to leave too far because my son was in there, And he gets kind of spooked kind of easy, But we're probably 5, 10 yards from the vehicle. ♪♪ Miller: The graveyard is 50 yards or less probably, And it feels somewhat uneasy, But at the same time it was reassuring Because it wasn't totally enclosed by woods. There was a little bit of an opening there, And it felt you could breathe. It felt like you weren't totally boxed in. [ creature growling ] ♪♪ ♪♪ Feltner: We get our digital recorders. We got them set. Miller: We place on the vehicle facing behind us, And the other recorder, we place it on top Of one of the tombstones. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ We decided to go at night because we believe These creatures are active and moving at night. ♪♪ Feltner: I have a wooden baseball bat I use Where you'll hit on a tree and see if they'll knock back. Primates do that, where they wood knock back at you. ♪♪ ♪♪ So we did that, see if anything replied. Nothing replied. Nothing. Try it again. [ knocking in distance ] ♪♪ We heard three knocks. It seemed like it was about 60, 70 yards, ♪♪ And then the sounds just stop. Miller: We've heard birds rustling. We've heard owls, crickets. It's a very odd feeling when all noises When you're hearing all this racket, And then everything just stops. It's stopping for a reason. What it means to me when the sounds of the forest Stop at night is that you've got company. Then nothing happens for about 25, 30 minutes. We're in a complete silence... ♪♪ ♪♪ ...Then there is a sound. [ shrieking ] [ shrieking, howling ] [ howling ] [ shrieking ] [ shrieking, howling ] [ shrieking, howling continues ] At this point things died down. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ banging in distance ] We heard something like somebody was walking in the woods. Whatever it is, it's getting closer. [ banging continues ] We freaked out. We definitely got company. [ banging getting closer ] Nobody knows where we're at. The only one that knows where we're at that night is my wife, And we hear this whistling. [ whistling in distance ] [ whispering ] what the hell was that? Miller: And that sound is like a whistling. At this point, mike and I just get really still, And we listen because we don't know what means for them. You know, is that a warning? Is that aggressive? Is it just, you know? But we're on, like, a high alert. We know they're coming closer. [ whistling, trees rustling ] There is definitely something here. ♪♪ After hearing the whistle, I felt nervous. We were being approached. [ night vision goggles hum ] The vocalization that we heard went off again. [ howling ] A very distinct, somewhat aggressive howl. [ howling ] Our adrenaline is off the roof. [ howling ] I do not believe it's the same creature. [ howling ] [ shrieking ] [ howling, shrieking ] ♪♪ Oh! Ah! What is it, dad? Feltner: My son, jordan, out like a light, Woke straight up. Woke up literally out of a dead sleep, And it scared us to death. What is it? What's going on? It's nothing. It's nothing. It's probably just animals or something. The howl to me was aggressive. If you step in someone's yard and the dog growls, That's what it sounded liked to me. You know, recorders can't do that justice. We heard that with our own ears. [ howling ] Here, here. Hold this. Hold this. [ night vision goggles hum ] ♪♪ [ howling, shrieking ] God, there's more than one. I feel very uneasy because at first it seems Like there's three of us, and there's one of them, And when the sounds are coming to you Form two different directions, That means that you're being surrounded And there is more than one. [ howling ] After the howl, the coyotes sort of joined in. [ coyotes howling ] [ creature howling ] This thing mimics the coyote. This thing literally starts going to, "wha, wha, wha." [ creature mimicking coyote ] Give me that. Give me that. [ howling continues ] ♪♪ You got to be a primate to sound out a vowel sound. That's what blew my freaking mind Because there is nothing else on this planet That can do that other than a human being or that. [ howling ] Is that thing going? Yeah. And then the coyote goes nuts. [ coyotes howling ] It sounds like a pack of coyotes, And then one actually sounds like It's being mangled or strangled or something. [ coyote yelping ] It's like something has it by the throat. [ yelping continues ] It almost sounds like it's pleading For it's life the way it's howling. [ coyote howling ] I want to go, dad. Dad, I want to go now. I want to go now. The adrenaline just runs right through you. [ howling ] Your heart is pounding. Your skin is crawling. [ coyote yelping ] You're almost in a trip-out mode, flipping out. You're like, you know, "this is happening. This is actually happening." Make it stop, dad. Make it stop. Make it stop. It's a show of force. [ howling ] They want us to leave. [ growls ] [ creature howling ] [ coyote howling, yelping ] Make it stop, dad. Make it stop. Make it stop. They want us to leave. [ growls ] Jordan! Go back to the car. Go back to the car. Go. Go. [ coyote howling ] ♪♪ I've never heard coyote do that before, And it was terrifying, absolutely terrifying. [ howling continues ] [ creature howling ] We're just sort of standing there in disbelief. Normally that much stuff doesn't happen. I mean, we're shocked. For some reason, these things have come in, Probably because because no one in that area Has ever done that to them. We've stirred them up. Jordan: Dad! Jordan, are you okay? Get out of here now! Let's go! Jordan is white as a ghost and is really shooken up, And he's ready to leave. He's had enough. Dad, come back! We was all just full of emotion. Come back now, please! [ howling stops ] ♪♪ Sounds like it's quietening down. Yeah. I can't hear anything. I'll have a look. [ night vision goggles hum ] ♪♪ See anything? No. Nothing. When I got back to mike and then everything seemed to calm down, We're like, "well, let's call it a night, you know. Hopefully we do have this recorded. Let's see if we can hear it and all that. Let's just roll out of there." We got what we need. Let's call it a night. Yeah. Let's get out of here. ♪♪ ♪♪ Dad, what's happening? Come on, dad. ♪♪ [ howling ] Hey. Did you hear that? ♪♪ At that point I'm getting alarmed Because they are moving towards us. [ howling ] Come on, now! We have to go! They're coming! Sounds like it's coming closer. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Move. Move. Move. [ howling continues ] ♪♪ [ howling ] [ engine revving ] [ howling continues ] And I'm driving as fast as I could, And then I put my foot off the gas, Try to slow us down because I'm like, "oh, god, I don't want kill us," you know? ♪♪ What was that, dad?

Where the heck did that deer go? ♪♪ What was unusual about this deer is it didn't look at us One time, even with the lights blasting on it and everything. It never looked at us. Instead, it's gaze was fixed. Stay here. ♪♪ It was looking straight into the woods Like it seen something or knew these creatures was in there. ♪♪ [ whistling in distance ] [ whistling in distance ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ whistling in distance ] [ howling ] ♪♪ The howls from the cemetery came from behind us, Probably half a mile back, And now where we're at now, the howls are in front of us.
