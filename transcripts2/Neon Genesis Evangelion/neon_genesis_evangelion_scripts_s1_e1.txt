 Like a cruel angel Become a legend, young boy When a blue wind Knocks on the door to your heart You just gaze back at me And smile oh so gently So eager for something You touch so softly Those innocent eyes Know nothing of the fate that awaits But one day, you will realize That upon your back You have wings You can fly to the faraway future The cruel angel's thesis One day, you'll take off through a window If your overflowing pathos

At 12:30 p.m. today, a special state of emergency has been declared for the Toukai region and the surrounding mid-Kanto area. All residents, proceed to your designated evacuation shelter immediately.

 are currently disabled due to the special state of emergency. I can't reach her? I shouldn't have come. I'll never make it. That's that, then. Might as well head to a shelter. Unidentified object is continuing its approach to this facility. We have visual on target. Sending to main screen. It's been 15 years. Yes, there's no doubt about it. It's an Angel. All missiles, direct hit! Sorry! Been waiting long? Target unfazed. It is continuing to advance towards Tokyo-3. Local air units are unable to slow its advance! This is total war. Launch all units from Atsugi and Iruma as well. Commit everything we have! Crush the target at all costs! This makes no sense! Those were direct hits! Our armored battalion has been wiped out. Guided munitions, bombs, and artillery are having no effect. D*** it! This kind of firepower isn't getting us anywhere! An A.T. Field? Yes. Standard weapons will be useless against the Angels. Yes, sir. We'll deploy it according to plan. They wouldn't... They're gonna use an N2 land mine?! Get down! We did it! Sorry, but your services weren't required this time. Shock wave incoming. Are you okay? Yes, but I got some sand in my mouth. Glad to hear it. Okay... Here we go! One, two! Thank you. I couldn't have done it without you. No, I should be thanking you, Ms. Katsuragi. Call me Misato, okay? It's nice to meet you, Shinji Ikari. Thank you. Target's current status? Target status unknown, EMI too strong. You saw that explosion! It must have been obliterated! Sensors coming back online. Energy readings at ground zero! What?! Visual feed back online. That was our ace in the hole... This can't be happening. ***-d***** monster! Yes, not to worry. His protection has top priority. So have the car shuttle train standing by. The direct service line. Right. Well, I am the one who said I would go meet him. So I'm keeping my word. Bye. Man, what a day! I just had this car restored, and it's trashed already! Repair fees, on top of another 33 months of car payments... Plus, my best outfit is ruined! -Um, Ms. Misato? -I got all decked out for today... -Excuse me, Ms. Misato? -Yes, what? Was it okay for you to do that? Oh, don't worry about it! This is an emergency! I had to get the car moving, right? And I might not look it, but I'm an international civil servant. So it's perfectly legit! That's not very convincing. Oh, lighten up. For a kid with such a cute face, you sure are uptight. Am I? Oops! Are you mad? I'm so sorry! You're a boy, after all. Actually, you seem a bit childish for someone your age, Ms. Misato. As we predicted, it's regenerating? If it couldn't, it would be worthless as a standalone weapon. Very impressive. It's even capable of enhancing its abilities? And it's getting smarter. It's only a matter of time before it resumes its advance. Gates closing. Please stay clear. Special Agency Nerv? Right. It's a secret organization directly attached to the UN. My father works here, doesn't he? Yup. Do you know what your father does here? A teacher told me that he has the important job of protecting humanity. As of this moment, you have been given command over this operation. -Let's see what you can do. -Understood, sir. Ikari, I'll admit that our ordnance is ineffective against the target. Can you defeat it, though? This is what Nerv is for. Don't let us down. Target status has not changed. Current intercept capacity is at 7.5%. The UN Forces have given up, then? What do you intend to do? We'll activate Unit 01. Unit 01? But there's no pilot. Not a problem. The spare pilot will arrive shortly. Will we be going to see my father? Yes, I think so. Father... Oh, right! Did your father send you any ID forms? Yes. Here. Thanks. COME HERE! -GENDOH IKARI Read through this, okay? "Welcome to Nerv"? My father's work... Am I supposed to do something at Nerv? There has to be. Otherwise, Father wouldn't have written to me. Oh, I see. Dealing with your father isn't your strong suit, huh? Just like me, huh? Wow! -A bona fide Geo-front! -That's right. Over there is our secret base, Nerv headquarters. The key to rebuilding the world, and the last bastion of humanity. This is so strange... I could swear it was this way. Closed Central Dogma passages will remain... Wearing skirts in this place is a bad idea. I wonder where Ritsuko went? I'm sorry, I don't have my bearings yet. We passed through here already. Well, not to worry! Nerv has systems for this very situation. Paging Project E. Dir., Dr. Ritsuko Akagi of Technology Division Section 1. Dr. Ritsuko Akagi. Please contact Capt. Misato Katsuragi of Operations Division Section 1. I don't believe it. She's lost again, isn't she? Oops! Hi, Ritsuko! Where have you been, Capt. Katsuragi? We're short on both manpower and time. Sorry! This is the boy? Yep. He's the Third Children reported by the Marduk Institute. Nice to meet you. Uh, yes, ma'am. That's another way that he takes after his father. A total lack of charm. Take care of things here. They haven't seen each other in three years. Deputy Commander, the target has begun moving again. Very well. All personnel to condition one battle stations. I repeat, condition one battle stations! Prepare for ground intercept. -Hear that? -This sounds bad. So, how is Unit 01? It's being cooled down in its Type B Configuration. It that thing really going to work? It's hasn't worked once, right? The odds of a successful activation are 0.000000001%. Calling it the 0-9 System was certainly appropriate. Doesn't that mean it won't work? Don't be rude. It's not 0%. Sure, numerically. Ah, well. We don't exactly have the luxury of accepting failure. Um, I can't see a thing! A face? A giant robot! You won't find this in the orientation book. This is the ultimate multipurpose decisive combat weapons system created by man. The Artificial Human Evangelion. Unit 01 of the series. Built in complete secrecy, this is mankind's very last trump card. -This is part of my father's work? -Correct. It's been a while. Father... Launch the Eva. Launch the Eva? But Unit 00 is still grounded! Wait, you want to use Unit 01?! There's no other choice. Wait just a second! Rei's in no condition for that! It's got no pilot! He just arrived. Are you serious? -Shinji Ikari. -Yes? You're going to pilot it. But it took even Rei Ayanami seven months to synchronize with her Eva! He literally just got here! He couldn't possibly do it! All I ask is that he sit in the cockpit. Nothing more. But... Repelling that Angel is our number one priority right now. For that, we need anyone capable of synchronizing with an Eva to try, however remote the chances. I shouldn't need to tell you this, Capt. Katsuragi. You're right. Father... Why did you send for me? For the reason you're thinking. So you want me to get inside this and fight that thing out there? Correct. I don't want to do that! Why send for me after all this time?! I thought you left me because you didn't need me! I do now, so I sent for you. But why me? Because it's impossible for anyone else. It is for me, too. I've never seen or heard of this thing before. I can't possibly do it! Learn how. That's... That's impossible! There's no way I can pilot this! If you're going to pilot it, do it. Otherwise, get out! That b****** must have figured out where we are. Shinji, we don't have much time. Get in. No way. I just got here! This is crazy! Tell me, Shinji. Why did you come? Don't run away! Not from your father, and especially not from yourself. I know! But there's no way I can do this! Fuyutsuki. Wake up Rei. Is she viable? She isn't dead. Understood. -Rei? -Yes? The backup isn't working out. I need you again. Yes, sir. Rewrite Unit 01's core system for Rei! Reactivate! Roger. Suspending current tasks and initiating reactivation. I knew it... No one wants me. Look out! -The Eva moved! -What the heck? Its right arm broke free of its restraints! What?! That can't be! It doesn't have an entry plug inserted! It's incapable of moving! It reacted without any interface connection? Or was it trying... to protect him? This will work. Don't run away. I'll do it. I'll be the pilot! -Cooling cycle complete! -Right arm reattachment complete. All gear inside cage is in docked position. Shutdown signal plug extraction complete. Roger. Inserting entry plug. -Plug locked in position. -Initiating level one connection. Flooding entry plug. Huh? What is this stuff? Don't worry, once your lungs are filled with LCL, it will feed oxygen directly into your bloodstream. You'll get used to it in no time. This is so gross. Deal with it! You're a big boy! -Main power connection complete! -Feeding power to all circuits! Roger! Initiating level two contact. A10 nerve connection, status green. Cognitive configuration base rules set to Japanese. Initial contact shows all green. Opening bilateral circuit. Synchronization rate at 41.3%. -Amazing... -Harmonics are all at normal levels. -No signs of a runaway. -We're good to go! Prepare for launch! Prepare for launch! Release lockdown bolt no. 01! Release confirmed! Initiating umbilical bridge retraction! Release lockdown bolt no. 02! Retracting primary restraining frame. Removing secondary restraining frame, as well. Disengaging safety systems one through 15. Internal power source, fully charged. External power source connecter shows green. Roger. Transport Eva-01 to launch bay. Launch path clear! All stations green! Launch preparations complete! Roger that! -Do we have a go, sir? -Absolutely. Unless we defeat the Angels, humanity has no future. Ikari, you're really sure about this? Launch! Shinji... don't die. TO BE CONTINUED NEXT EPISODE The Eva defeats the Angel, but that was just the beginning. Shinji runs away from his father. Misato's arrogance makes her decide to try to save him.
