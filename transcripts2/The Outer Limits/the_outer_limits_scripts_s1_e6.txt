 The Outer Limits (1995–2002): Season 1, Episode 6 - The Choice - full transcript 
 Ten year-old Aggie Travers is expelled from school after several incidents involving other students. She's very bright but her behavioral problems lead the school to determine she is a danger to the other students. Aggie's problem is that she has telekinetic powers but doesn't know how to control them. Her parents decide to hire a full time caregiver, Karen Ross, who it turns out has powers similar to Aggie's. Karen gives Aggie a crystal to help her focus her powers but when government agents arrive looking for her, Aggie's parents must decide what is in her best interest.

 IT IS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT CAUSE CONFLICTS-- DIFFERENCES IN RELIGION, IN RACE, IN BELIEFS. WHAT WARS WOULD BE FOUGHT IF THE DIFFERENCES GREW BETWEEN TWO INTELLIGENT SPECIES-- HUMANS AND THOSE WHO MIGHT ULTIMATELY REPLACE US? ( Principal ) THIS IS THE FIFTH INCIDENT IN AS MANY WEEKS. ONE GIRL CLAIMS TO HAVE BEEN PUSHED OFF THE SLIDE. ONE CLASSROOM LOOKED LIKE THE TASMANIAN DEVIL HAD GONE THROUGH IT. AGGIE CLAIMS TO HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. WE REALIZE THAT AGGIE HAS SOME EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS. WE'RE DEALING WITH IT. IF YOU COULD RECONSIDER. GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE? THE PROBLEM IS THE OTHER PARENTS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE'RE PUTTING THEIR CHILDREN INTO AN UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT AND WE'RE LEGALLY LIABLE. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO INSIST THAT AGGIE BE REMOVED. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU WANT US TO PUT HER IN REFORM SCHOOL? SHE'S A KID. I SUGGEST A SCHOOL FOR SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN. SPECIAL NEEDS? MY DAUGHTER ISN'T RETARDED. NO ONE'S SAYING THAT. WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS DISCUSSION IF NOT FOR HER BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS. WE'D PUT HER INTO ANOTHER GRADE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, HER BEHAVIOR IS DESTRUCTIVE, IT'S UNCONTROLLABLE AND-- AND WHAT? DANGEROUS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. DANGEROUS? WE KNOW AGGIE HAS PROBLEMS. SHE MAKES A MESS EVERY NOW AND AGAIN, BUT SHE DOESN'T LIE TO US. SHE NEVER HURT ANYONE. CLARK HOWELL DID NOT HIT HIMSELF. I'M SORRY, I HAVE TO SUSPEND AGGIE FROM SCHOOL FOR THE NEXT TWO WEEKS-- UNTIL THE END OF TERM. THIS IS RIDICULOUS. YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO MY CHILD. THE OTHER PARENTS AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN FILE SUIT, YOU KNOW. SO, IS SHE IN BED YET? ALMOST. IT'S SO HARD, JOE. SHE WON'T TALK TO ME AT ALL. IT'S THE SAME FOR ME. SHE CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WON'T BELIEVE HER. SHE ACTUALLY FEELS BETRAYED. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH HER? I DON'T KNOW. I THINK WE SHOULD GET SOMEONE FOR AGGIE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "GET SOMEONE"? WELL, A FULL-TIME LIVE-IN. SOMEONE WHO CAN TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF US. SOMEONE AT WORK SAID THERE'S A NEW AGENCY IN TOWN. MAYBE THEY HAVE SOMEONE WHO DEALS IN PROBLEM KIDS. WE CAN'T AFFORD IT RIGHT NOW. WE CAN'T NOT AFFORD IT! WE DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE. LET'S SAY WE FIND SOMEONE. HOW LONG COULD WE KEEP THEM? HAVING A KID WHO HITS OTHER CHILDREN AND LIES. WE DON'T KNOW THAT. JOE, PLEASE. EVERY TIME SOMETHING BREAKS AGGIE SAYS SHE DIDN'T DO IT. LESLIE, I'M NOT TRYING TO ARGUE. I'M JUST TRYING TO WORK THIS THING OUT. ( knocking on door ) AGGIE, UNLOCK THE DOOR. AGGIE? DON'T DO THIS, AGGIE. AGGIE, OPEN THIS DOOR! OH, MY GOD. AGGIE, WHAT IS THIS? EVERYTHING JUST STARTED SHAKING. BY ITSELF? LOOK AT THIS MESS! JOE, YOU'RE FRIGHTENING HER. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP! I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENS. WHY DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME? AGGIE. DAMN IT, JOE. ( crash ) OH, GOD. AGGIE? ( phone ringing ) ANTIQUARIUS BOOKS, RUTH SPEAKING. JEAN, DO WE HAVE ANY PAPERBACK COPIES OF THAT NEW MARGARET ATWOOD NOVEL? WE'LL BE GETTING IN A COUPLE LATER THIS WEEK. CHECK WITH US FRIDAY. YOU'RE WELCOME. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT. DO WHAT? REMEMBER ALL THESE THINGS WHILE YOU'RE READING ALL THOSE NEWSPAPERS. I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO CHANGE GEARS. THIS IS JEAN. I'VE GOT ANOTHER PROSPECT FOR YOU. SARAH AND RACHEL ARE BUSY WITH OTHERS. THE LOCATION IS EUGENE, OREGON. THE FAMILY'S NAME IS TRAVIS. ARE YOU ALL HERE FOR THE LIVE-IN JOB? I THOUGHT I WAS EARLY. WE HAD THE SAME IDEA. ABOUT GETTING HERE EARLY, I MEAN. IT'S PRETTY TOUGH NOWADAYS WITH ALL THE COMPETITION. WE ALL WANTED TO MAKE A FIRST IMPRESSION. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. I'M PROBABLY THE MOST QUALIFIED. I HAVE A DEGREE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT FROM BROWN. I LIKE YOUR DRESS. THANK YOU. OW, MAN. YOU ALL RIGHT? I GET THESE MIGRAINES. I'LL BE O. K. ARE YOU SURE? OH... MAYBE NOT. EXCUSE ME. I LIKE YOUR DRESS. WE'RE READY TO SEE THE FIRST... HI, I'M KAREN ROSS. OH, UH, HI, I'M--I'M JOE. COME ON IN, COME ON IN. I COME FROM A LARGE FAMILY, AND I LOVE KIDS. THERE WERE EIGHT OF US. I WAS THE OLDEST, SO I HELPED OUT A LOT. YOU HAVE JUST THE ONE CHILD? AGGIE. SHE'S 10. WE SHOULD TELL YOU... THERE'VE BEEN SOME PROBLEMS. WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS? AGGIE IS JUST A LITTLE... WELL, AT FIRST THE DOCTORS THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE ATTENTION DEFICIENT DISORDER. IT COULD BE WORSE THAN THAT. SHE GETS A LITTLE... WELL, WE'VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS AT SCHOOL INVOLVING OTHER KIDS. AND SOMETIMES SHE BREAKS THINGS. SHE BREAKS THINGS? HER TOYS AND SOMETIMES DISHES. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. BUT SHE'S A NICE KID. I'D LIKE TO MEET HER. OF COURSE. EXCUSE ME. KAREN, HAVE A SEAT. UM, YOUR LAST JOB, WHY DID YOU LEAVE? THE FAMILY MOVED TO HAWAII. THERE'S A NUMBER THERE. TWO LITTLE BOYS, THEY WERE ADORABLE. AGGIE, THIS IS KAREN. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. AGGIE'S A PRETTY NAME. IS IT SHORT FOR ANYTHING? AGATHA? AGORAPHOBIA? HEY, I'VE GOT AN IDEA. WHY DON'T YOU SHOW ME YOUR ROOM? THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. GO AHEAD, HONEY. THIS IS PRETTY. WHAT A COOL BED. I USED TO LOVE TO BOUNCE ON MY BED. I BET YOU COULD BOUNCE UP TO THE CEILING. OH, I USED TO HAVE A CLOWN JUST LIKE THAT WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE. CAN I SEE HER? PLEASE? I'LL SHOW YOU SOMETHING YOUR CLOWN CAN DO I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT. ( squeaky voice ) HI, AGGIE. OH, YOU DON'T LIKE OUR NEW FRIEND KAREN. I SURE DO. I CAN MAKE HER DANCE--WATCH. UM-PAH, UM-PAH, UM UM. YOU MUST THINK I'M 5. AGGIE? AGGIE, OPEN THE DOOR, PLEASE. GO AWAY! GO AWAY. DID I SCARE YOU? IF I SCARED YOU, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO. I ONLY MEANT TO SHOW YOU WHAT I CAN DO. WHY? YOU KNOW WHY, AGGIE. NO, I DON'T. YOU'RE JUST LIKE ME. YOU CAN DO THINGS. NO, I CAN'T. I'M NOT LIKE ANYBODY. YES, YOU ARE. THINGS JUST HAPPEN ON THEIR OWN WHEN YOU'RE AROUND, AND PEOPLE DON'T LIKE YOU BECAUSE OF IT. I DON'T MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. I'LL TEACH YOU HOW TO CONTROL YOUR POWER. I DON'T WANT TO CONTROL IT. I WANT IT TO GO AWAY! IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? EVERYTHING'S FINE. AGGIE AND I WILL GET ALONG JUST GREAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK? WOULD YOU LIKE KAREN TO STAY WITH US? AGGIE? IT'S UP TO YOU, SWEETHEART. DO YOU WANT KAREN TO STAY? I GUESS. WELL, THEN, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE A JOB. EXCELLENT. HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN MISSING, MR. HAGAN? THREE WEEKS. WE ALREADY WENT THROUGH THIS WITH THE POLICE. I'D THINK YOU'D HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO THAN TO QUESTION US OVER AND OVER. MY AGENCY CONDUCTS ITS OWN INVESTIGATIONS. WHAT AGENCY WAS THAT? THE FBI? NO, SIR. MY AGENCY HAS A SLIGHTLY NARROWER FOCUS THAN THE FBI. WE CONCENTRATE ON MISSING CHILDREN LIKE LUCY. WELL, SHE WAS WALKING HOME FROM SCHOOL. PEOPLE SAW HER LEAVING THE PLAYGROUND AND WAITING FOR THE BUS. AND THEN SHE WAS GONE. SHE WOULDN'T RIDE WITH SOMEBODY SHE DIDN'T KNOW. LUCY HAD TOO MUCH COMMON SENSE. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE WAS PICKED UP BY HER NANNY, MARTHA? NO, MARTHA WASN'T IN TOWN. TWO WEEKS BEFORE LUCY DISAPPEARED MARTHA HAD A FAMILY EMERGENCY AND HAD TO GO TO FLORIDA. ( Mr. Hagan ) YOU DON'T THINK MARTHA HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS. OH, MY GOD. IS THIS A PHOTO OF MARTHA? YES. NO, SHE... SHE COULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH... SHE LOVED LUCY. TELL ME EVERYTHING YOU CAN ABOUT MARTHA. SHE WAS NEW IN TOWN. SHE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS. SHE SAID SHE WAS AN ONLY CHILD. DID MARTHA EVER GIVE YOUR DAUGHTER A GIFT? A SMALL CRYSTAL? HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? DO YOU HAVE ANY RECORDS CONCERNING MARTHA? SOCIAL SECURITY FORMS, RESUMES, PHONE BILLS... ANYTHING THAT MIGHT TELL ME WHERE TO FIND HER. THERE'S SOMETHING. SHE WOULD GET PARCELS-- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WERE FROM HOME-- THAT HAD THIS PRETTY LABEL ON IT. IT WAS ANTIQUAR-- ANTIQUARIUS BOOKS. ANTIQUARIUS BOOKS. WHICH CITY? I JUST REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE STORE. WELL, I THINK THAT WILL HELP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WILL YOU FIND LUCY? IF IT'S NOT TOO LATE. OH, YEAH, IT'S WALSH HERE. PATCH ME TO SELMA. SELMA? I THINK I MIGHT HAVE A LEAD. I NEED THE LOCATION OF AN ANTIQUARIUS BOOKSTORE SOMEWHERE IN THE CONTINENTAL U. S. OH, AND GET ME A PLANE AND A CAR. I DON'T CARE HOW MANY THERE ARE. I'LL CHECK THEM ALL. ( phone ringing ) ANTIQUARIUS BOOKS, THIS IS JEAN. HI, IT'S ME. YOU SHOULD KNOW, I'VE MADE CONTACT AND WE DEFINITELY HAVE A POSITIVE-- A LITTLE GIRL NAMED AGGIE TRAVIS. GOOD. HOW SOON WILL SHE BE READY? THE MOTHER'S SUSPICIOUS, BUT I'M WORKING ON IT. IT WON'T BE LONG. SO, AGGIE, WHAT DO YOU LIKE TO DO? HMM. DO YOU HAVE ANY FRIENDS? NO. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS WITH ME. I DO. MY PARENTS PAY YOU. WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS, DOES IT? I USED TO GET THOSE HEADACHES, TOO. YOU DID? YEAH. ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS MAD. SOMETIMES I COULD SEE THIS GLOW AROUND PEOPLE AND IF I SQUEEZED IT DOWN TIGHT THINGS WOULD HAPPEN TO THEM. YOU WERE LIKE ME WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE? YOU'RE NOT ALONE, AGGIE. LOOK AT THE STRAW. HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT? I FOCUSED. I SQUEEZED THE LIGHT TO A POINT. YOU CAN FOCUS, TOO. IT GETS GOOFED UP WHEN I DO IT. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO. THIS WILL HELP YOU FOCUS. LOOK, I HAVE ONE, TOO. THINK ABOUT THE STRAW. I CAN'T. YES, YOU CAN. DON'T GET MAD. REALLY CONCENTRATE. THAT WAS CLOSER. TRY IT ONE MORE TIME. THINK ONLY OF THE STRAW. BLOCK EVERYTHING ELSE OUT. YOU'RE DOING THAT. NO, YOU'RE DOING THAT. THAT WAS EXCELLENT. WHEN YOU GOT MAD DID YOU HURT PEOPLE? I DID UNTIL I LEARNED HOW TO CONTROL IT. I DON'T WANT TO CONTROL IT. WHEN PEOPLE ARE MEAN TO ME I WANT THEM TO GET HURT. IT ISN'T RIGHT, AGGIE. WE DON'T USE OUR POWERS TO HURT PEOPLE. WHY NOT? BECAUSE NATURE DIDN'T GIVE US THESE POWERS TO HURT PEOPLE. ONCE YOU LEARN HOW TO FOCUS PEOPLE WON'T BE MEAN AS OFTEN. WE'LL PRACTISE EVERY DAY, JUST THE TWO OF US. EXCUSE ME. DO YOU HAVE ANY BOOKS ON THE HUMAN GENOME PROGRAM? I'LL SEE. JEAN, IS IT? THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING CRYSTAL YOU'RE WEARING, JEAN. WHERE WOULD I GET ONE JUST LIKE THAT? THIS IS ONE OF A KIND. NO, I THINK I'VE SEEN SEVERAL CRYSTALS JUST LIKE THAT. WHO ARE YOU? JUST A MAN WITH SOME QUESTIONS, JEAN. FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE IS LUCY HAGAN? OR A NANNY NAMED MARTHA? RUTH! RUTH, COME-- NO, NO, NO, LET ME TELL YOU... SHOULD I CALL THE POLICE? NO, DON'T BOTHER. BYE, JEAN. JEAN, IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO? JUST TELL EVERYONE I'LL BE GONE FOR A FEW DAYS. YEAH, I FOUND HER. FACE TO FACE WITH THE FAMOUS JEAN ANDERSON, WHICH IS WHAT SHE'S CALLING HERSELF THESE DAYS. NO, NO, I DIDN'T HAVE HER PICKED UP, BECAUSE SHE'S OVER 50. HER POWERS ARE SO DIMINISHED SHE ISN'T A THREAT. BUT SHE MAY LEAD US TO OTHERS, MAYBE EVEN SANCTUARY ITSELF. YEAH. HELLO? AGGIE? AGGIE, WHERE ARE YOU GUYS? AGGIE? AGGIE, WHERE ARE YOU? HI. OH, I WAS REALLY WORRIED. YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT ME A NOTE. I DID. IT'S IN THE KITCHEN. I SAID WE'D BE BACK BY NOW. IS THAT O. K.? YEAH, THAT'S FINE, FINE. DID YOU HAVE FUN, SWEETHEART? YEAH, I GUESS. YOU GUESS? THAT'S A LOT BETTER THAN NO. I REALLY LIKE KAREN. YOU DO? THAT'S GREAT... THAT'S GREAT. GO WASH UP, O. K.? O. K. WOW. YOU SEEM TO HAVE SOME KIND OF MAGIC. HI THERE. SOMEONE CAME HOME IN A GOOD MOOD. I AM IN A GOOD MOOD. WHY? I'M HAPPY BECAUSE AGGIE'S HAPPY. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER LIKE THIS IN A LONG TIME. IT WORKED. WHAT WORKED? KAREN. WHAT? DON'T YOU LIKE HER? YES, I LIKE HER. IT'S JUST... JUST...? SHE'S TOO PERFECT. IF SHE'S SO GOOD WHY HASN'T SHE STAYED WITH ANOTHER FAMILY FOR A LONG TIME? SHE DID. THOSE PEOPLE IN HAWAII. DIDN'T YOU CALL THEM? I SPOKE WITH THE MOTHER... JEAN. YEAH, AND WHAT DID JEAN SAY? WELL, ACCORDING TO HER, KAREN IS HEAVEN-SENT. HEAVEN-SENT? THAT'S A PROBLEM? SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. I THINK WE LUCKED OUT FOR ONCE. LET'S JUST ENJOY IT. JEAN, I CAME AS SOON AS I COULD. IT'S THE TRACKERS. THEY FOUND ME. OH, MY GOD. WHY DIDN'T THEY GRAB YOU? I DON'T KNOW. BUT THEY'LL FIND ME AGAIN, AND FIND YOU AND AGGIE. HOW IS SHE? SHE'S NOWHERE NEAR READY. WE CAN'T BE CONCERNED WITH THAT. BRING HER TO ME. I NEED MORE TIME. IF WE TAKE HER NOW SHE'LL NEVER REALLY TRUST US. IF THE TRACKER FINDS US, IT'S THE CAMP FOR HER, AND GOD KNOWS WHAT FOR YOU AND ME. I KNOW WE HAVE RULES BUT I'LL BREAK THEM ALL TO SAVE ONE LITTLE GIRL FROM THEIR EXPERIMENTS. I KNOW... I'M SORRY. I ONLY MEANT-- I'LL GIVE YOU TWO DAYS. 48 HOURS. THEN I WANT HER. THANK YOU. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN. WHERE WILL YOU BE? I'LL BE WATCHING. ( knocking on door ) YOU'RE GETTING REALLY GOOD. IT'S A LOT OF FUN. I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW MOMMY AND DADDY. AGGIE, YOU REALLY CAN'T SHOW MOMMY AND DADDY. THE POWER WE HAVE IS A SECRET. THE BIGGEST SECRET EVER. WHY? WELL, EVEN GROWN-UPS, EVEN MOMMIES AND DADDIES CAN ACT LIKE THOSE KIDS AT SCHOOL. THEY THINK WE CAN MAKE THEM DO THINGS AND THEY CAN'T STOP US. IT MAKES THEM AFRAID. AND SOMETIMES, IT MAKES THEM MEAN. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND MEAN PEOPLE, THOUGH. WHAT IF I TOLD YOU THERE WAS A PLACE, A SPECIAL PLACE, WHERE THERE WERE LOTS OF OTHER GIRLS JUST LIKE YOU. THAT'S WHERE I LIVE, AND IT'S CALLED SANCTUARY. IS IT A TOWN? SOMETIMES WE'RE IN A TOWN. SANCTUARY'S REALLY MORE OF A GROUP. WE MOVE AROUND TO STAY SAFE FROM BAD PEOPLE. WE TEACH EACH OTHER AND WE PROTECT EACH OTHER. AND WHEN WE'RE READY WE FIND OTHERS THAT NEED US. COOL. WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO? CAN I TAKE MOM AND DAD? NO, AGGIE. SANCTUARY ISN'T FOR THEM. WELL, THEN I GUESS IT'S NOT FOR ME EITHER. ALL RIGHT, I'M GETTING A GOOD DIRECTIONAL SIGNAL. IF YOU TAKE THE VAN DOWN 14th, YOU GET A FIX, WE'LL FINALLY BE ABLE TO TRIANGULATE. ALL RIGHT, OUT. OW! AGGIE, REMEMBER CONTROL. AGGIE IS SO MUCH BETTER, KAREN. IT'S THANKS TO YOU. YOU'RE A MIRACLE WORKER. NO, JUST IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. SHE'S JUST OUTGROWING HER PROBLEMS. EXCUSE ME. I HAVE TO GO TO THE LITTLE GIRLS' ROOM. O. K. ( Karen ) WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? ( Jean ) I'VE BEEN WATCHING. SHE HAS A LOT OF ANGER. YOU'VE TOLD HER ABOUT SANCTUARY? SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO. WITH THE TRACKERS THIS CLOSE WE CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER. AND TO HELL WITH OUR RULES? THE YEAR BEFORE I RESCUED YOU I FOUND THIS LITTLE GIRL IN MODESTO, CALIFORNIA. HER NAME WAS JOY. SHE WAS SO SMART, AND PRETTY. SHE WAS A LITTLE BALLERINA AND WAS ABLE TO FOCUS ENOUGH SO SHE COULD ALMOST FLY. JOY LOVED HER PARENTS, AND I WAS YOUNG. I DIDN'T SEE WHY I SHOULD TAKE HER AWAY FROM THEM. YEARS LATER I SAW HER AFTER THEY'D BEEN TESTING HER AT ONE OF THEIR CAMPS. WHEN THEY FINISHED, THEY NEUTRALIZED HER, WHICH IS A POLITE TERM FOR THEIR KIND OF ELECTRO-SHOCK. SHE COULD BARELY WALK, MUCH LESS DANCE. THEY KILLED WHAT MADE JOY SPECIAL. I'LL BE WAITING AT THE BURRARD MOTOR INN, CORNER OF BURRARD AND 3rd, ROOM 23. THAT WAS FUN. YEAH, THAT WAS FUN. CAN WE STAY LONGER? NO, SWEETHEART, WE'LL COME BACK NEXT WEEK. NEXT WEEK IS TOO FAR. AREN'T YOU TIRED? NO, I'M NOT TIRED. ALL THAT SUGAR. I'VE GOT AN IDEA. YOU TWO GO ON, AND WE'LL WALK. YEAH, MOM, CAN WE, PLEASE? PLEASE, MOMMY? THAT SOUNDS GOOD, SURE. MEET US BACK AT THE HOUSE. O. K.? YOU GOT IT. TAG, YOU'RE IT! HAVE FUN. LOOK AT HER. THIS IS GREAT. THAT'S OUR NEW LITTLE GIRL. OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS, JOE. HELLO, JEAN. YOU FOLLOWED ME FROM PARKVIEW. ACTUALLY, I FOLLOWED A TRANSPONDER. I ATTACHED IT TO YOUR PURSE IN THE BOOKSTORE. THEN WHERE ARE THE OTHERS? OH, THEY'LL BE HERE SHORTLY. MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE THIS MUCH LESS UNPLEASANT AND SIMPLY TELL ME WHERE MARTHA IS. AND I KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL INVOLVED. WHAT'S HER NAME? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT, JEAN. BY THE END OF THE DAY WE'LL HAVE YOUR ASSISTANT KIDNAPPER AND THE GIRL. AND ONE OTHER THING-- THE LOCATION OF SANCTUARY. WE'LL HAVE YOUR PEOPLE IN THE CAMP BY THE END OF THE WEEK. GENERATIONS OF WOMEN LIKE ME HAVE BEEN HUNTED BY MEN LIKE YOU. YOU USED TO BURN US AT THE STAKE. NOW YOU JUST NEUTRALIZE US. ALL BECAUSE WE COULD DO THINGS YOU COULDN'T. YOU'RE SO AFRAID OF BEING REPLACED, LIKE THE NEANDERTHALS. THE WAY YOU'VE ACTED, YOU DESERVE TO BE REPLACED. OH, MANY TIMES I'VE WISHED WE COULD FIGHT BACK. BUT THAT ISN'T OUR WAY. I'LL DIE BEFORE I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DIE, JEAN. YOU ARE GOING TO DO A LOT OF TALKING. KAREN, HOW COME I CAN DO THINGS? YOU HAVE A Z CHROMOSOME. ONLY A FEW WOMEN HAVE IT. MAYBE ONE IN A MILLION. IT'S A KEY TO BEING ABLE TO FOCUS. WELL, YOU HAVE A Z CHROMOSOME, TOO, DON'T YOU? YES. I'M NOT AS STRONG AS YOU, THOUGH. THE OLDER YOU GET THE WEAKER YOUR POWERS GET. SO, HOW DID IT HAPPEN? WE WERE JUST BORN WITH IT. SOME MEN HAVE AN EXTRA Y CHROMOSOME. IT'S NATURE'S WAY OF TRYING SOMETHING NEW. MAYBE IN 500 YEARS WE'LL ALL HAVE Zs. IF IT MAKES ME SO DIFFERENT HOW COME THEY JUST CAN'T TAKE IT OUT? WELL, IT'S TOO SMALL TO EVEN SEE, MUCH LESS TAKE OUT. HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO STAY AT OUR HOUSE? WE'LL SEE. THAT'S NOT A REAL ANSWER. LET'S GO OVER THIS WAY. ALL RIGHT, I SEE YOU. I'VE GOT THE WOMAN IN CUSTODY. TAKE UP POSITIONS AND STAND BY. WAIT FOR MY CALL. ( thud ) DAMN IT. CYANIDE. FRONT DESK. COULD YOU TELL ME IF ANY CALLS WERE MADE FROM THIS ROOM? UM, ROOM 23. GOOD... I'LL BE RIGHT OVER. SO, WHAT WILL YOU BE WHEN YOU GROW UP? I'M ALREADY GROWN UP. I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE REALLY OLD, LIKE 30. UM, I ALWAYS WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE? A MOUNTAIN CLIMBER. I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH MONEY IN THAT. YOU JUST WANT TO BE ALONE. SO DID I, BUT YOU CAN'T. HEY, THIS ISN'T THE WAY HOME. I JUST WANT TO SEE A FRIEND. IS THAT O. K.? ALL RIGHT. IS SHE NICE? ARE WE ALMOST THERE? STAY HERE A MINUTE, AGGIE. JEAN? OH, JEAN. AGGIE, WAIT. AGGIE, COME BACK. LET ME EXPLAIN. MR. AND MRS. JOSEPH TRAVIS? YEAH. SPECIAL AGENT WALSH. I'M HERE ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER. IS THERE A PROBLEM? IS THIS YOUR NANNY? DOES SHE GO BY THE NAME OF MARTHA? WELL, THAT'S HER, BUT HER NAME'S KAREN. DID KAREN EVER GIVE YOUR CHILD A GIFT? YES. HAS SHE DONE SOMETHING? WAS IT A CRYSTAL ON A NECK CHAIN? YES, IT WAS. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? MY AGENCY KNOWS A GREAT DEAL ABOUT THIS KAREN. SHE KIDNAPS CHILDREN. WHAT? MOMMY. BABY, WHAT HAPPENED? HELLO, AGGIE, MY NAME'S TERRY. CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE KAREN IS? AT THE OTHER PLACE. WHAT OTHER PLACE? THAT'S ENOUGH QUESTIONS FOR NOW. AGGIE, GO UPSTAIRS. WHO IS HE? DO AS YOUR MOTHER SAYS. I'LL COME GET YOU. WHO IS HE? AGGIE! WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? I'M SORRY, I'LL NEED AGGIE'S HELP. WHEN SHE'S CALMED DOWN I'LL GET HER TO COME DOWN TO THE OFFICE. SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. THERE'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. MY SECTION FINDS THEM. HOW DO YOU MEAN DANGEROUS? BECAUSE THEY'RE DIFFERENT. THEY PREY ON INNOCENT LITTLE GIRLS LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER. THEY CAN'T BE CONTROLLED OR STOPPED AND THEY DON'T FOLLOW RULES. RULES THAT LET YOU HUNT GIRLS LIKE AGGIE? KAREN. KAREN, WHAT'S GOING ON? THERE'S THESE PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT THAT STUDIED WOMEN LIKE ME, LIKE AGGIE. THEY GOT AFRAID OF WHAT THEY FOUND. THEY CONVINCED THEMSELVES THAT WE WERE A THREAT. YOU ARE A THREAT. YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN? ( Karen ) WHY DO YOU THINK I CAME BACK HERE? HE KILLED MY BEST FRIEND. I CAME BACK BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT AGGIE. SHE'S LYING! AGGIE HAS THIS POWER. IT'S SOMETHING SHE'S BORN WITH. SHUT UP! NO, AGGIE. AGGIE, DON'T KILL HIM. HE HURT YOU. YOU'LL BE AS BAD AS THEY ARE. MY GOD. HE'S NOT DEAD. WHERE AM I? WHO ARE YOU? I'M AGGIE TRAVIS. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? TERRY... IT'S TERRY. WHAT AM I DOING HERE? AGGIE, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HIM? I... ERASED THE BAD PARTS. MORE MEN FROM WALSH'S AGENCY WILL BE HERE. WE'VE ONLY BOUGHT A FEW MOMENTS. THEN YOU HAVE TO GO? I HAVE TO TAKE AGGIE WITH ME. YOU CAN'T TAKE HER, SHE'S OUR LITTLE GIRL. I WISH I COULD DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE THIS. JOE, YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED. A MAN CAME INTO OUR HOUSE TO TAKE AGGIE AWAY. WE'LL HIDE HER. THEY'LL FIND YOU. DAD, I HAVE TO BE WITH PEOPLE LIKE ME. OH, BABY. I'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER. SHE NEEDS TO BE SAFE, JOE. YOU'LL ALWAYS BE DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL. YOU PROMISE YOU'LL COME BACK SOMEDAY SOON. I LOVE YOU, DADDY. I LOVE YOU TOO, HONEY. THE WARS OF EVOLUTION ARE FOUGHT OVER GENERATIONS. BUT SOMETIMES, ONLY THE FITTEST SURVIVE BATTLES WHICH LAST THE BRIEFEST MOMENTS. 100 YEARS FROM NOW, A NEW RACE MAY LOOK BACK AND SAY THIS LITTLE GIRL'S STAND WAS A TURNING POINT.
