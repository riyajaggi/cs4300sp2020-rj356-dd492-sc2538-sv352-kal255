 What an honor to be before you. The Nobel Prize. You must know, I didn't do it alone. Although, research is a lonely business. But I must- I must share this with my family... my wonderful family- my wife, my son. Would you please stand? To be honored in your presence is a very humbling experience. To be in the presence of those scientific ghosts from the past... Darwin, Einstein. Yes, sir!

 This way. - Good morning, Dr. Kress. - Good morning, Clarise. Transportation Security to Sublevel 4. - Anything new for me? - MI scan detects 67 new eggs. - Is that right? - If gestation periods hold constant... we'll have a new generation by 2300 hours. Virile little suckers. All right! Up and at 'em, boys. It might be midnight on Mars... but it's sure as hell mornin' here. Maintain steady lightning intervals. Okay. Let's see what we got. Nothin' new in 51. Let's go next door.

 26W is the same. No population increase there. That's very nice. There. Wait, wait. Bring up the terrain GIF's from last night's sweep. I want a full comparison. All security personnel. Organism detected, Level 3! - Decontam Sector 4! - Level 3? That's almost surface. Intercept and neutralize! Neutralize? I've gotta get into the ventilation system. But that's a closed system! That's impossible! They can't annihilate them. I've spent five years with these bugs! - Dr. Kress? - I can retrieve it! This is a quarantine event! You're in violation of procedure! There he is! Get him! Stop, now! Dr. Kress! Dr. Kress! He's headin' for the east wing! Let's go! Okay, where are ya? I know you're in here. Where are you? - There you are! - There he is! - Someone spot it? - Wait! Get away from him! He's mine! - This one's mine! - No. No! You have no right to do this! No! There is nothing wrong with your television. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are now controlling the transmission. We control the horizontal... and the vertical. We can deluge you with a thousand channels... or expand one single image to crystal clarity... and beyond. We can shape your vision... to anything our imagination can conceive. We will control all that you see and hear. You are about to experience the awe and mystery... which reaches from the deepest inner mind to... The Outer Limits. Some of man's greatest achievements... have been motivated by a driving need for love and acceptance. What happens when that need for recognition... becomes a desire to be revered... and then worshipped like a god? Dave, what the hell was I supposed to do? Simon, that damn thing was practically topside. - He got to Level 3. That's hardly topside. - He was practically topside. That is close enough. I suppose the government suits want a whole new decon routine implemented? No, we never talked about that. They don't want a procedural review, do they? You know what that would do to the timetable. They're shutting us down. They want the remaining life-forms cryoed... and transferred immediately to deep-store in Nevada... and all research consolidated and classified as priority sense one. - They can't. - It's over. The whole thing's toast. They can't do this to me. I created them. They're mine. Everyone acknowledges your contributions, Simon. Contributions? I created life! If it weren't for me, you'd still be sittin' on a bunch of dried-up eggs... as dead as the rest of the Martian soil brought back by that damned Mars Lander! - I'm filing a report. - There's no one left to file to. This whole thing comes from the president of the United States. - You can't go over his head. - Then I'll go to the public! Don't talk like that. Don't even joke about it. Simon, an alien organism... came within 20 feet of contaminating the Earth's biosphere! The M-17 biotics are not just organisms. Do you have any idea what kind of a shit-scare that caused in Washington? They're not just organisms. They're intelligent beings. That's just conjecture. You know it as well as I do. The organism that those idiots incinerated was the latest generation. He learned how to evade the security measures. - Don't you know what that means? - Yes. That they're very unsafe. And unfortunately, the committee feels the same about you. You're not being reassigned. So... after nine years, you're just gonna fire me, and that's it? Look, I'm sorry. What's your next move, Dave? Maybe in a couple of years... you might just resurrect the project, this time with you at the helm? I'm not gonna reward that with a response, Simon... except to say that any breach of security will mark you as a high risk. - What's that supposed to mean? - Don't find out. You scared me to death. You're home early. We're in a holding pattern on some tests. You know I don't like you to look at my stuff before it's done. Didn't see a thing. So those are the new windows for the courthouse, huh? Well, they will be if city council approves my design. They'll be lucky to get you. Thank you. - Did you seeJosh? - No. - Well, I'm worried about him. - Why? 'Cause he spends too much time alone in the dark. So do I. - But he's 10. It's not normal. - Cheers. Who's normal? - You okay? - Why? 'Cause you seem kind of out of it, more than usual. I'm just a little burned out, that's all. - Your dad's coming for dinner tonight. - Wonderful. He called. He wants to seeJosh. He's lonely, Simon. That's because no one can stand to be around him for more than 15 minutes. The deadly reign of Arachnothoid... has begun! Dad, Mom, this stuff looks awesome! - Great. - When do we get to see it? Not till I add the music and sound effects. See, there's the problem. Three perfectionists in one household. - I'll get it! - Good. - Make that four. - Hi, Grandpa! Hi there, champ. Got a surprise for ya! - I don't know if I'm ready for this. - Cool! Look what Grandpa got me! Come on! I know, I know. You didn't want me to get him one. But the little guy kept eying me from the store window. - I just couldn't resist. - We gotta talk about this. Tell me that is not a real dog in my living room. - You will learn to love him, Cathy. - This is a very bad idea. No, it isn't. Every boy should have a dog. But- Cathy works, I work, and- Who's gonna take care of him? I mean, Josh- - You can't count on Josh to take care- - He'll be great forJosh. - It'll help make him more sociable. - I love him, Grandpa. - What's his name? - You're gonna have to give him one. You were saying? So, they still working on that- What do you call it? That moon rock thing- - Not moon rocks. Martian soil samples. - Brought back by the Mars Lander. And you're doin' some sort of research on 'em, right? We're studying how Earth life interacts with Martian terrain. It's amazing how the government spends our money these days. Yeah, there's never a good war around when you need one, huh, Colonel? It's too bad we're not invading someone. That'd be a shot in the arm to the old economy. Josh, you're not feeding that dog, are you? - But he's real hungry, Mom. - I know. Your grandpa brought you a big bag of dog food. It's out on the porch. You wanna feed him, get a handful of that. Come on. Looks like your present is a big hit. You know, kids and dogs, they're made for each other. What was the name of that dog you had when you were a kid, Simon? Cowboy. And he wasn't mine. He was David's. - He was? - Yeah, he was. Yeah, that's right. You didn't care much for pets, did you? But David sure did. Yeah, I remember now. He really suffered when Cowboy died. How did Cowboy die? He dug a hole under the fence, got into some traffic. Well, I sure hope we're not setting Josh up for a trauma like that. Trauma is a part of life. The sooner a boy is introduced to it, the sooner he'll be able to deal with it. Now, when David finally came out of his room... a small part of him had become a man. MaybeJosh'll get lucky, and his dog'll get hit by a car. - I'll see you later, champ. - Bye, Grandpa. How about this for a name? - Cowboy. - Cowboy? Cool. Cowboy! Hey, thanks for that good dinner, Cathy. - It's my pleasure. - You better take some time off from work. - You seem a little stressed. - Maybe I will. Get rid of that damned ponytail. Well, he's a grown man, for God's sake. What a guy. I just think you could've handled it better. I've been handling it all my life, Cath. - Never changes. - I know. But he's your father, and he's old. He's only old when it comes to me. He knew whose dog it was. You think he can't remember where I work? He just loves to piss on what I do. I'm not David. Didn't make the all-star team in Little League. Didn't win any trophies for swimming and football. Didn't become an F-4 pilot. Didn't die for my country. Just read my books... kept to myself. Big disappointment to him. I don't think that you are a disappointment. I think he's proud of you. I just- Men like him don't know how to express themselves. I don't need his approval. Maybe he's waitin' for you to get a Nobel Prize. Simon says give me a kiss. Take your clothes off. Didn't say, "Simon says." Let there be light. And there was. Dr. Kress is coming through. - Affirmative. - Move that truck right over there. I'm sorry. Damn it! Clear it with Stockley! Why are you here? - I wanna supervise the cryo-storage. - That's not necessary at all. They've got extremely capable personnel working on it. I'm sure they do, but this is my work. If something goes wrong... they're gonna point the finger at me, and maybe you. Nothing's gonna go wrong, Simon. Dave, if they're gonna close the book on my life... at least let me make sure it's done right. Listen, last night, I said some things I didn't mean. - Forget it. - Just let me do this. All right? Tomorrow, I'll be history. Okay. All right. But you just supervise only. Simon, this could mean my ass. Supervise only. That takes care of the mobiles. Prepare for transport. I'll alert Team Two that the soil is ready for purging. We're clear. Dr. Kress, please return to Security. - Yeah. - The lunch box, please. The thermos too. No problem. - Thank you. - Waste of good coffee. I believe you have something that belongs to us. Your I D tag. They said you forgot to turn it in. Yeah. Thanks. Now, listen, if there's anything you need... anything at all, don't hesitate to call. - You'll be the first. - Okay. Welcome home. Entry number one. Have established visual confirmation of the presence of eggs... within the soil. The next stage will be to introduce the embryos... into a controlled environment. Viability, of course, depends on fac- - Other than that, school was okay? - Yep. Why don't you take Cowboy out back? Let him run around for a little while. - Bet he could use it after the vet. - Okay. Come on, Cowboy. Come on. Hi, honey. Come on, Cowboy. Where are you going? Hey, you're home early. What happened? Nothing happened. What? - Something happened, didn't it? - A little downtime with the equipment. I didn't wanna lose momentum, so I'm doing some of the research at home. - Where, in the barn? - Yeah. - You're joking. - Actually, it's not a bad place to work. You're not doing anything dangerous in there, are you? What are you talking about? How'd the presentation go? It's on Thursday. Today is- - Monday. - Is that my stained glass? I used some of the stuff you were gonna throw out to patch up the windows. - Looks good, huh? - Yes, but this is really not what- Don't worry. Relax. I won't give up my day job. The reign of Arachnothoid has ended! Long live the canine-o-saur! Cowboy, your career is over. Dad? - Josh, what are you doing in here? - I was looking for you. - Come on! - I need some help with my movie. - I don't want you going in there. - Why? Because I'm doing some very important work. I don't wanna see you in the barn again. Do you understand? - Why can't I help? - Because you can't. That's the end of it. And I don't want you telling your mom what you saw in there. Okay? - You hear me? - Yeah. - It's a surprise. - Surprise? - Yeah. - Sure. Okay, go on. Make your movie. Cowboy, come. You're still my best buddy. You know that, don't ya? Afternoon, Simon. - Missed me already, huh? - You could say that. You keepin' busy? Taking some time off, doin' a little soul-searching. That's good. Good. You know, I'm doing a little searching myself. What for? A new job? No. 265 grams of Martian soil. I hate to break it to you, but you're on the wrong planet. 265 grams. That was the discrepancy that the mass comparison analysis found... when we transferred the habitat to storage. Maybe one of those crack technicians you hired made off with a souvenir. Well, the agency boys put it down to computation error... but I just think they were in a mad rush to wrap it up as quick as they could. You know me and my figures. If they don't match up... it just gets me wondering. Guess there's a small part of scientist in me after all. I've always said that, Dave. A very small part. Did you steal that soil sample? - Why the hell would I want to do that? - There were eggs in that soil. I get all the eggs I need from the supermarket. Cut the crap and give me a straight answer. All right, I'll give you one. You got your head up your ass. My interest in the project ended when I drove off the compound for the last time. You're nothin' but a shitty memory to me. You and the agency. Is that straight enough for ya? Yeah. I'm still truly sorry what happened to you... but you're makin' it awful tough to stay on the same team. See you. Log entry number seven. I estimate a total of 10 hatchings... and anticipate 30 more within the next 10 hours. The activity within the environment continues to intensify... and I'm ready to commence regular feeding. I expect the first mobile... will break the surface in a week. I believe that the Sandkings... can attain intelligence. I define this by the ability to reason. I can prove this. Son, I told you. This is off-limits. I know, Dad, but we gotta talk. Give me a few more minutes. I'm right in the middle of something. But how can we be best buddies if we never hang out together? - Just let me finish my work. - You always say that. It never happens. Buddy? Hey, buddy. - Don't walk away mad. - Forget that "buddy" stuff. Son, don't walk away from me when I'm talkin' to you. What do you want? I wanna spend time with you. I just- - Don't worry about it. - Son? Can you keep a secret? Yeah? Why? I need you to help me with something. But you're gonna have to do exactly as you're told. Serious business. What are you talking about? How would you like to help me out in the barn? Yes! No, the date I've always been working with is Thursday. Well- Nobody ever told me anything except Thursday. Well, I guess it doesn't matter much what they told me. You need something today. No, no, it's not a problem... 'cause my husband's here, and he can watch my son. It won't be a full rendering that I would be showing you- Right. Okay. So I'll be there in an hour and a half. Great. Bye. Trace him, trace him. Over there. That's right. Got a good shot there? - Yeah. Recording. - You sure it's in focus? Dad, please. I'm not a tourist. It's important that it's recorded clearly. You handle your worms, I'll handle the photography. - Move the camera up to me in a close-up. - Why? Will you give me the close-up? Right here? Okay, the organisms will now be given... one cube of synthesized protein. They don't seem too interested. - What else do they eat? - Practically anything. How about Mrs. Thompson's cat? I don't think so. Now proceeding to the live subject. There you are. You sure you wanna watch this? Man your camera. All right. Bombs away. Bombs away. What are they? They're very special. I call them Sandkings. They're from very far away. - I think they share a hive mind. - What's that? Well, it means they kind of work together... but they're controlled by one individual, most likely the queen. Like bees and ants? The Sandkings- The Sandkings are much more than bees and ants. I think they're smart, like people. I've been testing them. Your mom's gonna be home any minute, and I haven't even started dinner. Dad, Mom's not gonna be too thrilled with this. Now you let me worry about that. In the meantime- - I know. - What? - It's a secret. - Yeah. Good boy. So the city council tentatively approved my design for the windows. Yes! But they wanna see a rendering by Friday. - Great, honey. - Yeah. - Congratulations, Mom. - Thank you. However, it means I'm gonna be really, really busy. No problem. I got things under control around here. - So what'd you do in school today? - Nothin'. That sounds educational. How about you? How's it goin'? I got a lot done. I'm keepin' a handle on the work. I should be pretty much up to speed when the lab's up and running again. Lucky how it worked out. You'll be around here this week to keep an eye on Josh. It's weird how things happen sometimes. Weird. Real weird. Really, really weird. Weird. I'll be damned. Entry number 17. The Sandkings have displayed- They've displayed an ability to mimic terrestrial formations. Now, while this could indicate some form of intellect at work... it does not necessarily demonstrate the ability to reason. So I've decided on a change. - Mr. Kress? - Yeah. - Sign here, please. - All the pieces have been precut, right? Yeah. All you gotta do is slap 'em together. It's gonna be some fish tank, huh? I like my seafood fresh. Well, for what you're payin', I certainly hope you're raising caviar. All right, boys and girls. Welcome to the promised land. They're both great, but this amber's perfect. Will you order me some? Sure. Must be nice having Simon home. - Yeah. - You don't seem too happy about it. Take it from me, whether he's at home or at work these days... he's in another world. - Well, that's weird. - What? The computer won't accept your card. - Why? - It says it's over the limit. - No way. It's a screwup. - No, I ran it through twice. I'm supposed to cut it up. Do you wanna call the card company or something? Yeah, I do. - Get out of my way! - Wait- - I wanna know what the hell's goin' on. - Let me explain first! Explain, Simon. Explain to me... why there are over $25,000 worth of purchases on our credit cards! - I got it worked out. - Purchases I knew nothing about! Then when you're done explaining that, try to tell me... how you're gonna pay for them when we can barely pay for our house! Believe me, I wouldn't have done what I did without a reason. No! Listen to me. Give me your hand! Now, now! Give me your hand! Get out of there! Take my hand! Come on! - Give me your hand! - Oh, my God! You're okay! You're clean. You're all right. You're all right. You're clean. You're all right. We found them in the sand brought back by the Mars Lander. - Found what? - Eggs, no bigger than a pinhead. They've been lying dormant for millions of years... till I found the right combination to initiate gestation. So you've been lying to me? Is that what you've been doing up at Mount Parnell... and not analyzing soil samples? It was a classified project! The highest clearance! We couldn't talk to anyone from the outside about it. It wasn't my choice. - So what are they doing in my barn? - They killed the project! They killed the project? Why? I wasn't given a reason. Just told to shut down. Maybe they thought the public would never be ready. I don't know. But on the day I was to leave... I took a sample of the soil. - They're not gonna take that away from me. - They can't stay here. They're dangerous. No, they're not. The Sandkings are intelligent. If they keep evolving, there's no limit to what we can learn from them. - Josh has been recording them- - You gotJosh mixed up in this? - It's perfectly safe. - How can it be safe? The government's trying to destroy these sand things. - They don't understand. - Neither do I! It's a chance to make my mark. I can announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life. Then announce it now. First, I'm taking them to the point of true measured intelligence. Have faith in me, Cath. I want you there with me. - Time for bed. - Just a few more seconds, Mom. Not tonight, bud. There we go. Give him some room there. There we go. Why are you mad at Dad? - Why do you say that? - I heard rumors. Well, everything's okay, I promise. But those sand things worry me. - Sandkings, Mom. - Excuse me. You know how afraid I am of bugs. Remember that time we were drivin'... and there was this huge spider on the dashboard? It was a daddy longlegs. It may have been a daddy longlegs, but it nearly made me drive off the road. But I like helping Dad. He said we might win the "Noble" Prize. Nobel. Bet you do. Anyway, you promise to be careful? Okay. Night, Mom. Good night, baby. What a mess. This is entry 24- This is entry 24. Entry- This is entry 24 of the eighth day- This is entry 24 of the eighth day of the project, the ninth. The Sandkings have divisioned- This is entry 24 on the eighth day of the project. The 19th generation of Sandkings... have differentiated into two distinct species- one red in coloration, the other white. Also, I've- I've begun to distinguish certain individuals among the two species. They seem to have taken to their new habitat quite nicely... and it's my hope that the increase in size of the habitat... will stimulate the production of eggs by the two queens. Now, I can verify that theory by the following data. Just give me a moment. I'll be right with you. Charlton Heston, eat your heart out. Listen. I've done it. I've done it. Ah, the Nobel Prize. Words cannot describe my appreciation. What an honor, to stand before you illustrious people. - I'd like to thank my wonderful family- - Josh, let's go, bud. - Breakfast is on the table. I gotta run. - Cathy! - I'm late, Simon. - Listen to me. I've done it! - Done what? - What I was talking about yesterday. Cowboy's gone. He wasn't in my room when I woke up. Are you kidding? Did you look under the bed and everywhere? - I looked all over. - He's out chasing squirrels or something. - Cathy. Listen to me. - Give it a break! There's a crisis. Come on. We'll go outside. We'll look around the neighborhood. Listen. Listen. Cathy! Cathy! Okay, go look for the damn dog! I don't believe it. - Cowboy! - Come on, Cowboy! - You in there? - Cowboy! You didn't get your breakfast! - I have to go. I got my presentation. - Okay. Maybe your dad'll help you before you go to school. - See you later. - Cowboy! Cowboy! Dave Stockley, please. Simon Kress. I'll hold. Cowboy! Cowboy! Simon. Dave Stockley. Simon? Cowboy! Cowboy! Nothing goes in, nothing goes out. You got that? Are you hungry again? Too bad. From now on, it's survival of the fittest. You only get what I give you. No more "manna from heaven." Forget it. The committee took another design. I didn't get the job. Did you hear me? I heard you. We'll just- Just have to take out a loan, that's all. Take out a loan? I don't think there's a bank on the planet that's going to give us another loan. You know, I would really love to know what goes through your mind. I tell you that a project I've been working on for six months... just got rejected, and- "Take out a loan." You don't even say, "I'm sorry." I'm sorry. Oh, great. - You ready, Mom? - Sure, honey. - Where are you going? - To look for the dog. You remember Cowboy, don't you? My God. Entry 31. Structure is approximately 90 centimeters in height. 120 centimeters in width. Fabricated after the initial damage to the Sandking castle. Estimated time for construction, 12 hours. Purpose of the structure is- Unknown. If you think my face is gonna get you food... you got another think comin'. And you red guys, you better get with the program. Now, don't go gettin' a big head. Oh, shit! Ouch! You bastard! Shit. You fucking bastard. Shit. Shit! Preliminary analysis of Sandking venom reveals... presence of microorganisms. Now... it's unknown... what the effect of those- those microorganisms is... within the human bloodstream. As a result, a possibility of infection... is almost impossible to engage. I mean, to gauge. Only time will tell. As far as the new constructions are concerned... I can only speculate as to their purpose. Either they're an extension of the Sandkings'ability to- to build specific forms, or maybe they're a form of worship. Maybe they- are an attempt at some sort of appeasement. And whether this is- is an indication of- of intelligence... I don't know. - Oh, my God! - You can still call me Simon. - Simon, what are you doing? - Simon Says- - Simon says? - Let's play. Simon says, look behind you. Now, open the curtain. Do it. I didn't say, "Simon Says." How long has this been going on? All week now. He's completely shut himself into the barn. He won't let anyone in, not even Josh, and- It's like we don't even exist when he comes out. We barely see him anymore. I don't know. I don't even know who I'm livin' with anymore. - What's he working on now? - I can't tell you. - Well, why? - I just- I can't. What is it you want me to do, Cathy? Well... I thought maybe you could talk to him. I'm not very good at that. You ought to know- we hardly agree on anything. - Why me? - You're his father. And I think that deep down, that- I think Simon's doing this for you. You know, it's- He wants to accomplish something. He wants you to be proud ofhim. He wants you to feel about him... the way you do about his brother. Ah, that's ridiculous. It's the truth! I think that all his life... Simon's been trying to get your approval. I'm sorry. I don't mean to yell at you. It's just- Really, you can see that, can't you? Oh, I don't know about that. And I don't know what my talking to him is going to accomplish either. Oh, incredible! Devastation. Organisms have been denied food for 36 hours. The first conflict erupted 40 minutes ago. Five white mobiles attacked a red. It was dismembered and fed to the white queen. Red retaliation occurred almost instantly. War has been constant. Battle maneuvers are getting extremely sophisticated. I estimate total losses on both sides at 20%. Only the strongest and smartest survive. I feel as if the organisms could leave the habitat... whenever they desired, and yet they stay... as if to perform for me, or to- to communicate with me. I know and feel that... as soon as regular feedings resume, that there will evolve... a deepening trust between us. Entry 51. The presence of infection confirmed. I will attempt to... retard the spread of the microorganisms... with use of conventional antibiotics. But their effects are- are greatly in doubt. The experiment has taken on a life of its own. And it will continue... regardless of what happens to me. Dave. I'm sorry I missed you. You said if I ever needed anything, I should call? However, I think you need me, old buddy. We need each other. We're at a threshold. I can't do this alone. Please come see my surprise tomorrow morning, Dave. Come alone. Good God. - What do you want? - You look like hell. Is that why you came here? To tell me I look like hell? - Came here to talk to you. - Talk. Not like this. Not through this damn door. Can't I come in? What is it? - Your wife is very worried about you. - What'd she tell you? That you were working on a secret project... - and it was drivin' you crazy. - Just workin' a little harder than usual. You don't talk to her anymore. Or toJosh. And she sent you to come here and lecture me about my relationship with my son. Who's crazier, me or her? I had a good relationship with your brother. Yes. What was it, huh? What happened between us? You're not doing this because- I don't know, because you- you feel you need to- to prove yourself to me or anything like that, are you? You think I'm doing this for you? You poor old bastard. You think the world revolves around you. You're sick. David would never have talked to me that way. No, because he was your little puppet, your little soldier. He'd do anything you wanted him to. Marched off to war for you. Even got himself killed for you. Get out of here. Where were you? - I had an interview for a job. - Bullshit! - What are you talking about? - What am I talking about? He came here. - My father came here. - Well, he's worried about you. He was spying on me for you! I thought I could trust you. Trust? You're talking about trust? You're the one who's been lying to your wife! - You're calling yourself my wife? - Simon, stop it! - You betrayed me. Betrayed our family! - Stop it, Simon. - Simon, you need some help. - All I need is to get you out of my life! All right! All right. - Come on, Josh. We gotta go. - I'm almost done! Well, just take what you need. I'm gonna start packing the car. - Come on! - Okay. - Aren't we gonna say bye to Dad? - No. No, we're gonna call Daddy from Grandpa's house. Get in the car. Get in the car, Josh. Now. Okay, seat belt on? Entry 57. Kathy and Josh are gone. Gone over to the enemy. Just me now. Just me. War has been constant. Battle maneuvers... have gotten extremely sophisticated. I estimate total losses on both sides at 20%. Only the strongest and smartest survive. I feel as if the- the organisms could... leave the habitat whenever they desired and yet they stay... as if to perform for me, or to- to- This is quite the hobby you've got going here, Simon. Dave! Got your own little slice of Mars. Sort of brings new meaning to the phrase "mad scientist." I expected you tomorrow morning. Yeah, I got your message, and I decided to come a little early. You know I like things to add up. Now they do. These castles, do they serve a purpose? They're used for defense. In war. - They war? - Oh, intricate battles. With the proper motivation, of course. Scarcity of food. - How many generations? - Thirty-three. Did you- - Did you see the carvings? - Yes. - Why you? - I'm their source of life. - God. - Oh, it's all right here, Dave. What mankind has dreamt about for decades. The proof of alien intelligence. Well, I have to admit, Simon... what you have created is truly... unfathomable, really. It's a shame it's gonna have to all disappear. - It is? - What's happened to you? Have you seen what you look like in the mirror? I don't know what's gonna be harder to clean up, Simon. You or this... mess. Simon, with your brilliance, I mean, your genius... how could you create something so dangerous? Listen, I'll do what I can. I promise you. I'll do what I can for you. To try and keep you out of jail. Okay? Thanks, Dave. - Oh, my God. Oh, God. - You talking to me, Dave? Simon! I won't say anything. I won't say anything, Simon! You're wrong, Dave. - You're gonna scream. - Help! No! - Ugh. - No! No! Thanks. I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have left him. You had to. You did the right thing. At least for now. I guess. He's a good kid, isn't he? The best. Ahh, the Nobel Prize. My feelings are... indescribable. I'm so honored to be- be in this company, to be with you. It's the greatest moment of my life. I am humbled... by the presence in this room. And of course, the- the ghosts of the great scientists of the past. Darwin. Einstein. Oh, my God, they're all- They humble me. But it's very lonely. Very lonely. No one... really knows who- who I am. Do you? No. There is. There is someone... who could tell you who I am. My brother. But- He's- He's not here, and- My father. He- He deserves my gratitude. He helped me. Helped me. My dear father. But he doesn't like my hair, do you? No. Well. We'll fix that. I have a surprise for you. Where, where are you? Where are you? There you are. Do you like this better, Father? Perhaps not. For you, dear Father. Good-bye, hair. Thanks. - Simon Kress? - Yes, sir. Sorry to disturb you, but I'm checking up on a Mr. David Stockley. He didn't come home last night, and his wife said he was coming here. I was expecting him. He never showed up. - About what time were you expecting him? - Around 7:00. Do you have any idea where Mr. Stockley might be? No, sir. I'm sorry. I don't. You used to work with Mr. Stockley, am I right? Yes, sir. Dave- Dave and I have known each other for years. I hope he's okay. He seemed okay, last time I saw him. He's been under a little stress at work, but nothing unusual. You're welcome to look around, if you want. No, I don't think that'll be necessary. I'm sure he'll turn up somewhere. Probably with a hangover. - Let me know if I can help out, sir. - Have a nice day. - Yes, sir. - Unit seven, please respond. It's an emergency, possible 411. Roger. I'm on my way. Time for God to make a Second Coming. No! Where are you? Where are you? How ya doin', champ? You know, there's some things in life that... you just don't have any control over. And you know what? Cowboy might still turn up. So hang in there, okay? - Okay, Grandpa. - Attaboy. Look at that, huh? There we go. This looks nice and comfy. Up you go. You okay? I really miss Dad. Me too. But you're here. Have a good sleep. Night-night, honey. Josh. Josh? Dad? - What are you doing here? - Dad? Stay close. They won't harm me. - Get back. Stand back! - Dad! - Stay back there. - Dad! Come on! Please! Dad! Stay back. Stay back! I told you. The laundry chute. Go on! Get back. Get back! What have I done? Come on. Over there. Josh! Come on. Get up there. - Josh, where are you? - Mom! Over here! - Go on! Get up there! - Not without you! - Get up there! I mean it. Come on! - Mom! Josh! Mom, they're all after Dad, and he won't come out! Simon? Simon! I'm sorry. - Simon? Get in the car, both of you. - No. Now! Simon, take my hand. - Simon! - No. Come on, now. Get out of there! I have to do this. Simon! Simon! - No, go! - I can't do that! You're my son. Dad, please. Go! Simon. No! Dad, please. Go. Where's Simon? Get ready for Armageddon. Dad! This way! Keep movin'. Increasingly, modern science... pursues powers traditionally reserved for the Almighty. But those who encroach upon the province of the gods... realize, too late, that the price for entrance... is destruction.
