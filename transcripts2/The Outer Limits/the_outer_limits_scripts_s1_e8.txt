 Excuse me. Could you point me to the foreman? You're lookin' at him. Name's Ben Kohler. I was wonderin' if you have any work. Doin' what, entertaining the troops? Doubt you'd pay me to do that. I've done just about every kind of job there is. I operated a crane in Dallas. I was a welder in L.A. Bricklayer in Paris. - As in France? - Texas. - What about it? You got a job? - Sorry. We got nothin'. I got a list of about 40 guys ahead of you. There's not much construction goin' on in Seattle right now.

 I'll take those keys, man! Give me the keys! - Here you go. Take it. - Give me your wallet. - Come on! - Okay. Guitar. It's worthless to you. I've had it since I was- Gunshot wound to the head. He's losing blood fast. Get Respiratory down here. Start a second line. D5W. Clean him up. - I need to see that entry point. - Temporal lobe. - Anybody got an exit? - No. The bullet's still in there. Let's get a head X-ray, blood gases and EEG Stat. Out of the way, please. Okay, folks, he's all yours. I need that second line now. I would like to implant the new-generation cerebral chip. He's the first ideal subject we've had.

 He's 35, healthy. Good vitals. But, Doctor, the new-generation chips aren't tested in humans. We don't know its side effects. The previous generation of the chip killed everyone we tried it in. It didn't kill everyone. I'm confident we've remedied the rejection problem. - And what if you haven't? - I can't prove it works... unless I test it on a human subject. - What are his chances? - Good. Fifteen lab chimps have had the new implant for two years with no mortality. We're running out of time. - Will you authorize? - All right. She's throwing too many PVC's. Drop a hundred milligrams of lidocaine. IV's almost through. Let's hang up another bag. Starting climate equalization. Saw. Get... out of my head! There is nothing wrong with your television. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are now controlling the transmission. We control the horizontal... and the vertical. We can deluge you with a thousand channels... or expand one single image to crystal clarity... and beyond. We can shape your vision... to anything our imagination can conceive. For the next hour... we will control all that you see and hear. You are about to experience the awe and mystery... which reaches from the deepest inner mind to... The Outer Limits. It is a common scientific belief... that humans use but a small fraction of the brain. Researchers all over the world try to unlock the secrets... hidden in these darkened parts of the mind. But do we really want to unlock such secrets? And how will we deal with the dark discoveries that lie within? - How are we doin'? - BP 110 over 75. Pulse 80. All right. The first test is gonna be to disconnect bypass. So we see if the chip regulates his breathing and heartbeat? That's right. Go ahead. - Irregular heartbeat. - Come on. Come on, cut in. Six milligrams Atnodine. Normal sinus rhythm. BP is holding. He's breathing on his own. Nice work, Doctor. Let's close. - Any change? - No. - What do you think? - He's only been out eight hours... but his heart and lung functions are perfect... even more regular than a human brain could keep them. My only concern is that his lateral sulcus was damaged. - He won't be able to speak. - I hope he will. I hooked up the oral channels in the cerebral chip... but we've never been able to test that function. I hope we've made the right decision for this man. Sir. I spent eight years in the research wing perfecting the cerebral chip. - It'll work. - It better, Doctor. For your sake and for the hospital's. I'll see you at the press conference. 3:00. Sir? Sir? Can you see me? Am I dead? You're very much alive. - What's your name? - Ben Kohler. Call Dr. Lambert. Tell him the good news. Mr. Kohler can talk. Boy, does my head hurt. Get out of my head. Leave me alone. Please. Get out! So, Doc, be straight with me. - How long do I have? - Mr. Kohler... if you do exactly as I say- take good care of yourself- there's no reason why you can't live a long and relatively normal life. I won't lie to you. This procedure is very experimental. That makes the results... unpredictable. Very experimental? How many other people have this thing in their head? We tested the old CCI on several people... but, actually, you're the first to get this version of the chip. - The first? - It's okay, Mr. Kohler. The CCI has been thoroughly tested. It's safe. What happened to the people who had the old version? They all died, didn't they? We had mixed results. But I want you to understand- Who gave you permission to use me as a guinea pig! Who were we going to ask, Mr. Kohler? We didn't know who you were. There was no wallet, no next of kin. You were unconscious. You would have died. You should consider yourself very, very lucky... that you were near this particular hospital, near me. - You would be dead by now. - I feel very lucky. Leave me alone! Get out of my head! Get out of my head.! God.! Leave me alone. I operate alone. I operate alone. I operate alone! Jennifer, there are two reporters in the lobby... who want to talk to you and Mr. Kohler. - I told you- no interviews. - Tell them yourself. For three weeks, I have been acting like your press agent. I have better things to do. You're right. Call Dr. Lambert and tell him to have Security handle it from now on. - Thank you. - Okay. Sally, have you seen Mr. Kohler? Yeah. He's in the children's ward. Dr. Martinez. Say hi, everybody. - Hi, Dr. Martinez. - Hello. Dr. Martinez is gonna sing "Hickory Dickory Dock" with us, aren't you? - No. I don't sing. - Sure you do. - Don't we all wanna hear her sing? - Yeah! It's really nice of the staff to give me this guitar. Well, it was well appreciated by all... especially the children in the pediatric ward. After a month in here, I would've gone nuts without it, so thank you. Mr. Kohler, I can't emphasize this enough. You have a miracle in your head. Don't take it for granted. What do you think I'm gonna do, bang my head against the wall? I don't like the sound of this apartment of yours. - Is it clean, dry, warm? - I'll be fine. - You have the instructions I gave you? - Yes. You have my beeper number. - Call me anytime- day or night- - Dr. M. We're gonna need you. Auto accident. Teenage girl has a piece of the guardrail lodged in her abdominal cavity. You're the only surgeon available. Mr. Kohler, can you wait for me? Mr. Kohler. Don't worry about it. It wasn't your chip that made me pass out. I just want to be sure. Doc, that girl that came in was covered in blood. I don't much like the sight of blood, if you know what I mean. - Have you ever passed out before? - Well- Yeah. Mr. Kohler, don't be embarrassed. Seventy-five percent of the men that walk in here... are squeamish at the sight of blood. Half pass out. Well, then I'd better get out of here before another bloody body rolls in. Thank you for saving my life. If there's anything I can do- You can take care of yourself. Stop! Stop! What are you lookin' at? Huh? Get out of my head! I don't know what to tell you. We've done a CAT scan and an EEG. The readout from the chip is normal. My only guess would be that the hallucinations are caused... by the antirejection drugs we gave you. Look, it was more than a hallucination. Much more. I was having feelings- of excitement, fear, anger- that I didn't understand. It was like I had someone else's emotions. I had memories, but they weren't my own. It was like I had somebody else's brain for that moment. Or my brain was in someone else's head. Look, I'm sure you felt all those things. But I built the CCl2 myself, and, I am telling you... what you're describing could not be caused by my chip. Or at least you won't admit it was caused by your chip. God forbid your ticket to the top should have a flaw. I resent that. My first responsibility is to you, the patient. Then figure out what's wrong with your chip and call me. Hey, beautiful. Looks like we have someone with us- someone who likes to look where he has no business looking. Why don't you say hello? Nice you could join us. Mr. Kohler! Mr. Kohler! Ben. You're here in the hospital. What happened? What- Somebody in Homicide, please. Homicide. Lieutenant Wilson speaking. Yes. - This is gonna sound crazy. - Nothing sounds crazy to me anymore, pal. Let me guess- you know who shotJohn F. Kennedy. Have there been any women murdered in the woods? There are a lot of woods around this city, sir. What woods would you be talking about? I don't know. I wasn't actually there. - We need a trace on three. - That's why this sounds so crazy. I saw it happen. I mean, not in person. I think I saw it through the killer's eyes. Never mind. It was a hallucination. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Just a minute. Don't hang up. What's your name? - I'd rather not say. - Okay, fine. Listen, we did have a homicide in the woods out by Cave Springs. - When, this morning? - We found the body this afternoon. - Sir, are you still there? - Yes. Listen, we kept this out of the press. How exactly did you see it? Let's just say I saw it telepathically. Telepathically. Well, you know, sir, someone with your telepathic ability... would be a great asset to the police department. Why don't you come on down, have a talk with us? We'd like to meet you. Sir, are you there? Did we get it? We didn't get it. - Come here. - Hey, hey. Ben. Ben. Come here. I gotta talk to you. - We can't- - Just come here. A killing like the one I saw really happened. So you think what you saw was real and not a hallucination? How else do you explain it? - How about a coincidence? - I'm not gonna debate this with you. I know it was real. Then why don't you go to the police? They'd throw me in jail before I finished telling the story. - Why would they do that? - Just think about it. A guy shows up, knows all the gruesome details of a murder... but says he wasn't there- says he saw it because of some chip in his head. - They're not gonna buy that. - I'll go with you. - I'll tell them about the chip. - No police. You have a problem with the police? Not any more than anybody else. If I'm gonna help you, you're gonna have to trust me. Well, I do trust you. - Then tell me about you and the police. - There's nothing to tell. - Fine. Do you want me to call them, or- - All right. I did time when I was 19. For what? Manslaughter. Don't get all freaked out. - It's not what it sounds like. - What happened? I was in a bar. This guy about three times my size started forcing himself on this girl- putting his hands where they didn't belong- so I intervened... with a pool cue right over his head. I didn't mean to kill him though. Anyway, cops busted me, railroaded me through the system. I spent three years in jail for saving a girl from getting raped. I'm sorry. All right. No police. But I'm going to have to check you back into the hospital. Come on. A month in here was enough. How can I figure out what's going on in your head if I can't observe you? Can't you observe me somewhere else? Come on in. So, this is it. - You should be comfortable here. - Nice place. I see brain surgery's treated you very well. The kitchen and the bathroom are in there. You can sleep on the couch. Why are you taking me into your home? Because you wouldn't stay in the hospital. That's kind of above and beyond the call of duty, isn't it? If I'm gonna figure out what's going on with the chip... I need you around me for constant observation. You're willing to take this huge risk just for this thing that's in my head? - Risk? - I do have a record. How do you know I didn't kill those women? - The thought crossed my mind. - But you didn't call the cops. I like to think of myself as a pretty good judge of character. Besides, I don't think that a man who faints at the sight of blood... would make it a habit of stabbing women to death. - You know what I think? - What? I think you don't wanna risk the cops putting me in jail. 'Cause if they put me in that little 3-by-5-foot room- with God knows who else- they put your precious chip in there too. Then you can't keep tabs on it. You don't let up, do you? You don't trust anybody, not even someone who's trying to help you. Come on. You're not trying to help me. All you're interested in is making yourself famous. You gotta look out for number one. I learned that that night in the bar. You start caring about somebody- you can't step on 'em on your way up the ladder. - You don't believe that. - Everybody does, including you. You just won't let it be a conscious thought. You can help yourself to anything in the fridge. There's only one bathroom so... do knock before you come in. Benny boy, you're just in time. You like my lady? She only cost a hundred bucks. How do you know my name? Can you hear me? I get in your head too, Benny. I mean, so farjust during thejuicy stuff. But I'm hopin' for more. Much more. Who you talkin' to? Come and get me, Benny boy! He knows my name. Make it stop. This is a mistake. We have never attempted to adjust a CCl2 after implantation. - There's no telling what it can do. - I don't care. If it's gonna stop these visions, I wanna try it. I can't handle it anymore. If this guy is real, like you say... don't you feel an obligation to stop him, save his victims? What do you want me to do? Last time I tried to help somebody... I got thrown in jail for three years. Every time I have a vision, I see his memories. I see horrible things. I feel the pleasure he gets in killing his victims. I feel psychotic. With every vision, I'm getting a little bit more like him, and that's gotta stop. 'Cause I don't wanna kill anybody. You understand me? We usually keep the chip running at 35 microamps. If we lower the current, it may or may not "induce" the visions... but it may also not communicate with your body anymore. Which means it can shut down your lungs, your heart... your eyes or any combination thereof. Will you just do it! Check that one level one more time for me. - I've got it at 34 microns. - Okay. This interface can transmit adjustments to the chip. What I am attempting to do is to reduce the C current slightly. Are you sure you wanna do this? You got me into this. You get me out. Thirty-four microamps. Thirty-three. Thirty-two. Damn it! He's phasing. Okay, move it over here. 200! Clear! Again! 250! Clear! Charging. Damn. All right. He's at level 16 again. It's 33. He's now stabilizing. Why can't we try the adjustment again? Because... your heart may not survive another fibrillation. I want you alive. You worried about me or just your chip? Both. What are you doin' all alone? I'm not alone. I have friends. My parents are still alive. I have a sister. You know what I mean. Why isn't there a man in your life? I don't think that's any of your business. You shouldn't have any problems attracting one. - You're beautiful. You're smart. - I need to take another reading. Some guy break your heart, Doc? Is that why you're so cold? Would you just hold still for one minute? After you answer the question. Who was he, some doctor? He was a cardiologist, and we were supposed to be married lastJuly. - What happened? - I caught him in the morgue... on the autopsy table- with a blonde pathologist. And you wonder why I don't trust anybody. Okay. Now, will you just hold still a minute? How's that thing work? Shouldn't you have to stick a needle in my head or something? Not that I want you to do that. The cerebral chip and the monitor communicate at a very low RF. - RF? - Radio frequency. Hey, wait a minute. - That might explain what's going on. - What? The CCI actually broadcasts and receives signals... to and from the monitoring device. - So? - If the killer had a chip in his head... you might be receiving signals from it. That would explain it. How many other people have this chip? Four have the old version, but- There's something I don't understand. Why would you only receive signals every now and then... and why not all the time? I only seem to get it when there's a killing. Maybe... it's when the killer gets pumped or scared or excited or something. Adrenaline. Adrenaline must be hyperstimulating the CCI. Does that mean you can stop the visions? - Only if the killer's heavily sedated. - Let's find out who it is. We tested the old chip on several volunteers about three years ago. They all had terminal brain tumors. Unfortunately, all but these four rejected the chip and died. - I still monitor them on a weekly basis. - I think we can rule them out. It's a man. It's not him. I can see the killer's hands in the visions. They're white. Unfortunately, only those four are still alive. Wait. Go back. I operate alone! His name is Wayne Haas, but he died in a fire about a year ago. He was an accountant, and his office burned down. Where did he live? Do you know? It was an awful place. I think it was condemned. You gotta take me there. Dear God! Dear God! Dear God! Her head's cut open. Oh, my God! We gotta call the police. It's okay. It's okay. It's gonna be all right. - It's never been this bad! What's wrong? - I don't know. Feels like my head's gonna explode! Ben, what is it? What are you seeing? Tell me. Outside a house. Looks familiar. - What? - He's here! This is great, Benny. I saw you coming through your eyes. Why are you fighting me, Doctor? He's hurt. Let me help him. Poor Benny. He's gonna be okay. I called the cops. They're on their way. They're gonna take care of him. Get up! Get in the driver's seat, sweetheart. I thought you were dead. That's because that's what I wanted you to think. But they found the body. That poor man shouldn't have been in my office when it caught on fire. Get us outta here! Police! Stay put! Don't move. You're under arrest. Okay, I'm trying to understand. You admit you were the one who called us the other day. - Yes, but- - And you know all the bloody details... of these murders because you saw them with some kind of ESP. No, not ESP. I have a computer chip in my brain. A computer chip in the brain. So you receive signals from aliens telling you to kill. - Is that it? - Will you just listen to what I'm saying! He's gotJennifer, doing God knows what with her... and you're sittin' around asking me a bunch of stupid questions. You listen to me. I don't care if you killed those women... because you got a computer chip in your brain or because Satan told you to... or because aliens told you to- I don't care why. I care where, when, who and how many. - How many women did you kill? - None. It was a guy named Wayne Haas. - Wayne Haas is dead. We checked. - No, he's not. - How do you know? - Because he has a chip in his brain too. I can see things through his eyes. Of course. Why didn't I realize that? Will you please just send someone out to find Haas and Dr. Jennifer Martinez? Answer my question, and I'll look into what you're talking about. Deal? Go ahead. Was the woman you killed around the beginning of December the first one? - Is that when they started? - You tell me. When where the others? The ones we know about were December 2... December 10, December 22. You think something's funny about that? I was listed in critical condition from December 1 to December 3. I spent about a month after that in the hospital- St. Vincent's Hospital. You can call and check it out. My doctor was Dr. Martinez. Look, check it out. Hurry. There you go. There. Gosh. This is a very special moment in our relationship. - Why are you doing this? - Why? My brain hurts an awful lot. I need a new one. I figured you must take awful good care of yours. Mr. Haas. You can't transplant a brain- mine or anyone else's. It wouldn't survive outside the body. Shut up! Shut up! Run a check on her, okay? Hey, Benny. - Benny, are you still with me? - What? Hey, Benny boy. Do you think- Do you think her brain will fit inside of my head? Come on. Come on, where are you? You're never gonna know where I am, Benny. I've been too careful. You know, I've been lookin' all over for a good, clean brain. I gotta tell ya. They're very hard to come by. Dr. M. Here is my last chance of gettin' a good one. And once you're rottin' away in jail, I'm gonna have to stop lookin'. Hey. What do you think of this room? Mirrors everywhere. You can observe the transplant. Huh? You can watch me open up her head. - Yeah. In the mirror. - You leave her alone! Sure. Okay, Ben. Guess we owe you an apology. Hospital confirmed your alibi. Also confirmed... you got some kind of hardware in your head. Hey. You okay? Hey. Hey. There it is. That's the sign I saw. Roberts, you head around the east side. - I've got the west side of the building. - Where? Are you okay? You took an awful lot of those tranquilizers. It's the only way he can't see me. No adrenaline, no transmission- Hey, Benny.! You trying somethin'here? Are you seeing something? What's wrong? Thirty-two microamps. What's that mean? Huh? - You have to let me go in there alone. - No way. I can't. - You have to. - It's too dangerous. Listen, Lieutenant. She saved my life. You gotta give me a chance to repay that favor. Besides, I'm the only person who can see what he sees. I can sneak in in a way that he's not looking. I'm sorry. There's no way. I'd lose my job. I'm gonna call in a negotiator and a SWAT team. You wait here. Hey, guys. Now listen. We don't know what's goin' on down here. We're gonna have to be careful. We don't wanna panic this guy. We don't want him to know we're out here. I'm just doin' what you always told me to do, Doctor- take care of myself. My brain hurts. It hurts. Ben, don't do it. You'll both arrest. Get the door! Come on! Cover the back! - Untie me! Untie me! - Get the paramedics in here now! Come on. Somebody take care of this guy. Come on, Ben! 200! Clear! - Again! - Charging! 200! 300! Clear! Again! 400! Clear! - Clear! Oh God! - That's it. He's gone. - Why isn't it working? Again! - I've got no signs. Clear! - Nothing, ma'am. - Again! Clear! - There's nothing there, ma'am. - Please, ma'am. Let's go. Come on. Let's get you out of here. Come on. You did the best you could. If you were offered the chance... to communicate with another person's mind... would you choose to do it, knowing that, in return... you would have to expose your own deepest... and most intimate thoughts?
