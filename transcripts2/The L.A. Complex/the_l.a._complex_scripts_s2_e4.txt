 Previously on The L.A. Complex... I was worried there was gonna be some steep competition for this job. I can't afford both of you, so whoever's not funny enough, I'll just fire. You're a dead man, Wagner. I booked "Saving Grace!" Please watch over us as we try to make our humble show in your name. You went out all night with God knows who! We moved too fast because I needed a place to live.

 That sounds like breaking up. Does that mean we're staying? For now. Be my girlfriend. I'm Jen, by the way. I wanna hire you to be my boyfriend. You really think that I should do this? It's an opportunity. I'm pregnant. Oh! Ah! Are you okay? Next caller. We've got Walter. Are you there? Hello, Kaldrick, do you believe in second chances?

 I'm looking for Walter Dugan. - And you are? - I'm his son. Dad! Let me in! Be a man, son! You've gotta learn to stand up for yourself. Come on, dad, please! Kaldrick. Sean! It's been a long time. At least have some breakfast before you go. 2x04 - Be a Man - ♪ In the summertime ♪ ♪ I don't know if the stars were aligned ♪ ♪ Stumbled onto something we would like ♪ ♪ And I'm afraid I lost the words tonight... ♪ "Falling star Jennifer Bell grabs rocketing boy-toy" You all right? So how you feeling about your first day on set with what's it called? Raccouger? Cactibear two. Ah yes, the classic showdown of man against half-bear, half-cactus. Who wins? Certainly not the viewers. The script's a mess, but I'm number one on the callsheet, and the director's that Lance Randoon guy. I'm sorry, Lance Randoon? Yeah, it's a ridiculous name, I know, but he's had like three movies at Sundance, so he's someone I wanna get in with. That's great! Yeah. We can bond over our mutual slumming. Wow. Sounds like you have it all figured out. Mm-hmm. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing. I'm fine. How 'bout you? Are you excited for your big fancy premiere party tonight? What should I wear? I can't go. Of course I can't go, you have to take your new girlfriend. I wish that I could take you. You know that, right? Yeah, I know. You were the one who said that this was a good idea. Yeah, I know. I'm fine. There'll be other premieres. I owe you an apology, Mary, a best friend shouldn't be so competitive. I guess when life hands us lemons, we all don't have to make lemonade. Sometimes someone can make lemonade, and another person can make lemon meringue pie, or lemon chicken piccata. It doesn't matter, the point is, that there's enough lemons for everyone. Hey. Have you read next week's episode? It is shockingly pro-life. Mm. Mm-hmm. I bomb a free clinic. That's cool. Are you not listening or you're just radically right wing, and didn't tell me, or? Sorry, it's been a rough morning. Why do you smell like chlorine? I broke up with my boyfriend last night. Aw, that sucks. Congratulations. What? I thought you told me to apologize. And did you? - Well, I tried. - So, you tried. If that's not enough for this guy, forget him. Look, you're a catch, lady. Someone's gonna snatch you up. Okay, wait. So if you broke up with your boyfriend last night, where did you sleep? A lounge chair by the pool. Which is why you smell-like chlorine. Like chlorine! I knew we'd get there eventually. And cut, moving on. Abby and Brandon, you're up next. You hear that? We're up next. Right? I can only imagine the experience would be much worse drunk on absinthe, or whatever that was. Nick! Wow! You're here bright and early. Well, you're early. How was your night? I finished the desk pieces you wanted. Oh yeah, right. I gave you homework! How'd that go? Okay, so, uh, the first one, Paul's behind the desk. Okay, hold on a second. Actually, Sabrina got us thinking at the bar last night... Desk pieces - they're just so played out, so we're gonna go a different way. A different way. What different way? Yeah, we wanna get Paul out from behind the desk as much as possible, you know? Get him on his feet doing visual things, active things! Active. So that's like the opposite of what you had me doing. Yeah. Do you have any ideas for active things? Sorry, my head's been, you know, in the other. Sorry. You know I have to decide which one of you gets the job in like 48 hours, right? No, I know, I just- I see, you're just trying to make this whole decision of who to keep, who to fire, easier on me. That's it, right? Thanks, Nick, you're a good guy. We're playing on the monkey bars. Tyler says that swings are for babies. And you don't remember seeing anyone suspicious? Or a vehicle maybe, something with tinted windows? No, I just looked up and he was gone. Okay! That was perfect. This whole showbiz thing ain't so hard. Look at us, we've got two auditions in one day. Yep. Yep?! Do you even realize how amazing your sister is? Do you know how hard it is to get these auditions without an agent? How come you're not having breakfast? I... ate before you got up. Well, I woke you up. What are you, a detective now? I'm not hungry. Eat your breakfast. Shelter food's fine, but you can't beat Emilio's taquitos. Extra chorizo, just the way you like it. The way I like it? You did when you were a kid. Now don't tell me you've gone all vegetarian on me. Remember when I took you to that Mexican place on Sixth, you had that huge burrito? Yeah, I remember a lot of things. You could probably handle it easily now. Yeah. Some things change, some things don't. Look, I know I've made some mistakes. Mistakes?! Is that what you're calling 'em? No. Mistakes is forgetting a birthday, or maybe a basketball game. You didn't make mistakes, you failed, Walter! I don't want you in my life, so stop contacting me! I'm a man now, and I'm doing just fine on my own. Then why are you here? Don't work too hard, guys. Excuse me. Can I help you? Connor Lake, right? Mike O'Brien. Do I know you? I'm the insurance investigator assigned to your case. I just, uh, wanted to clarify a couple of things you said in your statement. Sorry, case? Your house fire? Right, of course. Sorry, um... Yeah, anything I can do to help. Yeah, I just had a quick um... Yeah, here we go. You said in your statement the fire started when you were making tea. Yeah, that's right. But first responders said they found you on the front lawn with a beer in your hand. You always drink tea and beer at the same time? I must've grabbed it after. After your kitchen caught fire, you grabbed a beer from your fridge? The fridge in your kitchen? Maybe I grabbed it before, I don't know. Listen, I'm late for a fitting, so can I give you my number? Oh, I've got your number. Okay, great. If you have any other questions, just give me a call. Thanks. Okay, let's sign you in. - Who are you? - Uh, I'm new. Wanna watch me play action figures? Sure. Mine's Tyson, what's yours? Simon, but he's not mine, he's my brother. Oh! Okay. Thank God! I was gonna say I hate you - for looking so young, I mean. He's got a great look. - Yeah? - Yeah. You should get your folks to get him to see a stylist. Why? You know, give him a haircut, wardrobe, colour consultation. Whiten his teeth maybe. He's ten. I know it sounds crazy, but when we did it for Tyson it really increased his bookings. Well, thanks, but he's a kid, not a dog in a dog show. I'm probably not gonna neuter him or get his ears clipped either, you know? I'm kinda leaning towards just letting him stay a kid. Uh, Tyson, let's go sit down, honey. Come on, let's run your lines. Okay, so, where am I standing? Here? Sure, that's good. Okay, where's the cliff? Back there, or...? Wherever! Let's just see it? Okay, where's my co-star? Where's the big guy? Can we get Cactibear in? Flying in Cactibear! Oh! Okay, thanks. Uh, is this it? This is my eye-line? What? - Is this my eye-line?! - Yeah, yeah-ish. And you would say...? Is this really necessary for blocking? Severenson, no! Those needles are razor-sharp like barbed wire, and fly faster than bullets! We just need to stay calm. Open our wingsuits and glide on out of here. Severenson, noooo! And cut! Print that, we got it. Oh, okay, we're moving on then. What?! I didn't know we were rolling! I could use another take. I thought that was just a rehearsal. No, the Cactibear franchise isn't big on rehearsals. Moving on! Well, I don't think the Macgreggor kids will call me a slut again. How can I ever thank you, Charlie? Maybe you can buy me an ice cream sometime. You've got a deal. And cut! That's a wrap on 409! Abby and Brandon, you're done for the day. Must be nice. The rest of us are moving on to 412. Man, gotta love a one-scene day. What're you up to now? I dunno, I guess I'll... Go mope in your pool chair? Yeah, and catch up on my leaf-skimming. Oh! Um, I was thinking. Laura and I have separate apartments, but we pretty much live together. My place is just kinda sitting there empty. Why don't you use it 'til you find something? No. No, no, no, no. No, I couldn't, look, I have a place, you need a place. Let's skip the part where you resist, and just get these keys in your hands. - Yeah? - Yeah! Well, they're at Laura's though. Come back with me, and let's make this happen. Oh my God, I owe you then! Come on, maybe you can buy me an ice cream sometime. You've got a deal. Come on, slut. So now, the black keys... They're on the show next week, so pitch me. Come on. Nick, you've been quiet all day, man. Hilarious black keys ideas, go! Hilarious... Uh, didn't they break up? Um, they're on the show next week, so I'm gonna say no. Okay, uh, there's that whole are they brother and sister or are they a couple thing. We could do something where Paul tries to like find out. Nick, the black keys are two dudes. Oh. Were you thinking of the white stripes? Yes, yes, I was. So do you actually have any ideas about the band that's actually gonna be on the show? No! No. Okay, you understand the general concept of this room- Okay, look, man, my girlfriend just broke up with me, I am clearly losing the race to win this job, and I haven't slept in like two days. So no, I don't actually have any hilarious ideas about the black freakin' keys just now. Wow. You know what? Paul's in Vancouver, Nick is clearly heartbroken... Let's just call it, shall we? We're going home? What, are you nuts? It's the middle of the day! We're going drinking! Come on, pitch me bars, people! Bars. Bars. Anybody? I used to do comedy at this place around the corner. They're pretty generous with their pours over there. Generous pours - boom, Nick! Spoken like a true alcoholic. Excellent choice. Come on, guys, let us go and help Nicholas cure his heartbreak with alcohol. This is the best I could fix up, quick notice. Come on, you've gotta eat something. You were right. I was a terrible father. Hell, I was a terrible man. I had a lot of time to think on that while I was in prison. Thing is... Everything I've done, all the misery I caused, I can't undo it no matter how much I wish I could. But what I can control is now - how I live my life from here on out. I don't expect you to forgive me. I just want a chance to show you I can change. I don't know, it's really short. Hey! Hey, there he is, there's my date! So, what do you think? Does this scream "critical unit premiere" to you? It's certainly screaming something. No, no-I like it. No, no, see what happens when you're not here? Okay, something else, and not these shoes either. All right, so what am I wearing? I'm not sure yet. There's the rack, just work left to right. This one has too many clasps. Can you find me something else? Who has time for that? Why don't you try and see if there's anything with velcro? I gotta try this on. Oh. Hi, um... There's only one dressing room and we're racing the clock, so can you help me? Sure, uh... okay. Yeah, of course. Thanks. You know, just because this is business doesn't mean we can't have fun. I'd probably just prefer to keep it professional for now, - if that's okay. - Professional. Sure. Come on. No. That lady is crazy! He's the only kid who's talked to me down here! Fine. Hi. I just wanted to come over and say I'm sorry for earlier. You were trying to be helpful and I was very rude. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to say that your kid was a dog, I was just saying you were treating your kid like a dog. Beth, don't. Could Simon maybe have lunch with you guys? Why don't you both join us. Sure. Thanks. I got a double-junior combo, what'd you get? A regular junior combo. Good call, Nick! I'll get the first round. Uh, better call, Sabrina. Nick, I wanna know everything. Uh, sure. About what? About this girl! Do you have any pictures? Sometimes showing naked pictures of your ex to other dudes really helps ease the pain. Hey! See that kid over there? Anything he orders, make it a triple. Anything for me, make it a virgin. Understood? Welcome. This place is hardcore. Who's your decorator? Uh, Laura, actually. Really? I would not have called that. Yeah, she doesn't really wear it on her sleeve at work, but girl has got some edge to her. So, um, how are those keys coming? The keys? Oh, okay, well, here's the thing, I'm starving, so I thought I'd make us some food first. How do you feel about Italian? Oh no, no, no. You really don't have to- listen, we spoke about this. This thing you do where you pretend to not want the things you want? You're gonna want this meal, okay? I'm the best cook that I know. And you're the most modest person I know, so. My tiramisu... induces orgasms. I guess one little orgasm wouldn't hurt. That's the spirit. Wine, too? We've gotta have some wine if we're gonna make gnocchi. What? Gnocchi? Little Italian dumplings? Oh. I heard something else. Cheers. You like this? Yeah, yeah, it's sexy. Yeah, this is Laura's favourite album. Yeah, mm-hmm, she definitely has great taste. So, um, what do your folks do? My dad's in construction, and my mom's a mom. Oh. Are you gonna finish those fries? Nope. So why can't she take Simon to his auditions? She does sometimes, but, um, sometimes she works as a secretary. Like a temp? Yeah, like a temp. Mm-hmm. So how come you're not in school? I graduated early. I'm a genius. Simon, we should go. We gotta find you a suit for your next audition. Oh, "Tiny Millionaires?" Tyson, too. Yeah. Do you know if there's a thrift store around here or something? A thrift store? Yeah, you know what, I'd save your money. Seriously, they don't care what he wears, as long as he's good. - Yeah? - Yeah, believe me. You could go bankrupt trying to buy a costume for every single audition. Besides, the boys are getting along so well, why don't we get some dessert? Oh no, we don't uh... I'm buying. Oh... Okay. - What do you guys want? - Chocolate fudge sundae! Yeah, chocolate fudge sundae. Okay, four chocolate sundaes, coming up! Does that make me not fun? To wanna actually see my girlfriend? Then I guess I'm not fun then. I guess caring makes me a drag. You know what else isn't fun? Sleeping alone in the bed of your own tears. Wait, what is this? Your vodka soda. What're you having? A vodka soda. You mesh wi' my bevridges? I didn't mesh with anything. You know what I need? Elocution lessons? Ha ha ha ha. Change of venue. Who wants to go to the peelers? Check, please! Sorry, strippers. Kind've a guy thing. Wagner. Sabrina! Sabrina! Sabrina! Sabrina! Sabrina! Sabrina! Hi, Lance? Yeah? Hi, I think you misunderstood me back there. I didn't know we were rolling. I thought it was just blocking 'cause you didn't slate. I steal takes on these things all the time. A lot of the actors we use are better when they don't know we're rolling. I'm not one of them. Of course you're not. I'll let you know next time. Promise. Hey, sorry. Look, I know we're not making "Citizen Kane" here, I'm a big fan of yours. I actually took a big rate cut just to work with you, so I'm just hoping we can find a way to make this suck a little bit less. You know the only reason you're here is 'cause Tiffany and Debbie Gibson said no, right? We have exactly one take with you in the can, you don't like how I do things, I'd be happy to replace you with the girl I nted in the first place. I have two weeks, and no overtime to shoot this nightmare, so I can make enough money to finance the picture I actually wanna do. I don't have time to massage your ego! Get over yourself. And that's when I realized, in combining the modern sport of gymnastics with the ancient art of ka-ra-te, they had created the perfect movie. - That's what made you wanna be an actor? - Mm-hmm. A bad action flick starring an olympic gymnast? Okay, I was five. Cut me some slack. When I was five, I wanted to be a pony. So you settled! What happened to that young, idealistic girl? Where'd she go? Well, you know, I grew up. I realized I'm not a pony, I'm never gonna be a pony, and I just moved on to wanting something else. Like what? If my day gets any worse, I am gonna kill somebody! You have a beautiful home. Thank you. Hey, babe. Uh, Abby broke up with her boyfriend last night, so... Oh no! I'm so sorry, that's awful. Thanks. Um, yeah, I was... He was... Yeah, it's tough. Anyway, so she needed a place to stay, so I um- well, she should stay at your place! That's what I said! Remember when I said that? Yeah, so we came back to get the keys, and then I realized we were hungry, so I made us some food. - What the hell is this? - I'm sorry, I- Did you make gnocchi without me? We did. Tell me there's some left. There is. Oh God, thank God! Abby, come on, sit down. Yum! Mmm! Mmm! It's so good, baby! Yeah. I hope you parked your car in a safe place. Didn't drive. I can get one of the volunteers to drive you home. I'm good. I won't call you anymore. You don't have to worry about that. - Walter, check it out! - What you got there? A B+ is what I got, look! Michael Fisher, a B+ on a math test?! Stop the presses! I studied the flash cards every night like you told me. See? You put in the time, the higher you climb. You should've seen the other kids! They were all like, what? And I was like... Kaldrick King? You're Kaldrick King! 'Sup, little man. Oh my God! What are you doing here? He just dropped by for a visit. ♪ Hollow points rippin' thru a po-lice vest ♪ ♪ faggots cry as they run, 'cause they know they be next ♪ ♪ I'm the king of the 'hood, ho's in line for the wood ♪ ♪ Don't need no- ♪ Uh... all right. If I get my friend's camera, can I get a picture taken with you? For sure. They all have suits. Why did Paula say we didn't need a suit if we did? I don't know. Why don't I go ask? You stay here. Hi. Tyson, Simon wanted to ask if you wanna go over and play. He's not mad? Mad... Why would he be mad? Maybe next time you'll learn to be a little more respectful when an adult tries to give you advice. I want you to give Simon Tyson's jacket for his audition. Why would I do that? Because you screwed us. Well, then that would defeat the purpose, wouldn't it? Simon worked hard on this, he deserves the same chance as the rest of these kids. Sometimes life's not fair. You need to let him borrow that jacket right now. Or what? Or else I'll punch you in the face. - No. You wouldn't. - Yes, I would. Right in front of all these other mothers. And they'll go home and tell their husbands over dinner. And the next time they see you, that's all they'll be able to think about. The time you got punched in the face by that teenager and had to get stitches. - Beth. - Simon Pirelli? - Give him the jacket, now! - Beth? I will press charges. I'll sue! You'll be doing it with a broken jaw, sweetie. - Beth? - What?! Tyson said I could borrow his jacket. Simon Pirelli! Coming! Thanks, Tyson. Look-thanks for the sundaes. Nick! Nick! Nick! You'll do a line with me, huh buddy? Those guys are making me feel like some kind of drug addict! Uh yeah sure, I'll do a line. Thank you. Nicholas, my man! - Oh God, I wish we were in Vegas right now. - Me too! The girls there will actually let you touch them, none of this "keep your hands to yourself" nonsense. Totally. Right dude? I wish they had good brothels in L.A.! Oh dude, I'm sure they do. Have you been? Do you know some? Have I? Oh yeah, all the time! Okay well, let's go man, what's your favourite? My favourite? Uh... It's kinda hard to choose, they're all so good. Okay, let's do this, man. Let's do this! I'm gonna cut those squares loose, and buddy, you pick the place, we'll take this party up to the next level! Yes! Next level, I'm that guy, the next level guy. I'm just gonna... Give me a second, please. Brothels. Good brothels... How do you even look something like this up? Hey, all right! Yeah, somebody call the police, there's been a robbery, 'cause you stole the show, my friend. I mean, 'cause your show starts tonight. That's not my best, do you want something to eat? No thanks, mate. You sure? There's ham hocks! Hi. Hey. What's wrong? Stomach ache. Wow, you look like prince charming all dressed up for the ball. That Jennifer Bell's one lucky cinderella. I just forgot my phone. Yeah I know, I was trying to call you earlier. You look really great. What's wrong? - Rough day. - Well, what happened? Uh, let's just say my ego got a little bruised. - You have to go. - Sorry. Well, you're late. I am late. I better go, I'm sorry. Can you tell me about it when I get back? Mm-hmm. Take me with you! You know that I can't. I know... just take me anyway? I really need you right now. You were the one who told me that this was a good idea. No I know, I know I said it was fine, and that it wouldn't bother me, but it bothers me. Well, I don't know what to do with that! Don't worry about it. Just go, I'm fine. Clearly you're not fine Raquel- what do you want from me?! Do you want me to lie to you, and tell you that I'm happy about all this? I'd really rather that you not lay it on me right before the biggest night of my life! The biggest night of your life that I don't get to go to. Okay. No, you know what, I'm not gonna let you make me feel bad about this. I'm sorry you're having a rough day, and you that you think that you need me- Oh no, forget it, I don't need anything from you! Like you didn't need me to get you a part on my show? Like you don't need me to tell you everything's gonna be fine every five minutes? Oh, because you're such a pillar of strength. This coming from the guy who will find any excuse not to be alone! Did you wanna be with me at all, or did you just need a warm body at night because you were afraid of the dark? If you were any less secure, you'd be in pieces. Huh... I'm really sorry that I put you out. I'll come by and I'll get my stuff in the morning. Okay good, you in? Hey, chuckleheads, wait up. Uh yeah no sorry, this is kinda a guy thing. What, are you getting your prostates checked or something? You wanna tell me what's going on? Not especially, no. Come on, go, go, go, go! Let's go. No, I'm fine, I can walk home by myself. Thanks, guys. Not rape-y at all. Settle down man, I'm fine. Yo, don't tell me to settle down! Just tell me where you at so I come get your awol ass! I'm on my way back, don't worry about me! Naw man, see that's what I do. If I don't worry about you Kal, who will? Hello? Hello? You know it used to be this was the time of night I'd just be headin' out. How many people you share this room with? No more'n two or three, mostly. But I'm okay with it. I've got a comfortable bed, three meals a day. Short walk to work. It's just for now, you know, 'til I get back on my feet. Come stay with me. What, at your house? I got room. You don't have to share with nobody. I mean, just for now. 'Til you get back on your feet. Yeah, okay. Oh wow. Wow, wow, wow! Wow! Oh, what is it, my birthday? Okay, so I'm gonna start with these two, and then I'll let you know which one I'm gonna keep in about an hour or so, do you have Viagra? 'Cause I'm gonna need at least one of those. Ladies. Wow Nick, thank you for this. - You're welcome, I guess. - Have fun, buddy! Oh, how can I not have fun? I love... prostitutes. Hi, everyone. Oh. Ma'am. How are you this evening? Oh, uh... Okay, would it be possible to spread this over... a few cards? Connor, you okay? - Uh, yeah. - Okay, come on. Connor, how about a smile? So does this make it official, Jennifer? Make what official? The cat's out of the bag. How 'bout a kiss, guys? Um... We like to keep our private lives private. We're not really into public displays, so- Right, hold it, hold it! Perfect! Jennifer, who are you wearing? Let's have some fun tonight. Okay. Quick! Before you go! One more look! What's your favourite Jennifer Bell movie? Oh, my favourite? There's so many. "Dead Heat," "Catching the Sun," uh, "Wild Horses," remember that scene in the water trough? Ravished me. I envy you this. Like, the simplicity of it. Thank you! You're sunbathing, and it's night time. It's pretty amazing. I think you're amazing. Psst-psst-psst-psst-psst! What're we talkin' about? Hey Raquel. How is life? How's the movie goin'? Oh, it's all right. How's uh freakin' Ellen Page? Really nice, right? That's good, I'm glad she's so nice. "Professional Courtesy", it's not a great movie, that scene in the boardroom, if you pause it, you can totally see her nipples. She's got some serious raspberries. I loved "Teenage Wasteland." Let me ask you, how old were you when that aired? - Don't answer that. - Three... Oh. Pfff! Did you say three? How you doin'? You know, every day's a gift. That's why they call it the present. Cheers. "Bridge to Forever," "Crawlspace," "There's no room in the Crawlspace!" She did all her own crossbow work for that, do you know that? Amazing. "Heatstroke," oh, what's that line in "Three to Get Rich?" "Three to Get Rich, Four to Die!" So tell me about this "Nick." How much do I hate him? Nick? No, no, no, you don't hate him, he's no, he's a great guy. We just um, got too serious. Okay, all right, so you need a rebound. Something fun and sexy, and meaningless. Yes, that's exactly what I need. Any ideas? Are you sure this is okay? ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ lay your halo down... ♪ Hey, it's Connor, leave a message. Hey, it's me. Uh... I'm sorry. Call me! Okay, I made a mistake, okay? I shouldn't have told you to take the Jennifer thing, it was on me, I totally, fully, I accept that, but this whole "needing you" thing, like, if I need you then you need me just as much, that's what makes us so great together. It's our mutual co-dependency. Hope you're having fun. Did we break up? When you said you were coming to get your stuff? Was that you breaking up with me? Because I don't agree to that. Okay? Raquel Westbrook does not give up without a fight! Do you hear me? Call me. Turn left. What? Oops. Dammit! Rerouting. Yeah I know, thank you. Turn when possible. All right, how do I- I don't know how to turn this thing off. ♪ I don't wanna wake up ♪ ♪ To this harsh reality ♪ ♪ I just keep my eyes shut ♪ ♪ Let my blindness fool me ♪ ♪ Oooh... ♪
