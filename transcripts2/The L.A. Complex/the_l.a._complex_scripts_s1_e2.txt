 Previously on The "L.A. Complex": I got evicted, I'm super broke, and I threw up on my favourite director. Maybe I don't belong down here. Well, welcome to The Deluxe. Nine months and they haven't listened to a single idea. Well, then force them to listen. We gave you three beats to send to Drake and somehow he ended up getting four. Wait. Did Drake like my beat?

 Abby, I just wanted to introduce you to Connor. His pilot just got picked up, so he's moving into a big new mansion. It's just a house. Your cups empty, let's get you another drink. Were you trying to get them to sleep together? No! You just brought the best looking, most successful dude at the party over to meet the girl that you like. Are you Raquel Westbrook? I grew up idolizing you. What're you doing here? She lives here. You do?! Why? I thought you were gonna get me an audition.

 They wanted someone closer to my age... Next time you're lonely at two in the morning, call someone closer to your age. This Usher tour was the best audition I've ever done. It was only yesterday. I was hoping I would've heard by now. We all should've heard by now. I'm an illegal immigrant; I can't work here. I can get you an under the table job like... tonight. What kind of job? I don't think I can do this in front of all these guys. I won't tell your boyfriend. We broke up this morning. That's not what I'm worried about. You know, if you can get someone to take you That's where you make all the real money anyway. Right. Thank you. Dude, thank you so much. I really needed the money. My regular stand-in was sick.

Oh. Hi, Nick. Sorry, I missed breakfast. Dude, is that your co-star? Yeah, but don't get too excited, you're not working with her. You're a stand-in, so your job is to watch me rehearse, then recreate the blocking exactly so they can light it. - Got it? - Got it. It's for lighting. And I don't get to do it with her? No. You do that with the other stand-in. There she is. This is the best. You got a great look. A curvy Mila Kunis meets like an Asian Jeanne Tripplehorn. Thank you? Who's your agent? How did you know I was an actress? Really? Uh, right. I work with MMG. I'm trying to cast Vanessa Hudgens' sister in this new film. You'd be perfect. - Really? - Can you sing? Yes! Yes, I've been training my entire life. I actually have demos for both if you... You got a great look. Security! Security! What? What're you doing?! You can't do that! Can't do what?!

That's what I was saying! Touching is allowed. Really? Tit grabbing? Oh my God, I want her fired! Okay, calm down. No, get me a girl that knows what she's doing! Someone less new and less stupid! Can I talk to you for a second? Hi, Ron. Oh, uh, so hi, I got you an audition for "Cause of Death"! Really? They're only seeing people today - it's last minute - Uh, hooker role. You think you can find an appropriate outfit? Yeah, I think I can cobble something together. Great. That works. Sorry, we just had to see if your heads block the light. Second team! Whoa, Connor. You got the new pages, right? Yeah, no, it's just, I memorized the old ones... Yeah, I need you to memorize the new ones. Yeah, I'll get it, I'll get it. Please. Do you maybe wanna go to my trailer and just run the pink pages? Sure. Uh, you're leaving? Uh, yeah. But that's why they hired you, man. - To stand in. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's a lot of stuff to keep in my brains. I know. I know it is. Just stay on your marks, you' b be fine. Second team to ones! Yeah, coming at ya! But, uh, what's a "ones"? You wanted to see me? Sit down. I wanna talk to you. What'd I do? You're hungry, you crushed that Drake beat, and you're a hard worker. I mean, you use your brain. I see what you're doing. Thanks, D. I'm gonna give you a chance to produce your own track. For real? With Kaldrick King. Now, hold on. With K-? King is no joke. I mean, what he spits is what you get. From the guns, pitbulls, jail time - all that is for real. I mean, this man is dangerous. So if you don't come with your a-game, he will get real malevolent with you. Malevolent. You understand what I'm saying, right? Uh, yes. There you go using that brain. So when do I start? I mean, I need some time to get some right sounds- - today. - Today? King wants you to meet him at his house. Now. What?! You said you would try to let me go to this audition. - Yeah. - "Try." Come on, man, I'm desperate here. Lunch rush is over; You're not gonna lose any money. Would you just stop talkin' to me like I'm somebody? 'Cause I'm not. I'm just the guy who's gonna get fired if I let you go. Come on, no one's gonna want a dance. Mmm. I wanna dance. I want your dance... Right here. Lexis would be more than happy to take care of you. I bet. Sweetie, would you mind waiting just like an hour? What? Does she know who I am? Everyone's familiar with your work. I mean, you were fantastic in Goonies. See that? Twenty years later and still recognizable. That is how you know you're an icon. Also, I wasn't in Goonies, I was in the other one. Well, that's what I meant. They're both good. Ricky Lloyd, right? My little sister was in love with you. First off, it's Rick. Secondly, don't use past tenses, buddy; Your sister still loves me. Now is there anything more private than that champagne room thing? Why? No, unfortunately- Then I want it! I want it off limits now! I want no one in there for the next hour, except for me and this one. - Go! Get it done. - You got it, Mr. Lloyd. Hey, you know what I'm gonna do for you? I'm gonna sign a headshot for you so you can put it over your bar. - Yeah. - Okay. That's the kinda guy I am. That's a little rude, but I'm gonna follow you. I like where your mind's at. All right. Get yourself comfortable and I'll just wait for the next song. Hey, listen, um... I got you covered, so you can get out of here if you want. I'm sorry? I was just messing with him back there. I overheard you. You've got some place you need to be, right? Like an audition or something? Wait! Are you serious? Don't worry about it. Break a leg. Thank you so much! I'll... I'll be back in an hour, I promise! Don't worry about me. Seriously, I got my "Angry Birds." I got "Cut the Rope," "Doodle Jump." Got the one with the planes. I'm good for like an hour. Connor! Hi, it's me. Um, I'm actually on your lot- sorry, it's Abby. Um, it's presumptuous, I guess, to assume you know me just by saying "me." I was level-jumping our voice mail relationship. Anywho... hello. I have an audition on your lot and I thought that maybe we could hang out, or talk, or... I'd just really like to see you, so... Okay. Bye. Hey! "Cause of Death" audition? Yeah. Oh. Hi. Action! I get it. You wanna keep things professional, right, Sheila? Sorry. Doctor Jennings. Patrick. Fine with me. I'll just pretend last night never happened. Or this morning. - But, Patrick- - Just a moment of weakness. And those aren't allowed, are they, Dr. Jennings? No, we always have to keep things professional, because we deal with life and death every day and there's no room for anything else. I get it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got patients to deal with. Patrick, I'm saying yes. What? What're you doing? Uh, I-it's for lighting? Yo! Hi, I'm Tariq. I'm with Dynasty. Dynasty's assist... um... producer. Mm-hm. Dynasty said that I was supposed to come over? Cool. Maybe we can just get started, talk about what kind of sound you're looking for. I brought a few samples- Hey, whoa-whoa-whoa, little man, I don't know you. Uh, Dynasty said that we were working together today? I don't work with people I don't know. I was told that you wanted me here, - but if not... - Wanted you here? I told you to come here, but not to talk music. Move! I gotta know somebody before I agree to work with 'em - know who they are, and what they about; if they're real or a punk-ass bitch. Today's your audition. We're taking your car; I got DUI's. Okay. Where we going? You gonna show me some place important to you. Important? Is this your car? Uh... yeah. Image is everything. Strike one. + Got me sweating like a crackhead out here. Um, I'm sorry, there's no parking in front. Look, it's just up here. So? Tell me about your pops, or what kind of 'hood you grew up in? Something. Uh, um... If you gonna have me walking, you better not make it boring. Uh, I don't know. My dad was a dry cleaner. He worked hard. Drove a cab sometimes. Speak up. I don't really know him that well - because he was always working, - like all the time. - As for the streets, - I grew up in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. In what? Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. It's a neighbourhood in Montreal. And y'all didn't give that a nickname or something? Och-town? Big Neuve? Nope. Sorry. You shouldn't be apologizing. The people that named that town should be apologizing. It's like having to tell somebody you from Faggotsberg or somethin'. Sorry, I know it's not Oakland. There you go with those apologies again. Must be a Canadian thing. Oh, now you mad. Hey! Hard to get don't work on me, boy. Ask any bitch who's tried it. Yo, yo, yo, yo. I just asked you where you's from, bro. There's no right or wrong answer, so stop acting like I'm interrogating you. Yeah, well you sort of are. I know, but I'm telling you stop acting like it. Just makes things more difficult. Let your shoulders down, take a deep breath and exhale. Take the coat hanger out your shirt. All right, how's this? It's a start. So I guess you speak French? Ben, oui. "Ben, oui." Yeah. I like that. That's good. We're here. What the hell did I say? This place has the best stacks in the city for vintage vinyl. I said this wasn't about the music! Now, that's strike two! You got one more chance to show me some place important to you. Matter of fact, why the hell am I walking anyway? Come 'round here and get my ass. When did you get these? - Hello? - So hi, how'd it go? I haven't gone yet. What? I haven't gone yet. Who's Avi Goldblatt? I haven't gone yet. Quiet. 'Kay. Bye. Raquel? Good luck. - Kay! - How are you, sweetheart? You look great! Thank you! Look at you. - Hi! - Raquel! Hey! This isn't... We're not... I don't have a shot with you, right? Okay, so let me ask you something. What's my problem? Do you know? Because I don't. I mean, I know I'm terrible with female-women, but I don't know how, and I don't know what I'm doing. I'm doing something. What is it? Like this girl, she just moved into my building, and she's... Oh, she's amazing, and we're totally clicking, and you know what she does? She sleeps with someone else. And here's the thing... I knew it! Just like the second you smiled at me, I knew I'd screw it up. And now, here I'm am. My whole life is awkward hugs with beautiful women. So go ahead, I can take it. Tell me what I'm doing wrong. First of all, you talk too much. Oh, hey! There she is! Thank you so much. So how'd it go? I got cut. Turns out they're only looking for teenagers. I'll get changed really quick. Uh, you know what? Take your time. I will give you some privacy. What's your deal? Why're you so nice? Good upbringing? No, why'd you cover for me? I've seen you. You're... You're a really good dancer. Like really good. I dunno, the question is, what's your deal? You know, what're you doin' here? It's a good job. That's about it. Getting naked's never really been a big deal for me. Guess that makes me a weirdo to some people. I don't think that's weird. That's a skill. You're just biding your time until you book something, break outta here. I say good for you. Right. Good for me. Uh-oh. Wait a minute. Oh yeah, I know what this is. You got the "I didn't get it" post audition mopes. Tell you what, you shouldn't go on the floor right now. We'll go into the bar, drink some drinks, until you, you know, remember you're awesome and stuff. Why'd you cover for me - for real? Like I said, I think you're a really good dancer. Why'd you cover for me? 'Cause I made a classic 20 years ago, and I've been straight-to-DVD ever since. So I know how hard chances are to come by. All right. "All right" you're gonna let me buy you a drink? Is that what we're saying? Great! Okay, let's do it. You didn't bring your sides. Are you off-book already? My sides? I didn't know we'd be, uh... Rehearsing. Wh-what do you mean? I thought that's what we're doing. No. I misunderstood. What'd you think I said? I heard what you said, I just... I thought it was code. You thought "let's rehearse" was a code? No, you said that you wanted to "run the pink pages." It sounded dirty. - No, oh no... - Look. Just forget I said anything. I thought you were, uh, less new. I've done enough of these to know that it's gonna happen anyway. But hey, if you want to pretend to be noble for a while, - be my guest. - Wait! Look, it's not that I'm not interested. I just... I think we both want this show to be good, right? And that could make things complicated. I just thought if we focus on the job, maybe work at that... Are you still trying to get me to run lines with you? No, no. Absolutely not. Dude! Kaldrick King! Kaldrick King, the king of Cali! Oh, I am tweeting this. I am tweeting this. "I'm blowin my ish on the itches I fizz!" That's not the words. Who are they? I just know the radio edit, Mr. King. "About to play Kaldrick King in ping pong!" These are my neighbours- ♪ fresh outta lock-down, representin' o-town, ♪ ♪ Ain't no other bigga six figure trigga mm-mm... ♪ Strike three! Hey! Do you know why I brought you here? I didn't say the word. Look, I do not have important places in L.A. I'm not from here. I don't have time to sight-see. You don't wanna talk about work? Well, you know what? This is where I sleep. Because that's all I ever do - work and sleep. Now you know me. What's French for hungry? What? Let's go get some taquitos. Come on. + Hey, haven't-gone-yet, you're about to go. What? You're up. Okay. How'd that go? It happened so fast. Let's get outta here. Look, you're a cute guy, but you're too busy thinking, "does she like me, does she like me" to even notice if she actually likes you. You're not pickin' up the signs, you don't listen, so by the time you get up your guts and make a move, she's on to a real man. You think I'm cute! Did you hear the part where I said you don't listen? But what are these signs I'm supposed to look for? I've read about maintaining eye contact, initiating touches, or, you know, if they lean in, I'm supposed to like... It's not poker tells. Is she making an effort to see you, spend time with you? Things like that. But, see, now you're touching me, and there's leaning happening. I gotta say, these seem like signs to me. Do you see what you're doing? And do you see how you're thinking about it instead of acting on it? You want me to act on it? No. I'm very confused. Because you think too much! Just trust your gut, and when you feel the connection, just kiss her. First team! No! I hate you because you're stupid. Stupid because I think too much. - There you go. - Trust my gut. Don't think. Now you got it. Hmm. Great. Background... And action! I get it. You wanna keep things professional, right, Sheila? Sorry. Doctor Jennings. - Patrick. - Fine with me. I'll just pretend last night never happened. Or this morning. Patrick! Just a moment of weakness. And those aren't allowed, are they, Dr. Jennings? No, we always have to be perfect, because we deal with life and death everyday and there's no room for anything else. I get it. Now if you'll excuse me, I have patients to deal with. Patrick... I'm saying yes. Cut! Tail slate! Tail slate on b. Going again! You're wrapped. Oh, okay. Uh, hey, it was nice... Oh, and... Where do I...? Not talking to anyone. Okay, uh... this way. Two days ago, I gave the best audition of my entire life for this Usher tour, didn't get a call. Oh, they're idiots, okay? They probably just gave it to some producer's cousin's friend or something - somebody they know already. How do I get known? I mean, I'm never more than a number to these guys. Careful what you wish for. There's a guy over here who's been staring at me for 20 minutes because he "knows me." Hey! Goonies, right? No, I'm not Goonies, I'm the other one. - Oh right! Right! - All right. You know, I know what they see. Blonde, boobs, high voice; I use it to my advantage. Let everyone underestimate me, but I'm working the hardest. That's smart. I try and do that too. I've been in acting conservatories, I do a bunch of theater, I even won awards. But it's not enough to be good sometimes. They're gonna see what they see. Here. To our success. To our future success. Mmm. Ew! That's cute. Okay, I'm gonna go. I got this big important telethon for ugandan kids. They need... No, no, no. Wait. All right, it's a vodka launch party, but I still gotta go. I don't wanna owe you anything, so please just at least let me buy you a shot. Why don't you come to the party with me? Right. Okay, look, we're not supposed to... stop, stop, stop. I know what you're thinking and that's not why I'm asking. We won't even touch. Pinky swear. A pinky swear is touching. Okay, look. I go to these stupid things because there's important people there, and I just... On the off chance that hard work is not enough, I thought maybe it'd be nice for you to find a producer's cousin's friend of your own. All right. All I do is wait for the phone to ring, then finally when my crap agent does get me in a room somewhere, it's over in five seconds! Now where am I? Back to waiting for my phone to ring. Yeah, we all are. That's the way it goes. No, no. They know who you are, okay? I-I'm new. Nobody knows me. I have to make an impression every single time I'm in there or they won't call again. I don't even think they looked up. Look, you can't kill yourself over every audition. You just have to do them and forget about it. Not all of them are gonna be winners for you, but some will. Assuming you don't totally suck. Thanks. I know you think we're different... Hello? Really? That's crazy! I just came from it. So we'll know tonight? Great. Yeah, you too. Bye. Oh, they put a pin in me. Oh. Means I'm on hold for the part. Oh, that's awesome. Great. Good for you. No big deal. It's just a guest star. Uh, do you know where Connor's set is? It's on this lot, right? Yeah. Is he expecting you? No, I just thought that... Sweetie, it's really poor form to drop by someone's set unannounced. That's okay, you didn't know; you're new. Look, I'd love to give you a ride back to the Lux, but I have a big meeting in the valley with a producer, so... You're okay for bus fare? I'm good. Great. You got these in Frenchtown? No, fortunately. Yo, I know you think we're a lot different, but really we're not. My pops is a con, yours is a workaholic, but they taught us the same thing. Work, sleep, and nothin' else. You bust your ass and do whatever it takes. That's what a real man is. Got me into trouble though. When I was a lil' gangsta, I did whatever it took... And did a bid for it. But see, that's what people respond to. When I spit, ain't no sensationality. I'm just speaking the truth. Just being me and tellin' the world to deal with it. So why haven't you made an album in years? Truth changes. I ain't the same person no more. I ain't out here running the streets and hustling. But they still want those same verses though. It's like you're still a prisoner. You're exactly right, man. I gotta let you talk more often. You a'right. Yo, how do you say "man" in French? How do you say that? Homme. Om? Come on, don't laugh at me, bro. H-o-m-m-e. Are you serious? Wait-wait-wait. So you're telling me the French word for man is "home"? Mm-hm. Oh, that's brilliant! You gotta teach me some more of this French. I'm a huge fan, man. Ungh! Did I say you could take my picture? Did I?! Do something! Get up! Get up and do something! Yeah, I thought so. Let's go. I said, let's go! + Hey, Abby! Hey, Eddie, what's...? Oh, I was just doing some cleaning in there. Had to move some of your stuff so I could get into the corners. Can I see your keys for a minute please? I can't let you stay here anymore. Wait, what? I'm really sorry, but the owners are coming by here today and if they found out I was letting you stay here for free, they would fired me. And you seem like a really sweet kid and I don't know where your clothes are, but- please, Eddie, I don't have anything right now. Okay, then I got no choice. I gotta evict you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have anywhere else to live. Please! Please don't use your fancy actor tricks on me, okay? I'm sorry. Eddie, please! It looks like I'm a big shot, but I have no power. Thank God. Eddie kicked me out and I can't get Tariq on the phone and I thought of you. I don't know how you feel about this, but could I crash here for just one week, tops? I swear to God, I'll make it worth your while. Uh, you know what? Sure. That's a lovely outfit you've got on. Cast as a manwhore. It's the perfect role for you. Said the one dressed like a hooker. Mm. What can I say? I've got range. Whatever gets you through the night. Looks like she went open mouth - unprofessional. Think she just got a little carried away. She's a hack. I shoulda got that part. They went younger. And sluttier. Said the one dressed like a hooker. You said that one. I'm on hold for "cause of death." Hey! Congrats. What's your story? I nailed the master, but I screwed up the coverage, so- whatever. You wrapped? Yeah. And didn't get fired. Great. Let's go celebrate. Really? You didn't get the part yet. That's, like, bad mojo. They put a pin in me. There's no such thing as a jinx in an industry that uses voodoo lingo. It's all bad mojo here, so let's just go drink and smoke and... Act like we don't care for a bit. Thinking about it? Is that what you're playing? 'Cause it's not believable. Cougar. Child. Um... I actually kinda have a big day tomorrow, so... You what? Yeah, I'm gonna take a rain check. I just wanna focus on one thing at a time. But I'm dressed like a hooker. What's this? Oh, uh, no-no-no, that's not what it looks like. That's nou-nou my nighttime bear. I can't fall asleep unless I'm holding him. Really?! I was- that's a joke. You thought I was serious? I don't know what you're into, man. All right, what is wrong? I don't know. I mean, what's right. I have no money, I don't have an apartment, I blew an audition, I smell like the bus. Okay, wait, wait, wait. How do you know you blew an audition? I just know. Did you not get laughs? It wasn't a comedy. Then, did you get laughs? No. Then, did they boo? Did they say, "you're through, kid, hit the bricks"? Well, so then how do you know they didn't like you? I just... know it. Okay, I'm sorry, but aren't you the girl who barfed on a piano? Didn't your car blow up on the 405? I think it's been pretty well established that you don't know anything about anything. So you think I might be wrong? I'm saying you're probably wrong, given your track record. Look, you had a bad day. So let's just stay in tonight, we'll watch a movie and curl up on the couch with nou-nou? I dare you to keep your hands off him, he's adorable. Where's this couch we're supposed to curl up on? Oh, a bed, couch, what's the difference. How do you feel about "the notebook"? You have "the notebook"? Yeah. I haven't seen it, should we give that a shot. It's so good. You're gonna love it. All right. So you have a teddy bear and "The Notebook"... Hey, it's Abby, leave a message. Hey, I got your message and yes - absolutely yes - I'm in for all those things. Hanging out and talking and seeing you and... I can't remember what else you suggested, but I'm in. Um, so listen, I'm done for the day here, so I was thinking of maybe coming by the Lux. Maybe you'll be there. I really hope so. It's Connor, by the way. Okay. Connor! Oh. Thanks. Is this next episode? This episode. Total rewrite for tomorrow. Cool? Wait. All this for tomorrow? Yeah, and we've moved up your call time too. It's all on there. See this girl here? She reps the pussycat dolls. Really? Yeah. We'll meet her inside. I'm up. All right. Hey, everybody. And label out. There it is. Hello. Hello. Come on. Oh... No, no, no... Watch. Watch what happens. Come on. Mm-hm. Okay. Is my boob out or something? Uh, no. This is just generally something that happens when hot girls stand in front of cameras. Hey, Ricky! Ricky! What's your girl's name?! Uh, it's Alicia lowe. Is it really? That is much better than lexis, I have to tell you. I'm Rick. It's nice to meet you in the real world, Alicia. It's nice to be here, Rick. Again. Yeah. Come on, man, I know you broke and everything, but I gave those to give to them. Use 'em! Can I ask you something? Before you even start, you don't know nothing. A'right? I'm a celebrity and everybody wants a piece of me. So if I wanna protect those pieces, I gotta get a little militant sometimes. Besides, that dude's a fan; He knows I'm violent. Hell, that's what he "loves" about me. I just did him a favour. I made his wish come true. You still got something you wanna ask me? No. I get it. You punch people because you got nothing to rap about. That's why you stopped making albums. Because if you were "real," you'd be rapping about your gated community and how much tax you pay. So you figure if you keep punching people, getting DUI's, maybe you get a verse out of it. But that ain't real. And I thought "real" is what you're all about. Are you gonna hit me? I don't know, keep talkin'. + No, I hear what you sayin', and that's cool for Wayne, a-and Kanye and them, but not for the king. They want this from the king, and this. That right there? They want me to rap about that chick making her ass clap. But what they don't want is change. Not from me. So even if you're not feeling it, you're stuck being what you are. Lucky for me, that's a millionaire. See, I thought what people respond to is honesty. Says who? You. Your words. Will you stop listening so hard? Damn, man, you're like a narc. Only you rat me out to me. Oh, come on now, man, when the king is droppin' wisdom, I gots to pick it up. Oh, now you wanna try to kiss my ass? Before, it was, "you don't have nothin' to rap about." No, no, no, I never said that. You just said I wasn't real. That's even worse. I'm just saying that this guy right here?
