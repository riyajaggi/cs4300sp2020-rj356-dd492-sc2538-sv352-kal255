 Previously on The "L.A. Complex": Everyone here does laundry, right? If you guys have any constructive criticism, I'd love to hear it. You should quit. Could I crash here for just one week, tops? Sure. What? What're you doing? What? What're you doing? Tell me what I'm doing wrong. I'm gonna give you a chance to produce your own track

 with Kaldrick king. King is no joke. What he spits is what you get. Come 'round here and get my ass! I mean, this man is dangerous. Did you guys actually write this? Did you actually read it? I'm with the biggest agency in town, and I'm gonna walk this into them and get it made. What's in it for you? I'm playing the lead. I gave the best audition of my entire life for this Usher tour,

 didn't get a call. It's not enough to be good sometimes. They're gonna see what they see. I really like you. I really like you. You're like a narc, only you rat me out to me. I'm just saying that this guy right here, that's the man I wanna know more about. You need to leave. What? Get out. Hi. "Cause of death." I'm Abby Vargas. Who? I'm playing the prostitute. I had to take the bus here, and I was worried I was gonna be late so I guess I way overshot it to be on the safe side... great. Great story. The trailers are down here. Um, actually, if I have a bit of time, do you mind pointing me in the direction of "the critical unit" set? My friend plays Patrick on the show. We're not really friends, I don't know what we are. We're just kind of... So we'll see you in an hour? Connor? Knock knock... Abby! I'm sorry. Oh, come on... You didn't even lock the door? Aggghhhh! Abby! + ♪ You showed up at my door today ♪ ♪ An inglorious surprise ♪ ♪ I hesitate, heed the one inside ♪ ♪ What's inside I realize ♪ ♪ We're more alike than I'd admit ♪ ♪ wearing your disguise ♪ ♪ well, two steps forward... ♪ - Nick! - What time is it? Ten A.M. Did you sleep in Eddie's office? Well, it's a little foggy. I drank a bottle of peach schnapps with Kevin and cam last night. Ew! Don't drink schnapps. Ugh! I feel like I might have diabetes now. I still don't understand why you slept in Eddie's office. Well... Abby got evicted and I said she could stay with me for a little while and then... Tell me you didn't try to kiss her. Well, I thought she wanted me to! Nick! She just hooked up with Connor. I know. I was just... I thought we had a moment and... Anyway, now I feel uncomfortable being in my own room. So that's where my life is at. What'd you get up to? I actually went out. I met this really cool guy, and he took me to this great party, I met all these people. Really? Come on, handsome, I'm gonna take you to breakfast. Oh, good. It tastes like the sugar plumb fairy took a dump in my mouth. And this is why we don't drink schnapps. Ah, yes. Do you guys smell that? No. I don't smell... Oh my God, you guys reek. Where did you get these suits? We got them at a vintage store. Well, you smell like rotten soup. Are they gonna be much longer? Agents are always twenty minutes late. We didn't bring a copy of the script. We should've brought one. They might have notes or something. Relax. This is just a preliminary meeting where we figure out which producers to sell it to. Right. Right. Hey, guys, so Stacey's gonna be another 45 minutes or so. Forty-five minutes? Are you serious? Did you guys need some more water? No. We have some, thanks. Okay. I'll let you know when she's ready. We gotta go. You what?! We're getting paid two grand to shoot a kid's bar Mitzvah this afternoon. If we wait 45 minutes, we're not gonna make the ceremony. Do you have any idea where you are right now? This is much more important than some... nothing in my life is more important than making two grand right now. You said it's just a preliminary meeting. But, I mean, if you think they need to meet us and get a sense of who we are... okay, you know what? No. Uh, it's okay. Go to the bar Mitzvah, and I will make up some excuse. 'Kay, let's go. Abby! Can you wait? Look... Oh my... Are you okay? No, I'm not okay! I have to be on camera in an hour and I'm bleeding from the head! Okay, I'm sorry. It's not like we were even dating. I mean, you have a boyfriend. I broke up with him. You... really? I thought that... Forget it. No, what? What were you gonna say? I don't remember, I hit my head! I thought you weren't available! But if you're telling me you are, then... could you have a shower before we have this conversation?! Okay, look, I'm sorry... Dead hooker! Where've you been? Make-up's been looking for you every-oh. They already found you. That looks great. Um, no, actually, this is real. Am I gonna get fired? Well, I doubt it. Your character dies from a head wound, that's perfect. Yeah, but what about the diner scenes, when I'm "alive" hooker? Those scenes have been omitted. Now you're just dead hooker. Wait, I don't have any lines? Or movement! Abby! Don't. Just don't. It's my go-to move, baby! Dude, you would've been proud. I would've won the Oscar, baby! I'm telling you, I was like, "this is what they want," and this, but that ain't the real me. "I'm different now." Come on, yo. That don't work! Well, I was ridin' that thing like seabiscuit! Woo! Giddy-up! Hey yo. Yo, Tariq, did you meet this girl? Nah, he'd already left by then. You left?! Why? What happened? She didn't have another girlfriend with her?! I um... Look, it was late, and I just wanted to get ready for today. Oh, that's a good excuse. Yeah. Well, let's hear it, man. Come on. No shame. It's funny, it's got heart. They just don't write scripts like this anymore. It's an amazing part for me, and I think we can do it pretty cheap so... let me stop you. You're right, doesn't need selling. Let's just talk strategy. I haven't read the script. What? We don't think you're a fit for this agency anymore. We've been given a corporate-wide directive to streamline our rosters. Excuse me? You've become very hard to justify internally. What... What does that even mean? Well, you haven't booked anything in... Two years, so... Yes, I have, you've just made me turn those down. The hallmark movie, the Sci-Fi thing... sharktagator whatever... you said they were bad for my "brand." And I stand by those decisions. But this is the best agency in town and we just can't afford to spend time on talent development. You know what? This is a great script and you didn't even read it. This is why we turned those other things down. And by the way, I would've torn up sharktapus! You know, a lot of people watch those things! "Justify me internally?!" Ten years ago, I could've gotten you fired! Good luck, Raquel. + Well, maybe it's for the best. Okay, you don't know what you're talking about, so just let me drink my drink and be depressed. I'm just saying, maybe they're right. Too far the other way now. Maybe they were too big for you. You were getting lost there. You know how I know? Because you told me you were getting lost there. You've been talking about leaving them for like a year. So you got what you wanted. Go call your manager, get him to set up meetings at smaller agencies tomorrow... ones who'll be excited to have you, ones who realize how amazing you are. I mean, you know you're amazing, right? Come here. You're a good guy, Nick. Thanks. Tell your friends. Okay. Well, I gotta go. I'm late for A.A. A.A.? You're not... I... Wait, you were just- that's not... I just go for the networking. Well, maybe listen to what they have to say. ♪ Having a hard time ♪ ♪ In this crazy town ♪ ♪ Having a hard time ♪ ♪ There's no love to be found ♪ It takes the sample, makes it fuller, more aggressive, without losing all that raw sadness. King wants this to be a track about who he really is, not all of that- Something wrong? Not feeling it. This is what we talked about. I'm not feelin' it. All right. Can you be a little bit more specific? - What I said - I'm not feelin' it! It's not my job to explain why. It's your job to bring me something I like. Do your job! You know what? Hold up. He didn't mean that. No, I know exactly what he meant. And I didn't come here to work with some kid, I came to work with you. You are working with me. Listen, I got some tracks you can listen to right now. No. Not today we can't. Today is done. Come on, y'all. We're out. What was that? This is what he wanted last night. Well, it sure has hell ain't what he wanted today. So do you want anything in particular here? Like a, um, look of horror, or eyes wide open? Eyes closed, as neutral as possible. You know, like a dead person. No! Tell me what's wrong with this. Hmm. Come on. Tell me what's wrong with this. What? Her face, I can see her face. On all my ride-alongs the bag was always closed. I know. But we figured if we see her face... yeah, well, why don't we just get Joe and Paul down here, huh? Because this, it's not working. All right. Zip it up. W-w-w-wait! If we zip this up, won't I suffocate? Breathe shallow, dead hooker. Really?! No, no, no. We already talked about this. I don't care, just tell him anything. Hey! Hey, dude. What's up? Just tell him I need to approve all post decisions, that's it. All right. Yeah. How you doing, man? Good, good. Really good. Great! Have a seat. Sit down. Okay. So how goes it? Good. Great. I mean, yeah, it's a lot of work... But you know what? A lot of this is my fault. Kinda threw you to the wolves, and that really isn't fair. What do you mean? What's, what's your fault? Well, normally we'd have a rehearsal period so you can get your bearings, but, you know, we just didn't have time; This is TV. And I wanna make it up to you, all right? I've got a good old friend of mine, he's phenomenal. We're gonna bring him in to work with you. What, like an acting coach... For everybody? No, he's more of a one on one guy. He's a prof at UCLA. You're gonna love him. You know, if it's all the same to you, I'm... I'm not sure I want to... I think I'd probably just prefer to keep working with you and the directors and... yeah, well, you know, it's not all the same to me. I'd like to bring him in, give it a try. He's a bit of a miracle worker. Sure. Not a bad idea. Yeah. I didn't think so. Hello? Nick! Hey, how's it going, mate? Oh, good. You know, just... Just working out, getting some writing done, you know. Listen, you remember those pills I gave you? Yeah, the ones you were throwing out? Yeah. Um... Did you sell them by any chance? Uh, yeah. Why, did you want half the money? 'Cuz we never really talked about that. No. Uh, no, no. I just um... Okay, good, 'cuz I already spent it. Don't worry about it. Oh, hey, can you ask someone over there when I'm gonna get my check for the stand-in work? Yeah, I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Hey. Ninety-ninety, okay? All right? Hey, Tom! Hey! Oh, I forgot to tell you, I saw that episode of "the office" you directed. So good. Really funny. Oh, hey, thanks, Raquel. Thanks a lot. Yeah. It's just too bad I was to young for that guest star. No, I know. Yeah. I don't have much of a hand in casting. All right, folks, let's get started. See ya in there. I just felt like I couldn't get any lower than that, that had to be my bottom. I get up, I get dressed, then I go out. My husband started drinking around me again and I don't know how to tell him to stop. If you had told the twelve-year old me that I was going to grow up to be the most successful dentist in Beverly Hills, I probably would have punched myself in the face. I mean, I wanted to be in show business. And that's the last time I remember actually wanting something. And I realize how pathetic that is (because a) It's show business (and b) It was thirty years ago, but uh... I'm sober now, and I'm trying to figure out what I'm gonna do for the rest of my life, - and that's what I keep- How I really need something, I need to want something. I need to do something different because this... This isn't working. Hey, Gary. Raquel. It's Gary, right? How's it going? Oh, you know. One day at a time, right? That's the rumor. Listen, I don't wanna be crass, but... I hear what you were saying up there and um... I have a really great script... If that's something you're interested in doing. Are you pitching me a script... At A.A.? Well, I'm-I'm sorry, you said you didn't want to be crass. Well, which what part of this isn't crass? Okay, I just-not interested. Hey, tom. Not cool, Raquel. Yeah, I'm not in goonies, I'm in the other one. Okay. Thank God you're here! I realized I didn't get your number. I know, I know. I'm so happy you're working here. I can't stop thinking about last night. Me neither. Can I-um, I wanna ask you something. Can you maybe sit down here for a second? Okay. 'Kay. Okay, so I know we like just met, but I feel really connected to you, and really safe, and uh... Uh, I don't know how to say this... Just say it. Alicia... Alicia, would you consider making a sex tape with me? + You want to make a sex tape? Uh... Ricky! Uh, Gavin! This is Gavin. Gavin, this is... Gavin Morrison. Ricky speaks very highly of you and I can sure see why. I'm sorry, who are you? Oh, yeah, right. Sorry. I'm, I'm Ricky's manager. I was just bringing her up to speed. Great! Sorry. Oh, I see, so... okay. What no one really talks about, Alicia, is that there's a lot of money to be made here. Now, publicly, of course, we act as though the tape was "leaked," "never meant to be seen," just two young people recording their lovemaking for their own viewing pleasure. It'd just be the two of us, I'd film it. Absolutely, it needs to look amateur. Well, I'm pretty good with a camera, so... Now I've had some preliminary talks with a lot of companies and they're all very interested. We're talking about a very big payday up front, as well as a substantial portion of the back end in terms of sales. And that's... That's for both of us. Thanks for thinking of me, but... Colin Farrell, Pam Anderson, Paris Hilton, Fred durst, Kendra Wilkinson, Paris Hilton again, Pamela Anderson again. I mean, you'd be hard-pressed to find a sex tape out there that hasn't raised the stock of both parties involved. I got it. I mean, okay, maybe you won't be the next Kim Kardashian, but at the very least, you know, it's a very big payday and then after that I can book you into all kinds of club appearances and parties across the country. But that's the thing, remember last night? All those people you met? That's nothing. In the next six months, you're gonna meet more people than you can imagine. You'll be Google-able after this. Think about that. Now, I'll be honest, I'm jealous. I'd kill to do a sex tape with Ricky Lloyd, but God made me the wrong kind of lady. That's... You know, normally the only downside here is that, you know, people are gonna wanna see you naked, but in your particular case... Okay, look. I know it's a lot, Alicia, but just know that I don't wanna do this with anyone else. I really like you. Stop talking to me like I'm a stripper. Oh, wow... sorry. Why do you want to do this? I'm telling you, I'm really comfort... why do you want to do this? Look, working hard isn't working and being good isn't good enough. No matter what I do, I can't get noticed, and so I need to do something that's different. That sound like anyone you know? Am I good to go? Oh, yup. I've got your contract right here. Hold up, this isn't right. I'm supposed to be paid a lot more than this. Yeah, you were also supposed to have lines and be seen on camera. You're lucky they only downgraded you to S.O.C. No, no... Get my agent on the phone, 'cuz this isn't gonna fly. We called him already. He signed off on it, so... He did? Yeah, I mean, you don't have to sign it, but we can't process the checks until you do, so... it's fine. Can someone at least give me a drive home? If you don't mind waiting a couple of hours. Never mind. Nice working with you, dead hooker! Uh, okay, here we go. Glass blowing... That's a weird profession. Do you have any idea how many glasses you have to blow just to get your foot in the door? Uh... I... uh... And you know, I'm from Canada, which is weird. You know, people-watching? Why don't they call it "watching people"? The thing that I hate about, about cereal... I don't even know what you're talkin' about, fella! Oh... Hoo-ah! You know what I'm talkin' about, you know what I'm talkin' about... You know what that is? That... It's the United States of bananas. I'm Tim Sheppard, good night. That's why they need time. Because they connected to it so much. That doesn't make sense. They're talent, agents, right? So they want to pass it on to literary guys and get them stoked on it. You guys might even up getting rep'd because this. For real? They said that. Yeah. I wish you guys could've been there. Oh my God, this is amazing! This and Ellen page in the same day! W-w-w-what about Ellen page? Our friend Steve kinda knows Ellen page and he said he'd get the script to her. Why would you do that? What do you mean? If she said yes, we'd... No, I thought we were doing this movie together. We are. You haven't raised any money yet, so... Why not keep our options open, right? Right? Look, if our script is so good, why don't you option it from us? Give us some cash. Otherwise, I don't see why... Okay, first of all, I just walked your script into the biggest agency in town and have them thinking of representing you, so, you're welcome. But if you want me to stop that, then just say the word and all that goes away. You need me. And I'm telling you, I want a three-month exclusive on this or I walk. Right now. Your choice, boys. Okay. Okay. I really don't like this side of you. Well, I don't like your handshake. So cheers! To loyalty! ♪ Sick and tired, always wanting never satisfied ♪ ♪ Now we'll see it like it really isn't ♪ ♪ Very wide awake and done with faking ♪ ♪ Passing by and now we're moving to another place... ♪ I'm in trouble, dude. If he tells them... why would he tell them? He'd have to out himself too. He was in prison. Maybe it's like a weird power-thing. He's not going to out you. I'd be done. They won't fire you just 'cause you're gay. Trust me, I'd be lucky if all they do is fire me. They don't know it yet, but they hate me. I don't know what to tell you. I don't know how to help. Just, just tell me it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. Nope. Didn't buy it. I don't blame you... I literally couldn't act my way out of a plastic bag today. Hey, it's Abby. Leave a message. Hey... Lily, right? Hey. You look like you could use some company. Yeah. You wanna go get a beer? Yes! Yeah, sure. Come on, let's go. Just leave that. Yeah. Wow, you're still here? Yes. After a set like yours, most people get the hell outta dodge. I would, but I have nowhere to go. I can't go back to my apartment because there's a girl there. Yeah, you wanna stay away from there. It's complicated. It always is. This guy broke up with me today. I didn't even like him. Pisses me off. Thanks. Ugh... I'm sorry. Well, stick around, I'll try and cheer you up. How? With your words? Right. No, I need me a good old fashioned blackout drunk. Let's do some things we'll regret tonight. You're funny. And you're not. True story. Are you ready for this? Not even a little bit. Cheers. Cheers. Oh really? Already? Okay. Mmm! Get the door! Oh, uh... Oh yeah! Yeah, like that! Don't you treat me gentle! I wouldn't think of it. Choke me. What? Choke me. Oh, uh, you know, I'm good. It's okay, I like it. Oh, I'm just not really the... choke me, Tim! Do it! Choke me out! Uh, okay. Um... uh... For serious? No no no - okay - choke me for real come on okay, really forget it. I'll call someone and get it done no no no, I can do this Yeah? Yeah, absolutely. All right. Here we go. Okay. Yeah... Just choke... Meghan? Meghan?! Oh my God, oh my God! Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. N-n-not murder. You're just sleeping. Right, so... This is what counts as a win now. + Morning. Morning. Hey, can you run these with me? Oh, sorry, I gotta be there half an hour before call, so I should go. Okay. Um... I'll drive you. All right. But I don't think you're called... it's fine. It's not a problem. Did you sleep? Yeah, I'm fine. Morning. Morni-what the f... what're you doing here?! Oh, well, you invited me over, and I didn't... you passed out after I choked you, so... what did you do to me? No, no, no, you wanted me to, remember? But then you passed out, so... so you kept going?! No! No, no, no. I stopped. I definitely stopped, but uh-but then... you know, I just-you had a lot to drink last night, so... oh, you're gonna get all judgey on me now? That's attractive. Okay, I think I'm gonna take off. Actually, do you mind if I take a shower... get out! Okay. I'll just fly down to Miami. I'll do it next week. You wanted to see me? I don't want you in the studio today. Wait, what? D... Look, I'm not saying this is forever, all right? 'Cause I like what you put together for him. But producing is more than just making good beats, it's also about managing the artist. Listen, he is like... he doesn't like you. So he's not gonna like anything you have to offer, no matter how good it is. This isn't fair. Why don't you wash my cars and I'll call you if I need anything. That's what I'm talking about! And wash that look off your face too, Tariq! Shut up. You gotta tell him though, you know what I mean? No, thank you for meeting with me. Water? You got anything stronger? Kidding. Water's great. Uh, I just felt like... It was time for a change. I felt like we were growing apart. I left, they didn't. I don't know where people are hearing that from. Actually, there's a script... It's amazing. Uh, no. No producers. Not yet. No. No stars. Well, I mean, I'm in it, but... I just think it could be like a really good comeback role. N-not that I went away... Or anything. Uh, how do I see myself? That's... That's a good question. No, no, uh... Well, I'm unique. I'm kind of an "every girl." Uh, I'm like Carey mulligan. No, I know Cary mulligan's only twenty-three. I'm just ready to work. Yeah, I just wanna work. I'm just ready to work. Thank you, but you won't be moving on today. Thank you for seeing me. Okay, I understand. Mm-hmm. Oh, well, it was a pleasure meeting you. Hey! Hi! Uh, Gary, right? I'm Raquel. I'm a friend of bill's. Oh, I remember. I wanted to apologize. I have no idea what I'm doing lately. It's okay. No, it's not. This is stupid, but um... I'm just gonna be honest with you... Mm-hmm. I'm still not good at talking to people sober. Me neither. Probably wasn't good at talking to people drunk either, but... Right, but now it's a lot harder to forget. Yeah. Look, I'm sorry too. I was a little harsh. Well, I deserved it. No, you didn't. Okay... well... Well... I'm not good at handshakes either. All right. Well, okay. Do you wanna go practice talking sober somewhere? Sure. Yeah? Great. Yeah. All right. Okay. Hey, by the way, how did you... I Google stalked you. Right. Abby? Yes... - Nick? - Agh! Agh! Abby. Alicia came by earlier. She wanted to talk to you. Uh... okay. Uh, any other messages? Are you avoiding me? Am I-no, I'm showering. Because I haven't seen you in, like, days. Yeah, I got busy with the busyness... It's my busy time now, so... So we're good? Yeah. Great! Great. Anyways, "cause of death" was a total disaster, so I'm still super-broke and homeless. Do you mind if I stay here a couple more days? Yeah. Uh, sure. Really? Yeah. Oh, gosh, Nick, I love you. You're a superstar. Cool. Well, if you could just... So you wanna stay in tonight? Maybe not spend money? Be depressed? Sounds fun, right? Sure does, but I can't, 'cause I have a set of the comedy tonight, so. Really? Is it free? Can I come? Well, it is free, but, you know, you shouldn't come. My act is kind of in a nascent stage right now... Nick, I wanna do something that doesn't involve me staying home. Please? Okay. Awesome. Well, scrub-a-dub, buddy. Yeah! Oh, she's driving me crazy! I wish you would talk to her. Mom, I hardly know her. She's your sister. Step-sister! I may have met her four times. Listen, I need to talk... She's so proud of you, she's bragging to all her friends about that Usher tour. I didn't even book that, why would... That's your father pulling up. I haven't even started dinner. Mom! I have to go. Love you, sweetie! Hey! There she is! I'll just get your Jane Hancock here. Okay... So... I guess I will leave you guys to it. Unless anyone wants anything? Water? You people are good for water? I'm good. Yeah. I'm good for water. Great. Okay. Have fun? You know you don't have to do this if you don't want to. If you need time to think about this... I have thought about it. Okay. And action! You're being too hard on yourself. He was only fourteen. We did everything we could. Did we? Still rolling... Let's get the menthol stick in here. Okay. I need the tears, man. Wes was very specific here, he needs you to cry. I'm sorry, I can do this. I don't need the menthol stick, I can do it. Obviously, you can't. We're already running over. I don't have time to hand-hold you through the next ten takes. Just use the stick. Can you please just- Pick it up! Ugh... Last couple of lines... And... action! You're being too hard on yourself. He was only fourteen... We did everything we could. Did we? Cut! Thank you! Every trick in the book! Okay, where are we going? Mortuary... how fitting. Moving on! + I'm not married. I mean, I don't know what this... oh, no, you mentioned that in the meeting. Right! Right. Yeah. Um, you have a daughter? Yes. She's fifteen. Oh no. Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. That's a terrible age for girls. It really is. She really, really hates talking to me right now. Well... The trick is to find silent activities to do together. You know, like watch movies. Yeah, I already figured that one out. We watch a lot of films. Oh, "films." Oh, well... Yes, I'm a bit of a cinema snob. I grew up watching the classics. The whole reason my mom came out here, she wanted to be the next grace Kelly. Hmm. How'd that go? Well, have you ever heard of Roberta Blackwood? No. That's how it went. Uhhh Ahhh, aye ahh, Midgets! Am I right? I've had it up to here with those guys. Because they're... Yeah, they're not laughing at my set, believe it or not. No, they're laughing because Meghan's telling them all how bad I am at sex. Uh, Meghan's the one who just stopped laughing. There she is. Hi, Meghan. Oh my God. We were doing it last night and she informs me that the only way she can have an orgasm is if I strangle her. And uh... Of course, I had heard of this before... and by heard, I mean seen on the Internet. So yes, I start choking. Okay, look, I'm not great at it. I'll admit it. What about me screams, "would be good at strangling"? I mean, if she was looking for someone to say... Watch "the notebook" with, while she talked about her boyfriend, I totally get that. But like, if you're casting your fantasy rapist, why not go all the way? Go get yourself a UFC Vin Diesel-looking dude... I'm thinking face tats and track marks... Why pick the guy who, let's be honest, looks like a malnourished James Franco? So I started strangling her... So when did you decide to become an actress? I dunno. I don't really ever remember not wanting it. I'm sure there was a princess phase in there at some point. I'm envious. I mean, you have something that you've always wanted, you're doing it. It's working. Yeah... No. Uh, it's not working. Basically, I just run around... auditions, meetings, changing outfits in the car...
