 Previously on "The L.A. Complex": I'm pregnant. Are we living together? Guess so. Listen, we're putting together a writing room for a new late night talk show. Hello, Sabrina. Comedy writing is a blood sport. You're trying to get in my head- yeah, and it's working. That should worry you.

 We're gonna hire both of you... You and Sabrina. Are you his sister or his agent? I'm whatever he needs me to be. I do think he's great. If you ever do find yourself in L.A. - Drop me a line. - Thanks. Oh my... Did your agent explain this character to you? She's married to God. You're a mess. I know I am. I'm tired of it. Be my girlfriend. - You don't even love me. - I do love you.

 Look at my face. Just tell me what I need to do? I never wanna see you again. Do something... do something... Do something... ♪ it takes a thousand miles ♪ ♪ To reach the stars tonight ♪ ♪ And you will find your dreams they come alive ♪ Simon. Simon. Simon. Fine. I'll just enjoy the view by myself. ♪ And you will find your dreams they come alive ♪ ♪ In the sun, when you're young ♪ ♪ In the sun, when you're young ♪ ♪ You find a way ♪ ♪ In the sun, when you're young ♪ ♪ In the sun, when you're young ♪ ♪ You find a way ♪ ♪ Back home ♪ If it's important, he'll call back. He has called back - three times. Hi, Ron. The Saying Grace people are just wondering where you are. Um, I read for them yesterday, Ron Did I not call you last night? No, you didn't. - You got the part! - What?! You shoot today! What time was my call?! Half an hour ago. You know, you're very cute when you're frenzied. Why can't I find my underwear?! Because I've been gradually throwing them out. My plan is nearly complete. Fine. I'll go commando. That's the plan. I got a part. I booked Saying Grace! That's great! Hey, that means we both start work today! I have to go, I'm late! Okay. Hey, have a wonderful first day. I'll also have a good first day. Thank you. Ah, new girl, new job, new Nick. Old Nick. ♪ The air is unbearably harmful tonight ♪ - Oh God! - Agghhhh! Oh, did I burn you?! Who cares! Look at my shirt! I don't have time to change! Listen, actually, I'm glad I saw you. I wanted to apologize for the other day in your room... This could be a look, right? People walk around like this all the time. Yeah, I guess they could. Okay, great. Thanks. Morning. Hey, are you okay? I'm not feeling so hot. What is all that? Sugar, right, with milk? Cream? Soy milk? What? I couldn't remember how you take your tea so I just got you four different options, just to be safe. I'm off caffeine. Why? I'm on a cleanse. Oh. Perfect. I did, however, successfully manage to bring you several breakfast options. What're you doing? You're acting very strange. Oh... Okay, um... Last night, I obviously had a few drinks. Last night, you had all the drinks. And I said a few things about us... As a... Maybe I wouldn't have said if I hadn't had all the drinks... Relax. It's not like you got drunk and joined the marines. I'm not gonna hold you to it. Well, see, that's just the thing. Now that it's morning and I'm sober- - I get it. - I don't feel any different. I still wanna be your boyfriend... If you still want me to be. I do. Yeah. Can you say that one more time? Eat your breakfast. I have to go. What? Why? I got a meeting with Jennifer Bell. Jennifer Bell? Are you gonna be in a Jennifer Bell movie now? I hate you. I hate me too. Wait? What kind of cleanse are you doing? None of your business. All right, so no pets, no noise after eleven, and no illegal activity, obviously. You, short stuff, you a bank robber? Jewel thief? You got any proof? No jewels. All right, your story checks out. Now, you can do rent on a week-to-week or you can do it monthly. I saw your sign outside for... For cleaning staff. I was wondering if I could trade my labour for a room? Yeah, if we quintupled the amount we pay our cleaning staff. Oh! Hey! Wait! What're you doing?! What're you doing?! Fixing the wires. What's the matter with you? You might wanna turn the breaker off first. - Oh, geez. - Simon... Hand me those cutters. Oh, I see what you mean though, this is brutal. Wrong grade of wire, no caps, no grounds... This is a total fire hazard. That's one of the ones I fixed already. You need an electrician. I kinda blew the budget already, mostly on drywall. They make it look so easy on YouTube. Where'd you learn how to do this stuff? Our dad's in construction. Look, I fix this? You give us a room. How about this room? - Deal. - All right. Good handshake. Yours could use some work. I bought you breakfast. Why? I thought we could bury the hatchet. Then you should've brought a hatchet. Look, I'm sorry you think I stole your bit. That is a terrible apology, and you did steal my bit. We were riffing! I couldn't remember who said what. I say the funny things, you say the stupid things. What's to remember? C'mon! You know that I feel bad about this. Look, we're the two baby writers in the room. It'll be better for both of us if we're a united front. You know it, and I know it. What do you say? Truce? That depends. Do you promise to stop using words like "truce"? You see this, this witty repartee we have? This is why we're so good together. We're like an old vaudeville duo. Mm-hm. Aren't I amazing? You can't even see my lips moving. At least try the danish. It's raisin. You've never been in a writers room before, have you? Are you kidding? Writers room is to me what ocean is to shark. I'm gonna own this place. Fine. Whatever. Truce. Look, Nick, danishes! Hey, look who's awake. How you feelin'? What were you thinkin', man? You scared me, man. Whatever. You're back now and that's all that matters. Hey, hey. Everything's gonna be okay. We gonna make this like this never even happened, all right? Now listen to me, the only other hoops we gotta jump through is this test the doctor's gonna give you. I leaned on the cat that's gonna give you the test and he gave me the down-low. So all you gotta do is everything they ask you, just say "no." What are these questions? What'd I just say? Doesn't matter what. The answer's no. 'Sup, doc? Would now be an okay time to ask Mr. King a few questions? Yeah. Sure. Pull up a chair. Would you mind excusing us? Yeah. Sure. Got some calls to make, so... I apologize for the bluntness of some of these questions. We need this psychiatric evaluation on file before we can legally discharge you. Okay. Question one: Do you continue to have any thoughts that you would characterize as suicidal? Yes. If released, can you imagine ever trying to take your own life again? Yes. Do you have access to lethal means? Yes. Are you distressed that your attempt to end your life failed? Yes. Hi, I'm Abby Vargas. You're late. Yes, I know, because my agent- Donald wants to see you in his office. Hi, Donald! I'm here. You wanted to see me? Oh! Whoa! Yeah. I didn't mean to uh... Catch you in the middle of changing, or-? Oh, no, this is a top. It's from American Apparel. They call it the bra top. Yes. Well, as star, director, and executive-producer, I like to meet all our guests and make sure they're comfortable. Thank God! I thought I was in trouble. Yeah, you auditioned for the role of Maria, the student missionary, but around here I think we all believe you'd be better suited for Veronica, the promiscuous new girl. Well, it's nice of you to think of me. This is a family show, family values. Our fans would tolerate nothing less. I thought christians were supposed to be tolerant. This is our standard morality clause, which stipulates that, while under contract, your behavior will be in strict adherence to the show's core values. Right. Absolutely. And that not only will you be vigilant with yourself, but also your co-workers. You'll report any infractions. Like narc on people? I prefer to see it as the buddy system. Your arc is two episodes at the moment. It could be less, it could be more. It all depends on how you fit. You think you'll be a good fit, Abby? I think I'm gonna be a perfect fit. That is great, that is great. Sabrina is on fire! Okay. Anybody else have anything along that vein? Anyone? Not all at once. Nobody? Okay, let's take a break. I love this. I mean, everyone's just collaborating, and spitballing, and then you with the- you need to say something. - What? I've said stuff, haven't I? - No! Laughing and listening sounds is not contributing. You say you're a shark. Well, sharks need to swim, or they will not be asked back next season. Well, people need to be listened to. And besides, I'm just figuring out the feel of the room, you know, waiting for the right moment. The right moment is always now. Nick, stop it! Nobody eats danishes. Danishes make you look stupid. You make me feel stupid; that's not helpful. Fine. Talk to me, goose. I have a straight offer for you. No! For Cactibear 2. Ugh. No. It's a movie. It's a tv movie about a half-bear/half-cactus who kills base jumpers. Fine. I also got you in to read for that feature you've been bugging me about. "Falling Parallel." For the lead? No, the snarky sister. Well, no, I'm perfect for the lead. Well, they don't see you that way. See me what way? You know... nice, relatable, warm. Hey, I am plenty warm! Not according to the casting directors I've talked to. I know a guy who teaches a class... You did not just say that to me. It's not about acting. We all know you can act. It's about learning how you're perceived and using it. Well, it sounds stupid. He has a class this afternoon, and I said you'd stop by. Look, you can bitch to me or you can do something about it, but we're running out of casting directors. ♪ All my kin are spinning tops ♪ ♪ Bearing wounds and aftershock ♪ ♪ I don't know what I'm doing here ♪ Thank you. Hey. Ditching me already? Oh... hi! Uh, no, I'm sorry, I thought maybe there'd been some sort of mix-up. Well, I'm fifteen minutes late. Do you give up that easy? Uh... Uh, I'm here now. Do you wanna do this, or...? Yes! Absolutely. So my agent said that you wanted to meet? Yeah. Well, I'm meeting with a few people, trying to find the right fit. I'm Jen, by the way. Uh, Connor. Sorry. So tell me about this movie. Now, who said anything about a movie? Oh, I must've misunderstood. If you don't wanna talk about the project, then I don't know why I'm here. Well, buy me a smoothie and maybe you'll find out. Hey! Hi! Simon, stand up. What uh... What are you doing here? Uh, well, you said if we were ever in town, that we should look you up, and... And here we are! Uh... great. Yeah. You said Simon could do well down here. Absolutely. No, I mean... We're not casting right now, but just leave your agent's information, right? He doesn't have an agent. Well, he should get one. Right. I sort of thought you could maybe help us with that. Right! You... Okay, hang on. Um... Okay. Yeah. I think these guys are great... Maybe. Uh, okay. Is there someone specific I should ask for, or...? Yeah, yeah. I mean... Uh, yup, that number right there. Just contact them. I'm sure they'll put you in touch with the right person. Should I give them your name? Sure. Okay. I mean, you can, yeah. Look, you gave me your card, you said that you would help us if we ever came down. Well, we're down, so are you gonna help us or not? I gave you my card because I was hitting on you. I'm eighteen. Yeah, I don't really have- look, I'm not in a position to help you. I'm sorry. Go get 'em, bud. He's not gonna help us? I think he just did. Lord Jesus Christ, please watch over us as we try to make our humble show in your name. Amen. Amen. Knock 'em dead, sis. You've got this. You too, bro. Thank you. All right, people, let's go save some souls! Woo! Saving souls... Love doing that. Amen. Come with me for a sec, hon. Did you change your wardrobe? No. Well, I have my own bra on, because the other one was kinda grandma-ish. Yeah, Donald has a problem with your look. He just signed off on this fifteen minutes ago. Yeah, well, apparently it was warmer then, so... I'm sorry, I don't... They're for your nipples. You can see your nipples through your top. Yeah, Donald doesn't like nipples. Oh my God. Donald also doesn't like when you take the Lord's name in vain. Don't worry, I gotta wear 'em too. My nipples get crazy hard. I'm Brandon, by the way. I play grace's brother. I'm Abby. I play the slut. Nice. Anyone have a twenty on Brandon? - Ahem. - Okay. Come find me later, I'll show you around. We're not as crazy as we seem. Well, Donald is. He's insane. You should... Yes. Tell me a secret. A secret? Yeah. Breeds familiarity. Cuts past all the boring stuff. I burned my house down two days ago. On purpose or by accident? Uh, the show sent me a photograph of my face, some promo shot... Yeah, those things are awful. I felt like burning it. The rest sort of... kinda progressed from there. Wait, you're serious. Wow! That's a good secret. Okay. You're turn. Me? No. Um... I don't know... Plastic surgery? No? I don't really think I can compete with house-burning. Come on. Okay, what scares you? Disappearing. That's a cop-out. Everyone's scared of disappearing. Thanks for seeing us so quick. I always have time for a possible client. Simon's a good kid. He's respectful, he listens... He's a hard worker. You know what? I'm gonna stop you. I see a lot of kids. Right, but this director said that- And I've gotten pretty good at seeing who has the potential to work and who doesn't... And I think Simon can work. So if you two are amenable, I'd like to sign him to a six month contract. - For real?! - Damn right we're amenable! Sorry, uh, what's this section here, the "start-up" package? Yeah. That's standard. That's everything we need to get Simon up and running. Headshots, acting classes... Simon, stop! Admin charges... I teach the classes twice a week, and we have our own in-house photographer. This says $1200 dollars. Our rates are very competitive. Is that gonna be a problem? No. No problem. Okay. Fine. Tell me about the movie. It's a love story. Between me and you? Between me and someone. It could be you, it could be Ryan Gosling. The jury's still out. I've never done a movie before. I know. You've never done much of anything before. And yet, you're the star of your own tv series. How does that happen? I don't know. Can I try something? Sure. I'm-I'm sorry. All right, let's do this. - Do what? - Come on. Brandon? Yes! Is now a good time to- Get out! Get out! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Kaldrick, you wanna share anything? Share? Yeah. Tell us something; it's what group is for. No, thank you. Hey, there's no judgment here. Don't touch me, man! What the hell is wrong with you? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Okay, okay. You don't like being touched. Now we all know that. Please, have a seat. Okay. John, you wanna share today? Yeah, sure I just, you know, I wanna line up a bunch of good days, you know? Like a whole week in a row. Yo, you got a problem? What the hell you lookin' at? Kaldrick! Kaldrick! What the hell you lookin' at? Kaldrick! This don't concern you. And it doesn't concern him, either, okay? He just stands there, day in and day out, staring at that same spot on the wall. You're in his spot, okay? Look at him. They call him the abyss. He's harmless. He hasn't spoken in years. Can we continue? Okay, John, sorry, you were saying? I just, you know, I just wanna line up a bunch of good days. You know? Like a whole week in a row. Hey, how's the typing pool shaping up? Well, judging by your subtle body language and the continued presence of this young man, I'm gonna say not so good. Hey, Paul, good to see you again. What are we working on, hive-mind? Trying to find a way to end the first episode that sets us "apart." Ugh! Why don't we try "be good"? I was hoping for something a little more specific. Oh, uh, whaaaat about... Okay, this is probably stupid, but... What if the very last thing we do is, Paul says to the audience, "good audience-" you're being me now? - Yeah. - Careful... Okay. Uh, "good audience", before we send you back out into that cold, lonely world, we'd like to make sure that each and every one of you "gets a hug." And then you... You hug the audience. Yeah, and not just Paul, like the entire staff comes out and hugs each member of the audience, while you sing "Danny boy" or something. It is stupid, isn't it? It's not great. How about this, weirdly enough I don't hate it! I kinda hate the person who said it- why do you hate me? But I don't hate "it." Somewhere underneath the sheer thoughtlessness, the borderline stupid naivete, it almost touches on something that's really kind of brilliant... Even by accident. So nice work, Rick. Nick. And Mrs. Rick. Okay, guys, fisherman sketch, let's finish that one. Hi! Have a seat, Connor. This is a confidentiality agreement. What's the film? Sign it and we'll tell you. - What's the film? - There is no film. Okay. Well, I can't do another tv series- it's not a series either. What, do you want me to do theater? I want you to go out with me. - You what?-? - I wanna hire you to be my boyfriend. You wanna hire me to be your boyfriend? For six months. With an option for six more. This is... A serious offer, which you should seriously consider. Why? Do I really have to explain? Yeah. Yeah, you do. How old do you think I am? - I don't know- - Don't answer that. It turns out 18-year-old kids don't know who I am anymore. If I don't do something drastic, I'm gonna fall down a very deep hole that most actresses in this town never climb out of. I walk down the street with you, I stop disappearing. You make me relevant. What do you make me, aside from a prostitute? I make you a movie star. And this isn't about sex. You spend six months with me, you'll be on the cover of every trashy magazine in the world. You'll be famous enough to headline your own films. People really do this? All the time. - You lied to me. - No. I thought that we were having a real conversation back there. We were; that's why you're here. And you're upset. Yeah, I'm upset. That's okay. While you're upset, think about it. Don't forget about your confidentiality agreement. Don't worry, this meeting was twice as humiliating for me as it was for you. What else do we see? Who is this girl? She's sexy. I'd buy her as a spy. Yes. I also see a defense attorney. Young doctor maybe. What else? Porn star. Porn star? Okay. What else? We trust her? Yes, that's exactly it, we trust her, and that is money in the bank. All right, let's give our sexy spy-doctor a hand. So those are you archetypes - learn them, own them. Casting directors will love you for it. Okay, new girl, you're up. So who's this woman? She could definitely play a bitch. Okay, you know what- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Relax. This isn't about judgment or who you are. This is just what people see. So what else? What do we see? Anger. Tough. She's scary. Yes! I also see a corrupt senator in there... - Coroner, maybe... - What else? Calculating, jaded... Guarded, cynical, cold. What the hell do you know? If you're so smart, how come I've never seen you in anything? Okay, let's just try to stay open and receptive to- This room has the collective insight of a fortune cookie. You want to know what my archetype is? Working actress. That's what people see when I walk into a room. Class. You know I can't tell anyone anything you say in here, right? No matter how famous you are, it's confidential. I'm not allowed to say anything- I know what confidential means. Okay. So why are you here? Didn't have a choice, did I? Look, you don't wanna talk to me, that's fine. But you need to talk to someone. Otherwise, whatever drove you in here, it's gonna kill you. It almost did already, right? Just say it out loud. It'll help. Are we done? Raquel Westbrook? Nope. Guess she's a no-show. I'm here. Raquel? Hi! You look... I've never... Are you reading for the role of Doris? Actually, I was hoping to read for Heather if that's all right with you guys. Sure. I do my speech, talk, talk, talk... Brandon - then you noogie your sister, I exit, then... "Must be nice having a big brother." "Nope. It's the best." Just like that. All right, I need twenty minutes to light, - and one minute with you, Brandon. - Yeah. Abby, can I ask you something about that scene super-quick? Sure. I will murder you, do you understand me? If you tell Donald or anybody else about Brandon and me, I will slit your throat. Got it? Yeah, yeah. I get it. Good. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Um... so... Me and Laura and some other people are going out later - - Why don't you come with us? - No, no. I don't think Laura really- She's fine. Come out with us. - No. No. - You should come out with us. - No. - You should come out with us. Okay. Okay. What? Just admit it, we make a good team. Yeah. Kinda like a horse and a jockey. Exactly. You're the short one, so you know that makes you the jockey, right? Are you fighting to be the horse? The strong one? The actual winner of the race? Wha? What are you doing? I'm kissing you. You just said we made a good team, so I thought we could try another sport. No, sorry, I'm... I'm with Abby. Abby. Really? Yeah. We're living together. Nick, Sabrina, I am glad I caught you guys. Hey, listen, there's been a bit of confusion with your deals. In what sense? In the sense that you don't have any yet. Grrr. Yeah, production can't afford both of you, so I'm just gonna try you both out and whoever's not funny enough, I'll just fire. Yeah. Kind of sad when I say it out loud. Anyways, have a good night. Yeah. Great night. - The truce is off, isn't it? - Yeah. You are a dead man, Wagner. Bye, Dawn! Have a good night. Bye, Dawn! You sure you can't stay for one more? Actually, I should probably go with her because I have an early call time- Yeah, so do we. You should stay. - We need to talk. - Talk about what? I don't know what you're talking about. Because I didn't see anything because there's nothing to see, and also, I'm not a rat so... Here's the thing. We've been doing this show for six years- Playing Christian America's favourite brother and sister. Only somewhere in year three we accidentally fell in love- No, somewhere in the first read-through we accidentally fell in love. Somewhere in year three we got the balls to do something about it. Pretty much. Does anybody know? My mom, gay Patrick in makeup, and you. Patrick is gay?! I know this seems a little bit extreme, but you need to understand, Donald- is a psychopath. If he finds out the Donovan twins are banging each other... We're done. Okay? We're done. So... How are you at keeping secrets? My lips are sealed. Shake on it? Yes. Oh, hey... Uh, sorry. I don't know if you're picking up these messages or not, but um... We're actually down in L.A. now. It's a long story, but Simon's kinda trying to be an actor now, and he's actually not bad. Um, but the thing is... We need twelve hundred dollars to get him started and... I don't know if you've found a job out there yet or not, but um... But I could really use your help, dad. So, um, bye. Yeah, the wiring's pretty bad back there. Simon? Simon! Simon! Simon, what are you doing? Simon, get away from them! What the hell do you think you're doing? Sorry, we didn't- We're just making a short film about the Lux, and asking Simon what he thought of it so far. You told a stranger your name? No. You were just screaming it a bunch. This is Dita, Kevin, and Cam. They make movies! Cam says they can do my headshot for free! They're gonna help us, Beth. They did mine. They're really good. I mean, only if you want us to. Sorry. Did you hear anything back yet? They passed. What? No! I was charming, I was warm, I was sexy, I was nice, I- They passed, Raquel. They said your read came across as cold. But they love the new hair. Great. Well, then what about the other part? The bitchy sister. They cast it. What about Cactibear? We passed on that, remember? Well, can we unpass? Are you-Just do it. How was your day? I don't wanna talk about it. How was your day? I can't talk about it. Hello? Abby? Is that mortal combat? Are you actually at an arcade? I can't hear you, I'm at an arcade! I'm just having a drink with some of the cast! Well, I'm glad you had a good first day. Uh, I... I can't hear you. Can we talk later? I can't talk later. I have to be up early, so I have to go to bed now. Can we... can we... Can we talk for a minute? Great! I'll be home in a bit! I just really need these people to like me, and trust me. Can you go outside or something? I'd really like to talk to you. Okay, bye! Abby, come on! Turned down my first gig as a male escort and now I just broke my first confidentiality agreement, so... Don't tell anyone because I will get sued. I think you should do it. I'm serious. - No, you're not. - Yeah, I am. It's an opportunity, and those don't come along very often. They certainly don't for me anymore. What about... this morning? This morning was this morning, and tonight is tonight, and we've both had a helluva day in between. So you didn't really mean what you said then about wanting to... To be with me? Hey, hey, hey! Of course I wanna be with you. - Then why are you-? - Look, I don't like it. But it's six months that could change your life forever. Look, there are worse roles. Cactibear 2, for instance. You tell me who the whore is. Well, I think, technically, when you get to your level you're considered a call girl. You really think that I should do this? It's the smart move. Jennifer bell can have the fake you. I get the real one. Your eyelashes, they're... they're fake. - And these? - Padded. I have new nails too. You like 'em? They're really good. Yeah. We should lose this. We can't stay, Simon. Why? It was a mistake; we shouldn't have come down here in the first place. But we need the money! It's gonna cost us more than you could ever make. Beth, please, I can do this. I want to stay. All right, here's the deal: You don't leave my sight. Ever. It was just Kevin and Cam and Dita. They're nice. Yeah, everyone's nice until they're not. You pull that again, and we're gone. Two, this place, it doesn't change us. If I get a whiff that it is, then we're outta here. And three, if I get a bad feeling about anything, we walk. And if you get a bad feeling about anything, we walk. - Okay? - Deal. Does that mean we're staying? For now. But if you start sending me out for double-foam lattes or something, then we're outta here. What's a double-foam latte? Exactly. Love you, buddy. What you doin', man? You ain't supposed to be in here. Neither are you. Single dropped. What? "Hard times." Radio's all over it. It got leaked. I can't leave. I'm here now until the doctors say I'm better. That's it, it's done. Naw, man, I took care of it. You're good to go. Ain't nothin' that's done that I can't undo for you. All right? Right. Here. Get dressed. Let's get outta here, this place gives me the creeps. Come on, man, let's go. I'll meet you outside. Give me two seconds. Go! I'm a faggot.
