 Previously on The "L.A. Complex": So if we're gonna do this, we gotta plays this close to the vest. You scare me, and you know why. Thank you, but you won't be moving on today. Alicia, would you consider making a sex tape with me? You'd be hard-pressed to find a sex tape out there that hasn't raised the stock of both parties involved. I just walked your script into the biggest agency in town. We don't think you're a fit for this agency anymore.

 What? I'm late for A.A. A.A.? I just go for the networking. I have a really great script. Can I read it? I don't have time to hand-hold you through the next ten takes. I got a good old friend of mine, I'm gonna bring him in to work with you. What, like an acting coach? He's a bit of a miracle worker. Um, remember those pills I gave you? Did you sell them by any chance?

 Yeah. Mom? I can't stay here anymore... Okay, sweetie? Why don't you go back to bed? Your brother can take care of himself and... I have to take care of Charlotte. I can't... I'll come back for you, I promise. But for now you have to stay with your daddy, okay? But he hates me. No... You be good, Connor. Sync and corrected by dr. jackson for Come in! Hey, Connor. Sorry, I was gonna wait till you were finished working out, My name's Paul. I've heard a lot of good things about you. Oh, yeah? From who? Well, from producers, from everybody. God, they all love you. Everybody loves everybody. Okay... I'm ready. For what? You're my acting coach, right? The producers hired you? - Yes. - Okay. I got a big scene today, so... let's do it. Listen, Connor, I don't really know what I'm doing here, do you? Look, this is um... It's my first real acting job so I think the network is just a little... This is a nice trailer. Yeah. Um... There's lots of medical terminology and I think that I'm just... really focused on the accent. Is that fifty inches? Oh man, this is a nice TV. Look at that. Sorry, um... What were you saying? Why am I here? I think, I think that... Connor, why am I here? Because I'm not good enough. Let's go for a walk. You nervous? No. Yes. Depends - how do I look? Cute. Cute? Really cute? What? That's worse? Uh, cool. You look cool. Well, you don't wanna look cool, you wanna be cool. If you look cool, then you're a try-hard and it ruins the whole thing. Why would they not want you to try hard? Isn't that kinda what auditions are? You wanna look like you want it the least. Okay, how 'bout you're hot, you're like dirty-hot. Dashing? You're a handsome woman who... Okay. Look, I think you're cool and cute and hot and beautiful. Wish me luck? Good luck. Oh... Oh... Yeah, the phone. Bye. Bye. I should probably go for a jog. Oh my God! Oh my God! I didn't really look at it, if that means anything. I don't believe it! We'll call a lawyer, and we'll get it taken down. That is such a terrible angle. What? I mean, look at it. They're trying to get people to buy this tape. Maybe use shots that didn't look like I had a Turkey neck. Wait... You knew about this? Yeah, I just... I didn't know it would be coming out so soon. Why? W-W-When did you- what? Why? Rick asked me, and well... I like him and I trust him. Plus, name one person who didn't benefit from a sex tape. But look at this, this is the best part. "Identified as Los Angeles stripper Alicia Lowe." They know who I am. You're a stripper?! You're missing the point. This is gonna open a lot of doors for me. What doors? Don't go in those doors! Oh, I'm gonna be late for my audition, so... Thanks so much for bringing it by. It's so exciting! Yeah... Congratulations. Man, it's our first day off in weeks! We'll play some Naruto, smoke some Polm, sip some Krug. Yeah, I have no idea what any of that is, but it all sounds great. Whoa, whoa, whoa... You don't know Naruto? See, you're gonna have to educate me. Here it is. Or... apres vous. Huh? What, I say it wrong? This is it? What were you expecting? I said I was goin' to my downlow, this is what a downlow looks like. It's nicer on the inside. There's a PS3, there's a couch... What, the list stops after "couch"? I just wanted to go somewhere private. No phone calls, none of my boys droppin' by... In there, it's just you and me. So all it has to be is private. Why? You trust me? Dude, is that... Yeah. - Like, a real one? - I think it is, man. Dude, how much do you think he's worth... Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Do not talk about money, okay? Talk about the script, your vision, how you went to film school... Don't talk about money. I'm still working him. "Working him?" What? We got it, no money stuff. Okay, guys. Here you go. So I loved your script. Raquel told me it was great and she was right. You guys are certainly very talented, as writers. Well, they're even better filmmakers. Yeah, we've got a DVD of all our short films for you to check out. There's about six on there. Six, wow. I had no idea you guys were that experienced. Well, they're made with, like, no money, whereas the budget of this film... Just like the Coen brothers - writers and directors. Nice. Well, maybe this'll be your "blood simple." - That is a classic movie. - Great movie. And made with no stars, just good actors, and a good script. And... I think it only cost like a million dollars to make... Gary has a poster of Fargo up at his house. Yeah, I love movies. So... uh... What're we thinking here, a couple hundred grand? In seed money, to get this thing started, yeah. And the odds of me getting that back aren't very good, are they? If everything goes perfect, then um... We win some awards, get some buzz, make a sale, everybody wins. Ultimately, this isn't a business decision. It's an investment in people. Thank you! 215, 232, 224, and 210, stick around. Everybody else, thank you! Uh, wait. 219, come here for a sec. Tony, you scared me for a second. This is a willow Smith video. Oh! You want me to take this out? More whipping? Look, you know I'm a big fan, but uh... There are other factors that come into play here and I've gotta let you go. Other factors? And what's that code for today? What, I'm not hot enough? No. I'm too old? No-well, yes, but no. What, somebody knows the director? That's it, right? Or the producer? Come on, Tony, I'm tired of losing gigs to girls who don't play by the rules. I am better than every single... Look, you make a sex tape, and you can't be in a music video for tweens. Did you forget about that rule? Maybe you'll have somebody next week or... Yeah. Okay, next group, get ready. + Are you outta your mind? Look, you wanted to get away from everyone. And what're we supposed to do here? We're supposed to relax, look at the view, go for walks... Look, I hear they make great crepes. And who's making these crepes?? The couple who run the place. 'Kay, Kal! Who else is in there? It's just us and them. Well, that's two damn too many. Kal, we drove five hours to get here... I said private. This ain't private! Trust me when I say they're not gonna know who you are. What? Everybody knows who I am. Well, hello there! Hi. We're the ones who called? Yes! Carl Winslow, right? And Steve, was it? Actually, I'm Carl, he's Steve. Oh, well it's great to meet you both. Come on in, we'll get you all settled. You actually might recognize Steve here. He's a musician. Oh, really? Have you stayed with us before? No. Come on in. Apres vous. Thank you so much. Well, how'd the audition go? Okay, was the director nice at least? The director wasn't even there. It was just an assistant with a camera. Well, that's good... That nobody important was there to... Okay, you just wanna go home? Please. You know what? We're gonna do something else, something fun. I have no money. Exactly. I'm gonna show you how to live in L.A. For two bucks a day. Are you gonna take me to jollibee again? No fast food! Look, you teach a man to fish with food... I've messed this up. You get what I'm saying. I do. You're going to feed me. No, I'm going to teach you to feed yourself, lotus flower. One doesn't fully blosso... Okay. Oh, yup. Okay. Congratulations. Meaning? Meaning those two weirdos you vouched for actually appear to be quite capable. Oh, okay, so I'm not an idiot. Right. Congratulations. So just to be clear, does this mean what I... Sorry. Uh, I'm just running in. Lauren left her backpack. I didn't think that uh... What're you doing home? I left work early. Uh, Jennifer, this is Raquel. Raquel, this is Jennifer. Hi. Hello. So, um she said by the door, but it's not. Do you know where... I'll get it. So... Rachel, is it? Raquel. And what do you do? I'm an actress. Ah... Has he promised you anything yet? I'm sorry? Has he promised you anything? It's not like that. Be careful if he does. Well, I'm not asking him for anything, so... You really are an actress. Got it! You ladies talking about me? Oh... mmm! Oh man, it's the moistness that gets ya. So good! Have one. - No, thanks. - Mm. You're more of an oreo man. No, I'm-I just... What, you're undeserving of cookies? Let me ask you something: How'd you even get this job if you're so... What did you say? You said you're... You're not good enough? Auditions are different. Even terrible actors get lucky... Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're terrible now? Wow. A couple seconds ago, I thought you were just not good enough. But didn't you have, like, three callbacks? Eight. Wow, that's a lot of lucky auditions. Excuse me, sir, what's your name? Callum. Callum, you got a second? Mm-hmm. Can you just, um, - right there... Can you read Connor's part? I'll start. "How is she?" "Your sister had a small pulmonary embolism" that got trapped in her lunges and blocked the oxygen supply. "I've put her on blood thinners so-" this is a terrible actor. N-nothing personal. I mean, I'm sure you're a fantastic grip. I have seen your audition tapes, okay? All eight of them. You are not this guy. You're good. I was relaxed in the audition. Okay, why? Because I didn't think that I would get it. Of course you're not gonna get it. I mean everyone in town went out for this thing. Why would you get it? Right. Right. They're not gonna give this to some guy who's never worked before. Exactly! I don't know why... But they did. So maybe you're good. I mean, I dunno, seems like the simplest explanation, don't you think? Come on, you're good, they like you, and there are cookies. I'm actually trying to get some representation. That's great. Good luck to you. It's a great day for a walk. I got allergies. Oh, we've been working a lot, so I think we're just gonna relax. So you been busy in the recording studio? What you say? Well, Carl said you were a musician. Uh, you know, I play the ukulele, so if you ever wanna, you know, jam... You know, Carl, can I talk to you for one second? Look, you said you'd try. You got the Internet? You bet! Dial-up. So no games. No, we have plenty of games. Yahtzee, scrabble, battleship... You know what? I'm good. No. C'mon, man! That's a triple word score! I'm not familiar with "sheazy." That's not even new! How old is that dictionary?! - It's slang- - No it's not! Fo sheazy - that would be slang. Oh, I'm glad you're just having a good ol' time! Hey! Alicia! Great to see you! I love this! It's like flashdance in Los Feliz. I just came from an audition. Well, it feels very authentic. What's going on with the tape sale, Gavin. All right, look, here's the thing. We're not going to sell it. You're... Ricky would kill me for spoiling the surprise, but... He just got cast on the next season of rehab, which is very exciting for us, you know. It's a nice payday, great exposure... Also, probably save his life, so... - I didn't know... - Yeah, he's been high this whole time. Really, really sad. But now we have an opportunity to put him back on the radar in a more positive way. So that whole sex tape thing... Kinda counter-productive at this point, which is unfortunate... for you... From a financial standpoint. And some other standpoints, I guess. You don't understand, I can't book dance gigs. I've been making calls; Sweat, Fusion, Metro, Livid... These are club names from across the country. We're talking appearance fees, all right? 'Cause now they have a name that they can put on their flyer. "Alicia Lowe, Ricky Lloyd's sexcat! Thursday night at... Crystal." Really?! That's amazing! So far no one's called, which is unfortunate... for you. + We're casing scores? Are we what? Like, cat burglaring? 'Cause I didn't bring my glass cutter thingie or my suction cup thingie. Here we go! One man's trash is another man's recycled... Please stop with the fortune cookies. We're stealing bottles, all right? You'd be surprised how much money you can make off these. Is it more than a nickel? No. No, it's a nickel. But don't knock it. How is this gonna get me fed? Oh, all in good time, grasshopper. Now you're just being racist. Fair enough. Ungh! You gotta focus. How is this an acting exercise? It's not. But I thought you said... Agh! I told you that F. Murray Abraham taught me how to do it. It's called Indian hot hands. Come on. Now it's your turn. Okay. Hands on the hips. Focus. Agh! I just gotta go take a piss. I'll be right back. Control your temper and stop yelling. Don't tell me how to do my job, Paul. The kid wasn't getting it! The kid was trying to cry while you're yelling at him! How's that supposed to work? Tough love, Paul. He's either gonna get it from me... Tough love? What does that mean? Come on. Maybe you weren't getting your day, you were stressed and you took it out on the kid. Hmm? Maybe that's what happened? - Maybe. - Maybe. Okay, don't talk to the kid like that again - ever. Okay. - Okay? - Okay. How's he doin', anyway? I like him. It's in the bar. We need it to be outside. No, but I need it to be... He in? He's gonna watch the DVD's. So, no. Not yet, but... Uh-huh. What does that mean, "uh-huh"? C'mon. We're never gonna see a dime from this guy. He's perfect, okay? He's rich and bored with his life, and wants to get into movies. And your pants. What if he's the one working you? All right, listen, momos, I'm having dinner with him tonight, and I have a plan. I'm gonna close it, you're gonna make your movie, I'm gonna be in it and it's gonna be awesome. Mm-hmm. This is amazing! If I had more than a pocketful of nickels, I'd buy this whole place. The Abby Vargas story. So what do you usually get? Ah! This: Um, actually, I changed my mind. I really wanna go to the jollibee and get some French fries. No. Half a pound of this, please. Money. Trust me. Excellent. Give it to her. Oh, me. Okay. Yeah, that's for you. Thank you. No bun? We're taking it to go. Ew! Oh, she will. It's just a matter of time. It's inevitable. Oh, here it comes. Oh! Damn it! Did I tell you? How did you see that? - There you go. - Thank you, sir. Connor, we need you for blocking. Oh. All right, buddy. It's been great meeting you. But we haven't done any work on the scene or anything... The what? I've got this big scene today. I've been working on it since yesterday. Is that the one where you play a doctor? What? Come on. The network, the producers... There are like a hundred people that chose you for this thing, and you may not think you know what you're doing, but they sure do. Connor, we need you. Now look, this might be an L.A. thing to say, but everybody loves you. - But... - All right, c'mon! You can do this. Okay, okay! Coming! Oh, hey! Tell me your manager is crazy. My manager is crazy. So the sale is on? Oh, oh... I see what you're saying. No. No... You know what? Let me get you some soup, okay? Come on. How could you do this to me? Well, now, wait a minute, I did not do this to you. User-Ricky did this to you, okay? I don't know if Gavin told you, but I got a role on the next season of rehab. Yeah, I know. And it's not a "role." Still... I beat out a lot of people. You need to give me money, and a lot of it. I know, but all my money's wrapped up in investments right now... Also I don't have any, so... Drugs kinda cost a lot of money. This is not my place. You lied to me. Hey. No, I did not. I-I meant everything that I said to you. Look, I've been around a long time, and, you know, one day you can be broke and squatting in Bruce Greenwood's loft, the next minute you could be cast in some celebrity rehab style show. It happens all the time. Look, your opportunity will come. This looks amazing, Carol. It's all home grown, organic. Ted picked it out of the garden this morning. I'm guessing Ted didn't pick any veal out there. All vegan, man. Mm-hmm. So... How long you guys been together? You know, our daughter, she just got married in New York to a lovely woman. Oh, it was beautiful. They're very much like you two: They're different, but I don't know... Somehow it all... Seems to make sense. So how long have you been together? Well... It depends on what you mean by "together." You see, I'm not the only one who has trouble with this. This sweet girl says we've been together since our first date. Mm-hmm. And this one says it's the first time that we... I was all in after that, man. So, Steve, come on, how long? Well, we met about three weeks ago. Oh! And when did you first, uh... Ted! About three weeks ago. A man who knows what he likes! But the question is... Who made the first move? That's sweet. That's sweet. + So when you said you'd teach a man to fish, you meant literally. Oh, was that not clear? So now we wait? Yeah. Hmm. What? After robbing Beverly Hills mansions and crazy Asian fish market, it's kind of anti-climactic. Are you serious? I thought today was pretty amazing. It's just all I can think about is another day went by and my phone didn't ring. Okay, you can't just not enjoy stuff. Your phone will ring when it rings. You can let it go, as long as you keep believing that if you just wait long enough... Things just might happen... when you least expect it, something amazing just... I really wanted a fish to bite during that to prove my point and... It missed its cue. Totally. Hey, did you watch that DVD by any chance? Which DVD? The DVD... Cam and Kevin... The shorts. You said you were gonna watch it and then decide. Yeah. Yeah. No, I did. They really moved the, uh... Yeah, those guys are gonna blow up. I know a lot of people say that about a lot of people but... Listen, I'm sorry about Jennifer. No, it... Anything she said about me... Is true. But I was drinking then. I did things, I was unfair, and I am not that guy anymore. When you say "things"... There he is! Hey, doc! What's up? Raquel, I want you to meet someone. Navid Cooper. Hello. I'm a huge fan. I mean, of teenage wasteland obviously, but I also love your newer stuff. What newer stuff? Your guest spot on NCIS, your arc on Smallville, you're great and I think you should be working more. I'm with William Morris endeavor. Navid was by the office today, and I mentioned... And he told me you're looking for a new agent, and I thought I'd throw my hat in the ring. Now, no pressure. I'm sure you're getting plenty of attention right now. Yeah, well, yeah. Mm-hmm. I wanted to come here in person, and show you just how excited I am. I've done that, and now I wanna leave you guys to your dinner. It was great meeting you. Yes... y-yes. Navid, thank you so much for coming by. Are you kidding, doc? It's my pleasure. All right, man. Have a good night. Good night. I tried to get a meeting with WME, and they said they weren't taking any new clients. Oh, they're not. But Navid's a patient of mine, so he made an exception. Now, about that DVD... Which DVD? So they both wore wedding gowns? I always wondered about that. Oh, they were beautiful. Yeah, they're hot. Thank you. Where's this? Oh, that's the gold coast in Australia. You guys ever been? No. What is that?! It's weed. Is that... sorry. No, no, it's fine. Yeah, yeah, it's hella fine. Let me hit that. Big Ted comin' through. You know what's even more gorgeous than Australia? Brazil. That's the Iguazu. Have you ever been? Mm-mm. How 'bout Bali? Nope. Hawaii? Nope. Not even Hawaii? Man, you guys haven't been anywhere, have you?! I've been to all those places... Just not with anyone. Well, you guys came all the way out to big sur, you just... you gotta keep going, start your own scrapbook. Oh lord... - Ted! - Yeah! Time for bed. Hey! You want this back? Oh no, you keep it, we're... We're good. You guys help yourself to another bottle of wine if you'd like. Good night. - Thanks for everything. - Appreciate it. It was amazing! Like, they applauded. I didn't know that people even did that on a set. I just... I just want to thank you, you know? Well, I didn't do anything. Literally, I did nothing. It was all you. No. No, it wasn't. I need to work with you, like, all the time. Well, uh, I have a workshop every other Sunday... What? No. No, full-time. Like all the time. Oh, no... I do a little bit of coaching when they call me in, but... no, I teach at UCLA. I have full-time students. Okay, I'm not good at negotiations, so you just tell me what you want and that's fine. Who's this? Oh, this is uh... A guy I worked with today, sweetie. Sorry, Connor, you got me in the middle of games night. Oh, sorry. I... No, no, no. It's no problem, um... Thanks for stopping by. I... I'm not sure how... You have my email, right? Email's easier. Yeah. You know, I'll see you around soon. See you on the TV! And you know what? You did a good job today. All right. Good night. Gary, let's just get business out of the way. What is that? It's your birthday, isn't it? I don't tell anybody it's my birthday. How'd you know it was my birthday? Imdb. Ratfink Internet. Open it. No, I can't... Come on, open it. Oh... I can't, it's... it's too much. They're fake. Well then I really can't. My mother was a huge Grace Kelly fan, and when I was a kid she used to dress up and wear these on movie night. Now this is is gonna sound very strange, but... If you could wear them in just one scene, uh, it would mean a lot to me. One scene in the movie? I'm in. That's... that's great! I uh... Happy Birthday. May this year be your best one ever. Hello? Alicia! It's Gavin. I just got you a gig! Really? That's great! Maybe! I don't presume. What is it? Now it's not a dancing gig. They saw the tape, they think you're hot. They think they might be able to use your name. For what? This is a little outside my world, Alicia, so I'm not entirely sure about all the details. What world? What're you talking about? Vivid, the porn company... The best porn company, as far as I know... And they just made you an offer. Alicia, you know what I mean when I say porn company? I know what you mean. Okay. I don't presume. That's not my job. Thank you. For what? For the whole day. It was amazing. You're amazing. I wasn't expecting that. I thought it was... It was... Stop. Anything you say now is just gonna be insulting. Fair. + I'm glad you had a Happy Birthday. Yeah. Um... Thank you for dinner and... You know, everything. Okay. I can't. I want to... I... It's just I'm trying to work the program and... I can't, obviously, have a relationship until I'm twelve months sober. You know the deal. But I really like you. I wanna be ready for you. Do I get to see you tomorrow? Yeah, I'd love that. I'll cut the check, all that... Yeah, okay. Good night. Good night. Hey.

No. Um... you know what? Let's just take a little breather. It's good. Good. Opposite. Opposite of good. Sorry. - Hi! - Hello. Would you like to come in? I like what you've done with the place. Yeah, I like to keep everything on the floor. It suits you. Why is that? 'Cause I'm a mess? Something like that. Well, make yourself at home. Thought I just did that. Wait, this is stupid. You're leaving? I've got a huge empty house and you're just gonna go back and stay at the Lux? Why don't you just... stay here? Stay as long as you'd like. Are you asking me to move in with you? I have this big empty house. You know who I was with tonight? A nice guy, who took me for a nice birthday dinner and got me a nice gift. You can't even get me an audition! This guy's a dentist and he got me an agent! Why do you need an agent... Wait... is it... Is it your birthday? Yes! Well, how am I supposed to know that? You're supposed to care! - What?! - The Internet, okay?! It's on the Internet! Okay, okay, um... Here. Happy Birthday! So how old are you now? What? I care, okay? What do you want from me?! Nothing! I don't want anything from you and that's exactly what I get! Well, then I'm giving you what you want then, aren't I?! It's not good enough, you're not good enough. You never were. I got a job offer. What? That's... Why didn't you-? That's great! From Vivid. Wha? That's like a dance company or something? Vivid is a porn company, Nick. Whoa! The porn company? That's... That's crazy. You're not thinking about actually doing it. It's just sex, Nick. Look. I know you're very comfortable with your body, okay? But this isn't... They are gonna use you up and throw you away... I'm already in an industry that does that. At least this way I'll be in control. How are you in control? I won't do anything I don't want to do. You won't be dancing. I'm not dancing now. So then you keep at it, and you, you try harder. I'm 26, okay? Time's running out. I can't afford school. I can't go back home. Okay, if this is about money, then, then, then maybe I can lend you... They're offering me a hundred thousand dollars. If you're asking me if I think this is a good idea, - I'm not asking you. - I'm not gonna sit here and lie to you. Then what're we even talking about? I wanna know if you're still gonna be my friend if I do it. I'm always gonna be your friend. I'm going in to sign the contract tomorrow. Will you come with me? So where were you? I was in Fresno with my friends. Yeah, this is definitely the nicest room I've ever been allowed in. How would you clean a room like this? They must buy bleach by the truckload. Alicia? Hi.
