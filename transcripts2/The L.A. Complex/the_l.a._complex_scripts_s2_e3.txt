I was trying to be quiet. Well, why didn't you come home last night? I'm sorry about that. I just lost track of time. Well, who were you out with? The two leads. Yeah, I just had a really a weird and stressful day, but my role could turn into something bigger if they like me, so I have to spend as much time with them as I can. I really needed you last night. Well, why didn't you text me? It wasn't really a text thing. I'm kinda losing my mind over this job. Why? Well, it turns out it's not for sure anymore. Now it's like a competition between me and this other writer. Who? Just, uh, some writer. Nick, you're gonna win. Everyone always loves you. Well, I dunno. Paul doesn't really like me, and I just can't seem to get comfortable- And... I'm just kinda freaking out a little and I'd love to talk to my girlfriend about it! I'm so sorry. Can we please talk about this later? I just can't be late again. Sure. What? Sure! Why are you yelling at me? I don't have a choice! Forget it. They can figure it out when I get there. I have to go. Okay? Yeah, go, fine. Why are you so upset? Well, where were you? You went out all night with God knows who. I say I need to talk to you and then you just run out the door again. We live together. This isn't how it's supposed to be. I'm late for work. What do you want from me? How about more than 5 minutes of your time. Look, you said you wanted a relationship with me and then you don't come home until the morning. Where are we? I can't deal with this right now, okay? Have a good day. You kinda killed any chance of that, but thanks. God, how much make-up do you wear? I was done hours ago. You had an earlier call time. I'm also a natural beauty. Oh, is that why your bathroom's full of all those creams and concealers? Those are all natural. Uh-huh. Thanks for pulling some strings and finally getting me on your dumb show. You're welcome. I'm just glad we get a chance to spend some time together. Plus I thought it would ease the sting of that whole cactibear situation. Well, you're a good boyfriend. Boyfriend, huh? I think I like the sound of that. So, are you nervous? You didn't get a lot of time to prepare. Oh, please. Just watch a real actor practice her craft. A real actor and a natural beauty. It is strange you don't work more. I've worked plenty, rookie. Hey, guys. Last minute revision for the walk and talk. R-revisions? This is a whole rewrite. Yeah. Blocking in 5. Hey. They can't just front light a mug like yours. We'll have plenty of time. We'll just run it until we have it, okay? Yeah, okay. Still gonna mop the floor with you. Your gown's open. Okay, little mama. I hear you callin' here with your sexy voice on. Why don't go and send me a picture, so I could see what the rest of that look like. All right, all right. I bet you get a lot of that too, huh, yeah? All right, girl, thank you for your call. We appreciate it. Up next up we got lil Dex. Yo, what you think about what infinite's sayin about you on his mixtape? Who? Infinite jest. Youngster. Yeah, him and his crew's all over YouTube, bro. Yeah, never heard of him. He says you're a bitch and you went soft! You gonna come back at him? How'm I supposed to come back at somebody I never heard of? Where's this kid again? The Internet? Yo, jest ain't no joke. He's crazy, man, he- yo, whatever. Man. If this little dude wanna throw rocks at the throne tell him to take a number. Yo, matter fact, have him call my label. I think we got some openings in the mail room. All right, next caller. We got my man Walter. Walter, you there? Yes, I'm here. You got a question for the king? Hello, kaldrick. Wha'sup? I wondered what your thoughts were on redemption. Redemption? You sellin' bibles? Do you believe in second chances? Do you believe in change? What kind of change we talkin', man? Fives? Tens? Yo, rook, throw my wallet. If you ever change your mind, the 19th street mission is always there for you. - Any time you want- - Okay, okay! We're gonna save the sermons for Sunday school. I'm sorry, king, man, we try to stop the crazy, but sometimes they leak through anyway. It's all good. Crazy people got questions too, man. True 'nuff, true 'nuff. All right, movin' right along. Next caller. John are you there? Oh my God, king! I'm your biggest fan! So, I was hoping that we could use these pictures our friends did for us, and I really don't think that needs the classes. I mean, he's already been booking gigs and stuff so... I can't use these. Excuse me? People are very picky about headshots and these aren't gonna cut it. But I don't see the big difference between Simon's pictures and these. Well, honey, that's why you're on that side of the desk. Right. Okay. It's just 'cause, to me- Beth, don't. Cute kid, bright shirt, big smile. Cute kid, bright shirt, big smile. She probably knows what she's talking about. The only difference I can see between this and these is that you don't make 600 bucks off of ours. Am I close? Can I come sit on that side of the desk now? I don't have time for this. Tell me one difference. I dare you. She's joking. It's not a real dare. I'm not joking! There are a thousand kids who are willing to do exactly as I ask. You want to know the difference? Those kids are represented by this agency. This one never will be. Look, we're really, really sorry. Simon, come on. Simon! It was nice meeting you. Why is doctor mehta listed is my lead physician? What are you doing out of bed, Margaret? If that clot dislodges from your arterial wall you won't make it to the operating table. But Patrick, I thought you were performing my surgery! This is the whole reason I came to St. Luke's! I can't operate on you, Margaret, I'm sorry. Can't or won't? Look, do I understand why you left? Yes. Do I think we're any good together? No. Have I moved on? Of course I have. But I still have feelings for you, Margaret. You calling the wedding off didn't change that. Patrick- I can't do this right now. I have to go tell a little boy that the pain in his stomach isn't appendicitis. Please, just... Leave me alone. And cut! Nailed it! Nice work, guys. Thank you. You're saving my ass today! All right, moving on! You're really good. That was kind of hot. Yeah? I can get a lot hotter. Where's your trailer? That was great! Jennifer. Hey, I had a meeting on the lot. I thought I'd stop by. You really great! Hi, I'm Jennifer. This is... this is Raquel. She's, um, one of the other actors today. This is Jennifer. My-my girlfriend. Girlfriend? I like the sound of that. ♪ Lord, lord, it's tearing us apart ♪ ♪ The way the love is holding on to your heart... ♪ Unprofessional?! I'd like to see her photographer pull off a shallow depth of field like this. It's a scam, kev. Nothing to do with the photos. Dude, look at it! They could literally use this shot to teach the rule of thirds! He's not listening. I don't know what to do. How about don't yell at the people who are trying to help us! Just shut up and play with your noodle. The adults are talking. "Adults." Right. Have you tried the breakdown services? Not yet. Is it 'cause you don't know what I'm talkin' about? Maybe. Okay. Whenever there's an audition, casting agents send out a breakdown, all right? "Looking for a kid, under 5 feet," needs to jump rope, that sort of thing. Right. It's only supposed to go to agents, but there's a lot of websites that actually post it illegally. Really? That's great! Yeah, it's only like 15 bucks a month. You put in your credit card information, you cut out the middleman. I don't have a credit card. I'll put in mine and then you pay me back. It's not like I don't know where you live. - Really? - Yeah. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you so much! Yup. Yeah, uh, all right. We're supposed to be restructuring act one, man. It'll just take a second. Okay. Okay. I need to get into this. Good morning. Super-fun last night. Yeah. Are you okay? I'm just nervous about this scene. Why are good actresses always such terrible liars? You're lying to me. Just stand a little closer like you're going to do for camera please? Seriously. What's up? Nick and I got in a fight this morning. He was mad because I stayed out so late. Sorry about that. It's not your fault. Closer please. Well, kinda it is. I didn't want you to leave. You're just too much fun, Abby vargas. All right, let's try one. Roll. And action! This isn't about what my dad believes, Veronica. This is about what I believe. You must think I'm such a slut. I like you. I like you a lot, but we gotta take things slow, okay? Cut! Oh, did I- yes, you did. I'm so sorry! I'm not used to pretend kissing. Abby, a word? In private. Good luck. My sister used to call shampoo "hair poo". That's pretty funny. Is that like something that is in Australia? No, no, it was just a... So how'd you- how'd you two kids meet? Mmm... How'd we- our agents set us up. Um, he thought that Connor would be great for a movie I'm developing. It was supposed to be a 15 minute meet-and-greet. Next thing I knew it was the morning. Well, isn't that best? You know, that... that organic, real, instant chemistry. I've never felt anything like it. Well, he's clearly smitten. Look at him! How long have you been an actress? A little while. Anything I would have seen you in? Apparently not. Raquel was in that show- oh, there it is! What's this for? Happy Birthday. It's your-your birthday. I didn't know it was your birthday. Why would you? Okay, so this is from a really healthy bakery. There's no refined sugar or oils or shortenings. And don't let this freak you out, but it's made with tofu, low fat buttermilk and apple sauce. It's really good! Yum! So lucky! Could you grab a knife? Yes, I was just about to. Mmm. It's good, right? Healthy. ♪ Blinded by the light's, ha ♪ ♪ Then years later you were blinded by his right, ha ♪ ♪ Guess love really is blind ain't that right, ma? ♪ ♪ 'Cause he's out scornin' ♪ ♪ And now you can't see out your left eye! ♪ ♪ It's mostly nightmares in my bed ♪ ♪ Runnin' the race with plastic wrapped around my head ♪ ♪ Lost in the ocean with a light ♪ ♪ Jacket made of led ♪ ♪ Wish I could just rest my life dear lord, ♪ ♪ That's all I beg! ♪ Why did you stop? It wasn't good, man. Put another track on. Okay, what aren't you feelin'? I'm not a producer, am I?! Well, I am the producer! What's the problem, kal? Man, the problem is... All the beats he's given me is whack! Whack? You know what? I'd give you somethin' else, but I'm all out of interns. - What'd you say?! - What you gonna do? Knock me out? I ain't a kid, kal. I'm done. - Come on, kal. - Leave me alone! Man, we're pushin' him. He ain't ready. He just needs a second, all right? Man, you think it's smart to ever leave that man alone? Ever? He's wastin' my time, man. I'll be right back. Yo king! Yo kal! Yo, hold up, man. Whatcha wanna do, man? You wanna drop this? Move on to the interview with spin? Yo, talk to me, man. Whatcha wanna do? I just need to get home and not think about anything right now, okay? I need to get away from this. All right, okay. We could do that. We'll just push everything back. You know what I'm sayin'? One more day won't hurt, right? And we'll just pick this all up tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow. Hey, can we, uh, I just wanted... We got sorta interrupted yesterday and I just... Okay, look. If it wasn't for Abby I totally... I like you a lot, but I just... because I'm... I just need to focus on me and her, okay? Is that-that okay? No hard feelings? What the hell is this? I don't uh... Ew. "Dear Scott... Much soul-searching..." Have come to the decision that comedy is not for me... Please understand this was a tough decision, but I have to follow my heart. Please accept this letter as my official resignation. "Adieu, Nick Wagner?!" This is not-! Scott, I didn't write this! I swear! I don't- First of all I don't sign my name with a heart over the 'I'. I'm not... This is amazing, amazing! Very funny. I am gonna keep this on file in case you want to follow your heart later. I was wondering who sprinkles glitter on their resignation letter?! Ha ha ha. Yeah, fun and games, right? Hard feelings, Nick, hard feelings. Rook, what is all this, man? Yo, I made a few calls. I put the word out. I said I wanted to get away from everything. You know, I hear you. You need an escape. So punch out for a few hours. I mean, what's the sense of all this hustle if we can't enjoy ourselves, right? That's you. Thank you. So, how'd it go with Donald? I'm at two strikes. One for the nipples, now this... Ouch. Yeah, apparently I'm an old testament kisser, And he wants me to be a new testament kisser. Oh, sorry about that. I should have warned you. Don't worry. I'm gonna talk to him, smooth it over. He listens to me, so. Seriously, that'd be great. All right, let's make one. Hey, um, I was thinkin', you should call your boyfriend and apologize. I thought it was your fault that I stayed out late. You should apologize. But I'm a big believer in doin' whatever it is to make things right. I'm been in enough of these fights with Laura to know: Now you didn't come home last night, regardless of who said what, he's gonna win. All right, let's roll. Quiet. Settle... and action. This isn't about what my dad believes, Veronica. This is about what I believe. You must think I'm such a slut. I like you. I like you a lot, but we gotta take things slow, okay? Cut! There. You see? Perfect. Good one, buddy. Moving on. Just admit it. You erased my hard drive. Computers crash, Nick. It happens all the time. This isn't... You have to stop this. You're not playing fair. Oh, Nick, you're in the big-boy world now and sometimes things in the big-boy world aren't fair. Listen- Scott's gonna fire one of us. You realize that, right? Yes, I- So, if you don't think I'm gonna use every trick in the book to keep this job, you're not only crazy, but you should probably quit right now. You know that nothing you do will ever make me quit. You got that? So just focus on the work and stop playing these mind games. Fine. Oh, man, I forgot Scott's animal fries. What? Did you order Scott's animal fries? No, I didn't. It's not on the list... Never mind. I'll go get them. Scott said it was important. Nah, I don't think so! I'm getting' the animal fries, all right? I am gonna get Scott's precious animal fries... Oh, wait I don't have my- Wallet. My cell phone. Great. Margaret! Patrick. It's okay. You're gonna be okay. You're a better doctor than that. I should have stayed. Built a family. Stay with me now. I love you. It's always been you. I love you too. Cut! Check it! Almost believed you there. I'm a really good actor. Gate's good. Moving on! Connor, I- You guys are so great together! Think they'll bring me back? You never know. I'm going. You want to walk me out? Sure. Nice working with you. You too. Hi, uh, we're here for my brother's audition. No kidding? What's his name? Simon pirelli. He might not be on the list. Did your agent confirm you? I was hoping that you could just- did your agent confirm you or not? What does that mean? She for sure confirmed us. What's the name of your agent? Alison woodridge. She called last minute and said just to come over and that she would talk to you. Nobody talked to me, and if he's not on the list, he doesn't audition. I'm sorry, Simon. But the lady's not gonna let you in. But... I worked so hard! I know. Can you just give him two minutes. There's nothing I can do. Told you it wouldn't work. Now what? Come on. It's all good.

You know, tryin' to sabotage me. I had to walk here! I could have been raped or shot with a gun. That's hilarious, Sabrina. Nick, nobody likes a tattle-tale. What? But she- ah ah. We've been writing desk pieces all day. Paul wants us to pitch him ten each tomorrow. Ten?! Is that going to be a problem? No. I'm on it. All righty then! See you tomorrow.

Did she have to go home make your lunch for tomorrow? Yes, Jennifer left. Thank you. I'm sorry about that. Let me take you out for your birthday. You forgot my birthday. How was I supposed to know? The Internet. It's on the Internet. Ooh. Right. Well, now I know and have all this top-of-show money burning a hole in my pocket. So, let me take you out. Yeah, um... Listen, I also want to talk to you about something- Jennifer's taking me out. Why? She already brought you that disgusting applesauce cake for lunch. They've arranged for a paparazzi to find us at some out of the way place. It's our first photo-op. Right. Connor? I'm sorry. You okay? Yeah, it's fine. I'll see you at home. Yeah, you just tell me whatever you need to then. Okay. Okay. You want somethin'? Come on. Everybody wants somethin'. Well, how about a few bucks then? Hey-why is that chick you banged answering your phone?! What? I called you today and Sabrina picked up. Are you screwing her?! No! No! She's screwing me. Not, not in a... like that... In a... but in a work way. We're screwing at work. She's screwing me at work in a work way. It's-she's the one I'm competing with, okay? Why wouldn't you tell me that? When?! Last night when you didn't come home or this morning when you didn't want to talk about it? I told you, I went out with the cast. Okay, working there is like walking though a minefield- and we're back to talking about you! Okay, look, I'm sorry, okay? I should have told you about Sabrina. I just... I wanted to actually sit down- I was an idiot. I don't know what I was thinking and I'm sorry. We rushed this. What? We moved to fast because I needed a place to live. Wait, just hold on a second. I have a little cash now, maybe I should just get my own room. So, what, you're gonna breaking up with me? No, no, I'm just saying that we should slow down... A lot. That sounds like breaking up. Are you having fun? Relationships are supposed to be fun, right? Okay, this is stupid. We just need some time to actually sit down and talk. Well, where are you gonna sleep tonight? I'll figure something out. I always do. Abby... I'll pick up the rest later. Thanks. For everything. Abby... Dowbiggin casting. Hi, this is Simon pirelli's sister. I was just wondering if you guys had made a decision about- You don't call us. If he books the part we call your agent. No, I know I- We didn't call. He didn't get it. Oh. I just thought- So look... You didn't book this one. Okay. It's okay to be angry, you know. It's-it's actually- it's healthy to let it out. I don't feel that bad. Simon, it's okay to be mad. It's okay to be really, really mad! I think this is just how it all works, Beth. We gotta go on a lot of these things before I book something. A lot of them? What, this is gonna be like a full time job? Yeah, you didn't realize that? Oh, I'll get it. Oh, hey guys, what's up? Hey. They gave us too much Chinese. Yeah, they overcharged us too. Just thought you might wanna, you know... No pressure. Yeah, no.
