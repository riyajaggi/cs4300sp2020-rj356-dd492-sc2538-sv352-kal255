 [ WOLF HOWLS ] Narrator: THE WILDS OF ALASKA, VAST, UNTAMED, AND DANGEROUS. THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT CAN KILL YOU. PREDATORS, MASKED BY THE MERCILESS COLD OR THE UNRELENTING MIDNIGHT SUN. Petterson: YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH UNDERSTAND WHAT AN ANIMAL'S GONNA DO. IT'S THE HUMANS YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH. Macdonald: IT WAS THE MOST VIOLENT NIGHT, AND TO THIS DAY, IT WAS THE MOST VIOLENT NIGHT IN ANCHORAGE HISTORY. Mason: I THINK THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN

 IN THE STATE OF ALASKA. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING, JUST PLAIN EVIL. DOESN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN THIS. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: ALASKA IS A PLACE OF EXTREMES. IN WINTER, IT SLUMBERS IN A DARK AND BITTER CHILL. IN SUMMER, IT BATHES IN THE LIGHT OF THE MIDNIGHT SUN. ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S JUST DAYLIGHT, ENDLESS AMOUNTS OF DAYLIGHT. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE SUN SETTING AT 11:30, 11:45 AT NIGHT. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CONCEPT OF TIME. Narrator: IN THE SUMMER OF 1982, ANCHORAGE NEVER SLEEPS. MacDonald: BARS WERE BASICALLY --

 THEY CLOSED LONG ENOUGH TO SWEEP. THE PEOPLE OUT WHO HAD BEEN DRINKING ALL NIGHT, CLEANED THE PLACE UP A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THEY'D REOPEN. AND PEOPLE WOULD COME BACK IN, YOU KNOW. IT WAS DEFINITELY A FRONTIER TOWN, WILD-WEST MENTALITY. Narrator: FILLED WITH THAT INDEPENDENT ALASKAN SPIRIT, V.J. SYLVESTER, AND HIS BEST BUDDY, DEAN KIMLER, SOAK UP THE LATE NIGHT SUN IN RUSSIAN JACK SPRINGS PARK. THEY HAD BEEN IN AN APARTMENT WITH TWO OR THREE OTHER GUYS. AND THEN I GUESS SOME OTHERS HAD MOVED IN. IT APPARENTLY HAD GOTTEN VERY CROWDED. SO, THEY DECIDED TO BE OUT ON THEIR OWN. EVEN IN THE DEAD OF WINTER, IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE, EVEN A FAMILY, LIVING IN A VISQUEEN TENT. IT'S JUST KIND OF DIFFERENT, MOST CITY FOLKS DON'T UNDERSTAND. Petterson: IN ALASKA, WE LIVE DIFFERENTLY. IT'S NOT STRESSED, IT'S NOT RUSHED, WE KIND OF GO HOW WE WANT TO GO, DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO. Narrator: ON MAY 3rd, V.J.'S GIRLFRIEND, STEPHANIE, AND HER FRIEND, AMBER, JOIN THE BOYS AT THE PARK. TOMORROW IS STEPHANIE'S 17th BIRTHDAY. THE KIDS WERE GOING TO THE MOVIES, OR SOMETHING, TO CELEBRATE. SINCE HIS BUDDY WAS GOING WITH HIM, SHE INVITED HER BEST FRIEND TO GO, SO THERE WOULDN'T BE LIKE A THIRD-WHEEL TYPE THING. THERE'D BE FOUR OF THEM. Narrator: BUT THE CELEBRATION IS QUICKLY ECLIPSED BY A NIGHTMARISH HORROR, NEVER BEFORE SEEN IN THIS TOWN. [ GUNSHOTS ] IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION, OR THE CHALLENGER EXPLOSION. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS WHERE WHEN YOU HEARD THE NEWS, AT LEAST FOR ME, I REMEMBER EXACTLY WHERE I WAS, EXACTLY WHAT I WAS DOING. Narrator: AT 8:10 P.M., A STRING OF CHAOTIC CALLS ERUPTS FROM ANCHORAGE POLICE OFFICERS' TWO-WAY RADIOS. Kasper: WE GOT THE CALL THAT THERE WERE FOUR KIDS WHO HAD BEEN SHOT IN RUSSIAN JACK PARK. [ SIREN WAILING ] IT'S ONE OF THOSE THAT JUST MAKES YOUR HEART STOP, WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE? [ SIREN WAILING ] Narrator: OFFICERS RACE TO THE 300-ACRE PARK, A PERFECT SPOT FOR LOVERS... AND NOW, MURDER. Grimes: IT WAS A SHOCKER FOR ALL OF ANCHORAGE. IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYBODY AT THE WRONG PLACE, AT THE WRONG TIME. MacDonald: IT IS BROAD DAYLIGHT, PEOPLE ARE KIND OF COMING OUT OF THEIR WINTER SLUMBER. THIS ISN'T SOME DARK STREET CORNER IN SOME ALLEY WAY, OR WHATEVER. THIS IS IN A WELL-USED, VERY POPULAR PARK, RIGHT SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF ANCHORAGE. Narrator: NOT FAR FROM THE FIRST BODY, POLICE NOTICE A SECOND VICTIM LYING IN THE FRESH GRASS. THIS ONE'S GOT A PULSE, GET ME A MEDIC UP HERE. WE'VE GOT TWO MORE BODIES DOWN THE HILL. FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, ONE YOUNG MAN IS DEAD. MAN, HE'S JUST A KID. HE'S DEAD. ANOTHER, CLINGING TO LIFE NEARBY. I'VE GOT A PULSE, HE'S STILL ALIVE. GET ME A MEDIC. Grimes: IT WAS LIKE IN SUCCESSION OF SOMEBODY, EITHER STARTING AT ONE END OR THE OTHER, WAS KILLING THEM ONE AT A TIME. EACH WAS UNAWARE THAT THE OTHER HAD BEEN SHOT. THIS WAS JUST METHODIC. IT WAS JUST WALKING A TRAIL, MEET SOMEBODY ON THAT TRAIL, SHOOT 'EM, DON'T STOP, KEEP GOING. MEET SOMEBODY ELSE, SHOOT 'EM, DON'T STOP, KEEP GOING. Narrator: BOTH BOYS HAD BEEN SHOT IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD. BOTH GIRLS, IN THE FACE. ONE, DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE EYES. POINT BLANK, EACH OF THEM, ONE BULLET IN THE HEAD. ONE FROM A DISTANCE OF 14 INCHES. EFFICIENT AND UNBELIEVABLY SCARY AND BIZARRE. NONE OF THE KIDS WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON UNTIL THEY WERE SO CLOSE IT WAS TOO LATE. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: AS MEDICS SCRAMBLE TO SAVE THE SURVIVORS, OFFICERS HOPE ONE OF THE KIDS WILL LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO I.D. THE GUNMAN, BUT THE ODDS ARE SLIM. I THINK THAT ANYBODY THAT RESPONDED AND SAW THEM BEING TRUCKED AWAY WITH HEAD WOUNDS, NOBODY WAS GOING TO SURVIVE, NOBODY WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL US ANYTHING. Narrator: ANCHORAGE PD SCRAMBLES TOGETHER A 25-MAN INVESTIGATIVE TEAM. Grimes: CALLS WERE GOING TO DAY-SHIFT DETECTIVES TO COME OUT. CALLS WERE GOING OUT TO OFFICERS THAT WERE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE TOWN, THAT THEY COULD COME IN AND ASSIST. Narrator: AND NOT JUST FOR THIS CRIME, BUT FOR ANOTHER SHOOTING IN TOWN. Kasper: THE PHONE DISPATCH CALLED AND SAID THERE WAS A SHOOTING AT A NEIGHBORHOOD HANGOUT. Narrator: LESS THAN FIVE MILES AWAY, AT THE BLACK BULL TAVERN, POLICE DISCOVER A MAN AND A WOMAN LYING NEAR THE BAR. THE BODY OF ANOTHER MAN IS JUST A FEW FEET AWAY. THERE WAS BLOOD ALL OVER THE FLOOR. Narrator: BUT, FOR THE WILD-WEST BAR CROWD, IT'S NO REASON TO END THE NIGHT. PATRONS AT THE BAR WERE JUST SITTING THERE LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED, DRINKING. Narrator: ALL THREE VICTIMS SUFFERED A SINGLE GUNSHOT TO THE HEAD, JUST LIKE THE FOUR KIDS FOUND IN THE PARK. Kasper: I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE CONNECTED BECAUSE YOU GET ALL THESE PEOPLE SHOT. THEY'RE ALL REPORTEDLY SHOT IN THE HEAD, SO IT WAS THE SAME M.O. WE DIDN'T KNOW IF SOMEBODY HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST THEM AND KILLED THEM ALL. THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY TARGETED, THE QUESTION WAS BY WHO? SOMEONE THEY KNEW OR A RANDOM SHOOTING? WE WERE TOTALLY STUMPED. WE HAD NO CLUE. Narrator: POLICE ARE RATTLED BY THE LOOMING FEAR THAT EVIL IS STILL OUT THERE, SHROUDED SOMEHOW IN THE MIDNIGHT SUN. YOU'RE ALWAYS WONDERING, "IS THIS PERSON STANDING OUT HERE, WATCHING US?" Narrator: PERHAPS POISED TO STRIKE AGAIN AT ANY MOMENT. Kasper: WE WERE CONCERNED THAT WE HAD A SERIAL MURDERER ON THE LOOSE, AND RANDOMLY MAYBE JUST SELECTING VICTIMS AND KILLING THEM. Grimes: I THINK THAT WAS UPPERMOST IN EVERYBODY'S MIND, YOU KNOW, WHO IS THIS GUY, WHERE IS HE? HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE IS HE GOING TO KILL?

IT WAS THE MOST VIOLENT NIGHT, AND TO THIS DAY, IT IS THE MOST VIOLENT NIGHT IN ANCHORAGE HISTORY. Narrator: SEVEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED IN TWO SEPARATE SHOOTINGS, THREE AT A LOCAL BAR, AND FOUR OTHERS IN NEARBY RUSSIAN JACK SPRINGS PARK, INCLUDING V.J. SYLVESTER. AT FIRST, HIS MOTHER HAS NO IDEA HE'S GONE. Thornton: THE FIRST WE HEARD OF IT WAS ON THE NEWS ON TV THAT NIGHT. AND I REMEMBER WE ALL SAID A PRAYER FOR THE FAMILIES, WE WERE ALL REAL SAD. THESE KIDS DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO EVEN DEFEND THEMSELVES OR KNOW WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. Narrator: THEN THE PAIN BECOMES PERSONAL. Thornton: THE NEXT MORNING, BEFORE GETTING THE KIDS UP FOR SCHOOL, THERE WAS A KNOCK ON THE DOOR, AND THERE WAS A STATE TROOPER. AND THAT'S WHEN WE FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS MY SON. Narrator: ALASKA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A FRESH START FOR NORMA THORNTON AND HER CHILDREN. SHE MOVED NORTH IN 1977, AFTER HER HUSBAND PASSED AWAY. Thornton: WE DECIDED THAT WE NEEDED A NEW... SOMETHING NEW IN OUR LIFE. SO WE BOUGHT AN OLD SCHOOL BUS, AND MADE A MOTOR HOME, AND CAME NORTH. IT WAS HEALING AND NEW BEGINNING. WE FISHED, MOSTLY CAUGHT OUR OWN DINNER AND SUCH, BERRY-PICKING AND GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER. Narrator: V.J. WAS HER OLDEST SON. Thornton: HE WAS 18. THAT SPOT IN-BETWEEN ADOLESCENCE AND BECOMING A MAN, AND STANDING ON HIS OWN TWO FEET. AND HE WAS REALLY EMPHATIC ABOUT WANTING TO BE HIS OWN PERSON, AND MAKE HIS OWN WAY. Petterson: HE WANTED TO EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING THAT ALASKA HAD TO OFFER, EVERYTHING. HE JUST WANTED TO SEE IT ALL, EXPERIENCE IT ALL, TAKE IT ALL IN. Narrator: NOW, AS BAFFLED AS POLICE, HIS FAMILY STRUGGLES TO COMPREHEND HIS LOSS. I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A REASON. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE, OF COURSE, MURDER NEVER DOES. Thornton: I COULD NOT HAVE CHANGED THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF WHAT THE END RESULT. BUT I COULD HAVE BEEN THERE, I COULD HAVE MAYBE HELD HIS HAND, SAID GOODBYE. Narrator: GIVEN THE SIMILAR M.O., AUTHORITIES SUSPECT THE TWO CRIMES ARE RELATED. THEY FIRST QUESTION THE PATRONS WHO'D BEEN INSIDE THE BAR. EACH TELLS A SIMILAR STORY. [ FILM REEL CLICKING ] Kasper: A YOUNG MAN HAD COME IN AND FOUND HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND AT THE BAR, TALKING TO AN OLDER GENTLEMAN. AND HE WENT OUT TO HIS CAR, AND CAME BACK IN. SAM. [ GUNSHOTS ] Narrator: THE SHOOTER ENDED HIS OWN LIFE. BUT DID HE UNLEASH HIS RAGE ON THE CAMPERS BEFORE COMING TO THE BAR? [ FILM REEL STOPS ] WE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE HE HAD GONE TO THE PARK AND KILLED THE FOUR KIDS FIRST, AND THEN CAME IN, AND THAT WAS FURTHER MOTIVATION FOR HIM TO KILL HIMSELF. Narrator: THE TWO SHOOTINGS ALSO SHARE OTHER SIMILARITIES, LIKE THE BAR, THE PARK HAD BEEN CROWDED. IT SHOWED US EITHER THAT HE WAS VERY SECURE IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE, OR JUST VERY BRAZEN ABOUT IT. Narrator: BOTH CRIMES HAD TAKEN PLACE IN THE LIGHT OF THE LATE-NIGHT SUMMER SUN. Schmidt: PEOPLE IN THE WINTERTIME GET A LOT OF SLEEP, AND IN THE SUMMERTIME, NOT MUCH SLEEP AT ALL. WHEN A PERSON'S SLEEP DEPRIVED, THEY'RE NOT THINKING CLEARLY. THEY CAN MAKE UP THINGS IN THEIR MINDS THAT REALLY AREN'T THERE. AND IT CAN DEFINITELY EFFECT PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR. Narrator: COULD THAT EXPLAIN THE MURDERS? HAD THE SUMMER SUN SET THE SHOOTER OFF? DID SLEEP DEPRIVATION DRIVE A MAN TO KILL SEVEN PEOPLE IN A SINGLE NIGHT? Grimes: WHOEVER KILLED THESE PEOPLE WAS JUST A STRANGER WALKING THROUGH A PARK AND SHOOTING PEOPLE THAT HE MEETS. JUST COLDLY AND METHODICALLY GETTING RID OF PEOPLE. AND, IF THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FIVE OR SIX ON THAT TRAIL HE HAD PASSED, HE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY SHOT THEM, TOO. Macdonald: IT JUST SEEMED VERY RANDOM, AND THAT SHOOK THE COMMUNITY EVEN MORE SO. THAT SCARED AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE. IT SEEMED SO RANDOM, IT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYBODY. Narrator: POLICE WORKED TO ESTABLISH A TIMELINE. THROUGH THE TIME STAMPS ON 911 CALLS, THEY DETERMINED THE PARK SHOOTINGS HAPPENED ALMOST AN HOUR AFTER THE MURDER-SUICIDE AT THE BAR. THAT MEANS THE CRIMES AREN'T THE WORK OF ONE GUNMAN, BUT TWO. ONE IS DEAD, BUT THE OTHER IS STILL AT LARGE. WE HAD NO EYE WITNESSES, WE HAD NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE, SO WE WERE HOPING THAT THE PUBLIC WOULD CHIME IN OR SOMETHING WOULD TURN UP. Grimes: WE ARE AS IN THE DARK AS THE REST OF THE PUBLIC. AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST HOPING SOMEONE COMES FORWARD AND GIVES YOU THAT ONE LITTLE PIECE OF INFORMATION. WHAT IS SO SCARY IS THE PERSON'S STILL OUT THERE. HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE IS HE GONNA KILL BEFORE WE CAN CATCH UP TO HIM? CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW? Narrator: POLICE TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO THE DOZENS OF PARK-GOERS WHO HAD BEEN AT RUSSIAN JACK SPRINGS. HI, TREVOR. HI. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW? [ FILM REEL CLICKING ] Tew: WE'D HEARD A COUPLE OF POW, POW, BANGS, YOU KNOW. I REMEMBER THINKING TO MYSELF, "COOL, FIREWORKS." I WAS JUST A KID, SO I'M JUST KIND OF RUNNING, LEADING THE WAY, RUNNING UP THE HILL, AND SEEING THIS MAN STANDING THERE. AND I KIND OF STOPPED IN MY TRACKS. AND HE WAS JUST OF REACHING HIS HAND INTO HIS PANTS, PUTTING THE GUN AWAY. WE ALL KIND OF FROZE. I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. HE YELLS, "GET OUT OF HERE!" AS LOUD AS HE COULD. AND I REMEMBER MY MOM SAYING, "EXCUSE ME?" AND THEN, THAT'S WHEN HE TURNED AROUND AND JUST, IN A RAGE, SCREAMED, BOTH HANDS IN THE AIR TYPE THING, "GET OUT OF HERE!" Man: GET OUT OF HERE!" Narrator: A MAN, WHO HAD BEEN WALKING HIS DOG IN THE PARK, GIVES POLICE MORE. Kasper: THE DOG'S CUT HIS PAW, SO HE WAS CARRYING THE DOG, AND IT WAS HEAVY. SO, HE'D CARRY IT ABOUT 100 FEET, AND SET IT DOWN TO REST. ONE OF THE TIMES HE RESTED, HE LOOKED INTO THE WOODS AND HE SAW A BRAND-NEW BIKE LEANING UP AGAINST THE TREE. [ BELL RINGS ] HE STATED HE HAD WORKED AT A BICYCLE SHOP, AND HE KNEW IT WAS PEARL BLUE, THAT IT WAS NOT THE STANDARD 26-INCH, BUT A 27-INCH. Narrator: THE MAN SAYS HE THOUGHT THE BIKE MIGHT HAVE BEEN STOLEN. HE CONSIDERED MOVING IT OUT OF THE WOODS, WHEN HE WAS SUDDENLY SPOOKED. HE NOTICED SOMEBODY WAS PEERING THROUGH THE BUSHES AT HIM. AND THAT MADE HIM PRETTY NERVOUS. Narrator: HE LOADED UP HIS DOG AND TOOK OFF... COMPLETELY UNAWARE A SHOOTER HAD BATHED THE PARK IN BLOOD. AUTHORITIES' WORST FEARS ARE NOW REAL. A DERANGED MASS MURDERER IS HIDING SOMEWHERE IN THE DENSE SUMMER WILDERNESS. YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU AND KEEP LOOKING AROUND TO KEEP A MENTAL INVENTORY. ARE YOU PUTTING YOURSELF IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION OF PREDATORS, BOTH WILD AND HUMAN? Narrator: BOTH UNDETERRED FROM CLAIMING THEIR NEXT KILL. THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FEAR OUT THERE. WE DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE WHO DID THIS, AND THEY WERE STILL OUT THERE. [ WOLF HOWLS ] Thornton: I WAS REALLY WORRIED FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY JUST KILLED KIDS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THEY'RE GOING TO KILL. [ BELL RINGS ] Narrator: ANCHORAGE POLICE HUNT FOR AN ICE-COLD KILLER WHO GUNNED DOWN FOUR TEENS IN RUSSIAN JACK SPRINGS PARK. MURDER, NO MATTER WHO IS INVOLVED, WHO IS THE VICTIM, IS A HORRIBLE CRIME. IT ALWAYS MAKES YOUR HEART SKIP A BEAT, MAKES YOUR BLOOD RUN COLD, BUT WHEN YOU HEAR THAT IT'S FOUR TEENAGERS WHO ARE CAMPING IN THAT AREA, IT HITS YOU A LITTLE HARDER, QUITE A BIT HARDER. SO, AS THE DETAILS CAME OUT ON THIS STORY, IT -- YEAH, IT REALLY SHOOK THE COMMUNITY IN A BIG WAY. POLICE CONTINUE SEARCHING FOR ANSWERS IN A BRUTAL QUADRUPLE SLAYING AT RUSSIAN JACK SPRINGS PARK. Gruenstein: THERE WAS, I THINK, GENERAL FEAR, PANIC, A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? HOW COULD FOUR KIDS BE DEAD? WHO WAS THE KILLER? CAN HE DO IT AGAIN? Narrator: SO FAR, THE BEST LEADS STEM FROM EYE WITNESSES, WHO'D SEEN A TALL, DARK-HAIRED MAN IN THE PARK THAT BRIGHTLY LIT NIGHT. POLICE APPEAL TO A COMMUNITY ALREADY ON EDGE FOR MORE HELP. I WOULD REQUEST AT THIS TIME THAT ANYONE... Anchorman: THE CHIEF OF ANCHORAGE POLICE HELD A PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY, TO ASK RESIDENTS FOR HELP IN SOLVING THE RUSSIAN JACK SPRINGS PARK MURDERS. SO FAR, ABOUT 100 TIPS HAVE BEEN CALLED IN BY RESIDENTS AND POLICE ARE FOLLOWING UP... THERE WAS A LOT OF PUBLICITY GENERATED ON THIS AND YOU'RE JUST HOPING, YOU KNOW... I MEAN, CASES ARE SOLVED BY PEOPLE CALLING IN. Narrator: WITHIN HOURS, THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES A CHILLING TIP FROM A FRIEND OF AMBER OLSEN, ONE OF THE FEMALE VICTIMS. [ FILM REEL CLICKING ] SHE SUGGESTS THEY TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT AMBER'S EX-BOYFRIEND, RICK LARKIN. THE TIPSTER TOLD POLICE THAT HE HAD A HISTORY OF VIOLENT BEHAVIOR... CARRIED A GUN. Schmidt: ALASKA'S A WELL-ARMED SOCIETY. PEOPLE CARRY HANDGUNS, COMMONLY, WHEREVER THEY GO FOR BEAR PROTECTION, THINGS LIKE THAT. Narrator: BUT WAS LARKIN ARMED FOR ANOTHER REASON? Macdonald: THE TIPSTER TOLD POLICE THAT HE DROVE A VAN AROUND TOWN, AND THERE WERE REPORTS OF A VAN IN THE RUSSIAN JACK AREA THAT NIGHT. Narrator: THE TIPSTER ALSO SAYS RICK LARKIN AND V.J. SYLVESTER HAD A HEATED ARGUMENT SHORTLY BEFORE THE MURDERS. HEY, I GOT A FEW WORDS TO SAY TO YOU. AND THAT AMBER HAD ONLY RECENTLY ENDED THEIR RELATIONSHIP. APPARENTLY, HE HAD THREATENED TO KILL HER AFTER THEY BROKE UP. OUR FIRST THOUGHT WAS HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE ANY WITNESSES BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHO HE WAS. YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE MAN. ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW? YOU'RE GONNA BE A DEAD MAN IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL. [ FILM REEL STOPS ] Narrator: POLICE IMMEDIATELY ARREST LARKIN ON OUTSTANDING TRAFFIC WARRANTS. WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP... HE FITS THE GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE MENACING STRANGER SEEN IN THE PARK. LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS. THEY'RE EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS OF ABRASIONS ON HIS HANDS. IT WASN'T OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF POSSIBILITIES THAT IT WAS A JEALOUS BOYFRIEND. I'VE DEALT WITH A LOT OF DOMESTIC HOMICIDES THAT WERE THAT KIND OF RAGE. WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE CUTS? CAN YOU EXPLAIN THOSE? Narrator: BUT LARKIN REMAINS TIGHT-LIPPED, WILLING TO TALK ONLY TO HIS ATTORNEY. MIGHT THE JILTED LOVER BE THE STRANGER THE DOG-WALKER HAD SEEN IN THE PARK? WAS HE THE GUY WITH THE GUN AND THE ONE RIDING THE MYSTERIOUS BIKE? HOW MANY SHOOTERS DO WE HAVE... [ BELL RINGS ] ...USING A BIKE [CHUCKLES] AS A GETAWAY? WE'RE PROBABLY JUST TRYING TO FIND A WITNESS. SOMEBODY THAT DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HE'S A WITNESS, BUT WAS IN THE PARK AT THAT TIME. MAYBE HE SAW SOMETHING THAT WE CAN USE. Narrator: TO CHECK ON THE MYSTERY RIDER, DETECTIVES CALL ON THE MANAGER OF THE LOCAL BIKE SHOP. [ FILM REEL CLICKING ] HE RECALLS SELLING A PEARL BLUE BIKE TWO MONTHS EARLIER... Man: HEY, THERE. OH, HEY. HOW YOU DOING? YEAH, I'M LOOKING FOR A BIKE. GREAT, I THINK I CAN HELP YOU OUT... ...JUST LIKE THE ONE SEEN IN THE PARK. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? SOMETHING WITH A BIGGER FRAME WOULD DO. FANTASTIC, I'VE GOT A NICE BIKE OVER HERE. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THIS? HE SEEMED TO REMEMBER THE SALE BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN EARLY ONE BEFORE THE BIKE BUSINESS PICKED UP. AND HE SAID THE GUY KNEW WHAT HE WANTED. Narrator: THE CUSTOMER'S WISH LIST INCLUDED A CARGO POUCH, A LOCK AND CABLE, AND STRANGELY, A BELL TO WARN PEOPLE HE WAS COMING. Macdonald: YEAH, IT WAS A LITTLE ODD. IT WAS SOMETHING RESERVED MORE FOR A YOUNG CHILD. Narrator: THE BIKE SHOP MANGER PULLS THE PURCHASE RECORD, AND OFFERS POLICE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT THE CUSTOMER. INCLUDING AN ADDRESS, 2900 PROVIDENCE DRIVE. YOU JUST KNEW THAT ADDRESS. WE ALL KNEW ANYTIME YOU GET A NUT CASE, YOU KNOW, INVOLVED IN ANY CALL, YOU TOOK THEM TO 2900 PROVIDENCE. 2900 PROVIDENCE IS THE ALASKA PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE, ALSO KNOWN AS A.P.I. POLICE WONDER IF AMBER OLSEN'S DISTRAUGHT EX-BOYFRIEND USED A FAKE ADDRESS. OR MIGHT HE HAVE BEEN THE ONE SEEKING PSYCHIATRIC HELP? Narrator: KNOWING THE GUNMAN BEHIND A GRISLY QUADRUPLE MURDER CAN'T HIDE FOREVER IN THE LAND OF THE MIDNIGHT SUN, AUTHORITIES HONE IN ON A JILTED EX-BOYFRIEND OF ONE OF THE VICTIMS. I HEARD SHE'S YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND, AND YOU DID KNOW HER, AND YOU BROKE UP. FRIENDS CLAIM RICK LARKIN TRIED TO RECONCILE WITH AMBER OLSEN JUST BEFORE THE MURDERS. WE'LL STAY HERE UNTIL I GET AN ANSWER. BUT SHE WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM. YOU'RE AWFUL NERVOUS FOR NOT KNOWING ANYTHING. Macdonald: THIS TIPSTER SAID HE WOULD BE CRAZY EMOTIONAL, SAYING HE WANTED TO DO BODILY HARM TO THIS EX-GIRLFRIEND OF HIS, AND THEN THE NEXT MOMENT, WOULD JUST, "OH, NO. I LOVE HER, I LOVE HER." SO, HIS EMOTIONS WERE UP AND DOWN. HE SEEMED VERY UNSTABLE. HE WASN'T FILLING IN ANY OF THE GAPS FOR POLICE. [ BELL RINGS ] Narrator: SO, WHO OWNS THE MYSTERIOUS BIKE POLICE TRACED TO THE ALASKA PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE? I DIDN'T KNOW IF THE GUY WAS AN EMPLOYEE OR A PATIENT. COULD BE A DOCTOR, COULD BE A PSYCH TECH, SOMEBODY WHO WORK AT A.P.I., AND SOMEBODY THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE PARK AT THE TIME AND SAW SOMETHING. Narrator: A VISIT TO A.P.I. REVEALS THAT LARKIN ISN'T THE OWNER OF THE BIKE. THE BIKE IS REGISTERED TO A PATIENT, A TALL, DARK-HAIRED MAN NAMED CHARLES MEACH, WHO'S BEEN HOSPITALIZED FOR THE LAST DECADE. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHY HE WAS IN THERE, BUT THE FACT THAT HE WAS A PATIENT AT A MENTAL INSTITUTION DEFINITELY INCREASED OUR INTEREST. HI. GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE YOU? GOOD, HOW ARE YOU? MEACH MADE HIS WAY TO ALASKA IN 1973, ON THE RUN FROM A TROUBLED PAST OF DRUG-AND-ALCOHOL-RELATED OFFENSES. Gruenstein: A LOT OF PEOPLE COME UP HERE FOR THE ADVENTURE. SOME OTHER PEOPLE COME UP HERE 'CAUSE THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT ANYPLACE ELSE. SOME PEOPLE CAME UP HERE TO ESCAPE. Narrator: BUT INVESTIGATORS ARE SURPRISED TO FIND MANY AT A.P.I. DESCRIBE MEACH AS THE SANEST PATIENT IN THE HOSPITAL. Barbara: MOST OF THE PATIENTS TEND TO BE A LITTLE SLOPPY, NOT REALLY TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES. BUT CHARLIE WAS VERY FASTIDIOUS, AND HIS HAIR WAS ALWAYS NEATLY GROOMED AND TRIMMED AND CUT, YOU KNOW. HE STOOD OUT AS BEING ALMOST MORE NORMAL. WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE PARK MURDERS, MEACH TELLS DETECTIVES THERE IS NO WAY HE COULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED. HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC NIGHT? I'M JUST SURE I WAS HERE. NOW POLICE HAVE TWO VIABLE SUSPECTS. AMBER OLSEN'S JEALOUS EX-LOVER, WHO'S REFUSING TO TALK... ...AND A MAN IN A PSYCH WARD WHO APPEARS TO BE A MODEL PATIENT... BUT IS HE? Kasper: IT STARTED CLICKING FOR ME. WE WERE ONTO SOMETHING, BECAUSE THIS GUY IS IN HERE ON A COMMITTAL, NOT BECAUSE OF HIS OWN VOLITION. [ FILM REEL CLICKING ] Narrator: IN MARCH, 1973, MEACH MET A 22-YEAR OLD BOX BOY AT THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE IN ANCHORAGE. IT'S COLD OUT. IT'S VERY COLD. MEACH SINGLED HIM OUT FOR WHATEVER SICK REASON HE HAD. Narrator: HE COERCED HIM TO EARTHQUAKE PARK. OUT OF NOWHERE, MEACH ATTACKED. LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING. [ GRUNTING ] THE SMALL-FRAMED BOX BOY WAS NO MATCH FOR A MAN WHO STOOD MORE THAN SIX FEET TALL. Gruenstein: HE BRUTALLY KILLED THIS KID BY FIST AND BY FEET, BY KICKING HIM TO DEATH, AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON. Narrator: MEACH ULTIMATELY CONFESSED, AND WAS CHARGED WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. BUT BEFORE TRIAL, PSYCHIATRISTS DIAGNOSED HIM WITH PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA. [ FILM REEL STOPS ] HE WAS FOUND NOT GUILTY, BY REASON OF INSANITY, AND SENT TO A MENTAL INSTITUTION IN CALIFORNIA. HE VIRTUALLY LACKED CAPACITY TO SYMPATHIZE WITH OTHER PEOPLE, PROBLEMS, PREDICAMENTS, BECAUSE HE WAS SO CONSUMED BY HIS OWN. BUT HE WAS CLEARLY CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING RIGHT FROM WRONG. HE TRIED HARD TO CONFORM TO THE RULES, BUT THERE WERE TIMES WHEN HE COULDN'T CONCEAL HIS DARK SIDE, LIKE WHEN HE DREW A PORTRAIT OF PRESIDENT CARTER'S WIFE. NURSE, LET ME SHOW YOU THE PICTURE I DREW. Barbara: HE SHOWED ME THIS DRAWING THAT HE HAD DONE OF ROSALYNN CARTER, AND IT WAS SPOT ON. I MEAN IT LOOKED SO MUCH LIKE HER, AND IT WAS ALL DONE IN PENCIL. BUT IT HAD LITTLE CRACKS, ALL THROUGH HER FACE. DO YOU MIND IF I HOLD ON TO THIS FOR A WHILE. SURE. Mason: WHEN I SAW IT HAD A LOT OF LITTLE TINY LINES DRAWN ALL THE WAY THROUGH IT, INDICATING A CRACKED SKULL. [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ] Narrator: AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY TIME MEACH TRANSFORMED FROM DR. JEKYLL TO MR. HYDE. Barbara: WE HAD BEEN UP IN THE ART CLASS, AND SOMETHING HAPPENED IN ONE OF THE UNITS AND THE AIDES HAD TO RUN TO HELP OUT. SO THAT LEFT CHARLIE AND ME. WE GOT ON THE ELEVATOR, AND I PUSHED THE BUTTON TO HIS FLOOR, AND I LOOKED UP AND HE HAD THIS WEIRD SMILE ON HIS FACE. [ PEN CLICKING ] I COULD JUST FEEL MY KNEES WERE SHAKING. KNOCK IT OFF, CHARLES. [ ELEVATOR BELL DINGS ] AND HE SMILED AND STEPPED BACK. IT WAS THAT SMILE, THAT KIND OF, LIKE... SINISTER, ALMOST SINISTER SMILE THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN WITH CHARLIE BEFORE. BUT HE JUST SCARED THE DAYLIGHTS OUT OF ME. Narrator: CHARLES MEACH WAS LOCKED UP. IT SEEMED VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE COULD HAVE ESCAPED TO KILL AGAIN. HAVE A NICE DAY. Narrator: ANCHORAGE POLICE NARROW THEIR LEADS IN THE SEARCH FOR THE GUNMAN BEHIND THE BRUTAL PARK SLAYINGS. AFTER CONSIDERABLE PRESSURE FROM POLICE, AMBER OLSEN'S EX-BOYFRIEND BREAKS HIS SILENCE. ALL RIGHT. Kasper: MY PARTNER WALKED IN, AND THE KID RECOGNIZED HIM. HE SAID, "HEY, I KNOW YOU. I USED TO CUT YOUR MOM'S LAWN." HE SAID, "THOSE GUYS MADE ME MAD AND I WASN'T GONNA TALK TO THEM." BUT HE TOLD US WHERE HE WAS, AND WE WERE PRETTY ASSURED THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. I WAS JUST TOO SCARED TO SAY ANYTHING. Narrator: THAT LEAVES AUTHORITIES WITH ONLY ONE POSSIBLE SUSPECT, CHARLES MEACH. BUT HOW HAD A CONFESSED KILLER MANAGED TO BREAK OUT OF THE ASYLUM UNNOTICED? IN THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION WHERE HE WAS INITIALLY HOUSED, MEACH WAS SMART ENOUGH TO BEAT THE SYSTEM BY TELLING HIS DOCTORS WHAT THEY WANTED TO HEAR. I THINK I'M DOING PRETTY WELL. Macdonald: SO, HE WAS SENT BACK TO ANCHORAGE. THEY PUT HIM AT THE ALASKA PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE. HE PROGRESSED FURTHER. Narrator: MEACH USES THE KNOWLEDGE HE GAINED IN CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE HIS CHARADE AT A.P.I. Mason: HE KNEW BETTER THAN TO TALK ABOUT HIS VOICES, OR ABOUT HIS DELUSIONS. SO, ON THE SURFACE, HE LOOKED VERY FRIENDLY AND PEACEFUL, AND NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF. THEY'RE VERY PERSUASIVE, VERY CHARMING, YOU KNOW, THE TED BUNDY TYPE, THAT KIND OF THING, CHARLIE MANSON, YOU KNOW, THEY CAN CON THE PANTS OFF OF YOU, REALLY. Gruenstein: HE HAD A HIGH IQ -- 120, 125, IN THAT CATEGORY. HE'D STUDY HOW TO BE INTIMIDATING. HE WAS CLEVERLY INTIMIDATING, CLEVERLY MANIPULATING. HE CONVINCED A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF FAIRLY SMART PEOPLE, A LOT OF RELATIVELY WELL-TRAINED PEOPLE, THAT HE WAS MUCH HEALTHIER THAN HE WAS. Narrator: BUT DR. MASON ROBISON, THE SUPERINTENDENT AT A.P.I., RECOGNIZES SOMETHING MORE SINISTER AT PLAY. OFF MEDICATIONS, HE'D BE QUITE PSYCHOTIC. THE REAL CHARLES MEACH, THE MONSTER INSIDE, WOULD GRADUALLY EMERGE. HE'D HAVE THESE FANTASIES OF MURDER, AND THEY WERE PRETTY MUCH A PART OF HIS MIND-SET ALL THE TIME. HE ALSO HAD A PLAN, AT ONE POINT, OF KILLING ONE OF THE STAFF MEMBERS AT A.P.I., AND COOKING THEM, AND INVITING OTHER STAFF MEMBERS TO COME JOIN IN THE MEAL. Narrator: DR. ROBISON ISSUES A STERN WARNING. Mason: I TOLD THE STAFF THAT I THINK THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN AT A.P.I., AND PROBABLY THE MOST DANGEROUS IN THE STATE OF ALASKA. SHOULD NOT EVER BE LET OUT, NEVER. I DOCUMENTED THAT, AND TWO MONTHS LATER, I LEFT. Narrator: BUT SOON AFTER, DESPITE DR. ROBISON'S WARNING, MEACH IS GRANTED LEAVE PRIVILEGES, ABLE TO COME AND GO AS HE PLEASES, UP TO 10 HOURS A DAY. Petterson: HE WAS FREE TO DO WHAT HE WANTED TO DO. TO GO WHERE HE WANTED TO GO. SUPPOSEDLY, IMMENSELY ILL PATIENT, AND HE'S MINGLING WITH THE PUBLIC AFTER COMMITTING MURDER. PEOPLE WERE UP IN ARMS OVER THIS, HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN? HOW COULD SOMEONE SO DANGEROUS BE ALLOWED OUT ON THE STREET? Narrator: WITH NO ONE KEEPING TABS ON HIM, HE STOPS TAKING HIS MEDS... AND MAKES AN OMINOUS PURCHASE THROUGH THE CLASSIFIED ADS. HE BOUGHT TWO GUNS, AND HE HAD THEM HIDDEN IN THE PARK ACROSS FROM THE INSTITUTION. HIS PERSONALITY WAS SUCH THAT HE FELT INADEQUATE, AND A GUN GAVE HIM A SENSE OF POWER. KNOWING HE'S IN VIOLATION OF THE RULES, HE PAYS A STRANGER $20 TO PURCHASE AMMUNITION FOR HIM. Grimes: YOU KNOW, EVEN AFTER HE DID TIME, A CONVICTED FELON COULD NEVER ACTUALLY OWN A GUN. BUT HE WAS NOT A CONVICTED FELON, HE WAS NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY. I WAS RIGHT HERE. Narrator: WHEN FIRST QUESTIONED BY POLICE, MEACH DENIES ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE PARK MURDERS. HE SAYS HE WAS WENT TO THE DEPARTMENT STORE WHERE HE WORKED, BUT WASN'T GONE LONG. FIRST, I BELIEVE A.P.I. KEEPS A LOG HERE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLOWED TO LEAVE OR HAVE LEFT. WE DO HAVE IT. COULD YOU GET THAT LOG FOR ME, PLEASE? SURE, I'LL GET THAT FOR YOU. OUTSIDE THE NURSE'S PRESENCE, MEACH ADMITS THERE'S MORE TO HIS STORY. YOU GUYS KEEP A SECRET? SURE. SURE, YEAH. HE KIND OF LEANED OVER, AND HE ASKED, HE SAID, "CAN YOU GUYS KEEP A SECRET?" AND WE SAID, "SURE." AND HE SAID, "I WENT OUT AND I HAD SOME DRINKS AND I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO." HE SAYS, "YOU GUYS WON'T TELL THE DOCTOR, WILL YA?" HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT, THAT THE DOCTORS WOULD FIND OUT. BECAUSE WHEN I DRINK I GET MYSELF INTO TROUBLE. I SAID, "WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE ASKING YOU THESE QUESTIONS?" AND HE KIND OF LEANED FORWARD AND SAYS, "YEAH, IT WAS ABOUT THOSE KIDS IN THE PARK. IT WASN'T A PRETTY SIGHT, WAS IT?" AND HE KIND OF SMILED AT ME. AND THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK STOOD UP, AND I KNEW WE HAD JUST TALKED TO THE MURDERER. Narrator: THREE DAYS LATER, MEACH FINALLY CONFESSES TO HIS PSYCHIATRIST. [ FILM REEL CLICKING ] HE ADMITS ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDERS, HE WOKE TO A BAD DAY. HE HAD A SHIRT, A NEW SHIRT, AND IT WAS STOLEN FROM HIM. SO, IT WAS HIS MISSION THAT NIGHT TO STEAL SOMETHING FROM SOMEBODY ELSE, KIND OF GET EVEN, GET SOME REVENGE. HE BEGAN UNRAVELING. SON OF A BITCH! [ YELLS, PANTING ] Narrator: FURTHER FUMING OVER THE FACT THAT A JUDGE HAD JUST BLOCKED HIS RELEASE, HE LEFT ON HIS BIKE AROUND NOON. HE STOPPED AT A STRIP CLUB, AND SHARED A COUPLE OF PITCHERS OF BEER WITH SOME SERVICE MEN. THEN, TRIED TO GET FRIENDLY WITH A DANCER. HE HAD GONE DOWN THAT DAY TO THE WILD CHERRY, AND HAD BOUGHT A DRINK FOR THE YOUNG LADY, AND STARTED TO TOUCH HER, AND APPARENTLY SHE SLAPPED HIM AND REJECTED HIM. GET OFF ME. Narrator: MEACH STORMED OUT OF THE BAR AND RODE TO HIS SECRET HIDING PLACE. HE HAD PICKED UP HIS GUN AND WOUND UP IN THE AREA, THE TENT, OF COURSE, DETERMINED THAT THE KIDS WERE NOT THERE. GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO STEAL. BUT, OF COURSE, WHAT HE DIDN'T KNOW IS THAT ALL FOUR OF THE KIDS WERE OUT OF SIGHT, BUT NEARBY. HE WASN'T PLANNING ON MURDER. HE WAS PLANNING ON STEALING, AND THEN WHEN HE WAS DISCOVERED... [ GUNSHOT ] ...HE HAD NO CONSCIENCE. KILLING FOUR KIDS BECAME NECESSARY. THERE WAS NOTHING STOPPING CHARLES MEACH FROM DOING WHAT HE HAD TO DO BECAUSE HE COULD CARE LESS ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE'S LIFE. IT WAS HIS LIFE THAT HE CARED ABOUT. [ GUNSHOT ] THIS ISN'T FUNNY, REALLY. WHERE ARE Y'ALL? [ SCREAMS ] [ GUNSHOT ] Girl: GUYS? [ SCREAMS ] [ GUNSHOT ] AFTER THE MURDERS, HE QUICKLY FLED THE SCENE. Kasper: HE REPLACED HIS GUN, IN ITS HIDING PLACE, AND WENT BACK TO THE INSTITUTION... AS NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. Narrator: MEACH IS LATER IDENTIFIED AS THE GUNMAN BY SEVERAL PARK GOERS. HE'S CHARGED WITH FOUR COUNTS OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. DURING THE TRIAL THE FOLLOWING DECEMBER, CHARLES MEACH PLEADS NOT GUILTY BY REASON OF INSANITY A SECOND TIME. THE VOICES IN MY HEAD SAID IT WAS OKAY. Narrator: HE LATER ASKS A PSYCHIATRIST WHETHER HE SHOULD ACT CRAZY DURING PROCEEDINGS. I HONESTLY THINK HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING BECAUSE HE HAD THAT GUN APPARENTLY HIDDEN SOMEWHERE. HE'D GONE AND RETRIEVED IT, LOADED IT. YEAH, PLAIN AND SIMPLE, COLD-BLOODED. CHARLES MEACH IS FOUND GUILTY ON ALL FOUR COUNTS. HE'S SENTENCED TO 396 YEARS IN PRISON. IN THE END, THE CASE PROMPTS ALASKA TO CHANGE ITS LAWS. A CRIMINALLY INSANE PERSON DEEMED HEALTHY WHILE INSTITUTIONALIZED, NOW MUST SERVE THE REMAINDER OF THE SENTENCE BEHIND BARS. HE KNEW THE STEPS TO TAKE. HE KNEW HOW TO MOSTLY COVER HIS BUTT. HE TOOK STEPS TO PREVENT BEING CAUGHT. HE WASN'T CRAZY. CHARLES MEACH DIED IN 2004, INSIDE THE COLD CONCRETE CONFINES OF A PRISON CELL, A PLACE, MANY ARGUE, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALL ALONG. FREEDOM WAS THE FIRST MISTAKE. HE IS EVIL, HE IS EVIL PERSONIFIED. HE IS DANGEROUS. HE IS INTIMIDATING, AND HE'S A TOTAL PSYCHOPATH.
