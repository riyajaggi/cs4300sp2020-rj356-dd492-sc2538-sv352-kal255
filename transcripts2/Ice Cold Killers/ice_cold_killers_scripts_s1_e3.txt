 Ice Cold Killers (2012–…): Season 1, Episode 3 - Mountain Man - full transcript 
 North of Anchorage is the backwoods brush of Chulitna - a wild country and sportsman's paradise - the perfect spot for whitewater rafting, panning for gold, fishing - and murder. When a vacationing couple fails to return to work after the holiday weekend, state troopers discover they are the victims of cold-blooded murder. Authorities suspect Paul Stavenjord, a mountain man with a colorful past, but Stavenjord goes on the run, sending troopers on an intense manhunt in the dense Alaskan brush.

 [ WOLF HOWLS ] >> Narrator: THE WILDS OF ALASKA ARE A VAST AND UNTAMED FRONTIER. >> ALASKA IS ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING, BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE YOUR GUARD UP AT ALL TIMES. THERE'S A RAZOR-THIN LINE BETWEEN SAFETY AND PERIL. >> Narrator: IN THE RUGGED WILDERNESS, A MOUNTAIN MAN'S DARK DESIRES TAKE ROOT...

AND ON ONE DAY, HE WAS WILLING TO CARRY THOSE OUT. >> Narrator:...LEAVING ALASKA STATE TROOPERS SCRAMBLING TO HUNT DOWN A SURVIVALIST BEFORE HE STRIKES AGAIN. >> VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND HIM, AND FIND HIM FAST.

 CHULITNA. >> CHULITNA, ALASKA, IS NOT ACTUALLY A CITY OR A VILLAGE. IT'S A RAILROAD STOP OF A SORT. IT'S A PLACE WITH A NAME ON A MAP. >> Narrator: THE FEW WHO CALL THIS UNTAMED WILDERNESS HOME RELY ON THEIR OWN RESOURCES, CARRYING IN SUPPLIES BY 4- WHEELER OR SNOW MACHINE. >> THE REASON PEOPLE PICK THESE CABINS IS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T GET THERE ANY OTHER WAY EXCEPT BY THE RAILROAD, BY FOOT, OR BY AN ATV, 4-WHEELER. >> IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE TO IMAGINE WHAT LIFE IN RURAL ALASKA, A PLACE LIKE CHULITNA, IS LIKE. IMAGINE YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR OWN FOOD, YOUR OWN FIREWOOD, YOUR OWN FUEL FOR VARIOUS MACHINES, YOUR GENERATOR. YOU HAVE TO PREPARE YOURSELF FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT CONTACT WITH HUMANITY. >> Narrator: THE WINTERS HERE ARE RUGGED. BUT THE SPRING THAW EXPOSES A PICTURE-PERFECT PARADISE. [ WOLF GROWLS ] [ WOLF HOWLS ] HOWEVER, FOR DON TIDWELL, THE SPRING OF 1997 WAS ANYTHING BUT PERFECT. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] JUST AFTER MEMORIAL DAY, HE GETS AN ALARMING PHONE CALL. HIS SISTER, DEBBIE, WHO SPENT THE LONG WEEKEND AT HER CABIN IN CHULITNA, DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR WORK. >> THAT WAS UNLIKE HER, 'CAUSE SHE HAD A RADIO PHONE. SHE COULD HAVE CALLED. THIS WAS, LIKE, 9:00 IN THE MORNING. SO, FOR HER NOT TO SHOW UP OR CALL -- YOU KNOW, SHE DIDN'T START, I THINK, TILL 8:00. SO SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THANKS FOR CALLING. >> Narrator: DON KNEW DEBBIE AND HER HUSBAND HAD PLANNED A WEEKEND GETAWAY, AND HE COULDN'T SHAKE THE THOUGHT THAT THE REMOTE WILDERNESS MAY HAVE PROVEN TOO MIGHTY A MATCH, EVEN FOR A VIETNAM VETERAN LIKE HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW. >> MY MAIN THOUGHT WAS THEY HAD A BAD BEAR ENCOUNTER. THAT WAS THE ONLY THING THAT I COULD THINK OF. >> Narrator: DESPERATE FOR ANSWERS, DON CONTACTS HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW RICK'S BOSS, ONLY TO LEARN HE, TOO IS ABSENT FROM WORK THAT DAY. >> I JUST HAD THIS BLACK CLOUD OVER ME -- THIS EERIE FEELING, YOU KNOW? AND I COULDN'T EXPLAIN IT. I MEAN, IT'S A FEELING UP YOUR BACKBONE THAT... THERE'S NO EXPLANATION FOR IT. I JUST -- I WAS WORRIED TO DEATH. [ LIQUID SPLASHES ] >> [ SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] >> Narrator: RICK BEERY, A 48-YEAR-OLD ELECTRICIAN, HEADED TO THE CABIN ON THURSDAY. HIS 40-YEAR-OLD WIFE, DEBBIE, A CUSTOMER-SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE FOR A UTILITY COMPANY, DROVE UP FROM THEIR HOME IN BIG LAKE TO MEET HIM THE FOLLOWING DAY. >> THEY LIVED THERE AND LOVED THERE, BECAUSE IT WAS A LIFESTYLE WHERE THEY WOULDN'T BE INTERRUPTED BY A TELEPHONE, WHERE THERE WAS NO TELEVISION. >> [ LAUGHS ] >> THEY'D PUT ALL THEIR STUFF TOGETHER AND GO UP TO CHULITNA ON THE WEEKEND. AND IT JUST BECAME A REAL PART OF THEIR FAMILY CULTURE. >> THAT WAS GONNA BE THEIR RETIREMENT HOME. THEY PLANNED TO MOVE THERE AND LIVE THERE FOR MOST OF THE YEAR. THEY LIVED A LOT OF THE FRONTIER LIFESTYLE, ATE MOOSE MEAT, SALMON. THEY -- DEBORAH LIKED GROWING A NICE GARDEN AND STUFF. >> Narrator: IN 1983, FRIENDS INTRODUCED DEBBIE TO RICK. THE LIFELONG BACHELOR FELL HARD FOR THE RED-HAIRED BEAUTY. DEBBIE WAS EQUALLY AS SMITTEN. >> THEY HAD THAT KIND OF ENERGY BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM A LOT. YOU JUST CAN KIND OF FEEL IT. IT'S KIND OF PALPABLE AND TOUCHABLE. YOU CAN ALMOST POUR IT INTO A MEASURING GLASS AND MEASURE IT AND LOOK AT IT. WONDERFUL TO BE AROUND. YOU KIND OF WANTED SOME OF THAT. >> Narrator: HOURS AFTER LEARNING HIS SISTER DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR WORK, DON TIDWELL ARRIVES AT THE CABIN IN CHULITNA... AND FINDS THINGS SEEMINGLY OUT OF SORTS. >> DEB? RICK? ANYBODY HOME? THEIR CABIN WAS JUST LIKE SOMEBODY HAD WALKED OUT. THERE'S A BEER ON THE TABLE, CHEESE AND CRACKERS LAID OUT LIKE HE HAD JUST WALKED OUT. THEY WERE GOOD HOUSEKEEPERS AND STUFF. HE WOULDN'T LEAVE A BEER ON THE TABLE, AND CHEESE AND CRACKERS OUT, AND THEN JUST NOT EVER COME BACK. >> Narrator: DON ALSO NOTES THAT THE COUPLE'S TWO DOGS APPEAR AGITATED AND UNEASY. >> THEY HAD BEEN IN THE CABIN SO LONG THAT THEY HAD DEFECATED ON THE FLOOR, AND THESE DOGS WERE VERY WELL-RAISED. THERE'S NO WAY THAT THEY WOULD HAVE DID THIS ON THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN UNLESS THEY WERE TRAPPED IN THERE FOR HOURS ON END. >> Narrator: KNOWING IT'S TOO SOON TO FILE A MISSING PERSON'S REPORT, DON SEARCHES FOR CLUES AND WAITS ANXIOUSLY. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, THERE IS STILL NO WORD. >> I WAS AT MY WIT'S END, YOU KNOW? LOOKING AROUND, AND THERE'S JUST NO EXPLANATION FOR WHY OR WHERE RICK AND DEB IS. >> Narrator: AS DAWN BREAKS, DON DECIDES TO CONDUCT HIS OWN SEARCH. HE SCOURS THE AREA AROUND THE CABIN BUT COMES UP EMPTY. HE THEN DECIDES TO LOOK DOWN BY THE CREEK WHERE RICK AND DEBBIE LIKED TO FISH. HE'S STARTLED BY THE SIGHT OF RICK'S 4-WHEELER IN THE WATER. >> I CALLED THE TROOPERS, AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, "I KNOW THAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT 48 HOURS..." RICK! "...BUT I BELIEVE SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED LONGER THAN 48 HOURS, 'CAUSE THEIR 4-WHEELER'S IN THE CREEK." [ SIREN WAILS ] >> Narrator: ALASKA STATE TROOPERS IMMEDIATELY LAUNCH THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION, COMBING A 2-MILE RADIUS AROUND THE COUPLE'S CABIN. WITHIN HOURS, THEY MAKE AN UNSETTLING FIND -- THE BODY OF RICK BEERY. >> 322, I HAVE A 107. I NEED UNITS TO RESPOND TO MY LOCATION HERE. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] >> EXCUSE ME, SIR. EXCUSE ME, SIR! EXCUSE ME, SIR. YOU CANNOT COME IN HERE. >> I THINK THAT'S MY BROTHER-IN-LAW. >> OKAY, I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT YOU CANNOT COME IN. >> MY SISTER'S STILL MISSING. AND BY THE TIME I MET THEM DOWN THERE, THEY HAD RICK IN A BODY BAG. MY MAIN THOUGHT WAS THEY HAD A BAD BEAR ENCOUNTER, 'CAUSE IT WAS SPRINGTIME, YOU KNOW, AND THEY'RE ALL STARTING TO COME OUT OF THEIR DENS. >> I NEED YOU TO GO TO YOUR CABIN RIGHT NOW. >> Narrator: TROOPERS QUICKLY SURMISED THAT RICK MET WITH SOMETHING FAR MORE SINISTER THAN MOTHER NATURE. >> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CASE FACTS, AS THE TROOPERS FIRST FOUND THEM, THIS MAN'S 4- WHEELER'S IN THE WATER AND A SINGLE GUNSHOT WOUND TO THE HEAD -- THINGS INDICATIVE OF MURDER. >> Narrator: IT LOOKS LIKE RICK WAS SHOT AT POINTBLANK RANGE AND NEVER SAW IT COMING. EVEN MORE TROUBLING, DEBBIE AND HER RED 4-WHEELER ARE NOWHERE TO BE FOUND. >> IT APPEARED HE'D BEEN MURDERED, AND THE WIFE WAS MISSING. WAS SHE A VICTIM? OR IS THIS A LOVER'S SPAT? DID SHE KILL HER HUSBAND, THEN FLEE AND TAKE OFF AFTER THAT HAPPENED? >> IT TAKES A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE, OF COURSE, AT THAT TIME. NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FOUL-PLAY ASPECT OF IT. AND WHERE DO WE GO FROM THERE? THE WORLD IS OPEN TO YOU AT THAT POINT IN TIME. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] >> Narrator: IN THE REMOTE ALASKAN WILDERNESS, SOME 200 MILES FROM CIVILIZATION, A CHILLING DISCOVERY LEAVES STATE TROOPERS GRASPING FOR ANSWERS. THE BODY OF RICK BEERY IS FOUND IN A CREEK JUST 2 MILES FROM HIS BACKWOODS CABIN. HE HAS BEEN SHOT EXECUTION-STYLE. >> I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE COULD BE DEAD. I WAS SUPPOSED TO DIE BEFORE HIM. [ CHUCKLES ] THAT WASN'T OKAY. >> Narrator: TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, THERE IS NO SIGN OF RICK'S WIFE, DEBBIE, OR HER RED 4- WHEELER. THE ODD SCENARIO PAINTS HER AS A LIKELY SUSPECT IN THE EYES OF POLICE. HAD SHE AND RICK HAD A LOVER'S SPAT? MIGHT SHE HAVE LEFT CHULITNA TO COOL OFF? >> [ CHUCKLES ] >> Narrator: OR WAS IT SOMETHING MORE SINISTER? MIGHT DEBBIE HAVE KILLED HER HUSBAND IN ORDER TO BE WITH SOMEONE ELSE? >> WE KEEP NARROWING THAT FOCUS DOWN IN TERMS OF WHERE THAT INVESTIGATION WOULD LEAD. WE STILL HAVE A MISSING PERSON. NO INDICATION THAT THERE'S ANY PROBLEMS BETWEEN RICK AND DEBORAH, BUT YOU DON'T RULE ANYTHING OUT AT THAT POINT IN TIME EITHER. >> THERE WAS ALL OF THESE INTERESTING PIECES OF INFORMATION. I MEAN, THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, A BAZILLION MAYBES. >> TELL ME WHY YOU CALLED ME HERE. >> Narrator: BUT THE COUPLE'S FAMILY INSISTS DEBBIE WOULD HAVE NEVER CAUSED HER HUSBAND HARM. >> I CHECKED THE CABIN. I KNEW SOMETHING HAD TO HAVE HAPPENED TO DEB. YOU KNOW, RICK WAS DEB'S SAVIOR, AND I KNEW SOMEBODY HAD TO HAVE KILLED THEM. AND I WAS SURE THAT HE WAS PROBABLY TRYING TO PROTECT DEB, SO I WAS WORRIED TO DEATH ABOUT MY SISTER. >> Narrator: POLICE ARE MET WITH AS MANY QUESTIONS AS FAMILY MEMBERS. RICK HAD BEEN GUNNED DOWN ALONG THE ONLY PASS IN AND OUT OF CHULITNA. MIGHT SOMEONE HAVE STALKED HIM? HAD HE BEEN THE ONLY TARGET? OR HAD DEBBIE MET THE SAME FATE? DESPERATE TO FIND DEBBIE ALIVE, POLICE SET UP A DRAGNET AND FIRST QUESTIONED ELECTRICAL WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN INSTALLING CABLE ALONG THE RAILROAD TRACKS NEAR THE CREEK WHERE RICK'S BODY WAS FOUND. THEY TELL TROOPERS THEY NOTICED RICK'S 4-WHEELER IN THE CREEK ON BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY BUT THAT IT HAD BEEN PULLED OUT TO DRY LAND WHEN THEY PASSED BY AGAIN ON TUESDAY. THE WORKERS ALSO SAY THEY HEARD GUNSHOTS BEING FIRED FROM A NEARBY CAMPSITE. AND THEY RECALL THE ENCAMPMENT BEING MARKED BY A DISTURBING MAKESHIFT FLAG -- A PAIR OF WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR. >> CERTAINLY, SOMEBODY WHO IS IN THE AREA, SHOOTING OFF A.22 AND HANGING WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR IN THE TREES, BECOMES SOMEBODY THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR WHEN THERE'S A WOMAN MISSING AND YOU BELIEVE FOUL PLAY, FOR SURE. >> Narrator: DAYS LATER, AUTHORITIES GET A LUCKY BREAK WHEN THE MYSTERY CAMPER COMES FORWARD. 21-YEAR-OLD GAVIN SAYHAW TELLS POLICE HE BECAME LOST AND WAS HEADING TOWARD SOME SMOKE FROM A CABIN WHEN HE GOT TIRED AND PITCHED CAMP. HE SLEPT JUST YARDS FROM RICK'S CORPSE BUT CLAIMS HE NEVER NOTICED THE BODY. >> HIS GOAL WAS NOT TO CAMP THERE AT THAT CREEK. HIS GOAL WAS A GOOD FISHING RIVER SOME, I THINK, 4 OR 5 MORE MILES FURTHER DOWN THE TRACKS. BUT HE GAVE UP AND STOPPED RIGHT THERE NEAR THAT CREEK TO PITCH HIS LITTLE CAMP ON A LITTLE SPOT OF GROUND, UNBEKNOWNST TO HIM THAT HE'S CAMPED RIGHT AT A MURDER SCENE. THIS KID CAME ALONG AND CAMPED RIGHT THERE AND EVEN PUT UP A FLAG [Chuckling] TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT HE WAS THERE. >> Narrator: AND HE TELLS POLICE HE FOUND SOME OF RICK'S BELONGINGS. >> HE FOUND THE SUBMERGED 4- WHEELER BELONGING TO RICK IN THE CREEK... AND WENT DOWN AND SALVAGED SOME SOFT DRINKS, I BELIEVE, AND MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE OUT OF THE SADDLEBAGS THAT WERE ON THE 4- WHEELER. >> Narrator: SAYHAW CLAIMS HE HELPED HIMSELF TO A SODA AND A PIECE OF GUM. WHEN PRESSED FURTHER, HE'S EMBARRASSED TO ADMIT HE HUNG A PAIR OF HIS GIRLFRIEND'S PANTIES AT THE CAMPSITE. >> HE WAS SOMEWHAT ASHAMED, BUT HE DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT WAS HIM THAT DID IT AS A PRACTICAL JOKE. >> NOW, HE PRESENTED A NUMBER OF INTERESTING CIRCUMSTANCES. CERTAINLY, HE PICKED THE WRONG PLACE TO PITCH HIS CAMP AT THE WRONG TIME. >> Narrator: BUT TROOPERS FIND NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST SAYHAW WAS INVOLVED IN RICK'S DEATH OR DEBBIE'S DISAPPEARANCE. AT A LOSS FOR LEADS, AUTHORITIES DECIDE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK INTO RICK AND DEBBIE'S PAST. THEY LEARNED THAT DEBBIE HAD SOUGHT REFUGE IN ALASKA AFTER A BITTER DIVORCE. MEETING RICK GAVE HER A NEW START. >> HE WANTED SOMEONE TO COOK HIM A GOOD MEAL AND BE WITH HIM AND KEEP HIM COMPANY AND READ TOGETHER IN THE EVENING, AND IT WASN'T EASY TO FIND SOMEBODY LIKE THAT, OR HE FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT. OF COURSE, A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO WITH WHERE HE WAS LOOKING. [ CHUCKLES ] BUT, ANYWAY, THEY JUST FOUND EACH OTHER. AND I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GOD THINGS THAT SHE WOUND UP IN THAT SAME AREA THAT HE WAS. >> [ LAUGHS ] >> Narrator: THE TWO DIDN'T DATE LONG BEFORE RICK'S RENEGADE NATURE PUT THEIR ROMANCE TO THE TEST. >> YOU JUST CAN'T FIGHT THE IRS AND THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, BUT HE SEEMED TO THINK HE COULD. IT WASN'T THAT HE WAS UNWILLING TO PAY HIS INCOME TAX. HE DID PAY INCOME TAX. BUT HE WAS UNWILLING TO PAY ANYTHING MORE THAN WHAT THE TAX CODE SAID HE WAS SUPPOSED TO DO, SO THAT'S WHAT HE WENT TO JAIL FOR. >> HE ENDED UP DOING 10, 11 MONTHS IN JAIL 'CAUSE HE DISAGREED WITH THE IRS. HE WAS VERY STUBBORN IN THAT ASPECT. >> YOU LOOK GREAT THIS MORNING. >> Narrator: BUT DEBBIE WEATHERED THE STORM, AND THE TWO EVENTUALLY WED. >> SHE WOULD GO UP AND VISIT HIM EVERY OTHER WEEKEND. I GUESS THAT PROVED TO RICK THAT, "HEY, THIS LITTLE GAL -- SHE'S A KEEPER." >> Narrator: RICK'S RUN-IN WITH THE LAW RAISES SUSPICIONS. POLICE QUESTION WHETHER RICK MAY HAVE HAD A BEEF WITH AN OLD CELLMATE. MAYBE SOMEONE HAD PROMISED TO GET EVEN WITH HIM ON THE OUTSIDE. AS AUTHORITIES SCRAMBLE TO TRACK THE KILLER, SEARCHERS CONTINUE TO COMB THE RUGGED TERRAIN FOR ANY SIGN OF DEBBIE. >> THE THING THAT WORRIED ME ABOUT NOT FINDING DEBBIE IS THAT EITHER SHE WAS BEING TORTURED SOMEWHERE OR THAT SHE WAS TIED UP AND BEING HURT. >> Narrator: SEVEN DAYS AFTER DISCOVERING RICK BEERY'S BODY, INVESTIGATORS SCOURED THE THICK UNDERBRUSH ALONG THE CREEK... AND LEARNED FIRSTHAND WHAT REALLY BECAME OF DEBBIE. >> AND THE OFFICER NOTICED SOMETHING THAT WAS OUT OF THE ORDINARY, AND AS THEY INVESTIGATED FURTHER, THAT'S WHEN THEY FOUND HER BODY. >> 322, I HAVE A 107 AT MY LOCATION. >> Narrator: HER BODY IS BURIED BENEATH GRASS AND TREE LIMBS. >> HER CLOTHES WERE PARTIALLY REMOVED. SHE WAS LYING ON HER PANTS AND HER PANTIES. THERE WAS SOME SEMEN AT THE SCENE. >> Narrator: AN AUTOPSY REVEALS EVEN MORE DISTURBING DETAILS. >> NOT ONLY WAS SEMEN PRESENT, BUT THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CONTUSIONS, ABRASIONS, AND OTHER FINDINGS NOT INDICATIVE OF CONSENSUAL SEX. SO, SHE WAS SHOT TO DEATH, SIMILAR OR IDENTICAL TO HER HUSBAND. >> Narrator: AND THERE WAS ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THE KILLER MAY HAVE HAD SEX WITH DEBBIE'S CORPSE. AUTHORITIES ARE SHAKEN BY THE SADISTIC NATURE OF THE CRIME. WITH NO SUSPECT OR MOTIVE, THEY ARE PLAGUED BY A SINGLE TERRORIZING THOUGHT. [ SIREN WAILS ] WHAT IF THE CRAZED KILLER VANISHED INTO THE VAST WILDERNESS OF ALASKA? >> Narrator: ALASKA STATE TROOPERS DISCOVER THE BODIES OF RICK BEERY AND HIS WIFE, DEBBIE, IN THE REMOTE ALASKAN WILDERNESS. BOTH HAVE BEEN SHOT EXECUTION-STYLE. >> PEOPLE WERE VERY FRIGHTENED. SOMEBODY WAS STILL OUT THERE WHO KILLED TWO PEOPLE IN COLD BLOOD, AND NO ONE KNEW WHERE THEY WERE. >> Narrator: PANIC GRIPS THE TINY TOWN OF CHULITNA. NEIGHBORS FEAR A PREDATOR IS LURKING AMONG THEM. BUT WHO COULD IT BE? AND WHEN MIGHT HE STRIKE AGAIN? >> IT JUST SEEMED LIKE SOMEBODY WHO WAS VERY ANGRY. THAT WAS THE FEAR -- IT WAS A NEIGHBOR WHO THEY KNEW VERY WELL, WHO STILL IN THEIR CABIN, ACTING LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED, STILL IN THE VICINITY. WAS IT A MYSTERY PERSON WHO WAS JUST A MOUNTAIN MAN WHO WAS STILL LIVING IN THE WILDERNESS AND HOMELESS OUT THERE? WAS IT A STRANGER WHO JUST CAME THROUGH AND LEFT TOWN AND IS ALREADY ON THEIR WAY? SO, THAT WAS -- THAT WAS THE FEAR. THE FEAR WAS OF THE UNKNOWN. >> Narrator: RICK BEERY HAD BEEN FOUND EXECUTED IN A CREEK. A WEEK LATER, THE BODY OF HIS WIFE, DEBBIE, WAS DISCOVERED DOWNSTREAM. SHE HAD BEEN BURIED AMONG LIMBS AND DEBRIS AND BRUTALLY VICTIMIZED. >> IT WAS TRAGIC ENOUGH, WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BROTHER, BUT I DON'T THINK HE SUFFERED. YOU KNOW? HE HAD A SHOT TO HIS HEAD AND HE -- THE LIGHTS WERE OUT. BUT I THINK DEBBIE SUFFERED. AND... IT'S AMAZINGLY NOT OKAY. THAT'S, AGAIN, LIKE PULLING THE WINGS OFF A FLY, WATCHING IT SQUIRM... TILL IT CAN'T SQUIRM ANYMORE, [Voice breaking] AND JUST LET IT DIE. >> Narrator: POLICE KNOW THE KILLER IS AS DARK AS THEY ARE DESPERATE. >> ON EVERY CASE LIKE THIS, WHERE THERE'S A MURDERER AT LARGE, LAW ENFORCEMENT, WHEREVER YOU ARE, WANTS TO FIND THIS PERSON AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IF THEY'D KILLED TWO PEOPLE, COULD EASILY KILL MORE. >> Narrator: TROOPS CONSIDER THE 21-YEAR-OLD CAMPER WHO SLEPT NEAR RICK'S CORPSE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE. BUT HE'S EASILY RULED OUT AFTER HIS DNA FAILS TO MATCH THAT FOUND ON DEBBIE'S BODY. POLICE QUESTION RICK AND DEBBIE'S NEIGHBORS AND COME UP WITH A LEAD. THE NEIGHBORS SAY THE COUPLE GOT ALONG WITH EVERYONE -- EVERYONE EXCEPT PAUL STAVENJORD, A 46-YEAR-OLD MOUNTAIN MAN WHO LIVED ABOUT A MILE AWAY. >> HE DIDN'T LIVE LIKE THE REST OF US. HE LIVED IN THE SHADOWS -- NOT IN CITY SHADOWS, BUT HE LIVED IN THE WILDERNESS. WOULD WILE AWAY HIS DAYS... OUT THERE IN THAT CABIN. >> Narrator: NEIGHBORS CLAIM STAVENJORD HAD STOLEN FUEL FROM RICK AND DEBBIE'S CABIN AND THAT RICK FURTHER SUSPECTED STAVENJORD HAD TAKEN A SNOW MACHINE AND A.22 RIFLE. >> THERE HAD BEEN SOME BAD BLOOD. THERE WAS THAT BELIEF, APPARENTLY, THAT PAUL STAVENJORD WAS TAKING THEIR PROPERTY, AND I THINK HE HAD CONFRONTED HIM OVER THAT IN THE PAST. >> Narrator: NEIGHBORS REVEAL THAT RICK ONCE SOLD STAVENJORD A CELLULAR ANTENNA. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] DURING THE TRANSACTION, STAVENJORD TOOK A CABLE THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE DEAL. >> YOU'RE WELCOME. >> Narrator: WHEN STAVENJORD LEARNED THAT RICK WANTED $50 FOR THE CABLE, HE RETURNED IT, CUT TO PIECES. >> YEAH! YEAH, AND YOU OWE ME A CABLE! >> CERTAINLY, AT THIS POINT, AND AFTER ALL THE TROOPERS AT OUR MEETING TOLD ME, PAUL STAVENJORD IS DEFINITELY A SUSPECT. STAVENJORD, IN MY OPINION, WAS THE PRIME SUSPECT. >> Narrator: DEBBIE'S BROTHER DON OFFERS FURTHER CREDENCE TO THE NEIGHBORS' CLAIMS. >> HI. I'M DEB'S BROTHER. >> Narrator: HE TELLS TROOPERS ABOUT A CHILLING ENCOUNTER WITH STAVENJORD THE NIGHT HE ARRIVED IN CHULITNA AND QUESTIONED STAVENJORD ABOUT DEBBIE'S DISAPPEARANCE. >> NO, WE DON'T TALK ANYMORE. WE HAD A FALLING OUT A LITTLE WHILE BACK. >> OKAY. THANKS. >> YOU'RE WELCOME. >> I CAN'T EXPLAIN THE FEELING, BUT IT WAS LIKE WALKING THROUGH A PIT OF RATTLESNAKES, YOU KNOW, THIS CHILL GOING UP AND DOWN MY SPINE WHEN I BACKED OUT OF THERE. [ BRUSH RUSTLING ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? >> THOUGHT I'D LOOK AROUND, TOO. >> DON'T SWEET ME. AFTER YOU. WHEN I WENT BACK TO THE CABIN, I CRAWLED ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK, INTO THE TOP OF THE CABIN, AND WAS IN A DARK SPOT. I DIDN'T SLEEP ON THE BED. I JUST CURLED UP IN THE BACK IN CASE ANYBODY WALKED IN, THAT THEY WOULDN'T SEE ME. AND I SLEPT WITH MY PISTOL RIGHT BY MY SIDE. >> Narrator: POLICE DELVE DEEPER INTO STAVENJORD'S BACKGROUND AND FIND HE HAS BEEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LAW BEFORE. AT AGE 20, STAVENJORD PULLED OFF THE BIGGEST BANK HEIST IN ALASKA HISTORY. [ SIREN WAILS ] >> HE AND, I THINK, TWO OTHER YOUNG FRIENDS OF HIS HAD ROBBED A BANK, AND THEN THEY HAD ESCAPED INTO THE MOUNTAINS. >> COME ON. >> Narrator: BUT THE TRIO HADN'T CALCULATED THE WEIGHT OF THEIR LOOT. THEY WERE FORCED TO STASH THE CASH IN THE WOODS IN ORDER TO STAY ON THE RUN. >> DONE. >> THEY WERE OUT THERE FOR A WHILE, AND IT WAS TOUGH TO TRACK THEM. >> Narrator: TWO DAYS LATER, STAVENJORD WALKED OUT OF THE BRUSH AND INTO THE ARMS OF POLICE. >> STOP! YOUR HANDS UP! ON THE CAR. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] >> Narrator: HIS CRONIES WERE ALSO CAPTURED, AND THE MONEY RECOVERED. AFTER A 3-YEAR PRISON STINT, STAVENJORD REPORTEDLY BECAME A DIFFERENT MAN. HE MARRIED, GOT A JOB WITH THE RAILROAD, AND STARTED A FAMILY. 15 YEARS LATER, THE MARRIAGE FELL APART, AND HE CAME UNHINGED. HE BEGAN DRESSING LIKE AN OLD-TIME TRAPPER AND BURIED HIMSELF IN CRAFTS, CARVING SMALL ARCTIC ANIMALS AND FLUTES OUT OF WOOD TO SELL AT LOCAL SHOPS. [ FLUTE PLAYS ] >> HE WAS AN ACCOMPLISHED FLUTIST, SO WE SAW THAT PART OF PAUL STAVENJORD, BUT WE ALSO WOULD SEE HIM OUT AT EVENTS DRESSED UP AS A MOUNTAIN MAN WITH HIS BLACK-POWDER MUSKET. AND SO WE DID SEE SOME INTERESTING -- INTERESTING PARADOX ABOUT WHO PAUL STAVENJORD WAS. >> Narrator: THE ISOLATION SEEMED TO SWALLOW HIM WHOLE. HAD PAUL STAVENJORD BECOME A WILD MAN IN A WILD PLACE? WAS IT POSSIBLE THE MILD-MANNERED MUSICIAN HAD BECOME AN ICE-COLD KILLER? >> PUT YOUR HANDS UP! ON THE CAR. >> Narrator: ALASKA STATE TROOPERS ARE ANXIOUS TO DETERMINE IF BANK ROBBER TURNED BACKWOODSMAN PAUL STAVENJORD MAY HAVE EMBRACED THE ISOLATION OF ALASKA TO THE EXTREME. IS IT POSSIBLE SUCH SECLUSION MADE HIM SNAP? >> WE WERE ALL KIND OF WONDERING, AT THE TIME, WHO COULD DO THIS. WHAT TYPE OF PERSON COULD AMBUSH A COUPLE ON THE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND? WHAT KIND OF PERSON COULD DO THIS -- BRUTALLY KILL A COUPLE AND RAPE A WOMAN AFTER SHE'S SHOT? >> Narrator: WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT THE MURDERS, STAVENJORD CLAIMS HE WASN'T ANYWHERE CLOSE TO CHULITNA AT THE TIME. >> WHERE WERE YOU, MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND? >> HE SAID HE WENT TO FAIRBANKS FOR MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND. HE STOPPED AT A GROCERY STORE. HE STOPPED TO HAVE LUNCH. >> Narrator: BUT POLICE REMEMBER THAT THE MAN WHO CAMPED NEAR RICK'S CORPSE SAID HE SAW SMOKE COMING FROM A NEARBY CABIN, MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND. STAVENJORD'S CABIN IS THE ONLY ONE IN THE AREA. TROOPERS FIND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY DISCREPANCY IN STAVENJORD'S STORY. >> SAID HE WAS IN HERE LAST WEEK AND HAD STEAK FOR LUNCH. >> WE DON'T SERVE STEAK FOR LUNCH. >> THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PLACES UP AND DOWN THE HIGHWAY WHERE HE SAID HE HAD GOTTEN GAS AND SOME SNACKS OR HAD ACTUALLY STOPPED AND HAD DINNER, PLACES HE WAS AT IN FAIRBANKS. >> DID YOU SEE HIM AT ALL? >> NO. >> COULD YOU CHECK YOUR RECEIPTS TO VERIFY THAT, PLEASE? >> SURE. >> NONE OF THESE THINGS CHECKED OUT. WE COULDN'T VERIFY ANYTHING. STAVENJORD DIDN'T HAVE RECEIPTS TO PROVE THESE PURCHASES. >> THANK YOU. >> NONE OF IT CHECKED OUT. [ DOOR OPENS ] >> Narrator: A COURT ORDER FORCES STAVENJORD TO ALLOW POLICE TO TAKE A DNA SAMPLE. THE CRIME LAB DETERMINES STAVENJORD'S DNA MATCHES THE SEMEN FOUND ON DEBBIE'S BODY. HE'S CHARGED WITH TWO COUNTS OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER AND ONE COUNT EACH OF RAPE AND THEFT. TROOPERS IMMEDIATELY ISSUE A WARRANT FOR HIS ARREST. >> WE THOUGHT WE'D GO BACK UP THERE AND WE'D TRY AND TALK TO HIM ONE MORE TIME. BUT WENT TO HIS CABIN. NOT THERE. CLEARLY, HE HAD RUN. [ FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING ] >> SEE IF YOU SEE ANYTHING ON THAT MANTEL. >> ALL RIGHT. >> Narrator: AUTHORITIES SEARCH STAVENJORD'S CABIN FOR CLUES... AND UNCOVER SOMETHING OF INTEREST. >> NEVER SEEN A CRIMINAL SUSPECT LEAVE THIS SORT OF STUFF BEHIND. >> LISTEN TO THIS. >> THEY WERE NOTES ABOUT MY CONVERSATIONS WITH STAVENJORD AND THEN, BASICALLY, HIS NARRATIVE -- A STORY, A SCRIPT, IF YOU WILL. IF YOU'RE GONNA LIE, YOU BETTER WRITE IT DOWN AND REPEAT IT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER UNTIL, JUST LIKE ANY GOOD ACTOR, YOU'VE GOT IT DOWN PRETTY GOOD AND IT BECOMES YOU. IT BECOMES HIS -- HIS STORY, HIS TRUTH. VERY DAMAGING EVIDENCE. >> Narrator: TROOPERS ALSO FIND A JOURNAL IN WHICH STAVENJORD DESCRIBES HIS LIFESTYLE. "I AM AN ARTIST AND MUSICIAN," HE WRITES. "I BUILD FLUTES, DRUMS, RATTLES, AND OTHER MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS. I DON'T HAVE A WATCH. I DON'T HAVE CREDIT CARDS. I DON'T HAVE A CHECKING ACCOUNT. ALL OF THIS IS MY CHOICE." BUT MOST UNSETTLING ARE HIS WRITINGS ABOUT RICK BEERY AND HIS WIFE. HE DESCRIBES RICK AS LIKING TO STIR THINGS UP AND SAYS DEBBIE BOWED DOWN TO HER HUSBAND. [ FLUTE PLAYS ] ACCORDING TO STAVENJORD'S WRITTEN ACCOUNT, HE WENT OUT FOR A WALK THE FRIDAY BEFORE MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND AND MET DEBBIE BY THE CREEK. HE DESCRIBES A ROMANTIC RENDEZVOUS IN WHICH HE PLAYED HIS FLUTE FOR HER. >> HE TALKED HIMSELF SO MUCH INTO THINKING THAT HE HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH DEBBIE OR THAT SHE COULD HAVE ONE WITH HIM, OR THAT HE HAD SOME KIND OF MYSTICAL POWERS OVER WOMEN AND THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF A REAL RESPONSE GOING ON THERE, THAT HE ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT WAS TRUE. AND THEN HE WROTE IT DOWN AND RECORDED IT. [ FLUTE PLAYS ] >> I THINK THAT HE WANTED A RELATIONSHIP WITH MY SISTER, AND IF HE SAID IT ENOUGH TIMES AND DID ENOUGH THINGS, IT WOULD MAKE THINGS SO. YOU COULD TELL THIS GUY IS, YOU KNOW, NOT DEALING WITH A FULL DECK WHATSOEVER. >> Narrator: HE ALSO SAYS DEBBIE CALLED HER HUSBAND AT 7:30 THAT NIGHT. >> IN HIS JOURNAL, HE SAID THAT SHE, IN FACT, CALLED HER HUSBAND AT THE CABIN AT A CERTAIN TIME, AND THERE WERE NO RECORDS THAT SHE ACTUALLY CALLED ANYBODY DURING THAT TIME. >> Narrator: DESPERATE TO BRING STAVENJORD TO JUSTICE, AUTHORITIES LAUNCH AN INTENSIVE MANHUNT. MEANWHILE, DEBBIE'S BROTHER DON HOPES TO CAPTURE THE ELUSIVE MOUNTAIN MAN HIMSELF AND CAMPS OUT AT STAVENJORD'S CABIN JUST IN CASE HE RETURNS. >> IF HE CAME BACK TO THE CABIN, WE WAS GONNA GET RIGHT DOWN TO THE TRUTH OF WHAT DID HAPPEN. IF I COULD HAVE GOT HIM IN MY SIGHT, I'D HAVE SHOT HIM IN A NEW YORK SECOND. >> Narrator: BUT STAVENJORD NEVER COMES BACK. RAILROAD WORKERS REPORT SEEING STAVENJORD WALKING ALONG THE TRACKS ON THE DAY AUTHORITIES OBTAINED HIS DNA. THEY TELL POLICE HE HAD SHAVED HIS BEARD AND MUSTACHE. A SECURITY GUARD WORKING THE SAME AREA SAYS HE SAW STAVENJORD CRASH A RED 4-WHEELER AND TAKE OFF RUNNING INTO THE WOODS THAT SAME DAY. [ ENGINE REVS ] [ CRASH ] >> WE THOUGHT HE PROBABLY HAD GONE INTO THE WOODS AND STAYED THERE. HE HAD THE SKILLS TO DO THAT, HE HAD THE BACKGROUND TO DO THAT. HE HAD A PROPENSITY TO DO THAT KIND OF THING. >> Narrator: TROOPERS LOCATE DEBBIE'S 4-WHEELER BUT FIND NO SIGN OF STAVENJORD. MEANWHILE, HIS FAMILY MAINTAINS HIS INNOCENCE AND HIRES AN ATTORNEY. A PUBLIC APPEAL IS ISSUED FOR STAVENJORD TO TURN HIMSELF IN, BUT THE PLEA GOES UNANSWERED AND THE MANHUNT CONTINUES. AS WEEKS PASS WITH NO SIGHTING OF STAVENJORD, TROOPERS ARE FORCED TO COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH THEIR WORST FEAR. >> HE'S ALREADY SNAPPED. HE'S ALREADY DONE TWO MURDERS. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND HIM, AND FIND HIM FAST. BUT NOT EASILY DONE IN WILDERNESS ALASKA. >> Narrator: AUTHORITIES SCOUR THE WOODS NEAR CHULITNA, BUT PAUL STAVENJORD HAS SEEMINGLY VANISHED -- ONE MORE AMONG THE MISSING IN ALASKA. >> IT'S LIKE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK, QUITE LITERALLY. >> FOR A GUY LIKE STAVENJORD, WHO REALLY KNEW ALASKA AND KNEW HOW TO LIVE IN REMOTE ALASKA, THERE ARE A LOT OF PLACES TO HIDE. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] >> Narrator: NEARLY FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE BRUTAL SLAYINGS OF RICK BEERY AND HIS WIFE, DEBBIE, SUSPECTED MURDERER PAUL STAVENJORD SEEMINGLY WALKED INTO THE ALASKAN BACKWOODS, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN. >> THE POSTERS WERE OUT THERE. THE CANADIAN AUTHORITIES HAD BEEN NOTIFIED. SO WE WERE HOPING HE'D BE CAUGHT IN THAT NET. BUT, NO, WE DIDN'T KNOW. WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW FAR AWAY HE WAS OR IF HE WOULD BE CAUGHT. >> Narrator: AS STATE TROOPERS CONDUCT AN INTENSE MANHUNT, PEOPLE IN THE REMOTE VILLAGE OF CHULITNA ARM THEMSELVES AGAINST THE DANGEROUS FUGITIVE. [ TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS ] >> HE CLEARLY HAD SOME SKILLS THAT WOULD PROLONG THIS WHOLE SEARCH THAT WAS GOING ON HERE. AND WHEN PEOPLE BECOME DESPERATE LIKE THAT, IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR FREEDOM, THEY MAY RESORT TO MORE VIOLENCE, THEY MAY RESORT TO MORE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. >> Narrator: SURPRISINGLY, STAVENJORD OPTS FOR A MORE PEACEFUL END. >> GIVING MYSELF UP. >> Narrator: AFTER FOUR WEEKS ON THE RUN, HE CALLS THE ATTORNEY HIS FAMILY HIRED AND SAYS HE'S READY TO TURN HIMSELF IN. >> I KNOW THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE WHO HE, HIMSELF, I THINK, SAID THAT IF HE HADN'T TURNED HIMSELF IN, WE NEVER WOULD HAVE FOUND HIM. THAT CAN HAPPEN. OCCASIONALLY, IT HAPPENS. >> Narrator: IN APRIL 1998, PAUL STAVENJORD STANDS TRIAL FOR DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND RAPE. HE ACKNOWLEDGES KILLING RICK BEERY BUT ARGUES IT WAS AN ACT OF SELF-DEFENSE. HE CLAIMS RICK CAUGHT HIM AND DEBBIE IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS. [ FLUTE PLAYS ] >> ACCORDING TO STAVENJORD, WHAT HAPPENED WAS, HE AND DEBORAH WERE AT THE CREEK. THEY WERE HAVING A SEXUAL ENCOUNTER AT THE TIME, WHEN RICK PULLED UP WITH HIS 4-WHEELER AND CAUGHT THEM IN THE ACT. >> HEY! >> NO, RICK! >> I'M GONNA BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF! >> HIS STATEMENT WAS, WHEN MR. BEERY SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, THAT HE WAS HAVING SEXUAL RELATIONS WITH HIS WIFE, MR. BEERY SAID, "I'M GOING TO BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF," PULLS OUT HIS WEAPON, AND HE STARTS SHOOTING, AT WHICH POINT IN TIME MR. STAVENJORD HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO PULL OUT HIS WEAPON AND SHOT MR. BEERY. [ GUNSHOT ] >> HE WAS SHOOTING AT ME, AND I BELIEVED THAT I WAS GOING TO BE KILLED. >> Narrator: AFTER THE CONFRONTATION, STAVENJORD SAYS HE SAW DEBBIE LYING ON THE GROUND, WITH A BULLET THROUGH HER HEAD. ACCORDING TO THE DEFENSE, RICK BEERY KILLED HIS OWN WIFE IN A MOMENT OF INEXPLICABLE RAGE. THEY FURTHER ARGUE THAT STAVENJORD PANICKED. >> HE HAD SAID THAT, AT THE TIME, HE KNEW NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE HIM -- WITH HIS CRIMINAL PAST, NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE THAT IT WAS ACCIDENTAL AND SELF-DEFENSE. >> Narrator: HE'D CARRIED DEBBIE'S BODY TO A GRASSY SPOT DOWN THE CREEK AND COVERED IT WITH BRANCHES. BY THEN, RICK'S BODY HAD FLOATED INTO A DEEP POOL, WHERE STAVENJORD LEFT IT. IN A STRANGE TWIST, ON THE LAST DAY OF TESTIMONY, STAVENJORD ASKS TO PLAY A SONG ON ONE OF HIS HAND-CARVED FLUTES. >> HE DECIDED TO PLAY HIS FLUTE, BECAUSE HIS ATTORNEY SAID HE COULD EXPRESS HIMSELF MUCH BETTER THROUGH HIS MUSIC. AND IT WAS A SONG THAT HE SAID THAT HE PLAYED FOR DEBORAH RIGHT BEFORE RICK FOUND THEM. >> HE THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA BE LIKE A SNAKE CHARMER TO THE JURY -- ONCE THEY HEARD HIS MELODIES, THAT WOULD BE IT. "HOW CAN YOU CONVICT SOMEBODY WHO CAN MAKE SUCH BEAUTIFUL MUSIC?" I GUESS. "HOW COULD DEBBIE DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN HAVE RELATIONS WITH THIS MAN AFTER HE PLAYED HIS FLUTE?" >> Narrator: BUT THE JUDGE DOESN'T ALLOW THE JURY TO HEAR STAVENJORD'S SONG. AND IN THE END, THEY DON'T BUY HIS STORY EITHER. NOR DO THE VICTIMS' RELATIVES. >> HE LIED SO MUCH, YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE OR WHAT NOT TO BELIEVE. IF HE TOLD ME THE SUN WAS SHINING, I'D GO TO THE WINDOW AND LOOK. >> DEBBIE DIDN'T LIKE MR. STAVENJORD, SO SHE WASN'T GONNA STOP AND LISTEN TO ANYTHING HE WAS GONNA DO, SAY, OR PLAY. SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY TO COPULATE WITH AN ALLIGATOR THAN THAT MAN. >> Narrator: PROSECUTORS CONTEND IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT RICK BEERY ARRIVED IN CHULITNA THAT WEEKEND TO FIND MORE OF HIS BELONGINGS MISSING, THEN CONFRONTED STAVENJORD. HOURS LATER, STAVENJORD SET OUT TO GET EVEN. KNOWING RICK WOULD HEAD TO THE PASS TO MEET DEBBIE WHEN SHE DROVE IN, STAVENJORD AMBUSHED THEM. >> HE HAD ACTUALLY LAID IN WAIT AT THE END OF THE BRIDGE, WAITING FOR THEM TO COME OVER, AND THEN TOOK THEM OUT. >> STAVENJORD SEEN RICK GOING IN TO GET DEB. STAVENJORD WAITED ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE WITH A.22 RIFLE, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, RICK, I'M SURE, SAID, "GONNA BREAK YOUR NECK IF YOU DON'T QUIT STEALING MY GAS." AND WHEN HE WAS COMING BACK IN, THAT'S WHEN HE SHOT RICK OFF HIS 4- WHEELER AND SHOT DEB. [ GUNSHOT ] >> UGH! [ GUNSHOT ] >> IF HE DIDN'T KILL RICK, RICK WOULD HAVE DIED TRYING TO GET TO HIM TO TAKE HIM OUT. DEBORAH -- YOU KNOW, SHE WOULD HAVE FOUGHT HOOK, TOOTH, AND NAIL TO SAVE RICK, TOO. >> Narrator: PAUL STAVENJORD IS CONVICTED OF TWO COUNTS OF MURDER. HE'S SENTENCED TO 198 YEARS IN PRISON. THE JUDGE NOTES, THE STEEP SENTENCE STEMS FROM THE FACT STAVENJORD NEVER EXPRESSED ANY REGRET. >> MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS, "KILL THE S.O.B.," YOU KNOW? AND TO THIS DAY, I REALLY BELIEVE "AN EYE FOR AN EYE, A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH." AND AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, HE'S BREATHING MY GOOD AIR AND TAKING UP TOO MUCH SPACE. >> THIS WAS A SENSELESS MURDER OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE TWO REALLY GOOD PEOPLE FOR WHAT APPEARS TO BE NO REASON AT ALL ANYBODY COULD TELL, OTHER THAN BAD BLOOD. NO MATTER WHAT THE WORDS WERE, THEY CERTAINLY DIDN'T JUSTIFY THE DEATH OF THESE TWO PEOPLE. [ DRILL WHIRRING ] >> Narrator: TODAY, THE MAN WHO FANCIED HIMSELF A BACKWOODSMAN COMMUNING WITH NATURE IS NOW LIVING OUT HIS LIFE IN A CONCRETE CELL. HE HAS NO CHANCE OF PAROLE. >> MR. STAVENJORD WAS LIVING THE DREAM -- THE DREAM THAT HE WANTED TO LIVE. HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. HE HAD A BEAUTIFUL CABIN. HE HAD EVERYTHING THAT HE NEEDED. AND, APPARENTLY, HE ALSO DECIDED THAT AS MUCH AS ANYTHING, THAT PERHAPS OTHER PEOPLE HAD MORE THAN HE HAD. >> HE'LL NEVER DO THIS TO NOBODY AGAIN UNLESS HE BREAKS OUT OF PRISON. IF HE DOES, I HOPE HE COMES AND VISITS ME.
