 [ HOWLING ] Narrator: IN THE ICY EXTREMES OF COLORADO, EVIL TAKES MANY FORMS. IT'S ABJECT TERROR. [ TIRES SCREECH ] HE'S GONNA KILL ME! PLEASE HELP! PLEASE!

 SHE'S NOT GONNA DO WELL OUT IN THE WILDERNESS. Narrator: A HORRIFIC ASSAULT THAT'S ALMOST UNIMAGINABLE EXCEPT THAT IT'S SO FAMILIAR. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO'S DONE THIS BEFORE. IT REALLY STARTED FEELING LIKE MORE OF A SERIAL KILLER. Narrator: THE KEY TO THESE CRIMES -- A CLUE HIDDEN IN THE ICE. WE WERE JUST HUNGRY TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GONNA BE THE NEXT BIZARRE TWIST IN THIS WEIRD STORY. IT'S LIKE HAVING A 1,000-PIECE JIGSAW PUZZLE AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN ON THE TABLE. THEY'RE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE ROOM AND YOU GOT TO GO FIND THEM AND BRING THEM UP TO THE TABLE. [ WOMAN SCREAMS ]

 CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: FEBRUARY 1994. THICK, WET SNOW BLANKETS COLORADO'S ROCKY MOUNTAINS. IT SMOTHERS THE JAGGED PEAKS AND CREEPS DOWN TO BURY DENVER AND ITS SUBURBS BELOW. NORTH OF DENVER IS THORNTON, A MOUNTAIN TOWN SURROUNDED BY SKI SLOPES. AT 5:45 IN THE MORNING, 30-YEAR-OLD JACKIE CREAZZO CAREFULLY NAVIGATES A SLICK INTERSTATE OFF-RAMP, PLANNING HER ESCAPE FROM THORNTON'S BLISTERING COLD. Moriarty: SHE GETS UP THAT MORNING AND IS ON HER WAY TO GET HER FATHER TO GO TO THE AIRPORT TO GO SPEND TIME IN LAS VEGAS. Narrator: ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, SHE SEES WHAT SHE THINKS IS A STRANDED DRIVER. Grant: SHE SAW A SMALL BLONDE FIGURE THAT APPEARED TO BE IN DISTRESS, ARMS WAVING, AND SHE THOUGHT THAT THE PERSON WAS IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE. [ Crying ] PLEASE LET ME IN! HE'S GONNA KILL ME! PLEASE! PLEASE, GO! GO! OKAY, OKAY, OKAY. SHE THINKS TO HERSELF, "I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING HERE "BECAUSE THIS HYSTERICAL WOMAN "THINKS THIS MAN IS GONNA KILL HER, WHICH MEANS I'M IN DANGER, AS WELL." IT'S GONNA BE FINE. IT'S GONNA BE FINE. WHAT TIME IS IT? 5:58. HE JUST RAPED ME FOR OVER TWO HOURS. OH, MY GOD. I'M GONNA GET YOU SOMEPLACE SAFE, I PROMISE. HER TERROR LEVEL IS OUT OF SIGHT. SHE'S BEEN HORRIBLY ABUSED. SHE'S BEEN ABDUCTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. SHE'S BEEN BRUTALIZED FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS. SHE'S HYSTERICAL, COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL. Narrator: JACKIE HEADS FOR THE THORNTON POLICE DEPARTMENT, ONLY THREE MILES AWAY. BUT TROUBLE'S CLOSING FAST. [ PANTING ] PLEASE, GO! HE'S RIGHT THERE! HE'S GONNA KILL ME! McKinley: THEY WERE DRIVING FOR THEIR LIVES. JACKIE HAD NO IDEA WHO THIS GUY WAS THAT WAS FOLLOWING THEM, AND HE HAD NO FEAR. Grant: JACKIE GOES FROM "I WANT TO HELP SOMEBODY" TO "OH, MY GOD" IN [SNAPS] THAT QUICK. Narrator: JACKIE'S SPEEDING TIRES SPIN HELPLESSLY ON THE BLACK ICE. PLEASE, GOD! THE SEDAN KEEPS GAINING. THEY'RE ALMOST AT THE POLICE STATION. [ SCREAMS ] OUT OF NOWHERE, GUNSHOTS. [ GUNSHOT ] AAH! TOTALLY LIKE A HOLLYWOOD MOVIE. [ TIRES SCREECH ] THE SHOTS JUST KEEP COMING. [ GUNSHOTS, GLASS SHATTERS ] Grant: JACKIE IS HIT. SHE LOSES CONTROL OF HER LOWER EXTREMITIES AND SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH THE CAR. THE MOST SHE CAN DO IS JUST GRAB THE WHEEL, AND SHE'S HOLDING IT REALLY TIGHT, AND SHE'S TRYING TO STEER IT, TRYING TO GUIDE THE CAR. [ SCREAMING ] Narrator: JACKIE PLOWS ACROSS THE MEDIAN AND INTO A SNOW BANK 100 YARDS FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. Grant: TALK ABOUT REALITY TELEVISION. THIS WAS REALITY. THIS WAS REALITY. Narrator: THEY'VE MADE IT TO THE STATION BUT NOT TO SAFETY. THE SNOW MUFFLES THE SOUND OF THE CRASH. THE COPS HEAR NOTHING. THE SHOOTER CLOSES IN. THERE'S NOWHERE TO RUN. [ WHIMPERING ] Narrator: THE GUNMAN RETURNS TO FINISH OFF JACKIE. JACKIE IS SURE THAT SHE'S GONNA DIE, THAT THIS IS THE LAST FACE SHE'LL EVER SEE. HOW'S IT FEEL TO DIE? [ GUN CLICKS ] Narrator: HE'S OUT OF BULLETS. Grant: SHE SAID SHE'D NEVER FORGET THAT STONE-COLD STARE. WHAT A THING TO HAVE HAPPENED IN BARELY 10 MINUTES, FROM STOPPING TO ASSIST A FELLOW TRAVELLER TO THINKING YOU'RE GONNA DIE. CAN'T FATHOM IT. CAN'T FATHOM IT. Narrator: THE GUNMAN HAS RECLAIMED HIS VICTIM. HELP ARRIVES MOMENTS LATER. WHAT HAPPENED? [ SIREN WAILING ] AN OFFICER TAKES JACKIE'S BARELY COHERENT STORY. Moriarty: THE INFORMATION THAT WE WERE GETTING FROM JACKIE ON SCENE, TALKING ABOUT A RAPE AND EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED AND SHOTS BEING FIRED, WE STILL DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO THE VICTIM IS. IT'S NOT MAKING ANY SENSE. Narrator: WHY WOULD THE KIDNAPPER RELEASE HIS VICTIM ONLY TO CHASE HER DOWN AGAIN? Carbone: SOMETHING THAT, IN HIS MIND, MADE HIM FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT HE WAS GONNA LET HER GO AND THEN HE WASN'T GONNA GET INTO TROUBLE. AND THEN SOMETHING CLICKED ONCE SHE GOT PICKED UP THAT HE MADE A MISTAKE AND HE NEEDED TO REMEDY THAT MISTAKE. Narrator: THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE, THE CHASE AND RECAPTURE -- IT SOUNDS LIKE A PERSONAL VENDETTA. IT SEEMS LIKE A BAD DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. IT WAS A BAD EVENING OUT AND FRIENDS WERE TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE HUSBAND OR THE BOYFRIEND. I MEAN, IT JUST FELT LIKE THAT KIND OF A SCENARIO. WHY ELSE WOULD SOMEBODY IN ONE CAR TAKE SOMEBODY OUT OF ANOTHER CAR UNLESS THEY KNEW THEM? [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] Narrator: THE KIDNAPPING VICTIM HADN'T EVEN TOLD JACKIE HER NAME. WE HAVE THIS CRIME SCENE. WE HAVE A VICTIM THAT'S KIDNAPPED. WE NOW HAVE OFFICERS AND DOGS TRYING TO TRACK THE CAR. I MEAN, THERE IS SO MUCH HAPPENING FOR SUCH A LITTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT ALL AT ONCE. [ SIRENS WAILING ] Narrator: BEFORE THE SOLE WITNESS CAN GIVE MORE DETAILS, SHE'S RUSHED INTO SURGERY. THE FATE OF THE CASE HINGES ON WHETHER JACKIE LIVES OR DIES. WE HAD JACKIE AT THE HOSPITAL UNDERGOING MASSIVE SURGERIES, BEING TUBED IN THE SIDE, COMING IN AND OUT OF CONSCIOUSNESS, GOING INTO CARDIAC ARREST. WE THINK SHE'S GONNA DIE. [ MONITOR BEEPING ] NOW'S NOT A GOOD TIME TO INTERVIEW HER, BUT THERE WAS THAT SENSE OF URGENCY LIKE, "WELL, IF I DON'T DO IT NOW, WE MIGHT NOT EVER GET HER LAST WORDS." YOU'RE TRYING TO SAVE A LIFE OF JACKIE CREAZZO WHILE AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO GATHER AS MUCH INFORMATION TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THE PERSON THAT'S KIDNAPPED. [ MONITOR BEEPING ] [ FLATLINE ] [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] Narrator: AS AN ICY WINTER GRIPS COLORADO, GOOD SAMARITAN JACKIE CREAZZO HOLDS THE KEY TO IDENTIFYING A KIDNAPPING VICTIM AND HER ASSAILANT. I SAW THE ACCIDENT. RUSHED TO EMERGENCY SURGERY, SHE MANAGES TO TELL INVESTIGATORS WHERE SHE PICKED UP THE YOUNG WOMAN. SO, WE SEND OFFICERS DOWN THERE. Grant: THERE WASN'T ANYTHING MECHANICALLY WRONG WITH IT. THE THEORY IS THAT SHE SOMEHOW WAS FORCED TO STOP. Moriarty: WE RUN THE LICENSE PLATE OF THAT CAR TO FIGURE OUT WHO POTENTIALLY THE VICTIM COULD BE THAT THE SUSPECT HAS TAKEN AWAY. Narrator: THE CAR IS REGISTERED TO A MAN NAMED CASEY BRADSHAW. QUESTIONED AT HIS HOME, BRADSHAW TELLS POLICE HIS 25-YEAR-OLD WIFE, RHONDA, DRIVES THE CAR AND SHE STILL HASN'T COME HOME FROM WORK. THE VEHICLE HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT. YOU DON'T REMEMBER HER COMING BACK AT ALL? SHE HASN'T BEEN HOME. I'VE BEEN WORRIED SICK. YOUR FIRST CONTACT WITH SOMEONE IS VERY TELLING AND YOU WANT TO GET THEIR RESPONSE. WHAT DOES HE THINK ABOUT THAT IT'S 8:00 IN THE MORNING BY THE TIME WE'RE MAKING NOTIFICATION AND HIS WIFE'S NOT HOME YET? IS HE ANGRY? DOES HE HAVE AN IDEA WHERE SHE IS? Narrator: HE CLAIMS HE LAST SAW RHONDA WHEN SHE LEFT FOR HER JOB AS A COCKTAIL WAITRESS AT A MOUNTAINSIDE CASINO. IT'S A TEMPORARY GIG. RHONDA DREAMS OF BEING A COP. Moriarty: SHE WAS EARNING MORE MONEY IN THE EVENING TO START HER LIFE, YOU KNOW? A VERY TYPICAL, DRIVEN YOUNG FEMALE, WILLING TO WORK THE LATE HOURS. SHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE MONEY TO BUY A HOME. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] Narrator: BUT MONEY PROBLEMS CAN BE A TRIGGER FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THOUGH CASEY BRADSHAW SEEMS CONCERNED, HE'S NOT OFF THE HOOK. Moriarty: HOW'S THEIR RELATIONSHIP BEEN GOING SINCE THEY'VE BEEN MARRIED? ARE THEY IN DEBT? DO THEY OWE MONEY TO ANYBODY? DO THEY DO DRUGS? ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE JUST TYPICAL CHECKLIST KIND OF THINGS. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS ALSO CHECK WITH THE CASINO, WHICH ATTRACTS ALL SORTS OF CHARACTERS. Moriarty: WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT FIRST 24 HOURS AND YOU HAVE A VICTIM WHO'S BEEN KIDNAPPED AND YOU JUST NOW IDENTIFIED WHO SHE IS, YOU WANT TO THINK OF ANY CONNECTION IN HER LIFE THAT COULD POSSIBLY GET YOU TO SOMEBODY WHO'S ASSOCIATED WITH HER THAT COULD HELP SOLVE THE MYSTERY. Narrator: NONE OF HER COWORKERS RECALL ANY PARTICULARLY CREEPY CUSTOMERS THAT NIGHT. WHEN HER SHIFT ENDED AT 2:00 A.M., THE HARDWORKING WIFE AND STEPMOTHER TOOK A CASINO BUS TO HER CAR IN THE PARK-AND-RIDE LOT. Grant: WE DON'T HAVE ANY DIRECT EVIDENCE OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED ONCE SHE GOT OFF THAT CASINO BUS. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS HOPE JACKIE CREAZZO CAN FILL IN THE BLANKS. SHE BARELY SURVIVED HER ORDEAL. THREE BULLETS TORE INTO HER... [ ENGINE REVS, SCREAMING ] [ GUNSHOT ] ...IN THE FACE... [ GUNSHOT ] ...IN THE SHOULDER... [ GUNSHOT ] ...AND ONE PIERCED HER SPINE. Man: SIR, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY. IT'S CRITICAL. UNFORTUNATELY SHE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO WALK AGAIN. I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN. EVERYTHING ABOUT HER LIFE AS SHE KNEW IT WAS NO LONGER THE SAME. Narrator: ALL BECAUSE SHE STOPPED TO HELP A STRANGER. McKinley: WE ALL HOPED THAT WE COULD BE THAT PERSON. YOU THINK, "COULD I HAVE DONE THE SAME THING JACKIE CREAZZO DID?" WE ALL HOPED THAT WE COULD HAVE. BUT REALLY, IF WE LOOK INSIDE OURSELVES, MOST OF US PROBABLY COULDN'T HAVE OR WOULDN'T HAVE. Narrator: JACKIE'S ABLE TO RECOGNIZE A PHOTO OF RHONDA. [ GUNSHOT ] SHE TELLS POLICE WHAT RHONDA TOLD HER. Moriarty: A SEDAN BUMPS HER CAR AND CAUSES AN ACCIDENT. SHE PULLS OVER. IT'S NOT A BIG ACCIDENT, BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION. THE DRIVER OF THE SEDAN CONVINCES RHONDA TO GET IN HIS CAR BECAUSE IT'S SNOWY AND THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE SO POOR. FROM THE TIME THE ACCIDENT OCCURS AND THAT SHE GETS IN THE CAR IS WHEN THE SEXUAL ASSAULT STARTS TAKING PLACE. Narrator: HE DROVE HER TO ANOTHER SPOT AND RAPED HER FOR TWO HOURS. INEXPLICABLY, HE DROPPED HER BACK OFF AT HER CAR. Carbone: YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR HEAD, WHETHER HE HAD DONE THIS BEFORE AND LET A VICTIM GO AND THEN THE VICTIM NEVER TESTIFIED. Moriarty: SHE LITERALLY FEARED FOR HER LIFE THAT HE WAS GONNA KILL HER. AND WHEN JACKIE CREAZZO'S CAR GOES BY, SHE'S SEES IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO START RUNNING IN HOPES THAT THIS CAR WILL STOP. Narrator: THEN THE CHASE, THE SHOOTING... [ GUNSHOT ] ...THE RECAPTURE. IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A FIRST-TIME CRIMINAL'S WORK. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO'S DONE THIS BEFORE. IT REALLY STARTED FEELING LIKE MORE OF A SERIAL KILLER. Narrator: CRIME-SCENE ANALYSTS COMB THE SNOWY OFF-RAMP FOR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT LEAD THEM TO THE KIDNAPPER. A DENT IN THE CAR AND FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW SUPPORT JACKIE'S ACCOUNT. TO LOCAL COPS, THE TALE OF TERROR THAT STARTS WITH A STAGED FENDER BENDER SOUNDS FAMILIAR. THE MORE DESCRIPTIVE THEY GOT FROM WITNESSES WHO HAD SEEN THESE EVENTS, YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDED LIKE JESSICA ARREDONDO. Narrator: ON A COLD NOVEMBER MORNING IN 1988, 21-YEAR-OLD JESSICA ARREDONDO FAILED TO SHOW UP FOR WORK. THEY CALLED UP FROM WORK AND THEY ASKED IF SHE WAS HOME. WE THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD ALREADY LEFT, AND SO WE CHECKED HER BEDROOM AND SAW THAT HER BED HADN'T BEEN SLEPT ON. Narrator: SHE'D BEEN WITH HER BOYFRIEND THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT HE CLAIMED HE HADN'T SEEN HER SINCE SHE DROPPED HIM OFF AT A NIGHTCLUB. [ CAR DOOR CLOSES ] Toppenberg: SHE WAS GONNA DRIVE AROUND A WHILE AND THEN COME BACK AND PICK HIM UP. SHE NEVER CAME BACK TO PICK HIM UP. Narrator: THE NIGHT JESSICA DISAPPEARED... [ CRASH ] ...A WOMAN REPORTED HEARING A COMMOTION IN THE STREET. SHE WAS LAYING IN BED AWAKE. SHE HEARD A MINOR CAR ACCIDENT. SHE HEARD MULTIPLE MEN YELLING AT EACH OTHER AND THEN GET IN A CAR AND THE CAR DROVE OFF WITH A LOUD, FAST SORT OF A GETAWAY. AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT THAT'S WHERE JESSICA ARREDONDO HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED FROM. Narrator: THE WITNESS GOT A BRIEF LOOK AT THE MEN. SHE SAW A LIGHT-SKINNED BLACK MALE AND A WHITE MALE. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, A COUPLE OF KIDS FOUND DISCARDED CLOTHES AND A NAKED BODY. JESSICA ARREDONDO WAS TAKEN FROM HER CAR, AND HER BODY WAS FOUND IN ESTES PARK, COLORADO -- A LONG WAYS AWAY FROM WHERE SHE WAS TAKEN IN DENVER. Narrator: AS POLICE RECOVERED THE VICTIM, THEY NOTED FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW. Haze: WHAT WE FOUND OUT WAS THAT THERE APPEARED TO BE TWO SETS OF TRACKS. THERE WERE TWO MEN INVOLVED. AND THEY APPARENTLY CARRIED HER NUDE BODY OUT OF THIS VEHICLE AND THEY CARRIED HER UP AN EMBANKMENT AND THREW HER OVER. Narrator: HER CAUSE OF DEATH WAS TRAUMA CONSISTENT WITH JUMPING OUT OF A MOVING VEHICLE -- JUST LIKE RHONDA BRADSHAW, JESSICA DID ALL SHE COULD TO ESCAPE HER ATTACKERS. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY ANYBODY WOULD WANT TO HURT HER. I JUST WONDERED, "WELL, HOW COULD ANYBODY DO ANYTHING LIKE THIS TO SUCH A WONDERFUL PERSON AS JESSICA?" Narrator: TWO DAYS LATER, POLICE FOUND JESSICA'S NEW MUSTANG ABANDONED, JUST LIKE IN RHONDA'S CASE. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] THE DOORS WERE LOCKED AND THE BODY DENTED, LIKE SHE'D BEEN FORCED OFF THE ROAD LIKE RHONDA BRADSHAW. HER KILLERS WERE NEVER CAUGHT. Grant: WE FELT LIKE THERE WERE A LOT OF SIMILARITIES -- THE CAR CHASE, THE ABDUCTION FROM THE CAR. THAT PIQUED OUR INTEREST. Narrator: QUESTION IS, ARE THE TWO CASES CONNECTED? Toppenberg: JESSICA ARREDONDO AND RHONDA WERE SIMILAR IN APPEARANCE, IN AGE, IN GENERAL LOCATION. SERIAL KILLERS USUALLY HAVE A FRAMEWORK THAT THEY WORK WITHIN. AND THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN JESSICA AND RHONDA CERTAINLY FIT THAT PROFILE. IT WAS PART OF THE CONNECTION THERE. HE FOUND HIS VICTIM, PREYED ON IT, THAT WAS PART OF THE PROCESS, PART OF THE GAME WAS THE HUNT. POTENTIALLY EVEN KNOW THE PERSON BEFOREHAND, MAYBE NOT. Narrator: IF IT IS THE SAME ATTACKER, HE NOW HAS RHONDA BRADSHAW. AND IF HE HASN'T KILLED HER, THE COLORADO COLD JUST MIGHT. Schmidt: A WOMAN WOULD NOT LIKELY BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ANY NIGHTS ALONE OUT IN THE COLORADO ROCKIES WITHOUT ADEQUATE SHELTER, CLOTHING, OR ANY KIND OF PREPAREDNESS. Narrator: AND NOW, AS A WICKED WINTER STORM BEARS DOWN ON COLORADO, RHONDA'S CHANCES OF SURVIVAL GROW EVEN SLIMMER. [ HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] Narrator: AFTER A BRAZEN ABDUCTION, COLORADO POLICE SEARCH FOR 25-YEAR-OLD RHONDA BRADSHAW. THERE'S AN URGENCY BECAUSE A YOUNG WOMAN WAS KIDNAPPED AND YOU WANT TO GET HER BACK BEFORE SOMETHING ELSE BAD HAPPENS TO HER. Narrator: A WINTER STORM SLOWS THEM DOWN. TIME IS RUNNING OUT. THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE THAT SOMEONE WILL BE FOUND ALIVE WHEN THEY'RE MISSING. EVERYBODY HOPED THAT SHE WOULD BE FOUND ALIVE. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS QUESTION RHONDA'S HUSBAND AGAIN, BUT HE HAS NO IDEA WHO MIGHT HAVE GRABBED HER. Moriarty: HE WAS DISTRAUGHT. HE WAS GOING THROUGH SOME SERIOUS DENIAL THAT, LIKE, IT CAN'T BE HER. THE MORE WE TALKED TO HIM, THE MORE YOU COULD JUST FEEL THAT HE WAS VERY GENUINE ABOUT THAT. NOTHING LED US TO BELIEVE THIS WAS ANY KIND OF A LOVE TRIANGLE. [ CRYING ] Narrator: HE'S OFF THE SUSPECT LIST, LEFT ONLY TO HOPE POLICE CAN FIND RHONDA ALIVE. DETECTIVES HAVE LITTLE TO GO ON. JACKIE CREAZZO, THE LONE WITNESS, PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF RHONDA'S ABDUCTOR. Moriarty: IT WAS A PRETTY GENERIC DESCRIPTION -- BLACK MALE, CLEAN-CUT, 25 TO 30 YEARS OF AGE. Narrator: HE COULD BE A COWORKER, A CUSTOMER FROM THE CASINO, OR A COMPLETE STRANGER. DESPERATE, AUTHORITIES RETRACE THEIR OWN STEPS. WE HAD ONE DETECTIVE THAT DIDN'T COME TO THE CALL. HE HAD BEEN BUSY AND DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT AWAY. AND HE'S LIKE, "OH, I'D LIKE TO SEE THE CRIME SCENE." AND SO, WE'RE LIKE, "YOU'RE KIDDING." LIKE, "WHERE WERE YOU 12 HOURS AGO?" Narrator: TURNS OUT, REVISITING THE CRIME SCENE IS A STROKE OF GOOD LUCK. NOW IT'S A NEW FEELING AT THE CRIME SCENE. YOU HAVE SOME MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE TALKED WITH JACKIE ABOUT, HOW SHE'S RELAYED RHONDA'S STORY. SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE CRIME SCENE DIFFERENT THAN YOU WERE EARLIER IN THE MORNING. Narrator: BY NOW, THE MELTING SNOW REVEALS A NEW CLUE. WE'RE JUST KIND OF LOOKING AROUND AND YOU HEAR... [ IMITATES BUZZING ] AND WE'RE LIKE, "WHAT'S THAT?" AND ONE OF THE ADAMS COUNTY S.O. -- SHERIFF'S OFFICERS... [ PAGER VIBRATING ] ...FINDS A PAGER. WE'RE LIKE, "WOW. "IF WE HADN'T COME DOWN HERE "TO SHOW THIS LATECOMER DETECTIVE THE CRIME SCENE, "WOULD HAVE WE ALL BEEN AROUND HER CAR AND BEEN ABLE TO HEAR A PAGER BEFORE THE BATTERY DIED?" Narrator: THERE, ON THE FROZEN GROUND, THE CASE SUDDENLY ISN'T SO COLD. Moriarty: WHEN YOU FIND NEW EVIDENCE, TRULY YOU THINK TO YOURSELF "SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO BE LUCKY THAN GOOD." AND IT FELT LUCKY. IT FELT LIKE A HUGE DOOR OPENED FOR US IN THIS CASE. Narrator: DETECTIVES CALL THE LAST NUMBER ON THE PAGER [ Ringing ] AND HEAR A SHOCKING MESSAGE. MAN: If you find this pager, return it to the Denver police department. This pager is the property of the Denver police department. There is a reward for returning this pager. THE PAGER BELONGS TO DENVER POLICE DETECTIVE MATTHEW KINCAID. Moriarty: I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU. AS THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR, THE LEAD DETECTIVE ON THIS, I AM IMMEDIATELY THINKING, "WHAT WAS A DENVER DETECTIVE DOING AT OUR CRIME SCENE?" YOU START GOING, "IS A POLICE OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME?" Narrator: IT'S UNIMAGINABLE. Moriarty: OH, THERE'S A BROTHERHOOD. BUT WHEN YOU CROSS A LINE LIKE THAT, THAT'S A SERIOUS LINE. THERE'S NO PROTECTING. IT'S LIKE, "IF IT IS THIS DENVER DETECTIVE, WE'RE TAKING HIM DOWN." Narrator: A BACKGROUND CHECK MAKES THEM WORRY. THOUGH KINCAID'S A 20-YEAR VETERAN OF THE FORCE, HIS PERSONAL LIFE TROUBLES INVESTIGATORS. SO, WHEN WE STARTED DOING BACKGROUND CHECKS AND FIGURING OUT WHAT KIND OF CRIMINAL HISTORY THAT HE COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE, THEN WE WERE LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH. HE SHOT HIS WIFE IN THE STOMACH." [ GUNSHOT, WOMAN SCREAMS ] Narrator: REMARKABLY, SHE DIDN'T PRESS CHARGES. Moriarty: WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SHOOTING AND IT'S LIKE, "THE SHOOTING WAS CONSIDERED ACCIDENTAL? HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN?" Narrator: KINCAID DOESN'T FIT JACKIE CREAZZO'S DESCRIPTION OF THE RAPIST AS A CLEAN-CUT 30-YEAR-OLD. COULD HE BE PROTECTING SOMEONE? HE WAS AN OLDER GENTLEMAN, DIDN'T FIT THE PROFILE. AND SO, RIGHT AWAY THERE WAS AN ASSUMPTION THAT IT WAS MAYBE A RELATIVE OR SOMEBODY CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH HIM. Narrator: POLICE LEARN KINCAID'S NEPHEW DANIEL SHOT A MAN WHEN HE WAS 16. [ GUNSHOTS ] HE SERVED JUST FIVE YEARS AND IS NOW FREE. WE'RE LIKE, "OKAY, THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE BIT MORE SERIOUS." Narrator: DETECTIVE KINCAID ALSO HAS TWO SONS. ONE OF THEM, ROBERT HARLAN, HAS A RECORD FOR ASSAULT. HE, TOO, IS FREE AND LIVING IN THE AREA. Moriarty: IT'S LIKE HAVING A 1,000-PIECE JIGSAW PUZZLE AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN ON THE TABLE. THEY'RE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE ROOM AND YOU GOT TO GO FIND THEM AND BRING THEM UP TO THE TABLE. Narrator: DETECTIVES HAVE TO SOLVE IT FAST. RHONDA MIGHT STILL BE AT THIS MAN'S MERCY. IF YOU'RE THE SUSPECT AND YOUR VICTIM HAS ESCAPED ONCE, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN. THE SECOND ESCAPE SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE. [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] Narrator: POLICE IN COLORADO RACE AGAINST TIME TO CATCH A VIOLENT SEXUAL PREDATOR. THEY HAVE A CHILLING SUSPICION RHONDA BRADSHAW ISN'T HIS FIRST VICTIM. Carbone: BY THE WAY HE DID THIS, IT PROBABLY WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT HE DID IT. HE PROBABLY WATCHED HER, STUDIED HER, AND THIS PARTICULAR WOMAN FIT HIS PROFILE. Narrator: POLICE SUSPECT HE ALSO MURDERED JESSICA ARREDONDO SIX YEARS EARLIER. McKinley: THE SIMILARITIES ARE THAT JESSICA ARREDONDO AND RHONDA WERE BOTH IN THEIR CARS AND WERE SOMEHOW FOLLOWED AND THEN RUN OFF THE ROAD. Narrator: A DENVER POLICE DETECTIVE'S PAGER FOUND NEAR RHONDA'S CAR PROVIDES AN UNSETTLING CLUE. THE DETECTIVE'S NEPHEW DANIEL DID TIME FOR A FATAL SHOOTING. AND HIS SON ROBERT HARLAN HAS A RECORD FOR ASSAULT. WHEN THE NEWS REPORTS A DESCRIPTION OF THE ABDUCTOR'S CAR, THE CALLS START COMING IN, IMPLICATING THE SON. Moriarty: ON THE TIP LINE, WE WERE GETTING CALLS. THE PEOPLE WERE SAYING, "WE BELIVE THIS IS ROBERT HARLAN. HIS CAR MATCHES." SO, NOW WE'RE GETTING CALLS ON THE TIP LINE THAT ARE MATCHING THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE FROM THE PAGER. AND HE FITS THE AGE DESCRIPTION. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT HARLAN. HE WAS A VERY SOCIAL PERSON, LIKED TO GO TO THE BARS, VERY ACTIVE WITH WOMEN. HE WAS KIND OF A LADIES' MAN. HEY. [ CHUCKLES ] Narrator: IN APRIL 1991, A YOUNG WOMAN REPORTED THAT WHILE SHE WAS ON A DATE WITH HARLAN AT HIS HOUSE, HE RAPED HER. HE THREATENED TO KILL HER IF SHE EVER TOLD ANYONE. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] SIT DOWN! EMBARRASSMENT. McKinley: HIS OWN DAD ARRESTED HIM FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT. SO, HIS DAD WAS TRYING TO FACE UP TO THIS DEMON CHILD. Narrator: AFTER A MISTRIAL, THE WOMAN REFUSED TO TESTIFY AGAINST ROBERT HARLAN A SECOND TIME. HE AVOIDED JAIL WHEN A JUDGE GAVE HIM TWO YEARS' PROBATION AND ORDERED HIM TO COMPLETE A SEX OFFENDER PROGRAM. THIS IS TEXTBOOK CASE OF A GUY WHO JUST WAS GIVEN EVERY CHANCE IN THE WORLD. HE THOUGHT THAT HE'D BE LET OFF SO MANY TIMES THAT HE WASN'T GONNA HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS ONE. Narrator: THORNTON OFFICERS DISCOVER THAT HARLAN AND MURDER VICTIM JESSICA ARREDONDO WORKED AT THE SAME COMPANY WHEN JESSICA DISAPPEARED. Toppenberg: IT WAS A GIGANTIC RED FLAG, ESPECIALLY WITH ROBERT HARLAN WORKING SECURITY THERE. AND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A WITNESS THAT GAVE US A COMPOSITE SKETCH OF SOMEONE THAT WAS DRIVING IN PURSUIT OF JESSICA ARREDONDO THE EVENING SHE DISAPPEARED. AND THAT PERSON LOOKED LIKE ROBERT HARLAN. Narrator: DETECTIVES DEMAND THE COMPANY TURN OVER HIS PERSONNEL FILES. Moriarty: I AM EXPECTING TO GET SOME MANILA ENVELOPES. AND THEY BRING OUT BOXES OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST ROBERT HARLAN. AND I REMEMBER JUST BEING SHOCKED AND THINKING, "THIS IS REMARKABLE." HOW MANY COMPLAINTS DID THEY HAVE ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON THIS GUY THAT DIDN'T MAKE IT TO A POLICE DEPARTMENT? AUTHORITIES VISIT JACKIE CREAZZO IN THE HOSPITAL. SHE'S THE ONE PERSON WHO MIGHT POSITIVELY I.D. THEIR NEW PRIME SUSPECT. Woman: FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO SAY... THIS MOMENT IS THE REASON SHE FOUGHT SO HARD TO STAY ALIVE. TAKE YOUR TIME LOOKING AT THEM. Moriarty: WHEN I'M INTERVIEWING JACKIE, SHE SAYS TO ME, SHE GOES, "I DIDN'T HAVE TO COME BACK." AND I JUST KIND OF LOOK AT HER, AND SHE GOES, "WHEN I WAS IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM, "THERE WAS A WHITE LIGHT. "AND I HEARD A VOICE SAYING, 'YOU CAN COME TO THE WHITE LIGHT OR YOU CAN GO BACK.'" AND SHE SAID, "AND I KNEW RIGHT THEN AND THERE "THAT I KNEW WHO THIS PERSON WAS, "AND I HAD TO COME BACK BECAUSE I COULD TELL WHO THIS PERSON WAS." Creazzo: THAT'S THE GUY. I KNOW THIS IS HIM. THIS IS HIM. Moriarty: THERE WAS NOT A QUESTION IN HER MIND. SHE'S LIKE, "ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE THAT'S YOUR GUY." Narrator: THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. THE BAD NEWS COMES RIGHT ON ITS TAIL. ROAD WORKERS IN NEARBY AURORA FIND BLOODY CLOTHES BENEATH AN OVERPASS. THEY MATCH WHAT RHONDA WORE THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED. [ SIREN WAILING ] BLOODHOUNDS SCOUR THE FROZEN CULVERTS AND OFF-RAMPS. ONE SUDDENLY SOUNDS AN ALERT. Carbone: WE FOUND A BULLET AND WE FOUND HER BLOOD. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THE WOUND WAS AT THAT TIME, SO THAT WAS CERTAINLY A CONCERN TO US. Narrator: WITHOUT A BODY, THERE'S NO PROOF RHONDA IS DEAD. WITH RENEWED URGENCY, POLICE CLOSE IN ON ROBERT HARLAN'S HOME BRACED FOR BATTLE AND, THEY HOPE, A RESCUE. ROBERT HARLAN! THIS IS THE POLICE! WE HAVE A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST! OPEN THE DOOR! ROBERT HARLAN, WE HAVE A WARRANT FOR YOUR ARREST! OPEN THE DOOR! THIS IS THE POLICE! [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] Narrator: POLICE IN COLORADO CLOSE IN ON ROBERT HARLAN, SUSPECTED OF SNATCHING RHONDA BRADSHAW AND MURDERING JESSICA ARREDONDO. IT'S EARLY IN THE MORNING, AND WE DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW HE'S GONNA RESPOND. SO WE'RE READY WITH THE ENTRY TEAM. [ GLASS BREAKING ] Carbone: BEFORE THEY WENT IN, THEY DID THE FLASH GRENADES. THEY KNEW HE WAS ARMED AND THEY TOOK ALL THE PRECAUTIONS. Narrator: IN THE END, HE SURPRISES EVERYONE BY SURRENDERING QUIETLY. Toppenberg: ROBERT HARLAN WAS THE SON OF A DETECTIVE WITH THE DENVER POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND AS SUCH, HE PROBABLY KNEW MORE ABOUT EVIDENCE, EVIDENCE COLLECTION, AND HOW TO HIDE EVIDENCE THAN MOST PEOPLE. HE WAS A MORE DAUNTING SUSPECT THAN MOST. Narrator: EVEN SO, EVIDENCE TECHS COLLECT A CACHE OF AMMUNITION, SEX AIDS, PORN MAGAZINES, AND A CRACK PIPE. WHAT THEY DON'T FIND IS RHONDA. Moriarty: THERE WAS BLOOD EVIDENCE IN THE CAR. HE HAD TRIED TO CLEAN IT. THERE WAS SOME ON THE DOOR FRAME WHERE JACKIE HAD DESCRIBED THAT HE DRUG HER BACK AND PUT HER INTO THE BACKSEAT OF THE CAR. Narrator: POLICE STILL HAVE NO BODY, NO PROOF THAT RHONDA IS DEAD. WITH ALL THE BLOOD IN THE TRUNK AND FINDING THE BULLET, WE THOUGHT THAT RHONDA WAS, YOU KNOW, INJURED VERY SEVERELY AND DIDN'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS. MAYBE SHE'S DEAD, MAYBE NOT. EITHER WAY, WE GOT TO FIND HER. EXPECT ME TO HELP YOU WITH THAT? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. WHERE IS SHE? I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW. WENT OVER MY AUNT'S HOUSE, HAD A COUPLE DRINKS. Narrator: HARLAN PLAYS DUMB, FIRST SAYING HE PASSED OUT AT HIS AUNT'S HOME THAT NIGHT AFTER A DRINKING BINGE, THEN CLAIMING HE HAD A RENDEZVOUS WITH HIS ESTRANGED WIFE. LET'S SEE. FIRST YOU SAY YOU DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE. SO NOW YOU WENT AND SAW YOUR WIFE? Moriarty: HE WAS GONNA MAKE YOU WORK FOR WHAT HE HAD. THIS WAS CALCULATED. THIS WAS MANIPULATIVE. THIS WAS CONTROLLING. THIS WAS ABOUT POWER. AND HE FELT HE HAD IT. Narrator: AFTER HOURS OF INTERROGATION, HE FINALLY ADMITS HE HAD SEEN THE VICTIM THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED. SHE WAS TRYING TO BUY SOME DRUGS. SHE'S GOT A BAD HABIT. Grant: HE SAID HE HAD ARRANGED TO MEET RHONDA AND SELL HER $500 WORTH OF COCAINE AND THEY HAD, IN FACT, PARTIED TOGETHER AND DONE THE COCAINE. AND WHEN HE LEFT HER, SHE WAS ALIVE. Narrator: POLICE BELIEVE HE'S JUST TRYING TO EXPLAIN AWAY EVIDENCE AND WITNESS STATEMENTS. Carbone: THERE'S STILL AN URGENCY AND GUYS ARE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK ON IT. AND THEY CAN'T LET THAT GO BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S A KEY TO GET HER ALIVE. Narrator: THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY CHARGES ROBERT HARLAN WITH EIGHT FELONY COUNTS INCLUDING FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. Grant: WE FIGURED WE MIGHT NEVER FIND HER BODY. BUT WE CERTAINLY HAD ENOUGH INDICATION THAT SHE WAS DEAD AND WHERE SHE HAD DIED THAT IT WAS WORTH TAKING THE CHANCE TO FILE A CASE AGAINST HIM. WE FELT THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT GONNA LET THIS GUY GO. Narrator: HARLAN STONEWALLS. WITHOUT A BODY, A CONVICTION WILL BE DIFFICULT. THE SEARCH CONTINUES. THEN DETECTIVES GET CRUCIAL PIECES OF EVIDENCE FROM AN UNLIKELY SOURCE -- HARLAN'S OWN FATHER. HIS FATHER HANDS OVER A BAG OF EVIDENCE. IT'S THE GUN, IT'S HIS CELLPHONE, IT'S CLOTHING. IT'S CRITICAL, CRITICAL PIECES OF EVIDENCE THAT LATER DOWN THE ROAD, ALL HAVE RHONDA'S DNA ON THEM. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE FATHER IN HIM OR THE COP IN HIM THAT HAS TO RECOGNIZE NO ONE ELSE SHOULD GET HURT AT THE HANDS OF HIS SON. I GUESS WHEN YOU FINALLY HAVE THE BAG FULL OF EVIDENCE IN YOUR HANDS, WHAT DO YOU DO WITH IT? YOU EITHER BECOME A CO-CONSPIRATOR AND PART OF THE CRIME OR YOU REPORT THE CRIME. Narrator: RHONDA'S HORRIBLE PLIGHT CAPTURES THE PUBLIC'S SYMPATHY. McKinley: FIVE DAYS WENT BY, AND WE KNEW THAT SEARCHERS WERE OUT THERE, NOT LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS ALIVE BUT LOOKING FOR A BODY. Narrator: AT LAST, SHE IS FOUND... BEATEN AND SHOT THREE TIMES. DEFENSIVE WOUNDS ON HER HANDS PROVE THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO ALWAYS WANTED TO BE A COP DIDN'T GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT. SHE FOUGHT TO THE END FOR HER SURVIVAL, HOPING FOR ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE. SHE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MADE A GREAT COP, YOU KNOW? REALLY BRAVE, YOU KNOW, SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS KIND OF A WARRIOR-TYPE. PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB. Narrator: TOXICOLOGY PROVES ROBERT HARLAN LIED ABOUT RHONDA DOING COCAINE WITH HIM. Grant: SHE HAD MINIMAL ALCOHOL IN HER BLOOD. SHE HAD NO DRUGS OF ANY KIND -- NO COCAINE, NOTHING. HIS STATEMENT WAS B.S., JUST DESIGNED TO EXCULPATE HIM AS MUCH AS HE COULD. Narrator: DETECTIVES LIFT HARLAN'S FINGERPRINTS FROM RHONDA'S WALLET. THE 9mm TURNED IN BY HIS FATHER MATCHES SLUGS PULLED FROM JACKIE CREAZZO'S CAR. ON JUNE 1, 1995, DEFENSE ATTORNEYS SHOCK THE COURT BY ADMITTING THEIR CLIENT DID KILL RHONDA BRADSHAW. THEY ARGUE IT WAS AN IMPULSIVE AFTERTHOUGHT, NOT PREMEDITATED MURDER. THE PROSECUTION'S KEY WITNESS IS JACKIE CREAZZO. SHE TELLS THE JURY ABOUT BEING CHASED DOWN AND SHOT AND ABOUT HARLAN RECAPTURING RHONDA. Moriarty: YOU GOT THE FEELING, WHEN ALL THE EVIDENCE STARTED COMING TOGETHER, THAT THIS WAS PREMEDITATED AND THAT HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT HE WAS DOING. MOST HEROES ARE RELUCTANT TO SHINE THE LIGHT UPON THEMSELVES. BUT JACKIE DESERVES THE LIGHT. SHE'S A ROLE MODEL. I HAVE A LOT OF ADMIRATION FOR JACKIE CREAZZO. WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS WHY. WHY DID IT HAVE TO TURN OUT THIS WAY? WHY DID HE HAVE TO DO WHAT HE DID? AND REALLY, HE HAS NO ANSWER. HE HAS NO ANSWER, AT LEAST, THAT WOULD SATISFY ME. Roan: "WE, THE JURY, UNANIMOUSLY FIND BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT DEATH IS THE APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT IN THIS CASE." Narrator: THE JURY CONVICTS ROBERT HARLAN ON ALL CHARGES, DELIVERING A DEATH SENTENCE FOR RHONDA'S MURDER... AND 144 YEARS FOR THE ATTEMPTED MURDER... [ GUNSHOT ] ...OF JACKIE CREAZZO. NEARLY 10 YEARS LATER, AN APPELLATE COURT REDUCES HIS SENTENCE TO LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. Grant: I STILL THINK ROBERT HARLAN SHOULD LOOK THE DEVIL IN THE EYE, AND EVENTUALLY HE WILL. IT'S LIFE IN PRISON. IT'S NATURAL LIFE. SO HE'LL DIE IN PRISON. BUT HE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED THE ULTIMATE SANCTION. Narrator: LARIMER COUNTY INVESTIGATORS HOPE TO ONE DAY DELIVER JUSTICE FOR JESSICA ARREDONDO. I'M ABSOLUTELY CONVINCED THAT ROBERT HARLAN IS INVOLVED IN KILLING AND DISPOSING OF THE BODY OF JESSICA ARREDONDO. Narrator: POLICE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO THE SECOND MAN WAS IN THAT CRIME. AND I BELIEVE THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT ROBERT HARLAN COULD BE CHARGED WITH OTHER HOMICIDES, POTENTIALLY, ESPECIALLY WITH THE DNA POTENTIAL THAT EXISTS NOW THAT DID NOT EXIST THEN. Grant: HE WAS A PREDATOR FROM EARLY ON. AND HE TURNED FROM BEING A SEXUAL PREDATOR INTO BEING A HOMICIDAL SEXUAL PREDATOR. Narrator: A PREDATOR WHO RIPPED RHONDA BRADSHAW AWAY FROM HER FAMILY. McKinley: THIS BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN, YOU KNOW, SHE STILL HAD HER LIFE AHEAD OF HER. SHE WAS A MOM. SHE HAD KIDS. SHE WANTED TO SERVE, AND SHE NEVER GOT THAT CHANCE.
