 Narrator: ITS SNOW-CAPPED PEAKS BECKON SURVIVALISTS, HUNTERS, AND THRILL-SEEKERS... ...LIKE 24-YEAR-OLD PEYTON TUTHILL. IN 1998, SHE LEAVES THE SANDY SHORES OF FLORIDA TO EMBRACE DENVER'S ICY CHALLENGE. PEYTON BELONGED IN A RUGGED PLACE BECAUSE SHE WAS TOUGH. I MEAN, SHE WAS STRONG, PHYSICALLY. SHE WAS A TOUGH GIRL. Narrator: SHE MOVES TO THE MILE-HIGH CITY WITH HER BEST FRIEND, HEATHER. THE THING WITH COLORADO -- IT GETS IN YOUR BLOOD THAT YOU WANT TO GET UP, YOU WANT TO GO OUTSIDE, YOU WANT TO GO HAVE FUN AND BE HEALTHY AND EXERCISE. I MEAN, WE LOVED IT. Narrator: VERY QUICKLY, EVERYTHING SEEMS TO CLICK INTO PLACE -- NEW HOUSE, NEW JOB ON THE HORIZON, AND A NEW BOYFRIEND SHE ADORES -- EVAN PAULSON. Nelson Goldwater: THEY FELL HEAD-OVER-HEELS IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER. SHE WAS CRAZY ABOUT HIM, AND HE WAS CRAZY ABOUT HER. I SHOULD PROBABLY GO CHECK ON MAGGIE AND GET CHANGED. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. BUT I'LL SEE YOU LATER. TAKE CARE. Narrator: IT'S THE KIND OF LIFE SHE'S ALWAYS DREAMED OF -- UNTIL FEBRUARY 24, 1999... WHEN EVERYTHING CHANGES. 1,800 MILES AWAY IN SUNNY FLORIDA, HER MOTHER HAS A PREMONITION THAT SENDS AN ICY SHIVER DOWN HER SPINE. ALL OF A SUDDEN, I WAS WASHED WITH THIS THOUGHT -- "WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO PEYTON?" AND I THOUGHT, "OH, I GUESS I'M JUST MISSING HER." Narrator: SHE HAS NO WAY TO KNOW THE EVIL HER DAUGHTER IS ABOUT TO FACE. JUST AFTER HER BIG JOB INTERVIEW, PEYTON STOPS BY THE HOUSE TO LET THE DOG OUT... [ MAGGIE BARKING ] MAGGIE, I'M HOME! Narrator:...BEFORE MEETING HER BOYFRIEND FOR DINNER. IT'S OKAY, MAGGIE. Narrator: SHE THINKS THE HOUSE IS EMPTY. Tuthill: EVERYBODY WAS ANXIOUS TO KNOW HOW HER JOB INTERVIEW WAS. I CALLED HER THAT NIGHT AND DIDN'T GET AN ANSWER. AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, SHE'S OUT CELEBRATING WITH HER FRIENDS." Narrator: LATER THAT EVENING, ONE OF PEYTON'S ROOMMATES, ALEXANDER PECK, CONTACTS POLICE. HE MAKES A PHONE CALL, SAYING, "HEY, UH... MY HOUSE HAS BEEN BURGLARIZED." Narrator: A DENVER OFFICER ARRIVES MINUTES LATER. FOLLOWING PROTOCOL, HE INSTRUCTS PECK TO JOIN HIM TO POINT OUT ANY MISSING ITEMS. BUT, ONCE INSIDE, THIS IS NO SIMPLE BURGLARY. [ MAGGIE BARKING ] THERE'S A TRAIL OF BLOODY FOOTPRINTS FROM THE KITCHEN UP THE STAIRS. IS THAT YOUR DOG? IT'S -- IT'S PEYTON'S. [ BARKING CONTINUES ] ON THE SECOND FLOOR, PECK POINTS OUT MORE BLOOD AT THE DOOR TO HIS ROOM. OFFICER? IN THE CORNER, THE BATTERED BODY... OF PEYTON TUTHILL. I ALWAYS BEGIN WHERE THE SUBJECT MAY HAVE ENTERED THE HOME, WHICH IS THROUGH THE BACK DOOR. AND I BEGAN ANALYZING IT. AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT I NOTICED IS THERE IS THIS PIECE OF DOOR FRAME THAT IS MISSING FROM THE DOOR. WHY WOULD SOMEBODY TAKE THAT WITH THEM? WHY WOULD THEY KEEP THAT? AND I THOUGHT, "WHERE IS THIS? IT SHOULD BE HERE, AND IT'S NOT HERE." THE TRASH CAN DIDN'T HAVE A LINER IN IT, BUT THE TRASH CAN IS SPARKLING CLEAN. AND I KNEW THAT THERE WERE TWO FEMALES WHO LIVED IN THIS HOUSE. AND I JUST KNOW THAT THERE IS NO WAY THAT THAT TRASH CAN IS NOT GONNA HAVE A LINER IN IT. BUT THERE'S NONE IN THERE. IT'S NOT THERE. OVER ON THE COUNTER, THERE'S A SIX-PACK CONTAINER FOR BEER. NEXT TO THAT IS A BOTTLE OF BEER. THE FACT THAT I HAD A BEER BOTTLE WRAPPED WITH PAPER TOWEL TELLS ME I HAVE SOMEBODY THAT'S TRYING TO HIDE THEIR FINGERPRINTS. Narrator: DROPS OF BLOOD DOT THE WASHING MACHINE, AND BLOODY WATER STILL POOLS INSIDE, AS IF THE KILLER TOOK THE TIME TO WASH SOME CLOTHES AFTER THE ATTACK. IT'S SCARY TO CONTEMPLATE THAT SOMEBODY CAN BE JUST SORT OF THAT COMPLACENT THAT THEY WOULD STAY IN THE HOME AND DO LAUNDRY. Priest: THOSE ARE ALL TRAITS OF SOMEBODY KNOWN TO THE VICTIM. THOSE ARE ALL TRAITS OF SOMEBODY THAT REALLY IS IN A LOW-RISK POSITION, BECAUSE, "I KNOW HOW THINGS WORK AROUND HERE." Narrator: INVESTIGATORS START LOOKING CLOSE TO HOME -- AT HER ROOMMATES. HERE WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE I HAVE TWO FEMALE ROOMMATES AND A MALE ROOMMATE. THERE MAY CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING GOING ON JUST BETWEEN THESE INDIVIDUALS, AND THAT MAY BE THE CATALYST FOR WHAT OCCURRED. THERE'S NOTHING HERE THAT TELLS ME A FEMALE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CRIME. Narrator: THING IS, HEATHER NELSON DOESN'T APPEAR TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE MURDER. AND I RAN IN AND I SAID, "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU PEOPLE DOING HERE?" I WAS FLIPPING OUT. AND THEY SAID, "WHO ARE YOU?" AND I SAID, "I'M HEATHER AND I LIVE HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?" AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, I WAS QUARANTINED INTO A COP CAR. THEY TOLD ME THAT WE HAD BEEN ROBBED AND THAT PEYTON WASN'T COMING DOWNSTAIRS. AND I KEPT SAYING, "IF YOU LET ME TALK TO HER, I'LL GET HER DOWNSTAIRS. DON'T WORRY. I WILL GET HER DOWNSTAIRS." OUR ROOMMATE WAS ON THE BACK PORCH, AND THEY WERE QUESTIONING HIM. AND I SAID, "WHAT HAPPENED?" I MEAN, I'M SCREAMING AT THIS TIME, 'CAUSE YOU'RE FLIPPING OUT. AND HE SAID, "PEYTON'S UPSTAIRS, AND THERE'S BLOOD." Narrator: DETECTIVES NOTE PEYTON WASN'T FOUND MURDERED IN HER OWN BEDROOM, BUT HER MALE ROOMMATE'S. YOUR FIRST WITNESS IS USUALLY YOUR FIRST SUSPECT. I HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL, A MALE, WHO MAKES A PHONE CALL TELLING THE POLICE, "MY HOUSE HAS BEEN BURGLARIZED." UNIFORMED OFFICERS SHOW UP. THEY SEARCH THE HOUSE AND FIND A BODY INSIDE THE BEDROOM OF THE VERY PERSON WHO JUST MADE THAT PHONE CALL. YEAH, HE'S RIGHT AT THE TOP OF MY LIST. Narrator: POLICE TAKE BOTH ROOMMATES TO THE STATION FOR MORE QUESTIONING AND TO GET DNA SAMPLES. AND HEATHER FINALLY LEARNS WHAT HAPPENED. A DETECTIVE COMES IN -- AND I DON'T REMEMBER HIS NAME -- AND HE SAID, "MISS NELSON, I'M REALLY SORRY THAT THIS IS TAKING SO LONG, BUT THIS IS STANDARD IN ANY MURDER CASE." AND I,"WHAT? SHE'S DEAD?" AND THEN I STARTED BAWLING AND SCREAMING AND I RAN OUT OF THE ROOM AND I LOOKED UP AND THERE WAS A DRY-ERASE BOARD [Voice breaking] WITH HER NAME ON IT THAT SAID "MURDERED -- FEMALE." [ SNIFFLES ] THEY SAID, "WE NEED YOUR DNA." AND THEN THAT'S WHEN IT HIT ME THAT MAYBE THEY WERE JUST THINKING I DID IT, TOO. Narrator: FAR AWAY IN FLORIDA, PAT TUTHILL IS STILL EAGERLY AWAITING A CALL FROM HER DAUGHTER ABOUT HER JOB INTERVIEW. INSTEAD OF PEYTON'S VOICE ON THE PHONE, SHE GETS THE WORST NEWS A MOTHER CAN EVER HEAR. Tuthill: THE ROOM WAS SILENT. I KNEW, AT THAT MOMENT, SOMETHING HAPPENED -- AND I FELT IT -- TO ONE OF MY DAUGHTERS. AND THEN SOMEONE SAID, "PEYTON." IT'S PEYTON. IS SHE HURT? I SAID, "WAS SHE SKIING? WHAT? DID SHE HAVE A FALL?" AND THEIR HEADS WERE SHAKING NO. [ SIGHS ] AND AFTER A FEW DEEP BREATHS, I SCREAMED, "SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME!" AND THE WORDS CAME OUT -- "SHE'S BEEN KILLED." [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] Narrator: AT THE BASE OF THE RUGGED ROCKIES, IN THE THIN, COLD AIR OF WINTER, DENVER POLICE INVESTIGATE THE BRUTAL MURDER OF PEYTON TUTHILL. Ritter, Jr.: I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF MURDER SCENES. I'VE TRIED A LOT OF MURDER CASES, SEEN PHOTOGRAPHS OF CASES, AND IT WAS JUST HORRIFIC WHAT HAD BEEN DONE TO PEYTON TUTHILL. SAVAGERY, BUTCHERY, HORRIFIC -- THOSE KINDS OF WORDS COME TO MIND. Narrator: AN AUTOPSY REVEALS HER ATTACKER SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER, SLIT HER THROAT, AND PLUNGED A 12-INCH BLADE INTO HER 17 TIMES, PUNCTURING HER HEART. THE SEXUAL ASSAULT OBVIOUSLY RULES ROOMMATE HEATHER NELSON OUT AS A SUSPECT. [ SCREAMING ] DEFENSIVE WOUNDS SHOW PEYTON NEVER GAVE UP. THERE WAS A HUGE STRUGGLE. PEYTON REALLY FOUGHT FOR HER LIFE. SHE FOUGHT BACK, WHICH IS TOTALLY IN LINE WITH PEYTON, BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT A PASSIVE PERSON. AND IT ALL MADE SENSE TO US WHEN WE HEARD THAT. Narrator: HER TENACITY KEPT HER ALIVE LONGER THAN ANYONE COULD HAVE IMAGINED. SHE SURVIVED THE ASSAULT, ONLY TO BLEED TO DEATH AS HER ATTACKER WASHED UP DOWNSTAIRS. I WAS TRYING TO THINK, "WHO WOULD WANT TO MURDER HER? WHO WOULD WANT TO? WHY?" IT WAS BEYOND ANYTHING I COULD IMAGINE. Narrator: HOW COULD SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIFE COME TO SUCH A VIOLENT END? THERE WAS A MOTTO THAT PEYTON LIVED BY, AND THAT WAS, "WE CAN WATCH THINGS HAPPEN, OR WE CAN MAKE THEM HAPPEN." AND SHE WAS ONE TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN. Narrator: PEYTON ALWAYS DREAMED OF GOING OUT WEST, ASKING FOR A COURSE AT THE NATIONAL OUTDOOR LEADERSHIP SCHOOL IN WYOMING AS A COLLEGE-GRADUATION PRESENT. SHE RODE HORSEBACK ALONG THE SNOWY TRAILS OF THE GRAND TETONS AND LEARNED OUTDOOR SURVIVAL IN UNFORGIVING TERRAIN. IN THE COLD AND SNOW, SHE FOUND HERSELF. IT'S FUNNY, 'CAUSE SHE'S COVERED IN SNOW. AND WHEN MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN MISERABLE, SHE THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST. YOU COULD TELL BY THAT SMILE ON HER FACE. SHE ALWAYS HAD THAT SMILE, NO MATTER WHAT. Tuthill: THAT'S WHY I LOVE -- THAT PICTURE WAS REALLY PART OF HER EXPLORATION AND TO FIND OUT WHAT SHE WAS REALLY CAPABLE OF AND WHAT SHE COULD DO. Narrator: WHEN SHE GOT HOME, SHE TALKED HEATHER INTO A COLORADO VACATION. Nelson Goldwater: WE SPENT A WEEK TRAVELING, GOING TO BRECKENRIDGE, BOULDER, YOU NAME IT. AND WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER ONE NIGHT WHEN WE WERE DRIVING, AND SHE SAID, "LET'S DO THIS. LET'S MOVE HERE." [ PROJECTOR WHIRRING ] Narrator: THREE WEEKS LATER, THEY PACKED UP THEIR LIVES AND THEIR BRAND-NEW WINTER WEAR AND LEFT THE SUNNY SOUTH FOR THE WILD WEST. GIRLS... WE'RE GETTING THERE! ...YOU BE CAREFUL. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU EVERY DAY. YOU HEAR ME? EVERY DAY. [ CAR DOOR CLOSES, ENGINE TURNS OVER ] Narrator: PEYTON FOUND A VICTORIAN DUPLEX FOR RENT. IT MIGHT HAVE SEEMED REALLY NICE THAT SHE GOT HER VICTORIAN HOME, AND I BET SHE WAS EXCITED ABOUT IT, BUT SHE MIGHT NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE WAS A BLOCK AWAY FROM ONE OF COLORADO'S REHAB CENTERS. YOU KNOW, GAVE HER MY BLESSING, AND I STRUGGLED WITH THAT. I THOUGHT ONCE, "WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD FLY OUT THERE AND LOOK AT THE HOUSE AND LOOK AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD." AND THEN I HAD TO STEP BACK AS A MOM AND SAY, "OKAY. I HAVE TO LET HER START MAKING HER OWN DECISIONS." [ CHUCKLES ] OH, MY GOODNESS! HEY, GUYS. CHECK ME OUT. OH, MY GOD. YOU LOOK SO CUTE! [ WHISTLES ] Narrator: PEYTON EASED HER MOTHERS'S CONCERNS WHEN SHE AND HEATHER FOUND A MALE ROOMMATE -- ALEXANDER PECK. PECK MOVED TO DENVER FROM GEORGIA AND WORKED FOR A CAR-RENTAL COMPANY. Nelson Goldwater: ACTUALLY, WE MET HIM IN A BAR. AND HE WAS STAYING WITH A PAIR OF FRIENDS THAT HAD MOVED OUT THERE, AND HE NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY. SO, WE ALL GOT -- IT WAS LIKE "THREE'S COMPANY" KIND OF IDEA. Narrator: THEN SHE MET EVAN PAULSON AND SKATED INTO AN INTENSE COURTSHIP. HE WAS A COLORADO NATIVE. SO HE WAS ABLE TO TAKE HER TO PLACES THAT SHE'D NEVER SEEN AND ENJOY PARTS OF COLORADO. Narrator: EVERYTHING WAS WORKING OUT. I REMEMBER THAT NIGHT, BEFORE, ON FEBRUARY 23rd. SHE CAME INTO MY ROOM, AND SHE WAS EXCITED ABOUT THIS INTERVIEW -- SO EXCITED. AND I SAID, "YOU'RE SO GONNA GET IT." AND SHE'S LIKE, "THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT. OUR LIFE IS SO GREAT." AND WE HUGGED EACH OTHER, AND THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I EVER SAW HER. [ PROJECTOR WHIRRING ] Narrator: AFTER THE MURDER, HEATHER NOTICES SEVERAL ITEMS MISSING FROM THE HOUSE, INCLUDING HER BOYFRIEND'S BLUE COAT, A BLACK SHOPPING BAG, AND A LARGE PILE OF LOOSE COINS. EVIDENCE TECHS DETERMINE THE BLOODY SHOE PRINTS COME FROM A COMMON BRAND OF TENNIS SHOE. IF DETECTIVES FIND A SUSPECT WITH THOSE SHOES, THEY COULD CHECK FOR A MATCH. THE RAPE SWABS AND PEYTON'S FINGERNAIL SCRAPINGS OFFER EVEN MORE CLUES. THEIR DNA CAME FROM THE SAME PERSON, AND IT MATCHES THE DNA RECOVERED FROM THE BEER BOTTLE IN THE KITCHEN. SO, WHOSE DNA IS IT? ALEXANDER PECK IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST. McKinley: WELL, THINGS ARE LOOKING PRETTY SUSPICIOUS EARLY ON, BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE WHO MADE THE FIRST CALL, AND THE BODY'S FOUND NOT IN HER OWN BEDROOM BUT IN HIS. Priest: YOU KNOW, "I DIDN'T DO IT," MAY BE THE FIRST RESPONSE OUT OF HIS MOUTH. BUT, AGAIN, I'VE TALKED TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY DIDN'T DO IT, AND IT TURNED OUT THEY DID. Narrator: AND WHAT ABOUT PEYTON'S NEW BOYFRIEND, EVAN PAULSON? HAD HIS ADORATION TURNED INTO OBSESSION? McKinley: PEYTON DIDN'T HAVE YOUR NORMAL LIVING SITUATION IN THAT SHE HAD A MALE ROOMMATE, YET SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND. POLICE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS A LOVE TRIANGLE, WHERE SOMEONE GOT JEALOUS AND DECIDED TO KILL HER TO KEEP HER FROM LOVING SOMEONE ELSE. Narrator: PEYTON'S BOYFRIEND ADMITS TO BEING THE LAST KNOWN PERSON TO SEE HER ALIVE. HE TELLS POLICE SHE MET HIM FOR LUNCH AFTER HER JOB INTERVIEW. HE WAS PLANNING TO TREAT HER TO A CELEBRATORY DINNER THAT EVENING AT 5:00. SHE NEVER SHOWED. Priest: COULD THIS BE A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE? COULD A BOYFRIEND COME OVER TO THE HOUSE, FORCE ENTRY INTO THE HOME, GET IN AN ARGUMENT, AND KILL HER IN A RAGE AND NOT FEEL A BIG URGE TO HAVE TO LEAVE BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHAT THE SCHEDULES ARE OF THE OTHER TWO ROOMMATES? COULD THAT BE A POSSIBILITY? Narrator: INVESTIGATORS COLLECT HIS DNA, TOO. IT DOES NOT MATCH THE MATERIAL FROM THE CRIME SCENE, AND NEITHER DOES ROOMMATE ALEXANDER PECK'S. WITH THOSE CLOSEST TO PEYTON RULED OUT, DETECTIVES EXPAND THEIR INVESTIGATION OUTWARD. McKinley: POLICE HAD A LOT TO CHECK OUT. THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE THIS. Narrator: THEY INTERVIEW NEIGHBORS AND GET AN IMPORTANT TIP. [ PROJECTOR WHIRRING ] A PASSERBY SAYS SHE SAW SOMEONE NEAR PEYTON'S HOME AROUND 1:00 THAT AFTERNOON. SHE SAW A BLACK MALE THAT WAS LEAVING THE HOME AND WALKING NEAR THE TRASH DUMPSTERS WHO WAS WEARING A BLUE JACKET. Narrator: THE EYEWITNESS SAYS HE WAS ABOUT 6'1", A LITTLE OVER 200 POUNDS. SHE HELPS DEVELOP A COMPOSITE SKETCH, THOUGH INVESTIGATORS STILL HAVE NO SUSPECTS TO COMPARE IT TO. POLICE REVISIT THE CLUES, STILL PUZZLED BY THE MISSING LINER IN THE KITCHEN TRASH. DETECTIVES WIDEN THEIR SEARCH FOR EVIDENCE. Priest: I STARTED LOOKING THROUGH THE DUMPSTERS, AND THE SECOND DUMPSTER THAT I CAME TO, I FOUND A PLASTIC TRASH BAG. I SAID, "THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR." AND I HIT THE JACKPOT WITH THAT. McKinley: UNFORTUNATELY FOR THE KILLER, IT WASN'T TRASH DAY. IT WAS A TRASH BAG FULL OF CLUES -- A MOLDING FROM THE DOOR WHEN THE KILLER BROKE INTO THE HOUSE, THE KEYS TO PEYTON'S CAR, AND A GREY SWEATSHIRT COVERED WITH BLOOD. THE SWEATSHIRT WAS SOAKING WET. Priest: THAT'S WHEN I MADE THE CONNECTION TO THE WASHING MACHINE -- THAT THIS LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY HAS LAUNDERED IT IN SOME FASHION. Narrator: THE CLUES KEEP COMING. WE FOUND A WHITE HAND TOWEL THAT HAD BLOOD ON IT, AND INSIDE THE WHITE HAND TOWEL WAS A KNIFE. Narrator: AMONG THIS CRUCIAL NEW EVIDENCE -- THE SWEATSHIRT'S CLOTHING TAG. THE MOST INTERESTING PART ABOUT THE CLOTHING TAG WAS THE NAME THAT WAS WRITTEN ON THE TAG. Narrator: A GUT INSTINCT ABOUT A MISSING TRASH BAG HAS BROUGHT THEM TO EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEEDED -- A NAME. IVAN COFFER. IT'S JUST THAT, "AHA! I KNEW IT. I KNEW THAT THIS WAS IMPORTANT." AND THERE IT WAS. [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] Narrator: DENVER POLICE HOPE TO CATCH THE BRAZEN SEXUAL PREDATOR WHO MURDERED PEYTON TUTHILL. Priest: I'VE LOOKED AT A LOT OF HOMICIDE CASES, AND UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO PUT THEMSELVES INTO BAD POSITIONS IN LIFE. THEIR LIFESTYLE TENDED TO PUT THEM AT A HIGHER RISK THAN OTHER PEOPLE. PEYTON DIDN'T DO THAT TO HERSELF. PEYTON WAS IN A GROUP THAT WE USUALLY IDENTIFY AS TRUE VICTIMS, MEANING THAT SHE WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO LIVE A LIFE. Narrator: DETECTIVES FOCUS ON THE NAME TAG FROM A BLOOD-STAINED SWEATSHIRT FOUND WITH THE MURDER WEAPON. YOU COULDN'T WRITE FICTION BETTER THAN THIS, BUT IT WAS REALLY HAPPENING. I MEAN, THEY HAD ALL THESE CLUES THAT TIED THE KILLER TO THE MURDER, INCLUDING A NAME. NEITHER PEYTON'S FAMILY NOR FRIENDS RECOGNIZED THE NAME ON THE TAG -- IVAN COFFER. WE KNEW THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAD A HALFWAY HOUSE JUST A COUPLE DOORS DOWN FROM OUR VICTIM'S DUPLEX. IT WAS A DRUG-REHABILITATION PLACE, WHERE THEY TOOK PEOPLE WHO HAD PROBLEMS INSIDE THE CRIMINAL-JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ALSO HAD SUBSTANCE-ABUSE PROBLEMS, IN ORDER TO GET THEM CLEAN AND SOBER. YOU KNOW, "THIS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT HALFWAY HOUSE." SO WE WENT DOWN AND KNOCKED ON THEIR DOOR. Narrator: SURE ENOUGH, THE THIRD NAME ON THE CENTER'S CLIENT LIST IS IVAN COFFER. IMMEDIATELY, WE'RE LOOKING AT EACH OTHER THINKING, "IT CAN'T BE THIS EASY. WE CAN'T BE SOLVING THIS CRIME THIS EASY." Narrator: HAD COFFER GROWN OBSESSED WITH THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL NEXT DOOR... ...THEN WAITED FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT TO POUNCE? DETECTIVES BRING HIM IN FOR QUESTIONING. HE TELLS US THAT HE WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY HOMICIDE, HE DID NOT BREAK INTO ANYBODY'S HOME. Narrator: EVEN SO, HE SEEMS TO MATCH THE EYE-WITNESS DESCRIPTION OF THE MAN IN THE BLUE JACKET SEEN BEHIND PEYTON'S HOUSE. HE IS A BLACK MALE. HE'S ABOUT 6'1", WEIGHS ABOUT 230 POUNDS. Narrator: DETECTIVES SEARCH HIS ROOM. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] HEY, DETECTIVE? Priest: HE HAD PUT HIS NAME IN EVERYTHING. IT WAS IN HIS SHORTS, IN HIS T- SHIRTS, IN HIS JACKETS -- EVERYTHING HAD HIS NAME ON IT. "WHY DO I HAVE YOUR SHIRT AT MY CRIME SCENE?" HE SAYS, "I DON'T HAVE THAT SHIRT ANYMORE." I SAYS, "WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T HAVE THAT SHIRT ANYMORE?" HE SAYS, "WELL, I GAVE THE SHIRT AWAY." RIGHT. SURE YOU DID. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS BOOK HIM AND OBTAIN DNA SAMPLES. POLICE LEARN COFFER WAS SENTENCED TO 12 YEARS IN MARYLAND ON DRUG CHARGES. HE ONLY SERVED A YEAR BEFORE THE COURT ORDERED HIM TO COMPLETE THE DRUG AND ALCOHOL TREATMENT PROGRAM IN COLORADO AS A CONDITION OF EARLY RELEASE. Tuthill: I WAS OUTRAGED. NO ONE WAS REALLY AWARE OF THE TYPE OF RESIDENTS THAT WERE MOVING INTO THE HALFWAY HOUSE -- WERE NOT AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THEY WERE CONVICTS. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS NOW HOPE DNA WILL SPELL JUSTICE FOR PEYTON. WE HAD A SLAM-DUNK CASE. WE KNEW THAT. Narrator: WHEN THE RESULTS COME BACK, THE SLAM DUNK BECOMES A TECHNICAL FOUL. THE GENETICIST TOLD ME THAT THE DNA DIDN'T MATCH. AND I SAID, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT DIDN'T MATCH?" "WE HAVE THIS INDIVIDUAL'S NAME TAG FROM HIS CLOTHES "WRAPPED AROUND OUR MURDER WEAPON. "WE HAVE AN EYEWITNESS THAT PUTS HIM AT THE SCENE "AT THE TIME OF THE HOMICIDE. "WHAT DO YOU MEAN IT DOESN'T MATCH? IT'S GOT TO MATCH. YOU MADE A MISTAKE. DO IT AGAIN." AND HE TELLS ME, "I'M TELLING YOU THAT IT'S NOT HIM." Narrator: IVAN COFFER WALKS OUT OF JAIL A FREE MAN. WHEN THE DETECTIVES TOLD US IT WASN'T THE RIGHT GUY, THEN YOU GET REALLY SCARED, 'CAUSE YOU THINK THAT PERSON'S STILL OUT THERE. AND IT SCARED US TO DEATH. [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] Narrator: AFTER THE SLAYING OF 24-YEAR-OLD PEYTON TUTHILL, DENVER POLICE FIND IVAN COFFER'S NAME WITH THE MURDER WEAPON. BUT DNA TESTING CLEARS HIM AS A SUSPECT. COFFER ADDS A TWIST BY TELLING POLICE HE GAVE A SWEATSHIRT WITH HIS NAME IN IT TO ANOTHER RESIDENT OF THE SAME HALFWAY HOUSE -- A GUY NAMED FRANK MACKLIN. Priest: HE SAYS, "I CAN PROVE IT." I SAID, "WELL, HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT?" AND HE SAYS, "WELL, WHEN YOU'RE IN A HALFWAY-HOUSE SETTING, "IF YOU GIVE CLOTHING AWAY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT, "YOU HAVE TO FILL OUT A FORM SO THAT NO ONE CAN ACCUSE YOU OF STEALING SOMEBODY ELSE'S STUFF." SO, YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS TRANSFER THING. AND SURE ENOUGH, WE CHECKED AT THE HALFWAY HOUSE, AND THERE'S A TRANSFER FORM FOR THIS STUFF. SO I HAVE A BRAND-NEW SUSPECT AT THIS POINT. HE'S A BLACK MALE. HE IS 6'1". HE WEIGHS 220 POUNDS. THIS GUY LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE OUR COMPOSITE DRAWING CREATED BY OUR WITNESS THAT SAW THE INDIVIDUAL OUTSIDE THE HOME. Narrator: MACKLIN WAS PAROLED TO THE DENVER HALFWAY HOUSE AFTER A LONG PRISON STINT ON DRUG CHARGES. CRIMINAL RECORD ISN'T DISPOSITIVE OF ANYTHING, BUT YOU LOOK AT THAT WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DECIDE WHO'S A GOOD SUSPECT IN A MURDER CASE. YOU ALWAYS PULL A RECORD, AND HIS WAS PRETTY LENGTHY. Narrator: LIKE COFFER, MACKLIN CLAIMS HE DIDN'T HAVE THE SWEATSHIRT AT THE TIME. HE SAYS HE GOT KICKED OUT OF THE REHAB PROGRAM TWO DAYS BEFORE PEYTON'S MURDER. THE CENTER BAGGED UP HIS STUFF, WHICH WAS STOLEN BEFORE HE COULD CLAIM IT. AND MISSING FROM THAT BAG WAS THAT SWEATSHIRT. I SAID, "IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?" AND HE SAYS, "UM...YEAH. "A PAIR OF GRAY, BLACK, AND YELLOW TENNIS SHOES. THOSE ARE MISSING, AS WELL." Narrator: THE SAME BRAND THAT LEFT THE BLOODY PRINTS AT THE SCENE. NOW I HAVE A DOUBLE CONNECTION -- NOT ONLY DOES THE SHIRT CONNECT ME TO THAT HALFWAY HOUSE, BUT NOW THESE SHOES DO. Narrator: MACKLIN CLAIMS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO COMMIT THE MURDER. HE SPENT THAT DAY IN JAIL ON A MINOR CHARGE AND DIDN'T GET RELEASED UNTIL THE NEXT DAY. Woman: OPEN YOUR MOUTH A LITTLE BIT WIDER SO I CAN GET IN THERE. DETECTIVES COLLECT A DNA SAMPLE. YET AGAIN, IT DOESN'T MATCH. HE SAYS, "ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER, FEBRUARY 24th, HMM... I WAS IN JAIL." [ Chuckling ] AND HE WAS. THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD ALIBI. Narrator: ANOTHER SUSPECT CLEARED. BUT POLICE ARE CERTAIN THEY'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK, ZEROING IN ON THE KNOWN CRIMINALS WHO LIVE NEAR PEYTON. SOMEONE WITH CONTACT TO THIS HALFWAY HOUSE IS OUR SUSPECT. McKinley: POLICE START ASKING AROUND, AND PEOPLE AT THE HALFWAY HOUSE ARE TALKING ABOUT ONE RESIDENT. THIS NAME KEEPS POPPING UP BECAUSE THIS GUY IS A PHYSICAL AND VERBAL ABUSER. AND THE NAME IS DONTA PAGE. Priest: THEY JUST SAID, "YOU KNOW, HE'S A BAD GUY. "HE'S A BAD GUY. "HE'S SOMEBODY THAT YOU REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT. HE'S A BAD GUY." Narrator: A BACKGROUND CHECK REVEALS THAT, LIKE IVAN COFFER, A MARYLAND JUDGE RELEASED PAGE FROM A 10-YEAR SENTENCE FOR ARMED ROBBERY. HIS RAP SHEET WAS AS LONG AS I AM TALL. HE HAD BEEN IN JAIL NUMEROUS TIMES. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO STILL BE IN JAIL. AND HE GOT OUT. Narrator: FOUR MONTHS BEFORE PEYTON'S MURDER, HE WAS ORDERED TO COUNSELING AT THE DENVER HALFWAY HOUSE. I HAD SO MUCH ANGER. I WAS CALLING EVERY CITY OFFICIAL THAT I COULD GET THROUGH TO IN THE CITY OF DENVER, CHECKING ON LICENSING, HOW THIS HOUSE COULD BE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. I WAS VERY ANGRY. I WAS ANGRY AT THE WORLD. Narrator: BUT THERE'S A CATCH -- PAGE'S POLICE MUG SHOTS AND PHOTOS FROM THE CENTER DON'T MATCH THE DESCRIPTION FROM THE WITNESS. HERE'S A GUY THAT HAS A FULL BEARD AND HAS A FULL HEAD OF HAIR. I MEAN, HE'S COVERED IN HAIR. I'M SAYING, "IT CAN'T BE HIM." Narrator: MAYBE HE SHAVED AND CUT HIS HAIR. 22-YEAR-OLD DONTA PAGE WAS AT THE REHAB CENTER WHEN MACKLIN SAYS THE SWEATSHIRT AND SHOES WERE STOLEN. HE GOT KICKED OUT OF THE PROGRAM FOR ASSAULTING ANOTHER RESIDENT. Priest: I SAID, "WELL, WHEN DID HE LEAVE THE PROGRAM?" SAYS, "WELL, LET ME LOOK." AND THEY LOOK. AND THEY SAY, "WELL, HE GOT KICKED OUT ON THE 24th OF FEBRUARY." THE DAY OF OUR HOMICIDE... HE'S KICKED OUT OF THE PROGRAM. DONTA IS IN A BAD WAY AT THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT IN HIS LIFE. THERE'S A GOOD POSSIBILITY HE'S GONNA END UP GOING BACK TO PRISON. Narrator: A MAN WITH NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE IS A GOOD SUSPECT. THE REHAB CENTER'S STAFF EXPLAINS THEY ORDERED HIM TO GO BACK TO MARYLAND, WHERE HE WAS SUPPOSED TO REPORT TO PRISON. I KNOW HE HAD MADE THREATS TO ONE OF THE COUNSELORS THERE THAT MORNING. SO THEY GAVE HIM A BUS TICKET AND KICKED HIM OUT AT 8:00 A.M. AND HIS BUS TICKET WAS FOR 3:00, 4:00 IN THE AFTERNOON. WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GONNA DO BUT GET IN TROUBLE? Narrator: AND FOR PAGE, PERHAPS GETTING IN TROUBLE BEGAN WITH BREAKING INTO PEYTON'S HOME. McKinley: HE WAS GONNA GO BACK TO MARYLAND WITH NO MONEY. AND SO, PEYTON TUTHILL'S HOME WAS RIGHT THERE. SHE HAD NO IDEA SOMEONE WAS WATCHING HER. WELL, HE WAS. AND THAT MORNING, ON FEBRUARY 24th, THAT'S WHEN HE MADE HIS MOVE. [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] Narrator: DENVER POLICE SEEK DONTA PAGE IN CONNECTION WITH THE STABBING DEATH OF PEYTON TUTHILL. CANVASSING THE AREA, THEY FIND WITNESSES WHO SAW PAGE AT A BUS STOP AFTER THE MURDER. HE'S WEARING A BLUE JACKET. AND HE WAS CARRYING A BLACK SHOPPING BAG, AND THAT SHOPPING BAG SOUNDED AS IF IT HAD COINS IN IT. AND NOW WE KNOW -- THIS HAS GOT TO BE HIM. Narrator: HEATHER HAD REPORTED THE JACKET, BAG, AND COINS MISSING FROM THE HOUSE. INVESTIGATORS THINK PAGE HOPPED ON A BUS TO BALTIMORE. Narrator: PEYTON'S MOTHER CAN'T BELIEVE A CONVICTED CRIMINAL WAS SIMPLY ASKED TO GO BACK TO PRISON ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I WAS OUTRAGED ON THEIR RESPONSE OF SAYING, "WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A GREYHOUND BUS TICKET "AND YOU'RE GOING TO JUST GET ON THE BUS AND YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK TO MARYLAND AND YOU'RE GOING BACK TO PRISON." UNESCORTED. YEAH, YOU KNOW, HE COULD GET ON AND OFF ANYWHERE. Narrator: DETECTIVE PRIEST CONTACTS A BALTIMORE DETECTIVE AND LEARNS PAGE DID GO TO MARYLAND THE DAY OF THE DENVER MURDER, THOUGH PRISON WASN'T HIS FIRST STOP. Priest: HE SAYS, "OH, WELL. "DONTA, HE JUST GOT OFF THE BUS A COUPLE DAYS AGO, "COMING BACK FROM DENVER, "AND WALKED INTO A CHINESE RESTAURANT. AND WHILE HE'S IN THERE, HE STEALS THE CASH REGISTER." GET DOWN. GET DOWN! GET DOWN! "REALLY?" HE SAYS, "YEAH." "WHEN YOU SEE A GUY THAT BIG RUNNING DOWN THE STREET CARRYING A CASH REGISTER, YOU JUST KIND OF REMEMBER THAT." Narrator: ARRESTED FOR THAT ROBBERY, DONTA PAGE NOW SITS IN A MARYLAND JAIL. HIS DNA IS ALREADY ON FILE. WE HAD HIS DNA AND THEN HAD THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT HIS DNA AND COMPARE IT TO THE PERSON WHO ASSAULTED -- ULTIMATELY MURDERED -- PEYTON TUTHILL. WE WERE ABLE TO MATCH THE DNA. Narrator: DENVER AUTHORITIES RACE TO BALTIMORE TO INTERVIEW PAGE. FOR TWO HOURS, HE DENIES HE'D EVER SEEN PEYTON TUTHILL OR BEEN INSIDE HER HOUSE. I DON'T KNOW A PEYTON. LOOK FAMILIAR? Priest: I SAID, "I KNOW THAT YOU BROKE INTO THE HOUSE. I KNOW THAT YOU KILLED THE GIRL." AND I SHUT UP, AND I DIDN'T SAY ANOTHER WORD. AND IT FELT LIKE FOREVER. DOES THAT KITCHEN LOOK FAMILIAR? HE SHAKES HIS HEAD. HE LOOKS UP AT ME. HE SAYS, "DETECTIVE..." HE SAYS, "YOU DON'T HAVE TO PLAY WITH ME ANYMORE." A- ALL RIGHT, MAN. ALL RIGHT. I DID IT. ALL RIGHT? LISTEN -- S-SO WHAT? I DID IT. AND, I MEAN, I'M JUST JUMPING UP AND DOWN INSIDE. I JUST WANT TO RUN AROUND THE ROOM AND HIGH-FIVE EVERYBODY, "YES! I GOT HIM!" AND I HAVE TO MAINTAIN THAT DEMEANOR OF JUST LOOKING AT HIM. AT WHAT POINT IN THE EVENT... Narrator: HE CONFIRMS HE WAS KICKED OUT OF THE REHAB PROGRAM THAT MORNING AND GIVEN A BUS PASS BACK TO BALTIMORE. BEFORE THE BUS LEFT, HE HAD TIME ON HIS HANDS. HE HAD SEEN HIS PRETTY NEIGHBOR LEAVE EARLIER AND KNEW IT WAS SAFE TO BREAK INTO HER HOUSE TO STEAL SOME CASH. [ PROJECTOR WHIRRING ] WHEN PEYTON CAME HOME, HE WAS WAITING THERE FOR HER. [ CAR DOOR CLOSES ] HE GRABBED A BUTCHER KNIFE FROM THE KITCHEN. [ MAGGIE BARKING ] MAGGIE, I'M HOME! IT'S OKAY, MAGGIE. I'M COMING. IT'S OKAY. CALM DOWN. COME HERE! [ SCREAMS ] NO! [ BARKING CONTINUES ] [ SCREAMS ] NO! NO! NO! Narrator: HE RAPED HER, THEN STABBED HER, SLIT HER THROAT, AND LEFT HER FOR DEAD. PAGE ADMITS HE TRIED WASHING PEYTON'S BLOOD FROM THE STOLEN SWEATSHIRT. Nelson Goldwater: HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND GOT NAKED AND WASHED HIS CLOTHES IN MY WASHER/DRYER AND DRANK, NAKED, WATCHING CABLE ON OUR COUCH. Narrator: WHEN THE BLOOD WOULDN'T COME OUT, PAGE BAGGED UP THE SHIRT, THE KNIFE, AND THE BROKEN DOOR TRIM. HE TOOK THE BLUE COAT AND THREW CASH AND LOOSE CHANGE IN THE BLACK BAG. ON HIS WAY OUT, HE TOSSED THE EVIDENCE IN THE DUMPSTER, THEN WALKED TO THE BUS DEPOT AND HOPPED A RIDE TO BALTIMORE WITH PEYTON'S BLOOD STILL ON HIS PANTS AND SHOES. [ PROJECTOR WHIRRING ] HE TAKES HIS BUS TRIP TO MARYLAND AND THEN ROBS SOMEONE. IT'S PROOF THAT HE'S AN EVIL BEING WITH NO CARE FOR LIFE WHATSOEVER. Priest: DONTA WAS A TRUE PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY. DONTA CARED ABOUT DONTA -- NO ONE ELSE. Narrator: PROSECUTORS CHARGE HIM WITH BURGLARY, AGGRAVATED ROBBERY, SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. A JURY FINDS DONTA PAGE GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES. A THREE-JUDGE PANEL DETERMINES THE CRIME DOES NOT WARRANT THE DEATH PENALTY. THEY SENTENCE HIM TO LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE PLUS 224 YEARS. I WANTED TO LOOK EACH ONE OF THEM IN THE EYE AND SAY, "TELL ME, IF YOUR DAUGHTER IS STABBED 17 TIMES, "HER THROAT SLIT, SHE'S SEXUALLY ASSAULTED, "HER HANDS ARE CUT BECAUSE SHE'S FIGHTING FOR HER LIFE -- "AND THAT'S NOT HEINOUS ENOUGH? I NEED YOU TO DEFINE THAT FOR ME." IT STILL CAUSES ME GREAT ANGER TODAY, HOW THE COURT COULD SAY THAT. Nelson Goldwater: THAT WAS THE FIRST FACE OF EVIL THAT I REALLY EVER SAW, WAS HIM. AND... [ SIGHS ] YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS SAID THIS, AFTER SHE DIED -- "HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER NAME." HE ATTACKED HER, STABBED HER, RAPED HER, AND HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER NAME. HE DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS A PERSON. HE COULD CARE LESS. Narrator: PAT TUTHILL MOURNS HER DAUGHTER AND PAYS HER TRIBUTE THROUGH ACTIVISM. SHE NOW DEVOTES HER LIFE TO CHANGING PROBATION AND PAROLE PROCEDURE. HER COMMITMENT HELPED IMPROVE THE INTER-STATE COMPACT, TO BETTER TRACK AND MONITOR OFFENDERS WHEN TRANSFERRED STATE TO STATE. Ritter, Jr.: AS A RESULT, PAT TUTHILL VERY MUCH MAY HAVE SAVED OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES. Narrator: YET NOTHING FULLY TAKES AWAY THE PAIN OF LOSING A CHILD THIS WAY. HE'S BREATHING AND SHE'S NOT. WHERE -- WHERE IS THE FAIRNESS? WHERE IS THE JUSTICE? HOW DOES THIS BALANCE OUT? MY DAUGHTER SHOULD BE ALIVE. Nelson Goldwater: YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL SAY A PRAYER, SOMETIMES, IF YOU'RE GOING ON THE ROAD -- THINGS LIKE, "GOD, PLEASE WATCH OVER ME." INSTEAD, I JUST SAY, "PEYTON, WATCH OVER ME." SHE'S NOW MY ANGEL THAT I TALK TO AND THINK SHE'S UP THERE, TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF ME.
