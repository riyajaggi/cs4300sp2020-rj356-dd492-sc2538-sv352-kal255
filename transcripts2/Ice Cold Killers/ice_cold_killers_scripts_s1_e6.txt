 [ WOLF HOWLING ] Narrator: THE WILDS OF ALASKA ARE A VAST AND UNTAMED FRONTIER. Oberlatz: I DON'T THINK THERE'S MUCH THAT SEPARATES LIFE AND DEATH IN ALASKA. DEPENDING ON YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES, YOU CAN FIND YOURSELF RIGHT ON THE EDGE, AND THAT EDGE IS RAZOR-THIN. [ SNARLING ] Narrator: AMID THE RUGGED WILDERNESS, PEOPLE VANISH AT AN EERILY HIGH RATE.

[ GUNSHOTS ] NO ONE WAS SAFE. ABSOLUTELY NO ONE WAS SAFE ON THE STREETS THAT DAY.

 THE SLEEPY LITTLE SUBURB OF PALMER. Derry: PALMER WAS A WHISTLE-STOP. IN 1935, THEY BROUGHT IMMIGRANTS UP FROM MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN AND MINNESOTA. THEY WERE GIVEN LAND TRACTS BY LOTTERY, ESSENTIALLY JUST PULLING A NAME OUT OF A HAT. AND FROM THERE, IT GREW INTO THE TOWN IT IS TODAY. Narrator: A PIONEER'S PARADISE WHERE THE SOIL IS RICH AND THE SUN NEVER STOPS SHINING. IN 2007, 28-YEAR-OLD ERIN ROGERS IS BASKING IN THE GLOW OF A SECOND CHANCE IN PALMER. HIS FATHER, CHRIS, AND HIS FIANCéE, LENNIE, AGREE TO LET ERIN LIVE IN THE HOUSE BEHIND THEIRS AFTER HE'S CONVICTED ON A DRUNK-DRIVING CHARGE. HE WAS HELPING CHRIS AND LENNIE AROUND THE HOUSE. HE HELPED THEM PAINT. HE HELPED THEM DO A LOT OF THINGS AROUND THE HOUSE. HELPED WITH THE YARD WORK. AND SO I THOUGHT HE WAS DOING REAL WELL. Narrator: CHRIS AND LENNIE HAD KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR YEARS. THEY DRIFTED APART AFTER CHILDHOOD, ONLY TO RECONNECT AS ADULTS AT AN A.A. MEETING. LENNIE HAD BEEN SOBER FOR 13 YEARS. CHRIS HAD GONE SEEKING SUPPORT FOR HIS SON. Moren: CHRIS WAS MY HEART AND MY SOUL MATE. HE WAS JUST THE MOST ROMANTIC MAN I'D EVER KNOWN. I KNEW THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE TOGETHER FOREVER. Narrator: ON DECEMBER 1st, FOUR MONTHS AFTER TAKING ERIN IN, CHRIS AND LENNIE HOST AN IMPROMPTU CELEBRATION WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS TO MARK THEIR ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF DATING. WE WERE CELEBRATING EXACTLY 365 DAYS TOGETHER. 365 PERFECT DAYS. WE MADE ERIN'S FAVORITE MEAL, HOMEMADE PIZZA. HE AND I WENT SHOPPING TOGETHER FOR ALL THE INGREDIENTS, AND HE DID ALL THE CHOPPING AND PREPARATION. Narrator: THE EVENING IS FILLED WITH HAPPY TIMES AND TALK OF THE COUPLE'S FUTURE. Moren: WE WERE GONNA GET MARRIED ON JUNE 21st, ON THE SOLSTICE. WE WERE GONNA HAVE A WOODSTOCK WEDDING. Narrator: CAUGHT UP IN THE EXCITEMENT, ERIN VOLUNTEERS TO TAKE CARE OF THE FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS. Moren: I MEAN, I FELT LIKE CINDERELLA. I FELT LIKE A PRINCESS IN A DISNEY MOVIE. IT WAS THE HAPPIEST EVENING OF MY LIFE. Narrator: AFTER THE PARTY, ERIN RETIRES TO THE LIVING ROOM TO WATCH TV WHILE CHRIS AND LENNIE TURN IN FOR THE NIGHT ALONG WITH CHRIS' DOG, BEAR. Moren: BEAR WAS HALF ENGLISH MASTIFF, HALF WOLF. AND HE CAME WITH CHRIS. THEY WERE A PACKAGE DEAL. BEAR WEIGHED 150 POUNDS, AND HE WAS JUST A BIG PUPPY. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] Derry: HE LOVED CHRIS. HE WENT EVERYWHERE WITH CHRIS. CHRIS WOULD LET HIM RIDE IN THE TRUCK WITH HIM, AND HE'D JUST WOULD SIT THERE IN THE PASSENGER'S SEAT. BUT WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE TRUCK FROM BEHIND, IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS A BLOND WOMAN SITTING NEXT TO CHRIS. AND SO, I ALWAYS GOT A CHUCKLE OUT OF THAT. Narrator: HOURS LATER, AS DAWN BEGINS TO BREAK AND THE MATANUSKA WINDS HOWL OUTSIDE, LENNIE IS LYING IN BED AWAKE. Moren: I HEARD ERIN GOING IN AND OUT OF THE HOUSE. YOU KNOW, HE WAS WATCHING TV IN THE LIVING ROOM, GOING OUT AND HAVING A CIGARETTE, COMING BACK IN. YOU KNOW, I LOOKED AT THE CLOCK, AND IT WAS 4:20. AND I WAS ALMOST GONNA GET UP AND SAY, YOU KNOW, "PLEASE, GO TO BED." Narrator: BUT BEFORE SHE HAS TIME TO UTTER A WORD, SHE IS SHAKEN TO THE CORE BY THE UNIMAGINABLE. Moren: ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS PERSON COMES IN WITH WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A STICK. [ SCREAMS ] AND HE IS YELLING, "LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE MAKING ME DO," AND STARTS HITTING CHRIS ON THE NECK. AND I JUMP ACROSS THE BED, TRY TO GRAB THE STICK AND BRING MY HAND BACK, AND THAT'S WHEN I LOST THE TIPS OF MY FINGERS. AND I'M LOOKING AT MY FINGERS, THINKING, "I'M BEING HIT BY A MACHETE." AT THE SAME TIME, I'M WONDERING IF ERIN HAD BEEN HURT, 'CAUSE I KNEW HE HAD BEEN IN THE LIVING ROOM WATCHING TELEVISION. Narrator: IN AN INSTANT, LENNIE MOREN IS IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING SHE CANNOT EVEN BEGIN TO COMPREHEND. Moren: THEN I REALIZED IT WAS HIM, THAT IT'S ERIN. AND I AM TRYING TO WAKE CHRIS UP, WHO I DON'T KNOW IF HIS HEAD IS EVEN STILL ON HIM. THEN SUDDENLY I HEAR THIS SOUND COME OUT OF HIM AND HE PICKS ERIN UP AS HE RISES UP AND IS ABLE TO CARRY HIM INTO THE KITCHEN. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] I WAS PRAYING THE WHOLE TIME. I WAS SAYING THE LORD'S PRAYER OVER AND OVER AGAIN PERFECTLY, HOPING THAT HE WOULD SNAP OUT OF IT BY HEARING MY PRAYERS. Narrator: LENNIE IS DESPERATE FOR COVER. SHE SCRAMBLES TO PROTECT HERSELF AS BLOOD POURS FROM THE MASSIVE WOUNDS OF A 22-INCH BLADE. Moren: AT THIS POINT, I HAD BEEN HIT SEVERAL TIMES. MY ELBOW IS GONE, AND MY LEG IS CUT VERY, VERY BADLY. I'M NOT ABLE TO STAND ON MY LEG. I'M ABLE TO HOP. I AM ABLE TO GET INTO THE BATHROOM, BUT I'M NOT ABLE TO LOCK THE DOOR BECAUSE, OF COURSE, THE FINGERS ARE CUT OFF. Narrator: SECONDS LATER, ERIN BARGES THROUGH THE BATHROOM DOOR AND OVERPOWERS HER. [ SCREAMS ] HE SLASHES HER REPEATEDLY, BRINGING THE MACHETE DOWN AGAIN AND AGAIN. Moren: I WASN'T REALLY THINKING ABOUT WHAT HE WAS DOING. I WAS MORE IN THE PRESENT MOMENT. I HAD NO FEAR, AND I HAD NO PAIN. IT WAS MORE LIKE I WAS JUST WAITING TO GO TO THE NEXT CHAPTER. I NEVER EXPECTED TO LIVE. AT ONE POINT, I LOOK HIM IN THE EYE AND I SAY, "WE'RE DEAD. YOU'VE KILLED US. YOU CAN STOP NOW." AND HE DOES. AND I THINK, "WELL, GEE, I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT SOONER." [ BEAR GROWLING ] BUT THEN I REALIZED BEAR IS PULLING HIM OFF OF ME. [ SCREAMING ] Derry: BEAR MUST HAVE WENT BALLISTIC. HE KNEW WHAT VIOLENCE WAS. HE COULDN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PLAY AND REAL. TO HIM, IT WAS ALL REAL. [ BEAR BARKING AND GROWLING ] I'M CERTAIN THAT WHEN HE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING, HE ABSOLUTELY INTERVENED. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] Narrator: BEAR VICIOUSLY CHASES ERIN OUT OF THE HOUSE. HE TAKES COVER IN HIS FATHER'S TRUCK AND FLEES THE SCENE. BACK IN THE BATHROOM, LENNIE IS TERRIFIED ERIN WILL RETURN. SHE USES HER TEETH TO LOCK THE DOOR AND HER ENGAGEMENT RING TO CALL FOR HELP. [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] Narrator: CHRIS ROGERS AND HIS FIANCéE, LENNIE MOREN, HAVE IT ALL. BUT THEIR FAIRY-TALE ROMANCE BECOMES A NIGHTMARE WHEN THEY ARE ATTACKED WITH A MACHETE AT THE HANDS OF CHRIS' OWN SON, ERIN. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Man: STATE POLICE! Narrator: WITHIN MINUTES, ALASKA STATE TROOPERS AND THE LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARRIVE AT THE GRISLY SCENE. THEY FIND BLOOD EVERYWHERE, IN SPLATTERS, IN DRIPS, IN POOLS. THE WALLS ARE PAINTED RED. Kalytiak: IT'S HARD TO FIND THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE IT. IT'S ALMOST LIKE IN A HOUSE OF HORRORS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BECAUSE, I MEAN, THERE WAS A LOT OF BLOOD. Narrator: TROOPERS KICK IN THE BATHROOM DOOR AND FIND LENNIE CLINGING TO LIFE. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? Moren: THEY SAID, "OH, MY GOD, IS SHE IN ONE PIECE? HOW ARE WE GONNA GET HER OUT OF HERE?" AND ANOTHER ONE SAID, "WE'RE JUST GONNA WRAP UP AND ROLL." Narrator: WHILE EMTs TEND TO LENNIE'S WOUNDS, SHE TELLS OFFICERS HER FUTURE SON-IN-LAW IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ATTACK. AND THAT'S NOT ALL. IF HE TOOK OFF IN HIS FATHER'S TRUCK, HE'S NOW ARMED WITH MORE THAN A MACHETE. THE NIGHT BEFORE, CHRIS PUT HIS.357 MAGNUM REVOLVER UNDER THE SEAT. WHITE MALE DRIVING A DODGE PICKUP TRUCK... Moren: WE HAD A PARTY. WE DIDN'T FEEL SECURE PUTTING IT ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE, SO CHRIS PUT IT OUT IN THE TRUCK. Narrator: LENNIE HAS NO IDEA HER FIANCé IS DEAD. ALASKA STATE TROOPERS SCOUR THE PROPERTY BUT CAN'T FIND THE ASSAILANT OR HIS WEAPON. THERE IS ALSO NO SIGN OF BEAR. WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT BEAR BECAUSE HE WAS MISSING. THERE WERE BLOODSTAINS, DOG PAW PRINTS LEADING AWAY, SO WE KNEW HE WAS INJURED. Narrator: A HANDFUL OF NEIGHBORS TEAM UP WITH ARMED TROOPERS TO FIND THE INJURED ANIMAL. FEARING ROGERS' NEXT MOVE, POLICE CONTACT NEIGHBORING DEPARTMENTS AND WARN THEM TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A DANGEROUS SUSPECT ARMED WITH TWO DEADLY WEAPONS, A BLADE NEARLY 2 FEET LONG AND A.357 MAGNUM REVOLVER. THERE WAS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UNPREDICTABILITY TO THE SITUATION. AND NOBODY HAD AN IDEA WHERE HE WAS AT THAT POINT. Oberlatz: ALASKA IS A GREAT PLACE TO DISAPPEAR. AND IF YOU WANT TO ESCAPE AND YOU NEED TO HIDE, THERE ARE VERY FEW PLACES LEFT IN THE WORLD WHERE YOU CAN DO IT. AND ALASKA IS ONE OF THOSE PLACES. MacDonald: THE WORD FIRST CAME OUT LATER ON IN THE MORNING ON SUNDAY WAS THAT THIS WAS SORT OF A DOMESTIC CRIME THAT TOOK PLACE AND NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND THE ASSAILANT AND THE ASSAILANT'S ON THE RUN. WE HAD NO IDEA WHAT LIE IN THE FUTURE. Narrator: POLICE ISSUE AN ALL POINTS BULLETIN FOR THE TRUCK ERIN ROGERS IS DRIVING. FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE ON HEIGHTENED ALERT. Derry: NO ONE KNEW WHERE HE WAS. AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WOULD SHOW UP, WHAT HE WAS LIKE, WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO. SO, EVERYBODY ARMED THEMSELVES, AND WE WERE READY. Narrator: FORTUNATELY, TROOPERS FIND BEAR ALIVE BUT BADLY INJURED. HE'S BLEEDING PROFUSELY FROM A MISSING CANINE TOOTH AND A 6-INCH GASH FROM THE MACHETE. Derry: HE JUST SEEMED BUMMED. I THINK HE MISSED CHRIS, MISSED LENNIE. I DON'T THINK HE REALLY COMPREHENDED IN THE END WHAT HAD HAPPENED. Narrator: MEANWHILE, A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK ON THE SUSPECT SUGGESTS THE MACHETE-WIELDING MADMAN IS A HABITUAL OFFENDER WHO KNOWS HOW TO BEAT THE SYSTEM. MacDonald: ERIN ROGERS JR. HAD A TUMULTUOUS PAST. HE HAD BEEN IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW ON MANY OCCASIONS. Narrator: AS A TEENAGER, ROGERS WAS TWICE CAUGHT STEALING. HIS FAMILY SOUGHT HELP, ENROLLING ERIN IN THE ALASKA NATIONAL GUARD YOUTH CORPS CHALLENGE, A PROGRAM DESIGNED TO HELP PROBLEM KIDS TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND. BUT IT HAD LITTLE EFFECT. Derry: AS MUCH AS CHRIS TRIED, HE JUST COULDN'T REACH HIM. HE COULDN'T MAKE HIM UNDERSTAND THE ROAD THAT HE WAS HEADED DOWN WAS GONNA LEAD TO DESTRUCTION. Narrator: AT AGE 19, ROGERS PUT THE LIVES OF THOSE LIVING IN THE HEAVILY POPULATED AREA OF EAGLE RIVER AT RISK BY SETTING TWO FOREST FIRES ON THE SAME DAY. HE WAS SENTENCED TO PROBATION AFTER HIS FAMILY INTERVENED AND ASKED THE JUDGE FOR LENIENCY. A DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE CONVICTION FOLLOWED, THEN A DRUNK-DRIVING CHARGE. [ SIREN WAILING ] HE GOT ANOTHER SLAP ON THE WRIST. ALL OF THESE THINGS GOT HIM PROBATION, 2 YEARS' PROBATION HERE, 5 YEARS' PROBATION THERE, BUT NO REAL JAIL TIME TO SPEAK OF. Moren: OH, HE WAS THE SECOND-CHANCE KID. ERIN WAS VERY GOOD AT, "I'M SORRY, I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN." HE WAS VERY, VERY GOOD AT THAT. Narrator: IN JULY 2007, HE WAS ARRESTED A SECOND TIME FOR DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED. HIS FATHER AGAIN CAME TO HIS RESCUE. Moren: WE KIND OF FELT THAT MAYBE THIRD-PARTYING HIM, HAVING HIM IN OUR HOME, SEEING WHAT A SOBER LIFE WAS LIKE WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR HIM, AND WE WANTED TO EXTEND HIM THAT OPPORTUNITY. MacDonald: HE NEEDED GUIDANCE. HE NEEDED LOVE. HE NEEDED UNDERSTANDING. HE NEEDED STABILITY. AND THAT'S WHAT MR. ROGERS AND LENNIE WERE TRYING TO DO, TRYING TO GIVE HIM. Narrator: FIVE MONTHS LATER, CHRIS ROGERS LAY ON AN AUTOPSY TABLE. THE MEDICAL EXAMINER COUNTS 25 MACHETE WOUNDS, INCLUDING 13 TO THE HEAD AND NECK. THERE ISN'T ENOUGH BLOOD LEFT IN HIS BODY TO PERFORM A STANDARD TOXICOLOGY TEST. Kalytiak: THE WOUNDS WERE WIDE AND DEEP, YOU KNOW, THE KIND OF WOUNDS THAT OPEN UP MUSCLE, LAYERS OF MUSCLE, AND WHERE YOU CAN LOOK INTO THE BODY. THOSE KIND OF WOUNDS. DEFINITELY HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST BRUTAL ATTACKS IN THE HISTORY OF ALASKA. [ SIREN WAILING ] Narrator: LENNIE IS STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE THE SAME KIND OF GAPING WOUNDS. Moren: BOTH ARMS, ONE LEG. FROM MY HEAD TO MY TOES, HE HIT ME THREE TIMES IN THE HEAD RIGHT THROUGH HERE. AND THEN THEY QUIT COUNTING AT 50. Narrator: MEANWHILE, POLICE IN PALMER KNOW ERIN ROGERS IS A STEP AHEAD OF THEM. [ SIREN WAILING ] BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA THAT HE'S MADE HIS WAY TO ANCHORAGE... ...OR THAT HE'S DITCHED THE TRUCK HE STOLE FROM HIS FATHER, ALONG WITH THE MACHETE, AND IS NOW ON THE PROWL FOR A NEW SET OF WHEELS. Bachman: HE WAS LOOKING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY, SO HE JIGGLED DOORS. HIS IDEA WAS, "IF I CAN GET A CAR, I CAN GET OUT OF TOWN AND CONTINUE MY FLIGHT." Narrator: BUT THERE'S SOMEONE STANDING IN HIS WAY -- 27-YEAR-OLD JASON WENGER, A GRADUATE STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALASKA. Staub: HE WANTED TO BE ON HIS OWN, AND I THINK HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD VERY MUCH TO BEING ON HIS OWN SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO RELY UPON HIS PARENTS AS A 20-SOMETHING-YEAR-OLD. AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHAT MOTIVATED HIM... EVEN THOUGH HE WAS SOMEWHAT APPREHENSIVE ABOUT GOING SO FAR AWAY TO SUCH A WILD PLACE AS ALASKA. Narrator: THAT MORNING, JASON IS SITTING IN HIS CAR. HE'S WAITING FOR IT TO WARM UP BEFORE HEADING TO CHURCH. HE WENT OUT TO START IT UP BECAUSE IT WAS FRIGID AND IT NEEDED TIME FOR THE ENGINE TO WARM UP. HE WAS LISTENING TO MUSIC, PROBABLY OBLIVIOUS TO ANYTHING THAT WAS GOING ON AROUND HIM. Narrator: OUT OF NOWHERE, ERIN ROGERS WALKS UP TO THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW... [ GUNSHOT ] ...AND OPENS FIRE. TWO SHOTS ECHO THROUGH THE STILL MORNING AIR. THE NOISE OF THE GUNSHOT STARTLED ROGERS TO THE POINT WHERE HE THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA WAKE UP THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD. Narrator: HE'S FURTHER ALARMED WHEN THE WEIGHT OF JASON'S BODY COLLAPSES AGAINST THE ACCELERATOR, REVVING THE ENGINE. ROGERS TAKES OFF ON FOOT. A SHORT TIME LATER, A NEIGHBOR WALKING HIS DOG FINDS JASON SLUMPED OVER THE WHEEL AND CALLS POLICE. WHEN MEDICS ARRIVE, JASON WENGER IS PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE SCENE. Staub: THAT EVENING, WE GOT A KNOCK AT OUR FRONT DOOR. AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY DEBBIE KNEW WHAT WAS COMING, AND SHE STARTED TO CRY. I THOUGHT, "OH, NO. THIS CAN'T BE TRUE. THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING." Narrator: INTERVIEWS WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND NEIGHBORS OFFER NO CLUES AS TO WHO MAY HAVE WANTED A MAN LIKE JASON WENGER DEAD. WENGER HAD DEDICATED A LARGE PART OF HIS TIME TO WORKING WITH THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. Staub: HE HAD A FONDNESS FOR THE UNDERDOG, THE PERSON THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LACKING IN SOME WAY, NOT BY ANY FAULT OF THEIR OWN. JUST KIND OF DISBELIEVING, WHO WOULD WANT TO SHOOT HIM? YOU KNOW, WHY? WHAT POSSIBLE MOTIVE? I MEAN, EVEN IF THEY WANTED TO STEAL THE TRUCK, HE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GIVEN THEM THE KEYS OR EVEN DRIVEN HIM WHERE HE WANTED TO GO. MacDonald: IT WAS ALL VERY RANDOM. THAT'S WHAT WAS SCARING A LOT OF FOLKS, TOO. IT JUST SEEMED VERY RANDOM. Narrator: EXHAUSTED, ROGERS DUCKS INTO THE WILD TO REST. WHEN HE WAKES FROM A NAP, HE BUYS A PACK OF CIGARETTES AND A BOTTLE OF BEER AT A NEARBY CONVENIENCE STORE. BUT HIS PLAN HAS CHANGED. HE'S NO LONGER HUNTING FOR A WAY OUT OF TOWN. MacDonald: HE WAS HUNTING FOR PEOPLE. HE WAS GOING TO TAKE AS MANY PEOPLE OUT AS POSSIBLE. HE WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT GETTING CAUGHT. HE WAS GONNA TAKE MORE PEOPLE OUT WITH HIM. [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] Narrator: A DANGEROUS DOUBLE MURDERER IS ON THE LOOSE IN ANCHORAGE, ALASKA. AND 33-YEAR-OLD ELIZABETH RUMSEY, A LAW CLERK FOR THE ALASKA SUPREME COURT, HAS NO WAY TO KNOW SHE'S ABOUT TO MEET HIM FACE TO FACE. SHE'S WALKING HOME ALONE AFTER VOLUNTEERING AT A LOCAL THEATER. Rumsey: I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET A FRIEND FOR DINNER, AND I HAD NOT BROUGHT MY CAR WITH ME. THIS IS LITERALLY WHAT WENT THROUGH MY MIND. "IT MIGHT NOT BE SAFE FOR ME TO WALK HOME LATE AT NIGHT "AFTER I'D HAD DINNER. WHY DON'T I GO GET MY CAR NOW?" Narrator: LIZ IS CHATTING ON HER CELLPHONE WHEN SHE'S SUDDENLY SURPRISED BY THE TALL, SKINNY STRANGER. Rumsey: I HADN'T HEARD HIM OR SEEN HIM. HE JUST APPEARED, SO IT REALLY DID SORT OF STARTLE ME A LITTLE BIT. HE JUST SAID, YOU KNOW, "DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?" AND IT JUST STRUCK ME AS LIKE, "WOW. THAT WAS OUT OF NOWHERE." Narrator: LIZ KEEPS WALKING. MINUTES LATER, SHE STEPS OFF THE BIKE PATH ONLY A BLOCK FROM HOME. Rumsey: I DIDN'T HAVE THAT CREEPY FEELING YOU HAVE WHEN YOU'RE BEING FOLLOWED. I JUST GOT BACK INTO MY CONVERSATION AND DIDN'T EVEN MENTION THE INTERACTION TO MY FRIEND AND JUST CARRIED ON. HE THOUGHT THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE RECOGNIZED HIM AND THAT SHE WAS GONNA CALL THE POLICE. Narrator: SUDDENLY, ROGERS UNLOADS HIS WEAPON, SHOOTING LIZ THREE TIMES. Rumsey: THEY ALL HIT ME AS I WAS FALLING. IT WAS ALL AT ONCE. THE PHONE FELL OUT OF MY HAND, AND I COULD SEE IT LIKE 5, 6 FEET AWAY AND I REMEMBER YELLING TO MY FRIEND, "I'VE BEEN SHOT. I'VE BEEN SHOT." Narrator: THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE DRAWS RESIDENTS FROM THEIR HOMES, AND THEY CALL FOR HELP. AS DARKNESS FALLS, MEDICS ARRIVE AND POLICE SEARCH THE SCENE FOR CLUES. ALL THE WHILE, THE SADISTIC GUNMAN WATCHES FROM THE WOODS. THIS IS A PRETTY CRUEL AND HEARTLESS AND CALLOUS INDIVIDUAL, SOMEBODY WHO'S DEMONSTRATING A DEVIL-MAY-CARE SORT OF ATTITUDE ABOUT WHAT HE'S DOING, 'CAUSE HE'S ENJOYING WATCHING THE POLICE RESPONSE. [ SIRENS WAILING ] Narrator: LIZ IS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL IN CRITICAL CONDITION. SHE IS UNABLE TO DESCRIBE HER ATTACKER TO POLICE. I DIDN'T MAKE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PERSON WHO ASKED ME FOR THE TIME AND WHO COULD IT HAVE BEEN THAT HAD JUST SHOT ME. THE POLICE ARE SAYING, "WHO DID THIS" WHO DID THIS?" AND I'M LIKE, "I HAVE NO IDEA." Narrator: WHILE ALASKA STATE TROOPERS SEARCH FOR THE MAN BEHIND A GRUESOME MACHETE ATTACK, ANCHORAGE POLICE ARE NOW SCRAMBLING TO FIND A GUN-TOTING KILLER OF THEIR OWN. [ SIREN WAILING ] THE CITY OF ANCHORAGE IS HELD HOSTAGE. NEITHER DEPARTMENT REALIZES THEY'RE HUNTING THE SAME SUSPECT. Oberlatz: EVERYBODY WAS TERRIFIED. PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED THAT THIS GUY WAS GONNA POP OUT ANYWHERE AND KILL THEM. Narrator: THE FOLLOWING MORNING IN ANCHORAGE, AN ARCHITECT AND MARRIED FATHER OF TWO GLANCES AT THE NEWSPAPER ON HIS WAY OUT THE DOOR. ERIN ROGERS' PICTURE IS PLASTERED ON THE FRONT PAGE. HE'S NOW A WANTED MAN, CHARGED WITH MURDERING HIS FATHER WITH A MACHETE AND SLASHING UP HIS FIANCéE. [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] THE MAN GETS IN HIS CAR AND STARTS THE ENGINE TO WARM THE VEHICLE FOR THE DRIVE TO WORK. MacDonald: WHILE HE'S DOING THAT, ERIN ROGERS IS WATCHING. AND THIS TIME, HE DOESN'T MAKE THE MISTAKE THAT HE MADE WITH WENGER. Bachman: ROGERS WAITED FOR HIM TO GET OUT OF HIS CAR, AND ROGERS AMBUSHED HIM. Narrator: IN A FLASH, THE ARCHITECT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OWN WORST NIGHTMARE. ROGERS PULLS HIM OUT OF THE JEEP. AAH! AS THE MAN STRUGGLES WITH HIS ATTACKER, ROGERS FIRES FIVE SHOTS AT POINT-BLANK RANGE. HE WAS BASICALLY ON A RAMPAGE. HE WAS GONNA TAKE THIS OUT ON ANYBODY WHO CROSSED HIS PATH. [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] Narrator: ERIN ROGERS IS ON A KILLING SPREE. [ SCREAMING ] THE MAN WHO HACKED HIS OWN FATHER TO DEATH WITH A MACHETE IS ON THE RUN. HE'S DESPERATE TO FIND A GETAWAY CAR AND ISN'T ABOUT TO LET ANYBODY STAND IN HIS WAY. [ GUNSHOTS ] HE DISAPPEARS INTO THE OUTBACK AFTER SHOOTING LIZ RUMSEY IN THE BACK... ...ONLY TO SURFACE AGAIN IN THE DRIVEWAY OF AN ANCHORAGE MAN WHO IS GETTING READY TO LEAVE FOR WORK. WHO ARE YOU?! SURPRISED BY ROGERS' BRUTAL ATTACK, THE MAN FEARS HE IS INCHES AWAY FROM CERTAIN DEATH. [ GUNSHOT ] Bachman: ROGERS POINTED THE GUN AT HIS HEAD, AND HE TURNED HIS HEAD AT THE VERY LAST MOMENT SO THAT HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE NECK BUT NOT SQUARELY IN THE FACE. HE WAS AFRAID THAT ROGERS MIGHT ACTUALLY RUN HIM OVER, THAT THE ASSAULT WASN'T OVER WITH. Narrator: INSTEAD, ROGERS RACES FROM THE SCENE. THE MAN SOMEHOW MANAGES TO CRAWL TO HIS FRONT DOOR. [ COUGHING ] SUFFERING FROM A PUNCTURED LUNG, HE CAN'T YELL LOUDLY ENOUGH TO WAKE HIS WIFE, WHO HAS DISMISSED THE SOUND OF GUNFIRE AS FIREWORKS. HAVING BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE ARM, HAVING BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE TORSO, HAVING BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE NECK, HE HAS TO TRY AND MANIPULATE A CELLPHONE WITH BLOODY HANDS. HE ENDS UP USING HIS TEETH TO ACTUALLY GET THE PHONE OPEN BECAUSE HIS HANDS ARE TOO SLIPPERY TO GET THE PHONE OPEN. Narrator: HE MUSTERS THE STRENGTH TO DIAL 911. [ SIREN WAILING ] [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] Narrator: SECONDS LATER, POLICE AND PARAMEDICS ARE AT HIS SIDE. JUST HANG IN THERE, OKAY? HE IS ABLE TO DESCRIBE THE GETAWAY CAR AND THE GUNMAN. Bachman: HE WAS AMAZINGLY DETAILED IN HIS ACCOUNT. THE MAN IS AN ARCHITECT. THE MAN IS A PERSON WHO IS ACCUSTOMED TO BEING PRECISE AND DETAILED. POLICE, I THINK, AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT HAVE THEIR "AHA" MOMENT AND REALIZE THAT ALL THIS HAS TO BE CONNECTED, THAT THIS HAS TO BE THEIR GUY FROM PALMER. Narrator: IMMEDIATELY, ANCHORAGE POLICE JOIN IN THE HUNT TO STOP ERIN ROGERS BEFORE HARM COMES TO ANOTHER INNOCENT PERSON. [ SIREN WAILING ] MacDonald: IT WAS JUST COMPLETE RANDOMNESS. AND AGAIN, WHOEVER WAS GONNA CROSS HIS PATH WAS IN TROUBLE THAT DAY, AND NO ONE WAS SAFE. ABSOLUTELY NO ONE WAS SAFE ON THE STREETS THAT DAY. Narrator: NOT EVEN THE POLICE. OFFICERS ARE DEEPLY DISTURBED BY WHAT THEY MIGHT ENCOUNTER WHEN THEY FIND ROGERS... ...AND KNOW THEY MUST BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING GIVEN THE COLD, CALCULATED PREMEDITATION OF THE MACHETE ATTACK. Kalytiak: WHEN PEOPLE SLEEP, THEY'RE REALLY DEFENSELESS. YOU KNOW, HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT SITUATION. HE HAD TO THINK ABOUT IT. HE WAS THERE THE EVENING BEFORE. HE WENT BACK TO HIS PLACE ON THE PROPERTY, WHERE HE HAD THE MACHETE. THERE HAD TO BE SOME THOUGHT PROCESS THAT WENT INTO IT YOU KNOW, THAT HE WAS GONNA DO THIS AND HOW HE WAS GONNA DO IT. Narrator: THOSE CLOSEST TO THE SUSPECT SHARE ALL THEY CAN WITH POLICE IN HOPE OF GIVING AUTHORITIES THE UPPER HAND. BUT EVEN THOSE WHO KNOW ROGERS BEST ARE AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT COULD HAVE SET HIM OFF. Derry: I DON'T BELIEVE HE JUST SNAPPED. THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING INSIDE PEOPLE THAT DO THIS, A CONSCIENCE, AND AN INHERENT EVIL RESIDES IN ITS PLACE. MY HEART'S POUNDING OUT OF MY CHEST JUST THINKING ABOUT IT. Narrator: MINUTES AFTER THE ASSAULT, ANCHORAGE POLICE CLOSE IN ON ROGERS. THEY SPOT THE STOLEN JEEP AND QUICKLY FOLLOW IN BEHIND IT. ROGERS TRIES TO OUTMANEUVER POLICE, GUNNING THE VEHICLE DOWN A NARROW ROAD. MacDonald: IT'S VERY OBVIOUS TO THE POLICE THAT THIS FELLA IS NOT GONNA GIVE UP. AND TWO POLICE OFFICERS DECIDE TO RAM THEIR CAR INTO HIS TO DISABLE IT. Narrator: COPS FORCE HIS VEHICLE INTO A DITCH. FROM BEHIND THE WHEEL, ROGERS GRABS HIS GUN AND TAKES AIM AT OFFICERS. POLICE PREPARE FOR AN ALL-OUT BLOODBATH. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] HE WAS IN THAT MIND-SET OF JUST HE WAS GONNA GO OUT IN THIS BLAZE OF GLORY. [ WIND HOWLING ] [ WIND HOWLING ] [ SIREN WAILING ] Narrator: ANCHORAGE POLICE HAVE CORNERED THE MAN BEHIND A HEINOUS MACHETE ATTACK AND STRING OF RANDOM SHOOTINGS. AND IT QUICKLY BECOMES CLEAR THAT ERIN ROGERS ISN'T GOING TO GIVE UP EASILY. HE TAKES AIM AT OFFICERS AND ATTEMPTS TO FIRE. BUT HIS.357 MAGNUM REVOLVER JAMS. GET DOWN! HE'S QUICKLY SUBDUED AND TAKEN INTO CUSTODY. AFTER HIS ARREST, POLICE CONFISCATE THE GUN. INSIDE, THEY FIND FIVE LIVE ROUNDS AND PLENTY MORE IN ROGERS' JACKET. GET UP. ERIN ROGERS IS CHARGED WITH TWO COUNTS OF MURDER, THREE COUNTS OF ATTEMPTED MURDER, AND INJURY TO AN OFFICER WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE WRECK THAT LED TO HIS CAPTURE. THE TRUCK HE'D STOLEN FROM HIS FATHER IS FOUND AT A NEARBY GAS STATION WITH THE BLOODY MACHETE STILL INSIDE. Moren: HE BOUGHT IT AT A GARAGE SALE, AND I REMEMBER CLEARLY CHRIS TELLING HIM THAT THAT WAS GONNA BE HIS BEST FRIEND AT A CAMPSITE. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS HAVE BOTH MURDER WEAPONS IN HAND BUT NOT A SINGLE EXPLANATION FOR THE DEADLY MACHETE ATTACK ON ROGERS' FATHER AND FIANCéE OR THE SHOOTINGS OF THREE INNOCENT BYSTANDERS. DURING QUESTIONING, ROGERS OFFERS FEW CLUES ABOUT HIS ACTIONS... WHY DID YOU ATTACK YOUR FATHER? ...SAYING HE ATTACKED HIS FATHER AND FIANCéE BECAUSE HE WAS ANGRY OVER HOW HIS FAMILY TREATED HIM. Derry: I'M NOT SURE ANYONE REALLY KNEW WHAT WAS UNDERNEATH AND REALLY HOW TO HELP HIM. I THINK IT WAS ONLY A GUESS THAT PEOPLE MADE. BUT I THINK A LOT OF IT CAME FROM HIS HOME. Narrator: PERHAPS MORE SHOCKING, ROGERS CONFESSES THE STRING OF SHOOTINGS... [ GUNSHOTS ] ...STEMMED SOLELY FROM HIS DESIRE TO KILL A FEW MORE PEOPLE. Kalytiak: I THINK AT THAT POINT HE JUST FIGURED THAT HIS LIFE WAS PRETTY MUCH OVER. WHATEVER ELSE HE DID WOULDN'T BE OF ANY CONSEQUENCE. Narrator: ALTHOUGH ROGERS IS TRIED SEPARATELY FOR HIS CRIMES, PROSECUTORS DESCRIBE THE MAN BEHIND SUCH VICIOUS ATTACKS THE SAME WAY -- MANIPULATIVE, MERCILESS, AND SELF-CENTERED. BUT THEY CONTEND HE'S FAR FROM CRAZY AND HAS NEVER SHOWN ANY REMORSE, NOT EVEN FOR THE MURDER OF HIS OWN FATHER. Kalytiak: HE MENTIONED THAT IT TOOK SOME FORCE TO COMMIT THESE CRIMES AND I THINK HE MENTIONED HE HAD SOME REGRET. IF ANYTHING HE HAD SOME REGRET THAT HE DIDN'T USE A MORE EFFICIENT WEAPON, THAT BEING THE GUN THAT HE FOUND IN THE TRUCK. Narrator: IN A SURPRISE MOVE, PROSECUTORS CALL TO THE STAND BEAR, THE 150-POUND WOLF MASTIFF WHO CAME TO LENNIE'S RESCUE. I'M SURE IT HAD AN IMPACT. IT'S LIKE, "WOW." I'M SURE EVERYBODY IN THE COURTROOM WAS AMAZED AT HIS SIZE. I CREDIT BEAR FOR SAVING HER LIFE. Narrator: ROGERS IS FOUND GUILTY IN BOTH TRIALS. JASON WENGER'S FAMILY STILL STRUGGLES WITH THEIR LOSS BUT HAVE MANAGED TO FIND COMFORT IN THE FAITH THEY SHARED WITH THEIR ONLY SON. Staub: ERIN ROGERS IS THE KIND OF PERSON THAT JASON WOULD SEE AS SOMEONE WHO'S KIND OF THE UNDERDOG. YOU KNOW, EVERYONE'S AGAINST THEM KIND OF THING. AND IT SEEMS APPARENT THAT THAT'S HOW ERIN ROGERS VIEWED HIMSELF. YOU KNOW, EVERYONE WAS AGAINST HIM. YOU KNOW, NO ONE TOOK HIS SIDE. I THINK JASON WOULD HAVE WORKED TO TRY TO GET HIM TO SEE THAT HIS THINKING WAS ALL WRONG. Narrator: MEANWHILE, LENNIE AND THE OTHER SURVIVORS REFUSE TO LET ROGERS' DEMONS DEFINE THEM. SHE HAS FOUND STRENGTH IN HER OWN CONVICTIONS AND A WAY TO GO ON WITHOUT CHRIS. Moren: OUR RELATIONSHIP STARTED WITH THE LORD'S PRAYER 365 DAYS BEFORE, AND IT ENDED WITH THE LORD'S PRAYER. I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE LAST THING HE HEARD. Narrator: LENNIE HAS UNDERGONE 17 SURGERIES SINCE THE MACHETE ATTACK. SHE STILL STRUGGLES WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS BUT HOPES HER STORY WILL ENCOURAGE OTHERS. SHE IS PLANNING TO WRITE A BOOK ABOUT THE POWER OF A SURVIVOR. Moren: THIS IS REALLY STRANGE, AND PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN I SAY IT. BUT THE ATTACK WAS THE EASIEST PART OF THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE. AND IT WAS SPIRITUAL. I MEAN, I WAS IN THE ARMS OF GOD. I FELT A PEACE ABOUT IT. WHEN I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL, I FELT CRADLED. WHEN I WAS IN THAT ROOM ALONE, I FELT COMFORTED. I FELT LIFTED UP WHEN I WENT TO GET THE CELLPHONE. THERE IS NO WAY THAT I COULD HAVE GOTTEN UP FROM THE FLOOR BECAUSE I COULDN'T DO IT FOR A YEAR AFTERWARDS. Narrator: SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK, BEAR WAS NAMED MOST COURAGEOUS DOG IN ALASKA BY THE HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES. Derry: HE WAS A MAJESTIC GENTLE GIANT AND VERY REGAL AND FEARLESS, COURAGEOUS. HE DESERVED THAT, ABSOLUTELY. Narrator: SADLY, HE SUCCUMBED TO CANCER A YEAR AND A HALF LATER. LENNIE WAS WITH HIM WHEN HE DIED. Moren: HIS HEAD WAS IN MY LAP. HIS EAR WAS RIGHT NEXT TO MY HEART AND SO HE COULD HEAR MY HEART BEATING. AND HE ONLY KNEW LOVE. HE JUST LOOKED AT ME AND SLOWLY CLOSED HIS EYES. [ Voice breaking ] THE HARDEST THING I EVER DID WAS PUT DOWN THAT DOG BECAUSE THAT DOG SAVED MY LIFE.

BEFORE SENTENCING, LENNIE MOREN EXPRESSED TO THE COURT ALL THAT BEAR COULD NOT. Moren: CHRISTOPHER ERIN ROGERS JR. BUTCHERED MY HEART, FILLETING IT AS SURELY AS HE SLAUGHTERED HIS FATHER. SHOW HIM THE SAME MERCY HE SHOWED US. Narrator: ROGERS WAS SENTENCED TO 498 YEARS. HE IS GUARANTEED TO SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE BEHIND BARS.
