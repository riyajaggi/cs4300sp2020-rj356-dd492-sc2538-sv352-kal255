 What? I did what you said, but it didn't puff up. Did you add baking powder? That's it. And you know what? Pancake mix is sold in the market. Help me. Why are you guys still here? Because of Junpyo. Head back to class. Come on. You have goose bumps. So I forgot the baking powder. I'll try it again.

 Jihu. Thank you for helping me out. I didn't help you. I just didn't like what they were doing. What? Jihu? Yes, he appeared out of the blue. Who told you to do this? You wanted us to teach Jandi a lesson. I told you to scare her and make her surrender on her own. I'm sorry. It's our fault. Do you want to be kicked out of school? Get out of here! Go away! Jandi, are you okay? Yeah, it's not a big deal. You call that nothing? I liked F4 because they're cute, but it turns out they're an awful bunch. So it's the four of them, hanging out together? Not exactly. What do you mean? I think one guy is different from the rest. One guy? Who? This one's a killer. Do you like her as well? Touching the ad will make your hands dirty. Isn't she pretty? I'd have to say she's a goddess from heaven. A goddess? She's not just a pretty face. She's brainy as well. She donates all the money she makes modeling to charity. She even passed the bar exam in France. Her? Do you know her? Sure, she's my idol. Your idol? People expect her to inherit her parent's law firm, but I beg to differ. I think she'll come up with something even greater. She visits Afghanistan and Africa every summer break. This is just my personal opinion, but I hope she ends up marrying a member of a royal family or a president. Like Princess Diana or Audrey Hepburn. The world's princess, who strives for world peace. Something like that. She's just a model. So? The president of France got divorced to marry a model. Who knows? Maybe the future president of a country or a European prince will propose to her. I think it's a very likely scenario. Don't you agree? You're always so noisy. What? I'm just... What do you know? Hey, Gangsan. Aren't you eating? He's been playing computer games all day long. It's not as if you can earn money with that. It emits electromagnetic waves. You be careful, son! You won't be able to have children! I can earn money with this! You don't know anything about cyber jobs. Cyber what? Cyber jobs. The world may be shaped by few of the richest men, but it's people like me who make the world enjoyable. I think the electromagnetic waves have affected his brain. Huh? What's this? It's really scary. What's so scary about that? Honey, you've got it all wrong. He was talking in lnternet jargon. The exact definition is, "lf it's true, it's scary." - Huh? - What? I have big news! Big news? Someone from your school is pregnant! What? Who? It's on the lnternet. Ms. G, a junior at Shinhwa High, is infamous for her naughty lifestyle. She was seen visiting a ob-gyn clinic. Ms. G, a junior? Maybe she's in your class. Could it be a Gil? Gong? There's a Gwon. It's the end of the world. How can a high schooler get pregnant? How could this happen at such a top school? I can't believe such a well-bred girl could do this. Daughters of established families are the worst of all. - Really? - Sure. Breaking news! Ms. G's identity is revealed! What are you looking at? I can't believe one of you made such a big mistake. Let me see what she looks like. She's just a normal girl. She's dated loads of guys She's so dirty and crazy What a tramp! Die, Geum Jandi! Who's the father? Abortion Forbidden You're very quiet today. What? $2.50. Just wait. She's bound to turn up soon. What have you done this time? Are you going to help her out again? What does that mean? Just forget it. Why do you care? If you're not going to help, butt out. You're going against some girl. It's childish and stupid. Do you think she's just some girl? She's more like a crazy animal that doesn't know her place. Whatever she is, it's my rule in life to take such people down. Did you erase it? That's too bad. What about this? Breaking news! Ms. G's identity revealed! Don't you smell something rotting? I can't stand the smell. I've never smelled anything like it. It's truly awful. Sunny, give me your perfume. I can't study in the same classroom as her. I won't tolerate this anymore! What are you going to do? - Speak of the devil. - What? I'm right! She has come here. It's too late to apologize. I won't let this happen anymore. A warning? That's for people like you. Got it? Hey, Ms. Dry Cleaning. Is this your idea of an apology? Why would I apologize to you when I'm the one who deserves an apology? What? Are you picking a fight with me? I already told you I won't put up with this anymore. I made it very clear! Did you see it? Did you see me sleeping with another guy? I've never even kissed anyone before. What did you say to me? Hey! If you do anything like this again, you're dead! She's a piece of work. She landed a kick on his face. It's been so long since things were this exciting. By the way, doesn't Jandi remind you of someone? Yes, I was thinking the same thing. Who is it? Junhui! Don't be silly. No, I think Jandi looks like Junhui. No way! How could you even begin to compare Jandi to Junhui? I'm sure you feel the same. Be quiet. Why do you keep smiling? Did something happen to your head? Don't you get it? What? That girl. I think she's totally into me. What? Junpyo, that's a big jump in logic. None of you qualify as great lovers. Women say "no," but they mean "yes." The more she hates me, the more she's fallen for me. Huh? Think about it. She doesn't want me to get the wrong idea about her. That's why she's pretending to be so innocent. If that's true... She's never been kissed. Because she's waiting for me to be the one to kiss her first. Bravo! Junpyo, you're amazing. You're my friend, but you're pretty amazing. Of course. I thought it was strange that my charisma didn't work on her. Don't you think? She's a real fool. She can't fool anyone with that act. Actually, if a girl is too honest, it's a real burden. Do I have stoop this low to attend school? Oh, geez. I should try to curb my temper. Why did I have to agitate Junpyo? Are you Geum Jandi? Yes. Why? Will you come with us? Huh? Where? I'm a bit busy right now. I was ordered to take you somewhere. By whom? You'll find out soon enough. I have a job to get to. I'm sorry, but I'm busy. Why are you following me? - Not over there? - Nope. We'll check this side. You guys check the other way. Okay. Let's go. Mister, let me go! Let go! Please keep still. Why are you kidnapping me? Let's go. Something smells nice. I must be near a flower bed. It's warm and soft. And someone is touching... My body! Who is it? Do you think she needs liposuction? It won't do her any good. Is the laser ready? The waxing comes first. I think everyone is surprised because it's a first. - The young master has never had a girl over. - Young master? May I ask you something? Yes. Am I still in Korea? Yes, you are. Am I at the Presidential Residence? No. Let me ask one more question. Yes, go ahead, ma'am. Don't call me that. I'm Jandi. Geum Jandi. Yes, Ms. Geum Jandi. Why am I here? I don't know that, ma'am. Where are we going? We'll be arriving very soon. He's waiting for you. Waiting for me? Who? Jihu? You! What are you doing here? This is my house. Your house? So this is where you live? Yeah. Why? What are you up to? I'm not up to anything. Look! Aren't you surprised at yourself? Money can work wonders. An ugly duckling turned into a swan. A swan? It doesn't matter. What are you doing? I never asked for this. Hey, kid. You can be honest about your feelings for me. You must be the type who doesn't say what you mean. Junpyo, this isn't funny. You've kidnapped me and held me against my will. You can be honest with me. No one is around. I'll let you talk to me when we're outside of school. You must be shocked at what I just said. Shall I repeat myself? If you listen to me, I'll let you be my girlfriend when no one is around. Understand? Are you crazy? You must be mad. All the greasy food you eat must've damaged your brain. Me be your what? Forget it. I'm going home. You're the one with the brain damage. Get out of the way. Do you know how much those clothes and that jewelry cost? - A hundred grand. - What? - 1 00,000 bucks? - That's right. But this is nothing. Spend time with me, and you'll end up with even more. You don't want that? Are you out of your mind? I've been kidnapped by a psycho like you. Of course I'm out of my mind! Ever since I saw your face, I felt a bug crawling all over my body. Give me back my uniform right now! What's this? Throw it away! Didn't you hear what I just said? Yes, master. - Fire every single person! - What? Fire everyone who waited on Jandi today. Just look at her hair and her dress. It was totally out of style. Hire new people. Hire only the best. The people who worked on her today are top notch experts. Then find people who charge more. Yes, sir. What is that? What is that? It's a bee! It's coming near me. A bee! Is it gone? Yes, I chased it away. Did you make the tea? I'm sorry, master. You're fired! The bathroom is bigger than my entire house. Geum Jandi. Why'd I go blank? And one more thing. There's something you don't know. You make friends with your heart. You can't expect to buy them. There is nothing money can't buy. Tell me. What's there that money can't buy? Is there really something that money can't buy? If you're so confident, name one thing that can't be bought. I'm so embarrassed. I can't believe this! You again? You took the words out of my mouth. Where are you going next? Home. And you? Me, too. Dressed like that? I have my reasons. Why? We meet under such extreme circumstances. I know. Can I ask you something? Is there anything that can't be bought in life? Something you can't buy even with a million dollars? Nothing? I guess not. - Air. - What? The air. I see. Why didn't I think of that? You're quite a funny character. Wear them. People will call you crazy if you go around without shoes. Who is this? Aren't you Wonder Girl, Gu Junpyo's worst nightmare? What are you doing here? Junpyo isn't in now. I don't have any business with him. Aren't those Jihu's running shoes? Please give them back to him. Wait. Would you like some tea? Did you really say that to Junpyo? Wow, you're amazing! No one's ever made him that angry before. It's Seohyeon. She should be returning to Korea soon. Jihu must really happy. Excuse me. Have the four of you known each other for a long time? Since kindergarten. I can tell something's on your mind. Ask me. I'll try to answer it. I'd be paying you back. Paying me back? We've been having a great time thanks to you lately. Are Jihu and Min Seohyeon acquaintances? Acquaintances? Jihu was in a car accident when he was five. His parents were killed on the spot. He became autistic and didn't hang out anyone, but it was Seohyeon who pulled him back into the world. She's been our friend since childhood. But to Jihu, she's his first love, but also like his mother. She's just so pretty. It must be great to have a daughter like her. Even though I'm a woman, I think she's so beautiful. Min Seohyeon! Mom, is that Min Seohyeon? The heavens can be so unfair. She was born with a great looks, intelligence, and a good family. And you? God gave her wide shoulders. Not eating? It's enough to make her lose her appetite. She knows she should go on a diet. By the way, will she practice law or continue modeling? Practice law, of course. She's worked so hard to pass the bar. I prefer her as a model. Men can be so simple. She can model while she's young and be a lawyer when she's older. You're so smart, mom! Jandi! No more tangerines? I need to leave some to pack Jandi's lunch. Dad. What's this? What is it? Honey, it's nothing. What is this? Thunderbird, $5. Typhoon, $20. Rush, $30! Hey! I'll win this time for sure. Get out! You can live with your racehorses. I'd rather change my name to Thunderbird than trust you. Get out! Thunderbird always comes in last. Change your name to something else. Get another name. She's his first love, but also like his mother. Hey, Geum Jandi! Blood. Just look at you. Look at her. Good job. What a joke! It's a sight for sore eyes. Blood from both nostrils. You did well. Wait a second. What were you daydreaming about to be hit in the face? Don't do it! What? Just don't cry anymore. It doesn't fit you. Why do you care? Do I need your permission to cry? And I thought you'd be glad to see me suffer. Is that all you can say to someone wanting to help you? I never asked for your help! Not if you were the last man standing on earth! I'd rather die than ask for your help. Hey! What is it you hate about me? Tell me what it is. I'm tall, handsome, and loaded with money. How... How could you resist me? Are you stupid? Don't you know that you're really unlikeable? You walk like a dork, and just look at your hair. You're really annoying! Are you on something? I'm not finished. It's stupid that the four of you don't wear the uniform. And the worst part is you pick on weak students. How low can you get? - Hey! - Want to hear it again? I hate everything about you! Everything! Oh! School Trip Announcement Shinhwa High, Sophomores and Juniors December 1st to 31st Cruise to 5 European Countries A school trip? What? $20,000? Your school is over the top. How could a school trip cost $20,000? The entire school will be going on the trip? Everyone except me. Are you trying to go somewhere without me? We're not going anywhere. What are you going to do? I'll get a part-time job during the summer. My dad has caused trouble again. Life at home is like walking on thin ice these days. South! You're going south? Why don't you go inside and cook some porridge? I've been begging my parents to send me on a trip. I wish I could make money and play at the same time. To the sea? South? Mom. Really? I'm able to go. But can't I go with Jandi? Really? Will you talk to auntie for me? But we need to be paid $70 a day. See? You guys are going somewhere. Are you planning a trip south? Stop walking around. Isn't Junpyo so cool? I think he's even more cool today. Junpyo. Are you waiting for someone? No. I'm doing some exercises before the long flight. Why did you insist on traveling with the rest of us? You've always preferred your own jet. It's a class trip. I want to make memories during high school. Don't you agree, Jihu? What? Yo, yo, yo! Let's go. What's taking her so long? Isn't that Min Seohyeon? Wow! She looks great. Take a photo. Look at this. - Her face is so pretty. - She has beautiful skin. It's Min Seohyeon! She's so beautiful. Can I have your autograph? Autograph, please! Here. Thank you. - How are you? - Fine. Let's go. I don't like that photo. Hello? I'm sorry. You can't use your phone on the plane. What did you say? Shall I go to the sea or to the river to catch fish? Bottle full of fish. - Put it inside. - Carry it inside. - lsn't it "put?" - I think it's "carry." Again. Shall I go to the sea or to the river to catch fish? Hey, Ms. Laundry! Can you hear me? Hey! Who is that? Gaeul, am I dreaming? I don't think so. Why do I keep hearing his awful voice? I heard you went to the sea. Just look at her. Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were going to Europe. I've been there too many times before. Someone recommended this place to me. What a coincidence. I didn't know you'd be here. Just go on you way. Pretend you didn't see me. Are you okay on that wooden boat? It's a real boat! Don't worry about us! Really? I guess you won't drown though, because you know how to swim. Here we go! Hey Junpyo! Junpyo! Isn't that Min Seohyeon? Hey, Ms. Laundry! What now? Be honest, aren't you glad to see me? Tell me. I bet you were bored out here in the country. I was very happy before I saw you. Since you attend our school, you can join us if you want. I have no plans to go anywhere you are! Geez! We're having a party for Seohyeon. It'll be fun. You should come, too. Yes, I'll be there. I know what you're going to say, but I didn't plan this. Junpyo and Jihu invited you. You must come. Don't you think so? Yeah. But there's one thing the guys left out. Left out? What are you doing? Come here. Let's go. Will this be okay? Sure, of course. If we go inside, there'll be people in worse outfits. It'll be nothing. I'm just really embarrassed. You're the perfect person for the job. Don't worry. Geum Jandi, good luck! Gaeul, I think I should leave. None but the brave deserve love. If I get my hands on those girls, they're dead! Geum Jandi. You fool! You should've known better! I'm such a fool! Geum Jandi! Hey you! You're late. We were looking for you. You haven't taken off your coat yet. Aren't you hot? Not at all. I'm cold because of the ocean wind. I think your dress is too light. It's quite pretty, but you're showing a lot of skin. Let me see your dress. Take off your coat. Why don't we take it off for her? Oh! Isn't that Wonder Woman? Oh, my gosh! Isn't that Wonder Woman? I guess she doesn't know reality from fantasy. You should've asked for a dress. I know you want to be different, but you've gone too far. Is this what regular people do to have fun? It's Wonder Woman. I know what you're trying to do. Let me tell you something. This proves that you're just vulgar. Jihu, take her to my room. What's wrong with Jihu? It's getting quite interesting. Thank you. This wasn't necessary at all. I'm doing it because I want to. Don't feel obliged. I shouldn't have come here in the first place. Didn't Jihu invite you? Any friend of Jihu is a friend of mine. No. He was just being nice. No, Jihu's not like that. And I've never seen him stand out in public. Jihu is quite nice. Jihu is nice? See? You're a special person to him. I've heard Junpyo is giving you a hard time. I heard you proclaimed war against him. Actually... He's just lonely. What? His actions are out of loneliness. Junpyo, lonely? No way. He only gets to see his parents a month out of the year. He was born into a great family. People have been treating him as an heir and not as a human being. Do you know how that feels? Don't lose against him. What? I like you, Jandi. I'm rooting for you. You're all ready. Stand up. They're so pretty. For women, shoes are the most important. Why? Good shoes take you to good places. You're all set. Shall we? It's not right for a gentleman to ignore such a pretty girl. You drank all of this? Get a grip! Yes, I'm a girl. I don't have anything to offer. She's just so manipulative. I knew it from the start. Jihu always smiles when he's talking to you. Isn't Jandi so pretty when she's all dressed up? You can't change who she really is. If Jihu had met you first, he would've liked you. Why did you do this? Because you're so miserable. Who cares? Go away.
