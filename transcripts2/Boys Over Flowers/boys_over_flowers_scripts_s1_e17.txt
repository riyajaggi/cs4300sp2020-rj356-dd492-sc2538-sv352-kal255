 Fishing? Jihu, when do you want to go? Right now! Okay, let's go. Oh, that kid! Mr. President, are you really this happy? Wait until you have your own grandchildren. You'll know what I'm talking about. Okay. What? Are you positive? Give me a straight answer. Did you check their identities? - Mr. President? - Huh?

 Due to rumors about the joint alliance, Shinhwa's stock prices are hitting the roof. There are further rumors that the two families will become in-laws. Do you know what this means? What do you think will happen if things go sour with the JK Group? Our company's stocks will turn into useless pieces of paper. The Shinhwa Group was founded upon your dad and granddad's blood and tears. Would you flush it all down the drain for some fling? Stop it! - Junpyo, get out. - I'm not finished. Junpyo, I want you to treat your fiancee, Jaegyeong, with sincerity. Got it? Answer me! Leave! Aren't you satisfied with ruining my life? Don't butt in. You sold your daughter for a hotel, and now you're selling your son to gain investments. What if you want something more in the future? You've run out of children to bargain with. It's all for your own benefit. And who's the judge of that? What makes you think that it's for our benefit? Never have I thought that you had our best interests at heart. Where do you think your happiness comes from? Happiness, you say? Do you know what true happiness is? I don't have time for such petty matters. Leave Junpyo alone. It's none of your business! I'm not going to stand by and just watch this time. Jihu. What are you... Suam Art Center And you? What are you doing here? I... I have a situation. You're cleaning all on your own? I'm in the middle of cleaning. What are you doing? I already told you I'm great at cleaning. Umm... Thank you. Here. I can't pay you for your help. I'll buy you coffee and take you for a drive, instead. A drive? Jandi, Jandi! Get up. Can you hear me? Get on my back. She's malnourished. She'll be better after some rest. Thank you. Let me put this on you before I leave. I gave her up because you're my friend. I relinquished her because she's your girl. I gave you a chance until the very end. But I won't be patient anymore. Are you anxious now that Junpyo is engaged? Were you going to throw yourself at him? You manipulative wretch. Stop it! The Shinhwa Group was founded upon your dad and granddad's blood and tears. Would you flush it all down the drain for some fling? Jandi, someone is waiting for you at the playground. What is it? It's Junpyo. He... Did something happen to him? He wants to make our relationship official. I'm so happy, I'm going out of my mind. I came running here to tell you. Are you happy for me? Congratulations. Isn't it romantic I'm falling in love with my fiance? Thanks. I'm... I'm just so happy to have a friend to share the news with. Hello. Hello. Junpyo gave me the same cell phone as his as a present. I see. Let's go. - Look this way, please. - Just a second. - Look cozy. - When will you get married? How long have you been dating? Don't they make a really great pair? Yes. Junpyo looks even more dashing. Jaegyeong, stop acting like a tomboy. Please behave yourself, so you don't embarrass Junpyo. Not at all. It's time the wife of Shinhwa's president revamped her image. Jaegyeong, please continue to be bubbly. Thank you. Can we make our exit now? Where are you going? On our first date. You can't follow us around. Okay, okay. Junpyo, treat her well. See you. Excuse me! Hmph. Geez! You've picked up very bad habits. I won't do it. I want to be with grandma. What grandma? Hey, Jun! Jun? Don't call me that. Hey, you! What's with the photo shoot? Look over there. Let go! Buy this for me. Wait up! No. I don't want to ride it. You can ride it on your own. But we're on a date. Are you afraid of heights? Is that it? Who would've thought? I'm not afraid of anything! If you tell me the truth, I won't make you ride it. When the cable car is in the air, I bet you'll be screaming for help. Don't make me look like a fool! Fine, get in! Junpyo and Jandi's First Night Together How are your studies going? It'll be a miracle if I ever make it to medical school. You can work wonders. What? Don't you remember? Jandi, the Wonder Girl. Even if I don't make it to medical school, I can still work at the clinic. Can't you make amends with your grandfather? It was never a fight. I was abandoned. It's not like that. Your grandfather feels miserable. And... And? He misses you... A great deal. What? Why do I get the feeling that you know things better than I do? About me and grandfather. It's just that... Are you going to keep this up? I'm the only one talking. You never cooperate with me when we're together. You're a real fuss. If that's how you feel, you can stop following me around. Well I'm nervous. What? I keep getting nervous. If you show me that you can be trusted, I'll leave you alone. I'll be patient with you. What will it take? Kiss me. Hey, Jun! Wait up! Jun, wait for me! What now? You're annoying me. Please go away. I have 99 things I want to do with my new boyfriend. 99 things? You can do them with someone else. I'm busy. Okay. Then how about just one activity a day? That way, after a hundred days, we'll be real lovers. 1 00 days, my foot. You want to be together that long? Since today's our first date, just let me do two things on my list. Can you take me somewhere? You must've been an otter in your past life. Me? You're like an otter. You're diligent, eccentric, and cute. Plus, you can't live without water. Can't you say I'm like a mermaid? I don't want you to be a mermaid. It's so sad how the mermaid turns into foam. The otter must be hungry. Let's go. Dinner's on me. Hey, monkey. I don't belong here. Try it. It's really delicious. - Junpyo. - Huh? It's Jandi. Jandi, what's up? It must be telepathy. Cha Eunjae Hello, my name is Cha Eunjae. Hold on. Welcome. I'm glad you're here to experience the world of pottery. Thank you. I should be thanking you. What? Usually, only older women visit the studio. It's nice to see someone my age. What sparked your interest in pottery? Oh... Someone I know is into pottery. And you like this person? What? You want to know more about him, so you want to share the experience of making pottery. I know how it feels. Have you had a similar experience? I had a childhood friend. While other kids were playing house, we learned the ropes of the potter's wheel. Did your boyfriend become a potter? Well... He is a potter. But unfortunately, he's not my boyfriend. Oh. Don't look so sorry. The experience made me a stronger person. Take this teacup, for example. It may look fragile, but did you know it's actually strong? It's spun on the potter's wheel thousands of times. At 1,300'C. Yes. After being fired at 1,300'C, it becomes very strong. How do you know this? Oh. I heard someone mention it. My friend was my kiln, and my potter's wheel. Are you over him now? Bring your friend over one day. I'm curious. This is my studio. You should go elsewhere for activities. Son. I know what you do here. Can't we just cooperate? If you're going to intrude, I'm going to move my studio. That's not right. It's better that I leave. Not you. Have you forgotten? The family tradition of pottery making will be passing on to you. I never said I wanted to do it. And you never said no, either. Why do you live like this? I'm bored. Life is so boring, my son. Have you ever been genuine about your life? There's only been one woman whom I wanted to live for. But after letting her go... The rest are the same. Life is a meaningless cycle. Don't you think... You're being too cruel to mom? That's why I hope my life will pass by quickly. Nothing's working out as I want. Do you know why you replaced llhyeon as head of the family? It's because you take after me more than him. Isn't it cruel? Just once a lifetime. You only get one chance. That's yet another cruel statement. It's here. Here are your two servings of rice rolls. Eat jumbo noodles in 20 minutes and get 50 bowls free Enjoy your meal. Excuse me. Yes? Is that for real? Yes. It's really hard to finish in time. Want to try? Will you really give 50 bowls for free? Sure. Who's up for the challenge? Me! Hey, monkey. What are you doing? Jandi, want to try it? Fine, I'll win it for you. Don't do it. Who do you think you are? What if I can eat it? What? If I win, all of you have to make my wish come true. Your wish? Okay. Great. I'd like to try the challenge. Start. Five, four, three, two, one. Success! Jandi, your present. Now for my wish. So what's your wish? Let's go on a trip. What? Just the four of us. Jandi, Jihu, you, and me. Let's go on a double date to a resort. Hey, monkey. I hate double dates. You can't say that. You promised. Jandi, will you go with us? Please? What kind of monster are you? How could you eat all that? I can't believe it. Jandi, let's go. Jihu, please. Mom, please don't die! Don't die. I found you. Do you think mom will die? She'll get better. Yijeong, where are you? Ilhyeon is calling you. How'd you find me? I can find you wherever you are. You can't leave until I fall asleep. Mind if I sleep? Eunjae. Can't you... Come back to see me? The only person who came to see me... Was you. Good morning. Hey, monkey. What are you doing here? Why are you so rude to your fiancee? It's okay. I think it's his way of expressing his love. I've already adapted to it. You're making me look like a fool. This is why girls from good families are different. You have such a pretty heart. It's not something you can buy. No. I've made a friend recently who isn't well off, but she's so nice and pretty. A friend? Monkey, aren't we going? What? If we're too late, traffic will be bad. See you! Have a great time. It's this way. Hello. Wait a second. Ta-da! What do you think? Think Junpyo will like it? I've always hated presents, but I guess people do change. I just want to show everyone that he's mine. J and J? Junpyo and Jaegyeong. I had this special feeling, having it engraved. I feel like he really is mine. J and J. You're right. Let me try. What do you think? - It's not any good. - Excuse me. Can you get dinner ready for us? Yes, barbeque. Jandi, eat up. Here. No more. Jandi, Jandi. Jandi, are you okay? Wake up! Jandi, are you okay? Junpyo. You don't know how to swim. I know now. How's it possible? I learned to swim. Don't lift your chin up, just to the side. You're not supposed to bend your knees. I'd rather drown than see someone else save you. So I learned. What happened? Jandi, are you okay? She's fine. What a relief. I'll take her from here. Yes, make sure she gets some rest. Are you okay? I'm fine. Two lattes. - Which cake is the best? - Cake? We have chocolate cake and cheesecake today. I think cheesecake is better with lattes. Two pieces of cheesecake, please. - Two? - Yes. Okay, anything else? What's wrong? Are you crazy? No. Nothing wrong. It's made me realize something. What? What did you realize? Do you remember... What grandfather told us? What are you trying to say? You're the chosen one. Not me. Ilhyeon. Your hands. You never know how I wanted your hands. So... You're going to quit? You're going it alone? You're just running away! You're pushing evertyhing on me! You're running off by yourself! Are you okay? I keep forgetting that I can't swim anymore. Do I have to be your lifeguard now? I forgot something. I'll be right back. Don't worry. I won't cause trouble anymore. I'll take her from here. What?
