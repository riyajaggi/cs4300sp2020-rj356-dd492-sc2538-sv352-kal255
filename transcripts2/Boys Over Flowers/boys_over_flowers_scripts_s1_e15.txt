 I'm sorry. Can I borrow your guitar? Why? You want to play? I'm sorry. I'll pay you with my egg tarts. Can you borrow your guitar just once? This should be enough. I can't believe I've broken a heel in Macau. I should take them off. - Let's go. - Get on my back. What? Or do I have to carry you? But... Okay. - Thank you. - Thanks. No need to thank me. I should be the one to thank you. This is the first time. The first time I've earned my own money. I see. You've lead me to many first experiences. So, thank you. Shall we go back now? Just a bit longer. Sir. Let's go now. The door isn't locked. Jandi. Come out. Are you going to be inside all day? Fine. I'm going out for a second. I'm going out. So have something to eat. Memory Deleted Flight to Seoul at 1 8:00 First class? My seat is first class? Yes. It's expensive. I can take a normal seat. Can you get a refund? A normal seat? Are you talking about economy? My legs are too long for economy. What? Your legs are long. I can fly economy, though. It's not easy to meet Jaegyeong. She's all over the place. I've checked to see that she's returning from Hong Kong. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. Not at all. Nothing is more important than having Junpyo meet Jaegyeong. Don't you agree, Junpyo? Junpyo? What? Yes, you're right. What's wrong? The Singapore office is looking for Junpyo right away. This is such an important meeting. The Prime Minister... It's not a problem. Junpyo will meet Jaegyeong soon enough. There's nothing more important than business. You should get going. Excuse me. They're... Do you like them? What's going on? I wanted to buy you something with the first money I ever earned. Jihu. Why are you here? I don't need to answer that. And what are you doing here? You don't have a right to ask that. Yun Jihu! I gave her up because you're my friend. I relinquished her because she's your girl. I gave you a chance, until the very end. But I won't be patient anymore. Stop it! Why are you here? Do you have something to say? Fine, then. I'm leaving. Sir, please get up. Here's your porridge. Enjoy your meal. Miss! This isn't abalone porridge. I'm sorry. I'll get you a new batch. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. Gaeul, aren't I pathetic? I know I have to focus on my future. But I'm always getting into trouble. Jandi. Run an errand for me. I'll go instead. Where to? Jandi, the job's yours. Deliver this dish. Stay with the customer until he's done eating. Don't come back without the plate. Wait a second. Your blood pressure is normal. Open your mouth. Hey you, outside! Me? Don't just stand there. Come and help me. Hurry up! Don't you see patients waiting? You must be cold. Have some of this. - Thank you. - Sure. Eat up. Oh, thanks. - Thank you. - Welcome. What are you looking at? Light exercise is fine. Don't cry. Look at this? What is it? What is it? You should be sleeping at home! Here. I'm not going home until you eat it all. Please finish it. But mister? What's your job? And how do you know my boss? Are you really a doctor? Maybe... You're a quack? You think I'm a quack? A little? Doctor! My abdomen hurts. Doctor, my abdomen. My abdomen hurts so much. Please hang in there. I'd like a glass of milk, too. Jihu. Here. Any good news to share? How'd you know? It's written all over your face. That's it. Hold onto her hand. That's it. A bit more. We're almost there. Just a bit more. Yes, you're doing great. It's almost over. Yes, that's it. Well done. - My baby. - You did well. My baby is here. Isn't it pretty? I had goosebumps all over. It was like discovering a whole new world. For the first time, I forgot about Junpyo or swimming. I know people would call me crazy. And I know people would laugh at me if I wanted to be a doctor. Jandi. You're crazy. You're out of your mind. But it's wonderful to find something you really love doing. It's not easy to discover your interests. Who cares what other people say? You've never cared about what other people say anyway. Jihu. If you want to do something, just do it. Even if it takes years? Even if it takes ages. To Jandi's new dream! Cheers! Give us a comment. I'll be holding a press conference soon. Sir. Shinhwa's success begins now. Just you wait. Jandi? It's you. Here. I heard you were in Macau. Actually... I wanted to talk to Junpyo before going on with my life. I think it was the right choice. I'm over him now. I truly hoped that you'd be by Junypo's side. It's too bad. I hope we can still be friends. Sure, of course. What happened? Why are you the star and I'm the moon? Because you're a moon that will never stray from my star. No matter what happens, I'm not going to let you go. It's okay. Go ahead and cry it out. Just let it all out. Actually, I lied to you. I'm not okay. I wanted to see Junpyo. But I can't believe he's turned into someone else. Jandi. Jandi, thank you. I'm really glad you've told me this. Listen to me carefully. Junpyo will come back to you, so don't give up on him. Trust me. Just give him a chance. Can you do that? Huh? Gaeul. Junpyo's birthday party? Yes. You want me to bring Jandi to his party? Why would I do that? Junpyo dumped Jandi. I have this feeling. Let's just call it a hunch. But Jandi will get hurt if your hunch is wrong. Gaeul, listen carefully. If it's all an act on Junpyo's part, it's a relief. Even if what Junpyo says is true, Jandi needs to see him once more. Wouldn't that be like killing her twice? If Junpyo isn't right for Jandi, then it's better to erase him from her mind. I taught you this already. What's all this? You need weapons when going to war. No, I don't want to go. Are you never going to see him again? You want to end it like this? Junpyo is back in Seoul. And it's his birthday. You can just attend the party. Don't you have anything you want to say to Junpyo? What hurts me most... Is not that he ignored me. Nor the fact that he didn't stop me from leaving. I never had a chance to thank him or tell him how I felt. I'll never get that chance again. Welcome. Hello, Jandi. Hello. How may I help? Junpyo's birthday party will be held today. Did Junpyo send you? No. The chairman is hoping that you'll attend. The chairman? It's F4! You're here. I came because I didn't want to run away. But maybe it was the wrong choice. Jandi, since you're here anyway, have a bite to eat. If you hang out alone, Gaeul will feel uneasy. I thought Jandi was a very loyal friend. Isn't that right, Gaeul? I'd like to thank all of you for coming to congratulate the Shinhwa Group and my son, Junpyo. As you know, we've been hit with hard times. But we were able to cope thanks to all of you here today. Until the day that Shinhwa becomes the world's leading corporation, I hope you'll continue to support our enterprise. Let me introduce the man of the day. My son and future of the Shinhwa Group, Gu Junpyo. ?? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you ?? ?? Happy birthday, dear Junpyo Happy birthday to you ?? Are you okay? I think I should get going now. I shouldn't have come. Long time no see, Jandi. Thank you for accepting my invitation. Invitation? Can you play Junpyo a song while you're here? What? You were raised by great parents. I know that you're very smart and received a great education. Can you play a piece for us on the piano? No way. Can't Jandi play the piano? I guess she can't. I knew there was a reason she invited Jandi today. Jandi is quite tired. I'll do it. Since you invited me, I want to play my part. I'll do it. Geum Jandi from Shinhwa High School will be playing a piece on the piano. Please give her a round of applause. ?? The moment I stood next to you ?? ?? I noticed your nice eyes ?? ?? I cried yesterday ?? ?? But I know I'll be happy today ?? ?? Thanks to you ?? ?? Your face... ?? ?? Not just your face ?? ?? Not just your cool manner ?? ?? I need only love that's warm ?? ?? Try to forget the past ?? ?? I can't live a day without you ?? ?? Love is the only thing that counts ?? Maybe it was a mistake to ask her to play. People should know their own place. And know when to stand out and when not to. I'll apologize on her behalf. I know you've been waiting for a long time. I'll be making an important announcement that will affect the future of the Shinwha Group. An important announcement? We have with us today the fiance of my son, Junpyo. She'll be the Shinhwa family's new daughter-in-law. What? Fiance? What did my mom just say? Let me introduce her to you. This is Ha Jaegyeong, the heiress of the renowned JK Group. Let me go! You know I hate this. An engagement? What engagement? Let go! I can walk on my own. You with the shoes? Hey, you! He's engaged? With the daughter of the JK Group? Junpyo's mother never goes wrong. Is the JK Group that powerful? The chairman is Korean American and the company is based in the States. It owns oil fields and resorts. It's a global enterprise. I should've seen it coming in Macau. I thought you were a thoughtless bunch, but that's quite an accurate analysis. Do you get it now? Not just anyone can become the daughter-in-law in the Shinhwa family. What are you doing? What's with the engagement? And why are you here? It's not as if I wanted to come. I invited her. What? I was going to introduce your future wife. Your friends should be here to congratulate you. Are you stupid? Why'd you come? Junpyo, the two of you should go somewhere quiet to talk. I have nothing else to say to Junpyo. I guess you've realized the reality of the situation. You shouldn't have anything to say to a man who is engaged. About the engagement... It's not like we're on a reality show. Is it for real? I'm sorry to surprise you, but I've already discussed it with your parents. It's the first time I'm hearing this. Hey, you! Keep quiet. You have nothing to say to me? Well I do. So follow me now. Why are you so thoughtless? You should've known my mother was up to something. Wait a second. You're still so naive even though you're a year older. You should've known my mother had something up her sleeve. Wait. My mom tricked both of us. You're such a sucker to her tricks. Hey, you! What? Who do you think you are? I hope this teaches you not to have false hopes. I'm glad I had reason to invite you. Bye. Jandi, what's wrong with Junpyo? Is he really going to marry her? I'll take Gaeul home. Jihu... Let's meet at our spot. I'll try to assess the situation. What are you doing here? You dragged me here! So why were you dragged here? I knew you were strange from that first day in Macau. You're really funny. What? Look at me. My shoulders are bare in the middle of winter. And my shoes have come loose. Shouldn't you be apologizing first? Who told you to follow me out here? I never followed you here. Okay, then. Go do your thing. Don't follow me anymore. That jerk! Hey! What are you doing? Tell me that you're sorry. Get down. Apologize! Aren't you going to apologize? Hey, monkey! Get down right now! Come down. What did you just do? Why is your face so red? Are you shy? Shut your mouth and go away. Why are you pestering me? What? Give me some money. What money? I need cab fare. I came out here empty-handed. I don't have any money. I don't have any money! Your phone! My phone? What are you doing? Stop touching me. What are you doing? Are you a pervert? Who are they? Let me go! Do you know who I am? Miss, are you okay? Let go! Are you in shock? What? About Junpyo's wedding. No. I don't care whether Junpyo is engaged or not. You know that. I don't think Junpyo knew about it, either. About the engagement. If he knew about it, he would've told us. No. That other woman. She's someone Junpyo knows. How do you know? I saw her before in Macau. I'll be going now. Jandi. What you told Junpyo in Macau... I know. I was just mad at Junpyo when I said those things. You're right. I'm totally fine. Don't worry. Jandi. What you see may not be the truth. There are things... That are visible only when you have faith. I'll go alone. I can go alone. Good night. So long. Yun Jihu. What are you doing? Calling Gu Junpyo What is that girl doing here? This is a piece that Queen Elizabeth liked. Thank you. I'll use it as Leon's bowl. I've met a lot of women in my life, but no one like her. Now for the emergency measure. The emergency measure? - It's fascinating. - What is? How can you work so hard in evertyhing you do? Jihu! Jihu! What? Yijeong is doing what? A date. Don't you know Jiyeong's nickname? His nickname? No! So what? Junpyo is in a hotel right now? I keep wanting her.
