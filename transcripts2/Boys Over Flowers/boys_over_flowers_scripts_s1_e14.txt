 Boys Over Flowers (2009): Season 1, Episode 14 - Episode #1.14 - full transcript 
 Still in Macau, China, Ji Hoo, Yi Jung and Woo Bin finally contrive to see Joon Pyo, who firmly makes it plain he's outgrown them and Jan Di. As a favor to a friend, Ji Hoo privately asks that he meet Jan Di one last time. He does, but their reunion is cold. It would seem their relationship has run its course, but in private Joon Pyo chafes badly. His undisclosed Devil's bargain with Hee Soo, for Jan Di's sake, leaves him deprived of love and friends, and festering. Unaware of Joon Pyo's severe personal sacrifice, Ji Hoo revitalizes Jan Di with a day-long tour of city pleasures. At its end, he encounters old childhood friend Ming, who encourages the pair to stay at his place (but who has obvious eyes for Hi Joo alone).

 Episode 14 What's that sound? She should be fired. She's totally out of tune. That person... Is she someone you know? I hope she's not Korean. What a shame! She is Korean. She's actually really cool. How do you know her?

 She's my savior. What? But that's us. Hello. Hello and welcome. It's really nice to finally be meeting you. Hello. How do you do? It must be great to have such a wonderful son. I've been waiting for Jaegyeong. It's a blow not to see her. She's probably traveling all over Macau right now. She has a mind of her own. I've heard she's quite a character. I have high expectations. Don't expect too much. Ma'am, all is ready.

 Come with me. The Shinhwa Group's goal for 2020 is to make lncheon into a tourist zone for South Korea. Scores of top-notch hotels and entertainment facilities will make it Asia's star resort area. To execute the project, Shinhwa needs cooperation from the JK Group, having been successful in transforming Las Vegas and Macau. Joining Shinhwa's strong foundation with the JK Group's expertise, will bring the plan to fruition even faster than expected. New history will be written in Korea. I'm hungry. Let's go eat. Okay. Jandi, just you wait. There's a great restaurant here. Let's go. What's wrong? No seats? Don't worry, buddy. Junpyo's name works every time. Let's go elsewhere. Why? Are you craving some ltalian? I know of a restaurant run by a great ltalian chef. Come on, guys. You have a photo message. Would you like to open it? I'd like to make a toast. For the unity of the Shinhwa Group and the JK Group. Cheers! Are you okay? With what? Coming here. No regrets? I don't get to come here every day. I've always dreamed of backpacking somewhere. What's your plan? I don't have one. I just wanted to see Junpyo. And ask how he's doing. All I wish is that I could say hello to him. Isn't it strange? What? The time we spent together seems like so long ago. If Junpyo decides to ignore me, the past will be just a dream. It's not a dream. If it were a dream, my heart wouldn't have been broken. What? You've helped me realized something. I wasn't able to do anything. When I came to my senses, I was already on the plane. So it's not a dream. Right now, you're next to me. Sleep tight. Ji... Okay, okay! Go away. If you weren't the hotel's manager, I'd fire you on the spot. Keep it up. You'll be inspecting the construction site at 1 0:00. At 1 1 :00, you'll hop on your jet for Singapore. At 5:00, you have a meeting with the mayor of Macau. And... And what? Why didn't you finish your sentence? You should take time out for your F4 friends. I don't have time. They've been waiting since yesterday. You know I'm really busy. Should I cancel my appointments to spend time with them? You think I should do that? No. What's wrong with the grass here? What a day I'm having! Yijeong Yes, it's me. What a strange place to be meeting with the mayor. Is he an athlete? I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry. Hey, yo! How are you? It's been a long time. Hi. I guess we had no choice but to seek you out, since you're just so busy. Good to see you. Do you mean it? You don't seem happy to see us. Don't be a jerk. Hey, Jandi is here, too. Actually, Jandi came here first to see you. Have you seen her yet? Why would I want to see her? What? I don't care about her anymore. Junpyo. Is that why you haven't been in touch with her? It was intentional? Intentional or not, I didn't have time for such petty matters. Petty matters? Junpyo, are you serious? Is this all you want to talk about? Be a man! What? All of you date girls and then break up. Aren't I allowed to do the same? I may have broken up a lot of times, but never like you! Yijeong, calm down. Let go! What did you say when I tried to stop you from dating Jandi? You said you'd be responsible for her until the end. Did you really believe me? Don't tell me you really thought it would last. Hey! Don't you know Jandi can't swim because of you now? - Get up. - Yijeong, calm down. How do you expect me to calm down? Listen to what he said! You didn't know it would come to this? I warned you. I told you not to get ahead of yourself, stupid coward! What are you doing? Have you become Jandi's bodyguards? Junpyo. We can hang out if you're here as my friends, but if you want to talk about Jandi, leave now. Why have you changed so much? - 700,000. - What? That's the number of people who work for the Shinhwa Group. 700,000 people. Think of all that weight on your shoulders. I have no choice but to change. Jandi! How is Junpyo? What's wrong? Nothing. He's become really strange. What? Jandi should know the truth. There have been a lot of changes. Junpyo must be really stressed out. He doesn't want to see me? How'd you know? So you knew about it? Don't worry about me so much. I came to hear what Junpyo has to say. I'll face him head on. That a girl! The air is refreshing. Do you remember? - What? - What we used to do as children. Here. Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! - Rock, paper, scissors! - Nice! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six. Flve, four, three, two, one! Here I come! I have a favor to ask, as a friend. Tell me. Please meet her once. Why's that? I'm asking you as a friend. And why are you asking me? This is the only thing I can do for her right now. I'm off. What's wrong? I was about to head to the airport. I want to say goodbye from here. There's something I need to say before I leave. After today ends, I don't think I can say it. I'm really happy to have met you. I'll be back. Jihu? Sorry to wake you. What's the matter? You're coming with me. Now? Isn't it strange to be out so early in the morning? We're almost there. Huh? You have to go alone from here. He'll be on that bridge. This is the reason you're here. Jihu! Hi, it's me. Hi. What are you doing here? I've been really worried about you after hearing about your dad. Thanks. But... You came all the way here to tell me that? Things must be going well for you. What? I'm doing very well. I'm a very busy person. You can leave now. You don't have to ask me how I'm doing. What? Do you have more to say? Really? Is this really how you feel? What do you want from me? Don't tell me you were expecting me to say sorry. Or that I'll be returning to you. Is that what you expected me to say? What's wrong with you? I've woken up to reality. Okay. Now I understand. So you were trying your best not to see me. All of that was intentional. So I'm just someone you... Want to erase from my memory. You're awful now, Junpyo. You're really awful. No. I've always been this way. I was just pretending to be someone else. I'm leaving. Goodbye. Don't worry about me. Excuse me. A lucky lady? A song. Please sing me a song. Junpyo and Jandi's first night together From today onward, I proclaim that Jandi has become my official girlfriend. Can you see my heart? Let me go! Sir. You may leave. Satisfied now? Are you happy that you've gotten what you want? Well... It bothers me that the girl is still an issue. She's not just a girl. I... Your son loved her. She's the first woman I ever loved. Yes. So what? You want to throw evertyhing away and run to her? Forget about the employees at Shinhwa and your future? And what about your father? Stop it. You may give up the company in an instant, but your father worked his entire life for it. Will you let him down? Stop it. And what about Jandi? Shall I make it so that she can never live in Korea? Be quiet. I told you to stop! Jandi... Don't touch her. If you break your promise, I'm going to break evertyhing in sight. Hey, pretty lady. Would you like to buy some ice cream from me? I'm sorry. I don't speak Chinese. What did you say? Hey, ugly lady. Please buy my ice cream. You're not such a great salesman. I know you'll buy it. How much is it? The entire day? What? In exchange for this ice cream, spend the day with me. I hope Jandi is doing okay. Don't worry. No news is good news. I'm sure she's having a great time with Junpyo. Gangsan, go to the toilet if your stomach hurts. Stop stalling. What's wrong? - Gangsan. - Gangsan. - Hey. - Gangsan. - Gangsan! - Are you sick? What's wrong? - Hey. - Something's strange. Hey, wake up! Get him on my back. Hey, Gangsan. - Do you eat regularly? - Yes. - Do you sleep well? - Yes. Your blood pressure is normal. - Haena. - Yes? Would you like some candy? Yes. Okay. That's a good girl. Let's shake. So cute. - Bye. - See you. - Goodbye. - So long. - Excuse me! - Doctor! - Here! - Doctor! Anyone here? - Help! - Doctor! - Any doctors around? - Help us! Our kid is ill. Please check him. Pretty. It's time. Let's go. This is mine. I picked it out. I had my eyes on it first. Let go of it. I can't. Let go. Ma'am, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. But can you yield that shoe? What? Do you know her shoe size? Her size? Hey, can you try them on? Hey, hey. What are you doing? Hey! They fit perfectly. - Take them off. - No. Take them off now. Come here. Who is he? He must be crazy. Are you okay? What took you so long? The others left without us. What shall we do? We should go as well. Let's take the morning flight. What's she doing now? Are you talking about Jandi? Yijeong and Wubin have left for Seoul. Jihu and Jandi are leaving tomorrow. I guess Jandi finally knows her place. Where is Junpyo? He's been in the boardroom all evening. He's finally come to his senses. Junpyo. Can you hear me? I've been doing some thinking. All we ever did was fight. But it's strange. The memories I have of you are mostly about our fights, but I still smile when I think of you. Gu... Gu Junpyo! How are you? When are you coming back to continue our fights? Junpyo, come with me. - Have you seen the plane? - No. - lsn't she a beauty? - Yes. This is the propeller. You'll have to fly one later on. This is the steering wheel. Okay. Do you see all these gauges? You'll have to learn all this soon. Who are you? Gu Junpyo. Junpyo? I'm your son. What are you going to do when I'm not around? I'm going to protect the Shinhwa Group with Junhui and mom. Junpyo. Can you promise me as a man? Yes, sir! Promise. Hey, Jihu! Hey, Jihu! Ming. Jihu, what are you doing here? When did you arrive? A few days ago. Long time, no see. Why didn't you tell me you were in Macau? I really wanted to see you. How long will you be here? I'm leaving now. No! No. I can't let you go like this. Jihu, come to my house. I have company. Who is she? Don't tell me she's your girlfriend. So will you stick around if she allows it? I'm Jihu's friend from Juilliard. I see. Nice to meet you. I'm very sick right now, so please do me a favor. What? Come to my house, just for a day. Oh, okay. Let's go. One more day won't hurt. It's been a really long time. Right? Yeah. Wow, it looks delicious. It's a meal fit for a king. Your vocabulary is amazing. You speak great Korean. Jihu's Korean. Oh. So you learned Korean because of Jihu? No! This is only for Jihu. It looks delicious. Bon appetit! Jihu, eat up. That girl isn't pretty. She's short and flat-chested. And she eats too much. What do you want me to say? Is she you girlfriend? What do you think? I think you like her. What? You smile every time you see her. Just like before. Before? You used to be like that with Seohyeon. Look for Jandi's room number. What? She checked out? Okay. It's time to head for Shanghai with your mother. When did Jihu leave? I think he's still here in Macau. Really? He didn't check out? He went to his friend's house with Jandi. His friend? Which friend? Shall I find out? No, forget it. When are we having a snack? Huh? She's asking about the snack. You have to take that off. What's with the face? Call Junpyo. Jandi is in trouble. Wait. When are we having our snacks? Food, food, food! Cut! Just put your mouth on hers. Think of it as a picnic, and look at each other. Cut, okay!
