 Boys Over Flowers (2009): Season 1, Episode 19 - Episode #1.19 - full transcript 
 Jan Di and Ga Eul come to the aid of Ji Hoo and Yi Jung, respectively, as both boys suffer, one from an emotional confrontation and the other from overindulgence. Losing a bet, Joon Pyo becomes Jae Kyung's servant for a day, which entails grocery shopping for Jan Di. As Jan Di's return isn't till well past dawn, Joon Pyo berates her, which prompts her to stand up to his scolding by confronting his lame "play" at independence. Hee Soo, meanwhile, discovering her son's been with Jan Di again, has her goons manhandle him back home, but she's not done. As Ji Hoo, upon learning that Jan Di's taken a smaller apartment, visits along with Yi Jung, Woo Bin and Ga Eul to give her a proper housewarming, Hee Soo arrives to browbeat Jan Di with another personal downgrading, additionally telling them all to leave her son alone. Now a virtual prisoner in his own mansion, Joon Pyo finds reprieve through Jae Kyung taking him along on a visit to Jan Di's. With all friends on hand, a game of Truth of Dare crops up, bringing underlying issues toward the surface, but a malicious act soon comes to shatter Jan Di's world even further.

 Junpyo! Episode 19 You again? I guess we're on the same page. I had a feeling I'd see you here. Did you lose your cell phone? It's polite to call someone before you pay them a visit. Didn't anyone teach you common sense? Life is tough. Actually, nobody taught me about that. Is that what you do?

 Hey, monkey! Get up! Why are you on my bed? Get up! Get up now! Get up. Come on. Want to make a bet? What kind of bet? Go, Junpyo! No, no! Hope you win. No! No! I won!

 - I won't go easy on you. - I'll beat you. Good luck! You're doing great! I won again! You can't even win once. I've had enough. The controller's broken. You didn't win. Hey! Stop drinking. It'll slow down your recovery. Recovery? Why do I need to recover? Who cares if I can't make good pottery? I'll always be able to ask women out. Yijeong, you've come so far. What's wrong with you? Sir, it's about your mother. What happened? She's in the hospital and is asking for you. Tell her I'm busy. Where are you going? If you don't want to see me go insane, let go of me. Gaeul. You asked me out last time. Does your offer still stand? If you were going to run away, you shouldn't have asked me out in the first place. There's still more to come. Is Gaeul your name? Take your time eating. The food here is the best there is. Thank you. Do you like Gaeul? How could I not like such a cute and nice lady? I guess I take after you, dad. Here I am on a date when mom's in the hospital. And you're here, having dinner with a pretty girl and barely even thinking about mom. That's what they mean by "like father, like son." Let's discuss family matters later. What do you want to talk about? If she's your type, should I lend her to you? Yijeong! Why do you look so upset? She's almost the same age as your last lover. What do you say, Gaeul? Isn't my dad cool? Excuse me. You were very cruel to her. Why'd you bring me here? The loser has to keep quiet. Did you forget the rules? You promised to be my servant. When? I hate nothing more than people who tell lies. Haven't you heard the saying? "Real men don't tell lies." Real men don't tell lies? Just come on. Real men don't tell lies? Oh! I get it now. Why are you buying so much? Hey. Hey! - I don't want it. - Just one bite. - lsn't it good? - Yeah. Taste good? Your wife is very beautiful. You make a great couple. Thank you. Did you hear that? He said I'm pretty. And you believe him? Thank you. He just wants you to buy something. That's not true. No! Thank you. Hey! Where are we? Jandi moved here. She and her brother live alone. I'm worried about her. Let's go. Here. You're doing me favors again. You did a favor for me, too. Would you like to come in for some tea? I have some green tea. Oh. Your grandfather's already home for the nightt. Relax. I'll fix the tea. Thank you, doctor. Having fun yet, Jihu? - Yes, grandpa. - Good. Let's go fishing! I'm going to catch a huge shark. Fishing? When do you want to go? Right now. Okay, then. Wow! Something smells great. Me first. No. I know you'll just eat it all yourself. - Hey. - What? This girl is a total pig. We have to stop her. Who'll stop me? I paid for it. Stop it! That's plenty. Hey! Hey! What about you? I always eat instant noodles. What would you rather have? Pizza! I wish I could eat pizza all day long. What a silly thing to wish for. Don't eat this. Let's eat something else. I'm so full. What's taking Jandi so long? Why don't you give her a call? She doesn't have a cell phone. What? No cell phone? She gave it to mom and dad in case there's an emergency. That's interesting. I see. Let's go. Go where? What? Come on. Welcome. That one, please. This one? Just a moment. This is the one I mentioned. Can I see this? We want to see the same model. Well, we were here first. You must be working hard these days, Mr. CEO. I'm so proud of you. I called you earlier about a phone. Jihu. I'm sorry. Jihu, it's all my fault. What? I'm the one to blame. I was responsible for the death of my parents. I was the only one who survived. I guess you hated me. It's not your fault. I'm the one to blame. Jihu! 1 5 years... You should've told me that 1 5 years ago. You know what? I bet you never knew how much I yearned for you. - Jihu. - I bet you never knew. If only you knew how I wanted to cry in your arms. Oh, my poor boy. Don't ever call me that again. Jihu. Sir? Sir! I'm fine. Go after Jihu. Hurry. Jihu! Jihu! Jihu! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa... I was too afraid that he'd cry. Just like his father and mother. I didn't want to make him cry. So I ran away. Why didn't you come home last night? Well... Why should I feel bad? I didn't do anything wrong. It's personal. Don't you know the meaning of privacy? Jandi, stop being so ignorant. It's not privacy. It's pride. Have you heard of it? What? Where are you going? If that's the case, I'll ask the English teacher about it! Hey! Tell me where you were last night! No! That girl. I can't let it go this time. - How is evertyhing? - Fine. How's Junpyo doing? He went to school. And Jaegyeong? While you were away, she came to visit Junpyo often to spend time with him. Really? What a relief. But... Do you have anything else to report? What? Mr. Jeong. I know that you're busy working on my behalf. You know that Junpyo isn't easy to deal with. It's too early to ease up. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Look into it right away. Yes, ma'am. What a tough job. Why don't you go back to your own neighborhood? I told you this is my training. You have a driver who picks you up whenever you want. You go home to change and order takeout. What part of that is training? I sleep here. I sleep in a tiny place infested with roaches. My legs are killing me. Isn't that enough? No one asked you to do this. No one expects this from you. So stop making things hard for yourself. You're not going to tell me? About what? Well... I'm not interested in your personal life. I'm just worried about you. Hey! I'm talking to you. Hey! Are you Gangsan? Yes, I am. Come with me. Go For lt, Gangsan! Help Yourself Eat your heart out. Junpyo? Is it good? Dig in. Let us have some, Gangsan! Get in line! Welcome. Jihu... What are you doing here? I went to Jandi's place. I guess you didn't hear. She moved. She moved? Help yourself... It's just too quiet here now. Why won't this light? Hey! Mr. Jeong, it's me. Why won't the stove work? I'm talking about the fire. I can't light it! Just get over here! That was fast. Mr. Jeong. Let go! Let go of me! Let go! Let go of me! Let go! Gangsan. Hey. Who is it? Hi. Hey, yo! Jihu? What are you doing here? We came here for a housewarming party. That's only when you're invited. Is it just the two of you? It's not that bad. It's quiet, safe, and... The rent is very low. It's practically free. What happened to Junpyo? Excuse me. Who's that? You're very popular. Wait here. Who is it? Who is it? What are you doing here? I can't believe you're here in the middle of the night. I can't believe my eyes. Junpyo's not here. I know where my son is. How can I help you? When an adult visits you, you should greet them properly. And you should offer me a seat. Don't you have any manners? This is why being educated by your family is important. Would you like to come in? Forget it. I'd rather talk out here. You must have a great talent for seducing men. You've got the wrong idea. If you don't like my assumption, give me an excuse. I don't think I've done anything to warrant hearing that. Over there. What you did over there contradicts what you just said. You secretly called someone over who's already engaged. And you say you didn't do anything wrong? That wasn't my fault. Junpyo decided to move here. I know that girls like you can come up with plenty of excuses. You can't help it if Junpyo keeps coming on to you. That's why I came here. To ask you a favor. Even if Junpyo comes by, don't meet him. If what you say is true, you and Junpyo have no reason to meet. Can I trust you? Let me trust you and your high sense of pride. This is why I don't want you guys hanging around with Junpyo. Please think about your parents. Let's go, Mr. Jeong. Yes, ma'am. Don't be hurt by what she said. She's always like that. She's like that to us. What did she mean about Junpyo moving here? What's all this? It's our housewarming gift, Jandi. What? Ready? You've been grounded, sir. You should be more careful. How'd my mother find out? I guess I wasn't careful enough. Excuse me. Jaegyeong is here to see you. Why is she back? Why not? I'm your fiancee, remember? I'm not in the mood for you. Just go. Really? I was about to ask you to visit Jandi with me. I'll just go by myself. Where are you going? To Jandi's house. We had instant noodles last time. I want to give her this. If you're asking me as a favor, I guess I can go with you. - Really? - Under one condition. Tell my mother about it. Don't worry. I told her we'd be on a date. Let's go. I don't want to. Come on. I really don't. Get dressed. Want some more sausages, Gangsan? Out like a light. Gangsan, don't lie there like that. Get up. Hey, Gangsan. He's fast asleep. This feels so nice. I haven't felt like this in a long time. It's like being on a picnic. Since we're a bit bored... Don't tell us you want to kiss us. I'm all for it. Want to play a game? A game? A game you can't leave out of a picnic. What? Truth or dare. Truth or dare? I'll play, too! You can ask any question you want. How do we know they're not lying? Lies aren't allowed. But you have the right to remain silent. Remain silent? If you don't want to answer a question... You have to kiss. What's wrong with you? It sounds like fun. Alright. A full-on kiss. No. How about a kiss on the forehead? Is that good enough? Or... How about flicking them? That'll work, too. Just a kiss. It's me? Jihu. Can you love anyone other than Seohyeong? It's been a long time since we've kissed. What? That's not such a hard question! Don't come near me! Go away! Is it my turn? Yeah. Junpyo. If someone that you love is hurt by you... Can you let her go? No. I wouldn't. I couldn't. I would make her happy and never let her go. Is it my turn? Jandi. Is the promise that you made to me still valid? Tell me that you'll never run away from me. I promise. I'll promise that your mother will never break us apart. No. Both the person who made the promise and the peson who heard it... Are gone. My turn? Wubin. Me? If the F4 members were girls, who would you want to marry? What? I'm really curious. Who would it be? I don't want to marry any of them. Junpyo cares about himself. Jihu is erratic. And Jiyeong is a cold womanizer. I'd rather be a monk. What did you say? I care about myself? I'm erratic? I'm a cold womanizer? Hey! I had no other choice! Jihu, kiss him. Get away from me! Don't come near me! Happy now? I'm leaving. Wait. What now? I want to play the game. What? Truth or dare. I only have one question. Will you answer it? The game's long over. If you had to choose... Between love and friendship, which would you choose? Both. I'm never one to give up. Go inside and get some sleep. Fool. What do you want me to do... With such a perfect answer? The ground is shaking. Huh? I feel it, too. Think it's an earthquake? We're not in Japan. Earthquake? I'm glad you're home. Pack your things and leave. This house is being demolished. Demolished? Out of the blue? We don't know the details. Just pack your things. We were ordered to tear down the house today. By whom? How are we supposed to know that? Hurry up and pack your things. You secretly call someone over who's already engaged. And you didn't do anything wrong? Sis. What are we going to do? Evertyhing's okay. Don't worry. If she's your type, want me to lend her to you? Yijeong! Thanks for today. - Good job. - Get home safe. You're working very hard. I want to properly finish it. I'll be going now. - So long. - Bye. Huh? What's that? It's very unique. I made it when I was younger. Oh. It has an inscription. It's very pretty. Do you like it? Yes. Can you lend it to me for a few days? I want to make something like it. It's not that hard to make. It's very important to me, so don't break it. Okay. It's so pretty. See you tomorrow. Bye. You're using your wrist too much. Yijeong. Do you envy me, sis? I'll be able to have fresh seafood starting tomorrow. That's not fair. You get to eat lots of food and spend time with mom and dad. You're so lucky. Should I come with you? That isn't possible. You have to graduate high school and go to medical school. You can't go home with me. Will you be okay? Don't worry. I'll take good care of mom and dad. See you! Sis, don't forget to eat some rice for breakfast. Rice! I think Junpyo still likes you. I think he still likes you. I'm always on your side. Good luck! I can't carry her. Jandi! Sorry I pronounced that wrong. Man! I have to get going. Do what? I didn't want to eat it. Can I just eat it?
