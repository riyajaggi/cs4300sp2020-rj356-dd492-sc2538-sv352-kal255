 Boys Over Flowers (2009): Season 1, Episode 3 - Episode #1.3 - full transcript 
 Jealous of seeing Ji Hoo with Jan Di, Joon Pyo absents himself from Seo Hyun's party to the swimming pool area where his fear of insects lands him in the drink. Jan Di, being a swimmer, rescues him, but to her further disgust Joon Pyo looks upon her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as having taken her first kiss. Happy now, he continues to pursue her. Meanwhile, Seo Hyun's party is a set-up to announce her permanent departure from South Korea, leaving Ji Hoo depressed. Also, Hee Soo (Joon Pyo's domineering mother) returns to host an auction and casts a disapproving eye on Jan Di.

 Episode 3 It's not right for a gentleman to ignore such a pretty girl. I must be dreaming. I feel as if my feet are floating in thin air. I wish she'd get off my shoes. She looks like a totally different person. Seohyeon can do wonders. Maybe I should ask Jandi to be my date to the exhibition. What's that? Help! He's drowning!

 Gu Junpyo is drowning in the pool! Hurry, hurry! What's all the fuss? - He can't swim. - What? Swimming is the one thing Junpyo can't to do. Junpyo! Come on! Open your eyes! Breathe, Junpyo! Hey! Gu Junpyo! Hey, wake up! Huh? You're really something! You're a total fraud!

 I'm sorry, sir. I'll get you a new cup. Please forgive me. What? Have you caught a cold? Shall I call Dr. Kim? Not at all. I feel great. Get the car ready. I should be getting to school. So early in the morning? Students should go to school early. As they say, "The early bird catches the worm." I'll fire the maid right away. Why's that? Huh? I think you're being too sensitive. Take it easy. The weather is great! What's this? Junpyo! When I get my hands on him, he's dead. He's been like that all day. I've never seen him so focused before. But why does he have to pester the transfer student? Besides, Jandi saved his life. I guess he's taking her gratitude for granted. This is a way for me to thank her. Or else, I wouldn't be paying any attention to her. Most people aren't grateful for this type of attention. Be quiet! Are you trying to take Jihu's place? Where the heck is he anyway? He's been depressed ever since the trip. It must be a lover's quarrel. Seohyeon is out of his league. What a dork! If he likes her, he can just be forthcoming. Let me just do this. First it's Junpyo, and now, Jihu? She's digging her own grave. Oh, my gosh. Just look at that. She's the type that stops at nothing. What are we going to do with her? Property of Geum Jandi Do you know what time it is? You shouldn't be skipping your swimming practice. I'm going to kick you off the team. I think they've been dating for a while now. Jihu wasn't defending Jandi for nothing. Your friendship with him will be broken because of Jandi. Do you get it now? Jandi may look innocent, but she's a real gold digger. Shut up! If you utter one more word, I'll wring your neck. It was brand new. Were you expecting someone else? What are you doing here? Why not? Aren't I allowed to be here? Does this space belong to the two of you? Where are you going? I'm going home. I have nothing to say to you. Well I do! - What are you doing? - I have something to say. Let me go. How dare you? How dare you ridicule me? What are you talking about? Let go of me. I tried to be nice. Do I seem easy? Well you know what? I don't just pay people back. It just doesn't satisfy me. What are you doing? Don't! No, no! You hated it that much? Geum Jandi. Aren't you going to school? - No! - Do I have to spank you? I'd rather be spanked. Go ahead. Huh? Stop it. I can't go! I won't! I'd rather swim in an icy river! I'm not going back to that crazy school! If you want to see me die, you can force me to go! - Hey. - lsn't it a holiday today? Some guy said this was for you. What is it? What? Party lnvitation A party? A party? Jandi is finally making her debut as a socialite? Honey, honey! Let me see it! Let's help Jandi out here. Honey, a dress! A dress! Honey, take this. I'm sorry, Jandi. I'm so incompetent that I'm unable to buy you a dress. We live in a poor neighborhood. None of our customers have any nice dresses. Oh, traditional Korean hanbok is nice. What do you say? It's not a wedding she's attending. It's a garden party. Shouldn't the knight in shining armor take Jandi out shopping? Hello. This is a delivery to Geum Jandi from Min Seohyeon. Min Seohyeon? Oh! Is this right? Pull it down. Why didn't you invite me to your exhibition? You said you'd call us. That's what you said to me, too. Who are you with today? If you don't have a partner, let me be your date. Hey, stop it. I had my eyes on him first. - Don't touch Yijeong. - Don't be silly. Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Honey, why are you so late? What kept you so long? What are you doing here? Seohyeon invited me. Did you rob a department store? Let me say this much. Jandi is quite pretty when she's all dolled up. Yes, you're the cutest gal here tonight. No way! A leopard can't change its spots. Junpyo! You actually got it right. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Seohyeon Happy birthday to you Thank you for coming to my 23rd birthday party. Thank you for raising me, mom and dad. And I thank my friends for loving me, despite all my faults. In addition to my words of gratitude, I'd like to share some news with you. I usually don't hold such lavish birthday parties. Where is Jihu? Is she going to announce an engagement? I'll be going back to Paris next week, and I won't be coming back. I've already quit modeling. What is she saying? Thanks to my parents, I was able to achieve a great deal without working hard at all, but I'd rather start anew where I'm just known for my own self. I won't be inheriting my parent's law firm. What I want in life is to share what little I have. I had to hold a big party in order to make you understand. I wish you happiness. Seohyeon is leaving with a bang. Does Jihu know about this? Now I understand why he's been so depressed. Seohyeon is just so cool. But what about Jihu? Hi. You still have it. Remember the first summer we were apart? So you remember. That was when you stopped treating me like a sister. What was I to you? I guess you're really upset. I feel abandoned. If there's one person I can't abandon, it's you. Don't lie to me. If I were lying, I wouldn't care that you like Jandi. What do you mean? When you rushed to Jandi, I felt my heart sink. Isn't it funny? I'm not in the mood to kid around. But I'm rather pleased. You've grown into a real man. Don't be silly! You get what you want no matter what. You had it so that I could never get too close, or too far. I was just a toy. I'd cry all night long. What are you talking about? I've been faithful to you for 1 5 years. There's nothing more I'd like than to have you in my arms. I'm a man! I know. I'm sorry, Jihu. I'm really sorry. It'll be embarrassing if you faint right now. It would be out of character. I'm not going to faint. Jandi, you're here. Why didn't you come in? It's just that... I was on my way to thank you. I'm sorry about the party. We were about to go for a drive. Want to join us? What? No. We have somewhere else to go. - You do? - Yeah. I'm taking her out for a drive. A drive! That's it. Seohyeon, goodbye. See you again. Let's go. I've paid off my dues. What dues? For saving me in the pool. I saved your life. This isn't good enough! Shall we go back inside? Let's say that you paid 1 0% of your dues. 50%. 25%. It's nice. Why aren't there any customers? I kicked them out. Why? I bought the place out until morning, so do what you want. Like what? You can cry or scream. If you need a punching bag, I can call my bodyguard. Why would I want to do that? I thought you had a heart attack when you saw Jihu and Seohyeon. No way! I'm no match for someone like Seohyeon. I'm not pretty or smart. Nor am I from a great family. And you have a terrible personality. That's right. I'm really nothing! I was never eligible from the start. It's true that you're nothing much, but you're not nothing. You're eligible. Huh? If Jihu had met you first, instead of Seohyeon, he would've liked you for sure. Are you being honest? You're not pretty or smart. But you're the first girl I've recognized. That makes you eligible. I need to use the bathroom. Isn't it hot? I'm thirsty, too. Water... What a joke! Hey, Ms. Laundry! Get up. What's wrong with her? Over there... - She drank it all? - Yes. Hey girl, come to your senses! Girl? Yes, I'm a girl. Just a girl who's nothing special? You said I wasn't pretty or smart. Well, you're right. You didn't really have to point that out for me. I already know it all. You dork! Dork? No, no. I don't have time to be concerned about this. I happen to be a very busy person. I have to attend a school where I'm picked on. I work a part-time job because of my trouble-making dad. In addition, I have to keep up my swimming for my scholarship. I don't have time to get involved in your love affairs. You're drunk. Hey, gangster! Get up. Hey! I'm feeling sad today. I'm sad. Junpyo, you're so awful! Fine, I'll go easy on you. 50%? I'll cut your debt in half. In half! Thanks for saving me, Junpyo. There's nothing I can do in return. Shoot! Oh, shoot! Benefit Auction for Refugees That bread smells really delicious! You have a keen nose. What happened? What am I doing here? I brought you here. I'm asking you why I'm at your house and not mine! Don't you remember? The world-class fashion designer, Yoshiguchi Kenzi of Ermeraldo released it as part of his spring/summer collection. The suit flew in from Milan two days ago. The price? Forget it. I don't want her to pass out. I'm not in the mood to hear about your clothes! I wore it yesterday. I don't care what you wore! It was my first and last time wearing it, thanks to someone. Shoot! Do you remember now? Do you expect me to have brought you to your house like that? Sorry. I called your parents. My secretary says your parents didn't seem worried. I should get going. Sorry for all the trouble. Stop putting on an act. - Master. - What is it? - Your mother... - What about her? She's arrived. Already? How did she get here so fast? Where's Junpyo? He's on the second floor. Make sure he doesn't leave the house. Yes, ma'am. Come with me. Why? - It's an emergency! - What? The witch has returned. I'm in my room with Ms. Laundry, but there's no way out. What? Junpyo, if you get caught... It's over. If she ever found out you had a girl in your room, I wonder what her reaction would be. I bet you a thousand bucks that Junpyo would be sent to Alaska. I bet 3,000 bucks he'd be sent to the South Pole. She'd probably hire a hit man. Really? Is she really that scary? Do you remember the time you ran away from day camp? How could we forget? We nearly died that day. Don't move! Bonjour. Hey. Are you Yijeong? You look great. I've heard people calling you the great beauty of Korea. - So tell me... - Huh? What's your favor? This is exactly why I like you so much. City Hall has asked for you to sponsor their project. Reject it. The educational ministry asks Shinhwa to support students from the country. Reject it. Is Junpyo in his room? Yes. Hello. Who are you? Hello. She's my guest, so don't be concerned. If she's in this house, she's my guest, too. Don't you think so? She's a friend. A friend? Yes, we go to the same school. She's our mascot. She's a year younger than us. Something like that. Tell me about your family. I... What does your father do? - My father... - He runs a business. Really? What kind? Clothing-related. Fashion, I mean. He's quite famous in the industry. That's interesting. Are you interested in today's auction? Yes, she'll be very much interested in the Vera Song dress tonight. She's sure to help inflate the bid on the dress. Your mother must have very refined tastes. What line of work is she in? Ma'am, it's time to greet the guests. Junpyo, come down with me. It's for a good cause. All of you can help out. Okay. You can't lie like this. What if she finds out? I should've told her the truth. About your dad's dry cleaning service? If you told her the truth, your family might be in danger. I'm serious when I say you'd be eaten alive. You must take after your mom. Today's first item will certainly catch your attention. Here it is now. Please pay close attention. Let's start the auction off with Park Taehwan's goggles. Park Taehwan's goggles? I'll start with $500. $1,000. I have bid for $1,000. $2,000. Yes, that's $2,000. $7,000. That's $7,000.

The next item is a real beauty. - I can't do it. - I invite you to... the world of Vera Song. The pastel yellow is sure to show off your figure. The golden spangles and beads make the dress even more elegant. The Vera Song dress will start at $1 0,000. Yes, I have $1 0,000. Anyone else? $1 5,000. - Yes, someone has bid $1 5,000. - How is Junpyo these days? He's been pretty quiet. He's doing well at school. Do you know that female student? You can transform yourself in this yellow Vera Song dress. I finally get to meet Wonder Girl. Nice to meet you. I didn't push him. It's the truth. Mr. Jeong. Yes? I know that she attends Shinhwa High. Do a background check on her. Yes, ma'am. The Vera Song dress is sure to be of high quality. It was very popular in Paris this season. Really? These are the goggles worn by Park Taehwan? I can't believe this! Jandi, it's amazing! It's unbelieveable! - What? - Park Taehwan's goggles! They are worth $2,000. $2,000? For a pair of goggles? Sell them now. That's a great deal of money! No! Do you know how much these are worth? What I mean is, you can't put a price tag on something like these. Sell them! They're $2,000. I'd sell them for $20. What are you talking about? Let's see. I don't want to sell them. I don't know. Good night. - Jandi! - Young lady! Catch her! Hey! I'm leaving. Anyway, thanks. What? I couldn't hear you. - I said, "Thanks." - What? Thanks! You should've left out the "anyway" part. You have such a high sense of pride for a commoner. You heard everything. - I take it back! - What? I take back thanking you. You don't ever change, do you? I'm leaving. Hey, Laundry! What? Don't drink alcohol when I'm not around. Seohyeon! What are you doing here? I came to quit school. I wanted to see you one last time. I'm glad you're here. Quit school? You won't be coming back? Nope. When are you leaving? Tomorrow. That soon? I haven't thanked you yet. I haven't paid you back for everything you did. If you keep saying that, I'm going to be mad. I knew it from the start. Jihu always smiles when he's talking to you. Seohyeon. Jandi, what is it? I was a fan before I even met you. So I know why you've made your decision. But... I'm begging you. Please don't leave. Get up. I know that I have no right to ask you this, but if I don't ask you... Is it because of Jihu? I don't know anything about Jihu. But... I know that... He treasures you with all his heart. He looks so sad in my eyes. He only smiles seldomly. His smile can melt your heart. You're the only person who can make him smile. If you leave like this, he'll never be able to smile again. Please get up. Jandi, when it comes to making a decision, it's the same as buying something in another country. If you don't take action right away, it'll be gone the next day. And I know what that's like. Jihu is an important person to me. And I'm sure he feels the same way about me. I don't think he would want me to have any regrets. What do you think? I'm sorry. Sorry. Don't say that. I'm really glad you were honest with me. Thank you. Seohyeon... Wait. For me? Remember what I said? Shoes are very important. I hope they'll take you to great places. I have a favor to ask of you as well. About Jihu. Make him smile again. Who do you think you are? Why'd you have to do that? Who asked you to talk to her? You were begging. Don't you have any pride? This isn't about pride. Because you're so miserable. You were so sad. Who cares? It's none of your business. Go away. What does it mean to be a man? A man who is totally responsible. Jandi. You and l... No way! Mother and father, I've sinned. So he's the heir to the Shinhwa Group? It's the next flight. I'm glad I got to know you. Dating is the only thing we can do. Marriage is arranged by our parents. Don't you remember? And you call yourselves men? Is it true with you and Junpyo? If you've lied to Junpyo, you've lied to us. Jandi, I don't know who you are anymore.
