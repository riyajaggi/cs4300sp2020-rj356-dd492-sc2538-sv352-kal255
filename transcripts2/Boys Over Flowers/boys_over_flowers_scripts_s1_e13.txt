 He doesn't keep in touch with his F4 friends? I think he's being careful. And everyone else is busy. So he's become quite busy now that he's in college. It's a no-brainer. I bet he's enjoying the company of all his new girlfriends. What are you doing? Don't say that. I've been to the Blue House before. Hey, the chef is sleeping! The restaurant is not being managed properly. The old man is back again. Mister, what would you like today? Royal soup. Royal soup?

 What's that? You're being really unfair. Mister, this is a porridge shop we're running here. You've ordered food that's not even on the menu. Fish soup, dried mackerel, and what else? Tang... What was it called? Oh! Both of you are just as ignorant as your boss. It's called "tangpyeongchae"! Oh, right. Stop talking back to me. Just bring me my food! Mister, was it tasty? Tasty, my foot! I just don't like throwing food away. I was doing my best to force myself to eat it. I thought you were going to eat the bowl, too. Tell the chef that the bowl is too nice for the food. He's not just the chef. He's our boss. He's no boss at all. Mister. Yes? It's raining outside. Do you have an umbrella? You can return it to us next time. Every time I see you, you remind me of a lotus flower. A lotus flower? Do you know why lotuses bloom in the mud? - What? - It's your homework to find out. Goodbye. Jandi. Yes? Listen carefully. What? He's not one to waste his breath. Got it? What do you mean? Tell me what's going on. I'm really confused. Huh? Special Series: Chef to the President Sis. Doesn't he look exactly like Junpyo? Look at his curly hair and his lips. Not at all. Junpyo isn't as cute and nice as that doll. The doll would be mad to hear that. Of course not. Junpyo is more like a tiger. - Right? - Ouch. Sis, is your shoulder acting up again? No, it's fine. My shoulder hurts as well. It's because I'm always bending down like this. It really hurts. At least Jandi swims. Honey, we'll give you a massage. Gangsan, come on! Okay! Here. Gangsan, go easy on me. Not so hard. That hurts, Gangsan. Hey, dork. You should call me. It's not like you've gone to the moon. Just you wait. You're dead. I'll be back soon. Wait for me. I love you, Jandi. Hello? Yes, that's right. Really? Really? Mom! Dad! Why are you yelling this late at night? Did Junpyo call you? Dad got a job. - Oh! - What? Take the phone call. Hello? This is llbong. Yes, thank you. I'll be there tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. Yes, sir. I'll be there. Yes, sir. Thank you. Be discreet, so they don't know I'm behind this. Kang Huisu has become the new president of the Shinhwa Group. She's doing her best to turn the crisis into new opportunities. A new project is in the works. Good job. Oh, my! Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. See you. Honey. Why are you in a daze? - Honey. - Have you seen a ghost? Pinch me. I just saw a living statue. Haven't you seen a doctor yet? I did. I went to the doctor. I'm perfectly fine. What are you doing? You can talk. About what? What you want to tell Junpyo. Someone will be going to see Junpyo. We haven't been in touch with him since the funeral. He'll get our message for sure. Jihu, it's just so sudden. I don't have much to say. Let's begin. I can't do this. Junpyo. Can you hear me? I've been thinking about us ever since you left. All I remember is our arguments. But it's strange. The memories I have of you are mostly about our fights, but I still smile when I think of you. Gu... Gu Junpyo. How are you? When are you coming back to continue our fights? Do I look hot? You know what? Every woman who sees me work falls for me. I didn't fall for you. I came here to tell you something. Is it about Junpyo and Jandi? Yes. Tell me. What? Are you still firm in your belief? Are you still looking for your one great love? It doesn't matter. Do you think Junpyo is the one true love of Jandi's life? Maybe Junpyo is Jandi's soulmate. Well... You're just trying to project your feelings onto Jandi. What? If I were you, I'd rather look for my own love. Of course... I'm not sure true love exists. It was a mistake to come here. I'll be going now. I know you believe in it. You believe true love only comes once in a lifetime. You have to believe in it. What? Sometimes, a strong denial suggests the opposite meaning. I think I understand now. You really believe in true love. You're afraid because it actually exists. Why's that? Don't put words in my mouth. Today's the first time you actually seem human. I'm glad I came here after all. Let's talk about Jandi next time. Bye. Enjoy your meal. Hey! The appearance of food is important. Just look at the color. It looks tasty to me. You can try some. Really? It's delicious! Did you do your homework? - Homework? - Yes. I have a phone call. Jihu? Now? Wait a second. I'll be right back. Jihu. What a waste of time. Excuse me. What? What shall I make for you next time? Next time? The dish you're most confident about. Something your dad would be proud of. Okay! What's going on? You have to come with me. Where? You'll find out soon. Your shoulder injury is quite severe. Why didn't you get treated right away? It's still not too late. Your life won't be at risk. But no more swimming. I know. I'm not pretty. I'm not smart. I don't have much money. But... There's just one thing... I enjoy doing. Something I can do better than others. I can't swim anymore. The doctor said I shouldn't ever swim again. What am I going to do now? What else can I do? You can find something new. You have your music. Jeong has his pottery. Junpyo and Wubin will inherit their family businesses. Everyone is going down their given path. But I don't know what I'll be doing. I'll help. I'll help you. Let's look for it together. Have a seat. I caused the accident. What? I remember it vaguely. I was fooling around in the back seat. I covered my dad's eyes. My parents were holding me. Everyone called it a miracle. My grandfather never returned to this house. I guess he hated me for killing his son. That's when she held out her hand and told me to start anew. I think that... It's my turn now. What are you doing? Is this the best you can do? Go after her. If she isn't here with you, you should run after her. Love isn't about waiting for that special someone. You don't even have a right to say you love her. Gaeul, this a new dish I made. What do you think? I don't know. I hope it turns out well. It looks delicious. Excuse me. Can you give me an advance? What? An advance. Jandi, did your dad get into trouble again? No. I need some money. How much? 2,000 dollars. $2,000? For what? I want to buy a plane ticket. A plane ticket? Don't tell me.... Jandi, take a look at my skin. Having great skin is important for a pretty boy like me. I've been so stressed lately that I have skin problems. I really want to give you an advance. But I'm worried about my new porridge. It's so sweet. For each bowl I sell, I get 50 cents? Yes. - For every 1 00 sold? - $50. 1,000 bowls? 500 dollars. Great! Hey, girls. Here. Have fun. Doing what? Have fun selling porridge! Good luck! Same to you! We'll take care of your breakfast! Get your hearty warm porridge! Try some warm and nutritious porridge! Sample some of this. Do you think you'd be able to sell them all today? Try some porridge! Porridge in the morning is good for you. Get your nutritious porridge! It's cold. Here! Have some porridge! Buy one, get one free. We have some warm porridge! It's a very healthy meal. Try some warm porridge. Are you sure it's healthy? Sure. Please come inside. Come inside. We have some warm porridge waiting for you. Thank you. I'm sure... You'll like it. Good job. Is Jandi in charge of the money? I didn't know we'd end up selling so much. I didn't do it on my own. Are you sure I can accept it? You can accept it. It was fun for all of us. But what are you doing here so suddenly? You're coming with us. Swimmer, in place. Ready. Go! Now... Now starts Jandi's retirement ceremony. First, she'll be presented with a prize. The prize. For Shinhwa High School's Geum Jandi. This person has shown great perseverance. As the only swimming athlete at the elite institution, Shinhwa, she has tamed Junpyo and F4 with unparalleled techniques. This prize is presented to award her efforts. From F4 in Korea. Jandi. It's a new beginning. I hope you know that. You can go to Macau and give Junpyo a piece of your mind. Thank you. Jandi. Have a nice trip. I'll be back! Macau Airport $100 to Macau. Okay? - One hundred? - Yes? Taxi? One hundred is very cheap. Macao, yes? Okay? Wait, wait. That converts to $1 9.70. I'm sorry. Thank you! It's too expensive. I can't pay $1 9 for a cab. Bus, bus! Bus, wait! Bus, bus, wait! Thank you. All of this belongs to Junpyo? I'm just starting to realize how much wealth Shinhwa has. Where's the entrance? Junpyo, Junpyo! I've come to meet Gu Junpyo. Meet Junpyo. Gu Junpyo. Gu Junpyo. You can ask him yourself. Okay. I'm leaving. Junpyo. How much? Okay. Thank you. It's delicious. Can I try this one? My dad would love it. So how much is it? How much? Give her back the wallet. Wallet? That's my wallet. My wallet. My wallet! He's a thief. Are you Korean? Thank you. Wait a second! Fine. Let her go. You're making the situation worse. You started out a thief, but now you've taken someone hostage. Go away! I can't get through to him. You had your chance. Don't hate me later. On the count of three, bite his arm really hard. What? Don't you know Korean? I am Korean. One, two... Wait! What? Do I bite after three, or on three? You're really funny. - One, two, three. Now! - Huh? - Your wallet. - Thank you. Let's get out of here. I don't want to be in trouble. I don't know how to thank you. I guess it's nice to meet a fellow Korean abroad. Is this your first time abroad? It's my first time alone. Why are you in Macau? I'm looking for someone. Your boyfriend? Yes. Your so lucky. It's nothing to be envious about. Oh! Want to buy some beef jerkey? Come with me. Huh? Me? $1 0 for one slice? I'll buy ten slices for $70. No! I won't buy them, then. Fine, $70. I got a $30 discount by buying both of ours. See? I can always get a discount. It was nice to meet you. Stay safe. Nice to meet you, too. What's your name? Me? I'm Ha Jaegyeong. Ha Jaegyeong. My name is Geum Jandi! Is this a hotel or a cathedral? I'm okay. Sorry. He didn't see me. Maybe he didn't think it was me. I guess it's strange to show up in Macau all of a sudden. It's really strange of me. It's just really strange. Strange, strange. Are you okay, sir? What? Jandi was just here. When are the people from the JK Group coming? If things go wrong, my mother may kill me. So be prepared. Hi. Cheap hotel. You have a cheap room? Yes. It's okay. I can carry it. It's okay. I can carry it. Hey, hey! Hey! Stop right there! If I catch you, you're dead. Hey! Hey, stop right there! Give me back my bag! I have a brother your age. So I'll go easy on you. Give my bag back. How dare you point your finger. Want to die? Give it back. This isn't fair. What's going on? I think we can get $3,000 for her. If you listen to us, we'll take you to a nice place. Help me. Help me, Junpyo! Do you know the llshim clan? - Are you Prince Song? - Yeah. I'm sorry. Please forgive us. Get out of here. What happened? I knew this would happen. We knew you'd end up crying. Junpyo seems to be really busy. He couldn't meet us because of his tight schedule. Maybe he's just grown up. His father passed away. Maybe he had no choice but to grow up. It feels really lonely. Why? He's the owner of a large company and no longer part of F4. Jandi, have you met Junpyo? What? Not yet. How could I meet him when he's so busy? How'd you know he's busy? It's just a hunch. He has to be responsible for such a big resort. We'll see him soon enough. Do you want to look around while we wait? Okay. Let's go. Come on! Mr. Kim will hand in the rest of the reports. Show me when it's ready. Yes, sir. You should meet you F4 friends. I'm not free. Should I hang out with them instead? He's become really strange. I came here to hear what Junpyo has to say. I'll face him. So you did it on purpose? This is who I really am. I was just pretending before. Hey, ugly lady. Buy some ice cream. Spend today with me. Jihu likes that girl. What? Jihu smiles every time he sees her. Get on my back. What? I get to try new things because of you. So thank you.
