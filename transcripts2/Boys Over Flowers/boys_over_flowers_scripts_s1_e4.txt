 Boys Over Flowers (2009): Season 1, Episode 4 - Episode #1.4 - full transcript 
 With Seo Hyun leaving Korea for good, Ji Hoo decides to follow her. Joon Pye's outing with Jan Di turns more serious than expected when, after standing hours in the snow waiting for her, they get locked outside on an observation tower in winter's cold where he develops a high fever, forcing Jan Di to watch over him through the night. Word gets out of their "night together," and the school student body, believing Jan Di is now Jon Pye's official girlfriend, becomes remarkably kind and attentive towards her - all but the Mean Girls Trio and, surprisingly, school chum Min Ji, who harbors a secret crush on Joon Pye and plots Jan Di's downfall.

Did anyone ask you to do that kind of favor? That isn't even a favor. It's groveling. Don't you have any pride? It's not because I don't have any pride. It's because Senior is in so much pain. Because you were about to die from sadness. What does it matter to you?

 It has nothing to do with you. Get lost. Episode 4 The energy around you is just so dark. What use is it even if F4 emit light by ourselves? There really is no other black hole than you. Gu Jun Pyo. Can I ask you something? Are you not going to ask if I tell you not to ask? Just act like you usually do. It doesn't suit you. Would suppressing your emotions and not expressing them for the sake of the person you like be doing the right thing? Right thing, my foot! - Huh? - What is that?

 Then that's being a complete stranger. How is that liking someone? If the world goes into pieces tomorrow, then you'd probably die first because of regret. Gu Jun Pyo. What? You might not be completely stupid. Did you know that just now? It's better to regret after you act, instead of regretting after you don't do anything. That's my philosophy. It looks like Ji Hoo isn't going to show up till the very end. Be well, everyone. And don't cause any trouble. Goodbye. We'll visit. Don't come visit. Come to have an exhibition. Take care of yourself. Being too kind is your disease. If you treat someone too well, the scars run deeper, Casanova. Must you do that lawyer or NGO crap, Noona? I really can't understand women. Do you know it's been 10 years since you've sincerely called me Noona? Anyway, it's the truth that it's pretty cool, so I decided to accept you as a Noona. Are you complaining? Jan Di. Please don't forget my favor. Please take care of yourself. Be well, everyone. I'm going. Go. Take care of yourself. Ruthless bastard. How can he not come to the very end? What did I tell you? You guys tell me that I have the cruelest personality, but I told you that the real cruel one is Ji Hoo. He looks so serene, but once he turns his back, he's the scariest. Isn't the talking behind my back a little too harsh? - You... - What is this? - Since when were you there? - Since three hours ago. What? So you were here before us... and you didn't even come out for a peek? What are you doing right now? Was Senior someone who was only this good? Chase after her! If she can't stay next to you, then Senior can go next to her. You said that you liked her. Is Senior's love only looking out from a pillar from behind? Do you still have the right to say that you love her? It's for the next plane. I already sent off my luggage. Yoon Ji Hoo. Rascal, he has a skill for surprising people. How did you suddenly get the heart to do that? Thanks to this little lady. What? What? Rascal. Come here, come here. Cute rascal! Thanks. I came to realize it thanks to you. That I have to come into contact with her earnestly. You taught me possibly to have the courage to hang on to her. It's a relief that I got to know a child like you. I'm going. Geum Jan Di. What? What are you going to do now? Listen to my words very carefully. I'm only going to say this once, so listen very carefully. Geum Jan Di. You and I... What did he say? Aren't you getting in? Saturday at 4 o'clock. In front of Nam San Tower. If you're late one minute, you're dead. We must get it at all costs. Come quickly! As soon as it opens at 4 o'clock, run for this. And if you find something that you think it'll fit, just stuff it in the cart. Wouldn't it be better if we just go together? Mom needs to go to the cabbage blowout sale. If the clothes shop were the civil war, this cabbage shop is World War II. Right. You know, the lady who was standing next to me last time. Her teeth were out too. Really? Three months worth of our shop profits are in our hands. Got it? Aja! It's snowing. Hey, Dad must be waiting for us. Let's go home quickly. Saturday at 4 o'clock. In front of Nam San Tower. No way... no, no. That can't be. What are you murmuring about? Mom, there's no way someone would wait outside in the snow for four hours when I didn't say that I'd go, right? How can someone do that unless they're crazy? Let's go. Hold on. Crazy guy... Mom, hold this. Mom, go on first. Jan Di! Where are you going? I'm going somewhere! That girl! Do you know what time it is? That's what I'm supposed to ask. Do you know what time it is? Do you really have nothing else to do? Didn't I say that you'd be dead if you were late? Did I say that I'd come? You're here now. That's because! I was thinking that maybe there'd be a chance that you'd be waiting. So what would have happened if I didn't come by? But anyways, you came! And whose fault is it that I went through all this? What did you do so good that you're being all huffy? It's cold. Get up. I'll buy you something warm. Steam's coming off from your body. Get up. Quickly. You wanna drink tea? Or do you wanna just go? Here. It's 30, 000 Won coffee. Thug, are you scamming people now too? And I can't drink this kind of crap. Just try it. The coffee taste is excellent. Do you want me to tell you why it's 30, 000 Won coffee? Follow me. Wow. How is it? Wasn't I right? It's just like drinking coffee from a hotel's sky lounge. Would someone even be able to leave a drugstore in your hands because of your poor calculation? What? 36,300 Won. Huh? If you're going to take money, you might as well count in the labor and extra fees. So a wealthy person CAN do those kinds of calculations... I'm just acting like I don't. If I really didn't know, then how would I become a wealthy person? Wow... there are so many stars. Hey, those aren't stars. They're satellites, you stupid girl. Are you an idiot? Are there THAT many satellites? Are you kidding me? They're satellites. I don't want to hear this from you. - What, you idiot? - What, you dumbo? - This clueless girl. - You're even more clueless. Hello? You're at Pork restaurant? Don't budge. I'll be there. - Why is it like this? - What is it? Why is it dark? Ahjussi! Ahjussi! There's someone here! Hey, hey, hey. What is it? - The door's locked! - Really? It's really locked? Ahjussi! Stop being so tacky by being so panicked. I can call someone, so just stay still. I really need to go! I'll be killed by my mom! Where's my cell phone? You don't have a phone? What about you? I don't have a phone to begin with. What kind of girl doesn't even have a cell phone? We're locked inside because of you. How is that because of me? If it was cold, you should've went into some place warm. Are you a statue or something? I was pissed off. It was the first time in my life that I waited for someone like that. What? What are we going to do? Ahjussi! What are you doing? Should we go in there? It's cold. Hey, move over. I don't want to. Sorry. What? I told you I'm sorry. In the end, it became like this because of me. At least you know your place. So what? Why is a plutocrat like that? You were standing outside in the cold for four hours. Nobody at your house said anything? Your advisor, your bodyguards, your chauffeur... What did all those people do? - I sent them all away. - Why? I wanted to match the level of a commoner. You really are trying things way too hard. Hey, grass patch. What? Can I be honest with you? Honest with what? What is this? Hey... Tell me from over there. Right now, I think I might be... This guy. He does this every chance he gets. Pervert. Do you really want to be like this in this kind of situation? Get off of me. Hey, get up. If you don't get up in three seconds, I don't know what I'll do to you. One. Two. Two and one eighth. Two. Three! Three! Three! This rascal, really... Hey. Why is he burning up? Hey. Are you okay? I'm sick. Sick? Yeah, you're burning up this much. It'd be strange for you not to be sick. It's cold. You're cold? What are you doing? My mom told me that if you wrap your head like this, you'll get warm. Get on. I'll take you home. It's fine. I need to think of excuses for my mom. I'll walk and then ride the bus. Should I teach you? Your excuses? Hey! I'm sorry! I won't ever do it again! Mother, Father, - I've committed a deadly sin. - One, two, three! Deadly sin? What kind of person did you save? A person who's going to inherit Shinhwa Group. And what kind of group is Shinhwa? Korea's greatest company. Then saving the inheritor of Shinhwa Group is the same as saving Korea's economy. How is that a deadly sin? It won't be enough even if we give you an order. So instead of order, we got this! Doesn't this suit me well? What is all this? And how did you know? What do you mean, how did I know? Young Master. Hold on. What was Young Master's name? Jun Pyo. Gu Jun Pyo. - Gu Jun Pyo - I know, I know. Young Master Jun Pyo sent us all this. He told me to not scold you too much because you were with him all night. He sent us all this as a repayment of debt. Because he's the Young Master of the best plutocrat, he was so well-mannered. He said that next time, he would come himself to say hello. But it was so motivational, that tears just... Mom, don't cry. Honey, how can you cry on such a happy day? Since I was with you for one whole night, tell them that I'd take responsibility of you. Hey! They say that Geum Jan Di and Gu Jun Pyo are going out! They say Geum Jan Di's boyfriend is Senior Gu Jun Pyo! Geum Jan Di has been enthroned as Gu Jun Pyo's girlfriend. Commoner Jan Di has ascended in identity. Enthroned as Gu Jun Pyo's girlfriend. They say Geum Jan Di has been enthroned as Gu Jun Pyo's new girlfriend! Jan Di! Hi! You look pretty today. Geum Jan Di. Hi! Jan Di. Hi! Glad to see you! Jan Di! Good morning! Good morning. Jan Di! Jan Di, do you want to go shopping with us today? Geum Jan Di, you have to come to my birthday party this weekend. Here, drink this. Thanks. Thanks. Bye! Bye! Geum Jan Di. She has. Bad intentions. Jun Pyo, is this for real? No! It's not! It certainly isn't what you guys are thinking about. - This, you see... - Yeah. It's real. No! No! No! I wandered today to the hill, Maggie. To watch the scene below {\a6}(Gum Jan Di means green grass) {\a6}The creek and the creaking old mill, Maggie. Where we sat long, long ago. Are you okay? Yeah. I was a little dizzy. I'm fine now. That's a relief. Nobody knows that I came to visit you, so you don't have to worry. Jan Di. Yeah? Is it true about F4's Gu Jun Pyo? No. It's because we bumped into each other accidentally. It's simply an accident. But it seemed like he really liked you. Hey! That doesn't make any sense. He's just playing around and teasing with me. How can Gu Jun Pyo... Don't you know after you got abused by him before? The invincible Gu Jun Pyo liking ME? That... that is true. Yeah. Are you going somewhere? Yeah. I think I'm all better now. Jan Di. Should we go somewhere and play? Just wait a little. Shinhwa Kindergarten? NO! Why are you touching other people's stuff? What do you think you're doing? Sorry... I... I wrote weird things in here so I don't want anyone to see it. Sorry I got mad. Sorry I didn't ask for permission. You should change your clothes too. Jun Pyo, Are you being sincere? About what? Geum Jan Di What else is there besides sincerity? Do you even know what sincerity is to us to take it so lightly? Our only freedom is dating. The final decision is made by our parents. You haven't forgotten that right? Were you guys just saying you were men with your mouths? What the heck. So you were boasting when you weren't even real men? What's your definition of a real man? A man who takes responsibility from the beginning to the end To the end? Yeah. To the end. Do you want to dance? Huh? Do you want to dance? It's my first time at a place like this, so I'm just going to watch. Okay. Then just wait here for a second. Ow! I'm sorry. What? Is it unfair? If your face is ugly, then you should at least dance well. With a sad body like that, what makes you think it's okay for you to crawl in here? Acting like that when you're this ugly... Ka Wol, you're not going anywhere right? Where would I go? Don't go! Don't go without me! What star is this nonsense from now? Just go inside and make porridge. Welcom- Doesn't Geum Jan Di work here? Yes. I don't see her. She's not working today. And you are... Jan Di's friend? Since when? Since Kindergarten. Then you're best friends? Let's go. Huh? Where? See? I was right. I'm telling you because I'm afraid Jan Di will get hurt. So I would like you to warn her. That sort of stuff is important for girls. What kind of warning? It's not a tree she can climb so don't even try? Because she's a toy for killing time that you rich sons are going to eventually throw away? Hey, calm down. It's scary to see such a cute lady being angry. Ka Wol. You really are Jan Di's friend, You think that if you make that expression that everyone's going to fall for it, You tried it on the wrong person. I'll pretend I didn't hear anything today. Okay then. It's making me angrier the more I think about it. The person who first pursued is not Jan Di but that guy. Jan Di doesn't have the faintest idea of climbing that tree! Yo. Yi Jung What have you done now? What do you mean? There's only one reason why girls leave here angry. I don't know. She's the type that I hate the most... That kind of subject. What kind of subject is that? There's such a thing. Whether its comedy or melodrama, in the end it's solved with reason. I hate dealing with unsophisticated people. You didn't have to make such effort. Still, it's very important. It shouldn't drop. Sorry about that. It's okay. Isn't it suffocating in here? Thank you. Let's go down after one more song. Thanks for last night. No! No! NO WAY! Why did you want to wear uniforms all of a sudden? Sometimes... it's nice to have a student atmosphere. That hair... will it really straighten out? It's already been two hours. You're not going to do this every morning, are you? A solution will come out eventually. Straighten it out well. Yes. What is it you hate so much about me? What are you not satisfied about me? The way you look, the way you walk, and your stupid curly hair! I hate everything. It's such an eyesore to see you bunch wearing whatever you please to school, and picking on weak kids for fun with your red cards or whatever with your thoughtlessness! That's the worst! Now, let's go! No. It's probably not. No, no. How is that I can't remember anything? Let's be calm. Let's be calm Geum Jan Di. If something did happen, there's no way nothing's happening now. Is there? Or not? Is there? Or not? I'm going crazy. Hey, hey! What are you doing? Let me go. - Let go while I'm still nice. - What are you doing? Are you saying that because your mouth is already torn open? I can't believe this. No matter how ill-bred you are. This is what's scary about people who don't have much. I knew you were the world's greatest skank, but this is a little too much! Hey! Hey! Explain it in a way that I can understand. I didn't do anything to be treated this way. Are you going to let me go? Let go. Let go. Let's go show her. What's the matter? Let go! Let go! Hurry up and go. Let go! You didn't do anything? When you trick Jun Pyo, that's like tricking all of us. If you badmouth F4, that's like badmouthing all of us! How can you, a girl like dirty mop... Did you think we would leave you alone when you were dirtying Shinhwa High? Bad girl! What are you doing? Who do you think you are to bother her? Jun Pyo Senior, don't be tricked! Look at this and snap out of it! No, Gu Jun Pyo. This isn't the truth. This is wrong. What went so wrong that a picture like this was taken? I don't know. I think someone's trying to frame me. You were this much? Were you a girl only worth this much? Even if they were framing you, were you the type of girl to easily fall into this kind of trap? Gu Jun Pyo Even if you believe it or not, it doesn't matter. I don't even know why I'm trying to defend myself in a situation that doesn't make any sense. Either way, this isn't the truth. I... I really don't know anything about this! I'm just going to ask you one thing. The girl in the picture... Geum Jan Di, is that you? You said it didn't matter if I believe it or not. Right? Yeah, you're right. Geum Jan Di, From now on, I don't know who you are. Hey! You slutty insect! Take it off! Take it off! {\a6}("take it off"- uniform as in stop dirtying the school's name) Take this off. Take it off. Take it off. Hey, this is going to far. At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if someone dies. I think this is the first time it's been this bad since Jun Hee's wedding. Let's hurry up. I'm sorry, but I'm not sure. Can you just tell me once? First things first, we should find the guy. You said you met him at a club, right? I went to ask but they said they didn't know him. Then when you opened your eyes that morning, did you see anything in the room? A business card or his belongings. Ah... He wrote a memo on the mirror. "Thanks for last night." In red lipstick. Wait. Lipstick? Yes. Was that yours? No. Then, that means it's his. There's three people. Stop saying nonsense and go away. Wait, it's true. Look. At this angle, there's no way he took the picture. There was a third person in the room that took this picture. Then that's... the lipstick owner. What are you doing? It looks like a smudge but it's not erasing. This! Let's go. Wait, wait. Just leave it to us. Thanks. Yes... With those looks, they must be from Andromeda. That's a little difficult. I heard that guy is the number one here. If we take the Number One, I guess it would hurt you a bit. Thanks for understanding. But... If you don't give him to us, you won't just be getting hurt, you'll get closed. Is that okay? What? It'll take about two weeks, right? We have the F4 reputation. We should finish it off in a week. The building next to here, it's yours right? I can probably start tomorrow. I should loosen up and get some practice It's who? {\a6}For commoner Geum Jan Di, Shinhwa High tomato party will be held in the afternoon today. All are invited!! Jan Di. Jan Di. I have something urgent to tend to, so I'll be going first. Jan Di! Never mind. Bye! One, two three! Don't be so distressed. For Gu Jun Pyo to act like this over a slut... Is unbelievable. Please snap out of it. This isn't it. How can Gu Jun Pyo act like this. This is so unfair! You... Weren't you her friend? Can you say that as her friend? Because she stole you away from me. Please don't go. Move your hand. What's the reason that Geum Jan Di is okay but I'm not? What's the reason why Jan Di is okay! No, Gu Jun Pyo. This isn't the truth. This is wrong. What went so wrong that a picture like this was taken? I don't know. I think someone's trying to frame me. Is this all you've got? Do more! Do more! Attack!
