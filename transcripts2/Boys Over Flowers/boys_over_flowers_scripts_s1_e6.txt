 Episode 6 How'd you do this? I told you already. I can make things happened that you've never imagined. I didn't think you you'd be shocked by such petty things. This isn't petty. If I've touched your heart, let's get to the issue at hand. The issue at hand? What are you doing? Don't take off your clothes. What are you doing?

 Don't take off your clothes. If you do, you're dead! If you take off your pants, you're dead. I told you not to take them off. Hey! What did I just say? Stupid. Come here, stupid. You scared me! Junpyo. Stop right there. Don't move. - Why? - Don't move. What is it? There's a snake under your feet. What?

 Your feet. A snake under your feet. I hate snakes! You run pretty fast! Faster! Hey! Run faster! That's pretty fast. Hey! Ma'am. Your rice drink is ready. Place it over here. Yes, ma'am. Enjoy your drink. Your tip. Thank you, ma'am. Wait a second. Yes, ma'am? If you're free, can you apply this on me? It's what I do best, ma'am. Mom! Huh? The chicken shop owner wants us to order his chicken. What? For the price of a chicken, we could have bowls of chicken soup. I'm taking it down! Honey, what about this? Gangsan. My pretty Gangsan. What did you say? Shall I put some on you? No thanks. You have such smooth skin, baby. Huh? Jandi, Jandi! Come here for a second! Jandi! Stop it! Come on. Hey! Jandi! What's wrong? - Jandi! - What? Jandi! Oh, no. What's wrong? Jandi is acting strange. I think she has a cramp. Jandi! Jandi! Jandi, wake up! Are you feeling better? Ma'am. Where did Junpyo go again? I heard the jet left for New Caledonia at 5:00. Is something wrong? I think he's gone on a weekend trip. Okay. Wait. Did you check the others on the trip? It's his usual group of friends from F4. F4, you say? When is he going to stop playing stupid games? You're dismissed. Help! Mom! Dad! Sis! Help me! Why doesn't Junpyo know how to swim? He was kidnapped at 8 years old. What? He had a male babysitter. He was his bodyguard and driver. And he was the culprit? The car was being chased before it dove into the river. No way! And Junpyo was inside the car. What's going on? I've made a special meal for you. I think it's for a certain someone. Who cares? - It looks delicious. - Come here. Let me go. You're hurting me! Eat evertyhing here. Do I look like Godzilla to you? It's good for your body, so just eat it. You're weak in the legs because you eat strange bugs. Strange bugs? You're a swimmer, yet you almost drowned. It can happen when you get cramps. Cramps or no cramps, I won't allow you to be so weak, so don't complain and start eating, okay? Here. How are you? The pretty girl didn't come with you? Give this to your girlfriend. You want to eat all this? Junpyo doesn't like chubby women. What? The pajamas I put inside your bag will work wonders. Pajamas? He's totally into Jandi right now, but evertyhing may change after tonight. What are you talking about? Men get weak when they're rejected. I think it's worth a shot. Good luck. What the heck are you talking about? Gaeul, don't you like Junpyo? Unbelievable! Excuse me, I have high standards. Why were you sensitive about Jandi and Junpyo? No way. Don't tell me you're in love with Jandi. Jandi is in love with someone else. So Yijeong, come here quick. Hurry! I'm crazy. Show time! Junpyo. You belong on the list of the world's top playboys. What's she doing inside there? I thought you fainted in there! Were you taking a bath? What took you so long? Hey! Does he want to die or what? This is my room, not yours! I know that. So what are you doing here? I wouldn't be here without a reason. So why are you here? Important? As a woman? Junpyo, what are you doing? Cheap things suit you. You came to give me this? Sure. Did you think I was here to get fresh? I don't get fresh with women unless it's mutual. Close the door tight or lizards will make it inside. If you lose my present, you're dead. That jerk! Gaeul, are you asleep? Are you sleeping? Gaeul! Do you know what lily of the valleys symbolize? You're sure... To be happy. That's why they're only for the person you love. So you know this? Someone told me at the market. I used to come here often with my Seohyeon. She said the island is similar to Nice. How is she doing? I guess she's fine. Did something happen in Paris? Why did you tell me to go after Seohyeon? Because. I've realized... What a dumb guy I've been. There was nothing else I could do, but wait all alone in my apartment. I'm sure she was happy to be with you. Do you know what it's like to be a burden on the woman you love? You said I couldn't do anything by myself. That's before... You were right. I... Aside from my habitual love affair with one woman, there's nothing I can do properly. Take it. I don't want it. It belongs to Seohyeon. You should give it to her. I'm leaving. You'll catch a cold out here. I'm cold. It's too cold to bear. Where were you? I was worried! I'm not a child! I'm allowed to take walks on my own! I didn't know if you were drowning in the water, or bitten by a snake. How could I not be worried? Junpyo! I'm sorry. Hey! I don't want you to swim alone. Don't take walks alone. Got it? - What is it? - Huh? Be careful. It's hot. Want some? No, thanks. Where is it? What? The present I gave you. Oh, that. I left it in my room. I knew you'd be upset if I lost it while wearing it outdoors. As long as it's safe. Hold on tight. - Oh. - Tighter. What's with the bracelet? It doesn't suit you. Really? But I like it. What? It belongs to Jandi. I think she forgot it last night. Please give it to her. Junpyo, aren't you playing? I'm not a child! I'm allowed to take walks on my own! Oh, that. I left it in my room. I knew you'd be upset if I lost it while wearing it outdoors. Junpyo, head's up! - Are you okay, Junpyo? - Are you okay? I'm fine. I said I'm fine. I'm fine. Hey! Where is Jihu? Over there. Where are you going? Fishing. On that boat? All I need... Is a white sail and some wind. Want to join me? Am I invited? If you promise not to scare the fish away. You can free it. Just like that? I can't bear to eat fish from such a beautiful place. Goodbye, fish. Bye. You're working too hard. Why do you keep following me? It's hard to peddle on your own. Even though your legs look strong. Shall we continue where we left off last night? What about? What do you mean Jandi likes someone else? I didn't say that. Who is it? Stop talking nonsense and keep peddling. I'm sure it's someone unimportant. I know a thing or two about women. Girls like Jandi have weak spots for bad boys. The type that sucks the life out of strong women. No way. The guy in question may as well be her soul mate. Soul mate? Women don't know anything. Do you believe in such things? Of course I do. A womanizer like you would never understand. There's that one special person you only meet once in a lifetime. So have you met your soul mate yet? No. But if he appears, I won't let him out of my sight. Because if I do, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Why aren't you peddling? I'm doing all the work. Hurry up. Where are we going? I have something to show you. Look down. It's a heart. It's just like a real heart. I promised myself to bring my first love here. Can you read my heart? What's going on? An emergency situation with Jihu. Here. He's an elite politician. People consider him highly likely to be the next prime minister. I think Jihu found out about it in Paris. I haven't seen him all day. His luggage is still in his room. What shall we do? I'm sure he'll be fine. I know him very well. I can understand why Jihu has changed. Gaeul, what should I do? About what? Things have turned out as you predicted. Jihu is going to hate me. This is just my opinion, but I hope Seohyeon marries a president or a member of a royal family. Like Princess Diana or Audrey Hepburn. She can be the next princess fighting for world peace. Something like that. She's just a model. So? The French President got married to a model. Who knows? Maybe a European prince will fall in love with her. How did you get inside? Are you forgetting who owns the place? Geum Jandi. Huh? Do you accept... My heart? Huh? Don't make me wait too long. Is it true? Or is it just a rumor? Is it a false report? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I think you know her better than I do. Jihu. He's a great person for Seohyeon. I pale in comparison. That's not true. It can't be right. Please tell me you'll be happy. If you're unhappy, I will be too. Why didn't I like someone like you? So... This is it? Junpyo, don't do this! Why not? Don't tell me you're clueless again. Is this another pitfall? I wanted to believe you. I did my best, so I wouldn't have any regrets. I'm sorry. I was very sincere with you. But... This is how you pay me back? No, you're wrong. It's really over. Jandi, don't talk to me ever again. - Junpyo! - Shut up! If you say one more word, I'm going to kill you. He did what? What time? What? Okay. Is he really gone? He took the jet in the morning. Crazy jerk. What's he thinking now? Jandi, do you know why he left? Jandi! I'm back! - Oh! - Hi there! Jandi! Jandi! Jandi, had a nice trip? My daughter. It was the first time you've been abroad. On a private jet at that! You're just so lucky. I'm really happy to see you enjoying life. I can be at peace now. This is just the beginning. When Jandi marries into that family, she'll get evertyhing she wants in life. I have many regrets. Honey. Jandi, I heard the island belongs to Junpyo. Is it true? The Shinhwa Group owns evertyhing? - He's like a king! - A king. And what'll happen when Jandi marries him? Your Highness, the Queen! Your Highness. Please stop, Queen Mother. Queen Mother? Me? Father, then what about me? In historical dramas, the relatives always get into trouble. Gangsan, you have to be careful! It'll never happen. Why not? I won't be talking to Junpyo ever again. Wake up and smell the coffee! Hey! That's... Isn't it pretty? I bought it at the flea market. It's for the special someone you want to spend your life with. To prevent the other person from running away? Don't drink when I'm not around. You should've stayed indoors! I was so angry! I've never waited for anyone before. It's a heart! Can you read my heart? I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Junpyo. I'm sorry. Hey there. No need to be timid. It's an emergency for you, too. Actually, it was always an emergency for you. I'm sorry about what happened at the island. Why are you apologizing? If I hadn't gone to see you... I was the one who kissed you. I should be the one to apologize. I hurt Junpyo's feelings. I'm sure Junpyo looks like this. No, give it to me. He has a fierce look. And this is his face. He has curly hair. I'm sorry. It's okay. I have something to announce in the name of F4. Yun Jihu is no longer a part of F4. What? Junpyo. And after a week, Jihu and Jandi will be expelled from school. Expelled? - Expelled? - Yes. Don't you understand? Kicked out! I don't care if you get expelled, but for Jihu to suffer because of you... Are you ready to take responsibility? It wasn't right for you to attend our school. Jihu and Junpyo were taken by you because they had never seen a poor girl before. They're both too nice. Be responsible. A stupid girl like you has caused the breakup of F4! You have to be responsible! I'll be responsible. How can I be responsible? Jihu? Come to your senses. That's what I want to say to you. Stupid girl, you say? The three of you are even more stupid. Jihu! If you keep this up, we can't defend you anymore! I never asked for your help. You'll regret it! Don't put on such a long face. We're in this together. I don't care about getting kicked out of school. But what about you? I can't believe Junpyo is doing this to you. He can do it. He has the Shinhwa Group behind him. Have you forgotten who the school belongs to? Don't look so sad. I won't give up without a fight. Do you have a good plan? I'll look for one. I have a new reason to fight now. You're right. I can't let him kick you out of F4. You're so stupid. What? I don't care about F4. That look again. I'm home. Welcome home! What's all this? Why are you so late? We need you to work! Go and get changed! What's going on? One good thing leads to another. This is all because you're doing so well. Rumors have spread that our shop brings good luck. What? See? Uniforms from various high schools. Even from across the river. This is great business! This is the first time we've experienced this. I heard you're dating Yun Jihu, and not Junpyo. Where did you hear that? Shinhwa High uniforms were the first to arrive. I don't care if it's Junpyo or Jihu. I don't care who it is. Ever since you got into Shinhwa High, it's been like a dream for me! Honey, I hope I'm not dreaming. Wait a second. I'm sorry. Honey, I told you evertyhing will work out fine. The Shinhwa Group isn't the only large company around. We can turn our business into a large enterprise! An empire! What is it? I tried to understand you. There were times when I thought Junpyo was out of line, but I didn't think I'd be saying this to you. Just get to the point. - Why'd you do it? - Because I wanted to. But Junpyo likes Jandi. - I know. - Jihu! If you had dumped my sister after dating her, I wouldn't be this mad. But you don't have a sister. I'm not kidding. I can't accept you hitting on a friend's girl. I'm sorry for Junpyo. But what? But I can't let him have Jandi expelled. So what'll you do? Anything. Let me warn you. You won't have anyone on your side. Don't be upset. I know how you feel, but Junpyo, I think you're being too harsh. Harsh? If I killed them both, that would be harsh. Jihu's out of his mind. You know what Seohyeon meant to him. He went to see her in Paris. But she's getting married. It's enough to drive anyone mad. I know. I know that he doesn't care for Jandi. He's just using her because of Seohyeon. I can't forgive him for that. Junpyo. Don't take his side anymore. If you say one more word, you're out. Leave Jandi alone. What if I don't? I'm going to protect her. If you remembered that we watched this movie 1 1 times together, none of this would've happened. You're so stupid! I can swim better than you! It doesn't matter who comes out on top. - But Jandi... - Will be expelled. So what about them? Don't you know how lucky Junpyo is to have friends? A Shinhwa heir doesn't need friends. It's not too late. Just one word. Say that you like me. Just one word. I won't regret it. I'll never regret it.
