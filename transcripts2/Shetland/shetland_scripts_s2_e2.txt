 Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. Jimmy. Jimmy! Is it Catriona? Perfectly preserved. When did your sister die, Magnus? A long time ago. She was six. And your mother? After that. Catriona's body's been found, on the hill. And she's holding a doll.

 And I think it's the same doll Agnes has in the photograph. What do you think? Step away from the car. You know why you're here, Magnus? Catriona Bruce was found with this doll. Do you know what Catriona was doing with your sister's doll? Do you know what happened to Catriona? Magnus? Magnus. No! Catriona was holding his sister's doll. And he knew about it. Which means he was probably hiding something from the police at the time. But since we got him down to the station, he hasn't said a word. So, what I want is a custody extension. Is he the link, Jimmy, do you think he's the link?

 Honestly... I don't know. And what about the teacher? Hugo Scott. Well, I mean, he concealed information, lied to us, wasted our time. But he can't drive, doesn't even have a car. So we've checked taxi drivers and rogue operators, his friends - but I don't think we're going to be able to place him in Ravenswick the night Catherine was killed. OK. You can have your custody extension. I'll send someone over with the paperwork. Rhona? Thanks. Don't worry about it. It was a nice walk on the beach, wondering who landed you one - at least it took my mind off the fags. So we're running two murder enquiries now? Until we get a post mortem on Catriona, she's a suspicious death. Now, have you had any luck tracing the family? Still trying. Apparently they went to Canada. OK. Put it out on Twitter that we're looking for them. It's all over social media anyway. What about Magnus? Hasn't said a word. Hasn't eaten. I've been trying, but it's like he's somewhere else. OK. Let's get a psychiatric evaluation. Did you get an extension to keep him in from the Terminator? Yup. She's not sick. She's not ill. Leave her to sleep! She's been through a lot recently. Lying in bed of a morning isn't going to bring anyone back, is it? She needs her rest! You know, everything you said at the start about the two cases not being linked... it's still the only thing that makes sense. Someone who targets children doesn't just switch their attention to teenagers. 19 years. Maybe his tastes changed. Maybe it was never anything but opportunism. Look at the modus operandi! Couldn't be more different. We don't know how Catriona died, but she was hidden - buried. Catherine was left for the world to see. Well, OK, but Catriona had his sister's doll, Magnus knew about it, he lied about it and he was one of the last people to see Catherine alive. I'm not saying he's innocent. I'm saying I can't see him for both of them. Catriona - maybe. Catherine - maybe. But not both. It just doesn't join up the dots. And there's another thing that doesn't make sense. Catherine's father said that she was never without her phone, but the kids at school told Tosh she was weird because she wouldn't use social media. Where are her phone records? They've been checked. No anomalous calls. Her dad called around lunchtime, she phoned Sally Henry a bit later. Nothing after that. That's it? A teenager's phone calls for a month? Cassie's bills come in by the yard. Well, we know she was a bit of a loner. No. Sandy's right. She's not using her phone to stay in contact. So what is she doing with it? Surfing the net? Taking pictures. Everyone takes photographs on their phone. So Catherine never mentioned anything to you, like she'd taken a photograph of something specific or something unusual? Sorry. It must have been hard, finding Catriona. Are you OK? People are angry that it's taken so long. 19 years. Another girl dead. Yes. I understand the frustration. But we don't yet know what happened to Catriona. And we certainly haven't established a link between the two. You people! What are you waiting for? That degenerate cretin is still in his... Margaret! What do you want - witnesses who saw him with his hands around the girls' necks? Well, that would certainly have the advantage of standing up in court. Unlike opinion. Hang on... How did you know it was Catriona? Well, who else was it going to be? I was her teacher. I recognised her shoe. Her shoe? After 19 years? The buckles. She'd been showing them off in class. Diamante. A present from some uncle in America. Oh, nothing but the best for that peerie lass. We're still trying to contact the family. Did you know them? We were neighbours rather than friends. We didn't keep in touch. Photographs? Not that she mentioned. But, like you said, I've not been around much. Are you sleeping out here? Outside, it's just the wind and the cold, it's easier. Inside... ..my mind plays tricks. The little girl, Catriona, will her family be wanting to come back now? We're still trying to find them. If they do, will you tell them from me, if they want to come to the house, they're very welcome. Catherine used to talk about her. About Catriona? She was... curious, I suppose. Little lost girl who used to live here. Macabre, really. But teenagers are, aren't they? Was it him? Who? The old man. Did he kill Catherine too? We don't know who killed Catherine. Or Catriona. Euan - you listen to me. If we don't know, nobody knows. Least of all the gossips. Look. There's nothing that's going to make this any better. But you can make it a hell of a lot worse. Don't go there. Please don't go there. Tosh. Hiya. Look, something's come up. I thought Aberdeen were taking too long with Catherine's laptop so I got onto them. It's been wiped. How? Some tool downloaded from the internet. Not as good as drilling holes in the hard drive, but does the job. They might be able to retrieve some of the data, but it's going to take a while. OK. Thanks for letting me know. All right. Has anybody fed this bird? So Catherine took photographs on her phone. She downloaded them to her laptop. And now her phone's gone, the laptop's been wiped and she's dead. If she was taking photos randomly, did she even know what she had? See? Look at the way she's holding the bag. First, I thought it was just security, you know? Like a teddy bear or something. But it's not just that. She's guarding the contents, she's guarding the phone. So you're saying, whatever she had, it was already on the phone at this point? And that she knew it needed protecting. And since the first person she went to see when she got off the bus was Magnus, she obviously thought it didn't need protecting from him. Catherine's death - it's not Magnus. They've moved Catriona to the morgue. Apparently, they're sending in a specialist - a forensic pathologist from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology department. There was a rock at the bottom of the trench where Catriona was found. The jagged edge was in her skull. The rest of it - all hundredweight of it - was buried in the peat. Believe me, Jimmy - that's not a rock that anyone hefted and threw. So you're saying she fell on it? Moving object, stationary head, injury to the brain here. Stationary object, moving head, injury to the brain here... AND here. So it's just an accident? Christ... What was she even doing there? When I was a peerie lass, we used to play hide and seek in the old peat cuttings. Talk about lethal. You'd disappear in them over your head... and half the time they'd be full of water. But Christ knows, if you wanted to stay hidden... ..they'd hide you forever. Sorry. Hello? Well, if we can't spare uniform to keep a watch on the place, can we at least have them take it in on patrol? Last thing we need is some idiot putting petrol through the letter box. All right. The pathologist. From the archaeological department. Hello? Magnus. I know you didn't kill Catriona. I don't think you killed Catherine either. But until I can find out who did, I'd like it if you stayed here. It would be protective custody. So you wouldn't have to be locked in. See? See, Magnus. I've to feed the bird. The bird's dead. Ahh! I'm sorry. People do stupid things when they get fired up. The bird didn't do any harm. No. Neither did you. She said she was going to make people angry. Maybe she meant angry with me. Who? Catherine. How was she going to make people angry? She didn't say. I was thinking maybe you and I could play a game... ..where I say something that I know about Catherine and then you say something you know. What do you think about that? OK. Yeah? Well, do you want to start? Catherine's dead. Erm... She had blue streaks in her hair. She has red socks. OK. Er, she was about, what do you think... she was about this tall? She likes Marmite, but I don't. No. Erm... She used to babysit you. She was funny. She was funny? What did she say that was funny? That's a question! So it is! OK, you win. You probably knew her the best, didn't you? I'm her favourite girl. Are you? She's sending me a present. What kind of present is she going to send you? It's a surprise. Ah. Are you sure, princess? She said! Why send it, though? Why not just call round? Same reason she sent the photograph to Magnus - cos she was kind. You know what I think? I think she saw how isolated he was, and the kind of life he was leading and she just wanted to give him something nice. A surprise. So do we think Kitty's present is another photograph? I don't know. Right, let's get on to the sorting office and see if they've got anything snarled up in the system. Hang on. Billy. I did what you said. Put it out on Twitter about Catriona. Apparently the mother and father are both dead, but the brother, Brian - his ferry's docking as we speak. OK, Billy, thanks for that. Inspector Perez? They said to look out for you. This is Brian, and Pim. I'm Gret. I'm afraid one of us smells really bad! Can you hold on while we change a nappy? Of course. Brian didn't tell me about Catriona for a long time. Then when he did, so much about him made sense. One big catastrophe that shaped everything that came after. Two filter coffees and a decaf latte. Anywhere you're NOT working these days? The Cop Shop? Just call if you need anything. Where is my sister? She's in the hospital mortuary. Now, I spoke to the pathologist this morning, who told me that your sister's death was an accident. She fell through a crack in the peat. And she hit her head on a rock. Do you want to see her? No. I'll give a DNA sample - whatever you need to confirm it's Cat, but... I don't want to see her. OK. I want Gret to do it. We thought someone should say goodbye. Properly. Can that be allowed? Of course. She looks like she fell asleep yesterday. Yeah. It's the peat. Nothing perishes. Goodbye, Catriona. Du bist so gefehlt. So gefehlt. It was Sandy - he realised when Catherine told Kitty she was going to send a present, she didn't necessarily mean by post. Jess doesn't check her e-mail that often cos the connection in Ravenswick's not great. But when we asked her to have a look, she found this waiting in the inbox. Catherine sent it to Kitty at 22.55 the night she was killed. Catherine! So, what do you like best about living in Shetland? I like the sea. And my green boots. What don't you like about living here? I don't like the yoghurts. There are some that I do like, but the ones I like are too expensive. Anything else? I don't like Mrs Henry. Mrs Henry doesn't like me. She says I am a proper little madam. Mrs Henry doesn't like anyone. Why are you asking all these questions? It's my homework for school. Now tell me a secret. That's easy for you to say. My client would like it noted that he comes here voluntarily. Good. You talked about having set your students an end-of-year project. What was it? That was up to them. It could be anything they chose. What was Catherine doing? I don't know. They were due to hand in their proposals at the end of the midsummer weekend. Catherine didn't come back! Is it possible she could have been making a film? Very possibly. About what? I told you, I don't know. COME ON! You knew her! You taught her! "Receptive, interested and engaged," you said. My client has already answered your questions and does not need... What was she interested in? What were you expecting from her? Excuse me. "Life in the raw - John Grierson and the Scottish documentary movement." The last essay she handed in. It was good. Very good. It was obviously something she'd really thought about. Documentary. A documentary about what? Well, something that was going to make people angry. What subject is a 17-year-old going to pick that makes people angry enough to get her killed? Maybe it's not the subject, maybe it's the questions. "What do you like best about living here? "What do you like least? Tell me a secret." Catriona, Euan Ross said Catherine was interested in what happened to Catriona. We know what happened to Catriona. No. We know how she died. That's not the same thing. I think I might be getting back with Drew. Drew? Again? Seriously? It was that school. All those teenagers. Made me nostalgic. Then I bumped into him in this bar we used to go to. Besides, I can't sleep at this time of year. What else are you going to do to get you through the night? Not just the laptop, then? Was Catherine interested in what happened to Catriona? She used to ask people about it, about what they thought had happened. I think a lot of folk found that... ghoulish. Did she have any ideas herself? Any kind of pet theories? Hello. We're so sorry. So this is Pim. How old? Five months. Five. Do you want to hold her? Can I? Yeah. Just like this. Are you all right? Sorry, I need some air. Are you all right? Gret was a wee bit worried about you. He was having an affair. Who? Dad. Me and Cat didn't know anything about it. I only found out years later. Mum was talking about leaving him and taking us. And in the middle of them trying to work out what to do... Catriona. The house felt different to the way I remember. Childhood memories are strange, aren't they? Mine are made up mostly of what things tasted like. Cat had this... ..secret stash of sweets. Erm... I don't remember how I found it in the end. I just remember the pattern on the carpet and the feel of the empty wrappers in my hands. Kids must make crap witnesses, eh? Remembering all the wrong details. What happened when she found out the sweets were gone? She threw a plate at my head. She threw a plate at you? Oh, Cat was a handful. Her teacher hated her. And my mother struggled. Which didn't help the guilt after. She'd shut Cat in her room that day as a punishment for something and... ..she climbed out the window. It was my mother's worst nightmare that someone had hurt her. Tell me, what did you think of Catherine Ross? She wasn't the friend I'd have chosen for Sally, that's for sure. Why? She liked to court trouble. I worried she'd land them in a situation my daughter wouldn't be able to get herself out of. You taught Catriona. Yes. Did Catherine ever ask you about her? Maybe. I don't recall. The day Catriona went missing. You saw her on the cliffs and you called for her to come back. Is that right? Yes. She didn't listen. That girl never did a thing anyone said! So, if you thought it was dangerous, then why didn't you go after her? It was the holidays. None of my concern. She was seven. Where were you the night Catherine was killed? God above! You think dislike is a justification for murder? If it were, I'd have half my class laid out in their graves. To say nothing of their parents. Now, I have already made a statement to your colleagues... Go through it again. I was here. All night? School the next day. Can anybody corroborate your whereabouts? Mrs Henry? Sally was asleep in bed. So was my husband. So, no. They can't. Sandy said you were looking into why Magnus might have been finger-printed in the past. 1969. Magnus was interviewed about an assault on a girl here on holiday with her family. Someone else was charged and convicted. But, thing is, when I looked for a record of the actual interview, there was nothing. So, I dug a little deeper, and found this. The day after he was interviewed, Magnus was admitted to hospital. Broken ribs, two broken fingers... a fractured skull. Magnus. The reason I wanted you to stay here, is because I wanted you to be safe. But I get the feeling that you will probably never feel safe in here. Because I think something happened to you here. So we're going to find somewhere else to move you to. And then maybe you and me can have a proper talk. Do you understand, Magnus? Is that OK? OK. Whee! Wa-hoo! I don't like Mrs Henry... Mrs Henry doesn't like me. Hey. Hey. All packed? Yep. Well, thanks for taking Cassie. Always a pleasure. Oh, and I don't want the strange old man in my room. You have my bed, he can have yours. Yeah, go and check if you have got everything. OK. Strange old man? Is that what you've told her. Aye. Because I'm no' you. It was nothing - a wee flirt. Just... ..me feeling old, wanting to check that I still got it. You saying I walked in in the middle of your mid-life crisis? I'm putting it down to the poor quality malt that Alex Henry and his mates plied me with at their all-night poker game. You'd think environmental officers would be caring types, but they're a bunch of ruthless bastards. And, yes! I was safe to drive the next morning. No, that's not what I mean... You mean the night Catherine Ross was killed, you were at an all-night poker game with Alex Henry? Yeah, and it was a long one. Hello? Aye, come away in, Billy. Hi, Magnus. Come in. Make yourself at home. So totally your room! OK. Goodbye. Bye. See you. I'm about to ring the bell for school. Yes, just hang on. You told me your husband was asleep with you in bed the night Catherine was killed. That's not true, is it? He didn't kill anyone and nor did I. Why should I have to air our dirty linen to prove it? Which dirty linen? Mrs Henry, do you actually know where your husband was? You thought it was another woman. You didn't ask? Perhaps you didn't feel you had the right to question him. You didn't like Catriona Bruce, did you? You can't expect to like everyone. Because she was - what? Wilful. Spoilt? Her mother ruined her. And her father was having an affair. Who else knew? His wife and your husband... Who else? No-one. Mm. Magnus. What did you call him? "A degenerate cretin"? Yes, well... He was watching. Through the window. Filthy... And Catriona - did she know? She was with him. She saw? It was all so quick, I thought maybe I'd imagined her face. Then ten minutes later, his wife came banging on the door saying Catriona had run away. We all went looking. I saw her on the cliff. I called her. She ran. And that was the last I saw of her. And her father never knew anything about that. How would that have helped him? The man was destroyed already. How did Catherine find out? Did Magnus Bain tell her? Oh, Catherine Ross didn't know a thing! Oh, if she had, she'd have let me feel it. She wouldn't have passed up that opportunity - not that girl. No. The only one who knew... was Magnus Bain. Magnus? Who's that? That's my wife, that's Fran. Where is she? She's dead. Oh... There's a lot of dead folk in the world. Magnus, when I asked you what you and Catherine Ross talked about, and you said you couldn't remember. Is that because what you talked about was Catriona, but... you didn't want to tell me that? She wanted to know a secret. So you told her about Catriona? She'd found her hiding place. She was curious about her. She had a hiding place? Aye, in the house. Tosh? Inspector? Catriona Bruce had a hiding place and Catherine Ross found it. OK. Now, what if she used it? What if she'd made a backup of her documentary? Well, where is this hiding place? Ask Brian Bruce where his sister hid her sweets and search the house. Tosh! Drew. Brian Bruce. Is he in? Checked out first thing. On the eight o'clock ferry. Thanks. Did you tell Catherine Ross about Catriona's father and Margaret Henry? No. That's not my secret. What's your secret, Magnus? You know what I think, Magnus? On the day Catriona went missing, I think she saw something. I think she saw something happen between her father and Margaret Henry. And then I think she went to your croft. And I don't know what happened next. But I've seen your sister's room. And I know the things in it are very precious. Aye... she came looking for her father. I'd seen him going to the Henry house. I said I'd take her. I wouldn't have... ..had I known. And that's why you took her back to your croft, because she was upset about what she'd seen? Aye. She always liked Agnes's room. But... that day... She took Agnes's doll. She wouldn't gie it back. I shouted at her. I chased her. I shouldn't have done that. She was only a peerie lass. And she was that upset about her father, crying to the heart. If I'd known that she was hiding in the peat... ..I'd have gone after her. Aye, it's gey dangerous for children. Why didn't you tell the police? I didn't want them to hurt me again. Sandy. Inspector. We've found it. Found it then, yeah? Yeah. Cool. You got me a drink? Yeah. Thanks! Of course I'm going to get you a drink. Is it whisky? Yeah. It's a good malt. Oh. It's strong! Yeah. So... On you go. Ask away. What do you like best about living in Shetland? Oh. What do I like best? Guess. Um... The girls? The girls. You got that right. Shall I tell you... a secret? You're getting ahead of the script. Secrets come last. Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. You're one of the girls that I like. Ah... You wouldn't be too bad if you made a bit of an effort, but... Really? Yeah. Quite the little lady. If you did something thing with your hair. I'm probably a bit old for you though - 17. What do you mean? I thought the younger the better for you. Sally's only 16. Isn't that why you went for her? Cos anyone who was old enough to know anything would see straight through you... Shit. Call the school. Call the school and find out if Sally Henry's there and safe. I heard one of your girls was only 14. Is that true? Who said... Who told you that? I mean, course you like living here! Big man in a small place, impressing girls half your age with the big car and the big boat and the cheesy lines... Just turn that off! The way you were coming on to me! I asked you to turn that off. "Quite the little lady"... Turn that off! She's not at school. Apparently she called in sick this morning. OK. Put out an urgent call for obs on Isbister's car. I also want you and Sandy to check on Isbister's alibi for the night Catherine was killed. Alibis can be bought. Where are you going to be? Ravenswick. Is Sally home? Sally's at school. No. School just said she phoned in sick today. Sally? Sally? What is it? What's wrong? Sally didn't turn up at school. What are you talking about? Of course she did. I saw her leave this morning. Tosh? She's not here. OK, Sandy's on his way to you. We tracked down Isbister's alibi. He's in Whalsay, I'm going to go and speak to him now. But no luck with Isbister himself. His office said he hasn't been in this morning, and he's not answering his phone. OK. What if she's freight? If an alibi can be bought, surely a truck driver can? That detective... he kept coming back. I just wanted it all to go away. I just wanted to be with you. Look... Will you stop talking about the police? OK? I never brought you here to talk. I didn't tell him anything. I knew where Catherine was the night before. She was at your party. But I didn't say anything. I don't... I don't want to speak ill of the dead... but she WAS a silly bitch, your friend. You're not going to be a silly bitch... are you? How many more of these are there? 30 odd. That's not so many. If I were them, I'd sell the pelagic trawler and get another fleet like this. But that is me. I like trucks. It was always the trawler Alan talked about. Not the trucks, the trawler. Thanks. Whereabouts...? North Roe. We could get a drink in a minute. Hey... Don't get dressed. There's ice in the kitchen. Do you want some? I just need to go to the bathroom. It's just down there. Tosh? Inspector, I've just finished speaking to Isbister's alibi. And he says they were together all of Sunday night. What? Isbister's alibi checks out. Isbister's alibi checks out. Alan! Alan! Alan! Ice and a slice. Step away from her. What for? She's 16. I said step away from her. She's 16! Sally? You are going to have to come with me now. Why? You know why. Oh, Sally... Was he really worth it? OK. I don't understand. What's going on? Get a solicitor and come down the police station. What's the charge? Assaulting Catherine Ross, along with questions about another matter. And for God's sake, man, do your trousers up. What's going on? Where's he going? Why isn't that man in handcuffs? Mrs Henry, you and your husband are going to have to come down to the station. We're going to be charging Sally with the murder of Catherine Ross. Oh, don't be ridiculous, man! Alex! Sally! When did Catherine show you the film? Sunday night. It was on her phone. And is that when you killed her? She was her friend! Sally? I don't want them in here. Sally... I don't want them in here. You know... ..people say "friend" like that means it's simple. But it's not... ..it's really complicated being close. Why would you hurt someone who didn't matter? She knew I liked him. She knew. And she made him look like a stupid thug. She said she was going to put it on YouTube. She knew my life... ..how crap everything is. She was so confident, she could have anything she wanted. And she couldn't even leave me the crumbs. It took time, what you did. Minutes... not seconds. You could have stopped. You could have let go. I didn't want to let go. She called me "baby girl". I was crying and she said, "Poor baby girl." I really miss her. I really miss her. Are you OK? Aye. Is there anything you need? Anything I can help you with? Magnus. What happened to you before, in the police station... that was wrong. Whar's du fae? I'm fae Fair Isle. Fair Isle. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.
