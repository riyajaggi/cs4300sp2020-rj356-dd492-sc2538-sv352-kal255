 The snow, dear Adso, is an admirable parchment on which the bodies of men leaves writings very legible. He did not throw himself alone in the tank. Someone has worn it. And already dead, I guess. Venantius was killed in the tower. Probably in the library. Why tread him from the tower to throw it in pig blood? In the library, it would have been found less easy, it's a labyrinth. Maybe the assassin did he care That the body was discovered. Why ? I do not know, I put hypotheses. He may have killed him to leave a sign. What sign? That's what I do not know. You alone are worthy of the beauties of this world. My sin will never be forgiven. I, John XXII, sovereign pontiff,  want to communicate to you,  reverts abb , the following:  It's Bernard Gui who will be At the head of our delegation.  The conference will not have to in no way to start  before it arrives.  The power of the church has two swords,  the spiritual and the temporal.  The first must be handled  by the church, and the second for the church.  No injury. No bruising at the head. No sign of poisoning. Neither lac rations nor bruises. Some poisons do not leave a trace. It depends what you mean by poison. There are substances that,  small doses, are beneficial, but otherwise fatal. It takes little to pass from drug to poison. The Greeks name one and the other "Pharmacon". You have poisons in your laboratory? Obviously. Like any good herbalist. I use them with discretion. And nobody, Other than me enter my laboratory. Did you notice that? Strange, is not it? The other hand? Nothing. Nothing. Sverin, open his mouth. The language is black. What poison blackens the body? Any deadly substance leaves marks on the organs. You suggest I open the corpse? The question is : are you able to do it? I am a graduate of Padua. Can I go out for a while? My boy! I recognized your steps. I went for a walk. The air is fresh, but pure. He is vitiated in the scriptorium. The goats, It transpires. Why are you the Franciscan? To learn. Mfie up ... of this man. How is that? Disappearing is not the solution. Whatever you are fleeing, It will catch you. The pancreas is ulcerated. The liver is infested with nodules. Can I see where your poisons are? I told you, dangerous substances are under key. I am the only one to have access. Yes, you told me. What an incredible collection! Many of these substances, rare or not growing under our climate, were reported to me by monks from around the world. Agati pil . Indian Alo s. My word ! Balsamic Myrrh. Extracted from the gum of a shrub. The work of my life. You have enough substances here to heal the world, or to reduce it. Chinese. Orpiment. It is empty. This vial. - Empty? - The vial is ... completely empty. It was a viscous solution. A monk brought it back from the East. There are years. It was a gift. From a primitive tribe. It's ltalian. Who knows? The abbot. Malachi, maybe. I have not known since when I disappeared. How could you open a man? S verin, finally, but what did you do? He was poisoned. He had to. It is this Franciscan beast who forced you? It is this Franciscan beast who asked him, effectively. You speak our language. It is authorized by the church. J'tais ... Forgive me, I wanted to see you because I have the manuscript that interests you. Charming attention. It will occupy my sleepless nights. All the more that this vial of empty orpiment may keep me awake some time. A moment ! Dear brother. I have to search the abbey and the cells of the brethren loosed. Not those of the monks. What are you looking for ? A bottle filled with poison. Where do you live? What are you eating ? Where do you sleep? A house. It's yours ? They were all killed. I have to go. - Always nothing ? - No. What were you doing outside the abbey? A walk in forest. For Saint J r me, women were created to submit to temptation. - who is this cell? - B renger. Open, please. However, I can not believe that God introduced a being so foul without giving it of particular virtues. Search everywhere. Master? Who is this blood? Pigs or the murderer? Or Adelme? If we broke his head before pushing him of the tower. You are the last I saw Adelme alive. Brenger. Me ? How can you say that? I saw him going to sleep, like the others. You saw him again and you know more that you do not pretend. It's you, it seems to me. Not at all. It was in your cell. I swear, on everything that is most dear to me, I do not know where this blood comes from nor who he is. Two monks died, you can not keep quiet. I saw Adelme tonight. But he was already dead. He wandered among the dead. What did he say ? "I am damned. "You have before you a survivor of hell. "And in hell, I have to go back." Hold my hand,  my handsome master.  "Hold my hand, "My beautiful master." So that my meeting be useful teaching ...  "So that my meeting "you be useful teaching "in exchange from everything you taught me. " When I took his hand ... she burned me. Why did He call you? his handsome master? Did you have him taught something? Nothing, ever! I'm afraid, father. I want to confess to you. Mercy! A devil devours me the bowels. No, do not ask me to confess you. Do not close my lips by opening yours. You will speak otherwise. And if not, I will discover the truth by myself. You can claim mercy, but do not claim my silence. You are too quiet here. Go, here. He had his hand burned. Nothing to do with the beyond. Flowing wax of a lamp can burn as well. That would be the murderer? Maybe. Or someone try to make us believe. B renger suffers because he knows he has pushed Adelme death by making him do something. It's easy to imagine what, my poor Adso, after what we were told our help-librarian. But why keep this in his cell? Was not it easier to get rid of it? Yes ? Our presence is strange. It may be Malachi who stole the poison. God bless you. My brother. We do not want you here, marauds. Go back from where you are coming from! Let them go. They are good people, who are fleeing the war to live and work in peace. Leave it! P nitenziagit ! the attack! Kill them all ! Do not let them escape. Come with us. Dolcino! The soldiers are leaving. Let them go, Marguerite. Follow me. If the world does not want you, know that before you, he rejected Christ. But I will liberate you. A new era is coming! We took up arms to liberate all those who suffer! P nitenziagit ! I feel bad, take care of them. However you want. A new justice! A new church! True love on earth for us and our children. Be intrested! We have been walking for days, but no one is tired. No one complains. No one is sick or hungry. Is not this a miracle? You know why ? Because we are not afraid. Advance! You would like to be a beautiful cavallo. But you are ugly. Salvatore is doing good paper now. Hold on. I am not your master. You saved my life. I'm your slave. Stop! Remember, we are all equal. Nobody has to kiss the hand of another. You do it. You kiss the hand from abbe the porco. Like a. You do. I pretend. For us to eat. Some kill to eat, others kiss hands. Only to live. All the same, all kind, all beautiful, all gaux. Todos iguales, beautiful todos. So beautiful Salvatore. Belissimo too. The Franciscan know that the poison was stolen. He will discover everything. We have to go? Salvatore and Remigio leave! Leave me alone. Dolcino says that the crosses will lose.  God will not allow their victory.  You do not believe it anymore, Remigio. Me, do not believe in Dolcino anymore? I confided to him everything that I am. All... what I like the most. Do not worry about me. Come. If we happen to be unhappy ... If Dolcino and me ... You will know protect it. Swear to me that you will protect Anna. Nothing will happen to him. I swear to you. Nothing will happen  Anna.  Anna, I'm going to find my love again. The nearest city ? After this wood. Pietranera. A Dolcean enclave? Witchcraft. Get out of there! Go! Piti ! I am mother! A mother? Are you married? This is your wife? Answer! Not at all, is it? Sorry, I'm sorry! I will not do it again ! You copulate? What else do you do? What other rituals? Where are you from? Why does she fear where do you say where you live? I will tell you. She has seduced you by telling you that adultery was not a sin. That God allowed copulation. That's it? Do you share his beliefs? Or is it only to enjoy ? Pietranera's heretics! I am not heretic, I do not come from Pietranera. She, yes! The demon is and will always be a master in imposture. His weapon of choice, wife. Advance! How to distinguish Dolphinians true Christians? "Kill them all. "God will recognize his own." Save us! My baby ... Brother Guillaume, I was first, but after much reflection, you must know all the truth. Malachie is ... I'm sure he knew for B renger and Adelme. They were ... sodomites. That's what I imagined. But Malachi did not react. He protected B renger. Just as he protects the mysteries of this place. Brother Guillaume, the restrictions are suffocating us. A student must know wonders what does this library contain? and the books we hide. Would not you do it yourself shameful things to get what you are looking for for years? B renger has flown to Adelme. One thing Adelme wanted. I do not know what, but ... B renger used it to convince Adelme to do ... what he expected of him. B renger wanted Adelme. And Adelme was ready for anything ... to get this thing. She was in a cloth. I did not see her. Venantius he'd been shouting from his cell. B renger saw it. I too surprised them. B renger knows it. My door was open. I hope I'll help you. Sodomy in a monastery. Frangule. A good infusion is made from the bark. For h morro des. What do you think of Bence? His story stands. Adelmo ... after he broke the chastity, run to the church to bow down, but his remorse does not subside. He may be talking about Venantius secret gift from B renger, which does not matter to him anymore. What happens to Venantius? - Who's killing him? B renger? - Possible. Or Malachie, or another. B renger is suspicious because he is afraid. Could not the killer be Bence? We need two things: enter the library, where all this history may have started, and a lamp. You'll take care of it. Go to the kitchen and take one. - Flight ? - A loan. For the glory of the Lord. Serene day. Thanks to God. Serene in the sky, but black on the earth. The Béte r dansde in the abbey. What kind of food? The Great Beast that rises from the sea Where did you see it? In the library? The library? I never set foot in the library. The library is a big labyrinth, maze symbol what is the world. You enter and you do not know if you'll come out. You do not know how to get in once everything is closed? You go through the ossuary. You can go through the ossuary, but I do not recommend it. The dead monks are watching. Have you ever spoken to from the door leading to the ossuary? In the crypt? The fourth crÃ¨ne, press your eyes and you are in the ossuary. But do not go there. I never went there. The abb does not want to. After you. We close? Do we leave a way out? And the Beast? - Where did you see the Beast? - I do not know. I do not know anymore. Some rats. On the way to the library. Now you understand why Malachi has the face also austere. But times are poor. Did not you hear the 7 trumpets? The 7 trumpets? Have not you heard how the illuminator? The 1st angel sounded the trumpet and fire and fire befell m l s of blood. The scriptorium must be At this level. The 2nd angel sounded the trumpet and the third of the sea became blood. Is the second boy not dead? in a sea of ​​blood? Take care the 3rd trumpet. The surroundings of the abbey are affected by heresy. The p ch entered the abbey. Should not we go see the Adelme table? There were two books. One of them Was in Greek. A page has fallen. Approach the light. Damn, little one! Fantastic. Your clumsiness is useful. Venantius wanted to hide an important secret and used an ink that writes without a trace and reappears to heat. The Arabs know each other. It's him, go! Fool that I am! He took my glasses in addition to the book. He knows that I can not decipher without. Course, Adso! Quick ! I promise you! I served in the imperial army. It is only me. Who hits objects. There is nobody. Where did he go? This place was once a fortress. It must be full of secret passages. The forbidden door. By Merlin's beard! Who ? A wizard. From my country. If I had my glasses, I will not leave this place anymore. What treasure ... All the books, although different, consist of the same elements: spaces, commas, the punctuation, and the 22 letters of the alphabet. Saint Jean. The apocalypse. Alinardo told us about it. Master? Master? Come fight!  What a coward!  Fight!  Unable to kill, if not your mother at birth.  Adaptation: Karine Adjadji Subtitles: VSI - Paris
