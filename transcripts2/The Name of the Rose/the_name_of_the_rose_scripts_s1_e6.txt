 I'm going to church. If I can find it! The greatest worth of a man... ...is not his virtue, but the struggle... ...to transform into virtue... ...the malice within him. Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Ave Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners now in the hour of our death. Hail Mary full of grace, the lord is with thee

 Blessed art thou amongst women... ...and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Ave Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners... Most reverend one... Dear brother. Will you join me? You sent for me. You have something to tell me? I hear voices. Many voices. Concerning your late assistant. The envious... ...are always bitter and poisonous in their lies. They deserve only pity.

 They envied you as well, for the voices spoke of you too. Things that, if verified, could carry you all the way to the stake. Are you there? Cave basilischium! Tant pleno of poison, even the stink comes out behind... ...and kills you! What are you doing with a basilisk? Mi cosas. My things. Not your things. With all the deaths and mystery here... ...there can be no more secrets. Show me. - No! I will have to tell my master. No, no, no, no! Shh! See, no tell. Yes? - Yes. Look! Stinks. Puteat. Horseshit! Caca de caballo! Tercero. Tertius equi... For make love. - Yeah, but what are you saying? I explain. First you kill the cat. Take off ojos, eyes. Open two uevos... ...and put eyes into uevos. And then uevos into horseshit. Caca de caballo. Then the girl must spit, sputade, you know... Sputare on the uevos in the horseshit. And then she love me. She love Salvatore. Salvatore! Wait! Come here! Ilustrissimo magnifico bibliothekar wunderbar? What are you doing here? Why aren't you at work? Ich gehen! Tout de suite! Now! No, wait! What is in that bag? Nada. Nothing. A... A cat. Matto! Gatto matto. Schwarze katze. Black. Porto via... I take away. What have you brought? I have brought some meat. What have you brought? - Eggs and vegetables. What have you brought? Many bags of grain. What have you brought? I was with them. I just wanted to see you, master cellarer. But I don't know you. Swear to me you'll protect Anna. You carry on. It's you? She didn't come back last night. I looked for her, but she was gone. You know him? - Yes. Go now. You cannot stay here. Do you know who betrayed them? No. It makes no difference now. I saved you. Mama! - Shh! She will come later. As your mother made me promise. That's all that matters. I'm sorry about what happened in Pietranera. Tell me where the inquisitor sleeps. Are you insane? Tell me where he sleeps. Second cell on the gallery. No. Maybe the third. I'm not sure. Don't even think about it. I am not leaving. Please... I want my father's letters. - Anna... Give me my father's letters and I promise you I will leave. Kneel down here and pray. The Pope wants no part of a mediation. Then I will go to Avignon... - Yes, and risk your life. Malachi! - What is it? The package, the letters I gave you. I want them back. No. I... do not have them. What do you mean you do not have them? Where are they? William, William! William, I have to tell you something. Certainly Berengar came to the infirmary... ...before he went to his death in the baths. How do you know? - You know you told me... ...that he must have gone somewhere else to hide the book. Yes, I did. - I found... ...a strange book in my laboratory among the other books. A book that is not mine. A book in Greek. Bring it to me at once. - I cannot, because... I will explain to you later. Please... I have discovered something. Please, you must come. I must show you the book discreetly. William, we cannot wait any longer. Please, go back to the place you came from. Lock yourself in and wait for me. Stop whoever goes near the infirmary. I need to know where they are! Keep quiet! Make sure those papers are safe! They don't go back to where they came from! And I apologize and beg forgiveness... ...for my part in the disturbance... ...that occurred during yesterday's debate. I too ask forgiveness... ...for what my mouth has said... ...that offended your and my very soul. Now that our debate can proceed in its proper spirit... ...I invite brother William of Baskerville... ...to express the position of those theologians... ...who advise the Emperor. I will simply make some scattered observations... ...which I do not claim to be articles of faith. Excuse me, it's been a very... humid day. Our Lord has given to Adam and his descendants... ...power over the things of this earth, provided they obey the divine laws. We might infer that the Lord also was not averse to the idea... ...that in earthly things, the people should be legislator... ...and effective first cause of the law. By the terms 'people,' it would be best to signify all citizens. But since among citizens, children must be included... ...as well as idiots and malefactors, perhaps it would be reasonable to arrive... ...at the definition of the people as the better... ...part of the citizens. I do not think it opportune... ...to assert who actually belongs to that part. It seems sensible, the way in which the people could express its will... ...might be an elective general assembly, because if the law is made by one man alone, he could do harm through ignorance or malice. All of us have experienced this. Christ did not come into this world to command. But to be subject to the conditions... ...he found in the world. He did not want his apostles to have command or dominion, therefore it seemed a wise thing... ...that the successors of the apostles... ...should be relieved of any worldly or coercive power. All this is no limitation... ...of the supreme powers of the Pontiff, but rather an exaltation of his powers: Because the servant of the servants of God... ...is on this earth to serve and not to be served. I've heard, in this room, very wise people assert that it could not be proved... ...that Christ had been poor. Whence it seems to me more fitting... ...to reverse the demonstration. Jesus sought no earthly jurisdiction... ...for himself and his disciples. Or does someone want to suggest the idea that he did wish it, but lacked the time or the ability to say so... ...in three years of preaching? It seems to me sufficient evidence... ...to suggest the belief that on the contrary, Christ preferred poverty. I would be very happy if Brother William, so skilled and eloquent in expounding his own ideas, were to submit them to the judgement of the Pontiff. You have convinced me, my lord Bernard. I will not come. This fluxion which is affecting my chest... ...dissuades me from undertaking... ...such a long journey in this season. Then why did you speak at such length? To bear witness to the truth. The truth shall make us free. Here we are not talking about the truth, but excessive freedom that likes to set itself up to be free! That is also possible. I beg your pardon, but if the Franciscans... ...choose to remain poor, no one can oppose this desire... ...that is simply virtuous! The fact is you want to impose it on the entire church. Brothers, it is possible that this profitable discussion... ...may be resumed, but for the moment an event of tremendous gravity... ...obliges us to suspend our session, with the abbot's permission. Something has happened. Let me go! Please, reverend abbot! Save me! Have mercy! You must believe me. Severinus was already dead when I came in. I swear it! With my own eyes I saw Severiunus lock himself inside... ...while Remigio went towards the tower. It was not me. You see, I ordered the cellarer to be arrested. He was already dead! We discovered the cellarer frantically... ...rummaging through the shelves, flinging everything on the floor. It is evident that Remigio had entered, attacked Severinus, killed him... ...and then was seeking... ...the thing for which he had killed. I beg you, that is not the way it was! That is not the way! Remigio of Varagine. I had sent my men after you... ...on the basis of other accusations... ...and to confirm other suspicions. Now I see that I have acted properly, Although to my great regret, too late. I hold myself virtually responsible... ...for this latest crime, because I have known since this morning... ...that this man should be taken into custody! Will your magnificence put at my disposal... ...a room where this man may be confined? We have some cells in the basement of the smithy... ...which, fortunately, are very rarely used... ...and have stood empty for years. Fortunately or unfortunately? Malachi, you swore, and I swore too! I will do nothing to harm you, Remigio. At the tomb of Abbas Agraphicus. Tell her to disappear. After our meal, a court will convene in the chapter house... ...to open this investigation officially. Naturally, brother William... ...I shall count on your presence. Reverend, I would be most grateful... ...if you had everyone exit. I want to examine the room more thoroughly. Only Adso and... Benno should be allowed to stay. All must leave! Abbot, I stay. Severinus was my friend. Brother William has requested that all leave. We came from the same land. We spoke the same language. I want to remain at his side. I will not move from here. Brother, this is not the library. Here you can claim no rights. Therefore I ask you to leave. Quietly. - Malachi, come. I came in right after you, when the room was still half-empty. And Malachi was not here. He must have entered afterward. - No. I was near the door. I saw the people come in. I tell you, Malachi was already inside before. Before what? Before Remigio entered. I cannot swear it, but I believe he came from over there, when there were already many of us in here. Are you insinuating that Malachi killed Severinus... ...and then hid behind that wall when Remigio came in? Or else he witnessed what happened out here from in there. Why else would Remigio have implored Malachi... ...not to harm him, promising in return not to do him harm either? That is possible. In any case, there was a book here... ...and it should still be here. Stay by the door. Let no one enter. Open the door. Let us in. Adso, give me Severinus's books. I know everything is against me, but I swear... I swear I did not kill Severinus. I did not kill him. Shh, do not be afraid. You are in the hands of brothers... ...who only want what is best for you. The fact is, you do not know what is best. Think about this. You have not much time. Let us see if you will be able to free yourself... ...from the evil you have done. From all the evil you have done. And your judge will look with pity... pity... on your soul. You will rip me to pieces. Slowly. Holy Reverend. I want to report that this morning I met that repulsive creature, Salvatore. He was acting strangely. He had a sack with a black cat. And what is more, I had the impression that he was trying... ...to hide or destroy something. Something that might belong to his friend, the cellarer. You should send your soldiers to the paper mill. Come on, Benno, move! Hold back! - We need to wash the body! You have to wait! - But, brother! Thesaurus herbarum. Don't waste your time on those. We're looking for a Greek book. This one? It's Arabic, idiot! Roger Bacon was right: the scholar's first duty is to learn languages! You don't know Arabic either. At least I understand it when I see it! But it must be here somewhere. Remigio didn't take it. - Absolutely not. When he grabbed me by the chest... ...it was obvious he had nothing under his scapular. Nor did Malachi. Otherwise he wouldn't have insisted... ...on remaining here. Couldn't the assassin have thrown the book out the window... ...and then gone outside to fetch it later? Go and look, all right? What did Remigio whisper to you? He asked for help. Remigio? - He told me you must leave. The inquisitor had him arrested. Why? - A monk was killed. Did Remigio do it? - Come. He was going to bring me... - What? Nothing. Nothing. They will commit another injustice. As in my day. Leave now. If you see her, make her understand I... I will come as soon as I can. Uevos, uevos, uevos! Lousy, horirble monster! Don't you dare touch me! May the Devil take you away! You and your cat! Me no hurt you. Malem non facio. Du liebe mich. Amore. Go fuck yourself! Benno, let us in! Nothing. No trace. No book. If the book is not in this room... ...then obviously someone else came in here before. Remigio was in the kitchen. How could he make Severinus open the door, attack... ...and kill him... ...and then make all this mess... ...in such a short time? Malachi could have come before them all. He persuades Severinus to open the door and kills him. But if Malachi was looking for the book, he should have recognized it without all this ransacking, because he's the librarian. So who's left? Benno. No. Brother William, no. You know I was consumed by curiosity. If I had been in here and had been able to leave with the book I would not be here now keeping you company. I would be examining my treasure somewhere else. An almost convincing argument. However, you do not know what the book looks like either. You could have killed and now you're here... ...trying to identify the book. I am not a murderer! - No one is... ...until they commit their first crime! The fact is, the book is missing. Poor Severinus. I had suspected even you and your poisons. Instead death came to you from the heavenly vault. I wonder why they chose this particular weapon. This is a fine example... ...of metals and astronomical science. And now it is... Good heavens! - What is it? 'And the third part of the sun was smitten... ...and the third part of the moon... ...and the third part of the stars.' The fourth trumpet. - Indeed. First hail, then blood, then water and now the stars. If this is indeed the case, then everything must be re-examined. The murderer did not strike at random, but was following a plan. Imagine a mind so evil, that he kills only when he can do so... ...following the dictates... ...of the book of the Apocalypse. What will happen with the fifth trumpet? The fifth trumpet promises many things. From the pit will come the smoke of a great furnace... ...and then the locusts will come from it... ...to torment mankind with a sting similar to a scorpion's. But let us not pursue fantasies. Let us try and remember what Severinus said. You told him to bring the book to you at once... ...and he said he couldn't. Why couldn't he? A book can be carried. And why did he put on gloves? Is there something in the book's binding connected to poison? As we have seen, the poison had to enter the mouth. He said he needed to show it to me here, discreetly, and then he put on his gloves. So we know the book must be handled with gloves. And that goes for you too, Benno, if you find it, as you hope to. And since you are being so helpful, go up to the scriptorium again and keep an eye on Malachi. Do not let him out of your sight. I will not. There's nothing more to be done. Brother William. You don't really trust Benno, do you? We told him nothing he does not already know. In sending him to watch Malachi, we're also sending Malachi to watch him. How can Malachi harm Remigio? We will know soon enough. Certainly Remigio wanted to avert some danger... ...that was terrifying him. So the book has vanished again. Just a moment. We say it is not there, because we did not find it. Yeah, but we looked everywhere. We looked, but did not see. How did Severinus describe that book? He said he'd found a book that was not one of his, in Greek. No, he called it a strange book. Severinus was a man of learning... ...and for a man of learning a book in Greek is not strange, nor is a book in Arabic, even if he did not know Arabic. If he called it strange, it was because it had an unusual appearance. Unusual at least for him, who was not a librarian. And it can happen, in many libraries, that several ancient manuscripts are bound together, some in Greek, some in Aramaic. - And one in Arabic! Teuton animal! You ignoramus! The one in the metal frames! You looked at the first page and not at the rest! Master, you were the one who looked at it... ...and said it was Arabic and not Greek. That is true, Adso, that is true. I am the animal. Run! Hurry! Who came in here after I left? I don't know. Malachi? - Benno. He laughed at my ignorance when I spoke of the book in Arabic. He wasn't laughing at your ignorance, but at my gullibility. We've been looking for this Greek text for three days. It's only natural that one would make a mistake. It is certainly human to make mistakes, but there are human beings who make more mistakes than others... ...and they are called fools. I wonder whether it was worth the effort... ...to study in Paris and Oxford... ...if I am then incapable of thinking... ...that manuscripts are also bound in groups. A fact even novices know. But there's no use weeping. If Malachi has the book... ...he has already replaced it in the library. And we would only find it... ...if we knew how to enter the Finis Africae. She didn't come back last night. I looked for her, but she was gone. You will love me. You will love me. Bona ragassa. Good girl. Mi paqueno ruisenor. My nightingale... What do you want here? - None of your business. No one uses my irons except us. No! Please... - We haven't even started yet! What does he want me to say? Say what Reverend Bernard wants to hear. I will not. The Lateran Council in its Canon Thirty-seven... ...decreed that no person may be summoned... ...to appear before a judge whose seat... ...is more than a two days' march from his domicile. But here the judge has come, and from a great distance. The inquisitor is exempt from all normal jurisdiction... ...and does not have to follow precepts of ordinary law. He enjoys a special privilege... ...and is not even bound to hear lawyers. Yes? - Yes. I, brother Bernard Gui... ...Dominican inquisitor, delegated by the Apostolic See, invested with authority by His Holiness the Pope, proceed with the interrogation of the defendant... ...with regard to two equally odious crimes... ...one of which is obvious to all... ...because the defendant was surprised in the act of murder. While at the same time, he was being sought for the crime of heresy. In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Who are you? Remigio of Varagine. I was born 52 years ago. And while still a boy, I entered the convent of the Franciscan Minorites. And how does it happen that today... ...you are found in the order of Saint Benedict? Years ago, there were some monks... ...who were tempted by heresy. Which heresy? The apostolics. There were many of them who spoke. And because I was afraid of being affected by heresy... ...I thought it was better for my sinning soul... ...to escape such seductive temptations. You escaped the seductions of heresy. Or rather you escaped the investigation... ...of those who had determined to discover the heresy... ...and uproot it. But changing habit is not enough to erase from the soul... ...the evil of heretical depravity. My soul is innocent, and I do not know what you mean... ...when you speak of heretical depravity. You see? They're all alike! When one of them is arrested, he faces judgement as if his conscience were without remorse. And they do not realize that this... ...is the most obvious sign of their guilt. The girl must spit and then she love me. She love Salvatore. Habemus horse shit. Caca de caballo. Eggs, eggs. Eggs. Now... Cat's oculos! Voilà. Smell... Come here. - Leave me alone! Touch me, and Adso will tear you apart. Puta diavola! Adso, no good. Pas bon pour toi! Salvatore good! Escape together. Nous allons at sea. Donde esta el mar. No more priests, no more inquisitor. No mas. Listen to me. Sputa! Spit! Here. And you will love me. Por favor, por favor. Spit. Please. Sputa. No, no, no, no, no! Here. On the egg. Uevo. No. This one. Sputa. Sputa, sputa. Spit. Come here! You are mine! Let us ask him if he knows... ...the reason why I had ordered his arrest. Do you know it, Remigio? My lord, I would like to learn it from your lips. There. The typical reply of the impenitent heretic. They cover their trails like foxes. It is very difficult to catch them out. They are clever enough to trap the inquisitor, who already has to endure contact... ...with such loathsome creatures. Very well then, tell me, what do you believe? I believe... ...everything a good Christian should believe. A holy reply. And what does a good Christian believe? What the Holy Church teaches. But which holy church? The church that is so considered... ...by those who call themselves perfect; namely the New Apostles, or the church they compare to the whore of Babylon! My lord, tell me which you believe is the true church. I believe it is the Roman church, one, holy, apostolic, governed by the Pope and his bishops. So do I. Admirable shrewdness! Tell me, do you believe that the Roman church... ...has the power to loosen and to bind on this earth... ...that which is bound and loosened in heaven? Should I not believe that? I did not ask you what you should believe. I asked you what you did believe. I believe everything that you and the other good doctors... ...command me to believe. But are not these good doctors you mention... ...perhaps those who command your sect? Is that what you meant... ...when you spoke of the good doctors? Are these perverse liars the men you follow... ...in recognizing your articles of faith? You imply that if I believe what they believe, then you will believe me. Otherwise you will believe only them. I did not say that, my lord. You are making me say it. I believe you, if you teach me what is good. What impudence! You accuse yourself with your own words! No! Spit first. Then bread. Nightingale? No this! No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. You are doing owl! Not nightingale. Look mouth. Look my mouth. Look. This is good. This is good. Bellissima. It'll all be fine. It's going to be fine. Do not touch him! Come on! Move it! Watch out! Go! Go, go! After her! - Quickly! Kill him! Lui malo, oi buonissimo, libera me! Come back here!
