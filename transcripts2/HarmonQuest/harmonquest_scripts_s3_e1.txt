 Spencer: Last season on "HarmonQuest"... the dragon plummets into the stone seal, and then all is quiet, and all is gone. - I'm gone? - Maybe we can find our way back. Spencer: Since that fateful day, our heroes have been working tirelessly in order to find a way to bring their friend Boneweevil back home. - I am Celty Cerrilian, the Sorcerer of the Storm! Spencer: Celty opens a magical portal. You find yourself in the demon realm!

 There's a blue blur. both: Boneweevil! Spencer: You gotta go to the abyss. Once you get to the abyss, you can get out. - But you're gonna have to defeat me in a challenge. - We challenge you to bar trivia. - Looks like we're losing. You guys are losers. - [screams] - We just killed death. Spencer: You begin to fall up into the topless pit of the abyss. - That demon witch, Celty, she's at it again, flying around in a magical castle. She's pure evil!

 Spencer: It looks like the boundary between hell and Earth is falling apart. - If we take out the central core in the middle of the obelisk, this whole thing should come crashing down. - Yeah, I-I-I killed the pillar! Spencer: The clouds above explode as a massive floating castle breaks through the stormy canopy. - Every time bad things happen, it's your fault. - You're a dick! [yells] - Get ready to get stabbed. - What are we doing? - Fighting. - Look at this. What do you say we finish this off with one last door? Spencer: You fall to the ground, a smoldering corpse. - What the fuck? - I pick up Fondue's sword. Spencer: It seems the sword has captured your spirit. [door bangs] - I thought I had it all figured out. All you had to do was just stay dead. [thunder booms] [laughing] Now here we are. Some fucking morons killed the caretaker of the abyss. Hell and Earth have been crossing over, and all that's been keeping it separate is my obelisk network. I'm very upset. I'm dead. - Not the best communicator. Maybe it's fine. [people screaming] Spencer: The demon realm has converged with the material plane. It's hell on Earth, and it's kind of your fault. Since the dawn of the 1970s, fantasy role-playing games have provided men and women with an escape from their awkward lives. Today, the most awkward of them all, Dan Harmon, is summoning celebrity friends to play these games of old in front of a live studio audience in Hollywood. I am Spencer, the Game Master, and this is "HarmonQuest"! [cheers and applause] - Thank you, thank you, thank you. God, it is so good to be back. Welcome to season three of "HarmonQuest," birthplace of a weight loss plan I like to call "seeing ourselves in season two"... [laughter] Which appears to have worked very well for more than a few of us. It is fantastic to be back. I am the titular Harmon, but that is a mistake because the actual star-- and I would call him the creator at this point of the show, certainly the sole producer of it-- the Game Master, Spencer Crittenden. - Yeah. [cheers and applause] - [mouthing words] - So joining me once again-- thrilled to have her back-- the immaculate, the conceptual... - [giggles] [laughter] - Erin McGathy. [cheers and applause] My other lifelong partner, the beautiful Jeff Davis. [laughter] [cheers and applause] And returning as our guest role-player and someone that probably is way better at introductions than me, our friend Matt Gourley. [cheers and applause] - Hi, hi. Hi. Uh! - And you're-- you play my father in the narrative that we have going so far, and you're better-looking than me. You're more talented than me. You're smarter than me. - Where did this come in? When... [laughter] - I'm trying to, like, splay my nervousness. I don't belong on television. What else is going on with you? Is there something that... - It seems all I do are podcasts, so... - You're the podcast master. You've elevated the art form. - [laughs] - You're the Noam Chomsky of podcasting. - That, I'll take. [laughter] - As we all know and as probably they know, but for the few people who are just deciding to join us for season three, we're playing a fantasy role-playing game tabletop style. Spencer is the god of our world. We have character sheets with stats and crap on it, and we tell him what we're trying to do. He rolls dice and tells us whether what we wanted to do succeeds or fails. That being said... all: Let's quest! [cheers and applause] - We find our heroes in Goblopolis, the ruined city, two years after the Helling of Earth and the death of Fondue. Our heroes have struggled to survive in this hostile waste. Thousands have fallen under the spell of the Puppet King, who's taken power since the Helling. The dusty towers and crumbled catwalks of Goblopolis are now the prime fortress of the Puppet King. You're traveling with Chadge Zoobag, Fondue's dad, who has discovered this new secret passageway through the ruins. - Chadge? - Listening. - What's your secret about finding secret passages? It seems like I can't walk, you know, 20 miles and not find any passages. You find them like it's no big deal. - Well, since--you know, you knew me back when. I was a fallen half-orc. Now I've found the light in the Stone of Forebearance and have found a born-again sense of revitalization, and this, the Father our Forebear-- Father of the Forebears, we just want to praise you. - Stopped listening. - Okay. I found a doorway, a little crack in this tunnel, and it was sort of a light that shone through even though it was a dark light. I see in negatives and speak in riddles. [chuckles] [laughter] - Chadge, what are all these, uh, pamphlets in your pocket? - Oh, these are "leave behinds." I like to leave a little trail. - Am I a sword? - You sure are, son. You're a sword and a son. - And a ghost. - And a ghost. You're the Holy Trinity. [laughter] - Guys, it's been a wild couple of years. - It really has. - It has. I mean, wowwee. - Remember that--the day with the Marblings of Kipernock? - Ooh. - Yeah. I still got a few scars in my left place. - I'm still... [laughter] I'm still filling out the insurance work on that one. - Do you remember the Battle of Quilted Moments? - What the-- [laughter] - There's that day that Boneweevil just wouldn't stop climbing all those ladders. - Yeah. - What were you trying to find? - I was, uh--I'd just gotten divorced, and... [laughter] - Wow, you guys have had some great times over the years. I've been a long piece of metal with no arms or legs... [laughter] Stuck to my father. - That's right, son. I love having you at my hip. Now, you literally ghosted me, but we-- [laughter] We're bigger than that. We can put that behind us and charge a new relationship. Ain't that right, boyo? - Yeah, our previous relationship was based on separation, and now it's based on... - Well... okay, all right, I didn't know this was gonna be therapy, 'cause if we wanna get to the reality of it, your mother left, she took you, and she went off with that boneheaded Silab Oflox. - [groans angrily] - Oh, hey. - I'm a weapon, and I can't kill myself. [laughter] - [sighs] All right, look. Let's go through this crack and see what life has to offer us. Let's see what Father Forebear has laid in our-- in our walk with him. - Please be a trap. Please be a trap. Spencer: Heading through the narrow gap, you find yourself on a bridge of natural stone that forks three ways, and all three of those ways head towards the main goblin hall, the place the Puppet King is hiding. Goblins, eerily silent, pour out of a darkened gateway onto the narrow bridge, and you can see more goblins leaping off a ledge. - Let's stop pussyfooting around. If it's one thing I learned from religion, it's fight first, ask questions later. [laughter] I grab my son by his short shanks, lift him over my head, summon the Moons of the Three Twins, and charge it full of powerful passion light and the Father of the Forebearance and the Stone of our Sisters and the yearless decades of epoch 12... [laughter] And throw that sword, my son, into the heart of the goblin throws! Spencer: Using your two years of rekindled bonding and combined fighting might, you throw the sword. It knocks four clear off the cliff as it travels like a lightning bolt out over the mountain. - You're supposed to hang on to me! [laughter] - All right, um... - You left me again, Junior! - This is not how abandonment works. - Why would my son do that? - You can't literally throw people and then be the victim. [laughter] Spencer: And the sword-- yeah, it falls off the cliff. - [shouts] [laughter] All--all swords can fly. Are you fucking kidding me? [laughter] Spencer: The goblins attack. [dice clatter] All right. The goblins swarm in and attack you with their rusty weapons. It's pretty easy to dodge them, but a couple get a few hits in. - Uh, well, I'm a barbarian. - Sure. - Yep. - [laughs] And, uh, hey, goblins! Y'all look the same. Let's see if you all... [laughter] [applause] I have no diplomacy. [laughter] - Note taken. - [laughs] I grab my throwing ax. I tie the throwing ax to a rope, just start whipping around the ax in a circle. - You got cleave, right? - Yeah. - All right. - Oh, on here, yes. - Yeah. [laughter] [audience whoops] That's our show. - [laughs] - All right. - You have boobs, right? All right, yes. - You miss, unfortunately. - Oh, no. - The rope kind of is too long, and so it just wraps around a guy's neck, but, like, the ax just hits him in the face rather than, like, slicing through him like a weapon might. - I have something here called Clay Punch, and though I'm hoping that's a party beverage... [laughter] I'm gonna go over and punch a goblin in the chin smacker. [laughter] - All right. [dice clatter] You do that, right in the chin, dealing 20 damage. You punch his head clean off. - Wow. - Jesus Christ. [cheers and applause] - The Father the Bearer and the Holy Sword. - Where we at? - I befriend a lizard. [laughter] Spencer: You find a lizard. Oh, man. He's cool as hell. [laughter] The goblins all attack more. [dice clatter] All right, no. They hit real hard. Jeff takes 13 damage. - Holy smoke. Spencer: And Erin takes 7 as the goblins surround you more. But then a dark tide of shadow catches several goblins in the chest, knocking them off the catwalk. You look to see the source of the magical display and you can see a mysterious stranger cloaked in dark animal furths and leathers. - Ohh. - Whoa. - [shudders] - You look like you needed help. - Oh. - That's right. I came with two characters. - Oh! [cheers and applause] - Are these goblins dispatched? - Oh, so many of them are. In fact, half of them have been, and the rest of them retreat. - Tell us your name, friend. - Mm. For now, I will not do that. - Ooh, he's mysterious, to be sure. - Yes, and will be played by Steven Seagal in the movie. [laughter] - If you must call me something, call me Shadow Seagal. [laughter] Shadow Seagalman. [laughter] - Shadow Seagalman, though you are of a different tribe, can I interest you in some information or pamphlets or "leave behinds" on my newfound glory? - Actually, I came to find the heroes of Earthscar, but it looks like you could use a little help yourselves. - Yeah, but not if you're just gonna come in talking shit. [laughter] - I thought that taking care of a majority of your enemies... - Okay, okay. - Would make it clear that I am no foe. - Okay, I'm sorry. [stammers] "Thank you" is the words I was looking for. - Whoever this puppet master is, I think I'd be happy to help you teach him a lesson in how the only thing thicker than string is chain. [laughter] And I swing my chain weapon around. - Whoa! Whoa! - Rock and roll! - What the fuck? - [laughs] - Holy... - Look at all the different shapes! - [stammers] This is like Cirque du Soleil. - Wow! - Do you see them sparks fly? - Could you help us retrieve-- one of our party is down at the bottom of the mountain here. - It's my son, and he's left me. [laughter] - I understand friendship with weapons... - [sniffs] - As the bond between me and mine... - Are you gonna do it again? - Is chain thick. - Do it again! - Whoa! - [laughs] Do it! [cheers and applause] Fondue! You're missing some serious action up here! - Have you guys considered, uh, just-- just leaving me behind and letting me spin off? [laughter] - How many feet down do you think he is, Spencer? - Oh, like, thousands. - So my 50 foot of rope's not really gonna cut it? - No. - Wait. - You got eternal toilet paper. - Ooh! - But that's-- - Is that strong enough? - No. [laughter] - How many ply? - [laughs] Just two. - [stammers] I saw-- if you take toilet paper and you braid it, it would actually become strong like rope, but it takes, like, four months to do that. - Right. Do you wanna spend the next four months-- - Four months later... - [laughs] - I tie off the-- the infinite toilet paper to the edge of the bridge and start sliding down it to go look. I'm gonna go look for him, you guys. - All right. [dice clatter] You get down to the bottom, and it seems like-- you see hoards of lizard tracks, like, that are shortly after covered. - Fondue! - It seems he didn't wanna be followed. [laughter] - Guys, come on down the rope. Bring the end of that toilet paper. I don't care if it takes four months to find this guy. [laughter] He's our friend. - In the short four months that I've been traveling with you, looking unexpectedly for your lost friend... [laughter] I have gotten to know you well enough to know that chaos is part of your quilt. - Okay, fine. I'm over here. - Ah, I found your friend. [laughter] - Hello, son. - This guy's the best. - Yeah. - Little sword man, were you-- - Staying quiet because I want to die? Yes. - A word of advice to you, friend. A weapon worth using is worth being connected to you, as if a chain... - He's gonna do it. - Oh, God! [cheers and applause] - I got... - Fine, fine. - I thought for sure after the third month, I was gonna get sick of that. I'm not sick of it. - I always do--I always do something a little different. - I know. It's amazing. - Write your name. - [grunting] [laughter] I only hope the Puppet King has not grown in strength. [laughter] - You're on a narrow bridge of natural stone. It has an intersection that forks three ways, all leading towards the goblin hall, where the Puppet King is hiding. - I go down the center path. Spencer: Oh, man. The doors just open. [laughter] - Thank you, Father! [cheers and applause] Let's see stepdaddy do that. Did you see that, son? Follow me. I know the way. Spencer: All right, you enter a chamber. It's large and broken. More than half of it has fallen away, crumbling, just leaving an empty hole in the ground, and on the far side across this hole, you can see a goblin corpse laying on the ground in front of a large bronze door. - What about the other room where it looks-- looks like the laboratory? - It's a bunch of magical equipment. You can see, like, a wizard's cauldron, some, like, magical retorts for alchemy, and some, like, scrolls. You can even see, like-- what do you call it-- a corn husk doll. - Ooh, I run towards the corn husk doll. - You do that! - Cool. I pocket the corn husk doll. Spencer: Picking up the doll, you notice the dead goblin kind of flies up in the air and kind of goes, like, in a big arc. It just jumps up in the air and then falls back on the floor again in time with your movements. - So I take the doll, and I start doing, like, a-- like, a--like, a dance. Spencer: And the dead goblin starts doing a-- like, a grotesque kind of dance. - Kill it. Kill it. Kill the zombie goblin. - [laughs] Come on, guys. And I show them the doll. - Oh, aww. - Aww. - It was me the whole time. Ha! Isn't that funny? - I think we can use it to reanimate this dead goblin to go to the Puppet King and scare him. [laughter] - Just because, I go examine the rest of the laboratory and see if there's anything of value over there. - You find stuff. [dice clatter] - Yeah. - Oh, boy. You find three alchemist's fires and some dry dust and a scroll. - I take the-- I take the dust and the alchemist's fires, but I don't want the scroll because the written word makes me angry. Spencer: Right. [laughter] - I hear you, friend. - Large bronze door. - I take out my crowbar and I try to crow it open. Spencer: Oh, man. Using leverage and your barbarian strength... - [grunting] - You lever open the door. - [yells] [cheers and applause] - It sounded like you had a plan, but you didn't finish saying your plan. - I like the idea of putting the-- my son on the dead goblin and sending him in and he can tell us what he sees. - Mm-hmm. - And I'm doing this voice and you can-- I'll walk ahead of you. Spencer: The door grinds open and the-- the goblin kind of walks through. On the throne, you can see the Puppet King, and he sees--he sees the goblin coming through. He knows--he knows that this is not right because he controls all the goblins. And this is a goblin that he hasn't controlled to do this. - Yeah, but-- - Puppet King, please kill me! Please melt me down! Kill me! I hate my father! I hate my life! Just--just kill me! Spencer: The Puppet King-- - I puppet him to be--to make, like, "just kidding" hands. Like... - Ignore my hands. Kill me! Kill me! - Cross his fingers. - I'm the sword on the back of this goblin. I want to be melted down. [laughter] Spencer: Okay, the gob-- [laughter] The Puppet King dances and cackles like a merry puppet, and one of the many statues in the room, it turns to you and fires a harpoon at the goblin and it just reels it in like a grappling hook and, like, it deposits it into a big hole. - I mean, that is an overreaction. - Yeah. - Yeah, I want to just use a traditional, uh, like, chain hook attack. Can I make that double chains? Let's make that a double. - All right. [laughter] Oh, boy. - [gasps] Spencer: It's a critical hit. [cheers and applause] Dealing 20 damage, you pull him right off of his throne. He's all--he's all up next to you guys, and he's like... - Ha-ha, this was actually one of my tricks. They don't call me the Puppet King for nothing. Spencer: And he turns to Chadge and blasts him with a puppet spell to try and puppet control you. - Uh-oh. Spencer: Oh, it fails. - [laughs] Spencer: Mental magic hits your brain, but your newfound faith has made you strong and resilient. [laughter] [cheers and applause] - I take a second to sing a hymn of praise. ♪ We lift you up ♪ ♪ We see your light ♪ ♪ You Father Forebear us ♪ ♪ Through the night ♪ Amen. - All right, I think that's you, Erin. - Okay, I come running in, wielding my sword and I look to Shadow Seagalman and I say, can I join the chain gang? [laughter] - Nice. - We are family. - Great. And then I... [laughs] And then I go into a barbarian rage, as I'm wont to do, and I start whipping around Only Friend, and I head straight for the Puppet King. [sings Celtic chant] [cheers and applause] Spencer: You hit... [dice rattle] Right in his chest for 18 damage. [cheers and applause] You cleave a large chunk out of his puppet body, and he's got a big wedge like he's a wood that-- like, a log that's being cut mostly in half. - Ha-ha! Marry ya next. [audience oohs] - I walk right up to that Pinocchio-looking motherfucker and I say, you'll never know what it's like to feel like a real boy. [laughter] I'm out of Clay Punches, but I've got a level four Megaton Punch to the lying Pinocchio nose. - Do you-- how much damage does that do? - I'll tell you. - Thank you. - Uh, 8D8. - Oh, shit. [audience whoops] That's a lot. - In an area. - [grunts] - Oh! It's a megaton impact. As a crater forms, an explosion happens! The Puppet King is just obliterated into... [laughter] Into a shower of-- [cheers and applause] Destroyed into a shower of splinters and wood and stone pebbles. - I high-five him and it knocks me all the way across the room. Spencer: As, like-- as the magic that binds his body kind of dissipates, you can hear the shadowy voice kind of go... [spooky voice] They said I could rule you. [normal voice] His treasure is yours for the taking. - Oh, yeah. - Yay. - Oh, look at this. There's a giant pile of treasure back here. - You get 500 gold pieces. You find a bone wand. Oh, and you find-- - Look at this. - This is Goblin Fray the Surging Tide, the goblin relic of heroes and kings, known for always tugging one in the direction of one's ultimate ambitions. - I'm gonna pocket that one. That's my kind of stuff. - Dad! Come down here in this hole. - Don't worry. I've got this. Son, it's time for me to come clean. I've--I've wronged you. I was the one that abandoned you those two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight times. [laughter] But that ninth time, that was all your mom. - Shadow Seagalman closes the cover on the hole that they're in. I am not a man given to deception, except on this one account. I have withheld my identity. - Uh-oh. - Beor O'Shift, I am your brother, Limerick. all: Oh! - [laughs] [cheers and applause] - Limerick? [laughs] I thought you were-- I thought you were dead. - He was dead. - Just start socking him in the mouth. - It's all right. - Okay. - I was resurrected by the barbarian blood priests back home. - Oh. - Hmm, been there. - Our tribe has... [laughter] Our tribe has seen some better days, sister. They've fallen in with demons. - Oh, God. - We must return home to the Skulltree barbarians and save our home from their demonic corruption. Sister, I've-- - Brother. - I've come to take you home. - Is it, like, far? [laughter] - Your friends can help if they desire, but I have no need for them. I came for you. - Right. The thing is, Limerick, I need them, so if you need me, then you need them as well. - In the O'Shift clan, need is important. [laughter] - Also, the last four months, I've been very heavily flirting with you and, um, feel a little grossed out now, a little upset. Kind of wish you would've revealed who you were a bit sooner. - It's my fault. I should've said. It makes sense. Look, there's taboos about incest. I think that they're a little draconian. [laughter] - But would our heroes be able to save the barbarian encampment from their ails? What would happen in the post-apocalypse, and would they be able to survive in this newly helled world? And could Limerick pull off his new headwear? Find out next time on "HarmonQuest." [cheers and applause] - Spencer Crittenden, everybody. - Thanks. - Erin McGathy. Jeff Davis. The magnificent Matt Gourley. I am Dan Harmon. This has been my quest. - [laughs] - We'll see you next episode. Thank you.
