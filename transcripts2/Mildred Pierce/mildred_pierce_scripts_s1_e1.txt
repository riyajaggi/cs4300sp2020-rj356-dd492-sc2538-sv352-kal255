 Mildred Pierce (2011): Season 1, Episode 1 - Part One - full transcript 
 After a fight with her husband, Mildred Pierce finds herself alone and caring for her two young daughters. She hasn't worked outside of the home for several years but is excellent at making pastries and sells cakes and pies to friends and neighbors. She would like to work as a sales clerk or a receptionist but those jobs are hard to come by. She has an interview with a Mrs. Forrester about becoming her housekeeper but it's clear that her pride will not let her take such a low position. She finally realizes - urged on by her friend and neighbor Lucy Gessler - that she'll never get the type of job that she wants and settles for a job as a waitress in a hash house. She begs Lucy never to tell her daughters, especially the elder Veda, of the type of work she does.

 Well, don't think there's much else I can do around here. Might take a little walk down the street. You going to be home for supper? Sure. But if I'm not home by six, don't wait for me. I may be tied up. I want to know. Told you, if I'm not home by six... Well, that doesn't do me any good. Mrs. Whitley's paying three dollars for this cake, and if you're going to be home I'll spend part of that money on lamb chops for your supper. If not, I'll buy something the girls will like better.

 Then count me out. That's all I wanted to know. I fixed up those trees. Cut the grass. Looks pretty nice out there. You going to water the grass? I did water it. Gave it a good wetting down. Most people, when they water the grass, wait till later when the sun's not so hot, and it'll do some good, and not be a waste of good water that somebody else has to pay for. You see any work I can do that I don't do? So you get done early. Come on, Mildred, what are you getting at? She's waiting for you, so go on. - Who's waiting for me? - Ugh!

 I think you know. If you're talking about Maggie Biederhof, I haven't seen her for a week, and she never did mean a thing to me, except somebody to play rummy with when I had nothing else to do. Which is practically all the time, if you ask me. - I wasn't asking you! - So what do you do with her? Play rummy for a while, then unbutton that red dress she's always wearing without any brassiere under it, and then flop her on the bed? And then play rummy some more and then flop her on the bed again? Gee, that must be swell. I can't think of anything nicer than that! How'd you like to go to hell? Ever since you met that woman - useless, do you hear me? Oh, for cryin' out loud! Then tell me I'm wrong. Tell me that's not precisely where you're going! Suppose I am? Then you might as well go pack your bags and leave for good, because if you go out that door, I swear to God, Bert, I'm not letting you back inside! Keep on, Mildred. Keep right on, 'cause one of these days, you don't watch out, I'm calling you! You're not calling me. I'm calling you. You go over there today, Bert, and that's the last you'll see of this place, so help me God. I go where I goddamn please! - Then pack up! - Fine! If that's what you want, okay! Mildred! Oh, hey, honey. He took the car. Who? You mean Bert? Yes, Bert. He's gone. What do you mean? Just now. He just left. He just walked out on you? Just like that? - Maybe he got a little help. - What? For that floppy-looking frump? What did he say? How can he even look at that woman? Oh, what's the use of talking? If she likes him, all right then, she's got him. That wasn't even the reason. And I did pester him, but I just can't take things lying down. I don't care how bad things are. If she can, then fine, because that's just the way he's built. I've got my own ideas and I just can't change them for somebody else. So what are you gonna do? You just joined the biggest army on earth. You're the great American institution that never gets mentioned on the fourth of July - a "grass widow," with two small children to raise on your own. That dirty bastard. Oh, Bert's all right. He's all right, but he's a dirty bastard. They're all dirty bastards. We're not so perfect. Yeah, well, we wouldn't pull what they pull. Not right now. I almost forgot, I fricasseed some chicken for supper but Ike's got a call in Long Beach, so I'm going with him. - I thought it might spoil. - Thank you. Mildred, I don't know how you do it. What? - That cake. It's beautiful! - Hello, dear. - Hello, Mother. How was practice? Hmm, pas extraordinaire. That is, if Chopin's Grande Valse Brillante doesn't give me palsy. - Where's your sister? - Outside. Now what did I say? Mommy! Oh. Uh, the... the Grande Valse... Valse Brillante. Really, Mother. And who, pray tell, is Bob? Here. I had extra batter. Oh, Mother, it's darling! Uh, Bob Whitley. Oh, of course. The paper boy. - Ray! Time to come in! - Mommy, guess what! He'll be a paper boy without a birthday cake if I don't find some way to get it over there. Maybe your grandfather wouldn't mind taking me. Why can't we use our car? Your father's out with it, and he may be late. Oh! What time is it? Richard Crooks is back on The Voice Of Firestone. - He's doing a medley of The Student Prince. - Mommy! Oh, you... you still have time. Mommy, guess what. Mommy, look! I fixed my skates all by myself, and I added string, and now they're not too small anymore! Ray, dear, please be careful around the cake. Ray! I'm just pretending. Look, Mommy, guess who I am. ♪ Swaa-neee! How I love ya, my dear old Swanee Ray, please! ♪ The folks up north will see me no more Sit down. ♪ When I get to that swanee shore ♪ Look. I made you... a special treat. In class, Miss Pinkins said my caterpillar was the most beautiful. Mother, where's Father? He had to go somewhere. Now please, dear, come sit down. Then where are his clothes? He's gone away. Where to? I don't know. Is he coming back? No. No. But why? Why has he gone away? I can't explain it all this instant. Someday you girls will understand. What's important to know is there's nothing to worry about. But... Daddy's... gone? Oh! Oh, it's all right, dear. Hey. I just wanted to know why his clothes were gone. Oh, darling, don't worry. You know... You know your father thinks the world of you girls... but he... he didn't want to say goodbye because... he... he didn't want to upset you or worry you. But it's not his fault. It's no one's fault. It's simply due to things that... that happen. All right? Hmm? If you mean Mrs. Biederhof, Mother, I quite agree. I think she's distinctly middle class. Oh, Veda. Oh. My darling. What would I do without you girls? Hmm? My beautiful, lovely, lovely girls. Aw, cut the mush! Great American institution. Given your age, I'm afraid it's going to be rather difficult to place you. I worked a counter, I can stock goods, Whatever they need, ma'am. I can do it! I'm terribly sorry, but I have a room full of people to get to. If you'll excuse me. Never mind about all them years behind a register. Doesn't mean a damn thing! Why, I've been working since I was six years old. Six years old! At the Abba-Zaba factory! If that don't account for any darn skill... Mrs. Pierce? Receptionist, eh? Sorry, dearie. Just so happens, at the moment, receptionists are out. - Out? - That was then. In those good old days, when even a hockshop had to stick this receptionist thing out there in front to show it had class. Mr. O'Donnell? Well... certainly there are other things I can do. I'm an excellent cook. I sell my own pies and cakes. I wrote down receptionist, but that's not all I can do. Sure it is, or you would have written it on the card. I go by the cards. Stenographers, secretaries, laboratory assistants, nurses, chemists. I mean, some of these girls have PhDs. ScDs. Bookkeepers, salespeople. All laid off. Sitting by their phones, hoping and praying I'll call. I won't call. What I'm trying to tell you is... you haven't got a chance. Okay, let me get that wrapped up for you. Here you go. All right. Anything else I can get for you? Would you like that on the blue side, or... Very good. Next, please. Oh, hi, ma'am, what can I get for you? All right, off to the beach.  I want to get you that inner tube, too. There's Mother! Mommy, Mommy, can we go over to Grandpa and Grandma's house for dinner and sleepover? Can we, Mommy? Please? We thought it'd be nice for the girls, what with everything you've got on your plate. I just bought groceries. Please, Mommy? Say yes. Veda already packed up a case for the weekend. - Well, of course you can, dear. - There! - Thank you, Mommy! - Don't worry, Mother. I brought her slippers and her little bear. So long as you girls are sure to help out. And look after your sister. - All aboard! - Naturally, Mother. You sure Bert didn't put you up to this? Bert? The girls were all alone. Well, have a wonderful time, you two. And mind your grandparents. We will. Bye. Bye, Mother. Bye, darlings. I can't wait to go swimming! Bye! - Simmer down. Well, that was fast. Hello, Mildred. Is Bert around? Wally. Uh... No. Not right now he isn't. Do you know where he went? I don't. All right. Well, um... We had a little trouble over at Pierce Homes over a title. Thought maybe he could help out. Ask him to drop over, will you? Is it... Would there be a fee? We could probably cook up something. Ah. Wally, come in, will you? If it's important, Wally, it might be better you look Bert up yourself. He's... He's not living here anymore. What? He went away. Where? I don't know. I didn't ask. But I'm sure old Mr. Pierce might know, or perhaps... Maggie Biederhof. At least, how to reach him. Well. When did all this happen? Just a few days ago. So you're saying you're busted up for good? Well... yes, as... as far as I know. Well, that's a hell of a note. So what have you been doing with yourself? Oh, I keep myself busy. You don't look busy. The girls are away with their grandparents and I have the day off. You know, I wouldn't ask too much to take it off with you. Never did mind being around you, Mildred. Oh! Well... you certainly kept it to yourself. Me, I'm conscientious. But, say, what are you doing tomorrow night? Well? - Wally Burgan? - Yes, Wally Burgan. Since when was Wally Burgan interested in you? I don't think he ever was. But the second he heard Bert was gone... Well, it was almost funny, the effect it had on him. Yeah, I forgot to mention that. The morals they give you credit for, you'd be surprised. To him, you were a red-hot mama the second he found out. Found out what? Grass widow! From now on, honey, you're fast. - Are you serious? - I am. And they are. So how'd you leave it for tomorrow? Well, he's picking me up at seven and taking me out somewhere. All right. See, there's mistake number one. First thing, I wouldn't let that cluck buy your dinner. No, I would sit him right down and give him one of those Mildred Pierce specials, - just like... - What? Me work, - when he's willing to take me out? - As an investment, baby! Now shut up and let me talk. Why do you suppose he wants to take you out someplace? To show respect? To prove his high regard for you? Malarkey! They take us out for one reason and one reason only. To get a drink. Them. And, baby, right there is where I come in. - Come with me. - What? Now? Now this stuff, the gin and the Scotch, is right off the boat, but it's legit, wherever Ike got it from. And it's A-1. Now the other stuff, the wine, is from right here in California, but it's okay booze, so lean on it. That's the trick, baby. You handle the wine right and the high-priced stuff will last and last. Now, what are you serving? Who says I'm serving anything? Baby, baby. You go out with him and he buys you dinner, and you get a little tight, and you come home and something happens. Don't worry. Nothing'll happen. Of course something'll happen, eventually. And when it happens, it's sin. It's sin because you're a grass widow and fast, and he's all paid up because he bought you dinner. That makes it square. But if you bought his dinner, and cooked it for him the way you do, and just happened to look cute in that little apron, and something just happened to happen... well, that's just nature. Old mother nature, baby, and we all know she's no bum. And Wally's not paid up. Not even close. Anyway, last I heard you were up against it. Play your cards right, and within a month he'll be taking you shoppin' for a divorce! So, you really think I want to be kept? Yes. My goodness! It's really coming down! You ready to go? You mean in this? Well, it's what we said, isn't it? It's just so awful out. Why don't I fix you something here tonight? - We can go out some other time... - Hey, hey, hey, I'm taking you out. Holy smokes. I had no idea, Mildred. Oh! I thought the hired girl did all the cooking. Oh! Goodness. A hired girl. Not me. Plate's a little hot. Oh! Mildred, that was something. The pie! Well, that's another thing you might have noticed, all the times you've been over here. I don't know how much of a bartender I am, but I'm an awfully good cook. And the gin! I haven't had real gin since... God knows when. All they serve in these speaks is smoke and a guy's taking his life in his hands, to boot. Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I feel a chill. As soon as the cook gets these dishes out of sight... she's gonna put on a warmer dress. You need any help? I could see giving those apron strings a pull. You do and I might just put it on you, make you do the dishes. I thought you might need a little help. I don't need help. And I didn't ask you to come in here. Jesus. Gosh, I'm sorry, Mildred. I... I just come in to pull on those apron strings, you know, as a gag. I wouldn't pull any cheap tricks on you. Oh! Mmm! Yeah. Oh! There. Wait a sec. Over here. Oh. Oh! Don't move. Don't move! Don't move. Penny? Uh... Nothing, really. Just thinking about Bert. Bert? What's there to think about him? Bert's a good friend. A goddamn good friend. Well, that's rich. Not to me, it's not. A good friend. But not so goddamn good that you wouldn't block him out of a job he was entitled to, then go around playing politics so you can get it for yourself. It was Bert who started Pierce Homes, you may recall. Bert owned farmland. The developers came knocking. He got lucky, that's all. Anyway, it's no good cussing, Mildred, coming from you. Well, double-crossing's no good, coming from anybody. I don't like that. I don't care whether you like it or not. They needed a lawyer. After you talked to them they did! Oh yes, at least a dozen people came to Bert and... warned him what you were doing and begged him to go down and put his claim in, but he wouldn't do it. He didn't think it was proper. Till he found out what was proper, and what a pal you were. That's... Mildred, I swear to you, I give you my word! What's that worth, exactly? Why don't you tell the truth, Wally? You've gotten what you came for, haven't you? A drink, a dinner... some things I'd prefer not to mention. And now you want to duck, so you start talking about Bert. Funny how you didn't talk about Bert when you came in here, wanting to pull those apron strings. You remember them, don't you? - I didn't hear you saying no. - No, I was a sap! And you're just like all the rest! I'm sorry, Wally. No, hell, it's all right. - I've been a little upset lately. - Who wouldn't be? Say, doll! How'd it go last night? Well... I'm on the town. Yeah? How's it feel? Fast. Figueroa and Sixth. Watch your step. There will be some dames coming up from the notice I posted downstairs. Eighth floor. Tea room. More tea? Certainly. Thank you. You here for the job? No, I was... No. Going down. Coming up next on the KFI music hour is Johann Strauss's... Mrs. Whitley? It's Mildred Pierce. Did you not receive the check we posted? No, nothing like that. I just hadn't heard and was wondering if you wanted your usual order for next week or... - Uh, no, Mrs. Pierce, I'm afraid not. - I can do it! I can do it! We've had a very busy month or I would have phoned. Okay. No, certainly. But I'll be sure and let you know next time around. You know where to find me. All right. Ray, please. - Thank you. - Good-bye. Bye now. Shoot. What is it, Mother? Nothing, dear. Everything's fine. Mother, I wish you wouldn't worry so. I just know everything's gonna work itself out, I know it will. Remember? "Do your duty and a little more and the future will take care of itself." Aw, cut the mush. Now what? Veda, finish up, then help your sister gather her school things. - It's quarter past. - Yes, Mother. - Hello? - Mrs. Pierce? - Yes? - It's Mrs. Turner calling. - I don't know if you remember... - Mrs. Turner! Mm! - You left your card with me. - Of course I remember. From the employment agency. - Something just came up. - It did? - If you had a moment to stop by. - Uh, of course, certainly. I'll be there as soon as... I will. Thank you, Mrs. Turner. - All right. - Thank you. You see? Yes. Now... Hurry up and finish, you two. You're going to be late for school. The agency doesn't normally handle domestic help, so this one's strictly off the books. I was over in Beverly the other night and I got talking to this lady that's gonna marry this director. He doesn't know it yet, but his house is in for a big shake-up. So... she needs a housekeeper. And on account of all that fine domestic efficiency you were telling me about, I told her about you. Oh! Well, I hardly know what to say. You see, I recently came across a similar job, as... a waitress, and I... And you turned it down? Well, I mean, I... I couldn't. I... I just can't go home and... face my children, knowing their mother works all day at taking tips and wearing a uniform, and mopping up crumbs. But you can face them just fine when there's nothing left to eat? That will never be the case, Mrs. Turner. I'd... I'm extremely grateful that you thought of me, though I can't see why you did. And, certainly, I'll go over there, as a courtesy to you. What have I got to do with it? You either you want it or you don't. Listen. I've got my own little business, sure. But if that went bust and I had to choose between my belly and my pride, I'm telling you right now, I'm picking my belly every time. You want to know why I recommended you? Sure, you've got a head on your shoulders and a good physique. But you let half your life slip by without anything but sleeping, cooking and setting the table, and lo and behold, that's all you're good for. So get over it. - Housekeeper? - Yes, I was sent by... Back door. Mrs. Forrester will be with you shortly. How do you do? I'm Mrs. Forrester. How do you do? It's customary, Mildred, for the servant to sit on the mistress's invitation... not on her own initiative. It's perfectly all right, but on little things, especially with an inexperienced woman, I find it well to begin at the beginning. Do sit down. We've many things to talk about, and it'll make me quite uncomfortable to have you standing there. This is all right. Mildred... I invited you to sit down. Now... as the employment agency people no doubt informed you, Mr. Lenhardt and I are to be married next month, and I am determined to bring this mausoleum of his into the 20th century. And I shall need a highly capable person to take charge of the plans. Now... private quarters are above the garage, around back, and your daughters are welcome to come and live with you there. I, myself, have two children from my previous marriage, though, of course, fraternization between the children would not be permitted. I don't foresee a problem, though, seeing as you'd have your own entrance on the lane, and, whatever the case, any such concerns can certainly be taken care of. I don't think I'm quite the person that you want here, Mrs. Forrester. I beg your pardon? I don't think I'm quite the person for the job. If you'll excuse me. The mistress terminates the interview, Mildred. "Mrs. Pierce," if you don't mind. And I'm terminating it. - Harris will show you out. - I'll find my way. Nine have been arrested for attacking white girls! Read all about it! Get your Times here for five cents! Riot feared in Scottsboro, Alabama! Nine have been arrested for attacking white girls! Read all about it! Get your Times here! Only a nickel. Extra! Extra! Read all about it! Riot feared in Scottsboro, Alabama! Nine arrested for attacking white girls! I'll just get a ham sandwich with lettuce, a glass of milk, - and please, just as soon as... - Coming right up. Here you go. Thank you. What I hear is we're coming out of it. Things are turning around. Next year, we'll be back where we were. Wheels of industry rolling again. I don't know what newspapers you're reading, pal. The Times, the Chronicle... all the editorial pages say the same. Check the crime blotter. That's where the real news is. Well, they say next year at the latest. Word on the street says different. - I don't see the big fuss. - Oh, you didn't care for it? Well, it's no Flesh And The Devil, anyway. I just think she's heaven on screen. I could watch her sleep. Oh, Garbo snores! Boys, the usual? I hear the soup's good today. Yeah. Hold on. You! You dirty little crook! I caught you red-handed! I caught you right in the act! - I didn't do anything! - I caught her! She's been doing it right along, she's been stealing tips off my tables! She stole 10 cents off table 18, right after that lady sat down, and just now she stole 15 off a 40-cent tip right under my nose and I seen her do it! All right! Quiet down, both of you! We got no time for this! Ida, what the hell do you call this? - Anna says she caught... - Doris is stealin' my tips! ...Doris glommin' tips. - I just seen her steal off of table 14. That's it. Both of you, you're fired! - What? I didn't do nothin'! - What? Mr. Chris! Oh, no? You turn my place into boxing ring! That's it! You are out! No! That's so unfair! I don't need this kind of treatment. The nerve! Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for such commotion, okay? - Please? - And then? We got two waitresses gone, we got a whole lunch train. What do you expect me to... Mr. Chris, we don't have time for this. - Girls! Please! You're not helping us! - Get out. Get out! Somebody get out now. Anna's a good waitress, you just can't let her go. Me? I got my hands full. I'm telling you, Mr. Chris, this is not the way. Who are you gonna put on now? You've gotta put somebody on! It's a mess out there! Yes, because everybody is here, ignoring their tables. I'm telling you, Mr. Chris, this is a lunch train. You gum up the tracks, you lose. What's this? Oh, you mean to tell me she's here to take over from me? - Oh, no! Nothing doing! - Who is she? No way does Anna get the boot for some ankle off the street. If it wasn't for Anna, we'd all be getting... - our tips nicked. - Wait a minute! You. You here to work? Well... - yes, if you... - That's it, I'm quits! No way am I staying with her! You gonna drag in some dame off the streets... Okay, Okay, cut the hoo-ha! Anna and the new girl stay. Now go, go, go! Go! - Thank you very much. - Go, go. - Follow me. - Go. Go! Liver and onions, thank you, gentlemen... Study that while I find you something. Prices specially. - What size you wear? - Oh. Ten. You ever work in a restaurant? No. Is that your chicken or my chicken? That's my chicken. Your uniform comes off the first check. Three ninety-five, and you keep it laundered. The pay is 25 cents an hour, and you keep your own tips. And what's your name, miss? Ida. Yours? Mildred Pierce. I'm giving you a light station, see? Tables one through six. That's so's you don't get no fours. - Singles and twos are easier. - Miss? Hello? Now, all them that's just come in, you take them, I'll cover the others. Come on. Now you show, after two stiffs, one goose cursing at me non-stop and two fours about to torch the place! So here you mark your number. You're number nine. Here you mark the number of the table, and here the number of customers on the check, and down here, everything they order. Now, you got to account for every check, see? If you make a mistake, it's deducted, and you got to pay for it. Got it? - Got it. - Go. Looks like nobody wants our money. Oh, here she comes. We'll see if there's even time. I have no idea. - Can I help you? Well, we're not sure we're having anything at all. What kind of place is this, anyway? Letting people sit around and not even asking them if they minded waiting? It's been, uh... a little trouble earlier, but if you could just be patient for a moment, I'll see that you're served at once. The roast chicken is awfully good today. Well, then. I'll have the 67-cent lunch with chicken. I'll do the same. But see to it that there's no gravy on mine in any way, shape or form. I hate brown gravy. Yes, miss. I'll remember. I bet you ten dollars she puts brown gravy on mine. The train was derailed, boys, but we're chugging again. Two roast chicken. One without gravy. "Hold" one gravy. "Hold" it. You gotta call it right! You can't work nowhere without you're in good with the chef. You gotta call it right for him. Never "without," always "hold." Yes, miss. Hold! Pick up your starters. Pick up your starters! Have they got water? Uh, not yet. Oh, for crying out loud. Okay, get in there. Well... can I have a tray? Get the soup! The soup! She's new. Very new. Good work, January. Pick up something. Don't never make a trip in or out without something in your hand. Grab that! - Excuse me, miss. - One moment. Mildred. You're short 35 cents on table five. What? Personally, Mildred, I don't think you're suited for it. And Mr. Chris was not a bit impressed. But the chef thinks you'll do, so we're giving you a trial. Well, please thank Archie for me and tell him I hope I won't disappoint him. Your hours are 11:00 in the morning, 10:30 if you want breakfast, to 3:00 in the afternoon. We don't do a big dinner train, but most girls are on call twice a week, five to nine, same wages as daytime. And we're closed Sundays. You'll need white shoes. Ask for nurses' regulation, any of the stores, 2.95. What's the matter, Mildred? You don't want the job? I'm a little tired, is all. I don't wonder, the way you trot. Hold still, Ray! I can't do it if you keep squirming! 'Cause it's hurting! Mrs. Gessler, do you know the name of Catherine Earnshaw's immortal beloved in Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights? I can't say I do, Veda. It's quite famous. Will you girls be all right while I speak to Mrs. Gessler? Yes, Mother. Now hold still. He phoned around 9:00, saying he had a hurry call that might keep him out. Didn't see him till 10:00 this morning. Sure, all in his line of business, but just the same. Lucy, can I borrow $3? More, if you want. No. Thanks. I just need a few things. I've taken a job. A job? What kind ofjob? Just a job. Then I hope for your sake you picked a $5 house and not a two. I'm a waitress. In a hash house. Sort of rhymes up the same way. Just about. That's funny. And I know it's none of my business, but all that time you were answering those ads, trying to get hired on as a saleswoman, receptionist, whatever it was, I kept wondering to myself why you didn't try something like this. Why? Suppose you did get a job as a saleswoman. Who's buying any goods? You'd be standing around some store all day, just waiting for the chance to make a living and never making it. People eat, though. Even now. It might sound funny, but, at selling, I'd say you weren't the type. But at this, I don't know why... Mildred. Oh, no! Oh, honey, just let it come. Let it come. - I can't do it, Lucy. I just can't. Do what? Wear a uniform. Take their tips. Face those awful people. They call me names! One of them... One of them grabbed me, put his hand clear up... clear up... - What do they pay you? - 25 cents an hour. - And tips extra? - Mm-hm. Baby, you're nuts. Those tips will bring in a couple of dollars a day, and before you know it, you'll be making fifteen, twenty dollars a week, at least. More money than you've seen since Pierce Homes blew up. You've got to do it, for your own sake. Nobody pays attention to that uniform stuff anymore. I bet you look cute in that uniform. Besides, people have to do what they can... No, Lucy, stop! I'll go mad. I'll... That's what... That's what everyone's been telling me, the employment people, everybody, that... that all I'm good for is waiting tables and putting on a uniform. And maybe they're right. Because maybe what they're trying to tell you is what I'm trying to tell you. You're in a spot. You're starving to death, baby. Don't you suppose my heart's been heavy for you? Don't you know I'd have brought a roast beef in here, or a ham, whatever I had, every night of the week, except I knew you'd hate me for it? Oh, honey, you've just got to take this job. I know it. I can't... ...but I've got to. And if you've got to, you've got to, so quit bawling. Hmm? Lucy, promise me one thing. - Promise you won't tell a soul. - Hell, I won't even tell Ike. I don't care about Ike, or any of these people, what they think. It's on account of the children. The chance of them finding out. I just... I just can't have them knowing anything about it. Veda in particular. Veda, if you ask me, has some funny ideas. You don't understand her, Lucy. No, she has something in her that... that I thought I had, and now find I don't. Pride, or nobility... or whatever it is. That pride? I wouldn't give a snap of my finger for it. But you're right about her. Veda wouldn't do it herself, but she's willing to let you do it and eat the cake. That's what I want, for both of them. Not just bread. All the cake in the world.
