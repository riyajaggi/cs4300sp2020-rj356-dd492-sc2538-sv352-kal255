How are you? ♪♪ [Sighs] ♪♪ I'm in the sanatorium in Trentino. It's in Italy. It's called Himmelstal. It's way up in the mountains. You'd really like it here, Hel. Hel, I'm sorry about Dad's funeral... and about David. I-I just want us to be together again. I'd really love it if you could, you know, maybe come and visit me. I sent you a postcard and directions and everything. Did you get it? I'm telling you, this place is spectacular. There is even a lake, like back on the farm. It makes me think of you. Please, just come and see me. I miss you. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Telephone rings] Hi, my name is Helena. This is International Technical Support. How can I help? ♪♪ Yeah, I'm sorry. You're going to have to call back. Helena... you can't just hang up in the middle of a call. The night bus doesn't wait.

It makes me think of you. ♪♪ I'd really love it if you could, you know, maybe come and visit me. ♪♪ Brant, you're supposed to be here 20 minutes early in case there's a briefing. That's the rules.

You know, sometimes I wonder if you really want this job enough. You need to show me that you really want this. Mm. I mean, there's a lot of people that would kill to get this job. What are you doing? You know what? I don't... I don't feel so well. What? You can't just leave. No, you just started. Yeah, I can. It's the rules. ♪♪ ♪ Please ♪ Set me free ♪♪ ♪ There's a light that waits for me ♪ ♪ Somewhere ♪♪ ♪ Please ♪ Look at me ♪ I am more than what you think ♪ ♪ You see ♪♪ ♪ Open your heart to all that ♪ You once had thought could never be ♪ ♪♪ ♪ Please ♪♪ [Birds chirping] Only way in or out of the sanctuary. Bye. Thank you. [Car door closes] Ms. Brant. Hi. Obviously. Do you speak English? Yes. Good. Please, come on in. [Engine starts] This is Jerefo, head of security. There's no question who youare. Welcome. Thanks. Uh, Dr. Fisher would normally greet you and have a little chat with you about your sister, but he sends his apologies. He's not available today. You'll have to make do with me. May I have a look in your bag? It's just to check for drugs or alcohol, that kind of thing. Okay. Thank you. Spread your arms and legs, please. Thank you. [Metal detector beeps] You was in the military? No. It... it belonged to a friend. Oh, okay. Good to go. Thank you. This way. [Beeping] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ "Himmelstal" means "heavenly valley," our own slice of heaven. It seems so clean. It's... It's beautiful. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ That's the bird's-eye view, the sanatorium, those cabins in the village. Everything within the secure perimeter is part of the sanctuary. Over here. Woman: Yes. No problem. Have a good day. Bye-bye. Miss Brant, we've been expecting you. Welcome to Himmelstal. Thanks. Your sister has arranged for you to stay with her in her cabin. I hope you will feel very comfortable here. I'm sure I will. This is all lovely. Just a couple more things. Here is a map of the valley. You'll see two different zones for various levels of patients, but don't worry. Your thumbprint will give you access to all areas. Everybody loses key cards. Never lose your thumbs. [Chuckles] [Scanner beeping] Okay, and photo. [Camera shutter clicks]Perfect. One last thing is your passport and your phone. Phones are not allowed in the valley. It's okay. We keep it in a safe deposit box. Okay. If you need to use it, please, just come back here, check the messages, and make your calls from here, okay? And if I... Siri: Hey! [Chuckles] ♪♪ ♪♪ I... I... I didn't think you'd come. Neither did I. How are you? Good. Yeah? [Clears throat] I'm going to leave you ladies to it. Your thumbprint is your open sesame. Thanks. Have a great stay. ♪♪ [Scanner beeps] ♪♪ [Laughs] Hey. ♪♪ Here. I-I'll help you with your bag. Oh, I... it's fine, thanks. Okay. So we're not speaking Swedish. Oh, my God, no. I hate Sweden. Come on. ♪♪ [Chatter] Hello. Sorry about all the security here. They take it way too seriously. ♪♪ Siri... what is this place? I know. Sometimes, it feels like the place was founded by Nazi hippies. Yeah. ♪♪ So, Siri, you still haven't told me why you're here. Oh, hey, puppy![Dog barks] No, don't be like that. Aw, that's a good boy. Good boy. [Dog barking] Good boy. Siri. Shit! Fucking dog. They keep saying they're going to catch it and get rid of it, and it never fucking happens. ♪♪ Come on. ♪♪ ♪♪ Hello. Hi. Morning. This is it... home sweet home. ♪♪ Hi, Margot. This is my sister, Hel. Well, Rose-Red and Snow-White, eh? [Scanner beeps]Like a fairy tale. Magical? Grim. She's English. [Birds chirping] Oh, yeah, you can put your stuff there. [Chuckles] Do you like it? Yeah. It's cool, right? But, Siri, how can you afford all this? Real estate. In America? No, here in Italy. I haven't been back to the States since Mom died, so I've been selling villas to Russians looking for somewhere warm to stash their cash. Turns out I'm good at sales. [Chuckles] So all these years I've been worrying about you, you've been doing well? No, I've been messing up my life very badly. It doesn't look like the kind of place you end up if you mess up badly. Well, a gilded cage is still a cage. Look, they don't take you in here if you're not serious about changing yourself, and Dr. Fisher... He will not let me out until I'm clean, sober, and stable. So that's why you're here... To get sober? Yeah, I had to. Had to? Why? Um, parole condition. ♪♪ Those couple of years... [Sighs] I've been in prison. ♪♪ Prison? Why? ♪♪ I nearly killed someone. It was a car accident. I'd been drinking. You could have told me. I was too ashamed. ♪♪ It was a kid, Hel, a kid on a bicycle. ♪♪ [Sighs] Come on. Let's go to the lake. Margot has got ears like a bat. [Birds chirping] Siri: You ever wonder how we would have turned out if we'd been kept together, living in the same country, you know, being normal twins, getting up to stuff, stealing each other's boyfriends... instead of each just growing up in an untenable domestic milieu. An untenable domestic... [Chuckles] It's not my words. It's Dr. Fisher's. Maybe it was Dr. Silva's, can't remember. He's my day-to-day shrink. So they helped you change. Who said I changed? You just said that you were ashamed. That's a new color for you. Or was it being in jail that changed you? Jail doesn't change anything. You know, it's... it's not that fairy tale. It's the other fairy tale... the one about true love. If the old me had heard me say it, I would've laughed my ass off. Who is he? Well... sheis called Graziela. She's very strong, very gentle... very calm. ♪♪ And she's a woman. I know. [Chuckles] It... It... It shocked the hell out of me, too. I... For everything you said about gays. I know. I'm not proud of the old me. ♪♪ [Sighs] Come on. ♪♪ Do you remember on our 9th birthday when, um, Mom put the cake on a chair with a cloth on... [Laughs] ...and Dad walked in, and he sat on it [Laughs] in his best pants? [Chuckles] Oh, God, and they thought you were crying. We were just laughing so hard, we had tears. Well, it was funny, [Scoffs] and it was princess torte. Yeah, you never liked princess torte. Always [Speaks indistinctly] every year. Well, only a pervert likes green marzipan. ♪♪ [Bird squawking] ♪♪ So, this Graziela... Where did you meet? ♪♪ Um... we met in jail. She was a volunteer. She came and taught handicrafts twice a week. She's the reason why I'm here trying to be better. [Sighs] I think she's my... my David. ♪♪ ♪♪ Siri, why did you ask me here? The thing is that... Don't give me the thing, Siri. Give me the straight version. That way, we can get to the bit where I say no so much quicker. ♪♪ I need help... getting out. I need to see Graziela just for one day... [Scoffs] ...because she's in the hospital in Milan. She... She had a termination, and, uh... it went badly. An abortion? She had a husband. ♪♪ And? And he heard she had taken up with a woman, so he went... and he raped her. Fucking prince, right? ♪♪ [Sighs] I just want to see her, Hel. I made a career out of not showing up. I mean, Dad's funeral was just one of a long list, right? Well, just tell the people here, then. I don't know. Ask for a day of compassionate leave or something. They're not going to let me out until I'm better. It's condition of my parole. So I thought of you. ♪♪ I thought that you could just be me... here... for one day. ♪♪ Forget it. No, Hel, listen. I walk out as you. You stay here as me, just for one day. I... If I can get a taxi at 9:00, I... I can be in Milan in three hours or so, just see Graziela, see her, let her know that... That I'm there for her, and I return here as you, and then we swap back. All you have to do is act like you're at a resort. No! ♪♪ Okay. Hear me out, okay? Look, I've written it all out. The whole routine... What to do, what not to do, and how to be me for a day. Look, no. Siri, no. I'm not going to do any of it. I will go with you to the authorities and, you know, help make your case. They won't listen to you. They might. Sure. ♪♪ Fuck it. I got to pee. Siri. ♪♪ [Whirring] ♪♪ [Animal squealing] ♪♪ Siri? ♪♪ Siri? ♪♪ ♪♪ Do you want to stroke it? Siri? Why are you shouting your name? Fuck are you doing, creep? ♪♪ Why are there two of you? [Scoffs] Piss off. She could kick your ass. She won championships at ass-kicking. Siri, ease up. Let's just go. Fine. Thanks, Raymond. We were having a nice day. Everybody hates Raymond. ♪♪ Would you like some tea? Yeah, why not? I have fresh mint. You got mail. Oh! So I thought we could eat down in the cafeteria. It's a bit sketchy, but... ♪♪ Siri, what happened? [Breathing heavily] [Door closes] ♪♪ [Water running] ♪♪ Siri. ♪♪ Hey. [Voice breaking] Just go away. [Crying] ♪♪ Oh, my God, the tattoo. Is this...? Who sent this? Who do you think? Her husband. He must have found her and wanted me to know it. I'm so sorry. I need to see her. She needs to see me. I understand that. So you'll do it? You'll switch with me? ♪♪ Siri, I can't. It's... It's... We're going to go to reception, and we're going to get something done about this. We're going to talk to whoever is in charge, okay? We're going to work it out. ♪♪ I'm sorry. It's after hours. Well, this is an emergency, okay? I'd like to speak to whoever is in charge of this place. Dr. Fisher? Right. Can you call him? Dr. Fisher isn't available. Look, we just... We just want to see if she can get a compassionate leave to see a friend. I'm sure it won't be allowed. Well, perhaps I can talk to somebody. I can page Mr. Redpath. Not... Not Redpath. Siri. No, just leave it. Just leave it. Let's just go and eat. [Chatter] Hey. You okay? Not... Not feeling great. [Sniffles] What's wrong with Mr. Redpath? He seemed like a nice guy. He's not a nice guy. He's not even a doctor. He's security. It'd be like throwing yourself at the mercy of the gestapo. Just come with me in the morning and talk to Dr. Silva. He's our best bet. He'll be back tomorrow. [Sighs] I'm done. [Crickets chirping] [Alarm blaring] What's that? Ah, just curfew warning. [Scoffs] Hi, Siri. Everything is all right? Everything is all right. Good night, then. Sweet dreams. [Scanner beeps, door opens] Thanks. Mmm, it's nice. [Scoffs] Don't you ever get bored at being the good one? I get bored at pretty much everything these days... or exhausted. It was just exhaustion. Sometimes, it's hard to tell the difference... but the truth is... When you called... I don't even know... if Graziela is alive or dead, but I do know she's been hurt, and she's alone because I'm trapped here, unable to get to her, and it's breaking my heart. And you want me to sympathize with you because you're a bit bored? I'd love to be a bit bored. I'd fucking love not to be terrified. I'd love not to feel guilty or gutted, imagining what she's going through. Siri. [Sighs] I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Come on. [Sighs] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Laughing] ♪♪ Siri? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Siri. ♪♪ Are you in here? Hello? ♪♪ ♪♪ Fucking bitch. ♪♪ My stuff, shit. ♪♪ [Indistinct conversation] Hi. Hi. Um, is... Is there a phone in number 40? No, Siri. Your sister picked it up on her way out. Man: Hey, Officer, watch where you put your hand. If you need to make a phone call, you can use the phones. They're free. Over there? Yeah. [Conversation continues] ♪♪ Okay. Do you understand this? If you read it, you understand? [Beep] Hi, this is Hel. Please leave a message. [Beep] You fucking bitch. You just went and did it anyway? You take my phone and my passport, too? You know I could just fucking step out of here and... And screw you over right now. There are actually fucking police in here. Maybe they could send people over to Milan and pick you up. ♪♪ Shit, Siri. Okay. Here is how it's going to be. You go ahead and deal with your shit, but if you're not back by sunset, I'm blowing your cover. I'm not spending another night here, okay? And however much extra time you spend in jail, that's your fucking fault, not mine. Got it? I really fucking hope so because I'm not joking. ♪♪ Asshole. ♪♪ [Sighs] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Sighs] ♪♪ ♪♪ Your sister left very early. Did you quarrel? No. Hel... funny name, eh? Do you know what Jean-Paul Sartre said? No. "Hell is other people." ♪♪ [Chuckles] ♪♪ ♪♪ Hello, Siri. Have you seen Svala? Svala? Yeah, Svala Inberg. She's not in the cabin. No, haven't seen her. Ah, thank you. ♪♪ ♪♪ Hey. ♪♪ [Dog whimpering] Hi. Come here. ♪♪ Hey. You're not so bad, right? Hey! What did you do with Luck, huh? Sorry? The dog. What did you do? Why isn't he barking at you? I don't know. I-Is he yours? Nah, it's Father Block's dog, and it knows what you've done. You've changed it. I-I-I just stroked him, and now... Now I'm stopping, okay? [Dog barks] Leave him alone, okay? ♪♪ [Chatter] ♪♪ [Birds chirping] [Bell tolling] [Indistinct conversation] [Whirring] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hey, stranger. Hi. Ooh, I thought the salad bar was more your thing. I... I thought I'd try the schnitzel. Ah, okay. Did you bring it back? What? Don't play games, Siri. You said you'd get it right back to me. I could pick it up later if you felt like... you know... [Chuckles] Ma-Maybe another time. Okay, well, if you're in thatmood, forget it. [Chuckles] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Vehicle approaching] ♪♪ Man: Watch out, please. ♪♪ Hey, Siri. We found Svala Inberg. Road's closed for now. You're not allowed to go up there. Oh, okay. Yes. Yeah, we found her right below the cliffs. Must have fallen off the cliff and been lying there day and night. Christ. This is a giant goat fuck. Oh, yeah, seems like her face hit every rock on the way down. Alright. Get back up there and see if you can see what she was doing. We're going to go through the CCTV, find out how she got up there without us noticing. Copy that. I'm going to call Fisher, tell him the good news. He's not going to like this. Hi, this is Hel. Please leave a message. [Beep][Sighs] Siri, this not as easy as you said it would be. ♪♪ [Sighs] Just to be clear, sunset means sunset, okay? If you're not here by curfew, too bad.

Margot: Me, too. 12 hours' fast and test on an empty stomach, my idea of bloody heaven. Please, get me this Dr. Fisher. I need to speak to him. Siri, you seem a little tense. I'm not Siri. I'm her sister, okay? We swapped, and she went to see her girlfriend. And I don't know what's happened. Okay, you want to calm down. No, I want to speak with the authorities. Calm down, hm? Why are you not listening to me when I'm talking? Ah! [Gasps] I think we better take you in for testing, too, Siri. I'm not Siri. ♪♪ Hey, don't provoke them. I'm not. If they get any more pissed, they won't let me smoke. If I don't smoke, I get cranky. Ugh, seriously? [Door rattling] What are you doing? Health and safety. If I don't get a little smoke, it's not going to be healthy or safe in here. I'd offer you one, but I don't like you. [Lighter clicks] ♪♪ [Flames crackling] ♪♪ Hey! Wake up. Hey! ♪♪ Help!
