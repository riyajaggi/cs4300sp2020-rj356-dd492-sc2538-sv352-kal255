 Your sister, Helena... I'm afraid she didn't make it. Redpath: Siri fooled us. She escaped. You're going to keep your mouth shut because right now, there are only three people that know about this. We're going to keep it that way. Helena: Who are you? Tatania, queen of the fucking fairies? I'm Jane Taylor. I'm a psychiatrist. You want to find a way out of this place? Follow me. She believes your bullshit story?

 Like every girl I meet. ♪♪ [Water bubbling] Jane. Martin. You used the safe word. Why? Because she's not Siri, Martin. She's the bloody sister. That's impossible. Martin, do you think I'd jeopardize nearly four years undercover if I wasn't sure? Okay. Convince me. Well, she's behaving very differently. She's displaying normal human responses. The whole affect is different, the opposite of flat.

 She's being empathetic. She's behaving unselfishly. But has it occurred to you that her change in behavior could be the result of our program finally working? Or maybe she's learning to mimic normal relationships. No, she's not mimicking, Martin. How do you know? Because of 37 years of experience in the field. [Muffled conversation] Ray-Ray went too far. It has nothing to do with me. That's the truth. [Scoffs] The truth. Hand to God, kiddo. Now, come on. Give us a smile and say we're friends, hmm? I don't give a shit about us being friends 'cause I'm getting out of this place. I'm not Siri. I'm her sister. And you want to remove that fucking hand, or I'll break your fingers. ♪♪ You're telling me you're the sister, and you think I'mthe one who's fuckin' nuts? Well, it doesn't matter. As soon as that door opens, I'm out, free, and you're still in here, fucked. And then... there's the dog. The dog? Yes, the dog. Block's dog hated her, and she hated it. It was mutual. And now, suddenly, they are inseparable. Jane, she can pretend to like the dog. But the dog can't pretend to like her. Why is everyone so obsessed with this stupid dog? Who's everyone? Silva? And has he noticed the same things? Well, that's two of us, Martin. It's just so impossible. I mean, Redpath checked her out with her thumbprint. Yes, I know, I know. And all systems are theoretically perfect until you get people involved. Jane, if we made a mistake like this, it would be the end of everything we're trying to create here. Are you scared? Scared? No. Well, you should be because if I'm right, and I am, we have falsely imprisoned an innocent woman and let a violent psychopath get out. What do you think we should do? Call the police. Get them to come and take her thumbprint. See if matches the one they have on file for Siri. Come on, Martin, one simple empirical test, not conjecture, not emotion, not the behavior of a dog. Right. Um... I'll be right back. I'm... I'm... I'm going to get Silva, bring him in on this. Okay. ♪♪ [Door opens] ♪♪ You know how screwed Fish will be if one of his lab rats got out of the maze? That's not my problem. No, it's his. If Siri escaped, I would fuckin' love that. I like to mess with the hippie bastard, but if she got out, he's gone. [Cellphone rings] It's about time, you slippery loaf. H-Hang on. Hang on. How stupid do you think I am? I saw the papers. So? What? [Cellphone beeps] Are you shitting me? ♪♪ No, I think we're fine. Thank you. We've got a problem. ♪♪ First, don't start saying "we" for a problem you created. Second, I don't have room for another problem because one of my embedded researchers knows. What? And when she finds out that not only did you let Siri escape, but that you covered it up and now she's dead... No, she's not dead. What? She's not dead. Yeah, the... the PI that I sent to find her found her. She's alive. That... that's a good thing, though, right? Yeah, that's perfect. It's all unicorns and rainbows because now you don't have to worry that the psychopath you let escape might kill someone. Exactly. Because she already has. Who's body do you think it was in the burning car? Yeah, I... I didn't think about that. Yeah, you didn't think about that. You know, the one thing I thought I could count on having an ex-military guy be the head of my security? Professionalism? That he might not piss himself under fire. ♪♪ Luke wasn't in his office. I had him paged. Look, I know what you're worried about, but one escape doesn't mean the end of all your work. We're scientists, Martin. We're allowed to get things wrong. That's why it's called the experimental method. We fuck up sometimes, and we build on our mistakes. I'm afraid the world isn't as forgiving as you imagine. Well, even so, we have to pursue this. Jane... if we did make a mistake, and Siri isHelena, would you... What? Would I what? It doesn't matter. I know what you'd do. I know the right thing to do. Well, good. [Chuckles] What? What's funny? I was just mocking someone for being a coward, yet here I am. I'm sorry. [Laughs] No need to apologize. It's only human to hesitate. I'm not hesitating. And I'm sorry you have to do this. - Martin. Aah! - Aah! [Alarm blaring] [Electricity zapping] [Groans] Aaah! What happened? She attacked me. [Alarm continues] What happened? Hey! What happened? Margot. Hey, back off, please. Martin, what did you do to her? Margot, Margot! What the fuck did you do to her?! I don't know what Margot told you, but she's a fantasist. No, she told me she's an embedded psychiatrist. An embedded psychiatrist? - Yes. - Fantasy. No, she told me the safe words as insurance. She said only you and Dr. Silva knew them. - Really? - Yes. Well, why don't I go get cleaned up, and then we'll go get Dr. Silva, and we'll have a little chat, yeah? ♪♪ So that went well. ♪♪ [Birds chirping] [Ominous music plays] ♪♪ [Knock at door] Ah. [Door buzzes] Luke. You know who the embedded researchers are in our community? No. Do you know the secret passwords they use to identify themselves in case of an emergency? Yes. Siri here says that Margot was one of our embedded researchers and gave her the secret password as insurance. Insurance against what? Siri says that we drugged Margot because she knows the truth about some nefarious business we're involved with, not because she tried to rearrange the inside of my skull with a teapot. "Gibraltar mechanic overcoat." "Gibraltar mechanic overcoat"? "Gibraltar mechanic overcoat." Those are not the safe words. [Sighs] I'll leave you two to your session. I'm sure it'll be a very interesting one. [Door buzzes] ♪♪ ♪♪ Silva: Would you like to talk about what just happened? Who told you the safe words? Fisher? All he had to do to keep control was to tell you the wrong phrase. Siri. Are you in on it? In on what? Oh, fuck. Oh, shit. Carol's right. Carol's right. This is all... this is all a part of Fisher's fucking plan. He... he can't afford to let this happen. I can't... Siri, Siri. I can't breathe. Siri, what's going on? What's happening to me? My... my heart. I think you're having a panic attack. You need to calm down. All right? Just take some deep breaths. No, I don't want you to come... come close. Are you... are you part of this, too? Calm down. Focus on the breath, all right? Fucking really can't... Just in and out and calm down....can't breathe. All right? Aah! Aah! Aah! Ah. [Groans] If I was Siri, this is where I really hurt you. I would just jam this fucking pen right into your ear. Right? I'm not gonna do that. All I want is this. Okay. [Gasps and groans] ♪♪ Take these to the police. If they tell you that these are Siri's fingerprints, I swear to God, I'm never gonna mention Hel ever again. Why should I do that after what you've just done to me? Because I think you're a good person. [Thump] Fisher. He's watching us. Fuck. [Door buzzes] Were you watching us just then? Is your paranoia getting worse, Luke? I was just passing by. [Door buzzes] Was he in there? No. Listen, Siri, uh... I don't think I can take this to the police or... do any... Do you know who Jane Taylor is? Jane Taylor? Yeah. Who is she? She's Fisher's old research partner, his mentor. [Sighs] That would be before my time. Yeah, just please, just find a picture of her. Why? You'll see. ♪♪ [Sighs] Uh, I'll have to think about that. [Door buzzes] I'll see you tomorrow, Siri. [Clears throat] [Sighs] ♪♪ [Door slams] [Knock at door] Martin, do you have a second? I'm kind of busy. What is it? Um... Siri just asked Silva to go to the police. She wants to double check her fingerprints. I... I thought it's important. Why do you think it's important? Thank you. You can go. [Door opens and closes] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Telephone rings] Hello. Yes, Martin? Sure, of course, yeah. I'll be there in a second. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Keyboard clacking] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Call me? Dr. Silva may be going to the police. He's no fool. I just need to speak to him. I want you to stop him, get him to come back here. Oh, shit. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Cellphone ringing] [Door slams] [Ringing continues] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Indistinct shouting] ♪♪ Fuck. [Mutters] [Engine starts] ♪♪ [Tires screech] [Horn honking] [Tires screech] Oh, just stop! Oh! [Tires screeching] Oh, fuck.[Horn honking] Shit! [Horn honking]Oh! [Silva screams] Oh, fuck. No. No. No, no. Oh, fucking hell. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Door beeps] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Whining] [Growling and barking] Come on, baby. - Security found out. - And when did it happen? Host: It happened last night, but we don't have enough information on the matter. Did he leave any message? What... what's going on? Siri, we are terribly sorry, but your session has been canceled. Why? Where's Dr. Silva? There has been some problem. We're not allowed to talk to you... Guys, could you leave us? I'll talk to her. Come, have a seat. No, I... I don't want to. There was an accident. He must have taken the curve too fast. It was terrible drop. He was cycling, as always. What did you tell him? What did you ask him to do? Stop playing your fucking games. Yeah, I will. [Door closes] Hey. [Dog barks and pants] Okay, I'm in. The kamikaze plan... I'm in. What happened? All right, all right. I'll catch you later. [Birds chirping] It's too late for conscience now. But we're in the clear, right? I mean, Margot's safely in the mushroom farm. Poor Dr. Silva's had a terrible accident, but, thankfully, that can't be linked back to us. But if your Army buddy isn't trying to extort more money out of you, that means that Siri Brant is on her way back to us, which presents a whole shitload full of problems. You wanted that. I wanted what? Well, not the problem. You... you wanted a chance to observe the twins. Maybe this could be that. You... you... you could hide one in the mushroom farm, and then you could use the other one as... As part of... Stop talking! Yes, under normal circumstances, with Helena Brant's consent, I would've liked to have studied both of them, but we are a long way from normal now thanks to you. Our job now is to keep this facility open and both of us out of jail. You aregoing to keep your shit together, aren't you? Don't have much choice, do I? No, you don't. You know what I've learned after a lifetime of studying psychopaths? Two things. One is that when your hands are covered in blood, conscience is a luxury you can't afford. And the other one? That ruthless self-interest works a lot better than normal people think. ♪♪ Okay, we'll do this one night after dark before the hosts finish their rounds. And this way, most of them will be busy and away from the base. - Okay. - Okay, stop. This is where we stop them. Okay, how are we gonna do that? You see there? They have to slow down to take the bend. And... you're going to shoot them. With a wooden gun. Yeah. Well, you hold the gun, and I do the shooting. Check this out. ♪♪ [Snap, smack] You see? They see what looks like a bullet hole, they won't think you're holding a fake gun. ♪♪ And then? And then we tie them up, we get to the vehicle, jam a stick into the accelerator so when we get hit by the dead zone, the pedal stays down, and then we crash through the fucking fence. Well, isn't it electrified? Nah, no need. That's what the dead zone's for. And if all goes well, we wake up and get running long before the hosts raise the alarm. Okay. We go tonight. What? No, no. We... we cannot go tonight. We need no moon at all. We go tonight. No, it's... it's... I haveto go tonight. We wait, huh? We have just one shot. I'm not going to waste it. ♪♪ I didn't know you smoked.Yeah. [Exhales] I don't get it. How could this have happened? I suppose I can tell you now. Luke had issues from his past, dark issues. You really think he did it to himself on purpose? Issues like this aren't uncommon in our profession. We're busy taking care of other people that we often ignore our own inner turmoil. I should have noticed that. We all should have. Sophia, I need you to take care of yourself. You have a bright future here with us... if you want it. ♪♪ ♪♪ Ray-Ray. - Yes? - Make yourself scarce. I got a visitor. Raymond, get the fuck out of here. Okay. I've got a question. Why come to me? I mean, yesterday, you were all about getting out of here and snapping my fingers and shit. Yeah, I was a bit overoptimistic. You were groping my knee. Fair enough. But it still doesn't explain why you're here. Well, turns out that out of all the people in here, you're the only one that hasn't lied to me. You got a strange fucking sense of priorities, Siri. I like that about you. Grab a seat. You know, watching you come up that hill, you got a stalker. Corin? I can handle him. You sure about that? Skinned his girlfriend because she tried to break up with him. It's always them little guys that get the nastiest, I think. You said you were here before they put up the invisible fence. First and last out, that's me. So how did they prevent people from climbing or cutting the fence? You planning an escape, Siri? Would you be interested if I was? You know the great thing about gettin' old? Shit calms you down, gives you time to think. Young me would've been all over you tryin' to escape. Old me knows I'll just get caught out there eventually, go on back into a super-max with nothin' to look at but concrete walls and a steel can to shit in for the rest of my life. Old me knows I got a good thing here, real fuckin' good. So, uh... no. I don't want to escape, but, uh... What? ...Fisher fuckin' with us makes me wanna fuck him right back. ♪♪ Thank you. Can I get one more? Yes. Thank you. ♪♪ ♪♪ You gotta back off. [Laughs] What? You've been following me around. You were down by the fence. You were outside my cabin. You're here. Yeah, and... and what were you two doing down at the fence? Planning our escape. You're not gonna deny it? You and him. Well, do you have a plan? [Scoffs] No. He has. And you and I, we're not gonna be able to hijack it if you spook him by creeping around all the time. ♪♪ You and... Morning. Morning. ♪♪ You and I? Well, unless you don't want to come. No, I want to come. Good. This is the plan. We're gonna stop the hosts. We're gonna take their truck and then crash the fence. Wha... That's crazy. No, it's not. The dead zone will knock you out, and then... then the fence is electrified, so... Do you really believe that? Why would they put an electrified fence after the dead zone? That's bullshit. You know that. I know it. Enzo knows it. And neither of us is suicidal. So... we're really gonna hijack it from Enzo. Yes, in one week, when there's no moon. Okay. If you're lying, though... Just think about it. And if you were me, who would you rather be with? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ We're going tonight. I told you, we're not going tonight. I told Carol that you've been planning something, and I also told him that you're the head of the XO. You did what? Now you have to get out of here just as fast as I do before Raymond and Carol starts asking questions. Are you playing me? Everyone in here is playing everyone. You know that. [Growls and barks] Luck, shh. [Growls] I only told Carol about us, and then I told you I did it. Yeah, why? Because I trust you enough to try and escape with me, and after all the fucking shit that I've been through in here, I'm... I'm not gonna let anyone control me, so I'mdriving, and we're going tonight. - You know what? - What? You never looked more like Siri. Yeah? Yeah, and how does that make you feel? Horny. Well, hold that thought. We'll meet at my place half an hour after lights out. Come on. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Glass shatters]Uh! Get out of the car. Where did she get a gun? Get out of the fucking car! Okay, okay. Stay calm.Yeah. You put your fucking hands up. Take off your belts. Move it! And jacket. Come on! ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Man: Security. What's the emergency?

Well, what are you waiting for? Go get him. Siri, what are you doing? Stop this, huh? Come on. [Grunts] ♪♪ Siri, stop. What's the point? You'll never get away with this, Siri. Shut the fuck up. [Grunts] Enzo: Aah, no! Oh, shit. What are you doing? Are you all right? I fell! Oh, shit. ♪♪ What happened? I can't move it. Okay. I think I twisted my ankle. Okay. I can't move it.

I can't do it. I'm not gonna leave without you. Yes. You have to go. You have to go without me. You have to run, get out of here. No, but we're supposed to do this together. This was not how we planned it. No. There's no way we're gonna do it together. Trust me, you have to go now. It's the only chance you have. - Okay. - Okay? But I will come back for you. Yeah. - I promise. - Okay. ♪♪ [Door slams] Ah, shit, Doc. That is a nasty bump on your melon. Stop with your bullshit. Who's escaping? Siri Brant and Enzo. Check their cabins if you don't believe me.
