 ♪♪ No! [ Grunts ] What the fuck, Siri? How do you get in? You knew I was coming! She does seem very invested in this business of being her sister, Helena. I think it could be a tool we could use. Margot: You carry on like this, you end up on the mushroom farm. What's the mushroom farm? This is Himmelstal. No escapes.

 Even if I have to climb that mountain, I'm getting out of here. [ Luck barks ] Let's not go here. Siri: Tell me why Svala Inberg is scared of me. Margot: Well, I don't know, peach. You're the one who's been fucking her. Where's Carol? And you know damn well I'm Carol. You're Carol? I-I've got your camera. I tried to tell him. It's over there. I don't really care about the camera now. I just want you to tell me what you know about the XO and those maps.

[ Breathing heavily ] ♪♪ ♪♪ Who was in your room last night? ♪♪ Siri, we're going to find them and hurt them until they give us the map, so tell us what we need to know. Raymond: I could just break her thumbs. ♪♪ [ Grunts ] Aah! Aah! [ Gasps ] Aah! Shit. [ Crying ] [ Groans ] ♪♪ Carol: Siri, I take it all back. You're every bit as crazy-dangerous as they say. [ Gasping ] ♪♪ [ Engine rumbling ] ♪♪ I used to coach pee-wee football. Done this scads of times. Hurts like a bastard, but needs must. [ Bone cracks ][ Enzo groans ] ♪♪ Siri: What are you doing? Saving his pretty face. Give us what we want, and maybe I can save yours. [ Engine rumbling outside ] Get up. [ Grunts ] If you're good, Enzo won't grass you up for his nose. If I'm good? ♪♪ And don't think I won't find out if you start telling tales. ♪♪ There you are. Well, a bit late for prayers, isn't it? Enzo, what happened to your face? Nosebleed. ♪♪ It's almost curfew. Anyone want to leave back? Nah. We're just fine, thanks. I do. Siri. Guess that's a rain check. ♪♪ [ Engine rumbling ] ♪♪ Wait, stop! What? Just stop. What? Did you see that? What? See what, Siri?[ Engine stops ] What's going on? Is there a little girl in here? Wait. Yes, we went. Yeah, she's fine. Okay, I'll tell her. Dr. Kowalska want to see you tomorrow. But I-I just saw a little girl. Oh, yeah, the girl.[ Chuckles ] Little Red Riding Hood.[ Chuckles ] [ Engine starts ] Hang on. ♪♪ ♪♪ Well, lookie here. This little creature met a sticky end. Huh. Rabbit pie tonight. Wonder who we have to thank for that. ♪♪ How's your nose? Hurts like a bastard. Well, you might be hurting a lot worse if she hadn't hit you. Ray-Ray thought it might have been you he saw in her cabin last night, out for some strange. [ Scoffs ] Fucking Raymond. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Engine stops ]There we go. Chauffeur service ends here. Wait, wait. You... You said Kowalska wanted to see me. Yeah, tomorrow. Can you check if she's still in? I'd like to speak to her now. Please. Tell... Tell her it's Hel. Hel needs to talk. [ Door beeps, buzzes ] Hel, you wanted to see me. Is there a little girl in here? What? Just tell me, is there a little girl in here? Can... Can you look it up on the system? I don't need to. The youngest female in Himmelstal is actually you. Why are you asking? Nothing. Did you see a little girl, as you saw your sister everywhere when you were a kid? Forget it. Okay, Hel. [ Exhales ] Why are we here? The hosts told me there was something going on at the chapel. Do you want to talk about it? [ Sighs ] Do you feel threatened, or you're in danger? Of course I'm in danger. I'm... I'm in a fucking valley with psychopaths. Okay. If there's a problem, you can tell me. If... If I tell you anything, and they figure out I've said it... We can protect you. Oh, like Corin was protected, like Svala Inberg? Svala Inberg was an accident. Or you know otherwise? [ Sighs ] Hel, do you want to tell me something about her accident? ♪♪ Can I trust you? Of course you can trust me. ♪♪ I can only do this if we're alone. It has to be just between you and me. Sure, as you see. But I can't see, can I? It has to be clear in there, too. You have my word. Show me what's behind that mirror. ♪♪ It switches, doesn't it? Switch it for me. All right. ♪♪ ♪♪ You're good? ♪♪ Yeah. Okay, so, what did you want to tell me? I'm not safe in the valley. What do you mean? I-I-I've been targeted repeatedly. Just now, Carol had Raymond hold my head underwater. They were ready to drown me. Why do you think they targeted you? I don't know. It... It's something to do with Siri, stuff she did that I'm not part of because she had something they wanted. Do you know what it is? Yeah, a camera. A camera. What did they want with a camera? ♪♪ Hel? ♪♪ Listen. [ Clears throat ] [ Chuckles ] You have to be honest. Tell me everything or nothing. Half-truths just mean I cannot believe any of it. ♪♪ Siri needed the camera so she could convince me that her girlfriend on the outside was in danger. It was all part of her plan to trap me in here. She... She told me she had finally fallen in love, her big love, her... her David. Shit! Who's David? ♪♪ I had someone. ♪♪ He died. I'm so sorry. But it was David. No, this is not about me. This is about Siri. Okay, but she used him. How... How did she use him? She didn't use him. Siri: She... She said that her girlfriend was in Milan. What do you think? And that she was... She's certainly constructed a very compelling tale. I just don't like us having to leave the viewing window. Dr. Kowalska might need us to intervene. Sophia is a professional. She's an academic. So she wanted us to swap. She hasn't been involved in real-life scenarios like this before. And when I said no, she... She had this photo delivered of a... of a woman badly beaten. What you are saying is the girlfriend in that photo is Svala Inberg. Yes, but she called her Graziela. You believe me now, right? Why would I tell you all this stuff if I wasn't really Hel? I don't know. Okay. If I'm Siri, I've just confessed to assaulting Svala Inberg, and I told you everything about what Carol just did to me, and he already wants me dead. If I were Siri, I would never tell you all this. Can you prove it? Well, Svala is shit scared of me. That's a pretty good clue. Ask her what happened. Take me to see her, and... And... and you'll see. Unfortunately, it's not possible. She's had to be put back into a medical coma. But I-I-I thought she was getting better. Is there anything else to support your story? That photo of Svala with her face smashed in. Have you got that photo? No. The question is how would she have managed all this? The CCTV cameras... There are blind spots, and Siri used them. How? I don't know. If I knew that, I'd have the map they want so much, and I wouldn't be in all this trouble. A map. So, I've told you everything. I can't go back. Okay. Come with me. Dr. Silva: Where is she taking her? Man: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. [ Keypad beeps, buzzes ]Where are we going? You just told me you're in danger. I have to put you somewhere you'll be safe. ♪♪ This is the mushroom farm? It's all right. Come on. [ Distant grunting ] [ Man groans ] Guard: What's going on? Guard #2: What is it? It's okay. Open the door. [ Banging ]It's this one. [ Keypad buzzes ] [ Man shouting indistinctly ] I-I don't want to be down here. It's this, or it's outside. It's for your own safety, just... just overnight. Listen, I have a plan for tomorrow. I've got to get clearance, but I think Dr. Fisher will agree. What? Trust me, I will tell you everything tomorrow. I promise. Please. ♪♪ Get some sleep. ♪♪ We'll talk in the morning, okay? ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Knock on door ] Sophia, I hear you have a plan. [ Door closes ] Yeah. I need her trust. Just, uh, remember, you cannot trust her... Never, not a single word. Look, I know that. So, you watched it all? Riveting stuff. Yeah, the story about David... I wasn't able to... To get her to open up. It does check out. David Nyberg, uh, died in a bus crash in Nepal. Siri would know about that. Mm-hmm. And the other stuff... Uh, Carol? Oh, well, Carol's Dr. Fisher's patient. Carol sees himself as a kind of king of the valley. Siri is on his radar, and I think he might see her as a threat to his power. Hmm, so she's not necessarily lying about everything. What is your plan for Siri, Dr. Kowalska? Martin. Hm? With your permission, I would like to take her through our full range of admission tests again, everything that positions her on the psychopath scale. As if she were a new patient? Yes, exactly. And... [ Chuckles ] ...what do you think this will prove? That there's been a mix-up with security? No. She's not a psychopath after all, and we really have locked up her sister by mistake? No. I don't know. I don't know. I... Look, I want to ask questions. I really think I'm achieving something by treating Hel as a separate individual, but to make it work, I need to take it further. I think there's such a thing as taking it too far, Martin. Well, Luke, if there is, we haven't gotten there yet. But this is completely untraveled territory. Yes, and sometimes, it's good to take the road less traveled. I mean, Sophia has gotten more out of her in one session than we have in a year. I mean, the Svala confession. It was just amazing. But, Martin, you know Siri is the queen of the tidy explanation after the fact, and it's always a fake. Do I have a green light? Absolutely. Why not? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Bad luck, Prince Charming. Cinderella's not in. Never came home last night, so maybe she turned into a fun pumpkin. You think she's in trouble? You should know. You're the one who's camped out of Carol's bum. Fuck off, Margot. Charmed, I'm sure. [ Keypad beeps, buzzes ] Good morning, Hel. We brought you some clean clothes. In a while, Anna will show you where the shower is, and... and then we'll get started. I'm afraid you won't get breakfast this morning, but you can eat afterwards. After what? Dr. Fisher is permitting some psychological testing, everything we present new patients with, admitting you as Hel. Obviously, we have government authorization for Siri's treatment, but for Hel's, we will need your signature. Um, but how is this supposed to help me? It means we are taking seriously a potentially separate individual. If you are Hel, if you are not a psychopath, this is the moment it becomes beyond doubt. Siri tested very clearly when she arrived. Sign here. Great. Nurse: Take a seat, please. We'll start with your blood tests. What for? Dr. Kowalska: Standard procedure. We look at genetic variants, possible mutations that may be factors in conditions such as psychopathy. But me and Siri are identical twins. Any genetic variants she has, I have. Yes. So what's the point? It's not gonna prove that I'm not her. We're just running everything the same as we do for all first-time patients. Wait. Did Siri have any genetic variants? I can't discuss another patient's results with you, Hel. ♪♪ What's gonna happen now is, you're going to see different faces on that screen. On the pad, you will see four different emotions. Just pick the emotion you think fits best the face. ♪♪ Are you ready? Yes. [ Computer beeps ] ♪♪ [ Pad beeps ] ♪♪ It's going too fast. ♪♪ None of these emotions fit. They're... They're all the same. There's no difference. It's not a right or wrong reaction, Hel. It's just what you feel. ♪♪ This looks at your physical response to emotional stimuli. Images... some extreme, some very banal. You don't have to do anything. Just look at the screen. The sensors will tell us the rest. ♪♪ I want you to get all this processed as quickly as possible. ♪♪ So, what's happening now? Dr. Kowalska: I have some questions. Try and answer them as honestly as possible. Okay. Would you consider yourself as someone committed to a career? What do you mean? Have you ever worked your way up in a job or company? Um... ♪♪ Not exactly. What about money? Are you responsible with that? It all feels a bit pointless lately, but I used to be. Legal or criminal trouble, any history of violence? Aah! Self-defense. Do you plan things carefully, or you're impulsive? [ Scoffs ] I can be spontaneous, but I can also be thoughtful. These are very binary questions. ♪♪ Dr. Kowalska: Okay. You can expect images to come up one after the other. The fMRI will track your responses. ♪♪ Is that... Yes. [ Machine whirring, beeping ] ♪♪ Dr. Kowalska: What is really interesting about what we are seeing here is when we compare it with this... Siri's one year ago. Where is this going? I'll get to health diagnosis in a minute. I have some more comparisons to show you first. The psychopath questionnaire, the emotion identification. Can I just have a little word with you? Hold on, Jack, not now. The visualization isn't quite as pretty. Excuse me, could you... Thanks. But the results are the same. Let's see. Siri's... and Hel's. And once more, Siri's and Hel's. [ Clears throat ] Sophia, are all these divergences within the normal realm of testing? Absolutely. Any one of them is at the edge of but within an expected range for tests carried out on the same person, yeah. Because that could be true of any one of these tests, but if they're all divergent and in the same direction, we have to accept there is something different here. [ Chuckles ] Yeah, thank you. The functional MRI results were so different. I ran the test three times across the range of testing. This is something Siri just couldn't fake. I can see this is no longer a psychological test for you, so what is your diagnosis for Siri, or, excuse me, Hel? Sorry, this is ridiculous. You're... You're saying that you think that despite our security and all evidence, what, that... That somehow Siri managed to swap? No, but... Well... what other explanation could there be? Actually, I have something more. Thank you. Last thing... our final fMRI. Dr. Kowalska: Hel, thanks so much for coming back. I wanted to track your responses to our responses if that's all right. Yeah, fine. Just get on with it. Wait a second. My results were different from Siri's, right? Um... Yes. Your results were not the same as those we took a year ago, but they weren't so different as for us to formally conclude that you are a separate individual. No, that... that can't be right. They must have been different. The results we obtained yesterday suggest that you're closer to the edge of normal than we had previously positioned you. That you positioned my sister, Siri. However, clinically, on every scale, you are, in fact, a psychopath. What? No, that can't be true. Dr. Silva: But I don't follow. Is she a psychopath, or isn't she? Is she Siri, or is she Hel? You don't seem to have a consistent argument to make. Exactly... the inconsistency. The inconsistency is my point. She is a psychopath, but a different psychopath. She's Siri, but not Siri. She's a psychopath who you have started to cure. [ Indistinct chatter ] Come on. That's... That's not even possible. How do we know that? Man: Psychopathy can't be cured. I know. We think that psychopathy is not curable, but what if it's possible? What if all the work you've been doing here, Luke, has really paid off? What if Siri's sister's visit just unlocked some of the changes that she has made, and playing the role of her sister has allowed her to explore emotions she wasn't previously capable of? Oh, come on. It's... it's just a game. She's playing with us, this sister acting that she's doing. Okay, she's still manipulative, pretending to be Hel, and violent, hurting Svala, but in admitting to hurting Svala, she's... She's showing remorse. With Corin, she's going out of her way to help other people. What if your certainty that a cure is not possible has made you blind to what's happened right in front of your eyes? [ Scoffs ] Do you think that's possible? [ Indistinct chatter ] ♪♪ Great showmanship. It wasn't a performance. I think you might be doing something really extraordinary here. [ Laughs ] Trust me, I would love to believe you, but, uh... But confirmation bias. I know. You see, Luke, this is exactly why I hired her. I just didn't see it paying off so quickly. What's next? We keep doing exactly what you've been doing. I think we should build on this growth, Luke, by releasing her back into the environment that's allowed this kind of progress. Don't you think? ♪♪ [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Alarm blaring ] [ Indistinct shouting ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Knock on door ] Still here? Yeah. [ Chuckles ] May I? [ Door closes ] Sure, sure. [ Exhales ] Got a glass for me? I thought you don't drink. Special occasions. Okay, so this is a special occasion? Of course. Thank you. Congratulations. [ Glasses clink ]It's your breakthrough. Congratulations are definitely yours, Sophia, handing Martin the Holy Grail of a cure. But you don't think Siri's improved. [ Chuckles ] I think she's so improved, I'm no longer completely sure she's the Siri I know. ♪♪ Is it possible that we might have pushed her into schizophrenia? I didn't see any sign of that. Mm. It's not what Martin wants to hear, either, is it? ♪♪ I don't know what Martin wants to hear. [ Chuckles ] ♪♪ Thanks for the drink. But you've hardly drunk any. No, it's a little sweet for me. ♪♪ [ Door opens, closes ] ♪♪ ♪♪ What do you make of Siri, hm? Do you find her different from before? I don't have much to compare her with. We never mix much. Uh, are you avoiding her? I'm just trying to live quiet and do my thing. I mean, I'm really just trying to get your impressions of Siri. I don't know. On the one hand, she seems a little lesser than normal, bit confused, maybe. Vulnerable? Would you just like me to think she's vulnerable? I'm just an observer. ♪♪ [ Keypad beeps, buzzes ] ♪♪ Good morning. Anna will, uh, take you home whenever you're ready. Home? To the cabin. Well, you can't do that. I told you, I'm not safe out there. We're keeping a close eye, especially on Carol. No, but if... If he wants to reach me, he won't have to do it himself. We'll be keeping watch, but if I can make a suggestion, keep any mentions of Hel to a minimum out there. It... It only makes you vulnerable. ♪♪ [ Door closes ] Dr. Fisher: I'm surprised your paths haven't crossed more. Why is that? Professional courtesy. Siri's not a power in the valley, not like you. You're afraid she's, what, a threat? ♪♪ My Uncle Joe lived down in Oxnard, collecting scrap metal. Kids would break into his lot and steal stuff, so he had these two mean old junkyard dogs, and they'd have killed each other, except the lot was big enough, and they each had a separate kennel in either end, so they didn't have to get into each other's face all day. Mm-hmm. Well, one day, the county was spraying for some damn Mexican fruit fly or some shit, so Uncle Joe put the dogs inside the trailer for the night, save them from the, uh... The Agent Orange or whatever toxic shit the county was gonna drop from the sky. The trailer was a double-wide. It was plenty big enough, you'd have thought. And the dogs fought, and the weaker one died. No, poor mutts killed each other. ♪♪ Place looked like Carrie White's prom night. There was even blood dripping from the ceiling. See, those dogs knew enough to stay out of each other's way. It was Uncle Joe that denied them that professional courtesy. ♪♪ See, I always thought they got it wrong... The dogs. Their problem wasn't each other. Their problem was Uncle fucking Joe forcing them into that confined space. See, the two of them working together, they could have taken him... easy. Your metaphor seems to have taken a rather violent turn. Really, Doc? Mm-hmm. ♪♪ How does that make you feel? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Going somewhere? Shit. What the fuck are you doing here? Siri, it's me. We're cool. You can stop now. We're cool? [ Chuckles ] I find you in the chapel together with Carol letting Raymond fucking drown me. No, we're not cool. [ Laughing ] What do you want me to do? It's my job, isn't it? Stay close to Carol, learn all we can. We're only going to get out of here if we have all the information that's available. You said that. I didn't know it was going to be you at the chapel. What do you want? You've been missing for three days. I was worried. Carol is not exactly happy either. He thinks you've been blabbing about him. [ Scoffs ] ♪♪ Wait, what happened to your scar? Look, I don't want to get involved anymore, okay? ♪♪ Hey, just hold on a second! What? ♪♪ Stop! I just want to check something. What? Could you please show me your neck? My neck? Please, follow me on this one thing. Can I just see the left side of your neck? Why? Please. You're Helena. ♪♪ I knew it. But how? Siri had a scar there from when we went fishing. It was an accident. I can't believe it. She left you here? ♪♪ That bitch. Sure, you're in. Siri's out now. Everything makes sense. That's why you behaved that way at the chapel. I trusted her. Wait, we need to tell them. We need to talk to them. No one believes us. No, we have to tell Dr. Silva you... You know about this. We can just go there. You can go with me. Hey, listen! These people, they don't believe a word of what we say. No, please. Just come with me. There's nothing we can do. Besides, Carol will kill me if he knows about us. ♪♪ This is crazy. ♪♪ [ Birds chirping ] [ Creek babbling ] [ Sighs ] What are you looking for? I thought I saw a child in here, a little girl, and I thought if I... If I find her, I could find the way she got in. It was just a stupid idea. Listen. You want to find a way out of this place? Yeah. All right. Follow me. I'll show you something. Come on. Helena, trust me. ♪♪ ♪♪ Wait for me here. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hey, wait! Wait! Stop right there. [ Gasps ] Open your hand. Please, please, please don't shoot. ♪♪ Don't shoot, please. [ Laughs ] I knew it was good, but not this good. Take it. It's wood. I made it. It's made of wood. So that's the plan. When the house are on patrol, we show up with that gun. They're gonna be shit scared. We stop them, take their uniforms. That's a kamikaze plan. Wait, let me finish! Where are you going now? Fuck. [ Wire snaps ]Ah, fuck! [ Groans ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Tires rumbling ] ♪♪ Why are you chasing me? I-I'm not. Uh, I've been looking for you. I-I need to ask you how you... No, wait! Wait! Fuck. Wait, I just want to talk to you! ♪♪ Wait! Wait, stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop! That wasn't me. I did not kill those animals, okay? You're... You're right to be scared. There are some really, really bad people in here. ♪♪ How did you get in? Please, just tell me. How did you get in? We... We have to get out of here, okay? Why? Because the people in here, they're... They're dangerous, okay? Dangerous. Yes. Please, just show me how you got in, okay? Was... Was there a hole in the fence, or... ♪♪ Down there. Down there? Okay, come on. Come on. This is not a place for a kid, okay? Come on. Show me. ♪♪ Okay. [ Bicycle horn honks ] It's here? This is where we go through? Yes. [ Fence buzzing ] You can go under it. Is it safe? Yeah. I do it every day. Just be careful. ♪♪ [ Beeping ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
