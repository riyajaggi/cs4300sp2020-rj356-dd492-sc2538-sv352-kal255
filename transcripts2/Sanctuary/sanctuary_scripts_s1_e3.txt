 I know this is gonna sound shocking, but I'm not Siri. She's pretending to be her sister. She's saying they swapped. Of course she is, but could she be telling the truth? [ Grunts ] Where's the camera? Tell Carol I'll bring it up. Yeah, we all get a case of the get-me-outs every now and then. Do you know a way to get out of here? It's just this place is... I hear you.

 What's Graciela doing here? Dr. Silva: No, that's Svala Inberg. [ Car horn honks ] [ Speaks Russian ] Dr. Silva, this is Dr. Kowalska. Ah, my new shadow. A psychopath is a person unrestrained by conscience. You think Siri's a psychopath? Corin: I need it back. What? Don't play games, Siri. This is serious. ♪♪ You took my thumbprint when I first got here. Check it. It will prove who I am. I'm afraid your bluff's been called, Siri.

 With you, there's never a dull moment. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Wolf howls ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Gasps ] What the fuck are you doing? Hey! Get off. Siri, I'm... I'm so sorry, Siri. My bad. Jesus. ♪♪ ♪♪ Corin: Hey, Siri! Have you got the camera? No. Hey, why are you trying to get me killed? I'm not trying to get you killed. Fuck. Jesus, Siri. I like having my fingers. You want me to tell Carol it was really you that wanted the damn thing and then lost it? No one's gonna break your fingers. No, no... take, Siri. Not break. Take, like... [ Imitates cracking ] Fuck. I'm talking about Carol. And this Carol has done this before? There are cameras. They're our hosts. And accidents never happen? No, Siri. Unless you get me the camera, I have to tell Carol. [ Alarm blaring ] This shit is on you. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Dog barking in distance ] [ Piano playing inside ] [ Stick clatters ] [ Keypad beeps, buzzes ] ♪♪ [ Exhales ] Shit. Okay. Okay. Camera. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Knock on door ] All good, Siri? Happy as a clam. That's great. Sleep well. [ Laughs ] Mark is improving. [ Speaking indistinctly ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Shower door closes ] ♪♪ No! Oh! What the... [ Grunts ] What are you doing? Oh, shit. What the fuck, Siri? How did you get in? You knew I was coming! You moved the twig on the door! Shit, Siri. I was just going to surprise you with... With some flowers, okay, from the greenhouse. It's the last time I try something this cheesy, okay? You can't just... [ Banging on door ] Hosts? Or Carol's guys? I can't be found here. I got to go. Uh, I'll see you later. Oh, I was never here. [ Banging continues ] [ Clatter ] C-Coming. ♪♪ Corin: Siri. [ Coughs ] Oh, my God! [ Gasps ] [ Crying ] Shit. Shh! What happened? What happened to you? Help! I told you. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, Margot! Margot! [ Sobs ] Fuck. Margot! [ Bangs on door ] Margot! [ Sobs ] It's okay. It's okay. Aah! Fuck. [ Muttering indistinctly ] Help! Help! Fuck! Back off! Back off! What happened? You have to help! He's bleeding! It's all over... Stay there! Stay there! Stay there! [ Crying ] [ Monitors beeping ] Did she mess him up like this? No abrasions on her fists. CCTV doesn't lie. He was already messed up when she got to her cabin. This isn't good. The valley's been safer than ever. Then we have Svala Inberg's accident and all this violence in a couple of days. Freeze. Zoom in on her. Now play this one. Freeze. Her reaction... It's very interesting. Every display of normal affect. Empathetic, horrified, scared. Well, Siri does know how to play a part. Well, I'm guessing you want to keep her in Category 1 for observation. Not at all. Clean her up and let her go back to her cabin. You're sure? Absolutely. [ Crickets chirping ] Siri: What? You're just gonna put me back out there in the cabin? It's your home, Siri. Did you see what someone did? Someone who... Who's still out there? Did you see who it was? No. Do you know who it was? No. Well, try not to worry. Enough people out there looking for whoever did it, and believe me, there'll be a full investigation. Plus, Corin was moving about the valley after curfew. You'll be inside. And that's safe? Safe as hell. Listen. Corin... He must have had a disagreement with someone, and sadly, as you know, such things are often settled in the dark, or if you're experiencing heightened fears, I can always ask Dr. Silva for some medication? Chemical cosh? No thanks. Champion. Hey. I'm sure you'll sleep much better in your own bed. Okay? You'll be fine. ♪♪ [ Piano playing ] [ Sighs ] [ Soft thudding ] [ Sighs ] [ Piano continues playing ] [ Birds chirping ] Guys, I hope you've all had the opportunity to meet our new colleague, Sophia Kowalska. - Hello. - Welcome. Hi. Sophia comes to us from Harvard, but we won't hold that against her. [ Laughter ] And how are you settling in? Good, thanks. So, what did you make of her? Siri Brant... what do you make of her shenanigans? Atypical. Atypical? Really? Because... She has put herself in harm's way in not one but two acts of altruism in as many days. Luke? Oh, I'd like to say it was the result of our work with her, claim it as a long-awaited success, but I'm afraid we do have to beware confirmation bias. Of course, but my gut tells me it was very odd behavior for a psychopath. Sophia, these guys have heard me say this a zillion times, but we look into the abyss, and the abyss looks back at us, trying to find itself in the reflection. As we study them, they study us, learning how to mimic emotions that they're not able to feel. [ Chuckles ] Yes, of course. But there's something different here. She does seem very invested in this business of being her sister, Helena. Yeah, and it could be highly manipulative, but still, it's unusual. I think it could be a tool we could use. [ Chuckles ] A tool? Yeah. Go on. ♪♪ You have headphones? Oh, afternoon, duchess. Nice of you to get up. The piano is electric! Yeah, so? So you can use your damn earphones at night! What, you don't like Chopin? Not as much as I like sleeping, no. Well, these, Siri, are his fucking "Nocturnes," and Chopin wrote these for his friend who had insomnia. When Chopin shows up, call me. Maybe he can get the notes in the right order. Until then, use the fucking earphones. Touchy. Where are you going? I'm gonna find a way to get out of this place. Well, good luck with that. I don't need luck. Even if I have to climb that mountain, I'm getting out of here. I don't blame you. That scary nutter Carol was around earlier asking all sorts of questions about who's been visiting you after dark and how close you were to Svala Inberg. Jackals are circling. So, you want to continue doing sessions with Siri as if you're speaking to her sister, Helena? Yes. As far as I know, there's no literature about the correlation between psychopathy and multiple personality disorder. Right, but she's chosen to counterfeit an identity. I'd be interested in following her down that rabbit hole and see where she intends to go. Mm-hmm. I could establish a relationship with Helena, and then your relationship with Siri could go on uninterrupted, as usual. Luke, she's your patient. Why not? I'm all for a new tool. But there is something I'd need you to see first. [ Camera whirring ] Hey, you again! You lost? [ Electric buzzing ] [ Luck whines ] [ Luck barks ] [ Barks ] Yeah. Let's not go here. [ Luck barks ] Shh, shh, shh, shh. Okay. Come on. ♪♪ Dr. Silva: Welcome to the mushroom farm. Sadly, most of the inmates here are drugged into a stupor. That's what you want to show me? Uh, no, I wanted to show you Mr. Block. Father Block was a priest. Also, he was a predatory sex murderer and a cannibal. Picked up single women at the dog park. Used puppies as bait. ♪♪ Everyone loves a puppy, right? They're a great icebreaker. [ Chuckles ] He had two eyes and a full set of teeth when he arrived here. What happened? Siri Brant happened. When she got here, like a message to the other inmates, "Just because I'm a woman, don't mess with me," and she made her point, and even though I believe that we made great progress with her, the thing to remember is this... What she's actually capable of. So you think I shouldn't pursue it. No. [Chuckles] Not at all. I'm just saying be very, very careful. [ Water rushing ] ♪♪ Luck! Come here! ♪♪ ♪♪ Oh, shoot. ♪♪ [ Breathing heavily ] [ Exhales ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ You shouldn't do that tai chi crap. It's not tai chi. I don't care what it is. It's not your culture. You're not an Asiatic. You're appropriating it. What? You're taking something that doesn't belong to you. I don't know what you're on about. I know you've got it. Your little friend told me. He didn't want to. He even tried to be a stand-up guy... until he broke. ♪♪ Return the camera you had him borrow from Carol or pay. It'll get really ugly for you if you don't pay. Pay her what? You know Carol. You know Carol's rules. No. What does she want from me? ♪♪ I'm sure you could learn to do those exercises without your thumbs. ♪♪ ♪♪ Okay. [ Exhales ] "Okay," what? Carol. Why is everyone scared of Carol? Piss off. You know all about Carol. Don't try and draw me into whatever bullshit you're brewing between you. No, but that's not me. It's... [ Exhales ] O-Okay. You said the jackals were circling. Did I? I do have a lovely turn of phrase. I'm a bit sketchy about which jackals. I feel like I'm forgetting something I should be taking care of. You want me to jog your memory, peach, it's gonna cost you. Since I'm on the naughty stuff, get me a pack of 20 from the shop and a lighter, and then I'll tell you all you're messing up. Messing up how? Oh, interested now, aren't you? Make it two packs... Full strength. No funnying around with any of that low-tar crap with as much kick as this fucking vapor. Sure. Sure. Fags first. But I will tell you this for nothing. This place, not all the jackals are in the zoo. [ Birds chirping, water trickling ] Things are changing in our little community. Things are always changing. Can't control it. How does that make you feel? That question, Doc, makes me feel like someone put a penny in the cliché machine. [ Chuckles ] You've been talking to Siri Brant. Did she tell you that? The host or your cameras? ♪♪ Fuck you, Doc. There's not meant to be any cameras above the lake. That was the deal. Well, it's not just cameras that see things. Yeah, but you know I'm gonna look for them now, right? Well, not a good idea to destroy more of the institute's property. Perish the thought, huh? [ Chuckles ] I just like to know where they are. Someone's got to watch the watchmen, right? ♪♪ [ Church bell chimes ] Hey, Brant. Peace offering. I know you like them. I just ate. No, you haven't. I've been watching you. You've been walking around all morning, looking shifty. But you love these things! Come on. Oh, you're sulking for last night? No. Well, I'm sorry. You know, I have a bad history with being hit. Y-You surprised me. That's all. Yeah. That would be, normally, a good thing in our relationship... Spontaneity. [ Indistinct chatter ] I got to go now. You-know-who is pissed off at something. No, wait. Who? Come here. What happened to Svala... It's got Carol really riled up. The accident? And, Siri, apart from Carol, the others have been talking. The others? The XO. The XO think you might have something to do with this. I told them no, but it had to be someone who has seen the map we made who did this to Svala, know what I'm saying? The map we made? What map? Don't play dumb, Siri. You're in danger. Carol is really pissed. He wants that secret CCTV map. Shit. I'll see you later. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Luck barks ] Hey! Hey, Luck. Hey, boy. Where did you go? There you are, Siri. [ Barks ] [ Growls ]Shh, shh, shh. Good boy. I don't want any trouble. Carol wants the camera. [ Barks ] Shh, shh, shh, shh. And you know where it is, don't you? Here come the cavalry. If you don't want any trouble, like the sort that got poor little Corin, bring the camera to the chapel at 6 o'clock, and don't bring that dog, or I'll gut it. Woman: Siri, hurry up. You're late for your physical checkup. ♪♪ [ Flashlight clicks ] ♪♪ [ Flashlight clicks ] Okay. And no headaches, blurred vision? No. All right. I think you're fine. If there's anything, just come tell us, okay? How's Corin doing? Not so good. You can go see him. Maybe you can cheer him up. He's in Room 3. [ Monitor beeping ] [ Door closes ] ♪♪ [ Whimpers ] [ Machine beeping rapidly ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Footsteps approaching ] Step aside, please. Man: Morphine? Yes, 0.5. [ Nurses speaking indistinctly ] ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Monitor beeping ] ♪♪ Hey. ♪♪ Look, Corin, I'm not who you think I am. I didn't tell them anything. Raymond did this to you. Said you'd take care of shit. Said you were part of the XO. Said that between you and them, no one would dare hurt me. Said I was on your team. [ Sniffles ] But you don't have a team. You only think about yourself, as always. ♪♪ ♪♪ What's the XO? Do I look like Wikipedia? No. You look like you need a smoke. Okay. ♪♪ The XO... as in Escape Organization... It's an urban myth around here. Meant to be a secret organization of inmates dedicated to finding a way out of this place, but it's fucking futile, peach, because A... the place is impregnable, and B... you know, organize a bunch of psychopaths like we've got in here? Be easier to herd cats on crack. ♪♪ [ Cigarette wrapper rustles ] ♪♪ Do you want to go for the full pack? Tell me why Svala Inberg is scared of me. Well, I don't know, peach. Maybe you're scary in bed. You're the one who's been fucking her. ♪♪ [ Door closes ] ♪♪ Ah, Dr. Kowalska. Hey. How are you settling in? Good. I was thinking, actually, um, maybe you'd like to go for a jog. You know, I can show you them trails. [ Chuckles ] I'd like that. Yeah? Good. Yeah, it's a date. I-I mean, it's not a date. It's not a date. It's a... Plan. Plan... that's the one. Well, I gather you're... You're going to see Siri Brant. Yes, Dr. Fisher thought it might be interesting to try something different. Oh, okay. Well, I won't keep you. [ Indistinct chatter ] [ Door opens ] Siri: Try what? Dr. Kowalska: It's your choice, of course, but if Helena would like, still, to talk to someone, I'm... I'm... I'm interested. So you believe me? I believe Hel has something to say, yes, and I have questions. ♪♪ Okay? ♪♪ Okay. Good. The first one is not especially surprising. Your parents? My parents aren't relevant. Actually, everyone's parents are relevant. [ Sighs ] Okay. Um... My dad was a practical man. He was a farmer. And my mother lived a life of the mind. That sounds rehearsed. It's something he used to say. Was that why they split? No, that was us. Dr. Kowalska: Us? Me and Siri. Siri and I. That's novel. Novel? Yes. They thought we'd be better apart. Usually, family stay together because of their children. Why? Together, we fought. Like siblings fight? No, not like that. Not like what? These were fight fights. Fight fights? Yeah. Our dad... he thought that women should be able to defend themselves, so instead of ballet classes, we did aikido. And you would rather have done ballet? Not especially. But you mentioned it. Yeah, I mean, if we'd done ballet, then maybe the fights at home wouldn't have got out of hand. Mm-hmm. Even if they started as practice, she always went too far. She bit. She scratched. She hit me with a hammer once and broke my wrist. ♪♪ She didn't mean to, but she was too... Too what? ...too unbreakable. She couldn't bend, and she would never admit to losing. That would drive her into fury. And then I'd get upset 'cause it was so unfair. Define unfairness. What do you mean? I mean, uh, how did unfairness feel to you as a child? Well, fairness would have been not stealing the trophies I won at school. Silly little plastic cups, but I won them, and I liked them. And she took them? Yeah. They'd be there by my side, and then they'd disappear, like all my toys. She would say that I hid them myself just so I could blame her from stealing them from me, and we never, ever found where she put them, so she could never be punished for it. ♪♪ That was what unfair felt like. And then they split you up?[ Exhales ] ♪♪ Yeah, Mom did. ♪♪ Mother. And for you, how did it feel being split? Could you... describe it somehow? ♪♪ I don't know. Try. ♪♪ Think of precise words. ♪♪ [ Exhales ] I felt sad, weird... Mm-hmm. ...angry, guilty, confused, relieved. Pick an adjective. ♪♪ Relieved. When Siri left, I didn't think it was gonna be forever. You missed her? She's my twin. When you see yourself as a child missing her, what exactly do you see? [ Sighs ] ♪♪ I'd see her. I'd see her in school, on the street, in the woods. I'd see her red jacket and run after her, but when I caught up, it was never her, always some other kid. She'd still be away in America. And you'd be still alone at home. Yeah. What are you doing there? I'd just be in my room. I'd lay on my side of the room just looking at her bed, her empty bed. Can you describe it more? It was just a kid's bed. Flat and empty. ♪♪ Do you think you were mourning her as if she actually died? [ Sighs ] ♪♪ Maybe. ♪♪ And then I found them. You found? All the things that had gone missing. All my trophies, my prizes, my awards, my best-loved toys, my cups were hidden in the mattress. ♪♪ What's wrong? No, it's just that I... I forgot about the mattress. What are you thinking now? Nothing. I was surprised that I'd forgotten about the mattress until now. Hmm. Are we done here? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Chuckles ] [ Chuckles ] That bitch. ♪♪ ♪♪ What's wrong? No, it's just that I... I forgot about the mattress. Letting Siri pretend to be Helena was such a good idea. Yeah, she... She was very compelling. Siri: ....I'd forgotten about the mattress until now. If there were Oscars for psychopaths, Siri Brant would be our Meryl Streep. Yeah. Are we done here? Dr. Silva: Where is she? Where did she go? Oh, there she is. ♪♪ She seems in a hurry. Hmm. ♪♪ She's headed for the chapel. That's one place we don't have cameras in. Maybe she's having a come-to-Jesus moment. Huh. [ Church bells chime ] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [ Siri gasps ] No! No! No! ♪♪ [ Grunting ] [ Inhales sharply ] Raymond! [ Inhales sharply ] You're out of control. [ Coughs ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Coughs ] ♪♪ [ Clatters ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Gasps ] It's okay. Raymond's not gonna hurt you. Where's Carol? Yeah, that's right. [ Breathing shakily ] Word is you're so messed up in the head these days, you're claiming selective amnesia. Hey. I'm not judging you. Whatever works. Who wouldn't want to start with a clean slate? It's a fair play, you going for the karmic reboot, and you know damn well I'm Carol. You're Carol? No, but wait. I've got your camera. I tried to tell him. It's over there. Aw, shit. I don't really care about the camera now. I just want you to tell me what you know about the XO and those maps. I don't... I don't know ...Are you in the XO? [ Gulps ] No.But you know why I'm asking. No! Shit. And I thought you were meant to be something, Siri, but you're not really much, are you? See, now, Fisher's got this valley covered in hidden CCTV cameras. We are like little lab rats in this big fucking pine-scented maze. The XO have a map with all the blind spots. I want that map. It'd be good to have... for some people, anyway, like if, uh, Svala didn't have an accident but got attacked, which is my theory, right, Ray-Ray? But she's a feisty one and ain't no fucking midnight mountaineer, is she, you know? So now, they couldn't have gotten away with it unless they could get around without being spotted, right? Right. So, like, logic tells me that they must have been in the XO and had that map 'cause they disappeared like poof... [ Gasps ] ...before Svala was found all bloodied up. ♪♪ Shit, Siri. You are fucking up to something. I don't know what, but there's a reason you got that short-ass little fucker to borrow my camera, and then Ray-Ray here tells me he saw someone he couldn't quite make out climbing through your window after curfew last night, so, um, I don't give a fuck about the camera. I just want you to tell me who was in your room last night. I don't know. ♪♪ See, um, this is what I hate about being reasonable. What I said about Raymond not hurting you... I take it back. Drown the bitch. No. No, please! Please don't! Aah! No. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
