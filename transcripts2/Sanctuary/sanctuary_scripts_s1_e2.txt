 Hel? Hel, it's me, Siri. I'm in the sanatorium. It's in Italy. I'd really love it if you could come and visit me. [Chuckles] Hey. Welcome to Himmelstal. Your thumbprint will give you access to all areas. Hi, Margot. This is my sister, Hel. Oh, Rose-Red and Snow-White, huh? Siri, why did you ask me here? I thought that you could just be me here for one day.

 I have a girlfriend. She's in the hospital, and I need to see her. No! ♪♪ Helena: You fucking bitch. You just went and did it anyway? This is not as easy as you said it would be. Jack: We found Svalla Inberg. Corin: Don't play games, Siri. You said you'd get it right back to me. I'm not Siri. I'm her sister, okay? We swapped, and she went to... Ah! Hey!

 ♪♪ [Glass shatters] [Computers beeping, indistinct conversations] ♪♪ Siri. Siri Brant. ♪♪ Wake up! ♪♪ [Gasps] I said, "Wake up and shut up." [Buzzer] Man: What's going on? Siri was talking to herself. She was just having a nightmare. Well, there's nothing more fucking tedious than other people's dreams. [Coughs] I'm... I'm... I'm not Siri. I'm Hel, her sister. What's happening? Man: Margot threw water on Siri. [Spits] Margot, if you can't behave, we'll cuff your other hand, too. You caused enough trouble tonight. And you might want to cut her a little slack. While you were unconscious, she dragged you out of the fire. She saved your life. Behave, Margot. Helena: No. Wait! Wait! Don't make me do it again. [Breathing heavily] Alright, what do you want? Out... I want out. Oh, well, good luck with that, peach. You and every other bugger in here. I mean, what do you want with me? Nothing. ♪♪ Why did you save me? I was awake. You were unconscious. I know things about you, Siri. You could've had a nice tidy up if I'd croaked in the fire. ♪♪ So what was your angle? No fucking angle, okay? I just did it. Well, you don't do anything without thinking about it, Siri Brant. You've always got an angle. I'm not Siri. I told you I'm Hel, her sister. Yeah, and I'm Titania, queen of the fucking fairies. ♪♪ Redpath: We could've lost the entire wing. Yes, and Siri Brant, of all people, does us a good turn. Do you remember, I did question from a security point of view if it was wise to let the sister come and see her? Siri is just using all this drama as an excuse to play one of her games. She's pretending to be her sister. Mm.She's saying they swapped. Of course she is. But could she be telling the truth? Plus, the security system is foolproof. You know that. Yeah. Still, it's a shame she left early. I would've liked to have talked to her privately, get into the whole nature-and-nurture thing. ♪♪ Nature, nurture? Yeah. Is a psychopath born or made? This was a chance to interview identical twins, one neurotypical, one not. Oh. Maybe we can get the sister to come back. What was her name again? Helena? No, my reservation will still be the same. Yeah. That's why you're in security, Jack. Exactly. [Woman singing indistinctly] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Horn honks] Excuse me? Hello, sir. Could you... ♪♪ [Horn honking] ♪♪ [Speaking foreign language] [Horn honks] [Speaking Italian] Oh, come on. ♪♪ Idiota. [Breathing heavily] Siri? Oh, I'm sorry. Dr. Fisher wants to see you. Hmm. What? Dr. Fisher wants to see you. Keep the bowl. It's better. Let's go. Here we are. Well, hello. She's having a bad reaction to the tranquilizer. Dr. Fisher: Oh. Sorry you're not feeling yourself. I should've given you more time to recover, but I really just wanted to pass by and say, "Thank you." We all know that Margot insists on killing herself with her tobacco addiction. My lungs, doc, my choice. Uh-huh. Uh, well, sure, your choice, but it's not cool to nearly take out Siri and half the medical wing because of your choice. But I... I can dream big. Mm-hmm. Dream as big as you want, but you are officially banned from smoking cigarettes. From now on, it's, uh, vape or, uh, nicotine gum. I'm sure your neighbor is going to sleep much better knowing that you're not falling asleep smoking cigarettes. Isn't that right, Siri? I'm not Siri. Oh. I just came here to... So I've heard. Mm. [Groans] I don't think I've ever seen, uh, her react this way to sedatives before. Let's find out what she's used in the past and make sure she doesn't get that type any more. No, really, I-I'm not. We swapped. Uh-huh. Siri, you promised to stay cool if we let your twin come to visit, didn't you? I amthe twin! I amHelena, okay? She... She left me here. She left me trapped in here, and then she took off. Siri, deep breaths, calm place. Why don't you listen to me? I'm trying to explain. Dr. Silva is returning from leave today. He'll be the best person for you to have this conversation with, yeah? Again, thank you very much. You're showing wonderful progress. [Birds chirping] Dr. Kowalska.Dr. Kowalska: Hello. Welcome to Himmelstal.Hi. Hi. Welcome. I'm... I'm a little late. Oh, no worries. I'll help you with your bag. Can I help you? Sure. ♪♪ It's amazing. Well, "Himmelstal" means "heavenly valley," our own slice of heaven. ♪♪ ♪♪ I don't like owing people. Owing you... makes me all itchy. Yeah, you don't like it? Not a bit. Then pay me back. Here comes the angle. It's not a big thing. As the priest said to the altar boy. [Scoffs] ♪♪ Pretend that you believe that I'm not Siri. How would you make this Dr. Fisher believe me? Jesus Christ, you carry on like this, you'll end up on the mushroom farm. What's the mushroom farm? Do you want to end up hit with the chemical course like little Einstein over there, pissing in your pants, brain like mashed potato? No, I... I just want to get out. You'll get out the same way as the rest of us, peach... in a coffin. This is Himmelstal. No escapes... ever. No, they can't just keep the wrong people in here. I'm going to talk to the doctors. Right, and if they don't bite? Well, then, I'm going to call someone. And how are you going to call? Well, I'm going to call with the phones by the reception. Oh, but they're in category two, peach, and we're in category one. So you be a good girl, and you'll get sent back. ♪♪ Siri, we need to do another physical check before you see Dr. Silva. Yeah, sure. ♪♪ Dr. Fisher: Yes. Dr. Fisher? Yeah. Hello, Doctor. Dr. Kowalska. Sophia, call me Martin. We're not big on formality within the team. I'm so sorry I'm late. Oh, don't worry about it. Uh, have a seat. It's a bad way to start my first day. [Clears throat] Well, as I told you in our interview, I think of ourselves as a great, big happy family, and families cut themselves slack, especially on the small things. [Drone whirring] Yeah, we're all watched here on campus, for our safety as much as theirs. It's a good thing we're well-funded. Come on. I'll give you the grand tour. Hmm. Good. Your numbers are actually better than they usually are. Yeah, of course, because I'm not Siri. You have to take that up with the doctors. Hmm? [Velcro rips] Please, can you sit? Breathe. [Inhales deeply] Again. [Inhales deeply] Good. Doesn't sound too bad, given the smoke you inhaled. Wait. There's blood on your shoes. I was changing the dressing on poor Svalla Inberg. ♪♪ How is she? She's still in a coma. ♪♪ Okay. You are in good shape, hmm? Um, so that means I can go back to category two? Uh, not yet. Dr. Silva needs to sign off on your mental state. You can see him as soon as he arrives. ♪♪ [Rain falling, birds chirping] ♪♪ I warned you. Our little perch in the Dolomites is hardly Harvard. But it's much more beautiful. Oh, you have a lot of activities here. Yes... happy bodies, happy minds, right? Most of the patients are category two. They live here in the valley and in the residential cabins down in the village, along with some covertly embedded researchers. Our category-one patients live here in... Are locked down here in the sanatorium. Uh, with good behavior, they can get promoted to category two. That's right. [Chuckles] I read the orientation packet, Doctor. It's your in... Incentive ladder. Right. It's so nice to have somebody who shows up prepared, and it's Martin. Hmm. So, Martin, the people here are all inmates? Yes, they're all here serving life sentences for crimes committed in their home countries. Mm. It's better to have them living here productively where they can be studied rather than having them rot away in some prison, right? By "productively," does that mean they have to work? Well, it's optional. It's a way for them to earn special privileges, extra money, like these two fellas here. Morning. Morning.Morning. [Birds chirping] [Bell tolling] [Upbeat music playing] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Sighs] [Music continues] ♪♪ [Music stops] ♪♪ [Sighs] Big knife for such a small person. ♪♪ What do you mean, small? I mean, you're in proportion and everything, but you're short. You must have realized. Fuck off. I'm just trying to make conversation. We're having classes on, uh, empathy and stuff. ♪♪ [Grunts] Where's the camera? It's not here. I'll get it later. Later just makes it more overdue. Do you need it now, like, right now? It's not about what we need. It's about what you agreed on. Just... tell Carol I'll bring it up. ♪♪ I'll make it straight. That's your message? That's my message. ♪♪ Corin will make it straight. ♪♪ [Scoffs] ♪♪ You should take better care of your blade. A workman is only as good as his tools, and if I was so keen to get on the wrong side of Carol, I'd keep mine a lot sharper than that. ♪♪ Must be wondering why I hired you, no? Top of your class but barely got your doctorate, and your professors didn't give you glowing reviews. I'm painfully aware of all this. They also rejected your PhD paper on female psychopathy. Three times. But you kept resubmitting it. Because I believe it has validity. I think there's a gender bias. There... There's a gender bias in diagnosis of psychopaths. So I assume that was why you hired me. No, I hired you because you're not afraid to think outside the box. Our little community here can become quite incestuous, and because we have so much power over our inmates, I needed someone to speak truth to that power. Ah, a devil's advocate. Exactly. The next few weeks, you're going to be shadowing Dr. Silva, Luke. Is he back yet? Yeah, he's just checked in. Good. Would you be so kind as to escort Dr. Kowalska to meet him? Yeah, sure. Uh, you see the grounds are quite big, so sometimes, it takes you a little while just to get your bearings. It's okay. Okay. Keep walking. Alright? It's okay. Now, look. We got CCTV everywhere in category one, most of them in category two. Just don't go into the valley, not on your own, anyway. Morning, sir. So this is the... the art class. Dr. Kowalska: Seems popular. Yeah, well, Dr. Fisher is very keen on letting them express themselves. You don't like art? Eh, it's all Pollocks to me. [Chuckles] It's a very old joke, Mr. Redpath. Yeah, well, I'm a very old guy, Dr. Kowalska. You're not so old. No? No. Well, it's a... A lot to take in. It's a very big campus. It's very good. Walking keeps you fit. Yeah, well, we got some lovely trails for walking... Or running. Do you run? I jog, but reluctantly. I really make myself do it. Yeah, I know what you mean. Well, you know, uh, if you ever want anyone to show you the trails, you know, I run every morning before breakfast... Early bird. This way. [Telephone rings] Mm, that's strange. Ah, here we go. Dr. Silva: Do you think she planted it there for us to find? Dr. Silva, this is Dr. Kowalska. Ah, [Chuckles] my new shadow. Oh, uh, thank you, nurse. I'll make sure she gets it. Welcome to the team. Thank you. Uh, [Chuckles] give me 10 minutes to shower and change, and you can jump right in with our first session, Siri Brant. She's one of our more colorful subjects. She's playing up today. And every day. Uh, interview rooms are that way. See you in 10. Sure. He's another fitness fanatic. You'll get along famously. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Buzzer] Siri. Hi. Hi. Oh, [Chuckles] this is Dr. Kowalska. She'll be shadowing me for the next few weeks. Hey. Hi. Uh, this is a short session just to assess whether you're still suitable for category two and can go back to your cabin, okay? Yeah, and you're Dr. Silva? [Chuckles] Yes, Siri, uh, this is not a mask. It's the real me. [Laughs] Right, um, I know this is going to sound shocking, but I'm not Siri. Yes, I'd heard you'd been saying that. Um, you've been having a lively time while I've been gone. No, but I... I'm not. I'm Hel, her sister. Your twin, Helena, who visited you and left yesterday. No, that... that was Siri. She drugged me. Drugged you? With what? Sleeping pills... Lorazepam... But it doesn't matter. She... She walked out pretending to be me. That's a good one. [Chuckles] Why don't you believe me? Just look at me. Ask me questions. I can prove it. How? Uh, in-instructions... She left me instructions and a note on how to be her. These instructions? Yeah, right. After the fire, nursing staff took her clothes to be cleaned, found these planted in her pockets. It was not planted. Nice touch, Siri. Really well-played. If your time here has improved your condition in only one small way, well, this proves it's in your ability to plan ahead rather than just act impulsively. We can really build on that. You don't believe me. [Chuckles] Siri, with your disorder, um, that's an occupational hazard. I don't have a disorder. Condition, then. I'm sorry. I misspoke. Psychopathy is a condition. I'm sorry. What? Psychopathy is a condition. You were right. I was wrong. ♪♪ You think Siri is a psychopath? ♪♪ Siri is not a psychopath. Siri, you know why we're here, why we talk. No, I mean, she... She's impulsive and... And do you know what that means? ♪♪ Do youthink she's a psychopath? ♪♪ No. You don't even know Siri. ♪♪ Um, right, we don't know each other, but I know psychopaths. [Chuckles] What's so funny? I'm just smiling. Perhaps you could refresh Siri's memory. What do you mean, Doctor? Tell her about psychopathy, just, um, to get to know each other. Siri and I have a very frank relationship. Go on. Well... in simple terms, a psychopath is a person unrestrained by conscience. And in not simple terms? ♪♪ It is a complex disorder with a well-defined set of symptoms, one of which is being manipulative, another of which is being egocentric and grandiose. Both of those might, for example, explain why you insist I go through this charade of justifying myself. Well, maybe I just like charades. Maybe, but that's very glib. Glibness and superficiality are both symptoms. Yeah, I wouldn't know. Being deceitful [Chuckles] is another symptom. It feels like you are trying to make me angry. It... It won't work. Of course not. Shallow emotions... That's another one. [Sighs] Look, I just need you to help me, okay? I don't need you to play games with me. Siri, are you sure? Because psychopaths have a very low threshold for boredom, which means they need excitement. You think I'm doing this for excitement? You think I'm just playing games? I have no fucking idea why you're doing this. See? Absence of empathy, that's another big one. I think perhaps that's enough. I'm almost done. Psychopaths display behavioral problems from childhood and as adults manifest antisocial behavior, which often results in incarceration. It is very specific skill set, great for serial killers, but also for captains of industry, international bankers, fund managers, and all kinds of criminals, including, of course, politicians and presidents. ♪♪ Will that do? Yes, I think that's enough. Thank you, Dr. Kowalska. You're welcome. So you seem to have made a big step by thinking of someone other than yourself and rescuing Margot. ♪♪ It speaks well of our work together, but in conversations like the one you just had with Dr. Kowalska, and given your usual tendency for changing identities, you don't show much progress. So I don't get cleared for category two? [Chuckles] Yes, of course you do. Trouble is your business, after all, like most of our patients here, and I don't believe the level of threat you pose to yourself or others has changed, and you know that's the criteria. So privileges for, uh, category two... restored. [Groans] You are free to go wherever you like in the valley. [Buzzer, door opens]See you later. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Policia. Hi. Is... Is this the police? Sí. Do you speak English? I do. Okay. Good. Um, my name is Helena Brant. I'm being held against my will in a sanatorium called Himmelstal in Trentino. I'm a Swedish citizen, and I... I-I need you to... To alert the Swedish Consulate. What's your name again, please, ma'am? Helena Brant. Where do you find yourself? Himme... Himmelstal, yes, yes, that's it. I'll alert them immediately, ma'am. You will? Yes. Okay. Stay right there. Great. Uh, should I just... I will get in touch... I should just stay here? ...with them as soon as possible. Okay. Yes, ma'am. Okay. Thank you. Okay. We'll take care of it. Thank you so much. Thanks. My pleasure. ♪♪ [Birds chirping] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Sighs] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hey. Hey. What's up? Someone used the phone to contact the police again. Oh, yeah? Just got off the phone with them. They told us they got better things to do than drive up here every time we can't keep control of our patients, you know, same shit. Who do you think it was this time? Hmm. Who do youthink? Siri Brant? Yeah. Again? God, they are like little kids sometimes. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Man speaking indistinctly] ♪♪ [Chatter] Woman: That's Siri... Siri Brant. ♪♪ ♪♪ Hey. Hey, Luck. Come here. What are you up to? Hey, sexy. Ah! Ow! What the fuck? Stop touching me! You said we had something. [Scoffs] It's me, Corin. Uh, hey. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry. Sure. Fuck. ♪♪ I need it back. What? Don't play games, Siri. This is serious. I went out on a limb to get you that damn thing, and if I don't get it back to Carol, I'm in big trouble. Listen, I don't know... No, just get the camera back. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Exhales sharply] ♪♪ You want to watch yourself, peach. What? Dicky-bird tells me you were seen having a bit of aggro with your little friend, Corin. That was nothing. Not like you to wash your dirty linen in public. Looks weak. People see you weak, they're going to remember they want payback. You've made a lot of enemies. Everyone always wants payback. Well, not me. ♪♪ [Scanner beeps, buzzer] [Gate creaks] ♪♪ Dr. Kowalska: Fuck. [Speaking Italian] [Knock on door] Digging an escape tunnel?[Both laugh] No, the... the sockets... Oh, I know. It seems we have to see Siri Brant again. I thought you might want to have a look at her file. Ah, yeah, thanks. Listen. I... I wanted to apologize. [Scoffs] For what? We're... We're both pretending it wasn't me who flipped you off on the road. I was so late. I was frustrated because I was going to make very bad impression my first day, and it was so childish. I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm sorry. [Chuckles] I was going, uh, to give you a peace offering. A peace offering? Are... Are... Are we at war? No, but I thought you made me explain psychopathy to Siri Brant as a way of getting back at me. Why would I do that? I... I, uh, I offended you again. [Scoffs] Not again... I, uh, I didn't know it was, uh, you who flipped me off the road. Please take the bottle. [Chuckles] Uh, I don't drink. Oh, [Chuckles] my apology. This is fine, Dr. Kowalska. Everything is fine. Sure. I'll see you later on at the session. Yeah. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Breathing heavily] Fuck. ♪♪ Hey, Siri. Hey. Beautiful day, no? Yeah. You want some coffee? No, thanks. Uh, I'm all good. I... I didn't mean to interrupt you. I'm sorry. Hey, it's okay. It's just Hemingway, and he ain't going anywhere fast. Besides, I read this book three times already, and I'm still trying to figure out what the fish means. [Chuckles] Hey. You all right? It's just... It's just this place is... Yeah, I hear ya. You know, we all get a case of the get-me-outs every now and then. I like to call it cabin fever, and there's no shame in it. ♪♪ Do you know a way to get out of here? [Vehicle approaches] ♪♪ What the hell are they doing up here so far? ♪♪ Hey, guys. Y'all come for the coffee? No, thanks. Siri, Dr. Silva wants to see you. He sent us to pick you up. You were seen running up here like your life depended on it. Is everything all right? I just had to get out. I thought the exercise would de-stress me. Well, hope it worked. You can get a ride with us. Hey, Siri. Look after yourself. All right? ♪♪ Dr. Silva: You called the police, told them you were Helena Brant being held against your will and that they should alert the Swedish Consulate. Yeah, if you would've believed me, I wouldn't have had to do it. Which explains that, uh, sudden concern at the end of last session when you thought I wasn't going to sign you back to category two. The patient phones are a category-two area. I told you the truth. When you said I was a liar, I had no choice. I thought you would've learned your lesson last time, Siri. Local police know all about what you guys try and do. I don't know why you did it again, especially after... I told you why... Because I'm Hel. ♪♪ [Sighs] I told you why... Because I'm Hel. ♪♪ So why? Why does she wants to be Hel so badly? Dr. Fisher: Good question. Uh, dissociative behavior for her own protection. More importantly, her unselfishness in saving Margot from the fire is a sign that your overall approach is working. Don't you think this, um, pretense is a sign of regression? Maybe, or maybe she's just uncomfortable with these new altruistic impulses. Yeah, and she's wearing them as a new identity, as if Siri wouldn't do it, but Hel... Hel would. It could be so fascinating to explore it. I agree. Uh, much better to get her to discard this new fake identity and own her change, don't you think? Siri as Siri. Hmm. Could I question her on my own? Just to try something. I don't think that will be in line with the current course of therapy. Well, I think it's a good idea. Let's shake things up. Dr. Fisher: Sophia is the new girl. Siri thinks she's a new type of girl. Uh, let's see where it takes us. Maybe they'll reach a common ground. Yeah? Sure. [Chuckles] What does she like to drink? A latte for you. I don't drink milk. Siri loves a latte. This is her playing games with the new kid. Maybe you sit down. So long as it's her playing games and not you. Helena: I'd rather stand. I'd never do that to a colleague. I would like to... to talk to you about your childhood. I just want to get out, okay? Uh, and if I screwed up by letting Siri trick me, fine. I'll take the consequences, but I just want you to call the police and call the Swedish Consulate. It's very interesting. I don't care if it's interesting. I just want you to do it. It's really interesting because, Siri, as I read, has a history of doing almost anything to avoid the consequence of her actions. Yeah, see? It's because I'm not Siri. I'm Hel. [Sighs] You don't trust me. I... I understand it. I... I really do, but maybe I could help. What have you got to lose by talking to me about yourself? ♪♪ Hel, please. ♪♪ Thank you. So... you grew up together? Yes. Yes and no. It's complicated. Okay, so simplify it for me. Siri must have talked about our parents. No, I gather Siri never ever wanted to talk about her family. Please tell me about them. They... They split up and each took one of us. ♪♪ ♪♪ My mother was a shrink like you, but American. ♪♪ She had advanced views. Advanced? Yeah, that's what Dad called them. So, you know, we... We grew up in separate countries, saw each other on holidays, mid-summer, our birthdays. I wouldn't call that particularly advanced. Hmm. How was that? It was what it was. I guess every childhood is normal for the child lucky enough to survive it. Why have you never spoken about it before... Your family, childhood, Hel? Because I amHelena. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. If you persist in this, you know what Dr. Silva will do next, don't you? What do you mean? He may downgrade you from category two, put you on medication. Is that what you want? The chemical course? Yeah. Are you really Hel? [Buzzer, door opens] Doctor, would you step out for a moment, please? Yeah, sure. Dr. Silva: Don't make threats on my behalf. I built up trust with Siri. You are jeopardizing it. What if she's telling the truth? [Chuckles] Not possible and... and not the point. Why? Why? I've spent almost a year building a rapport with Siri. Her identical twin was allowed to visit. Maybe that was a mistake. Failing to consider that could be confirmation bias. [Sighs] ♪♪ Is this because I didn't take your bottle of wine? No! This is because you all may have given a dangerous inmate an inch and don't want to consider the fact she may have taken a mile. Hey! Hey, guys. Are you in there? I can prove it! Can we go back to work, huh? ♪♪ I can prove who I am! [Buzzer, door opens] I can prove it. I can prove who I am. I've been... I've been an idiot. Well, Dr. Kowalska should be pleased. She was just telling us we must have made a mistake. I'm afraid the doctor is making a beginner's error, jumping to conclusions before she has all the facts. But, no, the only fact that matters is the thumbprint. You took my thumbprint when I first got here, right? Yes. Check it. It will prove who I am. Okay. She's right. Identical twins share the same DNA, but their fingerprints are always different. Great. Let's check it, then. Fine. That's Helena Brant signing out. No, that's Siri. ♪♪ And that's her ID checked with her thumbprint. How can that be? ♪♪ Put your thumb there, please. ♪♪ [Scanner beeping] ♪♪ [Computer beeps] Thank you. ♪♪ I'm afraid your bluff has been called, Siri. What do you mean? I'm not... I'm not bluffing. ♪♪ Nice try, Siri. With you, there's never a dull moment. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
