 Should I tell you who you really are? Housebreaker, robber, liar? I'm glad you're okay. Helena: So fucking stupid. Siri killed my dog with his hammer, didn't she? The photo of Svala's injuries, there was a hammer in it. If there is blood on the hammer, you will have to call the police to... To investigate it, right? To... to check fingerprints and everything. Luke: Sure, of course. Carol: Raymond there brought me a hammer

 after your kung-fu cabaret in the church. - He has the hammer! - You said she'd behave! In his bag! Raymond, come here! You went to a lot of trouble trying to get it, huh? - He's clean. - No. Tomas: I was just playing a game. Do you remember what we said about playing games that hurt people? The kid is your XO contact? You think I'm stupid? Well, if he isn't in the XO, why did he bring me the map? Ray-Ray, get that fucking kid out of here. You may be one crazy bitch, but now I've got your hammer, and you know what? What?

 You're my crazy bitch. Woman: Yeah, there's a parcel for Siri Brant. It's a cake. Do you want me to inspect it? ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Knock on door] Come in. Luke, what happened to you? It's started. What's started? The meeting. Come on. ♪♪ [Panting] ♪♪ Okay, stay. Stay here. ♪♪ And then a group of women came back after a sixth month. It was only women? Yeah, exactly. It was a part of an experiment, and they... Sorry, everyone. I... I must have missed the memo. Not a problem. We were just reviewing Siri's progress. Progress? The impact of my disruptive therapy has been the primary point of our discussion so far. We're talking about her regression, then. Luke, take a breath. I'm fine, Martin. Thank you. I must admit, I find it tricky to talk about Siri's behavior as an improvement. You're right. She's been disruptive, but that's part of the purpose. Wasn't she disrupted by the sister's visit? Her behavior, everything since then has taken a turn for the worse. All right. I think we all sound a little bit disrupted this morning. Why don't we take a break, huh? Perhaps we can reconvene when I've had a chance to factor in my notes into Dr. Kowalska's report on my patient. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Clattering] ♪♪ [Door opens] [Footsteps] ♪♪ Ray-Ray! ♪♪ You hear anything? Raymond: No. In the shed, go check it out. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Nothing here. All right. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Luck whines] [Sighs] [Speaks indistinctly] Don't think I've ever seen young Tomas without his bike before. Well, maybe he got bored of it. Come to think of it, I haven't seen him at all last few days. Vanished into thin air. It's got nothing to do with me. Oh, what's that expression you're trying out there, Siri? I don't think I've ever seen you going for upset before. If you have to kill yourself, it's just as quick go on your porch. Pardon me for breathing. [Grunts] [Luck barks] [Footsteps approaching] - Hey. - Hi. What are you doing under there? Oh, you know, just digging an escape tunnel. You got a parcel. What? From who? I don't know. You need to get it from reception as soon as possible. Luck, come here. [Smooches] Good luck with your tunnel. Come here. [Door buzzes] Siri, no dogs in the main building, please. What's he going to do? I'm only grabbing my parcel. Here you go. It's been opened. Protocol. So is this the one that has to be double-checked? Why does he always order things that look like weapons? Well, he likes to keep us on our toes. Unbox it, then. I-I don't think I have anything sharp enough to cut through this tape. [Gasps] That's why no dogs! Get him down! Get him down! Just forget about it. I'll take care of it. Just get him out! Come here. Good boy, good boy. Don't do that. [Luck growling]No! Luck, Luck, no! No. Who's sending Carol that? He probably ordered it himself, or it's a present, like your cake. It's a cake? Oops. I didn't know it was a surprise. - Hey. - Hey. Is that a gift? I don't know. Look, h-have you seen Tomas anywhere? [Chuckles] Well, you dumped him in it. In what? Did... did Carol do something to him? I don't know. I found his bike outside my place. I chucked it under the house. Oh. You and Siri are more alike than I thought. You better ditch it before you get in some trouble. No, but wait. I'm not sure I want to be around you right now. ♪♪ ♪♪ Luke: Come in. I wanted to apologize. Oh. No wine this time? Listen. I really don't know what happened with the meeting. I-I was sure I CC'd you in. Well, maybe next time you want a meeting about Siri, why don't you tell me first? This way it won't matter whether you forget to add my e-mail address to your fait accompli. Look. Shock therapy, female psychopathy is all my area of expertise. Please, give me a chance. And Siri is my area of expertise, and I can tell you there's no magical cure-all miracle treatment here, even though I do think we might be missing something. Well, so... you think she's telling the truth now? No, I think we should make our judgment calls based on clinical intelligence, not ambition. I haven't heard Martin complain about my methods. I think Dr. Fisher may be a little taken by your passion. [Chuckles] Yeah. Why don't you just say it outright? He's attracted to me. That's what you think. He's attracted to your shiny new ideas, making out Siri as a tool. A useful one. Siri is a patient, not a tool. You know what? I think you're jealous. ♪♪ [Chair scrapes] [Door opens] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Indistinct singing] ♪♪ - Three! - Three! ♪♪ Hey. I thought you didn't want to be around me. I'm here to get the bike. Thanks. No. Carol sent me. Carol? You know I didn't have a choice with Tomas, don't you? I didn't want anything to happen to him. I'm sorry. I'd offer you some cake as a thank you, but... [Chuckles] ...it's a bit messy. Um, what exactly this cake ever do to you? I don't like marzipan. Oh, you don't like marzipan. Still, a little extreme, isn't it? Well, did Siri ever tell you about prinsesstarta? Princess who? [Chuckling] It's a birthday cake. Wait. Is it your birthday? No, it's coming up the week after next. Oh, so it's just a cake. No, it's a birthday cake. It's a thing. Prinsesstarta, it's a Swedish thing. Okay, so what's the problem? Problem is that I hate it, and Siri loves it, but she always made a fuss about me choosing kladdkaka instead. Oh, so the problem is that you like, um, kladdkaka more? Kladdkaka, yeah. Who doesn't love too much chocolate? Let me guess. Siri? She might be a psychopath, but she's not a pervert. She loves chocolate, but she always choose prinsesstarta 'cause she knew I hated it so, you know, she could eat more of the cake. Clever Siri. [Sighs] She's taunting me. There was a message? The cake is the message. "Fuck you. You're trapped in there. I'm out here. I can eat whatever cake I want." Look. When I told you that you reminded me of Siri, I was joking, but I do believe this place is making us sick. We have to get out of here. Tell me about it. We need just two days. Your kamikaze plan? No! I want to escape. I don't want to die. Okay, so I guess you have a better plan, then? I-I-I need to convince Dr. Silva. I need to make sure I get the hammer so... So he can take it to the police and start a proper investigation. Carol will never hand you over the hammer because he knows it's important for you. That's his power. It won't work. You need another plan. Luke: It looks delicious. Presentation could be better. You heard I'd been sent this? I know you think we follow your every move, but I don't get a daily report. Okay. It... It arrived today. It's from Siri. You need to find out where it was ordered from, who paid, with what card. We're doctors, not the police. Okay, then... then... Then let me check my credit card online. That way we can see where she's been spending money, where she is. I would love to get to the bottom of your concerns, but you know better than to ask me to allow you Internet access. Then you look it up! Find out what she's been doing on the outside. She must have been creating her usual chaos. Or maybe a counter argument is it's you creating the chaos, casting yourself as the victim, deploying the smoke and mirrors. Well, I-I can't have sent this cake to myself. Really? Are you sure? Okay, then check the logs. I haven't used the phones. This is... I know it's from Siri. She's taunting me. We have a history with this cake. Maybe somebody sent you Siri's favorite cake, hmm? Your favorite cake. Well, don't you think it's weird that there is no card, then? This is classic Siri mind games. Fine. If it'll help bring clarity, I'll have security look into it. Good. I don't know how far you think my resources stretch, but I can't file a trace on a package or a payment. What? Can... Can I call you back? Yeah, sorry. Yeah, that package for Siri Brandt, who checked it for security? Um, I did. Why? Is there a problem? Was there a card with the cake? Yeah, I think so. There was or there wasn't. Which one? Yes, yes. There was a card, yeah. Yeah, my guy says there was definitely a card. I mean, let's be fair. Who are you going to believe, me or Siri? What? She had... she had dropped the box, like, here. ♪♪ Mop it. ♪♪ [Knock on door] [Door buzzes] Dr. Silva. Thank you. Wait. There's a card? Do you mind if I, uh... ♪♪ ♪♪ [Sighs] Fuck. It's a very nice card from a very nice sister wishing you a very nice birthday. Is this a joke to you? No. I don't think there's anything, Siri. Don't fucking act like you care. You don't care at all. ♪♪ ♪♪ Shit. Ah, fuck! ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Hey. Hi. When can I get into Carol's? You can't. Well, he doesn't order a flashy, new telescope and then sit inside. He's got to be heading out at night. So what? So his cabin will be empty. I have a map of the blind spots. I just need a time. To break in and steal the hammer? It's better for you if I don't tell you the plan. Just can you find it out for me or not? I don't need to find it out. He told me already. I'm going with him. I didn't take you for a stargazer. I'm just there to carry the telescope, or that's the story. Well, w-what do you reckon the real story is? I don't know. With Carol, you never know. It can be a game, can be a test. Maybe he does want to see the stars, or maybe he's burying something he needs to hide. I don't know. Look, the worst thing that can be is that he knows about us. He knows that I'm working with you. Well, then, don't go. It could be dangerous. It's Carol. I have to go. Look, you're right. There's an easier chance. Just be sure to get in as soon as we leave. Hmm. You get the hammer, and you get out, okay? Okay. Just be careful. Yeah. ♪♪ Man: Tomas. Please. Let's talk. Sorry. Isn't Carol Dr. Fisher's patient? To my knowledge, yes. Thank you. This is, uh, Tomas' session. Uh, where is he? I wanted to come myself and explain. He won't be coming in today. Uh, this isn't how this works. Has something happened? Carol, should I be worried, hmm? Like his little tracker there will tell you? He's all holed up at mine. He did a bad thing, doesn't want to face the music. What bad thing? Well, he didn't want me to tell you, but he nearly hurt someone again. Who? It's okay, it's okay. They're fine. But he knows I'm mad, and you're gonna be a lot madder. If there's a regression, then more than ever, he should be coming to his sessions. Well, I'm talking to him about it. Carol, you don't get to make those decisions. Doc... you're a smart man. You done a lot of good for him, but I'm the one that knows what's going on up there, so I'm helping him through this. It's part of my deal, right? Well, uh, doesn't helping him entail getting him to check in for his sessions? Well, I'm checking in for him. In loco parentis, right? ♪♪ [Door buzzes] I'm so amazed. You ride that thing on these hills? It's okay so long as the drivers you meet aren't on a power trip. But you like living on the edge, don't you, putting children at risk? Um, sorry? The patient mentor program? You've left a child in our care in the hands of a psychopath? You're spying in on my sessions now, Dr. Kowalska. That's not very professional, is it? I'm so sorry, Luke. I have to report it. [Chuckles] You're familiar with our incentive ladder, increasing responsibility both for Carol and Tomas. We believe it pays off. Then give Carol a hamster, not a boy. Why don't you take it up with Martin? It's his idea, and I'm sure he'll find your disapproval very, um... attractive. ♪♪ [Keyboard music plays] [Luck growls] ♪♪ [Music stops] Hi, Margot. Yeah, yeah, yeah, beautiful night. Cut the platitudes, will you? You're wasting valuable smoking times today, yeah? All good, Siri? All good. ♪♪ ♪♪ May I? Sophia, you're here awfully late. ♪♪ How can I help you? I've just heard about Tomas and Carol. And you find it, what, contentious? Well, unconventional at least. Unconventional, exactly, taking a mature psychopath and putting him with a young one, seeing if something positive happens. It's called reparenting. But it's... It's very, very risky. Not really. I mean, it's all being very closely monitored. We have hosts observing all the time. Plus, Tomas has an ankle bracelet. What are you thinking? You think we should stop? I think, in the right hands... it could even expand. I like the way you think. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Grunts] ♪♪ Carol: Hurry up. ♪♪ Come on. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ We should have brought something to eat. I'm already starving. Stop your fucking moaning. You're going to have dinner on the table when we get back. What do you mean? Tomas is slaving away as we speak. I hope it's trout 'cause I can't eat any more fucking rabbit. That's for sure. So wait. Is Tomas cooking? Yeah. Him and that host, you know, the big goofy one? Kid's a good little chef these days. His butchery sucks, but it tastes fucking good. [Grunts] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Grunts] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Clattering] ♪♪ [Footsteps] ♪♪ [Clatters] [Footsteps] ♪♪ [Footsteps continue] ♪♪ Hey! Hey, a shooting star! Ha! My nana used to say that someone died when you see one. Carol: Yeah. Your nana didn't know shit. It's just a satellite. Oh. Keep an eye on its track, and you'll likely see another one come along in a few minutes. It's the A-train, six birds in a row, like on a rail. They call it that because the lead satellite crosses the equator at 1:30 in the afternoon. "A" for afternoon, right? You know your shit. Fuck. Oh, shit. What do we do now? Well, we can either sit here all night and stare at the ass end of a cloud or go eat. I know which one I want to do. Pass me that case. Let's get the fuck out of here. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Clattering, footsteps] [Door closes] ♪♪ [Boy grunts, falls down steps] [Breathing shakily] ♪♪ ♪♪ Shit. Hey. Hey! Fuck. Wake up. Tomas! Tomas, wake up. Wake... [Knock on door] Man: Tommy, how's it going with... Oh, my god. How's it going with the cooking? Shit. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Tom, Tommy. Tommy, Tommy, wake up. Wake up, Tommy, Tommy. [Footsteps] Carol: Now bring it up here. I want to get it inside the house. My dinner's got to be ready. ♪♪ Tomas! ♪♪ [Grunts] ♪♪ [Coughs] ♪♪ [Bird cries] [Panting] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Well, look who's here. Morning, Enzo. Morning. You're up early. Couldn't sleep. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Water running] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Knocking] Ohh. Love's young dream. Bit early for you, isn't it? Or were you hoping to start the day with a bang? What? Hot roll, full English. A little spot of the mornification. I don't get it. What, a hunk like you? You're not asking the right people, poppet. Hey. What's going on? What did you do to Tomas? Nothing. Why? Carol and I got back, and we found Tomas in a bloody heap. He looked like he'd smashed his skull. Is he dead? I don't know. He was not moving, and Carol sent me out. Did you at least get the hammer? Was it worth it? When I told you how to get in, I didn't think you could do something like that. What? You knew he was gonna be there? Seriously? Not until after I left. Oh, really? 'Cause, to me, it fucking sounds like you... You were setting me up. That's what it sounds like. You know what? You're right. You're right. You should fucking keep your distance. Hey. ♪♪ Do you hear yourself? A kid might be dead, and you're here throwing shit at me. Who the fuck are you? ♪♪ [Door opens] ♪♪ Luck. Oh, you're a lovely boy, aren't you? Luck. Is he yours? Sort of. Sorry. I know another boy who would like to meet you. ♪♪ Mrs. Nicht, I'm so sorry to keep you waiting. What is it? Well, I'm sorry. Uh... ♪♪ Tomas isn't available today. But I've come all this way. It's been arranged for weeks. I don't understand why I can't see Tomas. Your son's sessions have been canceled for this entire week. I'll look into it. Is it a punishment? Has Tomas done something? Mrs. Nicht, there's nothing to worry about. Is he hurt? Tomas is going to be fine. Why don't we go up to my office, where we can talk? - You doing all right, Siri? - Yeah. I was just... Actually, Jack, I was hoping to grab you next. I got something I want to talk about. Matter of fact, it concerns Siri here, so maybe the three of us can have a little chat. Yeah, sure. I'll be in my office. ♪♪ You come shit in my house, I'm gonna burn yours to the fucking ground. ♪♪ ♪♪ So, Carol, what was it you wanted to share? ♪♪ There's something you should know. We have a resident in here who's a danger to her fellow patients. Well, I think we could all agree that that applies to most of our patients. Yeah, but most of us don't act on it. Siri here has caused serious injury. Fuck, man. I'd go so far as to call it attempted murder. Now, I don't think you can go around making those accusations without... without proof. Yeah. Which is why I brought this with me. ♪♪ Wait, b-brought what? I found something I thought you should have. See, I don't like my friends getting hurt. No, I-I didn't mean to hurt anyone. I promise. ♪♪ Siri's been trying to hide this, and I think you can see why. I'm sure you'll find Svala's DNA on it. That looks like blood to me. Anything you want to say about this? No, no. I-I-I... I had nothing to do with this. [Sighs] Okay. [Sighs] You can go. Of course, I'll, uh... I'll be sure to let Dr. Fisher know how helpful you've been. Thank you. Isn't this when you're supposed to arrest her or something? We'll follow due process, Carol. Just like any other patient. Yeah, right. Okay. [Button clicks] Yeah, put me through to the police, please. Yeah, hi. It's, uh, Jack Redpath here from the sanatorium. Uh, could you put me through to Inspector Gatti, please? Inspector, yeah, I think we've uncovered, uh, some evidence that may show that one of our clients was deliberately assaulted. It needs sent in for testing. Um, if, um... if I bring it through to reception, could you send an officer to pick it up, please? Okay. Yeah, sí. Hey, grazie mille. Ciao. [Sighs] That hammer will prove me innocent. Just wait here for a second, Siri. [Door opens, closes] [Door opens] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Hammer thuds] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
