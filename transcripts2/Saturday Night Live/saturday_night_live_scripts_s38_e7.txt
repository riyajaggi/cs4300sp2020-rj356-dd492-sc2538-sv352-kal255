 Saturday Night Live (1975–…): Season 38, Episode 7 - Anne Hathaway/Rihanna - full transcript 
 After a defeated Mitt Romney (Sudeikis) goes on a lactose binge, Anne Hathaway hosts: the SNL cast joins her in a faux song from "Les Mis," and she plays a new best friend on a teen talk show, a woman transfixed by a dancing Japanese zombie, a McDonald's manager about to announce layoffs, an addled Carrie Mathison in a spoof of "Homeland," Katie Holmes guesting on "Ellen," and the woman posing for Grant Woods's "American Gothic." President Obama (Pharoah), two gay lobstermen from Maine, and Drunk Uncle appear on "Weekend Update." Rihanna sings "Diamonds" and "Stay." Flaritin, a pill for fake allergies, sponsors the show.
