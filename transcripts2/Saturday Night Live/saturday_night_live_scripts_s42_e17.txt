 SINCE I WAS GROWING UP. A LOT OF PVERTY IS WHITE NOW. ISN'T THAT CRAZY. YOU LIKE THAT I BOMBED SYRIA? >> I SURE DO, SIR, BUT I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT MY JOB.

I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE YOU PEOPLE WORK IN COAL FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIVES. AND YOUR KIDS WILL WORK IN COAL AND YOUR GRANDKIDS. IT'S GOING TO BE INCREDIBLE. >> MR. PRESIDENT, THANK YOU SO MUCH, BUT ALL WE WANT ARE GOOD JOBS. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE IN COAL. >> SORRY, IT'S ALL COAL. IN TRUMP'S AMERICA, MEN WORK IN TWO PLACES. COAL MINES AND GOLDMAN SACHS. CAREFUL, I'M CUTTING ALL JOB KILLING REGULATIONS. I'M PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT AS OF TODAY, YOUR COAL MINES WILL HAVE NO REGULATIONS. NONE. IT'S A FREE-FOR-ALL. HOW ABOUT YOU. ARE YOU GLAD THAT I BOMBED SYRIA. >> I GUESS SO. I FOUND OUT MY PREMIUMS HAVE GONE UP AND I HAVE TO DRIVE 90 MINUTES TO SEE A DOCTOR.

I AM TALKING WITH THE FREEDOM CAUCUS AND WE ARE GOING TO GET RID OF IT? >> MY HEALTH CARE? ALL OF IT? >> ALL OF IT. GONE. AFTER WE ARE DONE. YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO DRIVE TO SEE A DOCTOR AGAIN. HOW DOES THAT SOUND? >> I TRUST YOUR JUDGMENT, SIR. THERE MUST BE SOME REASON YOU ARE A BILLIONAIRE. >> WE THINK EXACTLY ALIKE. I SAY QUIETLY TO MYSELF, ALL THE TIME ACTUALLY. THERE MUST BE SOME REASON I'M A BILLIONAIRE. WHO IS NEXT UP? >> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY WIFE WHO IS ADDICTED TO PAIN KILLERS. >> SUSAN RICE.

CRAZY. >> LIKE I WAS SAYING, MY WIFE STAYS BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL REHAB PROGRAM. >> DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. WE WILL GET RID OF IT. >> YOU ARE GETTING RID OF IT? >> JUNKING IT. JUNKED.

FEATURING -- MIKEY DAY, ALEX MOFFAT, MELISSA VILLASENOR, MUSICAL GUEST -- THE CHAINSMOKERS AND YOUR HOST -- LOUIS C.K. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ♪♪♪ LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LOUIS C.K. ♪♪♪ >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YES, THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S APPROPRIATE. HERE'S A JOKE. WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD? BECAUSE THERE IS A BLACK GUY WALKING BEHIND HIM. AND HE WAS NERVOUS. HE WAS NEW TO THE CITY, THIS CHICKEN, AND HE WAS LIKE "I FEEL LIKE HE IS FOLLOWING ME." BUT THEN HE THOUGHT IF I CROSS THE ROAD, THEN IF HE CROSSES THE ROAD, HE DEFINITELY FOLOWING ME. SO HE CROSSES THE ROAD. THE BLACK GUY WENT HOME, HE'S JUST LIVING HIS LIFE. AND THE CHICKEN IS LIKE "I'M SUCH A RACIST." HE FELT BAD. ABOUT A MONTH LATER A BLACK GUY ATE THE CHICKEN. DIFFERENT BLACK GUY. I'M JUST TELLING YOU WHAT HAPPENED. BY THE WAY, THIS JOKE IS NOT RACIST. DON'T BE AFRAID. THIS IS NOT A RACIST JOKE. THE CHICKEN WAS RACIST. THE CHICKEN WAS DEFINITELY -- BUT THAT'S CHICKENS. CHICKENS ARE VERY, SORT OF, CLOSED DOWN, SORT OF SUSPICIOUS, PREJUDICE PEOPLE. YOU KIND OF CAN'T BLAME THEM CONSIDERING THAT THEIR SPECIES MURDER RATE IS 100%. THAT'S WHY CHICKENS ARE LIKE -- NO FRIENDLY CHICKENS. YOU CAN FEED THE SAME CHICKEN EVERY DAY. I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT, YOU BLACK SON OF A BITCH, I'M NOT COMING OVER THERE. I'M NOT IN YOUR SOUP YET, YOU JEW. I LIKE ANIMALS. I LIKE WONDERING ABOUT ANIMALS. I LIKE WONDERING WHAT THEY ARE THINKING. YOU CAN ASK ABOUT ANY ANIMAL AND THE CONVERSATION IS OVER. I WONDER IF ANIMALS ARE AWARE OF THEIR LIVES. LIKE, IS A GIRAFFE UP THERE GOING, "WHOA!" IT'S TOO HIGH! HEY, HORSE. HORSE! >> WHAT, MAN? >> LOOK AT MY NECK! THAT'S WHY HORSES MAKE THAT NOSE. YOU ARE NEAR A HORSE AND HE DOES THAT, THAT'S BECAUSE YOU SUCK. DOES A MOOSE LOOK DIFFERENT WHEN IT'S SURPRISED? DID YOU SEE A MOOSE? THEY HAVE THIS -- I SAW A MOOSE ONCE IN PERSON. OR IN MOOSE. MAYBE I WAS PROJECTING BECAUSE I WAS LIKE OH, MY GOSH, A MOOSE AND HE WAS GOING OH, MY GOD, I'M A MOOSE! EVERY MOOSE LOOKS LIKE A DUDE WHO GOT TURNED INTO A MOOSE BEFORE YOU LOOKED AT HIM. I WAS THINKING OF BUYING A GOAT. BECAUSE I WANT TO HAVE A TRASH CAN THAT I CAN MAKE LOVE TO. THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO BUY A GOAT. I CAN DO THAT WITH A TRASH CAN I HAVE NOW, BUT I DON'T HAVE A VAGINA. THAT MAKES IT BETTER. I DON'T CARE THAT YOU ARE UPSET. I'M STILL GETTING THE GOAT. I LOVE DOING THIS. STAND-UP COMEDY. I HAVE BEEN DOING IT FOR 32 YEARS NOW. IT'S BEEN GOING GREAT FOR FOUR YEARS, 28 YEARS IT WAS A STRUGGLE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, I WAS HAPPY WHEN I WAS STRUGGLING. I WAS. BECAUSE WHEN YOUR LIFE SUCKS, IT JUST SUCKS AND YOU LIVE IT. WHEN IT GETS BETTER, YOU START GETTING UNHAPPY. THEN YOU'RE UPSET. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. LIKE, NOW I STAY IN BEAUTIFUL FIVE-STAR HOTELS AND I'M MISERABLE. I USED TO STAY IN MOTELS. NOT EVEN LIKE A NICE -- LIKE A MOTEL 6. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT. LIKE A NOT EVEN A NAME. JUST MOTEL. LIKE THEY BUILT IT AND ONE GUY IS LIKE "WHAT SHOULD WE NAME IT?" THE OTHER GUY IS LIKE, "WHAT?" LAST TIME YOU TOOK A DUMP, DID YOU NAME IT? YOU KNOW THE MOTELS ON THE HIGHWAY AND YOU SAY, WHO IS INSIDE OF THAT? RIGHT ON THE HIGHWAY. LIKE, THE DOOR OPENS ONTO THE HIGHWAY AND ATRUCK TAKES THE DOOR --. AND WHEN YOU GET IN THE SHOWER, YOU ARE DIRTIER NOW. THEY GIVE YOU SOAP AND YOU HAVE TO PEEL OUST PAPER AND IT MAKES A RASH. YOU CAN WRITE YOUR NAME IN SKIN DISEASE WITH THE SOAP. AND THERE'S ALWAYS TWO BEDS AND ONE BED HAS A BIG POOL OF SPERM RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. JUST A BIG DEEP POOL WITH A CURRENT. HIGH TIDE AT THE SPERM POOL! WHERE'S THE BOAT? I STAYED IN, LIKE, IN MOTELS LIKE THAT FOR YEARS AND I WAS HAPPY. BECAUSE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? COMPLAIN TO THE MOTEL? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO CALL THE FRONT DESK? "I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER." "WELL, HE'S DEAD. SOMEBODY DUCT TAPED HIM TO A CHAIR AND SHOT HIM IN THE HEAD BECAUSE HE OWED HIM $15." NOW I STAY AT BEAUTIFUL HOTELS AND I'M MISERABLE BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE FANCY HOTEL STUFF. THEY TIE YOUR BATHROBE INTO A SWAN AND I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU CALL ROOM SERVICE THEY SAY A LONG FLOWERY HELLO BEFORE YOU TALK ABOUT FOOT. YOU CALL DOWN TO ROOM SERVICE, THEY'RE LIKE, "HELLO, THIS ROOM SERVICE --" [ UNINTELIGIBLE ] I HATE IT. STOP IT! I NEVER LET THEM FINISH. IT'S LIKE, "HELLO, ROOM SERVICE --" STOP, STOP, STOP! THANKS, I'D LIKE SOME COFFEE! I'M MEAN. YOU STAY IN THE HOTELS AND YOU ARE USED TO IT AND ONE TIME MY LAUNDRY WASN'T THERE. SO I CALLED HOUSEKEEPING. NOW THEY DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE ALL FANCY AT HOUSEKEEPING. THIS IS HOW SHE ANSWERS THE PHONE, SHE GOES, "HELLO?" AND I ACTUALLY SAID THIS TO HER, I SAID, "DO YOU WANT TO TRY THAT AGAIN?" YEAH. I'M TELLING YOU THINGS ABOUT ME. I WAS LIKE, "DID I REACH YOU ON YOUR PERSONAL PHONE TODAY?" SO SHE SAID -- SHE GOES, "WHAT DO YOU NEED, SIR?" AND I SAID, "WELL, I GAVE YOU MY LAUNDRY YESTERDAY." SHE SAID "YOU DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME." I WAS LIKE, OH, MY GOD, I'M SO EXCITED ABOUT HOW MAD I GET TO BE NOW. I SAID, "I GAVE MY LAUNDRY TO YOUR DEPARTMENT AND I WAS PROMISED. LIKE IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT YOU GET YOUR LAUNDRY. IT'S BEEN LONGER THAN 24 HOURS. SHE SAID, "WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT?" SO I SAID, "OKAY, LISTEN, FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN HEAR IN MY VOICE THAT I'M WHITE." AND BY THE WAY, I'LL DEFEND THAT RIGHT NOW. I'LL DEFEND THAT. BECAUSE LOOK, IT'S WRONG THAT WHITE PEOPLE GET PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT. IT'S WRONG. BUT AS LONG AS THEY DO, WHAT'S GOING ON AT THIS HOTEL? I'M SUPPOSED TO GET THE BEST BECAUSE I'M WHITE WHICH IS AWFUL AND LONG, BUT WHERE IS IT RIGHT NOW? SO SHE GETS SICK OF ME. SHE SAYS, "DO YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER?" I SAID YES. SO THE MANAGER COMES ON, "HELLO? IT'S NED --" [ UNINTELIGIBLE ] I SAID, "I AM VERY UPSET!" SHE WAS LIKE, "OH, I'M SO SORRY, WHITE SIR. WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?" I SAID, "I DON'T HAVE MY LAUNDRY." HE SAID, "AAH!" HE SAID, "I'M GOING TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION." I WAS LIKE, "YES, THAT'S A VERY WHITE THING. I WANT A WHITE INVESTIGATION INTO MY LAUNDRY." SO HE SAID "I WILL CALL YOU BACK IN FIVE MINUTES OR LESS." SO I'M WAITING IN MY ROOM LIKE -- SO HE CALLS ME BACK LATER, HE SAYS, "SIR, I LOOKED INTO THE MATTER AND I HAVE ONE QUESTION. ARE YOU CERTAIN YOU GAVE US LAUNDRY?" AS SOON AS HE SAID THAT I WAS LIKE, "I DID NOT GIVE YOU -- WE HAVE A GREAT SHOW TONIGHT. THE CHAINSMOKERS ARE HERE. SO STICK AROUND AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ♪♪♪ >> SO THERE YOU HAVE IT. I WAS FIVE MILES AWAY FROM THAT BAR PLAYING POKER WITH HIS FRIEND, MR. BIRD, THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER. YEAH. THAT'S IT.

HE'S WAS ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT KILLING PEOPLE. >> COME ON, MAN! NO FURTHER QUESTIONS. >> OBJECTION. WHAT IS THIS WITH THE EYELASHES? I'M APPALLED BY THE PROSECUTION HERE. >> APPALLED OR JEALOUS? [ LAUGHTER ] >> APPALLED. THIS IS NOT FAIR. >> FINE. THE JURY WILL DO THEIR BEST TO NOT BE INFLUENCED BY THE PROSECUTION'S GORGEOUS, INVITING LASHES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEY WILL ALSO DISREGARD THE FACT THAT THE DEFENSE'S LASHES ARE CLUMPY AND UNREMARKABLE. [ LAUGHTER ] >> FINE, THANK YOU. MR. SHARP, WHEN YOU WERE QUESTIONED BY POLICE, YOU STATED THAT MR. BIRD JOINED YOU FOR POKER NIGHT AT YOUR APARTMENT. [ LAUGHTER ] IN FACT, HE CAME TO YOUR PLACE EARLY TO HELP YOU GET UP. YOU EVEN HAD LEFTOVER BEERS YOU BROUGHT THAT NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOW, I'M SORRY, BUT -- MY GOD! [ LAUGHTER ] OKAY, NOW HE IS DIRECTLY INFLUENCING THE JURY. >> THAT'S RIDICULOUS, YOUR HONOR. PERMISSION TO APPROACH THE BENCH? >> WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO VERY, VERY MUCH. [ LAUGHTER ] OH, BOTH OF YOU. >> I CAN GET YOU DISBARRED FOR THIS, MANIPULATING A JURY.

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >> WHAT'S UP, EVERYONE? WELCOME TO WEEKEND UPDATE. I'M MICHAEL CHE. >> AND I'M COLIN JOST. WELL IT TURNS OUT THE ONLY THING SCARIER THAN DONALD TRUMP ACTING UN-PRESIDENTIAL IS DONALD TRUMP ACTING PRESIDENTIAL. [ LAUGHTER ] IN RESPONSE TO THE SYRIAN REGIMES CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK, PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THURSDAY SPENT 59 TOMAHAWK MISSILES TO DISABLE A SYRIAN AIR FIELD. BECAUSE WHEN TRUMP IS ANGRY, HE ALWAYS PRESSES SEND. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS WHERE IT'S SEEMS EXTRA JARRING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT. EVEN IF YOU ARE A TRUMP SUPPORTER, IT'S GOTTA SEEM A LITTLE CRAZY THAT A GUY IS STARTING A WAR WITH ASSAD WHILE HE'S STILL BOGGED DOWN IN A TWITTER WAR WITH SCHWARZENEGGER. [ LAUGHTER ] REMEMBER AFTER TRUMP WAS ELECTED AND EVERYONE KEPT SAYING, "STOP TAKING TRUMP LITERALLY. HE'S NOT LITERALLY GOING TO BAN MUSLIMS AND DEPORT MEXICANS AND BOMB THE HELL OUT OF EVERYONE." AND ALL IM SAYING IS, IF I WERE HILLARY CLINTON, I'D START GETTING IN PRISON SHAPE. [ LAUGHTER ] >> I MAY BE OVERSIMPLIFYING THE DETAILS. >> THE U.S. HAS ATTACKED ASSAD WHO, LIKE US, IS ALREADY AT WAR WITH ISIS. BUT ASSAD IS A CLOSE ALLY WITH RUSSIA WHO TRUMP HAS SAID HE WANTS TO WORK WITH TO DEFEAT ISIS. EVEN THOUGH THE THREAT TO ISIS IS ASSAD WHO TRUMP JUST BOMBED. SO, IN CASE YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE FOLLOWING ALL THAT, HERE'S A REENACTMENT OF WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED. ♪♪♪ [ SLAPPING NOISES ] [ LAUGHTER ] SIMPLE ENOUGH, RIGHT? THE ATTACK COMES AS A SURPRISE BECAUSE JUST MONDAY, THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SYRIAN CONFLICT. AND BY THURSDAY HE HAD ALREADY ATTACKED THEM. HE'S HANDLING CONFLICT THE WAY MY MOTHER HANDLES FAMILY DRAMA. AT FIRST, SHE'S LIKE, "THIS AIN'T NONE OF MY BUSINESS. Y'ALL LEAVE ME OUT OF THIS." Y'ALL GROWN. THEN THREE DAYS LATER, SHE'S OUTSIDE MY EX'S JOB IN A TRACK SUIT WITH A BRICK IN ONE HAND AND HER WIG IN THE OTHER. [ LAUGHTER ] TRUMP ALSO BROKE PROTOCOL BY NOT WAITING FOR APPROVAL FROM CONGRESS. HE DIDN'T EVEN WAIT UNTIL HE WAS HOME. HE WAS STILL ON VACATION IN MARGARITAVILLE OR WHEREVER HE GOES. [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN SENT 60 MISSILES FROM AMAZON PRIME ON A WHIM. [ LAUGHTER ] >> PRESIDENT TRUMP MET WITH CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING -- THIS WEEK AT HIS MAR A LAGO ESTATE. AND THEN WHEN THE TWO MEN STOOD NEXT TO EACH OTHER FOR THE FIRST TIME, ONE THING BECAME VERY CLEAR. IF YOU MASH THEM TOGETHER, THEY WOULD LOOK EXACTLY LIKE STEVEN SEGAL. [ LAUGHTER ] >> ON FRIDAY THE SENATE VOTED TO CONFIRM SUPREME COURT NOMINEE NEAL GORSUCH WHICH MADE IT EXTRA AWKWARD FOR MERRICK GARLAND'S FAMILY WHEN HE PRETENDED TO COME HOME FROM WORK AGAIN. AFTER A LONG DAY AT THE SUPREME COURT. [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] >> THIS WEEK, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST STEVE BANNON WAS REMOVED FROM THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. AND THIS TIME, HE PROBABLY CAN BLAME THE JEWS. [ LAUGHTER ] [ AUDIENCE OOHS ] >> THE WHOUGS REVEALS THAT JARED KUSHNER TRAVELED WITH THE CHIEF OF STAFF. HE LOOKS LIKE COLIN WHEN HE GOES BUY WEED. >> IT WAS MY FIRST TIME. THIS WAS A COMPLETE LACK OF SELF AWARENESS. THEY ARE THE WORST THING THAT RICH WHITE GUYS CAN BE. OBLIVIOUS. HE IS ACCUSED OF BEING RACIST E. HE HAD TO REDUCE OVERSIGHT AND THE WAY TO PICK UP ON THE VIBE OF THE COUNTRY. FOUR DAYS INTO SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH, HE COMES TO DEFEND THE GUY ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. ON THE VERGE OF WORLD WAR 3, JARED KUSHNER ROLLS ON HIS BEST OUTFIT.
