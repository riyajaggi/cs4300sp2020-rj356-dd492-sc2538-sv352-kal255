You're the new guy. New guy gets shit. That's how it is. Yeah, especially when they find the new guy's Really shitty old commercial. Oh, yeah. Hey, I can laugh at myself just as well as the next guy, But the 500th time That a guy walks by your desk and says "arriba," okay? Kind of loses its comedic punch. Oh, you're too sensitive! You got to have a thick skin, rookie, Or those guys will eat you alive. Oh, this is work. Hang on. No, no, no. Phones -- really? Phones on the hike now? It's the regional rep. What do you want me to do -- not answer? Well, just take it in the car, 'cause I got a thing at 8:00. Well, go ahead. I'll catch up. Owen thoreau. Tee time? Oh, no, I wish. Got, uh, the weekly check-in With albert's guidance counselor. How's al doing? He's good. Doing real good. Yeah, he hasn't had that anxiety thing for a long time now. Although he's still kind of afraid to go out of the house. Supposed to be real good. 200 bucks a pop -- better be good. Well, win a couple tournaments on a senior tour, And you won't have to worry about money. yeah. No? Ah, I think I got ahead of myself On that senior-tour thing. What do you mean? Ahh. I don't have time. I got the divorce, the kids, the store... I get out there once in a while, But pros get out there. They got trainers and coaches and -- They're just good. Maybe you should sell the store. Yeah, yeah, that's what I'll do. I'll just sell the store right after lunch. Well, no, you got to kick yourself in the ass somehow. I mean, you got a small window to do this thing, And, personally, I think if you commit to it, You could do it. Do what? No. No, no. You can't take a phone call And then think we're gonna recap everything for you. You don't have to recap everything. Just catch me up. No. No, he's right. No cellphones on the hike. This is sacred time. Sacred time? What kind of bullshit is that? Tell me what you're talking about. Nope. Not gonna do it. You could've done it by now! Whoa, whoa. Leg cramp. Ahh. Fantasy woman. See, now, this just proves my point. What? You ever gonna ask her out, or are you just gonna sit on your ass? How is that a point? That's what I hate about you. You compare things that don't even make -- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shit, joe, if this is who she goes for, You might've had a chance. No, she ain't -- she ain't going for him. They're not boyfriend/girlfriend. Right? Look, they're just -- This is the worst day of my life. Snooze, you lose. Huh? Yeah. You say shit, you get hit. See? I can make rhymes that are mean, too. Academically, it's not ideal, But, you know, albert is albert. Yeah, mm-hmm. On a better note, I think it's a tremendous positive He's decided to go to the upper-school dance. I mean, usually -- mike, mike, hold one for one second. Sure. Yeah? We're out of "get well" balloons. I -- well -- All right, all right. Let me finish up here. Hey, mike, sorry. Oh, not a problem. I was just saying, when kids isolate themselves, It usually compounds their anxiety problems. Albert going to this dance is a really great thing. Yeah. You know, we really didn't push him on that or anything. No, I'm sure you didn't. You and sonia have been a great team. More often than not, divorce has the opposite effect. Anyway, I'm not here to judge. You get the picture. Yeah. Yeah, you're saying of all the screwed-up parents, we're the best. that's not how I meant that. By the way, how's the senior tour coming along? I think albert's told the whole school about it. He's very proud. Yeah, it's -- it's good. It's, uh... Can't wait to see you out there giving the old guys a run for their money. Yeah. Yeah, well, me too. Thanks. Um, all right, let me go, mike. All righty. All right, thanks. Yep. Bye. Bye-bye. I can't find anything. Yeah, it's all right. Let me -- I want to run something by you guys. Uh... I'm thinking maybe it's time that you guys take on Just a little more responsibility around here, you know? Like what? Like if we're low on something, you order it on your own. Or maybe you start opening and closing the store even more now. Is this, like, a promotion? Well... It's a responsibility promotion. So, does the responsibility promotion Come with, like, a pay promotion? Well... ...I'm thinking let's give this a try, And, uh, yeah, we'll see. So, probably more pay? We'll see. Okay, so, then who wants treat duty? Oh, sure, I'll do it. Is something wrong, jess? No, it's just aleece -- No, I know, you make those incredible cupcakes. And? Well, I mean, it is a lunchtime party, And I just -- is anybody else worried about all that sugar? I'll try and keep it on the healthy side. Great. And then, lauren, can I put you on party favors? Of course. You know what? I'm just gonna make you a list of stuff to get. Did you guys hear about that little boy in san diego Whose idiot father got him a science kit with magnets in it? He ate one, and then he had to have surgery. So, no magnet filling in the cupcakes, aleece. Jessica, I don't need a list. I know what toys are safe. Oh, no, I know. But I just... Oh, you know what? Why don't I be in charge of the favors? I do have a party-store connection, so... Oh, right. Lauren, you don't mind, do you? No. Ah, you're the best. All right, melissa, let me just finish this list. Okay. Service is out of control! Heads need to roll! "heads need to roll"? Hey, you say the word, I'll regulate. Okay, just relax. Hey, jesse. Quick question -- Um, what's the hold-up on the remote starter for carl's impala? Yeah, I'm sorry, boss. We're backed up. Listen, talk to your buyer, tell him I'm sorry. It might be another day. I talked to him when I sold him the car. I'm done talking to him. Especially when I know my car was here before that one! Go on. I'll take care of this. Unbelievable! New guy's got a temper. Yeah, well, nobody likes to get jerked around. I didn't jerk him around. Um, I got a work order here That says his car would be ready this morning. You signed it. Come on, he knows that a work order's a guess, Not a guarantee. The suits act like they don't so they can come down here Kicking and cussing, telling me how to run my shop, But nobody tells me how to run my shop. No, no, no, jesse, of course not. Let me ask you something that I've never understood about that whole deal. If you don't know when a car can get finished, Why not help us out and just say you don't know? Because if I say I don't know, Then your guys come down here and call me and my guys names. If I tell them "Thursday, " then they go away. Everybody's happy. Until Thursday. Yeah. It'll be Friday soon enough. Can you at least promise me that carl's car will be next? Yeah, no problem. Thank you. And, listen, this is the policy from now on -- It's okay to say "I don't know" If you really don't. But if you do know for sure, Just give the salesmen a date and time they can expect their car, And if they've got a problem with the date you give them, They can talk to me. All right, boss. Sure. Thank you. Stop your whining. Tell your buyer his car will be ready tonight. Ahh! Big o! Takin' care of "bidness"! Kickin' ass and takin' names! Say your wifand then, in -- bwhen you get back in... Mm. VoilÃ  -- the car remembers everything Exactly the way you like it, From the seat to the mirrors. What's that? What's what? That. That's, um, like a, um... My cousin has a t-shirt shop. He said we could make one 20 feet tall if we wanted. Can he do balloons? They use me as a -- excuse me just for a second. Should I tell them to lay off? No. It'll just get worse if they think I'm protecting him. What I'd like you to do Is deal with jesse down in service. oh, no, no, no, no. I'm not messing around there. Pain in the ass. So, what do I do -- fire him? Wouldn't do that. At least with jesse, you get good work. Remember when herman the german ran things? That son of a bitch almost cost us Our better business certification. Yep. The devil you know... Mr. T, you're still here. No. No, I'm not. No, I got a half-hour -- I'm gonna sneak in A little session before I got to pick up the kids. Well, this lady inside says she needs to talk to you. Dashaun, that's part of the whole "new responsibility" thing. You guys got to take care of that. Hey, joe. Okay, goody bags. Oh, water guns? No! Bubbles. Bubbles. Let me check the list to be safe. Nope, no bubbles. I never thought I could hate a list, but I do. I hate it. Ms. Jessica schultz does not take chances With her children's safety. If it says "made in china, " it's not on the list. Well, everything in here is made in china. What else for the safest, most boring party ever? Hey, how's the golf coming? Oh, it's good. It's going good. Call me. Mr. Sisler, I can only tell you What the service department tells me. This is the second time! Mr. Sisler -- I mean, it's ridiculous. Look, seriously, you can't keep doing this! If you just want to wait over there. We've got some coffee and -- Jesse! Jesse! Yeah, boss? Where's carl's car? It's right there. It's the impala, remember? You told me his car was up next. It is. My guys have been under these two all day. As soon as they're done, new guy's up. And when is that gonna be? Well, the malibu's an engine replacement, Cobalt's a tranny rebuild, So best I could tell you is... I don't know. I think that's you, boss. Owen thoreau. Hey, uh, what time is that dance tomorrow? I'm driving you guys, right? Oh, don't worry about me. Sudheer is picking me up. Yeah, and I'm not going. What do you mean? Said you were going. You told mr. Dokich you were going. Well, yeah. I just said that so he'd let me go to lunch. That guy never stops talking. Well, I got to tell you, albert, I kind of made plans thinking you were going. You should go, albert. It's fun. Yeah, like you're even going. After 10 minutes, you're going to jack fordham's party With all the other seniors. Parents gonna be there? Yes. Well, I don't get The whole changing-your-story thing, albert. You're not scared of getting shaky, right? 'cause you've been doing great with that. No, not really. Those things are just lame. Well, yeah, they start out lame, But then you start goofing off with wes and reed, And you're having fun. Next thing you know, the deejay's playing "crimson and clover." That's how all my dances ended, but still. Right? Uh-huh. Yeah. I'm not going. Hey, daddy. Why don't you have your uniforms on? I don't know. Melissa! Oh, my god, football. I'm sorry, I totally forgot. Boys, hurry up. Go to your room and get your football stuff. I'm sorry, my lunch went until 2:30-- I asked you to do one little thing. You know how jessica is with this party stuff. It's a lot to deal with. And then I was with joe for over an hour -- So, lunch, shopping, and party planning? That's your big day? Okay. Hey! Daddy, my cleats are stuck together. Cleats on in the car! Let's go! Let's go! This is classic. And, you know, the whole time, In my head, I'm telling myself, "just shut up and get out of the house!" But then my stupid ass just had to get one more shot in. Did she beat the shit out of you? 'cause she's small, but she's fast. She's like...Mnh! No, no. We didn't get a chance to talk about it. I came home, I put the boys to bed, and she was asleep. Then I had to leave early for that work shit. It's just... That's even worse now, 'cause it's building up. It's festering, trust me. It's festering. When your blood sugar gets low, you get cranky, right? So maybe it was that. I'm not gonna use my disease as an excuse. That's a mistake. You should be using that more to get out of stuff. I had a shitty day, okay? A particularly shitty day. And, yes, I know it's wrong, But I brought it home and I took it out on her, And tonight I will apologize, okay? Okay, if she doesn't understand that, then -- Then I don't know what. You scared? Little bit. That's just hilarious. Hilarious, guys! It's delicious, terry. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Oh, yeah? Why not? Because they've got 15 more in the closet, And you getting upset is exactly what they want. What am I supposed to do? Just take their crap? The only thing those guys respect Is selling cars and getting laid. And since I'm not in the getting-people-laid business... Who's rod sherwood? He's senior's old agent. He buys a new corvette every two years, And he always pays sticker price. I gave him your name. Why? Because junior's got enough to worry about Besides waiting for you and the rest of the girls To stop giving each other titty twisters. Sherwood's coming in at 5:30. Don't screw it up. Jesse, come on in. Shut the door. There a problem, boss? Well, yeah, jesse. There is. There's a lot of problems, actually, But, um, for starters, I don't see why We can't figure out some way to get sales and service on the same team. Probably 'cause the guys in sales are assholes. Um, look, um, I think I made a mistake yesterday Trying to tell you how to run your shop, And I apologize. But you got to see things from my side. I've got a customer that's unhappy. I got to act on that. Well, customers only get unhappy When people promise them things they can't deliver. Newbie wanted to play the big man And show his customer he could push that car through. Now he looks bad, thoreau looks bad, And, for some reason, I'm the one up here Getting talked to in your daddy's office. Right. And he's not the worst one. I mean, every day, one of those suits comes down And tries to squeeze my guys for some "rush job." If I don't stand up for them, nobody does. Uh, why don't I give you a few more guys, Lighten the load so things don't back up? No. Our shop has one of the shortest turnaround times in the region. You bring in new hires, the next thing you know, The work dries up, and then my guys are eyeballing me 'cause I got to cut them to half a day. I don't think so. Okay, um... I guess I need to, uh, Do some...More thinking on this. Yeah, okay. Oh. But, hey, listen... Don't beat yourself up. I mean, when daddy just up and hands you The keys to a new car like this, You're bound to scratch a quarter panel or two, right? Have a good one. Brbruce did talk to me, I was comingand -- I'm running a little late. Well, that's not a problem. But you've got the corvettefor? I'm looking at her right now, And she is definitely cherry. Okay. Be there by 8:00. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. Hey, terr, we're grabbing sombeers. You in? Uh, sorry, fellas. Got plans. How about you? Mm, gee, I was gonna get my burro detailed. Vamanos, chicos. Las cervezas están esperando. Keep laughing, dicks. Maybe I should just go hit a bucket of balls with you. All right, albert, come on. What's the matter? You feeling shaky right now? No. Look, the driving range -- it's 2 miles away. You feel something coming on, you call me up, I come right back here. 10:30, right? 10:30. 10:30, I'm right here. Look, how about this? How about I'll text you every hour, Just, you know, make sure you're doing okay? Yeah, okay. Yeah. That sounds good. Yeah, every hour. 10:30. On the dot. Hi, honey. Hey. Uh, melissa? Um, yesterday was a particularly hard day for me. And, uh, that being said, It doesn't give me the right to treat you the way that I did. Um, what I said to you -- That was wrong of me. Thank you, sweetie. But you weren't wrong. What? Yes, at first, I was really, really pissed at you. And then I started to think about it, And I realized it wasn't you I was mad at. I was mad that you were right. My -- my blood sugar might have also been a little low. Owen... I want to go back to work. Now, I know I've always said That it wasn't worth it financially, But I think -- I think that was just my fear talking. I was using that as an excuse Because I was scared that if I went back to work, I wouldn't be a good mother. Now I know I'm a good mother. You're a great mother. Well, remember, I was gonna go back to work When the boys started school, But then terry had that stupid mojito party, And then nine months later we had hana -- who we love, But now we both know we're done with kids. So it's time. Um, it's -- it's not that I don't want you to, But I'm not sure that it is time. Debbie cooke has been after me for I don't know how long to get together with her, So I figured it might be worthwhile To see what she has to offer. Do you know that she is senior editor of that magazine now? I mean, I trained her. You know that things are crazy at the store right now, right? And I can't promise how much I'm gonna be around -- Weekends or -- Honey, I need to do this. Look, I don't want to be the mom That fills her day worrying about the kids eating magnets. I mean, do you get that? Sure, yeah. I guess, um, the next time debbie calls, Um, we'll see. Well, we're having lunch tomorrow. Tomorrow? So, this is just happening? Well, honey... Obviously, you've made up your mind. I don't even know why you bother talking to me. Because this is what we do. It's just not a good time. Owen... Well, mom, you were right. But now our dinners are a little too exciting. Indicate more, you idiot. Okay, I'm heading out. Oh, alexis, I thought you already left. See you tomorrow. Good night. Don't work too hard. Yeah, don't worry. I won't. Arigato-o-o! You forget some-- Terry? Good. Let's go again. Hmm. Good. Very good -- now, let's just be a little smoother Through the transition, all right? Attention, lacorte's customers. The coffee bar will be closing in 10 minutes. Just a medium coke, please. Sorry. We just have coffee. Oh. Um, okay. Give me a triple espresso. At a quarter to 9:00? Wow. You're like a real italian or something. Yeah, uh, I am. My name's tranelli. Really? Tranelli what? Uh...Spaghetti. Tranelli spaghetti. Hello? Hey, dickless. Where are you? I'm, uh -- I'm at the bookstore. Why? He's at the bookstore. Dude, why are you at the bookstore? Books are lame. Okay, listen, brian pollard just got into the senior party 'cause his brother's there. So? So your sister's there, right? You got to get us in there. We close in 10, mr. Spaghetti. You know, I must've driven by this place Every day on my way to school. How weird is that? A teacher. I mean, wow, that's -- 11th- and 12th-grade history. Of course, a little drama. So, I make the mistake of mentioning That, you know, a long time ago, I had been in some commercials, So next thing I know, One of my students pulls out his phone. We're watching you and I. Then we start reading the comments. I said to myself, "I got to look that poor bastard up." How long ago did we make those spots? Oh, please, don't make me say it. You know, the only thing I really can remember about that shoot Was that the first thing you said to me Was that you had this strict policy against dating actors. That is not the first thing I said. Yes! Yes, it was. I don't believe that that is the first -- And I hadn't even thought about asking you out. Ohh. I mean, I'm sure I would have eventually, But, I mean, it was -- whoa! Geez! Ah. Thank you. Excuse me, I have to get that. Of course. Thoreau chevrolet. Is this terry? Yes, sir. Mr. Sherwood? Yes. Listen, terry, I'm really jammed up at the office here. Oh, well, that's okay.
