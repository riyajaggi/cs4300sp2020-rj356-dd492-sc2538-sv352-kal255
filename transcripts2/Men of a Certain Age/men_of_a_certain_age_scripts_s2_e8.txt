 Well, that should tell you something. If a woman did that, it means she's not interested. My wife said no to me a few times. Now we're married with two kids and a bunch of cats. Well, this dealership -- this is my family. And we're all pretty happy here. But we do have a bunch of strays back by service. Help yourself to those. Come on, man. Let's be real here. Can we be real? By all means, be real. I can come up a little on the number. There ain't nowhere to go but up from bullshit. Come on, big "O." Do I have to go above your head? Look... My daddy still owns this place, but he turned it over to me. I'm running it now. And while I appreciate your offer, I'm, um -- I'm pretty dug in here. Gonna take the place to -- to the next level. You just watch. Well, I look forward to the competition -- any competition. It's been a while. Oh, by the way, your inventory is looking pretty static. You might want to switch some of these up. Maybe move the ZR1 into the showroom. Give the customers some eye candy. You know, you're right. I'll start by asking you to move your car off my lot. All right. I guess I'll have to settle for owning you on the softball field. - All in good fun, right? - Yep. Ah! Mr. Brand... You let me know when you want to come work at a real dealership. Yeah, I hope we can still be friends! Sweet 'Vette. Don't you watch him drive away. I got everything you need right here. Watch me walk away.

Pick up if you're there. Sorry if I'm interrupting anything between you and Erin. Wow-chicka-wow-wow! Anyway, your shift started an hour ago. Boss man wanted me to make sure you're okay.

Hey. How'd the golf go? Any holes-in-one? Dashaun, you know, you ask me that every time. I mean, you understand a hole-in-one, it's like a once-in-a-lifetime thing, right? I mean, some people, they go their whole lives, they never get a hole-in-one. Guess you didn't get one, then. Hey, Maria, um -- Hold on. Hey. Hi. Hi. Whoa, whoa, is that Albert? Yep. He and the band have been at it since 8:00 a.m. He's really excited for their show, which is why I'm calling. We need your truck. Five boys and all those instruments? Um, yeah, okay. So, like, 3:00, right? Well, Albert wants to get to the school early to set up, so it would be more like 2:00. 2:00? Oh, God. I want to get to the range first. What?! No, nothing. Okay. All right. 2:00, sure. All right, thanks, Joe. Okay. See ya. Oh, Maria, you confirmed the menu for that party, right? And the permits for the trucks, you got those, right? No, no, not yet. What? It's inventory day. I know, but I shouldn't have to check up on that stuff. Excuse me, Mr. Joe. Saturday, I supposed to work morning, but dentist only morning. So, maybe I -- You know, Carlos, I'm sure it's okay, all right? Right now I'm in the middle of stuff. And you know Maria does the schedule. So you got to check with her first, okay? Maria, Saturday, I supposed to work morning -- just give us a second, Carlos. Give us one second. I sorry. I wait. All right, look, if you don't have time for something, you got to delegate, okay? How come Dashaun's not doing inventory? 'Cause he's doing the window. I know, but, I mean, you just -- you got to manage people. That's what a manager does -- they manage. Okay. Geez. All right, I'm sorry. I'll call the caterer, okay? Is good time? Yeah. What do you need? Saturday, I supposed to work morning, but dentist... Mr. Provenzano, you are gonna write me a letter thanking me for selling you such a beautiful car. I will be right out with your keys. Thank you so much. How does Marcus have two sales already today? Came in on time, maybe? Lexi, darlin', mark me. You believe that shit, Hollywood? A letter. Nobody writes letters anymore. You know what? You're right. Maybe they'll send an e-mail. You do know what the Internet is, right? That place where you reorder your Viagra? Change that number, darlin'. Don't worry, I'll leave your name on top. Dude... She wants you. Always when you have a girlfriend, right? Story of my life. When it rains it pours. Hey, folks. Hey. Terry Elliot. Peter Lewis. Hey, how are you? Is, uh, Marcus here? He showed us an Equinox last week, and, uh, we're ready to take the plunge. Oh. No, Marcus just... stepped away for a minute, but if you want to wait in... You know what? I have no idea when Marcus is gonna be back. You want to take a seat at my desk and we can get the, uh, paperwork started? Okay. Well, hello. I'll take two samoas, the thin mints, and mommy's phone number. Nice... I appreciate you checking in, Joe. Yeah, no problem. You want me to take that up to the kitchen for you or something? No, I got everything I need right here. This thing will blend anything. Shut up or you're going in there. So, uh, how ya feelin'? Good? Eh, thought I was over the nausea hurdle -- it came back with a vengeance. I was up half the night. Starting to get this dry-mouth thing, too. If I stand up too quick, I get, like... Hey, you listening, Joe? I was just getting to the part about my diarrhea. No, I'm listening. I'm just -- I don't know. That "Senior Tour" thing -- I was all over the place today. So you had a bad day. A lot of bad days. All right, you suck, then. What do you want me to say? Aren't you the one that's supposed to be cheering me up? Yeah. Ugh. Here, boy. Taste buds are messed up, too. Hey, uh, the stripper, huh? She went with you to chemo. Tell me more, man. That's all you need to know, horny Joe. Oh, come on, man. She's a good person. Nothing happened. Not yet anyway. Maybe down the road -- who knows, you know? I got to stop now because if I get a hard-on, I'm gonna faint. All right. Well, keep me posted on that. Listen, I gotta get going. Albert's band is doing this thing at school. It's a big deal for him, actually, so, uh... Oh, that's the kid that freaks out, right? Relax, Joe. I didn't mean "freaks out." I'm just trying to be nice here. Yeah. Yeah, okay. You know, you're the reason he's weird. You know that, right? Yeah. Sorry, um, is there much more? 'Cause we promised our son we'd take him to the Tar Pits. Almost home, Pete. Almost home. One last thing. This navigation... Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, Peter. How are you? Hey. Good to see you again. Hey, Jennifer, how are you? Do you folks mind if I borrow Terry for a sec? No, go ahead. Thanks. Excuse me. You know, you folks are gonna write me a letter thanking me for selling you such a beautiful car. What's up? What the hell you think you're doing? What? You trying to skate me? Customer walks in, wants to buy a car. It's an open floor. No. No, that doesn't apply to customers I've already qualified. Don't worry. You'll get the next one. If you even let them get to me. Are you still bitching 'cause I got the desk by the door? How can you even bitch when you got the biggest advantage of everybody? Oh, please. You think I've got it easier because I'm friends with Owen? How'd you even get this job, actor boy? Your only qualifications are waiting tables and wearing wigs. And yet I'm tied with you for sales. That's what's really pissing you off, isn't it? No, no, what's really pissing me off is you're trying -- You know, we're kind of in a bit of a hurry. Can you help us? You want to talk about this upstairs? Yeah, let's talk about it upstairs. Actually...No. Let's go settle it. We can go up into Owen's office right now. Oh, oh, now you want to go up to Owen's office? We don't have to go to the office. Let's go. He wasn't even around! That's a lie, man! That's a stone-cold lie! It is not a lie! How are you gonna let your boy sit in your office and lie, Owen?! All right, all right, calm down. What's the story? Was he around? I didn't see him. I didn't. I'm gonna split this down the middle. What?! No, no, you can't -- and we'll figure out a new rotation for the desks. No! Everybody happy? No, man! Not at all! Then I've done my job. Come on, guys. This stuff is petty. You're both All-Stars. You're Jordan and, um... ...and you're both good. You know. But, uh, teamwork. We done? Yeah, we're done. You're Pippen. Yeah, you're Jordan, but when he played for the Wizards. You're Jordan when he played for the White Sox. Oh, damn it. What's that about? "What's that about?" Is we're getting freakin' old. I can't sit on my wallet anymore. I got all this ass-bone trouble. Ass-bone trouble? Yeah. Yeah. That'd be the worst name for a blues singer, wouldn't it? No, you know, I can't -- it, like, slants me. The hip or the joint gets all out of whack. I read about it, too. It's not good. You told me about it, right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Why? You don't get that? You can just squat on your wallet like that, no problem? No problem, dude. Yeah, that's 'cause you got like a built-in couch down there. No, no, I got a man's ass is what I got. You? You got an ass like Olive Oyl. Here you go, gentlemen. Yes. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Oh, see that? That's what I should have got. Should've got the salad. That's good, right? Yeah, good. Hey, so, what are you doing for your birthday? You're the first one, man. Big 5-0. You still gonna hike Mount Whitney like you said? Or have you figured out something to do that people would actually like? Yeah, no Mount Whitney, guys. Oh, really, no? Well, are you gonna do anything? Big 5-0. I know, but it's just a number. It's no big deal. Ah, him and his lover, Marcus, were at it today. Let it go, dude. Really? Just let it go? The guy's using the fact that someone's finally challenging him as an excuse to act like a total dick, and that's okay? It sounded like you did skate him a little. Okay, but am I wrong about the guy, though? All the frat-boy insults -- he's a dick. Used to hear you complain about him all the time. Yeah, but you can't take away a guy's sale because he's a dick. Otherwise, um... you'd still have zero. See, he's saying that you're also a dick. Uh-huh. Which is not a great joke. It certainly doesn't deserve that laugh. No. Yeah, Marcus wasn't totally wrong about you. You have been coming in late a lot... and without a tie. You need me to show you how to...do the knot again? That's funny. I am funny. Come on, man! I'm like George Carlin today! George Carlin? That's the comedian that you're most like? What? He's funny. I'm funny. I haven't been late a lot, okay? Maybe the past few days, but not a lot. Okay. I mean, as far as the tie goes, nobody's ever not bought a car from me because of a tie. Okay, easy, man. No tie today. Lighten up, dude. Yeah, what's up, man? Screw it. I'll just go home and get a tie. Oh, well, actually, um, I need you to go pick up an A/C compressor from the Distro in Torrance. You want me to do a parts run? Don't you think I'd be of better service to you selling cars? Yeah, well, the parts department is shorthanded. I'm just going by seniority. Just 'cause you're old doesn't mean you have seniority. Oh, come on, man! What are you doing, huh? He's trying to be like George Carlin, that's all. Come on back! See, his ass is right in between yours and mine. Yeah, he's got a good ass. Hey. Hi. Glad you're here. Albert was getting nervous about being late. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, the truck's outside. Albert! Dad's here! Okay, coming! Man! Should we do something? I mean, should we stop him or something? Stop him? No, he's excited! Okay, but, you know, there's already a lot of built-in pressure with these things already. What if they laugh or yell at him? This could set him back with his anxiety. Joe, it's high school. No one's gonna be good. Heidi Pines' kid is doing a monologue from "Nightmare on Elm Street." All right, you know what? His voice is changing. Look, Albert's doing great, Joe. Dr. Schneider thinks that his band friends are making a difference. He could lose them if we stop him. Yeah, well, what if he gets shaky and he can't even go on stage? He could lose them that way, too, right? Albert! Hi, dad. What's up, guys? Uh, dad, this is Ben. We call him "Doc" 'cause his dad's a dentist. Hey, that's cool. Hey, Doc. Yeah. All right, you know what? The truck's outside, boys, so load it up. Hey, dad, you're gonna love the song we picked. I got it from your iPod. Cool. I'll see you later. Okay. What song is it? I've heard it 100 times -- no idea. Hmm. Excuse me. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. They made me park near the football field. He's up next, I think. Okay. Young man: Lame! Your girlfriend's goth, Delaney! Boo! Is it too late to stop him? All right, folks. That was something, wasn't it? How about another round for Dutch oven? Yeah. Keep it going, everybody, for our next act -- dog's best friend! - Whoo! - Yeah! Whoo! Uh-oh. Oh, God. Where is he? I don't know. Young man: Boring! Oh, God. All right, come on. Oh, dear. Oh, yes. Whew! Yeah, just don't say anything. Ohh. Hey, Hollywood's back from his parts run. Hey, once you put that down, I'm gonna need you to pick me up some Chick-fil-A. Oh, and gum. Hot out there, huh? Number one, baby. Stings, don't it? ♪ Will it go 'round in circles? ♪ ♪ will it fly high like a bird up in the sky? ♪ Okay, okay. ♪ Will it go 'round in circles? ♪ ♪ will it fly high like a bird up in the sky? ♪ - Uh, what's he doing? - Oh, my. Are you kidding me? Oh, no. Oh, my... Whoo, Albert! ♪ Will it go 'round in circles? ♪ Whoo-hoo! Whoo! All right, Albert! All right, easy, now. Look at him. He's working the room. Do you believe how far this kid's come? Honestly? No. It's like he's not afraid of anything anymore. I know. Is high-fiving -- we're too old for that, right? Oh, there he is! Yeah, the rock stars! There they are! You guys were great! Good job. I'm so proud of you! Yeah, I know some parts sucked, but some parts were really good. Yeah, like when you took off your shirt. Well, that's the first time we got through the whole song without stopping. Yeah, we did good. Let's pack up, guys. Hey, congratulations. Good job, guys, yeah. Doc! Huh? No, no. Good -- good stuff. Oh. You were good, yeah. Good stuff. Oh. Albert, you looked like you were having so much fun up there. I know. I almost didn't do it. I thought about not going up there. But you know what? That's okay, 'cause you kicked your anxiety in the balls today. Mind's eye, dad. Mind's eye! That's this golf thing I taught him. I guess he's applying it to life, music, everything. Okay, good job. Is anybody planning on selling any cars today? I was doing my dad. Hey, look, man, you had a shitty day. Why don't you go home? Get some dinner, get some sleep. Come back tomorrow -- it'll be less shitty. Yeah. Another Boston cream. Two pieces of pie? You putting on weight for a part? 'Cause I thought you quit acting. That's a joke. How late you working tonight? Uh...another hour? Hmm. What, I'm not worth the wait? Look at me. Huh? I am a sucker for a girl in a short apron. Hmm. Good. Isn't that caffeine gonna keep you awake all night? No, but I'm hoping you will, though. Oh. Happy Birthday! Happy Birthday! Wow. Wow, everyone. He's with her now? Where's Erin? I don't know. I left her a message. Happy Birthday, sweetie. Thanks. And you must be Erin. I've heard so much about you. It's Laura, actually. Oh, okay. Laura. I thought you said -- Champagne for the birthday boy! Thanks, guys. Although, technically, it's not my birthday till tomorrow. Hence the surprise. I was worried you'd beat me here. You know, but for once, your being late all the time paid off. You know, technically, you're not middle-aged anymore. You're 5/8 aged. Are you telling me I'm gonna know this dick for 30 more years? Ah! Hey, man. Hey. Where's Erin? I'm gonna... Go use the restroom. So, uh, nice party, huh? Mm. You didn't think we were just gonna let you get a camera up your butt for your 50th, did you? Yeah, the whole parts run -- I think I get it. Yeah, I couldn't let you go home and get a tie. You know? We were setting up. Yeah, that vinyl banner? - That's all me. - You got me. We didn't even need the compressor. Maybe tomorrow I'll have Marcus take it back to Torrance, huh? I'm just gonna refill, okay? Ooh, he drank that fast. Hey, is that strudel? I'm a bit of a foodie. I'm Lawrence, by the way. Hi. Hey, Steve. Hey, dog! "Terr-ing" it up tonight, huh? Got you a little present. A little parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. Uh, yeah, thanks, Steve, but I'm not doing that stuff so much a-anymore. Actually, not at all. What? It's your 50th, though, man. This is like a special occasion and shit, bro. Yeah, I, uh... Look, it's been 20 weeks, doing good, so, you know... Come on. I got it for you. Uh... Yeah, okay, thanks. Thanks. And that's the good stuff, man. So you better give your speech first. Oh, no, I'm not giving any speeches. You will if I say... Speech! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. Speech! Steve, Steve, come on, stop it. Speech! Speech. Yeah, dude! Speech! Stop. No, come on, guys. Come on, guys. I'm not -- I'm not giving a speech! Uh, sorry, sorry. You know what? Let me just hit the head first, okay? Excuse me. That was weird. So, what was that about? You better not be an asshole at your party. No, no, no. No party for me. The day after I turn 50, I'm qualifying for the Senior Tour, baby. All right, Joe. You go. Yeah, I'm gonna go, yeah. Yeah. Let me, uh, get this. Hey. What's up? I'm...kind of in the middle of something. Sorry, Joe, I'm not feeling too good. I was wondering if you could run an errand for me tomorrow. Uh...sort of got a full day tomorrow. I was gonna hit the course for a few hours. I'm kind of pumped, actually. Hey, that's great, Joe. Good for you. But this won't take that long, though. Remember the guy at the restaurant I made the pickup from last week? He owes me $500. Can you pick it up for me? Oh Yeah, I don't know. Joe, he's harmless. Come on, you saw him. Yeah. It's not that. Joe, you're not gambling. You're picking up an envelope, all right? You've gone to the mailbox before, haven't you? Come on, I'm throwing up every two seconds.

I wish the day would come when that man would grow up. Did he even thank you and Joe for throwing his party? I mean, he was rude. Look, he's been an ass lately, but it's Terry. Nothing lasts too long. I guess this whole "turning 50" thing hit him harder than we thought it would. Shoot. He still thinks he's 20, like that caterer. A guy like him denies aging so much that when it finally happens, he can't handle it. As opposed to a guy like Joe. Did you hear him going on about trying out for the Senior Tour? Now, he is not feeling sorry for himself. He's out there pursuing his dream. Yeah, he's doing really good. Yeah. You're not gonna be pulling that "turning 50" freak-out shit on me, are you, big man? No. No. Because I'm like the perfect combination. I got the maturity of an old guy...

But I'm from Highland Park, so...can't bet against your home team, right? Yeah. So you got me down for $100? Okay, yeah, I'll tell him. Thanks. All right. Okay. We're gonna need all hands on deck today. The dealer rep's coming to check inventory, and we have a new shipment of Malibus arriving. We haven't even sold the old ones. Also, Jesse's got a new form for all service orders. Let's just, uh... So, uh, let's just keep the peace and...help Jesse out by actually using the new forms. Hey, you got the name of the catering company from last night? I'm pretty sure that Stella chick dug me. ...We're gonna use the dealer invoice number. That's our number, not the VIN number on the car, okay? And then you'll notice farther... Manfro? Hey, Manfro. Oh. Sorry. Must have drifted off. Last night, I fell asleep on the can. Anyway, here you go. Oh. Thanks. So, uh, how's today been? Tired. Couldn't even finish the stupid puzzle. Frickin' oceans. 10 bucks of this is going to the Cancer Society. Gotta light a fire under those guys. Yeah. $10 -- that ought to do it. Oh, hey, the guy, Bill, says he's been trying to call you. He wants to get something in tonight. Nah. No? You don't want the bet? Nah. No bets today. Got the ringer off. Get the drapes, would you, Joe? Uh, he said he wants Chicago, though. I mean, that's easy money, right? I know you got your heart set on red. This one's got the ebony interior, which I love. It's the hottest-selling combination. What the hell? Come on! Sorry, man. Thought I could catch a few at lunch, you know? In one of our cars? Sorry. Whoa. Let me get you gentlemen some coffee. Um, I'll be with -- with you in a second. Tell Hollywood I don't want him with the customers today. He can move inventory. I need the ZR1 in here. Okay. Hey, boss says you're off sales. Gotta move the ZR1 in here. What? Why? Uh... Oh, come on, man. Hey, I think you look great. Looks like a hospital bed closed right up on you. You drive safe, now. Hey, Bill. What's up? Hey. The money was right, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no. I just wanted to tell you that I talked to Manfro, and... He took your bet. He, uh, he took the bet. Oh. Okay. You didn't have to come back and -- did the spread change? No, no. No, it's still even. Yeah, I was just driving by. I just thought you might want to know. Okay. I know. Okay, see you later. Yeah. So it's $100 on Chicago, even spread. Yeah. I know. Okay, see you later. Are you folks looking at 36 months, 48 months, or 60 months? 60? We can get you down nice and low for 60 months. Fill those out, then we'll take it for a test drive. We'll run your credit while we're out. You'll be back. You'll be on -- whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Are you all right? You all right? Sorry. This thing's just got so much pickup, you know? Huh? You're a joke, Terry! You hear me! You're a joke, old man! Whoa! Whoa! What happened here?! What happened?! What happened is I told you to do something about your boy, and you didn't, Owen! Wait, wait, calm down a second, man! No, no, it's too late for that! I'm done with you! And I'm done working at this shit box! Get me some paper towels or some rags or something. Well... I don't think he broke it. Oh, good. Look, uh... I know I haven't actually... been myself lately, you know? The party and here, and, you know, because it's -- stupid birthday. I mean, what does it matter? You know? Erin broke up with me. I know what you're gonna say -- that I only, you know... dated her a couple of months and it shouldn't be affecting me... ...This much. And maybe it shouldn't. But it is, and I don't know why. Christ, I'm gonna sound like some damn teenager, you know? But I thought -- I thought it was something different, you know? I thought I -- I thought I was something different. And, you know, lately I-I've been wondering if I even, you know... belong here anyway, right? I mean... Marcus and Lawrence -- I'm not like those guys. And now... ...now even you're sick of me, and... I, uh... You got every right to fire me, and, you know, I don't want to make you do that. So... Why don't I just do the right thing, huh? And I-I-I quit. Uh, you're not quitting. Do you think you're the only one here with problems? Other shit to worry about? We all got problems, and you just created a damn big one for me. I have the opportunity here to actually do something with this place, to bring it back from the dead, and you just chased my best salesman out the door -- along with 25 sales. So you're not going anywhere. You dug this big-ass hole... And you're gonna fill it up. Go clean yourself up and be back in here... At 7:00... With a tie. And, um... ...Grow up. Dude, you bleed a lot. And with two clicks on the clock, Chicago's down by two. Lobs in to Armstrong. He turns... 3-pointer... Off the back of the rim! That's the ball game! Miami hangs on to beat Chicago! I just won 100 bucks. Whoo! == sync, corrected by elderman ==
