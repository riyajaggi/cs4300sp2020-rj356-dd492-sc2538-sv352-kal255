 You can't stop watching it either, huh? Uh, no, no. It's just...this would have been better if I'd had more time, that's all. Oh, own the brilliance, dude. Since those commercials hit the air, this place has been humming. You want to drive to lunch or should I? Unless that's your up. Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's my up. Lawrence, why don't you take it? Really? The month ends tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Don't hurt yourself. You're getting cocky. Eh, the universe will give me what it wants to give me. I thought you were off the pot. Can you believe this stupid machine? Ate up the whole security tape. I don't know. Yeah. I'm telling you, my old man's driving me crazy -- just sits there in the corner like a stuffed bear. His head doesn't move, but I can feel his eyes following me everywhere I go. You got to cut the guy some slack. These old dudes -- they don't retire well. Just not good with free time. Aah, damn it. You okay? Yeah. Whoo. My tooth is sensitive. Every time I drink cold water, it just -- it shocks a nerve. Oh, man, it hurts like crazy. So, why are you drinking cold water? I know, right? Why? It's like -- you know what it is? It's the pimple that it hurts every time you touch it. You still got to do it. No, but damn it, it hurts. How crazy is fate, huh? Homeless guy knocks your tooth out, and you get to see Dori again. Wait. Dori. Uh, blind-date Dori? Yeah. Yeah, thanks for bringing me to her. I'm sure she got real turned on watching me drool all over myself. Hey, you never know. She is a dental hygienist. Yeah. You should call her. No, I'm not gonna call her. Happy Birthday. Uh-huh. And I'll take that whenever. Thank you. What's with the muffin? Yeah, uh -- Yeah, is today your... Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. ...Birthday, birthday? Had to do it, right? I tell you not to do it, and now look at this. I got a three-month-old muffin that's gonna make me crap all day. All right, here's to hitting the ground running. Turn 50 today, play your first pro tournament tomorrow, huh? How many times I got to tell you? It's not a pro tournament. It's the prequalifier -- I told you that -- to get into the tournament. There's 100 guys playing for 5 spots. Okay. Yeah, yeah. You suck. We know. Yeah, I mean, you almost pussed out, but you didn't. You're gonna take that great what-if that's been itching you, and you are gonna scratch the hell out of it. Really, I'm good. I'm good. I don't need or want a pep talk. Fine. I can't be there, anyway. But I'll be rooting for you... In my mind. Why you got to make it sexual? It's your birthday. Yeah. I'll be there, cheering loud enough for the both of us. Really? Your boss know? If he keeps selling cars the way he has been, he can take the whole month off. Huh. Oh, cool. Yeah. Mm. Oh, here we go. Here we go. Nope. Hold on. Don't punch the muffin. Got a fully enclosed trunk. Wow. This is a really nice car. Yeah. I-I don't think I can pull the trigger on this right now. Yeah, well, decisions are hard. I mean, you know, look. You look at those birds. Think they worry like we do? No. When one bird wants to fly away, he just goes. He doesn't check in with any other birds. Yeah, he's got wings. He can -- he can just go. That's right. Yeah! Whoo! Surprise! Surprise! Happy Birthday. Oh, come on, guys. I tell you, you don't have to get me anything. Here. Oh. All right. What could this be? Golf balls! Oh, I wish I played. Look inside, goof. Oh, you painted them, like you used to. Oh. Thanks, Lucy. It's great. Here. What'd you make me, lunch? Is this my dad's? Yeah. Uh, last time we were at grandpa's, I saw his old clubs in the garage, and -- I don't know -- I thought it'd make a good good-luck charm. So you stole it. Thanks. Albert, this is great. Plus, I can always sneak it back after we play tomorrow -- I mean, after we win tomorrow. Okay, all right. Just don't get your hopes up. No. You're gonna win. Yeah, you got to. We don't want a loser for a dad. Okay. Happy Birthday, Dad. All right. Yeah, good night. Oh, shit. Thanks, Kelly. I really appreciate the extra 30 days. Okay, bye. Hey, O, you got a second? Yeah. What's up? Well, it's just, you know, we, uh, made those commercials, and, you know, I think, uh -- well, I think they came out pretty good. Um, I mean, it could have been better. Better how? I mean, that goofy shit with Lawrence has brought in more traffic than any spot senior's done in the last five years. But don't say that in front of him. No. Wow. I'm glad that you think that. It makes this easier. Um...I'm quitting. Again? Well, no, O, I'm serious. Making those commercials, I-I really -- I felt like myself again. You know, I'm not really built for selling cars. You're tied for first in sales this month. I know. Actually, I just sold a Corvette. Look, I don't want to be the shrink here, but this is the same shit you've been doing since the day I met you. You've got a good thing going on here. You're looked up to, making a good buck. You're getting comfortable. But because you've been uncomfortable for so long, that actually feels wrong to you. So you're, um, searching for something new. That was true in the past, but this is different. Working here has shown me how much I can do when I apply myself, and I really appreciate you giving me that chance. So do the artsy-fartsy shit on the side and keep selling cars. I need you here. No, you don't. That's the thing. I mean -- I mean, look at Lawrence. The guy's on fire. Carl's kicking ass. Everybody out there, they're kicking ass. The stuff that you're doing -- that you are doing -- a month from now, you won't even miss me. You see how good you are? What? I'm even falling for this shit. Look, it's just I know myself, right? And if I hang around, I'll just put all that stuff second. O...Kay. Um, I-I knew this day was coming, but I hoped it'd be 10 Corvettes from now. I'm not gonna lie to you. It sucks you're leaving. But, um, Terry, you sold a hell of a lot of cars. You did your part, saving our asses with those commercials. So, what does -- what does Erin think about all this? I'll let you know. See what I mean? Uncomfortable. Dad, you know what's cool? You just turned 50. You're like the youngest guy here. It's like an advantage. Yeah, I guess. Okay, I'm going! I promise these boxes will be gone when you get home from work. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Two minutes. Two minutes, and you will have the best coffee of your life. I'm kind of late. No, you won't regret it, I promise. Hey, is it casual Monday at work today? No, I'm not going in. I'm gonna go watch old men play golf, remember? Oh, that's right. God, I wish I worked for my best friend. Yeah, you know, about that -- I wanted to talk to you. I'm pretty much done there. Kind of, uh...I kind of quit. Okay, I'm -- I'm confused. When -- when -- when did you make this -- Yesterday. You know how people have been going bonkers over the commercial, right? Uh, okay. Right? And I got to tell you, it's been pretty exciting, and it's made me want to do something creative again. This about acting? No, no, actually. Directing. Wow. Yeah, and Naomi -- you know, the director that I was telling you about -- um, she's shooting this big, huge cellphone commercial, uh, next week. And she said that, you know, if I wanted to, you know, I could come on the set and, um, you know, pick her brain, and... I-I know I'm kind of dropping this on you right now. I've got a class in like -- in like 20 minutes. Okay, right, and so, you know, we'll just -- we'll talk about it later, okay? Okay, you know what? Except after work, I got to go drop off my keys at my apartment -- my old apartment. Okay, okay. So -- so -- so after that, okay? I guess. You're spreading your guys too thin. They ought to be out there rubber-necking and puppy-dogging and not playing valet to a bunch of -- of freeloaders. Well, it's a numbers game, Daddy. More people on the lot, more cars off the lot. So you expect to pry open the fist of somebody who drives all the way across town just to get a free car wash? We already got one. Reggie just sold a Cruze to a car-wash customer just yesterday. You got them backed up to the street. That isn't right. What's the holdup? I don't know, but they're out for blood. Didn't anybody hear me?! Dude, what are you doing? What do you think I'm doing?! And then after 10 minutes of sitting there with the -- with the lights and the noise, I-I panicked, you know, and made a run for it. There, there, baby new year. Don't poop your pants. It's not funny. Okay, okay, guys. Uh, give it a rest. Here you go. It probably just jammed from overuse, all right? I'll have Jesse check it. I don't care what he does. I'm not going back in there, okay? You hired me to sell cars, not wash them. Yeah, he's kind of right. Why are we even doing this thing? Well, we're doing this thing because, um, I thought it would help us sell more cars. Who needs help? I've sold more cars this month than I ever have. Um, yeah, well, um... Uh, this place is so far in the red that, um, I need you to sell even more. Yeah, screw it. I mean, you're all adults. It's time you should know what's going on around here. We were not ready for this recession, and it kicked our asses bad. Thoreau's not dead -- not yet -- but to get stronger, I need you all to step it up even further. I believe in what we're doing here. I believe in you guys. All right? And I know that together, we can come up with all kinds of ideas that'll put us right back on top again, because otherwise, I got to keep that car wash running, and, um, let's be honest -- that thing sucks, right? I mean, whose shitty idea was that, anyway? Oh, man, I don't know whether to keep my gap wedge or my lob wedge. If my driver's working, then I want my gap wedge. But, oh, this course plays long. Take the gap wedge. Yeah? Why? 'Cause now it's lucky. Yeah, okay. Guy's got to listen to his caddie, right? Good luck, man. Now on the tee, from Reseda, California, Greg Ristich. Hey, hey, what's that? You okay? I'm praying. Should I stop? No. No, no. You give it all you got. Now on the tee, from Los Angeles, California, Joe Tranelli. Whoo! Nice job. Yeah. Hey, you too. Sorry about the inconvenience, folks. Hey. But the car wash is out of order. Uh, okay. Well, I guess this contract doesn't mean much then, huh? Well, it's not exactly a contract. It's a promotion. But, um -- hey, weren't you here yesterday? Yeah. It says -- it says right here, "all month." It doesn't say there's a limit, so, yeah. Right, but, unfortunately, we're just, uh, not up and running today. But, um, I can offer you an oil change -- No. Nope, nope. I drove out of my way on account of the free car wash. This place is a joke. Stop lying to people! Hey, Lucy, how's he doing? Great. He's got this for birdie. What do you think? Looks straight to me. Yeah. All right. Yeah! Thatababy! You the man, Joe. Sorry. He is my friend. And, uh, he is -- he is the man. Hey, that wasn't so bad. I think we even steered a few of them to service. What the hell was that? Excuse me? Airing our laundry in front of the entire sales staff. That is our private business. Daddy, you -- you handle things your way. I'll handle mine. Oh, I can see that -- car-wash scams and leprechauns. Bait and switch! Now what the hell is that? Bait and switch! Stop Thoreau! Son of a bitch. All right, you can't pray every hole. He's gonna cut you off. We've got too many clubs. What? The wedge -- I meant to take it to the car after the range, but, uh -- Mr. Tranelli, you're on the tee. Uh, we got 15 clubs. There was a mix-up on the range, but, yeah, um, we're over the limit. That's a 2-stroke penalty. Yeah, we know. Tranelli -- 2-stroke penalty. You're on the tee. Yeah. Dad, I'm so sorry. That's okay. It's all right, man. It happens. Oh, come on, Joe. It's all right. It's okay. He's just having a couple of bad holes. He'll turn it around. I can't believe this. Hey, hey, hey. What's up? What's going on? You played the first hole perfect. And then I screwed up, and now you're playing like crap. And you're gonna bogey this hole, and then you've got no chance at this. Hey, you know, uh, caddie's supposed to stay positive, Albert. Why'd you bring me here? I'm -- I'm ruining this for you. I-I just can't believe I forgot that stupid club! Hey, hey, hey, hey. You didn't forget the club. We forgot the club. If you didn't notice it when you did, I would've got a penalty on the next hole, I'd be 5 over right now. Hey, look, look, look. Albert. Come on, we're in this together -- you, me, even Lucy with her little pink butterflies. We're a team, okay? I need you. I need you right here, right now, not back on the range, where we can't change a damn thing. Okay? Okay. All right. You got any advice for me? 'Cause I'm kind of shitting the bed right now. Why don't you just play like you played the first hole? Yeah, okay. I'm gonna try that. And, hey, I'm sorry I cursed, but, um, I was just trying to get you, you know, focused. Bait and switch! Stop Thoreau! Bait and switch! Hey, hey, hey! What's your problem, man? I just want to be heard. The whole world's out to scam a buck, and I have had it! Bait and switch! Stop Thoreau! Okay, look. Uh, look. It was wrong of us to promise something we couldn't deliver, so, uh, what I'd like to do is wash your car right now. Hand wash, detail, whole works. What do you say? Well, I guess that sounds fair. I just want what is fair. Yeah. Um, grab his keys, and, uh, let's get him started. All right. No, no, no, no. Stop right there, Lawrence. Freebies are over. Really? I have a flyer, sir, that you put on my car. I didn't put shit. Daddy, Dad-- That's fine. I'm not leaving until I get my car washed. Off of my property, wacko! Daddy! Good. No, that's good. Go ahead, go ahead. Show the world how you treat your customers. Freak show's over. Freak show's over. Let go of me! Daddy! Let's go! I'm getting this. I am getting this. Damn it, Daddy! Stop! Sky hook! I'll see you in court! So, what the hell was that all about? I was getting him to leave. Well, now he's gone for good. Who are you trying to beat here, Daddy, him or me? The hell is that supposed to mean? Go out there and get that damn thing before it gives somebody a flat tire. Come on. Uh... You don't have to do that, Lawrence. Somebody get that damn thing out of the road. Oh, so that's how it's gonna be, huh? Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! Get your hands off of me. This place is beyond repair. How's your day going? Great. Well, that makes one of us. Well, maybe not great. Kind of got into a thing with Erin this morning, you know, and I'm starting to feel like, you know, maybe I screwed everything up. And, you know, I-I really don't want that to happen this time, be... Oh, geez, sorry. Sorry, Joe. Everything's great. 175 front, 88 to the pin. You can punch out to 110 and get up and down for bogey. Yeah, how about a hard cut? Hold your finish. Yep. Whoa! Thataboy, Joe! We're done making bogeys. Oh, not the water. Whoo! Come on, you mother. Golf shot. Thanks. Yeah! Whoo! Dad, if you knock this in, you'll be tied for fifth. You'll make the cut. I kind of wish I didn't know that. Drain it, Joe. Yeah. Come on, Dad. You can do it. What do you think? Mind's-eye that shit. You're focused, right? Yeah. Oh! All right, um, sixth place. He's still in the hunt. He's still alive. Somebody might screw up. Oh, Joe. Too bad. It was damned exciting. Yeah, until the end, right? Well, I don't know. Kind of like, um, "Rocky," you know? You put up a good fight, you didn't make the cut, but so what. You're gonna get back into the ring. Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it, but, uh, really, I'm fine. I'm good. I mean, you know, I thought -- I thought I needed this, but, uh... I don't think I do. Did you see Albert and Lucy out there today? Yeah. That's enough. It should be. Listen, uh, you okay if I go? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go. I know I told you not to come, but glad you were a dick and ignored me. All right, man. Thanks. Yeah. Oh. Really? Come on. Oh, for real? For real? Okay, uh, we're all here. Um, I guess it'd be an understatement to say that, uh, these are interesting times, right? No, seriously. I know that what happened this afternoon must seem crazy. Hell, this whole year must seem crazy. But I want you to know, while our situation isn't ideal, these are damn good sales numbers, and they're only gonna get better. But more importantly, um, I really appreciate you standing by me. Um, I can't do this without you. All of you. So thank you. Yeah. Whoo! Well, um... Enough of the heavy shit. Um, without further ado, I give you, for the first time ever, from worst to first, our very own mini movie star, Lawrence Bedard... Ohh! ...Salesman of the month! Oh! Thank you. Congratulations.

Where's your brother? He's got to be hungry, too, right? On the course, trying to jinx the guys ahead of you who haven't finished yet. Albert, why are you doing this to yourself? Yeah. I know, right? And now it's raining, so he's gonna get soaked. Rain? Dad! It's raining! Okay, um, just take it easy. Guys can play in the rain. Not old guys. Everybody out there is toast. Not everybody -- if this guy makes his putt, then he and dad would have a playoff for fifth place. Oh, man. That's a gimme. But you could beat him in a playoff. You have a better drive, and your mind's eye -- Okay, shush, shush, shush. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my! Dad! You're in! You're in! You're in! You're in! Guys, guys. Oh, my God, dad! Okay, easy, guys. Shh. Guys, guys, guys. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! You guys, quiet. Oh, my God! Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet. Okay, all right, guys. Come on. Shh, shh. Come on. Daddy, about this afternoon -- No, forget about that. The thing is, when I said I was leaving the business, should have left the business. But, you know, when you do something for so long, sometimes, well, just not that simple. Oh, Daddy, you're always gonna be the face of this store, you know? Anytime you want to come in and -- Son, you and I can't make a sandwich together. No, I've had my time, and a man should go out with dignity. So I talked to Scarpulla, and I got him to up his offer by 15%. What? Yeah. You know, he was low-balling you with that first offer. I showed him he's not the only one in this town that understands a value. He called you? Well, it doesn't matter how it happened. The point is I said yes. I'm selling. Yeah, but -- but -- but what about our customers? We have relationships, and -- nonsense. Internet killed all of that. And our employees? If they're any good, Scarpulla will snap them up. And what about me? Well, what do you think, that I'm not gonna take care of you and Melissa? I don't want you to take care of us. I want to take care of us. You should be truthful with yourself, son. You resented this place every single day you were here. All that's changed, and you know it. I've thrown everything I could possibly throw into this place. I'm sweating blood to get us out of the hole that you dug, so please don't pretend. What am I supposed to do if you do this? Go into real estate or become a teacher or some shit like that? I've got nothing else. Do you understand that? This is what I do. It's just business, son. You are one pathetic old man. Alright guys. I got to tell mom. Yeah, not about the cursing, all right? That's just our thing. Do you want to come in? Me? Yeah. Um...Nah. No, let me go. I should get going home. Sure? All right. Yeah. Or I could come to your place. I don't know. If you want. No. Why? You have... Why? What's the matter? I don't know. This was a big day for you. It seems weird for you to have to go home and be alone. Yeah, you don't have to worry about me. Okay. No, I'm good. I'm not gonna be alone. I'm gonna -- look, I got these. Mm-hmm. I think there's a PGA regulation against these many colors on a ball. Think we'll get away with it? I love you, Dad. You too. Bye. Bye. Hello? You okay? It's almost 9:00. I thought we pretty much cleaned up already. Yeah, we did. I just came to do a dummy check, and I guess I got a little nostalgic. I mean, you know, you're in a place 10 years, it seems weird to just leave it. Yeah. But y-you still want to, right? Erin, look, I -- I'm sorry for springing all that on you this morning. What are you doing? I mean, you know, we -- we rushed into this. We -- actually, we totally rushed into this, and I was okay with it because it felt right. And, you know, if it feels right, why waste time, you know, at this age? But we're supposed to be building a life together. And that's what I want. So you're gonna start a whole new career at 50 'cause of a car commercial? Do you follow golf at all? Yeah. Of course you don't. It's boring. But Joe's thing, the senior tour -- it's like a do-over, right? At 50, he gets to start all over again, blank slate. Look, I wasted a lot of my life. I told myself I was working hard at acting, and I was just drifting. I didn't even have a cellphone. Now I feel like I'm a different person, and I want that guy to have a shot at what the other guy screwed up. And you -- you need to know that I'm never gonna sponge off of you or -- or ask you to pick up the slack. I begged Slavitter today for my job back as a building manager, you know? So that -- I-I took care of that. I bet that was fun. Yeah, well, he -- he enjoyed it. Mm-hmm. Give me a year. And if it doesn't work out, then I'll go back to selling cars. Olsens finally trimmed their hedge. No, I did that. Couldn't wait another five years. Threw the clippings over in their yard, though. What's he gonna do, little short Swedish son of a bitch? I don't know what happened. It's all just going away. Daddy. You built that place. You gave it every ounce of blood and sweat that you had in you. I understand... ...What that means now. And you still want it? I do. Aah! Hello? Hey, hi. Uh, Dori, it's Joe...Tranelli. Hey, yeah, hi, Joe. Everything okay? Yeah, no. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I just, uh -- I'm just calling 'cause, um, well, I played in the prequalifier for the senior tournament, and I just -- I made it to the next round. You're kidding! That's great! Congratulations. Yeah, thank you. Thanks. Sort of backed in, but, um...I did it. Dori? Yeah, no, I'm here. I just -- I'm just remembering how important that was to you. That is so great. I'm -- I'm really happy for you. Yeah, thanks, thanks. Um, so, anyway, I think, uh, next week, I'm coming in for a follow-up on this tooth. Are you gonna be there? Uh...I think so. Okay. All right, great. So then I guess I'll see you then. Yeah, I guess you will. Yeah. Okay, I'll see you. Bye, Joe. Bye-bye. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
