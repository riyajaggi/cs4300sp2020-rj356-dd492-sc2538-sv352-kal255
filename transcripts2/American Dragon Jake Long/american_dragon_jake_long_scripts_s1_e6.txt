 Jake! get back to work! Aw, man. (KNOCKING) Hey, wake up. Wake up. Come on, mom. (SIGHS IN EXASPERATION) Just 10 more minutes. (GROANS) (SCREAMING) Hey, hey, he put me out. Come on. Hey, hey, pal, come on. Hurry. Aah! What? Tail of the dragon. Huh? You gotta let me in. I'm a troll. My parents have this whole thing about not letting strange creatures into the house. Hey, it's your job as the American Dragon to protect me. Protect you? From who? Not who. That! The sun. My hair will burn it if it hits me. And if my hair burns--oh, take my word for it-- Really bad things will happen. For real? Why do you think trolls live under bridges and in the sewers? The sun is our poison. I guess that makes sense. Ok, I'll let you in, but only for a little-- whoa! Uhh! Thanks. That was a close one. Ok. Now I just have to stay out of the sun until, uh, nighttime. Nighttime tonight? Uh-uh. Sorry, dude. That ain't gonna work. Ok. I can take a hint. It's obvious that you hate me! (SOBBING LOUDLY) All right. Ok. You can stay here, But you can't let my dad see you. Whoo-hoo! Or hear you! He doesn't exactly know about the existence of magical creatures. See, my mom's been working on telling him since October... Of '92. MAN: Jake... Quick! you gotta hide. Uhh...Whoa! Check it. This is the guest bedroom. We almost never have visitors. You'll be safe here. Cool? These shoes are stale. -You got any boogers? -WOMAN: Jake... Aah! Don't let it eat me. Shh! That's my mom. TROLL: Could I get a glass of water? (SIGHS) Man, what a freak. Mom, I need to talk to you for a sec. Can it wait, sweetie? Your dad and I are on our way to the airport. Well, your Aunt Patchouli is coming to town today, and we do not want her getting lost on the subway. She's coming here? Today? To crash in the shoe room? That's right, and don't forget, you promised to vacuum before she gets here. Hey, yeah, sure. No problem. -(GASPS) -Well, have a nice drive, And don't be afraid to take the slow lane. Dude, I asked you to stay in the bedroom. Dude, I asked you for a glass of water. So we're even. Look, we gotta figure out another place for you to hide. My aunt is coming, and she's gonna be staying in the-- GIRL: Jake... What is that? My sister. -GIRL: Where's the remote control? -Hide! Ooh, uh, uh. Ooh! Hey, Haley. Ha, what's up? Why is there a troll in the fridge? Ha ha. Ok, look, Haley. This troll is gonna hide here for a while, but this is gonna be a secret. Hmm... I'm telling mom. Well, I'm glad that's settled. I better get ready for my date. Date? Since w-w-- you didn't tell me you had a date. (CHUCKLES) Hey, some things are private. (ELECTRONIC RAZOR BUZZING) Ugh! Could this be one of them? Gross! (DOORBELL RINGS) Maybe that's for me. No! wait here. No, wait. Wait here. No, wait-- Wait here. Ugh! -(DOORBELL RINGS) -Coming! -Hey. -Aunt Patchouli. You're not supposed to be here. Not, I mean, not here yet. (LAUGHING) I took an early flight. -Where's your mom and dad? -At the airport looking for you. (SIGHS) Your father. You'd think I'd never been on a subway. Oh, hi. I'm at your house, where do you think? You are such a head case. (TROLL SINGING) Ok. I'll see you in a bit. I don't know what he was thinking. I used to live here when I was in college. So, where's my favorite little girl? Aunt Patchouli! Whatever you do, don't take a shower. (GIGGLING) Ooh, you know, actually I could use a shower now that you mention it. No! Wait. La, la, la ba, ba, ba, da JAKE: Aunt Patchouli, let me, um, Show you where the clean towels are. What? Ooh. Ooh. Aah! Sun. I'm just gonna check on that towel situation for you. Gonna be right back. Oh, oh. (SCREAMS) Nose of the dragon. Ha ha! take that, hairball. Oh, hey. Towels on the-- towel rack. Imagine that. Thank you, and now if you don't mind-- Sure thing. No prob. I'll just be outside if you need anything. You are so busted. (GIGGLES) (OPERATIC SINGING) Ooh. Ahh. (SNIFFING) Ew. Hey, Jakey, are you sure these towels are clean, honey? (OPERATIC SINGING) Come on. Wait. Do you smell burning hair? Yeah. I burned up that nasty hairball you left in the sink. What? I was trying to stay out of the sun for a reason. Do you have any idea what happens when you burn troll hair? (HUMMING) Hey. Ouch! Aunt Patchouli. I put your things in Haley's room right here. (CREATURES GRUMBLING) Could this get any worse? MOM AND DAD: We're home. Aw, man. Mommy, daddy, guess what? Aunt Patty's here! And you know what else? (MUFFLED SPEAKING) There they are. Patty, we would've picked you up at the airport. Like I need a chaperone. Come here, you. Quick, hide him! -Please? -Where? I don't care! Anywhere. Hmm. So I bet you can't wait to get out and do some sightseeing, huh, Aunt Patchouli? Where are you two taking her first? Statue of Liberty? Empire State Building? TROLL: Aah! Oh, I can't go anywhere. I'm meeting someone here. Here? At the house? Oh, is it that special someone you told us about in your letter? We're just old friends, but I think he's taking me to dinner! So you're gonna stay here... All day? -(FUR BALLS CLAMORING) -What on earth was that? Rats! in the attic! Doh! I'll go get the new traps. No! I mean, uh... Uh, I'll take care of it, pop. (WHISPERS) Hide him in the basement! I'll handle the fur balls. Come on! You mean down there? Uh-oh. Oh, boy. (FUR BALLS SNARLING) All right, dust bunnies. Come to papa. Dragon up! (VOCALIZING) You all want some of this? Whoo! Ha!
