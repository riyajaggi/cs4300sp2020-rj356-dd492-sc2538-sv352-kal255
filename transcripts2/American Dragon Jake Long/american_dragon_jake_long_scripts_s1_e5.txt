It's showtime, baby, for the legacy American Dragon From the "J" to the "A" to the "K" to the "E" I'm the Mackdaddy Dragon of the NYC Ya heard! Jake! Get back to work! Aw, man. (GONG) So, you're sayin' that bug can actually bring junk to life? That's what my Gramps says. You need to hold it over Spud's head and wake up some of them brain cells. Good luck. These little dudes are heavy sleepers. Oh, they're so cute when they're sleepy. Ooh! Smoke! Hey, yo, ga ga boy, if you're still hot for that Rose girl, just ask her out already and make the suffering a wrap. Ask her out? No way, Trix. Mack Daddy Jake's gotta play it cool. Watch and learn. Uh... (CHUCKLES) What up, Rose? Haven't had a chance to dance with you since the talk. I mean, talk to you since the chance. I mean... All I'm learning is that Jake Daddy Mack's English is wack! It's cool. I know what you mean. It's good to see you, too. Cleopatra! Rehearsal's in 5! Uh, did Miss Jenkins just call you Cleopatra? Yeah. The drama club's doing Antony and Cleopatra for the Shakespeare in the Park celebration next week. And Miss Rose is the queen of my Nile. Now, come on, sugar, the curtain calls! So, Jake, I'll, uh, see you soon? Soon? Don't be absurd! You are to spend the next week eating, drinking, and scene studying Antony and Cleopatra. Sorry. Now, we just need to work on finding you an Antony! Antony, huh? As in Cleopatra's main squeeze? No! Jake! Please tell me you're not gonna be in some play just so you can be all up in Rose's grill? (BLUES MUSIC PLAYING) Yo! Cleo P. Forsooth, your Antony has arrived. Then I suggest we rehearse. So it should be, that none but Antony Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so! Yo, yo, yo, yo. Check it. I am dying, Egypt, dying; only I here importune death awhile, until of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips. FU: Kid! Stop! You don't know where that's been! Huh? Aah! Aah! Heh heh. Jake, have you heard a single word I have said? Uh, sure. You were just saying... An ancient Chinese proverb that holds the key to me learning a really valuable lesson? -(CHITTERING) -FU: Gramps was saying you're supposed to protect the scarab beetle until we figure out a way to get it back to Egypt. Hey, what? No problem. I'm all over that. So, uh, does anybody know what "importune" means? HUNTSMAN: Blast that American Dragon! We'll pick up the search tomorrow. We will find him... And the beetle. For all we know, the dragons have already sent it back to Egypt. Maybe we should just give up and... Give up? Those dragons need to be slain! Never forget that! It is your calling, as it is mine... As it is theirs. I understand, Huntsmaster. But what's so important about this one Egyptian bug? For generations, the Huntsclan have hunted magical creatures. And for generations, dragons have stood in their way. Well, no more. Once we locate the scarab, we will use its life-giving powers to revive past generations of Huntsclan. Hundreds shall be reborn and become my army. An army which will wipe out dragons forever! (LAUGHING MANIACALLY) Peace! Not Cæsar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony, But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself. So, does the Bradster get to lock lips with Cleopatra now or later? (SPEAKING SPANISH) I'm a pretty good forward, eh, but what I really want to be is goalie. -(FEEDBACK) -This is hockey tryouts, right? Um, I'm auditioning for understudy on account of I have the entire works of Shakespeare committed to memory. And, as an added bonus, I rock! Yeah! Whoo! (IMITATING GUITAR) Yo, yo, yo, yo! Pay attention! 'Cause Jake Long is in the hizzie! About to audition for my man marc antonizzie. (GASPS) I am dying, Egypt, dying; only I here importune death awhile, until of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips. Yo, Trix! My plan worked! I totally got the part! And I get to be his understudy! Jake! Just shut down the whole Mack Daddy game and straight up ask your little dime piece out! Yo, yo, yo, yo! Cleo P! Uh, forsooth, your Antony has arrived. Oh... I try. I know you do, honey. I know you do. Oh, Jake, this is gonna be so great. I can't wait to start rehearsing. My thoughts exactly. How about some one-on-one rehearsal time for the two leads? Your place after school? Uh, my place probably isn't such a good idea. That's cool. I know where we can go. ROSE: Antony and Cleopatra are natural enemies, forced to choose between love and responsibility to their cause. Oh, love and responsibility. Yeah, I think I got it. Ahem. So, I was thinking, maybe we should skip to Act 4, Scene 15. Huh? You mean the scene with the kiss? Right now? Yeah. It's the emotional centerpiece of the play. -Is that cool? -Pfft! Yeah! Sure! Totally cool! Because I've kissed girls before. Totally... Kissed girls... Before. Thanks, Mommy, that was the best bedtime story ever! Aunt Patty, you're here! Oh, come here, Princess. Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah! It's not just a kiss, Jake. It's what the kiss represents, the totally intense connection between them. It doesn't just happen, it happens because they're ready to completely surrender to each other. So, are you ready? (GULPS) Huh? Oh, sure. Yeah. Ready? Totally ready for Act 4, Scene 15. -Jerky? -Excuse me? Uh, my Grandpa whipped up some for his mah-jong buddies. (CHOMPS) Mmm. It's a little bland. You know where they have good jerky? Jersey. Or as I like to call it, New Jerky! -Uh, are you okay? -Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, fine. I'm just gonna run over to New Jerky and... Whoa! (CHITTERING) -What was that? -N-nothing! Aw, man! What do you mean, you lost the beetle? I don't know what happened. I was just rehearsing lines with Rose, and then there was... Tripping and jerky. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Rehearsing lines? For what? The school play. I'm Antony, she's Cleopatra. Jake, your responsibilities as the American Dragon are to protect magical creatures, not flirt with schoolgirls! Yeah, what were you thinking? Act 4, scene 15, huh? Whoo, whoo, whoo! Don't worry, Gramps. I'll find the beetle. I promise. Oh... So, you finally planted a big old smoocherino on Miss Rose or what, huh? Mwah, mwah, mwah! I tried, but I... I just...Freaked. Ah, don't worry, kid, everybody freaks their first kiss. (LAUGHS) My first time, her hair extensions got caught in my wrinkles, and... 'Cause we were... And then the... Uh, never mind. The point is, it'll happen when it's right. No pressure. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) So, getting cozy with Rosey, eh? Act 4, scene 15. You go, player. You lock lips with Rose yet or what? Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah. Hey! Sorry, y'all. Uh, the mad player Jake don't kiss and tell. Rose, hey, about last night... Jake, I am so sorry. It's just, Act 4, Scene 15 is such a passionate part of the play. I really want to get it right. I'm sorry if I freaked you out. Me? Freaked out? Pfft! Rose, please. Jake Long is all about the passion. I just... Uh, I just wanted to make sure you weren't freaked out. Oh, not at all. So, should we pick up rehearsals tonight? Totally! How about your place? -Well, I guess we could, but... -Cool. Your place it is then. (CHITTERING) This is some crib you got here! Seriously, my church isn't this big! ROSE: I live here with my, um, uncle. This is like his castle. I made us some punch. Mmm... Passion fruit! Yeah. So... In this next scene, Antony visits Cleopatra in Egypt, which to him is enemy territory. Uh-huh, uh-huh. So, you want to do Act 4, Scene 15 or what? Uh, are you cool with that? Because we don't have to if... No, no, no, no, no. I'm cool! Totally cool. Okay, here we go. Quicken with kissing; had my lips that power, Thus would I wear them out. (THINKING) Be cool, dude. Be cool. Mack Daddy cool. It's just a kiss. Here it comes. She's leaning in. Just do what she does. (DOOR OPENS) -Aah! My uncle! -Aah! -He's home early. You have to hide. -Whoa! Sorry, he's, uh, really strict. (CHITTERING) HUNTSMASTER: Why was the door bolted and latched in six places? ROSE: Uh, you never can be too safe. HUNTSMASTER: Is there someone here? ROSE: I swear. It's just me. Here alone. All by my lonesome. (SIGHS) HUNTSMASTER: I have an idea how to proceed with our mission. Follow me. Unh! Whoa! I'm really sorry. Call you later. Bye! (MUFFLED) Aw, man. (MOTOR WHIRRING) (AIR HISSES) So, Huntsmaster, what is your plan? We may not know the American Dragon's human identity, but we know the dragon master's. He is our key to finding the scarab. (CHITTERING) That's it, kid. Concentration and balance are a key part of drag... -(KNOCK ON DOOR) -Knock, knock. Whoa! Unh! (BIRDS CHIRPING) Hey! Rose! Uh, just doing my morning stretches. What's, uh, going on? I wanted to apologize for last night. It's just... My uncle is super strict, and... GRANDPA: Jake! If that's a customer with a return, tell them electronics are like bikinis! All sales are final! (SCOFFS) Yeah. My grandpa can be pretty strict sometimes, too. -(SNIFFING) -So, I guess we need -to find a new place to rehearse. -But your place is perfect! In fact, let's go there right now. Come on. Jake, I told you. We can't. What about your house? My house? Mwah, mwah, mwah! Ha! So, this is the Rose we've heard so much about! Hey, you know, son, I think it's time we had... (WHISPERING) "The talk." My house is being fumigated. But I think I know somewhere else we can go. Quicken with kissing; had my lips that power, Thus would I wear them out. (TRIXIE GAGS) Okay, look. Just because I said you could rehearse at my place doesn't mean I gotta watch. Come on, Spud. -But it's Act 4, Scene 15. -Baah! See you, Grandma. Me and Spud, we out! GRANDMA: Take a Coke, sweetie, and bring Grandma back a carton of milk! Well, looks like we're alone. -(GRANDMA COUGHING, HACKING, AND SPITTING) -Sort of. Jake, I think I know why we're having trouble with Act 4, Scene 15. Trouble? W-w-what trouble? I'm not having any trouble. We haven't earned it. See, Antony and Cleopatra have been through so much together. But we haven't been through anything togeth... (CHITTERING) -Oh, no! -No way! Uh, you mind if we take five before we start rehearsing? I need to use the bathroom. Good idea! I need some air. Dragon up! (ROARING) (GRUNTING) Yeah! Hyah! Dragon, let's make this quick. Works for me. (CHITTERING) (GRUNTING) Waah! Whoa! GRANDMA: Will you kids turn down the TV? That kung fu movie sounds like it's coming through the roof! (BOTH GRUNTING) BOTH: Where'd it go? I so don't have time for this. Would you mind if we take five more minutes? I have to use the bathroom. Good idea. I need some air. Hyah! Hyah! (BOTH GRUNTING) (CHITTERING) That's it... Hold still... Ha! Finally! My army of Huntsclan can now be reborn! Aw, man! You are sure you heard him correctly? Yeah. He said his army of Huntsclan can now be reborn. Oh, yep. According to my potions book, the scarab beetle is a key ingredient in a spell that brings the dead back to life. -Whoa... -This is all my fault, G. If I'd just listened to you and stopped obsessing over Rose. Do not worry, Jake. Grandpa has been there, too. Young, wide-eyed, easily blinded by beauty and passion and... Whoa, whoa, whoa, G! TMI! You know what that stands for? Too much information. Besides, I found something else. It seems the spell can only be done under the light of a full moon, Which just so happens to be tonight. Aah! Heh heh heh. But tonight's the play! Which I can... Totally miss, because this is way more important. We have two hours to locate the tomb of the Huntsclan. Sorry, dude. So far, my Internet search is turning up nada. But on the plus side, I found a killer coupon for the new Juiceteria on 34th Street! -Rose, there's something I have to tell... -Jake, there's something I have to tell... You first. No, you first. -I can't do the play tonight! -I can't do the play tonight! -Aah! -Huh? I'm really sorry to bail on you again, but this... Family thing came up. Really? Me...Too. I guess Act 4, Scene 15 was never meant to be. Although, my family thing shouldn't last too long. If I leave now, I think I can make it back in time. Really? Me... Too! It's a date! SPUD: Dude, I think I found something! All right, according to this urban myth website, there's a cave near the southern rim of the park. A few years back, some dude went into it and was never seen again. Then a month later, they found his camera, along with this picture. Da da dum That's it! Spud, you rock! Dude, tell me something I don't need to know. (IMITATING GUITAR) I'll be back. No matter what happens, keep the play going long enough for Act 4, Scene 15! Votas existo exercitus! Dorkus-freako, give-it-upis! Dragons! And dog! -Unh! -Unh! (BLOWING) -Unh! -Unh! (CHITTERING) My dearest Cleopatra. There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd. (HIGH VOICE) Oh, Antony. I'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd. He's doing both roles! You! On stage! You're my new Cleopatra! Uh, yo, I ain't trying to go up on stage. I'm just here to show my bud Spud some support. Waah! Aah! (BOTH GRUNTING) Kid! Whatever you do, keep the scarab out of the moonlight! (MUMBLING NERVOUSLY) Unh! (CHITTERING) (GROANS) (GRUNTS) I tell the kid, but does he listen? There's not a minute of our lives should stretch without some pleasure now. What sport to-night? Hey, yo, Antony. Peep game! (LAUGHTER) I don't know what you crackalatin' in that Roman head of yours, but y'all better bow down and respect the Nubian queen, baby. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Somebody yank her booty off! Oh... Ha! Gotcha! What? Gramps! Hand over the beetle, old man. Hyah! Hyah! Unh! Sorry, Huntspunk, can't finish the spell without a spell book. Finish him! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn (BOTH GRUNTING) Aah! No! (GRUNTING) Another day, dragons. Whoo-hoo! Way to go, kid! Well done, young dragon. You know, if you leave now, you can still make it back for Act 4, Scene 15. Thanks, G. If you'll excuse me, I have an Egyptian queen to kiss. Holla! Oh, Jake! You're just in time for the kiss! Go out there and save my play! I am dying, Egypt, dying; only I here importune death awhile, until of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay up thy lips. What up, dude? Trixie got the hook, but I kept the play going just like you said. What? But, uh, where's Rose? Come on! What are you waiting for? Aw, man. (AUDIENCE GASPING) JAKE: Yuck! Yuck! (SPITS) Hey, Rose, I... Whoa! What happened? I'm such a klutz. While I was at my, um, family thing, I totally fell and sprained my ankle. That's why I didn't make it back last night. Hey, it's, uh, cool. I...I'm just glad you're okay. Ha ha! Well, you know, baby, they're doing Shakespeare on Ice in Rockefeller Center this winter, and the Mack Daddy Jake was thinking, I audition for Romeo, you Juliet, and... A-a-a-ahem! Better yet, maybe, um, we could just go out on a real date sometime, just you and me. Yeah. I'd like that. Talk to you later? Definitely. Dude, you did it! You asked her out! Finally! I was getting impatient with you! I told you, Jake, you could do it. How hard was that, player? -(BIRDS CHIRPING) -TRIXIE: Uh, Jake?
