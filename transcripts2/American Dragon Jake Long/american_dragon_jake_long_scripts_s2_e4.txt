 Come on, Jakey. The regional double-dutch championships are next week. We gotta put in the hours before we hit the showers -I can't. I have to do my... -Chores. You're gonna have to help out more. I need you to baby-sit the trash and take out your sister. Stop. Reverse that. Trash out, sister-sit. But, Mom, I'm swamped and... Late for dragon training. -Sorry, Gramps. -Young one, time management is a dragon skill every bit as important as breathing fire or flying. But it's not fair. I'm trying to ace two lives over here, remember? That is why I am giving you this personal digital assistant.

So what's the big emergency? As the Hunstclan grows stronger we must prepare you with more powerful dragon defenses. Observe, young one. Huh? No way. How did you hone that clone? Dragons have the ability to project their chi energy into a copy of themselves. A doppelganger. It can provide a useful decoy in battle. -MAN: Get that unicorn. -(ANIMAL NEIGHS) Speaking of battle... Run! MAN 2: Slow and easy, boys. You know how much unicorn horn goes for on the black market? -(MAN GROANS) -Young dragon, this is a perfect opportunity for you to try the doppelganger decoy technique. Two of me. Yeah. I dig the sound of that. Dragon up. Concentrate your chi energy, Jake. Project it forward. (GRUNTS) Release the inner energy, young dragon. (GRUNTS) (BURPS) Excuse me. (SIGHS) (GRUNTS) Okay, I know I laid down a decoy that time. How is it looking? Well, kid, it is distracting. Loo-ga-loo! (ALL LAUGHING) -(MAN LAUGHING) -Oh, come on. It is late. You will have to master the doppelganger in your free time. Free time? I don't have any free time. I don't have any time at all. I will be off reporting to the Dragon Council this week. Master the decoy by the time I return. But for now, young one, it is time for you to sleep. (SIGHS) Sleep. Sleep. -(ALARM BUZZING) -(YELPS) It's 7 a.m. school is waiting, Princess Cinder-lazy. Up and at 'em! Up and at 'em! Up and at 'em! Good of you to join us, Mr. Long. I wasn't aware it was pajama day. Say what? Aw, man. Jakey, are you sleeping? (SNORES) HALEY: Jake, you're supposed to be watching me. Huh? I'm at a developmental age where I need a lot of one-on-one attention. -(GRUNTS) -Hey! Hiya-ho there, family. Jake, you are gonna be tickled pink camouflage when you hear what I did. Yep. I signed you up for advanced wilderness survival training with the cougar scouts. But, dad, I'm kind of booked up. And we live in the middle of the city. Hey, mister, I don't care how big-city mouse you are. A growing boy needs to know his basic survival skills. Tying knots, lighting fires, whittling wood, and, of course, the ol' making dancing acorn finger puppets. I can't take much more of this. Now, absorb that cheap imitation and try, try again. Fu, can't you help a player out? You know, hook me up with a little magical mojo. No. Forget it, kid. No shortcuts. All right. But I feel another birthday-suit me about to pop. Oh, okay, Uncle. Enough. Here. Here. Sprinkle a little of this in the air before you concentrate. It'll help amplify your chi energy. Now, that's what I'm talking about. Ho-ho! We have a winner of the Jake Long look-alike contest. -Goo-goo! -Hmm? Yo, check me out. I did it. Dang. Do I really look this good? Congratulations, kid. Let's call it a night. Reabsorb that baby and you can try doing it without the magic training wheels tomorrow. But I got cougar scout training. I also got to study, go to jump-rope practice, take care of Haley, do my chores. How is one person supposed to do all that? So how's your calendar looking for the next week, my man? JAKE: Okay. So I'll take the sleeping. You'll take the garbage. I'll take the napping. You'll take the algebra. Algebra? Aw, man. Wow. You really are my double. I don't know. This seems highly irregular. Oops. Rolling blackout. Don't you dare! Where's my newest little cougar? No. It's Dad. We got to hide. A scouty howdy to you, Jake my boy. Are you ready for cougar scouts? Uh. Scouty howdy right back at cha. I sure am. Let me hear you shout, shout I am a cougar scout, scout. (ROARS) So no one thought there was anything wack about you? Not even my dad? -Nope. -Sweet. From now on, cougar scout training is your thing. -You're all over it. -Like smoke on a campfire. Great. But I still got to study for school, do my chores around the house. All right, you're study boy me, double-dutch me, chore hound me. Chop chop. Time's a-wastin'. Finally, Fu's chi amplifier comes through in a pinch. Nothing to do but sleep, chill, and relax. Man, all this nothing to do is exhausting. Wonder how my doppel bros are hanging. Then Olivia Meer said if I was such a know-it-all, why didn't I know pigtails are so second grade? Oh. No, she didn't, girl. Guess what. It's Steve Hardy time. (BOTH CHEER) Son, this is by far the best full-body tourniquet I have ever seen. Thanks, Dad. That would be Mesopotamia. Jake, I am so proud. I could tap the budenschlavens on my lederhosen. Come. A celebratory jig. Hit it, Frederick. (BLOWING) (SINGING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) Okay, now I'm just scaring myself. Ooh, Jakey. You on fire, boy! -Hey. -SPUD: Trix, come here. I'll show you a trick. Look, I'm gonna take over here. -Cool? -But this is what I do. It's who I am. I jump rope. That's all I have. Come on. Give it up. (GRUNTING) (YELPS) (GRUNTING) (LAUGHTER) Okay, who tripped the Bradster? (WHIMPERS) Oh, look. It's doofus. Wanna jump rope? The only jumping I'm gonna do is on your face with my fist, which isn't jumping, but it's still gonna hurt. Psst. Brad, teacher. Twelve o'clock. Meet me at the skate park, 3:00. I can't do it today 'cause I have accordion lessons after school. So 3:00 tomorrow. If you don't show, everyone's gonna know you're a chicken. (CLUCKING) Aw, man. Guys, this Brad sitch is serious. I-- Aw. Okay, who dealt it? -ALL: Not me. -Whoever smelt it... ALL: Dealt it! Ha ha. Very funny. Now, let's get down to business. One of us has to show up to meet Brad tomorrow. We can't use any dragon powers. We're gonna have to face him straight up. So I'm looking for a volunteer. (WHISTLING) Aw, come on. One of us has to represent tomorrow. Now, who's it gonna be? That's what I'm talking about. My man here isn't afraid of Brad. I'm terrified of Brad. No way I'm going. But you raised your hand. To suggest that you create another doppelganger, one that's designed specifically for this task. Hm. Jake Long, I like the way you think. I know it's here somewhere. Jake, don't worry about Brad. -Trix and I totally have your back. And... -(GASPS) Ah... (YELPS) Hey, cool acorn puppet. Jakey, what is going on in here? No, look. My schedule got totally swamped, so... I brought in a little help. Hmm... How do we know that this one's the real Jake Long and not the other one? -Spud, trust me. -I could trust you or you can tell me what my favorite possession is. A ball of belly button lint you've been collecting since you were three? Ecch! That's disgusting... And also correct. So I'm choosing to believe you for now. But I'll be keeping my eye on you. I'm gonna go ahead and take a wild guess on this one. We've been double-dutching with your double, right? Yep. But you have to admit this guy has some fly moves. I jump rope, therefore I am. Oh, Jakey. This is not about winning the double-dutch tournament. This is about trust, friendship. Hey, that boy can put a hurtin' on some jump rope. Look at him go! Look, guys, I just need to make one more double of myself, one who can take the beating from Brad tomorrow. Let's see. Here we go. I just wanna say for the record, I think this is a bad idea. You should get rid of all of these Jakey clones. Ooh, except this one. He is all mine, okay? I'm keeping this one. Welcome to the world, my man. So you down with getting beaten up tomorrow? Sure. I can do that. Look, I'm sorry it had to go down this way. Just protect your face, and I promise it'll be over quickly. I promise it'll be over quickly, too. -(GRUNTS) -Hey. Boo-hoo. Jakey's probably crying to his mommy right now that he's scared of the dark. I mean... I mean the Bradster. Yo, Brad, what up? Oh, I didn't think you had the guts to show. So where do you want it? The face? The gut? Surprise me. Hm. (GROANS) (ALL GASP) Huh? Wait. What's happening? Ow. Let go! Let go! Whatever you say, Brad. (YELPS) It's dark! I'm scared. Whoa! (SCREAMING) (ALL CHEERING) (ALL CHEERING) Dude, that was so not cool. You were supposed to take a beating from Brad, not dish one out. -Oh, he deserved it. -Maybe, but that's not the point. You're my doppelganger. That means you take my orders like the rest of the dop gang. Yeah. The thing is, I'm not like the others. Huh? You're right. 'Cause you're history. I'm reabsorbing you right now. I don't think so. Dragon up. Now, let's have some fun. Whoa! I never thought I'd have to kick my own behind. But here goes. Dragon up. (BOTH GRUNTING) Whoa. I feel really weak. Ha. You feel weak to me, too. (GROANING) Kid, please tell me you're joking? Don't you get it? Every doppelganger you make sucks away part of your chi energy. That's why your gas tank is on empty. But it was working out fine. Why did this one go bad? I did it just like you told me. I reached over here, grabbed the vial. Ah, no, kid. This is a negative chi amplifier. If you made a doppelganger with this stuff, it's guaranteed to be 100% pure evil. An evil body attached to this pretty face? (SCOFFS) That's just wrong. I gotta stop it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't stand a chance in your condition. You're gonna have to reabsorb all the other doppelgangers and take back the strength they're sucking from you. So if I reabsorb them, I can take this guy out? Maybe. If it's not too late. But you can't reabsorb me. I got a bear trap to finish and a neckerchief slide to lacquer and-- DAD: Where's my little cougee scout? Let me hear you shout, shout... (YELPS) Oh, ho, ho. Someone has been working on his bear trapping patch, hasn't he? Oopsies. Lost my glasses. Hey, hey. I am seeing twosies for the price of onesie. Twosies? Surprise. -That's a cougar no-no! -No. Oh, yummy. Well, it looks like we had the same idea. I'm taking you back. Now. You'll take me back when you can catch me and beat me, which is... Oh, right. Never. So I'll just be dragoning up and taking over now. -See ya. -(DAD CHUCKLES) I don't understand a word of your teen slang jive. What's a "dragon up"? Whoa! (LAUGHS) Oh. It's on now, punk. (GRUNTS) No! Whoa! Clean-up, aisle 10. (LAUGHS) Sorry. I'm done answering to you. Can't you just name the capital of Bolivia for me? Does it hurt your head much to bring me joy? Quick. I got to get you out of here before-- Too late. (PANTING) Got to get to jump-rope Jake. You can't have him. Trix, if you don't let me have him, my evil twin is gonna destroy my rep, the magical world, and who knows what else. But, Jake, that boy's got mad skills. -End of the world here. -(WHINES) Okay. Yo. Heads up. Too bad for you, I'm so self-absorbed. No. Fu, we've got a problem. Evil Jake reabsorbed my doppelgangers before I could. Who, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. All of 'em? JAKE: Not quite all. There's still one Jake I need to reabsorb. And what Jake would that be? The original. I have ten times your chi strength and power. It would be easier not to fight me. I'm done taking the easy route. (COUGHING) Whoa. That's some negative self-image you got there. Come on. Let's get out of here. Let me go, Fu. It's time I put me in my place. Uh-huh. No way. Kid, you're not playing with a full deck, and he's got three of a kind with an ace kicker. -Huh? -You're too weak to take him on now. We better just duck and cover till Gramps gets back. No. This whole thing happened 'cause I tried to take the easy way out. That dude's got my face. He's got my powers. But there's still only one am-drag, and it's time I took care of business the hard way. Dragon up. Oh. -Whoa. -Calm down. Didn't anybody tell you I rule over all magical beings now? ORIGINAL JAKE: Just so you know, I've always been hard on myself. But don't take my word for it. Whoa. You're gonna run away again? American chicken. (GRUNTS) Ah. (CIRCUS TUNE PLAYING) Prepare to be absorbed. No! No! Release my chi energy. No magical shortcuts. Got to do it on my own. Hey, can I play, too? What? How can that-- -Now, release my doppelgangers. -(GROANS) The rope! We're free. Us three on the count of 3. One, two, three. Yeah! And last but not least... No! We showed us who's boss. That was better than a s'mores sing-along. Jumping for joy. A-plus. Guys, I got mad love for how you had my back. But from now on, this drag is going stag. Are you sure? Yeah. The thing is, I got to find a way to handle my own business, you know, without shortcuts... or lies. So you guys got to go. -Thanks for the help, Trixie. -It's the least I could do, with all the time you're putting in the double-dutch tournament. Now, let's go ace those mid-midterms. (DIALING) I'm proud of you, Jake Long. By prioritizing your schedule and calling in some help, you have achieved time management perfection. (HIP-HOP TUNE PLAYING) Jake, aren't you supposed to be watching Haley? Don't worry. I called in a favor. Huh? FU: Can you believe how Olivia Meers busted her Patty party doll beach-time convertible and then blamed it on poor Chelsea Fudderman? (GASPS) The nerve. SPUD: If you ask me, Jake gave up on the magical chi doppleganger thing way too soon. I mean, how cool would it be to doppelgang yourself? Could you imagine the possibilities of having two Spuds? Or why not three Spuds? Or four? Five Spuds. 6 Spuds. Seven, eight, nine, 10. Think what the combined power of an armada of identical spuddelgangers could do. Wow. What wonders this world would behold.
