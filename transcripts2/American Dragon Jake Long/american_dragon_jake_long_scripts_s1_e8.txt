 Aw, man. (BELL RINGS) Yo. This is some seriously messed up homework assignment. For real. What's the point in making us carry around a stupid egg for the weekend? Stupid? Dude, don't talk about our baby like that. This is gonna teach all of us to become nurturing caregivers. Ha ha. I think I'm gonna name him Smiley. When he grows up, I want him to be just like me. Uh, Spud, I hate to bust your bubble, baby, But when he grows up, he's gonna be an omelet. Let me see him. Delivery for Jake Long. Sign here. Jake, come to Grandpa's shop. There is a critical dragon emergency. I gotta jet, guys. Do me a favor and watch the egg for me until I get back. You're always working. What about some quality time with our child? You're tearing this family apart! Sorry, guys. The American Dragon has more important things to do than guard an egg. Egg? You want me to guard an egg? Not just any egg. A griffin egg. A grif... What? A griffin is a magical creature with the body of a lion and the wings and head of an eagle. It lays an egg only once every thousand years. So it's a pretty big deal. And because griffin eggs are so rare, there's a lot of undesirables who'd love to get their hands on one. Jake, it is imperative that you guard the egg until it hatches. No prob, G. Yo. Where's this griffin at anyway? Whoa! That's long way down. Hey, at least you got wings, kid. (SQUAWKS) Hey, hey, hey, hey. No worries. The Am-Drag's in the hiz-ouse! Dragon up! Ain't nobody even gonna think about messing with your... (SQUAWKS) Egg? The egg is ours. Come on, kid. We gotta go get that egg poacher. Ha ha. Get it? Poached? Egg? With the... Oh, forget it. Don't worry about your egg. I'm all over this. Let's fly. It's beautiful. More importantly, it's valuable. -One problem. -What? Argh! It's not yours. Argh! Hyah! (GRUNTS) Wha! -Hey! -Got it. I got it. -I don't got it. -The egg! Oh, so that's how they make egg drop soup, huh? (CHUCKLES) Get it? Egg? Drop? All right. Start looking, kid. We gotta get that egg back to its mom before it hatches. All right. All right. All right. Let's see. Ball... Ball... Ball... Ball... Ball. Ball... Egg! HUNTSGIRL: An egg? For me? You shouldn't have, but I'll take it anyway. Hands over, dragon boy. You know, I like a girl who knows what she wants. Too bad you're not getting it. Dive! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! (BOTH GRUNTING) Ahhh! BOTH: Whoa! Excuse me, ma'am, but the ball bed is only for children age six and under. Can it, pipsqueak! Whoa! Ow! JAKE: Whoa! FU: Hey! I know you're in here, dragon. (PANTING) We better hide here for a while. (HUMMING LA MARSEILLAISE) Monsieur, the food critic is here. Non. C'est incroyable. She just ordered the cheese omelet. (FRENCH ACCENT) Then I must make the finest Omelette au fromage in all of culinary history. Hmm. I simply will... Oh! I'm out of the egg. Sacré bleu! An egg! C'est un miracle! Uh, adios, señor. Uh! Whoa! (CHEF SPEAKING FRENCH) WOMAN: Ahhh! Whoa! Run! Halt, you little... Oh! Huh? Come back immediately! (PANTING) (PANTING) Sacré bleu! Hey, you're not in an animal costume, And you're costume reeks, man. Don't you ever dry clean that thing? Hey. I had a bath just the other month. Why, I ought to... (PUNCHING) Whoa! The egg! (BOTH PANTING) Whoa! Uh! Whoo! Well, here's the egg. Wait. This is purple. Hey... There are eggs all over the place. There it is! (GRUNTS) Lookee! Pretty! Hey, uh, little girl, would you mind giving me that egg? -Please? -No! My egg! Mine! I finded it, doofus! Yeah, but see, it's really, really important that I... (CRIES) Hey! (CRIES) Mommy! Mommy! The mean boy stolded my egg! That punk stole my little girl's egg. MAN: Let's get it back! WOMAN: Let's get him. Dragon up! MAN 1: Where'd he go? MAN 2: Well, he was right here. Whew. That was close. I think that there... Hey, look out! Ahhh! (BOTH GRUNTS) What is this brown stuff? (SNIFFS) Smells kinda funky. It tastes like... Peanut butter. BOTH: Whoa! Oh, man, this sure is turning into one egg-hausting day. (LAUGHS) Man, they just keep coming, with the eggs and the thing... Oh, forget it. (SIGHS) At least the egg is safe. Hey! (LAUGHS EVILLY) Mine at last. And now, dragon, I shall destroy you. -(GRUNTS) -Whoa! Ahhh! -The egg! -After it! Yo. Good luck finding that egg now. HUNTSGIRL: Dragon! -You will pay for this. -(BOTH GRUNT) -Uh-oh. -Oh, this ain't gonna be pretty. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn HUNTSMAN: Find the egg! BOTH: Ahhh! (BOTH GRUNT) I am never eating peanut butter again. JAKE: Oh, yes you are. We're gonna have to unwrap every one of these and lick the peanut butter off. It's the only way to find the egg. Are you goofy, Jake? There's millions of 'em. Then we better get started. -Egg number one. -Oh, boy. -(FU GROANS) -Egg number 8,032. Ugh. Peanut better again. (GROANS) Too much... Peanut butter. (GROANS) 8,033. Ugh! The griffin egg! Ah. Hip... Hip... (BELCHES) Hooray. (GROANS) We better get back to the nest. (GROANS) To the Empire State Building! Come on. Come on. (GRUNTS) How much, uh, longer? -(GRUNTS) -Hyah! At last, the griffin egg that will... Argh! This time I got it. This time I got it. This time... I don't got it. Do you think Smiley's safe in my backpack? Maybe we should invest in a baby stroller. Okay. Imagine your stamina... No! The egg! We're too late, kid. It's sunnyside up. The egg is scrambled, Master. It's a poor thing. Back to home sled. Oh. It's my fault. Oh. He never even got a chance to get out of his shell. The poor... Hey! That's no magical griffin egg. -It's Smiley. -Smiley? What's that supposed to mean? Well, for one it means I'm gonna flunk Home Economics this semester. But more importantly, we gotta find Spud and Trixie. SPUD AND TRIXIE: Yay! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! TRIXIE: Yeah, baby. Next! Ha ha! SPUD: Toss Smiley over here. I want to show him a trick. Trixie! Spud! No! (GRUNTS) (SIGHS IN RELIEF) Oh, sure. Now you want to take an interest in our family. Here it is. Safe and sound. (SQUAWKS) And just in time, kid. Check out the egg. You're about to witness one of the miracles of the magical world. (SQUAWKS) You know what, Fu? Being the American Dragon is a rough job, but it's times like this that make it all worth... (GULPS AND BELCHES) Hey... No... What the... Wha... The griffin just ate the... But... But I thought we... Yo. That's gotta be the most messed up thing I've ever seen in my life. Relax, kid. The griffin baby's fine. It just has to live inside the mother's digestive track for a week or two after it hatches. Then the mom throws it back up. (BABY GRIFFIN SQUAWKS) Ain't it beautiful? I think I'm gonna hurl. Well, time to make our eggs-it. Mission egg-complished. That's all, yolks. (LAUGHS) JAKE: Uh, Fu, about those egg puns, never again, huh? Sheesh. Sue a dog for having a little fun. ♪ American Dragon ♪ ♪ American Dragon ♪ Ahhh! (CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) (LAUGHS) Huh? (GASPS) (GASPS) The gold! Oh, what happened? Oh, it's gone! It's gone! Oh! Your move, Jake. Okay. Uh... Check this. (SIGHS) Checkmate. Huh? TRIXIE: Hey, yo, Jake. I hate to tear you away from your big game, but we gotta roll out. Ready to go half pipe? What do you say, Grandpa? Can I go? We've been playing this boring game for three hours. Sharpening the mind is never wasteful. Life is a mental game, Jake. You must always stay three steps ahead of your opponent. (IRISH ACCENT) There you are! Oh, for the love of clover, I've been looking all over for ya! He's got our gold! All of it! -Who? -FU: Pandarus. Eli Excelsior Pandarus. Millionaire, jet-setting playboy... (CROWD CHEERING) Animal lover. Otherwise know as the "Wizard of Wall Street." Do you mean, like, because he's made millions at the stock market or... No, I mean, like, because he's a dark wizard. Keep it up, kid, and lay off the sugar. I cased this place this morning. Pandarus Tower. Ninety-seven floors. Five million square feet, and as of yesterday, home to gross of stolen leprechaun gold. Truth is, it's not four-leaf clovers that give leprechauns luck. It's this here gold, and without it, the little green suckers don't have a chance. Wow. Are you hearing this? I know, right? I just can't get used to the whole talking dog thing. I mean, I see his mouth moving. I hear the sounds coming out, -but it just don't seem right. -Ahem! Look, kids, I know you're new to this whole magical world thing here, but I'm here to tell you it ain't all fairy wings and forest nymphs. Now, lucky for the leprechauns, I got an elfin... Ahem... Uh, lady friend on the inside who slipped me the lowdown on the layout. This here's the granddaddy of all vaults. The vault is reinforced with unicorn horns, strongest substance on earth. Inside the vault are motion detector beams made of pixie dust, and on the other side of that, the gold. Ha ha, this is where you come in kid. Or, rather, this is where you come in, dragon. No sweat, Fu. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! I'm all over it. Huh? Uh... Ha. All right, after me and the kid nab the gold, there's a dumbwaiter that takes us up from the vault, into the kitchen. That's where we need you two. No matter what goes down, I need you guys to be in the kitchen when Jake comes up with the gold. You got it? Come on, man, all this planning and plotting. Let me just lay a little dragon pizazzle on 'em. I'll go in, I'll go out. That wizard won't know what hit him. I'm afraid not, young one. This one's a mental game, remember, a cool head cools the body. Hit the pedal, Gretel! I'm not getting any younger! (SPEAKING CHINESE) FU: Uh... Uh... I knew I should've worn my girdle! I'm telling you, Gramps, this sneaking around is a waste of time. I could just bust in and take 'em down, yo! We must not draw attention to ourselves! The walls have eyes. FU: (VOICE MUFFLED) Come on, hurry it up, will ya? It's a little cramped in here! That's more like it. Ouch. JAKE: Hey! Whoa! Watch it. And you are? Hello, dude. We're here for the gol... Ow! Golden opportunity to let you hear us. Peak game, player! We the best lounge act you've never seen. You lucky we even playin' in this dump! You understand me? Loud and clear. I look forward to hearing more. -Huh? -(FU MUTTERING) Uh, hold up, dude. My bad, yo. We forgot. Oh, your bad? Heh, it's my bad I had that extra chili on that hotdog. Mr. Pandarus is waiting. Get onstage! What? But we're not... TRIXIE: Yo, hands off the 'fit, lady! Let's do this, kid. Uh, mic check, one, two, three. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, and a huh... -(FEEDBACK SQUEALS) -(GROANS) Quiet! I've tapped into the security eyes. You're directly over the vault. Have you located the trap door yet? Where's the ladder? Dragon wings, Jake. Right, right, wings! I knew that. Dragon up! Dude, this isn't part of the plan. We gotta get to the kitchen. (BOTH LAUGHING NERVOUSLY) Right, just follow my lead. -(MUSIC PLAYS) -MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the Pandarus Lounge the smooth sounds of Trix-a-licious. Whassup, New York? Y'all out there like love songs as much as we do? Yeah! You better hug your mothers, 'cause you're goin' down, mudbucket! Mudbucket, buckets of mud! Yeah! (CRASHES) (GRUNTS) -(GRUNTS) -And Conga. (CONGA MUSIC PLAYING) TRIXIE: Now, head for the kitchen! Get me whoever's in charge of booking musical acts. Sow down there, kid. This hotdog ain't so good the second time around, you know what I mean? JAKE: Whoa! -(BELCHES) -Oh! The vault! Welcome, Mr. Pandarus. Please provide handprint scan now. Huh? I don't understand. This wasn't in any of the plans I got. Hey, no problem. I've been waiting for some real action, anyway. Yo, just stand back, Fu. (GRUNTS) Oh! Glad you got that out of your system. Now, you heard Skeletonia. Only Pandarus's handprint will open that safe. Wait a minute. Magical fur. Works every time. -SKELETON: Thank you, Mr. Pandarus. -(CLICKS) Hey, yo, Pandarus wants two private chefs -up in his penthouse right away. -(GASPS) Mmm. Piece of cake. This is your moment. Just like a chess game, one move at a time. You must use your tail to slowly navigate each beam to... Jake! JAKE: Hey, sorry, Gramps. -I just thought I'd try my way. -Ahhh! Real smooth like. Ahhh! Oh... -(ALARM BLARING) -Oops. My bad. Ahhh! If you didn't book them, how did they get in here? (ALARM BLARES) Unleash the Kumo. Oh! Pandarus is onto us! Get out of there! BOTH: Huh? -(WATCH BEEPING) -Dude, we did it! Jake should be up here in 30 seconds. And... What are you two standing around for? We need that stew! Uh, stew? Stew! What are you, new? You know what to do. Make some... Stew? So true. I'll be back in two. And I want that stew. Yo, that was freaky. Yo, Gramps, where is Jake? We gotta roll. They're trying to get us to cook. Then cook already! Just don't leave the kitchen. Jake has been minorly detained. Eh, leave it to the old Wizard of Wall Street to unleash the Kumo. (HISSING) Oh! Whoa! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! (GRUNTS) Huh? Now, that's what I call armed and dangerous! Hyah! Ha ha! Can't do that, can you? -Hyah! -(HISSING) That's right, come to Papa. -Let's get outta here. -Heard that. Aw, that kumo don't quit! (SCOFFS) Send in full security. I'm not about to let a dragon and his dog steal my stolen leprechaun gold. Needs a little salt. FU: Forget the stew, get us out of here! GUARD: Hurry! They're in the kitchen. Pandarus! (GRUNTS) Well, well... What do we have here? Huh? Ew. Do you honestly think you can outwit the Wizard of Wall Street? -Take them away! -(GROWLING) -(BRAKES SCREECH) -Get in! (GRUNTS) Seatbelts, everyone. (TIRES SQUEAL) It will be much harder to get to Pandarus now, but we must devise a new plan. The leprechauns are counting on us. Yo, times like this, the only thing to make you feel better is a little blues. See what I'm sayin'? How 'bout a little sax solo, Spud? Well, I've never actually trained, but... Whoa! Checkmate. Just like you taught me, Gramps. JAKE: Always stay three steps ahead of your opponent. Wait a minute. If we have the gold, then Pandarus has the... PANDARUS: Stew? What the... (SLURPS) Needs a little salt. Oh... You're fired! All of you... Fired! (THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
