 (GRUNTS) (HEAVES) You call that a block? Oh, my grandmother could take that guy out, and she's 1,400 years old! Hey, hey! I'm only 1,392! Down in front, Grandma, huh? (GRANDMA GROANS) -(GRUNTS) -(GROANS) (CHEERING) So anyway, if the rushing ogre clips the left winger,

 he gets six free throws and... Incoming! Whoa! Whoa. Does anyone ever get hit by those things? Kid, come on. This game is about team-building and sportsmanship, not violence and... -(OGRE GROANS) -Oh! Oh! Fight! Fight! (OGRES GRUNTING) (GRANDMA GRUNTING) Take this, you... Tempers are high. See, the winner of this game goes on to the Ogre Bowl, the grand-daddy of all boulder ball games. Guard your grill, Grandma! (BUZZER SOUNDS)

 Whoo! And that was just the first period. How many periods are there? Well, let's see. Uh, we're playing winter rules, so... Only 17. Huh? Can you believe it? Quadruple overtime! Aw, this is history, kid. Maybe it'll end in a tie. (SNORING) (SPUTTERS) Amateur. (SNORING CONTINUES) Mr. Long! -Ogre foul! -Nein! (GERMAN ACCENT) The correct answer is cyclops. Mr. Long, Friday's test counts for you know what? 50% of your grade, so, if you don't shape up by then, you will get the distinct pleasure of seeing me, Professor Rotwood, in the Bermuda shorts with the flippy-floppy sandals. Meaning? Summer school! Aw, man.

GRANDPA: Jake! Get back to work! Aw, man. (GONG SOUNDS) Uh-uh. Come on, Fu! Just a little memory potion to get me by until after I pass the test. Oh, Jake. Cutting one corner just leads to two more. Uh, you just cut up my homework. The scissors of life may cut you many things, But... Hi-ya! Do not question your Dragon Master! I have an important mission for you. Hi, Jake! Remember us? You will! Oh, yeah. The Oracle Twins. So are you the one that only sees the good stuff or the bad stuff? You're gonna get a nasty case of poison ivy all over your head in July. A pox upon your face! (GIGGLES) Right. Bad stuff. Well, then, that must make you the one who sees all the good stuff. What's up? You're cavity-free this year. -Yeah! -Root canal next year! Aw. Jake, the Oracle Twins are in grave danger. Someone is after them. Herbert! What does a goblin crime boss want with the Oracle Twins? He plans to capture the twins and force them to make predictions on the outcome of the Ogre Bowl. (GASPS) Using a magical gift to try and turn a profit! Will those goblins stop at nothing? Check out the centaur racing page. Anything jump out at you? Anything? Throw me a bone, will ya, huh? (GRANDPA CLEARS THROAT) I'm a bad dog. (WHISPERS) We'll talk later. Jake, as the American Dragon, you must protect the Oracle Twins until after the Ogre Bowl. Yo, Gramps, I'm all over it. How about I pick y'all up on Friday after my mythology test? No! The Ogre Bowl is Friday. -(STAMMERS) But I... -Sorry, young one. But you must find a way to balance your school work and your dragon duties. Thanks for your help. And, uh, don't slip on the newt eyeballs! Newt eyeballs? What newt eyeballs? Whoa! Ew! Talk about rolling your eyes! (LAUGHS HEARTILY) I got a million of 'em. Yo, if you ladies can see everything, can't you just see when Herbert's coming and make a run for it? Ugh. We can't see everything, Einstein. Hmm. They may be descendants of the Oracle of Delphi, but the bloodline's thin after a couple thousand years. I just get visions... Horrible, disturbing visions that haunt my every waking moment. Not to mention my nightmares. Mine always seem to have cinnamon rainbows and gingham puppies in them. I hate puppies. Oh, I hear you, Sister. The chewing, the yapping, the carpet stains... Aw, blech. I knew it. We've been replaced. It was only a matter of time until you got cuter sidekicks. Speak for yourself, Spud. Yo, I told you, they're not my sidekicks. They're my job. I have to bodyguard them. We're posing as his cousins from out of town. I forgive you for spitting soda all over me. (GIGGLES) What? Ain't nobody spit! (CLEARS THROAT) You didn't yet. Kara and Sarah see flashes of the future. Kara sees good stuff. Sarah sees bad stuff. Quit playin'! Okay, okay. What do y'all see about me? Come on, come on, hook Mama Trixie up with a little something something. You and yo-yo boy are gonna tie the knot. Boring. (SPEWS) What the... Huh? Yo, that's impossible. I'm tying the knot with Denzel. You and Den... What? Why didn't I get an invitation? I knew it! It was only a matter of time before you replaced me with a cuter sidekick. (PANTING) I smell them approaching, boss. (SNIFFING) Let's take them. Not now. We must wait until they're alone. Are you two... Ready? Blend in with them at school. Watch their every move. The Ogre Bowl is this Friday. We don't have much time. JAKE: Okay, here's the drill. Tomorrow at 2:00 p.m., I have, like, the most important test of my life, so from now until then, my one and only focus will be... Rose! What's up? Oh, hey, Jake. Nice to meet ya. Tomorrow you're gonna get a massive zit on your... Yo, a little advice... People in the human realm aren't used to oracles going around predicting stuff. So just... Yo, just chill. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, uh-huh. Someone's gonna steal your pudding. (SIGHS) Not again. Guys, please! Ix-nay on the isions-vays! You... You're gonna be a Broadway star one day. I can't hide it any longer! I gotta dance, and I don't care who knows it! Attitude. Jazz hands! And I'm off! Fosse, Fosse, Fosse, Fosse. (GRUFF VOICE) Hey, watch it! (COUGHS) Ahem. (HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Uh, I mean... I was all, Bobby likes me and not you! And she was all, nuh-uh! And I was all, uh-huh! We can't help it, Jake. The visions just come to us. And then we have to blurt them out. Sorry about your nasty break-up next spring. And on prom night, too! (WHISPERS) Bring cab fare. -Hey! -It's physically impossible for us not to say them. Just like it's physically impossible for me to touch my tongue to my nose. You see? (GRUNTING) Okay, fine. But maybe you can just sugar coat it a little. (GRUNTS) Also impossible. We can't lie. Every vision we foretell is 100% true and certain to happen. (GRUNTING) Oh, no, no! It can't be true! I am not tying the knot with that! (GRUNTING) Ow! Please! Please, tell me you've been wrong once. Just once! Work with me! Um, yeah, the inside of my nose tastes different than I thought it would. It was kind of like chicken. (SOBBING) Oh, God. All right, Spud. Hit me. Forest nymph. No. According to Rotwood, it's a pixie. What? I was totally wrong. It's no wonder why I'm failing his class. Yo, what about this? Say if one of your vision thingies didn't come true, then that would prove that we have control over our own destinies. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Right. It's like Shakespeare once wrote... "It is not in the stars to hold our destiny, "but in ourselves." I try to hold my destiny, but I've got a really small bladder. Look, our visions always come true. And Spud is totally gonna spill chocolate milk in approximately 30 seconds. Oh, yeah? Well, here's where your visions are going down! Yeah! Right on, Spud. That's what's up. That's right, baby. Where are you going? You see? No chocolate milk anywhere near me. Whoa! Ow! Ahhh! (TIRES SCREECHING) Oh... Wow. Your predictions, like, always come true. Honey, I think we should honeymoon in Bora-Bora. (WHIMPERING) No. Denzel... Denzel... Denzel... The sooner we get back to Gramp's shop, the sooner I get some studying in. Come on. Short cut. Um, chain link fences and sandals don't really go together, Jake. Whoa! Oh! (CHUCKLES) I should have seen that coming. (GIGGLES) Why is that funny? You just lost your shoe. That's not a good thing. You know what is a good thing? Ice cream! I mean, seriously, yum, right? What? Ice cream? I don't get y'all. It's like you only foresee horrible, rotten stuff, but you're always in a good mood. And your life is nothing but butterflies and gum drops, but you're always mad about something. What's the deal? When you only see good things, nothing is special anymore. All the pleasant surprises are taken out of life. But when you see only bad stuff, even the smallest bit of good news makes you happy! Dang. I guess I never thought of it that way. Life's too short to let a little bad news stop you from living. Ooh, speaking of bad news, goblins are gonna fall from the sky! I bet that will be exciting. Nice work. Seize them! (GOBLINS LAUGHING) (VOICE ECHOING) Dragon up! (GRUNTS) (GOBLINS GRUNTING AND GROANING) (GOBLINS SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) Ha! Look out, now! Time to take out the trash! Ha! Whoo! Ha! Ha! Put a lid on it, yo! (BOTH GRUNTING) Get him! Hey, you goblins don't quit! Ooh! This entire alley is gonna be awash with rotten fish. Pee-ew! Fish! That's it! (GRUNTS) Sniff it up, goblins! -(ALL GROANING) -The stench! It's awful! It's awful! It pains me! Curse my sensitive nose! Thanks for saving us. And for dragging us down a dark alley where we were sitting ducks! Hey, thanks for hooking me up in that fish tip. I couldn't have beat the goblins without it. I just call 'em like I see 'em. Speaking of seeing, congratulations, genius. You're gonna get number four right on your mythology test. (BLOWS RASPBERRY) Argonauts. Those guys were totally overrated, if you ask me. Uh, did you just have a vision about the right answers to my mythology test? Looks that way. (CHUCKLES) I'd kiss you if I didn't think you'd slap the living daylights out of me. Ooh, good call. I like kisses! Okay, okay. Just clear your mind and give me some more visions from the test. It's tomorrow, 2:00. Jake, we can't ask for visions to come. They just do. Oh! Spud's gonna get number 12 wrong. -What does he answer? -True. Awesome! Four is argonaut. Twelve is false. Keep 'em coming. And while you're at it, any thoughts on the Ogre Bowl? Papa needs a new pair of shoes. Well, they're not real shoes. They're like paw socks. They protect your pads. Fu! Don't distract them! Okay, let's talk about the essay section. How's it going in here? BOTH: Great! Ah, just practicing my paper training. Ha. Oh! Talk about your yellow journalism. (IMITATES RIMSHOT, CHUCKLES) Whoa. (GIGGLES) We're just helping Jake cheat on his mythology test! What? No, no, not cheat. We... We... It was... Uh... Jake, remember, the easy way is not always the best way. When you cut corners... Ah! I... I know! Ah! I know! Yo, Mr. Rot! Nein! Professor! Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just wanted to tell you that... (RAPPING) ♪ I'm looking forward to your test today ♪ ♪ But you might have to invent A grade higher than an A ♪ Hop! (BEAT BOXING) Holla! (GRUFF VOICE) The Ogre Bowl is this afternoon. We have to get those twins. (CLEARS THROAT, HIGH-PITCHED) Uh, what are you looking at, Sister? You think you're all that? That's right, keep walking, honey. Bobby's mine, you hear me? Mine! Whew. Thanks again for the tip about that skunked meat loaf. My pleasure! Look, I'm just saying, you know onions give you heartburn. It's my life, woman! Oh, oh, it's your life? Well, what about the life that we're supposed to be building together? What about little Shaniqua and Denzelina? I'm supposed to tell them that daddy can't take them to Gym-O-Rama because he's burping up onions. (SIGHS) Thank you very much. I appreciate that. (GASPS) That Rose girl! What? What's up? Is she okay? Did she go for the meat loaf? No, but someone's gonna take the last pudding before she gets it. Oh, are they? -My pudding! -Here. This is better for you, anyway. (SIGHS) You're right. (CLEARS THROAT) Puddin', m'lady? You got me the last one. Yo. (CHUCKLES) That's what friends are for. Okay, wait a minute. You said someone else was gonna take the last pudding. Hello, someone did. Jake. Yeah, but... But if you hadn't have... And then he wouldn't have... Then you... Huh? My head hurts. Our visions always come true, just not always in the way you expect. Now's our chance. Quick... Before Dragon Boy comes. What? She digs me. (CRASHES) (GRUFF VOICE) Curses. (HIGH-PITCHED) And like, you know Bobby will totally dump Shelley as soon as her roots show. Dye job, much? Yo, I think we're totally onto something with this Rose thing. So after we take the mythology test, maybe we can go and vision some stuff about her. Pixie schnitzel! That's what I'm talking about, some... What in the heck is a pixie schnitzel? I just got a strong vision of us smelling pixie schnitzel. Oh! And Rose is totally gonna trip down stairs in, like, 30 seconds. Yo! I'm on it! Whoa! Oh. Watch your step, there. Whoo. You always seem to be at the right place at the right time these days. Speaking of the right time... (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) (CLEARS THROAT) I, uh... Thanks for the pudding. Care to join us for the test, Mr. Long? Uh, I, uh... My... My cousins are supposed to sit... Whoa! (BUZZING) Hey, hey! Watch it! Uh, this is sort of a bad time. You're telling me. Wait until you hear this message from the Oracle Twins. The bad news is we're gonna get nabbed by Herbert! (GIGGLES) The good news is, you're gonna rescue us. My hero. The bad news is you're gonna get hit by a boulder going 180 miles per hour. Wow! That's gonna hurt! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn Here. Gotta go to the bathroom. You realize that if you leave, -you will fail this test. -(DOOR OPENS) Ah. Must have been the meat loaf. Kara! Sarah! Hey, everybody, the Bronx Droolers and the Jersey Knuckle-Draggers have been tossing boulders at each other for years. (CHUCKLES) Hey, maybe they should just throw around J.T.'s big bald head! -Everybody come on! -Kid, you're just in time! We gotta get over to Madison Square... Wait! Jake, where are the Oracle Twins? (INHALES) Well... GRANDPA: Herbert never misses the Ogre Bowl. I am sure the twins are in there somewhere. Closed for renovations? Code for secret magical event inside. Trust me. By the time the Ogre Bowl is over, they'll need to renovate. (CROWD CHEERING) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) Yeah! Aw, we're never gonna find them in this place. -(BUZZER SOUNDS) -They could be anywhere. Pixie schnitzel. Kid, now is not the time to be thinking about that delicious, steaming fresh schnitzel that the pixies serve with the little sprinkles and the... Okay, just a quick one. No! Pixie schnitzel. Sarah had a vision of them smelling it. There! GOBLIN: Come on. Yum. Tell us who's gonna win the game, and you'll get all the pixie schnitzel your heart desires. Great. Thanks. (SPLATS) (HIGH-PITCHED) Okay, like, sorry, rude girl. I don't know who you think you are, -but... -Frank, it's over. You're not in school anymore. You'll regret going out with Shelley! You hear me, Bobby? Beauty is only skin deep! -Skin deep! -(DOOR OPENS) That's enough! -(DOOR CLOSES) -It's not too late for some serious half-time bets, so you ladies better start foreseeing some Ogre Bowl action or else. Or else what, Herbie? Just let the twins... (GRUNTING) -Go. -Never! I'm going to make a gold mine off these oracles. (GRUNTS) Ahhh! (THUDS) -(CRASHING) -They're not just oracles. They're people, and you can't just use them for your own selfish reasons. Oh, speaking of that, how's Rose? She's great, thanks. Wait, wait. I didn't use... I mean, I didn't use... I mean... Enough chitter chatter. It's time to play some halftime action. (BOTH GASP) (BOTH SCREAMING) -Fu! Let's go! -(MUFFLED) Huh? (PANTING) (BUZZER SOUNDS) Hey, those boulders are really picking up speed now! Some of them have been clocked at over 180 miles per hour. J.T., I'm scared. What are you? Wait. 180 miles per hour... If I go out there, I'll... Jake! Here goes nothing. Dragon on the field! Dragon on the field! (GRUNTING) Ha! What's your hurry, Herbie? Kid, behind you! Huh? Oh, gosh! (GRUNTS) Say what? (ALL SHOUTING) Jake! Oh, talk to me. Oh... I gotta get out of here. I'm gonna get hit by a boulder going 180 miles per hour! (LAUGHS HEARTILY) Already happened, kid. Hey, can I get a little help over here? Let's take a look at that last play. The boulder here was going 180 miles per hour, but Jake was flying at a cruising speed of 179. That makes the relative speed of the boulder a mere one mile an hour, nothing but a harmless tap. (CHUCKLING) Now, if it was J.T.'s big bald head that hit ya, that would have been another story, right, J.T.? 'Cause that's a rock. That's a big, hard... All right, smarty pants, take a walk. Thanks for saving us! I knew you would. I believe this is yours. I'll take that. Hey! Hey! Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop! That's the thanks I get for saving your life? Well, if you hadn't abandoned us in the hallway, you wouldn't have had to save our lives in the first place... Not that we don't totally appreciate it! I'm just saying you could have called. I kept dinner warm for you all night. Yo, whatever. I ate dinner at home. You always eat dinner at home! We need to communicate if we want this thing to work! Hold up. I gotta tie my shoe. Does the rabbit go through the hole or under the hole? (GROANS) Give me that! We're tying this thing in a knot once and for all. (CHUCKLES) Trix! Huh. We tied the knot. The prediction! That's what Oracle Girl was talking about. Ha! We tied the knot! You mean we don't have to... The wedding is off, dudette! -(HUMMING A TUNE) -Hear that, ladies of NYC? Spud is once again a free man! Mmm. Denzel, honey... You keep the light on for Mama Trixie, okay? Does that mean we don't get to go to Bora-Bora? So, uh, I guess I wasn't the best bodyguard, huh? Well, you did give up your test to save us. Oh, speaking of the test... Yes! Good news, I passed! Actually, everyone's gonna have to take a whole new test. Something involving bad meat loaf. Ugh. You'll find out tomorrow. Listen, we owe you one. If you want, we can hang out and see if any visions from the new test hit us. Thanks, but no more shortcuts. I think I'll take care of this one myself. Well, thanks for risking your life to save us, knowing you were gonna get hit by that boulder and everything. Hey! Life's too short to let a little bad news keep you from living. -Right? -That's a super duper attitude! You should keep that in mind when you find out the dark, awful truth about Rose. Well... (GIGGLES) Night! What? What... What... What truth? Hey, guys! Guys! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
