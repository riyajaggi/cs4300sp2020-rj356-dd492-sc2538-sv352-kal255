 Previously on Royal Pains... Chief investigator of the clinical trial agreed I would be able to travel... If there is continuity of care. Aha. Our marriage has been on hold since that crazy night it first began. We'll take the time we need to work through this. And then we need to focus on us... We need to go to marriage counseling. On our honeymoon.

 Marriage counseling. You'll be on bed rest... No going to work, no going anywhere that's farther than the fridge. You'll need help. - Are you two...? - No, we're just friends, and I'll be taking care of her. Jeremiah, what if you could return to Hankmed and not work with me at all. How would that be possible? You would be in charge. Just out of curiosity, does your offer still stand? I would need a full commitment. How long till we leave? How fast can you pack?

 Young man, where is Divya? Uh, which one is she, the Indian one? I have another one of these in an hour. You double-booked puja ceremonies? Pujas don't pay as much as weddings. I have to overcommit to cover my nuts. I think it's "nut." I'll track her down for you. Inappropriate for this setting? Mmm. - Highly inappropriate. - Oh. But I hear there's a dozen empty bedrooms upstairs. - Oh, really? - Quiet, private. In fact, some of them probably haven't seen action in years. Well, I feel really bad for those rooms, uh... More so for myself, actually, 'cause I need to find Divya right now. I'll assume that's an unrelated matter. Highly unrelated. - Have you seen her? - No. No, good call. Where is he at? Ah. So when was the last time Divya spoke to the father? Oh, I-I'm not sure. We're just good friends... And roommates and, uh... But I don't know all the details of her life. Do you know where Divya is? Oh, yes, I do. Here, follow me. Sashi, your blouse is blue, just like that sky up there. - Hey, you two. - Hey. What are you doing way over here? I'm hiding from the army of random Hampton notables my father has invited. Who has ever heard of hiring a P.R. firm for a puja ceremony? Who ever heard of a puja ceremony? Your dad is so excited to be a grandpa. He's excited to be the center of attention for a change. Hmm, well, you, Divya, need to keep up with today's schedule. It's time to start already? Yeah, your pundit has summoned you. All we're missing now is Hank. Evan, you know that Hank RSVP'd "maybe." When did "maybe" become the new "no," guys? Come on. Well, Rafa declined the old-fashioned way. He just said, "decline." - Oh. - Did he give a reason? Uh, his latest stalker. The police are after her, and he didn't want to attract any craziness to the puja. Mm-hmm. All right, giddy up. Hey, babe, listen, um, I know you miss Hank, But do you think you might be projecting? What do you mean? I just don't want to see you get hurt, like last time. Hey guys, we don't need to find a new doctor for the summer, okay? Hank will be back. Evan, you're being unrealistic. Boris' clinical trial won't even end until August. Why don't I pull some resumes, just in case? That sounds like a fair compromise. - Agreed. - I'm really proud of the way you just stepped outside of yourself. Okay, so, Jeremiah, that covers personnel. Good. What's next? Next, you guys discuss outstanding follow-ups while I continue making headbands - for the Valentine's Day party. - You know what? - I will help you. - Oh, good. How... oh, my goodness. How am I gonna help you? Um, what do you think of this one? You're like a headband savant. We got another call from Mrs. Abovsky. Her abdominal discomfort hasn't abated. Let's move her up in the schedule. She's complaining of nausea, cramps, sharp pains... - We're acting out symptoms now? - No. No, I'm... I'm having a contraction. - Oh my God. - Oh! Ho ho. Oh. Oh. And now the father of the mother will address all those congregated here. Rubina and I have the distinct honor of informing you that Divya's daughter has been named Sashi after her grandmother, my beloved mother. It has taken 30 years, but Divya has finally embraced her heritage. Divya beti, I'm so proud of you, as are all of us here. Hello? Hello? Anyone home? You embraced your heritage? Well, I realized the importance of having a legacy to pass down to my child like that bottle of gripe water. Exactly, though medically speaking, I would never use that stuff on my baby. My mother used it to soothe my stomach when I was little, so I carry it around everywhere as a token of family tradition. - You forgot the gripe water. - Yes. Oh, it's your phone again. Is everything okay? No. Rafa says that his stalker may be in the Hamptons. He wants me to alert Shadow Pond security. I'll alert security and then fetch the gripe water. Thank you, Jeremiah. Hello. Hi. Should I just leave my present here? Oh, yes. Divya's looking forward to opening them after the party. I had no idea that Divya had such a nice place. Oh, no... this is the Lawson residence. Divya's just throwing the party here. Oh, so the party's still going on? Technically, it hasn't started yet. They're doing the ceremony now. I'm Jeremiah. I'm Emma. - Oh. - I'm a friend of Divya's. Oh. Well, I'm just grabbing something for the baby, - then I can show you to her. - Great. Wow. That is the biggest house I have ever seen. At 109,000 square feet, it's the biggest house most people have ever seen. Uh, well, I have to get this to Divya. I'll see you inside. I am sure it was just an RSVP mix-up. I'm sorry. I don't even see you on the invitee list. Hi, Liz. - Hi. - Hi. I don't believe that we've met. I'm Divya. Oh, hi. I'm Emma. Hi, Emma. And you are? - I'm a friend of Jeremiah's. - Really? A friend of Jeremiah's? Yeah, um, a family friend. Oh. I'll escort her in, guys. Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh, uh, there's Jeremiah. I should go say hello to him. Okay. How nice that he invited someone. Yeah. I hope you enjoy the party. - Yeah, I definitely will. - Hmm. - Welcome home. - Likewise, Hank. I hope you enjoy your stay... all 24 hours of it. Watch your step, Boris. I'm more concerned with other people watching it. Remember, Hank, we must preserve appearances at all costs. Synced by emmasan www.Addic7ed.Com I can't believe how big Sashi's gotten. You blink at her age, you miss a lot. Thank you for stopping through on your way to... - Oh. - Wherever you and Boris - are headed to next. - Uh, to be honest, I've kind of lost track of our itinerary myself. I saw him limping earlier. Is he okay? Yeah, I saw that too. Has his... Has his family disease finally kicked in or...? No, no, no, no. Nothing has kicked in. It's totally unrelated to his disease. - Oh. - Uh, we were cliff diving in the Caymans, and he fractured his tibia. - Ouch. - Yeah. - Cliff diving? - When is his cast coming off? Uh, actually, it should come off today. - Great. - Yeah. Hey. See... I thought you were in labor. She's not in labor. We don't have to cancel our party, and you need to dip faster to keep up with my stirring. Dr. Neil determined that the pain earlier was Braxton Hicks. That means a practice contraction. Oh, I totally knew that. Remember what you learned in therapy. Humility is a strength. I totally didn't know that. In fairness, I was humbling Evan long before his therapist was. So, if you're not giving birth today, shouldn't you be back in bed? That's the good news. I am off bed rest. Now? So close to the day? Well, the onset of labor is measured by cervical change, and Divya's cervix is... Not something I'm interested in, but thank you. Thanks, Jeremiah. - What? - Ugh. Lance hurt his arm. - Who's Lance? - He's the lead singer and guitar player for the band we booked for tonight. Sounds like someone should check him out. - Can you? - Um, I'm not sure I can squeeze in another patient. Divya, you're cleared to stand, walk, and work, right? I am. You know, I'm actually not sure that's such a good idea. He's all the way out in Montauk. I can probably shuffle something around. Guys, I got it. Really. - Divya, you're my hero. - Mm. With Valentine's Day hanging in the balance, you are definitely the man for the job. Hey! You're home! Hey! You're not answering any of my texts! Oh, sorry. I was dipping strawberries in chocolate. Hey, I checked with the hospital, but they didn't have you admitted yet. - You called Hank. - Hey, Jeremiah. - It was Braxton Hicks. - Ah. - But welcome home! - Thank you. - Really, Evan? - You said "contraction." How am I... I thought... The point is, I'm so happy to see you. You're here in the nick of time. Someone needs to save Valentine's Day, Henry, and Divya's in no condition to go driving around seeing patients, right? You are definitely the man for the job. We have a musician in Montauk with an injured arm. Henry, he's desperate. Yeah, I'm happy to help. Just let me grab a quick shower. You realize you still haven't given me a "welcome home" hug. - Let's talk after that shower. - Okay, will do. Good to see you guys. Old-school Hankmed back in action. You think giving Hank a patient will keep him here? It's never just a patient with Hank. Wow. No, I... trust me, I'd love to fly to L.A. And play the new forum with you, but I just don't think I'm ready for that. Sorry, Billy. Sorry, Dr. Lawson, to keep you waiting, especially since there's probably not much you can do. It's "Hank," and let's have a look before you turn down another trip to Hollywood. He's always trying to get me to play on the road. I'm not nearly good enough for his shows, but, you know, it's never easy saying no to the piano man. Wait a second. I'm sorry. That Billy was... Billy? He saw me play at a bar over on 27. He must've taken pity on me, because he's been calling me ever since. Wow. That's very cool. - All right, let's take a look. - All right. - Ooh. Okay. Does that hurt? - Ah. Yeah. How did this happen? I got dizzy, I fell, and hit my elbow on the table. - Okay, does any of this hurt? - Mm-mm. - I did save kitty cat, though. - Who? That's the name of my guitar. Jerry Garcia called his "tiger." - So I decided... yeah. - So you call yours "kitty cat." Well, I'm, uh... I'm glad she survived the fall. Not that she's much use to a one-armed musician. Well, let's get you back up to two. This aspiration should resolve the traumatic bursitis, and I think you'll be able to play tonight without a problem. Can you hold that down for me? Thank you. Lance, have you had other dizzy spells? Nothing too unusual. Okay. Other injuries? Falls of any kind? Not unless you count when I was six and I fell off the jungle gym. That's probably when I decided to be a musician, not an athlete. And that's probably not the answer we're looking for, but I'd like to do a head C.T., just to be safe. - Why? - I just want to make sure your dizziness isn't something more serious. Do we really need to go there, doc? It's not very far to go. We can do it tonight before the party, our own little warm-up set. How's that? Is that better? - Wow, yeah. - Okay, good. - Hey. Appletini, please. - Yes, sir. If anyone asks, though, it's a Midori Mojito. Yeah. What? - I didn't say anything. - Your judgment is deafening. Just say it. Just speak your mind. Okay. If you're gonna drink like a woman, own it like a man. You must be really close with Divya. Um, I'm Emma. Evan R. Lawson. Hi. You live here, right? No. I used to. My wife and I just found our own place a few weeks ago. Oh, right. Right. I guess you have to leave the nest sometime. - Uh-huh. - Your dad must get really lonely living here all by himself. My dad? Wow. That's precious. My dad couldn't afford the cable bill here. No, a man named Boris lives here, and my brother and I rent the guesthouse. You know, it's a nice arrangement. Oh, speak of the devil. My brother's right there. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah, you too. Yeah, I just want to drop my stuff off and get back to the party in time for Divya's dad's speech. Wow. Love what you've done with the place. What the hell have you done with it? Well, uh, according to the time-honored roommate code, if you leave without saying good-bye, you know, your roommate takes possession of all furniture and electronics and any hypothetical loose change that might be hiding between the sofa cushions, - even if it's a lot. - Evan, where is all our stuff? Paige and I needed furniture, and furniture's really expensive, and you were off living the high life with Boris, so... Speaking of, how's he doing? Is he okay? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, he's, um... He's doing well. That's great. Is he... cured? Well, the trial isn't about curing the disease. It's about delaying the onset of symptoms. So this weekend is just another pit stop for you? - Mm-hmm. - Like last time? Okay, Lance, you can sit up now. Yes. So I don't know if you know how lucky you are uh, to have Hank taking care of you personally, but he's usually off jetsetting with other patients. - Oh. - You can ask Hank about any medical problem, anything... Anything in the world, like, anything in the universe. - He'll know how to fix it, like... - Okay, Ev, thanks for the plug. Babe, let's give the doctor and his patient some privacy... - What a wonderful idea. - So that Lance can pick Hank's huge, encyclopedic brain. Okay, thank you guys so much, really. I am sorry about that. I'm not sure why they're being so weird. What are they usually like? Uh, well, Paige is usually normal. Actually, there is something I should probably tell you. Yeah? I didn't just fall off that jungle gym when I was young. - My dad dropped me. - Oh. It was the beginning of his Huntington's Disease. You know that with Huntington's, there's a 50/50 chance of... Inheriting it from an affected parent. Yep, I know. And once you get it, it's a death sentence. My dad died less than ten years after his diagnosis. There was so many things he never got a chance to do. He didn't even have a bucket list. Lance, have you taken the blood test to check for the genetic mutation? No. And I won't. I don't want a Huntington's diagnosis to control my life. If I do, then the disease kills me before I even get sick. Well, the good news is that your C.T. is clean. Of course it is. You're one of the ten best doctors in the Hamptons.

I mean, that was really impressive. Oh, I kind of botched that last stanza. - What? - Good thing the drinks are strong, right? Lance, it was awesome... So awesome, in fact, I got to ask, why are you playing a winter party at a summer resort when you could definitely be playing a sold-out L.A. arena? This is a perfectly good gig. Yeah, sure, but is it the gig you want? You said you don't want to take the test 'cause you don't want Huntington's to control your life. Is it possible that not taking the test is controlling your life even more? You've given me a lot to think about. And I will, right after this next set. Okay, good. - Thank you. - Yeah. Okay, I'm done being a groupie. How about a dance? Hank, my water just broke. Almost there. It's right here. Now, Divya, you're sure this isn't Braxton Hicks? - Oh! Oh! - Okay, I get it! I get it! I get it! Oh! Oh, my God. I think we made a wrong turn into the Waldorf Astoria. Actually, the hospital gave Divya a courtesy upgrade. Yeah, they did. Here we go. Easy, easy. - Lights dimmed to 50%, please. - Check. My iPod set to soothing playlist number one. Check. All right, excuse me, folks. - I'm Tamara. - Okay. Here we go. Hi, Divya. Go ahead and scooch down and bend your knees for me, okay? - Uh-huh. - Okay. Just let your legs fall apart, all right? There we go. Wait a second. Wait a second. It's coming right now? Right this moment? It's coming out right now? Are you gonna be a problem? Is he gonna be a problem? - He might be. - Yeah. - We'll get the chocolate cigars. - Or a pacifier. All right, just breathe. You're gonna feel a little bit of pressure. - Mm-hmm. - All right, there you go. Mm-hmm. Great. Very good. 8? - Okay, 7. - 1 centimeter.

Whoo! - Hey, Lance, are you... - Yeah. - Are you okay? - I'm great. My degenerative terminal illness is just acting up a bit. Symptoms started shortly after I saw you last February. That's a fast progression for three months. What did Dr. Sacani say when he followed up with you? Uh, he referred me to a Huntington's specialist. You were right last Valentine's about confronting the question. So, when symptoms acted up shortly after that, I was... I was ready and not exactly surprised. I'm just glad Divya liked the music enough to hire me back for this one. Lance, I can help you navigate this disease. - Hey, man, you got a sec? - Yeah. Excuse me, Hank. The guys probably want to know why I was break-dancing during my solo. Yeah. Okay. It appears I've healed just as we expected. Yeah, right. You've made this a part of my official medical file, yes? Yes, anyone who reviews your history will see what you're seeing now. Excellent. This puts us right on schedule for Monte Carlo. Sorry to interrupt. We were just trying to find a place to have dinner. We'll just find another room. How long was she standing there? - I don't know. - Did she see the X-ray? I don't know that either, but I'll talk to her. - Don't talk to me. - Divya, it's been six hours, and you know that pitocin is a normal, proven method of stimulating labor. My baby will come when the time is... right! Okay, I just think you need... Do... not... talk... to... me. Okay. Pitocin is not part of her birth plan. ♪ You're the quiet type ♪ God, I can't believe I missed three months of this. Motherhood comes so easily to you.

"Evan, Evan, all the girls want to dance with you." I know, but I'm choosing you. Can I, please? I promise to have her back by a reasonable hour. - Watch this... master at work. - Okay. Give me 90 seconds. Big mistake. ♪ Under the moonlight ♪ ♪ Under the moonlight ♪ He really has bonded with her. He has. Hopefully, the next time I see her, she'll have a better date. Next time you see her, she may be going to prom. I really am so sorry about the last time. You don't have to apologize. But I was wondering about Boris. Oh. I saw the X-ray that he was holding. He's losing bone density, which could indicate he's becoming symptomatic. Yeah, and... and I'm sorry if I misled you. He just... he wants to keep this very quiet. - Okay. - Okay? Thank you. Hey. Oh, where did your friend go? - My friend? - Yeah. The adorable young girl, Emma. No. Emma said she was your friend. She told me the same thing. Emma told me she was a patient. Okay, don't worry, guys. I've got this covered. ♪ Makes me feel all right with you under the moonlight ♪ ♪ Makes me feel all right ♪ ♪ With you under ♪ ♪ The moonlight ♪ Lance. Lance! Lance, are you okay? - I think I broke my hip. - Does your neck hurt? - No. - Okay. Divya, maintain inline stabilization. Mm-hmm. - Lance, does that hurt? - No. - Okay, how about that? - No. - His pulse is getting thready. - Okay. This? Oh! - Okay, and here? - Aah! Okay, it's not his hip. He fractured his pelvis. - Evan? - 911, I know. We need to stop the bleeding, or he could exsanguinate. Okay, we need to force his pelvic ring closed, now. Uh... This could work. Aah! Aah! Okay. - Aah! What's he doing? - Are you making a circumferential compression binder? I'm trying to, yeah. Okay. Jeremiah, can you hold that tight? Thank you. This should work. Sorry, kitty cat. Good. - Okay, Lance? - Yeah. - This is gonna hurt. - Okay. Aah! Okay. - Pulse is steadying. - Good. Good. What's gonna happen to me? Okay, the bad news is you'll need emergency angiography with embolization and then pelvic surgery to repair the break. - Is there any good news? - There may be. Lance, did you ever actually see that specialist Dr. Sacani referred you to? And you never took the genetic test? - Why? To confirm the obvious? - No, to rule it out. Lance, I don't think you have Huntington's Disease. Will you give us a minute please? - Is she armed? - No. - On any drugs? - We don't believe so. Then I will be fine. I know why you're here. And you're probably going to be really bummed when I tell you that the man you're looking for is not. Yeah, I already found that out. It was a long trip for nothing. Even a short trip to find a famous person seems a little silly. He's more than just a famous person to me, and I'm more than just a fan. Have you ever even met him? No, that's the whole point. Well, these nice gentlemen will be happy to drive you wherever you'd like to go, and I am sure with time, you will outgrow this little obsession that you have. But, please... Don't come near me or my family ever again, because the next time, these gentlemen will not be as nice, and nor will I. She's all yours. - Hey, Lance. - Hey. Whoa. Did you get your pelvis fixed, or are you just happy to see us? Am I happy to see you? So, Lance, the angiogram shows your symptoms have been caused by moyamoya, which is Japanese for "puff of smoke." Wow. One more reason to quit. Uh, no, it's not actual smoke. It's a bunch of small blood vessels that form to compensate for a blockage in the carotid artery. How did you figure it was moyamoya? Well, during your solo, I saw you not getting enough oxygen, and hypoxia is not a symptom of Huntington's, so... So what caused the blockage? Hard to say for sure, but it might have formed when your dad dropped you from the jungle gym. So I did get a condition from my father. Speaking of which... Your blood work came back. Now, I just need to confirm that you want the result of your Huntington's test. - I do. - Okay. Wow. Wow. Thank you, Hank. Really. I was so sure I had it, I... I avoided the opportunity to be proven wrong. And in the process, I avoided a lot of other opportunities too. Well, you just need a procedure to correct the blockage, and after that... I can finally pursue the career I want. So the next time the piano man calls... Kitty cat and I will answer. About kitty cat, uh, medically speaking, she didn't fare quite as well as you. Oh, no. Well, she had a good run. She did. She did. - Oh, hey. - Hey. Why'd you, uh, step out? I just wanted to give a doctor and his patient some privacy, - you know. - Oh, well, thank you. Good thing for him you were around. Yeah, well, you know, I caught a lucky break. Don't worry. That was just a compliment. That was not me trying to get you to stick around like before, okay? - No, I... - No, I get it. You... you're a different kind of doctor now. It's... it's cool. No, that's not true, Ev. I'm not. You should take it. It's probably someone important. Dilated to 5 centimeters. - At least there's progress. - Yeah. But the baby's now in the occiput posterior position, and as you well know, delivering sunny-side up can be very risky. Divya, it's been nine hours. You have a slight fever. I really think you need to consider... Divya has a very specific birth plan. Okay, well, sometimes plans have to change. I'd like to try different laboring positions - to adjust the baby. - Okay. I'll be back in a few hours, then. Okay. - Hank, just take the call. - No, no, no, I can't leave now. Unfortunately, this is gonna be a while. - Okay, okay. - Mm-hmm. Yeah? Oh, easy. Uh, now... now rotate your hips. Maybe more like you're hula-hooping. I've never used a hula hoop. Me neither. A wire must have come loose. No, the baby's heart rate is dropping. - Is dropping to what? - It's... The baby is in distress, and your B.P. is dropping. - A placental abruption? - It's possible. Let's get that C-section now. There's a lot happening here too, so just tell me what's going on. It's begun. I've broken my leg. You broke it now? Wait a second. Is this... are you sure? Hank, it's broken. O... Okay. Okay, I can be on the jet tomorrow. Make it tonight, please. No, Boris, I said tomorrow, and I really can't sit here arguing with you about it. I think I made myself quite clear. Yeah, you have. Tamara! She's in the O.R... Emergency C-section. Here is your perfect baby. Hi. - Oh, my God! - Hi. Sobald die arzt bereit ist. Ah. Where is your bag? I can't come to terms with leaving again. You made a commitment to me, Hank, and we have a very specific plan. sometimes plans have to change. I'll still fly to wherever I need to to continue administering the monthly dose - of your trial medication. - It's not just about the trial. - And you know it. - I do... which is why I should've stayed behind the last time. Is this about your patients here? It's about them and much more. I don't want to be a helicopter physician anymore. You can be any kind of physician you like after we've fulfilled our objectives. I'll see you on board. We leave in ten minutes. Come to terms with that however you like. - I mean, look... - I can't look, 'cause I'm trying to look at the ball, okay? - Don't get me wrong. I'm... - Okay. I'm thrilled you're back. I just want to know why you changed your mind. Helping Lance made me remember what I've been missing. Good. What about Boris? He's a patient too. He's the patient. He's top priority around here, right? Yeah, Boris is a... complicated man. That's a groundbreaking insight. Thank you. I'm gonna more beer now. Maybe if I get you drunk, I'll get a straight answer out of you. __ - Mama? - Hmm? - I'll be back. - Okay, baby. So... - I had a major epiphany. - Yeah? When? - Over the winter? - No, just now in the kitchen. Oh, you found beer and enlightenment. I realized it doesn't matter about Boris. I'm just happy the family's back together. - Yeah. - We're together. You and me are back together again. Things are finally back to normal around here. To normal.
