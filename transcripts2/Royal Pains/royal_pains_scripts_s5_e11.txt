 Previously on Royal Pains... No, Divya's taking care of me, so... you called six times to tell me you're drunk with Divya? No, of course not. Divya's pregnant. She's not drinking I am officially homeless. You could stay at my house. I got you these. - Thanks. - Flak pills. - Ow! Ow! Ow. - All right, stop, stop, stop. Can you give her something for the pain?

 Molly, take one of these hydrocodone. It'll help. Turn around. Whoa, Molly! Molly! Dad? Dad? The police want you to submit to a tox screen. And I told them that wouldn't be a problem. It isn't a problem, is it? Of course not. Uh, he's developed a low-grade fever over the past few hours. Yes, I know. But other than that, his vitals are stable. And we're hopeful we can get him off the ventilator. Yes. I know. - And Molly's getting... - Her wound redressed.

 I just came to give you this. Oh, uh... Dr. Shackleford said you'd want it. - Why didn't she just call? - That, I don't know. Evan? - Whoa. - Hi, honey. - Hi. - I brought you some... oh, coffee. Thank God. - I've been jonesing for some. - Oh, it's herbal tea. I thought you were avoiding caffeine. I was. I was. I-I fell off the wagon. - In Italy? - Well, yeah. You know, it's... but herbal tea's so much healthier. Thank you. It's... this is great. Aw, yeah. That's so lemony and zingy. - Is this my blouse? - Yes, it is. I-I thought you wanted to wear it today. So I was gonna surprise you, but... oh, I was. Uh, but then I thought with the heat and the long sleeves... - okay, that's fine. - No, no, no. But it's such a nice blouse. And I-it's so wrinkle-free. I'm gonna put it on right now. Great, all right, I'm gonna get some lemon for my tea. - Okay, great. - Okay. We usually have breakfast in the breakfast room. It's so beautiful out. I thought we could break our morning routine. But it... it's called the breakfast room. I have your oatmeal, no cinnamon, water, no ice, and your orange juice with pulp. The vesicles improve antioxidant status. You don't say. Hm. Everything okay? Uh, I've been trying to consult with a surgeon. But she keeps postponing. It's hard getting a surgeon to focus when they're not cutting into something. Sometimes, you have to get creative. - Creative. - Mm. Thank you. I couldn't help noticing the flyer on the kitchen table for a lamaze class. Yes, I need to sign up. - Do you have a partner? - I don't. I could be your partner. Well, that would be very nice. Thank you, Jeremiah. You're welcome. - Could you pass the... - Mmhmm. Hm. Hello? Hey. Hey, thanks for coming over here. Yeah. The doctor's gonna take don off the ventilator so I just wanna stay close by. He gonna be all right? - I hope so. - Me too. Wow. How lucky is he you were there to save him? Yeah, listen, because I was driving and there was an accident, they did a tox screen. Mine came back positive. As in you had drugs in your system? Just pain medication that was prescribed to me. It's nothing to worry about. I wasn't gonna worry. I'm a little surprised you've been on painkillers. Well I am still recovering from my craniotomy. So did Divya prescribe them? Hank, may I speak with your privately. Hello, Evan. Hi. Wait a second, did Jeremiah prescribe them? Yes, he did. Look, if it's about me you're free to say anything in front of Evan. Uh, okay. The police called to verify that I was your prescribing physician. The police called about the tox screening? I assured them that you were titrating the hydrocodone, that I'd given you five pills over a week ago, so I'd imagine you've been off those for a few days, and as a result, negligible would show up if any. Well, they did show up. His test came back positive. Look, I went through the pills you gave me, Jeremiah. I'm still feeling some pain, so I, uh... I stopped into a pain clinic and got some more. You saw another doctor? Yeah, it's not a big deal. How many pills have you taken? I'm only taking them when I feel pain. Uh, one a day? Sometimes two tops. Look, I need to go check on don. For the record, I haven't taken one since yesterday but if you guys are so worried... There. Okay? All gone. The fourth key to success in my book is focus. How do we tune out the noise? How do we tune out those e-mails, the text, Twitter? All right, that one is difficult. And our phones. And that is exactly what I'm talking about. We are so attached to our devices. We need to make contact with the outside world at every moment. It doesn't allow us to be... I think that's yours. In the moment. Oh. Okay, listen, I have to take this. It's my son. Hi, Evan. Everything okay? Don't go anywhere. I am coming right over. Sync & corrections by wilson0804 www.Addic7ed.com You have no idea how much it means to me you just dropping everything and coming out here like this. Are you kidding? Do you know how much you and Hank mean to me? I'm just so happy that my seminar was only a ferry ride away. Yeah, me too. God, I hope I'm not overreacting. It's just Hank, pain-killers. It kinda sounds ridiculous when you think about it. When it comes to addiction, there is no overreacting. Well, I didn't say he was addicted. You cannot minimize. Things will just spin outta control. I didn't say he was gonna spin outta control either. You gotta nip it. Trust me. I know from past experience and here it is. You boys have the genetic predisposition. Wait, you had problems? Have. It's never in the past tense. With what? Well, my problem was never with substances. My addiction is to embellishment. I'm sorry, what? Years ago, I had a tiny problem with compulsive lying. See, there I go again 'cause it wasn't so tiny. Well, we all knew you meant well. That's... that's not a big deal. Don't sugarcoat it. When it comes to Hank, we have to be ruthless. Okay. Good. That's great. Ruthless. You, me, help Hank, together. - You, me, and Lacy. - Who? Lacy sinclair, former addict turned sobriety guru. Look, when I got out of prison, I still had things to work out. And Lacy was there for me. So as soon as I got your phone call I called her, she offered to help. So I booked the after party. - The what? - The after party. That's Lacy's facility right here in the Hamptons. Trust me. Eddie. What a nice surprise. Hank is on drugs. We're gonna help him. Dad. You're not kidding. Look, Hank has been taking some pain-killers because of his surgery. No way. If Hank were taking pain-killers, he would've told me. Well, he had Jeremiah prescribe them. Eddie. When did you get here? As soon as I got Evan's call. And sweetie, call me "dad." What are you doing here? So there's a bit of a family emergency. - There is? - Yeah. - Well, Hank's an add... - Amazing person. He's an amazing person who, unbeknownst to us, has been feeling some pain since his surgery and apparently he's been taking some meds to handle the pain. I still find this hard to believe. Oh, my God. Is he okay? Oh, he will be. I guarantee it. How didn't I know about this? Well, we all just found about it this morning. But you didn't call me. Well, I knew you had a busy day with Russel, so I didn't wanna interrupt. That's so sweet, but if someone we love is in trouble, interrupt me. Well, that is so sweet. But I love you so I was trying to be supportive. - Enjoying your coffee? - Yes. Nice blouse. Could we focus back on Hank? Could you lovebirds stop arguing? - We weren't arguing. - Not at all. - See? - Good. Because we've gotta get over to the after party estate to plan Hank's intervention. Let's go. All right. Intervention? Seriously? I know it sounds a little dramatic, but yeah, it's a... Sorry. I can't join you for that. I'm going to find Hank and speak with him directly. Divya, that is a great idea. You can lure him there. Lure him? Yes, we have to surprise him. So you could make up something about a-a complicated patient. Sanctioned lies do not count. Got it. Hank doesn't need an intervention. This is ludicrous. And I'm not luring him anywhere. Let's go. Come on. Just aced the practice test, dad. Yeah. Mr. Lopez is gonna let me make up the final. The ct confirmed what we feared. Don has pneumonia, hence his fever. Yeah, I was afraid he aspirated when I put in the laryngeal mask. It's the risk you take using a laryngeal mask instead of rapid-sequence intubation. Well, hopefully, the antibiotics will work quickly and we can get him off the vent in a few hours. Slow down, cowboy. I'm more of a one-step-at-a-time practitioner. And I'd like to look ahead. Dr. Shackleford may have okayed you being involved in the case as the doctor of record. But as the head of the icu, I'd like to get his fever under control first and then go from there. Welcome to the after party. Keeping it real, Eddie? Always, huh? Give me some sugar. Mm. - Ha. - All right, Evan, Paige, meet my saving grace, Lacy sinclair. Hi. Oh, no, I always hug... Okay. Especially since I feel like I know you the way Eddie talks about you. - Really? - He's my hero. - Aw. - Hero? Never seen anyone go cold Turkey on lying like he did. Well, you know, I've had some minor relapses. - Temptation is everywhere. - Yes. - Huh, so it seems. - Oh, these? No, I would never have bought booze this cheap. My most recent guest snuck it in, hid them in the hedgerow. Ah, hedgerow. They just weren't ready to start fresh. Oh, think I spilled some on me. Ah, yeah. It smells strong. So Lacy, how did you become a sobriety guru? Well, you wake up in the neighbor's vegetable garden enough times, you start to wonder if there's not a better way to make a salad. - Hm. - Mm-hmm. - Right. - Mm-hmm. Um, so no offense to you or any of this, but you really think this is what Hank needs? - Mm-hmm. - An intervention here? I don't call them interventions. It just sounds too confrontational for me. I call this "an invitation." Oh, an invitation. As in you are invited to regain control of your life. Did I not tell you that this woman was the best? Huh? My first intervention was in a motel 6 conference room with cold coffee and folding chairs. But sober doesn't have to look like that. My life now is still just as fun, but infinitely more fulfilling. And that's what I wanna share with your brother. So come on, let's get this after party started. Come on. - Thank you. - Here we go. Dr. Jory. You've been avoiding my calls. I'm sorry. Who are you? Dr. Jeremiah Sacani. Ah, Dr. Sacani. Well, I haven't been avoiding you. I've had to postpone a few times. If it was urgent, I misunderstood. Well, Hank is still in pain. During his craniotomy, did you perhaps violate his pia? What? During his craniotomy, did anything out of the ordinary happen? Leaking? Plunging? I don't care to be grilled on my surgery technique. Well, 83% of your procedures over the last 4 years have been back fusions. Meaning? You do far fewer craniotomies than the average neurosurgeon. But more than you. I simply want to determine if you caused my friend... my patient to have a stroke. Have you seen manual dexterity deficits? Aphasia? Nystagmus? Dysarthria? No, but there still could be... doesn't sound like a stroke to me. Now, that sounds like a stroke. What are you doing? Turning down the sedation to activate your father's respiratory drive. Your dad's fever has stabilized. So we're gonna see if he's ready to breathe on his own. Dr. Oren's turning down the ventilator settings. So why are you here? I'm your dad's doctor. And I care about him. Look, Molly, I know you're angry with me. But I promise I'm here to do everything I can for him and for you. You gave me just one of those pills. And I was totally zoned out. So how messed up were you when you were doing everything you could for him? What... what's happening? Don? He... he's over-breathing the vent. - We need sedatives on board! - 100 of diprivan, please. It's okay. Easy, don. Okay, good. Thank you. Easy. Easy. He's settling down. Doesn't look like he's getting off today. If his lungs aren't ready, it's best we give his body more time to fight off the infection. So... Why are you here? Uh, Dr. Oren. Oh, Dr. Lawson. I think Molly's warming up to us. Yeah. - Buy you a coffee? - Uh, no, thank you. Listen, you and I both know every hour don's in a coma his prognosis gets worse. We need to be more aggressive. I wanna give him a course of high-does steroids. Absolutely not. Look, I've prescribed him steroids before and he's responded well. I imagine that was before he was in a coma. I understand your concerns, but I am don's doctor. So am I, and it's my icu. Hank. - Hey. - Hey. Are you okay? Evan told you about the tox screen. Look, there's nothing to worry about, okay? I have a warranted prescription and I wasn't impaired. Yes, Molly wanted the screening, but she's a scared, angry, kid who's worried about her dad. What about your pain? I had brain surgery. Eight months ago and now you are sweaty, and... I was outside chasing down Dr. Oren. And interrupting me. Sorry. I'm sorry. Why did you keep this a secret? It wasn't a secret. It was personal. Now's not a good time. I have to get back to don. We'll talk later. Hank! You don't look like you should be taking care of anyone but yourself. Now, when was the last time you took a pill? I'm fine. Evan told me about Hank's pain medicine. - You're concerned? - Yes, I am. Have you ever heard of post-craniotomy pain lasting eight months? I've discovered a few rare cases. I should have started investigating sooner. Pain management is a nuanced field. He's worse today, I can tell. And Evan wants me to bring him to see a patient at 4:00. I think he needs to rest. Did Evan say who this patient is? Just that it was a complicated case and that I should convince him to leave the hospital for it. Hmm. I think I know the patient that Evan is referring to. And, yes, it's important that Hank is there. I need to go. Okay. Is she drunk? She's definitely something. Do you need help? No, I'm good. Thanks. My new heels are killing me. Well, I have the social lubricant. Fruit-infused water. Emotional outpourings can be draining so hydration is key. The fruit just makes it fun. - It does. - Yes. - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Oh, this is Divya. Divya works with Hankmed. Hi, nice to meet you. Please join us. Thank you. Hey. Why'd you change your mind? I'm here to help Hank and I'm reserving judgment on this intervention. It's an invitation. - A what? - An invitation. Thanks, Lacy. Oh, you know what, that's mine. Here, you take this one. - Oh, okay. - Okay. Good. All right, so let's prepare ourselves for Hank's arrival. Yeah, so we start by communicating openly I call this stage mingling. You make a more significant connection with another guest when you really open yourselves up. Yeah? Okay. Eddie, would you like to start us off? Sure. Hello, uh, my name is Eddie hi, Eddie. I know that an invitation is probably more than Hank needs. I mean, he's not chasing the dolphin here. Pretty sure that's "dragon," dad. Yeah, well, what I wanna do is nip it in the bud so he doesn't become too much like his old man. Now, before I became a renowned author... - Eddie. - A published author, I was a convicted felon. Well, we all take detours. We do. Especially the Lawson men. Remember the problem that Hank had with a hospital in Brooklyn? Then he moved out here and everything just took off like a rocket? Yes. And you, you always had terrible trouble with women. You could never keep a relationship going. Remember when you had that thing for Divya and now look at you. All of a sudden you've got this beautiful wife... I'm sorry. You and Divya? No... What? No. There w... there wasn't any of me and Divya. Absolutely not. - Well, there was a small... - Dad. Did anything ever happen? - No. No. - No. Did you say a thing for Divya or a thing with Divya? No, definitely for Divya. It was a small crush. Okay, the... no. No for, no with, no crush. Or... there was nothing. Less than nothing. I am not attracted to Divya at all anymore. "Anymore?" So there was a for. Look, for one, what... why would you do this? Lacy. Lacy. - Hey, you all right? - What happened? Evan said it was a complicated patient. He didn't say who. I can call him. Uh, look, I really can't get away. Would you mind... help! Help my dad! He's in trouble. What is it? What is it... what's happening? Oh, he's okay. The pulse oximeter slipped off his finger. It monitors blood oxygenation and when it stopped the alarm sounded. But it's working now. He's okay. Evan, I am so very, very sorry. I thought everybody knew. Dad, there's nothing to know. That's why I'm gonna talk to Paige. I'm gonna straighten everything out. No, you're not. No. Okay? I'll handle it. You wanna straighten someone out straighten out your friend, the drunk interventionist. - Invitationist. - Whatever she is! And just because Lacy is a recovering addict doesn't mean that she's a drunk. Can we look at the facts for a second? - Sure. - One, she could barely - carry the tray. - Mmhmm. Okay? Two, she insisted on drinking from a specific glass, and three, she fell into her own pool. There is an explanation for all of that. I'm gonna find out what it is and bring it back to you. Lacy is clean. Trust me. Look, I'm not attracted to Divya. So there's nothing to talk about. - It's exactly what I'm saying. - Good. How you doing? Other than my ego, I'm dandy. Okay, look, I've got to ask you this. Are you using again? Eddie, I fell because I got a little wobbly. - Mm-hmm. - Trust me. I know the difference. You told me you fell because you weren't watching where you were going. Yes and, I mean, I have felt a little unbalanced lately. In fact, I took a tumble on my deck last week. And I wasn't using then either. Have your falls been precipitated by any other symptoms? Some dry mouth and... I mean, I have been spaced out and disoriented at times. - Have you seen a doctor? - No. Doctors just wanna give you pills, and I won't take them. The strongest thing I'll put in my system now is aspirin. Why do you take aspirin? It just helps with some occasional pain I have in my side. So when was the last time you took aspirin? Well, today when I was passing out the drinks. I dissolve mine in water. Even the action of popping pills is something I want no part of. And that's why you didn't want Evan to take your drink. Exactly. I just chalk up the dry mouth and wobbliness to the damage I did to my system when I was using. You should know I was a pretty experimental chick back then. How "pretty experimental?" Coke, pot, pills, shrooms, bananadine. Why don't I take some blood just to be on the safe side? Good idea. And I'll take it right over to the hospital for some analysis. No, you stay. I'll send someone. We have too much work to do preparing for Hank. One thing we cannot have is distractions. Hi. I thought you could use some clean clothes and a shower. I borrowed some scrubs for you. Sorry if you don't like the smell. Molly, I know you wanna take care of your dad, but you won't be able to if you don't take care of yourself. I can sit with him till you get back. We'll take shifts. Fine. We'll take shifts. Mine's not finished. - Listen, you need to k... - He's my dad. Don't you have a family of your own? Or at least other patients? By the way, a shower wouldn't hurt you either. Okay. We're not having problems, so there's nothing to talk about. So why are we talking about this? We're here for Hank, right? Yes, but we can't invite Hank here to fight his problems if we're fighting amongst ourselves. - Well said, Eddie. - Thank you. And why not talk about it? Are you hiding something? Of course not. So tell me, what happened? Nothing! Paige, I think it's called chemistry. Yes, it's chemistry. Okay, chemistry is so much worse. Then not that. Can I jump in here? - Of course, Divya. - Thank you. Chemistry requires two sides and in this particular matter, there was only one ever. True. Who'd hit on anything with a pulse. That is entirely not true, Divya, but thanks a lot. Paige, let me ask you a question. Haven't we all had previous relationships? It was not a relationship. Stop answering together! Paige, why should feelings that Evan had long before he ever met you matter so much? You guys have been spending so much time together, and I see you two. You have fun with each other. Yeah, as friends. Paige. I have never been attracted to Evan. In fact, sometimes I find him crass, offensive, and vile. That is my husband you're talking about. - Thank you, honey. - Oh, don't you honey me. - Wha... - Hello, everybody. What's going on? Dad? Hello, Hank. Uh, this is Lacy. Hi. - Hello. - Are you the patient? No. Welcome to the after party. To the what now? Kiddo, have a seat. Wait, I'm sorry. Why are you all here? You know what, that is a really great question and just before I answer it, let me just say, every single person here is loving you like crazy. - Are you? - Mm-hmm. - There is no patient? - No. This is an intervention. Invitation. That's what Lacy calls it. I didn't know. Yeah, you and me both. Uh, no offense, but I'm gonna have to decline the invitation. Okay, look, it doesn't matter what it's called. We're all here to talk. And find out some things. I'm happy to talk, but I don't need whatever this is. Yes, but we're all here now, so just give it, like, a few minutes. Why? You tricked me into coming here when I don't have a problem. But I do have a patient in the icu. - No, just... - No. Let go. - Not until you sit down. - No, I'm not staying. - Yes, you are staying. - No, I'm... - no. - Let go. I'm not staying here. - Yes, you are. - No. Let go. - I'm not having... - Boys. Boys, stop it! Sit down for two sec... What? I'm sorry. Are you okay? - What is it? - My arm. It's radiating pain shooting down from my neck. Has this happened before? I felt pain in my neck and shoulder, but never my arm. But you were taking the pain medication. So even if this was going on, it could have been masked. Okay, okay. Now it's better. This is radicular pain. What's that? Is that a bad thing? It's radiating pain caused by inflammation around the nerve coming from his spinal cord. Have you had any falls since your surgery? No. What would happen if he had one before? You fell off that barstool. - What barstool? - At Evan and Paige's wedding. Maybe all this time you have been misinterpreting radicular pain as post-surgical pain. It would explain why this hasn't gotten any better and why you felt the need for ongoing pain medication. And if it is radicular... well, then we can do something about it. Like what? Like fix it? Yeah, but first I need to get an mri. And so what are we waiting for? This holographic image of your neck shows the damage to your vertebrae. Well, your CT myelogram and follow up MRIs both confirm... a c6 radiculopathy. I can't believe it. All this time right under my nose. And your neurosurgeon wouldn't have found it on either your pre or post-operative craniotomy MRIs because it is too low on your neck. Right. Dr. Lawson, I'm about ready for the translaminar corticosteroid injection. Okay. Thank you. Hopefully this will reduce the nerve route inflammation. Although, it's possible you may need another. It's possible I'll need surgery too. We'll have to see how I feel after the injection. Hank, I owe you an apology. Why? It took me so long to find this answer and it was such a simple answer. I caused you weeks of unnecessary pain. Oh, please, that's my fault. It's hard to make a diagnosis when your patient's an uncooperative pain in the... Neck. I'm sorry. Okay, Dr. Lawson. Let's have you lay down. Okay. See you on the other side. Turns out your blood work came back negative for all the usual suspects of past alcohol and drug abuse, but positive for low hemoglobin. I have no idea what the means. It means no cause for alarm. But while we're here I'd like to run some tests for possible causes of anemia. Okay, would any of those causes make my stomach hurt? Hey, so dad and Paige are already in there. Jeremiah sent some cryptic text that it's Hank's c6 that's radicular. What does that mean? Is that good or bad? That means Hank can be treated. Oh, my God, Divya, that's great. Good stuff. I'm so sorry. Oh. I'm so sorry I didn't believe in your "let's have a party" technique 'cause it worked. It worked like a charm. I mean, in a roundabout kind of way, but it... Is that what I think it is? Because I can't think of anything worse. Lacy, you vomited blood. Come here. Oh, blood. Oh. That's worse. Lacy, I think the pain that you described earlier may be coming from an ulcer, which would explain why your hemoglobin is low. We need to stop the bleeding. Yes, you stop the bleeding. I'm gonna get a clean shirt. Oh, I'm so sorry, Evan. No, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry you vomited... Warm blood. Would an ulcer cause falling and light-headedness? No. Lacy, you said that you only take aspirin. - Right. - How much? I don't know, six, eight a day? Lacy, you have aspirin poisoning. I was just trying to treat myself without having to look at a prescription bottle in my cabinet. A different pill, while it may have triggered memories of addiction, would have treated your ulcer properly. But don't worry. Some h-2 blockers and going cold Turkey on the aspirin will take care of it. Let's get you inside. Yeah. Hank is outside. How's Lacy? The gastroscopy stopped the bleeding in her stomach. She'll be able to go home first thing in the morning. Thank goodness. Okay, Divya. I feel horrible about exposing the history between you and Evan. - Eddie. - Yeah? - There was no history wi... - Divya? What happens between two people should remain private. I'm down with that. Ugh. Well, what a wonderful day this turned out to be. I wanted to apologize for a insulting your husband before. I hope you know that I would never intervene, intercede, inter-anything with the two of you. It's not who I am, and... You are both way too important to me as friends. As family. Thank you. I suppose I got jealous because things aren't really going so well, and I needed someone to blame. Well, I'm here if you ever need to talk. Hank, you look like a million dollars. You look so much better. Yes, the single injection was effective. Well, thank goodness. I have to admit, it's been a difficult day. Difficult year, actually. I wish we'd known. We could have done more for you. I know, but even though I didn't ask, you were all there for me anyway. Well, yeah, that's what family's for, Henry. Amen to that. I'm sorry I worried you all. I'm sorry I kept this secret. I should never have tried to do this on my own, and I will never make that mistake again. A few more weeks on those meds, I may have needed an intervention. I mean an invitation. Oh, yeah. I, uh... I love you guys. We love you too. Amen again. We love you, Hank. - Oh. - Yes, we do. - Oh, wow. - It's a group hug. - It's a group hug. - Ow. Okay. Okay. Enough. I have to get back to my patient. He's been waiting all day for me... To be me. I'll see you back at the guesthouse. I'll walk inside with you. Back to helping patients, just like the super doctor you are. Okay. So, Jeremiah, what a pleasure to finally meet you. We met last summer at the staff meeting. - Oh. - At the guesthouse? Huh. Paige baked muffins. You know what, I think we should ride together. Yes, that way we can get better acquainted. - Uh, if you say so. - Uh-huh. You know, chapter 16 in my book is all about relaxing. - Mm-hmm? - Yeah. You know you have nothing to worry about, right? Paige, I love you. No one else but you. I've never loved anybody even close to as much as I love you. I don't know why I got so upset. I guess it's because you and Divya get along so well. Yeah, we do. As friends. I promise that crush was over a long time ago. Wasn't even a crush anyway. It wasn't like Jeremiah and Divya. When I met... Jeremiah and Divya? Oh, yeah. Jeremiah's completely in love with Divya. Didn't I tell you that? No. Yep. Since last summer. Head over heels. Divya has no idea. Okay, have you put up the hydrocortisone? - Yes. - Okay, good. Thank you. What's happening? I'm gonna treat your dad with a course of high-dose steroids. Why? Is he getting worse? Nope, there's been no change. I told Dr. Oren I wanna try to get him off the ventilator. I'm hoping a more aggressive course of treatment can do that. Instead of just sitting and waiting, I wanna make your dad better. I wanna help him wake up. I guess it's my turn for break. Okay. Jeremiah. I was gonna pick up Indian food because I thought you might like it. But then I thought that might be offensive. And I know how much you enjoy Italian cuisine. That's very kind. It's such a beautiful night, I thought we might have dinner outside. The candles are insect repellant and then we can review the research I did for our lamaze class. Then maybe get a head start on practicing breathing techniques. After we digest our food. Funny thing, Jeremiah. It turns out that I don't need to attend this particular class until closer to my delivery date. Oh, I'll keep the materials then. My mother should be back by then. She'll probably want to be my partner. But thank you, Jeremiah. Of course, I'm... I'm sure she would wanna do that. Also... My landlord called. And it seems my apartment will be ready soon. So I'll finally be able to move back home and be out of your hair. - That's great news. - Huh. I'll go wash up then? - Dad? - Yeah. To you. You show up and somehow everything seems to work out. It's a talent. Seriously though, thank you. Thanks for showing up when we needed you. Like I would be anywhere else. Also, um... I know a lot of recovery is about forgiveness. So I just wanted to say... I forgive you for everything. 'Cause all the things you've done, fighting to get your life back, fighting to get us back, I'm sure none of that was easy. And I apologize to you if I created any tension between you and Paige. No. No... I mean, you completely did, but we worked everything out. Everything? That's wonderful for you. Ev... that's great. Okay, maybe not everything. Trust me, Evan, marriage is hard work. Yeah, I'm learning that. But it's better. Especially since the whole Divya misunderstanding's over with. It's, uh... it's feeling better. All right, so you both understand that Divya's not the problem? That is wonderful. But what do you think the problem is? He's crashing. I need a triple lumen kit. Somebody flush the cords. Let's start a levophed drip. Prepping for a central line. Let's get him into trendelenberg now. Thank you. Levophed drip. What's happening? Okay, inserting the needle. And aspirating. BP's down to 80 over 50. What's happening to him? Inserting the guide wire. Running a bolus of two liters normal saline wide open. What did you do to my dad?
