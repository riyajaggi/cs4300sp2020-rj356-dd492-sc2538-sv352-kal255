 Previously on Caprica... My time with the STO is leading me on a different path. Robot, shoot this man! Stop! How did you get that robot to stop? I don't know. I just told it to. This girl, Lacy Rand, exerts unexplained control over war machines we bought on the black market. You know what needs to be done. I'll see to it. The Guatrau can't know I'm sending robots to the Tauron resistance.

 Fidelia Fazekas! What the frak? Just looking into some stuff for the Guatrau. Looks to me like two in every two dozen or so robots isn't making it to the military. What, has he got you checking up on me? Just getting me up to speed. If we're gonna go up against the Guatrau, we're gonna have to do it together. I need to finish what I started and take down Clarice. This is the same model as Clarice's, but I've had it rigged. Amanda, I need you to go back in there, bring me back the original. Hold on a second. This isn't your band. Amanda. She took it. Everything is on that band.

 We have 24 hours to find Amanda. I'm determined to bring Zoe back to the real world. Tamara is alive in V-World. She's with my daughter. They are holed up together, deep inside the game. To reach them, I need a fighter. I need to get my family back. You ready? Yeah. Good boy. Good boy. What makes you think they're in these woods? The last set of co-ordinates placed her avatar here. This whole environment is Zoe's creation. I'm going to go up ahead, get some bearings. Still don't know what you need me for. With any luck, we won't. You two stay put. I assume you're not checking out his ass. I recognize that face. I don't trust him. Gods, look at these leaves. Each one is different. And this light? It's all so incredibly real, and I don't have the foggiest idea how she did it. It can't have been purely intuitive. Genitive algorithms? Stochastic processes? Now I remember why we put the lab in the basement. I'm just saying, it's one thing to write code, but what Zoe's done here is, well... It's closer to what the Gods did in the old creation myths. Whatever our daughter is, she's not a god. Gods, I hate this place. What the frak was that? Dragon Fighters of Kobol. What? Zoe's favorite book when she was a kid. Well, she's clearly expressing her rage, trying to scare us off. Or kill us. She wouldn't go that far. Would she? You know, in V-World, we could actually be on a ship like this right now. And some day, they're going to be able to zap memories of having a ship directly into your brain. I just think it's more fun to do a thing. If that's what you want. The women and men who sailed on these ships would be at sea for... Oh, gosh, a really long time. Sometimes their captains wouldn't even let them set foot in a port because they knew they'd never come back. So, they wouldn't get to see their homes for years. I wouldn't mind that. You still miss your mom a lot, huh? I guess. A ship's crew is a lot like a family. You might lose a member, and then they just bring someone else on board who could... Well, the family might change, but what's important is that it's still a family. You think I can go play in V-World? If that's all right? Yeah. Of course. Cool. Thank you. Give him time. You're wrong. You asked for proof. I found it. They cooked the books brilliantly, but there were holes for anyone willing to look closely. Don't act superior. These are good men. What they're doing, supplying these robots to the rebels, it's going to be very popular. Popular with the stratiotai, popular back home. And that makes you look bad. It's a slap in the face, Guatrau. It's Samuel and Yoseef. I know. I know they're like sons to you, but I am your actual daughter. Oh, come now. Shh. Which is why you trust me to tell you the truth when everyone else is afraid to. Especially in a matter like this, when you can't face it yourself. And the truth, Father, is that they are becoming a threat. Quick and painless. Yes, Guatrau. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Dad, there's someone at the door. It's okay, Willie, go back to your room. Stay in there. Evelyn. What? Get back upstairs, get ready to call Sam. Just do it. Oh. Frankie. Joseph. Come on in. Are you okay? Hmm? Yeah, yeah. Guatrau wants to see you. Okay, look, let me tell Eve. Just make a phone call from the car. Grab your jacket, let's go. All right. I'm just gonna be a minute. I don't want her to worry. And look at me, I can't see the Guatrau like this. Go, go. Easy. Easy. Nothing personal. Nothing personal. Joseph! Oh, Gods! Oh, Gods! Never liked that one. I'll call your brother. It's okay. I'm okay. So, do you guys really buy into this one true God stuff? I mean, not the way they're going about it, not all the killing. But underneath? Well, yeah. How exactly did you end up in a camp of die-hard monads? I didn't ask to be invited to this little party, I was drafted by my parents. But back to the question at hand... The one true God is love, love pure and simple. Love, okay, so is that why he teaches us to kill in his name? I mean, I don't care who you are, polys, monads, whatever. It seems like all they care about is killing each other. Not all of them. And the STO? Come on, our so-called teachers? You really think they speak for God, those animals? No. I don't. Well, good, Lacy. Because they're gonna kill you. What? Ignore him. Caro makes him mean. No, no, no. Reason it out. Lacy controls their robots. That threatens them. But they'll get over that. And when they do, bullet to the head. Bang. Half an hour. What? That's how it worked in my time. If I didn't call in within half an hour, another shooter was sent to follow up. We're gonna have to disappear. All of us. Head off-world. Sam, where the frak are you? All right, listen, Frankie just tried to kill me. They'll be after you, too. You know where to meet me. Ruth, could you go get Larry, wake him up, bring him to the Spaceport. Evelyn, you and Willie come with me. Where are we going? Goldie's. Sam and I kept a stash of cash and fake docs in case we ever needed to run. You should have kept them here! What are you talking about? Goldie's may be Sam's place, but any of the guys can just figure it out, Joseph. No, no. We did not know we'd be running from our own people. Don't fight! Go! Get what you need. I'll pick up the tickets and meet you at the Spaceport. Come on, let's go! Guatrau send anyone after me, safe journey. You'll forgive me, Soldier Sinclair, but I'm a little puzzled. I know you have a problem with Lacy Rand. I just want to stay out of it. Whatever it is you're going to do to her, I mean. I have no loyalty to her. My loyalty is to the Soldiers of the One, nothing else. So, you're just here to clarify. Hmm. Precision is an admirable quality in a soldier. I like it. So, let us be very precise about where you stand. Kill Lacy Rand for us. What? No, my entire point was I wanted to stay out of this, completely. At first I thought we were going to have to shut power off to half the city, but then I found out that the Graystones have their own sub-circuit. Good. Makes it easier. Exactly. So, we approach the property right through the front gate and we force our way in, not triggering any alarms. We move up the drive, not tripping any motion sensors, because, again, the power's down. Now, once we're inside the security perimeter, we have to jam anything coming off a generator, including their phones. Now, our mole at the GDD says that any calls that actually do make it to the police will be ignored, but I don't see a point in taking any chances right now. Are you sure you're going to be able to keep it together? I'm fine. So, once all the alarms are down, we just have to force our way through the front door, and the house is ours. You are not welcome. Please leave the premises immediately. I thought you shut him down. You have five seconds until I initiate action. So did I. Five, four, three, two, one... Do you hear that? Yeah, let's go! Emergency services, how may I help you? Security barricade initiated. Frak! Can you get us in? Yeah. I can get us in. We just... It's that way. Let's go, let's go, let's go. The avatar co-ordinates are at the top of this hill. So, what happens when we get face-to-face with the girls? It depends. If it comes down to them or us, there's got to be a way to slow them down or stop them, right? We should play poker some time, I might actually win my company back. What's that mean? Well, first you say there's no way you're gonna help me, then you call me back and say you'll do it for the money. I really should have asked for more. What do you want? I want to find my niece, that thing that looks like Tammy, so I can put her out of her misery and let my brother move on with his life. You show me how to kill Tammy, and I'll protect you and guide you to that creature you think is your daughter. And then... Frak, I don't know, play house with it, for all I care. But what if I don't want to help you kill Tamara? Then I blow you and your wife out of this game and you never see your daughter again. That's an interesting first offer. Let me counter. You can't buy me off, Graystone. Sweetheart, we were negotiating. Oh, yeah? I told you I didn't trust that guy. If you tell him how to kill Tamara, he'll kill Zoe, too. You don't know that! Yes, I do. How'd you survive without me all these weeks? Sam, where the frak are you? All right, listen, Frankie just tried to kill me. Frak! Frak! ...two, three. - Yes! - Here we go! Olaf, get this monitor up. Got it. Just have to decrypt and drain the Graystones' backup systems. And then, is that going to open the door? Yes, it will, if you leave me alone. Nestor. They're in V-World. I thought you had all the communications shut down. It's some type of protected circuit, I can't... Let me just focus on getting the door open. Is that my Holoband she's wearing? I can't tell. They all look the same to me. Then, why don't we just shoot her and rip it off her frakking head? I got an idea. All right. Okay. Come on, transport's going to leave without us. Yeah, I just gotta get my stash. What, you can't go 10 minutes without lighting up? No, not in this place. What are you doing? Get on the ground. No. Get down on your knees. No. Get on the ground, Lacy. No. Get on the ground! What are you doing! Stay down! What are you doing? Stay down. I'm sorry, Lacy. How far is it up that mountain? I don't know. Maybe an 11-hour walk. And Zoe can just blink and appear somewhere else in the game? Well, yes. She could have us running in circles until we're old and gray. Or one of her monsters kills us. I could try to come up with some sort of a virus to flush her out of the game. I'm just going to wait here till you're done talking crap. Well, what? What then? We're going about this all wrong. Trying to grab Zoe into your black room, chasing after her in V-World? Zoe's too much like us. She's contrary. If you chase her, she dodges. If you corner her, she lashes out. What if we invite her? Let her come on her own terms. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Finish it. It's because of the robots. I'm afraid so. Do you have anything you want to tell me? Did Clarice plant you? No. Soldier, you were doing so well. Get back! Get back! You, get back! Got his key. We can take the spare transport off-world. Yeah. Let's go, now. We're not running. We're not? Follow me. Robots, power up. We've got work to do. All right. If we do win her back, do we put her in the robot again? I've been working on it, just in case, but I can't imagine that'll keep her happy. For the time being, we have a virtual version of our house. We could meet her there, interact. Holding her will feel as real to both of you as this. But it's not real. It's useless without a body. You can make her one, can't you? Olaf! I think I'm in. Check the door! I'm here! And? - It's opening. - Oh, thank God! Wait! There's another door behind it. Of course there is. That's okay. It's okay. I think I can just input the same code sequence for the other door. I just need a minute. Gods, it's so cold. I can feel it in my bones. Can't we just take off our bands for a second, just to warm up? If we do that, we lose all the progress we've made in the game. We'd have to start over. Frak that. No way. Come on, Zoe. What's that? Whatever it is, it's not real. It's not real. It's not real. It's not real. Zoe. Frak! Step back, or I'll derez you. We're not here to hurt you. You can't hurt me. Not anymore. We just want you to come home, that's all. You don't want me, you want her. To you, I'm just spare parts. You're right. You're right, I've done a lot of damage. I see that. And I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. That's the best you got? You're gonna say something like that and I'm just gonna fall in your arms, Daddy? No, I don't expect that. Gee, you are smart. Zoe. Sweetheart. I'm sorry, do I know you? Look at me, Zoe. Look at my face. Do you remember me? Those are her memories, not mine. Look at me, Zoe, right here, right now, and tell me that you don't remember me. Yes, okay. I remember. And how does that make you feel? Hate. I hate you. I frakking hate you, you stupid, disgusting cow! Zoe. Mom, please. Just go. I hate both of you. You know where we are. We'll be waiting for you. Whenever you're ready. Always. I'll think about it. What happened? What is it? Something's draining our power. We're on solar reserves. Ah, there's been a break-in. Oh, Gods! How long do we have? Are they coming? I don't know. Well, how long do we have before they get in? Don't bother, they're jamming all the phone lines. How long, Daniel? I don't know. All right. I'm going to get close, see if anybody's in there. You know how to work this thing? Yeah. Okay, if I'm not back in 10 minutes, get Willie to the Spaceport. Don't go. You'll be okay, I promise. Okay? Be careful. Sam! Where the frak were you! He really did this. He put a hit on us. We thought he'd got you. No, I'm good, I'm good. Let's do this. You guys hang tight. Love you! Come on. Daniel, they're bypassing the failsafe. Hey! Step away! Hands up! Don't move, don't touch anything. All right. We're unarmed. Over here. We're unarmed. Move! Sit down. Sit down! Where are the bands? Over there. Where's the band you stole from us? I've hidden it somewhere where it will be publicly released if I don't check in periodically. It's being hacked and analyzed as we speak. They're lying. Search for it. It's not here. I just want to talk to you. I loved you. I thought you were special. You made Zoe. Don't talk about my daughter. Why not? I mean, I was more of a mother to her than you ever were. You sent her to die on that train. Oh, you think I led her? No. Oh, no, she led me. She was the one who talked to angels. They guided her. Zoe saw it all. She was just a kid. You didn't really know her at all, did you? Neither of you. You have all the power here. Oh, shut up! I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you. And my God will applaud me. I want to know God. What? I want God in my life. You? I'm not remotely capable of grasping the universe, but clearly there's a spirit, vastly superior to man's, which has always humbled me, and I want to know. I want to know something bigger than myself, something cleansing and forgiving of all the... Oh, come on! Of all that I've left undone. Please. Please. Sister, please. Please have mercy. Have mercy, bring me to the light. I don't want to be limited by time and space, I want to sleep well after life's fitful fever. Please. Please, show me to the one true God. Oh, come on! He's stalling! Show me to the one true God, please! Sister, please! Zoe? That's right, Clarice, it's me. Zoe! Oh, thank you. Here. Here, put this on, we're gonna link to her now. To where? Our virtual home. How far out does the water go? About half a click, and then you hit static. Not nearly as elaborate an illusion as New Cap City. I can make it bigger. Assuming that I stay. Well, you'll find it's an exact replica of the home you grew up in, with every creature comfort at your fingertips. But the big lure is the real-time clone of my entire computer network. You and I could operate in tandem, sharing data as we go. Data for what? Building you a new body. Compact, agile, with full sensory input. And with skin. A skin job. If you will. It's as good a name as any. Are you in? - Those are you. - Okay. Yeah, okay. My brother has a place you would absolutely love. You might be able to stay there for a while, on Tauron. Stay out of sight, you know? You could go fox hunting... It's been 20 minutes. They're not back yet. They're fine. He has these two dogs that work as a team, and they drive the fox towards the... Willie! Willie! Let's do this easy, huh? Where's Frankie? He's gone. Come on, Tommy, let my brother go, all right? He's got a kid. Wish I could. Willie! Go! Go! Go! Come here, Willie. Hey. It's gonna be all right. Sam! Sam! Sam! It's his hand. They hurt his hand. Willie! Hey, hey, kid! It's okay, it's all right. You saved our asses, kid. You did good. Yeah, you did. It hurts. I know, I know. I know it hurts. Okay, come here. Come here. It's okay. Wait... He's really cold, Yoseef. It's okay, buddy, it's okay. Wait a minute... Oh, my Gods! Oh, my Gods! Sam, we gotta get him to the hospital. We gotta get Willie help. Help me. It's okay, it's all right, it's okay. Joseph, let him go. Let him go, Yoseef. Let him go. Come on. Come on, kid, stay with me. - Willie... You can do it. Willie! Willie! I'm sorry, Yoseef. It's okay. Shh. Willie! Preuzeto sa www.titlovi.com
