They spelled my shit wrong. ‐ You know what that means? ‐ Means somebody fucked up. ‐ No, do you know what your name means, God? ‐ R is the first letter of your name. R is for rule. To rule is in the nature of the black man. Rules are given to those who are living the righteous way of life. And those rules are given by the king who is Allah, the only ruler there is. What's today's mathematics, God? What's today's mathematics, God? ‐ Today's mathematics is Knowledge Understanding all being born to Culture. Knowledge and Understanding allows the Asiatic Black Man to reign supreme over his cypher and share the Culture with those who want to attain the 12 jewels. Peace, God. ‐ Peace, God. This your man? ‐ This is my cousin. It's all good. ‐ Well, you better school this fake‐ass Rakeem, before he catch a beat‐down. ‐ Good, cuz? ‐ The fuck did I do to that nigga, yo? ‐ You calling yourself Prince Rakeem. You gotta know the knowledge behind that shit. The Gods take that shit seriously. ‐ Hey, I don't understand a word that man said, a'ight? All I know is, shit sounded like some religious bullshit. ‐ It ain't even like that. It's not about faith or belief. There ain't no mysteries to God. You, the black man, are a God. Once you gain knowledge, it's gonna wipe away that fear in you. You know what I mean? Build your confidence. Look at Just‐Ice. Any club he walks into, any stage he steps on is his and his only. That's because the man got knowledge of self. This shit is real. Want the Lessons? ‐ Yeah. ‐ Say the word, son. ‐ All right, man, yeah. Take a lesson or whatever. ‐ I'll give you something to read, but if you want to learn, you have to build with the Gods. A'ight? ‐ Hey, yo, so I was thinking, maybe tonight, we perform Pass the Bone. ‐ Together? ‐ Hell, yeah. ‐ Yo, I got my shit. You got your shit. But me, you, and Ason together up there, we stronger together. You know what I'm saying? You remember them Jamaicans at Park Villa. ‐ No doubt. Hey, when we form like Voltron, ain't no stopping us. ‐ Yes, that's what I'm sayin'. Mic check. One, two. Mic check, one, two, one, two. Hey. Turn me up in the monitors. I can't hear myself. Only the center one's wired. ‐ Yo, rewire the other monitors, motherfucker. And don't give me some bullshit excuse, 'cause I know yo' ass can do it. This shit again? ‐ What? Hey, speak up, motherfucker. Okay, give me a couple minutes. I'll take care of it. ‐ Which one of these do you want to wear for tonight? ‐ Oh, shit. Yo, what happened to my Army fatigue joint I had on the other night? ‐ Ask your backup dancer. ‐ Hey, yo, cuz. Yo, that's my shit. Yo, that's my jacket. ‐ My jacket now, nigga. ‐ A'ight. ‐ Yo, they about to have you out there looking like Big Bird in this thing. ‐ Hell, no. I feel like I'm fucking with what I have on right now, you know, this Carhartt, this Champion hoodie. Shit's more me. ‐ Hey. Hey, but thank you. Yo, what's up? I need room to do the Ason slide, cuz. I come right up to the edge. ‐ Can't you just do it, like, five feet that way? ‐ What, you my choreographer now? ‐ Hey, yo, yo, it's all good. Hey, guess what? ‐ What's up? Yo, tonight, we performing Pass the Bone. ‐ Hoo‐hoo! A'ight? Yo, I need us‐‐ I need all of us to be on the same page. So I'ma finish up this microphone check, I'ma catch y'all niggas backstage. ‐ Oh, word, you know that's my joint too, cuz. You know that. ‐ Spoke to Raymond about the shirts. Hopefully we'll have new ones before the tour ends. ‐ Hope you got your money back. ‐ Yeah. And you're going on first tonight. ‐ Wait, what? ‐ Yeah, apparently, Naughty just left Dallas. They're gonna be late. Might not even make the show. ‐ Why do I have to go on first? I mean, that's like performing for an empty crowd. Nobody even be here for the opener, yo. ‐ You want to ask Just‐Ice if he would do it instead? ‐ Can't we just ask the DJ to spin until this shit pack up? ‐ Look, Ra, stop sweatin' the small shit. You think I would've signed you if I didn't think you were a star? Look, so your single came out less than a month ago and look where you're at already. All you gotta do is focus and put on a good show. That's it. Doesn't matter if there's two people today. Tomorrow there's gonna be 200 and then 2,000. You're on your way, man. Trust me. ‐ All right, man. Let me get back to this microphone check. I'ma holler at you later. Hey, yo, yo. Mic check, one, two. One, two. Mic check. Mic check, one, two, one, two.

Come on. ‐ Wait, so y'all‐‐ y'all reaching out to new producers now, yo? When I been showing you what I can do? ‐ I know, I know, it's a tough sell. How many rappers you know producing their own albums? ‐ EPMD, yo. Brand Nubian. Tribe. Yo, Naughty's on Tommy Boy, and they got‐‐ they got Kay Gee producing shit. ‐ I'm talking solo acts. ‐ What's the difference, Dre? ‐ Hey, Fortunato. The director. Hey. The man with the magic plan. ‐ Hey, man, it's great to meet you. ‐ Hey. I'm not gonna lie. Feel like this is all‐‐ this ain't me, man. ‐ Nah. No, no, don't say that. It's gonna be great. Trust me. And Dre said you love movies. ‐ These ain't the movies I was talking about. Y'all couldn't get a movie theater in Staten Island? Showcase the hood? ‐ We're gonna mix‐‐ ‐ Yo, come on, man. ‐ We're gonna mix some of your urban flavor with that classic movie star feel. ‐ Hey, listen. All this fancy shit ain't me. A'ight? I need something real. Something authentic. When people see me, I need them to know who I am and where I come from, yo. ‐ There he is. ‐ That's all I'm saying. ‐ Star of the show. ‐ That's all I'm saying. ‐ Hey, isn't this amazing? It's so classic and cinematic. Hey. I just got out of wardrobe. You're gonna look great. All right, I'm gonna steal Rakeem for a second. Come on. Hey. We haven't talked since you left. How was the tour? Did you have fun? ‐ It was a'ight. I mean, I think we rocked it. That Carolina record signing, though, that shit was fucked up. ‐ Yeah, I know. Okay, and it's our bad, and we take full responsibility, but, honestly, I think the new version's better. Oh, you don't look convinced. ‐ Yeah, well, if y'all like it... look, all I'm saying is, this ain't my vibe, man. I do have some ideas for the video‐‐ ‐ Okay, okay, look, I get your skepticism. I know you're asking yourself, I mean, "What does this white woman know about hip‐hop anyway," am I right? ‐ I didn't say all that. ‐ It's okay. But we do happen to know what works and what sells. All right, when I started at Tommy Boy, I was the only employee. In fact, I don't even think we were a label yet. It was just me and Tom in a cramped apartment. But I had an eye and ear for talent and Tom believed in me, and ten years later, look at our track record. I had a hand in every single one of those videos that we did for our artists. You remember Ladies First, right? ‐ Yeah. Latifah's dope. ‐ Right, okay, so you remember those clips of South Africa and the struggle to end apartheid? Those were controversial, and they were debated. But I fought for those because we believe that all of our videos should represent our artists, whether it's, I don't know, Me Myself and I or The Humpty Dance. ‐ Shit. Y'all got me looking like Humpty on my shit. ‐ I don't see it that way. No, I think it's fun and it shows your personality. Listen, Rakeem, you have a style that's not like any other artist that we have on our roster, and I think that this video is gonna showcase that. Now, this is Chelsey, and this is Emily, and they're gonna take great care of you. ‐ Y'all got me in a penguin suit? ‐ Well, it's just for the stage scene. It's not for the whole video. ‐ Monica. ‐ It's sophisticated. And in a couple of months, when your video is all over MTV Raps, Rap City, Video Music Box, you're gonna love it. All right? I promise. ‐ Try them on. You can go change behind there. Hey, Monica. I was thinking... Look, I know you guys are looking for producers, but I really think I should do the beats on my album. I did the single, both versions, y'all liked that. You heard Pass the Bone. And I have a few more that I could play for you if... Monica? What do you... ‐ Come here. Let me help you. Can you tuck in for me, please? ‐ Yeah. Yo, where did she go again? ‐ She just went out. She's gonna talk to production. Tuck in. It looks nice. ‐ How's it feel? ‐ Feels pretty tight. ‐ It's supposed to be a little tight, sweetie. Arms up. Turn around. How do you like the color? Follow me, this way. I'll deal with that. Braids look good. Just gonna tighten 'em up. ‐ That's pretty tight. ‐ I know, I know. Excuse me, there's a friend here to see you, over at craft services. ‐ Yeah, that's my boy, D‐Lover. Yo, I invited him. Yo, can you‐‐ one second, please. ‐ Hold on. Turn around for me. Arms. ‐ Thank you. ‐ Thank you. ‐ Hey, yo, that's my brother over there. All right, can you make sure he doesn't come over here for about a couple of minutes? Thank you. Hey, yo, what up, nigga? What you doing over here, stealing food? ‐ What's good, son? ‐ Yeah, boy. ‐ Ah. Look at you, looking all proper and shit. ‐ Real proper. ‐ Yo, they told me you was having a video shoot and all, but I didn't know it was gonna be all this, son... yo. ‐ It's crazy, right? ‐ Word. ‐ Yo, who the fuck told you about the shoot? ‐ Your man Gary. Or Justice, or Genius, or whatever‐‐ I can't keep up with y'all niggas, always changing your names and shit. Change your name more than I change my damn drawers, son. ‐ Hey, I believe that, nigga. I believe that shit, with your stink ass. ‐ Yo, he played me that Pass the Bone joint too. ‐ Oh, you fuck with it? ‐ Son, that shit sound nice, kid. Word is bond. Yo, appreciate that shout‐out too. ‐ Got you. ‐ No, it's, like, dope. That's the idea? Shit don't look like where we came from, son. ‐ It's not my idea at all, but it is what it is, man. ‐ That don't sound like the Bobby I grew up with. ‐ No, yo, hey, I remember us. We was kids, you know, posing for album covers and shit. ‐ Word is bond. ‐ Look at what it is now. You still writing that shit? ‐ It's whatever, you know, I ain't got time for all that. Son, you know a nigga be busy and all that. So what's up with that‐‐ what's up with that Robin Leach? ‐ Yo, Robin Leach? ‐ The Rich and Famous tour. Show me around and all that, son. ‐ Shit... ‐ Hey, yo. I see you got your groupies and shit, huh? What the fuck you just said, son? ‐ You know you been doing that shit, bum‐ass motherfucker, what up? Jump, nigga. Jump, nigga. ‐ Yo, this not even the time and place for all that, son. ‐ Yeah, so my crib is the place, nigga? My fucking crib is the place? You ain't leaving this motherfucker. You ain't walking out this motherfucker. I promise you, man. ‐ Please. Please, yo. He gonna be in the video, all right? ‐ Nigga, fuck you, nigga.

Huh? ‐ Nigga, you know I fuck with both of y'all. ‐ Hey, yo, why the fuck you even ask me here, son? What, you trying to set me up or some shit? ‐ Now, why would I do that? ‐ I don't know. ‐ Nah, nobody trying to set you up. I didn't even invite him, a'ight? Yo. He just came by himself. Besides, man, yo, look at this shit. Look at this shit. Fuck all that beef between y'all, yo. This is what's important. Getting paid to make music. All that street shit is over. ‐ May be over for you. Prince Rakeem. You been doing whatever the fuck you want. Bounce for a couple months, on the road and shit. All happy‐go‐lucky. Meanwhile, I'm here. Left behind. Putting in work. ‐ Yo, you could've came on that tour with me, man. You know that. ‐ To do what? Be a fucking‐‐your backup dancer or some shit? Yo, get the fuck out of here, son. ‐ You was the one who gave up rapping. That was‐‐that was on you. ‐ Nigga, because I gotta eat, right? Put food on the table for my fam! I'm in the streets hustling every day and every fucking night. Meanwhile, you here, all buddy‐buddy with these Park Hill niggas like ain't shit happen. Nigga, fuck that. Shit ain't over till it's over. Know I mean? Them niggas still gotta answer for what they did. ‐ Then what, D? One of Power's people, they gonna peel you off. ‐ Power, yo, yo, Power and that nigga shot up my crib. Mm‐hmm. Where my moms and my brothers stay. Darius and Darren. Know I mean? ‐ Yeah. ‐ And if niggas was fuckin' with you and yours, I would have your back. No question. So what up? ‐ Yo, D. You and I both know, the only reason why Power did that shit is because you came after his people first. Yo, after 'Vine told you not to. ‐ Yo, I don't give a‐‐ I don't give a fuck what 'Vine say. I don't give a fuck what 'Vine say. I don't give a fuck what nobody say, you feel me? I peel that nigga wig back right now, nigga. ‐ Props. ‐ Right fucking now. You feel me?

Let's go on the bell. ‐ Here you go. This is perfect. ‐ Yo, what is... ‐ Look, give me‐‐ give me one take with it. It looks great. Trust me. ‐ Yo. ‐ These too. ‐ Test, test, one, two, one, two. One, two, one, two. ‐ Turn that shit all the way up, a'ight? All these levels right here. ‐ Uh, you have to leave, like, 20% headroom, man. You have them all the way up, you're gonna get distortion. You don't want it peaking over zero. ‐ Nah, man. This is how I want it, a'ight? This is part of the sound. Put this shit all the way up. Mix that shit gritty and raw, know what I'm sayin'? Gives it that raw shit. ‐ You want that, like, punk rock sound, right? Like Sex Pistols. Exactly. ‐ Yo. ‐ Cool, man. I dig it. ‐ That shit sound kind of ill, though, cuz. You should've threw that shit on my album. ‐ Yo, this nigga got jokes now, huh? ‐ Know what I'm sayin'? ‐ Yo. ‐ Talk different when you get money, yo. ‐ You know it. You know it. ‐ Yo, I heard they put you in that Bobby new video, though. ‐ Know what I mean? ‐ Look at him. ‐ Yo, that shit was mad fun.

Now, Bobby, you know I've been waiting on this moment my whole life. Let me get that first verse. ‐ Hold on, son. Relax your limb, son. First verse? ‐ Hey, look, it don't matter if it's first or last, a'ight? I want all of y'all niggas to try to compete with each other. Try to outshine each other. But at the same time, we coming together. Hit them niggas with that Wu‐Tang sword style. Slicing niggas with sharp tongues. ‐ You know what I'm saying? Wu‐Tang. Nobody fucking with the Clan.
