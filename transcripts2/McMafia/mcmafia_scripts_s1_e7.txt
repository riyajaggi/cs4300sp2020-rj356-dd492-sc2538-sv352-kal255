 I want information on their personal lives. How close he is to each of them. What kind of security does your family have in place? Probably not enough. I'm going to see if Mr Godman can help. I want to give you my notice. Allon and I served in the IDF together for many years. Don't worry, Mr Godman. We'll be armed. Masha is pregnant with Papa's child. We'll give you £20,000 a month to bring up your baby somewhere else.

 Maybe you should move out for a while. What? His girlfriend moved out of their house. It looks like they broke up. I broke up with my girlfriend to try and protect her. I'm Sylvie and this is Alba. What a beautiful name. We should have a drink when my nanny's back. That'd be lovely. I need to check on Rebecca. He knows there's a swimming pool in her apartment block. I never told him that. They wanted information. Anything I could tell them.

 I'm sure everything will be fine. Better be. I'm pregnant. She's in surgery. I thought if I hurt Vadim's business, if I made him look bad in front of his associates, then I could protect you. Did Rebecca know? No. You protect me? Don't shout at him. You say nothing. He did it for you. He did it for your brother. This is the life you made for him. This is the life I made for him. In London. With money. With education. Safe. I protect my family, not you! Please stop it! Come. You break off with Semiyon Kleiman. No more business. You have to make peace with Vadim. But you'll have to beg on your knees. The Kremlin doesn't want problems with the UK government. I have a contact in the Russian Embassy. You need to talk to him. == Synced & corrected by MaxPayne == You'd broken up with your boyfriend just before the attempt on your life. That's right. I assume you were aware his family are political exiles here. That they had a history of involvement with Russian crime syndicates. I was aware of it. But that had nothing to do with Alex. And as far as you were aware, his own business dealings were completely legitimate? Completely. May I ask why you broke up? Because I didn't love him any more. Federal Intelligence Agency, Moscow She's ready for you. I should hope so. I've waited forty minutes. Did you know about this? No. You know you can buy firewood at the store. They chop it too small. When's granny coming? Next week. Why? My friends are giving me a leaving party. Am I invited? As long as you give a speech. I'm going to miss you. You're only going to Paris. I'll visit every weekend. Please don't. See who it is. It's Ilya. Don't worry. I'll call him back. Oleg! - Oleg. - Dima. You've grown since our last meeting. I've not grown at all, believe me. Not one promotion in ten years. What makes you think I can help you? This is my son Alex. You remember him from when he was a student. Pleased to meet you. He wants to talk to you. Here's an interesting article. I hope you like it. Wow. You know, there are a lot of people back in Russia who are really impressed with, er, what you've achieved. To take on a man like Vadim using a small bank in the center of London, that requires intelligence. Not very intelligent to put myself and my family in this position. Vadim obviously has very influential friends, but he also has his critics. Especially now, when his profits don't exactly match the inconvenience they cause. Despite what people think, we do not want any problems with the British. In a world without conflicts... We don't profit. Don't you think so? I agree. I know your father. I'll try to help you make peace with Vadim. Thank you. I'll talk to my friends in Moscow. I can't promise you anything, but one thing is certain... No one's happy to see anti-Russian headlines in newspapers. It's rubbish. Absolutely. No. Don't drink the tea. She doesn't want to see you right now. How is she? They're going to keep her in another couple of weeks. She'll be okay. Come on. There's a lot of pressure on me from my boss. I doubt our government will cooperate with a British investigation. But they want this feud to end now. Don't give any excuse to your enemies. My enemies? Okay, our enemies. Don't give them an excuse. Do as they ask. He's a boy. He can't hurt you. In Russia, all the government factions are competing but quietly, undercover. Everyone wants their slice of the pie. I had my contacts, but they turned their backs on me. Vadim took almost everything from me. If he's agreed to meet you, it means he's in trouble. And that makes him dangerous. This meeting... You trust your friend Oleg? I have no choice. Where do they want to meet? Istanbul What should I do, Papa? Istanbul Outside. It's good to see you. It's good to see you, too. How we've come far. How have you been? Things have settled down a little. I'm glad. I heard about your fiancée. I'm sorry. She will recover fully? I hope so. Alex. I want you to know, I am going to agree to everything they ask. I don't care about the money. I'll give them everything they want as long as they leave you and your family in peace. It will be all right, I promise. There is pressure on all of us to reach an understanding. I think we agree things have gone too far. Mr Kleiman, I suggest we begin with the discussion points here. Mumbai first. Through the front companies listed here, you have been financing their metal shipping company and its subsidiary office at the port. Er, Hungersky Export Ltd, owned by Vadim Kalyagin, also has interest in the port. We propose you put your partners in Mumbai at his disposal, should he need them. In addition... A container shipment, Srikkanth Steel, was lost in transit. It is our hope that you or your partners will provide compensation for this. Hmm. The next point deals with, er, various companies in the Czech Republic. Forgive me. Traffic was very bad. Er, before we proceed... I have some conditions of my own... Uh, which require no signature, only your word. I accept full responsibility for my actions against Mr Kalyagin's business interests. My young friend here acted simply as an accountant. The threats against him and his family are unwarranted. And I hope they cease. Perhaps Mr Kalyagin and Mr Godman should discuss this matter alone? It wasn't my decision to meet. I know. Everyone tells me I have nothing to fear from you. But I'm not so sure. You overestimate me. I underestimated you the first time. And look where we are now. Even, I hope. If we were even, you would be in the hospital bed instead of your fiancée. And your uncle still would be alive. I'm willing to put that aside if it keeps my family safe. You've told me that once before. Why should I believe you now? Because I've learned the cost. That, I believe. You know, I always told my daughter, my wife died of cancer. But the truth is, she was killed for a mistake I made. I haven't spent a completely happy day since. If you choose this life, you have to be ready to give up everything. I'm not. That's why I'm here. Then... That makes us even. - Joseph. - Sir. It's good to see you. - You, too. - How are you finding London? Well, we all miss you in Israel. Any messages you'd like to pass along? No, sir. Take good care of my young friend. It's good that we made peace. Don't worry about Lyudmilla. I said I'd take care of it. So they agreed? I hope so. You wish to speak to me? I wanted to make my position clear. You made your position clear this morning when you signed the papers I asked. And I give you my word, I will keep to our arrangement. If you have any trouble, it won't come from me. Please, Mr Kleiman, I'm a simple man. If something happens, I don't want it laid at my door. You should be aware that I'm not the only patron Mr Godman has. They told me at the flower store these don't need much water. The nurses will love you. How long are you here for? I leave tomorrow for the south of France. Good for you. You should come and stay when you're better. Have you seen Alex? Have you? No. I wanted to wish you a safe journey, Mr Godman. Thank you. You fly straight back to London? - Yes. - Not so far. Maybe we will see each other in Moscow next time. Your father, too. I hope that can be arranged. I'm not so popular with our authorities right now, but I'll do my best. Tell your father that his friend Veniamin will be happy to see him. Hmm? I bought three boxes for myself and, er... One for you. - Token gift. - Thank you. Haci Bekir is supposed to be the best Turkish Delight in the world. I'm sorry for what happened between us. Water under the bridge. And maybe your Mexican friends can make me some money from those ships. I'll see you soon, my friend. I'm sorry, too. Mama. Pass the mayonnaise. Mama, too much mayonnaise is bad for you. At my age, what's mayonnaise going to do to me? Pass it to me. To Rebecca. Mmm. Rebecca. To Rebecca. Vadim said he'd help me go back to Moscow? They're making him. His bosses have ordered him. I tell you, my friend Oleg knows everyone in Moscow. I'll take you back with me. I want you to be proud of your country. Who was your friend Veniamin? Huh? Who told you about Veniamin? Uncle Boris mentioned him, the name just stuck in my head. Veniamin wasn't my friend. He was a small-time crook in Moscow. What happened to him? They cut off his head and buried him under asphalt. What did he do wrong? In Russia, we live according to a code. He didn't stand by his word. Now, when you threaten to kill someone you say... Veniamin... Will be happy to see you. Sleep well, Mama. Goodnight, son. I don't want anyone else to know. Not even Ilya. Just you and I. Hmm? - Yes? - I need to see you. I have some important visitors right now. I don't know if I can get away. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't urgent. Vadim went to Istanbul. He did everything you asked. How much of his money would someone find in your account... if they were to investigate? Who's asking? I'm interested. You know as well as I do how many different factions we have in this country. It isn't just what happened in London. It's Mumbai. Prague. His enemies know about his weaknesses. Everyone knows Vadim and I are old friends. We grew up together. He was my commander in Afghanistan. I'm godfather to his daughter. You haven't answered my question. You haven't answered mine. I'm looking out for you as well as the integrity of this department. The only money I have in my account... is what this department pays me. I'm not paranoid. It was a threat. It was Vadim telling me it isn't over. I'm sorry to hear that. Like I said, we're ready to offer you any protection we can. I don't want protection. I had protection and they still got to Rebecca. I want to meet your partners. I have a proposition for them. My partners are grateful to you for facilitating the lease of Mr Kleiman's ships. But they already have what they want from you. They need ports as well as ships. Spain is no longer a safe point of entry for you. Nor is France. Nor is Holland. You need another gateway into Europe for your product. Right now, you don't have access to Russia because of Vadim. But he has enemies in Moscow who have different ideas. How do you know this? Through a contact of my father's, at the Embassy here. You're not a drug dealer, Alex. Not a dealer. A broker. And I'm not doing this for profit. I'm doing this to survive. If you give me the authority to represent you, I can try and open a back channel in which you can negotiate. Has your contact agreed to this? For the right amount of money, I'm sure he will. I'll talk to my partners. But they're gonna ask me why you. Because I'm Russian, and they're not. And because they have nothing to lose. That's a Shishkin. His painting At the Edge of a Pine Forest sold for a million pounds at Sotheby's. Mmm. I'm not interested in the cost, darling. - Is it okay if I look? - Of course, madam. Silly girl. They think I'm an idiot because of my accent. - You have a boyfriend, Jenny? - Yes, ma'am. You know how many men in this city I could have had affairs with? Lots, I'm sure. I'm an idiot. I fall in love with the same man all my life. Masha! Could I ask you to keep the noise down? My baby's asleep. Oh. I'm so sorry. I am... A friend of Masha. Masha's moved out. I'm not paranoid. It's a warning. If your boss is warning you, she's on your side. I'm not talking about myself. They're after your empire. If they want to get rid of me, what can I do? We all become unnecessary. Isn't it a bit early for you to go? Hmm? You stick to your friends, you still have them. Listen to advice. Behave well. And don't give them an excuse. Thank you, mother. Is this how you treat your mother? Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Good evening, sir. It's good to see you. Come. Señores, Alex Godman. Guillermo Alegre. Victor Hernandez, Rafael Portillo. Forgive us, Mr Godman, Victor and I have a dinner appointment. Hope to see you again another time. I hope so. Antonio speaks very highly of you, Alex. We are grateful for your help with Mr Kleiman's fleet. - Can I get you a drink? - Just some water, please. Are you Russian or half Russian? My parents are both Russian, but I was raised here. I hope I don't offend you, but my dealings with your fellow countrymen haven't always been successful. Unfortunately, that is often the case. We tried to do some business in St. Petersburg, but your friend, Vadim, went with one of our competitors. People think of us as a single cartel but we are not a monolith. It's the same in Russia. There are many rival factions... Which is what I wanted to talk to you about today. Right now, there's more competition than ever. Not just among the syndicates, but within the government agencies that protect them. Yeah. That's why it's so hard to do business in your country. You don't know who's in charge, who has authority, who's trying to cheat you. That's where I hope, I can be useful. I'm Russian. I have a legitimate financial base here in London and a background in the kind of business that we are talking about. I know your father has a background in our business, but from what Antonio tells me, he's been retired for... - Fifteen years. - Fifteen years. And your own experience is in finance. I'm not asking for a partnership or a percentage, sir. All I'm proposing to do is, speak to a high level contact on your behalf. It costs me nothing for you to speak to someone. So I have your confidence? My confidence means very little. I've sat with you for a few minutes and I like you. If someone picks up the phone and asks, "Does this young man speak for you?" I say, "Sure." The problems start if I lose my money. In banking, when you introduce someone to someone else, and deal goes wrong, people are upset but no one gets hurt. In my business, it's different. I understand. There's something else you need to understand. It doesn't matter how smart you are, when reason comes up against force, force always wins. I'm not here because I can afford an Armani suit. I'm here because I can afford him, him and him. You have my blessing. But unless you're serious, my blessing won't protect you. I have a small gift for you. Thank you for your help. Go get Lyudmilla out. I'll manage on my own for a while. What will you do? Is that Natasha? No, that's Sonya. Remember they look alike. You were a baby too. So what? Where are you? No, just watch him for now. How do you know what I feel? You think I betrayed your mother? You think I don't love her? I know you do. Then, why do you do this to me? You and your sister. It wasn't Katya's fault. She was your friend. She was your first woman. And you send her away like... You're the one who turned her into a whore. Katya. Who are you? What right do you have to judge her? You're no one. I was happy with her. We're protecting Mama. Your mother knew. She didn't know she was pregnant. It's not possible. Oh, it's possible. There's still life in the old dog. Why didn't you tell me? What would you have done? What did you say to Masha? We told her to leave our family alone and take her bloody baby with her. Shut the hell up, you idiot. I saved my life! I saved my life! What, you're all grown up now? You're the big boss? Don't you dare touch him! Don't you dare! It's my house. I can do anything that I want. Then tell your wife, if you're such a big man! Tell your wife to her face what you've done to our family! - Papa, no. - Don't touch me! What's he done? Oksana... I can explain. Take a look at yourself, you're drunk. Don't touch me. Idiot. You okay? Get dressed, we have to go. Wait until the morning, then say she ran away. If you say anything before then I'll come back and kill you. Where are we going? Airport. I need you to sign these. What? The real estate documents I told you about in Spain. There's also a couple of accounts I'd like to put in your name. Why do I need to sign them now? You're going away. Are you in trouble? I'm always in trouble. I thought you went to Istanbul to sort things out? I did. Then why now? It would put my mind at rest. Mmm. Thank you, for seeing me again. Vadim has left me no choice, I've had to turn to other friends. And what do these friends want from me? It's your insights that my clients are interested in. They are eager to do business in Russia and they'd be grateful for any advice or introductions. The last time we met, you indicated that there were certain factions within the security services who are no longer happy with the way Vadim does things. He was right to be nervous about you then. I went to Istanbul in good faith. But I have reason to believe Vadim won't keep his side of the bargain. Listen... Even if I were to put you in touch with someone, that will take a large incentive for them to risk going up against Vadim. And of course, there'd be no guarantee. I just want the opportunity to make my case. Okay. I'll talk to my friend. If he's willing to meet, would you be prepared to go to Moscow? Papa? Hi, Papa. I'm sorry. You did it for your mother, I know. Oleg called me. He said he'd seen you. Yes. You are going to Moscow. When I hear back from him. I thought this was finished. Not for Vadim. Do you understand? In Moscow, they kill you! Do you understand? They will kill me here, too. I don't want Mama or Katya to get hurt. I should look after the family. It's not your fault, Papa. Who does Oleg want you to meet? He hasn't told me yet. You can't make deals with these people. This is the only way. Papa, you have to trust me. You are my son. I love you. But, you are still young for... I'll be fine. The most important thing is Mama and Katya. I still have friends in Moscow. I'll talk to them for you... tell them to look after my son. Thank you. Do it. Just the Godman boy. You are the only person in Moscow I trust. Whatever you have to do, however much it takes, I'll pay. I need to protect my son. It's okay. See you outside. - Hey. - Hi. My mother and father send their love. Tell them, I'm sorry, I couldn't see them when they came to visit. Thank them for the flowers. Let me guess which is theirs. How long are they keeping you here for? Hopefully I'll be out next week. Thank you for what you said to the police. - When I asked you to move out... - Alex, don't. - I wanted to keep you safe. - Here, I am. There you go again. You can be so convincing. I was in trouble. I don't want you to be in trouble. It's so easy to forget that you grew up in a tiny little flat in Moscow. That you were a rough little boy with no money. No education. And then everything changed. And then, you got rich. And they sent you here to learn, to pretend to be civilized. But you are not. You've got manners and you do some of the right things, but that's not who you are. I don't expect you to forgive me. That's not why I came. I would have forgiven you, sooner or later. But because of you, I lost my baby. And I can't forgive you for that. What? You should have told me. Well, I have now. - Well, I... - No... I'm tired. Go. I need to go to sleep. I spoke to some friends about the London shooting. The British don't want a diplomatic row. They won't pressure us. It'll be fine. I wrote five pages but don't worry... I won't read it all. She's not just my daughter... she's my friend... my companion and someone I look up to. I just adore her. Aw! You should count your blessings. Life's not so bad. Have you seen Natasha? She went outside. Look at you girls. Let's get to know each other. What? What do you want? Have you been drinking? Does your father know? Natasha. No one's bothering you. Please go on your way. Natasha... Natasha... Natasha... Natasha... Natasha... Natasha... Call an ambulance! Natasha! An ambulance! What? Tell me. Final call for flight 337 to Moscow, please make your way to Gate 6 as the flight is about to close. Alex, Alex, it's me. Call me please, it's urgent!
