 I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I was educated at a private school in England, business school in America. I run my own firm in the City. I'm very happy with my life. I have a friend in Israel. He's very interested in investing. Vadim is still alive. The funds under investigation include Drake Clayterman, Walkers Naylor, Cotton Capital. Where the hell is this coming from? What does it take to corrupt you?

 Are you afraid? Get away from the door, Mama. Vadim assumes that your father tried to kill him, too. Neither you, your family, nor your father are safe. I'm a banker, not a gangster. These wars are fought in the boardrooms, not on the street. And you, Mr. Godman, are you harmless? Next. Purpose of your visit? Hotel work. I'm a beauty therapist. Hi. Lyudmilla? Tarek. I work with Elena.

 - Nice to meet you. - To meet you. This is Mido. Did you get her message? I haven't checked my phone. It's OK. She's working late tonight, so you'll meet her at the hotel. Mido, take... So, you had a long flight? - Four hours. - That's OK. It's much warmer here than Moscow. So, you see over there? That's the pyramids. So we're in Giza now. It's very small, no? Is the hotel far? 15 minutes. We're here. You go with these men now. Where? - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - -- www.Addic7ed.com -- Papa, do you think maybe Frank should drive? Do you see car behind us? They've been there since Windsor. - Papa, this is our exit. - Yeah. We'll need to disclose the property's history. It shouldn't affect the price, but some buyers may be put off. Yeah, of course. We've had the room professionally cleaned. We've left the furniture where it was. We weren't quite sure what you wanted to do with it. Papa, do you have the key? - Da? - Da. With half a million, I can bribe officials in Chembur, Versova, - Thane Creek, but the main port is... - No, it has to be the main port. That's Chopra's supply route to Vadim. I piss on Benny Chopra's mother, but without cash I can't take the port away from him. How much would you need? I'm a Muslim. In this country, every dollar is 50 cents for me. He has the police in his pocket, City Hall, the Shiv Sena and the... I'll give you 500,000 a month to bribe those same officials and to disrupt Chopra's operations at the port. I want his consignments checked, his contraband seized and his cargo stolen. I respect you very much, Semiyon Bhai. - And would like us to part as friends. - Mmm-hmm? But I can't fight Benny Chopra without more money. Thank you for taking the time to see me. What? You should have some fun. Everything OK? Let's hope Prague is easier. This is the land of the no. They haggle, they "No, no, no," they walk away, then return to the table to renegotiate. He forgot his phone. Of course he did. Forgive me, I was talking so much I forgot my phone. Dilly, please, sit down. I've been thinking, perhaps I can give you better terms and help you with your cash flow. Kleiman's casinos and nightclubs are a concern. His position in the Knesset means we need to be vigilant about any conflict of interest. But we can sign off on him? It will make a big difference. He'll replace all the capital we've lost and invest in a new fund, as well. Just something small. He has some investment ideas that aren't the right fit for the main fund, so I thought we'd set up something separate. If it pans out, we can open it up to new capital. OK. Send me the details. Shukran. Mido. - Good evening, Mr. Godman. - Good evening, Daniel. Forgive me, sir, but could you please have a word with your father about his music? Mr. Al-Majid's complained again. Sure. Hi, Papa. Rebecca. I'm very glad to see you. - You, too. - Darling. Flowers for me? - Of course. And chocolates, too. - OK. Why are you here? You invited us. For dinner. Your mother never tells me anything. Ssh. Where is Mama? Sit down, Rebecca. It's me, Mama. I've had enough of the stupid man. I'm sorry. He lost his brother, but I can't go on like this. Ssh. Mama, it's OK. He has to be a man. He can't be a child all the time. Masha, you went out with Alex years ago. You have to move on. I know... But what does he see in her? She's so bloody British! I bolted the window so he couldn't get up here. I found the key. You have to help me with Papa. It's my fault. Are you coming for dinner? Speak in English. Becky doesn't understand Russian. It's rude. Papa, did Uncle Boris ever ask you advice on his business? Niet. No-one's going to come after you, Papa. Papa, did you know a Semiyon Kleiman when you were in Russia? Semiyon? Nothing. Uncle Boris mentioned him. - A cobra. - Cobra! Cobra. Prague is the gateway to the Russian market. That's why it interests me So far, there's only one-way traffic through the gate. All this is Russian controlled. We can't even operate in our own city. The clubs, bars, girls... Everything from here to the river is Klimov's. - And Vadim's. - Of course. Russians. Drinking our beer. Pimping our women. Like '89 never happened. How long have you worked for Mr. Reznik? Since I left the police. 2005. Are you happy? I'm Czech. We're never happy with the boss. Smell. Real stuff, fake stuff. Tell me the difference. This used to be tractor factory and now Chinese make tractor, I make perfumes. Mr. Chanel No.5, that's me. Come. La Liga, Serie A, Premiership. You like football? Maccabi Tel Aviv. I find you. Sometimes they make mistake so Messi play for Madrid. Free transfer. This is all very impressive, Mr. Reznik. Have you had a chance to consider my offer? Sure. I'd like to finance your operation so you can compete with the Russians. With Vadim Kalyagin. I don't like Russians, but they run this country. Before war, after war, now. It is big risk. I need deposit. Five million euros. So I know you have money, and I have serious partner. Then we talk. Hey. You haven't sent the details on the Global Fund. The fund you set up for Kleiman? Oh, don't worry. There's nothing going on with it right now. I'll send you something as soon as there is. Are you OK? Yeah, sure. We're back on track. I meant you, not the fund. I'm fine. You never got back to me. I'm sorry. I should have called. Still landed on your feet anyway. For now. Don't even have to change the name of your company. So, Mr. Godman, who did you persuade to invest? A couple of investors who saw through the rumours. But we'd always welcome more. Sydney Bloom. The ethical face of capitalism. Do you know how he made his money? Stripping down African ports. Time to circulate. Well, the Sydney Bloom Foundation is setting up a guarantee facility of 3 billion for small businesses in developing markets. Of course, some of those funds will be siphoned off through corruption, but that's a risk we have to bear. Hello? I need you to meet me in Prague next week. What for? I'm having issues with the Czechs. I need you to explain our business proposal to them more clearly. What issues? They've withdrawn the token of goodwill we sent them and now they won't return my calls. Just keep an eye on everything for a minute. - I'll be right back. - Yes, sure. It's a test. The man in charge is a gambler. He's seeing what he can get away with. There are two ways I can deal with this. Either I take the money back by force, or we convince them that what they took is nothing compared to what they can make. I agreed to move your capital for you. That's it. Alex, I wouldn't ask unless it was important. This man Reznik knows nothing about finance, but there are others around him who do. I need you to convince them, like you convinced me. I'll introduce you as my lawyer, you explain how they benefit. There's nothing to worry about. Prague is as important to Vadim as Mumbai. The counterfeit and smuggling business are worth millions. If you want to hurt him and protect your family, this is what you have to do. I have to go. Give me a few days and I'll go over the numbers. I'll give you an answer. OK. Good to speak to you, too. Bye. Sorry, I had to find a quiet place to take the call. You certainly came a long way. I could kill that arsehole. - Who? - Alan Raynott. You seemed to handle him pretty well. I don't know why he gets to me so much. Even the way he says my name... "GOD-man." He's just pissed off you turned him down. Come on, we should get you back in there. Who was that on the phone? It was just work. Hello? Boss? Boss, this is PJ. He's a security guard at Chopra's compound. PJ. You have something for me? Just as you asked for it. The office in Narimba Point. Anyone can get this map. No, this is a different office in South Mumbai. Very top secret, with lots of security. Move! Move! They've agreed to meet. That's progress. Prague is Vadim's entry point into the EU. Over half his business passes through this city. It's good to see you again, my friend. Nice to see you again. Hi, how are you? My lawyer, Mr. Alexander. Karel Benes. Nice to meet you. I'm afraid Mr. Reznik has been held up. For how long? He'll meet us tonight. He apologises. He's asked me to have preliminary discussions with you. Please. I'm willing to accept Mr. Reznik not getting back to me because of personal issues. The money I advanced him was a gesture of goodwill, so he's free to spend it as he wishes. But I also believe that I have demonstrated that I am a serious partner. I've had that discussion with him. Mr. Reznik is concerned any increased activity from us will draw attention from the Russians. I was led to believe Mr. Reznik's ambitions were to compete with the Russians. Now I ask myself if he's a serious partner. Klimov and the Russian gangs have the backing of Vadim. Vadim has the backing of elements within the Russian state. Our government is so busy trying to be a Western democracy it wants nothing to do with us. Then I'll have to take my business elsewhere. With respect, we're here to persuade Mr. Reznik that he doesn't need state protection to further his business opportunities. The world has moved on. What we're offering you is a substantial investment with very few strings attached. All we ask is that you make life uncomfortable for Vadim and his associates. Bribes to officials, seizures of their contraband. And we will pay for everything. I'll leave Mr. Alexander to talk you through the details. I'll have the poultry menu, please. The medieval menu for me. And to drink? Just sparkling mineral water. The one thing your boss overlooks is stupidity. He's a clever man, but he thinks he's dealing with someone like himself. Reznik has only three circuits in his brain, yes, no, later. What should my boss have done? Send a message before you came. Maybe burn down one of our factories. That way the negotiations would have been more serious. So you think we're wasting our time? There are better restaurants in Prague he could have taken you to. If he's so stupid, why do you work for him? Why does anybody work for a boss? I was fired from my job and he offered me a good salary. It's quite a leap. From policeman to this. Not in this country. And you, Mr. Alexander, how does a lawyer like you get mixed up in a business like this? I just sit behind a desk and read contracts. "Later." Look, I don't want to bore you, but Vadim and Klimov make more than 600 million annually from their counterfeit and smuggling operations in this country. Your boss makes 20. Plus the five he stole from you. You've already convinced me of the benefits of doing business with you this afternoon. But unfortunately, people like you and I don't have much influence. If we did, I'm sure we could reach an agreement. I think you'll find my boss is a reasonable man, too. You're being modest. You forget, I'm a former policeman. I still have contacts in the police. At the airport. You shouldn't travel under your own passport. You come from a distinguished family, Mr. Godman. Perhaps you should be sitting at that table instead of with me. You are wasting my time tonight with this ridiculous display. Do you think I would want to invest...? Perhaps we should both move tables. It makes you look like a fool. If you have nothing else to say to me, I would like to go home. There is an earlier flight. It gets you into Heathrow before ten. That would be helpful. If you could also arrange a connecting flight for Mr. Kleiman. Of course. What are you going to do? Put my money to better use than I did this time. These pricks. They have no idea how big a world will come down on them. How does that help us in Prague? Ah, forget Prague. We concentrate on Mumbai. Until I can find someone here I can do business with. We don't have long, so I'll make this very clear. You're someone we'd be very happy to do business with. If he finds out I'm even talking to you, he could have me killed. Then we're both caught between a rock and a hard place. A partnership is good for everyone. A disagreement isn't. Please ask Mr. Reznik to reconsider. Only the Russian girls. Who speaks English? - Yes. - Yes. Moskvy. How old? 22. You look younger. No. I like her face. I'll take her. - Oh, look! - Hey. - Hey! - I didn't expect you till tomorrow. The meeting finished early. Well, have you eaten anything? I'm fine. I ate on the plane. Is Prague as beautiful as they say? I didn't get to see much. Pour me a wine. I'm going to go and dump this. What kind of view is this? You like sniffing ladies garments? This way, Bhai. You see? Perfect. You can see everyone who goes in. Chopra's lawyers, business partners, officials he bribes. Benny Chopra. Let's see who's God. It's me. I want just to talk to you. Mama? Alex! Is Katya with you? Hi, Becky. - No. - No? Where is she? - Where the hell is she?! - Shh... - She should be here! - Shh. Hey. Papa? It's raining. We're in London, Papa. Where is she? All she cares about is herself. I can't reach her. I've tried her friends she was out with, but they're not answering either. Did you leave a message? I didn't want to tell her on the phone. I said it was urgent. Is it her? No. Sorry, Femi. One second. - Hi? - Reznik is dead. Yep. It was an accident. It seems he was drunk and fell off the balcony of his apartment. What did you say to Benes at the airport? That I hoped he was someone we could do business with. It seems you were right. Anything else? No. This is how it works, I'm afraid. That's all you had to say. I can't talk right now. We got what we wanted, Alex. This is good news. I'll call you later. You must be exhausted. Here, have a chocolate. It will get easier now. Please. Tanya tells me that your mother is not well. Her kidneys? She needs an operation. We will see to it. We will help each other. I have many friends who will like you. Men I do business with. No. Don't worry. I don't expect you to do anything you don't want to do. Just talk to them, listen to what they have to say, and then we will send you home. I'm sorry. I was out and my phone was off and I didn't know. - I'm sorry. - Shh. Are you not ashamed? It's all right, Mama, she's here now. Did he get out of the window? I locked it again. It wasn't your fault.
