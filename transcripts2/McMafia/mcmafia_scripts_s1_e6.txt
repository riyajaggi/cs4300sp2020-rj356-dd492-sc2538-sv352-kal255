 - I'll see you at the party. - Please ride safe. 'The charges against him include sexual assault and battery.' Do you have any idea who's behind this? There's the obvious possibility but then I have many enemies. I'm pregnant. That's wonderful. Is it anyone I know? Dmitri. If I help Mr Kleiman, will he let me go? - What did you see? - Another boy, they were together. Semiyon was set up, we have a witness who can prove it. He's going to talk to Mr Kleiman for you.

 - He thinks it will work out. - We can be better friends to you and more dangerous enemies for Vadim, but first we need Mr Kleiman's ships. We're not strong enough to take on Vadim without their help I don't believe you'd blackmail me. - I thought this was over. - So did I. Mr Godman. My regards to your family. If Kleiman withdraws his capital from your fund, we'll invest in his place... ...through legal channels, of course. Right now, I'm more concerned about Rebecca and my family. It won't be easy for Vadim to try anything against you in London. He'd require FSB approval to act in a foreign territory.

 I can't take that chance. What kind of security does your family have in place? Some. But probably not enough. And Rebecca? I don't think she'd consider it even if she knew. And you can't tell her? That's why in this business it's easier to have no attachments. You're not wearing the ring I got you? I thought it was casual tonight. It's never casual with my mother... - Is there something we need to talk about? - No. Why? - I'm not stupid, Rebecca... - I don't want a fight. I don't want one either, but I would like to know what's wrong? - Really? - Yes, really. You go to Israel... your gangster friend gets off a rape charge, two witnesses are killed and you come back like nothing happened! - What do you want me to say? - Something. Anything. I told you everything. There's nothing more to say. If you were me, what would you believe? I'm not you! My uncle was murdered and my family were almost killed! I'm not you. I can't put on an act in front of your parents. Then don't come. What... you're just going to walk away like that? You can come or you can stay, it's up to you. Can you apologise for me and tell them I'm not feeling well? Sure. Subtitles by explosiveskull Becky's ill, why couldn't Femi come? He's working late. What's that for? When he marries you, he won't have to work. Who'd want to marry into this family? Papa, did you send the driver away? I didn't see him outside. That's his job as well. He's meant to be your bodyguard. Bodyguard... I just want to put my mind at rest, that's all. I don't understand. Speak to me in English. You mix in dirty money? - No. - No? Then why you worry about my security now? Because the last time I was in Israel was with Uncle Boris. The whole trip all I could think about was that I didn't want the same thing to happen to you. Yes? I tried to speak to Mr Kleiman. He isn't going to change his mind. Thank you for trying. There might be another way. I'm going to see if Mr Godman can help. You don't have to do that. I know. Before I decide, I want your surveillance team to find out everything they can about Godman's family. Not just their movements and security, but how often he sees them, where he sees them, how long for. I want information on their personal lives and how close he is to each of them... to his father, mother, sister, girlfriend. He's lucky he doesn't have children. 'Only one team. 'A local helper and two surveillance operators. 'They'll be caught on security cameras so they mustn't stand out. 'I'll need logistical help and a communications network 'and I'll take care of the firearms myself.' I have a car booked. Marius Jensen. - Would you like a drink? - No, I'm fine, thanks. Alex. Alex. What do you think? Yeah, they both look great. Try them on. - Is it for a special occasion? - Our engagement. Congratulations! - Hello? - It's Joseph, Mr Kleiman's driver. Yes, of course. How are you? I was thinking of visiting London. I was hoping to meet with you if you had time. Sure. When are you thinking of coming? Soon. Actually, there is something I may need your help with, so, let me know when you've made your plans. OK, bye. Looks great. I mean, yeah, that's it, isn't it? What are you looking at now? Nothing. Why, what is it now? You've been staring out the window for ten minutes. - I can't look out the window? - Oh, come on, Alex! I want you to trust me. To tell me what the hell is going on with you. - You know what's going on. - No, I don't. I think there's a whole lot more that you're not telling me. What are you so afraid of? I can't be engaged to you like this. We need to work this out. Then maybe you should move out for a while. What? Just like that? No, not just like that. I think we both need a break. I don't need a break. I'm not some teenage girl who you've just been going out with for a week. I don't want you around me when I'm like this. So, what, I'm just supposed to disappear - until you get your head together? - Until I've sorted things. No! It doesn't work like that! - Where are you going? - For a walk. I'm not going to find somewhere else to live tonight, am I? Rebecca. Joseph, it's Alex Godman. I've been thinking about our conversation I'm not sure what your situation is with Mr Kleiman, but I may know a way to help Lyudmilla. I may also need your advice on something. How soon can you come? Yes? I want to give you my notice. Any particular reason? I've been offered some security work abroad. Where? London. Is it more money you want? No, sir. Have I done something to offend you? It's easy to forget how much you see in your position. Everything we try to hide from the rest of the world. I'm not all bad, Joseph. I will let the girl go, but in my own time. Not for you or for Mr Godman. - Was it OK? - Fine. When's the procedure? - I'm not sure yet. - Masha. - I can't do it. I want to keep the baby. - Nobody has to know it's his. - He does. Who else is going to pay for you? There are lots of people with less money than me who have children. Masha, Masha, all those rich men who've supported you all your life, they won't be there when you have a kid! Masha! They're all self-catered flats with a daily maid service. Do you know how long you might be staying? A few weeks at least. The gym and swimming pool are downstairs. It gets busier on weekends, but even then it's usually fine. See the gym? Allon and I served in the IDF together for many years. Any information about your family will be confidential. I need to ask you about the hostile party's motivations. My uncle was involved in an attempt on Vadim Kalyagin's life. And I am responsible for the disruption of his business interests, but I'd prefer that to remain between us. How many PPOs at present? Just my father's chauffeur. How many would they be comfortable with? No more than one. My mother and sister probably wouldn't notice any covert surveillance. And your girlfriend? She's moved out. I assumed I'd be the main target and so wanted us to live apart for a while. - Have you told her about the threat? - No. Does she have any family that you're close to? No, her parents have passed away. Can we discuss firearms? Don't worry, Mr Godman, we'll be armed. - Mrs Godman... - Yeah. - ...this is Jennifer. Oh, she's far too beautiful to be a bodyguard. Hi, Jennifer. Three times is Russian. - Miss Godman, this is Frantz. - Hi, Frantz. Sir, this is Monk. - A real name? - Nickname, sir. Thought it sounded better than Percy. I imagine you've had some experience of close protection before. In Russia, I had a small army to look after me. We hire a lot of Russians in our firm. They're very good. Nothing like the cliches. Don't worry about that. It puts my mind at rest. I know, Papa. These aren't the same. The sleeves on the fake one... look. See? Just fix it. Carolina? Carolina? Milan. - How old is she? - Six months. You're French? How did you guess? I'm Sylvie and this is Alba. Oh, what a beautiful name. I'm Rebecca. - You're a good swimmer. - Oh, thank you. That's why I'm teaching her early. We are from Marseille, so she has to learn. Hmm? Excuse me. - Hi. - Hey. I was just calling to see if everything's OK. Everything's fine. I just went for a swim. They have a pool here. - How long did you rent the place for? - Three months. Look, it may have been a stupid idea... ...but maybe it makes us stronger in the long run. - We'll see. - I'll call you soon. Bye. This colour would look great on you. - I'm OK, thank you, Mrs Godman. - No, you're not, Jenny. You have to look like my companion, not my maid. Roxanne, please? Darling, I'm looking for a dress for my friend, Jennifer. Perhaps a longer dress, like this? Oh, it's gorgeous. You will look so elegant in this dress, Jenny. Go try it on over there, darling. Go on, go on. I'm sorry, do you speak English? I speak very good English. Do you? I apologise. It's London. We're all foreigners. That's a beautiful bag. Would you like to try it on? I'm looking for a present for my wife. Hmm. You can never go wrong with Dior. - Oksana... - Yes? - ...what do you think? - Oh, it's beautiful. Thank you for your help. It was nice to meet you. You, too. Jennifer, you look like a model. Do you like it? No? Monk, tell me something. If I go somewhere, do you have to report to your boss? - Yes. - And to my son? Depends what sort of arrangement they have. Then you stay in the car. You don't think I take any chances? Pozhaluysta. Where's Rebecca? She's moved out for a while. What does that mean? We're spending some time apart. It'll be fine. - When did this happen? - A few days ago. Please don't tell anyone. Nobody knows. No, I won't. Do you want to hear something even worse? Masha is pregnant with Papa's child. Papa? - How long have you known? - A few weeks. - Why didn't you say anything? - What do you want me to say? I thought she was going to get rid of it. Does Papa know? I don't think so. Is she going to get rid of it? I doubt it. She seems pretty determined. Oh, God! This is going to kill Mama. - Andre. - Andre. - Hello. - Hi! Nanny's back. Thank God! I have half an hour to myself. - Is your husband travelling? - We are separated. - Are you married? - No. You saved yourself a lot of grief. Hello? It's Karel Benes. Hi. How are you? I'm sorry, Mr Godman. I have to see you. I'm having some problems in Prague. At first, I thought I was paranoid... people following me, police I'd paid off not doing their job. Then my daughter was hurt... ...and I thought, "Too many coincidences." I knew, one day, there would be a war with Vadim, - but not so soon. - I'm sorry it's come to this. We made good money for a while. Very good money. Whenever I have problems, I eat too much. What was Semiyon's advice? He wouldn't take my calls. That's why I came to you. He and I are no longer in business together. What about your own security? I have good people. Armed? Protect your family, too. Before they come for you, they'll go after them. They'll want you to know the ones you love suffered because of you, whoever you're closest to, whoever will hurt you the most. I broke up with my girlfriend to try and protect her. Unfortunately, I can't do that with my family. Please, tell me what it is I can do for you. I need some cash to pay bribes. - Maybe 50,000 US. - I'll have it for you tomorrow. Forgive me, my friend. I don't like to ask. I'm sorry, I hope I didn't disturb you. - She cried so much. - Not at all. - I was just going to work. Is she OK? - Yes. Now she's fine. I didn't realise we lived on the same floor. - I'm in 3C. - Oh! We should have a drink when my nanny's back. - That'd be lovely. - Great. - Oh, do you need the lift? - No, I'll wait. Go ahead. - OK. Bye. - Thank you. Bye-bye. What you asked for. - Hi. - Can we come in? Sure. - Is everything OK? - We wanted to talk to you. - I can see. - Katya told me you've decided to keep the baby. That's right. If that's what you want, then we'll pay for it. I don't need... - We'll pay for it. - Your child is part of us now. We'll do everything we can to look after you both, but if you try to hurt our family, we'll stop you. What does that mean? He's your father's child. We'll give you £20,000 a month to bring up your baby somewhere else. If you need more, we're willing to listen. I am not going anywhere. What else are you going to do? Who else is going to support you? No. Don't look at me like that. You should have thought of our friendship before you slept with my father. It's your choice. If you decide to turn this into a battle, then we will fight you. But if you're willing to find another way... ...we are, too. Bring your left elbow to the outside of your right knee. Sit up tall. Lengthen through your spine. From there, twisting, looking over your right shoulder. It's OK that I choose a Czech restaurant? I didn't know that there were any in London. Just one. It was started for the Czech soldiers who fought for the British in the war. She reminds me of my daughter Carolina. Forgive me for asking, but what did they do to her? Nothing. They just threaten her. - Did you enjoy that? - Yes, ma'am. Thank you, darling. That's my biggest regret... I never saw her grow up. Her mother left me just after she was born. - So, you've been married twice? - Three times, but Carolina's mother was the love of my life. Sometimes, I wish I hadn't. Family, children... it's wonderful, but the worry is bigger than the joy. You think to yourself... ...one day, if God takes them away from me, what do I do? You're a good man. - I wish that were true. - It is. This isn't your world. I'm sorry you got mixed up in it. But this business turns us into people we don't like. Jennifer, you frightened me! How about you? Are you going to get married soon? I hope so. - One day. - I have a good feeling this will be over soon. She'll move back and you'll get married. You'll just have to buy her a house with a swimming pool. Would you excuse me just one minute? I need to check on Rebecca. He knows there's a swimming pool in her apartment block. I never told him that. You have to go back in. He can't know anything's wrong. It will buy us time. We have someone watching her. I'll go there now. I think we should order. Do you have a picture? - Of Carolina? - Oh, yeah. She's very beautiful. - Hi. - Hello. - Oh, thank you. It's really not that formal. I'm just making pasta. - Come in. - Thank you. Your bodyguard hasn't come back. I sent him home. - Can I give you a hand? - No, I'm fine. There's some wine on the table. What is it they say about murderers wanting to get caught? Their guilt gives them away. Or maybe it's the alcohol. What did they ask you to do? They wanted information. Anything I could tell them. They could have tortured me for days and I wouldn't have told them anything. But my daughter, my child. You understand? What was it you told me? They'll go after your family before they go for you? Your wife. Your daughter Carolina. Do you think they'll spare them now? Is that Alba? The nanny takes her for a walk when she can't sleep, - but I'm not moving. - It's my night off. Don't worry. I'm going to take you to Mummy. - Anything? - No. Quick as you can, please. And did you fight a lot with your boyfriend? - All the time. - Well, that's a good sign. Yes! It's when you stop fighting that it's over. I'm sure everything will be fine. It better be. I'm pregnant. That's wonderful, yes? I'm going to have another drink to celebrate your good news. Help! Can I help you? - Rebecca Harper. - Are you family? - Her fiance. - She's in surgery. Subtitles by explosiveskull
