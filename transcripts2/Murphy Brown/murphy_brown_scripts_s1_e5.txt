Grab a brush. Eldin. you are looking at a crazy person. I sat in my ottice today and watched a child bite the head oil a Smurt. There are sticky little tingerprints all over everything I own. They threw up in my car. And to top it all oil. my house is still a shambles. I can't take it. I want it tinished.

Well. you shou|d've thought about that betore you threw up. We want dinner. What's tor dinner? What. in this house? How about a Midol sandwich? Listen. how would you all like to go to a real fun restaurant? What restaurant. Eldin? What restaurant? Don't worry about it. you're gonna love it. Coats back on. Do other housepainters go there? I don't wanna go to a housepainter place. Will you relax? Look. I'll drive. We'll take my truck. - It doesn't have any seats. - Oh. yeah. Okay. everybody. grab a bucket. Hello. Welcome to the Washington Crab House. I'm your waiter. Brad. I know you. you're Murphy Brown. - Right. - Oh. this is exciting. - And good evening to you. Mr. Brown. - He's not Mr. Brown. Well. you have very lovely children. Ms. Brown. They're not my children. Anyway... ...here are your mallets. And the specials are on the blackboard... ...and I'll be back to take your order in just a tew minutes. Good going. Eldin. Now they're armed. Hey. kids. look. I see Jell-O on the salad bar. You notice how they have to run everyplace? Why do they do that? You know. you could be just a little more tolerant. All you do is criticize. It you keep on spoiling them. how am I supposed to discipline them? You are too controlling. They have to let oil a little steam once in a while. That's easy tor you to say. You're not the one stuck with them all day. Just a second. Didn't I take you to a restaurant tonight? Oh. nice place. It sounds like Santa's workshop. I work hard. you know. Don't you think I deserve a place with tablecloths? Hey! Can you control your kids over there? Hey. you guys. quit it. Stop it now. Ouit. Ouit it. Stop throwing tood. you rotten little Huns. and go sit down! Isn't that Murphy Brown? I thought we should have some really elegant things. Miniature crepes with shrimp tilling. stutted mushroom caps and petits tours. - I don't make that stutt. - What? It's weenie food. I do hamburgers. chili. onion rings. It you want. I'll throw in the pork rinds tor tree. Great. Miles. how are you doing on the decorations? Great. Corky. I cancelled this week's broadcast... ...so I'd have time to work on centerpieces. The party is tonight. Miles. I want this place transformed. or somebody doesn't get a grab bag. Murphy. I need to talk to you. What is it. Corky? I don't mean to embarrass you... ...but you're not on any ot the party committees. - I'm not going to the Christmas party. - What? Why? The memory of last year's party is still fresh in my mind. Perhaps you heard about it. I drank all the punch... ...and faxed my chest to the West Coast. I don't think I'm ready to risk it. Okay. everybody. pay attention. Today we've got new rules. You are not allowed to yell. scream. bite or cry. You must remain seated in this room at all times. In short. don't bother me. or your brief careers as children will be over... ...and I really mean it. .MurphY? _Joey... ...|'ve told you. I don't know why Barney Rubble doesn't wear shoes. I wasn't going to ask that. I wanted to know. where are we gonna sleep tonight? I don't know. But a nice lady from social services... ...is coming today. and she'll take care of it. It's Christmas Eve. How will Santa know where to find us? Santa? Oh. great. This is how it starts. First Santa. then the tooth fairy... ...then you grow up and invent the trickle-down theory. I'm going to do you a big favor and be the first adult... ...who's ever been honest with you. You don't have to worry about Santa because there isn't... Because he doesn't... Because I'll call him and tell him where you'll be. You know Santa Claus? Yeah. We met in a bar in Morocco. Now. be quiet. I'm trying to concentrate. Murphy. could you give this letter to Santa? It's kind of important. Could you check that I spelled everything right? "Dear Santa. how are you? Hope you don't have a cold anymore. Mom told us that's why you couldn't... ...come to our house last year. Don't worry. we understand. If you're feeling better. could you find our mother... ...and tell her that we miss her a lot? You don't have to bring us anything. but maybe... ...could you give something to Murphy for taking care of us? A pony would be nice. We think she really needs one. Thank you. Joey. Michael and Lily." I'll make sure that he gets this. You know. I always wanted a pony. Me too. - Hello. Murphy Brown? - Yes. Francine O'Donnell from social services. I've come to pick up the children. Oh. right. Well. here they are. All three of them. You ready to go. QUYS? I guess so. Okay. let's get our coats on. It takes them a while to get their coats on. And I think you should know... ...Joey walks in his sleep at night. so keep your ears open. And... ...Michae| sounds like he's getting a cold. And Lily... ...would really like a pony for Christmas. Wouldn't we all. Okay. children. come along with me. Merry Christmas. Right. Hey. wait a minute. You can't take them yet. I just remembered something. What? Well... ...it's just that it's Christmas Eve. If they go. how will Santa know where to find them? Excuse me? See. they've been moving around a lot lately... ...and Santa's memory isn't what it used to be. Just to be on the safe side. why don't they stay with me? - You sure? - I'm sure. Speaking professionally. I think you made the right decision. Okay. here's the plan. First. we're gonna call Santa. I haven't really talked to him since he forgot my pony last year... ...but this is no time to hold grudges. Then we're gonna go shopping at that big toy store on M Street. - What do you say? - Do we have to wear the rope? Can't believe you broke the skateboard. We bought it 20 minutes ago. Well. you try it in high heels. Surprise! Oh. Eldin. I've never seen a tree this beautiful before. I figured I should get you something for Christmas. And it was either this or a Waterpik. Oh. and by the way. while you were out. somebody stopped by. And he's in the kitchen right now having milk and cookies. Gee. I wonder who that could be. I wasn't expecting anybody. Hey there. kids. Merry Christmas. - Wow. Santa! - Santa! Murphy'S PONY- I'd have done this thing right and come through the chimney... ...but Santa has a bad back. Did you ever try to lift one of these things? Santa. how do you get to everybody's house in one night? Oh. it's easier than it used to be. I got me a really souped-up sleigh. Brought in a couple of elves from Japan. Took the thing right into the '80s. But did you find our mommy yet? Oh. well. I'm working on it there. son. But don't you give up hope. I know she'll turn up real soon. Well... I gotta be going now. Traffic's gonna be murder over the Atlantic. You all have a Merry Christmas now. - Thanks. Phil. I owe you one. - A hundred bucks and we'll call it even. Okay. everybody. get on your PJs. and then I'll tell you a bedtime story. Can we hear the one about Haldeman and Ehrlichman again? If you're good. I guess Santa must have forgotten something. Miss Brown? I'm so sorry to barge in like this. Mommy. Mommy! Lily- Miss Brown. this has been the worst 24 hours of my life. I'm so sorry to have put you through this. - Actually. it wasn't that much- - Thank you for being so nice. - I'll take them and go now. - Now? You and Mr. Brown must wanna get on with your holiday plans. Well. we really didn't have any big plans. Wait. How are you gonna take care of them? As long as we're together. we'll find a way. - I'd like to help you out. - No. please. - You've done too much already. - No. look. really. I do pretty well for myself. I have an expense account. I write a lot of things off. I don't really take Walter Cronkite to dinner every week. I guess I'm telling you more than you need to know. Here. - This should tide you over for a while. - No. I can't take that. Lady. take the check. Believe me. she doesn't do this very often. I wish there was something I could do for you. There is. Promise you'll call whenever you need anything. Okay. kids. let's go. I'll send their new bedroom sets and the VCRs and the ice rink. Lily? I know Santa brought the pony for me. but I think we could share him. - What do you say? - Oh. boy. Goodbye. Merry Christmas. Well. so I guess my- My work here is done. Yeah. I guess so. It'll take me a few minutes to get my things together. I got a wrench set that's all over this place. Although. Eldin. you know. I've been noticing that the walls... - ...on my bedroom could use a little work. - A little work? Who sold you that wallpaper. Robert Goulet? Just tell me. how long is it gonna take? Couple days. tops. - I can live with that. - Great. okay... ...|'|| move my scaffold back into the bedroom. I got- Wait a minute. It's Christmas Eve. All of a sudden. I'm in the mood for a good party. I know where I can find one. You wanna go with me? Yeah. okay. But if I get lucky. you're taking a bus home. So. Corky... ...after all my hard work. I haven't heard one compliment on the decorations. Miles. has anybody ever told you you're a real shlimazl? - Hey. Murphy! - Murphy! Hey. I'd like you to meet my friend. Eldin Bernecky. Okay. everybody. Murphy showed up and she brought a friend... ...so let's all think before we take that extra meatball. Let's liven this party up a little. How about some real music? Coming right up. All right. it's about time! - Okay. challenge dance. - What's that? All right. Hey. Jim. come on! Jim! Jim! Jim!
