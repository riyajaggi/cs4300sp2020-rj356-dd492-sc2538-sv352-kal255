I never expected to get out. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. 9UY5- - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Goodbye. Now. let me see it I've got this right. I don't have a secretary today because you can't work on a Jewish holiday... ...but you can't remember which Jewish holiday it is? No. I'm sorry. Ms. McCall. Rosh Kippur doesn't quite make it. Murphy. I want you to know this is a red-letter day here at FYI. Ratings last night went through the root. We pulled a 36 share on the overnights. That's wondertul. but I've got a lot ol work to do and no secretary to help me do it... - ...so it you don't mind. - You know... ...that Kyle Whitsett piece. I knew it was good the moment I heard about it. - I've got my linger on the pulse. - You've got your butt on my notes. Hello. Donna Copley. please. Hi. this is Murphy Brown lrom FYI. You lilled in as my secretary once. remember? Donna? Hello? Did you see the paper? Two outstanding reviews ol last night's show. - Let me see. - Frank. I'm working here. You know. I was the one who passed the story on to Murphy. She practically begged me to. What could I say? - You lie like a rug. Frank. - I lie? Charlene. you recognized my voice. Hello? Boy. I just can't stop thinking about that Kyle. What a prolession this is. huh? To be able to change someone's lile in such a positive way. And it's so gratilying to know that I was such a very big part ol it. Corky. do you have to eat that in here? - Here's your collee. Corky. - Oh. thanks. Oh. gee. Jim. nice ol you to drop by. Please. make yoursell at home. Thanks. Murphy. You know... ...l was thinking about the piece we did last night on that little lellow. Good stull. I remember when the anonymous tip was called in. "Miles." I said. "do this story." Do you remember that? - No. - You didn't have anything to do with it. Murphy. you got a visitor. That guy lrom last night's show. Kyle? What's he doing here? - Hey. how's it going? - Hello. Kyle. Hi. gang- Where'd you get the duds. Kyle? Oh. I bought these duds just belore I went to prison. Practically brand-new. Pretty nice. huh? - Sharp. - Yeah. Groovy. Boy. I sure missed you guys. What have you been up to? Well. mostly we went home. slept... ...then came back to work. Boy. it leels good to be someplace lamiliar. Hang around with my lriends. I guess I haven't quite caught up with the world yet. You've been out one day. I'm sure once you get settled... ...and lind a job. things will be easier. Oh. yeah. I've been on interviews already. Well. the manager at Willie's Wieners said he wouldn't hire me... ...because I was in prison once. The guy at Marty's Garage was interested till I leaned on the car he was working under. I'm gonna check back with him when he gets out ol the hospital. Well. I'm sure something will turn up. You've just gotta hang in there. Boy. the world sure changed a lot in 15 years. I should've tried to get in the computer training program at prison... ...instead ol spending all that time in interpretive dance class. Well. y'all look real busy. I just wanted to drop by and say hi. - Bye. - Goodbye. Kyle. Bye. Bye. Man. that is heartbreaking. You take a person lrom a protected environment. sometimes they can't adjust. It's like he was better oll in jail. belore Murphy threw him out on the streets... - ...scared and alone. - What? Now. wait. We should all share the responsibility. There is no responsibility. We report stories. It's our job to be objective and uninvolved. It ends there. She's right. you know. Though. somehow. this is dillerent. I know it's not prolessional. but darn it all. you just wanna help the little lellow. Look. I leel sorry lor him too. But we're not gonna be doing him any lavors... ...il we interlere. He's gotta know he can lend lor himsell. Now. il you'll excuse me. I have too much work to do. You know. I just got a great idea. - Kyle. - Hi. Miss Brown. Did you have a nice lunch? No. I didn't. Kyle. My lunch guest didn't show up. Do you know why? - Why? - He went to the wrong restaurant. - What'd he wanna go and do that lor? - Somebody told him to. You. Kyle. You sent the secretary ol state to Captain Larry's Chicken Roundup. They made him wear a paper hat. Kyle. I passed by that place this morning on my way to work. It looked like lun. I guess the name just kind ol stuck in my head. I'm real sorry. It'll never happen again. - Yeah. right. How's that letter coming? - Just line. When they taught you typing in prison... ...did they mention the process tends to go laster il you use both hands? - But Big Eddie only taught us this way. - Big Eddie? Big Eddie One Arm. Oh. dang. - I think the ribbon's jammed. - When you're through... ...get me the research on the B1. I can't tell where you liled it. Check. - Kyle. - Yes ma'am? - Have you seen my ant larm? - Oh. I meant to tell you. I was cleaning the glass. The poor little guys. they could hardly see out. Well. not that it's really a problem now. Oh. Kyle. I loved those ants. Well. I'm sorry. ll it makes you leel any better. most ol them survived the crash. Boy. can those little things skedaddle. Oh. great. - Here. let me do that. - Hey. Murphy. Kyle. Just came by to see how things are going. Kyle. this would be a good time lor you to get me those liles. Sure thing. Miles. this isn't working out. I have certain needs. Someone who liles alphabetically. Someone who makes a cup ol collee without setting oll the smoke alarm. Someone who can lind his way back here... ...without stopping at the lobby directory. You know. I didn't wanna say anything... ...but this parade ol secretaries you've gone through. It's always their lault. it's never you. - Isn't that it, Murphy? - Yes. Yeah. For your own sake. I suggest you try to make this work. Getting along with other people is a rellection ol getting along with yoursell. I've got your rellection right here. pal. Here you go. It's the wrong lile. Kyle. You're a poet and you don't know it. - How goes it. Kyle? - It goes well. You don't happen to have a copy ol the Moscow report lrom last month. do you? - By my desk. - Oh. I'll get it. Mr. Dial. Kyle seems quite enthusiastic about his new surroundings. How's he doing? Oh. swell. Miss Brown. were those books on your shelves in any real special order? Kyle. don't go into my ollice anymore. Even il I lorget and ask you to. okay?! Her bark is worse than her bite. - So we're still on lor tonight? - You bet. Doris is making stroganoll and apple lritters. - In the microwave? - No. but we could melt a stick ol butter. - How long does that take? - Thirty seconds. Can you believe it? Kyle. I need more typewriter ribbon lrom the supply room. - Check. - Hey. Kyle. I've got something lor you. - For me? - Friday's game. - Bullets and Celtics, just like I promised. - Hey. thanks. Mr. Fontana. Kyle. the ribbon! Don't let her get to you. Kyle. She's had kind ol a tough time ever since she got back lrom the Betty Ford Clinic. - Just give her a chance. okay? - Okay. MY man! I'll get it. Murphy Brown's ollice. The ribbon. Kyle. - Check. - Kyle... ...| just wanted to say how proud we all are ol you. - You're doing a labulous job. - Hey. thanks. - Can you hold please. senator? - Would you like to go to the game with me? Oh. gee. Kyle. I'd love to. but I hate basketball. Tall men lrighten me. Oh. I see. I've got a lriend though. Her name's Barbara. And a little voice is telling me you two just might hit it oll. Barbara. great. Hold please. one second. Still there. senator? Great. Hold please. one sec. Murphy Brown's ollice. And listen. Kyle. don't let Murphy make you crazy. She gets this way around the 18th ol every month. Mark that day on your calendar. We all have. Hi. Murphy. Why are you working over here? I don't know. Frank. ljust lelt like having some privacy. Yeah. the ollice can get pretty crazy. Kyle. He's quite a character. He accidentally stapled my mail to his tie. That's the lourth time this week. - He's getting to you. - I didn't say that. - I thought you guys already had your lunch. - We did. Kyle was making collee back at the ollice. We thought we'd take a walk. I guess he's still adjusting to lile on the outside. - He's come along way already. - Who are we kidding? The guy's a loser. Do I sense a change ol heart? Wednesday he kept me up until 2 a.m... ...testing ways to ask Barbara to bear his children. Every night this week. he's shown up on my back porch at dinnertime. Last night during collee and dessert... ...he danced lor us. Doris tried to kill him with a Dustbuster. That's nothing. He carpools with me. Every day he teaches me a new song he learned in prison. Today it was "The Warden's A-Winking at Me." You talking about the wimpy guy in the hippie outlit? I don't like him. Comes in here. starts telling me how to run my kitchen. Says he's got some recipe lor chow mein that serves 5000. Tomorrow. I'm gonna put in a real high doorknob. Well. I'm not one to say I told you so. Yes. you are. I told you so. I warned you about the objectivity ol journalists... - ...and I warned you about interlering with- - Just lire him. Murphy. - Me? - I would. but he knows where I live. I don't know. I think Kyle is really starting to catch on. Don't toy with us. What do we have to do. grovel? - Please. - Please. Okay. I'll lire him. You bunch ol wusses. - He lound us. - How does he do it? We had an old bloodhound like that back home. We had to shoot him. - Hi. Phil. - Last call. Hi. gang. You got room lor one more? - Take my seat. - Important meeting. - Better run. - Bye-bye. See you later. I'm glad you stopped by. Kyle. I think we should talk. - I'm all ears. - I believe in being direct. - That's why I'm going to just- - I know you! You're Murphy Brown. I've seen you on TV. What's that show you're on? - FYI. - No. Maanlighting. You're always nagging that guy with lunny hair. We'd like to be alone. il you don't mind. Boy. pretty uppity lor a costar. Oh. now. you just wait a minute there. big mister. Kyle. I can take care ol this. Murphy took a chance on me... ...when the world was looking down their noses at me. - Kyle. - She taught me to believe in mysell. And lor the lirst time in my lile. I do. Sure. you hear a lot ol bad stull about her. She's bossy. she's irritable. she's a drunkard... - ...she can't get a date to save her lile. - Kyle! But because ol this woman. I've been given a second chance. A new start. I owe this woman my lile. my luture. Murphy Brown's a saint. I tell you. A saint. Gee. I had no idea. I'm real sorry. I leel like a weenie. Boy. what a lathead. So. boss. what's up? There are hundreds ol jobs in here. There must be something he can do. Hey. "Looking lor trainable persons lor positions... ...in the last-paced world ol air trallic control." At least I'm trying. Miles is reading "Dear Abby." I have the alternoon papers. What happened to your shirt? Kyle gave me a pen. I bought this shirt in Milan. Four tailors measured me so the lit would be exact. Down to the dillerence in circumlerence between my lelt and right wrists. I don't want him here anymore. I just don't want him. Come on. he'll be back lrom the Xerox room any minute. Hey. here's something. "Telephone sales. No experience necessary." How could he screw that up? He has no experience. I've seen him dial a phone. I'm gonna call and give him a recommendation just to be on the sale side. Not to be the voice ol negativity... ...but are we doing the right thing here? It's like playing God with a man's lile. Call! Well. what do you think? Kyle. my man. You are on lire. Again? No. no. I think he means you look very debonair. I never had a suit like this belore. The pants don't even ride up. And this is only the beginning. Kyle. ll you get this job. you have a bright and promising career ahead ol you... ...in the exciting lield ol telephone sales. Oh. gee. I like the sound ol that. But what about you guys? It isn't right lor me to just abandon you. Yes. it is. Ky|e- I mean. we'd all leel so guilty... ...il we thought we'd held you back lrom this opportunity. Ol course. we'll miss you. Right, guys? - Yeah. it'll be rough. - We'll miss you. Oh. you guys are the greatest. You just give and give and give. Well. we're givers. Now. remember what I told you? You're a valuable human being. An asset to any organization. Valuable human being. an asset. I got it. It sometimes helps to have a little anecdote ready lor the interview. Maybe I could tell them about the time the guys in my cellblock... ...tried to drown me in the toilet bowl. Skip the anecdote. Kyle. Hello. Doris? No. no word. Just keep your lingers crossed and be strong. Goodbye. He didn't get it. I know he didn't get it. He'll come back to that desk. He'll slowly and methodically destroy everything in my ollice... ...except the phone cord. which he'll accidentally wrap around my neck. They'll lind my body pressed against the glass. trying to get out. And then he'll go to jail. until some idiot journalist gets him out. I didn't get it. This is going to kill Doris. They said I was overqualilied. They said anybody who dresses as nice as I do doesn't belong in telephone sales. But the good news is. on the way back... ...the cab I was in ran into the back ol one ol those High Mountain Water trucks. And I said to mysell. I said. "Hey... ...now. that's the job lor Kyle Whitsett." Outdoors. just tooling around in a big old truck. - And guess what. - What? What. Kyle. what? The man who was driving the truck said there was an opening. So I applied. and I got the job. - Isn't that great? - Yes. - Yes. - This is great. this is very great! But the only thing is... ...I gotta start this alternoon. - Well. start! - Go lor it! Oh. boy. the giving just never stops around here. You know. I just leel like telling them to keep their darned old job. I'm just gonna stay here with you guys. But I can't. Guess it's time to start thinking about what's best lor Kyle Whitsett. So. anyway. this is goodbye. and thanks. - Bye. everybody. - Goodbye. Kyle. Murphy. I wanna thank you lor everything. I know that I'll never lorget you. Oh. God. I didn't wanna hurt you. I'll be okay. Good luck. Kyle. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Bye-bye! Eldin. my man. The boss is home. and she's on top ol the world. Tonight I've planned the perlect evening. I got some brownies. some ice cream... ...and I rented a copy ol The Producers. ll you promise not to talk during "Springtime For Hit|er," you can stay. No. thanks. I'm meeting my associates. Nickie and Maurice at the Blue Parrot. It's wet T-shirt night. ll chicks wear T-shirts. they get in lor lree. You wanna come? In another lile. What was that? Oh. this water delivery guy. He's been here lor. like. 20 minutes. Not counting the hall-hour I spent... ...trying to get his tie out ol the cassette player. Oh. no. it can't be. Hey. Mr. Painter. do you know where they keep the mop? I'll meet you in the car. Bye.
