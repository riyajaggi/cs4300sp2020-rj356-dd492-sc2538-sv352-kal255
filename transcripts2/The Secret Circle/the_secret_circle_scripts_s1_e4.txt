 The Secret Circle (2011–2012): Season 1, Episode 4 - Heather - full transcript 
 Cassie looks up an old friend of her mother's named Heather Barnes and discovers she has been in a catatonic state since the night of the fire 16 years ago. Feeling guilty that her mother and her Circle may have had something to do with Heather's current state, Cassie tells Diana that she wants to use magic to help Heather. Diana refuses to help, but Faye is more than happy to conjure up a spell - for a price.

The Secret Circle...
 My sweet Cassie,
 You finding this means
I'm gone,
 and for that,
I am so sorry.
 I didn't want you
to have this life.
 But destiny's not easy
to run from.
 Hi, I'm Diana.
 You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.
 We're different.
You're different.
 You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded, 100% witch.
 You're here.
We have real power now.
 A complete circle is 6.
 You complete the circle.
 She's got the gift.
 You can get Cassie
to do what we need?
 Circle will take care of that
without even knowing it.
 - How did you discover...
- We're witches.
 Diana found her mom's
Book of Shadows.
 She's the only one
with the book?
 That's the ferry that
killed her parents.
 Among the victims
was Heather Barnes.
 [Beep]
 Heather Barnes was on the
student council with Cassie's mom.
 I'm sorry Heather died!
 Heather didn't die.
What Amelia did to her
 was far worse.

 Do you like this?
 I just got it,

 I like it.
 Mmm.
 No, no, no, no.
 We're going to be
late for school.
 Come on.
I got a better idea.
 What could be better
than school?
 Open.
 Guess we're on the same page.
 Can't do magic alone, right?
 Think we can do
it again?
 Open.
 Open.

 Zachary said my mother
did something terrible
 to Heather Barnes.
 He said it was worse
than death.
 So, what did
you find out?
 After the fire, she spent two
years in a psychiatric hospital.
 Then she was released and just
dropped off the face of the Earth.
 Did she have any family?
 A brother in Finn Creek.
 No phone listing,
but he lives close to here.
 Want to go with me
after school, check it out?
 Yes, of course...
 Wait.
I can't go today.
 Can't go where?
 Hey, you!
 Finn Creek.
 Why do you wanna
go to Finn Creek?
 We're trying to find out what
happened to Heather Barnes.
 She has a brother there.
 And you think
he knows something?
 It's worth checking out.
 But I can go by myself,
not a big deal.
 You don't
wanna do that.
 Finn Creek is a sketchy area.
 Adam, why don't
you take her?
 I can't reschedule
my counselor eval.
 No, it's fine. Really.
 I'm fine.
 Heather was in that
fire 16 years ago.
 Maybe she can tell us what
happened to our parents.
 Sure.
 I'll pick you up
after school?
 Ok...
 It's ok. Really.
We're friends.
 We're in this together.
 Come on.
 [Sighs]
 I hate this binding stuff.
 What's the point of being
a damned witch if I can't
 do any magic by myself?
 I might as well
become a cheerleader.
 Bite your tongue.
 Why can't it be fun?
 Like that movie, "The Craft"?
 I mean the first half,
not the stuff with the snakes.
 The part where we put
spells on boys
 and change our hair color
and levitate.
 We should practice later.
 I'm kind of tied up...
 With what? Nick?
 Look, I know
you like this guy.
 But we both know
it's not going to last.
 He's a dog.
 That's not true.
He can be sweet.
 When he wants to get
into your pants.
 He hits on every girl
in school and you know it.
 Don't be "that" pathetic girl
 who thinks he'll
change "for me."
 They never change.
 Ok, I got it.
He's a loser.
 I'm a loser.
You feel better?
 Oh, this is looking more
and more like a bad idea.
 We'll be ok.
 What is this place?
 It used to be
a little fishing village
 but most people moved away
and this is what's left.
 [Dog barking in background]
 This is it.
 Hi, we're looking
for Wade Barnes.
 Actually, we were looking
for Heather Barnes.
 But we know
Wade lives here.
 I'm Wade. What do you
want with my sister?
 My mother, Amelia Blake,
was friends with Heather
 when they were young.
 [Sighs]
 You knew Amelia?
 I knew her.
 My mother died
a few months ago.
 I was hoping to ask
Heather a few questions.
 Do you know where she is?
 She's right here.
 Oh.
 Would it be all right
if we talked to her?
 No. It wouldn't.
 Maybe that's something
Heather should decide.
 You think so?
 Well, then come on in.
 Stop.
 Ask her anything
you want.
 Heather?
 She hasn't moved
in 16 years.
 What's wrong with her?
 Years back there was
a fire at the boat yard.
 We know.
 Some died
and some survived.
 If you call
this surviving.
 Do the doctors know
what caused it?
 No one does.
 She went there
with your mother.
 Why?
 I don't know.
 Of kids used to go
down to that boat yard
 to party and have fun.
 She was a different
person back then.
 I'm sorry.
 [Grunting]
Aah!
 Cassie, let's go!
 Aah!
[Grunting]
 Heather!

 What just happened?.
 You said she hasn't
moved in 16 years?
 Not at all.
Not a muscle.
 And then you come.
 What did you do?
 Nothing. This didn't have
anything to do with me.
 Well, she grabbed your arm.
Not mine and not his.
 Heather?
 Are you there? Hey.
 Heather, it's me.
Can you hear me?
 Heather? It's ok.
 We should go.
 I'm sorry, Mr. Barnes.
 I wish there was something
I could do to help.
 Ohh.
 That scar on her arm.
It's witchcraft, isn't it?
 It's a Sigil. They're
used for certain spells.
 I've seen them before
in our research.
 Do you think that's
what's wrong with her?
 A spell?
 Zachary said my mother
did something
 to Heather that was
worse than death.
 Is that what he meant?
 Cassie, I don't know.
 Is that why
she grabbed me?
 Because somehow she
knew I was related?
 It doesn't make sense.
 Heather was her friend.
 Why would she do
that to a friend?
 We don't know
your mother did this.
 No...I do know.
 Where's your grandmother?
 At the hospital.
Working the late shift.
 She's a nurse.
 I know.
When I was 10,
 she set my arm
when I broke it.
 I found this.
 Is that what I think it is?
 My family's
Book of Shadows.
 I found it
when I first got here.
 But how?
 My mother left it for me.
 She wanted me to find it.
 I haven't told anyone.
 Can I see it?
 Each of the six families
has their own book,
 but we've only
found Diana's.
 Everything we know about who
we are, we got from her book.
 But it's specific
to her family.
 Different spells,
different histories.
 This book is
completely different.
 We could learn
so much from this.
 The Sigil on Heather's arm...
I've seen it in here.
 Here.
 That's
my mother's handwriting.
 She had to be the one
to put the spell on Heather.
 I need to know why.
 It's a suppression
spell of some kind.
 Why would my mother do that?
 She would never hurt
someone like this.
 Not the mother I knew.
 I'm sorry, Cassie.
 Does it say how to undo it?
 Um...
 Right here, I think.
 I want to.
 If we can undo this spell, then
she can tell us what happened.
 If it even works.
 We have to try.
You saw that woman.
 If we can make her better,
we have to.
 ♪ I can't begin to... ♪
 Hey, what are you doing?
 Waiting for Nick.
I'm early.
 Listen, I wanted
to apologize about before.
 If you really like Nick,
then I'll get on board with it.
 I promise.
The last thing I'd want
 is for you to think
I was jealous of him.
 Thanks.
 Sure.
 And by the way...I think
Nick got here early, too.
 You're a bitch.
 [Scoffs]
 No. I'm you're friend.
 The spell requires a poultice.
 And that would be?
 A magic potion.
 And I'm being serious.
 I have most of the ingredients
here except the main one.
 Which is blood.
 The spell maker's. Yours.
 You're cool with that?
 And, um...
 My mom used her blood
to begin with, right?
 If it was her spell, she did.
 Hey, can you do it?
 Because I'm like
petrified of needles.
 Ok.
 Are you going to do it, or are
you just keep torturing me?
 Ok.
 How's that?
 Hey! You're here.
 Adam told me what
you want to do.
 Yeah, you should have
seen Heather Barnes.
 - We have to help her.
- Are you sure you are?
 We're going to undo the
spell that was put on her.
 I don't think it's a good idea.
 What if we do it wrong?
 What if it hurts her worse?
 We'll be careful.
 How do you even know
what you're doing?
 My book doesn't even tell you
how to undo a spell like this.
 My book does.
 You have a book?
 It was her mother's.
 She left it for her.
 It has the spell.
 You're the one who always wanted
to know what happened to our parents.
 Maybe we can find out
with the two books.
 Not now, Adam.
Not for this.
 It's too risky.
 I'm sorry, Cassie.
 You can't do the spell by
yourself and we can't help you.
 Adam?
 We can help her.
You didn't see her.
 What my mom did.
 Please?
 I'm sorry.
 Maybe when we understand more.
 But right now, we
just don't know enough
 to do something like this.
 Diana.
 Let me talk to her.
 Hey.
 You having
fun out there
 with your
little chipee?
 What are you talking about?
 I saw you talking
to that girl.
 You mean Andrea?
 Come on, Mel.
We were talking.
 Didn't look like you
were talking to me.
 So now I can't talk to girls?
Is that the deal now?
 You know, I was
hoping maybe to get
 5 minutes before you
turned into a douche.
 What's going on with you?
 I thought things were good.
 You know what?
Faye was right.
 You're never
going to change.
 Go find another
slut toy.
 I'm done.
 What are you doing here?
 Adam and Diana just left.
 Why so pouty?
 You wouldn't understand.
 Try me.
 Fine.
 I want to undo a spell that
could answer a lot of questions
 about how our parents
died 16 years ago
 and Diana and
Adam won't help me.
 Boy, did
I miss a chapter.
 Wait a minute, is
that a Book of Shadows?
 You have your own?
[Gasps]
 I have looked and looked
for my family's book
 and I can't find it.
 That's enough.
 Oh, come on, don't
be like that.
 I thought you needed help.
 You're going to help me?
 Sure. If you let me read
your book, why not?
 You need my help.
 And to be honest, I
have never understood
 why we're not
better friends.
 Let's go.
 You conveniently left out
the haunted house part.
 Yes.
 Come on.
 This is really creepy.
 Your mother did this?
 Why?
 I don't know. That's what
I'm hoping to find out.
 I mean, seriously.
 What could anyone
do to deserve...
 Your mother must have been
one mean ass witch--
 Faye. Please.
 Can we just try
to help her?
 I'm sorry.
 Let's do this.
 I'm going to apply the stuff
that Adam and I made
 and then we'll do
the chant together.
 Will it work?
 I have no idea.
 I don't know what
the spell is,
 I don't know
what the words mean,
 I don't even know how
to pronounce them.
 Ok, we can do this.
 You dragged me all
the way out here,
 so let's get
to the bottom of it.
 "Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia."
 "Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia."
 Again?
 Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia.
 Rongaire balorum
eunarach vicit romnia.
 [Sighs]
 I'm sorry.
 I thought it would work.
 [Door opens]
 [Rustling]
 Maybe we did it wrong?
 Or I screwed
up the potion?
 Can we talk about
this in the car?
 Far away from here.
 Thanks for trying.
 I know I don't come across
like I care about much...
 But my dad died that night.
 I don't think my mom's
ever gotten over it.
 And I want to know what
happened just as much as anyone.
 I guess we're all
in the same boat.
 Yep, a boat full of sad witches.
 So how about we go back to your
place and check out the book?
 Another time.
 I'd say I've earned
a peek, wouldn't you?
 Yes.
 [Squishing]
 [Gasps]
 Heather?
 Oh, my God.
 [Heather breathing
heavily]
 [Grunting]
 Heather, what
the hell's happening?
 Aah!
 [Dog barking in background]
 [Door opens]
 Waiting to
catch me cheating?
 I came to apologize.
 I overreacted.
 You think?
 I saw you with that other
girl and I just went off.
 I'm sorry.
 Yeah?
 Faye was saying some things and
I made the mistake of listening.
 Like what?
 [Sighs] It doesn't matter.
 Just stupid things.
 It's not like you're my
boyfriend or anything,
 so I don't have
the right to be jealous.
 Ok.
 So...We're good?
 Yeah. We're good.
 I'm sorry for putting
you in the middle
 of this thing with Cassie.
 I understand why you
don't want to do this.
 I just know how badly Cassie
wants to find answers.
 You know.
 Well, I'm glad she didn't.
 Because I went back
to my book.
 I knew there was something about
that symbol that bugged me.
 Look at this.
 These are all ubilaz markings.
 Uh...really old, black magic.
 Demons, evil
entities...Possession.
 Heather was possessed?
 [Inhales]
 The notes here are all
about using snakes and insects
 as vessels for dark energy.
 Forcing them inside someone.
 I think the Sigils are meant
to keep it from coming back out.
 Like a suppression spell.
 This is way beyond witchcraft.
 It's seriously dark magic.
 None of this was
in Cassie's book.
 If she'd known about this, she
never would have tried the spell.
 That's kinda
the point I was making.
 I've got to call her.
 Why? She didn't
do the spell.
 But she still
needs to know.
 Ok, that's enough for today.
 Oh, calm down.
 Or I can take it home with me
and be out of your hair.
 [Sighs]
 [Knock on door]
 Mmm.
 Will you bring me
back some snacks?
 No carbs.
 [Gasps]
 Where is Amelia?
 Can you help me
find Amelia?
 She's not here.
 How did you...
 Are you ok?
 I need to see her.
 Amelia passed away.
 No.
 I'm her daughter.
 Cassie.
 Cassie.
 You were a baby.
 I tried to help her
take you away.
 She did.
 She took me
far away from here.
 She wanted you
to be safe.
 She tried to
leave that night.
 What night?
 Do you mean
the night of the fire?
 Can you tell me
what happened that night?
 She was trying
to stop it.
 She wanted to protect us.
 All of us.
 But it went inside me.
 What did?
 Evil.
 And I can still feel it.
 It hurts.
 Aah!
 Your mother
couldn't get it out.
 But she made
the pain go away.
 And now it's come back.
 Ohh!
 Can you please help me?
 How? How can I?
 [Crying]
 Please...make it stop.
 [Screaming]
 [Line ringing]
 She's not picking up.
 [Vibrating]
 Ugh. Voicemail.
 Try again.
 [Vibrating]
 Ah.
 Hi, sweetie.
 What?
 Who is this?
 It's Cassie.
I miss you.
 Come make magic with me.
 Faye?
 Why is she answering
Cassie's phone?
 Faye, just put Cassie on.
 She's downstairs.
 Faye, this is important.
 Oh, you sound hot.
What are you wearing?
 Does Diana know
you're calling?
 Faye, please.
 What happened?
 You fainted.
 Is that what my mom did?
 Is this how she
stopped your pain?
 Yes.
 I went to the boat yard,
but I couldn't find her.
 Why was she there?
 How did the fire start?
 Wherever there are witches...
Evil follows.
 What do you mean?
 They'd been summoned.
 They were trying to
use your mother's power.
 Her and her friends.
 Who was? Why?
 She couldn't stop them all.
 And one of them
got inside me.
 One what?
 Heather, please, tell me who
she was trying to stop.
 Demons.
 [Breathing heavily]
 Heather!
 [Growling]
 Hey, Cassie, dream
boat's on the phone...
 Desperate for you.
 Cassie?
 Aah!
 Aah!
 Faye?
 Help! Oh, God.
 Aah!
 [Screaming]
 [Grunting]
 Aah!
 Faye!
 Faye? Wait.
 Aah!
 [Grunting]
 Aah!
Aah!
 [Screaming]
 Cassie: Come on!
 Come on, run!
 [Screaming]
 Back door.
 Front door. Run.
 [Screaming]
 It's me.
What's going on?
 Look behind you!
 Aah!
 Uh!
 Aah!
 Heather.
 Heather!
Heather, it's me.
 [Tires screeching]
 She came out of nowhere.
 [Police radio chatter]
 We have to take the
body now, Mr. Barnes.
 I'm so sorry, Mr. Barnes.
 She's at peace now.
 I'm glad you're ok.
 I am pretty far from ok.
 At least I'm alive. Thanks.
 Come on. I'll give you
a ride home.
 No thanks.
 I'll see you tomorrow.
 I'm sorry you had
to go through this.
 I still don't even get
what happened really.
 One minute she was
talking to me and then...
 I found the Sigil your
mother used to suppress
 the demon in
my Book of Shadows.
 A demon?
 That's what Heather said.
How can there be demons?
 I just know we
have to be careful.
 There's too much
we don't understand.
 What was I thinking?
 Taking any of this on
without knowing anything?
 You need answers.
We all do.
 I understand.
But after this,
 we just have to be
careful how we get them.
 We should go, Adam.
 My dad's going to worry.
 You're ok?
 Yeah.
 ♪ Oh, oh... ♪
 You were pretty
impressive back there.
 Thanks.
 So, are you
staying over?
 Yeah, if it's ok.
 I'm never going to be
the guy you want me to be.
 Is that a warning
or a threat?
 I'm going to disappoint you.
 You deserve better.
 That's the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.
 I'm not disappointed.
 ♪ I think I'm coming down ♪
 ♪ I think I'm comin' down... ♪
 [Knock on door]
 Hey.
 Where's Diana?
 I took her home.
 She knows you're here?
 No.
 I wanted to be
sure you're ok.
 And I thought you might need
some help cleaning up.
 That's what
friends do, right?
 You got a broom?
 Sure.
 I'm a witch.
 So, how many times did
Diana say, "I told you so?"
 Not once.
 Until right when she was
walking inside her house.
 Hey, I'm glad you
found out your mom
 was trying to
do the right thing.
 Me, too.
 But Diana was right.
 I was so determined
to find out about her,
 I put us all in danger.
 No, you were right.
 Maybe we didn't go
about it the right way,
 but a maniac came
after us at the dance.
 And tonight, a demon.
 A demon.
 We need to know what
happened 16 years ago.
 Our lives depend on it.
 I'm not sure
Diana agrees.
 Well, I agree.
 You do?
 After tonight? Yeah.
 What's out there is a lot bigger
than any of us ever thought.
 Thanks.
