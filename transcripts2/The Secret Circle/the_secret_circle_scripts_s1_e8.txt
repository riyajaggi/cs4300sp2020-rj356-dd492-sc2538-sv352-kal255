The Secret Circle...
 My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,
 and for that I am so sorry.
 I didn't want you
to have this life,
 but destiny's not easy
to run from.
 Hi. I'm Diana.
 - You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.
 - We're different.
- You're different.
 You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded 100% witch.
 Here we have
real power now.
 A complete circle is 6.
 You complete
the circle.
 She's got the gift.
 You can get Cassie
to do what we need?
 The circle will take care
of that without even knowing it.
 This is part of the blade
that girl used to attack me.
 That's it.
 The hunters.
 So the girl who attacked me
was a witch hunter.
 Cassie isn't like other witches,
Isaac.
 She's stronger.
 Henry?
 You shouldn't be here.
 Cassie has dark magic.
 No!
 Trust me now?
 You Ok?
 Last time I was here,
I was drugged, kidnapped,
 and almost killed.
 I can take you home if--
 No. I'm ok.
Thank You...
 Hey.
 Is your grandmother
home yet?
 No.
 I've tried calling her cell,
but nothing.
 Everyone else is here, though.
 Everyone except Melissa.
 Her mom's been worried
about her since Nick died.
 Took her out of town
for a while.
 - Hey.
Who invited Jake?
 Well, he's a part
of the circle.
 Jake was attacked
just like the rest of us.
 I keep feeling like the witch hunters
are going to come after us again.
 I don't think so.
I keep feeling like the witch hunters
are going to come after us again.
 I don't think so.
 At the shipyard, I heard them
say they were leaving town.
 They didn't seem like
the type to give up easily.
 If they wanted us dead,
wouldn't they just come
 back and try again?
 Maybe they got scared off
by your good friend
 Luke getting torched.
 Did anybody see
what happened to him?
 I think it had
to do with me.
 When he was about
to kill you,
 I--I yelled out,
and the bottle broke,
 and it just--
it feel like I had done it.
 But we were surrounded
by iron and sulfur.
 The circle couldn't do magic.
We--we tried.
 She wasn't talking
about the circle.
 You did magic
by yourself?
 It seemed like it.
 Has that happened to anybody
else since you bound the circle?
 I wouldn't be here
if I could do magic by myself.
 This is amazing.
 Jake says it's possible
to learn individual magic.
 Jake says?
 Since when are you in
a "Jake says" place?
 I've tried to do small spells
since, but nothing works.
 Like setting more classmates
on fire?
 Faye--
Doe-ey orphan Annie
 breezes into town,
 acting like she doesn't
know the difference
 between witchcraft
and Santa Claus.
 And now, she's more powerful
than any of us.
 Hold on. Cassie might have saved
our lives last night.
 Or maybe it's all her fault
they're here in the first place.
 Psychos,
witch hunters, demons--
 they all started coming
after us after you came to town.
 Actually, it was after we bound
the circle.
 Which we didn't do
until after she arrived.
 I don't know if
this is going to help.
 Calvin, the guy
at the antique shop,
 he put this in my mailbox,
said it was important.
 Can I see that?
 I've never seen anything like these
symbols before.
 "J.B."?
 I think it stands for Jane Blake,
my grandma.
 She knows him.
 What did Calvin say
about it?
 Nothing. And I tried calling him,
but no answer.
 Sort of like
your grandmother.
 She definitely should have
been home by now.
 I'm thinking I'd better go up to
your grandfather's place.
 - Make sure she's Ok.
- I'll go with you.
 Wait a minute.
It's my family's house,
 and I'm the one that knows how
to get there.
 Maybe we should all go.
 The further we are from the
witch hunters, the better.
 Did you do something
to Jane Blake?
 No. After your failed attempt
on the circle,
 we've been forced
underground. Why?
 She went to see Henry Chamberlain.
And now, she's missing.
 Two elders, together.
 Could they be
practicing again?
 Cassie and the others are going to
the lake house to check on her.
 I'll go and see
what I can find out.
 They still trust you
after last night's attack?
 They're scared.
 No one's looking for a threat
inside the circle.
 Maybe Adam,
but I can handle him.
 Tell me he doesn't
have dark magic.
 I think Cassie's
the only one.
 You're intrigued by her.
 The closer I get to her,
 the closer I get to
knowing how to kill her.

 Mom?
 Yeah?
 Have you heard
from grandpa?
 Not recently. Why?
 Cassie says Jane went up
to see him, and now,
 she's not answering
her cell.
 Well, cell service up there
is a little iffy.
 I'm sure they're fine.
 Cassie Blake is
all drama, all the time,
 and she wants to drive
out there and check.
 And it's our lake house, so.
 Exams are coming up.
 You promised you'd stay home
and study.
 It's just for the day.
 Faye, it's
a 3-hour drive.
 And I've driven it
by myself how many times?
 If it makes you feel any better,
a bunch of us are going.
 I'm sure your grandfather
doesn't want to deal with
 a car full of teenagers.
 Mom,
what's the big deal?
 No a big deal.
Just be safe.
 I will call as soon
as I get there.
 And I'll tell grandpa
you say hi, and you miss him.
 You totally
car-blocked me.
 Jake's supposed
to give me a ride.
 Jake and Cassie are neighbors.
I told them to go together.
 I'm impressed.
 - What's that supposed to mean?
- It means even though
 you and Adam gave back
your promise rings,
 you still want the competition
in the other car.
 Convenient.
 Did you reach Henry?
 No, but unlike Cassie,
I'm not freaking out.
 He lives in a house
on 200 acres
 where he still chops
his own wood.
 Hardly the kind of guy
who waits by the phone.
 I'm sure he's fine.
 Where are you?
 We have a situation
on our hands.
 Should be home soon.
 Do you have
Jane's phone?
 Pretty sure
it's in the back.
 Look, I need you
to text Cassie
 and tell her that
Jane's home already.
 Why?
 She told Cassie she was going to
the lake house.
 The kids are headed up there
to check on her.
 When we made Henry's death look
like a heart attack,
 the idea was that the neighbor
would find him, not Faye.
 She won't.
 Jane was performing
a spell over his body
 when I got there,
and I didn't want to risk
 leaving behind
any signs of magic.
 No one will find
his body. I moved it.
 It's better with
the kids gone.
 It gives us time to figure out
what to do with Jane.
 Storm coming.
 You think?
What gave it away--
 the clouds
or the thunder?
 I'm sure you're grandmother's
all right, Cassie.
 Sorry.
 I'm just a little short
on family members,
 so when one goes missing,
it stresses me out.
 I hear you.
I'm a little short myself.
 I'm sorry.
No worries.
 You know, I see the way you
react when people talk about Nick.
 And you pretend not
to care, but you do.
 Yeah. I guess I wish
we'd reconnected sooner.
 I could've helped him deal with
everything, with witchcraft.
 I thought you didn't want him
getting into it.
 But he did.
 So maybe opening up
could've helped him
 understand who he was.
 How about you?
 Does Jane ever talk about
your family and magic?
 Not much.
 She said our family can
be traced back to the
 beginning of witchcraft.
 Mom or dad's side?
 Why are you suddenly
so interested in
 climbing my family tree?
 Old magic is powerful.
 Tracing it back
might help you understand
 why you're able
to do it on your own.
 Maybe those papers have
something to do with it.
 Maybe.
 I'll look at them again. Maybe
I can figure out what they say.
 I, uh--
I left them at home.
 Right now, I just--
I need to find my grandmother.
 Of course.
 And we're almost
there, anyway.
 Hey, you made it!
 It doesn't look like
anyone's home.
 Faye says there's
a key under here.
 Help! Help me! Somebody!
 What's
she doing?
 Faye!
 Faye!
 Are you Ok?
 Fine.
 Somebody,
please help me!
 Did anyone just hear
a little girl's voice?
 A little girl?
 Never mind.
 No lights.
 Power goes out a lot
when it rains.
 There are some candles
in the chest right there.
 Grandpa?
 Grandpa?
 Doesn't seem like
anybody's here,
 unless your grandpa
likes to sit in the dark.
 Wow.
That's an old one.
 Hey, that's
my grandmother's scarf.
 Where could they have gone
in this weather?
 Maybe into town.
 Want to try
and call her again?
 Yeah. Well,
she--she texted me.
 "Cell service spotty here.
Stopped to see a friend on
 the way back from the lake.
 Be home tomorrow."
There you go.
 Now, no more
worrying tonight.
 Did she say anything
about my grandfather?
 No. But they
might be together.
 Ew.
 I'll go look for some food
in the kitchen.
 We can head back now,
if you want.
 I don't know.
It's still pouring,
 and Jane's not going to be
home until tomorrow, anyway.
 We may as well
stay the night.
 Great idea.
 There's a generator
in the shed out back.
 Maybe get that going,
get us some lights.
 And I'll go see what the old
man has in his liquor cabinet.
 Now you're talking.
 Are there any more
flashlights?
 Check under the sink
in the kitchen.
 What the hell took you
so long?
 I've been
a little busy, Dawn.
 What did you do
with Jane?
 She's safe. Knocked out
with a few sleeping pills.
 She'll be out for
hours. Trust me.
 What are we going to do?
 What can we do?
We have no magic.
 Oh, my God.
 You found it.
 Actually, Jane did.
 Henry had it in
some hidden compartment.
 We've got to figure out
a way to control Jane's memory.
 We have the crystal.
 But we still need
a spell.
 And I know where
we can find one.
 You know, I think
Jake has a thing for you.
 No. Definitely not.
 Really?
 Finally.
 I need a drink
or several.
 I'm going to text my mom
before I get a buzz
 so she knows
we're staying the night.
 Then I'm going to take
a hot bath.
 I got soaked,
and I'm freezing.
 Come on. No applause?
We made light.
 Ah. Nice work.
Now we need a fire
 to get
this place warm.
 I'll be in the tub,
if you need me.
 Give me a hand
with drinks.
 I'll help.
 Sure.
 I know a better way
to start the fire.
 Oh, really.
 A spell.
 I don't know. Playing with fire,
and all that.
 Come on.
 Doing magic with someone can
tell you a lot about them.
 Like what?
 Let's try it and see.
 It won't hurt.
I promise.
 All right.
 From air to fire--
 No chanting.
 What?
 Just picture it.
 No words.
 Whoa.
 That was intense.
 Mmm.
 Everything looks
normal.
 But it--it was filled
with mud and weeds.
 Maybe you had
a few sips too many.
 I'm not drunk.
 - Did you fall asleep?
- No.
 - Forget the whole thing.
- Just get out. Ok.
 Ok.
 Did you do this?
 What?
 You're the only one around
here with individual magic.
 You said it yourself.
The voices, the boots.
 What are you
talking about?
 Are you messing
with me?
 Maybe trying
to make me look crazy
 so you can have Jake
all to yourself?
 Faye,
you're being ridiculous.
 I didn't do anything.
 This is where I followed them
after the binding ceremony.
 You sure
they're not coming back?
 Yeah. Faye's text said they
were all spending the night.
 "Crowley's 777,"
 "Holden's Spellcraft."
They've got the basics.
 Look at all of this.
Plants, herbs, tools.
 Takes me back to earlier days,
 when we started hanging out
together, learning the craft.
 Yes, before Blackwell.
 When it was still fun.
 Diana doesn't keep her book
at home anymore.
 After the circle was bound,
she kept it close.
 But a group trip,
in a car...
 If I know my daughter,
 she'd would have left it
safely behind,
 where the others
couldn't get to it.
 Umbra libre invenio.
 Umbra libre invenio.
 Umbra libre...
 Impressive.
 We should take
the book with us.
 We'll make sure it's back before
the kids return.
 No. We'll find
the spell we need,
 but this is where Diana puts
her book for safekeeping,
 and this is
where it stays.
 You should give me
the crystal now, Charles.
 - I'll hold onto it.
- I don't think so.
 You haven't been
yourself lately, Charles,
 which is completely
understandable.
 But I think it's for the best,
for both of us,
 if I keep the crystal.
 I was upset
after Nick's death.
 But I found this crystal,
 and it gives me hope that things
can get put back on track.
 So please, don't talk to me like
I'm one of your students, Dawn.
 I don't like it.
 This time,
the crystal stays with me.
 This time,
I do what I want.
 You don't stop me.
 Within reason,
of course.
 So, Diana...
 Truth or dare?
 I cannot believe
we're doing this.
 First of all,
there's no TV or Internet.
 And second, what better way
to get to know each other?
 Truth or dare?
 Dare.
 Hmm.
 I dare you to
 take your shirt off
for the next 3 questions.
 Loosen up a little.
 - No way.
- That's no fair.
 Well, the game's not
called truth or fair.
 Are you going
to play or not?
 Cheating.
 This doesn't seem
like a good idea.
 My turn. Faye,
truth or dare.
 Truth.
 How many people have
you slept with?
 How about
a dare instead?
 Those aren't
the rules, Faye.
 Do you want
to play or not?
 Fine.
 Two.
 Ooh, guess I'm not
the super-slut
 you all think I am.
Or I'm lying.
 Who's next?
How about--
 Jake.
Truth or dare.
 Bring it.
 Truth.
 Why didn't
the witch hunters put you
 in the circle
with the rest of us?
 Come on, Adam.
No witch hunter talk. Please.
 He already
explained that.
 Probably because I'm
stronger than the rest of you.
 Took more guys
to hold me down.
 I don't believe you.
 Way bored
of macho tension.
 Moving on to...Cassie.
 Truth or dare?
 But truth is a two-parter.
 Do you ever plan
on going after a guy
 one of us hasn't slept with?
 Or is it just other people's
boyfriends that turn you on?
 Faye, shut up.
 Cassie can defend herself,
Adam.
 Dare.
 Better choice.
 I dare you to...
 Kiss Jake.
 You are a one-woman
relationship wrecking crew.
 And you are a bitchy,
spoiled little girl
 who wants to blame me
for all of your problems
 instead of just
looking in the mirror.
 Faye!
 Just let her go.
 Oh!
 Pull back your claws.
I'm not Faye.
 Sorry. She just knows
how to push my buttons.
 That's what
Faye does best.
 What's the deal
with you two, anyway?
 What do you mean?
Nothing.
 She acts like you're still together.
Are you?
 No. Faye likes to think
our relationship was
 more interesting and complicated
than it was.
 I don't even think of it
as a relationship.
 Mmm.
Spoken like a true guy.
 I like this side of you.
 You're cute
when you're angry.
 Spoken like
a true cheeseball.
 All that emotion swirling
inside you right now?
 Accessing that is
the key to solo magic.
 Anger, pain, passion.
 It's like rocket fuel.
 If that were true,
Faye would've bailed
 on the circle
a long time ago.
 Not all witches are
created equal.
 You can practice,
but true power is
 something you're born with.
 Like you were.
 I don't know that
for sure.
 I think you do.
Deep down.
 You're just afraid
to go there.
 You really are
a cheeseball.
 Not afraid?
 Try a spell on your own.
 Why do you care?
 Maybe
I'm just interested.
 Then show me.
 I've been accused of doing
a lot of things tonight.
 Maybe I should
try at least one of them.
 Cassie, stop.
 Um. I should go get
the rest of my stuff.
 Where are you going?
 To get firewood.
 Are you mad at me? Why?
I didn't do anything.
 You defended her.
 And you looked away 'cause you
couldn't handle seeing them kiss.
 I looked at you,
not away.
 I was trying to show you
how much I didn't care.
 If you really didn't care,
you wouldn't have to force
 yourself not to look.
 I know you, Diana.
 You set that up
on purpose.
 You think?
 Altering the fabric
of time and space
 to ensure your destiny
with Cassie?
 Oh, come on.
 Daring them to kiss.
 It doesn't matter
how I reacted.
 You just wanted
a reason to be angry.
 You think I like
feeling this way?
 I think you want
a reason to push me away.
 I shouldn't want to.
 That's not a good
relationship sign, is it?
 Just talk to me.
 Adam, you're just
used to us, that's all.
 That's why this is so important.
You're afraid of change.
 - That is pathetic.
- Excuse me?
 Cassie has made you feel
the tiniest bit of doubt
 for the first time
in your life,
 and it freaks you out
so much, you need
 to turn me into
an emotional loser?
 Screw you.
It's not Cassie
 who makes made me
feel insecure-- it's you.
 If you really
wanted me gone,
 you wouldn't have to try so
hard to convince yourself.
 Well, you're the only one
who needs convincing.
 You're the one
chasing me out here.
 Yes, I am.
 Faye?
 You out here?
 Faye?
 Faye?
 Hi. Are you Ok?
 Hey, wait for me.
 Oh, my God, Faye.
You scared me.
 There's a little girl
out here.
 You could see her?
 Yes. Just a second ago.
 And there's a picture of her in
your grandfather's study.
 Who is she?
 She's...Me.
 I can't explain it.
 All I know is
that little girl is me.
 Come on, Faye.
That's not possible.
 I get that.
 But I remember the last time
I wore that exact outfit.
 Those boots,
that raincoat.
 I was 6, I was here
for the summer, and...
 I wandered out down
to the lake by myself.
 Faye, it's not you.
 It's dark. It's late.
It's been a weird night.
 I was throwing rocks
into the lake,
 and I walked out onto the dock so
I could throw them even further.
 And I was standing
right up to the edge--
 Let's go get
Adam and Diana.
 I reached back and threw one
as hard as I could,
 and then suddenly, I was
underwater, and I couldn't breathe.
 And then, I remember
trying to scream,
 and--and water rushing
into my lungs.
 I could feel my whole body
shutting down.
 And I remember
the panic.
 I was so scared.
 Faye. Please, stop.
Stop, stop.
 And then...
 there was
a hand on my arm.
 And I was yanked up
and thrown onto the dock.
 It was my grandfather.
 He saved my life.
 That girl is here
for a reason.
 I won't lie Jane.
I've never really liked you.
 And not just because you and
the elders took away our power--
 which, of course,
would be reason enough.
 Long before that,
I always found you to be
 smug and self-righteous.
 And dull.
 Which is why I'm so pleased
with this spell.
 I think that
after I'm able to control
 the things that
you say and do,
 we're going to be
great friends. Hmm?
 And isn't that what
it's all about? Friendship?
 I am sure you'll agree...
 in just a few minutes.
 Faye, wait!
 - Did you hear that?
- What?
 She fell into the lake.
 Where are you?
Can you hear me?
 There's no one
out there.
 What's going on?
 She saw something
or someone.
 You saw her, too!
 - Saw what?
- I don't know.
 A little girl,
I think. Maybe.
 She fell in the water.
We have to find her.
 There's no one in there.
Let's go back inside.
 Wait! Let go of me!
She fell into the water.
 Faye,
whatever she is,
 she's not in the water, Faye.
I promise.
 Yes, she is! She fell in the water!
We have to find her!
 What's the matter?
 Get off me!
Get him off of me!
 Lay off.
Get him off me!
 All right,
let go of her!
 Get him off me!
Let go of her!
 Hey, lay off!
 She's in there, and she wanted
to tell me something.
 She wanted to
tell me something!
 She's in the water!
She's in the--
 She wanted to tell me--
 Cassie saw her, too!
Cassie saw her, too!
 Calm down.
 I know.
I believe you.
 Let's get you
back to the house.
 Let's get you
dry.
 Diana, take her hand.
Hold onto her.
 Cassie?
 It was cut loose.
 That's my grandpa.
 Mommy.
 He's gone.
 I'm so sorry, Faye.
 You Ok?
 I just can't believe
he's dead.
 He used Faye's own memories
to reach out to her.
 How is that possible?
 Sometimes,
when a witch dies,
 their energy
hangs around.
 It can still be
pretty powerful.
 The amazing part is that you
saw what Faye was seeing.
 I felt like
we were linked.
 The little girl...
or Faye...
 called me out
to the dock.
 Seeing someone
else's memories?
 That's some
big time magic.
 When I reached my hand
into the water,
 I knew exactly
what to do.
 But I have no idea how.
 What?
 You're looking at me
like I'm a freak.
 Not a freak.
Just...
 Surprising.
 Well, I guess
I can live with that.
 Hey, you know, we could drive
to the boathouse.
 Make you
some breakfast.
 Adam,
what happened last night...
 It was pretty good.
 It was great.
 But it was the last time.
 We can't just go back
to the way things were.
 Being with you is
all I know,
 but I don't know
if it's right anymore.
 I do.
 I know
for both of us.
 Adam, we have to find out
what it feels like
 to really be apart.
 It's the only way
we'll ever find out
 if we're meant
to be together.
 I don't want you
to find out...
 You're okay without me.
 How was your trip?
 Instructive.
 Do share.
 Cassie's magic is stronger than
anything I've ever experienced.
 And?
 Someone killed
an elder--
 Henry Chamberlain.
 But they didn't
do it right.
 His energy came back
and led us straight to his body.
 Who's responsible?
 I don't know.
 But there are other forces
in play besides us.
 Someone else is
targeting witches.
 Then we need
to strike now--
 kill Cassie and her circle
and move on.
 There's something
about Cassie I'm missing.
 The antiquities dealer
left her some kind of warning.
 I need to figure out
what it is.
 No. It's time for
the witches to die.
 And all that's left
for you to do
 is to decide whether
you're still one of them.
 - Hi.
- Grandma.
 Good morning,
sweetheart.
 Oh, how are you?
 Something terrible
has happened.
 It's Henry.
 He's dead.
 Oh, my God.
 He was killed.
 I was just there.
 I assumed when he didn't answer,
he was away.
 You didn't see him?
 I never even
made it inside.
 But I found your scarf
inside his house.
 Isn't this yours,
isn't it?
 Yes, it is.
 That's strange.
 Yeah. It is.
