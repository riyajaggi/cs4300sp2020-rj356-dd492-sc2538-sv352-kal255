 The Secret Circle (2011–2012): Season 1, Episode 7 - Masked - full transcript 
 Adam dismisses his father as hopeless drunk, who wrecked his life especially since mother's death, yet follows hid advice to accept Diana being his fated mate by their witch families' destiny. The kids circle prepares a 'regular' Halloween party, with a few ordinary dates and other guests, so no magic. Jake is invited and prepares a plan, despite senior with hunter Isaac's doubts, to eliminate all five witches using a blood spell. Cassie is on the hunters' tail and tracks down the magically marked ritual knife. Jake manages to remain undiscovered after eliminating minor witch shop keeper Wilson when Cassie's black magic puts his undercover fellow Luke on fire. Grandmother Blake finds old Henry dead and attempts reviving him with crystal magic.

The Secret Circle...
 My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,
 and for that I am so sorry.
 I didn't want you
to have this life,
 but destiny's not easy
to run from.
 Hi. I'm Diana.
 - You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.
 - We're different.
- You're different.
 You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded 100% witch.
 Here we have
real power now.
 A complete circle is 6.
 You complete
the circle.
 She's got the gift.
 You can get Cassie
to do what we need?
 The circle will take care
of that without even knowing it.
 There was a guy in
Nick's yard last night.
 It must have been
his older brother Jake.
 He left town
a couple of years ago.
 He was
a troubled young man.
 - What do you want?
- Your blood.
 Aah!
Get off of her.
 We did a spell together to send
her away.
 So, you know
you're a witch.
 Your dad told me
about you and Cassie
 being destined
to be together.
 I've been standing on
the sidelines
 watching it
since she got here.
 I can't do that anymore.
 I've come here to rid
Chance Harbor of witches,
 and I will not fail.
 What do you think?
 Those are
ancient artifacts,
 not a Halloween costume.
 Whatever. I'm
a sexy witch Doctor.
 Take it off.
 We shouldn't be drawing
attention to ourselves.
 Relax, it's Halloween.
 We're just
blending in
 with all the supernatural
wannabes.
 And is there
a more perfect place
 for party decorations?
 Uh, no, we're
not having a party.
 Just a get-together.
 That was the deal.
 My grandmother's
only gone for the night.
 I know. And I'm impressed
that you agreed
 without me having
to resort to blackmail.
 No, I just-- I think it'll be
a good break for us.
 Halloween's the night to pretend
you're someone else, right?
 Sluttier versions
of someone else,
 but I get
your point.
 And maybe it'll be good
for Adam and Diana.
 Is that what
this is about?
 You feel bad about
breaking them up,
 and now, you're
throwing a party
 to lure them
back together?
 No, I did not
break them up.
 I think that the best way
to cover up the fact
 that you tried to
steal her boyfriend
 is to get
one of your own.
 How about Luke?
 I--pfft! No.
 I blew my chance
when I became
 the world's worst
dance date.
 Ecch.
 Luke.
 Hi.
 So, Cassie's having
a party tonight,
 and she would love
for you to come.
 No, it is just
a--a get-together.
 And I totally understand
if you don't want to,
 or if you have
other, better plans.
 Sure.
 Ok.
 So, I'll see you tonight?
 See you then.
 And now, you have
a hot guy to flirt with
 at the party.
 Done.
 So what about you?
 I have
a target in mind.
 - Jake?
- Maybe.
 Let me change out
of these artifacts.
 Will you buy
this for me?
 As a reward for
being so helpful?
 Um, hmm.
 Hi. Happy
Halloween.
 Mm-hmm.
 Thank you.
 Blake?
 Any relation
to Amelia Blake?
 She was my mother.
 Well.

 Wilson's.
 It's been there
as long as I can remember.
 The guy who owns the place
seemed to know me.
 Or at least
knew mom.
 Calvin Wilson.
 Is he one of us?
 A witch?
 Yes. Why, did he
say something to you?
 No. I touched his hand
by mistake,
 and then, the mirror
behind him shattered.
 It was really strange.
 Residual power
and active power crossing.
 It could've just been
a random surge.
 How many witches are there in
Chance Harbor?
 Hard to know exactly.
 People tend to be
private about it.
 But a lot less than
there used to be.
 After the fire, everyone stopped
practicing.
 Many families left town.
 Right. Like us.
 I'd better get going
to Henry's lake house.
 It's a long drive.
 You sure you're going
to be ok here?
 Absolutely.
 Henry's an elder,
isn't he?
 Well, I just thought that you
didn't want to tell anyone
 that we'd bound the circle,
especially elders.
 I'm not going to tell
him about the circle.
 But I haven't heard
from him in weeks,
 and I'm worried.
 You have friends coming to stay
with you here, right?
 Yeah.
All the girls will be here.
 We're going to do
a low-key Halloween thing,
 like hand out candy
to trick-or-treaters
 and watch some movies.
 Good.
 Bye, grandma.
 Morning.
 Thought you'd still
be sleeping it off.
 I'm fine.
 The keys to the boathouse
weren't on the hook.
 You forget to put them back,
I guess.
 Sorry about that.
 And I appreciate the concern,
but I'm fine.
 Do you remember that
Diana broke up with me
 'cause you told her how Cassie
and I were written in the stars?
 I know it's hard
to understand.
 No,
I understand perfectly.
 Since you've already ruined
your life,
 you've decided
to destroy mine.
 That's not fair.
 Diana loved me.
 And the more I tried
to be worthy of it,
 the better I got, and the
further I got from being you.
 I don't want you to
be me either. Trust me.
 But messing with fate
will get you there
 faster than you know.
 Please stop using fate
as an excuse for what
 you did to mom.
 Did you ever
even love her?
 'Cause the way
you talk about Amelia,
 it doesn't seem like it.
 You got a lot
of great stuff.
 Thanks for coming over
to help set up.
 No problem.
I love Halloween.
 And I could use
the distraction.
 Have you and Adam talked
at all since the wake?
 No.
 I wish I could help somehow--
 I don't even want
to talk about it.
 I shouldn't have
brought it up.
 Oh, of course. Sorry.
 Ok. I know there's
a big bag of plastic cups
 somewhere in here.
 What is that?
 Uh, zombie?
 Got it from
the drama club.
 This is just
the beginning.
 There's
a trunkload of stuff.
 Faye invited them so they'd let
us take as much as we wanted.
 Oh, my God.
 What's wrong?
 This is part of the blade
that girl used to attack me.
 It must have broken off.
 It looks old.
 That's the Crescent moon symbol
she burned in the ground.
 Hey.
 Happy Halloween.
 First one as a witch,
very important.
 Yes. Thanks.
 Uh, I found something.
 What is it?
 It's a piece of the weapon
that girl used to attack me.
 Found it in the kitchen.
 Where are you taking it?
 Just the antiquities shop
by the boardwalk.
 Thought I'd try
to figure out what it is
 and what these
two symbols mean.
 You sure that's
a good idea?
 It might tip off
who you really are.
 And that witch is gone,
 so there's not much
to do about it, anyway.
 I told you
the night she died
 that there's too much
I don't know about witchcraft.
 It's time I learned.
 I don't want us to be
sitting targets anymore.
 I get that.
 I'll be careful about
what I tell him. Don't worry.
 Let me know how it goes.
 I'll see you later?
 Sorry,
I'm closed for lunch.
 Thought I locked up.
 You did.
 Calvin Wilson, right?
 That's right.
 I made
a couple of calls
 and found out that
the Wilsons have been
 around this area
forever.
 A long time.
 Maybe you knew
my parents?
 Richard
and Sara Armstrong?
 No.
 I didn't really know
them, either.
 I was pretty young
when they died.
 I'm sorry.
 Me, too.
 But that's not
why I came here.
 Do you have any
witch cruets?
 Excuse me?
 I have a few, but I'm always
looking for more.
 I use them
for salad dressing,
 but apparently, they're
meant for killing witches.
 Is that right?
 All you need is
mandrake root
 and some blood.
 Ahh!
 And a personal item
 that's absorbed some
of the witch's energy.
 Please.
It's my wedding ring.
 Then as long as
the cruet's been spelled,
 all you have to do next
is throw in a match,
 and ding dong,
the witch is dead.
 But you knew that,
didn't you?
 You're not a very
powerful witch, are you, Calvin?
 If Cassie Blake comes in here
and asks any questions,
 all you're going
to say is, "I don't know."
 Got it?
 Yes. I swear it.
 Great.
 Probably best you don't
carry these in your shop.
 Dangerous things.
 Mr. Wilson?
 Oh.
 You were here
this morning.
 I have something
to show you.
 I'm a little busy here.
 Ok. Well, can you
just tell me what it is?
 I don't know.
 I wish I could be
more helpful.
 Hmm. Ok.
 Well, if you--if you
think of anything, then, um...
 I will write down my
name and my number,
 and you can call me.
 All right.
 Oh, my God.
I--that was so dumb.
 I'm sorry.
Can I help you clean it up?
 Do you have, like,
a broom or something?
 Of course,
I will pay for it.
 Never mind.
I'll do it.
 Jake.
 You miss him, too?
 Not exactly.
 I'm here for them.
 Look, you don't have
to be all tough.
 We both loved him.
 I hadn't seen Nick
in two years.
 When I was living here, all
we did was fight.
 So take this trip down
memory lane by yourself.
 Wow.
 Great Big Brother.
 He was playing with things that
he shouldn't have.
 He wound up dead.
 I could've told him.
 But you weren't here
to do that.
 You just left.
 So maybe this is on you.
 You know,
I actually thought
 we might be able
to be friends,
 that we had
something in common.
 I'm nothing like
the rest of you.
 Trust me.
 Ok. See how close
you can get to this one,
 the third symbol.
 It could be
an old crest.
 People used to etch them
into objects of all kinds.
 It's like
a family seal.
 All right. I recreated the images
on the sketch pad app
 and ran a search.
 Might take a few minutes
to scan for matches.
 I--I called Diana,
she should be here, too.
 If she knows I'm here,
she won't come.
 I don't blame her.
 Ever since I was little,
 my dad would talk about
 how he was supposed
to be with Amelia,
 and how I'm fated to be
with Amelia's daughter.
 I should have known he'd
say it to Diana, too.
 But this breakup isn't
his fault--it's mine.
 The only reason Diana
believed what he said is
 because it's the way
I've been acting.
 I'm sorry for anything I did
to make that worse.
 I don't know what's between you
and me, exactly.
 But I know that without Diana,
I'm not much of anything.
 Then you should fight
for her.
 Show her that.
 Forbidden love.
So adorable.
 Am I interrupting?
 Uh, no, no.
 Did you find anything
in my book about
 the symbols on the blade?
No.
 But I did find a cool attraction
spell for future reference.
 I got a match.
 That's it.
 Does it belong to
any family name?
 Not a family. A society.
 The Geticas,
also known as "The Hunters."
 This goes back all the way
to the Middle Ages.
 Hunters?
 Its motto is
from ancient text--
 "Thou shalt not suffer
a witch to live."
 So the girl who attacked me
wasn't a crazy witch.
 She was a witch hunter.
 Adam Conant...
 Diana Meade...
 Faye Chamberlain...
 Melissa Glaser...
 and Cassie Blake.
 As angry as you were
at Simone for hurrying
 along the process,
 at least
she did the marking.
 Now you don't have to.
 Simone ignored the plan.
 She could have ruined
everything.
 If you kill a bound
witch the wrong way,
 their powers can pass
to other witches,
 make them stronger.
 We can't afford
mistakes.
 Which is why some of us
are worried about a plan
 that hinges on you.
 Witchcraft took my parents
and my brother.
 I know
which side I'm on.
 Now, do you want me
to do this or not?
 Because if I don't spell these,
they're just fancy bottles,
 and you're back to
burning witches at the stake.
 Go ahead.
 Spell the vessels.
 Let light rise
out of darkness.
 Let light rise
out of darkness.
 Let light rise
out of darkness.
 Let light rise
out of darkness.
 Let light rise
out of darkness.
 It's done.
 Add their blood,
the objects,
 set it on fire,
 they die.
 And their magic dies
with them.
 Good.
 We can't risk outing you
in the process.
 So, we'll have some brothers
at the party,
 doing the gathering
for you.
 Ian came with us
from Salem.
 And one of our hunters
is from here in town.
 He's very familiar
with the targets.
 That girl lied to you.
She wasn't a witch.
 What are you
talking about?
 We found out
what those symbols mean.
 - And?
- She was a witch hunter.
 Wait.
If she was a witch hunter,
 why would she bother
lying to me?
 I don't know.
 Are you sure she didn't say
anything else to you?
 No, just exactly
what I told you.
 - Hmm.
- How do you know
 she wasn't just
some crazy witch?
 What else have you
really got to go on?
 Just those 3 symbols?
 Um, I'll see you
at the party tonight?
 I might drop by.
 Yeah.
 You know, it's times like this
I pity the normals.
 They will never be
this cool.
 What else can we do?
Bats.
 Take flight and dive.
 Take flight and dive.
 Ohh!
 Aah!
 Wow, nice work.
 Um, hey, look,
when Jake shows up,
 do you think you can
keep him occupied?
 Why do you think
I'm wearing this?
 Oh. Right.
 Wait, why do you
want him occupied?
 When I showed him the fleam,
he knew that there were
 3 symbols when mine
was missing one.
 He obviously knows more
than he's telling us.

 Is this who we are now?
We don't even talk?
 What's left that
you want me to say?
 Tell me
how to fix this.
 Adam, don't.
 I love you.
 So if I let you
forget that...
 Then let me try again.
 I know
we can work it out.
 We shouldn't have
to work so hard.
 Not everything is perfect,
Diana.
 Sometimes--sometimes,
things get a little out of control.
 But that doesn't mean
it's wrong.
 Like Cassie?
 Whiskey, neat, right?
 Good memory.
I'm impressed.
 Don't be.
 What brings you
across town?
 Can't an old friend
just stop by for a visit?
 Not after 16 years, no.
 Maybe I wasn't in
your circle,
 but I never gave you
a reason not to trust me.
 You shouldn't
have come here.
 Well, it wasn't on
the top of my list, either,
 but Amelia Blake's daughter came
to my store this morning.
 Really.
Why's that?
 Thought you might know.
 She was asking questions
about some old hunting
 acquaintances of ours.
 It's funny.
 I couldn't see much of
her mother in her, at first,
 not until she told me
who she was.
 You know how it is
with kids.
 It's hard to predict
which parent they'll favor.
 She's Amelia's daughter,
Cal.
 Are you sure?
 'Cause you were always a bit blind
when it came to Amelia.
 We were all blind except Amelia,
in the end.
 She doesn't even know who her
father really was, does she?
 What he was attempting
to do that night?
 And there's no reason
she should.
 Why not?
 Especially if she's as much like
Amelia as you say.
 Just leave it alone.
 She needs to know
about John Blackwell.
 She has a right
to protect herself.

In my bedroom?
 What the hell is going on
with you?
 Come on, Faye.
 Don't try and deny
something's going on.
 Is this going
to be drama?
 No. No drama.
 But something's
different with you.
 You were always an ass,
 and you always had
a cruel streak.
 But you were never
distant.
 Not when
we were like this.
 Maybe you just always thought
there was more there,
 and there wasn't.
 No. I've felt it
since you got back.
 Looking for something?
 Uh, just Nick's MP3 player,
for Melissa.
 You know, their songs?
I thought it might help her.
 Did you think
stabbing it to death
 would get her
the closure she needs?
 No. But what else
would you use it for?
 Opening really thick letters?
Killing people?
 Why do you have it?
 It's not mine.
 You're telling me
this is Nick's?
 I'm going to
show you something.
 But you can't tell
anyone.
 I know.
 Nick was always
into weird stuff,
 but I never
expected this.
 These symbols mean
witch hunter.
 Same as the girl had
on her blade.
 Why didn't you
show me these?
 To protect him.
 I know
how this looks.
 He was no traitor.
 No, of course not. There's no
way Nick was a witch hunter.
 But she was, so--
 so, what's
the connection?
 I don't know yet.
 Maybe Nick was looking
into that witch hunter stuff
 and got on their radar.
 You think Nick's the reason
she came here?
 Let me see the knife.
 Well,
isn't this creepy.
 Is this what it takes
to get you excited,
 a little girl
with a knife?
 Cassie, I can't find Melissa,
we should get back.
 I thought you were going
to distract him.
 I tried.
 I didn't realize you were waiting
for him in his room.
 No, I was looking
for something.
 But then, I found
something else.
 Oh!
 Hello?
 Cassie, my name is
Calvin Wilson.
 We met at my shop
earlier today.
 Of course.
 I left something
for you.
 You're in danger.
 In danger?
What do you mean?
 Mr. Wilson?
 Mr. Wilson.
 No costume
on Halloween?
 Hello?
Mr. Wilson?
 Sorry.
No problem.
 I think I got something
on your face. May I?
 Was my warning
not specific enough?
 I wasn't going to tell
her anything about you.
 Remember this?
 I had a feeling
you'd try to be a hero.
 Please. This is just
something personal.
 It doesn't concern you.
 Try me.
 All right.
 She has dark magic
inside her.
 So why are you so desperate
to tell her?
 So she can fight it.
 Maybe stop it from
overcoming her.
 You think people can change
who they are?
 Of course.
 I don't.
 Out. Now.
 Oh, hey, Adam.
 Have you found
Melissa and Diana?
 Because the guy I met at the
antiquities shop called,
 freaked out, and I think he was
trying to warn me
 about w--
 Luke?
 You bleed just like us.
 But you're not.
 That's enough.
Finish the cruet.
 - What's going on?
- Witch hunters.
 This is a ring
of iron sulphide
 to stop your powers.
 Science prevailing over
your ungodly magic.
 We haven't done
anything wrong.
 But you will.
 Luke, please.
Stop this.
 Tell him that
we're not a threat.
 You bound
your circle, Cassie.
 No one to blame
but yourselves.
 So you've been
spying on us all this time,
 just to narc to
other witch hunters?
 Like my father did.
And his father.
 You aren't the only ones
born into a legacy.
 At least I can be
proud of mine.
 Enough.
 Finish it.
 "Watch the witch,
but never trust him,
 "for his every thought
is a sin,
 his every word a lie."
 You have to stop this.
 You shouldn't be here.
 Cassie has dark magic.
 All magic is dark.
 Not like this.
 Cassie isn't like
other witches, Isaac.
 She's stronger.
 We can't kill her
this way.
 You have to trust me.
 You've become
a great asset to me.
 But you are
too close to this.
 I won't stop it.
 Luke, don't.
 Look, Luke,
I'm your friend.
 That's why I wanted to
be the one to do this.
 I'm freeing you
from a life of sin.
 That's not true.
 I'm sorry, Diana.
 You have a good heart,
 but it's not enough
to protect you from
 your true nature.
 This will be fast.
I promise.
 No!
 Oh my God.
 Trust me now?
 Are you ok?
 A guy--a guy in
a pig mask jumped me
 and brought me here.
 I fought him off.
 Where did he go?
 There was an explosion
from inside,
 and he ran off. Another guy
came running out, too.
 What happened
in there?
 It's me. It's ok.
 What are you doing here?
 I had to see you.
I was worried.
 It's ok. I'm ok.
 When he had
your blood...
 I know.
 It's all so real now.
 My whole life,
everyone said,
 "there's that kid who lost
his mom. How sad."
 But you can't lose something
you never had.
 Every day, my dad pulls away
a little more.
 You are my home,
Diana.
 Maybe I'm just supposed
to just let you go now,
 but I can't.
 Because I can't lose
everything I have all at once.
 I want to get past this.
 I know not everything
can be perfect.
 But I have to believe
that it can be,
 just so fighting for it
makes sense.
 And you're not
a believer?
 Not right now.
 You look
a little rattled.
 Oh.
 I just--how can there be
people out there that
 hate us so much, you know?
 It's like,
we haven't done anything.
 We didn't choose this.
We were--we were born this way.
 People don't understand.
 What they don't
understand scares them.
 You seem so calm
about it all.
 I've been at this
longer than you.
 Have you ever done magic
on your own?
 I...
 I think I did something
on my own tonight.
 Really?
 I think I stopped one of those
witch hunters from killing Diana.
 That's
a pretty good trick.
 So, why didn't they round you
up with the rest of us?
 Don't trust me, huh?
 Not really.
 That's ok.
 I don't mind having
to earn it.
 Mmm.
 Good luck with that.
 Henry?
 Henry, it's Jane.
You here?
