 The Secret Circle (2011–2012): Season 1, Episode 3 - Loner - full transcript 
 A cute athlete named Luke asks Cassie to the school dance, and after watching Adam spend time with Diana at the boathouse, she accepts his offer. Meanwhile, Melissa sees the dance as an opportunity to get closer to Nick. Faye, on the other hand, has no plans to go and remains focused on finding a way to control her powers. Dawn discovers someone from their past, an intense man named Zachary Star, is in town asking questions about Cassie and the Circle, so she asks Charles to keep an eye on him.

The Secret Circle...
 My sweet Cassie,
 You finding this means
I'm gone,
 and for that,
I am so sorry.
 I didn't want you
to have this life.
 But destiny's not easy
to run from.
 Hi, I'm Diana.
 You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.
 We're different.
You're different.
 You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded, 100% witch.
 You're here.
We have real power now.
 A complete circle is 6.
 You complete the circle.
 She's got the gift.
 You can get Cassie
to do what we need?
 Circle will take care of that
without even knowing it.
 Has Diana gotten to you about
binding the circle?
 Our energies are flying
everywhere, all at once,
 with no rhyme or reason.
 We need to bind the circle.
 Back off, Faye.
 No. You go away.
Aah!
 Faye, what did you do?
 If we can't control what
we feel or what we think,
 we're just gonna keep
hurting people.
 We have to
bind the circle.
 Lock, unlock.
 Lock, unlock.
 What happened to my magic?
 Could you be any louder?
 I can't open my locker.
 Did you try
the combination?
 Novel idea, Diana.
Why can't I do any spells?
 You can.
 I think that now that
we've bound the circle,
 we can only do
collective magic.
 Oh, you think?
 I never would have bound
the freakin' circle
 if it meant losing my power.
 You didn't lose
your power!
 According to the book, you just
have to have another member
 of the circle present.
 The more you have,
the greater your power.
 This sucks.
 Have you forgotten that
you almost killed Sally?
 Instead of complaining,
you should be thankful
 that things
are under control.
 And you better hope
she doesn't remember.

 Hey, Cassie.
I left you a message.
 Uh, yeah, sorry.
I've been busy.
 Is everything all right?
 I was thinking we could
hang out tonight.
 Maybe we could talk
about what's been going on.
 Thanks, but I can't.
 What's wrong, Cassie?
Did I do something?
 I did your binding ritual
to get our powers under control
 so no one else
would get hurt.
 That doesn't mean we all need
to be friends.
 I know. But we can be.
 Or at least
you and I can.
 I don't like the secrets.
 And I don't like
lying to Sally
 about what really happened.
 This whole thing--
it's--it's too weird!
 I know. Which why I think
we should stick together.
 I'm sorry, Diana.
 It's the way it has to be.
 I like this...
Skipping school.
 Me, too.
 Hey, um...
I have this idea.
 It's gonna sound
kind of crazy.
 But there's this stupid
dance tomorrow.
 And I was thinking
we should go.
 You and me.
 You wanna shower first?
Or do you want me to go?
 That's all you
got to say?
 I just asked you out.
 You said we were just sex,
Melissa.
 You didn't want
anyone to know about us.
 I didn't want people
to think I was slutty.
 Then why do you want to go
to the dance together?
 Because I'm feeling
kind of slutty.
 What if Faye finds out?
 Maybe I'm ok
with it now.
 It's just
a school dance.
 I don't do dances.
 I just thought it would
be nice to do something
 that doesn't
involve sex.
 We're not dating, Melissa.
 If that's where
this is going, we're done.
 You're dick!
 I know your secret.
 What?
 You haven't signed up for any
extracurriculars.
 Oh. Right. I forgot.
 So I was hoping you could
help me with the dance.
 My streamer hanging arm
has seen better days.
 Yes, sure.
Whatever I can do.
 I'm just--
I'm glad you're ok.
 Last night was crazy, huh?
 The doctor said
I was really lucky.
 I never actually
saw what happened.
 Me neither.
It was all a blur.
 But I keep getting
these flashes of Faye.
 Like she did it.
 Faye?! How?
That's impossible.
 I know it sounds crazy.
 But I have this distinct memory
of her giving me her bitch stare
 and then me waking up
on the rocks.
 Wow. She gives me
that stare every day.
 Maybe I should start wearing
a helmet to school.
 I know.
It's ridiculous, right?
 I refuse to let that
girl get inside my head.
 Forget I said anything.
 Hey, Adam.
 Hey.
 So tell me about
this new Cassie girl.
 What about her?
 I've seen you talking
to her.
 Is she friends
with Diana?
 What do you want, Luke?
 An introduction.
 No, I don't think so.
 She's going through a hard time
right now, all right?
 Yeah, I know the story.
 Her mom's died.
Lives with her grandmother.
 She's bummin'. Maybe she
could use someone to talk to.
 Have a good time.
 Sure. Yeah, I guess.
 Yes!
 Things go smoothly?
 Henry's body is
at the lake house.
 It won't be found
until it needs to be.
 Thank you, Charles.
 Henry brought this
on himself, Dawn.
 You had no choice.
 Doesn't make it
any easier.
 He was Faye's
grandfather.
 Well, I searched Henry's house.
 There was no sign
of a crystal.
 I watched the whole thing.
 The circle is bound.
 We have to move fast,
Charles.
 Before someone
else catches on to us.
 There are still people in this
town who remember...
 Hey, honey.
 What are you doing here,
Dad?
 Some budget wrangling.
 You know I handle all
the school's legal work.
 Do you need a ride home?
 No, I'm good.
 Ok. I'll see you
at home.
 He's so cute.
 But taken.
 No, the other cute one.
I know Adam's taken.
 - Hey.
- Hey.
 Glad to see you're
up and around.
 Thanks Adam.
 Uh, Cassie, I want you
to meet a friend of mine.
 This is Luke.
 Hi, Cassie.
Nice to meet you.
 Yeah, you too.
 If you ever need someone
to show you around
 or you just wanna hang out,
 I'm available.
 I'll see you guys,
later.
 Heh.
 Yeah, me too.
I'll see you later.
 You know, there's
a dance tomorrow night?
 Yeah, I'm helping
Sally with it.
 Decorating committee.
 So, you're going.
With anyone?
 Sally.
 Right. Obviously.
 But, you know,
with her sling,
 it's probably gonna be
hard for her to dance.
 So I could fill in
for her.
 If you want.
 Uh, that's my awkward
way of asking you to the dance.
 Well, I appreciate you asking.
 Mm-hmm.
 But I have never decorated
a school dance before,
 much less attended.
 Rain check?
 Yeah, sure.
 There you go.
 The projector is being
set up in the afternoon.
 And most of the lights
are already up.
 We have to go over music
with the DJ.
 We also need 4 circular tables
from the cafeteria
 and then all the stackable chairs
we can get.
 So Luke asked you
to the dance.
 Sort of. I guess.
 But you turned him down.
 Kind of.
 Because you can't stop
staring at Adam?
 What? No. Not at all.
 Adam is dating...Diana.
 And yet for some reason he can't
stop staring at you either.
 Those two have been together
since the Earth cooled.
 Maybe there's trouble
in paradise,
 and it's time to let
those eyes wander.
 I'm not that person.
I know.
 It's just too bad Luke doesn't
have Adam's soulful eyes.
 You are terrible.
 I'll see you tomorrow.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 So what did you
think of Luke?
 He seems nice.
 You guys going to go
to the dance together?
 I don't know. Maybe.
 Hey, Luke.
 Uh, does your offer
still stand?
 Absolutely.
 'Cause I could use a date
to the dance tomorrow night.
 Perfect.
Should I pick you up?
 I'll meet you there.
 That works, too.
 Ok.
 Cassie Blake?
 Yes.
 My name's Zachary.
I just saw you inside.
 It's amazing.
You look just like your mother.
 Oh.
 Thank you.
 You knew her?
 Yeah, we were good friends.
 Is she here?
Is she in town?
 No.
 She passed away.
 Oh, I didn't realize...
 I'm sorry.
 I work on fishing boat.
I don't get into town much.
 What brings you
to Chance Harbor?
 My grandmother
lives here.
 She's my only family.
 So you're staying then?
 You're going to live here?
 Yeah. That's the plan.
 Did you know your mother
vowed she'd never come back?
 I know she had
a difficult time here.
 You're right about that.
Do you know why?
 I should go.
 Do you know why she left?
 Do you know what she was?
 I don't know what
you're talking about.
 Don't lie to me.
 Let go of me!
 You're just like her.
You're a witch.
 Let go! Let go of me!
 Let go of her!
 You shouldn't have come here.
 I'm not going
to let this happen again.
 Oh, it's just you.
 Disappointed?
 Imagine me realizing the only
way to get something to move
 is with my actual hands.
 Where's Nick?
 I'm sure he'll be here.
 What's with
the emergency?
 Cassie was attacked.
 Who attacked you?
 I don't know. Zachary.
 He works on a fishing boat.
 Said he was
friends with my mom.
 I know who he is...
Sort of.
 He--he comes into the boathouse
every once in a while.
 He always just
stays to himself.
 He knew my mom
was a witch.
 And he tried to get me
to admit that I was, too.
 But then Diana showed up
and we magically pushed him away.
 Magic? It worked?
 Like I told you it would...
with more than one of us.
 But the point is
Cassie was attacked
 and this guy
knows about us.
 It's not just him.
 Sally was asking questions
about Faye and the accident.
 - She was?
- That's not good.
 As long as we stay
together, we'll be ok.
 We proved that today.
 Our power isn't random
and out of control anymore.
 It was like Cassie and I
shared the same thought.
 And it played out
exactly the way we wanted.
 Where are you going?
 I'm not sharing
my thoughts with anyone,
 especially Diana, who keeps
all the rules to herself.
 I need to find a spell that can
turn me back into a solo act.
 You should've told us we were
going to lose our individual powers.
 I didn't know.
 We haven't quite worked out
the kinks of getting along.
 I can see that.
 It'll be fine.
 We'll practice and learn
to work together better.
 It'll be fine, I promise.
 Look, I appreciate you
having my back.
 But you all need to figure
this out for yourselves.
 Cassie, the circle is nothing
if we're not together.
 We have to be.
 Unless you think you
could've handled that
 guy by yourself today.
 Diana?
 Diana, are you up?
 Diana?
 What's going on?
 Well, I was just at the
boathouse for coffee,
 and I heard about
the incident yesterday.
 Are you all right?
What happened?
 It was nothing.
 Just some weird
guy bugging Cassie.
 Zachary Larson.
What was he saying to her?
 I don't know.
 I just helped get
rid of him. Why? Who is he?
 He's just someone I went to
school with a long time ago.
 He's always been unbalanced,
 it would be best
if you stay away from him.
 I don't need convincing.
I will gladly stay away from him.
 Good.
 Dad, what's going on with you
and Mrs. Chamberlain?
 I told you.
I'm working with the school.
 You're a terrible liar.
 What would you say
if I told you that Dawn and
 I were seeing each other?
 Really?
 Would that bother you?
 No, not at all.
 I'm glad you're dating.
And she's great.
 We've just been spending
a little time together, that's all.
 Nothing serious.
 But you never know, right?
 I just want you to be happy.
 You--you've been alone
for too long.
 Thank you.
 It's just baby steps,
all right?
 Your mother is a hard
act to follow.
 My father said
he knew him in school
 and he was really bad news.
 He doesn't look
like that here.
 What exactly
did he say to you?
 Just that he knew my mother.
 And that
"It can't happen gain."
 Do you think
he meant the fire?
 I guess.
 What really happened
that night?
 And no one else knows
what really happened.
 It looks like
Zachary Larson does.
 Then we need to find out.
 I'm glad you called.
 Let's concentrate on it
at the exact same time.
 Are you concentrating?
 Trying. It's harder when I'm
answering your questions.
 When I count to 3,
focus all your energy
 on moving it toward me.
 What are you doing?
 Trying to figure out this
bound magic nightmare.
 Ready?
 1, 2...3.
 We did it.
 Last week I was setting
things on fire
 without having to hold
someone's hand to do it.
 But who knows
what else we can do.
 According to Diana the more of us
doing the spell, the stronger it is.
 I wonder what we could do
with 3 of us.
 I've got an idea about what
we can do with 3 of us.
 Dream on, Nick.
 My mom's chaperoning
the dance tonight.
 So come over around 8:00
and we'll look for some...
 Actually, I was thinking I might
check out the dance later.
 At the school?
The school dance?
 Seriously?
 Yeah.
Why?
 Because I want to go.
 Just 'cause we're witches doesn't
mean we can't go to dances.
 No, we don't go to dances
because we're not lame.
 I like dancing
unlike some people.
 We're in high school!
You know, that's what kids do.
 And I want to do it, too.
 Go ahead. Have fun.
 You should come with.
 It'll be better than just
sitting here by yourself.
 That's ok.
 I don't mind being alone.
 Unlike you, Melissa,
I like myself.
 What's going on?
 Zachary Larson approached
Cassie yesterday.
 There's a name from the past.
What did he want?
 I don't know. But I don't think he
knows anything that could hurt us.
 He wasn't there that night.
 He was friends with Amelia.
 She wouldn't have told him
anything.
 We have no idea
what she told him.
 It's been 16 years.
Why would he start talking now?
 Because Amelia's daughter
is here.
 Just talk to him.
 I intend to.
 Give me the crystal.
 Just talk, ok?
 We can't kill everybody
who gets in our way.
 Suddenly
you have scruples?
 Dead bodies tend
to raise questions.
 It's not smart.
 Fine.
 Oh, by the way,
 I told Diana that
we're dating.
 - You did what?!
- I had no choice.
 She knew I was lying to her
about seeing you at school.
 But she believed this?
 Yes, she did.
 Is that so hard
to imagine?
 Just...Talk to Zachary.
 "Air around me,
 grant me fire."
 "Air around me,
 grant me fire."
 Who are you?
 Stay away from me.
I'm calling the police.
 And tell them what?
 That the 6 of you are witches?
 How do you know that?
 I know your families.
 I know you,
and I know your friends.
 I just have one question.
 Have you bound
your circle?
 Don't come any closer.
I'm serious.
 Then stop me.
 Alone you have no power.
 You've already
bound your circle.
 You look amazing.
 So do you.
 Thanks.
 I'm...a little nervous.
 I didn't have a huge
social life at my old school.
 Or a small one
or any one at all actually.
 Are you saying
you're a loner?
 I've been called worse.
 Come on. Let's go
change all that.
 You showed up.
 What do you want from me,
Melissa?
 Nothing.
 I'm not dancing.
 That's ok.
I'm just glad you're here.
 Hey, future stepmother alert.
 Not funny!
 I should talk to her.
 She probably knows my dad
told me they're dating,
 and I don't want it
to be weird.
 You are way
too mature for me.
 Hi, Mrs. Chamberlain.
 Diana, how are you?
Having fun?
 I am. Yes. Thank you.
 I just wanted to say
 my dad told me you're
seeing each other.
 And I think it's great.
 And he seems
really happy about it.
 Well, your dad
is a special man.
 Yeah. He is.
 Have fun.
 Should I go get us
something to drink?
 Sure.
 Hey.
 You look nice.
 No compliments.
 Sorry.
 Guys, please dance.
No one is dancing.
 This can't be
one of those lame parties
 where no one dances.
 I don't know where Luke is.
 If you two go out there,
 I'm sure other
people will, too. Please?
 Hmm. I pretty sure
she did that on purpose.
 Why? She think you wanted
to dance with me?
 No. I don't know.
Can we not talk about this?
 Hey, you almost done?
 What's the rush?
 I like the song they're
playing in the gym.
 And I thought maybe
 I could change your mind
about dancing.
 Forget it.
 Oh, come on, Nick!
 You came all
the way here.
 Why not have
some fun together?
 Why do you like me?
 What kind of question
is that?
 I treat you like crap, and you
just keep coming back for more.
 I mean, do you just like
being dumped on or something?
 No, actually. I don't.
 - Melissa!
- What're you doing here?
 I was at the abandoned house,
 and some psycho broke in
and almost attacked me.
 I think it was the same guy
that attacked Cassie.
 He knew about us.
 I know you're trying to keep
your distance from me.
 And I understand.
 I think.
 I'm really glad that you reached
out to Diana today, though.
 She really wants
to be your friend.
 And that's nice of her but I'm
not so sure it's a great idea.
 Why?
 Why? Really?
 Because sometimes when we're
together, street lights explode.
 And I think that might be
weird for Diana.
 And you. And me.
 It's different now that
the circle is bound.
 Is it?
 I don't know, Cassie.
 But we have to make
this work somehow.
 For all of us.
 Adam!
 Someone broke into the abandoned
house when Faye was there.
 Sounds like it was
Zachary Larson.
 I had no power
to defend myself.
 I could've been killed,
all because you took away my magic.
 Don't blame Diana--
 It doesn't matter.
 What's important is we're
all in danger right now.
 Why is he coming after us?
 He knows about the circle
and he knows we bound it.
 He knew something about the fire
that killed our parents.
 How?
 Ok. I look him up online
 and couldn't find anything
else about him
 or how he's connected
to our families.
 Did you check school records?
 We don't have access
to those.
 You do if you have
your mom's master key.
 So this is where
the party is.
 I was, uh--
 I was just roping some people
into helping Sally with
 dance committee stuff.
 Cassie,
why don't you head back in?
 I will handle
the whole clean-up problem.
 You sure?
 Absolutely.
 Hello, Zachary.
 It's been a long time.
 Charles.
 I figured you'd be by.
 You've been bothering
my daughter.
 Why would you do
something like that?
 Your daughter's a witch.
 So are her friends.
 Witchcraft?
 Are we back
to those rumors?
 What are we?
Teenagers all over again?
 Charles,
I know what you are.
 Amelia and I were close,
she told me everything.
 The way I remember it,
Amelia hated you.
 The deeper she got in
with all of you
 the further she pushed me
and Heather away.
 Heather.
 What a shame.
 She never stopped
believing in Amelia.
 And look what happened.
 Now that Cassie Blake
is back,
 it's happening
all over again.
 You're paranoid.
 There's nothing
going on.
 You know they're practicing.
 And you're not stopping them.
What are you up to?
 That is the kind of accusation
that could get you in trouble.
 I hoped this day
would never come.
 I have no other choice.
 All I have to do
is kill one of them.
 Let me know if
you hear anyone coming.
 Oh, I'll be long gone.
 What's her mom's password?
 She said to try 02-25-95.
It's Faye's birthday.
 Really?
 Ah. All right.
 Ok. Average student.
 A few clubs,
track and field.
 Ok. Then it looks like he
started getting into trouble.
 He suspended for fighting.
 He was suspended
for skipping school with his
 girlfriend, Heather Barnes.
 Wait, Heather Barnes?
 I saw that name
in Cassie's yearbook.
 She's friends
with Amelia too.
 Like being at a dance
isn't boring enough...
 Did you come here for Nick?
 No.
 Hey. Did something happen?
 He hates me.
And I don't know why.
 Nick doesn't hate you.
 Nick hates Nick.
 He lost hs parents.
He has issues.
 We all did.
 We lost one. He lost both.
 He's double damaged.
 Heather Barnes was on
student council with Amelia.
 And yearbook and volleyball
 and a million
other things.
 Let me check something.
 That's the fire
that killed our parents.
 Why Heather Barnes?
 Was she with them?
Did she die, too?
 "Among the victims
was Heather Barnes."
 That's it.
That's all it says.
 What the hell?
 He's blaming what happened
to Heather on our parents?
 Yeah.
 But he's taking
it out on us.
 Well, everyone seems to
be having a good time.
 Sally will be relieved.
 Do you want to dance?
 I'm bad at it, just fyi.
 I'm good here, for now.
Maybe later?
 No, I don't think so.
 What's wrong?
 I think I'm gonna head out.
 But it's early.
 Look, I was cool about you
 jumping on the dance floor
with Adam--
 Sally made us do that.
 And about you ditching me
 to disappear into the hall
with your pals.
 But even when you're with me,
you're watching the door.
 Your mind's somewhere else.
 Luke, I'm sorry.
I really am.
 I'm actually
a pretty good date.
 It's too bad
you didn't give me a chance.
 Where the hell have you been?!
 - Around.
- Selling stuff?
 That guy who came after me
at the abandoned house?
 He's after all of us.
 Why?
 His girlfriend died
in the fire 16 years ago.
 He blames our parents.
 Mine are dead,
so he's outta luck.
 He's coming for us,
not them.
 And if you're going to date
Melissa, treat her right.
 We're not dating.
We just hang out.
 You're using her.
 And she's using me.
Works great.
 She's not using you.
She likes you.
 And she deserves better.
So, do it right or get lost.
 Who's there? Nick?
 Not funny.
 Dawn.
 What the hell happened to you?!
 Zachary attacked me.
He knows about the bound circle.
 He's coming
for the kids.
 Oh, my God.
 He'll do
whatever it takes.
 We can't let him
hurt them.
 Go outside. Watch the exits.
 He won't come
through the front.
 What if he's
already inside?
 Then we better hurry.
 Hey, have you seen Cassie?
 No.
 Sally said she left Luke,
looking for us 20 minutes ago.
 We got to find her.
 Aah!
 Back to the gym, now!
 Aah!
 She's over there.
 What do we do?
 We're all here.
We're at full power, right?
 What can we do?
 Help!
 Let her go!
 I'm sorry Heather died.
 But Cassie
didn't kill her.
 Heather didn't die.
 What Amelia did to her
was far worse.
 Ok. Now what?
 Oh my God, is he dead?!
 No, he's breathing.
 Well, get away from him,
just in case.
 What are we going to do?
 We get the hell
out of here.
 We can't leave him.
The school is full of people.
 So what? We're the only
ones he wants to kill.
 We should call the police.
 And tell them what?
 What's going on?
 What happened?
 Mom, I can explain.
 He was chasing after us--
 because we saw him
breaking open lockers.
 Yeah, and then we threatened
to call the police,
 and he started
chasing after us.
 He slipped
on the papers and fell.
 He hit his head hard.
 He did all this by himself?
 We don't know.
We came in here and the hallway
 was already
such a disaster zone.
 I know this man.
He's an addict.
 He's been breaking in and
vandalizing this place for years.
 I don't want you guys
involved in this.
 Just go back
to the dance. Ok?
 I'm going to take care
of this from here.
 Charles...
 I've got him.
 What did your mother say?
 All she knows is that
Zachary's a crazy local
 who broke into the school.
 Are they going
to arrest him?
 And my mom said security took
him to the police station.
 Lucky for us, she asked
that they keep it quiet
 so it doesn't reflect badly
on the school.
 You guys saved my life.
 Don't get all
weepy about it.
 No, really. Thank you.
 All of you.
 See you losers tomorrow.
 I got to find out
what Zachary meant.
 What my mom
did to Heather Barnes--
 We will.
Just not tonight, please.
 I think we all just need
to get home right now.
 Come on. I'll give you bums
a ride home.
 It's ok. I'll make sure
Cassie gets home.
 Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.
 I just--I will sleep better knowing
that you got home safely.
 Hey, you wanna ride?
 I thought
I might walk awhile.
 I didn't mean to your house.
I meant to mine.
 I don't want that
anymore, Nick. Sorry.
 Maybe we could
just hang out.
 Watch a movie.
 I feel like I never knew
who my mom really was.
 I don't remember
my mother at all.
 I guess it must be harder
having known her.
 Well, thanks
for hanging with me.
 I know you didn't ask to be
a part of the circle.
 You've got
your whole loner thing.
 And I get it.
 And it's not like
Faye and I are BFFs.
 I mean,
she hates me most of the time.
 I just think we're better
together than we are apart.
 Power or no power.
 Sorry if I was rude to you.
 It's ok. I get it.
 I see the way he looks at you.
 No, it's nothing.
 I hope you're right.
 Because I love him.
 I've loved him
for as long as I can remember.
 You have nothing
to be worried about, Diana.
 I would never come
between you two.
 I really do like you,
Cassie.
 I want us to be friends.
 I'd like that.
 You've been marked.
 No matter where you go
or where you hide, I'll find you.
 And if you ever even look
at one of our children again,
 I will literally turn your life
into a living hell
 much worse
than Heather ever knew.
