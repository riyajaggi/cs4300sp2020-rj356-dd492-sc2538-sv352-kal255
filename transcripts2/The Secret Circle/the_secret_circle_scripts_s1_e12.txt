"The Secret Circle"...
 My sweet Cassie, you
finding this means I'm gone,
 and for that, I am so sorry.
 I didn't want you
to have this life,
 but destiny's not
easy to run from.
 You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded 100% witch.
 A complete circle is six.
 You complete the circle.
 That's the fire that
killed our parents.
 We need to know what
happened 16 years ago.
 That's when my mom died.
 And my dad.
 Francis Balcoin was as evil
as they come.
 He passed his dark power from
my father to me.
 We can all figure
this out together.
 Don't!
 Whatever this is,
I don't want it inside me.
 That fire
that he died in,
 did he have anything
to do with that?
 This is not a road
you want to go down.
 What if I'm just like him.
 Jake said understanding
where it comes from
 is what can help you
control it.
 Jake was a witch hunter
who chose to leave with them.
 You're now open
to receiving Cassie's energy.
 Faster, people.
It didn't work.
 I got your magic,
didn't I?
 The circle's magic,
not Cassie's.
 Interrupting something?
 What the hell are
you doing here?
 Keeping an eye on Cassie.
 You were at the school.
 You're the one who saved me
and Melissa from the fire.
 So you're an
avenging angel now.
 Don't they usually
stay hidden in the shadows?
 Don't you usually have
a different girlfriend?
 What happened?
 Why did you leave
with the witch hunters?
 Where have you been?
 I had to get them as far away
from you as possible
 before I could escape.
 Part two of your plan is just
to lead them right to her?
 I came back to warn you.
About what?
 Discovering you were
a Balcoin stopped
 Isaac from killing you.
 Your bloodline's too strong
for him to mess with.
 He didn't want to
get torched like Luke.
 So then I'm safe.
 From Isaac.
 But not from the council.
 There's a council
of witch hunters?
 You their mascot?
 They have a ritual
that they use
 to kill witches
with dark power.
 The last time they used it
was 16 years ago.
 To kill your father.
 It's how they plan
on killing you.

 I thought my father was killed
in the fire with everyone else.
 And that happened because
the circle wasn't bound
 and their magic
got out of control.
 That's what we pieced
together from Diana's book.
 I thought
the same thing.
 I had no idea that
the witch hunters
 were at the boat yard that day,
but they were.
 So witch hunters
killed my father?
 Yes.
 Did they kill
all our parents?
 I only know
about Blackwell.
 One of the men in the council,
Eben, was there that day.
 He was talking about the ritual
they used to kill your father
 and destroy his dark magic.
 What was the ritual?
 He wouldn't tell me.
 Isaac didn't even know.
 But finding out is
the only way to protect you.
 You buying this?
 Adam, he saved
my life before.
 Or he just didn't know how
to kill you last time
 without the proper
ritual,
 and now he's come
back to find out.
 That's ridiculous.
 You stay away
from Cassie.
 You know
where to find me.
 You ok?
 Heh. I have no idea.
 You want to talk
about it?
 Which it? Jake?
The witch hunters?
 My father?
 I don't know.
Ladies choice.
 If Jake's right,
 then I have to find out
what happened to my father.
 I mean, I really have to.
 How do you trust him?
 I don't...I can't explain it.
I just do.
 I don't get why he's so obsessed
with your dark magic.
 He's just trying to
help me understand it.
 Why?
 Because he cares about me.
 You or your powers?
 He uses people.
That's all I'm saying.
 That's who he is.
 You don't really know him.
 But you do.
 Hey. I texted you both
like a hundred times.
 Is everything ok?
I was worried.
 Not worried
you were together,
 worried you were ok.
 We're fine.
I mean, sort of.
 I'll fill you in.
 Sweetheart, what are
you doing here?
 Dawn asked me to coffee.
 To catch up on a little
girl talk and gossip.
 I've got to run, so why don't you
take my seat?
 No, I can't. I'm...
 Dad, sit. Relax.
 Thanks again
for coffee.
 This was awesome.
 We'll do it again.
 Don't ever use my
daughter to get to me.
 What do you expect me
to do, Charles?
 You don't answer
my phone calls.
 Well, I thought I made it clear
I don't want to talk to you.
 Why, because your mother
doesn't like me?
 Maybe because
you wanted to kill her.
 Look, I admit,
things got a little crazy.
 But we have two crystals.
 The circle is bound.
 We are on our way
to getting our power back.
 No, Dawn, you have a dead one
and I have an alive one,
 and you're never getting
anywhere near it.
 Why are you doing
this to me, Charles?
 You're up to something
 and I'm gonna
find out what.
 After what happened
last night,
 you trying to siphon
magic from the circle,
 I don't know
why I'm here.
 Because your circle
skanks don't want you back.
 Because there are other ways
to get your magic back.
 So you keep saying.
 Hey, Lee.
 I didn't know you were
with a client.
 Please.
I'm not a client.
 A friend?
 Introduce me.
 Faye,
this is Callum.
 What do you want?
 Faye. Beautiful name.
 I'm surprised he even
remembers mine.
 Bitch won't return
my calls.
 I've been busy.
 Oh, yeah,
I can see that.
 Excuse us, honey.
Shop talk.
 Get us some beers
from the house.
 Do I look like
a waitress?
 Get it yourself.
 Got yourself a lively one
here, Lee, huh?
 Can't wait to get
to know you better.
 Did you get Adam's
permission to come here?
 Did you come back
to kill me?
 You wouldn't be here all by
yourself if you really thought that.
 Actually, while you've
been gone,
 I've been really getting
a hang of this dark magic thing.
 So, yeah, I would.
 If I wanted to kill you,
 I would have left you
in the burning school.
 I'm here to save
your life.
 By figuring out how
they killed my father?
 - Yes.
- How?
 You can't ask
anyone's parents
 and you can't ask
the witch hunters.
 So who's left to tell us
what happened that day?
 Me.
 What does that mean?
 I was there.
 At the fire?
 How? You would have been
so young.
 I was hiding in
my parents' car.
 They didn't know
I was there.
 Why didn't you say
anything before?
 I don't remember much.
 I must have
blocked it all out.
 So...What?
 I think you can
help me remember.
 Or maybe even see
what happened for yourself.
 How?
 You can connect
with others
 in ways the rest
of us can't.
 You want me to go
into your memory?
 On the day of the fire,
my parents were going out.
 I didn't want them
to go without me,
 so I snuck into
the backseat
 and hid under a blanket.
 When we got to
the boat yard, they parked,
 went onto the ferry.
 I waited until they couldn't
see me and followed them.
 I snuck up onto the boat,
 and that's the last thing
I can remember.
 Diana said
you were here.
 She didn't mention you brought
along your pet psychopath.
 Adam, he was at the fire
16 years ago.
 Whatever he saw
was bad enough
 that he's blocked it out
completely.
 So?
 For years I've been working
on a memory spell
 that can take me
back to that day
 so we can find out
what really happened.
 So what makes you think
the spell will work now?
 Cassie and her dark magic.
 See, there's a disconnect
 between Jake's memories
and the consciousness of it.
 So if I can link to him
and experience his memory,
 maybe I can see
what he's blocked out.
 You hear how ridiculous
that sounds?
 I did it with Faye
at her grandfather's cabin.
 I saw Faye's memory
of herself as a little girl.
 It was like she was standing
right in front of us.
 Is this spell safe?
 The only risk is if
the mind disconnects
 from what's real.
 By us experiencing it
together, we'll be
 grounded to each other.
 I barely understand
what that means.
 Cassie, please, it's
too much of a risk.
 I can't. I can't
just wait around
 for these witch hunters
to come at me
 with some super special
dark magic killing plan.
 I have to find out
what happened that day.
 We all do.
 This is our only chance.
 Chill out,
you'll get it.
 Yeah, well, while you're whining,
the price is going up.
 So how do you know this guy?
 I used to work with him.
 Later.
 You make it sound
like ancient history.
 What's it been,
less than a year?
 How's Eva?
 Who's Eva?
 Old girlfriend.
 We lost touch.
 Sorry to hear that.
 So, are you gonna get me
what I need or what?
 You know I don't
deal anymore.
 You're a drug dealer?
 Was.
 Not just any drug.
 Purundenga.
The devil's spirit.
 What does it do?
 Gives you super powers.
 What does that mean?
 You want to find out?
 No, she doesn't.
 And like I said,
I don't have any.
 I think...
 You still know
where to get it.
 You got two hours.
 Faye, why don't you
take off?
 No, no, no, no.
You go, she stays.
 Why don't we leave
her out of this?
 Lee thinks I might
hurt you.
 But why would I?
I don't have a reason to.
 Do I, Lee?
 Go ahead, Lee.
I'll stay.
 No way.
 It's ok.
I'm sure Callum here
 will be the perfect
gentleman.
 You sure?
 All right.
Be right back.
 Hey.
 Your text said
it was important.
 Cassie's gonna do this
crazy memory spell
 with Jake tonight.
 What does that mean?
 Jake was there
the day of the fire
 that killed our parents.
 They want to spell his memory
and have Cassie access it
 like she did with Faye.
 So they might be
able to see our parents,
 find out what really
happened that day.
 Yeah, that's the idea,
but it's too risky.
 And Jake has her convinced
that it's fine.
 She's a big girl, and I don't
blame her for wanting to.
 I'd do it, too,
if I could.
 Just to see them,
to know the truth.
 Everybody in the circle
had their lives destroyed that day.
 We should all be there.
 This is
where it happened?
 Yeah.
 Which one is it?
 Are you sure you wanna
try this?
 Yeah.
 I have to know.
 Me, too.
 Ok, so what do you remember
after getting out of the car?
 I could hear people
on the boat.
 I could hear sounds
all around me, up on deck,
 behind closed doors.
 But I couldn't find
my parents anywhere.
 That's all.
 I remember coming
down here,
 but everything
after this is really foggy.
 Whatever I saw,
whatever happened,
 it was down here.
 For the spell we need something
from the boat
 that would have been
here 16 years ago.
 Hey, Dawn.
What can I get you?
 A drink.
 Is everything all right?
 Not really.
 Can I help?
 You're sweet.
 You always were.
 I remember when you and
Amelia started dating.
 I envied how you were
always there for her.
 She was
a lucky girl.
 I don't think she
saw it that way.
 Things got confusing
for all of us.
 So, what's going on?
 It's nothing.
 Dawn.
 It's Charles.
 What happened?
 We got in
an argument and...
 Things got heated.
 Did he do something
to you?
 He choked me.
 What is it?
 He did the same thing to me.
 Dawn, you've got to
press charges.
 - I can't.
- Why the hell not?
 He did magic.
 Ethan, he has a crystal.
I saw it.
 Then I'll take care
of him.
 He's dangerous.
 You know Charles and I
have never gotten along.
 He was a bully back then,
and he still is.
 But I will not let him
get away with it anymore.
 Thank you.
 When you get
the crystal,
 we'll figure out the safest way
to get rid of it.
 Is this you, Nick,
and your parents?
 It's the only picture I have
of my mother and father.
 So, what do we do now?
 Read the spell
out loud.
 Ok.
 Touch the dirt and ashes from
the boat.
 Visualize the night
of the fire.
 Corpore intin,
comsera en praterum.
 What's happening?
 It worked.
 No luck?
 Melissa went to Seattle
with her dad
 and Faye's phone is off.
 I left her a message to meet
us at the abandoned house.
 So it's just us?
 I feel like the circle
is falling apart.
 Maybe finding out
the truth about that day
 will bring us
back together.
 Ethan.
What do you want?
 I know you have a crystal
 and that you killed
Henry Chamberlain
 when he found out.
 Are you drunk?
You should sleep it off.
 I'm sober as
a church mouse, Charles.
 I'm telling the elders.
 They'll stop you.
 You can't kill them all.
 What do we do now?
 Come on,
we're gonna be late.
 What if someone sees us?
 We're gonna be fine.
 Hey!
 I guess they can't.
 This is so strange.
 Is that?
 My parents.
 Come on, let's
follow them.
 Aah!
 What's wrong?
 I don't know.
My head.
 Are you ok?
 Yeah.
 All right, come on.
 Sarah, listen to me.
 The witch hunters don't
want to kill
 if they don't have to.
 They promised me.
 I can't hear what
they're saying.
 We need to get
closer.
 It's getting worse.
 My memory, everything's
getting confusing.
 If we agree to stop
practicing,
 they'll agree
to leave us alone.
 It's true.
It's the right thing to do.
 Yeah, but John says
we shouldn't trust them.
 And you believe
his instincts over mine?
 What is it about Blackwell?
 They're talking
about my father.
 We...We have to
follow them.
 I...I can't.
 Something terrible
is about to happen.
 What?
 We have to get
out of here.
 I have to find
my father.
 No, no.
 Everything past here
is completely blocked.
 We can't go any further.
 I have to.
 You can't.
 It's too dangerous
otherwise.
 We have to stay together.
 I need to see
what happened.
 Cassie.
 Cassie!
 Cassie?
 Cassie, come back.
 Cassie!
 Please come back.
 Cassie, come back.
 Just talk to John,
ok?
 Hear what
he has to say.
 They're waiting for us
to agree to the truce.
 I'm not going to go back
to town to find Blackwell...
 John's here.
 He's on the deck
upstairs.
 It's too late.
 Tom's already inside.
 So is Sophie Ann.
 But Dawn's up on deck
with Charles.
 They agree with John.
 There's no truce without
the whole circle.
 Someone has to take
the first step.
 If we show our support,
maybe the others will follow.
 Amelia's not even here.
 She won't go near John with
the way he betrayed her.
 I'm worried that the
circle is falling apart.
 Maybe we should let it.
 We've already taken things
farther than we should have.
 If we agree
to stop practicing,
 we'll be safe again.
 Ok.
 You're right.
 Let's end this
 and go home
to our children.
 Ethan.
 What are you doing here?
 See, I told you Eben
would show.
 My wife there thought
you...
 No!
 No! No!
 No!
 You husband should have
listened to you.
 Oh, my God, Lucy.
 Mommy.
 Jake.
 Cassie, come back to me.
Come back!
 Come back, Cassie,
please.
 Get your hands off her.
 What happened?
 We went to my memory.
We saw my parents.
 She followed them.
 And then what?
Where is she now?
 We need to stop this.
Do a spell to bring her back.
 That won't make
things worse?
 Can you believe
the junk he has?
 Not a fan of masks?
 Not since Halloween.
 Well, we all wear masks,
every day.
 Tell me more about this Devil's Spirit.
 Just a non-addictive
herbal enhancement.
 But it has
special properties.
 It'll open up your mind,
 free you
from inhibition.
 For someone like you who I can
see isn't afraid of anything,
 it would tap into
your inner strength
 and give you the power to have
or do anything you want.
 The hell?
 Keep your panties on.
We were just talking.
 Is that it?
 Leave. Go.
 Want to try some, Faye?
It's a rush.
 I said leave.
 Damn it, Faye!
 I just cleaned up
the place
 from the last time
you trashed it.
 You're acting like
idiots.
 No, no, it's ok.
Lee here was just trying
 to protect you
from crazy Callum.
 Kind of touching,
actually.
 Get out.
 See you around.
 John Blackwell.
 You've been accused
and found guilty.
 Have you anything
to say?
 Admit your guilt.
Confess your sins.
 Die with peace.
 You know you can't kill me.
 Couldn't kill you.
 Not without a
dark root colocasia.
 Get that away from me.
 Tenebras dissipare.
Omne evum.
 Go to hell.
 No, John, hell is
where you're going.
 No!
 What are you doing here?
 You don't belong here.
 You...you can see me?
 Get out. Now.
 Come with me.
 What's happening?
 She's suffocating.
 She's choking
on the smoke.
 Her brain's telling her
 she's really in the fire.
 All right, we have
no choice now,
 we have to do
something.
 Put your hands
on her.
 Concentrate on
expanding her lungs.
 Breathe. Breathe, Cassie.
 Breathe. Breathe.
 Breathe.
 Breathe. Breathe.
 You've got to go back
and get her out.
 I don't think I can.
 I don't give a damn
about your blocked memories.
 You took her there,
now get her the hell out.
 Read this spell.
 Corpore intin,
comsera en praterum.
 Corpore...
 Aah!
 Ignidissipare et vallum.
 Aah!
 Cassie!
 Are you ok?
 Help! Can anybody here me?
 No, no, no! Mom!
 Is anyone there?
 Cassie, hey.
 Trust me, I could kick
Callum's ass all over
 Chance Harbor if I wanted.
 Mm-hmm.
 But I'd like to keep him
in my past.
 And what about
this Eva?
 Is she really
in your past
 or is she about
to walk through the door?
 I stopped dealing
devil's spirit for a reason.
 I kept telling her
to stay away from it,
 but she wouldn't listen.
 She took too much?
 It destroyed her.
 I'm sorry.
 It was awful.
 The truce was a trap.
 And I think the circle, they were
split over who to believe.
 Those who trusted the witch hunters
were lead into the cafeteria
 of the boat
and massacred.
 You saw your father?
 I didn't see his face.
 But he was standing
right in front of me.
 He got out.
He didn't die in that room
 like the witch hunters
thought.
 All these years,
I believed Isaac
 when he said the witches
 were the ones who started
the fire that night.
 No.
 It was definitely
the witch hunters.
 I saw them.
 They started the fire when
they tried to kill my father.
 Your mother
was so brave.
 Your father, too.
 All he wanted was
for them to be safe.
 What about the rest
of them?
 Did you see my mother?
 Was my mom in
the cafeteria?
 I don't know.
 I could hear things going on
in other parts of the boat,
 but I'm
not sure what.
 I'm sorry.
 But I saw your dad.
 He was coming out
of the room.
 That's impossible.
 My dad wasn't there
that day.
 You must have seen
someone else.
 No, I saw his face
and heard his name.
 Why would he lie?
 Let's get out of here.
 I'll catch up with
you guys later.
 Are you sure?
 I was right.
 You did kill
Henry Chamberlain.
 Otherwise, why come
after me with this?
 I didn't kill
anybody.
 You're a bully, Charles.
You always were.
 First me, then Dawn.
 Dawn?
 She put you
up to this?
 She's playing you,
Ethan.
 It's what she does.
 You're a fool.
 As soon as she gets
the crystal back,
 you're dead, just like Henry.
She killed him.
 You expect me
to believe that?
 Power is very
intoxicating.
 You should know that
as well as anyone.
 Shut up.
 Look, you don't want
to repeat history.
 It's not too late.
Just walk away.
 I said shut up.
 Ethan.
 That's enough.
That's enough.
 Get out.
 Sorry if I scared you.
 The horror that you
saw that day,
 maybe it should have
stayed locked away.
 No.
 I wasn't just
blocking out a memory.
 I was blocking out
the truth.
 That's why it was so easy for
Isaac to manipulate me.
 I believed our parents
were destroyed
 by the destructive thirst
for power,
 not that they were murdered.
 I found this.
 My father was wearing it the day
of the fire.
 It saved him.
 So you're safe
from them now.
 Glad I came back.
 Is that the only
reason that you did?
 No.
 Maybe I was too late.
 Everything's just really
complicated right now.
 I can't stop thinking
about my father.
 If he really did
get off this ferry,
 then is there a chance
that he's still alive?
 Why would he let people
 believe he's been dead
for all these years?
 I don't know.
 He's buried at
Harbor cemetery,
 not too far from my parents.
 Do you still think
Jake came back to hurt us?
 I don't know what
I believe anymore.
 You do realize he's
in love with Cassie.
 Yeah.
 I don't know
how to do this.
 Do what?
 Us.
 Being friends.
 Me neither.
 But we have to.
 Anyway, nobody else
knows me like you do.
 Ethan, what happened?
 Did Charles hurt you?
 No. I got the crystal.
 Oh, thank God.
 Where is it?
 It's safe.
 Can I see it?
 Tomorrow. Ok?
 Ethan.
For tonight...
 I think I'll just
hold onto it.
 Good.
 Hold onto it.
 I'll see you
tomorrow.
 Stay where you are
or I'll scream.
 Ohh. Just brought you
a little present.
 Devil's spirit.
 No, thanks.
 No problem.
 It's just you expressed
some interest
 and I'm very sensitive
to a pretty girl's needs.
 Call me if you develop
any more needs.
 Don't hold
your breath.
 Just want you
to know I realize
 this is kind of insane.
 Yeah.
 I just need to know
if my father's alive.
 Wait.
 Go ahead.
