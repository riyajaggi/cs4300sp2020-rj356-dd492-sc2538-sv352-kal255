 My sweet Cassie,
 I didn't want you
to have this life.
 But destiny's not easy
to run from.
 Hey, come on! Really?
 Hey! Hey!
 Hey, can I get a...
 Hello?
 I got a flat.
 Where are you?
 Close. I'm on Oak.
 Are you ok?
Did you call AAA?
 I know how to change
a tire, Mom.
 - I'm coming.
- Oh, good idea.
 Take your car.
 Oh, wait...
it has a flat.
 Then I will walk
or catch a cab.
 Like you know how to change
a tire. I got it.
 Well, then, I'll stand there and
watch you do it, smarty-pants.
 Seriously, I got it.
 - Cassie?
- Mom?
 Hello?
 Oh!
 Ugh.
 Jeez.
 Aah!
 Oh!
 Cassie.
 Oh!
 Aah!

 Cassie!
 Hi.
 Ohh.
 Hey, Grandma.
 I should never have let you
drive by yourself.
 Well, it's not like
I gave you a choice.
 How are you?
 I'm good.
 I am really glad
you're here.
 Come on.
 So this is where
my mom grew up.
 Come on.
I'll show you your room.
 We can move
everything out.
 Should have by now.
It's only been 16 years.
 There so much about her
I didn't know.
 How come
she never came home?
 What did she tell you?
 Not much,
just the headlines.
 You'd just been born when
your dad had his accident.
 It was hard
for her here.
 I think she wanted
to start over.
 Yeah. That's pretty much
what she said.
 I'll let you
get settled.
 Dinner will be
ready soon.
 Your mom used
to hum that.
 All the time.
I stole it from her.
 You ready for
school tomorrow?
 Is anyone ever?
 If you have
trouble sleeping,
 your mom used to
count the stars.
 Sleep well.
 We're happy
to have you, Cassie.
 I'm Principal Chamberlain.
I knew your mother.
 I guess she didn't talk
about me much.
 Well, she never really talked
about her life here.
 Your mother was...
very special to me.
 Listen, if there's anything
that I can do
 to help you transition here,
you let me know, ok?
 Hey. Have you
seen her yet?
 She got in yesterday.
 And?
 She got in yesterday.
 So, you're the new girl.
 Uh, yeah.
That's me.
 You're very pretty.
 Try it again.
 That's Faye,
resident bad girl.
 Mmm. She's convincing.
 Hi, I'm Diana.
 I'm Cassie.
Cassie Blake.
 I know your grandmother.
It's a really small town.
 I got to run, but everybody hangs
out at the boathouse after school.
 It's right on the waterfront.
You can't miss it.
 So stop by, and
I'll show you around.

 You're Amelia's girl.
 - Excuse me?
- You got to be. I see it.
 Cassie.
 I heard about
your mother's accident.
 I'm sorry.
 You knew my mom?
 You bet I did.
 I loved your mother.
 Very much.
 And how did
my father feel about that?
 He didn't like it...
 But I was no threat.
Your mother chose him.
 Still...
 It was written.
 What is written?
 Our families are written
in the stars.
 We're destined.
It's always been that way.
 Dad.
What are you doing?
 No drinking
before dinner.
 Deal's a deal.
Hi. I'm sorry.
 This is Cassie,
Amelia's girl.
 She's beautiful, isn't she?
 I'm Adam.
 Cassie
so, uh...
 - This is your dad's place?
- Yeah.
 You can take a seat wherever.
I'll bring you a menu.
 Ok. Yeah.
 Here you go.
 You know, I saw you
at school today.
 Ah.
 How was
your first day?
 It's not over yet.
I'll get back to you.
 All right. I'll be
back in a minute.
 Adam's a hottie.
 You should make a play.
You're totally his type.
 - Stop it, Faye.
- What? It's true.
 I'm Melissa.
Nice to meet you.
 And I'm
Faye Chambelin.
 Yeah.
We met, sort of.
 Now it's official.
 Hey. Sorry to hear
about your mom.
 Thanks.
 And your father?
Where's he?
 Well, he died
just after I was born.
 My father's dad dead,
too.
 I still have
my mother, though.
 You probably met her.
She's the principal.
 Do not let her smile
fool you.
 She can be bitchy.
 Adam's cute,
don't you think?
 And he really does go for
the sad, delicate types.
 You know, I'm not feeling
all that delicate right now,
 so, I think
I'm gonna go.
 U two have fun.
 I don't think she knows.
Do you?
 I think she needs a nudge.
 Aah!
 No!
Come on, Cassie.
 Put it out.
 No!
Help! Let me, let me out !
 Put it out.
No!
Help! Let me, let me out !
 Put it out.
 Help!
Put it out.
 Let me out!
 Let me out! Aah!
 Adam!
 Come on. Come here.
 Are you all right?
 I just don't understand
what happened.
 Car caught on fire.
 Thanks for saving me.
 Hey, are you ok?
What happened?
 Hey. I think
her engine blew ?...
 No way.
 That was something else.
You saw it.
 It went up in flames.
 I'm gonna call
my grandmother.
 - Uh...
- Uh, no, no.
 You shouldn't
do that.
 Adam, why don't you
take Cassie home
 - No.
- Oh, no, it's ok.
 This is my boyfriend, by
the way. He's cool.
 It's really not a problem.
I'll take you.
 I'll call you later.

 Yeah.
I'm sure that's it.
 But the doors

 and you locked them when
you meant to unlock them.
 No, the lock's pretty

 It only does two things.

 Hi, Diana.
 Hi, Ms. Chamberlain.
Is Faye home?
 I'm right here.
 Got it, Mom. Thanks.
 What did you do
to Cassie's car?
 Why do you assume
I was the one that did it?
 Did you?
 It was stupid
and reckless.
 You risked exposure.
 I was testing her.
 We all wanted to know,
Diana. I cut to the chase.
 You could have hurt
Cassie.
 I didn't mean for the whole car
to go up in flames.
 That was her.
 Her energy connected
with mine.
 Everything you said
about the circle is true.
 With her here,
we have real power now.
 Which is why
we need to be careful.
 We can't control it.
 Then we should tell her.
 No. She needs time.
She just lost her mother.
 Look, we all agreed
to take it slow.
 No, you said to take it slow,
and we all nodded.
 I never agreed
to anything.
 We are doing this
my way, Faye.
 Yeah.
That ship has sailed.
 Do not push me, Faye.
 I mean it.
 Mmm.
 Do you want
to try that again?
 'Cause I didn't
quite buy it. Did you?
 Good night, Diana.
 Grandma?
 - Ooh. Sorry. My bad.
- No. That was my fault.
 Are you Cassie Blake?
 Yes.
 I was a good friend of
your mother's. I'm Charles.
 I'm so very, very sorry
to hear about her accident.
 Thank you.
 Cassie! Hey.
I see you met my dad.
 Oh. Hi.
 Well, it was very nice
to meet you, Cassie.
 You girls have fun.
See you at home.
 How are you doing
after yesterday?
 Not great,
actually.
 Anything I can do?
 Have you seen
my grandmother?
 Um, no.
Something wrong?
 You have no idea.
 Try me.
 Do you know how my car
caught on fire?
 I'm sure a mechanic
could tell you.
 Forget it. It's just number one
on my list of crazy.
 What do you mean?
 This town is
a friggin' side show.
 I mean... Look, never mind.
It's not your problem.
 I just...
I need to find my grandmother.
 Cassie, wait...
 I think maybe
I can help.
 Hello, Dawn.
 Hi, Jane. How are you?
 How's Cassie, by the way?
She's a lovely girl.
 Actually, I wanted to
talk to you about her.
 I don't know if you heard.
 Cassie's car caught fire
last night.
 Oh, my God.
Is she ok?
 She's fine.
 It's what caused the fire
that concerns me.
 I seem to recall a similar thing
happening years ago...
 kids fooling around...
 We both know
how that ended.
 Are the children
practicing?
 No, they can't be.
 We didn't know
anything.
 They're teenagers.
We didn't know
anything.
 They're teenagers.
 You better than
anyone should know
 how resourceful they can be.
 I would never have
allowed Cassie here...
 Look, I'm around
these kids every day.
 If they were practicing,
I would know.
 We can't let it
happen again.
 Look, if I see or hear anything,
I will let you know.
 Promise.
 Where are we going?
 You'll see.
 It's ok, Cassie.
 What is this place?
 Come on.
 Finally.
 Hey
neighbor.
 I'm Nick,
 also known as the guy in
the window.
 Hi.
 Ok. What are all of you
doing here?
 What's going on?
 We want to explain.
 I didn't want to
tell you like this,
 but I didn't have
a choice...
 She has
a right to know.
 Know what?
 Who you are.
 Ok . This is getting
really weird. I...
 Hey, you don't have
to be scared.
 Somebody tell me
what's going on.
 Look, Cassie,
 I know this is going to
sound crazy, ok, but...
 that fire yesterday...
 I don't know
how to say this. Um...
 We're different.
You're different.
 Oh, for God's sake,
spit it out.
 You're a witch.
 You're a full-blooded,
100% witch.
 We all are.
 There. Done.
 - This is beyond crazy.
- The truth works that way.
 Cassie, I know
how this sounds.
 The truth is, our ancestry is
part of a legacy
 that dates as far back
as 1692.
 You guys are saying
I'm a witch.
 Like your mother
and her mother.
 It's all in here,
Cassie.
 Each family has a book
like this one,
 a journal that lays down
each family line.
 I found mine...
 Which explains
her air of superiority.
 The book contains
thousands of spells.
 We've been practicing,
but without a full circle,
 we can only do
really lame ones.
 Like open locked doors.
Or curtains.
 Or set cars
on fire.
 I'm sorry about that.
 - I got a little out of hand.
- Complete circle is 6...
 one from each of
the 6 families.
 You're the sixth.
You complete the circle.
 - Now we're whole.
- We have more power now.
 But there's a ritual
that will bind us...
 so we can control
our power.
 You are seriously messed up.
Get out of my way.
 Don't pretend
you don't believe us.
 Deep down,
you know it's true.
 What's true is
how crazy you are.
 Hey, take it easy.
 She can't just waltz
out of here.
 She'll run
to her grandmother.
 No one can know about us,
not even our families.
 We have to stay secret.
 Fine.
 Great.
I knew it.
 Nicely done, Diana.
 Cassie! Cassie, wait.
 It's not as crazy
as it seems.
 Yes, it is. This is insane.
All of you are insane.
 Our parents had a circle
just like ours.
 Oh, my God.
Can you hear yourself?
 My mother was not a witch.
I would have known.
 No, 'cause it was
all covered up,
 'cause something went wrong.
People were hurt.
 They were killed.
So they abolished witchcraft.
 I don't believe you.
 You're not the only one who's
lost a parent, Cassie.
 We all have.
 There's no such thing
as witches and magic.
 I don't believe it.
 I can't.
 Let me show you.
 Here.
 It's ok. Trust me.
 Close your eyes.
 Ok. Now, concentrate
 on how your hand
is connecting with the leaf,
 then how the leaf
is connecting with the water,
 and say,
 "A drop of water,
as light as air,"
 and keep repeating it.
 A drop of water,
as light as air.
 A drop of water,
as light as air.
 A drop of water,
as light as air.
 I don't feel anything.
 Feel that?
 Tingling when my hand is
touching yours?
 That's your energy
connecting with mine.
 Now, try again.
 A drop of water...
 As light as air.
 A drop of water,
as light as air.
 A drop of water,
as light as air...
 Are you doing this?
 We are...
 This has never
happened before.
 You did magic with her?
 I thought if she knew what
she was capable of,
 she wouldn't be
as afraid of it.
 You made water float?
How romantic.
 And then, you let her
just run away.
 I lost control.
 Sounds like it.
 No, I lost control
of the magic.
 With Cassie here,
our power is magnified
 a hundred times over.
 Which is why we need to perform
the ritual.
 Yeah, and the sooner,
the better,
 before she blabs
to her grandmother...
 and anyone else
that would listen.
 She's not going to tell anybody.
 Oh, and he would know.
 They made magic together.
 All right, I'll swing by
her grandmother's.
 You guys have fun.
 - I certainly will.
- Where are you going?
 We have
to find Cassie.
 I'm not interested in
your little ritual.
 We have real power now.
 The last thing I want
to do is control it.
 And I'm not going to.
 This is exactly
what I was afraid of.
 You know
what she's like.
 Let's just find Cassie.

 Excuse me.
I need to talk to you.
 Hello, Amelia's girl.
 Why did my mom
leave here?
 You said you loved her.
What happened?
 Your father happened.
 Tell me about him.
 Do you know that our families
are aligned in the stars?
 Me and Amelia were meant
for each other.
 Yeah, you keep saying that,
 but I don't understand.
What does that mean?
 It's the same
for you and Adam.
 You don't want
to mess with fate.
 Bad things happen
when you mess with fate.
 What bad things?
Tell me.
 Why do you want to hurt
more than you already do?
 Please.
 Your father was
a bad man.
 Hello, Ethan.
 Is he bothering you?
 We're just talkin,
Charlie.
 It looks like you've had a little
too much to drink.
 Oh, I'm fine.
 Why don't we call it
a night?
 Ok, look.
We were just talking.
 What's going on?
 Your dad's in
a bad way again.
 Dad. Hey.
 We're gonna
go home now, ok?
 Cassie, wait!

 Skies above...

 Cassie.
There you are.
 No. I can't deal with
any more of this now.
 I know you're scared.
I know it's a lot to accept.
 Please.
 What happened to our parents,
 and why won't anyone
tell me anything?
 There was an accident
16 years ago.
 The people who died were all
members of the last circle,
 our parents.
 My father, too?
 Only I don't think
it was an accident.
 I think
something went wrong,
 and the ones who survived are
trying to keep it from us.
 Look, I believe we can do
great things with our power.
 It doesn't have to be bad,
but we have to control it.
 My mom ran
from this life.
 She didn't want this
for me.
 If she did, she would have told me.
 Why didn't she tell me?
 I don't know, Cassie.
 Please, sky,
rain down on me.
 More!
 What is she doing?
 Faye!
What are you doing?
 It's beautiful!
 You can't make it rain
just 'cause you want to!
 Yes, we can!
 We can do
anything we want!
 No, Faye!
Make it stop!
 Diana!
Are you ok?
 You have to stop it!
 Ok, I will!
 Stop this storm.
 Stop this storm!
 Do it!
I can't! I...
 Stop it!
Stop this storm!
 Make it stop.
 Make it stop.
 Make it stop.
 You did it.
You're one of us.
 You stopped it, Cassie.
 I don't want
any part of this.
 What happened to you?
 I... I just got caught
in the rain.
 Is everything all right?
 Yeah. I just...
I want to get out
 of these clothes.
 We're closed.
 We have a problem,
Ethan.
 What?
 You drink too much, which makes
you talk too much,
 and I can't have
that.
 What the hell
are you doing here?
 What would happen
if you slipped and fell
 off that dock outside?
 You'd drown.
 No one would find
your body for days.
 And do you know
what drowning is like?
 That feeling of not
being able to breathe?
 Gasping for air?
 Panicked as your lungs
fill up with water?
 It's a horrible death.
 This is my one
and final warning.
 Cassie?
You have a visitor.
 A very late visitor.
 I'll be in the kitchen.
 Right through there.
 Diana told me
what happened.
 Are they ok?
 Um, Faye's
a little shaken,
 and Diana's worried.
 Faye has always been
a bit unpredictable.
 You never know what she's
going to do next.
 Is that
why you came here,
 to convince me to join
your secret cult?
 No.
 I just wanted
to apologize.
 I'm sorry
about earlier.
 Which part?
 In the woods.
 I... I know.
 It should never
have happened.
 I don't know
how it happened.
 I love Diana,
you know.
 Yeah, I get it.
 Can't happen again.
 It can't.
 - Well, I should go.
- Yeah.
 You are one of us,
Cassie.
 I can't tell you
what to do,
 but just know...
You're not alone.
 Ahem.
 You and your tricks.
 They come in handy.
 Mmm. Ethan?
 - We spoke.
- Good.
 We did the right thing
bringing her here.
 She's got the gift.
 She is her father's
daughter.
 Unfortunately,
she's her mother's daughter, too.
 Are you sure you can get Cassie
to do what we need?
 I don't have to get her
to do a thing.
 The circle will take care of that
without even knowing it.
 My sweet Cassie.
 You finding this means
I'm gone,
 and for that,
I am so sorry.
 I didn't want you
to have this life.
 But destiny's not easy
to run from.
 I hoped that keeping this secret
would keep you safe,
 but all I've done is
left you unprotected.
 You have incredible power
inside you.
 People will come for it.
 They will come for you.
