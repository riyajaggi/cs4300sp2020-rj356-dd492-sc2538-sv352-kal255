 The Secret Circle (2011–2012): Season 1, Episode 11 - Fire/Ice - full transcript 
 Cassie asks Adam for help when she wants to look into her father's past, and their search leads them to an eerily familiar place. It also rekindles an old flame when Adam, thrilled to be spending time with Cassie again, asks her to the Fire and Ice dance. But because of her friendship with Diana Cassie is forced to give a surprising response. In an effort to be a better father, Ethan offers to chaperone the dance, much to Adam's dismay. Faye asks Lee to help her with a spell that would grant her individual magic. Unfortunately, the spell has some terrifying side effects that nearly destroy the Circle.

 Previously on
"the secret circle"...
 My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,
 and for that,
I am so sorry.
 I didn't want you
to have this life,
 but destiny's
not easy to run from.
 You're a witch.
You're a full-blooded 100% witch.
 A complete circle is 6.
 You complete
the circle.
 You have evil blood,
dark magic.
 You can't control it.
 We can all
figure this out together.
 Don't!
 I want to be
a real witch instead of
 this "spell
by committee" thing.
 "Lee Lebeque."
 Can I help you?
 - We need help with a spell.
- I know what you are.
 You're a witch.
 Grandma Kate, this is
my friend Cassie Blake.
 Amelia's daughter.
 You are also
your father's child.
 You know about him.
 The darkness
took him over.
 Can I stop it?
 There's a spell.
What is this?
 Elderberry.
 A death tree?
 You have to die.
No.
 Get me out of here!
 What have you done,
mother?
 She's John Blackwell's
daughter.
 I had to find out how
powerful her magic was.
 Let me out!
 You're in the same position as
you were when I woke up.
 Well, I...I know there is something
in here about my father.
 After what happened
with your grandmother,
 I just...I want to learn as much
about him as I can.
 I'm not sure looking into
all that is the best idea.
 Maybe you should
stay as far away
 from dark magic as you can.
 Jake said understanding
where it comes from
 is what can help me
control it.
 I don't think you should take
Jake's advice on anything.
 He's still
a part of the circle.
 We need him.
 What if he never
comes back?
 We won't be as strong,
 but we'll still
be better off.
 Jake was a witch hunter.
 And even if he started
to question that,
 in the end, he chose
to leave with them.
 Maybe a little distraction
could be a good thing.
 I'm helping out with the
fire and ice winter dance.
 You're coming, right?
 Uh, yeah.
 I guess so.
 Here's my issue.
 I love this dress,
 but we can only
wear red or white.
 Ok.
 Want to try
changing the color?
 Together?
 Uh-huh.
 Ok. You get that end.
 All right.
 Uh, let's go white.
 No? Red?
 Mmm, yes.
Good choice.
 Now this is a good use of our
ancient gifts.
 I know, right? Ok.
 Stitch, thread, and seam,
change from blue to red.
 Change from blue to red.
 That was me.
 # Da, da, da, da, da
 # da, da, da, da, da
 # da-da, da-da, da-da

 -Dad.
- Yeah?
 I just brought in
the steelhead delivery.
 - I'm heading out.
- Adam, wait.
 I gotta get to school.
 I, uh, volunteered to chaperone
at the dance tonight,
 help out.
 Ah.
 Now, you know they
don't serve alcohol
 at these high school
dances, right?
 I haven't had a drink
in a little while,
 couple weeks.
 Well, I hope
you stay with it.
 That's the plan.
 Adam.
 I can't change
the things I said to Diana
 about you and Cassie,
 but I promise
 I never meant to hurt you.
 I know.
 Diana, she's...
she thinks I need
 to figure out
my feelings for Cassie.
 Do you...
 Have feelings for Cassie?
 Yes.
 I felt a connection between us
the first moment we met.
 Maybe that's just
because you planted
 this ridiculous destiny idea
into my head.
 Heh. Maybe.
 But I think you'd know
the difference.
 Cassie, I wouldn't worry about it.
 Sometimes spells
just go wrong.
 And now I have a good excuse to
buy a new dress.
 Yeah, but we were
doing circle magic,
 and then my dark magic
took over.
 What if I'm never able
to do a spell again
 without something bad
happening?
 You don't know that.
 It could have
been a fluke.
 Wish I believed that.
 Hey.
 Hey, guys.
 How's it going?
 Actually I was thinking
 I need some nice, normal school
activities to throw myself into.
 Hmm.
 Any chance you need help
with the dance tonight?
 Yeah. That'd be great.
 How's Holden?
 He went back to school.
 I'm really gonna miss him.
 You're kidding.
 I was gonna ask him
to the dance.
 I guess I'm going solo.
 - I'm going alone, too.
- Me, three.
 We should all
go together,
 make a girls night
out of it.
 Or a girls night out and Faye,
if she wants to come.
 I can't quite
picture that, but I'm in.
 What is it?
 Probably nothing.
I'll, um...
 I'll meet you
inside.
 Hey.
What's up, man?
 Oh. Uh, sorry.
 Still haven't got the hang of it?
 And the day just
keeps getting better.
 I just wanted
to tell you
 that the final setup for
the dance starts at 3:00.
 And you think I care, why?
 Because your mom
signed you up
 for the decoration
committee.
 Hilarious.
 # And the first time
 # was the second time
 # you let him into
your heart... #
 Hey.
Hey.
 How you holding up?
 You mean after I was
almost buried alive?
 Yeah, that.
 My father is
the key to this.
 I have to find out
who he was.
 How?
 Well, he lived in town
for a while, right?
 He died here.
 There must be
a death certificate,
 police report,
something. It's...
 it's a start.
 City records.
 Right.
 Do you want
some company?
 Sure.
 # And the first time
 # was the second time
 # you let him
into your heart #
 # And the second time
 # was the last time
 # and then
 # and then it fell apart
 # it's never
gonna work out #
 Stalker much?
 Yeah, actually.
 I've been watching you,
your little friends.
 So I guess you
and Melissa aren't the only
 teen witches in town, huh?
 What are you
talking about?
 Oh, you know, blondie,
emo boy, girl scout.
 Eclectic circle
you got going.
 I think the voodoo
has gone to your head.
 And I think
you lost your magic
 after you bound
your circle.
 See? I told you.
 I can help you.
 You should go.
 Last time
I was in your garage,
 I broke
some of your toys.
 Hate to see something
happen to your car.
 A birth certificate?
Really?
 Plus photo I.D.
I can get you
 any public records
from the back,
 but all personal information
was digitized,
 and without proof
that you're related
 to the person
you're researching,
 I can't
give you access.
 Well, that's fair enough.
 Uh, but, hey,
while we're here,
 maybe you could help me
with something else.
 My dad owns
the boathouse restaurant
 down at sunset marina.
Sure.
 I know the place.
 Well, our neighbors
are being sticklers
 about us
taking down a tree,
 and so my dad wanted me
to check the property lines.
 That, I can
help you with.
 Give me a minute.
 Take your time.
 What are you doing?
 Get on the computer.
I'll keep an eye out.
 There's nothing...
 no date of birth,
nothing about the boatyard fire,
 no police report,
no coroner's report,
 not even a date of death.
 Search for
tax information,
 medical records,
an obituary.
 If he died here,
there has to be something.
 Wait.
 There's a deed
under his name...
 residence, 7 Briar Hill.
 7 Briar Hill?
 My God.
 What?
 I have to show you
something. Come on.
 What are we
doing here?
 I can't believe
your dad lived here.
 How did you guys
end up here?
 There was a map
in Diana's Book of Shadows
 that showed the confluence
of energy points
 in Chance Harbor.
 It brought us
to these woods.
 It's supposed to be where
magic is at its strongest.
 There's gotta be
something of his left behind.
 Wait.
 I remember throwing some stuff
in the basement.
 Show me.
 It's all just junk.
 Maybe we should just go.
 You know what I mean?
Come back tomorrow
 and check it all out
with fresh eyes.
 You go. I wanna
look around a little more.
 How 'bout I pick you up
later at your house?
 Maybe we could go to the fire
and ice thing together.
 I...I think we should
take separate cars.
 Cassie...
 Well, I don't want it to seem
like we're together together.
 That could hurt Diana.
 Diana has made it clear
that she's moving on...
 Like I should be doing.
 I am sure it is not
that simple for her.
 She has been there for me
since the day that I got here.
 I am lucky just to know
someone like her,
 let alone have her
as a friend. I...
 I can't do anything
to jeopardize that friendship.
 And what if you and I
really are meant to be together?
 I can't think
about that.
 It's funny,
'cause these days,
 I can't think
about anything else.
 How mini Martha Stewart
of you.
 I think
it's kind of fun.
 Are you really going
to the dance with Diana?
 And Cassie.
You should come.
 Oh, I wouldn't want
to ruin your power trio.
 Besides, I'm busy trying
to get my solo magic back.
 Lee claims he can help.
 Creepy fake voodoo guy?
 He's a scam artist.
 Or maybe he's not.
 His grandpa was
some big, bad voodoo king.
 And he is cute.
 In a serial killer living in his
mom's basement kind of way.
 And I should care
about your opinion
 because your taste
in men is so good?
 Up or down?
 Tough call.
 Down brings out
your eyes.
 Up shows off that neck and
your cleavage.
 Up it is, then.
 Remember when we used
to do this all the time,
 play dress-up
in your room?
 Steal my mom's clothes
from the attic.
 Your dad got so mad
the first time
 he caught us
putting on makeup.
 What happened?
 To us being friends?
 Faye, I guess.
 But we still did things together
for a while.
 Then came Adam.
 Right.
 Hey. Sorry I'm late.
 Where have you been?
The dance starts in, like, an hour.
 The abandoned house.
 That symbol
was carved into
 the ceiling
of the basement,
 I think
by my father.
 Why would you think that?
 Because
he lived there.
 What?
 Your father lived
at our abandoned house?
 Apparently,
but the weirdest part
 is I'm positive I've
seen the symbol before.
 Here.
 That's weird.
 The symbol your dad drew
is in your mom's family book. Why?
 What does it mean?
 No idea.
 Oh, there's
a page missing.
 These lines continue
onto the missing page.
 I bet there's more
about the symbol on it.
 But I've combed through this book
a thousand times.
 I would have noticed
a missing page.
 Must have been
ripped out recently.
 How?
 Who else has had the book
besides you?
 Faye.
 You're kidding.
 Why are you
looking at me?
 You think
I'm Faye's keeper?
 It had to be here.
There's no one else.
 You cleaned up
the place.
 Yeah.
 Next time you want
to trash my garage,
 give me a heads-up
 so I can hide
the expensive stuff.
 You know none of this
is expensive.
 What?
 We both know
why you're here.
 Ok, fine.
 Say I'm in a circle.
 What's that got to do with me
getting my own magic?
 Everything.
 I took a closer look
at the spell you gave me.
 This is
old-school voudon
 designed to extract
dark magic.
 Extract?
 Like an exorcism.
 Only, instead of
casting out demons,
 it pulls the dark magic
out of people.
 Or in your case, witches.
 I can take that magic
and put it into you.
 Listening.
 Well, if this book
is from someone in your circle,
 then the odds are
that their bloodline
 has the dark magic
we need.
 Whose is it?
 Emo kid's?
 The little blonde one,
Cassie.
 Really?
 I guess you can't judge a book
by its lip gloss.
 She doesn't even
want her power.
 So let's take it.
 But you should know...
 Dark magic
can turn on you.
 Are you ready
to take that risk?
 So if this spell takes away
Cassie's dark magic,
 what do I have to do to get it?
Stick pins in a little Cassie doll?
 Better.
After her magic's out,
 we tether it to you.
 Tether.
 Not some mind-meld thing,
is it?
 Because I do not want to be stuck
in that girl's head.
 Tethering links
your energies.
 Can you really do this?
 That depends on you.
 I don't have the power that
my grandparents did,
 but with your magic,
can make it happen.
 Does it hurt?
 It shouldn't.
 What about Cassie?
 She won't feel a thing.
 She doesn't even
have to be in the room.
 Somewhere nearby.
 And that's it?
 We need something first,
 something Cassie has
an emotional connection to.
 Can you get that?
 Of course.
 But what do you
get out of it?
 I told you.
I'm just the guide.
 Right, and I'm just
Glinda the good witch.
 You're not a "something
for nothing" kind of guy.
 Let's just say I'll ask you for
a favor someday.
 You're not getting laid.
 When we have sex, it's not
gonna be because of a deal.
 So are you in?
 Speak of the devil.
 Cassie?
 You ripped a page out
of my book, didn't you?
 - What book?
- Don't play dumb, Faye.
 You're the only one
I ever lent it to.
 One little page.
 From my mother's book.
You had no right to steal it.
 Right.
You're the victim.
 Poor Cassie.
 "I steal
boyfriends."
 Poor Cassie.
 "I almost
killed Adam."
 Poor Cassie.
 I am so sick of you
and your jealousy.
 Stop being pathetic,
Faye.
 Just give back the page.
 Fine.
 Are you going
to the dance tonight?
 Yes.
 Well, I wasn't going to,
 but seeing as you
obviously can't live without
 your precious page,
 meet me there.
 # All day, all night
 # I got the lights
in my eyes #
 # and I'm falling for you
 # keep cool, stay tough
 # but that's never enough
 # and these are
the lessons in love... #
 This'll be fun,
right?
 Right.
You're here with 2 other
 incredibly hot
single girls.
 When you put it
like that...
 I'll be right back.
 Hey, Mr. Conant.
 Oh, hey, Cassie.
 You having
a good time?
 Yeah. Thanks. You?
 Actually, yeah.
 I haven't been to one of
these things in a while.
 Do you mind if I ask you
about my father?
 Just no one else seems
willing to talk about him.
 I may have given you
the wrong idea.
 I know
you didn't like him.
 That fire
that he died in...
 That so many people
died in...
 Did he have anything
to do with that?
 Cassie...
 This is not a road
you want to go down.
 It doesn't matter
who he was.
 You didn't answer
my question.
 I need to know.
 What if I'm
just like him?
 No.
 He didn't
start the fire.
 And you're not defined
by your parents.
 It's your own actions
that matter.
 I am gonna find out who he was
one way or another.
 It's not what
your mother would want.
 Probably not,
 but she doesn't
have a say anymore.
 Thanks.
 # ...lessons in love
 # all day, all night
 # I got the lights
in my eyes #
 # I wanted money
 # 'cause money
don't lie... #
 You still miss him?
 Maybe.
 A little.
 Ecch.
 Mm, I get it.
 No matter what advice
anyone gives,
 the idea
of just moving on...
 Is impossible.
 No.
 Not impossible.
 We can't think that way.
 We're witches, damn it.
 We can get
whoever we want, right?
 You mean with magic?
 No, because we're tough...
 And we're witchy...
 And we're dressed
kind of slutty.
 You know what?
 You're right.
 We're all
of those things.
 I think you need to
take the initiative
 if you want to dance
with a guy.
 Everyone thinks you and Adam
are still together.
 Who would I ask?
 Dream big. Start
at the absolute top of the list.
 # You can see
right through me... #
 Aaron Wegner's cute.
 But I've never
really talked to him.
 No time
like the present.
 Come on, Diana.
 We're hot witches.
 You said so
yourself.
 Ahh.
 # Ice, ice,
ice, ice... #
 # Ice, ice,
ice, ice #
 # ice, ice, ice, ice
 # I'm ice, ice, ice, ice
 # ice, ice, ice, ice
 You sure they don't have
a silent alarm?
 You know, you're pretty jumpy
for a voodoo priest.
 I never said
I was a voodoo priest.
 That's what it says
on your stupid website.
 Let's get out of here
before I choke on all the girly.
 Voilà.
 Perfect.
 Let's go.
 Turn off the flashlight.
 I thought I saw something move
in the other window.
 Uh...
 You know, you're pretty jumpy
for a witch.
 # Check it out, uhh
 # yeah, yeah
 # from the moment when we met,
I was breathless #
 # and not asbestos
breathless either... #
 How did you learn
how to dance like this?
 My big sister got married last year,
made me take lessons.
 I'm glad it paid off.
 # ...dreams with
a kiss on the hand #
 # what up?
# little magnificent missing a man #
 # ran away, like kids
to a van, shyeah #
 # gorgeous,
walking on water #
 # sort of like Erin McNaught,
but little shorter #
 # wore a pandora,
bought her a charm #
 # wasn't short of a thought,
wore a Paul on her arm #
 2 triangles will draw
Cassie's power to you.
 So what? Do I chant
or something?
 No.
 Just have to feel it.
 Hey.
 Do you want to steal
Cassie Blake's power or not?
 Ok, let's do this.
 # Andale, andale
 # then break your door,
but come running back #
 # baby, I want you back,
but don't call me that... #
 Adam.
 Hey.
 Have you seen Faye?
 No. Why, are you
trying to avoid her?
 Uh, no.
 I, um...I found a symbol
in the house's basement
 that matched a symbol
in my Book of Shadows
 next to a page
that she ripped out.
 What symbol?
 # Gotta let your hair down
 # girl, gotta let
your hair down #
 # why we trying?
 # We ain't goin'
nowhere now... #
 I saw this
in "Spellcraft."
 It's a symbol used
for channeling dark magic.
 Your body is
a channel of energy.
 You have 5 major
energy points along the spine.
 It feels like...
 No talking.
 Fire and ice...
 It's a great theme.
 "Some say the world
will end in fire.
 Some say in ice."
 Robert Frost.
 Which way do you
think the world will end?
 Actually he was talking about
the end of a relationship.
 I saw you dancing.
 You seemed like
you were having fun.
 Yes, I was.
 I'm glad.
 Really, I mean it.
 I get it.
 Who knows what happens
down the road?
 But right now is
just not our time.
 Right.
 I think it's
everyone else
 who's having a hard time dealing
with our breakup.
 What do you mean?
 People are so used to us
being a couple
 that it's hard
to adjust.
 For who?
 Well, for Cassie.
 She wouldn't even accept a ride
from me tonight
 because she was afraid that
you'd get the wrong idea.
 That's stupid,
right?
 There's no reason I shouldn't
be able to give her a ride.
 Of course not.
 Eh, then maybe
I should talk to her.
 Yeah.
 I mean,
that would...
 Simplify things,
 rides and
whatever.
 Yeah. Then I will...
 Talk to her.
 Thanks.
 Have fun tonight.
 Give me the necklace.
 You are now open
to receiving Cassie's energy.
 You'll be tethered to her
through this.
 I can feel it.
 It's done.
 # Ohh, whoa, whoa, whoa
 # ohh, whoa, whoa
 # ohh, whoa, whoa, whoa
 # ohh, whoa, whoa
 # ohh, whoa, whoa, whoa
 Whoa.
 # Ohh, whoa, whoa
 You all right?
 You don't
look so good.
 I don't feel good either.
 You want to sit down?
 Yeah. Let me throw
some water on my face.
 # They wanna get my
 Lock unlock.
 # They wanna get my
 # gold on the ceiling
 # I ain't blind
 # just a matter of time
'fore you steal it... #
 Watch it.
 Don't stand
in the way.
 # It's all right
 # ain't no blood in my eye
 Look who's coming.
 Little miss powerless.
 There's no way she knows
that we took it, right?
 You're asking me?
 Did you bring the page?
 Oh, the page.
 No. I forgot.
 I'm sorry.
 Anything else?
 Wow. You just can't stop
being a bitch, can you?
 That girl is all ice,
no fire.
 # Sometimes
I just wanna... #
 Are you Ok?
 I just keep getting
these dizzy spells.
 What the hell?
 W-what's going on?
 Faye.
 What?
 Here. Take her.
 Ok. I got her. I got her.
Here.
 Hey, you're doing this,
aren't you?
 Why do you
have solo magic?
 If you must know,
I borrowed some of yours.
 What?
That page of yours
 was a spell to extract
dark magic.
 And since you have more
than you can handle,
 I didn't think
you'd mind sharing.
 Are you wearing
my necklace?
 Ripping a page out of
my book, that is one thing.
 Ripping away my magic, Faye,
that's just stupid.
 You're messing with power none
of us understand.
 You can't stand
seeing someone else
 do magic by themselves,
can you?
 Something was wrong
with Melissa,
 now Adam and Diana.
 Whatever you did,
it is not affecting me.
 It's hurting the rest
of the circle.
 # It's just another memory
to stay #
 # everything's
come out of place #
 # far away from...
 You said Cassie
would be the only one.
 You said she'd
barely feel it.
 Maybe her magic's
too strong to steal this way.
 Reverse
the spell.
 Hey, you wanted this.
 What did you expect?
 Power doesn't
come cheap.
 Besides, did you
see yourself in there?
 Fire and ice. You...
you're an artist.
 That's my circle in there.
 Tell me how to stop it,
or I'll use this power
 to turn your life
into a living hell.
 You know,
you talk a good game,
 but inside, you're just another
scared debutante.
 Too bad,
but it's your choice.
 Drop the necklace
in the oil.
 Then light it on fire.
 That will sever
the connection.
 And everything will go
back to the way it was?
 It should work.
 Stay calm. Stay calm.
 Stay calm.
 Go. Get out of here.
 Go, go, go, go, go!
 Faster, people! Faster!
 Hey!
 Wait. Where's Melissa?
 I don't know.
 Melissa.
 Melissa, get up!
 Ohh.
 Did you do this,
bring me out here?
 No.
 No, the...
 the last thing I remember,
I was on the floor,
 and then somebody
walked in.
 I saw their boots.
 M-maybe a fireman.
 I don't think so.
 We could have died.
 Do you know how
the fire started?
 I have a pretty good idea.
 I didn't mean
for anyone to get hurt.
 We're lucky
to be alive, Faye.
 You actually tried
that stupid spell?
 Don't play innocent,
Melissa.
 You were there
when I took it out of her book.
 I know I should
have said something,
 but I didn't want
to betray Faye.
 I'm sorry, Ok?
 You could have
burned down the school.
 You tried to steal
my power.
 You keep whining about how much
you don't want your dark magic.
 I was doing you a favor.
 You could have
destroyed the circle.
 When I realized
what was happening,
 I reversed the spell.
 This isn't
the first time
 you almost
killed someone
 and the rest of us have had
to clean it up.
 Are you kidding me?
 Cassie releases
a demon
 that ends up
killing Nick.
 Then she brings Jake
into the circle,
 and it turns out
he's a witch hunter,
 and then she almost chokes
Adam to death with her mind,
 yet I'm the evil one.
 Those things
were accidents.
 Like I tried to hurt
anyone on purpose.
 I just wanted a little indie magic
to play with.
 Miss innocent here is
full of dark magic,
 evil magic.
 How does this bitch
get a free pass,
 and I get burned
at the stake?
 Forget it.
Screw you guys.
 Adam!
 I lost track of you.
 Thank God you're Ok.
 I'm fine, Dad.
I'm fine.
 Fire marshal says
he's never seen anything like it.
 Yeah. It's weird.
 Thanks for the ride.
 You Ok?
 I don't know.
 I know this is
gonna sound dumb,
 but I feel bad for Faye.
 We were kind of harsh.
 Melissa...
 You could have died tonight
because of her.
 I know.
 But...
 Look, she's a little
wrapped up in herself.
 Everyone knows that.
It's just...
 She's your friend.
 She is.
 She just has her own way
of showing it.
 Must sound
pretty pathetic to you.
 Not at all.
 It's hard thinking
someone you've been close to
 is drifting away.
 I'm worried Faye is
doing more than drifting.
 Lately the only thing
she thinks about is power.
 She's starting
to scare me.
 To be honest, Cassie's starting
to scare me, too.
 She can't seem to control
her dark magic,
 and it's getting
more powerful.
 What happened to your
little circle pals?
 I'm done with them.
 But...
 Not with me.
 Not yet.
 Are you here
to pay me back?
 For the spell?
 It didn't work.
 I got you magic,
didn't I?
 The circle's magic,
not Cassie's.
 That's not my problem.
 I still got you power.
 You were the one
who gave it back.
 You think you got me,
too, don't you?
 Not yet.
 I barely knew
this basement existed,
 and suddenly it's
the busiest room in the place.
 What are you doing?
 Nothing.
 You said this symbol is
used to channel dark magic.
 It's part of the spell that Faye
used to try and take away mine.
 What if my dad was trying to take
away his own dark magic?
 You are not him.
 You don't need
to do this.
 I burnt Diana's dress
this morning,
 almost killed you
last week.
 Whatever this is,
I don't want it inside me.
 It is too dangerous.
 Didn't we learn
that lesson from Faye's
 mind-bogglingly stupid
behavior tonight?
 Maybe she didn't
do it right.
 It's not worth the risk.
 There has to be
another way.
 Come on.
Give me the spell.
 I mean it.
 Give me the spell.
 Your destiny
is important to me.
