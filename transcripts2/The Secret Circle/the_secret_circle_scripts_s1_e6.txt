 The Secret Circle (2011–2012): Season 1, Episode 6 - Wake - full transcript 
 After Nick was drowned to kill the demon who possessed him, his much more troublesome and equally attractive brother Jake Armstrong returns, who left Chance Harbor disgraced, nearly ruining Adam's family firm by theft, allegedly just for the funeral. The circle needs him, as he inherited Nick's magical place, so Adam must suppress his grudge, as scorned Faye, who plans to turn the tables on him. Jake proves his value in eliminating evil Simone, who tried to kill Cassie, but has a hidden agenda, as sole witch member of Isaac's slayer society.

"The Secret Circle"...
 My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,
 and for that I am so sorry.
 I didn't want you
to have this life,
 but destiny's not easy
to run from.
 Hi. I'm Diana.
 - You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.
 - We're different.
- You're different.
 You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded 100% witch.
 Here we have
real power now.
 A complete circle is 6.
 You complete
the circle.
 She's got the gift.
 You can get Cassie
to do what we need?
 The circle will take care
of that without even knowing it.
 Possession. Demons need human
form to be fully active.
 And now that the
demon has possessed Nick.
 I need a new body.
Yours'll do fine.
 You know what
we have to do.
 Drowning the demon is
the only way to save him.

 Good morning.
 Baking some things
for Nick's wake tomorrow.
 Grandma, there was a guy in
Nick's yard last night.
 It must have been
his older brother Jake.
 I didn't even know
Nick had a brother.
 Jake left town
a couple years ago.
 He was a troubled
young man back then.
 And now he's
lost his brother.
 We bound that circle with no
clue what we were doing,
 a-and look
what's happened.
 [Sighs] Maybe it's for the
best that it's broken now.
 It's not, Cassie.
 The circle is still bound.
 But Nick's gone.
 The ceremony you did doesn't
just bind you to each other.
 It binds you
to each other's bloodlines.
 Wait. Do you mean
Nick's brother?
 Yeah. Circles were
designed to last
 and to protect witches
and non-witches.
 Ok, I can't deal
with this right now.
 You have to know
to stay safe.
 How did this happen?
 I know it's a lot,
 but you're stronger
than you realize.
 Your lineage goes back to the very
beginning of witchcraft, Cassie.
 It's more powerful
than any of the others,
 and you were born
with the responsibility
 to lead and protect
your circle.
 Honey.
 Hey, daddy.
 I'm gonna go in to the office
for a few hours today.
 I won't be long.
 What's that?
 People are bringing
photos of Nick to the wake.
 I didn't think I had any.
 We weren't great friends.
 Then I remembered this.
 That's me and Nick,
isn't it?
 Yeah, when Nick
was little,
 he used to come
and look at the boats.
 Sometimes I'd take
you both out for a spin.
 I remember.
 He loved it,
but he was scared.
 He just clung
to your arm.
 I don't understand.
 That's his whole life?
 That's all he gets?
 I wish I had answers
for you, but...
 Hey.
 How you doing?
 Ok, thanks.
 - I'll put these in the kitchen.
- Oh.

 ♪ no one to see you... ♪
 You guys are putting
all this together?
 Nick's aunt left town
to stay with family.
 There's no one else.
 Well, his brother Jake
is in town,
 and we need
to talk about him.
 - Jake's back?
- Mm-hmm.
 He's not gonna miss
his brother's funeral, Adam.
 Yeah, he would.
 Guy didn't care about
anyone but himself.
 He's really
that awful?
 He used to work
at the boathouse.
 My dad gave him a job
when no one else would,
 and then he robs the place
one night after work.
 He stole everything
my dad had.
 They almost
lost the boathouse.
 Adam hasn't
forgiven him for that.
 No.

 Amy Leone stood up
in English lit yesterday
 and read this tragic poem
she wrote about Nick,
 something about thorns
and a rose or vine.
 Horrid.
 The whole thing
was pretty hilarious.
 Yeah. [Clears throat]

 - Oh, my God.

 Jake Armstrong is here.
 Adam.
 I heard you and your dad
were holding the wake here.
 Just wanted to stop by and say
I appreciate that.
 Um, we're glad to do it.
 That's great.
 No reason for you
and me to get
 bogged down in
ancient history, right?
 Like I said,
we're glad to do it.
 Hey, neighbor.
 Uh...
 Yeah. Uh...
 Hey.
 I'll see you guys around.
 ♪ When you wake up... ♪
 What was that about?
 You know him?
 No. Not at all.
 [Sighs] Thank God
he didn't see me.
 I have had an outfit planned for
this day for the last 2 years,
 and this was not it.
 I thought you
were past all that.
 He treated you
like such crap.
 Exactly.
 And now I need
to make him regret it.
 Yeah. That sounds like
a great plan, Faye.
 I gotta go.
 Melissa.
 I know you miss Nick.
We all do.
 But you can't spend
the rest of your life
 lying on your bedroom floor,
listening to depressing music.
 It's been 2 days, Faye.
 ♪ When you wake up... ♪
 I apologize
for not calling first.
 No problem.
 I'm gonna make
some tea.
 I have grief counselors
coming to the school,
 but it's hard to make sense
of such a senseless accident.
 Nick's death
wasn't an accident.
 The police say
he drowned.
 Nick was killed
by a demon.
 A demon?
 The children
have bound their circle.
 They released a demon
from Heather Barnes.
 Nick was its next host.
 He died
trying to drown it.
 The circle is bound?
 Oh, my God.
 That could have
been Faye.
 Are you gonna talk
to the elders?
 Have them strip the children
of their powers?
 No. They need it
to protect themselves.
 Can I count on your help
to watch over them?
 Of course.
 Thank you.
 There is no way I am gonna let
Jake be a part of this circle.
 According to my grandmother,
it's not up to us.
 He is by virtue
of his bloodline.
 That doesn't mean
we have to tell him.
 Don't we want to?
 You don't know him
like we do.
 He's hurt
a lot of people.
 You can't just replace Nick
with Jake.
 It isn't right.
 I'm sorry. I know
how hard this must be.
 Does he even
know about us
 or that he's part
of the circle?
 I doubt it.
 He left before
I found the book,
 before Nick knew.
If we let him leave,
 he takes
his power with him.
 It's either bring Jake
into the circle
 or leave ourselves
vulnerable.
 Who died and made you
queen witch?
 Sorry.
 [Air rushes]
What is that?
 What's going on?
 Is something
burning?
 Damn it.
 Who would do this?
 Melissa: Oh, my God.
It's coming straight for the house.
 We can put it out.
Come on.
 No air for fire...
 [Together]
No air for fire.
 No air for fire.
 No air for fire.
 No air for fire.
 Oh, my God.
 Look.
 Adam: What the hell?
 What is that?
 It looks like
a Crescent moon.
 Wait. Who could
have done this?
 Could be Jake
trying to scare us.
 He doesn't
know about us.
 Someone obviously does.
 And they burnt
this symbol to prove it?
 That doesn't
make any sense.
 Grandma.
 Cassie.
 There was a fire
at the abandoned house.
 Was anyone hurt?
 No. We put it out,
 but someone set it
intentionally,
 and there was a Crescent moon
burnt into the ground.
 Do you know
what it means?
 It's an ancient symbol
that means conquest.
 Conquest?
 It used to be burned onto
the ground of a witch's land
 to try and scare them,
 let them know
they'd been marked.
 You think someone
is threatening us?
 It certainly
looks like it.
 And when I saw Jake
last night,
 he was--he was setting
a fire behind his house.
 Have you talked to him
about the circle yet?
 - Not yet.
- Don't.
 Hometown parasite
returns.
 Got yourself all dolled up
just to come say hello.
 Cute.
 Get over yourself, Jake.
 I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about Nick.
 He was a good guy.
 That's why
you came down here?
 That...
 And I was bored.
 So where have you
been the last 2 years?
 Why? Did you miss me?
 No, not really.
 Sure, you did.
 You were always
so damn clingy, Faye.
 Screw you.
 Did you set
that fire today?
 What fire?
 You did, didn't you?
 Then tell me what the hell
you're talking about.
 Let's get
something clear.
 You don't get to tell me what
to do anymore.
 Jane could have
ruined everything,
 but I handled her.
 She thinks
we're allies.
 Charles,
am I boring you?
 No.
 Of course not.
 It's good.
Jane's handled.
 I'm sorry.
 I haven't been
sleeping very much.
 I know Nick's death
has been hard on you.
 Don't lose focus, Charles.
 This new bond with Jane might
be exactly the help we need.
 How?
 Every family had
a crystal at some point,
 and Jane's not just
any elder. She's a Blake.
 Now, there's a good chance
she might still have one,
 and if we can get
another crystal,
 then we can strengthen
the one we have.
 We can locate the others,
 and we can finally
get our powers back.
 Maybe,
 but it's hard to know
anything anymore.
 Are you sure you're
up to this, Charles?
 Because if you're not--
 I am.
 Hey, Diana, it's me.
 I talked
to my grandmother.
 Give me a call.
 [Footstep]
 Grandma?
 [Gasps]
Who are you?
 What do you want?
 Your blood.
 [Cassie screams]
 Aah!
 [Gasps]
Get off of her!
 Burning star,
blood-red eye.
 [Groans]
 Burning star,
blood-red eye.
 [Gasping]
 [Together] Burning star.
Blood-red eye.
 Burning star,
blood-red eye.
 Burning star,
blood-red eye.
 Who the hell was that?
 I have no clue,
 but she seemed pretty intent
on killing you.
 W-why?
 Sorry. I was too busy
 trying to save your ass
to ask her.
 So I guess you know
you're a witch.
 Yeah.
 Here. Sit.
 Oh. But you left town before Diana
found her Book of Shadows.
 I found my own book
years ago.
 I read enough of it
to know a spell or two.
 We have a circle. Your brother
was a part of it.
 Lot of good it did him.
 You're a part
of it, too.
 I don't want anything
to do with your circle.
 You're just
a bunch of kids
 in way over your heads.
 What were you doing
in your yard last night?
 Putting out a fire.
 Someone, probably that crazy
bitch that was just in here,
 burned a Crescent
into the ground.
 Well, the way you were
looking at the fire,
 I thought
you had set it.
 What's going on?
 Oh. Um,
a woman broke in.
 She took
a swipe at me.
 Jake stopped her.
 Oh, thank God
you're all right.
 I owe you a thanks,
 but I can take it
from here.
 [Chuckles]
I believe it.
 Good night.
 Good night.
 You tell me
exactly what happened.
 [Pop music playing
on the truck radio]
 So Cassie has no idea
who the woman was?
 No, and now she's just
out there somewhere.
 It's gonna be ok.
 Is it?
 I don't know.
 What the hell
is he doing here?
 Cassie.
 You ok?
 My God, Cassie.
 You didn't tell me
she hurt you.
 Jake heard me scream and
stopped her
 before she
could do much worse.
 We did a spell together
to send her away.
 So you know
you're a witch.
 Why didn't
you say anything?
 No reason to.
 I have no plans to stick around
Chance Harbor.
 Still should
have told us.
 Jeez, did I
hurt your feelings?
 Adam, Jake
saved my life.
 Yeah,
so you keep saying.
 It's pretty convenient
he happened to be there
 Adam.
 The knife
the woman used,
 it had a Crescent moon
on it.
 So she must be the one who burned
the symbol in front of the house.
 My grandmother
said it's a way
 to mark a witch
before an attack.
 She marked
his house, too.
 She could be a witch
from another circle.
 Maybe she followed you into town
from wherever you came from.
 I guess it's possible, but I've
never seen her before.
 Well, I'm just
glad you're ok.
 We should get going.
 I'm glad you're ok, too.
 I'll talk to Adam.
 Eh, sorry about that.
 I need to take care of things
for the funeral.
 I'll see you later.
 What's your problem?
 You know how much
I hate that guy.
 I have for years.
 It's different.
 You're acting like a jealous
boyfriend, and not mine.

 Ok, we need Jake to stay
in town,
 and I don't know
how to convince him.
 He has a life somewhere else.
Just let him leave.
 Cassie might be dead
if it wasn't for Jake.
 You have to get over
this thing you have about him.
 It's not a thing.
 Jake took advantage
of my father.
 He made a fool
out of him.
 That's
his specialty,
 making fools
out of people.
 So now you're
against this?
 So I'm not allowed to change
my mind, but you are?
 Ok, we need to put aside
all our issues.
 We've been marked, and there's
a psycho coming after all of us.
 We need all our power.
 If we can't
trust Jake,
 then I think we're
stronger without him.
 You know,
Nick wasn't perfect,
 but we knew
he had our backs,
 and it still
wasn't enough.
 When you and Jake
were together,
 it seemed like you
had a connection.
 You think we can
really trust him?
 If we let him leave,
we'll never know.
 You and Jake
were together?
 No.
 Just to warn you,
 he'll sleep with you,
then dump you
 and leave you in a million
twisted little pieces.
 But maybe
that's what you're into.
 [Winces]
 she moved so fast.
 We have to assume
she'll be back.
 My mom gave this to me,
 and if Amelia were here,
 she'd pass it on to you.
 This is what you used
on Melissa.
 Mm-hmm.
 Think of it
as a lens
 that magnifies
your power.
 Circle magic
is complicated.
 It involves other personalities,
other attitudes.
 The crystal
is simpler.
 It's a reflection
of you.
 [Chuckles]
 I don't think I'm the person
that you think I am.
 I can't even keep
the circle together.
 I know exactly
who you are.
 No one can know you
have the crystal,
 not even the rest
of your circle.
 It's the most coveted magic
there is,
 but it can bring out
the very worst in people.
 Ok?
 [Pounds on door]
 Simone.
 [Sighs]
Hey, Jake.
 Figured you'd find me.
 [Glass shatters]
 Why did you follow
me to Chance Harbor,
 and what the hell were you doing
marking my house?
 There's one answer
to both your questions--
 because you're a witch,
and I don't trust witches.
 You hate my kind,
I know.
 Well, I hate yours,
the true believer,
 so blinded with hate and sure of
their righteousness
 that they're frothing
at the mouth to kill.
 Give me the blood you took
from Cassie Blake.
 Get away from there.
 You don't want
to test me, Simone.
 It's too soon
for bloodletting.
 You just made
a big mistake.
 Stay the hell
out of my way.

 How can it still

 It was so long ago.
 That wake was
at the school gym.
 Amelia
wasn't there.
 I tried to look
for her,
 but she never
showed up.
 After everything
that happened,
 she was still
too distraught
 over Blackwell to go
to the funeral.
 Who's Blackwell?
 Don't listen to me.
 But you need
to slow down, ok?
 We are kind of
the hosts here.
 Yeah. You got it.
 Jake, what are
you up to?
 I know
it's something.
 No one changes that much
in 2 years.
 Adam, stop it.
 Forget it, Cassie.
He's probably loaded.
 Runs in the family.
 Diana: Stop this!
 Stop.
 What the hell
is wrong with you?
 Did you hear what he said
about my dad? Huh?
 That's not
what started this.
 Diana, wait.
 Just leave me alone.
 Ok, that was bad.
I'm sorry.
 I'm so sorry
about your brother.
 He didn't deserve
what happened.
 Thanks.
 You need anything,
 you come to me,
ok, Nick?
 It's Jake.
 I'm sorry.
 You ever think
that no matter what we do
 or how we try
to control our lives,
 that it's just
out of our hands?
 History just
keeps repeating.
 Come on, Charles.
 I saved you a place
at our table.
 People really
hate you, huh?
 Doesn't bother me.
 Maybe not,
 but you did run away.
 That was
a long time ago.
 My mom ran away, too,
 left here
and never came back.
 We moved all the time
from town to town, and--
 [chuckles]
 It was like she was hiding from
here, no matter where we were.
 I don't know if leaving
actually gave her any peace.
 Did it work for you?
 Peace isn't what
I was looking for.
 I didn't know you
back then,
 but you must have
found something,
 because underneath
all that attitude,
 you don't really seem like the guy
everyone should hate.
 All right, well,
 it should be safe
to go back inside now.
 I'm gonna hang here
a while.
 [Knock on door]
 Yeah.
 Mr. Conant.
 [Overlapping
conversations upstairs]
 Oh. Come on in.
 You disappeared.
 Saw the light on,
so I just thought...
 An old drunk like me could use
some coffee.
 I put milk in it
the way you like.
 Thanks.
 Poor Nick.
 You know, maybe if he had
someone like you
 to pick him up
when he was down...
 He did, actually,
 Melissa.
 Hmm.
 You love Adam,
don't you?
 Yes.
 He is so damn lucky
to have you.
 We're lucky to have
each other.
 I wish you were
the one, Diana.
 You deserve
to be happy.
 What?
 It's Adam's destiny to be with
Cassie Blake.
 Our families are written
in the stars--
 Adam and Cassie,
 me and Amelia.
 I should go.
 The sooner
you let him go,
 the sooner
you can be free.
 Trust me.
 Bad things happen
when you mess with fate.
 [Running footsteps]
 What are you doing?
Are you crazy?
 You think you and me have
enough magic to fly?
 Stop it, Faye.
 Is Jake in there?
 'Cause I am
so over him.
 Is that what this
is about, Jake?
 I have been through this
with you before,
 and he almost put you
in a psych ward last time, ok?
 You need to stay
away from him.
 I was a kid then.
Now I'm a wicked witch.
 [Scoffs]
 Where are you going?
 You just don't get it.
 Tonight isn't about you
 for once or Jake.
 Do you understand?
 It's a wake for Nick,
and I loved him.
 I know.
 He loved you, too.
 You know, I can tell you're
actually thinking about yourself
 and what you wish you had
with Jake when you say that.
 [Laughs]
 But still,
it means a lot.
 Thank you.

 Adam.
 I can't help
how I feel.
 Everything's just so screwed up
right now.
 We're all hurting, Adam.
 Maybe it's
easier for you
 because you don't know anybody,
not really.
 That is not fair.
 I may not have
been here my whole life,
 but you guys are the closest
thing I've ever had to real friends,
 especially Diana.
 None of this is easy.

 You know, I hope I'm wrong
about Jake. I really do.
 I don't think I am.
 I'll be right back.
 I saw you

 You were closer to kissing her

 You're never gonna be able
to complete the mission.
 I told you to stay
out of my way.
 I'm not done here.
 I am.
 Oh, my God.
 [Truck pulling up]
 [Door closes]
 So she was a witch?
 Pretty nasty one.
 Seemed like you two
were talking.
 She said she was here
to scavenge power.
 She knew
a witch had died.
 That's what
scavengers come for.
 It's scary how much
stuff is out there,
 how much I don't know.
 Cassie, the way her knife flew
out of her hand,
 did you do that?
 Because I thought
once a circle was bound,
 you can't do magic
on your own.
 No. I--I saw that.
 I thought it was you.
 Maybe it was
the both of us
 somehow.
 Jake, you can't leave
Chance Harbor.
 I have to.
 No, you don't.
 We are all
bound together,
 and I know that's not something
that you ever wanted,
 and, trust me,
neither did I.
 But it's not something
that you can run from.
 If you really knew me, you
wouldn't want me to stay.
 I don't think
that we have a choice.
 The bad is coming.
 They're here.
 It's what killed
your brother and our parents
 and almost you tonight.
 We can't do this
without you.
 We are not strong enough.
 And if we don't try,
then Nick's death
 is gonna seem a lot more senseless
than it already does.
 You've got all
the answers, huh?
 No, not usually.
 Heh.
 Maybe I'll stick around
a little while.
 There are still
a few people around town
 that haven't tried
to kick my ass.
 Hey.
 What happened?
You disappeared.
 I went for a walk.
 I'm sorry
for the way I acted.
 Your dad told me
about you and Cassie
 being destined
to be together.
 It's just an old story
to make him feel better
 about being in love
with Cassie's mom.
 That's what I want...
 The kind of love that makes
you want to believe in destiny.
 That's what we have.
 No,
 because if we did, I wouldn't
feel like I do right now.
 Diana...
 I love you.
You know that.
 There's a way
you look at Cassie
 that I could
never understand,
 and I think
I get it now.
 It's wonder,
 wondering if every time you find
yourselves together,
 it's choice
or destiny.
 You need
to figure out which.
 Diana, please.
You're wrong.
 No. I've been standing
on the sidelines,
 watching it
since she got here.
 I can't do that
anymore.
 [Dog barking]
 [Knock on door]
 Hey.
 What's wrong?
 I broke up with Adam.
 What happened?
 You.
 Uh, Diana--
 well, just tell me
what to do.
 I never meant
for any of this to happen.
 I honestly don't know.
 I don't even know
why I'm here.
 I guess because
he was my best friend,
 and I have
nowhere else to go,
 no one else
who really knows me.
 [Sobbing]
 You killed Simone.
 Why?
 You mean aside
from the fact
 that she tried
to gut me with a blade?
 Don't get smart
with me, Jake.
 I will
gut you myself.
 [Sighs]
 You killed a fellow
witch hunter.
 Why?
 Cassie saw her
talking to me.
 I lied and said
she was a witch,
 but it could have
been a disaster.

to follow protocol,
 and that's

a mistake

to kill witches,

 to rid Chance Harbor
of witches,
 and I will not fail.
