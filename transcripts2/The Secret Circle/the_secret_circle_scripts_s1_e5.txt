"The Secret Circle"...
 My sweet Cassie,
you finding this means I'm gone,
 and for that I am so sorry.
 I didn't want you
to have this life,
 but destiny's not easy
to run from.
 Hi. I'm Diana.
 You seen her yet?
She got in yesterday.
 - We're different.
- You're different.
 You're a witch. You're a
full-blooded 100% witch.
 Here we have
real power now.
 A complete circle is 6.
 You complete
the circle.
 She's got the gift.
 You can get Cassie
to do what we need?
 The circle will take care
of that without even knowing it.
 And my mother did something to
Heather that was worse than death.
 She hasn't moved
in 16 years.
 She had to be the one
to put the spell on Heather.
 Wherever there are witches,
evil follows.
 They were trying to use
your mother's power.
 I tell you, she was
trying to stop.
 Demons!
 We need to know what
happened 16 years ago.
 Wake up. We're late.
 Are you dead? Hmm?
 Oh.
 Ohh. Oh, I have
such a headache.
 Mmm...
 Ugh! Get off!
 What the hell?
 I said my head hurts.
 I'm sorry.
I just really don't feel well.

 Did you get any sleep
last night?
 A little.
 I can't believe you witnessed
that terrible accident.
 Poor woman.
 I know.
 She was a friend
of your mom's--
 Heather Barnes.
Did you know that?
 No.
 She'd been ill
for a very long time.
 Homebound.
 I can't imagine
what she was doing
 in this neighborhood.
 What were you doing
last night?
 Um, nothing, you know,
just coming home.
 Where from?
 Uh, nowhere.
 Just hanging out.
 Oh, with Diana,
Faye Chamberlain, those girls?
 Yeah. Is that bad?
 No. Not at all.
 I'm glad you've made
friends so quickly.
 It makes sense, I guess,
 that you'd find each other.
 What do you mean?
 Just that you have
so much in common.
 Your parents were all
such close friends.
 Well, it's a small town,
I guess.
 Your mother and her friends
went through a lot together.
 Ultimately,
a lot of tragedy.
 Um, I should get going.
 School.
 How about I make us
a nice dinner tonight?
 I'd love to catch up.
 Sure.
 There's nothing that you
can't talk to me about.
 You know that, right?
 Mm-hmm.
 Watch it!
 I beg your pardon?
 I'm so sorry,
Mrs. Chamberlain.
 I don't know what's
gotten into me today.
 I just feel
really awful.
 Ok, it's fine. Just, please,
watch where you're going.
 I will. I'm sorry.
 Why can't I tell
my grandmother?
 Maybe she can help us.
 What if she tells my dad or any
of our parents? Then what?
 I have no idea what.
You tell me.
 They've lied to us
our whole lives.
 They obviously don't
want us to know anything.
 If they find out we do,
this might all be taken away.
 Our magic? How?
 One of the last entries
in my book
 talks about our parents' circle
being punished for their actions,
 having their powers
stripped away.
 By who?
 The book refers
to the Elders.
 We think that means
the generation before.
 Like my grandmother.
 So she still has
her powers?
 I think so.
All the more reason
 not to tell her
we're practicing it.
 I hate lying. I'm supposed to
have dinner with her later.
 Another night of pretending
to be someone I'm not.
 I get it, believe me.
But the answers we all want
 about what happened
16 years ago,
 what if exposing ourselves
means we never find out?
 Heather Barnes was killed outside
the Blake house last night.
 Yes, I'm well aware.
 Right in front of our kids.
 You think she said
anything to them?
 She was supposed to be
catatonic for the rest of her life.
 I'm not even sure how she was
able to get out her front door.
 But we always knew binding
the circle might attract
 unwanted attention.
 But I never thought
they'd face this kind
 of danger, not so soon.
 The more they're confronted
with, the more they'll dig.
 And we're not equipped yet
to protect them
 from what they might find.
 We will be.
The Blood Moon's tonight
 and I've got
everything ready.
 Be at the boat at 10:00.
 You don't want to miss it.
 No, we don't.
 What do you say
we go back to using phones
 for these kind
of conversations?
 It's so nice to see you
in person.
 Oh, your dad's here.
 You're probably
getting expelled.
 You don't know?
 Know what?
 Our parents are dating.
 It's cute, huh?
 Uhh!
 God!
 Aah!
 Are you ok?
 Nick.
 Yeah, Nick.
 Are you all right?
 Yeah, I'm fine.
But I need your help.
 What?
 I found my family's
Book of Shadows.
 Seriously?
 Mm-hmm. But I don't
want the others to know.
 Where'd you find it?
 I was looking
for a necklace
in my mom's stuff
 and I found her diary.
She writes all about
 hiding our family's book in
the forest for protection.
 Will you help me
find it?
 It'd just be for us,
you and me,
 doing all the spells?
 That could be fun.
 Our secret.
 You must have
read it wrong.
 There's nothing down here.
 Trust me, it's there.
 I am done. I'm about
to pass out.
 Stop being such a wuss
and dig.
 Hey.
 What the hell?
 This thing weighs a ton.
 Uhh! Uh!
 Are you sure
the book's in there?
 This is exactly
what we're looking for.
 How's the chicken?
 Mmm. Delicious.
 Thank you.
 School?
 Fine.
 You know, it's school.
 Pretty soon we're gonna be
talking about the weather.
 Sorry.
 What?
 The way you just
wrinkled your nose
 exactly like your mom.
 Really?
 What was she like,
at my age?
 Well, like you,
beautiful.
 Strong.
 So smart.
 Why did she leave here?
 Your mother kept
a lot of things from me.
 She didn't think
I'd understand.
 You might feel
the same way.
 When she was in trouble,
 I did not see the signs.
 If we were closer,
if she'd come to me,
 I could have helped.
 I'll never forgive myself.
 You know, once mom
got something in her head...
 Ah. See? You know her
better than you think.
 Please don't make
the same mistake, Cassie.
 Everything ok?
 Fine.
 Ready for dessert?
 Actually, I have to
meet someone.
 But I won't be late.
 Thank you for the dinner.
 Mm.
 I'll be back soon.
 Well, let's just open it.
 What's your problem?
Don't touch it.
 This is what
you wanted--the book.
 My mom put a spell on it
to protect it and keep it safe.
 It won't open until
we undo the spell.
 I'll get it started.
 The lock's ancient.
 I bet I can get it open.
 No means no.
Do you get it?
 What's the emergency?
 Tell me this has nothing
to do with your sex life.
 It's a surprise.
 Just give me a minute
to prepare the spell.
 You text me
to rush over here
 and now you want me
to wait.
 With him.
 Wait!
 I found my mom's
Book of Shadows.
 Hey. I thought we said we
weren't gonna tell anybody.
 She's my best friend.
Don't be an idiot.
 Another book.
Really?
 Where?
 So, let's open it.
 There's a spell
on the lock.
 Did you tell Diana
about this?
 No. Just us.
 And him?
 I needed him
to dig up the suitcase.
 The book is for you and me.
 I thought the book
was for you and me.
 Are you gonna hold it
over me like Diana does?
 Never.
 You're my best friend.
 There is nothing
 I wouldn't do for you.
 Uh--
 Hi, Dawn.
 Am I early?
 You said 10:00.
 No, you're right on time.
 Wine?
 No. Um...
 We've got work to do.
 Of course. I've got
everything set up.
 I just need to light
these candles.
 We've still got
15 minutes.
 You sure you don't
want something to drink?
 Fine.
 You want these crystals
as much as I do, right?
 Of course I do.
 To get our true power
back, it means everything.
 Then don't lose focus.
 Mmm. Since when
do you cook?
 Never. But I just found
the recipe online
 and followed directions.
 This was amazing.
 You're lying.
 I know, it's disgusting.
I'm a horrible cook.
 Not if cooks are judged on
effort and adorableness.
 I miss this.
 It feels like we haven't
been alone in forever.
 Remember when we were the only
two witches, me and you?
 Yeah, and then you had to
go and ruin everything
 and tell the others.
 Sometimes I wish I never
found the book,
 that it was just
you and me again,
 being normal.
 Well, maybe tomorrow
I'll cook you something horrible.
 Time for dessert.
 Should I get bowls
or spoons?
 We're not gonna need
any of them.
 Ah.

 I got your text.
 You told her?
 What the hell, Melissa?
 How many witches does it take
to open a suitcase?
 Six, I think.
 - What?
- I'm sorry.
 I didn't think you'd come
if you knew,
 but we need the entire circle
for this spell to work.
 Why? What's in there?
 Melissa's
Book of Shadows.
 Really? Well, let's see it.
 Why is everyone in such a rush
to open the damn suitcase?!
 Why don't I check to see
where Adam and Diane are?
 Tell them to hurry. They haven't
been responding to my texts.
 Yes, definitely
tell them to hurry.
 Did you see that?
 - What's wrong?
- This suitcase moved.
 Suitcases don't move.
 This one did. Ohh!
 It moved again.
 Just stay away from it!
 Melissa,
what's in the suitcase?
 You'll see.

 Who keeps texting?
 What?
 It's Cassie.
 They're in trouble.
 What the hell
was with her face?
 It's the same thing
that was in Heather.
 A demon?
 I guess. I've never seen
a demon before.
 Do they look like snakes
and crawl inside people's skin?
 Let's get the hell
out of here.
 No, we can't leave. We have
to get that thing out of her.
 How? My mother
couldn't help Heather,
 and we don't know
half the magic that they did.
 I don't care.
We have to save her.
 - You're right.
- Fine. How?
 - Guys?
- I don't know.
 Are you ok?
 Uhh!
What the hell?
 It's not what you think.
 Not even remotely.
 I guess it's possible
the demon got out of Heather
 and found its way
into Melissa.
 So what's in the suitcase?
 Well, I'm guessing
it's not a Book of Shadows.
 Aah!
 Aah!
 I got her.
Hold her, Nick.
 Grab her arm.
I got her! Tighter!
 Let go of me!
 Get off me!
 Aah!
 Get away, Jess.
Get away.
 What just happened?
 Melissa?
 Nick.
 Oh, my head.
 What happened?
 What's going on? Why are you
all staring at me like that?
 Are you ok?
 I can't feel my hands.
 These things are
cutting into me.
 Let's get
these things off.
 Don't do that.
 It's not her.
 Of course it is.
 No, she's faking.
 Nick, don't listen to them.
I'm in pain.
 You worthless loser!
 What are we gonna do?
She's going to hurt herself.
 We can't just keep her
tied up forever.
 I can try the book, but it's
way out of my league.
 I know what to do.
 But you have to trust me.
 It's time.
 Let's do it.
 This crystal will absorb
the moon's light,
 refract it onto the map,
and identify the others
 in relation
to its position.
 Six crystals, once joined
together as one...
 and connected even now.
 Thrughain adhar,
 thruagort isham.
 Thrughain adhar,
 thruagort isham.
 Thrughain adhar,
 thruagort isham.
 Thrughain...
 Adhar...
 Thruagort isham.
 No.
 There's not enough power.
 - Let's try it again.
- The crystal's dead.
 We used it too often.
Damn it.
 Just give me
your hands--
 Don't you get it, Charles?
 It's done.
 We waited a year
for this Blood Moon.
 But at least
we've bound the circle.
 Without 5 more of these,
the circle can't restore
 a power. We have nothing.
 Look, I'll find
another way.
 No.
 I was an idiot to think
you could help me.
 Grandma!
 What is it?
Are you all right?
 You said you can help me.
You said I can trust you.
 Of course you can.
Slow down. Catch your breath.
 There's no time.
We're in trouble.
 Who is? Tell me what's wrong.
 I know who I am.
 Who you are,
who mom was.
 I'm a witch.
 And I need your help.
 Was that a hiss?
 Rrarrrhh!
 Uhh!
 Do as I say or I will
cut his throat!
 Melissa, don't do this.
Melissa, please.
 Listen. Hey, come on.
 Come on, fight it.
Please.
 Fight it. I know
you're in there.
 I know you can hear me.
 Yes. And I am telling you
 to shut up!
 Melissa, no!
 Aah!
 Come on,
there's 3 of us.
 Don't mess around.
 We're not doing
what she says.
 Faye, no.
 Focus on the shears.
 Heat of the sun,
burn like fire.
 Heat of the sun,
burn like fire.
 Heat of the sun,
burn like fire.
 Heat of the sun, burn like fire.
 Heat of the sun,
burn like fire.
 Heat of the sun, burn like fire.
 Heat of the sun,
burn like fire.
 Heat of the sun, burn like fire.
 Hey, stop, stop.
 Any other magic tricks
you want to try?
 No? My turn.
 Faye, use that to form
a circle around the case.
 Please just do it.
 Now say this with me--
 incipio serpus malum.
 Say it!
 Incipio serpus malum.
 Incipio serpus malum.
 Incipio serpus malum.
 Incipio serpus malum.
 Incipio serpus malum.
 Incipio serpus malum.
 Incipio serpus malum!
 I brought help.
 What...
 You're too late!
 Kleidaria klodanum.
 - Repeat the spell.
- No!
 Then his blood
is on your hands!
 Aah! Uhh!
 You bitch.
 You don't have the power
to stop me,
 old woman.
 I'm not alone here.
 What, them?
They're nothing.
 I didn't mean the children.
 Get that away from m-me.
 Cassie, get my bag.
 Someone break that circle.
Hurry.
 Take the 3 candles.
Place them around the bag.
 Light them in a circle
clockwise.
 Now the sage.
Burn some in each candle.
 Hurry up.
We don't have much time.
 Melissa? Melissa,
I know you're in there.
 I saw you. I saw you.
Come back to me.
 Come back to me, please.
 White wine, please.
 No. Uh, bourbon.
 Stop! What is going on?!
 Cassie, get the stick
out of the bag.
 No!
 Consummetum est.
 Light it.
 No, please.
 Oh, God. No!
 No, stop it!
Diablo fuge.
 Diablo fuge.
Stop it!
 Stop!
 Oh, Nick, help me, please!
 She's not possessed.
Let her go.
 Possessed?
What are you talking about?
 The demon's gone?
 From Melissa,
but it needs a host.
 It's in someone else.
 Someone in this room.
 How do you know
it's not him?
 Diana, come on.
 It could be anyone.
 Yeah, well,
I vote for you.
 What about grandma?
 She's the one with
all the crazy ideas.
 - She saved us.
- Stop!
 Stop!
 Stop!
 Stop him! Stop him!
 Nick!
 Carefully.
 What are they?
 Demons, in the form
of snakes.
 Do you have
any lighter fluid?
 Um...Yeah, right there
on the table.
 The only way
to destroy a demon
 is to drown it
 or burn it.
 Right here.
Ok.
 On the concrete.
 1...
 2...
 3!
 - The lock!
- Take these.
 Get back!
 No, get back!
 Oh!
 Oh--ohh!
 We have to find Nick
before he hurts someone.
 I'll call his aunt and tell her
to call if he shows up there.
 What's he trying to do?
 I mean it--
what does it want?
 Possession. Demons need human
form to be fully active.
 And there's no more
powerful form than a witch.
 It's Nick.
 Adam, I'm gonna need you
to bring me the suitcase
 to the boathouse.
 If you don't,
I'm gonna burn this place
 to the ground.
 You can check,
but I'm pretty sure
 your dad's passed out
in the back room.
 He wants me to bring him
the suitcase or he'll
 burn down the boathouse.
 My dad's in there.
 I'll go.
 I'm coming with.
 - No.
- Yes.
 You're gonna need help.
 Then we're coming, too.
 Hello, Dawn.
 Hello, Nick.
 It's Ms. Chamberlain
to you.
 Nick's not here anymore.
 And who are you?
 I believe the name you used
when you helped summon me was...
 Abaddon.
 We meet again.
 Oh, my God.
 We have unfinished business.
 What do you want?
 I've come to do
what I was meant to do.
 I want the circle.
 No.
 Leave the children alone.
 They're coming here now.
 For Nick.
 I need a new body.
 Yours will do fine.
 Not here.
 Hello?
 Let's go someplace private.
 What about the drydocks?
 Nobody can hear us there.
 We can talk this out, Nick--
 or Abaddon--no one else needs
 to be killed.
 Do whatever
you want to me.
 Just, please,
leave them alone.
 I'm afraid I can't do that.
 I just want
what you want--
 the circle.
Their power.
 They're not strong.
 They don't know anything.
 They're strong.
 What now?
 You know what
we have to do.
 The crystal has no energy.
 And without that power,
there's nothing else we can do.
 We have to drown it.
 For God's sake, Dawn.
 He was coming
for the children, Charles.
 All of them.
 We don't have a choice,
 and you know it.
 It's a risk,
but drowning the demon
 is the only way
to save them.
 Come on.
 Damn it, Nick,
where are you?
 I'll check outside.
 I'll check the back.
 Mr. Meade.
What are you doing?
 Don't listen to him.
That's not Nick.
 Stop it, please.
Please! Please, stop!
 Stop it! Stop!
 Do it quickly.
 Please stop--
 - Damn it.
- What's happening?
 He won't die.
 Nick.
 Don't let him up!
 How do you feel?
 Mm...Ok.
 What happened?
 You don't remember?
 Demons.
 Possession.
 Being really mean to me.
 Ever since I woke up
this morning,
 I just...
 Everything's
so blurry in my head.
 I'm really glad that you're ok.
 Where is everyone?
Where's Nick?
 Hi.
 Yeah.
 Ok.
 We killed a boy tonight.
 We killed a demon.
 And think of who we saved.
 It was the right thing to do.
 There was nothing right
about that.
 I killed a boy, a child.
 That's something
that should never...
 Feel right.
 You saved my life.
 Thank you.
 They're saying he hit
his head when he fell in.
 At least that's what
the police think.
 They're calling it
an accident.
 So he drowned?
 Maybe he was trying to
get the demon out himself.
 He always had it worse
than any of us.
 You know? Both parents.
 Never knowing
who he was.
 I know.
 If I lost you,
I couldn't take it.
 You're not gonna lose me.
 Promise?
 If I would have told you
about the circle sooner,
 he'd still be alive.
 It's not your fault.
 None of it.
 There have been too man
secrets for too long.
 And I don't want to to be like
that between us anymore.
 Then, please, tell me...
 What happened
the night of the fire?
 Why did my mom run away
from here? From you?
 I wish I knew.
 But I never have.
 I miss her.
 Every day.
 So do I.
 What good is magic if you can't
save the people you care about?
 I wish it was that simple.
 Ours is not
an easy life, Cassie,
 and witchcraft has never
been about fun and games.
 It's dangerous.
 And it attracts darkness.
 That is why your mom
was trying to keep it from you.
 Why I wanted
to keep it from her.
 Well...
 It didn't work, did it?
 No, it didn't.
 It never does.
 I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you, Cassie.
 I promise.
