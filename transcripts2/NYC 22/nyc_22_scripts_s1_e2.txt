 All right, listen up. First order of business, let's welcome our rookies to their first midnight tour. This is one in a long list of things you're gonna do in your first year. Contrary to popular belief, midnights is not a punishment shift, unless you're Martini and Moore. Everyone here wants to be here. Better than being with my wife. Really, 'cause I was with your wife last night, and I thought she was... All right, all right, all right. Per your training sergeant,

 Perry, you're with McLaren. Toney, you're with Khan. Sanchez, why don't you stay with Harper. Sergeant Howard? Anti-Crime has gotten some intel on one of our baby gangs, the Mafia Skull Crackaz. Apparently, they're looking to grow up fast. Word is that they're hanging out with big fish, and they're looking to score guns. So, you hear, you see anything, I want to be the first one to know, all right? All right, that's it for tonight. Stay safe, and I'll see you on the other side.

 Sarge, what gives? Different tour, different teams. Keeps it interesting. Aw, I know you're gonna miss me. Just try not to cry. Those are tears of joy. Is it our destiny to be like that? I hate to break it to you; you're already there. Some cops are just creatures of the night. 20 years of moonlight. Or 20 years of bear claws. Uh, you know a rapper named Monsta White? Yeah, Monsta, we shuttered many clubs back in the day. Why? He's playing a cop in a movie. He wants to shadow you for a few tours. Uh, boss, honestly, I'd rather not. Yeah, I'd rather you not, too, but this is coming direct from the Puzzle Palace. What, the toy store? Headquarters. The commissioner's son is a big fan. So, he's gonna meet you here. You and Khan do your patrol as usual. Try not to get him killed. Tonight? Yes, tonight. Okay, let's hustle. Would you look at this? It's, like, busier now than it is at 4:00 in the afternoon. You got the guppies, the yuppies. You got the old school, new school, middle school, Rastafarians, trustifarians. Man, if I didn't know better, I'd think we were in the Lower East Side. See that? That's old-school Harlem right there. Christmas lights up all out of season. Yeah, that ain't old-school nothing. That's just plain lazy. Jersey plates? Maybe looking for an address. Did you see what I just saw? I do believe I did. I did. How you doing? 22 post 32. Uh, could I have training sergeant 85 me non-emergency at 121 and Adam Clayton Powell. 10-4. Post 32, roger. You've worked this foot post before. Is it always this quiet, or it's just the midnights? Depends on your definition of quiet. Don't you know it's bad luck to desecrate the dead? T? What are you doing? Who are you here with? Nobody. Who wrote on that tombstone? Nobody? Maybe Nobody needs to be taught a lesson before Nobody gets into bigger trouble. You heard the man. You're under arrest, Nobody, for tagging. Hang on, I got a better idea. Well, if it isn't Beauty and the Beast. What's up? That house with the lights, are they dealing out the front door? Purple Haze and Hindu Kush to be exact. So what are we going to do about it? Leave them alone, and they'll leave us alone. We have an unofficial "live and let live" policy with that house. They've been here longer than any of us. With them here, the rest of the neighborhood stays quiet. Plus they've given us gun collars, tipped us to robberies. Oh, I see. So, as long as you're the friendly neighborhood drug dealer, you get a pass from the police? Think of them like feral cats. They're everywhere; you really should get rid of them, but when the cats are gone, the rats take over. So, given the choice, you'll take the cats over the rats. Think of the alternative. They're law-abiding criminals. "Law-abiding criminals." Yeah, well, on the other hand, you know, I've seen an angry drunk, but I've never seen an angry stoner. You know, half the world's problems would just melt away if everybody had a joint once in a while and, uh, just chilled the hell out. What are you, last of the hippies? You're a cop. Yeah, but I'm a sensible cop. Legalize it, tax it, and watch the country's financial problems just disappear like that. Then you'd have a new problem. The whole gateway thing. But not every crackhead started out with weed, and not every stoner progresses to crack. Yeah, well, talk to me when it's in your neighborhood, Mr. Love-In. I've never known dope to make a block better. It always makes it worse. And these dope slingers, they might be nice, but they're mopes.

Stay back? Stay back? Why don't you law-enforcing types do something useful for a change, like tell us what actually happened? Yeah, we want to know if Carl and Juanita are okay. When we know, you'll know. That's a bunch of same old, same old. You never tell us anything on this block. Can you see if there's anyone in that ambulance? I can't see anything. Carl! Juanita! Oh, there he is. Hey, hey, where you going? Come on. Come on. Look, we're all like family here on this block; would you hold us back if it was your family? Look, at least let my husband go. Larry's head of the block association. The rest of us can stay back here. All right, look, it looks like they're about to finish up over there. You could follow them to the hospital if you want, all right? I didn't see anyone around the weed house. Just the fireball. Have you figured out what it was? Yeah, yeah, it was a Molotov cocktail thrown at the back of the house. There you go. Glenwelg? Yep. You guys get any more specifics, let me know, okay? We'll be here a while. Okay, thanks, Detective. All right, I want you to take the complaint from the Morrells. They sustained injuries, so go to the hospital with them. But remember, you just take the 61. Let the detectives crack the case. All right, you're doing this for Yoda and to score points with the police commissioner. Yoda. Score points. You're doing this for the... I thought this was a friend of yours. More like a bad memory. Back in the day, we ran in the same circles. If I brought two girls to the club, he would bring three. If he bought a Bentley, I bought a Maybach. If my entourage had ten people in it, his had to have 20. I'm talking prima donna to the max. That would explain why he's late. Let's just go. Crackpot! Oh! My brother from another mother. What the what? Wow, look at you. Looks like you're doing good. Well, you know what they say... cream rises to the top, baby. This is my partner, Ahmad Khan. Oh, assalamu alaikum, brother. Wa alikum Asalaam. Yeah. Just like old times, right? Did Jackpot tell you how we used to tear the streets up back in the day? Yeah, he mentioned a little bit. Did he tell you about our game, "Trap-her, keep-her"? Jackpot Toney. Officer Jackpot Toney. Why, oh, why? Look, man, I made a good living here. So, you know, I'm giving back. Yeah, you lost all that baller money, huh? Hold up, my bad. Just remember, you're doing it for Yoda and to score points with the police commissioner. Yoda. Score points. My bad. That was my agent. He thought he saw something wrong. Saw? Oh, yeah, he's, uh... he's right over there. Wait, your agent is following us? Yeah, got to take care of his number one client, right? Mo' money, mo' problems, baby! Who would do this to us? Baby, it's gonna be okay. Carl, Juanita? Oh, hey, brother. Hey. Thanks for coming. Larry, it's so sweet of you to come. You know we're all pulling for you. What the hell happened? Do we know yet? Yeah, somebody blew up my house. NiNi got cut by the flying glass. What? Don't worry. The block takes care of it's own; you'll be all right. If you could excuse us, I have to speak to the Morrells. This bombing? This was bound to happen. And why is that? Because this is a drug war. Look, every couple of weekends this last year, the SpaHa Latins send a guy over to that corner on Adam Clayton Powell. Carl and them argue about SpaHas trying to divert his weed customers to SpaHa country. This last time, it got really heated. Violent? Not until tonight. The point is, you guys have been ignoring this situation. This has been a long time coming, and it's going to get a lot worse. Kenny. Thanks for coming. We called you because we didn't want to arrest him. What were you doing out? He was tagging a tombstone at the cemetery on 120th. Tagging? Yeah. MSC. Is he still running with that gang? You told me you were out. I am out. Then what were you doing tagging at a cemetery? Mom is gone, Grandma's sick, I'm working all the time. T, we don't have enough to deal with? And what if another officer had found you? I'd be bailing you out of jail right now. Wait for me at the door. How's everything else going? All right? We're hanging in there. I got a new job waitressing. Oh, I brought you something from the restaurant. It's just a little token of my thanks. And you'll let me know if there's anything I can do for you, right? Yeah, no, of course. You've been really great with T, helping him out in that gang fight. I appreciate all your help. Ooh, way to protect and serve there, Officer McLaren. What? Nothing. I just see why that kid merits the outreach. How's she doing? Better. The doctor says she'll have some scarring, but it could have been a lot worse. Do they know when she'll be released? They say I can take her out tomorrow, but I don't know where. I mean, half the parlor floor is ash and water. What about family? We are the family. Kids, grandkids. When they need help, they come to us. Oh, God, why is this happening? Why? Who, uh, would want to do this, do you think? I don't know. No enemies? No. What about your wife? No. Come on, think. I'm sure you'll come up with someone. We help out more people than the government. Maybe, uh, we should just get to this complaint report. Ah, here we are. Uh, place of business? I own a barbershop at 124th at Lenox and a Laundromat at 146th and St. Nick. What about the weed? Sorry? You sell weed out of your house, right? That'd be a place of business, too. Look, the police at the precinct don't say anything. They know I'm a good guy, a good neighbor. Mr. Morrell, we're not here for that. We're just here to take the report. Was it possibly gang-related? Do we look like we're in a gang to you? Rumor has it you've been having words with the SpaHa Latins. About them moving in on your turf. Rodrigo and Nate? They just kids playing at gangsters. Hell, most of them been in my chair since they were knee-high. W-Wait a minute. So you think they did this? Mr. Morrell, please, don't worry about this, okay? You just go in there, you take care of your wife. When we know something for certain, one of the detectives will be in touch with you, okay? Let me talk to you. What the hell are you doing? He knows who did the firebombing. He doesn't want to say 'cause he's a drug dealer. Hey, try and remember this, okay? They're the ones that got bombed. They're the victims, you understand? Let's go, you two. Who's staying with the prisoners? With the what? Why is everybody being so delicate with them? They sell dope. Look, you got your big problems, you got your little problems. The Morrells? They're a little problem. The guy who threw the bomb, that's a big problem. Police work at a busy precinct, it's about prioritizing. This is what gets our priority. I see it all the time. Kid, new to the neighborhood, doesn't know who to trust. Falls in with the wrong crowd. But he's a good kid, you know? Just needs someone looking out for him. It doesn't hurt that he has a hot sister. We're just friendly. How friendly is friendly? It's not like that. I mean, she's a banger's sister. How dumb would that be? So what? She's not banging herself, is she? She seems nice. Squared away. True. Gorgeous. Let me ask. Do you see chemistry between us? Ray Charles would see chemistry between you. ♪ I kick it, I kick it like Olindo ♪ ♪ I wear my Nike boots and Gucci, I don't wear no Timbo ♪ ♪ I kick it any tempo, I'm lifted off the indo... ♪ He all right over there by himself? He kind of stands out. Who, Barry? He got his ghetto pass a long time ago. He good. Yo, tell me about these footposts. We walk our footposts to stay connected with the community. Hey, Jackpot. Ladies. How are you? Good. How y'all doing tonight? Better now. And it's cool 'cause you get to really interact with the people. I mean, but yeah, but there's got to be more action than this, though, right? We're rookies. We mostly do complaints, write summons, sit on DOAs. Gentlemen, you guys should've gone into library science. Dana? Ahmad, hey. Jackpot. Hey, Dana, this is Lamont White. He's gonna be shadowing us for the week. Monsta White? One and the same. Cool. My little brother loves you. That's what's up. Uh, this is Wynton. We are just out having drinks. Wynton, these are all the guys I work with. How you doing? Hey. It's nice to meet you. Likewise. Catch you next week? Yeah, see you then. Good night, Ahmad. I smell a throw-down. I'm just saying, man. Two hours after the bombing, and already a lot of new faces on the block. You see that? With the weed house now gone, there's a hole in the ecosystem. Rats are gonna move in. They're gonna try to fill it. What is it with you vets - and rat metaphors? - Yeah, Sarge. I think I missed the memo on that one, too. We gonna collar them? One arrest isn't gonna fix that problem. They'll be back, but they won't be alone. What does that mean? It means, if there's a major move to take over the block, we could be looking at more bombs before the night's up. What do you think? Break-in? With all the lights on? Hello! What? You wait two hours after I close to show up? We're just checking to see if everything's okay. Yeah, it's not okay. Come. Come inside. This was today. What happens tomorrow, huh? What happened? These boys, they scare my business away. I phoned the police. That's why you're here, right? Sure. Absolutely. But now we need to know exactly what happened. These boys, they come in, they play around, they don't buy nothing, they make a mess, then they leave. I phoned the precinct the last few days. They say, "Ring us back when they commit a crime." What do you mean by "play around"? They play around, they play around. They play in the aisle, they play with the blood pressure cuff, they play by the door. Where are your surveillance monitors? It's here. See them? SpaHa Latins hanging out on the east side of the block. And on the west side, that kid right there, he's 13 Devils. What the hell is a gang from that far uptown doing scoping a neighborhood? Must be trying to move in, too. That guy there? The one on the right? That's Razor Hopkins. He's the big dog on that crew. Are you kidding me? Taking pictures of drug dealers? This guy's suicidal. I don't like this. Whole block's gonna be on edge all night. You take my picture one more time... You're on my block. You don't like it? Go back to your own block. Your block? You two stay here, guard the A and E detectives. Assist him if he asks. Where you going? I can't stop the dealing, but maybe I can stop everybody from killing each other before this whole thing settles down. Sir? Sir? Here, see? And this kid. This kid, he tells me he's sorry. Now, if he's so sorry, why does he keep coming back with the rest, huh? You know they're casing the joint, right? Checking all the doors, the locks. I know. We should tell Terry Howard. I want to talk to T-Rex first. He lied to me, and he lied to his sister. He's a kid. Lying is his job. Hey, do you think it'd be safer if you stayed with us? No, I'm good. It's the new Harlem, right? Obama, bistros, lattes. Look, you a white guy with a $2,500 suit, and it's 3:00 a.m. Monsta says I'll get in the way. You'll get in the way? Wow, that's rich. You got to be forceful with her. Tell her what you want. Tell her what to do. Take charge, yo. Do not listen to him, Ahmad. Just be yourself, man. You'll be fine. No, no, no. Don't listen to him. Look, you see this beauty right here? This here is wifey. You think I got her by being Laid Back Jack? No, no, no, no, no. The number one thing a woman wants is a take-charge type of man. It makes her feel safe. Like the dude with the glasses. He put his arms around your babe. He said it in big neon letters ten-feet high: "She's mine." So what do I do? Call her! Tell her what's up. Demand she go out with you. But if he's claiming her, it's too late. No, no, no, not necessarily, okay? Don't worry about drinks. Worry if he's staying for breakfast. Hey. Hey, can you help me out here? I've been looking for the owner of this car, and I can't find him. He's got me blocked in, and I really got to jet. What, what? So what are you gonna do? A magic trick. I'm gonna make the owner appear using a pen and a piece of paper. I got to see this one. See what I'm talking about? Right there. Okay. Hey, calm down. Yeah, yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm out of here, I'm out of here, I'm out of here. I'm out of here. I'm-I'm-I'm out of here. It's too late. I already started writing the ticket. Come on, man. I was just delivering medication to my mother. In the middle of the night? I was only up there five minutes. Your car is cold. Oh, snap! Monsta, that you? That you? Yo, dog, yo, these dudes with you? Yo, come on. You got to get them to cut a brother some slack. Let me see what I can do. Ah! Thanks. Thanks a lot, man. Hey, by the way, your joint, "NYPD, Not Yo' People, Dawg," gets mad replay in my car, son. Good looking, man. He really has a song called "NYPD, Not Yo' People Dawg?" Why you gotta harass the brother, man? Look, can't you cut him some slack? It's not like that's like a real crime anyway, know what I'm saying? Right? Right. You have a nice night. That's foul, man. Come on, how much is that ticket? I don't know, $150? Maybe $175? Hey. Hey, hey, yo, my dude. Come here for a second. Now it's a good night. Yo, Monsta, you the real thing, dawg. Thank you. Yo, you mind signing an autograph for my shortie? Yeah, where you want me to sign at? Central to 22, Post 41. Go for Post 41. 85 the training sergeant at 121 and Frederick Douglass. 10-4. Please let us be getting rid of his ass. Oh, we leaving? Hey, T! T! Oh, come on, T. Your sister just picked you up from the precinct, and you're out again? Screwdriver, crowbar? What's this? Tools for shop class. You got class at 3:00 in the morning? I just left them in there, is all. Do you think 'm stupid? Don't you know what'll happen to you hanging out with this gang? Did the gang do this? Just leave me alone. Let me help you, T. Yeah. You play all rightful big brother with me, but you just trying to get next to my sister. What's wrong with this kid? Can't he see I'm trying to help him? I don't know. He's got a point. Are you really trying to help him, or are you trying to help you? Looks like the burglary's going down tonight. Yeah. Let's find Terry Howard and tell him what we know. This situation is becoming a powder keg. I need you to keep everybody separated, all right? Keep the residents over there, everyone else over there. Dope crews are trying to fill the market volume at warp speed around here, so I need you two to be the scarecrows on this corner. Name of the game: keep the entire area clear. Can you handle that? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. All right. Call me on the radio if you need me. You mind if I stick close for a little while? You scared of the hood, man? No, of course not. I just... I get better cell service here. Oh, my God, there he is. I have all your CDs. Yeah? Can I get a picture? Who are all these people? Where'd they come from? I tweeted our location to some friends. Do these look like friends to you? Oh, damn! If it ain't Metal Mouth White. Remember me? Hey, I used to know this guy when he was wearing big-ass horn rims and more mouth metal than a robot. His mom used to call him, uh... Horace. Now he call himself Monsta. If you a monster, what that make me? End of the world? We need to keep this area clear. Back it up now. Hey, Horace, how's your mama now? She know you out this late? Come on, man, back it up. Down the street. Keep moving. Let's go. Ladies, no, no, turn around. All the way down. Move down. Shots fired! Shots fired! He's got the shooter! He's got the shooter! Shots fired. Carl! Carl's got a gun! Police! Get down on the ground! Don't hurt him! Police! Get down! You didn't do anything! Lay it down, Carl, before you get shot. Down! Down now! Carl, what did you do? What the hell happened? He was shooting at those SpaHas, and the gun blew up in his hand. They burnt down my home. Cut up my beautiful wife, and why? Over some damn weed? That's it. We got to clear these streets before somebody gets killed. All right. All right, come on. I want everyone off these streets in 30 minutes. You three, you take Adam Clayton Powell. You three take Frederick Douglass. The rest, sweep this block. Anyone that doesn't look right gets tossed. You get I.D. Anyone's got anything on them at all, anything at all, they get collared. I don't care if it doesn't hold up. Any of these people could be the firebomber, so be careful, all right? Let's do it. Hey, boss, where do you want us? Go back to your foot post, resume patrol. And take your circus with you. Firebombs, street sweeps... All this got to be in the movie. All right, let's go. All right, move it. Out of the street. Keep it moving. Let's go. Monsta, baby, I love you! Will you marry me? Come on. Keep moving. Tonight? Are you sure? He had these tools on him. They were all together on that video. All right, first, we hook up with Yoda, and we help him clear the streets around that weed house. Then we'll do a stakeout on the pharmacy. Maybe get a burglary collar tonight. You know T-Rex is going to be there. I know; talk about screwed. Show up, go down for a felony. Don't show up, be labeled a punk. In this neighborhood. Okay, we're gonna need everybody to go back to their homes. We're clearing these streets. Everyone off the block. Thank you. Finally! What do you want to do about them? I don't know what we can do. They're on private property. Hey, you guys, let's go, off the block. Bite it. Come here. He's clean. Come on. Everybody off the block! Beat it. Everyone home. What about you? You special? What am I doing wrong? This is public property. I ain't obstructing nothing. Ain't got no open container. You ain't got no reason to knock me off this block. Maybe I just don't like you. You can leave now, or we can arrest you for disorderly conduct. What you want to do? Come on. All right, let's go. Everybody inside. All you SpaHas are going to jail tonight. McLaren, what, are you asleep over there? McLaren, don't stare at the Skull Crackaz. They're gonna get cold feet. Leave them alone so we can bust them later. You, get up. What you want, Opie? How many times I got to tell you get off the streets and go home? Huh? And what's in here? Spray cans? I just busted you for spray cans earlier. That's it, you're done. You're under arrest for criminal possession of graffiti instruments. Get out of here. Go. What's up, shorties? The people seem to love him. Yeah, well, margarinets. Yo, Monsta, Monsta. Hey, I've been your boy since I was, like, a kid, man. Like, I emulate my style after you; take my CD. I can't accept unsolicited material, man. Oh, you got to, dude. Look... I got that new jam, blazing hit, dawg, I'm telling you. Listen. Yo, yo, I'm good. All right, man?

Yo, yo, Jackpot, Ahmad, arrest this cat, man. For what? For selling unauthorized copies of my copywritten work! Come on, man. He's just trying to get by; we don't want to harass him. Besides, we're saving all our energy for the real crimes. This is real crime. Y'all ain't gonna... All right, fine. But I'm taking my CDs. You leave my merchandise alone, man. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have no merchandise. What the hell is the matter with you, man? Come on, man! Do I come to your job causing fights? Look, let's just call it a night, all right? Let's get Barry. Let's just go. - I don't see him. - Me, neither. He probably went to the bathroom or something, man. Yo, what's up, money? Who this? "Who this?" Who is this? Yo, where the hell is my agent? Your agent? Your agent got problems. What? Hurry up. Hurry up. Police! Don't move! Hands up! Hands up! Up against the wall. Right there, don't move. Gun! Gun!

What are you doing? I got robbed. This got to be in the movie. What movie? Michelle... Excuse me. My brother was arrested last night by Officer McLaren. Man, what a night. Yeah, I can't believe it's finally quiet. I've never seen residents so dedicated to their block. Yeah, I don't blame them. I wouldn't want new drug dealers setting up here, either. They already blew up one drug house to make a point. What would happen if they were actually allowed to set up shop, you know? Are you going in so soon? Dew is setting in. Got to get home before that water gets my perm wet. I-I hear you. - What's going on, baby? - Hey. Hey! Hey! This is the last time I'm going to tell you to get off this block! Uh-oh. Check it. Shut your piehole, bitch. Say that again. I dare you! Say that again! You think I'm scared of you? Come here. Come here. Come here so I can whip your ass. Hey, hey! Come on! Yo. Over there. Over there. Let's go! Over there. Did you see that? Did you see what he did? Over there. Man, what...? Cross the street. Let's go. Cross the street! Relax. Go in. Let them sell drugs on the street in broad daylight? It doesn't make any sense! Relax, all right? Gonna relax? Yeah? Gonna relax? Yeah. All right. Doesn't... it just... it just... it's crazy. Why me? He's the one that doesn't belong here. I have a right to protect my property. I feel you, but you have to calm down. Have a lot of liquor here. Do you sell? Yeah, I-I... I did. Had a top-of-the-line shop on Lenox until last year. Glenwelg. 18-year single malt, limited to 2,000 bottles a year. One of which torched the Morrells' house. Put your hands on the wall. Sir. Everyone said Harlem was coming back. Everyone said Harlem was the place to be. And I said, "Put your hands on the wall." What they didn't say... what they didn't say was that Wall Street was going to take us to the cleaners and people would stop spending money. I spent two years traveling all over the UK searching for the best distilleries. And for what? Nobody wanted what I found. Nobody could afford it or give a damn. Nobody wanted to buy my single malts. But do you know what... what they could afford? Do you know what they did want to buy? They want to buy that weed. My business goes down the drain, and-and... and Carl is over there making money hand over fist. So you firebombed his house? I didn't want anyone to get hurt. I was just sitting in my kitchen... drinking, feeling sorry for myself. And then I finished the bottle, and I put the gas in it, and I stuck a dish towel in, and I lit it, and before I knew, I was walking across... and I threw it over Carl's fence. I didn't even know where it was going to land. I... I'm not a monster. Tell that to the Morrells. I know. You're right. They're really nice people. See, I just couldn't... I couldn't stand it anymore. I couldn't watch them sell that weed. It just wasn't fair. Well, whatever they did, they didn't deserve that. How'd it go? See for yourself. Little advice. Don't take the tagging collar and give up the burglary collar. You take the better collar for yourself. Aren't you just going to steal it later? That's a good one, kid. All right. Let's go-- all of you on one bench. You will be processed momentarily. She hates me. Did you tell her you arrested him to save him from a felony? If I do, the kid was right about me. I was just using him. Either I do it for him or not at all. So I did it for him. Maybe it's not hate. It's really early in the morning. Maybe it's exhaustion. No, that's hate. It's definitely hate. God, I dig her. Menacing. Obstruction of justice. Disorderly conduct. Can I just say... Zip it. Assault and battery, harassment, theft, robbery, kidnapping. You two are a walking crime wave. To be fair, some of that's not our fault. Oh, really? How do you explain a 30% spike in crime in one day? Fleet week? And who tweets his fans to come and meet him at an active crime scene? Actually, that-that was... that was my fault. You know what, you two? This shadow session is over, starting now. Call the commissioner-- tell him to find another precinct for you to wreck. What? No. Absolutely not. The police commissioner said I could have anything I wanted-- I want Jackpot. And, see, the nice thing about being me... is I have powers of persuasion. Oh, yeah? Well, I have powers of persuasion, too. Like with a certain probation officer in California whose ward wasn't supposed to leave the state. We understand each other? Come on, Barry. Let-let... let's just go. Who says East Coast and West Coast can't get along? Something Monsta said about you, I... can't get out of my head. What was that? Four women, one night? Thank God I grew up. T. You're good to go. What's going to happen to them? They committed a felony. Probably get jail time. You know, you could tell her what you did. What'd I do? You know, for me. Stay out of trouble. You'll get her next time. Think there will be a next time? Nah. Can you believe the girls are missing this? To the winner goes the spoils. Yeah, win the collar, spoil it with paperwork. You might want to slow down there, buddy, or you're going to choke. Uh-uh. I can't. I'm easing my pain with pancakes. What are you looking for? Uh, Dana. She's meeting us here. Look what she texted me. Wait. She invites you out for breakfast, and you tell her to come here, with four guys? Yes. Was this wrong? Yes! Yes! What should I have done? Hmm? Wow. You have a lot to learn about women. Hello, all. Oh, speaking of. What did I miss? Nothing. Nothing. We were just talking about sausage. Yeah, pancakes. What? Tell her how nice she looks. What? How are you? Sync & corrections by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com
