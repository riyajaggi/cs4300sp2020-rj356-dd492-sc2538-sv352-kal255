 Previously on NYC22... Last night at 02:00 we had an assault. The killer: shaved head, six-five, six-six, - shamrock tat on the throat. - I had him. I was in some hole-in-the-wall bar the other night. I froze. Yo, this our block. You can't tell us nothing, 'cause we didn't do nothing. Officer, he didn't mean no disrespect. My name is Michelle Terry.

 I'm T's sister. T, what are you doing? Who you here with? Nobody. Who wrote on that tombstone, nobody? Is he still running with that gang? You told me you were out. I am out. Then what were you doing tagging at a cemetery? She hates me. Did you tell her you arrested him to save him from a felony? Maybe it's not hate. No, that's hate. God, I dig her. All right, day tour, fall in for inspection. McLaren. Con.

 Here. Here. Post 46. Martini. Here. Hey, Ray. Good mor. Good morning. Let's roll. Toney. Perry. Here. Here. 45. Harper. Sanchez. Here. Here. Who's that? My dad. Post 47. Duke. McCormack. Hey, Inspector. What brings you uptown? Detective squad review. 22's clearance rate's a little low, Chief says. Wants me to give every open case, and detective, a thorough going-over. Oh. Something tells me it's not gonna be as romantic as it sounds. Where's your flashlight? You know, day tour. And your vest? Soon as I lose this next ten pounds, sir. I don't care if you're two tons of cop in a one-ton vest-- wear it. How's Junior doing? What, Kenny? He's, uh... he's a chip off the old McLaren block. Ride his tail. No special favors, or I'll ride yours. 10-4, Inspector. Anybody got an extra flashlight? Dad. Hey. I was hoping I'd catch your tour. This is my partner, Ahmad Khan. Deputy Inspector Dennis McLaren. Pleasure to meet you. Pleasure's mine. So, did you hear your brother's getting his gold shield? He made detective? No, nobody told me. That's great. Yeah, your mother wanted to be the one to tell you, but, uh, she left you a couple of messages. I've been meaning to call back. Listen, I got to, uh, be upstairs. I got a major case review. But, uh, call me when you go to meal. All right? I'll buy. And shine up those dogs before you hit the street, will you? My dad's a hard-ass, too. When I was ten, I asked him why I had to be Muslim. He slapped me so hard, I flew across the room. Told me to read the Koran. I did. But I also read the Bible. So Islam was my choice, not my father's or my grandfather's or his grandfather's. The McLarens only have one religion: NYPD. And our priest would agree. My dad... you know, he's great. Generous, never missed a ball game. He just wants the best for everyone in our family-- so long as he gets to decide what that is. 22, Post 46, 10-11 silent alarm activation. Possible 10-30 at Mendenhall Bank, 3910...

We got this side. You guys go. Cut through here. This way. I feel like a cat in an old cartoon waiting outside a moe hole. There he is! Post 47 in pursuit on West 121st and A.C. Powell!

Yes. Good. FBI's case. We just warm the sheets till they show up. Hey, where you want to have lunch? That little strip club under the bridge-- best meatballs in the city. Mr. Arnhauldt? You sure you're not injured? No, I'm fine. He threw you down pretty hard. I'm fine. Listen, are we gonna be here much longer? Because I run a nursing home, and we're getting audited by the state today, and I'm gonna have 67 bewildered elderly people getting poked and prodded and... generally have the breakfast scared out of them. And where's the nursing home located? Just around the corner... He handed me the note and a backpack. But you tripped the alarm anyway? And I took my time with the cash, hoping the cops would get here in time. They were fabulous. Fabulous is a big part of our training. So he didn't get any cash, huh? No. That man in the suit jumped in front of him, and the robber used him like a shield to get outside. Okay. Thanks. You're welcome. So, this witness, guy in the suit, tried to play hero. Yeah, we talked to him. Talked to him? Where is he? He works near here. We'll go pick him up. Okay. Detective Luster, you wanted to see us? We were first on the scene. Geez, I can't get away from McLarens today. Is this your first bank robbery? Hell of a start, huh? Who is it that, uh, your dad used to tell arrested Willie Sutton? Was that your grandfather? Great-grandfather. Need you to look at this. Male Hispanic. Five eight, buck-fifty, goatee. That's only what, like, a million guys in New York? Did you get a look at him without the glasses? Scar, tattoo? Anything? Afraid not. No, sorry. Well, he didn't get anything, so he'll probably try it again. We had a guy last year hit a bank, walked across the street, hit another one. We caught him trying a third. Asked him why. He said, "Well, the first two went well-- I figured I was having a good day." Well, we'll keep an eye out for him. Remember, he's got a gun. You okay? Yeah. Let's go. I'm good. You've been kind of out of it since before roll call. Out of it? What, are you kidding? I just chased a bank robber halfway across Harlem. You telling me your heart's not thumping a little harder? You stay out too late, Ray. What am I supposed to do? I mean, come on. Aren't you keyed up after tour-- I can't... I can't go home and just watch TV or whatever. If you got the secret to chill at will, you know, you let me know. Arnhauldt's not gonna be happy with us showing up during his audit. Yeah. - Yeah... - Get off me! Let go! Get... Hey, hey! You! Get against the wall! Hey, you okay? - What's going on? - It's nothing, nothing. It's a misunderstanding. Well, we can understand it at the precinct. The robbery closed my branch. I had to go use another one. He probably saw the teller counting out my cash. It was a fair amount. How much is a "fair amount"? Five thousand. My wife is a little neurotic, so... after the hurricane and then the earthquake, she heard on the news that you should have a month's expenses in cash on hand just in case of an emergency. That's kind of ironic, you preparing for an emergency and getting mugged in the process. Yeah, listen, I-I don't have time to press charges. I got to get back to work. I'm gonna need you to wait for a minute. Assault, assault, petty larceny, felony assault. What, are you homesick for Riker's, Terrance? It's all in the past, man. I don't do that no more. You don't? You were jacking the guy. I wasn't jacking the guy. He was trying to give me five K. What, you just won Publisher's Clearing House? He wanted me to kill somebody. A total stranger offers you $5,000 to kill somebody? Anybody in particular? Never got around to telling me. Okay, so how did that turn into a fight? Man, I ain't no hit man. But you show me an inch of money... Human nature shouldn't be a crime. Oh, now you're making me sleepy. Gonna get some coffee, for the two of us. Thanks. 10-13, 123rd and 5th! Come on, stay down, down! Johnny, I told you not to come back! Stay down, give me your hands! Give me your hands! Come on, let's go! Hey, you know who this is? Shannon Bar murder poster-- stomped some guy to death. We got him? No, I got him. Let's go. Let's go, Shamrock, come on. - Hey, you okay? I'll call EMS. - No, no. My collar-- I'm coming with him. Homicide suspect John Kelso. From the Shannon Bar stomping. Nice pinch, Harper. D-Cell One. Presidential Suite. Harper, just so you know, the detective squad is going to get the collar, but you will get credit for the apprehension. Credit-- wow, a five-percent tip. That's very generous. But Ray took him down. Well, blame 50 years of NYPD tradition. After EMS checks you out, get me your report and then stick around. Want you to help out with the lineup. What? The way he keeps staring at me. I mean, it's bad enough if he thinks I'm just some cop who arrested him, but what if he recognizes me from the bar and tells the other detectives that I choked, just let him walk away? He's a murderer-- who's going to believe him? Okay, so they don't. Then what? Then I'm living with a lie. I just-- I can't, I can't do it. You think you haven't been? Look, rookies are on a two-year probation period. He's a homicide suspect. I could lose my job for failing to take police action. Well, we both could 'cause I've been keeping your secret, too. Look, Kelso has laid eyes on a lot of people since the murder. You're just another ugly face in the crowd. We released Arnhauldt, but thinking about how agitated - and emotional he was... - I'd be agitated and emotional, too, if I went from being in a bank robbery to getting mugged. Or if you were a straight-up citizen trying to hire a hit man off the street. Come on. "I mugged him because he wanted me to kill somebody" is right next to "He mugged me, and I was trying to get my money back." We charge Wilson with the robbery and be done with it. Maybe Detective Luster was right. We take the robbery-assault collar and call it a day. I'm not saying Terrance Wilson was telling the truth about murder for hire, but there's definitely something off about Arnhauldt. Here it is. Disorderly conduct about a month ago. Complainant's a woman named Joy Peoples, age 30. Incident in her apartment on 138th Street. And there's about half a dozen parking tickets on that same block going back over two years. Arnhauldt lives in Queens. His nursing home's about a mile south of 138th, so what's he doing up there in Joy Peoples' apartment? She's his side piece. She's half his age. What, you wouldn't go for a guy twice your age? Not if he was married. Oh, yeah, right, your "alleged" fiancé-- I mean, he's a rule maker, not rule breaker. He's an ADA-- that's a rule enforcer. I mean, he does exist, right? Because you don't show pictures, he never comes by. I'm just saying, I think you made him up so people don't hit on you. Just you. Joy Peoples called the cops because Arnhauldt got rough. You think maybe he was trying to hire somebody to finish the job? You want to take it to Luster? After the way he patted us on the head the last time? Let's talk to his side piece first. Won't be a huge party. Eddie only made detective, not chief. Keg, couple handles in the rec room. Usual eats, usual crowd. You stay over. Your mother keeps your room same as when you left it. I thought she was gonna turn it into a study for herself. Eh, think she's waiting till you get a wife. You know, she gets worried when she calls and all she gets is your voice mail. You know, I'm sorry, it's just, these first couple months-- it's like one tour starts before the last one ended. So it's not because you're out every night with this girl-- the one with the brother in the gang? What, you mean Michelle? I arrested her little brother for tagging. Listen to me. Her banger brother shoots somebody while you and her are going at it-- are you kidding me? That kid is not a banger, and I'm not even going out with her. I haven't. Good. Is this why you came today-- to tell me all this? My job is a lot bigger than monitoring your love life. Well, that's a relief. That's what you call postmortem bruising. That's from the aggressive application of your foot on his neck on the sidewalk outside the Shannon Bar. I never been to New York until today. And you got your girlfriend-- who's never been out of the city-- pregnant how? Or maybe it's not your kid. It's okay. I don't need you to talk. No deals to be made here. But getting that big, stupid tattoo on your neck wasn't too brightful. It helped eyewitnesses describe you and confirm sightings of you in town the day after-- multiple sightings. What was that about? He was just asking me if we got hurt in the fight. That's all? You're saying I'm lying to you? I, I don't know what you're doing. Ray, you better get a grip. Remember that this is on both of us? Oh, yeah. You put me in this position and you're not making it better by accusing me of doing things I didn't do. Hey. You still mad at me? Actually, I-I owe you an apology, but I didn't know how to make it. T told me what you really did-- arresting him for graffiti so he didn't get caught up in guns and burglary. I haven't seen him hanging with a gang since the charges were dropped. I wanted to call and-and say thank you, but I didn't know if it'd be right. Call me anytime you want. Thanks. And you, too. Hi. Dennis McLaren. Michelle, my dad. Oh! So, you're Michelle. Kenny's told me a lot about you, but I didn't believe a word of it. Nice to meet you. And you. I'm giving Kenny a ride back to his post. I'm gonna walk it. It's just a couple blocks. Oh. Can I give you a ride? Uh, thanks, but I've got more errands. Well, then, good to see you, kiddo. Don't forget to call your mother. Geoff was just here. Did he hurt you? Of course not. Wait. You mean, last month? That was a mistake. Geoff said he was gonna break up with me after eight years, and I... He broke up with you because he's married? That's what he said. And I feel bad for her, but Geoff and me, we just can't live without each other. He came back the very next night and every day since, and it's been wonderful. You don't look like everything's wonderful. You want to tell us what happened? He was, like, in a hurry. And he said, "Always remember I loved you." And then, "Good-bye." It was the "Always remember", it was so final. And then I looked out the window, and there was this guy with a shaved head waiting for him. And he put his arm around Geoff's shoulders, and they walked off together, but not like friends. More like... I've got a very bad feeling. Bank robbery's going down, and Arnhauldt throws himself in the line of fire. Wilson says he's walking around with five grand, trying to hire a hit man off the street. Yeah, Wilson says. He leaves his girlfriend and walks off with some scary guy. What if he's trying to get himself killed? Over a girlfriend? You want out, you don't want to hurt anybody. You're unstable, wearing your emotions on your fingernails. I think we got to find Arnhauldt before he and this scary guy get down to business. Okay, where do you want to start? In the 22, we have a 10-10, shots fired, 1500 block, Malcolm X. Available units respond. 22, Post 45, we're right around the corner. Show us responding. Police! Police! I saw it! I saw it! I saw everything. Saw what? I come out to do my bad habit, and I hear shouting, like two men's fighting, and then a gun goes off. A white man runs up out of that stairwell and down the boulevard. Then a brother comes out like he's looking for the white guy, but he don't see him, and he runs off the other direction. Which one got shot? No, I don't know. Which one had the gun? I don't know. It could have been either one. Sounds like Arnhauldt. Couldn't have gone far. Thanks. Thank you. There. There he is. Unstable man in a crowded subway, possibly armed. Central, show 45 going to the hole at 135 on the One. There he is. Stand clear of the closing doors, please. Mr. Arnhauldt. Are you injured? I'm okay, I'm fine. We spoke to Joy. Oh, God. Eyewitnesses from the Shannon Bar are here. We should get Kelso in the lineup. Here, put this over his tattoo. Mascis doesn't want the I.D. to look rigged. Fillers are wearing them, too. All right, Curly, show time. Get up. Hold still. Got to cover up your beauty mark. Don't think I don't remember you. Turn around. Pick a number. He remembers. I'm screwed. Hey, boss. Hey. I heard the, uh, lineup was a home run. Yeah, well, you know, it's hard to forget a face like that. Something else? Yeah, um... Uh, do...? Yeah. I, uh... I saw that face before... myself. At a bar... in the bathroom. I went in, and, uh... he-he was there. When? Night after the murder. What did you do? I had my gun. But I was, um... I don't know, you know, I just-just fr... I just froze. I was a little drunk, okay? I mean, it's not okay, but I was. And, you know, I should've called it in. I know, I mean, that's the least I should've done, but I-I... I didn't, and now this guy recognizes me... and he says he's gonna tell. And you're just telling me about this now? Who else was in the bathroom with you? Nobody. Look, you want me to resign, I'll-I'll do it, okay? I screwed up. Shut up. Let me wrap my head around this. First off, you're not resigning. Against all my expectations you're actually turning out to be a decent cop. Okay? Say nothing to anyone. Stay away from Kelso. Let's see how this plays out. What if he says something? Then we'll deal with that. Now, get the hell away from me. The first time Joy came to visit her grandmother at the home there was something there. I know it sounds ridiculous with the age difference. She's so beautiful. We both felt it. We'd sit together long after visiting hours just... talking about everything. Or nothing. And one night I kissed her. And she kissed back. I was done for. When her grandmother died, I paid for the funeral. But I had been paying for the rent and bills and vacations. We saw the photos. I ran through every dime I ever saved. And now I'm broke. My wife doesn't know yet. 26 years we've been together. I got two kids... that I love more than life itself. And so you ask why, why would I do this. But I can't live without Joy... and it's tearing me apart. And I only saw one way out, so... you know, I had to make things right. You couldn't kill yourself because your life insurance wouldn't pay out to your family, so you had to hire somebody - to do it for you. - And when that bank robber didn't shoot you, you tried Wilson. But he just tried to keep the cash. I come out of the restaurant, and totally by accident, Michelle comes walking down the sidewalk. You really think she didn't know you were there? Never occurred to me. And I'm the one who doesn't understand women? There was a spark, a definite spark, and then Dad killed it, which wasn't an accident. You know, wherever you want it to go with Michelle, it's your choice, not his. Easy to say. Same guy who got away this morning. Coming out of another bank? Stop! Police! Show 46 in pursuit! Watch out! 10-85 bank robbery suspect in bridal shop, 131 and Morningside. Send backup. Everybody stand back. Where's the guy who just ran in here? Nobody saw anything? I told him no dye pack! You've been robbing banks with a harmonica? After you arrest him, Wilson, I knew, did a lot of time. I looked all over Harlem. Finally I found this guy, Sammy Lane, who I had fired six months earlier for drugs. Bumped into him on Malcolm X. The funny thing is, when I was... you know, when it was gonna happen, okay, I'm looking down at the gun... I didn't want to die. I told him, no, I... I changed my mind. But he knew I had the cash. Sir... you're shot. I'm okay. I don't know, but I was pushing him away, and... he pulled the trigger. Why didn't you just give him the money? I borrowed it on the last good credit card I had. I had nothing left. I just want to go home. I just want to go home, I want to tell my wife everything-- everything-- I just want to... I'm tired of lying, and... Somebody pulled the emergency brake. Hell of a coincidence. Ladies and gentlemen, we're experiencing a momentary delay. Please be patient. We'll be moving shortly. Going back to check on the brakes. Arnhauldt... what's this Sammy look like? He's a black guy. He's bald. He's got a leather jacket, and, like, he's got scar behind his ear. He's coming this way. I think he's the one that pulled the brake. Must've seen Arnhauldt get on the train. - And not us. - Officer? Yeah? He's got my gun. He wants to finish the job. 22, requesting backup. Do you copy? 22? Won't work down here. And we're not on Transit's frequency. You okay? Yeah, I'm okay, yeah. I think the bleeding just stopped. Sit tight. Everybody, I want you to just stay in your seats, remain calm, don't try and exit the car. We're gonna try and get it moving as soon as possible. Hey, hey, that's... Down! Down! Give me your gun! Give me your gun! On the ground now! Get on the ground! Release the gun! Release the gun! Turn around! Let go of the gun! Release the gun! Got it! Turn around. Turn around! Cuffs! What's going on here? Emergency's over. Radio for a police car and an ambulance to meet us at the next station. You just had your last subway ride for a long time. Come here. Get up. Nice look. Dye pack. Thanks to him. Enrique Garcia. Bank robbery, attempted bank robbery, resisting arrest, felony assault. Nice collar. Good work. Oh, hey, boss, this stuff washes off, right? No. Officers, Miss Garcia here wants to talk to you two. Why? Tell me why. Well, he robbed a bank and then tried to rob another one. No, no. Why he does he do it? Why is he so stupid? I could kill him. This was my Quinceañera. You know what that is? It's when a girl turns 15, and her father gives her away to womanhood. A big party, beautiful old-fashioned gowns and music. It means so much to me, because that stupid man, my father... Mija... he was never around when I was growing up, because he was in prison for bank robbery. He gets out last month and wants to make it up to me. Pay for the gowns, a DJ, food, a limo. And how? He robs a bank. It's because I love you. You know that's wrong. You know that takes you away from our family. So why does he keep doing it? Well, there was a guy named Willie Sutton. And nobody understood why he kept robbing banks, because he'd often get caught. And when they asked him why'd he keep doing it? He said, "Because that's where the money is." That doesn't explain crap. I hope you rot in jail! Does everybody in your family know so much about Willie Sutton? If I never hear that name again, it'll be too soon. Meet you at the house. Thanks. Geoff Arnhauldt... he's in the next car. You know we might have to charge him with soliciting murder, and filing false police report. Poor guy needs a shrink more than a cell. Okay, like, is this train gonna keep moving, or what's going on? How far does he think he's gonna get? He's wounded, and we know where he lives. Hey. I, um... told Yoda. You tell him that I knew? No. No, no. No, no. This is all on me. Look, uh... I'm really sorry. Keeping a secret, it just, uh... ...it just really eats you up, you know? I know. Both of us. So, um... tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah, tomorrow. Hey, Kelso. I talked to your girlfriend. She says that you stayed with her the night after the murder. So? So you say anything about any of my cops having seen you before, she's arrested for harboring a fugitive. And your daughter gets taken by the ACS. We understand each other? Yeah. Yeah, what? We understand each other. Doesn't change a thing. You know that your cop is a punk. What I know is, my cop took you down today. Don't ever lie to me again. I didn't. The hell you didn't. I never went out with Michelle. Anybody can see the two of you are a couple. We're not. I mean, I am attracted to her, but I'm not seeing her. Don't forget. You're a cop now. Now? The badge was engraved before the christening. Did I ever-- ever-- say, "Kenny, you have to be a cop"? Did I ever say that I wouldn't be proud of you if you weren't a cop? You didn't have to. Did I ever say it? Did I ever tell you, "You don't have a choice"? Did you ever tell me I did? I became a cop because my father, my uncles, our grandfather, his brother... they were great men. And I wanted to be like them. I was hoping that's why you did it, too. Hey, did you hear I caught a bank robber today? I'll let them know. Thanks. That was 108 squad. They're at your guy Arnhauldt's house. Went to pick him up, ended up arresting his wife instead. His wife? Yeah. Apparently he came home, told her he was having an affair, and she freaked. Killed him with a steak knife. Lazarus. I spoke to Kelso. I don't think he's gonna give you away. Thank you. I don't want your thanks. I want you to get it together. So where are you going now? You going home? You know, I have no idea why you wanted to become a rookie cop at this point in your life. I don't know. You know, I guess I just felt like... Doesn't matter. What matters is that you see that you're about to lose it. Sarge, I... look, I know. I froze, but it was, I... I'm not talking about Kelso. Chalk it up to a rookie mistake. You have got a problem. And you have to deal with it. You know, it's such a cliché. The old-timer with a bottle in his locker. Sarge, I don't have a bottle in my locker. Well, you haven't been around long enough yet. But you've seen the guys that have. And I saw how they got there. Find a meeting. Make this morning the last time you show up for roll call with a headache.
