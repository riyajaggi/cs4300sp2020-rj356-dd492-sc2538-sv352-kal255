 [cheering and applause]
 Thank you.
 Um, if there's one thing that
we as a band want to deal with,
 it's the issues.
 Like--
 That's just one
of the things.
  Yeah.
 Like the future
of the planet,
 um, the future of my children
 and my children's children
 and my children's
children's children, you know.
 Actually, Bret,
 when I think
about your children
 and your children's children,
 I actually think
your children are too young
 to be having children.
 And as far as your children's
children's children,
 I where does it stop?
 think, you know,
 When the children
are having children,
 you know, it's just,
how small are they gonna get?
 Too small.
 Too small.
 Too small.
 Exactly.
 That's one of the issues.
 Um, and, um...
 It's just gonna get
 into this ridiculous Russian
doll situation, isn't it?
 Yeah.
 Have you met my kids?
 Have you met
their little kids?
 And it's just gonna be...
 [laughter]
 Well, i
 s, Bret,
 I think your children
aren't gonna be affected
 by a lot of things
that affect other children,
 because your children
aren't real.
 [laughter]
 Yeah, yeah, okay.
 Do you see
the distinction between--
 Yeah, sure, but they still
will have issues
 that don't
get taken seriously.
  Um, and they--
 they have to deal
with all the imaginary stuff
 like rogue unicorns,
for example, you know?
 ayOk, sure, there's lots of
stuff I haven't thought about,
 I guess; I'm sorry.
 My wife and I weren't able
to have children.
 That's why we chose
to imagine them.
 The doctor suggested it,
 and, um, it's actually been
incredibly rewarding, you know.
 Bret's wife, um,
is unable to have children,
 because she's not
a real woman.
 No, she's--
 Yeah, she's imaginary,
yeah.
 And, uh, the--
 the kids take after her
in that sense,
 but she is--
 she's very beautiful.
 She is a very beautiful woman.
 She's a very beautiful woman.
 A much--she's a much better
kind of woman
 than some of the women
that I've...imagedin.
 Yeah.
 Um, but this song is more
about the real-world issues
 that are affecting us,
 everyone today.
 It's called Think about It,
  Think, Think about It.

 Um, there was a bit
in that song
 where we're dealing
with the, um, issue of AIDS
 in there--
 the bit
with the, um, monkeys.
 Yeah, because, um,
 it is believed that AIDS
was originally contracted
 from, uh, the monkeys--
 uh, not the band
but the animal.
 And we just wanted
to deal with that issue,
 just a couple of points,
 just change an attitude
towards AIDS
 from being, "Ooh, AIDS-y"
 to more like, "Ah,
fun monkey disease"
 type of thing.
 And also, it's just
to stop people
 from touching monkeys,
I suppose,
 'cause look what happens.
 Yeah.
 Mmm, okay.

 We'll do another song.

 And so all of the villagers
 chased Albee
the racist dragon
 into a very cold,
very scary cave.
 And it was so cold
and so scary in there
 that Albee began to cry
dragon tears,
 which as we all know
turned into jelly beans.
 [laughter]
 Anyway, at that moment,
 he
 but the badly burnthand
Albanian boy
 from the day before.
 [laughter]
 "What are you doing here?
 I thought I killed you
yesterday,"
 grumbled Albee
quite racistly.
 [laughter]
 [in squeaky voice]
"No, Albee.
 "You didn't kill me
with your dragon flames.
 "I crawled to safety,
 but you did leave me
very badly disfigured,"
 laughed the boy.
 [laughter]
 "Why are you crying so?"
 "I'm crying because all
of those horrible villagers
 "chased me
into the scary cave.
 "I think it's
because I'som racist.
 "Get your hand off my tail;
 you'll make it dirty."

 "No, Albee.

 "They chased me here too
 "when I became
all disfigured like this.
 "They just
don't like you and I,
 "because....
 well, because we're different
to them."
 And that made Albee cry
a single tear
 which turned
into a jelly bean
 all the colors
of the rainbow.
 And suddenly,
he wasn't racist anymore.
