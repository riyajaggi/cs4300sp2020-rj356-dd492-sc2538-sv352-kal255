 Check out this issue of Bearsky and Hatch. It's all about Morse code. I love codes. How's it work? Every letter gets a set of dots and dashes. I've got it memorized. You can use radios or flashlights or even write it down. Dee dee dee, dah dah dee. Oh! If I learn it, we can send messages to each other in code! That sounds great. Here.

 We're back! How was picking thimbleberries? Millie's the thimbleberry expert. We picked every last one in Acorn Springs. We definitely have enough for a big thimbleberry casserole. Show 'em, Rumy. Oh. I just ate one and then another and... You ate them all? Um, yeah. I'm so sorry. That's okay. If I had to carry the bucket back here, I would've eaten them, too. Those were all the thimbleberries we could find, and if they're gone,

 Millie can't make her casserole. It's okay. There have to be more. We just need to find them. It sounds like we've got a case. Will you excuse us? To the treehouse! I'm sure there are more thimbleberries out there, but where? That's what we have to figure out, or there's gonna be no casserole. There's a lot at stake. There always is, little brother. There always is. Let's do this. Let's ace this case! What makes you think there are thimbleberries in Granite Gorge? Plants need water to grow, and there's a creek that runs through Granite Gorge, so if there's water and sunlight and dirt... There might be thimbleberries? It's like magic, and I love magic. And I love thimbleberries. Let's get hiking. So should we cross the bridge or go up the creek? The thimbleberries could be anywhere. We should check both sides. Do we have enough time? It's getting pretty late. If we split up, we can check both sides at once. Great thinking, Toby. Bean and Jay, will you go with Toby? Millie, Rumy, and I will head up this way. If you find something, wave your arms like this so we'll see you. Ha! Can you see me?! Yeah! That's perfect. Nailed it. Good luck, you guys! If you find any thimbleberries, be sure and wave! Let's follow the facts. We've got water. What else do thimbleberries need? Teri said they need dirt to grow, That's a rock. So is that. So is that one. If we use the clues, we gotta go to where the dirt is. Up there! By those trees. Up here? Hey, Toby! Come see! Fireflies. Hi, guys! Why do they light up like that? I think that's how they talk to each other. Hey! They're following me. I guess they want to help us look for the thimbleberries. Let's go, guys. It's getting really dark. Are we going the right direction? Yeah, which way should we go? Let's ask our thimbleberry expert. We have a thimbleberry expert? Yeah! You know more about thimbleberries than anyone else I know. You're right! Let's see. Unlike raspberries, the thimbleberry, or Rubus parviflorus is not a true berry. Oh, and the roots are good for tummy aches. What else? How about your secret trick to finding them? Well, I always spin three times for luck, then find a shady place above the trail, near water. Those are all great clues. Let's get spinning! Sure. Why not? Oh, wow! Fireflies! Thanks! With you guys around, I don't need my flashlight. So we're looking for a shady place near water. Look! There's a waterfall right up ahead! Come on! This way! -Wow. -Ooh. Look at all those thimbleberries! Right where you said they'd be, in the shade near water. Nice job, Millie! Uh, Teri, we don't have a ladder, and it's too steep to climb. We need Jay. He could fly with our bucket and get all the thimbleberries we need. Oh, but Jay's across the canyon with Toby and Bean. Maybe if we wave like Toby said. -Hey! over here! -Hey, Toby! -Over here! Yah-ho! -Toby! They can't see us. It's too dark. Can the fireflies help? I think they're too small. Wait! Rumy, you just figured it out. I did? Wow. Fireflies use their light to communicate with each other, so we're gonna do the same. Would you hold this where I can see it? Thank you. How is reading a comic book gonna get Toby's attention? We're gonna use Morse code. Okay, Toby, let's hope you know what I'm doing. Let's see. Found... thimbleberries Need Jay. Toby, look! Is that a firefly? No! It's Teri! She's using Morse code, just like Bearsky and Hatch! They found thimbleberries, and they need Jay to collect them. Wow! You know Morse code? It's what detectives do if they read comic books. Okay, Jay, are you ready? I've never been more ready. Oh, and you better take our bucket for the berries. I'm on it. Here I go! O-Or not. I-It's really dark out there. I don't know if I can get across. Hey, thanks, guys. That's much better! Okay. Here I go! We'll meet you guys at the bridge! Teri, look! It's Jay! -Hooray! -Good job, Jay. Yay! Toby knew you were sending code. It said send Jay. He sent Jay. I mean me. The extra bucket was Bean's idea. We're going to need it and you. There's a bunch of thimbleberries! But they're way up where only you can get them. Wow. Thanks, fireflies. Okay, Jay. Okay, here I go! Huh? Huh? Oh, no. What happened? Our lantern ran out of batteries. That's okay. We've got lots of light. Wow. Wow. Thanks. You guys are the best. Say, "Fireflies"! Fireflies! Mmm. Morse code is a great way to send messages. Yup. Bearsky and Hatch helped us ace this case. And so did those fireflies. Everyone earned their thimbleberries on this one. Time to close this case. The Case of the Bountiful Berries is officially closed. There's Butterfly Grove! Look! It's going to be filled with butterflies, right, Millie? Absolutely. Every year on this day, millions of beautiful butterflies come to the grove. It's my absolutely favorite day, I can't wait to see them. They're so colorful. I love how they flit and flutter. I love how their little wings tickle my toes. And I love how many great pictures I always get. And now for the very best part... that first time you step into the grove and find yourself surrounded by... butterflies? -Huh? -Huh? This is Butterfly Grove, right? It is. But today's the day. This was the day last year and the year before. Butterfly Grove should be full of butterflies, -but it's not! -Did they take a wrong turn? I do that sometimes. You forget if you go right or left. Before you know it, you're lost. Oh, or maybe they found someplace they like better. How could butterflies like some place better than Butterfly Grove? There's no way they went anywhere else. They love the grove, and so do we. Toby and Teri, you have to find our missing butterflies. Please! Sounds like we've got a case. Will you excuse us? To the treehouse! The butterflies come to Butterfly Grove every year. And everyone loves it when they do. We just gotta find out what happened to them. There's a lot at stake. There always is, little brother. There always is. Let's do this. Let's ace this case! Jay, dust those treetops. Bean, leave no leaf unraked. What are you guys doing? I figured out why the butterflies are staying away. Look at this meadow. It's filthy. We're giving the meadow a makeover. When we're done, every butterfly in the world is going to wish they lived here. Everybody, come quick! There's some squirmy, wormy thing over here! Caterpillars. And there are, like, a million! They're gonna scare away the butterflies. This is terrible. Don't worry, Millie. We'll put 'em in these boxes. If we put in some leaves and stuff, they'll be fine for now. Okay, let's do it! Let's get these caterpillars a new home away from here so we can make room for our butterflies! We've got a million caterpillars, but where are all the butterflies? I don't know, Millie, but we'll find them. We'll check everywhere. If they come to the grove every year... Someone will know where they come from. Great idea, Toby. We'll trace the butterflies' steps. Time to ask some questions. Hi, guys. I just love doing that. So what brings you to the north side of Butterfly Grove? We're looking for the butterflies. Have you ever seen them pass through here on the way to Butterfly Grove? No, never. North side of the forest, never seen butterflies. Okay, what now? Now we go west. Thank you for your help. Anytime. Bye! No, I've never seen butterflies on the west side of Butterfly Grove ever. I got gnats, but that's it. Wow, so they don't come from the west either. Okay. Thanks! No, Bob! That log goes on top! Sorry. I don't know how the butterflies get into Butterfly Grove, but they don't come this way ever. That's it, Barry! Looking great! No butterflies to the South ever. If you're going east, talk to the killdeer. She's got her beak in everything that happens on that side of Butterfly Grove. We'll do that. Thanks! I thought you were here about the mockingbirds. Oh, noisiest birds you've ever heard, squawking all night! That sounds noisy. We really need to know about the butterflies. Have you seen them flying through this side of the grove? No, and if they'd ever come this way, I'd know all about it. I know everything that happens around here. Okay. Thanks. We walked a whole circle around Butterfly Grove. No one's ever seen butterflies fly into the grove, so how do they get there? Maybe they dig tunnels or they sneak in. Let's go back to the grove, make sure there isn't something we missed. I don't see any tunnels. Have you found any footprints? No, but look at this. I followed a caterpillar's trail, and this is where it ended. Have you guys seen this before? Millie! Toby found another one of those pod thingies! You've seen more of these? Yes! Come on. We'll show you. Remember the boxes we put the caterpillars in? When we went back to check them, the caterpillars were gone. And the boxes were full of those things! This case just got more interesting. Yes. Now the caterpillars are missing, too. -So do you know what they are? -Evidence. Lets go back to the treehouse and see if we can't crack this case. So Millie and everyone put all the caterpillars into boxes. And when they checked on them, the caterpillars were gone, and the boxes were filled with these pods. So if we use the clues, it seems like these pods might be our missing caterpillars. Or maybe the caterpillars are inside them. I bet you're right. It's called a chrysalis. It's a hard shell caterpillars make so they have a safe place-- To change into butterflies! That's why no one's ever seen butterflies going into Butterfly Grove. 'Cause they were there all the time, disguised as caterpillars. Just as I thought. Oh, no! All the chrysalises are in boxes! We better hurry and get them out before the butterflies hatch! Come on! It's called a chrysalis. It's like a cocoon. That's so amazing. That was a caterpillar? When it went in, but when it comes out, there's gonna be a butterfly. So we need to open those boxes. Where'd they go?! Rumy and Bean just took them away. Oh, no. We just took all the butterflies out of Butterfly Grove! We've gotta get those boxes back, and fast! -Come on. -This way! We sure did a great job cleaning the grove. When word gets out, I bet butterflies come from everywhere. Rumy, Bean, stop! We're too late. Too late for what? Those boxes are full of butterflies! Toby, can you and Jay get those butterflies back safely? Sure! Let's play follow the leader! Come on, guys! Yeah! Follow us! We need to get these boxes back to the Grove, and quick, and keep them closed. -Yeah. -You got it. -Come on! -Hurry, guys! Do we have them all? We do now. Okay. Then, everybody... open your boxes! Welcome to the newly improved Butterfly Grove! Oh, don't you love how clean it is? Come on! I'll show you around! I'm so happy. Our butterflies are back! Look at them all! Thanks, Toby and Teri. Whee! -Whoa! -Whoa! Look at 'em. Say, "Butterflies"! Butterflies. I never would have guessed that crawly little caterpillars could turn into beautiful butterflies. When you follow the facts, they can lead you to amazing discoveries. Time to close this case. The Case of the Colorful Caterpillars is officially closed.
