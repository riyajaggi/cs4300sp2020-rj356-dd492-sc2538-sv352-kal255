 That's him! He's coming! Commodore Barry! The greatest living bear explorer and our good friend. Welcome back to... Hello! Oh, sorry. We thought you were our friend. Would you like a cookie? Oh, thanks, but I'm all set. Huh? Should we be worried?

 No! If Commodore Barry said he'll be here, he'll be here. Like when he climbed the glacier. Exactly. The Commodore climbed a mile of ice in a blizzard, and he made it to the top on time. And then there was the time he paddled 4,345 miles up the Amazon and arrived just in time for tea. And look! Commodore Barry came all the way from Kathmandu just to have breakfast with us. And he showed up right when he said he would. Wow! He's gigantic! When the Commodore says he'll be somewhere, he will always arrive exactly when he said he would.

 -And now he's an hour late. -Mm-hmm. -Hmm? -He must be in trouble. You're right. Is he lost? But he's the world's greatest explorer. If the world's greatest explorer is lost, who finds him? -We do, Jay. -Mm-hmm. We have to. Sounds like we've got a case. Will you excuse us? To the treehouse! The Commodore could be anywhere. We're going to have to be more than just detectives. We need to be explorers. There's a lot at stake. There always is, little brother. There always is. Let's do this. Let's ace this case! I got some of Commodore Barry's explorer books from the library. You think they'll help find him? Absolutely. There's Climbing the Cliffs of the Karakorum, Spelunking the Caverns of Hang Son Doong, and Bushwhacking in the Hindu Kush. We'll start with this one. Then let's get bushwhacking. Okay! What does that mean? Spread out, move slowly, and look for something that looks like it belongs to a great big bear. Look! An acorn! I don't think Commodore Barry left that there. Neither do I. It just looks so yummy. Toby! Teri! We found something! Is it the Commodore's? Yeah! It's from his jacket. Then Commodore Barry came this way. Where did you find the patch, Jay? Over here. I should take a picture. But where do we go now? Commodore Barry loves adventure. Like-- Like spelunking in the caverns of Hang Son Doong? We're right near a cavern. Then I bet that's where he went. Come on! Footprints! And look how big! No one in Acorn Springs wears boots that large. Except our friend Commodore Barry. So if we follow the facts... He must have gone that way. -Then so will we. -Let me take a picture first. We might want it later. Where are we? Really far from home. I hope we don't get lost. We won't, because I'm going to drop pieces of this cookie as we head down the trail. So when it's time to go home, we'll just follow the crumbs. Ooh. Mmm. Yum. Uh, it doesn't really work if you eat the crumbs I drop. I'm sorry. It's okay. There's another way. Here you go, Rumy. Oh. Oh, thanks. Mmm. Commodore Barry taught me an old bear trick. When bears move through the forest, they mark trees along the way. That way, they always know where they've been. Big bears use their claws, but I'm gonna use a piece of chalk. Good thinking, Toby And now we have a trail for when we head home that's not so yummy. He could have gone any of these directions. What do we do? We follow the facts. Let's use the clues we've got. The Commodore lost that patch in the tree, and he left footprints in the cavern. -What else is there? -Wait! Look! There are lines in this picture. Let me see that. Remember when I said the Commodore makes marks on the trees? That's them! Toby's right. Look. Bears in the forest do it all the time. The marks look just like the ones in our pictures. But if he's leaving a trail, where is it? I don't see any scratches like that around here. That's because we're not looking high enough. Remember? Commodore Barry is big. So we need to look... up there! Great job, Toby. Ahoy there! Ohh. I must be getting hungry. I don't think your stomach talks. It's the Commodore. Come on! Commodore Barry, are you okay? Oh, I'm fine, just stuck. I was picking thimbleberries to bring to the party. I leaned on this old tree. It came down... on me! Don't worry. We'll get you out. On three. Ready? One, two, three! Well done. I knew you two were great detectives. It seems you're great explorers, too. You all are! But in all the excitement, it seems I've gotten turned around, and I've broken my compass. That's okay. I left marks on the trees just like you showed me. Quite the explorers, indeed. My best adventure? Well, that's easy. It wasn't when I discovered something. It was the time when I got lost. Oh, no! What did you do? What could I do? My foot was stuck! I was alone. Luckily a brave band of explorers used the clues and found me! Hey! That was us! You bet it was! Everybody say, "Explorers"! Explorers! I'm really glad we were able to help our hero. Me, too! We followed the clues and used Commodore Barry's trick of marking trees to get home safely. Following clues is what detectives... and explorers do. Time to close this case. The Case of the Missing Explorer is officially closed. I got it! I got it! Running and kicking are easy, so why's catching gotta be so hard? It just takes practice. Try again. Keep your eye on the ball. You're doing great! I missed it again. Oh, that's okay. You'll get it next time. Look at this! It's an egg. Where'd it come from? It must be lost. Oh, poor thing, out here all by itself. Ha! Now don't you worry. Everything is gonna be okay. Right, Bean? Yeah, it will, but we'd better go talk to Toby and Teri. Nothing beats a nice, neat stack of closed cases. It looks like it's time to open a new one. Why? Oh. Toby! Teri! Help! Wow. So whose egg is it? Uh, we don't know. It's lost, and it's all alone with only me to take care of it! We need to find its mom. Right. That's what I meant. Sounds like we've got a case. Will you excuse us? To the treehouse! We have no idea where that egg came from. We're gonna have to find its mother before it hatches. There's a lot at stake. There always is, little brother. There always is. Let's do this. Let's ace this case! So how's our egg doing? Rumy's calling it Chelsea. Every egg deserves a name. All right. What do we know... about Chelsea? It's an egg. Ha! Chelsea's so much more than that. Birds lay eggs. Oh! Jay's a bird! Jay, is it yours? No! And lots of animals lay eggs, not just birds. Snakes lay eggs, and so do lizards. Sea turtles lay eggs, too, and there was one on the beach this morning. Then let's go talk to that turtle. Hello. Good morning. Our friends found an egg. We thought it might be yours. Would you mind taking a look at it? Not at all. Your eggs are perfectly round, and our egg is more of an oval. And the shells are soft. I'm sorry, but that's not a turtle egg. Thank you very much. I hope you find its mother! And be sure to keep it warm! Thanks! We will! So it's not a turtle egg. And lizards' eggs are even smaller, so Chelsea doesn't belong to a lizard. So we're back to birds. Jay, would you mind checking to see if any birds around here know anything? You got it! I'll talk to anyone with feathers. Is that one of your hats? Yeah. I brought it for Chelsea. Here! Catch! I'll never get that right. That's okay. I got it. Ha. That's better. Isn't it, Chelsea? Oops. Uh-oh! Hold on! I got you! Hey, guys, look who I found! You won't believe it! Remember the killdeer bird? She said she could help. Hello! Now let's get a look at this mystery egg. It's down there with Rumy. That thing is enormous. Is it yours? No. That, I would definitely remember. That egg belongs to a big bird, a fabulously big bird. "Fabulously big." Thanks! I hope you find its Mom, and soon. That thing's about to hatch. But we still don't know who the egg belongs to. So what do we do? We go back to the beginning. Where exactly did you find... Chelsea? Down there, where I just came from. Well, if we're gonna follow the facts, that's where we have to start. There, there. Don't worry. Just relax. We'll find your mama. I promise. So what do we see? There's a ball down here. Rumy and I were playing catch. So is this where you found the egg? Yup. Look. You can still see where the egg was sitting. See here? It's a trail... and look! It goes all the way up the mountain. You're right, Bean. Let's take a look. Whoa! There's a bird up there, and it's gigantic. A condor. Of course! The killdeer said a big bird laid that egg. Condors are some of the biggest birds in the world and the rarest. They only lay one egg at a time. Looks like you're going home. Now let's get climbing. Guys... you go ahead! I'll catch up with you! Hi. I think we have something of yours. My egg! I was so worried. I've been looking everywhere. Here you are, ma'am. No! My baby! Somebody help! Don't worry! I got it! You can do it. Just keep your eye on the egg, and... Yeah! I did it! I caught Chelsea! Rumy, did you see?! Of course I did! You were awesome! Go, Bean! -Yeah! -Wow! Thank you so much. Thank you all. Everybody say, "Great catch"! Great ca-- It feels good to get that bird back to his mother. And nice that she invited Rumy to baby-condor-sit any time he wanted. Time to close this case. The Case of the Orphaned Egg is officially closed.
