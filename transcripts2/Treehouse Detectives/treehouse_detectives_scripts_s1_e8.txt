 Don't move. Almost done. I can't finish if he's gone. Don't worry. Teri took a picture with the WhyTab. Yeah. See? Oh. Perfect. Thanks. Do you have any more animal photos I could draw? You know, why don't you borrow the WhyTab? Then you can take as many pictures as you want.

 Really? Thanks, Teri. I'll take really good care of it. I promise. See you, guys. - What you doing, Millie? - Whoa! Hi, Guys. Terri let me borrow the WhyTab so I could take pictures of animals. Ah. Hey, does it work on shoes? Rumy's got new shoes. I grew out of my old ones. These are bigger. They fit perfectly. New shoes are the best.

 Hmm? What is it? Uh, I don't know. Hmm? Look at this. We saw a ghost. A ghost? Yeah, a real live ghost! It's so cool! There are no such thing as ghosts. But Millie's got a picture. If ghosts aren't real, what's that? A ghost. It has to be a ghost, right? Sounds like we've got a case. Will you excuse us? To the treehouse! I don't think this is a ghost. Neither do I. We need to find out what it is so no one will be scared. There's a lot at stake. There always is, little brother. There always is. Let's do this. Let's ace this case! Okay, Ghost Chasers! If we're gonna chase ghosts, we gotta be ready for some really spooky stuff. Wow! Spooky and stuff, all at one time? Let's do it. Okay! Uh, maybe I should stay here. Uh, I don't want to get my new shoes dirty. No need to be nervous, Rumy. This garlic will keep you safe. If they get too close, fill this bucket with water, and stand in it. Ghosts hate water. And these are... just in case. Remember, ghosts don't bite... unless they do. Let's go find a ghost! Hmm. What are you guys doing? Brave Bean's Ghost Chasing Team, ready and eager to find your ghost! Thank you, Bean. What we need is a ghost hunter who can fly. That's Ghost Hunter Jay! He's our flying specialist. Right! I'm on it! What am I on? Whatever you saw was flying, so you need to look for it in the air. That's why you're asking me! Now I'm definitely on it. Hup! Oh! Yikes! No! I've gotta help Toby and Teri. Never mind! 'Scuse me! And-- And then it flew out of the trees and grabbed me! So it had hands? Yes! Little hands on little arms. What else? Little stubby legs and a long body. Oh, a-and a long tail! The ghost had a tail, like Bean? No, not so puffy, but long. Can I see that picture you took? Of course. Here you go. Kinda looks like a lizard, but lizards don't fly. Neither do leaves, but these leaves are flying, too. Those aren't flying. They're getting blown around by the wind, just like those. I'll bet that's exactly what's happening with our ghost! So it's not flying? No. I think it's getting blown around by the wind. But we can't be sure until we find it. Bean's Ghost Chasers are on the job. We'll check every ghostly nook and cranny! Come on, Ghost Chasers! Nooks and crannies? Aren't they kind of dark? Guys? Uh, hold on! Don't leave me! Wait up! There it is! Run! -See ya! -Bye-bye! Wow. What is this? So, what do you think? It's not a ghost. It's a dried-up lizard skin. With no lizard inside?! How is that not a ghost?! Let me put it another way. Rumy, why aren't you wearing your old shoes? Well, my feet grew too big for them, so they didn't fit. And that's what happens with lizards. As they grow, they shed their old skin every few months. -Oh! -Wow! I wonder who it belongs to. What about him over there? Hey, is this yours? It was, but I got too big for it. Your new skin looks really shiny, and it looks like it fits perfectly. Like my shoes! They're new, too. Those look great, and I bet they fit just right, just like my skin. Well, I gotta go. -See you, guys. -Bye-bye! -See you later! -See ya! -Wow! -Whoa. Wow. Whoa. Now that I know what that is, it's really not scary at all. -I agree! -I'm not scared anymore. Me neither! Say, "Ghost Chasers"! Ghost Chasers! That lizard skin did look kinda like a ghost. When you don't know what something is, it's easy to think all sorts of things. That's why we follow the facts. That's right, and now that Millie knows that lizards shed their skin, she's not scared anymore. So she can go back in the forest. Time to close this case. The Case of the Floating Ghost is officially closed. Thanks, Jay! You got it! Oh, thanks, Jay. You're welcome! How's it going filling in for the mailman? It's fun, but there's a lot of mail to deliver. I've still got a bunch more letters to hand out. Well, you better hurry, because it's getting late. Right. I'm scared to fly through the forest at night. You can do it! You're a great flier! Sure. Okay, I'll try! Nope. I'm too scared. It'll take longer, but I guess I'm flying around the outside of the forest to finish my deliveries. Gotta go! I love that coloring books have neat little lines to show you exactly where you're supposed to color. And I love that it's okay if you don't follow the lines. Hey, Jay! How's delivering the mail going? You look really tired. I am tired. There's a lot of mail to deliver, and it takes forever when you have to fly around the outside of the forest. Why are you flying around it? If you go straight through the center, -it would be so much quicker. -Well, I was at first, but then it got dark, and I'm way too scared to fly through the forest at night. I'm not a good flier in the dark. Sounds like you just need some flying at night lessons. With a teacher, you'll be flying through the dark forest in no time. We should ask the great horned owl! You think he'd help? If he could show me, I could get this mail delivered in no time! He'd love to help. We just have to ask. How are you gonna find him? No one knows where he lives. He's gotta be in the forest. We just have to figure out where. Sounds like we've got a case. Will you excuse us? To the treehouse! Jay is such a good flier. I'm surprised he has trouble flying at night. He just needs confidence. Time with the owl will help with that. There's a lot at stake. There always is, little brother. There always is. Let's do this. Let's ace this case! Someone's gotta know how to find the owl. But there's no one here to ask. How 'bout me? We didn't see you there! You're the exact same color as the leaves. Yup! You really couldn't see me, could you? That's called camouflage. Of course! That's when an animal hides by looking like something in the world around it. Or by disguising themselves as another animal, like that butterfly over there. Look. Amazing! It looks just like an owl! Speaking of owls, do you know where we could find the great horned owl? No. When he's in the trees, it's like he's invisible. I hope Toby and Teri find the owl soon. It's getting dark. I need to learn to fly through the forest at night so I can deliver this mail. Jay, look! Is that him? Definitely. Look at those eyes. Aha. Hello. I'm Jay, who needs flying in the dark lessons! Thank you so much for coming! What should we do first? You wanna show me moves? You can fly. I can watch. Or you can watch. I can fly. Did you nod? I think you just nodded, right? Okay. What if I try to fly between those two branches there? And you can tell me how I'm doing, okay? All right. Here goes nothing. I can't believe it. I did it! You almost crashed into that tree. If that was wrong, the owl would have said. Right, Mr. Amazing Super Teacher Owl? I'll try a loop this time. What do you think? -I'll take that as a yes! -Jay, be careful. It's all right. I've got the best teacher in the world. -You sure about that? -Absolutely! Here I go! Whee! When an animal is using camouflage, they're impossible to find. What else do we know about great horned owls? I saw one flying once. He was as big as me. As big as you? If you were a great horned owl and you were hiding in a tree, you'd need a bigger tree than this. You're right. Where are the biggest trees in the forest? The Old Grove! Whee! I'm doing great, aren't I, Mr. Owl? You're not doing great! You're going to hurt yourself! Now how 'bout I do a tumble curve rocket loop? Why doesn't the owl say anything?! If Jay keeps this up, he's going to hurt himself. Right. You guys go find Toby and Teri. I'll stay here, keep an eye on Jay. Okay. Come on, Bean! Let's go! How's it going, guys? Hey! Rocks don't talk. Unless they're... Rocco! Neat trick, right? So what are you guys doing out here so late? Looking for the great horned owl. Have you seen him? No, and I'd rather he doesn't see me. He might want a snack, and if you hadn't noticed, I'm snack sized, so keep it down, okay? That Owl hears everything. You so much as sneeze, and he can hear it. Ah-ah-ah-choo! Oops. Now I've done it. I better get out of here. See you guys. So the owl can hear you sneeze. Does that help us find him? No, but it might help him find us. Owls must have amazing hearing. He can hear us now? Let's find out. Hello? Mr. Owl? It's Toby and Teri. Jay really needs some lessons from you to help him fly through the trees in the dark. Whoa! So your friend needs night flying lessons? I'd be happy to help. Toby! Teri! You guys gotta come quick. No way! How are you here?! I just saw you with Jay. That wasn't me. I've been right here all day. If you're not helping Jay, then who is? I mean, the teacher looks just like you. Whoever is giving him lessons is just sitting there, watching. It was okay at first. Now it's getting dark, and Jay is taking too many chances. Yeah. Millie's worried that he's gonna hurt himself. We've gotta stop him. Come on. I'll go ahead. You guys follow me! Okay, now I'm going to try a divebomb slingshot turn! Jay, don't. You're really gonna get hurt! Okay, here I go! Whaah! Whoa! Too fast! Ahh! Somebody help! I'm gonna hit that-- No! Hey, you're the great horned owl! Wait. If you're here, who was just giving me lessons? So your owl wasn't an owl at all. It was the owl butterfly. Those aren't his eyes. They're his wings. That's really cool. When he didn't say anything, I thought you were telling me it was okay. But I do need some real lessons. I almost crashed just then. Oh, I don't know. I saw that awesome divebomb slingshot turn you did. Learning to believe in yourself is the first lesson in flying through the forest at night. You did great with that. Really? I'm not sure all those tricks are gonna get the mail delivered tonight. Well, maybe I can give you some pointers on flying at night while we deliver the mail together. Before you go, everybody smile, and say, "Butterfly"! Butterfly! I'm glad we found the great horned owl, but in a funny way, the butterfly helped, too. You're right. He taught Jay a lesson in self-confidence by not even saying a word. Time to close this case. The Case of the Wise Eyes is officially closed
