 Are you getting married to a man or woman? So, they're getting married... I'm in the wedding. You're in the wedding, but you... - talked about them? - That's interesting - from the perspective of that. - That is interesting. And they're right next to you? So, you are in the wedding party for this. Can you talk a little bit about the wedding itself? They recently got engaged. Congratulations. They got the venue nailed down... It's insane to me that you're explaining... No, it's, it's... great. - This is how weddings should be explained. - Yeah. Really build it out. Really tell us everybody involved. For real. Alright, go. So, they got engaged. Um, we all met each other, like the group of friends that are in the wedding all met each other at music festivals. - Oh! - That's sweet. How long ago was that? How long has this pod of pals been going on? 2015. 2015. So, barely, barely. Still... That's a great year, though. It's a good year for making friends. I have so many questions for the wedding couple. Like, "What up with friends you grew up with?" No, you fucking went to Burning Man once, and you're like, "These guys"? Alright. Only friends we met in a Walmart parking lot. All your friends you met in a Walmart parking lot? Can you give us... Tell us who's in that batch of friends that you met in a Walmart parking lot. It's a hodgepodge of friends, from my friends from home, my fiance's friends from college... He is a friend of a friend, who... Do you not have friends of friends? Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ridiculous. Someone who knows someone? Insane. But a friend of a friend to get bumped to the wedding party is a pretty big deal. - You've got to be a good dude. - That's a fast bond. I get that, though. When I fall for a friend, I fall hard. We were traveling... Yeah, it's time you take over. Go. - I think it is. - I do too. - I want it from this guy, - I want to hear it too. So, basically, they tried to ditch us, and the only reason we found them was because I happened to pull in to a supermarket parking lot... When they were trying to ditch you, you caught up to them. Yeah, so then there was an awkward moment real quick. - And now I'm in the wedding. - That's amazing. Give us descriptions of who these people are. Like... Another one is my, uh, college roommate's best friend from high school. I like that as like an identifier of who that person is... on like a core level. Yes, but who are you? - I'm my college roommate's... - Who is that person? - ...friend from high school. - Give us something. His name is Matt. Um, he was my boyfriend in sixth grade. What is happening? So, you went out with him. - Not no more, girl. - In sixth grade, what was he like? He was very short. We all are in sixth grade. We're all pretty tiny then. Yeah, don't judge, man. You were fucking short then, too. Uh... So, when you're in the wedding party, sir, I want to ask you, are you the best man? - I don't know that we know. - No. Did you just find that out now? - Yeah. - Yes... I just found that out. Number seven of seven. Okay, number seven of seven. - You've ranked them. - Yeah. Who's this? You're... you're with someone, maybe? Right there? - Her? - Yeah. No, no, that fucking thing right there. - Whatever that is. - Tell us about that post in front of you. - Whatever that... - Who is this wonderful woman? She wasn't there. This is my girlfriend. - Okay. - Is she invited? She was invited, but she didn't want to go. - This is going to be... - I told you that in confidence. This is going to be on Netflix where everybody can watch it. I know it feels like a normal one of our shows where everybody tells their deepest, darkest secrets. She's invited to the wedding. She wasn't invited to the festival. - Oh! - Ah! That's what we were asking. Okay. Anybody else in the group you'll talk about? We have a friend who's a nurse. - Nurse? - Who's married to... the short guy. Yes. - I cannot tell you... - Wait, so your... sixth grade shorty ass, fucking, ex-boyfriend is still around in your life? - He's in the wedding party. - Yeah, he's my best friend. You guys are the best. What does Short Stuff do? Uh... he listens to live music. We don't really know. You all listen to live music. You guys love music. Anything else you want to ask, or do we do an improv show now? - Let's do an improv show. - Okay, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. We appreciate all four of you guys. Um... So, for the rest of the show, nobody else has to talk. Thank you all so much for being here. We really, really appreciate it. Without further ado, we present to you Middleditch and Schwartz. Hey, Danny. - Dan? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Just checking in. - Do you need anything? Do you think? - Huh? - Do you need anything? - I'm good for now. - Just making the rounds. - I'm good for now. - You good? You look great. - Yeah, thanks. - This is awesome. - Thanks, man. I appreciate it. What a cool tux, man. Oh, yeah, thanks. - Yeah. - Wow! - Twin tail. Shit! - Yeah. - That's awesome. - I'm nervous. - Of course you are, yeah. - I'm nervous. I mean, I'd never do what you do. - But, yeah. - What? I'd never do what you're doing. Sorry. Get married? I wouldn't. But that's so cool, man. That's awesome. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I made the right choice. - Of course you did. - Cool. I mean for you. Yeah, thanks. Is everybody good? Is everybody here? I think so, yeah. I'm just checking in with you. - You know? - They say you get nervous. You get a little nervous right before. - So, this is normal, what I'm feeling. - Of course. - You're going to change your life. - Yeah, for the better. Yeah. For me it would be worse. But I know myself. I know myself. - Yeah. - Yeah, but yeah. You're gonna do great. She's great, you know. Yeah, she is great. - She's fun. - She's fun, yeah. Yeah. Give me another attribute about her. Uh... I met her fou... five years ago. - Thanks. That's helpful. - Four years ago... Thank you. Okay. Yeah. - It's just weird. You know what I mean? - You know what's weird, actually? Uh... I just found out... I probably shouldn't tell you this. No, go, go, go. Come on. - Is it going to fuck me up a little or no? - Uh... Is it going to fuck me up a little, or no? Be honest. Right now I feel pretty nervous. Is it going to fuck me up, or no? I don't... I don't know. I shou... I'm not going to tell you. - Okay. - Alright, good talk. I trust you. - I trust you. - Hey. Um... Um... I actually am going to tell you. Okay, go, yeah. So, I just found out that... Ka, Ka, Ka, Kathleen... Uh... She dated... Short Paul. My fiancée dated Short Paul? - And it was pretty serious. - Wait, stop. Just so I get it in my head. The guy who listens to music? - Yes? - Yes. Short Paul? I mean, it was years ago. You're not talking about the singer Sean Paul? You're talking about Short Paul? Yeah, Short Paul our friend. - Uh... - Because Sean Paul is here too, somewhere. That's great. Did not know that, but that's awesome. That's insane. She never said it to me once. She's known that kid since they were little kids. It was a long time ago. That's just what I heard. It was ages ago. But, apparently it was pretty serious. But... you know... - Hey man, listen... - Who cares, right? Everybody's dated a lot of things before they get... Can you do me a favor? - Can you do me a favor? - Yeah. You're my best man. I need you to do me a favor. - Look me in the eyes. - I'm your best man? Yes. Listen... for the wedding. No, I was gonna... That's fine. That's fine... Okay. You're my best man. Okay? What about your brother? I don't trust him. Okay? When you meet him, you'll know. I don't trust my fucking brother. Okay? Sebastian is like... He's so... It... He's always trying to impress people. Who cares? You know what I mean? But he can front flip from the top of the house - into the pool. - Exactly. But you, I mean you're number seven out of seven. You just got fucking ranked up. - You know what I mean? - I know. What are my responsibilities? - Listen... - What do I do differently? Nothing, it's already the wedding. - It's already happening. Okay? - Okay. I should have told you way before this. Way before. I'm going to be honest with you. It's because everybody else dropped out. - Okay? - Oh, my God. They didn't want to be best men. They wanted to get hammered. They didn't want to think of a speech. - Think of a speech. - Oh... - Okay? Okay. - Okay. Okay. - Sure. - Okay, but can you do me a favor? Just go to Short Paul and make sure he's not gonna do that weird thing where you snap out in the middle of the reception. and you're like, "I say something mean." - You know what I mean? - Yeah. "I object." The part of the wedding where the minister says, "Does anybody want to say something mean?" - Yeah. - Yeah. The part of the wedding where the minister says... - I just want to make sure... - I'm gonna... I'm going to ask him if he's planning on saying anything mean. - Okay. - So I need a lot of time. - Yeah, sure. - Okay. I mean, that's cool. I'll do that. Of course. I'm your best man now, so... - Sure. - Hey. Listen, I know we've only known each other for three years. Yeah? - Three years. - Yeah? And I know at the beginning you were barely going to come. You were the last person on our invite list. Like, I even told... I told Kathleen. I was like, "I don't think so." She was like, "Trust me. Just in case everybody else fucks you over, you'll want a real dingbat to come in there." Okay? Did she call me a dingbat? Yeah, she called you a dingbat. Just listen to me. Okay? - All right. - You can do this. You can do this. Yeah, I know. I want to do this. There's a reason why we cosmically met at that place. - You know what I mean? - Yeah, at the parking lot. You were born for this. - Okay. I'm ready. I'm in it. - You were born for this. What's up, motherfuckers! Sebastian in the house! Ah... Card trick. Anyway. - Hey, bro. - Yo. What's up, bro? - Hey, - Yo, what's up, bro? Hey man, go do the thing. I've got to talk to my brother. Hey, he could stay if he wants. Uh... no! Uh... I've got some stuff to do. Hey! Dude, so I just figured you haven't talked to me about it yet, but probably I should get to my best man speech, - or something like that. - Yeah. Um... About that... Um... Let me tell you how it goes, and you could just give me notes. - Okay? - Sure. Yeah. Uh... - Go ahead. - I was born in 1981. Fuck, was my cock huge. When I came out the doctor was like, "Whoa, is that another baby?" Sebastian, baby. Anyway, I had a pretty good life. Uh... I think about it a lot lately, and you know... You know, one time I jumped off Mount Everest and landed on my feet. Anyway... two people are getting married, Boopity-bop, bippity-bam. Sebastian in the house. I drop the mic into champagne. I pick it up. I drink the champagne out of the mic... Out of the mic? Throw the mic into the audience. Shit, is that a yo-yo? Back to my hand. I go... Ooooh! I do five minutes of really cool stand-up. I sing three of the most popular songs you've ever heard of in your goddamn life. - Okay? And then I put the mic... - I told you, - no copyrighted songs at the wedding. - It's fine. It's fine. Is that cool? If so, I'm going to head out. No, Sebastian, it's not cool. I mean, you could say all that stuff, but, you know, on your own time. - What do you mean on my own time? - Uh... I'm your brother, man? What's going on? - I know, you're my brother. - Talk to me. Okay, alright. Um... I love you, you're my brother, but instead of having you as my best man, I'm going to kick you down to number seven out of seven. Okay, I'll say a joke now. Um... Um... You are... You are 100 feet tall. - Are we just making funny jokes? - No. That's great. That's a funny joke. But Um... Very, very funny. Oh, fuck. Nobody even laughed. But... yeah. No, we're not making jokes. Because... uh... I just need... uh... Uh... - I forgot too. - Corey. I don't think he has a name yet. - Corey. - Corey. I just need Corey to step up to be best man. You know? He and I have gotten real close over the past three years. - And... uh... - It's cool. It's cool. - It's just... - It's cool. You don't trust me. Well, come on. You're going to drink champagne out of the microphone? People will go fucking crazy for it, man. You don't trust me. You never trusted me. But that makes the whole speech about you. It's my day. It's my wedding day. You know, it's cool. I don't want to fuck you up on your wedding day. Alright? I'll just... uh... Do I get to sit at the table with you guys at the dais, or no? Well, you... you want to sit at the table with me my new... - Kathleen. - ...and Kathleen? Yeah. That kind of thing is just like me and her, though, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll go fucking wait in the parking lot. Alright, it's cool. I don't have to... I've got a bow tie and a tie. If I was your best man, I'd tell you you look stupid, but I'm not. This is how they're doing it. Hey, you know what? Even if I'm not your best man, I can fuckin'...I can help you out. Thanks. Thanks, Sebastian. - I'm proud of you. - I'm proud of you too. I mean... You're two months sober, man. That's crazy. Oh... Sorry, dark detail. Dark detail. It's even darker that I was going to drink champagne at the toast. Alright. Yeah. Sorry about that. You know what? I'll just see you out there. Alright? I don't know if you can see me. I won't be at the table. Hey. - Hey, what's going on? - Oh, no! Sean Paul or Short Paul? - Short Paul. - Short Paul. Yeah, I know what Sean Paul sounds like. Short Paul, look. Hey. Hey, how are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm Maid of Honor. I'm good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. - Good to see you. Yeah, good to see you too. Uh... Good to see you too... Marnie. Marnie, yeah, yeah, yeah. My name is Marnie. - Your name is Marnie. - I'm gonna do this. Yeah. Anyway... - You doing pants to this thing? - Yeah. Because I feel like... I shouldn't have to wear... a dress. And Kathleen is so cool. She's like, "Wear whatever you want." - It's a wear-whatever-you-want thing. - Yeah. Did you come by yourself? That's so crazy of me. - Did you come by yourself? Or... - Uh... No, I didn't come by myself. I got my... uh... I'm with... I'm with Lisa, you know, but... Lisa, I met Lisa outside. - She's a sweetheart. She's nice. - She's cool. - Yeah. - She's tall. She's tall. - Do you want me to stomp it? - I got it! Anyhow, yeah, just, you know, outside... - You know. - I know. I wanted to get some air. - It's too much. - Yeah, me too. - Have a smoke. - Everybody's going crazy in there. It's kind of a nerve-wracking thing, I guess. It is, yeah. Yeah. - Yeah, Kathleen wanted... - Yeah, getting married. - Yeah. - It's final. Have you ever been married? No. No, I'd love to get married. - Lisa seems pretty cool, right? - She's alright. She's nice. - She seems so nice. - She's sweet! Yeah. You know who's funny? Who's funny? - Kathleen. - Oh, my God. - Are you kidding me? - She's great. She is... She is so funny. She's beautiful. She's gorgeous. - Her hair and her eyes... - Oh. Yeah. Do you ever just want to go up nice and close and suck out her breath? You know? You said go... I'm sorry, I must have misheard. You... You said go up nice and close and... You know, go up nice and close to her and... get your mouth close to her mouth, and suck her breath out, and now you have her breath in you... I've never heard that before. - Yeah, I don't know. In case we... - Yeah. Probably... you know. I don't know. I've never done that, but I didn't know... Have you known her for some time? Yeah, you could say that. I mean, I'm her maid of honor. I haven't heard her speak about you. What? She hasn't spoken about you. She hasn't spoken about me? Not once? That's crazy. Not once? Um... Short Paul, you said? Well, Paul. Everyone calls me Short Paul. - Paul. - Yeah. Paul. I think I've heard of Paul. - I'm not... - Wait, she talks about me and she doesn't say short, she just says Paul? - Yeah. Why would...? - Jesus Christ. What the heck? Give me a minute. You call yourself Short Paul. Yeah, because everybody does. I mean, it's just how these guys know me. But... I mean, internally... - Yeah. - ...to myself... I am known as Paul. I'm Amber. Are you? I think so. Have we said anything else? I think we... said your name, but I can't remember. - My nickname is Amber. - I thought it was Lisa. Maybe. My nickname is Amber. Should we say Lisa? Your nick... your nickname is Amber? Your nickname is just another first name? It's easy. It's easy. For this moment, it's easy for my nickname to be Amber. Okay. - You want me to call you by your nickname? - Sure. Alright, Amber. Paul. - Yeah, Paul. - Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you too. - Yeah. - I actually love weddings. - Wait. So then... Hold on. We've got to figure this out. I don't think there's much to figure out? No, because then I don't know if I know my girlfriend's name. - Lisa's your girlfriend. - That's my girlfriend. I was trying to make you look good. Yeah. I didn't want to call you out that you were calling me your girlfriend's name. - No, no, no, but you have a name. - My name is Amber! It's Marie... - Marnie... - Marnie. That's my sister's name. How do I forget my sister's name? Marnie. Your sister's name is Marnie? - I forgot that you said it. - So, hold on, your parents named two daughters Marnie and Marnie? No. I was... Never mind. Your... okay. Marnie. - Lovely to see you. - Marnie. - Marnie. Yes. - Marnie, AKA Amber. They're all... - Marnie... - And I'm... - I'm Paul. AKA Short Paul. - Paul. Lisa. - Lisa. Kathleen. - And we know Kathleen. And we know Corey. And we know Dave, Danny... - Danny or Dave. - Sebastian. And we can call that guy Dave if you want. Sure. We got a lot of people hanging out here today. Yeah, and we have so many more. - It's a fucking wedding. - I know. I am... That's why I'm nervous. I'm actually... I have to say a speech today. - Everybody's... - Yeah? Yeah, and it's weird because I get emotional when I think about my past and how we grew up together and stuff like that. You know? - Yeah, sure. Sure. - Yeah. Why? What happened in your past? I don't know. It's just... There's a thing that happened, right? Do I want to know? I don't think you want to know. - But... - But I do want to know. But not even that. Even thinking about the past makes me realize how much I've grown - and how much of my life is over. - That's crazy. - Weddings scare me because of that. - I had something happen in my past too. What? Tell me, please. Do you want me to shuffle it? Okay. Not a lot of people know this, but me and Kathleen, we used to... we used to go steady. - You and Kathleen? - Yeah. That's insane. I've known her for, like, 15 years. - When...? - Ages ago, before then. When? What year? I was in sixth grade. I don't know how old that makes you. - Twelve? - Fourteen, maybe? - No, fourteen, you're at grade eight. - No, twelve. It is twelve. Because that's when I went to a bunch of bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs. Like, right that year after. I'd say sixth or seventh grade. - Okay, cool. - Cool. You guys went out? Did you...? Sixth grade. Did you kiss or anything? Um... We made love. We made love under the moon. - When you were in sixth grade? - For nights on end. We couldn't get enough of each other. I wrote a poem, she wrote me poems. We got in trouble together, we ran from the law. We crossed state lines. We thought about moving to Germany. As sixth graders? How long did this all last? Ah... It's... You know, the brightest suns burn the briefest. There's just the one sun, we just have the one sun. You are telling me that the entire universe has only one sun? - That we know of. - Are you a flat-earther? No. No. But I do think if I had slippery enough shoes, and you took me to one part, I could slide all the way to the end. - It doesn't matter. - What? - What? - Listen, listen... Your... your... What? Your theory on the world is that if you had slippery enough shoes... This is what I'm thinking. ...you could fly from one end to the other. Yeah. Can I explain myself? - Please do. - You're yelling at me. I don't think the world is flat. I don't think the Earth is flat. - Okay. - I think it's round. And because it's round, if you get enough momentum... you'll just slide around. All the way around. - That's insane. - I mean, yeah, I mean... I suppose if you had slippery enough shoes. What happened? How did it end? - Ah. It's embarrassing. - Paul, come on. It's embarrassing? You already told me you made love in sixth grade. Um... Well... One night... It's a story? We were in a taxi cab. - We had just... - Sixth grade still? We had just seen... We had just... seen the opera... Oh, very cool. Um...in our weekend finest duds. And... We're walking... uh... down an alleyway... and... uh... I think I know what's going to happen. And I love it. - Do you? - I love it. Yeah. And... and a guy... - Can I guess? - And a guy came out... in a clown mask. Did he try to steal her pearls? He tried to steal the pearls. Did they go everywhere? They went everywhere. And a kid was watching. Was that kid Dave? Yeah. That's... that's incredible. And, and, and I... Wait... Because that's not even all that embarrassing, but then the guy with the clown mask slipped, and the gun went in the air, and I tried to grab it. And then I... I shot... the guy in the clown mask? I don't know why you're looking at me like you're confused. And he's gone. - And you look like the fool. - And I had one moment to say a really cool line like, "Nice try, clown." But instead... I said... "Oopsie, woopsies." You said, "Oopsie, woopsies?" And Kathleen, she looks to me like I'm crazy. I don't want to kill the guy. Ah... - This is crazy. - I've been to therapy every year of my life. Did you go to jail? Is that why she didn't see you? - No, I... - What happened? The police were like, "Yeah, self defense." But, did you say something cool? - Like, "Get out of my life, clown." - "Oopsie, doopsies." I said. "Oopsie, doopsies," and then the whole... - This is insane. - Cops laughed at me. When I met Dave, the story that he tells even though he's like, "I don't want to tell it right now." - Yeah? - The story he tells, is that he saved her from a robber? That's what he said. I'm sorry, what? They said they met when they were really young, like seventh grade or something like that. Right? And he said that he saved her from being robbed. That's how they met. Oh, God. You ever have a time in your life when you think you might come to a conclusion, and then you think, "Maybe I'll just wait it out," but then something happens and you're like, "No I'm definitely going to do it." Come on. It's starting. - I'll see you in a bit. Okay? - Okay. Alright. Bye. Bye, Amber. - Take care. Marnie. - Yeah. - You can call me Marnie. - Okay. And so the time has come... Revenge. Vengeance. Revengeance. Dave, if that is your real name, you will lose tonight, and Kathleen, you will be mine. Sweet Kathleen. I will take your breath. Okay, I'm, um, um, I'm ready. Yeah. Is she coming? Is Kathleen coming? Do I see her when we go down the aisle? Is the first time I see her right when this happens? When do I see her? I don't know. Who are you? I'm a ghost. Oh! Whoo, whoo, what? You're a ghost? You can't just say you're a ghost then disappear. We'll find out who you are later. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Corey? Corey! Corey! Hey man, I need my best man for a second. - Okay? - Yeah, I got you. I couldn't find Short Paul. I... I... I don't know... I don't... I don't... You didn't get to talk to him at all? No, no, I couldn't find him. Just sit next to him if you see him, and just make sure he's going to be fine - and not say anything mean. - Okay. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay. Alright, do I look okay? - Yeah. - Okay. We're going down, but I don't know... When does Kathleen come? When's the part where we walk down...? We announce you, then you come out. And then we announce Kathleen, then she comes out. Then we do the ceremony. - Okay. - Okay. Alright. I wish we had a handshake, but we haven't known each other long enough. Cool, alright. Stay here. Introducing... Dave, the groom... Motherfucker, that's my brother. That's my brother. Hey. Come on. Give it up. Give it up. Come on, give it up. - Come on, Dave! - I think you're supposed to be up there. Oh, shit. Yeah, I guess I'll be all the way in the back, the last fucking person on the line. Oh, oh! I won't make a big deal out of it. That's my boy. You're his father. I'm their father. Oh, amazing. And... I guess I'm their mom, then. - Nice to meet you. - Lovely to meet you. Ah, I'm so... I'm, like, so excited. Ah... I knew, I knew Dave would get married. - Yeah. - Do you know what I mean? We knew it in the back of our minds. Yeah. Oh. Just loosen up a bit. Okay, loosen up a bit. - I'm loose. - Okay. I just want you to be loose, okay? - I'm loose! - Shush! Don't tell me to loosen up when I'm already loose. - That tightens me. - Harold! Harold! - Harold! - Do you want me tight or loose? I want you loose, Harold. Then don't 'aks' me to be loose. What do you want me to do? How do you want me to make you loose? By not asking me to be loooooose! I'm, I'm sorry, is everything okay? Are you okay? I'm fine! You're very tense. I'm loose! I don't even know you! Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm the father of the bride. - Why are you on this side? - Shush! Harold! Harold! There's a whole other side. Harold! Harold! - By the way, pleasure to meet you. - Lovely to meet you. I feel like we should have met before at some point in time. Oh my God, it is so nice to meet you. - It's so nice to meet you. - I'm, I'm the mother of the bride. Oh, nice to meet you. Pleasure to meet you too for the very first time. How are you! Good, I'm fine. Are you okay? I'm fucking loose, baby. Everybody's asking me if I'm loose. What about you? Are you loose? I'm... loose as a caboose. I don't think you should... ask a woman if... Say it. Loose as a... - You were about to say it. Say it. - But I... Say it. I've never heard the phrase before. It's not something you ask a lady. But I am loose as a caboose. - We do like to have fun. - We have fun. - We do like to have fun. - We're quite... We're... We're half a bottle into a chardonnay. - Oh! That's so lovely. - Can I pour you...? We've got... We've already started drinking. I would love some. Is that okay? - Yeah, sure. - To the bride and groom. Takes the edge off. Yeah, sure, oh... Well... Here you go. Knocked that back pretty quick. Well, okay, now I have your trash. Thank you. Okay. I'm ready. I'm ready if you want to play the trumpet. I can't... I don't really know... many musical instruments. That's fine. Just whatever you can do. Please. You're my maid of honor. Just do your thing. What do they have in here? Ah... Marnie! - Marnie, come on, quick. - I know. I know. - I've got to find something that I can... - Everybody's waiting. Jesus Chri... Agh, I just realized that it's so weird that our parents aren't bringing us down the aisle. Keep going. Yeah. Yeah, that's the weirdest part. Now presenting... Kathleen. If... If that side is the groom's side and the bride's side... - What? - We're all people from the music festival. Yeah! ♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa ♪ ♪ Rock and roll ♪ ♪ Rock and rock and roll, roll, roll, roll ♪ ♪ Rock and rock and roll ♪ ♪ Pooh, rock and rock and roll, roll, roll, roll ♪ ♪ - Rock and rock and roll - Say what ♪ ♪ Rock and rock and roll ♪ ♪ Rock and rock and roll ♪ Oh, yeah. Wooooooh... Ah... Ah... We are gathered here today... to witness... the union... of Dave and Kathleen. I am your officiator. - A ghost? - A ghost. And... I want... everyone here, both the family and the rock and roll enthusiasts... Is that a fucking ghost? Remember, stay loose. ...to witness the bond of love between these two individuals. I love you. We are both here... under our own volition. Yes, of course. We are both here under our own volition. I don't think this is part of the wedding ceremony. Yes, of course. We are. We love each other. No one is here... out of any type of... bribery or extortion? Has this happened enough times where you have to ask this? This is how I do it. - You asked me... - I'm fine. We're good. And you? Mm... I wish I was fucking closer. Did you ask that? - I wish I was fucking closer. - Oh, yeah. Does anyone wish they were closer? Yeah. Me, man. I wish I was fucking closer. Can I get over there? No, Sebastian. What do you want me to do? Be over there? - Yeah. - I'm a motherfucking butterfly. You gonna make me be a worm? Is that what turns into a butterfly? No, that's going. No, no! Oh, yeah. Ah... - Caterpillar. Fuck you. - You're doing, you're doing... you're doing exactly what I didn't want you to do. It's still happening anyways. When you tell someone not to do something, you know, they're going to do it. Tell me about it. Jesus Christ! Okay, very good. May I continue by saying...? Ooooooh! You may. Um... you may. Now... as so saith the scripture. both of you are in love, you have prepared your own vows. But... before we get to those vows... as per the doctrine... I must ask... Does anybody have anything mean to say? What the fuck is this? "Anybody have anything mean to say?" Yeah, I dos. Um... okay, the short gentleman in the back. Paul. My name is Paul. What're you doing? You'll ruin the whole thing for them. I got something mean to say. This is my daughter's special day. Okay? Well, if it's so special, why are you half... lit? Because I'm not sure. Okay. Jesus. You! You. This whole time, all these years... you've been telling everybody, her included. Paul, what are you doing? - Paul, what are you doing? - Her included. What are you doing? Paul, what are you doing? Don't make me... Listen to me. - What the fuck are you doing? - That way back when in the alleyway, when I stopped the clown robber, it was you who stopped the clown robber. Were you just taking credit just because I said "Whoopsie, doopsie?" What's the real... What's... what's... You know, I stopped her. You should stop talking right now. Okay? Paul, you had your chance. What are you doing? You're embarrassing me. My parents are here. My entire parking lot is here. Don't. Just... Okay, good. I got something mean to say? I'll allow it. Okay, get it over quick. Taking credit for other people's murders is not cool. Especially when the consequences are true love. A love that I always had and will never know again. Sorry, Lisa. You're alright. You're fine. I didn't even want to come to this wedding. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry, the show's already started. You can't leave. You got the bouncer from the music festival to come to the wedding? Alright, make it quick, Paul. I'll allow it. If you're the type of guy that steals other people's murders and, consequently, steals other people's true loves... then you... are some kind of fucking... du... dumbass. Hey. - Shit! - He fucking blew it. He could have said the perfect thing and he blew it. Shit! Hey Paul, you know what? Why don't we let the lady decide. You really think you had something with her? Oh, yeah, of course I did. Then let her decide. I'll allow it. Honey. - Honey, look at me. - The rules state... if something is said that's mean enough, on the spot, the lady can decide. - Oh! - This is easy. I've been dating you since the seventh grade. - Well... - Okay? Just look at Paul. Paul's been dating me since the sixth grade. I mean, not actively. We just had a moment. A moment in 6th grade. - What did you do, kiss? - Uh, mm. Oh, hooooo... Oh, baby! Tell 'em. Tell 'em. Tell 'em. Why is there a microphone being lowered? Um... Uh... I... We did a little bit more than kiss. In sixth grade? Yeah. We made sweet, sweet love. We made love every kind of way you could ever dream of. We did it romantic style. We did it nasty style. We went to peep shows and got all excited and then fucked on the dirty little... sofas at the peep shows. I don't want to know anymore. We were just two kids... - Two... - Two sixth graders? Yeah... - Just do it. - There's... Just do it. Look him in the eyes and choose. Me or him. Just look him in the eyes and choose. Hey! Let me tell you something before you choose, okay? I... I... I love you. I love you. I've... I've loved you since the moment I saw you. Remember? Remember when we... sharpened our crayons together? - That was right after we had sex. - Yes! Nasty style! Real nasty style! And I love you. And I know he thinks he knows what love is, but I... have felt it since the moment I saw you. And I'm telling you that I saved your life that day. So, if it's just some weird thing you have because he saved your life, let me tell you this. I saved your life. So, choose. Choose. Choose. - Choose. - Choose. Choose. Choose. Choose. - Choose. - Choose. My son's waiting. Choose! ♪ - Darling choo-oo-oose - Choose ♪ ♪ Choo-choo-choose ♪ Choose, sweetie. Choose. Choose. Yes! I mean, is there? Is there any real way... you could actually prove that you did that? That you were really saved… or is this just another figment of your imagination? You were so creative as a sixth grader. Is that what this is? You want me to prove that I actually murdered the guy? Is there any way you could do that? Uh... I guess not. Wait! I can do it. You! I was the clown that day. - That's why I'm a ghost. - Oh! That move worked perfectly. You! Yes, and I can tell you how it went down. Huh... I went to steal your... pearls right in the alley after the opera. I was like, "Why are two sixth graders going to the opera? This will be an easy steal." Or, so I thought. I snatch your pearls, they go all over the place. You... Dave... You did nothing. But you, Paul? First of all, you look great tonight. You look fantastic. But, Paul? I know. I know. Thank you. I look great too. Say it again. I can't hear you. Say it again. Speak up! You didn't try to save the day. My gun fell, you slipped, you hit me, and then you said... Tell everyone. Take the microphone. Tell everyone. Was it something cool? I said, I said, "Whoopsie, doopsie." You said, "Whoopsie, doopsie?" Yeah, I said, "Whoopsie, doopsie." So, you see... it was an accident. And I'm being pretty cool about it. So, you're telling me... that the gun just went in the air and... it shot accidentally, and no one pulled the trigger other than it sort of falling, - and it shot you? - That's correct. - And that's how you died? - I'm telling you, the only way you can make your decision is love and not consequence. So, with that... I'll still be the priest if you want. Yeah. Stick around. I think you're going to want to hear this. Okay. Go. Short Paul... Um... you're a great guy. Thanks. Um... you treated me real... nice, but real intense. And I returned the favor. - We had a great time in sixth grade. - We had the best time. Before you finish that sentence, - we had the best time. - But, Paul... that was sixth grade. I'm a woman now. A lady, even. And I've found something else. And I think you got to let the past be the past, you know? You wanna fuck one more time? - No. - Right. No. Lisa? We cool? No. You... you fucking psychopath, no. And you know what? Corey, dude, you were supposed to stop... - Short Paul - Fuck! - if he was going to do anything crazy. - Shit! - I didn't do the one thing. - You had one thing to do, and you didn't do it. Buddy, I got no other choice. I've got to bump you to the back of the line. It was an honor. Sebastian? No, come on, man. Is this for real? - You're my brother. - Come on, man. - Is this is for real? - Of course, it's for real. After we do our little thing here, you want to do your routine? My best man, speech? - Can I stand right there? - Of course you can. Hey! I love you. I love you too, baby, baby bro. Do you? Do you marry? I do marry. - Do you marry? - I do marry. Then... Ah... Then... You've got to kiss each other. Oh! Alright. Now, let's get down for the party. I think my best man's got something to say. Yeah, that's right. I've been preparing... Everyone... sh... shut up. My boy... my second-born has something to say. Grab the mic, baby. What's up, motherfuckers? I said what's up, motherfuckers? Yeah, give me a beat. Give me a beat. Give me a beat. Give me a beat. Okay, that's good enough. You know... You know, Da...? Dave? Yeah. I don't want to say a fancy speech. Just want to say I love you both very much. And I can see why you guys fit perfectly together. I love you. And I don't have to wish you luck because I know you'll be alright. I love you, and I love you. Even me? I love you too, ghost. Oh! Oh! Whoa! Whoa! Uh! That's all I needed. That was my unfinished business. No, somebody stop him. He's a robber. - He's an actual robber. - I'm going to Heaven. - What the fuck? - Fuck it. That's our show!
