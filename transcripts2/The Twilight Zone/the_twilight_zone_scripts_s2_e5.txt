 This is why Wordsworth says that poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings. The emotion is contemplated to the subject of... Ah, there she is. This place can be a maze. Class, this is Irene. She's gonna be joining us for the rest of the semester. Go ahead, introduce yourself. Uh, hi, hello. Like she said, my name is Irene. And where you're from and what you like.

 Oh, um I guess I like stuff. Um... Indian food and memes and monsters. Cool stuff. I mean, I-I like other things, too, you kn... whatever. Irene will be starting her science fair project tomorrow so she can catch up. And it's a spooky one. Uh, tell the class. Um, I-I thought I might do a project on psychic abilities? Yuck. Do psychic powers, like, do they really exist?

 Ooh, we can't wait to find out. Irene, go ahead and have a seat. She looks like she's planning on being the first girl school shooter. Jesus, Gwen. Funny, though. When we talk about the sublime, what do we mean? Take a look at the elements of this poem. There are concepts and motions that are heightened beyond typical human experience. That's what Wordsworth and Blake and Hugo are grasping at here, the sublime. These poets also express a clear interest in the deification of imagination. Imagination is placed above experience. Irene? Do you need a pencil so you can answer the question? Think of these poets as expressing an ideal, instead of reflecting on the nature of reality around them. Hey. Your head got in the way of my pencil. Could you fetch it? Cupcake. My pencil. Now. High school. It's a period that, for most of us, already feels like a waking nightmare, one in which we're lost in a maze, searching for ourselves. But what if, during this precarious phase of our development, you introduced a set of extraordinary powers? That's all it will take to send the student body of St. Mary's Boarding School on a harrowing field trip to The Twilight Zone. You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition. And it lies between the pit of one's fears and the summit of one's knowledge. You are now traveling through a dimension of imagination. You've just crossed over into The Twilight Zone. I think I would like to change my project. Oh? Yeah, so I was thinking about it, and I'm not sure that psychic stuff really represents me. I'm sorry, sweetie, but the science fair guides have already been printed. I'm sure everyone is gonna like your psychic, uh, test thing. So, um, these are called Zener cards. They have one of five symbols on them. So, I'm gonna pull a card from the deck and stare at it, and then you write down what you think the card is by trying to, like, read my mind. I do not want to be inside her mind. Quiet. What? It's Irene. Hi. Uh, is this a bad time? Always. Oh. Well, uh, I just wanted to talk to you about your test results. Maddy, bring her in. Can you imagine? Did she bring Indian food? She have any memes for us? What's wrong with my test? Well, uh, nothing. It-It's-it's actually weird, you know, because, like, you technically can't really get lower than five on average... Okay, what the hell are you talking about? Use your words. You got zero on every test. So? That's not possible. It-It's like you know what the answer is and are specifically not choosing it. Or it means I'm really not psychic. Because it's stupid bullshit. But you can't I know it's hard to imagine someone who's normal when you are... like you are. N-No, see, normal would be five right. I don't want to get ahead of myself here, but you could have, like, superpowers. Maybe you're suppressing them. I don't know, but if you have psychic abilities, you could do anything. Like what? I don't know. Whatever you wanted. Cool stuff. I-I'd like to do another test. Maddy, if you want to go off with your new friend... Don't you know that being a dork is contagious? Uh, yeah, no, sorry. I don't have your dumb nerd powers. Go, Maddy. I give her two weeks till she transfers. Circle. Cross. Star? This is stupid. Cross. Square. Waves. S-Star. Square. Star. Cross. Circle. Cross. Star. Cross. Square, circle, waves. What the fuck? Thought you could prank me, bitch? - What? - Thought you could scare me with your stupid cards? - Tell me the fucking trick! - I... I-I swear, Madison, it's not a trick. - Bullshit! - Madison, I swear. - Do you think I'm stupid? - No. What's your little plan? Th-They're just cards. They're just cards with pictures on them, that's it. Then how come I know what's on every fucking card? Because you're special! You're, like, I-I don't know, you have psychic powers or something, which is crazy, because I didn't even really think they were real, okay? Like I don't know, okay? Look, if it's real, it's, like, the coolest thing to ever, ever happen to, like, anyone. Jesus. Stop talking. So what do I do? Uh, I don't know. I mean, I-I know a lot about psychic stuff, but I-I've never actually met a real psychic before. I... I guess we could, you know... Or you could figure out what powers you have, and then we could figure out how to use them for stuff? Fine. If this is a prank, I'll ruin your life. I promise it's not. Okay. Okay. Okay, great. What, are you trying to burn the place down? Well, I read that, uh, natural lights and fire can help with psychic focus. But, I mean, we could just use the regular light. This is so corny. So, um uh, I wrote down the major abilities. Uh, the big ones are astral projection, clairvoyance, conjuration... Wait, hang on. Stop. None of that shit means anything. Okay, right. So, there's... Right. So, this one is projecting your mind into another place so you can see things. Uh, the next one is reading people's minds. Conjuration is the ability to materialize objects out of thin air. Dowsing is sensing where water is. Yeah, we don't need to check for that one. I don't care where water is. Right. Who needs to know where water is? Okay. Okay, then there's, um, flying, moving stuff, knowing stuff, seeing the future, planting thoughts into people's heads, and, finally, um, controlling fire with your mind. That's a power? I mean, it's been reported. That would be cool. Why do you care about all this shit? I don't know. Don't you want to be normal? Or cool? Yeah. I... I mean, I-I didn't even want to do this project, you know? But, like, Ms. Watson made me. Like, I wanted to do something about, like, marijuana, or getting high, like, how cool that is. Okay. So what do we do here? Test you here. Uh, see what kinds of powers you have, and then maybe we can figure out how to use them for stuff. So, uh, what do you see? Circle. Yes. Wow. Wow. Okay. Cool. Yeah. Wow. Why don't I know how I'm doing it? Have I always been doing it? Well, um, you don't really know how you see, you just... have it. So it would follow that a sixth sense would be the same way. Like, you can't feel it, you-you just have it. Mm... Right. But, like I've never been able to see what's on a card, and now it's like it's nothing. Yeah. Every time you do it, you get better at it. Like anything. Okay, let's try this. Hey, what are you doing? Well, I want to see if you can read minds since you have astral projection. So... now the card doesn't exist anymore, so you can't, like, look at it in space with, like, psychic eyes... You can only read my mind. So, what do you see? Look at me. - Star. - Yes. Do another. I just want to be like her. Hey, it's Debbie, right? Hi. We're sitting here. Why don't you take your tuna fish sandwich and your french fries somewhere else? Let's go, let's go, let's go! Or do you want me to tell everyone how you saw your stepdad jerking it to QVC? And watched him finish. Irene, did you do your makeup different? What? Oh. Uh... Yeah. I-I just tried something I saw in a tutorial. It's great. I-It's almost there. You used too much foundation. It makes you look old. Here. Oh. Okay. Don't load up along the eyes. Gives you crow's-feet. Thanks. You should do videos online for hair and makeup or, or whatever. Yeah, like Gwen or Lisa? Or everybody? I'm sure yours would be better. I'm good. So what's our thing? Right. Um, so tonight is telekinesis. Moving something with your mind. Let's move some sand. Well, I mean, there are still a lot of powers. Putting thoughts into people's heads and, uh, conjuring things. Yeah, I'm done for tonight. I want to get out of here. Okay, uh, I'll clean up. Just blow out the candles. Leave it. No one ever comes down here. Come on, let's go. Don't worry, we'll try again tomorrow. So, how did you find out about the bathroom? Like, did you see it, like, in a vision? N-Nah. We used to hang out on the roof, like, on the balcony. But they changed the locks, and now no one can get up there. We used to get high as fuck up there, and the teachers never caught us. Anyway, Gwen's older sister told us about the bathroom 'cause that's where she and her friends used to hang out. But Lisa's claustrophobic, so we don't use it. Oh. - The roof sounds really cool. - Sha. Ladies. Stop right there. It is 1:00 in the morning. What are you two doing in the hallway? Nothing. We-we weren't doing anything. Now you're lying. You're looking at a serious demerit. It's unacceptable. No. Excuse me? I said no. You're gonna let us go back to our rooms, or I'll tell the dean you've been raiding the petty cash drawer on the weekends. - Young lady... - I'm sure the headmistress would love to hear about you spending school slush funds at the casino. You're really in a hole. $2,500 and counting? Give us the key to the balcony. I don't have the key to the... What? Give us the key to the balcony as collateral. We'll never tell anyone about your little gambling problem. You two head back to your rooms this instant. That was pretty baller. I mean, it was worth a shot. Fuck, that would have been awesome. I wish I could hypnotize people or whatever. Fucking shit. Oh, I really wanted that key. Oh, my God. No. You can conjure. Holy shit. Let me get Gwen and Lees. What are you doing? Let's go. Oh, my God, open it, open it. Holy shit, it worked. What is it? The key. Oh, my God. What's happening? I don't know. It's like maybe it only exists until it's served its purpose? So I have to conjure a new key every time? That's shitty. Okay. Never have I ever... been arrested. Shoplifting. I took four pair of Birkenstocks - out of Nordstrom. - Oh, shit! Why four? I mean, were they all the same, or...? Are you a narc? Huh? Mad, your friend is really cringey. Yeah. Are you a virgin? I mean... Have you ever orgasmed? Well, sure, yeah. Who hasn't orgasmed? With who? Well, like, I mean, I've had orgasms. Just not with, you know, a-a boyfriend. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Wait, wait, okay. Have you ever been high? Yeah, tons of times. Like, all the time. You're crazy, huh? Yeah. You bet I am. - Oh, shit. - Ooh. Okay, that's enough. Maybe we should head back. Wait, we're just getting started. Yeah, Maddy. Let's see if we can get her to take her shirt off. See them itty-bitties. I'll do it. - I don't care. I don't care about anything. - Oh! Hey, will you fucking stop? What are you doing? Ugh, why did you even invite her, Madison? Shut up. Maddy, come on. She's not even embarrassed about how embarrassing - she's being. - Fuck off, Gwen. Oh, my God. I hate you. Oh, I know, Gwen, I know. I also know you masturbate with a hairbrush. - The fuck are you talking about? - Whatever, Gwen. Oh, sorry I insulted your girlfriend. Is that the best you can do? You used to be so much meaner. I guess blowing a 30-year-old in a bar bathroom really takes a lot out of you. Okay, who's telling you this shit? Is it you? No, I haven't said anything. I can go. I'm-I'm sorry. - Good. Go. - Stay. Gwen, you're being a bitch, and it's a bad look. Guys, come on. This is awesome. Everyone has secrets, and it's okay. Oh, my God. What, what happened? Oh, my God, did, did you save me? - I didn't do anything. - You must have. Something unconscious. Something we didn't know you could do. No. Look, I don't know what happened, but you should get back to your room before somebody comes. Hey, Irene. Come sit with us. You fucking psycho. - I'm gagging. - You should be dead right now. Well, falling off a roof doesn't hurt if, if you don't give a fuck all the way down. What's this whole new vibe? Well, I-I tried this thing I saw in Girls Beat, where they, um, they painted one finger silver and then the rest pink. - I love it. - Really? - Awesome. - Yeah. Okay, you're a freak. Okay, I'm ready to lie down. Say cheese. What is this? What, Madison? Shit got lit. Let's go. - Oh, my God, Irene. - My head. How much did you have to drink? I don't know. Stop hanging out with them. What? Oh I'm sorry I missed training. We can still do it. I don't give a fuck about training. I don't give a fuck about you, but I'm telling you now, stop hanging out with them. Wow. Okay. Are you really that jealous about me being friends with your friends? None of us are friends. They don't talk to me anymore. I mean, what am I even doing here anyway? You know what? We're done. Do you hear me? You and I are done. Hey! Irene, did you hear me? I said make sure you visit our booth tomorrow at the science fair. We've got a surprise for you. You'll love it. This is your project? Yeah. It's a real medium effort. I guess. I know you joined school late, but this work is unacceptable. Okay. And here we have the loser in her natural habitat. Hey, Irene. Want to check out our project? Doesn't everyone fart in their sleep? Ew! Ugh. I'll shave my legs after I get a boyfriend, I guess. See them itty-bitties. I will. I don't care. I don't care about anything. I'll shave my legs after I get a boyfriend, I guess. - I've had orgasms, just not... - Oh, she's gonna cry. I'll do it. I don't care. I don't care. What did you do to them? Did you know that they were gonna do that to me? - What did you do? - I don't know what you're talking about. It's been your power this whole time. Yours! You've been controlling me, pretending like I had these abilities, manipulating me so that you could become popular! Putting thoughts into my head with your teleke... whatever the fuck. - Madison, I swear, I... - Shut up! You did do something to those cards. You've been there every time I used my powers, because they're your powers. You fell from three stories. You should be dead! Madison, I promise... - You made me think I was special! - You are! That's why I never felt anything when I used my powers. I don't have them. Did you kill Gwen? Lisa? I don't have powers, I swear! - Bullshit! - It was you. You saw me crying. You defended me. Why would I defend you? You ruined my life! God, I'm so fucking stupid. You know, I... I really thought, that when the door opened, and you walked in that day I wanted you to be some normal girl. I wanted someone. I wanted a friend. Instead, I got this nonstop nightmare. Why is it so hard for you to accept that we are friends? You are in all of this pain because you won't admit that you are different. You won't admit that you care about people. You won't admit that you care about me! And now, you won't admit that you saved me, with your powers, from people who were hurting me. You said yourself that none of you were friends. Well, we are. We are friends, Madison. Why won't you accept it? You're just gonna hurt me or betray me or go away. No. I never will. I am your friend. I'm your friend, too. Madison? - W-What's happening? - Madison? Oh, my God. You wanted a friend. Oh, my God. Irene. On the surface, Madison appeared to have it all. But on the inside, she was lost, alone. So she created Irene, a projection in every sense. One part wish fulfillment, another part confession. An unconscious cry for help from within her psychic prison in The Twilight Zone. Captioning sponsored by CBS
