 [BIRDS CHIRPING] [MUSIC PLAYING OVER P. A. ] [DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE] EVE: So, down this way is the bathroom, which I would like everyone to use. I don't want semi-strangers using my master bedroom bathroom. This is a new parent dinner for third grade parents and my husband and I are some of the new parents. We want to make an impression. [WHISPERING]: We don't want to start a party war, if you know what I mean.

 [LAUGHING]: Parents just get so competitive. No problem. Absolutely. Now, I was thinking of putting the bar out here on the patio because that'll force people to mingle, right? LEE: Yeah, I agree. That way, everyone has to go all the way through your house and see everyone if they want to get a drink. That's what I was thinking. Anna! Oh. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Wait. Am I going to have to rent heaters for the patio? Anna! ANNA: Hmm? Delivery. But, renting heaters would be worth it because it would keep people out of the house. Right? Now, how much setup time do you need?

 And you guys oversee everything, right? 'Cause I'd rather not have to do anything. [CHUCKLES] [MUSIC PLAYING OVER P. A. ] [MUSIC CONTINUES IN DISTANCE] ♪ ♪ Mrs. Eve? I-I didn't mean to scare you. Oh, sorry, I was just... In another world, there. Good night. Thank you for everything. We'll see you tomorrow. Can-can I ask... eh, you a question? Yes, sure. Is everything okay? Yes. Yes. Well, my grandson, we want him to go to the charter school. Matheson Charter? Yes. But my daughter does not live in that district. Wait... You have a grandson? How did I not know this? Look at him. He's adorable. Daniel. Well, how can I help Daniel? Well... Can we use your address as his home address? You do live in the school district. I don't want you to get in any trouble, Mrs. Eve. Daniel was born here. He's legal. I will work your party or anything for free. I would owe you so much. You don't owe me anything. Of course you can use our address. You're part of our family, Anna. Daniel should go to any school he wants. [SIGHS]: Oh, thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Eve. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Is that someone at the door? I'll-I'll get it on the way out. Thank you. Thank you. Anna. Anna, wait a minute! Anna, I'll get the door. [SIREN WAILING] Anna Giron Y Fuentes? ANNA: No. Please. OFFICER: Mrs. Fuentes, you're gonna have to come with us. [GASPS] [GRUNTS] OFFICER: Manos en la... Manos en la cabeza. You two, upstairs, now. [PANTING] Oh. Anna, um... Where are you taking her? We have a 10-15, pilgrim confirmed. When Bill gets home, we'll get a lawyer! It was an absolute nightmare. They just walked in through the front door, guns out, and took Anna away. And I said, "You cannot walk into my house and do this." You said that? Of course I did. Anna's part of our family. So brave. It's so awful. I'm so sorry, Eve. I gotta say though, these people know the risks when they come here. What can you do? I mean, it's unfortunate and everything, but it is illegal, right? Gretchen. You know what I mean. So what happens now? I don't know. We have no idea where they took Anna. Bill hired an attorney and they can't find her. Her family hasn't heard either. I just... I can't believe this is happening to her. GRETCHEN: The thing is, too, is that the next person you find is just going to have the same problems. STACEY: Right? [CHUCKLES] Lucy came to us and wanted health insurance. And we're like, "Do you watch the news?" Legal Americans can't get health insurance. I know. Lete wanted to pay taxes. I said, "If you want to be a real American, you try to get out of paying taxes. "Right? CONSTANCE: They just don't know how things like that are not helping them. GRETCHEN: Mm. It could expose us. And them. [GASPS, WHIMPERS] ♪ Memories... ♪ ISABELLE: Hey, Mom, can we have plantains for breakfast? EVE: Have what? ISABELLE: Plantains. It's what they eat for breakfast in Guatemala. JACKIE: When does Anna come back? Well... Anna went back to Guatemala to visit her family. But we're her family. Well, Anna has her own family, too. Hey. Tomorrow night is our new parent dinner thing, - so tonight it's... Grubhub! - [CHEERING] I hope she's okay. WILLIAM: We'll find her. Somehow. [CAR ALARM CHIRPS] Mom, you're kinda parked in two spots. We won't be long. Anna hates when people park like you. "No seas pendejo!" [CHUCKLES] Hey, Mom, can I have a dollar? For what? Otto. No, honey, you're too young to play the lotto. No, Otto. He plays guitar. He's always here. - Hey, Otto. - Hey, Otto. OTTO: Hey, Jackie. Brought your mom today, huh? ♪ ♪ ISABELLE: Mom, we didn't get ice cream. [WHISPERS]: Ice cream is bad. Do you have a rewards card? Um... Uh, no. Oh, uh, I don't know. [CHUCKLES] ISABELLE: 6655213. $356. 19. [BOTH GIGGLE] Is there another card you'd like to use? What for? This one's been declined. What? No, that's... that's impossible. SHOPPER 1: Come on. Hurry up. SHOPPER 2: Are you serious? SHOPPER 3: Hey, what's the holdup? SHOPPER 4: Come on. [WHISPERS]: Okay. Sure. That one's declined, too. Seriously? SHOPPER 4: Come on, lady. Jesus. Something's wrong with your machine. Something's wrong with you. Can you please call for another checker? Maybe you can step out of line until I get a manager. Okay, fine, you know what? Just forget it. SHOPPER 3: What's going on up there? Forget it. Forget it. You don't want my money, keep your goddamn groceries. Come on, let's go. Put in her card twice. What about the groceries? We're going to another store. [CAR ALARM CHIRPS] Mom. Are we going to get in trouble for leaving all those groceries? Get in the car. [TIRES SCREECH] What is this now? Excuse me! I'm trying to get out. Could you please pull up a bit? Mom, just pay for the groceries. EVE: Excuse me, I'm trying to leave, could you pull up a bit? [ISABELLE AND JACKIE GASP] Good afternoon. Are you Eve Martin? Yes. Please step out of the vehicle and come with us. You have the wrong Eve Martin. You girls, come with us. Mom! EVE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No. You leave my kids alone. It's all right, Mrs. Martin. For safety's sake, your children will be transported to the facility in a separate vehicle. Facility? Yes, ma'am. Your husband's on his way, as well. This is a matter of national security. Meet Eve Martin. Loving mother, devoted wife, active in her community. Eve was raised to view the world from a bubble of comfort, safety and privilege. But that bubble... is about to burst. And when it does, she will find herself within the strange and unfamiliar borders... of The Twilight Zone. [THE TWILIGHT ZONETHEME PLAYING] NARRATOR: You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition. And it lies between the pit of one's fears and the summit of one's knowledge. You are now traveling through a dimension of imagination. You've just crossed over into The Twilight Zone. [EVE EXHALES] [INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT OVER P. A. ] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WOMAN [OVER P. A. ]: You will be called by number. Oh, William. Hi. Hey. Do you have the kids? No. No, they're being held in the juvenile wing upstairs. They won't let me see them. What is going on, William? I don't know. They showed up at my office in the middle of a presentation. [EXHALES] WOMAN: See if you can find out something. MAN [OVER P. A. ]: Number 71. [WHISPERING]: Did they tell you it was a matter of national security? Yeah. Do we need a lawyer? I don't know. I, uh, I left a message with my business attorney, just in case. My credit cards were declined. Oh. Oh, well, that... [CHUCKLES] that must be it. It has to be identity theft. Someone hacked your credit cards, and now these... people think that you're a, uh... a terrorist. William... I told Anna she could use our address so she could get her grandson into Matheson Charter School. Could that be the reason why we're here? Maybe Anna's kids are into something we don't know about. Well, I-I... I have to think this is just a bizarre misunderstanding. At some point, we're gonna talk to someone who will tell us the deal, and we can explain ourselves, and, um... we're gonna go home. Okay? And then it'll just be a great story for Gretchen and Stacey. Hey. Hey. I'm here. Okay? Yeah. Yeah? William and Eve Martin? Follow me. [LOCK BUZZES] [LOCK BUZZES] [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] I apologize for the wait. Always seems to be more work to do than there are people to do it. I'm sure you understand. Where are our children? [SIGHS]: Ah... Martin. Well, there it is. Mr. Martin, finance manager, and, Mrs. Martin, you are a stay-at-home mom. Can you tell us why we're being detained? Yes. Uh, you've been married six years, and your daughters are eight years old? Do we need an attorney? This isn't really a... an attorney thing. This is America. [CHUCKLES]: Everything is an attorney thing. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] [CHUCKLES] Okay, I'm just... I'm just curious. Does this have anything to do with... [WHISPERS]: Matheson Charter School? You tell me. No. - No, no, no. You brought her in here. - Okay. I told our housekeeper, Anna Fuentes, she could use our address so her grandson could go to Matheson Charter. I did it. So... whatever we need to do to make things right, we'll do it. A donation to Matheson or... wherever... we'll do that. Are you suggesting a financial inducement to your release? Uh... That is a shame, because... [CHUCKLES] this has nothing to do with Mrs. Fuentes at all. Well, what does it have to do with? We have a right to know why we're here. [LOCK BUZZES] That's best not to discuss in front of the children. Mom! Hey! WILLIAM: Hey, come on, come on. [WHISPERS]: Okay? I owe you an apology. That is the problem with government these days. Inefficiency. The inefficiency is astounding. There really was no reason to drag all of you down here today. [CHUCKLES]: Forget it. I'm just saying, forget it. No harm, no foul. We'll just show ourselves out the door. Just how-how exactly do we get out of here? No, no, no, no, I'm sorry, you misunderstand. William, you, Jackie and Isabelle will be released momentarily. Eve will remain with us a bit longer for further evaluation. What?! Mom? Daddy? I don't understand. I... I'm gonna get a lawyer and get you out right away, okay? Mom, what's happening? It's okay, girls. Eve... it's in your best interests not to resist. Ow. That's... gel polish. Sign here. WOMAN: I'll take your right thumb. MAN: Next. WOMAN: Face forward. Look at the camera, please. [CLICKS] Next. Okay, I signed the papers. Do I get to go now? I have a new parents dinner tomorrow. ♪ ♪ [DOOR OPENS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [DOOR CLOSES, LOCK CLACKS] ♪ ♪ Mrs. Eve? Mrs. Eve. What did they say you did? They didn't say; I have no idea why I'm here. Anna, I am so sorry. I had no idea they would take you to a place like this. Yes... you did. You knew. Where did you think they would take us, to the Four Seasons? When it was just on the TV, you could turn it off or change the channel. I assumed they would deport you back to Mexico. I am from Zacapa. It is in Guatemala. I have been with your family for almost 11 years. I wiped the shit and snot from your children. Your children, they speak Spanish to me. A language y-you don't understand. I sat with Jackie and Isabelle when they had fevers. Held them when they fell. Tell me, what are the names of my children? When someone is a part of your family, you know their names. Right. I'm sorry, Anna. I know why you are here. I've known for some time that we've come from the same place. You did try to help Daniel, so I will help you. [TOILET FLUSHES] ♪ ♪ [DOOR CREAKING] Go. Go! [QUIETLY]: Hey. But... you were at the store this morning. Otto? If you want to know why you're here, you got to come with me now. Come on. What? Oh... you don't trust me, only because I don't look like you. But we're the same. [SHUDDERS] You're gonna think she's speaking English to you, but she's not. Only people like us can understand. And when you're done, you can't tell anyone about me being here. I work for Aidia. I work for us. Go. It's so good to see you again, Eve. I see. You don't remember who you are. You're not alone. So many of us were left behind. So many afraid to see if a blue sky was possible instead of the gray skies we lived under. [WHISPERS]: What is she talking about? You need to listen. We thought the young would never need to know where they came from. That we'd just... fit in here and... disappear. They hate that we are here. They're rounding us up. And now you need to remember who you are before they do so they can't unlock your memories. The people here want to send us back. But this is our home now. We love our home. We add to our home. We can't go back home. We're already here. This place is ours now, too. Not just theirs. [LOCK BUZZES] Oh. No, no! You can't do this! WOMAN: Please! AIDIA: No, you can't do this! No, no! You can't do this to us! No! We belong here! It's ours! Not theirs! [TASER CRACKLING] ALLENDALE: Eve. Eve, welcome back. Doesn't feel very welcoming. The straps are just for your own safety. Now, let's get you back where you belong. What are you doing? Why are you doing this to me? We're evaluating you. Evaluating? I just need you to answer a few questions. No. You haven't answered any of mine. Hmm. ♪ Taunting me ♪ ♪ A memory... ♪ [ALARM BLARES] ALLENDALE: True or false? [GRUNTS] The dimension in which you and I exist is one of an infinite number of dimensional realities. I... I don't, I don't know. I don't know if that's true or false. True or false. If there was an option for "I don't know," I would have offered it. What do you want me to say? What you believe. I don't know. Fine, um... Um, just, uh, true. Hmm. [ALARM BLARES] ♪ How should I your true love know... ♪ [ALARM BLARES] [GROWLS] ALLENDALE: True or false. ♪ By his cockle hat and staff... ♪ These other dimensions exist just nanometers away on membranes, dynamical objects which propagate through time-space according to the rules of quantum mechanics. [ALARM BLARES] EVE: I-I... I don't know. I don't... I don't even know what you just said. [ALARM BLARES] Hello? Eve, we suspect that you do. [SINGING EERIE TUNE] ♪ We're driven away to the graveyard... ♪ EVE: If it will get me home, then true. [PANTING] Good. So, Eve, let's dig a little deeper. Five years ago, this dimension in which you and I exist was infiltrated by one of our neighboring dimensions. [ALARM BLARES] During that initial exchange, we learned that this was not, indeed, the first time contact had been made between these two dimensions. That 30 years ago, a caravan from that dimension had crossed over into ours. These pilgrims risked everything in the hopes of finding a better dimension. A better future. A dimension where the sky was blue. Now... we learned that this other dimension was a lesser dimension. That these pilgrims were diluting the natural evolution of our lives as we know it. And what if I told you that the apparatus you find yourself in can be used to record a pilgrim's biometric response to a range of stimuli from that neighboring dimension? That it is the only truly accurate way to determining a suspected pilgrim's true point of origin? What would you say? I would say you don't really care what my answer is. This will just be like playing video games with your children. Just close your eyes and relax. [SCREAMING] [GASPS] [THUNDER RUMBLING] ALLENDALE: Welcome back. You gave us a bit of a scare there. What happened? You had a seizure. It's not the first time we've seen that sort of reaction. I do wish there was another less dangerous method of collecting the confirmations we require. Please give my deepest apologies to William, Jackie and Isabelle for any undue stress we may have caused. [WHISPERS]: I can go? Your tests came back negative. Conclusively. William is filling out the discharge paperwork. Just let the nurses know when you're ready and feeling up to it, and we'll have you on your way. Mm. Hey. Hey! Hey. Look who's home! Mommy! We made you dinner. You did? We used Grubhub. [WILLIAM CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] Why don't you come here. When I was... strapped to that thing... ...this is what I imagined. This is the only place I wanted to be, and now I'm here. I made it back home. Yeah. It's gonna be okay. Hmm? You're here. You're home. I don't get it. Then tell me. I'm listening. [SIGHS] They showed me things. When I was strapped to that table, they showed me this... this place, this other place. And they said they'd be able to tell if I remembered being there. Eve, it's okay. No, it's not. You remember my recurring nightmare? [ALARM BLARES] The images they showed me in that machine of that place... WILLIAM: Eve. - Baby. - EVE: Of this little girl. A little girl who looked like me. It was my nightmare. They showed me my nightmare. How did they do... How did they do that? How did they know? I don't know. William, you know when you have that feeling when you see or smell something from the past? And it makes you excited or afraid or... whatever, you don't know the specifics, but it's intense. [EXHALES] At times, when I look at the sky, I feel that. It's like I'm on the brink of recalling some memory. [THUNDER RUMBLES] What if it wasn't a dream? What if I'm from another dimension? Okay, baby. Did you hear what you just said? What if I was there? You're right about what seeing the sky invokes in you. [GASPING] It gave you away, just as I suspected. We found another pilgrim. [CRYING] [SCREAMING] [EVE PANTING] [ALARM BLARING] Who's there? Who's there? Who's... [WHISPERING]: Otto? Who is it? MOSHER: They're saying you have money. I can get you out. If you pay. Yes. Okay. I'll pay. I will pay. O-Once I get home. Help me get home, and you can have whatever you want. Hey. Are you still there? Oh. Or go to my husband. If you can. He'll give you the money first. No, wait, I don't... I'm sorry. I don't know how this works. I've never done this before. I'm... I'm-I'm a good person. I don't... Just... Please don't leave me in here. Late tonight. I can't say the time. Just be ready. Wait. Yes. Wait. Um... There is a-a woman in the main holding area. Anna Fuentes. She has to come with me. No. No. Just you. You have to. I-I can't leave her in here. Please. She has children. She... has... Oh, she has grandchildren. [WHIMPERS] Um... [EXHALES] Where's Anna? Get in. [GASPS] [LOCK BUZZES IN DISTANCE] [GROANING] Mm.

There's a wicked infection going around the infirmary on ward seven. They ain't saying nothing, so they don't have to move the prisoners. But, uh, don't go down there. [LOCK BUZZES IN DISTANCE] Hey, if you need to do that, at least put gloves on. They all died shitting blood.

Now hurry. Go. Oh, my God. [RELIEVED SIGH] MAN: Hurry up. Oh... Mrs. Eve. Mrs. Eve... I don't trust that man. Anna, we have no choice. We always have a choice. I have done this before. It is not good to take risks. You cannot trust anybody. Get the fuck in the car! No, please. No, Anna... No, please. Oh! Anna... Anna, please. Anna. Anna.

Help, help, help! Help me! NARRATOR: We are all immigrants from somewhere, be it another city, another country, or another dimension. As a child, Eve Martin escaped to what should have been a better world. A world where the skies are blue. But now those skies have darkened, and the land below them is a place she is no longer welcome. For Eve Martin, there's no passport to be stamped for passage... out of The Twilight Zone.
