 Anna is fine. I'll look after her. Have you lost yor mind? Below deck. At once! You?re finished, Tennstedt. Your captain is lily-livered, right? He shot him right in the face. - Hoffmann? - Who else? Is this all? Yes, sir. The explosion caused major damage. That?s the problem. These pieces got stuck inside the fender. We don?t know what they?re from.

 Have them taken to my office. Miss Strasser, this is a statement for the press about that woman. Forster saw her two days ago. He?s sure she?s behind the bomb attack. Please translate it. Thank you.

 Is it true you did officer training? The navy is my life. Cook! How is he? Not well. He?s still got a high temperature. What?s your name, First Watch Officer? Tennstedt, sir. What are you doing here, Tennstedt? Why aren?t you at your post? I was... Stood down. By Captain Hoffmann. And now you let the chief engineer take you home while your comrades are dying for Germany. U-612 is a disgrace to the German navy. No. The crew is brave  and works hard. The captain is a disgrace. You?ll return as a war hero. I?ll be court-martialled in Lorient. It?s the captain who should answer for his actions. I reinstate you... First Watch Officer. This is what you asked about Carla Monroe. I?ve seen plenty of bombs, but nothing like this. Whoever set this off must have been certain of Schulz?s boat arrival time. But in order to detonate the device and still have enough time to get away, they must have set a timer as close to the moment of its docking as possible. It looks like something that has been pre-manufactured. Yeah. Taken from something else. Something with a different function. From what? If we figure that out, we?re one step closer. Ah, Miss Simone! I must ask for your help again. Information about Monroe from the Spanish Civil War. A bomb in a church. I would spare you, but I need to know if it says anything about the mechanism. One more thing. I?ll post a man outside your door. He will escort you. For your safety. You don?t want me to work for you. You want to keep an eye on me. She saw you with me. I?d never forgive myself if anything befell you. Miss Monroe surely has better things to do than bother about a mere translator. I only want what?s best for you. I will be vigilant, I promise. And thank you for being so concerned about me. Call me at once if you find something. Hoffmann is not allowed to leave his bunk. Aye, sir. Tennstedt, you were ordered out of the control room. Lieutenant Ehrenberg... as the highest-ranking officer I?ve taken command of U-612, as per the authority conferred on me by the High Command of the German navy Pardon? Captain Hoffmann is clearly incapable of commanding this vessel. Any insubordination with respect to my decision will be treated as an act of mutiny. You can?t do this. Captain Wrangel, it?s an honour to serve under your command. I look forward to working with you... Chief Engineer. What?s going on? We're going after the fucking Yanks. We?re not going home. What? You can?t do that. We have strict orders. You have to obey them. Anyone who resists is to be arrested. Aye, sir. Let?s go. You can?t be serious. The key to the arms locker! That?s an order. Order? You?re not First Watch Officer. You will obey me as your superior officer. Arrest him. Are you deaf? Take him to the torpedo room and guard him until further notice. Understood? Come with me. This is a new sub. Do the propellers sing? I need a report on how long the fuel will last if we go at full speed. Captain Wrangel is going to whip this sub into shape. Can he count on the engine room? - How about Hoffmann? - Not your concern. I don?t care who the captain is. But for the record, I don?t want the firing squad for this. The officers bear the responsibility. I?ve seen a lot, but a mutiny is new to me. And what are we going to do? What we always do. Follow orders. What?s going on? What the hell?s going on? Captain Wrangel has assumed command. Pardon? Schiller, arrest Lieutenant Tennstedt and Captain Wrangel for mutiny. That?s an order. With all due respect, Mr Hoffmann, you?re no longer in command. Chief Engineer? Robert! Are you all out of your minds? Do you all want to be court-martialled? I know your father, Hoffmann. A great man. An example to us all. Unfortunately you?re not like him. You had the chance to sink an American ship, but you preferred to disappear. One of my men was on board. He was injured. And you handed him over to the Yanks. Voluntarily. What?s wrong with you? - Are you a fraterniser? - I follow orders. You realise we?re at war? In which you were a POW, Wrangel. And nothing else. Schiller... Take him back to his bunk. Mr Hoffmann. Don?t touch me! Klaus, please... go to your bunk and get better. I hope that you realise one thing. You?ll all be court-martialled for this. - Chief Helmsman. - Aye, sir. New calculation. Take us to the convoy route. We?ll attack at night. The Yanks will never know what hit them. Aye, sir. I never saw you as the type to go against the tide. Cook told me about Hinz. I can?t believe I defended that pansy. I?d have loved to go home. Ugh. That?s my bad side. You?re exposed? - What about you? - I?ve got other plans. Let?s go. Captain... How do you rate our chances? At a court martial. You?re thinking about that now? Jail, First Watch Officer. Best case scenario. What? But there won?t be a court martial. A captain who was the sole survivor of his crew and a First Watch Officer who was stood down for insubordination. That needs straightening out. Don?t you agree? There?s nothing worse than indecisiveness. But to act decisively when it?s the only way out, that requires courage, Tennstedt. Are you courageous, First Watch Officer? Yes, Captain. Good. We?ll throw Hoffmann overboard. They?re all simple sailors. They?ll do what I ask of them. Hunting dogs need a firm hand. Only then are they truly loyal. To the death. Captain... I must ask you to come with me. Act with honour, Schiller. Like you when you shot a man in the face and drank with a Jew? Shut up. - They want to kill Hoffmann. - What? - No one?s doing anything? - No. Not even Ehrenberg? Hoffmann told us to obey orders. What will they do with us? The same as they?ll do to Hoffmann. I have to take you to the control room. What?s all this about? Imagine you had returned to La Rochelle. What would you have to show for it? One dead, one injured, whom you left with the Yanks, and a boat full of torpedoes because you saved a shitty Jew. Why do you think Donitz agreed to the exchange? Because he wants to win the war. Do you think I?ll let a new, combat-ready U-boat and crew run from the enemy? U-612 is now ideally positioned on the convoy route. Under my command. You?re ridiculous, Wrangel. Captain Hoffmann, as the highest-ranking officer on board I order you to leave U-612. You will be given the dinghy and some provisions. You all know our order. You can?t let this happen. The men have nothing to do with this. I?m the highest-ranking officer on board. This is my decision. - The two other men... - Maas und Strasser. They will go with you. - Insubordination. - Because they didn?t obey you? I had stood you down. Maas and Strasser needn?t obey you. They mustn?t be punished for doing their duty. Unless Captain Wrangel wants a crew who will follow anyone who claims to be their captain. Loyalty, Wrangel... and honour. These words are probably meaningless to you. Release them. And you, Hoffmann, may address the men. I speak to you as men of the sea. Men who face death every day. I am convinced that only the following of orders will lead to success. What you?re doing is open mutiny. And you know it. All of you. I declare my faith in and my allegiance to Captain Hoffmann. Don?t talk drivel, von Haber. I?m coming with you. Max, no! No. I dropped out of officer training because I thought the really good men were here. On board a U-boat. But when I look at all of you... I can see that they accept any piece of shit. Rather than breathe the same air as you, I?ll go with the captain. Ehrenberg... Would you like to join them? Come in. These are Nathalie?s things from the hospital. Well, just her clothes. A Jewish girl who calls out your brother?s name in the night and who?s recently had a child. I'm sorry. I didn?t want to get you into trouble. If I?m at risk, I have a right to know. Did you think I?d denounce you? Nathalie and Frank have a daughter. Where is she? She?s safe for now. If you need any help, you know where to find me. Come in. Inspector... I?ve received the final list of the 100 hostages. The mayor has added comments which need translating before you approve it. Thank you. One thing about the security for Miss Strasser... It?s unnecessary. You can withdraw the guard. - Frank will return. - And if he doesn?t? He will return. I hear U-boats are being sunk all the time. Is it true there?s a list of people they?ll shoot if anything else happens? Things have changed. People act differently when they?re scared. They see a woman of my age pushing a pram. They ask questions they would never normally ask. He will return. She wants to see you. Let?s go. Careful, there?s a step. Leave us. You know him? Time clock? A card was placed between the two contacts. All he had tow to start the timer was pull it out. We had a report two weeks ago... from the iron foundry at Angoul?me. A time clock was stolen. That?s why nobody could control the working hours any more. Go on. Suspicion of sabotage. The iron foundry is essential to the war effort. I want the police report and the responsible officer. Miss Strasser! Hello, Inspector. I?m importing for duty. Where may I sit? This way. Captain? The batteries are on 80 percent. I want them fully charged. We stay on the surface. Aye, sir. Ship radio. English. Merchant vessel at three-five-zero. What a beauty. Merchant vessel at three-five-zero. Distance 2500. Here goes. I thought we wanted to attack at night. A big, fat merchant ship, Chief. We?re going to fuck this one over. Battle stations. - Battle stations! - Prepare to dive. Let?s go, arseholes. Flood tubes one to four. Out of the way! - Hatch closed. - Dive. Dive! Periscope depth. Five degrees on the bow planes. Stern, zero. - At periscope depth. - Is there an escort? Destroyers? Make ready tubes one to four. New course one-two-four. Make ready for submerged firing. Make ready tubes one to four. New course one-two-four. Make ready for submerged firing. Tube two is open. Four is open. Three is open. Tubes one to four ready. Torpedo speed 30. Enemy speed 17, angle-on-the-bow, port 80, distance 300. It?s too risky. We?re too close. The rules stipulate 300 metres minimum. Fire one, fire two. Fire one, fire two. Fire one, fire two! 6... 8. Hit. We did everything right. We got rid of Hoffmann and Max. We?re lucky again. Propeller noises. Lots of them. Everywhere. It?s hell out there. I think it?s an entire convoy. A convoy. We?ve given away our position. They?ll hunt us down. We?ve stepped into a hornet?s nest. One shouldn?t do that but when one has done it, one has to stamp them out. Torpedo speed 30. Enemy speed 16. Angle-on-the-bow, zero. Distance 500. Torpedo speed 13. Enemy speed 16. Angle-on-the-bow, zero. Distance 500. Fire three, fire four. Fire three, fire four! Reload torpedoes. Open it, Kimm. Release safety. Open it, Kimm! Move! 8, 9... Missed target. Both missed target. Quick! Propeller noises. At one-three-six. Getting louder. Enemy approaching. They?re about to ram us. We?re on collision course. We?re on collision course, sir. Maintain course. We?ll collide. We must change course! Captain! Welcome to your fate, Tennstedt. What? Don?t you realise what this is about? Immortality. Where are you going? Captain! Close outer doors. Take her down. Five-zero metres. All hands forward. All hands forward! Go, go, go! Hurry! - I need reports! - Hard to port. Where are the reports? Shit! What? Propeller noises at zero-nine-eight. Destroyer. Approaching. Amidships. Hard to starboard. Silent running. sU-Boots - submersos em guerras - Subtitles: Fred Cipriano
