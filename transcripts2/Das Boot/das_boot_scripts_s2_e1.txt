 Out there, we are on our own.  There is only one way  to survive. Together. - Nice to meet you!  - The pleasure is mine. - French?  - No, German. Simone! How long before you ship out? I am a friend of Frank's. They are fake.  Total lies. And if the Germans find out, I'm sure they would just, throw him off the boat. I would appreciate your company.

 At dinner. Tonight. Five U-Boots count on us! Tell the men to get to  their stations! Yes Sir, Commander! You will contact a ship  and make an exchange. It's concerning this man;  Mr. Samuel Greenwood. Your girl? It was then that I told him  everything. I told him that I am Jewish. Why don't you tell the truth? Father. My family, we helped arm Germany  to the teeth. I don't know which of you  is more pathetic. You, or the other guy. The one  they're .. collecting.

 - Who is he?  - Wrangel. Are you going to let it escape? They have one of my men on board. Shit to that! As the highest ranking officer,  I order you to leave U-612. I will go with you. Nothing was written  in the logbook about the Greenwood exchange. So we can write our version  of what happened. It is our pact. My God, what have we become? Margot is on the list of  the hostages. - Just as I thought.  - I loved her. You don't trust anyone. If you survive, better  make up a story. Or be prepared for the truth  to destroy you. Captain Ulrich Wrangel  reports the return of U-612. Where is Hoffmann? There is one other thing, sir. Someone here to see you.  He says he knows you. Mr. Greenwood. Cargo ship at 0-1-0, angle on the bow, port 90. Target speed 12 Knots, distance 1,200 metres. Rudder hard to port. New course, 0-3-4! Prepare torpodes 1 and 2 for surface firing. - Pull, Pull, Pull!  And Stop! Release the safety! - To the back!  - And down! And forward! Load! Load! Load! Load! Torpedoes 1 and 2,  ready for surface fire! Torpedoes 1 and 2, ready  for surface fire, Captain! Torpedo 1. Fire! Torpedo 1, fire! - Torpedo 2, fire!  - Torpedo 2, fire! 52, 53, 54, 55... Direct hit!, Captain Yeah Men!  12 kills for Falkons! Winterberg! There are far too many people. With women and children! It was not a cargo ship! There were passengers on board. We had no way of knowing. Destroyer at 8 o'clock! Alarm! Emergency dive! Diving Stations!  Prepare to dive! Coupling is disconnected! All hands forward! All hands forward! Go! Go, go go! - Move! Move! Move!  - Go, Go! Move! All hands forward! - Faster!  - 30 meter. Go! 40 meter. Diving. Go!  Faster! 50 meter. 60 meter. Diving. Depth charges! 1. 2... Depth charges!  1. 2... 70 meter. Diving. Water on the bridge! - We have to go deeper.  - No point. Sonar will detect us there too. New course? 0-0-8.  1,100 meters. Under the wreck. Under the cargo ship? Under the survivors. Both engines, slow speed ahead. They'll have to go through the  survivors to drop their depth charges on us. No propeller noise.  They've turned away. No propeller noise.  They've turned away. Well done, Captain! They'll be picking up the  survivors now. Excellent maneuver, Captain. Let's get out of here. - Silent running!  - Silent running! Come and get the last copies! - Miss Strasser. - Inspector. The mail. Today's.  FRENCH GRAMMAR You've been working on your  French in the hospital? The nurses were very patient  with me. But I'm afraid I still  have a lot to learn. There always is. Congratulations on my successful  destruction of Carla Monroe's resistance cell. And they'll like me to be  the liaison officer with the Navy in an SS operation. Would you like dictate a reply? Thanks,  I'll reply later myself. And where are you celebrating Christmas  this year, Miss Strasser? Are you going home? Here.  My home is here. I have no other. It was brave of you to return,  Miss Bostal. - I knew you wouldn't arrest me.  - Why would I arrest you? You 've done nothing wrong,  have you? - So the list of hostages was revoked.  - That's right. However, your absence was noted. I'm back. And I'm sure even Mr. Forster would agree  nurses are important to the war effort. Actually, he's been particularly  reliant on them lately. - All the same ...  - Yes, I know. I've been absent without permission  for over a month. - Your mother. How is she?  - She's well, I believe. Yes, but she fell ill suddenly  a month ago, didn't she? You had to rush to her bedside. In Marseille.  Yes; yes that's right. The hospital confirmed it  when I called to check. What her name? - Marianne.  - Noted. But no more unexplained absences. Forster is back. I won't be able  to help you anymore. Understood. Thanks you, Inspector. One last thing. Can you pass a message to one  of your colleagues? Simone Strasser. I have to see her. You moved out? 155 00:15:09,867 -t-> 00:15:11,296 Yes. Thank you. Tell me about Anna? What happened? First, I took it to my aunt, to a little village near Marseille. But soon the neighbors began  to gossip. So my aunt advised me to go  and see the nuns at her old school. Amazing women. They're in touch with the local  resistance and thanks to them they were able to put Anna  in a convent in Spain. - An orphanage.  - Good. Frank will be pleased. - Frank? He's alive?  - Yes. That's wonderful news.  Hold on ... Here. The address of the orphanage.  Give it to him. He can write to her or ... even go see her one day,  when he's able to. Margot. You've changed. You know, after everything  that happened here, everything I've experienced. The refugees in Marseille, all that suffering ... But, certainly you know what I mean. I hear that Forster destroyed  a local resistance cell. What do you know about it? The destruction of that cell, saved hundreds of innocent lives. You too. You were saved too, Margot. Cigarettes and brandy ... Frank?  Frank Strasser? He is not here. If someone sees you here,  we'll get in trouble. Frank? What are you doing here? I have good news for you. Anna is alive and safe. - What? - Yeah Where?  Is this in Spain? And this is yours too.  You've paid dearly for this. PASSPORT OF THE  FRENCH REPUBLIC I have to go there. - Yes. - I'll go to her. - Merry Christmas.  - Yes, Merry Christmas. Go to her.  You have a future, Frank. - Merry Christmas.  - Merry Christmas. First we hunt them,  and then we sink them! To Christmas, beer and tits! Cheers! What do you know about tits?  You've never seen any. They sink a few lousy cargo ships and think they rule the waves. I heard you had problems and and barely crawled your way  back to port. Oh Yeah. So why is Wrangel being awarded the Knight's Cross today? They give it to everyone these days. Uh huh.  Even criminals. What did he say? Nothing. You need more to drink, right Chief? You've got no balls, you faggot! - Come here you asshole! - Pips! - Dieter! Let me go! Only one crew can be the best, right? So ... How do we settle this? Candles. Candles. MERRY CHRISTMAS One, two, or three?  No, we will give 4 German soldiers. May I introduce myself?  We've not yet had the pleasure. - Corvette Captain von Reinhartz. - Inspector Forster. Sit down, Forster.  Join us. Thank you. Johannes was my best student  at Mürwik. You were a very patient instructor. Its success speaks for itself. 12 ships sunk with over 60,000  registered tons since September. We're just glad we made it  back here. From what I heard, after  a brilliant maneuver. Hiding the Sub underneath  the survivors of the attack. Bravo! Congratulations! Wrangel is the new face of  the submarine fleet. Yes, because that's what  Berlin wants. His last mission was very impressive. He told a good story. We need good stories. One victory leads to more  and more victories. The image of a hero inspire others to be heroes  themselves. And sometimes leads a lie being accepted as the true. Corvette Captain von Reinhartz. Corvette Captain Wrangel. Gentlemen. The whole city is talking about  you and your daring maneuver. And about your last adventure, if I can call it that. - Congratulations.  - Thank you. We all know that these small things are mere baubles. And we also know what it's  really about: kill or be killed. Quite simple, isn't it? So may I invite the new recipient  of the Knight's Cross for a glass of champagne? If you'll excuse us. By the way, I've also recommended you for  the Knight's Cross. - I don't need it.  - Nonsense! This is all a load of shit, here! Shhh. Not so loud. This morning, I saw boys barely  out of nappies boarding the U-Boats, but in Berlin they're all shouting  "Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!" They're out of their minds!  Everyone here! Maybe you should take a break. Why not visit your wife for  a few days over Christmas? I don't think that's a good idea. Johannes. I remember your wedding very well. I've seldom seen a happier  and more beautiful couple. That was a long time ago. Now she looks at me like  I'm a stranger when I go home on leave. No wonder. I don't even recognize the man  I'm looking at in the mirror anymore. Better send out again as  quickly as possible. I need to go out there while I  still can after the last maneuver. Johannes, that was a victory,  not a defeat. Hiding beneath dying women and children is  no victory and you know that as well as I do! Laudrup!  Laudrup! Come on! Come on! Finish him, Laudrup! Come on! Come on! Laudrup!  Laudrup! - Yes!  - Falkons wins 5 to 4. - Are you OK??  - Yeah. U-822! U-822! U-822! Where are you going? I don't answer to you,  Petty Officer! Anyway, I've seen enough of you  all making fools of yourself. Life goes on, Chief. Not for everyone. You wouldn't believe the  progress that we're making. The question is: Do we go for the meeting now? With the Navy, you only get  one shot. Well the plans will be ready  in time for the meeting. And, if we don't go for it now, one of our competitors is gonna get there ahead of us, Pops. Besides, don't you think it's time we kick these Nazi's butts? - What do you say, Bonny?  - If Adolf Hitler were standing there, I would slap his face,  Sir help me God. I can assure you, Mr. Roosevelt is gonna slap Hitler's face for you, but to do that, he needs a  majority in the Senate. Yes sir. And as our future senator,  you'll give us that majority. Well. I haven't officially announced yet. You should slap him in the face. - What does he do here all day?  - Give him time, alright. His engineering is a little bit rusty thanks to the war but but in U-Boot technology, he's been great. He better be. We're taking a serious risk  hiding him here. Hey, Trust me, Dad.  He is a good guy. Oh. You coming for Christmas dinner  tomorrow? Your mother asked. Yeah. I wouldn't miss it. He's calling in his friend  from the Navy. You gotta be ready with those  plans. I thought we were going  to meet this someone who could get me home tonight. Uh, That too. That was the deal, wasn't it? You scratch my back,  I scratch yours. But we gotta mix a little  bit of pleasure when we go on business. Tonight you're gonna experience  something completely different. Trust me, you're never gonna  want to go home. Heh. What are you waiting for?  Let's go! We're going up to Harlem. 110th Street. Hey Buddy. Thanks for the ride. A different world, huh? How are you? Thanks, Joe. Fred, I'm glad you could  make it. Klaus Hoffmann, this is the guy  I wanted you to meet. Frederick Berger. He was raised in a Mennonite  community in Pennsylvania. He helped arranged my recent  passage back from Europe, and I thought he could help you. A pleasure to meet you. So take it as a good sign he's  here. He hate this place. Ladies and gentlemen,  Minton's Hats Band! It's a different world, and  you're about to meet it's queen. But now, ladies and gentlemen ... Our next act... is a little bit late, this evening. So, um. Top off your drinks, make sure you add a little bit  of ice in there too, cause it' gonna get hot  in here tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Cassandra Lloyd. Now, you're late. Sorry. Sam told me about your misfortune. Your U-boat sank off the coast? Lucky, a couple of Canadian  fishermen picked you up, and not the US Navy. Yes. As you can see,  Sam trusts me. You need to as well,  if I'm to help you. Mr. Hoffmann,  It was a pleasure meet you. Call me and we can discuss  your situation. - It won't be easy.  - Thank you. I'll get in touch with you. And here she is! It's an honor to meet you. Those manners ain't from around here. Klaus is from Switzerland He's just visiting. He got ship-wrecked but he got a little luckier than  old Robinson Crusoé landing here in Minton's, huh. Thank you. So. What did you think? Oh. I thought it was ... true. Oh.. "true" What he means is "marvelous",  "fabulous". I'm sorry, Miss Lloyd, I know little about jazz. No, I like "true". And I know what it's like not being  able to get where you want to get. Well, what could be better  than this place? One of those fancy Minton places would be nice for a change. Turned down for the third time  for my "white" cabaret card. Segregation? There is no segregation  in New York. Not unless you're black. Look Cassie, I can't fix  your cabaret card, but I can fix to take you  to a nice dinner at one of those fancy  Minton places. - That might be nice.  - Yeah? And Mr. Crusoe? Um, sure.  What do you think? Klaus, you wanna come along? Yes, I'd be delighted to join you. There you are. It's settled.  Hey Cassie, the second set. Good evening, Miss Lloyd. I hope you manage to get home soon, Mr. Crusoe. But not before we have that dinner. So you tell Berger the truth  about me, but not her. We gotta be careful with  the truth. Berger has to know, because he's gonna  help you out with your situation, but.. Welcome back! others ... This ones' for all the lost  sailors out there. If we ration everything carefully,  including water, we can last four days,  maybe five. And we can last a few days without anything. We can last for at least a week. Someone will spot us before  the week is out, Captain. Have you any idea how big  the Atlantic is? Despair is our enemy, Sir. Yeah.  Just like hunger... the weather... and the sea. DEPOT  LA ROCHELLE Hey girls. Have you got a cigarette? Hey you. I'll fuck you good and hard! Hey. You're here to work, not annoy the girls. You haven't done anything yet. Give me 10 francs first. 5 now, 5 later. I couldn't give a shit about  your 5 francs. Keep it. Go fuck your shitty job! Sorry. No. I can't let you in. - Why not?  - David told me not to. I can't. Hello! Miss Strasser,  what are you doing here? I told my sister-in-law  not to let you in. It's far too dangerous. You know the 4 of you won't  survive on your  sister-in-law's rations, so have mine. Hey, children, look what I found. Eggs. Wait for Dad. - Strasser? - No. What are you doing here? I've asked you what you're  doing here, Strasser! Stop, Strasser! Strasser!  Stop, Strasser! No! It's regarding an SS mission  supported by the Navy. Top secret. Why me? In my opinion, von Reinhartz is  not just the best CO in our fleet, but also absolutely reliable. May I ask what is this mission about exactly? For now, all you need to know is to deliver the cargo at  the agreed spot. Here are the details and the maps, however, I must ask you  not to break the seal  and read the order until you've reached 20° west. This prevents any details of your  mission getting out before you set sail. Of course, Inspector. Some of my men are due leave. My First Watch ... I've already made arrangements  for those men due leave to be replaced by men from  Captain Wrangel's U-Boot U-612. I wanted to break up  the crew anyway It's not Wrangel's crew,  but Hoffmann's. Sub-Lieutenant Schiller will be  your new First Watch Officer. I should brief Schiller right away. Corvette Captain von Reinhartz, this is a vitally important mission. Not only for the SS, but also for the propaganda  and moral in Germany. NEW YORK MAP My beloved Elli. I have made a decision  that I hope you can support once I've explained my  reasons to you. In any case, it is imperative that you leave Germany immediately  after receiving this letter. I know you really well, Desjesquier. I know what kind of bastard you are. You'd sell your own mother,  wouldn't you? - She's dead.  - You'll not get a penny. Because there are no more  Jews in La Rochelle. I've wasted enough time with you.  Get lost! Get lost!  Or I'll arrest you! Do you have something for me? This came from Berlin this morning. Thanks. Who were you just talking to? Like you leg, your French has  improved a lot, Inspector. It's gotten much better. That's Anatole Desjesquier,  a local thug. And what did he want? Just peddling tales of Jews  in hiding. All he wants is money. I told him that you'd dealt  with this matter and he was insulting you personally. Mr. Desjesquier? Excuse me a moment, please. Inspector Duval told me you  had some information. Yes, but not for free. Sorry to disappoint you, but you won't get any money  for just doing your duty. If you know something, you must tell me, or I'll have to arrest you. Jews. A German woman is  looking after them. Who? Someone you know. It's probably nothing, but .. this guy claims there are Jews hiding in a cellar  in Rue de la Mer. Rue de la Mer.  I know the street. 28, Rue de la Mer. Have a unit go check it out. Aah, And .. as always, after dark. We don't  want to attract any attention. Yes. Where were you going? To see my daughter. And where is she? In Spain, Captain. In an orphanage. - In a convent.  - Spain. Orphanage. Convent. Do you take me for an idiot? His mother is dead. I'm sorry about that, but this still all looks  like desertion. I can have you in front of  a firing squad. On the other hand, it would  really be too cruel to deprive your daughter of a  father after losing her mother, regardless of how stupid  her father behaved. Besides, you weren't gone  long enough for your absence to have  been noticed, and most importantly, I need an  English-speaking radio operator for a special mission. Go! Listen. By the way, it sounds like your  daughter will be in good, safe hands. The best thing you can do now  is to stay alive. Stick with von Reinhartz. He knows what to do, and .... Go to your daughter when  the war is over. Out! Simone! Simone! Frank. I was arrested on my way  to see Anna. What .. ? But they gave me, against all  reasoning, important .... I have to set sail again today, special mission. - What kind of mission?  - I don't know. No idea. I ... It doesn't matter. Yes, none of it matters. From now on, let's take care only of the things  that are really important. And you? How much longer will you stay here? You must get away from this Forster. He will take his revenge out  on you sooner or later. Frank. My darling brother. Sometimes things are just  the way they are. Take care of yourself. - Margot Bostal? - Room 5. Margot? Simone?  What are you doing here? It was while Forster  was in the hospital. A young inspector came to  see me because while checking civil records, he discovered, that a Jewish family came here  in August from Paris after the round-ups. But there was no record  of their departure. I told him I would let  Forster know, but instead I went looking for  them and I found them staying with David's  sister-in-law. They were in the cellar,  starving. I removed their names from  the registry, and since then I've tried to give them whatever food I can find. That it. I knew you hadn't given up. And you? I'm with the resistance now. I met them when they got Anna out. They sent me back here to  establish a new escape route. So you can help me?  You can get them out? I can't do it.  I have to stay here. Forster will never let me go. I never thought I'd see you  again so soon, Sir. - Nor you.  - "Chief". Nor you, Chief. Strelitz! Strasser! Watch this! They are so desperate that  they gave me another chance. I've checked the radio, Sir. Everything is in order. Thanks, but now that Petty  Officer Strasser is here, I want him to check everything. Radio contact is absolutely essential. Of course, Sir. Our new comrades. - Torpedo mechanic?  - Yes ... First Watch Officer, Sir. Captain on board! Attention! At ease! Those of you who knows me know I run this boot with as  little hierarchy as possible. I can command her by myself. But we sail her and fight together. - As you were!  - Aye-aye, Captain! Everyone to their Stasions! - Tell me. Who are they?  - Wrangel's refugees. I heard they nearly lost  their boat. They better be more careful here while I'm on board! Do we know the orders yet, Captain? Once we've passed the Ile de Ré,  we'll head west. At 20° west longitude, I'll  open our sealed order. - Our cargo, Captain.  - Bring it down! That is our cargo? Not quite. Corvette Captain von Reinhartz! Sturmbannführer Erwin Friedel, SS. My comrades Untersturmführer  Salz and Freund. Welcome aboard... Gentlemen. We'll put you in the Officer's mess, and your comrades with the  petty officers. Second Watch Fischer! Show the gentlemen the way! Yes Captain! Sturmbannführer! May I ask you to hand over  your weapon. Our orders dictate that we must  not hand them over to anyone. Shouldn't you have received  orders not to even ask? Before you came on board, I didn't  even know what our cargo was. Then the respective levels of privilege and seniority are clear. First Watch Officer! It's here. - What's going on?  - Just do as I said. David, they're coming to get you. - You must leave before nightfall.  - Who's she? Margot, a friend.  She going to help you. Gather up your things. Hello children, we have to go. Don't be afraid. Got your things? - Yes, Miss.  - We are going. - David, you have to go now! - Be quiet David, you have to go! They're here. Go, go, go!  Margot, can you take the children? - David, you go first.  - Go out through the window! I'll be right back.  Let's go! - Come on!  - Ruth! - Simone!  - Just go! Hey, come here! Margot! Come on!  Follow me! Let's go! - They must be around here. - Hurry up. Continue searching! Regroup outside. We didn't wait for nightfall, did we? I wanted you. Only you. The Jews have escaped, Inspector. They must have had help.  Continue searching. They'll show up again somewhere. What about her?  Should I call an ambulance? Scrape her up off the floor!
