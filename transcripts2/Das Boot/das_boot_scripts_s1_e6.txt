 U-612... ...is a disgrace for the German Navy. The captain is a disgrace. As the highest-ranking officer on board, I order you to leave U-612. I'll go with you. We're on collision course. We have to change course. Maintain course. What? Don't you get what this is all about? Immortality.

 Close the outer doors! Eighty meters. Set new course, one-four-five. No more propeller noise. No more propeller noise. Have they stopped their engines? Fuck! Propeller noise! Propeller noise! In one-six-zero. Shit! They called for reinforcements. We need to take her down. Take her down, First Watch Officer. Take her down. 150 meters. Full down on the bow planes. Ten degrees down on the stern planes.

 Take her down! 200 meters! Full speed ahead! Shit! - Fire extinguisher! - Fire extinguisher! Boat is falling. All hands astern! All hands astern! Go on, move it! Faster! Come on, men! Go! Move it, move it! Go, go, go! All hands astern! Faster! Go! Move it! Go, go, go! Faster! Main bilge pump failed. Trim by air. Boat is still falling. Both engines full speed astern. Blow all main ballast tanks. Blow all main ballast tanks! Vents are cycled. Come up. Come up! Boat can't be held. - Boat can't be held. - Boat can't be held. 220 meters. 230 meters. 250 meters. The boat has touched the seabed. Which seabed? There is no seabed here. The actual water depth here is 4,000 meters. We're aground somewhere. Switch on emergency lights! We have been heard. God Almighty put his hand underneath our keel. Check the pipes. Shit. Lutzi! Cook, a cloth, quick. A cloth. A cloth? Am I bleeding? You'll have a big scar. - A scar? - Yes. Scars make good stories. Especially for the girls. They'll want to know all the details. Flooding! - Flooding! - Flooding! Damage reports! Now! Counter-leaking crew to their stations! Sir! Counter-leaking crew to their stations! Sir! Rupture in the water-cooling pipe. Give me the phase terminal. Move it! What do you want, First Watch Officer? Orders? The journey is over. Simone. In consultation with Field Headquarters, the Mayor... had to replace a few names on the list of hostages. He had to explain the new names. Please translate this for me. We don't want to execute anyone who sympathizes with us. When you are finished, please give a copy to Commander Gluck. Of course. I reserved a table at La Marée for us tonight. I expect you at 7:00 p.m. The French speaking to the French. Before we begin, please listen to some personal messages. There is a fire at the insurance agency. Catherine is unwell. Athalie remained in ecstasy. I repeat: Athalie remained in ecstasy. What about coastal patrols? Hey. We don't take orders from you, understood? You listen. She's the nurse. - How long has she been like this? - It started in the night. In the beginning I thought it was laryngitis, but normally she doesn't cry and there's a tightness round her ribs. - You've had medical training? - No, but I've been the nanny of many children in this town. But there were none I cared for as much as I care for this little angel. She needs Sulfapyridine. But we've run out. Keep her warm. Get her to drink. I'll come back to check on her tomorrow. Thanks. Thank you so much for everything. It's my job. No, it isn't. You're doing much more than just your job. Is everything all right? Yes. Take good care of yourself. She wants to see you. Tomorrow afternoon at Frank's flat. The baby. Anna. Her toes turned blue. Lack of oxygen because of the pneumonia. I'll try to get my hands on some penicillin. I'll manage, somehow. What a twisted world. I never thought I could be friends with a German. When I fell into the water... my balls were bleeding. Pieces of me got washed away. All I wanted was for it to end. I wanted to stop breathing. But I couldn't. I just couldn't. The fucking wolf inside of me wouldn't let me. And I believed in you. Did you really think it would work out between us? Flooding stopped in engine room. The Laura Ethel Bank. That's the only possibility. We're further north than I thought. A shoal, we ran aground on a foothill of this shoal. Chief. Flooding stopped in the bow room. Irrigation valves' number one and three's tubes are leaking slightly. Almost all of the rescue rebreathers are useless because of the fire. It can't be. If this is right we're already at 1,050 millibars. - We were at 980 when we submerged. - Damn it! So, air is leaking into the boat? From the compressed air cylinders? Overpressure inside the boat. And not enough air to blow the tanks. Shit. What are we going to do now? You should have thought about this beforehand, fuckers! We'll all be on your conscience! What do you want from me? - What? - Stop it, both of you! That's not helping, at all! Air pressure constantly rising. We're already at 1,070 millibars. If it continues rising at this pace we're done soon. CO2 level? From 5% on it's going to get critical. At 8% we risk falling unconscious. After that, we'll suffocate. How much time do we have, Chief? Twenty-four hours. Twenty-six tops. Shit. We need orders. Chief, you're in command. - Chief-- - Yes, I know! Every valve, every air pipe, I want you to check everything until we've found and secured the leak. After that, we'll take care of the batteries. We've got to get the e-compressor started. And then pray to God that we'll compress enough air to blow the tanks. You think that's our punishment? For what? For everything. Hoffmann. Max. Maybe Max wasn't the Jonah on board. Maybe it's someone else. If the gauge climbs past 1,500 millibars we can only estimate the pressure then. Maybe we won't have enough air to surface. Here. The air is leaking from here. Show me. Clamp. The girl in La Rochelle, you know... I didn't sleep with her. I know. You see it in the eyes if someone has already fucked. All of the bad luck. A virgin on board is bad luck, right? The way it's going here, we have at least twenty of your lot on board. You don't matter anymore. Report. Air leak secured. Well done, killer. Come on. Keep on looking. The oysters at La Marée are by far the best you can get around here. Onion or lemon? Lemon. Here you go. And then you slurp it. So? Slimy. They go best with a sip of Champagne. Cheers. They grow along the coast here? Yes. One of the many advantages of being stationed in La Rochelle. But it wasn't only for the seafood that I decided to buy a house here. And, they are fetched by boat? How many fishermen are there in La Rochelle? They could transport other things too. Of course, we can't control the coast at all times. Especially not the smaller boats. And you're not afraid? I've often wondered how vulnerable we are. Miss Simone. Don't worry about that. The navy and the army are working closely together. Gluck is personally taking care of this. But... let's not talk about work. From Paris. From Lelong. You know Lelong? The jeweler who defied the Gestapo? When told he should relocate his business to Berlin, he wrote to the Fuhrer that he couldn't produce Parisian jewelry without being in Paris. An acceptable act of French Resistance. You think you can buy me? - Simone. - I can't accept it. You constantly try to impress me. As if you wouldn't be enough for me. You, just you Hagen. Without your power and your money? Think about it. - I need to drop this off. - Nobody is there, Miss Strasser. I know. Commander Gluck needs to have this on his desk by tomorrow morning. Miss Strasser. T he... list of hostages with the exchanged names has finally been translated. I see. Criminal Inspector Forster asked me to immediately deliver a copy to Commander Gluck. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Still rising. We checked everything. Apparently not. It has to come from somewhere. Check everything again. Move it! Give me my watch back. Why would 1? It was my father's. I never met him. He was killed in war. Then he was lucky. Imagine he'd come back from war just to see your fucking ugly face. I found the leak! It's in the main pipe to the high-pressure air distributor. - You found it? - Yes. A rupture in the high-pressure air pipe. I'm on it. When you're finished, immediately check the batteries. If we're lucky, just a couple of the connectors came loose. No further increase in pressure! Wait and see. No further increase in pressure! Let's hope that the batteries haven't been damaged. The connectors are broken. We have to repair them. Gas! Gas! Gas! Chlorine gas! Get out of there! Get out of there! Out, out, out! Get out! Shit! Give me your hand. Something wrong with the batteries? Open up! - Open up! - Talk. Shit. Get me some water! Get me some water, damn it! You've been quick now. We only have those two left. The rest have melted in the fire. The Petty Officer Electrician was lucky, but he's banged-up pretty bad. The e-compressor doesn't work without power. And without the e-compressor, we can't compress air to blow the tanks. Who volunteers? I'll do it. I'll go. Forget it. You'd get stuck. I'll do it. No, you're the machinist. If something happens to you down there... If something happens down there, we're all fucked. - I'll go with you. - No, Frank. You've got a girl waiting for you. I have nobody. Pips. Thanks. Good luck. It's taking too long. - They're running out of air. - Pull yourself together, man! The cell exploded. Rescue rebreathers are useless, because of the battery acid. We're done. We're fucked. Get down there. I owe you an apology. You're right. Giving you the necklace was presumptuous and distasteful. And I'm sorry that I have used my position to get closer to you in private. Yes. We should keep things separate. Private and professional life. Who was that man? Mister Anglade. - It's related to the bomb. - How? I still have to find out. Do you think I could be of help? - During the interrogation? - Yes. - It can get rough from time to time. - I can cope. Good. And Hagen, the necklace was... it wasn't distasteful. Maybe presumptuous, but... it's beautiful. Mister Anglade is the concierge at the iron foundry in Angoulême. A time clock was stolen from your factory two weeks ago. One like this... or what's left of it. Where was the clock? A time clock was stolen from your factory two weeks ago. Where was the clock? - At the entrance. - At the entrance. Did he work that day? Was he in his porter's lodge? Were you working that day? Were you in your porter's lodge? Yes. And where is this porter's lodge? Where's the porter's lodge? Opposite the time clock. Opposite the time clock, yes. Opposite. Are you a Communist, mister? Me? No. Ask him if he's blind. Are you blind? No... no... I'll send him and his whole family to a concentration camp. On the next train. Or he can go home. It's up to him. You and your family are going to be sent to a concentration camp on the next train, or you can leave as a free man. It's up to you. A young guy needed the parts. He repairs clocks. It's a young guy who needed the parts, because he repairs clocks. Name and address. What now? Ruchaud. Here we go. Communism comes from “communis” - together. If there's one, there are more. He attended meetings of the communists until 1940. His entire family is on the list of hostages. Let's get him. If this boy built the bomb for Monroe, my investigation will soon be over. Finally, more time for my private life. I must say, Monsieur Ruchaud, your mother is an excellent host. Family and resistance don't go well together. Did nobody tell you that? Leads to a premature birth. Caused by kicks. Claude? - What are you doing here? - Where's Luc? We're fucked. He's at home. - Does he know where they've gone tonight? - Why? The Germans... Forster... we have to take everything. They can't find any evidence. Hide there. Go away! Go away! Go away! Ralf? A sip of water? The CO2 level is at 3.7%. The first men show symptoms of poisoning. It's only two contacts. We just have to connect the clamps and bridge the damn cell. One of us has to go in there. He'll die. One of us has to do it, or else we can't surface. Then we have to draw lots. Fuck that! Wolves. They'd prefer to eat each other... rather than suffocate. Everyone draws a lot. Everyone. Except Strasser and Maas. We're all responsible for this mess. I've got two children. That's my order, as the highest-ranking officer. Have I made myself clear? Power. Power. - We've got power again. - Power. Man rudder and hydroplanes. Switch on the red light. Air pressure is falling. Blow all main ballast tanks. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done... - We're rising. - We're rising. We're rising. 240 meters. 230 meters. 220 meters. 210 meters. 200 meters. Eighty meters. First Sea Watch, stand by. Seventy meters. Sixty meters. Fifty. Forty. Thirty meters. 990 millibars. Pressure balance restored. Twenty meters. Ten meters. Open conning tower hatch. Yeah! Yeah! Simone? Hagen. What are you doing here? Simone. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
