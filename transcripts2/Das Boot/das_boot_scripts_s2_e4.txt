 We're received orders that we have something to catch. One of our very own. U-822. I believe someone sabotaged  the radio. Frank is the only one who'd know  how to do something like this. Your constant denial is  unbecoming of someone wanting German Navy Petty Officer! Next, I walk into that room and  I tell them exactly who you are. You are looking for a periscope. I could kiss ya! If you don't tell us anything, I'll have to ask my colleague

 to make you talk The police interrogate! Not kill! - Forster doesn't care! - This is France! - Ruth!  - Ruth, stop! As long as he's there, we're safe. And for now, Elias can get better. Trust me! Is this what you're looking for? One measure, at the end of your shift. And Senior Mechanic Grothe here is responsible for the drink rations. What's our target? The White House? - He's sweet. - Can't blame him. - You are... - I am what? Somewhere over there is America. America...

 My aunt is in America. Emigrated just before the war. She wanted a career like Dietrich. Dietrich. What an actress. "The Blue Angel". My wife really enjoyed that movie. And what great legs Dietrich had. My aunts' weren't bad either. When I was a little kid, she used to put me on her lap, even though I was a bit  too big for that, and then she'd stroke my knee. My God, I felt an itch between my legs. Women. What does your aunt do now? No idea. Haven't heard from her in ages. I get it. What can you do, huh? She chose the wrong side. One day, we'll step on  American soil, then everything will change. That would really be something, huh. America? I thought so. How do you know this? From a message for our SS "cargo". When the radio was still working. What do they want there? Look for Winnetou? Teddy Suhren told me in the barracks how he and his men were walking around New York. In uniform.  Before the war. Not my thing. Nor is the Negro music that  the CO lets you play. Filthy pigs. Shouldn't you be fixing  the radio, Strasser? Aye-Aye, Sir. Kids, here's something to eat. Do you want some cheese? - Here you go, Elias. - I'm not hungry. Are you sure? Well? Ruth, can you try to get your brother  to eat and look after him for a moment? Thank you. He's getting worse. He needs a doctor. - I'll go to the village. - I'll go. - No. It's too dangerous. - It's as dangerous for you. Don't be crazy. You're helping Jews. Do you want to end up hanging  from a tree as well? You've two small children  and I don't have any. So I'll go, and you stay here with them. Father Michel gave me the name of the village priest. He'll help us. Good Morning. Welcome to St-Claire. - You're Father Etienne? - Yes. Father Michel from La Rochelle sent me. Ah, Father Michel. Father Michel is a good priest  and a good man. He was my confessor. He told me to come and see you if I needed help. What kind of help? I'd like to confess. Follow me. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been over a month  since my last confession. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. I've walked from La Rochelle  to St-Rémy with a sick child. Now his condition has worsened. Did you do it on purpose to harm this child? Lord, no. I had no choice. This child is would be persecuted. It's certainly not a sin  to help a human being. Maybe I should have stayed in La Rochelle. I know doctors there. Is it a doctor you need? Yes. There is a doctor in St-Rémy, but I don't think he's a wise choice for a persecuted child. There is another, but he's no longer practicing. Go to Camille's bistro and ask for Dr. Bizet. Thank you, Father. In the name of  the German government ... Germany and France are now united. The bistro? Germany recognises the suffering  of the French people. We want to put an end to this suffering. We want to begin a new era of friendship. Excuse me. I'm looking for Camille. What do you want with Camille? The priest told me that she knows where Dr. Bizet is. You hear that Bizet? She called you "doctor". Hello Doctor. I'd like... Your hooch is better than I thought, Camille. I'm dreaming that a .. beautiful young woman is  sitting at my table. So that we can help you, - we also need your help. We must all work together so that we can protect you. In this beautiful country, there are some elements that don't share our values. Communists, Terrorists, Provocateurs, Exiles and Foreigners. We need to work together to eliminate  these elements from our midst. - Hey, Grandpa, what's wrong? - Please, he's old. Eunuchs, you're the worst. Mr. Desjesquier! I'm explaining to these people that we're their friends. Forgive him, Father. He's young. Someone should show him  the right path. That's right, for sure! Young people need guidance from men like us, Father. It's my duty to protect my flock. But... we're not wolves. On the contrary,  we want to protect you from wolves. I was hoping it wasn't you ... You mean the one to arrest you? To shoot you? Forster's looking for you. You were seen escaping with  the Jews when Miss Strasser ... - Was killed by your men. - Not my men. Gestapo, Police. What's the difference. You're still protecting that family? They need to leave France quickly. So do you. You can't come back. I have to go back to them. If you need anything,  whatever it is, contact me. What made you change your mind? A dog. Leave the church alone. We need them. We need to be united  in our common faith to touch the hearts of the people. Yeah, of course. Where were you? I thought I was on to something.. False alarm. Let's go! We still got several villages on our list today. How long are you planing on staying this time, little angel? I need a doctor. And I'm no angel. There is a doctor in the village. What do you want from me, demon? The village doctor isn't  the right one for me, and I'm no demon either. What are you then? Someone with no home any more. Welcome to the club. They took away my licence after the war. They said I was mad. I was trying to patch up the tattered bodies of our soldiers, our former comrades. If I couldn't do it ... and they screamed out in pain. I put them to sleep... very gently. Forever. Tell me. Is that the actions of a mad man? I couldn't care less  if you're mad. There's a child, who's sick. And if he doesn't see  a doctor soon, he'll die. A "special" child , I imagine. Otherwise, you wouldn't have come to me. How is he? Not very well. He couldn't eat anything. Did you find a doctor? Right, let's unbutton this. You're going to take a big, deep breath. OK, breath in. Once again. Pneumonia? There is a miracle cure. The Germans have stockpiled the entire sulfamide stock for themselves. So we'll have to rely on traditional medicine. There is a root that grows locally. People here call it "lung root". I don't know its Latin name. Must I really let this drunk treat my son with this? Yes.  Because he's our only hope. You're quite right, sir, to reproach me for being drunk when your son is so ill. But this remedy it is the best one available to a French patient. - Water please. - Right away. Thank you. I want you to take this. You'll drink it all, the whole spoonful. It will do you good.  Ok? Open your mouth. That's it. And,  how long do you still need? It'll take time. Dieter is on our side, but Strelitz is not. He doesn't like the SS guys, but to be honest, he likes you alot less. I'll take over navigation control when the time comes. I spoke to the machinist's men. The ones who have no family. We've been on ten missions together. They're with us. You were right about Laudrup. We've probably got a Chief Engineer. He's longing to sit on his aunt's lap again. Never mind. But Schiller is a problem. He believes what Peter said about the radio. I know. What else? How is the crew's morale? It's been better. The SS mission, the broken radio. It's making everyone nervous. I get it. Well then.. Let's liven this place up a bit. How's the weather, Fischer? It's cleared up. Blue skies. Good chance of a sunburn. It sounds like in the Caribbean. Chief, stop both engines.  Right away. Understood. Stop both engines! What's going on? Forgive me, Captain, but what are you doing? Both gun crews to battle stations. Two additional outlooks  on the deck. Aye-aye, Captain. Gun crews to battle stations! Two additional outlooks  on the deck! Gentlemen! I ordered you out here today because today is Saturday. And in my family, Saturday is bath day. - Have you lost your mind? - What's wrong, Friedel? You've been complaining about the lack of hygiene. Strasser, music! - It's January, Captain. - We're in middle of the Gulf Stream. The water only a bit colder than in La Rochelle. We'll freeze our balls off! What are you? Cowardly Tommies? Fat Americans mommie's boys? Is this an order, Captain? It's not an order, Strelitz.  It's a test of your manhood! Who else is a true  German sailor? Shit! Why not? Take it off!  Take it off! Come on, men! What's taking you guys so long? What's this crazy fool up to? I have no idea, Storm Teamleader. They're all completely mad. Yes, totally out of their minds. Make room for Titch, you pussies! The first man around the boat get a bottle of rum! And Go! Watch your back, here comes Wilhelm! Move it! Come on! Here come the engine room boys! Don't let them beat you! Enemy plane! Enemy plane! Take cover! - Fire at will! - Take cover! Clear deck and bridge! All hands below! Help! Help! - Move it! - Help! Hold on! I've got you! Second airplane at 8 o'clock! Fire at will! All hands to diving stations! Go! Move it! Asshole! Faster! Faster! Faster! Go! Torpedo! All hands below! 20 degrees port! Schiller! Schiller, we have to get below! Chief! Prepare to dive! Prepare to dive! Depth charges. But too far away. Come below, sir! All hands on board? Petty Officer, I've asked if  all hands are on board! Aye-aye! Flood the tanks! Stop! Stop! Man overboard! Go down 100 meters. 20 on the bow plane, 10 on the stern! Man overboard!  Man overboard! Man overboard! Thank you. - Torpedo. 40 degrees. - Torpedo. 40 degrees. - Bearing fast right. - Bearing fast right. Miss. Miss. What the hell were you thinking?! Captain?! If the war was going  as we believed, as the propaganda would  have us believe, then here should be a safe zone and no attack would be possible. That there...  was military subversion. Schiller was still alive on deck. Where is he? He was hit. On his way to the bridge. I saw it happen. I'll write it all in my report. How many men have we lost? Five? Six! We should recover the bodies. We let the sea take care of the dead. Ship's at 100 meters, Captain. Both engines forward. Slow speed. Hey Robinson. What'ya doing skulking  in the shadows? I'm sorry. I didn't want to disturb you. Impressive he came all this way  out of hours to hear us. Isn't it boys? Is that one of the songs  from New Orleans? Gonna record it for posterity, that is,  if it meets with your approval. Of course. I just hope the piano in  the studio is more in-tune. Maybe it's it way I'm playing it. Wannna show me how it's done? Okay. Faster. Much faster. Much faster. Well That was too fast for me, I guess. That's okay. Let's take it slow then. All you white folks! Please leave! The club is now closed! White people out...! Let's go! I need to find out! Get outta here! Let's go! Let's go! White people out! Come on! I'm not getting off this stage! You don't have a warrant to get ..! - White people out! - I'm not getting off this stage! What' wrong? And why was she arrested? - I- I don't know. - Then just go see Sam. He's got the money  to pay the bail, he likes this ...music. That's not what this is about. You know Sam and Miss Lloyd  are very close. You mean..  she wants his money and he wants to fuck her? But he is Jack Greenwood's son. - People will start to talk ... - Stop it! We both know why you're here .. you want to test me. You don't think I'll be able to get your black whore out of jail. What? No. You are just like Sam.  You think I'm just a small-time,  sleazy lawyer. I don't think that. But who do you go to when  you're in trouble? - When you're up to your neck in shit? - It's not like that. You brought Sam back to America. - It certainly wasn't easy. - It wasn't! But I made it possible. Nobody else could have done it. Never forget that. I can make things happen! May I help you? I'm here to pick up ...  Miss Cassandra Lloyd. Wrongly detained, I believe. Huh, Really? And who are you? Frederick Berger,  Attorney at lawyer. I'm not acquainted with your  Superior, Chief, but ... Thomas O'Leary, Chief of the  Midtown Precinct is a personal friend of mine. Might I ask what your interest in Miss Lloyd might be? I have no personal interest. Kindly show this card to your Superior. O'Leary is a police officer? A very respected big shot. And he know who I am. You alright? I've played better joints, I've also played worse. We'll have you in a cab to uptown  in a minute Miss. Thank you, Mister ...? Thank you anyway. - Shall I see you home? - Yeah. I'm sure Miss Lloyd is perfectly capable of finding her own way home. See you around, Robinson. Sam is a rich, spoilt fool. If he wants to have a Negro whore,  that's his problem. You are a German soldier! If you want me to do my duty as a soldier, - then get me back to Germany. - Do you really want that? Of course. Good. Then I'll help you. But first, help me. What do you think it would mean for the U.S. Navy if we destroyed their Naval Academy in Maryland and then the Marine Base in Carolina? What do you think the strategic  impacts would be? The damage caused would be devastating. The east coast would be unprotected, against our U-boat fleet. The commanders of the new fleets  the Americans are currently building would be wiped out. But how do you plan to do that? An air strike like Pearl Harbor? Three men .. and a suitcase of dynamite. I need your expertise. I don't understand. In a few days, a German U-Boat will reach the coast of Maine. We'll both be there to meet them. And when all goes smoothly,  then this U-Boat will take you, as a hero, back to Germany You're in contact with Berlin? Like I said, I have my connections. With deep sadness, we pay our respects to our fallen comrades. We swear that their sacrifice ... We swear that their sacrifice ... It is customary to say that  their sacrifice was not in vain. But maybe it was. Just like all those who already  lie at the bottom of the sea. And all those who will follow them. Simply, all for nothing. Damage report, Chief? Fortunately,  only superficial damage. They didn't hit the hull. The diesels should be able to run at full speed. Only the batteries  are giving problems. What problems? I charge them up  and they discharge immediately. Seems distilled water is leaking. Can you fix it? Yeah, with more distilled water. With a lot more distilled water. Latest reports, say there's a supply ship in quadrant Caesar Bruno 95. We can't stop and we definitely can't go back. - It would endanger the mission. - We have to. Then we'll get spare parts for  the radio and we can refuel. Get the crew down here. Set course for the quadrant. Aye-Aye, Captain.  How will we contact the supply ship  without a long-range radio? We'll have to try on VHF for that. When you contact the supply ship  by VHF, arrange a meeting point. Captain, is it really necessary? It would be too suspicious if we didn't. Tell them that our codename is "Scorpion". But that is U-612's codename. When they see us, they'll report  immediately to Lorient. They'll be ordered to stop us. Then we must stop them from doing that. Captain! A cylinder in the port diesel engine is making strange noises. We need to dive,  so I can check it out. We're too slow under water. We need speed if we want  to catch up to von Reinhartz. - But we can't ... - We'll stay on the surface! Anything else? Is it that time again, already, Chief? That's all you get. Your reflexes are still working well. Now drink. Thorsten! Hurry up! The boys want their turn too. Give it here! What's up with you? We will win this war. Because we have to win this war. Because, there cannot be any doubt about the fact that freedom will always prevail over the oppression  of dictatorship. And, I say this,  not without some pride. Because we at  Greenwood Commercial Ventures, have succeeded in creating for the Air Force and Navy the technology to win this war. Sorry, Father.  If I may interrupt. We're only just now  developing the prototype, and If you don't stop talking about it, we’re gonna have to shoot everybody here. Alright. Alright. I'll stop. But not before thanking you, Sam, because without you, none of this would be possible. I underestimated you for  a long while. Too long. Ok, Pops. Ok. Why don't you tell all these people what they really wanna hear? Huh? Will you? Or will you not? Alright. Okay. Yes I will do it. I hereby state my intention  to run for the Senate.  Congratulations, Dad! My greatest achievement  of the evening. Sneaking her in right under  my father's nose for his election party. I never though her and I would be able  to be in the same room as the old man. Cheers! You shouldn't have interrupted. He wanted to praise you. Fathers don't often do that. I know, but his way of praising  people makes me sick. It's a way of praising himself. Besides, We're not there  with the radar testing yet. I don't want someone else  to beat us to it. She really is the prime article. I do love her, you know. So why don't you introduce her to your father? You know. As the future Mrs. Sam Greenwood. Oh. That's funny. He against segregation. He says it in every speech. Yeah. Well there are limits. Would you marry a Jewish girl? I would marry the woman I loved. Really? Sam! Here. That was beautiful. See? Theo. Someone was listening. Why did you agree to sing here? We owe Sam. He's paying us well. Got a dress. - But you obviously hate it. - I don't hate it. I mean, how's it gonna  advance our lot  if I turn down the chance  to play events like this? That's just a self-imposed form  of segregation. Do I like? No. I hate it. But, I sang my song. Done my duty. Not that anyone listened. Apart from you. You wanna get outta here? One-and-only chance. I'm off to New Orleans in the morning. Who knows after that? Stardom? Of course,  after the war, we're gonna have to finally deal  with the excessive bureaucracy, And, I think some moderate  tax cuts for high end earners should, provide some real  incentive for industry. Don't you agree, Don? Hey! Come on! I want to  introduce you to Senator Corbin. Harlem. You won't get this smell in Bloomingdale's, but if it was sold in bottles, I'd buy it. You afraid  of my black brothers? You'll take care of me,  won't you? Depends on how you behave. I still wonder. Why the raid on the club? Because it's doing well. Precinct Chief figured Joe was  good for another thousand a month... Joe didn't figure he was ... so ... - So? - So. I guess he does, now. Care for a dog? - Hey. - Hello. - Two hot dogs, please - Si. Si. But that's not why you're brooding, Robinson. What's up? - It's nothing. - Come on. I saw you back there. Something eating you right up. I helped Sam with his radar. So? That's good. - Could lead to many deaths. - Yeah. Of Nazis. Of Germans.  Not all Germans are Nazis.  Not by a long way. So, they're not your people. I'm just saying, not every German is a Nazi. But the others,  the non-Nazis, don’t stop them, so there is no distinction. - Here you go! - Thank you. Thank you. Have a good evening! Why did you help him if you didn't want to? I felt like I didn't have a choice. - Didn't you? - I don't know. Maybe I wasn't prepared to accept  the consequence of refusing. That's how we find ourselves  in chains, fear of consequences. The only consequence I feared was I wouldn't see you again. Get some meat on your bones...  Go wait in my room. It's just there. How was the party? Great. They loved it. You only lying to the Lord! Not my old lady. I'm just renting. I know they use this room when I'm not here. You should get yours off too. It's not that warm in here. I must tell you something. I'm not... You're not what? Robinson. I don't know who I am anymore. From the moment I arrived  in America, I was desperate  to go back home. But now... Something's changed. I have changed. And I wish I could tell you. Why don't you? I can't. That's okay. We agreed on taking it slow. LANDING SITE JANUARY 12, AT NIGHT
