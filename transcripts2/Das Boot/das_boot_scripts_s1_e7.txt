 I'll send him and his whole family to a concentration camp. On the next train. Or he can go home. It's up to him. The Germans... Forster... we have to take everything. They can't find any evidence. We've got to get the e-compressor started. And then pray to God that we'll compress enough air to blow the tanks. One of us has to go in there. He'll die. One of us has to do it, or else we can't surface. What's wrong? You've got to go. My landlady will come home soon.

 - She has been working night shift. - So what? She can't find you here. Unfortunately, it's just coffee substitute. Thanks. I'll get you real coffee. My landlady, she's on the list, too. I see. And as we... as we're friends now, her and I, I thought... You know the situation, Simone. Field Command Headquarters signed off on the names and I can't do anything about it. Even if I wanted to.

 Don't worry. Once we've caught Monroe, everyone on that list will be safe. It won't be long now. Simone, I love you. Hagen, I... The house, this house that I bought is way too big for me on my own. All right, I, I don't want to push you. I wouldn't want to be with a woman who's easy to get. I've got to go. - Yes. See you later. - See you later. What happened to him? Flash fire. Tried to weld a leaky U-boat diesel tank. What is it, Mr. Duval? I've got work to do. We found that last night. In a Résistance hideout. It's old stuff. It's expired. Don't get me wrong. I'd like to avoid further violence. I assume you know about the list? 100 hostages. The consequences would be terrible. The guardian angel of La Rochelle. Do you smell this, Mr. Duval? That's the smell of death. People die in here. Every day. And you know why? Because the Germans are at war with the whole world. We treat them nevertheless, even if we're short of everything here, especially morphine. That's why I assure you that this is not from here. That's what you wanted to ask, right? I'm just fulfilling my duty. Yes. We all do. Unfortunately. Keep it and give it to him. He needs it. Criminal Inspector? We managed to identify the other two dead bodies. One of them is French. Claude Martin. Worked at the naval base docks. We found this inside the house. Last night, they came from western direction? Yes. Where does that road go? Along the coast. The depth charges damaged the saddle tanks. How long will the fuel last? For one day. Tops. We can't use all of it to avoid piston seizure by running on empty. What about the batteries? They're fully charged. We should talk. We're somewhere around here. But we don't know the exact location. No positioning is possible; the sun is not coming through. What about the receivers and transmitters? Pile of scrap. And I'm not able to repair it without the right spare parts. We have the VHF device but it's useless out here. And if we dive? I could try to locate with hydrophones. Maybe we'll find another ship. And pray that it's one of ours. We could only bump into convoys around here. And then what? Want to surrender? I don't want to surrender. Or continue fighting. The only thing I want is to get home. Oh yeah, that's very important. They'll detain us immediately and then put all of us in front of court-martial. All of us. Are you going to tell them? What? What happened here? Nobody knows, apart from us. The guys in La Rochelle have no clue. The logbook... nothing has been written in it since Greenwood's exchange. Yes. So we can still write in it what happened. But we have to get home first. And how do we do that? Without fuel? No idea. We would have to find a German ship first. Submerged running. Until we're far enough away from the convoy routes. How far will we get with running on the batteries at 3 knots? 180 miles. A course in south-eastern direction. That would get us at least a bit closer to the French coast. Set new course one-three-five. Rig ship for dive. Simone. Is she upstairs? No, but... I know where she is. Could you hide her? Outside of town? At my farm. But not forever. She has to leave La Rochelle. How? There are soldiers everywhere. I'm scared. Me too. You came here by car? Come with me. We've got to stick together now. Chief! It won't work if the officers won't keep their mouths shut. Then we could stay out here. Maybe we should just face what we did to Hoffmann. - And Max. - Would it bring them back to life? No. But at least some backstabbing bastards would hang for it. But you don't have to worry. I'll keep my cowardly trap shut. If Wrangel doesn't play along you can forget about it anyway. Frank. Frank. Listen. Knocking noises. SOS. Bearing? 45 degrees. Moving to the right. You can clearly hear the signal? Yes. It's slowly getting louder. Battle stations! Battle stations! Come on, you lazy bastards. Move it, assholes. Hey! Killer! What's wrong with you? It won't work out as long as I'm on board. What? I'm just bad luck. Because you're a whore cheater? A whore cheater? Someone who pays but doesn't fuck. That has nothing to do with our bad luck. And now do your job or else you'll get fucked. By me. Nothing. The signal grows louder. It could take forever until we find it. Like a needle in a haystack. Kilometer 223,5, near Royan. That's the direction the car came from. Half an hour of peace and quiet. Without patrol boats. A delivery across the sea? Yes. Explosives and weapons. Who has this information, apart from you? The routes of the coastguard are changed every week. That's the task of the French. French coastguard. I always get a copy. I hope we'll find the traitor amongst them. More losses? Yes. Three boats sunk, one's missing. Hoffmann. Lorient received the last message four days ago. Silence ever since. Miss Strasser deserves to know. Losses are not within my duties. Oh, Forster. I'm not stupid. I know that your reasons for choosing that boat weren't entirely professional. You should be the one to tell her. Simone? We have to talk. Yes? About what? Not here. Tonight, at my place. All right. My driver will pick you up. See you tonight then. How are you feeling? I'm okay. I gave you something. Probably a bit too much. You've slept like a baby. Carla. - It's over. - No. Emile! On my way. The whole of France? Claude and Luc are dead. We've got about 40 bullets left. So, what are we supposed to accomplish with that? I need to take a leak. Help me, please. Who is this woman, Emile? She's just a friend. The woman speaks English. I don't want people in my house who speak English. You hear me? I know, Dad. A vessel. An old ship. No speed. Not very seaworthy. Make ready tubes number one and two for surface firing. Make ready tubes number one and two for surface firing. Rig ship for surface. Cyrillic characters. It's a coastal ship. Apparently no living soul on board. So far out? Maybe they're all dead. We need fuel. We have to board. Do any of you have experience in close combat? Have any of you ever killed a man? With your own bare hands? Yes. I did. Does anyone speak Russian? Apart from me? I'll go with you. What? You need me there. A mad man? Who else is going to lead the men? You? This boat needs a Captain. Otherwise, the fuel won't help you. And Ehrenberg, he'll crack during the first interrogation of the submarine command. We have no choice. Have you lost it? No. He's right. Otherwise we're all going to be court-martialed. The entire crew. I promise you one thing, if you try to fuck with us, it won't be a Russian bullet in the head for you but a German one in the back. We can go downstairs here. You stay here and watch our backs. You too. Don't shoot. Please. Don't shoot. - You're German? - Yes. - Banat Swabian. - On a Russian ship? We're in trouble. Walk! Gentlemen, welcome aboard the Kasak. I am Captain Martin Chafroff. You're all German? 2 Germans, 4 Romanians. And a souvenir from the Ukraine. That's the whole crew? It's a small ship. Why are you hiding down here? We're not hiding. We're lying dead on the water. Our machinist went mad. Drank too much schnapps. Shot at the engine. We tried to repair it, but... The starter machine is probably broken. Where is he now? Dead. Can you repair the engine? How much fuel do you have? Enough. Did you run out of fuel? That pretty much sums it up. My machinist will get your engine running and you'll give me the fuel I need in return. Take a look at it. And you go with him. Schnapps? We're lucky that you found us. Get out of the way. Shit, what the fuck? So? Can you repair the engine? I can try. Did you hear that? No, I don't hear anything. Listen. I've probably been standing next to the engines for too long. Thorsten. Thorsten. Thorsten, what are you doing? I'll have a look. Wrangel told us to stay here. Thorsten. I won't hurt you. Everything is all right. I won't hurt you. I promise. Halifax, that was our destination. Canada? Yes, east coast. There are German speaking communities. As Germans you could all fight for Germany. We are refugees. Deserters. Survivors. It's all my fault. It's all my fault, you know? All of the bad luck on board. It's all my fault. I've had enough of the war. Should I tell you some stories about the war in the east, my friend? - Have you been there? - Yes. Charkow. 57th Army? Gorodnjanski. Good man. Made our life hell. Podlas was the Commander of the 57th. Not Gorodnjanski. You've never been to war. Check on the others. Take him on deck. And then prepare for refueling. You, with me. And you too. Our daughter is there. Have you seen a girl? Jews. A girl, a beautiful girl, with blonde hair? No? Please. Shoot us. Just two bullets. We gave all our money. To take us to Canada. Please. Thank you. Thank you. Give the signal. Both engines slow ahead. Maybe it was me. Maybe I was bad luck. Come with me. Tube number two. Fire! Your plan for getting the men home safely. You can trust me. Yes. Let go. Let go! I can't take care of her anymore. It has been long enough. Take her with you. Or I'll leave her in front of the hospital. A baby and an old woman. Visited first by one daughter and then suddenly by a second one, who look nothing alike? The neighbors already talk. Why should I take risks and you don't? Give me more time. I will find a solution, please. Two days. For the child's sake. Not one day more. All right. May 1? Please, take a seat. Simone. There are things that only a friend should tell you, a... person who loves you. Maybe that softens the hard things. U-612 is missing. Hoffmann's boat. Frank's boat. They had to engage in battle. Four days ago. Ever since there has been no contact. I'm so very sorry. Will you excuse me please. They've kidnapped Gluck. I've got to go. I have no choice. My driver will take you home whenever you want. I can't replace your brother, but I'll always be there for you. Margot. You have to go. What? What do you mean by "You have to go"? They will round up people. The hostages. You're on the list. What? Listen carefully. This is a false passport. Take it. If you change your hair you'll look like her, you'll see. It'll work, all right? And you'll take the baby. Anna. You'll take her with you. Why? Frank is dead. What about you? I can't leave. I can't go. But you can. You can! I want every single stone to be turned over in that town, every door to be opened, every cellar to be searched. You all know the standard procedure in such a case. The Field Commander received the corresponding orders from Paris half an hour ago. So, let's round up the hostages. Dismissed! Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
