 Full down on the bow planes. Stern, down 10 degrees. What bearing! Propeller noise at one-one-zero. Getting louder.  Probably a destroyer. Take her deeper, Chief. Full down on the bow planes.  Stern, zero. Depth charges! All compartments, report on damage. Pump out bilges. Maintain this depth.  Silent running. Second propeller noise at  three-five-zero. Approaching. Depth charges! Dozens of them! Our Father which art in heaven,  hallowed be thy name.

 Thy kingdom come,  thy will be done on earth... Porr bastards. What do you mean? Fuck them. Hey, a little respect. I got respect for one thing. Me being alive up there  and them being dead down there. That?s what war is. Documents. One moment, please. - Where are you travelling to? - La Rochelle. Heil Hitler. Simone Strasser? Yes. Margot Bostal? It's not locked. First floor. Thank you. If you don?t like it,  complain to the Germans. They billeted you here. No smoking.  No male visitors. I expect you to be tidy. As do I. I brought you something. Soap from Pasris. Thank you. Why do you speak French so well? I was born in Alsace. If you're home, leave the door unlocked. If not, lock up. I have to go to work. Wich hospital do you work at? There's only one, just near here. There?s some bread in the kitchen. Thanks. In summary,  the actions of the accused, Petty Officer Joachim Weissgerber, amount to an act of cowardice  in the face of the enemy. This is a sworn statement in your capacity as First Watch Officer on the mission in question? Correct. Then the case against the accused has been clearly made by an officer. Do you have anything to add? We were under attack. They say that that?s when  your training will kick in. But that didn't happen for me. We came under fire and I hid. I failed myself and my comrades. I disappointed them  and I am sorry. Your cowardly behaviour is in direct opposition to our fight for the final victory. The regulations of the German navy are unambiguous. I hereby sentence you  to death by firing squad. The hearing is closed. CaptainHoffmann,  may I also take this opportunity congratulate you on your  promotion to commanding officer. Your father must be very proud. Congratulations. Thank you. Simone! Get a room. She?s my big sister. Idiot! - I?ve missed you so much. - Me too. They moved the transfer forward. I thought I?d surprise you. And you? You look tired. There?s a lot to do. I?ll show you around. Amazing! It is indeed. It's so... huge! Yes, seven berths, and those three will soon be put into service. The roof is seve-metre-thick reinforced concrete. It?s hard to imagine... What?s it like to be on a U-boat deep under the sea? 40 guys, no shower, one shithouse. Do you want to know more? This one sails tomorrow. Is something wrong? Is it something I said? No... Things are difficult  at the moment. It?s not important. Forget it. Really. I...  have to report to headquarters. Come and find me later and we?ll have dinner. When? I?m off duty at 7. Right. Simone! I?m really glad you?re here. I?m glad too. See you later. Eleven submarines in one month. do you think the British are listening in? I really don?t think so. Enigma is the most secure  cipher machine in the world. By the way, it?s now twelve  missing submarines. U-113 is missing? Wrangel? Last radio contact was over  three weeks ago. Shit. The production of new submarines is running flat out. The problem lies more  with recruiting new crews. Soon we?ll only be able to fall back on greenhorns or war-weary veterans. Come in. Hoffmann. Reporting for duty, Commander. Allow me to introduce Inspector Forster from the Gestapo. Pleased to meet you. Inspector, this is Captain Hoffmann. Are you related to that Hoffmann? I'm his son. And you?re commanding one of  the new submarines? Brand new captain,  brand new submarine. And the crew has been newly  assembled. In my opinion, an ideal combination of years of experience and youthful enthusiasm. Your logbook. That is where your heroic story  will be recorded. Hey! Why is this taking so long? - It?s not that easy. - Come on, hurry up. Why is this only being done now? I?ll tell you. The foreign workers aren?t assembling the subs properly in Kiel. And this mess is the result. By the way,  thanks for putting in a word for me. Your fitness for service  was never in doubt. We need good men like you.  Good to have you back. Good to be busy. Departure on schedule,  Second Watch Officer? An electrical problem in the radio room. You?ll inform the captain? When I see him. Sir, I speak for the whole crew when I say that you will one day  make an excellent captain... Leave it be. I was asked to bring this. I?d be pleased to meet with you  again next week. Commander Gluck? May I introduce Simone Strasser,  the new translator? Pleased to meet you. Likewise. - You?re French? - No, German. Really? May I? When I was born, Alsace was German. And now it?s German again. Shall we forget  the last 22 years? you should ask my brother that. Why your brother? Senior Radio Operator  Frank Strasser. Four combat missions, wounded,  holder of the U-Boat War Badge. Pretty good for a Frenchman,  don?t you think? Touch?. Welcome, Miss Strasser. My adjutant,  will show you to your station. Follow me, please. Stow the stuff exactly according  to the plan. The sub must be perfectly  balanced at all times. Veer away... Veer away... Petty Officer Ralf Grothe, electrician. I?ve been transferred here. Pips, diesel engine off! - Where are you from? - Windhoek. Africa? Really? - Have you ever fucked a Negress? - Yes. - Really? - Yes. Really. At the corber of Rue Pernelle  and Rue Aufredi, behind the church. - a woman. - When? Tonight. Shortly before 10 p.m. Be on time. Give her what was agreed  and take what you asked for. It?s bad timing. Could you move it  to another day? How do you think it works? I'm just the messenger.  They set the rules. I?m sure that's hard  for a German to accept. Either you?re there  or the deal?s off. Goodbye, sir. How old are you? 17 years, 2 months and 6 days. For fuck?s sake,  we have a baby on board. Don't worry, Thorsten.  We?ll look after you. So, lads, let?s slide it into that tight little hole. Like me with my cock tonight. But yours isn?t so big, eh? And nor are the holes. Shut the fuck up  and get on with it. - Release the safety! - Safety off! Move it! - Secure it. - Secured. Okay, forwards. Make way. Hermann; Take a swig. I got it from that crazy farmer. 60 proof. It will make you go blind. Peter, take a swig. No, thanks. - How is it looking? - Firearms all accounted for. - Lock and secure firearms. - Yes, sir. Latest weather report? Heavy fog tonight,  but stiff north-westerlies. It should clear by morning. All torpedoes checked  and loaded, sir. Good to see you again. Likewise, Josef.  Report for duty at 6 a.m. tomorrow. - Oh, cook has something for you. - Great.. Coming up! The engines are running smoothly.  Puts me in a good mood. - Has the captain shown up yet? - He doesn?t Have to. It?s my duty to prepare  the vessel. Just one?  What if I want to do it again? Then don?t take it off. Don?t lose it. You?ll need it tonight. Against infection. I knew a guy, helmsman on U-491,  unfortunately already dead, he picked up something the night  before we sailed. The itching got so bad,  he took a cheese-grater to it. No... It?s a true story. Something you need to know, tiger. It?s bad luck to have a virgin on board. You have to blow y our load tonight. Come on, lads.  Let?s christen the sub. They?ve got to break  or it?s bad luck. Prepare soundings! Prepare soundings! Soundings! Soundings! In... zero! Shit! Fire extinguisher! I?ve come to apologise. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe you shouldn?t have  made a statement. I felt better once  I admitted it. If the submarine had been sunk, no one would have known, right? No one would have known  whose fault it was. If the submarine had gone down,  I?d have died a hero. Tomorrow morning? Of course. Is there anything  I can do for you? That?s my mother?s address. Could you write to her  that I took it like a man? It will have to be rebuilt  from scratch. I need new parts.  It will take at least 24 hours. You?ll do it tonight. Sir, that?s impossible. Give Muller a list. He will also get your personal effects. My effects? You?re assigned to the radio room for this mission. With immediate effect. If I may, sir, is there no one  else who could go? The chief petty officer is in  hospital with severe burns. Your orders are to replace him.  Or should I have you arrested? No... Good. Tell him where you sleep. The submarine will sail on time tomorrow. With you and a functioning radio. Sir, might I ask... Could my sister bring me  my effects? She just arrived today.  She works for Commander Gluck. It would help me with  the work if she... I?m sorry. The radio operator is not to leave the vessel. - a woman will bring his effects. - But... Spare me the superstitious  nonsense. Just make sure she doesn?t distract him from his work. - Have a good evening. - You too. Miss Strasser... I haven?t really introduced  myself. Criminal Inspector Forster. Good evening. Your first day  and you?re the last to leave. No wonder your boss in Paris  was reluctant to let you go. Oh... You must have read  my file very carefully. I read all files. Bad habit. I told Gluck that it would be a crime if you were wasted on mundane work. Ah, thank you very much. Well, consider it my attempt at  an apology. For what? For making you think I questioned your loyalty to Germany. Maybe my loyalty is so great because I grew up in Alsace and I could only admire Germany  from a distance. As a German, I always felt  like a stranger in France. That won?t happen here. Miss Strasser? Sorry. - Yes? - It?s about your brother. Yes? Is that what firing a torpedo  feels like? Does it feel like fucking? That?s right. At least afterwards. You bastard.  Stick it inside her! Already have. There he is. Come on, tiger. Go get her! Just follow your dick! I want one too. Thank you. Keep the change. Thanks. - What?s your, name? - Nathalie. Pretty name. It suits you. A beer for my comrade. ?Comrade.? That?s what it?s all about.  Team spirit. Have you been upstairs? For money? Not really my style. - are you a faggot? - No. Why? You speak French,  you don?t like to fuck... Been castrated? Hey, why did you pick that one? Better a bird in the hand than two without a bush, you dickhead! Cheers! Are you still in? Show me. Nice game. You lousy fucking cheat. Call the police! Call the police! Come in. Sir, U-612 is ready  for scheduled departure. Any problems? None. A splendid vessel. I was wondering if you?d like  to join some of the men, as is the tradition on  these occasions. Tradition is overrated. Other captains have felt it helps morale if one is visible. I'm sure the men prefer to do  their drinking and whoring alone. Wouldn?t you? But we can have a drink together, First Watch Officer. Cognac? Thank you. Don?t tell anyone, but l've never read the whole thing. I was just trying to make sense of Paragraph 15. ?During an attack, situations may  develop which appear to be hopeless. ?Only if the captain, unrelenting towards himself, overcomes this feeling, ?will he be able to succeed.? An important passage. If the commanding officer really  believes a situation is hopeless should he risk  the lives of his men? Hopelessness is not a fact, but a state of mind to be overcome. The key element is  ?unrelenting towards himself?. How is your father?  I hope he?s well. He?s soldiering on. I first read his book as a young man. It?s been an inspiration  through my career. How long have you been in the forces? Since '37. I don?t have your experience. But you?re in command. It?s your submarine. Good night, sir. Frank? Simone? They say you?re sailing tomorrow. Is that true? Come with me. I brought your records. - the records? Thank you. - I thought you?d miss them. I?m screwed. I have to go,  otherwise I?ll be court-martialled. There?s something I need you  to do for me. Tonight. 42 Rue Pernelle, on the corner of Rue Aufredi, behind the church. Towards 10 p.m. a woman will come. Give her this. There?s an envelope inside. She?ll give you  something in return. Take it to my private apartment  at this address. But not in uniform. Only in civvies. Is it something illegal? Tell me it?s nothing illegal. It?s about my life,  about all I have. I?d do it myself if... Christ! What?s that? Sir... Senior Radio Operator Frank Strasser. My sister Simone Strasser. You know that women have  no place on board, Strasser? Pleased to meet you. I just brought my brother  his things. I was assigned at short notice to do repairs and join the mission. There was a fire  in the radio room. A fire? Yes, this afternoon. The captain is right. It?s bad luck to have  a woman on board. Take care of yourself. Can you fix it? I think so. Well then, see you tomorrow. He said you were cheating. I don't understand a word. He said you are cheating. - Take him away. - Sir... You?re French, me German.  I sail tomorrow. I got information... good for police. What? Sorry. I was wondering if you could  perhaps get hold of... some coffee, sugar  or even some cigarettes. No. Circuit diagram of  on-board radio set Impossible. I?m not asking for a pardon, I?m asking you to suspend the death penalty. Why didn?t you do that during the trial? The opportunity didn?t arise. - But I feel responsible. - And rightly so. This man will be shot tomorrow  because your statement condemned him. As an officer and now a captain, you must learn to live with that responsibility. That is the power invested in you  by the German navy. And what of my power to help him? To save the life of a fellow crewman? Hoffmann, why question your own conduct? Why now? Because my crew probably think the only reason I got promoted is because... Because you what? Because I?m his son and I?m expected to be like the legend, and not because of who I am. What if I?m not the person  everyone expects me to be? Hofmann, Germany needs you to be like him, precisely because of who you are. There?s no room for self-doubt  if we want to end this war. End it? This morning it was still about  winning it. The boy will die tomorrow. If it helps you understand  who you have to be, then his death won?t be  meaningless. Who are you? I?m supposed to give you  something from Frank. I don?t know a Frank. You have something for me? You have something for me. Give it to me! Stop! Police! Stop! Stop or we?ll shoot! We can?t see them. There?s someone over there. Stop! What are you doing here? Working. You either pray or confess  your sins. Do you want to confess your sins,  Pierre? Come quickly. You need to go  before more police come. Crew! Attention! For the report to the captain,  eyes left! First Watch Officer Tennstedt reporting. Crew assembled for inspection. At ease. We are men of the sea. That means that we have to confront not only the elements but also the enemy. Out there we?re on our own. Gentlemen... The submarine is brand new. We will test it. And it will test us. And in that test,  be aware of the man at your side. As there?s only one way  we will prevail. Together. Take her out,  First Watch Officer. What kind of fucking speech  was that? Crew! Attention! Harbour stations! Harbour stations! So we meet again, snitch. She wasn?t at the meeting place. I waited all this time. Go back. Find out where she is. Last beacon. Let?s see how she does below. Prepare to dive. Prepare to dive. coming down! The radio room and equipment were severely damaged yesterday. You failed to report it. The situation was under control. Then why did you replace  the radio operator? I didn't deem it necessary to... There was a fire on board  and you didn?t tell me. I don't care how many years of service you have, but this is my submarine. I won?t tolerate it again! Understood? Yes, sir. Conning tower hatch closed. Rig buoyancy vents... Aft buoyancy vent rigged. Central and bow vents rigged. Buoyancy vents rigged. Flood the tanks. Dive to 30 metres. Bow planes, ten degrees down.  Stern planes, five down. Good morning, Miss Strasser. Your second day of work  and you?re late? I slept badlv. I see. Would you come with me, please? Why? I need your help. This used to be the customs house. Now we share it with the French. Please... Mr Duval, this is Miss Strasser. Mr Duval is with the  French police. He didn?t get much sleep either. Come with me, please. I know this is not part  of your normal duties, but there was an incident last night, probably related to the black market. Normally Duval takes care of these things but a French police officer was shot. He?s not neutral enough  for my liking and my French still isn?t what it should be. It shouldn?t take long. subitles: sU-Boots
