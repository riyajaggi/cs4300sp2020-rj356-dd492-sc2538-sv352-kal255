 I?m Simone. I?m his sister. You've put me in the shit. They?ll be coming. Until they get what they want. We?ve got new orders. And an additional order saying. Avoid combat situations. - What? - Abort attack. Five of our subs are counting on us. Tell the men to stand down! Aye, sir. You will liaise with a vessel and effect an exchange. It's man. Mr Samuel Greenwood.

 Plane! Two U-boats... That?s 100 dead comrades. All because we aborted the attack. And now this poor sod. And now this poor sod. Being killed in combat is one thing... but dying because we?ve taken a passenger on board... a foreigner... That?s... a disgrace. With you in command it would have been different, First Watch Officer. Unfortunately I don?t have a father to make me a captain. Although... Hoffmann senior would have attacked the convoy on his own.

 He wouldn?t have given a damn about orders from HQ. ?Imbued with the determination to win and unrelenting towards himself.? Junior doesn?t understand the meaning of this sentence. If you don?t like my cooking, leave it. I won?t be offended. I?ll leave it out for you in case you get hungry later. - What do you want? - I?m looking for Nathalie. I must to speak to her. Let her in. Sit down. B?atrice takes care of Anna when l?m at work. After a German officer got shot in Nantes, they decided to register us all. As a reprisal. I fled. I got the job at the Cheval Blanc. I never worked upstairs, you know. I?m a barmaid. What?s the best place to hide from the Germans for Jewish girl? Amongst German soldiers. I didn?t know that Frank... He didn?t tell me. I know. With your brother, it just happened like that. Jazz brought us together. Louis Armstrong. The pregnancy wasn?t planned. I asked him for money for an abortion. He didn?t want that. He wanted to keep it. He wanted to be a father. That?s when I told him everything... That I?m Jewish. He didn?t care at all. He couldn?t understand why I hadn?t told him. Frank... wanted to buy passports. Yes... America... It was just an idea, a dream. They?re too expensive on the black market anyway. He wanted to pay with this. He wanted me to give it to a woman. In exchange for passports, I... Do you know what this is? No, all I can tell you is that... he talked more and more about leaving. He said that he may have found a way out. If you knew what I?ve done... Would you like to hold her? Yes. Anna... that?s your Aunt Simone. She likes you. I... must go. Is that your girl? Yes. Show me. Pretty. Is she French? Yes. Tell me, Frank, you speak English, right? Is it true that the guy?s name is Greenwood? Sam Greenwood? Gr?nholz. Samuel Gr?nholz. At home, someone with that name scrubs the road. With a toothbrush. Do we have a fucking Jew on board? I can smell them 10 miles upwind, I swear. Ralf... Any of that dried meat left? The last bit? It?s okay. - Serves you right. - What do you mean? You told Lutz about it. - Change of watch. - So? One look at his dumb, fat face is enough. He can?t keep a secret. - You could have told me. - You?re a big boy. Arsehole. We?ll be a laughing stock back on shore. We?re traitors. So who the fuck is this arsehole? Maybe a POW. Or a spy. Maybe he knows something that could help us win the war. Was that in your book? - He could be Irish. - What? I knew a guy, planesman on U-65. Dead now. He told me they once had a special mission to take two Irishmen from Wilhelmshaven back to Dublin. IRA men, freedom fighters against the Tommies. The Micks know a thing or two about potatoes. Thorsten finally made a joke. Well done, kiddo! Whoever he is, he?s bad luck. Why bad luck? Best peel them to the right or none of us will go home. Another stupid comment like that and I?ll kill you. I promise. That thing about the captain... You heard it too? About the U-boats? Of course. Not that. Something about his last mission. But I couldn?t believe it. Not at first. Then I heard it from a couple of others. What? Come on, tell me. Only if you won?t tell anyone. A damaged U-boat is making a stop here for repairs before carrying on to Lorient. It's Schulz?s boat.. - The Shulz? - Yes. They've been at sea for ten weeks. and they'll be wanting to let off steam. Berlin wants a fuss made of them for the cameras. We'll have to make it look really good. There ould even be some locals. But no one who fought in the Spanish Civil War, and for the wrong side. I can reassure you. The death of that woman is unfortunate. It?s not like you. It?s the fault of the local police. - Was she from around here? - Probably not. - Nobody reported her missing. - What does that mean? - I'm working on it. - Do that, Forster. You know how much I rely on the French workers. I can?t afford to jeopardise the peace on the base. - What now? - What do you mean? We didn?t get it so the Brits won?t help us. And? - How are you? - Hello... - Did you have a nice evening? - Yes, thanks. And you? It was fine, thanks. See you later... Good morning, Inspector Forster. Just call me Mr Forster. Oh, no thank you. Miss Simone, I have a serious problem. - With the prisioner? - Why do you say that? Don?t worry, she?s been relocated. She?s not our problem now. There are more pressing matters. A parade for King Kong. - Who? - His real name is Schulz. A homecoming U-boat captain. Gluck asked me to ensure the event goes smoothly. I wondering if I could talk you into a short outing. Maybe tomorrow? I?d like to show you something very dear to me. Yes. I?m glad, Miss Simone. Are you sure? Yes, I swear. He shot him. In cold blood. - Did you hear about Hoffmann? - No, tell me. He told the firing squad to stand down so he could shoot the kid himself. You made that up. He shot him right in the face. Twice, the cowardly bastard. - Hoffmann? - Of course. Who else? We should sail due north to avoid further air attacks, then swing west here. Can we still make the rendezvous? Yes. If we cross these Allied shipping lanes diagonally. What distance are we talking about? About 30 nautical miles. We could dive underneath the convoy route. Is that technically feasible? If the batteries are fully charged and we squeeze every last milliamp out of them... yes. Very well. We?ll follow the chief engineer?s advice. If you need me, I?ll be on the bridge. Have you heard the rumour that our passenger is a Jew? I?m not interested in rumours, Strelitz. Take him back before I lose my temper. Tennstedt! I was only notifying the passenger that he is not at liberty to walk around. The name of the prisoner was Jacqueline Rossignol. How do we know it?s her? Description matches, and distinguishing features... the Republican tattoo, left breast... Fighter in the  Spanish Civil War... and a communist. Rounded up entering France in 1940, sent to the camp at Vernet. Transferred to a camp in Brittany six months ago but escaped in the company of another inmate who sustained multiple bullet wounds. That?s why the morphine. - Her name? - Carla Monroe. The second person you saw at the church was a woman, right? We need a picture of her. Can I help you? Maybe. Here you are, gentlemen. Enioy your meal. Just a moment, did I understand right? You saw the designs? Tell me, Ralf, do you know the cucumber shooting game? - No. - You don?t? Are you deaf? He just said he didn?t. Okay, listen. Two whores are laid on their backs on the floor. Each of them gets a cucumber shoved up her pussy. Then the shooter slaps his whore on the belly and the one who shoots his cucumber the furthest has won. Can?t you shut your fucking trap for once? - Beginner?s luck. - No such thing. - Another hand? - Of course. Guys, don?t you get bored with gambling? More bored than cruising around playing taxi? What a shitty trip. Watch out, boys, here comes the Frenchman. Frenchman? - Yeah, he?s not a real German. - A Frenchman? And someone from Africa. What kind of crew is this? Strasser, you know you make noises in your sleep? Squealing noises. High-pitched little squeals. Strange squeals. Piggy squeals. You?ve got to be wary of him. He got his CO court-martialled. Don?t talk crap. Did they sentence Heinz, yes or no? It was a disgrace. He sank a hospital ship. But I didn?t squeal. Of course you did. I?m wondering if it runs in your family. Chubby says you saw your sister before we sailed. I?ll pay her a visit. Maybe she?ll squeal too if I give it to her from behind. No, Frank! Strasser! What the hell is wrong with you? Nothing, Captain. Get up. Just a misunderstanding. Extra watch duties for both of you. Starting now for you. Come on, move it. And you, get cleaned up. You look like shit. Everyone in the office is really excited about the parade tomorrow. You too? I won?t attend. I don?t approve of granstanders like Schulz. As if he has done any better than those who are still out there. I?m sorry. I?m sure your brother will come back unharmed. I look forward to meeting him. - If tou please... - Thank you. So? What do you think. It's beautiful. Very big. Yes. I've just bought it. I intend to stay here, Simone. In France. Once we?ve won the war. Come on in. A little snack is waiting for us. Civilisation and its Discontents by Sigmund Freud Freud. My psychology professor was profoundly influenced by his theses. Jewish, yes. But he had some interesting ideas. One day nobody will care that it was written by a Jew. Nobody will remember what a Jew was. A Ch?teaux Grand C?roux. We should really let it breathe, but... Cheers. I'm pleased you accepted my invitation. Gladly. It?s beautiful. Yes, I can see a future for myself here. And an easy life. Once we?ve got rid of a few pockets of resistance. What resistance? Nothing major. Just a few small cells. And what do you mean by cells? It?s usually five or six people, they are decentralised, mainly criminals. But you?ve seen yourself how aggressive they can be. By the way, the prisoner had a female accomplice. In his book, Freud describes very well how some people only follow their destrutive impulses. Unfortunately we don?t have a photo yet, but this could be her. I need that translated. Miss Simone, I have a favour to ask. Would you teach me French? My language skills are unfortunately very mauvaise. Yes... And it would be "mauvais". ?Language skills? are masculine in French. There you have it. I?ve always dreamed of that... A strict teacher with your looks. Come on, let?s go. Where are we up to? Almost done. I?m sorry, sir. I lost control. You and Maas were on the same the same sub? U-311. Hinz?s sub. Don?t worry, Strasser. Is it true that two of our U-boats are missing? From the pack that attacked the convoy? - Who says that? - The first watch officer. The second watch officer heard it on the supply ship. The scout U-boat is always under attack. The other one was probably blasted by the destroyers. Sir, we?re approaching the Allied convoy route. Conning tower hatch closed. Prepare to dive. Rig buoyancy vents. Two U-boats and you don?t say a word? I thought the second watch officer had already told you. It is your duty to report to me. Anything else is an act of insubordination, Tennstedt. You can go. The second watch officer will take over. Dive! Dive to 40 metres. 15 degrees down on the bow planes. Stern, zero. Did you know about the two subs? Yes, but I thought they?d... Second watch officer in control room. Have you ever played this? Never. - Want to learn? - Sure, why not? It?s about getting the king. You use various pieces to do that. Have you heard the saying... ?You can?t do in war what you haven?t learnt in peacetime.? - What? - You know all kinds of shit. I knew a first watch officer who used to say it. Odd guy, had a glass eye which had turned yellow. Oh no, they?re mouldy. It?s going to be stew, then. Just tell me where you heard it. It?s on the wall in the lobby. At M?rwik. M?rwik? The officers? college? Yeah, where else? Stop talking to the passenger. The passports... Take the baby and leave. I didn't think anything good ould ever happen to me again. Frank will join you later. Do you have money? Enough for the... the crossing. - And you know where to go? - To Lisbon, I think. I?ll let him know. He will join you there. And you? What will you do? Make sure you get enough vitamins. We?re already getting the first sniffles, sir. I almost forgot... - Your apple. - Thank you. Sir, I was able to plot our position by the stars. We?re north of the convoy route, as planned. You remember the reason for the war? Air to breathe without Jews and Bolsheviks. And now we?re transporting a bloody Yid. Are you sure of that? The guy is circumcised. 90% of the Yanks are circumcised so that they wank less. It?s true. Ship ahead! Now, now. Slowly. And be quiet. Distance 3 km. She?s heaving to. She?s got it in for us. Alarm! Corvette at zero-zero-five! Alarm! Wake up, arseholes! Put the bunks away. Flood tubes 1 to 4! - Hatch is closed. - Dive! Dive to periscope depth. 15 degrees down on bow planes, stern zero. An American Corvette. They?ve detected us. Do we try to avoid them? If they alert other escorts, we could come under sustained attack. We can?t chicken out again. Not this time. Battle stations. Aye, sir. Battle stations! Battle stations! Open outer doors. Distance 2000. Angle-on-the-bow, starboard 30. Torpedo speed 30, running depth 4. Right full rudder. New course zero-four-five. Right full rudder. New course zero-four-five. In three minutes, angle-on-the-bow, starboard 45. Our best shot. Today we?re in luck. Corvette now at three-four-zero. Angle-on-the-bow, starboard 40. Make ready tubes 1 and 2 for submerged firing. Forward room, make ready tubes 1 and 2 for submerged firing. Tubes 1 and 2 ready for submerged firing. Go on, Tiger. Your turn today. Maintain periscope depth. One metre up. Five degrees up on bow planes. Torpedo speed 30. Enemy speed 15, angle-on-the-bow, starboard 45. Distance 1700. Is there a problem, First Watch Officer? No problem, sir. Torpedo speed 30. Enemy speed 15, angle-on-the-bow, starboard 45. Distance 1700. Fire one. Fire two. - Fire one. Fire two. - Fire torpedoes! Four... five... six... seven... eight... Safety released! Move it! Secure! - Secured! - Now push it in. 21... 22... 23... 24... Pull it back! Help me. Lift him. Fucking hell! Jesus Christ. We need a belt, quick. Rig for surfacing. I?m sorry, but you can?t keep it. We need to amputate. Hold him down, okay? Really hard. Grab hold of his arm. Tight. Now we start to cut, okay? You ready? You can do it, buddy. You can do it. That?s your responsibility. We survive air raids and destroyer attacks then something like this happens here! You have slight concussion. This will help with headaches. Get some rest. Hey, can you get me more wine? A bottle of wine, please. Pour it. Hey, has one of you ever fucked her? No. But she?s pretty. Way prettier than yours. You?re right. All right, let?s go upstairs. No, I just work at the bar. What? She says she only works down here and doesn?t fuck. Girl, that feels as wrong as a bomb going off in a safe harbour. Are you trying to run? If you won?t come upstairs, we?ll do it right here. Fucking French whore! Do as you?re told! Fuck her! Fuck her! Fuck her!
