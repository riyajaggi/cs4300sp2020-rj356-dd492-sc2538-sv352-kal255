 I do love her, you know. So why don't you introduce her to your father? I hereby state my intention  to run for the Senate. You know, as the future  Mrs. Sam Greenwood. Oh, that's funny. Would you marry a Jewish girl? - Get me back to Germany. - Do you really want that? - Of course. - But first you'll help me. - Hoffmann is working for Greenwood. - What's his game, huh? Mr. Thomas O'Leary. There are those of us who believe we're on the wrong side with the wrong allies in this war.

 You're still protecting that family? They need to leave France quickly. Were you close to him? He was my brother. And this business with  von Reinhartz? He has betrayed our trust  in him and his position in the most disgraceful manner. How many U-Boots will you lose  if von Reinhartz gives the enemy  his U-Boat and the codes? That is the only moral option we have left. Captain, are we running from our own comrades? "Order to sink has been issued." You're relieved of your command, Captain. If I get out of here alive, I'll find you, von Reinhartz.

 I have to get out of here! Even if it's the last thing I do. Captain. Von Reinhartz's Falcons. Captain. Captain. Von Reinhartz's Falcons. - Captain. - Von Reinhartz's Falcons. Von Reinhartz's Falcons. Strasser. Grund. Take the officers and the rest  of the crew to the torpedo room. Captain.  But some of us are on your side. I know.  I can only trust the men I've already spoken to. Strasser, organize an armed guard. Two men. - Come with me. - Pflug and Heitmann, come with me. Hands off. They can't do this to us. Water in the engine room! Water in the Bridge! Go go go!. Quiet. Hydrophone. Radio operator. Report. No more depth charges,  Captain! They don't have any more. No Corvette in the world carries enough depth charges  to sink me. Grothe,  what about the electric motors? Captain,  the electric motors are working. Start them. - Chief Helmsman? - Yes, sir. Resume previous course. Go to periscope depth. Aye-Aye, Captain. Captain? Please come with me. Lüders? Senior Mechanic? He won't leave me alone. Who won't leave you alone? Lutz.  Lutz won't leave him alone. He stares at me. Lutz is dead. He died on our last mission. Understood? That's why he's here. Look at me, Lüders. That's why he's here. Look at me! Now it's our turn. Lutz is dead. We catch that filthy traitor  von Reinhartz and then we'll show him  we're very much alive. Is that clear. Senior Mechanic? Captain! What? Straighten him up.  Grothe. Come here. Come. Damage report, Chief. The port diesel isn't our problem,  that's just a cylinder head. But on the starboard diesel, that is an entire rod-bearing. Can you replace it? You don't get it. We have no spare on board. I won't be undone by a  broken rod-bearing, so kindly think of something. Make that a bit neater, Grothe. And more layers. Do you think they'll hold? We'll have to see. Exactly what kind of knife  is that? It belonged to Hoffmann. Can you remember him? Where is Lüders, then? He said there was more tin foil in the ammo box. Pips! Pips, no! Thank you. You know. If I was on my way to North Africa to fight the Nazis ... this freedom package,  full of all-American goods,  would go a little way to making  me feel closer to home. Little closer to my women folk. Do you support the war,  Mr. Greenwood? 100 percent.  I see it as a great opportunity. To make some money? To make the world a better place. By doing business  with Nazi Germany? The only business I'm in ... is ridding the world of the evils of fascism. Oh, you want proof. Well, Greenwood  Commercial Ventures  is at the moment developing  a radar, so portable, so accurate ... we can spot an enemy plane  or a U-Boat periscope at 10,000 feet. Print that. How you doing, ladies?  Fine. See that that wise-guy journalist  is taken off the list. Hello! And what are we doing  for the guys abroad? Everyone cheerful? It's a great job you're doing. I really appreciate it. Here to give your best to our brave boys, Mr. Hoffmann? Sounds like a lot of your pals  are going to die if he really does develop  this radar he's boasting about. Do you want Germany  to win this war? Did you know that Roosevelt  and his commi Jew friends knew about Pearl Harbor  in advance? Yeah.  Still let it happen. It was the only way he could  convince America to come in with the Brits  and the Soviets.  This is true.  And did you know that we're  currently arming Soviet Russia? And when they're done  with you Germans, they're gonna turn  those guns on us.  Mark my words. That's why we need a new leader  in the White House. Damn! We're running late.  The reporters' already here. Huh.  It's great, huh? Ah. Would you look at that. Not content with the Jew vote. Greenwood's going for the  nigger vote too. Excuse me. This is going to be wonderful publicity for you. What better way to appear  in a white newspaper  than standing next to  the state's next senator. - Hey. - Hey. Alright.  You ready? I can wait with Robinson. Yeah. Alright.  Look after her for me.  Will ya? Here.  Let me hold this for you. Hey boys. How you doing? My son, Samuel Greenwood. Leading the fight against the enemy. Like I'm a child,  that might run away. You don't want to run away? I'm sorry. How was New Orleans? - It was heaven. - And the recording? Got the first pressing at my place if you want to come over. Take a listen. Yeah? Now, why don't you go and  fetch her, Ari. See, ah.  Tammy Hall's against me. I need Jewish and black  middle class support. Yeah. Thank you. Father, you might remember  Cassandra Lloyd from the party? - Hi. - Of course. Where do you want me, Ari? Stand here, Jack. Gentlemen, Please. Clear the picture. Yeah. Miss.  You wouldn't mind? Eh...  What am I to do with this? Just smile. - Cassie! - Feisty little thing, huh. Cassie! Give me my coat. Alright, come on. I'll take a few more questions. - Mr. Greenwood, when will ... - Not from you. You. Cassie! Cassie, wait. Wait. For once I thought I might be seen  as an equal by white folk.  Standing eye-to-eye  to a white man, asking me for my vote. Then you stick  a flag in my hand and want me  to look up to him  like he's the master  and I'm some slave - beaten into subservience. - No, no, no, no, no. It's just a flag. It's our flag. Let him wave it then. Cassandra. - What? - Why do you think I'm doing all this? Huh? Why do you think I got you  the bus .. and and the studio in New Orleans? And come see you perform  every other night? Cassandra,  I'd do anything for you. - Because Cassandra... - Sam. - Yeah? - Stop pretending. I don't love you and I don't think you love me. You'd have taken my hand,  already. Hey, I'm so sorry. The other contacts must have  been in the villages north and south of here. Jean-Luc must've given the names. The situation is hopeless. It gave me courage  when you came to see me. This is Sylvie. My neighbor, the village baker. You can rely on her 100%. Margot. You know Bizet.  Good evening, David. Have a seat. That's all of us. Not much to take on  the German army. Fewer people to give it away  if it comes to that. Good. If we want to establish  a new escape route, we must replace the contacts  Forster destroyed. And restore communication  with the old ones. We can all sound out  the people we know. - And you can contact Marseille? - Yes. Ruth and I can't wait  until the route is restored. They're rounding up refugees  in the region.  They know we escaped  from La Rochelle. What can we do? If you can take us south, as far as possible, we'll manage after that. There's no way we can just  walk around like that. Once a week, I go to Angoulème to get flour.  Tomorrow night. I have a permit that allows  me drive after curfew. I can hide you  in the back of my van. And after that?  We'll need papers. If you're in the back... - Yes, but to cross the border. Yes. Jean-Luc told me the Spanish  are now turning back Jews. Franco does whatever  his friend Adolf tells him.  He's a lap dog. I know someone who  can do the papers. He might be able to help. All right. In any case. I hope that if these bastards  come looking for us, we'll be able to put up  a bit more of a fight than poor Jean-Luc. And, there you go. Gifts from my former patients. Father? - Yes? - Sorry to disturb you.. but would you hear  my confession? Follow me. Good day. Good morning.  Tell Inspector Duval I'd like to speak to him. Of course. Right away, Inspector. What you're asking of me  is illegal. If they stay here  their lives are at risk. We must get them out  tomorrow night. My job is to care  for their immortal souls. I can't write out baptism certificates here.  Wait for me in the sacristy. I thought you were on the way  to Clermont. No. I felt like I waiting  to see the transportation of the last Jews. Come. Take a look at this. Impressive. What is it, exactly? These are out new labor camps in the east. Recently, I was lucky enough  to admire them with my own eyes. Look. These are the barracks. Here are the factories. A medical research facility. It's enormous. That is just one. Three more satellite camps  are planned. I mean, in Poland  we have the space and can operate undisturbed  on the necessary scale. Those are the shower areas. From there it lead out  to the incinerators. Know what's best  about them? They heat both the factories  and the barracks at the same time. It's very efficient. Logical. A masterpiece  in the art of planning. It was all built  in just a few months  within budget as part of  Operation Reinhard. Hagen. You now belong  to the inner circle. You know full well, you can no longer refuse this promotion. Of course.  If you and Berlin think I'm the right man for this task. Very good. A father and... and his daughter. Dubois, Didier. Dubois, Rosa.  That very good. I'll drop them off  at the bistro later. Thank you, Father. - Yes? -Inspector? I believe you know  the train depot manager. Yes.  Slightly. Yes. Telephone for you, sir. Someone from St-Rémy. He says he has information. Very confidential. Thank you. As soon as I've  taken this call, we'll go to the  train station. Yes, sir. Who am I speaking to,  please? Look at that. See who's come  to pay us a visit? Is this better? Much better.  Yes. I wanted to thank you. It was kind ... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mr. Baptiste. The depot manager. With all the men gone,  I'm also the level crossing keeper, chief engineer and second man. You are to provide me  with a train, Mr. Baptiste. For transporting prisoners  to Drancy. All our passenger trains were requisitioned by the Defence Force. Obviously,  passenger trains are reserved for officers and officials  of the Reich. A freight train will do. The Defence Force  requisitioned them too. And this one here? That wagon's for cattle not people. But it's for prisoners. Perfect.  It will departure at night. - Sir ... - In fact .. I hold you responsible for the safe and prompt  running of this transport. It's you,  who'll be the operator.  Mr. Desjesquier and a few  guards will accompany you. Good, Inspector, if you'll excuse me. I've got a lead to follow up. You're not taking  Mr. Desjesquier with you? There's no need. I want to be sure  there's something to it before  I waste everyone's time. Would you keeping an eye  on Mr. Duval for me?  He seems a little.... sensitive lately. The Chief's rod-bearing seems to be holding up. Aye-Aye, Captain. What about about the  cylinder head on the port diesel? Should be finished  within the hour. Give him an extra drink as a reward. Aye-Aye, Captain. Is there something else? We should bury Pips properly.  We're not stopping. Order an Air Launch if you absolutely have to. Aye-Aye, Captain. Like the breaking of the waves, bound by nothing, we let you go ... and hand you over  to the whims of the sea. Torpedo Mixer. Prepare tube one  to fire for Air Launch. Tube one, ready to fire. Attention! Tube one.  Air Launch. I hope you're at peace now. Take care, Buddy. 250 miles. Until where? Until the Hudson River. We sail directly  into New York Harbor and surrender the boat  over to the US Navy. That's quite a daring plan. Especially, when there are only  15 of us sailing this boat. We can do it. I'll do anything to end this war. Laudrup? Have you changed your mind? What?  No. Four years in a sardine can  all over the Atlantic? Always being told what to do  and what not to do? I certainly haven't  changed my mind. But ... New York? That's quite something. - Friedrich. - Thomas. I thought you'd might have  a glass of that Alabama schnapps. Maine. Trip to the pine tree state  coming up? I was at Jack Greenwood's event. You supporting him now? With the present company he's  keeping? Hardly. Ran into our U-Boat captain  there too. You still thinking of availing  of his military expertise? He owes me. Well I set him straight  about American politics. Told him he had to do  his patriotic duty. I will deal with Hoffmann. I called by my friends  at McSorley's. Telegram from Dublin.  Might confirm he's bona fide. Excuse me. What is it? I don't know yet. - Berger. - Klaus here. I need your help. There's something I have to do. For the Fatherland. Then you can make up  for your mistake. Tomorrow at midnight. All right. Can I get another schnapps? ELIMINATE HOFFMANN There are much more  of us as them. Just because they're down here doesn't mean they're against him. So what? Even if it's just half of us. They're too busy  with the boat. The door's not even locked. They have weapons.  We don't. How do you get the  torpedoes in here? Through the torpedo loading  hatch, above the bulkhead. That's it! Good luck. We're in the middle  of the Atlantic. At least I'm thinking of  a way out. My loyalty  isn't in question here. I'm just saying that  he's onto something. - Gentlemen!  - Sit down! Up to now,  von Reinhartz's  heading in the same  direction we need to go. You'll follow my orders completely.  Is that clear? We'll wait for our chance. Here's something to eat. Soup. Make room, Shorty. Are you shitting me? No one can eat that shit. - Why not try it. - It's disgusting. I'm getting something decent. Spare yourselves the fantasy  of another mutiny. My men have orders to  immediately shoot anyone putting just one foot  outside that door. I know there are also comrades in here who want this war to end. I promise to do everything  to make sure  that the Americans  treat you fairly. Don't believe you'll get away  with this so easily, von Reinhartz. I don't. Now eat.  I brought her. I'll be upstairs if you need me. Why did you risk  coming here? Someone here is passing  info to Forster. And he was left hanging  from a tree. No, he called today. Oh no. If you keep carry on  hiding this family, he'll get you too. I have to do it. You are very brave, Miss Bostal. In truth,  I'm scared to death. Take every precaution possible. There is something that might  interest you and your friends. All those arrested here  will be  transported to Drancy tonight. We have to stop them. You're not alone. I know the train operator. I'll talk to him. Right, ladies... Were you involved in my brother's death? The man left hanging. No, it wasn't me. It was Forster's mutt. Good evening, Miss. Look who it is. You've led us on a real  wild goose chase. And all this time you were the Inspector's sweetheart. How charming. You let him fuck you  with his old cock? And why? Info? Or just because  you like old cock? I knew you were a slut. I'll get you, dirty whore! I need your help, Yves. I guess if you come knocking  on my door at this time, it couldn't be very official. That's right. My wife is expecting  our third child. I wouldn't ask  if it wasn't important and urgent. You know the level crossing  in the forest near Saint-Madeleine? Show us the wagon for the prisoner transport. Move it! This way. This is the wagon Forster asked for. What are you doing here?  Get lost! What's the meaning of this,  you piece of shit? It means, Mr. Duval, that you're under arrest. Excuse me? This is absurd. What for? Fraternizing and conspiring  with enemies of the state. This is outrageous. Take him to the cells, Mr. Desjesquier. We'll continue this conversation at my convenience. This is crazy. Who's the piece of shit now,  huh? After all I did for you ... this is .. this is how you repay me? Christ. I even lied to the police  to keep you out of prison. What kinna person  are you, huh? What kinna person repay that  kinna generosity by trying to.. trying to steal his best friend's girl? Sam, it's her choice  who she goes with. - Not mine or yours. - Yeah. Yeah it's her choice. The thing that gets me  with this is .. if she was in your country, you'd already have her arrested and shipped away  and killed by now. Wouldn't you? You got 24 hours Buddy, before I call the police on you. Sam! Taxi! Max! Max! Max! Max! You should have  let me drown, sir! - She's here. - Really? You hear that Ruth? She's here. Check we haven't  forgotten anything and put on your coat. You all right, Margot? Yes. Baptism certificates. Father Etienne kept his word. Thank you. Thank you for everything  you've done. I hope you find your wife. They're ready. We have to go. We'll have to hide you  in the back of the van. Duval said  there's an informant. Okay. Take good care of your dad. Margot. Go. Margot, take care of yourself. Thank you. I'm sorry.  We have to go. Go on. Goodbye. Goodbye. Let's go. You're late.  This whole thing was your idea. If you want to go through with it,  we need to go. Listen.  There's no turning back for me. I need to know how I get home. Sam threatened to report me  to the authorities  if I don't give him  more details about our radar defence system. I have to get out of here after I get these plans for you. I really only wanted to  show you this afterwards. The night after next, three comrades will arrive here. The same boat will then  take you back to the homeland. Berlin will be very happy  with us  when you arrive back home  with the plans. They were pleased to hear that you're still alive. Really? And do you know, if Berlin informed my father? I assume so.  Here, take that. It's all a lie. I swear it, Ari. I have nothing to do with them. I need you to believe that. And I need you to call  the evening news  and tell them I'm gonna sue  the hell outta them and that so-called journalist  for saying so. Where have you been? Drinking. What are you doing in my place? What's Rosenmeyer doing here? GREENWOOD LINKS TO NAZI GERMANY - Jesus. - That God damn Journalist! I need you, to go to the office. It's late, Pops. This is serious. I'm talking FBI. I'm talking Grand Juries. There's a file.  Bosque Verde. It's our Cuban holding company. You'll know which one it is because there is a transfer  for a million dollars to a Reichsbank account. The money that paid  for you to come home. And you'll deal  with Hoffmann later. Okay, Pops. They're not backing down. They will. Hurry. Do you have it? Yes, I have them. Downtown. Go uptown. Go to Germany. Don't go to Switzerland. I'm still your mailboy. Berger? Sam! Sam! Sam! Stay! Stay! Sam! Berger, what have you done? What's going on in there? - We have to go. - Mr. Greenwood? I'm sorry. Mr. Greenwood? Mr. Greenwood? You never said anything about a weapon. - We're at war. You're a soldier. - He was my friend. He was the enemy! I'm sorry. Orders from Berlin.
