 by a pretty girl visiting a sunny beach. (BUZZING CONTINUES) NARRATOR ON TV: Although she does not yet feel it, she is subject, like all things, to the law that makes energy tend to spread out uniformly. At the moment, she's comfortable and warm. Warm, thanks to the rays of the sun, which are soaked up by her skin. Warm, thanks to the food she has eaten. Food the sun made grow. Food which her body has converted into heat energy. But warm as she is, when the sun goes,

 the girl will lose heat. That is because heat always... (TONE BLARING) MAN ON TV: We interrupt this program for a local emergency alert. Important news will follow. I'm Don Gordon with "BTV News." The National Weather Service has issued a severe flash flood warning. (TONE BLARING) DON: Local authorities are now fully mobilized. This is not a test. (TONE BLARING) (GULPS, SLURPS) (WINCING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) WOMAN: Housekeeping. No, thank you. (SNIFFLES) (FLY BUZZING) (CRYING) (CRYING CONTINUES) (FLY BUZZING) (BUZZING CONTINUES) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) No, thank you. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) (TV TURNS ON) MAN ON TV: ...further report from Greg Kendall of WISH-TV from the jetliner crash. GREG: The crash scene is a mass of debris and parts of bodies. The jetliner nosed into the ground after it was hit by a small private plane. The commercial jetliner carried a crew of four and 78 passengers. No one survived. Authorities have now started the massive task of finding bodies and pieces of the plane... (JET ENGINE STARTS) ...in an attempt to determine what happened. The jetliner disintegrated on impact. It left a huge crater as it narrowly missed a row of trailers only 75-100 yards away. (JET ENGINE ROARING) GREG: While no one in the mobile home force was hurt, several trailers were damaged by flying debris. The entire area was covered... (ROARING ENGINE DROWNS OUT DIALOGUE) (TOUCH TONES BEEPING) - (LINE RINGING) - (WOMAN SNIFFLES) (SIGHS) WOMAN ON PHONE: Edendhurst Medical. May I help you? WOMAN: Dr. Dan Benich, please. - WOMAN ON PHONE: One moment, please. - Thank you. (MUSIC PLAYING OVER PHONE) DAN: Dr. Benich. Are you alone? - Joan? - Don't say my name out loud. Joan? What... what the hell? Are you alone? I... I'm alone. - I... I'm confused. - I'm okay. It's okay, I'm alive. Oh, my God. I didn't know what to do. Oh, God. It's me, my darling. I've been a wreck. Oh, God. I'm okay. - I thought you were... - I know, but I'm not. I'm... I'm here. - Okay. - I should be dead, but I'm here. DAN: I was a mess over here. I couldn't talk to anyone. It was so awful. (CRYING) I saw this man yelling for his wife and kids 'cause they were in another seat. And I just saw them get completely engulfed in flames. DAN: All the telecasts claim everyone is dead. Your picture was on the news. Have you called your kids? No. Steven? No. I'm the one you called first? - Yeah. - (CHUCKLES) My God. (EXHALES) - I thought about you. - Yeah? When we were on the plane, we flew over the highway, and I thought about you in your car. I actually had this thought. If I died on this flight, I would be fine. - Oh, sweetheart. - No, 'cause I can't... all this hiding all these years, it's... it's hell. I know. How can I see you? Where are you? I'm at some ho... motel. Does anyone else know you're there? No, I don't think so. You remember you said we would need a miracle... for us to be together? (BREATHING HEAVILY) I think this is it. - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - WOMAN: Mrs. Smith? - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Mrs. Smith? - Mrs. Teakins? - DAN: Is someone at the door? WOMAN: Mrs. Teakins, I know you used another name to check in, - but I know it's you. - Oh, my God. - DAN: What? Joanie, wait. - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - Wait, wait. Don't hang up. - (POUNDING ON DOOR) - Joanie, what's going on? - I have to go. DAN: No, wait, no! WOMAN: Mrs. Teakins, are you feeling all right? Have you felt any kind of dizziness or weakness? Might've hit your head and not even realized. Mrs. Teakins, I know you're in there. (POUNDING ON DOOR) No, you've made a mistake. This is the wrong room. WOMAN: I know that it's you. Flight 1438. Clipped the trees up behind the hill. Crashed behind Montgomery Ward this morning. What do you want? I know that you were on the plane. Just go away now! Mrs. Teakins, you may be in a state of shock. - (SIGHS) - I have medical training. I could at least check your vitals. I also brought you some food. I even got you a toothbrush. You were clutching a yellow life jacket, walking on 28. There was only a single part of the plane left intact after it bounced through the trees. I don't know what you're talking about. You have a husband, two grown children. I saw them on the news. I wasn't on that flight. Mrs. Teakins, I really am just here to help you. Mrs. Teakins? (RATTLING) WOMAN: You're lucky you haven't been found out yet, but the press could catch wind any minute. Could be a real zoo here soon. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (LOCK SLIDES) (RAIN PATTERING) (DOOR CLOSES) Are you injured at all? No. No cuts, abrasions? No. Why all the blood on the sheets, then? I... (SCOFFS) I cut myself shaving. WOMAN: Here. You must be ravenous. What is your name? Liza. And you're a paramedic? I was once trained as a medic, yes. Wow. You must believe in God. What? You're like the phoenix. You just rose up from the ashes and now you're here. I'm curious, do you believe in all that stuff... God and heaven? No, I do not. Why are you here? - I told you, I'm here because... - Yeah, I know, to help me. We both know that's garbage. What are you, like a reporter? Get the big story, the... the one woman who survived the plane crash? - That would be a big story. - Yes, big story. Any young reporter would want to get that scoop. That does make sense. Uh-huh. - Okay. - "Okay"? What, you're just gonna come into my room and I'm just gonna tell you my whole story? What about me? You're just gonna sell it to the papers? What about me? What about the story that I want? Well, that's a fair point. If it's your story, then why don't you tell it to me? Who are you, Joan? Oh, God, you're good. (LAUGHS) Oh, my... oh, you're good. I get it. I get it, you come in here and you're all, "I'm here to help you." Yeah, and then I tell you everything. You're a very... you're a very good reporter. Very good. All right, well, I finished eating. I'd like you to leave now. (SIGHS) I asked you to leave. But you don't really want me to. (LAUGHING) Really? - Yes. - Oh. Okay. Well, please, you know, enlighten me. You walked away from a plane crash and checked into this motel. You could've called your family, but you didn't. You're trapping me. You've trapped yourself, haven't you, Joan? I don't want any... there to be any story about me. And why is that? Is it because you haven't decided what you want your story to be yet? Is it because part of you wants to stay here? Call your family, tell them you're okay. Go back to that life. It wasn't a perfect life, but it was a life. And you put a big down payment on it and you want to see it through. Out of a sense of duty and obligation. But there's another part of you that wants to walk through that door to a new life entirely. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Tell me, Joan, who was it you were speaking to on the phone just now? I'm not judging you. I'm just here to help. Were you listening to my conversation? Were you eavesdropping through the door? - That doesn't matter. - Of course it matters! - It's my life! - I understand that, but... You don't understand anything. You... you make it sound like it's this... simple decision between these two things. (PHONE RINGING) (CRYING) - Ah! - Joan. - You need help. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, I do. I do, I do, I do. - (RINGING CONTINUES) - What's his name, Joan? (DIAL TONE) Dan can't help you anymore. How do you know his name? Put down the phone. Are you spying on me? How do you know everything? You need to make a decision, Joan. Joan, put the phone down. You've got to focus. - Time is almost up, Joan. - Stop. - This is not the answer that you need. - No. (MUTTERING) - Joan, you have to choose. - Will you shut up? - I'm not gonna decide! - Stop! (CRYING) Good. Now, it's time for you to make a decision. Would Steven and the children really miss you? That's a big part of this. It's a hard question. I know it's very hard for you. Perhaps even harder is the question of... would they be better off without you? 'Cause you never really were the mother or the wife you thought you could be. You were really just a big disappointment. (GRUNTS) God! (CHOKING, COUGHING) (GASPING) (GRUNTING) (CHOKING CONTINUES) (GASPING) (PANTING) (GROANING) (GROANING) (COUGHING) Oh, my God. (PANTING) (GROANS, COUGHING) (EXHALES) (GASPING) - (EXHALES) - (FLY BUZZES) (ELECTRICITY FLICKERING) (LIGHT BULBS SHATTER) (GASPS) LIZA: You've been contemplating this for too long. Unfortunately... I can't help you anymore. No, no. Wait. Yes? What are we gonna do about my story? What... what's gonna happen to me? LIZA: What would you like to happen? I don't know. Think about it. (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) (GASPS) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING, BUZZING) (JET ENGINE ROARING) - (CRASHING) - (SKIN SIZZLING) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (WOMAN SCREAMING) - (RAIN PATTERING) - (FLY BUZZING) (TONE BLARING) MAN ON TV: We interrupt this program for a local emergency alert. - (THUNDER RUMBLING) - Important news will follow. DON: I'm Don Gordon with "BTV News." The National Weather Service has issued a severe flash flood warning. (TONE BLARES) Local authorities are now fully mobilized. (FLY BUZZING) This is not a test.
