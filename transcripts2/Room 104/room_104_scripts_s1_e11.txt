 COMMENTATOR: She's still protecting that left side, though, Greg, you know? I wonder if she came back a little too early from that injury. - What do you think, man? - (LAUGHS) How long is she gonna wait? At her age, she's probably only got a few fights left before they send her off to the glue factory, you know what I'm saying? - COMMENTATOR: Jesus, Greg! - (PHONE BUZZING) COMMENTATOR #2: What? I'm sorry. - Hey. - MAN OVER PHONE: Hey, how's my girl? Are you ready? I'm nervous as shit. Nah, nah, you're gonna be great. Did they even fix my name on the marquee yet? Oh, yeah, they... yeah, they're working on it. What about the hotel mix-up?

 Yeah, you know, they, uh... they haven't called me back yet. - So I gotta... - Jesus, JR. What? What are you so pissy about? It's supposed to be my big shot. I'm the fucking headline on this fight tomorrow night, and they're supposed to put me in a... what did they call it in the contract? - Four-star hotel. - That's right. A four-star hotel, and this is the shit hole that they put me in. Yeah, and that's why I said if it's really bad, then we'll move you and deal with them later, okay? - No, no, it's not about that. - Okay, okay... It's about them showing me some fucking respect, JR. Okay, I got it, all right? Do you really... do you... (SIGHS) What? Is it really worth freaking out like this? Well, you know Rayna Gold's getting her fucking four-star hotel. I fucking know for a fact that she is not, okay? You need to be focusing on the fight and get some sleep. No, what's Rayna making on this fucking fight? You know she's making more than the six grand that I'm making. You know, six grand is not a bad wage for a day's work. "Not a bad wage for a day's work"? Dude, I can fight, what, four times a year? That's $24,000. And that's before I have to pay you and my fucking medical bills, so don't fucking tell me, JR, how well I'm paid. All right, fine! I... all right, I'm sorry. - Calm down. - I will not fucking calm down! I wanna stay in the same fucking kind of goddamn hotel that Rayna Gold's fucking staying in! You are in the same hotel as Rayna Gold. She's in this fucking hotel? Yes! Yes! Well, why the fuck would they put us in the same goddamn hotel the night before we fight? Jesus, Greta, I don't fucking know! I... I don't know what to tell you. - Just deal with it. - (SIGHS) If you wanna blow up your career and you wanna bitch out some upper-level executive about a hotel booking, then be my guest. Thanks a lot, JR. You're the fucking best. I guess I'll see you tomorrow. - Good Ni... - (HANGS UP) (EXHALES) (LINE RINGING) - WOMAN OVER PHONE: Front desk. - Rayna Gold's room, please. - Uh, can you repeat the name? - Rayna Gold. No, we don't have any guest here under that name. Uh, Carol Jackson. One moment, please. (LINE RINGING) (SIGHS) RAYNA OVER PHONE: Hello? So they put you in this shit hole, too, huh? The fuck do you want? We need to talk. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) What makes you think I'm making more? Well, you got more experience, your record's better. I gotta think that all that shit adds up. (SCOFFS) (SCOFFS) Six grand. With a six-grand win bonus - after I beat your ass. - Dude, no, fuck that. How many people do you think are gonna be there tomorrow night? People bought the tickets. They're expensive. People watching the livestream. All the merchandise they're gonna sell. We don't fucking see any of that shit. Getting our heads busted the fuck in for what? All right, I'm going to sleep. I don't know what the fuck you're... Tell me it doesn't bother you. Yeah, that shit bothers me. But what the fuck else am I supposed to do? I got kids. I gotta put food on the table, man. What are we supposed to do? (SIGHS) We call Martha Simms. You know, Martha Simms. That old-ass, rich white lady? Okay, hear me out. Everybody is making money in this business but the fighters, right? We can't change that 'cause the system is fucked. But we can try and beat it. How? 'Cause we're gonna throw the fight. We're gonna throw it, and we're gonna make a ton of money doing it. (BOTH PANTING) (EXHALES) Damn, man! I said watch the fucking punches. Yeah, well, you were the one fucking smashing my face into the carpet like a fucking cheese grater. I'm just sayin'. Yeah, well, I'm just sayin'. (PHONE BEEPS) - (GRUNTS) - Oh, shit! I didn't mean...! (GROANING) (GRUNTING) (GLASS SHATTERS) - (GRUNTS) - Fuck! You split my fucking face! Yeah, well, you started that shit with the fucking uppercut! (BUZZER BLARES) (BOTH PANTING) (MARTHA TALKING OVER PHONE, INDISTINCT) Oh, yeah, I've talked to Rayna. She's down. So you'll bet 500,000 on the fight, take 20% off the top, and we'll split the rest. All right. Hold on a sec. The odds are even, so she needs to know who to bet on. You know what? We're gonna have to call you back with that. Till then, just get the money together and then we'll make the bet first thing in the morning. Okay? All right, I'll get back to you. Look, it doesn't really matter who wins or loses, right? Right. Because we're gonna get out after tomorrow night anyways, right? Right. Okay, so then it doesn't matter. Right, it doesn't matter. Yeah, so? So? (SIGHS) (BOTH PANTING) (GRUNTS) Hey! What the fuck, man?! - You're fucking cheating! - I'm not fucking cheating, dude! I fucking saw you grab the bed, bitch. You're just fucking scared 'cause you know I was gonna fucking win! No, 'cause you're fucking cheating! Enough. GRETA: So, we gotta watch the faces so that we don't look like shit for tomorrow night. We gotta cover our asses so that no one gets suspicious. No, shit. We gotta keep this shit super tight and be careful. And since there's no judge, we gotta keep it clean. - No face work. - Simple. All right, how many rounds, three? RAYNA: Three two-minute rounds. GRETA: So, winner takes 60%? RAYNA: Hold up. On the phone, you told Martha we split 50/50. GRETA: Yeah, but I think the winner should get more. What, scared you're gonna lose? RAYNA: Fuck you. 60/40 it is. - GRETA: Tap out? - Tap out. Whoever taps loses. (BOTH PANTING) - (BOTH GROAN) - Fuck. What do your kids think when they see you like this? They're used to it. (SIGHS) What are you gonna do when you get out of this? (SCOFFS) That's a good question. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Fighting's the only thing I've ever been good at, but I'm tired of getting fucked over, man. (SIGHS) Okay, let's finish this thing. Last round. (EXHALES) (BOTH GRUNTING) - (GRUNTS) - (GRUNTS, GROANS) - (GRUNTS) - Fuck! (GRUNTS) (BUZZER BLARES) (BOTH PANTING) - GRETA: What if no one taps? - (EXHALES) RAYNA: One of us is gonna tap, but it ain't gonna be me. (GROANS) GRETA: I've never tapped in my life. RAYNA: Well, one of us has to lose. (BOTH GRUNTING) (GROANING) (BOTH SCREAMING) (BOTH GRUNTING) Fucking tap! Tap, bitch, before I break your fucking arm. - GRETA: Tap! - (GRUNTS) Tap. Fucking tap! (BOTH GRUNTING) (SIGHS) (MUTTERS) There's that. Jesus. (TV PLAYING, MUFFLED) (WOMEN GRUNTING) - MAN: Oh! - (CROWD CHEERING) - COMMENTATOR: Come on! Oh, man! - Everything okay in there? MAN: Uh, yeah, crazy good fight! Yeah? Who's fighting? I don't know. Two chicks, but they're fucking going at it. It's an all-out brawl. Best fight ever, man, seriously! Oh! Dude, you gotta come see this! Really? Yeah, really, man! Come on over. - Oh! - MAN #2: You see that?! Yeah, you bet. - COMMENTATOR: Oh! - (CROWD CHEERING) COMMENTATOR #2: These two have been through a war, and they just keep bringing it. You gotta wonder how they're even on their feet. COMMENTATOR: Best fight I've seen in a long time. COMMENTATOR #2: Seriously, we won't be forgetting the names of Rayna Gold and Greta Gaines any time soon. (CROWD GASPS) COMMENTATOR #2: Oh, she just got the arm bar. - COMMENTATOR: This is it. - (RAYNA GRUNTS) COMMENTATOR #2: But she's not tapping out. It's like she wants her to break it! - COMMENTATOR: Oh, oh! - (GRETA GRUNTS) - (BONE SNAPS) - CROWD: Oh!
