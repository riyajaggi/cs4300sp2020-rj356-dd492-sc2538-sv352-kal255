Plus another 100 to just talk. $300? And I put my pants on. Please, don't go. What is your name? Rose. Huh? I'm Boris. Boris. See? My father gave me this when I was little. Before Vukovar, you know, the massacre. Gonna be a lot of unhappy children left in this world, I tell you. Santa Claus fucking quit. I'm sorry. I was cleaning up and I had a phone call from my son. Another guest left that Santa suit. Must be freezing his nuts off. There it is. I... I apologize for the inconvenience. No, it's... it's cool. Don't worry about stupid shit. Well, my boss could fire me for that. He's not nice to you, your boss? (SIGHS, SCOFFS) No. It's okay, it's a job. Eh, sorry about that, you know? I can take the Santa suit.

Of course you are allowed! Of course you are! It's your life, Rose. You live one time. You have to be able to do what you must. You know, like, just relax, have a drink! - One drink, I beg you. - I can't, I... If your boss come, we'll tell him I kidnapped you, hold you against your will. That's it. Yeah? Okay, so... I ask you a question and you have to answer with the first thing that comes to your mind. - See? - Okay. Okay. Rose, the one thing you want most in your life. My green card. - A green card? - Well, it's everything to me. - Why everything? - (SIGHS) If I get it, I'll feel safe, okay? (CHUCKLES) You're not safe now? (SCOFFS) I'm a Mexican living in the US. I'm a slave. They can take me away from my son any time. (SIGHS) I love Mexico. (CHUCKLES) Been there? Acapulco. Papaya margarita! - (CHUCKLES) So good! - You know, that's not real Mexico. - What's real Mexico? - That's hotel Mexico. That's Mexico for the pinches gringos.

Tennis. - (SUCKS TEETH) - A pro athlete? Mm, yeah. (HICCUPS) I... I played a... I played a tournament today, you know? Mm. But I lost. I lost. (SIGHS) First round. (SNORTS) Mm-hmm. I lose all the time, Rose. I let everybody down. _ Huh? "Boris. Boris, you win! You win for them, Boris!" (SPEAKING CROATIAN) I can't, aef... (SOBBING) I can't fucking... Okay? I can't.

(VOMITING, COUGHING) (COUGHING) (PANTING) (GROANING) (WHIMPERS) (GUNFIRE, EXPLOSIONS) (GUNFIRE, EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE) (MAN SPEAKING CROATIAN) I'm running. (GUNFIRE) Uncle! - (SPEAKING CROATIAN) - (MAN SHOUTING IN CROATIAN) (BABY CRYING) (IMITATES GUNFIRE) (SPEAKING CROATIAN) Do bazenu! Bazenu Sam! Ja bazenu Sam! (SIGHS) Good morning, Boris. What happened? You were very sick last night. Oh. What... what time is it? 7:00. (GRUNTS) Boris, what's a bazenu? You kept yelling, "Bazenu, bazenu." (SIGHS) Huh. Bazenu, huh? I was... I was six when the Serbs came. I'll never forget. My uncle was teaching me to play tennis to become star. Age five. (CHUCKLES) There was no tennis court near where we lived. But there was a pool, bazenu. You know, empty. No water. So he taught me to play in it. And then when planes came with bombs, we drilled a hole in it and, uh... hole in the middle and made it into shelter... (SNIFFS) ...so I could hide in it. We could hear them, you know, dropping overhead. So bazenu saved me. My uncle saved me. Tennis saved me. My cousins, my parents... they... they were taken. They were put on a bus, taken to a farm, and then... they killed them. So, your uncle is the boss? He took me in, he... kept me fed, took me to Russia to train. (SUCKS TEETH) I play tennis to try and pay them back. But fail. (CHUCKLES) Either I dream or I so drunk last night. (CHUCKLES) You were very drunk last night. No, I... in my dream... - Mm. - I... (CHUCKLES) I was... I was giving a lot of toys to kids, you know, children. They were smiling, laughing. (BOTH CHUCKLING) I was Santa. It made me so happy. Mm. I'm sorry about what happened to you. - What? - Your family. Lo siento. No one's ever said that. We don't talk about them. You know, Boss's rules. (SNIFFLES) - Salud, señorita. - (CHUCKLES) - (KNOCKING ON DOOR) - (SIGHS) If that's my boss, I have to hide. Mm, I cover for you. - Who is it? - MAN: My name is Edgar. I'm so... I'm sorry to bother you, but I stayed here the night before last and I think I forgot something in my room. I tried calling the front desk, but there was no answer. What, um... what are you looking for? It's a red Santa suit. I was in a hurry to get to my next gig and I just forgot it. Shucks, I was already on the bus halfway to Tippecanoe when I remembered, so I... well, I thought I'd just come by this morning, give it a shot. - Is this your Santa suit? - Oh, yes. - ROSE: I see. - These things are really expensive. Otherwise, I'd have a backup. I'd hate to have to replace it. Sure, of course. Here. You see, Boris here would like to buy it from you. - Do you think that's possible? - Oh, I... I'm sorry. It... it's not for sale. I had it specially fit for my fat butt. (CHUCKLES) (ALL CHUCKLING) Are you sure? $300. No, I wish I could, but I have a bunch of kids that are counting on me. It's okay. Much obliged. Merry Christmas, folks. (CHUCKLES) Can I buy you coffee? I have to pick up my son. - What's his name? - Jesus. - "Hey, Zeus"? - Yeah, spelled like Jesus. Ah, cool, cool, cool, cool. - So I met Jesus's mom. - (CHUCKLES) Well, good luck, Boris. Hey, Rose. Here, one second. For Jesus. Even if he'll never play, at least it will make a good story, you know? It's okay, you don't have to give us anything. Rose. (SIGHS) You helped me. I don't know what to say. Goes on your shoulder. (CHUCKLES) (DOOR CLOSES) (SNIFFLES, SIGHS) (MUSIC PLAYING) Time to go back to the cows, Kimmy.
