 - He doesn't sing in public. - I'm sorry. [Emily] I can't talk to you, Damon. Don't call me. Don't contact me. And don't come to the Invitational. I think it's best if we stop dating. I want you to be happy. I love you both. [up-tempo music plays] * This a big one right here * Lauren, you had one of the worst performances of your career last month in Beijing. What happened?

 I was competing with a severe case of the stomach flu. I am here with Sara Columbo, Rock Team member. - Sara, are you nervous? - I'm, um, Emily Kmetko. - Who? - Everyone knows, no American gymnast, not even the healthy ones, medaled on beam against China. But tomorrow I will be the first. Emily Kmetko. I'm on the National Team. [speaking foreign language] My back's a hundred percent but I'm not up to competition level yet. So although I won't be competing tomorrow, I'll be on the floor supporting my teammates. - Any plans for Nationals next year? - Just to win it. Yes, we know who you are.

 You are the one everyone thinks doesn't belong. Yeah. Hey. The Chinese will be here any minute and Kaylie's still not here. She told me last night she was doing the meet. Could something have changed her mind...? - She'll be here. OK. [M.J.] You're doing the right thing, Kaylie. This is a non-sanctioned meet. You're under no obligation to lose your status or your endorsements just to have the backs of your teammates. Especially when the only thing they have in my back is a knife. Well, not all of them. This is ultimately an individual quest for the Gold. Your teammates may act like your friends, but everyone is looking out for number one. You should do the same. Funny, that's what my dad said. Wow. For once we agree. - Where is your father? - Taking his own advice. Well, the National Committee and I have your back. I wonder what the Chinese will do when they find out they came all the way to Boulder and the US National Champion isn't even gonna compete? That's not your problem. I want you to lay low. Don't answer the phone. I don't want you talking to the press or your friends until this blows over. You don't owe anyone an explanation. OK? Ladies, remember, the Chinese prefer to shake hands very lightly and they lower their eyes as a symbol of respect. Let's do the same so we don't appear rude. Talk about rude, the National Champion isn't even here to greet them. Yeah, I know. Where is Kaylie? I can't believe she's late. [pop music playing] There's Genji Cho! That's Genji Cho? She looks like a kid. Don't be fooled, they're machines. They take them away from their parents and the little gymbots are practically forced to do gymnastics around the clock, every single day. It's all they know. [whispering] Let's go! Are we still sure Kaylie's coming? - Yeah. It's all over, Belov. Kaylie's not doing the meet. I'm glad I'm here to see you cancel this little ego trip of yours. Your girls would've been decimated anyway. Excuse me. I have an announcement to make. I've just been told that Kaylie Cruz will not be competing in the meet tomorrow. - [indistinct murmuring] - [Sasha] So... ...as a result, Rachel Colter will be competing in her place. [indistinct chatter] - Coach, do you feel this will affect your chances? And now, I'd like to introduce Coach Kai-Yung Tseng and his honorable team to Boulder and to The Rock. [light applause] We did not travel 7,000 miles to compete against your second string, Mr. Belov. Even without Kaylie Cruz, I assure you, this team will give you a fight. And I assure you, we will bury your team. And then, I will bury you. Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com [Carter] She's probably wigged about the Invitational tomorrow. - Give her a little time. - That's just it, I don't have time. The prize for the contest is a European tour. And I leave tomorrow, after the radio show. - For how long? - Six months. But I can't leave without trying to work this out or saying goodbye. But she said she didn't want to see me or talk to me, and I have to respect that, right? I've been dying to text her and call her all day, but she's got a huge day tomorrow, I don't want to get in the way. But she might feel differently if she knew you were leaving the country tomorrow for half a year. How about a letter? You can pin it by her paycheck. She's coming by later to pick it up. That's good. I can write down how I feel and what's going down and she can decide what she wants to do without any pressure. And if you want my opinion, now's not the time to hold anything back. Yeah, I can give you the same advice. [chuckling] [indie rock music plays] [knocking on door] No! You have to hear us out. Get her and get out. - Please, Kaylie. You gotta let us explain. Explain what? That you've been sneaking up to Lauren's garage apartment - to have sex this whole time? - He was just living up there. That's all. You've been living at Lauren's? - My dad kicked me out. - He was living in his car. - Why didn't you tell me? - What would you have done? You didn't care when Carter got kicked out of the gym and couldn't compete at Nationals, all to save your career. Why would you care if he was homeless? I let you back into my life under one condition: that you'd have nothing to do with Carter! And you lied to me. Again. But then why does that surprise me? - You're nothing but... - That's enough! Seriously, Kaylie. She was being a friend when I had no one. And you shouldn't use this to pull out of the China meet. - You're defending her? - Please, Kaylie. We need you. No. You only need me because you'll do better with me than without me. But guess what? This time I'm looking out for myself. We're done here. Let's go. Please, Kaylie. - You've gotta believe me. - Goodbye, Carter. [grunting] Her people are telling her to stay away from The Rock. [sighing] I'm glad her loyalty is with her "people," then. She respects you, Emily. As a teammate and a friend. She doesn't want to let you down but she thinks she's got too much to lose - if she competes. - [scoffing] That's what she told me to tell you. Do you know what I'm losing? My scholarship. - Almost half of my family's income. - Man, that's awful. What happened? - The National Committee found out I have a job. What are you gonna do? I don't know. I don't know how we're going to make it. But, I've come too far to be passed over. Gymnastics is my life and I'm not gonna let anyone... ...or anything get in my way. Damon? I should never have been seeing anybody in the first place. Where is my mother? Do you need a ride home? I came to ask you a favor. Because of my mistake, my husband is AWOL and Kaylie is in a terrible place. Of course, she doesn't want to listen to anything I have to say, but... I think she's getting some bad advice. - So do I. So, could you please come and talk to her? I think I've said everything I could to her, Mrs. Cruz. Please? We need you. Right now, you're the only man in her life. - You're it. - [sighing] [rock music plays] Hey, Carlos. This is my friend Leo. - Hey. - Hey. I just gotta grab some stuff from my locker. - OK. - Ready? Yeah, I just have to get my check. All right. Ready. Belov. What do you want? I want you to go home and talk to your daughter. You want her to compete, you talk to her. You're the coach. And you're the father. You're the one she needs right now. So why don't you wrap up this little pity party you've been throwing for yourself and act like a father. [sighing] This is exciting. It's really happening. - Yeah, we did it. - You did it. I do have a question about the scoreboard, though... What about it? - China's our opponent. Not the National Committee. - Ellen Beals will go ballistic. - And the problem is...? I have to admit. Going rogue is kind of fun. I think I'm gonna go back to my old landing. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I can do that one perfectly. This thing is stressful enough, I just don't think it's a good idea to go too far out of my comfort zone. I can't believe Kaylie bailed. I'd feel so much better if you were competing. I'm not ready. Can I tell you a secret? I still can't go on bars. I tried, but since I got hurt I haven't been able - to touch them. - You will. Can I tell you a secret? [inhales] The other night, I said "I love you" to someone for the first time. Wow! Talk about going out of your comfort zone. If you can do that, I mean, this should be... - ...I'm just sayin'. - [chuckling] So, your husband won't be joining us? He wanted to, but he got called out of town. Business. - In that case, I'll just get to it. - Oh, look! You're back! - Sorry, everyone. Hope I didn't miss anything. Hey, kiddo. - Hi! - So, what's this all about? Just a long-overdue visit. I realized I'd never told you and your wife how much all of us on the National Committee appreciate Kaylie. She's a real asset. To both her country and her team. If I was such an asset, why didn't I go to Beijing? Because Beijing was unwinnable. It was in everyone's best interest to protect you. You understand, I'm sure, Alex, as you were a star athlete. - You have to pick your battles. - Hm-hm. The world needs to see you as a winner, Kaylie. You couldn't have won in China. I wish your coach understood that, but he doesn't. We're the ones who have your back here, not Coach Belov. - We all appreciate it. - You're lucky to have Alex as a dad. You don't get to be a major league phenomenon like your father unless you understand how the game is played. On and off the field. Thanks for coming by, Ms. Beals. It's a great comfort knowing that Kaylie has someone looking out for her. What a pompous ass. Who does she think she is, coming into my home telling us that you're not good enough to win a Gold medal against the Chinese? Why aren't you competing today? The National Committee doesn't want me to, and my sponsors and my manager are freaked out, and I don't trust... certain members of my team. You're a gymnast. An elite athlete. None of those are reasons why you shouldn't go out there and do what you're born to do. So, what's really stopping you? - No one thinks I can win. - What do you think? - I think they're right. - [Ronnie] Kaylie... Nationals was supposed to be this huge validation for me, but practically the second I won, everybody was saying that it a fluke. And ever since the day I got the title? I've been terrified of the day that I have to prove it wasn't a fluke. So, what, you're gonna just run away? Quit gymnastics altogether? I can't. I was born to do this. Then go do it. You're gonna have to face that fear someday, it might as well be today. [dance music plays] Here they are, the Chinese National Team. The best in the world, and some say, ever assembled. [applause] [male announcer] And here come the young women from the Rocky Mountain Gymnastics Training Center. Perhaps the gutsiest team ever assembled. [female announcer] Some people are calling them the craziest. To do this meet, especially without Kaylie Cruz? You girls look nervous! I will give you one thing. When you decide to go down in flames, you girls go big. [male announcer] Let the games begin. [speaking in Chinese] Do you know why younger gymnasts have an advantage over older gymnasts? It's not because they're more flexible or stronger. It's because they're more fearless. - But I believe that... - [audience cheering] [audience murmuring] [male announcer] Things are getting very interesting here. It looks like National Champ Kaylie Cruz is back in the line-up for The Rock. Kaylie, we had a deal. - My daughter doesn't make deals with the devil. Coach Belov? I want to compete today. I think we can arrange that. And I'd like to talk to my team, if that's OK with you? You are the team leader. [female announcer] It looks like Kaylie Cruz, the team captain, wants to give her team the pep talk. You want to know the real reason I disappeared? I was afraid. I was afraid that I was going to come out here and choke, and that my National win really was a fluke. I know you guys are afraid, too. But we each have something bigger than our fear. We have each other. Not sure what Kaylie is telling her teammates right now, but they look like they're getting fired up. Guys, we're more than a team. We're a family. Those girls out there aren't allowed to have lives, so they don't have distractions. We do. And we have our issues. With our parents. With boys. With each other. That's part of being a family. And yeah, we have our fear. But you know what? It's OK to have fear because that means you have passion. But just for today, we're gonna leave the fear in here, and we're gonna take that passion out there, onto that floor. Where this Rock Family is gonna go, right now, - and kick some serious ass. - [all] Yeah! - [Lauren] Let's do this! - [Kaylie] Ready? - One, two, three... - [all yelling] Rock on! [cheering] [* We Are Family plays] [audience cheering] [male announcer] That's why they call these girls renegades. The contrast between these teams couldn't be clearer. [female announcer] The first rotation will be vault and floor exercise. The Rock is looking to get five medals today to beat the performance of the National team in Beijing. * As we walk on by * * And we fly just like birds of a feather * * I won't tell no lie * - * All of the people around us they say * - [cheering, applause] * Can they be that close? * [male announcer] The Chinese are off to an amazing start. They might as well stop looking up. Their names aren't gonna be on that board all day. [male announcer] Here she is... Genji Cho. Americans who have never seen this athlete compete before are in for a shock. She is in a league of her own. She won every Gold medal in Beijing last month. [up-tempo music plays] [female announcer] I'm frankly speechless. A three-and-a-half twist? Who does that? That was absolutely incomparable. You've got to feel a little sorry for Kaylie Cruz right now. She's the gymnast that has to follow that. - [music stops] - [applause] [male announcer] What a stunning performance! Genji Cho has taken the lead on the floor exercise! [exhaling] - [male announcer] This is Kaylie's first appearance in a competition of this magnitude since Nationals. It's time for her to show the world what she's really made of. [female announcer] A beautiful routine! Kaylie Cruz has upped her game since Nationals. [female announcer] As predicted, Genji Cho gets the Gold. But The Rock's Kaylie Cruz just won the Silver on floor. [male annocer] Giving The Rock its first medal of the day! That was very good, Kaylie... for you being so old. [girls giggling] All right, come on, team, let's keep it going! [applause] - OK? - [sighing] You can medal in this, Emily. You've trained hard. I'm gonna do it. I'm doing the blind landing. And I'm gonna nail the blind landing. That'a girl. No more fear, Emily. Trust. [sighing] - Go, Em! - You got this! [pop music plays] [male announcer] This is the first time Emily Kmetko has attempted this vault. It's a new vault for her, it's a Yurchenko one-and-a-half. Trust. * Yeah * [cheers and applause] * The one nobody loves * * Don't give me, nobody loves * - [Sasha laughing] - Whoo! [male announcer] She nailed it! Emily Kmetko wins the second medal of the day for The Rock! Yeah! [female announcer] Emily is another athlete who had something big to prove today. And it looks like she just did! We're moving on to the next rotation: bars and beam. China will kick things off, followed by The Rock. Here's Genji Cho, on bars. [male announcer] Genji Cho is just flawless today. It's apparent why no one has yet beaten her. [applause] That's as close to perfect as you're gonna get. And here's the score. Amazing! Sasha Belov's strategy has got to pay off, right here. He's counting on Kaylie Cruz to medal on bars, and Lauren Tanner to medal on beam. They're both up, right now. [* Superchick: Hey, Hey] * Some people you can never please * * You might as well just let them be * * They mock everything not their own * * From their imaginary throne * * But I won't bow down * * Even if the whole world thinks I'm crazy * * So, hey, hey this song is for us * * So put your hands in the air * * If you're crazy like us Hey, hey * * Hey, hey That's freedom you hear * * Coming right to your ear * * That's the sound from our bus * * Hey, hey * * Hey, Hey! * * Hey, Hey! * * Hey, Hey! * * Hey, Hey! * * Hey, Hey! * - [cracks] - [cheers and applause] All right! Go, Kaylie! That's a stunner. Kaylie Cruz did not break the top three on bars. And this is really gonna hurt The Rock. And here's Lauren Tanner's score on beam... - Excellent! - [cheers and applause] [groaning] - [female announcer] But, is she limping? She is. Lauren Tanner is hurt. - [gasping] - [audience murmuring] Damn it! [sighing] You're on bars next. How do you feel? I'm fine. [male announcer] Well, this is a big problem for The Rock. With Kaylie Cruz not medaling on bars, Sasha Belov needed Lauren Tanner to do so. And now it looks like she may be done for the day. [female announcer] Hard to see, given the lineup, how The Rock can get that fifth medal now. His alternate hasn't even been in an international competition before. Payson. You're in. - Me? - You. You're cleared to do gymnastics, let's go. But I'm working my way back with simple routines. It will never be enough to medal. Rachel wouldn't medal, either. But you will inspire your team to do the impossible. Sasha. I haven't been on the bars since my injury. I... I can't. I'm... I'm so afraid of them. - You've got this, Pay. - You can do it, Payson. Payson, you were here to help me do this and now I'm here for you. Come on. [* Caitlyn Smith: Crushed and Created] * Looking back on the things that found me * * Places that * * We'd never choose * * The same things that both haunt and heal * * My demons and my muse * * We are crushed and created * * And we are melted and made * * We are broken and built in the very same way * * What I thought I could handle * [male announcer] You are about to witness history in the making. Payson Keeler is about to perform for the first time since what we thought was a career-ending injury. [sighs] - Trust. - Trust. What are you waiting for? You can do this. * And I'm wiser * * And I'm stronger * * We are crushed and created * * And we are melted and made * * We are broken and built in the very same way * * What I thought I could handle * * What I thought I could take * * What I thought would destroy me * * Leaves me stronger, stronger... * - [applause and cheering] - Whoo-hoo! Yeah! - [Emily] You did it, Pay. - [Kylie] Yes. - Yeah! - [Lauren] Awesome, Pay. - * What I thought I could handle * - Good job. * What I thought I could take * * What I thought would destroy me * [male announcer] It's odd to see the great Payson Keeler do such a simple routine but, I've... I've never seen her look better. The Rock looks more fired up than we've ever seen them. Will this rattle Genji Cho? [rock music plays] [applause] [male announcer] Spectacular beam by Genji Cho! It looks like she will sweep the Golds here today, just like she did in Beijing. [female announcer] Hard to see who can touch that. - Trust. - Trust. [male announcer] Emily Kmetko is the last gymnast up on the bars. She is trying to give The Rock its fourth medal of the day, tying the number of medals won by the National Team won in Beijing. Emily Kmetko? Fat ance. [male announcer] This is a very high pressure situation for this young gymnast. [female announcer] Yeah, this is where her inexperience might be a problem for her. Just dealing with the pressure of this situation. - [heartbeats] - Trust. [audience cheering] - Oh, wow! - That was awesome! Good job! Look over there. - [cheers and applause] - [screaming] [male announcer] I think it's safe to say nobody expected Emily Kmetko to get a Silver medal on bars. [female announcer] She's walking out of here today with a Silver and a Bronze. Let's remember, that's as good as Kelly Parker did against the Chinese last month. [male announcer] I think this young woman answered any questions anyone could have had about her background, her training, or her worth as a National Team member today. And she's also proven that Sasha Belov was right. His renegade group here has just won as many medals against the Chinese as the hand-selected members of the US National Team. Kaylie Cruz is the last athlete for The Rock. If she medals on beam, The Rock will beat the US's four medals. Listen to me carefully, Kaylie. I want you to add a triple twist. I've seen you working on it. - You can do it. - Why? We have the four medals. If I j5st do my routine clean, we can probably get our five. And that would be wonderful for the team. But I'm talking about you, Kaylie. I'm talking about you going for the Gold, right now. - You think I can beat that? - Yeah, I do. Prove yourself, right here, right now. But if I don't land it, I might not medal at all. And we won't beat the National Team. But if you do? You're clearly the best gymnast in America. And you rival the very best in the world. [* Superchick: Alive] * Don't bury me I'm not yet dead * * Don't bury me I'm not yet dead * * I'm alive, I'm alive That's what I say * * I'm alive, I'm alive Gonna live that way * * I'm alive, I'm alive That's what I say * * I'm alive and I'm gonna live today... * [male announcer] We're used to Kaylie being such a crowd pleaser on the floor. Who knew you could play to the crowd on the beam? * We were born with wings * * We were made to fly * * We were made to live while we're still alive * * I'm alive, I'm alive That's what I say * * I'm alive, I'm alive Gonna live that way * - * I'm alive, I'm alive... * - [applause] [cheers and applause] Whoa! Whoo! I don't believe what I just saw. Was that a triple twist? * I'm alive, I'm alive That's what I say * * I'm alive, I'm alive Gonna live today... * [screaming, cheering] [male announcer] You are looking at the first gymnast to beat Genji Cho for Gold. [female announcer] Kaylie Cruz is the best gymnast in the US, one of the best, perhaps, that we've had. The Rock stuns the gymnastic world by winning five medals today. And someone at the National Team has a lot of explaining to do. These girls clearly should've been taken to Beijing. Kaylie had home gym advantage. She never could've done that in China. Don't let Kaylie Cruz leave before I talk with her. [female announcer] What a great job defending your title today, Kaylie. I'm no longer defending it. I'm letting it speak for itself. Emily, that was the most poised, professional performance as we've seen from you. Thanks. It felt great. For the first time, I felt really open out there. I felt fre [laughing] - Anything you want to say? - I still don't like you. - You don't have to. - It's not over, Belov. Far from it. [all laughing] [rock music plays] You must feel pretty good right now. You know what? I do. Thank you. You really helped me get here. I hope you still wanna thank me after I give you this... Where did you get this? I took it from the board when we stopped by to pick up your check. Why would you do that? To protect you. You'd just told me how important it was to focus and I didn't want anything to mess with that. So, I figured I'd hold onto the note until after the China meet. Do you really think that was your call? Maybe not. Look, I didn't read it. I'm sorry if I did the wrong thing. I was trying to help you out. * Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh * * Crack a smile but let each other know * * Even though I know * Hey. How's your ankle? How's your Gold medal on beam? Wait. I never thought you'd beat me on beam, Kaylie, but you did. I have to admit, you were amazing. - Thanks. Listen, I know you may never be able to trust me again, but there's one thing you should trust in. Carter. He loves you, Kaylie. His heart and soul belong to you. If anyone ever loved me that much, I'd find a way to forgive him for making one mistake he truly regrets. [inaudible] - Turn on the radio! - What? Why? Just turn it on to 86.7. [station buzzing] [Damon on radio] When I was in Shelter Pups I was the guy who wrote the songs. I never saw myself as a front man. You guys... That's Damon. - Where? - On the radio. [Damon] Well, what's the thing that changes everything? [male announcer] A girl. - [Damon] Believe me, this isn't just any girl. She, uh... inspires me. She made my music better. She made me better. - [announcer] I take it she's not in the picture anymore? [Damon] She's pursuing her own dreams right now. And I know she's kicking ass. [announcer] We're sitting here with Damon Young. He just won a nationwide talent search. And it says here... and I can't believe this is true, but it says that you had a phobia about singing in front of other people. - When did that end? - It's about to end now. Whoa. So this is the first time you're going to...? Sing my songs. In front of strangers. And what turned that around? Well, that would be the same girl. Two days ago I told somebody "I love you" for the first time. I've never allowed myself to fall for anyone before, to let them in. Well, I finally did. I love you Emily, wherever you are. And I'm so glad I told you, and I'm so glad I can say that, and I can sing it to the world. Letting go and loving you... ...opened me up, made me free. Free enough to do this. It made me better, too. [announcer] You're leaving for a six month European tour tonight. Let's give these people a taste of what they're gonna get. [Damon] This is for you, Emily. I thought you would've come to say goodbye. I guess you really are letting me go. But thank you... for giving me the guts to fall... ...for opening me up to life. I will never forget you. [* Paul Freeman: Tightrope] * I don't want to wait too long * * And I don't want to break it down * * The sun is sinking just like stone * * And it's hard for me to breathe * I have to go say goodbye. He's gonna think I didn't care enough to say goodbye. Go! - [Kaylie] Come on, I'll drive you! * Fear and the pain * Do what you want. Love who you want. * But I'll keep holding * * Holding * * And I'm higher before than I've ever been * * I was walking a tightrope can't you see * * But nobody wants to be alone * * I was walking a tightrope * * Can you catch me? * * If I let go * Well, go! Before it's too late, go! * The world is turning out of time * Before it's too late. * Will pull me close * * And it's all I'll ever need * [sighs] It's me. Um... I know this is crazy, but, uh, I love you. I just do. And I know you're right. We're meant to be together. So let's just put the stupid stuff behind us and be together. I want you to come to my room tonight. I'll be waiting for you. [cell phone beeps] * I was walking a tightrope * * Walking a tightrope * * Can you catch me? * * If I let go * [Damon on radio] * As far as I can see * Isn't this where Damon Young was just singing? Is there another studio? Oh, you must be Emily. You're in the right place, but it's the wrong time. I don't understand. I was just listening to him. Yeah, the show's pre-recorded. His flight left about an hour ago. I'm sorry. * Cause all we are is skin and bones * * So just keep holding Just keep holding on * * And I'm higher before th I've ever been * * I was walking a tightrope * * Can't you see? * * Nobody wants to be alone * * I was walking a tightrope * * Walking a tightrope * * Can you catch me? * * If I let go * * There's no way back * * If I let go * * You're where I'll land * * So here I go * * Cause I just want to live * * And I just want to feel it * * Oh * * I just want to feel it * * I'm higher to fall than I've ever been * * I was walking a tightrope Can't you see? * * That nobody wants to be alone * * I was walking a tightrope * * Can you catch me? * * If I let go * Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com www.tvsubtitles.net
