 I would like to be petitioned onto the National Team. Payson, you're not ready. - You'll only get one shot. - I'll be ready. Do you really think Ellen Beals wants to hurt the girls? I think she wants to control them. OK. I want Sasha Belov out. - Of The Rock? - Of the sport. You don't love me anymore? I think we're better as friends. Is there something you're not telling me? There's something you didn't get.

 You didn't get Carter. I did. This is for you, Emily. Guess you really are letting me go. He's gonna think I didn't care enough to say goodbye. Damon's in Europe. Maybe you'll get to see him. I'm going to France to compete. And only to compete. Sweetie, the only French I know I picked up from a talking candlestick in Beauty And The Beast. English, please. I was saying, "I'm not going all the way to France to be an alternate!" Yes. You are. And you will kiss Ellen Beals'... derriere, to let her know how grateful you are.

 How's that for French? Let me get this straight. If Paris is like Denver... Oh, wow. I cannot wait to see where this is going. - And Calais is like Boulder... - Not remotely, but OK. - And even though Damon's gonna be performing in Denver... - Paris. - And you're going to be competing in Boulder... - Calais. You're still not gonna try to see him? Mom, Ellen Beals went out on a limb to get me a sponsorship. I'm not gonna risk losing it. I know. You're right. But, it's Paris. How romantic would that be? Hi, Mr. Tanner. Hey, Kaylie. Uh, is there something going on with you two? She gets one stupid magazine cover and thinks she doesn't need her old friends anymore. Yeah, well, friends can be overrated. And time consuming. It wouldn't hurt you to focus a little more on your gymnastics anyway. What's that supposed to mean? It means Kaylie's number one in the country. You can't even beat Emily for number two here at The Rock. Hey, Bob... can I get your input on something? You got a minute? Alternate or Olympic contender? It's up to you, Lauren. She's walking with death I know it's eight hours later in France, but call me. As soon as you know anything. I don't care what time it is. OK, I will. We all want the same thing for our kids, the opportunity to win an Olympic medal. Am I right? - It's the only reason we're here. - I've got some ideas. But this isn't the time or place. I'm having a little get-together. We can nosh... watch the girls on TV.... Look. I'm sorry I told you about Carter that way. I was upset. I know you're mad, but I really hope we can... I'm not mad. I'm relieved. I can finally focus on what's really important, winning the all-around Olympic Gold Medal in 2012. You should know, we're having sex. Great. Maybe now you'll get a magazine cover. I heard about the viewing party. Just wanted you to know we'll be there. Perfect, but keep it on the down low. It's just for the A-listers. - You're having a party? - It's more... business. - Well, did I make the A-list? - Of course. Emily's the number two girl at the gym. You're more like an A-plus. Em, sit with me. Number one and two have to stick together. Oh, my gosh! Green Day is going to be in Paris! Damon's gonna be less than an hour from Calais! - Emily are you going to see him?! - No. Emily understands that boys are a distraction if you want to stay focused on gymnastics. Right, Em? I think Emily understands you can have gold medals and true love. Itineraries and contacts for the girls. Oh, thank you. You know, I'm so happy that you're back at The Rock. You know, I really missed it. Oh, I was thinking I might throw a viewing party for the girls at my house, to watch them on TV. - What do you think? - Can't. Sorry. Working. - Sorry. - You? Uh... No. Me, too. Sorry. OK. Payson? Are you certain you want to do this? The committee will only give you one shot. - I'll work with you. In a couple months... - I'm ready now. Kaylie thinks just because we have boyfriends, we can't be as good as her. But we'll prove her wrong, right? We girls with boyfriends need to stick together. Since when do you have a boyfriend? You mean Kaylie didn't tell you Carter and I are together now? - What? When did this happen...? - Can we drop it? I'm going to France as the number one gymnast in the country and that is better than any boyfriend. Now, can we stay focused on what we need to do? Unless, of course, you're an alternate, in which case, you won't be doing much of anything. I can't believe it. We're really in France. Oui. Tres fantastique. - That means... - We all know what that means. Loose translation: "I'm a pretentious show-off." Kaylie, may I have your autograph? Yeah, sure. Must be tough. It used to be you, right? Do you want my autograph? I'm on the US National team. No. Merci. They're French. They can be so rude. Austin Tucker? Didn't he say he won Worlds with the worst hangover of his life? No. I'm pretty sure that was his Olympic gold medal. Does it even matter? He treats gymnastics like a joke. All he cares about is partying and hanging out with celebrities. ...over till it's over You've got to be kidding me. Wow, we are staying in the same hotel as Austin Tucker. - We should say hi. - You know him? We're on the National Team. I think he knows who we are. Hi, Austin? Hi... Um... We haven't met, but... - Where do you want me to sign? - How about right here? - Oh, no. I'm not a fan. Maybe we can do something about that. See, I've got this thing tonight. Maybe you want to come along? - No... Well, I just... I have plans. - That was priceless. - Wow! Wow! Addic7ed And iSubs Present: Synced By YesCool Addic7ed.com iSubs.Tk make it or break it season 2, episode 2 - ALL OR NOTHING There you are. Welcome, girls. Good flight, I hope. - Yes, Ms. Beals. - Good. I've already checked you in. Why don't you go up to your rooms and try to get some sleep? We slept on the plane. We thought we'd do a little sight-seeing. Absolutely not. You will not leave your rooms. Let's not forget why we're here: To compete. To represent our country. Kaylie, as team captain, I'm counting on you to make sure everyone follows the rules. Sleep well. I expect to see you all looking sharp at practice in the morning. Shouldn't we check in with Marty? Oh, you didn't hear? Marty's on a leave of absence. Pending committee review. Oh, so who's gonna be our....? I'll be supervising your very capable assistant coaches, allowing me a chance to get to know you all so much better. Aren't we all glad we're on her good side now? You're welcome. I'm starting to get a complex. I've asked a dozen parents to come to my house on Sunday and watch the meet and all of them are busy. - All of them. - Well, you didn't ask me. Well, um, Summer, would you like to come to my house - on Sunday and watch the meet? - Sorry. I have plans. - Seriously. Sasha's working Sunday. I have to be here. Why don't you watch with us? Maybe I will. I have to admit, it's so good to be working again. It makes me feel connected. You know, you could be even more connected, if you wanted. The Parents Board. They're electing a new president. No. It's way too political for me. Besides, isn't Alex running again? Actually, no. And you'd be great. You're sweet, but the answer's still no. I'd like to keep these parents as my friends. - Bye. - See ya. I still can't believe that jerk acted like he didn't know me... us. Austin Tucker... undercover. I'm pretty sure he wasn't acting. I still can't believe we're stuck in this hotel. No, it's good. Like Beals said, we need to stay focused. And we only have one day to practice. Fine. But I don't need to be locked up to focus. If I was at home I'd be working, or hanging with Brian, or something. I feel like I'm going to hyperventilate. We could all go to Paris. There's trains leaving every hour. You do know that Ellen Beals is gonna be coming around for a bed check, right? She's gonna be watching our every move. I don't mean now. We can go tomorrow night. We could all go see Damon and Green Day. And Emily, you'd love Paris. The night before a competition? Are you crazy? We wouldn't have to stay out late. So go. You're an alternate. - You won't be missed. - Enough, OK? No more sniping. Does France have something against cold beverages? - I'll get ice. - Thanks. Do you think Damon's gonna be mad you didn't come to see him? He doesn't even know I'm here. Well, I guess there's really no point in seeing him. With all his fans and groupies... - I'm sure he's moved on. - Party's gonna be great. Hey, don't I know you? No. No, I think we have very clearly established that you do not know me. I knew it. We met in front of the hotel. Where we also established that you are not a fan of mine. But, we didn't establish why. Seriously? Did you hit your head on a dismount? A lot, actually. Why? What am I missing? I'm Kaylie Cruz! The Women's National Champion. That's it! You're one of the Rock Rebels! - So you do know us. - Know you? I love you! That thing against China? Very cool. Oh, well... Thank you. Let me make it up to you. Come to a party with us? Party? Your coach doesn't care if you go out? The better question is... do I? And I don't. Rules are for people with no self-discipline. Well, I can't. I'm... - I'm busy. - Of course you are. That's why I don't date gymnasts. Tomorrow, you'll share this venue with teams from France, Germany and Romania. But for the next 90 minutes, it's all yours. So use your practice time wisely. If it's all ours, what is he doing here? Distracted much? No. OK, let's go, people! Tick-tock. Before they push you out I guess it's automatic It's definitely dramatic Do you really love it? Do you really love? Do you really love it? Do you really love? Do you really love it? Do you really love Good. Very good, Lauren. And I never miss it. You know, I was thinking. Maybe one of the other girls can go as an alternate... It's too late for that, Lauren. You only compete if someone gets hurt. - Or breaks the rules. - I suppose there is that. And all encircled for 80s melody New shoes all a-glowin' Onto the catwalk But tell me all about it If you lose a few pounds, that'll be easier for you, Kaylie. Do you really love? Do you really love it? - Got it. - Do you really love? Do you really love it? Do you really love? Do you really love it? Payson, I haven't seen your double pike yet. - It's not compulsory. - I'm afraid it is. They added it. Is that gonna be a problem? No. No problem. I can do it. Good. Watch your hand positions. Check this out. I pulled it off the Internet. Damon and some girl. Probably just a fan. It must be like that every place he goes... Girls just throwing themselves at him and... I wouldn't know. Fingertips are fumbling... Guess you can't really blame him if he hooks up with anyone. It's not like he ever heard from you. As far as he knows, you just blew him off. Do you really love it? - It's OK. Do you really love? Do you really love it? Do you really love? I'm sorry. I'll try that again. No do-overs tomorrow, Emily. We need your focus here. Whatever's distracting you... deal with it. We need you at your very best tomorrow. - What do you want? - Uh, Subway Club. I need lean meat and complex carbs for tomorrow. You think that will help your layout lay out? Veggie Delite on whole wheat. My last five. - Where is Payson? - She's still practicing her double pike. - Hey, guys. - Hi, Nastia. - Hey, Champ. Nice work in Boston. - Thanks. Just trying to follow in your footsteps. Tell Payson I said hello. I heard she's petitioning. Yeah. She looks really great, too. - It'll be good to have her back. - Yeah. Well, stay focused and keep eating right. Work hard. That's how I won my gold medal. - Thanks. - Bye. Wow! Nastia Luikin. - She's so cool! - Yeah, she's a great girl. She won the gold medal. Because she works harder than anyone I know. True. What about Lindsey Vonn? She doesn't just have a boyfriend, she has a husband. And a gold medal. Did it ever occur to you that the love and support from a boyfriend might actually make you better? - No. - Well, I know I wouldn't have survived Nationals if it weren't for Damon. He brought Brian, and walked me through my freak out. Having him there... He's the reason I made the National Team. You don't seriously believe that? Not only that, he wrote a song for you. He dedicated it to you on the radio. And you never even said goodbye. No wonder you're distracted. Emily is choosing to focus on what matters most: her gymnastics. Why can't I choose both? I could leave for Paris this afternoon and be back by curfew. All I would do here is go crazy in my hotel room for 15 hours. As Team Captain, I can't even let you consider that. As Team Captain, you have to help bring out the best in everyone. Emily needs closure with Damon. It's no different than you cutting off Carter at Nationals. You said it yourself. Saying goodbye to Carter is practically how you won. You're going to say goodbye? And you think this will help? - To Paris. And from Paris. - Merci. One round-trip ticket. - Is Emily still upstairs, getting ready? - Yeah. Well, tell your new BFF not to miss the 7:00 train from Paris. That should give her plenty of time for curfew. Why are you being nice? Because I believe in love. Whatever. I'm still not sure... Stop. You need Emily to bring her "A" game. We both know how inconsistent she can get when she's distracted. And this will focus her. All alone We'll make a place Where we can die together  Where the miles between us They fall apart No matter what you're doing No matter where we are We can see the same stars in the sky  And never be  Apart  I must be dreaming. - You sounded... God, I don't want to wake up. So, why are you suddenly becoming more social? Because I've decided to run for President of the Parents Board. That means I need the support of parents with influence. Parents, like you and me, who have genuine Olympic contenders. I thought maybe it was for us. To get more involved in the community together. About that. I think we should downplay the "us." For now. If people know we're together, they'll spend so much time talking about us, they won't listen to us. Let's keep this special... between us. You're an insider now. Playing the politics comes with the territory. If we have a secret alliance, we'll get everything our way and no one's the wiser. A secret alliance. Of insiders. I like it. I'm so proud of you. You did exactly what you said you would do. And you did it your way. Without selling out. And look at you, competing in France, ranked third. Where have you been? Why haven't I heard from you? I tried. I mean, I got your note late. When I heard you on the radio, I ran to the studio to say goodbye, but you were already gone. OK... And after that? I called. I did. Your cell doesn't work in Europe. And after that, I started about 1,000 e-mails that I never sent. Why not? It just felt lame to say goodbye in an e-mail. And then I realized that... ...I just didn't want to say goodbye. - Then don't. - Come on, Damon. We have to say goodbye. You know that. That's why we're here. - No... - Look... I have to be completely committed to my training schedule until the 2012 Olympics. Yeah, well, I don't. I can be there for you, I can support you. Part of this whole dream coming true for you is the whole experience, you know? I want you to have that. I want you to have it all. I can't let you stay holed up for two years waiting for me. That is not fair. For you to really have your dream, and for me to really have my dream... ...we have to say goodbye. Say it. Say it first. Come on, for me. I can't do it. Goodbye... Emily Kmetko. Goodbye, Damon Young. Hey, how did it go? Did you nail the double pike? Yeah. So that's good. You're ready for tomorrow. Where's Emily? What? It's romantic and has great pastries and it rhymes with Ferris. No she didn't! She did not go see Damon in Paris?! - She had to. - Had to? To say goodbye. To get him out of her head. She doesn't have our focus, Payson. We were just trying to make the best of a bad situation. A bad situation? That's what you're gonna call this? What kind of leader are you? How could you let her do this? What if her train is late? Or Ellen Beals catches her? She could get suspended! Let's just pray that doesn't happen. - One way. - No, no. Round trip. Calais. No, mademoiselle. One way. You must buy a ticket for Calais. But I don't have any money. Please? Where are you? This is ridiculous. I'm going to my room and I'm going to sleep. I don't know about the rest of you, but I have a really big day tomorrow. This is why you don't run around the night before a meet. It's not Kaylie's fault. It's Emily's. We planned it so she'd be back in plenty of time. She probably stayed too long with Damon. Would everyone just chill? She'll be here. - Who is it? Ellen Beals. May I come in? Just a minute! We have to cover for Emily. We? I didn't tell her to go. Shouldn't you two be in your own room? - We were just leaving. Yeah. - Mm-hmm. Everything OK here, Lauren? Oh yes, Ms. Beals. Emily's in the shower. She says it relaxes her. Oh, that's all right. I'll check back later. Awesome. Merci. Merci. Merci. Hey, aren't you one of the Rock Rebels? Um... Yeah. Emily. Thought so. Any idea where the train to Calais boards? - Over there. - Cool, thanks. Wait! Please don't leave. Um... I need money for a ticket. I'll pay you back. I promise. Sorry, but my mom taught me, "Neither a borrower nor a lender be." Oh, what the hell? One Euro? No, you don't understand. I need to get to Calais now. I'm late. And in really big trouble. Sorry, but a flip and a tuck is worth a Euro. Now a full twist... That could get you a ticket. OK. Fine. One ticket to Calais. Thank you. So what are you doing in Paris? - Green Day concert. - Really? Did you see the opening act? Damon Young? Yeah, he was awesome. I know him. He's my... - Was... - You know him? Is he always that intense? He could not stop talking or singing about some chick Emily... Emily. You're Emily. He was upset? A bit of a train wreck. The girls went nuts for it. So what did you do to him? Come on, you know as well as I do that we can't win gold unless we're totally dedicated. We have to give it 100 percent. I don't know that at all. Loving life, living large... All that makes my gymnastics better. I did the right thing, saying goodbye to Damon. Gymnastics is my priority. It's my life. You gotta go with your gut. So, that means you're single, right? Thanks again. I swear I'll pay you back. I'll take a hug as collateral. Hello, Emily. Austin. Two of you having a nice night? You're ready for this, Pay. You've done the work. You're strong. You're focused. Now, just go out there and let it rip. Thanks, Kaylie. I just wanted to say good luck. There's no way the Committee can keep you off the National Team. You're gonna do great. Payson, the Committee is ready to see you now. And Kaylie, as team captain, you should know, Lauren will be taking Emily's place today. Whenever you're ready, Payson. These next two years are do-or-die. We need someone running that board who's dedicated to making sure everything, and that includes our coach, favors our girls' chances of being on that Olympic Team. Excuse me one sec. Honey, I... I want you to relax and enjoy yourself. - You're a guest. - OK. - Where's the powder room? - Oh, oh... I know! It's right around... I just think it's over there. - I'm just assuming. I've never been here before. Hey, everybody, grab a seat. It's on! Welcome to Calais, France. There's Lauren! Where's Emily? I don't see Emily. ...all-around Gold medalist, Nastia Liukin. Nastia, I understand you've already got some news for us. Yes. There's been a substitution on the US Team - Lauren Tanner will be competing today... - Yes! - ...in place of Emily Kmetko. - Big changes for the USA. She probably just tweaked her ankle or something. It happens all the time. Don't worry. She went all the way to France, and she doesn't even get to compete... I really appreciate your tip last night. - You did the right thing. - I was worried about her... She's never been to Paris. No telling what could've happened. Between you and me, I don't know if she's capable of sticking to the rules. It's not her. It's the way she was raised. Emily? The eyes of the world are upon you. This is your chance to show them what you're capable of. Your chance to make your country proud. USA! U-S-A! Whoo! How'd Payson do? I think she felt good. When will they make the announcement? Right after the competition. Too bad about Emily. Yeah, interesting how the alternate got in. What are you saying? You were the big cheerleader of getting Emily to Paris. Was that your plan all along? To get her benched so you could take her spot? You know what really hurts? That we've been friends since we were eight years old and you think so little of me. I can't believe you'd think I'm that conniving. I just wanted Emily to see Damon because I know what it's like to be in love. Right. And today, I will prove to you that I can have a boyfriend who absolutely adores me and still beat you. We're competing as a team, remember? Doesn't mean I can't out-score you for the all-around. You are so on. - Beat that. - Just watch me. It's on. This is a serious competition. Why did you come back? Because neither of us want to say goodbye. So then, damn it, why did we? So I could have this great dream of mine. This dream that makes me feel so happy and gives me so much joy. So come on, now. You know, I could just quit. Then we could be together. Listen, you don't mean that. I'm sick of the rules and the training and the sacrifices. And for what? To get benched because I snuck out to see a friend? I'm sick of being told what I can't do. What I can't have and who I can't have. When does my life get to be mine?! When do I get control? Listen, you have control now. You don't have to do gymnastics, it's your passion, it's who you are, you can't not do it. And all the hard work and sacrifices you've made will be worth it when you are standing on that Olympic podium in 2012. You have... You'll have your dream. But I won't have you. Who says? Listen. I have an idea. In two years, we meet here, in Paris, under the Eiffel Tower. - I'm totally serious. It's two years. It's not that long. After the Olympics, we meet here... ...and then we'll decide if it's goodbye. Is it a date? Yeah. And you'd better be wearing Gold. This is not goodbye, Emily, OK? This is... This is not goodbye. Well, Kaylie Cruz and Lauren Tanner are going neck and neck for the gold. Something seems to be fueling these two and making them better. Here's Lauren Tanner on beam. - Yes! All right! So she's not hurt? Well, I guess we'll find out what happened when they get back. Keep me posted if you hear anything. Thanks, Sasha. Well, I guess now I can see now why everyone was too busy to watch at my house. Everyone's been asking where you were. Weren't they, Steve? I wasn't sure if you were coming because you never RSVP'd to my voicemail. I wonder if I have the wrong number... Well, it's OK, because I had to work, anyway. That's why I'm here. Work. We need your signatures on these. For Lauren. Sure, sure. I know I wasn't invited, so you can cut the crap. I really don't care, but I am curious, why? You know how it is. I'm running for the Parents' Board and this little gathering is for Rock parents who have a stake in... You don't think Payson's coming back. So I don't have stake. I don't have any money, which would make me valuable at The Rock. Or a daughter who's number one anymore, so I don't count? I'm nothing to you. Is that it? - No, not nothing... - I got news for you. Payson is coming back. She's going to be petitioned on the National Team. And then she's gonna go to Worlds and the Olympics. And I'm so confident my daughter will be number one at The Rock again, I've decided to run for President of the Parent Board, too. Wait. Don't you need me to sign these, so you can take 'em back to The Rock? Take 'em yourself. Kim! Kim! They're talking about Payson! ...of Payson Keeler's petition to be on the National Team. And here is the word from the National Committee. Unfortunately, Payson's petition has been denied. She will not be joining the National Team this year. - Excuse me. - Kim... No offense, but this party sucks. The judges' final scores are being tabulated... I'm happy for every single crappy thing you've ever done to me. Because it's only made me a better gymnast. - I was better than you today. - Hmm. We'll see about that. With the all-around gold... ...from the United States of America, - US National Champ, Kaylie Cruz! - Yes! Yes! And now, taking Silver... ...from Romania, Asta Cochov! And winning the bronze... ...from the United States of America, Lauren Tanner! You've gotta be used to looking up by now, huh, Lauren? It's a shame Payson Keeler was so unprepared. I know. I told her to delay her petition, but Sasha Belov insisted. If that man's not stopped, he will ruin these girls. And team gold goes to Romania! And the USA close behind in second. We might have won the Gold, if you hadn't let your team down. I hope he was worth it. Ready or not My words grow loud Can you hear? Can you tell? I'm making sound Ready or not My heart starts to pound Can you hear? Can you tell? I'm making sound She's gonna need her coach. She's gonna need her mom. It's important you keep the dream alive... For her. I see north I see brightly Good job, girls! Congratulations! All right! Can I fall and still break free? Can I sound to you perfectly? Can I fall and still break free? Synced By YesCool!
