 Houston knows. They want payson. We've been friends for 10 years. We did everything together. Why didn't you tell me about you and Carter? Because, it's not true. T-5 T-5 Kaylie. You want to stop dragging your butt and get over here! I need to chalk up, dad. T- minus-five means my truck in five minutes, remember? Sorry, somebody beat me to the chalk box.

 Gotta go. Cambria,California Kaylie. We have got to get more height on that shushunova. - Yep. - Keep those legs straight. Ok. I thought Bela Karolyi Was a slave driver. I swear if my father doesn't find a real coach soon I'm gonna join the carnival. We're gonna need work permits, tattoos and gypsy names. Ok, no one is joining the carnival. Easy for you to say. You've have gyms begging for you. Yeah, but it's not like I want to go. I know. I just... I don't think I can do this alone if you end up in Houston. Sure you can. So, what happens if we don't have a coach? Can we not go to nationals? Without a star coach... ...You just won't be seen the same way. Kaylie! It's not called practice for nothing. - Let's see your beam. - I swear, I'm going to lose it. Coming. Excuse me! Mr. Belov? Mr. Belov? Steve Tanner. I'm sorry for just showing up like this. But, I've tried to contact you and... The reason I didn't return your call Is I have no interest in your offer. Look, it's been five years... ...Since you dropped out. You're fading into obscurity. For a man of your talents, that's gotta be hard to watch. Not if you don't watch. You expect me to believe that The coach who reinvented the sport Doesn't even watch it anymore? I don't know you Mr. Tanner So I don't expect you to believe anything. The truth is, I have no interest in gymnastics I haven't for many years. That's that. You assembled what is perhaps The greatest team in the history of sport. I think you can do it again. And I'm prepared to offer you whatever Money it takes to make that happen. You think I left England to compete In Romania because I want money? Who do I look like, David Beckham? Yes, actually, you kinda do. I'm sorry you wasted your time, Tanner. All right. Tell your daughter Lauren she's piking her layouts. It's costing her at least a tenth of a point. I thought you stopped watching gymnastics? You don't fish, do you, Tanner? - No, I... - It wasn't a question. See, fishing is all about finding the right lure. And that club team you had back at the Rock... That was the best I've seen in a decade. And then you took your daughter and My old friend Marty Walsh to Denver Look. That's... That's just it, I can get rid of Marty in Denver and... I'm not interested in Denver. If the rock was still together, We might have had something to talk about. You see, Tanner, When you broke those giris up... ...You lost your lure. Excuse me. Drive, Kaylie. Kaylie, push through. Oh, you've got to throw your head back on that ring leap! Don't forget to smile! I gotta see teeth! I can't focus with you yelling at me. And this is not a toothpaste commercial! Gee, I hope, uh... ...Hope we haven't come at a bad time? What the hell are you doing here? Now don't be that way. I come bearing gifts. Yeah, well you can get back on The Trojan Horse you rode in on. Because we don't need anything from you. Ah, but you do my friend. You need a coach. And I just happen to have the best in the business. No way we're letting Lauren back. If someone doesn't hold me back, She's gonna get my heel up her bleach blonde head. I'm not holding you back. There's no way we take you or Marty back. Who said anything about Marty? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Is that...? Sasha Belov. Make it or Break it S01E03 You think you can waltz back in here like nothing Happened just because you have Sasha Belov? Ah, yeah, Alex. I'm offering you a world class coach, people. You should be kissing my... feet. It'll be a cold day in hell before I kiss anything of yours. Now you're just hurting my feelings. Come on gentlemen, this isn't productive. What happened to Marty and Denver? Look, Lauren misses her friends here at the Rock. These giris should be together... It's Sasha Belov. What is there to discuss? This is awesome. Not if Lauren 's part of the package. - Who cares? It's Sasha Belov! - I care. Whatever happened to your foot upside her head? Kaylie! It's Sasha Belov! How do we know the next time Your daughter stomps her feet That you won't leave and take this coach with you? So, that's what it was about My daughter throwing a temper? That's exactly what it was about. I built this club at ground... No, no, no. we built this together... We're trying to get to the Olympics And you took our coach and left! Hey Chelsea. I love your new bangs. They're major. Thanks, just got 'em yesterday. You're looking good, Carter. Ah. Thanks. Where's he going? Wait. Payson. They'll be back. Mr. Belov? Mr. Belov? Wait. Where are you going? - Home. To Cambria. - Why? Because your parents seem to think They're the ones doing me a favor. Please, let us talk to them. You can't leave. You are Payson Keeler. You... you know who I am? Wait, wait. We need you here. You think you can get the grown-ups To stop behaving like children? No parents on the floor? That's a new one. Well, can you blame him? We all want the same thing. For our giris to kill at nationals And make the Olympic team. Sasha's the coach who'll get them there. So in the meantime... Can't we all just get along? - Does the man speak? - Shhh. You are all very special. You've chosen to do something few people are capable of. Look at each other. Go on, look. No one but your peers can understand what it takes To be the best gymnasts in the worid. No one. Which is why you need each other. But mostly... ...You need me. I have a few simple rules. Work as hard as I do. Care as much as I do. Sacrifice as much as I do. You will live, breathe, eat, sleep, bleed gymnastics. We have only 49 days until nationals. And you will spend every waking moment of it in this gym. Together. Go home and say goodbye to your lives as you know it. And any one of you not willing to sacrifice your blood, Sweat and tears to achieve excellence... ...Shouldn't bother to come back. We begin Monday morning, five a.m. That's all. - Five am? - He's right. We only have 49 days until nationals. And he expects us to spend every waking minute here? Where else? He is the coach that can make us great. Yeah, Payson. If he doesn't kill us first. I need a Spruce Juice fix. - Who's up for a Spruce Juice? - I'm in. That's our place. She used to be a part of... "our." Hey, Em. Payson and I are going to Spruce Juice. You in? My treat. Sure, Kay. I'd love to go. Lauren's daddy may Have bought her way back to the Rock. But she's not buying her way back into our group. Oh, you don't have to buy me my drink by the way, I know you just invited me to piss Lauren off. - No. - We didn't. It's fine. I'm happy to be of service. Cann't get over how amazing it is. I know, she's got a lot of nerve following us around. No. I was talking about Sasha Belov! We just went from having no coach To having the best coach in the worid. Who hasn't coached in five years. And who wants us to eat, sleep and bleed gymnastics. - This is gonna be... - Awesome. Happy birthday, Lauren. Thank you. Oh, that's right. Today's Lauren's birthday. My dad's taking me to Le Privilege tonight. That little French place in the foothills? Swanky. We always do something special. Just the two of us. I feel sort of bad. We used to celebrate all of our birthdays together. Whatever. Don't feel bad. It's not our fault that she's not our friend anymore. As if uber-coach wasn't stressful enough, Now we gotta train with the bitch of the beam. It sounds like Sasha's gonna be on us like bad spray tan. I'm already maxed out in the pressure department. - I need a vacation. - Check it out. Here you go, lovelies. You are cordially invited. - We're not interested. - Who says? Blast off? What's that? Only the biggest kegger of the year. ­Music, bands and all the beer you can drink. It's gonna be dope! Sounds awesome. Thanks. Let's go. We just ordered. To the kegger, Payson. No. No. We cannot go to a kegger. Why not? It's Saturday night. Our lives aren't over until Monday. Come on. Let's go do something fun for once! What's fun about a party? Oh, my god. I cannot believe you just said that. Have you ever even been to a high school party? - No. - Have you? Um, yeah, a few. - What's it like? - Well... Music, dancing... They can be a lot of fun. And they can be stupid. We could definitely use some fun. That's exactly what we don't need. What if we got caught? By who? By our new coach. - And how would he find out? - Thank you. I'm just so sick of jumping through hoops I can scream. Don't you wonder what it would be like to go to a big party? Yeah and I'm happy to keep waiting Until I'm at the Olympic village. No, Payson. This is our last chance to do something like this. - Forget it. - Fine. I'll go by myself. Or... Emily, we can go together. I mean, since you have experience and all. Come on, lets blow it out before our lives are over. Ok, yeah. I'll go. I haven't checked out the scene in Boulder. Yes! This is gonna be off the chain! Ok, I'll go. But just to keep The two of you guys out of trouble. This is gonna be so awesome! We're gonna party like the rock stars. Do you get it? - The Rock...star... - Yeah, we get it. I'm totally screwed. Fine thanks, how was your day? What? Oh, you go. Well, the good news is we have a new coach. And not just any coach. The coach. Sasha Belov. Wow. And the bad news? He wants us to train seven days and nights a week. - How am I gonna work? - Well... ...At least Ronnie Cruz got mom a job. Yeah. For as long as it lasts. What are you doing? Well, I'd like to say surfing the web But I think someone forgot to pay the phone bill. What? Merry Christmas! It's June. Well, it's better late than never! - You went shopping? - Not just for myself. For you. Voila! Oh yeah!? It's getting hot in here? Whoo! And for you my little star gazer... October sky! Your favorite movie! No, no, no. You need to take all of this stuff back. Why? Because we can't even pay the phone bill! And you've been working for exactly one day. Somebody needs to be responsible around here. Sasha Belov is an egomaniac. Aren't they all? "As a gymnast he won, in'96, the gold." Guess who he beat that year? The great Marty Walsh? Bingo. But apparently he was an even better coach. Until he dropped out for reasons unknown. They say he's the James Bond versión Of Bela Karolyi. I will never forget Karolyi Yelling at Kerrie Strugg "You can do it!" When she had a broken ankle. Or James Bond skiing off the cliff In The Spy Who Loved Me. I don't want that to be our little girl. She's not all that little. Do you ever think she was a normal teenager I'm just going to be up front. I'm going to a high school party tonight. Kaylie's driving and I'm not drinking. But if she does... ...I'll make sure I get a designated driver to bring us home. So... ...Can I go? - Yes. - Yes. But be home by... - Eleven. - Thirty. If you need us to come get you just call... - I know the drill, dad. - All right. Well, have fun. I doubt it. She's going to a party. Look at us. We're almost normal. I need refuge. My room's too close to the living room and Dad's yelling at old footage of himself playing baseball. Ok, just, close the door. Ok. I have something to ask you But you gotta promise not to say anything. How can I answer your question if I promise not to say anything? You know what I mean. All right... Is this the right outfit to wear to a kegger? You're going to blast off? You know about blast off? It was a big deal even way back in my day. Sweet. All right. What do you think? You look fine. Listen, I'm serious. Boys after four things at the kegger, Brew and booty. Then more booty and even more brew. And you deserve better than that. Leo. I'm a worid class athlete, I think I can handle a few drunken boys. Carter cell. I need to kiss you. I can be outside your window in thirty. Or inside your window in thirty- five. Dad all over me. Tomorrow night? Maybe I can sneak out? Did you tell lover boy you're going to a kegger? I don't want to hurt his feelings. And I just need a night of no pressure. So... - He's pressuring you? - No. No. Of course not. He's super supportive And totally understands I'm not ready to have sex. Too much information? It's cool. Just because I'm your brother doesn't mean We can't talk about... ...These things. However if he lay a hand on you before you are ready I'll rip his heart out. Where's mom? She went to take her stuff back. We have to be able to pay the bills, Brian. Yeah, I know. It's ok. Why didn't she take your movie back? She said it's been a long time since she's had a decent job And she just wants to be able Buy her kids something special every now and then. The phone's back on. Yeah, I know. I pay the bill, in cash. Wow. Yeah, mom. Did your sister get back, yet? Yeah, she's been in the bathroom for like, hours. - Honey, is everything ok? - Just a minute. Oh, my god. Did you get your period? Mom, gymnasts don't get their periods. Not enough body fat. But you never know. She's a young woman. Honey? You look hot! Smokin' hot! I'm going to a party. In the dress I bought you? Honey, give me a hug. I don't want you to feel guilty about this dress, okay? You were right. I took back everything that I bought myself, And I paid the phone bill. That's great, mom. Good for you. We're not gonna worry about money anymore. This job is really going to work out. Ok? Can I please... ...Put some lip gloss on you? - Ok. - Ok. Ok. Hang on. Ready? Good job. You look beautiful. She's a chip off the old block. What do you think, Brian? You two could be sisters. You know, that's what they say, "Hey, is that your sister?" Now, I need to give you some earrings. Hang on. Ok? You just made her life. Ok, you look amazing. It's my mom's. She made me wear it. At least you had something other than a Rock sweatshirt. So what do we do now, just stand here? We get beer. Right? I'm not drinking. I think we're aware of that, Payson. Thanks. Where's the keg? Probably at the end of that long line Of people holding empty cups. No, I did not come here to wait in line. Do you think there's more than one keg? Why don't you guys look over there. - I¡¦ll wait in line here. - Yeah. Ok. Wait. Do you think it's a good idea to split up? Don't worry, if you're not back in ten minutes, I'll call the national guard. Daddy, this is perfect. This is one of the best traditions we have. I love my birthday dinner. Oh, you can take away this third place setting. It's just gonna be the two of us. Actually, I invited Summer to join us. - What? - Honey, it's your birthday. You don't want to celebrate Just with your boring old dad. Besides, I'd really like you to get to know Summer. What's to know? She's your secretary. And she's practically my age. It's not like you're going to marry her. - You're not going to marry her. - No. I mean, we don't know where it's going But she's a wonderful woman And I enjoy her company. And, look... I would really appreciate it If you gave her a chance. Daddy, I don't believe you. She totally has you fooled. What makes her different than all the Other women you've blow through? She's just different. For one thing, she's smart. For another, her faith is really important to her. Are you falling for that? How much of a Christian could she be? I mean, please. The woman wears Dolce & Gabbana. And there she is. Be nice. Hi, honey. Thanks for coming. Happy birthday. Thanks. Do I look like a freak? Never mind. Jasper! Razor. Dude! Emily? Razor! What are you doing here? Um, same as you. Just kickin' it, you know. Jasper. This is Emily. This is my friend Jasper. Oh, so this is your Pizza Shack girl? Ah... Not so much friend as bandmate. - Bandmate? - Were you... ...Expecting the Jonas Brothers? Come on, who named the band?. Brian or Mick? I have no idea. Those guys are like skeletons. I would like to introduce you to somebody... - c'mon. Who named the band? - I have no clue. Well then, cough it up. All right. Fine. Thank you. Are you cold or something? She thinks she looks like a freak. You look great. Yeah, really great. Exceptionally great. Ok... Now I really do feel like a freak. Don't listen to him. He really is a freak. I'm not the one who couldn't answer A simple trivia question. Damon, this is Emily Kmetko. That makes sense. What? Nothing. Come on. This is where we Leave Razor to work his awkward But ever so charming magic on Emily. Emily, nice meeting you. Cheers, boys. Hey, wait. 1962. Brian Jones named the band After the Muddy Waters song, "Rolling Stone". Ironic cause he named the band And taught Mick how to play harmonica, But they had to kick him out cause He was such an arrogant ass. We have one of those too. I believe this belongs to you. Wait. Wait. Wait. How could you possibly know that? My mom has a thing for musicians. Who have things for rock 'n roll trivia, And they share a generosity. Well... Like mother like daughter, hopefully, right? Just as friends. So, are you here with somebody? Where is he? No. I'm here with some giris. Oh. Nice. Look, I know this sounds kind of weird, but... They don't know I work at the shack, so... Yeah, I got you. You don't want them to know you work In a place that smells like pepperoni No! That's not it. Not at all. You don't want them catching you Slummin' with some guy Who smells like pepperoni, huh? - Not at all. - No, no... It's all good. I'm cool. Don't worry about it, Emily. I'll catch you later. Wait!

Thank you, daddy. Dad buys me a new charm for my birthday Every year. - Isn't that great? - It is. You know, it's actually appropriate that Summer is here. The whole charm bracelet idea was hers In the first place. Talk about great taste. She picked out all those charms. I'll be right back. I only helped him pick them out really. He just needed a little feminine guidance. You know how men are. So, let me get this straight. For the past few years, all the special gifts my father Has given me have actually come from you? Well, he paid for them. Money's easy for my dad. He's rich. But I don't have to tell you that. I am not interested in your father's money. Please. You can wear That platinum goody-girl cross around you neck, But you're not fooling me. You have ambition written all over you. You know what? Sorry, If I'm like the third wheel than the birthday girl. I'm taking dad's car. - I'm sure you'll get him home. - Lauren! Hey, you want to get lucky? Give this to your girlfriend. Where's Lauren?

And this first song Is for all the giris who like to keep you guessing. Your secrets are safe with me. That's right, Kmetko. He's talking to you. You know the band? Are they any good? I hope so. One, two, three, four! *There's sure to be two people... You and me *But I'm too inclined to think so *There comes a time *When every man needs to step up and fight *At least it says that on my tattoo *It's a... *So get out while you can...

I came with Payson and Emily. And I just... I needed to have some fun for a change! Oh, I didn't know that being with me was such a drag. Carter, please. I'm just tired of all this pressure! I'm tired too. I'm tired of our whole relationship on your terms. On my terms? My whole life is on your terms, or my father's terms, Or that stupid coach's terms. Maybe I just needed my space for once! You want space? Take all you need. In fact, maybe we should just cool it for a while? - Fine. - Fine. - Her boyfriend? - No. It's, uh, her friend's brother I think. Really? In his sixty thousand dollar car?

Don't lecture me. You're training for the olympics! So how many beers did she have? I don't know. However many it takes for a 90 pound girl to get drunk. So, one? - Definitely, at least two. - Maybe even three. Oh man, she is gonna hurt so bad in the morning. I'm glad you called me. You did the right thing. It was Payson's idea. It was a good one. We'll drop you off first, Payson. Hey Maggie, we'll see ya! What are you doing here? I could ask you the same. Do you mind if I sit down? So, you look like you just lost your best friend. I guess you could say that. Yeah, I know the feeling. Kaylie and I used to be best friends. Who's fault is that? Mine. I guess. But Kaylie wasn't there for me, When the new girl showed up. She was just all about herself. Sounds like Kaylie. You know rich giris. Aren't you rich? Yeah, but I¡¦m not spoiled. Ok. Maybe a little bit. Ok. But, I don't blow off the people I love When something better comes on. - It's always about her. - That's Kaylie. She's always got to have everybody chasing after her. Screw her. Why are we even talking about her? Why are we even talking at all? So, that guy glaring at me when I Drove you away from the party, Is he your boyfriend? We're not allowed to have boyfriends. You're not allowed to go to keggers either. But, you don't strike me As a girl who's afraid to break the rules. Well, sometimes you have to break the rules, To survive. What? You're not like most giris your age. It that a good thing or a bad thing? Neither. It's just... You're interesting. I'm walking you to the door this time. No argument. What about her? Trust me.
