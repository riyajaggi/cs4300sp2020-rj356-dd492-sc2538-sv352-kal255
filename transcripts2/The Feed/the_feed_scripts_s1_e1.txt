 Invent a more beautiful world. Share your world. Share your life. Your memories, mundles, are safe forever. ♪ ♪ MARK: Just to give you a sense of the huge international interest, look at the crowds gathering online...

 to around the world, today's wedding was watched by all. EVERETT: We hear there's been some anti-Feed rhetoric? RALPH: Yeah, but the family doesn't seem concerned. MARK: The crowd, the culture, the imagery. It was an Anglican Church of England service worthy of Royals. CONNIE: The most powerful family in Japan has now joined the most powerful family in the world. DON: Security is tight. They have multi-block closures... (REPORTER SPEAKING SPANISH) BRITISH REPORTER: The excitement is electric here at The British Museum. (REPORTER SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) MARK: The museum looks stunning. (REPORTER SPEAKING ARABIC) LUCY: Guests are arriving for the reception right now. (REPORTER SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) AMY: They're in for a treat. Feed inventor Lawrence Hatfield and his programmers coded the whole event. RALPH: And images are forthcoming... MARK: And as the quickcodes alight... (REPORTER SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) LUCY: Can you see this? Guests' Feeds are just brimming with Japanese imagery. (REPORTER SPEAKING JAPANESE) LILY: Japan has come to The British Museum. Cool. ♪ ♪ (GUESTS CHATTERING) (LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE) - CHEF: Good to go. - WOMAN: Thank you, Chef. Okay, I'll take that. CHEF: You're late. Start prepping the chicken. Chop, chop. FEED VOICE: Chicken legs, skin removed, shallots peeled. (VOICE GLITCHING): Garlic cloves. (GLITCHING CONTINUES) (GLASS CLINKING) Touma here once told me that marriage is like three years sitting on a rock. (LAUGHTER) (CHUCKLES) I can see by the looks on some of your faces you're as baffled as I was, but... think of it, what happens in those years while the rock gets warm, and even if we go through... ♪ I'm a twisted man ♪ ♪ Tearing through your perfect world... ♪ LAWRENCE: some things change, things get better, provided you've found the right rock. Now I've always said the key to building a good future is to attract good people, and when Ben first brought Miyu home, we... well, we were delighted. He has clearly learned from example. And I have no doubt that together they will build - a very good future. - Indeed. We are delighted that Ben has found such a complimentary partner in Miyu. ♪ It's just the side of you tonight ♪ ♪ That makes me... ♪ MEREDITH: How she has managed to balance all of this and a full workload in medical school is beyond me. It is testament to her perseverance and her intellect. Now she will graduate with honors and a new husband. ♪ You make me stay out all night ♪ ♪ It's just the side of you tonight ♪ ♪ That makes me stay out all night ♪ ♪ I'm gonna stay out all night ♪ ♪ I would never treat you bad ♪ ♪ You deserve the best from me ♪ ♪ If you want to keep your place ♪ ♪ You'd better get down on your knees. ♪ (LAUGHS) I could teach you some moves if you want. What're you dancing to? If you go on, I'll play it for you. Go off and sing it to me. Like now? - Yeah. (CHUCKLES) - Okay. GUESTS: Cheers! LAWRENCE: To Ben and Miyu. ♪ I will never treat you bad, you deserve ♪ ♪ The best from me and nah, nah, nah... ♪ No, no, no, you just made that up. - You calling me a liar? - No. Not yet. We're just starting out. You American? (CHUCKLES) Sorry. (INDISTINCT YELLING IN DISTANCE) - (ELECTRICITY BUZZING) - (GROANING) - (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING) - Oh... Stop, stop, stop, stop. - How do you know Ben? - I don't really. Evelyn and Ben were at college... Uni, whatever you guys say. Uni. Evie, Max, this is... - Tom. - Tom. Tom, yeah, that's my name, yeah. Evelyn works with Lawrence Hatfield on the Feed. She's a programmer. She loves her job. I do, seriously. I don't. Max. Offliner by trade. Barely. He runs digital detoxes as an excuse to go camping. My bosses are holding court, so excuse me, but it's lovely to meet you. You, too. Gonna get myself another drink. Nice meeting you, man. You, too. - And you are? - Oh, I'm Kate. You're not worried you're gonna piss off the Hatfields? What are they gonna do? Take away my Feed? It's more interesting this way. (SCREAMING) (GASPING) Move. Move! Move. Move. Move. You're okay. You're fine. - Tom. Don't. Tom. - TOM: You're fine. You're okay. WOMAN: Please, stop. TOM: Why are you doing this? I can help you. M-My head. P-Please. What's wrong with your head? I-I can't turn him off. Him? Do you hear someone? Voices? WOMAN: Oh, stop. Stop, stop, stop. It's so dark. Don't want to do it. I don't want to do it. I don't... I don't want to do this. (SCREAMING) You all right? (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Name's Sara Hoyt. We checked her out three times. The Japanese checked her out. Well, how did she get in the building? - She had the appropriate... - Where are you taking her? Hospital. - Then police. - Wait, no. - I-I can talk to her. - Tom, we can handle it. If you want to do something useful, change your shoes. Are we all right? He's fine. Yeah. Who said women belong in the kitchen? (ALL LAUGH) Earth's the insane asylum for the universe, am I right? - (ALL LAUGH) - I'm fine. Really. Drink up. ♪ ♪ Thanks. - KATE: Hey. - Hi. This wedding is way more exciting - than I thought it would be. - (CHUCKLES): Yeah. Think she'll be okay? What? You think she'll be okay? I hope so. Well, nice work. I just talked. You grabbed. - Yeah. - (CHUCKLES): I mean, you... - you actually grabbed. - (EXHALES) You a little, uh...? What? Little crazy? (CHUCKLES): Crazy? Maybe. Kind of made me want to do something else a little crazy. Got to love the posh. Even a maiming can't stop a good pour. (CHUCKLES) EVELYN: Do you think I should tell Kate he's a Hatfield? (SCOFFS) Who? Sneakers? He's Ben's older brother. (CHUCKLES) Hmm. Let's go slow. - Who is she? - Nobody, really. Sara Hoyt. Been with the catering crew for years. Cleared every security check. - Could she be a Resister? - Maybe. But they're not usually violent. Resisters hate the Feed, but they've never tried to murder anyone. An attack on Ben, that's-that's a step up. It's an attack on my family. She seems pretty disturbed. - Get her out of here. - Okay. I'll make the arrangements. We don't need to bother the police. And remind the guests. They signed a confidentiality agreement. - If one word of this leaks... - It won't. I've got the entire wedding on lock. Complete control. Every picture, every mundle. If Sara's in anything, I'll delete it. (SIGHS) (FEED WHIRS) Access. FEED VOICE: Access denied. I had the strangest dream. Like I was floating above myself. TOM: Maybe... (GRUNTS) Maybe it's because your subconscious is split because you're literally two people. Yeah. And I have two bladders now, - so I have to pee double. - (CHUCKLES) - Good morning. - (CHUCKLES) Do you think her little feet run when mine do? Not if she's got my flat feet. (EXHALES) BEN: Third message I've left. I need to talk to you. It's urgent. - Fuck off. - (TOILET FLUSHES) Ben. Persistent man. You think you're any different? Oh, shit. I forgot I got lunch with your mom today. (AMERICAN ACCENT): Shit. - (BRITISH ACCENT): Just trying it out. Yeah. - Yeah? It feels good. Can't believe you asked her, though. We just landed at the perfect distance. Them over there. Far over there. Because you're still a Hatfield. I'll change my name. Well, they're gonna do the birth announcement regardless. At least I can make it on our terms. Plus, I'd kind of like a maternal presence around when I eject this. I'm not sure you could classify my mum as maternal, but I get it. I do, I do. I-I get it. It's just... However, if she uses the word "intimacy" even once, I swear... (LAUGHS): You are cute when you're so British. Stereotype. Shit. Just be aware of the agenda behind the agenda. - I know her. - Do I look like a pushover? Because you're the one sleeping on lavender pillows. Ah. The things I do for sex. - You know, you should be thanking me. Mm. - Oh, yeah? - Why's that? - Well, I'm hanging out with your mother so you don't have to. (WHISPERS): Oh, wow. - You're amazing. - Mm. - You're brilliant. - (CHUCKLES): Uh-huh. I love you. - Hey, hey, you have a nice night. - Where is he? Thank you for the drink, Pa. (UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) God, how can you stand it? It's too still without it. Off, Danny. Huh? It's not fair you can stay on whenever you want and I can't. Well, I understand the fundamentals of self-regulation. You, you're on Feed-acid. You're addicted. - Why do you think you need it so much? - Simple. My dad don't show me no love at home, so I get it from strangers. That is surprisingly astute. - Eh. - And thoroughly messed up. You need to function... Hey, Danny. - (FINGERS SNAP) - Danny. You got hit by a car fucking about, spraying live. The car got it worse. You need to think for yourself. Stop relying on the Feed. You need to control it. - Don't let it control you. - When you gonna teach me - to shred already? I mean, that's real. - Well, maybe when you can focus for more than two seconds and won't skate into a bus. Yeah, shredder. That's me. Off, Danny. - Oh... - Off. - Completely off, okay? - All right. All right. (MUSIC STOPS) (STUTTERING) Danny. Danny? Danny, go on. (PANTING) It happened again, yeah? (CHUCKLES) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Ben. What are you...? Y-Yeah, okay. Come in. (DOOR CLOSES) What are you doing here? Well, you wouldn't return my calls, so... - Just... can you... - We need your help. Me? With what? Ben, just please. It's confidential, all right? Between me and the patient? And if it's legal, yes. - Are you the patient? - (SCOFFS) Please. Got enough fucking therapy in marriage counseling. I liked Miyu. I was sad that you split. Ah, well, that makes one of us. Just go on. Dad needs to talk to you. Uh, no. I'm not on your payroll, Ben. - I have patients. - Where? They're... staggered. Just go on. You'll get me out of your office. We could have just led with that when you came in. Ah, good morning, Tom. Hi. What? What's going on? My friend is in trouble. Okay. What can I possibly do that you can't? Engage. It involves his child. This is Dmitri Garin. He runs our Moscow hub. He's quite brilliant, but he's been missing since yesterday, and his wife seems to think their son has something to do with it. So, access their mundles and... find out. Yes, yes, of course. We tried, but Dmitri is off, and his son has been blocked since last Tuesday. I don't know how. Blocked? You can't block the Feed. Exactly. That's why I need your expertise, but this needs to stay between us. Well? Don't take your aversion to me out on this boy. You're a Feed psychologist. You can help him... Talk to him, get him to open up. He could be in a great deal of trouble. He's only 15, Tom. For the boy. Right. Thank you. (LIVELY CHATTER) Sorry. Bloody meetings. Mwah. You look wonderful. Is-is she very big? - She's average. - And you, darling. - How are you? - Good. Some headaches, but good. Well, do you need anything? Crib? Nanny? Some money? (GASPS) Let me get you a night nurse, Kate. I can't tell you how much it helps. No. No money, no nurse. We're fine. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to win you over. I know you're not thrilled with us right now. I just... wish we didn't have to do an announcement. But if we don't disclose her birth, people will think we're trying to hide something. Being a Hatfield puts you in the public eye. The press will hound you. Okay, but we're gonna do it simply, like our wedding release. Thank you. Believe it or not, we are trying to do this right. I know that. Tom and I aren't as close as I'd like, but... I want to be here for you both. Can I show you something? Last time you were this excited, you showed me the prenup. Oh. Honestly, it's better. (CHUCKLES) Go on. FEED VOICE: From conception to birth, sense your baby's every need. You will create the ultimate bond be... No. Tom's didn't take well. You know we want to hold off. I know Tom does, but do you? Well, I hope I can take care of my child without something telling me how. It does much more than that, Kate. You'll have instant access to each other's every need. It will bond you in... the closest form of intimacy. Tom said you'd use that word. He knows me better than I thought. Yeah. He also said you'd have an agenda. I truly just want what's best for you. (TRILLING) So, are-are... are you seeing anyone yet? Yeah. Nice. Have been for some time. - That's great. - Her name's "work." We're in love. She's always there for me. Where are we going? You're going to Moscow. (BEEPING) Anna. (CRIES) Oh, my dear. Now, it's fine. Don't worry. Listen, if anyone can get Anton to talk, it's Tom. He has a great affinity with children. - He's about to have one of his own, aren't you? - (ANNA SNIFFLES) Tom, this is Anna, Dmitri's wife. Hello. - Hi. - Thank you. Thank you. Please. Wait. Y-You're not coming in? I don't want the boy to feel like it's an inquisition. I'll see what I can find in Dmitri's office. If Anton says anything, if you locate Dmitri, message me. Anna, if you need anything... Anton? - (TRILLING) - BEN: Anything? EVELYN: Anton's mundles have been transferred here, - but we still don't have access. - Well, if Tom can get the kid to turn on his Feed, will we have access then? I don't know. We've never been blocked from someone's Feed before. Couldn't we just... scoop it out? Why don't you try? Tom's already there. Then we'll just have to wait. I can't get in. Aah! (TRILLING) Anton. Hey, man. I'm... Tom. I'm a psychologist. You can talk to me. Mm, we can stay offline. We can take it slow. You can trust me. I'm... f-f-fine. Go. Your mum... She's-she's worried about you. You hurt yourself. You-you gouged out your eye? Can you tell me why? I don't... remember. Don't... don't want to. You're not alone, Anton. There's a name for what you're going through... "dissociative amnesia." It's where a memory is unconsciously blocked due to its association with a trauma. Like your father going missing. Do you want us to find him? Okay. Then you need to talk to me. I can help you remember. Yeah, memories and thoughts... They're-they're... kind of like machines? You know, wired there somewhere in the mind. And the only way you'll be able to fix a broken machine is to explore the problem. And we can start small. Like... do you remember what you did last Friday? Yeah? School. Good. Good. What about Saturday? Friends. Party. Do you remember what you did yesterday morning? Roofing. How... how do...? I-I don't know how to say. Can you show me? Just that. Nothing else. (PANTING) (GRUNTS SOFTLY) (PANTING) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) FEED VOICE: Ben Hatfield is requesting to join this mundle. (GRUNTS) (PANTING) Do you do this a lot? For hits. More hits, more money. Do you really need the money? Does anyone? Does your father know? Can you tell me what happened next? I... I don't know. I don't want to. Anton, you're doing really well. You're clearly very brave. I need you to stay brave, for yourself. For your father. (ANTON SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Well, then I'm off. I don't want to see them. ANTON: Come on, it was only 45 floors. Only? Anton, you are my son. If anything happened to you, two floors is too much. (HORSE SNORTS) (BREATH TREMBLING) (GASPS) ANTON: Why?! Why did you make me see that? I don't want to see that! Why? Why?! Why?! (KATE GRUNTS SOFTLY) (SIGHS) God, these... (INHALES, EXHALES FORCEFULLY) (WATER RUNNING) You okay in there? (EXHALES) Ugh, it feels like something's pounding through my head. (INHALES, EXHALES FORCEFULLY) (SCREAMS, SOBS) (SOBBING CONTINUES) (CRYING): No, please. Please. Please turn it off. It's so dark. Please. Erase it... the mundles. Everything. I don't want to see it, please. Turn it off. Erase my Feed. Erase my Feed. (CRYING): Please. Dmitri Garin, head of the Moscow hub, and the Feed's largest insider shareholder, has been murdered. His son, Anton, has been arrested for the crime. Anton Garin claims to have no memory of the killing of his father but his mundles prove otherwise. Authorities are not disclosing a motive yet, but sources close to the investigation are speculating the risk-taking teen may have been motivated by his inheritance. Others suggest he may have suffered a mental break, brought on by Dmitri Garin's harsh disapproval of his son's activity. Did you get any sleep? Uh... No. I... I keep seeing Dmitri's dead face - every time I close my eyes. - Delete it. The mundle, delete it. It wasn't on. It's not even saved. I just... (EXHALES) I don't get it, you know. Anton loved his father. I saw it. I felt it. It just... It doesn't... I don't get it. If you'd heard him fucking scream, Kate. He was just as shocked as we were. Um, do you think he had a psychotic break? Well, something broke. He-he thought something was in his head. He said that? "Something was in my head"? What was it? I... I don't know. - Can you talk to him again? - No. H-His mother had him committed to avoid prison, and we can't look inside his Feed 'cause it's blocked. But you have that kind of clearance? You can look inside someone's entire Feed? (SIGHS) They can. I can't. Why? You need a good shrink? (CHUCKLES) No. 'Cause I know a guy. - I do. - Hmm? - Yeah, I think you'd like him. - Right. Yeah, he's pretty good. - I'll get you a good deal. - No. No. You do not want to be inside my head. (SIGHS) See you later, honey. Okay, look. (CHUCKLES) We both know you've got my birthday marked out in your little head machine, all right? So, come on. Honey, I'm so sorry. Nice try. Come on. Out with it. What have we got? Presents? Attention? Adoration? Birthday song, maybe? (LAUGHS) I am not nearly drunk enough to sing. Maybe after dinner. Ah. So there's a dinner. With Tom and Kate, yes. Fun. Okay, I'm listening. - What else? - But, honey, you are impossible to buy for. I don't know the off-Feed shops like you do. Maybe you should go off more. I'd get fired. Maybe you should go on more. Eh, what? Happy birthday. What...? What does it do? It can turn me into whatever you want, really. Although, if you say Marilyn Monroe, I will leave you. (LAUGHS) But I like you like you, though. I know. It's just an enhancement. Something to play with. Okay. - Why don't you, uh, show me? - Tonight. - I have to go to work. - Mm. Mm. - ♪ Happy birthday to you. ♪ - (CHUCKLES) - (CHUCKLES) - Love you. Something's just... off. Kate, you're fine. No, I know, but I'm also not. That's not much to work with. I can't put my finger on it. Look, I'm not seeing any flags. Your blood pressure's fine. No, I know. I know all of that. I just... I-I keep getting these headaches. That's a common side effect of pregnancy. Is it wrong that I don't feel connected to the baby? I don't feel anything, really. I mean, I know she's there. I got the gut to prove it. I just... I don't, like, love her yet. Is that awful? Am I thinking too much? That's perfectly normal. But shouldn't I have... instincts? You will. It takes time. You have to get to know her. So I'm fine? Then... why don't I feel fine? (MAX AND EVELYN BREATHING HEAVILY) (EXHALES, LAUGHS) - Well? - Babe, it's your breasts on crack. (LAUGHS) - Even if I can't feel them properly, I can see them, and I... I couldn't be happier. Good. So do you want to go again, or...? - Come on, we are late. - Oh, man. (GROANS) (QUIET CHATTER) Thank you. Wow. - Will you help me? - Yeah, of course. There you go. Is that enough? - Yeah. All right. No. - A little more? - Sure? - Yeah, I'm not that big. - WAITER: There we go, ma'am. - (TOM GRUNTS, CHUCKLES) -Careful. - And, sir, that's for you. - Ah, thanks. - I've ordered some wine. - Nice. - Now you're taunting me. - I will drink for both of us. Don't worry about that. - Yeah. Good. Thank you. - Ev. Did my dad tell you about Moscow? Maybe. Why? Just, uh, you know, Anton and the woman at Ben's wedding, the troubled one, they said it was dark, like something was in there and they-they couldn't turn it off. They did? They didn't tell you? MAX: Well, maybe he didn't notice. I mean, Ben's wedding was more than two years ago. I still remember. Did he? I'm not playing this game with you, where you just ply me for information I can't legally divulge. - So... - All right. Okay. Your tune will change - when you're a bottle deep. - (EVELYN LAUGHS) - More? - When. When. When. When. - Thank you. - (ALL LAUGHING) Hi, love. I missed you today. I've missed you all week. I don't like going for so long without you. Then come home. It's too quiet there. What happened in Russia? Apparently, it was a bloody mess. You need a vacation. - Yeah? What's that? - (LAUGHS) One day, we'll go somewhere together. Somewhere with drinks inside coconuts. - Mm. Maybe. - (CHUCKLES) One day. Come on, come on, come on, come on. It's a piece of wood. - And... - (EVELYN LAUGHS) - A wood whittler? - Yes. Yeah. Do you need a garden gnome or something? - What is this? - We thought you'd like it. Well, you've been keeping up with him too long, haven't you? Hey, y-you're always talking about making stuff with your hands. Yeah, mate, a bar or a workbench, - (LAUGHING): not fucking salad tongs. - (LAUGHS) Do I look an old white guy? Matter of fact, here you go. For your future, sir. Well, thank you very much. I will carve myself a pipe to match my monocle. (ALL LAUGHING) Seriously, though, do you guys even know me, like, at all? Evie, show them your present. - Go on. - What, here? - Yes, babe. - All right. KATE: What? - Wait. Is that a joke? No way. - Wow. MAX: Great gift for a guy - who doesn't like to be on, eh? - You love it. She's right. I do. I do love it. - I'm not gonna lie, I do love it. - Max. Max. You're supposed to be our leader, man. Resister comrade in arms. Yeah, but it's like fucking a whole new person. Babe, no offense. - She can be anyone. - KATE: Hmm. - Babe, show them. - Thank you, but no thank you. It's just for us. You want to fuck a new person, too? No. Never. Only you. - Hmm. Smart man. - Mm-hmm. - It's just... it's too odd. - Right. I mean, really? Is it... Does it even feel right? - Right enough. Yeah. - (LAUGHS) Of all people. Look, I was gonna deactivate but she is a temptress. - I'm only mortal. - Everyone gives in eventually. You are addicted. - So are you. - (DIGITAL WARBLING) (FEEDS OVERLAPPING INDISTINCTLY) - Did your Feeds just go on? - (GLASS BREAKING) (FEEDS CONTINUE INDISTINCTLY) I can't turn it off. All my stuff is running and-and I can't stop it. MAX: Yeah, mine, too. Evie, can you turn yours off? EVELYN: I'm trying, but I can't get control. It's locked me out of every application. TOM: Yeah, same. Kate, how's the baby? KATE: I don't know. Everything is open. MAN: Please. WOMAN: Tony, please, your heart. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) KATE: All my stuff is running and I can't stop it. MAX: What is this? EVELYN: I don't know, but I can't get control of it. - (SCREAMING) - (CRYING) (SHOUTING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (SCREAMING) (SQUEALING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (RAPID GUNFIRE) (SHOUTING, BABY CRYING) (SCREAMING) - (SHRIEKING) - (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) ♪ ♪ NEWSWOMAN: People all over the world lost control (NEWS BROADCASTS OVERLAPPING) -of their Feeds this evening as the whole system was hacked. And reports are already pouring in of panicked, chaotic incidents occurring in multiple cities worldwide. Car accidents and power outages, some in hospitals, have anxiety at an all-time high. But resisters to the Feed are enthused, using the malfunction to further their agenda. Sue Cole, chief of the International Crime and Security Agency, is currently on her way to an emergency meeting to discuss the matter. She has agreed to answer some brief questions. Hello, Miss Cole. Can you tell us anything about the hack? We will not be divulging details until we know more. And calling on Lawrence Hatfield for questioning. What's going on? First there's a thing at Ben's wedding, then Anton breaks down, now you're being hacked... I just... We've just seen a man's pacemaker stop. He nearly died. What the fuck is going on? What happened at the wedding was unfortunate. Preview of the whole damn marriage. Thank you. But it was two years ago. It has nothing to do with the disturbed child or what happened tonight. Every system is susceptible to viruses. One got in. We got it out. - Security is incr... - But how did a virus get in? It's supposed to be impenetrable. Yes, well, we have our best people working on that. I'm working on that. Yeah. You have an answer for everything. You have a question for everything. - Was I talking to you? - Stop it. I'm not one of your board members. We're about to have a baby. Can you just, please... tell me we're safe. Yes, of course. Everything's under control. We're also thinking of our granddaughter, obviously. No, no, no, no, don't do that. Don't use her to manipulate me. - What about the video? - BEN: It's pretty straightforward. We're sheep; we follow a false god. People are mental. It doesn't mean anything. Then why spray it? Publicity. Chaos. It's a typical Resister calling card. So you know it's the Resisters? Who else would it be? Too many questions. This isn't the first crisis we've dealt with. I know this system better than anyone in the entire world, and even I've never seen anything like this. Then do what you do best. Learn from it, then outsmart it. GIL: Evelyn's about to be interviewed. We should stop this. MAX (ON FEED): Wow. Huh. Great gift for a guy who doesn't like to be on, eh? EVELYN: Oh, shut up. You love it. She's right, I do. I do love it, I'm not gonna lie. - KATE: You want to fuck a new person, too? - TOM: Nope, never. Only you. I don't need to see any more. Mm-hmm. SUE: So, how many is that? GIL: We've looked at the mundles of Ana, Mike, Natalie, Tate, Evelyn. They're all clear. Five employees out of 5,000? LAWRENCE: Well, they're setting the algorithms that will find this virus, so no one touches a code until they're cleared. BEN: Same goes for Tokyo, Mumbai, Harare, everywhere, until we figure out what happened. LAWRENCE: If you'd like to hurry things along, then you're welcome to go down to the server pools with the rest of your agents and clear more mundles, I'll walk you out. Scan former employees, too. The only way someone hacked in is because they were already here. So find them. That's not what he told Tom. No. He told Tom what he needed to hear. (PANTS SOFTLY) Tom? - Tom. - Hmm? Something was there. What? Something was in my head. Wha-What are you talking about? - You're right, something's wrong in the Feed. - Wha-what? - What do you mean? - Something was in there with me. Hey, hey, maybe... - maybe it was just a... - No, I know what I felt. All right, okay, okay, okay. You have to look. - In my head, you have to look, okay? - Okay. I'd be in-in your Feed. - (SIGHS) - Not just in your mundles. I'd-I'd see everything, your private channels, your thoughts, I'd see everything. I don't care. I need to know. Okay. TOM: Okay, I have to talk to my dad, but... okay. My waters broke. First and foremost, I would like to assure you that everything is under control. As CEO of the Feed, I take this momentary interruption very seriously. We believe the Resisters are responsible for the leaked propaganda video, but rest assured, the breach was immediately shut down, and it will never happen again. Your safety and well-being are of the upmost importance to us. And in appreciation for your continued support, we are giving everyone a free six-month upgrade to our new backup app, SAVEYOU. You will no longer need to buy storage to keep your chosen mundles. All moments while you are on, no matter how small, will be uploaded and automatically stored for free. Thank you and keep safe. We'll spray it within the hour. What if the Resisters deny responsibility for the hack? They'd be stupid to. This gives their cause a PR boost. People need someone to blame so they can move on. Soon they'll forget it even happened. MEREDITH: But we won't. I've got to go. Fine. So... what now? Well, we start at the start. That hasn't got us anywhere. You know, Einstein once said trying the same thing - over again... - Fuck Einstein! You fail. You try again. You fail. You try again. You fail. You try again! (BREATHING DEEPLY) Oh, God! Oh, God, I can't. No, I can't. Yes, you can, love. Just breathe. Something's wrong. I need to be on. No, no, no. You can do this, love. (GRUNT) You don't know what this feels like! - Can we please just get the epidural? - KATE: No. - Please. Please. - No, no, no, no. I need to be on for that. Love, you don't need... - Tom, please? Please? - I can't. You said something was in your head, Kate. The two people who have said that tried to kill someone. - One did. - This wasn't my birth plan. - DOCTOR: Mr. Hatfield, your mother's here. - My... - What are you doing here? - I came for Kate. - How did you even know? - She needs relief, Tom. - Did you call her? - KATE: No, no, no. Shut up, shut up, shut up. There's another one! There's another one! She needs the epidural. She's not going on! Can she do it off? - I'm sorry. - KATE: Oh, please, please? All right, love, all right, love. - Tom, listen to her. - Stay out of this. You weren't invited. - You're being selfish. - Get out! No, no, no, no. Stay. Stay, please. Tom, she's right, she's right. I need to be on. I need to be on. - Doctor, go on. - Okay. - Kate. - Yeah? Look at me. Concentrate on your breathing. - Okay. - Relief is coming. - Doctor, is she on? - Okay. Relief is coming, Kate. Just breathe. - Okay. - Breathe. - Yeah. - Good girl. KATE: Yeah. Ah... (WHISPERING): You're doing great, Kate. Breathe. (MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY) (FAINT CONVERSATION IN DISTANCE) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY) What was that? - Sorry? - Just... now, you-you handed something to my mother just now. - What was it? - Oh, it was the cord blood banking. - She'd like to pay, so I gave her the contact. - At what point... - Doctor? - (EXHALES): Oh. Now, she got a perfect Apgar score. (CRYING) - Never had any doubt, Bea. - KATE: Tom... DOCTOR: Well, take it easy, get some rest, and call me if you have any concerns. Okay? I'm so sorry. I-I was such a prick. - No, about your mom. - No, no, no, no. You were right. I get it. You needed her. But we don't have to think about that now. Now... now we just get to be happy. (SOFTLY): Okay. - (BEA FUSSING) - Oh. Hello, you. Oh... Come on, Bea. - Shh, shh, shh. - (CRYING) - TOM: Oh... - (CRYING QUIETS) KATE: She's here. Beatrice Murray. Seven pounds one ounce of Hatfield progeny. I'm back to having only one bladder. (CHUCKLES): I feel better already. Max. Max! (CHUCKLES): Oh, sorry, babe. I'm just reading about the Shelby Cobra. - I miss my dad's driving. - Kate had the baby. - Yeah? - Beatrice Marie. Sweet! Ah. Congratulations. Do you want to make a baby? Oh, it is my biological imperative. (PATS BED) Come on. Well, you seem to know what you're doing. (EXHALES) Hardly. But she's cute. - (LAUGHS) It helps. - (FUSSES) Oh. Hey, come here. How's your head? Fine. Why? Um, because you were so worried. About what? About something being in there. No, I wasn't. Kate, you said something was in your head. - Why would I even say that? - (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) You were panicking. You woke up panicked about it. I was panicked because my water broke. - Shh, shh, shh. - Those are some good drugs they've got you on. I think I remember my own memory. Check it. Check-check your memory. Check your mundles. Check yours. I wasn't on. (SIGHS) No. I have no idea what you're talking about. That's absurd. What did you just see? I startled awake when my water broke. No, no, Kate, you called out, you woke me. - Yeah, 'cause I was in labor. - No, because something was in your head. - No. - (CRYING) Oh. How could that even happen? I mean... I was worried because something was coming out of me. Not because something was going in. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Can I, can I hold her? Shh, shh. (KISSES) - (WHISPERS): Hey. Oh. - (FUSSES) Can I hold the baby, Kate? (FUSSING) Kate? No change? We've exhausted every avenue... Surgery, electroshock therapy, medication. Access to her Feed is irrevocably blocked, or damaged by the wound to her eye. Maybe it's time we remove it. It's embedded... retrieving it would literally kill her. MEREDITH: First and foremost, I would like to assure you that everything is under control. Your safety and well-being are of the utmost importance to us.
