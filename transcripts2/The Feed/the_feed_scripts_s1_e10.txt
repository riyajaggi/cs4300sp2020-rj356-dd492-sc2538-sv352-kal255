 Share your life. Your memories, mundles, are safe forever. Ben! No! Okay... We're experiencing high call volumes. What is your emergency? Police. Hey. All right, okay, do you, do you need a hospital? - No. - Hey, no, look, do you need a hospital? I'll be okay. It's not a deep cut. - We need to find Bea. - Hey, but listen. Bea, she's with Ben. She's okay.

 What's he doing with Martha? I don't know what he's doing with her, but it's Ben. He won't hurt Bea. He won't. - Okay? All right? Okay, okay. - Okay. Okay. Stay with me. I'm here. Keep going. Come on. Okay. We stay together now, okay? Meredith. My sister and I have been conferring about what I should do with you. She thinks I should let Hau decide. But that might not end well. He has his reservations. I mean, given the choices, what would you do? Work together. A leader has to make hard decisions. Can't please everybody. Somebody somewhere is always gonna be unhappy. I mean, like, now. Do I please Sen... or trust you? I'm gonna let Hau decide. I won't let you hurt her. Will it be painful? Does Tom have scars? Yes. Small price to pay for what he got in return. How much of Tom... is Tom? All of him. Lawrence just enhanced what was already there. And why would he do that? Curiosity. Science. Fun. We're little Frankensteins. Sewn-up pieces thrown together in the wrong body. SAVEYOU gave him the chance to store more than just mundles. He could store their entire Feed, their consciousness. Play with the dead ones, and no one's the wiser. Why didn't he delete it when things started to go wrong? He forgot about us. He's got thousands of experiments in there. We're just one on a list. And we weren't supposed to get out, but he programmed us to survive and that's what we were doing. Who were you? Before. Michaela Green. I was only 27. I had a little girl. Her name was Ellie. Can't know what it's like to have to say goodbye to your child. Shit. Tom got through. It's okay. We always knew this would be a possibility. - What am I doing? - Ben, it will be okay. Just do what I said. Oh... okay. - Ben Hatfield? - Yes, Officer. That's, that's me. My brother, Tom, he's got the-the thing, the virus, and, uh, he was attacking his wife and-and her sister, and then they were coming for me and the baby so I got Bea and I put her in the car and I-I drove. - I just drove... I... - That's not the story we've got. Well, it's true. Believe me. You have to find my brother and stop him. Are you okay? I just need a hospital. T-That's, that's where I'm taking her, there... that's where I'm going now. I... What happened? I was hit by a car. No... Get back! Oh... Oh... Go. What did you do? What did you do?! What the fuck...? What the fuck? Oh, this is crazy. Oh, what am I doing? What am I doing? What do you think he was recording when he just died? Whose face is gonna be in those mundles? His friends will be coming for justice. No. They'll never be able to link it to me. They're gonna know your brother placed a call accusing you of kidnapping a kid and helping someone that killed a cop. You're Ben Hatfield. You are gonna be ruined. Oh, you already are. We can change that. They're coming through, Ben. You can't stop us. You can't. But we can protect you. We can give you access to Lawrence's files. His instinct, his power. We can give you control. You can be the son that Tom never was. But, right now, we're your only hope. So drive. Beatrice Hatfield, approaching St George's Road. Hey, there's a hospital seven miles off. No, no, no, no, keep going. Ben's still driving. The police should stop them before then. I should have known about Martha. No, no, Kate, you did everything right. You saved Bea. It's just Ben. He won't do anything. He doesn't have the stomach. She does. She wants you. Needs you for some reason. Why? Fuck. We need to recharge. It's all right. It's all right... Sen? What's going on? - What are you doing? - I won't let you control the Feed to suppress our people even more. Suppress our people? Do you think you have the first idea about running this country? Anyone is better than you. Let's get started. What happened? Evelyn. We had no choice. There's a girl in here. She's not one of them. Cass? Cass? Oh... C-Cass? Danny? Danny! Danny? Danny, Danny. Do you remember me? I'm Tom's friend. Evelyn. Is it over? I want to go home. We'll get you there, okay? I promise. She did nothing wrong. Who's this kid? We got a survivor! We need to evaluate him. Make sure he's not manipulating you. Are you out of your fucking mind?! He's not one of them. He tricked his way in here to save his friend, who you have just killed, by the way, and who also isn't one of them. Unless you want me to spray everything that happened here and fucking bury you, get him out of here. How am I gonna tell her dad? You don't have to. They'll take care of it. Get him to medical. And then take him home. There's supposed to be a charge station somewhere around here. Hello? Hello? We need some help! Fuck, fuck... Shit. Okay, I'm gonna go and find some help, okay? You stay here. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right, hey, look at me. I'm gonna find some help. - Yeah. - All right. Hurry. Hurry. Hello? Hello? What are you doing here? Hey, ah, um, well, we need to, uh, just-just ch-charge up. - We're closed. - Yeah. We're in a hurry somewhere. My wife, please, she's-she's hurt. Yeah. I saw you. - What? - What'd you do to her? - Is she dead? - What? No. Are you one of them? The things coming through. - The virus? - No, no, no, no. W-We're trying, trying to get somewhere, that's all. I'm n... I'm not one of them. I swear. I'm n-not... D-Do you, you know some... You know one? - Don't fuck with me. - I'm not fucking with you. I'm just... mate, I just, um, I know you're scared. I'm scared, too. But my wife, she's not dead. You can see for yourself. Check. See, she's right... This will not be a smooth transition. These people aren't used to women in power. I have experience with that. Welcome. The traitor Hau Nguyen has betrayed our president; I am your new leader. Mrs. Hatfield will assume control of network regulation. We can set up in my office. How long will it take? Depending on the coders, seven months to two years. And I want my people. Tom? Tom? I can't seem to kill him. No, you... y-you don't have to. They're dangerous. My son. He... he attacked me. He came at me, and I reacted. I know what you're going through. I know how confused you are, but please, don't hurt us. He broke in. No, no, no... We were desperate. Our baby, - she's in trouble. - How do you know he's really your husband? I know he's not one of them. That's what my son said. No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He didn't do this to me. My sister. She did this. She-she, she was taken. No, no, no. Kate, Kate, stay back, stay back! Please. Please don't hurt her. Please don't hurt her. Please. We're just trying to find our baby. Please. See, his instinct is to protect me. Okay? He would never hurt me. Never, never. Please. Oh, God. Kate, Kate. Oh, God... Please, Kate. Hey, hey, hey, hey... Hey, stay awake. Stay awake. I'm gonna get you to a hospital, okay? Stay with me, stay with me. Mundle. Stephanie Martinello and Darian Charles' wedding day. Do you wish to copy? Yes. Profile uploaded. Do you wish to delete the original profile of Stephanie Martinello? Delete. Profile deleted. I got in for 17 seconds. You gained access? SAVEYOU's got an open port 22. There's a secure shell running. Ah, uh, okay, everyone, new deal. Create a buffer overflow. You can trick SAVEYOU into thinking you're a root user. I only lasted 17 seconds before it caught me, but I managed to delete one profile. That's one taker. Every time you get in, delete as many profiles as you can. Until we find a back door, this is the best that we can do. Where are you going? To find someone who can tell us how the fuck to delete SAVEYOU. Just relax. Tom will be much more inclined to help us if I'm holding her. Tom? Did you really think I was gonna use Bea? She's just the bait. It's Tom we need. Hurry him up. Well, your mum's not answering, but I've left word you're coming home. Your NDA says that you don't tell her what happened here, now, you hear me? Get him out of here. D-Danny! Danny, what the fuck? We've been trying you all night. What happened? Where's his place? A-Around the corner. They deactivated us once we got inside. They deactivated you? You ain't got a Feed? Bloody hell. How you still standing? Practice, I guess. Dan? Where's Cass? Get him inside. Don't talk out here. Um... I guess I'll see you around then. You're joking, right? I'm not going anywhere till I know you're all right. You're gonna have to meet my mum. Hey! Help! We need some help. Hey! Hey! We need someone right now. This is an emergency. - Can you please... - What's happened? It's her ribs. She's got, like, a-a cut, a-a wound. She's losing a lot of blood. We need someone right now. Systolic's 40-50. I've ordered a stretcher. Distended neck veins. Likely hemopericardium. She needs a lateral thoracotomy now. Okay. All right. All right, here we go. It's okay. Come on. Okay. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Hey, you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be fine, Kate. - We need to get her to surgery. - You're fine now, you're gonna be okay. I'm not leaving her. I'm not leaving you, love. No. No, Bea. Get Bea. Get Bea. New voice mail from Benjamin Hatfield. Tom, Martha's dying. I'm worried she might hurt Bea before you get here. Her real name is Michaela Green. She had a daughter, Ellie. Hurry. They blocked our access to SAVEYOU. We managed to delete 63 profiles. Now we're running a wire sniffer down at the network level, but we're getting nowhere. They siphoned off data gradually so our alerts wouldn't pick up any unusual activity. They've used slow decryption. It'll take us months to break. Look, we need you here. Just keep going. I'll be back soon. Evelyn, Evelyn, help. Evelyn. Guess you don't need this. Thank God. I'm freezing. What are you doing? What... How do I delete SAVEYOU? We know that's where you came from. Uh, um... Stephanie Martinello. That's the name of your wife, right? That would make you... Darian Charles. She's here. - You're lying. - How else would I know where you come from? How do I delete it? Mum? Mum. She should be here. It's her day off. Maybe she's still in bed. You sit down. I'll put the kettle on. Hmm. F-Fuck. Sorry. Um... Are you Ms. Morris? Yes. Right, um, I'm Jonah. I'm friends with your son. My son? Wh-Where is he? Danny, he's, uh, he's been... Actually, maybe it's better if he tells you himself. Mum? They... I... Cass... They've killed her. They killed her. What took you so long? Are we expecting more cops? I'm alone. Give me my baby. Get in the chair. That's where he did it. That's where your father fucked you up. What do you want? Don't you want to see what he did? Give me my baby now. - Don't make me hurt her, Tom. - Just do what she says. Shut it. You give me Bea... and I'll give you Ellie. You're even dumber than I thought. Your daughter, I found her. Ellie Green. You want to see her? No. Just... just turn it off. You can't appeal to my maternal instincts, Tom. Your father erased them. You wouldn't hurt a baby. Look at her. She's an innocent. Leverage is leverage. Now get in the chair. If you hurt Bea, I'll have nothing left to lose. I'll spend my entire life making your people suffer. Even if you wanted to, you couldn't. You're too kind, too good. It's hardwired in you. You have no idea who I am. I know more about you than you do. It's too late. You're too weak. Whatever you're planning, it's over. Sit in the chair. You're dying. Be a man for once and make him. No one's coming to help you. Michaela. Give me my daughter. You failed. - Tom... - What the fuck were you thinking? No, no, no, no, no, no, look, that's always been my problem, hasn't it? I never do the right thing. I wasn't thinking. But I wasn't engineered to. What the hell does that mean? It means you've had every advantage that I haven't. - You're obsessed. - No, no, listen, Tom, this-this-this isn't about DNA. She's right. - She's right? - Dad changed you. He enhanced you. You believe a word that she told you, Ben?! - One fucking word! - That's why you have everything. - That's why you have a family. - A family? What, 'cause I'm the only man in the world with a family? It's called being an adult, Ben. You'd better grow up, you prick. You don't think that I've tried? I can't do it on my own, Tom. I need help. Stop with your excuses. You brought us here. You did this. We... Instead of relying on everyone else to save you... Shh. Try and look at saving yourself. Then sit in the chair. If you want me to save myself, I need what you have. Come on. She's dead. - What harm can it do? - Hey! No, no, no, no, no, no. - You don't touch me. Don't... - Come on. Sit in the chair. Sit-sit in the chair. Tom, sit in the chair, sit in the chair. Sit in the chair, Tom. Come on, sit in the chair. COMMAND, RUN: Regedit. Found. Open? Yes. Oh, my God, you found a back door. It's a type of malware that replicates and circulates without human intervention. It infected our system, then used our network to connect to its source pool to update itself... and then downloaded other types of malware to evade detection. You have to find and delete all of the files associated with the SAVEYOU Worm. If it doesn't work the first time, put it in safe mode and try again. I'll be back soon. They're in. Give me my wife. They've just started the deletion process. I have to wait and see if it's successful. Those are people. You are killing human beings. They've already had one life. They don't get to steal another. I need to know one more thing. I've told you everything. How do I get Max back? You can't. No... You c-can't just push someone out. He has to have gone somewhere. He didn't. Look, I wish that you could have him back, but you can't. - Hey, no... - That's impossible. I am, I am telling you the truth. - Mm-mm. - Okay? He is gone. - No. - There is no backup. I have told you everything. Please. Please do not do this. Please. Please, I am begging you. No! No! No! Stop! Please! I'll kill you. I swear, I will. I will kill you, Evelyn. Then they sprayed this, this thing. This noise. I mean, it was so loud. We were screaming. T-The pain in our heads was... They killed them? And you just hid? What? What kind of coward are you? - Oh, my God. - Mum? -Is she one of them, Dan? No. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. No! Mum. Mum. Mum, uh... Okay. - Okay. - Ben. - It's okay. - What are you doing? I just want to see if it's possible, okay? Y-You don't know what she was planning, Ben. You don't know what Martha was planning. Well, she can't do anything now. - Don't do this. - Are you scared she might be right? - Don't do it, Ben. - Do you like being better than me? - No... - Do you like my misery? I was the only one who ever tried with you, Ben. Oh, well, thank you. Hey... what... No! Identified patient, Thomas Hatfield. Alba. Would you like to resume Hawking 1.0? Wait... w-what is Hawking 1.0? Neo-eugenics genome editing. Transcranial direct-current stimulation to strengthen human adaptive reasoning and empathy. Eugenics? She was right. You were the first one. Shut down, Alba. Shut down. Overriding Alba. - What? Wait, no! - Establishing pathway to Thomas Hatfield. - Wait, who's doing that? - It's them. They're in the machine, Ben! They're in the fucking machine! - Ben! Ben, get me out. - What do you mean, Tom? Ben, turn it off! Ben, Ben, look at me, look at me, look at me. Look at me. Hey! Hey! You've got to get me out. Get me out, Ben. Hey, hey, shut it down. Opening gateway to Thomas Hatfield. No, no, no, please... Tom. What do you see? There's millions, Ben. They're coming! They're coming, Ben. Turn it off! Turn it off, Ben! - What the fuck? - What happened? The Feed crashed. No. What's going on? The Feed is down? Everywhere? The whole thing? No, impossible. When people discover what's happened, they'll flood here. Close the borders, now. My family. I need to get to my family. How will you even find them without the Feed? Tom? The Feed's gone down. Huh? Tom? Tom? Tom, please... Tom... Tom... Do you know what you've done? All those people dead. Do you know what you've fucking done? It'll come back on. It'll come back on. No, it won't. Tom. What are we gonna do? I'm gonna find Kate. We have to leave the city. What are you doing? Where are you going? Hey, where are you going? You're hurt. - You need to come with me. - I need my baby. - No, you need to listen to me... - I need to find Tom and my baby. Help! The hospital must be here somewhere. Jesus Christ. What are we gonna do? Stop! Stop! Let's go. It's okay. Tom. Tom. Tom, open the fucking door. Tom! Open the... Open the fucking door, Tom! You know you're better than this, Tom. Don't do this to me. I thought we were brothers. Huh? What happened to that? Mum's gone, Tom. You're dead. You're fucking dead, Tom! Tom! You're fucking dead!
