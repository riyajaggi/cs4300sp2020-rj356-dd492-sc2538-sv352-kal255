 Share your life. Your memories, mundles, are safe forever. Tom, I... I re-I remember. I... I'm so sorry. Look, it's me, okay? It's me, it's Max. Please, just help me. Please. You shouldn't trust anything he says. Let me out of these fucking things! I know. - Why are you all in here? - If you think his feed has been hacked, - you-you need to turn it off. You need to delete it... - Tom. Look, if he's fighting something in his head, we need to

 induce a coma to prevent further harm. Then we'll plug his transmitter directly into the main server - so we can examine it. - You can't cut into his neck like some kind of fucking animal. What if you put him to sleep and whatever this is completely takes over? Hmm? Isn't this how it happened in the first place? Yes, that's what I found. If we put Max into a coma, we can't monitor him. How will we know that Max is... is Max? Maybe if we'd have kept closer eyes on him to begin with. I'm sorry, Evelyn. If there's anything I can do to help. There isn't. Go. Sue Cole is on her way. I'll see what I can get out of her and if she knows who might be doing this. I'll come with you if you like. She'd prefer me on my own. You guys, I'm-I'm hurt. I... Please, I need a ho... I need a hospital, guys, please. Ignore him. He's been medically cleared for interrogation. Uh, where you going? To find a doctor. Look, I-I'm only gonna see Max's friend Abel. You... Just wait for me. How long will that be? Jane's driving me back to London. We'll be off in case your dad's monitoring, okay? - You'll be safe? - Yeah. If things get hairy... Hey. I've got my human shield. That's not funny. I love you. I love you, too. Mum. Hmm? Not even a fucking heads up? Ben, darling, it's not all about you. I'm sorry. These people... Whoever they are... They're coming after us. After the company. I want you to find us somewhere safe. Has it come to that? If it does. All right, I'll pull Max's contacts. Set Ms. Cole to collect his scuzzy friends and see if they know anything about what's happening to him, okay? Good idea. Yeah. I have them every now and then. It was my turn to make breakfast. You don't use enough haggis. Oh, that's right. I do need to give boiled organs another chance. I like you the way you are. How about lunch? Today? - Out? - They're gonna find out sooner or later. Mrs. Hatfield will understand. Yeah, and Ben will get you fired. Then we'll get to spend more time together. I don't like lying to them. You're such a sap. I like me the way I am. They never give you any credit. They really don't. They didn't even tell me what happened to Max. And I'm working here day and night. You discovered the glitch. You should've been the first call. Maybe your dad feels threatened by you. Yeah. Maybe he does. He certainly gets amnesia when it comes to all the shit I get done. I, uh... I was wondering if you wanted anything? A coffee? A croissant? Oh, she's sweet. No, Natalie. I'm fan-fucking-tastic. Now can you go back to your desk, earn your above-average salary, and actually do some fucking work? Pull Maxwell Vaughn's files. I need his contacts, ASAP. How do I make you happy? You can't! You're pathetic. I know. No one likes you. I know. I don't even like you. I know. Why the fuck are you like this? You made me this way. Decrease self-awareness. Age back. Stop. Even younger. Jesus, Ben. Missed your birthday. Let me apologize, for everything. Lunch? Evie. Evie, look at me. Evie. We need to ask you some questions, Max. If you want to help us, you need to be very honest with us. I will, Mr. Hatfield. Just please tell me what is happening. Why do you think you're here? I... I don't know. Try. Something told me... made me look at Bea... at the farm. I... I had a bow. - I hurt Tom. - Why, Max? What made you do that? I don't know. Evie, what's happening to me? Please tell me I'm not like the oth... th... How does it feel, Max? Like everything's getting darker. Mr. Hatfield. Feels like... I'm-I'm being... taken away. Why? Honestly, I don't know how they do it. I mean, since his dad left, my living wage went up a little bit, but still... And what was it my dad used to always say? "People need bus drivers." I'm telling you, Dad. Doctor's appointment at 3:00. I've got the schedule right here. Ah... Over here. You're not to go on, Danny. Totally off. Well played. F... Fuck off. F-Fuck off. Mum, can we go shop? Ask Devan if he'll walk you. He limps. What about Danny? No, Arian, Danny's too... Danny's too what? Danny's too slow. You can't even kick a ball, you idiot. - Yo, what's up, man? - Fuck my neighbors. - What? - I mean, fuck them kids. Fuck my fucking mum. I don't fucking need anyone. Yeah. No one wasn't helping me. - Always taking the piss. - Yeah, for sure, fam, for sure. Really... you're actually gonna speak about your mum like that? - I broke my arm, - MARCUS: I know. - My head, I sprayed it all! - I know! - That show was tight. - Look at you... You're getting all angry. It can't be the Russians. They've just renegotiated their contract. We're not getting very far with India. Where are you getting your intel? Sue, would you tell me? Meredith, what's going on? I've had reports of an emergency entering the Hub before dawn. You're watching us? You can talk to me. Who is targeting you? I was hoping you could tell me. If we're playing quid pro quo here, Sue, I have very little to bring to the table. All we've got is a list of names for interrogation. Uh-uh. I don't recognize any of these names. Offliners rumored to be housing Resisters. They may put up a fight. No guns, please. Keep this quiet. That goes without saying. Hi. We're friends of Max Vaughn. Are you Abel? Depends. He said you could maybe help us. What do you want? Someone better than this. We need a doctor. You think 'cause I'm off, I don't watch the news? I know who you are. What are you doing? Follow me. I can help. Tia. Meet Kate Hatfield. She wants a doctor. What is this place? You're Resisters. If you're trying to spray us to the cops, don't bother. You can't get on here. Stay the fuck back or I'll mace your eyes to shit! Open the fucking door, old man. Well, you need a doctor, we can help. So let's all just chill out. Put the blade down. I will. After you let us go. I can't do that. Why the fuck not? Because you're Kate bloody Hatfield. Daughter-in-law of the Feed no longer wants it? You know something. There's no going back, Kate. Tell me everything. Geez, Dan, where are you even at, man? Police ain't gonna find no Resisters. They don't know the ends like a real rat. You going hunting, Dan? - Yeah, nice knowing you. - There's a reward, right? Look in some alleys, pop out my chest. I know how to spot a lagger. I'll get the money for my own pad. Something sweet... view of the Shard, room service. Right, like anyone's ever gonna serve you caviar, Dan. - Keep dreaming. - Shut it, Marcus. Oi! Watch what you're doing, you fucking pricks. Danny, bruv, Resister. Oh! Yo, Dan! Dan! Dan, get out of there, bro. Danny. Get out of there. Dan... Mate, what's happening to me? I mean, it's getting darker. More and more. I mean, look at you. Did I really put an arrow through your fucking shoulder? Yeah. But I stabbed you in the leg, so... we're even. I'm gonna speak to you as a patient now. - Is that okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I think. - If you think that would work, I... - Please close your eyes. I'll start with an anchoring question. What is your name? - Maxwell Vaughn. - Great. Can you describe to me the last time you felt safe, Max? Before all of this happened? I was back at the farm. There was flowery bedding in my room. It made me laugh. Good. And if you start feeling uncomfortable or tense, just think of that room and breathe. - Okay? - Okay. What do you remember from before the farm? I was gonna... I was gonna ask Evelyn to m... to marry me. You don't need to watch this. No one would blame you. It's okay. It's all right. I'm-I'm fine. I just... Ask him about the Feed Resisters in Russia. What can you tell me about... Dude, is that... is... is that Polish? I was just thinking about Anton. Try another language. Hindi. These questions, they, they might feel strange, but they are relevant, I promise. We just want to make sure that what happened to Anton and Sara... doesn't happen to you. I appreciate that. Stop explaining yourself, Tom, and ask him when he first felt something was wrong. I need to understand if he knows what's hap... Well, fuck. Let's talk about something else, okay? Come back. Yes, yeah. Yeah? - Sure. - Okay. Shall we talk about us? The first time we met? Ben's wedding. - That's right, Ben's wedding. - When you met Kate. Good memory. Stellar night. Well, stupid waste of money, in my opinion, but open bar. And Sara was there. The first person this happened to. Yeah. Poor woman. And Anton, just a kid. I... I'm scared, Tom. I... I don't want to end up like the others. It's okay. What's your name? Max Vaughn. Right. You know who you are. I'm not sure anymore. Sara and Anton. They died because of a mistake. We're not gonna let that happen to you. You're the one who likes to keep people safe. You're the one who's good at keeping people safe. I mean, you were there to save us at the wedding, grabbing at Sara, even though she had a knife. What would you do without me? I didn't grab Sara, did I? Who did? Gil? No. You? It was probably Kate, right? She's a keeper, Thomas. I've enjoyed our little session. But if you're expecting to treat me for split personality disorder, you are gravely out of your depth. Lawrence must really be grasping at straws. Hatfield went inside your head and enabled your baby? That's fucked up. ICSA went inside my girlfriend's head. Saw she liked to hack pedophiles, expose their fucked up shit to their families. They arrested her for peddling child porn. She's still in pen. - We supposed to feel sorry for you? - No. - I'm just saying, so the fuck what? - What? So he gave it to your kid, of course he did. That doesn't mean you cut your fucking head open. Or hers. What the hell is really going on? Don't move! - Police! - Did you fucking spray us? - Destroy the comps. - Police! Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Maybe I can talk to them. Police. Come on. Okay. Let's go. Come on. Forget about it. Let's go. Keep going. They'll be on us soon. - Just let me go. - I'm not kidnapping you, - you fucking twat, I'm saving you. - Is that what this is? The cops find a Hatfield mixing with us, we're all fucked. Go on. Who are you? What are you? Are you a hacker? You can probably go now. - Daddy's here. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. He's fine. Since you called me out by name, I thought I'd show my face. Do you know how Tom figured you out? At the farm, when he told you Anton and Sara were dead, well, apparently you cried, didn't you? Were they people you knew? Were you friends? Were you close? They're dead now, anyway. Ah, yes, there was another incident in Chile. A man tried to kill his wife. We got him. We blew his fucking brains out. We'll kill all your friends... You fucking idiot. Who are you? Max Vaughn. - Why did you attack Tom? - To kill him. - Do you want to kill me? - Yes. - Do you want to kill me? - Yes. - Are you afraid? - Not even close. - What's your name? - Dar... Mm. Max Vaughn. I think I'm tired now. Whoever that is, he was going to say a different name. "Dar..." All right, that's not Max. It's someone else. - That's impossible. - Yet here we are. He's not some hacker sat somewhere in his, in his fucking underwear. It came out when we brought up Sara and Anton. They're his trigger. He cares about them. It's not what you think it is. It's like he's, like he's been possessed, taken over. But Sara and Anton gouged their eyes out. Max didn't. Whatever it is, it's evolving. Raid! They're coming! Burn it! What is this place? The less you know, the better. Kate, you have to do something. You have to help us. Look what's happening. Look where we are. People deserve to know. Police! Police! It's a raid! Get out! - Get out! - Police! Through the window! Go! - Go. - Okay. Armed police! You're under arrest! Don't move! Come on, you bastard! Tia! No! No! No! No! No! Get the fuck away! Come on! Go! Get up! Get up! Come on, you've got to go. Come on, you got to hurry up. Get up. Tia! Get to Dr. Adu! Hey, welcome back. You all right? No use here, mate. This mind is clean. Easy. You're pretty mashed up. Come here. Here. Pop two of these in your mouth. It's ibuprofen, for this. What's your name? D-D-D-Da-Dan. D-D-D-Danny. You're one of those. Don't suppose you can write, either? All right, well, maybe I'll just call you The Little Mermaid. This feels a bit like that. I would've called you an ambulance, but it's not safe with the crackdown on Offliners. You picked a really shit neighborhood to get beaten up in. Don't think anything's broken, though. We'll have you back on your fins ASAP. Just got to get some bandages. Update mofos. I'm in the belly of an Offliner's gaff. Watch this space. I'm sorry I came to your place the other day. Sometimes I short-circuit. Work was stressful. And I know you think I'm self-absorbed and that I put unfair expectations on you, and I did. I'm sorry. But you expected a lot as well. Ah, there it is. You know what, Ben? No one puts higher expectations on you than yourself. I mean, where was that goofy uni kid who used to sleep all day - and just rock up to the pub? - I only slept late because you would come home pissed and talking to me in Japanese. Well, I'm sure whatever I had to say was immensely important. Yeah, "I'm hungry, fix food." Thank God for translate, otherwise, you'd have starved. Yeah, that's right. Those protein shakes really hit the spot. This. This is what I miss. But this was like, what, three percent of the time? I just don't want you to read too much into it. I miss you, but... - not like that. - Of course. That ship has sailed, like the Titanic. I think you were married to the idea of marriage, Ben. I don't think you were married to me. Well, tell that to my wedding ring. I know you still care. I'm seeing someone. Gil, I'm-I'm seeing Gil, and I... and he... he wanted to tell you, we did, but I just, I didn't know how. Not like fucking this. Fucking Gil? He can't even conjugate verbs. That is beyond petty. You don't even know him. I work with him every fucking day. You still don't know him. Uh-huh, go. Don't worry about me. I've got this. I've spent the last two years worrying about you, Ben, and I'm tired. You think about yourself enough for the both of us anyway. Have fun with that. Natalie said you were in here. She knows everything. She should have Ben's job. When Max visits me at work, we come to this room. Afternoon delight, done in ten. I keep remembering having sex with him. It's all I can think about, and using this fucking tattoo like we're in some kind of fantasy game. I want to remember his mole-like morning face, or boring conversations about hiking, his obsession with birch. Birch? Like the tree? They're very tolerant and comes in a range of colors. Max liked that. You're talking about him like... Like he's dead? He is dying, Tom. Someone's taking him away. My dad wants to induce Max's coma. It's your call. I need to see him first. It's not him. Then we need to figure out a way to put him back. Whoever that is... You had at least another ten minutes of ice. I know, I only use it when I'm hungover. You feeling better? - Do you want to try? - Y-Yes. Your fingers are too weak to play properly. You can't even hold the notes down. Thought I knew what I was getting into when I joined them. Wasn't for me. Whoa! Stop the press! Mozart's a Resister! Sorry they kicked the shit out of you. People are on edge. You okay? Okay, we need to go, now. This doctor's gonna be here, right? - How much further? - We're nearly there. Don't worry, we'll be safe here. These were all factories in my day. I think one of them made the red post boxes. - How's Bea? - She's good. Probably wondering when this became a police state. Seriously. I haven't been gone that long. Ask her in-laws. I've got nothing to do with them. Course not. We're here. - Abel, they got you, too? - I know. I'm fine. This lady needs to see a doc. Dr. Adu. Okay, come on. I'll take it from here. Take a seat. You should be safe from here. Sure you don't need a hospital? Happy to walk you. I don't think we're there yet, but sure, a pint would be great. Delete or share? Delete. Images deleted. Each operation lasts up to six hours. I have a small team of nurses assisting. Given you've had the transmitter for ten years, it makes it slightly more complex, but... nothing I've not seen before, or can't handle. So you're a real doctor? Um, Royal College of Surgeons. You'll be awake during the procedure, uh, so we can test your reflexes - and ask you questions. - You seem capable. I wish I'd had someone like you. I'm happy to take a look? Jane. I'll just be outside. I'm guessing a service - like this isn't free. - I'm sorry, but... maintaining the equipment, paying my support staff, we... can't do it for any less than 10,000. That covers the three of you. Uh, we can't use money or transfers. It's suspicious. Art or jewelry will do. Book us in. As soon as possible. - I have tomorrow morning. - No, that's too soon. We can't. The raids are getting more intense. We need to change location. After tomorrow, this place won't exist. Tomorrow, then. So what do we do now? Meredith? Meredith. With the SAVEYOU, we can upload an older version of Max into his body. It's never been done on a human subject. But that's why you created it. Right? As a backup. Yes, but Max wasn't always on; there'd be gaps. But he'll be there. I can't say. I would have to plug his transmitter directly into the main server and make sure that everything is wiped, then the upload process could begin. But the procedure will be very painful. Like a digital exorcism? Well... that's rather crude, but not inaccurate. This was designed for synths. I don't know what would happen. It's better than the alternative. Get off me. Get the fuck off me! Get your hands... Fucking, fucking hands off me! Get off me! Evie! You bitch, you're killing me! Get off me, get the fuck off me! Fuck off me! Connecting the transmitter to the server. Connection complete. Deactivation initiated. The anger was a good sign. It means he was scared. It means it could work. Subject, Maxwell Vaughn. Deletion complete. SAVEYOU, Maxwell Vaughn. Upload begun. Tom, I've found a doctor. The appointment's first thing tomorrow. Can we talk? I'm outside. How is he? We'll find out when he wakes up. I need to stay here overnight. No, surgery's early tomorrow morning. I-If I can help stop it at the source, then maybe we don't need to put ourselves - through the procedure. - Tom, this is our only chance. Kate... Kate, look at me. We're close. If I can work this out then... then we can sleep. Just give me till the morning. Please. Till the morning. For Max. Tell your dad I said hi. Delete app. Delete app. No. The app. It's fucking hacked. I'm the bloody breach. Delete all apps. Delete, delete, delete, delete. Corruption. There is a corruption. Well... the swelling's gone down. Which is good. You are a very fast healer. Um... this is my number. If you can figure out how to use it. Hi. I'm aware you're confused. I need you to tell me your full name and today's date. Maxwell Jeremiah Vaughn. It's... June fifth. Well, it's actually the sixth, but, uh... Wha... What's-what's happening? Max. - Can you tell me where we met? - Um... It was... at the farm. You dropped your paddle in the canoe. I played hero... and you kissed me. - No tongue. - Yes. Was-was I in an accident? Yes. Yeah, you were, mate. But you're okay. Why am I strapped down? You were struggling against your meds. We didn't want you to hurt yourself. Like Sara and Anton. I'll give you some space. Mate, get me some treats. Flax seeds? Fuck that. Chocolate. Hmm. Hi. Hey. He seems back. Yes. I need to run a few more tests, but if they're successful, he could be released soon. I knew you could do it. What? Break him. Get him to make a mistake. And I knew you could do it on your own, I just... - didn't want you to have to. - Yeah, I'm a big boy. Yes, but you're not cruel. That kind of thing comes easier to me. I'm sorry if I've behaved in an uncivil manner recently. What you just did with Max... was brilliant. I'm... me and Ev... we're grateful. But it doesn't solve everything. It's a cure, it's not an answer. Hmm. I've asked for the bodies of Anton and Sara to be brought in so we can take a look at their transmitters, see if we can find anything. Can you stay? I need your help to interpret what's in Sara's Feed. We make a good team. You know, everything I do in my work... in my life... has been about making the world a better place than it was before I arrived. I don't wake up thinking, "How can I hurt the people around me today?" I know bad things happen and my methods are sometimes unorthodox. And I'm hardly the model father, nor the model grandfather, but I do care. And I do sincerely want to fix this. I can give you an hour. Hmm. Let's go. Are you sure? - He said he'd be here. - But he's not.
