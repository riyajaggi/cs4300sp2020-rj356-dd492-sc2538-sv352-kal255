 Share your life. Your memories, mundles, are safe forever. Rise and shine, Lawrence. Ah, for God's sake, Meredith. Time to start repairing the damage you've caused. Right, well, get me put back on Feed. Meredith. You'll get your access back pending a review. Until then, your Feed is blocked. Oh, fuck their review. Sue Cole's in over her head. Who's the Frenchman? Who's the French fucker in Sara's mundles? You don't know.

 Nobody does. Somebody should. Only I want to, so how can I find the answer? Meredith, get me back on! I don't have anything. What am I supposed to do? What if I fall down the fucking stairs? How will I call for help? Mrs. Hatfield! Is Mr. Hatfield going to make a statement? Have you spoken to the prime minister yet? Are you gonna step down, Mrs. Hatfield? Have you spoken to the Prime Minis... She's a liar! A criminal! Ugh. Stay off. Now, me and Max here, we have a deal. He turns on his Feed, you die. You turn on your Feed... you die. Either way, you die. You understand? Yes. Up. Ow! Ah. - Steady. - At least let her just put something on. Of course. No. Dress like you're going to work. What the fuck? Officers. Step out of the vehicle, please. Why? Step out of the vehicle, please. Look, I'm here on behalf of the Hatfields. If there's a problem, you can tell me. We're not at liberty to say. Is this about Mr. Hatfield? Is Mrs. Hatfield okay? - It's not about that. - I'm wearing a gun... You're wanted for questioning. Why? What's going on? - Is Tom cut off now? - Fucking Hatfields! I've never been so popular. Just stay off for a bit. Things will calm down. - It'll be better in America. - Yes. You are gonna love the lake. Lots of paths to break your board in. Smash up that cute little face. Actually, that could be quite good, because that way people won't recognize me. - Yeah? - Yeah. We could change our names. Do I look like an Isabella? - Mm... - Maybe an heiress whose mother mysteriously fell off a yacht. - I pushed her off. - What? Yes. I pushed your mum off a boat. Oh. The things you wouldn't do for love. Yeah. I'm moving to Michigan for it. God, I miss this. It'll be better in America. Yeah. Yeah, well, we've got to be at the airport for 2:00. Yeah. I'll be quick. - Hey. - Mm? You did the right thing. I know it was hard... but you did. At least the world knows what he is. Yeah. I'll see you at Evelyn's. Airport at 2:00. Whoa-hoa! - All right, all right. - Whoa! Slow. - Slow. Slow. - Here we go. What do you mean, slow? I've barely pulled you two inches here. Ha-ha! That's what he said. - Don't be a wuss. - Hey, man, I've got to take care of this beautiful mug. I'm a strapping single lad. - You want to talk about it? - Not with you. - You're leaving me. - We can still chat. - How, if you ain't on? - Well, we can write. - You heard of a pen? - What the hell is that? Hey, bro, you got to teach me that. - All right. - Hey, hey! You should probably learn to stand on it first. You're the coldest bruv I know. Striking people out, left, right and... Sorry, I... I-I didn't mean nothing, all right? I know, I know. It's fine. You talk to your dad since? Yeah, once. It didn't go well. What? I'm just surprised, that's all. I mean, if I said something like that to my mum, ooh-wee, I'd be six feet deep, crying from a coffin. "Come on, Mum, please. I'm sorry. "I'm sorry I'm a piece of shit." "I'm choking on my farts down here!" Yeah. Get on your board. Come on. Hey, man. You asked. All right. Here you go. You're on your own, baby. Hey! Whoo-whoo! Whoo... You should probably go and get that. Kate. Look, I'm-I'm really sorry. I'm gonna be late. I can't leave without saying something to my mum and Ben. I can't. You said you'd be an hour. We have time. Fine. I'll see you at Evie's. Meredith. This is Gwen Ashe. She'll be replacing Gil Tomine as your security for the time being. We've replaced the rest of Gil's team as well. That team was vetted. So was Gil. And yet we found him with this highly illegal app. Your top security aid is here for questioning. Whatever those takers are, they're targeting you. Get off me! Get yourselves off! Get off me! You're hurting me! You're hurting me! Get off me! We've got almost all of them. Haiti and Oxford are still trying to track down the last two. The others are either en route here or being brought to their local hubs. We've confirmed they were all taken in their sleep. The public aren't questioning anything yet. They think they're either Resisters or hackers. But if this keeps happening, we'll have a shitstorm. We need to review suspects. You must know more than you think you do. Look, I've told you, we don't know who's doing this. Maybe he does. Hey. Spent all morning at the processing center giving them hell. Tia will be released today. Jane, you're a badass. Thank your mother-in-law, actually. She made good on their promise. Grief is a powerful drug. She's not completely a terrible person. Just... complicated. You sure you're okay to take Bea today? - Of course. We're pals now. - I just don't feel comfortable leaving her with anyone else, you know? My botched Feed comes in handy, after all. I'll only be a few hours. I'm gonna check on Evie and Max, and then I'll meet you at the airport? Take your time. We'll be fine. Hey. Bye, baby. I was just... You know, I-I came by to... I don't know, just to say good-bye, I guess. I'm sorry, Tom. So am I. I didn't realize you'd be saddled with everything. I don't think I actually realized what would happen. We should have told you. If we had, if we'd... told you it was genetic... would you have had Bea? No. But I wouldn't give her back for anything, and I would do anything to protect her. That's why I don't understand why you've done what you've done to me, to Ben. Ben is fine. He didn't get your Feed. I know why he didn't get my Feed. Dad told me. You have to tell him. It would destroy him. He's gonna find out. Mum? I have to go. More takers have come through. What? How many? 30. We're bringing the ones we know about in for treatment. That's... it? What else can I do, Tom? Fuck! You've got balls, I'll give you that. Showing your face here after what you did. Kate and I are gonna stay with her family for a bit. I wanted to... see you before I left. Pull the detonator, run from the blast. We've been planning to go for a while now, Ben. I... I'm sorry... it came like this. I'd like to leave on good terms. We haven't been on good terms for years. - Just go. - No. We used to be. You were Belle to my Ariel. We're not friends, Tom. You went away, and you became... whoever this is. Getting some distance from Dad... It helped me figure some things out. I think you should try the same. You are the last person I would ever take advice from. - He needs me now. - No. He doesn't, Ben. He doesn't care. That's the problem. That's always been the problem. I didn't mean you... Get out. You just destroyed our father. For revenge. - Revenge? - Do you think I have anything to say to you? Get the fuck out, Tom! I didn't do it because of revenge, Ben. - Right. Sure. - I did this - because he's out of control. - Uh-huh. He needs someone monitoring him, making sure that no one else gets hurt, making sure he actually figures out what happened to Max. He can't do this alone. Well, now... he can't do it at all. Have a nice flight. Ev? Evie? Max? You home? Ev? Ev? Ev? I've let myself in, and... I'm sorry, but you've not been on, and I'm starting to get worried. Evie? They're gone. How do you expect us to get into the Hub? That's not the issue. It's how you're gonna get me past level nine security. - What's that? - It's where Meredith and Lawrence's offices are. - Aah. - You don't have to hold the knife so close. We're not gonna go on. You have too much sympathy. Who are you? Oh, thank you for asking, Evelyn. I used to be an accountant before I got made redundant. I couldn't take sitting around every week, collecting a BLI, nothing to do. What other skills did I have? But now? Now's a different story. Now I know all kinds of things, like if I push the knife through your rib cage... I'll puncture your lung. You'll get something called tension pneumothorax. You'll slowly suffocate. And every breath you take will only make it worse. See, I know these things now. But then? Nah, then, I was just a stupid cunt. So I killed myself. You think I don't see you playing eye footsie? The car so much as hits a speed bump, she'll be sushi. Um... where was I? Um, you t-t-tried to kill yourself. Oh, right. I'm dead. You're a fucking psychopath is what you are. - Max! - No. It's okay, Evelyn. He's right. So how long have you had the app? As long as whoever put it there put it there. It's not easy to get. You have to go down some pretty shady back alleys of the dark Net for that kind of twisted material. That alone is illegal. Not to mention it's in direct breach of the government contract employees have to sign to work here. So you're looking for someone stupid - and driven. - You know it's been leaking information to the Resisters? To whomever else bought the info, as well, I'd imagine. That's... that's what those apps do. So why did you download it? I didn't. You've got the wrong guy. How long have you worked for the Hatfields? I reckon you know that already. Grunt to grunt. Don't be a shit. Near 15 years. But you've known them for... - Near 20. - How? Mr. and Mrs. Hatfield gave a scholarship to my boy's home. I won it. They took an interest in me after that, looked out for me. And this is how you repay them? Did you resent them? All that money. Two perfect little boys, not a want in the world. And then there was you. You've got the wrong guy. It's like talking to Parliament. I'm getting nowhere. Well, the guilty ones always deny it. So do the innocent. I've never known Gil to lie. No. He just omits truths. He downloaded an illegal app and leaked information. Do you really believe him over the evidence? I know he would never betray us. So you know about him and Miyu, do you? Look, if he's twisted enough to shag her behind our backs, what else is he capable of? I know he's your pet project, but he's not some noble man. He's always wanted more. You know him better than I do. If Gil says he didn't do it, he didn't. Start looking for the person who did! Mum... Dad? You didn't hear me? What are you doing here? I... I was hoping to talk to you. Actually, you can be of some... use. Sit down. What are you doing? I need to use your Feed. Sit down. What? Why? I think I know who the Frenchman was. - No. Dad... - I need my files. Hold still. All right, now go on. No. Ben... go on. R-Rust and star-tar-tar-dust, baby-y. What the hell is that? That... That's... what I wanted to talk to you about. - Quiet. - Eric? Eric, we, uh, uh, we have, uh... we have your ring. - Tom? - What? - Are you okay? - Hey. Yeah. Just Lara and-and Eric... they... they want us to swing by and check on the place. They left kind of last-minute. They left this behind, actually. They didn't have time to set the locks. - How long they plan to be gone? - A few days. - They took the dog? - Uh-huh. First time that thing's been quiet in years. Well, leave the chain, water the plants and show yourselves out? Okay. Thank you. Come on. Hello? Hello? We just knocked for five minutes. Yeah, I know. Look, I-I-I just... I-I missed her. I tried to make it work, but she didn't... She wouldn't listen to me. So you downloaded an app that's a known risk to our company so you can vicariously fuck a teenager? What? No. I was just playing around with it. I'm not some pedo. You weakened our server. I know. I'm sorry, Dad. It was a mistake. Please. Please, delete her. I-I tried to do it myself but she... she... corrupted. I can't get rid of her. Every time I go on, she's there. And Sue Cole is looking through our Feeds. She's gonna find it. Good. Let her. You know what, don't judge me. Don't pretend that you haven't used the Feed for your own perversions, too. Tinkering and experimenting and playing around in people's lives. You created a system that's literally killing people. So what you've done is a hell of a lot worse. A-And what are you doing about it, by the way? Fucking about up here trying to pin it on the Resisters. That's why Tom did what he did. That's why he hates you. I'm not a bad person, Dad. I'm still your son. I'm still me. But you wouldn't know who that is because you've never bothered to find out, have you? You haven't earned your self-righteous judgment. You're not my son. You haven't earned my name. That's nice. Classy. Father of the Year, ladies and gentlemen. Wait! I still need your Feed. I'd have done anything for you. Ben! Ben! You need to relax, Ben. We never play anymore. Pull Miyu Hatfield in. Your access to Lawrence Hatfield's files is currently denied. Are you sure this is the right guy? I only found one couple in London who got married on Christmas day with the same initials on the ring. I mean, this has got to be them, right? Have you ever heard Max or Evelyn mention their names? Either one? No. - We shouldn't be here, Tom. - There was blood on the carpet, Kate, okay, and this guy's Feed has been off for days. Why? Huh? Why? Well, then, we should try the police again. They said it hasn't been long enough. It's only been a few hours. A ring and a stain is not enough to get them out here. So we're just breaking into a stranger's house? If you want to go, go. I'm gonna try the Hub again. They're probably there getting Max checked. Nothing? Come on. Let's have a look around and see what we find. - Is this about leaving? - What? Do you not want to go? - You know I do. - No, I don't. - You're doing everything possible to avoid it. - Kate. No, that's not true. What? I just, I-I'm... I keep... I don't know if I did the right thing. Okay? I thought I was saving people from him, and now he's fired, my mum is drowning, and Ben is staring down the barrel of a DNA gun. I just... I'm not sure if it's the right time to go. No. No, no. Your parents brought this on themselves. Look, we-we find Max and Evie and then we go to the airport, okay? All right. Okay. I'm... Let's just look around for a bit. And then we go. Right. Shh. Thank you. Credentials. You're to tell me your name and who you're representing, you first. Chris Monkwell. Morning Courier. Amber Wallerton. Press Daily. Claire Leabridge. National Reporter. You spray live, that's the deal. Let her in. Thank you. Mr. Hatfield! You've still given us no answers. Mr. Hatfield, don't walk away! What are you doing?! You're hurting me! Mrs. Hatfield, are we...? Um... some people are starting to ask about this treatment. Why we have to go through the transmitter. Irreparable brain trauma caused damage to their Feed. Direct access to the transmitter is required to restore their essence. You want to send that mother home to her son, don't you, Natalie? Yes, Mrs. Hatfield. Then that's what you tell people. No! - Quiet. - Get off me! I don't quite know where to start. Well, don't make me regret choosing you. Why am I here? Why are you doing this? You don't do many interviews. Damage control. Now, ask me something you really want to know. And spray it live, as per our agreement. Why do you think you're better than me? Than everyone? Well, there you go. I think that because I am. I am what is known as "neurally efficient." My brain displays less metabolic activity than the average human, such as yourself or Sue Cole. But I simply, scientifically, function at a higher level. So you're the smartest man in the world? No, I didn't say that. I said I'm smarter than you. There are about 200 people worldwide who function at my level. We all know each other, for the most part. Do you all collude to manipulate our lives? Yes. In a way, we do; if we didn't, you'd all die. Now, I know that that sounds like hyperbole to someone like you, but the fact is, the human race was not built to withstand itself. Sanitation, vaccines, penicillin and so on and so forth, these are all the inventions of single individuals and the rest of humanity are merely beneficiaries. Oh, you're our heroes, then? Most of us are trying to help. What about the rest? Pray they don't win. Is that why you've enabled people without their consent? To win? Public alarmism obscures the expansive benefits of the Feed and is fundamentally misplaced. Public alarmism keeps men with your egos in check. Just because your brain may work more efficiently than others, it doesn't mean that you know what's best for everyone. Well, that's what you'd all like to believe, but realistically, while you're looking at one, two, maybe even as many as, I don't know, seven different scenarios, I'm looking at thousands. I'm seeing the past, the present, the future all at once. Now that's not ego, that's just a fact. You think you know the future? Care to share it with the rest of us? No. Attempts to edit me out of the equation are detrimental to the human race and to the Feed as it stands. If you want to know what I know, if you want to save yourself, if we all want to save ourselves, then I need to be brought back in. You're angling for reinstatement. This is a threat. No. It's not a threat. It's an offer. Are you smart enough to accept it? Your son saw you as a menace. Does that make him as dumb as the rest of us? I've said everything I've got to say, thank you. You can go now. What was that? What does he know? - More than we do. - I'm bringing him in. He's making us look like fools. We need to control him. Tom? Tom, come here. What is that smell? Oh, fuck. He works at the Hub. What? Come on. What do you want me to do? Stay off. Both of you. Max Welbourne, visitor, clear. Evelyn Kearn. Employee. Clear. Eric Bell. Employee. Clear. We're coworkers. What now? Shut up and park. Ben? Ben? Natalie has prepared our three patients for treatment. Can you oversee? I'm nothing if not your loyal servant. I've just got to do something first. Thanks. What the hell, Ben? I'm forced to come here in the middle - of treating a patient, but... - I have some bad news. - You might want to sit down. - What do you want? Okay, what I'm about to tell you is purely for your own protection. - I'm concerned for you. - Is this about Gil? Why can't I reach him, Ben? - Is he okay? - Believe me, I hate to be telling you this, but I just felt that you should know. Maybe just get to the fucking point. Some... questionable information surfaced when the company ran a scan of Gil's Feed. If this is your way of making up shit just to be fun... It isn't, Miyu. What the fuck is this? He created a version of you that he could do anything to. He made you his whore. His mute fantasy. He wouldn't do that. I wish I was making this up, but even I couldn't think of something this repulsive. He tried to delete the app when he found out about the company's sweep, but... it's corrupted. It resulted in this. You're wanted for questioning, Miyu. Look after your mother for me. Miyu. Miyu? Security says Eric Bell was on the grounds. At least he was. They can't find him anywhere, and they can't access his Feed. Well, then, where's Gil? - Who's in charge if he isn't? - I don't know. I can only get on with this-this security guy, Bruce. He won't put me on to anyone. This is crazy. So, my mum's not answering. Ben, either. Where the fuck are they? Who's at the Hub? Breathe. Upload of SAVEYOU initiated. So start talking. Get me back on, and I will. - You'd rather be right than righteous. - No, no, no, no. I'd rather be right than wrong. People's lives hang in the balance. Yeah. I've got 30 of them locked up, confused and wanting answers. Do you even know anything? Well, I need access to my files so I can work out how a dead man's mundles ended up in Sara Hoyt's head. I've got my people on that. You won't find anything. Yes. His name was Francois Thomas. What at first looked like a car accident was in fact the result of a spasm caused by a brain tumor. So I looked into his treatment for the tumor, and much of it happened right here. - What does that mean? Did you know him? - Possibly. Could mean any number of things. That's what I'm trying to find out. I can't let you on, Lawrence. I can't trust you. Then we're at an impasse. Let us have access to your files, and I'll put you back on. Well, that would be like me handing you my brain on a plate. That is the only way to resolve this. I don't actually need your help. I've come this far without it. Don't you dare walk out of here. You've done so well, Evelyn. Just two more doors, and you can go. You can't just walk out of here. You are within my jurisdiction. What are you going to do, arrest me? I will if I have to. You're the one impeding an investigation. - Where's Evelyn? - Lawrence, stop it. Or Natalie or Shawn or any fucking coder will do. No, no, no, no, no. You should think very carefully about what - you're about to do. - Sue, this is absurd. He is negligently withholding evidence, Meredith. I'm within my bounds. Oh, thank God. Why haven't you been answering? - I'm being arrested. - You're perverting - the course of justice. - Can you just give us a moment? He's had enough allowances. We're going to take him into our custody. Is this really necessary? Until we have a clear understanding of the effect of his actions, yes. Where's Ben? - Overseeing patients. - We should go. You're not going anywhere. Lawrence! Tom! Look out! Run! Look out! Tom! Tom, are you okay? Tom. Tom, are you okay? He's dead. I killed him. Who is he? Eric Bell. We think he was taken. I mean... he killed his wife. He-he wrote Noah Arnold Moore everywhere. We looked it up, but... But Noah Arnold Moore is dead. Go to his house. His... his wife is... Let me see. Are you okay? Yeah? You could have got yourself killed calling out like that. Yeah, but I didn't. You're shaking. Yeah, it's been a day. Could use a drink. I love you. You really do, don't you? Oy, she needs help. She's been hurt. You all right? It's not working. What? Whatever's in there just absorbed the content. Just ate it. Warning. Corruption. Warning. Corruption. Warning. Corruption. If Noah Arnold Moore is dead and Francois Thomas is dead, then they're all dead. Who are these people, Lawrence? These takers, they're ghosts. Meredith, it was me. This is all my... Lawrence. No! Help! Somebody, please! Help! Somebody help, please! Dad? Tom. Tom. Hawking... Seven. Lawrence. No! This is Claire Leabridge reporting live from the Hub, where Lawrence Hatfield has just been attacked and stabbed several times. I repeat, Lawrence Hatfield has just been stabbed. What? What is it? What are you seeing? What... What do you see?
