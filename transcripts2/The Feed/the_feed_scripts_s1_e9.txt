 Share your life. Your memories, mundles, are safe forever. A virus is coming though the Feed. It appears as a spasm while you sleep. Do not sleep alone. Watch each other. Stay vigilant, but above all else, remain calm, and do not tamper with your Feed. Remain calm... Do not tamper... Remain calm... Do not tamp... Remain c... Do not... Remain... Do not... Meredith Hatfield is a liar. Do not remove it?

 No need for panic? Even when the Feed is literally killing you while you sleep? This was my wife last night. Margaret! Margaret, wake up! Margaret, you just had a spasm. Are you okay? Sh-Should I call someone? Margaret! Margaret! It's kill or be killed. What the fuck? He just killed his wife. - She was trying to kill him. - That's what they think happened to Cass. - That she's got that virus. - There's no fucking virus. They're saying Hatfield cracked. Then what the fuck did we just see? They're not gonna hurt Cass, are they? No. What? No. Don't do anything stupid, Kate. We're too high up. It's okay. It's okay. No service. We apologize for any inconvenience. Look, I don't want you to put your baby - or yourself in harm's way. - Then let us go! I can't do that! You know I can't do that! Shit. Shit. Don't go through the window, Kate. - I just want to talk. - You got a funny fucking way of showing it! You attacked me, remember? I never wanted it to be like this. Where is she? Where's my sister? Oh, Kate. I know what it's like to lose someone. And now my family, the ones like me, are in danger. So that's why I need your help. I need you to track Tom and tell me where he is! Go to hell. Evelyn! Evelyn! Fuck. Help! Help me! Help! Evelyn! Their numbers are increasing. And if it comes out that Meredith was right and we kept all this secret, - it's our heads. - How soon until we run out of space? We're already holding multiples in single cages. - Have you found Meredith yet? - No. Any ideas? Why have you called me in? We have staff trying to roll back the Feed's operating system, reducing us to the most basic network. We're trying to see if the takers will still be able to come through. Right now, we're just trying to target remote areas outside the city, where its infrastructure won't affect the daily balance, but the Feed keeps crashing. We can't stabilize its operating system. We need your help. The takers' numbers are escalating. We're running out of space. - Well, what happens when you do? - That's what we're afraid of. America, Russia and China are already discussing systematic removal. If they keep coming, and we can't save them... Then what? Then you'll kill them? They murdered my men. They tried to kill you. If it comes down to us or them... We're hoping to avoid that. Evelyn? Our genomic sequencing code, plus multiple cures for metabolic disease. Well, that's wonderful. Thank you, Meredith, for your sudden consideration for my people's health. It's just the beginning of what I can offer. I have a proposition. In exchange for my family's asylum. When we started the Feed, we put our competitors out of business by buying up their patents. These contain the base codes for networks that could rival the Feed. I will help you build one. And put your own company out of business? It's already dead. But we need an alternative. Why don't you let it die altogether? Because it's holding up our global infrastructure. Electricity, banking, information, all runs off the Feed. Without it, society collapses. Your society. Support me in creating a network that everyone will want, and you will become the most powerful man in the world. I need to consider your proposition. Until then, my sister Sen will show you to your accommodation. Sen and her guards will be by your side all the time. - Well, that won't be necessary. - I'm afraid it is. Someone needs to watch you sleep. In case you get infected with the virus and spread your illness here. What the hell was he doing down here? Who knows what was going on in his head? Where do we start? We can't even activate the lights. It's here. Whatever it is, we find it. We end it now. We should contact Mum. She'll be able to make sense of this. We can't. She's gone. She's left the country. You serious? - She tried to tell you, Ben. - Uh-huh. She went to find us a safe place. - She wouldn't just leave you. - Well, why not? - Everyone else does. - Do we really have to do this now? I'm just kidding, Tom. The last time I saw her, she was very kind. Look, it's just important that we focus... Of course. The magic touch. I've called the police. They're on their way. Well, that was a fucking stupid thing to do. What now? You kill me? Just find out where your husband is. Why? So more of you can come through? You take other people's lives? My sister had kids! She had a fucking family! I had a child. Three years old when I died. She'd be eight now. Don't you think I'd give anything to see her again? But she'd just look at me the way you are now, like I'm a monster. Like... I don't belong. You take my sister's body and wear her like some fucking parasite! Fuck you. You know, Lawrence said we'd have a chance at a new beginning. That we might get to live again. Lawrence did this? He-he... he made it so that you could come through? You know, maybe you should call Tom. Tell him that. Maybe it would help him find what he's looking for. I am not calling him, you fucking lunatic! - Then maybe I'll give you a reason to. - No... That was fast for the cops. You want everyone to stay safe, then you stay fucking quiet! Martha! Martha, no! Fuck. Fuck! Naz. No... Hey. - I'm Martha. - Naz, hey. Where's Kate? Oh, uh, she's back in the house trying to get Bea to sleep, so... Right, right. - Is this all for us? - Yeah. Tia said you'd be staying for a bit. Sorry I couldn't get here earlier. Oh, no worries. Uh... Should I give you a hand? Yeah, cool. Hey. Jonah. It's me, Danny. Um... can we come up? Danny? Hey. Uh... Look, I'm... sorry for spraying your image. We were idiots. We get it now. But we need your help. I didn't know where else to go. Try the Feed. Please. Our friend's in trouble. She got arrested by the police. But when we went to bail her out, - they wouldn't tell us where she was. - Why? They think she's one of those... the sleepy twitcher things. Is she? So why would they think that? We fucked up. We sprayed a video of her pretending to spasm. - W-We thought it was a joke. - But we're learning it's not. Come in. So how does it work? Fingerprint? DNA? Considering Dad's obsession with lineage, I wouldn't be surprised. We need to find the main controls. He really did love you. And you've no recollection of being here? If I was ever here, I-I was too young to remember. He probably erased those mundles, too. Yeah, well, at least you have a clear storage. No... fucked-up memories to keep you up at night. It's not much better, Ben. Well, that's where I have to disagree with you Tom, because... it is the memories that... I mean, you feel like you've dealt with everything. That you've fixed things. And you let your mind rest for a second. It's the memories that catch you off guard. Turn everything dark in an instant. What memories, Ben? - Huh? - Just the same old bullshit that everyone else has got, I guess. Well, why don't you just delete your mundles? But I still remember, Tom. Well, you can't just keep replaying them over and over again, torturing yourself. I-I can't. I can't forget how hated I am because... What if I just want what you've got? Muscle out a place for me and a family and if it happens again, if people decide I'm not good enough again... I want to see that coming. Because I can't be rejected anymore. Ben. You can be better than you think you are. - You really don't know me at all. - Oh, shut up. Tom, no... Good evening, Mr. Hatfield. My name is Alba. How may I help you? Thanks. I'm up to 12 minutes off. You don't have to prove anything, Danny. Right, what do you lot want with me, anyway? We thought maybe, because of who you hang with, you might have heard rumblings about where they're taking the twitchers to. Why? What you thinking? We were hoping maybe you could set us up - with some Resisters. - You? Do you think any Resister's really want to gonna help you break into the Hub? The Hub? For real? - I can get us in. - Yeah. -No, he can. - His shrink's a Hatfield. - Yeah. That Hatfield who don't like being a Hatfield. He's like you. - Preachy. - He's not preachy. He's right. You and Tom would like each other. On the same page, like old folk would say. But seriously. You were right. All right, just call your friend. Don't want you doing anything stupid. Slow signal. We apologize for any disruptions. - It's slow. - Mad slow. I can barely chat to my girls. That's 'cause there are no girls. I think they're keeping it slow to stop the virus. Or bury that kooky Hatfield message. Maybe Tom's at the Hub. - Hey, we should just go there. - No, you just said yourself. The Feed is being weird. If Meredith fucking Hatfield is saying it's a problem, there's some serious shit going down. But what's the worst that could happen? What? They tell us to fuck off? Yeah, they had me locked up there for a week. And I hadn't done anything. Dan... it's Cass. We owe her. I hope my family... enjoy your country. Especially my son, Tom. He has a baby girl. Is it a good place to bring up children? I'm sorry about your mother's passing. I've recently suffered a bereavement myself. Your mother was a clever lady. She realized your potential for leadership. My brother's the one in power. Not if you depose him. I know you've been working with a resistance group to expose your brother's lies. You hate him much more than I do. You don't hate him. You're helping him to save yourself. Yes. But with the Feed compromised, someone else will build him a network if I don't. And your brother will become an even bigger tyrant than he already is. How may I help you? Are you my father's assistant? My objective is to make life easier. So, that's a yes? Yes. Well, you could've just said that. That would've made things easier. Do you have access to all of his files? Can you pull up Hawking 7-2? 299 results found. Hawking 7-2-1-0-0 to 7-2-3-9-9. What are they? Hawking 7-2-1-0-0, thought unification modulator. Hawking 7-2-1-0-1, fetal intelligence monitoring. Hawking 7-2-1-0-2, AI soldier simulation. Hawking 7-2-1-0-3, genetic replacement therapy. Hawking 7-2-1-0-4, neurological redistribution meter. Hawking 7-2-1-0-5, - synapse conduction testing... - Tom, this is gonna take for fucking ever. - 7-2-1... - Do any of these files store people, uh... mundles, thoughts, consciousness, anything like that? - 73. - Pull those up. 72 presented. Hawking 7-2-1-9-7, corrupted. How? You found it. Alba, what was the file? Original participants in our SAVEYOU Beta study. What was the study? Who were the subjects? A medical trial on consciousness manipulation. Subjects were deceased persons who donated their Feeds for research. Consciousness manipulation? What are you talking about? SAVEYOU's just an enhanced memory storage. The program goes beyond mundles. It stores thoughts, emotions. Every experience the user has. It stores their essence. Dad was storing people's lives. What exactly did he do to them, Alba? Mathematical reasoning enhanced within ten percent of safe zone. Cognitive empathy diminished within 12% of... He was manipulating the consciousness of dead people? - Correct. - For how many? 15,000 in SAVEYOU Beta. Before memory increase. 15,000? Well, that's fine. - We-we can deal with that. - Memory increase, Alba. Wh-What exactly do you mean by memory increase? Original participants totaled 15,000. Memory has since increased to 4.739 million. That's 4.7 million? Correct. Worldwide. Lawrence made that many? No. They continued the study themselves. Wait... They continued themselves? Correct. - They made more of themselves? - Correct. - Currently in process. - They're doing it right now? - Correct. - Stop saying "correct." How, how could they do this? They learned watching Lawrence. Can you delete them? Negative. File corrupted. We need Evelyn. Okay. Okay. Oh. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Shit, shit. I'll help you unload them. Oh... no, that's okay. I'll do it. We're really tired, so... Looks nasty. Is it...? Oh. Yeah. I, uh... I got spooked by a stuffed squirrel in there. Fell down the stairs. This house it nuts, innit? Let me have a look. Oh, no, no. Uh, Kate'll patch it up - when Bea's asleep. - I've got a kit right here. Really, you don't have to. Look, we're really tired. I've got this huge headache, and... you know, thank you so much for your help, but we're good. - Really. - All right, well, - be back in a couple of days to check on you, then? - That'd be great. Go. G-Go. Good night. Martha? Martha? Are you all right? Has something happened? Did Kate do that? You think Kate has turned? Oh, God. Naz. Naz, run. Get out of here! - Naz, run! - Look, hold on a second. Naz, no! No... you stay back. Okay. Help! Martha's been taken! No signal. We apologize for any inconvenience. Unable to modify SAVEYOU base code. File corrupted. Ask her what the corruption is. Alba, what's the corruption? Corruption derives from the subjects' self-encryption. They've protected themselves. Encryption? Is that why their Feeds are being blocked? - Probably. - Can you delete them? Um... if I can break the encryption. Ask her if she can transfer the file. Alba, did you hear Evelyn? Can you transfer the SAVEYOU file? Downloading to Feed. I'll let you know what I find. Ev, h-have you heard anything from Martha? No, I've been trying. I-I was hoping you had. Service is slow outside the city. We've gone back to basic, so it keeps dipping in and out. I'm hoping we just can't get through. Just... Finally. I've been trying to get through to you all night. What are you...? Where the frig are you? Hey, hi. - Danny, Danny, what's wrong? - Uh... my friend's in the Hub because of something stupid we've done. I mean, they think she's one of those things, but she's not. - I swear it was a joke. - Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What? She pretended to-to have a fit online, And they assumed she's one of the-the taken. How has she ended up in the Hub? They've taken her from her house. They put her in the back of a van... Now she's in the Hub, we need to get her out. How did she get in the Hub? They arrested her! They took her in the van... Can you get us in? - Into the Hub? - Yeah. No, no way. It's not safe there. Okay, you're gonna go home. I-I'll handle this, all right? What's her name? - Cass Stewart. - Cass? - Cassandra. - Cassandra. Okay. I'll ping it down, Tom. Get someone to take a look. Thank you. Hey. I'm gonna deal with this. You're gonna go home, you're gonna stay home, yes? Yes, Danny? Okay. Tom, Martha's been taken. Tom, we need your help. - Fuck. - What? - Shit, shit, shit. - Tom. Are we in? Nah. He ain't there. He said he'll handle it. Right, well, then, he'll handle it. Fuck. Danny, we should just think about this. Hey, she's one of us, man. Tom. Due to compromises in the Feed network, the police emergency line is currently unavailable. Tom! Tom. Wh-Wh-What's happened? What's going on? Kate and Bea are in trouble. - Martha's been taken. - Well, then, call the police. I've tried! The Feed's slow and Kate's in the middle of fucking nowhere. Wait. - Key. Give me, give me the key. - Tom... - What? Give me the key! - We can't just leave. No, you don't understand. This is my family. This is... This is all I have. Just give me the fucking key. Well, I'm coming with you. I... I-I can't lose them, okay? I can't. I know. No... Okay. Okay, you get in. You're okay. You're okay. There we go. Okay. You be quiet. Come on. Come on. It's your sister, Kate. If you have any hope of getting her back, don't hurt her. Oh, God. No. No. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, baby. It's okay. No. No, oh, God. - Be quiet! Shut up! Shut up! - No! I don't want to! - No! - Move it out. Quickly. - - That's it... - Get it moving. Right. You two, over there. Get going, move it on. Hey, let's leave it, man. - This is intense. - Yeah, he's right, Danny. Your friend said he'd handle it. Tom's busy with other shit. What if they're hurting Cass - and he doesn't get to her in time, huh? - This is bait, Danny. We're so gonna end up in one of them vans ourselves. Yeah. - That's the idea. - What? No. No fucking way. - What? - Look, they locked me up there for a week. Who knows what the fuck they're doing to them. That's what I'm trying to find out. W... y-you survived. Yeah, and it wasn't fucking funny, Danny. I'm having no part in this. - Part of what? - Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. She'd do the same for me, Jonah. Come on! Let's wrap it up! - Danny... - It's me you're talking to. I'm like a cat, the way I land on my feet. Come on. Hit me. Seriously, what the fuck is going on? - Help! Help, quick! - Ping the Hub. Please! Please help, quick! Uh, my friend... He's my friend. I-I mean, he was my friend. - I don't know who he is anymore. - What's going on? He just went for us, out of nowhere. Well, it was fine one minute, and the next, punched him. - Are you hurt? - No, I'm fine. I mean, I had to take control, hard. I'm not proud. You did the right thing. We'll take care of him. Move on! With Hau eliminated, well, you can assume military control. And when enablement starts, you can monitor your officers. Make sure no one plots against you in return. So I can become as paranoid as Quan? If I was planning something, you're threatening it. I don't have full military support. You will if you build them a network. But the people don't want it. Our country survives on off-line tourism. Which will end if we don't give them an alternative to the Feed. You can free your people, Sen. Do you know what Quan does to traitors? You're getting along. The hard drives you gave me were encrypted. Of course they are. You can't open them without me. - Yes, but once we have... - You won't be able to enable the codes without me, either. Did you really think I'd come here unprepared? You can't trust her regardless. She's been telling me all the ways I should kill you. My sister has a very dark sense of humor. I can never tell when she's telling the truth. Is she? Of course she is. Leave us. Get out. Let's go. Move. Move on. Move. Oi. You... Next. Next one. Kate! Kate! Kate. Okay, okay... Bea... Bea! Bea. Hey, hey. Hey, it's okay. It's okay. There we go. Come here, baby. Come here, baby. Come on. Here. Take her. Okay, take her. Okay. Shh, shh. Where is she? I know what you are. What have you done with my wife? Tom. Just go. I'll stay with Bea. - Yeah? - Okay. Okay, I have to make myself absolutely clear. Only the authorized personnel present in the meeting room... It's not working. Keep trying. Oh... I've had to restart three times now. What's happening? It's the SAVEYOU encryption. It keeps locking us out. It's protecting itself. It's outsmarting us. - So how do we get rid of it? - With time. Or insight. Well, we don't have time, so what the fuck do you mean by insight? You're holding hundreds of people who know how this works. Who literally built this encryption. Get one of them to talk. Kate! Kate! So, you're Ben Hatfield? You don't need to worry about who I am. No one ever does, I guess. You know, I know all about you. Alba's got all kinds of secrets stored in her. You've seen them all, have you? We've seen a lot of things. Well, that's over now. We know it was SAVEYOU. Our programmers are at the Hub deleting it as we speak. Good luck. What? Why would we allow the tech that supports us to be deleted, when tech is literally our greatest strength? Cass. Cass. Cass. I said move! Hey, I'm looking for my friend. What the hell are you doing here? Eh? This kid shouldn't be here! - No talking! - He's not one of us! He is not one of us! Cass? I said no fucking talking! Cass? Open the door. Open the door! Cass? Cass. Cass. Cass, you need to wake up. It's me. It's Danny. - Danny? - Yeah. Danny. What have they done to you? Fuck, fuck, fuck! Kate! You know, AI lacks humanity. It's flawed, robotic, and serves absolutely no purpose other than to serve humans, which automatically makes it inferior. And the fact that it will still go on to exist beyond us, serving nothing and no one, is the biggest travesty of all. Your father couldn't stomach it, so he created a solution. You? We're here to save you from yourselves. If you're here to save us, then why kill us? Dmitri Garin? My dad? When we first started coming, the transition was disorienting. Sara was aiming for Lawrence at your wedding. You were a mistake. Oh, so I don't even make the kill list. You aren't a threat. You're not important. But you could be. We know it's SAVEYOU. It's only a matter of time... before the rest of your kind... are deleted. It's inevitable. You will not win. But with your help, we can make better arrangements for all of you. Who will give us the codes? Kate! Kate! Kate! Thank God. I love you. It's okay. I'm so, so sorry. Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God. - Oh, thank God. - She attacked me. - It's okay now. It's okay. - Oh, God. - Where's Bea? - She's fine. - Where is she? - She's back there with Ben. Okay, she's good. She's okay, yeah? Let's get you out of here, all right? - Yeah. - Come on. - Get your arm over. - Oh, God. Come on, baby. There we go. There we go, come on. Come on. - Get me to my baby, please. - Okay. Do you know where Lawrence made us? That's where he was experimenting on Tom, too. When I was stuck inside that void with Alba, I could see everything. I know what Lawrence did. Tom? Tom, Bea... Don't you ever wonder why Tom is more intelligent? More together? Why he's so good? Why does Tom seem to have everything while you... you have nothing? You know, I can change that, Ben. I can show you what Lawrence did. I can give you access to his memories, his thoughts, his research. I can make you someone your father would be proud of. And why would you do that? Just get me to Alba, and I can help us both. We just need your father's DNA. Tom's would work, or... you have a little piece of him here. Anyone change their mind? Cass? I'll help. Pull him out. Stop him! Kill them! Kill them all! Cass! Cass... Ben? Ben... Tom? Tom, where's Bea? Ben!
