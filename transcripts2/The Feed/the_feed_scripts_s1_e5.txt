 Share your life. Your memories, mundles, are safe forever. How you doing, Kate? Just pressure, no pain. Good. Being awake during surgery can get disorientating. I'm fine. Please just... keep going. - Okay. - What the fuck? What did you see? Tom, what did you see? Someone else. Some-Some-Someone else entirely. T-There was a-a man in there. Sara's Feed is gone.

 It was just him. L-Let me out. Let me out. Just check my mundles. Get me out of here. I need to go. Kate, start without me if you have to. I'm-I'm coming. I'll be there soon. Just get that thing out of your head. Good morning, Ben. Sweet dreams? Wh-What the hell? Danny? Danny, go back on. You was just in hospital for going off too long. J-Just wanted to see if I can. Oh-ho-ho! Danny's back. You're not too good for us anymore, huh? - The Resister throw you out? - Did he show you his scar? I told you, he's not with them anymore. Well, don't tell my followers. Got me a hella bank for spraying a Resister. - You sprayed him? - Yeah. Got to give the people what they want. What the fuck you do that for? I told you he wasn't a Resister. So? If he ain't a Resister, he's got nothing to worry about, but if he is... He's fucked! Dan! Hey, where are you going? Hey. I'm here, Kate. I'm here. Kate, name a word beginning with "M." Martha. Who's Martha? My sister. And where does Martha live? Kate, where does Martha live? D... Detroit. - That was a hesitation. - No. No, wait. That wasn't a... hesi... tation. I was thinking about my family. This thing you're taking out, it, uh... - It keeps us close. - Everything... Hey. Everything she said is true. If it's safe, please just keep going. I shouldn't have left, right? What if it comes back? Then we'll download SAVEYOU again, and again. Look, whatever it takes. We know how to fix it now. - You can help us stop it. - How? That thing was inside your head, so maybe in time, you'll remember what it was. I remember what it felt like. The way it seeped in. It just went dark. It was like I didn't exist. I was, I was dead, Evie. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. Right now we need to focus on us, okay? On new memories. We restored what we could. Go through it. It'll make you feel more you. Yeah. There's too much missing. My memories... are in here. You can remember on your own. If you say so. What do you remember? You. The only memories I saved were of you, Evie. You're the only thing worth keeping. You don't need to watch us. I'm fine. Mr. Hatfield says we watch until we're sure. Gil... I don't want to do this. Kate, what color is grass? Green. What's your daughter's name? Beatrice. Kate, can you wriggle your toes? Kate, wriggle your toes. I am. - Come on. - Kate... Kate, what's your daughter's name? Kate, tell me your daughter's name. I, uh... Wait, uh... No, no, no, no, no. Stop. Hey. - Hey, hey! Stop, stop. - No. He's right, Kate. The damage to your brain could be irreparable. Bea. My daughter, she's, uh... It's too late, Kate. - Bea. - It's okay. She's fine. She's with Jane. Jane's taking care of her. No, no, if you... you can't get it out of me... get it out of... her. Delete app. Corruption. Deletion not possible. Natalie, I'm not coming in today. Gil Tomine is requesting a connection. Ben, it's Gil. - Are you free? - Yes. - Ben. - What do you want? We need to talk, about Miyu. Are you okay? Fuck off, Gil. Nah, Ben's probably home, hungover. Too much whiskey and wanking to his ex. I should send him flowers from her, give him some hope. You're a coder, Natalie; like, a legit genius. - You need to complain. - To who? His name's on the building. You've been off. Working from home. - Is everything all right? - I'm fine. Just going slow. You don't do slow. With everything that's been happening recently, I haven't been that keen to be on. You would tell me if something was wrong? When was the last time that things were right? Tea? Turn on your Feed. Why? We're rolling out a new beta security patch. Just for family. Good luck selling that to Tom. He's a father now. He'll understand. - What's the patch? - It links your location with our security teams. Monitors vitals, adrenal spikes. You need to be on so I can upload it. Ben, I'm making sure you're safe. Turn on your Feed. Have you found us somewhere safe? Somewhere secure? Ben? Yes. Uh, the-the, the Island of Santa Maria. It's still off. Or there's the C.O.M.? - You are kidding. - It's got everything else. There are only so many options, Mum. Hmm. I thought I should brush up on the fundamentals, given the situation. - It's outdated. - It's from uni days. You sure everything's all right? I'm fine. So sorry. - Who are you looking for? - W-What? Well, you don't live here, so who are you looking for? Jonah. I-I'll go right up. He's gone. Police raid. They took a load of people in for questioning. I don't know when he'll be back. If he'll be back. We just need to have a little look to pinpoint the transmitter's position on the cervical vertebrae. Hold on a moment. When was she enabled? We don't know exactly. Has it been functioning correctly? Yeah. I mean, you know, we don't... And when was the last time you connected with her? This morning. This doesn't make any sense. What doesn't make any sense? What's wrong? I can't remove her transmitter. She doesn't have one. Mum, what are you and Dad doing for dinner? We need to talk. Smells delicious, Mum. You've been slaving away all day. Tom's finally asked for a family dinner. Try to enjoy it. Oh, I am. I think it's wonderful that he and Dad are now thick as thieves. What Tom saw in Sara's Feed has been very useful. Well, three cheers for Tom. We're close now, Ben. We can find out who has made us vulnerable and plug the leak. Close? Your father found something called a Ghost App in Sara's Feed. It's highly illegal. And he only saw it because he finally got to her chip. So? So, these apps spy on their users and leak information. In the wrong head, they could provide access to the server. We're scanning employees to see if anyone has one. Everyone? Uh, which apps? Oh, you wouldn't know them. Um, MindSpy, um, SnuffRoom. VirtualCompanion. Vile. Um, h-how long until you run the algorithm? Uh, w-what can I do? Nothing. Relax. The results won't be in until the morning. No, but I-I can help, Mum. They're here. No. M-Mum. Go and get your father. Tom's here. Really? Quick, kill the fatted calf. Tell your mother I'll be there in a moment. You know he hates us, right? - He hates you. - Right. - Would you care if I hated you? - Do you? Because it's not a competition, Ben. No, it's not, because I've given everything to you. To this company, to this family. I gave you a senior position, considerable salary. - What more do you want? - I'd settle for your respect. Ah, well, there you go. That's the thing about respect. Once you have to ask for it, you've already lost it. Mum's waiting. Who'd like a drink? I have a bottle of Montrachet I've been saving - for a special occasion. - Don't open it on our account. - Can I get a glass of water? - Is everything all right? Fine. Well, we're staying off tonight. - No distractions. - Where's Dad? - Working. - I told him to rest. - He hasn't slept in days. - Does he ever? Didn't you know? The less our father dreams, the bigger stake he has in reality. Business Insider. Forbes. You don't know how to rest either, do you, sweetie? She's so beautiful. Our little miracle. Do you need anything? Max? Why are you sneaking around? - Just checking you're okay. - Yeah? You want to ask me a question to make sure? Shut up. Can I ask you a question? - Why? You think I'm not me? - No, I know it's you. It's just... It's not that kind of question. At the farm, I kept waiting for the right time. I don't want to wait anymore. I nearly died. And at the back of my mind, all I kept thinking was, "You bloody moron." Mm... "You never asked her to marry you." Uh, um, is-is this okay? Yeah? - Ow! - Oh, God. Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Oh, it's okay. It's worth it. Come here. - You good? - Mm-hmm. Gil, can we talk? I'm still outside. If there's any trouble, she'll let me know. We need eyes on him. That was the arrangement. She knows the risks. Still went off. Obviously, she's not worried. Are you? He's traumatized. Damn near lost his mind, but... he knows who he is. I can see that. - Do you want me to go in? - No, I'll have a look. Lawrence? What are you gonna do with those? Hey. I-I've been trying to reach you a few days now. You okay? No. You shouldn't have come here. It's not safe. I'm safe. Can I...? Look... Danny, you're sweet... and I thought we'd had a good time, but I just spent my week getting interrogated by ICSA, because you or one of your mates sprayed my picture. I-I... I didn't. This isn't a game... Danny. You don't understand the severity of what's going on around here, because you're young. And you're an addict. Addicts only care about one thing: themselves. Marcus, you fucking prick! Look at you, you can't even look me in the eye, - not really. - N-No, no, no. I-I can. I-I can. Just... go home, Danny. Look after yourself. Are you missing work yet, Kate? No, not really. That's good. I remember finding it difficult to adjust, at first. Well, motherhood hasn't exactly been the tedium I was promised. I remember when Tom was born. I wore the same sweater for months, didn't I, Lawrence? Lawrence. Maybe you could spare us one meal, or is that too much to ask? No, not at all. I'll spray a request for no one to hack us for the next few hours since we're having a charming family dinner. So, Tom, take it you've heard about the latest security update? What update? Oh, I thought you told him. I thought she'd told you. You will have a detail following you, just in case, and we'll need to install a software patch, so our security team can monitor you. And if we don't want it, you're just gonna upload it anyway? - No, of course not. - Why not? It wouldn't be the first time you uploaded something we didn't want. Oh, wow. Is Bea enabled? Fuck me. How did you pull that one off? I mean, how do you put a transmitter into someone's fetus without them even realizing? Honestly, Dad, - I'm impressed. - Ben. Shut up. Kate? Kate, for God's sake, what have you done? Relax, relax, it's still there. Doctor said it's too far gone. - Bea, on the other hand... - Oh, well, you take it out of her, you're gonna fuck her up for life. Tom. What the hell is wrong with you? - Are you insane? - What does it matter? We couldn't take it out because there's nothing in there. - Well, Kate just said... - We scanned her, every inch, every possible place it could be. That's impossible. That's what I thought, Ben, but then if anyone knows how to explain the impossible, it's our dad. This isn't really the way I wanted to have this conversation. Oh, really? Did you ever want to have this conversation? Please tell me what you did to our little girl. Nothing. I didn't do anything to Beatrice. You gave her the Feed. No, I didn't. Tom did. She inherited it from you. Polymeric conductors. Your in-ute chip was carbon-based, and as you developed in the womb, it imprinted on your DNA. I made it genetic. Oh, my God. Genetic? Do I have it? You infected me? It's not an infection. - It's a... - Don't you dare say it. It's an enhancement. Did you know? Yes. Yeah. How... how did you even know it would work? What if she got sick? W-W-What if her body rejected it? She couldn't possibly reject it, it's been a part of her DNA from the moment she was conceived. So we can't take it out, ever? You don't need to. I would never have embarked upon this had I not been 100% certain of success. She was never in any danger, I made sure of that. What happens now? What happens? What happens if she gets taken? She's a baby. Oh, you arrogant son of a bitch! That's what you were doing inside my head, wasn't it? You were keeping an eye on your science experiment. I needed to check on her. Jesus Christ. She's not a science experiment, Kate. She's progress. Why? To see if he could. No. Why you? Why did he give it to you? Why not me? Yeah? No, no, no, no, no, no. Let's-let's do this after they go home. Okay. But I'd like to talk to Kate alone, please. It's okay. There we go. Before you say anything, make your apologies, lack thereof, whatever, I want something. Get Tia Holcombe out of lockup. She's a Resister, but she hasn't done anything. Not what you're saying, anyway. Right. Well, I'll see what I can do. Then you can say what you have to say. Well, um... she's my granddaughter. Of course she's not a science experiment. She's my flesh and blood. That always comes first. I-I know - you don't believe me. - I don't. Kate, you and I don't know each other as well as we should. I'm perfectly aware of that. You think I'm cold. You think I don't care about other people. But you're mistaken. Other people are all I ever think about. The world needs the Feed, and your daughter is part of something incredible. Something utterly profound. She's going to change everything. You had no right to make that decision for her or us. Well, maybe not. But the reality is I made that choice before even you were born. And I don't expect you to understand, but I really need you to know that it was always for her. And for her children and for their children. Would you like me to show you? That I love Beatrice? That I did this for her? Would you like me to show you? What exactly? What was going on inside my head when I was in yours. Sit beside me. Such a beautiful n-n-night. It is, isn't it? You're sad today. No. I'm not sad. How the fuck do I get rid of you? Oh, B-B-Ben. Send to Gil Tomine. One day, we'll go away toge-together. Wh-Where are we going? Corruption. Function not possible. Do you wish to copy? Yes. Send anonymously. Without notification. I've been selfish, Miyu. I've been keeping you all to myself. It's time to share you. I love you, Ben. I love you, too. But so does Gil. And he deserves you. I ordered a cab. Yeah, I'll be right behind you. Stay as long as you need. I'll be fine. You know, the scariest thing is is that he genuinely thinks he's doing the right thing. Deep down, there's not an ounce of regret. How do you know that? He showed me. I saw it through his eyes. I... I felt it. Paternal, compassionate love. - But? - I don't know. I-It was creepy. Like... Like, I know him now. Like... Like, maybe this is how he feels about the whole world. That... that love, that... that compassion. Like, he sees human beings like his children, and he thinks he has the right to control them. Tom. As your mother, I only ever wanted to protect you. Tell me how it works. - Well, I can send you a detailed explanation... - No, no, no, no, no, I want you to tell me, to understand how you see it. I want to understand you, Dad. Well... Beatrice's Feed is safer, more natural, a thousand times more reliable than anyone else's. There is no inorganic material inside her body. It's part of her brain. That was the experiment. The one that made me sick? I had to make it work in you to make it for everyone. Now just imagine, no manufacturing. No production costs. Imagine if people didn't have to pay for this. We're about to redistribute economic power. About to? Thousands of people have been enabled in-ute... Tom, with no reported problems. So... this is... out there? Not just in me, not just in Bea? It's, it's out there. Everyone enabled in-ute in the past few years carries the gene. They'll pass it to their children. It's their biological right. And they won't be able to remove it. No. What about their right to choose? Choice. Don't people deserve choice? So corporate interests can oppress them? Keep people paying, empower economic inequality? I think in the light of everything we've accomplished, the question of choice is-is immaterial. Do you think everyone will feel that way? Well, no, not everyone. Cer... Certainly not my... investors. People are in danger. What is happening to their Feeds is-is-is destroying them. When they figure this out, you think they'll be happy with what you've done? I think, at the end of the day, people want progress. What about freedom? What about it? Oh, people cling to this idea of freedom. It doesn't... lead to unity. Freedom breeds chaos. You're not the singular answer to chaos. People are... unruly. Are they not? Unpredictable. Self-destructive. If we are to survive as a species, we all need to follow the same path. And you get to decide where that leads? You're not God. Look, Tom, there are people in this world who devote their entire lives to playing chess. They expend every ounce of their intellect moving small wooden figures around a grid to beat their opponent, to prove they're the best. Now, if I wanted to prove I was the best, I'd become a grand master, but how would that benefit anyone? Where would the world be if Edison had been a chess player? Or Marconi? I didn't do this for me. I didn't do this for my ego. I did it because it would have been selfish not to. Because you had to get there first? Because I needed to protect it. You think I'm the only one who sees the world for what it is? You've got no idea what people are capable of. This technology is saving us. In the wrong hands, it could just as easily tear us apart. So, of course, it had to be me. And you're all lucky I got there first. And you're all lucky I took control. But you're not in control. People are being taken. We're all in danger. For 9.2 seconds, it all went down, and the whole world saw. Well... what can I say? People have short memories. No. Not anymore. You made sure of that. You've been off all day. Lawrence is gonna kill you. What if he's trying to reach you? Life goes on? Have you kept me up so long 'cause you're afraid to go to sleep? Are you complaining? No. - Mm. - What? Wait. Where you... where you going? - To the loo! - What?! You know you're gonna have to sleep eventually? I will sleep when I'm dead, thanks. Mm. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry I'm... here. You know, that it's... it's-it's late. I just... So, I'm on the edge of my seat. Yeah. Uh... My father is not fit to run the Feed anymore. You need to take it from him. I have my own reasons for wanting that, but what are yours? Narcissistic personality disorder. If I could demote people for that alone, I'd run every company in London. He's playing with people's lives in-in more ways than one. You... You need to stop him before anyone else gets hurt. I can't explain what's happening, but neither can he. I can't take anything away from your father without a bank vault of evidence. He's too powerful. He has too many friends. He's too... beloved. Thank you. Ready to broadcast? Do you wish to proceed? Proceed. Everyone enabled in-ute in the past few years carries the gene. They'll pass it to their children. It's their biological right. I think in the light of everything we've accomplished, the question of choice is immaterial. Oh, people cling to this idea of freedom. It doesn't lead to unity. Freedom breeds chaos. People are unruly. They're unpredictable, they're self-destructive. I think, at the end of the day, what people want is progress. You think I'm the only one who sees the world for what it is? You've got no idea what people are capable of. This technology is saving us, but in the wrong hands, it could just as easily tear us apart. So, of course, it had to be me. Oh, people cling to this idea of freedom. It doesn't lead to unity. Freedom breeds chaos. Everyone enabled in-ute in the past few years carries the gene. They'll pass it to their children. I didn't do this for me, I didn't do this for my ego. I did it because it would have been selfish not to. 'Cause I needed to protect it. It's immaterial. - Did you see that? - Do you hear it? Look, look, people are unruly. They're unpredictable. They're self-destructive. If we're to survive as a species, we all need to follow the same path. Fuck. Do you know what you've just done? Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for being here. After a long discussion with our board, it has been decided that Lawrence Hatfield will step down from his duties at the Feed effective immediately. Are you happy now? Are you... pleased with all you've done? I was trying to help you. You're trying to help, because you destroyed everything. Your sense of entitlement was a danger to everything, t-to everyone. You think that you can just sit in your tower and solve the world's issues on your own... I have spent 40 years building this, and you have turned it all to dust in 40 fucking seconds! You didn't give me a choice. I could expect it of a rival or a Resister, but Jesus Christ, you're my son! Everything I've ever done, I have done for you, and I've done it from a position of complete love! Bullshit! You have no idea what love is. None! You-you-you-you-you-you... you spread, you-you force-feed this myth of connectivity. You can't connect to anyone! Not your wife, not your children! I don't have children. Great. - Fine by me. - No, no. Your mother... has children. I have a child. What does that mean? You've always been my clever boy, Tom, haven't you? Why don't you work that one out? Thank you for your continued commitment to the Feed. Your support at this difficult time is much appreciated. Amanda Javad, head of our American hub, and myself will take over his responsibilities until a more permanent solution is agreed upon. I know our brightest and most innovative days are still ahead of us. Thank you.
