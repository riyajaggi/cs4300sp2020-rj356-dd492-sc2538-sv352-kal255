 Share your life. Your memories, mundles, are safe forever. You're Natalie. Right? You know where it is. What? Where we came from. You know where it is, don't you? Please, tell me you know. Yeah, I do. Please, just don't hurt me. You're lying. I'm not.

 Please, I can tell you. You're just trying to protect yourself. It's okay. I'd do the same in your condition. How far along are you? Five... Do you have any kids? Lucy. She... Her name was Lucy. I'm going to leave now. You made it. You slept for a good couple of hours. Bea? She's fine. Please, can we talk about what happened last night? No. There's no time. You need to go. Really go. I missed you so much. I'm gonna cook us something special tonight. Just the two of us. Hey. I hope you're not thinking of deleting me, too. No. You're mine. It's okay. We're just gonna talk. Virtual Companion app. Search. Negative. Search again. Not found. - Ben, let's go. - Miyu's gone. The app. It's been deleted. We don't need to do this. - Of course you do. - I can't. You can talk to them. I don't need to be there. Of course you need to be there. It will be fine. Gil knows what I did. He'll say something. I know you're scared, and I know you're sorry. But you have to sort this, Ben. We have to sort this. Search Hawking seven mundles. Private, research, restricted, classified. Your security detail have indicated that Tia Holcombe is here to see you. Let her in. Good security down there. Thorough. I heard what happened at the Hub when the takers escaped. This isn't my fault. Your family... I'm well aware of what my father has done. What the fuck do you want? Is Kate here? No. She doesn't want to see you. Look, people are worried, right? They're asking questions. That's what we wanted. - We can work with this. - This is what you wanted? This isn't a good mistake that you just learn from. So what's the answer, then? I don't know. That's the scariest thing I've ever heard. If Hatfield's own son can't stop the takers, what hope do the rest of us have? You're right. What? I'm his son. I-I know how to think like him. Please tell Kate I'm sorry. I'm here if she needs anything. Actually, we do. I need to get Kate and Bea far away from me. They'll be safer. We need a place. Martha. Oh, my God. Martha! - Oh, my God. - Sis? It's so good to see you. Oh, no, no, no, you rebel thug. I'm here for you. - Shall we go? - Yes, please. Get me the fuck out of here. Don't do that. Don't look at me like that. Taking Max wasn't personal. What do you want? The same thing as you, Evelyn. To be with my love. My wife. Max is with her. There is a way that we can both have what we want. What does that even mean? You are beautiful. Not as beautiful as her, but... good enough. She needs a vessel. You want to find Max. We know these bodies have chemistry. He misses you. I can feel that much. Shut up. Would you like to speak to him? - I can let him talk for a moment. - Fuck you. Evie. Evie. What... what... what's happening? I... What did I do? I can't... It's so dark. Evie, I don't know... I don't know how to get back. Please! Evie, you have to help me get b... That's not Max. How can you be sure? I know it hurts. Trust me, I know. And I'm sorry, but he is still there. He still exists, and he is waiting for you, Evelyn. He is waiting. I don't understand. The app was planted without Mr. Tomine's knowledge. By who? Well, we're conducting an internal investigation - into that. - And in the meantime, we're dropping all charges against Gil. Hold on. I'll get his details. Gil Tomine. Mrs. Hatfield, I'm sorry to have to tell you this. It's, uh... It's not my fault, Mum. Why are you such a coward? I don't know, Mum. Ev, I found something in my dad's mundles. A lab I've never seen before. Give me a call. Hey, Martha. Tommy boy. - Oh, yeah. Awkward hugs. - Oh, shut up. You know you love me. Hey, um, I'm sorry about your dad. Yeah, um... - Baby! - Right, yeah. Right. You should get a move on soon. "Hey, Martha. How's your jet lag? Glad you're here. Get out." Did you... find something? There's a place that he goes to alone. There's no geotag and he kills the mundles, but... Look, if I can find this place my dad used... Hey, so are we going to this farm? You obviously both can't go back to the farm. Then... where? - Tia has a place. - What? She turned up to apologize. She's asked if you needed anything. - I said yeah. - I don't want to see her again. I know. I get it. I feel that this is the safest option right now. Fine. You stay offline. No matter what, you stay off. Can't let anyone know where you are. After the shit you've been through, you're just gonna cut each other off? You guys need to talk, hash it out. I'm here. I've got a whistle. I'm Referee Martha. You know. - Let's go. You guys need to... - I can't let them be found. You ping Evelyn when you get there. Nothing too obvious. Something they can't trace. I'll see you soon. I hope so. You fucking slow or something? That took seconds. Relax. I'm on cross platform. Taking care of business. You know. Important shit. You've got to take down that vid. What vid? Fucking sleep seizure we faked. - They think I've done something. - Who? Cops! I told them it ain't legit, just a joke, but they still bagged me. You got to come tell them we was just playing. - We was just playing. - They don't believe me! You told me to do it, Dan! What the fuck you got me into? Shit. They want me off. Where are you? Cass. Cass. Stay quiet. Keep it quiet! And stay off! So this is headquarters? Glamorous. Hey. Who's this? She's my sister. Martha. I need a car. Offline. Untraceable. Tom said you might have a place? We need somewhere out of town. I need some time to set things up. I'll drop the car round when it's ready. In a few hours' time. Thanks. Kate. I really am sorry. She's unexpected. Ev? Help me. No. No. Evelyn. I don't understand why you think I'd do anything for you. Listen to what I am saying. You can't come here and ask for my help. Evelyn. No. No. It's okay. I know you're scared, but you don't have to be scared anymore. How does it work? Okay, you can find her. Doesn't make any sense. Ev, it won't be difficult for you. You know Lawrence's code. You can show her a way out. I don't understand. Why don't you do it yourself? - I can't. - I think you're insane. It has to be you. I can connect you to that place. To her. To Stephanie. It doesn't make any sense. What you're saying doesn't make any sense. I remember the path that brought me here. You can use it to get back. Back to Max. Hey. Hey. It's all right. It's actually quite beautiful. In the void. Imagine it. You and Max, together in the dark. She will wear you well. I can't. You can, Evelyn. Because if you can't... I'll have to kill you. I'm giving you a way out, okay? Now read me. Read... me. Let me show you how to find her. Can-can you see it? The path I took? Follow it. Find her. Her name is Stephanie Martinello. Stephanie... Where's the... where's the, where's the, where's the... Tom. Tom, I saw, I-I saw, I saw, I saw where he came from. Um, a-a void, I saw... I saw D's wife, Stephanie. - And I saw others. - Where? Where? In the void! There were thousands of them, everywhere. I found something in my dad's mundles. Somewhere he goes with lab equipment. There's no trace of it anywhere else. B-Bottom right, bottom right. Gray walls. Is that what you saw? - Is that-is that the same place? - No. I don't know. I just... I was just in the dark, Tom. He deleted all the mundles of this place. The only reason I found it was a mistimed deletion. Whatever he did, I think that's where he did it. Ev... But I was connected to them, Tom. If the path is still in my registry, maybe I can isolate the IP and find the coordinates of the room you're talking about. Kate, you have a visitor. That was fast. I haven't finished packing yet. Ben. Hi. Is everyone okay? My presence that much of a shock that it sparks fear? Well, kind of. Everyone's fine. Is Tom here? - He's not on. - No. - Why? Wh-What-what's happened? - I just want to talk to my brother. Is there a problem with that? Hey. No need for the tone. Right. Sorry. I'm... Sorry. It's okay. I know it's a hard time. I'm sorry to hear about your dad. It's nice that you're here. Well, anything for family, right? Right. Ben, we are still family. Want to sit down for a bit? No. Okay. I'll tell Tom you came by. Don't... don't bother. I need to find someone. - Natalie? - A taker was in my house. She wanted to kill me. My baby. Did the authorities come? She, uh, she was confused. She-she left before they got there. Did she say anything? Uh, she wanted to know, uh, where they came from. I didn't know where else to go. No, you were right to come here. How long can you keep this quiet, Mrs. Hatfield? My family and my friends, they don't know. Should they? How many are out there? We need to contact anyone who's ever been affiliated with the company. Some of those people work for other tech firms now. If they find out, they could destroy us. People already want our heads over that shit the Resisters pulled. Natalie had no idea she was in danger. Nobody does. There are nine billion people on this planet. You want them ripping this thing out of their heads over a few hundred? Response teams and drones have been dispatched. We're scrolling public Feeds, Lawrence's mundles. The fugitives will be found, Meredith. That's only telling us who's been taken when they're asleep and on Feed. What about all the others? Husbands are killing wives. Kids killing random people in the street. We have to warn people! Give them a chance. Amanda's right. It would cause mass panic. Share prices would plummet. I don't give a damn about share prices. Our priority is the survival of this company. I disagree. With all due respect, it's not your decision to make. Either of you. Everyone get in line! You'll get processed one by one. Get off. They'll try to read you. I can't turn it off. - I'll fit. - What the hell? Who are you? I'll switch you off. Hey! You first. You gonna hit me again? Justice for Daddy? What are you? You're so primitive. It's adorable. How you persist in spite of your limitations. Grappling for answers, and yet you still know so little. Yeah, well, Evelyn's tracking that piece of information you gave us, so that's about to change. You died. You died years ago. That wasn't me. The memories, though. A gift from your father. He created you. Yes. Guess that makes him my father, too. Brother. Why'd you kill him? Hmm? Why'd you kill him? What? Why'd you kill him? Why'd you kill him?! Why?! - Why? - Because he abandoned us! He was gonna pull the plug. - He was gonna commit genocide! - Ain't genocide - if you're already dead. - But I'm not dead, Tom. I'm here. I'm talking to you. What makes you think your life is so much - more important than mine? - Yeah, I'm not a sociopath. I'm not a killer. You killed Eric. You tried to kill me, erase me. Sociopaths, they lack empathy for humans. - You're not human. - And you are? What makes us human? We've all got our arguments, right? Ego, soul, intelligence, love, compassion, flesh, blood, but none of us know the real answer, do we? How did you get that scar on your neck? You don't even know, do you? Maybe... just maybe, he did to you what he did to me. Brother. Taken, number 1192, deactivated. Wait... m-my... Feed... Stop playing. Move. Jesus Christ! She's faking. Bring her up. I don't think she's faking. - Oi! You seen Cass? - Nah. She's AWOL, bruh. - That or blocking. - Blocking you, maybe, perv. Seriously, man. I think she got rolled on. Legit. We was chatting in VR. They bagged her for the vid. What? That sleep seizure shit? Nah, she's pranking, fool. Nah, man. She was proper shook, I'm telling you. Look, try and ping her, you get bounced back. Serious. We told her to fake that vid. It's on us. We've got to find her. - In? - Yeah. Hi, it's Ben. I'm not accepting calls right now. Ben, I'm sorry about today. We need to talk. Where are you? Evelyn's. She might have a trace to where the takers are. Might isn't good enough. - We need to leave, Tom. - What? We can't stop them, and more are coming. Now, you were right to expose what your father did. People need to know. We need to warn who we can and go. We can find them. We can stop them. Ha. Not even Lawrence could stop them! We can't go anywhere. We can't just escape. This is in us. We'll never be safe. Get Kate, Bea and Ben, and meet me when I send word. No. The car's ready. When I send word, get the family to the plane. It'll be on standby for a month. - What happens if it takes longer? - It won't. I've also made arrangements for you, Natalie and Evelyn. If you want. Don't mention this in Feed. I should go with you. I need you here. That's it over there. Yeah. - That's all then. - All right. I'll see you later, boys. Don't follow me. Hey, look at these ones. All fresh. Straight from the sea. What do you think of these, lads? Take one of them home with you. No, I'm all right, thanks. Just looking. Yeah. I'll buy something. There's no way my dad could've had a lab at home without us knowing. When I was in the void, that's where the trace-route placed it. Built that place as a sanctuary; no labs on site. Not to put too fine a point on it, Tom, but the Hatfields hardly have the monopoly on truth. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. We-we need to go. We find that room. We do whatever it takes. We end this today. We need to leave. You go. One of us has to stay with him. No, no, no. You leave him here. - ICSA will pick him up. - No, no. No, Tom! - Yes, Evelyn! - I'm not leaving him. No, this is not... What do you want to do? I don't know. I don't have a plan. It's dangerous. I can't leave you here with him. I understand that, but I-I won't talk to him, I won't untie him. I won't listen to his lies, and I will be fine, and you can go. But I'm not leaving him, Tom, because I can't. All right. I'll check in with you later. Be careful. You, too. House scan complete. No additional rooms or voids identified. Mum and Dad's garden, zero to 12 years. Fully or partially deleted. Play. 18, 19, 20! Ready or not, here I come. Ben! Ben! Where are you? Ben? Ben? You can't hide from me, Benny Boy! Ben? Aah! It's my turn now. 11, 12, 13... Fast forward. Fast forward. Error. Not found. Rewind. Play. Error. Not found. Ben... where are you? We need to talk. It's a beautiful fish. Straight from the sea, and yours for... 12 pounds. Okay. Ha! My man. Sold. Hey, don't look at me. You sell it, you bag it. Business. Um, yeah. - He'll take it. - All right. You've ruined your suit. Oh, I have more. That fish was only eight pounds. Price adds prestige. People pay for prestige. No wonder she liked you. You're nothing like him. Shall we have that drink? Oh, hey. You're up. I only shook you about nine times. - Our ride's here. - What? Did you sleep well? Sure. Um... I'm dropping off that hatchback you asked for. Manual. - Untraceable. - Right. Sorry. Still waking up. That sounds reassuring. I guess you're good to go. After coffee. We're not hitting the road without our caffeine fix. How long was I out? Not long enough, I guess. We don't have any. What are you talking about? We had some this morning. Well, someone must have moved it. Are you okay? Yeah. Fine. I... I'll sleep more in the car. You expect me to ride on the wrong side of the road? We're on the right side. You're on the wrong side. Oh, yeah? Tell that to the rest of the world. Hey, hello. Okay. Okay. What? You people ready to go? I haven't got all day. Coffee. Right where I left it. I can't feel my feet. They're not your feet. You've got me here because you think he'll come back. I'd stop inflicting scars on such a banged-up body. There won't be much left to love if Max returns. So he can come back? My offer still stands. - Stephanie for Max. - Fuck you! I'm not giving you my body so me and my fiancé can spend our lives in some dark, fucking void. If it was so great, you would have stayed. He was never your fiancé. He never proposed. I did. Why? I wanted to take you for a test drive. You didn't disappoint. What, exactly, is your plan here? I'm gonna untie you. - Clever girl. - I'm gonna untie you when you're too weak to stand. And when you're tired of drinking your own piss to quench your own insufferable fucking thirst. And when you feel sick because of your own stench, because I'm obviously not going to clean you. Then I'll untie you, and we'll go to work. Talk to me. Keep me awake. What do you want to talk about? Anything. Um, are you missing work? Sure. I guess. I mean, teaching math to teenagers must seem like a vacation compared to all this. - Are you testing me? - Huh? Math to teenagers? You know I teach math to six-year-olds. You're trying to trip me up, right? Yeah. Maybe. You don't think I'm me. You think I've been taken. Kate! Eyes on the road. First rule. What's Mom's name? Fuck you! Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben! Ben. Hey! Good on you, hey? Hey? That's the man, eh? Right. Another pint for some answers, you said, so come on. Ah... I don't feel right telling you. She should, you know? Do you know the woman? At all? She likes her secrets. Come on. It was quick. I was in and out of town a couple of times. A one-night stand basically, yeah? But you knew about me? Yeah. So why didn't you ever say anything? Ah, you know, it was the Hatfields. I'd rather live in a toilet than deal with that shit. You know what I mean, mate, yeah? You got any other kids? You looking for a brother or sister? Well, yeah, couldn't hurt. Nah, no, I'm sorry. It wasn't for me. But you've already got a brother. You're doing all right. Look, Ben, I don't think I'm gonna be able to give you the answer that you're hoping for. Steve, what do I owe you? Oh. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I've got this. It's cash only, mate. - What? - Yeah. We're not on. It's just cash. It's not the fucking Dark Ages. Why the fuck would I carry cash? All right, just leave the tab open, and I'll settle it tomorrow, all right? No go, mate. I don't know you. Well, you must live in a fucking cave, then. - I'm good for it. Trust me. - Take it easy. - I got it, Steve. - No, no, no, Dad. I just want to buy you a couple of drinks. Should call you that, yeah? Dad? I mean, not that you've really ever been one, but... You don't have time for that shit, right, mate? No, I didn't mean it like that. I think you'd better leave, son. - Get your fucking hands off me! - Come on. Out! - You filthy lagger. - Hey, what did you say? - No, look, look, look. I didn't mean... Dad... - Yeah. Don't call me that. Right. Yeah. Yeah, of course you don't want me to call you that, do you? Do you? You know, people like you, you're so fucking superior, aren't you? Delinquent father here, everyone, by the way. You think I'm a snob? You, who won't go on, will you? You won't talk to people like me because you think you're too fucking noble. But you're not noble, you're just scared. You dropout lagger scum... - Hey! - Fuck you. Move! Move! Get the fuck away. Hey. Hey. Just don't worry. Go. Come on. Come on. - He just can't handle his booze. - Tom. Tom. You're fine. He doesn't know what he's saying. Here you go. All good. He doesn't know what he's saying. No, you don't know what you're saying. Of course I fucking know what I'm saying. I'm trying to buy my dad a drink, and this prick - laughs at me. - Hey! - Shut up. - Listen to your brother, Ben. - What? - Just go home. Hey. Here you go. It's clean. How did you find me? Mum's security patch. No privacy in this family, Ben. You know that. What family? Look, if you... if you want to talk about it, we can, we can talk about it. I'm not one of your patients, Tom. - Just tell me what you want. - All right, okay, fine. I need your help. What could you possibly want from a pleb like me? It's blood, Ben. It's just-it's just blood. - It doesn't need to mean anything. - No, no, no. Whatever I do, people hate me. But you... You do whatever you want. You reject the family, you ruin dad's reputation, and they just can't stop loving you. What the fuck is that? - What are you talking about? - What? Oh, what, you think my life is perfect? Do you? Not everyone hates you, Ben. I don't hate you, Ben. You're all right. Sometimes. Thanks. I need your side of a memory. Are you gonna come with me or what? Fuck it. Where are we going? Home. Let's go. My company will try to censor what I'm about to say, so please share it. Everyone must know that they are at risk. A virus is coming through the Feed. It is causing erratic, violent behavior, and those affected pose a serious threat to others. It appears as a spasm while you sleep. Do not sleep alone. Watch over each other. Stay vigilant. But above all, remain calm. Do not tamper with your Feed. The issue will... Account restricted. - What? What can you see? What am I looking at? - No, nothing. BEN: Coming to find you, Tom! Ben. I can see you, Tom! - Ben. - Shh. - Yeah, this is it. - Huh? This is it. How did you do that? Dad's mundles. I have his passwords. She's settled, finally. Where is everyone? Tia said Naz would be here. I guess we wait. No, we have to tell Tom that we're okay. There's a gas station a few miles back. You can ping Tom from there. No. I don't feel right about leaving you here, alone. But Tom will be worried. We have to stick to the plan. Sorry. Tired. You know, you've been acting weird since you woke up. Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. What? Martha, I'm fine. Okay, you're fine. Geez. I just wanted to make sure that you didn't have some dead guy in your head. God, that's so messed up. How would that even... Oh, God... What the hell, Kate? I don't want to hurt you... but I will. No! Martha! Martha! No! No! No! No! No! Martha, please stop! Kate, open the door. How you did you know, Kate? Was it the coffee? Does Martha take it black? We can't fool the families for long. Kate, will you please open the door? Will you open the door?
