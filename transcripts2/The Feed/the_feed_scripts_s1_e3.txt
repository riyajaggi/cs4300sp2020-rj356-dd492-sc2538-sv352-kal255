 Share your life. Your memories, mundles, are safe forever. - Busted! - Oh, shit! Sorry, I was just checking... Babe, there's no need to explain yourself to me. I mean, what is a promise between partners, eh? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm off for the rest of the weekend, I promise. - Okay. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Watch me. I was just checking for updates on the hack... Okay, I'm sorry. I am off. Though I did see a message from Kate. - Yeah. - They're on their way. She seemed pretty upset.

 I mean, how could he do that? I can't even imagine marrying into that family. Shit. Okay, um, come on. Stuff to do. Up and at 'em. Get up, babe. Come on. - Here we go, come on. - Put me down. - Quick! Not quick enough. - Yeah. I don't think it'll suit me, but good choice, babe. Are you okay? Yeah. I have to make a quick stop. I promise I'll be quick. Uh... Look, I'm-I'm sorry I have to do this. This is why I love you, okay? Just go. Shh... It's okay, it's okay. You're just in time for my second glass and my second dinner. - Why are you still awake? - Well, the kids are asleep. This is my peace and quiet. Hey, where's my niece? Oh, she's sleeping. - You okay? - Yeah. We're, uh, we're going away for a few days. It's a digital detox farm, so I'll be off, and you won't be able to contact me. Anyway, uh, I wanted to see your ugly mug before I left. Just come home. I love you. - I got to go. - Kate... You didn't have to come. No, of course. Don't be silly. You okay? - Dan. - Oi. You listen. What's up, trouble? What are you doing here? What am I doing here? What are you doing here? I'm your assigned doctor. They pinged me as soon as you were admitted. Ah, you've been tracking my every move, eh? Yeah, I have. I saw the video. What are you playing at? Just for likes? And was it worth it? - I hit 2K. - You hit 2K. If you died, you probably would have hit 10K. That would've been better. Wait, that's a new tier. All right, all right. You scared your mum and me. - What do you want? - For you to be able to talk to me off Feed. That's what I want. I c-c-c... I c... can. You're on too much. It's dangerous. I... kn-know. Do you? 'Cause I can't recall a time you ended a day intact. Look... I'm leaving town for a bit, but when I'm back, I want us to do some serious work. All right. If you're invested, so am I. Get yourself some rest. All right? Thanks, mate. Oh, that's nice, eh? Best assistant one could ask for. - Just like that? - Right, do you want to do the honors? Mm! Okay. Well, come on, then, smarty-pants, don't let me down. How do you think you'd get liquid from one barrel into the other? Mm-hmm. Good start. You need to stop. Max! Max! - Okay. - No, no, no! - Couldn't you have just told me? - It wouldn't have been as funny. - Funny for who? - For me. Right. - Bring this down. - Right. All this over there. Now move these four over here. And then... We're there again, and then, uh, close, close. You headed home? Just checking if there's anything I can do before I go. Well, after your behavior with Evelyn, maybe it's about time you took a break. Have you talked to Tom? He's been off for a while. You're surprised? This is textbook Tom doing - fuck all despite everyone else. - Oh, come on. And he was wrong about the whole "Sara and Anton know each other" crap. We've combed the mundles three times now. - Yes. - They've never, nor has anyone else - in their circles, even been in the same city. - Yes, all right. - There's zero connection. - All right. Ping your mother. I can't get through. - She's away. - Yes, she's in the Mekong. She's off Feed. Signal's glitchy. It's gonna be difficult. Yes, perhaps you're right. I'll see you later. Can you hold it and come back, and then, uh, close. Document. Document, please. Buka! In recent years, the Mekong has successfully lured travelers seeking an escape from the constant chaos and noise of living on Feed. This way. Thank you. - Welcome. - Lovely to see you. Pleasure. It's nice to see you, Mrs. Hatfield. - And you. - I'm sure you saw - the people on the street. - Yes. Somehow, rumors of this meeting got out. The president sends his apologies. The protest was organized quickly to clash with your arrival. Thus, we have high hopes this time. Third time lucky. It's a big commitment. But I wouldn't be here if your contribution wasn't paramount to the success of our community. You do not have to convince me. The president is on his way. Is there anything else you need? No. Thank you. - We come bearing gifts. - Finally! - They're done. - I said it takes six months, and I always deliver. - Mmm. - Ah? - Oh, my God. - The boy done good. - So good. - Fridge it for tonight. - With pleasure, and you are welcome, sir. - Mm-hmm. How are you getting on, Evelyn? We haven't seen you for a long time. Work has just been... let's just say I am happy to be off. - And she is doing so well. - Come on, I haven't been on since. Actually, can we just not talk about it? Just thinking about it, I'm like, what if something big is happening and I'm missing...? - Life... goes on. - Mm-hmm. Let me help. Give me a task. I can help cook. - Um... - No. No. We need an onion chopper. - That's this guy. - Really? Put yourself to use, Max. Fix me a drink. As ordered, milady. How do people do this without being on? Do the bits need to be all the same size? Okay. I, I don't need you guys. I'm good. I got this. Don't give her a hard time. God, I'm not that bad, am I? That's not good. Oh, wow. Are those actual tears? How do you guys do this? Max? Max! Yeah. Yeah, babe? - You okay? - Yeah. Thank you. - Gil? - Uh, no, thank you. Um, more of that. And, uh, double these three. How's it going, Meredith? Connection failed. No mention of Bea being enabled. - Okay? - All right. Let's do it. - Thanks, uh, for having us. - Welcome. - Of course. - How's it going? Good to see you. We overpacked. I'd blame Kate, but... - Wow, okay. - Yeah, how about that? A sleeping bag? Where the fuck did you think you were going? Well, it's you, Max. I, I come prepared, you know. I might end up out here on the gravel. I'm sorry to crash. Mate, it's me. Don't, don't worry about it. We just wanted some distance from my dad, and, and I wanted to talk to you about something. Between us. After everything that happened with the Feed, it going down, and Kate... my dad being in her head... it just... it doesn't feel right anymore. I get it. Um, I'll talk to some people about deactivation. - See if it's for you. - I do need something... Holy fucking shit, mate. You didn't. No. Tomorrow we are on this. This is nuts. I thought you might be pleased. Evie! Look! Uh-huh. Come on. Tour time. All right. All right, guys. So, this is Graham's pride and joy. He grows fresh fruit and veg. - There's even a herb garden down at the bottom. - Wow. Basically anything in season, we can grow. Not too shabby, eh? She approves. Aw. Hi, I'm Jane. This is Graham. - Welcome. - We have a gift for you. It works, and you can get outside more while she naps. - Baby monitor. - Okay, guys. Rules. Everybody helps out. Okay? Cooking, cleaning. Everybody introduces themselves to everyone else, and everyone... stays off. Period. Right. Come on, let me show you your room. Nice to meet you. Lovely to meet you. And you, Jane. - All right. They're nice. - Yeah. - Let me show you the place. - Yeah. Ah! There she is! - President Quan. - Meredith. My apologies for the wait. Please. We've been very well looked after. - Good. Gil. - The protest. - Is it as volatile as they're saying? - No. And I'm well. Thank you for asking. Time's short. Let's get on with business. Pinched nerve oncoming. Reposition. I'm busy. Natalie? Coffee, please. Do you need anything else? Pinched nerve oncoming. Reposition. Natalie, send the sleeping mundles for an Anton Garin and Sara Hoyt. Mum. Checking in. Dad's worried. Check... check... Meredith? Is everything okay? - It's family. - Oh, yes. Here it is. The original Feed 1.1. It'll be a bit slow. It's old. And the border signal is spotty, but you have nothing to compare it to. Once everyone is on... No, uh... if we come to that arrangement. You know, for now... small steps. Maybe just me. What would you like to see? My people, my home, and something I rarely get to see... my own country. May I? I can almost smell the flowers. We have to get the Feed transmitter out of our heads, Max. We're talking about total extraction. Well, why not deactivation? It's no different. - It's not mad dangerous. - It's not enough. It's not. I... you know some people who have removed it, right? Yeah, mate. Hippies who have done too many drugs and can't think right. That's invasive surgery, Tom. You don't do it unnecessarily, and you're a dad now. Exactly. Max... please. Is this Kate? Look. I gather you guys have been through a lot, okay? But just take the weekend. See how it feels. And if she still... then we can talk to Evelyn about some alternatives. Right? But the weekend will be good, man. Be good. I'm going to ask Evelyn to marry me, mate. What? Wait, what? Yeah, mate. You proud? Oh, my... my boy. My boy's all grown up! No way, and we've fucking crashed this thing, man. Oh, no, man. Thank God you're here, mate. You can stop me from acting like a freak. I've been a wreck since I got here. Overthinking. Best time, best way to ask. - Is there a best way to ask? - Fuck knows, mate. All I know is I'm gonna do it tomorrow night. She'll be so happy. Okay. This obviously works. I'm proud of you. - Yeah. - We'll talk tomorrow? Yeah, man, and, and take the weekend, please. - Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah. I will. I just don't understand why that clause is necessary. For true conductivity, it needs to involve everyone. Word has spread fast... These are small business owners who rely on our tourism. We're a unique escape to the world. To be completely off the Feed, they come from all over. Now, I am not of the mind to be kept behind, but I must consider them. Quan. If you want the Feed for yourself, that is your right. But isolation begets paranoia. Don't you want to monitor something before it's even started? Instead of reacting to a future insurgency. An insurgency? History repeats itself, Quan. Kids are already sneaking across the border to get enabled. It's dangerous for them and for you. You're just saying that. It's what salespeople do. When the signal works properly, we can see who has the Feed, Quan. So will you. What's going on? - Has he got it? - No. No. It's-it's a glitch. The signal doesn't... - Kill him. - Wait, no! Go! Out! We need to go. Now. I had a contact leave an SUV at the back. We're okay. Connection failed. President Quan has reassured his people that there is nothing to fear, but anxiety is at an all-time high. After two failed attempts to negotiate with the Hatfields, people feared this meeting would seal the country's fate. - The army has been... - Connection failed. Fuck's sake, Meredith. Where are you? President Quan... Well, then I can't help you. I'm not asking for me, I'm asking for Meredith. I'm not sure if you realize this, Lawrence, but the C.O.M. is another country. You have friends. What you're asking for is a highly trained special team that would breach the U.N. charter by invading a foreign country. That costs money. I'll pay. And if it goes wrong, it's my head. If it goes wrong, it's all our heads. I don't think you realize what this woman means to me. Without Meredith, there is no Feed, which makes her the most important woman in my life and yours. Sue. I'm asking you as a friend. Okay, in here, this is good. In here. Stay down. - Knock, knock. - Oh. - Mm. Oh, hi. - Milady. Oh. Oh, hot toddy. That's hot. Look, tomorrow will be good. All right? We'll try to sneak away. Just the two of us. Won't that be rude? Tom and Kate will understand, okay? We need some time to ourselves. Well, I have you to myself right now. Yeah. I've, I've-I've got a headache. O-Oh. O-Okay. No worries. Get some rest. He asked me to not overreact. See how we find the weekend. Maybe he's right. Yeah. Here. If I tell him, he'll understand. No, he'll tell Evelyn. They're our friends, Kate. I don't know what that means anymore. I mean, Lawrence is your father. He's gonna ask her to marry him tomorrow night. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Here. - Hey. Hey, hey, hey, it's okay. Here, let me. I'll do it. - It's okay. - Yes. Is Daddy here? VR, Dad. The algorithms that you use to find cases similar to Sara and Anton's sudden violence, eye-gouging, Feed going dark, can you send me the results? We had hundreds of thousands of results. Nothing panned out. - Can you just send them to me? - Why? Well, I've been combing Sara and Anton's sleep mundles, hour by hour, looking for... uh, something, anything. And... look. You found a connection. How did you know to look at their sleep cycles? Ah, just a hunch. But I thought, maybe, if we got the other cases, see if this glitch comes up... Right. Case study 93735, origin Sara Hoyt. There, I've given you access. Check it. Peak R.E.M., heart rate 155, eyes open, 5.3 seconds exactly. Ah... A religious woman in Rome stabbed her cheating husband, then stabbed herself in the eye. The family said it was biblical. Though lex talionis started with Hammurabi's Code, not the Bible. - Reason over God. - Drug addict. High on salts. Stabbed out his eye in front of his cousin. Center. Zoom. Zoom. Zoom. It wasn't your fault. Don't think about it, trust me. You didn't know. - I should have known. - How could you? I think the building's clear now. It's safe to go. You didn't kill him. Quan did. Come on. Nothing gets fixed if you die here, too. - Nice shot... - Ah, nice shot... - Yeah! - Whoa! - Great shot. - Great shot. Bravo, Evelyn, perfect shot. Okay, who's next? Kate, fancy a shot? - Come on, Kate. - You're American. This is your thing, no? Gratefully, not that type of American. Never even held a gun. But in the name of America... self-defense and all... I'm a vegetarian. Max. - Max? - Max, come on, Max. - Your turn. - Uh, no. - I'm good. Just here to watch. - You sure? You? Who made me hunt deer with an actual bow and arrow. I couldn't even pull the damn string. Yeah, well, those who eat meat should have the balls to kill it themselves. Nice balls, Evelyn. Thanks, babe. Keep down. No! I told Santiago police - to keep him alive, but... - Yes, well... it had to be done. Good work. Ping me if it happens again. What? That's it? What else is there? Nothing, I... I just thought you'd be happier. Well, I have a lot on my mind. Besides, this poses more questions than it answers. I just know what it's like... to be disconnected from the woman you love. I didn't realize you felt that way about Miyu. Throw yourself into work, right? And... enjoy the victories. What victories? This boy just lost his father. We have no idea what this thing is or how many people it's affecting. This glitch can only be located in people who have gone to sleep with their Feed on. So what about all those who haven't? Serve them up, come on. Ready? - You want some, Will? - Yes, please. - Okay, how many? - Two. - All right, man? - Thanks. Supposed to be a party, man. What you doing? Oh, yeah, I know, I know. It's, um... sorry. Talk to me, bruv. What's going on? Um... Sara and Anton. I just... I keep replaying what he did to her in my head, and it... What did he do? He snapped her neck. Just... and then he ripped out his own throat. Um... fucked up. You okay? Uh... Yeah. Yeah, think I'm just, um... think I'm just overwhelmed. Yeah, tonight's the night. Right. I set up lanterns in the woods. Lanterns, lanterns are good. Yeah, yeah. I'm going to... I'm gonna ask her out for a stroll after dinner and, uh... take a knee. It's gonna be great. She's gonna love it. Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, man. Uh... yeah. Cool. - To you. - Cheers. Uh, Jane. What needs doing? Few more logs on the fire, maybe. Thanks. - I'm gonna... - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. - Good, good. - Yeah. Good. Come and get it, folks. Who's for another one? Come on. Come and get it. Not bad, right? This could be us. Always. I was thinking more like a lake house. In Michigan? Look, I know you can live without your family, but I-I can't live without mine. I mean, I just can't stomach the thought of being so far away from them without... Look, no pressure, just... think about it, yeah? Okay. What? - Okay, okay? - Okay, okay, - okay, yeah. - Okay, okay? Yeah. I mean, yeah. We'll need to settle a few things first. You know, we... find a doctor... and then I sort out my patients, but... but yeah. Oh... Oh. Oh. - There she is. - Still works. - Do you want me to...? - No. - No? - No. Max? Max. She's crying. Yeah. So you do something. I-I wanted to. She's so small, I... I didn't want to hurt her. Look, I... Max, I didn't mean to... You're gonna give yourself a heart attack. When am I gonna learn? It's never gonna happen for me. I'm never gonna be that son whose father gives a shit. I turn up. I do all the hours. Meanwhile, Tom... He could literally shit on their faces and they'd thank him for his time. Your dad has a lot on his mind. You sound just like him. I thought you wanted perspective. I don't know what I want. Yes, you do. - I love you. - Good. Sounds like you mean it. What are you doing? Can I come in? I just want to talk. No, Ben. You can't just walk up here uninvited. You're still my wife. Not in a few weeks. Well, you haven't moved out of our apartment yet. Why not? That must mean something. I just need you to respect my boundaries. Okay? We said we'd give each other space. I don't need space. I love you. You don't even listen to me. Okay, what? - See, this was always our problem. - Please. Miyu, I'm listening. I'm not the woman you love anymore. She doesn't exist. Please let me... Come to me, come to Daddy. Come to me. There we go. Get some rest. - Okay. - I've got this. All right, let's go. You want to go to the car? All right. I almost thought I lost you. I almost thought you had. How the hell did you get her here? Well, I... I paid. It's your favorite. Hey. So, how'd it go? Did you pull the trigger? - Did she say yes? - It, it didn't feel right. What? - Lanterns and all? - Yeah. Fuck summer, mate. Days never end, lanterns look like shit. Listen, I'm sorry if I freaked Kate out, - before. - No, no. Don't be silly. Evie loves you, Max. She does. She's here for you. Okay? Look, I have to get this one in the car. It's the only thing that gets her to sleep. - Come on. - No, no, no, no. You don't have to. Don't be ridiculous. I'll drive. You're good at that. She just loves being driven. - Already demanding. - Yeah. Max, if you won't give me a name, I'll have to find one myself. - That's not fair, mate. - Help me. Please. My mate Abel might know someone who's had it done before. Okay. How do I speak to him? He runs a pawnshop in south Brixton. South Brixton... Hey, hey, hey. What's the name of the shop? - Huh? - The pawnshop. What's it called? Uh... Right, yeah, um... Max, you okay? Why don't we...? You know, we could... Let's head, let's turn back. Head back to the farm. Yeah. Yeah, sure. I've just got this headache. - But she's still fussing. I don't mind... - She's fine, mate. How long have you had that headache? Um... Since we got here. M-Max? Unlock the doors. Unlock the doors, Max. Max? - It's getting dark, Tom. - Unlock the... Open the doors! It's getting dark... Open the fucking doors, Max! - Run. Run. - What? Run! Aah! Kate Hatfield is currently off-line. Fuck... The persons you are trying to reach are currently off-line. Please try later. Tom? It's me, it's Max. Look, I don't know what's happening to me. Tom? Okay... Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry. It's over. Baby... baby...
