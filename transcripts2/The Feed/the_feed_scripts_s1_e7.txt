 Share your life. Your memories, mundles, are safe forever. I need to go. I need to do something. We are here today to read the legal will of Lawrence Emmanuel Hatfield.

 - grandchildren... - Can we please skip ahead to his mundles? That's what we need. All personal files are... Uh, no, I'm sorry, there-there was a preamble. Uh, Ben, this section is actually meant for Tom. If you'd like to leave the room. Why? - Well, I just thought... - I'll join you. He hasn't asked you to leave. He asked me. Well, is there a section just for me? No. No. Just for you. Go ahead, James. I'm comfortable here. Meredith? - Yes. Ben... - No, Mum, I'm actually quite interested in what he has to say. I mean, Tom doesn't mind. Do you? You see, he's always been the favorite. Lawrence made sure to show me that at every turn. So if you're worried about how I'm feeling, don't be. No one else is. Say it. "All personal files are to remain "within my biological lineage, "starting with my son, Thomas Edward Hatfield. "In the event of his death, transfer will move to his children." "Biological." Mum? There has been a violent murder this week at the London headquarters of the Feed. Lawrence Hatfield, inventor of the Feed... The man went down faster than a prozzie. - No fucking balls. - Yeah, what would you do if someone - was jabbing into you? - I'd get the fucking knife. Blade in my bare bloody hands, all that. He was cuffed. You know he was an actual person, right? I heard Hatfield was screwing his bird. Hot woman who worked for him. I don't think that's it. Tom's all sorts of weird over this shit. Keeps warning me to stay off. 'Cause he's always been a lagger. Maybe Tom was in on it. You shut the fuck up. Sorry, Danny. Fuck. Share it, mate. The hell's that? I don't know, but they're popping up. They be kipping and freaking out like zombies. People are coining half a mil. So, everyone knew but me? I only recently found out. Well, this must be really hard for you, Tom. I suppose that's why Lawrence put it in his will, so I couldn't contest. Clever bastard till the end. - Tactless, I agree. - "Tactless"?! I-Is that the best that you've got? I mean, I knew that you were a good liar, but-but, wow, first-rate. This-this one lasted, what, 28 years? Ben, please. And where are you going, golden boy? Do you want me to stay? Well, you might as well stick around and see the whole soap opera. No? She's your mother, too. Unless... You got any other surprises up your sleeve? Tom was ill, - and your father... - Which father? - Lawrence had made every... - Just-just... just shut up. Okay? I don't want to hear it. Ben, you are still my son. We're brothers, Ben. Nothing changes that. You're both so fucking condescending. Ben. Why didn't you tell me? Would you really have wanted that news coming from me? No. I tried, man. I-I wanted them to say something. Yeah, well, turns out they did. Dad told me, right before... And I thought he was being figurative. I'm such an asshole. You're not. You're not an asshole. I don't know what to believe. I meant what I said in there. Okay? You're my brother. I'm here. You got a lot of important stuff on your plate. You're needed at the Hub. Start searching through his mundles. I'll be fine. I always am. I want to see my lawyer! Let go of me, you bloody idiot! Let go! Hey! What's going on?! You're taken! You're coming with me! Stop struggling! Open the fucking door! - Step back. - Ryan. Step back. You're being transferred. I hope you mean fucking released. Sue? Hey, Sue! What's going on? 60-plus people have been taken. We need some place to contain them. You're making holding cells? We're clearing cells at the back of the Hub, but we're expecting more. - More...? - Come on! Hurry up! Jesus. She's just a child. There's going to be trouble. But I'm making sure we're ready for it. I need some agents, if you can spare them. I have my dad's mundles. - Are you sure that's a good idea? - It's fine. I just need some help. The faster we find the takers, the faster we can end this. Hey, this is not your fault, Tom. - Gil! Hey! - Tom! Gil! Wait! - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop. What's going on? - Tom! - We need the room for the taken. - What? He's being moved to a prison so he can be processed. - Prison? - Look, you pay his bail and he'll be out. - It's just procedure. - Tom, - I'm not a criminal, Tom. - I know. I know. I'm gonna sort this out. I promise. Please! You're making a mistake! I've done nothing wrong! I want to see my lawyer! Do not engage with them! What about this one? She's classed as a vulnerable. I want my mum. Please. Get in there! Please. Where's my mum? Where's my mum? Don't leave me. Swab. Swab. Heart rate's spiking. COM didn't predict this hypertensive episode in APW. Pen. - Where's the anesthetist? - She's on her way. - Well, get her here faster! - She's coming. Pupils back to normal. Cancel the order. But we'll have to keep an eye on him. The procedure went well, Mr. Barker. Just don't scare me like that again. Hi, it's Kate. I'm offline right now, so leave me a message. Hey. I'm gonna go through his mundles now. Just... be careful. Opening Lawrence Hatfield's Feed. Activating mundles. - Go, Kate. - Masks are working. No alarms yet, but we have to hurry. The guards are always on. We won't be seen. Oh, Daddy, do you love me? Daddy? "The world's most perfect family." "Ben Hatfield." Who the fuck is that? I can tell you. Ah, no wonder I created you. Someone to tell me exactly what I want to hear. Go on, then, Miyu, you fucked-in-the-face hologram, tell me who I am. I can show... show you. I can show you. I can show you. Don't look at me. Dr. Hatfield, Mr. Barker, he... Call your husband! Fuck you! Security! Security! Evelyn. What are you doing here? I work here, Natalie. I'm sorry. I... I need your help with something. What? Where is he? Hi, Evie. It's nice to see a friendly face. The other interrogators are so cold. You're gonna be in a lot of pain in a few minutes. Tell me who you are. You can call me D. I've already given up that much. When did Max die? At the farm. Put up a good fight, though. And SAVEYOU... did it do anything? It let me see how close you two once were. You loved each other. It was sweet. Did he ever stand a chance? None of you do. So all of this... everything that you did to Tom and to Max and to me... was just to get to Lawrence? So why didn't you just take him? Do you know what you are? You're a rapist... and a murderer... and a fucking sociopath. Just like your little mate, Eric. You know, I think he enjoyed cutting into me. He wasn't so smart, was he, poor Eric? When he was running his mouth in the car, you shut him up, and you know what that tells me? That you are scared. Which means you are weak. Which means you will make mistakes... D. You should have killed me when you had the chance. Amanda. Meredith. I am so sorry. How would you like to handle this? I can speak first, if you would prefer. Please. Mm, um... reassure them, and, uh... I can field questions after. Mrs. Hatfield. Ms. Javad. They're ready for you. Thank you. Thank you for having us today. As some of you know, I'm Amanda Javad. I'll be running the Feed in partnership with Mrs. Hatfield. I know you're anxious for her statement. Please, consider her strength at being here despite the recent loss of her husband. Lawrence was a visionary, taken from us too soon. His murderer, a cowardly madman, was seeking to undo the good that the Feed has brought to the world. But Meredith... but Meredith and I promise... we will not let that happen. As requested, Kate Hatfield's mundles found in Lawrence Hatfield's files. How's that, sweetie? All clean? Does that feel better? Yes, I think so, my beautiful girl. Don't tell me not to be here, okay? You're not at home moping, and... I have to be here. I have to do something. Okay. You found anything? Just that he felt... actual emotion, even when he was in my wife's head. I don't know what... what to say, Tom. No need to. I need to do this. I need to remember who he actually was, so that I don't lose it. Let me help? I know his codes, so we should be able to move through it quite quickly. Well, we've got 30 years of research to get through. You want to take ages 45 to 50? - Sure. - Okay. They're changing guard soon. We need to hurry. Shh. I need to focus. I can't see a fucking thing. - Put your fucking mask back on. - Do you want me to hurry or wear my mask? 'Cause I can't do both. I'm sorry. Do your thing. Are you close? I'm in the server that's holding the private details in grid ten. It'll net everything in the next few hours till we get back to HQ. Then we'll flip the switch, and it sprays their financial data across the world. Releasing these publicly should be enough to make people feel exposed. - Hit the Feed where it hurts. - Hurry. There you are... are. There you are. Ben. I'm sorry to hound you at this time, but Miyu was attacked by one of the taken. Don't worry, she's fine. But we need a game plan. Potential curfews, rolling blackouts... Something to curb this as much as we can until we find out what your father meant. My father. Do whatever you want. - Just leave me the fuck alone. - Excuse me. Miyu? Miyu, it's me. - Miyu. - Hey. - Are you okay? - Mm. I'm dealing. - Oh, look, you're hurt. - Whoa, whoa, Ben. Ben, okay. It's fine. All right? I handled it. I kicked him in the nuts. Right. But don't you think - that we should at least... - No, Ben. Okay, no. No, please do not get involved. ICSA have him, and I'm really trying hard not to let it affect me. So if you can't control yourself, then maybe you shouldn't have come. I'm calm. Why did he ask for you? They're targeting my whole family. They were trying to get to me through you. They? Who is "they"? Who are you talking about? They're coming. Shit. Gloves. Henry? Henry? - He's gonna be okay, right? - Yeah. It's only an EMP. - Can we go now? - Yeah. I'm done. Let's get the fuck out of here. Get down. Where are you going to? Back to the Hub. Let him go. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Lawrence Hatfield, creator and chief executive officer of the Feed was murdered earlier this week in a shocking attack at the Feed's London headquarters. The crime scene is currently closed off as the police conduct forensic examinations and take statements from witnesses. It is understood that members of Mr. Hatfield's family were present when the attack took place and witnessed his murder. They are being interviewed at this time. No news has been released about the perpetrator. Sad, innit? I've seen you before. Hovering close to him. You're a Feed fuck. Fuck off. Why wasn't you there, man? Are you looking for a broken neck? It's Feed fucks like you are the reason we're all in here. You invaded our minds. Used our thoughts against us. No, the reason you're in here is because you're scum. Are you scum, too, then? What'd you do? Did you go off the rails after Lawrence Twatfield got what was coming to him? Fucking hell. That's assault! You just bought yourself more time. We're gonna be good friends! They'll get smaller with time. Pretty soon you won't even remember them. Will you, Tom? File remainder could not be found. - You found something? - My dad, he-he deleted some of Kate's mundles, right? Right. Okay. All right. Mundles, Tom Hatfield. Opening Tom Hatfield's Feed. Kate's head is not the only one he invaded. Play. Pretty soon you won't even remember them. Will you, Tom? File remainder could not be found. Mundle day 827. Lawrence deleted your childhood mundles? He deleted everything he didn't want us to know. This is nuts. Get us a drink, Naz. And pour us a big one, yeah? The hack's still running at the server farm. It should have compiled the net worth of about three million people by now. That's got to be enough. We can't risk waiting any longer. No, we have to look up. Check everything that he deleted. Everything. Even if it seems like nothing. Even if-if it is nothing. We need more hands on deck. Gil, Ben, anyone who knew my dad, everything. - We have to keep looking... I know, I know. - Tom. I know. It's fine. It's fine. Take a look at this. See if you can figure out how they got this in Gil's Feed. We need to get him out of jail. This is the app? There's a whole revenge porn section. You can make videos of yourself with your ex, you can make pedophilia. He had to have gotten this on the dark net. He didn't get it; someone planted it there. It's leaking information on users. I'll take a look. I'll save the user info and delete it from the Feed. Shall we do this? Hit the switch. Come on. We're in business now. It's working. I don't know. I put a security detail on you, by the way. Thanks. I'm... I'm sorry. You've had a lot coming your way recently. Gil... now this. I'm sorry about your dad. - Well done. - Yeah, well done. It's working. It's working. I did call, I just... What's that? What the fuck? Is that your financial statement? Is that yours? Ben, what is happening? Don't worry. It's just a glitch. What the fuck? Thank you, Gwen. You can go. - I don't think that's wise. - I don't care what you think. Let me out of here! I need a hospital! Let me out! Shit. Shit, shit. Kate said she was gonna do something. What did she do? She said just-just a small leak to show - how vulnerable the Feed... - Tom, what did Kate do? Walk this way. We need to go. Come on. We need to go. Tia, did you mean to fuck with the other Feed systems? What? No, just personal info. Why? 'Cause half of fucking London's out! Every other street light and home control system's gone mental. There's been talk of curfews, rollbacks. This is just Sue Cole fucking up. If you're sure. Let them deal with it. I don't care anymore. I'm where I need to be. I can't work you out. And I used to think that's what made you so mysterious. It turns out, I'm just a dick. Hi. Does it hurt? Let me out! Mrs. Hatfield? I'm fine. Go away. Mrs. Hatfield. Let me in. Ben. Mm. Wait. Slow down. - Slow down. Okay. - Mm. Hub's out. Too many people have... Who fucking cares? We were robbed. Some peeps got to see other peep's fucking mundles. Why didn't we? Man, only the posh got something to hide. They be freaking. Who ordered pineapple? - I did. - For fuck's sake, man! - Sweet and salty. It's a contrast, innit? - No! You're sick, man. You're lucky I'm not Italian, or I'd kick your fucking arse. She's doing it. Oh, shit. Look! Is she faking? Maybe... but the world don't know that. Possession, mate. Spray. - Come on. - Stay calm. - Just follow the sound of my voice - or the persons in front of you. - Come on. Ah! Ben! Ben. Fuck me. Ben. Fucking demonic possession, mate. Fuck, Derrick. You didn't fully sever the waves. The memory grid's encoded with the power. It's too fucking dense! I had about two minutes to finish months of work so you could hit it today! All right, all right. It's fine. Everyone shut up and stop breathing in your mics while I fix this. Tom! The gun! The knife... just give it to me! Come on! Let's go! Go and find the others! You said it would just be a few sprays. That's not what we've done, is it? All that talk about reintegrating competitive systems... I'm getting it back on. Just give me a few fucking seconds. - Kate! - I have to go. Ben? Will you just... just...? - Oh! - Fuck me. Ben. Okay, I... - You're being... no, Ben. - Increase compliance. Ben! What the...? Ben, stop! Stop! - Jesus fucking Christ! - No. Miyu, Miyu, Miyu. - Miyu, I'm sorry. - What the fuck is wrong with you?! I'm sorry. No, no, no. - I got carried away. I got carried away. - Just get out! - It's too far. - I got carried away. I'm sorry. - Jesus Christ. Get out. - Please. Just-just listen. I'll... Tell me what to do. I'll do anything. - I'll do anything. - Anything? Get down on your knees. Clean my floor. Wha-What? With your shirt. Mm. Uh... Uh, how... how clean do you want it? What the fuck is wrong with you? You need to leave. - No. Miyu. Miyu. - No. Jesus Christ, Ben, you need help, okay? You're sick in the head. Please go. Now! Come on, let's go. We've been looking for you. Is that the baby? Shh. - Get your fucking hand... - Oh. Ev? Ev? Come on. There's more. Hurry. Take this, take this. Take it! It's all right. Come on. Come on. Police! Drop your weapons! What? Police! Drop your weapons! Okay. Hello? Hello? Ben? I'm all wrong, Mum. Why am I like this? Don't do this to yourself, Ben. But it's not me. It's you. It's Dad and the Feed. Why did you have to link it to our thoughts? Some things are meant to be buried. I've done such horrible things, Mum. She hates me. It's over. What's over, Ben? Miyu. And Gil. Oh. I-I... I didn't mean to. Mean to what, Ben? Sue was gonna find the app, so I put it on him, but if I thought it was gonna go this far, - I-I would have stopped... - Oh, God. Stop! Shh... Oh, Jesus Christ. Uh, I'm sorry. I am sorry. Mum, I am. I am, you've got to believe me. Try to get some sleep. I'll sort this tomorrow. Tom? Where's Bea? She's asleep. - Look, I know what... - They got out. All of them. They-they... they all got out. Who? The takers. At the Hub. People died, Kate. That... that wasn't... They almost got Bea. Don't look at me like that. We can't take it down. I would have never gone to the warehouse if I knew it would release them. - Yeah, well, it did. - Because the Feed - controls too much! - Which is exactly why we need it. Spoken like a true Hatfield. Who are you? - Who am I? - One of us could be taken next, - or have you forgotten? - We're trying to stop this. I'm trying to stop it. That's-that's who I am. But you don't even know if that's possible. You need to sleep. We both... need sleep. I'll take first watch. You almost feel real. Only almost? You should adjust my setting. - Hi. - Hi.
