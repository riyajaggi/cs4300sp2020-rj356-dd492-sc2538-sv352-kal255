 Share your life. Your memories, mundles, are safe forever. It's okay. Yeah. Can we hurry this up, please? I don't know why we're taking a family photo now when we have to meet with the security council. We need to behave normally. If we cancel, it'll bring even more attention. Ben. Glass, please. Dad, what does it take to, um, you know, look in someone's

 head... Feed... head, whatever? What do you mean, what does it take? The steps. What're-what're the steps that you would take? Well, you'd ask for their permission or file a request with the ICSA and they get a judge's signature, which takes for-fucking-ever, or... Whose Feed are we talking about? Was just wondering how your investigation is going. Ah, well, it's a bureaucratic bloody nightmare. All right. - This is easy. - Oh, it's... - No, I'm used to it. - Hey, shall I, uh, here, - I'll take her. I'll rock her. - Sure. We don't want her screeching during the pictures. She's just like her father. The only way I could get you quiet - was through the Feed. - It's probably why I was crying. You eyeing up your competition? Places, please. And smile. Why? Why would you...? I don't want to do this. Getting heavy. Are we home now? Yeah? God... - Tom? - Yeah? Something's wrong. It was there, wasn't it? You felt it? Something in your head? Okay. Okay, it's all right. There's no one in here. The Feed's clear. Wait, but-but there's evidence someone was. They've even erased some mundles. What? Mostly while you were sleeping. - That makes it worse. - Who... who was it? I don't know, yet. ICSA, maybe? Or a hacker? They could've got in through the breach. Wait, wait, someone was in there with me live? Looking at me? My-my thoughts, my... my private... With me in the shower like that? I don't know specifically what they accessed yet, but... yeah. Fucking hell. Who would do that? Wh... It-it had to be ICSA. I mean, they've been looking - through employee records just trying to clear suspects. - I'm not an employee. They're going inside people's heads? Not exactly. They've been looking at the mundles stored in our pool, but whoever did this was monitoring Kate while she was on. I mean, not just looking at stored memories, but experiencing what she was experiencing with her. - Wait, you can actually do that? - Wh... I-I suppose so. I've never seen anything like this before. I mean, it's... unique. Is she a suspect? Are they gonna arrest her? No, no, no, of-of course not. She hasn't... You-you haven't done anything. - Like that's ever stopped anyone. - What were they looking for? What were they looking at? I don't know. But there's only a handful of people who could've done this. - There's only one who would. - Who? No. No, Evelyn... Evie? He's right, Kate. It was Lawrence. No, come on. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do the words "do not fucking disturb" mean anything to you? Sorry, Ben, but you had said to tell you ASAP if we found anything. Well? I hate to... Um, it's a bit difficult. - I really respect her... - Go on, Natalie. It's Evelyn. She's downloaded something internal from the server and then deleted any trace of it. Thank you. You can go. Fucking pervert. I can't even comprehend why your dad would sneak into her head. I mean, people do this? You do this? - Do you think I do this? - I don't know, Evie. I mean black is white, up is down, your father-in-law is in-fucking-side you. Can he make her do stuff? - What? - I mean, what the fuck, Evie? This guy's taking stalking to a whole new level. Lawrence isn't stalking Kate. He had to have a reason to do this. He always has reasons, just never the right one. Can you block him? I'm sorry. Just to figure this out, I had to trick the server into thinking that you were a coding project. I-I don't have the clearance to block Lawrence, - and even if I did... - He'll get around it. If I... I should've known. You know, I thought maybe there was something wrong with you. I mean, that's why I was being weird. I tried not to be, it's just... You know, after Anton, and then you said something was in your head. After Bea was born, you seemed to forget all about it because... He deleted her fucking mundles. Why would he do that? Because he wanted to cover his tracks. Okay. Can we all just take a breath here? What Lawrence did was shocking, yeah, but we don't know why. Look, he doesn't just do things like this. - Listen to yourself. - I am! This is just one small scintilla of abnormality. You don't know him like I do. You don't see what he does. You don't see what he creates. It's not this. It's the Feed. And I work for the Feed. Can you pull everything of mine he's ever looked at? Every mundle, every moment, every thought? I want it all. Oh, come on, Evie. I'll send it to you. No, no, I want to make sure he can't delete what he's done. I want a hard copy. You want it offline? How? I got a guy. Deals in vintage tech. He'll have the hardware you can download it to. I have a lead. Evelyn downloaded something confidential from our servers. She has clearance. We looked. She's clean. I'm more interested in her boyfriend. Offliner with a bunch of lagger friends? I wouldn't be surprised if he's a Resister. So you think that they're working together? Worth a look, I'd say. Just put a hold on her clearance and tap her account, all right? Have you got something you want to say? - It's not my place. - That's right. You're not the one who gives the orders around here. You're just the one who holds my beer while he takes them. Oh, I saw that family photo, by the way. I look good. I'll try and get off early, so we can leave sooner, yeah? Yeah. What, you packed? Shockingly, yes. Just haven't been to the farm in such a long time. - I'm excited. - Who are you and what've you done with Evie? We need a weekend away, even if we can't use this. Yeah, I don't... I don't want to do it on anymore. It's like having sex with a stranger and I'm realizing I don't miss one-night stands. Are you trying to seduce me? It doesn't feel like you, and, shockingly, I-I like you. What's that about? So this-this isn't about last night? Last night with Kate, look, I'm sorry... - I know that you hate my job, I get it. - Oh, but you love it. I get that, that you see the good in it, and you're not like your boss. Like, he-he needs people like you working for him, and, well, people like me against him. That's why we work, Evie. Yin, yang, all that bullshit. Look. Go on. Yang me. - Idiot. - You lucky woman. Uh, you know I'm not standing at my desk watching people in their loos, right? - I do. - Just, I'm-I'm coding things like solar energy and-and physiological support to decrease newborn fatality rates. I would never invade people's privacy. God, you say a lot of syllables. Look, I know what you do. You help people. I mean, you helped Kate. This has got nothing to do with last night, and everything to do with you. I love you. I want you. Regardless of how many toilets you're watching. Shut... Shut your face. Shut it. Did this come from inside? Is our network secure? How do we know this won't happen again? Has private information been leaked? Should you have such a broad reach? The question isn't how this happened. It should have been when would it happen? We've been facing down the barrel of a Resister threat for years. The effort to hide among off-liners is part and parcel of a policy of evasion and deception set at the highest level of the Resister movement. Therefore, we need greater access to mundles for proper security. We need to use the Feed to help the Feed. You want to abuse the rights of enabled citizens to spy on people who don't align with you. That's suppression of dissent. The Resisters are a nuisance, but they're not terrorists. How do we know that they're even at fault? With respect, Resisters have placed bugs in our applications, they have spray-painted slander slogans, they have cut the power to a server farm in Albuquerque, they have damaged a signal tower in Canada. They are an anarchist organization solely focused on dismantling our infrastructure, which would result in catastrophic harm to every single citizen regardless of enablement. Now, we would know where they were and which faction was responsible had you heeded our warnings and taken a harder stance on off-liners who use our network freely, by the way, but don't stay on, and it's your failure to confront this threat that's to blame. I assure you, we just need to identify those responsible to secure the breach. With that said, we are simply asking for permission to access to the mundles of off-liners known to associate with Resisters and spray a public request for information. The hack was an act of terrorism, which makes those guilty terrorists. We're just asking the public for help. If you have any information about the Resisters, or know of any off-liners who might, please contact your local police department. Do not engage. Resisters are considered highly dangerous. Please contact your local police department. Do not engage. Danny, your school's phoned! They want to know where the hell you are! Danny? Danny! Hey. Sorry. Bea's asleep. What can I do? What do you need? I don't know. I need to know why. I'm gonna see him now. - He's just gonna lie. - I know, but I'll make sure he won't do it again, and I will find out why. - Somehow. - I don't like being afraid, Tom. I'm not good at it. Hey. Look, as strange as it sounds, I don't think it's about you. I think it's about what's going on... Anton, the hack, he-he just doesn't understand that that doesn't make it right. He never has. Yeah. Well, whatever he says, get more. I will. And you? I need to know what he was looking at. More data, more control. Book report, ten minutes. See that guy? Do you think he's one of them? What are the odds? Ow... Smooth. I've got to go. See you lot later. The critical segment of code must have made its way through to the kernel, giving over administrative control and spraying the video. We need to reroute these drives, shut them down and look for a row hammer. I saw your ad. I guess the ICSA meeting went well? They agreed with our strategy, but levied a fine. We've ruled out Firewalk and antagonistic AI patterns. It has to be a row hammer. Only an employee could have let that in. I thought everyone had been cleared. Well, they have, so we're dealing with an impossibility. All I can tell you at this point is that it definitely came from within. And a Resister could never have made it inside. They just don't function at that level. We finally made it through to the last layer of the video. They didn't sign it. This isn't like them. They like to take credit for their work. This is far more advanced. And when we find it, I guarantee it won't bear their signature, either. Well, thank you, Evelyn, but we don't know that yet. Carry on. If it's not the Resisters, then who? I don't know. The Americans? The Russians? The fucking mafia? Look, let's just stick with our plan. You've been in my wife's head. Why? I wanted to make sure she was okay, that you and Beatrice were safe. Why wouldn't we be safe? Well, at the photo shoot, you seemed rather worried - about her. - No, it started before then. Your mother said that Kate was having headaches. - I wanted to check on her... - No, no. - Check on the baby. - Bullshit. You did this because of Sara and Anton. I don't know what happened to them. I've spent the past two years trying to understand. Then there was the breach. I thought that was handled. That's what people want me to say. People need to be reassured. But honestly, I don't know what the fuck's going on. The whole world is looking to me for answers, and I don't know what the fuck to tell them. You think that gives you the right to violate people? I wasn't looking at anything other... It doesn't matter. It's disgusting. It's illegal and if you ever come near my family again, I'll make sure everyone knows how fucked up you are. Well, forgive me. For your mother's sake. She doesn't know. It's my fault, I did it, I'm sorry, and strange as it may sound, it made me feel somewhat closer to her. To Kate? To Beatrice. My granddaughter. She's part of you. Why do you care about me so much when you don't even fucking like me? You're my son, Tom. I want to see Anton and Sara. If you've spent the last two years trying to figure out what's wrong with Sara, that, that's a hell of an investment. You claim they're why you did this. If something's happened to their Feeds, - I-I want to know what it is. - Well, you won't get anywhere. - She's crazy, he's... - Are you hiding them? Of course not, I'm trying to help them. Then let me see them. You won't find anything, Tom. So what's the harm? Can we turn on the light? She prefers it like this. Hi, Sara. I'm Tom. We met at my brother's wedding. Did you draw all of these? She started a few weeks after she got here. We paint over them occasionally, but she puts them right back up. Only time she moves. How long has she been like this? A year. Where's Anton? Oh, shit. See, you can try and put a lemon on your knife, you can try lifting your tongue up and breathing through your mouth, like this... but, you're gonna fucking cry, okay? Just face it. Treat the onions as your enemy. Toss them into the oil as soon as it starts to shimmer and watch them fry. Carla is gonna help you render the duck fat. Season, buy local and stay off near open flames. All right? Have at it, guys. Okay, guys, keep chopping. - You all right? - Yeah, um... - You said you knew a guy? - Yeah. - Override. - Evelyn. Can you come with us for a moment? I can explain this, Ben. I just need to talk to your dad. He's gone. You can explain it to me. Come on. Thanks for getting me this. - Oh, that's all right. - Are you sure everything Lawrence saw in my Feed is in here? - I'm sure. - All right, darling? - What are you looking at? - Oh, oh! Oh, she's a new mum, David, run. It's safe! - What was that? - I'm sorry, I'm just a little on edge. I hope I never piss you off. Hey, Ronnie. - Yeah, man. Yeah. - Say hi to your mum for me, yeah? I need to get home before Bea gets hungry. - Share a cab? - Uh, I've got to get back to the center. I'm running a conscious eating seminar in an hour. - Interested? - Hell no. I live for my shame cakes. All right. Are you... are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm working on it. Thanks. Hey, man. Listen, I need to ask you for a really big favor. I just done you a favor. But this time, I need something in the back. Shop's closed. I want it to be a big surprise. See, I love that you roll your own cancer, John, it's proactive. We're all gonna die someday, right? I blocked you. I've been trying to reach you since I heard. - Did you know? - No. I would never condone that. Can I come in? Can we talk? I don't know if I can trust you. Of course you can. I'm completely on your side. Lawrence was excited. He just wanted to see the baby. Well, I hope he memorized her. That is no excuse, I know. Please. Can I just come in so we can talk? I'm not ready to talk. Kate. You're not responsible for him, Meredith. He makes his own bed. But you sleep in it. Anton. It's Tom. Do you remember me? I want to go home. I may be able to help with that. Can we talk for a bit? My mum, she say to say nothing. She has lawyers. They will... bring me back... She say it's temp... temp... Temporary insanity? I'm not sure that's right, Anton. I think something is happening to you. Can you go on for me? Problem with Ben. Oh, fuck. You're not the only one, Anton. Her name is Sara. She also felt something in her head, something dark. Something that made her gouge her own eye. Now she can't talk. She can barely move. I don't want you to slip away like that. They think her Feed is the reason. That it did something to her brain. I don't want the same thing to happen to you. Do you know her? Have you ever seen her before? You know, we don't have much time here, Anton. When you see your mother, if-if you want to hug her, if you want to tell her that you love her, if you... Come on, man. Y-You need to work with me to see if we can reverse what's happening in your head. You are a nice man, but I am not. After what I did to my father, maybe I deserve that. Have you guys been here since I left? We moved a bit. So I've been at school all day sitting around like a mug, and you guys been here fucking about? Say hello to the next generation. We've been Resister hunting. Marcus sprayed that guy from earlier. - The creepy one. - Yeah. I'm finally getting some love from my followers. Hey, I'm drowning in likes. You hit 13K, it transfers to coin. Yeah, filling up my bank. That's not fair. 'Cause I'm saving for an upgrade. That was my guy. - Should've sprayed him. - He wasn't even a Resister. He was just some drug dealer, wanting to know if we "wanted a hit." You jealous, Dan? Fuck that. I can top Marcus. How? You already broke your arm spraying live. Didn't even reach 90 coin. He could break his head. Go off Feed, make his brain - go nuts. - No one would care. We all fried when the Feed went down. But no one got a vid. Come on, Danny, I could log it. Yeah. I feel safe in your hands. What about you, Cass? You want to be in my hands? Psychopath. If you don't do it, I will. No. I'll do it. It's mine. Come on, Marcus. You got me, yeah? What? You think I'm slow? Mm. Friends, mates, enemies, it's your Danny-Boy. Ha. Coming to you live from my humble abode. Willing to go to the ends of my own Earth to create content for your prying eyes. Don't forget to coin, or spray, if you like what you see. I mean, which you will. I'm about to stake my life on it. Ready? Oh, shit. Danny. Danny, go on. Danny, go on. Danny. Shit. Danny's mum! Danny's mum! Danny? Danny? Call an ambulance. What the fuck? Ben, I have SCI-level clearance. I cannot tell you about my applications before they launch. If you need to know, get your father in here. She's right, Ben. You downloaded something from our servers and then deleted your footprint. If you don't tell us what it was, we'll have to gain access ourselves. Fine. That means going through Lawrence, so go for it. I'm not making this accusation lightly, Evie. You have one of the highest security clearances here, and yet, you are dating a Luddite. - So what am I missing? - Max? H-He runs digital detoxes. The fucking company advocates going to them. - That's how we met. - We're looking at everyone who could want to hack us and could bypass the kind of security it took to do this. There are very few people that fit that category. You think Max and I colluded to take down the Feed? The man can barely recall a mundle. Right, he's not a fan. So is he a Resister? That is ridiculous. And even if he were, they didn't do this. And you know that, do you? Besides, if you know Max so well, what was he doing in this neighborhood all afternoon? Why the fuck are you following him? Uh, uh, uh. You gave us a reason to the minute you stole something from our servers. Now, we don't have an angle on that room yet, but we're working on it. Unless you want to tell me what's in there? Probably some... Leave. No, she illegally... She invented our new programming language. She helped make the Feed what it is. She wouldn't destroy it. Everybody out. Thank you, Gil. Stay. I'm sorry. He was completely out of line. Well, technically, he was just doing his job. I did something suspicious, he flagged it. You should be proud. Duly noted. Did you tell him what you were doing? No, I can't, without a subpoena or your permission. You do know that decoding Kate's Feed was against the law. So was looking at it. People outside this company don't always understand what we're doing here. What are we doing, Lawrence? Going inside people's heads, invading the private lives of employees? I came to work here because I thought that peer-to-peer communications were gonna redistribute global power. We're supposed to be helping people get into the modern economy, not colonizing private users. We aren't. There has been a terrible misunderstanding. It's a private family matter. I've worked it out with Tom... so how can I work it out with you? Stop looking at my mundles. Right. You have my word. Stop following my boyfriend. You're using something I helped create to betray him. - If he ever found out... - He doesn't need to know. I know. Of course. Well, we trust who you trust. I trust him. Then he's off the radar. Thank you. Am I free to go? As long as you come back. Give me the weekend to think about it? Well, it's a long one. I hope you're doing something fun with, uh... Max? Max. Yes. You see? I've forgotten him already. Is Bea's announcement ready yet? We need to project an image of unity. If the Hatfields feel safe, the world will, too. Not exactly. Uh, Kate has withdrawn her permission. Naturally. To pile on, we've found a problem. The pin Kate is wearing in the picture bears a symbol for the Feed Free COM movement. And she wanted the photo shoot to be on her terms, and this is the result. Do you want to keep or remove it? If you don't, you'll never get the COM to sign on. Can we take them again? No. They'll never agree to another photo shoot. I'm sorry. - Are you okay? - No. And I thought were were coming together as a family. What if we replace the pin with another cause Kate can get behind? Brigham Child Welfare needs funds. If Kate has questions about what they do, I'll tell her what foster care was like... until I got your scholarship. She can't argue with that. And it looks good for you. You're one of their biggest donors. That could work. Y... Kate will still hate me, but... Thank you, Gil. I wish my family would comport themselves like you. Hi, you've reached Evelyn. I'm not accepting your calls right now. Evie, I think Lawrence might have done something to Bea. Something really bad without our permission. Call me. He wouldn't talk. He barely said anything, but... I just... I get the sense that-that they know each other. - That Anton recognized her. - I don't think so. We've gone through all her mundles before this happened. We're going through all of his. Nothing in their past indicates even a remote acquaintance, or puts them in the same vicinity as each other. Anton grew up in Russia, and Sara lived in Birmingham her whole life. Why's... where-where's he... where's Anton going? - He wanted to get out of his room. - But Sara's still down there. They're about to bring her in for dinner. Ping the orderly, have them bring Anton back in. Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Now! Now! D-D-Don't, don't do that. Y-You don't want to do that, man. I know you're scared. I know... I know you think there's no way out, but... but there is. You can come back from this. Let me help you come back from this. All right? - Too late. - No! Guard! Help! No! Help! Help! Help! Hey. You ready? Yeah. How was your day? Same old. Helped Kate. Ran some seminars. Came home. - Yours? - Yeah, same old. By matching the structural and mechanical properties of the electronic and biological cells, systems spontaneously... of the electronic and biological systems... the idea of moving up the blood vessel is that you avoid any direct penetration of the brain tissue. Alternatively, the mesh can be precisely targeted to any region by syringe, and forms a seamless and stable interface with neural tissue. Stable interface with neural tissue. Hi, I'm Pam. How can I help you? I'm having trouble with my connection. - I can't see my daughter. - I can fix that. Please pull up your settings function. Okay, I'm there. No! No! No! Help! Help! I'm sorry you had to see that. The doctor should never have left them together. I was the one who made them a-aware of each other. It's not your fault. I don't know if it was brain trauma caused by the mesh, but... but they knew each other. Yes. Apparently. I'm not sure how. You're welcome to look at their mundles before they went dark, but we couldn't find anything. I don't want to be here. With you.. with this... Go home, Tom. Beatrice will be fine. Do you see an option called "notifications"? - Yes. - Select it. Okay, I've done that. Now you should see an option called "alerts." Yes, I see it. Now do you see an option called "accessibility"? - Yes. - Select it. Do you see your child's name? Yes. Select it. Oh, my baby! My baby! They put the Feed into her. They enabled her. They enabled her in-ute. That's what Lawrence was doing inside my head. You'll need a whole fucking field of those. Well... I'm sorry. What more can I say? A lot more. They're off now, Lawrence. God knows if they'll ever be back. I'll give them a few more days. It'll all blow over. Blow over? Do you even understand what you have done? I don't really need this right now. Anton just snapped Sara's neck like it was a fucking twig. And if the hack does come from inside, it's only a matter of time before that leaks out, and I still don't know what this senseless visual video mind-fuck was, so I'm not really concerned if Kate is ever-so-slightly pissed off. This is my life's work, and it is under attack! - Our. - What? Our life's work! And I'm about to sell it in the MeKong. Look. All that matters right now, all that really matters right now, is we find the bastard who's responsible and we fix that, and we can fix the rest. I'm scared, Lawrence. For the first time, I... I'm really scared. We built this as a family. For our family. How has it come to this? - You're quiet tonight. - Hmm? Oh, I... I'm just thinking about work. Well, stop. We came here to get away from that. All right. When we get there... don't tell anyone about Bea. We don't know who we can trust. I just... if Max can get us to a doctor, we can try and get this thing out. It's not about trying, we have to get it out. They didn't just enable her without our permission, they-they put her life in danger. What happened last night, what I saw... we have to get it out. Okay. We're there to get away. We figure things out. I'll find a moment to talk to Max.
