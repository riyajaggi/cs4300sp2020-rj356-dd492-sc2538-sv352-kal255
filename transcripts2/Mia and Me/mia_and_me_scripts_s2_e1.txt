 You still have your truck? This thing is older than you! That's right, and we both still do just fine. Right, girl? [crash] Oh, good. I've been waiting for that to break off. [Mia laughs] Is your truck meowing? I mean, it's an old truck, but that's just weird. Open it. It's for you. [kitten meows] Oh! Are you serious?

 She's beautiful! [kitten meows] She told me her name, but I cannot remember it. It was, it was... Mimi? That's it! Mimi! Hi, Mimi! [horse grunts] You have a horse? That's Johnny. I know he doesn't look like much... Stop saying that! He's beautiful! [Mia] It's all beautiful! [Grandpa] I'm finally at home here. The rest of the animals are over there. Vegetable plot that way. You're turning into a real farmer. Is that so hard to believe? Hmm, maybe it is. [Mia laughs] Tarzan! Mia is here! Tarzan? [dog barks] [Mia laughs] You said there were other animals? [Grandpa] That's Gypsy and King. That's Bertha. Tuca and her family. [Tuca baas] The ducks, the geese. And those are chickens. [chickens cluck] Come on, I'll show you your room. - Oh! - [Mario yells] I'm sorry! I didn't mean to... It's okay. It's just my scalp. Probably it didn't even leave a mark, right? No, not in the way you think. I'm Mario. Um, Mia. And you know what? I think I should go and catch up. Mario is the summer farm hand. - Nice? - Grandpa Renzo, just show me my room. Sorry, it's, it's a little small and messy. But I tried to find some stuff you'd like. I found a few of their things when I packed up the old house. My parents never could get my hair right. I will leave you to get settled. Come down when you're ready. We will tidy the room up together later. I'll be right back, I promise! [meows] [bracelet] Hi, Mia! Say your password. With guards down, a new threat arrives. Generosity is a disguise. You'll get used to this! [meows] [laughs] Whoa! [yells] Maybe we could do that together. [laughs] Oh, that sounds wonderful! [screams] Oh, as beautiful as I remember! Even more so! [wings flapping] - Mo! Yuko! - Mia! Mia! [Mia and Yuko laugh] I missed you guys so much! And we missed you, Mia! Where are your waterglares? Panthea's defeated, Mia, remember? What do we need weapons for? Centopia is at peace! To be honest, I kind of miss mine. [Yuko makes shooting sounds] [laughing] The sun is shining! The unicorns are safe! Nothing in the world could darken my mood! [water squirts] What the... Ah, Phuddle! Sorry, Your Majesty! I've almost got the water dome working as a lawn sprinkler. I just need to make a slight... Oops! [screams] [laughing] Thanks, Mia! Mia! Welcome back. What a surprise! So good to see you again, Mia. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Oh, dear, no, nothing important. I was actually looking for Onchao. Onchao's moved out of the crater. He lives with the other unicorns now. Oh, that's wonderful! He'll be so happy to see you. You should go say hello! You bet! [laughs] See you soon. See you soon. Bye. Bye, Mia! [unicorns neigh] Lyria! I'm back! [Lyria neighs] [giggles] I am so glad to see you again. Where's Onchao? [unicorns neigh] Whoa, whoa! Now, cut it out, you two. - Hello, Onchao. - [Onchao neighs] [laughs] I missed you too. Now, what are you and Esko fighting about? Don't you know Centopia's at peace now? [Esko neighs] But Esko, Onchao cannot help having wings. His wings are a part of how he is. [Onchao neighs] [Esko grunts] H Oh, my! What exactly am I looking at? That's a good question! Oh, boy! Whatever it is, it's coming this way! We... we'd better check it out. Let's call Mia. To Mia! I know what it's like not to be accepted, Onchao. I had trouble making friends at my boarding school. But with some effort and time I ended up with two of the best friends I could ever hope for. You just have to be yourself. [Onchao grunts] Mo and Yuko! [sighs] Peace was fun while it lasted. Gotta fly! See you all soon! - [Onchao grunts] - [wings flapping] Wow! What am I looking at? [Mo] Still a good question. Don't get too close! [gasping] [laughs] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! Step right up, and witness the most incredible, exotic creatures in the greatest show there ever was! I am King Raynor. Queen Mayla. How do you do? Ah, it's an honor. Please excuse my unexpected visit. I am a circus director, the one and only Rixel! [fireworks explode] And this is Funtopia! My purpose here, to invite all the elves of Centopia to experience the most spectacular circus show of all time! Whoa, hey! Personal space! - [Rixel whistles] - Personal space! - [Rixel] Down boy. - Eww! Eh, he can be overly friendly at times. [laughs] Welcome to Centopia, Rixel! Oh, thank you kindly, Your Majesty. Let us get acquainted. Won't you join me in a tour? - Oh, that sounds lovely. - Mo! Yuko! Supply our guests the freshest fruit and our finest spring water! Oh, can I help? Please! This is the perfect occasion to try out The Rocket Roller. It's my latest invention. [Raynor groans] Come on then, Phuddle! [Tukito makes monkey noises] [grunting] Wow, Onchao's gotta see this. I'll get him! [wings flapping] Off you go, my pet! You know what you're here for! [Tukito makes monkey noises] [Tukito sniffs] [screams] [Tukito makes monkey noises] Onchao, I know just the thing to cheer you up. There's a circus in town! [Onchao neighs] What's wrong, Onchao? [screams] [Tukito groans] Poor thing. He's learning the hard way not to eat too many partridgeberries at once. [Tukito groans] - [Tukito makes monkey noises] - [Onchao grunts] [Tukito makes monkey noises] - Hmm, that was weird. - [Onchao grunts] Yeah, a thank you would have been nice. [grunts] Filthy, meddling, nasty elves and their disgustingly magical unicorns. [grunts] I must find a way off this cursed island. If I could just find a boat or a balloon or... one of those. [wings flapping] [Xolana] Why do we have to carry these stupid old crates? [wings flapping] [grunts] This is extremely heavy! stinks too. Nasty elves. - [Lasita] What did you say? - [Xolana] I didn't say anything. Okay, easy, easy. Hey, Phuddle, watch out with that trap! Huh? [yelps] Watch out! That's my fizzy fantastic turbo fuel. H My insulated brain de-bumper, to protect my important brain [Mo and Yuko laugh] Now for plan B [Phuddle grunts] Oh. [wings flapping] And this is where the magic happens - What's back there? - The animals But I'll show you them next time. Anyway, I understand that Centopia is also home to some extraordinary creatures. Let's see, just thinking at random here, um, unicorns Er, unicorns. They are very shy animals. It's rare to even catch a glimpse of one. Is there anyway to lure them out of hiding? So you can get a look at them? [Phuddle screams] Make way! Genius inventor coming through! [wagon crashes] - Oh! - Ooh! - [Mayla laughs] - Foolish thing. Where's he going? Where's Phuddle? [groans] At least my brain de-bumper worked. My bump didn't get a single brain. Huh? Oh? [screams] Dragon! [wings flapping] - We're not armed! - At ease, young elves! Gurga's my star attraction! She's not dangerous. - She doesn't look very... - [Gurga breathes fire] [yelling] Actually, she can get a little cranky when her sleep is interrupted. We should let her finish her snooze. [Gurga grumbles] I've got a bad feeling about this Rixel guy. Me too. [Tukito makes monkey noises] You went swimming? [Tukito makes monkey noises] With a snorkel? [Tukito makes monkey noises] Extravaganza! [laughs] I see now, my pet! [Yukito makes monkey noises] There, there, look what I have here. [Onchao neighs] [groans] With guards down a new threat arrives. Generosity is a disguise. Stay away! You're scaring him! [laughs] Wonderfully timid creature. Let me touch it! - No! Onchao, go! - [Onchao neighs] Come on, mistrustful girl. I don't want to hurt him. Come back here! Buffoonery! I thank you all so much for the supply and assistance but I can manage the rest on my own. - Goodbye. - That's it? What, that wasn't enough? I spent my whole day... I mean, yes, sorry. I have things to do, you know, do. That means you leave. Thank you! [wings flapping] He might be a bit strange, but I like him! Now, let me see. [bone cracks] [gasps] [Tukito makes monkey noises] Master! [Tukito makes monkey noises] Master, I have wonderful news! [gasps] Master! How dare you disturb me! Master, I've found it! The winged unicorn! You're certain of this? Well, it's a little different than you described. It's not black. And it's just a foal. But it does have wings! Intriguing. This cannot be the winged unicorn Ono, but perhaps an offspring of his. That will do. Deliver this winged foal to Dystopia and your wish will be granted. I'll become a Dark Elf, just like you? A full member of the Dark Elf society! With all privileges? And I'll live on Dystopia? You have my word! Extravaganza! Dystopia! Land of Darkness and Destruction. Home, sweet home! You have until the next full moon. If you fail me, you lose everything. [Tukito makes a monkey noise] Your precious fluid, your animals, and your floating island! [Tukito makes monkey noises] - Gargona! - Master! Who are you? I'm a Dark Elf, trapped here on Centopia. I sent her queen on a mission to Centopia in times past. But Panthea did not report back. Please forgive me. Her failure was not mine. I just want to come home. Not yet. You may still be of some use to me. I don't trust this bumbling fool, Rixel. I'm standing right here, you know! Help him capture the winged unicorn and you'll have your passage back to Dystopia. Thank you, Master! It seems we are to be partners. H His generosity is a disguise! Mia's Oracle must be referring to Rixel. [Onchao neighs] Onchao doesn't like him, that's for sure. The guy's got something up his sleeve. I'm sure Raynor sees right through him. [laughs] Who's going to the show? I know I am! Okay. So, I guess we're gonna need proof. Oh! Oh. It's too bad you have to go so soon, Mia. It was great seeing you all again. Don't worry, I'll be back real soon and we'll find out what Rixel's really up to! [Onchao neighs] - Bye, Mia! - Bye, Mia! - [kitten meows] - Oh, Mimi. If only you could come with me! - [Mia] Hi again! - [Mario yells] I promise I am not doing this on purpose. It doesn't make it hurt any less. One more try. I'm Mia. Still Mario. - Hey, you wanna go for a ride? - Sure! That's too bad because this thing won't start at all.
