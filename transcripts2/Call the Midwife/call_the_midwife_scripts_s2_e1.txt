 Call the Midwife (2012–…): Season 2, Episode 1 - Episode #2.1 - full transcript 
 Jenny visits pregnant Molly Brignall who is submissive to her abusive husband Ritchie even though he has driven a wedge between her and her mother Marjorie. Molly gives birth in hospital but discharges herself early at her husband's behest. The consequences are disastrous though at least it lets Marjorie into her grandchildren's lives. Sister Evangelina and Trixie have to scale a precarious rope ladder on a Swedish ship,whose captain's daughter Kirsten is about to give birth. The nun dislocates her shoulder so that Trixie - successfully - carries out the birth. She is,however,horrified to learn that Kirsten has been used as a prostitute to keep the crew happy and she gives the young woman the strength to leave the ship and lead her own life. Chummy meanwhile considers mission work in Africa.

 'It seems to me,
gazing back across the decades,
 'that my journey into womanhood
began on the streets of East London
 'working as a midwife in the
city's poorest quarter.
 'I never knew an idle day,
a misspent hour,
 'a single moment without some
sense of purpose.
 'I could be bone tired
and I would rally exhausted
 'and bounce back time and again.'
 Many happy returns, Jenny!
 Thank you.
 'Life was fuelled by learning,
but there was laughter too
 'and I was forging friendships
that would last me all my days.'
 Stop! I've got something in my shoe!
Oh, Cynthia, do hurry up!
 The bus won't wait,
and neither will Rossano Brazzi.
 Never mind Rossano Brazzi,
there's Chummy!
 Sorry. Sorry! Sackcloth and ashes!
Evening, ladies.
 Hello, Peter!
 I just got into the most atrocious
fix with a steamed sponge pudding!
 One has to constantly top up
the pan with water,
 or else the tin will just... explode.
 There's no harm done, Camilla.
Go and enjoy the film.
 I can still see
bits of syrup on the braid!
 'We strove to serve women,
living alongside and amongst them.
 'Men were creatures that you
married, or marvelled at,
 'or yearned for,
or found somehow perplexing.
 'Mainly, they made work for us,
and we knew no rest.'
 All hands on deck!
 Sister Julienne has already
gone to Mrs Hall.
 Her waters broke
a week before the due date.
 Clinic starts 2.00 sharp,
this afternoon.
 In the meantime, Sister Bernadette,
you will man the phone.
 Yes, Sister.
 Nurses Lee and Noakes,
you can take the booking-in list.
 Yes, Sister. Nurse Miller, I think
we should add in Mrs Mournsey
 to the morning calls.
The baby's refused the breast again,
 and we should check him
for tongue-tie. Yes, Sister.
 Oh dear, have we started?
 These kirby grips have got
a mind of their own this morning.
 Where would we be without
Nurse Franklin,
 bringing up the rear
like a poodle at the circus?
 Mafeking Buildings are all yours.
 Single-handed? Hmm.
 But there's been 18 births
there this month alone!
 Hark at the oracle!
 Maybe you can ask them, while you're
there, if they know what causes it.
 But, Sister, from experience...
 Experience?
 If you had more experience
and less confidence,
 I might be
inclined to listen to you.
 Mafeking Buildings,
and that's final. Yes, Sister.
 You'll just have to
keep your head down, Trixie.
 Sister will have forgotten
all about it by the end of the day.
 You might get a supplementary
lecture during clinic.
 I got "needing to learn some
respect" the other day.
 What Sister Evangelina needs to learn
is that respect goes both ways!
 And you can hold your horses,
young Trixie.
 I have never known a chain drink
as much oil as yours.
 We don't want you coming off
and incurring further wrath, do we?
 No. And you can ignore all that
stuff about experience.
 What she says deep down,
is a load of hot air.
 Trouble is, Fred,
deep down I know it isn't.
 Heavy boy. Little butterball.
 Off you go.
 Mrs Collins?
You've forgotten something.
 Oh well,
plenty more like her at home.
 Mrs Brignall?
 Molly Brignall?
 Nitrous oxide,
also known as gas and air,
 is a wonderful method of
pain relief.
 Is it the same as that pethidine?
 In my view, it's much better.
 We'll be offering nitrous oxide
in the new maternity home.
 I want to stay in me own home!
You've got a car.
 Why can't you bring it in your boot?
I suppose in theory I could.
 Doctor only comes out
in complicated cases!
 Now, if Doctor's agreeable,
 we'll have a little demonstration
of how this apparatus works.
 Thank you, Nurse. Er,
perhaps you'd climb onto the couch.
 It's perfectly safe to inhale
the gas when you're lying down,
 as of course you will be
when you're in labour.
 Nurse Noakes, if you'd take over.
 This form of pain relief
really is top-hole.
 The midwife will turn it on
and off for you,
 but rule number one is you
start to breathe the gas
 before the contraction
really gets its boots on.
 Thus, the pain begins.
I indicate this to my attendant.
 The gas is activated.
I breathe in and out.
 As Nurse is saying, you then simply
breathe deeply and evenly
 until the contraction passes.
 It reduces the pain,
and gives a hazy,
 relaxed feeling that many
describe as being rather pleasant.
 What if you take an overdose?
It's not possible.
 Nurse remains in charge,
and after the contraction,
 a few breaths of ordinary air
will bring you round.
 Nurse.
 Nurse?
You can let go of the mask now.
 All in all,
a thoroughly pleasant sensation.
 I'll have one of them.
 I don't hold with all this gas
and air malarkey.
 It's downright cruel,
showing a woman pain relief
 when you can't give it to her.
 We can give it to them.
In the Maternity Home.
 Maternity Home.
 Since Dr Turner lost his wife,
he's been nothing but grand schemes.
 We'll have half the East End
trying to book in there
 instead of gritting their teeth
and getting on with it!
 They shouldn't have to
grit their teeth and get on with it.
 All of the younger midwives have
been trained in analgesia.
 I've been trained myself.
 When are you going to
get yourself to an optician?
 Your work
and your patients will suffer,
 if you can't see what you're doing.
 Sister Evangelina, Molly Brignall
missed her appointment today.
 Oh, another one?
 She's almost at term, and we haven't
seen her for four weeks now.
 You'll have to call in
there tomorrow
 after you've finished
your morning list. Yes, Sister.
 Hello.
 What other options we got, Mol?
What other options we got?
 Cos I certainly can't
think of any, can you?
 Don't know.
 No, you don't know, do ya? Hey?
 We've not got a penny piece.
What am I supposed to do?
 Ritchie, it's nearly my time!
I can't do it!
 Midwife calling!
Is anyone at home?
 I'm afraid if you don't answer,
 someone more senior will have
to call tomorrow.
 Come in, Nurse.
 Cup of tea, Nurse? It's in the pot.
 No, thank you.
 I'll bring a fresh bottle of milk
back after I've done my shift.
 Tinned will do.
 Whatever the lady wants, hey?
 I'm sorry to call by unannounced,
 but it is a worry
when you don't come to the clinic.
 It's on the wrong bus route.
 What's this?
 Banged it on the handle
of the wardrobe.
 According to your notes, you're
down for a home delivery, Molly.
 I'll have all this
looking like the ideal home by then.
 Oh, hello, lovely!
This is my little Lorraine.
 It's only the nurse.
No-one's going to hurt you.
 I can't understand why that
hovel has been
 passed as fit for home delivery!
 I checked the records
when I got back,
 and five weeks ago it was
deemed as suitable.
 Jenny, five weeks ago, it was!
I passed it fit myself.
 It was probably her mother.
 When I delivered Molly's first,
 she was at it non-stop with
the Stardrops.
 If someone was helping Molly,
then we have to find out why that
 help has stopped, and if it can be
resumed before the baby's born.
 Sister Monica Joan,
you haven't had the Swiss roll.
 I cannot excite
myself about a fatless sponge.
 It is principally air,
and I feel untethered by it.
 You must speak to Molly's mother.
 If an improvement cannot be
guaranteed,
 then Molly must be booked into the
hospital for a hospital birth.
 She was adamant
she didn't want that.
 Or more to the point,
her husband didn't want that.
 Sorry. But I find that the most
disturbing thing of all.
 What I wouldn't
give for another cup of tea!
 No shilly-shallying!
 By all accounts,
Bella Collins pops them out
 as though she's shelling peas.
 With any luck we'll be
back in time for Horlicks.
 Here comes the cavalry!
 Bella! It's the nurses.
 Obviously not a false alarm!
 I'll leave you to it.
 Hooter's gone
off for the evening shift,
 I need to go and buy myself a pie.
 It'd just be inconsiderate,
asking her for sandwiches.
 You'll wear yourself out, Bella!
 Now, Nurse Foster says last time
you had a splendid chat
 about Pat Boone
between contractions.
 And during contractions
I screamed my bloody head off.
 Oh, it never gets any easier.
 And I've gone off Pat Boone
since he sang Tutti Frutti.
 You're ticketty-boo.
 Now if Nurse Miller helps me
rearrange the bedclothes,
 it might well be
when we examine you,
 you'll be ready to start helping
baby on its way.
 Aw, full marks, Bella!
 You've already put
the paper on the mattress.
 I reckon it's a right
big bugger this time.
 What's going on?
 Sorry, old bean, you're still only
six fingers dilated.
 Seems this baby isn't quite such
a Speedy Gonzales as we thought.
 I'm getting too old to do
this again!
 Stuff and nonsense,
you're quite the spring chicken.
 Perhaps you'd like to try
some pethidine?
 I'm not going down that road again!
 It makes the wallpaper look as
if it's moving.
 I need the doctor.
 I'm quite sure we don't need to
trouble Doctor...
 Haven't you ever heard of a
mother's instinct before?
 I need him to come.
 I'm in agony!
 Mrs Gray?
 Has my Molly had the baby?
 No, Mrs Gray. I need to talk to you.
 Molly was as good as gold till
she was 14.
 Then she got a bust,
and started giving lip.
 She started saying, "Why did you
send me off to the country?
 "Didn't you want me?
I never asked to go."
 She'd been home years then,
 I shouldn't think she could
remember being on the farm.
 Was she evacuated, during the war?
 Tenterden, in Kent.
Molly and her brother.
 Labels round their necks,
brand new plimsolls.
 And their dad was just
a telegram on the mantelpiece.
 Missing in action at El-Alamein.
 Mrs Gray. The worst thing about my
job is that I sometimes have to pry.
 I'm afraid I've come here today
to pry about Molly.
 You don't want to be getting mixed
up in her sort of mess.
 You're a young girl.
 You want to be out doing
your dancing, somewhere way up West.
 No, I don't.
 I did my dancing during the war.
 It was like my kids had been
magicked away.
 I thought we could just pick up
the pieces when peace came,
 but we never did.
 My boy's in the Army now.
 I saved up, got a phone put in,
but he never calls.
 Got keys cut for Molly,
but she don't come round.
 We are quite
worried about Molly, Mrs Gray.
 I was wondering
if you yourself had any concerns?
 What, you mean apart from him?
 Apart from him and including him.
 She won't talk to me about anything.
 She's always saying, "Ritchie
loves me, Mum. He protects me.
 "He never lets me out of his sight".
 I never wanted her to marry him.
 When the first was on the way,
I was terrified he wouldn't.
 But he did.
 If Molly can't clean up her living
conditions, Mrs Gray,
 I'm very much afraid that Social
Services will want to get involved.
 Is it as bad as that?
 It's every bit as bad as that.
 Help me!
 You were right to send for me.
 I'd always be concerned
about ante-partum haemorrhage,
 when the pain is very acute.
 But all is well.
There's no cause for concern.
 Oh, none at all.
I'm only having a bloomin' baby!
 Everything's going like
clockwork, Bella.
 Absolutely. You'll be done
and dusted in an hour or two!
 I want gas.
Dr Turner's got some in his boot.
 He said so,
when he was at the clinic!
 I want gas!
 That's right, Well done,
Bella. Well done!
 I just want little pushes now.
Can you hear me?
 Little push.
 Head's born.
 Bravo. Absolutely top-notch.
 And so is the gas and air,
if I may say so.
 Now, Bella, I want one
absolutely mammoth push,
 and then it'll all be over.
 Concentrate now!
 Congratulations, Mrs Collins!
 You have a little girl, Bella.
 I'll be spreading
the news about that gas.
 Oh, just you wait,
they'll all be wanting it!
 Thanks, Mum.
 Don't have to thank me.
I'm your mother.
 Wonderful.
 The flat's in pristine condition,
and so are you.
 I'll let Sister Julienne
know all's well,
 and register you for home delivery.
 Nobody told me
we'd be having company.
 Molly's baby's almost due,
Mr Brignall.
 She'll have regular
visits from midwives from now on.
 I didn't mean you. I meant her.
 Get out! Get out!
We don't need you here!
 I look after her.
I know what's best.
 If you know what's good for yourself,
now leave. Don't push me! Leave!
 Please don't hurt her!
 I will hurt her unless you leave!
Get out!
 Get out and leave us alone.
 I've said it to her,
and I'll say it to you.
 You clear out of my home, or I'll
burn her, and I'll burn her again!
 That's enough.
 Where's Lorraine?
 She went behind the sofa.
 You've seen him in action now.
 Yes. I have.
 It certainly sounds like assault.
 But we need to speak to
Molly Brignall.
 Could an officer go round
to the flat?
 We could try. But if she won't press
charges, we can't prosecute.
 I could press charges.
Ritchie threatened me!
 I think, if you did that now,
 Ritchie would not allow Molly
to receive care.
 The needs of the patient
must come first.
 I know Molly's needs, Sister!
She needs him.
 And worse, she wants him.
 She thinks he loves her, I can tell.
 Whenever he's in the room,
her eyes follow him.
 Like a dog's eyes. It's pitiful.
 Nurse, we're not here to pity!
We are here to serve.
 A man may beat his wife with a stick
no bigger than his thumb.
 It is enshrined in statute, and
occasionally cited in the courts.
 Sister,
are you sure that's still the case?
 He is entitled to do it
if she cuckolds him,
 insults his beard,
or wishes pain upon his teeth.
 I am reminded of the latter
 because my own molars have been
a source of some discomfort.
 And we are faced with
ginger nuts again.
 You are apprised of my method,
Sister. I await your permission.
 Of course.
 No more gas
and air at home deliveries.
 I've had it out with Dr Turner,
and he has conceded defeat.
 Surely not? Women have been begging
for gas and air!
 And you have absolutely no
business giving in to them!
 Doctor's been prevented from seeing
half his patients.
 He's just sat at his desk,
and his face was grey.
 I'm sorry, Sister, but it's 1958.
Women want pain relief.
 Good management of labour is
not about medical folderols.
 It is about care, and making sure
the woman feels supported.
 Besides, we already carry pethidine.
 And nitrous oxide simply
isn't practical.
 If you ask me, Dr Turner's
completely over-reached himself.
 Has anyone else noticed a button's
come off his clinical coat?
 He's got no-one to sew
it on for him.
 It hardly inspires confidence!
 Ugh, and his poor little boy's
looking quite unkempt.
 Speak more respectfully of
Doctor, please.
 And I'll thank you to hand me
the malt loaf.
 Anything exciting?
 I was just reading Situations
Vacant, for old time's sake.
 It takes me right back to my
otherwise entirely ghastly youth,
 dreaming of Africa,
and the missions.
 There's a six month posting here,
to Sierra Leone.
 Just my cup of tea,
once upon a time.
 Will you test me
on the Prostitution Laws?
 You can recite
the Prostitution Laws in your sleep!
 I can recite them in my sleep.
 That's the point.
I'm aiming for promotion.
 No point in ambitions,
if you don't try to achieve them.
 No. I don't suppose there is.
 Now, shall we begin with
importuning?
 Or do you want to ring the changes
with procurement?
 Molly, are you there?
 Please open the door, Molly.
 Ritchie said
I had to leave the bolt on.
 Molly, in the next few days,
you're going to have a baby.
 And you are going to need help,
and I think you know that.
 What should I do,
when the baby comes?
 You must telephone Nonnatus House.
That's Poplar, 459.
 We've arranged for you to have the
baby in the Maternity Home.
 What about Lorraine?
 You mustn't leave her alone.
 I never leave her alone.
 I love him.
 But I know him.
 And I love her.
 Of course you do.
 You could ask your mother to
look after her.
 Molly!
 Molly!

 Chips?
 I swear one day, if ever
I go a long, way away from here,
 this is the smell that would have me
sobbing hot tears of nostalgia.
 Sarson's malt,
and a dash of printer's ink.
 You aren't going a long, long
way away are you?
 Gosh, no. Honeymoon in Ramsgate.
 That was enough to
quench my wanderlust.
 Besides, I've a pack of wolf cubs
to keep in order.
 No, this is home now.
 Wherever I went,
 I'd wing my way back
here like a bally racing pigeon.
 Home. Heart is. All of that.
 The heart ends up making its home
in some very peculiar places,
 if you ask me.
 Are you talking
about Molly Brignall?
 I've never loved a brutal man.
 I've loved a wrong one.
 It was so hard to break away, and
for Molly that would be even harder.
 I'm not sure
she could find the courage.
 Gosh. Courage. Wish we could bottle
it, like gas and air.
 Sister Evangelina wouldn't approve.
 Oh, Lord. You did it.
You got new specs!
 My prescription had to be revised,
so it did seem justified.
 The frames really do suit you.
 They're much
lighter than your old pair.
 Oh, it's not the colour.
It's absolutely the upsweep.
 Opens the peepers wider than three
coats of mascara.
 Do come and look
at Sister Bernadette's glasses!
 They could only be
improved by diamante on the arms.
 I don't think you can get
diamante on the National Health.
 Are they on the National Health?
Oh, go on. Indulge me.
 What do you think?
 I take it the upswept frame
and I are not soul mates?
 Sister. It is time to partake with
the privilege of silence.
 I'm off.
 I'll bring you back a Babycham.
If you're good.
 I'm always good.
 So come here, and give us a kiss.
 No. You come here.
 Nah.
 And I want to hear that bolt go on.
 Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking.
 Camilla? It's me.
 Mr Impertinence. We're both on duty.
I'm just off on a house call.
 Listen, we've had a call from the
West India Dock night watchman.
 'It seems there's a woman in
labour, on a ship..
 Passenger ship?
 No, cargo.
 Cargo? Women aren't
permitted on cargo ships.
 I have to say,
I don't much like the sound of it.
 Who's on call?
Trixie.
 Don't send her on her own.
Fetch Jenny. Quickly.
 Mum!
 Molly?
 Still think it may be some
sort of a ruse.
 We could end up being robbed
till we're floating
 face down in the docks.
 Come on now,
all the nice girls love a sailor.
 'Nonnatus House. Midwife speaking.'
 It's Molly Brignall's mother. I'm
bringing her to the Maternity Home.
 I'm sorry, Trixie.
I need to go to Molly.
 But you've already said
you'll come with me!
 Molly needs to be with
somebody she trusts.
 And I don't need to be with
Sister Evangelina!
 Who alerted the night watchman?
 It was this gentleman,
Sister Evangelina.
 He's the captain of the ship you can
see across the river.
 Ah. Well, I shan't waste my breath
asking you a straight question.
 Because I won't get a
straight answer.
 My English has limits.
Mitt sprak ar Svenska.
 German. No sprachen,
you're out of luck.
 The ship's sailing under
the Swedish flag, Sister.
 No sprachen Swedish either.
 Has anyone inspected this
man's papers?
 Nurse. This is no time to play
the shrinking violet.
 It just seems rather irregular.
 How... is... the... mother?
 Ah.
 Very great scream.
Every five minutes.
 That regular enough for you?
 Follow me.
 I thought it would be more
like a hospital.
 No, not at all.
 Dr Turner's in charge,
and the midwives deliver the babies,
 just as they would
if you were at home.
 Will you deliver mine?
 Of course. That's why I'm here.
 I've never been on an ocean-going
vessel in my life.
 Just shake your golden curls.
Pretend it's the Good Ship Lollipop.
 But how do they get us on board?
 Probably just winch this boat up.
Be a piece of cake.
 Very well.
 And now, follow me.
 I'm sorry. I'm not really
dressed for gymnastics.
 Pull yourself together. No-one's
going to be looking up your drawers!
 Um, er, important! We have bags.
 Come!
 I won't waste my breath saying
"after you."
 You can touch up your lipstick
while you're waiting.
 My arm!
 Leave me be! Leave me be!
 Oh, Lord.
 If I've ever given you
the impression that
 I don't believe in you,
I absolutely promise that I do now.
 I did it!
 One curtain call only,
your bouquet's in the post.
 Auf Wiedersehen. Frauleins only!
 Shutsen!
 I am so happy to see some
other women!
 Men, they don't know anything.
Me, I don't know much.
 You don't need to know anything.
Now we're here.
 I'm Sister Evangelina,
and this is Nurse Franklin.
 I'm Kirsten.
 What a pretty name!
Kirsten, now then.
 Let's have a little look, shall we?
 Well, baby looks nice and cosy.
 But I can't be expecting.
 Pinard, if you would Nurse.
 Obese. We're in for shenanigans,
mark my words.
 Yes. Yes, a heartbeat.
 A baby?
 Kicking away to beat the band.
 A baby?
 Yes, of course.
 Are you certain?
 Yes, and a good thing too, I didn't
fancy taking out your appendix.
 My father said it was a baby.
 He remembered my mother's cries,
when she gave birth to me.
 Your father?
 He's the captain.
My mother died many years ago.
 I want her examined internally
without delay.
 Yes, Sister. How am
I going to access the birth canal?
 She's wedged into that
bunk like a sardine!
 I'm sorry to have to break
this to you, Nurse,
 but you're just going to have to
use your common sense.
 Sorry, sweetheart.
 I really need to put you
somewhere comfy,
 where you can lie on your back
with your legs apart.
 Would you tell that to my father?
 It wasn't so bad
when he first brought me on board,
 but there's more flesh to me
now than it was then.
 I have had men slide right off my
body, and fall onto the floor.
 Men?
 The sailors.
 I see.
 My father always says there is no
fighting on a ship
 when the crew have a woman they
can go to for relief.
 He's got it all organised,
hasn't he?
 He thinks of everything.
You feel under my pillow.
 Go on.
 What an absolutely enormous
amount of contraceptive sheaths.
 My father has never, ever,
let me run out of rubbers
 and I'm free from disease and...
 and I cannot get pregnant.
 Help me up.
 Your daughter, mein Herren, must be
removed to a decent cabin.
 She needs clean bed, hot water,
bright lights, soap and towels.
 Comprendez? And if he doesn't
comprendez, do you?
 There's nae need to holler at me.
I'm fae Glasgow.
 Sister.
 I don't know you've done to yourself
but I want you on that chair now.
 I've dislocated my shoulder.
 I can feel the displacement,
and I can't move my arm.
 I've a jolly good mind to
give you pethidine.
 The pethidine is for the patient!
 And we'll have a bottle of brandy
while you're about it!
 I saw a horse have a foal when
I was in the country.
 Did you?
 I sat on the gate with my brother,
and I watched it happen.
 They don't do it like we do, horses.
They stay standing.
 Or that one did.
 As though it liked
the feeling of the sun on its back.
 It's all right.
 Try not to bite your lip, Molly.
You'll make it bleed.
 It don't hurt.
 It didn't hurt the horse,
it just stood there.
 Kirsten.
 Tak, Fader.
 Du fortjanar det.
 If I deserve it,
why did you wait until now?
 Thank you, Captain. Raus.
 I'll take over from here.
 Not too late for the gas
and air, Molly. Nothing! Sure?
 Gosh. Plenty of room in here!
 Sister. Sister!
 What?
 I think we've got
a prankster on our hands.
 It appears to have pushed its cord
into the birth canal.
 Prolapsed? I'm not actually sure.
I've never had to deal with one.
 Well, you're just going to
have to stay calm,
 and remember what you were
taught in training!
 In training, they said a Caesarean
section may be needed!
 Well, we haven't got that luxury.
 You need her on her knees,
with her head on her forearms
 and her bottom in the air.
 If I got her into that position,
she wouldn't be able to sustain it!
 Well, you've to get the cord
out of the way!
 If the baby's head crushes
it on the way down,
 it will stop the oxygen,
and it might die.
 You look worried.
 Oh no, that's just my silent
sympathetic glance.
 On your feet.
 What? I need your chair.
 What you going to do?
Put your feet up!
 Not my feet, Sister. Her pelvis.
Trust me, Sister.
 You look like a lion tamer.
 Frankly, Sister Evangelina,
taming a lion would be preferable.
 Now, would you
like some more brandy?
 No, thank you. I am replete.
Then I'll proceed.
 Sweetie, can you raise your bottom.
 As far as you can.
 Taking as much weight
on your shoulders as possible.
 Like what...?
 It's all very well playing
tricks with gravity,
 but how's she actually going to
deliver in that position?
 I think a boat went past.
 Unless it has an obstetrician on it,
that's of no interest to me!
 And Sister!
 I asked you to trust me, because
if you don't, I won't trust myself!
 And Kirsten won't trust me either.
 Yes, I am. I trust you.
 I trust you.
 Ready, sweetie?
 I am going to press very
hard on your baby's head,
 but you need to stay exactly
where you are.
 Ya!
 Feel for the pubic bone
with your left hand!
 I'm feeling for it!
 It's here. It's here.
 Keep up the external pressure.
 What if I tear the sac?
 You won't tear the sac, because
we're not going to lose this baby.
 There really ought to be some
sort of a fanfare.
 The cord's slipped back, and I can't
feel anything but the baby's head.
 Lift up now, sweetie.
 I'm wetting the bed!
 No. Your waters have broken.
 And you're now in the perfect
position for delivery.
 Let's just put him
on your chest a moment.
 Ritchie wanted a boy.
Hope he's got his father's eyes.
 If he was like that little foal,
he'd be up on his legs
 and running around in a minute.
 All through the flowers
and the grass.
 I imagine he would.
 My mum says to me,
"Moll, you shouldn't romanticise.
 "You shouldn't always go seeing
the beauty where there's none!"
 But if I didn't, then,
what would there be to see?
 Come along, young madam.
 It's a girl? It's a girl!
 Shake a leg. It's your birthday!
 It's in shock. You'll have to smack
it on the backside.
 No! Don't touch her!
 There's no need to hurt her.
She's doing it all for herself.

 You've made the crew very happy.
 I always make them happy.
It is my job.
 Well, if you intend to
continue in this vein,
 you'll have to sort
your contraception out.
 All of that can wait.
 I have lived without
friendship for such a long time.
 But today, you came.
 And she came, too.
 So now I have a friend for ever.
 Hey, miss.
 There, there, little 'un.
Don't make a sound.
 Don't stroke my head!
 Nurse.
 You have, um, gratitude from me.
 And you'll have gratitude from me,
sir, when you have a boat waiting
 for me, at the quay, at noon,
every day, for the next two weeks.
 Nej, uh... I cannot do that.
You have no choice.
 Your exploitation of your daughter
has been shameful.
 And it's as easy for me
to report you to the police
 as it was for you to call
and ask for help.
 Oh.
 My shift's not over until I've seen
you safely into hospital.
 Make yourself useful.
Pass me the gas and air.
 Neighbour saw her coming
back this morning,
 with the newborn in her arms.
 Molly? Are you at home?
 It's very dangerous,
to discharge yourself from care!
 Welcome home! Do you want to
meet your little brother?
 Yeah!
 Yeah? Come on, let's go find him, eh?
Come here!
 I'd do anything for her.
 I know.
 She'd do anything for him.
 I can't even tell you the things
that people say.
 Ignore them, Mrs Gray.
You know your own daughter.
 Yeah. I do. I wish I could
turn back the clock.
 If I'd been a better mother,
I could reach her now.
 It's Molly whose
skills are in doubt. Not yours.
 It's all part
and parcel of the same.
 I made a mess of everything.
 'I called at Molly's flat each day,
but the door was never opened.
 'It seemed she'd locked herself
away in what she thought was love.
 'The truth was worse,
though I didn't know it.
 'In thrall to her husband, Molly was
leaving her children alone,
 'dosed with milk and alcohol
so they didn't cry.
 'We knew nothing of her actions
until disaster struck.'
 Please, let me through!
 Left on her own.
 There's another one! A newborn.
 Another one!
 'In court, the couple were
convicted of child neglect.
 'They were both imprisoned.'
 Looks like it was
started by a fag end.
 'And that was the end of Molly's
journey as a parent.'
 'Meanwhile, Trixie, permitted now to
go to work in slacks,
 'helped another mother to make
a better start.
 'Pushed to her limits,
she had flourished
 'and with her support
so did the Captain's daughter.'
 A little goodbye present.
Not gift-wrapped, I'm afraid.
 It's from the National Health.
 I'm Swedish.
 I pulled strings.
 And these are a very
reputable brand,
 they won't fail
you like the last lot did.
 I don't need them.
 Well. Not this week, one would hope.
 I'm going back to Stockholm.
 I will live on land,
and walk on grass.
 And she will walk on grass,
and her bed will be her own.
 Has the captain agreed to it?
 I didn't ask him. I told him.
 And I would like to say he said
yes because he loves me.
 But I think it's
because he's ashamed of himself.
 I think he saw himself
through your eyes.
 I saw myself through your eyes.
And I was pathetic.
 No. No. You were magnificent.
 I wasn't then.
 But I am a mother now.
 Liten flicka.
 'Love cannot ease every anguish
in the world but tenderly applied,
 'it can transfigure fortunes,
light up faces. Turn the tide.'
 'Molly's children went to live
with their grandmother,
 'who bought an immaculate pram
on hire purchase,
 'investing in the future,
whilst turning back the clock.
 'Her spotless house became
a happy home again,
 'centred on a baby boy
and a little girl.
 'There was pain,
but she could bear it.
 'For her journey had come
full circle.
 'They were her second chance
at love.
 'And she was theirs.'
 Do you understand what a very great
step you are about to take?
 Absolutely,
and I'm utterly terrified.
 Hello, stranger. Oh, my gosh, Jenny.
 What happened?
I did everything I could.
 You understand
we have to ask these questions?
 Constable Noakes,
am I being accused of something?
