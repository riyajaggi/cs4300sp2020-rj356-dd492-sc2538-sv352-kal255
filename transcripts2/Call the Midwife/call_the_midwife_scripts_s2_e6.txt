 MUSIC: "Secretly"
by Jimmie Rodgers
 SHE SIGHS
 # Why must I meet you
 # In a secret rendezvous?
 # Why must we steal away
 # To steal a kiss or two?
 # Why must we wait to do
 # The things we want to do?
 # Why? Oh, why?
 # Oh, why? Oh, why? Oh, why? #
 MATURE JENNY: 'As nurses
and midwives,
 'we were adept of silence.
 'We shared much with those
we cared for
 'and saw more
than we could ever say.'
 KNOCK ON DOOR
 'But we had secrets
and burdens of our own.
 'Who could we turn to
 'when our hearts were full?
 'Who could reassure us
when we were afraid?'
 Where are you off to,
Sister Monica Joan?
 I am going to chapel,
 as I do numerous times a day,
every day.
 Routine is man's saviour, Fred.
 It's just that you're not wearing
your habit, Sister Monica Joan.
 I most certainly am!
 Not a thread.
 Easily done.
 No.
 I would never make my pilgrimage
to chapel without...
 Would you not breathe a word?
 There would be utterances.
 Of course.
 Thank you, Fred.
 That'll be the fourth time today,
Miss Masterson.
 You must be drinking
too much tea in the morning.
 I'm sorry, Mrs Flynn.
 Go. I don't want a puddle.
 Thank you.
 60 seconds. One alligator,
two alligator, three alligator...
 SHE SIGHS
 Comfortable there, Mrs Tate?
 I bet you didn't think you'd get
that cape finished before baby came.
 Oh, Nurse, you'd think
I'd know the difference
 between a false alarm
and the real thing by now.
 I've only done it five times before.
 SHE COUGHS
 That's a nasty cough.
 Had it for ages. It'll pass.
 SHE COUGHS
 I'm going to fetch Doctor.
 BELL TINKLES
 Mrs Tate is my third case this week.
 Which says to me,
we have a new epidemic on our hands.
 Doctor, TB has never been choosy.
 It's everywhere in Poplar.
Always has been.
 Not this bad. Not in my time.
 Sister, I'm getting there too late.
 You can't know
they have the disease.
 Unless they are screened. Early.
 The Mass X-ray Programme?
 It's coming, but who knows when?
 We need that van now.
 Heavens, we are the most
over-populated corner of London!
 Indeed. And these are the cases
we can see.
 I've asked to see the board,
 and I shall try to make a case
for a van to come to Poplar
 as a matter of urgency.
 You have the full support
of Nonnatus House, Doctor.
 Whatever you need.
 It's worth a try.
 Got my letter, then?
 You a slow reader or something?
 I came as soon as I could.
 Prepare yourself.
 HE MURMURS
 Terry?
 It's Julia, Dad.
 Who?
 Julia.
 Your daughter.
 Well, well, well.
 Heard you were under the weather.
 Illness always flushes out
the guilty.
 I wanted to see you.
 Like your mother.
 Hopeless liar.
 What's the doctor said?
 No doctors.
 You still working in that pub?
 No. I went to college.
 I got a job at a typing pool.
 Typing pool?
 Downhill all the way, then.
 Something like that.
 You need to see a doctor, Dad.
 You need proper care.
 Don't you come in here,
all Miss La-De-Bloody-Da,
 after six years of nothing,
and tell me what I need.
 I thought it was five. It's six.
 Six.
 You'll be wanting to get off.
 You're outrageous!
 SHE CHUCKLES
 They're wildly uncomfortable,
but I don't care a jot.
 Where on earth did you get those?
 SHE CHUCKLES
 Dolcis. Do they make me
walk like Marilyn Monroe?
 You'd have to chop
a bit of that heel off.
 Is that how she does it??
 Quarter of an inch.
 I read it in Woman's Realm.
Helps with the wiggle.
 SHE CHUCKLES
 Right. Where's Fred?
 You can't chop the heel off
a brand new pair of shoes!
 Fred!
If it's good enough for Marilyn...!
 Somebody call?
 Can you lop a quarter of an inch
off that heel, Fred?
 You'd be wrecking them!
 Well, it's all in the name
of an improved wiggle.
 They're brand spanking new!
 SHE SIGHS
 All right, you win.
 I don't know how you can walk
in those things.
 I'd feel a bit vertiginous myself.
 Ah, Fred does hate heights.
 THEY CHUCKLE
 Oi. Knock, knock. Why haven't you
ordered gin?
 It's August, Terry.
 Think. Women drink twice as much
when their kids are off school.
 Crawling all over them.
 HE GASPS
 Good job I'm hanging on, innit?
 HE GASPS
 Keeping an eye on my castle...
 Terry, get down here, will you?!
 There's someone here for the Master.
 Don't you go running off.
 HE CHUCKLES
 HE GASPS
 Follow me.
 Good evening, Mr Masterson.
 I will not have doctors in my pub!
 Lost your blinkin' memory, have you?
 Who called you? I did.
 I told her, sir.
 She needs the inside and the outside
of her head examining.
 Your wrist, please?
 Too tired.
 Your pulse is fast.
 I'd just like to examine your neck.
 Just tip your head to the right.
 What are you looking at?
 That's it.
 And your legs?
 Swollen.
 Could you lean forward a little?
 I need to check your back.
 Lean right forward
if you can manage.
 We need to get this sore dressed.
 Are you comfortable here?
At the pub?
 Perfectly.
 What? Doctor, he can't stay here.
 I disagree.
 To move him now might have
 a detrimental effect.
 But he needs to be in hospital.
No! You need me to be in hospital.
 So then you can get out of there.
 Miss Masterson,
your father needs somebody here.
 He needs constant care.
 I can stay tonight.
 A nurse will be with you tomorrow.
 Miss Masterson, your father may need
you for more than one night.
 It's not possible.
 I was only planning
to be here for an hour.
 I have a job. A life.
 I certainly will be leaving tomorrow.
 He'll do very well without me.
 Let me be clear.
 I believe his heart attack two years
ago caused irreversible damage.
 Had he attended his appointments
or been open to advice,
 we may have been able
to slow down this process.
 What process?
 The care that I am offering
is palliative care.
 His heart is failing.
 Your father is dying.
 I see.
 As I said, I can stay tonight.
 Thank you for coming.
 Who's pinched all the clamps?
 Sorry, not guilty.
 Well, they must have grown legs
and marched off by themselves.
 I am covering appointments
for Sister Julienne this morning.
 And shall be making a trip to
County Hall with Doctor Turner.
 Cynthia, could you take another
maternity pack to the Skevingtons
 as their pet mouse appears to have
nibbled their last one? Yes, Sister.
 Nurse Lee, it's said Mr Masterson
has a slight manner about him.
 But I know you can manage
the tricky ones without help.
 Thank you. Toughening up, I hope.
 You've learnt much, Nurse.
 You should be proud of yourself.
 Clamp thief!
 Sister Bernadette.
 Doctor Turner.
 I... I was expecting Sister Julienne.
 Sister Julienne has been called out.
I am covering for her.
 I see.
 I'm sorry I'm a little late.
 I couldn't find a decent tie.
 That tie seems
perfectly...appropriate.
 Thank you.
 I do appreciate your support today.
 I am here as a favour
to Sister Julienne. That is all.
 Of course.
 CAR ENGINE STARTS
 The nurse is here, Dad.
 Mr Masterson, I'm Nurse Lee.
 I'm here to give you an injection,
 and to keep an eye on your legs,
and check the sore on your shoulder.
 Oh, goody gumdrops.
 I'll be coming in every morning,
early, to get you clean,
 tidy and comfortable.
 I'll leave you to it.
 Oh, you don't have to.
Do stay if you want to.
 She doesn't.
 Have you got children, Nurse?
 No, I haven't.
 Lucky old you.
 SHE SIGHS
 I'm sure you don't mean that.
 Children are everything.
 You don't know, do you, Nurse?
 I lost all my children...
 Dad!
 ..to TB.
 But you still have your daughter?
 Yes... God chose carefully that day.
 Left me with an icy cold wind.
 DOOR CLOSES
 Surely the two of you must be close?
 How little you know, Nurse.
 I lost my wife.
 My five sons.
 One, then another, then another.
 Good Lord.
 It was my youngest, Elizabeth,
so happy, so tiny.
 On her fourth birthday,
she just started coughing and...
 HE GASPS
 ..slipped away.
 Julia and I were left quite alone.
 How dreadful for you both.
 She kept the light on for me,
kept me sane.
 And she left, just went suddenly.
 Wanted to make a life for herself,
away from this pub.
 HE GASPS
 That girl thinks of herself.
 That is all.
 I'm sure that's not true.
 Oh, it is, Nurse.
 Even now, she can't wait
to get out that door!
 HE GASPS
 DOOR CLOSES
 Miss Masterson, are you leaving?
 He'll manage without me.
 From what Mr Masterson told me,
 I would understand
if you wanted to run.
 I can't stay in this pub.
 You're all he has left.
 He's your father
 and he's still here.
 SHE SIGHS
 You all right? You look faint.
 I'm not the patient, Nurse Lee.
 Miss Masterson,
forgive me for asking...
 Are you expecting a child?
 Am I wrong?
 The office will lay me off
if I'm discovered.
 I can't afford not to work.
 I certainly didn't want him knowing.
 How far gone are you?
 Eight months.
 Eight months? You're tiny.
 It must be the girdle.
 The baby will be totally restricted!
It's terribly dangerous.
 Is there a fiance?
 No.
 I was hoping my wedding bouquet might
have been a bit bigger than most,
 but...it happens, doesn't it?
 I was about to tell
Frank about the baby,
 when he told me he was marrying
his sweetheart.
 It's funny.
I thought I was his sweetheart.
 Can you lie down on the bed, please?
 Nurse, I had to wear it.
 I need my job.
 I understand. I do.
 But this can't go back on.
 Promise?
 Sir, with respect,
 we need an X-ray van in Poplar now.
 While the disease remains
undetected, patients will die.
 Patients do die sometimes, Dr Turner.
 I would say that was
an occupational hazard.
 Sir, I have just diagnosed a heavily
pregnant patient with advanced TB.
 She has five children.
 She might well die,
because I didn't know she was ill.
 You know that TB need no longer be
a death sentence.
 We can treat it.
 But we have to get in early
 so people have the chance
to recover.
 We don't seem to be making
much ground here, do we?
 We are stating, plainly,
 that this is a highly complex,
logistical programme.
 The vans ARE coming to London.
 Where to?
 Mayfair? Chelsea?
 What, pray, are you suggesting?
 Have you ever been to Poplar?
 No.
 In Poplar, we might have
up to a dozen people
 living in one small house
or tenement flat.
 When conditions are over-crowded
and unventilated,
 infection spreads with ease.
 Meanwhile, someone who is infected
unwittingly takes the disease
 to an over-crowded production line
and transmits it to his colleagues.
 And even if they re-infected
just 20 fellow workers a year,
 which would be a very
conservative estimate,
 that means 20 whole families
exposed to the disease.
 Including children!
 So, while you plan
your "highly complex programme",
 the disease is travelling.
 We can fight it,
 but we do need that van now.
 Right.
 Doctor Turner and Sister Bernadette
have made their point.
 We shall have to give this
some consideration.
 Congratulations, Dr Turner.
You were really quite tremendous.
 As were you, Sister.
 I wish I had been there.
It sounds terribly dramatic.
 Doctor Turner sounds
like he was quite the hero.
 Quite.
 I'm deeply grateful to
you for stepping in, Sister.
 You more than deserve
the last Scotch egg.
 DOORBELL RINGS
 Be a fat lot of work.
 We're already stretched
to full pelt as it is.
 If anyone is not prepared to work,
let them not eat.
 'Good evening. This way, Doctor.
Thank you.'
 When you speak of the sun,
so it shines.
 I'm sorry to interrupt,
but felt I must come at once.
 They are sending a van to Poplar
a week next Tuesday.
 ALL: Oh!
 That is truly marvellous news.
 Wonderful!
 And so, the gamma-rays
enter our galaxy.
 Hang on a giddy minute.
 They're sending a van on the day
of the Antenatal Clinic?
 Indeed. Not wholly convenient.
 Yes. Well, we shall just have
to manage.
 I'd like to know how.
 Sister Evangelina
could control the masses.
 She has a voice somewhat
reminiscent of a...
 foghorn!
 THEY CHUCKLE
 BICYCLE BELL TINKLES
 Right, Mr Masterson.
 We're going to see if any
of this fluid is reducing today.
 Ooh, you spoil me, Nurse Lee.
 HE CHUCKLES
 I'll leave you to it.
 There she goes again.
 Little Miss Selfish
with her own fish to fry...
 Just stop. Stop. I can't stand it.
 My family died too! Remember?
 I couldn't stay here.
 So selfish.
 No, I'm not.
 I couldn't stand being near you!
 Could we have some calm, please?
 Good.
 Now, Miss Masterson,
I'm going to teach you
 how to give your father
some lymphatic massage.
 It will help with the build-up
of fluid,
 and take the pressure off his heart.
 So, if I'm not here,
you can help relieve him.
 And lift...
 No, I don't think I should.
 It will really help.
 I'd prefer if you did it, Nurse.
 Oh, for goodness' sake! You're both
as bad as each other! Now, come on.
 It'll be over before you know it.
 Now, Miss Masterson,
 would you place your hands
on your father's ankle, like this?
 Go on.
 And push up towards the knee.
 Bottom to top.
 Firmer than that.
 Hopeless.
 Mr Masterson,
could you refrain from speaking
 while we do our work, please?
Thank you.
 Off you go.
 Grasp the ankle
 and push up firmly towards the knee.
 And again.
 Keep going.
 SHE SIGHS
 And again.
 Good, now the other one.
 Do the same again, firm movements.
 That's it.
 Good. And rest.
 Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?
 Excuse me.
 I won't let her leave.
 You did that on purpose, didn't you?
 I don't know what you mean.
 About that baby of yours,
 I'd like you to come
for an antenatal appointment.
 I can't.
 That baby is coming out
 and the sooner you come to terms
with that, the better.
 This isn't how I wanted it to be.
 I wanted to come back one day,
 show him that I'd made something
of myself.
 Make him proud.
 I haven't got a hope in hell
of that now.
 Maybe he will feel some shame.
 But this would be
his first grandchild.
 That's quite a legacy
to give a dying man.
 There's an Antenatal and Baby Clinic
tomorrow at the Parish Hall.
 Come.
 She'd better come. Otherwise,
I'll pop her in a wheelbarrow
 and push her down there myself.
 Ow! Sorry!
 You could leave my hair in pins
for a week
 and it would still be
poker-straight.
 I'm destined never to curl.
 But, at least, you'll have a scalp,
Cynthia. I presently do not.
 Heaven knows what
Mr Masterson will say
 when he finds out she's pregnant.
 In a fix and unmarried, she'll
certainly be the talk of the pub.
 Do you think there'll be
an awful scene?
 I bet he loves her really.
Love without question.
 That's what makes the world go round.
 Ow!
 Sorry, Trixie. Beauty is pain!
 Just wait until I do your hair,
Jenny Lee!
 Death by hairpins!
 SHE LAUGHS
 Won't catch me going anywhere
near that X-ray van.
 Rotten for baby's health,
apparently.
 Rumours are not to be believed.
 X-rays are extremely low-risk
to an established pregnancy.
 Indeed, you are putting
your child at greater risk
 by not having the X-ray.
 Oh, dear.
 I fear we may need to up
our game a little. Indeed.
 Miss Masterson!
 Welcome. You look well.
 I feel like a trolleybus.
 This way.
 Julia, are you sure you're
only eight months?
 I'd put you more at nine.
Your baby feels low.
 It was Christmas Eve.
 I'm not going to forget
that in a hurry.
 Too much port and ginger
with Frank down The Cock And Bull.
 It couldn't have been earlier?
 No, I don't think so...
 Oh!
 Frank took me to a bonfire night.
 Bloody Catherine wheels were
popping in the field behind us.
 Fireworks.
 No more fireworks now.
 Any day now, then.
 Nurse Lee?
 Yes?
 I hope you don't mind me asking,
 does your father...approve of you?
 I think so.
 He was a little testy
when I moved to Poplar,
 but he's getting used to the idea.
 I often think about what it would be
like to have a proper father.
 One that cares.
 Miss Masterson,
he lost everything apart from you.
 So I would say that, to him,
you are most precious.
 Most precious indeed.
 Dad?
 Brought you some porridge.
 You can get rid of that flower
for a start.
 It'll only get knocked over.
 I remember you shovelling porridge in
when I was little.
 Sitting at the bar.
All over that account book.
 You counting out
the bottles on the abacus.
 HE GASPS
 You were good.
 Well trained.
 Got to keep an eye on the accounts.
 Trust nobody.
 Apart from family, maybe.
 Oh, God, don't look at me like that.
 What?
 SHE SIGHS
 Dad...
 You think I haven't noticed?
 You got anyone?
 He went.
 I'll knock his bleedin' block off.
 I'm so sorry, Dad.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry it was only me left.
 I'm sorry I wasn't Mum
or Elizabeth or the boys.
 It was me.
 I'm sorry for being the one
who didn't die.
 What consolation
could I ever possibly be?
 Julia...
 It's just...
 I needed you...and you went.
 And I needed my dad.
 I lost six of my babies.
 I lost them too.
 I have a broken heart, love.
 I do.
 HE GASPS
 What have I done to you? Dad...
 HE GASPS
 We're very alike, you and me.
 I saw that in you, very early on.
 Stubborn, strong...
 Never one to back down.
 When's your little one due?
 Any day.
 D'you know what you're going to do?
 You could stay here.
 Please stay.
 Have the baby here.
 I should like to be able
to hold my grandchild.
 I'd like that very much.
 All right.

 Morning, Sister.
 Ah, the X-ray cards.
Let me help you.
 Thank you, Sister.
 Oh. I do think we've been sent
rather too many.
 Oh, I don't think so.
 I think we can expect
great things from today.
 I'm pleased to see your optimism.
 You have a little spring
back in your step again, Sister.
 I am glad.
 If people come today, so many lives
and future lives will be saved.
 Indeed.
 Shall we?
 It's here!
 Oh, Lord!
 It's big, isn't it?
 I'll be able to see my little one
inside me!
 I can't wait.
 Me too.
 Do you think people will come?
 Oh, I hope so. I really do.
 Bloody hell.
 Excuse me. Excuse me.
 You might want to put
that crossword away, Doctor.
 But I've only got one left.
 Clue is "launch".
Begins with K, two words,
 second word ends with F.
 Kick off.
 Sister Monica Joan?
 Sister? Our X-ray appointment
is today, remember?
 The door is quite jammed.
 Oh, my.
 'I shall not be attending
any such X-ray machine...'
 I am in my Ark.
 There is no point in pushing, sir!
 I shall not topple that easily!
 I shall say it again.
 Form a queue!
 Oh! That means, one,
 and then one behind,
then another one,
 that's right,
and you, stay like that!
 Excuse me. Thank you.
 Have you never queued for a bus,
madam?
 Good morning, Doctor.
 Sister Bernadette.
 The posters worked, then.
 Never in my wildest dreams.
 A queue does mean a queue. Please!
 All right, good morning, everyone.
 ALL: Good morning!
 Now, you will only be in the van
a matter of moments.
 After we've taken your snap shot,
you will be handed your X-ray,
 which you must then give
to Sister Bernadette here,
 along with your name
and address card.
 Are you all right there, Sister?
 Oh, yes, Doctor. I was born
for days like this. Oi, you!
 Stand back, I say!
 Ah, Dr McGuinness, Sister Bernadette
will be helping us today.
 Marvellous. Good to know
the Lord will be with us!
 Ah, Fred, thank goodness.
 Where's Sister Julienne?
 Gone.
 Sister Monica Joan's
stuck in the bathroom.
 And we're due at the X-ray van
for our screening.
 Sister Monica Joan?
Are you all right?
 'Tickety-boo, thank you, Fred.'
 Are you?
 I'm going to try the door.
Stand back!
 Oh.
 WOOD CREAKS
 Ow!
 HE MOANS
 'All this thrashing about...'
 when I am quite comfortably
settled in my Ark, Fred.
 'I am quite immovable.'
 Just get in there!
Don't want to!
 Just do it! No!
 Can I help?
 You won't be able to do nothing.
 She's just doing it to show me up.
 I tell you what.
 I don't want to go in there, either.
 Shall we make a pact?
 If you go in, I'll go in.
 Good.
 May I, Doctor?
 Of course.
 Come along.
 Thank you.
 She's only little.
 You're a natural.
 Please.
 I'll hold your ladder.
 Sister Monica Joan, can you hear me?
 'Hear no evil, speak no evil,
see no evil!'
 Well, have no fear.
Fred's coming up.
 We'll get you out of there.
 Er...
 HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
 Just one tiny thing. I...
 I have a little problem
with heights.
 I see.
 Ordinarily, I'd be sympathetic,
Fred.
 But today, I'm not. What?
 Come on, up you go.
It won't take a minute.
 I can't! Up!
 Don't look down!
 Oh, oh!
 HE MOANS
 HE PANTS
 Sister. Noah, being warned by God
about things not seen,
 prepared an Ark for the salvation
of his household.
 Behold, the gamma rays will bring
forth a flood to this earth
 which will destroy all flesh
in which is the breath of life.
 There will be no flood, Sister.
 But they did not understand
the power of the atomic poison
 until the floods came
and took them all away.
 Sister...
 ..I will bet on my life,
you need not your Ark.
 There's not a cloud in the sky.
 All is calm.
 And I will escort you
to and from the X-ray van,
 never leaving your side.
 How about that?
 Never once?
 Never.
 I appear to be in your debt, Fred.
 Shall we bring life belts?
 No need. I've got my paddle
sports activity badge.
 SHE SIGHS
 My rock and my fortress.
 Thank you, Fred.

 SHE GASPS
 Thank you, Sister.
You did wonderful work today.
 Forgive me, Doctor.
My glottis is a bit ragged.
 Doctor, could I have a word?
 Thank you for coming, Nurse.
 He's so breathless.
I didn't know what to do.
 His heartbeat's very fast.
 He might be taking
a turn for the worse.
 No. Not yet.
 He knows about the baby.
 He asked me to stay, Nurse.
 That's wonderful.
 Right, you massage his legs.
 Anything might help to relieve
the pressure on his heart.
 Today is a testament to you,
Doctor Turner.
 And to you, Sister.
I couldn't have done it without you.
 Everyone worked so terribly hard.
 Would you join us for a cup
of celebratory Horlicks?
 I won't, thank you, Sister.
 Might I see Sister Bernadette
in private?
 I have something
I need to discuss with her.
 Of course.
 DOOR CLOSES
 Dr Turner.
 Sister. Oh, what a day we had!
 Indeed.
 Is all well?
 Would you mind sitting?
 Of course.
 This has my name on it.
 Yes.
 The lesions are small.
 But there is more than one.
 I see.
 How many?
 Dr McGuinness counted nine or ten,
in the upper lobe.
 But, as you know,
this film is basic.
 You will need a more detailed
chest X-ray.
 Have you had any symptoms?
 No.
 Well, a little breathlessness,
maybe.
 No cough? No.
 Nothing.
 I will need to carry out
an examination.
 Yes.
 Breathe in.
 And out.
 And again.
 Crackles...
 ..on both sides.
 I've arranged an X-ray
for you in the morning.
 It might be more convenient
if I drive you.
 Thank you, Doctor.
 You don't need to do that.
 I'll drive you.
 His heart's a little calmer.
 He's hanging on.
 Thank you.
 Oh!
 SHE SIGHS
 HE GASPS
 I think Sister Monica Joan
has a soft spot for our Fred.
 THEY CHUCKLE
 If she had a soft spot for Fred,
 I don't think she'd have wanted him
up that ladder!
 Oh, poor Fred! His worst nightmare.
 Well, he got her out,
which is surely the main thing.
 I have something I need to tell you.
 The milk will help you sleep.
 Thank you, Sister.
 KNOCKING ON DOOR
 Sister, I'm sorry to disturb you.
 But Nurse Lee has asked for you
to come to The Masters Arms pub
at once.
 Miss Masterson has gone into labour,
 and Mr Masterson has taken
a turn for the worse.
 We will fetch Sister Evangelina
and ask her to go in my place.
 Sister, you must go.
 I don't wish you to be alone.
 Sister, if you continue
with your work as normal,
 then nothing will be out of sorts.
 Nothing will have changed.
 As you wish.
 MURMURING
 Excuse me. Sorry.
 I thought she looked
a bit pale this morning,
 but she wouldn't let me do anything.
 Just like her dad.
 FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING
 She woke with labour pains,
but didn't let on.
 Her waters have broken,
 but Mr Masterson's so fragile
she won't leave his side.
 Hot water's on its way!
 Thank you, Terry.
End of the corridor.
 SHE GASPS
 Miss Masterson, the baby's coming.
 We need to get you settled,
and monitor the baby's position.
 I'm not leaving him!
 Miss Masterson, I understand
you want your father
 to meet his grandchild?
 Yes.
 Then let's get this baby out.
 I'll stay with your father,
I promise he will not be alone.
 Don't you dare.
 Sister, are you all right?
 SHE SIGHS
 It has been rather a taxing day,
Nurse.
 Yes, it has.
 It's hot in here. Need some air.
 It's the pub. When it's busy,
it's like a furnace up here.
 We need to get you on the bed.
 All right?
 Let's get you on the bed.
 Well, you can't stay down there,
 you're having a baby,
 not sweeping the carpet.
 Let's have a listen, shall we?
 SHE GASPS
 A steady 1.30.
 That's what we like.
 You must be comfortable there.
 Do you feel any pressure?
 My word, Julia.
 SHE GASPS
 I think you're entering
the second stage of labour,
 which means your baby is on its way.
 Nurse Lee, would you check on Dad?
 All right, just for you.
 But, remember, we have a job to do.
 She's quiet,
but I think she's in transition.
 She's on her knees, Sister.
Won't move.
 Is she comfortable? Yes.
 That is the main thing.
 How is he?
 His heartbeat is weak. He's fading.
 It's a matter of time.
 Mr Masterson,
your daughter has gone into labour.
 You're about to have a grandchild.
 Thank you, Terry.
 Your father's still with us.
 Right, I know you want to push,
 but not quite yet.
 Slow and steady.
 That's it.
Your baby's really hurtling out now.
 SHE GASPS
 I can see the baby's head.
 Nice deep breaths.
 Concentrate on breathing
just like that. That's it.
 If you can hear me,
please hang on, Sir.
 Now, then.
 I want you to push but not too hard.
 Good, deep breaths.
 Another big push,
as hard as you can.
 And that lovely head
will be with us.
 Keep going!
 That's it.
 All right, Julia,
one more big push for me now.
 And it's here.
 SHE MOANS
 That's it, this one isn't wasting
any time. That's it!
 BABY CRIES
 A little boy.
 Oh, Lord, you are having a very,
very busy day.
 He's beautiful.
 BABY CRIES
 Can you take him straight to Dad?
 A boy.
 He's still breathing.
 Oh, thank goodness.
 The placenta still
needs to be delivered.
 Then back you go.
 Mr Masterson?
 Mr Masterson?
 A grandson, Mr Masterson.
 A boy?
 Yes.
 He appears to be rather perfect.
 Can I hold him?
 My grandson.
 I'm just leaving, I'm afraid.
 And you've just arrived.
 We're passing, you and...you and I.
 HE CHUCKLES
 I'm very pleased to meet you.
 Dad?
 You look after your mother.
 Don't have her doing the barrels.
 That's...that's your job.
 HE CHOKES
 SHE SOBS

 MATURE JENNY: 'The world is full
of love that goes unspoken.
 'It doesn't mean that it is felt
less deeply
 'or that separation
leaves a cleaner wound.
 'Its beauty...
 'and its pain are in its silence.'
 CAR ENGINE STARTS UP
 MUSIC: "Your Precious Love"
by Jerry Butler
 # Your precious love
 # Means more to me
 # Than any love
 # Could ever be
 # For when I wanted you
 # I was so lonely and so blue... #
 MATURE JENNY: 'The typed formal
lines of the Master's will,
 'spoke with greater eloquence
than he could do in life.
 'Drawn out during the years of
his estrangement from his daughter,
 'he'd left the thing he loved most,
his public house,
 'to the person he loved most,
his last surviving child.
 'And so the past was laid to rest.
 'And her future made secure.'
 # They say that our love won't grow
 # But I just wanna tell them
 # That they don't know... #
 The triple treatment
can be miraculous.
 We shall see.
 Thank you, Doctor.
 You've been more than kind.
 MATURE JENNY: 'Some of us
are not blessed
 'with revelations or confessions.
 'Love cannot be spoken, only shown.
 'And everything that makes
the heart beat must be hushed.'
 My mother has this china.
 Mine too.
 Come here, you hag of a woman!
 You stop this instant!
 Call the bloody midwife.
They don't answer.
 Ooh!
 Not too fast!
You don't know the machine.
 Whatever next, nuns on skis.
 Chummy!

 # Well, I know you heard
Of the Suzy-Q

Of the Chicken too
 # I know you heard
Of the Cha-cha-choo
 # Cos the Walk is a dance
That you can do
 # You just walk, you just walk
 # Oh, you walk
 # Yes, you walk... #
