 Call the Midwife (2012–…): Season 1, Episode 3 - Episode #1.3 - full transcript 
 Given district nursing duties Jenny meets and befriends old soldier Joe Collett,whose ulcerated legs make him a prisoner in his squalid tenement flat. Having allowed homeless old flame Jimmy to sleep in the convent boiler room Jenny gets him to help her take Joe to an army reunion but the flats are shortly demolished as uninhabitable and Joe ends up in an inefficient care home where he dies,leaving Jenny his few belongings. Her colleagues Trixie and Cynthia attend to middle-aged Winnie and Ted,both on their second marriage but,unlike the childless Ted, Winnie,who has three children of her own,is not looking forward to the baby's birth. After delivering the child the nurses see why but Ted is so elated that he is forgiving. Chummy meanwhile goes on a date with local policeman Peter Noakes.

 Sync and corrections by APOLLO BIKE BELL RINGS AND PEOPLE CHATTER WOMAN: Morning! Hello, Nurse Lee. Morning! MATURE JENNY: Before I came to Poplar, I'd been sheltered. I was shy, shielded from life's more... unsavoury facts. I'd kept my guard up, kept my head down, kept my distance from the world and believed myself content. What? Getting a good look, are you? Be nice. You might well be seeing a lot more of me. MATURE JENNY: Life in the East End had begun to make its mark.

 I was growing bolder. But there was still a great deal I was keeping in reserve. Another early one? Aren't they always? Sometimes you want to tell them to cross their legs till lunch time. A happy customer donated half a cow to our dinner table. WOMEN: Ooh! Must have been quite a delivery. Butcher's baby. SISTER BERNADETTE: It's not fireworks, is it, Fred? Nope. Well, that's something at least. Fred has another moneyspinning idea and won't tell us what it is. You're welcome to guess, but you won't get it. It's a winner, this one, I'm telling you. Fortes fortuna adiuvat.

 Fortune favours the bold. Thus Virgil. Quite right, Sister. Caput inter nubilia condo. I hide my head among the clouds. Also Virgil. It's too early for Virgil. Only for the ignorant. SISTER JULIENNE: Oh, Nurse Lee, excellent. I'm sure you wanted a rest after the night you've had, but I'm afraid you're needed. This is the one, ladies. I can feel it. "Who's got that big house on the hill? " people will ask, and it'll be me. You see if it ain't. And everyone will say, "He's not such a fool as we thought." GULLS CRY OUTSIDE The patient is Joe Collett. BELL CHIMES He suffers with ulcers on his legs and requires his dressings to be changed three times a week. Ulcers? I know you weren't on the district nursing rota for several weeks, but numbers at Nonnatus are limited, and the needs of our community are only ever expanding, so... Of course. Enjoy yourself. He is an interesting old man, I have found. DOOR SHUTS Hurry up. Sorry, it's my blasted slip. SHE SIGHS I took it in last night, but I think I've overdone it. It's somewhat restrictive to the breathing. Planning to work in that? I'm fine. Unless I bend. Or sit. Or laugh. Or cough. Or if I... Oh. Morning, officers. Good morning, Sister. Oh! I am so, so sorry. No harm done. You're something of a menace on that thing. I know. Er... Constable Noakes is the, um... the officer I managed to crash into a few weeks ago. If it's any consolation, she's a menace no matter how she conveys herself. Well, like I say, no harm done at all. Although maybe it'd be best if you had hit me. I wouldn't say no to more of that whiskey you brought over. I'm sure it can be arranged. The whiskey, not deliberately levelling you with my bicycle. You look well. And you. Very well. As do you. SISTER EVANGELINA CLEARS THROAT Well... I'd best be getting on. Uphold the law, good sir. Quite. Chummy...! Why on earth did I say that? At times like this, I'm more grateful than ever that I took vows. Now come along. Oh! CHILDREN CHATTER Mr Collett, I'm Nurse Jenny Lee. I'm here to see about your ulcers. Ah, yeah, well, it's my pleasure to have you here. I'm sure we're going to get along famous. Follow me. I've, er... I've got the boiling water ready. MR COLLETT GRUNTS HE GRUNTS Um... where can I lay out my instruments? Oh, just move that out the way. I'm going to clean the wounds now. It may sting, Mr Collett. Joe. Joe will do fine. Yeah. HE GASPS AND SIGHS Would you... would you like a cup of tea? I'm fine, thank you. Oh, it's no bother. It won't take but a minute. Oh, um... There. What... what's wrong? I'd actually, er... prefer a cold drink, if you had one. Then that's what you shall have, my maiden. Oh, no, I can't drink on duty. I meant orange squash or something. Oh. Well, I'm sorry. I... I don't have anything else. It doesn't matter. I got them from gun wounds during the war. The Boer War, this was. I thought you must be a soldier. HE CHUCKLES A soldier! Hardly. I was 17. No older than you. You're flattering me, Mr Collett. Yes. I... I am. Is it working? Absolutely! Over here. Beautiful bunch, eh? Lovely. Yeah. My two sons, they, er... joined the Great War and... they never came home. And my Sally... Yeah. A firebomb during the Blitz. I'm sorry. Don't be. I loved them. They loved me. HE SIGHS There. All done. Now, are you sure I can't offer you a drink? I'm quite all right, really. Yes, of course, er... you have a great deal to do, no doubt. CHILDREN PLAY OUTSIDE I have the evening off tonight. I could... come back then and share a glass with you? If... if you wanted that, I mean. Well, that would be a delight, my maiden. A thousand welcomes. BABY GRIZZLES Pregnant, eh? We're having a baby, you know. Me and my wife. Just found out today. I'm going to be a dad. Hush, Ted. Sorry, love. BABY WHINES Got no chance now, have I? Not now it's two against one. Mrs Lawson? That's us. Ted and Winnie. I'm sorry. We don't allow men back here. I can't stay with her? I'm sorry, Mr Lawson. I'll be right here, love, if you need me. Right here. We went to the doctor's this morning. I thought Win was ill, didn't I? Lost my first wife to cancer, so I was thinking the worst. She's been so tired. And there it is. Pregnant. Thought I was too old. I've got three already. Done most of their growing. I never even thought about another. There. 36 centimetres fundal height. That means you're 36 weeks along. Due in a month. That soon? Your husband said you only found out today? I... I knew I was getting bigger. So did Ted, though, bless him, he never said nothing. I thought maybe I was going through the change or... I don't know. Maybe I just didn't want to think I could be in the family way again. Not now. Mrs Lawson, are you all right? Course. Just a bit of a shock. I'm 41. I'm too old. All that all over again. It's just a bit of a shock. Thank you, Mr Collett. Joe. Joe. Joe. Yeah, well... I was afraid you wouldn't come. Here you are. Mm. Well, of course I am. How are your legs? Oh, very comfortable, thanks to you. Do you mind? Not at all. This is luxury, isn't it? Ah, but it is. When I was young, I would... I'd never have dreamed of such luxury. A warm bed at night. Enough food to eat. Huh! Oh. My Sally loved it here. CHILDREN PLAY NEARBY TRAFFIC PASSES Twice in one day, I know. Probably the last thing you want. But I thought I should drop round your delivery pack. Come in. Did you have any questions or...? No, you've been kind enough as it is, bringing this over. Now, Ted, I'm sure he'd be full of questions. Fortunately for you, he's out. He seems very excited. It's his first. You must think we make quite the pair. Not at all. My first husband walked out one day without a word, never came back. How awful. With three children to look out for, I got a job in a paper shop. Ted used to come in to that shop every day and just stare at this bar of chocolate and he'd leave without saying a word. I thought he was mad. Anyway, finally I ask him, "What are you up to?" And he says his wife used to love that chocolate. Then I started talking to him whenever he came in, and soon enough, he asked me to the pictures. A year later, we were married. That's lovely. Truth be told, I... I didn't marry him for love. It was for my children. Making a future for 'em, a life. But he's so kind, so patient. As time went by, I... I knew I hadn't done the wrong thing. (SOBS) But... What's wrong, Mrs Lawson? DOOR SLAMS Nurse? Everything all right? Absolutely. I just came to drop round the delivery pack. And that's all fine, so I should probably be on my way. I went to get some books. Margaret Myles, Midwifery. Grantly Dick-Read, Childbirth Without Fear. You'll know more than me by the time you've read that lot! I'll see you both soon. We were only 16 apiece, but I knew she was the only girl in the world for me. She agreed to wait until I got back from the war. Three years she waited. And she was the reason I came back at all. How romantic! That's my one weakness. BOTH CHUCKLE What about you? You must surely have a beau in your life? Not really, Mr Collett. I'm far too busy. Oh, never! A lively young girl like you? I don't believe it. There'll be plenty of time for romance when I'm older. Now, how about some more of those biscuits? Of course. No, I'll get them. Oh! Are you all right? Yes, yes, I'm fine. I, er... Do you know, I really think I should be going. Yeah, of course. You've... you've had a day's work today and you need your beauty sleep. No, no, don't get up. I'll... I'll see myself out. SHE GAGS LOW CHATTER How was the old man? He must have been handsome to keep you out so late. I had the most terrifying experience. I looked down and saw, right on the table... there were hundreds of insects. Just crawling about! Oh, those. Yes, they are a nuisance. It was revolting. It set off my asthma. You poor thing. Some of the insects I saw in India were as big as your hand, and their jaws, you saw every sharp glistening tooth, like, trying to bite you. Oh, sorry. All the tenements are full of insects. I'm surprised you hadn't seen them before. It's no wonder there's talk of closing the buildings down. There's always been talk. They're not hygienic. It's about time. I hold the insect in high esteem. I've often wished I had a thorax and a small pair of wings. Who on earth would wish to be an insect? We are all God's creatures. And I would have thought you above all people, Sister, would appreciate a more slender thorax. Behave yourself. I can't go back there, not with those things crawling about. Calm yourself, Nurse Lee. They do not infest human beings. And as for never going back there, it's out of the question. But, Sister... Your comfort is not important. You have a job to do with Mr Collett and you will do it. TAP TAP TAP, STONES FALLING DOG BARKS TAP DOG BARKS TAP Jimmy? What on earth are you doing here? I'm in a bit of a tight spot, Jenny. Can I come in? I'm not dressed. Please? Thanks, Jen. You're a brick. (Keep your voice down.) SHE MOUTHS How long have you been in London? About seven hours. I'm sorry. I did come by earlier, but you were out. Thank God you've still got that hideous clock. I saw it in the window and I knew I had the right room. I can't believe you're a nun now. (I'm not a nun, you fool. I'm a nurse who works with nuns.) Oh. Thank heavens. You're far too attractive to be a nun. Mind your cheek, Jimmy. If I can't be cheeky to a girl I've known for 18 years, then what hope is there? What are you doing here? You remember when you were studying? I was a bit short of cash. So Chris and I stayed in the drying room at the nurses' home. I do. Three months of nail-biting fear that you'd be found out. Why do you mention that? Oh, no. You can't stay here. A man in Nonnatus House? I'd be dismissed for sure. One night. I've nowhere else to go. (This way.) You better be gone by the crack of dawn. Scout's honour. DOOR CREAKS AND BIRDS CLUCK BIRDS CLUCK AND SQUEAK I assume there's a story here. I have no idea. All told, this might be the strangest night of my life. Good night. TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS SHE SIGHS Your guest made an early departure. Jimmy's an old friend. He had nowhere to stay. I didn't think... Don't worry, Nurse Lee, I shan't be telling any tales... since you no doubt caught sight that I had a few overnight guests of my own. Yes. They're quails. I'm a little short of space at home, and they'll do better in the warm. It all started with potatoes. I was growing 'em, see. But there's no money in spuds, so I switched to onions. And onions got me thinking, naturally, of chickens. Naturally. And that got me thinking, "Well, hang on, Fred. What about quails?" You know? Not really. People are always talking about chickens. Chickens this and chickens that, like they can't do no wrong. But I say... move over chickens, there's a new fella in town. Your quail. Ah, he tastes very similar, but he's half the size and twice the price. Ah... good for you. Don't worry, Nurse Lee. I shan't forget you when I'm rich. I'm telling you, I'm fine. Shush, just another minute. This is silly. I've got to do the washing. The book says we need to keep alert for any surges in temperature. You and your damn books. Let me help with the washing, love. The book says you'll be unsteady on your feet about now. We don't want you losing your balance, do we? I'm not a damned invalid, Ted. So put those bloody books away and let me be! Sorry. Nothing to apologise for, love. You seeing that smelly old man again? Bad enough I've got madam living on one side, I've got that disgusting old bugger on the other, stinking the place out... I'm telling you, you nurses ought to have something better to do than keep running around after him all the time. SHE SPITS I'm glad you came back. Oh, of course. Ah! Most kind. And now, please, you'll join me, seeing as it's the end of the day. Oh, allow me. A reunion of the Scots Guards? How exciting! Oh, yes, it's quite an occasion, you know. I used to enjoy them a great deal. You're not going? Oh, not for years now, thanks to these legs of mine. Huh! Well, what if I were to take you? Well, I... I don't want you to feel obliged. Mr Collett, it doesn't seem right that a man who fought for his country should be penned up at home. Besides, it's not every girl has the opportunity to dine with so many men in uniform. You darling girl! What a day we'll have! What a day! GULLS CRY In spite of everything, he stays so cheerful. I only hope I can be like that when I'm old. It sounds like he's had a full life. More than just work. Oh, stop it. There's more to me than work. I've had my share of adventures. Have you, now? When I was 17, there was a concert in London. My parents wouldn't let me go, so I stole out of the window, hitchhiked to London, saw the show anyway. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Well, well. What else haven't you told me? Are you secretly married? Wouldn't you like to know! Oh, please. I'll buy you these hideous earrings as a bribe. SHE LAUGHS No, what about these? Listen, I was hoping I could avail myself of the boiler room again tonight. I thought you were studying to be an architect, not a professional vagrant. I know, I know, but rent's so fearfully expensive, and I can't take any of Mother's money, she's barely any. So, I've been going from floor to floor. And tonight's floor has other occupants? Something like that. I promise I'll be discreet. Again. I'll throw in these. CLICKS CASTANETS Fine, fine! Although I think I know a way you can pay me back. Mr Lawson, is your wife on her way or...? Actually, it's, er... it's just me, if that's allowed. Of course. I'm trying to arrange the nursery, make all the preparations, you know. I've tried to talk to Winnie about it, but, well... she's busy around the house. We can talk about the nursery, Mr Lawson, but is that why you're really here? HE SIGHS Am I that see-through? Take a seat. Truth is, I'm worried about her. She ain't been herself. She's been... closed off. Barely talks to me. And when she does speak, she's angry or she's... crying. I don't know what to do. There are a lot of hormonal changes that happen when you're pregnant. A lot of women can get rather emotional. But you can't take it to heart, Mr Lawson. Support her, and she will get through this. DOOR OPENS Oh, my goodness! You look wonderful! You should have let me help you. HE CHUCKLES And missed the look on your face? Jimmy? Someone call for the cavalry? Ah! HE CHUCKLES I've heard a lot about you, Mr Collett. Then you'll know I prefer to be called Joe. I'm afraid Jenny hasn't returned the favour and I know very little about you. Well, I'm her secret weapon. Oh, yeah? JOE CHUCKLES LOW CHATTER Looks like quite a turnout. BOTH CHUCKLE Private Joseph Collett. Now, gentlemen, here is a truly distinguished old guardsman. HE CLEARS THROAT Collett, yes. To an esteemed old soldier. MEN: To an esteemed old soldier! APPLAUSE LOW CHATTER I... I won't forget this in a hurry. Thank you, Jenny. The pleasure is all mine. Maiden, I do hope you'll forgive me saying, but... I do believe your young man's sweet on you. SHE SIGHS I'm sure I don't know what you mean. You do! Now, then, sir, I'm sure you have many stories you can tell us all. HE CHUCKLES Oh, I don't know. I do, and he does. JOE CHUCKLES Stand by your beds! Now, I don't know how many of you remember your first sergeant major. The first sergeant major I had was very fond of poetry... MUSIC: "Magic Moments" by Perry Como # When two hearts are caring # Magic moments # Memories we've been sharing # I'll never forget the moment we kissed the night of the hay ride # The way that we hugged to try to keep warm while taking a sleigh ride # Magic moments # Memories we've been sharing # Magic moments # When two hearts are caring # Time can't erase # The memory of # These magic moments... # Excuse me. Can you watch where you're going, please? Fred! You're probably wondering what I'm doing with all these apples. I wasn't, really. Gonna take them home, dip 'em in toffee, put a stick in, and what have you got? Toffee apples. Another business venture? Huge profit margin in this one. Good luck with it, Fred. And be careful! Your ulcers are improving wonderfully, Mr Collett. Joe, please. What's wrong? You've been awfully quiet. They're closing the building. They're tearing the whole place down. Oh, there's been rumours for years, of course. I... I just never thought... But why? They say it's unsound. Lord knows why. It was still here after the Blitz. Me and Sally, we were here over 50 years. Raised our boys here. Now, I suppose... all my ghosts will be cleared with the rubble. Will they rest in peace? Huh. I wonder. Will I? Where will you go? Oh, er... St Mark's... in Mile End. When I was young, it used to be a workhouse. It's not right, Mr Collett. They can't make you leave your own home, can they? Oh, now. Don't bother so. Don't cry over an old codger like myself. It's just a flat, dear. But the block won't be demolished immediately. Why can't Mr Collett stay longer? At least until we find him somewhere better than an old workhouse. Nurse Lee, the decision has been made. The buildings are being closed and the tenants evicted. The best you can do is help ease the transition for him. But it's not fair! His legs need constant attention. Who will look after him now? God once said to St Peter, "When you are young, you go where you wish. "When you are old, others will take you where you do not wish to go." Is Fred about? The boiler's making all kinds of noises. I don't believe he's currently on the premises. It sounds like someone's clattering about in there. I'm going to take a look. Sister! Sister Bernadette! Sister? Yes? DOOR CREAKS I was thinking... we ought to grow more vegetables in our allotment. Whatever you please. I needed your advice. On what to grow. Because there's so much choice. Carrots... obviously, are helpful, but also... cauliflower is delicious. Do we grow onions? Please stop wittering about vegetables. I could not care less. What are you still doing here? I overslept. It's so warm in there. You can't keep coming to stay here, Jimmy. What if someone comes? DOOR SHUTS AND FOOTSTEPS Sister Julienne. This is Jimmy. He's an old school friend. He's here for... He's an old friend and... I just moved to Poplar. I work nearby and... and dropped in to say hello. BELL CHIMES Given the hour, I would be remiss if I didn't ask you to join us for lunch. Oh, no, no, I couldn't. Nonsense. You'd be doing us a great service. We usually entertain retired missionaries and visiting preachers. A lively young man would be a pleasure for us all. CROWS CAW SHE GASPS Oh! Oh! Winnie! Oh... What's happened? I'm all right. You're not. You're having contractions, aren't you? Leave me be! No, no. The book says that when they're this close together then the birth's on its way. We gotta call the midwives. My word. If I'd expected this kind of feast, I'd have worn more forgiving trousers. CHUMMY: Frightfully sorry I'm late. I just found out my old friend Binkie's getting spliced at last. (Oh, gosh.) Chummy, this is my friend, Jimmy. Jimmy, Chummy. Yes, gosh, marvellous. Um... good to meet you. Mm. So, James, you and Nurse Lee are old friends? Oh, we go a long way back. Jenny's always been good to me... way back when I used to stay in the drying room at her nurses' home. Nurse Lee! Quite the rebel, were you? Um... I... Ah. I remember when four young men were found in the broom cupboard at St Thomas's. We never found the culprits, which was just... as well! That's an awfully roomy cupboard. Were they sleeping standing up? This is too much. I can't... I shall never forget... What happened? Oh, come on, be a sport. I couldn't possibly... Sister, you can't keep them in suspense. Oh, I shall remember the hours that we spent. In age, I'll remember and not to repent. Don't say another word, my dear. 'Twill only debase your memories. Well, now we'll never hear the end of the story, Sister. You're quite the spoilsport. Now, tell me, young man, when are you two to be married? No, Jimmy and I are... are just friends, Sister. Friends? Oh, no. I don't think so. He's very handsome, isn't he? I knew a young man that looked like that once. I think. Young people have so much licence today. It must be so precious to be young and in love. Well, no arguments from me, Sister... though I'm not sure Jenny would agree. Sometimes I think she might be harbouring secret desires to join the order herself. HE CHUCKLES I'm glad you think my personal life is such a source of amusement. I didn't mean any harm. PHONE RINGS I'll go. SHE SOBS How are you doing, Mrs Lawson? Not so bad. You're going to be all right, love. Just take deep breaths. I'm right here with you. Stop it! Just stop it! Mr Lawson, would you mind popping downstairs while we examine your wife? She needs me here. We need hot water in good supply, and warm towels. Right. Right, of course. I'll, um... I'll get right to it. What is it? You listen. Fetal heartbeat is slow. Call Dr Turner, please. They say we've got to go. I know. Go where? Somewhere where no-one'll know me and I won't know no-one? It's not right. Can't you lot do something? You sisters, you have a say in how things go on around here, don't you? There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry. Joe? FLY BUZZES Still falling. Where's Dr Turner? He said he'd come as quickly as he could. Mrs Lawson, we need you to start pushing. Now? But it's too soon. I'm not ready. SHE GROANS Your body's telling you to push. Your baby wants to come out now. I can't! Please, Mrs Lawson. We're just trying to help you. I can't have this baby! SHE GROANS I can't! Yes, you can, my love. I'm scared! We're going to take good care of you. Don't worry. You don't understand! I'm scared. What are you so afraid of, Mrs Lawson? I'm scared it's going to be black. I don't care if it's green, red or orange. Your child's heart rate is dropping and I need you to start pushing. Now. SHE GROANS SHE GASPS Perfect. That's just right. Now I need you to do that again. I can't. You have to. SHE GROANS Get the towel ready. It's an asphyxiation. What's wrong? Little one's got the cord around its neck. Oh, God! But don't worry. We'll take care of that. We've done it plenty of times. It's too tight. Get me the clamps. DOORBELL RINGS What's happening? FOOTSTEPS You're doing brilliantly, Mrs Lawson. Now just hold off pushing for me. Upstairs. Breathe. FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS And breathe. I got here as fast as I could. The cord's clamped now. Mrs Lawson, we just need to cut this. There. Now, Mrs Lawson, we just need one last big push. SHE GROANS Now... There's a heartbeat. Why isn't my baby crying? What's happening? Let's just give it a minute. Let those lungs adjust. BABY GURGLES BABY CRIES It's a boy. Let me see him. BABY CRIES BABY GURGLES I'll... go and give your husband the good news. BABY GURGLES I'll let you know when the placenta's delivered. BABY GURGLES Shh, shh. BABY BURBLES Shh. There, there, now. BIRDSONG TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS DOG BARKS It's a boy. A boy! My little boy. Er... it... it's probably best to wait a little... until she's... she's ready for visitors. Right. Right. When Ted and I first married, I didn't know how lucky I was. I felt trapped, being with him. One night, I stayed out late. I'd had a drink. That's when I let a navvy with a nice smile charm me. One night is all it was. One night. It took me so long to find Ted. To really find him. Now I'm going to lose him. You don't know that. No offence, sweetheart, but you live and work in a convent. In the real world, a black baby... BABY GURGLES Here. BABY WHIMPERS BABY GURGLES I reckon we'd best get it over with. DOG BARKS You can come up now, Mr Lawson. A boy! You don't know what this means to me, Win... Can I hold the baby? BABY WHIMPERS BABY GURGLES MRS LAWSON: Ted... I don't reckon to know much about babies... but I can see how this is the most beautiful baby in the world. SHE SOBS What are we going to call him? Why don't you choose, Ted, love? We'll call him Edward, then. Good old family name. My son, Ted. Oh, my word! Do you think he didn't notice? He was emotional, excited. He wasn't thinking straight. Or he chose to ignore it, because he loves his wife and wants to spend his life with her. Time will tell, I suppose. CLEARS HIS THROAT Oh! Constable Noakes! What are you... what are you doing here? Actually I'm, er... I'm here to see Fred. What can I do for you, Constable Noakes? I came to warn you about your toffee apples. There's been complaints that, um... there are feathers stuck to some of your apples. Oh. What's a few feathers here and there? Don't make no difference. There have also been reports that some apples have... well, that they have blood on them. What you getting at? You're slaughtering quails in the same place you're making toffee apples. That's illegal, Fred. There's some safety boffins on their way to your house to shut you down. Look, I'll tell you what this is. This is persecution, that's what this is. This is government interference, and I won't put up with it. I won't stand for it. I'll fight 'em. I'll fight 'em in court. Or you could just dash back and take care of things before they make their inspection. Yeah, I could do that, couldn't I? Evening. Good evening. You look well. Well, and you. Oh, enough. I cannot watch any more. Constable Noakes, would you like to take Nurse Browne to the pictures on Friday evening? I, er... Simple question. Yes or no. Yes. Yes, I would. Nurse Browne, would you like to go? I'd love to. Excellent. How marvellous for you both. Now I can get on and enjoy my cake. Have you come to scrounge a bed again? Because I'm not in the mood. I came to apologise. I brought chocolates. I'm sorry I offended you at the lunch. I meant nothing by it. I may be private about my feelings, Jimmy. It doesn't mean I'm about to become a nun. I know. It was a joke... and not a very good one. It was no way to repay your kindness for the last few weeks. I'm on my way out. I promise not to come bothering you any more. Bye. SOFT SNORING Oh! Oh! I told you I'd visit, Mr Collett. My maiden! You... you've come here. I went to your flat and got quite a surprise. Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I... I don't like goodbyes. Besides, you're here now. And I'm grateful for it. And you're comfortable? Oh, yes. Doing very nicely, thank you. How are your legs? Oh. A little bit itchy now and again, yeah. Did you know they don't let you smoke in here? You're only allowed out on the steps, and I can't find anyone to take me. They're very busy, I suppose. Well, I'm not. Mm. TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS Sheer luxury. HE SIGHS Are they looking after you here, Joe? Oh, hush, hush. Enough of that. Let's just enjoy each other's company, shall we? How's that young man of yours? He's not my... Not your young man. I know. I know. I miss my family. Their absence is an ache I feel every waking moment. But if you open yourself to love, it follows you open yourself to heartache. You'll know the secret of life, my dear, when you know how to love. SISTER JULIENNE: # Before the ending of the day SISTERS: # Creator of the world, we pray # That with thy wonted favour, thou # Would'st be our guard and keeper now # From all ill dreams defend our eyes # From nightly fears and fantasies # Tread underfoot our ghostly foe # That no pollution we may know # O, Father that we ask be done... # MATURE JENNY: Removed from his home and the care of district nurses, Joe could not be given the necessary care. His ulcers became gangrenous and both legs had to be amputated at the knee. SISTERS: # ..Doth live and reign eternally # Amen. # It's me, Mr Collett. Joe, it's me. Jenny. My legs are itching. Could you... could you scratch them, my maiden? They're terribly itchy. Of course I will. Don't cry, my dear. I'll... I'll be all right. SISTER BERNADETTE: # Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace SISTERS: # According to thy word # For mine eyes have seen # Thy salvation # Which thou hast prepared # Before the face of all people # To be a light to lighten the Gentiles # And to be the glory... # BIRDSONG # ..Of thy people of Israel... # MATURE JENNY: Joe died soon after his operation. There was no Last Post. No solemn drum roll. No final salute. # World without end # Amen. # MATURE JENNY: Joe remembered me in his will. He didn't have to, for I would not forget him. I'd seen so many lives begin, but it was the end of his that opened up my heart. MUSIC: "You're Just In Love" by Perry Como # I hear singing and there's no-one there # I smell blossoms and the trees are bare # All day long I seem to walk on air # I wonder why # I wonder why... # BABY CRIES Mr Lawson. How is the little one? BABY GURGLES Some kind of cough, I think. Thought I'd better get him looked at. # Stars that used to twinkle... # He still seems besotted. He certainly does. # I wonder why... # MATURE JENNY: Ted loved purely and completely... and he asked no questions. And in the end, nor did anybody else. # I smell blossoms and the trees are bare... # BIRDSONG To Joe. My friend. To Joe. # I wonder why # I wonder why. # It seems I'm going to a dance... voluntarily. Aren't we the lucky fellows? Gillian! Have you seen my baby? She was in her pram! Please, someone help me! Someone help me! Someone's taken my baby! She was overheard stating she wanted to hurt her baby. That's utterly ridiculous. I love her. I wouldn't hurt her for the world. Help. Help me. Help me, please. It will be distressing. Are you sure you'll be able to handle it? Of course. # It is not so surprising # That you feel very strange but nice # Your heart goes pitter-patter # I know just what's the matter # Because I've been there once or twice # Put your head on my shoulder # You need someone who's older... # Sync and corrections by APOLLO
