ALL RIGHT, JUNIOR, LET'S RUMBLE. YOU'RE GOING TO TOKAHANA, SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL GET READY. OH, GOD, NOT TOKAHANA. YOU'LL BE SITTING WITH THE TYLER FAMILY. HEY!  HEY! OF ALL THE IDIOTS IN THE WORLD, THEY SIT ME NEXT TO THIS ONE. I WISH I COULD CHANGE MY SEAT.

I WISH YOU WOULD JUST GO APOLOGIZE TO THAT MAN SO WE CAN ALL EAT IN PEACE. HE WAS IN THE WRONG -- CLEARLY IN THE WRONG. IT'S CALLED BEING THE BIGGER MAN, MICHAEL. I LIKE THAT, JAY. I COULD LIVE WITH THAT. "BE THE BIGGER MAN." I LIKE THE WAY THAT SOUNDS. ON MY RéSUMé -- "MICHAEL KYLE, THE BIGGER MAN." EXCUSE ME, MR. TYLER. I'D LIKE TO OFFER AN APOLOGY. I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE AT THE GAS STATION, AND I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE. TRUCE? SURE. I'LL BE THE BIGGER MAN. NO! NO! NO-NO! I WAS THE BIGGER MAN. I OFFERED THE APOLOGY. EXCUSE ME, IT TAKES A BIGGER MAN TO ACCEPT AND FORGIVE. THEREFORE, I AM THE BIGGER MAN. YOU ARE THE SUPPLICANT. OH, NO, I'M NOT. SEE, BECAUSE, TECHNICALLY, YOU ACCEPTED MY APOLOGY, WHICH MAKES YOU THE SUCCULENT ONE. ALL RIGHT, THEN, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT -- I RESCIND MY ACCEPTANCE. TOO LATE! TOO LATE!

I CERTAINLY CAN. I RECOMMEND THE IMPERIAL DINNER. IT COMES WITH YOUR CHOICE OF CHICKEN, SHRIMP, STEAK, OR LOBSTER. YOU HEAR THAT? [ Imitating ] "LOSTER." HE SOUNDS LIKE RICARDO MONTALBAN. IF HE WAS JAPANESE, IT WOULD BE "ROBSTA, ROBSTA." I'LL HAVE THE IMPERIAL WITH ROBSTA. AND WE'LL HAVE THE IMPERIAL DINNER, TOO, PLEASE, BUT WE'LL HAVE IT WITH "SLEAK." STEAK -- MEAT.

Jay: HEY, BABY. COME HERE. I HEAR YOU MADE AMENDS IN THE BATHROOM. HE MADE AMENDS, ALL RIGHT. HE MADE A MEN'S ROOM VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. WHAT? THE GUY TOTALLY VIOLATED GOOD URINAL ETIQUETTE. WHAT IS "GOOD URINAL ETIQUETTE"? LOOK, IT'S AN UNWRITTEN MALE LAW -- THAT IF I'M USING A URINAL, THE NEXT GUY HAS TO USE THE URINAL FURTHEST AWAY FROM ME. THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A MINIMUM OF ONE EMPTY URINAL ON BOTH FLANKS. IT'S THE COMFORT ZONE, OR THE SPLASH ZONE, IF YOU WANT. AND ON TOP OF THAT, THIS PIG DOESN'T EVEN WASH HIS NASTY HANDS. I'M TELLING YOU, HONEY, THEY CHANGED THE SAUCE. IT'S TANGIER. OKAY, IT'S TIME NOW FOR THE MAIN COURSE. CAN'T WAIT TO GET AHOLD OF THAT LOBSTER. IT'S GONNA MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER.

[ LAUGHING ] WATCH OUT. WHOO. HA HA HA HA HA. THERE WE ARE. THERE YOU GO. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR LOBSTER? "IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY LOBSTER?" HE ASKS. MICHAEL, DON'T. IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR LOBSTER? YEAH, CONSIDERING THAT YOU DIDN'T WASH YOUR NASTY HANDS, AND YOU PUT THEM ON MY LOBSTER, THERE'S SOMETHING VERY WRONG WITH MY LOBSTER. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I ALWAYS WASH MY HANDS! DIDN'T WASH THEM THIS TIME. YOU DIDN'T WASH YOUR HANDS? DADDY, THAT'S DISGUSTING! STAY OUT OF IT!  STEW, NOT AGAIN! [ SIGHS ] I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU. I HAD ENOUGH OF YOU, TOO, SALTY FINGERS. I HAD ENOUGH OF BOTH OF YOU. AND SO HAVE I! SIT DOWN, MICHAEL! STEWART, SIT DOWN! HE PUT PEE-PEE FINGERS ON MY LOBSTER. THAT'S WHAT IT WAS. NABU WILL MAKE YOU ANOTHER LOBSTER, WON'T YOU, NABU?

THERE WE GO WITH THE GAS STATION AGAIN, HUH?! AND WHY DID YOU STAND NEXT TO ME AT THE URINAL AND VIOLATE THE SPLASH ZONE? OH, MY GOD! WHY DID YOU TOUCH MY CRUSTACEAN WITH YOUR PEE-PEE FINGERS?
