 Narrator: POWER. STRENGTH. PRECISION. THE CH-47 CHINOOK IS A BOX FULL OF SURPRISES. Man: THE CHINOOK IS THE FASTEST HELICOPTER IN THE U.S. MILITARY INVENTORY. Narrator: IT LOOKS LIKE A LUMBERING GIANT, BUT THIS HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION CAN MOVE LIKE A BUTTERFLY. Man: YOU CAN DO THINGS IN A 47 THAT YOU CAN'T DO WITH ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT. Narrator: AND IT CAN STING LIKE A BEE.

 [GUNFIRE] OVER FIVE DECADES, IT'S TAKEN A BEATING. Man: THEY WERE GETTING SHOT DOWN FAIRLY FREQUENTLY. Narrator: AND MADE MORE COMEBACKS THAN ROCKY. Man: IN THE INSIDE IT WAS AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT HELICOPTER. Narrator: BUT ITS BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS YET TO COME. ¶ 2010. PAKTIKA PROVINCE, AFGHANISTAN. AMERICA HAS BEEN AT WAR WITH AL QAEDA AND THE TALIBAN FOR EIGHT LONG, BLOODY YEARS. [GUNFIRE]

 IN DECEMBER, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA ANNOUNCES A MAJOR TURNING POINT FOR U.S. FORCES. President Obama: OUR COALITION WILL SET A GOAL FOR AFGHAN FORCES TO BE IN THE LEAD FOR COMBAT OPERATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY NEXT YEAR. Narrator: COALITION TROOPS VOW TO LEAVE THE REGION FREE OF TALIBAN CONTROL. [GUNFIRE] Brian Lutz: WE'D BEEN IN AFGHANISTAN TO THAT POINT ABOUT NINE YEARS, AND THE TALIBAN WAS KIND OF REASSERTING ITSELF ACROSS THE COUNTRY. Narrator: BRIAN LUTZ WAS A HELICOPTER PILOT AND A U.S. ARMY CAPTAIN IN THE PAKTIKA PROVINCE FOR ONE YEAR. Lutz: THE GOAL WAS TO STABILIZE THE REGION, SUPPORT THE AFGHAN NATIONAL ARMY, AND ESTABLISH RULE OF LAW THROUGHOUT THE AREA. Narrator: TO SUCCEED, THE ARMY MUST OPERATE DAILY IN AFGHANISTAN'S RUGGED MOUNTAINS. IT'S A MISSION THAT DEMANDS AIR SUPPORT FROM A ONE-OF-A-KIND HELICOPTER, THE CH-47 CHINOOK. IT'S WHAT THE ARMY SENDS WHEN THE IT NEEDS POWER AND PAYLOAD IN A SINGLE PACKAGE. THE CHINOOK'S TANDEM ROTORS MAKE IT ONE OF THE MOST RECOGNIZABLE AIRCRAFT ON THE PLANET. Guy Clouse: WE'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE CH-47F CHINOOK HELICOPTER. THAT'S THE ARMY'S WORKHORSE FOR HEAVY LIFT AND MASS TRANSPORT ON THE BATTLEFIELD. Narrator: THE CHINOOK'S DUAL ROTORS MAKE IT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO FERRY TROOPS AND HEAVY LOADS TO HIGH ALTITUDES, AND FAST ENOUGH TO GET OUT OF TROUBLE IN A HURRY. Clouse: THE CHINOOK HELICOPTER HAS TWO 60-FOOT-DIAMETER ROTOR SYSTEMS, SO THEY'RE COMPLETELY EQUAL. AND THEY BOTH CAN BE MANIPULATED TO MANEUVER THE HELICOPTER IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. Narrator: THROW TWO HONEYWELL TURBOSHAFT ENGINES INTO THE MIX, AND YOU HAVE AN AIRCRAFT THAT CAN CARRY UP TO 28,000 POUNDS. THE CHINOOK'S MOTTO: "YOU CALL, WE HAUL." Clouse: WE HAVE TWO OF THESE ENGINES GENERATING OVER 5,000 HORSEPOWER APIECE. THESE ARE THE MOST POWERFUL ENGINES ON ANY U.S. MILITARY HELICOPTER. Narrator: THAT KIND OF POWER IS EXACTLY WHAT ARMY AIRBORNE OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN NEED. Clouse: POWER IS EVERYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO ALTITUDE BECAUSE THE AIR GETS THINNER, IT TAKES MORE POWER TO KEEP THE HELICOPTER IN THE AIR. BECAUSE OF THE POWER THAT IT HAS, IT CAN WITHSTAND THAT THIN AIR BETTER THAN ANY OTHER HELICOPTER. Narrator: A FULLY LOADED CHINOOK CAN EASILY CRUISE UP TO 8,000 FEET, BUT THE ALTITUDES IN AFGHANISTAN EXCEED 10,000. IN PAKTIKA PROVINCE, THE CHINOOK'S ENGINES MUST BE PUSHED TO THEIR LIMIT, AND MAYBE BEYOND. FOR U.S. SOLDIERS, AFGHANISTAN'S PAKTIKA PROVINCE IS ESPECIALLY TOUGH. Lutz: THE TAGLINE MY BATTALION COMMANDER USED CONSISTENTLY WAS, "THERE ARE NO ROUTINE MISSIONS IN PAKTIKA PROVINCE." Narrator: THAT'S BECAUSE PAKTIKA PROVINCE LIES ALONG THE 1,600-MILE DURAND LINE, ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS BORDERS IN THE WORLD. TO STOP THE TALIBAN FROM GAINING GROUND, U.S. TROOPS MUST PATROL THE ENTIRE LENGTH. Lutz: OUR GUYS WERE MOVING OUT INTO THE MOUNTAINS TO TRY AND CATCH FOREIGN FIGHTERS, FIND SOME OF THEIR SUPPLY, LIKE ARMS AND ARMAMENT, BEFORE IT GOT DISTRIBUTED OUT TO LOCAL TALIBAN FIGHTERS. Narrator: GROUND TROOPS SPEND WEEKS IN THE MOUNTAINS TRYING TO CONTROL THE TERRITORY. WHEN THEY NEED A RESUPPLY, THEY TURN TO ONE AIRCRAFT: THE CH-47 CHINOOK. SHARANA AIR BASE, AFGHANISTAN. CAPTAIN BRIAN LUTZ AND HIS CREW READY THEIR CH-47 FOR A ROUTINE MISSION. AN URGENT REQUEST COMES ACROSS THE RADIO. Lutz: WE GOT A CALL LETTING US KNOW THAT THERE WAS A UNIT THAT HAD BEEN IN AND OUT OF CONTACT THROUGHOUT THE DAY THAT NEEDED AN EMERGENCY RESUPPLY. Narrator: 30 MILES TO THE SOUTH, A PLATOON OF INFANTRY SOLDIERS WAGES BATTLE WITH THE ENEMY ON TOP OF A MOUNTAIN RIDGE 8,000 FEET HIGH. [GUNFIRE] AND THEY'RE ALMOST OUT OF AMMO. Lutz: IF THEY DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT AMMUNITION TO ENGAGE THE ENEMY, THE LAST COUPLE DAYS THAT THEY SPENT OUT THERE CHASING AFTER THESE GUYS ARE GOING TO BE FOR NOTHING. Narrator: LUTZ AND HIS CREW QUICKLY LOAD THEIR CHINOOK WITH CARGO THEY CALL "SPEEDBALLS." Lutz: SPEEDBALLS IS A FANCY TERM FOR A BODY BAG FULL OF WATER, AMMO, AND FOOD. IT'S KIND OF MACABRE BECAUSE IT'S A BODY BAG, BUT IT'S SOMETHING WHERE YOU CAN ZIP IT UP, IT'S WATERPROOF, AND YOU CAN TOSS IT OUT OF THE BACK OF AN AIRCRAFT RELATIVELY QUICKLY. Narrator: LOCKED AND LOADED, THE CHINOOK LIFTS OFF AND HEADS NORTH TOWARDS THE FIREFIGHT. EVERY MINUTE COUNTS FOR THE MEN ON THE GROUND. [GUNFIRE] Lutz: THEY'D BE MOVING THROUGH THE AREA, AND SOMEONE WOULD START SHOOTING AT THEM, AND THEN AS SOON AS THEY'D START TO ENGAGE, WHOEVER IT WAS WOULD KIND OF SCATTER. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, RANDOMLY THEY'D JUST START GETTING HIT FROM ANOTHER SPOT. SO THEY CONSISTENTLY WERE TAKING CONTACT. Narrator: LUTZ AND HIS CREW FLY INTO DANGEROUS TERRITORY. BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM. THE CHINOOK'S SIZE MAKES IT A VERY TEMPTING TARGET. ITS TWO BIG ROTORS COME WITH A HEAVY PRICE. THEY LEAVE THE CH-47 EXPOSED AND VULNERABLE. A LUCKY POT SHOT CAN EASILY BRING IT DOWN. Lutz: YOU CAN'T PUT ARMOR ON ROTOR BLADES. IT JUST DOESN'T WORK. YOU'VE GOT SOME BASIC ARMOR PLATING IN THE AIRCRAFT UNDER SOME OF THE CREW STATIONS, BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT. Narrator: THE CHINOOK'S SPEED AND STRENGTH MAKE IT THE GO-TO BIRD FOR THE MOST DANGEROUS OPERATIONS. BUT AS A RESULT, SOME OF THE LARGEST LOSSES OF LIFE IN AFGHANISTAN HAVE BEEN IN CHINOOKS. AROUND A HUNDRED U.S. LIVES LOST. AS MANY AS 30 AT A TIME. THE TEN-MINUTE FLIGHT TO THE COMBAT ZONE IS TENSE. ¶ Lutz: THERE'S A LOT OF MOUNTAINS THAT KIND OF FUNNEL INTO THIS LARGER VALLEY, AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF THESE, UH, SPURS THAT KIND OF SHOOT OFF OF THAT AND THAT ARE VERY STEEP RIDGELINES. SO THERE'S NOWHERE REALLY THAT YOU COULD PUT A FULL AIRCRAFT AND BE ABLE TO JUST LAND IT AND SET IT DOWN. ¶ Narrator: LUTZ LOOKS DOWN AT A MOUNTAIN RIDGE THAT DROPS SHARPLY ON EACH SIDE. THE SUMMIT IS LESS THAN FIVE FEET WIDE. Lutz: CHINOOK'S A BIG AIRCRAFT. FIRST THOUGHT WAS, UH, YEAH, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO LAND THERE, UM, NOT EVEN PUT THE REAR TWO WHEELS DOWN. Narrator: BUT TURNING BACK IS NOT AN OPTION. AMERICAN TROOPS ARE COUNTING ON THE SUPPLIES. Lutz: THE FLIGHT ENGINEER IMMEDIATELY PIPED UP WITH, "I THINK WE CAN JUST PUT THE RAMP ON THE TOP OF THE RIDGELINE AND WE CAN OFFLOAD FROM THERE." Narrator: IT'S A DARING SOLUTION. TO MAKE IT WORK, LUTZ MUST MAINTAIN A STEADY HOVER-- JUST A HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE NARROW RIDGE. THIS IS CALLED A PINNACLE LANDING. IT CALLS FOR NERVES OF STEEL. Lutz: THE AIRCRAFT AND THE ENVIRONMENT ARE KIND OF INHERENTLY A LITTLE BIT UNSTABLE. UP IN THE MOUNTAINS LIKE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF, LIKE, WIND CURRENTS. SO, IF YOU CATCH A PARTICULARLY STRONG GUST AND THOSE ROTOR BLADES ARE MOVING PRETTY FAST, SO IF THEY CLIP SOMETHING, IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BRING THE AIRCRAFT DOWN. Narrator: LUTZ HAS TO CONDUCT THIS PINNACLE LANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF TALIBAN TERRITORY. AND THE ENEMY IS ON TO HIM. [GUNFIRE] ¶ ONE WRONG MOVE, AND THIS RESUPPLY MISSION WILL TURN TRAGIC. ¶ [GUNFIRE] Narrator: CAPTAIN BRIAN LUTZ'S CH-47 CHINOOK HOVERS PRECARIOUSLY ABOVE A RIDGELINE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF AFGHANISTAN. DIRECTLY BELOW, AN ENTIRE PLATOON IN DESPERATE NEED OF SUPPLIES. LUTZ FIXES HIS EYES FIRMLY ON HIS DISPLAYS AND EXECUTES A TEXTBOOK STATIC HOVER. ¶ THE GUNNER KEEPS WATCH FOR ENEMY FIRE. Lutz: THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST DANGEROUS PORTION OF THE MISSION. YOU'RE TRYING TO MAINTAIN YOUR POSITION, AND YOU'RE MOST VULNERABLE AS YOU'RE JUST KIND OF SITTING THERE HOVERING. Narrator: THE RAMP TOUCHES DOWN. THE CHINOOK'S CREW QUICKLY UNLOADS. ¶ LESS THAN A MINUTE LATER, THE CHINOOK TAKES OFF. IT LEAVES 1,000 POUNDS OF AMMUNITION AND SUPPLIES IN AMERICAN HANDS. Lutz: GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE RESUPPLY AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS AT ALTITUDE WHERE YOU MAY HAVE VERY LIMITED SPACE TO DROP OFF, THE CHINOOK WAS 100% THE BEST AIRCRAFT FOR THE JOB. Narrator: IN AFGHANISTAN, CHINOOKS HOIST THEIR MAXIMUM GROSS WEIGHT OF 26,000 POUNDS AT ALTITUDES OF OVER 16,000 FEET, LIFTING MORE AT GREATER HEIGHTS THAN ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE ARMY'S INVENTORY. Lutz: THE CHINOOK IS KIND OF THE BELLE OF THE BALL FOR A LOT OF STUFF IN AFGHANISTAN BECAUSE WE CAN TAKE A LOT OF WEIGHT, UH, REGARDLESS OF THE ALTITUDE. Narrator: BEFORE THE CHINOOK, GETTING CARGO TO THE FRONT LINES WAS A CHALLENGE-- ONE THAT HIT HOME MORE THAN EVER IN THE KOREAN WAR. [ARTILLERY FIRE] 1953. [GUNFIRE] AMERICAN-LED U.N. FORCES ARE CAUGHT IN A STALEMATE WITH CHINESE-BACKED NORTH KOREAN COMMUNISTS. Roger Connor: FOR MOST OF THE CONFLICT, THE FRONTLINE WAS STATIC. Narrator: ROGER CONNOR IS THE ROTARY WING CURATOR AT THE NATIONAL AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM. Connor: THE U.S. DEPENDED ESSENTIALLY ON HAVING MORE AMMUNITION THAN THE ENEMY HAD TROOPS TO ABSORB IT. Narrator: BOTH SIDES FACE THE TOUGH TASK OF KEEPING TROOPS ON THE FRONTLINES SUPPLIED. Connor: THERE WAS VERY LITTLE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE, SO THE ROAD NETWORK WAS ALMOST NONEXISTENT, NO RAIL LINES. SO, TO MOVE ANY SORT OF HEAVY SUPPLIES OR EQUIPMENT REQUIRED A NEW WAY OF TRANSPORTATION. Narrator: U.S. COMMANDERS SCRAMBLE FOR IDEAS AND REALIZE THERE'S ONE THING THEY HAVE THAT THE NORTH KOREANS DON'T: HELICOPTERS. Connor: THE HELICOPTER HAD EMERGED AS A VIABLE MILITARY TOOL AT THE END OF WORLD WAR II. IT WAS STILL A VERY IMMATURE TECHNOLOGY. THE FIRST REALLY PRACTICAL TRANSPORT HELICOPTERS DIDN'T COME OUT UNTIL THE KOREAN WAR. Narrator: THE BELL H-13... THE SIKORSKY H-19... IN KOREA'S RUGGED LANDSCAPE, HELICOPTERS SHINE. TROOP TRANSPORT. RESUPPLY. MEDEVAC. EVEN SURVEILLANCE. POSSIBILITIES FOR THE NEW TECHNOLOGY SEEM ENDLESS. Connor: KOREA TURNED OUT TO BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR SHAPING THE FUTURE USE OF HELICOPTERS. HELICOPTERS WERE SO ESSENTIAL THAT IT CAUSED COMMANDERS TO REALIZE THAT THIS WAS A TOOL THAT COULD NO LONGER BE OVERLOOKED. ¶ Narrator: AFTER KOREA, THE ARMY WANTS TO MAKE ITS HELICOPTERS EVEN BETTER. BUT PRESIDENT EISENHOWER AND HIS SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN FOSTER DULLES HAVE A DIFFERENT PLAN. Connor: WHEN PRESIDENT EISENHOWER ENTERED OFFICE IN 1953, HIS ADVISORS, ESPECIALLY HIS SECRETARY OF STATE, JOHN FOSTER DULLES, ENCOURAGED HIM TO USE THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS, ESPECIALLY THE NEW HYDROGEN BOMB, AS A DETERRENT. Narrator: DULLES BELIEVES FIXED-WING BOMBERS WILL GIVE AMERICA THE ADVANTAGE IN THE ATOMIC AGE. HE HAS LITTLE TIME OR MONEY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HELICOPTERS. Connor: NUCLEAR BOMBERS TOOK AWAY THE ARMY'S EMPHASIS ON CONVENTIONAL GROUND FORCES. SO, ARMY GROUND COMMANDERS BECAME VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD JUSTIFY THEIR PLACE IN FUTURE CONFLICTS. Narrator: TOP BRASS QUICKLY COME UP WITH A CREATIVE SOLUTION. IN 1954, ARMY MAJOR GENERAL JAMES GAVIN PUBLISHES AN ARTICLE IN "HARPER'S MAGAZINE." ITS TITLE: "CAVALRY, AND I DON'T MEAN HORSES." IT INTRODUCES A NEW ARMY DOCTRINE: AIR MOBILITY. GAVIN ARGUES THAT HELICOPTERS CAN TRANSPORT MORE THAN JUST TROOPS. THEY CAN TRANSPORT TACTICAL ATOMIC WEAPONS AROUND THE BATTLEFIELD. AIR MOBILITY MAY MAKE HELICOPTERS RELEVANT IN THE ATOMIC AGE. BUT FOR THE CONCEPT TO WORK, THEY NEED AN UPGRADE. Connor: UNFORTUNATELY, THE EXISTING HELICOPTER FLEET WAS NOT CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THE ARMY'S NEW ORIENTATION TO ATOMIC WEAPONS. IT NEEDED ONES THAT COULD LIFT HEAVIER LOADS. SO, THEY NEEDED TO DESIGN HELICOPTERS THAT WERE CAPABLE OF MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS. Narrator: ARMY ENGINEERS GET DOWN TO WORK. DESIGNING THE RIGHT HELICOPTER WON'T BE EASY. Connor: THE BIGGEST TECHNICAL PROBLEM OF HELICOPTERS IN THE 1950s WAS THEIR ENGINES. MOST OF THE FIRST GENERATION MILITARY HELICOPTERS WERE USING ESSENTIALLY SURPLUS WORLD WAR II PISTON ENGINES. Narrator: ENGINEERS EXPERIMENT WITH A NEW TECHNOLOGY. IT'S CALLED THE JET TURBINE ENGINE. Connor: THE TURBINE ENGINES WERE ABLE TO PUT OUT A LOT MORE POWER THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS. THEY WERE MORE ECONOMICAL TO OPERATE, THEY TOOK UP A LOT LESS SPACE SO THAT IT WAS A LOT MORE EFFICIENT FOR CARRYING CARGO. Narrator: THE ARMY BELIEVES A TURBINE-POWERED HELICOPTER COULD BE THE ANSWER TO ITS TRANSPORT PROBLEMS. WHAT'S MORE, WHAT IF THEY COMBINED IT WITH A DESIGN TRIED AND TESTED SINCE THE MID '40s: THE TANDEM ROTOR. NEARLY ALL HELICOPTERS REQUIRE AT LEAST TWO ROTORS TO FLY. CONVENTIONAL CHOPPERS USE A TOP-MOUNTED ROTOR TO GENERATE LIFT. AS THE TOP ROTOR TURNS, IT CREATES THE ROTATIONAL FORCE CALLED TORQUE. TORQUE CAUSES THE CHOPPER'S BODY TO SPIN AWAY FROM THE ROTOR. TO COUNTER THIS TWISTING MOTION, A TAIL ROTOR. IT SPINS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE MAIN ROTOR, PROVIDING A COUNTER FORCE THAT KEEPS THE HELICOPTER STABLE AS IT FLIES. TANDEM-ROTOR HELICOPTERS HAVE TWO EQUALLY-SIZED ROTORS MOUNTED ON TOP. THESE ROTORS SPIN IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, NEUTRALIZING THE PROBLEM OF TORQUE. NO POWER IS WASTED IN KEEPING THE HELICOPTER POINTED LEFT OR RIGHT. ALL THE POWER GOES INTO VERTICAL LIFT. TANDEM-ROTOR CHOPPERS ARE INHERENTLY BIGGER AND STRONGER. COMBINE THAT WITH A TURBINE ENGINE, AND THE ARMY BELIEVES IT WILL HAVE A WINNER. Connor: THE ARMY WANTED ITS NEW TRANSPORT HELICOPTER TO BE ABLE TO CARRY AT LEAST A FULL PLATOON OF FULLY EQUIPPED SOLDIERS, SO THIS MEANT A TANDEM-ROTOR HELICOPTER. BY ADDING TURBINE ENGINES TO IT, IT MADE IT ALL THAT MUCH MORE CAPABLE. Narrator: 1957, WASHINGTON, D.C. THE ARMY STAKES ITS FUTURE ON GETTING A STATE-OF-THE-ART HELICOPTER. IT LOOKS TO THE VERTOL CORPORATION FOR HELP. VERTOL TRIES TO ANTICIPATE ARMY NEEDS FAR INTO THE FUTURE. Connor: FORTUNATELY, VERTOL WAS ABLE TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT VERY QUICKLY, AND THE ARMY ULTIMATELY GOT WHAT THEY WANTED, AND THAT'S WHAT WE NOW HAVE AS THE CHINOOK. ¶ Narrator: 1961, PHILADELPHIA. THE ARMY ROLLS OUT ITS LATEST SOLUTION TO AIR MOBILITY: THE CH-47 CHINOOK. THE CHINOOK IS MASSIVE: 52 FEET LONG AND 23,400 POUNDS, EMPTY. BUT DON'T BE FOOLED. ITS ABILITY TO DANCE IN THE AIR DEFIES ITS BULK. Clouse: THE CHINOOK IS THE FASTEST HELICOPTER IN THE U.S. MILITARY INVENTORY. IT'S ALSO VERY MANEUVERABLE, AND THAT IS DUE TO ITS TANDEM-ROTOR DESIGN. THE TANDEM ROTOR ALLOWS US TO DIRECT THAT IN WHATEVER MODE WE'D LIKE TO DO, WHETHER IT'S THE POWER TO HOVER, THE SPEED, OR MANEUVERABILITY. Narrator: THE CHINOOK CAN EVEN LOAD AND UNLOAD IN THE WATER. Connor: ONE OF THE INTERESTING FEATURES OF THE CHINOOK IS THAT IT'S SEMI-AMPHIBIOUS. THIS MEANS THAT FOR SPECIAL OPERATIONS, FOR INSTANCE, THEY CAN ACTUALLY PARK THE BACK END OF THE HELICOPTER IN THE WATER, LOWER THE RAMP, AND ACTUALLY HAVE A SPECIAL OPERATIONS TEAM DRIVE THE BOAT INTO THE AIRCRAFT WHILE IT'S SITTING THERE IN THE WATER, AND TAKE OFF. Narrator: INSIDE ITS CARGO HOLD, THE CHINOOK HAS 228 SQUARE FEET FOR EQUIPMENT AND SOLDIERS. THAT'S MORE THAN ANY OTHER U.S. ARMY HELICOPTER TO DATE. Dani Taylor: OUR CABIN AREA IS OVER 30 FEET LONG. WE CAN LOAD OVER 15,000 POUNDS. IF WE NEED MORE SPACE, WE CAN LEVEL OUT THE RAMP AND ADD MORE CARGO THERE, AND WE CAN FLY WITH THE RAMP LEVEL. Narrator: THE CHINOOK IS BIG... POWERFUL... VERSATILE. BUT PROOF OF ITS WORTH ONLY COMES IN BATTLE. ¶ 1965, VIETNAM. COMMUNIST-LED INSURGENTS FROM THE NORTH PUMMEL THE U.S.-BACKED SOUTH TO THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. PRESIDENT LYNDON JOHNSON VOWS TO CRUSH COMMUNISM IN ITS TRACKS. President Johnson: I HAVE TODAY ORDERED TO VIETNAM THE AIR MOBILE DIVISION, AND CERTAIN OTHER FORCES WHICH WILL RAISE OUR FIGHTING STRENGTH FROM 75,000 TO 125,000 MEN ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. Narrator: GETTING TROOPS INTO THE COUNTRY IS EASY. MOVING THEM AROUND FAST ENOUGH TO SUSTAIN AN OFFENSE... NOW, THAT'S TOUGH. John Sims: VIETNAM WAS DIFFICULT TO TRAVEL, EITHER BY FOOT OR BY VEHICLE. Narrator: CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER JOHN SIMS WAS A CHINOOK PILOT FOR MORE THAN 27 YEARS. Sims: THE ROADS WERE VERY POOR. UH, THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY WAS FAIRLY MOUNTAINOUS, THE SOUTHERN PART WAS VERY SWAMPY. IT...IT WAS AT SEA LEVEL. THE ROAD SYSTEM WAS VERY BAD. Narrator: IN SEPTEMBER, MILITARY PLANNERS RECEIVE A HELPING HAND: THE CH-47 CHINOOK ON ITS FIRST COMBAT DEPLOYMENT. THE CHINOOK QUICKLY BECOMES KNOWN AS A U.S. ARMY WORKHORSE. THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH GAINING A REPUTATION: THE ENEMY NOTICES. [GUNFIRE] Sims: FROM THE TIME THE CHINOOKS ENTERED THE WAR IN VIETNAM, THEY WERE GETTING SHOT DOWN FAIRLY FREQUENTLY. Narrator: THE ENEMY DESTROYS 62 CHINOOKS. WITH EACH ONE, THE ARMY'S REPUTATION TAKES A HIT. Connor: HAVING THE CHINOOK PERFORM WELL WAS ESSENTIAL TO THE ARMY'S JUSTIFYING ITS PLACE IN THIS MODERN FORCE STRUCTURE. Narrator: THE ARMY HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP THE CHINOOKS FROM GETTING SHOT DOWN. ITS ENTIRE AIR MOBILITY STRATEGY, AND SOLDIERS' LIVES, ARE AT STAKE. Narrator: 1966, VIETNAM. THE CHINOOK PROVES ITSELF AS A VITAL SUPPLY HELICOPTER, BUT IT'S TOO EASILY SHOT DOWN. THE ANSWER: GIVE SOME OF THE BIRDS ADDITIONAL FIREPOWER. THE ARMY MODIFIES FOUR CH-47s TO CREATE THE ACH-47 CHINOOK. THE "A" STANDS FOR "ARMED." OFFICIALLY, IT'S KNOWN AS THE ATTACK CARGO HELICOPTER. UNOFFICIALLY, "GUNS A GO-GO." [GUNFIRE] Ralph Holloway: THE ARMED CHINOOK REALLY LOOKED JUST LIKE A REGULAR CHINOOK ON THE OUTSIDE. Narrator: RETIRED MAJOR RALPH "DOC" HOLLOWAY SERVED THREE TOURS IN VIETNAM. Holloway: FROM THE INSIDE, IT WAS AN ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT HELICOPTER. ALL OF OUR SPACE WAS TAKEN UP WITH AMMUNITION AND GUNNERS. Narrator: THE ACH-47 HAS FIVE .50-CALIBER MACHINE GUNS, TWO 20-MILLIMETER CANNONS. IT CARRIES 38 ROCKETS AND A GRENADE LAUNCHER IN ITS SNOUT. IT'S MORE THAN JUST A HEAVY LIFTER. NOW THE CHINOOK IS A FLYING TANK. FEBRUARY 1967. AN KHE, VIETNAM. HOLLOWAY AND ANOTHER GO-GO CREW HEAD OUT ON AN URGENT MISSION. Holloway: THIS TEAM UP IN THE MOUNTAINS NORTH OF THE BONG SON WAS UNDER ATTACK. THEY NEEDED FIRE SUPPORT. IT WAS A RUNNING FIGHT OF 4 AGAINST 150 VIET CONG AND, UH, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE ODDS. Narrator: TWO CHINOOKS RACE NORTH. FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER, THEY LOOK DOWN AT A GUNFIGHT IN THE JUNGLE. HOLLOWAY KNOWS HE NEEDS TO MAKE A RESCUE, AND FAST. Holloway: THESE GUYS WERE TAKING AN AWFUL LOT OF FIRE. WE REALIZED THAT THEY WERE EITHER GOING TO BE KILLED OR CAPTURED, OR WE WERE GOING TO GET THEM OUT. THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY TO GO. Narrator: GETTING CLOSE ENOUGH FOR A RESCUE IS A DICEY PROPOSITION. VIET CONG QUICKLY HONE IN ON THE BIG NEW TARGET. Holloway: WHEN WE GOT THERE AND GOT CLOSE TO THE TEAM, WE STARTED PICKING UP A HEAVY LEVEL OF GROUND FIRE. WE KNEW THAT WE HAD AN IFFY SITUATION AT BEST. Narrator: ONE CHOPPER SWOOPS IN TO PICK UP THE TROOPS. HOLLOWAY HOLDS A HOVER TO SHOW THE VIETCONG JUST WHAT THE GO-GO BIRD CAN DO. Holloway: SO, OUR TASK WAS TO PROVIDE THE SUFFICIENT SUPPRESSIVE FIRE TO ALLOW THE TROOPS TO BREAK CONTACT AND MOVE AWAY. WHEN THE WINGMAN LANDED ON THE TOP OF THE HILL, I GAVE THE COMMAND TO OPEN FIRE, AND THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED OUR CURTAIN OF STEEL. [GUNFIRE] WE DIDN'T HOLD BACK ANYTHING, WE FIRED EVERYTHING WE HAD... [GUNFIRE] AND AS FAST AS WE COULD FIRE. EACH ONE OF THE GUNS WAS FIRING 250 ROUNDS A MINUTE. THE 40-MILLIMETER WAS FIRING 200 ROUNDS A MINUTE, AND IT'S AN EXPLODING ROUND. I'M SURE THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD HAD OPENED UP ON THEM. Narrator: THE FOUR U.S. SOLDIERS SCRAMBLE INTO THE WAITING CHOPPER. THE CHINOOKS QUICKLY PULL UP AND RACE TO SAFETY. Holloway: WE GOT BACK IN FORMATION AND FLEW OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND BACK TO THE LZ AND UNLOADED THE TROOPS. IT'S A VERY SATISFYING FEELING. IT'S A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT. ANYTIME YOU CAN SAVE AMERICANS, YOU'VE DONE ALRIGHT. Narrator: THE MODIFIED TRANSPORT CHOPPER PROVES ITS POWER AS A FIGHTING MACHINE. EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE ONLY FOUR, WORD SPREADS. Holloway: THE STANDARD CHINOOK STARTED RECEIVING LESS FIRE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE VIET CONG WERE NOT ABLE TO DETERMINE EASILY WHETHER THE HELICOPTER THEY WERE SHOOTING AT WAS REALLY AN ARMED CHINOOK OR NOT. Narrator: BY THE END OF THE WAR, THE CHINOOK IS A GIVEN, PROVING THAT AIR MOBILITY IS HERE TO STAY. AS GOOD AS THE CHOPPER IS, THE ARMY WANTS IT TO DO MORE. Sims: EVEN DURING VIETNAM, THEY REALIZED THAT THEY WANTED TO INCREASE THE CAPABILITY OF THE AIRCRAFT. Narrator: IN 1976, THE ARMY DELIVERS ALMOST 500 CHINOOKS TO BOEING'S PRODUCTION FACILITY IN PENNSYLVANIA. ENGINEERS STRIP THEM DOWN TO THE AIRFRAME AND REBUILD THEM FROM SCRATCH. THE REVAMPED CHOPPER HAS FIBERGLASS ROTOR BLADES, IMPROVED AVIONICS, UPGRADED HYDRAULICS, AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, EVEN MORE POWERFUL ENGINES. VIETNAM-ERA CHINOOKS HAVE A PAYLOAD OF 10,000 POUNDS. ENGINEERS CLAIM THE UPGRADED MODEL CAN LIFT ALMOST THREE TIMES THAT MUCH. BEFORE THE NEW MODELS DEPLOY, THE ARMY TESTS THEM TO THE BREAKING POINT. HOW WELL WILL THIS NEW AIRFRAME HOLD UP IN COMBAT? ¶ 1995. BOSNIA. AFTER THREE AND A HALF BLOODY YEARS, THE BOSNIAN WAR FINALLY ENDS. BUT THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED ETHNIC TERRITORIES LEAVE THE WAR-TORN COUNTRY ON EDGE. Christiane Amanpour: IN A FEW DAYS, 60,000 U.S. AND OTHER N.A.T.O. TROOPS WILL START ROLLING IN TO ENFORCE THIS PEACE. Narrator: AMERICAN TROOPS PLAN TO ENTER THROUGH CROATIA. THEY ARE FORCED TO CROSS THE BORDERING SAVA RIVER. Kenneth Brookins: AT THE TIME, THERE WAS NO BRIDGE THAT ACTUALLY LED INTO BOSNIA, SO THE MILITARY DECIDED TO BUILD A BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER. Narrator: SERGEANT KENNETH BROOKINS WAS A FLIGHT ENGINEER WITH THE 159th REGIMENT IN BOSNIA. Brookins: IT WAS IMPERATIVE TO GET THIS BRIDGE COMPLETED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Narrator: BUT HOURS BEFORE CONSTRUCTION BEGINS, IT'S THE RIVER THAT MAKES THE FIRST ATTACK. Brookins: OVERNIGHT, THE RIVER OVERFLOWED ITS BANKS AND ACTUALLY WIPED OUT THE BASE CAMP THAT THE ENGINEERS HAD SET UP. Narrator: THE AMERICAN CAMP IS COMPLETELY UNDERWATER. NOW THE ARMY CAN'T DO ITS JOB. Brookins: THE ENGINEERING GROUP WAS IN A TOTAL PANIC. YOU COULD SEE VEHICLES, LIKE 2.5-TON TRUCKS, HALF-SUBMERGED, BUT YOU CAN'T MOVE THEM BECAUSE THE GROUND, AT THAT POINT, IS TOO SOFT. Narrator: THE ARMY HAS JUST THREE DAYS TO BUILD THE BRIDGE AND JOIN THE REST OF N.A.T.O. FORCES IN BOSNIA. WITH ITS CAMP SWEPT DOWNRIVER, GENERALS HAVE TO COME UP WITH ANOTHER PLAN. Brookins: THEY REALIZED THAT WHEELED VEHICLES WOULDN'T BE THE OPTION TO ACTUALLY GET THE BRIDGE SECTIONS IN THE WATER, SO THEY BROUGHT IN CHINOOKS. Narrator: THE CHINOOK HAS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO HAUL. WHATEVER'S TOO BIG TO FIT INSIDE ITS CARGO GETS HOOKED TO THE OUTSIDE OF ITS BODY. PALLETS, SHIPPING CONTAINERS, HUMVEES. THE CHINOOK CAN EVEN HAUL A 7,000-POUND HOWITZER AT MORE THAN 100 MILES PER HOUR. IT'S CALLED SLING LOADING. Taylor: THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE FOR THE CHINOOK TO DO EXTERNAL SLING LOADS HAS GOT TO BE OUR THREE HOOKS. WE HAVE A FORWARD AND AFT HOOK THAT, TANDEM, CAN HOLD UP TO 25,000 POUNDS, AND OUR CENTER HOOK JUST BY ITSELF, WITH A SINGLE POINT LOAD, CAN HOLD 26,000 POUNDS. Narrator: COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PILOT AND FLIGHT ENGINEER IS CRITICAL WHEN ATTEMPTING TO SLING LOAD. Taylor: DURING A SLING LOAD OPERATION THE PILOT HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN BELOW HIM, BECAUSE HE CAN'T SEE IT. HE'S BASICALLY FLYING BLIND. HE TRUSTS US AS HIS FLIGHT ENGINEERS TO BE ABLE TO TELL HIM WHAT'S GOING ON. Narrator: FLIGHT ENGINEERS GUIDE THE PILOT BY LOOKING THROUGH A HOLE IN THE CHINOOK'S FLOOR. ITS NICKNAME: THE HELL HOLE. Taylor: IN HERE IS WHERE WE ACCOMPLISH ALL OF OUR CARGO HOOK DUTIES. EVERYTHING WE DO TO HOOK UP THE LOAD WILL BE DONE FROM THIS POSITION. NORMALLY WE LAY DOWN BY THE CENTER HOLE, ABOUT ALL THE WAY OUT TO OUR HIPS, SO WE CAN GET THE BEST VIEW POSSIBLE. Narrator: THE PILOT LOWERS THE CHOPPER OVER THE LOAD. THE FLIGHT ENGINEER CALLS OUT COMMANDS TO HELP GAUGE HIS POSITION. GROUND CREWS WORK TO HOOK UP THE CARGO. TO KEEP CREWS SAFE, THE PICKUP MUST BE PERFECT. Taylor: THE MOST CRITICAL POINT OF DOING A SLING LOAD IS WHEN YOU'RE HOOKING IT UP. IF WE'RE NOT HAVING GOOD CREW COORDINATION AND COMMUNICATING WITH OUR PILOTS, IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE CATASTROPHIC. [WHIRRING] Narrator: KAPOSUJLAK AIR BASE, HUNGARY. BROOKINS AND HIS CREW TAKE OFF FOR BOSNIA. 40 MINUTES AFTER TAKEOFF, THE CHINOOKS REACH THE RIVER. NEARLY A HUNDRED BRIDGE PIECES WAIT FOR THEM. Brookins: THE SETUP WAS LITERALLY WE WERE GOING TO PICK UP THE BRIDGE FROM THESE PICKUP ZONES AND FLY THEM TO THE DROP POINT IN THE RIVER. Narrator: BROOKINS AND HIS CREW APPROACH THEIR FIRST BRIDGE PIECE. FIVE FEET BELOW, GROUND CREWS SCRAMBLE TO HOOK THE CHINOOK TO ITS LOAD. THE SOLDIERS WORK ONLY FEET FROM THE CHINOOK'S BLADES. ANY WRONG COMMAND TO THE PILOT COULD BE FATAL. AS THE CHINOOK HOVERS ABOVE THE BRIDGE PIECE, BROOKINS NOTICES A PROBLEM. Brookins: BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH ICE SATURATION ON TOP OF THE BRIDGE SECTIONS, JUST FROM THE NORMAL ROTOR WASH WE GENERATE WE WERE BLOWING PEOPLE OFF THE TOP OF THESE BRIDGE SECTIONS. AFTER SEEING A COUPLE HOOKUP PERSONNEL FALL, WE REALIZED WE COULDN'T CONTINUE THAT. Narrator: THE CHINOOK'S TWIN ROTORS CREATE MORE DOWNWASH THAN ANY OTHER CHOPPER. IT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF STANDING IN THE WAY OF A FORCE-FOUR HURRICANE. THE GROUND CREW MUST SCATTER. THE MISSION IS IN JEOPARDY. Narrator: IN BOSNIA, GROUND CREWS MUST ATTACH PIECES OF AN ICY BRIDGE TO A POWERFUL CHINOOK. BUT THE CHOPPER'S POWERFUL DOWNWASH MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE. Brookins: WE KIND OF BASICALLY TOLD THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TO JUST SET THE SLINGS UP ON TOP OF THE LOAD, WE WOULD PICK THEM UP, BECAUSE IT WAS SO DANGEROUS DUE TO ALL THE ICE. Narrator: SERGEANT BROOKINS AND HIS CREW COME UP WITH A NEW PLAN: HOOK UP THE BRIDGE SPAN FROM INSIDE THE CHINOOK. Brookins: WE HAVE A POLE INSIDE THE AIRCRAFT WE CALL A SHEPHERD'S HOOK THAT THE CREW MEMBER IN THE BACK OF THE AIRCRAFT WOULD REACH DOWN AND JUST SIMPLY GRAB THE CLEVIS AND HOIST IT UP TO THE AIRCRAFT THEMSELVES. Narrator: IT TAKES JUST MINUTES FOR THE FLIGHT ENGINEER TO DO WHAT GROUND CREWS COULDN'T. NOW IT'S TIME TO PUT THE CHINOOK'S UPGRADED ENGINES TO THE TEST. Brookins: THE WORST THING THAT COULD HAPPEN IS ENGINE FAILURE. WORSE YET, DUAL ENGINE FAILURE. IT'S EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU'RE CONNECTED TO AN OBJECT. AS THE FLIGHT ENGINEER, YOU'RE CONSTANTLY INSPECTING THE LOAD AS YOU'RE COMING UP. Narrator: THE CHINOOKS MUST NOW HAND OFF THE BRIDGE TO BOATS WAITING IN THE RIVER. ADDING DANGER, THEY MUST FLY THEIR LOAD LOW OVER THE TREE LINE. ¶ MINUTES LATER, THE CHINOOK HOVERS ABOVE THE RIVER. BROOKINS GIVES THE PILOT THE CUE TO DROP AND WATCHES THE 12,000-POUND BRIDGE SPAN DROP INTO THE ICY WATERS. ¶ THAT'S ONE SPAN DOWN. BUT IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING. THERE'S ALMOST 100 MORE PIECES TO GO. IT'S THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE BRIDGE IS FULLY CONSTRUCTED. THANKS TO THE CHINOOK'S POWERFUL LIFT, THE BRIDGE BECOMES A FLOATING PASSAGEWAY FOR TANKS, ARTILLERY, AND NEARLY 20,000 AMERICAN TROOPS. Brookins: DUE TO THE ENGINE UPGRADES, THE CHINOOK WAS FLAWLESS IN THE EFFORTS NEEDED FOR THIS CAMPAIGN. THERE'S NO OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE MILITARY INVENTORY THAT COULD HAVE DONE SUCH AN OUTSTANDING JOB. ¶ Narrator: THESE EVENTS PROVE AN UPGRADED CHINOOK, WITH THE RIGHT CREW, IS A WEIGHTLIFTING CHAMPION. BUT CRITICS COMPLAIN THAT THE ARMY IS TOO SLOW TO KEEP UP WITH THE LATEST ADVANCEMENTS IN COCKPIT TECHNOLOGY. A FULLY UPGRADED CHINOOK SHOULD HAVE MORE POWER AND BE ABLE TO FLY BLIND. 2009. OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM STEAMROLLS INTO ITS SIXTH YEAR. [CHANTING] A MONTH INTO OFFICE, AMERICA'S NEW LEADER CALLS FOR CHANGE. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA SETS A HARD DEADLINE FOR TROOP WITHDRAWAL. President Obama: BY AUGUST 31, 2010, OUR COMBAT MISSION IN IRAQ WILL END. Narrator: BUT TROOPS STILL FACE ALL THE DANGERS OF WAR. ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS TO LIFE AND LIMB: IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES. IEDs ARE CHEAP, EASY TO MAKE, AND LETHAL. THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR AROUND HALF OF ALL THE U.S. CASUALTIES IN AFGHANISTAN. THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP SOLDIERS SAFE FROM IEDs IS TO KEEP BOOTS AND TIRES OFF THE GROUND. THAT'S WHERE THE CH-47 COMES IN. Brandon Tipton: IT'S A LOT HARDER TO IED A HELICOPTER THAN IT IS A VEHICLE. THE MORE YOU FLY A CHINOOK, THE LESS CONVOYS YOU HAVE TO HAVE ON THE GROUND. Narrator: CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER 4 BRANDON TIPTON FLEW THE CHINOOK ON THREE DEPLOYMENTS IN IRAQI FREEDOM. Tipton: YOU CAN DO SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS IN A 47 THAT YOU CAN'T DO WITH ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT. WE FLEW AT LEAST FOUR AIRCRAFT A NIGHT EVERY NIGHT FOR A YEAR. Narrator: THE CHINOOK DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IEDs, BUT FLYING IN IRAQ HAS ITS OWN SPECIAL HAZARDS. Tipton: THERE'S NOT ANY CITIES OUT THERE, SO IT IS JUST FLAT BROWN DIRT. AND AT NIGHT, YOU CAN'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUND AND THE SKY. IT'S ALL THE SAME COLOR. Narrator: IT'S A LANDSCAPE THAT LEADS TO THE MOST DANGEROUS SITUATION ANY PILOT ANYWHERE CAN FACE: SPATIAL DISORIENTATION. Tipton: SPATIAL DISORIENTATION IS THE INABILITY OF A PILOT TO FEEL OR TELL WHERE THEY ARE IN RELATION TO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH. IT BECOMES MUCH WORSE WHEN YOU'RE FLYING IN A DUST CLOUD AND REDUCED VISIBILITY. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING THE NIGHT WE WENT OUT AND DID OUR MISSION. ¶ Narrator: SPEICHER AIR FORCE BASE, IRAQ. TIPTON AND ANOTHER CHINOOK TOUCH DOWN WITH THEIR CARGO. IT TAKES LESS THAN AN HOUR TO UNLOAD THE SUPPLIES. THEN IT'S TIME TO FLY BACK TO HOME BASE AT TAJI. BEFORE THEY HEAD HOME, TIPTON CHECKS IN ON THE WEATHER. Tipton: THEY SAID, HEY, JUST SO YOU GUYS KNOW, THE WIND IS PICKING UP HERE. SO, WE ROGERED AND SAID, OK, WE'RE JUST FINISHED DROPPING OFF THE STUFF HERE, AND WE'RE HEADED HOME. Narrator: THE CHOPPERS TAKE OFF IN PAIRED FORMATION. ¶ ABOUT 20 MINUTES INTO THE FLIGHT, TIPTON NOTICES SOMETHING WRONG. Tipton: OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYES, AS I'M WATCHING THE AIRCRAFT IN FRONT OF ME, I CAN SEE MY PILOT WHO'S FLYING WITH ME JUST KIND OF DO THIS, WHICH DENOTES TO ME THAT SHE'S GETTING SPATIALLY DISORIENTED. Narrator: TIPTON QUICKLY CHECKS IN WITH THE REST OF HIS TEAM. Tipton: I CALLED OVER OUR INTERNAL COMM SYSTEM AND SAID, HEY, CAN YOU GUYS SEE THE GROUND RIGHT NOW? AND THE "OH, CRAP" MOMENT WAS WHEN I GOT THE CONFIRMATION FROM MY CREW MEMBERS AND THE OTHER AIRCRAFT THAT NOBODY COULD SEE THE GROUND ANYMORE. ¶ WHAT HAD HAPPENED WAS WE'D FLOWN INTO A DUST CLOUD, WHICH WE DID NOT EXPECT. IT'S NOT A SMALL DUST CLOUD. IT'S A DUST CLOUD THAT'S 50 MILES WIDE AND MAYBE A HUNDRED MILES DEEP OF JUST DIRT IN THE AIR. ¶ [WHIRRING] I WOULD SAY OUR VISIBILITY DROPPED FROM A FIVE MILE, I CAN SEE EVERYWHERE I'M GOING, DOWN TO AN EIGHTH OF A MILE OR LESS. YOU CAN SEE THE WINDOWS, AND THAT'S ABOUT AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE. Narrator: THERE'S NO WAY THE TWO CHINOOKS CAN FLY AROUND THE CYCLONE OF SAND, OR EVEN SEE CLEARLY ENOUGH TO LAND. THEY ARE TRAPPED IN MID-AIR... BURNING UP FUEL... AND NO WAY OUT. ¶ Narrator: IN IRAQ, CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER 4 BRANDON TIPTON FLIES OVER ENEMY TERRITORY, IN A SANDSTORM, AT NIGHT. IT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER, UNLESS HE COMES UP WITH A SOLUTION... FAST. Tipton: FOR THE FIRST FEW SECONDS, IT'S, IT'S SHEER TERROR, AND I SAID, OK, WE'RE GOING TO USE THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR TO FLY THE AIRCRAFT. Narrator: THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR IS PART OF THE CHINOOK'S BRAND-NEW AVIONICS. Tipton: THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR IS REALLY JUST A COMPUTER THAT TAKES READINGS FROM EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON THROUGH SENSORS AND CAN MANIPULATE THE FLIGHT CONTROLS WITHOUT YOU HAVING TO DO IT. Narrator: IT'S AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM CRITICS SAY HAS BEEN TOO LONG IN COMING, AND TIPTON HAS NEVER USED IT BEFORE IN COMBAT. Tipton: PILOTS INHERENTLY ARE CONTROL FREAKS. AND GIVING UP THE CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT TO A COMPUTER IS ONE OF THE LAST THINGS YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO DO. WE OBVIOUSLY ALWAYS WORRY ABOUT THERE BEING SOMETHING WRONG. WITH ANY COMPUTER, GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE OUT. SO, IF YOU'RE NOT PUTTING THE RIGHT STUFF IN, IT CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. Narrator: BUT IN THIS CASE, TRUSTING THE NEW AVIONICS SYSTEM IS TIPTON'S ONLY OPTION. Tipton: WE ENTERED THE DESIRED ALTITUDE AND THE AIR SPEED AND THEN TURNED THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR ON AND LET THE AIRCRAFT TAKE CONTROL OF WHERE WE WERE GOING. ¶ Narrator: WITHIN SECONDS, TIPTON'S CHINOOK IS UNDER THE COMPUTER'S CONTROL. [RADIO CHATTER] IT PERFORMS FLAWLESSLY. Tipton: I KIND OF LOOKED OVER AT THE PILOT I WAS FLYING WITH, AND WE BOTH JUST DID THE... [INHALES, EXHALES] DEEP BREATH AND SAID, OK, WELL, THIS THING WORKS LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO. IT'S JUST A HUGE RELIEF. Narrator: 45 MINUTES LATER, THE CHINOOKS TOUCH DOWN BACK AT TAJI. WITHOUT THE NEW COMPUTER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT STORY. Tipton: HAVING THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR IN THE AIRCRAFT THAT NIGHT MADE MY LIFE AS AN AIR MISSION COMMANDER A LOT EASIER BECAUSE I KNEW I COULD RELY ON THAT THING TO BRING EVERYBODY HOME. Narrator: THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR COMPUTER ONLY BECAME PART OF THE STANDARD U.S. ARMY CHINOOK IN 2007. BUT SINCE THEN, IN AFGHANISTAN ALONE, ACCIDENTS DUE TO SPATIAL DISORIENTATION HAVE GONE DOWN 800%. Sims: THE DESIGN OF THE FLIGHT CONTROL SYSTEM THAT WE SEE IN OUR NEWEST VERSION OF THE CHINOOK WILL ALLOW THE AIRCRAFT TO, UH, TO HOVER HANDS OFF, EVEN THOUGH THE CREW CAN'T EVEN SEE OUTSIDE THE COCKPIT, AND TO SAFELY LAND THE AIRCRAFT UNDER THOSE EXTREME CONDITIONS. Narrator: THE U.S. ARMY HAS SPENT TENS OF MILLIONS UPGRADING THE CHINOOK OVER ITS LIFETIME. STRONGER AIRFRAMES, ADVANCED DIGITAL COCKPITS, FLARE DISPENSERS TO DISTRACT ENEMY RADAR. Tipton: THE AIRCRAFT IS ONLY GETTING BETTER WITH IMPROVEMENTS. I THINK THE CHINOOK IS GOING TO BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME TO COME. Narrator: THE CHINOOK'S GREATEST CHALLENGE NOW: CAN IT SET A NEW RECORD? IT JUST MAY BECOME THE LONGEST SERVING AIRCRAFT EVER. Connor: FIFTY YEARS ON, THERE'S STILL NO REPLACEMENT FOR THE CHINOOK IN THE PIPELINE. THIS MAY BE THE FIRST AIRCRAFT THAT SEES A CENTURY IN SERVICE. Narrator: THE CHINOOK'S RESUME GROWS WITH EACH YEAR. Holloway: YOU CAN ARM IT, YOU CAN FLY IT AT NIGHT, IT WILL CLIMB HIGH MOUNTAINS, IT WILL FLOAT, IT WILL REFUEL IN FLIGHT, IT WILL DO ANYTHING. Narrator: ICONIC, VERSATILE, POWERFUL. THE CH-47 CHINOOK HELPED DEFINE ARMY AVIATION. Holloway: THE CHINOOK HAS GIVEN THE ARMY A LIFTING CAPABILITY THAT WAS DESPERATELY NEEDED. Narrator: MORE THAN 1,200 CHOPPERS HAVE ROLLED DOWN THE PRODUCTION LINE. ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE STILL IN SERVICE. Connor: THE CHINOOK HAS CHANGED VERY LITTLE COSMETICALLY OVER ITS LIFESPAN. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THE MOST GLAMOROUS HELICOPTER IN THE INVENTORY, BUT IT IS THE ONE AIRCRAFT THAT YOU KNOW IS GOING TO GET THE GOODS THERE WHEN YOU NEED THEM. Narrator: THE UNITED STATES ARMY PLANS TO USE THE CHINOOK INTO 2040 AND BEYOND. Connor: EVERY TIME THE TERMINATION DATE FOR CHINOOK PRODUCTION COMES UP, UH, IT SEEMS TO STRETCH OUT A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. Narrator: THE CHINOOK. BORN FROM A PERCEIVED NEED TO CARRY NUCLEAR WEAPONS, TRANSFORMED IN VIETNAM FROM AN AIRBORNE TRUCK TO A TACTICAL WEAPON, AND ADAPTED TO BE THE TIP OF THE SPEAR IN AFGHANISTAN. IT LIFTS THE HEAVIEST OF LOADS. FLIES FASTER THAN ANY CHOPPER IN THE U.S. ARMY, AND HELPED MAKE THE ARMY'S AIR MOBILITY DOCTRINE STICK. Holloway: THE CHINOOK IS STILL GOING STRONG TODAY, AND WITH NO END IN SIGHT. IT WILL BE HERE FOREVER.
