 I don't know what you want from me. You have more power than you think. Your lady - I don't trust her. Take care of it. Get out while you can, Kiki. Promise me. You can get free from all this. So can you. Guess who is on Mr Tufnell's board of directors? Raphael Cilenti. And the name of the company in line to secure a million-pound contract on the bases, post the NATO summit? Tufnell Engineering. The Chancellor is going to resign. McCain has offered us the exclusive. Why is Mr McCain giving this to us? OK. Somewhere, Cilenti is pulling McCain's strings.

 What if we're about to go live with the story Cilenti wants us to run? Too damned late. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. 'Opening the Commons' defence debate yesterday, newly-appointed Defence Minister, 'Mr Howard Satchell, told ministers that, until there's agreement on disarmament, 'any major attack from Russia, even with conventional forces alone, would have to be met 'with nuclear weapons. Without such devices, the West would have to submit to defeat and occupation. 'American missiles in Britain are essential, not only to the safety' 'of the country, but also to affirming a commitment to a nuclear alliance 'with the United States of America.' 'Now for news from home and the body of a woman has been found in a back street of London's West End. 'The woman, in her twenties, has yet to be identified, but is believed to be foreign to the country. 'The Metropolitan Police suspect she was murdered. Detectives are appealing to the public for help. 'The rise of...' Bastards.

 Still no Mrs Lyon? She's, um, still with friends. Better scrub it off before she gets back. I'm sorry. It's not going to wipe the smile off my face today. You're hiding something. Want a lift? Sissy? Not in yet. Miss Rowley, I was just wondering... Not now. When she gets here, tell her to try Miss Ramirez again. Mrs Williams, CND, is in your office. She's very forceful. And? You're late! Sorry. Sorry. Miss Ramirez, try her at home and try her at the club. I already... Try her again! OK. Henrietta Williams. I just read her article in The Granta. Did you listen to the radio this morning? Yes. Why? Apologies for keeping you waiting. Someone's rattled today. A brilliant write-up on the Chancellor scoop. Not a scoop. A plant, Miss Storm. Has anyone spoken to McCain yet? Randall asked me to hold fire. Ha-ha! Which you ignored. He's not taking my calls. Do they mention me anywhere? No, but Mr Brookes from the Chronicle is very much in love with Hector's hair. The toys they are playing with arm a silent war, where fear is the currency to control us and our lives. Politicians advocate armament as a means to maintain peace. It is a weary mantra that is designed to disguise the truth. Are you a mother? No. Yet you roll your eyes. I patronise you if I assume you to be mother? But is there nothing greater than to bring life onto this Earth? And yet how terrifying that it is amidst such inevitable annihilation. Look, I don't want to depress you, but Hiroshima, Nagasaki... we cannot add London, Glasgow, Manchester to that appalling list. We are staring into an abyss. Well, you speak even better than you write. It does not save Hector from him helping him sideline us and that Cilenti was behind it. Do you have Tufnell's accounts? I want to go through them again. There must be something ripe to trip Cilenti up with. Christ! Our views will be seen by the pro-nuclear world as hysterical, so find me a worthy opponent. We're talking to the newly-appointed Defence Minister. Mr Satchell? Yes, please. He's more in favour than anybody of the American-British alliance. Excuse me a moment. Oh, God. What have we done? What have we done? Name that dinner guest! Ladies and gentlemen, I wonder who's going to grace us with his presence? Oh, Mr Hector Madden, star of The Hour. The face of the future! I haven't had the meeting yet. A star in the making. Sit down at my dinner table and let me tell you what is on the menu. HE LAUGHS Oh, don't. Sorry! Sorry! It is rather ridiculous. We had that funny little man that plays the banjo last week. What's his name? I told him the best things come in small packages. And he found it a hoot when I served him those little parcels of deliciousness. Your invention, that first night. You had one gas ring and nothing in your fridge, bar cheese and champagne and... Olives. Sorry. Oh, no, no, Alistair. Hector was just leaving. He's got a meeting with Uncovered. Top secret. Ah! Really? Good luck. Thank you. Oh! Give them your best. So, do you think that Scottish smoked salmon starter blows it too soon? We don't want to give it away! Disaster! We don't want what happened. Oh, Di Dors is back! Got bored of you, did he? Bugger off. Morning, Kiki. Where's Rosa? Holiday. Liar. Close the door, Mr Wengrow. We need to stop pursuing this. We need to stop it now. He murdered our source. All the more reason not to turn our backs on a story we've been trying to sell for weeks. She sent us that photograph. She didn't want us to stop. Oh, so we carry on until another girl is murdered? Shouldn't we go to the police? The police don't care. They're selling it as a racial attack. Perhaps it was. Cilenti warned us and he has made good on that warning. While the police hover, inert. We should talk to Stern. Absolutely not. Bullying is smoke, courage is fire. I am not listening to this. Don't back down now. We have rattled Mr Cilenti's cage. He corrupts our programme, by blackmailing his Westminster goon into feeding us a crafty backhanded scoop. We can expose McCain. And sink to the level of the gutter press? It's a good story, perhaps one of the most important stories. A blackmail racket that's already controlling one of Westminster's leading press agents. Who else is in his grip? Who else will he silence? But this is exactly my point. We should have run the story when we promised we would. It is too late now. We've put ourselves in too much danger. Well, you can run it, but I'm not. Come on. It's another form of subterfuge. A girl dies. We feel bad. And we stop asking the bigger question. What other strings is Mr Cilenti pulling? And I'm not talking about hostesses and seedy affairs. Isaac. I have looked into Tufnell Engineering. As we know, Mr Cilenti is a silent partner, but there is a buyer investing heavily in their shares. It's an offshore company, listed as Castlecore. I'll bet Castlecore's also connected to Cilenti. Bel... Bel. I leave it in your hands, Mr Lyon. Leave McCain to me. Go away. Don't do that. She's dead. I'm sorry. It's not right. It's very far from right, but we're journalists. This is what we do. We pursue the best story, the most important story. Oh, my God! This is just about you - spinning on the ice! If it exposes the unexposed, yes. If it gets the story, yes. Winning applause and a perfect score? Why not? What's wrong with that? Normally, they shoot the messenger. Yes, exactly. You are charging towards a loaded gun and you think you can miraculously dodge the bullet. Well, you can't. Not this time. You couldn't before. You left for ten months and only came back because Randall flattered your vanity and so you could show off your new wife. Another well-laid plan. Thank you! Has Camille come back from wherever she was? You look terrible. I'm fine. She's.. She's just with friends. Oh, Freddie! I don't want to talk about it. You just run through life scraping past injury. Nothing touches you. You pretend it does, but it doesn't. Not really. That girl... That girl sat in this office, in her best coat, and WE persuaded her to rush US information for a story that we didn't tell. So, tell it now! It's too late. She's dead! I want you to feel guilty. To feel like I feel. Like.. Like I've killed someone and I will never be able to look them in the eye and say, "I'm sorry". No! Miss Rowley... Isaac, not now! In the past... In the past, you WOULD have felt guilty. If I feel guilty, I stop being able to do what I do best. So I'm going to be excited. I'm excited. Be excited. For what? YOUR ambition? You didn't kill her. It's not your fault. Then whose fault is it? Rein this in, rein this in, now. You know what Freddie's like. This from the woman who was always first in and last out on any front line. Don't try that wry naivety with me, Randall. You know exactly what you are doing. Reckless, to the core. Paws off. That's Rosa's. Ain't you heard? She's dead?! She's dead. She must have been attacked on her way home. Don't upset yourself. It's very sad, but... Table four, lots of smiles tonight. Play your part. Yes. So what do you think? I take the offer very seriously. But I'm tremendously proud of what we're doing on The Hour. It's a very hard programme to leave. Chancellor scoop last week. I hope you were suitably lauded by your team. Always. Mr Satchell. You know Mr... Mr Madden, never miss your show. What can you promise us this week? We're toying with a story on the launch of CND. Your pro-nuclear arguments are winning votes, but raising a lot of fear in the anti-nuclear lobby. A frightfully arty lot, these CND people. A handful of renegades querying the debate. Along with 9,000 scientists, petitioning for a ban on nuclear testing only last month. Those same scientists who, in five years, will be thanking us for the medical discoveries made as a result of that testing. Isn't this really about who will be first to stick their flag on the moon? Someone get the camera now and get them in the studio. We're trying to convince Mr Satchell to come on the show. I believe we're trying to do the same thing. Do I sniff a Cold War? We'll be with you in five minutes, Mr Satchell. We're hoping for Macmillan the week after next. That's quite a coup. If the right man were in place. Someone with integrity. Someone with a weight to square off against seated across the desk. You've done this before. And we haven't even got to the small print yet. Sign now, Mr Madden. As fun as this is, we've laid out our shop. We can close it just as quick, if need be. No, that won't be necessary. So, we are agreed? Talk to my agent. She can firm up the details by end of today. Good. Does Miss Rowley know you're here? Only if you told her. I did not. She's obviously not sleeping with the right people. Shall I show you the dressing rooms? Er... another time. Can't be late for Marnie. Rumour has it she gets more fan mail than Noddy. You must be very proud. Yes, I am. A man goes to the doctor - "Doctor, there's a monster under my bed." Doctor says, "There's nothing I can do. It's all in your head." Next week, the doctor passes the man in the street and says, "Good day. You look remarkably well." Man says, "Last night, I slept like a baby." Doctor's amazed. "What did you do?" "Well, I looked again, I saw that monster, "so I just cut the legs off my bed." You're saying this because you think I'm frightened? We all have different ways of dealing with our fear. I just don't want anyone else to lose their life over this story. That way, madness lies. No man is sane who doesn't know how to be insane on the proper occasions. Madness is a prerequisite for any good journalist. Come in, Mr Lyon. Police stations make me nervous. I was about to leave. But I caught you before you did. Such bravado, Mr Lyon. Miss Ramirez's death. Miss Ramirez? She worked at El Paradis. Found dead in an alleyway this morning. Yes. Doesn't it make you angry? Doesn't a death on your watch make you angry? Yes, of course it does. There is a story that we will run. You can choose to do something. If you do, we may be able to overlook your major indiscretion... a police officer who beats girls, then desperately tries to hide it. How many years would you get for that? I suppose one can't arrest oneself. Your refusal to curb Mr Cilenti's backroom dealings, his blatant corruption... I presume he has a number of officers in his pocket, as well as you? Any internal corruption, I can assure you, has been dealt with. Transfers I've made over the last few weeks have put paid to any period of leniency to Cilenti and colleagues. Go one better. Arrest him. Before he can kill anyone else. Everyone loves a hero, don't they, Mr Stern? But the person who loves him most of all, I tend to find, is the hero himself. Why else would he polish his buttons so shiny? Commander Stern? We are going to expose Cilenti? You know we will do that? And when we've finished exposing Cilenti, Mr Stern, the failures of your force will come to light. You know, we're all polishing buttons, Mr Lyon, otherwise, why would you be pursuing this story with such fervour? You talk of my ambition, when all I can see is your own. Take care. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Name That Dinner Guest, the programme where you, the audience, must guess who I'm cooking for today. Well, he has worked his way into all our hearts and if you slice him, you will find Wales to the core. Now, the most important thing about lamb is that you mustn't be afraid of it. You need a sharp knife and a lot of pluck, to bone the haunch. Would you excuse me just for a brief moment? Mr Brown. Sit down. I didn't think you frequented this Westminster tavern. I don't. That's you. Oh, Christ. Although another man might be sorely tempted to take your money or to use this against you, I hope that we, at The Hour... "We"? Christ. Christ. Christ. ..are more fixated on the tale of the news story, rather than financial gain. Sent anonymously to Miss Rowley. The Chancellor story. It was a good scoop and my simple attempt... to make amends to Mr Madden. You failed. At the NATO summit in December there was a man called Mr Francis Tufnell. He owns Tufnell Engineering. They have newly won the contract to supply the British missile bases with air conditioning units and the like. A long-term associate of Mr Cilenti, it seems. How did they get that deal? Did you broker a meeting? Who are Castlecore? Pick it up. How do you plan to use this? I don't. Blackmail is an insidious crime. It casts a shadow across the most private of intimacies. And one should imagine, must make one so very tired. Yes. If you... change your mind... They've been working on a deal. It's ready to be signed tonight. They will be in El Paradis. They? Who's they? Where have you been? Nowhere. Mr Wengrow? Darling, do you really want to keep this up? It's the cost, Lix. It's the cost of what we do. That girl was dumped in a back alley just for talking to us. Does it not weigh heavy on you? Am I the only one? I refuse to become immune to the consequences of what we do. We may work in a man's world, but I will not become as brutal as them. And this is why we won the vote? Ah, ah! Is that real? Are we getting married? Popped the question this morning. Congratulations! Sissy, that's wonderful. Maybe we should all find ourselves a nice doctor. Now there's an idea. Let's marry the whole office off! Miss Rowley. We've got the civil defence film this afternoon. Shall I... Yes, thank you, Sissy. You're late. I'm so sorry, Dotty. We overran and then Alistair insisted I stay and chat to this frightfully dull man from Bisto, determined that I should be plugging his gravy on the programme. Now, it does add a certain bite to a consomme, but it simply does not stand alone. So... what did they say? They want you. Joint contract. Oooh, didn't I say, Hector, didn't I say? Alistair hinted as much. Dotty, you are a marvel! Calm down, dear girl. No need to inflate. What are they offering? 12 months. Plus advertising revenue. Advertising? Soap. Custard powder. Mr Bisto. That might be a link-up for you both. Isn't that marvellous, darling? I want to read it first. Of course. Better have the plaice. Steamed. You need to watch your figure. I wasn't talking about your wife. Mr Madden, Civil defence film. All to attend. Really? What, now? BBC initiative. All departments have been asked to view it. Nice of you to join us. Have you, er... read about Miss Ramirez? I'm so sorry. It's my fault. No it's not. I brought in the McCain scoop. Hector, look. What's this? At last there's a firm that's taking the manufacture of anti-nuclear shelter seriously. There has to be everything to make it possible to stay down there until the fall-out's dispersed and it's safe to come up. What a marvellous place to play in. When the warning system has given the alarm, there's complete protection against fall-out as soon as father closes the hatch. Preparing for an H bomb exercise... Stock went up in Tufnell Engineering. Straight after the summit. Castlecore bought up as many shares as they could before the missile base's contract was signed. It was a tip off? Government have their fingers all over it. It's insider trading. You buy quickly on the nod and sell just as fast as soon as the share price reaches its peak, which I'd say is about now. Gosh, one could buy a minor country with the loose change from the sale of these shares. Tufnell and Castlecore are blatantly profiteering from the arms race. Do you have any other names? Perhaps who's heading Castlecore? There's a Swiss bank account.. Brick wall. Then how to get them? Randall? You might try El Paradis. McCain seems confident that Castlecore are meeting there to sign an important deal tonight. Is that all McCain gave us? We work with what we have. You might want to gather your troops. This may be your only opportunity to see who's involved. What are you doing in the dark? Trying to find a safe place. Every office needs to mark a safe place to hide in the event of a nuclear attack. Well, we won't all fit in here. Maybe if we took out the shelves? It won't help, Sissy. We'll be toast. No-one's going to survive. Don't say that. What's the matter with you today? They're recording my play. Now. Right now. And I'm in a cupboard. Not that I don't like being in a cupboard with you. Well, aren't you going to say anything? The ring? Yes. KNOCKS ON DOOR Ready? Yes, just, er... just give me a minute. Do you think it's a bit odd if we walk out together? You go first. Good. Good. Don't be nervous. No, I'm not. Well, I am, a bit. Well, we're just going to go to the embassy and ask them to verify that she is who she is. Then, at some point, if she would like, we could... Yes. I know where you've been. How was the interview? Marnie... Yes? Marnie's very keen I make the move to ITV. Of course. It could be very good for us. I can see that. Dotty's optimistic. There are a number of opportunities, in the future and.. Did Bill not... No. Well, I've been a pretty awful husband. She's a remarkably good wife. Together we're dynamite apparently! The golden couple. Perhaps that might be fun. I can at least give Marnie that. I can't give her children. She doesn't know yet but, er... seems that the problem is with me. So I was hoping the move might soften the blow. Oh, Hector. So I'll serve out the rest of my contract and then... I haven't told Randall yet. No, of course. But I am going to sign. You're terribly angry. Furious. I've had the best 18 months of my career with the best team. So stay. Damn you, Hector. It's not you. Why did you have to tell me something so sad? Oh, best not. She... she didn't even have a family. No-one... no-one came to collect the body. I telephoned and I sent flowers but... she isn't even having a funeral. And all Freddie cares about... God, he's so frustrating! He really is! Well, don't smile. Why are you laughing? Because for someone so brutally honest with everyone else, you display such blatant deceit when it comes to yourself. Freddie's... Back. I hear his wife is still away. Well, you always did have a penchant for the married man. Are you, um... actually working today? Yes, actually... Going through tomorrow's show. Then I'm leaving. Cuban Revolution. Castro's new front. He's calling on the government to make a stand, flush out corruption. Britain has agreed to supply arms for the opposition. It'll go after CND and the alliance. And I thought we should start looking at Little Rock and de-segregation. Uncovered are vying for Satchell. Really? Isaac, call Satchell again. We need him on the show to oppose CND. Hector, El Paradis, tonight. No. Hector, you say "no". I'm not asking you to come, just letting you know in case... In case we find you with a bullet to your head?! So dramatic. Really? You know what they do with their unwanted guests? I promised I'd pick Marnie up for dinner. What are you doing? I'm meeting Bill. You don't want to meet Bill. You want to come out with me. No, I want to go for a civilised evening with a civilised man. I don't know what this is about. I don't know why you're behaving like this. It's scared you. I understand that, but this isn't you? How do you know what's me? Because I do. Someone in a position of power is profiteering from this nuclear race. I want to know who Castlecore is and I think you do too. I'm going out with Bill. And Bel. The flowerpot men. It's not funny. It is. It's very funny. Cut you to your core, you'll find news running through your spine. Stuff dinner. Come with me. Oh, jump when you want me, you have a wife for that. It's over... It's, um... it's just over with me and Camille. Freddie... I'm not missing her. I'm not missing Camille. I want to. I know that I should, but I'm not. I should go. I...I miss you. I miss YOU more. I, um... I wrote you two letters. One from San Diego. One from New York. And I said... Freddie... Just get on a plane. Just get on a plane and come. And I said... And you... you didn't write back. And I told myself, of course, it's because you love news more. That doing this will always be more important than any man. So I will see you tonight, at El Paradis. Because this is what we do. Mr and Mrs Brown. Yes. Good afternoon. Hello. I lied. Just, just go with it. Yes. So we have a name... Malfrande with an 'e'. No, no, no. It's Malfrand without an 'e'. There's no 'e'. Lazy filing. I will call again. We have had a copy of her passport through. Oui. Allo. C'est Madame Duval a I'appareil. Oui. Le passport que nous avons commande de... de Mademoiselle Malfrande. C'etait bien sur avec un 'e' la fin? C'est ce que j'avais pense. It's the wrong date. Alors, je les ai aupres de moi, je les informerai. Merci, au revoir. No, no. You've made a mistake. When I called, I said she was born on the 24th of June. Yes, and... and this says the 24th of July. Sh... She was born on the 24th June. There are always false trails. Of course. Yes. One must not give up hope. You ready? You coming? Yes. Strength in numbers. Thank you, Mr Madden. I need to see Marnie first. You know, it would look better if we had Marnie with us. Oh, no. Congratulations. He's a lucky chap. Thank you, Isaac. Bill... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Hellish day? Oh, just a bit. I've ordered some wine. How was your day? Good. Fine. You? Freddie's off on some mad antic. He'll be fine. I hope he'll be fine. Maybe he won't. Who knows with Freddie? Hector will keep him in line. Has Hector told you yet? I'm sorry. It's what he wants. No-one likes to lose a member of their team. I knew it was coming. I just hope he reads the small print. It might be better if he didn't. He'll be with Uncovered for six months at most. It's not that we don't want him, it's that Entertainment want him more. He's a face now, and that increases his value to them. The irony is the more he's worth to them, the less choice he'll have. They're a brand. What shall we eat? You're delighted! No. Composing my obituary already. No. Not quite yet... but it's bloody brilliant. Is it? You don't sound very sure. I'm not. But if you want to convince me. Do you know what The Hour can do with the money they spend on you? You're a very expensive racehorse and now we can buy two geldings. I've already talked to Randall about it. Bastard! What, were you expecting some kind of lament? I will not lament a man who has a long road of selling Brylcreem ahead of him. You'll make a bloody fortune! Evening, girls. Evening, Mr Cilenti. Let's pick it up tonight, yes? Give them something to remember. All right, Miss Delaine? Good girl. Oh! Sorry. I was just trying out some flan cases. Thank you. I like to tidy up myself at the end of the night. Make sure everything is in order. So I thought Caprice. Now, Alistair said we'd never get a table, but I said call and say my name, and voila - table at eight. Darling, I can't. I have to work late. Of course. I'll take a taxi. Really, it's fine. Come with me. If you like. Where are you going? El Paradis. Freddie thinks there's a story. I'm sure. Oh, Christ, Marnie, it's work. Freddie's waiting in the car. If I'm going to step into that club again, I'd rather it was with my wife. Right, don't wait up. Hector. Do they serve dinner? I'm starving. You were a fantastic drunk. It has been said. I'm too old to change. Why not drink? We might all die tomorrow. But I don't want to die without knowing what happened to her. They'll find her. Why didn't you just let me sleep, Randall? Why did you have to... come back and wake me up? Give me hope? Hope is all we have. Randall. That's a start. Smile for the camera. â™ª Betcha getcha, very soon â™ª It won't take a shiny moon... â™ª Good evening, Mr Cilenti. Mr Lyon. Mr Madden. You find us a little subdued this evening, Mrs Madden. A terrible tragedy. You might have read. Yes. We lost one of our girls. Yes, I'm so sorry. Please. Some might think it respectful after such a death to close the club for a night, Mr Cilenti. And then, where would all my guests go? We'd miss you so, Mr Lyon, if you were gone. When are you going to invite me to dinner, Mrs Madden? Oh, veal escalope with capers on the side and for dessert... No, dessert... Oh, quel dommage. I'm afraid we only have this corner table. That'll be fine. What are you doing with this man? Everything. Dangerous place for foreigners, don't you think? The streets of London? Well, I wouldn't know... as a British citizen. Enjoy your night. Freddie. What exactly do we do when we find Castlecore? Don't know yet. Maybe I will when we find out who they are. There's one or two familiar faces. Mrs Madden. Thanks. You just need to keep smiling. Jane couldn't sleep last night. She has nightmares. She wakes bolt upright and I have to sit with her until she falls back to sleep. She says, "Where shall we go when the bomb drops, Daddy? "Shall we go under the stairs?" And I always say, "The bomb won't drop, darling, "because the nice men at Westminster will have their finger on the button first. "The bad men wouldn't dare." You should have told Jane that when the bomb drops we won't know. I need to be somewhere. I'm sorry? I need to be somewhere else. May I have my coat, please? Now? Yes. I'm so sorry, now. I need to be with Freddie. He needs me. Mr Lyon. Is all we have now that you've peeled Hector away. Thank you. Prego. You are angry. No, I'm not, I'm really not. I just... I can't do this. I can't be this. Yes, you can. There's more to life than chasing history. No, there isn't. The truth is something you don't have to lie about. You should have told Jane there won't be any time to press that button. That's the point. That's the idiot lie. There isn't time. It's now. Minister for Trade to the left. Oh, he's a frightful bore. Got stuck next to him at a dinner once. Outspoken critic of everything. Thinks we give too much to pensions and not enough to education. Cites the American model as inspirational. Pro nuclear. That Lawson to his right? Undersecretary to... Foreign office. Tufnell's here. If McCain's right, we're en route to Castlecore. I don't know what anyone's talking about. The trick is to make it look like you do. Watch where he sits. Nice table. Who's he waiting for? â™ª ..A merry go round. â™ª Will you excuse me? I must go to the ladies'. It's lavender scented. Good for a cold. Bel. I knew you'd come. Don't wear that one out. You're very pretty. Thank you. Why did you accuse my husband? Was it revenge? Because I'll give you a little tip. Success is the best revenge. It really is. You shouldn't waste yourself on anything else. You're too pretty for it. Miss Rowley, may I help you? Oh, I was just looking for the ladies. Let me show you. Please. It's good to see you again. You know, I watch you ladies primping and preening and I often ask myself, "What's it for?" Because underneath all that lipstick and perfume, flesh and bone, you women are all the same... showgirls and whores. Bel. We are on a stake out. He's watching us. Calm. Oh! Hector, good evening. Marnie. Mr Lyon. Miss Rowley. All here. We are. May I introduce Vera? Hello. Hello, Vera. Hello, Vera. Nice to meet you. Lovely. And perhaps you would like to go and be seated, my dear? Angus, I thought you'd give this place a wide birth. Well, you know the thing with El Paradis... you are no-one unless you are here. So when one wants to be photographed, perhaps with some new young lady friend, then, this is quite simply the best place to be. I do hope you've had some luck with Castlecore. Angus, who is Castlecore? You are looking at Castlecore. Satchell? He's the king of the castle. Excuse me. War is a game played with a smile. Mr Madden. Twice in one day. Indeed. You've met Marnie and the team. This is the man who gave me a good pasting when he wasn't even interviewing me. Unfortunately, I have decided to say yes, to Uncovered. Very flattered that The Hour has been chasing me, but felt they were the... safer option. Wait for it... Wait for it... Five... four... three... two... one. Bingo. Now, let's prove he's involved. I need to get closer in. How? You'll see. Good evening, Miss. Now, Sir? Not yet. Your very own secretary, Mr Cilenti. Yes, take a letter, Miss Delaine. They will kill you. Now! This is a raid! Bel! Get out now. Freddie, no. You have to... Hector, take everyone out now. Freddie! Come on! Freddie! Laurie. Laurie. Go home! How dare you? You gutter press. Stoop down too low, be careful what you might find, Mr Lyon. You thief. Murderer. Mr Lyon, go home. Raphael Cilenti, I am arresting you for living off immoral earnings and for questioning in relation to the murder of Miss Rosa Ramirez. No Detective Attwood? Glasgow. Transferred. Take him out. Come on! Bel. Quickly. Hell. Yes. That was scandalous! It was a conflict of interest, surely? Satchell, the most pro-nuclear voice in our cabinet blatantly profiteering from the spoils of the Cold War? Well, there's your story. We can't sell an assumption. So we get more evidence. We get it first and we get it right. Could you come with me, please? Miss Delaine, I am arresting you for soliciting. I'm going to pick up my bag now. And I'm going to leave out that back door. And you are not going to stop me. My parting gift. I hope you all go to hell. We're clear, Sir. Sir? Give me your stick. I don't want to sleep. I can't sleep. Erm... I, I want to walk. What, now? Yes, I want to walk. I want to be outside in the cold. Hector, will you stop the car, I'll walk from here. Well, you can't go on your own. I'll walk with you. Thank you. 8am tomorrow. I presume it's your last day. Read the small print before you sign. Promise me you'll do that. I'm shaking. If it all ends tomorrow... Yes? I don't want to leave without saying that... Without saying what? Um... Oh, let's, let's just walk. I've put another sheet out for you. The other one had a hole. Thank you. That was quite a night. Is it always like that? No, not always. I understand why you love it so. Good night, Marnie. Hector... Do you think you'll be happy? Do you think it's all going to be all right? Marnie. Dotty's right, you know, you have a face for entertainment. Don't waste it on earthquakes in China and... political whatnot in Guadeloupe. Everyone thinks so. Do they? Because, in spite of everything... I do want you to be happy. Darling. It's too cold to sleep on the sofa bed tonight. Is this all right? Yes, darling. Westminster are running scared. It's a sex scandal to cover a nuclear scandal. Mr Pike tells me The Hour have been sniffing around you. You don't have to be afraid. Like Rosa didn't have to be afraid? I've already saved your life once. And I've been grateful for far too long. There are just times when one becomes weary of hiding things. Are you saying that you want to help us? Expose it all. Who else is implicated? Who isn't, Sir. We don't run this story, who will? Three, two, one. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.
