 The Hour (2011–2012): Season 2, Episode 2 - Episode #2.2 - full transcript 
 Whilst Marnie gets a job as a television chef and is considered an ideal housewife,Hector is arrested for beating up Kiki. With nobody else anxious to help him Bel does some sleuthing at the El Paradis club and finds that Kiki poses for nude photos and suspects that perhaps she was assaulted by a jealous boyfriend. She is right but he is very high profile and when Hector is released he is unaware of his identity. Nonetheless Hector returns to the club after Marnie has told him that from now on theirs will be a marriage in name only. Freddie courts controversy by announcing that,given the current climate of colour prejudice,he will host a discussion between Sissy's boyfriend,black doctor Ola and a boy with fascist leanings. The doctor's eloquence humiliates the racist and the broadcast is deemed a success. Randall warns Bill Kendall off trying to poach Hector but Bel finds herself being charmed by Bill.

 'The last nine months have been an exercise in maintaining 'the direction and morale of The Hour.' Ten minutes, ladies and gentlemen. We have a new Head of News to impress. Uncovered are snapping at your heels. Mr Kendall, Uncovered. ITV. Thank you Mr, McCain. Tighter. Newer. Fresher. And also, I presume, with a presenter who's on time. Shut it down and board it up. Let's go! May I introduce Commander Stern, soon to be Deputy Commissioner. Last night confirmed that Mr Madden needs backup. Mr Lyon! As new co-host? You didn't know. When you're away, you long for the things you left behind.

 I will not apologise and I will not talk about the past. Is that clear? So, what is your name? Miss Delaine. Kiki Delaine. I'm an actress. Oh, a performer! So delighted to meet you. Freddie has spoken so much of you. And this is my wife. JAUNTY MUSIC PLAYS Must you? The guests haven't even arrived. DOORBELL RINGS One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four... Miss Delaine in yet? No.

 Miss Ramirez, be ready. You might need to go on if Kiki's late. Yes, Mr Cilenti. Where are you from? Costa Rica. Seven, eight. One, two... BIG BAND MUSIC PLAYS ANIMATED CHATTER Thank you again for tonight. You're welcome. Thank you. Sissy? No, he's too shy. I work late every night. Come into the studio tomorrow, during the day, let me tele-record you. You're a coloured doctor. Don't tell me you haven't had a white patient reluctant to be treated by you. You stick to your job, I'll stick to mine. Sissy, persuade him, please. I can't. I've tried. Hell! We're late. Come on. Oi! Be careful. Yeah, go on. Go home. Got a cigarette? SMOOTH MUSIC PLAYS ANIMATED CHATTER How was the Chameleon Club? Fine. Amazing! We got so many beautiful interviews. Beautiful is not always interesting. Oh, clubs like these offer a positive view of immigration. Part of a brilliant anti-fascist initiative. But it's not a story if we don't also direct the camera at the other side. Show the hatred, the fury towards these visitors. Two days back, I come down, there's graffiti on our front door because a young black man's moved in downstairs. They're just boys. I see them on the street every day. Ripe for Mr Mosley's cause. Or The Hour. No. We'd be playing into Mosley's hands. If we let them join the debate on immigration... We'll be giving Mosley's offensive views the airtime he dearly wants. Give him the rope to hang himself, if he wants. The BBC never broadcasts those views and they won't start now. Hatred festers if ignored. Don't patronise the public. Let them decide. We're recording in front of the board tomorrow. I'll certainly be curious to see what they have say. Well, I for one, shall boycott it. Never! And let me take centre stage? Boys! Don't worry. They do this all the time. Let me show you notre maison. God! Miss Delaine. This way. It was the first night. Mother Courage. Have you ever seen it? No. Brecht makes me want to cut my throat. But I imagine in French, it's much improved. I thought you didn't like theatre. I do a bit. We stayed up until dawn and then ate breakfast on the bank of the... The Seine? Oui. Then I read him one of my poems and when I look at him, he is crying. It's very polluted, apparently, the Seine. So, how are you finding married life? Spectacular. I love the house. It was where Freddie was born. I like that. Like his parents are still in the bones. But he's a terrible husband. He works all the time. Miss Rowley, please make sure he's at home by seven every night. Well, you marry the man, you marry the job. Well, then, I must insist he resign. Good idea. I'll expect your letter on my desk in the morning. PHONE RINGS Oh, I'll get that on my way out. Is it that time? Adieu, adieu. I'll be back in a moment. You don't like her. No. No. She's... She's just very French. You don't like her. It doesn't matter. I like her. Presumably that's why you married her. And Sartre? You've never read Sartre in your life! Yes, I have. No, you haven't. Yes, I have. And Kerouac. And Ginsberg. You should read Ginsberg. You'd like Ginsberg. Fine. KNOCK AT DOOR Excuse me, ma'am, is Mr Madden in? We'd like you to come down to the police station, please, sir. And what's he done? I'd rather not say, ma'am. Hector? Is there some problem, Officer? Some charge? Allegations of an attack have been made against you, sir. By whom? A young lady. Oh, my God! Hector! Probably best if you come now. I just need to get my... What do I tell everyone? Tell them the office telephoned, a story's broken. Hector...? You follow in the car. Mr Lyon will drive you. No! The lavatory's at the end. Ring Commander Stern. Marnie will give you the number. Someone has taken leave of their senses. Miss Delaine, I'm sorry that you've been hurt in any way. But your profession is such... I'm an actress. I'm not... Yes, well, I apologise. But it is your word against Mr Madden's, a very well-respected and successful man. Did he punch you? Yes. I would describe it as punching. And was there any other kind of weapon? No. His fist was enough. Were there any witnesses? No. It was early. Was it light outside? Yes. But you said it was night. He's not the only one I could talk about. You wouldn't believe what some of these important men get up to in their private time. They don't care for the consequences. Where's my wife? The charges are... Ridiculous. They're bloody, bloody ridiculous! You don't believe I'm capable of something as despicable as this? I'm struggling to understand why she's doing it. Let me talk to her. No. No, I can do what I can, but I cannot rush this through simply because I'm the Commander. Such allegations have to be seriously investigated. The lies of an actress? She's a singer I picked up in a club. You are honestly going to take her word over mine? I had intimate relations with her, but I did not hurt her in any way. I saw you that night. I told you to go home to your wife. Don't lecture me, Laurie, you're not married. What goes on between a husband and wife... It's been difficult. It's been very difficult for some time. But after, I did go home. What time? It was dark. I don't know. Around two. Marnie can confirm that. I came home. I woke her when I went to bed. Where the hell she is...? Christ, Hector! I didn't bloody do it, Laurie! You more than anyone know I'd never do that. Why is this woman lying?! What if she goes to the press? Madness! Where is she? Where the hell is Marnie? PHONE RINGS No. It was the 8th. We were doing Sputnik Two. I had to go to a terrible engagement party. He was late the next morning. Hungover. I'd just got back. God! He didn't do it! I hope you're right. Freddie? Well, even if he did not do it, which in my marrow, I want to believe, there is a girl in there who says he did. She's lying! Why? A grudge, or...? Or? Perhaps he told her he'd leave Marnie. They'd spend their life together. Perhaps... When your wife doesn't show, it is a bad sign. Don't! Beyond this girl's statement, we need to ask questions. Has she done this before? Find the evidence. Find the flaw in her statement. What the hell am I going tell Randall? What's she saying? She claims he attacked her after a night at El Paradis. The irony is I was with him that same night. I wish now I'd stayed. They're very serious allegations. Um, can we...can we see him? Five minutes. One of you. Um...I'll, I'll be back. I'll be there. Go home and...and change. Camille will be... Yeah. I'll see you back at the office. The board are in at three. She's not coming? Oh, my God! Could...could she have gone to her parents' house? No. She wouldn't want to upset the apple cart yet. I-I could call by the house. She's given up on me. No. I didn't do it. No, I know. I know you didn't. I'm supposed to be presenting this NATO... It doesn't matter! Let's just concentrate on getting you out. Think back to that evening. This girl, after El Paradis...? We went to a hotel in Mayfair. Oh, Christ! No time for self-pity now, Hector. You know you didn't do it. (We just have to find out who did.) Oh, God! Oi! Now you fit in. HE IMITATES A MONKEY Mrs Lyon. Come on, come on. PHONE RINGS Hello. The Hour. Hello. This is Bill Kendall. Could I speak to Mr Madden, please? No, you can't. I heard you like to have your fingers over everything, Miss Rowley, but I did not realise that extended to answering the telephone. It's hard to get good people, I like to hold on to the ones I've got. He's not here. Odd. We had a meeting this morning. He didn't turn up. Unbelievable! You're telephoning to flaunt your sad attempts to poach my staff. I'd concentrate on finessing Uncovered. It could do with it. And she does jokes, as well. Obviously, you're going with the imminent NATO summit? Obviously. That's all you're getting. I'll go first. Only the second time since '49 all the heads of government have met. You will be anti-military. Don't make assumptions. Yes, I'm right. Well, in an atmosphere of insanity, where the President of the United States may not make the summit... Macmillan is naturally nervous. The question is, will Eisenhower plant his missiles in Britain? Does Eisenhower even have a plan? Where from? His sick bed? It's a poker game being played by lunatics and invalids. Have dinner with me. And now you're flirting with me. Openness, Miss Rowley, on all fronts, is always my preferred policy. Although clearly not in your marriage. How would your wife feel if you were asking me out? Or is this business? Sorry, I never finish before nine. At best, it's a bag of chips on the way home. Now, if you'll please excuse me, more pressing matters. You all right there, sir? Lovely. My fella's going to show you... Oh! Excuse me, excuse me. Mr Lyon, Mr Lyon! New car, Norman? Yeah, it is, it is. How are you, Mr Lyon? Fine, thank you. And your wife? Er...after the incident? She recovered? What? Nasty little thug got her on the doorstep. They don't like us shifting the coloureds in. Don't worry. We're on the look-out. They don't understand. Where else are our visitors meant to stay? Mr Lyon? It's no wonder people like yourselves are moving out the city to the new towns. She's fine. She's fine. A little shaken. I gave her a brandy. Christ! I told Sissy to tell your office. I'll come in today. I'll do your interview. Mr Pike. They say you're a doctor, Mr Ola. Yes. Ah, your mother must be so proud. Yeah? One second. Hello, sir. I'll help you in there. I hate this country. Don't hate this country. I live in this country. And you love me. Was it the same lad? Yeah. Freddie, wait! Oi! You! Here we go! Think it's funny? Picking on a woman. Piss off! How old are you? 17. I remember you. You used to deliver my dad's paper. Yeah? Proud of you, I'm sure. Letting out his house to that blacko. Looking out his window at his neighbours, everyone's a nig! What would your dad think of that, then? You tell me. Mosley says we just need to buy more sugar from Jamaica, instead of trading with Cuba. Then they can all go back to where they came from. Riddin' Britain of the nigs! Darkies live on cat food, I've seen 'em. "A prophet or an achiever "must never mind an occasional absurdity. "It is an occupational risk." Do you actually understand what you just said? Yeah. Fancy saying all that on television? The Chameleon Club piece. Erm...a positive view of the interracial social clubs that are popping up across London. Examining the face of modern immigration and the growth of the anti-fascist movement in the light of violence on the streets. Let's hope it will play well in front of the board. 3pm. Our budget's under review. Yes. I haven't forgotten. Mr Lyon? Mr Madden? They here? On their way. Cocktail dress. Have I missed a party? Sissy, telephone Mrs Madden. She's proving elusive. Tell her I need to speak to her as soon as possible. PHONE RINGS Where is everyone? And why are you still in evening dress? Sissy, try McCain's office when you've finished trying Mrs Madden. Out with it. We're in trouble. Major or minor? BOTH: Go away! Hector's, um...Hector's been arrested. He's been accused of beating some young girl. Where? El Paradis. I'm going there now. Munchkin, it's better left to the police. He didn't do it! Heroes or villains, we are all somewhere in between. The good do bad things and the bad are sometimes kind to their mothers. Delaine. Kiki Delaine? Do you know that name? Am I to assume that she's a call girl? Why would someone, anyone, lie about something like that? Rich men come in every day, treating them like dirt. One day, one of them's bound to lash out. He didn't do it. Jolly good, sweetheart, mustn't give power to doubt. Freddie in? Randall's sniffing around. McCain? He's not in until twelve. Keep trying. He needs to go to West End Central Police station. Miss Rowley...? And Freddie, tell him to knock that fascist story into shape. You want to let the stupid Nazi kid on the television? Yes. You are inhumane. Some might say the opposite. Neither vilify nor condone. Aren't you interested? Intrigued? Intrigued? You have no passion. You don't care! I'm sorry. It was soot. It was horrible. I'm sorry. But do nothing and he will come back again. Give him the rope to hang himself. Let's hear what he has to say. You don't love me. What? You love your stupid Hour! Conard! Egoiste! You keep telling me to stand taller. What's taller than this?! SHE YELLS IN FRENCH She won't withdraw the charges. We're keeping her as long as we can. The last thing we need is her talking to the tabloid press. Will she want money? How much does she want? I have money. The minute you start writing cheques, you're a guilty man. Now, for Christ's sake, you are innocent. Pull yourself together. It's all such a mess! I'm sure Marnie will help you. She's not here, Laurie. And to be frank, she stopped trusting me a long time ago. We both know with good reason. This girl... This girl is one of many stupid mistakes I've made. Now, are you sure you left and it was dark? It was night. If Marnie won't, then we need to find McCain. McCain saw me leave. He was there. He'll vouch for me. Christ, Laurie, I can't even hold the bloody thing! Always could rely on you. Hollandaise. As early as 1651, the great cook Francois Pierre Le Varenne described a sauce very similar to this delicious concoction of butter and eggs. Avec du bon beurre frais, et un jaune d'oeuf pour lier la sauce. And there you have it. Voila! Oh! Quelle desastre! Perhaps one more time? No. That was terrific, Mrs Madden. Perhaps if you'd like to join us over here. Yes, of course. I'll just... Mrs Madden? Yes? Duck...or a swan? Vai a volare l'uccellino piccolina. You walk like Bacall. Thank you. I understand that Mr Madden is often here. You his wife? No. His producer. Ah. Nice. Er...he's in custody, An incident with a young lady he met in this club. That's unfortunate. These girls work for you. What they do in their own time is no business of mine. But it is mine. I have no front man. People say I have a face for television. They're wrong. Cute! She's saying that he assaulted her. HE SIGHS These girls are little birds. They're fragile in these men's hands. All you can do is advise and guide. We have stars, politicians, diplomats here. They come to relax. The rest... This is a nice place. Elegant place. The other stuff... That's not this place. They are very serious allegations. If you have any idea who might... I'm a businessman. Miss Delaine... So you know her name. ..is such a sweet girl. She's one of my best. But ambition gets us all. She's like a daughter to me. The kind of girl that can stir the emotions of a man. Who did it? Ha! Who did it? A man who folds his own napkins and you don't keep track of your own investments? I bet you have a past. I bet you do, too. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH FOOTSTEPS RECEDE Now, what is key to us is that the viewer is meeting not only a hostess, but a woman totally in charge of the home. In your own life, Mrs Madden, your husband is a very successful man. So, what is the secret to your marriage? I'm sure every wife wonders what her husband does with his day. So when he does pass through that door, one must try to make him feel loved. Give him no reason to stray from the hearth and comfort of family life. You have children? No, but we hope to soon. Your husband must be very proud of you. Absolutely. If you could just perhaps give us a few moments to deliberate, Mrs Madden. Yes, of course. Um...do you have a light? Thank you. Kiki's got a lot of friends. Do you know any of them? I hear she's an actress. Yes. Yes, Miss Delaine's a very good actress. Theatre? Film? More...artistic photographs. You can pick them up in any of the speciality bookshops around here. If you know how to ask. Do you know who attacked her? Whoever it was didn't like those photos. I like your hair. What dye do you use? Silver ash or American birch? Neither. Mr Wengrow? Miss Rowley, on your travels, seen her around? I have. And Mr Lyon? Present and correct. Ready for this afternoon? Yes. I just need to sort... We have contributors. Very interesting contributors coming in. Contributors? Mm-hm. Sissy! Why are you following me? Update. NATO summit. Still going with the anti-military angle. Any sense as to what Uncovered are running with? They're less interested in the summit as a forum for political debate. As to be expected. Miss Cooper. Mr Madden? Newsroom. Just now? Yes. That's odd. I was just there. Shall we go back there and see what he thinks? How's Mrs Lyon? Sey told me. Fine. Fine. She's fine, thank you. Is, um...Miss Rowley back yet? No. This afternoon, there will be a young man coming in. What, Sey? Yes, I know. No. No, Someone else. Who? I'm just, er...firming up the details. Isaac's writing a play. What kind of play? Domestic, in a way. Kitchen sink. In that genre. You haven't written it yet? I have a title. Get me 20 pages by the end of the week. I'll read it for you. Oh, Mr Lyon, I hope you don't think me rude, it's just a very different kind of writing. The dramatic form. And Mr Mackie in drama said he'd give it the once-over. Really? But thanks for the offer. It's just he's a bit experienced. Yeah, and he's published. FREDDIE CHUCKLES You lost, love? So...I've been summoned. Hm. Randall... You've been sniffing around my team. I'd rather you didn't do that. Mr Madden's the best out there. You'll ruin his career. You'll give him six months on Uncovered, then he'll be earmarked for light entertainment. He'll be in a sparkly suit, spinning a cardboard roulette wheel on a quiz show by next Christmas. I can assure you, I want Mr Madden for more than his croupier skills. He is highly corruptible. I'm sure he'll take whatever is offered. He's also very self-destructive. Brilliant people often are. Too much money is bad for him. That's why I'd rather you didn't. And if I do? Your producer has already said she'll hunt me down. That's covered, then. Good luck. I'm sure she'll take you a few rounds. May I help you? I'm looking for some literature... For my husband. Sorry? Something artistic? I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean. I think you do. Let me have a look... Yes. Thank you. What I can tell you is that he was clearly very drunk. I left. I presume he stayed. What happened thereafter... your guess is as good as mine. Erm, however... I have been very worried about Mr Madden of late. He's not been himself. The great pity with London is that... with all its...exotic flavours, er... a man such as Mr Madden can so easily be lead astray. Thanks for that. I thought Hector was a friend of yours... You know he's not capable of this. I will say whatever is needed to... preserve my position, Commander. What is more I will ensure that if my name is even mentioned outside the interview room... this story will be in the press by the end of the day. Now you wouldn't want your association with Mr Madden to... impair your future? After all, I hear you are earmarked for Commissioner. I presume I will see you tonight at the McClaren ball? Good, good. Sissy...did you get Mr... Drayton? A cup of tea? No. I don't know what you were thinking of, Mr Lyon, but I'm not telling Sey that you want to put him on with a fascist. Isaac, would you see Mr Drayton down to the set, please? Dr Ola? Good afternoon. This way, please. So, Miss Cooper's young man is coming in? Yes. That's right. Interesting... One of Mr Lyon's contributors? I believe so. So let's run that after the summit. Because in truth, the BBC board members are only here to gawk at our star, Mr Madden. So let's polish him up and make him shine for us in our hour of need. Our budgets are down. I'd like to get it up. All right. Very good. No. You don't get away that easily. Head of news and no idea what news I'm head of. Fine. When I tell you this, in normal circumstances, it would have you re-arranging the paperclips on my desk. But try, please. Just try to receive this news with a sense of composure and calm. And trust that good sense and the law will prevail and please do not do what you normally do. KNOCK AT DOOR Where have you been? Buying pornography. And you? Picking up fascists. Oh, marvellous. Apparently, she did photographs... Artistic ones. I thought maybe if I found them, then... What? What did you think? I don't know. I don't know what I thought. I thought they might lead us to whoever did this. Perhaps I thought, that if I could find the girl in these photos, if I could show them to the police, then they would see that she was lying. But all I can see are the men who buy these photos and the men who make money from these photos. And worse, I thought about Hector. What if he did do it, Freddie? What if we don't know him at all? We just have to hope we do. And what's that bloody fascist doing here? No. Just go with me on this, please. Ah, almost a full house. Shall we take stock in my office? The young gentleman I just saw going down with Mr Wengrove. He's a young fascist. The other gentlemen is Miss Cooper's young man, I understand? He is a doctor. Mr Lyon is going to interview them both. And they both agreed? Are you aware the board members will be here any minute? Yes. Yes we are. Your other chap, Mr...erm? Drayton. Fascists don't normally play very well. He's a kid... Fascist. ..with grievances. You are aware of BBC policy regarding the broadcast of fascist views? Sub policy. Freddie. It's an unwritten rule, it's not a policy and therefore... There might be better days to test-run this as an idea. Sundays are good. We don't work Sundays. You're getting my drift. What better way to see if we can do it than to show the board first? Board's here. Mr Brown is saying no to freedom of speech on The Hour. How passe. Fine. But just because I'm curious. And Mr Madden should be...? On his way. Don't kid a kidder, kid. Marnie... Where have you been? I had a meeting with Name That Dinner Guest. I'm sorry? It's a new programme. The doorbell rings and each week there's a different guest. As hostess, I cook for them and you have to guess who it is from what we're going to eat. I got it. But it's all right. I'm here now and I expect you'll want to interview me. This is where we will be doing the tele-recording. Yes... No Mr Madden today? It seems not. Would you care to take a seat, gentlemen? Hector was late... I'd made him coq au vin. But he didn't come home... So I went to bed. We are fortunate today to have two sides of a very potent debate on immigration. Er, Mr Lyon and Mr Wengrow will be tele-recording one of the key pieces that we may show on Friday's programme. I heard the door go and... It was dark outside. His feet were cold. I was angry at him. I didn't say but... no-one likes to be woken in the middle of the night. Cold feet rubbing with mine... ..but he was home. He was definitely home. I do so hate it when it's icy and he drives. I'd like to begin by introducing Dr Sey Ola. Hey, Mr Lyon, I'm not sure this is a good idea. All you have to do is talk of your experiences. This isn't a debate... He attacked your wife this morning! She more than anyone would like to hear why. You want to give him the opportunity to rally more boys to do the same? Mr Lyon... Who's this? Erm, Mr Trevor Drayton, Lord Reeves. He's a member of the British Defence Union. A fascist?! You're giving airtime to a fascist? Essentially, yes. I'm sorry, but no, I won't. Sey... Excuse me. I'm sorry, they didn't tell me. DOOR BANGS FOOTSTEPS APPROACH Liar! Sign her out. Stupid tart! What did you say? Sorry, Sir. Let's go with Mr Drayton. And try to keep the board members out of his eye line. Mr Brown, forgive me, but a number of us fought in the war and to watch you effectively trade the views of Dr Ola for this...young man, this fascist, quite honestly, our viewers will struggle to stomach it. Would you rather we ignore these views? Ring up Uncovered this week. Ask them what they're running. I promise you there won't be a single story that grabs you in the way that this one will. The Hour is prized for breaking ground. What could be more innovative than being the first to witness the face of inter-racial Britain, good or bad? I want this to feel as natural as possible. Just me and him. Like it's a conversation you're lucky to be earwigging. As we have no Mr Madden, think of this as an opportunity to say yay or nay to this obviously controversial item. And roll cameras! CHURCH BELLS TOLL No, it's all right. I'll drive. Mr Madden! Mr Madden! Would you mind? For my wife? Of course. There you are. Marnie... I don't want to know whether you did it or not. It doesn't matter. You know I...I wouldn't. No, I don't. And what kind of husband does that make you, when your own wife doubts you? Even when you're not lying for once. We won't talk about this again... ..but you need to know that while our marriage may be intact on paper... ..it's over for me, Hector. We will smile and be the perfect man and wife, but from now on, what you do with your time is of no interest to me and what I do is nothing to do with you. I will do what I like. Miss Rowley came and fought for you today, no doubt. It's ridiculous. Two sane, beautiful women wasted on you. Aren't you ashamed - the way you have us all fawning at your feet? I presume you want to go back to the office? I imagine your friends will be very relieved to hear of your lucky escape. We're not fascists. We're nationalists. We've let in 90,000 immigrants from alien races in the last five years. West Indians, Africans, Asians in our midst. They take our jobs, they move into our houses, they have inter-racial relationships... It is a bastardisation of our country by an unchecked immigrant community. And so you attack them? These people have come here in search of a better life, they've come here in search of employment... Yeah, yeah. Employment that we should be helping them find at home. Can we have the first slide, please, Isaac? This young woman. Where do you think she's from? Somewhere in Africa? Actually, Forest Hill. HE SCOFFS And this young woman, where do you think she's from? She's a Londoner, but her grandfather was Russian and fled the pogroms. Where would you like to see this young woman repatriated to? And this man. He's one of 300 men who served with the RAF during the Second World War. All of these people believe in democracy and some of them, as you can see, have even fought for the country that they now consider to be their home. Did you fight for your country? No, no, I didn't think so. No, Dr Ola did bring his skills as a doctor to Great Britain. This man has more than proved himself worthy of our support and so I would like to ask him... if he is disappointed with the views expressed by this young man? Yes. But then it also... it also reminds me... ..why I wanted to come to this country in the first place. This interview affirms for me the strength of the British democracy. And when someone is angry, someone does not always appreciate that. As a country, Britain has always thrived on open discussion and debate. That...that this young man can say this sort of thing and that he's free to say it, it marks for me the power of the British democratic system. That...that...that it is strong enough to face this fever, to fight this rancid, toxic, racist disease and to come out of it so strong. That is the country where I want to live. That is where my home is. Turn and record, finished. Thank you, gentlemen. BELL RINGS Ah, Mr Madden! Sey Ola, that was remarkable, thank you very much. Er...Lord Reeves, Mr Hector Madden. We didn't think you were coming. Excuse me. Mr Madden always pulls it out of the bag at the eleventh hour. That was brilliant, Freddie. Well done. But we have to talk about tomorrow... I used to know a boy like you. Filled with hate. It just became so damned exhausting. Not bad. You might just have won them over. Isaac, will you see Trevor out, please? Mr Pike paid me. What? Mr Pike paid me. To dump soot on your wife. I'm sorry? He's got his eye on your house. And you don't say no to Mr Pike. That's me done for. I'd bump up the Chameleon Club. Really? You are deliberately perverse, Mr Brown. NATO summit is the story. And it will still be there tomorrow. Fascists on the BBC. Now that is news. Is this what we have to look forward to? Continuous controversy? Watch Uncovered poach the story and run with it next week. You know their producer rang me and asked me out for dinner? Bill Kendall? Hmm, he was in earlier. Was he? I used to know his wife. Picture editor. She was...such a pretty girl. Was? She died. About a year ago. She left a little girl, I seem to remember. Funny little thing. Terribly sad. Straight home to bed tonight, eh, Hector? (Thank you.) I presume today won't rebound on us, Mr Madden? No, Mr Brown. The clock is ticking on you. It really is. Don't work too late. Always. Old enough to be her father. Yes. Why did you do that? Why not? Got your attention, though, didn't I? Swear to me that you will never do that to me again. And I am sorry. Aren't I always kind to you? Aren't I always nice to you? I hate it. I hate the way that you live. It's acting! No, it's not. It's acting of sorts. It costs if you want me just to be yours. Beats cigarette cards. It's not funny. Well, no-one makes them do it. What? They look like they're having fun? They get paid. Oh, I doubt for every copy. Fifteen bob for six photographs? God, you don't even care, do you? This girl, this sad, stupid, ambitious girl got beaten up. If it wasn't you, then who was it? Hector? Really? You...you don't want to know? Yes. Then ask yourself, if Miss Delaine was posing for these photographs, then why? What for? Is that all she is? Is that all any of us are to you? No. You've got brains as well. Sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I... I came to say thank you for today and, er... I'm sorry I'm so disappointing. No, just get out. I don't want to see your face this evening. PHONE RINGS Right. Right. Go to El Paradis tomorrow. Try and see if any of these girls work there? Maybe they'll talk. Who took these photographs? Who distributes them? Someone must be in charge. Why do these girls accept so little? And what did she do...to get beaten like that? Maybe just... that. Actually, there's a touch of Brando about him. Mr Cilenti. I'd better get back to Camille. She threw a cup at me. How's her aim? Good. She'll forgive me. Why? Because when she stops being angry, she'll love me for it. That's just... the way things are with us. Good night. I wish you'd told me... ..before you did such a stupid... ..st...stupid... ..wonderful thing. And what would you have done? Those are unsubstantiated figures. Those are...those are unsubstantiated... We would like to show you some photographs... We'd like to show you some photographs, Mr Drayton... Those figures are unsubstantiated... We'd like to show you some photographs... We'd like to show you some photographs. HE SIGHS DEEPLY DOOR OPENS Oh, I didn't see you there, Mr Madden. That's all right, Miss...? Peters. I'm new. On loan from the typing pool. Want a light on? No, thank you, Miss Peters. So much more fun in the dark. I was just... ..leaving for the night anyway. SMOOTH MUSIC PLAYS Commander, nice to see you tonight. It's very difficult. These "crimes de passion". I know you're a very passionate man. You care. Too much. Now, these are only photographs. You get to touch the real thing. I want her looked after. Never underestimate how much I know about your business practices. I could close you down tonight. Are you trying to blackmail me... when it is you asking me to look after your whore? Always welcome here, Commander. But everyone has to pay for their drinks. Even you. You're like woodworm working your way through the legs of my chair. Dare you sit? Please don't tell me you've been here all afternoon. Then I was in search of Mr Madden. And now? Chips? Take them. They're burning my hand. TV COMMENTATOR CHATTERS REEL CLICKS TV COMMENTATOR: '..waiting to make history. 'For Britain's first hydrogen bomb is about to be exploded. 'From this day, Britain will rank beside America and Russia 'as a major nuclear power.' "I saw the best minds of my generation "destroyed by madness. "Starving, hysterical, naked. "Dragging themselves through the Negro streets at dawn, "looking for an angry fix..." THEY CHAT QUIETLY Mr Madden, welcome back. Give me a front table, I've nothing to hide. Whisky, please. Double. ♪ Touch my lips ♪ So tenderly ♪ Softly, softly ♪ Turn the key ♪ And open up my heart... ♪ I'm trying to find out more about the man you work for. The testimony of a showgirl. Always bona fide. Miss Delaine's missing. Mr Cilenti is a businessman, so don't let your imaginations carry you away. I have earned this, Hector. Don't you dare spoil this for me. I have lied to you. I do NOT want to talk... I do! You're still looking into Miss Delaine? Best left to the police. Best for whom? You remain a first-rate journalist... and you must decide what is best for you. I read the police report. You sold me down the river. Well, thank you. For that act of self-sabotage. I believe that journalists who share their contacts are ultimately rewarded. I heard there was a scene. Oh, no, no, nothing like that. It was enough. Subtitles by Red Bee Media Ltd
