 Where is she? I'm dying to learn about my family tree. We might actually find out about the mysterious Aunt Sadie and why she gave all that money to your grandma. Chevon said she'll be here soon. She needed to swing by the poster store. Apparently, she went all-out on this. Does Chevon know she won't be graded? You know that doesn't matter to her. Hey. Your shirt. -What? Let's watch it. -Sounds good to me. Wait. What if it's, I don't know...

 Something embarrassing? Yeah. Do you have anything to be embarrassed about? No. Of course not. Problem solved. Raine. Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou! Looks boring. He's just practicing his lines for the play. Keep watching. Maybe something bigger. Yeah. Something the audience will never forget. You're right. It's boring. Let's just go. We're not going anywhere. Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou! I would my valiant master destroy thee. Mom! Please don't sneak up on me like that when I'm rehearsing. I take acting incredibly seriously.

 Okay. Dinner's ready. Thanks. "Mom." It was more like... "Mom!" I thought you said you didn't have anything to be embarrassed about. Don't make fun. Ruben takes his acting incredibly seriously. Finally. We can change the subject now. Ruben, can I borrow an easel? Okay. Ruben and I knew Grandma as Teressa Reyna, but her maiden name was Vargas. She had six sisters and one brother. We're getting somewhere. "Christina, Julianna, Camila, Elena, Ida, Maria and Roberto." But there's no Sadie. Exactly. So, I looked into Roberto. There was no name listed for his wife, but I did some digging. So, now we're getting somewhere. His wife was named Octavia. Not Sadie? Unfortunately, no. You know, next time you should just start with, "I hit a dead end." You didn't have to do this much work. I always do this much work. Okay. So, Grandma told Grandpa that she inherited a bunch of money from a great aunt she never met on her mother's side. And that aunt doesn't exist? It doesn't make sense. Heads up. It's G.W. "Would you believe..." Honestly, I don't know what to believe anymore. Would you believe... Would you believe... Would you believe... Saying "would you believe" over and over is not gonna make it any clearer. So, what do people believe in? A cause? Religion? A sports team? Donna? Hello. Excuse me. Hey. -Hey, Alison. What's wrong? I think it needs... I think Alison hates me. -So? It's like whatever I do I just end up making her angry. You have to stop caring what the Alisons of the world think of you. Well, she is the head costumer. I'm sorry, okay? I don't like her. You can do so much better. What was that about? Is Raine mad at me too? Don't worry about it. She did the same thing with Fee. I think it's because in the book all those girls were mean to her. I'm sure Alison's not really mad at you. So, I have some big news. Tell us. -We love big news. My dad told me he's taking me to Paris Fashion Week next year. - Alison, that's amazing! - I know. I can't believe it. Hey. Do you think he would take us too? You never know. I can ask. Awesome, Alison. That's super cool. You totally deserve it. Oh, and great outfit. Thanks. You get what you pay for. So, I was thinking of showing these outfits. That is so pretty. -I know. The sequins. Okay. Maybe she's just a little mad at you. She just wants to see... All right. So, where do we go from here? Okay. So, G.W. told us to follow the money. But we still don't know where it came from or how she paid for the bookstore. And then G.W. wrote on the window, "would you believe." What does that mean? Would you believe... Would you believe it was the stillest night in the history of nights? Would you believe nothing moved? Not a leaf, not a shadow and certainly not a man without bones. From acclaimed director J.J. Johnson comes a gripping adaptation of Mason Briggs' classic novel, A Man Without Bones. This fall, you better believe it. Terrific. Some other fans of Mason Briggs, I see. After 50 years, they're finally making a movie out of his best book. Never heard of him. One of the great masters of 20th century detective fiction. Started each book with the phrase, "Would you believe..." Where can we find these books by Mason Briggs? Upstairs in detective fiction, right next to the travel section. Because you love to read a good mystery when you're on vacation? Exactly. Mason Briggs wrote a lot of books. And they look good. Was G.W. expecting you to read all of these books? Because unless you plan on dropping out of school, it's gonna take a long time. Yeah, but how do we know which ones to start with? How about the one with the sparkle on it? "A Man Without Bones." That's my cue. Would you believe... it's a creepy office. Can you zoom in on the letter? -On it. That's Grandma's letter. From S. So that person is S. But who is it? Zoom in on the vase on the desk. Maybe we can see a reflection. Come on. No! We were so close. At least we found S. So, if that book was on S's desk, then how'd it get here? S must have given it to Grandma. Good thinking. I'll ask Grandpa. Hey, Grandpa. These books are awesome. Especially the first edition of A Man Without Bones. Where'd you get it? I think Grandma got it at an auction. It wasn't, like, a gift from somebody? Pretty sure it was an auction. Pretty sure it wasn't. Cool. Looks like Grandma lied about that too. Come on. Alison's not that bad. How can you say that? She's so full of herself. And she's not nice to you, and her little minions are just as bad. They're just joking around. So that gives them the right to be mean? No. I guess not. Look. It was hard enough to get on the costume team in the first place. I don't wanna make any trouble. But if you don't make trouble, then Alison will keep being a bully. Looks like Chevon wants to meet you before school. In the cafeteria. I'm sorry, Raine. I know it's a weird situation, but I don't know what you want me to do. I want you to stand up to Alison. Somebody has to. It's not as easy as it looks. Donna, you need to feed Rocco. Sorry, Dad. Be right there. Be right back. Donna, can I borrow your phone? I wanna text Chevon back. Sure. Go ahead. It's locked. Good morning. Thanks for meeting me. So, what's up? Curtis and I are working together on this English assignment. I knew he was trying to get his grade up to get back on the basketball team. But then when he gave me his half of the paper, it was filled with spelling mistakes and bad punctuation. And here's the thing, he kept saying how hard he worked on it. So, where do I fit in? I know he's my friend and I know it's invading his privacy, but I need to know. I'm trying to help him. Are you sure? Okay. Let's do this. You've been working on that forever. Aren't you done yet? Oh, yeah, almost. I'm gonna look over it one more time to make sure it's perfect. Just hurry up so we can leave. The season premiere of Paris Runway is on and I don't wanna miss it. But it's not perfect at all. There are run-on sentences and half of the words are misspelled. It's a mess. Then what's going on? It's like he's not lying, but he's not slacking off either. It must be something else. How's the book? Makes me wish I was a detective in the 1950s. No cell phone, no internet? Not me. Yes, but they did have typewriters. Look. So? So, remember when G.W. wrote "Help me" on the typewriter in the bookstore? Feels like such a long time ago. Maybe it's the same typewriter that S used to write the letter. Typewriters were like laptops then. Everyone had one. It's worth a shot. Let's meet up at the bookstore after school to check out the typewriter. Why are we here? We're supposed to meet the others at the bookstore. Just be patient. This won't take long. But trust me, it'll be so worth it. This is so exciting. How do I look? Great. It's the last person I want to run into. Hey, Heather. Oh, hi, Alison. Okay, so here's the collection. Everything works together. Like if you start with the pants you can dress them up with the tunic or dress them down with the sweater tee. Sorry, Alison, but what are these? My collection. Yeah, for the display window. Oh, well, hey, I think it's so great that you're starting to make your own stuff and some of these are totally cool, but the display window is... it's for professionals. I'm sorry. I can write you a recommendation. Epic fail. What is she gonna tell her little costume friends now? But you sent me all these texts. I was up all night working on these. Wow, that is so mean. What? -Alison, this isn't my number. Someone's been pranking you. I can't believe this. I'm really sorry I wasted your time. I never would have... No, don't worry about it. Who would do something like that? Wait, here. What are you doing? Really? We need to find out who did this to you. Gimme your phone, now. What? Why? It's an emergency. -What kind of... You did this? With my phone? This is what you borrowed it for? Donna? Alison, hi. No way. - I can't believe you would do this. - I didn't. I mean, well, I guess I did, but I'm really sorry. It was just a joke. I never meant... That is not how a costumer behaves. Where is everybody? They're late. How long were we supposed to stand here waiting? Might as well talk about something else. What else has been going on? Not much. You? Nothing. I'll just text them. -Yeah. I don't get it. Why would you do this? I watched your sparkles and I saw the way that Alison kept insulting you and it made me so mad. She needs to know what it feels like to be bullied. So, you used my phone and pretended to be the lady from the store? I thought getting her back would make you feel better. I don't feel better. Do you? No, I don't. We need to find Alison. No, we need to find the sparkle at the bookstore. This is more important. We have to make it up to her. For real. Where are they? I need to get to play rehearsal. Let's just look at it ourselves. I don't know. You heard Raine. She said she was the only one that could touch the sparkles. Yeah, but we've watched her do it a bunch of times now. You just have to look at it and concentrate. You know... Wow. That's exactly how she looks. You're a pretty good actor, but no way, I'm not doing it. If you're afraid, I totally understand. No problem. Fine, I'm in. -Great. You ready? Whoa, we did it. Hey, that's Grandpa. Cool hair, Grandpa. Okay, so, it looks like we're in the bookstore back when they had weird wallpaper. So, what should we look for? Oh, look at the sign in the back. I think it says "grand opening." So, this must've been right after Grandma got all that money to buy the bookstore. Guess so. All right, listen up. I think Grandpa's about to talk. Excuse me. I just wanna thank everyone for coming today. And I must give extra special thanks to my wife, Tess, who made this all possible. She's the most beautiful, brilliant and generally far-out woman I've ever met. Baby, you are so groovy. No, you're groovy. Wow, they're so... - "Groovy"? - I was gonna say cheesy. - It was a different time. May your spirit spread some very good vibes over this bookstore for many years to come. So, that's it? All right. I don't think I can listen to that speech again. Let's get outta here. ...everyone for coming today. What's going on? I think we're stuck in here. No, we just need to concentrate. I am concentrating. -Me too. Try harder. Are you concentrating? -Yes! Okay, okay. How are we gonna get out of here? I don't know, but we need to figure it out soon. If I miss rehearsal, I'm in big trouble. ...you are so groovy. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got... This is not good. Hello? She's the most beautiful, brilliant and generally far-out woman I've ever met. Baby, you are so groovy. No, you're groovy. Love that part. Dude, come on. Stop messing around. We have to get out of the sparkle. Don't yell at me. You said we should do it in the first place. Whatever. Let's at least try to find a clue if we're trapped here. Fine. What's up with this guy in the front. He's, like, the only one wearing a suit. I saw him talking to Grandma just before Grandpa gave his speech. What's going on? This is a new acting technique Ruben's been working on. It's kinda like meditation. Curtis is trying it out too for... support. Well, they certainly seem good at it. Where is Raine? All I ever wanted to do was impress you, but you were being so mean to me all the time and it made me wanna get back at you. But then, when I saw you there with that lady at the store, and I saw how embarrassed you were, I knew it was a big mistake. I'm really sorry. Wow, that was really nice. I accept your apology. And honestly, I shouldn't have been so mean to you in the first place. You're really talented. Like, seriously. I guess I was a little jealous. Maybe we can put this all behind us and just work on these costumes? This apology thing really works. Yeah, sure. See ya tomorrow. -Yeah. Donna, where's Raine? Curtis and Ruben are stuck in a sparkle. What? I told them not to do that. Well, they didn't listen. See? But Ruben needs to be here. Rehearsal's starting soon. What do we do? I don't know. This has never happened before. I might have an idea, but you're not gonna like it. What if... What if Raine goes home? Really? Do you think that would work? Maybe if you return to your world, you'll take the sparkles with you and Ruben and Curtis can snap out of it. It's worth a shot. But you better hurry. Seriously. This is where you first appeared, right? Yeah, around here. Why? There must be a sparkle here somewhere with your memory of that moment. Maybe if you watch it, it'll take you back to your world. I don't see any sparkles. But it doesn't make sense. Where is it? - I don't know what you're talking about. - The sparkle. You took it. I don't wanna watch it. You have to face this, Raine. Just like I faced Alison. I was at my old school and these girls were calling me names and laughing at me and making fun of me. But if I go back... Then you'll have to face your bullies. The right way. I know you're scared. But you still have to do it. Bye. Come on. Come on. All right. I think if we really zoom in on the guy, we can hear what he's saying to Grandma. Great. All set. Here comes the kiss. And go. I understand. So, we're agreed. If you take this money, you can never tell anyone who gave it to you. Including your husband. That's the book. A Man Without Bones. - Whoa. A check? - But why is he giving her a copy of it? Yeah. I mean, they're already in a bookstore. Rainey, I can't stop stealing. I love stealing. I can't help... Gotta read that check. Yes. If we can see the signature, we'll know if that guy is S. Come on. -Almost. Kleptoraineia. Kleptoraineia. Kleptoraineia. What does it say? No. -No. What happened to the sparkle? We need to get back. It's too late. -What about the signature? - What are you talking about? - A weird guy gave a check to Grandma and it was inside the Mason Briggs book. And get this, he told Grandma she wasn't allowed to tell anyone where she got the money. Even her husband. Poor Grandpa. He has no idea about any of this. And it should stay that way. No, we need to tell him. It's the only way to get to the truth.
