 Previously on Ghostwriter... It's a mystery. I love mysteries! - The book is blank. - I don't get it. Maybe we need to find a way to put them back in. I guess since moving here, it's been kinda hard. "Hello." What if your grandma's Ghost Writer? "Help me"? ﻿1 "Help me"? Help you with what? Grandma? Are you still there?

 Yeah, we're gonna need a little more to go on. Hello? Guess that's all we're getting. I've read a lot of ghost stories, and they only hang around when they have unfinished business. If your grandma's the ghost, then you must know what it is. She never seemed to have problems at Christmas, which was the only time I saw her. Chevon? I wish I knew, but she always seemed happy to me. If anyone sees anything, text the others. I started a group chain. Wait. Did someone just text a ghost emoji? That was me.

 Whatever. I guess I'll see you all tomorrow. - Bye, Ruben. - Bye. - See you, Ruben. - Later. {\an8}You had no right. It had been in this bookstore longer than you've been alive. Exactly! - Morning. - Morning. Can you believe your mother got rid of the antique cash register for this? I didn't realize you were so attached to it. It was huge. It took up half the counter. {\an8}It had charm. And at least it actually held cash. {\an8}Nobody uses cash anymore. {\an8}I'm sorry, okay? I'm just trying to help. She'll replace me next. Has anyone seen Spinoza? What's a Spinoza? The cat that lives in the alley behind the bookstore. I went to feed her, but she's not around. And you named her Spinoza? "Fear cannot be without hope. Nor hope without fear." Nothing? Baruch Spinoza, rationalist philosopher? The great freethinker of the 17th century. Yeah. I don't think they teach that in middle school, but they do care if you're late. Have a good day, sweetie. Maybe it's not so bad the smelly cat's gone. Says you. He took my bagel. How'd you kids sleep? Great. Love the new bunk beds. Feels like we're on a cruise ship. Donna snores. I know this place isn't as big as your mom's, but Donna's gonna help me fix it up. Oh, yeah. I have lots of ideas. What do you think of an orange accent wall? That's... bold. Exactly. It'll totally brighten up the place. I'm not living in an orange apartment. We can come up with a color we all like. Did you take Rocco for a walk? Sorry, Dad. I was in a rush this morning. Curtis took too long in the bathroom. Hey, hair like this doesn't just happen. I'm gonna try to take off work for the game this week. I'm not playing this week. What? It's on the schedule. I pulled a muscle, and Coach doesn't want me to risk it. Well, you better put some ice on that, and take it easy. - Will do. - Come on, Rocco. Time for a walk. Let me put the milk away. Gotta be careful with your shoulder. Okay. Now, tomorrow, we'll discuss the queens of Egypt. Read the chapter, please. Okay, Mr. Slithers, let's hope Saunders is in a good mood. Hey, Mr. Saunders. Hey, Curtis. What's up? I only have a second. Actually, I was hoping we could talk, you know, sports guy to sports guy. I can see you played some ball in your day. Yeah, I was a shortstop all the way through college. So, you know how important it is not to let down your teammates. Yeah. And I can't play until I get my grade up. Yeah, it's a tough break. But it's school policy. There's nothing I can do. Actually, maybe there is. I was wondering if you could let me take the test again. I can't give special treatment to athletes. It wouldn't be fair to the other students. Sorry. You could have warned me. I don't think I'll make a very good ghost. Unfinished business sounds way too stressful. I'd be an awesome ghost. I never finish anything. It took you long enough. It's freezing out here. I had to talk to Saunders. What's... up? Looks like our ghost is back. "This way." Which way? I think we're going to find out. Heads up. This is classic ghost behavior. Grandma brought us here? What is this building? And why is there a jungle in it? Why would Grandma lead us here? No idea, but... is that normal? Nope. Do you have anything to eat? You all heard that, right? Yeah. No. Sorry. Don't come any closer. Hey, he's just a pigeon. A talking pigeon. Do you know what diseases they carry? Hey. I'm an honest pigeon just looking for a bite to eat. Maybe some of that popcorn people drop on the ground? I don't carry popcorn around. Though I should. Well, thanks for nothin'. - You speak to the animals too? - No. Well, technically, we did speak to a rabbit yesterday. Okay. So there was that one time. Wait. A boy who can climb trees and talk to animals. I hope it is who I think it is. And that is? Are you Mowgli? From The Jungle Book. You know who I am? Yeah. I know all about you. You were born in the jungle. You were raised by wolves. So cool, by the way. But how can you know all this? The tales of your bravery have crossed the seas far and wide. You must be freezing. Here. Here. Like this. I don't get it. Why'd the ghost let him out? Hey. Forget the popcorn. Do any of you have a bag of bread crumbs? Bread crumbs! So, now Mowgli's here, we can hear animals talking. It has to be related. I might know. Grandpa said the bookstore cat is missing. Spinoza's missing? - You know her? - Yeah. Grandma loved that cat. I'm being hunted by a cat. A tiger named Shere Khan. He will stop at nothing until he has me in his clutches. But I have come from the jungle to this strange human village to take refuge. Don't worry. There's no tigers wandering around the city. I fear I do not understand this new world. We can help with that. And maybe you can help us find my grandpa's cat. Great. Let's start with pants. Does he know what's on city streets? Every animal leaves a scent and a track. We must follow it. No. We were right. This is definitely the ghost. What's he doing now? I've... never smelled anything like this. What is it? Hey! That's my 'za! Get your own! A rat... that talks. Hey, who you calling a rat? I'm a mouse. Not that you care, Miss Jump to Conclusions. The name's Gracie. Animals are actually talking to us. Sorry. Still not very used to it. Hey, Gracie, do you happen to know a cat named Spinoza? Give me back my pizza, and I'll tell you everything I know. Haven't seen her. And good riddance. I can finally eat in peace. Yeah, or so I thought. Mowgli, maybe we can ask some other animals in the neighborhood - if they've seen Spinoza. - I will send out the call. What was that one? - Elephant. - We don't have elephants here. Although, at this point, nothing would surprise me. I remember that day because there was a big cluster of acorns. - What does that have to do with Spinoza? - Who? Oh, yeah. I know Spinoza. She was always swatting at me. Where was the last place you saw her? I... saw... Yes? Her... Right there. Some animal took her away. What kind of animal? I'd rather not say. If Spinoza finds out, who knows what she'll do to me? Wearing... - Could it have been a human? - Could have been. Or a monkey on another monkey's shoulders. A... coat. It's winter! Everyone's wearing a coat. Spinoza will never find out it was you. Okay, fine. I'll talk. Whoever took your friend wore purple. So, whoever took Spinoza was the size of a monkey on a monkey's shoulders, in a purple coat. I'm hoping it's actual monkeys. How cool would that be? We have very different definitions of cool. We should pick this up tomorrow. I need to wash my hands and get a new coat. What's your deal with animals anyway? I don't like them, and they don't like me. Last month a dog nearly attacked me in front of the post office on Fifth. I have to take the long way home just to avoid him. Don't let one mean dog ruin it for all the others. They're the best. They're cute and cuddly and so loyal. Sure, they look cute until you let your guard down. Then... I'm hungry. I will go hunt now. Or come to our dad's place, and we can make you a sandwich. - Yes! Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - I'm never thinking what you're thinking. - Rocco. We could talk to him. - What's a Rocco? Only the cutest puppy in the world. You're gonna love him. And where is my dinner? I have grown tired of the cheap kibble. Do I not deserve the best? Yes? The vet said it's good for you, and it's grain-free. Please, the doctor is a fool. Why are you looking at me that way? I thought you would be... different. Yeah. I didn't think you'd be so "complainy" and have a French accent. My father, he is from Paris. What happened to my little doggy? Your little doggy? When's the last time you walked me? Or even threw the ball in my direction? What a strange little wolf. Right. Doggy. How dare you? I am purebred! Who is this stranger? This is Mowgli. What is that smell? He doesn't smell like any wolf cubs I know. If you must know, that's my anti-flea shampoo. Why don't you bite the fleas like a real wolf? Get him out of my sight at once. Rocco, you're being rude. Who asked you? I read the book last night. Mowgli's life was wild. It would be so cool to grow up with wolves. And be best friends with a bear and a panther. The human-eating tiger didn't sound so great. So, is he still at your dad's place? Yeah. Catching up on sleep. He spent the whole night keeping watch from higher ground. I didn't sleep either. I could feel Rocco glaring at me all night. But it did give me a chance to finish this. I made a journal filled with all our clues. - Why? - Because it's a lot to keep track of. Plus, when I'm older, I want proof this actually all happened. So, what are we gonna do about Mowgli? Should we figure out how to put him back in the book? Not until we find Spinoza and hear what she has to say. We should talk to more animals. Someone must have seen something. The Pharaoh Menes led Egypt into what we call the First Dynasty. And even though he was powerful enough to unite Upper and Lower Egypt into one nation, the pharaoh met his end after fighting a hippopotamus. - What are you doing? - Is this your pack's council? Get down. Get down! Sorry, Mr. Saunders. I just really feel bad for Menes. A hippopotamus? Man, that is just embarrassing. What are you doing here? I couldn't stay with the mean runt. He tried to get me to rub his belly. Rocco does love belly rubs. It's one of the snake people. You know, snakes like belly rubs too. Mr. Slithers, you're a Miss Slithers? It's Joan, actually. Mr. Slithers! A little on the nose, don't you think? I didn't name you. You're the one who tried to get Saunders to let you retake your test. Nice try, but I could have told you it wasn't gonna work. Well, if I knew I could ask you, I would have. How do I get Mr. Saunders to change his mind? Not so fast. It'll cost you. I have dealt with snakes before. Promise her many goats, and she'll talk. We don't have any goats. Maybe you could turn on my heat lamp. You have no idea how good that feels. What about Mr. Saunders? I'll tell you what you don't do, try and butter him up. All that talk about baseball. Bad move. Just be honest. No excuses. He has a heart. Just give him a chance to use it. Got it. Thanks, Joan. And tell that kid Jeff to stop tapping my glass all the time. What's up? Nothing. Just making flyers for Spinoza. I didn't realize she was so important to you. Well, she's not, but she's important to Grandpa. Well, let me help. Great. Thanks. But first... try it. Best shawarma in the city. I used to get one when I was in high school. I called it my post-dinner snack. Grandpa wasn't the best cook. So it runs in the family. Feel free to make your own dinner. - Not bad. - "Not bad"? This is perfection in a pita. That takes me back. It's so weird. I couldn't wait to get away from this place. I know how you feel. If I close my eyes, it feels like this whole thing has been a dream, and I'm still 15 years old and sneaking a late-night snack. And then I open my eyes, and I'm a grown-up, and I have a son. It's hard to imagine this place ever feeling like home to me. I know this has been a really big change for you, bud. But I think you're doing so well. You seem to be doing better. I'm really happy that you're hanging out with Chevon. Well, we're not exactly hanging out. Oh, yeah? Who's that? Okay. Maybe we're hanging out a little, but she really wants to find the cat too. Well, we should get these flyers up first thing in the morning. I am going to go to the store - before it gets too late. - Okay. I'm gonna pick your grandpa up at his card game. Is that a purple coat? Yeah. Wait. It was you! You took Spinoza! How did you know? It doesn't matter. It's true. I thought she was just a stray cat that hung around the store, so... I decided to take her to the shelter. Well, we have to find her. What shelter? Well, actually, we never made it. She jumped out of the cab on the way, and I tried to follow her, but she got away from me. I have to text Chevon. I'm so sorry. Let me help you find her. No! It's okay. I think you've done enough. What about when I took you to the dog park and let you run around with all the other dogs? I was not running with the dogs. I was running away from the dogs. Commoners, all of them. I'm sorry. I thought you liked it. You never have time for me anymore. You just leave me in this appartement with Father. But I don't have a choice. I have to go to Mom's three days a week. But why? Because Mom and Dad split up. Split up? I do not understand. What is this to do with me? I guess it's hard to explain. Especially to a dog. Have you seen Mowgli? What are you doing here? It's freezing. I don't like it inside. I can't see the stars. You must miss the jungle. Yes. Things were simpler there. It is true we had to constantly hunt for our own food. Shere Khan wanted to kill me. And you never knew when men would appear with spears. But... it was home. I know how you feel. This doesn't feel like home yet either. Yeah. At our old place, before our parents got divorced, we used to have separate rooms. And now we have two homes. I guess we must all make the best of our new situation. Rocco, I know that things are different now, but it has nothing to do with you. I wish I could see you every day, but... I guess we both just need to try to make the best of things. I miss when we were all together, especially movie night. You always shared your snacks with me. Yeah. Me too. From now on, I'm going to make more of an effort. Like daily walks. Even on the days where I'm at Mom's. Okay? I suppose. But no more dog park, okay? Deal. Your mom's confession helped narrow the search. But the real break was the horde of termites who heard from a bunch of ants that this shelter found a tuxedo cat. Why would the cat be here? If an animal doesn't have a home, they bring 'em here to the shelter. - When is dinnertime? - But why are they in cages? - Little dog here. - So they don't hurt anyone. It seems like they are the ones being hurt. Would you take me home? Please? This is no place for a wolf. Spinoza. Finally. I don't get it. Why can't she talk, like all the others? Where's Mowgli? What the... There goes my promotion. He's gone. And he took the dogs with him. - -Come with me! I'll keep you safe! -Please move... Let's go! - -Come with me! I'll keep you safe! -Please move... Let's go! - Let's go! - Wait for me.
