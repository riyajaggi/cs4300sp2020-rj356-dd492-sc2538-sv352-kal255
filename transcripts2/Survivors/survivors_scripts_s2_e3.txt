 Survivors (2008â€“2010): Season 2, Episode 3 - Episode #2.3 - full transcript 
 When the group's Land Rover breaks down they are helped out by wheeler-dealer Billy, who knows everyone - including Samantha, to whom he betrays their position.She has Tom put on trial for killing her man Gavin and it comes out that he was originally in prison for committing a double murder during a robbery. Samantha says she will release him if he kills Dexter, who is becoming a liability to her. He does so but she reneges, sending both him and Greg to become slave labour in coal mines owned by Smithson, a friend of the duplicitous Billy.

 To get the best results
we should reinfect her.
 Uh!
 Abby!
 I'll never be safe.
They'll never stop looking.
 Tom was a hero yesterday.
You have no idea what he did.
 Can you survive without this?
 Get this out of my sight!
 That man is a thug.
 Come on! Hard man, eh?
 - Hello, Abby.
- You get him away from me.
 You're coming back with us.
 - She's not going anywhere. - You can't
take her! She's not a prisoner!
 She's coming with us!
 Gavin? The guy's just
looking for trouble.
 Drop it! I dare you. I'm fine.
 The rules have changed now and the
sooner we all realise that...
 ...the better the chance we've got.
 We make our own law now.
 - Is she here?
- Yeah.
 Hey, everybody, she's here.
 Hello.
 Morning.
 Samantha Willis. Government
minister. The only one who didn't die.
 I'm here today to reassure you.
 We have established a base
and begun to restore authority,
 to bring back law and order.
 To safeguard a future, for ourselves
 and for the children.
 Yeah?
 And what do you want from us?
 Your allegiance.
 The more we are, the more organised
we'll be, the better we'll survive.
 And you'll tell us what to do,
and take what we grow?
 You want security. Pay tax, you get
protected. That's government.
 We don't want government.
I understand that.
 We don't need protection.
 Yes, you do.
 Get in the car.
 We have to convince them.
Yeah, but...
 It's simple. Make friends,
not enemies!
 Violence is unnecessary.
 Unless someone really does
go beyond the pale.
 Slow down!
 Yeah, and let the lab
catch up with us.
 Slow down.
 What are you, her enforcer?
 You're overheating.
 Aah!
 What's up?
 Fan belt.
 There's a house.
 Yeah, we need to get off this road.
 Come on. Let's get Abby out.
 Take it easy. I'm OK.
 Run out of gas?
 No.
 Hey, I'm Kev, nice to meet you. Al.
 Al. Najid. Naj.
 Good to meet you, mate.
Hey! Not an ambush, is it, lads?
 No.
 No? Phew. That's a relief.
 What you got in the back?
Whatever you want.
 You've got everything!
 It's amazing, innit? Yeah.
 Billy just picked me up yesterday.
I was like... ohhh!
 He's going to be my apprentice.
 Yeah, you know,
help him on the rounds and stuff.
 One fan belt.
 Hey, thank you.
 I carry a few Land Rover parts,
as it happens.
 Not just cos they're a popular post-virus
vehicle, but cos I like 'em personally.
 I want to see 'em survive.
 Let the Japs go the way of the dodo.
 Well, what can we give you?
 This one's on the house.
You don't look too clever, love.
 Here, find something for her.
Juice, vitamin C, have a look.
 What about you?
 Handgun. Please.
 Like he's asking for an ice cream!
 No, sorry, son. I don't do guns.
 Right, everybody sorted?
 Yeah, thanks.
 You coming with us? No? No.
 All right. Another time.
It doesn't work.
 You threw it wrong. Come on.
Uh-oh...
 Better scarper before they sue us.
 Oooh!
 All right, see you.
We can get going.
 We should hide here
for a couple of days.
 Let her rest.
 She can rest on the road.
 Can't argue, she's a doctor.
 Don't call me mate.
 OK. A day. Move on tomorrow.
 Woman runs this place.
 Politician.
 He's not a woman.
 Dex.
 Billy!
 Ten. Gallons?
 Litres. Bloody Europe.
 Every little bit helps.
 You got it?
 You star, man.
 Very nice.
 Right, good for some goodies, yeah?
 Keep 'em sweet.
 Smoke, yeah? Here you are.
There's a packet.
 What are you doing?
I'm making friends.
 You've all worked very hard.
 You deserve a few treats.
 Carry on, Dexter.
 Well done.
 Hello, Billy.
 How's my favourite girl?
 They give you any trouble,
you let me know.
 Thank you. I found them.
 Your man. The Manc.
 Tom Price. With the others?
 Yeah.
 Asian kid, black guy, few women.
 He's trouble. Let him go.
 Yeah, looks it.
 No, he's a criminal.
 He murdered Gavin...
 who was one of us.
Could have been you, or you,
 or you.
 We cannot accept that.
 No!
 Ssh! It's OK.
 It's OK.
 Why did they give Abby the virus?
 Well, they knew she'd caught it
before and survived it.
 They wanted to find out how her
body fought it. To develop a cure.
 Will they give it to us if they
catch us?
 No, we're immune.
 Probably just a mouse.
 Should've brought the shotgun.
 I'll protect you.
 Hey, these are edible.
You can eat them.
 I know what edible means.
 I didn't say you didn't.
 I don't fancy eating them.
 You don't trust me?
 More than you trust me.
 You get these in Poland.
 Used to pick them with my
grandfather.
 I'll fry them for you,
 little bit of oil... Delicious.
 Wrong type?
 Sometimes it's hard to tell.
 Don't risk it, then.
 One question.
 What's my favourite colour?
 What were you in prison for?
 Why can't you be honest with me?
 Well, now, that's two questions.
 What I did, I had to do,
 to survive.
 Go! Get on the floor. Get down!
 Anya, run!
 Never mind her.
 Hello.
 Ahhh...
 Who's got a noose?
 Be nice to hang you.
Wouldn't it, yeah?
 Here and now. Wouldn't it, huh?
 No, she wants to...
 "put you on trial".
 Come on.
 Hurry up. Get him in the car.
 Get in! Get in!
 Are you OK?
 Where's Tom? What's he done?
 Dexter. Here?
 They've taken him.
We have to go after them.
 How many? Four, five.
 With guns? Yeah.
 What's happened? Tom's gone.
 They've taken him to Samantha's
to put him on trial.
 To what? For killing Gavin.
 How did Samantha find us?
We have to help him. We have to go.
 Yes.
 We can't all go, we're not going to
fight them. We need to negotiate.
 You can't go, she hates you.
 You two stay here with Naj.
Anya, get what you need.
 I'm coming.
 Lost your ball?
 Don't get up. Seriously.
 Glad to have you back with us.
 Couple of blanks
I need you to fill in.
 Were you in prison when the virus
hit? Where's my solicitor?
 Dead, I imagine. You escaped...
I'd offer you a drink...
 What was your sentence?
But all I've got's a bucket of piss.
 I'm guessing life.
 What's this going to achieve?
 Justice must be done, must be seen
to be done, to maintain society.
 No power without punishment.
 That what gangland taught you?
 Move, move! Out.
 Hands on the vehicle.
 Abby. Where is he?
 Is he hurt? I need to see him.
He's fine, he's in custody.
 Custody?
 Tom has been arrested for the murder of
Gavin Wilson and goes on trial tomorrow.
 Will that be like the last trial?
 No. Our early days, Abby.
 But we've evolved since then
and can now deliver justice.
 Hmm! You don't think we can?
 So why don't you defend him?
 We'll have a jury of five.
 You two can be on it.
 Three against two?
 And when he's found guilty...
If...
 You kill him. He'll be
imprisoned humanely.
 So, Abby,
would you like to see your client?
 Could be worse.
 He could be dead already.
 Geoff? Greg.
 Greg, yeah, sorry.
 For shooting me?
 Yeah. Wasn't after you. My mistake.
 You'll never let him go.
 I will if he's acquitted. It's not
like you to give up, Abby. You can win.
 - Yeah!
- And I'll still have proved my point,
 that we're accountable,
the law's more powerful than the gun
 and this society is civilised
and can feel good about itself.
 And do you feel good about Dexter?
 What do you mean?
 Your enforcer.
 Are you going to prosecute him
for shooting Greg?
 Oh, you can't, can you?
Because without him you're powerless.
 You think so?
 Counsel for the defence.
 I'll leave you to it.
 You got anything for me?
Something I can cut with. Anything.
 You can't fight your way out.
There's two armed guards out there.
 They're nothing.
 You scare them.
That's what I'm saying.
 So, any excuse,
they'll shoot you dead.
 Look, Tom, we can do this.
 We'll get you acquitted,
we'll get you out of here.
 I've heard that one before.
 Maybe we can't win, but...
 but we have to try, because
right now there's no alternative.
 Yes, you killed Gavin...
 .. but it wasn't murder.
 You told me at the time you had no
choice.
 Don't look like that tomorrow.
 Like what?
Like you're a special case.
 Like you don't care
who lives or dies.
 You care,
 I know you care.
 Dad?
 Nice kip? Where are we?
 End of the road.
 What?
 No! Aagh!
 Hold him.
 Why... Why am I here?
 Are you going to kill me?
 Interesting guess.
 Quite wrong.
 Come on.
 Better fed than the last one.
 Diesel. Life's blood.
 Samantha wants to meet you.
 Miss Willis?
 Come and see me
when you've loaded your bounty.
 We'll arrange a rendezvous.
 Come in.
 What have you come as?
 Time I got smarter, more official.
 I feared there'd been a funeral.
 No.
 It's a good idea this trial,
people are looking forward to it.
 But I was thinking
I should go on the jury.
 Make sure he's convicted.
 Cos I'm thinking, if he's not,
 then it'll look like
the trial's been a waste of time...
 .. and resources.
 People might start to wonder
why we're in charge.
 Good.
 You're on it.
 Are you nervous?
 Yeah.
 Big day tomorrow.
 Let's hope you get a good jury.
 Seen this?
 Telescopic.
 Good, isn't it, huh?
 You'll have her eye out! Shut up.
 Our dad...
 loved me sister.
 You blinked.
 Sorry.
 Are you OK?
 Can't sleep.
 Are you worried about them?
 Are you still getting flashbacks?
 Of what happened?
 It's more that...
 I close my eyes and I see...
 What?
 What might happen.
 Morning.
 Morning. Morning.
 You hear them noises in the night?
 Noises?
 No, I didn't hear any noises. No.
 You know, these old houses...
 Maybe I imagined them.
 Yeah.
 How's Najid?
 He's fine.
 He's a lovely boy.
 You lost children?
 Yeah.
 I had two boys.
 At least they're safe now
from this dangerous world.
 What was Tom in prison for?
I don't know and don't care.
 You don't care?
 In the long run, it'll be better for
him to pay his debt, serve his time
 and then be genuinely free.
 Yes, yes, yes,
you're doing it for him, right.
 And for everyone else.
 Najid, Al, Anya...
 Ask yourself.
 Do you really want to build
your new family
 around such a deeply troubled
individual?
 Sorry. You've been waiting?
 I was just having a look
at the water system.
 This place is amazing.
 We need a plan for when he's
convicted.
 He may not get convicted.
 Is that what Samantha told you?
 Maybe you can convince them.
 They're already convinced. By her!
 Or by the facts.
 You seem in danger of forgetting
that in this amazing place...
 I'm not in danger of anything!.. She
had you shot! That was Dexter.
 Samantha made a mistake using...
A mistake?!
 You can't trust her!
All I'm saying is,
 it's not like it's going to turn out
it was someone else who did it.
 Tom shot Gavin. Tom is one of us.
 Whatever you say.
 Tom Price stands before us today
accused of the murder of Gavin Wilson.
 A murder described by
the sole eyewitness, Michael Rudd,
 as cold-blooded and unnecessary.
 So traumatised was he by this
execution, he left us soon afterwards
 to find, he said,
"Somewhere safer to hide...
 ".. from Tom Price. "
 So the only witness isn't here?
 You have his written statement.
 Yes, Tom shot Gavin.
 Gavin came into our home
and abducted Anya.
 He was armed with a shotgun... Which
Tom took from him. You saw that, Greg?
 Anya?
 And then he told you to leave.
 To spare your blushes, and his,
when he executed a defenceless man.
 He had no choice. No?
 He felt he had no choice.
 Gavin's standing there,
the abductor,
 having terrified Tom
with the prospect of losing Anya,
 the horror of what
he might do to her.
 Now the threat's passed.
But the blood is still pumping.
 But she was safe and he was
disarmed.
 I don't care.
I would've shot him too.
 No, you wouldn't.
 So, you were provoked
beyond endurance?
 And yet the witness states, "There was
no emotion when he pulled the trigger. "
 No emotion.
 You have no right to stand there and
pronounce judgment after what you did.
 Many of you missed the last trial...
And it's hardly relevant.
 ...where the defendant was found guilty
of theft. So Samantha shot her dead.
 Was that legal?
 So it's OK if a dictator does it?
 This court's a sham.
 It's a joke and so is she!
 Moral authority?
 If anyone should be on trial
for murder, she should be.
 Shame!
 You want anarchy? No leader? No law?
 I hold up my hand. Mea culpa.
 I was... too severe.
 Too desperate to protect
what we have here from invaders.
 Someone cried out, "Shame"?
 Yes, I feel shame.
 And guilt. Every day
for the sacrifice that I made.
 What about you, Tom?
 What do you feel?
 Nothing?
 Nothing now...
 and nothing when
he pulled the trigger.
 Clearly, unlike me, he had done it
before! Hadn't you?
 That is not relevant.
So what were you in prison for?
 Don't answer that. Rape?
 No.
 Past crimes don't count.
Of course they do. Murder?
 Who did you kill?
 We blagged a security van.
 Two guards clocked our faces.
 So I shot 'em both.
 Like I said...
 .. to survive.
 Pure distilled ruthlessness.
 100% proof.
 Now we know.
 Thank you, Tom.
 Finally, for your...
 Honesty.
 We've heard enough. Let's break.
 We'll reconvene at two
to hear your individual verdicts.
 Tom?
 You still think you can save me?
 Afternoon. Billy.
 How are you? All right.
 Mr Smithson, Samantha Willis.
 The Right Honourable.
 Hm. Nice car.
 Things... Yes...
 To console us in this world of woe.
 I hear your place is lovely.
 Mmm.
 Marred by the odd unruly element.
 Whom you could absorb?
 Hmm...
 Indeed.
 He's dangerous. But strong.
 Well, we can contain him.
 And payment?
 Oh, it's not necessary.
Free transfer.
 Aside from the usual agent's fee.
 Well, you're happy, I'm happy.
 Thanks. We'll deliver tomorrow.
 And you're not going to ask about
the conditions he'll be kept in?
 No.
 In the interests of transparency,
I will ask each juror in turn
 for his or her verdict.
 A majority of at least three-to-two
is required for a conviction.
 Jurors? Are you ready?
 Lincoln?
 Guilty.
 Anya?
 Not guilty.
 Helen?
 Not guilty.
 I beg your pardon?
 Not guilty.
 We're not trying him
for his previous crimes
 and in this case I agree with the
defence, sufficient provocation.
 Greg?
 Guilty.
 We didn't hear you right. Guilty.
 Well, there we are.
 We have a verdict. Guilty.
 You forgot me.
 Sorry.
 One more, Dexter?
 Not guilty.
 Which makes it three against two.
 Not guilty. So, you can let him go.
 Bloody hell. She's speechless.
For once!
 Maybe that's why she wanted this
trial.
 So she could talk.
 And why should we listen to her?
 Because she was a politician.
 A politician?
 Yeah, respect.
 They're not a bunch of
self-promoting wankers,
 addicted to power
and making speeches, are they?
 Your true talent,
a stand-up comedian.
 And yours is what? Executioner?
 At least that makes sense
in the new world.
 Unlike locking up murderers and having
to feed and guard them 24/7 for ever?
 She brings him here, a lethal
animal. To me, that's insane.
 That's why I voted not guilty.
 So you can get shot of him.
Let him go.
 No, that reason is not valid.
 Not valid?
 You acknowledge he's a murderer.
Therefore the verdict is guilty.
 And this court sentences him
to seven years!
 You said the jury would decide!
The jury's dismissed.
 And who'll guard him?
He won't be held here.
 I've made other arrangements. But
thank you, Dexter, for your concern.
 And thank you, everyone,
for your co-operation.
 Take the prisoner away.
 OK, forget what happened in there.
 How could you?! It wouldn't
have made any difference.
 It would've been 4-1,
she couldn't have overruled that!
 I'm not the villain here!
 I didn't shoot those guards.
 What about them?
What about their families?
 You're going to forgive him, because
you love hanging out with that murderer.
 Violence, good solution.
 You're learning.
Think what he's done for us!
 Yes, he's a real hero.
 Oh, you want to be the leader?
 Well, what's your solution?
 We go get Al and the others
and we head for the coast.
 And leave Tom?
 Well, what's your solution?
Stick around and visit him?
 Maybe you can rehabilitate him,
show him that executing witnesses
 makes sense in a way,
but it can be damaging emotionally.
 Like betraying people.
 I don't need this. I know.
 You're all blaming me...
I'm not blaming you.
 No, you're not blaming anyone.
Least of all Tom.
 Greg, I was just coming to find you.
 I felt awful about
not letting you have your say.
 How did you feel about
the verdict?
 Look... What were we trying to do
today? Deliver justice.
 No, no. You lost
and so you changed the rules.
 The man's guilty. You said it.
 So did I. In the end,
the rules, the game, doesn't matter.
 What matters is the truth.
We see that. They don't.
 Now, personal loyalties are
important,
 but maybe this is
the fork in the road for you, Greg.
 Now, I'd love you to stay.
 I'll be taking full control shortly.
 Might kick off with a public
hanging.
 Visitor.
 I searched her.
 Every orifice.
 Two minutes.
 Are you OK?
 Can I get you anything? Food or...
 He just checked my pockets
and shoes.
 I don't care.
 What?
 I don't care.
 OK.
 That took courage...
 .. to admit...
 what you did to everyone.
 To me.
 Thank you.
 Stay close with Abby and Greg.
 Don't trust anyone.
We're not going to abandon you.
 We'll find a way, we'll get you
out... No, you're not.
 You're going to get as far away
from here as possible and from me.
 Don't tell me what to do.
I'm telling you for your own good.
 I don't want to be thinking of you
getting... Just... just do what I say.
 I can look after myself.
 Good.
 I wish that...
 What?
 What?
 Time's up.
 You were right about Samantha.
 And you were right about Tom.
 I was wrong. It hit me today
in the court.
 I'd been clinging on to the idea
that he had to kill Gavin.
 Denying his criminal background.
 Refusing, like you say,
to blame him...
 .. to admit his guilt...
 .. because I needed him
 to fit my idea of good.
 But I don't need that any more.
 I admit his guilt.
 I accept it.
 I accept him.
 As he is. Now.
 One of us.
 One of us.
 All set? Your mind made up?
 Yep.
 Get the others, head for the coast.
 If you have second thoughts,
you're welcome here.
 Al?
 It's the Land Rover.
They're back. Hm?
 OK.
 Al...
 Let's keep it a secret.
 Yes.
 No Tom?
 No. Er...
 we've exhausted
all the legal avenues. So...
 We're going to bust him out!
 How are you?
 Let's make a deal. You do something
for me, I'll let you go.
 Kill Dexter.
 Why don't you do it yourself?
 Wouldn't look good.
 When you meet your maker?
 When I meet my public.
 I'll put out a story you escaped and
Dexter was killed trying to stop you.
 You're good.
 No.
 He's killed.
 He's raped. There was talk about
a young girl...
 Sounds like he deserves to die,
then. OK, I'll do it.
 For society.
 Do you think Anya will wait for you
for seven years?
 You think she'll be safe out there
without you?
 Do it for yourself.
 His life for your freedom,
you've done it before.
 There are other men in the room
where he sleeps.
 But he goes out to exercise early
every day, alone. You can do it then.
 I'll be back at dawn.
 Good luck.
I could come and help, you know.
 Er, great, except...
 that'll leave Sarah on her own.
 No, someone's got to stay with me.
Could you do that?
 OK. Be ready to leave. Fast.
 This way.
 Do your own feet.
 The outdoor gym,
by the amphitheatre.
 When you're done, don't come for me,
or I'll shoot you myself.
 This is why you brought me here.
 Have a nice life.
 Watch it, they could be armed.
 Stop! Stop!
 Let's go.
 Get out the car now!
 What was that all about?
 They've moved him already.
 I'll check the outbuildings.
 She let me out. To kill you.
 She your boss now, is she?
You'd better do what she says.
 Bosses, man.
Make us do their dirty work.
 Fight each other, while she's still
in charge? It's wrong.
 Stop talking. Now come on.
 This isn't about her,
this is about you and me.
 You think you're it, don't you?
Guess what?
 You're not it.
 I am.
 All right, enough...
 Listen, listen.
 You and me, man, we're the same.
 Together we can rule. Yeah?
 Here first.
 Then the whole country.
What do you say, huh?
 We can take whatever we want.
 Tempting.
 Stay where you are!
 Don't move! Don't move!
 Oh, my God, you killed him!
 Let him go!
 OK. Fine.
 You know what, Greg?
 It isn't worth it. You want Tom?
 You can have him. Just...
 put the gun down.
 Let's make a deal.
 Just put the gun down.
 When I said put it down,
I meant drop it.
 Take them both.
 They've got Greg!
 They've got Greg.
 They've taken them both.
 No, no!
 Come on.
 Where are they?
 Gone, I'm afraid. Gone where?
 Your innocent Tom killed Dexter.
 Well, he must have had
a good reason.
 Once a murderer... You said it.
 Look, just tell me
where you've sent them.
 For Greg's sake. He didn't kill
anyone! I'm sorry.
 I wish I could help.
 Come on, let's go. Just move.
 It's all right, we'll find them.
 What's the plan?
 We don't know where we're going.
 Stand still!
 My name is Mr Smithson.
I am your new protector.
 With a quick word of advice -
work hard, survive.
 A simple equation.
 The meaning of life.
 This is a coal mine.
 The past is the future.
 You can't do this.
 Yes, we can.
 # And I turned 21 in prison
doing life without parole
 # No one could steer me right
But Mama tried, Mama tried
 # Mama tried to teach me better
But her pleading I denied
 # That leaves only me to blame
cos Mama tried... #
 It's Billy!
 Didn't you see us
on the road back there?
 World of my own, behind the wheel.
 Something isn't right here.
 Don't stray too far.
It's easy to get lost around here.
 What the hell is this? Put me down!
 We need to reinvent society.
 What kind of people are you?
Look out!
 No-one has the right to treat
a fellow human being like this.
 He has to learn who is master here.
 Help!
 You think it's funny to put men in
chains and make them slaves?
 Got to get our world
working again, haven't we?
