 The survivors are living in a country house when a band of, chiefly young, people turn up, a ragged crew 'led' by John, a supposed visionary. Despite initial misgivings Abby lets them camp in the grounds where Al tries to get cosy with one of the girls, Louise.Another girl, Linda, is heavily pregnant.

 Can you feel His presence? Do you hear Him calling His children? Do you hear the wind whispering your name? Once all I heard were aeroplanes and cars and radios and computers and televisions, great babble of voices filling my head with so much noise it might burst. And then, the great silence came and there was only Him at last, whispering to me gently of His infinite love. He told me, walk away from the cities of the dead and build a new world, a decent place

 where all His children live in peace and harmony with the Earth. Follow me, and I'll take you home. How are the blood samples? She has a high number of antibodies, but there's nothing unusual in the immune response. It's what I'd expect to see in a normal flu virus. - What about the lung biopsy? - The same. You're not looking closely enough at the lungs. There may be more virus damage there. The immune response could be clearer. It's possible. But that would require a post-mortem. And she isn't dead. Prepare the lab for pathology. You heard what I said.

 - What's your name? - Najid. - We have nothing worth stealing. - I'm not a thief. - We saw you sneaking around. - I wasn't sneaking, I live here. - Are you a preacher? - In a way. What religion are you? All religions and none. - Do you believe in God, Najid? - Of course! I wish everyone was like you. My job would be a lot easier. We've met a lot of thieves on our travels. We rushed to judgment on an innocent, and that was very wrong. Sorry, son. You should meet my friends. That was lovely. I'd forgotten how much fun sex can be. If you want someone to tell you how beautiful you are, I'm not the one. I'm starting to wonder if you even like me. Sure you want me to answer that? It's OK, I'm just kidding. I really like you, Tom. Naj? Where are you? Let him go! It's all right, Anya. They're OK, honest. What do you want? I'm John. They're good people. You shouldn't have brought them to the house. We didn't have much choice. He's a nice guy. Some sort of preacher. - That's reassuring. - They've been sleeping rough. I know, Naj, it's just we have to be so careful. They just need somewhere to stay for a bit, that's all. It's not a good idea. - There you go, guys. - Thank you. - How many weeks? - 38. My first two kids were both early, so this one won't be long. Aren't you scared about having a baby now? Why? It's the most natural thing in the world. And John says nothing will go wrong. I'd still fancy having a doctor for back-up. That's because you don't trust in a higher power. Don't you start. I get enough of that from Naj. But I'm always open to a theological discussion. What's he doing? He's talking to God. - You mean praying? - If you like. What are you looking at? There are patterns in everything. You just have to know how to read them. What is it that you need from us? - Nothing you don't want to give us. - That's not an answer. My people are tired and hungry. Your people? My family, friends. I don't know what else to call them. Najid said that you were some kind of preacher. Is that what you were before? I was an architect. I used to build car parks. That's not important now. Linda's baby is due. We'd like to rest here until it's born. I think it's a stupid risk, we don't know anything about 'em. All that New Age religious stuff, it just gives me the creeps. He's a bit weird, but he seems harmless enough. I don't want them here. - Linda's nine months pregnant. - That's her problem. Hands up who wants them to go. And in favour of letting them stay? I know why you're on their side. Just doing the Christian thing. - You're a Muslim. - Figure of speech. - We can't spare the resources. - We can manage. Look, these people need our help. All right. But just until the baby's born. With Naj, that's four to three. Oh, come on! He doesn't get a vote, he's just a kid. He has the same rights as the rest of us. All of a sudden we're a democracy, are we? You're making a mistake. This is lovely. Isn't the furniture nice, John? Thank you. I know your food and water are precious. - We can spare it. - For a few days. You're a good man, Greg. I can see it. Don't count on it. Look, anything you need, you just shout, OK? Don't worry about me. I've done this before. I can pop them out like shelling peas. Do you really believe all that God stuff? God, nature, call it what you want. John is a prophet. Every word he says is true and beautiful. Such as? The Earth was out of balance. We abused our environment and destroyed the harmony of nature. The virus was our punishment. Like Noah's flood. Only not as wet. Come on! You really believe that? If you listen to John, it all makes sense. He made me see how beautiful the world is, how life could be good again, maybe even better than it was before. Look, why do you hate me? I don't know you. But you don't want me here. Why not? Because you're exploiting some very vulnerable and traumatised people. You have such sadness, Anya. I can see it in you. Is that supposed to qualify as an insight? I had family, and friends, lovers, and a world I knew. And the virus took that away from me. Yes, I'm sad. But you feel your sadness will overwhelm you and every day it gets worse. I can help you live again. Get away from me. I can feel it kicking! My first two were girls, so I'm saying boy this time. Here. Look, don't fuss, John. I'm not sick, I'm having a baby. I wish there was more we could do for you. Don't worry. God told me nothing will go wrong. - How did He tell you? - By talking to me. How many babies has God delivered? What do you believe in, Abby, if you don't believe in God? Come on, Naj. Linda needs to rest. The truth frightens you. You don't give up easily, do you? You really believe He talks to you? I hear Him as clearly as talking to you now. And how do you know it's God? How many other invisible, supernatural beings are there? You don't have to call it God if it makes you uncomfortable. It's just a word for something greater than ourselves and that's all. There's such beauty in the world. If only we could all learn to embrace it. It's a strange time to talk about beauty when people have lost everything. We can wither in grief, or we can choose to live again. Which would you prefer? Have you met many other survivors on the road? A few groups, here and there. Were there any boys? About 12 years old? Your son? A handful. I'm sorry, I didn't ask any names. What makes you think he's alive? Instinct... Hope, I don't know. But you feel it deep inside. A conviction that he's not dead. Some days I'm so certain. Well, perhaps, then, Abby, God talks to you as well. You just don't recognise His voice. Louise? I just wondered if... if you fancied a nightcap. I don't drink. But we can make love, if you like. - What's the scam? - I don't understand. What is it? The house? The food? What? You might be able to fool your little gang of misfits and losers, but I don't buy into it. There's so much hatred in your heart. But God still loves you. Do your friends know the kind of man you are, Tom? Have you ever shown them your true face? You don't know when to shut up, do you? You can't hide your nature forever. But you can still... be a better man. Maybe. Not just yet. Does anyone actually know how to do this? Having a baby doesn't make you an expert in delivering them. There's no need to worry. Everything will be fine. God told you. Yes, we know. You just keep believing that. I've never been camping before. I could get used to it. You could join us. We could be together all the time. Early days, darling. Let's take it one step at a time, eh? Excuse me. Easy, mate! - This is private. - Did you have a good night? Yes, thanks, since you ask. - What the hell was that about? - Mike's my boyfriend. - He was probably checking up on me. - Excuse me? Oh, don't worry. I don't keep any secrets from him. This whole thing was his idea anyway. What? The world needs children now. The more men I sleep with, the more chance I have of getting pregnant. That's why you slept with me? You wanted me and I want to have a baby. What's wrong with that? - I thought you liked me! - I do. You used me! This is seriously out of order. - Why isn't the baby coming? - Something's wrong. You'll be fine. She needs help. You're a doctor. I was. I'm not now. What does that mean? It means I can't help. I don't care whether she lives or dies. She means nothing to me. Just ask yourself how you'll feel if something goes wrong. Please, John. Do something. I'll pray. Lie down. Oh, God! You're doing really well. My head hurts... and I'm too hot. And there's a lump. - It's all right, I'm a doctor. - What? - Did you know about this? - It's news to me. - What did you say you did before? - Systems analyst. Well, that's handy. It's a breech. The baby's coming out bottom first. Will it be all right? It's too late to do an ECV. I can't turn the baby, it'll rupture the uterus. I need a midwife. I need a midwife! I'm sorry, I can't do this. If you don't go back in there, she might die. I'm not qualified to handle a breech. - You have to do this. - I can't. I can't. That night... I watched them all die. One after another, until they all died, and there was nothing I could do to help them. Listen to me. Listen to me. You cannot blame yourself for that. There was no cure, no-one could help. I held her in my arms... This woman I'd held so many times before. She was my friend and my lover, and she begged me to help her, and I couldn't do it. I watched the life drain out of her. I couldn't save her. - But you can save someone now. - I can't, she'll die. God sent you to us. He won't desert you now. What about Pat and Jenny? What about all the others? Why did he desert them? Listen. You know, maybe he's right. Maybe there's some mad reason for all this. So you just do it for all the people that you loved. You do it for yourself. You're fully dilated, the baby's ready. You're going to be fine. I can't feel the cord. That's good. Help us, God. As soon as you feel a contraction, I want you to push as hard as you can, and let me worry about everything else. Come on, Linda, breathe! That's good. I am so never having a baby. Good girl. - Can I get you anything, Tom? - Is she all right? She is now. Anya's a doctor. You already knew, didn't you? That's it! It's coming. - Come on, Linda. - That's fantastic. Thank you, God. - It's a boy. - Is he all right? Well done. He's fine, he's perfect. She's crashing! She must have some kind of heart condition. She can't die! Please! Please, God. Get him away from her. Come on, let us help her. We're gonna help her. - Don't, please! - Get her down the bed. I am not losing you. She's back. It's getting stronger. I got her back. I got her back! Thank you! Thank you, God. Well done, Anya. This one's for Abby. And I'll get you a vodka. Just kidding. Thank you. So, how's he doing? Healthy and strong. Will he be immune to the virus? Linda was. So with any luck, he'll inherit it from her. Maybe it's gone now anyway. Something tells me this little one's going to live. We really don't know anything about each other, do we? We've lived together all these weeks and... and we're still strangers. Maybe it's better that way. You like to think you don't need anyone, but you do. You're psychoanalysing me now? - Somebody should. - Somebody has. - You were in therapy? - For about a year. What are you looking at me like that for? You just don't seem the type. I mean, did you... did you actually talk? No, not much. You know what I've noticed? That you don't say much about leaving any more. Doesn't mean I'm not still thinking about it. You wouldn't be getting attached to us, would you? - There you go. - Cheers. - I thought you didn't drink. - It's a special occasion. I'm sorry. I should have told you. I do like you, Al. Really. I want us to be friends. What kind of friends? Are you talking to God now? I don't understand the pattern. I've been counting the bubbles. Every one means something. I just don't know what yet. Are you OK? John's talking to God in his champagne glass. I think he's drunk. Are you coming to the party, Tom? Why didn't you tell me you were a dyke? Sorry... Lesbian. That's a nice word for it, innit? All that stuff you were saying about the... woman you love. It made me want to throw up. I don't have to justify my life to you. I like to know who I'm dealing with. You want to know what we did together? Is that it? Shall I tell you the details so you can play them over like some dirty little pornographic movie? Will you stop it?! I fell in love with a girl. I didn't expect it. I didn't plan it. It just happened. And for a while, it was great. And then it ended. It just didn't work any more. Maybe I am a lesbian. Maybe I'm not. I didn't have a chance to find out. I think I'd know if I was a queer. I don't fall in love with women, Tom, or men. I fall in love with people. You've been with blokes? Yes, I've been with blokes. Does that make you feel better? Get out. Does it matter who we sleep with, Tom? Does it really matter? Just... ask yourself one thing. Why are you so angry? - We have to protect the baby. - Of course we will. - God spoke to me. - What did He say? I couldn't hear Him. Don't do that, love. I couldn't hear Him over the other voices. - You're tired. You need to rest. - I can't rest! I can't sleep! Lie down here. You'll sleep next to me. You always do. They want to hurt the baby. Who does? No-one wants to hurt the baby. You're imagining it. The voices told me. But we know they're not real, don't we? Only God's voice is real. Mike looked after me when I first joined. He looks after everyone. He helps us find food and places to live. He's a good man. But you don't love him. I want to. You're sure he's OK about this? He doesn't know. I told him you and I were finished. Seeing us together upset him. He changed his mind. He wants me to have a baby, but he wants it to be his. We'll be leaving soon. Come with us. - What about Mike? - He'll have to accept it. I'm sorry. I don't think it's going to happen. - I thought you liked me. - I do. I do. Listen, if you want to hang out here for a while, that's great, we've got plenty of room. I can't leave John. I love him. - You're certainly spreading your love. - Not like that. He knows things. He made me see how everything happens for a reason. It's a pity. It might have been fun. You know what? You need to get away. - Make your own life. - If I leave John, - I'll have nothing. - You're frightened. We all were for a while. You just latched on to the first person that tried to make any sense out of anything. You know he's full of crap, don't you? See you later. What's going on with you and Tom? Why don't you ask him? You've had your chance. Stay away. It's not funny. Trust me, if... Give him to me! - Sorry. He was crying. - You can't have him! - What's going on? - She was trying to steal the baby. What? That's ridiculous. You want him to replace the son you lost. She didn't mean any harm. She was trying to help. - You can't have him! - Please, just go. You shouldn't have messed with that girl. Will Linda be all right? If she has a heart condition, there'll always be a risk. You could come with us when we leave. Look after Linda and the baby. - I can't do that, John. - I want you to. This is my home. Who told you Abby was trying to steal the baby? I don't know. But it wasn't anyone you know, was it? You heard a voice. When did you first hear God talking to you? After the virus. He told me what to do. And you didn't hear Him before? I knew He was there. But there was always... this fog, and I couldn't hear Him in the fog. Did you take pills before the virus, John? Or go to the doctor for an injection? Were you taking any medication? I can't remember. I can help you. - We can find the pills you used to... - They told me I was ill, but they were making me ill! Doctors, like you. Talking about me behind my back, planning things. They hated me. - I don't hate you. I want to help you. - I don't need your help! You're trying to trick me. You want to hide God from me again! Is John sick? I think so. I think he might be a schizophrenic. Do you know what that is? You'll have to come with us. Linda needs you. We don't understand what's happened. Why we left so suddenly, why Anya is with us, and why you locked her in the vestry. - She's here to look after the baby. - But she didn't want to come. How do you know? Did you talk to her? Are you planning something? Of course not. It's just... - we can all see she's unhappy. - Are you questioning me? All of us are here because we want to be, because we love each other. - It makes no sense to force anyone. - What do you know about it? God speaks to me, not you! I know what's right and no-one else! Do you understand?! Stop looking at me. All of you, stop looking at me! And she said nothing to any of you? - They've taken her. - Maybe she wanted to go with them. Maybe she got religion. - She'd never leave without goodbye. - On foot, They can't have got far. There are a million houses out there that they could hide in. - Are you gonna look in every one? - If we have to, yes. Are you going? I'm sorry. I've never seen him like this before. - He's ill. You know that, don't you? - There's a back door. Go quickly. - You've got to help him. - You don't understand. Please, no! I'm sorry. It's all right, darling. You didn't mean to. Let me look at it. I'm all right. Mike, no! I don't want to hurt you. Just tell us where she is. I won't let you hurt us. You're with them! - You're against me, too. - I'm not against you. Please let her go. Easy, John. Bring me the baby. - Don't do this. - Bring him! Listen. You're not well. Let me help you. Tom, no! He's sick. It's all right, darling, it's all right. I won't let them hurt you. What are you going to do now? - We'll find another way to live. - We'll be all right. Good luck! He needs antipsychotics. See if he can remember what he used to take. If not, try him on Haldol, 30 milligrams a day. You can find it in the pharmacies. What will the drugs do to him? Control his mood swings. Stop him from feeling paranoid. Will he still hear his voices? I can't take God away from him. He has to take his medication. He found me, and took care of me. He gave me new hope. It's my turn to take care of him now. He's a paranoid schizophrenic. One day, he can hurt himself. Or one of you. My heart might stop beating tomorrow, or it might give me another 50 years. Well, none of us know for sure what's gonna happen next. And he has the baby to think about now. You'd be amazed at what love can do. Are you all right? Fine. Fiona Murray. We're trying to get to the Western Isles, if we can. I'm William Arnott and I'm 54 years old. I'm going north to find my daughter, Sadie. My name's Abby Grant. I'm looking for my son, Peter. And a man called Phil Emerson, who was with him. I got the virus. I wasn't immune. I nearly died. But I recovered. I don't know why. I was just... lucky. He's gone. Doesn't he know what the city's gonna be like now? I will not allow murder to go unpunished. - Don't you dare bring my son into this. - We make our own law now. The restoration of full government. Bringing you here was the first useful thing Darren has done in weeks. Drop it! That's it. We've got nothing left. We've got no food, no water.
