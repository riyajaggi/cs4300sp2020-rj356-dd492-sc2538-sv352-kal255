 Where are you going? I couldn't sleep. And we need supplies, so I thought I'd go on the road early. Maybe you should wait till the others are up. I'll be fine. Just wanted to be on my own today, that's all. Don't move! She said she just wanted to be on her own. Well, is that safe? It's not like she can't take care of herself, is it? I mean, it's Abby, you're not gonna mess with her, are you?

 You're not gonna mess with her. Shouldn't someone go after her? She's not a child. She can do what she wants. Yeah, but it's dangerous out there! Being afraid isn't a way to live. Yeah, we gotta be careful, but we shouldn't be scared. Ready? - Where are you going? - Petrol. Be good. So, anywhere with a fuel supply that isn't a petrol station. Which is where, exactly? Farms. Lorry depots... Why do you think Abby wanted to be on her own? - No idea, thought you'd know that. - I don't.

 Oh, well. Keep working on it. "Little pig, little pig, let me come in!" But the little pig knew that it was the big bad wolf. - So the little pig said... - "Go away, or I'll fart on you!" Dad... - Those crows are back. - Near the house? There's something in the garden that's bringing them. Something dead. If it's carrion, I'll have to burn it. They're just birds. Maybe they'll fly away. And after the birds, it'll be the rats and the dogs. We can't risk it. No contact of any kind with any living thing. I know. You did well telling me. Can I go? Then you could tell me what to do. I'd be so careful. Push this back when I've gone. There's lights. Are they hurting your eyes? I just wanna know where I am. - You, you shot at me. - I shouted a warning. - There was a siren. - I told you not to move! I couldn't hear... - God, my head! - You hit it when you fell. We don't have a doctor, but we have medicines, painkillers. Do I know you? Could you sit, if I helped? - I don't understand. - There was a raid. Gavin thought that you were a part of it. I mean, I don't understand this place. You have electricity. We've more than that. Some water. Thank you. - Are there children here? - Just one. This is Lily. I am so sorry for what happened to you. But you are safe. This is a good place. I do know you! You're in the government. I am the government. What's left of it. Samantha Willis. - Abby Grant. - You're very welcome here, Abby. Very welcome indeed. Secret, OK? Mustn't tell. Any sign of a farm? I used to have an Action Man like you, same binoculars and everything. Only, he was a little bit more talkative. What do you want me to say? The part of conversation is I don't know what you're going to say. That's what makes it interesting. Eagle Eyes. The Action Man with the binoculars. God help me, I think we're bonding! - Who the hell's that? - God knows. Let's see where they're going. I'm sorry. - I don't think it saw us. - What did you think? It's a game and you can break the rules, as long as I don't catch you? It's not just the helicopter, there's animals out there. No contact, of any kind, with any living thing! - I know. - Well, then, act like you know! I'm sorry. It's not your fault. It's my job to keep you safe, I shouldn't expect you to do it for me. I'm all right. It's fine. I don't mind. But it's not your responsibility. You were so little when your mum died, and it seems so long ago. I forget how young you still are. Do you think that... the helicopter came to help? I don't know. I don't know. Take Davy. Get upstairs and stay there. Are you sure this is where it was heading? - I'm sure it came this way. - There's nothing going on here now. What's this? Come on! Back up! Get us out of here! Hold on! In here! Well, we know one thing's for sure. Where there's petrol bombs, there's petrol. Sorry. - I didn't mean to... - When's Greg coming back? I don't know. Abby said that... the guy you were with died. I wasn't with him. Good. I mean... I'm glad you weren't that close. It's just that you seem very upset. Those men. They took everything. They can't hurt you here. It must have been horrible. If you need to cry about it... Where the hell is Najid? I found this in my room, doing... something on my bed. An egg? They got out! The chickens, they escaped. Something attacked them. There's feathers and stuff everywhere. - How many are left? - Four. Right, well, if we're going to keep animals, let's do it properly! When we found the chickens, they were in a big shed with a fence around it. Right, we're going to need wood, wire mesh, nails and a hammer. You all right? I'm no good with my hands. I wouldn't know where to start. You've had a rough time. I understand. Maybe you ought to sit this one out. What? She's very vulnerable. Al, you're priceless! "If you need to cry about it." That was a private conversation! Chickens. Concentrate! Come on then. They've gone. They weren't coming to help us, Kate. They weren't a rescue! - You don't know that. - No contact of any kind! Well, you didn't find out! I couldn't risk it! We don't know anything. It could be carried by anything, anything! Yeah, but, what if it's over? Maybe the wind blew it away. Maybe it's all right now. Then this is never going to end, is it? What are you doing? Keeping you safe. - Help me. - You're gonna make it dark. - I need your help! - I don't want to live in the dark! The car. Did you see... Did anyone get out? Thanks. How do you do this? This place was an eco-centre. It has its own water supply, its own generators, solar panels. Freezers full of food. And by the time that runs out, we should be starting to work the land again. But it's not just the place, is it? I mean, it's... It's you. You have a... You have a plan, don't you? A vision. I just know none of us can do it alone. The rest falls into place around that. There's this kid, Najid. He... he would just love this. Oh, well, actually, except the chicken dinner. We've just started keeping hens and he's our egg Tsar. He's very protective. Maybe you should bring him... and the others, if you think they'd be interested. I'm telling you, make an example of one, the others respect it. Let them get one over on you, even once, and they'll tear you apart! There's a lot here to want. Unfortunately, at the moment, that makes us a target. But there's enough for everyone. And that's what we have to make people understand. We can make life good again. But only if we work together. These areas indicate known groups of survivors. How many? How many people are left? I'm projecting a national survival rate of less than 1%. That's worse than I expected. But there is something, the new vaccine is ready. That's good news. The best we've had in a long time. I think this calls for a drink. To all your hard work, and your team's, of course. I should be the one to test it. You're my leading research scientist. - You're too valuable. - I insist. I'm responsible... for everything. If that's what you want. If you're not too tired, there's one more thing I'd like to show you. It's not quite up and running yet, but when it is, this is where we're going to be watching and listening 24 hours a day. For what? Anything. Anything at all. There's more... Rob, could you? I'm William Arnott, and I'm 54 years old. I'm going North to find my daughter, Sadie, in Carlisle. She wasn't sick, when I spoke to her. My name is Amandeep Singh. I'm 21 and I'm heading to Brighton to look for my family. My name is Rhona Dixon. Fiona Murray. We're trying to get to the Western Isles. If we can. That's everyone who's passed through here so far. We'll show that to everyone in the future, just like we've shown it to you. Because one day, you might meet Sadie, from Carlisle, and you'll be able to tell her that her father's alive and he's looking for her. Strangers carrying around each other's stories. That's how people are going to start finding each other again. It's recording. My name's Abby Grant. I'm looking for my son, Peter. And a man called Phil Emerson, who was with him. How old is your son? He's 12. He's 12 today. I got the virus. I wasn't immune. Erm, I nearly died. But I recovered. I don't know why. I was just... lucky. I'm hoping that Peter's the same. Whatever it is that saved me, perhaps it saved him too. That's what I believe. If he was dead, I'd know. Good. If they'd seen us get out, they'd have come by now. Which means no-one knows we're here. Where do you think they keep the petrol? We have no idea how many of them there are out there. - It's what we came for, Greg. - They were happy to kill us! They probably think that we went up in the car. Besides, they're not gonna expect... Hello. I'm Kate. Do you want some chocolate? So when did you find out what it was gonna do? Too late. They were working on a vaccine. They thought they could do it. They said they needed months. We said, "No, weeks." But it was days. What was it like? Sorry? Having it. My children, they... Did it hurt? At first, it felt like it was never gonna end. And I wanted it to. I wanted it to be over. But then it was... It was like floating. We have hot water. It's only for two hours a day at the moment, but there should be enough for a bath. If you want one. A bath? You mean I get to wash all of me at once? Thank you. He won't come after you. I told him no-one got out. I'm glad you're all right. You're nice. Nice people. And you're a sweetheart for saying so. So there's just the three of you? You, your brother and your dad? Yeah, but I sneaked out, he doesn't know I'm here. He's with Davy. He's five, but he still has a nap. My dad never used to be like this. He would never hurt anyone. He's just so scared. Of what? Everything. Cos no-one knows how the illness is carried, do they? But... you're all right. You didn't get it. Me dad cooked this sausage thing, right? And he didn't cook 'em properly. And we were really, really sick. By the time we were better, then... Everyone was dead. And you haven't been in contact with anybody since? You won't tell him I said that, will you, about the sausages? Normally he's a really good cook, just... not that time. - They got through the perimeter fence. - Where? By the greenhouses. Glass everywhere. - What's happening? - Raiders, they're in the grounds. Janine, check on Lily. We need to seal the break in the perimeter, others could follow. What about the ones already through? Do we go after them? Our priority is to prevent further attack. With all respect, you're wrong. They've came back once. If we don't hit them now, and hit them hard, they'll be back again. - Our breach needs to be dealt with! - And again and again. And they will take this place from us, because we're too weak to hold on to it. I am not authorising a manhunt! You don't have to. They're in the building, two of them, in the service corridor. Right, let's go, move! What do you want us to do? Listen to me. This place, what you're doing, it's everything I've been dreaming of. Just let me know what you need me to do. We need to secure the perimeter. - I'll go after Gavin. - Thank you. I have to get back! We didn't get ill, but that doesn't mean we're not carrying it. Well, what if he finds out I'm gone? You don't understand. You've sat with us, you've eaten with us. If you've got it and you go back, then... But I want to go home. I'm sorry. You are just like him. You think you know what's going to happen, but you don't, no-one knows. No-one knows anything! And you think I don't understand, but I do! Mum died when Davy was a baby. I know what dead is. But there's more to being alive than just breathing. It's dark in there, and we can't get out. And I don't want to be locked up any more. Let her go. What? It would be kinder. There are so many dead children. He's kept his alive. Didn't you hear her? He's still got something, he still has his son. Didn't you listen to her? That house is a coffin with them all locked up inside, waiting to die. They're his children. The life that he's giving them isn't worth living. Don't. His children. His! I just... She's been with us. Look, we're not sick. But we could be carriers. Come on! There he is! Look here, I'm sorry. It's OK. It's OK. Nice one. Just... All right, let him. He ain't going anywhere. I think we can deal with this. - Now, what do you say, guys? - Gavin! Well done. Let's get them somewhere secure. Why wait? What's wrong with here and now? Because we are building the future, and this is not how it starts. They broke the law, and they'll be dealt with under the law. What law? There is no law. There's nothing. There's just this. Government, order, society, none of it means anything any more! Well, of course it does. If it didn't, you'd be living like them! Scavenging, fighting each other for scraps. The reason you're not is her. Because she does know what society means. There is enough for everyone, without cutting each other's throats for it! Get everyone into the amphitheatre. - What? - Everyone, now, please! All right. Samantha wants everyone in the amphitheatre, now! Come on! Rob, get some men you trust. I want you to stay with those two. Thank you. Look at them. They're not going to run away. It's not them I'm worried about. Gavin thinks we need a show of strength. There's probably others who think the same. A lynching would fit the bill. Abby said we have to be like farmers. I don't care what Abby said. She's not here to build it, is she? Crap. Maybe we could start again, make it more solid. Maybe Al should have kept it into pieces in the first place. - It was crap anyway. - That's all right then, isn't it? They're cross. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry... for, messing it up. But we can't do this ourselves. We don't know how to. We have to. It's important. I know. That's why I'm going to sort it out. All right? I'll be back. So, what happens next then? You got a plan? I thought not. I used to have a dream, you know, about being locked up. I thought I was going to die like that. Never get out. You were right. Everything you said to us was right. I just want my dad. I'm sorry. We'll take her with us. There's a group of us, we're like a family. We'll take care of her. She won't be alone, she won't be scared. She's lovely. You've done a great job. Everything you'd have done, everything you'd want for her. It's my privilege. We've worked together, and we've tried, really tried, to start building a future here. This is where we decide what kind of future that's going to be. You are accused of breaking into our home and of stealing food and medical supplies held for the common use. How do you plead? I'm sorry. What is this? This is crap. This is all a load of crap. If there's anything you'd like to say in your own defence, please say it now. Like I said... Can I say something? He gave back what they took, before he was caught. Thank you. I'd now like to ask all of you to say whether you think the accused are guilty or not guilty. What's the point? We all know they did it. So, guilty or not guilty? Guilty as charged. Under the law. Janine? Guilty. Rob, guilty or not guilty? Guilty. Take Lily away, please. I think she's a bit young for this, thank you. But I don't want to go! You can't go back. But Davy won't know where I've gone. He'll think I've left him! This is the best way. No, don't take me away from my dad. - Please, don't take me away from... - Kate, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. There's nothing I can do now. Dad! Daddy! Please. - Come with me. - What are you doing? She needs to say goodbye. Dad? Daddy?! Can you hear me? You need to listen to her. I don't want to say goodbye. I want you. I want Davy. I just want things to be like they used to be. I love you, Daddy. I love you so much. Go with Greg, sweetheart, and wait for me. This is the worst thing that's happened to her. But it won't be the worst thing that happens to you. I don't know hom much food you got in there, but when you start to run out, you're not gonna let go. You're gonna stretch it out... and you're gonna keep stretching it out. And it's gonna be really, really slow. But you know that, don't you? You know, that's really all that you've got to give your little boy. Or, you can choose today. Sun's out. Bit nippy, but this time of year, what do you expect? And as your daughter said, no-one really knows what's gonna happen. You don't have to do this any more. You can live instead. Daddy! You've been found guilty by a unanimous verdict. The law says you should be punished, but we don't have the resources to impose a custodial sentence. Therefore, I have no choice but to pass a sentence of death. What? - Don't you dare. - What would you have me do? - What would you do? - Not this! That's not an answer. That doesn't help me. I cannot let this fail. It just has. You're wrong. You've got what you wanted, so you can stop now. It's OK. It's all right, you're all right. You returned what you stole. Your sentence is commuted. Justice and mercy. This is our law. You know, we're totally confident. I've looked closely at the vaccine research and it's impeccable. There's nothing at all to worry about. And I'd like to thank you for your courage. We're not the only ones. There are survivors everywhere. People live, you know? The thought of Davy being alone. That finishes me. The rest... It's a good life. Thanks. We'll bring the car back. Looking for her son Peter, 12 today. There's an estate called Waterhouse. Somewhere east of here. I've heard there may be children there. Voil?! How on earth did you manage that? Garden centre, piece of cake. - Perfect! - Thank you! Look at Naj. Never seen him so happy. Maybe he'll move in with them! Come on, we're naming the chickens. - Why? - Cause no-one eats pets with names. Got to be something that suits them. - Nugget? - Something nice. Korma? - What happened to you? - Car crash. Suits you. Both. Are you OK? We're naming the chickens. You can have one, but you'll have to share. - Otherwise Abby won't get one. - She not back yet? That one there. Eagle Eye. What do you reckon? Look at him. He knows exactly what's going on. You couldn't get anything past him. It's a chicken, they're female. Silly me. What's that? It's your surprise. - We're having a party. - What's the occasion? It's my son's birthday, and I want to celebrate it. OK, Naj, do the honours. Three, two, one... You'd better come. There's a problem with the vaccine test. For God's sake, be careful. - How long has he been like this? - A few hours. - I should have been told! - BP is going through the roof. Oedema presence. At first we thought the vaccine was working, but then he started showing symptoms of the virus. His immune system has collapsed. This is my fault. We're losing him. Hold him, for God's sake. The risk of contamination is too great, there's nothing you can do. Come on, get out, all of you. You too, Sami. I'm so sorry. You do what you like. I'm not leaving him to die on his own. Cut my throat! Drive! Samantha Willis live here? Abby Grant sent us. You ever get your hands dirty? If you need anything, then... just ask. Morning. I've come for Peter. He's my son.
