 How many millions?
 We're talking more than 90%
of the world's population.
 That way of life has gone now -
 mobile phones, computers,
the electricity that powers them.
 All gone for good.
 They got the water!
 Everything we ever knew
has been ripped away from us.
 Our old life is dead.
 Now we have to build a new one.
 So few of us left.
Every new person feels like a gift.
 Three, two, one...
 Hey!
 We've located Abby Grant.
 And that one freak of nature
will be the key to our vaccine.
 Greg.
 You're going to be OK.
 - Abby!
- Stop!
 ...Thursday evening. '
 - Hey, kids!
- Daddy!
 - Hey! How was school?
- OK.
 - OK? It was OK? How are you, princess?
- OK.
 - Hello.
- Good day?
- Same old, same old.
 Matt doesn't want to go to the dentist.
Talk to him, will you?
 - I don't like the dentist either.
- Yeah, that's hardly a point. Oh!
 Good to be home.
 You're bleeding!
 Greg?
 Greg! Greg!
 Greg.
 I'm shot.
 Stay with me, Greg.
 You're going to be OK.
 Tom! I need to get him somewhere safe.
I have to operate.
 Look at me.
 Keep looking at me.
 He's losing a lot of blood.
We have to pull over now.
 Stay awake.
 Is he going to make it?
 I don't know. Help me get him out.
 He's cold.
 Shouldn't we lift his legs?
 Not with a chest wound.
I need to open it up, see how bad it is.
 He's going to be fine.
 Take it easy.
 All right?
 If I don't do this now,
he hasn't got a chance.
Clean towels.
 Get me the sharpest knives you can find.
 Bandages, alcohol, needles, thread, anything.
I'm going to operate.
 There's no exit wound,
which means the shot's still in there.
 I don't think anything vital's been damaged.
 To kill someone with a shotgun,
you have to get up close and personal.
 How do you know?
 I didn't know which colour to bring,
so I brought them all.
 She's stitching his chest,
not knitting a scarf.
Let's go.
 Here.
 Is that the best you could do?
 Tom, I need you here.
 - There's a killer out there.
- Hey, you heard her!
 Let go of him! Get off!
 You're knocking kids around now, too?
 Tom, please! I need you.
 What's... happening?
 It's OK.
 This is all my fault.
 I should just go.
 You all hate me anyway.
 Hold his arms. Legs.
 Shouldn't we be giving him some alcohol?
 Or maybe something to bite on.
That's what they do in the Westerns.
 Just... get on with it!
 She's in decent shape, considering.
 Some signs of malnutrition, protein deficiency,
 - but nothing serious.
- Good.
 The stronger she is, the better.
 We could start testing immediately,
but there's a danger she's too weak.
 It could take some time.
 There is no time.
 We can't afford any mistakes.
 Of course.
 I'm sorry, Fiona. It's your call.
 We all understand the
pressure you're under... James.
 She's coming round.
 I'll ask you one last time.
 Will you help us?
 Very well. I'm suspending you from duty.
 Make sure Fiona Douglas has all your research.
 How do you sleep at night?
 Don't you think
I'd prefer the luxury of compassion?
 She could be the key to the virus.
 We have no choice.
 Tweezers!
 OK.
 You're doing OK.
 - Is he going to be all right?
- There's a piece of shrapnel
 lodged close to the aorta.
 If it moves, it could slice through
the main artery of the heart.
 Right, so take it out.
 Not with a carving knife.
I need proper surgical equipment.
 I need drugs to fight the blood poisoning.
I need a hospital.
 I mean, there'll be bodies,
and it'll be full of disease and rats.
 I'll go with you.
 I'm in.
 Come here.
 Come here.
 Whatever happens, keep him still.
The slightest movement could kill him.
 Are you going to be OK?
 It's not me you should be worrying about.
 - All right, good lad.
- No!
 By the way, no-one hates you.
 Well, not me, anyway.
 I know this place. I worked here.
 Be careful with that.
You could hurt someone.
 - That's the general idea.
- What the hell happened?
 - We can find somewhere else.
- No, we're OK.
 The theatre's on the first floor at the end.
Down this way.
 It's too dangerous.
 It's either this or Greg dies!
We'll be fine.
 Al, you come with me.
Tom, go to the pharmacy.
 It's in the main block just past reception.
 Penicillin. It'll be written on the packets.
 - Hey, Al.
- Huh?
 Anything happens to her,
then you'll answer to me,
you understand that?
 Oh!
 This is insane!
 I need those packets.
 - What else?
- No, go, go!
 - What else?
- Go!
 Anya!
 Ah!
 Anya!
 Just keep still, OK?
 Anya said you shouldn't move.
 You're going to be OK.
She'll be back soon.
 I hate blood.
 It makes me feel faint.
 Get over it.
 I can't look after both of you.
 Thanks for your support!
 - Tom!
- Get in the car, both of you.
- What happened?
- I'll explain on the way.
 - Anya said we shouldn't leave him.
- He'll be all right.
 - We can't abandon him.
- If you want to see Anya again, get in the car.
 She needs us more than he does.
 Al!
 Tom!
 We were near the operating theatre
when the floor collapsed.
 Come on, get digging.
 Tom, no-one could have survived this.
 - Just dig.
- There's no point!
 We can't just stop.
 There's nothing we can do.
 We can't just give up.
They're not dead. Al!
 Al, where are you?
 He's right. We're going to find them.
 Anya!
 Abby?
 How are you feeling?
 - What's going on?
- Would you like some water?
 What is this place?
 Try to relax. All your questions
will be answered in due course.
 Stay away from me!
 - It's just a vitamin shot.
- Come near me with that thing
 and I'll stick it in your eye.
 Untie her.
 Easy.
 You were given a powerful
sedative to help you rest.
 Who are you?
 My name's James Whitaker.
 You kidnapped me.
 Where are my friends?
If you've hurt them!
 They're fine, so far as I know.
 Why have you brought me to this place?
What do you want?
 Try to rest now, Abby.
 - No-one's going to hurt you.
- No!
 - Try to rest.
- No! No!
 Get off me!
 No!
 The aggression's only to be expected.
 It would be safer to keep her restrained.
 If she's scared, she won't co-operate.
 Who is he?
 It doesn't matter, you don't know him.
 OK, what does he do?
 He's a civil servant.
He works for the government. He's...
 What's the point?
 We fell in love.
 You're not taking my kids.
I'm a good father.
 Help!
 Naj, stop.
 What was that?
 Help!
 We've got to move that slab.
 Moving!
 Help!
 Tom! Stop! You're making it worse!
 Naj, get out of the way!
 Anya...?
 Help!
 Anya!
 Anya!
 Al! Al!
 I'm here!
 Are you OK?
 I think so.
 I can't move.
 I can't see you.
 What's happening?
 The rubble keeps moving.
 I can't breathe.
 There's no air.
 Tom...
 Anya!
 Anya!
 It's useless.
 I can't do any more.
 Don't touch me.
 Tom, look!
 Over here!
 - Come on!
- You're scaring him!
 He thinks you're going to shoot him.
 It's all right.
 It's OK. It's not loaded, look. See?
 We just need some help, that's all.
 Our friends, they're trapped.
 - They're alive under that?
- We don't know.
 We're going to keep digging till we do.
 My name's Najid.
This is Tom and this is Sarah. Please help us.
 Don.
 We were sure there was no-one left alive inside.
We were so careful.
 We checked before we left.
 - What do you mean you checked?
- When we set fire to the place.
 Why would you do that?
 Some of us are trying to start a new life here.
 We've got to keep disease down somehow.
 Fire...
 - is the best way.
- Why not just leave?
 This is our home.
 We want to make it a decent place to live again.
 We want to help you. Come on.
 It's not weak to ask for help, Tom.
 Some people still care about each other.
 People like you?
 Make yourself useful...
and pick up those bullets.
 Al... can you move towards me?
 - There's a gap.
- Can you get to it?
 I think so.
 No!
 Please!
 Greg!
 Take your hands off her!
 - What are you doing here?
- I just...
 - Greg, what are you doing here?
- Come on, mate.
 Stop it!
 Think you can break up my marriage, take my kids?
It's not happening!
 I gather you've had something to eat.
 A ham sandwich.
 - I haven't had fresh bread for months.
- We make our own here.
 Our technique's a little haphazard.
 You'd think a group of brilliant scientists
 would be a little better at baking bread.
 If I don't get some answers soon,
 I will wipe that smug expression off
your face and stick it down your throat.
 I realise how disturbing this must be for you,
 but believe me,
we had good reasons to act as we did.
 Why are we talking through this?
 No-one here is immune.
 Direct contact with you might kill us.
 But you've kept yourself alive all these months.
 That doesn't make sense.
 We were well prepared.
 Well... How?
 The virus happened so suddenly.
 You couldn't possibly have
had time to set this place up.
 We knew about the virus before the crisis.
 No, no. Nobody knew.
 Why didn't you warn us?
 By the time we found out,
it couldn't be stopped.
 - Are you government?
- Not... directly.
 For many months now,
we've been attempting to find a vaccine.
 To my deepest regret, we couldn't
do it before so many lives were lost.
 Do you know why it started
and where it came from?
 The first cases
 were reported in China.
 As to why a common flu virus
should mutate so dramatically...
 Just now, I'd rather discuss
why you are so important to us.
 You're the only person
we've discovered so far
 who contracted the full-blown virus
and yet ultimately recovered.
 But... But I'm not the only survivor.
 In every other case,
 the human immune system proved
totally resistant to the infection.
 The difference is...
you weren't immune.
 You should've died.
 Yet somehow, your body
began producing antibodies
 that ultimately destroyed the virus.
 You're a...
 beautiful freak, Abby.
 If we can learn
why your body behaved as it did,
 we'll finally have a key to a vaccine.
 There's every chance the virus will mutate
 and it'll keep on changing,
 and sooner or later,
it'll finish the job it started.
 You mean it's not over?
 - It could all happen again?
- Exactly.
 And the chances are, next time...
even fewer of us will be immune.
 The human race could be utterly extinguished.
 We have to prevent that, Abby.
 We have to preserve
what's left of our future.
 Will you help us?
 We'll never do it like this.
 There's a man...
used to have a builder's yard.
 - He's got some specialist equipment.
- Why didn't you say so before?
 Some people would give you the shirt off their back.
He ain't one of 'em.
 - We'll have a chat. I'll persuade him.
- Force won't work.
 He's got people to protect him.
 There's a few hard men like
him round the city now.
 Try not to get involved.
 I'll go.
 - Maybe he'll listen to me.
- What makes you think that?
 He's a man, isn't he?
 Worth a shot.
 Everyone likes a pretty face.
 Fine. She's useless here anyway.
 Go on.
 You can do this.
 It's a piece of cake.
 Argh!
 Are you OK?
 It's a body.
 I can't...
 Al?
 I used to get asthma attacks.
 I can't breathe.
 Al... Al?
 - Tony Johnson.
- Sarah Boyer.
 Always a pleasure to see a new face, Sarah.
Not many about these days.
 You can get lost.
 We need heavy lifting equipment.
 A JCB, something like that.
 Can you help?
 Follow me.
 Listen to me...
 You're going to be OK.
 Keep calm and keep breathing.
 I don't want to do this.
 I want to die.
 You're not going to die.
 I'm not going to let you.
 Al, Al, talk to me!
 - About what?
- I don't know. Anything.
 I can't think.
 There's this movie...
 I saw... um...
 a Vincent Price thing.
 He bricked his wife up in a wall.
 All you could see were her eyes.
 Her fear.
 I'm scared.
 I don't want to be buried alive!
 That's not going to happen.
 We're going to get out of here
and get back to Greg.
 Al?
 What's the point, eh?
 Everything good died with the virus.
 Listen to me.
 After the virus...
 .. I tried to kill myself.
 But I couldn't do it.
 Something in me wouldn't let go of life.
 And you're just the same.
 All my friends... family...
 they're all dead.
 You still have friends.
 Abby, Najid... me.
 Anya...
 .. ever been in love?
 It didn't work out,
 but... yeah, I was.
 - Was it nice?
- Most of the time.
 I'd like to be in love.
 I think I'd be good at it.
 I think so too.
 Anya...
 .. are you in love with Tom?
 He thinks I'm special.
 But I'm not.
 One day he's going to realise
that and be disappointed.
 Al?
 Al?
 It's over.
 I'm tired now.
 I want to go to sleep.
 Al, I need you to stay awake.
 You tell Najid to be careful.
 Stay out of trouble.
 You tell him yourself.
 You tell him...
 .. you tell him I wasn't scared.
 Stay with me, Al!
 Al...!
 Stay with me!
 Al?
 Sorry, no ice.
 You want to be careful,
 a little thing like you,
the city's not safe any more.
 - I can handle myself.
- I bet you can.
 This is a nice setup.
 It takes a smart man to get
something like this together.
 It's not much, but it's home.
 A JCB'll just bring the whole
lot down on their heads.
 A trolley jack is safer,
can shift more weight.
 It may not look much,
but it could lift a truck.
 Have you got one?
 Yeah. I've got one.
 What have you got for me?
 Nothing.
 Why should I help you, then?
 I don't know, out of kindness?
 Survival is all about trade now.
 I'd have to be some sort of fool
to give it away for free.
 I told you, I've got nothing.
 I wouldn't say that.
 Top up?
 She's not going to help.
 You told her too much.
 She's an intelligent woman -
she deserves the truth.
 The truth?
 Everyone here has made terrible sacrifices, Abby.
 I had a wife and young son.
 I had to hide the truth from them,
because I couldn't save them.
 Now, if there's one thing I can do,
it's to make sure their deaths
 weren't in vain.
 I had a son too.
 He was away from home
when the virus struck.
 I don't know what happened to him.
 That must be hard.
 Do you think he could have been like me?
 That he might have got ill
and then recovered?
 It's possible.
 We could help you find him, if you like.
 If he's still alive.
 What kind of tests are we talking about?
 A few straightforward procedures,
nothing to worry about.
 The lads are helping your mate
load the stuff now.
 You don't have to do this.
 You must have had a family once,
kids of your own?
 - You can stop that.
- Let me go.
 Look, we made a deal -
this is business.
 You can walk away if you want,
but you'll get nothing.
The option is yours.
 I don't want you to kiss me.
 Don't tell me what to do.
 Please, don't do that!
 Don't talk!
 Please, don't... do what you want.
 I said, shut up!
 Inhale, please.
 Why won't anyone look at me?
 You're imagining it.
 Just one more test, nearly done,
it's called a bronchial lavage.
 We need to take a quick look
at the cells in your lungs.
 Sometimes they give us better
results than the blood, OK?
 I'm going to put the 50mls
of fluid into your lungs.
 Your natural instinct
will be to cough it up back up.
 That's fine, don't fight it.
 Daddy!
 We thought you were never coming back.
 Oh, I've got to be so careful.
 If the others knew you were here...
 I love you so much.
How could I ever let you go?
 She's got us a trolley jack.
 That should do the job.
 It's moving.
 You've earned it.
 Anya!
 Tom?
 Tom, I'm here!
 She's alive.
 Tom!
 - Anya!
- I'm here!
 - Anya!
- I'm here!
 Here!
 Anya, it's OK.
 I thought you were dead.
 Al! Al, where are you?
 You have to find him.
 Al!
 Al!
 Al, please!
 Al...!
 I've found him!
 But he's not moving.
 Gently now, lads. Gently.
 Wake up! Please!
 - Come on!
- Wake up!
 It's OK, it's OK.
 It's OK.
 We made it.
 We made it.
 We're alive.
 Are you OK?
 Never better, mate.
 Never bloody better.
 Are you all right, Fiona?
 Do you ever wonder... about her?
 What kind of person she is?
 How you would feel in her shoes?
 Of course. Empathy is what makes us human.
 But does that mean I question
the morality of what we're doing?
 No. Never.
 I feel sorry for her.
 I'd think less of you if you didn't.
 Initially, there was no sign of the virus,
 no... unusual white blood cell response
and no unexpected antibodies.
 Don't tell me she's normal.
 So I went back for a closer look at the blood.
 She's a miracle.
 A walking vaccine.
 We can bleed her
 to create an antiserum
 that will protect us from the virus
for up to three months at a time
 while we develop a permanent vaccine.
 But there is one problem.
 It's been too long since the crisis.
 Her blood it is no longer anywhere near so rich
 in M2 antibodies as it was then.
 So, what are you saying?
 To get the best results,
 we should reinfect her.
 Come with me.
 Who are you?
 It doesn't matter.
 If you stay here, they'll kill you.
 What's that? What's going on?
 Don't believe anything Whitaker says.
They'll never let you go.
 Without you, they can never come back.
 - Who?
- I don't know who they are.
 I just know they're waiting until it's safe.
 You're the key, Abby -
they know that now.
 They'll make you sick again. And they'll...
 .. and they'll keep you sick until
you give them the vaccine
 and then they'll leave you to die!
 What are they going to do with him?
What was he talking about?
 He's sick, Abby. Delusional.
 This confinement is enough to drive us all mad.
 I am sorry he frightened you,
but he'll be well looked after.
 Now please? Before you hurt yourself?
 Where is he? Where is he?
 There's blood over here.
 Over here.
 Get away from me.
 - Get him away!
- Hey, hey, hey.
- It's OK.
 Get him away!
 This way. This way.
 I think I've managed to remove all the shrapnel.
 How's he going to do?
 Good. If he makes it through the night.
 You... saved their lives today.
 I did it for you.
 - You think you can...
- Stop it!
 I'm... taking the kids on holiday.
 They need to get away from this.
 Is, um...
 Mark going with you?
 That's none of your business.
 He won't press charges as
long as you stay away from us.
 You need to take a good look at yourself, Greg.
 The, um... The violence...
 it wasn't me. I...
 I'm ashamed.
 I love you.
 It's too late.
 - Are you going to be OK?
- Sure.
 Take care of yourself.
 Let's take a look.
 Nice work, Doc.
 You'll do.
 So, what happens now?
 - It's obvious. We find Abby.
- How?
 - We haven't got a clue where she is.
- So we start looking.
 Bloody right!
 - OK, let's go.
- Not you.
 You don't stay.
 Not with us.
 - Greg, what are you talking about?
- He's out.
 Why?
 Tell them, Tom.
 Tell them why we're in this mess,
why I got shot.
 All right.
 All right, I'll do it for you.
 Because he killed a man in cold blood.
 Why don't you deny it?
 He can't, because it's true.
 This is what violence does.
Believe me, I know.
 It destroys everything,
and if we let him stay with us,
 it'll destroy us too.
So either he goes or I do.
 This is crazy.
You don't know what you're talking about.
 Trust me, I know.
 Think you can survive without this?
Without me?
 OK.
 Go ahead and try.
 Tom, wait! Don't go!
 Tom was a hero yesterday.
 - You have no idea what he did for us.
- I know what he'll do if he stays.
 God.
 OK, so we should start looking for Abby.
 Where? We can't stay here.
 There's no food, there's no water, it's not safe.
 What do we do?
Just give up and leave?
 Of course not. We want to find
Abby just as much as you do.
 But what if we don't find her?
 The one thing she'd expect me
to do is to keep you all safe.
 So, if that means calling off the
search one day, believe me, I'll do it.
 But not yet.
 OK?
 Not yet.
 My apologies, James. I'm late.
Do you have anything for me?
 We've completed our initial tests on Abby Grant.
 The results are promising.
 You think she's the one?
 We're almost certain of it.
 Well, if you're right, if this works,
 it means a new future for us all.
 We can finally go home.
 I'm doing everything
I can to make that possible.
 I know it. A new beginning, James.
 Hope never dies.
 No, sir.
 - Fire!
- Get off me!
 - Don't touch me!
- All right.
 I care about Abby too, as much as you.
 But if we stay here,
sooner or later we die.
 - Please, no.
- Open the door!
 I am the vaccine.
 No, don't go! Please don't go!
