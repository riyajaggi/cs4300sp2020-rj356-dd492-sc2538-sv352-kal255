 Survivors (2008â€“2010): Season 2, Episode 2 - Episode #2.2 - full transcript 
 Tom returns to the group with supplies, having seen gun-wielding men in gas masks round up other survivors into a van marked PSJ Laboratories, where Abby is being held and to which they travel. Whitaker has Abby re-injected with the virus to see how she survived, in order to make the cure. Once again she survives. Whitaker's wife, whom he has kept hidden until a cure is found, accidentally stumbles on Abby and other guinea pigs and is horrified. She cannot save the other captives but releases Abby,who returns to her friends.

 - I need a hospital.
- You kidnapped me.
 They'll never let you go.
You're the key, Abby.
 - Can't breathe.
- We should re-infect her.
 They'll make you sick again and
then they'll leave you to die!
 If the others knew you were here.
Don't tell me what to do!
 I thought you were dead.
 You don't stay, not with us.
 Tom was a hero yesterday.
 He killed a man in cold blood.
 Think you'll survive without this
and without me? Try it.
 To help you make up some of
the blood we've been taking.
 No.
 I want to see Whitaker.
Let me speak to Whitaker!
 - No! No!
- Hold her down.
 No! No!
 No, leave me!
 Now, you're going to
feel a sharp scratch.
 Arrgh! Arrgh!
 She didn't break the skin.
 Once I've distilled the
anti-serum from her blood,
 I'll have to inject
a control group
 and then expose them
to the infection.
 I'll need test subjects.
 I'll make sure you get them.
 Will the virus be worse for her
 the second time around?
 We don't know how it will be.
 No-one's ever lived
to be infected twice.
 No-one wants to leave.
 But there's no food,
 there's no water,
there's no alternative.
 We must get out of this city.
 You shouldn't be giving up on Abby.
 We've been looking through this stinking,
rotting city for ten days.
 Abby...
 Abby's gone, and us staying here
to die isn't going to change that.
 You've already given up.
 Najid, I'm sorry,
but you're just a kid.
 All right? I'm sorry the world
has turned to crap.
 But sorry doesn't help.
 We still have to live.
 You're not the boss.
No-one put you in charge.
 At least Tom wanted to find them.
At least he wanted to fight them.
 All right, Naj.
 If it wasn't for Tom,
you'd be dead.
 But you let Greg get rid of him
 and now you're letting him
forget about Abby.
 Excuse me. Najid!
 Naj... Naj,
we've looked everywhere.
 Every day for hours and hours.
 - We've done everything.
- Have you?
 Her body's starting to respond
to the virus.
 Keep me informed of any developments.
 Lucas. You'll hurt your eyes.
 James.
 James!
 Who's the best chap in the world?
 Tinky Winky.
 The best little chap
in the whole wide world.
 Hey...
 Sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 - It's just I can't do this any more.
- Of course you can.
 I thought it was going to be
weeks and it's been months.
 And you've managed so wonderfully.
 You're not here.
You don't see me. I'm so...
 Alive.
 You and Lucas, you're alive.
 But I am so desperate.
 - We could increase your dose.
- No, I don't want more drugs.
 James, I want to get out.
 I don't care if there are riots
and food shortages and people dying.
 I want to get out of here.
 You're being so brave.
 My brave girl.
But it's not over.
 The virus hasn't burnt itself out
 and it's so much stronger than we thought.
 Until we have a vaccine,
it could be you.
 It could be Lucas.
 But we're getting closer.
 I promise you.
Closer than we've ever been.
 You just have to hold on.
 You have to trust me
 and hold on.
 It looks clean.
Why do we have to boil it?
 Cos nobody wants to listen to you
puking all through the night... again.
 Now watch.
 Paddy's very old, I'm very lazy
 and we need you to learn
so you can look after us.
 I'm thirsty.
 Pick 'em up.
 There's nothing else.
 Cigarettes.
 Doesn't work.
 Does now.
 It's all right.
Go get the cigarettes.
 He's not gonna hurt you.
 What kind?
 You can choose.
 This is how you live?
Dog eat dog?
 Cos that's gonna kill us all in the end.
 Hey!
 Lee! Run! Now!
 Lee! Run! Let's get out of here!
Run! Run!
 Run!
 Run! Run!
 - Run!
- Ssh!
 Get off me!
 Close your eyes.
 No peeking.
 Go, go, go!
 Arggh!
 Hello?
 Oh! Tom!
 You shouldn't be out here
on your own, you know.
 There's a lot of worrying
types about.
 Is that supposed to be funny?
 I bought you a present.
 Did you miss me?
 You got away?
 I thought I was gonna be on my own.
 W-W...
 Where's Paddy?
 No!
 He saved me.
 Guys.
 I thought I told you to stay away.
 Food. Water.
 And I've seen something
that might lead us to Abby.
 "PSJ" on the side of the van.
 I know that.
 I know it.
 New antibiotics.
 Manufactured by
PSJ Pharmaceuticals.
 - And there's an address.
- OK, let's go get Abby.
 You're not going anywhere.
It's too dangerous.
 Naj, you're a liability.
 - And so are you, with a hole in your chest.
- What?
 He's right.
Your wound hasn't healed yet.
 If we run into trouble
and your stitches tear,
 you could be dying and I have nothing.
 No instruments, no pain relief, nothing.
 I can't go through that again,
even if you can.
 I didn't bring this on myself.
 But I almost died to save you.
 You owe it to me to stay alive.
 Take the Land Rover.
Najid and I will wait.
 - No!
- Don't.
 Abby came after me.
She wanted us to stick together.
 - We should split Tom's food.
- Tom isn't part of this.
 Well, we can spend all day
arguing about that
 or we can go and look for Abby.
 You all right?
 You seem a bit...
 I'm hungry, I'm cold and
I think I'm starting to smell.
 Which of those would you
like to talk about?
 Al.
 Yes?
 I don't want to argue.
 I just want to say...
be careful.
 Naj, I'm a coward.
 I'm always careful.
 I don't want anything to happen.
 I know.
 I know.
 Oh...
 - You are
- a pain in the arse...
 but you're not a liability.
 This is the address,
but where are the vans?
 It's here.
 "PSJ Customer Call Centre. 23rd floor."
 Do we even know what we're looking for?
 Anything that might help us find Abby.
 Haven't done booze,
drugs, junk food.
 Why am I so bloody unfit?
 You're not. You're weak because
you're undernourished. We all are.
 Are we starving?
 Not yet.
 Would we know?
 As long as we're still feeling
hunger and thirst
 then we're probably OK.
 Well, that's comforting.
 Sorry.
 Greg!
 No! No, please! Please, no!
 No! Please!
 Not again, please. Please.
 Water-purifying tablets.
 Won't always have time
to stop and boil it.
 - Even if it looks clean...
- How long will it take?
 - To purify the water?
- To find Abby.
 - I asked you a question.
- I know. I don't have an answer.
 You don't think they're
gonna find her.
 I didn't say that.
 Just cos you couldn't save her
doesn't mean no-one else can.
 Maybe you're right, Naj,
 maybe she's just playing a really
long game of hide-and-seek with us.
 Naj!
 Hey. Here you go.
 Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!
 Don't you touch me!
 - Stay away!
- Drop it!
 - Tom, no.
- I said drop it!
 Tom!
 Now get out.
 Wait!
 Take the knife! Take it!
 Don't leave it behind.
 You need it! You need it!
 You shouldn't have done that.
Now she's got nothing.
 She's always had nothing.
It's not rock, paper, scissors.
 Gun wins every time.
 I'll be back as soon as I can,
I promise.
 - Say bye-bye to Daddy.
- Bye-bye.
 Give me a kiss?
 Kisses with jam! My favourite.
 Just remember...
this isn't going to be forever.
 Look at you.
 You're covered in jam.
 Mummy!
 Mummy's here.
Mummy's here.
Mummy's here.
 What are we playing with?
 Oi!
 Wait. I'm not gonna hurt you.
 - You nearly busted my nose.
- You took my bag.
 Is it still bleeding?
 I don't know.
 - Here.
- Thanks.
 Who's Abby?
 I keep seeing her name everywhere.
What happened?
 She was taken.
There were these people.
 I would have stopped them,
but I wasn't there.
 - The ones in the black vans?
- You know about them?
 I... I know they take people.
 - Why? What for?
- I don't know.
 - Food?
- Shut up.
 - It could be.
- Shut up!
 What, then?
What do they take them for?
 - I don't know.
- Look, don't go.
 I'm sorry about trying
to take your stuff.
 We had food of our own,
but it got stolen.
 They wouldn't let me
go and look for her.
 But I'm the only one that really
thinks we'll find her.
 They're so scared,
aren't they, grown-ups,
 that something will happen to us...
 ...and then when something does happen,
it happens to them.
 I've got to go now.
 Oh.
 Oh, here.
Save you going into houses.
 Thanks.
 I could meet you here again,
if you like.
 Yeah? What about tomorrow?
 Yeah.
 - Bye.
- Bye.
 - Jarek.
- Lee?
 I know who's got our stuff.
 I've got something.
 PSJ Holdings...
manufacturing bases, administration...
 30 miles from here there's
an R&D; facility.
 - Maybe that's where they took Abby.
- What's R&D;?
 Research and development.
A lab.
 Not just any lab.
 A biosafety facility for research
into infectious diseases.
 Let's take a look.
 You'd think it would
be easier going down,
 but your legs are still
aching from climbing up.
 Good boy. Sleepy time.
 Only ten more floors to go.
 Whoa. Whoa.
 - Are you OK?
- Yeah. I'm fine.
 All right. Come on.
Let's get some air.
 - OK.
- Let's just breathe.
 You're all right, OK?
 We're just going to sit down
for a few minutes.
 Guys?
 You've got to be kidding me.
 You're the first person
I've seen in such a long time.
 I can't hear you.
 I shouldn't be here. I just wanted to...
 Please. They've injected me
with something. I'm so, so...
 I'm sorry. I don't know where...
 I don't work here.
 Did they take you too?
You've got to get out of here.
 I don't understand.
 - You have to run.
- I have to get back to my son.
 You have a son?
 You mustn't stay here with him.
They'll hurt you.
 They're working on a cure,
a vaccine.
 I'm the cure.
I'm the vaccine.
 I've been here for such a long time,
days and days and days and days.
 You came from outside?
 Is it true that the virus hasn't gone,
 that people are still dying?
 What people?
There are no people.
 Has the government lost control?
 There's no government.
 There's no anything.
 There's no-one left.
 No. No.
 That can't be right.
 I had a son too.
 No, don't go.
Please don't go.
 Please.
 Open the door, please!
 Someone please help us.
 How far are we really
going to get tonight?
 Maybe we should just,
you know, eat.
 What?
 We haven't even got the energy
to walk downstairs,
 so what if we have to fight?
 - Or what if we have to run?
- Yeah? What about Abby?
 Well, we're not going to be much
use to her like this, are we?
 Look at Anya.
She can hardly stand.
 - I'm all right. I'm just...
- Here.
 I'm all right.
 OK. Let's eat.
We'll spend the night here.
 I'll do that.
 I'm sorry I lost my temper.
 It's OK.
 I care about Abby too,
as much as you.
 But if we stay here,
sooner or later we die,
 and she wouldn't want that,
would she?
 So what do you do all day out there
on your own, anyway?
 Write Abby's name anywhere I can.
 If she sees a sign,
she'll know where to find us.
 That's brilliant thinking.
 Look, Naj, you're old enough
to know your own mind,
 so if you want to stay
behind and wait for Abby
 I won't stand in your way.
Just...
 don't get your hopes up.
 - You don't think they're gonna find her.
- They might.
 I hope so.
 But if they don't...
 We'll keep on looking...
 won't we?
 I've been worried about you.
 You don't have to.
I'm all right.
 Can I ask you something?
 Of course.
 What you said about a vaccine,
that you're getting closer...
 it is true, isn't it?
 I promise.
 How? How will you find it?
 We're developing
it synthetically in the lab.
 Everyone here's dedicated to finding a cure.
 But how will you know if it works?
 We'll test it.
 So you're not testing it now?
 - What makes you say that?
- Nothing. I just thought...
 Well, of course we're not testing it now.
How could we?
 You should rest more.
You look so tired.
 Who do you report to, James?
 Who's in charge of all this?
 I'm keeping the authorities up to date.
 Now, our work is very important to them.
 The authorities?
 You mean the government?
 Yes, of course.
 I couldn't do any of this
without you, Jill.
 You and Lucas...
 ...you're what it's all for.
 Let's get some rest.
 We'll go to the
research place in the morning.
 You never thanked me for your present.
 Thank you.
 What?
 Everywhere we go,
 that... pointing in someone's face
with your finger on the trigger.
 Well, someone's got to get
their hands dirty
 so people like you don't have to.
 Whenever I look at that,
all I see is blood and bones
 and tissue so ripped apart that
I can't tell what's meant to be where.
 And I'm the one expected to
put it all back together.
 I'm just trying to look after us.
 You think I use this for the fun of it?
 I don't know what you do, Tom.
 I don't know what you've done. I...
 I don't know anything about you.
 Well, you've obviously given it some thought.
 Come on, then. What is it?
What is it you want to know?
 What have I done?
 Everything.
 Everything that comes into my head.
 Sometimes I think you did it all.
 And?
 Does that make a difference?
 Sarah. Sarah, what are you doing?
 - I'll have it back before Tom's up.
- Have what back?
 - Don't touch me!
- All right.
 I'm sorry.
Just tell me where you're going.
 To see Johnson.
 What? The man with the
digging equipment? Why?
 Cos of what Anya said about this,
 how it'll rip someone apart
so you don't know what goes where any more.
 But that's how you got us out.
 He helped us. He helped save us.
 Yeah, and he made me pay.
 - I'm so sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry.
 - I want you to get out of my way.
- Don't do this!
 He said,
"We should do it again sometime."
 Like it was a date.
 As if me crying and trying
to get him off was normal.
 Are you saying he doesn't deserve this?
 Look, it doesn't matter if
he deserves this or not.
 You're not gonna get anywhere near him.
 You think he's gonna let you come up
next to him with that?
 I thought he'd be sleeping.
 If you do this, you will get hurt.
 I can still smell him on me.
 And we will get hurt
coming after you.
 - No-one would come after me.
- I would. I would.
 It'd be a bloody disaster.
 Now, please.
 I promised Najid
I would be careful.
 Can you do me a favour?
 OK. Just give me the gun first.
 You know, I really don't think
anyone's going to walk in on you,
 especially not to nick the water.
 It's my ration.
There's no rule that says
it has to be used for drinking.
 Did I say anything?
 Ohh!
 Oh, that must be really cold.
 Really, really cold.
 Sarah.
 You've got some soap, right...
 there.
 It's getting late.
I'll wake the others.
 How are you gonna drive?
 I'm not.
 If I'd have known it'd
be that much fun for you,
 I'd have got shot earlier.
 Stop. Stop.
 All right, stop.
Stop, stop.
 OK, er,
brake and clutch together.
 Otherwise it was good.
 Fire her up again
and I'll just make sure...
 Reverse into the bay, Najid.
 Round the back.
 There. Let's go. Go!
 Go, Najid!
 OK. Out. Come on!
 What about our stuff?
 There's too many of them to fight,
Najid. Come on!
 OK, OK.
 See it?
 I found it.
 Good. It means we're in the right place.
 But we've got it back.
We can go.
 We survived the sickness,
 but we will not survive men like that...
 predators, vampires.
 They will kill us all in the end.
 So we get them first.
 There!
 Shift! Go!
 Come on!
 I could drive if you're tired.
 Nah. I'm all right.
 Thanks for looking after me.
 Do we have what we need?
 Yes. Her blood's swimming
in antibodies.
 She is extraordinary.
 Death normally occurs 12 to 48 hours
after the first symptoms.
 She developed it less than ten hours ago
and she's already through the worst.
 It seems that the more often
she's exposed,
 the faster and more intense
the progression of the illness.
 Even if we never found a vaccine,
we could...
 we could make enough antiserum
to last for years
 just by infecting and reinfecting her.
 But her suffering would be unbearable.
 Perhaps it would be kinder if
we kept her in a permanent vegetative state
 no sentience, no sensation.
 Whatever this task demands of us,
we can't lose our humanity...
 ...or what's the point of it all?
 Is it true what you said...
that everyone's dead?
 Sorry.
 What was your son called?
 Peter.
 No, I'm sick.
You shouldn't be near me.
 I'll do my best to distract them.
 - What's your name?
- I'm Jill.
 Now run!
 Hey!
 Hello! Hello!
 This is it.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm so sorry.
 Hey! Hey!
 I'm Jill Whitaker.
I want to see my husband.
 I'm Jill Whitaker.
I want to see my husband.
 Move back now!
 I'm Jill Whitaker and I want to see...
 - Jill?
- James!
 How do we get in?
Do we just ram the gates?
 Well, there must be another entrance.
 Well, there's nothing.
This place is like a fortress.
 Over there!
 It's locked.
 - Ready?
- Go.
 There's nothing here.
 It's completely deserted.
 We're in the wrong place.
 The vans, the helicopter...
I want everyone out looking.
 Oh, Jill, what have you done?
 Find her.
 You lied to us.
 I had a mother.
 I had a brother.
You met him once.
 We might not always understand
why things must be the way they are.
 When it happened,
I called them.
 I told them to take
paracetamol and go to bed.
 We do what we must for the greater good.
 Quarantine,
until we know you're safe.
 How could you come home to me
and Lucas from this?
 How could you touch him?
 How could you kiss him?
 Because if I don't do this, who will?
 Who would be me, Jill,
given the choice?
 I wouldn't.
 Who do you report to, James?
 Who is it? Tell me the truth.
 All these questions now.
 You've only ever seen as much
as you wanted to see
 because you wanted to live.
 Now, if you'd known the truth,
 do you really think it would
have made any difference?
 Yes.
 Yes, yes, yes!
 Wait! What about Lucas?
 I have to be there when he wakes up.
He'll be frightened.
 I'll take care of him,
I promise.
 Lucas! Lucas!
 - Anything?
- Maybe they got out.
 No, he's still in there.
 We haven't seen him, though, have we?
Just the other two.
 What he did to us...
you think we're the only ones?
 You think he stops when he gets enough?
 His friends,
they eat what the jackal brings.
 Split up and find them.
 If we're quiet,
they won't know we're here.
 We can lock the door.
 Greg! Greg!
 I hit him.
 But I don't think he followed.
 Go on.
 In the nick of time as well.
Before.
 You teaching me how to drive,
respecting me,
 telling me I was old enough
to wait for Abby.
 Yeah, well, uh...
I lied about Abby.
 I wouldn't have let you stay.
 What were you gonna do?
Force me?
 Tie you up, knock you out,
put you in the back of the Land Rover.
 I couldn't stand to lose anyone else.
 I'm going to ask you a question...
 and if you make a sound
 other than to answer it,
I'll break your neck.
 Do you understand me?
 Huh.
 Why are you here?
Why won't you leave us alone?
 - Where's he hiding?
- Who?
 The guy with the gun.
The guy who robbed us.
 You had the food he took from us.
You had the stuff he stole!
 That's Price. Ugh!
 We didn't know he stole it.
 I swear.
I swear we didn't.
 Please. I'm not lying to you.
 Lee!
 Please. Somebody hurt him.
He can't fight, but I will.
 Aren't things horrible enough anyway?
 Please. I'm not lying to you.
You know I'm not.
 Lee!
 There's, er...
there's nothing here.
 You were right...
the bastard must have got away.
 Yeah, bastard must have got away.
 What's going on here, then?
 Naj!
 Oh!
 Hey!
 Oi! Leave him alone!
 Get off him!
 Stop kicking him!
 Move away from him
or I'll shoot.
 See?
Guns win every time.
 That food of Tom's, it was theirs.
He stole it.
 You didn't find Abby.
 You didn't find her!
 Whatever he stole from you,
you take it and you leave.
 Where are you going?
 I need to find Abby.
 They're gonna leave the city,
but I know she'll come back here.
 You could stay with us...
if you want.
 I need to make them do the right thing.
 I should go.
 Sorry about your nose.
 Lee, come on.
 Now get out.
 No. What did you think he was going to do
in the city on his own?
 What did any of us think?
 There are rules.
 Either he lives by them or he goes.
 I can do rules.
 From now on,
get this out of my sight or I go.
 No cartridges.
 - Where's Najid?
- Where is he?
 Naj!
 What will you do, James?
 We found her once.
We'll find her again.
 I'm sure you will.
We both know what's at stake.
 Our way of life is not sustainable for ever.
 So far, we've been fortunate...
fortunate and diligent.
 We've kept the virus at bay.
 But one mistake and everything
we've worked for is lost.
 Find Abby Grant, James,
and do it soon.
 Are you married, Mr Landry?
 Our private lives are not important, James.
 You know that.
 You promised me a vaccine.
Don't let me down.
 Oh, God.
 Naj!
 He must be here somewhere.
 Oh, God.
 Najid!
 You didn't find Abby!
 I told you,
I told you and I told you,
 but you didn't listen.
 I'm not leaving without her.
 All right, just come on down
and we will talk about it.
 No. Greg's going to tie me up
and throw me in the Land Rover.
 Don't be silly, Naj.
 Come on. I can't believe anyone thought
it might come to that.
 All right, but I wouldn't
have told him, would I?
 - Najid!
- Naj!
 I'm not listening!
 Naj, come on!
You can't stay up there all night.
 I'm here!
 Abby, up here!
 Abby!
 You have to help me!
You have to hide me!
 Hey, it's OK, it's OK.
You're safe now. You're home.
 No, I'll...
I'll never be safe.
 They'll never stop looking.
 - Get moving!
- Tom's gone.
 They've taken him to Samantha's
to put him on trial.
 Violence is unnecessary.
 You blinked.
 Why don't you defend him?
 - What were you in prison for?
- Rape?
 - Past crimes don't count.
- Murder?
 - Let him go!
- Drop it.
