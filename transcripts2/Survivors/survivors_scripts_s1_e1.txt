 Survivors (2008â€“2010): Season 1, Episode 1 - Episode #1.1 - full transcript 
 A mysterious virus kills most of the world. In England Abby Grant finds herself immune but her husband dead. She determines to set out and find her son Peter, last known holidaying in the Peak District,and on the motorway meets the practical Greg Preston. Tom Price, a convict serving life for murder, kills the only other prison survivor, a warder,and escapes, meeting Anya, a hospital doctor who has seen friends and patients alike die. Al, a wealthy young man, also survives, 'adopting' Najid, an eleven year old orphan. The group ultimately come together whilst Samantha Willis, the only government minister to survive, forms a small caucus in a germ-free complex, killing anyone who may be infected to tries to get in but having to admit the thuggish Dexter as her right hand man.

 Welcome to Manchester Airport. In the interests of security... It's a message from Peter. He went white-water rafting this morning and his canoe capsized. He had to be rescued! - What are you doing? - I'm calling him. He's all right, isn't he? What if he's cut himself on a rock or something? It could get infected. Abby, you promised you wouldn't make a fuss. We'll call him this evening, like we said, OK? A virulent flu virus is sweeping Britain, leaving medical services struggling to meet demands for vaccinations.

 Tell us about Cyprus, then. Was it dead romantic? Sexy as hell. Abby spent most of the time in the hotel texting Peter. I was worried about him. It's only been a few months. But he's all right now, isn't he? He looks really well. He's in total remission. 100% well. He's a normal, healthy little boy. Yeah, but we'll always have to be careful. That doesn't mean we treat him like an invalid. I'm sick of talking about leukaemia. It's mad. This bloody flu business. Half the country's off sick. We should have taken Peter for a jab before he went.

 - He'll be fine up where he is. - Miles away from anywhere. Best place to be. Drink plenty of fluids and avoid contacting a health professional except in an emergency. Mummy's ill. - A lot of people are ill. - You're not. Neither are you. We're lucky, aren't we? Daddy! Sorry. I couldn't get a bus. - You're hot! - I've been running, sweetheart. I've got to get back. Her mum's in bed. There's no school tomorrow. We think it best if the children stay at home for a few days. You say bye. - Are you all right, Mrs Sturges? - I'm fine, Jenny. Just haven't eaten all day. I should go. My flatmate wasn't feeling too bright this morning. I'll email you as soon as we get the all clear. You can't just lock us up like this. It's a breach of our human rights. So, call a lawyer. All right, Tom? Weird stuff this, in't it? Locked up all day in a cell with you? Yeah, it's a nightmare. - Nelson Mandela had it easy. - Hear most of the screws are off sick. It's a flu epidemic. Don't you read the papers? There's this rumour about early release for who's got less than two to go. There ain't enough screws to keep the prison open. Do you actually believe that? Well, I was just saying. Well, don't. You're embarrassing yourself. We need to get a press statement out as soon as possible. Tell the media I'm taking personal responsibility for the flu crisis. And don't call it a crisis. Downplay the infection rate, concentrate on the good news. Health professionals doing a magnificent job, people pulling together to beat the bug, that type of thing. I'm arranging photo calls for you. If we hurry we can get a shot of you having the flu jab - on the Six O'Clock News. - Good. The PM wants me to be as visible as possible. He's keen to show we're being proactive. - How is he? - Bad tempered. I was really hoping to get away this weekend. That's not going to happen. We're getting more cases by the hour. Jack's going to kill me. He's booked a hotel. You couldn't phone him for me, could you, Mark? He won't shout at you. 2 DAYS LATER The European flu continues to spread throughout the UK. Today, government agencies are issuing warnings of serious disruptions to all domestic utilities due to high levels of absenteeism caused by sickness. Peter? It's Mum. Are you OK? You're all fit and well up there? I love you too, honey. Hello? I can't stay long. I've got to get Frank to the doctors. Has he got this bug? Of course it's worse for him than anyone else. You know what men are like. It's the old folks you worry about. It always hits them hardest. Thanks. Listen, Helen, I was wondering about coming back to work. I know it's been a while but... - How is your Peter now? - He's fine. He's absolutely fine. I never wanted you to go. Not many of my girls handled the salesmen so well. They all ask for you. That's cause they were all trying to get into my knickers. You know what they're like. - You're sure you're ready to come back? - Absolutely. I'll put in a word. Do you think she's all right? She ought to be home in bed, poor love. The European flu crisis deepened today with much of the UK's population now affected by the virulent strain. The effects of the epidemic wreaked havoc on Britain's transport network today, and there are further... Three hours for a 20-minute journey. It's crazy. The whole country's grinding to a halt. Have you heard from Peter? I spoke to him earlier and he sounded a bit strange. Strange, how? I don't know, like, he didn't want to talk. Well, maybe he wanted to go out and play. - What? - The job? Yeah! It went well. - Helen thinks she can swing it. - That's great. Look, don't be angry with me, but I, I think something was wrong with him. OK, I'll stop worrying. I'm going up for a bath. I'll get you a drink. Sounds wonderful. In a statement, the Prime Minister said everything possible was being done to confront the emergency. The State of Emergency is still being discussed in Cabinet. You mean by any minister left standing. The PM is reluctant to put troops on the streets. - He feels that should be a last resort. - What stage does he think we're at now? - I have to give the media more. - The problems are unprecedented. There hasn't been an outbreak of this severity since 1918. That kind of thing. Can I at least announce that the army is on stand-by? What is this? It came from the Chief Medical Officer's people a few moments ago, strictly confidential. I'm trying to get clarification. "The impact of the virus is more severe than early tests indicated." - What does that mean? - No one seems to know. They said the implications are very serious. When was this? You should have phoned us. You know his medical history. What is it? We'll be there as soon as we can. It's nothing serious. He's just a bit unwell. I knew something was wrong. We have to get him to hospital. It's not the cancer. It's flu. How do they know that? He shouldn't even be there. - Should have brought him home. - Doesn't matter where he is. He'd still have caught it. Why did I ever listen to you? Why was I so stupid? I'm sorry. - Bloody hell. You're on fire. - I'm fine. Let's just go. - We'll never make it all the way there. - We can get petrol somewhere else. - Sorry, it's urgent. - I've been waiting half an hour. It's my son, he's ill. Yeah, who isn't? Get in line, and wait like everyone else. You're bloody queue-jumping, mate! - I was here first. - Just leave it. You bloody idiot, what's wrong with ya? What's wrong? It feels like my head's gonna explode. Why didn't you say something? Let's just get Peter. Let's get you home, get you a doctor. Then I'll come back for Peter, OK? Come on. I don't feel good. I'm bloody hot. My arm, it really hurts. We need help in here! What do you want, Price? - Coyne's sick. - Everyone's sick. - He needs a doctor. - There is no doctor. He went down with it this morning. There's nothing I can do. You can't just leave me in here with him. I'll catch it as well. Upstairs? All right, Charlie. Champagne? Cristal. - What's your name? - Simone. That's a cute name. I'm Al. The first official cases of European Flu have been reported in Washington and Beijing. We're getting reports of localised power outages the Tube system is virtually at a standstill. - Picture's the same over the country. - What are we doing? People don't expect the national infrastructure to collapse. None of our contingency plans allowed for it spreading so quickly. We have to isolate infected people. Quarantine them if necessary. - It's already too late for that. - What do you mean? Virtually the entire population has already been exposed. The virus is much more aggressive than early tests indicated. By the time symptoms begin to show, the body's immune system has already been severely compromised. Compromised? It goes into meltdown. In effect, the body's attacking itself. - You stay away from me. - For God's sake, man, help me! I need someone in here, now! Will you stop staring at me? I'm doing the best I can. What's going on? It must be a power cut. There are candles in the hall cupboard. I've got a lump under my arm. - What are you doing? - Calling the doctor. Come on. No, just leave me. I just need to lie down. Look, we're gonna have to drive you there. Just try for me. I just need to go to sleep. Here you go, Pat. Try and get this down you, it will make you feel better. Please, Jen, just get Anya. She'll know what to do. I've called the hospital, sweetheart. They said she'd get back to us when she could. Please. Are you all right? - You're gonna have to walk. - I'm scared. Please. It's not that far. Come on. Just a bit further. Come on. Just stay here. Excuse me. Can you page Dr Anya Raczynski for me, please? Tell her it's Jenny. Dr Anya Raczynski, please come to reception immed... Emergency services are doing extremely well. Fresh vaccines are being distributed and the we have opened up a record number of hospital beds. How can you say that when you know that hospitals all over the country are closing their doors? Nobody denies the seriousness of the situation, but we are confident we're handling it well. It's true that the government has lost control? We're a very long way from that situation. I didn't know what else to do. Come with me. In here. Give me a minute. - You're not allowed in there. - How many? Hundreds. In the last few hours alone. It's the same everywhere. The virus... causes our own immune systems to turn against us. It rips our natural defences to shreds. Some people can fight it for longer. But in others... it moves so quickly. What about the jab? Useless. Fiction to keep the panic under control. It takes years to develop effective vaccines. We've had days. Pat? I can't help her. Is there a vaccine yet? Our immediate hope lies in prevention. My advice to the public is to stay home and avoid contact with each other as much as possible. Minister, we are getting credible reports that people are dying. I think we have to treat internet speculation with a degree of suspicion at this point. Is it true that the Prime Minister himself is ill? I briefed him a few hours ago and he was fine. Then why won't he talk to us? He's coordinating the Government's response. I'm sure you wouldn't expect anything less. I'd like to invite General Mike Stone to explain the practical aspects of the State of Emergency. Thank you, Minister. The Army's first priority will be the maintenance of essential services... Not bad. You're dropping. Yeah, it's the dancing. I need a shower. Through there. Drink? Yeah, vodka. So you must be pretty rich. You know, not compared to some. You should see my uncle's place in New York. What are you? Saudi? My dad is Kuwaiti, Mum's English. Al doesn't sound like an Arab name. Well, it's short for Aalim. Al's easier. There's nothing to be gained from rumours and hearsay. The hard information suggests the emergency services are coping extremely well. Keep up, Najid. We must stick together. We must pray to be spared from this terrible sickness. There's nothing to be scared of. If anything happens, if somehow you find yourself alone, tell the authorities you have cousins in Blackburn. You can't go to sleep with your hair wet. You'll catch your death. There must be some hope. There are bound to be some people who are naturally immune. The lucky ones. If you can call them that. Why shouldn't you? Can you... imagine what their lives will be like now? How scared and lonely they'll be? But... whatever happens, I'd rather live. Perhaps you will. If you stay well for another few days. Jen? My head hurts and I'm... I'm too hot. And there's a lump. I was having such a strange dream. Well, you're awake now. Does it hurt anywhere? It feels like I'm floating. It's quite nice. - I can't breathe. - It's OK. - No, I'm too hot. - Try to relax. It's OK. I'm so scared. Abby, don't do this... For years, medical experts have predicted a global flu pandemic, but even they are surprised by the speed and scale of the outbreak. This is it? This is what I'm supposed to tell them? I think that's up to you now. The Prime Minister died a few minutes ago. How many millions? If the infection carries on progressing at the current rate, we're talking more than 90% of the world's population. Tell everyone to go home as soon as the press conference is finished. They should be with their families now. You too. Of course, Jack. She's right here. - Thank you. - Better hurry, I don't think the mobile networks will last much longer. Thank you, Mark. You've done a remarkable job. It's been a privilege working with you, Minister. Sorry I couldn't call earlier, it's just... All of you? The boys too? Are they in bed? Good. No, I'm fine. I'll be home soon. Of course everything's going to be all right. It's just a nasty bug. I love you. I can no longer disguise from you the fact that we are facing a very grave crisis. During this period of uncertainty it is possible there will be temporary losses of power and water. I urge you all to behave responsibly, to be good neighbours and to avoid panic. As soon as is practically possible, your government will restore services and normalise the situation. Rest assured we continue to work on your behalf. In the meantime, good luck, and God bless you all. Come on, darling, time to make a move. Dad? Wake up. What have you done? You stupid cow, what have you taken? Mum! Mate. What's going on? What the hell? In here! There was nothing I could do. You're not even ill. You know how many people are still OK in this place? None of them. Not one. They're all either dead or dying. What's funny? We're sill here, Mr. Wilson. You and me. So... what happens now? You can't just leave me in here. I was going to leave you to die. But I'm not an animal, like you. Keep where I can see you. Did you lose anyone, Mr Wilson? Wife and two kids. Died within an hour of each other. - Sorry to hear that. - I don't want your sympathy. - You gotta be joking, haven't ya? - Someone will come for you. I'm not going in there. You're a prisoner of Her Majesty's Government. You'll do what you're bloody told. You've got 20 years left to serve, Price. And no matter what happens, I intend to see you do every last one of them. Now get in. You don't have to do this. What are you talking about? You can turn a blind eye while I walk the other way. Nothing's the same now. Old rules don't apply, do they? Get in there. I'm giving you a chance. Let me go and I'll disappear. You and I will never bump into each other again. Now that is what I call ironic. You survive the plague and you get killed over something silly like this. I offered you a fair deal. You should have taken it. 3 DAYS LATER David? Joe! Joe, Linda! Please, someone help me! Please! Help! Please, God, don't let me be the only one. I have to find Peter now. I'll look after him, I promise. PETER, I CAN'T STAY HERE WHEREVER YOU ARE, I'LL FIND YOU - MUM - What the hell are you doing? - I didn't know anyone was there. I could have crashed the car. Do you know how much this thing cost? 90 grand. You do not play football in the road. Didn't your parents teach you anything? Sorry. Where are you to going to, anyway? Blackburn, to find my cousins. My family are all dead. I'm sorry. I better get going. I'd give you a lift, but I'm heading south. I'm not allowed to accept lifts from strange men. Fair enough. You'll be fine. In a few days, everything will be back to normal. - You reckon? - Yeah, probably. I'd take you with me, but it's complicated. I wasn't asking. I wouldn't know how to look after a little boy, I'm not really the... parental type. I'm not little. I'm 11. Right. Get in. I told you. I don't need looking after. Just bloody get in. No funny stuff, OK? - What? - You're not a pedophile, are you? No, I'm not! Now get in the car! So, you got your cousins' address? Well, I can't drive round Blackburn on the off-chance, can I? All right, look, there must be someone still in charge. We'll find them and then they'll sort you out. All right? Hello? Peter? It's OK. I didn't mean to frighten you. I should have said something, sorry. - Have you had the illness? - It never touched me. - Have you? - I recovered. I'm Callum Brown, I'm one of the instructors here. Well, I was. Don't take this the wrong way, Mr Brown, but I think you might be the most beautiful man I've ever seen! Peter was one of the first boys who fell ill. Of course, at that point, we didn't know what was coming. I spoke to him in the morning. I knew something was wrong. In the end, Phil Emerson decided to drive him down to the hospital and I stayed behind here with the other kids. But he was still alive when they left? He was very sick, Mrs Grant. And no-one else has recovered. - But I did! - You're the only one. But you don't know. You don't know for certain that he's dead. No, I don't. I have to go. He could be out there right now. I've got to get to that hospital. - You can't drive now. You're exhausted. - I'm fine. No, it's too dangerous at night now. There are no lights. Stay tonight, rest. Mum? I'm home. That's Phil Emerson with Peter. Take it. So, what will you do now? Well, I'll have to bury the boys now. And then, I'll climb in the Peaks, walk a little. Life won't be so very different. Not many of us can say that. That way of life is gone now. Mobile phones, computers, the electricity that powers them. All gone for good. - We'll soon get things working again. - Do you think so? When was the last time you did anything truly practical, Mrs Grant? - Like what? - Like milked a cow, or slaughtered a pig, or, you know, grew a vegetable. I mean, do you know what mushrooms are OK to eat and which ones will kill you? That's the kind of knowledge you're going to need now. We still have books. We can learn what we need from them. Well, we're gonna need to. And soon. There must be millions of tonnes of preserved food left, a huge stockpile of things. Cars, clothes, petrol... Yeah, but how long d'you think that's going to last? We'll have to start all over again, relearn the skills we've forgotten. We've become like helpless babies, pushing the buttons of our fancy technology whilst distancing ourselves further every day from the reality of what it actually is to be human. Perhaps I have more faith in people than you do. We can save ourselves, all right. But the work starts now. And mobile phones won't help. Well, I'm going to hang on to mine for now. Just in case. Hi. Where are you headed? I don't know. Just out of here. I'm Neil. This is Cathy. She don't say much. I just found her in the kids' playground, sitting on a swing. Pleased to meet you. I'm Tom. We're just looking for somewhere to live. - Well, take your pick. - Not round here. Too many bodies. It creeps me out. It's all wide open now, isn't it? - What is? - The future. We can make it whatever we want. Did you lose anyone? My parents. You? Wife, two kids. All within an hour of each other. Mate, you're welcome to join us, if you want. Why not? Great. You can share the driving. - Sling your bag in the back. - I'll keep hold of this. Suit yourself. God! What happened? You were drunk. You fell asleep. I'm hungry. We'll stop at a shop. I need to pray first. - What? - Which way's east? How do I know? You're a Muslim, aren't you? That's north. East is that way. You should be praying. You still believe in God after all of this? Of course I do. Well, he hasn't done much for you lately, has he? My dad says that God always knows what he's doing. Yeah? Well, if he does, he's keeping it to himself. Hurry up. You ran out of petrol, remember? Where are we going? To get some petrol. Where from? Where do you think? They don't just keep it lying around in cans, you know. We need to get another car. I don't want another car, I want my car. My dad would know what to do. Well, I'm not your dad, am I? All right, we'll find another car, but it better be a decent one. I'm hungry. Hello? Hi, Mum. We went white water rafting today. I fell out and hit my head on this massive rock. It was so cool. I'm loving it, so don't worry about anything. See you soon, Mum. Love ya. What are you doing? - You could have killed us both! - I'm sorry! Of all the terrible pieces of driving... - Is your car badly damaged? - It's OK. How was I supposed to know you were there? I had right of way. You do know how to drive, don't you? Fine. It was my fault. Would you like my insurance details? Is that supposed to be funny? Well, I thought so. - Here you go. - Thank you. I never really appreciated how wonderful tea is before. That milk won't last long. I'll have to get hold of a cow before long. Or a goat. Is that what you're going to do? - Find a farm? - Something like that. A small place where I can grow a few things, keep a few animals. You make it sound quite nice. It won't be. It'll be hard work. Maybe you'll find other people to help. I don't need other people. How about you? I was looking for my son. But now, I don't know what to do. Well, you can't stay in the city. It's too dangerous. I've had the virus. I'm talking about cholera, typhoid, all the diseases that come with millions of unburied bodies. Those places will be hell. Better get moving. You on a tight schedule, then? You have to live, you know? You owe it to the people you loved to keep going. That's what they would have wanted. If I recovered, maybe my son did too. He could be out there somewhere. All the more reason to keep yourself fit and healthy. That way, if you find him, you can make a fresh start. You really think he might be alive? Miracles happen. Even now. You can travel with me for a while, if you want. Obviously, you're not safe driving yourself, so... I'm actually a very good driver. I noticed. I'd like that. Just for now, though, cos I've got plans of my own. - Greg Preston. - Abby Grant. I'll get my stuff. There's such a lot. Are you sure we can afford all this, Neil? Course we can. Just grab a couple more bits, all right? I've got that. You look nice in that dress. It suits you. You've got good legs. Can you hear what I'm saying to you? Good. I was beginning to think you were a bit simple. I know everything seems really bad at the moment, but you're gonna be OK. We've all just got to look after each other. All right? She just started screaming. Could be something useful. And there's always a bloody queue! What the hell's he playing at? Hi. Where have you come from? Have you met anyone else? Back off! This is my petrol. What d'you mean? We're not going to take it. I was here first. - You don't understand... - Get lost! - We don't want your petrol! - Why are you being like this? - Get away! - What are you doing, you idiot? Welcome to the new world. I'm starving. See what you can find for us, love. I put the biscuits down somewhere. Put that back! Leave her alone! Just drive, and we'll pretend this didn't happen. Don't try to move. Just breathe for me, try to relax. You'll live. You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you. So I'm told. You've cracked a couple of ribs, but as far as I can tell, there are no internal injuries. What happened? I was mugged. Why would anyone mug you? They gave me a lift, jumped me and then nicked all my gear. Are you a doctor? I'm nothing anymore. There's loads of stuff here. You can't live on crisps. You need fruit, veg, stuff like that. We can hang out here for a while, then go to Blackburn to find my cousins. You know they're probably dead? We're not. Good point. And it's not like you've got any brilliant ideas, is it? I got ideas, don't you worry. What are they? None of your business. And I'm not going to bloody Blackburn. I'm going to go over to the Travel Inn and get us some blankets. You stay here. There might be some dead bodies. I've seen bodies. Loads of them. Then you don't need to see any more, do you? I'm going down the road to see if anyone's coming. Don't get run over. - What's wrong with him? - He had an accident. I can't move him on my own. We can't leave him in this condition. You're welcome to travel with us, until the two of you find somewhere to stay. We're not together. Come on. You'll be OK. What did I tell you about playing football in the road? Come on, then, big boy! Stay close. Hello. Hi. It's so good to see you. I don't know you, do I? There are so few of us left, every new person feels like a gift. Where are you headed? I thought I'd check out what's happening in London. I wouldn't if I were you. You think it's bad back there... If someone is still in control, we'd know by now. There's gotta be something left. Yeah, just a few people like us. - So what do we do? - That's up to you. - It's the end of the line for me. - What do you mean? I've got things to do. You'll be OK now. - You're just gonna walk away? - I told you. I'm going to try and find a place of my own. Me too. I might as well push off as well. I can't play nanny for much longer. I didn't want you lurking around me, anyway. Are you all completely crazy? - You can't just go! - Why not? Because we've only just found each other. We don't know each other. We've got nothing in common. We survived! Isn't that something? You told me I had to make a fresh start. Well, how can any of us do that on our own? I also told you that I have plans. They can bloody well wait! This is more important. Everything we ever knew has been ripped away from us. Our old life is dead. Now we have to build a new one. And we can't do it alone. There is only one choice. We stand together or die. I'm going where she's going. I'm in. What else have we got going for us? I've got to find my cousins. But I don't mind hanging around for a while. Why not? All right. Just till you get yourselves settled, then I'm away. OK, boss. What do we do now? ...to behave responsibly, to be good neighbours and to avoid panic. As soon as it is practically possible, your government will restore services and normalise the situation. Rest assured, we continue to work on your behalf. In the meantime, good luck. I'm sorry, Sammy. I didn't hear you. Everyone waiting? It's quite all right. There's no rush. Who did you have on the outside? My parents, and my sister. I'm sorry. We've all had to sacrifice so much. You never told them anything? That must have been hard. Well, Sammy. I think it's time to begin. From now on, we go out foraging every day. Treat it like a job. LOOTER Doing a bit of shopping? People have to know this place belongs to us and respect our property. Stay away. I'm so lonely, Greg. I owe you one. You! Get out of the car! I told you to stay away. Get down on the ground. - Why did you come back? - I told you. I was looking for someone. Life...
