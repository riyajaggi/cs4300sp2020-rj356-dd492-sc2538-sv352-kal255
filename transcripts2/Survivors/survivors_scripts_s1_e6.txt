 Survivors (2008â€“2010): Season 1, Episode 6 - Episode #1.6 - full transcript 
 The group is forced to leave their country house headquarters when Sarah betrays the fact that Anya is a doctor and Tom kills one of Samantha's men. They relocate to the city where Naj gets lost and is eventually found,having been taken in by Craig, a sort of Fagin figure who, with his partner June, gives boys a home in exchange for what they can scavenge. The other survivors take Naj from Craig but are ultimately tracked down by Samantha's people in a rooftop car park where Greg is shot and Abby is captured and driven away.

 We'll find them one day. I promise.
 You should have come clean
about your criminal record.
 What I did is done.
 You're in the Government.
 I am the Government.
What's left of it.
 She can't smell it but I can.
What?
 Prison.
 What I'm building here
is SO precarious.
 If it fails, there'll be nothing.
 I saved your life.
 I gave you what you wanted.
That makes us quits.
 What are you doing? Sarah!
 I got the virus.
I wasn't immune.
 I told you to stay away
from my stuff.
 Why did you come back?
 I told you -
I was looking for someone.
 The world's a bad place, Abby.
Always was.
 Now there's no civilisation left.
 There's no protection.
 We're seeing each other for what
we really are and it's not pretty.
 Get up.
 What is it?
 Greg!
 Lovely morning.
 Just keep away from here.
 Temper, temper!
 What do you want?
 The names and former occupations
of everyone living in this house.
 You've got about five seconds.
 Dexter, put the gun down.
 Hello, Abby.
 Under the terms of
the provisional constitution,
 all survivors must provide
personal details
 when requested to do so by a member
of the National Government.
 What the hell are you on about?
 You get him away from me.
 Just...just give her some space.
 OK.
 There's nothing to be frightened of.
I just want to talk to you.
 Abby...
 This is a lovely place.
 How dare you bring that man
to this house?
 What do you want?
Please just hear me out.
 We're making progress now, Abby.
Real progress.
 People are joining us all the time.
 More than we can accommodate
in the main compound.
 For the first time since the virus,
we can start planning for the future.
 Well, I'm very happy for you.
 You're missing the point.
 Now that our numbers are growing, we
can move towards our ultimate goal -
 the restoration of full government.
 What's going on?
 Cup of tea would be nice, love.
 No problem.
 I'm more of a coffee man, myself.
 House by house, village by village,
 we're going to rescue this country
from anarchy and disorder.
 Of course, it will take time.
 A generation, perhaps.
 But the work starts now,
and...I want you to be a part of it.
 I'm going to feed the chickens.
 Naj.
 Oi, oi! Where you going?
Get off me!
 Hey, get off him.
He says he's got some work to do.
 - I don't think he's got a job yet.
- Leave him alone!
 No!
 Are you all right?
 Why can't you people just go away?
 What's going on?
 Right. Outside, now.
 Look, I'm...
Don't bother.
 We have a choice now, Abby.
 We can descend into savagery
or we can...begin our recovery.
 How can you say that
when you're holding us at gunpoint?
 The guns are purely for security.
No-one is threatening you.
 Now, Dexter shouldn't have
come into the house.
 I apologise.
That man is a thug and a murderer.
 Don't you think I know that?
He was a threat to us all.
 That's why I had to make
an accommodation with him.
 You should be thanking me!
I'm going to feed the chickens.
 Go to your room, Naj.
Why?
 Just do as I say.
 Oi, loser!
 Move it.
 Just say what you have to say
and then go.
 There's no future
in living hand-to-mouth.
 If we're going to survive
in the long-term,
 we have to distribute
our remaining food
 equally and fairly
among all survivors.
 Surely you agree with that, Abby?
 I told you before,
you're not the government.
 You barely can control the streets,
let alone this country.
 We have to start somewhere.
 The immediate area
 and then the rest of the county.
 We can build up a complete picture
of our resources
 and record the personal details
of everyone we find.
 It'll be like a new Domesday Book.
 We have to look after each other now.
 That's why I need to know
what you did before the virus.
 professionals in every area,
 but the unskilled
will be given jobs too.
 Everyone can dig a ditch
or plant a seed.
 Sounds like forced labour.
It's only common sense.
 We have to rebuild our society.
 I know this transitional phase
will be difficult.
 But in the long run,
it will be worth it.
 Forgive me. I have a number
of other places to visit today.
 Please give your details to Dexter
and we'll be in touch.
 Why can't you just leave us alone
to live our own way?
 Because it won't work.
 This first generation of survivors
has only one task.
 To provide a stable future
for our children.
 Now, if that means
sacrificing our comfort,
 even our freedom, then
it's a price I'm prepared to pay.
 Except it won't be you,
Samantha, will it?
 It'll be all the rest of us.
 This isn't about you and me.
 It's about the kind of world
your son will inherit.
 Don't you dare
bring my son into this.
 I intend to devote the rest of
my life to building a decent society
 for every...
lost and lonely child out there.
 But not like this.
 Not by force.
 What are you going to do about Najid?
 He needs an education, security.
 I can promise him all those things.
 Can you?
 Name and occupation.
 Come on. Hurry up.
 Good girl.
 Is this it?
 Will you stop bloody coughing?
 He's not well, Craig.
All day and all bloody night.
 I'll get you some cough syrup,
Darren, OK?
 All right, 20 minutes each.
 Tania goes first.
 She did very well today.
 Darren, not you.
 You think you deserve games
for this?
 You know the rules.
 Everyone pays their way.
 Tom Price. Army.
 Prison record?
 What was your offence?
 How long did you serve?
 You said name and occupation.
That's all.
 Anya Raczynski.
 I was a...student
of...archaeology.
 That's not much bloody use.
 Sarah Boyer. I...
 Hello, Sarah.
 Got a little surprise for you.
 Aren't you gonna
say something, Sarah?
 It's a good job
we found those antibiotics,
 the ones that you put
where Bob couldn't reach 'em.
 You told me he died.
 I didn't know. I thought he had.
 Bob's lucky to be alive,
and he needs constant nursing.
 We think you should share the burden.
You're coming back with us.
 But I couldn't.
 It isn't my idea. If I never saw
your face again, it'd be too soon.
 He raped me!
That's a lie.
 You used me and then
you left me to die like a dog.
 I expect you'll need
a bit of time to pack.
 Get him out of here
before he wets himself again.
 No, you don't.
 She's not going anywhere.
 Get back!
 Whoa! Whoa!
 Get back.
 You get back.
 Get her out of here.
 Is he all right?
 Tom, Tom.
 Please. I can't do this.
 I hate him.
Bob's all right.
 Nice bloke
when you get to know him.
 And after a while
you'll get used to wiping his bum.
 Look, you don't want me.
 Bob needs someone
who can look after him properly.
 Look after all of you.
 Don't touch me.
 You can't just take her!
She's not a prisoner!
 She's a doctor. She belongs
 She lied to a government official.
That's an offence.
 There'll be an inquiry. Take her
back. I'm gonna join Samantha.
 I'm sorry. I didn't
want to leave you. I love you.
 Please.
 I just thought you'd
like me more if she wasn't here.
 Go. You look a mess.
 Why don't you just admit
that you're in love with her?
 Look, I'll go after Samantha.
I'll make her see reason.
 They're not gonna let her
just walk away.
 You coming?
 They've got about 10 minutes on us.
 Dexter's gone with Samantha.
 They're armed.
 Can't be helped.
 I'll drive.
 What's going on?
 I'll explain later.
Pack a bag. We're leaving.
 No.
 Just do as I say, Naj. Please!
 We've missed them.
 They wouldn't be here yet
if they took the main road.
 Hey.
 Drop it!
 Did they hurt you?
 I'm fine.
 Get her in the car and take her
back.
 Al, you go. I'll stay with you.
 It's OK.
 T-Tom, what are you gonna do?
 Just get going.
 You know Samantha's not gonna
let this slide.
 Let us go. And I'll
put a good word in for you.
 I'm giving you a chance.
 Where are you going?
 Come here.
 Come here.
 You tell Willis that I'll
kill anyone who comes after us.
 We make our own law now.
 OK?
 Are you OK?
Yep.
 Where's Tom?
 He's just behind us.
 OK. Well, we better get going.
 Where to?
 As far away from Samantha
as possible.
 Scotland?
Too bloody cold!
 All right. Um, south coast.
 Devon, Dorset. As long as
we keep away from the cities.
 Why do we have to go? Can't we just
say sorry and she'll leave us alone?
 It's complicated, Naj.
I know. I'm not stupid.
 This isn't the time.
 We can't move
from place to place forever.
 What about the chickens?
We can't leave them here.
 The foxes will kill them.
 We have to travel light, Naj.
 We'll find more chickens
once we're settled, OK?
 No. I don't want to go.
I like my room.
 Go get your stuff.
You can't tell me what to do.
 You're not my mum.
Just bloody grow up!
 Are you OK?
 Yeah, I'm fine.
 What happened?
 There was a dispute.
 Got out of hand.
 Gavin's dead.
 Tell me you had no choice.
 I had no choice.
 All we're doing
is defending ourselves, Abby.
 Is it true what they said?
 That you were in prison?
 Yeah.
 Don't you want to know why?
 No.
 It doesn't matter.
 Not now.
 Just tell me whatever it was
 is in the past.
 It's in the past, Abby.
 I got the virus. I wasn't immune.
 Most of the naturally immune
experience few, if any, symptoms
 but Abby Grant nearly died.
 That makes her unique.
 Now, even though the virus
threw her immune system into chaos,
 it carried on killing
the infected cells.
 It was a close thing
but her body won.
 Why her?
 It happens.
 Millions of people can die
but one survives.
 And that one freak of nature
is the key to our vaccine.
 We have to bleed her and study
her antibodies as soon as possible.
 She's a human being, not a lab rat.
 I appreciate that.
 We've been over this, Sami.
 I did what was necessary.
 I take full responsibility.
 You slaughtered an innocent woman
for no good reason.
 She was our only hope.
 What's one life weighed against
the survival of the human race?
 I want guarantees.
 If we find Abby Grant,
she won't be harmed.
 Of course.
 You have my word on it.
 What?
 You could have let them take me
but you didn't.
 Thank you.
 Are you coming with us?
 If that's all right.
 Where's Naj?
 AL: Sulking in his room.
Still upset about the chickens.
 Oh, for God's sake,
let's just take the chickens.
 There's no room!
We'll leave something else behind.
 Good. I'll tell him.
 Hey! Stop!
 Stop! I'm down here!
 Help! Stop!
 He's gone.
 He's gone where?
What?!
 AL: The note says he's gone home.
 Why would he go home? I mean,
he knows all his family are dead.
 Doesn't he know
what the city's gonna be like now?
 He's always going on about
his cousins in Blackburn.
 Maybe he thinks
they're trying to look for him.
 Do we have his home address?
 Maybe it's written in something
he brought with him.
 Hey!
 Who you looking for?
No-one.
 I used to live here.
 Thought someone might have
left a message for me.
 It was a stupid idea.
 Want some chewing gum?
 You can come back with me...
 ...if you like.
 Yeah.
 What are we stopping for?
 Taking a look. Who knows
what it's like in here now?
 Everything's fine. Let's go.
 Send someone to get Gavin's body.
I don't want it lying in the road.
 You had no right to kidnap that
girl.
 We have to operate within the law.
 Do you think Abby knew
what he was going to do?
 Well, until I know the truth,
I'm holding them all responsible.
 They were seen an hour ago
heading into the city.
 I will not allow murder
to go unpunished.
 I used to love this place.
 Now it just...
 No running water, not much food.
 Whoever's left in here is
gonna be getting desperate by now.
 Have you got the address?
 Keep your eyes open, everyone.
 - Who's that?
- It's all right. He's with me.
 Well, we'll go out tomorrow
and have a look.
 Maybe we'll find someone
who knows you.
 Yeah, it's a big city.
There's always a chance.
 Course, you have to do
your bit in return.
 I don't mind working.
I looked after chickens.
 Everyone pulls their weight.
If they don't, they're out.
 Yeah, don't go on, Craig.
Najid's tired.
 And if you want rewards,
you have to contribute.
 We're not a charity.
 Hey, hey, hey!
 Those are for you, Najid.
 Bringing you here
was the first useful thing
 that Darren has done in weeks.
 He doesn't deserve biscuits.
 I think I should go now.
 I shouldn't have run away.
 Trust me - you don't want
to be on your own out there.
 I'm all ri...all right.
 Course you are.
 You're my little Dazzler, ain't ya?
 You take Najid out later
and you show him the ropes.
 Thanks, Craig.
 His temperature's up again.
 It's just a cold.
 What if it isn't?
 What if it's typhoid
or something infectious?
 He could wipe us all out.
 I'll deal with it.
 You could just drive him somewhere.
 Waste of petrol.
 It's kinder to finish it now.
 He's a nice kid.
 Who do you think they are?
 I don't know.
 Maybe there is someone
still in charge.
 Maybe it's from the Government.
 Wouldn't that be brilliant?
 Yes. Brilliant.
 Well?
 No sign of him.
 Well, maybe he just doesn't
want to be found.
 what everyone else is thinking.
 Look, we're the closest thing
he's got to a family.
 He knows that.
 He's probably out there right now,
scared and lonely.
 We're just gonna have to find him.
 Well, it's getting late.
 We'd better start searching.
 We're gonna hang on here tonight...
 ...in case he shows up.
 Oi!
 Take it!
 Great.
 Go! Go!
 Someone should have been
keeping watch!
 You know, someone else could take
responsibility once in a while.
 That's not fair.
 Look, there's no point
in blaming each other.
 Ready?
 Why'd you choose
to stay with Craig?
 I've got nowhere else to go.
 He's all right sometimes. If
we work hard, he lets us play games.
 Great. This one's open.
 Let me help you.
 Come on!
Watch out.
 Quick.
 Someone got here before us.
 I don't think
there'll be anything here.
 What was that?
  Run!
  Quick! Hurry up!
Ow.
 Go! Quick!
 Help! No! Help!
Come here.
 Kick him!
 Run!
Run quickly!
 Come here!
 Shh, shh, shh. Calm.
 Calm.
 Quiet.
 Quick. Let's go.
 How many times
have I told you to be careful?
 You should've
checked the place out first.
 Where's your rucksack?
 I dropped it.
 You've been out for hours,
and come back with nothing.
 Even Najid did better than that.
 Go on. Get off to bed.
 Come on.
 And you.
 June.
Mm-hm?
 I feel sick.
You'll feel better in the morning.
 I want my mum.
Hey.
 Come on.
 Let's get you to bed.
 Hey.
 You did well, Najid.
 You're gonna be all right here.
 We need to find somewhere
to rest up.
 Hang on.
 OK. We'll start again
in the morning.
 He could be out right now
looking for us.
 Well, he could be anywhere.
 It's hopeless trying to...
It's NOT hopeless.
 We're going to find him.
Of course we are.
 All I'm saying is...
No. Peter needs us.
 I mean Najid. Najid needs us.
We can't let him down.
 Abby, Greg's right.
There's nothing more we can do now.
 They're taking pictures of us.
 What do they want?
  I hope Tom's OK up there.
  What do you think?
 Let's try over there.
 Better find somewhere safe.
Can't afford to lose anything else.
 This won't last
more than a day, you know.
 What you saying?
 We have to be realistic.
Look, I lost my son.
 I'm not losing Najid.
 Don't you think
I care about him too?
 I don't know. Do you?
 For what it's worth, I'm sorry.
 Why did you do it?
 I panicked.
 You sold me out.
 It's all right, I...
 ...might have done
the same thing in your shoes.
 Really?
 Not really, no.
 Just saying that
to make you feel better.
 I don't blame you for hating me.
 I don't hate you.
 I haven't the strength
for that any more.
 Since the virus,
it doesn't seem worth it.
 Couldn't leave him.
 I think I've lost him anyway.
 It's not me he wants.
 Never has been.
 You must know.
 Don't you see
the way he looks at you?
 Tom's a friend. That's all.
 You like him...the way he likes you.
 I can see it.
Y-you're wrong.
 Sarah, I...I'm tired...now.
 It's all right.
It's all right.
 You're OK. OK.
 What's going on?
CRAIG: Go back to sleep.
 This is all my fault.
 If I hadn't
been so hard on Naj,
 he'd still be at home
and we wouldn't be in this mess.
 Do you know, self-pity really
doesn't suit you.
 Can't even wallow in peace.
 You're not alone, Abby.
 OK, Dad.
 What?
 It's about the only thing I cook.
It's sort of a family joke.
 Except my wife used it
against me in the divorce,
 said I wasn't...
 ...said I wasn't capable
of looking after them properly.
 So what happened?
Joint custody.
 Said she was taking the kids
to Boston for a holiday.
 They never came back.
 I spent months
looking for them.
 Checked out sightings
as far as, um, Texas...
 ...and Canada.
 Tried the police...
 ...private detectives.
 Oh, God, it was, um...
 It was 18 months ago.
 Just would have been nice
to say goodbye to them, you know?
 I'm so sorry, Greg.
 You know, sometimes now,
when I think of Peter...
 ..I can't remember his face.
 I have this...this nightmare,
 where...one day I find him again,
 and...we just...
 ...we just pass each other by
like strangers.
 Every day I feel him slipping
further and further away from me.
 I'm so tired of hoping
for a miracle.
 I want to just let him go but...
 You can't.
 You can't.
 That's the trouble with hope.
 As long as you don't know for
sure...
 ...it never goes away.
 You know what I keep wondering?
 What if Samantha's right?
 What if hers is the only way?
 You know, maybe...
 ...maybe we need someone like her
to protect us from ourselves.
 Maybe safety matters
more than freedom.
 No. You don't believe that.
 I used to be so sure
about everything.
 Good and bad, right and wrong.
 I just want to stop being afraid.
 It's not too late to go back.
 We can never go back.
 Tom killed Gavin.
 I knew it.
I knew why he stayed behind.
 He was going to...
 It was self-defence.
 I mean, who is he, Abby?
 What do we really know about him?
  Hey!
 They got the water!
 - Get outta here!
 That's it, we've got nothing left.
We've got no food, no water.
 If we stay here now,
God knows what happens to us.
 Well, I told you -
I'm not leaving without Naj.
 I'm staying too, no matter what.
 I never liked the country anyway.
 You realise we could end up
like them?
 Well, you go if you want to.
 No-one would blame you.
 You really think I'd leave you
on your own?
 We'll all just have to
starve together, then.
 Come on, let's go and find Najid.
 Shar, do you want
some fruit salad?
 OK. Plenty for seconds.
Morning, Naj.
 Where's Darren?
Just give that to Craig.
 He took off in the night.
It happens.
 I saw you wake him up.
  You were dreaming, son.
 People come and go.
It's not a prison.
 What about some breakfast,
yeah?
 And then Craig can take you out
to have a look around.
 You're a good kid, Naj.
 You're gonna fit in
no bother at all.
 I'm sorry, I can't stay.
I've got to go look for Abby.
 Well, you can't leave, mate.
 You've eaten our food,
you've slept in our bed.
 How you gonna pay us back?
 Some tea.
 Come on, tuck in, you lot.
 I'm dying for a cup of tea.
Who wants tea?
 Work hard and you'll do OK with me.
 The more you bring in,
the better you live.
 Computer time, food,
whatever you want.
 It's all about results.
 I told you, I wanna go find Abby.
 Forget Abby.
I'm your only friend now.
 I'm trying to do you a favour here,
sunshine.
 My dad kept lots of stuff at home.
 Batteries and stuff like that.
Maybe I could get it for you.
 I'll go with you.
 I'll take my bike.
It's only a few minutes away.
 You wouldn't be lying to me, Najid,
would you?
 Well, I hope not for your sake.
 You're on your own now, son.
 Sooner you accept that, the better.
 Wait here.
 There's nothing there. Go.
 Get off.
 Come on.
Don't touch me.
 Naj?
 Naj!
 Al! He's on me.
 Oi, let him go.
Stay back!
 Get in.
 What's he worth to you?
What?
 Well, you want him back.
What are you gonna give me?
 Here.
 I've got a cupboard full of watches.
 Limited-edition, worth Â£5,000.
Is that it?
 You wanna go
to the cash machine?
 Not good enough.
 The back!
 Oi!
 No!
 Al!
 Ooh! Aaagh!
 Come on, come out.
 Give me my bloody watch back.
 Give me my watch back!
 Who needs it, anyway?
 He's just a kid.
 You came looking for me.
 Course I bloody did, you idiot.
 Aaah!
 Think I've broken a knuckle.
 God had a plan for you
all this time.
 What?
 He sent you to look after me.
 What about me?
Don't I get any credit?
 Where's Abby?
 She'll be here any minute.
 Well, whoever they are,
they obviously don't wanna talk.
 Let's get going.
Al will be getting jumpy.
 Greg, listen to me. Greg.
 It'll be OK. Stay with me, Greg.
 Tom!
 Greg. You're gonna be OK.
 What's going on?
 Abby!
Tom!
 Abby!
 Get Tom!
 Help!
 Help me!
Tom!
 Abby!
 Help me!
 Tom!
 Quick.
They've taken Abby.
 Greg. Greg, look at me.
 Why have they taken Abby?
 Hey, Peter!
 Time we got going.
