 Survivors (2008â€“2010): Season 1, Episode 2 - Episode #1.2 - full transcript 
 The group set up camp in a big house from where they send out a scavenger party to a supermarket but are forced to withdraw by another, armed, group. Abby believes one of the men may have information about her son but she gets no joy. Greg, meanwhile, comes across a warehouse full of food and a couple, Sarah and the injured Bob.

 The European flu crisis deepened today. The entire population has already been exposed. The virus causes our own immune systems to turn against us. The Prime Minister died a few minutes ago. I urge you all to behave responsibly, to be good neighbours and to avoid panic. You survive the plague and get killed over something silly like this. Abby, don't do this! If I recovered, maybe my son did too. He could be out there somewhere. That's Phil Emerson... with Peter. Take it.

 I mean, he could be out there right now, looking for me. So few of us left. Thank you. Every new person feels like a gift. Everything we ever knew has been ripped away from us. Our old life is dead. Now, we have to build a new one. And we can't do it alone. There is only one choice. We stand together or die. Synch: Michvanilly, Tyno Transcript: Chocolate We need more snacks. Peanuts, pistachios, that kind of thing. Oh, and some wine. The good stuff. Nothing under a tenner. Have fun!

 We left him alone, he'd starve to death waiting for the supermarket to deliver. Let's get going before the shops shut. Naj, Greg made a joke! Yeah, it wasn't funny though. - Where you going? - Won't be long. Just going to check something out. LOOTER Let's get out of here, come on. Let's go! Doing a bit of shopping? We needed food and drink. So you thought you'd just steal it? People have to know this place belongs to us. They need to respect our property. You need to give that back now. Don't you touch him! I wouldn't. You seem like nice people, so I'm gonna give you a break. Come on. We'll be watching. Can't you see how wrong this is? - What are you looking at? - Wanna make sure I remember your face. You'd better. Do you really think they killed him? Who knows? Maybe he was dead already. The point is, they're capable of it. I reckon in their minds, they've already crossed the line. This is exactly why I wanted to get away from everyone. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Look, not everyone is gonna be like them. There are going to be a lot of good people left in the world. Well, being good isn't enough any more. We need to be organised. I mean, this isn't a game. This is real now. Come on. They were just trying to frighten you. You weren't there. All right, so we'll just stay out of their way. You think they're going to be the only ones? All I'm saying is let's not panic, all right? - It's not Lord Of The Rings yet, is it? - Flies. You mean Lord Of The Flies. Yeah, right. The one with the fat kid. They killed someone, Al. Doesn't that mean anything to you? Of course it does. Look, we could be in danger, every time we go out looking for food. We've still got plenty of stuff. Sooner or later, everything easy will be gone. What are you going to do then? You really want this to be a nightmare, don't you? I want you to face reality. Something you seem to have a problem with. I don't need lessons in reality from you, my friend. Greg's right. What's left in the shops won't last forever. We need to grab everything we can before someone else does. Fight them for it, if we have to. Not if we end up like those people in the supermarket. We are still human beings. All the rules have changed now. And the sooner we all realise that, the better the chance we've got of staying alive. Sarah? What time is it? Late. I never eat breakfast. I told you that. But it was a nice gesture. Thank you, Bob. That car was outside again. Did they see you? Do you think they know about this place? If they did, they'd be here by now. Haven't you got work to do? I just thought... If you must. I'm just going out to get a few things. I'll come with you... just in case. I don't see why we can't just leave it. We'll get rats. I hate rats. I saw them on the streets, before you found me. They were just scampering about in the open. It was like somehow, they knew we'd gone. I could do with some help. I couldn't. The smell's disgusting. Getting ill doesn't really bear thinking about, does it? A small cut could become tetanus. A cough, pneumonia. Makes you feel quite vulnerable. Unless you happen to know a friendly doctor. Look, I don't want the others to know. Why not? Different life. Different person. How about you? What did you do before? I robbed things. Killed a few people. That's not funny. Oh, it had its moments. Fine. I don't care, anyway. You know, we're alike, you and I. We both know that who we were doesn't matter any more. It's who we are now that counts. How long will all this last? A lifetime. Not now, I'm thinking. Once we've built up the local business, we can start running trucks to other places. - Who's going to drive them? - We'll recruit people we can trust. In a few years, it'll be a national business. I'll be rich. We'll be rich. Of course. What did I say? - You're very beautiful. - You're always saying that. Find me some decent red wine. I don't like cheap champagne. Tastes like metal. So, from now on, we go out foraging every day. We treat it like a job. If anyone's got a problem with that, say so now. OK, Greg, Tom and I will cover the supermarkets today. Al, Anya and Najid, you look for the smaller shops. There's something else. We all know that there's plenty of food and water out there. But a lot of it isn't going to be in the shops. You mean houses? Good food is no use to the dead. That's pretty cold, isn't it? If we don't do it, someone else will. Look, I know how hard it is. But the way I see it, we've got no choice. Listen, I found this in the supermarket. It's a... delivery note from the central distribution warehouse. I know this area. My husband did some work there once. Might be some valuable stuff there, I'll check it out. - We can all go. - I travel better alone. You're not thinking of walking out on us, are you, Greg? If I was, I'd tell you. You came here yesterday, didn't you? You could have told me. I thought you wouldn't come. You don't like being pushed around. I admire that. I'm like it myself. Well, looks like no-one's here. I guess I'm your lucky charm. - What are you doing? - There was a man here yesterday. I have to see him again. Well, don't just stand there! Come on. Idiot! So, you've never even met this Emerson character before? That's him. You reckon he was here yesterday? I think so. It looked like him. I don't know. But if it is him, he'll know what's happened to Peter. For you... for keeping us all together. What happened to you, Tom? Why were you attacked? I hitched a lift with the wrong people, that's all. They beat me up and then chucked me out of the car. You don't strike me as the kind of man who gets taken by surprise. Come on, let's go. We're pushing our luck. That's them. Let me do the talking. My friend wants to ask you a question. Check in the back. You, get out ofthe car! I told you to stay away! You're out of order. You know that. Shut up! Is he here? Who are you talking about? A guy called Phil Emerson. She thinks that she saw him here with you yesterday. This is him. He knows what happened to my son. On your knees. Get down on the ground. You too. Get down! Just keep nice and calm, mate, eh? I told you to stay away from my stuff. Did you think I was joking? Then why did you come back? I told you. I was looking for someone. Don't give me that bullshit! You're thieving. I told you to shut up! Now, next time, pay attention. I don't want to see you here again. You're all right. Come on. You've got to help me. Bob's badly hurt. I tried to move him, but he's in terrible pain. He was screaming all night. I couldn't stand it. He's in the warehouse. - Didn't you hear me? - Yeah, yeah, I heard you. This way... Hurry! - What's your name? - Sarah. I'm Greg. You left him like this? Well, I couldn't move it on my own. It's a compound fracture. We're going to have to reset the bone. What have you given him for the pain? We need some painkillers. And any, any bandages or swabs we can find. Can you hear me? Listen, mate, you've broken your leg. I'll do what I can. Come on. You might want to hold his hand or something. I'd look away now, if I were you. I was talking to him. I was so scared. I thought he was going to kill me. It's gonna be madness out there now, isn't it? You know what your problem is? You think that people are basically good... but they're not. When it comes down to it, we'll do anything to get what we want. Anything. I don't believe you. We're better than that. We have to be. The world's a bad place, Abby. Always was. Now there's no... there's no civilisation left, there's no protection. We're seeing each other for what we really are and it's not pretty. You need to get used to that. I need a new jacket. - You've got clothes. - Take a tip from me, you've got to look good... to feel good. You see? God wants me to have this jacket. You're wasting time. You're going to have to lighten up. It's like having Jiminy bloody Cricket in my ear the whole time. Oh, look! A sweet shop, your lucky day. Go and have some fun. - What about you? - I'm busy. I need some new shirts. You people! - Help! Al, help! - You're like wolves! Steeling my stuff! Help me! What're you doing?! Get off him! Get out! Get off! - Let's get out of here. - We can't just leave him. He's dead. Come on. Come on! You didn't mean to hurt him. We should pray for him. We don't tell anyone about this. Come on. Let's get Anya. What's wrong? Nothing. What happened to your arm? I slipped. Banged it. - Let me look at it. - It's fine. It's just a bruise. Everything OK? Makes you feel like a thief, doesn't it? Will he be able to walk again? The gangrene will kill him long before you have to worry about that. He needs antibiotics. There's a chemist in the town. We can be there in 20 minutes. We'll wait until dark. Why? No-one knows we're here. Let's keep it that way. I'm not frightened. You should be. You know, maybe something's happened to him. Or maybe he's just walked out on us. No, he wouldn't do that. He was talking about going off on his own. Talking about it all the time. No, he said he'd come back. I trust him. Never trust anybody and you'll never be disappointed. If that's how you live, I feel sorry for you. He's a big boy, I'm sure he can look after himself. He'll come back when he wants to. If he wants to. I hate drinking on my own. Come on, someone join me. You're a Muslim. You shouldn't be drinking... Shouldn't you be in bed? All right, I could use a drink. Go to bed, Abby. We'll stay up for him. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. I'm tired too. Night. What are you doing? Finding the right drugs for Bob. Was the virus bad where you were? About the same as everywhere, I expect. My mother died early on. And then Daddy went as well. I didn't know what to do. I just walked about for ages, living off chocolate and chewing gum. Then Bob found me. He was the manager of our local supermarket. He said he'd seen me shopping there and fallen in love from a distance. That's a bit creepy, isn't it? He went to the warehouse when things got bad. He knew how much food there was. - I suppose it was quite clever of him. - So now you two... - I didn't have any choice. - He forced you? He told me he wouldn't look after me if I didn't do what he wanted. Come. This is new. Come on, Dexter. It's a bloody book shop! You can learn a lot from books. What do you miss most from before? My family. Friends. And boyfriend? I didn't have a boyfriend. How about you? What do you miss? My laptop. What? It's true. We spent a lot of time together. It was smart... sensitive, easy to handle. You must have been very sad when it died. I don't want to talk about the past. No point. What's done is done... and you can't change it. To life. Life. You're very beautiful. Why do I get the impression that you don't take me seriously? Be honest! You're only interested because I'm the last resort. That's not true. Come on, please? I really need some company tonight. I understand, Al. I do. But I'm not the one. I'm going to bed, now. On my own. What you doing? I thought there might be someone out there, but it's just static. Do you think the people that own this house mind us living in it? I don't think so. I wouldn't want someone sleeping in my bedroom. I'd come and haunt them. One day we'll find somewhere where we can make a fresh start. We'll grow our own food, maybe keep a few animals. Cows, sheep, chickens, that sort of thing. My dad said I should look for my cousins. But they're probably all dead, aren't they? If there's someone out there, Najid, we'll find them one day, I promise. Come on. Get some sleep. - What is that? - Penicillin. Will it stop the wound from getting infected? It'd better. Otherwise you'll have to amputate his leg. Come on, Bob. Get these down you. Well done. He'll need two, three times a day. There's nothing more I can do here. Good luck. Where are you going? - My friends will be expecting me back. - You can't go now. Please. I can't be alone tonight. All right. I'll get the brandy. You realise how valuable all this stuff is? Of course I do. This place is my ticket to a decent life. I'll trade with people for the things that I need. Or they'll work for me, growing vegetables and things. I can pay them with goods. Who knows? I might even end up wealthy. Money won't be much use to you. We're bound to need money again one day. Life won't always be grim. You really think you can hang onto this place? Why shouldn't I? There are people who'd slit your throat for a bottle of water. I'm sure someone will protect me. What about you, Greg? Do you have plans? I did. But they changed. Why? - I met some people. - The friends you were talking about? There was this woman. Abby. What she said made sense. But you don't owe her anything. Not exactly. I'm drunk. I'm going to bed. Good idea. I'm so lonely, Greg. You've been through a lot. You're traumatised. We all are. If this happens now, how am I any better than Bob? This is different. I want you. I'm not staying, Sarah. Sleeping with me isn't going to help that. Is it because of this Abby? Not like that. - Then why not? - It's better for both of us. We have to share the bed. I'll take the sofa. Suit yourself. If you change your mind, you know where I am. Sorry. Good morning. Still no sign of Greg? I'll go and wake Naj. You know you're doing a good job with him, Al. His parents would be grateful. If Peter is alive, I hope he's found someone like you. You're trying to do too much. - You'll hurt yourself again. - I don't like lying around. Fine. Do what you like. I'm sorry. I'll be a good boy, I promise. No more than 20 minutes' exercise a day. Whatever you say, Doc. Don't call me that. You saved my life, Anya. That makes us connected. I owe you one. I can look after myself. The world's going to be a dangerous place now. The weak need protecting. I'm not weak. You're actually excited by all this, aren't you? Don't go, Greg. - Stay with me. - I can't. Bob's going to die. We both know that. I told you I don't love him. I couldn't. There's enough food and drink in here to last forever. I've got a better idea. Why don't you get some stuff, put it in the car, come with me. - What? - You'll like my friends. They're good people. - What about my business? - That's just a dream, Sarah. You're worse than Bob. At least he understood. Look, if I found this place, other people will. I don't want you getting hurt. We could make this work, Greg, please. I saw the address. I know the area. Face it, he's not coming back. - You're wrong. - Are you sure, Abby? - You don't know him. - He might have been attacked. He could be lying somewhere injured. I can't stand around here doing nothing, thinking he might need our help. You're being naive. It could be any one of us out there. I'm going to find him. I saved your life. I gave you what you wanted. That makes us quits. I love you! What use is that now? What are you doing? She's gonna get herself killed. What you looking at? You. I'm going after her. Let's go. Sorry, did I make you jump? Do you know what I like about you? You're the type of guy that makes people feel great about themselves. Thanks. It's a gift, that. You should use it wisely. Just... one more thing. If you ever make a move on Anya again, I'm gonna break your neck. What, is this a joke? If you guys are together... She doesn't want you near her any more. See you later. I didn't think you'd mind. At least do me a favour before you go? I've had a flat tyre for ages. Bob always said he'd fix it, but... I don't think he really wanted to. Thought I might drive away. Where's the spare? In the boot, I suppose. Are you all right? Fine. I can't stop thinking about that old man. Just leave it out, all right?! Look! Abby said we'd grow our own stuff one day. Have animals and that. Come on! I got him, Naj! I killed him. You must be Abby. - It's not what you think. - It doesn't matter what I think. I just wanted to know you were OK. - Now l do, I'll go. - Don't look so bloody wounded. She's got an injured man in there. She couldn't manage. It's a gold mine. Enough food and drink to last us a lifetime. And it's mine. The offer still stands, Greg. What offer? Well, half of everything if he stays with me. And the answer's no. It was always no. I don't belong here. Well, I've done my best. But for some reason, he seems quite attached to you. Apology accepted. Look, let's just take what we need and then we'll go. I'm starting a business. This is my stock. Look, whatever's in there belongs to everyone. This place is mine! I worked for it. I'm entitled! - Don't be so stupid. - You can't have it! It's mine! - That's enough, Sarah. - Get off! Get off me! - For God's sake, Greg, just leave it! - Abby, we need this food. It's not worth fighting for. If that's how we're going to live, I'd rather die. You will warn. This is my territory. You're trespassing. This is ridiculous! Find out what they've got in there. Tell her not to take another step, Dexter. Who told you my name? You can learn a lot from books. Look, I'm trying to be nice. I don't want anyone hurt. Who the hell do you think you are? This is my property. I'll kill you if I have to. You're not gonna believe this. We've hit the jackpot. - You think yourselves lucky. - This place belongs to me! I'm sorry, change of ownership, darling. You're welcome to stay, though. I'm a very generous employer. Sorry about the slap. What, you want some? Come on! Hard man, eh? You think I won't use it? You've only got one shot in there. Go for it. You better make sure you kill me though. Shoot him and I'm still here. Trust me, I'll even up the score before you can blink. - Odds don't sound as good now, do they? - Shut it! Both of you. You can start a small war. Or you can put the gun down. We'll all go about our business. Your choice. I'm having a very nice day today. Why spoil it? You better go while I'm still in a good mood. Go on! Take me with you! - You can't leave me with them! - Aren't you forgetting something? - Bob's dead. - Greg, let's go! Get in. Next time. - Come here! - Come on. Help me. Please. Come on. You're OK now. You were wrong about Greg. This time. Why did you come looking for us? I had nothing better to do. Maybe human nature's not so bad then. You can believe that if you want. Look, eggs! Me and Al found some chickens. We're having omelettes for tea. We're gonna keep animals and stuff, like you said. This is Sarah. She'll be staying with us. Hi, Sarah. Do you like eggs? Come on, let me show you the chickens. How did you know he wouldn't shoot you? Just a hunch. There's an intruder in the basement car park. - Has he seen anything? - I don't think so. - What's he doing? - Scavenging, by the look of it. Alert security and tell them to take the propriate action. If he gets in, we're dead. There's no chance of that. We're completely secure. For how long? Suppose he brings other people here? The work's too important. We can't take that chance. No contact of any kind with any living thing! I do know you. You're in the government. This place, what you're doing, it's everything I've dreamt of. But I don't want to go home! Kate, you can't go back. Come on. We have no idea how many of them are out there. Guilty or not guilty? I don't want to be locked up any more. If we don't hit them now, and hard... they'll be back again, and again and again. Justice and mercy. This is our law.
