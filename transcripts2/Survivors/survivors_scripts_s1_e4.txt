 You're a prisoner of
Her Majesty's Government.
 You've got 20 years
left to serve, Price.
 There he is!
 I have no choice...
 but to pass a sentence of death.
 Don't you dare. Don't you dare!
 Justice and mercy.
 - This is our law.
- You really think he might be alive?
 Looking for her son Peter, 12 today.
 There's an estate called Waterhouse.
 Somewhere east of here.
I've heard there may be children there.
 Sync: Michvanilly, Tyno
Transcript: Chocolate
 What are you doing?
He's round here.
 Freeze!
 Weapons?
 Confiscated.
 Bit dull, this blade.
 - Think it'll still cut your throats?
- Don't kill us.
 Then you tell your friends...
 Time to go.
 So, where are you taking me?
 I just wanted to talk to you
with no-one else around.
 I've got to go.
 Again.
 Samantha Willis told me about
this place called Waterhouse.
 She said there
are some children there.
 And you think maybe
one of them's your son.
 Peter is not dead.
 Great. Good luck.
 - See you, sometime.
- Wait.
 If you go,
they'll go to Willis', they won't wait.
 I'm gonna come back.
 - Guys, I feel we should wash up.
- What!
 - You telling me to wash up? Bruv?
- We can heat the water!
 Catch.
 Bone china?
 200 years old?
 Let's be more careful, yeah?
 Come on...
 - She's got everything.
- Hot baths.
 Electricity. Computer games.
 Now you'll see how good I am.
 Now you'll see how good I am.
 You forgotten the bit
where she shot the woman?
 So she's a bit strict.
 A bit strict?
Executing thieves?
 You want to live under that regime?
 So she was part
of the Government, right?
 You know what Abby felt.
She couldn't stay there.
 Well, Abby's gone.
 - She'll be back.
- Will she?
 - Let's stick together.
- Absolutely, let's stick together.
 Why don't we all go?
 Come on, it'll be great.
 Well, someone's got to stay
here to look after your chickens.
 - Don't eat them.
- Promise.
 And you look after Al.
 Come on, Al, get your stuff.
 I just... I wanna go, see it.
 Sounds amazing.
 I'll miss ya.
 I'll miss you too.
 One day.
 - See ya later.
- Bye.
 See ya.
 Stop... It's Peter.
 Guys...
 What's happened, mate?
 I've been thinking,
we could find a better place than this.
 The nutter?
 Well, he didn't hurt you, did he?
 He took my knife.
He's not going away.
 And neither are we.
 Let's go hunting.
 Lads, how you doing?
 Samantha Willis live here?
 Abby Grant sent us.
 Cheers.
 This is dinner.
 Starve the enemy.
Feed ourselves.
 You eat that, I'll eat you.
 Get him!
 Very nice.
 Welcome.
 How's Abby?
 She's... preoccupied poor thing.
 Her son.
 Yes, of course.
 I offered to assist her
but you know what she's like.
 Yeah. On her own journey.
 Didn't like our rules.
 Hello, you, it's nice to have
such a big strong lad around.
 - And...
- Al.
 Pleased to meet you, Samantha.
 - You're not dad, are you?
- No way!
 No, we met on the road.
 Right.
 It's great to have you here.
 I'm not sure how much Abby's told you,
but there's really only one rule here.
 You reap what you sow.
 Lots of rewards, security, food,
 water, hot water,
 alcohol, sweets, games.
 - X-Box? Playstation?
- We've got both.
 And else.
 Yes, rewards and work to earn them.
 Absolutely.
 Would you show our
new friends around?
 And then Gavin will
assign you to a task-group.
 And I'll see you later.
 - Thank you, Ma'am.
- No need for that.
 Abby told me what
you did to the thief.
 That...
must have taken a lot of courage.
 I'm Tom. How you doing?
 Where are you from?
 Salford.
 15 Hopper Street.
 Do you want the postcode?
 Spread out!
 I got him.
 Come on, he's wounded.
 - What the hell are you doing?
- So sorry.
 - I won't be with you long.
- You can't just...
 Drive!
 Wheels!
 Come on, get him!
 Open this door now!
 Great, keep going.
 That's it, keep going.
 We're clear.
 The tyre's burst,
the windscreen's...
 We are not clear...
We are not, "we!"
 I'm sorry.
 And it's not funny!
 You're quite right.
 Why were they chasing you?
 Turn here.
 Anywhere down this track.
 It should be OK here.
 Jimmy Garland.
 Thanks for saving my life.
 Why were they chasing you?
 I'll explain that.
 Let's change your wheel quickly,
so you can get away.
 Now they'll be cross with you too.
 Great, shredded!
 We need to find you another vehicle
 which given the windscreen's
probably a good idea.
 - You're hurt.
- It's just a scratch.
 There are cars a few miles off.
I can take you.
 No, you can't.
 All right.
 Right now,
 I'll dress this first.
 If you don't mind,
perhaps you could come to my place...
 for a moment.
 I'm not trying to pick you up.
 Well, that's a relief.
 Only me.
 Who did you think it was?
 No-one.
 Taxis can never find it.
 I'll make some tea in a sec...
 Just fix my puncture.
 What can I do?
 Shine a light?
 I found this cave with my cousin,
 when we were nine.
 We used to sleep here.
 So, you live...
 - Lived nearby?
- We did, yeah.
 We're on the Estate now.
My family was in London.
 They used to come
and stay every summer.
 God, it was so sudden, wasn't it?
 London was bad,
 so I came out here.
 They were all dead...
 my cousins,
 my aunt and uncle.
 And the house was...
 occupied.
 By the kids who attacked us?
 I did ask them to leave.
They declined.
 So, I retreated...
 to sit out the invasion.
 As the last of the family
it's my job,
 for better or worse,
to maintain the place.
 Waterhouse?
 What?
 I knew I was nearby.
I must have missed the turning.
 The house? Yeah,
it was just before you ran into me.
 Is there a 12-year-old boy there?
His name's Peter?
 I don't know.
It could be.
 Your son?
 He was on a school field
trip and he left the centre.
 I can't tell.
 - I need to go to the house.
- Of course you do.
 I'm sorry.
 Now you've helped me,
you won't be welcome.
 Yes, I will...
if I'm his mother.
 I'll get you close.
A vantage point.
 Use the binoculars, see if it's him.
 Are you OK?
 Sorry, it's just a bit sore.
 Look, you can't go anywhere now.
 Be all right in a minute.
 There's some,
there's tea on the shelf,
 and milk,
 and honey...
 The promised land.
 How's it going?
 Good.
 Good to work.
 Simple pleasures.
 Bloody hell.
 Time to stop soon.
 Time to stop now, love.
 Come on...
 Come on, pal.
 On your feet.
 That's the spirit.
 Maybe it's Abby.
 How are you doing?
 Do I look like a leper?
 So is it just the pair of you?
 There are four others,
 three men.
 Where are they?
 Foraging.
 Foraging?
 What's that?
 Looking for stuff.
 That's what we're doing.
 We're foraging.
 We have nothing.
 Except the clothes on your back?
 That's our house,
you can't just walk in.
 We've brought a bottle.
 Now can we come in?
 Fair enough.
 Another time.
 Leave you to it.
 Maybe they were OK.
 Night.
 Great
 A dorm.
 I'll get nightmares.
 It's all right for you. You
didn't go to boarding school, did you?
 Stop complaining.
 You tell him, kid.
 Are you sleeping here?
 Blokes only allowed in here, baby.
 I've got a room to myself.
 Great effort, everyone.
 What did you do before?
 Play.
 That's what you did, played?
 That's what he did!
 Cars, casinos,
 girls...
 All paid for by his rich dad.
 - I worked in my parents' shop.
- Good for you.
 - Thanks, Naj.
- Impressive.
 All right for some.
 Well, you know,
we all can't be politicians, can we?
 Serving the people.
 Can I have word?
 Of course.
 Night, all.
 You ever get your hands dirty?
 It's funny you arriving with Al...
 Such opposites.
 I'll take that as a compliment.
 And if he were to leave?
 How would you feel about that?
 No problem.
 Sometimes I feel like leaving.
 Walking away.
 You shouldn't.
 We need you...
 And if, if you need anything then,
 just ask.
 Thanks.
 Can I have a word?
 No rest for the wicked.
 Thank you.
 Good night.
 Morning.
 Morning.
 I'm so sorry I've delayed you.
 You must be desperate
to get to the house.
 Let's go.
 Morning.
 We like to have
a few moments silence
 at the beginning of the day.
 Great.
 Before we eat.
 How was I supposed to know?
 By getting up when you're asked to.
 By being down on time.
 I'm not a kid.
 That's enough!
 Shut up!
 I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.
 How do people feel?
 Who here, would like Al...
 to stay?
 Me!
 Motion carried.
 You finished, Naj?
 - We'd like Najid to stay.
- Impossible. He sticks with me.
 I don't think
you're a suitable guardian.
 It's in Najid's best interests to remain
here, in a secure environment.
 How can best put this to you?
I do not recognise your authority.
 You got that?
 OK, mate, time to go.
 You're safe here, OK?
 Yeah, but Al's all right.
 You have to give him a chance.
 It's all right, Naj.
 I'd rather be on my own.
 Great.
 - I'll help you get your stuff.
- I got it.
 I'll give you a hand.
See you out of here safely.
 Thank you, Tom.
 No problem.
 Enjoy.
 We had to be
a bit strict with him, Naj,
 because I think he thought he was
a bit better than the rest of us.
 Whereas you, and everyone else here,
 are willing to work, to learn,
to contribute to the community,
 to the future, of this...
 Our battered,
but unbeaten human race.
 We're a team, OK?
 Oi, Peter, come down here.
 Stop her!
 Get her! Stop her! Get her!
 I've got her.
 The nutter's fairy godmother!
 Hidden weapon?
 No! I've come for Peter.
 He's my son.
 Really?
 Just a sec.
 Let's go inside.
 Have a seat.
 - Where is he?
- He's upstairs.
 You screwed us up yesterday
rescuing your friend.
 Show us his hideout
and you can see your son.
 I would if I could
but I can't, I can't.
 He blindfolded me.
 - I want to see her.
- Will wants you to stay here.
 It might not be her.
 Mum! Mum!
 - Let me see him.
- Lead us to your friend.
 You're not my mum.
 I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...
 Don't touch me!
 - I'll leave you in peace.
- No, no you won't.
 Come on, she's been through a lot.
We should let her go.
 That's your plan? Interesting.
 Listen, I'm sorry about your car.
 He's freaking us out so much.
 We went, you know,
just a bit mental.
 - This is war.
- Yeah, but it's not her fault.
 - How bad's his injury?
- He's fine.
 He's fighting fit.
 We just want him
to stop hassling us.
 Then leave.
 We had trouble, out there.
 It's not safe.
 You know what?
 He could make you safer.
 I mean, he knows the land...
He can teach you how to live off of it.
 So you never have to leave.
 Look...
 Maybe I can persuade him,
you know, to talk to you.
 Before somebody really gets hurt.
 That's it... 20 miles.
 I've wasted enough fuel.
 Thanks for the ride.
 Sleep well?
 You?
 Dreamt about my mother.
 She was a teacher.
 - What did she teach?
- Chemistry.
 We were shopping for clothes.
 I was 12.
 And we were agreeing,
so I know I was dreaming.
 It's hard to defend ourselves
here with only the two of us.
 And no weapons.
 Maybe we should go.
 Just give her one more day.
 Are you all right?
 - I'm fine.
- Good, good, good.
 Wrong boy.
 I'm sorry.
 This does not mean your son is dead.
 Come on.
 That was delicious.
 Should've been here a couple of days
ago. I got a trout from the river.
 Where'd you find the courgettes?
 Garden in the village.
 You stole them?
 What if the owner's heir
had turned up and caught you?
 I would've apologised,
relinquished them and left him in peace.
 They didn't interrogate you?
 I told them you blindfolded me
on the way to your hideout.
 Wish I'd thought of that.
 - Want another hit?
- I'm OK.
 You know what they need?
 They need the right adult.
 They need someone who's stronger
and braver and cleverer than them.
 This isn't their idea.
 No, they're open to negotiate.
 They want to stop fighting.
 They've had enough?
 They won't leave.
 But maybe that's a good thing.
 You need people
to work the land with you.
 To run the place,
to defend it and you're injured.
 You know, if they chased you again,
could you get away?
 Just talk to them.
 I'll think about it.
 I'd like to take you somewhere.
 My favourite place.
 What we having?
 We came back cos we like you.
 Lenny really likes you.
 You go first, Len. I'll join you.
 Could be the fan belt?
 Nice walk, across the fields.
 Are you OK?
 - Where's the other one?
- Upstairs.
 Come on...
 You fancy me?
 She can't smell it...
 but I can.
 - What?
- Prison.
 You and me in the past,
 we'd never have stood side by side.
 But we can now.
 Now we need to.
 Out.
 Why are we alive?
 Got an easier one?
 Just needed to ask you.
 You wanna be here?
 Come on, then.
 Come on!
 This way.
 Come on.
 Down here.
 You're good.
 Could've been a pro.
 Gone.
 Good luck to them.
 Did that yourself?
 In the Army, years ago.
 Right.
 Come and have a drink.
 What did you do?
 - How do you mean?
- What was your crime?
 Gavin...
 The guy's just looking for trouble.
Typical police.
 - So you're familiar with the police?
- When I was a kid, yeah.
 He sees my potential
and he's threatened.
 So he smells your past.
 He's jealous of what we can do here,
that he can't.
 You and me.
 I thought that too...
 until I saw your prison tattoo.
 I worked for a year
with ex-offenders.
 So what did you do?
 What I did is done.
 It's the past. I thought
you were looking to the future.
 I thought you wanted
to give everybody a chance.
 Be all they can be.
 - How gullible do you think I am?
- I don't think you're gullible at all.
 Presenting yourself
as dependable, attractive.
 You give me a chance,
 and I'll prove myself.
 You should've come clean
about your criminal record.
 I think you'll be
better off elsewhere.
 Your loss.
 Morning.
 You want to know what I did?
 I thought I'd come
and show you before I go.
 No, you don't want me to leave?
 Or no,
you don't want me to kill you?
 Let's go back to our place.
 Negotiation time?
 At the house.
 Are you ready?
 I meant to ask, what does that mean?
 "May there never be an end."
 Schoolboy Latin,
carved it when I was 12.
 "May there never be an end?"
 To the summer.
 To our adventures here.
 You know that stuff's been damaged.
 Disrespected.
 Saw you coming.
 Guys...
 Listen, sorry I've been scaring you.
 Time to talk, yeah?
 Absolutely.
 Come on in.
 TOSSER
 You should sack your cleaner.
 - What are you doing!
- We need to make sure he's not armed!
 We came to talk!
 Search him.
 You see? Concealed weapon.
 He wasn't going to use it.
He can't fight all five of you.
 - He can't now.
- Snared.
 I trusted you!
 She was tricking us, bringing him
here armed. She's on his side!
 You know what? You guys are good.
 Now I'm impressed.
You've taken me out.
 You've won the game.
 It's not a game.
 Agreed.
 Will!
 So come on, then.
 Cut my throat.
 Jimmy, stop!
 Give me my knife.
 Give me my... knife!
 Mum!
 Cushion.
 I want a pan of water to sterilise.
 One of you, upstairs,
bathroom, cupboard,
 top shelf, blue tin, bring it down!
 The blade hit his collarbone.
 Bottom of that bureau,
 my aunt keeps her sewing stuff.
I need needles, thread.
 No-one dies today.
 Now go get me a blanket?
 They're clearing up.
 You could stay.
 The wrong boy.
 We'll find you a car.
 He's sleeping? Is that good?
 - Does it drive OK?
- Yeah, tank's half full.
 - Good man.
- Thanks.
 Be good!
 "May there never be an end."
 Come on, boys. We've got work to do.
 Hello?
 It's our car.
 Over here.
 They've come to take you back.
 We've left.
We didn't like the way they treated you.
 The way they treated me?
 You're right.
You're 100% right to be pissed off.
 I was out of order, mate,
and I got it wrong.
 Won't happen again.
 I'm sorry.
 Are you going back to Greg and Anya?
 And the chickens.
 Come on. Let's go together.
 Oh, am I glad to see you.
 It wasn't Peter.
 A wild goose chase.
 You gonna open
the flipping door, or what?
 - Hello.
- Hi, guys. Come on in.
 - Welcome home.
- How are ya?
 - I missed you.
- I'm starving.
 So good to see you.
 I never thought I'd be pleased
to see you guys again.
 You want to hide God from me again!
 There's nothing for you here.
Do you understand?
 I got the virus, I wasn't immune.
 You're fully dilated,
the baby's ready,
 we're going to be fine. That's it.
 So you just do it
for all the people that you loved.
 Does it matter
who we sleep with, Tom?
