I guess. Mable Pines, you have made me the happiest boy in the world. Are you sniffing my hair? It's not a date, Dip, it's just, you know I didn't want to hurt his feelings. Until he figured it, I'd throw him a bone. Mabel, guys don't work that way. He's gonna fall in love with you. Pff, yeah, right. I'm not THAT lovable. - Kaboom! Yes! - Okay, at least we agree on something here. A night of enchantment awaits, my lady. Oh boy. I can't believe they'd let us bring horse in here. Well, people have hard time saying 'no' to me. Ah! Monsieur Gideon! The feet on the table! An excellent choice! - Jean-Luc, what have we discused about our contac? - Yes, yes. Very good. I've never seen so many forks. And water with bubbles in it?

Now, I hear your niece and my Gideon are well, they are singing in harmony lately, so to speak. Yeah, and I'm against it. No, no, no. I see it as a fantastic business oportunity. Yes, the Mystery Shack and the Tent of Telepathy. We'd been at each other's throats for far.. Let me get that. At each others throats for far too long, yes we have.

How did it go? I don't know.. I have a lobster now.. Well, at least it's over and you will never have to go out with him again. Mabel, it's over, right? Mabel? He asked me out again and I didn't know how to say NO! Like this - NO It's not that easy, Dipper. I do like Gideon, as a friend/little sister. So I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I just need to get things back where they used to be. You know, friends. Boat midnight, boat midnight. You know, I thought dancing would be the end of the evening, right? Don't you want this evening to last my sweet? NO! I mean, yes. I mean, I'm always happy hanging with a friend. Buddy, pal, chump, other word for friend. - Pal? - I already said pal. A mate? How about soulmate? Well, you can't say no to that. He's so nice, but I can't keep doing this. But I can't break his heart. Aaah! I have no way out! - What in the heck happened on that date? - I don't know. I was in the friend-zone and then before I knew what was happening, he pulled me into romance zone! It was like quicksand! Geopardy quicksand! Mabel, come on. It's not like you'll have to marry Gideon. Great news, Mabel. You have to marry Gideon. - What? - It's all a part of my long-term deal with buddy Gleafall. There's a lot of cash tied up in this thin, plus I got this shirt. I am fat. Bodies change, honey! Bodies change. - Oh no, Mabel. - Mabel's not here. - She's in sweater town. - Are you gonna come out of sweater town? All right. Enough is enough. - If you can't break up with Gideon, than I'll do it for you. - You will? - Oh thank you, thank you, thank you - Allright, allright. Hello! Dipper Pines, how are you? - You look good, you look good. - Thanks, you are.. Look, Gideon. We've gotta talk. Mabel isn't joining you tonight. She doesn't want to see you anymore. She's kinda weirded out by you, no offense. So what you're saying is.. - You've come between us. - You're not gonna like freak out or anything, are you? Of course not. This things happen. So, okay cool. Well, then again, sorry man, but uh.. Hey, thumbs up! Thumbs up, indeed my friend. How did it go? Was he mad? Did he try to read your mind with his psychic powers? Don't worry Mable, he's just a kid. He doesn't have any powers. Dipper Pines, you don't know what you've done. You've just made the biggest mistake of your life. Gideon Charles Gleafall, clean up your room this instant. I can buy and sell you old man! Fair enough. Hit me dude! - Feels good. - I'm so glad everything's back to normal. - Your turn. - Your tur.. Aw, man. - Hello? - Toby Determined, Gravity Falls Gossiper. Oh, hey man. Sorry for acusing you of murder last week. Water under the bridge. Saay..

Hello friend. - Gideon. - Dipper Pines. How long have you been lining in this town? Week? Two? You like it here? Enjoying the scenery? - What do you want from me, man? - Listen carefully boy. This town has secrets you couldn't begin to comprehend. Is this about Mabel? I told you, she's not into you. Liar! You turned her agains me! She was my peach dumpling! Are you okay man? Howdy! Reading minds isn't all I can do. But..but you're a fake.. Oh, tell me Dipper. Is this fake? How's your hair tasting buddy? Wendy, I need some advice. - You've broken up with guys, right? - Oh yeah. Russ Toram, Elay Hall, Stoney Davidson. I don't know what's wrong with me. I thought everytrhing was back to normal, but I still feel all gross. Flake Wurly, Nate Halls, oh, the guy with the tattoos. Maybe letting Dipper do it for me was a mistake. Gideon deserves an honest break up Deanny Feldman, Mark Epstin, oh. Oh man, I'm not sure I actualy broke up with him. No wonder he keeps calling me. I know what I gotta do. Thatnls for talking to me, Wendy. Ignore. Grunkle Stan was right about you! You are a monster! Your sister will be mine! - Who's the cute little guy? You are! - No you are! - She's never gonna date you, man! - That's a lie! And I'm gonna make sure you never lie to me again, friend. Gideon! We have to talk! Mabel! My marshmallow! What are you doing here? I'm sorry Gideon, but I can't be your marshmallow. I am here to be honest and tell you that myself. I..I don't understand. Mabel, this probably isn't the best time to be brutaly honest with him! Hey, but we can still be makeover buddies, right? - Woudn't you like that? - Really? No! Not really! - You were like attacking my brother! What the heck? My tie! Give it back! Not so powerfull without this, are you? Dipper! Listen Gideon. It's over. I will never ever date you. Yeah! My powers! Oh, this isn't over. This isn't the last you'll see of lil..ol..me. This is living brother. From now on, it's all named brand foods and clown paintings. - Well hehey Gideon, look what.. - Stanpher Pines! I rebuke thee! I rebuke thee! Rebuke? Is that a word? The entire Pines family have invoked my fury! You will all pay recompense for you transgressions! What, you got like a word-a-day calendar or something? B-but-but but sunshine, what about our arrangement with Mable and.. Silence! Well, I see he's taking one of his rages again. Sorry, Stan. I'll have to stand with Gideon on this one. Okay, okay. I can see when I'm not wanted. Stan, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna need that painting back, Staaan! Stan! Try and catch me, suckers! I could've had it all. What the heck happened to you two? - Gideon. - Gideon. Gideon. Yeah, the little mutant swore vengeance on the whole family. I guess he's gonna nibble my anckles or something. Oh yeah. Yeah! How is he gonna destroy us now, huh? Try to think what number we're thinking of? He'll never guess what number I'm thinking of. Negative 8! Noone would guess a negative number! Oh, look out! Somebody's planning our destruction right now. Gideon, I still love you. If only my family weren't in the way. Look at me. I'm old and I'm smelly. Hey, what are you going to do without your precious amulet? Oh, you'll see boy. You'll see. - You're done. - Not yet. - How about now? - Almost. And.. there. Let's do this. You're all fired.
