 Can you think of any? There are none. And the whole world... they want to look at someone who that has happened to. Everyone just wants to look at you. Everyone wants to judge you stare at you. Look for clues, so maybe it won't happen to them. That's when this began. Two faces. Two Joannas. TITLE MUSIC PLAYS MEDIA CROWD NOISE GAVEL TAPS

 BABY CRIES Jo. Jo, please. BABY CRIES FOOTSTEPS Hi. - Jo. - Hmm? Go to bed. SHE SIGHS WHISPERS: Bye. Bye. ALISTAIR: The... The Minister will speak for two minutes. He'll take four questions, less if off-topic. PHONE VIBRATES Alistair; Henry McCallum. I was wondering if you would care to respond to the article I wrote about the Minister's recent indiscretions? I deal with the true press, not with clicktivists. Welcome to the new world. LAUGHTER Would you agree that the Party Faithful has a right to be informed if one of its executive members is being dishonest? Henry, I'd love to have a chat with you but this is not my stage. Just keeping it warm. LAUGHTER PHONE VIBRATES Morning, Ladies and Gents. Changes to the welfare system have improved the lives of thousands... BABY CRIES I'm at the end of my tether here. ALISTAIR: Sweetheart, you know what today is. There is no way that I can come home right now. Well, you could come home if the house was on fire or if I'd been robbed or murdered! I'm sorry. Can you ring the, the health visitor? She could pop by. No, it's alright, it'll be OK. Oh God, this makes teaching a classroom of five year olds look like a walk in the park at lunch hour alone. I've got to go, I'm sorry. Alright, OK. Go be important. BABY CRIES BABY CRIES CLASS CHATTER OK, are you listening? Just stay very, very, very quietly until they're ready for us, OK? Hi. You must be Miss Lyndsay? Joanna. Joanna Lyndsay, yeah. - Alistair Robertson. - Hi. There's a guy in there, my boss. He just loves reading stories. He has to read one once a day at least or he gets like really cranky. Are you guys cool if you come in and he reads a story to you? CHILDREN: Yeah! OK, go for it. JOANNA LAUGHS They're completely gorgeous. BABY CRIES BABY CRIES TV CHEF:Just give it time. Three hours, even lower four hours but the key is good wine good vegetables, garlic. Just put them together and let them blend together... TV VOLUME INCREASES AS BABY CRIES that transforms its, its original ingredients. It's deep, it's dark, it's rich. BABY CRIES. A deep, dark mahogany. Now, the best bit is just taking the lid of this and... DOOR BUZZES CAMERA CLICKS CAMERA CLICKS CAMERA CLICKS DOOR OPENS How did we do? Good, lots of interest. And uh, performance? Keep your hands on the lectern. I thought I did. They waved about a bit, sort of up, down touching your tie. Just hold on. OK. Thanks. So have you... Have you given any thought to my daughter's situation? I have. There's no way to keep this out of the press so it's about how we manage it. What has happened to your daughter could happen to any family. HE SCOFFS. We have four weeks until the charges are made public. A lifetime. I have a strategy. There's no covering this up. But if we set the agenda and shape the story the way we want we'll be in a much better position to manage it. Families are fragile things. One wrong move, one bad decision and all our lives are changed like that. BABY CRIES BABY CRIES Joanna? BABY CALMS You're OK. GASPS Where is he? It's OK, he's here. JOANNA SIGHS I fell asleep. He was crying. Yeah, he does that... quite a bit. ALISTAIR LAUGHS There. BABY CRIES Did you pick up the passports? Um... No, it was cold. I'll get it tomorrow. It's only a couple of stops on the bus. I know. I'll get it together tomorrow. I'm sure you'll be fine. I know. I see women out with their babies walking round like it's nothing. I never even saw them before Noah. Now I look at them like they're... marathon runners. I just wanna yell out at them, "You're amazing!" You're amazing. CHILDREN PLAYING Hello. Hi. Sorry, have you forgotten something? I.. I did. I actually... I totally forgot to get your phone number. JOANNA LAUGHS Is this really necessary? Yes. "An application to regain full custody" demands substantial evidence "as to the stability of the child's home environment." The mother has all the rights, the father has none. I want my daughter to know who I am. I want to be able to share some part of her childhood before it's too late. Alexandra won't want to give up her daughter. Alexandra took her. She took Chloe from this house and I can't just go and take her back, I... We have to go through this process. And yes, it may be painful and Australia is a long way away but I can't not do it. Hey. You understand, don't you? Yeah. Yeah, of course. As the Court Appointed Psychiatrist I ask questions and you answer them as honestly as you can. There are no right and no wrong answers. So relax. OK. I'd like you to think back to when Noah was born. Can you tell me about that time? Just a bit of a blur. Do you remember it being a happy time? Yeah. Yeah, sure. A new baby can be overwhelming. People cope in different ways. Do you remember those days? Joanna. Jane... from mother's group? Yeah. Hi, how are you? Great. How are you? Yeah, great. Good, thank you. Wow, he's fully wrapped up. Plus a hat. How many layers have you got him in there? Is he not hot? Uh, he... um... He feels the cold. I haven't seen you for a few weeks. Yeah, I've been busy. Um, I'd better... I'd better get going. - Bye. - Bye. PHONE RINGING Hello. ALEXANDRA: I got your number from Liz. I know you'll all be here soon. Chloe's so excited to meet her brother, half-brother. Alex. I'll get to the point. I don't have enough money to fight Alistair in the Court system but I can't lose my daughter. I won't. Alex, you took Chloe. Alistair hasn't seen her in years. Yes, yeah. We all know why I left Scotland and I took my daughter because I'm her mother. Alex, what do you want? I thought now that you've had... a baby and congratulations on that, by the way... ALEXANDRA: That you'd understand why I left and why I had to take my daughter with me. I mean, can you imagine having your child taken from you? Having to give him up? I know he's only a baby, but... trust me, that bond only gets stronger. Where is he from? He's Australian. - He's Australian. - THEY GIGGLE. And you're sure that he's not married? He's not married. He isn't married, no. For god's sake, he's not married. He's just... Oh! THEY LAUGH SIRENS WAIL JOANNA: I'm going to his house tomorrow. I insisted. Oh, he's wearing my bib. Yeah, it's his going out bib. THEY LAUGH It's very cute. Could I get a latte and a turkey salad, please? - Yes. - God, I'm eating cake. Looks nice. So it's booked, we're going. Wow, that's wonderful. A whole 24 hours on a flight with this one first. I'm sure you'll get through it. And summer in Australia and you'll have granny to look after the baby. Yeah, well it's not just a holiday. Alistair is trying to get Chloe back. To come and live here, with you? Uh-huh. Yeah. And is that what you want? What? To become a stepmother to a teenage girl? Do I have a choice? No. How old is she? Chloe is fourteen. - Ooh... - What? I'm just remembering what I was like at fourteen. Yeah, well, I'm the dreaded stepmother. PHONE BLEEPS I'm sorry, can I get that to go? I've really got to get back. You can always come to the salon if you want? No, no, no. You, you go. We've got some things to pick up. He's so adorable. He's not a puppy. Oh God, sorry. I'm tired. I don't think I've had more than two hours sleep for weeks. Really? Doesn't Alistair get up sometimes? Uh-uh, he's working, he needs his sleep. Anyway, I have the boobs. But you have to sleep too. You know, this is work. He earns the money, he wears the earplugs. That doesn't seem fair. Look, I really have to go. - Bye. - Bye. Say bye. BABY CRIES This is the hallway, there's a piano there. I play that all the time. And this... this is the bedroom. Uh-huh. Hey. I only have twenty five minutes. Me too. HE MUMBLES - JOANNA GIGGLES Chloe. FOOTSTEPS Well, the pool was closed and we didn't know... for cleaning. ALISTAIR: Alex. ALISTAIR CHUCKLES Do you wanna get dry? Let's get dry. It'll be cold, just for a second. BABY GURGLES. ALISTAIR COOS OVER BABY Oh, I forgot about... Can I help? Uh, no. I'm alright, thanks. KIRSTY: Jo, are you OK? You seem a bit out of sorts. I'm about to take a new-born on a thirty-hour flight and my back is giving me grief again. Aren't I allowed to be slightly ruffled? Just stop asking me if I'm OK all of the time. OK, let's skedaddle. Come here. Come here, good boy. We'll get through it. - See you soon. - Safe travels. Bye, Alistair. INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO KIRSTY: Yes, I was with them the day they left. MORTEN: Would you say Joanna was looking forward to her trip to Australia? Yes. Relaxed, happy, in control? Yes. The passenger statements we've heard here today paint a very different picture, don't they? Joanna was looking forward to going to Australia. Nobody looks forward to flying all that way with a new baby. MORTEN: Least of all, the other passengers. You see, I find it odd that your memory of Joanna and Alistair at this time is so different from the psychiatrist's report. How do you account for that? I'm not a doctor. I wasn't looking for problems. Life isn't always easy and having a new baby is certainly testing but Joanna... she was amazing. MORVEN: No more questions, My Lord. SEATBELT WARNING DINGS BABY CRIES JOANNA: Ssh, ssh... Ssh... BABY CRIES LOUDER PASSENGER: Please, shut up. BABY CRIES PASSENGER CHATTER Try feeding the poor thing. Ssh, ssh... BABY CRIES Please, stop it. Noah, please stop it. Please stop it. RUNNING WATER DOOR SLAM Al! Al! SHE PANTS I came as quickly as I could. Are you alright? SIGHS I came back from work and they were gone. I rang the police, the airport. Can she just take her? I don't know. I don't know. But she's gone. HE SOBS: Jo, I'm sorry. HE SOBS But then my marriage it was over. It was over long ago but when you have a child, leaving, it's just... HE SIGHS It's huge. I fell in love with you and that is no lie. BABY CRIES - Shh. Hi. Bab's not settling? No, sorry. I'm sorry. BABY CRIES There's been a number of complaints. Is there something you can do to stop him crying? Passengers are trying to sleep. Yeah. Have you got a bottle or something? Look, I'm not doing this on purpose, believe me. MALE: Trying giving it some scotch. Was it you? Smart mouth that made the complaint with nothing to do but sit and read for the next twelve hours. SHE SHOUTS: Would you like to have a go? STEWARDESS: Lower your voice. Would you like to take him and have a go? If there is anybody, anybody here who thinks they can help me out I would be more than fucking grateful. You bunch of stuck-up arse wipes! Jo, Jo! I have the health visitor's notes from your postnatal visits here. Health visitor? No, I don't remember seeing anybody. You attended three appointments at the Baby Health Clinic at the Royal Infirmary. Oh that, yeah. They... they measured him and weighed him, yeah. These are copies of the postnatal screening questions. Is that your handwriting and your signature? Yes. There's nothing in your responses which would indicate the feelings of not coping. All the other mums looked happy. I couldn't walk in there and say, "I'm sorry." Don't think I'm very good at this." I thought everyone just ticked the boxes. So you would say that you weren't coping? I suppose not. I don't know. Did you ever have thoughts of wanting to escape? Yes. Yes. Doesn't everyone? Can we have some water, please? Thank you. Ssh, ssh, ssh... I'm getting you some water. Why would somebody complain? People are so horrible. I'm sorry, I should've woken up. I can sleep through anything. BABY CRIES - How's your back? - Awful. Ssh, ssh, ssh... There you go. Thank you so much. Can we also, can we get this heated up, please? Thank you. SHE SIGHS - Get some sleep, OK? - OK. Did you feel that you were adequately supported? What do you mean? Your fiancé? Family, neighbours... friends? I didn't know what to do. I had no one to show me. Your mother died when you were...? Uh, fifteen. Um, and Alistair's mother she was on the other side of the world. Ancient history. BABY CRIES Ssh... BABY CRIES Would you like me to take him for a bit? Thank you so much. You need a break. Come on, my sweetheart, that's it. Careful now. Thank you. Sorry. BABY CRIES Ssh, it's alright... It's alright. It's alright. I think he's teething. I think you're right. Here we go. There you are. BABY CRIES PA SYSTEM BEEPS. INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT Hello. Welcome to Melbourne. STEWARDESS: Under the seat in front of you or in the overhead bins. - Is he OK? - He's good. Ah, it's over. Uh-huh. They wanted to wake you for breakfast but I let you sleep. I nicked this for you though. Thank you. ALISTAIR: Oh shit. JOANNA: What is it? ALISTAIR: Ah, I need a coffee. JOANNA: I'll get us one. I forgot how shitty jetlag feels. You slept almost the whole way. Jetlag's not caused by lack of sleep. You know that, right? AIRPORT ANNOUNCEMENTS SEAGULLS SQUAWK DOOR OPENS CHLOE: Mum! DOOR SLAMS Yep. Hi. How was your day? What'd you do today? Schoolwork, mum. Boring, stupid schoolwork. Your counsellor thinks it's a good idea. Stick with it. None of my friends are there. OK, no one else has to do this in the holidays. Chloe... you are on such thin ice at school and if you get expelled... If you are, listen... Trust me, it's going to be really bad for your life. There are no other schools in this area. You'd be lucky to get a job in a shop. Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do, Chloe. CHLOE, UNDER HER BREATH: Here we go. Excuse me? You know that's just, that's life. Yeah, your life. Yeah, could you not be rude to me, please? I'm dealing with a lot at the moment. I'm not going, mum. I don't care if the Court tells me to. I'm not going to live in horrible Scotland. They can't make me go... Can they? Not if I have anything to do with it. I was thinking about that day. The day that they walked in on us in the apartment. What? Why did you take me to your home? JOANNA: It was such a dangerous thing to do. I could've... I could've seen one of Chloe's toys or Alexandra's clothes or gone into the bathroom and... seen that a woman had lived there. And... And you're just thinking about this now? Yeah. Can you remember what you were thinking? Um... I was thinking I could get away with it. JOANNA SCREAMS MIDWIFE: That's it, well done, Joanna. That's your baby's head born, Joanna. Well done. JOANNA SCREAMS MIDWIFE: That's it, keep pushing. Well done. HEAVY BREATHING ALISTAIR GIGGLES BABY CRIES FOOTSTEPS CAR BEEPS - Hey. - Hi. ELIZABETH: That looks delicious. Thanks, I made it myself. Clever girl. How are you? Do you want to come in for a cup of tea? They're not here. They're going straight to the cottage to change to unpack before they come here. Mrs Wilson's? Are they not staying here? They wanted a place of their own, you know. It's their holiday. Tea? I'm just gonna push off. I've got a bit of running around to do this afternoon. I'm gonna come and pick you up later. Chloe, can you just run inside so I can have a talk to your nan? About me? Not necessarily. Well why can't I stay? I mean, I should be able to hear what you say about me. Do as your mum says and keep an ear out for the phone in case your dad calls. I wish I had that power. I'm not sure if you're aware that Alistair wants custody of Chloe. He's hired lawyers. ELIZABETH SIGHS I'm sorry if I'm telling you things you already know. Sorry. I'll, um, get going. ELIZABETH: Alex. He did tell me. I just think with all the trouble that she's having at school at the moment... She's fourteen. I was fourteen once. I certainly didn't hit my teachers. I just think a change would be good for her. She's my daughter, my only child. I won't hand her to another woman to be raised. CAR DOOR SLAMS You know if he wins, she'll be living in Scotland and you won't see her any more than I will. CAR ENGINE STARTS No bars at all. Maybe if you see a hill or something? You know, you'll be more like a big sister than a stepmom to Chloe. What about Alexandra? Seriously, she's had her long enough. It's only fair that we get her... for a while. You know, the next few years of her life will be crucial. I worry about her wasting away in this backwater. You grew up in this backwater; It didn't do you much harm. It's a little different my upbringing and Chloe's at the moment. She's being raised by a single mother who can't hold down a job who drinks herself stupid most nights. Al, you don't know that. My lawyer does. What? She's made connections with her neighbours her old places of employment. If we have any chance of getting Chloe back we have to prove Alexandra is an unfit mother. Yeah, I know. I know. It's just so cruel. Well, so is stealing her out of the country while I was at work. She's my daughter. I have to fight for her. INDISTINCT CHATTER. SEA BIRDS SQUAWK TRAFFIC NOISE Hello? FOOTSTEPS APPROACH Alex. Hi. Sorry, the... the front door was open so... They're not here yet. I'm still cleaning. Right ho. I'm gonna... Anyway, thank you. Sorry. MEDIA CROWD CHATTERS FEMALE REPORTER: Joanna, can we talk to you for a moment? POLICEMAN: Stand back for me, please. This is an active investigation. FEMALE REPORTER: Joanna? What's that smell? Eucalyptus burning, it's smoke. Is that where we're headed? Let's see. RADIO: And they seem to be burning against the wind travelling in a south easterly direction so this bushfire is dangerous and burning out of control. The CFS are warning there is a risk to lives and property and if you're in this area, you are in danger. You must act immediately and follow your bushfire survival plan. Do not leave or enter the area in a vehicle or on foot. It is too late and the roads will not be safe... ' It sounds a fair way off from us still. Too late - what does that mean, that you're gonna die? No, no. It means... It means it would be safer to stay at home rather than risk trying to leave. Al, is it safe to be driving? Of course. We'll be fine. Hey there. - Dad. Hey, can you tell mum, nanna that we're a couple of hours away. I'll give her a call when we get to the cottage. Yeah, OK. I'm really looking forward to seeing you. We just saw a fair bit of smoke here. Is there any there? We're gonna have a rest when we get to the cottage and maybe get something to eat. I'll give you a buzz when we're ready to come over, OK? How's my brother? He's fabulous. He told me he can't wait to see you too. CHLOE SARCASTICALLY: Ha, ha, ha! OK. I'll see you soon. - Bye. Love you. Bye. PHONE RINGS Hey. Hey, so they've landed but they're coming over to nan's after they've had a nap so they won't be here till later tonight. Can I please stay the night? Nanna said yes. Sure. I'll pick you up tomorrow? CHLOE: Bye. MRS WILSON: Ahoy! Ssh... Found the key then? I forgot to get some milk in for you. WHISPERS: Thank you, that's so thoughtful. Yes, I found the key. I'm... I'm Alistair and this is Joanna. Oh, I know who you are. I know your mum. SHE LAUGHS. How old is your baby? JOANNA: Three months and seventeen days. We're... We're pretty exhausted, Mrs Wilson. Thank you for the milk. JOANNA GASPS HEATING You know, it's just... it's plane food. Can I get her anything? No, I'll let you know. Thank you. MORTEN: Can you tell the Court... about the day you were preparing the cottage for Joanna and Alistair's visit? MRS WILSON: I was cleaning and... I popped back to my house to get some cloths and when I got back, I found Alexandra inside the cottage. Did she say what she was doing there? MRS WILSON: I assumed she'd come to visit them but she was there too early. I never thought about it until later. MORVEN: When you told the police? Yes. They interviewed me quite a few times.

There are none. And the whole world they want to look at someone who that has happened to. Everyone just wants to look at you. Everyone wants to judge you stare at you. Look for clues so maybe it won't happen to them. - Hi. - Hi. It's just me tonight so I may as well eat in. Can I just use your loo? Yeah, sure. Thanks. POLICE SIRENS BLARE WOMAN: There's police down on Eloura Street. They just shut it off, you can't get through. SIRENS WAIL I didn't know it then but that's when this began. Two faces. Two Joannas. DR. WALLACE: I was appointed by the Crown to ascertain if Joanna Lyndsay was of sound mind and therefore capable of standing trial. Can you give the Jury a summary of your assessment? My conclusion is that Joanna Lyndsay is psychologically capable of understanding what is happening to her today. Her past trauma is severe and undeniable but I believe that she is of sound mind. No more questions, My Lord. JOANNA: My face. I used to be able to... hide behind it. Then it was like my face became a magazine. Anyone could thumb through. Jo. Jo. Jo, he's gone! ALISTAIR: Call the police, our baby's gone. Call the police! Jo, come on! Help! Have you seen anyone holding a baby? Call the police. Help! I've lost my child!

No, that's good. Are you OK? Uh-huh. DOOR KNOCKS - MAN: Five minutes. Thank you. MAN: Just the last checks, guys, last checks. MAN 2: Camera position, please. Do we have clarity? WOMAN: It's still a bit shiny, just... WOMAN: Can I see a close-up of Joanna and Alistair, please. Do you think you might cry? That was when the freak show began.
