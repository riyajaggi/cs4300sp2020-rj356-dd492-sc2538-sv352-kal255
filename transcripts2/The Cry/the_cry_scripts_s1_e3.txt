 And after I leave the car, you count... I count to sixty and then I come into the shop. Why are you coming into the shop? I forgot something. Do you shut the car door? Yes, I shut it. Hey there. Hey, can you tell mum, nanna, we're a couple of hours away. I'll call her when we get to the cottage. I'm really looking forward to seeing you. We just saw a fair bit of smoke here.

 Noah! Jo? What's wrong? - What's wrong? - He's... He's cold. - Is he breathing? - I don't know. There's no pulse. When did he stop breathing? I don't know, I don't know. How long's he been like this? I don't know. What happened, you checked him just then? Yes, I just checked him. I opened the door I checked him and he's cold. He feels really... He's not... he's not breathing. Jo! Jo. - Give him to me. - No. Give him. Jo! Jo! Jo, just get in the car. We'll call for help. Did you buckle him in? You should buckle him in, he has to be buckled in. He... you have to buckle him in. Alexandra's been arrested for kidnapping Noah. We conducted a search and found something of Noah's at your mum's house. No. No, no, no, no... What? Chloe, I understand how upsetting this is but we're going to have to ask you some questions now. This was my fault. No, no, no, no... Dad, I took something out of Joanna's bag. I had her bag and I just took it. Dad. Thanks, Chloe. Here you go. It wasn't mum. What did it look like, Chloe? It was blue. It had little white stripes. Will you let her go? It was my fault, I'm sorry. Shame on you. Noah's out there somewhere and you waste this precious time trying to frame a single mother a jilted ex who occasionally likes a glass of wine who runs every day to stay strong for her kid! You could jail half the women in this town under forty if that were a crime! Alexandra, I know this hasn't been easy on you. But we're doing everything we can to find out what happened to Noah. Everyone in this town now looks at me like a child killer, Peter. You know what they're like. - Thanks. - See you later, Dad. See you soon. Hey. I'm sorry you had to go through that. I never thought you'd hurt him, Alex. Oh, thank you. Alistair, you're the world's best liar. You always have been. What happened? Tell me, what happened? I... I um... I just, I re... I reached in for him and um... He... He wasn't cold, he was just... He was just still. When? When? When was he last awake? I don't know. In the plane, when we got off the plane? When was he last awake? I don't know, he was... He cried for the whole flight. He... he... I think he... he was... He was tired, he just, he fell asleep. Did you hold him? OK, the trolley, the... The capsule... The capsule was in the trolley on the... on the... with the luggage. We went to the car hire desk. I got us... I got us coffee. Jo, the medicine. What? Your medicine, Noah's medicine, they were in the same clear bottles. No, no. I... I tasted it. Mine... I tasted it bef... I tasted it before I gave it to him. Mine, it tastes different. You were exhausted and you were out of your mind on that flight. I forgot to get some milk in for you. Thank you, that's very thoughtful of you. How old is your baby? Three months and seventeen days. We're really exhausted, Mrs Wilson. Thank you for the milk. You know, it's just, it's plane food. Can I get her anything? No, I'll let you know. I'm just next door. Great. Great, thank you. Why don't you put him down? Alistair, we should go to the police. We should go to the police. Jo... You'll be charged for manslaughter. Do you understand? You'll go to prison. I will never get Chloe. Our lives will be destroyed. I don't care. I don't care. No, listen... listen to me. You don't deserve to be punished for this. You don't deserve to be punished for this because the world... the world will not agree with me. But you and me together, we can make our own way through this. Do you trust me? Yes. I know we can do this. I know it. But you must trust me and we must do it together, OK? You can't abandon this. You can't abandon me on this, OK? Hi. Peter will be here in a moment. Hi. I um, I came in as soon as I got the message. - Thanks Alistair. - What is it? We just wanted to run over some of the details of the afternoon when you arrived in Melbourne. We'll record this. So um... Am I the suspect now? It's just some questions. So you arrived at the cottage at about four thirty. What did you do during that time? Er... Ok, uh... I unpacked had a shower, put on some washing checked some emails, had a nap for about an hour. I had something to eat. All Noah's clothes and blankets and the covers for the baby capsule were washed. Yes, yeah, I think so. And you both stayed at the cottage until you left to go to Elizabeth's? Yes. Did you put Noah into the travel cot? Uh... possibly. Did you change his nappy? Probably. You said you had something to eat at the cottage. - Yes. - What did you have to eat? What... what did I have to eat? A sandwich, or something. That night is a blur, I'm sorry. Have you found something? Do you know something? There's no physical evidence of Noah at the cottage. So... so you have no leads? Your investigation's stalled and now you turn on us? OK, can... Can I ask you to be very careful when speaking with Joanna that you... that you don't push her? OK? Alistair? Please, I have nothing to say. I wish I did. Alistair, did you kill your son? Excuse me. Jo? Jo? Jo. Come on, wake up. - Sleeping is better. - Jo? Jo, wake up. Come on, wake up! Just leave me... Just leave me. Oh, fuck off. Oh, fuck off, Jesus Christ. Hi, have you got the draft of the article? Yeah, it's good, thanks. Look, um... I'm really worried about the competency of this investigation. Something needs to be said. Publish? - It's up to you. But I can have no connection, OK? I need them on my side. Hang in there, yeah. Thanks, mate. Bye. - Where is it? - Jo. - Where is it? - Jo. Alistair, where have you put it? Jo, I'm sure whatever it is, we'll find it. It's all I have! Mum, do you wanna just give us a moment? - Sure. - Thank you. You can't keep it, it has the medicine on it. The police know it's missing, don't be an idiot. Alistair, I need it. Give it to me. You're not ten years old. What you need is to take a step back and think very carefully about your next move. Joanna. Joanna? Are you OK? Alex. Come. A bit early for a swim. Is everything alright? I think so. I'm sorry. You were arrested, that must have been... horrible. Yeah, it was. Chloe was really shaken. She's a great girl. She is. Alistair wants her to go and live with you. Do you want that? I mean, honestly? She's a teenage girl. I know fathers are important, but she needs her mum. When Alistair wants something he'll crush anything and anyone... to get it. That's what frightens me. He's so very manipulating of people. He did it to me. I never realised until I was out of it. Joanna. Be careful. The triangle: Can you explain to the Court what you mean? Joanna, Alistair and myself. It was a toxic set of relationships. I was... I was very frightened that I was going to lose my daughter. I was determined to do anything in my power to keep Chloe with me. How did Joanna and Alistair react after you were arrested? It was a nightmare for me. I was furious. He appeared to have gotten what he wanted. What is this? They have a search warrant. Where have you been? I went for a walk. I didn't know where you were. Don't do that again. They've finished inside, we'll move round to the back garden. What's the justification for this? We had a call from a neighbour who heard a baby crying. Really? We should've done this weeks ago. "Questions have been raised about the competency" of the Australian investigation. Of particular concern is the lack of crime scene evidence from the site of Noah's abduction the possible loss of crucial evidence from the hire car "being moved before forensics arrived." Yes. McCallum, you're worth every penny. Who pays him? I pay him, to make the cops look bad. I don't think a neighbour called the station. I think they just wanted to search the house. That's nice. Are you taking it with you today? I think he looks sad in this one. Please. Just give me your best for this TV interview. Give me your best today. We need it. Take a couple of these, they'll relax you. No, I don't want them, I don't need them. Let's go sit in the sun for a bit. Sure. I've been thinking about that day on the plane. I know I did a taste test, I know it. Because there was this lady sat behind me she asked me what I was doing and I explained it to her. What if it was something else? You can't trust your memory. You were exhausted and stressed on the plane you were out of your head with fatigue. But if it was something else I mean he was always crying. Hmm? Maybe he had a... I don't know, a condition we didn't know about. - It's too late, Jo. - Is it? Why? We could go to Peter. We could tell him the whole truth. Maybe they could do an autopsy on Noah and they could tell us. Alistair, they could tell us what truly happened to him. We are way past that point, Jo. Are we? Why? Why? We would be hammered if it was revealed we'd lied and fabricated Noah's disappearance. We would face charges: Perjury, lying to the police. Think it through. We should've gone to the police. We were exhausted and in shock but what's done is done. Now we need to keep looking forward. You know... You know that I'll never ever blame you. Thank you. Now, this interview today. It'll get the focus back on the search for Noah and off us. The press, the public, everyone needs to be looking for him. Are you up for it? I think I can do it. With your help. OK. Where is he? There's a beach not far from here. I used to go when I was a kid. There was this amazing tree there. I used to think it was a magic tree. And the tree was still there? Yes, it's still there. Is it beautiful? Yes, it's beautiful. Al... There's no turning back now. You understand that, don't you? Now we're about to go in. Sorry, one sec. Excuse me. Hi, can you um... can you dial back the eyes? It's just a bit heavy and waterproof as much of it as possible? Thank you. So that's the moment you realised your four month old son was gone vanished from the back of your car. Can you recall what you were thinking in that moment? I um... I was thinking. "What, where is he?" to absolute terror. Like sliding down a mountain. I just, I kept just saying to myself over and over. Where is he? Where is he?' But do the police have any leads or any idea what has happened to your baby son? Well, this is what's so hard, a baby can't just disappear. Someone somewhere knows what happened to him. Knows where he is. I'd like to ask you how you're coping with the allegations that you had something to do with your son's disappearance? We can't stop people thinking what they want but what's most upsetting is it takes away from the search for our boy. That's where we want to see the energy of the press and the police. Can I... Can I say something? Of course. Um.. I just want to say something to whoever has Noah. Firstly, I um... I want to say thank you for looking after him. But he is our son and our lives are destroyed by your actions. If you... sorry... If you have him or if you know of anybody who has him, please please let him come home to us. We will never stop looking for Noah. We will never stop believing that he's out there and that he will return to us. How can I leave? How can I leave if I don't know where he is. How can I go home? I can't. I can't, I can't ever leave. Sorry. OK, can we stop now, please? You went off script with that "How can I ever leave the country?" I wasn't acting. We can check into the hotel, then I thought we might get something to eat. Is it far? I might walk. Alright, but what if you're recognised? Jean-Louise? Jean-Louise Talbot, she's our publicist. She does work for me back home for the party. I wasn't aware we had such a thing. She contacted me a week or so ago, asked if she could help. That's what she does. So why didn't you tell me about her? To be honest, I don't know. She organised this interview negotiated the fee. We get paid for that? Yes, of course. To help... pay for the journalists who write the articles. That's right, while my job's on hold, there's no money coming in. We still have the mortgage and expenses. After that interview, Alistair, our faces are gonna be known even more. A new story will come along and we'll be old news. Alistair, look! Look at what's happening. OK, I am trying to do my best for us. I'm trying to hold it all together. But don't forget you're not the only one mourning. - My son is dead. - Because of me. - I didn't say that. - Yes. You did. Hey. I smuggled this in. There's no vase in the hotel room. OK, I'll get one. You don't have to fix... everything. It's a fucking vase. Jo, what do you want me to do? I want to tell the truth. That is what I want. Well, I'm sorry. This is my life. I like my life, I don't wanna go to jail. That's not my story and I don't deserve it. And I do? Don't I? Do you know what I realised? I'll never ever be able to talk about this... honestly, to anybody... ever. For the rest of my life, I am gonna have to... carry this. You can talk to me, Jo. OK, can you promise me that you won't do anything without talking to me and telling me first? We are in this together. OK. OK. God, how good is it to talk without thinking someone's listening in? I'm still worried. What are you worried about? Peter and Lorna were asking questions about what we did at the cottage. And...? Why were there no nappies in the rubbish bin? "What did we eat?" For god's sake. - What did you say? - I was vague. I said, "A sandwich or something." I should have said that we used the barbecue. I cleaned it, every little bit of ash was in the ground. Yes, but Mrs Wilson told police she always leaves the barbecue set and ready to go. Ours was empty of wood. If it comes up we say that we used it and cleaned it and that you took the nappies and you put them in a rubbish bin in town. There is nothing to celebrate. - Where is it? - What? The bib. I got rid of it. - No. - Yes. Alistair, you promised me. You promised me, where is it, Alistair? I'm sorry. Where is it? I'm sorry, it had to go. It had to, it's gone. It doesn't exist. It was all I had! It was all I had left. How could you be so fucking cruel? You are the most ungrateful person I've ever met. Really? What, am I supposed to thank you? Well, actually... yes. You know your problem? You're poisonous. Get out. Get out. Take some flowers to your mum! Hey. Hello. Is she home? No. She's got netball practice. Well um, maybe I could wait? We could talk. It's about time we had a proper, open talk about things. Something for you? This kitchen. Same kettle. Where did we get it? A garage sale in Lorne, I think. Lorne, yeah. Why were we there? What did you want to discuss? Sorry. I was just trying to see what having a normal conversation felt like again. How's Joanna? She's very strong, but I'm worried about her. How are you? The police turned this house upside down tipped out every drawer, every cupboard. Now everyone looks at me like I'm a criminal. That sound... It sounds like home. We had a good thing going on here, didn't we? Remind me why we left here? You were offered a job in Scotland. Imagine if I'd said no to that job if we'd stayed here raised Chloe maybe had another baby or two. You always wanted three didn't you? It wasn't Scotland that broke us up, Al. It was your affairs and your constant lying. That would have happened anywhere in the world. Here we are going to Court to fight for custody. I can offer her a terrific education private school, she can have access to any university in Europe. She's all I've got. I wouldn't know who I was without her. No, see here's the thing. What any good parent would do... is put Chloe's best interests ahead of their fear of being alone. I think you should leave. I'm waiting for Chloe. Well, I don't want you here. Is this some fantasy of yours, is it? Telling me to get out of your house. The house, mind you bought with my parents' deposit. Well, go on. Go on, do it. Do it! Get out of my house, Al! Mind you finish that off before dinner. Fuck off! You're both in a terrible situation. What are the police saying? Nothing yet, loads of people think we did it. Idiots. Kirsty. He's dead. He's dead and it's my fault. For God's sake, Jo. You can't do this to yourself. Noah's alive. I know he is. You can't give up hope. He was wearing a blue grow suit like this one. Whoever has him, please give him back to us. I have made an examination of both. Joanna and Alistair at the press conference. At 2:55, the female rubs her nose indicating that what she's about to say is not true. We miss him so much. "At 3:05" the male's left arm can be seen squeezing the female's left shoulder. His action could constitute a tapping... Shut up, shut up. And signal to the female." We need him home safe. Please help us find him. "Oh my God." Please help us find him. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! These aren't in here. I knocked I thought you were in here. You can't be in here. Sorry, it was... it was open. You can't be in here. Do you wanna see me? What do you wanna see me about? I was just um... I was hoping for an update. I will call you as soon as I have any leads or news, OK? I mean, what are you guys actually doing? I mean, arresting poor Alex. She's absolutely devastated. We are doing everything that we can, alright. We're hoping the 60 Minutes interview is going to bring somebody forward. What happened to him, Pete? What happened to him? Alistair go home and take care of Jo. You're not gonna give up, are you? You're not gonna give up looking for him? This investigation is going to stay open until we have no leads to follow up on. Until then, it's staying open. We're not giving up. Thank you, Pete. No, Al, plea... Jo. Can you come here, please? Come and watch the interview. No, thanks. It's important, you need to watch it. No. You need to stop telling me what to say, do and think every second! And you need to stop lying to me. You are out of control, Jo. I want to see where he's buried. - You need to tell me. - Stop! Be very careful, Jo. I should never have given him to you. I was a coward. You were a partnership a relationship that was under a huge amount of stress but that doesn't explain what changed between you and Alistair. I woke up. Can you talk about what you mean by that? Back in Australia, I... suddenly saw through all the lies the manipulation. The only way to cope with it was to put on a mask. For him. For the world. What lies are you talking about? I was betrayed. That's enough for you to know. Call the inditement of Her Majesty's Advocate against Joanna Louise Lyndsay. Are you Joanna Louise Lyndsay? Yes. I appear on behalf of the panel. Joanna Louise Lyndsay who pleads "Not Guilty" to the inditement being a single charge of the murder of Alistair Jonathan Robertson.
