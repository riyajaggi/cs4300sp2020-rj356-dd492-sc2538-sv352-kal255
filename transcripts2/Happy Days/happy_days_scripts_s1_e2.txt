 ♪ Sha-boom, sha-boom ♪ Da-da-da-da-da-da ♪ Then blink your lights! Come on, get a waitress over here. In broad daylight? Hey, Fonzie. Hi. It's his folks' car. Heh heh heh! Let's go inside and eat. I can't stand being insulted on an empty stomach. Hey, Trudy. Betty. Hi, fellas. Well, how was the funeral? How 'bout a burger and a malt? Uh... Hey, girls, how about a ride home? OK. Sure. We could take you home. Yeah. In that? Thanks, but it might not be going in our direction. Yeah. We're going forward. (horn honks) This is a good, strong car. How do they think we got here? Come on, Rich. Who you thinking about taking to the sock hop? Probably just my socks unless I can find some wheels. Listen, why don't you just take your parents' car? They won't let me use it since I tore the window out at the drive-in. Remember, before you pull out, take the speaker off. I suppose we could just take the bus. Sure. You ever tried to tell a girl's mother your bus ran out of gas? We gotta buy some wheels. Hey, how much money you got? All I have is $100 in my savings. Hey, we could go 50/50. I got 75. That's 50/50? You can keep the spare tire at your house. Come on. You think my father would let me touch my savings for a car? Talk him into it. Use psychology. Tell him if he doesn't let you get a car, you won't eat for a whole day. I couldn't do that. Why?! I get a headache if I don't eat. Oh, Rich. Watch him. Watch him. Look out, ref. He's pulling his hair. Give him the elbow... Daddy! Joanie, I'm so sorry, sweetheart. But that other guy had a fistful of Gorgeous George's curls. Howard, what happened? Daddy dented my whole body. Oh. Daddy didn't mean it, dear. But you should know not to sit close to Daddy when wrestling is on. I'm sorry, sweetheart. Marion, this'll be over in one more fall. Come and help me in the kitchen, dear, or you'll be the last fall. Dad... Look out. Look out. He's rubbing soap in his eyes. What's the matter with you, ref? Are you blind?! Ah, turn it off, will ya, Richie? Dad, there's something I'd like to... Those guys aren't athletes. They're actors. The whole thing is phony. The only real person on that whole screen is Hatpin Mary. (sighs) Here, Dad. What is it, Richard? Well, Dad, I'm 17, and I think it's time that I learned responsibility. You want to work in the store? No. I was thinking more along the lines of, uh, transportation. You want to work on a train? I wanna buy a car. Oh, Richard. What do you want a car for? For lots of things... For running errands for Mom. Going necking. I'm sure that's not what Richard wants the car for, Joanie. Mom! Mom! Richie's gonna buy a car! Tell me something. Where do you plan to get the money to buy this rolling den of iniquity? Oh. Well, see, uh, Potsie and I are gonna go in on it together. We've got, uh... (softly) $175. How much? $175. I always wanted a Cadillac in the family. It would be nice to have a second car, Howard. David and Ricky don't have cars. Beaver doesn't have a car. Now, why should our son be any different? Dad, I know it would be a big responsibility, but that's what you're always saying I need. It'd help me mature, learn how to take care of things. You're gonna be depending on me someday, you know. Don't threaten me, Richard. Howard, at least listen to what he has to say. Me listen? Hah! You know, when I was a kid, my mother used to tell me to listen to my father. Now that I'm a father, my wife tells me to listen to my kids. A lot of boys Richard's age have their own cars. Let's just forget I ever brought it up. Look, Richard, you're old enough to make your own decisions. All I can do is offer you advice. I suggest that you finish high school and college, get yourself a job, and then you'll have enough money to buy yourself a decent car. That's my opinion. But you weigh the pros and the cons, and I'll go along with whatever you decide. Terrific. I'm gonna call Potsie and tell him we can get the car! I'm glad he's not rushing into this. Well, Dad, isn't it a beaut?! I'm speechless. Pretty neat, huh, Mr. C.? How much did the dealer pay you to take it off his hands? We paid 175 for it. Yeah, it was 225, but the guy let us have a break on it. Yeah. He sure let you have it, all right. How do you like the eagle? Looks like he's waiting for a chance to jump off. That was the best part of the deal. The eagle probably cost as much as the car. Oh, I believe that. Tell me something, aren't these tires a little thin? Yeah. It'll be great for peeling out. Peeling out? He means pulling out... Safe and slow, just like you're always telling us. They don't make them like this anymore. Oh, they stopped? This is really a solid car. (horn honking) (honking continues) (honking stops) Horn works. I noticed it. Wait till you hear the motor. You mean to tell me there's something more to this car than just its good looks? Your dad has some sense of humor. Go on, Dad. Get in and start it up. Yeah, come on. All right. All right. (handle jiggles) Is this a combination lock? Oh, no. Wait, wait. There you go. (sighs) Richie, don't you find it a little hard steering this way? Hey, we have Nash seats. Isn't that great?! Talk about luck. Howard? Is that you, Marion? Why are you lying in the boys' car? I just thought it would be a nice change from sitting. This is a very interesting car. (Joanie) That's a Nash seat. That's very good, Joanie. Yeah, I know all about that. That's called the make-out seat. Dear, I'm sure that's not why those nice people at Nash invented that seat. Maybe not, but that's what it's used for. Well, it comes in very handy... if guests stay over. Richie got a phone call from a girl. Who called? Someone named Betty. She heard that you and Potsie got a car. She wants you to meet her and someone named Trudy at Arnold's. Our own wheels, Betty and Trudy and a Nash seat. Man, oh, man, we got it made in the shade! Let's go, Rich! You think I could get a little help getting out of here? Oh, sure, Mr. C. Thank you. Oh. Here, let me hold the seat. Oh, all right. How's that? Back a little further. Perfect. Look, I'll hold it here and just run along the outside of the car, huh? Here we go. (engine backfires) (engine roars) I think you got a hole in your muffler. What?! I said, I think you got a hole in your muffler!! Yeah! Sounds great, doesn't it?! (engine sputters, stops) Did it have a warranty? Did it leave a will? (Ralph) Wow, look at this car. Super! I'm tellin' you, guys, this car is really smooth. What do you say, Fonz? Yeah! Hey! Hey, uh, girls, want a hamburger? You sure you can afford it after buying this? Oh, well, we did drop a bundle on this baby. Six bills. Really?! Listen, uh, we were thinking about going to the sock hop on Saturday night if you girls would be interested in coming with us. Sure. Great. Yeah. We thought we'd dance a little, grab a bite, then cruise up to the lake to watch the submarine races by the moonlight. Think we can trust them? Hope not. (laughing) Well, how'd you guys like to drive us home? Oh, we'd love to, but we didn't think we'd run into you here so... So we sort of made other arrangements. You understand? Oh. Look, we'll pick you up Saturday night, 7:30, OK? OK. OK. Bye. Let me help. Bye-bye. See ya. So long. Six bills! It's not how you play the game, it's whether you win or lose. (laughing) But what do we do now? We just sit here and play it cool till they close the joint... then we push it back home. (engine turns over) I hope Fonzie can fix it. He didn't exactly say he was. He said he'd look at it. Hey, Rich, I think there's a few things you should know about getting things started when we're at the lake. Oh, come on, Potsie. No, this is important. Pretend you're Betty, and I'm you. Here's what you do. Tell her you think her door should be locked for her own safety. Then you real casually reach over and... lock it. Now see where my arm is now? Then you just put your arm around and... Potsie... Then what happens, happens. Potsie, I got it. Oh, wow! No, Fonzie, no, no. Hi, Fonzie. We were just here... We were looking at the speedometer, checking to make sure all the numbers are there, that's all. What do you think? I-It's probably just... Fuel pump... Hey... We can... Wrench. Wrench. Screwdriver. Screwdriver. Leg. Leg? Leg. OK. Start it up, boys. (engine turns over quietly) Hey, Fonz, you did it! Hands like a surgeon! Fonzie, listen, what do we owe you?! What do you got? Anything we have is yours. Are you sure you want that? He wants that. He took the best part of the car. Boy, this thing's cost us a fortune. Sure hope Betty and Trudy are worth it. Are you kiddin'? Ralph Malph says they're a sure hickey. I hope we don't have any more trouble with the battery. No sweat. The guy who sold it to me said it had 19 good starts in it. (band playing "Hound Dog") Oh, we made it. I'm glad the dance is still on. I told 'em they could start it without me. It's a good thing. Took us three hours to get here. I hope the car will start again. We only used up 17 of the 19 starts. 12 in my driveway. Ah, come on, let's dance. Let's not waste any time. Come on, let's dance. (MC) Cats and kittens, that's all the boppin' for tonight. Now, don't forget your shoes and drive carefully. The life you save may be mine. Ha-ha-ha. This is getting expensive. $2.00 a dance. Heh-heh. Come on. (ballad plays on radio) We didn't get to dance. We hardly got to eat. But we made it just in time for the submarine races. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Uh, what do you like, strawberry or orange? Huh? Lipsticks... I just got two new flavors. Strawberry. Definitely strawberry. Orange makes my lips break out. Me too. (giggles) Hey. Oh, hey, look, your door's unlocked. Look what you did! Look! Try and control yourself, huh, Rich? I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. Gee, I hear the Giants might move to San Francisco. Oh? (Trudy giggling) (Potsie laughing) I want you to know that I respect you as a person. For crying out loud, I feel like I'm in church! Sorry, Trudy. (giggling) Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. (laughs) Mmm. You really like kissing, huh? No, it's the steering wheel... It's killing my hip! Ow! What are you doing?! You're killin' my knees! Sorry! Well, get back in the front seat! My foot's falling asleep! (horn honking) What are you honkin' the horn for?! I'm not! It's stuck! (young man) Is somebody having an air-raid drill? (young man #2) Hey, Cunningham, can't you just say, "Get out of the way"? Pull the wire! I just did! (honking continues) You pulled the wrong one! (young man) Hey, fool, be cool! (young man #2) Hey, turn that horn off! (honking stops) Got it. (rings) Hello? Yes? Who is it, Howard? It's Betty somebody's father. What? Oh. Excuse me. Betty Wilkins' father. Oh? Yes? Oh. Just a minute. Richie's date... He hasn't brought her home yet, and it's after midnight. I hope they're all right. So does he. Uh, look, Mr. Wilkins, I-I wouldn't worry if I were you. Richard's a very dependable young man and he's an excellent driver. I'm sure he'll have your daughter home very soon. Thank you. Goodbye. Well, Howard, how can you sleep after that phone call? It's quite simple, Marion. First I close this eye and then I close... Howard, be serious. Something could have happened. Maybe you should try to find them. Marion, I'm not going out in the middle of the night looking for him. He'll be all right. You're a good father, Howard. Why is it always us good fathers who never get any sleep? Wonderful man. ♪ Bye, love ♪ Bye-bye, happiness ♪ Hello, loneliness ♪ I think I'm gonna cry ♪ Bye-bye, love No, miss, I'm not having any... Miss! ♪ Hello, emptiness ♪ Feel like I could die ♪ Bye-bye, my love, goodbye ♪ There goes my baby ♪ With someone new ♪ She sure looks happy ♪ I sure am blue... ♪ Excuse me! Aren't you Fonzie? Yeah. Aren't you Cunningham's father? Yes. Can we talk? Hey, Ralph. Come here and hold up Cloris for a minute, will ya? Hi, Mr. Cunningham. Hi, Ralph. (Fonzie) Hey! So? I'm looking for Richie and Potsie. Have you seen them? I don't know. You don't know? I mean, I know, but I don't know. You know what I mean? No. Oh. It's like an unwritten law. Whenever a kid's old man comes looking for him, you don't know where he is whether you do or you don't. Can you dig? Look, Fonzie, I'm not looking for Richie in order to punish him. It just so happens to be late, and his mother and I are concerned about his safety. You are? That's nice. Well, thank you. I'd certainly appreciate it if you'd tell me where he is. All right. Pretend you're not talking to me. Turn around. What? Turn around. (sighs) They're up at the lake watching the submarine races. What submarine races?! Hey, hey, hey! Cool it! Will you sit down?! I got my reputation to keep up. What submarine races? Well, uh, I guess you would call it "Pitchin' woo." Gotcha. Thanks, Fonzie. Don't turn around till after I leave. Whoa. Miss, I didn't or... Miss?! Oh. OK, we got the, uh, lights, horn, windshield wiper and ignition wires. That should be it. OK. (ballad plays on radio) (sighs) Well, home, James. And, uh, take your time. You gotta be out of your mind. Well, at least everything works now. (engine sputtering) I think that was number 19. To think I gave up watching Snooky Lanson sing "Shrimp boats are a-comin'" for this. (sighs) One of you girls are gonna have to steer while we push. OK, Potsie, let's back it up. OK. (grunts) Have you got it in neutral? Yeah. I think the tires are stuck. Well, let's try rocking it. OK. Hey, there's your dad! Oh, yeah, what a break! Maybe he can give us a push! Richie! Potsie! Hit the brakes! The car! Richie! The car! Stop the car!! (Betty) Richie! Richie!! (Trudy) Potsie! Well, will you get them out of there?! It's cold! Freezing! It's freezing! Oh, it's so cold! (Potsie) The water's freezing! Do you want to buy a car? Oh! They're all right. You see, Mr. Wilkins, I told you that Howard would find them. Oh, my dear! Girls! Richie, what happened? How do you do, Mr. Wilkins? I'm Howard Cunningham. My husband. Nice meeting you, Mr. Wilkins. My coat! Don't you think you boys should say something? Um... hey, girls, does this mean it's off for tomorrow night? Well, I think I'll go home and dry out my wallet. Bye. See ya. I'll make some hot chocolate. Hmm. Richard... I know, Dad. You're gonna tell me that I just learned an expensive lesson and that buying a junky old car like that was really stupid. Well, now that you got that off my chest, tell me something... How do I get my coat back? Richard, that's too bad about your car. Well, it wasn't a total loss. Fonzie took it off our hands for $25. That was very nice of him. There's a side to that boy Fonzie that nobody knows about. Then he dried it out and sold it back to Otto's Auto Orphanage for 50. Well, I certainly hope you learned your lesson. But you know how it is. Potsie's my best friend... I don't know. Yeah, I understand how it is with friends. Do you have a best friend, Daddy? Sure. Your mother. Who's your best friend, Mom? The milkman. See, I can joke, too. ♪ This day is ours ♪ Won't you be mine? ♪ These happy days ♪ These happy days are yours and mine ♪ Happy days ♪ ♪ Hello, sunshine goodbye, rain ♪ She's wearin' my school ring on her chain ♪ She's my steady, I'm her man ♪ I'm gonna love her all I can ♪ This day is ours ♪ Won't you be mine? ♪ These happy days ♪ This day is ours ♪ Oh, please be mine ♪ Oh, happy days ♪ Happy days ♪
