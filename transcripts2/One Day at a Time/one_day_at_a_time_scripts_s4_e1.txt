  -A Pop original series. [ Knock on door ] -Did you decide what we're  watching for Movie Night? -No. It's like there's nothing good  on Netflix anymore. -Hi.  I'm from the census. -Mom,  why did you do that? -A guy wanting a list of Latinos  in my house? No thanks. -The census is important  for communities of color. We have to participate.

 It determines congressional  seats and federal funding, and Latinos are always -- -Oh, at this point,  I'd rather be murdered. Open the door. -Hi. Sorry about the whole  door-in-your-face thing. -It's okay. Okay.  I've had worse. I've been bit by a toddler,  tased by a grandma. 2010, I was insulted  by a racist parrot. Yeah. Anyway, uh,  my name's Brian, and, uh, this is only gonna  take a few minutes. So, you're --  you're Penelope Alvarez? -Yes, I am. And I am the mother  of Elena and Alex.

 -Oh. Okay.  That's good. And this is your husband? -Oh, God, no.  [ Laughs ] No. -No. So you're single. No husband,  no same-sex partner, no unmarried partner,  no same-sex unmarried partner. -And now we know all  the different ways I'm single. Thank you. Um, I'm very happy --  check that off. -Well,  there's no box for happy. -Okay, I'm 42,  Cuban-American, and I'm  a nurse practitioner. -Alrighty. And you're  the head of the household. -No. I am. -[ Laughs ] No. I am. This is my mother, Lydia.  She lives here, too. -Oh.  -Hello. -Lydia. Yes.  Okay. And, uh,  what is your age? -I am ageless. I was born in Cuba, but now I am  an American citizen. -Okay. I don't need to know  if you're a citizen. That's a common misconception.  I just -- I need to know if you're of Hispanic, Latino,  or Spanish origin. -I'm all three. Do I win something? -No -- No, you don't. Uh... Okay, so then  this must be your husband. -[ Laughing ]  Oh, God, no! Berto is my husband. -Okay.  And where is he? -Uh, he passed away  10 years ago. -And he is here. -Oh. Oh. Well, where do you...  keep him? -Berto is in here  and in here and in -- -Okay, we get it, we get it,  we get it. -Let me just  clear up some things. I am, uh, Dr. Leslie Berkowitz,  Penelope's boss. And, also,  I'm Lydia's exclusive non-sexual  platonic companion. -What does that mean? -I don't know. -Hi. I'm gay. -Oh, well,  that's not a box. -Well, it should be. I'm here, I'm queer,  and I'm proud of my box! No, wait.  That didn't sound right. -That's okay. Look, I just really  need to know the relationships  within the household. -Oh, oh, oh!  Great, great, great! Because this is Syd,  my Syd-nificant other. -Ah.  -And they are non-binary. -My pronounces  are "they" and "them." -Oh. Yes.  They -- They taught us this. It's nice to meet...  you? -Anyway, we're together now,  but next year, I'll be at Yale,  if I get in. [ Whispering ]  I'll get in. -And I'll get in at one of  her safety schools. -[ Normal voice ] But we decided  to break up before we go to college so we're not one of those  couples that thinks their first relationship  is gonna be their last. -We don't want to be  those people. -I get it, I get it. Right now,  I don't want to be me. Okay. Um, so, just who else  lives here? -Sadly, me. -Ah. -I'm Alex.  I'm 15. -And Papito is single. -Right, right.  Because he's...a child. -No.  Because it is impossible to find a woman  who is good enough for him who is not me. -Put down that my grandmother  and I are just friends. -Okay, so,  that's everyone? I hope, please. -Hey, fam. Hey, Dr. B.  Hey, new guy. Wait.  New guy? It's Movie Night.  Am I being replaced? By an older model? -No, I'm --  I'm from the census. -Oh. Great. So important for our Latinx  community to be counted. -Oh, okay.  So you're Latino. -No. Schneider. Cis white male ally. Privileged,  but super-woke. -Ugh! -Does he live here? -All: No! -Pretty much. -I got to go.  I got to go. So, I'll see you all  again in 10 years. Who am I kidding?  In 10 years, President Kardashian is gonna  do away with all of this. -Oh. Been a rough day,  Brian? -Sorry. I just -- I have  a lot of apartments to hit, and, uh, nobody likes  the census guy. -Do not worry. You are doing  a great job. And I promise you  they will all be saying, "Everybody loves Brian." -Yeah, doesn't sound right. -♪ This is it ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, oh, whoa ♪ ♪ One day at a time ♪ -I got to say,  I'm surprised you two are gonna break up  the day you leave for college. -Well, we're mature. -Supe-dy dupe-dy mature. -Actually, can we talk about  how this is going to work? -Same page --  I have no idea. -You didn't  talk about this? [ Chuckles ]  Isn't talking all you do? -That is  a lesbian stereotype... which would have been  really useful in this case. -Why don't you do  a trial run? Like, you go to  the bathroom, and, Syd, you try not to  file a missing-persons report. -Ha ha. We can be apart,  Alex. -And they make you wait  24 hours. But maybe he's right. -Do you think you can even  spend a day apart? -We can spend a day apart. -How about two days? -Make it a week.  -Two days it is! -Ba! -What are you watching? -A Lifetime movie. I just love watching  rich people in trouble. -A-scootch. I came in  to tell you something. -That I need an eyebrow wax?  'Cause I already know. -That is not what  I came in to tell you. But qué barbaridad. I just wanted to tell you  that doing the census made me realize  I was wrong about something. -Really?  That's new. -When Victor left,  I said you needed a man. You don't. You have done so much  without one. -Thank you, Mami.  I really appreciate that. -Ah!  -Thank you. -Honey, I want to  tell you a story. -Oh, there's more.  Okay. -You remind me  of my tía Chuchi. A beautiful woman. She was engaged, but then the man left her,  and she was broken-hearted. And after that,  she found joy in -- in books and -- and in painting and  long walks along the Malecón. By herself, of course,  because she had no one. But she --  she took joy in family. Not her family.  There was no one. But she was  everyone's favorite tía. She didn't give a --  ¿cómo se dice? -- a F. She stopped wearing makeup,  she stopped dyeing her hairs, because what was the point? Oh, she made us laugh  with her stories... and her crazy white hair  blowing in the wind. She used to have a joke. "You want to see  an invisible woman? Watch me  go into this bar." [ Laughs ] And after she drank herself  to death, her funeral  was so beautiful and not at all crowded. That was Tía Chuchi. Sweet dreams. -I'm gonna die alone. -Penelope, you are not  going to die alone. -Tía Chuchi did. -So you're just  making up names now? -Look, the census guy  came to my house, and I realized, in 10 years,  when he comes back, that it will just...  be me. -I see. So this is about  the fact that you're single. -No, Pam! I am very happy without  a man in my life, thank you. -Is that why you texted  all of us "911"? -It's true, though. I don't need a man. The problem is --  I still like men. -We all have flaws. -[ Sighs ] What I want  is to not want a man. Discuss. -Step 1 --  start liking women. Start 2 --  turn to your right. -You should  start dating again, and not just because  when you have a boyfriend, the rest of us  get to talk. -Dating is exactly  what I don't want to do. You know, all that  stupid small talk. "Where'd you go to high school?  How many siblings do you have?" -I went to Roosevelt,  and I have two brothers. -I wish there was an app  called Six Dates In, where you fast-forward to knowing everything  about each other and then just watch "The Great  British Bake Off" together and then -- -Have the great American  pants-off. -Exactly.  [ Laughs ] I can't believe  I'm 42 years old and I'm still worried  about this stuff. In the olden days,  I'd be dead by now. -You could start smoking.  -Or stop using sunscreen. -Or be like  my dumb-ass cousin and try to take a selfie  with a tiger. -Okay, I'm not actually looking  for advice on how to die young. It's been so long  since I dated, and the last great relationship  I had was Max. W-W-What? You all think I should  get back together with Max? -No. We're just all scared to ask you  for his phone number. -You do talk about him a lot,  Pen. -Yeah, Max was great,  but he wants kids, and I don't. -Well, so start dating again.  What else are you gonna do? Shack up with a sex robot who likes English cooking shows? -I hear they're close  on that technology. -[ Robotically ] I like  Yorkshire pudding and your vagina. [ Timer beeps ] -It's been 24 hours  since I talked to Syd. Are you proud of me?  -Actually -- -Okay, you caught me!  I'm a disaster! I miss them so much, and this has been the worst  experience of my life. -This is the most predictable  thing I've ever been a part of. -Mom.  -What? -How do you do it?  -Do what, honey? -Be alone,  go through life without a partner  who cares about you. -Okay, well,  that's one way of putting it. Actually, I've been  talking about this in therapy, and I love being alone.  It's the best. And we're strong women who don't  need a partner to define us. Anyway, I have a date. -What?! You said  you love being alone. -I know. But Ramona set me up with  this guy that she works with, and I don't really want to go, but it's good for me  to get out there. Plus, I am having  the greatest hair day. I can't  keep this to myself. I mean, my babies.  Come on. Look, look.  Look at the bounce. Look, look.  Look at this bounce. Look, look. Look at it! -Your hair's great. -Thank you. -But your brows... Qué barbaridad. -And after Carrie,  it's me, so I'm the youngest. But I had sisters,  so lucky you. -Oh, I just love  hearing about siblings. -Really? -Usually,  I hate this part. I wish we could just  download our histories, and then  the date could begin. -Totally. I agree.  This is the worst. No, that's --  I didn't mean that. -Yes, you did,  and it's okay. -At our age, we just want to  cut through all the B.S. -Oh, my God. Yes, Max.  Thank you. -Max? W-Who's Max? -♪ Max...imum fun ♪ ♪ Is what  we're about to have ♪ ♪ Now that all the family stuff  is out the way ♪ -Cool.  -To the max! Where'd you go  to high school? -Oh, um, I went to -- -You don't care where  I went to high school. -That is true. -Are you okay? -Huh? -Are you okay? -Oh...  yeah, I'm fine. -'Sup, girl? -Do you want me to  dress that? -No. -Syd's gonna dump me,  aren't they? I always assumed I would be  the dumper, not the dumpee. [ Scoffs ] Should I break up with them  before they break up with me? Should I go straight into  a rebound relationship? There is a really hot barista  at the coffee shop downstairs. Do you think Syd is  dating the barista?! If they leave me,  it will just be you and me! -Dear God,  you've got to get them back! [ Knock on door ] -Syd. What are you doing here? -You called me. -No, I didn't. -I did. You were being stupid, so I called them  and pretended to be you. -And that worked? -Of course. [ High-pitched voice ]  "Hello. This is Elena. I'm just sitting here,  not brushing my hair. You want to come over?" -I wanted to be convinced. -Well, this is a disaster. -Nah, it's like four hairs.  I got tweezers. We can take care of it  right now. -What?  What are you talking about? -Your jazz-brows situation. Obviously,  that's why you're so upset. -No! I just went out on a date. -Looking like that?!  -Focus! I went on a date  with a perfectly nice guy, and he kept  turning into Max. -Yeah, happens to me, too.  -What? -Look, Max is awesome, and the fact that  he appears to you as a date or to me as  an imaginary shirtless buddy who gives great advice  is totally normal. -Okay, let me say words,  and you just shh-shh-shh-shh! I have to move on from him,  and, clearly, I can't because I miss him,  and that freakin' sucks. -Pen, you are a strong,  independent woman. -You don't need a man to de--  -I know all that. I do. But Max is still in here. And in here. And in here.  -I get it. -I blame  that stupid census guy, coming in and reminding me  that I'm single? I have to check a box so the government knows that I'm alone? That's aggressive. -Actually, the census kind of  messed with my head a bit, too. -Really? -Yep.  And that's why I got news. I asked Avery to move in  with me, and she said "yes"! -Really?!  -Yeah. -That's huge!  -I know. -Oh, my God!  Seriously! I am so happy for you. -Thank you. Well, you know,  I found the perfect person, and I didn't  want to blow it. -Do you think  I blew it with Max? -Oh, yeah, totally.  -Schneider! -Sorry. I'm sorry. But, hey,  maybe it's not too late. At Victor's wedding, Max wouldn't stop talking about you. Why don't you, you know,  check in with him? -How? I'm not just gonna text him,  "You up?" -Nah,  he doesn't respond to that. -I got to admit, when I drive past  the hospital he works at, I'm always tempted to  pull in and say hi. -So pull in, say hi,  see what happens. -Thank you, Schneider. -Hey, my job,  as your best friend, is to hold up a mirror... and take care  of those eyebrows. -[ Scoffs ] -There's your forehead. -Shut up! Ooh, damn! -I missed you  as soon as you left. -Me too. The moment  I walked out the door, I felt an ache  in the bowels of my bowels. -Okay, let's wrap up  the sexy talk. -What were we thinking? -I don't know. I guess we were trying to  do the mature thing. -Why? You're not mature. You're two teenagers who  spent last week discussing whether some "Star Trek" lady  is gay or not. -Seven of Nine is gay. -No, no, no. All of the Borg  are non-binary. -Except their programming,  which is binary code. -You will be  assimilated. -Can you boldly go  somewhere else? -But no high-school couples  make it through college. Are we just  fooling ourselves? We don't want to  be those people. -You know what? Screw it. Let's be those people. -And I'm gonna be  this person. -Ambulance pulling in! -Ooh, great! [ Quietly ] Oh, my God.  Okay. [ Normal voice ]  Excuse me. Are you expecting any more  horrible medical emergencies? I was hoping to see my ex. -I hear that, sister. -No, I'm sorry.  I'm -- I'm looking for an EMT. -Max? -Yes. -Yeah.  He doesn't work here anymore. -Oh. -He took a job working for some Doctors Without Borders  group in Indonesia. Lucky cholera victims. Anyway, he left  a couple months ago. Sorry. -Thank you. -One of the nurses made  a Max of the Month calendar if you want a copy. It was me. -Listen, Mom, you're a strong, independent  woman who doesn't need a man -- -Yep, got it.  I agree. Yep. But it's okay for me to admit  that I can still be a feminist badass  and want a boyfriend. -Yeah, that is okay. -And I hope  you do find someone, 'cause I'm so happy  and I want that for you. -Aww. -Mom, today made me appreciate  how hard relationships can be. And, more importantly,  how annoying. But don't worry. Nora and I are not  gonna be like that. -Who's Nora? -Oh. I have a girlfriend. -What?
