 Must be at least 110 in here. You mind tellin' me why you're drinkin' tea? Hot tea? Well, it's a thing I heard about, chester. Somethin' in the tea equalizes the temperature of the blood. The hotter you get, the more hot tea you drink. You sweat more, and you feel the heat less. Now, are you gonna have some? Well... No, it's just too hot for hot tea. All right. Go ahead and boil. You're givin' me the horn, ain't ya, mr. Dillon? Huh? Marshal dillon.

 Hello, mrs. Wyatt. It's my boy I've come about. Oh, I know timmy. He's a real nice little fella. Did he rob a bank, Or somethin' like that, mrs. Wyatt? Why, he's a good boy. It's just that since his father died, He's never made many friends. He's always invented his own. Why, it's harmless. Most all children with imagination do it. But this time, he's done it, and... It's not harmless, marshal. Well, sit down, mrs. Wyatt. All around town, they're calling my boy a liar. A liar, at his age? Well, he started by telling his sister. But little girls can't keep a secret. Pretty soon, it was all over the school. Now, he insists it's true. Marshal, you could make him understand How bad lying is, What it will lead to, if he keeps it up. He'll believe you. He thinks you're the greatest man in the world. Well, what is it timmy's lying about? Bad, ugly, Wicked things. A monstrous man and woman Who live in a strange, secret place, Somewhere outside of town. And at night, they go out and rob and murder. Do you see why I've come to you for help? Can you tell me anything more about these...Monsters? This man and woman that tim thinks he's seeing? I think you'd better hear it from timmy. Well, I'll do what I can, mrs. Wyatt, Just so long as your realize it's a little out of my call. Just so long as you make timmy realize What lying can lead to. Marshal dillon. Hello, tim. Hello, maggie. I didn't mean to tell anybody, mr. Marshal. Timmy, I thought it best to bring the marshal. Gee, mr. Marshal, I never been this close to you before. Well, wait till I tell 'em at school. You called me by name. Except they'll think I'm lyin'. Well, tim, I don't understand 'bout all this. I'd like to know more about it. Would you mind if tim and I took a walk alone? You'll tell mr. Dillon the truth, Won't you, timmy? Let's go, if you want to. Down front street, marshal? You and me, walkin'? Sit down, tim. Your mother's worried about you, tim. Now, I don't want to keep at you- You think I'm a liar, mr. Marshal? Well, it depends. I haven't heard your tall tales, yet. They're not tall tales. They're not? White fawn is real. It is? She is. Well, who's "she," tim? An indian. Well? Don't you believe me? Well, what have you told me Outside of the fact that white fawn's an indian? Her folks don't have time for her, either. And you know why? Why? They're too busy goin' outside of dodge, at night. A special place and killin' people dead And takin' money off their bodies. And they don't want white fawn to know what they're doin'. But I've stayed and watched 'em count the money. What are you tryin' to tell me, That white fawn's mother and father Murder and steal? And that you watch 'em count the money they've stolen? More than that, mr. Marshal. White fawn and I followed them all the way Out to this place on the road. We hid in the brush and watched. Watched what? Watched 'em jump out of the sky, Kill the man, take his money, and... And what, tim? I don't know what they did with the body. White fawn and I always got away So they wouldn't know we watched. Now, how is it none of these Robberies and killings have been reported to me, tim? Uh, I don't know, mr. Marshal. Stand up, tim. Come on over here and stand beside me. Tim, I don't believe a word you've said. You- You don't? No, I don't. I think what they say about you is true. I don't blame 'em. I'm no liar, mr. Marshal. I could show you, Except it would hurt white fawn. No, you couldn't, because you're lyin' about the whole thing. I would show ya, If you'd give me your word of honor You wouldn't say or do nothin' about what you saw. Don't tell her mother and father, 'cause that would hurt white fawn. Well, I- I couldn't do that. Then I can't show you, mr. Marshal. I'd better go. Tim. Yes, sir? You got it. My word of honor. Tonight, mr. Marshal. I'll come and get you. He's our friend. He promised. Can we play the game now? You don't look like you've been asleep. Let her alone and come over here. Look. Eight dollars, 33 cents. It's better than last week. I'd say plenty good added to the rest. Nearly $200, all told. That's right. We need another hundred dollars. We'll get it. I'll fix ya somethin' to eat. Just another hundred, And then we'll be all right. You see, mr. Marshal? That's enough. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, tim. No, I mean about white fawn. How much fun she is to be with For a girl. About ya not believin' me, Well, I know all I had to do was show you. Would you let me tell your mother about That I've seen the people you talked about? But you promised. Well, that's right. I did. But it might be kind of a good way To let people know you're not a liar, tim. I'm not a liar, mr. Marshal, And you know that, now. Yeah, I know it. Well, let's be gettin' on. It's past your bedtime. And one of these times, I'm gonna beat white fawn throwin' those arrows. Now, what in the world's the matter with you, today? Nothin', doc. I keep tellin' ya, nothin'. I know better. I've never seen you so preoccupied. Look, doc, when I tell you nothin's wrong, I- What's the matter? I've seen that man before. A year ago, or four years ago... Maybe just walking down this street Or in a saloon somewhere. But he didn't have the beard. I'll see ya later, doc. No, sir. You'll see me some more right now. Well, good day, mr. Ross. Good day. You're probably new around dodge, mister, But I keep thinkin' I've seen you before. Well, maybe you have. I've been here before, off and on. You know me? You're marshal dillon. I just can't seem to remember your name. No reason why you should. I never gave it to you. Could I ask you what you're doin' in dodge? I'm mindin' my own business, marshal. Would, uh... Would you say you've been kinda stepped on, marshal? Do you know his name, mr. Ross? Yeah. Hinton. Edward r. Hinton. Does he have an account with you? That's right. Can I ask you what he was buyin'? You could, marshal, And I wouldn't tell you. Unless you make it official. What do you know about this hinton? Uh, where does he live? What does he do for a living? I'll tell you one thing, marshal. Mr. Hinton's proud as he's honest. He pays regular, And once, he come back in a windstorm To return 85 cents that I'd mischanged him, in his favor. That all you'll tell me about him? He's a customer, That's all. Unless you press it, officially. Besides, it's all I know. Thanks, mr. Ross. Speak nothing of it, marshal. Good day. Matt. Eh? You are just plain determined not to tell me What's bothering you, isn't that it? That's it, doc. Well, I got patients to look after. And you better take it easy, matt. I will, doc. What about it, tim? I can't do it, mr. Marshal. You promised you wouldn't make me. Well, I'm asking you to release me from that promise, tim. If I lead you to where they do their robbin' and killin', They'll do somethin' to white fawn. No, I'll see that they don't. Well, I've been fair with you, tim. Now you be fair with me. I could lie and wait outside that blockhouse every night Till they went out, and then follow 'em. All right, mr. Marshal. I'll take you. But when I do, you won't let nothin' happen to white fawn? I promise. Now, the first time white fawn lets you know That they're goin' out, you come runnin', will you? Yes, mr. Marshal. Thanks, tim. There? That's the tree, mr. Marshal. That's where he drops from. Well, that's what you meant by droppin' from the sky, huh? Yes, sir. It looks like it. Well, he's probably in position by now. I think I'll let you two off and just ride over there. Oh, no. She'll be there in the brush somewhere, watching. She'd see you and warn him if you rode up like that. All right, you two get off and hide behind that rock. And no matter what happens, stay there. What are you gonna do? You said he'd wait until a rider came by Who kind of wobbled in his saddle and sang funny? Yes, sir. Well, that's what I'm gonna be. Please be careful, mr. Marshal. He's awful strong. And wild. All right, you and white fawn just get behind that rock And stay there. If anything happens to me, you get back to dodge And go see doc. You understand? Yes, sir. All right. my daddy came west to kansas to make his home in kansas but all that he made was his own grave I'm gonna move a little. I can't see nothin' from here. What are you doin'? What are you doin'? daddy came west to kansas Don't you move. You stay here, both of you. but all that he made was his own grave when he crossed the path of killer dave Don't go after him, marshal. Mrs. Hinton? He coulda killed ya. Don't go after him. I'm not goin' after him, mrs. Hinton. I'm comin' up to you. She's comin' with me, marshal. You've come back, mr. Hinton. Come back for my wife. Let her go, and I won't shoot ya. I'm not gonna hurt her. And you're not gonna keep her. And you're not gonna shoot me, 'cause you don't even have a gun. Your wife had it. I got one, and I'll use it. Let her go, marshal. First, give me a good reason, hinton. Tell me why I should let her go. Nine years, marshal. They're reason enough. Gotta have more than that. My wife got taken by the cheyennes, Nine years ago, marshal. I looked for her all that time. I come into dodge for supplies, Worked till I got the money, And then start the hunt again. The cheyennes move around. Last month, I found her, And paid off for her. I brought her into dodge, But a man's got his pride. I needed a wagon, and mules, and supplies, To get me and my wife, and her daughter out to oregon. We can start fresh and unknown out there. But I-I couldn't live in town With people askin' where I picked up a daughter. I'll take care o' both of 'em for the rest of my life, But I didn't feel I had to answer How it was I picked up a daughter. That's why we lived alone, and I did what I did, For quick money. And now, marshal, If you don't let my wife go, I'm gonna shoot you and go. You shouldn't have killed anybody, hinton. I never did. I run off after scarin' 'em to death, But that's all. To a couple of scared young pairs of eyes, It must've looked like they'd never get up. Let her go, marshal. I been through too much. I'll shoot ya. No, ya won't. Anybody's had to do all you've had to do Isn't gonna ruin it by shooting now. Besides, like I told ya, You don't have a gun. Stay still, marshal. I'm tellin' ya. White fawn's out there. How will it be with her if you shoot? You're right. I didn't have a gun. Ed- Ed. I tried, liddy. I'll go on tryin', somehow, When and if I can. Yes, you will. And you'll make it. I'll see that you do. Not you. Not anybody. Just me. And I think I can make it, liddy. I think I can. You'll have to spend a while payin' for what you did. Maybe longer than you think is right, but it'll come to an end. During that time, I'll see that white fawn's taken care of. You will? Then, you'll have to work out in the open, for your wagon And your mules, and your supplies. And after that, I'm gonna wave the three of you Off to oregon myself.
