 Persons Unknown (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - The Edge - full transcript 
 After the agony of having the leg implants cut out by nurse Moira Doherty, who later admits really being just a 'recovered' mental patient, the seven find themselves still restrained to a perimeter by a pain weapon. Their lucky chance to break trough once proves futile as the only road leads them straight back. Meanwhile San Francisco newspaper investigative reporter Mark Renbe starts on the case, not supported by his bitching editor and attacked by a mystery man who steals the envelop an informant finally provided.

All I want is to see my daughter Whatever this is, whatever you want... ...There must be something, anything. I need to know that she's all right. Just give me a chance to make sure she's safe, And then I'll do whatever you say. I'm begging you - please. Please. Pretty weird. What? It's like I never even busted it. Yeah, same with the dresser. And, in fact, everything has been cleaned up and put away. The bed's made. Those metal shutters on the window - gone. Yeah, all without a sound. There's more than just the night manager And those guys at the chinese restaurant around here. But where are they? Well, if I think about it too much, I'm just gonna go crazy, so... You don't think that That's what they want, do you? Do you? I don't know. I mean, it doesn't make sense, but... What has so far? You okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I think the others are waiting for us. enjoy, please. All of you, enjoy. Fish is fresh. Delicious. Please, enjoy. Okay, what the hell was that out there? Uh... Most likely an a.D.S. Say what? Active denial system. It transmits high-intensity microwaves. Stimulates the water molecules in your skin. It's the same technology they use to reheat a burrito At 7-eleven, except you're the burrito. Military deployed them in iraq mostly for crowd control. I mean, it won't kill you, but it delivers enough hurt That it'll make you wish it did. Okay, so they've got these pain guns Covering all the exits out of town. Probably all around the perimeter of the town, Most likely positioned somewhere out on the edge of town. Well, that's that, then. There's got to be a way to disarm it. It's definitely beatable. We need to do some recon first, Figure out how many there are and, more importantly, where they're located. I still don't understand the why of it all. Why they're doing this to us? I keep telling you - ransom. It's the only reason to keep us alive. Or we're on some twisted reality show in dubai or something. these cameras around here - Bunch of towel-heads Are probably laughing their asses off right now, Watching the infidels screaming with pain. I know why I'm here. My father. And who the hell is your father? The u.S. Ambassador to Italy. Franklin fairchild? Wait a minute. Why would your father want to kidnap us? I said that's why I'm here. The rest of you have to figure out who put you here for yourselves. What could you have possibly done To make your father want to throw you into a town Surrounded by face-melting pain guns? Things. Well...I'll tell you what I think we should do. I think we should go beat the crap out of the night manager The second he comes on duty. The point of that is what? Because he's obviously one of 'em. I couldn't agree more. He seems to be the only one who knows more than we do. And nothing like a couple of broken knuckles To motivate cooperation. We're not doing that. The hell we're not. There's no reason to do that. He doesn't know any more than we do. He already told us that. Exactly. He told us. The sergeant's right. We need to figure out who we're dealing with first... Figure out this town. I agree. Same here. Sergeant. All right. You take the eastern quadrant. You two, the west. You, the southern end of town, and I'll take the north. Check the buildings. Are there any basements? Are there any maps of the surrounding area? Anything that might give us a clue. Two hours, max. We meet back here, put together what we know. Any questions? Uh, yeah. What rambo movie did you just pop out of? I- I don't get it. How do you guys come up with "child abandonment"? You've got the surveillance tapes. They're showing nothing that could be called Even remotely conclusive. No, no. By all accounts, this woman was a good, dedicated mother. I mean, come on, robert. There's something bigger going on here. What angle are you looking for, exactly? Alien abduction? Funny. You interviewed the grandmother, right? Yes. You didn't pick up anything odd there. Really? Oh, come on. The grandmother is beyond scary. There's no material connection Between the mother's disappearance and the grandmother. Can you at least see if there's something in the deep archives? Pretty busy here, but... I'll see what I can do. Hi. Hi. How's your day going? Can I get you anything? That's okay. Latte, pedicure? No, I-I think I'm good. Let me tell you why you're not good. I have been patiently waiting for an update On the headless homeless story. I'm on it. No, you're not on it. I know what you're doing. You're diddling around with this dead-end, Go-nowhere missing-mom story. There's something kind of weird about it all, kat. I know this routine. This is where you try and convince me What a great story this is. Because it is. And not just a great story, but a story with legs. Multiple front-page spreads - Weeks of 'em. I don't know what's gotten into you, renbe. For five years, you've been the king of sick, And I've loved you for it Because you've made my job so easy. Stick with what you're good at. Leave the legitimate stories to the real journalists, okay? I expect a 10-pound bag of steaming sleaze On my desk by the end of the day - no excuses. Ungh! A man after my own heart. To hell with the grunt and his perimeter search. My name's blackham, by the way. Bill blackham. I don't know if I've properly introduced myself. Charlie morse. So, what's the plan, mr. Morse? Oh, I think you know, mr. Blackham. We wait for the night manager to show up, and then we - Oh. Well, here's a pleasant surprise. Ah! Cognac, mr. Blackham? don't mind if I do. Oh. Well... Here's to success. And, uh... Freedom. Amen to that, brother. Amen to that. Ungh. Come on. Soldier boy back there said we had to explore Every building we could get into. What's the difference if I grab something to wear? So... What, you're a doctor or something? Psychiatrist, actually. But I did an e.R. Rotation in medical school. Huh. What do you think? Me? I don't know. I'm I'm not really qualified in the fashion department. It's a little retro. Oh, what the hey. Hey, they're watching, you know. Yeah. So? I'm just saying. Whoo! Here, you creepy pervs! Get your nads off on these! Whoo! Come on, doc. Let's find you something to wear. Moira. Call me moira. Moira. Cool name. Thanks. That's depressing. But manageable. Meaning it's not miles of ocean or barbed wire. Trees. Trees are... Well, trees. Yeah, only with pain guns and god knows what else. God has nothing to do with this place. So, you believe in god? I take it you don't? You know you have a maddening way Of answering a question with another question? Are you aware of that? I'm sorry. I- I don't mean to. Yes. I believe there's a god. All I know is I'm not waiting around For divine intervention to get out of here. The only thing I know is, every second that I spend here, My daughter's at risk. Megan? Megan? Where are you? In here, nana. You look like you're having fun. Oh, sweetheart, were you playing with nana's puzzle? Yes, nana. Because I'm missing a few pieces. And a jigsaw puzzle - it just isn't very good If it's missing pieces, is it? No. Sweet pea, when you finish playing, come find nana, And we'll grab a little talk About respecting other people's property, all right? Okay. Every way out of town is covered by the pain guns. No surprise there. Yeah, we couldn't see anything from the balcony. Just lots of trees. Trees? Yeah, for miles. The a.D.S.Es are well-camouflaged, But they're definitely out there. Trust me. I felt every one of 'em. Well, I guess we need to find an off switch. Or else come up with a plan "b." I don't understand you people. That man over there - He knows. Totally. Now, we can bang our head against that pain wall all day, But I guarantee you, with the right persuasion, That bastard over there will lead us all the hell out of here. excuse me. I just wanted to mention That dinner will be served in one hour. You might want to freshen up. Where is dinner tonight? At the shanghai palace, right across the street. Not again. Yes, sir. Well, I don't know about you guys, But I am in desperate need of a spa day... Or at least a shower. You going to dinner? You? Yeah. I'll see you there. See you there. So, uh, charlie, you want to go and get... yeah? It's me - moira. I'll be there in a sec. Hi. Well, don't you look amazing? thanks. Aren't you coming to dinner? I am. But look at this. Just showed up in my room. May I? Sure. Wow. A vanessa cardui chrysalis. The painted lady butterfly. Well, cocoon right now. But you see the colors starting on the edges of the pupa? It means she's ready to come out soon. Is it poisonous? No, no, no. It's - it's quite common. It's found all over the world. You seem to know a lot about it. Yeah, I like to read about different things. Did you put it in here? Did you sneak into my room And put this...Bug in here, moira? Why would I? How could I? I suppose you couldn't. It is just like my sick jerk of a father To torture me with a metaphor. Could you be any more obvious?! No, no, no, no. No. Please...Don't. I don't want it in here. It creeps me out. I'll take care of it. Please. Whatever. Hello, gentlemen. How may I be of assistance? This is your answer? This is what you want? Night manager: Help me! Help me, please, somebody! Help me, please! Help me! Please, gentlemen! Hey! We're getting pretty tired of your bull, bud! Now walk. Please. They'll kill me. They don't care about me. I'm just the same as you. Move it! Go! Hey! Stand down! You had your chance. We're handling this now. Help me, please. Blackham, put the gun down. Eat me! He's one of them. I'm not. I swear. They're not gonna fry one of their own. They turn off the pain gun, And we rush out right behind him. It won't work! The hell it won't! They're watching us all the time! You think if he was one of them, They wouldn't have intervened by now? Huh? Janet: Especially since you guys Have been beating the living crap out of him. He's our ticket out of here. There's nothing you can do that's gonna stop us From pushing him over - Ow, ow, ow! Okay. Okay, okay. Ow! I'm sorry about all this. What? Where's he going?! I knew it! Did you see that?! Ah. Sorry. This will take the sting out. Oh, no. Too early. Not for me. Hey, hey! So what's your plan now, mastermind, Now that you've messed up our last best chance At escaping this hellhole? He's right. Damn it. Maybe. Think we should have tortured this guy till he cracked? Even if he was one of them, torture wouldn't have worked. Never does. Yeah, I agree. But if we planned it a little more carefully, We might have had a shot of at least one of us escaping. What do they say - Hindsight has 20/20 vision? Something like that, I guess. The trick is to stay alert, stay frosty. Is that it, sergeant? And pray to the god of your choice for guidance, sir. That's easier said than done. You're not trying hard enough, if you don't mind me saying. Daddy, I know the truth. We'll talk about this later, shall we? I know the truth. You're gonna pay. He's really a very nice man if you don't get to know him. It's open. Hey. Are you okay? I feel like I have a hangover, But I haven't had a drop to drink since we got here. You think maybe that chinese food is loaded with something? I think you might be suffering from depression. It's a pretty stressful situation for all of us. That's an understatement. I want to show you something. I think it might cheer you up. Okay. Look. Isn't she amazing? Yeah. Yeah, it kind of is. I think we should set her free. I think that would be very therapeutic for both of us. Spoken like a true shrink. yeah, well... I'd like to do that, moira. I really would. Me too. I have a nice pension waiting for me in two years. I don't know why I risk it for the likes of you. Because you're my friend? We're anything but friends, renbe. Well, then, it must be because you owe me. God, I hate you. What do you got? Some ugly stuff in there, mark. Real ugly. About janet cooper? Well, not so much about her, but what happened to her. Most of it is juvie, and only a court order from moses himself Will ever get that information unsealed. But there's enough other stuff to get the point across. Like? Read it for yourself. Tell you one thing, though. This lady has been through the wringer. Know about her husband? Husband? No. Ex-husband. Not sure which. True piece of work. Took off and left her while she was pregnant with the kid. Total scumbag if you ask me. I'd love to put a 10-year collar on him. I'll take that, thank you very much. Who the hell are you? No one you really want to know. Now give me the envelope. Please. Go screw yourself. And I asked you so nice, too. There's no respect for civility these days. Now, I've got about enough patience To ask you one more time. Give me the envelope. Attaboy. What's the big deal? Let's just say I have a client who'd stop at nothing To make sure that none of this information Gets into that filthy rag of yours. Like janet cooper's mother. Now, you see, mr. Renbe, It's questions like that That are gonna be the death of you. You know, tori found a chrysalis in her room. In a jar. A what? A chrysalis. I don't know. Pupa. I don't know. Cocoon. It just showed up, like magic. Really? Just showed up? Was next to that damn fortune I got the other night. "you will soon win a high prize or award." Anyone else just have something show up in their room? No, nothing. No. Of course not. It's just my father messing with me. So, you think this is all about you, don't you? Pretty much, yeah. Whoa, whoa! What was that?! What the hell was that?! I think it's the pain gun! At least, the explosion came From where the pain gun should be. What are you saying - the lightning took it out? Looks that way. What are we waiting for, then? Hey, where are you going?! Let me go! Where are you going?! The van. We should take the van. How do we get the keys? I can hot-wire it. Hello? Used-car salesman. We don't have much time. They'll figure out the a. D.S. Is down. We don't know how many more are out there. All right, we need to create a distraction. I can do that. Okay, let's go! Go! Go, go, go! Come on, hurry up! Ah... You want something? I will help you! We can help you! Please! I want to help you. Okay, please stop. We can do something to help you. okay, got it! Wait, stop! No damn way, sister. Moira's in the restaurant! You have to! Hey, just do it. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! Hurry up! Come on!

We made it through. Do you have any idea what time it is? Sorry, boss. Where have you been? I was worried about you. I just wanted to let you know I'm bailing out of the missing-mom story. What changed your mind? It was a dead end, just like you said it would be. What's this? I, uh, clunked my head on the refrigerator door. I know what to do to make it better. That's what I was counting on. Tell you what I'm gonna do when I get home. I'm gonna eat the biggest damn t- bone I can get my hands on. Ha! We need to get as far away from here As this tank of gas will take us first, right, sergeant? And then some, sir. On foot, if we have to. Hey, call me joe, okay? Sorry. Habit. Name's graham. Graham mcnair. Good to know you, graham. Likewise, sir. Uh, joe. Somebody's gonna pay for this. Yeah? Yeah. If it takes me the rest of my life. Whoever did this to us... Is gonna pay. You've got that right. That was pretty smart, what you did back there. What? You scared the living crap out of those guys. I guess I did. And managed to save our collective asses. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What? What's that? What is that? Don't stop. Don't stop! What are you doing? What are you doing?! There's something not right about this. It could be help. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. No, we're gonna crash into it! She's right. She's right. You're gonna kill us all! Come on, come on! Night manager: Good evening. Looks as if the rain is letting up. Should be a beautiful day tomorrow. Would you look at that? It figures. No, tori. Tori, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I thought that that would - You thought wrong, didn't you? Don't sweat it - you're just one more shrink in a long line of 'em That's tried their voodoo on me, with dismal results. No, I'm not a psychiatrist. Say what? I'm a patient - A psychiatric patient. Or at least I was until I came here, At st. Mary's hospital in sandusky, ohio. this gets better and better. I'm sorry. I have truth issues, but I- I will be better, I promise. Please. I'm sorry.
