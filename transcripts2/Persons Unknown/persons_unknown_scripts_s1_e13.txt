 You're just in my head, joe. You don't know where I'm going any better than I do. guess that's true. But we both know where you've been. that's for damn sure. Unh! Hey. So, I just finished doing all the bedroom stuff. You know, you have a lot of socks. Yeah. What's wrong, mark? Oh, more rejection notices. 64 in 6 months. Must be some kind of record. Well, you just got to keep trying. So you keep saying. God. I think I need a change of venue. Two years writing a novel that no one's gonna read. It's... It's not good for anyone's health. Well, so take a break. You should. Think so? Yeah, absolutely. I've, uh... I got an idea. Yeah? It's a pretty crazy idea. So, typical mark cooper. I went down to the marina this morning. I spoke to a guy who's desperate to sell his sailboat. 36-footer. What? No, I-I'm thinking that if I - you know, I sell my car And pretty much everything else I own, We can afford it. Well, I didn't know you knew how to sail. I don't. He's gonna throw in some free sailing lessons. Well... That sounds adventurous. So, what do you say? I think there might just be one small problem. Okay. I'm pregnant, mark. Pregnant. Yeah, I was gonna tell you - no, just - When? How? How? We never talked about this, janet. I know that. No, we never talked about this! I know that, but I thought that you'd be happy about it. Well, you thought wrong. Dead wrong! Woman on p.A.: Orderly to surgery room 5. Orderly to surgery room 5. Miss cooper, you're up early. Where am I? You're safe. Let's go back to your room. No, no. I-I need to - I need to see my daughter. Yes, you'll see your daughter. We'll see about your daughter when you get back to your room. No, no. Let me - I - don't - Nurse! We need to get back to your room, miss cooper, really. You're hurting me. Miss cooper, it's all right. You're safe now. Where am I? Siker memorial, san francisco. I'm dr. Lemchen. We found you wandering highway 101 Near half moon bay four days ago. There you go. No, no! I want to go home! I want to see my daughter! Dr. Lemchen: You will see her. I promise you. We have to make sure that you are all right. You're one of them, aren't you? You're part of the program. Nurse: Right down here. No, no! Get the restraints, please. Help me! Megan! Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com Miss cooper, I'm detective gomez, San francisco p.D. You have no idea how glad I am to see you. Really? Really. I've been looking for you for quite a while. Well, that's good to hear. I know you've been through a lot, But I was hoping you'd feel up to answering a few questions. Not until I have a few of my own answered. Where is my daughter, and when can I see her? As soon as you're up to it, I promise you'll see megan. Believe me, I want that to be sooner than later. Dr. Lemchen here tells me you claim You've been held all this time in a town of some kind? Yes. But you don't know where. No. Did you ever see any of your captors? No. Not specifically. But you couldn't escape. Well, the town was, uh - Was surrounded by some kind of a device. We called it the pain wall. "we"? There were others? Yeah. We managed to escape, And then there was some kind of accident, And, uh, the next thing I know, I- I woke up here. Has mark cooper had any contact with you? My ex-husband? No. So you don't believe he was responsible for your disappearance? I haven't seen mark cooper Since he took off in the middle of the night, Abandoning me and my daughter. We're trying to track him down now. But y- no. You're not listening to me. You are wasting your time looking for mark cooper. You need to figure out who kidnapped me. There were other people - joe tucker, bill blackham, Charlie morse, moira dougherty, Graham mcnair, teresa randolph... Tori fairchild. You need to find them. No. What's she doing? What's she doing?! Detective, I think miss cooper's had enough for today. You need to find them. You need to find out what happened to them. Well, we'll talk more when you're feeling better. Find the town, you find the program. Find the town... I can't do this. I can't. You don't have a choice, moira. Yeah, but to what end? What's the point? Freedom. Freedom? I'm not letting anyone lock me up again, all right? I'd rather die first. So we do whatever we can to stay free. Agreed? Yeah. All right. Let's find someplace to sleep. And keep up. Stop, stop, stop! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Come on! Hey, maybe we should've stopped. We can't take any chances, bill. There's no one we can trust. I suppose. Besides, it's just a matter of time Before the owners of this vehicle Realize it's been stolen. How long did the tow-truck guy say that he'd be? About an hour. Renbe. Seriously? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I- I'll get there as soon as I can. That was detective gomez. They found janet. They did? Yeah. Wandering on highway 1. She's at siker memorial in san francisco. Alive? Yeah, yeah. Oh. Oh, that's great. Yeah. Dr. Lemchen: Hello, janet. There's someone here I want you to meet. Dr. Andrea adams. Hello, miss cooper. I was hoping to ask you some questions About that town you were in. Janet's been through a severe trauma, Resulting in some serious delusions. Well, she's not the only person Who told me about this town and people kidnapped. Her own ex-husband told me the exact same story Before we found her. Well, if the ex-husband had a hand in her kidnapping, It would not be unusual For her to accept the kidnapper's scenario. Once accepted, She would go to any lengths to maintain the delusion. Hopefully, eventually, she will see That this town delusion is simply that - a delusion. In the meantime, she needs to be in a facility Where she's not a danger to herself or others. I would not reunite her with her daughter Until we can confirm her mental status. I agree. It's not a prudent course of action. I can get the paperwork started. Oh, man. We should've never left. What do you mean, the town? Yeah. I mean, at least we had something to eat, a place to sleep. But you've conveniently forgotten the part Where they were going to kill us. you know what? I'm not completely sure that that's true. You remember ulrich's head exploding like a pumpkin? Yeah. I guess. Trust me, bill - If this experience has taught me anything, It's that I am willing to do whatever it takes to survive. What, like anything? Yeah. Anything. Nurse: Here we go, miss cooper. What are these for? They'll help you sleep. And if I refuse to take them? I'll have to ask one of the orderlies To help me help you take them. Come on, now, miss cooper. It's for your own good. Thatagirl. I'll come and check on you in a little while. Kat: What's going on with you? I, um... I just can't believe it's all over. Is it? Oh, yeah. Then why are we going to the hospital to visit janet? 'cause I have to know she's okay. I need to know. That's it. And, uh, to tell her - Tell her that I'm sorry... For everything... And hope for some kind of forgiveness. You do realize that there's an excellent chance that she won't. You know, forgive you. I mean, I wouldn't. I know. I mean, we're basically at rock bottom, mark. We don't have jobs or money or a place to live, and... It's kind of like starting at square one. I am... I am really sorry for all this, kat. I really am. I'm not. Unh! Ugh! Ugh! Woman on p.A.: Nurses' supervisor, call the operator. Woman: I'm sorry, but there's no one by that name Registered at this hospital. No, no, no. That's impossible. Robert gomez told me specifically That janet cooper was here. And you are...? Mark cooper. I'll try again. Thank you. Something about this isn't right. You think? Mark. Run. Go. Go! Renbe! Renbe! Elevator. Dr. Lewis, e.R., stat. Admissions, please call nurse's station. Up there! Out of the way! Move! Whoa. I see him! Man: Right there! Gomez: Move, move! Janet?! Mark? Aah! Janet! Mark! Tell me more about the people in this town, janet. There's not much more to tell. So, you were the only person Who survived the van crash after you all escaped? I'm - I'm not sure. Because you don't remember how you got here. No. But you all escaped from this town. No, not all of us. Oh, that's right. There was one. Joe. Yeah. He sacrificed himself to save the rest of us. How did you feel about leaving him behind? Sick to my stomach. That must have been very difficult for you. You had some feelings for joe. Yeah. I guess I did. And you know what? I think I'll always love him for what he did for us... What he did for me. So, as you can see, Janet is alive and unharmed... Just as I promised. But not free. I suppose not, no. What will happen to her? Well, that's up to you, dear, isn't it? Threatening me or her Won't get you the information you need. Well, of course, we have other methods. Well, go ahead. Try to extract it out of me. But no amount of time in that white room of yours... Will get you anywhere. They didn't tell me anything. And I wanted it that way. You'll never get to her, you know. You'll never be able to control her, ever. This one you won't win, madam director. Trust me on that. Not now, neil. We have a problem, madam director. Three people don't just disappear In the middle of the night! I want an a.P.B. Put out, pronto, wide net. I'm not interested in excuses! Damn! Get in here. Your mother's worried sick about you. It's okay. My baby. Mommy? Is this a dream? No. I'm right here. I'm right here, baby. Go back to sleep. It's okay. Please forgive me For convening this emergency meeting at this late hour, But we have a situation. Yes, we most certainly do. I wasn't aware that you were attending. The events of the past few weeks Have been of grave concern to me. And to me, as well. But I believe we have an extraordinary scenario unfolding That demands extraordinary measures. This scenario of yours Has exposed this institute to unnecessary risk. I am aware that there have been Certain unexpected and unplanned-for events. With all due respect, madam director, That may be the understatement of the century. Can we call a spade a spade here? You've messed up, madam director - Gone beyond the purview of your directive. And I think I speak for all of us here When I say that we're not 100% certain That we are prepared to continue supporting This three-ring circus. Fine. I will take full responsibility. You are welcome to relieve me of my duties If you feel so compelled, But right now, right this minute, We may be letting the most important participant Slip through our fingers If we do not take immediate action. So you say. So I say, yes. For 25 years, I have successfully guided this institute, Which has reached a level My predecessors could only have imagined. I will not have my judgment questioned. Well, then... Proceed. Eleanor: The most important thing... Is that you're all right. I know you think that I'm crazy, but I'm not. Sweetheart, I think you've been through a lot, More than any one person Should ever have to go through in their life. Oh. Poor baby. I'm so very sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm just - I'm just so tired. And I don't want to lose her again. Shh. And I don't know what to do anymore. It's okay. We will figure all this out. We will. We'll figure it out together. Yes? Director: Hello, elly. Do you know who this is? You can't have her, helen. Now, now, is that any way to talk to an old friend? I won't let you take her. I've just gotten her back, and I won't give her up. Elly. Elly, come on, now. You must know in your heart This isn't about me or you or even janet. We made a commitment long ago. You must remember. Samuel will drive you to the border. Trust him. He knows what to do. Everything that you've said, Everything that you know is true. How do you know this? There's no time to explain. I had hoped and prayed that this day would never come, But it has. You must leave...Now. All right? Okay. Okay. no! Hey! Hey! You bastards! You can't just leave me here! Man: They can. And they will. I'm - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that - that you're here. Ambassador fairchild? Miss damatto. Director: Sergeant, you must believe me when I say That this is not my favorite method of persuasion. Aaaah! We have a serious situation here, graham. Several of our guests have disappeared from sight - Your friends. I feel responsible for their safety and well-being. I don't know anything. You suppose you believe that you are helping your friends When, in fact, you are doing the exact opposite. I appreciate your compassion, sergeant. I even admire it. Unfortunately, it has no place in this endeavor, Which is why I am afraid this procedure is necessary. Charlie: You know what I know? Bill: What's that? I'm not the same man I was when I woke up in that town. I've changed in ways... I never thought possible. You've changed, too. Um... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I guess I have. We're lucky, you and I. We get a second chance. Now we're free. We probably can't ever go back to the lives we had, But, personally, I don't want to. I'm ready for a change. Well, yeah, yeah. I guess I am, too. Oh, yeah, I guess we should probably get some sleep. You miss charlotte? Yeah. I sure do. How did you know my wife's name was charlotte? Uh, you told me. No, I didn't. So you've been working for my mother this whole time? Something like that. Not for them. No. She tried to protect you from them. I did, too. I never thought that they'd get you. I'm sorry that happened. I let her down, Then I - I let you down. You know, I know this is hard for you to believe, janet, But she loves you. She always has, and she always will. You should try to get some sleep. We have to leave before daybreak. I don't think I can. You try. Okay? I'm gonna be right outside the door. No worries. Okay. I love you, mommy. I love you, too, baby. Well, I'd like you to come up to san francisco. Meet my daughter, megan. Would you want to do that? Yeah. What's she like? Megan's 5 going on 40. On the outside, she's a pretty little girl And secretly a little demon Who gets older kids to do her dirty work for her. A girl after my own heart. Bet that's what you were like as a boy. The boy scout from hell. mommy? Unh! Megan! What happened, mommy? Why are you crying? Mommy? How could you? You're running out of ideas. Where am I? I don't know. I just woke up five minutes ago. My name's joe. I know who you are... Father. I'm sorry? I know who you are. And I want to know what you've done with my wife. Janet cooper. Listen to me! In your bible, there's a key. It's next to your bed. Look in the bible! There's a key! There's a key in the bible In the dresser next to the bed! Do you hear me? There's a key in the bible next to the bed in the dresser! Good morning, everyone. I hope you all slept well. I'm victoria, the hotel manager, And if there's anything I can do To make your stay more comfortable, I hope you'll let me know.
