 One of you will be checking out. The taxi - I saw one from my window! Y- you're taking me? Why me? So, where are you taking us? Janet cooper is my wife. You're a monster. No, I'm just a businessman.

 Thank you, daddy. Are you threatening withdrawal? Yes or no, joe. "there's a wolf in me... "fangs pointed for tearing gashes. "a red tongue for raw meat and the hot lapping of blood. I keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me." "and the wilderness will not let it go." "there is a baboon in me. Clamoring claw, dog-faced, yawping a galoot's hunger." "o, I got a zoo. I got a menagerie inside my -" What the... Joe, where are you? "for I am the keeper of the zoo. "I say 'yes' and 'no.'

 I sing and kill and love and work." You shouldn't be down here. Is this how you get off, tom? Watching us sleep While you recite carl sandburg poetry? Hey, I'm just doing my job, Just like you should be doing your job. Do you like your job - watching? Monitoring. Just like someone else is monitoring us right now. What has got your knickers in such a twist That you would go and break protocol For the second time in less than two days And bust my hump about following orders? You know what's bothering me. The woman? There's no place for that here, my friend. There just isn't. I thought you understood that. Yeah, so did I. There's something about her. I don't know. I mean, haven't you ever had feelings for another - don't - Don't complete that sentence. I don't want to have to red card you. You'd do that? I would. Go. You'd better get back up there. Go. I like you, joe. Try not to do anything stupid. I'll try. Morning. Hey. You're up early. Yeah. I, uh... I just went for a walk. Couldn't sleep. I know. I haven't slept since we got here, Except that one night in the...Cabin. Are you coming to breakfast? Just need to clean up, then, yeah. Meet you there? Okay. Okay, see you. Hey, have you guys seen tori? She's probably at breakfast. No, we were supposed to go down together, And I just went to her room to wake her up, And nothing is there. What do you mean, "nothing"? It means it's been swept clean, sanitized - No sign anyone was ever in that room. We should do a sweep of the town. Yeah, agreed. Aren't we overreacting a little? I mean, she might've just gotten up early, and... Okay, maybe not tori, But I think that it's a reach to think That she just disappeared from the town. Maybe it's not such a reach. Maybe tori was right. Maybe her father was keeping her here To teach her some kind of lesson. Well, if that's true, then there's hope for all of us. Oh, my god, tori. Who is this? What the hell? Oh, my god. She's got a pulse. She's alive. Where's tori? Transcript by Addic7ed.com Yes, ma'am. Hurry up. Here, here. Come on. She's barely breathing. Really? Ooh, somebody partied a little too hardy last night. Who the hell is that? Her name, you think? Could be. Yeah. Has the look of a prison tat. Hey, guys, hold on. I asked you a question. Who is this woman? Well, it's not tori. Well, duh. Of course it's not tori. Look at her. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What happened to tori? We don't know. Her room was empty no sign of her. She got out? We hope so. What do you think that means? Webs signify a lot of things - That you're trapped somewhere like prison or you - Killed somebody. Oh, well, that's great. We've traded a crazy party girl For a tatted junkie jailbird. Nope, she was in a hospital. Look. These needle marks are all from the same day, Brand-new, and medically administered. Yeah, so says you. Well, I need a cup of coffee. Why don't you go get one? I think I will. Yeah. You know, and, fortunately, Hop sing and his merry band of chinamen make a decent cup. So, good luck with the tattie-tat girl. Good morning, mr. Blackham. How did we sleep last night? Let's take her upstairs. Ready? My room. Watch her head. What the hell happened now? Why is that woman wearing tori's clothes? Where's tori? Whew! You've really added to that. Yeah, I got a lot more to go. My head's working faster than my hand. "tori gone. Good thing or bad thing?" Good question. I want to think that she's back in rome With a glass of barolo. I hope so, too. But you don't think so. We can't be certain of anything. It's been more than two weeks, And we're no closer to knowing why we're here Than the day we arrived. You know that agatha christie mystery "and then there were none"? Mnh-mnh. Anyway... All these people get invited to this island, And then - they don't know why - But then one by one, they're murdered. By who? By someone pretending to be a guest. By the person you'd least expect. Are you saying... One of us could be doing all this? Yeah. That doesn't make any sense. Does anything make any sense here? I'm scared. I swear, nothing's gonna happen to you. All right? You're fired. You can't just fire me! And yet I have. I mean, I would like to take full credit for your axing, But I think most of the thanks Goes to your police-detective friend, gomez. He called the publishers. Funny how they don't like having suspected felons on the payroll. Kat, come on. You said you were gonna help me. Unh-unh. I never said that. I distinctly remember hearing you say that you were gonna help me. What you said is, "will you please help me find my ex-wife, "who I knocked up then abandoned right before -" Let's see - "right before I started sleeping with you?" I don't remember saying it quite that way. But that's what I heard. So, vaya con dios. You know the all-too-sad irony? I could've cared less that you were married, But I don't like being lied to. I don't like it one little bit. I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I was such an idiot To think that maybe you weren't just sleeping with me To keep your job. That was never it. Look... I won't argue with you about my honesty issues. I- I obviously need to work at that. But the way I felt about you... Feel about you... Is real. It's very real. You're amazing, you know that? You are so full of it. Goodbye, mark. And don't let that proverbial door Hit you on that bony ass of yours. No change? No. Do you think she could be in a coma? It's possible. I guess that's lucky for her. She doesn't know what she's missing. Wait a minute! hey, hey, hey. Erika? Is that your name? I'm joe. This is janet. It's okay. You're safe. Y- you're okay. We're gonna help you. Everything's o- aah! Aah! Stop! It's not gonna work! Aah! Unh! We tried, okay? We even broke through temporarily, But we ran into something worse. You cannot get out of this place. Erika, the only hope we have is sticking together! Hey. Turn up the tv. Turn up the tv. After this song. Turn up the tv! Fine. Whatever. The u.S. Ambassador has been notified. Victoria fairchild, Well-known party girl in diplomatic circles, Disappeared more than two weeks ago. Her body was found this morning In the famous caligari fountain. And there is ambassador franklin fairchild Entering the police station in rome. At this time, authorities have no suspects In the murder of the ambassador's daughter. Tori. If you've done anything to her, you bastards... thank you, linda, for that report. Recapping our top story, victoria fairchild, The 25-year-old daughter of franklin fairchild, The ambassador to Italy, Was found unharmed by police today in the prizi district. I am very grateful To have my daughter back safe and sound. I am also grateful to the italian authorities, Who pursued this matter so tirelessly To such a happy result. Thank you. Unh! Oh, god! Ohh! Ohh! Okay, okay, I get it. You like it rough. Ohh! Ohh! Oh, god. What are you doing? Ohh! Ooh! Oh! So, you feel like telling me what happened with tori? Is this becoming a habit with you? Where is she? Ms. Fairchild? No longer with us. Meaning? Joe, you know what that means. Who's next? No idea. All right, but someone. Yes, joe, there will be other eliminations. There always are. Janet? Don't know, don't want to know. What's with this new woman? She's a trip and a half, isn't she? She's wild. Who is she? Okay, joe, enough with the questions. I got work to do. So do you. Oh, hey, uh, try the pressed duck tonight. You won't be disappointed. Somebody! Somebody, help me! Oh, no. It looks like we've had ourselves a busy afternoon, Haven't we, mr. She tried to kill me. Who? That crazy bitch. Which one? Look, you got to stop joking around, man! We're all in danger, okay? You got to help me. We got - we got to stick together! Okay. Okay. But it's time you realized, mr. Blackham, That it's survival of the fittest around here. Does this hurt? Aah! Oh, I'm sorry. Oh. I'm sorry. Okay, best of luck. Aah! I'll get you some ice, sir. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop her! Hey! Hey, stop her! Stop! Stop! Hey! Erika! I told you, okay? You don't have to be afraid of us. It's okay. It's okay. You can trust us. Hey! Hey, grab her, grab her! Oh, no. Erika. Erika, it's okay. Okay, erika, we're not gonna hurt you. Erika, come on. You're safe here. Erika, you have got to calm down. No! No, no, no, no! No! Joe! Joe, the door! I can't get it! I can't open it, janet! Joe! Janet! Open the door! Just talk to me. Okay. I'll do the talking, then. My name's janet - janet cooper. I live in presidio park in san francisco. One night, I'm kissing my daughter good night. And the next day, I'm grabbed in a park... And I end up here. I'm just saying - I'm scared as hell, too... ...Of this place and... What they might do to us... ...And what they might do to my daughter. Okay? Well, the only thing you got to be afraid of now... ...Is me. What's going on, tom? Business as usual. Really? This is not part of the protocol! Slight modification. No, you need to stop it. Now! Sorry, pal. No can do. No, no, no. How long are they supposed to be in there? Until we have a result, joe, or until their oxygen runs out. The vault is a vacuum chamber, slowly sucking the air out. Meaning they'll die in there? Yes, joe, that is a possible outcome. Back off. You can't help her, joe! You got to let it play out. No, the hell I do. They're watching, you know. And listening. Good. I'm gonna cut this bitch's throat If you don't open that door! It's not gonna work. Shut up! They won't respond. I'll do it. I swear! Ohh! D- don't move. Honestly, I- I don't want to hurt you. I've already died once. I don't know that a second time would be any worse. Joe! What happened? They got locked in the vault. What? How? It just closed, and I couldn't stop it. Try the wall. Try the wall. Joe. Good. It should take him about, oh... 50 years to break through. That's steel-reinforced concrete - Just like in prison. You are friggin' unbelievable. I know. I don't know what to say. In case it slipped your mind, Breaking and entering is a crime in this state. I still have a key. You didn't ask for it back, so I - So, naturally, you assumed That you could just break into my apartment whenever you like. I tried to access my nexus account, but it was canceled. That's because I fired you! I think I'm onto something, kat. I don't give a flying rat's ass what you think! Listen to me. This is bigger than anything to do with janet. I know it sounds crazy, but I think somehow, Her disappearance is linked to that ambassador's daughter. You have really gone off the deep end. There's something else going on here. If janet was abducted - Just shut up about her! Would you just shut up?! There's something about this that I just can't let go of. That's because you still care for janet. No, no. It's... I don't think it's that. Not in the way you mean. But I have to keep searching Until I know what happened to janet. I have to find her for megan. For your daughter - The one you abandoned. You know what, mark? You do whatever it is that you need to do. You just do it without my help. Kat... Get out now! Get out! Next time, I call the police. Got to give that joe guy points for trying. He's been at it, what... 10 minutes straight? yeah. You've known him a long time? Just since we got here. But he means a lot to you. He's just someone I trust. There's your first mistake. Trusting anyone... Especially a man. He wants to get out of here as much as I do. Maybe. Why do you want to get out of here so bad? Get back to my daughter. What's her name? Megan. She'll be 6. She with her father? He, uh, left before she was born. I haven't seen him since. You ever think maybe that's a good thing? Almost every day. You got kids? Son. Anton. He'd be about 11 now - 11 years, 3 months, 2 days. He don't live with me, though. Where is he now? Foster care. Where's your daughter? I don't know. With my mother, I guess, but that terrifies me. When's the last time you saw anton? A long time ago. I haven't been a very good mother to him. I wanted to be. Just didn't turn out that way. Well, hopefully, you'll get to see him again, too. Probably not. No, really. We're gonna get out of this place, erika. Well, I don't know if you've noticed... But we're running out of air. Come on! Where are you going? To get help. Blackham and morse are useless. I know. Sir, will you be wanting turn-down service tonight? And what about you, ma'am? When you said you'd already died once... What did you mean? You see these? Lethal injection. You were gonna be executed? I was executed. Courtesy of the state of texas. Last thing I remember, I'm laying on a gurney. As everything started to fade... All I can remember thinking was... "dying ain't so bad after all." Next thing I know... I'm looking up at your pretty face, Guessing I must be in heaven. Why'd you run, then? 'cause hell is where I ought to be... Where I deserve to be. I figured it must be a trick of the devil or something. Is this heaven... ...Or hell? Neither. This place is very real. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. Janet? Janet? Janet, are you still with me? You're still with me, right? Yeah. What am I gonna do with you, joe? You need to open that vault. Come on, you can't let them die in there. Everything you've gone through, Everything you've worked for - You'd really throw it away for her? Yes. Sorry, my friend. I've got my orders. Stop it. Stop the countdown. This is your last chance... To change your mind and get back on point. Open the door! Come on. Come on. Thank you. Where's joe? Right here. Okay? Huh? You're okay. You're all right. You're the last person I expected to see again. No kidding. It's a mystery even to me why I'm here. You want to come in? No. This is as far as I go. I understand. Thanks. For this. None of that means dick If you don't face up to the real issue, mark. Go see your daughter. You owe it to megan, and you owe it to yourself, too. Janet! Oh, my god, you're okay! Oh, thank god. I've got you, you bitch! You took my clothes! Get off me! Ow! What are you guys doing? ! She's the enemy! No, she's not. Stay away from me. Hey...I'm sorry. I didn't know what I was doing here. It's okay. I understand. Hey! Don't you think you owe me an apology, too?! Dream on, loser. Yes? thank you for your cooperation, mr. Ambassador. I know how difficult it must have been for you. Go to hell. If there had been any other way... I won't participate in any more of your charades. You will. You must. You've already taken my little girl from me. What more could you do? I'm afraid quite a bit more, mr. Ambassador. Quite a bit more. As-salamu alaykum! As-salamu alaykum. You thinking about megan? Always. Good. I want you to know something. No matter what... I got your back. Hey, that's - that's a great bike. Bet you can't wait to get rid of those training wheels. You're not supposed to talk to me. Mommy says I can't talk to strangers. Mommy's right. That's rule number one. I'm not a stranger. I'm... You're that reporter from the register. Megan, sweetheart, go show me how well You can ride your new bike nana got you. I believe that parental consent is required Before one can interview a child, mr... Cooper. What? Mark cooper. No. You're... Who you think I am. Yes. I know what you must think about me, but right now... I'm just somebody who knows megan's mother. Is that true? What do you want? I just want what's best for your granddaughter. I, uh... I want to tell megan something. You be very careful what you say. It's okay. Megan... Your mommy misses you very much. You talked to mommy? No. But I will. I'll find your mommy. I, uh... I promise. Hi. How are you feeling? I feel better. Thanks. I wanted to apologize. What for? You getting hurt. It was my responsibility to keep you all safe. I let you down. All of you. That's not true. Look, we're in this together. And we're gonna get out of it, somehow, together. I know it. Just like tori. Tori's dead, moira. Well, that's just it - she isn't. I know this sounds crazy, but I was in the dress shop, And a tv was there with a news report Showing tori alive, back in rome. It had to have been some kind of trick. No, it wasn't. She's still alive. I know it. I always knew this place Was some kind of military training camp. They test you to see if you'll crack under pressure. Graham... I failed, moira. Let's just leave it at that. Wait. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. I... I got to tell you something. It's about joe. You've done it now, joe. Couldn't let janet die, tom. This wasn't about her, okay?! This was about you, pal - you and me. This was our test. Ours? Yes, ours. You put us both in danger. Understand that. I do. Can't help the way I feel, tom. I was hoping you could. Yeah. So, now what? I don't know. Guess we'll just have to... Wait and see. But I'm guessing it won't be good. www.addic7ed.com
