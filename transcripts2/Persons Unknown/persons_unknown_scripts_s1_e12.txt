 Persons Unknown (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 12 - And Then There Was One - full transcript 
 After forensic analysis of a thumb traces it to the surviving owner, a naive aid doctor, Renbe finally pieces together which 'foundation' is the manipulative organization and intrudes its HQ, only to be thrown out instantly. In town 28, the director toys with night manager Ulrich's request to return to office duty while body bags are delivered and he must tells the others they'll kill each-other. He's seen on cameras starting a frenzy of suicide and killings which leaves only Joe alive, but dead angles allow preventing actual deaths.

 I don't think pi can do this anymore. You're under arrest for the abduction of janet cooper. I didn't kill those people. They were already dead. So you just cut off their thumbs? He's after her, you know. I mean, at least ulrich is out there With who he is and what he is. Do you trust me? In the long run, we believe that you are someone Who will come to understand Not only what we're trying to do, but will embrace it.

 The paper got bought last week. This is a manipulation. Liam: What you and I imagine to be free will Is just an illusion. Joe: Unbelievable. Aah! I just know that ulrich isn't the way. You don't know that for sure. Guys in charge act like your friends, But they only want what they want. I don't know what's going on with janet, But it seems like she's got a thing for ulrich. I'm no longer sure of anything. Charlie: Or maybe he just needs someone to remind him That he doesn't have to sell his soul to the devil.

 Ohh! Aah! I know you think you got ulrich in the palm of your hand, but you don't. Janet: He lost his family. Joe: Ask him for the truth. But you of all people should understand why I had to do it. Janet cooper is on board. You're flushing 27? How did you get in my head like this? It's not what you think. I will kill you! And this time, I will make sure you're dead. Does it look like I could hurt her, Even if I wanted to? This is not what's supposed to happen, joseph. To either of us. We devoted our lives to the program, didn't we? Because we believed in it, what their goals were, What they wanted to accomplish. Aren't you still devoted? Whatever happens, know it wasn't janet's fault... ...It was mine. You're up late, liam. Yes. Are you all right? Liam, you seem so distraught. You know I have been loyal to you all these years, director. Yes. Your dedication to the program, And especially to me, has always been appreciated. There's even a part of me That understands your obsession with janet cooper. It's not an obsession. It's - Love? I understand your disappointment. Unfortunately... That won't undo the damage you have caused To this experiment. So it's official? You've decided to red card the entire town? I had...Then I thought about everything - Including you. And I've decided to give you one more opportunity To preserve your role in this program. Thank you, director. What is it you need me to do? You'll know it, liam, when you succeed... Or when you fail. Nothing. I hope this doesn't mean we're locked up here again. I don't think so. Everyone else is either already up, or they're... Gone. You guys had to take the stairs, too? Yeah. Where's all the others? Where's all the furniture? Charlie and blackham are upstairs, I think. I haven't seen janet or joe. Right here. What are you, cozying up to the help? No, I'm looking for janet. Did you guys have to take the stairs down? You guys seen janet or ulrich? Not this morning. How about you? I haven't seen them since last night. Do you guys think they got out? Joe: Who knows? There's ulrich. Where's janet? Hey! Guys, you got to take a look at this. Something's wrong. Where the hell are they? Oh, god. Check the other buildings! The place is deserted, ulrich! What the hell is going on here?! Erika: I am not dying this time! Do you hear me?! Not this time! You have to stop playing with us! I am not dying this time! Erika, it's okay. No, it's not. It's okay. No, it's not, janet. You don't know what those things are, but I do! And you are not sticking me In one of those bags! Do you understand me?! Not now, not ever! Oh, my god. Body bags. There's only six of them. Joe: Yeah. 'cause only one of us gets out of here alive. What? Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com You explasince you've been now, here before. Why are these bags here? Why do you think? You're dying before me. Do you understand?! This guy knows what this game is all about. So it's about time we off his ass! Janet, even you think we can't trust him anymore. Isn't it about time we take things into our own hands? Yes. Who's responsible for the body bags? You? Liam: No. But you know about them. I feared they would appear. So joe's right. We're gonna die. Six of you will, yes. And you? Are you just gonna watch us die off, Or are you the one pulling the trigger? That's not how it works, janet. How does it work, then, liam? You kill each other. No. We've been doing this a long time. Tensions are already rising, aren't they? What about you? Can you stop this? Liam... You can't just sit by and watch them do this to us. I know that you've been a part of this for a long time, But I know - Liam, I've seen. There's more to you than just this program. You're right. There is more. There's you. You should survive this and be the last person standing Once all the body bags are filled. That's what the program predicts. I don't want to hear that. Liam, please. Can you save us? I'd save you... Only you. I'm not gonna leave without the others. That's what I thought you'd say. That's why you're probably going to survive This last crucial exercise. When push comes to shove, You'll end up doing whatever it takes, janet. Whatever it takes. Why didn't you tell me they expect us to kill each other? If I had, would you have believed me? But that's what happened before. I was the last man standing. At least that's what I thought before ulrich showed up. Why would people just start killing each other? Six body bags. People do the math. They start to understand that only one person will survive. You saw what happened in the sheriff's station. They will get the result that they want. Each of us, turning against each other, Doing whatever it takes To be the one who survives. And all the time we think that we're making the decisions. But it's all because of their manipulation. The program lulls you into believing That you somehow have a choice. The illusion of free will. Exactly. But free will doesn't exist here. You do what they want. Even if you don't know it. It just happens. So, that's what happened with you and me? You just did what they told you to do? No. And you know that. Ulrich offered to get me out. And I said no, not without everyone. That includes you. They're never gonna let me out of here alive, janet. Go with ulrich. He'll get you back to your life... Back to megan. I wish I could. Kat: I don't understand what we're doing in chinatown. Well, we need more information. We got the thumb... But now I want to know who used it to hitchhike. I gave it to a friend of mine. He's gonna come meet us.  and don't worry, he's used to this kind of thing. What do you mean, "used to"? There he is. Don't judge a book by the cover, huh? Who's the babe? Kat damatto. Your boss? Mm. Oh, far out. Do you know me? Only by reputation. Sherman golightly, oakland medical examiner. I know what you're thinking - I'm a dead ringer for those hunks on "csi." Hope you don't mind. I'm starving. Oh. Go right ahead. All I can say is you better have something good for us. More than you imagine. I found your thumb guy... And he's alive. Code word, please? I want to speak to the director. To do so requires a code word. That won't be necessary. Go ahead, liam. I'm ready to start the exit sequence. Very well. I'm clearly not suited for field work. It will be comforting to be back in the office again. Well, I'm sure we can find another position For you in the program. I was hoping I could return to my previous duties, Madame director. That, I'm afraid, won't be possible. But there will always be a place here For you, liam. Please, I - Liam, stop. We don't have any time. We have to go - now. Look, I told you, I will not leave without the others. I know, janet. Let's go. What's going on? Oh, my god. Liam: Joe, keep everyone close to you. Janet: Liam... What's going on? Janet, stay back! What's happening? All of you, stay back! Aah! Liam: Nobody - nobody go near him! Oh, my god, no. Oh, liam. Janet, no! Janet, stay ck. No! Janet: Liam! Charlie: Oh, my god! Blackham: His head exploded! Ohh. Ohh. Oh, god. Get him off of me now! Charlie: Bill, are you okay? God! No, I'm not okay! That could've been me, man! That could've been all of us. I can't believe they did this. That was the warning shot. Meaning we're all next? Yeah. Then they better come and get me. They're not gonna do anything. We're gonna do it to each other. Blackham: What? Ulrich told me they expect us to kill each other. Until there's only one of us left. Yes. Is that what happened to you? Yeah. Oh, god. It took less than a day. I can't believe that I killed somebody. That I took another human's life, but I did. Well, no one is killing anyone. They don't get my soul. We're getting out of here. Oh, yeah, how we gonna do that? You just see what happened to ulrich? I don't know, okay?! But we are - All of us... Together... Alive. This is what Liam showed me. You can see everything. Joe: Yeah. This is how ulrich kept track of us. Yeah. Yeah, and now we know what he saw... And what they see now... What they're paying attention to. Hey, erika just went off camera here. Try another button. Try to find her. There. Yeah, but where was she? She was out of camera range for a few seconds. "for a few seconds." Yeah. Dr. Gilman: Next thing I know, I'm here in san diego, Lying in this bed. I don't know how I got here. I don't even know what happened with my thumb. You claim that you were kidnapped By rebels in san nicasio. I worked with doctors without borders. We were helping out a village that suffered from a mudslide. We saved over 50 lives before the rebels took us over. Wait - a-a village? D- don't you mean like a 2-block town That has a hotel on it - a town? There was no town. There were slums, tents, People living in cardboard boxes! Poverty. Dr. Gilman, we saw you a week ago In a town that looked like 1950s middle america. You were in a body bag, dead. I don't know what you think you saw... But I'm here, aren't I? I'm alive. And this hospital helped save me. And they changed my life. They changed your life? I can't be a surgeon anymore, obviously. But they hired me to work here in the cancer-research clinic. I can still be of help. I had a vocation... But now I'm part of something even greater. Erika: And here we are. So, what? They were watching ulrich, as well. They knew ulrich could help get us out, Even before we did. Where did his body go? Why do they need to be here If they think we're gonna kill each other? To make sure we get the job done. Just stop it. Okay? I don't want to hear anyone talk about us killing one another. If they do have people here, we better not take any chances. None of us should travel alone. Agreed. No one should leave this room without another person. Fine by me. I pick mcnair. Sorry that doesn't work into your little plan, moira. Janet: Guys, they're constantly watching us. Paying attention to what we do. If they see us fighting, you know, Falling apart as a group, They're gonna know we're vulnerable. Listen. I can't afford to be beside anyone I care about in battle again. What are you saying? Y - you should stay with charlie? What? He'll take care of you. Graham. We both know what's been going on between us Wouldn't work in the real world! It's time we both wake up. Hey, moira. Hey, moira, it'll be okay! You and me. oh. Oh, that's great. So, I'm - I'm all alone now? Nobody said that. Come on, bill. Oh, "come on" what? Look, face it. These people don't give a damn about me. They probably want me around more than you guys do. Bill, we're on your side. You're gonna pick us, right? Charlie, you're a good man. Okay? Better than these idiots deserve. But I got to protect myself whatever way I can. Kat: Something about gilman just didn't jive with me. What, the fact that he was dead, then he turns up alive? No, it was the way he spoke. He said he "had a vocation." We've heard that before. Angela barragan. It was just typical press-release crap, Requests for donations. It says here it's nonprofit. Yeah, but in this age of hmos, What hospital is strictly nonprofit? What do you expect him to say - "affiliated with the program"? Shh, let me think. Um...Donations... Hmm. What? Oh, the new register. What does that have to do with anything? Maybe everything. Look. Hey, there, bright eyes. If you want my opinion, I think joe's still playing us. It's hard to believe I actually feel sorry for his lame ass. We learned a lot about each other in that vault, didn't we? Yeah, we did, bright eyes. You don't know how much I wish you wanted to learn more. No, erika. Erika, wait. Where'd she go? What about them? Where are they? Blackham! Oh, my god. Mcnair! Hurry! Someone's attacked blackham! Moira: What happened? Blackham. Where's blackham? he was gone when I got here. But we just saw him get killed. I mean, his body was right there - dead. It's locked. They took him. "they"? What's going on here? I saw you running in. Why do you guys all look that way? Where's bill? Charlie, he's gone. What do you mean, gone? That can't be. He's here. We just have to look for him. He's here somewhere. I'm sorry, but...We saw him get killed. It's your fault! It's your fault! All of you! You never gave him a chance! We all should have helped him! Dossette: It was on may 14, 1953, That the mansfield institute was established As an independent, nonprofit organization. The newly formed entity was dedicated To further promote scientific, educational, And charitable purposes for the welfare - We got all of this off of your website. What we're interested in is what you're doing now. Well, almost at once, The mansfield institute developed a unique style By blending scrupulous nonpartisanship With rigorous, fact-based analysis - no, no, no. How about a little less script here? Why don't you tell us about the institute's dealings in san nicasio? We saw the town that you created. We know what's done there. We know there are more towns like that one. We know about your relationship With ambassador franklin fairchild, About angela barragan, daniel gilman, About your dealings with the san francisco register. Um, please, I'm - I'm just a dossette, sir. I... You may be, but they're not. We're here, aren't we? We found you guys, all the way out here in iowa. We know you have my ex-wife! Sir, you're gonna have to stop that right now. If not, I'm gonna call security. Why bother? Where's janet? We know you have her somewhere! We know you have her here! I want to know where janet cooper is! What about victoria fairchild? What about father joe tucker? We know that you kidnapped them! We know about this institution! We know all about this organization! No! Mark: And we're not gonna give up, do you hear me?! We're gonna find these people! Impressive. Has anyone ever gotten this close to us? No. Never. Charlie: Why are we here?! Why are we here? If they're just gonna kill us, why are we here? You don't know that they killed blackham. They killed bill, we killed bill - it's all the same. They brought us here to die - for what reason? Would you shut up already? You sound like a woman. I'm venting! Is that all right with you?! Sounded more like pissing your pants. Hey, here's an easy one. Probably wouldn't have to kill him. He'll just die of fright. Oh, come on, you guys. You know, I might not be the bravest man, But at the end of the day, I'm worth something to some people. You're not worth spit, are you? Yeah, anything you say, chicken little. What'd you call me? Chicken little. 'cause that's what we called girls Who gave it up to the warden. Shut your mouth! Hey. Hey! Stop it! Stop it! Charlie: Shut up! Both of you - stop it! I am not who you think! Moira: Charlie? Charlie?! Charlie! Charlie, come on, wake up! Charlie? What happened? I don't - maybe a heart attack. Erika: Wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Charlie, wake up! Wake up! Stop it! Stupid son of a... Why'd you fight with me? Hmm? Why didn't you just ignore me? He's dead. Joe: What is this? Moira: Injection marks. Somebody did this to him. It's all I found. How old do you think these are? no idea. But if we get desperate, looks like this is all we got. That's the great thing about booze. It never goes bad. Hey, how's moira? In shock. Aren't we all? I don't know. You didn't seem too surprised, joe. Even janet noticed that. You're drunk. And you're beautiful. Where are you going? Out. Thought moira might need a shoulder to cry on. Erika, I don't - get off me. You had your chance. Earth to moira? It's a joke. Lighten up. Have a drink. Look, I get it. You know, charlie was an okay guy. He didn't really deserve to go like that. None of us really deserve what's happening. Hey, where's charlie's body? I asked you a question. Aah! It's not what you think. She killed charlie. You know she did. She probably killed - killed blackham, too. Graham. You got to believe me. Moira... Moira! I'll get her! I'll get her! I'll get her! Joe: What the hell? Janet: She's lost her mind. Graham: She hasn't. She's been trying to figure out where we are. If she killed erika, It's because erika tried to kill her first. She's not crazy! I know she's not. Keep away from me, graham. Moira! Wow. Don't touch me. I'll jump. Moira, please... I mean it, graham. You hate me, don't you? Moira, you know that's not true. Please, come down from there. All right? I'm sorry for what I said. Just come back to me. Come on, come on. Come on. Come back to me. Just come back to me. Come on. It's okay, moira. It's okay. I understand. I love you. Nobody's gonna do anything to hurt you. I'll protect you. I promise. That's what my father used to say. Moira, no! Moira, don't! Don't! Moira, don't! Aah! Moira... Where's mcnair? Gone. For good. You're next. What are you do- Aah! Unh. Moira... Moira... We're the only ones left. Kat: Well, at least they didn't arrest us this time. They didn't have to arrest us. We got no jobs, no credibility, Barely anything we can call a life. Unh! Oh! what are you trying to do, scare me to death? I want to get those bastards for what they did to her. What they did to us. So do I. Moira's body's gone from the hotel. Did you find mcnair's? No. Erika's and charlie's bodies are gone, too. The body bags. Yeah. There's only one. Yeah. I can't believe they're all gone. Where do they take them, anyway? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? I mean, the bodies were there, and now they're gone. It's like - it's like they never existed. Look, we need to stay calm, janet. They're probably coming to get us. So, then, what is the point in staying calm? These people behind the domes Are just watching us die! I don't want to die. I know. What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? I wish I knew. I could use a drink. How about you? It's not gonna solve anything. It won't hurt anything, either. Ohh. strong. What - Ugh. J- I'm sorry, janet. The program is in my blood, janet. It's my vocation. It will always be. I couldn't choose you. They would never allow it. Good work, joe. Finally... You have proven to me and to the program That you are worth saving. I tried my best, madame director. That...Was satisfying. I think it worked. I think they believed what they saw. No, erika. Charlie? Oh! All of us got out. Not joe. Graham. Graham, are you okay? Ohh. Took you guys long enough. www.addic7ed.com
