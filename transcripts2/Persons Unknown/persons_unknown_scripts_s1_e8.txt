 Persons Unknown (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 8 - Saved - full transcript 
 Joe finds himself strapped towel-only on a surgery table for equally painful physical healing and attitude adjustment, to be either reintegrated in the program or die, contending withs visions of people he cares for. The others are ever more confused, Bill so badly he doesn't even try running when he stumbles into an apparent way out of town. In South America, Mark Renbe visits in a mental institution Angela Barragan, their lead to the missing persons and the program masters.

 Previously on "Persons Unknown". I don't see it. Right there. You knew the cameras were here. I'm no longer one of them, Janet. Did they share videos of me screaming my daughter's name? This photo must have been taken after that. She may be alive. Where did you get this? The ambassador's safe. You think they're gonna watch passively while you piss all over the program? I'm willing to take that risk.

 We take Joe hostage. Joe is not the enemy. That's because you're in love with him. I'm not in love with him! Whose side are you on, bright eyes... his or ours? Your ex-wife and my daughter were taken by a very powerful organization. Whoever gets tangled up with them, their life will never be the same. He has photos of Megan. We found a rat in your hotel. Now, you know this is not necessary. One person has made it out alive. Where can we find her? South America.

 You'll leave Rome now. Take this. Aah! Aah! What did you do?! Aah! What do you want to do, Janet? I want to get out of here. We might be able to escape. [ Water running ] Joe? [ Echoing ] I'm dreaming, aren't I? I must be. I mean, you're dead. [ Echoing ] I know I am, but what are you? Come on, Joe. What happened to your sense of humor? Tell me the truth, Tom, please. Are we both dead? I am dead, my friend. But you... you're being saved. No. No. No-o-o-o-o!! [ Breathing heavily ] Tori: Good morning, Joe. I'll bet you're wondering why you're here, aren't you? Well, seems things have gotten a bit... Off-track, out of control. I'm afraid we're gonna have to fix that problem. A slight adjustment. Nothing more. [ Electricity crackles ] But I guess I should warn you... this is going to hurt. [ Groans ] [ Whirring ] Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Transcript by addic7ed.com [ glass shattering ] [ Breathing heavily ] It's time to stop, Janet. I need to know! It's not gonna bring him back. Just let me go! Not until you stop! Stop. [ Breathing heavily ] He was here. I... he... he was alive. I... I... Where did they take you? [ Indistinct whispering ] [ Groaning ] What is this? Formal re-education. [ Sighs ] Option one... you come back to the program. Option two... your body can't take the re-education. And... [ Groans ] Is there even an option three? You stay here until you're re-educated. As long as you're an asset. Until we decide otherwise, you know you can never leave the program. No one ever leaves the program. Ah. Aah! Aah! Meet your new family. Seven again? You know, why not eight? Or six? Mathematics, analysis of variance. Program's gotten us down to a statistical certainty. Seven works. Six or eight doesn't. Good to see you again, sir. Home sweet home. You remember? How could I forget? This is the room where I was reborn. Ask me what your greatest obstacle will be this go-around. My mind, obviously. No. Your heart. Come back, Joe. Is Janet really worth throwing away everything you believe in, Joe? Have you ever thought about the harm you might cause her, the harm you've already caused? You need to help us understand, Joe. Why her? Why now? Is there something we missed? Something that wasn't made clear? Something that made you turn against us in such an aggressive manner? Renbe: Is it just me, or does this place look more like a 19th-century gulag than the offices of a well-known humanitarian and surgeon? You know, normally I'd argue with you just for the fun of it, but I am beginning to wonder. Mr. Renbe? I am Raul Samper, the hospital's administrator. You speak English. Great. Not so great. I am afraid the hospital turned down your request to interview miss Barragan. May I ask why? Protocol. Protocol. It's your protocol that we can't interview a physician? Physician? Angela Barragan is a patient here. You did know that? Mm-hmm. Absolutely. That's... that's why we want to interview her. Angela Barragan has been living here for 25 years. She's categorized as criminally insane. She's a danger to herself and others. I am sorry. I cannot help you. No, no, wait, wait. I- I was wondering, uh... Does Angela Barragan ever tell people that she escaped something called "the program"? It's a multinational corporation. Corporation that locked her up here because she knows too much. Please. Dr. Barragan was a peace corps worker... Who poisoned the town's water supply. She handed out paper cups and told mothers and their babies God wanted them to drink. Now, if you'll excuse me. Look, I-I know you've got your protocol, but is there any way you can maybe, you know, like, uh... Bend the rules? It's important we talk to her. How important? [ Electronic whirring ] I'll see what I can do. Kat: Uh, he wants to know how long we're gonna be. Tell him we don't know. Senior, no se. Pero una hora, mas o menos. [ Speaking Spanish ] What? He said that [Clears throat] She has to wear a straightjacket because she likes to throw feces at people. You go first. [ Insects buzzing ] Ugh. Oof. Ugh. Show me your scars. Um... I don't think I have any. Everyone has scars. I'll bet she does. Ugh. Angela, my name is Mark Renbe. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions. Questions. Questions. Angela Barragan. Female. 59. Single. Aquarius. Lactose intolerant, although that doesn't stop them from putting cheese in my food three times a week. Did I answer your question yet? No. The question isn't about you. We're looking for this woman. We were told you may know where she is. She was taken by the same people who took you. Do you like sweets? Sweets? Uh... Yeah. Yeah, I guess. They don't serve them to the patients. No sugar ever. There's a shop... Near the Plaza de Las Flores. I used to buy churros for the children there. I want one of those churros. I know. Write it down. Avenida del Pilar, 211. [ Chuckles ] We got it. We'll do that tomorrow. Right now, I want you to tell me about this organization. You called it "the program," and you escaped from them. I don't know what you're talking about, Mark Renbe. But I was told... Kat: We got it. One churro, fresh. Estamos listos. What are you doing? She wants a churro, I have plenty of scars, and that room smells like death warmed over. I had more questions. Take a hint... whether it's because of that closed-circuit camera or something else, that woman, until she gets that churro, she's as good as mute. Charlie: Damn it. You dead yet? [ Chuckles ] Kidding. You know how Joe said that we were all selected to be here because of our potential? Yeah. So? Well, that can't be true. I mean, what potential do you have? [ Scoffs ] Doughnut hole. Bite me. Ah, there you go again proving me right with all that witty repartee. You can't think of a retort, can you? [ Sighs ] Aw, come on. You're not even gonna try?! Come on, Mr. Blackham! [ Door opens ] They may have eliminated him. You know, you haven't spoken to me since before Joe disappeared. Well, I don't know what to say. So, it does bother you... what I did... Killing that man in Iraq? Graham. Look, it's... It's a lot to take in. Do you think it was easy for me to tell you about my past? I haven't told anybody about what happened. You were the only person I thought saw me for who I am on the inside. Would you have told me if it wasn't for your dossier? I could have lied to you... Denied what happened, and you probably would have believed me. I know you would have believed me. I told you because I wanted you to know who I am... everything I am. I'm ashamed of what I did, but I did it. I'm not gonna run away from that anymore. [ Door opens and closes ] I trusted you. [ Sighs ] Tori: Come back to us, Joe. We need you. The program needs you. The world needs you. The way out is the way through, remember? [ Shouting ] Think of what you're giving up. Janet. Think of those who are depending on you... Is that you? ...All of them lost because of your selfish actions. Joe. How can you let her stand in the way of all the things you hold dear? I love you. This is not going to end well, Joe. Wait for me. Joe, you know you can't go back like this. You have to accept. [ Door closes ] Hello, Joe. Who are you again? You don't remember? Maybe I do. But right now, I need to hear you say it out loud. I'm Tori fairchild. Tori. You thought I was dead, didn't you? Maybe you are... And I'm just supposed to remember you. Why are you supposed to remember me? So you can give me the program's instructions. Mm. Good. I think you've been through this before. You know you can never leave the program. No one ever leaves the program. Tom: Come on. If we don't hurry, we're gonna be late. Let me guess... I'm meeting someone. Only a small percentage of subjects show the potential you've exhibited. Do you understand that, Joe? I have been waiting for this moment for a long time, father Tucker. It's just "joe" now. This is the director, Joe. She requested this meeting. Because you, Joe, are the future of the program. I feel that we need you more than any candidate in years. I see so much potential in you, Joe. Tell me... ...Are you the ultimate team player? I am. You are the future. Renbe: This is it... Avenida del Pilar. [ Indistinct conversations ] I'll go and check it out. Kat: You're not gonna believe this, but the owner of that shop said they've been in business for 40 years. This is the guy in the picture with Janet. Angela didn't want us to find a churro after all. Father Joe was a pastor here in San Nicasio for five years... Before he disappeared. Kat: You were here when it happened? Not when he was taken. All I know about it is what the locals tell me. Government agents took him from this church. They felt he was aiding the rebels. Was he? I don't think so. Someone gave me this. Father Luis, these aren't government agents. My God... blue-coverall guys. Where did you get this? So you agree it is Joe Tucker. Yes, yes. Is he alive? No. And I don't know these women. But I can guarantee you the man in this picture is father Joe. Father Joe, alive. This truly is a miracle. [ Sighs ] Mmm. Ahh. [ Groans ] Ahh. Unfiltered. Hey, just so you know... I don't care if this is a plant or not. Thanks for reading my mind. Mm. Oh. Mm. Hey. Join me? Can't. Busy. [ Scoffs ] Busy? Well, one thing's for sure... there is no "busy" here. Maybe I don't want to. Wha... it's... it's me. You can relax. You know, Blackham, for about half a burp, I thought you might be useful. You wanted to expose Joe. So did I. But, you know, now that Joe is gone, you really have no value to me. You're kind of like a boil on my ass that won't get lanced. [ Scoffs, chuckles ] Okay. Think about it. If you died, would anybody here give a rat's ass? [ Electronic whirring ] Yeah, well... You can go to hell. [ Joe groaning ] You're back. We missed you. You're a nurse now. I am what they need me to be. My father was right about this. Your father recruited you? I believe he did. The program has given me a purpose. I have a vocation. [ Scoffs ] Vocation. I had a vocation once! The program took that away from me! You hear me?! I had a vocation! Hundreds of people depended on me! This from the man who now wants Janet more than anything? How strong was your commitment to the church in the first place? [ Children laughing, shouting ] Joe: Who are you? Man: Joe, it's me. Nobody needs you to shoot me, Joe. What's going on? It's me, Joe. Put the gun away! You know who I am, Joe. Is this what you want?! Put the gun down, Joe, please! You want me to kill him?! Joe, you are a man of God! [ Gunshots ] Aah! [ Breathing heavily ] Who are you? Your mentor. You're ready to continue. Continue what? [ Electricity crackles ] You don't have my churros. 'Cause we know that's not what you sent us to find. My ex-wife was taken by men dressed the same way. So was the daughter of the U.S. ambassador to Italy. These men are part of the program, aren't they? They kidnapped you, didn't they? It never happened. Angela, if you know something, please tell us. My doctors told me that never happened. You... you said I wasn't kidnapped. You... you said I only imagined it. You... you... you told... you told me I never went to that town! You... you told me I-I was never a part of the seven! I was never indoctrinated into the program! Angela, who are the seven? Where's the town? I had a life... Before the program took it away from me. I had a life, and then they just left me here to rot! Aah! Aah! The town is the program! Let go! Help me! Help me! Help me! Find the town and you'll find the program! Are you all right? Angela: Find the town and you'll find... We got to get her out of here. She knows where Janet is. Yeah. Find the town and you'll find the program! [ Water sloshes ] [ Sighs ] You awake? [ Electronic whirring ] Yeah. You're probably always awake, aren't you? Are you gonna explain to me what this is all about? You know, you stuck me here with a bunch of crazy misfits that, personally, I really couldn't care less if they all slipped in their collective bathtubs. [ Scoffs ] [ Chuckles ] Oh. Look, um... I think you made a mistake. I don't have potential. Just look at my dossier. I'm a doughnut hole... Just like Charlie said. I got nobody at home, and, um... Nobody here who... [ sniffles ] [ Sobs ] Look, um... There's nothing special about me. Nothing. I think you and I both know that, so why did you have to take me? [ Crying ] I just want to go home, okay? Please? Oh, God, I just want to go home. [ Door closes ] [ Scraping ] [ Elevator bell dings ] Wait, wait. What are you doing? What does it look like? This is all useless garbage. All right, you need to stop, all right? Why, because this is gonna mean something? It won't. I don't want it up here anymore. I do. Just... just stop it! Stop. It doesn't mean anything. It only meant something when you thought it was important... ...When you thought I was important. [ Scoffs ] What are you talking about? I still do. I still do. I can't do that. Can you just go? [ Sighs ] Moira, please. I'm... I'm sorry... just leave me alone. Just...Go. [ Door opens ] If you only knew. [ Door closes ] [ Electronic whirring ] If you only knew. What the hell's going on between you two? Nothing. [ Door closes ] Tori: Time is running out. This supposed love you feel for Janet... it's going to destroy you. Can't you see that? Joe: I'm not giving her up! You are the future of the program. You hear me?! Not now, not ever! Let her go, or we will have to let you go. Are you... Joe: I'm not giving her up! Not now, not ever! We believe in you, Joe. Why can't you believe in us? What is your vocation? You are, Janet. Aah! I'm not giving her up! Not now, not ever! Aah! Accept this. Accept your fate, Joe. We need you. Aah! I needed you. Every second that I spend here, my daughter's at risk. We're begging you to let us help you. Aah. Aah! Listen to us. Listen to me. Isn't there anyone that you want to call? Ask me again when we're free. It's going to destroy you. It's going to... Aah! What is this? You tell me. What are you doing? No! I promise you, we're gonna do everything we can to get out of here. What are we gonna do? We've tried everything. Please, Joe, we don't want to lose you. Thank you. We don't want to lose you. We need you to come back with us. [ Breathing heavily ] [ Groaning ] Joe: There's got to be a way out. There's never a way out, Joe. The way out is the way through. You would never say that. You can never leave the program. You know that. [ Echoing ] You can never leave the program. In a couple of weeks, this should be completely healed. It's a good thing I turned when he shot. Otherwise, you'd be calling me "peg leg." [ Chuckles ] Janet's dossier says she's exactly what she told us. She's the mother of a 6-year-old. What did you expect to find? Joe's said that he arrived here the same day we did, so you can't believe what you read in those files. Janet's not one of them. I know it. Blackham's a better candidate than Janet. No. Blackham's too... Nothing. Yeah. Blackham's too nothing. You got that right. Moira: There. How's that feel? Good. Thank you. Geez. [ Grunts ] Come on! Geez, come on! [ Grunting ] [ Breathing heavily ] [ Sighs ] [ Wind blowing ] No way. [ Electronic whirring ] Oh, my God. [ Panting ] Where am I going? Nowhere. I'm going nowhere. [ Bells tolling, indistinct conversations ] Where is she?! You want to get me fired? Things like this happen. You already compromised my position here with the staff by continuing to ask about this. The woman was taken an hour ago. I do not know where or by whom. No one knows what happened to her. Believe me... I've already asked. Now leave me alone. Your dinero wasn't worth the aggravation. Hey. Hey! I'm here. Aren't I? I didn't go! [ Electronic whirring ] Look, that should prove something to you. [ Electronic whirring ] [ Bell tolling, indistinct conversations ] Kat, wait. Where are you going? To the police. Angela Barragan disappeared. If somebody took her, we're gonna find out who. The police? We can't do that. We're not even supposed to be in this country. We can't just let someone disappear. I don't care what godforsaken country that we're in. Wait, didn't you hear what I said? If we can find Angela, then we can find Janet. You've got to see that. I have to go home, Kat. I need to be a man, make a life for my daughter. We are so close, Mark. I have to believe that they took Angela because we are very close to finding Janet. You must see that. And, yes, Megan... she needs her father. She needs her mother even more. Yeah. We are gonna keep searching until we find Janet together. I'm not gonna let you stop till we find the truth. For Megan. For you. For us. [ Electronic whirring ] Tori: We have only your best interest at heart. To take away the pain, right? Don't let them destroy you. Cuerpo de Cristo. Don't let them destroy you. Don't give up, Joe. To cleanse you of the guilt. To make up for your father's sins. Janet! Don't move. [ Indistinct voices ] Never leave the program, Joe. No! No! Never. Tori: You must submit. Don't. No! Janet! Tori: Can you hear me, Joe? Janet! [ Gunshot, flatline ] He's crashing! Code blue! Hey! [ Gasping ] Aah! Don't give up! Do something! He's dying! Tori. Tori, can you hear me? Tori, I'm right here. I'm alive. [ Monitors beeping ] Am I really dying? You already thought you were dead. Yes. But I can't leave like this, Tom. You want to live, then. But you also want out of the program. [ Beeping continues ] So if I choose the program, I can live. There's no such thing as free will, Joe. You've proven that. You don't choose the program. The program chooses you. Always. [ Mechanical whirring ] It's time to go, Joe. [ Indistinct talking ] [ Wind blowing ] We won't see each other again. You don't know that. Oh, this time I do. Death is like that... final. Goodbye, my friend. Tori: Can you hear me, Joe? Can you hear me? Joe? www.addic7ed.com
