 Persons Unknown (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 9 - Static - full transcript 
 A desperate, physically healed Joe is returned to the gang, stark naked and suffering from amnesia, which the others doubt, arguing whether he's now a friend, asset or liability. The night manager fails to regain control and is beaten to pulp. The program's mean female director sends reluctant staffer Liam Ulrich to take over. In South America, Renbe and his lover-editor run broke but are bailed out of jail by a local clergyman, who gets killed during an escape into the wild.

Government agents took him from this church. This is director, joe. If you died, would anybody here give a rat's ass? Kat: We are gonna keep searching Till we find janet together. Come back, joe. Aah!

 If I choose the program, I can live. You don't choose the program. The program chooses you. You can never... Leave the program, joe. Never. Tori: No one ever leaves the program. Janet: [ in distance ] joe! Joe. It's me -- janet. It's gonna be okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. We should probably go back to the hotel. Moira: Where'd you find him? Outside. [ door closes ] At least they put a dress on me. Joe: It's cold. I'm freezing.

 Hey. Thanks. What happened out there, buddy? I don't know. [ door opens ] Blackham: Oh, hey. Joe's back. I just saw him from my room. He's naked as a jaybird. Can't say I'm glad to see you back. But maybe now we can get some answers? Joe... Where were you? I don't know. You don't know? Take a guess. Outside. In the cold. You were outside the whole time? Do you know what day it is? No. Do you think they did this to you? "they"? "the program"... Is what you called it. You know about the program? How? You told us. I- I don't know what you're talking about. In fact, I-I don't -- I- I don't know who you people are. Transcript by Addic7ed.com www.addic7ed.com I'd like to order some food to go. Number 47-- okra special. Excuse me. [ conversations continue ] I'd like to order some food to go. A number 47-- okra special. Open up. Tom! It's me! Where is the maitre d'? The boss? The head guy? I need to talk to him. [ man speaking chinese ] Are you saying he's dead? Look at me. Is tom dead? [ speaks chinese ] Do you want egg roll? Tom... What's going on? [ indistinct conversations ] Tom? Don't leave me like this. Tom! Right. Tom! Tom! [ keys clacking ] I made a simple request for a comm line To foxtrot tango niner. I was about to bring the director online, But I thought... "I'd better double-check." And good thing I did Because the request was not fulfilled. Do you think it would be a pretty sight For the director to find out That the comm office is not on task? Hmm? I will return to my station. If the line is not established before I get there, There will be downsizing... With extreme prejudice. Now, get on it. Now. [ wind blowing ] Just checking up on you. I'm fine. No, you're not. No, you're right. I'm not. Just when I think I've got a handle on this place And these people in the domes... Everything goes weird again. Listen to me. You are the strongest one of us. [ scoffs lightly ] that's definitely not true. No, janet. It is. Have you looked around you lately? Defeat's written all over their faces. It's how this place works it. It's even working me. I can feel it. I can feel it wearing me down. But, now, you... I bet you that's got them pissed off. I think that's why they dumped joe back here. It's just to mess with you. You're the only one they haven't figured out. You're the only one they haven't gotten to. Makes 'em scared of you. [ thunder rumbles ] God, I hate it here. You know what I want? What do you want? [ sighs ] You know that joint down on, uh, market street? Gleason's? [ sighs ] can't say that I do. They do a... Double-double cheeseburger with everything on it, And I'm talking everything -- Grilled onions, mushrooms, chili... The works. That's what I want. Good luck with that. You know what I really want? Even more than a double-double cheeseburger From gleason's? It's to be as far away from this mudhole of a country As soon as possible. Well, that makes two of us, mark, but... Our credit cards are maxed out, Our cells don't get any service here. We got about 200 pesos to our name. So, here we are. And all you're doing is reading the newspaper. For your information, I'm reading the want ads. [ laughing ] want ads? Mm-hmm. That's right. I speak passable spanish, I got a very good head on my shoulders And if I can get that tub to work, I clean up pretty damn well. So I figure, in a month, I can get a plane ticket out of here. So that's your plan -- to get a job? Something like that, yeah. So you can buy a couple of plane tickets? You got a better idea? No, but, you know... [ knock on door ] [ speaks spanish ] [ man speaking spanish ] [ speaks spanish ] Wait, wait, wait. What? It's just the hotel manager. [ speaking spanish ] Hey. Mark cooper? Also known as mark renbe? Yeah. You will come with us, please. San francisco authorities have issued a warrant for his arrest, And my country has agreed to let them take you back. What are the charges?! Two counts of murder and one count of kidnapping. [ kat speaking spanish ] Hey, joe... How's it going? Not so good. My name's moira, In case you don't remember me. Sorry, I don't. That's okay. But, listen, I wanted to tell you That if I can be of any help... If you ever feel like talking or... Going over what happened, I'm here. Thanks. Look -- what I mean to say Is when you are ready to share what you obviously know About why we've been kidnapped, Held hostage, psychologically abused, You know where to find me. If I could help, I would. But, honestly... I don't know anything. Well, that's interesting. So I would think long and hard about keeping up the charade, Because it won't end well. I guarantee it. [ elevator bell dings ] Are you finding the accommodations Satisfactory, sir? What? Well, if you need towels or sheets or -- [ electronic beeping ] ...Or...Ice, Or anything -- anything at all... [ beeping continues ] ...Ring my bell for assistance. Okay. Sure, thanks. [ elevator bell dings ] [ beeping continues ] [ rotary telephone dialing ] [ high-pitched beep ] [ high-pitched beep ] Front desk. How may I help you? You could start by telling me What in the blue halls of hell is going on there? I thought you knew. Uh, I assumed -- Were you or were you not Instructed to monitor joe tucker? I did receive a notice that he was returning, Um... But I thought that -- Thinking is not in your job description When last I reviewed it. Uh, yes. Don't talk. Don't move until the director is online. Okay. I said "don't talk." Three, two, one. Good afternoon. Is this working? Is this working? Can you hear me? Yes. Uh, good afternoon. Have you interacted with joe tucker? Mm-hmm. Some. Do you feel he's competent? Um... Yes or no? Uh, no. What informed your assessment? He's, uh, acting all weird. I'd like to speak to the ranking officer on-site Or someone with behavioral-observation training. It's... Just me...Now. Uh, there are no other officers... Uh, alive... At the moment. It's just you? The replacement hasn't arrived? Yes, sir. Just me. Keep an eye on mr. Tucker. Watch and report everything he does. We'll get back to you with further instructions. [ keys clacking ] [ sighs ] [ chuckles ] [ speaking spanish ] Sorry, I don't understand. [ speaking spanish ] Okay, there. [ chuckling ] Hey, hey, hey, hey! [ speaking spanish ] Renbe: Help! Help me, please! Help! Please! Renbe: Thank god! If I had any sense at all, I would just leave you here to rot. [ cell door closes ] Renbe: How'd you do it? [ guard chuckles ] Oh, let's just suffice it to say that I now believe That god truly works in mysterious ways. Father luis. I hope you know what it is That you are doing, young lady. This way. You have a very good friend here, my son. I hope you realize that. I do, father. I really do. We must hurry, If I am to get you across the border. Get in. Wait a minute. A- are these coffins? Yes. Get in. Everything appears to be Going to hell in a handbasket around here, mr. Ulrich. Why is that? There have been some miscalculations, No question about it. For the first time in more than a decade, We have the most promising candidate for the tenth level. And we have miscalculations? I have invested quite a lot of personal energy Into this project. We cannot afford any mistakes. As you well know, I do not share Your high opinion of joe tucker, director. You must never let personal feelings Enter into the equation. I taught you better than that. [ tableware clatters ] It's cold. [ tableware breaks ] I assure you, Everything is under control in that regard. Keep me posted. And take her with you. Perhaps you can find her something more suitable -- Refuse management, perhaps. Of course. [ door closes ] Personally, I think the joe thing is all good. How could joe coming back possibly be a good thing? He knows where all the buttons and levers are, And he's sort of on our side. Why are we still on the "us versus them" thing? You got a sweet deal here, guys. Why is everyone sweating it? I don't think joe is of any use to us One way or another at this point. Best to just steer clear of him, stick with our plan. [ scoffs ] really? We have a plan? Moira: No, I don't agree, graham. Joe may be our only chance at freedom. He's an asset. The question is how best to use him. If we come to the conclusion he's of no use, We eliminate him from the equation. [ door opens ] Hey there, joe. We were just talking about you. [ electronic whirring ] Hey. Just between you and me... I'm glad you're back. Are you? Yeah, you bet. You might not remember this, But you and I had a pretty good relationship going there... Just before you mysteriously disappeared. Did we? Yeah. I even took a bullet for you, pal. Right here. [ electronic whirring ] It hurt like a son of a bitch, I don't mind telling you. Sorry. I don't remember. Yeah, well... I do, and that's the important thing. What I'm trying to say is, you kind of owe me... And the way I figure it, It's just about time for you to come through. There's only chinese food here. Yeah, that's true enough, But if you just go back there, They'll make you anything you want. I hate chinese food. Hm. [ indistinct conversations in chinese ] Hi. Hi. I'm guessing you don't remember me, do you? What's your name? Janet. No. Doesn't ring a bell. Well, there was a time, not so long ago, that we were close. Or so I thought. Seems unlikely. Why is that? 'cause you're hardly my type. Well, you told me there was a way out. And you promised me That you would help us all get out of here. Try, if you can, to remember, joe. It's very important that you remember. Like I told you before, I'd like to help you. But I can't. You see those others in there? They want to beat the truth out of you. [ chuckles ] they're welcome to try. I don't know anything. Yes, you do. You said so and you meant it. A hole, a door, a secret code, an emergency exit. There is a way out of here. There has to be. Come on. Please. Joe, you remembered before. You need to remember now. Charlie: Janet! Erika: Janet! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey! You all right? Mcnair: Hey! What's up? Charlie: You all right? Mcnair: Let him go. You all right? Oh, my god. Look, I say we hunt son of a bitch down. Moira: Hey, easier said than done. No, it's pretty easy. We find him, we take him out. I'm more interested in making sure we're safe. Erika: Come on, mcnair. I've seen your file -- you're not exactly the type Who shies away from doing what needs to be done. There's a way to do things -- properly. I don't think we have that luxury...Sarge. Blackham: [ sighs ] you know, You guys can play this silly game if you want, But I'm gonna go upstairs and take a nap. Pressed duck makes me so sleepy. You're not going anywhere, blackham. Oh, no. You're wrong about that. Actually, I am. I guess you're entitled to your nap. Yeah, you got that right, sis. Of course we don't really know where joe is just now. Could be in your room, waiting for you. [ scoffs ] Oh, jeez. You just had to say that, didn't you? Look, we can't just kill him. Why not? What's the point of that? Look. Where I'm from, a dog goes rabid, We take him down hard and fast. Joe has value. Not to me. Janet: I agree. The sooner we find him, the better. Now we're talking some sense. Okay. Let's do it. Mcnair: Oh, hmm. Ulrich: Get me the night manager online. Oh, thank goodness. Did you actually call in a condition red? Yes, sir. I, uh -- You are not authorized to call in a condition red. Yes, sir. I know. I'm overriding your lockdown procedure. Uh, but... I thought I made it clear That you were to do nothing until you heard from me. Joe's gone rogue, sir. And the rest of the guests are organizing a lynching party. The town... [ sighs ] the town is not secure. I've barricaded myself in my office. Is that you whining? Because I don't need to remind you Of the time and energy spent on joe's reprogramming. The director thinks he's an asset. We don't want to disappoint her, do we? No, sir. [ keys clacking ] Where is joe tucker now? Um... I'm not sure. [ sighs ] Ohh. He's not registering on any of the sensors -- At least not on my system. I cannot provide you with support just now. You're gonna have to take care of this situation By yourself as best you can. I don't think I can, sir. You can and you will. Reintegrate yourself into the scenario. Find joe. I expect a full report within the hour. Erika: Where should we start? Okay, now we're talkin' some sense. Uh, yeah. [ conversing indistinctly ] [ charlie grunting ] You know, he's not gonna be in there. Moira: How do you know? Moira, he's not gonna be in there. There's no place to hide in there. There's no place to hide. If I hadn't seen joe tucker in that photo of yours With my own eyes, I would have never believed What it is that you're suggesting. A worldwide organization Kidnapping innocent citizens of their life. Heh. It seems fantastically impossible. Renbe: I know, father. Anyone that would have come to me With a crazy story like this, I would have tossed them out of my office. I wish I had. Although... There has been stories... In the villages from this area, Talking about strange lights at night. And then there are the, uh, azules. Who? "the blues"? But we dismissed it as amusing stories Told by poor, superstitious peasants, And nothing more. Where are these villages? How can we get to them? Oh! [ gunfire ] [ tires screech ] Come on! [ animals howling ] Man: Over here! This way! We're gonna die. Keep running! "reintegrate yourself into the scenario." Tell you what I'm doing -- I'm reintegrating myself right the hell out of here. Yes, sir! May I help you, sir? I don't know. Can you? Uh, perhaps I could interest you in the okra special. The okra special? Yes. Uh, the okra special. What is okra? Okra is a tapered green vegetable. What can you tell me? Nothing much, I'm afraid. How are you feeling? Like a jackhammer's working overtime in my head. Well, I'm sure it's just a temporary -- What week are we in? I'm not authorized to tell you -- to hell with protocol. I get dropped in the middle of a cycle, I want some answers. Begging your pardon, sir... But you've been here from the start. So it's true? Yes. I've had prior contact with these participants? Yes. Ohhh. Ohh. Tom. Is he... Dead. I'm afraid so, sir. And this woman... This "janet"... The one I attacked. I knew her? Yes, sir. You knew her very well. Perhaps a nice, hot cup of tea is in order? [ groans ] Charlie: Oh, my god. God! Is he alive? Oh, my god. He's done. Looks like your man joe's been busy. Blackham: Well, what do we do now? Okay, we got to get him inside. Ready? Everyone on "three," lift. One, two, three. Erika: We got to eliminate joe. Moira: No, we're not gonna do that. We got to get to him before he gets to us. Blackham: Why don't we just let them take care of this? Okay, on the bar. On the bar. No. I am not gonna sit around and let someone pick me off. Look out. Look out. Look out. Okay, towards me, on "three." One, two, three. We should have taken care of him before now, damn it. But this is exactly what they want us to do. Don't you see? Haven't we been manipulated enough? I mean, we're playing right into their hands. You know, it's because of you. Me? Because joe loves you. That's why they're doing this. Well, that's not true. I- I-it can't be true. Erika: Don't sweat it, bright eyes. You can't help being who you are. Why did joe go after this guy? I don't know. Give me a towel. Well, it doesn't change anything. No, but we can use it to our advantage. How do you mean? Nobody's using janet as bait. Look, if we lure joe out into the open -- Listen, bitch. Janet is off limits! We'll make sure nothing happens to her. But joe's got to be shut down And he needs to be shut down now. That's right -- it'll send a strong message to whoever's holding us. I agree, but we do this without janet. No. Moira's right. I'm the logical choice. You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. We'll be there. We'll watch your back, okay? No. He won't show up if there's anyone else around, So it has to be me. Only me. Talk to me, mr. Ulrich. Talk to me now. Steps have been taken To transport the night manager out of the town. The status of his condition? Critical, I'm afraid. Help me to understand How this unfortunate incident occurred. Things do happen, director. There is always risk. Clearly, not everything in joe tucker's reprogramming Was successful. There is an unpredictability -- That isn't you lecturing me, is it, liam? No. Of course not. Because I am well aware of all the risk factors In each of these scenarios. I designed most of them. But this is an error -- pure and simple. An error I hold you personally responsible for. [ keys clacking ] [ indistinct voice over p.A. ] It won't happen again. No. It will not. It cannot happen again. Do we have any idea where we are? Of course not. We have to keep moving, though. Spending the night in a south american forest Is absolutely something we don't want to do. That's for sure. Aah! It's okay. It's okay. A sleaze rag, fine, but I say that with pride. [ breathing heavily ] I had a pilates instructor Three times a week, And I had nearly paid off the 2007 bmw. I had a life. And you were tendentially a part of it. Tendentially? And now I'm hiking through the forest, Probably to help find someone Who you care about a lot more than you care about me. You know, we traveled to europe and south america. And crazed assassins are shooting at us, And if we escape, The world probably thinks that you kidnapped me, But I'm actually here of my own free will, Which means that I probably don't have a job to go home to. Kat. No. You know what? I need to know -- Are you really doing all this for megan Or are you still in love with your ex-wife? [ chuckling ] I'm sorry? You heard me. No! No, what? Yes. Ohh, that is not the answer I'm looking for! What I'm trying to say is "yes." For megan, yes. Absolutely. And, uh, to recover a certain sense of self-worth, you know? To make up for the lousy and selfish way That I left janet and megan. But there's only one woman I love, and that's you. And...I can't believe I'm saying this out loud, but... I don't think that I've ever loved anybody As much as I love you. You sure that's not just the hypothermia talking? No. You know, I can't be positive about that, But I'm fairly certain that I love you. Okay. I can work with that. I'm fairly certain I love you too. Janet: Joe? Joe. [ breathing heavily ] Joe. If you know what's good for you, You'll stay as far away from me as you can. Seriously. Don't come any closer... Or I'll kill you. Why? Why would you want to kill me? I don't. But they've done something to me. Something to my head. Then you have to fight it. I don't think I can. Stay there. There's only one way. No. Joe. No. Stay...Away from me. Please. Joe, if you do this... [ sighs ] No! No! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Look at me, joe! Joe! Fight this! Joe, don't! Fight it! Joe! Come back to me, joe! Look at me! Look at me. Look at me. Come back to me. Look at me. We're gonna get through this together. Together. Come back to me And we will leave this town together. You have to trust me. Okay? Please, it's just like you said -- The way out is the way through. [ sniffs ] Interesting and unexpected. I believe I had mentioned there was something... Out of the norm about her. You are right, mr. Ulrich. You are quite right. This deserves some rethinking. I agree. And a bit of extra attention. Absolutely. Which is why I'm sending you into the town. I don't understand, director. The scenario requires further observation -- One-on-one contact. And the hotel needs a new night manager. [ keys clacking ] [ elevator bell dings ] Erika: We'll take it from here. Janet: No, don't touch him. Nobody touch him. He's gonna be fine! He's gonna be okay. It's not your decision to make. It affects the group. The group's decided he's a danger. Erika: Just back away, girl. We'll make sure he never hurts you again. I said don't touch him. You have it your way, bright eyes. Come on. But sooner or later, that boy's gonna be the death of you. [ rain falling ] Tire tracks. Huh. How do we know these are not from those jeeps chasing us? I hope that they are. They at least know the way out of here. Yeah. That's weird. Very weird. [ chuckles ] www.addic7ed.com
