 Persons Unknown (2010–…): Season 1, Episode 7 - Smoke and Steel - full transcript 
 Now Joe is unmasked as one of the manipulators, Bill and Erica see that the gang abuses him horribly, despite his claim to have been 'promoted' years after his own abduction. Colleague Tom is ordered to extract him at gunpoint, but ends up fatally shot himself. Next the survivors find their elaborate personal files planted in Joe's room, and shortly after removed again. Stefano D'Angelo promises his organization will get Renbe and his lover-editor back safely, but it's Franklin Fairchild's connections who arrest them and the ambassador explains he's member of an omnipresent, almighty organization, invisible even to himself, which generously made his career and ordered his Tori's execution.

 You could have taken these cameras out at any time. It would've put you in danger. It would've stopped you and your pervert friends from watching. So, tell me, do you guys look up girls' skirts, as well? They take precautions to avoid prurient surveillance. Why - So they won't see me naked? Who cares? Did they see me crying, joe? Did they share videos Of me screaming my daughter's name? I'm sorry for what happened. You're sorry. I don't want an apology, joe. I want you to get me out of here. Well, i can't. I'm no longer one of them, janet. Yeah, but you were. Yes, i was, After i was kidnapped, Just like you, just like thousands of others. So, tell me, when you were on the other side, What were you people gonna do to us? Was it for ransom, or was it some cruel experiment? They're trying to do good. That is not an answer. Janet. Did you talk to him? Yes. Did he give up anything useful? Joe insists that he was kidnapped, Same as us, as were others just like us, And it's been happening for over 50 years. For 50 years? But who - Who is doing this? Is it some kind of political thing? I don't know, okay? He just said that it was for good reasons. Yeah, he says a lot of crap. Don't you guys see he's just telling us Exactly what they want us to hear? Joe: want to know the real reason? Well, i think you owe us that much. Truth is i only know a little. This place... this organization - Operates like a foundation or think tank, Devoted to peace and progress. They analyze vast amounts of information About the way the world is going, And they make bets based on that information - Intelligent bets. What kind of bets? Bets on people. My understanding is that people are selected Because something about them may suggest That they may grow to have great influence on the world. Well, that sounds really great, Except for grabbing people off the street and holding them prisoner. Yeah. But they believe they're - They're doing good. Hitler thought he was doing good. Hey, just let him answer. Bill: oh, are you kidding? Do you really want to hear joe spin on About what a great guy he is And about the wonderful people Who kidnapped us and trapped us here? Yes, i do, and don't yell at me. Hey. What? If you have a problem with me, don't take it out on moira. Oh, hey, i'm sorry, moira. Oh, my god! Blackham. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! Sorry son of a bitch! What are you guys doing?! Can't you see that he's just messing with us?! I'm trying to help. You hear me? I'm trying to help. Oh, yeah. I'm trying to tell you the truth. Oh, yeah, your truth, their truth. You want to know what the real truth is? You and your buddies are scum! And you guys - You're all scum, too, If you're actually gonna buy into this crap. It's the truth. Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com Why'd you come down here? Why'd you let me in? To say goodbye to a guy who used to be a friend. I'm not going anywhere. You think they're gonna watch passively While you piss all over the program? I'm willing to take that risk. It's not just you, joe. You're risking eight lives. You could force them to zero out this entire town. Eight? Yeah, joe, me included. God. Grow a brain, man. This is a vacation romance to her - Stockholm syndrome with a hot date. The second she's out of here, she'll dump you. You're not her type. It's none of your business. Yeah, it is. What am i supposed to do if they red-Card you? Disobey. No, joe, i'm still in the program, remember? You're the only person i still trust, tom. The suits hate me. So do the people in this town. Yeah, and whose fault is that? Anybody else? Yeah, i'll take one. You know, i think this joe thing is actually good news. How do you figure that? We can get out of here sooner. Right. No, look, listen, okay? It's simple. We take joe hostage. I'm sorry. What? Yeah, i'm listening. Hostage? We're already hostages. In a prison riot, The prisoners turn the guards into prisoners. Like you know. Oh, i know. And then the police move in, And they slaughter all of the prisoners. And besides, you already tried that strategy With the night manager. Yeah, and if you, mcnair, and joe Hadn't have stopped us, We'd all be home right now. I highly doubt that. I say we keep together, Stay alert, and keep our eyes on the enemy we can see. Joe is not the enemy. After everything that you found out, everything joe has done, How in the hell can you still defend him? Because i just know - I- I know that he's not the person that you think he is. That's because you're in love with him. I'm not in love with him! Whatever - The point i'm trying to make Is none of us is safe until joe's dealt with. Joe does not need to be dealt with. Whose side are you on, bright eyes - His...or ours? Ours! I'm on our side. You wanted to see me, charlie? Yeah. Got a minute? Sure. There's something i need to tell you. I don't need to get back to my wife... because she's dead. I'm sorry. Did you know that? No. Yeah. She died. And i wanted to die. Then you kidnapped me. Not me. See, i was kidnapped, just like you. Whatever. My point is that when charlotte was gone, Being abducted seemed like a trade-Up. It dawned on me That the kidnappers might kill me. And you know what? I didn't mind. I wasn't sad, exactly, just...done. I thought, "this is impeccable timing - I'm ready to die, and they're gonna kill me." But life is full of surprises, joe. Don't i know it. And the biggest surprise is this - I've still got a lot of life left in me. Being here may be the best thing that ever happened to me. Even with all the stock-Market gyrations, I'm worth roughly $80 million. Wow. I can get you anything you want - Girls, cars. Maybe you want a career, An education, world travel. What do you want, joe? What do you want, charlie? I want out...soon. What do you expect me to do? Anything you can. If there's a list, make sure i'm on it. You take care of me, and i will take care of you. You think about what you want And just know that it's yours for the asking... ...if you get me out. I've had people threaten my life, repeatedly, But i've never run from a bomb before. That explosion was something else. I mean, windows blew out a block away. I've been shot at. Shot at, shot over, bad guys falling dead all around us. I've never been kidnapped by thugs. You're a wanted man on two continents. None of this bothers you? Honestly, i've never felt more alive or more motivated To get to the bottom of this. Ciao. Ciao. Come stai? Va bene. Stefano: victoria bought that dress the day she went missing. This photo must have been taken after that. She may be alive. Where did you get this? The ambassador's safe. You broke into the ambassador's office... uh-Huh. ...and got into his safe? If we figure out who this guy is, Then we'll find janet and tori. Fine. Number 17. Still no match. My list has every person who disappeared The same day that tori and janet were kidnapped. All right. Who's next? I knew it! Che? It's the police. Well, they followed you here. What have you done? Follow me. This way out. Andiamo. Renbe, we split up here. You'll leave rome now. And go where? Anywhere, just don't use your cellphone, atm, or credit card. Take this. Go. Go. What's going on with the power? I was hoping you could tell me. Aah! We're just helpihey, you stayer his way out ofout of it, janet. No! Well, if he's not gonna turn off the pain wall for himself, Maybe he'll do it for janet. Aah! No! Oh! No! You touch her, you die. Come here! Stay out of the way, bright eyes. Erika, please. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, don't mess this up like you did last time, all right? Can't turn it off. We don't believe you. Open the damn fence, joe. I can't turn it off! Do it, joe. I can't. What if i can prove that what i say is true, That i can't?! Yeah, and how you gonna prove that? Does he have to die before you believe him? Wait. Just give me a chance. I'll prove that i am what i say i am! Please. Yeah, we'll give you a chance, joe. Yeah, but we're keeping you on a short leash. It's unlocked. What are we gonna do? We? Everyone else wants you dead. They would have gotten their wish If you hadn't pulled me out. Thank you. I don't know who you are anymore, joe. I want to believe you. I want to trust in you. You can. Can i? Yeah. That's why you saved me. I don't know why i saved you. I need to rest. Not yet. Walk faster. Ugh! Come with us now. Joe: tom, where the hell are you? I need to talk to you, tom. I know you're listening, tom. I need to talk to you. Don't freeze me out. All right, he's gone. Come on. I don't feel right about this. Yeah, well, get over it. Give me the key. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You're wrecking his room. Yeah, so? So there's no need because i've already gone through it all. Maybe you missed something. You know, guys like joe are good at hiding things. We should go. We're not done. Well, there's nothing here, so let's go. Oh, i get it. You think him and you still got - Look, i don't need to explain myself to you. We shouldn't be in here. Walk this way. Don't look back. You will be safe. Do not look at me. Keep walking. You kidnapped us. I saved your lives. You have stumbled into something Much bigger than you understand, So listen carefully. Once we reach the steps, You'll never see or hear from me again. We're listening. Your ex-Wife and my daughter were taken By a very powerful organization. For 31 years, i have been part of that organization. What's it called? It has no name. But when they found me, I was an apartment manager in bloomington, a nobody. They made me who i am. They expect me to do their bidding, and i comply. Is there anyone else like you? I'll take that as a yes. How many? Enough to exert a quiet control. We're never in your papers, mr. Renbe. We manufacture people and events that you report as news. Why you, ambassador? I never asked. They were incredibly generous to me, And i believed in what they were doing... until they killed my daughter, tori. My god. If they knew i was talking to you, We'd all be dead within a week - A heart attack, car accident - No one would ever suspect a thing. Are you willing to take them on? Yes. Good. Whoever gets tangled up with them, Their life will never be the same. One person has made it out alive. You? No, they still own me. Dr. Angela barragan. She's willing to risk her life to fight them. Where can we find her? South america. San nicasio national hospital. You must leave rome today. Good luck. So, what do we do now? Simple - We just book the next flight to san nicasio. Erika: what the hell is that? Mom! Aah! He has photos of megan... ...and my dental records. Canceled checks? These are private notes made by my psychiatrist. My whole life! Is something the matter? We found a rat in your hotel. I'll make a note of it in my nightly report. Hey, watch your head. Hey! Aah! Aah! Just try that again, and you will have a problem. Okay. Do you hear me? Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Now, you know this is not necessary. Oh, come on. Look, janet, we need to talk. Put your hands up to the bars if you want me to take off the cuffs. Janet... you didn't even ask me for my side of the story. Do you want the cuffs off or not? Look, i can explain what happened. You better work hard on that explanation. Some day i might want to hear it. Is that secure? It's solid. Let's go. Janet. Janet! Hey, you weren't reading those, were you? I didn't...much. Where are charlie and moira? We haven't found them yet. We should get them. I'll go. I'll come with you. You're a big fan of parolees. You looked at my file? It was by accident. You don't got nothing to hide. It says you ran a halfway house for guys on parole. It's on the dresser. Thanks. Some of those parolees, uh, They're the best people you'll ever meet. They just want a chance to prove That they can be part of society again. Hmm. A nice fundraising speech. It's too bad you blackmailed them Into kicking back their salaries to you. No, i never in my life - Please. It's all right. I ain't gonna tell anybody... ...as a favor to you because i like you. Okay. But i'm gonna ask for a favor in return. And you better do it. Okay. Well, my life looks like one failure after another. Well...could be worse. I got a look at mcnair's. Well, what'd it say? Just that, uh... but i'll tell you the rest later. What? What's wrong, moira? What is it? Erika saw your dossier. And? She said that you killed people for money. Erika told you this? Did you - Yes or no? It's not that simple. That means yes. Why is it so damn dark in here? Charlie? Cherry cola from 1983... made with cane sugar, the way god intended. Thanks. Yeah. Some of the others have been talking about you, Something about you keeping files on us? Those were planted - The people that are holding us. They are some slippery bastards. Do you believe me? I do. You carry yourself like a trustworthy man. I also believe... your characterization... of the group that's holding us. I don't agree with what they're trying to do, but... you do. And i respect that. If i let you go, I want your word that you're gonna try to do Everything you can to get me out of this place. I'll do what i can, charlie. Thanks. Yeah. Go to your room, mr. Morse. Tom. Now. What are you doing? This doesn't involve you. Go. Charlie, it's okay. We're going to my office. This is it. I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't listen. You were just begging to be red-Carded. Keep walking. You don't have to do everything they ask you to do. But the program saved my life, joe. I know it did. I remember when i came in. Man, you were this smart, optimistic guy, Out to change the world. It was infectious. I wanted what you had. And now you're gonna kill me. Is this what you wanted to become? Do you think i want to do this? No. We were friends, man - Close friends. And you threw it away. Janet's the best thing that ever happened to me. Did you see how quickly she turned on you when i planted those dossiers? She'll figure out it was deception. Meanwhile, you'll defend the program Right up until the minute it destroys you, tom. Shut up. Shut up. Go. Go. Walk. Ah! Aah! Charlie. Charlie. Joe: charlie, charlie. God. Oh, hurry. Hurry. If he dies by your hand, you are a dead man walking. You hear me? Yeah, i know. I know. Oh, god, it hurts. Okay, we can control the bleeding, all right? But you're getting a little shocky. I need you to take a breath. Can you do that for me? Inhale and exhale. Okay. Okay, let's go. He's not stable yet. He's stable enough! Get up, joe! Get up! Listen to me. You hang in there. You keep breathing. Okay, okay. You keep breathing, okay? Okay, okay. You fight, okay? Let's go. Okay. Come on. Let's go. My mother lives in portland, maine - Deborah allen tucker. Write her a letter. Tell her i died. Say it happened in an accident. Go. Go. Okay. Tell her we were friends.

The airplane boards at 1:50 at gate 51 on concourse "c." Ma'am, uh, we still need the tickets. One moment. Please wait. Be cool. We're tourists - Happy tourists leaving beautiful rome. Andiamo, per favore. This way. Come on. Bill: what the hell happened? Charlie got shot, but he's gonna be okay. One of the chinese guys is dead. He's in the kitchen. Whoa. You want to talk about it? Okay. Have you ever had a close friend die in your arms? No. My first month in baghdad, It happened to me three times. Army lab determined that it was all the same bomb maker. One guy killed my three pals. No one knew who he was Or where he was. Then one night, this contractor guy - Mercenary - Takes me to dinner. He says he has someone he needs removed. I tell him i don't do that kind of thing. He says it's the bomb maker. He shows me one of the triggers they found. They know who he is and where, And there's 100 grand if i take him out. Did you do it? Did a good job. Later on, i found out The guy i killed was an accountant. He was going to testify against the mercenary's company In an embezzlement trial. He was no bomb maker - The father of three little girls. Kind of snapped after that, Did some things i'm not proud of. Then i wound up here. Be happy, we're tourists - That was really just a great plan. So, you got strip-Searched, too? I feel completely violated. What are you doing here? Can you get us out of here? Yes, if you do everything i say. We're listening. When i leave here, these guards outside Will take a very profitable coffee break. Go directly to your gate. Do not stop for the bathroom or for food. Go to the immigration. Get in line number 3. Officer conti has everything. Line number 3, officer conti - Do we need to know anything else? No, that's all. Don't miss your plane. Good luck. Ladies and gentlemen... ...welcomes you aboard flight 905, bound for san nicasio. Our flight time will be 9 hours and 25 minutes. We ask you to please take your seats, fasten your seat belts, So we might push back from the gate concourse. If there is any way we can make your journey more pleasant... woman: signore. ...please do not hesitate to ask. Charlie told me the chinese guy planted those files. It's true. It was right here. Well, he also told me That you threw over this whole program because of me. That's true. Aah! My back - Ohh, it's still messed up. Put a hot towel on it. I don't know what to do anymore, joe. My daughter turned 6 last week. And i wasn't there for her. Megan has no idea where i am Or if i'm alive or dead. And she's gonna carry that scar for the rest of her life. I hate the people that did this to me. And i should hate you, too, joe, for being one of them, But... i don't. That's the hardest thing of all. What do you want to do, janet? I want to get out of here. Tom's death left some holes. We might be able to escape. It's gonna involve hard work, and it's risky. We may die in the attempt.
