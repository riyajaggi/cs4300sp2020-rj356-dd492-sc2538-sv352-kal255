 I didn't know what - we - we don't need to talk about it. We're gonna have to at some point. But not now. Look, you're in danger, janet. Yeah, well, I'm beginning to get used to that. Something's gone wrong, and I've put you all in danger. How? I don't know, exactly. But they're gonna - they're gonna take action - serious action. Joe, wait. We have to warn the others. No. Joe! How you doing, there, joe? You guys all need to listen to me. No, actually, we don't. What you need to do is pay close attention to us. There's no time for this. You're all in danger. Joe, I'm sorry to say this, but this routine is becoming very, very tedious. Just listen to him. Janet, the time for that's over. good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And how are we enjoying our stay? Who the hell are you? Liam ulrich, the new hotel manager, At your service. If you'll forgive me, I've been instructed by the management To secure the stairs to the roof. Liability and all that. It's very good to see you again, joseph. Been a long time. you know him? Yeah. But I thought he was dead. Dead? Why? Because I killed him. Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com I'm afraid I have a bit of bad news. Can't wait to hear this. Because of the recent events - And I doubt I need to point them out to you - The management has found it necessary to make some... Modifications in and around the town. Modifications? What does that mean, exactly? I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say. Is that so? Are you flushing the town, liam? Flushing the town? That doesn't sound too good. Now see what you've done, joseph? You've unnecessarily panicked your friend here. I assure you, there is no need for concern, None at all. As I was saying, because of this necessary maintenance, You will be restricted to this floor For a short period of time. And I'm afraid the security shields will have to be employed. This is for your own safety, of course. As a token of their appreciation For the inconvenience this will cause you, The management has placed a complimentary gift In each of your rooms. Room service will be available 24 hours a day. You'll find the menu next to the bed. If I can be of any further assistance, I trust that you will not hesitate to ring me. How do you know this guy, joe? And why did you think he was dead? Because I shot him through the chest three times. I even gave him his last rites. Last rites? That means you were - A priest. Yes. Jesuit, actually. That explains a lot. Not why you shot him... Father joe. Same scenario as janet. I got a fortune, same as all of you. It said, "kill your neighbor, and you'll go free." Unlike janet, I shot my neighbor dead. Mcnair: So, you failed the test. There is no success or failure here, Only results. I thought you all would've understood that by now. There's a lot of things we don't understand here, joe. There's certainly a lot of things We don't understand about you. When you said they were gonna flush the town, what did you mean? Things get out of hand, They feel the scenario has been corrupted... They terminate the cycle. So, what, they just put us back into our old lives or something? Erase our memories? No. They don't do that. What, then? They terminate us. Afraid so. What the hell are they doing? What the hell are we doing? Remember what angela said? The town is the program. Angela was insane. Body bags. Oh! Anton. "for class president." Charlie: Oh! "s.E.C. Investigation... "charges of corruption... "the prime suspect is c.E.O. Charles morse. "his mysterious disappearance "coincides with multiple charges... "of embezzlement. Continued on page 14." Page 14?! Where's page 14?! It can't be. You're not gonna believe this. These yahoos give me one page of the "chronicle"! One page! This is by far The worst torture I've had to endure. Idiots. What have you got there? Nothing, okay? Just leave me alone. It's none of your business. It's a football? Yeah. They gave you a football? Yeah. Well, that's a laugh. Yeah. You know, when I was little, Kids used to call me "lard ass." Yeah? All I did was watch tv and eat. My parents didn't know what to do. Then, on my 13th birthday, My dad announces that I'm playing football. Football. can you believe it? Oh. Toughest part was coach trump. Guy made my life a living hell. The running. The push-ups. Two-a-days in the August heat. I mean, there were times when I thought I was gonna die. But you didn't. In high school, I played guard. Banging heads in the trenches. So, in my senior year, We're in the championship game. There's like 45 seconds to go on the clock. Third down on the 7. Quarterback calls a double-reverse. Everything's totally cool... Till the wideout fumbles. Ball flips into the air, right into my hands. Everybody's grabbing at me, clawing me, But I make it into the end zone and hear this crunch. My knee was gone. But I didn't even care. I didn't even feel it. In the locker room, The team awarded me the game ball. Billy "lard ass" blackham got the game ball. Oh, man, I thought I'd lost it. Now here it is... Along with coach trump's obit. That's quite a wonderful story. Yeah, well, that was, uh - It was a long time ago. Maybe you're not such a doughnut-hole after all, bill. Miss winston. Thought you might be interested in having your bible back. To remind me of who I was? To remind you of who you are. You must be surprised to see me. Actually, I'm... Glad to see you. Glad to see you alive. Really? Now, see, that surprises me. I assume they sent you to keep me in line. Not everything's about you, joseph. I'm here because of janet cooper. Janet? The director has shown a great interest in her. It seems you are no longer her fair-haired boy. I never asked for that. Never asked for any of this. And yet here you are. Just so we're clear, I've been tasked With bringing janet through the process here. You are not to interfere. We'll see about that. If you do interfere, I will not hesitate To put a bullet right between your eyes, joseph, Not even for a nanosecond. I am not the man I was when we were in level one together. Neither am I, liam... Not by a long shot. So, you're a priest? Not anymore, no. Try as I might, I can't seem to figure you out, joe. Trust me, I'm not having an easy time of it, either. So, how did you get here, then? They took me, same as you. I was in the middle of giving communion, If you can believe that. But I-I'd lost my way long before. Couldn't live up to the vows. I was - I was ready to go. So, vows - you mean, like, celibacy? Celibacy - it's funny. I always thought that'd be the hard one. No. Obedience. I can relate to that. So, you're celibate? Yes. Wow. I- I mean... No sex ever? Not for a very long time, no. Joe, I'm not even sure I know how to process - Sorry to interrupt. Room service. I didn't order any room service. I took the liberty, joseph. Remembering how much you loved the cuisine Of your adopted country of san nicasio... Carnitas... Just like that sweet, young vendedora used to make. What was her name? Gabriella, hmm? Hmm. Excuse me. Janet. Janet. My god, joe. Can't you be straight about anything? Bastard. Just trying to be of service, joseph. What in the hell are they doing now? It's not good. They're all over the place. I know. Grand irony, this is. What? I grew up in a small town just like this - pemberton, montana. I never took you for a small-town girl. That's 'cause I did everything I possibly could To exorcise it out of my system. And now it seems I'm gonna die In a town just like I was born in. Listen to me. I'm not gonna let you die here. I spent my whole life getting into trouble. Somehow, by hook or by crook, I've managed to get out of it. now, look at me. We're gonna get out of this - alive. Okay? Good evening, mr. Blackham. Hey, there. Oh, man! T- bone steak, baked potato. I hope it's not too rare. The bloodier, the better. Our pleasure. Oh, and, by the way, thanks for the, uh, trip down memory lane, You know, with the football and the coach's obit. That was great. From the article, it seems coach trump was an inspiration to many. Well, he certainly was to me. Oh, man. Mmm! Enjoy your meal, sir. Oh, um, this isn't, like, a - A last meal or anything, is it? nothing of the kind. The management has seen A great potential in you, mr. Blackham. Just like coach trump did. Okay, well, if you say so. But, you know, I mean... Oh, my god. This is the best damn t- bone steak I've ever had. I'll tell the chef. He'll be most pleased. Oh! Just one more thing. Yes, sir. Charlie morse? He didn't get his entire paper. I wasn't aware. Well, just, you know, if you get a chance To see if maybe you can find it, I know he'd appreciate it. I'll see to it immediately. And thank you for bringing it to my attention. You bet. Come in. Courtesy of the management. it's a beautiful scarf, moira. Really? You like it? Very much. It's interesting that they knew A scarf like this would mean so much to me. I got something from them, too. What? My mother used to "educate" me with it almost every day. "it's for your own good," she'd say. "gonna beat that devil out of you," she'd say. Last time she brought it out, I was 14. I grabbed it right out of her hands And started using it on her - You know, more times than I could count. I took off running with it. Threw it in the river. Never went home again. You rang, miss? Yeah. I want you and your bosses to know That this is one bitch that can't be bought. The management simply thought you'd appreciate knowing How well anton is doing. Yeah, 'cause he's not with me? Quite the opposite. Anton is doing great because he's your son. You know in your heart that what I'm saying is true... Teresa. What'd you call me? Teresa. Teresa randolph - your given name. Don't worry, miss randolph. Your secret is quite safe with me. The others don't need to know That erika was your cell mate. Just... Stop right there, if - If you know what's good for you. Think about it. Just a few short weeks ago, you were lying on a table, Receiving a lethal injection. You were dead. And now you are alive. But not free. But alive. One life ends, another begins. Hey! A thousand apologies, mr. Morse. Mr. Blackham brought to my attention That you did not receive the rest of your paper. Yes. Yes, that's right. Blackham brought it to your attention? Yes, sir. He was most insistent that you get the rest. Oh. Very well. There's this article... Accusing me of embezzlement. I'm sure it's all some messy misunderstanding. Oh, well, they've had their knives sharpened for me For a long time. Because the company was charlotte's father's originally? I married charlotte because I loved her. Of course. And I worked my ass off for the old man from day one - Weekends, holidays. I quadrupled his damn business. We're in markets that crusty bastard couldn't even dream of. Where's the gratitude? Yes. Exactly. Excuse me. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. "a source at the s.E.C. Indicated last week... "winding down... "confirmed last night... "after an exhaustive search, "s.E.C. Investigators... "were unable to link charles morse To any type of embezzlement." I'm innocent. The investigators searched every memo, Every check stub, every e-mail, Every wire transfer that they could find. "they could find"? Encryption software grows in complexity With each passing day. You'd be stunned at the digital rat's nest A talented security consultant can install in 6.3 hours. Thank you. Please let me know if there's any other way I can be of assistance. Yes. I will, yes. Oh. Would you please thank mr. Blackham for me? Of course, sir. Good night. What are you doing in here? The management likes to call it "site improvements." Special service... For our most special guests. Why? Is it not to your liking? No, it's not. In fact - Please stop! As you see, janet, The management has had its eyes on you for quite some time. They have always believed in you, Even when you didn't believe in yourself. Will there be anything else? No. I- I - no. Very good, miss. We are ready to proceed. All the participants have been sedated, And I have the alpha unit standing by. Very good. I want to make it absolutely clear, liam, That everything must be done in the most expeditious manner. Of course. Everything will be completed by the morning. I wish there had been another way. I hate when extreme measures like this need to be taken. I understand, madam director. It will be fast... And painless. See to it, then. Mark, no. Sorry, kat, I have to. Damn it. My god. Yeah. He's a male, uh, 40ish. Oh. This is a woman in her late 20s. No, it's, uh - it's not janet. If only you had any idea Of the plans in store for you, janet cooper. If only... Kat: It's another woman. She's in her 40s. Mark, look at this. The right hand over here. Renbe: Where's her right thumb? It's been severed. His thumb is missing, too. Oh, god. Agh! No! no! Let go of him! Kat: Stefano. I followed the black jeeps.Here? But how'd you get to san nicasio? I followed you. Hey, we're here for the same reason - To find out the truth. Victoria's not here. Yeah, well, neither is janet. Those dead bodies and severed thumbs - It's a horror show. Yeah, about the thumbs... Why do they collect thumbs? They don't. I do. You cut off their thumbs? Yes. Aw, come on! How else could these bodies be positively identified By the authorities a thousand miles away from here? Genius. Thanks. I try. Come in. Bill: Hey, charlie! Hello, bill. Hey. Hey, have you had a peek outside? Oh, yeah. It is a beautiful morning. I know. In fact, I've been outside, sort of jogging around. I thought it'd be smart to try and get rid of some of this, Maybe get back into shape. sounds kind of stupid, huh? No, no, not at all. In fact, I may join you tomorrow morning. Really? With your leg and all? You know, that's the odd thing, bill. I woke up this morning. It feels 10 times better. I don't know why. You know what? I woke up this morning feeling pretty damn good myself. Go figure that. Join me for breakfast? I'd like that. All right. I- I'd like that very much. Where is she? I assume you mean janet? Liam... Where is she? What have you done with her? You never cease to amuse me, joseph. Always playing the righteous hero. Always failing miserably. Just like with gabriella, your little carnitas girl. Look, I don't have time for your crap. Where is janet? I believe she went down to breakfast Along with the others. Bill: I think I may have one of these deals. Charlie: You take the whole lobster? Heck yeah! Any chance we could talk? Not sure we have anything to talk about anymore, janet. I'm sorry for hitting you. I didn't mean it. Really? Seemed like you did. It was an accident. No, the real accident Was choosing joe over the rest of us. Yes. I'm beginning to realize what a mistake that was, So can I sit down? Yeah. I guess that would be okay. So, you're all right? I'm fine, joe. I'm in the middle of a conversation with erika. I- I just wanted to make sure - Can't you take a hint, joe? She doesn't want to talk to you. What has ulrich told you? He didn't tell me anything. It's what you didn't tell me. And I could fill a book 2 feet thick With what you haven't told me. Amen to that. I tried to tell you - just stop, okay? I keep wanting to trust you, But you just can't help being what you are. What? What am I? You're one of them. And no matter how hard you try, they've got you forever. They've got all of us, janet - every single one of us. Just speak for yourself, joe! And if you don't mind, Erika and I would like to finish our breakfast in peace. Let's go! Ugh! Man: The door! Stefano: Go, go, go. Go! Moira: This scarf belonged to my mother. She used to wear it every Sunday to church. Everyone would tell me how beautiful she looked. She was beautiful - my mom. My dad was the pastor of the church, And he used to say that she was The most beautiful woman in ohio. And he looked so proud whenever he said that. That was important to him, that kind of thing. I always wanted him to feel that way about me. So... When he started coming in my room at night, At first I was just grateful for the attention. One night... I saw my mother watching from the doorway. She didn't do anything. She just stood there. I strangled them both in their sleep. I did. I used this scarf. This very scarf. Now it shows up in my room. And your mother's belt. Why? What are they trying to tell us? We don't have to run anymore, moira. From our past... From ourselves... ...From what's ahead. Maybe. Slow down. My car is up ahead. They're right up our asses! Kat, get this to the right authorities. Man: Freeze! Now! Freeze! Hands in the air! In the air! Hello, boys. What seems to be the problem? Excuse me, janet. Yes, mr. Ulrich. There's a call for you. Is that a joke? Not at all. You're welcome to use the house phone if you like. Or would you prefer to take it in your room? Here's fine. I'll be in my office If you need any further assistance. Hello? Woman: Janet? Mother? My god, you're alive! Where are you?! I don't know. I was kidnapped. Should - should I call the police? The fbi? Yes. Yes. Call both. Is megan with you? Do you know if she's all right? Yes. She's fine. She's safe and fine. But what about you? Have they hurt you, baby? Have they? No. I-I'm okay. My dear, sweet baby is alive. Oh! I'm so happy. Oh, you are? I've missed you so very much. Even before you disappeared, I missed you. I did some horrible things, Things you didn't deserve. I'm so very sorry. I thought I lost you forever, baby. I love you, janet. I love you so much. Mom? Janet? I love you, too. Find your phone call to your satisfaction? It went a little too well. It probably wasn't even my mother. I assure you, that conversation was completely authentic. What, so after all these years, My mother just suddenly admits all her faults And tells me that she loves me? Why would she do that? Perhaps because you're a different person now - To her. So, you were listening to our conversation. Well, I'm afraid I'm instructed by the management To monitor all guest communications, But I must tell you... I was quite moved. Moved? Yes. That little girl in the closet, Clutching to her lovey, waiting to be rescued, Finally seems at peace with herself and her mother. Why do you think that is? I don't know. Pardon me for saying this... But I think you do. If there's anything else I can do for you, Please don't hesitate to ask. I'm always at your service, janet. Always. Talk to me, liam. Everything seems to be going according to protocol. Is it? Yes, I believe so. Yes, definitely. She's gotten to you. No. Please, dear. I've been doing this a long time. I assure you, madam director, That I am as objective in the case of janet cooper As I am with all the guests. And joe tucker? There's nothing I need to do in that regard. Joseph is as self-destructive as ever. Quite sad, actually. May I remind you That he is just as important a component As any other participant? Frankly, I'm weary of reminding you To leave your personal feelings out of these procedures. I assure you, my only interest Is in seeing this cycle completed With a positive outcome - For all the participants. Then I'll leave you to it, liam. www.addic7ed.com
