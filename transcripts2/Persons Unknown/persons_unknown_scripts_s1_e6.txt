 You put us both in danger. So, now what? I don't know. I'm guessing it won't be good. It seems so peaceful sometimes, doesn't it? Especially in the morning. It's like some normal, everyday town That you'd drive through and.. Never give a second thought. Only it's not. Has he done anything unusual? Everything joe does seems normal, Routine - Almost too normal, too routine, As if he knows he's being watched.

 Well, we are being watched 24/7. Watched by us. Like he knows he messed up somehow. Like when I saw him in the elevator. And afterwards, when he conveniently returned To the bank just as the vault opened. So, what do we do? Keep watching. Renbe. you just can't leave well enough alone, Can you, mr. Renbe? What do you want? Now you've managed to involve your girlfriend In this unfortunate pursuit of yours And, as a consequence, put her at some risk, as well. I trust you value her safety, Even if you seem to have a complete disregard for your own. Kat? Aah, you bastard! What happened? What does it look like happened?! These guys - they came guys dressed in blue? What? H-how am I supposed to - Were they dressed in blue?! I don't kno- yes, I guess they were in blue! Yes. Got to get out of here. No. Just grab your bag. There's no time to explain. Hey! Come on! Oh! You two better come with me. They usually travel in threes. Transcript by Addic7ed.com What the hell is going on? The only thing you need to know Is that if you stay in san francisco, You're gonna end up as dead as dead can be. How did you know that those guys were gonna be at my apartment? You want my help, you're gonna have to stop asking questions. Just stop the car! Now! Stop it! Would you just listen to me?! You can't deny there are guys in this city That want to kill you - kill us! Listen to reason. Your boyfriend and I are trying to protect you. Now - stop the car! Now! What the - you okay? Won't be long before they're onto your trail again. You just hit her in the head with your gun! You weren't gonna do it. Woman wouldn't listen to reason. I took the liberty of swinging by your apartment And picking up your passport. I got hers, too. Traffic's not too bad. Should be at the airport in an hour or so. Airport? Flight to rome's in four hours... If they don't find you there first. What I want to know is what the plan is. The plan? Yeah, about the new girl in town - This erika chick... The psycho bitch Who'd snuff you as soon as look at you? She just needs a little time to adjust, like we all did. Well, I'm not waiting around to get my throat cut while she gets adjusted. You are quite the piece of work, mr. Blackham. Yeah, well, laugh all you want, But, uh, you don't know what her game is. I mean, does anybody even know Where she is right this second? I'm right here. What are you doing in there? Making myself some breakfast. Oh. Just like that, huh? Just waltz into the kitchen and make yourself breakfast? Something like that. Never did care for chinese food. You know, the boys in there will make you anything you want. All you got to do is ask. Is that real american bacon? Mm-hmm. Take a whiff. You mind if I... Get your own. Hey, guys? Hey, there, badass. How's it going, erika? Outstanding. Is that bacon? Yeah, you want some? I dream about bacon practically every morning. Help yourself. Whoa, that is good. That is so good. What's your problem, blackham? You and your girlfriend here - that's what. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Ow! So it's gonna be like that, huh? Fine. I've seen enough women's-prison movies To know what that look means. And look, look, look. She likes it. Oh, god, just what I need right now - A love triangle. Ha ha. Did you hear something from up on high? Oh, I got an earful, all right. And? Nothing you need to know about. Thanks. Look, they'll respond soon enough. Don't you worry about that. Until then... You're needed on deck. Just love giving me grief, don't you? It gives me more pleasure than you could ever imagine. Go. Now. Go. I need to get some things from the grocery store. They just got everything right here, don't they - just for the taking? Uh, yeah, they do. Everything except a ticket out of this place. Do you want to come? Actually, I think I'm gonna take a bath. Okay. It's been a while since I could do Whatever the hell I want whenever I want. I'll see you in a bit. Sure. Damn. Hi. What's on your tiny mind this morning, mr. Blackham? We're never getting out of here. Never, ever. You think so? I just realized I'm gonna be stuck with you losers For the rest of my godforsaken life. Mm. Since I got here, I've been beaten, berated, treated like I'm some clown. Well, your behavior Hasn't exactly been exemplary, mr. Blackham. Yeah, well, I'm not exactly sure what that means. But I'm not who you think I am. Who do you think you are? Someone who's fed up with the way things are, Someone who's tired of being everybody else's monkey boy. Someone who's not gonna take any more crap From the bozos running this place! Hey, you got a sec? What's up? It's the weirdest thing. I thought that elevator was broken, you know, Stuck on the first floor? I'm pushing the buttons - nothing. So I'm getting ready to hump up the stairs, And then - boom - doors pop open. There's your man, joe, Standing there like there was nothing wrong With the elevator or anything. Joe's not my man. And that elevator, I mean, it shows six floors, And there are only three. It's - It wasn't the freaky elevator that got my attention. It was the expression on his face. What expression? Likee got caught doing something He wasn't supposed to be doing. Joe's a good guy. Maybe. I don't know him the way you do. What are you trying to say, erika? I'm not trying to say anything. I am telling you that that man has got "snitch" Written all over him. No, you've got the wrong guy. I don't think I do. Now, you call it intuition, You call it a sixth sense you develop over a 10-year stretch Of looking ov your shoulder, But that man has got something to hide. I'll be keeping my eye on that boy of yours. I'll see you around, bright eyes. Don't you worry. Like I said, I got your back. She became convinced she was a fairy princess Who accidentally stumbled into this world of humans. So every morning for nearly a year, She stood outside, Next to the pond in our backyard, With her eyes closed, waiting, I suppose, for the fairies to bring her back to her world. And even after she became an adult, I could still catch a glimpse of that fairy princess, Never quite believing that she was really part of this world. And, boy, I'll miss her. I'll miss her smile. I'll miss the time that - Liar! You made her life a living hell, and you know it! Who are you? How can you stand up there and pretend to be anything But the murderer of your own flesh and blood?! Let him go! Huh? Everybody, drop your weapons now, please. For tori's sake. Mark, what the hell? Hey! Hey! Hey! Excuse me! Mark. Hold up! I want to ask you a few questions! Hey! Oh... It's a shame such a beautiful woman Should have such a burden as him. Yeah. Are you insane? You speak italian. Things aren't bad enough That you have to go chasing a bunch of thugs? That guy knows something. We have to talk to him. Oh, there is no "we" here. Kat, listen - No, you listen to me. You pull me onto a flight going to rome, With a splitting headache, courtesy of your pal edick, And then you drag me to a funeral, Where a bunch of thugs almost open fire. Oh, and then you decide to chase them... Like some nutbag, And you expect me to be involved in all of this. If you could just hear me out. Unh-unh! I'm going to tell you what I'm gonna do, mark. I'm getting on the next flight home, And when I get there, I'm calling the police Or the fbi or the friggin' cia, And I'm telling them what's going on. And then I'm going back to my therapist To try and figure out why I have such lousy taste in men. Look, I'm - I'm sorry I got us involved in all this, But now we are, and no one is gonna help us get out of it. We're in danger. We're in serious danger, And that guy - he's the only lead we have. Damn you, renbe. That there's something a little weird about joe, But I don't see how him going into the elevator Suddenly makes him a suspect. The numbers didn't move. Still... And he came back to the bank Within seconds of the vault opening. That's hardly conclusive evidence That joe is somehow involved in all this. We should keep our eyes open. What is going on? Ah! I just destroyed every stick of furniture in my room! You smellin' what I'm cookin' here?! Aah! Ha ha ha ha! Okay, from now on, there's two groups of people - Group "a" - Ready to fight the powers that be. Group "b" - For bitches, Satisfied to settle in and catch whatever the man pitches! Aah! So, you'll just be going around randomly smashing things? Oh, who knows? Maybe I'll burn all my clothes and walk around naked. Don't do that. Don't do that. No. From now on, I'm gonna control my little corner of this messed-up place We're trapped in. You guys should try it. Control is power. And power... Feels pretty damn good. Just the man I wanted to see. Really? Why is that? Oh, after you. Who are you? Just a guy. Really? Uh-huh. Kidnapped in the middle of his life. Wondering who you are. Oh, I'm definitely somebody you got to be concerned about. That's for certain. That's great, but, see, the rest of us all got here together. You show up in town right after tori disappears. That kind of concerns me. That's some classic snitch strategy there, mr. Joe. Flip the doubt onto somebody else, right? You may have the others fooled, but not me. Not me. Just so you know. And stay away from janet. You hear? I got dibs. I was hoping you'd help me find him here in rome. Come on, somebody must know where he lives. No, no, I don't know who I'm messing with. Why don't you fill me in? wait, wait. Everyone is afraid of this guy. Yeah, and I have four good reasons why. He's been arrested for assault And drugs and gambling and extortion. Damn. They found us. Come on. It seems your brother continues to attract trouble, huh? Yes, he certainly does. Unfortunately, your burden has just become ours. Please... Come with us. Are you okay? You don't look so great. That sweet-and-sour pork didn't sit well with me tonight. Of course, erika staring daggers all through dinner Didn't help my digestion much, either. I noticed that. Has she said anything to you? Why? There's something about her that I don't trust. That's funny, because she said the same thing about you. Like what? Well, you don't say much, joe, And it's easy for someone to think That you might be hiding something. Even you? Yeah, even me. If I were to tell you everything about me... ...I mean, everything... Would that help? I mean, would it help you to trust me a little more? It might, a little. Yeah. What do you want to know? What, just like that? Pretty much. Where are we, joe? Ugh! Ow! Joe? Ugh! Ow! Joe? Oh! Oh, oh! Joe?! Oh, man! Are you okay? Ow! Joe? Ow! Ugh! Somebody help! Look, I'll be fine. I just - I just need some water or something. I'll - I'll be okay. I'm okay. You getting the party started a little early, there, joe? You just been boozing it up all day? I don't drink. If you say so. Are you okay? Uh, no. There's something not right here. I just need to lay down upstairs. I'll come with you. No, I'm okay. I just - I just need to rest. I'm okay. I'll be okay. Okay. Ugh. Come on, tom. Give me a break here. We're journalists. I don't believe you. Just look at our I.D.S. Anyone with a laser printer And a laminating machine can make an I.D. Trying to track the disappearance Of an american woman called janet cooper. And I care about janet cooper because? We think her kidnapping is linked To the murder of tori fairchild. How is that possible? In the sense that the circumstances Of their disappearances are similar. How are they similar? I, uh... Hmm? Look, I know it sounds weird, but... ...There are these men... Dressed in blue. Guys in blue? Yeah, and somehow they're linked To some kind of, uh, I don't know what - Some kind of organization or something. Organization? Look, I- I know it's thin. It's paper-thin. But I also know That I've stepped on one of their nerves. How? I'm not sure. No? But they're doing everything they can To make sure I don't get too close to the truth. Now, what exactly is the truth, as you see it? I'm - I'm not sure. No? I did a little checking up on you. Calling yourself a journalist, mr. Renbe, Is a bit of a stretch, don't you think? And the san francisco register Is better suited for wrapping fish in than reading. Hey! Such a newspaper as yours Can hardly afford to send journalists To rome on a wild-goose chase, no? So I'm gonna ask you one more time... Hey, no! ...What is the real reason you're here?! I just told you! You told me nothing! For god's sake, mark, just tell him the truth! Good idea, if you value your life. All right. Speak! J- janet cooper is, uh, my wife. My ex-wife... And the mother of my daughter. He's telling you the truth. He has video comparing both abductions. Just give him a chance to show you. No. Ugh. Joe? Joe. Huh? Hello, tom. Come on, let's get up. I'll get you some water. Oh, god. Here. Oh. See what you got me doing? Breaking protocol. This is it? This is their response? I don't know. I don't. It's a little gutless... Of them, isn't it? Using poison? Why not a firing squad? Or something out in the middle of the town? This - this - oh, this is - This sucks. Listen, I wish I could help. I know. Situation must play out. Joe, I can't pollute the program by interfering. No, we wouldn't want to do that. I've committed my life to this program, joe. And believe that there is no single life more important Than the greater good this program serves. You used to believe that, too? Remember? Yeah, I remember. I'm sorry, my friend. I really am. Yeah, me too. Victoria was very alive. She was very special. We were very much in love. Her father didn't see our relationship As anything but trivial, And he did everything to break us up. When he learned that... We were planning to elope... ...Well... She disappeared. And now she's gone. See, I've been tracking these blue guys, As you call them, too. You really think that the ambassador Is responsible for all this? Frankly, fairchild is capable of almost anything. I have a hunch you might be right about the ambassador. Well, at the very least, He's connected to whoever is behind this. Perhaps we should go on a little fishing expedition At the embassy. I don't think this is food poisoning. Then what? Some kind of toxic agent. I'm not sure what. His pulse is racing. Meaning what? He was poisoned? Moira: That's what it looks like to me. Well, from what? And by who? Well, that's pretty obvious, isn't it? The weasels behind the domes! What kind of poisoning? I don't know. There's no way to tell without tests. Well, there's got to be some kind of antidote around here somewhere. Yeah, the trouble is, if we give him the wrong one, it could make it worse. I'll go check out the drug store, see what there is. Someone should go back to the restaurant, Check out the food, if there's any left. I'm so on that. All right, come on, let's let him rest. I'm not gonna leave him. There's nothing you can do. Trust me. She's right. Come on. Hang in there, joe. Come on, hang on. Please, joe. Oh, please hang on. How's he doing? Not well. How you doing, bright eyes? Suppose I was wrong about him. What does it matter now anyway? I didn't mean to cause you any grief, janet. That's not what I wanted to do. What was it, then, that you wanted to do? What, exactly? To protect you. I don't need protecting, okay? Not by you or anyone else. May I help you, father? Uh, I just want a word with the ambassador, my son. I'm sure you will, in time. Patience, father. I'm still working at that. We all are. Yo, easy there, father. We got enough enemies around us as it is. Not to mention the security here is tighter than fort knox. Oh. Let's relax and enjoy the buffet. I'm not hungry. Yes, you are. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. Hmm. Are you all right? Sorry. Yes, thank you. Can I call you a doctor? No, no, I'm okay. You sure? A chair would be great. Oh, father, thank you for your concern. I'm okay. Ambassador... Our parish was so saddened To learn of your daughter's passing. It was quite a tragedy. Uh, thank you for your concern. It, uh, has been a difficult time. Yes. Take this. Oh, thk you. Checkpoint 3. Clear. Who are you? I mixed up two antidotes. Okay, great. Not exactly. This one will cause joe to vomit in about three minutes. But if the poison is chemical-based, It could cause more damage, even death. This activated charcoal could absorb the poison, Or it could interact with whatever is in joe's system, Causing a worse chemical reaction And killing him instantly. So they could both save him, But they could both kill him. This is horrible. Nobody deserves this. You hear me, you sadistic bastards?! Calm down, calm down. Okay, well, we've got to try something. Try this. What is it? Vodka. What? Vodka? I seen these same symptoms before when I did time. Girls used to poison themselves Making moonshine out of antifreeze. Ethylene glycol. That's it. She could be right. The alcohol would neutralize the antifreeze. Okay, well, it's worth a try. Give it to me. Not so fast. Erika, what are you doing? Hey, joe! Hey, joe. You still with us? Earth to joe! I got a little something for you. It's gonna save your life. Here's the catch. You got to tell us the truth. What are you doing? She's getting the truth. Come on, give the man the cure. Oh! Ow! Ohh. Ugh. Here it is. It's a simple yes-or-no answer, joe. Are you one of them? Ugh. Don't look at her! You look at me! Now, you answer my question. Are you or are you not one of them? That wasn't so hard, was it? Is he - is he dead? What difference does it make? Well...Because if he isn't dead... And he's one of them... Then I'm gonna kill him myself! Hey! Hey! Oh, god! Ow! Ohh. If he's one of them, he's of no use to us. Except for information. Or as a bargaining tool. All we have to do is search every chinese restaurant Between rome and san francisco. Mnh-mnh. I'm going home, mark. I have a job. I have a life. I am done with this whole thing. You know, watching you just spend every waking moment Obsessively searching for your ex-wife And dragging me - I mean, literally dragging me... You're still fired, in case you were wondering. Fair enough. Renbe? Mm-hmm? Look. We're locked in. Come on! Well, hey. Hey. Hey, wait, wait, wait. Ohh, I'm fine. Slowly. Okay. Thanks. What happened? You don't remember? Not everything, no. Do you remember what you told us? Do you? Yeah. I remember. I gave you so many opportunities To tell me the truth. I'm sorry. I wanted to. I trusted you. I did it to protect you. Don't you dare give me that crap. Are you or are you not Working for those bastards behind the camera? Yes. What are we going to do with you, joe? Here's to us, bright eyes. www.addic7ed.com
