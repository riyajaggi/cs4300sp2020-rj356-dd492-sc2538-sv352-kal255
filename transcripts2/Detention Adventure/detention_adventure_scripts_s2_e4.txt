 Look. It looks like someone was trying to cut out the page, but then ripped out the rest in a hurry. Who could've done that? (KNOCKING) (MUFFLED YELLING) It's Kelly. (MUFFLED YELLING) - What is she saying? - I have no idea. - (MUFFLED YELLING) - We can't hear you! KELLY: Security guard!

 Run! Hurry! (GRUNTING) Bre Go. (DOOR RATTLING) It's locked. GUARD: Hello? I know somebody's in here, okay? You are trespassing and you are subject to criminal penalties. Two break-ins in one day. I never should have quit Popeye's. Risking my life... in these basements.

 I miss the sweet smell of chicken. (DOOR BEEPING, OPENING) HULK: Guys, wait. Something's got me. I'm gonna call my mom. Through the door. This is a dead end. We're stuck. Let's just be friends, okay? This is a church. We're gonna need a miracle. Okay, uh, we could... (STAMMERING) Yeah, I got nothin'. Man, this is worse than ghosts. That's it! This place is supposed to be haunted. Grab that colander. Let's not do anything Jesus wouldn't do. (GASPING) I can make you a chicken sandwich right here in this kitchen. (SCREAMING) (WHIMPERING) JOY: Go, go! (PANTING FEARFULLY) (GASPING) (SIGHING) I'm going back to Popeye's. (WHIMPERING) Run! I'm so sorry. I shoulda been in there with you. Is everyone okay? Yeah. Yeah. It was awesome! The lookout is an important job, and you nailed it! There's definitely room for... for improvement. You did great. Did you hear what the security guard said? Someone else was here today. There was two break-ins. I saw someone... in a red cloak. Did you see who it was? No, their face was covered and... I got scared and I ran. Failure. Who could have known we were here? Oh, I don't know. How about the whole world, Logan Paul Junior? Okay, too far. We need to go somewhere to examine the book further. My parents are gonna be distracted tonight. We'll have privacy at my place. Bre Okay. I bet your house is so chill. (LOUD RAP MUSIC PLAYING) This is huge, them winning a championship. (LOUD RAP MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Put it in when to roll, when my line of credit goes ♪ Hey! You're late for the Raptors ceremony! Championship rings, anyone? Oh, yeah. Thanks. Don't mind if I do. Thank you. Don't I get one? Oh, yeah. Of course. Hey! Nice reflexes, like a cat. Whatever. Sugar is bad for your teeth and your personality. ACE: Hey, nice goal the other day at practice. Thanks. What is this? We play for the same Pelicans Lacrosse team. You play with my sister? This is exactly why I didn't want to tell you because clearly you'd be mad. I'm not mad. Who's mad? I'll be in my room, getting rich, and you are coming with me. Ahh, okay. Oh, she's definitely mad. Wow. This is so cool! Is it an important game? The Raptors are the only non-American team to ever win the NBA Championship. They're gonna raise their banner and give everyone their rings to celebrate their win. This is a historical moment happening right now. Shh! Hey, it's starting. (CHEERING) ANNOUNCER: We are live from Air Canada Centre in downtown Toronto. We welcome you to the Raptors... - History now? - ...championship ring ceremony. ♪ Trophy on my wall, big ring around my ring finger ♪ Would you rather get Cockshutt's treasure or win one of those rings? Definitely the ring. I think it's worth way more. That was incredible. Who knew sports could be so enthralling? What am I doing watching World War II re-enactments? Trust me, after a few games, it'll feel like you're watching the same thing on repeat. No, I think there's a uniqueness to every game. Can we just focus on the task at hand, please? Aye, aye, captain. - Are you two okay? - BOTH: We're fine! You know, I'm feeling kind of jealous right now. Usually I'm the one who sparks your anger. You're still number one. Okay, it looks like it's in alphabetical order, starting from... 'C'. This last entry here was 'Coburn'. Do you think the next would be Cockshutt? Yes! Ignatius had a son named William Cockshutt, who married Minnie Turner Ashton around this time. There must have been something important on that page. Who would do something like that? Looks like there are some indents on the page. We could try doing some pencil rubbing and see if we can make out what it says. Does that work? Oh, yeah. I do it all the time, especially when Ace rips out a page in her diary that she does not want me to read. You know she does tutoring with a student named Joe? I think it's a little bit more than that. - Oh, I know Joe. - Joe who? "Joe Mama". (ALL LAUGHING) That's a good one, Mr. Brett. What? "Congratulations, Ace. You've been accepted "into a grade 12 placement in Vancouver"? (SCOFFING) Here! "William!" I knew it. Wait. What? Who's Aisling O'Faolin? I thought you said he married a girl named Minnie? Fake news. This doesn't make any sense. William never married someone named Aisling. I'm sure it was Minnie! Maybe he had a secret wedding because he's just such a big, stupid, secret keeper! Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Why? Hmm. Look. There's a weird star symbol and a poem. Ugh! Why does it always have to be a poem? Why can't it just be "X marks the spot for the big treasure"? "Congratulations," "you won yourself a pair of new sneakies." Where's the fun in that? That's it. We found our next clue. "Watched over by an angel's gaze, "a home by any other name," "a sister's care, a job anew." "To cover up a brother's shame." Maybe "a sister's care" is referring to Ignatius' sister Jane? That makes sense. Or one of his daughters? Cockshutt had nine kids. That's way too many Cockshutts for one Cockshutt. What's "a home by any other name"? A house? A castle? No. A condo? Oh, good ye, the good ol' 19th century condo. What's up, Breakfast Club? Oh, you know, maybe none of your business! Maybe that's what's up. And for the record, Kawhi leaving was... not cool and totally rude, and anyone who says otherwise is just... a big, freakin' liar! - Raign... - He go! Wait. Raign! - What was... - Wait. You know, I actually think he gave us the greatest gift he could, a championship. He earned every right to leave. Board Man gets paid. What?! Ugh! Are you gonna follow me all night? I think yes. Do you want to talk about it? No. I just want to figure out this riddle. That we can do. HULK: Maybe. Okay, Detention Team, what do we know so far? Cockshutt's land was Indigenous land. Fact. William Cockshutt had a secret marriage. Fact? Someone is getting to these clues before us. Fact. The new star symbol we found s right there in that window. Fact. Wait. What? ♪ ♪
