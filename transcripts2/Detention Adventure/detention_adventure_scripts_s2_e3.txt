 You're driving me to meet Raign at Coffee & Shake, remember? Oh, sweetheart. I completely forgot. It's fine, I put a fifteen minute buffer time in case of traffic. No, see, the thing is, I... I kind of have a date... What? With someone. You have a date? How am I supposed to get to the east end, then? I don't know? Take the bus. Public transit? Are you crazy? Kids take the bus all the time.

 I'm going to be late for my adventure! ♪ ♪ My teacher would say... ♪ What are you doing? I can't stand country. Here we go again. I was listening to that! Well, we were listening to something else. Oh, it's we versus everybody? You really need to get a hobby! I'm sorry. Haven't you seen the papers? Getting in trouble is my hobby! No, no! Raign! I'm trying to listen to my music. - Mom, I'm want to... - I'm listening to something! Hey, hey, hey! That's enough! Both of you stop it. Raign, you know Ace has an important tournament today and we're already wasting enough time driving you on your little coffee date. Ew, Mom! It's just Hulk, and I'm sorry I'm so inconvenient. No. You're not inconvenient. You're selfish. Oh. You know what? That's it. I'll walk. Don't worry about it. Wait! - (HORN HONKING) - Geez! Hey, crazy driver! (HORN HONKING) Idiots! Get out of the way! Dad, you were looking at your phone. No, I was not. You had your finger on it. I was closing the message to not be distracted. See? Responsible. Hey, I don't have rehearsal this Sunday, if you want to go, like, watch a movie or something. (GROANING) I can't big guy. I got to work all weekend. Right. Oh, hey, look at that. Your mother and I got married in that church. Oh, yeah? Where did you guys get divorced? I'm just curious, in case I ever want to get a divorce. Right, well you don't do it at a church. I'm sure by the time you get divorced it'll all be online or something. ♪ (PANTING) - Ow! - Sorry. These are so sharp. It's stabbing me in the head. Joycelina, your grandmother purchased that headdress. It would be a great honour to be stabbed. Can't I just wear the Cracovian dress again for History Week's. Heritage Ceremony this year? Joycelina, you know we alternate between Polish and Indonesian every year. Oh, I know, and it's confusing. People laugh at me. Those who laugh should be cancelled. (KNOCKING) Joy! Thank God you're here. Can you give me a ride? Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Jayadi. - We need to move. - Hm. Have you guys ever been on a bus? Yeah, it sucks. (CAR ENGINE TURNING OVER) Treasure hunting is gonna be so much easier once we have a driver's license. KELLY: Hola, mi familia! Are you all having a good day? My day's been great. I watched this re-enactment show on the History Channel about the Nazis stealing the Spear of Destiny. Super interesting. How did you get here? Oh, I live right over there. Well, we're all here so... So, let's break into that creepy church. I was gonna say that. ♪ (DOOR CLOSING) Do you think it's actually haunted? HULK: They say this church reveals your greatest fears. Do ghosts really exist? Let's see what our viewers th... RAIGN: Brett! Stop posting! We don't want people to know we're here, and you're perpetuating rumours. This place closed because people stopped attending. My Gran said that this church was used for the Underground Railroad. Escaped slaves from the South were routed through here through the 1800's. Peoples' greatest fears were getting caught. That's right, the Tuscarora tribe used to help them escape up the Grand River to Brantford. Man, new Hulk has her facts down. Did you know that churches were built over wells so when people sang, it created an ethereal feeling? But it was just accumulative acoustics reverberating off of the water. Doesn't everyone know that? (BRETT CHUCKLING) Let's test that theory. Ricola! (RAIGN SHUSHING) (GLASS SHATTERING) (GASPING) (GLASS TINKLING) We're supposed to be sneaking. You're lucky that's all that fell. - (CHAIN SNAPPING) - (GASPING) - Get down! - (SCREAMING) (CRASHING) Ow. (COUGHING) I'm gonna go look in the basement. - I'm coming with you. - I'm following Mr. Brett. (SIGHING) KELLY: Wait. Are you okay? I think I'm just going to look around up here. Are you sure? I'm fine. I'm fine. I just think someone should be on the lookout. Okay, good call. I'll let you know if we find anything. (ELECTRICITY SPARKING) JOY: I think we should split up. Bre Good idea. RAIGN: I'm going this way. (GASPING) Whoa. Ran away. Slave boy, Robert Porter. Fugitive slaves in Canada. Bre You know, I wonder if you and me would have been friends back in the day. I mean we're both kinda similar. Rebels, misunderstood, Dads with important jobs. At least yours took Sundays off. You must believe in ghosts, right? (GLASS SHATTERING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (RATS SQUEAKING) (GASPING) (SIGHING) Hello? (BEEPING) Mr. Brett? (BEEPING) Dad? (BEEPING) (BEEPING INTENSIFYING) (BEEPING SLOWING DOWN) Whoa. Go north? Guys, guys, guys! Come on! I found something. (SHIVERING) (CREAKING) I'm going to be sick. I'm going to be sick. I'm going to be sick! - MAN: Hello? Hello? - (GASPING) - RAIGN: Come on! Come on! - What is it? Did you find something? Go north? The Big Dipper! Do you have the poem? Yeah. "Love hides in Heaven, not to be." Their love is hidden here because the Underground Railroad's codename for Canada was Heaven. The church wasn't just a place to escape, it was a safe place to hide. Right, people hid here. There has to be a hidden compartment or a room. Let's go! 'Kay. ♪ Guys, come on. I found something. What is it? Something important to confess? Yeah, I think you're an idiot. Okay. Cool. Sing five Cardi-B songs and you'll redeem yourself. BOTH: Guys! These pews were used to hide people coming across the border. That's it. There's a loose panel. Hulk. Help me. Okay, okay. (PANEL CLATTERING) Look, there's a book. But there's something else. The dust. It's been moved recently. HULK: What's it say? It's an old book of marriage records. A page has been ripped out. Someone beat us here. ♪
