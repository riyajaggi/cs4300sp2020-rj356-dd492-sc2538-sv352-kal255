 BOY: Man, it's cold. How did people stay warm in the olden days? KELLY: Heh! They didn't. I bet a lot of these people died of the flu. Did you know Spanish influenza killed somewhere between 40 and 70 million people in 1919? Bre Okay, Kelly. JOY: I feel perfectly fine. That's because you're wearing a dead bear. It can't be real, can it? I don't think they had synthetics back then.

 I'm wearing a dead bear? (RUSTLING) Guys! Wait! Over there is Margaret Powless. She died of consumption. Over here is Peter Deer. He died of sunstroke. Ha! Always wear sunscreen. I'm just going to freeze my head like Walt Disney. JOY: (TEETH CHATTERING) I think that's an urban myth. KELLY: Well, I do know that James Bedford, Ted Williams, and even his son John Henry Williams - are frozen. - I'm freezing! - What are we looking for? - A dog...

 or a wolf or something. We should be looking for Cockshutt's tomb. Actually... I think we should be looking for Hulk. Where'd he go? (SIGHING) I know where he is. He'll catch up. Let's just keep going. (SIGHING) Okay. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, Dad. I won't forget you, either. ♪ Whoa. Whoa. Wait. Hold on. My turn-of-the-century shoelace is untied. Hey, look. There's a bell attached to that gravestone. Maybe so they could call room service in the afterlife. Actually, those bells are connected to the inside of the tomb, in case someone was accidentally buried alive. Terrifying. HULK: Hey! Hey, guys. HULK: Hey, everyone! Do you hear that? HULK: Over here! It's Hulk. HULK: Over here! It's coming from over there. HULK: I found something! Guys! Guys... (SIGHING) (RINGING) Guys! Guys! What? Did you find something? I knew I'd seen this before. Look! JOY: It's the wolf symbol! ♪ Bre That's it. JOY: Ugh! Great. We don't have any tools to open the door with. We could ram it at the same time. Or buy bolt cutters. Where? Everything is closed. Bre Right. Remember, we're supposed to actually check the doors before freaking out. (ALL CHUCKLING) After you, fearless leader. No. Kelly, this is your adventure. We're just here for the ride. I can't do it. I'm afraid. So are we. We're all afraid of the unknown. Bre You know what makes me feel safe? That we're all here together. And we're going to look after each other, no matter what. Just like fear camp but with some friends helping out. And remember, it's okay to feel scared. ♪ (ALL YELPING) (ALL GROANING) - Ow. - Ow. (ALL GROANING) Is everyone okay? Why would you build an ice slide? Looks like someone forgot to salt the stairs. This place looks pretty big. - (SIGHING) - Looks like it was meant for a whole family, but only two tombs are occupied. Guys! Guys, come look at this. Huh. It looks like a weird handle. Or a keyhole... for a key! ♪ Huh. - It won't move. - Well, maybe it's stuck. Give me a second. Well, don't break it. Well, it's not working. It's the key. It's supposed to fit. Why isn't it working? WOMAN: Because it doesn't belong to you! (YELPING) Miss Dumont? - Well, it was kind of obvious. - Yeah. I did suspect... I figured it was her from the old church. She did have a weird appearance in detention. Quiet! I've been following the five of... Ah! (KIDS GASPING) Oh, my God! - Oh. - No. Yikes. - Are you okay? - Oh, yes. Thank you for helping me up. Why didn't the rest of you help me up? I'm your senior. Yes, but you did stalk us. Bre Yeah. It was some stranger danger there. Okay, fine. I can see how that would be... creepy. I've been following the four of you ever since you discovered the lab. And then Brett posted the treasure hunt on an Instagram. (JOY GROWLING) Okay, okay. I learned my lesson. But it wasn't until I saw that picture of the four of you in the Brantford newspaper. That was my proof. You had the map, and so I waited for the perfect moment to make my move. And then the prank. My prank. I had my eyes in the sky and ears on the ground give me the heads up. Ears on the ground? I paid a caretaker. They're very susceptible to bribes. Ugh! Caretaker Jay. You know, I knew he stared too much. Can you blame him? The support staff are severely underpaid. What do you expect with the current political climate? Okay. The play wasn't a coincidence? (LAUGHING) Oh, no. I could keep you close, and I had five heads to decipher the poems for me. And then you'd get to the clues before us. Ugh! Just like in the church! I feel so taken advantage of. - Oh. - Well, Kelly has the key, so the treasure must be for her. Obviously, she doesn't have the entire key. Oh, I finally get to make my own history. Wow. Nice nails. Oh, yeah. Thanks. DIY. Decals. Did it myself. ♪ (CLICKING) - (GASPING) - (GASPING) Whoa. (BEETHOVEN'S "SYMPHONY NO. 9" PLAYING) Wow. ♪ Hmm? (MUSIC STILL PLAYING) Would you stop that? Oh. Sorry. (TURNING OFF MUSIC) I thought it would add to the moment. Heh. HULK: From Die Hard, right? I watched it this summer. Yeah, you did, buddy. Yeah, you did. Hmm. ♪ What's inside? Treasure? Rats? Ignatius's bones? ♪ What is it? ♪ It's for you. ♪ "Respect for those who earn respect." Question what's taught to clearly see. Truth is hidden in plainest sight. The fortune you seek: The truth about family. "Signed E. Pauline Johnson." ♪ It's a birth certificate. JOY: Look. William Cockshutt and Aisling O'Failan had a son named... Alfred Cockshutt. RAIGN: Except Cockshutt is crossed out and replaced with... Darnall. But... that's my name. Is that... Are they my family? HULK: Ignatius must have renamed his illegitimate grandson to Darnall to separate him from the Cockshutt family. You are the treasure. And you two are related. ♪ So... there's no money? OMG, Brett. Timing. (BREATHING WITH DIFFICULTY) I have family left. And I have a history. But is this the history that you want? (BREATHING WITH DIFFICULTY) I was so concerned with protecting whatever was left of my family name that I turned a blind eye to the terrible things my ancestors did. Isn't all history kind of dark? But we remember it. So we can learn from it. And never repeat it. Well, except the Raptors. They can repeat it. (HULK CHUCKLING) Hey. On the bright side, now, you're rich. (WHEEZING) Oh, um, no. That is absolutely not the case. No. The family fortune was spent out years ago. I... I've been living in my office. - I wondered where that ball... - Weird clothes. - You closed the door... - You know what? - That makes sense. - ...So quickly when I... (GASPING FOR AIR) (GASPING IN SHOCK) Oh! Whoa! Are you okay? Miss Dumont. Your hands! The mold. (BREATHING WITH DIFFICULTY) I'm allergic. She's having an anaphylactic reaction. Do you have an EpiPen? Yeah. - It's cracked! - No. It must have broken when she fell down the stairs. Kelly, where's your EpiPen? Kelly? - KELLY: I'm going to be sick. - JOY: Kelly? RAIGN: Oh, no. Not you, too, Kelly. I'm going to be sick. Bre She's not having an allergic reaction. She's having a panic attack! Oh, Kelly, snap out of it! We need you! I'm going to be sick. - Where is your EpiPen? - I'm going to be sick. She left it outside! KELLY: I'm going to be sick. - I got it. - KELLY: I'm going to be sick. I'm going to be sick. I'm going to be sick. - I'm going to be sick. - RAIGN: Kelly, it's okay! - You're going to be okay! - I'm going to be sick. - (GASPS) - RAIGN: It's okay to be scared. Look at me. Kelly? Bre I can't reach it. (GRUNTING) RAIGN: Kelly? We're stuck. (MISS DUMONT GASPING) - KELLY: I'm going to be sick. - RAIGN: It's okay. JOY: Again. ♪
