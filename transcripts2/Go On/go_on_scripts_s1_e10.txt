 If you've been hurt, how soon is too soon to get back in the game? Grant Hill sprained his ankle and was on the dl for 46 years. Daffy Duck takes a shotgun blast to the face, spins his beak around and bam, he's back. A player wants to play. He can only watch from the sidelines for so long. What have you done with her? You're not supposed to be here. That's better. Carrie, I'm ready to put myself back on the market.

 I'm down to my sexiest weight, my tan is strong, my gift for saucy banter has come back. I have never seen you single before. Yeah, it's gonna be bad. I'm bad at it. Look, I don't know if I'm ready, but I'm definitely lonely. So I'm gonna take some shots even if I make some terrible mistakes. What about you? Should we hook up? I don't really feel like being a terrible mistake. Yeah, I read you. Gotta get the word out though. Let's update my Facebook page. Okay, change it, Carrie.

 To what, single, widowed, it's complicated? We're going right at it. Widowed. - That seems a little... - Intense? Yeah. You're right, that's why we're gonna cut against it with the following profile picture. Grab your camera. Ready? No. Bad, no! No, it's awesome. Take it. Okay. Now put in "likes Porsches" in a way that makes it very clear that I have one. And, thumbs-up a band. I wanna say mumford & sons, but that doesn't limit me to smart chicks, does it? Okay, this is not how you meet people. I forgot. I'm beating all the men around here off with a stick. Moment of truth, Carrie. Send it. New life begun. Crazy, Porsche-driving widower is the bait. Let's see who we reel in. You poor man. I had no idea. The kid is back. Go On 1x10 Back, Back, Back... It's Gone!  Original Air Date on November 27, 2012 Do you think it's too soon for me to date? No such thing. And rarely has anyone ever made a mistake while doing this. I'm sorry. This is a safe space. Admittedly, I'm flailing, but it's scary. I don't know if I can handle it. I mean, Anne freaked out when she tried it. Of course, I'm not as crazy as she is. No, you're not. She's glaring at me, isn't she? Yes. Say, what does Anne look like? I picture an angry Audrey Hepburn. That's close. Well, we'll find out if I'm ready soon enough. Olympic champion and Facebook friend Misty may-treanor invited me to play beach volleyball at their facility... So I will be mingling with some of the most beautiful people on the face of the planet. No. Can I come? Well played. Thank you. Well, make sure you're both available for George's party. Did everyone get the e-vite? Yeah. I'm not sure I understood the nature of the gathering. It's an "I'm not dead" party. Yeah, I understood the nature of the gathering. A year ago, some foolish doctors predicted that a man with all of George's diseases had only a year to live. That year ends tomorrow. I showed 'em. Well, it's not tomorrow yet. Let's hold hold off on the victory lap, sweetie. "Where's the group cat?" Asked the cat lover to the woman who was supposed to be watching it. Why you yell? What is it? "Pick on sexy lady" day? Cat is fine. Really? Is the cat fine? Or is it un gato perdido? That's no group cat. Sure looks like Puddin'. There's a phone number. Soy Fausta. Soy Fausta. - Soy Fausta. - Sonia? You're being a little intense, but, Fausta, at some point, we do have to address your narcissism. Yes, I lose the cat. We have no time to lose. Puddin's not built for the streets. Our central search area will be a triangle around Fausta's house. Then we'll fan out in a "J" formation to the southwest and the East, establishing checkpoints to the North. And then we'll split into groups and keep radiating from the center. Radiating from the center. Sonia, your plan bears a resemblance to... - What? - No, it's a good plan. Okay, Carrie, these girls are a little bit younger than I am. What do I do? Do I talk about Twilight? Do we still exchange numbers? Do we text? Do we talk through the cloud? What are you so worried about? You talk for a living. Yeah, well, if I wanted to attract weed-addled 35-year-old guys who still live in their parents' basement, then I'd have my pick. It may be where I end up, but it's certainly not where I wanna start. Hey, Ryan. Welcome. Hey, Misty, good to see you. Hey, be honest. Should I go with the wrap-around sunglasses? You're a volleyball player. Who are you falling for? This guy? Or this guy? Definitely no sunglasses. Because you wanna see my piercing blue eyes. Sure. I was right. That was the reason. - She said, "sure." - That's right. Boy, look at 'em. They're so tall and perfect. They're like the next stage in human evolution, and we're like the weird monkey creatures that come between actual monkeys and them. They're intimidating as a group, but you just need to attract one. Maybe she's been drinking because her father abandoned her at an early age. Well, one can only hope, right? - Yeah. - Hey. - Just need one! - Hey, ladies, ladies, gather. We have a visitor today. His name's Ryan. Hello, volleyballers. I really dig you guys setting me up li... And Ryan has a throat problem, won't be able to speak that much today. Okay, let's do this. - That's you. - Mine! - Okay. - Get it. Nice. - Yeah. - That was pretty sweet? I should tweet that out to the cloud. It's not gonna be her. You know, while we have a minute here, I'll... I'll bet your blood tastes amazing. You know, 'cause of the whole vampire thing. Twilight. Twilight. Carrie, I don't think she's drunk. I got it. Go, go. Hit it! My back! I can't move. Is he kidding? I'm not sure. It's not funny. But neither is anything else he said. Hey. Has anyone seen my wedding ring? Damn it. Carrie. It's okay, Ryan. I found it, I found it. It's all right. Hey, could we give him some space? Yes, leave us grotesque monkey people alone. I don't wanna be doing all this, Carrie. I wanna be married. I know. Put some sunblock on me, and go get help. Hi, I'm Ryan. This is how I am now. Come on in. Have a seat. George, we're so excited. We brought you snacks for your party. Jell-o, some yummy cookies. Great. This is bourbon. We all gonna take a shot and tear it up! - Well... - This is our itinerary. Okay. Jazz club. Yeah. Whiskey bar. Vegas... and Mexico. Okay, these two are illegal. This you can't get without a prescription. And is this a woman you've drawn? Well, that's roughly the shape I'm interested in. Excuse us a moment. Mmhmm. This list is crazy. Frankly, even if it just said, "walk up a flight of stairs," I wouldn't let him do it. Can we discuss a more important issue? Puddin' is out there alone. I'm talking about a man's life. I'm talking about a cat's life! I don't know how to argue with that. How are we gonna tell George he can't party the way he wants? He's a very proud man. We can do some of these things. This drawing looks very much like me. Look, we'll have one drink, he'll get sleepy, we'll call it a night. - Okay. - Okay. Feeling tired, George? Tired of waiting for this party to start. Is anyone even making out? What happened to you? I threw my back out with the beach volleyball girls. Beach volleyball. Hey, put that on the list. Look at this. Discotheque? Roller derby? What's this picture of Fausta? It's George's plan for the evening. Enough talk. Let's hit it. George, we're not going. Right? It doesn't sound so safe, man. You calling me old? Well, age is just a number, but yours is pretty high and it's not like they just call this place a "folks home." You think you're tougher than me? Hey! - Old man fight! - I'm not old. Twilight! Twilight the movie! - Old man fight! - George, no, no. Everybody, everybody, please. George, please settle down. I'm fine. Excuse me. I have plans. George. - Buddy. - No. Don't follow me! And you, sir, - need to return to your room. - Come on! You were right to pick me to help you for Puddin'. Search and rescue was part of my training. I wanted you more because of your bland personality and your willingness to take orders. Sir, yes, sir. This is his kind of tree. Let's see if he's up there. I'm gonna speak cat. You probably think I'm weird. No. I think you're awesome. Rock 'n' roll. So these are the women you played volleyball with. I know. I thought I blew it, but I got six emails this morning. They all want me. They found out I was a widower, and then all of a sudden, I was irresistible and vulnerable. It's the Sleepless in Seattle effect. - Is that a thing? - Yeah. The first time I went golfing after Patty died, women were throwing themselves at me. It was like I was the lesbian Fonzie. Gaaaay! Women are so great. The more damaged you are, the more they wanna heal you. We don't deserve 'em, King. No, we don't. Boy, I have been compared to Tom Hanks my entire life, and now this. I'm sorry, who compared you to Tom Hanks? People. The people of America. I don't see a mermaid giving up the sea for you. I'm sorry, it's just that I've seen Sleepless in Seattle, like, 40 times and you are no Sam. Okay, I'm getting worried. Has anyone heard from George? You mean other than the ten times a day he calls me by mistake. - He pocket dials you too? - Yeah. Yeah, I got this at 7:00 pm. - These peanuts free? - Also from last night. Yeah, you too! Another whiskey. She found it. Thought she was dead! Then she woke up and stabbed herself. Okay, okay, why are we obsessing over George? What about the cat? Thank you, Danny. This group, it's all about the people. It's like, "where's George?" "Which woman does Ryan wanna take into an alleyway and get all..." You just get it, dude. So are we gonna go look for Puddin' again today? Can't wait. I'll bring my compass, my canteen and... Do you think we'll need my gun? Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it. You know, I'm a little envious of you, out there dating again. Don't say that with Wyatt right out there. Wyatt and I are great. Hey, honey. - Hi. - Ready to go? Great. - Hi. - Mwah. Ryan King. What happened to you? Back in the dating game. Yeah, no, I saw the update on Facebook. Big swing, bro. Let me see your back. What? No, no, no. What are you doing? What are you doing? Should I tell him I'm a chiropractor? No, no, no, put me down, you monster! I love you. Don't ever leave me. Now that should hold you for a day or two and then you can come back and see me, if you're ready to enter into a healing relationship. "A healing relationship"? I mean, there's a real spiritual component to my work. You know, energy, chakras, crap like that. If you're open, great. If you're gonna be a bitch about it, you can go sit in your own load. Namaste. I love you. This date is gonna be great, Carrie. I'm wearing a suit that Cloons wore to the Ocean's 13 premiere. That was recent. Plus, we're going to one of my favorite restaurants, where the Italian maitre d' is gonna chat me up, make me look like a big shot. It's all very bene. Well, good luck. Mr. King, it's been too long. Hey, man. Will Janie be meeting you today? There it goes. Grazie. Sorry to bother you. Your feet look nice. Did I come at a bad time? No, no, no. I was just going out. But, my God. Are you okay? - I can't move on. - Aw. I can't even move. I'm hopeless. You're not hopeless. Great things are gonna happen. You're right there. Yeah? Yeah, you're gonna meet a woman who you feel comfortable with and who appreciates you for how smart and funny and attractive you are. Just for the record, that person is not you? - No. - Okay. - What the hell was that? - It was bad. - We can both agree it was bad. - Yeah. - What's bad, buddy? - Wyatt? How long have you been here? - A little while. - Like how little? You here for an adjustment? Let's get you an adjustment. Boy. You're really getting good at that. Thanks. I practiced all night. - And this morning. - Yeah. And this afternoon. You know, it's possible being on military disability has sapped my ambition. You know what, that looks like a Puddin' tree. I'm gonna go check it out. You keep it up. Okay. Hey! Hey! I find him in my oven. If I don't microwave everything, he dead. That's... That's great, I guess. What's wrong, my tall and stupid? I was just having so much fun looking for him with Sonia. Hey, so you think you could wait to tell her? She and I were really starting to connect. What am I saying? I'm married. Sweetie, come here. Your wife is bad woman. She does not deserve you. You take the cat. When you're ready, you be hero. Better, you hold on cat. Danny and Sonia search. When I ready, I take cat, be hero. Sorry, when I get around you, it's hard not to speak Fausta. I'd really like to get to the bottom of how long you were standing out there. Long enough to see a man in pain. Face down. Did you like seeing me in pain? Did it feel like... Justice? Does this hurt? Yes! Doesn't seem to stop you from doing it though. So you chiropractors, do you have to take an oath to heal and, you know, not kill? I'm not much of an oath guy. Mahatma! Mila Kunis! Are you a religious man? I'm sensing a lot of stress here, Ryan. You got something on your mind? No. What is it? Nothing. Flip over. Come on, what's bugging you? - No, just normal worry stuff. - Tell Wyatt. - You know you want to. - School. It's eating at you. Garbage floating on the oce... Yes, I did it! I tried to kiss Lauren! My God. That's fantastic. You tried to kiss Lauren? You son of a bitch! I'm just messing with you. I don't care. What? Why not? Why aren't you threatened by me? I'm like Tom Hanks. You're a lot like Tom Hanks. Thank you. Why aren't you mad at me? Come here. He told me, hon. Guess we got another one. "Another one"? They all fall for my baby. It's classic Florence Nightingale stuff. First it was the weight watchers crowd... Those cute chubbies... And now it's the Saddies. Wyatt, please don't call them that. Not in front of the Saddy? I got it. But you cheaped out. You were supposed to bring her something. They all do. Coffee table, that was from a Chubby. That lamp, Danny. That vase that looks like boobies. - Don't say Anne. - It was Anne. And now the great Ryan King joins the ranks. You two need to talk. But no making out. Grr. I will have to kick your ass because I'm so jealous. Well, I hope you're happy. - You almost got me killed. - What? - You invite me over here. - You showed up at my doorstep. You get all tarted up. - These are khakis. - You give me compliments. You say I'm smart and funny and attractive. You were sad. I didn't know what to say. - You're a grief counselor! - Anyone can do that. It takes, like, three classes. And everyone falls for you, so on top of everything else, I'm a cliche? Look, the good news about being a cliche is that you're like most people, and most people get better. Ryan, you're getting better. And for what it's worth, it was flattering. Yeah? So you'd say I'm the cutest of the chubbies and saddies? Goodbye, Ryan. George. Hey, George. No, I'm glad you're okay. He wants me to pick him up. Good tell him you were here and that the painting he did for me is still up. - Where is it? - Not up. He's a sweet man, but it's what you'd think. Thanks, Ryan. Now where you gonna tell people you picked me up? Las Vegas, Nevada, sir. Right. Not holed-up in some motel downtown. I was at a Bellagio Blackjack table, up ten large, surrounded by leggy showgirls, - and big muckity-mucks. - Got it. I used to be able to go out and tear it up. Live while you can, Ryan. Goes by just like that. - That's very wise, George. - No, it's not. When you get old, everyone thinks you're wise. I'm not wise. I just talk slow. I'm sorry, George, I was inspired by that. Listen, if it's all right with you, I'm gonna ask you for some advice anyway, 'cause I could certainly use some. I'm not ready to be with a woman, but I'm tired of being without one. I've tried everything I can think of. I stood up a 23-year-old volleyball goddess. I even tried to kiss Lauren. Slow down, son. I'm gonna tell you a little secret. People think life is short. Nah, life is long. The next right thing will come to you. Let it. Just be ready. Okay, that was wise. Yeah, it was pretty wise. - Thanks, man. - You're welcome. Ryan, before you go, I want a picture of us for the end of my night. Okay. Ready? There we go. There are some other pictures on here. Is this what you did? Barely half of what was on my list. Don't get old, Ryan. Don't get old. Hey, loverboy. Heard you tried to plant one on Lauren. George! I'm a gossip. These people have no lives. It's a volatile cocktail. So what's next for you two lovebirds? Are you going up to inspiration point to neck? Yes, you get to make those jokes because you never tried to win Lauren's love with an erotic vase. How did you find out about that? I am so embarrassed. This is worse than being felt up by boys in junior high. No, no, no. This gets spread wide. You gave her a painting of nothing. You made repeated invitations to your parents' place in napa. And you knitted her a sexy sweater with large arm holes. I like very much side boob. Falling in love with someone just because they take care of you. You cats, are so lame! Look what I found! Puddin'. You're perfect man. What's happening?
