 . .. Turn that off, would you, Bobby? Do you smell that clean air? I just smell manure. Oh, it's different up here. Good things happen when you get out of the city. I get shot every time I leave New York. That's an exaggeration. Degas run in Cap-Ferrat? Shot. Gauguin ceramics in Marquesas? Shot.

 That time in Jackson Hole with the wife? Also shot. - But Jackson Hole was our biggest score. - Still counts. Hmm. I never noticed that pattern before. Bobby, pull over. I think my mind is playing tricks. I know you ain't superstitious like me, boss, but I find this very serendipitous. Maybe fate's tellin' you you need a partner. This job is gonna be a real doozy. Get her as far away from here as possible. I don't care if you have to drive her to Atlantis. Keep her away from that s?ance. I'd need a boat to take her to Atlantis, boss. Hi, Ollie. - What are you doing here? - I was about to ask you the same thing.

 Oh, you know me, always poppin' up in the wrong place. You know you need a ticket, right? The Neverdies don't just let anyone in. Wanna go together? Sounds good. It's good to see you, Ollie. And it's disturbing to see you. Hey! Hey! Damn it, Ollie. Presto chango. Look. It's happening again. A fraction from one and nine creating persistent inadvertent harmonies. Inverse self-reflections are present. Present in both. That's fascinating. Every time I separate them, they just find their way back together. They're sticking. - It's reminiscent of iteration 41. - It has to be hardware. We should examine the IO spindle. Yeah, there... and there. Just a little scoring. Maybe something inside the F housing. But it's impossible to tell while we're still running. Do you want to order a full reset? No, my mother was too conservative when it came to these anomalies. Well, then, we'll push through. I'll try to manage it manually. Data tank between one and nine, yes. Uncomfortable, but manageable. I'll pulsadrate nine out early to unravel any globular weaving. Just do your best to uncouple them. I'll do the repairs right before we run the evens. Yes, sir. Azumi... We've shared intimacies. You don't have to call me sir. Ticket, please. Lady Neverdine welcomes you to the Full Moon S?ance, Sir Hightower. May I take your coat, sir? I have never been... After the s?ance, well, I know things have changed. - Will Arlie Kane be here? - Is that Ollie Hightower? - He is lonesome. - Is he as big a Cervantes fan as we are? - ...don't see it, I'm sorry.... - Oh, stop being so obvious. - Lady Neberdine lets us tour the house. - Not tonight. - Oh, bother. - Hey, go back to Hightower... Do you know what they thought owls meant in the old days, Ollie? Hello, Olivia. They're the moon incarnate. They lead us someplace safe. Every time. This s?ance brought out all the usual suspects, didn't it? I only see one. And I'm hoping he'll take me under his wing. Show me the ropes. Not tonight, kid. I work alone. You always gonna fly solo, Ollie? He said, "There's no such thing as magic, of course." So I made him a bet. I bet that I would do a trick and he couldn't figure it out. And if I lost, I would give up magic forever. - And if you won? - He would give me his peerage. You see, I wanted his "sir". And I got it. - How? - Tell us! I performed a trick. Oh, come on. And he was unable to crack it, and now I am Sir Ollie. - You can imagine... - You can't give away a title like that. - Well, sure you can. - But what was the trick, Ollie? - Come on, show it to us. - Yes. I'll demonstrate on our fair butler here. Good sir, may I have a moment of your time? I need to prepare for the great illumination. Oh, come here. It's just one minute. Just right here, come on. All right, you name a card and it will appear on the very top of this deck. - Any card? - Any card. Nine of hearts. Nine of hearts. Presto chango! Wow. Fantastic. - Amazing. - If you'll excuse me. You've done just fine, and if you'll excuse me one moment. You know that peach is bad news, Ollie. Oh, no. She's just my wife. What does that mean? Sudden change and destruction will lead to your liberation. For his own sake, Bobby better be lying dead in a ditch somewhere. He's not. How'd you trick him into bringing you back, huh? I didn't. It's just very hard to say no to me. Why don't we just lay our cards... on the table? What's that? You have to pay up for a bad joke. You are here to steal the lost 53rd chapter of Don Quixote. Just like me and half these lunatics at this s?ance. I don't know what you're talking about. Attention, fellow Neverdies, and those who are with us. Do you feel something in the room? Do feel something vibrating among us? Fuck. Component C protocol hasn't been triggered. Right now. It hasn't. Why the fuck is Gertie actively participating? What's the problem? She's put herself in. Who? Tonight is a special night. May I present... the first Neverdie. Gertie Neberdine. A true goddess of Luna. Oh! - I can't believe it! - All hail the Queen. - Oh! I cn't believe it. - Come on, I'll introduce you. There are some things I haven't told you. Things I... I wasn't fully aware of before I brought you back. I think... we have a serious problem. I think our computer is... horribly depressed. And might be behaving unpredictably. We're both great admirers. Yes, I sensed it. Arlie Kane, I know all about you. I heard you two were separated. We were. No longer. Hon, let me get you a drink. Excuse me. Oh! This is Robert. Hello. What's wrong with him? It's so hard to keep those we've lost in our lives. Don't you agree? You must excuse me. All right. Okay. Gotcha! Any lost chapters? You and your zapping around. Why do you keep trying to ditch me, Ollie? Because you are on my continent. No more jokes, Arlie. Go back to Paris. I'm working. - You still drink gimlets? - You still poison 'em? I only poisoned the one. What should we cheers to? How about the night my wife stole everything I have, slipped me a Mickey, disappeared, and I woke up with the cops and three years in the clink. I heard you pled guilty to that Sister Wendy job. Yeah, I have to quit doing that. So what happened to this dame that betrayed you? Rumor has it she ran off with another woman. Sounds like she might have had some sort of condition. She did. She always disappeared just when you needed her the most. To mistakes, then. You hear what I heard? - About what the lost chapter can do? - No, and I don't care. 1615, Cervantes writes the final chapter to his masterpiece. So powerful... that anyone who reads it is lost in their own fantasies... forever. He shows it to a friend, who slips into a coma. Same with a neighbor, never comes out. They live in their own dream worlds until they die. - Sounds swell. - Cervantes thought the opposite. He said being lost like that was a fate worse than death. For someone who didn't come here for the lost chapter, you seem to have thought a lot about the lost chapter. Don't be dense, Ollie. I'm not here for some score. But wouldn't you know? The lost chapter is hidden somewhere in this mansion. I'm here to help you. Goodbye, Arlie. You don't know where it is, do you? 'Cause I do. It's through a mirror. Who gave you that information? Some wise old crone in an alleyway in Barcelona. What does it matter to you? Because you lie constantly, that's why. So what was your plan, then, Ollie? To snoop from room to room until you happened upon it next September? Hah. Even if you knew where it was, she'd have it in a safe, and you can't crack a safe without me. Well, I'm here to help you. So for old times' sake, Mr. Magic Fingers, how about I do intel and you crack the safe? We can't help but do what we've always done. Do I have a choice in the matter? No. 9:05, time for the main event. Do not make me regret trusting you. I'll never betray you again. Then wait for my signal. Oh, joyous Celestial Goddess, now is the time for your energy to flow through us and pour life back into our lady's beloved. Tonight we speak to Juno, tonight we speak to Diana and tonight her life brings life to us. Lunar goddess? Who will be tonight's astral nodes? Oh. Them, I think. Those two. Us? - What the hell are we supposed to do? - The moon will tell you. We have reached... maximum illumination. They're playing our song. Stop trying to stick yourselves together! Oh, she's gone to the astral plane. Oh, it's working! It's working! Who wants to join her? Another dancer. You. Now. Wait, wait. ...with a title that you trade away! Because I'm their father, and you're their mother! God damn it! I have no idea where you are! - Is Mom coming back? - ...that again. Is that about the size of it? Um... tell me the whole story again. You don't get to give that up, Rosie. - No! - Once upon a time... - there were two girls. - It's not a fucking title... They rode through the forest on a wolf. A wolf, yeah. They were going to their grandmother's house. But they didn't read the sign. So, they got lost and couldn't really find their way home, until they read one of the signs. It said, "Don't go this way." - Good evening, fellas. - Evening. You didn't wait for my signal. Good gravy! Help me down. Come on. Look down here. The mirror's right there. Try this. Locked. Nothing here. You're not supposed to be here. There's another way, come on. Owen. Owen. I mean, Sir... Sir Ollie. So, I talked to a ritual cognitive. Turns out Jed and I were twins in the womb. Except he strangled me with the umbilical cord. Don't worry about that. That was... ectoplasm. Go back to your quest. Ah, Gertie's nuts. I'm gonna stick around here a little bit. Matches. What is this? The old crone said the spirit would take me exactly where I wanted to be. I don't know where to go from here. Do you know what they thought owls meant in the old days? Come here. Finally. Something that makes sense. How long is this gonna take? This place gives me the willies. Hey, Arlie. Seeing we're both inside a mirror and all... Do you ever think your condition... is a lot simpler than you think? Maybe you're the one with the broken heart, not me, pretending I'm the one who's devastated. It's the way that you make yourself feel stronger. Make me feel smaller. Sure. And maybe you like being the martyr a little too much. And you thought that "sir" would fix you, but it hasn't fixed anything at all. I guess we'll never know. Why is it so tiny? People were a lot smaller back then. All right. We should skeddadle. Sorry, Ollie. I'm gonna need you to hand that tiny chapter to me. I just really, really need it. Sure. You didn't have to use the gun. I would have just given it to you. That's always been your problem. That's not my problem. My problem is I let you get too close. And you're poison. There she is. Subject nine, your experience with the B pill is complete. Where's Ollie? What you're about to experience is the proximity test. It's a cross-check of the data that we've gleaned. Helps the G.R.T.A. render your reflections for the final pill. I'm a friend. And... this is normal. By the way, I was sorry to hear about your sister being crushed, and then burned to death... in that car accident. So... Your score goes up or down depending on the consistency between your answers and, uh... what we've observed. The scale is from zero to ten. Uh, anything below a 9.2 results in the termination of your experience at the trial due to, uh... a lack of progress. A lack of progress with what? The dissolution of your defense mechanisms. Okay. Consider this just me verifying that your data is usable. All you have to do is give an honest account of your experience. So, let's start by saying your name for a baseline. Annie Landsberg. And, uh... are you survived by any other relatives? Just my dad, Hank Landsberg. Your mother's deceased? I don't know. Huh. Do you know where you are right now? I'm in a pharma trial. Considering you've been abusing the A pill for some time, I'd like you to tell me about your experiences with the B pill. I had what felt like a hundred dreams all on top of each other. I call them reflections. Neurochemically, they're very similar, but so is psychosis. How many experiences do you think you had? I remember two well. But there were more. And more underneath those. It's a globular cluster of arborized realities. Well, they were realities that mattered more than mine. Describe your reality. Uh, my reality... is that I am depressed. And I have been for a very long time. Let's try and focus on your reflections. In one, I was Linda from Long Island. I could smell her perm. She was a nurse and a... mother, and a wife, which is... the opposite of anything I've ever wanted. And... then... I was Arlie. She was a thief and a con artist. A con artist is a liar. Why are you a liar? She... I think people lie because they're afraid, and she was afraid and she didn't want anyone to see that. Did anyone? Owen. He did. He saw me. He saw... her. Them. Subject one? Describe his presence. We were connected in all of them. With Linda... it was the kind of connection where you meet in seventh grade, and then... you look up and 20 years later, he's still there... holding your hand while you have a baby. You remembered whole lives together? Yes. Did the pill do that? It wasn't designed to. Why do you think you experience so many of these, uh, lives... with him? He said there was a pattern. And that we were connected to each other somehow. I... I mean, I thought he was crazy. So, I told him there is no pattern. There's just chaos. Let me ask it... in a different way. Why do you think you found yourself trying to deliver a lemur? Mr. Milgrim's presence notwithstanding. The woman in that dream was Paula Nazlund, the mother of the person that killed my sister. My real sister, in this life. And sometimes I fantasize about if Greg Nazlund had never been born. And when you were a thief... how do you explain that reflection? I had a goal. I needed to get something. And it... didn't seem to matter who I hurt. - Is that a behavior you share in life? - No. Is that a behavior you've seen exhibited in a parental figure? Is this therapy now? I thought this was supposed to be better than that. It's not therapy. Did you enter this trial in lieu of harming yourself? No! Why did the number not change? That's true. Were you suicidal? Arlie is like my mother. She could charm anyone, she would make deals with people. She would say things to me like, "This is just between you and me, Annie. You're the only one who understands." That's how she would get you. And then she knew that you gave a shit, and so your guard was down and she would gut you. Okay? How's that? It disturbs you, this idea of... behaving in the same way that your mother behaves. Yes. Did you and your sister make any of these special... deals? Similar to the ones that you and your mother had made? No. Ours were different. How? Ours was a pact. I took care of her when we were little. And she took care of me when we grew up. Here's your diagnostic. Someone will be through shortly to collect you. What's your report? Your security leaves something to be desired. Expect a bill first thing. It doesn't work, you know. The chapter. I already tried. Every mistake I've ever made started with "It's too good to be true." So, what do you say, Ollie? About a partnership? I told you where the safe was. That's gotta be worth somethin', right? Took me a minute. Thanks for that. But I don't do partners. What would you have wished for... if that chapter had worked? I keep my fantasies to myself. Well, maybe I'll see you again sometime soon. Bobby, you've got some explaining to do. You want me to turn it off? No, no, you can leave it, Bobby. I'm really sorry, boss. She shot me. She shot you, Bobby? Only in the shoulder. I've been trying to motivate myself to get in there. I haven't been able to move. She really wanted to come to the party. Did you and her reconnect, at least? No, it didn't work out. She had too much else on her mind. Hm. Aren't you gonna miss her, boss? You know what, Bobby? Life is simple as hell until you bring on a partner. Welcome back, subjects. Welcome back. ...
