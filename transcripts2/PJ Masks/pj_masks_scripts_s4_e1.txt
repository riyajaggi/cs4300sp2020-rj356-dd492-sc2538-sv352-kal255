 Gee, gotta work on those rhymes! It's Luna that's gotta work on stuff. Like learning that crime doesn't pay. (Laughs) Whaddaya mean, just tea cups? I'm having a moon tea party. They're perfect. Let's hit the road! Tea-party boogaloo! (Laughter) Party's over, Luna! But I was just getting started! And my surprise guest is here. Whoa! (Chuckles) - Aaah! - (Giggles) - Uh-oh! Whoa! Aaah! - (Giggles) Gekko! Hey! (Whistles) Tea party is a go! Too bad you're not invited, Bird Brain. Ha, ha, ha! Guys, you take Motsuki and the moths. I've got Luna. I'll show her! Ha! How about I be the teacher tonight? Lesson one, basic flying skills. (Laughter) Huh? Woohoo! Yeah! Aaah! (Laughter) This ends now, Luna Girl! See ya next lesson, Feathers. I'm off to the... moon! Whoa! Owlette! Maybe we... call it a night? - No way! - Huh? Ha, ha! That clumsy bird won't be bothering us any more tonight. Uh-oh! Shall we? Eeep! Aaah! That's what I call a tea party! (Giggles) - Wow! Cool flying! - Oh, there's more. You've stopped us spinning into outer space. What could make you fly better than that? Teaching Luna a lesson. And getting those teacups back, of course. Catboy, take the controls and go distract Luna! I'll swoop in from behind. (Gasps) Tsk, tsk, PJ Masks. This is my party. Little sis, charge me up! (Laughter) Do they really think I'd invite a mangy cat, a loopy lizard and a... (Gasps) Surprise! Ha! Hey! - Tea is served! - Why, thank you! How's that for a flying move? Grr! I prefer this one. The Turkey Twirl. Whoa! Owlette! (Groans) At least we got the teacups? Come on! Let's get that tea set back where it belongs. Teacups, schmeecups. That was fun! We go to fortress? Party games? Sure thing, little sis. What? Aaah! (Alarm rings) (Giggles) Woohoo! (Laughter) (Gasps) (Groans) (Laughter) - Hi, Amaya! - Hiya! Hi, guys. - Great job last night. - You were, like, vroom. And they were, like, "Oh, no!" And you were, like, swoosh. - And Luna was "Why me?" - But we didn't get back at her. She's just so mean to me sometimes. Luna's not bad all the time. When's she's good, she's pretty good. And when she's bad, she's awful. Come on. You have to rise above it. That's what being a hero is about. (School bell rings) (Blows whistle) Yay! Come on! Wow! - Come on, Amaya! - Oh, sorry, Meg. - Something wrong? - It's nothing. Just... someone's not being so nice to me. Who? Neve? Lucy? Caden? - Clementine? - No! They're all nice. They're in our class. This girl doesn't even go to our school. - Does she live nearby? - Not exactly. Yay! Play with us. We'll have fun. Catch! (Laughter) Amaya's sure got the Luna Blues. Huh? You know, when we do the thing we do at night, and we meet a certain person, who likes the Moon... Still don't know what you're talking about. But I think Amaya's pretty upset with Luna. Yup. That's for sure. We need a break. A few nights with no Moon, no magnet, no fortress, no... Strange bubbles delivered by moths? What's that? (Gasp) Help! PJ Masks! - I need your... Moon attack... - Sounds like she needs help. Not just her! The Moon's under attack! Come on. It's what we do. Go into the night and... Save the day, no matter what. Not even Luna's gonna stop me doing that. PJ Masks, we're on our way... Into the night to save the day! NARRATOR: Night in the city! And a brave band of heroes is ready to face fiendish villains, to stop them messing with your day! Amaya becomes... Owlette! Yeah! Greg becomes... Gekko! Yeah! Connor becomes... Catboy! The PJ Masks! About time, PJs. Motsuki and Luna need help. Eeep! Mwa-ha-ha! Romeo's robots are blasting all over trying to get in. What do they want? To get our crystals! - I made a forcefield! - But they keep zapping it! We need your help! That does sound bad. Imagine what Romeo could do with moon crystals. - (Alarm goes off) - (Gasp) By my cat's whiskers! Romeo's flown his factory almost into space. He must be controlling his Moon attack from there. We've got to stop him. Hang in there, Luna! To the Owl Glider! Robette! Another wave of Flybots to the Moon. And boost the radio transmitters. My Flybot Army is nothing if they don't receive my genius instructions. - Master. - Robot status report. We are attacking the Luna Fortress. But the Moon Girl shoots rays at us. They are ouchy. Try harder! My computers are examining the Luna wand forcefield. Soon I will discover its weakest spot. The PJ Masks! Change of plan, Robot. I want you here. Yes, M... aster. We need those crystals. Remember what we're going to do when I get them? Our victory dance? No! Well, yes. But only after I've carried out my awesomely evil plan. Get rid of them! Now! Whatever you say, Master. I want those crystals. Every single one. Romeo's sending instructions with those transmitters. Look! There they are! Fizzling with bad Romeo plans. Not for long. Let's get them, team. Too many! Lead them away in the glider. I'll fly solo. I should get close enough to use my Super Owl feathers. Oh! Yikes! Hey! Woah! Oof! LUNA: What's the hold up? Don't worry, Owlette's on it! Birdbrain? Now I'm really worried! If you... rise above it like a hero! Come on! We don't have much time! Just give her a chance. Uh-uh, I'm not letting her mess this up. (Dodging grunts) Keep the forcefield up. Now get me there. But then Motsuki alone! Eep! It's that or leave things to cuckoo girl. It's not really a choice. (Sigh) - Ha! - Argh! (Gasp) Fluttering feathers! (Colliding grunts) - Having trouble flying again? - CATBOY: Owlette! Let Luna do it. She's almost there. Only because she sent me spinning! (Gasp!) (Colliding grunts) Oof! Oh that's great! I'll get it next time. Oh no, I'm taking it from here. No, I am. I am! Weak spot discovered! Get ready for good news, Flybots! I said, leave it to me! (Gasp!) Huh? Eep! Eep? (Gasp) (Sulking reaction) (Leaping grunts) My crystal. Motsuki get to Luna quick! No! My fortress! Motsuki! No, no, no! Mwa ha ha ha ha! Oh! - Eep! - Ugh! And now, Motsuki? What else are you gonna mess up? Don't blame me! You should've... Flybots everywhere. Let's get out of here! Well played, my bots. Go Team Romeo. Hit it. I told you! No victory dancing until my plan is all done. Ooh. So pretty. Bad is beautiful, my robot friend. What is that? That, my metal-headed minion, is the whole enchilada... The end of the PJ Masks! Mwa ha ha ha ha! - What were you doing up there? - Me? You kept getting in my way. Motsuki's a teeny little moth again! - This is your fault. - It's nobody's fault. - It was Rome... - My fault? ...eo. I had a clear shot until you stuck your big head in. Who are you calling big head? Perhaps we should all go inside and have a glass of milk? ROBOT: Look up! Look up! No more arguing. We'll get the crystals back. Let's chase Romeo with everything we've got. Gekko, go for the canals. I'll take the street! Owlette, the sky is yours! Whoa! Furballs! Fly faster! If you want to make up for losing my crystals! You should be making up for stuff. Wait, where's it gone? Huh? - Where'd it go? - Weren't you watching, Owlette? - Mmm... - (Gasp!) Whoah! What is it, PJ Robot? It's Romeo! Huh? PJ Robot? Huh? Huh? Oh no! It's got HQ! One Flying Factory made invisible. Three PJ pests, totally confused. Is everything working, Master? Oh I think so, don't you? - (Dancing walla) - Ahem. Ahem. Just practicing. It's not time yet! (Dodging walla) (Sad groan) (Panic ai yai yai!) No one can stop me! Not now that we've got this! Bye bye, PJ Pests! Oh no! The PJ Crystal! It's got all our powers! Hey, my moon crystals are pretty good too. I know! He wanted them all! And now he's got them, who knows what he's going to do. Take the Glider! Eep. Well, I am an excellent pilot. I'll save you, PJ Crystal! And I'll stop Romeo! Huh? Did you see that? It's like it's... helping her. (Efforts) (Effort grunt) (Gasp) Waaaaaah! The PJ Crystal... Engine failure? We'll fix that! I have what we need. Moon power, PJ power, I'll take it all. Ready to be used in my most villainous plan ever. OK, keep it coming... Whaooao! Bad PJ crystal! Why can't you be like the good little moon crystals? I'll take your power, you'll see! (Sad whimpering) The PJ Crystal... ...gone. Your moon crystals, gone. I should've worked with you. I shouldn't have let you get to me. Eep? Eep? Eep? Yeah, that's what she said. Kinda strange, huh? It's not too late! I'll get all the crystals back! Catboy! Gekko! Don't let the Flying Factory out of your sight! OK, but what's the plan? I'll... We'll think of something! We're PJ Masks. Ha! By my cat's whiskers, what's happening to my Cat Car? It must be because of the crystal. Romeo's messing with it. Waaaah! No way! My Cat Car! We've been through everything together! What's going on? No! Luna, jump! Aaahhhhh! My Owl Glider! (Whistles) Whoah, I thought I had it bad. At least I've still got you mothies. Whaooaoao!!! Got to find Catboy and Gekko. It's not too late. (Efforts) (Efforts) If I can't take your power all at once, I'll take it bit by bit. Obey your Master! Ha! Whoa! Whoa! (Fainting sigh) (Groan) (Purr) Huh? I know, kitty. It's the middle of the night. What am I doing here? Hmm. (Bird call) This is a cat-tastrophe! What are we gonna do? And where's Owlette? Huh? Wait? She's calling it a night? Owlette! It's us! Owlette! Waaahh! Huh? Owlette? Who's that? (Alarm clock meows) (Suspenseful music) (Sighs) (Cat meows) Get any sleep? Not much. Romeo's got our crystal. And what about Owlette? Hi guys! Ready for math class? C'mon, I don't want to be late! Math class? But what about last night? Last night? It was pretty bad. Was it? You know... The attack on the moon? Then Romeo used his Flying Factory to steal the PJ Crystal. We must stop him before he does something terrible! It's all up to us, the PJ Masks! The PJ-who now? The PJ Masks! You guys crack me up. But we aren't joking. You must have some awesome dreams then. It's not dreams. We go out every night. I'm Catboy! I'm Gekko. And you're... I'm Amaya. (Bell rings) Time for class. Romeo must have done stuff to the crystal. It took her PJ powers. You don't think... It took her PJ memories, too? She's forgotten everything! We've got to make her remember. We can't face Romeo without her. (Bell rings) Yeah! Woohoo! (Laughter) Super Gekko Muscles! Super Cat Speed! Whoa! (Gasps) Hmph. That painting is awesome! Wow! - C'mon! - Yeah! (Laughing) Owl Wing Wind! (Gasps) Greg! You're ruining my art. Huh? (Nervous chuckle) (Sighs) Huh? Birds? Oof! What's gotten into them today? - Come on! - Let's go! Yeah! Come on! Woo! This isn't working. Maybe we have to stop trying to remind her and just stop Romeo instead. If we don't, he could drain our memories, too. We could end up not knowing we're PJ Masks at all! Huh? (Jingle) - Can you hear that? - Hear what? Hmm... Amaya? Hmm... What is it? I think I've seen it before, but... (Bell rings) It's just a stone. Meow! (Laughter) GREG: So, how do we face Romeo? With no vehicles, no HQ... But we've got my super-muscles and your cat speed. They still work! But no Owlette. So no PJ Team. (Sighs) What are we going to do? Luna! She'll want her moon crystals back! She's a villain, Greg! But at least there would be three of us. Don't forget Motsuki. It's Raspberry Ripple dessert day! I love Raspberry Ripple. Moon...? PJ Crystal...? Huh? Sorry, it's something Greg and Connor said. Gotta go! What's she done to her mashed potato? Oh! Someone's wrecked the best thing about the park. - Come on! - Yeah! Let's go! - Bye. - See you tonight, Amaya. - Huh? - (Bird whistling) (Gasps) Hmm... (Jingle) That sound again! Where's it coming from? (Gasps) I feel like I've seen you before. But where? GREG: So we go to HQ, check out the damage... And find PJ Robot. This feels so wrong without Owlette. We have to try. Maybe if we get the PJ Crystal back, Amaya will get her PJ memories back! Let's do it! PJ Masks, we're on our way... Into the night to save the day! (Jingling) Poor HQ. PJ Robot! Where are you? (Blubbering) (Excited reaction) Are you OK, little guy? (Panicking) I know, I know. Romeo's out there. Let's check the Picture Player. Oh... Romeo's working away in his totally enormous Flying Factory? And up against him, is me, and you, and... ROBOT: Owlette! Yeah, about Owlette... You are not going to like this. (Discouraged sigh) (Sleepy sigh) Luna... Crystal! Huh? CONNOR: Yay! The Rovers work. Nice job, PJ Robot. Can you do something else for us? If we're taking on a Flying Factory, we kind of need wings. ROBOT: But... Yeah, it won't be the same as Owlette. Don't worry, little guy. We got this. (Sigh of discouragement) LUNA: Help you? I don't think so. I lost all my moon crystals, my fortress collapsed, and my little sis' turned into a moth. (Squeal) Luna, we're sorry about last night. We really tried. Birdbrain's the one who messed up. Where is she, anyway? Long story... She's not coming. Figures. OK, let's do this. But I'm in charge. (Squeals) And Motsuki's second in charge. Not first, second. Second! AHH! WHOA! Uh oh. (Gasp) Flybot attack! AHH! (Squeals) Motsuki! (Squealing) Come on! Safety first. (Squeals) Meow! Huh? What's happening, kitty-cat? Meow! (Bird whistling) (Suspenseful music) The engine repairs are nearly done. And the PJ Masks are nowhere to be seen. Soon, the crystal power will be mine. Why did you stop working? This is my most genius plan ever! You should be happy. Work! Perhaps Master should tell them what he will do with the power. Not a bad idea. Can I hear again? Plans are groovy! It is so exciting. (Evil robotic laugh) (Squeals) Ahh! Look out! Super Cat Jump! Come on! WHOA! (Yelling) WHOA! Super Gekko Muscles! Quick, we need those wings, now! Ta-da! Yeah! We've got this! Lizard Lift-off! Super Cat Flap! Whoa! Ugh... This was never going to work. (Beeps) Good to go! Motsuki! GREG: We've got to keep trying! We can't let Romeo keep those crystals. All that power... Who knows what he's going to do with it? I think Motsuki does. She does? (Squeals) The Moon Crystals... (Squeals) Your PJ Crystal... (Squeals) He's draining them all... Nearly... Then, he's going to use that power to... - To... - What? What's he going to do? Well, you know he's got a super-powerful Flying Factory that can take over the world, right? He's making a bunch of them! (Gasps) Ha, ha, ha! Now I really will rule the world! (Evil laughter) Have the PJ Masks been captured? Whoa! Oof! Whaa! (Nervous giggle) LUNA: Ha ha ha! - Come on! - I can't shake them! - Luna, they're behind you! - Watch out! - Catboy, Gekko, look out! - Help! Where are you taking me? What do you want? (Jingle) What are they? (Gasp) What are they doing to me? - They're behind you! - Help! Gekko, duck! Catboy...? Gekko...? Luna! I... I remember! Everything! We've got to stop Romeo! But how? We're surrounded! It's no good! There's too many... Huh? Amaya? I'm Owlette! I'm a PJ Mask! Stay back! You'll get zapped! Into the night to save the day! Owl Wing Wind! ALL: Whoa! Oh, no! (Nervous laughter) And she's back! Yeah! Go, Owlette! Yeah! What just happened? What are those things? I think they're from the PJ Crystal. They wanted me to remember! We're sorry we gave up on you. You were always a PJ Mask deep down. It's OK. Last night, I forgot what being a PJ Mask is really about. Doing what's right. Helping whoever needs help. Including you, Luna. Me? You too, Motsuki. (Surprised squeak) I'll stand by your side whenever you need it. Promise. Even if I'm kind of mean to you sometimes? I should never have let that get in the way. Hmm... BOTH: Yeah! Well, if we've finished with all the mushy stuff, why don't we... get Romeo! ALL: Woo-hoo! Yeah! Okay. We need a plan. (Gasps) They're calling to me again. (Magical tinkling) Huh? Huh? (Bleep) Yeah! (Epic music playing) Wow, it's a... Gekko Mobile! Super cool! A brand new Cat Car! Amazing! What do I get? A seat next to me, partner. Time to be a hero! ALL: Yeah! The repair work is complete. Engines repaired. Time to go up, up, up, right into space! There I'll make my factories, one by one. Taking over the world... At last! (Groans) Good news is my PJ memory's back. My powers, not so much. Super Owl Feathers... (Groans) And I can't fly. I'm feeling a little woozy myself. Me too. Romeo must be close to draining our powers. So there's no time to waste. Time to be heroes! Yeah! Let's do this! (Screeching tires) Super Cat Speed! And Cat-A-Pult! (Engine vrooming) Wow, this new Cat Car is awesome! (Robots bleeping) (Screeching tires) (Laughing) Loving the lizard action! We'll keep the Flybots busy, Owlette. Over to you. Ready? (Worried squeaking) What? Ha! Oh, hello. Or should I say bye-bye? (Clang) - Whoa! - (Crash) (Gasps) The PJ Crystal! - Let me get you out of here. - LUNA: Help! - (Luna screaming) - (Motsuki squealing) Whoa! Ohh-ohh! Luna! Can't... hold on... long! I'm coming, Luna! Agh! Whoa! (Screaming) What are you doing? But your powers... (Fizzling) What's happening? The Crystal! It's coming back to life. My powers! They're back too! Whoa! You saved me? It's what PJ Masks do, Luna. You took long enough! (Both giggle) (Whirring) We're almost in space! (Gasps) Quick! Before it's too late. Probably best if I fly... (Motsuki squeals) What? Something's happened. It's the PJ Crystal. It's back! (Groaning) (Gasps) Huh? Whoaaa! (Robots whirring) Aw, come on! Not this one too! What's going on? Whoa! It's the PJ Crystal Power. It's awesome! But how do we get our crystal back? Owlette? Catboy, take the controls. We're going to save our crystal. This time we're doing it together. (Giggles) Yeah! Woo-hoo! Those PJ pests think they can defeat my Flying Factory with a new Jet. How about lots of Flying Factories? (Bleeping) Factory-making starts in five seconds. Five! Owlette, can you hear me? Almost there. Four! Almost there. Three! Owlette! We're coming in fast! Two! How are you guys doing? (Bleeping) Almost done. One and a half! Are you going to be in place on time? Yup! Give me a minute! One! Ha-ha! Zero! Romeo wins! (Rumbling) What? No! (Alarm buzzing) Why are we losing power? GEKKO: Whoa! Stop that! I need to stay in space! BOTH: Woo-hoo! ALL: Yeah! - May I? - All yours, hero of the sky! We're all heroes of the sky. (Groaning) No! OWLETTE: Bye-bye, Flying Factory. (Yelling) (Screaming) Oh... (All cheering) (Robotic chanting) Is that a victory dance, Robot? Sorry. Robot has practiced so long. And these tiny factories are so nice. Gaaah! But I'm not nice, Robot! I'm bad! And I want to rule the world! And I will, PJ Masks! You'll see! Aww! (Robotic chanting) I'm back! Couldn't have done it without you. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! (Heroic music playing) Motsuki back! Little sis! (Laughter) ALL: Yeah! Thanks, PJs. Especially you, Owlette. You really do help everyone. Even a meanie like me. Aw, Luna. You're all right. I guess. Sometimes. When I feel like it. Yeah! (Affectionate bleep) You were super tonight, Luna. We all were. I think it's time to celebrate. Hit it, PJ Robot! (Happy bleeping) (Excited bleeping) A tea party? For me? For all of us. Regular teacups, not stolen museum ones. Hope you don't mind. It would've added a special something. But hey, this is pretty special too. Tea party boogaloo, everyone! (Motsuki squeaking) PJ Masks, all shout hooray! ALL: 'Cause in the night we saved the day!
