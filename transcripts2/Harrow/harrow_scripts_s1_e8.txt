 Previously on Harrow... If Quinn is dead, you know that Bryan will find the killer. That might not be Quinn. -Well, we're diving again. If we find that skull, it'll be a done deal. The Geneva Institute wants me. That says, "To Professor Maxine Pavich." Are you stealing both of their identities? Quinn's phone. We found a message on Quinn's phone from Steph Tolson. That's it, I warned you. Now when I find you, I'm gonna fucking kill you.

 Why are you here? What have you found? You know he always took care of that car. In the last ten months, has there been a claim made against it? I don't think we can tell Harrow about this. It's a conflict of interest. He was married to Quinn's wife. Quinn's car has come up. -How do you know? I'm staring at it. And when were you going to tell me about Quinn's car? Don't you trust me? Using my exam room without asking is one thing, but that album is a first pressing. And you're not rostered on until midday. Why are you here? I work here. You, however, have an office two flights up, remember?

 Do you know how long it's been since I've picked up tools? Seven years. You know, they say you never forget, they're right. This feels really good. Can you pass me that dish? And I'm guessing the Geneva job doesn't involve picking up tools. No, it's pure academia. But it's an internationally recognised institution, it's great pay and there's Swiss chocolate on tap, and I don't have to listen to you and Fairley fight like cats in a sack. Fairley's a bit more ferrety. My dysfunctional forensic family. You were prepared to walk away from us, from all of this. For my actual family. What about Nichols? Does he know you're thinking about Geneva? No. No, no, no. Don't you dare say anything. Pick up, come on. Shit. Hi, you've reached Maxine Pavich. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. Yeah, Max, hi. It's, Bryan. Um, just haven't heard from you in the last couple of days and wondering if everything's OK. So, can you just give us a buzz? I miss ya, sweetheart. Get back to work. Sarge? Quinn's car? -Yes. But look at the tyres. The ones on the left side are badly worn, at least a couple of years old. But both tyres on the right side... Well, they look brand-new. Well, usually two new tyres'd go on the front or the back, not on one side. OK, let's find out where Quinn got those tyres. Good work. I didn't hear you get up. What are you looking at? Sorry, I couldn't sleep. Ha, it's not too late to go back to bed. You want some tea? Sure. Listen, I was thinking about that camping trip. What camping trip? -Exactly. The one we never got to take. How about we head up to the coast on Friday and make a long weekend out of it? I'd love to, Jesse, but it's just... It's not a good time. What is it? Is it work? Is it Fern? Is it...? Is it me? No. I just... I just need to be at home right now, that's all. Is this for Robert? Yeah. No, I mean, I... I don't know, actually. Do you want to talk about it? -No. I'm fine. It's fine. OK. I'll probably skip tea and get a jump on the traffic. OK. I'll call ya. What are you doing in here? -What does it look like? But... But you haven't done an autopsy in... Seven years. I almost forgot how good she looked in scrubs. But you... I mean you can't... You're not supposed to be in here... What are you concerned about, Lyle? Are you worried that I might have a change of heart about Geneva? What? No, of course not. Are you? Deputy Coroner told me you rang him about my job. That's not very sporting of you, Lyle. I mean, why shouldn't I? I have just the right attributes for the position. Is backstabbing an attribute? You know, I really don't appreciate the pressure this puts me under, Lyle, and I certainly don't appreciate you going over my head. Until I make a decision... this job is still mine. If you'd like me to write you a letter of recommendation... Get out of my way. Should I ask? No. What are you doing here, anyway? I thought you were heading up the coast for Vivienne's birthday? His name is still David, and I am taking him to a resort for his 30th. We're leaving after lunch. Good. You can finish up here. Bye. Hey, it's me. Fancy getting out of the office? Hi. Hey. Early morning call for you. Sorry, I felt bad waking you up. I felt bad waking alone. Who's the boy? Rhys Weir, 17-year-old Alderly High School student and member of the rowing squad. His body was spotted early this morning by a rower. His backpack, clothes and phone were in his car up there. He had a key to let himself into the rowing shed to get his scull, which was found downstream. It appears he's driven himself here to take an early morning row, slipped and hit his head as he was trying to launch. Careful, there's algae. It's pretty slippery. A single massive fracture to the back of the skull. Consistent with a fall onto a hard edge? Looks like it. But? -Feel his face. Quite cold. I checked his temperature, ambient. He's been dead for at least five hours. So the time of death was... -2am or earlier. I know. Who goes rowing at 2 o'clock in the morning? All the senior rowers have a key to the shed, but they're not allowed access before 5am. Is there any reason he would have gone down there that early? Well, I suspect because of what happened yesterday, State Rowing Carnival. All the local state and private schools compete. We were defending the title for the eighth year in a row. Unfortunately, Rhys lost the single sculls event. Mistimed his stroke, and the school lost the title by six points. How did Rhys take it? Did you see his Instagram post from last night? He was gay? Yes, came out last year. But his schoolmates, and the faculty, have been nothing but supportive. Well, not everyone it seems. Who's Luke Chambers? One of Rhys's teammates from the quads. That's him on the far left. Luke's being eyed for a scholarship at the Institute. Very driven kid. I've no doubt yesterday's loss will put his scholarship in jeopardy. Eight years in a row and Rhys lost the trophy. He must have felt a bit of pressure. Not from the school. What about his family? You know it's just his father, right? Yeah, we contacted him in Dubai. He's returning on the next flight out. Rhys lived by himself most of the time, but he was very independent. Drove himself around. He was confident. Well liked. Feeling pretty low having ruined the school's eight-year winning streak. So do you think Rhys went to the river to try to... what?, redo the event he lost? At two o'clock in the morning? That's when the demons come, isn't it? You're kidding me. Is this you? Top of the class. I thought you went to a private school with Fairley? I did. Until I dropped out and came here. Long story. Significant impact trauma visible on the posterior of the head. Breach of the scalp and deep skin lacerations consistent with a fall onto a hard surface. Do we have the CT scan? Significant depressed fracture in the occipital and parietal bones. And there... Bone fragments. -Being driven into the brain tissue. Quick loss of consciousness and rapid death from an intracerebral haemorrhage. So this poor kid blames himself for losing the title, heads out in the early hours to prove to himself that he's not a loser... Slips on the boat ramp and dies. Being gay, do you think that added to the pressure? High school's hard enough without the added bonus of coming out to your friends. Do you want me to swab the wound? Do a full tox? Yes, then we'll turn the body. Healthy musculature, skin pallor consistent on legs, arms and abdomen. What does this look like to you? Scratches. A cold sore, maybe? Endocam. Thank you. Look at the swelling of his tongue and throat. His windpipe is almost completely blocked. Anaphylaxis? -Maybe. Let's do a histamine test and get a beta-tryptase count, and we'll open his stomach and see if we can find what triggered this. I don't get it. Going rowing at 2am is one thing, but who goes rowing while they're suffering anaphylaxis? Well, the school nurse is adamant Rhys had no allergies, at least none that he told the school about. But we know that he was exposed to something that triggered an allergic reaction, just before he slipped and fell. How long's it take for anaphylaxis to kick in? A severe attack? Minutes, seconds even, after exposure. So whatever the allergen was, he must have been exposed to it here. Was there any food or drink in his car? No. None in his backpack, either. Can we take a look in the shed? Do they keep any food or drink in here? Maybe in their lockers. No food. Water. Look at this. Leave who alone? -Rhys was gay. Maybe it was written by a jealous boyfriend or girlfriend? It doesn't help us solve the allergy. Did you find something? Rhys Weir's bloods have come back. His tryptase and histamine counts are through the roof. Anaphylaxis. What about his stomach contents? Any idea what the allergen could have been? There was no food in his stomach or lower intestine, he hadn't eaten all day. But I did find traces of undigested base proteins in his oesophagus. Such as? -I'm still running the tests. Hey, but get this, his blood alcohol level was 0.02. So he'd been drinking. Yeah, one or two it seems. OK, thanks. Think he was drinking alone? -Let's find out. We all came back to my place after the carnival. Me, Sean, Luke and Rhys. Why? Mostly to make Rhys feel better. He was feeling pretty sh... pretty low after the race. We thought we might cheer him up. What were you drinking? Answer the question please, Ash. A... a couple of beers. Vodka. Did Rhys ever have an allergic reaction to anything? What, like sneezing? Choking. Shortness of breath. What'd Rhys drink? -One or two vodkas, that's it. And he drove himself home? Yes. We... We were all too... We couldn't drive. When? Rhys left first. About one o'clock. OK... Did he say where he was going? No, we thought he was going home. How did he seem? -He seemed pretty happy to me. Luke, did you write this? Yeah, look, I was pretty upset, too. OK? It was a mistake. It was stupid. I shouldn't have done it. We also found this in Rhys's locker. Do you know who wrote it? None of us wrote it. Ash? Luke? It wasn't us. Do you know who it's referring to? Did Rhys have a boyfriend? Boyfriends? What about you guys? No. I have a girlfriend. We all have girlfriends. What's this got to do with how he died? Are we done? Yeah. Not quite the tight crew I expected. No. But it doesn't bring us any closer to knowing what triggered his anaphylaxis. I have to go and lodge some paperwork. Call me. Need a hand? Not from you. What was that about? -None of your business. You still angry about Rhys losing that race? Yeah... I am. I've worked really hard for this scholarship to the Institute. I can't repeat again. I'm sorry that Rhys is dead, but him losing that race means that I'm probably not going to get in. Psst, Harrow. Have you, um, spoken to Maxine since this morning about, you know, Geneva? No, but what you said has given me a chance to reflect, and I thought if the job's good enough for Fairley, perhaps I should give it a shot. What? No. No. Absolutely not. You are not management material. Says who? -Says me. You disregard protocols, you have nothing but contempt for your colleagues, your office is a mess, and do you even know what a razor looks like? I suggest that you leave this one alone, Harrow. If anyone's getting that head job, it's me. That's not what it sounded like. Again, should I ask? Again, no. Lab results are in. We found a mystery protein. Semen? Rhys had Seminal Plasma Hypersensitivity, he was allergic to semen. But not all semen, just the prostate antigens of one particular male. So he was giving oral sex... Moments later started choking. So if it happened that fast... The person he was with would still be around. Those semen traces you recovered, do you think there's viable DNA? If there is, I can get it. What are you going to do? Thanks for coming in. We'll let you know if we need anything further. Julian, Sean, come on through. Come on. Hi. We're asking all the boys who were with Rhys the night he died to provide a saliva swab for DNA testing. Why? Rhys had sexual contact with a male, just before he died. And you're suggesting that could have been my son? No... -My boy isn't gay. It's OK, Dad. I'm happy to do it. -No, you're not. That dead boy, Rhys, he was gay and everyone knew it. They also knew he lived alone, he was unsupervised, he had a car, he could have gone to a club, to a boyfriend's house, to God knows where. So why are you picking on my son and maligning his reputation... Maligning now? -I know how the world works. You start suggesting that he is anything like that, you start slandering him.... Someone's sexuality is slander? ...doors will close on him and I won't let that happen. Your son said he was happy to provide a sample. Well, I'm saying he's not. -OK. Well, we're left with no choice but to seek an order. Fine. Get it. See how you go. Sean. Robert Quinn. Did you know him? Doesn't ring a bell. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. Have another look. '99 blue Commodore. Sorry. No, see that's funny, Leo, because I have a receipt here for two tyres sold by you to Robert Quinn 11 months ago. Now, unless you want to be charged with obstruction of justice, I suggest you stop pulling my middle leg. Alright, take Mr Little down to headquarters. Wait, wait. OK. Yeah, I do remember Quinn and his blue Commodore. That you fitted two tyres to? Yeah. -On the same side of the car. Why? Someone hacked into the sidewall with a screwdriver. Hey. Don't go away, Leo. Nichols. A skull? When? Is it on its way to Turbot Street? But why should I do it? Because I am telling you to. But it's Harrow's case. He should identify the skull. You gave it to him. -And now I'm giving it to you. Fine. And do me a favour? Don't mention this to Harrow. Why? What's this about, Maxine? Oooh. Shit. Hey, you. Yeah, you. Who the hell are you? I've told you a thousand times, that it's Robert's debt, not mine. Soroya Dass. -Soroya, hi. It's Stephanie Tolson. I'm used to having debt collectors knock on the door at all hours, but these guys... Am I under surveillance? -What? I don't know. We still haven't identified the bones we found in the river as your husband, so... no. It's just I thought with his car coming up and it looking like... Like, er... Robert was murdered. Is there any reason the police might suspect you were involved? No. No. They probably were just debt collectors. I'm sorry. Want one? -Technically I'm still on duty. Tea? Sure. I'm sorry about the mess. I'm just sorting through stuff that I don't wear anymore. This is Robert Quinn's. Where did you get this? You said you didn't have any of his stuff. Steph, you need to tell Nichols about this. This is important. Why? Why would you not tell us that you had this? Because it's not your business. Shit. Why didn't you tell me you had her under surveillance? You don't put someone under surveillance without a good reason, Bryan. You've found something, haven't you? What is it? What? What's going on? Soroya, that's why we brought you in here, OK? We figured you need to know. Stephanie Tolson is now a person of interest in the disappearance of Robert Quinn. Steph? OK, Quinn's phone. We found it in his car and we've accessed his voicemails. Soroya, this stays in this room. -Yeah. This was left on Quinn's voicemail the day before his car went into the dam. Fucking arsehole. That's it. I warned you. Now when I find you, I'm gonna fucking kill you. Now Quinn was insured for half a mill. A payout like that would have covered her debts nicely. We've also discovered that two of Quinn's car tyres were slashed less than a week before the car went into the dam. Pretty angry gesture. Now we know you went and saw Steph. Did she say or do anything to make you think she was involved in Quinn's disappearance? Sergeant? She's got Quinn's wedding ring. It's in the house. I read the inscription. Well, thank you, Soroya. Wait. I know the skeleton we found had a ring finger cut, but we still don't know if the bones are Quinn's. Our divers found a skull in the river. Turbot Street has confirmed it's Robert Quinn. He was murdered. And Steph Tolson's looking pretty good for it. Not a good time. -Yeah, well, it's not great news. Good, I could use some cheering up. Julian Paulson's lawyer just rang. Let me guess, he's appealing our request for his son's DNA sample? Yeah, and it gets worse. Now all the boys are refusing to give samples. All of them? So we're going to have to take this all the way to the Supreme Court, which means it's going to be a few weeks before we can rule any of those rowing squad boys in or out. Shit. OK. Look, I've gotta go. -Daniel? Just don't do anything stupid, OK? Did you tell the other boys not to give their DNA? You shouldn't be here. Did you? -No. Then why have they changed their minds? Why have you changed yours? Is it your father? No. What's going on, Sean? Let go of the door. You don't need your father's permission to give a DNA sample. You can go to the police yourself. -Let go. I just want to find out what happened to Rhys. He hit his head, you said so yourself. Yes, but I know that someone else was with him when he died. And I wanna find out who that was. I thought he was your friend? He was. Then surely you'd want to know what happened? No. I don't. I don't want to know. Hi. Fern. Don't go. It's fine. Hi. I'm Soroya... -I know who you are. You're the cop that found Robert's car. Yeah. Hey, can I ask you something, Fern? Your Mum and Robert, were things OK between them, towards the end? What do you mean? Did they ever argue, or...? How bad did it get? I wasn't at home. I wouldn't know. Fern, do you know if...? Do you know if things ever got physical between them? You think my mum killed Robert. No, Fern. You don't have to go. Hello? You have to check in on Mum. The cops think she killed Robert. What? Why? What's going on? Fern. Where's Nichols? Is he inside? Is Nichols in there? I need to know what's going on. I'm sorry, Doctor. -My ex-wife is in there. Sir. -I want to see her. If you don't leave the property, we'll have no choice but to detain you. I don't think you should answer that. Soroya Dass told you, didn't she? -Why didn't you tell us? Because it's nobody's bloody business. Where did you get it, Steph? Where do you think? From Robert. -When? How? I mean, come on, Steph. We can do this down at the station if you want. I found it in my letterbox. OK. When? I don't remember. Did you see who put it there? No, but who else would have put it there? Can you give me a date? No, because I didn't diarise it, Bryan. Steph, where you on the 3rd of October last year? That was a Tuesday night. -Why? Just answer the question. -I don't remember. Did you ever damage the tyres on Robert's car? No. Did you ever have cause to threaten him? Christ, did I threaten him? Yeah, maybe. I don't know. I don't remember. Steph, you're gonna have to give me something. Why? Are you gonna arrest me for murder? You know what Robert put me through. You know what he was... Bryan, I did not slash his tyres. I did not steal his ring. I did not put him in the river. I did not kill him. Steph. What happened? Where are you? -At home. Why were the police searching your house? Think you should ask your girlfriend. Hey. What did you tell them? What? The cops raided Steph's house. She said it was on your recommendation. Daniel... -What did you tell them? She had Robert Quinn's wedding ring at her house. And what? That makes her a criminal? I thought you liked her. I do. I do like her. I think you'd better go. You OK? I'm fine. You don't look fine. Why are you here at work? You should be with David. I pushed through the DNA samples on the seminal fluid we found. And? You pulled an all-nighter to get these markers? I should have told you, all the boys have refused to give samples. Sorry. -You're kidding. Why the change of heart? I think Sean Paulson's father talked them out of it. Alright, so where do we go from here? Is this from Police Scientific? -Yeah. Yeah, there's nothing unusual on Rhys's clothes. It's just algae, dirt and saltwater from the river. What? Do we have the results of Rhys's head wound? Yeah. Here. There's no traces of algae in his skull tissue. Right, so... The ramp was covered in the stuff. It was all over his clothes, but none in his wound. Let's shave his head and get a cast made of the back of his skull. Watch your step. Algae. Is this where he hit his head? This is where the police think. Have you got the cast? -Yeah. This isn't the edge that fractured his skull. It doesn't match. Look. This isn't where he fell. So if he didn't hit his head here, then where? It's a match. What are you doing? You need to leave. Rhys was here the other night, wasn't he, after the party? You said he left early. But you did too, right? Then he drove you home. Was he your boyfriend? Or was it your first time? He gave you oral sex. And then Rhys began to choke. What's wrong? Rhys didn't hit his head on that boat ramp. It happened here, didn't it? The grass was wet yesterday, someone had washed away his blood. Look, you don't have to lie anymore. If it was an accident, it's not too late to admit it. So please, Sean, tell me. How did Rhys fall? Did he trip? Get back inside. And, you, get off my property or I'll call the police. I think you should. -Inside, Sean. Now. No. Get inside. No. You knew, didn't you? What's wrong? Hey, hey, hey, hey. Because you caught them together. Inside, Sean, now. -It's too late, Dad. They know. -They don't know anything. They need to. -Shut up. You're right. Dad caught us. He was so angry. You just pushed him. I told you to leave. He was dying and we could have saved him. We could have called an ambulance. But you made us stand there and just watch him die. He's lying. He... he's very upset. Then you made me go with you to the rowing shed. Sean, come on. -We dumped his body... Hurry up. Get in the backseat and get his feet. I wanted to tell you the other day, but you still wouldn't let the truth come out. Because it's not true. OK, that other boy was gay, but you're not. I am, Dad. -You're not. This is his fault. OK, I warned him to stay away from you. I told him not to go anywhere near you. You wrote that note. Hey. Hey, don't you touch him. Let him go. Shit. You had trouble at school, too, didn't you? Yeah. And you know what? I always thought a kid like Rhys would have had it easier than I did. But I guess the world hasn't changed as much as we'd like to think it has. Look, Julian deserved what he got today. But you don't want to turn out like me. No, I don't. But I'm not going to stop caring. I want you to take the night off. Take Gregory and drive up the coast with David. You're giving me the Fiat? -I'm loaning you the Fiat. Go on, quick, before I change my mind. Hey, you know, this is a really great incentive for me to get my manual licence. What? Wait. Simon. Steph. Steph. -Please don't touch me. Steph, look, I know that you're not very happy with me right now... but if there is anything that you're keeping from the police, anything at all, you have to tell them. Steph, they think you did it. They think you killed Robert. They're looking for anything to pin this on you and they're finding it. Look, if there's anything you're not telling us, now's the time. Steph, what can I do for you? You wanted to see me? Yeah. Take a seat. What night was this? 3rd of October last year. Same night Quinn's car was driven into the dam. Yeah. Steph admitted herself into hospital at 2pm that afternoon and wasn't discharged till later the following day. Did she say what she was in for? She said she fell down the stairs. Hospital confirmed a fractured rib. So she didn't drive Quinn's car into the dam. No. But that means we are back to square one. Steph has an alibi for the night Quinn went missing. Turns out she was in hospital. -For what? Fractured rib. She's no longer a suspect. I just thought you should know. What about the ring? The divers found a skull. It's Quinn's. That's you, who did that. You found his car. You found his phone. You forced them to dive more. That was all you. Sorry. Yep? Well... I just wanted to speak with Max about... No, I get it. Geneva? Your secret is safe with me. Right. Yeah. Tremendous. Why are we out here? Well, it's just a little bit more private. It's going to rain. What is so important? Geneva? Who told you? Was it Lyle? I'm going to throttle him. Why didn't you tell me, Max? Because I haven't made a decision yet. What, and you didn't think you should discuss it with me? Well, I just... I didn't... I didn't want to complicate things. Alright, well, that worked out well. So, what are you thinking? Are you gonna take it? I told you, I... I don't know. I... I don't want you to go. -Bryan... No, and I've been thinking... And this might seem a bit sudden, but I reckon we should get married. Married? Yeah. Why not? No, Max, I'm serious. I want you to be my wife. She's got her mother's looks. And her father's personality. Don't wish that on her. Is that your father? No, that's Jack Twine, the man who saved my life. I never told you how my father died, did I? I was 14 years old, an exceptional student at an exclusive private school. And one day I came home to find my father... had hung himself in the dining room. I didn't take it very well. I acted up at school, got kicked out. But the man that got me back on the straight and narrow was Jack. He was the pathologist that did my father's autopsy. And he took me under his wing, taught me everything I know, that whisky is for drinking, that rules are there to be skirted around, and that the dead deserve respect. Even my father, who I'd been angry at for a long time. So if it wasn't for Jack, I don't think I'd be here. So he knows all your deepest, darkest secrets. Every single one of them. What's in the fancy box? It's an antique surgeon's kit. A gift from Jack, from when I got my doctorate. But enough with the self-indulgent melancholy. More wine? -Yeah, sure. We're all out of wine. This commendation means a lot. But even though it's my name on the award, it isn't just for me. It's for all of us that have worked tirelessly to get ice off the streets. The trust I put in my team. The trust they put in me. That's the real reason that I'm up here today. Sarge. OK, September 27th. Yes, the night before Quinn bought those new tyres. Yes. You've enlarged it? Fern Harrow. Next on Harrow... We are compiling evidence for a charge of murder. She had some help. What do you want? I want to talk to Fern Harrow. Give her a call and ask her to meet you. You think he was involved? Harrow is capable of stupid things. Would he hurt someone? The cops found his skull in the river. Was it you? Do you know if anyone wanted to harm your father? In plain English, you miserable old Jew. I don't think she wants your help. You think he killed Wagner? A hate crime?
