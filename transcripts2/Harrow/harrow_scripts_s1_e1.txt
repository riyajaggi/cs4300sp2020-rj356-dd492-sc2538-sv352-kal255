 What are you doing? -Watching High Noon? No, no. No, no. Why aren't you working? I hate clowns. Yeah, lots of people hate clowns. You're being paid to complete an autopsy of one by 5pm. Let Fairley do it. -You're doing it. No, I'm not. -Daniel, the police need it by today. There are people of interest who are a flight risk, because, ta-da., this looks like murder. Great. -Not great. I need to know if it is. Give it to Fairley. -I gave it to you.

 I'm not doing it. Do you think I don't know who this guy is? Accusations of child molestation. But none that have stuck. Now that he's dead, the police are thinking one of his victims grew up, tracked him down, surprised him on his yoga mat and broke his neck. Then why aren't you doing the autopsy? Because if I do it, I'll find that cause of death is a subarachnoid haemorrhage on the base of the brain as a result of traumatic medial laceration of the right vertebral artery by excessive auto-rotation of the C2 and C3 vertebrae. He died twisting his neck doing yoga in his make-up. Wearing it because it brought back sweet memories of the tender moments

 he spent with all those children whose lives he destroyed, hence the angel lust. You want it done, give to Fairley. With a bit of luck, he might suggest blunt-force trauma, the police will investigate and then enough dirt will come up on this shithead that he'll be remembered as a child molester instead of a clown. You really shouldn't interrupt a guy watching High Noon. Fairley's finished your clown. Give me one good reason why I shouldn't fire you? Vocabulary. I have the most arcipluvian way with words. You quit years ago. -I know. It's hard to start again. They say it's easy but, I tell you, it takes willpower. Knock yourself out. You told Fairley about the yoga. Yes. He might have come to a different conclusion. Now that grease-painted prick gets away with it by dying. It was the truth. You know what? You should fire me, before I get us both into trouble. Yeah, I should. But what good would it do? You'd still be in that exam room, working. You love it too much. So, what happens the next time I find something that I don't like? You watch Gary Cooper and you tell the truth. But if you fail to do your job, I will dock your pay, so get back to work. And apologise to Fairley. Fairley? You're here to apologise? . Yeah. Because you want to or because Pavich told you to? Thanks to you, I'm late for my kodo class. Kodo. The Japanese art of incense appreciation. You were right. -Yeah. You OK? Yeah. Harrow. Has your daughter taken drugs before? Not that I'm aware of. What was it she took? First symptoms suggest some sort of psychoactive, like MDMA. But she's responded well. How did she get here? -She was left outside by someone. They didn't stick around. She's just in here. Fern?. Fern. Fern, wait. Not a great time. Sorry. Is Fern there? Ha. No. Has she called? -Using her actual voice? She sent me a text, like, a week ago, saying she's fine. Why? What's happened? She was admitted to Emergency. She took something. When? -A party drug. But she was OK. -Which hospital? Is she OK? Did you see her? She left before I got there. What do we do? -I don't know. Just let me know if you talk to her. Do you know who I am? Yeah. Bruce Reimers. Not sure why you're here? Get bored of hassling Fairley? Fairley's an idiot. He's not. Though he does spend more than a hundred bucks on a haircut. Drink? -Sure. Tough shit. I don't drink with people who break into Bettie. What do you want, Reimers? It's from your boss. If I don't collect Livvy's body by the end of the week, the state will cremate her. End of the week? Well, you better... -No. No. The case is closed. -Reopen it. Reimers, your daughter wasn't murdered. She was murdered. Olivia didn't kill herself. Your idiot mate, Fairley, got it wrong. Hey, I don't like Fairley any more than you. But he is thorough. -Well, he missed something. No. You gonna shoot me? Dead pathologists do shitty autopsies. Whoa. Not Bettie. Whoa... Livvy was murdered. Look, I'm sorry. You get what everyone else gets. You get the system. The system that looks at everything and makes a decision. And the system decided your daughter wasn't murdered. Hey. You, a part of the system, can change it. Just because you don't like the answers doesn't mean you get special privileges. Trust me, I know. You can threaten me, you can hit me, you can even shoot Bettie if you want, but I can't change the system. You say that. But you have a daughter, right? You get to see her again. I never will. Fern. You know you can get new shears from Bunnings for, like, $10. You don't get these at Bunnings. This is an 1870 surgeon's kit by Mathieu of Paris. How do you know? I read the box. Google it. OK, maybe you don't sell it to street traffic, but auction online, three grand, easy. Tell you what, 100 bucks. 900. 200. 600. 300. Five. -500. They're worth over three grand. 350. -Done. You're quick. -You were lazy. This is the closest pawn shop. Next time, I'll go further. Goodnight. You OK? -I'm fine. You were on a hospital drip two hours ago. What was it you took? Are you gonna take more? Not right at this second. -Your mother's worried sick. Yeah, I got that from the 500 voicemails she left this afternoon. Thanks for telling her. -Well, what do you expect? You disappear for the best part of a year? I keep in touch. -Text messages. "I'm alive, I'm fine." You think that's enough? -Has to be. You could have died today. It's my life. Bub, we need to talk. We really don't. There's something I have to tell you. I'm going now. -I'll follow you. You do that, and I swear, you won't see me for another year. What if I quit? You couldn't leave work for two days straight, let alone... But what if I did? What if I quit and me and you, we sail to Bora Bora. Very Brando. Pack fat clothes. I mean it. What, and you and me sit on the sand and play our guitars? Yeah. Why now? -You need me. I don't need anyone. Look, I should have tried harder, I should have quit sooner and I would have if I... Listen. There's a good westerly coming Friday. Enough time for me to get Bettie tidied up. Come with me. Friday. Just say it. Friday. Friday. Alright. What's this gonna cost me? Well, let's see. Kind of early for drinking, isn't it? Even for you. Do you remember our bet? That you'd outstay me in this job. Losers pay. I thought we talked about your crisis of conscience yesterday. Come on. You've said you're quitting hundreds of times. Yes, but I've never typed it. If this is about the pay scale, there is nothing I can do. It's not. -If you need counselling... It's Fern. You found her? -She was taken to hospital. She's OK, this time. Take some time off like you did last time when you were looking for her. I promised, we're going away. Your contract stipulates two weeks' notice. Then you'll have to sue me. I quit. So... it's true. Yes. It's true. I stole your penis. But you can have it back. You know, I'm going to like this office. Fairley, you already have an office. But I want this one. Aren't you gonna ask me why I quit? Nope. In that case... you can have your Yamazaki back too. Don't get gay germs all over Gregory. I thought real men gave their cars girl's names. You see, it's started already. Were you gonna tell me? You know Fairley wants me to assist him. Fairley already has an assistant. Fairley already has an office. I can't learn anything from him. Now, Simon, you know I've never expressed any interest in your sexual proclivity. You put shit on me 50 times a day, alright? Working with you, it's like competing in the Olympics of sexual harassment. OK, be that as it may, you have someone special. What's his name? Vivian? -David. We've invited you to our place a... dozen times. Don't worry about the work. You're not stupid. You'll learn what you need to. Worry about spending time with David. The living are more important than the dead. What are you doing here? I said I couldn't help while I was part of the system. Your daughter's place? You've been paying the rent? For the last 14 months. I had to sell my place. That's why I'm renting that shit box at Moorooka. You haven't been working? -I can't work. Who could work? Did you find her? We were going to have dinner. But she was late, so I came here. That's where she hit her head? -No. That's where her head was hit. But wasn't she...? -Drunk? Yes. 0.12 blood alcohol level and an overdose of Amitriptyline. But listen to me. She'd stopped drinking and she was off her antidepressants. Clearly, she wasn't. I'm telling you, she was. People can take pills and forget that they've taken them and then they take more. And those tricyclic antidepressants can cause cardiac arrhythmia. The pills didn't kill her. That did. Intra... -Intraparenchymal haematoma. Look, if he she slipped and hit her... She didn't slip. She'd stopped drinking. She was off her meds. This was no accident. You think it was her fiance? Kurt Callana wasn't even charged. He has no motive... -Bullshit. He killed her. He did it. And I can prove it. Here. "K-U." "Kurt." That's what she was trying to tell us. Fern? Are you OK? I'm fine. You were in hospital. Are you alright? What happened? Where are you staying? I've been so worried about you. So was your dad. He... We don't know where you are? We don't know if you're hurt or sick or... Sweetie, we're just trying to help, OK. Don't. OK? Why won't you talk to me? Where's my passport? _ Morning. Cindy. Hello. "Big... wanker." _ Is that Olivia Reimers? What did you find under her nails? Nothing. What are you doing? "Nothing", nothing, or nothing significant? "Nothing", nothing. You quit. -So, no tissue from Kurt Callana. You. Exam room two. You're still mine. So, how's retirement? -Awesome. Looks a lot like work, only with no pay. To the untrained eye. -You trained me. Yeah, well no-one's perfect. Look at her right lower jaw. Could that be a pressure contusion from say a thumb? Yeah. Or a tennis ball. Or a car door. -Shut up. Or bumping into a stranger in a supermarket aisle or slapping a mosquito. -Seriously, shut up. Pretty much anything, including hitting the ground after that happened. She's frozen. -I know. You won't find anything until she thaws. I know. -And that could take a few days. Is Pavich OK with you doing this? -She's totally cool. What the hell do you think you're doing? Forensic pathology. No, no, no, no, you've resigned. You said I could be here. -No, I said, "Clean out your office." You said no active cases. Olivia Reimers is not an active case. -Exactly. It's a closed case. Her body's being destroyed in three days. Yeah, probably, unless her father claims it. He doesn't want to claim her. Because he is bankrupt and he can't afford a funeral. Leave it alone, Daniel. It's not your business. Reimers thinks she was murdered. . You think I don't know that? I have a whole drawer devoted to his letters and the Department of Public Prosecution has even more. Fairley has a restraining order against him, as does the girl's fiance. Callana, yeah. -Who was never so much as charged. Look, Olivia Reimers is a diagnosed manic-depressive whose cause of death Fairley determined was brain injury. Fairley signed off on it. I signed off on Fairley and I am not reopening this case. I'm not asking you to. Well, what are you asking? -You're right. Olivia Reimers is a closed case, so her remains are no longer state's evidence. There are three days until Reimers claims her or the state cremates her. Let me have those three days. I have her father's permission to re-examine the body. I just need yours. Look, on Friday, I get to spend time with my daughter. Reimers will never get that again. He just wants to know we didn't miss anything. Just let me have those three days. Alright. Three days. But you don't get Simon. What does the silver stain show? Pneumocystis. -Which indicates? Fungal infection consistent with the compromised immune system of the deceased. Good. Write it up. Are you signed in as Fairley? -No, as me, why? I tried logging in as him, but I couldn't. Fairley changed his passwords. -So untrusting. What is his password? -I don't know. And even if I did know, you don't work here anymore. You've fallen in love with Fairley. -You know what? I assisted him for one morning and he's already complimented me on my work. You know how many times you did that? Twice. In one week? -In four years. So, come on, what is it? 'Stiff buster'? 'Path god'? 'Coldplay fan'? It's 'love n1nja' with a numeral 1 for the I. What are you looking for, anyway? The name of the cop who decided it wasn't homicide. Shit. Nichols. Looking sharp today, Nichols. Jesus Christ... Go away, Harrow. No need to ruin an already rotten day. I heard you were quitting. -I heard you did quit. Can I help you? Sergeant Saroya Dass, new scene of crime, she's just up from Melbourne. Dr Daniel Harrow. Prick. So, you're the SOCO? What happened? Someone tried to drown the foal of a prize racehorse. Stablehand heard movement down here, at the creek. He shouted out. The foal escaped. The perpetrator got spooked and ran away. Attempted equicide. I don't think it was a master criminal. The killer didn't even bring a bridle. It's a shit job, dead-end case, and I say we pack it up. But you don't agree? You can lead a horse to water, but... You can't make it drown? No bridle. So, if not a stick, then...? Carrots. -Or apples. Which they do keep in a fridge up there, where the horses are stabled. But? -Locked. The complainant has the only key. Has the foal eaten? Since rescue? No. So, we should check its teeth for carrots. Or apples. And if you find any...? Visit all the local convenience stores open before dawn and see if they sold any carrots. Or apples. That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Yeah, it's insane. Come on, Brian, let's give it a shot. What do you want, Harrow? The Olivia Reimers' case. For f... Bruce Reimers? Showed me the tile. "K-U." "Kurt." So what? Her last thoughts were of the man she was gonna marry. Harrow, Olivia Reimers was a medicated manic-depressive. There was no sign of forced entry. No motive. No sign of a struggle. And Kurt Callana had a solid alibi. See, that's why they call it a closed case. So, what would it take to reopen it? For you? A full confession from Kurt Callana. Mr Callana? I'm really sorry. Do I know you? Daniel Harrow. Hi. My goodness. What a beautiful engagement ring, and a beautiful girl. -Harrow? Yes, I work with the coroner's office. You are aware that the body of Olivia Reimers, former fiancee, is being cremated in two days' time. That is if no-one claims her. Her father's the executor of her will. I imagine he'll be claiming her. But you're not even contesting that. I mean, you were about to marry Olivia when she died. You loved her, right? So, why aren't you even attempting to claim her remains and, you know, see her off? Sue, why don't we head up? Awkward. It's not awkward. I did love her. I loved Olivia very much and when she took her own life, it broke my heart. And it took me a long time to put my life back together. And now I've found somebody I love and who I want to be with. Her father says you killed her. Bruce Reimers? Do you know why Olivia was on antidepressants? Have you read her police report? I trust we won't be bumping into each other again, Mr Harrow. Careful. That's a second pressing. I thought you'd gone home. And we all thought that you'd gone for good. What are you doing? You're breaking into my files. -I'm looking for her police report. So you can prove that I was wrong? That you're better than me? You're a good pathologist, Fairley. -But not as good as you. You're not better, you're lucky. You go dancing around, trying to find out what the victims did, what they thought, what they were like. You know what Olivia Reimers was like? Well, too bad, she's dead. You know the reason she died? There, massive haemorrhage. That's the cause, not the reason. I want to know why, yes. I want to know why she drank two cups of vodka when she wasn't drinking. I want to know why her stomach was full of Amitriptyline when she was off her meds. We are not in the 'why' business, Harrow. We're in the 'what happened' business. Sometimes you can't tell what happened unless you know why. That's the police's job. It's the court's job. It's not our job. Look, will you just show me her police report? You want to know why Olivia Reimers killed herself, do you? Right. There. Suicide note. Read the last bit. "I can't handle it anymore. "The memories of what my father did to me just won't go, "so I have to." She killed herself because of her father. There's your why. Log off when you're finished. Reimers? Harrow. Did you touch your own daughter? What?. Did you interfere with your daughter, Olivia? No. -I read her suicide note. You didn't think to mention that? Don't believe that note. I never touched her. Were you the reason she was on antidepressants? Yes, but, I... It's not... -Fuck you. If you're thinking of moving in, there's quite a few people in front of you, but I'm prepared to look at your references. Bora Bora? You spoke to her? She spoke to me. Eight words, "I'm fine." "Don't." "Where's my passport?" And "Bora Bora." Technically seven words. Bora Bora, which means... It's not a joke, Daniel. I know. And I have tried everything, everything, to reach out to her. And now, not only are you talking to her... -I tried too. ..you are taking her out of the country. I didn't plan it. I got her to stand still for four seconds, to listen. So, you expect me to believe that you quit? I did. Call work. So, Fern let you in? Not yet. But if I can talk to her, maybe we have a chance. Why is she like this? Other kids get through divorce. So, Bora Bora? Very Brando. Pack fat clothes. That's just what she said. Don't let her down, because if you do, I swear to God, I will put you on a slab myself. Smooth transition? That's what you said. I seriously don't have time for this, Lyle. What? And you think I do? You call this smooth? "A Fairley... small penis." Lovely. Finished already? Don't put her back into subzero. I know. She's scheduled for cremation tomorrow? No, no, her remains have been claimed. Reimers doesn't have two cents for a funeral. It wasn't Reimers who claimed her body. It was Kurt Callana. Callana? Why? Why now? Is this any of your business? But don't you think it's strange? For more than a year, he wants nothing to do with her. And, suddenly, when I go to see him and start asking about Olivia, he's...? You went to see him? There's something he doesn't want me to find. Daniel? Daniel, seal up her body and get it ready for collection. It's over. Belt. I just want to go up to CIV. Shirt. What? Take off your shirt. Yvonne, it's me. Daniel. I've been coming here for years. I went to your 40th. Shirt, sir. Or leave. I'm gonna have Yvonne fired. What the hell are you doing here? Why aren't you returning my calls? Jesus. What do you want, Harrow? Kurt Callana. You told me that he had a solid alibi? Yep. Well, what was it? When Olivia Reimers died, Kurt Callana was at the other side of town, at his mother's house. Can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for the neighbour of Sofia Callana. Yeah, well, I'm the neighbour, Walter Kingsbury. But if you're trying to sell something... No, no, no, I'm here about the prize. What prize? The Real Estate Agent of the Year prize. Kurt Callana is a finalist and those who nominated him are in line for their share of the $100,000. Look, I didn't nominate anybody. Well, we've been told that he's a stalwart of the community. A loving family man. Well, I wouldn't exactly say that. How often does he visit his mother? Was he here last Christmas? No, I didn't see him last Christmas? -How about Easter? Was he here at Easter? Walter, go home. Who are you? Another one of Bruce Reimers' snoops? I'm with the coroner. Kurt wasn't here last Easter, was he? Kurty didn't kill that poor girl. She killed herself. She was a mess, a screw-up. A burden. And who wants mental illness in the family, right? Kurt was better off without her. Do you have children, Mr... Harrow. Yes. Then you know you'd do anything to protect them. Come back with the police if you want. I'll say the same thing. So will Walter. Kurt was here last Easter. He was helping me with the roses. Those are purchase contracts for properties she bought. Why would she photograph her own signature, over and over? Because that's not her signature. I wonder... Look who she bought those properties from? Callana. They were his dud properties. He offloaded them to Olivia. Stuck her with his bad debt. So, she was taking photos of them as proof. Olivia? Olivia? Olivia?. So, he forged the suicide note. But when I came to see you and told you about the note, you admitted that you were the reason she was on antidepressants. working all hours. When Olivia came along, I didn't stop. I hired babysitters and tutors and... when she was older, I sent her to a private boarding school. But all she wanted was to be with me. And I said, "I'm not spending all this money so you can come home." I said no. And that's... when she started... But when she needed me, I said no. Is this enough? To go back to the cops? No. But it's enough for me to believe you. What's up, Dad? You answered. Did I wake you? It's nearly five in the morning. Of course not. What's wrong? Nothing. I... I was just bored and I... So, you called me? Yeah. Checking in? Yeah. I'm gonna go to sleep now. Hey... -What? On Bettie, you've still got that old DVD player, right? Yeah. OK. Have you been here all night? You're in early. I had a dream about you. You know, not only are you just not my type, you are not anybody's type. I was worried about you. You weren't answering your phone. -Shit. I mean, sorry. It's Fern, isn't it, why you resigned? It's all gonna be OK. What time are they coming for her? -First thing. Eight. Have you ever been depressed? No. Not even about being gay? No, no, no, I mean it. Some people have total arsehole parents that make it really hard to come out to. No, my parents were cool. Maybe it was that simple. Maybe that's why she drank and took too many pills. Here's the thing. She didn't. Sure, she had a lot of alcohol in her blood and a lot of pills in her stomach, but most of them were undigested. This central incisor is freshly chipped. How recently? Very. Fairley figured she chipped it when she hit her head. But it wasn't on the bathroom floor and it wasn't in the stomach contents. It could still be in her throat. Endocam. Something hard impacted there. Right. But look at that. Scratched. Well, she was in the bathroom. She knew she took too many pills. Maybe she changed her mind and tried to make herself vomit and scratched her throat with her own fingers. Except there was no tissue under her fingernails. Not even her own. So, where's the tooth chip? Maybe... His alibi is that he was pruning roses. But he wasn't. Where's he put her? We buy it together. It's in both of our names. I already have an apartment. We can sell it, we could rent it out. Why can't we live there? Because we need the equity in this other property. I don't need any more... ..water. Under-hydration is the most common cause of bowel upset. Lovely to see you again, Kurt. I'm sorry. Does that hurt? Call the cops. -Sure, but let me have a look. I am a doctor, after all. Never saved a patient yet. -Let me go. No, no, I insist. This won't hurt a bit. Aaagh. -It'll hurt a lot. Nerve ending. Call the police. Call the police. Call an ambulance, tell them they have a patient with a fresh fracture to his proximal phalange. That's gonna need an X-ray. Thank you, driver. See you next time. I always imagined the Bail Fairy to be taller. Can you imagine how unhappy she is? Did they X-ray Callana's hand? Yes. Did they find the tooth chip? Yes. Did you find Olivia's body? Eventually. But I didn't tell them that. You're gonna miss me. Detectives today took into custody 35-year-old real estate agent Kurt Callana after... I need that report. ...Mr Callana's former fiancee, 28-year-old Olivia Reimers, who, until recently, had been thought to have taken her own life. May I? My mooring fees are up to date, Officer. So, this is where you live? Yeah, not for long. I'm off to the tropics tomorrow. Yeah, I heard that. Hey, jump on. There's something I want to show you. You're gonna love this. You're gonna want to cancel your trip. A fisherman found something down there this afternoon. It's illegal to fish here. Yeah, well, I for one, am glad that he did. Are those... bones? Human bones. We've already sent a bunch of loose ones down to Turbot Street. Do you know what they're encased in? Concrete. Well, it's definitely not suicide. I knew you'd love it. Hey? Have you seen this? Adult male pulled from the river, set in concrete. Yeah, Saroya told me. Saroya? Skull? -Not yet, apparently. They're gonna keep diving. Have a look at this. A finger. Severed. By a propeller? -I don't know. It looks mechanically cut, to me. I mean, scissors, secateurs. And look at these ridges. Shouldn't you be packing or something? Fern... I'm sorry. I have to stay. Fuck you, Dad. Next on Harrow... Do you have any clue who this guy was? None, whatsoever. Plus, there was a finger bone deliberately severed. Body's come up. Do you think anything's gone? Like what? -Like a heart. I'm sorry. How could you let her down like that? I don't think I'm gonna want to talk to you for a while. I envy you. How you hunt. You'll... never... know.
