 Previously on Harrow... Looks like he drowned. He boarded a ferry last night. He never got off. Simon turns up to the bar, asks for Moran, and within 90 minutes, they're both dead. I stand by my autopsy and I'm not reopening Simon's body on some crazy hunch. I know what Simon found. A link between Brendan Skene and Francis Chester. They shared a cell together. The handwriting is identical.

 I'm convinced he killed Simon and Moran. Simon died because he was burning the candle at both ends. Why?! Because he was trying to be like you! Simon's dead and I think it's my fault. There is no conspiracy. Dad thinks he's wrong but... I don't. Harrow... Harrow! Do you know what time it is? Yes. Pack a bag. I'm sending you west. Where? Euralla Creek. Where?!

 100 miles south of Cunnamulla. Google it. There's only one flight in and out every day, hence the early wake-up call. Can't someone else go? I've got a stack of PMs to do here. Well, Grace and I will take care of that. You know how I feel about the outback. It'll do you good to get away for a couple of days. And don't worry - you're not going alone. Ah. It's beautiful country, isn't it? Yes, if you're partial to dust, flies and duelling banjos. I suggest you choose your clever remarks more carefully around here. Or what - I'll be lynched by the locals? Fingers crossed. I still don't get why Maxine had to send two pathologists to an MVA. I'm sure she had her reasons. Wasn't the local sergeant going to pick us up? Maxine said he'd be here. I'll give him a call. Oh, great! No signal. So, how DO we get to town...? You coming or not? Cute. Lyle Fairley? Judy. Don. I thought it was you. Welcome home! It's been too long. Yes. Fancy seeing him! You're FROM here? I grew up here. Well, why didn't you say so? You didn't ask. They love you! What's wrong with them? Hello, Doctor. Hello, Sergeant. That's all you got for your little brother? Come here! Come on! Bring it in! Bring it in! You're his brother? Senior Sergeant Colin Fairley. You must be Dr Harrow. Lyle's told me all about you. Don't believe a word of it. He said you'd say that. So, how's our niece, uh, settling in? Well, it's early days but she's doing well. She's doing amazingly. I'm not surprised, being in such good hands. Mostly. And, uh, Maxine said there was a death on the team? Yes. Shall we take a look? Before we do, there's something you should know. Bob and Diane? It's tragic. You knew them? Everyone knew them. They ran the local bakery. We think they were heading in to work when their vehicle was struck. Diane was killed on impact, but we found Bob on the road, unconscious. He was thrown from the vehicle. No airbags. They weren't even wearing seatbelts. Is that unusual out here? It is for Bob and Diane. Will Bob pull through? Uh, they're operating on him now. He's in a really bad way. Tell me about the sedan. The driver was a 26-year-old male. Ethan Chambers. He died on impact. A long way from home. Adelaide. We ran a background check. He's got a charge list as long as your arm - assault, theft, sale and possession of stolen goods. Including cigarettes? Yeah. There's a booming trade for cheap ciggies in the mining towns. He did very well too. Uh, we've found three grand in cash so far. How did this happen? It's not a busy stretch of road. And, yet, they ran straight into each other. We also found this. He'd been drinking? Looks like it. Sarge? One of the boys has found something. What is it? Dr Harrow? Fingertip. Look at him! He hasn't changed a bit! Still as handsome as ever! Oh... Beverly, please, you're being silly. Oh, don't be so modest, Lyle. You've always cut a fine figure. Who's this? Daniel Harrow. He's also up from Brisbane. And you're assisting Dr Fairley? Assisting? No. I'm also a pathologist. Really? So lovely to have you back where you belong. We've had a soft spot for Lyle ever since he locummed here. Broke our hearts when he had to leave so suddenly. Now, you I don't know. I don't know you either. Edwina Gharam. This is Lyle Fairley! And... Daniel Harrow. Eddie's volunteered to assist with the autopsy. She's got some surgical experience. So, you live here and you've never heard of the famous Lyle Fairley? Should I have? I like you already. Smell that? Rum. He reeks of the stuff. Mm-hm. Ooh, nasty. Substantial clavicle and trapezius contusions. Seatbelt? Mm-hm. Ooh... Severe whiplash. The fingers on Mrs Shepard's left hand are intact. Same with her right. Fairley? Uh, some superficial skin abrasions but no missing nails or fingers. Mm. Then it must be Bob's. Can you confirm he's missing a finger? Uh, he's still in surgery but I'll go and check. Ooh, this is interesting. Parallel abrasions on the forearm. Given the pattern, I'd say they were fingernail scratches. From the crash? No. These look several days old. Daniel's taken his laptop with him but you can use his desktop. You should be able to print out your CV from there. There you go. Mm-hm. And, uh, if you need a referee who's slightly more reliable than your dad, I'm all yours. Thanks, Maxine. It's really good to see you, Fern. ♪ Who'll mend this broke beat star? ♪ Whose strength do I speak of? ♪ Climbing, deep burning ♪ Climbing deeper ♪ Climbing, deep burning ♪ Whose words that I spoke now storm ♪ I keep it turning ♪ It's climbing, deep burning... ♪ Substantial impact trauma. Fractured sternum, several ribs. One of the ribs has punctured the right lung. Liver and spleen ruptured. Torn aorta causing severe and torrential internal haemorrhaging. You OK? You don't have to stay. Oh, no, I want to. Usually, when people die, it's the end of the story. Not the start. Shall I put some music on? Great. Must we? I'm sorry, Fairley. You're outvoted on this one. What would you prefer? Some snappy show tune? I would prefer something resembling music. ♪ For your rock'n'roll... ♪ This sounds like... ...a baby seal being clubbed. Why are you so snippy today? I thought you'd be pleased to be back home. Just... keep it down. ♪ You'll get a lot more kicks... ♪ What's that scar on her abdomen? ♪ With a little bit of soul... ♪ Did she have a C-section? No, she's had a hysterectomy. Quite some time back, by the looks. Really? I never knew that. Oh, so, there are some secrets in the country. Bob Shepard's just come out of surgery. He's not missing a fingertip. Then whose finger is it? Could there have been a fourth person in the crash? We didn't find any evidence of it. Well, apart from the fingertip. Assuming it came from a living person. Look at the skin, where it's been severed. Swollen, inflamed. Cell damage. That's exactly what happens to tissue when exposed to extreme cold. What, you think it's been frozen? Looks that way. What are you suggesting, Harrow? One of the vehicles was transporting frozen body parts? Well, you did find those scratches on Ethan Chambers' arm. Maybe he had an altercation with someone... Who he killed, froze and later disposed of. I don't know. But it might be worth taking a closer look at those cars. Why did you send two pathologists to Euralla? Well, after Simon, I thought it would be good to send them both away for a while - thought they could help each other out. Well, 'helpful' isn't a word I'd associate with Harrow. I did everything right in Simon's autopsy. And he... challenged my findings and questioned me at every turn. I thought maybe he'd call to apologise, but... Why... didn't you speak with Simon's sister? Our job is to help determine cause of death. It's half the job. We don't perform autopsies for the sake of the dead. We do them for the living. To find answers, to provide some comfort. Harrow lost someone he really loved. He was absolutely wrong to challenge you like that, but... ...it's just his way of dealing with his grief. And if you weren't so busy avoiding your own, you might have seen that. So, the chemist and Ross Moran were mates from the racetrack? Yeah. And I think the chemist owed someone money, big money. And then Moran turns up dead. But here's the thing - Moran assaulted Simon before he died. Dad thought it was all connected - his shooting, the car burning, the fentanyl, Simon's death. And then he just backed off and I don't know why. Because the guy who shot your dad is dead. Because his car was a shitbox. Because Simon's death was an accident. It says it right there. Where you going? Well, the chemist must know something. I'm gonna go talk to him. Are you crazy?! For all we know, that could be the guy who killed Moran. Well, he must know something, Cal. Well, then, I'll come with you. No, no, you've... you've got work. Stay. Please, don't go see that guy alone. Wait for me. Wait for your dad. Promise me you won't go near him. I won't go near him. Bye. So, we checked both vehicles. No sign of any body parts but we did find this in Ethan's sedan. Hunting knife. It was tucked away under the seat. I've asked Scientific to confirm. Now, the knife was wrapped up in this old blanket, also stained. I'm starting to think you may be right - that Ethan disposed of a body, or part of a body. A body that had been frozen. Somewhere between here and Adelaide. That's one hell of a search area. I'm also chasing a search warrant for his house. He lives with his mother but she's not being very cooperative. Sounds like a man with something to hide. Better get these to the airport. They're holding the plane for me. It was touch-and-go for a while there. We'll keep him sedated overnight but I'm hoping he'll make a good recovery. Only to wake up and find out his wife is dead. That's not a conversation I'm looking forward to. Well, I'd be more than happy to speak to him, once he wakes. No, I couldn't ask you to. No, I... I'd like to. It might be easier coming from an old friend. Thank you, Doctor. Everything they say about you is true. And what exactly DO they say about you? You know how much I like a mystery, but this one, I can't work out. The whole town loves you. Why? It's clearly not because of your personality and it's certainly not because of your looks. Something happened here. What did you do? Must be Pavich. You should get that. This isn't over. Harrow. Hey, it's me. Oh... hi. Look, uh, you might want to call me back later. I know things have been a bit tense between us lately, which is weird, given we had sex the first night we met. If I were to tell you it's not what you think, would you believe me? What are you doing? We need to talk about this. I'm not sure if it's any of your business. No, you're right. Who Grace invites between her sheets is her business. Well, what, then? I don't want to see her getting hurt. Grace doesn't need that. I would never do that to her! You'd never MEAN to, but it's what you do, Harrow. You put people second to the job and they end up getting hurt. I mean, just look at... Simon?! He adored you. All he wanted was to be just like you. I loved him! And he loved you. And look what happened! You're not a bad man, Harrow. But you ruin people. Harrow... Harrow? ...Bungan Head, second, Grey Arm, third is Malina. They're followed by Cool Jester, Karouche, then back, Scarlet Kingdom, followed by Great Judge, Little Ben, Karitto King to Lightning Flash, and Gypsy Magic came home in last place. What are you doing! Mum, get off me! You're following me? You were following him. You were just about to harass your accuser. No, no, you don't understand. No, I don't understand! You're chasing your father's theories. You're still seeing Callan. You're begging to be arrested. I have to do something. Dad was right - my arrest, his shooting, it's all connected! If that's the truth, then the cops will sort it out. No, bullshit! They won't! They'll just pin it all on me! This is not gonna keep you out of jail! Yeah, neither will throwing money at some idiot lawyer! Fern, your father hasn't been himself since the shooting. You think Dad's wrong about this, but he's not. Dad's never wrong. And what if, this time, he is? He can't prove any of it. He's given up. Doesn't that say something to you? No signal. I hate the outback. You don't like it? Not hungry. Sorry. Would you prefer a T-bone? Barramundi? Anything you like - it's on the house. Why is that? Because you're Lyle Fairley's assistant. Beverly mentioned you. Ah... Good old Beverly. Tell me something. What did he do? Sorry? Fairley. You obviously love the guy. I mean, look at this place. It's like a shrine to him. He's never told you? There was a house fire on one of the cattle stations outside of town. Lyle was the first on the scene. The place was an inferno. But he ran into those flames and pulled those boys out, one by one. He saved three lives that night. He never said anything. That's because he couldn't save the fourth. Thanks for doing this. I hope I haven't ruined your evening. In Euralla?! It's not like I had a hot date lined up. Have you seen the guys in this town? It's all high-vis and bullshit. Literally. Here's the histology slide you asked for. The fingertip. Thank you. What are you looking for? Free blood cells. Why? Ah... Look at the margin of the tip, where the flesh has been severed. See the blood cells? They're everywhere. Which means that blood was still circulating when the tip was frozen. So, this person was alive when freezing occurred. Alive, but suffering from frostbite. Frostbite? It's 40 degrees out there. How? I have no idea. Is Fairley joining us? He's getting ready for the prayer service today for Bob and Diane. But it's a good thing you're here. I just got the report from Scientific. And? They've confirmed that a fourth person was in one of the vehicles. Ethan Chambers's car? No. Bob and Diane's. They found blood from an unknown person on Diane's clothes. There were traces of it on the steering column as well. Perhaps they were trying to climb out over Diane, after the van had rolled. Explains how the blood ended up on her clothes. What about the fingertip? Maybe it was severed on broken glass or metal when its owner was trying to climb out after the crash. But if there was another person in the vehicle, they're still out there somewhere, and likely in a very bad way. Then they couldn't have gone far. Get onto Emergency Services. We need a search party at the crash site ASAP. And get onto Cunnamulla, see if they can spare some extra bodies. We're gonna need all the help we can get. What are you up to now? I'm improvising. Here, stir this. What is that? It's a piece of car seat from the transit van. It had an unusual stain on it. So, I'm trying to determine if it's biological. Why? Because there was another person in the van when it crashed. The middle seatbelt had been adjusted to extra-long. I think that person was pregnant, hence the pregnancy stick. Did you swipe that from the lab? Well, it depends. Are you gonna tell Beverly? I only tell her what she needs to know. Now, if I'm lucky, there'll be enough fluid from the car seat for this pregnancy stick to detect human chorionic gonadotropin. HCG. Placental hormone. Also found in amniotic fluid. What on earth is all this? Just a little experiment I've rigged up. For the purposes of the autopsy, I hope. Oh, absolutely. Dr Harrow wouldn't waste hospital resources on anything else. Ron from the Post Office dropped these off. They're addressed to Diane but... ...she's in your care now, so... Mail-order pharmaceuticals. I thought it might be relevant, but I wasn't sure. Contraceptive pills. But Diane had a hysterectomy. Why would she need contraceptives? 'Cause they weren't her pills. Do you have a car I can borrow? I saw you outside the church. Ruth... Why didn't you come inside for Diane's prayer service? The boys would have loved to have seen you. Everyone would have. I wanted to. I just... I couldn't. I'm so grateful, you know? Yes? There was a pregnant woman in Bob's van. Her waters broke during the crash. What?! She must have wandered away from the accident site. But she's still out there. I tried to call Colin but I couldn't get through. Where are you? I'm on my way to Bob and Diane's. What? Why?! There were pills, contraceptive pills, sent to Diane in the mail. No, there must be some mistake. Diane couldn't have children. I'm starting to think Bob and Diane aren't the people you thought they were. Try to... look... We'll meet... on... This is exactly the sort of maverick behaviour he indulges in all the time. Jumping to ridiculous conclusions about people he doesn't even know. Where's Bob? Get in there! Let me out! Bob... No! No! Help! No! Bob?! I know what happened, Bob! I know what you and Diane did to that girl. You kept her locked up in that room! And you used her as, what... ...a sex slave?! I know you gave her contraceptives, Bob... ...thinking she might never get pregnant. But she stopped taking them. Maybe she thought... ...if she was pregnant, you might let her go. Can't keep a baby locked up in there. Right? Not YOUR baby. Shut up! So, you tried to get rid of her before the baby was born. You put her in here, to try and freeze her to death. But she was clever. She must have got quite some distance before you found her. Stop! Help! Stop! Please! Stop! Let's go, Bob. But a car crash was the last thing you were expecting. Let me out! Shut up! Let me go! What happened? The girl caused the accident. You won't get away with this, Bob. Yeah, we'll see. The cops know I'm here. They will find out what you and your wife have done. Bob? Bob! What the hell are you doing? Where is he? Where's Bob? Lyle? Oh, Bob... No, no, no, stay back. Now, come on, Bob. Don't do anything rash. Yah! Hah! Osotogari. It's one of the original 40 throws. I shall never mock your jujitsu again. Call Colin. Four bars?! How do you get four bars out here?! Lyle? No, it's Dan Harrow. I'm here, with your brother. We apprehended Bob at his property. I'll send a car but I need both of you here, now. Where is she? - Oh, down there. Thank you. - Quick as you can. If we don't get the baby out now, we could lose both of them. Contractions? Every two minutes. And her name? Kyra. Kyra? Hi. I'm Dr Harrow and this is Dr Fairley. Two doctors? It's your lucky day. Now, look, Kyra, we are going to get through this together. And Dr Fairley here, he's gonna deliver. What? You did a semester of obs. That was 25 years ago. And I know you haven't forgotten. You can do this, Lyle. Alright. OK, Kyra. Let's do this together. Here come the shoulders now. Ahhhhh! Good girl. Yeah... It's a little girl! Here. And so beautiful. I was hitch-hiking down to Adelaide when they picked me up. They seemed nice. And when we got to Euralla, they... ...offered me a place to stay for a couple of nights. How long were you there? Three years. I fought back. Every day. I did... every... thing I could to get out But they were just as determined as I was. I didn't think that they could hurt an unborn baby. I was wrong. You saved her. No. She saved me. You boys better get going if you want to make that plane. Yes. Well... ...thank you, Colin. Seriously? Oh... Come on. Ohhh! Come on... Oi! Come on. I'll see you out. Uh, hello? Forgotten something? My car keys. Shit! Yeah, sorry! Completely forgot. Thank you. It's about the puzzle, isn't it? That's why you do this. Seems you like solving puzzles too. Take care, Edwina. Wasn't the plane supposed to be here at 4:00? You OK? We did a good thing today. I know. I wanted to apologise for what I said to you yesterday. You have nothing to apologise for. You're right. Simon was obsessing over my case. If he hadn't mixed his epilepsy drugs with modafinil, then... I'll never forgive myself for what happened. You kept asking me why I had been so snippy with you. It wasn't just because of Simon. It was also because... ...I love this place... ...and I hate it too. Because of the fire. I was meant to be at the hospital that night, working. But I was at another property, looking into an unusual death, when the call came through. I was in the local fire brigade back then. They knew that the hospital was close to the house, so I got the first call. But it took me an extra five minutes to get to that fire. And that boy died... ...because was off, indulging my curiosity on a case that wasn't even mine. I promised myself I would never let that happen again. Well, you stuck your neck out today and look what happened. You saved three of us. Oh, it's Colin. "Your flight's been cancelled. "But Maxine says you can keep the rental." We have to drive back?! It's only six hours. Six hours?! In a car, with you?! Come on, Harrow. It'll be fun! Besides, I've got plenty to keep us occupied. I downloaded a new opera. I like opera. A Chinese opera. In Cantonese. Does it have to be this loud?! Oh! Now who's being snippy? You don't know who I am but... I know what you did. You're the girl from the racetrack. Why are you following me? You planted that fentanyl in my apartment. You robbed yourself so you could get out of your debt. I don't know what you're talking about. I could end up in jail for what you did. I didn't set you up. I don't even know where you live. Bullshit! You and Moran are both involved in this. Did you kill HIM? Ross Moran's dead? You have to get out of here... No! I'm not going anywhere until I have answers. Look, I'm so sorry you got caught up in this. I had no idea what he was gonna do with those drugs. No, no! Who? Who are you talking about?! Look, you have to leave now! Please, tell me who did this to me! Look, the less you know, the better. Now, go! What are you doing up here? Why did you hang up on me? Because your uncle heard everything. He knows? What were you calling me about? Maxine suggested that I may have been... ...insensitive about Simon. The way I was proprietary about his autopsy. And that I'm not good at dealing with grief. And I'm not good at being wrong. But I was wrong about the modafinil. I think I've been wrong about a lot of things lately. Your uncle thinks I ruin people. Well, what do YOU think? I think that too. But I really don't want to do that to you. I can take care of myself. I know you can. You better answer that. Your office, now. Shut the door. You know we monitor the browsing history of our employees, right? Oh... Is this about those cat videos. That includes network files, emails, keystrokes, instant messages. What's this about, Maxine? How many people have you told about Chester? Fern was in here... yesterday. She cracked your password and got access to all your autopsy files. Ross Moran and Simon. Now, I don't know what you've told her but this has to stop. Unless you know something I don't. No. Good. Then let it go, Daniel, before somebody else gets hurt. I'm sorry. Did that hurt? What have you done? What WAS that? Succinylcholine. No... No! That drug does work quite fast. Please... I have a wife! A son! Mm. Why are you doing this? You promised if I got you the fentanyl, you'd leave me alone. I'd love one of these. They're just so bad for your health. Don't do this! Please, Francis! No! No! Aagh! Please! Next on Harrow... Fern Harrow, you are under arrest for arson. Fern would never do something like that. Well, who did? I have got to prove that Chester is still alive. Louise Chester... My son committed awful crimes but he is dead now. I don't think he is. This is Taylor Ford. She's very big in the alternate therapy world. What's the big mystery? I've got a bloke standing over the top of her body who's sent her death threats. My boyfriend is not a killer.
