 The Curious... they say he collects strange tales and if you ever hear his whistle, you know something creepy is about to unfold. No one knows where he's from or where he's going to or just how many stories he's collected over the years. Hundreds? Thousands? Maybe more. What would you do if your friend was in trouble? Would you go to extremes to save them? Even if it means putting your own life in grave, grave danger? "History is full of great male friendships."

 "Julius Caesar and Mark Anthony." "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini." "James T. Kirk and Mr. Spock." "But what does it mean to call someone your best friend?" "Friendship isn't about what you get from someone." "It's about what you give to them." What if I give you a wedgie? That make us friends? Zip it, Kelsey. "A friend is always there for you, no matter what." "My dad says if you can get six friends" "to stand at your funeral," "six friends you've known your entire life," "then you've done something right." Now, in the words of Carol King...

 Thank you, Mr. Willoughby. But I'm not finished. Oh, trust me, you're finished. But... If I just give you the A now, will you sit down? Okay, everybody open your textbooks to page 365, chapter 36. The works of Bruce MacDonald. Look at this guy. What a nerd. Look at that kid. Hey, Willoughby. Heads up. Ooh, nice catch. Not bad, huh? You need anybody else for your group? It's called a team, doofus, and we're full up. Nerd. - Parkinson. - Here. - McGrady. - Here. - Koureshi. - Here. Small. Here. Stevens. Stevens. Has anyone seen David Stevens? Uh, sir. Ah-ah. Everyone, sit down, please. Stevens! Hey, sir. Sorry I'm late, sir. Ugh! What is that smell? That is gross. Are you all right? Yes. What happened to you? Nothing, sir. I fell into a pond. You got a change of clothes? My gym stuff. Go change. And, um, have a shower. You smell like Swamp Thing's armpit. Thank you, sir. Tiger. Here. Trent. Hey! Dave, what pond did you fall into? Kelsey says you ratted me out. What? I wouldn't rat anybody out. Dave, you know me. Well, are you calling me a liar? No. All I'm saying is this is just a really big misunderstanding. - Kelsey says you told Moss. - Clobber him, Stevens. Yes, but that's because he asked where you were. I just pointed you out. I didn't realize it was a bad idea. Why would you do something so stupid? Well, because you looked scared and I was worried about you. That's so sweet. Hear that, boys? He wubs you, Stevens. He wubs you so much. Next time, just mind your own business. Hey, Stevens. Can I have my comic back? You gonna let him get away with that? Penzer. Here. Parkinson. Here. McGrady. Here. - Koureshi. - Here. - Slattery. - Here. - Small. - Here. Stevens? Where's Stevens? Sir, can I go to the bathroom? Oh, that's what that smell was. All right, Kelsey, that's enough. Tiger. What are you doing? Okay. Dave. Dave! Dave, you all right? Dave? What is this place? Dave? Dave, where'd you go? Ah! Oh. Okay. Dave, you in here? Oh. Oh! Oh! Just a... just a painting... of a creepy old man. Ha. Nothing to be afraid of. Don't suppose you know where Dave is, do you? On second thought, don't answer that. Please don't answer that. Dave, you better not be about to jump out on me. Ah! Oh! Dave. Okay. Okay. Ah, I don't wanna. Nope, you gotta. You have to. Okay, come on, Gregster. Okay, okay. For Dave. Dave Greg? Greg! Here's your hat back. Thanks. Um, what you have found here is one of the most amazing discoveries. I'm still trying to figure out if it's like a regular wormhole or some kind of other dimensional rift. It's baffling. Oh! Oh! Okay, that's not a wormhole. Greg... don't move. Why? You're only going to make it upset. You need to go now. It? Oh! Okay, okay. Um... What was that? What... This is not normal. Okay. Just... Okay, um, what was that? I don't know. I just know I gotta get rid of it. Why? Who wants lemonade and cookies? My Aunt Abigail. Do not speak a word of this to her. All right. Oh, thank you, baby. Oh, goodness. Now, who's your little friend here? Uh, this is Greg. Craig? Greg. She's kind of hard-of-hearing. Greg. Oh, I haven't seen you in a long while. Are you gonna help Dave clean out the shed? Yeah. I'm gonna be so happy to have your granddad's stuff gone. That man was obsessed with gathering junk. Give me a little sugar. Gonna be good, good, I tell ya, to have this old place get a fresh start. Go on with ya. Go on. Good, go on. Lovely lady. That's why I can't have her go in that shed until I've gotten rid of whatever's in there. I'm just guessing... she doesn't know anything about it, does she? She inherited this place from my mean old grandad. She deserves a shed that's not gonna teleport her into the middle of town every time she goes in it. And I'm gonna come here every day until I've cleared it out. What? Just kind of refreshing hearing you sound like you actually care about someone else. What kind of person just abandons someone? All right, we need to get a better look at it, figure out what we're dealing with. Then, we can make a plan. We? I don't abandon people either. I got a camera. We'll catch it on film. Okay, here we go. You carry that around with you? Of course. Never know when you're gonna run into a shed monster. Right. Total nerd. Totally awesome nerd. Okay. Let's do this. All right. Remember our call signs? All right, now, what I need you to do... hold that. All right, now, hold this strap like that. Greg. Okay. Okay, it doesn't seem to mind if you nudge the stuff, but if you touch it with your hands, it flips out. Maybe because it thinks you're gonna steal it. You're right. That makes sense. Right. Greg, Greg. Behind you. Let's go! Let's go! Come on! There's another way. There's another way out. What?! Just come on. Come and get us! I've got your toy! This is getting old. What? Remember when we were seven and you fell in from the penguin enclosure at the zoo? Fell in? You pushed me. No, I didn't. You were... What? Did you see the way it reacted to the light? Like it was in pain. What are you going? Home. I've gotta develop this film, see if I'm right. Meet me at the library in the morning. It's still running. Hey. Sorry I'm late. Had to dodge Coach. Perfect timing, actually. Let's see what we've got. Oh! I barely saw anything. We've got enough. So, where's the section on shed monsters? Ha-ha. You'd be surprised what you can find in books. Yeah, here it is. Elemental shades. They don't really hide in shadows. They're made of shadows. Sound familiar? Its only weakness is light. That's interesting. How do you know so much about this stuff? I've been spending a lot of time in here lately. Greg, listen. It says shades are almost impossible to get rid of. Almost impossible. That means we still got a shot. Hey! You know, when they told me you'd be here in Loserville with Loser Boy, I didn't believe 'em. Come on, we got practice. Coach said you miss one more, you're off the team. Let's go. It's okay. Go. Actually, you know what? I think I'm good here. And his name is Greg. All right, guys, let's go. They, uh... they seem a bit unhappy with that. Just forget them. Okay. Wanna see it again? Yeah, sure. All right, let me just replay that. All right, this is the synchronized ignition device. It's a joystick. Was a joystick, okay? Stick with the program. Sure. Now, when I attach this joy... ignition device... to this remote firing mechanism... You mean... Dave, just... use your imagination, just... When that shade comes at us, he won't know what hit him. What's gonna stop him from teleporting us out again, along with the... ignition device? You see, that's what I'm counting on. Oh, that's comforting. Yeah. Remember, he won't go for you, unless you touch the stuff with your hands. Right, right. There's a place up here. Okay, he's getting feisty. All right, put that down. Uh, flip it over. Thank you. I need the twine. Thank you. Go be a distraction. Hey. You still here? Um, I just, uh... I got a few things here. Hey, look at me. I'm touching your stuff. Whoa. Uh... touching your things, right? Hey, hey, look at me. Look at me. Hey, hey. Over here. Yeah, pay attention to me. Like that, yep. Whoa, whoa. Hey. Pay attention to me. Hey. Greg, we really need to hurry this up, man. It's getting uncomfortably close. Hey, look! Hey, what don't you... pay attention to this distraction? Greg, please. I need... I need the twine. Going around. Greg, can you please hurry this up? I'm coming, I'm coming. I'm coming. All right, all right. Unravel, unravel, unravel. A lotta rope, a lotta rope. Okay. Okay, get going. Okay, all right. All right. Here it comes! There. Do it now. Fire in the hole! Give me that. It's caught on something. It's gonna break! No, it can't break. This has to work. No, just... help, help, help. Come on, come on. It's not... just... It's gonna break. Did we do it? I think we did it. High five. Oh! Oh! I'm gonna lay here. I'm laying here. Oh... Oh, yeah. Me, too. Oh, it's nice. Seriously, I don't know how to thank you. I guess I just got so caught up with my football team that I forgot who my real friends are. Okay, look, if this is an apology, can we please speed this up? I kind of hate these things. Boys, who wants chocolate volcano cake? Forget everything I just said. Every man for himself! For my hard workers. Oh, this looks amazing. Thank you. What's blazing? What? No, no, no. He said it was amazing. Oh. Right, right. Thank you. Now, now, boys, I have a small favour to ask. Yeah, sure. Go ahead. Okay, now, since you did such a fine and good job with the shed, I was wondering if you could give me some more help. Okay. You see, your granddad... he also left a mess in the basement. Do you have a shed? A basement? Anywhere dark? A place where things can hide in the shadows, watching, waiting. Are you sure you don't have a shade lurking in your home right... now?
