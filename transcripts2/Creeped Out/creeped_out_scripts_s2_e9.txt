 The Curious. They say he collects strange tales. And if you ever hear his whistle, you know something creepy is about to unfold. If a scary story went backwards... started at the end and finished at the beginning... would that somehow make it less creepy? Or is the real fear in not knowing who is messing with you and why they're doing it? Hello, watchers, and welcome to another First Thoughts with Cass.

 Must you record everything? The new Outerealm prequel came out today. Lame! We don't want to know why Wildhawk is the way she is. Movie marathon sleepover for my birthday. All six Outerealms, even the bad ones. They should be in the order of the story, shouldn't they? Mmm, if the prequels were necessary or any good. It's a "tilly stick," and it makes enemies for your enemies. And keep filming! What kind of vlogger are you? This is not how my birthday was meant to turn out! My little girl is one year older today. Let's go and wake her and her little weirdo friends up, and see what kind of state they're in.

 Bet they didn't make it through their binge watch. Outerealm always sends... what? Cass? Cass? Dad. - What happened last night? - I know what my gift is. It's Junebug. This is not how my birthday was meant to turn out! No! Why me? What comes around goes around. You've got it backwards. It's "what goes around comes around." What? How did you do that? Sucker. All you've done is shoot the messenger. When you least expect it, wish the ground would open up and swallow you. But I didn't do anything. - Didn't you? - Look! I killed it! I killed the cake! My tilly's gone! Hah! I'm never talking to you again. I only came over to watch Outerealm! Give it back! No! This is not how my birthday was meant to turn out! - No, you don't. - Hey, I was just... Please, Cass. You don't have to... Why you doing this? Just think of nothing. Let your mind go blank. It won't work. No one can think of nothing for long. Eventually something just pops into your... ...head. Well, I thought of something I can't see. So, there! - She beat it. - You can't beat it. What are you doing? There was something behind me. Did you see it? It's behind me again! What is it? I don't know. It keeps hiding behind me. Well, you can't see it, remember? So... guess you can relax. Claudia, stop it. It's right there! Claudia, stop it! It's like trying to catch the fridge light turning off! I wanna know what it is! Is it like this normally? It unfolds different each time. Why? Oh! I need to see it! I can't see it! What is it? - Your turn! - What? Me? That's not... no. Why? "Why?" Excellent question! Are the things that happen to you just random, or is there a reason? But I didn't do anything. - Didn't you? - Look! I killed it! I killed the cake! My tilly's gone! Hah! Peek-a-boo! - We have to stop. - But we're not finished. I'm finished, okay? I'm done, I'm out. Are you? Look. I've found your parents' room. - You wouldn't. - Just imagine their dreams becoming real. Or their nightmares. I once had a dream I was slowly turning into a slug. First my arms, then my legs, then my head, till I was nothing but a squidgy slug forever, and ever, and ever. I was almost sad to wake up. Fine. You win. And you can do Claudia's one. And keep filming. What kind of vlogger are you? Now, where is she? - No, you don't. - Hey, I was just... Junebug? Junebug? Junebug? Junebug? Junebug? Junebug? Alice, what are you doing in here? You can't hide from it. If I just keep my eyes peeled... Have you seen Junebug? I can't find her. Alice, it's okay. Peek-a-boo! - Make it stop, Cass! Make it stop! - Alice, relax! Peek-a-boo! - It can't hurt you. - What sort of comfort is that? Just stay here. Yeah right, I'm staying here! Peek-a-boo! What is happening? Make it stop, Cass! Tell it stop! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! I, uh... I need to go to the toilet. I'll be right back. - No, no, no... - Pull yourself together. You're forgetting why we're here. Don't you remember? Don't forget that feeling, Cass. If you're getting second thoughts, just remember what it was like to feel so confident one moment, and the next, when you least expect it, wish the ground would open up and swallow you. When you least expect it... Ow! Quit pinching me! Leave me alone! Please, cake! Just stop it! I'll do anything! Agh! - It's all right, Alice. - It's okay, I'm here. Wh-why does your hand feel so small? - Peek-a-boo! - Oh, for the love... Peek-a-boo... This is all your fault! Okay, I think it's gone far enough. We've had our fun. We should undo it all. Don't worry, guys, okay? Junebug has this special powder that undoes everything. - Right, Junebug? - You mean this? That's it. See, she can blow it on Nate and Alice, and it'll get rid of all of it. There's no such thing as undo powder. - It's sugar! - You can't undo this. What did you expect? What sort of teenager drinks rosehip tea? - Leave me alone, little dolly! - What is happening? Ow! Why is it doing that? Ow! We have a tradition in my family that you get pinched for every year of your birthday, I guess. This is all because it's the first thing that popped into his head? - Wild, isn't it? - It's different every time. What if he thought of something dangerous? What if he thought of an... an elephant? An elephant could come charging through here and trample us all to death. Why are you doing this? Why not? Alice, don't think of anything. Let your mind go blank. Yeah, don't think of an elephant. What'd you think of? What'd you think of? I tried to think of something harmless, something cute. Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! Peek-a-boo! You thought of a Peek-a-boo doll? I had one when I was little. It's not as cute as I remember. That's it? A doll she can throw away? Tillies don't give up that easily. Oh, it will be back. I think it just likes to... surprise her. Peek-a-boo! Ow! - Ow! - Told you, didn't I? Feels good, doesn't it? Why you helping me? Isn't that the most important question of all? "Why?" Mess with us how? Whatever you're thinking of when it hits will become your tilly. What's a "tilly"? A tilly latches on to you and messes with your head. What do you mean, when it "hits" us? Whatever you think of first. What? What? Cake? The cake is gonna mess with him? Real scary. The first thing you thought of is cake? I got stressed! I always think of food when I get stressed. It just pinched me. Ow! - It just pinched my leg! - You're kidding me, right? Ow! Stop it, cake! Ow! Ow! Agh! Ow! I warned you kids. Stay away from prequels. - They're bad for your health. - I liked finding out about her parents. Although it kind of made it look like she'd forgotten them in the original trilogy. It ruins everything. Mos Ducasse doesn't care about real "Realmers." And we're the ones who made his franchise great. Okay. Uh, so now, it's time to play a little game. - Is that real bone? - What is that? It's my granny's lipstick. - What do you do with it? - I'll show you. We could have ordered one ham and pineapple. - What? - No. No, no, no. You would have tried to put anchovies on it. - Anchovies on pizza are good. - No! No... Don't stay up too late. And no spooky stuff. - Someone always gets freaked out. - 'Night, Dad. - Must you record everything? - Yes. If you wanna be big online, you gotta always... - "Always be on," yeah, yeah. - Thank you. - What if you don't want to be? - Perfect. Negativity sells. You're not putting the original trilogy on first? - I figured story order. - The order they came out, right? They should be in the order of the story, shouldn't they? Mmm, if the prequels were necessary or any good. I'm looking at you, Mos. What's more important, the tornado in Texas, or the butterfly wings in Japan that created it? - What are you doing? - Time lapse. I can't ask my subscribers to sit through six hours of footage with no filter. Hi, watchers! Welcome to my birthday sleepover, which went a little something like this. Yeah! ♪ It doesn't mean that it can't be done... ♪ Wait! Yeah! ♪ You gotta run From morning to midnight ♪ ♪ And in the morning When it turns to light... ♪ - Oh, my...! - Ah-hh! Oh, you're so picky! ♪ You gotta crawl, Then walk, then run again... ♪ ♪ You gotta crawl, Then walk, then run again... ♪ Here we go. Let the party begin. - Greetings, Realmer. - Where's my present? - Am I not gift enough? - Obviously not. - ♪ Ta-da! ♪ - Wow! I wonder what that could be. - It's a scooter. - That was a joke, "Muttley." I know it was a joke. I was taking her dumb and raising it. Oh, yeah, there's someone else coming. - What? - Who? My mum made me invite the new girl. My mum's such a do-gooder. I'm sorry. Hey. Everyone, this is Junebug. Junebug, this is everyone. I... I don't know what I did. I don't know why... You don't have to hide your tears. You don't have to look. You're Junebug, right? What would you say if I told you I know who did this? Who? I can help you get revenge. What comes around goes around. - What is that? - It's a "tilly stick." Some people call it a "tilly bone." It makes enemies for your enemies, if you want to mess with them in... unique and inventive ways. That's not really my style. This is undo powder. If it gets too much, or you want to put everything back the way it was, we just use this. I'm having a sleepover this weekend for my birthday. I'll pretend my parents made me invite you. So today's "Westaway Day," which means I get to dress up as, you guessed it, Wildhawk from Outerealm! I know, not very original of me, but... Oh, wow. Looking good, Cass. Cass, as your friend, I have to tell you that this is a miscalculation. Why is everyone in uniform? The note said we had to dress up. If it's any conso, awesome Wildhawk. Cass, this is fake. You've been stitched up. Are you okay? I wish the ground would open up and swallow me. Who would do this? - Cass' locker! - Okay, whoa. Look at that! I could be a counterfeiter. Destroy the original. Someone's coming! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Hey, Realmers. I was just thinking about you. Three little tillies, all in a row. The best Outerealm isn't Red Run. It's... stop it. - I still say Viridian Vac is. - Oh-hh! It's good, you guys! Wildhawk crushing Nix? You need to speak quietly. The Internet will hear you. Two words, Ally-pally. Stop it! Are those your two words? Anyway, we can have this debate properly at my house in exactly one week. Movie marathon sleepover for my birthday. All six Outerealms, even the bad ones. Oh, that reminds me. Which one of you is pranking me? Hold this. What is that? "I see from your profile you have a birthday coming up. I'm sending you a little something. This is a gift you don't unwrap. It unfolds." Um... Oh, come on, you guys. Look who it's signed by. "Mos Ducasse." You made him mad. Oh, yeah, like the reclusive creator of the Outerealm canon sees little old me tearing his creation apart? Okay? They don't watch fan vlogs. Hey, check it. - New girl. - She's pretty. Look at that. Girl after your own heart. It's your evil twin. Okay, anyway. So, my party... I must warn you guys, it's gonna be pretty low-key. Hello, watchers, and welcome to another First Thoughts with Cass. So, the new Outerealm prequel came out today, and first thoughts... Just why? Ugh! What was the point of the light fight? What was the point of Lax? The Protava People? Lame! We don't want to know why Wildhawk is the way she is. She's cooler when we don't know, you fools! But you had to do it, Mos. You had to go there. You had to go backwards, like somehow knowing the beginning of the story at the end answers all of our questions! Well, it doesn't. Just because you created this world, mister, doesn't mean it's yours to ruin. Delivery. Movie marathon sleepover for my birthday. All six Outerealms, even the bad ones. I'm lookin' at you, Mos. The new Outerealm prequel came out today. Lame! You need to speak quietly. The Internet will hear you. Yeah, right, like the reclusive creator of the Outerealm canon sees little old me tearing his creation apart? "I see from your profile you have a birthday coming up. I'm sending you a little something..." - Signed by... - Mos Ducasse. "This is a gift you don't unwrap. It unfolds." - New girl. - She's pretty. Look at that. Girl after your own heart. Some people call it a "tilly bone." It makes enemies for your enemies. - What is that? - I know what my gift is. It's Junebug. Sucker. All you've done is shoot the messenger. No one likes to be picked on. So if you're thinking about doing it, maybe think twice. Because that first thought might just create your worst enemy.
