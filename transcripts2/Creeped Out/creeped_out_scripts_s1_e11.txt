 The Curious. They say he collects strange tales, and if you ever hear his whistle, you know something creepy is about to unfold. No one knows where he's from or where he's going to, but apparently, he can keep perfect time in his head, to the second. Some believe that if you do something bad, then eventually something bad will happen to you. But what if this wasn't just the universe at work but a being, a creature,

 that you couldn't outrun? Look who it is: Bonnie and Clyde. Uh, it's actually Brandon and Jodi. I know who you are, genius, and I know what you've been doing. Red-handed. It's a slippery slope, kids. One day you're harmless little hooligans; The next, you're Bas Warren. Is that what you want? No, I don't. I look terrible in bright colours. How do you think he ended up doing community service? I caught him stealing, like I just caught you.

 Oh, Mrs. Gunson. Always a pleasure. And what's my darling daughter done now? I really hate doing this, June. You understand? Sure you do. Really hate it. It's a slippery slope, isn't it? One day they're harmless hooligans; The next, they're... Bas Warren. I know. You have mentioned it once or twice. When Bas was your girl's age, he was stealing chocolate bars. Now, it's TVs and computers. It'll all catch up with him one day. Mark my words. I'll take it from him, Mrs. Gunson. Thanks so much. You, uh, better head home, Brandon. I'll make sure he gets there. Good luck. Chat time, young lady. "You don't want to end up like Bas Warren." That busybody can talk. She's been stealing from charity boxes for years. Only difference is she gets away with it. Hmm. But that doesn't mean she's wrong about you. Whose side are you on? Look, Mum. We weren't... Doing anything? I know. Hey, you should have that printed on a T-shirt. Well, I would rock that. Big head. Go on with you. Get off. What is going on, Jodes? I can't seem to get through a single day without a phone call or someone knocking at my door. Oh, popular. Look who's got the big head now. It's not a good thing, the complaining about you. Here, at school. I mean, everywhere you go, trouble seems to follow. I've been on a 12-hour shift. I look like the walking dead, and you're obviously grounded. What? Amazing. You sound surprised every time. What happened? Parents weren't home. You should have seen Gunson's face. Totally ruined the fun. What about you? Grounded, "obviously." But she never said I wasn't allowed visitors. I thought you said you were good at football. Real football. If you take this down the park, I'll thrash you. You wish. Not with them chicken legs you won't. Oh, it's on now. Yeah, whatever. You better watch out, Chicken Boy. Back on the tackle, mate, 'cause here it comes. No, no! Boom! Six-nil. Shh. It's awesome, this. Wish I could have the place to myself all the time. Do you want a one? Want a one? What about me? I better be included in this made-up world of yours. Like I need you hanging about annoying me all day. Yeah, yeah. You'd miss me, really. Oi! You are so going to get it. Whoa, don't. Truce, truce! What's going on? What are you doing? I'm so sorry. I... Home, Brandon. Now. It was an accident. Honest. And Brandon coming over when you're grounded, that was an accident, too? Do you care about me at all? It's only a TV. Only a... I need to clear this up. You better get out of here now. He came for me. He came for me. What? Who did? The thing with blue skin. He did this to me with his hand. I'm sorry. I've got to go. Hey, it's me, Jodi. Bas. Bas Warren. I was frozen, but I could move with the hand. Look. Do you need some help? I took it. He can't punish anymore. Punish? Wait. That's not yours. I just saw that old man leave it. Looks antique, expensive. I'll see he gets it back. No, you won't. You'll steal it, like you do with everything else round here. Let's call it payment, shall we, for not telling these kind folks who's been water-bombing their windows. I know a man who pays a good price for this old stuff. Let's see what's inside. That's it? Useless. Oh, you're home. We need to... What's that? Oh, this? Uh, nothing. I just found it. So, why you hiding it? Oh, Jodi, for once, can you please just tell me the... Mum? Truth? Tell me what this case is. Uh, it's a disappearing box. When you press a button, it disappears. Okay. Enough with the gam... Ames. What have you done with it? With what? Jodi, please. I feel like you're taking years off me, Jodi. You're not going to see Brandon for a while. What? I've already spoke with his parents. And you're not leaving this room for the rest of the weekend. Aren't I? Hmm. Oh! How did you do that? Oh, this is amazing. You know how we're always saying how cool it would be if we could do anything we wanted without anyone stopping us? Brando, this thing freezes time! Yeah, of course it does. No, come on. Press it with me. What? Why? Well, it doesn't freeze the person pressing. Must just be how it works. Come on. And press. This is nuts. I know. Where did you get that thing? Online. Seriously? No. You are so gullible. This old guy chucked it. He said his name was Bas Warren. What? Don't ask. You want to go and have some fun? Oh, yeah. Okay. I see where we're going. Ha-ha. Much tastier. I think someone needs a shower. And now. Press it, quick. So cool. So quiet. It's like we've been left alone in the world. Zombie apocalypse, more like. They're not dead, just stuck in a moment. So, what now? We can literally do anything. Do you want to raid some fridges? Your mum and dad have so much junk food. I've got a serious sugar crash. Me, too. Think about it. The whole world is frozen right now. Everyone in Australia, the president of America, the Queen. People right now are in the middle of jumping out of an airplane, or giving birth. Or going to the toilet. Ew. Tell me that was your. Not this time. What are you doing? Come on, chicken legs. Let's go check it out. Mrs. Gunson's locker. Who did this? I thought we had the world to ourselves. Tell me you can hear that. Come on. He's coming. Brandon, freeze. What was that? The guy with the blue skin. What? The old guy with the case mentioned it. He said he had skin like that. Mrs. Gunson's place. What's that noise? Shh! What are you doing to me? I wasn't stealing. I was borrowing. What's he looking for? Run. What was all that stuff? The electric hands beat? I don't know. It was like he was turning her into an old lady. Like Bas Warren. That old guy was him. Look. Bas gave me this. That thing must have left it on him. Same as Gunson. "Punished." That's what he meant. Bas was a thief, right? "Take and I'll take from you." That freak punished Bas for stealing. And he did the same to Gunson because she stole the case. And then I stole it from her. Oh, he's going to fry me, too. Not if we give it back. What are you talking about? Jode, he can't punish you for stealing something if we give it back. That's just borrowing. Where is he? Shh. Look. You've got your case. Now just leave me alone. Now what does he want? What do you want? He's got what you took. Why is he still coming? Come on. Come on, come on! If it's not the case, then what did you take? I don't know. I've never stolen anything. We need to find somewhere to hide. Jodi, come on. What do we do? Hide! Mum? I didn't know about any holiday fund. Jodes... Quick, Brandon, run! Come on. Hey, what are you doing? No. Wait, wait, please! I'm the one who took the case. Me. But please, please don't hurt him. I mean, if you take him, then I have nothing. You mean, that's it? That's it? You're punishing me by taking away what matters to me. Oh, please. Don't hurt Brandon. I need him. What did she take? You've got your case. What did she take? I feel like you're taking years off me, Jodi. It's not about taking the case. That's not why you're after me. Taking an idea from you, you don't just punish someone for doing one thing. It's everything put together. But what did you take? My mum's happiness. I mean, I never stopped having fun to know that I was stealing it from her. But please, don't take Brandon. I need him! I'm the one you want. Wait, wait. What if she fixes it? What if she gives the happiness back? She gets it now. She'll make it right. Promise, Jodi? I promise. Deal. Could we please make my mate pay full price? So, that's your games console and my one bit of happiness gone. Thanks, Brandon. So, that's it. There's nothing left of yours to sell. That's okay. I think this is enough. Yesterday, what you said to that thing... Am I really your best friend? Well? You are so gullible, Brandon. You'd miss me, really. Oh get out of here, chicken legs! The next time you're alone and you think no one is going to find out, be sure to choose your actions carefully, because there's something out there, waiting in between time, and it knows if you've been good and it will certainly find you if you haven't.
