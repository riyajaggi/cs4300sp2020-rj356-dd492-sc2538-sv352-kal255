 Ace the Amazing Aromarologist! What others call an oddity, we call a gift! Ladies and gentlemen, I give to you Indigo the Flying Sprite! I'll show her the ropes, boss, starting with the boundary. Zephaniah can't know about this. I started having these dreams. Images of the outside world. Places, things, people. I think my dreams are my real memories, Indigo. This is where I'm from!

 My real home. I know the truth! Our memories are fake! That water tower, it's where they are. Then, come morning, with the help of this drawing I will take you there. Are you sure you want to do this? Sad. See you later, Tiny. You're making a mistake, but good luck. I didn't mean for him to find your journal. I'm so sorry. Don't be.

 Don't you see? Everything worked out. Thanks to you, I'm going home. Bye! Bye! Take it easy! Take care of yourself now. Bye! See ya! I never liked these places. Why not? They never liked me. It all looks the same. Where is it? I don't have any more clues! Boy, we've been driving around this town in circles. I'm sorry, we tried. Come on, we must get back. It's been hours. There! Look, that house and the letterbox. It's all the same! We did pass this house coming into town. Perhaps that's why it made its way into your dreams. No, that's it! That's my home. Are you sure you want to do this? Hello. Mom? I'm sorry? It's me, I'm your son. I... Honey, who is it? Dad! I-I think he's confused. Why are you saying this? Don't you recognize me? Who is he, Mom? I know all of you. What's going on? Forgive his confusion. He's a foundling. He really wanted this to be true. Take me home. Ace? Ace! You're not just giving up. Ace, those memories were real. They were just dreams. No, no, they weren't. They were too real. The truth is still out there waiting to be found. We just... We just have to know where to look for it. Think of your family. Zephaniah is my family. Haven't you done enough damage? We just need to know where to look... for the truth. Pleasing, phenomenal. Ace the Amazing Aromarologist! We've never met before, have we? So, there's no way I could know anything personal about you. Like for instance, the fact that you keep a picture of your wife in your left breast pocket? Oh, uh, sorry. That's you, sir. I-I mean your daughter. Gudge! Gudge! Indigo's up next. Where is she? I... Ladies and gentlemen! Boys and girls! Looking for this? Beautiful, aren't they? My collection. Each one has a very special kind of magic, but this one... Is the most precious of all. It's the very reason why none of your memories are real. Ah! We wouldn't want the others finding that out, would we? You can't stop me from telling them. On the contrary... I'm sorry? You were saying? Let me show you what happens to traitors. There are some among you who believe I elicit pleasure from this. Let me assure you I do not. However, it's as clear as glass. Anyone who refuses to learn should be taught in a different way. Behold the consequences for those who break the rules. Don't do this! It's not fair. Yeah, just let her be! Maybe I should teach you all! Come on, let her go. Quiet. Enough. Let her go. Don't be frightened. Or should I punish them all? No! Stop, Ace! Let me go. Ace, please! Ace, stay here. It's a drawing of an eye. It's not just any eye. It's Zephaniah's! What? Indigo wanted us to destroy it? Why? I don't know. She was in his caravan. She knows. She risked everything to get this. So, if she tells us to destroy it, then I believe her. You're talking about the man who took us in. Cared for us! But what if he didn't? What if all of our memories are lies? We liked Indigo, too, but this isn't going to get her back. But what if it gets us to our real homes? Ah... ah... Ah-choo! Treason! This way, Ace! Run! Whoa! Ugh! Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? There it is! Looking for this? Ah! Go get it. Look at the star of the show now. It's all your fault, you know. Indigo, you sealed that poor girl's fate the moment that you gave her that drawing. And now, you've brought all your friends into it, too! And because of you, I'll have to punish them all! No! Zephaniah, no, please! Ace is family! Please don't hurt us! We'll be good! We promise, Zephaniah! Oh! No! Herc, catch! Crush. No! That's why we have these skills. We're animals? You turned us into people to use us?! But-but my loyal performers... You lied to us! No, I merely distorted the truth. Filled us with sad memories, and forced us to perform! But I... I gave you the greatest gift of all. The gift of the spotlight. That wasn't your choice to make! No! Where are you taking me? Please! No, no! No! Help! Indigo! I'm sorry, Indigo. Bye, Ace. Bye, Indigo. Um, do you have a 6? Ooh, just picked it up. Your turn, Pa. Is it my turn? Okay. Do you have an 8? Mom, Mom, look! It's him! He's back! Come here, Ace! Come here, Ace! Hi! Good boy, Ace! Hi! We missed you! Welcome home, buddy! Do you have a talent? A special gift? Where did it come from? Was it inherited? Was it pure luck? Or maybe, just maybe, that gift came from your true form. What if, deep down, you too were once an animal?
