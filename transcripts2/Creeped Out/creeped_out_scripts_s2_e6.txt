 [narrator] The Curious. They say he collects strange tales. And if you ever hear his whistle, you know something creepy is about to unfold. [phone buzzes] Do you love taking photos? Have you ever stopped to think what happens when the images go online? - [slurping] Well, maybe it's time you started. Before it's too late. [theme music playing]

 Kiera, we cannot be late again. I'm done covering for you. Just grabbing my wake-up shot. But you've been up for hours. [yawns] [camera shutter clicks] One more try. Key, seriously. This is important. Uh... so is this. [chuckles] [camera shutter clicks] [Marcy] Hi. This week at Zucco's, two for one. Hi, there! Two for one? So, hey, I was thinking, maybe Saturday, we could skip work? Concentrate. You're missing people. Only it's the dairy festival thingy. Starts at 1:00.

 Now. Worky time. This week at Zucco's, two for one! [Marcy] Hi, there! Two for one? Make it three for one, you've got yourself a deal. Brock. Hey. Sorry, Dad does the deals. I'm just the flyer girl. No, I know. I was... joking? Oh! Right, no, I was joking. [laughs] About your joking. Right. [camera shutter clicks] Your sister loves a selfie. Yeah, well... we better get on, actually. Okay, well, thanks, flyer girl, for the... "Joking about your joking"? Key? Kiera? ♪ Whoo! Come on! ♪ - [indistinct chatter] - [music playing] Sorry, just me. Don't worry, the pretty one's bringing over your shakes. - Kiera! - What? Oh! Oh! Sorry. I had a bit. - Hey, Brock. - Hey. Don't worry, we'll bring you a new one. Try not to drink any more profits, yeah? You know what this place is lacking? A big old family photo above the counter there. All my beautiful Zucco babies! Not again with the photo, Mom. Look, I'm just trying to spice the joint up a bit. Bring in a warm vibe. Well, I'd rather get warm meals out to paying customers. Pick up the pace, Marcy. Remember, I'm counting on you girls. Reputation is everything. Okay, Dad. I'm doing my best. [camera shutter clicking] [beeps] So perfect. Gross. [sighs] [clicking, beeps] [music playing over phone] "Flaw Fader. Takes the best of you." - [boy] Selfie! - Sammy! Hey! It's like they just popped up overnight. Don't tell me you're still getting zits at your age? You're hilarious, Mom. Someone's been posting fake photos and harsh reviews about the diner. [Dad] I bet you a ten it's that new gelato place on Elm Avenue. Out to ruin me. It's like I always say, girls... [both] "Reputation is everything." Exactly. So, what we thinking, Marcy? Deleting his text and photos? That's child's play. But if we really wanna send a message, I could track his IP and send over a nasty little virus - I've been saving up. - Whoa! Whoa! Just delete, okay? [Kiera] Sammy! He's got his own phone. Why's he always stealing mine? - Come on, Glams. - Here. Come and let me show you how to take a real photo. Come on, Marce, get in. We can get that photo for the diner. Good luck with that. Marce is a full-on photophobe. Yep, and proud of it. [camera shutter clicking] - Want me to stick this in the wash? - Sure. You're welcome, Your Highness. So, did you think about it? The festival? Dad needs us, Kiera. The diner needs us. You know how stressed he is. Try thinking of someone else for a change. Other than your selfie. Hilarious. I'm just trying to have a laugh. You do remember what that feels like, don't you? - Yeah? - Don't you dare. Kiera! [both laughing] Oh, Marce, wait. You know about apps and stuff like that, right? Look at this. [phone buzzes, chimes] Did that just say "From Brock"? What? No, uh, look. [music playing] - "Flaw Fader"? - It's a free download. Plus, the photos on the website look sick. I dunno. That tune is freak-show central. [Marcy] Plus, free apps, they always give you a ton of spam. Well, I can always just delete it. Whoa! You didn't even read the terms and conditions! Nerd alert. Who ever reads those things? Okay. Flaw Fader, do your worst. [camera shutter clicking] That flash look weird to you? No way! - What? - It's perfect! Okay. [camera shutter clicking] What? Wait, wait! This is insane. Dr. Giggles has never looked so cute. Look! [chuckles] - How's it do that to the image? - Who cares? My profile picture is about to get a major upgrade. Calm down, it's only a photo. Oh, you so don't get it. ♪ Why don't you take A picture of me, boy? ♪ [buzzes, music playing] "New gallery bid"? Oh, you can spam right off. Weird. Kiera! Take your time. Chill, Marce. I had to upload my new profile picture. Already got 12 likes. Wow! Expect a call from the prime minister any second. [cell phone buzzes] Don't get mad, okay, but I'm going to buy us both festival tickets. - What? - Just think about it. Hey, you never know who might be there. [music playing] [music playing over phone] [Kiera] Enough with the stupid spam. Okay, I've got one Zucco's big Aloha burg... [screams] Mommy, her face! [screams] - [Kiera] I gotta go! - Go? - Kiera, it's our busiest time! - Excuse me! Hey, you all right? Kiera, don't you even think about leaving! [Kiera panting] [woman] Watch out! - [music playing over phone] - [Kiera] What do you mean, gallery bid? [Glams] Sammy! You nearly ready, sweetheart? Yeah, Glams. [footsteps running] [door slams] Kiera? [music playing] - Nice try, faker! - Marce? Marce, something's wrong with me! - It's called being selfish. - I'm not faking, okay? Like I believe anything you say. I'm done covering for you. Done! Saw the message, by the way. From Brock, about you two meeting up. You knew I liked him. Why did you...? Whatever! Just get out here, now! Wow! - Not too overdramatic. - We did text. - I don't even care. come on! - But only about you! You're not on social media. He wanted advice. - On what? - You! He likes you. That's why I arranged for us to meet up at the festival. How else would you guys hang out? That's why you did that? Why is his...? [Kiera] Marce, there's something wrong with me. [screams] - What happened to you? - I... I don't know. - [knocks on door] - [Glams] Everything all right in there? [Kiera] Please, please. I don't wanna frighten her. - I heard a scream. - Kiera's changing, Glams. Yeah, I just spilt something on my uniform. I'm all good. Okay. Well, I'm heading off to the movies with your brother. Cool. You guys enjoy. Seriously, we gotta tell Dad. No, just help me figure this out first. Please. It doesn't make any sense. You were okay this morning. Well, my eyes were all blurry when I woke up, but... Blurry? But I just thought it was the camera flashes. From that new app? The one with the freaky flash? What? It could be a reaction to the light maybe, or... Is that all Flaw Fader? This is why you read "Terms and Conditions." But it's just an app. Where's your phone? Quick! - Uh, I left it. - [Sammy] Selfie, Glams! - Say cheese! - [Marcy] Sammy, no! - Marcy! - Please, please, please. [Glams] He was only borrowing it. - He didn't get your faces. - [Sammy] Oh, sorry. No, Sammy, it's okay. I was just... Come on, come on. Let's go. [music playing over phone] What do all these messages mean? What's a "gallery bid"? [Kiera] I dunno. I thought it was just spam. What are these coin symbols underneath your photo? - [Kiera] I've never seen that before. - [music playing over phone] "New gallery bid." Look, the number's going up! Marce, you gotta do something! Hey, there might be something online. Maybe I could track the location - of whoever made the app, and... - [Kiera] And do what? I don't know, yet. It'll be okay, Key. We'll fix this. [keyboard clicking] [Kiera] I told Glams we'd only be an hour. [Marcy] This is the location from the map. Didn't give an exact address, but there's nothing here. No offices, flats. Wait, there. "Gallery." [dog barking] [knocking] [Marcy] Hello? Hello? I said hello! Maybe we should go back. Come on. - [Kiera] Marcy? - I know. I don't like it either. [clicks] [Marcy] What is this place? Who are all these people? Key...? Come check this out. [Marcy] Kiera? What is it? [Kiera] This isn't happening. [man] Be proud. - Very few are selected for my gallery. - What have you done to me? Taken that which you hold precious and immortalized it. You're Flaw Fader. No. That's but one of my many tools. I have applications across the world. And every hour is spent searching every corner of the Web. - Why? - To find it. My next exhibit. - No, I didn't ask for this. - Oh, but you did. "Capture that 'perfect image.'" Remember? [man] Look around you. Here, you will never age. Never wither. This is how you'll remain. Perfect for purchase. [Kiera] "Purchase"? That's what they mean. The coins. You're selling faces! Oh! Only for the right price, of course, or the fairest bid, shall we say? You can't do this! But I can. "I hereby sign my image away forever." [man] A little word of advice? Always read the small print. [music playing over phone] Ah! Another interested client. [Kiera] No, this... this can't be happening. No. Please! I wanna take it back! [man] Look at the elite company you share. It is such a privilege to belong to my exhibition. No, please! I... [sobs] Uh... [Kiera] No, no, no. - What is this? - Hacking into your app? That's child's play. Let's see how your precious clients like this! - [Kiera] No, please! - Stop. Give me Kiera. I own her. You know, I've got a nasty little virus I've been saving for a day like this. - [beeping] - [keyboard clicking] - [man] This won't bring her back. - Then what have I got to lose? Stop this. Oh, I will dedicate my life to finding your apps. Messing with every bid. - [clicking] - [growls] [Marcy] You have no idea how stubborn I am, or how much I hate selfies. I'll make it so no one ever wants to bid on you again. 'Cause with an exhibition like this, reputation is everything! [yells] Stop! I'll unbind her. But never again can she use her face. She's done with your apps. 'Cause if I ever see her face again, there'll be no second chances. It'll be mine. Forever. [app music playing] Do we have a deal? I just want her back. You don't deserve my art. [screams] [screaming continues] [light switch clicks] Marce? Guess I'm not done covering for you. [footsteps running] [Marcy] Kiera, we can't be late. - Oh! - Ready to go? How you feeling? [sighs] No more apps. No more filters. From now on, I'll just try and appreciate what I've got. Oh, and... I'm how he got your number. What? [cell phone chimes] [Marcy] Brock? "Sounds like a great deal." Deal? "If you ever appear again in any photo..." Oh, Kiera, get in here! "...then both your faces will be mine forever." - [Marcy] Stop! - Come on. - Here we go. - [Marcy] Stop! Marce? [Glams] What is wrong with you? Sorry, just no photos, okay? Trust me. I need to talk to you. Why are you girls in uniform? 'Cause we got work? Not today, you don't. I reminded your father of how hard you've both been working... so... Ta-da! [Glams chuckles] [Dad] Festival starts in an hour. So you'd best get a move on. [Glams] But before you go, - something to hang above the counter. - [Dad] Oh, yes. And like I always say, reputation is everything. - Dad, don't! - Say cheese. No! [man] Forever. [narrator] Be careful what you do with your image. 'Cause you never really know if there is something out there, waiting in the shadows, preparing to steal it away. [instrumental music playing]
