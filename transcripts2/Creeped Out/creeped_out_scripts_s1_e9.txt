 The Curious... they say he collects strange tales and if you ever hear his whistle, you know something creepy is about to unfold. No one knows where he's from or where he's going to or if he has a family. Are these tales drawing him away from home or bringing him closer to one? Have you ever wondered what your parents were like at your age? What if you had the chance to meet them, do you think you'd be friends?

 Vincent. Vincent, we're here. Can we call Mum, tell her we're here? She sent us away. She can call us. She never sent us away. Andrew Jablonowski. Oh, I never thought I'd see my big brother back in Bundanoon. Look at you. Look at you, look at you. Oh, you got big, Vinnie. Uh, Vincent. He's too old for nicknames. Too old for nicknames? I bet your mum still calls you Vinnie. Come on, let's get you inside. Right, I'll go and get the kettle on.

 Oh, look how tall you are. Can't get over what a handsome little gent you've grown into. Gets his height from his mother's side. That's pure Sophie, that. I appreciate this, you putting us up. Don't be stupid. Well, it won't be forever. Good. Does that mean you'll finally get over yourself, call your wife and sort this nonsense out? It means that I'll be finding my own place, a new home. Hey. AJ. I'm fine. Auntie June? Hey. You get a good look around? Mm-hmm. It's nice. Your dad and I grew up here, you know. Such a weird place. Your dad couldn't wait to leave. Took off as soon as he was old enough, but me, I'd miss it too much. Why don't you go and explore? Go on. I'll make us some lunch. Vincent, you stay away from that... well! If you go near there again, you will be banned from the g-garden! Do you understand?! Hey, don't shout at him. I told him to go and explore. I've not heard that stammer for a long time, which means he's stressed. Don't be too hard on him. When your dad was younger, he had a best friend, a boy called Red. Red disappeared down that well. From then on, everything just seemed to unravel for your dad. Got really weird around here. Whoa. Whoa. Weird. Come on, give it to me. Oh, come on! Please! Fire, fire, fire! You're gonna do it. Fire! No, don't distract me. There's too many of them. Hello? Come on, you can do it. Careful, AJ. Don't make me tell you twice, young lady. Mom, AJ's getting close to hitting the highest score on Asteroids ever! Bath now. Sorry, AJ. Who are you? Sorry, sorry. I got lost and, um, I somehow ended up in... Your cellar. How do you end up in the cellar? What does "AJ" stand for? Andrew Jablonowski. P-p-pleased to meet ya. Who was that girl? My sister. That's June. You can ignore her. Are y-you okay? This isn't next-door. This is Bundanoon. Yeah. 1985. W-wait. W-where you going? Take me back. What? You okay, sweetheart? I didn't sleep so well. Auntie June. Hmm. You ever notice anything... weird about the cellar? Oh, I don't like to go down there. Why? No reason. Hey, make yourself useful today, will ya? Put your stuff away. And no more games. And try and get some fresh air, too. I don't understand you kids. When I was your age, we were always outside. Where'd it go? Okay, you can do this. You know what to do, so just take it steady. Oh, hey, you're bac... ah! Oh, cramp! I've got cramping leg! Ah! Ah! Grab the joystick. Joystick? Oh, the controller. One button? How many do you need? Fire! That's it. That's it. Hey, you're pretty good at this. You play Asteroids? Nope. First time. How long have you been playing? Since ten last night. I had to wait for my parents to finish watching Dallas. What's the record score? 41,336,440. Kid stayed away for two nights to get it. Almost killed him. Oh, man. Sorry. No probs. G-got my whole life to beat it. You want to go outside? Outside? Why? C-come on. I'll show you my Star Wars collection. You like Star Wars, too? D-doesn't everyone? Who's your favourite character? M-mine's Han Solo. Yeah, wait till you see what happens to him in the latest one. Latest what? So, Asteroids, I didn't know you played games. I mean, you seemed kind of good at it. I'm gonna b-beat the world record if it kills me. Why's it so important? I-I don't stammer when I play it. I should get back. My dad'll be going nuts. You just got here. Your dad sounds lame. You want one? Take it. I've got loads. I'm obsessed with these things. Dad. You want some gum? Dad? No, I don't. You sure? It's great. How many times, Vincent? No gum. Okay? Where did you get that? Corner shop. Limited re-release, apparently. Go on. I haven't had these since I was a kid. Used to drive me mum crazy sticking gum all over the house. Oh. Yes. Would you look at you. I need get on. For a minute there, I could've sworn I saw your dad smile. Nice work. We've been playing for hours. You'll have to take over soon. My hands are turning into claws. And look at your eyes. You look like the Emperor. Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. Mind if I get a drink? Go for it, Red. What did you just call me? That's your name from now on. Red for your Emperor eyes. I can't be him. I can't be. I don't want to talk about Red, Vinnie. It upsets your dad. Please. I have to know. How did it happen? Honestly, I don't... I don't know. I remember... I was going for a world record, too. 100 skips a minute. And then... I heard your dad shouting. Red! No! Come back, please! No, Red! No! And I remember this... weird sort of of light. Red! And then, it was gone. I asked him, but he never wanted to talk about it. The only time I saw him react was when he smashed up his games console. It's like a piece of him had broken and it never got fixed. Red? Red? I s-s-said is your dad gonna let you s-sleep over? No way. It's the only w-way we're gonna beat this record, man. W-what's his problem? He's kind of stubborn, like you. Hm. I like him already. You know, it's not something to be proud of. Never been a p-problem so far. Maybe if you just... talked for once, things wouldn't seem so bad. Your wife wouldn't leave and your family would stay together. What are you talking about? Wife? I'm never getting married. Are you g-gonna help me jump this thing or what? On your marks, g-get set... go! You go get it. I'll set this up again. No. You set it up last time. I'll do it. W-what does he love to do? Huh? Your dad. Maybe if you both do something that he likes doing, then he'll r-relax a bit. Then, you can g-get through to him, and then, you can sleep over. Yes. Um... Dad? Look, not right now, Vinnie... Vincent. Look what I just found. What did I just say? Auntie June said you never beat the world record. So, I thought maybe we could do it together. This is broken. It was. I fixed it. Vincent, it'll take hours to beat this record, days. That's what you're doing here, isn't it? Taking time. That's what Mum said. So, take it. Ooh. Still got it. Vincent. Vinnie, Vinnie. Look at the score. Look. 41,336,000... 350, yeah. Okay, just keep calm. Steady. Never get past this bit. I always get stuck. Then, we'll get through it... together. Come on. Steady. That's it. Come on. 42 million! 42 million! Yes! We did it! Yes! 42 million! 42 million! Yes! Where's it gone? It's outside. It's getting weaker. It's running out. AJ, breakfast. One, two, three, four... Red? I came to say thanks. What you said about my dad, it really worked. I haven't seen him that happy since... since forever. Cool. Come on in. Mum just made b-butterscotch angel delight. M-m-Mum, Red's here. It's today. 34... And I remember this weird sort of light. Red disappeared down that well. From then on, things just seemed to unravel for your dad. This is it. This is how I go down the well. But if I don't go down, I can't get home. I can't stay. I can't. Red? I can't let AJ see me disappear. You staying or you going? I can't do it to him. I can't. I'll never see home again. Red? Oh, is your dad going to be mad? If it helps, Mum said you could sleepover. Come on, then. It's back. Red, you coming or what? AJ... You're the best friend I ever had. Uh, okay, weirdo. I need to go. Cool, Red. Smell you later. Yeah, much later. I'm home. I knew there was something weird about this place. Mmm, smells good. Dad, you can cook? What are you talking about, Vinnie? I always do a roast on a Sunday. Who's the extra place for? Hey, love. Mum? Fate, the turn of events beyond a person's control, predetermined by a supernatural power. Is there really something out there guiding our every decision? Or are you shaping your own future?
