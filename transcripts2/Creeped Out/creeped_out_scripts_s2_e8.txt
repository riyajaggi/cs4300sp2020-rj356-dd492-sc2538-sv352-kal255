 The Curious. They say he collects strange tales. And if you ever hear his whistle, you know something creepy is about to unfold. You know that feeling when you just have to scratch an itch? What if that feeling just got worse and worse, and there was nothing you could do to make it stop? Very nice. Watch your balance. Excellent. Well done. Keep going, troops. Very good. Okay, we've got 30 seconds to go.

 Move it, loser-boy. Last thing now, just the tunnel left. Come on, Gabe! Last bit. Twenty seconds. Let's move it. - You first. I'm right behind you. - I... I can't. You just go. - Fifteen seconds. - Frankie, go! - Ten seconds, Sutherland. - It's only a tunnel. Don't throw it away at the end. Four... three... two... one. It's okay, soldier. It just wasn't your time.

 Sorry. Should have seen him yesterday. "Oh, the dark. I can't, I can't!" Typical "Cry-Gabey." What is your problem? Feel free to retrieve this at the end of the day, soldier. Talita? - Miss? - Lights. Now, before I go any further, the Head has instructed me to brief you all on some safety precautions. These... ...my follically-threatened friends, are head lice. Following our recent outbreak of the scalp-surfing critters, it is vital that you all re-absorb the rules, in order to halt another invasion. Be vigilant, people. Avoid head-to-head contact. And, yes, that does include selfies. Do not share hats. Use medicated shampoo. Remember, lice can travel at an alarming pace. And always, always check for eggs. These bloodsuckers can lay literally hundreds at a time. It's us against them, folks. So let's get smart. Not eaten. Right, that's the fire alarm. Lucky for us, it's not a sprinkler test. Okay, you know the drill. Fall out! It's just a drill! Let's get back to your classes! No door. Go back to your lessons, please. I've got the shampoo. Is he okay? Need any help? He won't stop scratching! You didn't hear that? Hear what? Yeah, definitely. Okay, we'll see you later. That was your mum. Tour's been delayed again. Sorry, kiddo. She's not gonna make the awards on Friday. What a shame. Miss me not collecting my certificate. Hey, there's always next time, mate. I made you this. It says for the bestest big brother. That's your name. That's great, Georgie. Hey, check this out. Awesome. Heat vision. Dad found it online. Early birthday present. Whoa, freaky. Right then, mister. Exploration time. Not the lice comb. I thought you obliterated them all last time. You never know with this tasty scalp. Your brother seems to attract more lice than a... A what? - A war. - Darn thing's stuck. A war. A war... A war. A war, a war, a war... A war, a war, a war... It just snapped. Let's get some shampoo. Kill off any eggs. Agh! It's all dripped out in the bag! Should be enough for this time, but we'll have to stock up. Ugh. Almost as if someone's jabbed a load of pin holes in it. Looks more like bite marks. Hey, Gabe. All right, Mr. Sutherland? What's going down, George my man? How's your grandma doing, hon'? Yeah, she's on the mend. Still not great. What are you guys after? Not lice shampoo, I hope? Mr. Romero reckons he found them like this. Some idiot stuck holes in all of them. Entire stock ruined. Maybe it's a malfunction with the bottle or something. - I'll see if they've got anymore out back. - Already asked. Next delivery won't hit the island for at least a week. A war. Well, best pray we don't have another outbreak in the meantime. A war, a war, a war... Gabe? - A war, a war... - Gabe! Hey! Space cadet. Welcome. Hello, welcome. Come through. Hey, Ridley. Good girl. Aw, look, Scaredy Cat stroking a scaredy cat. Any reason why you're being even more of an idiot tonight? We're a team, okay? If someone isn't pulling their weight, it's an insult to all of us. Nice attitude. Wonder where you heard that. - Your dad, maybe? - Frankie. It's starting. ...which brings me to our final award of the evening. These cadets that are sat before you fill me with pride every single day. And regardless of what it says on a piece of paper, they should all be very proud of what they have achieved. Very proud. And so, ladies and gentlemen, without further ado, I am delighted to introduce to you all... Gabe, you okay? A war. - "A war"? - A war. A war, a war, a war... A war, a war, a war... A war, a war, a war... A-ward, a-ward, a-ward... Not "a war." It's saying "award." Awards. Everybody, get out now! Gabe. Are you okay? Get off! Get off me! - What...? What's happening? - It's the lice. The lice? What do you mean, the lice? - They're taking over! - What's wrong with them? Should we help them? - Dad, Georgie! - Gabe? Please exit the stage as quickly as you can! Go! You guys see their faces? Like the itching had taken over. I don't wanna hear any more about killer head lice. Well, what's your explanation then, genius? I don't have one. All I know is a stupid bug isn't capable of that. Not one bug. Thousands. Is Dad gonna be okay? He'll be fine. As soon as we get help. Right, Gabe? They're coming this way. We're too exposed here. We need a base. Come in here. We need to secure the area. Help me with this. - Someone phone for assistance. - I left my phone in the hall. - Me, too. - I'm on it. My grandma's not answering. You think this is happening out there, too? Forget this. Come on. Emergency services. Which service do you require? Police. We're at Kastle Rock High School. Something weird's going on, and... Okay, let me take... ow! - What is that? Ow! - Hello? - Ah, another! - Hello? - Ow! Agh! - Hello? Gabe, back there in the hall, you knew what was happening. How? It's, uh... it's gonna sound crazy, okay? - I heard them. The lice. - What? First at my house. Then in the chemist's, then in the hall. It's like they've been planning all of this. - To attack the school? - I don't know why. But first they destroy all the bottles of shampoo on the island, and then they... What? I think I know what they want. We need to go. C-Come with me. Come away from the phone. What's that noise? The lice getting into the phone, breaking the circuits. - No, you can't do...! - We need it! Ah! Guys, guys. They're getting in. Run. Run! Training's over! - We need to go! - Where? Follow me. - Okay, no lice. We're clear. - Why are we in the nurse's room? It's why they're here. They've... they've come for these. - Special shampoo. - Last two bottles on the island. Once these are gone, there's nothing to stop them. Cool hat. Don't! Don't touch anything! We've gotta get these somewhere safe. How about the science lab? I mean, it's not that far. Maybe we can seal off the doors and windows using... this, and then, using Georgie's tablet, we can call for help. Fine, but if these are so important, I'm carrying them. - No, hey! Give it... - Guys, chill! And the Cry-Gabey fails again! That wasn't me! You were the one who just... Gabe? Gabe... - Gabe? - Gabe, Gabe... - We've gotta go. - Why? - Gabe... - I can hear them. Georgie, watch out! - Let's go! - Oh, no! Gabe, get Georgie out of here, now! - Come on! - Just go, now! - F-Frankie! - Go! They're coming for the shampoo! Go! It's working. They can't get in. No signal. We're trapped. What about that? Yeah. Yeah, if someone could maybe squeeze through and reach the exit with the shampoo, they might be able to bring help. Rocky? I can't go out there. Their teeth, the biting. They crawl all over you. They get in everywhere. I hate bugs. I hate them. Please. Don't make me go out there. You're safe in here, okay? What we gonna do? Shampoo. Come in, Georgie. You guys okay? Rupert that. Who's Rupert? You're meant to say "Roger." Roger's a mean kid in my class. Always steals my football stickers. So I'm saying "Rupert." Right, fine. How's Rocky doing? Gave her some of my emergency sweet stash. She's okay. Good boy, Georgie. That always makes me feel bet... Gabe? - Gabe, what is it? - Georgie... They're in here. They're in the vent. Oh, no. Georgie... Georgie, they're in here. They're... I can't keep going, Georgie. I can't breathe. Gabe, you can do this. You can! You're the bestest big brother ever. I believe in you, Gabe. You can do this. I know you can. Go! Go! Okay. Okay. Okay... Gabe? Gabe? Gabe? Gabe? I'm out. I made it. Yes! I can see the exit. Just stay there, okay? I... I'll bring help. - And Georgie...? - Yeah? Thanks. Gotta move, guys. Rupert and out. I might have another secret stash in here somewhere. Why have you got that hat? I didn't steal it. Just borrowing. Gabe said not to touch anything. You don't know who's touched it. Could've had eggs in it, or... - Hey! - We can't take any chances. Not with... What's wrong? S-stay away from me, Georgie. I said get away! - Back soon, guys. Just don't... - Sorry, Gabe. - What? - You told me not to touch it, but... - Georgie, what's happened? - The hat. What's that noise? Rocky grabbed it. There was eggs. Georgie, stay away from her. You hear me? - Agh! - She's getting closer! I'm coming for you. Just stay away! Georgie, I've got an idea. Just hang on. Hurry! Georgie, there's lice, but they're not moving. Don't touch them. There might be eggs. Gabe? What's happening? - They're hatching, Georgie! - Gabe? Help! Gabe? They're on me! They're on me! I can feel them! Help! Agh! Ugh-hh! Help! Georgie... Georgie! Ah... We're okay! You did it, Gabe! They're dead! The lice are dead! Pest control checked the whole place twice. No prisoners. Enjoy your weekends. Get some R & R. Oh. Good job, soldier. You're a hero, Gabe. Hardly. What is it? I can still hear their screams. They were only doing the same as us. Trying to survive. Come on. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge... Revenge. Revenge. Revenge. Revenge, revenge, revenge... - What? - Revenge, revenge... Gabe. - Revenge. - Gabe, you okay? Revenge, revenge, revenge... Revenge, revenge, revenge... Revenge, revenge, revenge... Don't forget to check those cupboards, and make sure there's shampoo, because you never know when lice might attack. And you won't see them coming when they do.
