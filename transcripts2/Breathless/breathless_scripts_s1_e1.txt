 Nurse. Clamp, please. I didn't mean throw the thing at me, Nurse. Not like it is in the damn manual. I'm worried about Miss Mulligan's blood pressure, Dr Truscott. I'm nearly there. (WATER RUNNING) Mr Powell, I wonder if Dr Truscott might have your opinion. Damn! Everything all right, Dr Truscott? You mind if I have a look, old man?

 The patient's in her early 20s. Presented with lower abdominal pain. Ovarian cyst. I think we might be better off with a Spencer Wells. Thank you, nurse. All right. Just let me come in here. (SNIP) That should do it. There we are. Righto. Ah, yes. Exactly what I was about to do. Thank you, theatre. (LAUGHTER) No more, "Yes, Doctor." "Thank you, Doctor," from me. No more bedpans! Ladies! (FOOTSTEPS) Congratulations, Mrs Richard Truscott.

 (CHEERING) Jean's getting married! Scuse me! Oh! Sorry! (AMBULANCE BELL RINGS) That's great. (LAUGHS) Right. Stebbings, you're first. In you go. (WOMAN GASPS) Feel that? (PHONE RINGS) You're not one of our usual miscreants. You are? Wilson. Staff. I transferred. QAH, Portsmouth. Why? Family, ma'am. You'll find London full of temptations and this hospital is no exception. I'm used to resisting temptation. Try not to make a fool of yourself. Miss Mulligan, from theatre this morning. So...how are we this afternoon, young lady? The doctor asked you a question, child. Well, she certainly presents with a distinct absence of joy, gentlemen. (LAUGHTER) Mind if we have a look at our handiwork? Sister...if you please. The moment I clapped eyes on her, I'm pretty certain I'm looking at an ovarian teratoma. Right as rain. Next time we meet, I hope we'll be delivering your first baby. Jolly good. Right. Who's next, Sister? Or is it time for coffee? Just Mrs Harcourt, Dr Truscott. Looking much brighter, I would say. Oh, yes. Hello, Mrs Harcourt. Hello, Doctor. Can I have a look at you? NEWSPAPER SELLER: Standard! Madam. Truscott. (LOW CHATTER) I'm really not sure about her. Where's Nurse Meecher? Oh. Jean sent me, sir. This requires the utmost discretion. You do understand that, don't you? (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Don't look so worried, Nurse. Dr Enderbury, please. What are we doing here? WOMAN: Otto? Is that you? I've been such a silly muffin. Why don't you take a seat? So when do you think you conceived? (SLOW JAZZ) If madam would care to wait over there? (JAZZ TEMPO INCREASES) Darling! My last day in that ghastly uniform and you show up weeks late. You are a very naughty boy. This is my fiancee. If you must know, I was held up in theatre. Not the bar, sir? Operating theatre. (PULSING HISSING) (MELLOW JAZZ) Well, this is lovely. You did your best with that girl, Ricky. We all thought so. Bloody Powell stepping in like that, made me look a right charlie. Oh, come on. Let's dance the night away. Tell the boys to give it some life. (CUBAN BEAT) ♪ Quizas, Quizas, Quizas (Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps) (BIRDSONG) This is for you. She's going. Hasn't taken the money. Where on earth did you find her? (HORN BLASTS) (STEAM TRAIN PASSES BY) (TAP DRIPPING) Jeannie? Oh, Christ! I'm late for the 6.26. All right, Dad. All right. I...can always change at London Bridge. Um... Ange. Jeannie, I don't want to be late! It's gone 7.30. There'll be hell to pay. There's Dad's pot to do. You'll be late. You should have sodding well told me it was an abortion, Jean! I would never have gone. Fetch the paper. That boy... All right, Dad. It's an outrage! All right. Why don't you sit yourself down? It's a bloody... I'm glad you came back, Ange. All right, Dad. That was wrong of you, Jeannie! It's illegal, for starters. (MIMICS GUNFIRE) (HORN TOOTS) Daddy! Mummy! Mummy! Mrs J, Daddy's home! Breakfast first, young man. Daddy! Good morning, Master Powell. Daddy! What? (WHISPERS) It's my birthday. It isn't, is it? Really? What is the date? No... I am sure you are mistaken. (LAUGHS) But it is my birthday. No, I'm sure that's not right. (CLOCK CHIMING) Happy birthday, Thomas darling. Cake for breakfast? What's the world coming to? Certainly not on a school day. I wanted Mr Powell to be here. And he won't be home for tea, will you? I chose this one. There you are. You really should have told me. You wouldn't have gone. I do not want to end up in Holloway. You wouldn't get £5 for any other private procedure. I didn't take the money. What is it about you, Ange? You skedaddle down to Plymouth... Portsmouth! And I came back, if you remember, to fend for Dad, so you could get married. Wedding ring. Oh, shoot. Still nothing from Joe? Oh, Ange. But you are going to be happy. And I'm coming to that church. Me, Dad and half the street. You are sodding not. I'm late. It's for the best, Ange. Honestly. They can't know about Dad, not like he is. Richard would run a mile. I know. Well, it's the early bird. You work so hard, darling. This morning, Mrs Enderbury, I am on a mission. MAN: Goodbye, darling. WOMAN: Have a lovely day. See you later. Goodbye. (HORN TOOTS) I can hardly believe he's eight already. Yes. Every parent must feel that way, I'm sure. But we are different. It was the best way, Elizabeth. Yes. Yes, I know. I worry you're going to exhaust yourself, Otto. Well, Mrs J's coffee keeps me alive... ..if it doesn't actually kill me first. Ooh. I uh... I shall be late tonight. I hate that thing. Just insurance. Best be prepared. (BUS BELL DINGS) Your fiance has more money than sense. Well, I wonder if this NHS of theirs runs to vases. (PHONE RINGS) You uh...gave me a fright, Maureen. Getting ill like that. I'm sorry. All uh... ..ship-shape, you know? I'd be having a word with your father if not, dear. She can be such a silly thing. Father's not a flower man, is he, Mo? Says, "All that money going to waste after a few days." But then a police inspector's salary is hardly paid in bullion. The next thing I knew, a fireman was pulling me from the wreckage. My sister, my father, dear Ma - gone. Like that. Thank you very much, Mr Hitler. A V-2? Really? The whole street gone. So...who took you in? Well, I was evacuated to darkest Somerset. The people had a pub in Crewkerne. So are they coming? To your wedding, silly. Leave the poor girl alone, Lily dearest. Crewkerne is a frightful way away, isn't it? But what about friends? Who is coming? You are. You're my friends. And the other nurses. Now, ladies, I have booked a table for some lunch and time is... My treat, Lily dearest. You do look completely ravishing. Well, it's all thanks to you and Mr Powell. That'll be last night's dinner. Richard really went to town. Please don't think badly of me. I knew something fishy was going on. You won't be the first nurse to go up the aisle expecting. He said he'd be careful. He's a gynaecologist. That hardly makes him an expert! Lily, that really is too much. Silly me. I think I'm just happy for you. Mrs Powell, I'm so sorry. But does Richard actually know? Jean? Why else do you think he's marrying me? Nurse Wilson. Sir. You've been warned to be cautious around doctors. Mr Powell, whatever you may think, what I found myself involved in last night was illegal - Forget it. It never happened. That patient had made a mistake. I can help. The law - Makes miserable lives and miserable women. Whoever they are. As easy as that? I didn't say it was easy, but it's what I believe. Look, at least take the money you earned. Dr Enderbury's never at his best agitated. Good afternoon, Mr Powell. Dearest, we are very early. Well, it's the early bird... Mission - by the way - accomplished! Gosh, darling, can we really afford it? (DOOR BELL) You're the tops, Mrs Enderbury. We are from Scotland Yard and we are... arresting you! Ta-da! The house does look lovely, Mrs J. Lily dear. Elizabeth. Mummy, look what Uncle Charles gave me! It's a Scalextric set. When a chap is eight, it is what every chap has to have. (ALL LAUGH) Remember, not a word about Jean. Oh, I'm not at all good at lying. Yahoo! Charlie's a grown man. He's a wonderful godfather. And you're a saint, throwing a do for Richard and Jean. But you are a saint, aren't you? I rather doubt it. Honestly. (BELL CLANGS) Well, there is, I'm happy to report, nothing amiss with Mrs Baring. You see, darling, as I said, it's just a matter of time. Your wife is virgo intacta. Super! The National Health Service... ..for the newly wed. (POP MUSIC AND LAUGHTER) ♪ She comes on like a rose ♪ But everybody knows ♪ She'll get you in Dutch ♪ You can look but you'd better not touch... ♪ Bed, dearest. Now. Why, Mummy? School tomorrow, for starters. And, for seconds, some things are for grown ups. Come on, Thomas. Let's have no shilly-shallying. He's shooting up. Am I making an absolute nit of myself? Not at all. It's marvellous. Oh. ♪ Poison Ivy ♪ Poison Ivy ♪ Late at night while you're sleepin' Poison Ivy comes a creepin'... ♪ So did you speak to Sister about Thursday? Yeah. Hello. Again. Uh, can I er... ..give you a lift? I'm happy on the bus, thank you. Bugger this. Uh, look, there's a Lyons Corner House at Baker Street. We wouldn't be breaking any laws having tea, would we? Or a drink? I don't. Me neither. So...back to Plan A. For one thing, you're married and - Maybe you're a married woman. Or at least an engaged one. Happily? My happiness has nothing to do with you. All right. We've got off on the wrong foot. Again. I'm just trying to do the right thing and stay out of any more trouble. Trouble chooses. It's not the other way round. In my experience. (LIVELY MUSIC AND CHATTER) Mrs J. Darling! Sorry. Sorry. My list today was never-ending. Oh. I'm sure all your ladies will be most grateful. Very nice to see you. Right - again. On your marks. Get set. That's cheating! (LAUGHS) Are you being beastly to my husband, Dr Truscott? Of course I am. It's a crime you left the NHS, Mrs Enderbury. You used to look an absolute fox in that uniform. (THEY CHUCKLE) Oh, come and dance with me, Charlie darling. Darling. Oh. Lily, dearest. I'm absolutely okey-dokey. Well, I for one - quite probably alone - am getting another drink. I'll sit down. I'll get you some water. Miss Mulligan. What on earth are you doing here? You should be in hospital. Where are you going? You just had a serious operation. No, I'm... I'm all right. (BELL DINGS) I'm calling for an ambulance. No, no. I can't go ahead... With this wedding, Nurse. You're supposed to love your husband, aren't you? Aren't you? Richard. We all know there isn't a chap that doesn't envy you bagging the delicious Jean. And, Jean. I can only say Elizabeth and I are honoured to be giving you away. To Saturday, ladies and gentlemen. To doctors and nurses. (LAUGHTER) To marriage. ALL: To marriage. That was a very tricky procedure yesterday. Yes, and you made me look a right charlie, boss. No time for business, gentlemen. We are so lucky. That's right. Not entirely sure what we'd all do without Mr and Mrs Powell. Cheerio. I'm sorry. He's a bit... That new girl. The one you palmed us off with. What do you know about her? Why? Is she all right? Oh, yes. Excellent. Not a patch on you, Jean. You'll be wasted in the kitchen. Don't go. Please? Sister? Five minutes? You need to get some sleep. Charlie. You gave Thomas a Scalextric. Bought it as much for me, I think. That nurse yesterday, for the procedure. Did you have a word? Mm-hm. I suppose I'm a bit jumpy about tomorrow. I don't know what it'll be like, striking out on my own. £3,000 a year will certainly oil the wheels, won't it? You give us what for at the Board tomorrow morning... and you'll have the Chair of Anaesthetics before you know it. I need this job, Otto. I really do. You'll be there tomorrow? Charlie... You're always so sure things will work out, aren't you? Because they do. For you, Otto. And you, old man. Plain sailing. If no-one rocks the boat. Boss, Mrs Boss... really super do. Can't thank you enough. (THEY LAUGH) Oh, come on, Jeannie. Let's get you home. Let's hope the roads are empty. God, I hope they don't end up wrapped around a lamp post. I'm going up. Good night. Good night, one and all. Oh, you go up, too, Mrs Powell. I'll finish up here. Mrs Powell? Really, it's quite all right. Oh, and thank you, Mrs J. JEAN: I know it's silly but... Mm? I'm quite nervous about Saturday. Hm. Well, then don't be. Come on. Let's go up to your room. The house is full of nurses. You'll get distracted. An atom bomb couldn't distract me. Anyway, what's so secret in there? I'm worried it will harm baby. Trust me. I'm a doctor. Darling, you do... What, nurse? ..love me? I'm marrying you, aren't I? Of course I do. I love every...tiny... ..inch of you. Now run along, before I take the law into my own hands. Go on. (DOOR OPENS) Jeannie? Jeannie, what on earth's the matter? All I wanted, for years, was to be married. To get away from here. Well, on Saturday... Have you ever wanted something so much you forget to think about where it might end up? No, you're too level-headed for that. I ran away and married Joe. A sailor, for God's sake. I do love Richard. Oh, Jeannie. You are going to be happy. It's just nerves, I'm sure. We should get some sleep. Do you think Richard would go through with this if he saw Dad for half a second? I'm pooped. Ange, I'd love you at the wedding. Honestly. But I couldn't keep all this up if you were. When Mum died, I decided... ..I'm not gonna get left behind. Nurse Wilson, a word, please. That Nurse - Wilson - has just been called into Vosper's office. And? Lovely morning! Are you all right? You look like you've seen a ghost? Otto! Otto, could I have a word? Sister tells me that you rescued a young woman who'd discharged herself and then spent half the night on the ward, calming her down. Well done. Thank you, ma'am. You won't survive a week here if you worry about every unhappy woman. Our job is to change dressings and to fulfil prescriptions. Don't go getting delusions about changing people's lives, Nurse Wilson. You may go. Thank you, Matron. Prolapse, gentlemen, and its grisly consequences. Nine little Brownes. Time to say no, Mrs Browne, or is Mr Browne simply too persuasive? Come on in, folks. Everybody gather round. Righto, let's have a look, shall we? It's not for the faint-hearted, I warn you. Maureen? Miss Mulligan? (SOBS) Maureen? What are you doing in there? I'm all right. Sister's gonna have your guts for garters, Wilson. Have you got a ha'penny? What? Have you gone mad? OK. Shh, shh, shh. It's OK. Come on. No, I can't. I can't. Shh. I can't go through with the wedding. Please, please. Please just tell him I'm sorry. What do you mean? They're coming here today, to take me away. Just because I'm better. Who is? My mother and my father. I can't. I can't, I can't, I can't. Right... Can you tell Sister you couldn't find me? That way, I'll get it in the neck and not you. Mm-hm. And you, Maureen, you go straight back to bed. Gonna sort this out once and for all. OK? You take over. Very good. Gold star for observation, Symonds. Excuse me. Am I at the right place for the Board? Oh. Mehta. How do you do? Enderbury. Sorry, uh... You are... You are...? Oh, I'm just a humble candidate for the Chair of Anaesthetics. Are you on the panel? Uh, no. No. Always jumping to conclusions. (LAUGHS) Yeah. Dr Enderbury, please. Mr Powell. Mr Powell, I've been looking... I need you. Dr Enderbury. Well, I'm supposed to be grilling these gentlemen. Mr Powell, Maureen Mulligan - the ovarian cyst. She's being transferred to a private nursing home today. I'm worried that she'll harm herself. The psychiatry department is that way. Now, if you'll excuse me, I do need to appoint a new Chair of Anaesthetics. Mr Powell... What I witnessed you doing, if I went to the authorities, the police... (LAUGHS) Why are you laughing, Mr Powell. Come along. Let's see what we can do, shall we? After you. Well, you can dry your eyes, young lady, because I am happy to see you moved today. Thank you so much for sending Nurse Wilson to fetch me. Do you mind? Dr Truscott, gentlemen, good morning. Miss Mulligan. Do you mind, old man? Let's have a look, shall we? Sister, I don't want Miss Mulligan moved anywhere for at least...48 hours. Yes, Mr Powell. Miss Mulligan is my patient, Mr Powell. She's perfectly fit to be moved. Not in my opinion. Sister? Miss Mulligan can be transferred to a nursing home. She's fit for that. Will you excuse me? For crying out loud! SISTER: Dr Truscott, please. Ronald, dear. Oh. The incomparable Nurse Wilson. Were you laughing at me? You were absolutely terrifying. Well, thank you for what you did. I certainly infuriated Dr Truscott, which in itself was worth the price of admission. I wonder if you might reconsider my invitation to tea. Nurse, please. Look, I'm obviously too left-handed at this sort of thing, but... You doctors have a frightful reputation. I'm already in enough trouble without being late back on the ward. Did you knock them for six? Where were you? Dr Mehta, please. It was nice to have met you all. Good show. And you. I'm sure you did your best, old man. (THOMAS MIMICS AEROPLANE) (THOMAS MIMICS GUNFIRE) (STEAM TRAIN PASSING BY) ANGE: You'll be safe here. What will happen when my father finds out I'm missing? We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. You can't marry a man you don't love. Now, you need to get some rest. Have... Have you ever thought of getting married? I am married. But...Joe disappeared. So now I'm here, keeping Dad out of embarrassing himself and... Now, you need to drink your tea and get some rest. Shall I take it? Careful with the veil. (PHONE RINGS) OTTO: You have to wait for me. The Powell residence. It's uh...Dr Enderbury, Mr Powell. Righto. I'll be right back. Excuse me, Mrs J. Charlie. You let me down. Oh, relax. Please. You owe me! Look, it's probably for the best. What, that Mehta got the job? Charlie...this is not the time. Remember Cyprus, Otto. Otto? Elizabeth helped me buy it. With you getting promoted, I thought we could afford it. Whatever's the matter? You look wonderful. Mummy, did you have a dress like that when you married Daddy? (JEAN GROANS) Thomas, dear. Please will you check the cars are here? Oh! Now, darling. Please. Oh! I'll fetch Otto. (GROANS) (BELLS PEALING) Mother dearest! Richard. Well... (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) OTTO: It's gone, I'm afraid, Jean. We need to get you to a hospital, do a D&C.; I'll call an ambulance. I'm so sorry. Otto. I want to go ahead...with the wedding. You should be in a hospital. Mr Powell, please. I have to. It's out of the question. I'll never have a chance like this again. Please, Mr Powell. Elizabeth? Do it, Otto. Help her. Jeannie? Jeannie! Jeannie's gone. And I need your help. (KNOCKS GENTLY) Mo. It's all right. Dad, this is Mo. I'll be back in a little while. Will you show Mo the ropes, OK? Where are you going? To see Jeannie, Dad. But Mo's not feeling 100%. Can you look after her for me? So... Divide and conquer. (BELLS PEALING) You can do this, Jeannie. Thank you, Otto. You... are a remarkable woman. Do you, Richard Arnold Truscott, take this woman to be your lawfully-wedded wife, to have and to hold in sickness and in health, for as long as you both may live? RICHARD: I do. The nurse. Yes, she said she wanted nothing to do with money. What do you mean? She was there. She helped. Mr Powell... I have never felt like this. You must find you your own department. Mm? You do think things through in a clever way. You still love me, don't you, Ricky. You should stop by for a martini sometime. You know how I make them. Leave me alone or I will use this.
