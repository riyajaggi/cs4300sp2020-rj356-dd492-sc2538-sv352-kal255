 Breathless (2013): Season 1, Episode 5 - Episode #1.5 - full transcript 
 Margaret is admitted to the hospital with cervical cancer and, despite Otto performing a hysterectomy, dies. Otto suspects Richard's involvement with her and Margaret offers Jean words of domestic wisdom before her operation. Jean, confused and upset, visits Monty for reassurance but he is also wandering and attempts to drown himself, being rescued by Otto, who discovers that Angela and Jean are sisters but agrees to say nothing. Angela, seeing the Powells as a happy family on a theatre trip, becomes even more aware that an affair with Otto would be pointless whilst Elizabeth realizes that Mulligan has duped her into having sex and there are no saving documents as promised. He tells her how Otto failed to save his son in Cyprus where he first became smitten by Elizabeth, with whom he is now obsessed. Lily sees her with Mulligan but Elizabeth asks her not to tell their husbands though Lily has her own disappointment when Charlie tells her he has failed an interview for a better job in St. Albans.

 All I want to do is stop feeling what I'm feeling but I can't. And I do not know what to do any more. I just want to be near you, nothing more. What happens here has got nothing to do with love, all right? Go back to wherever it is you go. Keep doing whatever you're doing. I love you but I can't live without... love. It's that serious? The tests, the biopsy, should tell me more. I don't want to hurt you. Let me have the statements and the photographs. But I'll lose you if I give them to you. Please!

 So, here we have Hades seizing the beautiful young Persephone, dragging her down to the realm of the dead. Some of you may be familiar with the celebrated Bernini sculpture, which depicts the same rape, although it predates this by some 80 years. Sorry. No, no, it's fine. It's only just begun. Hope I don't get told off. What fun! We mustn't be too harsh on fierce old Hades. After all, he did make an honest woman of her. She became Queen of the Underworld. Can I get your bags? No, no, no. I'm stronger than I look. Ma'am.

 In here, Mr Powell. So... when do you cut me open? First thing tomorrow. Splendid. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. The aviary, which was designed by an unknown architect, was finally completed in 1889. Far too hot to hurry. Whenever the Baron was in residence, he used to come here to feed the birds. We're told the birds actually recognised his voice. We'll just step in here. Mrs Powell. What a surprise. Mr Mulligan. Mrs Enderbury. Mrs Enderbury? Oh. Enchanted. Marvellous, isn't it? Do you think the birds are happy? I'd say they are. They're singing, anyway. Are you interested in gardening, Mr Mulligan? Silly question. You must be, or you wouldn't be here. Oh, hold on tight, we're moving. You go ahead, Lily. I just want a private word with Mr Mulligan. What are you doing here? We got off on the wrong foot. You promised me the files. You forced me to let you... do what you did. And then didn't keep your word. I'm not proud of that. The lie or the rape? Please. It wasn't that, don't call it that. Please. I'm here to ask you... to beg you, to put all that behind us. So we can start again. There are no files. You had nothing. Very pleased to meet your friend. Mrs Charles Enderbury. Your husband's accomplice? He seemed um... very nice... your mysterious man. Shut up. Sorry. Lily, please, really, it's so important. You mustn't mention him to anyone. Not Otto, not Charlie. All right. Especially not Charlie. Do you promise? Good. Thank you. We need never refer to it again. Right. Better catch up with the tour. Stifling today. Yes, isn't it? I'd kill for an ice. You'll be wearing a bikini in no time. Right, chaps, on we go. Dr Truscott? Quick word? Stand easy, chaps. Thought I should let you know. Margaret Dalton's here, in a private room. What? Margaret came to see me last week. Abdominal pain, loss of appetite... some bleeding after sex. You weren't aware of that? You examined her? And sent a smear to the lab. She has cervical cancer. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. No, don't be ridiculous. I barely know her. I'm operating tomorrow. Right, well, if it's just the cervix, we can whip it out in a trice. If it's spread, hysterectomy. Yes, we'll see. Mind if I come along for the ride? Not at all. Excellent. Fancy meeting you here. Yes. A doctor in a hospital. Bizarre. I phoned you last week a couple of times, called round at the flat... I've been rather incommunicado. Sorry. No. No, understood. So, er... Powell been treating you all right? Mm. Conceited bastard. Thinks he's the best gynae surgeon in London. But I'll let you into a little secret. He is. Well, aren't I the lucky one, landing on my feet? Mehta will cover for me tomorrow, I've got an appointment. Fine. No, it's about another job. At St Albans - head of department. Oh, terrific. Yes. Sorry to spring it on you. They got in touch last week... wanted a reference. You didn't mention it. You didn't mention it. No. I'm worried about leaving you in the lurch. No, don't, old chap. I can always get someone else. What about the Specials? Yes, those too. Honestly, Charlie. It's your life, your career. Please. Pursue it. Now buzz off. Thanks, old man. Oh... Best of bloody luck. How did Oliver's father die? I don't remember in the book. They may tell us in the show. Madam. Oh, thank you. They're beautiful! Shall I put them in water? Throw them away. Please. I shouldn't like to be an orphan. Well, you won't be one. We'll need to hurry if we're meeting Daddy. Before you go, Nurse, could you fetch Mrs Baker's notes? Nurse? Nurse! I... I've been thinking. We should... We should. Just talk or... Let's get out of here. Thank you, ma'am. Daddy! Elizabeth. This is Nurse Wilson, Mrs Powell. And our son, Thomas. Pleased to meet you. Likewise. We're going to see Oliver at the theatre. Hope you enjoy it. Thank you. Are you excited? Me too. Are you getting up? Sorry. Can't sleep. Me neither. What's the problem? Nothing. Nothing, nothing at all. Don't want to bore you with it. Who's that? It's me, Dad. Hello, Jean. Just been up reading in my bedroom. You just carry on, Mo. Jeannie. What are you standing there for, like a lemon? Come and sit down. I'm not a lemon. Sit yourself down. Your sister's at work at the hospital. You seem well today, Dad. I'm always well. Always well. And you? Yeah. I'm fine. Cup of tea? Did you ever... love anyone else... apart from Mum? No. Always her. From the first dance. You were lucky. And so was she. And you will be too. Don't you worry. I'll walk you down the aisle. You don't mind me coming, do you? I don't want to cramp your style. You look... terrific. Charlie, the neighbours! - Damn the neighbours. - Charlie! It's like we're on an adventure. Sorry, you can't eat or drink. Got a light? See you on the other side. Old friends. First incision. Dr Mehta? Please proceed. I am a cumbersome stand-in for Dr Enderbury. Not at all. A trusty lieutenant. I imagine you barely need to speak, just a nod and a wink. Thick as thieves. Indeed. And where was your alliance forged? Army Medical Corps. Do you mind awfully if we don't chat? Not at all. I wouldn't want to unsettle you. No? Of course not. Perish the thought. Dr Enderbury? Watson. Welcome. Pleasure. Slight change of plan, Mr Soames is tied up in emergency surgery - unexpected complications. Ah, the old UC. Unexpected complications. Ah, yes. So, let me give you a tour of the ship, and after you've had a break for lunch, could we reconvene here at two? Fine. Thank you. Mr Soames is eager to meet you. We've seldom seen such glowing references. Can't believe everything you hear. They said you were modest. Not that modest. Let's go and look at it. Carcinoma widespread - pelvis, glands. Jesus Christ. We can take out the ovaries, the cervix and uterus. But the cancer's rampant. We can't cut it all out. We have... We have to try. No, we don't. Because, I repeat, it's not possible. If you won't, I will. I beg your pardon? She'll die if I don't. She'll die now if you do. She's my patient, Mr Truscott. I can't allow you to kill her. Lovely day. She'll be conscious in a minute. Someone has to tell her. Not sure I'm up to that. You are. You will be. How are you feeling? Bit woozy. Too many G&Ts.; So, everything OK? There's noth... There's nothing we can do. You must have known six months ago, some pain... which you ignored, because you're so... independent, so... so flawless. I should have noticed, I should have seen but I could... I couldn't, because I could never imagine anything wrong with you. I'm very grateful for that. Please don't blame yourself. Come here. Come here. Come. How long have I got? Months? Weeks? Maybe. Guess who? Charlie! The surgeon was in theatre. Got to be back in an hour. It's such a lovely town, Charlie. I saw a darling little house for sale. It's all there for the taking. So, what can we do with an hour? Gosh! S-M-I-T-H. No luggage. Come on, Mrs Smith, we haven't got all day. Not a bad little boat, is she? Could've done a job at Dunkirk. Is this what you've brought me to see? This is where I've kept them in recent weeks. Kept what? The files. Take a peek. You know whose it is, don't you? And where I found it. The dead man's blood-stained shoe. Proof, if proof were needed, to convict both Powell and Enderbury. No, keep it, feel free. A reminder. There's more here - photos, statements, et cetera. You're not seeing her at her best. We used to keep her spick and span. He'd help me, Stewart would. My son. How old was he? Nine. He was upriver in this boat in a lock. He liked the locks... water pouring in, lifting us slowly up. My wife and daughter were in the cabin making sandwiches, I was chatting to the lock-keeper. I heard Stewart laughing. He called, 'Dad, Dad!' I thought he must've seen something. But you don't interrupt your father. You don't interrupt your father when he's talking, do you? Do you? Stop it, Ronald, stop it. I didn't hear him go in. He drowned? He drowned. We let the water out of the lock and found him. One moment you're laughing... the next you disappear. And my heart stopped... until I saw you again. Again? I haven't told you about the first time. It was a baking day, the Cypriot sun beating down. I came into the cool dark of a convent hospital. A bare room... like a chapel. Light from a high window. And a bed. And in that bed, a woman lay, unconscious. I looked at her... and I could hardly breathe. It was as if the light, somehow, was shining from her. You were the most beautiful sight I'd ever seen. You still are. You should think about your wife... your daughter. No. I just want you. You and Thomas. You can't have Thomas! You may have had me but you can never have Thomas. Never. I don't want to use it, Elizabeth. Then restore some honour, Inspector, and don't. Would you deign to come and see La Dolce Vita, Friday? Never heard of it. Or another film, any film. Erm... I'll deign to. Thank you. God, my heart's started beating again. Cohen, you seem to have lost your fellow students. Yes, Mr Powell, just rejoining them now. I'm sorry about yesterday. I...I felt awful. So did I. Bad timing. Bad timing. Otto? Job for you. Private patient. Day shift. Here's her address. And who said I wanted a job? She's dying. Cervical cancer. Needs a nurse. I'm a housewife. No, you're not. Good night. Of course we'll miss you when we're gone but you must come and see us. And the cathedral. Did I say there was a cathedral? Oh. Well, fingers crossed. Mm. Must be so nice to go somewhere new where nobody knows you. Just take Thomas and start afresh. And Otto. Yes, of course. Thomas needs a father. I didn't mention the er... you know, your friend to Charlie or anyone. Good. North Wing One. Sister Neville speaking. Hold one moment. Nurse? Telephone. Hello? I phoned Jean but she's not there. He ran out of the house and I can't get him back. All right, Mo. He's in the park. I'm coming. Sorry, Sister, I need to go home. What's the problem? Gas leak. Gas? You wouldn't be lying to me, would you, young lady? Go on. Do what you have to do. Thank you. I'm getting the bus. My car will be quicker. But you'll be in it. Well, how about I don't talk? I'll just drive. Hello. I've come to take over. Ah... Jean? Are you... the patient? Sorry, Mr Powell didn't tell me your name. No, I'm her oldest friend. Go through, she's expecting you. I must look a fright. We've met before, haven't we? You're Margaret Dalton. You know Richard. I do. Look at you. You're a peach. Get away from me! Please, Mr Meecher. I'll drown you. You want drowning? I'm just trying to help you. I swam the Channel, I did. Twice a bloody day. - Oh, God. - Leave me alone! Get out of it! Mr Meecher! Can't you just... Get out of it! Mo? Oh, I'm so sorry. Go on. I'm just trying to enjoy myself. It's all right, Mo, not your fault. Dad! Get out of it! Dad! Come out, it's not safe! I'm not ready. Please! Not ready, not ready! Here. Hold this for me, will you? Hello. I thought I'd join you. Hope you don't mind? I'm a friend of your daughter's. It's nice and cool. It's OK. What's his address? Um...7 Drake Way. And your name is? Mulligan. Maureen. Here you go, Dad. Careful. What are you doing? You might want to poison me. If I wasn't already poisoned. You need morphia. I think I will have some of that morphine now. Thank you. My mother had cervical cancer. Died six years ago. I'm sorry. I nursed her at home. I've tried to... improve myself. To be alluring and demure. Capable, not-too-capable, interested, amusing... Not... weighed down by my background. I've tried to be perfect for him. How do you do it? Stop pretending to be somebody else. You want him to love you? To love you? Well, let him see you. Be yourself. Really, I thought the door was locked. It's all right, Mo. He can't be your responsibility. He's ours. It was very nice to meet you, sir. I'll never let him go again. You looking for a wife? No, Dad, he's... He's not. You should meet her sister - Jean. I'm glad to say that I've already had that pleasure. You're a very lucky man... to have two such exceptional daughters. After Mum died... Jean stayed here and cared for Dad for five years. She has a right to a different future. And a different past. In which she loses both parents and avoided the shame of a father of unsound mind. So be it. Her secret - and your secret - is safe with me. You won't tell Richard? I won't tell anyone. I should go back in. What are you doing here? Isn't it obvious? Come in. She's in the bedroom. You know where that is. No? Follow me. He's here. Hello. The night nurse will be here in an hour or so. So I'll go now. Leave you two together. This is madness. And who's responsible for it? Otto. No. You. And me. But how could he? Sending Jean here. So we could see each other, really see each other. All three of us. I'm glad. You should be glad too. Come on, take my hand. Please. I love your wife. And she loves you. Don't lose her. It's from St Albans. Shall I open it for you? No. Thank you. My responsibility. Oh, dear. Bad news, I'm afraid. No new start. Oh. Oh, well. Never mind. See you later. Chin up. You've been avoiding me these last few days. How is she? Jean or Margaret? Margaret. Eating nothing. Fading. But she's well cared for, I trust? You've got some nerve. You think we're all in your theatre and you can do whatever you want with us. So you don't want the best for her? There's no one better than Jean. Dr Truscott? Your wife's on the telephone. It's urgent. Got your satchel? I thought I might drive you. Morning, Thomas. Has the cat got your tongue? Good morning, sir. What a kind offer. I couldn't put you to so much trouble. But, please, come back at, say, one? We'll have lunch. Very good. Who was he? An old friend. Of the family. Now we mustn't mention him to Daddy, else it'll spoil the surprise. And there'll be special sweets for boys who can keep secrets. I wanted to thank you... for what you did the other day with my father. No, I was happy... more than happy. I need to ask you some questions. About you. About your marriage. Are you going to tell me you hate your wife? No. But she doesn't understand you? She understands me. Very well. But the... romance... The romance? Has died? No. It was never there. Ever. I have... never even kissed her. You have a son. Yes. We have a son. It doesn't make sense. It will. One day it will. If... you can just trust me. What are you hiding? I can't tell you. Then we can't go any further. We're close. Richard's here. Margaret? I'll leave you two alone. No. Stay. Please stay with me. Didn't get it. The job. So, sorry, chum, you're stuck with me. No, that's great for me. We're a good team. We are, aren't we? Ever since Cyprus. You in the driving seat. Depending on each other. Absolutely. Blood on our hands. Everything all right, Charlie? Everything's fine. Tickety-boo. No... Felt a bit dead out there, to be honest. Like there was nothing at stake. Whereas here... You're involved. Exactly. Mr Powell, telephone call for you. Otto, I need you to come home now. I knew you'd betray me. I knew. 'Come back at one.' I saw it in your eyes. What have you got to say for yourself? You can't. You can't... How could you? I bare my soul to you! And you turn to him. He's my husband. You think he can confront me: the man who has everything, who can do anything, and get away with it? No. No, he can't. You saw the evidence. You mention me, you breathe my name to him and his charmed life is over. And yours. And Thomas's. Does my love mean nothing? The undertakers are coming. Thank you. What's wrong? You're never here. Well, hang on, that's not entirely true. It is. Even if you are, you're not really. Of course I am. Not in your head. Not in your... heart. You're falling in love. Well, you can't. You know the rules. You're his father. I'm his father. The lie we live by. The lie we live by. I need you to keep your promise. To always protect him. And me. I will. You have power over everything but not me, understand? I want you. Otto Powell is a good but very complicated man. We're the same, you and me. What are you so frightened of? I am not going to prison. I will handle this. Did you kill someone, Charlie? You are no longer playing God. What does Mulligan want? I think he wants me. And to destroy you.
