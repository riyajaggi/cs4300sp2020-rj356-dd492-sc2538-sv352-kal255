 Breathless (2013): Season 1, Episode 2 - Episode #1.2 - full transcript 
 Charlie loses out on his promotion to Mehta whilst Richard, returning from honeymoon, is angry that Jean, with Otto's collusion, has kept her miscarriage secret and gone ahead with the wedding. At work he succumbs to the bullying Eric Smallwood, who is cheating on his depressed wife Valerie, by going along with Smallwood's suggestion that he gives Valerie tranquillizers, leading to Valerie threatening Eric's mistress. Jean, having been used to working, is not comfortable in her role as a housewife and yearns to return to nursing, even though married couples are not allowed to work together. To add strain to the new marriage Richard meets up with old flame Margaret. Otto finds himself attracted to Angela and comes to her house but she is not keen to get involved with a married man. Furthermore she is keeping it secret that she is Jean's sister, who has come from Portsmouth to look after their father Monty, whom Jean had told people had died in the war. Inspector Mulligan comes to the Powells' house to blackmail Elizabeth over her husband's actions in Cyprus nine years before.

 Otto? I've been such a silly muffin. What I found myself involved in last night was not only illegal... That patient had made a mistake, I can help. The law... Makes miserable lives and miserable women. Supposed to love your husband, aren't you? Richard. ALL: To marriage! My happiness has got absolutely nothing to do with it. Alright, we've got off on the wrong foot. You're the tops, Mrs Enderbury. You on the panel? Er, no. No.

 Always jumping to conclusions. Anyway what's so secret in that? You do...love me? Do you think Richard would go through with this if he saw Dad for half a second? I knew there was something fishy going on! You won't be the first nurse to go up the aisle expecting. I hate that thing. Best be prepared. What's gonna happen when my father finds out I've gone missing? (GASPS) I'll fetch Otto. It's gone I'm afraid, Jean. I'll never have a chance like this again. ♪ It's a wonderful world

 ♪ I'm just walkin' on air ♪ Talk of heaven on earth... Shut your eyes, Mrs Truscott. ♪ Haven't got a care ♪ Happy all day through... Now keep them shut. There's a good girl. Ooh! ♪ Loving wonderful you Your new home. Well, you have to open them if you want to see it, silly. Oh, gosh, it is super. Mm. Our own little love nest. (COUGHING) Mother wanted to uh... show you the flat. Nice honeymoon? We want to hear everything. Don't we, Arnold? Well, not quite everything. Like we agreed - think of Queen and country. I'd say it serves him right! You know... (LAUGHTER) ALL: Morning, Mr Powell, sir. Oh, bugger. We meet again. Good morning, Miss Roper. (COUGHS) Do you think Miss Roper might be more comfortable if she wasn't forced to inhale your Half and Half? It never crossed my mind, sir. No. Quite. OK, that's enough. All of you go. Now! And learn some manners or go to veterinary college. Now, would you mind awfully if I see how we got on? Good morning. Mrs Jenny Gilbert? Yes. At the end, on the right. Thank you. Darling, what on earth are you doing here? Eric, dearest. I came to see Jenny. How are you, Jenny? Oh, that's very sweet of you, Val. Mrs Gilbert and I were just plotting Fairways Ladies Day. I can't escape your husband, even in hospital, can I? I mean as Club Secretary. Well, I... I should probably... No, Eric, I think not. Well, you certainly don't look like someone who's just had surgery. Oh, didn't feel a thing. Now right as rain. Wonder of modern medicine. Mm. And Jean, dearest, would you look at this little chap? Well, he's certainly grown, hasn't he? Did you have to, Mother? Your father gave the interior designer carte blanche... except... Home. Do you remember it, Richard? We thought when a little one comes along... Mother...dearest... That might be sooner rather than later. Well, you never know, do you? Gosh. Well, that would be a lovely surprise - and so quickly, Richard. So... The honeymoon? Four glorious days. Richard didn't want to be away from his patients for too long. Did you, darling? I don't think we would, Mrs Truscott, say no to a cup of tea. OK. Nurse? Sir? Mr Powell, please, we're jolly nearly overrun on the ward. Well, I'll tell them it was a matter of life and death. That would not be entirely true, now, would it? Everything uh... Are you enjoying being in this hospital? Well...you do get a better class of patient here in London. Do you? I was joking, Mr Powell. How about lunch? In broad daylight, with chaperones? Wheeler's does a bloody good Dover sole. What do you say? I prefer haddock and chips. Oh! Here. Let me help you. Oh. Valerie? What are you playing at? We'd better get you home, dearest. Otto. Did you...? The nurse. The nurse? Oh, yes! That nurse. Yes, she wanted nothing to do with money. What do you mean? She was there. She helped. Just keep the money safe. What is going on? You have to take this seriously. Do you hear me? You are looking terrifyingly studious. I want to make a good impression. For Mehta. (BIRD CALLS) (SINGS SOFTLY) (DOG BARKS) (CONTINUES SINGING) There is no little one, is there? I lost it. We only hitched in record time because you were pregnant. When? When did you lose it? On the morning of the wedding. Why didn't you tell me, Jean? I'm sorry. And Otto knew... ..when he walked you up the aisle? Who the hell does he think he is? Please, darling. He did it for us. You wouldn't have gone through with it. Did you honestly believe I'd cancel the whole shooting match. Oh, Jeannie. You're my wife now. Mrs Truscott. We're meant for each other. You do still love me, don't you, Ricky? Of course I do. (BIRDSONG) Nothing serious. Though I think a day in bed probably wouldn't do any harm. Now, I will have words if Mrs J has it the moment my back is turned you're out building a tree house. Understood? You are good with him. I'm renowned for my bedside manner, Mrs Powell. Have a lovely day, one and all. Now, Lily, I've got to impress Mehta on his first day. There. That one. Yes? Most distinguished, Dr Enderbury. Really. Regimental. Says more. Yes. You do think things through in a clever way. It doesn't look like I'm boasting? Maureen, are you up? Maureen. Listen to me. There was money here in this jar. Sorry? Did you use it yesterday? What, no? Of course not! Dad! Dad, are you decent? He hasn't gone walkabout again, has he? He's not here. Right. I didn't take it. I'd never take anything from you. I know what you've done for me, honestly. Nurse Wilson, I swear... (WHISTLING) Dad? Dad, are you in there? (TRAIN CHUGGING) Dad? What? What are you doing in there? I'm waiting on the number 27 from Sidcup bypass! What's it look like? Look, I've got ten bob. You can take it. Well, get some bread from Thompson's on the corner and some milk. I'll pay you back. And remember what we agreed, OK. Don't let him out. Like Colditz? Like Colditz, precisely. What about my father? He'll be looking for me. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Mrs Mulligan. I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. That's quite all right. Mr... Chief Inspector. So, Matron... Good honeymoon, Richard? Intercourse when you're married is of an entirely different order. Don't you agree? I wish you wouldn't. MCC necktie, Dr Enderbury? You a cricketer? Oh, this is Richard Truscott. Dr Mehta. How do you do? Have you a considerable list this morning? Oh, full of women, I suspect. We all have to be terribly serious, working for the National Health. It's in the contract. Good to have you on board. You know Dr Enderbury. Yes, of course. No hard feelings, I very much hope. Good God, no. No. No. Bowling the maiden over? Are you a cricketing man? However Dr Truscott may crack jokes, we are a united front in this brave new world. Would you mind frightfully if I were to observe you, Dr Enderbury, in theatre? You must understand, we can't keep our patients under lock and key, and your daughter is a grown... We lost our Stuart some years ago and I am not certain I could lose another child. I'm sorry to hear that. Might Maureen have gone to a friend? She is due to be married. Why would she just disappear? Young women are prone to emotion. We will find her. Beattie. We all greatly admire Charlie, Dr Mehta. "Calm under pressure" could be his middle name. Albeit not a particularly catchy middle name. There we are, Mrs Salmon. All your gubbins out. Right, stitching time. All right? There. You know, I think I might knit our ravishing Nurse Low here a sweater. What do you say? (SHE GIGGLES) Was that hotel all it's cracked up to be? Don't take me for a fool, Otto. Why didn't you tell me what you did for Jean? I'll show you one of these days. Shall we get running and walking in the right order first, old man? There's some peer review commentary in the Lancet this week. Donaldson - may the great man forgive me, please - is a dinosaur. Just waiting to be wiped out by a great big meteorite! I mean it. Richard... ..you simply don't know how lucky you are. ♪ Bom bom bom bom ♪ If I had a needle and thread ♪ Tell you what I'd do ♪ If I had a needle and thread ♪ I'd sew myself to you ♪ That's what I'd do ♪ I'm telling you... I stole it. Well, Charlie does count every penny, but I found it looking lonely in his trouser pocket. Do you disapprove? No. No, I don't think I do. Well, this is on me, so you are complicit. That's terribly kind of you, but there's no need. Oh, there is. You and Mr Powell are so generous. Have you ever had a pizza before? No, I don't think I have. Well, you see, my friend... ..she wants a baby more than anything in the world, but...it's not, well...happening. Can I ask you a question, dearest? Can it be the man's fault? There. I asked. I told her I would. What do you mean? He - the man... ..doesn't manage to... ..at all. Isn't Jean quite lovely? Yes. Just so. (LAWNMOWER WHIRS) (COUGHING) Mrs J? Mrs J! Now, Thomas, I told you to stay in bed, or there will be words from your mother. Thomas? (LAUGHTER) Valerie! The truth is you're finding life a bit of a struggle. Do you want to have a go, see if you can get anything out of her? Mrs Smallwood... Valerie? She hasn't uttered a word in here. She was screaming like a banshee at me half the night, head full of nonsense. What do you know about "the change", Valerie? Well, of course you know about that. No-one wants to live alongside someone whose hormones are turning them into a monster, do they, Valerie? I don't think you quite understand... Right. Look, nowadays we have a choice. Well, for the bleeding, a nice straightforward hysterectomy. You'll be feeling a new woman in no time. Or, on the other hand... Yeah, we could pop you on a really modern course of hormone replacement, a simple pill that in a couple of months will trick your body into believing it belongs to a much younger woman. The flushes, the sagging, the sweating - everything gone. And, hey presto, it's welcome to the 1960s. The husbands, I'm told, complain they can't keep up. So, if you just pop your things off over here... I'm sorry, but my husband is having an affair. Why don't we listen to the doctor and see what he suggests, dear? What do you like to do with your time, Valerie? She's a devil with a nine iron. Aren't you, old girl? Well, there we go. We'll have you beating the girls half your age in no time. Ha. Are you married? Just, sir. Not cheap to run, are they? Not sure I follow you. Wives. Look, isn't there something you can give poor old Val, to help her? I mean, an op's one thing and drugs... We... She... She really needs something today. I'm not sure how much more of this I can stand. Mr Smallwood? Oh, come on, man. Drugs. You know the type of thing. What, you mean a tranquilliser? I think we'd better go and see the top man. I'm not someone who likes to waste his time. Erm... I'm not a psychiatrist but er... Librium or something? Well, you're the bloody doctor. Good work, old chap. What's your poison? Nothing special, but it gets me from A to B. Better... Best, actually. Look... Listen. Why don't I take you to the Black Boy...? Don't... But a jar to celebrate your first day. No, that is most kind of you, Dr Enderbury, but I... Little woman at home? Have you lost something? Nothing... Nothing serious. Well, £5, actually. We must find you your own department. Hm? You won't want me bossing you around for long. (CHATTER) (ENGINE STARTS) Ricky? Ah, Jeannie... What's in the box? Champagne. It's a present...from the husband of a patient. Ricky, whatever's the matter? I'm a lucky man, aren't I? Aren't I? I'm thinking of changing the Morris for a bicycle. But, Charlie, you love that car! Well... Don't be late. Shoot! This is extremely serious. Master Powell has one of the worst cases of Latin Declensionitus I have ever seen. But he's fit for school so long as his legs don't actually fall off. Good God, man, how can you laugh at a time like this? Don't be silly, Daddy. What? Say aah. Aah. What was that terrible noise, Mrs J? Mummy! Now eat up, young man, or you'll be late for school. It's a glorious morning. Cheerio, one and all. Isn't Daddy happy today, Mummy! Yes. He is. (ENGINE PURRS) (BUZZING) (BUZZING) Lily. What are you doing here? I promised to uh... Oh, I'm sorry. My head is... Your feet probably haven't touched the ground! I promised I'd show you how to throw together a souffle. Though I'm sure if you'd rather... Dr Truscott was er...celebrating. Oh. Well, I brought some eggs. Is that a Kenwood? Oh. Well, you're hardly going to run out of champers, are you? Do you want some? I'm fine. Play your cards right, patients - or their betters - will give you just about anything. Charlie most definitely wouldn't approve. Well, why don't you get dressed and I'll get going. Where's the dish? Dish? Sorry, my head is... That will be the...you-know-what. I mean the souffle dish. Our wedding present. Oh, I'm sure I can find it. Here. Listen to this. (POP MUSIC) Well, that's quite the best radiogram I've ever heard! Otto and Elizabeth gave it to us, for the wedding - incredibly generous. Make yourself at home. I'll just go and throw something on. Dr Enderbury, I would like to let our lovely visitors in. Just getting a drip up here, Sister, so Miss Tilling can feel more like herself. Could you lend me a nurse? Mm-hm. Nurse. Remember, ladies, our families like to see a happy face! Ah, Nurse Wilson. Mr Powell and I run a very tight ship. If what happened isn't for you, forget all about it. Understand? Could you fetch the dressing trolley, please? Val. I didn't expect to see you today. (SCREAMS) Where better to start than in the kitchen with a cheese souffle? Charlie says there's nothing like it in the entire known universe. So, eggs. How did you meet Charlie? I was a junior nurse in Paediatrics. One day, a Dr Enderbury came to check up on a lovely little fellow who'd had his appendix out. The moment I saw him, I knew. That's lovely. He's seen action. Field medic in Italy. Stayed in and got posted on to Cyprus. This is also the basis of meringue and custard. You'll be wanting custard when the little one is teething. I suspect he and Mr Powell lived out eight of their nine lives in Cyprus. Of that I'm certain. What about you? A little one? Oh, gosh, no. Not yet. There's money to think about. Charlie wants to get further up the slippery pole before I start moaning at him and being sick everywhere. And besides, you've got to show me the ropes. You'll soon know all about having a baby! What happened on the ward was extremely serious, Mrs Smallwood. When I came here this morning, I just wanted her to tell me the truth. But when I saw her, every fibre in me knew. I'm still not entirely sure I'm pleased that doctor stopped me. Can't see the children coming to see Mummy in Holloway. My life is over. Mrs Gilbert isn't pressing charges. Well, she hardly wants all Kingston to know. And I haven't telephoned the police. Not yet, Mrs Smallwood. Oh? This is a National Health Service. And health isn't solely concerned with the body. But there's nothing wrong with my mind. I understand that Dr Truscott prescribed Provarian and Librium for you yesterday? But I'm not ill. You're not in control of your emotions, Mrs Smallwood. Have you started taking the medication? You'll feel entirely different. The Provarian will stop the flushes and the bleeding. You'll be able to sleep. And the Librium will change everything. It'll relax you. I don't want to relax! I discovered that my husband of 31 years has been fucking the secretary of the golf club and I want to kill her. I'm sorry. That was not appropriate language. I know women. I work with them and I know that sometimes we need to be tamed. Who... Who is it? Um... Um... Um... What's your name? Uh... Monty. No, no. Come on. Look, it... It'll be my father. Oh. Monty! Oh, I've come, sir, to see Nurse Wilson? Get away from the window! Sir, please. I can't be late for the train! Miss Mulligan? I was so happy for you. I'm sorry. And it's terrible to lose it. (BUZZING) Oh, you'd better get that. Besides, I've got to go. Is that the time? What are you doing here? Jeannie, I need you. And when the timer goes Jean, take the souffle out. What was that? Wrong floor, can you believe. Next week, why don't I show you my prawn cocktail? Invaluable when you're entertaining, as I'm sure you will do. (GIGGLES) Sorry. Well, I'd better run along, then. God, I feel a cow. You are a cow! You've come bursting in here like a lunatic. And you shoved me in a blooming cupboard. God, I miss you. I miss you too. I'm on lunch. I've got under five seconds but I'm desperate. They will dismiss you if you're late. Dad took the money from the pot. I don't know what he's done with it but I need bread and bacon and milk. Ange, we agreed. I'll give you what I can. (COINS RATTLING) Poor Dad. Thank you. Looks like you landed on your feet here, Jeannie. I lost the baby. It went. Oh, Jeannie. Jeannie, I'm so sorry. I don't know what to do. Oh, love. I'm not sure I can do this. Oh, love. What the hell are you doing here, Mr Powell? If you've got bodies buried under the floorboards, I wouldn't think any the worse of you. It's not that. No, I know. Some things are best kept... Quite so. How did you find where I live? I followed you home. Last night. I couldn't help myself. Mr Powell, I... I don't know about you, but I for one am absolutely starving, so... I'm going to go to the cafe around the corner. Thank you for bringing my lunch in. I honestly think I'd forget my own head if it wasn't for you, Lily. I'm sure you'd find it again. Two teas, please. To be honest, I wasn't sure walking away like that would have the desired effect. I can't stay. I'm already incredibly late. Mr Powell? Pulse sluggish: undernourished. There's no way you'd be safe with my patients. Let go of my hand, please. I'm sorry. But you should eat. Mr Powell...we're both married. The last I heard from Joe was a postcard from Oman. He's coming home. You must understand. I cannot. Besides, I don't want or need or require any more trouble in my life, so can we just... I do understand. I have never felt like this. Sorry. Taxi! (MEN LAUGHING) Ah, Doctor... Caramba. Uh... I can't... I don't feel anything, Doctor. Is that correct? I've been taking the pills you gave me and I...I don't feel anything at all... Nothing. Mrs Smallwood? All right. Oh, dear. Mrs Smallwood. Sister. Come on. Patients to see. All right. Here we go. Let's get you somewhere more comfortable. Catherine of Aragon, divorced... Anne Boleyn... ..chopped her head off? Yes. Divorced, beheaded, died... divorced, beheaded, survived! Yes? Jane Seymour died. I'd like a word with Mrs Powell. Can I ask what it's regarding? Suffice to say I'm a Police Inspector. Can I help, Mrs J? Mrs Powell. He says he's a... Yes. I heard. You are? Chief Inspector Mulligan. There go my manners. You probably want Mr Powell, my husband. He's not here, unfortunately. No, I'd like a word with you, if I may. Me? Well, then, I suppose you'd better come in. Shall I telephone Mr Powell? No. That will not be necessary. Sausage and mash for Thomas's tea, I think. And some of those lovely tomatoes from the greenhouse. But I hate tomatoes. Dislike, young man, not hate. It's quite a residence, this. Nice lawns. You've done very well for yourselves. Very well indeed. What's this about, Chief Inspector? And a son! Handsome lad. Bright? I don't understand... Ronald. Ronald, please. I only have a girl, now. Maureen is her mother's daughter. I longed for another son but... Life changes. And from that moment, nothing is ever the same again. Powell cut me dead at the hospital. Cyprus. 1953. I want you to go. Oh, Powell was so desperate then. The terror of what happened. The mistakes and the lies. But you know that, don't you? But he's... He's done very well, I can say. He's worked for it all. He's a lucky man. Can you imagine how it feels to be me, standing here knowing that I gave him - you - all this? Look at me. He gave you money, he paid you. In your bedroom, Mrs Powell, is a photograph. An American airman. I have not forgotten what Powell did, or Dr Enderbury. Not in nine years. Like I say, life changes. Do you want more money, Chief Inspector? I can give you money. How could a man not want to share a bed with you? He works very hard... So you keep saying. I want you to go... ..to leave me alone or I will use this. Think. My colleagues at Scotland Yard will not rest until you are on the gallows. Young Thomas's life will be destroyed, the shame alone. One word to Mr Powell and the effect will be the same. I will expose what him and Enderbury did in Cyprus and this all comes to an end. What do you want? I've never seen anything like you, Elizabeth. What happens is up to you. (THUNDER) You have a fine gynaecologist, Mrs Truscott. You should have no trouble conceiving after that miscarriage. How are things? How much do I owe you? Jean, please. Thank you. I um... I don't want to get up the duff for a little while. After it went, I... Well, I decided. Not for a year or two at least. Just until Richard and I settle. And I was wondering about this new pill. I'm married now. Of course. I think you'd be very suitable. It works? Mm-hm. All the trials have been effective. It'd be such a relief, you know. To be like a bloke, I suppose. (THUNDER) Does Richard know? You should use normal precautions for a month. Jean? The new girl... Is she up to it? You know what I mean? Well, I don't know. Yes, probably. But she's not keen on the specials. I'm sure we can find another nurse. No need to worry on my and Charlie's account. Good. That's good news. Well, if you ever need me for a special, you know, or something... ..I'm sure I can slip away. I miss you. And Dr Enderbury. We were quite a team, weren't we? We were, Jean. We were. Richie. Been a long time. You're looking well. Qualified, I imagine. Margaret, you... Why don't you stop by for a devilish little martini sometime? You know how I make them. I need to get our young friend to a hospital. Hospital? We might as well advertise why we're here! But I need your name, sir. You are aware of Sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against The Persons Act? It's over for him. And you. Over. You and Jean...know each other? Richie Truscott. I'm old enough to be your mother... Tommy, darling! Tommy! Cardiac arrest.
