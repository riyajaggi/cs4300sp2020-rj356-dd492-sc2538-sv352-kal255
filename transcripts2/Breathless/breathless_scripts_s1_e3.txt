 Breathless (2013): Season 1, Episode 3 - Episode #1.3 - full transcript 
 Charlie, Otto and Jean go to Soho to perform an abortion on young Megan Grieve but complications arise, requiring an admission to hospital, where Jean encounters Angela - who keeps quiet about her sister's involvement. The police are brought in and, whilst Otto successfully fobs them off, Charlie is anxious that they will be found out and, distracted, blames himself when a patient dies. Richard resumes his affair with Margaret, lying to Jean that he has been working late but she notices the lipstick on his shirt. Jean visits Angela at the house, where she is hiding Maureen Mulligan, confiding in her her fear about her husband's infidelity. Later she confronts him but he is customarily bland in his reply. Mulligan continues to hound Elizabeth Powell, putting pressure on her for sex in return for keeping silent about the death of a young boy in Cyprus for which he holds Otto responsible.

 I want to go ahead with the wedding. You should be in a hospital. Mr Powell, please. I lost the baby. - When did you lose it?  - On the morning of the wedding. What you did for Jean... I promise you, I'll show you one of these days. (KNOCKS AT DOOR) Miss Mulligan? What about my father? He'll be looking for me. - How did you find where I live? - I followed you home.

 Mr Powell... ..we're both married. - Cyprus 1953.  - He gave you money. He paid you. In your bedroom, Mrs Powell, is a photograph of an American airman. I have not forgotten what Powell did or Dr Enderbury. Not in nine years. How could a man not want to share a bed with you? I want you to go, to leave me alone or I will use this. My colleagues at Scotland Yard will not rest until you are on the gallows. Young Thomas's life will be destroyed. What happens is up to you. Richard? Been a long time. Margaret.

(LAUGHTER) WOMAN: Hello, handsome. MAN: Yeah, down there on the right. (KNOCKS AT DOOR) (TRUMPET BEING PLAYED) Ah, Mr Powell. Come in. Thank you. Take five, Ernie, please. Five bob a week, but they're lovely boys. So...here we are, then. This is my niece. Our Megan Grieves. And this is er... I'm Otto. May I call you Megan? So, when do you think you conceived? Do you mind? Thank you. Aah... It's all right. Ow. Sssh, ssh. It's OK. (LAUGHTER) (DISTANT MUSIC AND CHATTER) ♪ Peter Gunn ♪ Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah... Thanks, darling. Nothing so headless as a young girl coming to London for the first time. Don't you count it? Right. I need to get our young friend to a hospital. Hospital? Jean, I'd like you with Megan. Where's your telephone? Hospital? We might as well advertise why we're here. Some idiot gave her a chemical douche. That girl has nasty internal burns. I wouldn't be surprised if she was septic. Otto, please. Charlie... Go home. I don't want Kathleen to come to hospital. Then she won't. Please don't leave me. I promise you. Have you had a baby, miss? No. No, I haven't. But you are married. (BAND PLAYS JAZZ) Hello. Are you all right? Are you sure? Richard Truscott! Years go by and then suddenly you're everywhere. Margaret. What an amazing surprise! Can I get you a... Thank you. ..drink? Well, if the walls could talk... There'd barely be a marriage left in London. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I don't like singles hovering at the bar. It can give the wrong impression. Surely old friends get special treatment. None that I can think of. Besides, old friends don't just vanish, do they? What about your wife? Hm. I don't have a - Oh, come on, Richie. You're a doctor. You're bound to have bagged yourself a pretty little nurse. Babies. I do have a nurse at home. No babies. And a terrible desire to undress you. Chin-chin. Jeannie? Is everything all right? I left Richard a note saying I'd gone to the theatre. Perhaps this isn't for you after the miscarriage? Go home. I can handle this. And leave you without a nurse carrying the can? Sleep tight. Well...good night, Mrs Powell. Good night, Mrs J. We have a friend. They should bloody well arrest the aunt. Let me sort this. No. I'm not running away. Never run away. You all right? So what time was the ambulance called? Sir? Thank you for your help. Excuse me. Sir? This gentleman was passing, enquired whether there was anything he could do. Thank you. Very good. If you'll excuse me, my patient's in the back of that ambulance. Right. Good night, then. Hope it all works out. Thank you. But I need your name, sir. Powell. (AMBULANCE BELL) How old are you now, Richie? 30. I'm old enough to be your mother. (CHUCKLES) I'd really rather not have her in my mind, if you don't mind. Ow! Nearly there. It hurts. Sssh, sssh, sssh. I have to go now. Please, please don't leave me. All right. (TELEPHONE RINGS) North Wing One? Casualty admissions here. We have a young woman. Emergency admission, Sister. I'll go. Megan Grieves. Possible pelvic infection and vaginal bleeding after a potassium permanganate douche. Thank you. I'm Nurse Wilson. We'll get you something for the pain. Consulting room, Nurse, and prep an irrigation if you'd be so kind. Thank you. Sorry. Coming here was not part of the plan. Forgotten how much I missed it. Yes, well, make yourself scarce before someone starts asking questions. Oh. How did you enjoy the theatre? Always get your lies straight, Mrs Truscott. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) 'Yuri Gagarin's single orbit of the earth...' (COMMENTARY CONTINUES ON TV) Charlie, dear. We had a late list in theatre. (SIGHS) You are the worst possible liar. Why do you do it? I tell you what, I am famished. You and Otto will be struck off. And in prison. Seriously! Lily...please! No, you, please, stop. We need the money. (SIGHS) I could go back to work, at least until - Don't be ridiculous. You are my wife! Besides, Lil, if Otto and I don't do it heaven help those poor girls. "If Otto," "if Otto". What about you, Charlie? What about us? (KEY IN LOCK) (FOOTSTEP CREAKS) I thought you'd be fast asleep. Er...I was worried. Where have you been, darling? That junior consultants' dinner, remember? You know how these things drag on. Mwah! How about you? Er...the theatre. Something jolly, I hope. Yes. Very. Jolly and long, darling. It is rather late. Working nights? Sir. I'll make sure Sister gets those in the morning. You have an odd habit of running away from me whenever I approach. It could be that whenever you approach I have somewhere else I really ought to be. You and Jean - Mrs Truscott... ..know each other? Yes, we worked together. Briefly. But I was surprised to see her here with one of your patients, sir. (WHISPERS) The police are here to see you, sir. Very good. For you. In here, sir. Thank you. Ah. Smoke? Constable Weir here has it that you summoned an ambulance to - 19 Lexington Mews, yes. Why, Mr Powell? That's entirely between me and my patient... I'm sorry. Detective Inspector Thompson. Yes, er... Zealotry in the young can be tiresome but er...train a constable on the streets and he reports what he sees. For eg: you...carrying medical gas bottles from the premises. I'm not in the habit of abandoning expensive equipment. You are aware of Sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against The Persons Act? Again, what transpires between my patients and I is confidential by law. And by law it is illegal to terminate - I will give you this. The young woman - my patient - is out of danger now. Oh. And her unborn baby...is also well. Good evening. (BELL RINGS) OTTO: It makes the lather light. Daddy, it tickles. Everything OK, Mrs J? Yes, it's just the laundry, Mrs Powell. Now, I once knew a chap, who was doing this when he had the most almighty desire to sneeze. Time for school, Thomas, darling. Yeah, I haven't seen the chap! I'm pretty sure he ran away to join the circus. (GIGGLES) What have you been doing? Daddy's been teaching me. Well, I have a brand-new idea. Thomas, why don't you stay with Mummy? You too, Otto. Well, this chap has school, you have a bridge morning and I have half a million patients. That bus won't wait, Master Powell. Otto, I... Elizabeth, are you all right? It's difficult, this. Yes, it is sometimes, isn't it? You haven't forgotten tonight? No excuses, Otto - Jean and Richard are taking us out. Don't be late. Cold! Cold! All right. I saw your parents yesterday at the hospital. Why not just let them know you're all right? No. He'll show up here soon enough. He's a police inspector. They're...good at finding people. When should we go to the station? We're not going anywhere, Dad. What about your mother? (SIGHS) You don't know what Father's like. Ever since my brother Stewart drowned, he... It did him in, you know. Anyway... Besides, I can look after you, can't I, Monty? And I look after her. I can. Well, that's all right, then. NURSE: Miss Fairfax, please. The GP said to pop in, so...here I am. Now, Miss...Fairfax. Yes? What seems to be the problem? What can you feel? Oh! Is this what they mean by giving your body to science? Diagnosis, gentlemen? Why didn't you call trumps? Just call trumps. But I didn't think I'd need to! I think sandwiches might be preferable to blood on the carpet, don't you? Always call trumps, dear. And, please, in future, don't think. Elizabeth, I wonder if I might have a little word. Was Otto terribly late last night? He's usually - Charlie was in the most... well, you know how he is. Ah, Mrs J. You saint. Oh, they do look smashing! One day the police - Lily, please, let's not always expect the worst. (CHATTER) You received Miss Grieves, last night? Admitted for...? Inflammation, burning. An attempted termination with potassium... Yes. And is the subject of a police enquiry. Who brought her here? Matron? She came in an ambulance. Oh, for pity's sake, child. I don't know who you're trying to protect. A woman I did not know came with her. And Mr Powell. Off you go. Thank you, Mrs J. Chief Inspector Mulligan here. No damage done, I'm pleased to report. But that stuff is neither effective nor recommended. Oh, Aunt Kathleen panicked. Well, you're clearly feeling better. Do you still want to go through with it? No. The moment he's born I'm going to strap him to my back, then we'll go to Provence in France and paint! What about the baby's father? I haven't the foggiest idea where I'd find him. I've shocked you! Haven't you ever done anything simply out of desire? Are you one of those blokes who has it all in control? Well, I...I wouldn't say that. Oh, yes. Everything thought through and planned before you do anything. (CHUCKLES) Mr Powell? Everything OK, sir? Yes...I'm just trying to work out what to say or do now... ..without thinking it through or planning it. What are you talking about? It's impossible! Mr Powell, I was interrogated coming on shift about... The police are involved. So I keep hearing. And the nurse involved, I wouldn't want... Well, as an ex-colleague I wouldn't want anything bad to happen to her. Jean is a friend. I won't let anything bad happen to her. Trust me. (MUSIC PLAYING FROM CLUB) To Mr and Mrs Boss! Thank you. For getting us two down the aisle, like you did. Well, this place isn't nearly as depraved as the papers cut it out to be. You sound disappointed. Richie! Jeannie's taken to going to the theatre. What was it you saw last night? The reviews for My Fair Lady aren't all true, are they? It was great, actually. Dr Truscott. Margaret. What a pleasure. Ha-ha! Otto Powell. Hello. My wife Elizabeth. Hello. And you must be Mrs Richard Truscott? It's a pleasure. Charmed, I'm sure. I've known Margaret for years. Haven't I, darling? I'll find out what chef likes best tonight, shall I? Shall we dance? ♪ Dah-dah, dah-dah, dah, dah, dah-dah... What's Richard playing at? He's playing at hurting you, Jeannie, dear. He's hurt and he's going to hurt you back. Dad's having his sleep. The last thing I want is him waking up. Maureen, would you mind? That's a lovely scarf. Mo, please. If this is a lecture coming, Ange, I can think of places - I just want to know why. Sounds like a lecture, Ange. The police are onto it. Nothing happened, all right? Nothing. Jeannie, please. I used to help Mr Powell and Dr Enderbury. When I stopped, I suggested you so you could make a few quid. But then you, all holier than thou, refused to take their money and now you seem frightfully worried that I did help them. I didn't do it often if that's what you're thinking. You don't need the money. Jeannie, are you all right? Right as rain. Never better. Mum used to do that. What? You know. "Right as rain. Never better." I don't know what's going on, I really don't. Richard didn't come back last night. What do you mean? Just that. We were out with Mr and Mrs Powell, and then suddenly he said he had an emergency and he had to go. There probably was an emergency at the hospital and I'm just imagining things. I'm playing bridge now, Ange. Tomorrow Mr and Mrs Truscott are taking us to the evening races at Newbury. Next thing I know I'll be buried in the family cemetery! What, Ange? I just wanted to warn you, that's all. There was no emergency, Jeannie. I was working nights. Richie didn't come to the hospital. What are you going to do? Hey. Time to get back to the real world. Will you do this up for me, darling? Thank you. You know, you are... ..everything I remember. Oh, a little storm damaged? God, no! More beautiful. More ravishing. (CHUCKLES) What the hell are you doing? Making love to you. No, I mean last night. Bringing them all to the restaurant. Well, Richard? (CHUCKLES) Do not make the mistake of thinking you can play with me, or her. We'll tear you to shreds. (BOTH LAUGH) I mean it, Richard. I think we can release, Mrs Palmer, don't you? You shall miss the food, and we shall miss you. (MRS PALMER LAUGHS) I'm sorry, I've... I've changed my mind about the operation. Miss Fairfax, this is Mr Powell. I can't...go ahead. Madam, you should not be wasting the consultant's time. Sorry, I'm fine. I just... I just don't want to be a bother. Chaps, tell you what, why don't you go and write up exactly what we've decided to do with Mrs Palmer? Three minutes, gentlemen. Yes, Doctor. The op? The general? Look...you can, of course, leave us... ..but I'd be much happier if we made sure that polyp was nothing nasty, wouldn't you? We are all often frightened... ..but sometimes we have to face what frightens us. And, most usually, we get through. It's all right. Come on. You promise, Dr Enderbury. You return the money they gave and you aren't guilty of anything. Dr Enderbury? Actually, I was looking for a patient. That's handy. I have 22 of them. No er, er...Megan...was it? Yes? Grieves. She's just a friend of a friend. The daughter of... She left with her aunt, five minutes ago. Gosh, that is impressive. I remember you. You were at the house - Would you please give this back to your aunt? You give it to her yourself. This is for you. I don't know what you're talking about. You gave me money to perform a procedure. I did no such thing. Come on, Megan, love. It's the truth. Not as I remember it. Gentlemen, I am sorry to have kept you. I've questioned everyone who was on duty that night and, as yet, I can find no-one who appears to be involved in the attempted termination. Thank you for coming, Chief Inspector. Can I get you...? Well, to come to the point. I telephoned and asked you to meet because I have told Mr Powell - Otto exactly what is happening. He was shocked, naturally. But clearly he - we... have nothing to hide. So I telephoned you and asked you to meet... ..to tell you to get out of our life. It's outrageous what you've done... creeping into our home...threatening. Oh. You see, I do have photographs of the scene in Cyprus. And your statements. All the evidence to destroy your lives. Forensic science wasn't cutting-edge back then. I only let the matter rest because of available resources. Faced, as we were, with policing a complicated and troubled island, a second-rate doctor like Otto Powell with an affection for the bottle was not our first priority. Seeing him now, still... at best, contemptuous of the law, well... Hideous. It's over for him, and you. Over. Please. Chief Inspector. Chief Inspector, please. Please, all I'm trying to do - all I've ever tried to do - is protect... Thomas. We do everything to protect them, but anything can happen to them when they're out of our sight. Why are you doing this to me? Because I want you...and all that Powell has. I can't help myself. Such a to-do yesterday morning, hm? The police are interested in the provenance of one of our patients. A girl who had attempted an abortion. They were asking questions, looking under every stone, quite like a thriller. Otto... Charlie. They cannot arrest you for helping somebody into an ambulance. Get a grip. Old man... (KEY RATTLES IN LOCK) Jeannie darling? Come on, Mum and Dad are about to arrive. We're going to the races. I'm not coming. I don't think I feel like it. Don't be daft. They'll be here in a minute. I do mean it, Jeannie. Tell me the truth. Come on, old girl. You know you're the tops. Thanks for that. But try, just for once, to tell me the truth. I love you. I'm certain of it. That's the whole truth. And? And? Her? Margaret? It was a long time ago. You had lipstick on your collar, Richard. Did I? Do not take me for an idiot. I might just be a nurse, and not from somewhere all hoity-toity, but I will not be made a fool. You threw a plate. You threw a plate. (DOOR BUZZER) Oh, bugger. Jeannie? I'll be no time at all. But I mean it, Richard. Sister. I am leaving Nurse Wilson with you to make sure that you don't run off and fly in your aeroplane back to Trinidad without me. Thank you, Sister. Stay with me, please, Nurse. Miss Fairfax. Counting down from ten. Ten...nine... ..eight...seven... All right, gentlemen. This is a standard polyp removal and D and C. I will follow in with a dilatation and then curettage. Should take no more than ten minutes. Miss Fairfax has had occasional bleeding between periods. Could you ask yourselves what histology I will be requesting of the laboratory? There we are. Let's move on to the D and C. Five more minutes, please, Dr Enderbury. Dr Enderbury? I... I'm sorry? Yes. Yes, of course. Excuse me. Excuse me. Good afternoon, Mrs... May I help you? Yes. I'm looking for my son - Thomas Powell. It's only 2.30, Mrs Powell. Yes, of course it is. It's just, well, I... I want him home, you see. Run along, Lower Nine. Please, gentlemen. Chop-chop. Powell? Yes. Righto. He should be on the playing field. So kind. But, Mrs Powell... Mrs Powell! Catch it! Catch it, Simmons! Stop play. Excuse me. I'm looking for Thomas Powell. Tommy? Tommy? Tommy, darling! Tommy! Powell. Tommy! Is that your mother? Tommy! Tommy! Tommy! Tommy, darling! Yes. Tommy! Tommy. There we are. Thank you, theatre. Dr Enderbury? Her BP is dropping. 70 over 50, Mr Powell. Can I help, Charlie? Cardiac arrest! Thank you. Charlie... Charlie! Thank you, theatre. Sister. Would you be so kind as to...ask my House Surgeon to contact the Coroner's Officer. Thank you. Of course. (BOYS GIGGLING) Can we go home, please? There's Tommy with his mum. I'm sorry, Tommy. I thought you had a match. I wanted to... Please. Start the car. Please. I think Mrs J might just have a treat for you. (ENGINE STARTS) I don't know what happened. I really don't. Please, Dr Enderbury, go home. I will inspect the machinery. There will be an inquiry. You can do no more. It could have been something undetected. We'll find out with the post-mortem. I encouraged her. Against her fear. I should be back to the ward, Mr Powell. Life is an easy thing to lose. And to waste. Dearest. Good day? You? Super, actually. I think I may have killed a patient. That inspector came. Again. Asked me to give you this. He said you would prefer it if Mr Powell knew nothing. Yes. Yes, it's a silly business, really. Can - Please, Mrs J. A precision error, though understandable, but catastrophic. If there was any error it was mine. I'm afraid that one day he is going to leave me hanging. I wanted you to know just how much I love you. What happens here... ..is simply to do with pleasure. What are you doing here? Seeing as you didn't come home... Yes, Chief Inspector Mulligan, please. I don't want to hurt you. I will tell you when and where. Do you think life is always like this? I think there's only ever today.
