 Breathless (2013): Season 1, Episode 4 - Episode #1.4 - full transcript 
 Charlie faces an enquiry over the death of his patient, Miss Fairfax, and is quizzed by Mehta over his and Otto's recent involvement with the police though the panel exonerates him of professional negligence. Otto travels to Dorset with Angela and eager young student doctor Sam for an over-night hospital visit to an unmarried girl, raped by her father, who is giving up her triplets for adoption. Taking advantage of his absence Elizabeth also sends her son Thomas away on holiday in order to accommodate Mulligan. Whilst she is waiting for him Charlie arrives, confessing to nervousness about the abortions and also party to the events in Cyprus. After he has left Mulligan turns up for sex with Elizabeth though he fails to bring the promised evidence against Otto. Jean gives a dinner party for her in-laws and colleagues but it is a disaster and she runs to Angela for consolation.

 I need to get our young friend to a hospital. Hospital? We might as well advertise why we're here. - We have a friend. - Sir? You and Jean... -..know each other? - Yes, we worked together. And you must be Mrs Richard Truscott? - It's a pleasure. - Charmed, I'm sure. I've known Margaret for years. Haven't I, darling? Richard didn't come back last night. Do not make the mistake...

 ..of thinking you can play with me OR her. It's outrageous what you've done. Creeping into our home. You see, I do have photographs of the scene in Cyprus. Why are you doing this to me? Cardiac arrest. Charlie. Charlie! Ask my house surgeon to contact the coroner's office. I think I may have killed a patient. That inspector came. Again. He said you would prefer it if Mr Powell knew nothing. Aha. You've traded four wheels for two, I see, Dr Enderbury. (BREATHLESSLY) Actually... The Morris is at the garage again. Reliable simplicity, hm?

 Quite enjoyable, I've found. Have you had to cycle far? No. Must be going on nine miles, I suppose. Hm. (TELEPHONE RINGING) The Powell residence. Hello. Please may I speak with Mrs Powell? It's Mrs Truscott. Mrs Powell's just stepped out. Please be so kind as to inform Mrs Powell I telephoned to invite Mr and Mrs Powell to dine here on Friday. Yes. I'll be sure to give her the message. Goodbye. Good morning, Doctor. Just, you know, checking the equipment before the meeting. Between us, eh? (AMBULANCE BELL) I'd removed the polyp and completed the dilatation and curettage when Dr Enderbury alerted me that Miss Fairfax's cardiac rhythm was erratic. She arrested moments after. This procedure, Mr Powell, had lasted how long, do you estimate? 20 minutes. What are you suggesting, Professor? A simple error of timing by Dr Enderbury? We can all make mistakes. Although I would gladly entrust my life to Charlie Enderbury. He's been my colleague for 15 years. A procedural error - though understandable, but catastrophic. If there was any error, it was mine. That is not what I am suggesting. I know exactly what you're suggesting. Lily? What are you doing here? Oh, nothing. Actually, it's this sad Miss Fairfax inquiry thingy. Dr Enderbury takes these things very seriously. Well, that's what I see. I expect he's the unflinching doctor around this neck of the woods. So no patter of tiny feet yet, then? Gosh, no. Last thing Dr Enderbury needs is me moaning and swelling up and... And how is he? Not working too hard? You know what they're like. With Mr Powell, I mean. Oh, my husband is very much his own man, Matron. You'll find him in the conference room. Certainly took their time. No, honestly. It's rare we get in the room together. Lily. I was doing my errands and thought I'd pop in. Oh, and Mr and Mrs Truscott wondered if we were free for supper Friday. Well, one thing at a time, Lily. Lily, you look enchanting this morning. Don't you think, Charlie? Really, you shouldn't have come. No. You are right. I wanted you to know just how much I love you. Dr Enderbury? If you don't mind. And, naturally, after the tragedy, I checked both the equipment... and our procedures. And again this morning you checked the equipment? A little birdy told me. No? So, if we rule out a technical malfunction, we are left with, as Mr Powell suggested, a human error. Or a pulmonary embolism or some other natural cause. Were you under any undue anxiety? Mehta? Rumour has it that Dr Enderbury had been assisting Mr Powell with a private patient. No. The very night before the unfortunate Miss Fairfax passed away. And Matron Vosper tells me that the police had mentioned - Oh, that. Yes. The emergency admission. It wasn't here, though. So where? At a house. Uh, but nothing happened. Can I ask what private procedure required an anaesthetist at night, at a private residence? (BIRDSONG) I have never seen anything as beautiful. I didn't ask you into my life, did I, Mrs Powell? I never expected... But things - No. Inspector. Not like this. I will tell you when and where. Now get out of the car. Right... Yes, Sister? I have a job for you. Leaving at dawn. Mr Powell needs a nurse to assist him with a multiple delivery, in Dorset, and he asked for you specifically. If I was you, I'd forget I ever even told you and go home and get a good night's sleep. You hear me? I do. And? I've forgotten you ever told me. Mm-hm. (CLOCK TICKING) (CAR PULLS UP) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (DOOR LOCK CLICKS) Elizabeth. What are you doing sitting in the dark? I...suppose I was lost in thought and the sun set. Busy day? Mrs J left you something. Good night, Otto. I'm off in the morning. I'll be away for the night. Just here, please. Keep the change. (DOORBELL RINGS) Morning. What do you want, Richie? It's the middle of the night for me. You look rough, darling. I've been up all night. It was an emergency. Treating a patient that was desperately ill. It made me want you. (LAUGHS) Christ, how romantic. But I realise I love you. You don't have to love me, you know. I swear I do. Look... Listen. What happens here has got nothing to do with love. All right? You save that love for your beautiful Jean, Richie. What happens here... ..is simply to do with pleasure. Do you understand? Mr Powell. Good morning, sir. Rumour is you're off to Dorset for a multiple delivery with pre-eclampsia. I would give my left leg to witness you at work and if I could be of any use... Sorry. One day I will be Dr Cohen but right now I'm more comfortable with Sam. Sam. I'm afraid I really uh... I actually cannot think of an excuse not to take you. I will be indispensible. Right. Rather against my better judgment - Hello, Nurse. Oh. Cohen. But I am - He is more comfortable as Sam and he is indispensible, Nurse Wilson. Is he, Mr Powell? Well, I certainly hope I'm not the gooseberry. Mrs Powell? I'm not late? Heavens, no! But do let's keep our voices down. Thomas is still asleep. Mr Powell announced late last night he'd been summoned on a mercy mission, so I thought this might be a good few days to introduce him to your parents. In Selsey. A little holiday. We uh...talked about half term. The sea air will clear that nasty chest he seems to have acquired, don't you think? But he has school. I'll telephone the secretary. There's a coach up to Victoria and then, I imagine, a train up to Chichester. You could bring me back some rock. Truscott, have you seen Otto anywhere, old man? Mr Powell, I understand, is in Dorset. A multiple births with complications. Ah, that's right. Completely slipped my mind. No-one to hold your hand, Charlie? The King is dead! Long live the King! You can't leave Hemmings alone with an unconscious girl without there being a... Jeannie! Here you are. Been everywhere. I wanted to tell you we've having the Friday evening do. Ah, there's a good chap. Look, what are you doing here? Seeing as you didn't come home... We were rushed off our feet all night. ..I thought it'd be better if I came here to tell you myself. I've invited Dr and Mrs Taj Mahal... ..the Powells...Charlie and Lily. I can do it. I can. And your mother and father. But, Jeannie, you can't cook and my mother - Lily's promised to help. Well, more than help. But that's not the point, is it? I thought this was what you wanted. Anyway, everyone said they'd be delighted. Eight. Don't be late. You slept. Short night. Atten-shun. Hello. Jackson. You must be Powell. We've cleared you a bed at the nurses' cottage. We're a team, Sister. Very modern. And we have booked three rooms at the Bull's Head. Shall we visit our patient? Ah. After you. Oh, don't you look every bit the brave soldier! You'll have a marvellous time, won't you? Won't he? (HORN TOOTS) That'll be the taxi. Now, Thomas dear. I want you to take particular care of Mrs J and not leave her on the train or lose her at Victoria. For heaven's sake, go. Come on. Bye, darling. Bye. Pre-eclamptic toxaemia, Mr Powell, and three foetal hearts. Thank you, Dr Jackson. Miss Deacon, sir. Uh... Good morning, young lady. (WOMAN CLEARS HER THROAT) Madam. Adoption services, Mr Powell, and I would rather stay in the room, sir. If you must, madam. (SAM CLEARS HIS THROAT) Yes. Chief Inspector Mulligan, please. Chief Inspector Mulligan speaking. Hello, Inspector. You can come to the house at eight o'clock. And bring the statements and the photographs, please. I'll be there. SAM: What's your poison, sir? Apple juice. Ah. Nurse Wilson? Gin and tonic. You don't need to say it. Oh, I think I do. Have we really driven for six hours to deliver babies that are going to be taken from their mother? No. We've driven for six hours to ensure that neither Miss Deacon or her babies come to any harm. And it isn't just that. What? Why I asked you. I've gone over to the dark side, I'm afraid, Mr Powell. That social worker might have been the Gestapo. We are medics. It doesn't mean we can't stop terrible things happening. No, but it does mean that our judgments are based on things we can influence, rather than things we might hope or feel. That is so... Cheers...anyway, and thank you, sir, for allowing me to join you on what has become a nightmare story of babies being ripped from their mother's bosom. To moral certainty. He didn't mean that. Did you, Sam? Yes and no. However, at this moment I am torn between committing professional suicide or going to the toilet. I didn't actually intend to bring a chaperone. He's sort of irresistible. If you like puppies. They have their place. But I am exhausted...and off to bed. Early night. Nurse Wilson... Yes, Mr Powell? Sleep well. What did I say? I thought I was walking the line between "charm" and "sensitive" effortlessly. It's not you. She's tired. Well, she is absolute bloody dynamite, if you ask me, Mr Powell. I probably shouldn't have brought her. Oh, I don't know. Don't drink? Or just not tonight? If you don't mind me asking. An enquiring mind should know its limits, Cohen. Sorry, sir, if I'm too forward. I don't drink because I once, under the influence, made a terrible mistake. Cheers. Cheers. (CAR PULLS UP) (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (DOOR KNOCKER) Charlie. Elizabeth. I'm sorry. I was going to telephone but... Uh... Otto's not here. No, I know. That's why I... Can I come in? Can I get you something, Charlie? No. No, thank you. I... Is everything all right, Elizabeth? Yes. I...just was surprised. I wasn't expecting anyone. Where's Tommy? Um... Mrs J wanted to see her mother. He had a nasty chest, so they're in Selsey. They thought they'd make a trip of it for a few days. And so I'm here...alone, Otto delivering babies. Yes. You know, a whisky soda would... Coming right up. Actually, it was in fact Otto I wanted to talk to you about. Chin-chin. You see...um... ..I could be in a touch of bother. Oh, you know, I do worry and I do absolutely rely on Otto. Are you sure you're all right, Elizabeth? Whatever do you mean? You seem... Well, distracted. Good heavens, no. I wouldn't be in this mess if it wasn't for Otto and his specials. And do you know, dear Elizabeth, if a police inspector was to walk in here right now, I'm not sure I wouldn't just put my hands up and say "guilty as charged". I'm afraid that one day he is going to leave me hanging in the wind. Otto cares for you like a brother. I don't think so. I don't think Otto cares for anyone but himself. Charlie, that's a terrible thing to say. I can feel the noose tightening. Otto should know, from me... ..I will not keep silent about what happened in Cyprus - about him and you. I'm sorry, Elizabeth, for ever. If...I - Charlie. We lied for him. I had blood on my hands and I am lying still. You are too. Charlie... Otto will never let you down, or me. I know that. Besides, you are a very special friend. Yes. Could be that...poor woman died of natural causes. No fault. Could be. What was Dr Enderbury doing here just now? He arrived unannounced, Inspector. Please, Elizabeth... ..there is no reason to lie to me. I'm not. Now, would you please give me the statements and the photographs you have? You are so beautiful. I asked for the best money could buy. Young lady laughed and said, "It must be for someone very special." I need the statements. Of course. I don't want to hurt you. You'd better go, Inspector. Ronald. Please. You've been in my head... ..driving me wild... I've not slept, thinking about you. Imagining us together. But then to... ..so quickly. I'm sorry. Please... I've done what you wanted, now just give me the statements and the photographs. (HE SOBS) What have I become? There's a part of me... There's a...part of me that's missing. My son died and... I've been looking, searching to fill that part... (SOBS) ..not like this. No... Not like this. It's all right...Ronald. Just give me what you have... I didn't bring them. I was convinced you were trying to trick me. I'm sorry. (BELL TOLLING) (MISS DEACON MOANS AND GASPS) Oh, God! Oh, God! (BABY CRIES) Mummy! Darling. I absolutely begged Mrs J to come back early because I left him. Well, I suspect he missed you just as much as you missed him. This one looks just like my da. He's strong. Like my da. Ah, there you are. I was just on my way. Shall we? We're lucky that Alice is alive and has three healthy babies. We are not like you people from London, Doctor. A child conceived out of wedlock is one thing. Her father forced himself on her. He is the father of those children. And Miss Deacon is a minor. Yes, Mr Powell. We will care for them and Alice when she turns to us. Thank you for what you've done. Seeing those babies being delivered... the way you helped Alice... I don't think I've ever felt more alive... ..or happier. And then to be told they were... Do you think life is always like this - playing tricks on you? I think... Truthfully? I think there's only ever today. Now. I wish... ♪ Do yourself a favour ♪ Have a Medley Medical grade, I'm hoping. Lack of oxygen is, of course, the route of all this. If a patient... Ah, Dr Enderbury, good news. Natural causes. As we always thought. Miss Fairfax died of natural causes. Obviously the danger with cerebral hypoxia... I'm home, dearest. We want ample time to get you to the Truscotts'. You're early, darling. I know how Jeannie's relying on you. Something else, Lil. Something else. I didn't make a mistake. No. I was sure. But, you see, I wasn't. I know what I am doing and all this has been eating me up. For what reason? Lily? Thank you. Good night. (SIGHS) All I want to do is stop feeling what I'm feeling, but I can't, and I do not know what to do any more. I just want to be near you, nothing more. Good night. Good night. That nurse. Do you think...me and her? Sir? Well, you never know, do you? OTTO: Would you like to telephone your husband, Mrs Dalton? I always found marriage rather too ball-and-chain for my taste, Dr Powell. Is there anyone? I run a restaurant and a night club. What do you think? So, it's that serious? The tests - the biopsy - should tell me more. Yes. Well, I always argued "live for the moment". I suppose I've been a fool. You should have come to see me months ago. The symptoms - Like I said, I... What are you going to say to Richard Truscott? How on earth do you know about that? The moment he introduced us at dinner. You don't have to face this alone. I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to do. What time is it? Late. Well, what about Jean? (THEY CHUCKLE) Oh, Lil. Where the sodding heck are you? (DOOR BUZZER) Coming, Lil! I know we are early but one cannot make sense of the London Underground and we could hardly walk the streets dressed like this. This is my good wife, Professor Mehta, but we mere mortals are sometimes allowed to call her Patricia. Please, do come in. Thank you. Drink? What can I...? Oh, where is Dr Truscott? Oh, he's just obsessed by his patients, working every hour. God... Gin? Good evening. (BIG BEN CHIMES) My God, I want you so badly. I really do. I slipped in downstairs. You've got a perfectly good wife. Can't I have both of you? You are monstrous. No, Richard. No. No. Seriously. If we're all still alive in five years, let's meet again. As adults. Just for pleasure. We are ever so lucky. Richard's parents were frightfully generous. He was in oil. He went to India. Maybe you met him. (DOOR BUZZER) Oh. That'll be Lil. I'll go. So...a professor? Of...? International affairs. University Of London. Gosh almighty. You must be an absolute brainbox. Gin and tonic, please. Jean. Dearest. Thomas got very anxious in Selsey. Children worry at things. Everything - and I mean everything I do - is for Thomas, and Thomas alone. Please, Mrs J. Now... I shouldn't be late. And I'm not at all sure whether Mr Powell will be back in time to join me or whether he'll come straight home. Right. Let's take a look. Jean, when did you put this in? Just now, a second ago. (HICCUPS) The first thing she said was, "Where's my bracelet?" "Doctor, where's my bracelet?" All the theatre could say was, "Luckily, not where you left it." (LAUGHTER) That's really quite funny. Thank you. Boom-boom. Dearest. Ah. You're working too hard. Are you feeling guilty, Dr Truscott? Mm. Ah. These are for you, darling. Where have you been? You're late. You promised me you wouldn't be late. You promised you would tell me the truth. Professor Mehta, do you know Johnny Dankworth? It's eight o'clock. I had to go to the florist. What a spread. (JAZZ PLAYS) This is delicious, Jean. You should have said we were vegetarians. You look quite transformed, Mrs Enderbury. Something changed? No. Whatever do you mean? Cheers, everyone. Mm. (MUSIC ENDS) I wonder if we haven't had enough. Now, Mother... Whatever do you mean, dearest? Let Jeannie be. Whatever you say. It's been a delight to meet you. You don't have to go, Mother. But we're clearly not welcome here. Of course you are. Mr Truscott. Mrs Powell, it's always a pleasure. Please don't go. It meant everything to me, inviting you and everyone, and I... I should have known not to drink. Not to try and cook... boeuf sodding bourguignon. Even with Lil I can't... I know I've always been, and always will be, a disappointment to you, Mrs Truscott. There's nothing I can do. Jeannie. No, Richie. Do what you want. Go back to wherever it is you go. Keep doing whatever it is you're doing. I love you but I can't live without... love. Oh, by the way, I see they're advertising for a new Head Of Department at Queen Mary's in St Albans. Thought I might try my luck. Mm. What do you say? Well, you certainly can't be in Mr Powell's shadow for ever, that's a definite. Are you ready, dear? Mm-hm. Shall we? Mrs Enderbury. (KNOCKING) Stay there. Jeannie? JEAN: I can't pretend to be someone I'm not. And Richard can't pretend to care for me, I suppose. I think he does, you know. You're just saying what I want to hear. No. Because...he doesn't know how to show you what he feels. But that woman. I suspect there's a lot of your husband pretending not to feel what he really feels. Mrs J - Where's Mrs Powell? When did she say she'd be home? At eleven. She was dining with Mr and Mrs Truscott. It's...after midnight. I'm sure she's on her way. Perhaps the party was more fun than we might imagine. Well, good night. Go home. I'll wait up. (BIG BEN CHIMING) Let me have the statements and the photographs. Please. You promised. But I'll lose you if I give them to you. Please. I'll lose you, Elizabeth. Will you please meet your friend... ..Mrs Charles Enderbury. Your husband's accomplice. You're Margaret Dalton. You know Richard. - I do. - She's my patient, Mr Truscott. ..nothing wrong in your theatre and you can do whatever you want with us. How long have I got? If you breathe my name to him... ..and his charmed life is over. And yours. And Thomas's. - What are you hiding? - I can't tell you. Then we can't go any further. I need you to keep your promise to always protect him. And me.
