 We will be regaling our animation audience with the compelling story of the USS Indianapolis. The bloodiest, most grotesque shark tale in all of written history, and beyond. But here's the Shyamalan, we'll be telling this whole tale from the point of view of the ravenous man-eaters themselves. I'll send your waiter over. So, no notes. What do you think of that? Bruce, [stutters] I think I have to bow out of this project. I don't really understand what it is, and my plate is really full right now.

 Oh, shame on me, going on about my passion project. I'm completely neglecting my passion person. So tell me, how are you, my sweet, my lovely desert flower? It's a little crazy. One of the pugs, he ripped his bee costume. And then... I have an appointment with my life coach, and... I still need to get in a nap before my set tonight. -I was gonna say you look tired. -I do? I don't know. Do you? I don't know. [stammers] You said it. I wasn't listening to the thing I was saying. I don't wanna get overwhelmed again. You can't. You're right.

 -You've gotta slow down. -Am I going too fast? Everything's moving fast. I can't keep track of anything. I'm getting scared, Maria. This is what I was worried about. I can't get back on that Hollywood hamster wheel. Getting sick again. We can't afford to have you slip back to those depths from which you emerged. I better just go. Yes. You go do you. [theme music playing] [Maria] I'm a pterodactyl. [Maria] Do I seem tired? Do I seem... sort of overworked... like, overwhelmed? Doing too much? Am I talking too fast? [inhales deeply] [slowly] Am I talking too fast? Whoa, whoa. Okay. You're an artist, right? Do you know what these Hollywood fuck-faces want? They want to feed on your soul, okay? They're goddamn sexy vampires. They wanna Twilight the shit out of your jugular. That's just what they wanna do. But you know what? I'm on Team Maria. So I say, "Nuh-uh, you go and fuck yourself. You go and fuck your wolf faces." You know? Because you know who never gets tired? And you know who never does talk too fast? -Who? -Wolves. So I-- I should be more like a wolf? -Growl for me. -[growling] No. Please stop. Stop it. Stop it. You could've said no, and you didn't. -So you're not a wolf, okay? -Interesting. You should see someone about this. -Okay. -A specialist. -Great. -And I want to say upfront you're going to want to fuck him. He's very handsome. He's very rugged. He's very sexually generous. He's Karl Grisham, and he is my twin brother. Oh. So is-- Is he a psychiatrist? Absolutely not. Okay. Well, here's your dog. Mmm-mmm, not mine. You could leave it on the desk, and I'll find it some fruit. Maybe I'll take it with me. I'll just take her. Okay. [doorbell rings] Hey, you found my dog! -Aw, look at this little lady. -Okay. [Karl laughing] Cute. Listen, I know the reward said 500 bucks, but... what are you gonna do, keep my dog? You'd be a total asshole. Here's five bucks. No. Your sister sent me. I have an appointment. My sister, huh? What's she wearing today? -What? -Nothing. Sorry. Come on in. -So are you a life coach, or-- -Oh. No. Quite the opposite, actually. Okay. Oh, a death coach? Well, yeah. The death of productivity. [sighs] I'm a loaf coach. -[groans] Pull up a chair. -Oh... Okay. So what's been going on? Well, I'm just worried about triggering my bipolar mania. Getting a little busier, and I'm not sure how much is too much, you know? Let's unwrap and enjoy a stick of butter together. Okay. Huh. [slurping] I'm sorry, what is a loaf coach? -Oh. I'm gonna tell you a story. -Oh. [Karl] Early to bed, early to rise... makes a man healthy, wealthy... and crazy. The industrial age ruined everything, Maria. This idea that we can get things done faster ruined everything. It ruined all trades. -It ruined the art of conversation. -[horse neighs] You know who's to blame? Ben Franklin. Hi, guys. [whooshing] The guy with the electricity? Yeah, and the condescending glasses. He didn't even need those. They were for show. He was the original hipster fraud. Think about it. He put buckles on his shoes? That ludicrous hairstyle? And the experiments with the fuckin' kites and everything? Fuck you, Ben Franklin. Eat a dick. Here's how this is gonna go down. I'm gonna shadow loaf you for 10 days. -It sounds like... -[slurping] you got a solid program, and I wanna follow through with it. I used to think more was more. But now, I realize, less... is more of what I need. [chuckles] You know? [gasps] Sorry. I trained my body to sleep with my eyes open. I call it Grisham Cryosleep. [inhales deeply] -Feels like we're done, right? -Right. This was a good first sesh. -[exhales] -Well done, Maria. -Thank you. -[chuckles] [Maria] This loafing thing felt good. I have a history of pushing myself a little too hard. [Maria yawns] Hi, guys. Oh, boy. "Follow the rose petals to a super surprise." Okay. So many rose petals. Too much. Too soon. [shuddering] Good mornin', babe. Oh... Look, an omelet bar. Wow. You sure got the rose petals in there. You're darn right I did. That's feta cheese and rose petal. -The kids get in tomorrow. -Okay. Great. You're okay with them stayin'? Yes! I don't at all feel unnerved. I love kids and their faces and skins. I'm gonna get someone to hang out with them since I have to work. Tell that person they are gonna have to hang out with me, too. Because I'm spending all day with your children. -Really? -Yeah. Yeah. -You don't have to. -I do have to, because I love being busy with kids. Have them bring friends. Have their friends bring friends. You know what, can you excuse me a moment? [muffled screaming] Maria, your kids are here. We dropped them at craft services. I need you to sign your SAG paperwork. Okay, great. I didn't know you had kids. Well, they aren't mine. They are my boyfriend/tenant's. But I treat them like mine. I adore them. Uh, did they say their names? I'm sorry about the sweat. I just-- My hands get sweaty when I'm around kids, 'cause I love them. It's innate within me to love children. I love them. I'm a mother. Really, like a mother-- Do you think Checklist is unethical? Do you think what I'm doing is wrong? I AD'd a Mexican snuff movie, so I'm not the one to ask. You're wearing a microphone. Oh. Yep. Got it. Okay, I have eyes on her right now. We'd like to invite you to set. Do you have a towel or something... Maybe I could wipe my hands on your hair? -Absolutely. -Okay. Great. Okay, great. And picture's up! [Maria] I love Checklist! -[jingle playing] -♪ When you shop, you shop ♪ ♪ We're your one-stop shop ♪ ♪ We're your cradle-to-grave store ♪ ♪ When you shop, you shop ♪ Buy more! Do more! Be more! I got everything on my list. My checklist. Cradle, check. Grave, check! -[screams] -Call the medic! I'm so sorry. -I'm so sorry. -Come here. Extras are so goddamn annoying. [Karen] Don't make eye contact. That's gonna encourage him. Extras don't feel pain. That's why they call them background. -Well... -[cell phone vibrating] I gotta take this. It's my groomer. My dog's having his anal glands expressed. Poor baby. You know what, though? It reminds me of what's really important... Oh, mother fuck me! There's blood on my Louboutins. Can you believe this shit? At least the sole is red. Good God. Go for Grisham. -How are the glands? -[boy] Mommy! [distorted] Mommy! Mommy! What are we going to do today? Well, uh, hello, little ones... Well, just hold on for one sweet little second. [exclaiming] [muffled screaming] [Maria] It was a tough start, but I was determined to show these kids the best day ever. We had the best day ever! [panting] They haven't been to Build-A-Bear in, like, ten years. Yeah. Uh-huh. Dad, is it cool if I work on my essay for Wesleyan? [Graham] Absolutely, buddy. Yeah, we're also gonna do some stuff away from this room. -[Graham] Sounds great. -Love you. Thanks for the wonderful day, Maria. It was super, super fun. -You're a nice lady, too. -Mmm. [stammering] They seemed so much smaller on the rides. You didn't have to do that. No, it was $4,000 well spent. I mean, it's just paper. Where else am I gonna spend it? On adult things, like books, medicine and shelter? No, thanks! You know what? This is for me, I gotta get this. It's show business calling. [imitates ringing] Hello? Yes? Oh, New York City? Oh, my gosh. Oh, wait... Tina Fey? No. Right away? No. No, right away? No. I've got children here. My-- My children. One shot only. Oh, I guess I have to do it. Later. You will not believe this, Graham. I just got a gig in New York City, and I have to leave right away. Uh, I know. I know. I'm as peeved about it as you are. Okay. See you Monday. Aren't you gonna pack anything? Graham, it's New York! [laughs] I didn't go to New York. I went a quarter of a mile from home. I just needed some me time. [muffled crying] The next morning, I felt like I had gone to New York. I felt sophisticated, cosmopolitan. I was a woman in charge of my world. [cell phone vibrating] Hey. [Graham] Maria, I know you're in New York right now. Sorry, I'm on the set of Dinosaur Priest. I know you're in New York working, but we need to talk. I think we're moving too fast. Maybe I made a big mistake, bringing the kids to LA. That thing you said about being their mom. I love it, but... [stammering] maybe it's too much, too soon. I think we should slow down. I should move out, and we should take a break. Graham, I'm looking at the skyline in New York, where I am... and I just think... how much time on this kooky blue marble called Earth do we have? Tomorrow is guaranteed to no one. You say go slower, I say move faster. Graham, will you marry me? Oh, my God. Yes! [chuckles] Yes. [laughing] Hold on. Tina Fey's on the other line. [beeps] [muffled screaming] So, I overcommitted in the past. That's why now I was determined to master the art of doing nothing. [rock song playing] ♪ Every day we're faced With a million decisions ♪ ♪ People say to just make one ♪ ♪ But I'll do you one better When it comes to decisions ♪ ♪ I say, "Fuck decisions, make none" ♪ ♪ You've got to loaf You've got to loaf ♪ ♪ 'Cause working is for pussies And trying is for chumps ♪ ♪ You've got to loaf You better loaf ♪ ♪ The only way to win at life Is to just give up ♪ Look, I love your enthusiasm. But as a fan of Jungian motifs, you need to dig down to the shadow side of the protagonist. John Truby. I took the Truby screenwriting seminar in Del Mar. You didn't retain much. Trust your inner voice. Let that be the music of your song. I gotta go. Thank you, Rafael. "Trust your inner voice. Let that be the music of your song." Yeah. Yeah. [Karl sighs] How you feeling? Relaxed? Very relaxed, almost depressed. Then it's workin'. Soon, I'm gonna introduce you to an involuntary catheter. -Hmm. -[cell phone vibrating] -Oh. -Ugh, enough with that thing. [gasps] It's Judd Apatow, super producer. [Karl] Ugh. [Maria] He never calls me. I could blow off Bruce, but this is Judd Apatow, the "A" man. The Apatow for destruction. The tow truck. My Judd bud. Paul Rudd's Judd. The fourth Judd. The... the Return of the Juddi. A person whose support I treasure, as a champion of women in comedy, and of comedy in general. Mmm. He's gone to voicemail. Yeah, good. -[inhales deeply] -[sighs] -[cell phone vibrating] -He's calling back! That's why he is the Juddernaut! All right, put it on the box. Hello? Hey, Maria, it's Judd callin'. -What's up? -Uh, nothing. -Nothing at all. -Right. Well, I'm doing a new movie, and I wrote a part in it just for you. You know that you called Maria Bamford, right? Maria, you're doing that thing again. -What thing? -That thing where you diminish yourself as a person and artist, 'cause you're afraid to accept that you have a unique and singular voice. Oh, that thing. I'm gonna tell you about the movie. It's a double crossover sequel of Bridesmaids and Ghostbusters. Feig is in, and it is called... Bridebusters? Actually, no. We never thought of that. Write that down, "Brides... busters." No. We're gonna go Ghostmaids. Ghostmaids. Okay, here's the thing. We've already got Melissa McCarthy, Wiig, Schumer, and, in kind of a large supporting part, Nancy Reagan. -Oh... -So, what do you say? -You wanna make a movie? -[mouthing] No. [whispering] Why not? Do you know how much work this will lead to? Definite pass. No way. But it's a big movie with stars. Sometimes you have to say no to the best when you need the rest. [sighs] Goddamn it. Judd, I can't do it. Give the part to a charity. Like the downtown women's center. I can't give a job to a downtown women's center, 'cause it's an acting role for a person. Are you freaking out again? No. I'm healthier than I've ever been. Maybe go to her house with some zinc lozenges and some old Mike Douglas DVDs. The ones with Totie Fields she likes. Church is gonna come over and follow up, okay? No. You're the best. I need the rest. Thank you so much for thinking of me. I treasure you, and I love you so very much. Buh-bye! -Maria, don't! Stop thinking, plea-- -Oh, God. Ugh. See, that wasn't hard. How do you feel? Deflated. Yeah. You know what deflation is? Ambition just leaving your body. [sighs] Oh, it's so good to feel free from success. [chuckles] [Maria] I grew up in a family that was obsessed with being productive. While I was recovering at home, my mother made me mentor a young comic. So, Maria, I watched your stand-up, and it was, like... it wasn't funny. That's wonderful feedback. What kind of comedy do you like to do? So, I like to change the words to Katy Perry songs. So, here's one. Mr. Sherman's such a jerk. He always gives us homework. Work, work, work. Oh. Okay, that's fun. All my friends say I'm so hilarious. And one time, I ate dog food at a party. Sorry to interrupt, hons. Your father and I were cleaning out the attic. Not a euphemism. And look what we found... your violin. Play it and see if it still works. Mom, I hate that violin. Please burn it. Oh, Kristy, she played so beautifully when she was just about your age. Won all the competitions. Come on, play it for Kristy. No, Mom... no violin. Oh, this one. [sighs] You'd think we held a gun to her head. All right, fine, I'll play it. Here are two of the world's smallest violins, playing just for you. [Maria] Oh. That's not the gesture you think it is, Mom. Oh, I can't do anything right. Ugh. Moms, right? -They're the worst. -The total worst. So, your mom said that you wanted to, um... -prepare for some contest at school? -Yeah. The winner gets an Applebee's gift card and is principal for the day. -I'm gonna make everyone eat dog food. -[Maria] Doesn't it annoy you that your mom is making you sit here with me? It's super annoying. And she cut down my allowance, because we're, "barely scraping by." What a bitch. How would you like to stick it to your mom and all the other moms out there who are forcing their kids to do stuff they don't wanna do? Like, for example, play the violin. I would love it. When I am done with you, you are gonna have 20 tons of comedy napalm to drop on Mrs. Coombs, or whatever name your mom is calling herself by these days. Kablam! [imitates explosion] Take that, motherfucker! I love it. Send me that material? Yes, yes. Goddamn it, she's funny. Maria, hon, hi. Candy Coombs, Kristy's mom. [laughing] Oh, hi, Mrs. Coombs. Your mom went to the cellar to grab some white wine. Mmm. We're celebrating. Kristy won her comedy contest. Oh, yeah. In your face, Mrs. Coombs! I brought you a gift for helping mentor Kristy to victory. Hmm? It's candy. -[groans] -Like my name. [chuckles] Candy. Yeah, I get it. [scoffs] It means the world that you were willing to help mentor Kristy. Between you and me, I don't know how much time I have left for Kristy. Oh, really? Not much time left for your child? Six months if I'm lucky. I'm dying of pancreatic cancer. [gasps] Yeah. I haven't told Kristy yet. -[wheezing] -It's stage four. [chuckles] Which is funny. That's the stage she performed on last night. The reason I was pushing for you to get involved is that I wanted to give Kristy a win before I die, and she loses everything. We're having some pretty serious money trouble. And I have no insurance. [sighs] I couldn't afford it after her father shot himself. [chuckles] Oh, no. You must hate me. I helped your daughter develop an act that was very critical. Watching that must've really hurt. Not really. I injected painkillers into my abdomen so I could sit upright during her set. Oh, my God. Yeah, Kristy ripped me a new one. [both sigh] -But... that's okay. -[groans] As long as she gets the victory, I can take the hit. Because that's what moms do. [clicks tongue] -[Candy groans] -[Marilyn] Hey, Maria, you wanna join us? I'm just gonna pull some sausage from the meat raffle out of the freezer. [sobs] I'm not worthy! Of freezer sausage? Somebody's getting their pyramid. [Maria playing violin] Oh, Maria, the violin. You still play like an angel. Mom, I wanted to tell you something. I haven't always been the easiest, and I just appreciate everything that you've done, and everything that I know you'll continue to do. And... I, uh... Thank you for taking all the hits all these years. Oh, you're welcome, honey. You're welcome. [sniffles] Do you wanna burn that thing? Yes. Yes. Okay, let's go out back to the trash can and torch it hobo style. [laughing] Yeah. We'll get some of your dad's gayer shirts, -and we'll destroy them too. -Oh, great. -[Marilyn] Which ones do you wanna pick? -Well, that one that's orange plaid... -[Karl grunts] -[cell phone chimes] -[Maria groaning] -Oh, shit! -I gotta go to Phoenix. -Why you gotta go to Phoenix? -'Cause he's in Paris. -What? Joaquin Phoenix. He needs my help in Paris. -Paris Hilton? -What? Maria, don't be gross. He's having a total mid-loaf crisis. [chuckles] Needs my help. Time to pay the bills, know what I mean? You specifically said not to pay the bills. I was being metaphorical, Maria. Everybody has to pay their bills. In fact, you owe me $10,000. -[gasps] -[cell phone chimes] Ooh! That's my Uber. Okay. [Karl] Keep doing this until I get back. -You're doing great. -No, no. No, no, no, no. [gasps] Judd! [crying] Oh... Loaf legs! [continues crying] Judd, wait! -Maria. -Yeah. [stammers] I told you not to come here without asking. -Okay. -You have to call ahead. Yes. -Ooh, but I'm here. -You are. Is there something you need? I was wrong. I was, uh... just doing a bit when I said no. 'Cause, I-- I love comedy. You love comedy. Let's... let's work together. [exclaims] [sighs] I have bad news. -No. -I just gave the part to Sarah Silverman, like, 13 seconds ago. No! [inhales] Oh, she's so good. Okay. -So good. -Okay. Couldn't you just call... takebacksies, Judd? -Here's the thing. -Yes. -I hate to say this. -Yeah. In this business... there are no takebacksies. [gasping] I did that a couple of years ago... and I got fucked. [softly] I don't wanna get fucked. You are a man of honor, and I will fix this. I will fix it! ...came out of the pool, and he was completely dry. No way. Hey, you guys. I was just in the neighborhood. It's so crazy. You look so pretty, Sarah. So do you, Tig. Um... I heard you are in the new Judd movie. So cool. Hey, I was just wondering, could I have the part? Because you have everything. You have a hot English boyfriend. You're Jewish, which is so cool. And I was just thinking, I need the part. I really need it. I'll make you a deal. Find all 25 items on that 25-item scavenger hunt list in two hours, the part's yours. [gasps] Okay, thank you, so... Why do you have a scavenger hunt list just lying around? Maria, I'm high all the time, what am I supposed to do? Yeah, I'm totally high right now. Just hanging out. I don't even have a line in this scene. Okay. Clock time starts... now! Whoa! Hedge! Okay... okay, this doesn't count! Start the clock now! I'm doing this for a scavenger hunt. -Just kidding! I'm a cop. -Whoa. Good job. Thank you. [straining] [both grunting] -[Maria panting] -[donkey braying] I did it. I got all the items on the list, Sarah. Samesies, Tig. Holy shit, Maria, I was kidding. -[laughing] -I was doing my patented Sarah Silverman deadpan, you know, "you can't tell if I'm being real or not" thing. Oh, you bitches! -[continues laughing] -Maria, you can have the part. I don't need it. I'm a female comedian, AKA a billionaire, right, Tig? Yeah, we're all very rich. Wait, are you doing your patented deadpan thing again? [cell phone dialing] Judd, Silverdog. I'm out of the movie. Hold on. All yours, babe. Judd! [stammers] Judd? [whispers] Thank you, Sarah. Judd, it's Maria. Yes, Sarah doesn't wanna do it. 8:00 a.m. table read. Okay, I'll be there. I love you so much! Thank you so much, Sarah. Thank you. I owe you forever. God... I started out, I got a loaf coach, thinking I needed to slow down. Now I realize I needed to learn how to take care of myself, you know, to be a mother to me. [braying] -[panting] May I? May I? -Of course. [Maria] Thank you. See you mothers later! Whoa! Hedge! -Edit this out! -[donkey braying] No! I missed the table read. Oh, I'm a failure. [Bert] Stop, Maria. You may have failed to attend the table read, but you succeeded in something of far greater importance. You mothered yourself, and now you are rested. Even though fair Judd will never take your calls again, take this as a victory. A victory. [chuckles] I am rested. I think I finally know what I'm doing. [choir singing] ♪ I don't know what I'm doing ♪ ♪ More than half of the time ♪ Ready, guys? This is Bruce Ben-Bacharach. Chums Ahoy. Laying down take number one.
