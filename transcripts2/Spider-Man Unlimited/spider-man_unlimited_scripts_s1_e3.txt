 The name's not guinea pig, man, it's Spider-Man. Stop him, my knights. He must not escape. We were sent here to rescue you. The human fools are leading me to their secret headquarters. Dr. Jameson, I presume. The High Evolutionary's enforcers. I came here to rescue you. I'm not going back until the humans here are free of the High Evolutionary's oppression. Just my luck, my kid gets saved by a transient. -I could use a place to stay. -It's free for two weeks.

 Huh? [screaming] It's been more than two weeks, Peter. I'm sorry, but you've got to bring in some money. I can't keep subsidizing you. My medical clinic hardly pays for itself. Not to worry, Naoko. Check this out. I'm a photographer. This is right up my alley. I need a boarder with a steady paycheck. -A job. -This is my job. I used to make a living doing this. Well, more or less. But, Peter, you have no idea where this Spider-Man will show up.

 It's like trying to win the lottery. If you'd just give me a chance tonight. Stop fighting! What was that about? Uh, he's probably remembering the fights his father and I used to have. I'm sorry. It's my fault. I'll go find him. I'll talk to him. No. I'll do it. He won't get far. I'll be back soon. Look, Peter, I like you, but the wolf isn't just at the door. He's already cleaned out the pantry. Way to go, Parker. She's trying to raise a son and run a medical clinic, single-handedly. All she needs is some off-world moocher like you, and you just let her go out in the middle of the night alone to find her son. [tracker beeping] [cat meows] Shane? [tracker beeping] Shane? Come back. Shane? Shane. It's OK, baby. Look, Peter and I aren't mad at each other, honey. We were just having a discussion. [screams] Aah! Aah! Let me go! -Uh, Mom! Mom! -Aah! Aah! [grunts] Mom! Mom! [struggling] Shane, get out of here! -No! -Uh! Shane, run! Naoko! Shane, what's wrong? It-it took her. It took my mom. OK, OK, calm down. What took her? The-the green thing. It took her. The green thing! [theme music playing] Lock all the doors and stay here. Don't let anyone in. I'll find your mom. I promise. [tracker beeping] Shane said the green thing took her. [gasps] Uh-oh, spider sense. Incoming! Goblin, what are you doing here? I don't recall meeting you before, Arachnid. And what I am doing is protecting the innocent from criminal scum like you and your symbiote friends. You must be the local version. Not the guy I know. What have you done with Naoko, Dr. Yamata Jones? What are you talking about? What has happened to her? I have a witness who says a green thing grabbed her. That would be you. It's not easy being green, but your witness is wrong. This area is my personal protectorate. I patrol it every night. Who died and made you superhero in residence? Far too many, wall-crawler. Somebody has to stop scum like you. It's why I get up in the morning. I'm not one of the bad guys. The name is Spider-Man. Right, you're not with Venom and Carnage. You're a completely unrelated superpower guy in a spider suit. You can think I am stupid, Spider-Man. Just don't talk to me like I am stupid. Gas! [coughing] At least, you're perceptive. Now, spider-sap, let's see who you really are under that mask. Aah! Speaking of my mask, did I mention, it's the new improved deluxe version, complete with osmotic gas filter? OK, smiley, where is she? Aah! I honestly don't know, but if she is missing, I'll find her... without your help. Time we made a choice. We can keep fighting each other, or we can fight them. Masked vigilantes are prohibited in the five boroughs and parts of Upper Staten Island. Surrender now! These guys never learn, do they? It's been a long time. What if Peter can't find her? After all, he doesn't have her tracer. I do. I'll find you, Mom. I promise. [struggling] Aah! [grunts] [grunting continues] OK, maybe I made a mistake about you. The jury's still out on you, pal. But I know these guys aren't my friends. Surrender. I don't think so! Hey, arrest this guy. He's the one violating the litter laws. [crash] Ha-ha! I think maybe you upset them. And people say I'm perceptive. This may be a mistake. -Mom! -Shane? Mom! What does that kid think he's doing? Hey, that's not the way to help him. You'll just get flash-fried. Flash-fried? Yes, indeed. She went down the sewer? Uh-oh! Machine men. Ha-ha! Cover your eyes. -Danger! -It worked. The flash fried their optic sensors. We're safe now. Danger. Enemy sighting. Target acquired. Aah! Whew! Interesting definition of safe. Where is Shane? He went down into the sewers. Then that's where I'm going. Oh, no. Not alone, you're not. I still trust you about as far as I can throw you one-handed, Goblin. And I'm just as concerned about Shane as you are. Somehow, I doubt that. Shane, where are you? My spider sense is tingling. Your what is doing what? Just trust me. There's danger here. The only danger we're in down here is breathing ourselves to death. Catch you later. Goblin, look out! Behind you! Aah! Booger at twelve o'clock! Don't you mean bogey? I don't think so. Time for pre-boarding. Buckle your seat-belt. Um, would you say these tentacles are green? A kind of mottled chartreuse. But, yes, definitely green. Think that was what your witness saw? OK, I guess I misjudged you. But what is this thing we're fighting? Any idea? Never seen anything like it, but then, I don't hang out a lot in the sewers. -Aah! -Aah! -Boom! -Aah! [struggling] Aah! Let me go! Hey! Get your hands off me! Well, well! A celebrity among tonight's volunteers. Welcome, Dr. Yamata Jones. I thought all these chambers were destroyed. That's what we wanted people to think. The synoptic survives and prospers, as you can see. Soon, we will have an army of symbiotes. Our "volunteers" will help us establish a new world order. [struggling] One in which the symbiotes, not the humans, not the bestials, not even the High Evolutionary, rule! The destiny of this world and all who dwell upon it was sealed countless millennia ago when our kind first arrived. We were the dominant life form of this planet. For millions of years, all lived in the harmony of the group mind. Our peace was shattered by the cataclysm, which drove our kind from the surface where the individual joined the all and the all lay dormant for untold centuries, waiting patiently for us, its liberators, to arrive. And now, the group mind shall triumph, transforming this planet into... [laughs] our kind of place. No! You can't! Sure, I can. Watch how easy it is. Like it or not, doctor... you're about to become part of the family. [moans] -Shane! -Hey, you're that Spider-Man. Please don't hurt me. I have to find my mom. I won't hurt you. You're Peter Parker's friend, right? Yes. You know Peter? Where is he? Is he all right? He's-he's safe. He sent me down here to look for your mom. He told me you were supposed to stay in your apartment. Uh, well, yeah, but I had to go look for my mom. I've got her tracker. See. I forgot to give it to Peter. This will help. Good job, Shane. I should take you home, but I think maybe we'd better hurry and find your mom. You'll be safe if you stick with me. -Deal? -Deal. Guess there's only one thing to do. It's dangerous, but the fate of the world depends on it. I've got to do what no other superhero on the planet would even consider. Ooh, it's drafty in here. [Naoko] Stay away from me! I'm coming, Naoko. [crying] -Mom! -[crying] Spider-Man, you've got to stop them from hurting my mom. [crying] Aah! Don't let him near the biomass! Stop him! He won't get away this time. Shane! Not this time, sucker! Mom, I helped Spider-Man. He's Peter's friend. That figures. You got a bad habit of showing up where you're not wanted, Spider-Man. Yes. It's time that habit gets broken. Here's a song dedication to the symbiote slimeballs from your friendly interplanetary Spider-Man. Sonics on. We'll see your sonic weapon, Spider-Man, and raise you this. Oh, we're having fun now, aren't we? The sonics are drawing too much power. We need to wrap this up quick. I think we're OK for a while, or not. Hang on! You should be safe up here while I take care of the sludge brothers. This is not going to be my day. [struggling] Take heart! The cavalry has arrived! What, the fashion cavalry? Nice outfit, Goblin. Now, get everybody out of here. I've got a plan. Ha-ha! Wait! What about Spider-Man? The man says he has a plan. Who am I to doubt him? [crowd shouting] What's going on? Get me out of here! [groaning] You've troubled us for the last time, web-head! You are history! Come on! You can do this! History was never my best subject. I prefer Phys Ed.! [screaming] [Venom growling] At least the Goblin got Naoko and Shane out. -Going up? -Yes, please. Push the penthouse button, would you? [screaming] [siren wailing] Thank you for saving us, Goblin. It's my job. Glad I could help. I'd better take Shane home. Let me add my thanks to his. You're a real hero, Goblin. Hey, where's Spider-Man? I wanted to thank him, too. He swung away on his web when we got out of the sewers. Oh! If you see him, tell him thanks as well. And since he and Peter Parker are such good friends, tell him that Peter better pay his rent, today. Mom! I hope we see you again. I hope so, too, my love. Man, I don't get enough time to do this. Just work out the kinks like I used to back on Earth. Not to mention make some bucks, so I can pay the rent. [snap] No! Yes! Now to claim my 5000 bucks. Yeah, OK, they're pictures of Spider-Man, all right. Oh, I'll tell you what, this is going to break me, but I'll give you 50 bucks apiece for them, huh? Your ad said 5000. Hah! Don't believe everything you read, kid. All right, 100 bucks apiece. Final offer. Mr. Mineo, do you mind if I call you JJ? -What are you talking about? -Uh, nothing. Never mind. Oh, can I have that in cash? I got the rent. Sorry, it took so long. Thanks, and I'm sorry, too. I should have trusted you to make good on your promise. Shane told me what you did. Thank you for sending Spider-Man after me. Ah, shucks, ma'am, 'tweren't nothing. [chuckles] You know, you might not be such a bad tenant after all.
