 [Spider-Man] Almost daylight, and I still can't find Jameson. He ran off while we were talking and I haven't seen him since. The thing is, none of the other rebels seem to know where he went, either. Ah, well, if I got to be up, there's nothing like good news to start the morning. Bad news to spoil it. [growling]

 Mom, what's going on? Get back to bed, Shane. Now! [roars] Hope you've got a good supply of glue. [howls] [Spider-Man] Hey, you might want to take something for that throat condition. Cherry or menthol? [roars] Over here, fuzzy! I don't like seeing my friends mistreated. Maybe you need a lesson in manners. Spider-Man, no! -What? -[Naoko] Don't hurt him. Him? What about me?

Not into the vegan lifestyle? [roars] [inaudible speaking] -[growls] -Ah! Nice move, webhead. Now you know what a wrecking ball feels like. -[gasps] -[growling] Ah! Spider-Man, it'll be all right. If you can just hold him off a little longer. [grunts] A-A little longer? Whose side are you on? [growling] [groaning] Jameson? Afraid so, webslinger. Afraid so. I've been treating him for several weeks. He came in early this morning suffering from convulsions. Before I could help him, he changed into that man-wolf you saw. [breathing] Did I hurt anyone? Is Shane OK? Don't worry, John. He's fine. He's safe upstairs. How did this happen? That's not something I even like thinking about. Pardon the pun, John John, but if the cat's not out of the bag, the wolf sure is. When I first came here, the High Evolutionary stuck me in his lab and put me through a battery of experimental procedures. Turns out they were the preliminary stages of bestial transformation. Apparently, his plan was to turn me into some kind of wolf creature. I was rescued before he could complete the process, but part of me remained a mindless animal. I sent some tissue samples to a biochemist colleague of mine. Apparently, the foreign DNA thrives when negative ions are absorbed through the skin. So, I created one of these. A bioelectrical implant. Right. It releases electrical pulses that fool the body into thinking it's being exposed to direct sunlight. As long as it's functioning properly, he can't transform. So what went wrong? Mmm, looks like a short. -Caused by? -Some kind of energy source. Looks like an electrical shock. Remember, it's a prototype. I've still got tests to run. So what do we do in the meantime? Put John boy in a padded room? Fortunately, I have replacements. [Shane] You OK, Mr. Jameson? A little tender, but I'll live. This is a heck of a predicament you're in, John John. What are your buddies in the movement going to think of you being an undercover bestial? They can't know anything about this. They wouldn't understand. [firing] Spider-Man, we know you're in there. You are wanted for crimes against the state. Surrender immediately or face the consequences. Welcome to the fraternity, webslinger. Looks like you've got a price on your head, too. With my luck, I'll wind up in the bargain bin. Catch me if you can, tin man. And I thought chalk on a blackboard was bad. Further resistance will not be tolerated. Halt! Stop. Your orders have been superseded by authority of the knights of Wondergor. These suspects are now in my custody. Return to your station immediately. Great. Are you the frying pan or the fire? I am neither, but once I was known as X-51. Hey, the old rust bucket himself. Like the trendy new look. He's working with us now. We kludged together some exo-armor, slapped it on... And now, I am better than new, But the subterfuge will not last long. We must go before the authorities return. Sounds like a plan. Lead the way. [Bromely] Blimey! Every time I look at the download from X-51's original memory storage, I find something new. A harness fusion power plant. That monstrosity taps into a natural fusion core and lets enough radiation spill into the basement's water system to destroy half the city's human population within a few years. All in the name of powering the upper world. Shutting the place down will be a pleasure. There's a small problem, love. Getting past the usual assortment of security measures is one thing, but the main power switch -is located just inside this room. -[beeping] And roving laser sentries make it impossible to reach without getting your bum fried. Even you. What if we found someone who can walk on the ceiling, someone with good enough reflexes to avoid the sensors? I assume you mean Spider-Man. The bloke hasn't exactly warmed to our cause. [beeping] [Karen] Security breach! [John] Good work re-coding those alarms. John, you're back. And you brought Spider-Man. Hey, I found him. Where's my hug? I've got something better. Karen's right, the only one who can get to that power switch is you. With the plant offline, the High Evolutionary won't have a choice. He'll have to negotiate with us. I got to level with you, John John. The longer I stay here, the more I understand your passion for ending the New World Order. But I'm a solo act. Keep traveling your lonely road. Ignore the millions of human lives that are at stake here. Well... since you put it that way... Talk about your rag-tag armies... These guys don't even have a marching song. Things I get into just because for a minute there Karen reminded me of MJ. There's our target. [thud] [beeping] Look, I know you got the inside scoop from X-51, but my spider-sense is on overdrive. You have entered a restricted area. Surrender now or face immediate termination. Uh, gang, I hate to break it to you, but we've lost the element of surprise. Halt. Your orders have been superseded by authority of the Knights of Wundagore. These humans are my prisoners. Return to your station immediately. Negative. Our central processor has deemed your orders invalid. I knew we couldn't get away with that one twice. Step aside or face termination. [grunting] We've got work to do. This way. Hey, is it me, or did the whole concept of "All for one and one for all" just take a nose-dive? This you call a power plant? What did Bromely use to decrypt that data, a decoder ring? [groaning] [beeping] Sensors are jammed. We're in business. Great wheels, John boy, but I didn't sign on for a joy ride. The power plant's our next stop. While the firefight keeps the High Evolutionary's forces occupied, we'll be halfway across town pulling the plug. We didn't fill you in because this is a military mission. Everything's strictly need-to-know. [Spider-Man] Confidentially, colonel, I've got a few needs of my own. This tracker is calibrated to the master switch's electrical frequency. I get it. Just follow the bouncing ball, and I'm home free. Here it goes. Remind me to compliment Git on his counterfeiting abilities. No sign of any guards. So why doesn't that make me feel better? [beeping] Master switch, here I come. Well, cute little guys. If you got a thing for flies. -[beeping] -The communications room is up one level. Even the Easter bunny couldn't keep up this hopping forever. Now, if I can just remember the sequence Bromely showed me. -You're hurt. -I'll survive. Let's keep moving. [beeping] [Bromely] Way to go, boys! Way to go! [laughs] [all gasp] That'll teach them to tangle with the old web meister. Uh-oh, spidey, you spoke too soon. You did a bad, bad thing. Electro? You know me? Well, sort of, but compared to you, the Electro I know looks like a movie star. [laughs] You'll have to do better than that. Auxiliary power. That should run the basic internal systems. [beeping] [groans] The disc with our demands. Start transmitting them to the High Evolutionary. -[beeping] -Is that what I think it is? This guy definitely wasn't in the specs. I hate these security surprises. [groaning] [beeping] [groans] Pathetic. Always I hope for a challenge. But destiny won't allow it. Destiny? Where's he hiding? Ah, come on, fighting one at a time is tough enough. John! What is the meaning of this outrage? What's it look like, big shot? We just shut you down. Your muscles weaken, but my electricity constantly replenishes. That's how I know that someday I will face bigger and better things. Listen, pal, if you want to skip this stage and go right to the next level, that's fine by me. You humans think this pitiful attempt at rebellion will change anything? We sure hope so. Unless our demands are met, half of New York state's going to stay shut down. Demands? No one makes demands of the Creator, Certainly not humans! [grunting] [growling] Ah! So this is what it feels like to be a bull's-eye. Once I get the city back online, the Creator will have to give me the ultimate reward. A place with the Knights of Wundagore. The waste from this plant offends you? You think you deserve something better? If humans must suffer to preserve the sanctity of my kingdom, then so be it. That is a sacrifice the High Evolutionary is willing to make. You're willing? What about us? [growling] John? [roars] Got to stop Electro from turning the power back on. Destiny or no destiny. [Electro] Better, but still not good enough. I don't want to have to use this, John. [growls] No! [Spider-Man] Ya! [growling] Your implant must have shorted out again. Shutting the power down probably created enough negative ions to grow hair on The Chrysler Building. [roars] [groans] Ah! It's sparky you want, not me! Your friend looks hungry. Think he'd like a barbecued snack? Sorry, squiggy, but I'm turning off your burner permanently. No! I'm overloading! [groans] The siphon core's going to blow! We've got to get out of here. Ah! [gasps] [Spider-Man] Good doggy. Here, boy. Here. [growling] [growling] Sorry, fuzzy, but this is going to hurt you more than it does me. Hope you can drive this thing, 'cause somebody's got to get us out of here before this whole place melts down. [growling] [groaning] [gasps] Hah! [John exhales] Karen, I know what you must be thinking. The leader of the rebels part bestial. Hush, John. Get some rest. We'll all be happy knowing that power plant is history, and its radiation sealed off. I almost forgot, I found this data in the comm room. What is it, or is this need-to-know, too? It's a way of saying thanks. The location of the ship you came in. It's what you've wanted, webslinger. Your ticket home. Home? Home. â™ª Spider-Man â™ª â™ª Spider-Man â™ª â™ª Spider-Man â™ª â™ª Spider-Man â™ª
