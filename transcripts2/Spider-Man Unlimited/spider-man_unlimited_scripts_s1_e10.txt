 [Spider-Man thinking] Baseball, the all-American pastime. [crowd cheering] I remember the last time Mary Jane and I went to a game. It was a three-hot-dog night. Hmm? I wonder what chili dogs are made of here on Counter-Earth. On second thought, Spidey, you don't want to know. It may have the name, but this game's not the same. [players grunting, shouting] [announcer] And Santino evens the score! [cheering continues] [Sir Ram] The humans are getting unruly.

 We should have them removed. Let them be, Ram. They're here to enjoy the game just as we are. Your tolerance of this subspecies is admirable, my lord, but is it wise? You're blocking my view. [John] Lord Tyger's in his box, all right. Never misses a game. Do you think we can convince him to come back to the basement with us? I don't know. But of all the Knights of Wundagore, he's always seemed our best shot at getting a fair shake from the High Evolutionary. Assuming we'd get past his bodyguards

 with our skulls still intact. [rattling] Better check that out. [door closes] -[beep] -Find anything? Charlie, you read me? [Karen] We don't want trouble. We just want to talk to Lord Tyger. You clear, Bromley? As a midsummer night's dream in London. Our friend's a bit foggy, however. Stay alert. We're going in. [beep] I see you're a fan, Lord Tyger. You dare! We don't want to hurt anyone. But we don't intend to get hurt, either. Lord Tyger, may we have a word with you? I don't know what you're up to, rebel, but you're interrupting my enjoyment of an important game. [grunts] [beeping] A flipping silent alarm! [grunts] Everyone, fall back! Aah! Let's go, men! [Men yell] Woah! Down the stairs! [groans] [grunts] [theme song playing] [Karen] Bromley! If they've got Bromley-- We'll do what we can later. Now move! [yells] The others got away, but we have this one. Enlighten me, rebel. What was the purpose of this futile foray? It is obvious that they were here for you. A kidnapping attempt. Kidnapping? Why, you... A ransom on your head would be quite attractive to these hooligans. It's fortunate I was able to foil their plot. Yes, I suppose it was. Dress his wound and place him under arrest. The High Evolutionary will want to know about this. [thinking] That fight I had with Venom really scrambled my suit's circuits. My sonics should be back online. Nothing like a little target practice to test the repairs. Sonics on. [mechanical humming] [yowls] Well, looks like I'm back in business. -[firework pops] -Did I do that? Fireworks? I almost forgot about the street carnival. Everyone say cheese. [chuckles] [Peter thinking] There's no getting past it. The longer I'm stuck on this planet, the more Shane and Naoko feel like family to me. If MJ weren't waiting for me back home... [laughs] Enough. Peter. There you go again, Parker, wondering about the forbidden fruit. Your assignment was to shoot the carnival, remember? I don't think the Daily Bite will be too thrilled by photos of Shane and me. They will if they have any taste. [chuckles] Hey, anyone want ice cream before we head home? I do, I do! Move it! Out of the way! -We don't need your kind around here! -[crowd shouting] Looks like trouble brewing. We could join in. We have business of our own. Once the young are reestablished in our new nest, this kind of trouble will look like a Sunday picnic. [shouting continues] We don't need your kind around here! Hey, what's going on over there? Nothing good, that's for sure. So much for family hour. Looks like Spidey will have to break up this party before it gets too wild. Somebody's gonna get hurt. Maybe we should-- Peter? Yeah! Come on! Come on! [shouting continues] Clear, humans. [Woman] We want our city back! [crowd clamoring, gasping] Somebody call for a referee? Take a hike, creep. This isn't your problem. Tsk, tsk. That's 10 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct, El Toro. Hit the bench. -Why does everything always have to get so complicated? -[Men groan] [Woman screaming] Time to blow this popsicle stand. [murmuring, crying] I can't believe Peter is such a coward, running off like that. He didn't run, Mom. He's just taking pictures. You'll see. This is your new headquarters? [chuckles] If you ask me, up isn't much of an improvement. As me mum always said, "Home is what you make of it, Danny boy." I hope you inherited her sense of humor. So where is everybody? This is how you welcome guests? [whirring] Now I know what a tuna fish feels like. Either X-51 just cloned himself, or these guys are the real McCoy. You are under arrest, Spider-Man. Do not resist. Definitely not the tin can we all know and love. [grunts] Aah! Uh! [footsteps approaching] Uh-uh. Spidey waffles are a definite no-no. Ooh. That's gotta hurt. Not nearly as much as this! Let's get outta here before more of these bad boys show up. I don't think so, Spider-Man. Aah! [grunts] Bromley? What-- Sorry, old man. [grunts] Nothing personal. [Shane] I'll bet that's Peter. -I hope so, kiddo. -[phone ringing] The way he disappears sometimes really makes me worried. -[phone ringing] -Hello? Hey, you're not Parker. Where's Parker? Who is this? The guy who signs his paychecks. He was supposed to have those street carnival photos on my desk over an hour ago. Where is the good-for-nothing? I've been wondering that myself. Well, the minute you lay eyes on him, tell Parker to get his keister over to the Byte pronto, or he can start looking for some other sucker to string along. The spider is awake. [groans] Awake? And here I thought I was in the middle of a nightmare filched from Franz Kafka. But I promise we won't disappoint, Spider-Man. How do you like my trap? I built it just for you. Fortunately, the rebels provided us with bait much sooner than I anticipated. Bromley? You set me up? But you hate these guys. Ah, Sir Ram, Lady Ursula. [both] Your Highness. Congratulations are in order, my Knights. And you, Mr. Bromley, have earned both my gratitude and your reward for proving my low opinion of humans so well-founded. Now, if you'll transport the prisoner to Wundagore, I can resume the experiments I started before Mr. Bromley's former friends whisked Spider-Man away. Bromley, you sold out? Why? What did they give you? Answer me! [Lady Ursula] Silence! Prepare Spider-Man for transport. Are you forgetting our agreement, Ursula? The creator will get his prisoner after I have made a few behavioral modifications. [beeps] [Spider-Man] This place is just full of surprises. With much more to come, Spider-Man. Once we're done here, you will be a puppet with your mind under my control. Why not just put me on the payroll like you did Bromley? You can accomplish the same thing. Take him inside. Consider this an honor, Spider-Man. You are about to become my secret weapon. Uh, couldn't I just sign a pledge? [laughing] I know how weak you humans are, so if you experience any pain, feel free to express yourself. The only words I've got are for Bromley, and he already knows what they are. It will be such a pleasure to silence you once and for all. [grunting] My brain feels like it's in a blender. [yells] God! Move! [coughing] Can you walk? I remember walking. And this. [subway horn blaring] We have to get out of these tunnels before they find us. Us? Us? This is where I get off, sport. Why should I go anywhere with you? You're right. I wouldn't, either. They bought me, all right, just as you said, but not with money. Then what was His Evolvedness talking about when he mentioned your reward? I'm one of the few resistance fighters old enough to remember what the world was like before the Bestials took over. I was 13 when my family came to Brooklyn and opened a green grocery. My brother Durwood and I soon learned how to get the best of the streets. But our happiness didn't last long. The neighborhood was slowly overrun by hostile Bestials -who taunted us for being human. -[Woman screams] Soon, the High Evolutionary's troops overtook the city, ripping entire families from their homes, separating them. The war raged, the humans lost, and those of us who managed to survive returned to find our streets gutted and our homes destroyed. I never saw my family again. Sad story, chum, but not everybody with a sad story goes around betraying his friends. Very true. But today, after I was arrested, Sir Ram gave me this. My brother Durwood's alive, Spider-Man. He's spent the last 30 years slaving in the bowels of Wundagore Castle. Sir Ram promised that if I helped trap you-- He'd release your brother. And you believed him? Durwood's all that's left of my family. There was nothing I wouldn't do to free him. But I couldn't go through with it. And now... Now it's time for us to get big brother out of there ourselves. Don't toy with me, Spider-Man. You may not believe this, Bromley, but I know what it feels like to be desperate for somebody you love. [Bromley] This won't be easy. It could well be the most highly guarded place in the world. -Even the toughest security can slip up somewhere. -[whirring] What do you say we try the service entrance? What happened to Louis? Uh, his kid's getting married tonight. [muffled grunting] [thinking] Uh-oh. Rodent alert. [sniffs] Spider-Man? It is you. Seize him! Uh, wait. I, uh-- I came to see you. Me? What are you doing here? Return to your posts. The truth is, Lady Vermin, I can't seem to get you out of my mind. So you thought you'd sneak in here and surprise me, is that it? Beautiful and smart. And to think, I didn't know you cared. [thinking] Spidey, don't you dare be sick. [Man] Hurry up! We got another million gallons of water to get purified tonight! Come on, you scum-suckers! Suck more scum! Better make this snappy. Queen Ratifah's only giving me 15 minutes while she "makes herself more comfortable." What is this place? A purification plant. Sir Ram says it provides clean drinking water to the castle and half the city. Remind me to order bottled. I don't see Durwood. There he is. Get to work, slime-sucker. Durwood? It's me, Daniel! Danny? [laughing] I knew you'd come. You knew? You had that kind of faith? In the High Evolutionary. He's the one who told me. What? He said your spider friend would come for me. [laughing] and when you did, I'd get a promotion As soon as you and Spider-Man are locked up, I'll run this place. Durwood, I'm your brother! [beeps] [High Evolutionary] Nice of you to be so predictable, Spider-Man. [Spider-Man] You! This was another trap. Surely you didn't think entrance to the castle was possible without my assistance? But you have consistently underestimated me, haven't you? Perhaps you need a demonstration of how highly I've evolved. [grunts] What was that? I just got clobbered by nothing. You've been a thorn in my side far too long, Spider-Man. Helping the rebels destroy a power plant, hindering my efforts to control the symbiotes. [yells] [grunts] Telekinesis. Whoa! How do I fight a guy who can smack me around with his mind? Hold it, Danny boy. You're my ticket to the top. [blow lands] [groaning] [grunts] Educating you is indeed a pleasure, Spider-Man. A pleasure that will increase tenfold by the time we are finished tonight. A few more of these mind punches, and I'm down for the count. And now, arachnid, the final demonstration. Hate to lose and run, but I can't see any other way. [yelling] [grunts] [thinking] This is it, Spidey. You gotta come up with something. That sound. These ray thingies must be sonically powered. Maybe I can counteract them. -Sonics on. -[mechanical humming] Gotta raise the pitch. Will the repairs hold? Sonics up. [mechanical humming intensifies] -[yells] -[clattering] [grunts] [grunting] I beat you when we were kids! We aren't kids! Aah! [yells] [screams] [grunting] Durwood! [huffs] Me own brother using me! I could say it runs in the family, but I'm not the kind of guy who'd bring up that kind of thing. Huh. I earned that one. I have to get back to the rebels. They'll be worried, and they're all the family I have. I know what you mean, bub. I know what you mean. [Shane] Mom! Mom! Look! -[door opens, closes] -[Peter] Hey, what's all the racket about? [Naoko] Peter, you're back. After you disappeared at the carnival, I was starting to think-- That's what I'm trying to show you, Mom. Look. I told you he wasn't a coward. And you were right, Shane. I am so glad. How do you do it, Peter? How do you always get such great pictures? I wish I could tell you, Shane. But if I did, you'd steal my job. [theme music playing]
