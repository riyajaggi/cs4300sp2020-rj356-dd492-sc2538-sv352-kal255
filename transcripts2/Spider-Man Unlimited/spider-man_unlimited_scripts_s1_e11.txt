 [siren wailing] [Spider-Man thinking] Basement jazz. Just the way I like it, not too highly evolved. [chuckles] Makes me really miss those arguments about rock and roll I used to have with Aunt May. I hope she's all right and not too worried about me. Yeah, that'll be the day that Aunt May doesn't worry about poor Peter. Venom. Without Carnage? Dumb without Dumber? I thought those two were tied together at the symbiote. Increase the harmonic game. That should draw him more quickly.

 [Spider-Man thinking in singsong voice] Oh, Venny, come out, come out wherever you-- [grunts] We just love running into old friends. [thinking] Oh, man. Forgot Venom doesn't trigger my spider sense. [grunts] Gotta hit the old sonics. [beeping] So much for my secret weapon. [Venom] You should enjoy this. We know you always thought of yourself as a real swinger. [Spider-Man thinking] Be close, Spidey. It could be worse. You're okay if he doesn't let go! [grunting, yelling] [grunts] [theme music playing] [grunting]

 [Spider-Man thinking] Can't do it. I-- I can't... [grunts] Gotta do it. Come on, Spidey. Find the strength. How else are you gonna get back to MJ? [grunting] He's in position. Now. [screaming] [grunts] -[yelling] -[thinking] My little human wrecking ball act trashed some of my suit's circuitry and fried my sonics. [Venom groaning] [thinking] Venom. It sounds like he's in pain. Beasties in the basement always spells one thing-- bad. [groaning continues] [Spider-Man thinking] Brock? But how? Eddie Brock and his symbiotic soulmate Venom are splitsville? No way. The first time I saw a symbiote was back on Earth when John Jameson's shuttle crashed on the Brooklyn Bridge. Before I even knew what it was, the symbiote bonded with me. It flowed over me, forming a kind of alien costume which gave me powers I'd never dreamed of. But then it started taking over my mind, slowly turning me into a monster. When I finally found its weakness, I managed to free myself from the symbiote's control. But it found an all-too-willing host in Eddie Brock. Brock became Venom. But because the symbiote had bonded with me first, it knew my every move and my secret identity. [grunting] It was the toughest fight of my life, but I finally beat him. The authorities took him to a happy place to make baskets all day, until he met his soon-to-be partner in slime, Carnage. [gasps] [screaming] [yells] [Spider-Man] Over the years, Brock's been completely subsumed by the symbiote. No telling what's happened to his mind in all this time. He may not even remember who I am. Parker, you did this to me! Brock, cool it. I'm trying to help you, you big jerk. And I felt sorry for you? Venom's very existence threatens me and this entire planet. [grunts] You're on your own, Eddie. But you're not Venom, are you? You're a human being-- one who needs help. I know just where to get it. [Carnage] Grow, young ones. We're building you a cozy new home. We've redecorated the entire place. The tendrils, humidity, organic fertilizer. Soon you'll be big and strong. No! No! You can't contain us! What have you done with our brother Venom? -[shuddering breaths] -[beeps] Ugh! This is quite an outfit. Is this guy a friend of yours? I guess you could say more of an acquaintance. [beeping] Whoa. Never seen readings like this before. He's been detached from a symbiote, but this is an extreme case. Peter, how do you know somebody in a condition like this? I worked with him at the-- Well, it's a long story. One that's about to have a short ending. This man was bonded to a symbiote for so long that if he's not reunited, he'll die. -[Shane] Mom? -I have to see Shane. But I need to know more when I get back. Parker, do something. Help me! The doctor says you need the symbiote back to live. Then go. Get it! Don't forget. I can tell the whole world about you, web-head. Oh, you really know how to appeal to a guy, don't you, Eddie? I need my symbiote, Parker. I need it! Let's get this straight, Brock. I like you even less than you like me. As far as I'm concerned, you should be locked in a trunk in a cell at the bottom of the ocean. But I can't sit back and watch a man die. Not even you, Eddie. I'll do what I can. I'm gonna hate myself in the morning. Hurry. [gasps] Give us what we want, flesh-bags! [whimpering] Venom was here. We know it! [yells] Where is Venom? Tell us! Hey, believe me, if I knew who you was looking for, I'd tell ya. [Spider-Man] Hey, Carny, how about a time-out? You, Spider-Man, always hated us. What have you done with Venom? Maybe he's out getting that new hairdo he's always wanted. [grunts] You take the low road, Carny. I'm moving up in the world. [laughing] [grunts] [grunts] Don't panic, folks. I'm with the transit police. Like the new uniforms? [screams] Where is Venom? Where did you take our other self? Wherever he is, I'll bet the conversation is better. How about we talk about, say, literature? I want Venom! [people screaming] -[gasps] -[both gasping] -[both grunt] -Carnage, no! This isn't their fight! You're right, lead-brain. It's ours. So tell us where our other half is, and they won't be punished. [thinking] Let's see. I'm trying to save one of my biggest enemies, another enemy is about to do a major overhaul on my anatomy, innocent people are counting on me, and my sonics are kaput. Oh, I'd definitely say things can't get any worse. -[horn blaring] -Me and my big mouth. [horn blaring] Carnage, you're right. I know where Venom is. Then tell us, or we will take great pleasure in digging for the truth. -[Spider-Man] Let them go first. -[grunting] Tell us, spider scum. [Spider-Man] Let's put it this way. He's not over there. Buh-bye, Carny. Don't forget to write. Halt! Turnstile violation. Proper fare required. [Spider-Man] Now the tin cans show up. That's it, guys. Patrol those streets. Last time Brock had his symbiote, it was here in the alley. [screaming] [Spider-Man thinking] A piece of Brock's symbiote. That thing nearly cost me my sanity the first time. No way I'm getting near it. It's so weak, like Brock. That thing remembers me. It's trying to tell me something. Okay, little guy. Man, I just know I'm gonna regret this. Venom was lured into the alley? [screaming] [grunting] [screaming] [Bestial] The thetasonic beam separated the subject, Dr. Brofski. We're bringing in the symbiote now. [Spider-Man thinking] Brofski? Naoko told me she studied under a Dr. Brofski at ESU. Couldn't survive any longer. I've gotta hurry. Not so fast. Your system's not ready for it. My system will never be ready for it. -And I thought my luck was bad before. -[door opens] [Shane] Whoa! You're really big! Are you a pro wrestler? I thought we put you back in bed, young man. Aw, Mom, I can't sleep. I keep dreaming about Dad and wondering where he is. Something happened to your husband? [Naoko] Ex-husband. And something's always happening to him. Want to play my new 3D video wrestling game? Uh, I've never done this before. Never done a Tek-Boy? Where'd Peter find this guy, Mom, in a cave? -You're okay. It'll pass. -[Eddie groaning] You know, for a minute there, I was starting to like feeling human again. [Dr. Brofski] My thetasonic technology is proving to be very capable, Excellency. Thetamatic waves are harmless to humans and Beastials, but intolerable to symbiotes. [High Evolutionary] The harm that befalls humans is of no concern to me. But I will do everything in my power to protect you, my creations. I have cooperated with the symbiotes out of need, but I'm counting on you, Doctor, to give me the means to destroy them. [Spider-Man thinking] I should've known Mr. Evolutionary P. Poo-Bah wouldn't share his planet. The scourge of the symbiotes will end, Creator. I promise you. You will be greatly rewarded, Doctor, if you succeed. But if you fail... [Spider-Man thinking] Brock's symbiote. It's in there. Prepare for Phase 2 testing. We need a complete analysis of the symbiote's DNA. [grunts] No. What are you doing? Sorry, Doc, but your patient's checking out. [Dr. Brofski] Don't be a fool. Interfering with an alpha-level project means DNA recycling. [Spider-Man] Well, you can't say I'm not willing to do my bit for the environment. [thinking] Should've known it was going too well. [grunts] Great. Not only am I carting around my worst nightmare, it's leaking. Hey, not on me. [Machine Man] Bus 54, you will land immediately. [Spider-Man thinking] The big guy here is dying, too. Looks like I don't have a choice. I'll be your life support. Oh, this could be an even bigger mistake than telling Anna Watson I didn't want to get fixed up with Mary Jane. Oh, yeah. I'd forgotten how good the symbiotic costume feels. Just stay out of my brain until I can get you back to Brock. [screaming] Yes, we hear you. A path no longer shielded. You go where? [sinister laughter] I'm sorry, Eddie. There's not much more I can do. Sure there is, Mom. There's gotta be. You'll see, Eddie. My mom's the best doctor in the world. -Shane. -It's okay, Doc. I'm sure he's right. You've got the best bedside manner I ever saw. [doorbell rings] Shane, can you go see who that is? It's not so bad. After all this time, at least I'll die a human. -[shudders] -[whack] -Mom! -Shane! Mom! Ah, just what we were looking for. Carnage, no! Get away! Get away? You can't reject us, Eddie. It's like rejecting yourself. [gasping] [Spider-Man thinking] Good thing I lost those Machine Men with my shortcut through the sewers. Not exactly hygienic, but effective. [grunts] Maybe not. Surprise, surprise. The guest of honor's made it to the party. No! I want to stay Eddie Brock, whatever the price. Are these the ones that made you forget the joy of the synoptic? For that, they will pay. No! No! Leave them alone! -[blow lands] -[grunts] [Machine Man] Where is the laboratory sample you stole? Where is the symbiote? Ugh! Where is your deodorant? The whole neighborhood knows where you've been. Say goodbye to your playmates, Eddie. Carnage, no! Okay, physician, heal thyself. Only one way to help them. [grunts] I'm sorry I didn't get to know you better. [roars] Honey, you're home! Leave them alone! [growling] This is a sight to warm a man's heart. Symbiotes. Do not move. You are in my custody. [Spider-Man thinking] Brock? We know that weapon. [laughing] [Spider-Man] It's finished. I did what I said I would. Eddie? [scream] There is no Eddie Brock! Only Venom! We have returned! And we are angry. [laughing] It is the Age of the Synoptic. And you, Spider-Man, are in our way. My favorite parasites together again. Another comeback tour we could all do without. The synoptic will swallow you up. And spit you out as part of us. [Spider-Man thinking] If my sonics worked, I might have a chance. But now... Sorry to disappoint you guys, but I'm not a team player. Oh, great. This thing's trigger's jammed. No way I can get off two beams in time. [thinking] If I set it to overload, maybe I'll get a nice thetasonic boom. [yells] Where'd they go? Whoa. Spider-Man, do you know what you did? Uh, saved you? Saved us? You practically destroyed the clinic. You're no better than those sicko symbiotes. [Spider-Man thinking] I know helping Brock was the right thing, no matter how it turned out. So why do I feel like such a failure? Some things don't change. No matter where I go in the universe, everybody hates Spider-Man. [Dr. Brofski] So you see, Your Excellency, due to Spider-Man's interference, we lost the symbiote before it could be completely analyzed. Spider-Man's interference or your carelessness, Doctor? Sir Ram shall mete out your punishment. I will deal with Spider-Man. And I promise you, no living creature would ever wish such a fate. [theme music playing]
