Then I must've forgotten. I'm just about to eat. I'll call you after. Um... Do you remember me, sir? You made my dinner. Look out!

Sir, sir, you need to sit down, you're bleeding! Please help! Please. Just sit down. Put his mask on. You have to stay put. Okay? We'll be right with you. Hi, ma'am, my name is Officer Reid. I'm gonna take a statement from you, if that's okay. Yeah, sure. So, were you driving your car near the restaurant? Yeah. Did you happen to see the truck coming? Yeah, I guess. And did you see from which direction? I just spoke to your colleague earlier. Uh-huh. Uh, did you happen to see the driver? Could you describe him or her? No, I can't, the truck came out of nowhere. I swerved my car out of the way. Is this some kind of attack, or something? We're working on it. Incoming! Another victim from the truck crash. Alice DeMarco, 52 years old. Decreased LOC. My daughter, she needs me. Was she in the restaurant with you? Alice? Alice? She lost consciousness. She can be V-tach. Let's get her on three. One, two, three! Support out on three! One, two, three! Got it. - Cardio right before intubation. - That's ready. Let's get her on oxygen. I need 50 ketamine IV, push! 200 J, synchronized. Charging. Has somebody performed CPR on this woman? The EMS said they found her with a pulse. Okay, clear! You should know that her heart stopped. - Before the paramedics arrived. - Get him out of here. Let's intubate first. What were you doing in there? I don't know. That woman, her doctor needs to know that her heart stopped. Okay, now she knows. But the patients at this hospital are not your concern, alright? I need you to wait right here, get medical attention and then give a statement to the police about the accident. - Do you understand me? - TT is not looking good. He's fading fast, and check this out. I think he's got a drill hole in his skull. Significant epidural hematoma and cerebral edema. We need to get Dr. Bishop up to the OR now. Bashir. Oh! How are you feeling? What did you do to me? I had to relieve the pressure behind your eye. You're gonna get your vision back. You saved everyone. Ahmed. Did he get out? I told him that he was in there, but... Thank you, Bashir. He was just here. What is it with this guy? You were saying he seemed jumpy. Oh, maybe in shock, he was in a major accident. You have an address on him? Uh, no, we haven't registered him yet. We've been a little bit swamped. Maybe he didn't want to be. Registered. You said he's Middle Eastern. Hey! You! You gotta come with me. Why were you such in a hurry to get outta there? - I wasn't. - No? You were discharged from this hospital? You were told to wait and see a doctor. I know if a doctor told me I needed medical attention, I'd be sure to get it. I'm not seriously injured. Everyone else in that truck's path was. Lucky you're fine. And you were also told to stick around and give a statement to me. I saw that truck one second before it hit. - I didn't think that would help you. - That makes you a witness, and a witness that doesn't cooperate is guilty of obstructing a peace officer. That, uh, restaurant is a crime scene. - What were you doing there? - I work there. I'd like to see some identification, please. - Is that necessary? - Yes. Sit tight, Mr. Hamed. Hey, Mags. Your patient from the truck crash? - Yeah. - Her daughter's here. - That woman with the baby. - Yeah. - She's looking for you. - Okay, thanks. There's an electrical disturbance in your mother's heart, which is causing it to beat irregularly. I just talked to her. Why is this happening to us? It's not uncommon after trauma for the heart to... Is it time for you to eat? He should be sleeping. Oh. Uh... Does she have a history of heart disease or is she on any medications you're aware of? No. I don't know. Okay. Well, we had to intubate to manage her breathing. She's in an induced coma while we isolated the cause... Is my mother gonna die? - She can't die. - We're doing everything we can. You said her heart stopped in that restaurant? How is she even alive? I'm still figuring that out but the best doctor I know was there with her. Those other victims were lucky Bishop was with them. He needs a craniotomy to evacuate what's left of the hematoma and relieve swelling. You think he gave himself a Burr Hole with a power drill? For a blind shot, it's right where it needed to be. I wanna scrub in. You're a trauma surgeon, June. I got Dr. Bishop this far. We don't need you, Dr. Curtis. But with their chief down, your fellow residents in Emerge do. Fine. Aren't you in on Bishop's craniotomy? - They have it covered. - That's too bad. Looking directly into Bishop's brain might be like staring into the face of God. They're saying he saved everyone in that restaurant before saving herself. Like starting a woman's heart, stopped some guy from going blind. Survival rate for an emergency craniotomy? 50 percent in most cases. June... Do you think he's gonna make it? Switchboard. Can I make a call outside the hospital? It's an emergency. Uh, not from this line. It's internal only. And when did your heart start racing? We were having dinner, so we brought dinner here. Want some? I've eaten, thanks. The nurse said it would stop, we think it did. She's gonna be okay, right? - Uh, yeah. - Can we go? If I do tox screen, will I find cocaine in your system? Or any other drugs? This guy's trying to teach us a lesson.
