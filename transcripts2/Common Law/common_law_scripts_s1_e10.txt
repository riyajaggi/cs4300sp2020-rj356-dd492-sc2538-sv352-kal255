 ♪ Is that Garcia? Dead. Lock off all the exits now! Copy that. Locking it down. Son of a bitch! Hey. It's okay. I'm a cop. I come up here to take naps between making pickups. I hear these guys shouting. I wake up.

 English or Spanish? Both. They're going back and forth. It's getting kind of loud. They're getting kind of mean. I drop my keys. I go down to pick them up. They start-- p-pow, p-pow-- shooting. Did you get a good look at the guys who were arguing? Yeah. I got to throw up. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Get this guy to a toilet! Your mother killed Christmas. She killed it dead, Clyde. Every year, it's the same.

 "You're coming to Pittsburgh, right? I don't want to be alone for the holiday." Well, she is alone. In-laws. Even when they're not in the same time zone, they can ruin your day. Yes, in-laws are a universal problem. But one of the benefits of group is that we all get to share our experiences. Does anyone have anything? Change your phone number. Or move, don't tell them where you went. Wes, you disagree? Hmm? That's just his default state. Clyde, Rozelle, look. When I was married to Alex, my mother was a problem. Didn't get better until I confronted her about it. And that's what you got to do here, Clyde. It's got to be you; otherwise, Rozelle is just the harpy who stole her son away from her. That's what I keep telling him. Call her up. Say, "Mom, "I'm the decider now. "You don't pay my bills anymore. "You don't clothe me anymore. "I make my own choices. That's the way it is." She does help us with money. Wes, how did that strategy work for you? Great. There's a beautiful relationship there now. Between my mother and Alex. Neither of 'em really got over me quitting the law. And, uh, my mom and I e-mail occasionally. It's... cordial. Yeah. Sorry, Dr. Ryan. I got a text message from my old boss. Dan Noone? What's he want, a designated driver? It's not funny. We-we got to go. Excuse me. Sorry. You know you're lucky, right? Yeah? You get to watch a legend at work. Yeah, I heard the stories. Now you get to live the Dan Noone experience. He made me the finely-tuned investigative machine that I am. Yeah? Well, in that case, I am lucky. Got a few things I want to say to him. Nooner! Hey, T! How they hangin', jefe? Ah, they're headin' for the knees, and I wish to Christ that was my only complaint. This is my partner, Wes Mitchell. Hey, Wes. How are yours hangin'? They're hang... Just... I can't. Nah. So, what happened? It's a mess. We had an informant inside of Los Ladrones. You know, the Guatemalan outfit that holds down all the corners in Glassell Park? Our guy said he was making a wholesale buy first thing this morning, so we set up surveillance about a block away, and soon as we got audio, well... all hell broke loose, and the rest you can see for yourself. We got four bodies, and one of 'em's my snitch. I guess someone wanted those corners for themselves, huh? Looks like it. We'll get a description of the shooters as soon as my witness stops puking. So, you have a witness? How's he doing? Still going, last I checked. I don't know how he got anything left. How long has he been in there? 15, maybe 20. What's his name? Charlie Perez. Mr. Perez, open up. Well, you had a witness. Had. ♪Common Law 1x10 ♪ In-Laws vs. Outlaws Original Air Date on July 27, 2012 == sync, corrected by elderman == ♪ Out of my way! Thanks for coming in. Here's what we got. We got a dead informant, we still got three bodies on a rooftop down in skid row, and the only guy who knows what happened is in the wind. Okay, what do we know about this guy you lost? The guy I let get away introduced himself as Charlie Perez. That was his limo that got shot up in the gunfight. We checked the registration. It's under a Charles Perez. He owns a car service. Any address on file? No. Tidy up those papers, son, and lose that picture. If I didn't know better, I'd swear a woman works at your desk. How do we not have a home address on this guy? He owns a limo service. He's got to be registered with the DMV. He's got to have a driver's license. There are 68 Charles Perez's registered with the DMV in L.A. We checked 'em all, and none of 'em are our guy. Did you look up any names besides Charles Perez? Fred Bandak? Who the hell called you in? I did. Perez is a missing person. Why not bring in the head of the department? Missing Persons hasn't been the same without you, buddy. I appreciate that, sir. Look, I'm sorry for your loss. I heard about Snowy. Fallen soldiers, son. Fallen soldiers. This is Snowy Two. Our runner introduced himself as Charlie, but that doesn't necessarily mean that his name is Charles. The man that we're looking for is Carlos Perez. Here is his photo. That's him. That's our guy. I just said that. Now, Carlos has his business registered under Charles Perez because he's a two-time felon. Grand larceny and possession of stolen property. All right, so, an ex-con is there for a drug deal that becomes a massacre. He then flees the scene. Anybody thinking what I'm thinking? Yeah. He might not be a witness. We might be looking for a shooter. All right, guys. Uh, yeah. RHD's got it from here. Thank you. T? Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. What's up, Nooner? Listen, this whole thing's getting ugly. I mean, I got a dead informant, I let this Perez guy slip right out from under my nose. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're in Narcotics. It's not a cut-and-dry operation. You got to take risks. You taught me that. Yeah, I did. I did. You see, we got this new major. It's a 35-year-old chick. She keeps telling me the era of the cowboy cop is over. I know this is your case, but, you see, my boss-- she's just itching to find a reason to suspend me. If somebody else makes the collar, well, she's gonna have a reason. You want to put cuffs on the shooter, I got your back. You'd do that? Yeah. I'll be there for you any time, any place, any way. Uh... Stay ready. So you don't have to get ready. Hi. I'm Travis Marks. This crime scene hasn't been adequately photographed. Well, we'll, uh... we'll be sure to send the techs a harshly-worded e-mail. First principles, son. If your techs can't process a crime scene thoroughly, then, the entire investigation is nothing but a leaky boat. Your old boss is a freak show. Snowy Two? He does know it's weird to name your new dog after your old dead one, right? Look, Fred Bandak has a long and distinguished career. He's entitled to a few... quirks. Yeah. Whatever. This is our case. Can we ditch him now and go get some work done? Be patient. Hey, Fred? Don't, don't. Don't. Uh, hey, Fred, is there anything we can do, help save some time? Good investigation takes as long as it takes. You know that. Yes, sir. Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's onto something. He's onto something. Okay, okay. Okay. Now, watch this. What are you doing now, Fred? I'm waiting, son. Waiting for the truth. Okay. Okay, that's an expression. He analyzes everything, doesn't want to jump to any conclusions. He's smart. Let me ask you something. Does he frighten you? No. No. Why would he frighten me? He is the Ghost of Future Wes. If I were you, I'd be terrified of winding up like... that. My guy doesn't lose witnesses. Or suspects, or whatever you call Charlie Perez. No, no. He just carries a dog around like a man-purse. Hey, Fred? No, no, no, don't. No, I'll be sweet. I'll be sweet. Listen, man, uh, quick question. Um, while you're waiting, do you mind if we just go ahead and, um, investigate? If you can't refrain from talking, I'd actually prefer it. Okay, sorry, Fred. Got it. Got Fred mad at us. Don't have to get all snooty at me. I mean, I'm just asking a question. Got the address on Perez. Keep it locked and loaded, team. Thanks, Noone. Wait. Should we wait for the truth or knock on the door? I don't know. What would Dan Noone do? Oh, wait, I do know. Let's have a drink and talk about it while the suspect escapes. LAPD! Open up! Ready? Yeah. LAPD! Behind the table, come up. Hands up right now. Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Okay, okay, relax. No one's gonna shoot, all right? Are you really police? Yes, ma'am. My husband said men might be coming here to hurt us. We were just about to leave. Is your husband Carlos Perez? Is he in the house? Where is he?! I don't know! He came here an hour ago. He said he was in big, big trouble. He gave us this, then he said we had to run. Charlie got away with some money from the crime scene. I warned him not to get involved with those people. What people? Ma'am, if your husband's in danger, we're your best shot at keeping him safe. Charlie wanted to start his limousine company, but he couldn't get a loan or a license, 'cause he's an ex-con. Changed his name to get around the licensing thing, then he went to them for the loan. Saavedra people. The cartel? Everyone around here knows, if you want to borrow money till payday, you go see Miguel Avila at Safari Car Wash. I knew something like this would happen. Something like what? He said they made him do something. Okay. We'll go to the car wash, meet with this Miguel Avila, see if he can tell us where your husband might be. In the meantime, an officer's gonna come by here, he'll take you and your daughter to a hotel, okay? You hear from Charlie, you call us. Thank you. Okay, so this guy Perez takes cartel money, he starts a business, so now he owes them a marker. Looks like they called it in last night. But if Perez is the one who mowed down the four guys from Los Ladrones, why does he think the cartel's after him? He did what they wanted. I don't know. Those guys don't look like car wash employees to me. Stay on your toes. Hello? Hello? Detective. LAPD. Stay right there. Go! LAPD! Open up right now! Travis, get down! You all right? Yeah. On three, yeah? Yeah. One, two, three. He's going, he's going! ♪ Get in the car! LAPD. Put them down. Drop the guns now! Right now! Drop them now, now! Put the guns down! Cops right here! Hey, this is a misunderstanding! Get on the ground now! Get down! A misunderstand. They're my bodyguards. They thought you were gonna hurt me. Miguel Avila? Yeah. You and your bodyguards are under arrest. I don't know anything about a drug deal. I told you, I'm a legitimate businessman. Oh, a legitimate businessman whose employees carry Mac-10s? Hey, it's a dangerous neighborhood. I only called my bodyguards in after that maniac bursted into my office and attacked me. Wait, are you telling us that Carlos Perez threatened you? Yeah. I lent him money. Something I do for people in the community. Well, your philanthropy is very impressive, Miguel. Look, Charlie always paid on time, no problem. But today, he went crazy. He attacked me. He said that if I hurt his family, he would do the same to my wife and my daughter. Now, why would I hurt his family? Because your business is a front for the Saavedra cartel, Miguel. Because, no matter what happened in that parking garage, you know Carlos Perez left with a stack load of your boss's money. My boss. I'm a legitimate... Legitimate businessman. Yeah, we heard you the last ten times you said it. Now you can tell the booking officer down at the station. Oh, come on. All right, I got a text from Fred. "Dear Wesley, "I do loathe these digital leashes, "but they have their uses. "Please come down to the station when you have a chance. Sincerely yours, Fred Bandak." He knows this is not his case, right? Well, I did... ask him for a consult. Which he gave to you. Now it's time to take Snowy 2 for a walk, and get the hell out of our business. It'll be fine. He's just excited to be out in the field, all right? Whatever. Who signs a text message? So, I analyzed every aspect of this melee-- lines of fire, avenues of escape-- and after four and a half hours, I got it all right here in my head. And this is what I found. Spot of blood on one of the tires of the limousine. Your techs missed it. You found a spot of blood at a massacre. Congratulations. What's he even doing here? He's not on this case. Well, this isn't your case, either, Dan. You're still here. It says the spot of blood doesn't match any of the dead bodies. Doesn't match Charlie Perez, either. Which means there was someone else at that scene. Exactly. Someone else who got away. Took the DNA and did a search of the VICAP database. We found a partial match with a degraded sample at a crime scene of the Cabo San Lucas massacre in Mexico. 13 top lieutenants of the Escamilla cartel dead on a beach at a resort. Now, Escamilla's people say that they think that this is the work of a Saavedra assassin they call "El Ingeniero." El Ingeniero. Yeah, I've heard that before. Of course you heard about it-- 'cause I told you about 'em. I'm in Narcotics. I know about 'em. El Ingeniero is "The Engineer." He's a fairy tale. Story that cartel goons talk about and sit around and tell each other when they're bored. Yeah? Well, I believe he's real, that he's in L.A., that he's the gunman that we're looking for. Carlos Perez is the gunman, who's a real person we can place at the scene. Come on, T, tell him you're not going on some snipe hunt. Tell him you're not gonna ignore an essential piece of forensic data. Guys, guys, let's just relax, all right? Doesn't have to be one or the other. Uh... Charles Perez's cousin drives the other limo for the service, right? So if Charlie is looking to skip town, he's probably gonna get in touch with him. We could squat on the cousin, maybe get a wiretap on his phones. Yeah. And while we check up on Fred's lead, we'll wait and see if Carlos gets in touch with his cousin, okay? Hey, guys, there is no boogie man. You know, it'd really be nice to work this case without your greedy, needy ex-boss in my ear. I can absolutely relate to how you feel. Evening, sir. Ah. You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm just, uh, giving Snowy a little exercise. Okay, uh... well, have a good night. Uh, Wes? I just wanted to thank you for letting me saddle up with you again. This is gonna be one of my last times at the rodeo. What do you mean? You haven't heard? Missing Persons is being consolidated out of existence. All duties to be absorbed by the other departments. I'm being forced to retire, buddy. What? Yeah. Well, why don't you just transfer? No one wants me. Look, you spend your career upholding the standards of conduct, you're not gonna wind up with many friends. I'm sorry, sir. That's all right. It's life. I'm not gonna whine about it. Of course, if I were to catch El Ingeniero, that'd bring a lot of headlines our way, wouldn't it? Yeah. Yeah. A-And it'd keep the lights on for a few more years. Yeah. Yeah. Well, let me see what I can do. Hey, it's your theory, Fred. You should get the collar. All right. Sir. Snowy. Come on! So, you promised the arrest to your old boss. Correct. And you promised the arrest to your old boss. He needs it. I owe him. Yeah, I did. Look, Dan Noone may need the arrest, but he doesn't deserve it-- we'd have our perp in custody right now if he hadn't blown it. Like your guy's any better? Yes. He arrives uninvited, he craps on everyone's work, he hijacks the investigation to go hunt for a ghost-- with his mind. Well, at least his mind isn't pickled, like Dan's. If Fred did more doing and less thinking... What? He'd live in the past, have a record like Dan's? Come on, man, you got to look back at his career-- he's done more good than harm. It's-it's not even close. Oh. Oh, oh, so we have to weigh his whole career now. Guys, it's interesting-- what you're dealing with Please. All due respect, this is nothing like an argument over whose in-law's house we're going to for Christmas. Yeah. Yeah, we're talking about dead bodies, drugs, stolen money. All right, put the particulars aside, you're talking about two parental surrogates, important figures in your professional lives, both of whom are demanding your time and attention, and only one of whom can be satisfied. Okay. That's a good analogy. But, you know, what-what do we do? What, you're asking me for a ruling? Yeah. Why not? You do a lot of clever metaphor-making in here, Doctor, and not much solution-providing. Then I say... trust your instincts. No. No. See, that's not an answer, because my instincts are telling me to help Dan, and his instincts are telling him to help Fred. Well, if that's what you both think, then you have your answer. I knew you were gonna say that. Hey, T! T! Nooner! Hey! Got some good news, buddy. We got the tap on Perez's cousin's cell phone. Charlie called him two hours ago, told him to dump his limo down in Marina Del Rey so Charlie could drive it out of town. We're headed over there now. Ready to go to work? What...? Morning, Wesley. You ready to go to work? Later. Good luck. So... how, uh, how are we gonna catch a ghost? Start from the beginning. Review the Cabo San Lucas massacre. And then we...? Wait for the truth. ♪ So you've still got Trudy, huh? Oh, yeah. She's a little worn out, but she gets me from A to B in style. That headlight flap just... stays up like that, huh? Uh-huh. They don't make that part anymore. You ever think about trading her in? You know? You got kids now; maybe get something with a... back seat? Damn, T, you sound like my ex! Sorry. Trudy's not going anywhere. She's O.G., brother, O.G. Besides, I'm not... a minivan type cat. Okay. Uh, uh, here we go. Here we go. We're in business. ♪ LAPD! You're under arrest. For what? I didn't do anything! You ran from a crime scene, Charlie Perez! You're coming in with us-- we got a few questions. About what?! Four dead bodies! And god-doggit! You put a dent in Trudy. What do you mean I can't sit in on the interview? We're the ones who brought him in while these guys were running around chasing the Great Pumpkin! Dan, this is our case now. We brought him in! It doesn't matter! This isn't Narcotics! This is a potential shooter. He stole money from a crime scene! I'm not talking to you! Fine! Travis, tell your old boss I'm your partner now; this is my case-- I'm not gonna sit on the sidelines for it. T, tell him what's up. Guys, guys, guys. Dan, Wes is my partner; it's his case, too. I can't cut him out of it, all right? Okay, look, I wasn't just a witness, I admit that. But I didn't shoot anybody. What were you doing fleeing the scene? I got two strikes; one more, I'm done. I run a honest business to support my wife and kid. This was just a favor; I had to do it. Do tell. When I borrowed that money from Miguel Avila, it came with an understanding, not only that I had to pay him back, but I also owed him a favor. He didn't say what it was, didn't say what it was that I would have to do, just that I owed him. Two nights ago, he cashed in that marker. I get a call from somebody, drops Miguel's name, tells me that I got to pick up somebody at the, uh, Wilshire Sands Hotel out in Santa Monica and take him wherever he wants to go. This guy gets in my car-- white guy, about six feet tall, blond hair... two different-color eyes. He's talking about El Ingeniero. This guy, he barely said anything. Just gave me the address to the parking garage, and that's it. You know, he pulled up the divider. He gets out of the car, starts shooting everybody. Get a detailed description. We need to make a sketch. Fred! We got this, okay? So, tell us more about this man. Hey, Wes, why don't you ask him how his wife ended up with a bag full of drug money if he's innocent! Ask him that! We got it, Dan. So, what do you want me to talk about? The man. The man. Okay. Look, it's all part of the same thing. I stuffed a few bundles of cash down my pants leg 'cause I knew I was gonna have to run. Sorry, guys. The public defender just got here, and he wants a couple of minutes alone with his client. Dan, this case is not about cleaning up your mess. This case is about the truth! The truth is, you just want to make this collar so you can keep that stupid dog of yours in fancy treats for the next couple of years. You leave Snowy out of this. Oh, I thought it was Snowy 2. Do we sound like that when we fight? Man, if we do, we need a lot more therapy. Drink it all in, boys. Could always learn from the guys who brought us here, even when they're not teaching us by example. This anger is a dark whirlpool. Make note. Perez says he's ready to talk to you guys again. His lawyer just got in there. Do we have to tell them we're headed back in? I'm of the opinion that if we leave these two out of it, our lives will get a lot easier. Agreed. Hey, Charlie. Where's your lawyer? I don't need him anymore. Um, I sent him home. Why? Sit down. I want to talk. I don't need a lawyer for that. Okay. There was no pickup. I pulled the trigger on those guys. It was all me. I'll tell you everything. Charlie... what happened? Why are your hands shaking? You guys didn't believe me. It's time to stop selling that line. There was no one else in that parking garage except me. I did it. That's what you want to hear, right? That's a very bizarre and sudden confession, Charlie. Somebody got to you. What'd your lawyer say to you? Why do you seem so scared right now? I'm not scared. ♪ Well, I just got off the phone with City Services. Charlie's lawyer signed in with city credentials under the name James Wilder. They don't have any record of a public defender by that name. Look at this. What? This guy managed to keep his face hidden from almost every single camera-- now, that's no accident. Hm. Wait, stop. Right there. Gotcha. Ah, you're sly, but so am I. Yeah. Remember Charlie's description of the man he brought to the parking garage? Blond hair, six feet tall, and I'll bet you if we had better resolution, we'd see two different-color eyes. That's him. That's him. That is the man who came here and flipped Charlie Perez. Yep. Now we've got to figure out what he said to him. Charlie's not talking. Yeah, not anymore. Before he changed his story, he said he picked up the gunman at the Wilshire Sands. Now, if that's El Ingeniero, he's staying at that hot. Sure, I remember him-- that's Mr. Coffey. He checked out a few days ago. I don't suppose he, uh, told you his first name? Um... I think it was Donald. I hailed a cab for him a few times, but he didn't talk much. I remember he had some wild eyes. One brown, one blue. How you doing, Charlie? Well... We know who your lawyer is, Charlie. We know that he's the man that you picked up from the Wilshire Sands Hotel. He's El Ingeniero, isn't he? I don't know what you're talking about. Whatever he told you to get you to confess, whatever deal you think you struck... Hey... He's lying, man. All right, Travis, take it easy on him. Can't you see he's having a tough day, okay? He'll come around. We can help you right now. You know what, you're a loose end. And I promise you, as soon as you get to county... they'll take care of you. We're trying to help you. It's not about me. Who's it about? You know who these people are. You know what they do. You really want to throw in with them? This guy, El Ingeniero... he showed me a picture. It's my wife and my kid. He's got 'em. Hi, you've reached Martha Perez. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Okay. You hear anything? No. Uniform has been swinging by the hotel to check on him, says the room's empty and they have not checked out yet. There you are. Where the hell you guys been? T, I've been calling your cell phone... Dan, Dan, not now. El Ingeniero's got Charlie Perez's wife and kid. What? Yes. All right, look... No. Here's what we do... No, no, no, no. Okay, w-w-wait. I... I am the decider now. You don't have to boss of me anymore; you don't... get to solve this case, and that's just the way it is... man. What the hell's that all about? I think Travis just had a breakthrough. We can analyze that later, okay? El Ingeniero is alive and well. El Ingeniero may be alive and well, but we don't know where he is, Fred. we don't even know his real name. The Saavedra cartel knows how to get in touch with El Ingeniero. Miguel-- from the car wash-- he's got a line to him. You think he's gonna tell us where to look? He will if he's properly motivated. Dan... No, T, T, T, I'm cool. I'm cool. I just want to help. I really do. Look, you two guys, you know how to get to the truth by sitting on it and waiting and waiting, and you did. You did the right thing. You got the answers you were looking for. You were right. I admit it. What I want to know is... Well, are you willing to get your hands dirty? You haven't even told me why I'm here. Here you go, gentlemen. Signed, sealed, and delivered. I'm gonna sue you guys for this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What happened to your hand, Miguel? That stupid dog bit me. Now will somebody tell me why the hell I'm here? - I'm out on bail. - Yeah, we know. Your lawyer sprung you. But here's the thing, uh, my partner and I were just talking about this whole World War III thing that happened over at your car wash the other day. I don't know if you know this or not, but stressful situations like... a bunch of men firing at you with automatic weapons, that just clouds up your memory. Yeah. Yeah, we talked about it. And we realized we had it all wrong. But now we're clear. See, you were holding one of those guns. What? No, that's a straight lie. No, that's attempted murder, two counts. And you can hire a lawyer, you can complain all you want, but who do you think a jury is gonna believe? You, a loan shark fronting a business for a drug cartel, or two decorated detectives? You can't do that. I didn't shoot anybody. We're gonna do it. Yeah, we did it. Oh, yeah, you're going to jail. Long time. Done. There it is. See you in court. Bye-bye. No, w-w-wait. Wait. Hang on. Hang on. All right, Miguel... we're feeling generous today. So you tell us what we want to know, we'll reconsider. Where is El Ingeniero? And where is Charlie Perez's family? You tell us that, we'll forget about what happened at your car wash. He's leaving the country tomorrow morning. And I've never known the man to travel unless he's done with a job. Shh. Go. LAPD! Drop your weapons; get your hands in the air! But do not shoot, he has hostages! Go, go, go. Dan. Dan! Got him? Yeah. You're okay. Well, the EMT's saying you're gonna be fine. Just have to learn to shoot with your left hand. No, my shooting days are over. Why? What are you saying? Eh, maybe my lieutenant was right. The era of the cowboy cop is over. Might be time for me to settle into a desk job, leave all this to the new generation. From what I can see, you guys are doing okay. We're trying, sir. We're trying. It doesn't mean you're gonna get a minivan. Hey. T? I know you promised me the collar, but... I think it should go to Bandak. He needs it more than me, and besides that grumpy son of a bitch was right. Should I tell him you said that? Just the grumpy son of a bitch part. Stay ready. Sir, you don't have to get ready. You said it. Charlie's agreed to testify against the cartel. And in exchange, the government has agreed to put the Perez family into the WITSEC program. Give them a new start in life. Nice collar, boys. Nice collar. Thanks, Cap. This was not ours, though. This one belongs to the Missing Persons Department. Sorry fellas, but I'm gonna have to object. It's not my arrest, it's yours. What are you talking about, sir? You need this. Missing Persons is a thing of the past. No collar's gonna change that. So what are you gonna do now? I have no earthly idea. I guess I'll think of something. Wes, you turned into a fine detective. Travis, you're on your way. Ha, funny guy. Mike. Fred. You done good with these boys. Ah... They were men before they came here because of guys like you. I appreciate that. Dinnertime. See ya in the funny papers. Wow. You are so gonna end up with a little dog like that. You're so gonna wind up with an old, beat-up sports car like Dan's. Trudy? Yeah. Come on, man. Trudy's O.G. O.G.? What does that mean? Old and grimy? She has one working headlight. Boys. What? Get out. He started it. But we waitin'. Get out. For the truth, Cap. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
