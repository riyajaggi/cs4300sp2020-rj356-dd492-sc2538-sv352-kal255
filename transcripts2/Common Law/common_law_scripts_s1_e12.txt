 Good. No, no, great. Wes, you go. Take a deep breath. Let every ounce of rage bubble to the surface, then let it all out with one big, primal scream. No. This is your birth mother. This, this is your old therapist, who strung you along and then kicked you out of her group.

 Don't know if I'd put it that way, but okay. Crumple 'em up. Wad them into a ball. Then rip them into pieces until you have confetti for people to throw on you at your "Travis Is Awesome, And You Don't Need Any Woman To Validate You" parade. No. Today, we're gonna go through my ex-wife's files. We're gonna be looking for accounting irregularities. Excuse me? What is the therapeutic value of this, exactly? We're just helping you with your divorce. The value is confronting your feelings when you come upon a written record of mendacity and deceit.

 A forensic accountant is just a fancy name for somebody who can read a spreadsheet. $200 an hour, my ass. In this room, we say no to the divorce industrial complex. In this room, we go through the files ourselves. No. Absolutely not. Could I talk to you two guys for a second? Rest of you dive in. You know, I thought it might be fun to have a couple cool cops around. But we have to face facts: you two suck at therapy. We suck? Yeah. You keep resisting my methods, and I'll tell you something else: you really bring the energy in the room down. I-I don't want you here anymore. We can't get kicked out of another group. I'm not throwing you out. You've just seen some things; there's a couple new techniques I don't want getting around. So, I'm offering you the deal of a lifetime. You don't have to show up anymore. Couple months, I'll call up your captain, tell him your all better. End of therapy. Come on, guys. It's a win-win. So, how much you think these guys get for robbing a food truck? Well, I think they robbed three in the last two months. They must be making some kind of money at it. So, this is good. Hmm? Huh? We don't have to show up for therapy anymore. Oh, heck, yeah. Of course, it's good. I mean, you and me? We're doing better, baby. We're doing so much better. Yeah. Doing way better. I feel great. I feel... healed. Feel much better. It's just, you know, Pack-Man's birthday is a few days away. You think I don't know that? I've been thinking about it, man. I-I just... I wouldn't mind talking to Dr. Ryan about it. Well, we don't have that option, Travis. Pack-Man's birthday-- it's gonna come, and it's gonna go, and neither one of us-- we're not gonna do anything about it. That's got to be them. Let's go. L.A.P.D! On the ground! What the hell? You're under arrest! Stay down! Hey! What the hell are you guys doing here? Hey! Check it out. R.H.D. in the house. Sorry, boys, this is an S.I.S. bust. We've been tracking these two all week. Give us a heads-up next time, okay? We work undercover. You know that. Mitchell. Marks. How you doing? We're good. We're just, uh, moving out. How's therapy? You okay? Hugging it out? Crying on each other's shoulders? We're fine. We're just leaving. I only ask 'cause Pack-Man's birthday's coming up. Do not let him get under your skin. He ain't worth it. Me and the fellas-- we're gonna have a few beers in his honor. You should stop by. Do not... Travis, no! Travis, no, he's not... Come and get it. Come here. Come here! Relax and cut it out! Oh, yeah, yeah, you're doing fine. Doing great. Guys, thanks so much for your help with the chairs. These yoga people have been insisting. Night, Dr. Ryan. Good night. I'll see you all in a few days. Okay. Take care. We need your help. We're not as better off without you as we thought we'd be, but other than that, we're-we're good. Look, uh, you're the only doctor that's been able to do a damn thing for us, and, uh... and we need you. We need... this. We're sorry that we broke your trust. It wasn't just that. I mean, you've been reluctant to be here since day one, dragging your heels. We'll do... better. And what reason have you given me to believe that? None. We want to change that, and, uh, we've got an offer for you. If... you'll take us back, we'll answer the question we've been dodging the entire time we've been here. We'll tell you why we were sent to you in the first place. We'll tell you why I pulled my gun on Travis. ♪Common Law 1x12 ♪ Gun! Original Air Date on August 10, 2012 == sync, corrected by elderman == ♪ ♪ Travis. Do not move another inch, or I swear to God, I'll shoot. All right, stop right there. What? Stop interrupting me when I'm trying to tell the story. You're not telling it right, okay? First of all, I was not wearing an ascot. Are you sure? Travis, I don't own an ascot. Why would you even put that in the story? All right, you're just such a tightass, I guess I picture you as an ascot guy. Just tell it. Fine, no ascot. All right? Travis. Don't move another inch, or I swear to God, I'll shoot. No. What? No, no, no, no. I said no ascot. No. Trav, you're still not telling the story right. Are you denying you pulled your gun on me? No, but if Dr. Ryan's gonna understand why I pulled the gun on you, we have to tell her the whole story. We have to start from the beginning. We have to tell her about Pack-Man. Yeah. Who's Pack-Man? Why are you even bothering to enter the sharpshooting competition? Why, the man asks. Ain't no shame in second place, baby. Well, remind yourself that when you're standing next to me on the podium. Damn it! Something is clearly wrong with this weapon. What's up with that guy? Hey, you still working the theory that someone's killing those working girls who are disappearing off Skid Row? When I can, man. Why? I was on a task force with a guy from Missing Persons who thinks the exact same thing. That's him right there. Hey, Mitchell! Yeah? Hey, Pack-Man, what's up? You got to relax, bro. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer. Hey, get over here. I want you to meet someone. What's with the suit? This is Travis Marks. He works Narco and Vice. This is Wes Mitchell, from Missing Persons. Yeah. You, uh, you spoke when I was a cadet at the Academy. Well, meet for real. What's the line from that movie? "This is gonna be the beginning of a beautiful friendship." So David Paek introduced you two? No one called him David. His name was Pack-Man. Just Pack-Man. But, yeah. Travis and I teamed up to catch the guy who was killing all those prostitutes. - Oh, I remember that case, yeah. - Kind of a big deal. Wes and I, we got, uh, we got promoted to R.H.D. It was a good year. Yeah. A lot of good police work, a lot of arrests. You remember "Storm Front"? "Storm Front"? "Storm Front." Oh, God. It's getting cloudy in here. Cloudy. So what's "Storm Front"? You idiot cops. You really think two of you will bring down Los Guerreros? Oh, you think it's just the two of us? We're just the tip of the spear. We got cops all over this building. If you're smart, you guys would drop your guns and give up. I don't see nobody else. How about you drop your guns? Now! Any idea when backup's coming? Not soon enough. Got an idea? Now step back! I think I see a storm front coming. Cloudy, cloudy storm front. Got it. Stay down. Stay down. I never would have guessed it. Looks like Cuahtemoc's a mellow high. Yep. If you're going to jail, that's the best way to do it, right, guys? - Don't make me laugh. Don't make me laugh. - Stop laughing. I'm gonna breathe this stuff in. Well, it sounds like you enjoy each other's company. Well, for a while. What happened? We just kind of went at each other. And R.H.D. was different back then. You know, Captain Sutton hadn't done therapy yet. Damn thing never works! Geez! Travis, I can't read this report because you printed it on three-hole paper. Of course you can read it. It's only like five words cut off. The burden is not mine to posit what words might be. It's right there... Yo, boys. You think you can put off the catfight for a few minutes? If you can, I'm buying. Tacos, Wes, free tacos. I can't believe it. What is this?! So, it sounds like your friend was the only thing that helped you get along. At the time, yeah. He pretty much was the only thing we could agree on. So, we decided to help him out. How so? Well, Pack-Man introduced us, and six weeks later, we were working Robbery-Homicide together. And that's one of the best assignments you can get. Now, Pack-man, he was stuck back in property crimes. So we decided to throw some busts his way. Help boost his profile. That's some solid shooting, kid. You David Paek? Pack-Man, yeah. John Crowell. S.I.S. Nice to meet you. I, uh, I wrote you a letter when I was at the Academy. Your name-- it keeps showing up in these arrest reports. It's impressive. I just lost a guy to desk duty. I'm looking for someone. If you're interested, come and talk to me. Gentlemen. Oh, my God. Did he just... Offer you a job in S.I.S.? Yeah. Welcome to the NFL, baby. There ya go. Uh, so, what is the S.I.S? Special Investigations Section. It's the other best assignment you can get. It's a covert tactical surveillance team. They do whatever they want, whenever they want. They don't have to answer to anybody. Wow, sounds like a great job. Your friend must have been delighted. Well, we really didn't see him much. He was running undercover. It was such a good gig, we just assumed he was fine until... six months ago. - R.H.D. Marks. - You gotta help me, man. These guys are bad news, Trav. It's gettin' weird. What are you talking about, Crowell? No, all of them. I think they're lining their pockets, skimming from the busts they make, maybe even pulling jobs of their own. Hey, Pack-Man, it's Wes. You sure about this? I'm pretty sure. I heard them talking about something big. A score that's going to set them up for life. I don't know. What's the score? I heard them say two things: "We bought off Henry." August 22nd. It's right before my birthday. I think they know that I know. Crowell's been looking at me weird, I swear. Okay, just calm down. Where are you right now? Staking out a check-cashing place in the Valley. Guys, I got to go. That's Crowell. Okay, sit tight. We'll be right there. What the hell are you guys doing here? Where's Pack-Man? Whoa, slow down. We've been tracking a whole bunch of robberies. Pack-Man was running surveillance, all right? Where is he? By the time we got here, he had taken two of these guys out. Your boy-- he wasn't wearing a vest. I'm sorry. ♪ Travis... Do not move another inch or I swear to God I'll shoot. Okay, who's exaggerating now? I'm trying to make a point here, okay? Guys, I think you're getting ahead of yourselves. What happened after your friend was killed? I, um, I just couldn't let it go. I mean, nothing about it made sense. Yeah, your friend said he'd overheard them saying they'd turn some guy named Henry? Did you ever find out who he was? There's no way to know for sure. We started looking into S.I.S. And the more we looked, the less we liked these guys. We went to Sutton, and by that time, you got your hooks into him. Are you awake? Of course I'm awake. It's called "shavasana." Corpse pose. Wow, Cap. You really getting into this therapy thing, huh? It was either that or lose Helen. Now why are you two disturbing my peace? Pack-Man was shot six times. But the shot that actually killed him came from behind. He was murdered by the guys who held up that check-cashing place. How'd that happen? Well, the driver could have shot him. Not possible. Getaway driver was seen parked right out front of that store. And there's no way he could have flanked Pack-Man. What are you trying to say? Listen, Captain, we've been looking into these S.I.S guys, and it's not good. Financials don't add up. Each one of them lives in a place no cop can afford. Well, you live in a house that no cop can afford. I don't have a bank account in Curacao. John Crowell does. You make accusations against four highly decorated cops, you better be able to bounce a quarter off the evidence. Now, what you guys have got is circumstantial. You guys got to be careful. These guys are dangerous. That's why we got to stay on this. I wasn't finished. I said they're dangerous. You get me something that I can work with. I'll go after them with everything we got. It's the hospital. I told them to get in touch with me if the cashier ever came out of his coma. Can you work with a witness, Captain? He hasn't opened his eyes yet, but he is responding to stimuli. He's been mumbling about getting shot. What the hell is S.I.S. doing here? Hey... What are you doing? Hey, hey, get away from him. I'm bringing him flowers. Carrano's our witness. Relax. Well, I think we can take it from here. You guys paranoid about something? You clear on who the bad guys are? Yeah, we're clear. Good. Oh, my God... They must have known you were on to them. Uh... yeah. How long have you been sitting there? Sorry... It's just technically we're supposed to have the room right now and it's just such a good story. I really appreciate your understanding, but these are my patients; they need their space. Can you at least tell us how it ends? Sorry. You just said we're your patients. You are my patients at this exact moment. We will see where we are when this is done. Okay. Well, Carrano eventually did wake up. He said he saw someone sneak up behind Pack-Man and shoot him in the back. Couldn't give an exact description, but it was damn close to John Crowell. And that was enough to start a formal inquiry. That's great. That's not good? Counselor, I've granted you two separate continuances. Now, can you produce your witness or not? Your Honor, we're trying to locate Damian Carrano. He hasn't been to work in over a week. His apartment is empty. That's unfortunate for your case. If you can find Mr. Carrano, you can refile your charges. Dismissed. Easy, easy. We had people protecting Carrano, and these guys are so good that they must have paid them off, made them run, or buried him somewhere. We couldn't even refile the case. Wow. That must have been painful. Yeah. Yeah. The thing is, John Crowell not only needed to win in court; he needed to gloat about it. You ready to tell this for real? Tough one, kid. I've eaten it plenty of times in court, too. You must be feeling like ass right now. Let me tell you something that might give you some clarity on the situation. Now, I want you to think about that when you're rewinding that one in your brain. What'd the meatheads want? Hey. Hey, Travis. Travis. Travis, talk to me. Travis? Hey, Travis. Hey, hey, no, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, no. Talk to me. Let's sit down and talk about it, all right? What did he say? Travis! You move one more inch, I swear to God I'll shoot. Mitchell! Put it down, kid. You got 30 cops in this room. If you don't stand down, somebody's got to draw. Come on. Lower the gun. What did he say to you? He told me he killed Pack-Man. I was suspended pending an administrative hearing. And when I told the trial board why I pulled my gun on my partner, that I did it to keep him from shooting John Crowell... I wasn't gonna shoot him. Damn it, Travis! Yes, you were. I saw the look on your face! You cocked your gun. There was no consoling you. So what? There was no restraining you! When I told the trial board why I did what I did, they ordered us both to stay away from John Crowell and his men. And they let us back on duty, th two conditions. One, we do this. And two, neither one of us could go anywhere near S.I.S. So it worked out perfectly for John Crowell. It seems that way. It was a smart play. He provoked a hothead into coming after him. And now that we know Crowell and his buddies are planning something big, we're not even allowed to sniff around. That shouldn't stop us. That's not all that's stopping us, Travis! I'm not gonna let you throw your life away and shoot this guy. I just said I wasn't gonna shoot him! How do you know it?! You're not even willing to admit you were gonna shoot him six months ago! I know! You haven't even thanked me for saving you from making the biggest mistake of your life! At great cost to my own career, I might add. Why should I believe you now? Because they killed Pack-Man. Do you understand that? They killed Pack-Man! I know that. You don't have the market cornered on grief, Travis. When did I say that?! Huh? Guys. When did I say that? Guys, guys, guys. You are so close to making real progress here. Don't start sniping at each other. Travis, have you told Wes the truth about what happened that night? No. I don't really know what was gonna happen that night. And I did have my gun. Thank you. I wasn't in a good place. But that was six months ago. I'm different now. We're different now. I promise you, I'm not gonna shoot him. Wes, do you believe that Travis has changed? Can you take his word for it? Yeah. Then, guys, I think you're in agreement. I've only got one thing left to say, and it really isn't very therapeutic. Go kick their ass. ♪ You wanted me to see the Southern California Expo Center? Mm-hmm. Why? They come here. Crowell, Reese, Serra, Prince come here at night, take pictures and walk around the perimeter. I'd say they're casing the place. You've been following them. When I can. You're not supposed to do that. They killed Pack-Man. Why this place? Well... Captain? Captain? Did you sleep here all night? Oh, geez. I set the alarm so I could get up before anybody got here. What are you guys doing here? Well... I already tried diamonds with Helen. It didn't work. No, Cap, uh, it's not about Helen. There's millions of dollars worth of stones moving through that trade show. S.I.S. is planning to rip it off. And you know this how? Pack-Man says that they pulled jobs on their own sometimes, Cap. They been casing the place. You go after these guys, you're gonna roll the dice with your careers. Not to mention mine. That's why we're here. We don't move unless you want us to move. No, what I want you to do is be right. I suggest you get the hell out of here, let me get dressed, huh? We don't know how they're gonna hit the Expo Center, so we have to be ready for anything. We need people on every exit, every entrance. These guys know what they're doing; they will shoot back. There's no guarantee that this ends well. You join this op, you put your career on the line. Does anybody want out? Good. Let's go. Slip in through the side door, gear up where nobody can see you, and then pull the job. They work fast. All units, be advised, we are going in. Hey! LAPD! Put it down! Police! Don't move. Don't move. Hands up. Hands up. Hands up. Up, up, up. Hey! You're not S.I.S. What the hell? Police! Stay there! Damn it! - Hey! Get him up, now! - Hey! Why the hell are you shooting at my men, and why are you in the middle of our bust again? What are you talking about, "your bust?" Yeah! We've been tracking the Huns for a year. And all those people you put in danger... Then you take a shot at my guy. Your guy should have identified himself, all right? Before the operation! You have no right. This is harassment! You're not gonna survive this. You're done. Backing your men is one thing, Captain, but when your men are pursuing a vendetta, somebody's gotta step in and be a grownup! Looks like he's holding his own in there. No, come on. He's getting torn apart in there. - These guys put a year of police work... - I don't get it. Pack-Man said they were planning something big right before his birthday. Anthey were staking out that Expo Center. They were staking it out because they were planning a big bust. You believe Pack-Man was just... Wrong? I don't know. How'd it go? You're each going to get a two-month rap, and after your suspension, you have a choice. You stay together, you go to Pawn Shop Division. Or you split up and you go back to the respective departments that you came from. So... pick between a crap detail or split up? You're lucky you have a choice at all. Figure out what you want to do, but... you got to turn your shields in in the morning, huh? What's gonna happen to you? My career's in the rear-view mirror as it is anyway. I'll be all right. Oh, you're here. Good. Everything okay? It, uh... it didn't go our way. I'm sorry. Uh... I've got a few minutes before the session starts, but we could talk about it... We're not here for therapy. We just wanted to say good-bye. If Wes and I want to stay detectives, we have to split up, so no more couple... you know, no more couples therapy. I see. You've been a good doctor. So thank you. I was a good doctor, and I will continue to be one until you walk out of that door. Talk to me. What happened? Look, it doesn't matter. We were wrong about this one. Ha. In the last two months, I have seen the two of you bet on the outcome of therapy exercises. I have seen you start and finish a spitball competition... Yeah, listen, we suck at therapy... I'm not done. But I have never, in that time, known you to be wrong about your work. Not when it was this important. So think about that before you quit. You need some help cleaning all this up? Nah, I'm good. So, um... I'll see you. What if she was right? Dr. Ryan. What if... what if we aren't wrong? You think I haven't wondered that, Travis? Maybe Crowell and his men were gonna steal some of those jewels after they arrested the Huns, but we're not going to know that for sure now. Their plan changed once they saw us there. Wes, four guys cannot set themselves up for life off of some of the jewels. Okay. I'll play. Crowell and his men couldn't have arrested the Huns and then just had all that evidence disappear from the crime scene. There's... there's too many questions. Those jewels have not disappeared off the face of the earth. They might as well have. To get at them now, S.I.S. would have to get into that evidence locker. It could be done. Once you pay off the right guy. Henry. We always assumed Henry was working somewhere they were planning to hit, right? What if he works here? Yeah, they make a big bust, look like heroes. Then, a little while later, millions of dollars' worth of evidence just.... disappears. Or maybe someone breaks in, holds the place up. Another member of the Huns? Make sure you check "Henry" as a first and a last name. Of course I'm going to check it as a first and last name, Travis. Please, it's our last day together; don't be patronizing. Ooh. Ooh? Look at this. There are eight cops with the last name Henry in the LAPD. But look at this one. "Derek Henry. Evidence Collection." ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Storm Front. Call it. One... two... threesie! ♪ Come on. Let's go! ♪ ♪ Go ahead, boys. Shake hands. ♪ One of the S.I.S. guys has already turned. Ronnie. The quiet one. Yeah. He's already agreed to testify against Crowell. Crowell's going down for killing Pack-Man. And the two of you? How are you doing? Good. Good. Yeah. We both got reinstated, both getting commendations. And, you know, once everyone realized that we were right about S.I.S. being bent, they erased our original suspensions and lifted the terms of our first reinstatement. Uh... which means... We don't have to come here anymore. Couples therapy, no longer required. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What Wes is saying is that it's not compulsory anymore. But if you'll still... take us back... I'm sorry, you're volunteering for another go-round? I can't believe it, either. But the truth is, I'm actually doing a little bit better. And, uh, well, Travis, he's got a long way to go. You really haven't made any progress; you still live in a hotel. - Guys, welcome back. - You're still a compulsive womanizer. Well, define "compulsive." No, we need to use words like "I" in here. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
