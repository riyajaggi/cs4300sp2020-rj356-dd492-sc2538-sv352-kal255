 Jeremy gets Nola to admit that she has feelings for him but later sees her with Simon Elder. She tells him he is blackmailing her. Brian goes to church to pray for Andrea. Chase Alexander approaches Carmelita and tells her he is going to the press with all he knows about Patrick's alleged involvement in the death of Ellen and his secret relationship with Carmelita. Carmelita goes to see Patrick and he invites her to his senate inauguration. The Darlings place a mental health hold on Chase but he escapes and goes to Nick's place where he attacks a visiting Karen. Chase steals a uniform and goes to the inauguration where he fires at Nick and then shoots towards the lectern where Patrick is. All goes dark.

 - Garbage, garbage, garbage. - NICK: Karen? Oh, hey. Speak of the devil. Uh, your mother said you were in here. I didn't realize you were. Please, Nick. You've seen me in less. Remember that? Yeah. Back when you gave a damn. - What are you doing? - Purging. Getting rid of everything Simon Elder ever gave me or liked. I do it after every marriage. Although I don't suppose you could consider this a marriage, seeing that it didn't actually happen. Thank you for that. Look, by working together with your father to stop that wedding.

 I know. You were just looking out for me. Don't worry, Nick. Your medal for heroism is on its way. Look, I just need you to sign these. They'll reinstate your Darling stock now that you're not marrying Simon anymore. Oh, that's right, I get my stock back. Gee, that makes everything better. Leave it there and go away. Okay, maybe I didn't handle the situation exactly perfectly. Yeah. Maybe. But whatever I did, I did for you, because I care about you. That's the truth. Could you please go now? - I'm just saying that's the truth. - Would you please go, Nick? (SIGHS) Nick, I have some troubling news.

 Ellers brother has reared his head again. Not living up to his end of our bargain. Chase is looking for improvements on his deal? No. Brian got a call from the manager at Darling Avionics. Apparently Chase is spreading his theory about how his sister met her death. - He's saying that Patrick killed Ellen? - That, amongst other things. It's alarming, since Patrick's inauguration is less than 48 hours away. Precisely. So I'm gonna need you to go out to Bethpage and have a chat with him. Put a lid on this. Well, I'm pretty much booked, Tripp. You asked me to finish the partnership agreement between you and Simon by the end of the day. - Can't Brian go out there. - Not Brian, no. No, Andrea is in the hospital. He's got a son to take care of. - His plate's full. - Right. And, really, it's best for me if you do it. I mean, you're the only one of us that Chase trusts. - I mean, you know that. - True. - It's best this way. - All right. Let's get out of here. I have to go and meet Patrick and his ever-charming Chief of Staff. NOLA: I strongly disagree. Patrick should be sworn in on the floor of the Senate like everybody else. - This will read as elitist. - Elitist? Really? To be sworn in at Federal Hall is elitist? That's where George Washington was inaugurated, for heavers sake. If you have New York asses to kiss, we'll fly them to D.C. This is not about donors. It's about tradition. Patrick. A little input? A smidge? - Whatever you two think. - Patrick, please. Well, I was just thinking what all this would mean to me if things had gone differently. I am not gonna have another conversation about Carmelita. - I know. But if. If she were just here. - Well, she's not. And she won't be. - It's over. You need to move on. - PATRICK: You don't get it. She's the main reason I ran for the Senate. And the fact that she scurried upstate and stayed there is the reason you won. Grow a pair. (CHUCKLING) I'm afraid I find myself compelled to agree with your Chief of Staff. (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Carmelita is a lovely individual, but she would not be an asset to this situation. Well, I should go. I have some work that I actually have to get done. Thank you for backing me. Well, on those rare occasions when I think you are correct, Ms. Lyons, you will always find me at your side. How very patronizing. (DOOR CLOSES) SIMON: Do you have any idea what it would mean if I could manufacture a clean, non-toxic biofuel - right here on American soil? - You win a big stuffed animal? I am that close. Or I was, until EPA approval died in closed committee. - What do you want me to do about it? - I want you to find out what happened. More precisely, who killed it. I want the minutes from that meeting. You're asking me to steal a sealed file from a U.S. Senator? Sweetheart, you're not working in Patrick's office for the government pension. Get me the damn file. And get it fast. (ANDREA BREATHING TREMULOUSLY) - Hey. - Hey. - (GROGGILY) Where's the little guy? - He's at the zoo with his grandma. I wanna see him. Well, you'll see him when you come home. Brian. - I'm not coming home. - Yeah, you are. These experimental wonder drugs are gonna kick in really soon and then. And you're gonna be home before you know it. No. I won't. - And I need you to say it. - What? Look at me and say it. - Tell me that I'm going to die. - Don't be stupid. You're not. Brian, I need to know that you can say it. That you can be strong for our son. So just say it. Please. (INHALES TREMULOUSLY) You're gonna die. You know that that's true, right? (INHALES) Yes. (SOBS) Thank you, baby. And you know what else you can believe in? I love you. (SOBBING) I love you, too. (GREETS IN ITALIAN) Jeremy, what the hell? Free-trade Americano for the Senator, one non-fat Macchiato for the lady. What are you doing here? This is one of those rhetorical questions, isn't it? I asked you to go to Bloomberg's office and get those permits for the inauguration. - You said, "Get them by lunch." - I said I need them by lunch. - No, you said, "Get them by." - God, what is it with you? You try to undercut me at every turn. And you never miss a chance to treat me like the hired help. You are an office assistant. You are the hired help! This is my brother's office! You're not my boss! - No, it's a simple task! - What the hell is going on in here? I can hear you both down the hall. He is a dimwit. - She's a dungeon mistress. - What? No, I asked you to go out. - You said to get them by. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! We need to tone it down a notch, okay? Both of you. Obviously, you both still have feelings for each other. - Please. - Yeah. And you're gonna need to deal with it. - He is my brother. - Ha! She is my Chief of Staff. Work it out. Otherwise, you'll need to find employment elsewhere. (STERNLY) Both of you. No, no, that's. (SIGHS) Your. (DOOR CLOSES) Nick George. The Darlings' favorite problem-solver. I was wondering how long it'd take for you to show up. How are you, Chase? I stopped by Darling Avionics, and the plant manager told me you walked off the job yesterday. That's right. - Well, you mind if I ask you why? - What do you care? Wife left me. Took the kids. Hey, Chase. Just so you know, it was out of compassion, not guilt, that we were trying to help you. Help me? You offered to buy my self-respect, and I sold it. I took money to look the other way about my own sister's murder. Wait a minute. Ellen was not murdered. Okay. If you say so. Look, I am. I am frustrated for you and I. But I'm at a loss here. - Tell me, what can I do? - Nothing. I've taken everything I'm gonna take from you and the Darlings. (SLAMS TRUNK) Well, what is it you want, Chase? Really? - The one thing you can't give me. - What's that? Justice. - We are full today. Oh, hey, Carmelita. - Hi. - Your 1:00's here. - Oh, thank you. RECEPTIONIST: Okay, 3:00. - Carmelita Rainer? - I'm sorry. Do I know you? Chase Alexander. I'm Ellen Darling's brother. Oh. What can I do for you? I'm going public with what I know about Ellers death. And I thought you might like to join me, seeing as you've been left out in the cold by those sons of bitches, too. I know about you and Patrick. And I can tell by that look on your face you know what I'm talking about. - Actually, I don't. - That's a bunch of crap. Now, you know Patrick killed my sister and you're the reason he did it. You know what, sweetie? Why don't we just take a minute and talk this over, okay? - I'll give you a cut. - I am not here for a haircut. Look, I'll tell you what I know. You tell me what you know, while I cut your hair. Okay? Okay. Okay. This is insane and a complete waste of my time. Why won't you just admit Patrick's right? - About what? - That you still have feelings for me. - No. Not. Negatory. - Come on. Admit it. You can't look me in the eye. You can't even be alone with me. - I can so. - Not without losing your mind. Because whenever you're around me, all you can think about is my hands underneath you, (SOFTLY) my lips on your neck, - that thing I used to do. - (SNORTS) That is such a low blow, bringing up the "thing." I'm a desperate man. Look, you're always complaining that I'm still half-boy. But you're the one who won't work it out here. Not me. God, can't you see I'm crazy about you? You're such a little bitch. (SIGHING DEEPLY) Okay. (WHISPERING) I admit it. Admit what? - I still have feelings for you. - There. Doesrt that feel good? No, because it's never gonna happen. - Why? - It's complicated. Things with you are always complicated. - What is so incredibly different. - Jeremy, just trust me. It's better for everyone that we're through. Hi, I don't have an appointment, but it's very important that I see the Senator. - Hi, can I help you? - I'm here to see the Senator. - I'm. - I know exactly who you are. He's not gonna be back for hours. Listen. If you know what's good for you, you'll stay out of his life. Carmelita. I need to see you. Alone. Of course. Come right in. Oh, dear Brian. What a pleasant surprise. How are you? How is your lovely bride doing? Well, she has about 10 white blood cells and can't eat solid food, but aside from that, she's great. Oh, damn. You should be with her, Son. I'm fine. I can mind the store without you. Well, obviously. I turn my back for one minute and Simon Elder's your new partner? (LAUGHING) What about me? - This is a matter of. - You told me good things were ahead. - And they are. - Yeah? Because the last time I checked, your half of the company and Simors half and Little Saint Nick waiting in the wings leaves bupkus for me. Brian, this is not the time for you to worry about business. Well, I think it is. Because if there's one thing that this whole thing with Andrea has taught me about time, is that there's not enough of it. And this little trip down the corporate ladder is not what I signed up for. I quit. CARMELITA: He seemed very dangerous. I hope I didn't do the wrong thing, coming here. No, it was exactly right. I mean, he kept going on and on, completely irrationally, and then he said he was coming into the city. Carmelita, you were right to come. We'll take care of it. - Are you sure? - Completely. Okay. I should go. Your Chief of Staff wasrt too pleased to see me. I think that she's just worried about, you know, perception. - It's her job. - Okay. I'm gonna go. No, no, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa. She's worried. I'm not. Now that I've seen you, I'm not about to let you just turn around and walk out of here. Let's have lunch tomorrow. Somewhere we can talk. Please, just say you will. NOLA: Chase Alexander is obviously delusional. - I think there's only one option. - TRIPP: Which is? - A 9-27. - A psychiatric hold? We just need a doctor to sign off. TRIPP: I mean, we can arrange for that, yes? Seems like the right thing. Oh, wait a second. Tripp, you sure you want this guy locked up? I mean, all he's done is say he's planning on going public with a story we all know is mostly true. He's been ranting and. This way, he will have professional, medical help. It's for his own good, Nick. Well, what happens for his own good when the 72-hour psychiatric hold is up? Well, if he keeps shooting his mouth off, - we'll have him committed. - No. Well, we better do something, Nick, because the way Carmelita made it sound, we'd be. - Let me talk to him. - You already did. (SIGHS) Well, give me one last chance to give him one last chance. Please. What does this guy mean to you that you're so interested in saving him, Nick? He's a human being. Just let me talk to him. Sure. Absolutely. I mean, just sit down with him, have a chat. But please, make sure that he understands that no good can come from this. Thank you. - Hey. - This is getting to be a habit. Well, I half expected you not to show up. I almost didn't. Don't even think about offering me more money because I know where that's gonna get me. Nowhere. Okay. Listen, Chase, I am the first person to admit that having the Darlings in your life can be destructive. They've made me doubt myself, they've made me wonder about my motives, but the bottom line here is that Patrick didn't kill your sister. He didn't. Wish I could believe that. All right, well, just think about how all this is gonna end. You go through with this, you seek your revenge, you won't win. There is nothing to be won. Nobody knows that better than me. But you can get your wife back, and you can get your kids back. Chase, I am sorry about Ellen, but there is still a way out of this for you. - Yeah? - Yeah. (SIGHING) You know, maybe you're right. I mean, look at me. Look at what I've become. (SIREN WAILS BRIEFLY) (CHA TTER O VER POLICE RADIO) - What the hell's going on? - I don't know. - Did you set me up? - No. No, I did not set you up. I trusted you and you set me up? - Chase Alexander? - What? What's going on? You're gonna have to come with us. We have a court order to hold you for psychiatric detention. Wait a minute, Officer. There has been some kind of mistake. You sick bastard. You lure me here, you tell me everything's gonna be okay, and then you have them show up? - You're worse than the Darlings! - Officer, there's been a mistake! - Yeah, nice. A little more passion. - Uncuff him. I'm serious. Now! It's only for 72 hours, Mr. George. I trusted you. I believed you. You are the worst one of them all. You are the worst son of a bitch of them all! COP: Yeah, yeah. All right. (INDIGNANTLY) What the hell were you thinking? (CHUCKLING) What the hell are you talking about? We agreed that I would go talk to Chase, I would protect him, all of us, from this situation escalating out of control, - and you sent in the cops? - Sent in the cops? Me? If anybody sent in the cops, it would've been Nola. Oh, Nola, my ass. There is nothing that goes on in this family that you don't know about, control, or otherwise quietly endorse. God, Tripp, don't you see that by going behind my back, by using force, you forfeited the one real hold we had on him? - His trust in me! - I did not go behind your back. I would never betray you like that, Nick. No. You would betray me like this. Nick, listen. Whatever's happened, I assure you I had nothing to do with it. Oh, my yearling. How are you? Double grande depresso, Mom. Double grande. - Yes. Employment can be wilting. - It's not the job, it's the boss. Who, Nola? Yeah, she's a definite "wilter." - What happened? - She finally fessed up. - She has feelings for me. - Of course she does. You're adorable. - But she says it's too complicated. - Oh! - What? - (GULPS) She's seeing someone else. - Think? - It does seem likely. - You want my advice? - Mmm. Let her go. Love sucks. Hey, I was in love with Nick for close to, what was it, forever? And what did he do? He booby-trapped the one chance at happiness I had left. You're wrong, dear. Thanks to Nick, you have a chance at happiness. Simon Elder is the culprit here. Nick has always had your best interests at heart. Take my advice. Put your resentments aside and go see him. Soon. As for you, dear, find out who Nola is seeing and do whatever it takes to remove him. You'll get your little wilter back pronto. - Mom! - What? Poor boy's in love. (PIANO LOUNGE MUSIC PLAYING) - Hi. - Hi. I never expected to see this place again. They always ask about you. Jorge made sure we got our private room. Please, come and sit down. - Thanks again for the warning. - Are you kidding? I could never let anything happen to you. What's this? A pass to my inauguration. I want you there. Paddy, you know what they're gonna say, your father, your Chief of Staff. I don't care. I want you there. And after you're in, and that gets you past security, and my father, and my Chief of Staff, I am going to pick you out of the crowd, by name, and announce you to the world. Patrick. Tomorrow's not just going to be the start of my first term of office. It's going to be the start of a new life. For both of us. Brian. - Bishop Bascombe. Your Grace. - Well, isn't this a coincidence? Before I began my hospital rounds today, I was praying, and suddenly the Lord put you in my mind. It was as if you were standing right there in front of me. And now here I am again. Walking away. Well, Brian, the six months is up, isn't it? Your penitential retreat? - Yeah. Time flies. - And? - Have you thought about coming back? - To the Church? Not so much. Brian, it could be, it could very well be, that God is calling you back. He's not. Trust me. How do you know? Because I never called him. But since you seem to have a direct line, - will you give him a message for me? - Anything. The fact that we're all dragged here through time and space, and then made to suffer and die, really sucks. (PHONE RINGING) NOLA: Hello? Yeah, I'm on my way back right now. Just have Jeremy leave the permits on my desk. What do you mean, he went home? Well, can you just call him and. Just forget it. Forget it. I'll deal with it in the morning. NOLA: Yeah. Okay. Bye. JEREMY: (GASPING) Simon. Simon Elder? Are those permits on my desk? - You're seeing Simon Elder? - What? No. Don't lie to me, Nola. I followed you. - I watched you get into his car. - You followed me? My God! - This is harassment! - Are you in love with him? - You are, aren't you? - I don't owe you an explanation. No, you don't. But you're gonna owe my senatorial sibling one, right after I tell him about how you're spending your evenings bouncing on the Corinthian leather with Simon Elder in the back seat of his German love machine. Jeremy, listen. Get away from me, Tramp-o-leena. And what do you even like about that guy? The jewelry? - I can wear jewelry! - I'm not sleeping with Simon. You're not? - No. - Then what is going on? (SIGHS) - Fine. I'll ask him. - I meet with him from time to time. Okay? He helped my father out once. Yeah? And? (SIGHING) I can't. Fine. It's your choice. He's got control of my brother. He won't tell me where he is. - Brother? - I can't tell you anything else. Okay, I'm gonna get you out of this. - No. - Yeah. I'm gonna open up a can of whoop-ass - on this freak. - Jeremy, no. You can't. You can't do anything. If you do anything at all that makes it apparent that you know about this, my brother could be in serious danger. Don't worry. I'm gonna take care of it. (BELL TOLLING) (TREMULOUSLY) This is you being you. I get that. This is what you do. You bring us into this world, you make it incredibly hard to feel at home here, and then right when we finally realize that this is where we wanna be, you force us out. All part of your wonderful, unknowable plan. Look. She's dying. She thinks she's ready. But here's the thing. I'm not. And neither is our kid. You want me to pray? I'll pray. Please don't take her. She's got a few more paper chains to make for a few more Christmas trees. A few more birthday parties to arrange. Cupcakes to ice for a few more years. At least give us K through 12, I mean. It was just getting good. You want me back? Then you step up and show me what you can do for me. If you do, I'll do whatever you want. - Nick, we need to talk. - It sounds serious. It is. See, there comes a time in every mars life when he needs to step up, take matters into his own hands. - That time for me is right now. - Okay. Shoot. I need you to do something. - Uh. Well, what's that? - Nola Lyons. She's in trouble. Trouble? - Hey, Simon. - What kind of trouble? You know what? Lt'll sit. - Wait, wait. Jeremy, you didn't even. - No. No, no, no. It's cool. It's super cool. See you all around the quad. - Nick. - Simon. - What was that all about? - I have no idea. (CHUCKLES) Well, the signed partnership agreement between me and Tripp. You are stuck with me. (CHUCKLES SELF-CONTENTEDLY) It's official. COP: I got Chase Alexander here, bringing him over from county. Somebody needs to sign for the transfer. I'll go get the doctor. We werert expecting you. Okay, sunshine. Time to check out your room. (COP GROANS) (COP CHOKING) (ANDREA GROANS) All right. That's good. Now, I want you all to take meticulous notes. This patient's value as a research subject - can't be overstated. - What's going on here? - Brian. - Get away from her. Hey! What are you doing? She's not some science experiment, leeches. - Mr. Darling, this is a teaching. - And you're fired, Dr. Feelgood! Stop it, Brian. Stop it. As I was saying, this is a teaching hospital. When a case takes an unexpected turn, we invite the residents. What unexpected turn? Andrea's white count is up, marginally, and her CA-125s, undetectable. I don't understand. (WHISPERING) I'm getting better. We don't wanna get ahead of ourselves, but there definitely appears to be some improvement. The drug seems to be working. And for the first time since we began treatment, - there's reason to hope. - Hope, Brian. Nick? Anyone home? Nick? (DOOR SLAMS) Oh. - Who are you? - You don't remember? Oh, God. Did we. - You know. - I'm Ellers brother. Chase. (ENTHUSIASTICALLY) Oh, right. Ellers brother. Oh, I'm so sorry about her. - So, what are you doing here? - Um, I'm looking for Nick. You know, we had a tiff. Things were said. - Me, too. - Oh. Huh. You know, I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go, but could you. When you see him, could you do me a favor, and let him know that I. Have a gun. You have a gun. You have a gun. I. You know what? It's cool. I'm just gonna take off. - You're not going anywhere. - Okay. SIMON: Mmm-hmm. (DOOR SLAMS) Okay. Call you back. You wanted to see me? Yeah. I wanted to thank you for the Senate file you got for me. Once Patrick gets to D.C. It's gonna be very helpful. - You're welcome. Is that it? - No. No, I wanted to show you this. - What is it? - It's your brother's report card. He's quite a capable learner. Although his teachers, as you'll see, say he's having some issues with self-control. - When am I gonna be able to. - Talk to him again? Yeah, I've been thinking that it's about time to set up a chat, but given your own problem with self-control, I don't think you'd be such a good influence. I don't know what you're talking. You can't keep your mouth shut about our little arrangement. If you think you're gonna run to your boyfriend and get him to help save you, then clearly you don't know how to restrain yourself. Clearly you don't understand what the stakes are. Am I wrong? No. Good. Thank you for the respect of an honest answer. He is a smart kid. I know you're proud of him. I'm done. Money doesn't make you happy. You know that, right? Oh, boy, howdy. Had to lose my wife and sell my soul to Nick George to learn that lesson. Ruined my life, taking money from that jackass. - Sorry? - Yeah, you should be. All you Darlings. For perpetuating the lie that money fixes everything. You've got all of us, everywhere, chasing something that'll only make us miserable in the end. And Nick, he's the worst. He ties it all up in a pretty little bow and makes it seem like Christmas morning. Well, he's not really that bad. Ellen said you had a thing for him. She hated you, you know. Well, that's disappointing. I always thought of her as a friend. She would make fun of you, too. Your little crush on Nick. Guy's married with a kid, you keep trying to jump him anyway. You're a real slut, aren't you? (PHONE RINGING) Hello? - Where do you think you're going? - Nowhere. That's right. (BELL TOLLING) Okay. Okay. You frigging win. - Brian, what brings you here? - You can have me back. If you still want me. Well, it has little to do with me, Brian. But I'm sure the Lord is pleased. Well, that's what counts. Might I ask you what changed your mind? I had a revelation. Really? Of what nature? I realized my little foray into the world of Darling Enterprises wasrt getting me what I wanted. So that's when I decided that I could get what I'm looking for right here. What are you saying, Brian? What I'm saying is simple, Bishop Bascombe. I want your job. (LAUGHING) We're here live at Federal Hall, the first capital of the United States, the site of George Washingtors first inauguration, and today, Senator-Elect Patrick Darling's swearing-in ceremony. It is an unusual location for a freshman senator's inauguration, some would call it downright presumptuous, but we've come to expect nothing less from America's first family, the Darlings. "I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office "upon which I am about to enter." "Will well and faithfully." "Will well and faithfully." Doesrt that sound funny? It sounds perfect. Go on. "The office upon which I am about to enter, so help me God." "So help me God." Look at you. All right, here's the plan. I want you to wait outside. And when I'm coming down the stairs to be sworn in, I want you to sneak in behind me. And when I'm about to give my speech. Are you sure you wanna do this? I have never been more certain about anything in my entire life. This is our moment. - I love you. - I love you. Go. Go. Perfectly establishing. (WHISPERING) "I solemnly swear to take the oath." TRIPP: Patrick? - Dad. - That was Carmelita. That's right. And I plan to have her by my side for when I take the oath of office. And you thought springing this on us at the last minute. Was the only way to get it done, Nick. - Patrick. - This is my inauguration, gentlemen. My senate career, my life. Which, for all intents and purposes, we are more determined to preserve than he is. (CELL PHONE RINGING) What? Excuse me. Hello? (WO MAN'S VOICE BRIEFLY AUDIBLE) Hello? Lisa? (SHALLOW BREA THIN G) Are you in the house? - Hello? - He's. - Who is this? Are you okay? - He's... - Who is this? - Nick. Karen? Is that you? - Tripp, where's Karen? - I have no idea. With Letitia, probably. - NOLA: Jeremy! - Have you seen Nick? I got to find him. Listen, you didn't tell him about Simon and me, did you? - No. - Are you sure? - But I'm gonna as soon as I find him. - No, you can't tell him. You can't tell anyone. Listen, I'm sorry that I got you involved. No, you did the right thing. I told you, I'm gonna take care of it. - No. Jeremy, listen to me. - Let me go take care of it! Listen, this is. Ms. Lyons, there you are. - Everything okay? - Yes, everything is fine. I'm actually just gonna check in with the Senator. Why don't you. If I told you, you would have undertaken all these machinations to stop me, and I will not be stopped. Not this time. You're deranged. Suicidal. It's political suicide. Mr. Darling. This is your greatest achievement, Son. It is beyond my comprehension why you are so compelled - to sabotage it. - Mr. Darling, sir. Having Carmelita by my side after everything you've done to us - would be my greatest achievement. - Mr. Darling! - (SHOUTS) What? - We've got a situation. - Letitia. - Nicky. Is Karen with you? No. When I saw her this morning, she said she was headed to see you. Where did she go? Did she go to my house? - Yes. Why? - TRIPP: Nick, - we have a problem. - Yeah, I think so, too.
