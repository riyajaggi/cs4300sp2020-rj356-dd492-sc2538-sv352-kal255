 Mm.
 Dougie, what is wrong
with your arm?
 I don't know.
 Huh.
 I think it fell asleep.
 It's sort of tingly.
 I'm kind of tingly, too.
 I'm gonna go wash up, okay?

 What was
that noise, Dougie?
 Where are you?
 Dougie?
 Oh, my God.
 Dougie, what the hell?
 Where'd you get that suit...
 and haircut?
 Have you been wearing a rug
all this time, Dougie?
 Mm.
 Oh, my God,
are you sick, Dougie?
 Come on, we got to get
out of this house.
 Come on, Dougie!
 Dougie.
 Dougie, did you
forget something?
 Your shoes?
 I'll get them.
 Dougie!
 Could you quit fucking around?
 And put on your shoes.
Here.
 Put on your damn shoes!
 Come on, let's go.
 All right...
 You do have your keys, right?
 You mean Jade has to
give you two rides?
 Yeah, she just drove by
in a Wrangler.
 Looked like
maybe two people, but...
 his car's still here.
 I'm all set near the entrance.
 If he's in the car,
I'll get him here.
 Once you find your wallet
 or your cell phone,
 a pay phone or some money,
 you can call AAA, Dougie.
 They will help you.
 Jade give two rides.
 Oh, my God.
 Gene...
 he's not in the car.
 Yeah, he must still be inside.
 I'll load up his car.
 All right.
 I'll see you at Mikey's.
 One-one-nine!
 One-one-nine!
 One-one-nine!
 One-one-nine!
 What the hell, Billy?
 Oh, God,
something awful's in there.
 Dispatch.
 We need an ambulance.
 And tell them
to bring gas masks.
 There is something bad
in this vehicle.
 Come here.
 You'll be all right.
 We laid
everything out, Hawk,
 and we can't find
anything that's missing.
 If it's not here, then...
 how do you know
it's missing?
 But if it is here...
 then it isn't missing?
 This...
 is here.
 Let's sit down.
 Let--
 let me sit down.
 Let's start
from the beginning.
 - And--
- Don't say a thing.
 I need to think out loud.
 Something is missing,
and I need to find it.
 And the way I'm gonna find it
 has something to do
with my heritage.
 You're an Indian.
 Yes, Lucy.
 And apparently...
 that's the way I'm gonna
find what's missing.
 - Aah!
- What is it?
 - Aah!
- Are you okay, punky?
 I know what's missing!
 What's missing?
 The bunny!
 The bunny.
 I ate that bunny!
 That's missing.
 That's missing.
 Do chocolate bunnies
 have anything to do
with your heritage?
 No.
 It's not about the bunny.
 You ate the evidence, Lucy?
 I know!
 I never did it again.
 And I only ate one.
 And I never did it again.
 But I had a problem
at that time with--
 And I don't like to
say this in front of Andy.
 But I had a bubble...
 of gas.
 And I had read...
 ...that sometimes chocolate,
 which I love,
 can be used as a remedy,
 maybe by indigenous people.
 Is that true, Hawk?
 Do you use chocolate
as a remedy for gas?
 Do you want
another bunny, punky?
 I can get you more bunnies.
 It's not about the bunny.
 Is it about the bunny?
 No.
 It's not about the bunny.
 All right.
 Go inside, Dougie.
 Someone will help you
in there.
 - In there.
- Right.
 And I think you should try
to forget you ever met me.
 Shouldn't be too hard
for you.
 Now, here's $5.
 Call for help.
 Call for help.
 Right.
 And I think you should maybe
call a doctor or something
 because I think you might've had
a little stroke or something.
 Something.
 Yes.
 You can go out now.

 Dougie, go.

 Come on.
Let's go, Dougie.
 Right, right.

 In the back, Jack.
 Hey!
 You're gonna need
some change.
 Some change.
 Some change.
 Well, how do you want it?
You gonna play a game?
 Game.
 What game are you gonna play?

 The nutcake left.
 Joe, you watch this one.
 Hello!
 Oh! Oh!
 Albert?
 He's been
officially accused now
 of brutally murdering
his wife.
 He claims he's innocent
and knows who did it,
 but can't say because it would
breach national security.
 However...
 he got word to Chris here
that these items,
 which he placed
in his garden in Georgetown,
 are the clues to the identity
of the killer.
 The congressman's dilemma.
 All right, you all can
go get to work on this.
 And, Tammy, you stay
 and show me and Albert
what you found in New York.
 Thank you all.
 You're welcome.
 NYPD doesn't have a clue
what was going on here.
 They don't even know
who owns the place.
 Apparently there were
guards on duty 24-7,
 but they can't
find any of them--
 Only the victims--
Sam Colby, Tracey Barberato--
 have been ID'd.
 They confiscated
hundreds of digital files
 showing various angles
of this glass box.
 Once in a while, they show
some blurred shape pass through,
 but only a few frames.
 Then on the
night of the murders,
 on camera, this appears.
 What the hell?
 The other cameras saw nothing.
 And as soon
as this thing moved,
 it disappeared.
 Forensics?
 The bodies were
violently mutilated,
 but no prints,
no DNA, no fibers.
 Completely clean.
 Nothing.
 Director Cole?
 On your phone, it's Cooper.
 What?
 On your phone, it's Cooper.

 All right, we'll be out there
first thing tomorrow morning.

 Albert, we're headed
 for the Black Hills
of South Dakota.
 The Black Hills?
 Seriously?
 As happy as this news
makes us, Albert,
 we can't put this
on the radio.
 Perfect.
 I've been dying to see
Mount Rushmore.
 It's good you want to hurry.
 We fly at dawn,
 and, Tammy,
you're coming with us.
 The absurd mystery of the
strange forces of existence.
 How about a truckload
full of Valium?
