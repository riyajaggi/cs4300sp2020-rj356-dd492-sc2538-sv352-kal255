 Miriam. Go away, Richard! Hey, hey, I just want to talk to you. I already told the police it was you who ran over the little boy. - You already told the police? - Yes! Stay away, Richard! Tell anybody else? No. But I don't know why you're not arrested, so I also wrote a letter.

 What do you mean, a letter? I wrote a letter to the sheriff, Sheriff Truman, and mailed it, telling him everything I know, and I told him if anything happens to me, it was you who did it, so... there! Sent that letter today? That's right. Come here! Come here! Come here! Come here! Shut up! - Chad. - What's up? Listen, that little bitch Miriam

 sent a letter to the sheriff today. You got to intercept that motherfucker. Oh, that ain't gonna be real easy, Richard. What a pussy you are! Don't let that fucking letter get to the sheriff, you chickenshit, or I'll fuck you up bad. You're asking a lot there, pal. I'll try. You do more than try, fuck face. I'm taking off. Fuck! I will throw all of this shit out the window. Quit fucking speaking to me, and what I do or don't fucking do doesn't concern you. It's a fucking nightmare. I don't tell you shit like why the fuck you don't ask for a raise. How much money do you make, anyways? You barely make minimum wage! We can't even afford this shit hole. I don't tell you to clean this fucking place up! - Don't you fucking move. - Ah! Don't you fucking... Listen to me. Listen to me. Don't you give me that fucking innocent look. I know exactly what you did. Exactly what you did. You fuck... Ah, shit... Ah! Oh! - I've hurt you! - Candie! What happened? What happened? I'm so sorry! I'm sorry! Jesus! Rodney, let me see that. - It's all right! - Let me see this. Candie! What the fuck did you do, Candie? - Get off. Get off! - Keep off of me! Candie! What the... - Jesus Christ. - Easy. Easy. It's all right. It's all right. It's gonna be all right. Ah, it's bleeding a little bit. Is it all right? Is it bleeding? I got blood. Is it bleeding? Get away, Candie! Candie! Candie! Candie! Candie, let... Dougie, have a seat. All right. I'll, uh, examine you standing up. Anyway, as I told you, Dr. Ben, it started last week when Dougie disappeared for three days. He missed Sonny Jim's birthday party, which we'd been planning for six months, and then he shows up straight from the casino. You know about his gambling problems and then the drinking, and the drinking feeds the gambling and vice versa, and the whole thing is just a downward spiral. Dougie, have you been exercising? Exercising. You have lost a good amount of weight, also. - Also. - Go on. Well, he's just... I don't know... acting peculiar. Peeee-culiar. Uh, no, no, no. Dougie, I got to listen here. Dougie. No. Listen. No, Dougie. Dougie. Okay. Well... Dougie, your heart and lungs sound fantastic, so let's check your blood pressure. How much weight has he lost? I-I-I think he's lost a lot of weight. In a good way. Oh, yes. Dougie, last time I saw you, you were quite overweight. - Weight? - Yes. Overweight and, uh, headed for trouble. One ten over 70. Perfect. Remarkable. Remarkable. Candie. Candie, I'm fine. I-I'm okay. It's... - Paul, where do we go next? - Roll the dice, Sheena. - Local news! - Well, in local news, major excitement at a downtown hotel today... Brad. Brad! - Huh? - They got Ike. "The Spike" Stadtler. No shit. That asshole. Ike finally stepped on his dick. Brad, remind me to call off that hit on Ike. Save us a whack o' dough. Nice! Stadtler is a suspect in a number of gangland-related murders, including an attempt just yesterday on the life of this local businessman, Mr. Douglas Jones. Victim? Oh, no. That guy didn't act like any victim. Douglas Jones, he moved like a cobra. All I saw was a blur. Then we came down, and I was holding on to Dougie. We were having a regular conversation about his money and insurance and-and... No, Dougie, don't do that. And we were just walking along, minding our own business, and I held on to him, and then, out of nowhere, someone came right at us, pointing a gun at my husband, and we were just... Dougie! He wa... he started... The gun went off, and it scared me, and my Dougie, he gave him a good old karate chop in the throat, and I punched him a couple times. I said, "Don't you touch... Just get off him!" Get off him!" And then we... he ran off! I don't know where he went, and it was... it was just... Freeze it there. You just took care of business, right, Doug... That's our Mr. Jackpots, Rodney. I think you're right, Bradley. Turns out, our Mr. Jones is actually... Mr. Jones. What a fuckin' world. How... can you ever... love me... after what-what I... What I did? Dougie. Do you find me attractive? Well? Do you? I find you attractive. Dougie. Dougie! Oh, yes. Oh. Yes, Dougie. Yes. Dougie. Dougie! Dougie! Dougie. Dougie. Dougie! Dougie! Dougie! Dougie! Dougiiieee! Dougie. Oh, Dougie. Dougie? I love you. Love you. Dougie. And the fucks are at it again! Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help! We're sheep to these monsters, and they don't give a shit! We grow our wool, and just when we're getting warm, they come along with their electric clippers and shear our wool off, and we're just naked, screaming little fucks! No wool for us! Freezing and hungry! In the night. In the dark. And they don't give a shit! Then when we get sick, the pharmaceutical companies make billions! They own the fucking hospitals. Filled to the brim. They own the morgues! They own the embalming fluids! They own the mortuaries, the graveyards! These fucks! Is it the government's business who we marry? What the fuck do we care what the government thinks about who we marry? Are we gonna invite them to the wedding? Fuck no! Oh, they wouldn't come anyway. They're-they're too busy fucking! Fucking us at the grocery store! At the bank! At the gas pump! They're feeding our children chemical shit coated in sugar! Why don't these monsters bite into those tasty treats themselves? 'Cause they'll die in the streets! Just like us! And then they'll bloat like a big red fucking balloon. Stop! Stop distracting yourself with all this diverting bullshit, and pay attention. Save the children! Every parent wants to save their child. Buy yourself a shovel, dig yourself out of the shit, and get educated! Oh, he's so beautiful. Sonny Jim, go get in the car. I can't stop thinking about last night. You're so wonderful. - Wonderful. - Mm. I just had to tell you that. Okay. Let's get you to work. You can't fool me! I've been here before! What are you doing up here, Chad? I'm... thinking what a beautiful day it is, Lucy. I'll bet you're a girl who appreciates a beautiful day. - Well... - I bet you and Andy wake up each morning and say, "Oh, what a beautiful day it is." That depends on what time it is. I mean, sometimes there's not even enough time to think of anything. One time, Andy was even thinking that the clock had stopped, and then we realized that we didn't even know what time it was. It seemed like forever. - When... - Oh. I'm going out, Lucy. I-I see the mailman. I'm gonna collect the mail. But he'll bring it in. Well, I'm gonna save him the trouble and go out and enjoy this beautiful day. Ah, thank you so much. Beautiful day. This calls for another doughnut. Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Uh, Mrs. Horne? Your grandson, Richard, is on his way in. Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Don't even think of getting out of your car, Richard. - Came to see you, Grandma. - Stay away! - Or I'll call the sheriff! - Come on, Grandma. No! Stop it! I just want a couple of dollars. No! Just want a couple of dollars. No. Go ask your grandfather. He won't give you any more, will he? Hello, Johnny. I got money, but I want more. You always wanted me to leave town, right? So help me out, and I'll be out of here. Don't come any closer, Richard. I mean it. - Money, Grandma! - No! Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Oh, Johnny! Hello, Johnny. I... I will squeeze the shit out of you, bitch! How are you today? You cocksucking bitch! And I'll cornhole that piece of shit! Now give me some fucking money! In-in my purse! Not your purse, bitch! The safe. The combination. The combination! - What did you do? - What? - Four... - What? Fucking speak up. I cannot understand a fucking thing you're saying. Nine... zero... four... Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Seven. Stay there! Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Oh, Johnny. Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Oh, I'm so sorry. - Look at you. - How are you today? Oh, we can't make him mad. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Oh, my God. Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Johnny... Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Yeah. Yeah, I will take your purse. Here. Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Why you have to make something so simple so fucking difficult? Cunt. Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Oh, Johnny. Oh, Johnny. Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? Hello, Johnny. How are you today? It's true. It's all over the news. They got Ike. Okay. Thank you, Roger. Anthony, come here. Don't sit down, Anthony. Anthony, I asked you here because you're a creative individual, and you're gonna need every ounce of that creativity to do what I'm about to tell you. What's that, Mr. Todd? Do you recall my business rivals and bitter enemies the Mitchum brothers? You're gonna visit the brothers now. You're gonna pin the blame for the insurance claim that we conspired to deny for them, a loss of 30 million that hit 'em hard, on the back of Douglas Jones. You're gonna convince them that Mr. Jones has it out for the brothers, a personal vendetta, and then we're gonna sit back, and we're gonna watch as the Mitchum brothers take care of our Mr. Jones problem. - But what if... - Don't speak, Anthony. If you fail to deliver on this, then you'll have to kill Mr. Jones yourself. Albert and the lady from the morgue. - Sweet. - Sweet. Yes. Yes, I... Come on. What's he want? - Who? - That insurance fuck. It's after midnight. The bastard. I could throw a car farther than I'd trust that rat fuck. Anthony Sinclair here to see you. Stay put. We'll come get him. Candie. Candie, go get him. Candie! Yes, sir. Candie, go get him. You want me to bring him here? Yeah. What did he just say? You want me to get him and bring him here? What the fuck? Did we ask her to tell him her life story? For four fuckin' hours? Warrick? Send Candie in here, with him, now. Now! Candie. They're ready. She's on her way. - I know. - We fire her, - she's got no place to go. - I know. I... Here he is. What the fuck were you guys talking about? She was talking. - Candie? - Hmm? What were you talking about to him out there on the floor? Candie! Um... Oh... that we're in the version layer, that it's gonna be hot and smoggy tomorrow, and I told him that we are so lucky to have air-conditioning cooling our casino. Okay. Mr. Insurance Man, what do you want? Mr. Mitchum. Mr. Mitchum. I'm here to tell you something that you will want to know about. - Yeah? - What's that? Your new hotel, which burned badly down to the ground a few months back, was ruled arson by an official investigation. Now, I may have sold you your policy, sirs, but I didn't handle the claim. It was done by Douglas Jones, who works at our firm. - Douglas Jones. - I thought you should know from me, unofficially, on my own... that this Mr. Jones did everything in his power to prevent you gentlemen from getting the insurance relief from the loss you suffered that I believe to this day you deserved. Douglas Jones seems to have a personal vendetta against you. And he still insists that that claim will never be paid out, and he'll do everything in his power to make sure that it never happens. - Yeah? - Is that it? Yes, sir. You have an enemy in Douglas Jones. That's what I came to tell you. Candie, show him out. Candie! You have an enemy... in Douglas Jones. Now I know... how Brando felt. Calling him tomorrow, this Douglas Jones... to set up a meeting. Right you are, Rodney. - Right you are. - He took us... for 30 million... 447 thousand... dollars. Motherfucker. You fuck us once, shame on us. You fuck us twice, shame on you. You're dead. Yeah. Laura! Albert. Come on in. Diane received this text on her phone at 11:13 this morning. "Around the dinner table, the conversation is lively." Now, that came in after Cooper escaped. It pinged off a cell tower in Philly, so at first, I thought it was one of her boyfriends... Seems she has a stable of male suitors... But Tammy traced this one back from there to a server in Mexico. Mexico? Did she respond? She sent the following heavily encrypted message: "They have Hastings. He's going to take them to the site." Doesn't sound like boyfriend talk. I felt it when she hugged me, but this confirms it. What should we do? Keep her close. Damn. - Tammy. - Gordon. Come on in. You remember the penthouse murders in New York City? Yes? This was just found on one of the earliest cards. Dale! This is something. This is really something. What did he do? He came in and attacked us and stole all my money! Oh, damn it. Is Johnny okay? No concerns for me, as usual. What do you mean, Johnny? It was me he attacked. Sylvia, of course I'm concerned about you too. How much money did he take? Everything I had in the safe, thousands of dollars, and you're going to make this up to me. No, I am not sending you any more money, Sylvia! Yes, you are! - Sylvia! - Yes, you are. I'm calling my lawyer right now. Beverly? Do you want to have dinner with me? Hawk. Electricity is humming. You hear it in the mountains and rivers. You see it dance among the seas and stars and glowing around the moon, but in these days, the glow is dying. What will be in the darkness that remains? The Truman brothers are both true men. They are your brothers. And the others, the good ones who have been with you. Now the circle is almost complete. Watch and listen to the dream of time and space. It all comes out now, flowing like a river. That which is and is not. Hawk. Laura is the one. You know the one.
