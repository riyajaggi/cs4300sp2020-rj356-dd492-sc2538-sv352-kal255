 Now... I can only
give you a short visit.
 Thank you, Dave.
 George says they're not
gonna let you out on bail.
 I'm...
 I'm in so much trouble.
 I have...
 I have to tell you something.
 I wasn't there,
 but I h...
 I had a dream that night
 that...
 That I was in her apartment.
 You were there.
 Your fingerprints are there.
 No, I sw... I swear
to you, I wasn't there.
 I swear to you, it was a dream!
 Fuck you.
 You fucking bastard!
 I've known about this affair.
 I've known about this affair all along.
 Now, you lookee here.
 I know about you and George
 and maybe somebody else too!
 You're going down.
 Life in prison, Bill.
 Life in prison.
 Good-bye, Bill.
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, my...
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, my...
 Oh, my God.
 George.
 Phyllis.
 How is he?
 He knows.
 Don't walk me out.
 I'll see you later at my place.
 How's he doing?
 Well, he's, uh,
 pretty shook up, I have to admit.
 And Phyllis?
 She's had a really rough day, I believe.
 Yes. I understand.
 Oh, my God.
 Oh.
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, my God.
 What are you doing here?
 You did good.
 You follow human nature perfectly.
 This is George's gun.
 _
 Roger, come in here.
 Tell her she has the job.
 Mr. Todd?
 Yes, Roger?
 Can I ask you a question?
 Go ahead.
 Why do you let him make you...
 do these things?
 Roger...
 you better hope
 that you never get involved
with someone like him.
 Never have someone like him
 in your life.
 Jack, you barely touched
your three dinners.
 Darya said something about you,
 uh, being worried about tomorrow?
 Or the day after?
 I'm not worried, Ray,
 about anything.
 Well, that's good.
 For a while, day after tomorrow,
 I'll need to be on my own.
 That might be a good
time for you to learn
 how to mind your own business.
 Well...
 meantime, there's
anything I can do to help,
 just let me know.
 I'll be sure to let you know, Ray.
 And I'll follow up on
that contact of mine,
 hopefully get the information you need.
 Want,
 not need.
 I don't need anything, Ray.
 If there's one thing you should know
 about me, Ray,
 it's that I don't need anything.
 I want.
 And I want that information.
 Kind of funny that she'll
only give it to you.
 This information seems
pretty important to you.
 Don't worry. I'll get it for you.
 And I better be able to
trust that information.
 She's Hastings' secretary.
 She knows what he knows.
 Margaret?
 Hawk.
 Where are you walking tonight?
 Once again, your log and
I are on the same page.
 Supposed to be something
happening here tonight.
 The stars turn...
 and the time presents itself.
 Hawk,
 watch carefully.
 I will, Margaret.
 I'm too weak to go with you.
 But stop by.
 I have coffee and pie for you.
 Gonna have to be after.
I'm almost there now.
 Please, let me know what happens.
 I will, Margaret.
 Good night, Margaret.

 Are you Laura Palmer?
 _
 _

 Who are you?
 _

 But Laura Palmer is dead.
 _

 When can I go?
 Whisper.

 Jack, come here.
 Shit.
 He's coming. I have
to get off the phone.
 Hi, baby.
 Who you talking to?
 Um, Jack.
 Just making sure I get the job done
 on the secretary's car.
 Mm.
 What did Jack say?
 He said it's all good to go.
 I'm happy to see you.
 I thought maybe you'd
 gone off on your own for a while,
 like you were saying.
 You're happy to see me, Darya?
 Yeah, baby.
 That's nice, Darya.
 Ray was supposed to
meet me this afternoon.
 - He never showed.
- Oh, yeah?
 Yeah.
 Where's that 45 of yours, Darya?
 I've got it here by the bed.
 What's up?
 Might want to borrow it for a job.
 What's mine is yours.
 Darya, Jack is dead.
 I killed Jack two hours
ago after he wired the car.
 Don't move...
 one muscle.
 I'm gonna play something for you, Darya.
 I think we'll both
find this interesting.
 Darya, is that you?
 Ray, where the hell are you?
 Federal prison, South Dakota.
 What the fuck? What did you do, Ray?
 Carried weapons over the state line.
 I fucked up, the worst possible moment.
 How are you calling me?
 This is a burner. Don't worry about it.
 Nobody's listening.
 So what do we do about Cooper?
 I got another call from Jeffries.
 You have to hit Cooper if he's
still around tomorrow night.
 That means you now,
Darya. You have to do this.
 Fuck.
 Fuck, I think his car just pulled up.
 Fuck!
 Let's see what happens tomorrow.
 If I have to, I'll take him out.
 Shit, he's coming. I
got to get off the phone.
 Shh.
 Are you going to kill me?
 Yes, Darya.
 Shit!
 Darya...
 who hired you and Ray to kill me?
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I swear, I don't...
 Hmm?
 Ray knows.
 I don't know. He never told me.
 Do you really expect
me to believe that Ray's
 in prison for carrying
guns over a state line?
 Darya, look at me.
 This is quite an interesting
thing to think about.
 The game begins.
 Did he say why they want me dead?
 No, I don't know why.
 How much do they want me
dead? What are they paying you?
 We'd split a half a million.
 I wouldn't have done it.
 I just said that to Ray.
 Shut up, Darya.
 But...
 you said you were going
away somewhere tomorrow.
 Tomorrow,
 I'm supposed to get pulled back
 into what they call the Black Lodge.
 But I'm not going back there.
 I've got a plan for that one.
 But this prison thing
with that fucker Ray...
 Darya, did Ray get that information
 from Hastings' secretary?
 Did he ever mention coordinates to you?
 I don't know what that is.
 Geographical coordinates,
numbers, letters.
 They could save your life.
 He said she told him something,
but I don't know what.
 Anybody ever show this to you before?
 Do you know what this is?
 Huh?
 Did you ever see anything like this?
 This is what I want.
 Are you gonna kill me now?
 Yes, Darya.
 Phillip?
 You're late.
 Couldn't be helped.
 I missed you in New York,
 but I see you're still in Buckhorn.
 And you're still
nowhere, is that correct?
 You met with Major Garland Briggs.
 How did you know that?
 Phillip?
 Actually, I just called to say good-bye.
 This is Phillip Jeffries, right?
 You're going back in tomorrow,
 and I will be with Bob again.
 Who is this?
 _
 Yeah?
 It's me.
 I need you to clean up in room six.
 Everything.
 Darya?
 That's good news.
 I was getting so jealous of that bitch.
 Then go get your husband.
 I need you and Hutch in a certain area
 in a few days.
 I'll get word to you.
 Okay, boss.
 Chantal,
 come here.
 Oh.
 You're nice and wet.
 Mm.

 Weird.
 Where is he?
 Does this, by any
chance, mean that I can
 go in there with you?
 I brought us two lattes again.

 Great place, isn't it?
 Yeah, it's the dog's bollocks in here.
 - What kind of beer do you want?
- Oh, I'll have whatever.
 Two ice-cold Colonials.
 No, you guys,
 my daughter is with the wrong guy.
 Are you kidding me?
Everybody loves Steven.
 You don't know Becky. I
can see it on her face.
 There is something really wrong.
 It's her life.
 ? Can you hear me ?
 ? Can you hear me ?
 Hey, over there.
 There's James. He's
staring at you again.
 Does James have a thing for you?
 There's something wrong with that guy.
 There's nothing wrong with him.
 James was in a motorcycle accident.
 He's just quiet now.
 James is still cool.
 He's always been cool.
 ? For the last time ?
 ? For the last time ?
 ? For the last time ?
 ? At night I'm driving in your car ?
 ? Pretending that
we'll leave this town ?
 ? We're watching all
the streetlights fade ?
 ? And now you're just
a stranger's dream ?
 ? I took your picture
from the frame ?
 ? And now you're
nothing like you seem ?
 ? Your shadow fell
like last night's rain ?
