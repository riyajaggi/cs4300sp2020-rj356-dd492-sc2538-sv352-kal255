 I think I'm high! Oh, good Lord, Jerry. I don't know where I am! This is what I found. From Laura Palmer? Yeah. "This came to me in a dream last night. My name is Annie. I've been with Dale and Laura. The good Dale is in the lodge, and he can't leave. Write it in your diary." Unquote. "Dale" as in Special Agent Dale Cooper? Right. What do you think this means?

 I don't know, but I'm sure this is what the Log Lady wanted me to find. I think that "Annie" is Annie Blackburn, a... a girl that went into that place. And these pages are for sure from Laura's diary? Yeah, these are from her diary, the diary found at her friend Harold Smith's. These are three of the four pages that we saw were torn out, missing. And there's... There's still one missing. And how do you think they got here, inside our bathroom stall door? I'm not sure, but look at this. "It's 1:30 a.m. I'm crying so hard, I can hardly breathe. Now I know it isn't Bob. I know who it is." I'm sure it was Leland who hid these pages. He found 'em and realized that she knew. Well, I remember this. Leland Palmer, her father. When do you think he hid these? I don't know. Leland came into the station several times. Once around that time, we brought him in for the questioning of the murder of Jacques Renault. Maybe he thought we were gonna frisk him, and that's when he hid 'em. Laura never met Cooper. He came here after she died, didn't he? She said that these words from Annie came to her in a dream. This thing she said... "the good Dale is in the lodge" and can't come out. But Harry saw Cooper come out of the lodge with Annie that night. Doc and Harry took him over to the Great Northern, but if the good Cooper is in the lodge and can't come out, then the one who came out of the lodge with Annie that night... was not the good Cooper. And he left town soon after. Who else saw him that day? Well, like I said, Doc Hayward, but I don't know who else. Let's bring Harry up to speed, see what he thinks. Can you get him for me? I'd be happy to wait. Harry. Where the hell they got ya? Oh, no kidding. Damn. I'm sorry, Harry. Uh, just wanted to talk to you about a few things. Oh. Right. W... Get some rest. I'll check in later. No, nothing urgent. Don't worry about it. Just get rest, and... and, Harry, do me a favor. Beat this thing. All right, brother. Later. - But that's your truck. - I know it's my truck. I can't talk to you about this here. I told you. Please go away. But if you weren't driving, I need to know who was. I'll tell you. I'll tell you the whole story. I'll meet you somewhere, but I can't talk to you here. Please, you've got to get out of here now. The logging road above Sparkwood and 21. By Jones'? Just past Jones', down by the creek. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I know it. See you there. Um, I-I'll meet you there in two hours. 4:30, then. P-please leave. Please leave now. Is that you, Doc? This is Sheriff Frank Truman calling. Good to hear your voice. Where's Harry? Harry's, uh, a little under the weather these days. Yeah? Well, give my best to him. Uh, do you know what Skype is, Doc? I use it all the time. Just the other day, I diagnosed Mrs. Mueller's eczema. Never had to get out of my chair. What's your Skype handle, Doc? I'll, uh, saddle up. MiddleburyDoc. Be right with you, Doc. Now. There you are, Doc. What's this all about? Doc, do you remember way back when, the night Harry called you in to examine Special Agent Dale Cooper at the Great Northern? I can't remember what I had for breakfast this morning, but I remember that. Tell me what you remember. Well, we all knew Coop, but that morning he was acting mighty... strange. And? I took him to the hospital, and I had him checked out while I made my rounds. About an hour later, I saw him sneaking out of intensive care, fully dressed. He... he turned, and... And he looked at me, and... I saw that strange face again. I called out to him, but he didn't say a word. He just turned around and walked out. What was he doing in intensive care? I-I thought at the time he might have been looking in on Audrey Horne. That terrible business at the bank, and... She was in a coma. How they biting back there, Doc? You know, just the other morning, I caught two brown trout in my pajamas. Yeah? How they got in my pajamas, I'll... I'll never know. Did you make a breakfast out of them? Panfried 'em right out there by the river. I had some scrambled eggs and... and an English muffin with huckleberry jam. Yeah. Mighty good talking to you, Doc. I'll give your good wishes to Harry. Whatever this is about, well, I hope it turns out all right for you. Keep working the sunny side of the river, Doc. Ah... so long, Frank. Detective Macklay? I'm Lieutenant Knox. Oh, yes, Lieutenant. It's good to meet you. Detective. Thanks for seeing me. This shouldn't take long. You submitted a set of fingerprints a few days ago to our database, and we need to verify the source. Well, I can show them to you, but our search was blocked. That must have been from your end? I'd like to see the prints, please. Where did you lift them from... A crime scene? No. Off the body. There's a body? There's a body, all right. Where's the rest of him? We don't know. How old was this man? Late 40s. When did this man die? Within the last five or six days. You're sure this is the body you took those prints from? Yeah. I'm happy to pull 'em again for you, if you like. It would sure help our investigation to know who this is. Excuse me for a moment. Sir. Lieutenant Knox, sir. It's not just prints this time. It's a body. It's him. You're sure? The prints came off this body. Okay. Okay. I have to make that other call. There's just one thing, sir. What's that? Actually, two things. The head is missing. And he's the wrong age. What do you mean, Cindy? What I mean is that his head is not here. It's missing, and the body is that of a man in his late 40s who died a few days ago. If he died recently, Major Briggs should be in his 70s. There must be some mistake. I've seen the body myself. Coroner verified the age and the prints. Stay there. I'll get back to you. I'm making that other call now. Yes, sir. No one else gets access to this body. You care to share any of this with us? You didn't hear it from me... but I don't think this is going to be your investigation for too much longer. Yes? Come in. How did it go? Not well. I said, "Hello, Diane." She said, "This is about Cooper, isn't it?" I said, "Maybe." She said, and I quote, "No fucking way." Oh. I was at home, dripping wet, on the verge of pneumonia 15 minutes later. How was your evening, Chief? This is not good news, Albert. She needs to see him. Your turn. But you'll go with me? - Say "please." - What? You heard me. Please. FBI, champ. Friends of Diane. Come on in. Who is it? Oh, my God. See you later, Diane. Yeah, see you later. Well, this won't take long. I'm just gonna say the same thing to you I said to him. Now, take it easy, Diane, and let's just sit down and have a nice, simple chat. - You got any coffee? - No. I don't have any cigarettes either. Ah, the memory of tobacco. But I gave it up. Fuck you, Gordon. Now you're getting the personal treatment. Oh, you want personal? Fuck you, too, Albert. Now that we got the pleasantries out of the way. I never even got this far. Diane, your former boss and former Special Agent Dale Cooper is in a federal lockup in South Dakota. Good. Diane, this may require a slight change of attitude on your part. My attitude is none of your fucking business. Tough cookie. Always was. Thank you, Diane. Damn good coffee. So? Say what you came here to say. We have a feeling something is wrong. We don't know exactly what it is, but we need someone else who knows him extremely well to have a talk with him and afterwards tell us what you think. This is extremely important, Diane, and it involves something that you know about, and that's enough said about that. Federal prison... South Dakota. Judge not, lest ye be judged. Listen, just the fact that you're here speaks louder than words. Fuck you, Albert. Look at this. Cooper 25 years ago... Cooper in prison two days ago. Identical, right? Maybe. What do you see? This code mark's on the wrong side. What does that tell you? That some Cro-Magnon at the prison tried to line this up to make it look like the original, but he had to reverse the print to do it. YREV, the backwards word. What does this all mean? Tammy, you've been doing excellent work, passing one test after another. Put out your hands. Flip 'em over. "I'm very, very happy to see you again, old friend." This is the spiritual mound, the spiritual finger. You think about that, Tammy. That's the only known photograph we have of Cooper in the last 25 years. That's outside of Rio... His house. By the time we checked it out, it belonged to some girl from Ipanema. Looks like the man we met in prison. The man we met in prison. Ten minutes. And I speak to him alone. Ten minutes, tops, or it's over when I say it's over. That's exactly the way it's gonna be, Diane. You'll control the curtain and the microphone. And we're very appreciative. What'd you say your name was, again? Tammy. Fuck you, Tammy. I knew it was going to be you. It's good to see you again, Diane. Oh, yeah? When was that, Cooper? When did we see each other last? Are you upset with me, Diane? What do you think? I think you're upset with me. When was the last time we saw each other, Cooper? At your house. That's right. Do you remember that night? I'll always remember that night. Same for me. I'll never forget it. Who are you? I don't know what you mean, Diane. Look at me. Look at me. Thank you, Warden Murphy. - That's it? - Looks like it. Hold this man till you hear from us. Diane? Listen to me. That is not the Dale Cooper that I knew. Please tell me exactly what you mean. It isn't time passing... or how he's changed... or the way he looks. It's something here. There's something that definitely isn't here. That's good enough for me, Diane. That's good enough for me. That last night you mentioned in there... Something I need to know about? You and I'll have a talk sometime. You and I will have a talk. Okay? Okay. Cheers. To the FBI. Listen to me a minute. Tell Warden Murphy I have a message for him. I need to speak with him in his office. Yeah, right. Just tell him we need to speak about a strawberry. Sit him down and leave. I've turned off the security cameras. We can speak freely... and privately. The dog leg. That dog had four legs. One you found in my trunk. The other three went out with the information you're thinking about right now. Two people you don't want coming around here if anything bad happens to me. How do I know you know anything about... this? Joe McCluskey. What do you want? I want a car. Cheap rental, if you like. For myself and Ray Monroe. I want a friend in the glove compartment... One a.m. tonight. Smooth and safe. And if your mind should wander to a place where I might not make it out of here alive, remember the dog legs. I'm not interested in you. You'll never see me again, and no one will ever hear anything more about Joe McCluskey or your late Mr. Strawberry. Is there a reason you're not talking to me, Dougie? Hmm? What were you and Bushnell discussing earlier? I saw you... walk into his office carrying a bunch of files. Uh, some police officers are here to see you, Dougie. Police. That reminds me of that call I have to make. Police. You want them to come in here? Okay. Mr. Jones? Detectives Fusco. Badge. What's going on here? Who are you, ma'am? I'm his wife. What's going on here? We're here about his car. That's why I'm here. What do you mean by that? I'm picking him up. He doesn't know where his car is. Was it stolen? Dougie, was your car stolen? Stolen. Did you report it stolen, sir? Sir. Did you report your car as a stolen vehicle? No, he did not report it stolen. I would know. His car went missing. We haven't seen it. Isn't that your department? Yes, it is, once it's reported as missing. Well, I guess this is as good a time as any. He doesn't know where the car is. He hasn't seen it in a few days, so, yes, there's a very strong possibility that it was stolen. Stolen. All right, then, Mr. Jones, where did you last leave your car? Well, if we knew that, we'd know where to find it, wouldn't we? Okay, can you describe your vehicle, please? Ah, it's a terrible car, always in the shop... Silver, four-door, cheap Ford, the kind they call down at that dealer a "previously owned" car. When, uh, did the car go missing? Dougie? Dougie. A few days ago. Few... days ago. Is there a reason why you didn't report your car missing? Reason? Yeah, I'll tell you a reason. There's more to life than cars. Too many cars, too much going on, and Dougie's been under a lot of stress lately, and if you want to know the truth, so have I. Officers, have you found the car? Who are you, sir? He owns this place. Bushnell Mullins. Dougie works for me. You did find his car, didn't you? The car has been found. It was involved in an apparent explosion. Multiple fatalities. Why didn't you tell us that to begin with? The deceased individuals had ties to a gang associated with multiple car thefts. Well, there's your answer. Now, if you don't mind, our son's home alone waiting for his supper, and in case you think we're neglecting him, he's being watched by our neighbor as a favor, and we'd like to go. We were supposed to be home by now at the end of a very long and stressful day, which I'll tell you about later, Dougie. - Come on, let's go. - Hold on. And I'm sure our being here hasn't made your day any easier, ma'am, but we're gonna need you to fill out some paperwork. Which we can take care of at your convenience. Please, give us a call in the morning. And, uh, thank you for your cooperation. Have a pleasant evening. Evening. Well... I guess he won't have any trouble collecting the insurance, huh? I have some questions about those files you covered for me, Dougie. But you go ahead. We can take care of that tomorrow. Thanks, Mr. Mullins. Thank you... Mullins. So I met with them. I told them what the arrangements were gonna be, and I gave them more than they deserved, and that's the end of them, okay? Now, with this car business, yes, there's gonna be some insurance money. I don't know how much, but, Dougie, just think. If you hadn't blown that money gambling... $25,000 plus the insurance... We could have gotten you a great new car. Now who knows what we'll get? But I do not want you running off and gambling any more of that jackpot. That money is for Sonny Jim and our future. Just 'cause you have it now doesn't mean you can just run off and risk one more penny. Do you hear me? No more gam... Get off him! Squeeze his hand off. Squeeze his hand off. Squeeze his hand off. Dougie! Are you guys okay? Oh, my God. Are you okay? Oh, Dougie. What... Are you okay? And he just... he just... Dougie took right over, and he just chopped him right in the throat and said, "You get off," and I kicked him, and I punched him, and that was it, and... and Dougie just took care of business. Right, baby? It was... it was terrible. What about the man with the gun? He ran right at me. Almost knocked me down. He smelled funny. Victim? Oh, no. That guy didn't act like any victim. Douglas Jones... He moved like a cobra. All I saw was a blur. When did you first start hearing this? Sometime last week. But I think it's louder now. Maybe that's 'cause nobody's here. Don't move. Just listen carefully. Where do you think... it's coming from? Eh? Now... now it sounds like it's coming from over there, no? It sure does. No. No, it's not here either. Eh? Oh, this might be of interest. It came in the mail today. Wow. My God. That's an old one. We switched to cards over 20 years ago. Room 315. Wait a minute. I think that was the room where Agent Cooper was shot. Who's Agent Cooper? FBI. He was here, I don't know, maybe 25 years ago... investigating the murder of Laura Palmer. Who's Laura Palmer? Oh, that, my dear... is a long story. Have maintenance, uh, check out that hum in the morning. It's getting way past quitting time. Thank you, Mr. Horne. Ben. Good night, Ben. Beverly. Hmm. Hi. Sorry I'm late. How is he? We had kind of a rough day. He's better, but I had to give him extra pain medication. Okay. Thank you. Oh, has he eaten yet? He was waiting. - Dinner is on the stove. - Okay. He's missing you. I'll see you tomorrow, Marge. Sorry I'm late, honey. Are you hungry? I heard you drive up. Why were you late? I had some things to do. Would you like your dinner? What things? I had some work to do. Some things came up, and I needed to do them. Are you hungry? Not really. Listen to me, Tom. I know you're sick and suffering. I know it. But do not use that to fuck with me. Do not fuck with me! I didn't want to go back to work. Do you know how goddamn lucky I am to have this job to help us survive? Oh, for crying out loud, do not fuck this up, Tom! Yeah, Roadhouse. Jean Michel. Uh-huh. Yeah, of course he loved it. Who wouldn't? What? Two. I sent him two. He owes me for two. What? I don't know their names. Uh, he wanted blondes. I sent him two blondes. What? Fuck, I... How old? They had IDs. They both had good IDs. Look, this has nothing to do with the Roadhouse. Roadhouse has been owned by the Renault family for... For 57 years. We're not gonna lose it now because of a... A couple of 15-year-old straight-A students. No, no. I'll tell you... Those two girls were... Were whores, pure and simple. Ah, from what I hear, though, they were straight-A whores. He owes me for two. It's the beige rental. Here's your phone. Keys are in the car. You drive. Hey! Has anybody seen Bing? Nope. No.
