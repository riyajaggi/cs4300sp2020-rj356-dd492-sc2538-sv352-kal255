 I told you to be on your
way half an hour ago, sir.
 There's no loitering here.
 What's your name, sir?
 What's your name, sir?
 Dougie Jones.
 And where do you live, Mr. Jones?
 Home.
 And where is home?
 No-no-no-no. Don't touch the badge.
 Manzella.
 Manzella Court?
 Red door.
 Have you been drinking, sir?
 Any drugs or medications?
 Have you taken anything?
 Case file.
 Come with me.
 Come on.
 Just a second.
 Dougie?
 Ma'am, do you know this man?
 Uh, yes, of course I do.
 He's my husband, Dougie Jones.
 Where have you been?
 He seems a little disoriented.
 That's on a good day.
 He has no identification,
and he wasn't able
 to give me the street address.
 He only knew the house
by the color of the door.
 Oh... thank you, very much,
 officers, for bringing him home.
 Come on, sweetheart.
 Let's get you in.
 Badge.
 Yes, that's my badge, sir, yeah.
 Yeah, he...
 He's got this thing for
my badge, I don't know...
 He likes...
 Thank you. Thank you, officer.
 Come on in.
 Uh, ma'am?
 There's an envelope here for you.
 Oh.
 Thank you again.
 Good night.
 Good night, ma'am.
 Dougie, I'm sorry, I forgot, your car.
 Where is your car?
 Have you eaten?
 Come on. I'm gonna fix you a sandwich.
 Tomorrow lunchtime, I'm
taking you to see Dr. Ben.
 He needs to take a good look at you.
 Look at you.
 And what are these?
 Case files.
 Case files.
 And this one...
 there's nothing written on it.
 Okay, Dougie,
 you need to go upstairs
 and say good night to Sonny Jim.
 He's been waiting up for you.
 Up for you.
 Go upstairs and say
good night to Sonny Jim.
 Upstairs!
 Dougie.
 I already brushed my teeth.
 Can I leave my cowboy light on?
 Will you stay with me
until I fall asleep?
 Asleep.
 Dad.
 Dad.
 Dougie!
 Get down here right now!
 Right now!
 Mom! He was gonna stay with me!
 Not tonight, he isn't.
 Mommy will be up soon, honey.
 Get down here, right now!
 You are in the doghouse, mister.
 You were supposed to call them
 and set up a time to pay them off,
 and look, this shows up!
 Do you have an explanation for this?
 Jade.
 Jade?
 So that's her name, is it?
 Jade give two rides.
 I'll bet she did.
 And you admit you know her.
 Look at you two, holding
each other like that.
 Are you gonna answer that?
 Maybe it's Jade calling!
 Jade.
 Oh, my God, Dougie.
 We are not done with this.
 Hello?
 Doug Jones.
 Who is this?
 Doug... Jones.
 He's indisposed.
 Did you get our envelope?
 Yes, I did, thank you very much.
 Now, you listen to me.
 How much does he owe you?
 Did he tell you?
 No, he didn't tell me.
 I'm just finding out
about all this right now.
 Fifty thousand.
 A... and how's he supposed to get that?
 Hmm? Who can get that kind of money?
 And what if he doesn't have it?
 What are you gonna do
then? Break his legs?
 Think about it, it's hard enough
to get that kind of money,
 let alone with broken legs.
 Fifty thousand dollars, past due.
 It'd be real smart for Mr. Jones
 to have that on him tomorrow
when we call his office.
 No, no, no, no.
 Don't you dare go to his office.
 I'll talk to you myself.
 In the park, at the corner
of Guinevere and Merlin
 by the mall.
 I'll be the one carrying the red purse.
 Red purse.
 When?
 Noon-thirty tomorrow.
 What a mess you've made
of our lives, Dougie.
 Now, what am I gonna do with you?
 I was gonna take you
to see Dr. Ben tomorrow
 during your lunch hour.
 And now I have to meet
your friends at 12:30.
 I... w-where's your
car? And your wallet?
 What happened to your wallet
and your identification?
 And if that's work, you
better get started right away.
 The last thing we need is
you losing your job, Dougie.
 Okay, now,
 I'm gonna go upstairs and
say good night to Sonny Jim.
 Tomorrow's a big day.
 Big day.
 - Oh, Dougie...
- Big day.
 Yes, sweetheart.

 You have a super night too, Gordon.
 I don't know when I'm gonna get home.
 Thank you, Albert.
 And let me remind you
 that this work you are doing tonight
 is very, very important.
 And I will be thinking
of you as I drink this...
 Here you go.
 Thank you, sweetheart.
 Fine Bordeaux.
 Yes, I love a night on the town
 when it's 34 degrees and raining.
 Fuck Gene Kelly, you motherfucker!
 Diane.
 Hello, Albert.
 Ah, shit.
 Ah.
 Whoa.
 That is... whoo!
 That's right, small time.
 You can, uh,
 you can pick the rest
of it up at Mary Ann's.
 How'd you know that name?
 You know the area?
 Mm...
 Shit.
 Oh, tha... this stuff kicks.
 Have you ever studied your hand?
 What do you think?
 I've been all around
here last couple of weeks.
 I, uh...
 I like it.
 We can... We can move the sparkle
 right down from Canada.
 Yeah.
 I got a problem with my liver.
 Hey, these fucking little towns,
 they're a pushover, right?
 Law enforcement's asleep at the wheel.
 Fuckin' sheriff here is like
90 years old or something.
 Did you ever the see the
movie The King and I?
 What?
 I said I like it.
 What do you think?
 You, uh,
 you got this under control?
 Yeah.
 You better have.
 There's... there's one problem.
 I don't know you yet.
 I'm gonna be watching you, kid.
 I'm watching you.
 Got that?
 Yeah.
 I got it.
 Don't call me "kid."
 Just...
 Just remember this,
 kid...
 I will saw your head open
 and eat your brains
 if you fuck me over.
 You can count on that.
 This is you.
 This is me.
 Heads, I win.
 Tails, you lose.
 "Kid."
 Fuck you, man!
 Come on. Come on.
 Come on. Come on.
 Morning, Bill.
 Hey, Carl!
 Yeah?
 Can I get a ride with you into town?
 I-I gotta pick up
Linda's mail at the P.O.
 Sure, Mickey.
 Bill.
 Beautiful morning, huh?
 You, uh,
 you go into town about this
time every day, don't you?
 Damn near.
 How come?
 Gets me out of this trailer park.
 Not much I got to look forward to
 at my age, Mickey,
 except the hammer slamming down.
 Don't say that, Carl.
 You know, you got a lot of tread left.
 How's Linda?
 She's doing a lot better.
 Got the government
agencies to finally get
 one of them electric wheelchairs.
 Fuckin' war.
 So the government's
taking care of you, huh?
 Not hardly.
 Took us about six months to
get this wheelchair for her.
 Fuckin' government. Ha.
 Want a smoke?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, but I quit.
 Quit?
 Yeah.
 Quit about a year ago.
 I've been smoking for 75 years,
 every fucking day.
 So when I pass that shop, I
 say, "Oh, I wonder if they have
a cupcake with my name on it."
 And when I go in, sure
enough, they have it.
 It's magic.
 And when I pass by the Double R, I say,
 "Hm, I wonder if they have
 a slice of cherry pie
with my name on it."
 And when I come in,
sure enough, you have it.
 Today you had two pieces of pie
 with my name on it, each one.
 Well, Miriam, it turns out
 you're one of our best
pie customers ever.
 Because Norma makes the best pies.
 - She sure does.
- Mm-hmm.
 Oh, hey, can I get two
cups of coffee to go?
 One decaf for me and one regular
 for one of the moms who
loves Double R coffee?
 - Coming right up.
- Excellent.
 How is school, Miriam?
 Oh, the kids this year are so cute.
 Aw.
 Okay, here you go.
 Keep the change. The tip is for you all.
 Oh, thank you, Miriam.
 - Thank you, Miriam.
- Bye.
 She can't afford to
leave a tip like that.
 I know. Poor thing.
 But she just loves our pies.
 You know what? Next
time, let's treat her.
 Oh, yeah, great. Great idea.
 Stupid magic motherfucker.
 Ha, yeah, "kid"?
 I'll show you fucking kid.
 Whoo!
 Yeah!
 Got ya.
 Whoo!
 What the fuck?
 Fuck this.
 Hey!
 No!
 No!
 Oh, no.
 No.
 Oh, God.
 Hey! Hey, I told you
 to get out of the fucking way!
 No.
 God.
 Greg!
 I found the plate.
 One-one-nine!
 One-one-nine!
 David, union, George, Edward,
 Lincoln, victor.
 Copy?
 Got it.
 Dougie?
 Dougie.
 Dougie.
 Quit clowning around.
 Dougie...
 Dougie.
 Dougie.
 Come on.
 Jones!
 Jones!
 Jones!
 Dougie!
 In my office!
 Now!
 Huh.
 What the hell
 are all these childish scribbles?
 H-how am I gonna make
any sense out of this?
 Make...
 sense of it.
 I'm thinking you may need
 some good professional help, Dougie.
 Help Dougie.
 Dougie.
 Thank you.
 I want you to keep this
information to yourself.
 This is disturbing.
 To say the least.
 I'll take it from here.
 But I may need your help again.
 You've certainly given
me a lot to think about.
 Think about.
 Dougie?
 You're an... An interesting fellow.
 You Jones?
 Yes. Now let's get to it.
 Explain to me exactly what Dougie did
 to make him owe you money.
 He borrowed it.
 What do you mean, "he borrowed it"?
 He took points on a football game.
 He got greedy, he doubled down.
 It didn't work out for him.
 Out 20 grand he was, plus interest.
 Now, that was three weeks ago.
 Meter's still running.
 It's up to 52.
 So let me get this straight.
People were playing games.
 He made a bet where he lost $20,000.
 But you want him to
pay you back $52,000?
 Very good. That's correct.
 Okay, so you get this straight.
 My husband has a job, he has a wife,
 he has a child, he does
not make enough money
 to pay back $52,000 for anything.
 We are not wealthy people.
 We drive cheap, terrible cars.
 We are the 99 percenters.
 And we are shit on enough.
 And we are certainly
not gonna be shit on
 by the likes of you.
 Nevertheless, lady...
 So here's what we're gonna do.
 Without my knowledge,
my husband came to you
 for a loan of $20,000.
 You were nice enough to give it to him.
 But he should never have
been gambling like that.
 I'm gonna pay you back.
 Now, at my bank, where we make
 less than one percent interest
 on what little money we have,
 people would be turning cartwheels
 just to get 25 percent
interest on any loan,
 and that is what I'm generously
 gonna give to you right now,
 $25,000.
 That is my first, last,
 and only offer to you.
 What kind of world are we living in
 where people can behave like this?
 Treat other people this way
without any compassion
 or feeling for their suffering?
 We are living in a dark, dark age,
 and you
 are part of the problem.
 Now, I suggest you take a
good, long look at yourselves
 because I never want to
see either of you again.
 Tough dame.
 Tough.
 What do you mean he wasn't
in the car? Three bodies?
 Oh, no.
 Fuck!
 The hell?
 Use the ladies' room, Chad.
 The hell are you doing?
 Please, Chad,
 use another restroom.
 Clear this with the sheriff?
 I'll tell him if you don't.
 Yeah, you do that, Chad.
 Filling out paperwork's no fun, fellows.
 I know that, but, uh, gotta be done.
 And when you finish...
 That motherfucking piece of shit.
 I want you to handle that...
 Well, surprise, surprise!
 It's not fixed!
 What's that, Doris?
 Dad's car.
 This morning he went to drive,
 couldn't even get it out
of the driveway, Frank!
 It just lurched and lurched.
 Sounds like he left
the emergency brake on.
 Are you telling me my father
doesn't know how to drive a car?
 Is that what you're telling me?
 Don't you dare,
 don't you dare try to blame my father
 for that car not running right!
 We'll get it looked at again
 if it'll make you feel better.
 Feel better? Feel better?
 Why, why are you always
against me, Frank?
 Let's go to my office.
 They did a lousy job fixing that car.
 They have to make it right,
 or we're not paying them until they do!
 I sure wouldn't take
that kind of shit off her.
 What?
 You don't know what
you're talking about.
 Oh, yeah? How's that?
 Forget it.
 What's the matter?
 It's a free world.
 I can voice my opinion.
 Oh, you sure can.
 Oh, brother.
 She didn't use to be like this.
 You didn't know that their
son committed suicide?
 Yeah, I heard something about that.
 He couldn't take being a soldier.
 Sheriff's Department.
What's your emergency?
 Where's your location?
 What's your telephone number?
