 Previously, on Reckless... Arliss! This is all my fault... I never should have filed the lawsuit. We have a case. And they know it. If it were me, I'd fight. Jamie might find out about this. She might see this. You can't tell her about your undercover status. You can't tell anyone. Have you ever trusted anyone? I trust you. Jamie.

 How are you? The big man wants his guns. We got some heat coming down on us, so shop's closed until it passes. Hey! Somebody! Hey! Jamie. - Jamie. - What? Aren't you supposed to be in Columbia at that legal seminar? Oh, no. Jamie. Roy. I didn't know you were... Me, neither.

 I mean, we could have driven up together. Actually, I have a job later. As what, a lumberjack? Ha-ha. Two coffees? One is for... Dec. Jamie Sawyer. Don't you look... comfortable. My alarm didn't go off. Roy, I just got called back to Charleston to meet with a potentially big donor. His support could make or break Holland's run for mayor, and all he's got is one hour at lunchtime. I can send a car back up for you. No, it's okay. I can hitch a ride with Jamie. Well, all right, then. Miss Sawyer. I have a client incarcerated at broad river penitentiary. I planned on stopping there on my way home. I don't mind. I brought some work to do. You'll give me a ride. Can't let you walk home, can I? Hi, Max. Well, Jamie, look at you; You dressed up for me. Is that what you're gonna wear to my hearing? No. And you're not gonna wear that, either. I worked it out with the bailiff to give you a suit... Who's that? Your boyfriend? No. He's just a lawyer. I was giving him a ride home. I hope you have a better poker face in the courtroom. Will Gloria's family be there? Excuse me. Who is she talking to? Max Carlyle. Serving 20 to life for murder. Killed his girlfriend about six years ago now. She's the only visitor he ever gets. She's been coming once a month like clockwork, more than two years. Two years? You sure? Most lawyers don't look like that. Thank you. You're welcome. So... Are you seeing that reporter, Nancy Davis? I don't know. It's... Casual. She's pretty. You know, you've been working on that Max Carlyle case a long time... since before you moved here. Gloria, Max's girlfriend, was killed with a hunting knife he owned. They lived in a dicey area and he kept it for protection, so of course his fingerprints were all over it. He also didn't have an alibi. But we've been able to determine that the police found another print on the knife, a partial, that they never identified. Max's counsel never cited it. So you're arguing that he was given an inadequate defense? There also may have been misconduct by the original prosecutor, Emmett Hayes. Now, wait, this is Emmett's case? I worked with him at the solicitor's office before he was elected Attorney General. Maybe you could help me. You could look over the case files... You might notice something I've missed. I don't know, Jamie. I mean... Emmett's like a mentor to me. Sure. Don't worry. I'll do fine. What? Nothing. How'd it go? Fine. Roy was there. Is that good or bad? How was Max? Well, all things considered, not bad. Well, I got something that's gonna cheer you up. What is it? I know we've looked and looked into the police files of Max Carlyle, but we've never looked into the lab file. So today I moseyed on down there with my trusty little court order... And look what I found. The CPD did order a fingerprint analysis of that partial on Max's knife. But this is just the request... Where's the report of findings? That's the thing. Either they never ran the test... Or somebody didn't like the results. I have to talk to Pat McCandless. Not him again... You already talked to him twice. He was the lead detective on Gloria's murder. He's also Terry's father. You're not exactly lawyer of the year in that house. Oh, don't-don't worry, Detective Cruz. That grogginess is natural. It's just the sedative wearing off. I-I assure you, you'll be tip-top in no tiempo. I know you. Well, everybody thinks they "know" you 'cause they see you on TV. Russ Waterman. Waterman Watersports, yeah. "If you want fun in the sun, just add Waterman!" Why am I here? The reason you're here, detective, is because, in addition to my... day job... I also run a... a very lucrative side business. Guns. Mm-hmm. Terry McCandless has been very helpful. But you see, there's a slight wrinkle. I gave him 15 grand as a down payment on a batch of untraceable polymer handguns, and yet it seems he's backed out of his end of the bargain. Come on. Come on. Ok, pull him a chair. Let him sit down right here. Come on. Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm. Preston. Easy... Terence! What the hell, man? I want my guns! I promised them to a very... volatile gentleman. He expects to take delivery in 72 hours. If he's not happy... Well, then I'm not happy. And if I'm not happy, then... Synced by emmasan www.addic7ed.com You can't just leave us here! Oh, great, no signal. Guess we're walking. What the hell did you get me into, man? Waterman just picks us up like it's nothing? We're cops... we could take his ass down. You don't cross Waterman. Guy sells weapons to everybody. He decides he wants you dead, ain't nowhere in the world you can hide. Yeah, great. So, what now? Now? We get the guns. Where are they? Still in a duffle bag back at the evidence locker at the station. When I was messing around with Lee Anne, it was easy for me to get access. But ever since she got fired, Knox changed his security protocol, brought in a new evidence sergeant. Your good buddy, Oglethorpe. So that's why you let me in, to get to Oglethorpe? I let you in because I need to get to the guns. The fact that you're tight with Oglethorpe makes what we're about to do a lot easier. Yeah? And what are we about to do? We're gonna rob the evidence locker. What you doing out of your room? I need to get out of here. Why don't you talk to them? Because they won't listen to me. I've been telling them that I would like to go home! Here. You start acting crazy, that doesn't help anybody. Somebody blew up our house, and I'm gonna find them. - Lee Anne... - Listen... I can't get them to discharge you if you keep coughing, screaming, and... refusing to take your meds. I get it... You're stressed. I'm stressed, too. But I keep it in. We need to find somewhere to live. We need to find a way out of this mess. Yeah. Where's your ring? I carry too many plates and drinks at the restaurant. Didn't want anything to happen to it. All right. So, that covers Lee Anne's job performance, her peer reviews. That just leaves the issue of her statement of complaint. What did you think of the old deputy chief? - Oh. Tarkington? - Yeah. Old Tark left me hip-deep in unfiled paperwork. We haven't been able to find any statement of complaint by Lee Anne. All right, well, keep looking, okay? 'Cause we have to be sure. If Lee Anne filed a grievance, then Jamie's case is strong, especially on the sexual harassment charge. But if she didn't, then... that charge will likely get tossed. Maybe even the whole lawsuit. Betsy? Have you been able to get a hold of deputy chief Tarkington yet? Nope, but I called my friend Cindy who knows Tark's brother, Boyd. According to him, Tark's on his boat in Nags Head. How long did you work for him? Three long years. Come here. Was there ever a problem with documents disappearing from this office? Please, Betsy. It'd be helpful for me to know the truth. All the time. Anything good in there? This old murder is back in the news. Troubled teenage girl killed by even more troubled teenage boy. - Max Carlyle. - Yeah. How'd you know? Jamie. It's her case. She told you. So... do you think he has a chance, Nancy? I feel bad for him. He had a pretty rough life. A drug-addicted mom, arrested at least six times as a minor, in and out of foster care in Chicago. He's from Chicago? Yeah. I figured that's how Jamie knew him. Emmett. So, I wish this was just a social call, but I wanted to ask you about Max Carlyle. I know you're in town for his PCR hearing. Why are you so interested in Carlyle? Jamie Sawyer is a friend of mine. You need some new friends. She's pretty smart, Emmett. Yeah. She's also brash and graceless. Which is not a surprise, considering how she was raised. What are you talking about? Her mother was an addict who chose drugs over her. She spent her formative years bouncing around in foster care. Shall I go on? You do this kind of background on all your opposing counsel, Emmett? The courtroom's a battlefield, Roy. You got to know your enemy. Mr. McCandless. Jamie Sawyer... Lady lawyer. I have a couple more questions on the Carlyle case. You know, you've been making a lot of trouble lately for my son, haven't you? I'd appreciate it if you'd just get off my property. When you were lead detective on Max's case, you sent the partial print out for a comparison. I found the order. Did you have another suspect? Another print to compare it to? What was the result of the comparison? You know... I just can't recall. Well, maybe you'll be able to recall if I subpoena you. Ooh. Subpoena me. I promise you, won't remember my own name. Wine? I talked to Emmett. On the off chance that there was some sort of misconduct, he will fight even harder to prove that Max did the crime. Just so he doesn't have to face his own demons. That's what I was afraid of. Jamie, do you have some connection with Max? Something deeper than attorney and client? What do you mean? Your backgrounds are similar. Did you know him from before? When you were in... foster care? Max is my brother. My mother was a very pretty, very charming... heroin addict. I was three the first time they took me away from her. It's one of my first memories, crying for her as they carried me away. Jamie... One day, I was about six, and my mother had sobered up again. She had this new baby. Max. I adored him. I loved the way he smelled, and his little hands touching my face. But she married his father, and he was... The worst. This time, it was me who called child services. Since Max was an infant, we weren't placed in the same home. Sometimes, I wouldn't see him for months. And then I got this... scholarship at a boarding school. You lost him. I never stopped looking for him. Two years ago, I finally found him at Broad River. I was about to take a job at a big firm in New York, but... I moved to Charleston instead. To be near him. To work to get him freed. So... does he know that he's your brother? I keep thinking I'll tell him after I get him released. Jamie... Let me come to the hearing. Let me... sit at your table. Roy... No. Look, I need to see what Emmett's presenting. I need to hear it. That is the only way I can help you. Don't say no. Okay? I... You need someone at your table. All right? It's the water, man. Well, come no further. I'm Russ Waterman, and I've got the widest variety of water sports rentals in the low country. If you want fun in the sun, just add Waterman. Betsy? Hey, Lee Anne. It's so good to see you. How are you and arliss holding up? What you've been going through. Bless that sweet heart of yours, Betsy. Your lawyer's caused quite a stink at the precinct. I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but... Deputy chief tarkington never filed your statement of complaint. That's why there's no record of it. He destroyed it. This could be... everything to my case, Betsy. And believe me... It's my only chance to get my life back. Would you testify for us? I don't want to do that. I don't want to testify against the department. Well, why...? I make copies of everything that passes through my inbox. It's my little insurance policy, so I get every penny of my pension. I could just slip you a copy. Betsy, I could kiss you. Oh, honey, I'm not doing this out of the goodness of my heart. I want to retire soon. And my nest egg isn't what it used to be. If you want the complaint, it's going to cost you. $5,000. __ Defense calls David Ince. Mr. Ince, did you represent Max Carlyle when he was convicted of murdering Gloria Walsh? I did. These volumes contain the evidence brought forward by then Solicitor Hayes in State vs. Max Carlyle. This contains yours. Prosecution submitted 22 exhibits. You submitted exactly one. You were supposed to provide a vigorous defense. Yeah, well, how am I supposed to do that after he tells me he killed their daughter? - That's a lie. I never said that. - Objection. Attorney-client privilege. Order. The defendant will refrain from speaking or be removed. Mr. Ince's comments will be stricken from the record. Tomorrow you're going to be on the stand. The Attorney General will want a repeat of today's performance. Don't give it to him. Did you see Gloria's family? You're an animal. You murdered my stepdaughter! You should be in a cage the rest of your life. - Max, no! - Mr. Walsh, you need to step back. You're the animal, you know that? - Sir! - Gloria hated you. Take him back to the courtroom until the transport van arrives. You murdered Gloria! You want me to talk to him? No, I need to do it. - Max. - I'm screwed. It doesn't matter what I wear. They think I did this and I didn't. We're not done with our case. - Don't give up hope now. - Hope? Really, Jamie? Hope? What's hope ever gotten me? Hmm? My own mother and father dumped me like I was nothing. Gloria was the only person who ever loved me. My life ended when I saw her body lying there. Your life isn't over. I got nothing. No one. Max, you have someone. You do. There's... something I have to tell you. Something I should've said a long time ago. Do you remember your sister? Karen? Karen, yeah. What, you gonna say you know her? I do. Know her. So do you. Wait, what? I looked for you. I never stopped looking for you. You're not her. I am. Then what did you give me the day you left? If you're Karen, you'll remember. A rock. A bloodstone. And I kept one for myself. You sat and talked with me for two years and you never said a damn thing. The van's here. I'll follow you back to the prison. Yeah, maybe you won't. Maybe you'll disappear for another 20 years. Here. I'm late. You idiot. That's not even a week's worth. Go to hell. That's all they had. Why didn't you go to another pharmacy? Because I'm late. I got you your pills. I'll get you more later. Jamie Sawyer came by yesterday. Here? What the hell for? Poking around on an old case I ran. I don't like her. Guess that's one thing we can agree on. Figures she's repping your ex-girlfriend, Lee Anne, huh? - Yeah. - You know, some women, you cross 'em, uh, they throw your clothes in the street, maybe smash up your car. But you... You bang the one nut job that's got to sue the entire police department. Been the same since you were yea high. The worse it is for you, the more you want it. Weren't you the one that chased mom to the airport with five clips and your service weapon? Now, you listen to me, boy. You listen good. You walk soft. You cannot lose that job. Don't worry. I'm gonna retire fat and happy. The only way I'd lose my pension is by spending it. That wasn't my fault, and you know it. They stole my pension. 30 years I gave to that department, - and I got screwed. - So did I. Right about the moment you came crawling to me, playing the "dear old dad" card, begging to move in here. And I told you I'd take care of you, and I'm gonna, all right? Just don't expect me to smile through it all. Morning. Hi. Are you all right? You were up all night. Uh, yeah, just burning the candle at both ends. What's all this? I just wanted to thank you for letting me stay while Arliss is in the hospital. And I've got some good news. The statement of complaint. Where did you get this? I remembered I had some files in a storage locker. Lucky for us, it was there. Hey! Need to go. Hey, Preston. Watch the game last night? Ah! Nah, I missed it. Yeah, I got, uh... a bit tied up. Madison square garden. Makes me miss the city. I know what you mean. All right. I, uh, I need the fiber evidence from 6502. I'll bring it out. You know what? You mind if I give you a hand? Because it's pretty delicate stuff. Sure. Yeah. Right. So what was the score? 102 to 75. A blowout. Love it. Yo, Oglethorpe! Hey, Oglethorpe, you caged beast, open the door! Wait your turn! Can't wait. I'm in a rush. Open the door, man! Go ahead. I got it. Come on! Oglethorpe... I'm coming! Hey. Hey. Talk to your wife. Larry heard you in the bullpen. I didn't say anything, I swear. You're a damn liar. Can I help you? Hey, Oglethorpe, I was here first. Okay, all right, fine. Hypothetically, if I did talk about your wife, I probably mentioned something about her legs being like melted butter. Hot. Easy to spread. Can I help you? What kind of operation you running here, man? I'm tired with this. All right, guys. Guys, would you please just take this upstairs? Guys, can you just please... Hey! What's wrong with you? - You okay? - Yeah. Thanks. Apologize. Sorry. Sorry. What do you want? Thanks, Og. Everything you got on 4139. What happened to McCandless? Deputy chief Knox, are you aware that I have made multiple unanswered requests to your office for a statement of complaint submitted by Lee Anne Marcus to your predecessor, deputy chief Tarkington? Yes, I'm aware of the requests. Did Lee Anne Marcus ever submit a statement of complaint to deputy chief Tarkington? Not that I'm aware of. So you're saying that there was never a statement of complaint submitted by Lee Anne Marcus alleging sexual harassment in the workplace? As far as I know, she never submitted a complaint. Well, I am surprised you weren't tougher on him. I was tougher than you think. What is that supposed to mean? I just want you to know that even though you've been a good friend to me, with Max and everything, I have to do my job, to the best of my ability, for Lee Anne. You know, it's getting hard to keep switching hats with you. Well, maybe one day we'll go hatless. Let our hair down. See how it feels. So, how is Max? I told him the truth. How'd he take it? Not well. I thought that if he knew that I was his sister, then... He wouldn't feel so alone, but... He's so angry. Well, this ought to help: I looked into Randy Walsh, the stepdad, to see if he had a criminal record. I did that. There's nothing. Well, there's nothing on Randy Walsh. But I did find something on Timothy Walsh. Gloria's stepbrother. This is a sealed juvenile arrest record. How did you get this? I know some people who know some people. It turns out I'm not the first person to look into Timothy's sealed file. It was requested three weeks after Gloria was murdered. In order to compare his fingerprints against a partial found in an ongoing murder investigation. Want to take one guess at who made that request? Pat McCandless. Bingo. I guess we'll be seeing Pat on the stand after all. Max... could you tell the court about the day that Gloria was killed? We fought that morning. I don't remember about what. Gloria had started using again, and she was impossible to talk to when she was coming down, and I couldn't take it, so I left. But I loved her. When you love someone, you don't just leave them. So what happened next? I got back to the apartment. Door was open, she was lying on the floor, bleeding. I called 911. You were found covered in Gloria's blood. How did that happen? I was holding her when the paramedics got there. She was still alive, you know? Did Gloria say anything to you? She just asked me not to go. Thank you. Nothing further, Your Honor. So... It's your testimony that you don't remember what you fought about that morning, is that correct? Yes. Isn't it true you fought because Gloria was leaving you? Yeah, Gloria was gonna move back home to be with her family, where she'd be taken care of, where she'd get the help she needed. Objection, Attorney General is testifying. She was leaving you, and the only way you could stop her was with a knife. She was probably gonna walk out on me, yeah. No more questions, Your Honor. Mr. McCandless, you were the investigator on the Max Carlyle murder case. Is that correct? I was. I'm showing you defense exhibit four, a previously sealed juvenile arrest record for Timothy Walsh, the victim's stepbrother. Now, during your investigation, you requested Timothy's file. Why? I had witnesses tell me he was hanging around, bothering his sister. They fought. And can you tell me why Timothy was arrested? He assaulted Gloria's high school boyfriend. Your Honor, I'd like to submit into evidence defense exhibit five, a record from the fingerprint expert at CPD confirming the match of the fingerprint of Timothy Walsh with the partial fingerprint found on the murder weapon. Objection! Partial matches are not acceptable evidence. I'll withdraw. Did you send this report with the matching fingerprints to the solicitor Emmett Hayes? You are under oath. I did. Timothy Walsh was a troubled young man with a dangerous attraction to his stepsister. Did Timothy's obsession ultimately lead to murder? That is not our burden of proof here today. What we must prove is that Max Carlyle was not given a fair trial. He was not adequately represented by his court-appointed attorney, and his case was irrevocably damaged by a blatant act of prosecutorial misconduct... Withholding exculpatory evidence of the partial fingerprint match. Max Carlyle has been abandoned throughout his life. By his parents. By his... sister. Please, don't let justice abandon him as well. Terence. Right on time. I really do feel like my tax dollars are at work. Two dozen untraceable pistols. Where's my money? Be patient. Look at these guns. Well... Terry? My bad. Mm-hmm. Just a key. I want my money! All right. It seems we got ourselves a situation. All right, and it's my fault. I-I really, I really think it is. It's the company I keep. I want my other $15k. And then I'm walking out of here. Why would you assume that I would double-cross you? Go! It's taken me years to find, uh, officers as, uh, amenable as you. As far as I'm concerned, well... You've earned your bones. So, what, you're saying everything we just did is all some kind of... Some kind of playground test? Ah, don't be so sore, Terry. You passed. Now, I got a big shipment coming in, so... I'll be in touch. Grab that. Well, you know your way out. The judge has reached a decision. The judge has reached a decision. Roy? No matter what the verdict is, I want to say this now. Thank you. All rise. Mr. Carlyle, you have been found guilty by a jury of your peers. To overturn that conviction, the evidence must be unassailable. In this case, I feel that that standard has been met. Therefore I am not only just approving your post-conviction relief petition, but due to the egregious misconduct that occurred, I am ordering your immediate release, sir. Good luck to you, sir. Court adjourned. You thirsty? Or hungry? There's a great deli around the corner. It's still open. You okay? I don't know what to do with myself. Well, you can stay here as long as you need to figure it out. Karen. Why'd you change your name? Because I wanted to be somebody new. I do, too. Give me your hand. You saved my life today, you know that. I want to hear all your stories. I want to know everything, everywhere you've been. I'm gonna run to the deli. We can talk over sandwiches. I won't be long. Sorry I took so long. That deli was closed. I had to go to Harris Teeter. Max? Max? Max! Max! __ Synced by emmasan www.addic7ed.com
