 Previously on reckless:
Ms. Marcus is suing
 The city of charleston
 For sexual harassment...
 Okay, jamie, game on.
 They have a tape.
 It's footage of you
 And three other men
 Having sex on a police car.
 We had something.
Yeah, we did...
 Until you decided
to share me with
your buddies.
 (groans, gasps)
 Next time you touch my wife,
I'll kill you.
 There's no sex ring.
 This was an affair
between two officers
 That got way out
of hand.
 You want to be my boyfriend?
 Roy:
Missing footage.
I'm not in it.
 You may want to rethink
that answer.
 Preston was there.
I'm telling you the truth.
 Without proof.
Ask him.
 Ask preston yourself.
 Literally, every day,
get home from school,
 Throw my books down and run out
to play stickball
 Until it was so dark
you could just barely see
 Yeah. Only knew it was time
to come in for dinner
 When the smell of my mom's
fresh-baked bread
 Would make it out
to the street.
 That woman was
all about the bread.
 It's crazy how much
you two are alike.
 What's the matter?
 Why are you so quiet?
 Me?
Yeah.
 I'm not.
 Okay, that would not hold up
 Under cross-examination,
counselor.
 What's up?
 I was listening,
 I promise.
 It's just... (sighs)
 I do...
 Have something
that I need to ask you.
 (phone rings)
 I'm sorry. It's work, all right?
One second.
 This is detective cruz.
 Yeah.
 All right, I'll be there.
 (sighs)
got a homicide on johns island.
 I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to drop you off.
 I'm all the way on the other
side of town.
 I'll just go with you.
 No, no, I wouldn't do that
to you.
 I'll take you.
 No, it's okay.
 I'll stay outside.
 (chuckling):
All right.
 ♪ hold on
 ♪ hold on to me...
 (siren wails briefly)
 Just hang here.
 I'll be right back.
Let me find out what's up.
 All right?
 Man:
They're waiting
for you over there!
 I left it inside.
Be right back.
 All right, let's notify general.
Our victim is deceased.
 I'd say
about 20 minutes.
 Nobody else upstairs,
all right?
Yes, detective.
 (indistinct radio transmission)
 Curtis, give james a hand
upstairs, all right? Thanks.
 Mr. And mrs. Hope?
 Detective cruz,
charleston homicide.
 Tell me what happened here
tonight?
 We were upstairs
asleep in bed.
 I-I heard a noise.
 (door opens)
 I grabbed my gun.
I-I came down.
 Someone had broken into
the house, and I...
 Is your firearm licensed?
 Yes.
 Had you ever seen
the victim prior
to this evening?
 No, never.
Preston:
And this is weird,
 I know, in the heat
of the moment,
 But did you think
about contacting the police
 Before confronting him yourself?
 No.
 (two gunshots)
I didn't.
 Did he attack you?
 You're not obligated to answer
this officer's questions, sir.
 Not without an attorney present.
 Wait-- do...
Do I need an attorney?
 Well, I am one,
and it seems
 You're just defending your
home against an intruder.
 No one in his right mind
would arrest you for that.
 Thank you,
 Miss...
Jamie sawyer.
 Excuse us. Thank you.
 What do you think you're doing?
 You were asking him
leading questions.
 No, I was doing my job, okay?
 Then you go and undermine me
 In front of
everyone in there?
 That was not my intention.
 What was your
intention, jamie?
 To come to my crime scene
and troll for clients?
 (scoffs)
 I thought you were better
than that.
 Well, I guess there's
a lot of things
 We don't know
about each other.
 I'll find my own ride.
 Woman: I'm serious. Dinner was
supposed to be on me.
 Nancy, no self-respecting
gentleman is going
 To let you
pick up the check.
 Even though I made you suffer
through a two-hour interview?
 And it was torture.
 I mean, pure,
outright torture.
 What's torture is
trying to get any
information out of you.
 How am I supposed
to do this profile piece?
 The station's
dying for it.
 Me on tv?
 Can't see why.
 You're charleston's new
city attorney, and a partner
 At one of the city's
most elite law firms,
 And you can't see why?
 (chuckles)
are you for real?
 I am just a local boy
 Defending the city
I love in court.
 End of story.
 I'm not out for
personal publicity.
 Then you're just a tease.
 Otherwise, why meet
me for dinner?
 Because I watch you
on the news.
 And possibfind you
interesting.
 Oh...
 In that case, think I can
use my feminine wiles
 To get at least one little
morsel out of you
 Regarding the lee anne
marcus case?
 Way to bury your lead.
 It's your first big case
 As city attorney.
 And I've heard whispers
of a possible sex scandal
 Within the ranks
of the charleston pd.
 Don't believe everything
you hear.
 I believe you.
 So... Here's my boat.
 You want to go for a ride?
 Love to, but I, um,
 Better get back to the station.
 Right. Well, if anything
comes up worth reporting,
 You'll be the first one
that I call.
 I hope you don't wait
that long to call me.

 Morning.
 Morning. I checked
the voice mail.
 Roy left two more messages.
 He called my cell, too.
He can wait.
 I'll see him in court.
You leaving already?
 Scheduling on lee anne's
case don't start till 10:00.
 Gotta grab a bite on my way.
 You pushing for an early
settlement conference?
 I'm trying to delay it
as much as possible.
 I don't want
roy thinking we're trying
 To get a quick payout
from the city.
 (phone rings)
 Sawyer and associates.
 Just a second, sir.
 You better take this.
 This is jamie.
 Ms. Sawyer, this is gavin hope.
 You were at my home last night?
 Mr. Hope, yes, what is it?
 I'm at the police station.
They're placing me under arrest.
 I need your help.
 Deputy chief knox.
 You got a minute?
 In this department at all,
let alone my office.
 I want to know why you arrested
my client, gavin hope.
 And you think
 I have any interest
in helping you?
 I was there last night.
I know what happened.
 He was just defending his home
against an intruder.
 Anybody around here
ever heard of the
 Protection of persons
and property act?
 A yankee trying to throw
"stand your ground" in my face?
 When in rome.
You're seeing only
 What you choose to see.
 Your client's story's
chock-full of holes.
 We didn't find any evidence
of breaking and entering.
 He said the intruder
was armed; no gun was found.
 He shot the victim
four times in the back.
 So that means the victim
was running away from him,
 Not attacking him.
 That adds up to one thing:
Manslaughter.
 (gasps) terry?
 What the hell?
You don't return
my calls, lee anne.
 You don't leave me
much of a choice.
 I told you, you and me,
we've got nothing to say.
 I know, I know, it's the
lawsuit. Blah, blah, blah.
 You need to go... Now.
 He left.
Don't worry.
 Drove off like a bat
out of hell, too.
 Trouble in paradise?
 It's none of your business.
 Your boy arliss paid me
a visit the other night.
 Yeah?
 Yup. I gotta say,
he's got some fight left in him.
 Impressive.
 I know you told him about us.
 And for your
information,
we're good.
 Better than we've been
in a long time, in fact.
 Still don't hold a candle
to what we had.
 This is my life, terry.
 Why'd you come here?
 I came here
to let you know
 That I gave arliss a free pass.
 I was messing around
with his wife.
 After all, you can't blame a man
for boiling over.
 But you best muzzle
your watchdog,
 Lee anne, 'cause next time,
I ain't gonna be so generous.
 (indistinct chatter)
 There you are.
 I was
getting worried.
 I appreciate the concern.
 I have been trying to call you.
 And I've been trying
to avoid you.
 Look, I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.
 I could've told you
about preston a lot sooner.
 You talk to him?
 No.
So you still
 Don't believe me
that he was on the tape.
 To be honest, roy,
 I don't know what to believe.
 A scheduling order
has been requested
 Regarding the case
of lee anne marcus
 V. The city of charleston.
 Charges of sexual harassment,
wrongful termination
 And defamation of character.
 Now, before I set a date certain
on this thing,
 Do you have a trial
length estimate?
 Two days, your honor.
Two months,
your honor.
 Jamie and roy:
Are you kidding me?
 I assume you two
have discussed settlement.
 I have presented several dates
and times to ms. Sawyer,
 And she has rejected them all.
 Because, conveniently, he only
wants to meet at his office.
 Roy:
And what is wrong
with my office?
 It could be bugged,
for all I know.
Children!
 All right, listen up.
 I'm not a young man.
 And the minutes I have left here
on god's green earth
 Grow more precious to me
 By the day.
 You've just robbed me
of three of 'em.
 Don't even think about
bothering this court again
 Until you've
discussed settlement.
 Do I make myself clear?
 Roy just told judge garner
he only needed two days
 To try lee anne's case.
 That means he has something.
 Vi:
Already?
 Discovery's
barely even begun.
 We have to talk settlement,
and I need some ammo.
 Where are we at
with charlene wilcox?
 That cop
that lee anne mentioned?
 Lee anne said charlene
was being harassed, too,
 And may be willing
to speak out.
 She's coming in
next week.
 That's too late.
 We need her now.
 Meet with her asap.
Get her story.
 See if she'll be willing
to cooperate.
 That could be a huge win for us.
 (siren wailing)
jamie:
Gavin, you were arrested
 Because the police felt
there were some inconsistencies
 With your story.
Now, I can fight this,
 But I need you
to be completely honest with me.
 They're saying that you shot
the intruder four times,
 In the back, and that
he wasn't armed.
 I-I could've sworn
he had a gun.
 So now you're not sure?
 (sighs)
it was so dark.
 And when I saw that man standing
in my living room...
 I-I didn't even think.
 I just kept pulling the trigger
until he fell.
 I-I was just...
 I was just so scared.
 Fine.
 That's all I need.
 Wait, what do you mean?
In the eyes
of the court,
 As long as you were
defending yourself
 Against an intruder,
 The homicide
can be considered justifiable.
 So what's the next step?
 An immunity hearing.
 I'm going to present your case
in front of a judge
 Who can dismiss the charges
outright.
 (siren wailing in distance)
 Knox:
Preston.
 Chief wants an update
on the gavin hope case.
 I looked into our victim
a little more.
 Couple of things jumped out
at me about walt yeager.
 Like what?
Single guy,
 Holds down
a six-figure-a-year job.
 He owns a home south of broad.
 So why would a man like that
break into a home
 To presumably rob it?
 Exactly.
 Let's run this key card.
 Hotel?
Mm-hmm.
 Willow tree inn,
right here in town.
 Man owns a home nearby
but still rents a room?

 Jamie:
Judge sturgess,
 I requested this immunity
hearing on behalf of my client,
 Gavin hope, whom you see
in front of you today.
 He was arrested
because he shot
 An intruder
who broke into his home.
 As my opposing counsel
will most likely point out,
 The victim
was not armed.
 She'll also assert that
my client was not acting out
 Of self-defense and request
that the manslaughter charges
 Against him stand.
 And what do you say
about all that?
 In the eyes of south carolina
law, your honor,
 He had no duty to retreat.
 And it is my hope
that you will choose
 To recognize the protection of
persons and property act here
 In your courtroom today
 And grant him immunity
from prosecution.
 Ms. Bishop, how do you respond?
 Although I do appreciate
ms. Sawyer attempting
 To speak for me,
 I would still like to argue
that the protection of persons
 And property act does not apply
in this case.
 Why is that?
Detective cruz?
 You know, you mind if I approach
the bench, your honor?
 Bring it on.
 Preston:
Through the course
of my investigation,
 I discovered some
photographs that prove
 The alleged intruder,
 Walt yeager, was,
in fact, having a sexual affair
 With mr. Hope's
wife, mindy.
 Hey.
 Hey!
 How could you
blindside me like that?
 Doesn't feel so
good, does it?
 Oh, is that what
this is about? Payback?
 Of course not, jamie.
 I'm just doing my job.
 Your client's wife
was having an affair
 With the man
that he killed.
 And you chose not
to share that with me?
 I'm not obligated to.
Look,
 I knew when we first started
dating that at some point,
 Because of our jobs,
the lines would blur.
 Well, they finally did,
and... Maybe I don't like
 How easy it was for you
to hide things from me.
 Makes me wonder
what else you might be hiding.
 What's that supposed
to mean, jamie?
 You have a problem with me,
 With us, tell me.
 I don't want
to play games.
 Fine.
 Jamie:
So you had no idea
 Your wife was sleeping
with walt yeager?
 Not him, not anyone. I...
 I thought we were happy.
 Gavin, we can still fight this.
 If you didn't know
about the affair
 And walt was in your home,
 "stand your ground"
still applies.
 What I want
to know is,
 Why was he there
in the first place?
 I did come home a day early
from a business trip.
 Maybe he came over to see mindy,
thinking I wouldn't be there.
 Or maybe she wanted you
to be there.
 I'm going to find out
what really happened, gavin.
 I promise.
 Did you know
 Walt was coming over
the other night?
 No. No, how could I?
 We met in the same hotel room
a couple of times a week.
 I never even told him
where I lived.
 Then why was he at your house?
 I don't know,
and that's what scares me.
 I-I broke up with him
earlier that day.
 I broke it off. I told him
I couldn't do it anymore,
 And he got real angry.
 Do you think
he wanted to hurt you?
 Or gavin?
 Walt just kept saying
he couldn't let me go.
 But I never thought
he could go that far.
 (bell tinkles)
 Don't stop.
 Keep walking.
Charlene?
 Thank you for meeting me.
 Lee anne is a great girl.
 Makes me sick
what happened to her.
 So how long
have you known her?
 Well, we met in the academy,
 Patrolled together as rookies.
 And you know terry mccandless
pretty well, too?
 Yeah, and all
his buddies.
 They ever harass you?
 Oh, they call it
flirting, but yes.
 Always hitting on me,
 Talking about what they'd love
to do to me.
 Did you report anyone?
No.
 I was too worried
about losing my job.
 But not anymore.
No job's worth keeping
 If you're living in fear
all the time.
 And someone has to stand up
for lee anne.
 So you'd be willing to testify
on her behalf?
 Yes. I will.
 That's music
to my ears, charlene.
 I'll call you
to set a time to go over
 The specifics with my boss,
jamie sawyer, okay?
 So, you, uh, settle
that city attorney case
 That seems to be taking up
all your time?
 Working on it.
 But I have no interest
in rolling over.
 Then you better be certain
you have a case.
 You try it and lose, there may
be some blowback on the firm.
 May lose us some clients.
 So you only care
because it could affect you.
 All politics
 Are local, right?
 (chuckles)
speaking of which,
 As you know, we have
a mayoral election
 Coming up in the not-so-distant
future, and a certain name
 Has come up recently in some
of my various social circles.
 Holland knox.
 Knox?
 For mayor?
It's not
so illogical.
 He's a local boy
who has dedicated his life
 To law enforcement
after a knee injury
 Killed off his shot
at college ball.
 And since he transferred here
from north charleston,
 He's brought
our police force
 Into the 21st century,
and the crime stats show it.
 All right, and what-what exactly
does this have to do with me?
 A few... Subtle overtures
have been made,
 But he won't even
entertain them.
 And you want me to talk to him.
 You're his best friend.
 He has got it good
being deputy chief.
 Now, why would he want
to ruin that?
 Could've said
the same thing to you
 When you were
an assistant solicitor,
 But you got comfortable here
right quick, didn't you?
 (chuckles)
 Think about it.
 I will.
 Pardon me, miss.
 Jamie sawyer, correct?
 Jamie: Mm-hmm.
Aren't you the one
that-that's taking on...
 Roy and the entire
police department?
 (chuckles)
 Dec fortnum.
 Very nice to meet you.
 I do so admire
 Your free spirit,
ms. Sawyer.
 The way you just
fluttered on down
 To charleston and started
shaking all the old trees.
 (both chuckle)
 I sincerely hope
 That our paths
do cross again.
 My ex-father-in-law.
 You didn't tell me
what a charmer he was.
 A real peach.
 Please.
Uh, no.
 I won't be long.
 Regarding a settlement.
 Think it over,
and get back to me.

 Mr. Rayder, we are now

 Now, you all know the facts

 A settlement figure

 By ms. Marcus's counsel.
 I am presenting that figure
 To the city council
for your approval.
 Go ahead.
 $3 million.

mr. Rayder,
 You find that sum
to be exorbitant.
 That I do, ma'am.
 Our city will not
 Be held hostage by this woman

 Ms. Marcus needs a bible,
 Not a lawsuit.
 If this case even gets to trial,
 It could pose a nuisance.
 Besides the obvious financial
 Burden it poses,
the good gentlemen
 Serving us on the police force
would have to endure
 Some very untoward publicity.
 Or... They could be vindicated.
 Now, I know that
I can win this, mrs. Reed.
 We've already conferred
on the matter,
 And we're prepared
to make a counteroffer,
 Not to exceed $500,000.
 You really do want this

 I could have

 So nice of you to say that.
(laughs)
 Well, I, uh...
Got a peace offering.
 I'm gonna go out on a limb.
 Got some new information
on gavin hope.
 Well, I spoke to his wife
after I found out
 She was having an affair
with walt yeager.
 She said she
had broken it off,
 Insinuating that he may
have come over that night
 To hurt her or gavin.
She told me
the same thing.
 Well, I dug a little deeper,
and it turns out that,
 Uh, security camera footage
from the hotel
 Where they would meet up
showed them leaving the lobby
 Holding hands, all smiles
on the day of the murder.
 Not exactly
a break-up scene.
 So mindy was lying.
 And I found out that last
week she started having
divorce papers drawn up.
 So she was planning
on leaving gavin for walt.
 If she divorced gavin,
she'd only get half
of everything they had.
 If he's dead,
she gets everything.
 Gavin swore he saw a gun in
walt yeager's hand that night.
 What if he and mindy
conspired to kill him?
 Unfortunately, these are
all just theories, jamie.
 Without proof, the solicitor's
not going to budge.
 Gavin's going on trial
for murder.
 Not if I can help it.
 Miss sawyer.
 Please, come in.
 (birds chirping)
 Gavin's going
to be put on trial.
 For murder.
But why?
 What about
 "stand your ground"?
Well, that would
 Have been my defense
strategy, but you made
that very difficult,
 If not possible.
You were having
 An affair
with the victim, mindy.
 I know. But I told you...
 I told you I...
Broke it off?
 But that isn't
true, is it?
 I also know
 That you were planning
on divorcing gavin,
 That you were
filing papers.
 That was a mistake.
 Well, all the jury will see
is discord within the marriage,
 That gavin had a motive
to kill walt.
 But I do have one other way
that I can defend gavin.
 You do?
 How?
 I'm going to put you
on the stand.
 Me?
 Wait until I paint a picture
for the jury.
 You and walt were lovers,
 Having kinky sex
in hotel rooms.
 You thought
about divorcing gavin,
 But then you realized...
 Why stop there?
 That is not what happened.
 You told walt to come over
the other night.
 There are no signs
of breaking and
entering because...
 You left the back window
open for him,
 Knowing that
the husband who loved you
 Was lying next to you in bed
 About to be killed.
No, you're wrong.
 I would never, never
do that to him.
 What did you do with walt's gun?
 (soft exhale)
 (sniffs)
 It's... Not real.
 It's a replica.
 I loved gavin, I really did.
 But something
changed, you know.
 I changed.
 I stopped feeling anything.
 I met walt online
on one of those
 Casual hookup sites, and...
 It was just sex.
 It was just a diversion.
 I told walt one night
 That I read
about intruder fantasies.
 The man breaks
into a woman's house,
 And he ends up seducing her
in the bedroom.
 He was role-playing.
 Yeah, but I wasn't.
 I didn't know...
 I didn't know that he was going
to come over that night.
 And walt knew that gavin
was out of town, but...
 He didn't know
he came home early.
 So, after the shooting,
 You hid the gun
before anyone could see it.
 I thought if I didn't
say anything, it would...
 It would go away.
 Gavin shouldn't pay
for what I've done.
 ♪ in my head again
 ♪ taking all the time...
 Gavin.
 What's going
to happen to mindy?
 She'll be brought
up on charges.
 Tampering with evidence,
 Obstruction of justice.
 Gavin:
I am such a fool.
 How could anyone be so blind?
 It's not blindness.
 We all want to trust
people... So badly.
 So, when we do trust someone...
 We give ourselves over
to them... Completely.
 You can't blame
yourself for that.
 Thank you, miss sawyer.
 For everything.

 What are you
doing here?
 $100,000? (scoffs)
 I can't even look at you.
 Well, I have a great case.
 So, if you want to have
a serious discussion,
 We can arrange that.
 Otherwise, if
you don't mind,
 I'm meeting someone.
 You mean lee anne's friend,
charlene wilcox?
 Whoa, what do you
know about charlene?
 Enough to know
that she's not coming.
 Why not?
 Well, if I had to guess,
 I would say
that she is off somewhere
 Celebrating her very recent
promotion to desk sergeant.
 (chuckles)
and let me guess.
 Suddenly, she's not willing
to testify for lee anne.
 (sighs)
 Wait.
 You.
 No, I had nothing to do
with this, jamie.
 I promise. I play fair.
 Though...
 There are some people on my team
who apparently do not.
 Now...
 Here is my final offer.
 And the city has
put a clock on it.
 You have 48 hours.
 Lee anne:
Half a million dollars?
 Oh, my god.
 That's obviously
really good money, lee anne.
 (sighs)
 But?
 Honestly?
 These government agencies
have huge insurance policies.
 It doesn't hurt them
to settle.
 And they get
to walk away scot-free
 Without having to take
any real responsibility
 For their actions.
 So... What are you saying?
 I shouldn't take it?
 No. No, I'm not
saying that.
 But...
 I do need to
remind you
 That if the city is willing
to hand you that much money,
 There's a possibility
of a lot more.
 What if we lose?
 I mean, with 500 grand,
 I can take care of arliss.
 Give us a fresh start.
 Go talk to him.
 Think it over.
 Thank you.
 We've got two
days to decide.
 Good night.
 Good night.
 Good girl, alana.
 Good girl.
 (water running)
 Hello?
 You here?
 Preston?
 Preston:
Hey.
 I'll be out
in a minute.
 Unless you want to come in.
 I'm gonna get some wine.
 (laughs)
 All right.
