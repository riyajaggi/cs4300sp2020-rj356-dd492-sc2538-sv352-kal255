 Hannah Montana (2006â€“2011): Season 3, Episode 20 - Super(stitious) Girl - full transcript 
 Hannah Montana is taking the teen cruise to Hawaii on the S.S Tipton to her concert. While on the ship she loses her lucky anklet that her mom gave her before her first concert. She thinks because she lost her anklet that's why she is having all this bad luck. The maid, Lydia, finds it in her cabin and as she is giving it to Mr. Moseby London snatches it away. When Hannah sees that London has her anklet she tries to get it back. When she tells London the diamonds are fake London drops the anklet into the ocean. As she is pouting about the anklet her wig is picked up by the wind. Lily then tries to dye another wig blond but leaves it too long and it turns green. She says she not doing the concert because of all that's happened, but her dad tells her that her mom will always be in her heart which makes her feel a lot better.

  Attention, students.
 We have now docked in Hawaii,
home of sugar cane, pineapple,
 and your cruise director's
favorite, Kona coffee.
 Finely ground, the two pound bag,
let's not be cheap.
 Unbelievable.
 We're stuck on this
stupid boat for five days
 and now we can't leave
this stupid boat because you
 can't find
your stupid lip gloss!
 lt is not stupid.
 lt has SPF 30,
the healing power of aloe
 and it tastes like coconut!
l like coconut.
 Here's just an idea...
 We just docked in Hawaii,
buy a coconut!
 Oh, like you never forget anything.
 l don't. l'm a professional.
 l have a checklist.
 Wig, got it.
 Single pink glove, got it.
 Mama's lucky anklet...
 Don't got it.
 Where's my lucky anklet?
 Oh, well, maybe little miss
''l'm a professional''
 forgot to put it on
because she was too busy
 insulting her best friend.
Oh, sweet justice.
 Lilly, it's gotta be
in here someplace
 - and l'm not gonna stop searching...
- Found it!
 Oh, Lilly, you're a life saver.
 Oh. You thought l meant the anklet.
 Mm. Coconut goodness.
 Lilly, you know my mom
gave me that anklet.
 - We gotta find it!
- Right. Sorry. l'm on it.
 lt's like a lucky charm.
 Like she's right there
on stage with me.
 - Moseby here.
- Oh! Come in.
 Ah. Miss Montana,
l've cleared the hallway
 and the helicopter is waiting
to take you to your rehearsal.
 Thanks, Mr. Moseby.
Just give me a few minutes.
 Just a few... No, no, no, no...
 l hate to rush you,
but the wind from the helicopter
 is wreaking havoc on
the senior citizens' hula dancing class.
 Grass skirts are flying everywhere.
lt's not pretty.
 Lilly, we have to find it.
 l know it's important,
but we'll find it when we get back.
 l know. lt just doesn't feel right
not having it on.
 Miley, it's gonna be OK.
 lt's just a rehearsal.
Nothing bad's gonna happen.
 That was the worst rehearsal ever!
 lt wasn't that terrible.
 The lighting guy booed.
 Maybe he was calling over
to the sound guy,
 whose name happened to be Boo.
 You know, like, uh...
 ''Hey, Boo!''
 ''Boo!''
 Well, unless Boo's last name
is You Stink, don't think so.
 Lilly, come on, let's face it.
 Everything went wrong
because l don't have Mom's anklet.
 First, we know
the anklet's in this room,
 so we're going to find it.
 Maybe it's in the bathroom.
 And second, the rehearsal
probably went bad because
 you knew you didn't have the anklet
and so you were nervous.
 lt's not like it has magical powers
 and now you're doomed
to a life of terrible things happening.
 Attention passengers,
a student's pet rat
 has managed to escape.
/f you happen to see him,
 please dial nine for housekeeping.
 ls he big?
 You tell me.
 Miley, we've searched
everywhere and all we found
 is rat footprints in my makeup.
 So gross and yet so cute.
 Well, it's not in the drain.
 But l think Hagrid
had this room before us.
 The anklet has got to be
in here someplace.
 See, l was doing my toenails
last night and it was on.
 Then l walked over here
to get a bottle of water,
 but somebody had drank them all.
 Because ''lt's free, it's free.''
 My mom says hydrated skin
is happy skin.
 Thanks to you,
 my skin wouldn't know,
glug-glug girl.
 See, and then, l went to
my dad's room to get some water.
 l remember 'cause I had to do
my freshly-painted toenail walk.
 Then, l got a bottle from him,
and l came right back here.
 So, l never even left the room.
 Not having Mom's anklet not only
makes me unlucky, it makes me...
 Dumb? Stupid? ldiotic?
 l was going to say ''forgetful.''
 That was my next one.
 Oh, hi, um...
 l'm sorry about the room.
 l'm kind of a restless sleeper.
 lt's like Mick Jagger all over again.
 Oh, man.
 Oh, man!
 - Dad!
- Oh! l'm ready! l'm ready!
 Time to get to that rehearsal.
 Daddy, the rehearsal
was an hour ago.
 Was l there?
 Dad, have you seen Mom's anklet?
 Honey, l'm so seasick
l can't see the inside of my eyelids.
 ''Let's take a cruise,
Daddy, it'll be fun.''
 Oh, sweet niblets, here it comes.
 lt's not in my room,
so it has to be in here.
 Lilly?
 Can you please help me?
 l gotta find it before
something else bad happens.
 Oh, come on!
 Well, on the plus side, now it matches
that one glove thing you're doing.
 Super.
 Hey, honey.
Did you check your socks?
 That's it! l slept in
my socks last night!
 l bet it came off
in one of my socks!
 - Daddy, thank you.
- Oh!
 Oh! lf you didn't smell so funky,
l'd kiss you.
 - lt's in my sock.
- ln the sheets.
 - ln a pile.
- On the floor.
 Once l get it on again...
 No more bad luck any...
 Oh, come on!
 l didn't know why you didn't
want to go to Hawaii.
 But now l get it.
 - This is paradise.
- Tell me about it.
 l haven't washed a dish
in five days.
 Sweet.
 Haven't eaten
a sensible meal in three.
 - Oh, man.
- And the best part is,
 haven't held in le gas
since they left.
 Yeah. That one
l figured out on my own.
 One second!
 Oh! Can l do it?
 - Be my guest.
- Yeah.
 - Oh!
- That never gets old.
 Let me guess, guys.
 Parents out of town?
 Oh, yeah.
 So cool. Sign here.
 Excuse me.
 Drop this bad boy right here.
 - Yeah, that's perfect.
- All right.
 - Thanks, man.
- Check you guys later.
 Thanks, man.
 Whoa! Dude, your dad
ordered something from that
 Schlummacker Hummacker
Cool Stuff catalogue.
 l love that catalogue.
 Massage chairs, life-sized robots,
personal submarines!
 And it has the best digital
meat thermometer in the world.
 What?
 lt takes the guesswork out of grilling.
 Hey, Dad.
 You got a package from
Schlummacker Hummacker.
 l'm gonna open it, OK?
 Well, why not?
 'Cause l'm the one who ordered it
 and l want to be
the one to open it.
 - lt's a robot, isn't it?
- lt's a robot?
 Jackson, l'm not playing
guessing games.
 That package better be sealed
when l get home.
 OK, fine.
 Jackson, what about what your dad said?
 What?
 He said he wanted it sealed
when he gets home.
 Well, it will be.
 Nothing. What about you?
 Yeah, me neither.
 But l did find 75 cents and a half eaten
raspberry almond chocolate.
 How'd you know it's raspberry almond?
 Lucky guess.
 Ah, yes.
 Thank you, Lydia.
 l'll put this anklet
in the lost and found.
 And as a reward for your sharp eyes,
 the S.S. Tipton
is proud to present you with...
 Oh-ho! ...a raspberry almond
pillow chocolate.
 Eat it with pride,
but on your own time.
 Ooh! Pretty, sparkly, shiny.
Give me. Give me. Give me.
 l'm sorry, Miss Tipton,
l didn't find this in your room.
 l found it in a passenger's sock.
 Hello. My boat, my passengers,
my shiny thing.
 - Thank you.
- Oh! OK, London.
 Oh, all right.
 l'll hold it for safekeeping
 till the owner shows with
a receipt and two forms of lD.
 lt looks like a storm's coming.
 Moseby, make it go away.
 Oh, of course.
 As soon as l put an iron-on patch
on that hole in the ozone layer.
 Hello! l thought we went over this.
 Me first, humanity second.
 D-R-E-A-M.
 Who's Dr. Eam?
 Miley, look!
London's got your anklet.
 Hey, and she's got great skin.
She must drink a lot of...
 Who cares?
 Now keep your head down.
 The last thing we need
is to be recognized.
 Hey, Han...
 Sorry. But l cannot be mobbed
right now.
 No, l get it.
 You wanna spend
a little one on one time
 with Old ZackDonald.
 Here a kiss, there a kiss,
everywhere a kiss kiss.
 lt's the other one
that's got the girlfriend, right?
 For her sake, l hope so.
 So, let's say
l go to the dessert buffet
 and bring us back
a little strawberry ''shirt'' cake.
 See what l did there?  Zack, you always leave me, uh...
 ...speechless.
 Well, l do have that effect
on the ladies.
 So, l'll be right back
and don't worry,
 l'll bring back a little dessert
for Highlighter Head.
 l'm starting to miss those five days
we were stuck in our room.
  lt looks like gold.
 But just to be sure...
 Eighteen karat...  ...with a hint of sock fuzzies.
 London, hi.
 Hannah! l knew it!
 You thought about it
and realized
 the Yay Me theme song
is your next number one hit!
 London Tipton's really great
Really great, really great
 What is in the water on this boat?
 l don't know, but l hope there's a cure.
l must've had 60 bottles.
 London?
 That's my anklet.
 No, it's called Yay Me.
 My Anklet would be a stupid title
since l never say it in the song.
 Yeah, um, London, what l meant was...
 - ...that anklet...
- Mm-hm.
 ...belongs to me.
 Fine. l'll need to see a receipt
and two forms of lD.
 London, l don't have a receipt!
 My mom gave that to me
before my very first concert
 and l've worn it every show.
 lt's my most special possession.
 - The diamonds are fake.
- Ew!
  No!  What are you so upset about?
l'm the one who had to touch it.
 Are you OK?
 No. Now there's nothing
l can do about it.
 Unless you're willing to dive in?
 Miley, it's gotta be like 60 feet!
 Right. Right.
 You wouldn't have to get me
anything for my birthday.
 - Miley.
- Ever.
 - Miley!
- Fine.
 - l'm really sorry.
- Thank you.
 You know,
we should probably get in.
 lt looks like that storm's
getting closer.
 Who cares?
 What can a stupid storm
do to me now?
 OK, seriously...
 Come on!
 They were out of
strawberry ''shirt'' cake,
 but l've got pudding!
 Sorry. l don't like chocolate.
 Oh, no worries.
 l got vanilla in this pocket,
tapioca in this pocket.
 And napkins in the back.
 Where'd you go?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, l'm thinking it could work.
 ln what world?
 Let's face it, Lilly.
 Ever since l lost my mom's anklet,
nothing's gone right.
 lt's like l'm not meant
to do the concert.
 Oh, look.
 l know how tough
this has been on you.
 And that's why l'm telling you this
as your best friend:
 You're Hannah Montana!
Snap out of it!
 You've never let your fans down
and you're not gonna do it now!
 That wig has got to come off
some day, sister.
 And that day is today!
 lt's time for Miley Stewart
to show this world what she's got!
 Let's rock this island paradise! Whoo!
 Or l could get some hair dye.
 l'm gonna go with the hair dye.
 - But l did like the speech.
- Not enough to do it.
 - Lilly.
- l'll go get the dye.
 Stupid steam, it's not doing anything.
 Are you kidding?
Dude, look at your hair!
 l wouldn't talk, Napoleon Dynamite.
 Oh, man!
 Dude, this isn't working.
 l was hoping l wouldn't
have to resort to this, but...
 ...l think we need a professional.
 So you think you can do it?
 Blindfolded, in my sleep,
 with my tongue.
 But my price, unlike your combined lQs,
 - is high.
- How much?
 lf it's a big robot,
l get to play with it first!
 - Pfft!
- Deal.
 You promised if it was a robot
l could play with it first.
 Do you want it open or not?
 l want it open.
 This better be one of those
''wait for it'' moments.
 Good call.
 What is it?  Well, it's not a robot.
 What's that beeping?
 Can either of you guys
reach my phone?
 No!
 Fine. l think l can hit
the speaker button.
 Hello?
 Hey, how's it going?
 - Good, good...
- Everything's good.
 So, you guys, uh...
 ...pinned against the floor
or smushed up against the window?
 The window.
 Uh-huh. So, Jackson...
 ...next time l get a package,
what ya gonna do?
 Not open it?
 That's my boy.
 Hey, don't worry about it.
 The deflate button
is right there beside the...
 Dad? Dad!
 That's the most fun l've had
this whole darn cruise.
 No!
 We're never gonna get out of here!
 Wait. l think l can pop it
with my fingernail.
 Yeah. Yeah. Give it the fingernail.
 Thank you.
 That was the longest 15 minutes ever.
 Fifteen? l thought you said
the dye stays on for 50?
 Oh, no!
 Maybe it'll dry blonde?
 And then what, fall out?
 Lilly, how many more signs do l need?
 l had to ask.
 l mean, Cody, are you sure we should
bother her before the concert?
 Please, Bailey, we already have
tickets and backstage passes.
 These puppies will get us into
some really cool after-party.
 Hey, Hannah, babe.
 A little thank you
for those concert tickets.
 There is no concert. l'm sorry.
 What?
 ls this going to affect
the after-party?
 OK, Bailey, l know
how disappointed you are...
 No, l'm not.
 lt's a little like the year
everyone forgot my birthday
 and l was so sad
l went and slept in the barn
 until a goat started eating my hair.
 But l'm not disappointed.
 Hey, Bud.
 Dad...
 l can't do the concert.
 l know.
 Lilly told me about your mama's anklet.
 Ever since l lost it,
nothing's gone right.
 l had the worst rehearsal ever.
 l missed steps, l sang flat...
 ...forgot words.
 Honey, now that stuff
happens to every rock star.
 Oh, really?
 Does every rock star end up
with a torn up hotel room,
 a broken mirror, green hair
and a rat on their head?
 That'd be considered a slow night
on an Ozzy Osbourne tour.
 Dad, you don't get it.
 Just...
 ...without Mom up there
on stage with me...
 ...l'm gonna blow it.
 l know what you mean.
l used to worry about the same thing.
 Raising you kids without her.
 But l did it.
 You know how?
 'Cause she was with me
every step of the way.
 Right in here.
 And anklet or no anklet,
 it's the same thing for you.
 She's with you, right there.
 - You really think so?
- l know so.
 Who do you think always reminded me
to bring the back-up wig?
 Huh. Look at that.
 Turning out to be a beautiful day
for a concert in Hawaii.
 Hey! What are you guys
sitting around here for?
 Don't you have tickets to my concert?
And the after-party?
 Let's go.
 Yes!
 Oh, my gosh, Cody, did you do this?
 Bailey, look...
 ...if this relationship
doesn't have honesty,
 it doesn't have anything.
 Yes. Yes, l did.
 Let's rock, Hawaii!
 Take one.
Third camera, mark.
 That wig has got to come off
some day, sister.
 And that day is today!
 lt's time for Miley Stewart
to show this world what she's got!
 Let's rock this...
 Paradise island?
  This is take two.
 That wig has got to come off
some day, sister.
 And that day is today!
 lt's time for Miley Stewart
to show this world what she's got!
 Let's rock this island paradise! Whoo!
 Hi Han...  Sorry.
 But the last thing
l need is to be robbed...
 Not ''robbed'' and not ''last thing''.
 What are you sitting around for?
 Heard you have concert tickets
into the...
 Take two.
 Hey. What are you guys
sitting around for?
