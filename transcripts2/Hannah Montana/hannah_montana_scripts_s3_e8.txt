Pick up nail polish remover and floss... Sorry. I have to get that on the way home. I should've stopped reading but once I started it's just so darn fun the end well said you know Hannah I'm always looking for a great book what's your favourite? my favourite? mine is the James And Giant Peach I just love the idea of a big PEACH Mack no one cares so Hannah you were saying? well you know I just... I just love so many many many books and you know what you should see the stack of books on my bedside table which is a gorgeous table by the way I got it on tour in Japan yeah what a fascinating country as all the countries are in this beautiful magic world it is, isn't it? it's a magic world full of books and your favourite would be? well you know I don't really like picking favourites I think of books as little..uh.. kids. Little paperback bundles of joy! so how could you expect a mother to pick her favourite£¿ my mom did my bother Marvin who grown up to be a bald unhappy pharmacist in long beach who looks good now mom? five days a week people so Hannah why don't we take some questions from your fans in the audience? great I love my fans and people who aren't my fans I love everybody in this beautiful magic world hi I'm Isabel.and I'm confused I used to like carrots but then you said you hated them so then I hated them then you said you liked them so... do I like them now or not? of course carrots are wonderful then why did you say you hated them? were you lying? uh...well Isabel that question took a whole lot of courage and speaking of courage what about that Washington crossing the Delaware oh oh that reminds me what did Dela wear? Maybe a New Jersey I don't know but i'll ask her like Alaska next question I love reading but then you said that you hated it and now you say you like it again and.. I just don't know what to do.. oh no honey don't cry just cause I don't like reading doesn't mean you don't have to so you don't like reading again! - I didn't say that! - yes you did ok ok what I meant was- make up your mind! you're right mommy celebrities are flakes. you're flake you're right seriously Hannah it..it is a bit confusing I mean these kids look up to you, you should just choose your words more carefully that's what I'm trying to do- well you're not doing a very good job okay listen this is what I am not doing I'm not being straightforward with you guys the truth is I hate carrots I always have I always will let me see a show of hands of how many of you guys actually like every single vegetable every vegetable? Brussel sprouts? - To be fair I didn't know that was a vegetable. - of course you didn't that's okay that's okay and hey I love books and I wish I had more time for reading but I don't and just because I can't doesn't mean you shouldn't I mean if one of your friends didn't like carrots or...didn't read much would that stop you from eating carrots or reading? no right so don't do what I do just because I'm famous I think what Hannah saying here is her likes or dislikes are no more important than yours self worth comes from you not from others well that's right not just another pretty face people but it is pretty, isn't it? so do you guys have any more questions for me? I promise to be honest what's your biggest secret? okay now it's time for a beautiful magical commercial see you tomorrow losers go go go 1 2 3 great average with just a hint of dumb, this will be perfect for your next ad uh...next ad? Arvins Learning centre go from brainless to brilliant forget it lady. you humiliated us once and you are not gonna do it again what you call average we call real so maybe we don't look like that guy, who does? will that guy looks like.... we're not gonna apologize for who we are- yeah and there is nothing- nothing In this world that would ever make us compromise our integrity EVER again. - ever again! - ÄÜ¹»ÔÙ´ÎÈÃÎÒÃÇÎª×Ô¼ºµÄÕýÖ±¶øÍ×Ð­£¡ I'll give you each 1000 dollars - So like mildly dumb or super dumb? - we can do it all
