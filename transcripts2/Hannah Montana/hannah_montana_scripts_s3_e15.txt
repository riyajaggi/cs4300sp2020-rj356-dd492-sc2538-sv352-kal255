So I stuffed a chilli dog on the way over, I can't be Mr wonderful without a little pooch in the pouch. I can't believe I'm paying for this Looks like you can afford it. Haho, nice place! Wow, is that one of those new wafer-thin computers that weighs less than a slice of lunch meat? I don't know, I don't weigh my lunch meat. Are you sure? cause this is two-hundred-dollar digital food scale begs to differ. Would you please focus? Lilly and Oliver are gonna be here, and I need to make sure you got the story... Mmh. I need to make sure you got the story straight, Your parents are moving away, but we are gonna keep a long distance relationship, because we are so in love. Yeah yeah yeah, I got it. I got it. Hi, guys. Miley what's the matter? Ralphie is moving away. What? His parents are going to England. Oh, wow, what a shame. Tell me about it, I don't even know how to speak 'englandish'. I'm gonna miss that sense of humor so much. Eh, you konw it's eh, whoo, it's gonna be ok Because my dermatologist has a son, he is so cute. You want to know why? and might get you a little discount on your stach bleaching. Thank you, but Ralphie and I are gonna make it work. We are just gonna have a long distance relationship. I mean good for you guys, that's gonna be great between you guys. Why? When you find somenthing as special as this, it's worth holding onto and not dating other people. It is worth holding onto. I don't want to say goodbye to you or my two new wonderful friends You know what? I'm not moving. I'm not giving up what we have without a fight, What? Look at you, you're a wreck. No, I'm not, see I'm really. Yeah, I will pull myself together. My mascara's not even running, see? I want you remember me like his, go, go now, go now, Ralphie. No, no, no, no, no way. I will go live with my grandma. -No, you won't! -Sure I will! Would Romeo leave Juliet? Would Troy leave Gabriella? -Would you join me in the kitchen? -OK I'm not sure I'm ready to give up this relationship. What are you doing? Please don't say you are falling in love with me. Ha, yeah, right The only thing I've fall in love with is this programmable coffee maker with built-in bean grinder and single cup convenience. You wouldn't! I bet you want me to go away. Fine. Well, as much as I would like to stay, my grandma just texted me that the condo didn't accept anyone under seventy five. so sadly, I must be going. But to remember me by please take our family coffee maker. Oh, no, no, no, stop, stop it, she's gonna make me cry, ok. Go, go quickly, Ralphie. and remember, wherever you are, my love and my coffee maker we'll go with you. -I can't. -Oh, yes you can. Oh. No, no, no, I can't. The hole in my heart is too big to be filled by such a small household appliance. How big is the hole, Ralphie? I don't know. About the size that plasma screen TV over there. I think I got something better, for you to keep closer to your heart. Ralphie boy, should've stopped with the coffee maker. You know, can't help feeling this is partly our fault. Well it's just that we were so happy, we wanted you to be so happy too. Partly? -I am happy. -Of course you are. -I am. -Whatever you say. -Let it go. -Ok. Look when it's time for me to have a boyfriend, I will. But for right now, all I need is my best friends. And they're promised to stop trying to set me up unless you know Robert Pattinson. Are you kidding? If I knew Robert Pattinson, I would totally set you up with him. Nice save. Oh, come on, Olliepop, you know you are my guy. -I'd better be. -You are. -Ok. -Ok. -Ok. -Ok. Oh, guys, guys, did I forget to mention? Blah! Hey, Miley, Come on, we will go catch a movie. I think the new Will Smith one starts in like Why do I keep looking? Getting a text from Ralphie. "Look in Oliver's backpocket." Hey our watches. Wow, that guy is good. Hold on, "now check in Lilly's backpocket." Ewgh!! No, they are mine. Are those Ralphie's?
