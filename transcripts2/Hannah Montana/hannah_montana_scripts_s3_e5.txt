 Dad's going to love the
new hairdryer I got him.
 Three temperatures, four speeds, and extra
long cord for that hard to reach back hair.
 Your Dad blow dries his back hair?
 My mornings are not pretty.
 - Oh and
- did I mention it comes with a free comb?- Cool.
 What are you getting Jackson?
 I was thinking a comb.
 - Hey, who's the hottie with Oliver ...
- Dibs!
 Wait!
 That's not fair!
You know the rules.
 No buzzing until I
complete a question!
 Sorry honey. But when they're
cute there are no rules.
 Hey, now you can't
give it to Jackson.
 Sure I can!
 Hey! Oliver, how you doing?
Get some Christmas shopping done?
 - You know, I actually got my Mom -
--- Yeah,She'll love it.
 You are?
 Extremely happy I didn't order
this with onions. I'm Connor.
 I'm Miley.
 I'm Lily, but she buzzed in early.
 - Again?
- Tell me about it.
 So, ar, who you shopping for?
 Your mom... your dad...
your... girlfriend?
 No, I'm just grabbing a bite before work.
I have a part time job here at the mall.
 Oh cool! But if you were shopping for
your mom, your dad and your girlfriend
 and you already got your mum and dad
something would you still be shopping?
 It depends. Anything in this
mall you might be interested in?
 I've got my eye on something.
 Ar, excuse me, I'm just going to
head over to Bed, Bath and Barfbag!
 Hey guys!
 Hey Sofie.
 Hey Oliver. Um, I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to go catch a movie tonight?
 Ar, sorry Sofie,
I'm going out of town. Tonight.
 Yeah, I'm doing some roady work for this
cool new band - ar... Restrooms this way.
 Oh, OK, well maybe next time?
 Sure. Will do that.
We'll go next time.
 The restrooms this way? Who's there
opening act, the "place trays here"?
 OK, Lily, I can't go out with her.
I mean, she's cute, but
 did you see the size of her feet?
 You are turning her down because of one,
little physical thing?
 Little? Miley, Big Foot called her last
week to borrow a pair of her slippers!
 Oh!
 Oh.
 Dude, I'm with Miley on
this one. That's cold.
 Yeah! And you're being
totally shallow.
 Besides, she was kind of cute.
 Cute, she wasn't cute!
Did you see the size of her feet?
 You know... you're funny.
 Yeah. That's what I was going for.
 Hey, Miley, would you want to go to
the holiday carnival with me tonight?
 I'd love to.
 So I'll meet you there?
 Yeah... I will.
 See! I'm going to the carnival
with someone totally nice.
 Something you would be doing
if you weren't so judgmental!
 Yeah face it Oliver,
Miley's just the bigger person.
 Later guys.
 Sweet Niblets! I got a
date with a Sweet Niblet!

 - Well, well, well.
- Don't!
 Now Miley, there's no reason
to be 'short-tempered'.
 Oliver. Cut it out! Sure she was
surprised, but she's not gonna'
 What I'm saying is, she can rise above...
You try it, it's harder than you think!
 I was a little caught off guard.
 See I, unlike you, can pass the
difference in our... various altitudes.
 Various altitudes? Miley,
come on, face it.
 You're as shallow as I am.
But the diffrence is, I admit it.
 For instance
 weird headline
 too many freckles!
 Oh, here we go, hey Baby,
how you doing?
 Back off, helmet hair.
 Shallow! and I respect that.
 Well I don't. Me and Connor are going
to have a great time tonight because...
 Good things come in small packages?
 OK, look, I'm sorry,
it's a bad hobit... habit!
 That one was an accident.
 Hmm... got a little bit
of a tilt there, buddy.
 Oh
 Oh, dang flab it!
 There. Straight as an arrow.
 Dad, hey Dad!
 Cut the tree too short again?
 No! Don't be silly.
 Just soaring up some firewood,
that's all.
 We don't have a fireplace.
 It's always the negative
with you, isn't it!
 Well not today! Because I just got
back from the college of my dreams!
 State University of Santa Barbra!
 Amazing beaches, beautiful babes
and a party on every block.
 - How are the classes?
- The what?
 The classes. You did look
into the classes, right?
 Oh yeah... lots of them.
 They all had big blackboards and other...
educational learning stuff.
 Jackson. Santa Barbra's a great school son,
but it's not all that easy to get into.
 I know, but I've got
it all figured out.
 See, I may not have the greatest grades,
but I only need one thing to get myself through the door.
 Harry Potter's cloak
of invisibility?
 Harry Potter's cloak
of invisibility? No!
 A letter of reccommendation.
 Son, I don't want to be the mouldy
cheese in your refrigerator of hope...
 but, where are you going to find
somebody to write you that letter?
 Right there. Right next to where it says
Major Contribution made by Influential .
 That looks just like...
 Not bad, Stewart.
 But you're going to have to do a lot more
than this if you want to get a letter of reccomendation out of me.
 Yes Mr. Dontzig... very good Mr.
Dontzig... anything you say... Mr. Dontzig!
 Hey, what's going on back there?
I've lost that gloving feeling!
 'lovin feeling! Laugh at my jokes!

up nicely. Get the clippers!
