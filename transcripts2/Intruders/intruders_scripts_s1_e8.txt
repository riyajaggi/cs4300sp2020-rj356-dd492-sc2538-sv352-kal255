 Someone helped Marcus Fox return. You tell them you're still looking for me. And when I'm back, they'll never see me coming. Go, Meadow! Go! (SCREAMING) We ever meet a third time, it's 'cause someone's told me to kill you. What do they want? What do they believe? GARY: What they believe is that every body has two lives, two souls. JACK: What is this shit?

 It's a symbol of a person I was and can be again. They trigger me back. Just because you can live again doesn't mean you should. GARY: They're all tied up with this Psychomancy Trust. Todd Crane, Marcus Fox, Rose Gilchrist. JACK: Gary! No! No! (CRASHING) (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) We have a special guest in the audience. Been on a little break, but said he might blow some sweet sounds for us.

(SOBBING) (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) GARY: Everyone has been here before. I am gonna fight for her. We'll all be back again in another body... But the only way we beat them is from the other side. JACK: It was another soul. GARY: In the beginning, there was death. (SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE) DISPATCHER: 911. State the nature of your emergency. My name is Jack Whelan. DISPATCHER: What's your emergency, sir? East Third Street... 999, East Third Street. The Burnell-Lytton building. A man has... A man has jumped from the roof. He's... He's not breathing. Hey. Todd? Todd, you still with me? Hey. Hey. Oh, man. (TODD GROANS) JACK: Stay with me, buddy. Stay with me. Okay. (GROANING) All right. What happened, Todd? Come on, what happened? Where did they go?

(DOOR CLOSING) (MURMURING WEAKLY) (METAL CLATTERS IN DISTANCE) (DOOR UNLOCKS) (AIR WHOOSHING) (GEARS WINDING) (JACK GRUNTS) (DOOR SHUTS) (HUFFING) Richard shouldn't know that anything is coming. Rose wants us to wait until after Cranfield's burial. Then we kill him. (SIREN WAILING) BLANCHARD: Okay, I got a call. Some patrolmen found a 9-year-old girl downtown. She's got no ID, but she fits your daughter's description. But she's frightened, and she's not talking. (ALLISON SNIFFLES) She's not Madison. She's not Madison! No. Please, not Madison. No. Not Madison. No, please, not Madison. No, please... No. No. No! No! No... (GRUNTING) Not the wall! No! (SCREAM ECHOES) (BREATHING HEAVILY) We warned you, Marcus, over all your lives that your behaviour risked exposing all Reverti. Now you join the few who can never come back. MARCUS: I'll come back. (GRUNTS) (WHIMPERS) Please. Please. (SCRAPING) Just keeping my end of the deal. If you're gonna do it, do it. You must have a lot of faith, you're willing to die like this. There's no faith to it. It's science. It's how it works. So, shut up and do it. I'm in a hurry to get back. Hey... I trust you, Ritchie. Mmm-hmm. Night, Marcus. I'll see you in 18 years. (CHUCKLES) DISPATCHER: Code 30.

Goodbye. Goodnight. Screw you. Screw you. You, you. You, you, you. And you! (CLANGING) (SIREN WAILING) All right, stay, just stay there. We have an eyewitness placing Madison here. (CLANGING CONTINUES) MADISON: Oh, God. -(KNIFE SLASHES) -Whoa! Give it back. Is that what you did to Todd Crane? He shouldn't have dicked around with me, and neither should you! Give it back! I saw you earlier today. You were in, uh... You were in Crane's apartment. I know you from before. You're, um... You're Amy Whelan's husband, right? You and me have something in common. We do, huh? How could we possibly have anything in common? Rose ruined both of our lives. I'm here to kill her. You? Wait a second. Are you the girl from Portland? Uh... Uh... - Madison O'Dell? - No! No, no, no, no, no! That kid is gone! It is just me now. It is Marcus Fox. Okay? Marcus Fox has been dead for 10 years. Nine years, actually. October 5th, 2005 at 2:00am. Rose Gilchrist, Howard Charles and Mohammed Barad, and six Shepherds came and got me. They brought me here, and they buried me alive! I paid a Shepherd $1 million to bring me back. Wait, I know the detective who investigated that case. Blanchard, right? That jagoff. I also know what Marcus Fox looks like. Then you'll recognise the body they buried behind that wall. (SIGHS) You're afraid to see, aren't you? Because then it could all be true. And if it is, we go kill her, you and me. This is... (SIGHS) All right, get out of the way. (SMASHING) MADISON: Wow. That one there is the real me. I can't help who I am. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) They're here. No, wait, wait. You're not killing anybody. Yes, I am. That's what I do. Listen, whoever you are, you are a 9-year-old girl, and you are staying right here. All right. All right. (JACK GRUNTS) (SIREN WAILING) (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) (BONES CRUNCHING) In the beginning, there was death. No more. (FLAMES CRACKLING) (COUGHS) Fire! BLANCHARD: Two-Charlie-Zero-Four, we got a fire at 999 East Third Street. (CLAMORING) Richard. Richard? - Richard, hurry! -Amy. This is done. I'm burning this place down, and I'm taking you home where you belong. This is where I belong! Get out! (RUNNING FOOTSTEPS) Get away from her! Get away from her right now! - Both of you. -lt's Marcus Fox. Shoot! Back away! AMY: Shoot him! MADISON: No. (SIGHING) Come on, let's get out of here now. JACK: Amy. RICHARD: GO, go. (GUNSHOT) (JACK COUGHS) (POLICE RADIO CHATTER) (AMY COUGHS) BLANCHARD: Two-Charlie-Zero-Four... (COUGHING) - Let's go. -JACK: Amy! (AMY COUGHING) (SIREN WAILING) (COUGHING) Madison! Madison! SIMON: Madison! ALLISON: Oh, my God! Madison! Madison! SIMON: Please, there's our daughter. Madison! - Mom? -Madison! Oh, my God, Mom! (JACK COUGHING) ALLISON: Madison! - Yes! -SIMON: Madison, come here. End it now! (ALLISON SCREAMS) Get down! SIMON: Oh, my God, Madison! (TIRES SCREECH) ALLISON: (WAILING) No, no. SIMON: Madison, Madison. Hey, wake up. ALLISON: It's okay. It's okay. I'm here. SIMON: Wake up, honey. (TIRES SCREECH) OFFICER: Paramedics are on-site. Help! We need help here! OFFICER: Over here, over here. PARAMEDIC: Stand aside, please. Please, stand aside. Let me through. Is this your daughter? Yes! We're getting nothing. You get the mask, I'll start CPR. ...eight, nine, ten. One, two, three, four... SIMON: Come on, Maddie. (FLATLINE) One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine... The only way a body can get rid of one of its souls is at the moment of death. Sorry. Kid. But this is that time for you. I'm going back, and you're staying here. See, my will is stronger. And sorry, too. But from here, this place, there's no going back. I feel sorry for you. You've lived a few hundred lives, but you haven't learned a thing. Taking lives is so easy, but it gets you nowhere. It does nothing. And in all those lives, you've never learned that there's nothing stronger than a kid wanting to be with their mom and dad. Hey, Marcus, what goes around stays right here. (GASPS) SIMON: Madison, it's okay. It's all right. (MADISON COUGHING) (AMY WINCES) Why did you bring back Marcus Fox? You knew he'd come after me. I needed the money. My brother was sick, and I wanted to run away with you. Amy, with Amy, and I thought the money would get us -wherever we wanted to go. -Amy... I don't know who that is. We have to get back to Bix. Somebody took him. Rose, I think, uh, Bix took himself. (BREATHING DEEPLY) You ate a lot of smoke down there in that basement. You and your wife, what, in a freemasonry-type deal? Or a cult? All this was taped to Gary Fischer's chest. Tesla? Pictures of John Adams, Gandhi, Mozart... All Qui Reverti? What's this? Gary... I think he was insane. I'm sorry about Fischer, Jack. The little girl from Portland. Is she all right? Down in the children's ward. Under guard. Can I see her? What if you came with me? She said a man took her over. You said "Marcus Fox.“ Marcus Fox is dead. We never found his body. What did you see, Jack? Did you see Marcus Fox down there? His body is in that basement. Fire was contained underground. Anything down there is ash. Well, I don't know. I'm not one of them. The people who would know, they took off in the fire. Then they all got away, even your wife. She's not my wife. He was there last night. I saw him in the alley. Is he part of this group? I'll find out. I will find out, Jack. If Fox is part of this group, cult, whatever, then, to me, they're all just suspects, even your wife. Whatever she is. I will not quit until I know Marcus Fox is gone. Hi. Uh... I'm Jack Whelan. I was in the alley. Of course. You saved Madison. Thank you. I didn't want to disturb you. I just... I wanted to make sure she was... Okay. It was scary. But I'm okay now. (WHISPERS) He's gone. Is he? Are you sure? How do you know? Mr Whelan... Thank you for what you did for Madison, really. I can't thank you enough. She needs some rest. Sure. (ensues) Hey... Come here. Yeah? (SPEAKS SPANISH) (SPEAKS SPANISH) (DIALING PHONE) (CALL RINGING) GARY ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi, you've reached Julie, Gary, and... CHILD: Emily! GARY: (LAUGHING) Leave a message. (BEEP) Hello. This is Jack Whelan. You don't have to call me back. I... I just wanted to tell you I... I knew Gary, and, uh. You're gonna hear a lot of things said about him in the next few days. None of it is true. He didn't ask for...this, for what happened. He was trying to make it right. He loved Emily very much. She should know that her dad was a good person. I'm very sorry for your loss. And mine. Maybe... We'll meet again. (SIGHS) I have it. Come on in, Jack. Take a seat. So she sent you to kill me, too, huh? See, the thing is we Shepherds don't ever kill anyone, ever. We just... Take them out of the game, put them on the sidelines for a while. Because... "We don't die?" (SIGHS) What I've learned, working for them... What you will come to understand... (CLEARS THROAT) ls that... (SIGHS) In the end... There is no end. We could have killed you so easily. Didn't you ever wonder why we didn't? Because... You know what I'm capable of. I mean, I could almost be one of you, right? RICHARD: And now... You are.
