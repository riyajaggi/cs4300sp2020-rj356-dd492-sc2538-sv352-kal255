 We're just here to shepherd you. It's all right. It's okay. Shh... (RETCHING) (VOMITING) You'll see that some of them fight it. Sometimes, it takes years, when the older one doesn't want to give up. Oh, no. Oh, no. No. There's a good... Shh... Shh... (MUTTERING IN ARABIC) (THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

 (THUNDER RUMBLES) (BANGING ON DOOR) JUDY: Who is it? RICHARD: FBI. Special agent Shepherd, looking for William Anderson. It's late. May I see some identification? Bill's not here. RICHARD: If Bill Anderson's inside, and you're not telling the truth, you're both in a bit of trouble. - Where is he? -(GASPING) Where is he? (GASPING) RICHARD: Do you know where he is? JUDY: I don't know! I don't know! RICHARD: Tell me where he is. I don't know where he is! RICHARD: Quiet down. Calm down! JUDY: Don't hurt us, please. - Goddamn. -JUDY: I don't know! No, I don't know, I don't know! (GUNSHOTS) (GASPING) Oh, God. Oh, God. MATT: Hello. This is 5122 Glenview Parkway. Uh... There's an intruder in our house. He has a gun. Uh, my mom... He's coming! (GASPS) (SIGHS) (THUD) (EXHALES) (GROANING FAINTLY) (METAL CLANGING) (LIQUID SLOSHING) (FIRE CRACKLING) (SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE) (GULLS SQUAWKING) (SHOP BELL JINGLES) (KNOCKING ON GLASS) (CHUCKLES) - BOBBI: Hey, Jack. -Hey. Isn't it Amy's birthday tomorrow? Why don't you come in and get her a present? No, it's, it's today, but she hates her birthday, so we hardly ever celebrate each other's birthday. There she is. Amy... Bobbi says it's your birthday. Yes, it is, Brud, but this birthday I could do without. No. My life didn't even begin till I was your age. - Come on. -(CHUCKLES) - See you guys. -BRUD: Bye-bye. Bye. Amy! Come on! (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (CLEARS THROAT) (LAUGHS) What the hell is this music? I thought you hated jazz. (WHISPERS) It was private. I respect that. I just never heard you listen to it before is all. (EXHALES) Sorry, honey. I guess the music just took me away-. PERDU: Tonight. As I speak to you of them... I fear no one. I don't say this because my location is unknown or my podcast is so well sock-puppeted. No. I fear no one because fear derives from the unknown. For the last three weeks, I've been telling you about Bill Anderson, and now you know about...them. Qui Reverti. The ones who tried to kill him. His wife, Judy, and his son, Matt, lost their lives when they tried to keep this from us. They cannot silence us. Not Bill Anderson, not me, not you. So, when they come knocking at your door, honor Judy and Matt Anderson, don't be afraid to answer, because this life is ours. It's not theirs. No, no, no, no, it is not theirs. Fear no one. Be...loud. This is Professor Perdu calling to you from everywhere... ...and nowhere. Over and out. (THUNDER RUMBLING) This is not a birthday present, so don't give me any shit. (LAUGHS) You want to go now? Yeah. We should. You've not been yourself. Make a wish. (FLAMES CRACKLE) Try some. It's your cake. - Oh, come on, it's good. Come on. -No. JACK: It's yours. - Mmm. -You know what? - Hmm? -Now I want some. (LAUGHS) (KISSING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) WOMAN: (SINGING) ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear Madison ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ (MOBILE PHONE CHIMING) WOMAN: What do you want, Simon? We are blowing out Madison's candles. No. Listen, I don't care that you're her father. Madison doesn't want to talk to you. Because she doesn't. (SIGHING) Oh, God, Simon. Simon... Madison, where are you going? Stay away from the water. (DOOR SLAMMING) Got your cell, or you at the office? Cell. Don't call the office. (JAZZ PLAYING ON THE RADIO) Bye. Amy? (WHISPERS) Yeah. (WHISPERS) Okay. (CLOTH FLUTTERING IN WIND) (WHISPERS) No... (LOUD KNOCKING ON DOOR) Who is it? GARY: FBI. How come you got so much older, but I didn't? Gary Fischer? The dead do come back to life, huh? (CHUCKLES) Come on in. Last I heard about you, years ago, was that you had ended up in... Indiana? - Illinois. Evanston. -Ah! Outside Chicago. I'm out here in Seattle handling an estate. I'm a lawyer. After your book came out, I called LAPD to find you, and they said you'd moved up here. How'd you find this place? My wife found it. Amy? That's her name, right? Is Amy around? You ask that like you don't want her to be. No, no, not at all. Just... How did you know how to find me here, at this specific address? Oh, your neighbours, the Zimmermans. When I drove in, I saw your display on their window. I saw you yesterday, Gary. I saw your car with the Illinois plates. You knew I was there, but you waited until Amy left the house, until there was no one around here. So you came to one of the only cops you know personally because you're in some kind of trouble, right? Where can we talk? Here is good. No, it's not. I can't tell you that. Mom, I can't lie to you about it. I don't know. Hang on. Maddy? Everything okay? Couldn't be better. GARY: All right, three weeks ago, here in Seattle, a mother and her son, 16 years old, were murdered in their home. Judy and Matt Anderson. JACK: The husband. It's always the husband. GARY: The boy referred, in the 911 call, to an "intruder" in the house. He didn't say his father. JACK: Where is he, the father? GARY: Nobody knows. Bill Anderson. He's an acoustics engineering professor at the University of Washington. At the time of the murders, Anderson was out with two other husky science professors. What's this to you? It's related to an estate case I'm on back in Chicago. JACK: Just related? You come all this way out here to tell me? Out in the woods? GARY: You're a cop. Were a cop. Plus, living in the state where it happened. Might make a good story for your next book. You do have investigative experience. JACK: You know I was never going to make detective there. GARY: Not after what happened. JACK: ls that your way of telling me you somehow got access to my personnel record? GARY: Jack, look, I just heard about it, thought you might be interested in it as a cop author. (SIGHS) This Bill Anderson guy either kills himself in a week, or gets caught in 18 months with some waitress in pig's knuckle, Iowa. Always ends the same. They have one life to live and they can't help blowing it. Yeah. I'd better be going, Jack. It was good to see you, though. Yeah, you too. Come on. (MADISON GROANING) (GASPING) (MOANING) (MOBILE PHONE RINGING) AMY: Hi, you've reached Amy Whelan. I'm not available right now. Please leave a message. (BEEPING) Amy. It's just me. Again. Weird not to hear from you. Love you. MAN: Alpha, Oscar, three, Charlie, Zulu. Come in. (STATIC CRACKLING) Alpha, Oscar, three, Charlie, Zulu. Come in. Unknown caller, by failing to identify yourself, you are conducting an illegal radio transmission. MAN: Oz Turner? (STATIC CRACKLING) I-I-9-9-R-C... There is no caller by that handle at this location. Over. MAN: Mr. Turner, we need to talk. No, we don't. MAN: It's about Bill Anderson. (MOBILE PHONE RINGING) Amy. you all right? MAN: You lose a phone? Who is this? MAN: George. Seattle cab driver. I just found this phone in the back seat. Yeah. Uh, uh, a woman? When was she in the cab? GEORGE: Don't know. Um, blonde, business suit. GEORGE: I drive a lot of people. Okay, uh, listen, she's been gone for two days. I've been trying to get a hold of her. Now I know why I haven't heard from her. Can you hang on? Do you know Le Soleil hotel? GEORGE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. JACK: Okay. If you drive near it, could you drop the phone off at Le Soleil hotel for Amy Whelan? Amy Whelan. I'll call and tell them to expect you. GEORGE: 50 bucks. JACK: All right. All right, you know where and who? MAN: Yeah, yeah. Andy Whelan. Le Soleil. Amy! No! Amy! (MUTTERING) God damn it. (LINE RINGING) MAN: Good evening, Le Soleil hotel, Seattle. Amy Whelan, please. Certainly. I'm sorry. May I have that name again? Amy Whelan. I'm her husband. We do not have a guest registered under the name Amy Whelan at the present time. She would have checked in two days ago. I'm sorry, sir. Okay, look, um... A cab driver called and said he'd found my wife's cell phone. I told him to drop it off there. May I do that and advance his reward from my credit card? When I find her, I'll have Amy pick it up. Sure. That would be fine. Thank you. (KEYS CLACKING) (EXCLAIMS) Hey, sweetie. Can you keep a secret? Go ahead, take it. Nine years goes fast, eh, Marcus? (GASPING) (GASPING) Please... Please. Please don't kill me. My name is not Marcus! It's not Marcus. I'm just a kid. I'm Madison. I don't know who Marcus is. (SCREAMING) Mommy! Mommy! Please don't kill me. (SHIVERS) JACK: Hey, thanks for letting me borrow it. I'm sorry it's so last minute. I'll have it back tomorrow. One quirk about this car, though, Jack, the engine mounts should've been replaced years ago. (ENGINE BANGING) (BANGS DASHBOARD) (BEEPS) (LINE RINGING) WOMAN: Good afternoon. Kerry, Crane and Hardy. Hi, uh, Amy Whelan, please? WOMAN 2: Can I help you? Yes. Amy Whelan, please. WOMAN 2: Mr. Crane is in a meeting at the moment. Well, that's great. I'm looking for Amy Whelan. WOMAN 2: I'll have him return your call. Sir, you said you'd be right out. Sure, uh, just one second. Of course, sir, but in that second, should I park the car or have it towed? (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) - Professor Perdu. -Mr. Segreto? How did you... (CLEARS THROAT) How did you get my cell number? And my radio call-sign? (CHUCKLES) Well, if I didn't, you'd think you were dealing with amateurs, right? People far beneath your own capabilities. I understand the need to keep your broadcasts oblique. If people knew what we even suspect... It would all fall apart. I mean, people like us have a responsibility, don't we? Tell me, Oz, if I may use your real name? This theory... ls it yours? I met a guy in Seattle. Bill Anderson. He's working on something in his basement. He's got some way out there ideas, but he's an acoustics engineering professor at the University of Washington, so... Like, he told me that, uh... All of the major cathedral organs in Europe have 32-foot organ pipes that produce infrasound. That's a sound too low for the human ear to hear. Why? What unknown effects do these frequencies have on us? Through sound, Mr. Segreto, they are able to experience other...frequencies. And now we have to teach others to hear these frequencies again. Tell me, if we could hear them, what, for example, would we hear? How to never die. Who else knows of your research? (CHUCKLES) Oh, well, there's stuff that I talk about on my radio show, but only Bill and me know the really mind-blowing parts of his theory. Well, it's been good talking to you, man. I've been looking for someone who understands...frequencies. Mr. Segreto. (CLEARS THROAT) I thought that you came here so that we could talk about them. (WHISPERS) Oh, yeah, we will soon. Real soon. (PANTING) No... (STOPS PANTING) (PANTING) No! (CHUCKLES) Hi, Lupe! Hi, buddy. Come here. Aw. (CAT PURRING) I'm going to take a bath now. You don't like baths. (CAT PURRING) (CAT YOWLING) (WATER SPLASHING) Oh, my God. Oh, my... Oh, my God. (SHUDDERING) Oh, my God, what have I done? (SOBBING) What have I done? What have I done! Lupe... Lupe! (MOBILE PHONE CHIMES) (MICROWAVE BEEPING) Ow! MAN ON TV: ...world politics, and food supplies. They meet behind closed doors each year to discuss private agenda. Are they really a secret society of power-brokers? Or is it a conspiracy theory? Find out next, as we uncover the mystery of the Bilderberg Group. Activists line the gate to the hotel, where the Bilderbergs are conducting their annual meeting. Members arrive in darkened limousines. Surrounded by tight security... (BANGING ON DOOR) Many of the activists have been following the Bilderbergs for decades. (BANGING CONTINUES) (THUNDER RUMBLES) RICHARD: Oz? Oz, I know you're in there. I have something to tell you, about them. I'm heavily armed. I understand, man. It's hard to trust people, I understand. More than you know. My life is in danger coming here to talk to you. It's in danger just being outside your door. (SIGHS) RICHARD: I was going to tell you something about Bill Anderson, but, I get it, I get it. I got to go. Wait. RICHARD: Hey. (CHUCKLES) Oh, shit. What don't you got? (CHUCKLES) No "I want to believe" poster? (COCKS RIFLE) Why don't you just tell me what you came here to tell me? Oz, you should be proud of yourself. They do exist. And we don't die. (YELPS) - But you do. -No, please. I... (GASPING) (GUNSHOT) (LINE RINGING) (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) Hello? (JAZZ MUSIC CONTINUES) (PHONE BEEPING) (MOBILE PHONE VIBRATING) Who's this? MADISON: You know who it is. RICHARD: Marcus... MADISON: You brought me back too early, and I know why. But Shepherd... What goes around comes around. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) She said she was with the Tsar's secret police. Because in the beginning, there was death. RICHARD: I'll find her, and I will bring her back from where she came. Happily ever after. (GUNSHOT) (LOUD THUD) JACK: Who the hell were those guys? Those guys were after you. Where's your wife? I'm traveling alone. No, you're not. Step aside, please. You're not sorry, but you will be. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) Ripped By mstoll Happy New Year 2015 - New Year, New Color ;-)
