 Amy? Bill Anderson. He's an acoustics engineering professor at the University of Washington. Why didn't you take Cranfield's money? He wanted me to cease my research. But if I accepted the money and kept working, there would be consequences. JACK: What were you building? I made a ghost machine. Get down! Call me Marcus.

 You tell them you're still looking for me. And when I'm back, they'll never see me coming. (SIREN WAILING) (CHURCH MUSIC PLAYING) (SIREN CONTINUING) BLANCHARD: Three units this side, two units to the back. Let's go. -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Marcus Fox? Seattle police officers! We have a warrant to search the premises. (KNOCKING CONTINUING) Take it down. (RAMMING DOOR) (MUSIC PLAYING)

 Ripped By mstoll Happy New Year 2015 - New Year, New Color ;-) Why do I get the feeling, we finally catch this guy, he's gonna be armed with a knife? (STATIC PLAYING ON RECORD) OFFICER 1: (ON RADIO) Grounds are clear of Marcus Fox, sir. Looks like he knew we were coming. (RETCHING) (VOMITING) Found them. (SHUDDERING) OFFICER 2: Looks like eight victims. Four males, four females. Bodies are all bound with rope. I've never seen anything like this. -(DOG BARKING) -OFFICER 3: Easy, boy! Easy! Down! Down! BLANCHARD: Take off those boards. OFFICER 3: Yes, sir. (DOG CONTINUES BARKING) How many bodies are under here? (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (CAMERA CLICKING) BLANCHARD: Did it seem that Anderson recognised the gunman at all? Never saw him coming. Like I said, this guy knew what he was doing. It wasn't his first time. It was like he couldn't care less. Couldn't care less about... Anything. Well, I'll be sure to put that in the BOLO, "6'2", dark hair, nihilistic disposition." Did you manage to get any information out of Anderson? We talked about, uh... The check from Gary's client I was telling you about. The one he... He wouldn't accept, because of the conditions attached. Which were? That he stop work on some private project he was doing. He had built a... Machine. It was something to do with sound frequencies, radio waves... Most people have been looking at 18 hertz, but I experiment at 19. Low frequencies? What's it supposed to be for? He was just getting to that when the ceiling fell in. (SIGHING) Look, I'm cutting you some slack, because the other witnesses are consistent on how you reacted when the gunman came in, but as for your buddy, Fischer, how well do you know him? Until a couple of weeks ago, I hadn't seen him since high school. So, not at all? Look, I thought I was helping an old friend, and then I thought I might be able to help this poor guy. Please tell me you're not gonna try and help anyone else anytime soon. You hear me? Finally. (KEYS JINGLING) Hello there, young lady. Are you lost? No. No, not really. Well, this is an office building. Unless you work in an office here, which I'm sure you don't, you should go back outside. Nice tits. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Hey. Oh, tell Rose the Anderson job's done. She's heard. Your work is getting sloppy. Making all that noise to maintain silence. Frank, Bill Anderson wasn't worth their concern in the first place. There are more urgent problems. Come on. I stood in line a long time for that Americano. The barista dick who made it, now, his work was really sloppy. No one cares about doing a good job any more. We have to, Rich. My life was shit. You pulled me out of it when you recruited me. I owe you for that. I will not let you down. You owe Reverti. I had nothing to offer. Only offered what was theirs to give. Frank, if this... ls the way that life works... Then it's not just theirs. It should belong to everyone. Don't talk that way. Stop it now. Frank... (SIGHING) All the years that you've put in, all the service, things you've seen... You've never questioned them? Just two guys talking? (SCOFFS) Two guys talking. Rose asked me to do something for her. Off the books. Way, way off. She asked me to find someone. But that's my problem. The big problem for all of us is that someone helped Marcus Fox return. We need to find Fox immediately. Kill him. Then find out which one of us helped him return. Please, look me in the eye and tell me it wasn't you. Why would I bring back Marcus Fox? FRANK: Money? Your brother? Payback on some Reverti? I don't need to know why. I just need to know. Was it you? All we've been through together, you have to ask me a question like that? It's because of all we've been through that I'm doing you the courtesy of asking. Was it you? No. It would've killed me, Rich. It would've killed me if you said "yes." Find out who did help Marcus return. What do you want me to do with this person when I find him? With that dumb son of a bitch, you can be as sloppy as you want. (MOBILE RINGING) JACK: Hello? Where are you? JACK: In the city. Researching for the book. Time got away from me. I figured I'd just stay here. You Okay? Am I okay? (SCOFFS) Yeah, I'm okay... Considering my wife asked for a separation. AMY: Where are you staying? Le Soleil. I wanted to see how the other half lives. What room are you in? What room? Um... (CHUCKLING) I don't... Um, the third floor, second door on the right out of the elevator. Look, I'm fine. I just didn't want you to worry about me. AMY: I'll always worry about you, Jack. One way or another. - I love you. -(HANGING UP) (MOBILE RINGING) Who is this? (STATIC CRACKLING) Who are you? Why did you call me the other day and warn me not to go into Anderson's house? WOMAN: (DISTORTED VOICE) I didn't warn you. I threatened you. Well, I'm threatening to tell the cops investigating Anderson's murder about your call. You know, I was just with him when he was killed. WOMAN: You're only alive because of your wife. What's her involvement with you? Tomorrow. 10:00 a.m. Pier nine. Pier nine? You'd prefer room 112 at the Pilgrim Motor Lodge? (LINE CLICKING) (INDISTINCT SHOUTING IN DISTANCE) (SHOUTING CONTINUING) (CAR ALARM BLARING) Check messages. AUTOMATED VOICE: There are no new messages. Call Gary Fischer. AUTOMATED VOICE: Calling Gary Fischer. (LINE RINGING) GARY: (ON VOICEMAIL) This is Gary. Leave a message. Gary, it's Jack. Where the hell are you? (GROANING) (LINE RINGING) WOMAN: Helm, Faulkner, and Ketteringham. Hi. Um, Gary Fischer, please. Mr. Fischer has not been with this firm for... Several months now. Oh. Uh... Okay. Thanks. The dead do come back to life, huh? (MOBILE RINGING) Where the hell have you been? GARY: Jack, you okay? No, Gary. I'm not okay. I have the feeling you've been lying to me this whole time. GARY: Jack, I haven't lied to you. But you haven't been completely truthful. You haven't told me everything you know about what's going on. Have you? GARY: Jack, please, look, I...(SIGHING) Okay, I'll tell you everything I know, but you have to come see me. I don't want to leave my room. Why not? GARY: Why not? Bill Anderson 's blood was sprayed over the garlic butter. (SIGHING) Where are you? Le Soleil. Le Soleil? GARY: Yeah. It's all connected, Jack. All right. Stay where you are. I'll be there later today. Qui Reverti? Miss Gilchrist sends her regards. That's her name, huh? A rose by any other name... Look. I don't know what all this is about. I don't really care. I just was worried about my wife. That she might be messed up in all this thing, whatever this is. I just wanted to make sure my wife was okay, and if she's become involved with your... Organization, if it was by choice. Either way... To keep her away from you. Chivalrous. So what's the answer? Ask her yourself, when you see her again. I'm gonna see her again? You'll see her again. But not in this lifetime. (BOTH GRUNTING) (GRUNTING) No! (GUNSHOT) (GROANING) If what they told us is true, Frank... This won't matter much. This is twice, right? We ever meet a third time, it's 'cause someone's told me to kill you. You got that? (PANTING) Come on, Marcus. I'm running out of snacks. (YELLING) Mom! Dad! MIKE: (ON TELEVISION) Get in the boat! MAN 2: Now, that's a fish, Mike. That's a fish! MIKE: That's a keeper. MAN 2: That's a big keeper. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) MADISON: Mom! Mom! Mom! (MADISON KNOCKING) Mom! (DOOR OPENING) You're not my dad. No. I'm afraid not. Is everything okay, sweetie? I thought I lived here. Oh! No. I'm sorry. I live here. So where's your parents? At our beach house at Finley Beach. LARRY: Wow! That's pretty far away. Oh, my God! (LIFT BELL DINGING) (MUFFLED FOOTFALLS) Gary, it's Jack. Why'd you run away? What are you hiding from? (DEADBOLT CLICKING) (DOOR CLOSING) You were fired from the law firm in Chicago. Months ago. You've done nothing but lie to me, Gary. What happened, man? Bill Anderson happened. And that machine he was working on. The "ghost machine"? It works. There we go. You need to ask more politely if you want to use my phone. Shut up! I need to call my parents right now! - You're still not asking. -I said, "Please!" Yeah, but it's not what you say, it's how you say it, and your tone is still quite rude. And you're not allowed to barge through my front door and just come into my house and start using my phone. (MOBILE VIBRATING) (SIGHING HEAVILY) - Hello? - LARRY: Give me the phone. - MADISON: Please, please! -(GASPS) Madison? Morn? Madison! Madis... Mom! Please help me. Please come and get me. Where are you? I don't know. I don't know! Where am I? Give me the phone. Hello? Who am I speaking to here? This is Alison O'Donnell. That was my daughter. Madison. She's... -Well, your daughter just barged through my front door without asking. She's been missing for a week! (ALISON SOBBING) Tell me, is she okay? She's, um, a little dirty, but she's fine and she's safe now, okay? Don't worry. ALISON: Who are you? Uh, where are you? (STAMMERING) My name's Larry Owens. I live in Seattle. Can I give you my address? It's 469 Connaught Street... ALISON: We're in Finley Beach. How did she get to Seattle? (DISTORTED VOICES) LARRY: Madison? Your mother wants to speak with you. LARRY: Hey! This used to be my home. I did used to live here. Really? Well, maybe that's why you came back. Actually, no, I don't think that's possible. We've only been here for a couple of years, but I don't think you're old enough to remember. You took out some of the crown molding. Yeah, just made the place look too... Hey, how did you know we did that? I wonder what they did with my knives... The bastards. Okay... Well, you'll be reunited with your parents soon enough, and meantime, I'll fix you a sandwich. No, I just need to freshen up a bit. You know... Shit, shower and shave. Do you have any idea what used to go on in this place? Before you lived here? Well, heard the rumors. And you're not afraid? What is there to be afraid of? Ghosts. (CHUCKLING) There's no such thing as ghosts. That's cute. (TELEPHONE RINGING) LARRY: Well, it's probably your mom calling you back. GARY: I'm gonna tell you this because I trust you, and hell, even if I didn't, you're the last stop. I'd been to Anderson's house before the fire. I wanted to see in person why Anderson wasn't cashing Cranfield's check. But when I got there, nobody answered. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (CLANGING) I could hear someone was there, though. So I went around the back. (LOW WHIRRING) There was this... Vibration. (LOUD RUMBLING) For no reason, I suddenly felt terrified and so sick. (GASPS INTENSELY) (RUMBLING CONTINUING) When it stopped... The feeling immediately went away. It had to have been that machine he was working on. The one he talked about last night! 19 hertz! And now I understand why he called it "the ghost machine"! See, I never did see Anderson. After I got sick, I figured, “To hell with this guy. "If he doesn't want Cranfield's money, screw him." I got on a plane, flew back home. It was good to be home. You know, I was in my place, with my wife, with my daughter, home. But then, in the middle of the night, I felt that same sickness come over me again. (PANTING) It was the after-effects of being exposed to that machine. Marcus... Marcus... Marcus. If you're not where you're supposed to be, where would you go? (SIGHING WEARILY) And what, exactly, do you think this "thing"... Was, is? Well, I didn't know then. But around that time, t started having trouble sleeping. So I would just sit in my daughter's nursery at night, just trying to piece this whole thing together, you know? (CHUCKLING) it wasn't my baby looking up at me any more. It was someone else. It was another soul. Jack... It was Donna. The girl from high school? Yes. The one who killed herself? GARY: She didn't kill herself! It was the other soul that was inside of her that did. Donna's suicide note. It's all in the third person. (SCOFFS) You think this is proof? A suicide note? Written by someone who was out of her mind? Donna is back. To warn me about them. MADISON: "In the beginning, there was death." Blah, blah, blah. I know this stupid book is trying to tell me something, but I'm having a hard time figuring out what. Well, it would make more sense if you were reading it when you were older, a little more in control. How did you know where to find me? One of the things the book strictly forbids is returning to your old life. People... Home. Punishable by preventing life after death forever. And then I realised, aren't you the kind of guy who does the exact opposite of what you're told? MADISON: No. I want to see Rose. That's not gonna happen. Well, I've figured out now how to make it happen. Always go for the weakest link. Marcus... You and I made a deal. You paid me a lot of money to shepherd you back after they killed you, and I kept my end. But... (SIGHING) This deal of ours, I didn't think all the way through. Not like I should have. (GASPS) Please don't hurt me. You're a grown-up and I'm just a kid! You're supposed to take care of me! Can I have a hug? Please? I'm scared! A hug would make me feel all better. Stay right there. Stay right there! (GRUNTING) (TIRES SQUEALING) (ENGINE STARTING) (BRAKES SCREECHING) (CAR DOOR ALERT CHIMING) Oh, come on! Your daughter, Emily, is how old? A year and a half? And you want me to believe that she is possessed by a girl we went to high school with? She's changed. She started behaving differently. Gary, she's a child! Children behave differently from one minute to the next. Coming from a guy who never had kids. Has Amy changed? In any way? (SIGHING) Yeah. She's not who she was. The way she wears her hair, the clothes she wears. Smoking. The music she listens to... The words she uses. Must be ever since she got mixed up with this... What is this, a...a cult? I've followed the paper trail as far as I could... Dug as deeply into Cranfield's interests as possible. I've connected her... All of them... To a group. I don't know how they all fit together, but they're all tied up with this "Psychomancy Trust." Todd Crane, Marcus Fox, Rose Gilchrist. Rose Gilchrist? What do you know about her? She sent someone to have me killed. Jeez, I'm just a lawyer, man. Just a goddamn lawyer! I didn't ask for this shit. Killing people? Calm down. Calm down? She stays at this hotel! Right across the hall! Wait. She's here? She's here now? I haven't seen her, but they say she's there. You think I can afford this place for three months? My credit cards are maxed to stay in this room! I'm drowning because of this. JACK: All right, take it easy. And tell me... You've investigated these people, right? Who are they? What do they want? What do they believe? What they believe is that every body, mine, yours, theirs, has two lives, whatever, two souls, inside of each body. Most of us will be born, live, die, without ever knowing. They think they can find the bodies they've come back in, and trigger them back into consciousness. Everyone has been here before. We'll all be back again in another body... But only they know how to control it. They keep that secret. I think it's what they believe. It's what we saw at Cranfield's. They go willingly into the next life. But for what they believe, it explains schizophrenia, addiction, why Mozart could write operas at four years old, a two-year-old having tantrums and nightmares. It's them... Trying to take over. JACK: All right, stop. You're starting to sound like one of Oz Turner's conspiracy theories. Joe Cranfield wanted Anderson to stop building that machine because it enables everyone to see the souls, the ghosts! Like I'm seeing Donna, Jack! Anderson's machine takes away their advantage. Cranfield is one. Donna had one, your wife is one! All right. Gary... You need to go home. I can't. Jack. My daughter, my little girl, Emily... ls one of them. I have no family. My wife has a restraining order on me. I don't blame her. I can't blame her. I... I picked up Emily. I was... I was so angry, I was so angry at Donna, at them... I didn't ask for this. I shook her. I hurt her. (SOBBING) I almost... -(CRYING) -JACK: Gary, Gary. Come on, come on. All right. Gary... Donna is gone. She's been gone a long time. Just like us being kids was... Was a lifetime ago, and it's never coming back. Get some sleep. (LIFT BELL DINGING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) We need to talk, Rose. BLANCHARD: Marcus Fox. I'd hoped you were dead. Frank told me about the side project you had him working on. I'm here to say I'm willing to continue where he left off. (BEEPING) WOMAN: In the beginning, there was death. RICHARD: It's him. ROSE: How does he look? Does he seem okay? (HANDLE RATTLING) (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) Ripped By mstoll Happy New Year 2015 - New Year, New Color ;-)
