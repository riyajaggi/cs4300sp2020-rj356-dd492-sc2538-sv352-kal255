 Long time, no see, Toddie. Do you go to school with my daughter, Meadow? Never met her. - Is that Meadow? -Yeah. Someone helped Marcus Fox return. Please look me in the eye and tell me it wasn't you. This guy knew what he was doing. Get down! It was like he couldn't care less. Rose asked me to find someone. REPORTER: It was Bix's acute addiction

 to prohibition liquor that allowed death to steal this legend from jazz fans forever. AMY: I know you weren't prepared to return like the Reverti are. We're a small minority of people who've returned and perfected returning for centuries. MANSON: I want to see Rose. That's not gonna happen. I've figured out now how to make it happen. Always go for the weakest link. What do they want? What do they believe? What they believe is that every body, mine, yours, theirs, has two lives,

 whatever, two souls. -(CRYING) - I took care of it. I had the body cremated. And, if you find him one day, you'll know that I left him there so that you can all be together again. Ripped By mstoll Happy New Year 2015 - New Year, New Color ;-) Are you all right? I have a couple things I need to ask you before I... Before I commit to a particular course of action. I have to know. Without the sales job, just tell me, do we live again? Are you sure there is another life after this one? How does the church know? What proof? And don't go tellin' me all that because Jesus rose from the dead thing, because... (CHUCKLES) He's Jesus and I'm just me. Does everybody come back? Or is it just him? Prove to me that it is possible. Is there such a thing as reincarnation? And how does it work? I mean, does God get revenge on people? I mean, if you do bad shit in this life, does, does he punish you by not being able to come back in the next? Or even in, in this life? What religion are you, anyway? What kind of church is this? Is this Catholic? Or Protestant? Because I don't see it. Karma. I don't buy it. But I see people who are just the worst pieces of shit, who lie and steal. Their lives just go on just fine. So, if I killed some men... Three men. Would God take it out on me by my wife leaving me and killing my kid? And can we really expect to see each other again in another life? Answer me that question! Right now! Look, I... I, I, I know you don't have the answer. But I do. I know the answer. And I know what I got to do. You know, I knew before I came in here. I just was hoping that you would give me a... A different answer, convince me otherwise. -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Amy! Amy, open the door! Get Amy. Or Rose. You have the wrong room. I don't know Amy. Step away from that door. Oh, I have the wrong room. Sir? I think you have the wrong hotel. -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Gary? Open the door. I made a mistake. I got the wrong room. My friend's in here. It's time to leave. Okay. I'm leaving. GARY: (ON VOICEMAIL) Hi. You've reached Julie, Gary, and... - EMILY: Emily! -(GARY LAUGHING) GARY: Leave a message. (VOICEMAIL BEEPS) (CLEARS THROAT) Hey, love. It's me. Uh, I just wanted to call and tell you, uh, I'm almost done here, and it'll all be over soon. Uh... I'm so sorry, Julie. I, I know you don't understand, but I hope you do know that, uh, I never asked for this. I just wanted to make it to go away. I never asked for this. Um... Tell Emily Daddy loves her. And he'll see her again. - Um... -(VOICEMAIL BEEPS) (SOBBING) Bye, Dad. Have a good day, sweetie. (DOOR OPENS) I'll get this when I get back from the gym. (DOOR CLOSES) (DOOR OPENS) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) What'd you forget this morning, Paige? Coming. Ahh! (GROANING) What did you do with my wife? Ahh! Nothing! No! Jack! Jack, listen! Listen! Nothing! Jack, no! (STUTTERING) No, listen to me. I'm not a part of them, Jack! I'm not a part of them! - She worked for you. -No! No, she didn't. She didn't. I just take their money. Okay? I'm a front for them. She works for Cranfield! You're both trustees... - No! No, no, no, no! -...for that building! No, Jack! Jack, Jack! I'm not a part of them, Jack! (GROANS) No! No! No! No! (SCREAMING) What did you do to Amy? Nothing! Nothing, Jack! (GRUNTING) It wasn't me! It was Rose who did it to Amy! Jack, Jack! Jack, no! No, no! (KNOCKING ON DOOR) GUARD: Mr Crane? Mr Crane! - Where is she? -GUARD: Mr Crane! Are you all right? - Where is she? -Tonight. At the building, they're putting Cranfield away! - GUARD: Come on! -She'll be there. - GUARD: Get off him! -(MUMBLES) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Good morning. Good morning. New page! My name's Madison. What's yours? Meadow. Hey! Hey. Is your dad Todd Crane? Yeah, why? Oh, nothing. My dad knows him. Whose class are you in? Oh, I just got here today. We moved from Portland. I need to go to the office and see what class I'm in. You think you could show me how to get there? Please? It's my first day and I don't know anybody. You don't want to be unfriendly, do you? We've got officers canvassing the neighbourhood. For who? Hmm? And don't water it down, because my daughter was just at a house where a man was murdered. We're looking for whoever killed Larry Owens. (SIGHS) I wanted to ask you about the man at your beach house, the one who identified himself as an FBI agent. Is this him? - No. -No. The man was much younger than that. SIMON: And he had, uh, this creepy coldness about him, like, uh, like he didn't care about anything. Okay. The office is over here. Does that door go outside? Yeah. I guess. I've got an idea. Let's go to the mall. I got some money. I did it all the time at my old school. Come on. Let's go. We'll be back in an hour. Wow! I've never done this before. -(DISTANT BUZZING) -(DOOR UNLOCKS) MAN: I went there. To the building. And I knocked and nobody was there. (STAMMERING) I knocked. (EXHALES) All right, but you need to help me. Only if you help me. He died before he was born. Who? Your son. Yes, thank you. Can you help me? No, I'm lost. It was supposed to be easier. Near the building? But I can't find my way over. I'm sure if you keep looking, you'll find it. (SNICKERING) I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to your son. He's right next to you. Oh. yeah? What's his name? He doesn't have one where he is. (SIGHS) Says he'll wait for you there. And he'll wait for Amy. But not for Rose. GUARD: Whelan. Let's go. How do you know those names? - Was I talking in my sleep? -GUARD: Whelan. I said let's go. (JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) Everything will become clear to you soon enough. The headaches and the confusion, they'll all pass. But can I just have a small shot, to get through this pain? Can I just have a small sip, Rose? I know it will help. Just until the pain goes away and... No more after this. Baby. You don't need it any more. This is a new life. It's a fresh start for you. For us. You again? You can't keep out of trouble? I need your help. I got to get out of here by tonight. It's not me that needs the help. It's my wife. She's, uh, she's been caught up in this, um, this group, a cult, or, or whatever. They call themselves Qui Reverti. And they've, uh, they've brainwashed her into thinking she's somebody else. And, uh, I can't find her. But they're the ones responsible for the Anderson killings. You don't need my help, Whelan. You should find yourself a shrink. The body you fished out of the harbour? Pier nine? Two gunshot wounds, right forearm was punctured. The guy that killed him is the same guy that shot Anderson. He used the same gun. .45 double-barrelled pistol. You can check with ballistics. The gunman is Reverti. I've seen him talking to my wife. Where? Le Soleil hotel. She's not there any more. I thought, I thought Crane would know where she was. The guy you knocked around this morning? (SIGHING) He's a trustee of an old office building downtown, along with my wife and some guy called, um... Marcus Fox. They're due to meet there this evening. What do you know about Marcus Fox? Fox is a cold case of mine. A homicide just occurred at Fox's former residence. It displayed some signatures matching the old case. Were they bound? With their hands and knees up against their chests? Go. You suck at this! You so lied to me. You said we were going to the mall and now I'm gonna get in so much trouble. You won't get in trouble. You're already in trouble. Has this happened before? A person having such difficulty returning? I've seen it before. Is it because he's not initiated Reverti? No. You, you gave him the trigger. He was triggered by it. Could it be because Bix's body wasn't bound at burial? (CHUCKLES) Binding the body is not required for return. It's just ceremonial. You know this. What? All right, tell me the truth, Richard. Be honest with me. Is this you? You don't trust me? I see a pattern. You didn't trigger me because you were in love with Amy, and I lost nine years of my life. You know what you did. And I think that you purposely failed triggering Bix. And now they just fished Frank's body out of Lake Washington with two bullet holes to the chest. Well, I'm not the only Shepherd who uses double-barrelled. I loved Frank. I know you did. And that is why the only reason you had for killing him was that he knew that it was you that brought back Marcus Fox. You did what you needed to do for yourself. (SCOFFS) I planned to find Marcus and bring him back as a child and kill him before he had the ability to do any harm, but when it came to it, I couldn't, I couldn't see Marcus behind the 9-year-old girl pleading for her mom. Marcus is too strong. That sweet 9-year-old is already gone. And if you're going to activate a child, pick a kid nobody cares about. The world is full of them. Jack Whelan cared about his unborn child. His wife's 5-month unborn. But that had to be done, right? So now have I become something that has to be done? Are you gonna send Shepherds to assassinate me tonight? Is that what you're saying, Rose? Should I be expecting this? Fix this. You find Marcus and you kill Marcus. (INHALING DEEPLY) (DOORBELL RINGS) Who is it? (DOORBELL RINGS) Who is it? Richard Shepherd. (SIGHS) RICHARD: Open the door, Todd. Ooh. Look at you. - What are you doing here? -Heard Whelan was arrested. You're, uh, feeling the need to further heighten your sense of paranoia? -(DOOR CLOSES) -Jack Whelan do that to you? Freakin' psycho. I didn't ask for this. Thank God, I was alone. You know what? Let me tend to that for you. We Shepherds are, uh, experienced in the field. So what did he want? Whelan. To talk to Rose. They all want to talk to Rose. Whelan. Marcus Fox. I don't like how I'm involved, Richard. I want to get out of all of this. You know that... A front for that crappy building, Reverti pays me. I don't even want to do that any more. I mean, how many times do I have to say it? What makes you say that Marcus Fox is back? He's been dead nine years, right? Right. But someone brought him back. -(GASPS) -Shh, shh, shh. -(GROANING) -Hold still-. -(GROAN me) -(SIGHS) I don't know. I think you're wrong about Marcus being back, aren't you? Hmm? Aren't you? (GRUNTING) No! No! It was a Shepherd who brought him back! Why would you say such a thing? Todd? - Huh? -(GRUNTING) (SCREAMING) - Why? -(SCREAMING) Nine years ago, I... Nine years ago, I facilitated a cash withdrawal for Fox. A month later, he disappeared! He paid someone! He could've run away with it. And leave six million in the bank? Six million? (CHUCKLES) Then he must've died! No! No! There was activity in the account after he died. (GASPING) It was you! (INHALES AND EXHALES DEEPLY) You brought Marcus back! Richard, Richard, listen to me, please! Please, I can, I can help you, Richard. I can cover for you. They'll trust me. I'm their lawyer. Please! - You wanna work for me, now? -Yes! (SOBBING) Yes. You put one foot wrong, you know what happens? Yes! (SOBBING) Drop the charges against Jack Whelan. The Reverti don't want the attention. (DOOR OPENS) BLANCHARD: Mr. Fox, I want you to understand that, although you've been brought in for questioning, you are not under arrest, nor have charges been filed, and in either case, you have the right to have an attorney present. MARCUS: Yes. Yes. I understand. I can actually help you. I'm a bit of a historian. Let me tell you about the axe murders. These murders took place on June 9, 1912, in Villisca, Iowa. Eight victims, six of them children, heads bludgeoned with an axe. The crime remains unsolved. I know it was the gardener. Eliot Johnston, that time. Or you know an interesting one? The Music Murderer, that was my nickname. My nickname for the crimes. They started in Baden bei Wien, 1791. The Kapellmeister's daughters, too young to go inside, were behind the chapel, hoping to hear the music through the walls. Ave Verum Corpus. The premiere. A member of the orchestra, he knew the local girls, offered to take them inside, introduce them to Herr Mozart. They were so excited. They all went 'round to the back alley. Cobblestones. The stone walls surrounding the buildings just killed any sound. The alley was no more than six feet across. The killer first slit the throat of the older Fraulein, telling the other girl he would do the same to her if she screamed. He said, "I'm sorry, "but you won't get to meet Herr Mozart. "But I can give you a preview of his latest opera "while I rape and strangle you." They found the bodies, bound tight, wrapped in cloth. Fox went on like that for over an hour. Detailing serial killings over the centuries. Marcus Fox was my first case. And since, I've, uh, arrested 30 suspects that led to convictions and half a dozen cases remain open. But it's this one. It's Marcus Fox that stops me from going to church on Sundays. He escaped his house just before we found 20 bodies bound in his basement, and then, nothing from him in over nine years. I figured he was in jail in some other state, or, more likely, dead. Till today. Who was the victim? The guy currently living there. Who found him? A young couple from Oregon. Their 9-year-old daughter had been missing, received a call from her at this location, and when they show up, all they find is a dead guy's body. (PHONE VIBRATES) Yeah? Okay. Crane dropped the charges. You can go. Who's that? The parents of the missing girl just described him to our sketch artist. He's been passing himself off as an FBI agent, looking for the girl. That's the guy that shot Anderson. -(LOCKS DOOR) -(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING) (GUARD TALKING INDISTINCTLY) GUARD: No. Can I help you? I was, I was in here earlier. There was a guy. Right there, he was talking to himself. There are guys coming in and out of here all day. I barely remember you. MAN: (ON PHONE) Yeah, well can I speak to someone else then? No, they're all at lunch right now. How about the prosecutor? No, 'cause, uh, the court's closed. - Okay, I'll call back later. - All right. (MOBILE RINGS) Hey, honey. MADISON: Hello, Toddie. Listen to me. MADISON: Speak! MEADOW: Daddy! Daddy, I'm scared. Meadow! Meadow, listen... MADISON: I'm your daddy now. I want to talk to Rose. I'm sure you get the rest. Burnell Lytton building. 9:00 p.m. She'll be there. MADISON: So will we. (MOBILE CLICKS) (MOBILE BEEPS) My head, the left side hurts so much, it's burning. It's all part of coming back. I hear music all the time. Notes and sounds, just constantly. Right. That's because you were brilliant. You played this with the Paul Whiteman orchestra. It's like. One self is far away, almost asleep. But a self that I used to know from a long time ago is here too. Yes. Exactly. That's right. I feel achy. Nauseous. I'm itchy on the inside. Me, Bix... I'm not happy. Out of all my lives, you are the one I returned for, and now you're back. Only because you made me come back! We were in love. I believe you. Then fight to be with me again. Just because you can live again doesn't mean you should. FRANK: Someone helped Marcus Fox return. Was it you? No. That would've killed me, Rich. (EXHALES HEAVILY) I'm sorry, I'm... Sorry I haven't been here for a while. You look good, though. You look good. Yeah, it's, um... It has been hard to get away lately. I've painted myself into a bit of a corner. Just like Mom would say Dad always did? (CHUCKLES) Must be genetic. But, um. This corner, I may not be able to contort myself out of this time. I took money from a bad man. Evil, really. If I ever met an evil man, it's him. I wanted to get out. Away from Reverti. I wanted to take care of you and another person, but... (SIGHS) Like I said, now I might be killed for it. It's closing in on me. (SIGHS) (CHUCKLES) I'm sorry. It's just my intentions were about as good as they've always been. When we were kids and we used to play, whatever, and you'd say, "You wanna be the good guy or the bad guy?“ And I'd always want to be the good guy. And somewhere in the middle of the game, I'd just turn bad and you would get so mad, and I would say "I'm sorry, Jim, I tried to be good, "but I'm just bad, and you can't help being good." Now look. Where'd that get you? Or me? There's no such thing as karma. I'm more sure of it now than ever. Lifetime after lifetime. You're not paid for good. I spend all my days trying to undo what's been done, resetting the dice for everyone else, and when I try to do something for good... Here I am. Taking is just so easy. It feels like luck. It's hard to say goodbye. But we'll see each other next time around. You can go now, Jim. I may not be here to see you or take care of you. You're wasting your time staying alive. Hmm? Start over. Next time, I'll be the good guy. I hope you'll be proud of me when you see me again, wherever you are in there. I love you. And I know that you love me. Don't be afraid. Hmm? Because, in the beginning, there was death. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Close the door, will you? I don't want the people across the hall to see in. You know the guy who stays here? Not really. You seen him lately? Was he, was he with anyone, or... He hasn't checked out because, uh... Uh, I need to talk to him, and... He's not answering his, his phone. Ow! Ow! Meadow? Daddy! Daddy! MADISON: Shut up! It's okay, sweetie. She's not gonna hurt you. - Open the damn door, Toddie. -Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. (DOOR OPENS) No! Gary! No! Wait! No! (GRUNTING) Daddy! - Listen, Marcus. -No one's here! Where are they? Cranfield's not getting interred till 9:00! They're not here yet! (BREATH TREMBLING) - Gary! -Stay back! No, no, no! No, Gary, not like this! I mean it! Don't come any closer. This is not the way to end this! (BREATH TREMBLING) - Oh! Oh, okay, okay! -Get back, Toddie! All right, all right, all right. Gary! You were right! You were right about them. I'm here, I'm here because you're right. No, I'm done. They win this round. But it's all right here, Jack. Information on what I found out about Qui Reverti. The cops will see it. Everyone will know. Oh, no, no! They will have won! You'll be dead! Look, Marcus. They gave you keys when they triggered you. Come on, man! You're the guy who picked up the fight! The fight is fixed! We can't beat them. Reverti's rigged the game. The only game that there really is is totally in their favour, and they're never gonna let any outsiders occupy their secret with them. Okay. Oz Turner and Bill Anderson, they died fighting! You're quitting, to leave me to go it alone? I ain't quitting! I owe it to Amy! And you owe it to Emily to not give up until we have taken them down, or until Reverti kills us. - Just stay there, Meadow. Just stay there. -Daddy. You're doing fine, sweetie. - Hurry up, Toddie. -Okay, okay. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going. Just... ...just wait. Come on. I mean, you good? You good with Emily thinking that her dad quit on her? Emily is not my daughter any more, Jack. Donna took her. I lost my little girl. - I lost her. -No. Okay. Now look, I've done everything you've asked. - Please, just let Meadow go. -Daddy! She's with me till I see Rose. Okay. Okay! Okay. Go, Meadow! Go! (GRUNTING) -(SCREAMING) -MEADOW: Daddy! No! It is her! It is Emily! Donna is dead! I mean, you good? You good with Emily thinking that her dad quit on her? Show her that you loved her! Show her that you fought them! You're gonna go in there with me, and when I'm in there, I'm gonna get Amy, I'm gonna take her out of there, I'm gonna her away from them. And while I'm in there, I'm gonna, I'm gonna destroy, man, I'm gonna break shit up. We are not finished! They are! (SCREAMING) MEADOW: Daddy! No! Go! Run! You stay the hell away from my daughter! (MEADOW SOBBING) -(KNIFE SLASHING) -(SCREAMS) (TODD SCREAMING) (GROANING) Give me your hand. Give me your hand! We're gonna go in there together. Jack, I am gonna fight for her. I am. She'll know that I did. But the only way we beat them is from the other side. No! No! (GLASS SHATTERING) (CROWD APPLAUDING) AMY: A good man is hard to find. He was taken from me much too young. It's a symbol of a person I was and can be again. You and me have something in common. We do, huh? Rose ruined both of our lives. Richard! Hurry! Amy, I'm taking you home where you belong. This is where I belong! Get out! - Get away from her! -RICHARD: Put the gun down, Whelan! I will shoot! (BREATHING HEAVILY) Ripped By mstoll Happy New Year 2015 - New Year, New Color ;-)
