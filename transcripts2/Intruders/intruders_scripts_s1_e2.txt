 JACK: I thought you hated jazz. I guess the music just took me away. Bye. AMY: Because in the beginning, there was death. No! (GASPING) Last three weeks, I have been telling you about Bill Anderson. Judy and son, Matt, lost their lives when they tried to keep this from us.

 Ripped By mstoll Happy New Year 2015 - New Year, New Color ;-) (GASPING) MAN: (ON PA) Could I have your attention, please? Train number 85 will be ready for boarding shortly. Passengers with small children, passengers needing assistance are requested to identify themselves. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) Welcome back. MADISON: "In the beginning there was death." (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (SIGHS) (ELEVATOR DINGS) (CHUCKLES) RECEPTIONIST: (OVER PHONE) Kerry, Crane, and Hardy. Oh, hi. Um, Amy Whelan, please? Are you expected? Yeah. Well, no. Maybe, but probably not, but I'm, uh, Jack Whelan. I'm her husband. Have a seat, please. - Okay. -(CALL DISCONNECTS) Hello? Oh. JACK: Amy. Your hero's here. I'll, uh... I'll just drop this off and be out of here. Follow me. Mr. Crane? Jack. Brother man. It's been awhile. Todd Crane. Yeah. I know, I know. Good to see you, Todd. So, how can I help you out? Well, um... I have a lunch in the city, and, uh, Amy managed to forget her phone last night. Sol... I thought I'd get it back to her, and, uh... So I just need to know where she is. Uh... I don't know. Um, the thing is, Amy's not in Seattle this week. At least, not with us. Oh. So, she hasn't dropped by yet? No. She's staying with some friends, and she said she might drop in the office. I thought I'd catch her, but, obviously, she hasn't, so... Right. Well, listen, if that's the case, you can leave the phone with me, and I'll get it to her when I see her. No, that's all right. Thanks, Todd. I'll, uh... I'll make sure she gets it. Is there something I should know, Jack? About what? Amy. No. Anything I should know, Todd? (CHUCKLES) I will tell Amy that you were here. If I see her, or she calls. Daniella? Could you walk Jack out, please? No, no, that's all right. That's fine. I, uh, I wasted enough of your time already. I'll see myself out, thanks. (ELEVATOR DINGS) (BEEPS) (BEEPING) (AMY MOANING) - Amy, Amy, Amy... -No, no, no. Amy, wake up. You're having a bad dream. (AMY SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Amy, you're freaking me out. Wake up. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) (CLEARS THROAT) Honey? (AMY WHISPERING IN RUSSIAN) JACK: Amy. Amy, wake up. You're dreaming. - Come on, baby. Wake up. -(MUTTERING) Hey. Hey. Hey. You Okay? Are you all right? Yes. Amy's all right. Because in the beginning there was death. (MOBILE RINGING) (VOICE MESSAGE) Hey, Jack. It's Brud. When are you coming back with my car? Give me a call. (SIGHS) (MOBILE CHIMING) (AMY CHUCKLING) (JACK CHUCKLES) Did it work? No, please. I... I live... Let me ask you about your husband... Simon, you said? Recently separated? I'm Simon O'Donnell, Madison's father. Mr. O'Donnell, would you wait outside... - No! Oh, Simon! -...for just another minute? (ALISON CRYING) TIM: Greetings to true soldiers of truth. This is Tim Truth on the Oz Turner Pirate Radio Hour and Podcast, filling in for Oz Turner. Officially. (CHUCKLES) "Officially," the Oz Turner death is being ruled a "suicide". It... It's an absurdity on par with the Warren Commission. I suppose it's, what, just a coincidence that Oz Turner is eternally silenced after talking about the murder of Bill Anderson's wife, and his son, and the destruction of Bill Anderson's laboratory. If you're out there right now, listening, Mr. Anderson, we are all here to make sure that you evade capture, my brother. And I suppose it's just a coincidence that Oz Turner is found dead just days after revealing the name of, until then, a secret society, we now know as Qui Reverti! Professor Perdu used to say that coincidence is a coward's rationale. You know, I am in fear of those that assassinated Oz! They are out there listening! They are putting their crosshairs on me. But I want those killers to know one thing, that I, and every loyal listener, we are disciples of Oz Turner. We will never forget. Just sayin'. So they won't release an AMBER Alert unless there's... ...definitive proof she's been abducted. (SIGHS) It's just not Madison. It's not our daughter to just walk off. (SIGHS) Yeah, well, maybe she went looking to find out what happened to her parents. (CRYING) We'll find her, okay? Hi. Are you with the police? No, Special Agent Shepherd. The FBI? The sheriffs didn't say the FBI would be involved. The sheriffs? No, no, no. I will find her, and I will bring her back from where she came. Happily ever after. Uh, yeah. RICHARD: When was the last time you saw her? SIMON: Early afternoon, yesterday. I believe you were not here? No, I was... Where were you? Uh... This is the family beach house, and Madison and I came here for a couple of days. I was in Portland. Problems? We had an argument. It happens. Any friends live nearby? Relatives? Any places she liked to spend alone? No. (SNIFFLES) Like I said, our family comes here to get away. Our friends come here, but anyone we know in Finley Beach won't be there until the summer. Before she left, did Madison ever display any unusual behaviour? No. Well, not very unusual. She had a... A nightmare. Sleepwalk? - No. -No? Has she recently displayed any gestures, mannerisms, tics, not seen before? She, um... She moaned, kind of. She ever speak in a foreign language she never learnt? Ever say that she had to go to Portland to visit a Mrs. Ng in Chinatown? What the hell kind of question is that? She ever use any coarse language, threats, cautioned you that "What goes around comes around?" Uh, okay, um... You know, it occurs to me, Agent Shepherd, that we never asked you for any identification. I would really like to see some now. Well, I know who I am, Alison. You know who you are? Okay, you know what? You come in here and you take advantage of our emotional state and you get yourself off, or whatever your sick shit is. You get the hell out of here, man! Madison ever met Nick Golson? I'm so sorry, Simon. Your suspicions were right on the money. The man your wife has been sleeping with, repeatedly, is Nick Golson. Oh. Alison? (GASPS) Oh, Jesus Christ. No. How did you know? In a case like this, we have to consider every possibility, Alison. Maybe Nick Golson wanted Madison to be his daughter. Oh! (CRYING) Simon! (MOBILE RINGING) Amy? Amy, where are you? I'm in Seattle. MAN: (VOICE DISTORTED) We know where you are. Go home. Even if you find Amy, she's gone. (CALL DISCONNECTS) What? Hello? Hello? (ENGINE STARTS) (SIGHS) Hey, man. - Excuse me? -Hmm? You know a guy called George something? - Nah. No. -You don't know? Thanks for your help, man. You recognise this girl? - You know a guy called George? -No. Thanks. Hey, man. Can you help me? I'm trying to find my wife. One of you guys picked her up the night before last. She lost her phone. His name was George... DRIVER: I don't have time for this, man. Damn it. DISPATCHER: (OVER RADIO) Job number 35451A for an Arthur Jones. Pick him up at 263, Glenview, drop off at 566, Oakdale. MAN: Roger that. George Brackett? Anyone with a 20 on George Brackett? George here. Just a heads-up for you, a couple of drivers over by Le Soleil wanna pass along that there's a guy asking around about a driver who found his wife's cell phone. Kovak thought it might be you, and Sigolov says he sees that guy hanging out at Pluto's bar. Copy that. (MOBILE RINGING) Amy Whelan. Hear you're looking for me. You the cab driver? You got the phone, I got the money. What else you need from me? She's missing. You're the last person to see her. She got out of my cab. Twenty people do it a day. Yeah, and I guess if I were you, I would've thrown the damn thing out the window. Just trying to do the right thing. And you did. You did. Thank you. I didn't mean to insult your good intentions, thanks. Not a cop? (CHUCKLES) I was a Los Angeles cop. - Was. -And your wife, she's really missing? Yeah. She's all I got, man. That, I do understand. My wife, she took off last year. I'm sorry. That's her? Hard to tell, man. She's pretty short. 5'4". Not her, then. The woman with the phone was pretty tall. That's her. Jack Whelan. George Brackett. Get you a beer, George? - Sure. -Two beers. Thanks. You know, Jack, I do remember your wife, and she creeped me out. What? Amy? (LAUGHS) She's a lawyer from LA. Her clients may be creepy, but not her. - Thanks. -Thank you. I overheard her on the phone. She said she lived in Russia. (CHUCKLES) No. No, she's never lived there. Uh... You must have misunderstood, or she'd had a few, and she was clowning around. She said she was with the Czar's secret police. And that she assassinated a labor strike leader. In 1883. (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Have your boarding pass and identification out when you get to the train. MANSON: "Welcome back. "You have been missed. "But now, your river flows again. "Although you have traveled "from here to there many times, "do not be afraid of uncertainty. â€œHeadaches, unfamiliar memories, "you've had these before, and you'll have them again. "This book begins aty the point you began before "in another life. "Only Qui Reverti can understand. "There is a lie they tell. MANSON: "A lie that is..." MARCUS: A lie that is believed MARCUS: for the sake of control that life, a single life, is to be lived in quiet terror because all they have seen is that death awaits them. Death awaits us all. People believe because they have been told that death is what God has designed, that God is a punishing God, who hates us, destroys us. People believe death to be his final punishment, at the end of our short spans of bloody sorrow. That this book is in your hands proves death is not punishment. There is no such thing. TICKET AGENT: Next. Accompanying adult? I'm traveling alone. No, you're not. Step aside, please. - But... -I said step aside, little lady. Let me attend to these other passengers. But this is my train. No, it's not. There's no train for you without an accompanying adult. And there is no Department of Transportation regulations concerning travel by unaccompanied minors. The train company that this ticket represents insists that children ages five through 16, who are traveling alone, travel pursuant to special "unaccompanied minor" procedures. But I didn't know. Sorry, kid. No, you're not. You're not sorry, but you will be. Asshole! What goes around comes around. (CRACKING) (PIPE CLANGS) (SPEAKING CANTONESE) (SPEAKING CANTONESE) (GASPS) (SPEAKING CANTONESE) (RICHARD YELLS) (WHIMPERS) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (MRS. NG WHIMPERING) (SPEAKING CANTONESE) Closer than you think. Picked her up at Spinasse, dropped her off around here. This block. Big tipper, that's how I remembered. Yeah, that's her. - Around here? -Yep. JACK: Well, that's her office building, but Crane said she wasn't here this week, though. Maybe she went back to the office to pick something up after dinner? Why wouldn't they have me drop them at the front entrance to go inside? Whoa. Whoa! "They?" Look, I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want you to go there, but there was a guy with her. They just seemed like friends. All right. (EXHALES) All right. Um... This the guy? That picture sucks, man. All right. (INHALES) Where's the nearest nice hotel? Hey. Hey! Pull over. Pull over! Pull over! GEORGE: All right. That building right there. Yeah. - What is it? -Condo. Well, maybe she was going there, and had you drop her a couple blocks away so... She could see if anyone was watching her go in. That's not so good, man. Hey. Seattle? Uh-huh. Yeah. I need to get to Seattle, too. Thing is, I need some help. Can you pass yourself off as my dad to that douchebag over there? Hmm? Right. Nice try. See ya, kid. (SIGHS) RICHARD: FBI, I'm looking for a little girl named Madison O'Donnell. I don't know. I turned her away and she walked away. (CAR DOOR SHUTS) I need to get to Seattle. Hmm? Doorman, not letting anyone in. Let me get a Google image and you can tell me if it was the same guy you saw in the cab. Is this the guy? Is that him? Okay, uh... Let's walk. - Who's this? -lt's all right. Just walk. What's going on? Okay. Now, run. Run! (GRUNTING) Hey! GEORGE: Oh! (BOTH GRUNTING) (JACK GROANS) (GROANS) MAN: No! She said no! (GEORGE GROANING) Hey, man. Come on. You all right? You Okay? Who the hell were those guys? You're asking me? Those guys were after you. Who's your wife? Who are you? - George... -No, don't. Don't answer, man. Don't answer. I don't wanna know. Hey. Hey, come on. - No! I'm done! -l'm sorry. God! (MOBILE RINGING) Damn it. Oh. jeez! God damn it. Yeah? Jack, it's Brud. Yeah, hi. Hi, Brud. Are you still in Seattle? - Yeah. - You were gonna call. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, man. My car, is it okay? Yes, the car is okay. Are you okay? Yes, I am okay. We're worried about you. I know, I'm sorry. We were gonna report you missing. Yeah. I... I knew you would be about to call the police out looking for me. That's why I answered the phone. Okay, all right. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Um, I am not in Seattle for whatever reason I gave you. (SIGHS) Uh... Amy went missing here. She went missing. I had her phone, and I... I couldn't contact her, and I tried to find her, and I... I couldn't... I can't find her, Brud. So that's why I'm here. Amy is missing. I'm sorry I lied to you. (PANTING) (CALL DISCONNECTS) Hello? Brud? WOMAN: (OVER PHONE) Jack? Jack, can you hear me? Amy? Amy? Where are you? Home, just like I said I would be. Where are you? I... MARCUS: We do die, but we can return. The few, the very few, those who possessed the will and strength of purpose. The self-chosen ones. Qui Reverti. This book will guide you through the prison doors, back to freedom. Welcome back, Reverti. Welcome back, again. (GRUNTS) Are you running away? You talk too much. There's a group of people who I believe may have killed Bill Anderson's family, and they're still trying to kill him. What you're proposing, Mr. Fox, -risks many lives. -MARCUS: No, no. How many times do I have to tell you? Call me Marcus. Jack, I want to separate. (AMY GASPS) MARCUS: Shepherd. What goes around comes around.
