 JACK: I'm trying to find my wife. One of your guys picked her up the night before last. She lost her phone. His name was George something. - DRIVER: I don't have time for this, man. - (TIRES SCREECHING) You're the last person to see her. She got out of my cab. Twenty people do it a day. I'm traveling alone. No, you're not. Step aside, please.

 Asshole. What goes around comes around. (SPEAKING CANTONESE) (SHOUTS IN PROTEST) (SHOTS BLASTING) -(COCKS GUN) -No! She said no. Where's your wife? I need to get to Seattle. TIM TRUTH ON RADIO: There is no such thing as death. As long as, together, we carry on the fight for Bill Anderson and Oz Turner. The ones we are up against, my soldiers,

 butchered Anderson's wife, they shot his son, set his home on fire... Weirdos. (SCANNING STATIONS) (SCANNING AND CRACKLING) (GENTLE CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS) (SIGHS HEAVILY) You know... You can use my cell if you want to call your mum. You like your mum and dad? (LAUGHTER ECHOES DISTANTLY) Daddy! MUM: Okay, my turn. Oh! (LAUGHTER ECHOES) I don't... I don't know. (SIGHS HEAVILY) I think I did the wrong thing, Madison. And I think you did, too. You didn't tell me the truth, did you? Are you running away? And... Where'd you get all that money from? You talk too much. (SIGHS) I'm such a creep for being so greedy. I wasn't thinking. (KAREN SIGHS) Okay, I think it's best if I just turn around and take you back home, so tell me where your mum is at. (SIGHS) (TURNS OFF CLASSICAL MUSIC) (MENACINGLY) Put it back. (TURNS CLASSICAL MUSIC BACK ON) (SIGHS IN DELIGHT) Ave Verum Corpus. Mozart composed it for the parish of Baden Bei Wien for the Feast of Corpus Christi. Four-voice choir. Strings. Continuo. His manuscript contained few directions. There... That phrase... (CHOIR SINGS SOFT NOTE) It returns to D minor, resting on the dominant via two diminished seventh chords accompanying the word sanguine. First performed May 29th, 1791. The premiere was marred that night by the discovery of the Kapellmeister's daughter, who was found murdered behind the parish church, the third victim of a killer of young girls, who was never found. (CHUCKLES IN SHOCK) How did you know all that? You do a report in school or something? I was there that night. I played in the orchestra. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) Ripped By mstoll Happy New Year 2015 - New Year, New Color ;-) (BABY WON'T YOU PLEASE COME HOME BY BIX BEIDERBECKE PLAYS) (MODERN ROCK SONG INTRUDES AND OVERLAPS) (SWITCHES BACK TO BIX BEIDERBECKE) In the beginning, there was death. (TURNS OFF SONG) (SCANNING RADIO STATIONS) (TIME HAS COME TODAY BY THE RAMONES PLAYING) (SONG RESTARTS ON 45 RECORD) MARCUS: (ECHOES) I'd say thanks for taking me up on the offer to meet, Richard, but I know the real reason you're here. I knew it. Cranfield finally convinced the nine to kill me off, once and for all. I guess you'd learn something about someone after a few thousand years. But, even in a few years, I know something about you, too, Richie. Why should they make the rules? Hmm? Why not make a buck off your rebellious streak? Today, we both walk out of here. You tell them you're still looking for me. When the nine do manage to kill me, you walk off with that shitload of money, then... Shepherd me, off the books. When it's time, bring me back. And when I'm back, they'll never see me comin'. I'll take over, and not forget what you did for me. Richard. What you're proposing, Mr. Fox, risks many lives. No, no. How many times do I have to tell you? Call me Marcus. And what I'm asking you to do doesn't risk many lives. It risks them all. (CHUCKLES) Shepherd... Just remember, what goes around comes around. (TIME HAS COME TODAY BY THE RAMONES CONTINUES) (DOG BARKS) (GUN COCKS) Hey. Bobbi? It's me, it's Jack. I'm just returning your car. Welcome back. Thanks. (WHISPERING) Hey... It's just me. (GROANS SLEEPILY) You're in bed early. When did you get back? Yesterday. Like I said I would. How come you didn't call and tell me you'd lost your phone? Jack... What's that? It's nothing. Nothing. I... I got into a thing in a bar. There's no harm done. No harm done? Look at you. I mean, a fight? What is that? You haven't been in a fight in years. You've been doing so well. I got wound up. A guy started some shit. Forget it. I want to know why you didn't call and tell me you'd lost your phone. I just couldn't remember your number. I mean, I usually just hit speed dial. (SCOFFS) Come on... No, really. I mean, can you remember mine? 3-6-0... Uh... It has a 7 and a 9 in it, I'm pretty sure. No cheating, come on. What's my number, right now. All right, I can't do it. (CHUCKLES) The cab driver calls and says he found your phone, so I call the hotel you usually stay at, and you're not there. You never checked in. Yeah, we talked about me interviewing with other firms. I didn't want Todd Crane to find out. Le Soleil is like the KHC dormitory. I would probably run into a bunch of people I knew. There was a post-it that said "Le Soleil Hotel" on your computer. Right, that was another client for the Seattle city lights account, completely unrelated to this trip. You should know I stopped by your office. I talked to Todd Crane. What? Jack, why? Because I couldn't find you anywhere. Don't worry. I told him you were visiting some friends, just covering all the bases. It's no big deal, but you should know. We talked last month, in there, on the bed, about this, about me switching firms. Now, if this had been about you, Jack, about your book, or whatever, you would have remembered. But not when it comes to Amy, not when it comes to me. I'm sorry, honey, I just... I wasn't... Hey, what the hell are you doing? You know what this poison did to you! That wasn't the reason for the fight, Am. It wasn't that! I was worried about you! I was... I was worried for me without you. I love that you went looking. God... I'm really very sorry that I didn't call. Time away from home is different, and I just really figured you'd assume I was okay. That is not the world I live in since... You know. I do know, and I'm sorry. Hey... ls there anything going on? Anything we need to talk about? You know, after all these years. After everything we've been through, there is nothing you could do, in this or any lifetime, that I would not forgive. So, if you need help, or you got yourself into something, just tell me. All you need to know is that I would never leave you. I need you. You're my shepherd. Honey, there are things that you wouldn't, that you couldn't understand. I mean, I don't think that anyone could, but I just want to... (AMY SIGHS HEAVILY) What? Am, what? What now? Amy! (OLD TIME JAZZ PLAYS LOUDLY) (SIGHS HEAVILY) Oh, shit... (SNORING) (UNUSED COIN DROPS INTO SLOT) (SCREAMS) (MUTTERING) I'm so stupid. (MOBILE PHONE BUZZES) Yeah? (CONNECTION BREAKING UP) Yeah, I'm calling because I found this girl and I found your number on the back of a card... Could you say that again? The signal is bad. I said, I found your number on the back of a card, and from this card, I'm hoping that you know her, so I can take her back home... Her name is Madison O'Donnell. Hello? Madison O'Donnell. Where are you? Shelter Creek safety rest stop. Where are you? Shelter Creek safety rest stop. It's about... An exit past the 504 to Mount St. Helens... Who the hell are you talking to? Uh... Um... (STAMMERS) My cell phone battery died, and I had to tell my boyfriend. MANSON: Hang it up. I just don't want him to get freaked out and worry. Hang it up now! I gotta take a leak. Well, I think you're old enough to go do that on your... Hang up the goddamn phone! - Hey, what are you... -Give me the phone. (GASPING IN SHOCK) (SIGHS) Karen... Karen, I'm sorry, but that man you called on that card is my uncle, my Uncle Marcus. He touched me and other kids I know, over and over. Karen, they were afraid to tell on him, but I wasn't. I did. But they don't believe me! They say I'm lying. They believe him! Yes, I stole money from my parents, and I ran away. I couldn't tell you all that. I'm sorry. Did you tell him where I am? (GROANING) Oh... Yeah. Can I go get my stuff out of your car? I have to go. He can't find me. Hey, wait, wait, wait. I, uh... Look, we're only an hour away, so... Were you lying when you said you had to use the washroom? Mmm-mmm . Okay. - Okay. -But we've got to hurry. All right. Okay. (GIGGLING HAPPILY) (KAREN SCREAMING) (BLOWS THUDDING) -(SPLATTERING) -(KAREN GASPING FOR AIR) Amy? (JAZZ SONG PLAYING LOUDLY) Am? (TURNS OFF MUSIC) (INAUDIBLE) (TURNS MUSIC BACK ON) Who was that? On the phone? That you had to go outside to talk to at this hour? I went outside to smoke a cigarette. (TURNS OFF MUSIC) You're smoking again? You worked so hard to quit. Work. Stress. Look who's talking. Who was on the phone... Giving you so much stress? You and I talked already. Let it go. You call that talking? Was that the guy you met in Seattle on the phone just now? Jack, it was the cell phone company. At this time of night? Setting up the replacement phone that I bought. I can't call anyone. All of my contacts are on the old phone, which I believe you still have. Can you get it for me, please? Yeah. Sure. Hey... ls there any way we could get back to normal? How about we go into town tomorrow night, have dinner at the oyster house? Jack... Jack, I want to separate. We need to separate. "We? "We? You mean you. Who is he? You can't understand. I can understand, and I am owed an explanation. Oh, no. No, I didn't mean to bring out that Jack. I didn't want to talk to that Jack. And I don't want this Amy. Where did mine go? Who are you? I know, you're right. It's not because of you. None of this is because of you, Jack. None of it is you, it's me. It's because of me. I need to become who I am meant to be. (WINCING IN PAIN) Oh, God, I'm so sorry... You just told me you would never leave me. I wouldn't. I love you. I love you so much. You were my husband, my best friend. I love you, Jack. I'm not leaving you. I'm leaving myself. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (GENTLY) Jack, come out of the rain. Thanks. When was the last time you drank right out of the bottle? I don't know. A long time. I don't know how I'd remember such a thing. Mmm. Yeah. There's a lot of shit to remember, huh? Just from the time when we met, right until this minute, a lot to remember in our life. There are some things that I would do anything to forget. Yeah. When I'm about to die, and my life flashes before my eyes, you know what, I'm all right if it skips this night. We don't die. Thoughts of death are for the ignorant. And here you must listen, because the lie that they tell us to control us is not... ls not quite a lie. We die, but we can come back. Oh, man. Oh, man. Aw... Please tell me that is not what you wanted to say to me before. 'Cause if it was, it would have been better if you hadn't said anything. You tell me you're going to walk out on me, on this, on what we have, and then you start off with all this... This New Age, hippie shit that you've never said, ever, in all the years I've known you? Who are you? I'm just trying to tell you the truth. The truth? Look it... Know what? Me putting my hand through that door, as dumb as it was, that was me. Now, I can try to control that, I can try to maybe go to a shrink and hold that pan of me back, but it's in me. (STAMMERS) It's in here, it's me, it's who I am. But that, Amy, what you just said? Did you even hear yourself? "We don't die?" Where did that come from? Why did you say that to me just now? Because I'm just trying to make you understand. - Understand. .. -Please. Please understand. Please. I know you, Amy. I know who you are. I know what to say to make you laugh. I know how you felt when your mother died. I know how you felt when our baby died. I can't. I can't. I thought I knew you, but now... Baby, I... I'm not so sure. You did. You did, Jack, you knew me better than anyone ever did or ever will. And you know me. You know me, Amy. You saved my life. That night in LA... What you did to see me through. If you hadn't... Oh, man, I'd be... I'd be dead. I'd be dead, and I mean, the kind of dead where you can't come back kind of dead. I don't know what I'd be without you, Amy. You saved me. Let me save you. I can't. I drank too much. (GASPING) You saved me. (MOBILE PHONE RINGING) Jack? It's Gary. Jack, I know you're there. We need to talk. It's too dangerous at your house. I'm here in Seattle. Meet me at that bar you hang out in tomorrow morning. I have evidence up here that I will show you, things that you need to know, things that aren't good... About Amy. (CALL DISCONNECTS) (ENGINE RACING) (CHUCKLING IN TRIUMPH) (SIGHS HEAVILY) Goddamn it, Marcus... Two minutes. Amy. I took these yesterday. I bet she told you she was home yesterday. What is this, Gary? Is this... Are you blackmailing me? Jesus, Jack. This is not an affair. But you knew that already, didn't you? This is worse. There's a group of people, who, I believe, may have killed Bill Anderson's family, and they're still trying to kill him. And I have evidence that ties your wife, Amy, to them. Let's take a walk, Jack. (TIME HAS COME TODAY PLAYS) Didn't your mum ever tell you not to pick up hitchhikers? Huh? This is what you get. Wow, how many years has she been playing? She's never played a day in her life. GARY: One of the healthiest men I know, he had me start dissolving and disbursing his fortune, so, on the day he dies, it'll all be gone. MADISON: (READING) "There are places on earth "where it is easier to cross "from the living to the dead." Soon. (GASPING IN PAIN) What are you talking about? What were you building? I made a ghost machine. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) Ripped By mstoll Happy New Year 2015 - New Year, New Color ;-)
