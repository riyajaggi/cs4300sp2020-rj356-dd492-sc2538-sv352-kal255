 We decide to move in together, and you're moving in. You think your mom had something to do with your dad? In my family, anything's possible. I need you to put the word out for the snitch who fingered Rex. How do I know you won't dead this snitch, too? You had the right affair with the wrong spouse? How you gonna prove any of this? - We have another murder. - Where? - Mayor's mansion. The new Mayor of Cypress is, Ella Johnson! - You got what we need? - I got it, but it ain't gonna get you outa here. A man can only take so much before he start makin' plans of his own. You bitch! If I go down, everybody's taking the fall. You wanna come for me? Try me. Moments away from the final buzzer,

 and the decade long rivalry between the Cypress Lions and the Eastside Bulldogs. We'll show you who snags the trophy on Channel 7 news tonight at 11. Hey- Jimmy? Are we rolling? I hate these high school gigs. Yo! Party at the crib. Party at the crib, make sure you come through. I gotta give one to... to you. Levi Sterling handles the ball for the Cypress Lions, and! He is denied by number 44! It looks like the pressure is really starting to show here in the last seconds of the game. Cypress, looking to hold on to their title with only 20 seconds remaining and Bulldogs steal and drive it down the court! It's up, it's good! Sterling's hit with a technical foul there. That is going to hurt Cypress. We've only got 15 seconds remaining in the game. You can really feel the pressure. And he makes the first one! That takes the Bulldogs up by one. That is really going to put Cypress in a hard spot. This feud has been brewing now for a solid decade, and it is certainly coming to a boiling point tonight. The bulldogs are now in a great position to runaway with this one. And there it is! We're back on the floor now with Bulldogs 73, Lions 71. With only 7 seconds left on the clock, Sterling sets it up. The pressure is on. He shoots... There's the buzzer. He misses! The Bulldogs have won the game! That's it folks! Bulldogs have won the game! Back it up Leroy boy! What are you doing in here? Morning baby. I was actually looking for your father's nameplate and I kinda got distracted. Awe, yeah. Jackpot! My old cheerleading uniform. We might need to see if this still fits baby. Nope, nope, nope... You are not going to make me late for work again! - Just a little late. Just a little late. - No... no! You brought home some of your dad's things from the church? Yeah...Just a few things that were special to me. It was weird seeing my dad's stuff in someone else's office. I'm actually meeting with the contractor for the memorial this morning. Do you want to tag along? Um, I would love to, but today is my day to do my rounds at the hospital. Maybe we can meet up later? I almost forgot I got myself a working woman. Yes you do. Your boo has not one but two hustles. Hey, whatever happened with that Medicaid investigator that came by the clinic? I never heard back about anything. So I figured no news is good news. Okay well, if you ever need me to look over any of the billing paperwork baby, let me know. Okay babe. Thanks. I will. Here we go. What are your thoughts on the murder of Mayor Clayborne? Through tragic circumstance, it's clear that our city is in need of change. I plan to aggressively seek that change starting today. The Prosecutor's Office needs a slam dunk here Herman. And we don't need any mistakes from your department. Anytime you want to do my job, Rebecca, let me know. Okay everybody, let's get down to business. Approximately thirty-six hours ago we lost one of our own, Mayor Pamela Clayborne. Leads are still streaming in from forensics. Our primary person of interest at this point is Clayborne's lead security, Ben Truman. He's neither been seen nor heard from since the night in question and he has not returned to his residence. The clock is ticking. At this time I'd like to hand over the floor to our newly appointed mayor, Ella Johnson. Excuse me a moment, Chief, if I may? I want to add that we have assembled a task force just to handle this case. We're depending on your leads, witnesses, and evidence. No sloppy reports. Maintain chain of custody. Everything must be done by the book. Thank you. Screw the paperwork. I want you guys out there in the streets. The citizens of Cypress are starting to wonder if we can keep them safe, and I don't blame them. Look at us. We're in here talking about what we need to be doing instead of out there doing it. There should be no doubt who controls this city. We need to be visible and vigilant. Find out who did this. And for the defense, do you have any closing arguments? Yes your Honor. As all the witnesses have stated... I mean, as in case of, Batson vs. Kentucky, my client's rights have been violated. Your honor, if I may. In 1986, the Supreme Court ruled that... What we got? Well, it's hopeful but you never know. They got the murder weapon. Solely on a basis of race. Mr. Murphy, I see you've done your homework on the Batson Rule. All I'm asking for is a fair trial in front of jury of my peers. I will take your motion for a new trial under advisement. Next case. You know they planted that damn gun on me. - I know. I know. - They framed me. Then-then do what I'm paying you to do and get me out of here. - Let me handle this. - Well handle it. - We'll handle it. Mr. Carter, are you ready to proceed? Yes, Your honor. We've presented a motion to dismiss, citing a lack of evidence. Mr. McGrail, do you have any objection to this motion? Yes, your honor. The murder weapon was found in the defendant's vehicle and he was identified by an eye witness putting him at the scene of the crime. Your honor, their witness identified seeing my client in a similar make and model of the car allegedly driven by the suspect at an entirely different location. Not the scene of the crime. Is this true, Mr. McGrail? The people have an additional witness, your honor, placing him at the scene of the crime- Your honor we have nothing on this as another witness. I've heard enough. Motion to dismiss is denied. What would the people like to present on bail? We would like to continue remand without bail, your honor. This defendant has shown a lot of criminal history in the community. Along with an uncanny history for avoiding criminal prosecution in this courthouse. Additionally I would like to request that all financial avenues be frozen at this time pending a further investigation- - Your honor! - The defendant is remanded. Your honor- Next case! I am a business man, your honor. And you're gonna sit up there and let them frame me because they screwed it up the first time. That's not my fault- I got this, leave me alone Carter! Watch your step here Mr. Fisher. Your police officers are throwing charges at me, trying to make 'em stick. And now you resort to plant evidence on me. Mr. Fisher, you are talking yourself into a contempt charge. Yeah well I am in contempt. I'm in contempt of you and this whole crooked ass system of yours. - Quiet down your client, Mr. Carter. - You tryin' to play dirty with me? You expect me to roll over and just take it. Well guess what? - Bailif, remove Mr. Fisher from my courtroom. - I invented playing dirty! I tell you what, you wanna try and take me down? Well I got somethin' on you and everybody else in this whole damn courtroom! Your police officer. Your politician. Everybody's going down with me. I'm not going down by myself. You'll see what I'm gonna do. You better deal with it Carter! You better get me out of here! How's it going, Nick? We're hanging on by a thread, Theresa. We barely had enough evidence for this bail hearing. How can we help? Putting that gun in his hand would help. Rex is still inside. You know Jabari flipped on him. What? You want me to send somebody over to the crib? Naw, I've been waiting a long time for this. I'm gonna take care of him myself. Damn, it's like that bro? Yeah, it's just like that. Hey man, just keep it clean, brotha. Keep it clean. Damn. I'ma hit you back. License and registration please. You know why I pulled you over? No but I can guess. Dispatch, I need you to run a license. 030119852. You gonna check my ID like you don't know who I am, Coop? No warrants on that I. D. Any drugs or contraband in the vehicle? No. I need you to step out the car. Based on what? Are we gonna have a problem? Step out of the vehicle. I don't consent to no search. We got anything, partner? Man, I got a permit for that! Check the trunk. Up against the car. Put your hands above your head! Put them up now! What? Hey, wha-what's going on? Get down! Officer requesting assistance. Possible 10-54 on Main and MLK. You've got the right to remain silent. Get up! Wait a minute. What's the charge? I ain't do nothing. You call that nothin? Turn around! - Yo, we good? - Yup, we're good! - Plan worked like a charm. - Alright. Everything went as planned. What about the rest of it? Don't got nothin' to worry about. Baby, you think we'll just be able to live our lives, business as usual, after this? I just wish you would've talked to me about this first. Baby, I planned this out to a T. Okay? And even if that goes wrong, got a plan for that too. Alright? We got the cash, IDs, keys to the safe house... and this. Long as we have this, we safe from Rex. You trust me don't you? You know I do baby. I'm just not sure double crossing Rex was the move. Hey, it was the move! Look, I don't want us to live looking over our shoulder anymore. And Jada and you deserve better. I need to know that you're with me. Okay, what I'm doing is real. And it's gonna change our lives but I need to know that you got my back. Look, no matter what! You know I do baby. I wonder how Coop got so lucky? Yeah I imagine he's going to be pretty unbearable after this. Congratulations appear to be in order. I'm sure the details of your arrest will be in your report? Of course. Let's go. Two down and one to go. If we can get him to roll on Jabari, we'll have their whole crew. Thank you for taking me on such short notice! No problem. I've been meaning to call you and congratulate you on the opening of your new clinic. You know I've been doing some pro bono work at a few clinics, but I've never owned any of them. Girl, the church owns the clinic. I just run it. Same difference. I guess I don't even have to ask how things are going between you and that fine man of yours. Hummm... Hmmmmm... found ya! You are definitely pregnant. I'd say about 8 weeks. Eight weeks? Are you sure? Give or take a day. Is that not the answer that you wanted to hear? I haven't been with my boyfriend that long. Well, you never know, he might be excited about the news. No, no, no. I don't think you understand. I haven't been with my boyfriend...THAT long. Damn Christie, what do you wanna do? It's your body. Your life. Your choice. Girl, it's been so long since I really thought about what I want, that I don't know anymore. Look, no judgement. Take one immediately. And then take the rest according to the packaged instructions. At this point, it's only about ninety-seven point three percent effective. - How are you? - I'm doing great honey. Hi Quincy how are you? Great to see y'all. - I got a little somethin' waitin' for you. - I know what it is honey! - We have much to discuss, much to discuss! - Yes darling! - How was the trip? - It was okay... Your career inspired most of those hits. You a musician? I used to know a lot of musicians. Yeah, you used to have jam sessions at the house. Is that how we know each other? Y- y-you rolled back through in '73, right? No, Dad. I'm your son. You're not my son. My son name Miles, just like the great one. Yea, that's me dad. Why you want to tell these lies? My son is famous. He's on the radio. Yeah I used to be, Dad, but now I've moved on. I'm- Stop calling me Dad. Cece! Cece, where you at girl? Cece? - Sing it - I'm singing it girl. The two of you must be so excited honey! You know I thought I would never get any grandkids out of you. Yeah well, it has been a wild ride. Well you just make sure you take advantage of, of everything before that little baby comes, okay? And, do we know what we're having? A girl or a boy? I do know, but Miles wants to be surprised. Life has enough surprises. - Mom? - Yeah? How long has he been like this? It started getting worse over the past few months. Just last week he jumped into one of the neighbors cars and tried to drive off and he doesn't even have his license anymore. Why didn't you tell me? - I didn't want to bother you son. - You could never bother me. You're the one that always said "A closed mouth doesn't gets fed." I raised you well. - I love you mom. - I love you too, son. You got something for me? Hey, you forget something? Problem? We got a problem. Money's short. Nah, it's all there. Check that. Is it all there? You trying to short me? I'm taking all the risk, putting my ass on the line, so you can keep running your business. Things is changing around here. Didn't you hear? Your services are no longer needed, Officer Cooper. What did you say? Hold up. You look like you getting a little upset there. Like you might do something irrational. No, I ain't upset, just give me my money man. - Hold on, hold on. - Give me my money. Whatchu gonna do? Shoot me out here in front of all these people? Really? That's how you feel? Y'all see this? You think this little move is going to stop me from getting mine? You better check yourself son. I'll come back. Alright. We have a suspect in custody for Pamela's murder. Is he talking? Do we know what happened? Alright, we're still piecing it together. All we know is he's part of Rex's crew. He lawyered up already. I should have known. Well at least they're helping me get a head start to cleaning up this city. Does he know about Pamela? Can't be sure. He's in and out of consciousness. Has he said anything? Travis... You want to get along with me you stay on the line at all times. You don't breathe unless I say so. You don't piss until I say so. Lockdown! Lights out! Nice scarf Mom. Thanks Teeny. Just thought I'd try something new. Something new What? I know what happened with Ford. Hospital gossip is worse than church gossip. Lord... Are you sure you're okay? Let me take a look at- - No I'm fine. - No, mom- No I'm fine. Nothing that a little make up won't cure. Mother, I'm looking at it. Thank you. My God! I don't understand how you can be so calm. Honey the man didn't know what he was doing okay? He suffered. Now is that why you really came over here? So what is it? Okay Christine, I know you. What's going on? What? I'm pregnant. Teeny, baby! Awe. Aw! That's wonderful! O...kay, so what's wrong? I haven't told Levi yet. Well why not? It's not Levi's baby. Wha- wait a minute. Miles?! Really Christie? I raised you better than that. Okay mom look, I didn't come over here for a lecture from you. I just need you to tell me what to do. You know Teeny, I am here for you baby, you know that. - Mom! - No, but this one decision you're going to have to make on your own. Miles Callaway, Really Christie? Look at God. We got a problem? - You recognize me? - No I don't. Well... it'll come to you. I ain't got no problems with you young blood. Get your hands off me, man. My father's dead 'cause of you. You got to answer to that. Let tell you something. Your daddy's downfall ain't my problem you little bitch. Enjoy your hot dog! Enjoy your hot dog! Stop that! Come on man. I'm good., I'm good. Let's go Max. Sup? What up? So look, there's gonna be a couple changes around here. Yeah, I heard. What'd you hear? That you flipped on Rex. And left him hangin' in jail. That's what I heard. First of all, I ain't no snitch. Let's get that straight. I ain't do nothing to Rex that he ain't already to do himself. So, so you bossin' up now? See this is Rex's shop and nothing's gon' change that. You ain't gotta worry about that no more. Alright so get down or you lay down. Which one? I see how it is. You've been making moves for a while now Time for you to make the next one. Hmph. Yeah. All good. Yeah. Anybody else? A suspect has been apprehended in the shocking murder of Mayor Pamela Clayborne. Where she was gunned down in her own home - Thats what I thought. The back room is closed down. Travis Ford also a victim of a gunshot wound to the chest, remains at Cypress General Hospital. Currently in stable condition. Yeah, I looked over the finalized plans for the sculpture and it is beautiful. Really it's a pretty easy job Levi. We just take out this old slab here. Put in a new on that's strong enough to hold it. Sounds like we're all set. Really appreciate you giving us this discount Brother Sanders. Hey, my pleasure Levi. Happy to do this for Pastor. Chris! Chris! What the hell are you doing here? I got a new batch of numbers. I was in the area. Just figured we could do some business. You're not a business man Jabari, you're a thug. Woah, woah, woah. Your pill popping ass do business with me. So doesn't that make you a thug too? We shut it down anyway. A Medicaid agent paid us a visit. Well when was you gonna tell me that? When were you going to tell me you helped Rex kill my father? Woah, I had nothing to do with your father's death. Really? You had nothing to do with my father's death? Why should I believe you? - Christie you should know me better than that? - Why should I believe you? Come on! You know I could never do something like that to Pastor. Even after everything! Really? Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Come here, man. So what do we do now Jabari? Go collect the rest of the checks alright? I'll get at you after the heat dies down. - Alright? - Alright. - Morning CeCe. - Morning baby. Where do you keep your coffee filters? I've got to setup Quincy's coffee like I do at home, or else he will go into a tailspin baby, just... He's a handful for you Routine is my savior girl. You know what? You'll know what I mean when that baby gets here. Children are a handful too. - Morning! - Morning son. Morning mom! Good Morning baby. Hi. Hey so mom... I want you to come to the studio so you can see what I've been working on. - Okay. - I need to borrow her. - Yeah... - See what I mean girl? - You gonna like this. - I know I will. I'll make the coffee. Great!... Come on! That's what I'm taking about. I like it. It sounds good honey, but I think you need to put just a little more bounce in it. - You know how we do it. - More bounce in it. Yeah, yeah. Why did you stop singing Ma, you still got pipes. Baby, you know what? I had a son to raise. And you were more important than a song. Cece! Stop! Come on! Miles! Miles! What is that? Quincy. Quincy, I need you to- Tamara I'm sorry! Cece! Is that the fire alarm? Get up. Can you get up? Can you- - Dad? - Help! - Dad! - Help Cece! - Hey! Cece a little help here! - Cece help here. - Tam! Tam, Babe-baby, be still. - It was an accident. - What did you do? - It was an accident! Just be still. What did you do? - Call 911. - Call 911. Why'd you hit her I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Pregnant, head trauma. Slight smoke inhalation. Blood pressure 120 over 70. She gonna be alright, right? Sir, we have to take her now. You'll need to stay here. The doctor will come out and talk with you. Well, where's the doctor? Mr. Calloway, I need to get some info from you about your wife. - How far along is she? - 13 weeks. - Does she have any allergies? - Not that I know of. Okay that's all I need for now. Thank you. Hey what are you doing here? Tam had an accident. I hope it wasn't serious. Do you even mean that? Of course I mean that Miles I am not a spiteful person. What happened between us had nothing to do with her. Listen..um... I wan... I'm listening. What are you trying to say to me? What are you talking about? I- Nothing. It's, it's not the right time. You have a lot going on. Christie... I'm pregnant Miles. And it's yours. Wha... Mr. Calloway? Your wife is asking for you. Right this way. There's something buried here. Hey, Levi! My God! My God! Tam, Tam, are you okay honey? I am so sorry. You know Quincy he didn't mean any harm. He just get's agitated at times. Cece, we're fine. - It's okay mom. - Praise God. Doctor says she needs some rest so I'm going to take her upstairs okay? - Okay. - Alright, come on. - Alright, I'm glad you're home. - Thank you. - Take your time. - I am. Hold on the the rail. I got you. She's okay mom. I'm really sorry about all this Tam. - I'm gonna get a hotel for my parents. - Don't do that. I'm fine. I don't want you to feel like this could happen again. Weirdly this actually feels like we're a real family. The Lord works in mysterious ways. Get some rest. Mom! I'm gonna run out and grab a prescription for Tam. Mom? Mom! I'm sorry to do this to you, son. But you yourself reminded me "a closed mouth never gets fed." The things your father needs, I can't provide, but I know you can. Take this opportunity to get to know him again. You two are more alike than you think. I love you. Mom. Travis. Are you having trouble? You know, you'd be surprised with some of the many perks that come with being Mayor. But... then again, you know don't you? I know everything. You know, I realize that. And I asked myself over and over again "Why would he do that to me?" I should have killed you instead of your husband. You killed Evan? You killed him when you started sleeping with my wife. I thought it was him. I should have known he would never have done that to me. I'm gonna expose you for the slut you are. No. Who I am Travis, is mayor of this great city. And I worked very hard to get here. And you're not gonna take that away. We'll see about that. 'Cause see, I don't have anything to lose. Yes, you do. The only thing that really matters. This season on Saints and Sinners: The Lord is the light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? We're just tryin' to find out how her body ended up buried at the church. You gotta admit something is not right with that family. And the church. I haven't been with anybody since I been with you. Think we should tell her about the baby? Are you crazy? Why do you keep doin' this to us? You gotta be really close to somebody to keep this type of secret. You live like a boss, you gotta be a boss. I thought you were Rex's partner. I'm makin' my own rules now. Jabari is tryin' to squeeze you out, man. I know your game. And you ain't never catchin' up. Don't worry about me. I got a plan. I can finally... who did it. What would you like me to do? I just need to know. Corruption is happening. Let's be the ones who stop it. If I go down, I plan on dragging you right along with me. Hello, mother. I get so tired of cleaning up your messes! You may have everyone else fooled, but I know you have bodies buried Ella. You told me you had this handled! You said you had this all figured out! You can't do that! You ain't got the right to do that! Why?! My enemies would rather burn me at the stake than see changes.
