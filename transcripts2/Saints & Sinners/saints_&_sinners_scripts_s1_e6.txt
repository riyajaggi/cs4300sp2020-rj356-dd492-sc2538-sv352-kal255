 Previously on Saints and Sinners Tamara Austin? Have you had any other pain? Honey when you're married to Miles Calloway... Pain and suffering it just... Goes away and becomes part of the daily ritual. Tamara please I can change. Look I bought all these new things for the baby. I even ordered new baby books. You think ordering books is going to change anything? What do you think you're doing showing up here? Your husband signed the church over to me a long time ago.

 I want to be your partner Rex. We've got to find a way to keep him quiet and out of sight until the election. Then I'm going to find his ass and lock him up my first day of office. These fools trying to play games with me. Go to work. [RACHEL SCREAMING] Who did this? Who do you think? I borrowed money from Rex. You what? I know. I know. Zeke? Do you have my money? No.

 [ZEKE SCREAMING] Now we do this the easy way... Or I gotta do it the hard way and I don't want that. [GROANING IN PAIN] 7- C-A-X as in X-Ray 27. What's that? The license plate number. Welcome to the 9th annual Greater Hope neighborhood block party. [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE] Yeah. All right let me tell you what we've got. Ok? We got games for the kids. Food for the adults. We have choirs for you music lovers. And yes we have some Bingo. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] All right. [INDISTINCT CROWD] How's Rachel? Oh she's better. And you? Oh me? Well... Sometimes I feel like I'm standing in the light. And other times I feel like I'm standing in quicksand. No one's going to let you sink. Any more harassment from Rex? Besides Rachel? He was involved with that? Pamela I made a deal with the devil. I regret that every day. I thought you paid him back from the money returned from the evidence. That man doesn't get his hooks into people for the money. He enjoys the game. He's going out of his way to prove that he can get to anyone I care about. The only way to fight Rex is to get a hook into him. Sounds like you have some experience. I do. When I was prosecutor I had him on accessory to murder. Until my star witness recanted so Rex walked. I've felt guilty ever since. I feel even worse now. Look it is not your fault what he's doing to me. Nah it's not just you. It's about everybody else he's hurt since he's gotten away. Excuse me. [ GROANS ] Lady Ella... You're looking as beautiful as always. Oh thank you. What are you ladies gossipping about? [ LAUGHS ] We're not gossipping. Just girl... Lady... Mayor stuff. Don't get too sweaty. Ok? I know... 'Cause we have photos to take. Yeah. What was that? Do you think he knows about us? I don't know. ♪ DOWN LIFT YOUR HANDS GIVE GOD THE PRAISE ♪ ♪ I FELL SO HARD ♪ LOST MY FAITH IN GOD ♪ I COULDN'T EVEN PRAY ♪ SO I SAY ♪ WE'RE JUST SINNERS ♪ SAVED BY GRACE [ MUSIC PLAYING] What's that license plat number again? 7 Charlie Alpha X-ray 278. 7- C-A-X-278. That's a match. What this... This it? This the car. Finally a break. These cars are spotless. We'll never get a print. When was it cleaned? Well all the cars are... Washed as soon as they're returned. So... What's the name of the person who last drove this car? At least a dozen people... In the last couple of weeks. Who drove the car the night of the sixth? The... The record for that date is missing. Can you at least tell us who was working that night? I can get you the employee time sheets sent over to your office. I mean they're hard copies. I don't have them here. What are we going to do now? Hey... Do those work? Sure. Uh but you're going to have to get authorization from the Mayor's Office for that. Yes. I need authorization for security tapes. Noah St. Charles. Alright. Thanks. [SIGHS] What'd they say? The only person who has the authority to let us see the security footage is the Mayor. Okay then what did she say? She didn't say anything. She's making an appearance at a community engagement. Of course. Where? Greater Hope Baptist Church. ♪ He's mighty He's so mighty ♪ ♪ He's wonderful ♪ Worthy of the praise ♪ ♪ My God is worthy of the praise ♪ ♪ My God is worthy of the praise ♪ ♪ It would take a day [ SINGING CONTINUES ] Pam can you move in just a little bit? Ami, can you face here? Yeah and line up. Yeah. All right. So... Keep practicing. I'll be right back. Wait... Wait, wait, wait. I don't want to share my personal space with you right now... Or ever. Ok Cool. Cool. I get that. I get that. Then you should also get that you're the last person that I want to stand and converse with. You know I once had an amazing conversation with you father... If this story takes a second too long... I was feeling very confident and proud of myself. And your father noticed and asked what was going on. And I began to explain how... I was finally getting it. You know how my faith was coming together. Five more seconds to go Miles. He asked me had I learned to forgive... Each and every person that... Had ever done anything wrong to me. That until I learned to forgive... Faith couldn't grow or stay in my heart. Good for you. Now go home and ask your pregnant wife to forgive you. Your father was right. He was always right about everybody's faith. My father was a wise man despite his faults. You're not even hearing what I'm trying to say... I'm trying not to hate you. Listening to you pales in comparison. [SIGHS ] How's that going for you? Not hating you? Not great. I'm sorry to hear that. Goodbye Miles. I'll see you around. [KNOCKING AT DOOR] Come in. Where's the arm sling I gave you? I don't need it. If you didn't need it I wouldn't have insisted you wear it. I'm fine. Really. You got your ass beat by a group of neighborhood kids. Your arm has a hairline fracture and contusions. And you patched me up and made everything all better. Ok? I'm good. Really. You're wearing that sling. [Sighs] Christie just... Listen for a... Listen. My daughter's going to be here in a minute. I don't want her focusing on this. She won't have a good time. Hey. Hey Banana. Hey. Look at you. [GROANS] What happened? Oh nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I'm glad you're here. Look this is Christie. Christie my daughter Savannah. - Hi. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you too. And thank you for doing that solid for me. The airport was on the way, no problem. Since I missed your birthday... - I got you something special. - Awe. Awe... What's wrong? Nothing... It's... Do you like it? Ladies? Great choice. Great choice. It'll look much better on. Wrong color? No. No... It's fine. But there are going to be a lot of activities. Maybe she can wear it later. Maybe we should leave you two alone... No. No. No. We're fine. Actually I wanted to ask you about Pastor Johnson's P. O. box? Oh we got it handled. - We? - Yeah. The P. O. box was actually for the clinic. Only temporary until the clinic opened. It's a good thing Angela was on top of it. Anything I can do to help the clinic. Can you try to be a little less obvious that you and I are all of a sudden best friends? Oh I'm sorry. I thought we were best friends. We have an arrangement... Which means we're in a cease fire... Not friends. We're never friends. So what is this? Oh mom told me to give it to you. You're not gonna come back home are you? Savannah... Would you like to go down to the block party until your dad can meet us there? Can I? Yeah. [Clears Throat] Wait... Hold on Banana. I'm glad you're here baby. Come on. I don't blame you for wanting to be comfortable. Are you sure you don't want to just try it on? Are you gonna change? Change? Girl do you know how hard it was for me to put this dress on? Well you do look very nice. Thanks. But I actually wore this for my mom. So you don't like it? It's not bad. Sometimes you do things to make the ones you love happy. Like put on a dress you don't want to wear. So you really grew up in this big ole' place? Yup. Every night I would sit right there and listen to my dad preach in the pulpit. But how could someone spend so much time in a church? Actually I had a lot of fun. I had a lot of secret spots. I used to love to read right up there. It was always quiet and peaceful. I've got tickets. Trust me... A lot has changed since then. I see you're having a lot of success here. Savannah will you at least just try it on? But my dad doesn't know what to get me. He doesn't even know what I like. Well if you don't like it... Stuff it right back into the box. Huh? There's a dressing room right behind that door. Awe. What is your problem? I don't have a problem. You're the one trying to get Levi's daughter to like you. It's like watching a train wreck way before it happens. You want to see a train wreck? Keep testing me. As long as you keep paying me to stay quiet... There's no reason to test you. That's great. An offer is an offer right? Okay. Let me know. Thanks. You got an offer? It's not the price I wanted... But at least it is an offer. That should make you happy right? Happy? Maybe relieved. Where's Savannah? She's trying on the dress. Glad to hear that. Thank you. Oops... Or not. [Laughs] I guess we can go ahead and hit the block party. Uh yeah. [Sighs] Did you at least like the box? Yeah the box was all right. [Indistinct Crowd] Levi. Good to see you. Yeah. And who is this? I'm Savannah. Yes of course. Look at you all grown. Savannah this is Jada. You two are cousins. Oh. - Hi. - Hi. Can we go play? Yeah. Right. Cute girl. How's the arm? Watch it man. Watch it. What do you care? Cause man I warned you. Look you tell me you've got the money I might be able to do somethin'. But until then you're on your own. What happened to you? I thought we were family. I'm doin' what I got to do. And I suggest you do the same. [MUSIC PLAYING] All right. Everybody remember to pick up your raffle ticket. Ok see I got mine. You got to get your own. All right. Seriously let's remember this is a fundraiser. So have some fun... But let's raise that money. [PEOPLE CHEERING] All right? Now the church ain't greedy. It's just needy. All right. [LAUGHING] [SOUNDS OF THE BLOCK PARTY] [SOUNDS OF THE BLOCK PARTY] You better watch out for that one. She's gonna give you nothing but trouble. She's nothing but trouble already. Believe me. And bossy. When she turns sixteen... I'm gonna change my name and leave the country. I wasn't talking about your daughter. I was talking about mine. Did you decide what you're going to do about Rex yet? And the deed? And is everyone working for him now? Only the Devil knows how to work with that man. So what does that say about us? We're resourceful. We're gonna find a way to beat him. What's the next move? We gotta give the dog a bone as often as we can. I mean that's the only way right now. Where do we find the bones? Looks like we've got a lot of money floatin' our way today. Lady Ella... No disrespect... But we're gonna need every dime that we raise here today just to keep the church from going under. I understand that Levi. I know better than anyone how deep the hole is. But we just got to stay out of his path until we... Sort things out. Around here it seems like the only way to stay out of Rex's path is in a coffin. Here. Take this. I don't need that. This belonged to Pastor Johnson. Now I know he would rather you have it and not need it... Than to need it and not have it. Here. No. No. No you keep that.

Listen you're ready. Ok? You'll be fine. No listen. Don't try to get on my last nerve. I'm not trying. No. - Listen I'm sorry. - Miles no. - You'll be fine. - No. Today of all days... No. Hey.

And then... You came here. Typical Miles. Typical. Constantly putting your family second. Why can't you believe in me? Yes I went there and I left... Because I knew I needed to be here for you. - You needed to be here? - Okay wanted. Listen... My first priority from now on is my vow to you. If there's ever a choice between something else and my family... I'm choosing us every time. I don't know Miles.

[Crowd Amens] Amen. I would like to thank all the choirs that have blessed us by... Coming to the stage with such beautiful beautiful gospel.

I am moved to immeasurable depths of appreciation for Mayor Clayborne's support. And I appreciate all of you... As we celebrate this Ninth Annual Neighborhood Block Party... Started by my husband... Pastor Evan Johnson. With your blessings and votes for Mayor of Cypress... Reducing crime in our neighborhoods will be my highest priority. None of us should have to live under the suffocation of delinquancy and misconduct... Towards citizens of our community. It is my deepest concern... That things in our community may have to get a lot worse... Before they can get a lot better. But I assure you... That things will get better. [CROWD CHEERS] Thank you. Thank you so much. And vote for me. [Laughs] [CROWD CONTINUES CHEERING] [CROWD CONTINUES CHEERING] You ready to go yet? We're not going to find anything here. Maybe you spoke too soon. Christie. I need you to get Savannah out of here. What happened? Daddy? Just... - Levi what happened to you? - Just listen listen listen... It's not safe for her to be here. I need you to... I need you to take her Ok? I need to take care of something and I'll be right behind you. I promise. [ Christie ] Levi. Just go. What happened? Are you Ok? I'm Ok. No. I'm fine. Ain't gonna be no problem with you Levi is there? No. Nah. It's all business now. Good cause I'm about to turn the heat up on all of them. - You feel me? - I feel you. Let me tell you something...

Alright. Hey how's it going? Thanks again. Mrs. Clayborne? I'm still Mayor. Mayor. Prosecutor. Clayborne. Don't mean nothin' to me. Well, It will when I'm state senator. - Yeah? - Yeah. You hear that? That's crickets, lady. Nobody cares what you tryin' to call yourself these days. You don't even understand the big picture do you? Being a state senator gives me the eyes and ears of the entire state So I'm gonna be watching you, closely. Well you had your chance once and you failed. Only reason you keep comin' after me is to get the egg off your face. Far as I'm concerned, I don't care who you are you ain't never going to be able to make anything stick. I'm what you call, "untouchable." No one is untouchable. Soon you're going to be looking over your shoulder, you're not going to know who to trust. And the next time, I'm going to make sure they put your ass down a rat hole for the rest of your life. Cricket's lady. That's all I hear. [ KISS NOISES ] Idiot. [ INDISTINCT COVERSATION ] So what was that all about? Just putting my hooks in him. [ MUSIC ] Hey, pass me my camera. [ SHUTTER CLICKS ] [ KNOCKING ] Yes? It's Levi. - Hey Brother. - Hey Pastor Greene. Looks like we did pretty good today. Pretty good? Nah, we made a killing man. We had a awesome day, Brother. Pastor, I'm sorry. I'm not going to be able to make all the entries today. Everything okay? Yeah, it's just that my daughters in town and I really want to spend some time with her. Okay. [ KNOCKING ] Who is it? It's Lady Ella. Hi, may I talk to Levi? Lady Ella, we're a bit busy. [ Lady Ella ] I just need a word with Levi. Brother Sterling. Lady Ella needs to see you outside. I'll go see what she needs. I'm gonna take care of that family thing as well. Levi... "For he will give his angels charge concerning you, to guard you in all your ways." Now go take care of that family situation. Well it worked. Are you sure about this? Look, this is on me not you. Okay, Rex will be here any second. You should go. I'm not leaving you here. I'll be okay. I know how to handle Rex. He just wants to hurt the people I care about, just to prove a point. But, he would never hurt me. I wish I could believe that. Look, you should leave. This is enough money to keep him in check for a minute - Okay. - Oh Levi, wait... - I can't take that! - No, you have to... You have to take it. Please. If I take that, that makes me just as bad as them. Yes but at least you'll be armed and able to protect yourself. Look I lost a husband. I'm not ready to lose anybody else. - Okay, okay... - Just go, now! My ears are burning. Seeing you two together, it all makes sense now. Is this where the ladies go to gossip? What? You hiding behind your mama's skirt Levi? Just go home. I can handle it. You shouldn't even be here. Need to let the grown folks sort this out. [ CHUCKLING ] You got my money? Huh? [ GLASS CLINKS ] She's sleeping. Thank you Christie. I don't know what I would have done without you today. Let me help you. Let me take a look at these bandages. [ GROANS PAINFULLY ] What are you doing with that? I wanted to use it on someone. But I lost my nerve. You know what, Levi. Ten percent of your life is what happens to you. Ninety percent of your life is how you respond to what happens to you. You want to know what happened to me? My daughter served me with my divorce papers. My career is over. I'm probably gonna go to prison for insider trading. I got my ass whooped by the neighborhood thugs. And now they threatened daughter. Who threatened Savannah? Rex. Why? Your father put us in a bind. Your mother knows about it. Apparently we all need to protect ourselves. That's my father's gun isn't it? What does it matter whose gun it is? Your mother feels my life is in danger enough to just give it to me. So... Give it back to her. He threatened my daughter! If they want to go after you, that gun won't stop them, it'll only make them come after you faster with more vengeance. You don't understand! I swear I'm losing it. I don't know what to do. I keep trying... I keep trying to make everything right and I'm not fixing anything. I'm making it worse. [ GUN CLICKS ] [ SIGHS ] I'm sorry. [ WHISPERS ] I'm sorry. - Here you go honey. - Thanks. So did you have a good time with Christie yesterday? You guys seem to be getting along. Is she your girlfriend? What would make you think that? - Good Morning. - Morning. Did you rest well Savannah? Mmhmm. Did you spend the night? You know what baby, Christie and I were up talking and um, it got late. Too late for her to drive home. And so, she stayed. Yeah my friend's dad got married to someone else, and she said no matter how nice she is, she'll never be her mom. Mmmm. You know what? You should have... this coffee is incredible. Taste that. Taste that and you shouldn't talk with your mouth full. Baby let's do something with your hair. Let's get your hair done. Come on. Gotta get ready for church. We can eat in a second. We'll be back. You got a minute? No I'll come find you when I do. It's about the Mayor What about the Mayor? One thing all our leads have in common is Mayor Clayborne. Detectives, you do know how hot the fire gets when you step into this burning building? We're already are on fire and we haven't even stepped into any burning building. What in the world? The two of them? Together? Makes for a motive to get rid of their husbands. And maybe the other one is next. You two have done enough. I'll handle things from here. [ KNOCKING ] Excuse me. Lieutenant Hawkins is here. Alright. Send her in. You sure? Yeah, it's okay. Thanks Truman. This way. - Theresa. - Mayor. What can I do for you? I need to talk about the Johnson case. Well, you could have just called but please have a seat. This needed to be done in person. Sounds serious. Well, it could be. Off the record, I need to ask, what is the true nature of the relationship between you and Councilwoman Ella Johnson. Well, I really don't think that's any of your business but, if you must know, we're friends. How good of friends? What are you implying? The evidence speaks for itself. It was her husband. They had financial problems. She has ties with the local crime boss and she has access to city vehicles. You were a prosecutor. Connect the dots. This is all... This is just... it's all just... circumstansial at best. We're waiting on the final piece of evidence from your office. Now once the surveillance footage comes back, I'm hoping we'll have all the answers. I approved the request the minute it came across my desk. As soon as I have it I will turn it over to you. I appreciate it. Pamela, you might want to rethink your endorsement of her, until we figure this out. Don't let your friendship cloud your judgement. Ben! Yes Ma'am. Did you ever get that footage I requested? [ DEVICE CLICKS ] [ DEVICE CLICKS ] We've got a problem. What do you need me to do? Get rid of this. Make sure there are no copies. No one ever needs to see that. Consider it done. [ BANGS DESK ] [ SIGHS ]
