NO, NO, THIS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO GO LIKE THIS! [GUNSHOTS] This season on Saints and Sinners: What have we got? They found him around 9:45 P. M. Close range, shot through the back of the head. No robbery? Sounds personal to me. Tragedy has once again struck the First Family of Greater Hope Baptist Church. Any idea who could have done this? My family's run this church for over four decades. He treated everybody like family. People don't get shot like that for nothin'. Seems every time another black man steps up to lead he gets shot back down. This church needs you, Levi. We know the Pastor owed you money. Do you know who did it? Since you in charge now, Pastor debt is your debt. - You sure about this? - Look this is on me, not you. What happened to all the campaign money? I lost a husband. I'm not ready to lose anybody else. Family is everything, right? Family is everything. We got a problem. On your head. What's up with this Pastor? I don't know, but we better find out, because I don't have a good feeling about this. You know it was strictly business, right? Nothing personal. How do you separate the two? ♪ We're just sinners Saved by grace
