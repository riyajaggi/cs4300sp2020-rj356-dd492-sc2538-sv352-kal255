 - Sorry, I didn't see it was you. - Just as long as you pay up... - Absolutely. Of course. - Your daughter's name is Kim, right? - Yes. - Kim... Funny name for a girl. - Kim? Kim... - I'm so sorry. If he lets you kiss his hand, let's go from there... I'm out of luck today. My God... - Jonna? - Mikael Rosén? - Hi, so nice to see you. - What are you doing here? I'm the new hostess, but it's just for one season. She's here for the whole season.

 - Do you know the play? - Yes. Why didn't you and Oskar finish the pool? He lost interest. You left. This church is growing on me. Have I told you I don't like churches? No. It has to do with the stillness here. The smell and the echo. The coffee tastes a bit better. Have you told anyone else? No, I haven't told anyone. So I'm the only one that knows? You don't count. Because I'm a priest?

 Because I trust you. Isn't that a burden? A burden? Feelings of guilt and... What was I to do? I had no choice. - You always have a choice. - I had to move him. That has nothing to do with guilt. I'm sorry... Listen... I'm sorry. When I said I trust you it wasn't because you're a priest. It's because of the way you are. We have no issue with your insurance claim, but the ball isn't in our court. But with the police? As I said on the telephone... What the hell do I do about my staff? They want their pay checks. - That's why I have insurance. - I understand your situation. Is the nothing we can do? You'll have to find another way of paying. Who is going to give a loan to someone suspected of arson? THICKER THAN WATER Listen to me. We must leave now. Yes, it's about time. I'll make it to Raguni's today. We just have to catch the train. Well done, everyone. Soon everything will be in place. - Thanks for today. - Thanks. Yeah, it'll all be in place soon. I wonder if we're working on the same play? - Are you nervous? - Me? No, I'm terrified. I can't remember my lines. - Bye. - Bye. - Relax, you'll get it. - Yeah, but when? Preferably before the premiere. Maybe I'm getting senile. Is the first sign the inability - to learn Chekhov by heart? - Yes, your condition is incurable. Get well soon. See you. Wait. Can't you help me? Or are you punching in for work? - No, not really. - Will you go over lines with me? For an hour or so? I'll treat you to some food. - Great. - Good. - And an order of spare ribs. - Thanks. So... When did you have the time to set this up? I have a standing reservation. - You tricked me! - No, more like a surprise. - Shall we read? - Yes. What's that? I've just drawn some. - Houses? - No, it's actually the guest house. I got and idea that maybe we could... - make it bigger. - Show me. - No, it's silly. - No, show me. I had a vision of maybe expanding. Modernising maybe. To create a total experience instead of the usual coffee and biscuits. - Here comes the food. - Yes. It's an onion. You have to learn. Ouch! Damn... - Hi. - Hi. - You've come a long way. - Yeah, it's going good. Nice. I'm going to start posting soon and could use some help. You want to jump in? I'll jump in when there's some water in it. Come on. We said we wanted to do this together. Yes, but we have guests arriving on a large boat and we haven't dropped the buoy yet. So would you be able to do that? I'm busy here. Can you ask someone else? It's a bit heavy and we brag about our marina. We can also brag about the pool when it gets finished. - Yeah. - Come on, Oskar. What? I wanted us to do this together. Just a couple hours? Why don't you drive up to the house? I want to avoid any misunderstanding. Okay. You have to study the script, as you're not there quite yet. Not even close. Can't we do this again sometime? Reading some, eating some? I'll see you. Cecilia? - What are they doing? - I think they're working. - How's it going with Kim? - Poorly. She's even afraid of onions. Right. Can you take this to room three? Thanks. - It's Kim, right? - Damn, you startled me! Come. - A surreal self-portrait? - No, it's a cockroach. Did you know there are 4,000 types of cockroaches? - They'll outlast all of us. - You only have 3,999 more to paint. Is that your chat with Beelzebub? No. It's a Mexican death alter. They worship the dead. And those that have lived aren't afraid like us. You have an insect kingdom and spaces for prayer and you're hanging out on Åland? I have a sail boat. So I get away sometimes. - Where to? - Once to Grislehamn. - That's far. - Yeah, I had a mast failure. Cool. Have you written a new contract with the employees? - Yes. - Yes. A contract that gives them their pay. Even if the bar has burnt down. Yes, doesn't the government cover all the wages? Yes, maybe. Yes, that's how it is. There are a lot of other costs that have to be covered. - Yeah, but you have insurance, right? - Yes. Damn it, Lasse. You have insurance, right? Of course. Here. It turns out they don't pay under certain circumstances. Like what? If they suspect arson. It never ends. It's one thing after another. I'm stuck and completely broke. - Arson? - Yes. Have the police contacted you? Who did it? It doesn't matter. Of course it does. The insurance payment is stalled as long as it's being investigated. Yeah... Holy shit. Remind me to never start a business with you, especially on an island or a guest house. What a catastrophe. - There it is, turn it on. - Yes. There it is, yes. Good. - Hi. - Hi. I brought bed linen. Were you together? Lasse and I? Yes. It was long before you were born. - Five hundred crowns. - What? - I didn't see anything. - What do you mean? I saw you smelling his clothes. No, I was just checking to see if they were dirty. I was doing a load of whites in 60 degrees. Five hundred crowns, and no one will know what you did. You think we're all fools, don't you? There's only one smart person on the island, and that's you. Sorry. - Do you have any dirty laundry? - No. - See you later, Cecilia. - Hello. They said I'd run into you here. Do you have time to talk? - Yes. - Yeah, can we take a seat here? I'm still looking for the lead role and as you know the Germans are having doubts about using an unknown actor. - Yeah, I was the wrong choice. - No. Actually, I think you're exactly what we're looking for. I want to make another audition tape, it that's okay. - To convince my German friends. - Absolutely. - Can we do that? - Yes. Of course. Maybe it's not such an awful job, building a swimming pool. "Waldemar Brothers Pools - take a dip, whenever you want." I thought you didn't want to start a business with me. Except for swimming pools. They don't catch fire. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Did you see how much we've done? - Yes, but don't forget the buoy. - No. - No. - Cheers. - Cheers. This is what I dreamed of when we were children. To dig out the pool. And then do a backstroke and give the old man a two-fingered salute. - Can't you help me out then? - I am. - I mean with the other stuff. - What stuff? Money. The pay checks. I don't understand, you want me to pay your employees? Yes, that and... Yes. You have more debts. - Yes. - How much? 200,000 should cover most of it. Yeah, 200. Or 350... Even 400. You'll get it back when the will is in order and we do this. My share is worth more than 400,000. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't serious. Take care of the buoy, Lasse. - What are you doing here? - Guess. Are you joking? You've been working together for half a day and you're already enemies. Extremely typical of Lasse. He had no interest in working together. It's never just one thing with him. There's always an ulterior motive. It's stupid of me. He doesn't care about the pool. He wants to borrow money... from me, to pay his employees. - How much? - 40,000 Euros? Are you going to help him? Help him? No. Liv. That's everything we have. - I know, but it's your brother. - He's the one on the edge, not me. He's so close to falling, he'd take me and everything else with him. You can start by telling him why you're here. - Right here? - Here on Åland. Yes. It's the guest house. We inherited the guest house. So you're taking time off from the theatre? - Or? - Yes. You could say that. A pause. Good, let's get started with the scene. - Should I begin with the first scene? - Yes, do that. - Go ahead. - Yes. Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. Hold on. Let's do it again. Be a little more direct. When he opens the door and comes in, you snap at him immediately. - You start like that, then calm down. - I understand. - We'll try again. Go ahead. - Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. Don't you understand that I was worried about you? Again, but a little more low-key. I do everything here at home. I wash up, tidy, clean clothes, everything. Now you have a short fuse... Yes, shorter. You're losing it. I've had enough of this damn... No, don't leave me. You can't leave me. Is this where you're hiding? - I'm not hiding. - You burn down the restaurant and now you're digging a hole so no one will be able to see you. That's what I call hiding. Yeah, I... I'm afraid you came here for nothing. Like I said on the telephone, I won't get the money before September. So you're going to hide here until September? Yeah, I think I'm stuck here. What the hell are you going to do in this hole? Where's your dignity? I have no money, it's as simple as that. Sure you do. Everyone has money somewhere. - But his father died. - I understand. A family tragedy. I understand it takes a toll on you, but as his spiritual guide, you'll have to carry this burden with him. He panicked and buried the body. Am I understanding this correctly? It was never reported to the police? The man buried his father in secrecy? This is not good. Not good at all. Why did you wait until now to tell me? Because this church member... felt that he needed to dig up his father's remains... and throw them into the sea. This is what we'll do. Since he told you this in confidence, you must convince him to turn himself in to the police. It can not stay with you and it can not stay with him. It must come to light. Now, let's see... That one. - So, just go in towards the left. - Thanks. Stay the hell away from her. - Because? - Because she's mine. - Yours? - Yes. Director, movie, lead role. Didn't you turn that down? She wouldn't take no for an answer, so we did an audition. - What if you get the part? - That would be horrible. How awful if I got a lead role. Jonna. Cut it out. The buoy, Lasse. Before their boat crashes into the pier, thanks. - Can't Oskar do it? - No, they asked for you. - I'm working on the pool. - Forget that. It's a fucking buoy. Do it. - What's the problem? - They're not here on vacation. They're not? He... The owner of the boat... I owe him some money. - Some money? How much? - Quite a bit. Enough for him to make the trip. It was the startup capital for the restaurant. - When do you have to pay him back? - It'll be alright. It's fine. - It everything alright? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. Good, then take care of the buoy. Right? - Enough already. I'll do it. - Thanks. It's aluminium. The previous owner designed it himself. Kim. Kim! Cecilia needs help. Go up and help her. - With what? - Just go and help her. - Jump in so we can sort this out. - Bye. Bye. So you're the reason we've come all the way here? How much do you owe? What's this cheap piece of shit? That's all we had. Let Lasse work on that. Stop. I'm stuck. I can't get it loose. - Damn it. - Shit. Help. - Get him up. - It's alright. You're up. Are you alright? It's incredible that you found him. He's much better already. He's breathing normally. Are you okay? You saved his life. He's alive thanks to you. When I saw him go under and disappear... It was like watching myself. As though it was me going under. I always thought I was one of them. I thought I would handle it. Everything is just... Everything I do... falls apart. There's no way out this time. I'm so scared. So fucking scared. I'm so useless. I can't even take my shoes off. Every time. Why do you do this? Where have you been? I've looked all over for you. All night. Do you know how worried I am? - Calm down. - Calm down? So you're standing here, looking. I hope you know the lines now. - What happens next? - I'm not going to help you. - No, I mean with the movie? - Oh. I haven't got the role yet. - How did the audition go? - It went well. What does that mean in Waldemarian? Beyond expectations? It means that it went well. You have to admit, you'd miss me if you get the role. A little. Very little. Miniscule. - You're irritating. - I'll take that as a yes. It's your next line. "You're irritating." You're irritating. What the hell? What if he'd drown out there? And we did nothing. What were we suppose to do? Lasse knew what he was doing. Did he? I know that it's a lot of money, but I think we should lend it to him. What? Yes, he'll pay it back as soon as the inheritance goes through. Have you spoken to Lasse? No. No, I haven't. He says he'll pay, but when the time comes, something else will come up. That's how it is with him. This time he has to save himself. Good night. - Is that your breakfast? - Yes. Hey... Is Rakel still here? Yes, she just called a taxi. - Cancel it, I'll drive her. - You have kitchen duty today? Yes, but it'll be fine. Just let me know when she's ready. Have you seen the shampoo? Thanks. - Anything else? - What? No, nothing. Can you close the door? - Can you turn it off? - Sure. - I don't get it. - What? Your passion is acting, and you struggle along in independent theatres and small stages and anywhere there's an audience. And you end up out here? The natural thing would have been to continue doing what you love. - I have two brothers as well. - Whom are adults. Honestly, I'm just as bewildered as you. I have a theory. People need an entire live to figure out who we really are. Along the way, it's easy to get confused. We can even mix up love and hate. 40,000 euros. Debt. Descending into darkness. Irreparable. - And you're not... - No. No. I don't want to. I can't. - Can't? - No. Oskar. You're the one descending into darkness. You have to start thinking about balance. Balance? I've confessed. Regarding Mauritz. I had to talk to someone. You talked to someone? What did you say? I haven't said anything you need to be worried about. I did it for me. I needed to. You also must choose a path. Otherwise the darkness with spread. We don't want that. Neither you nor I. Balance... Balance. I'll just take the keys. Thank you very much. You'll be moving on? I'm hoping that this... incident, or... That you get over it. Don't worry about it. - Did you want the receipt? - No. You saved my life, but it doesn't cancel your debt. I'll let Kim be, but the money needs to be paid. Now, not later. Of course. - I'll fix it. - Good. Yes? Cold goods are coming. Can you take them? They can't be in the sun. - Yeah, when? - Now. Great. - Everything okay? - Yes. - Absolutely. - Good. Thanks. - Hey? - Yeah? - What the hell should I to do here? - I don't know. You can start with the cold goods. Yes. - Okay? - Yes. Come up so we can go in. Where? - 40,000 euros from savings? - Correct. Okay then. Wait here while I take care of the paperwork. Why did you change your mind? - Did you talk with Liv? - No. - Have you? - No. I need your signature here, then we're done. It's about balance, Lasse. Nothing else, just balance. Thanks, we'll do the rest. I'm glad you called. What happened with the role? Do you want to hear the nice version, or what really happened? Oh. Apparently I'm not one hundred per cent. - One hundred per cent what? - I don't know. One hundred per cent talented or one hundred per cent natural. - Says who? - She does. The director. - The chief will be happy. - Do you think so? Take out the monologue, so we can take a look at it. - Me too. - What? I'm happy. That you're staying. Where have you been? At the bank. Lasse is like a kid on Christmas. He want us to continue with the pool. I can't bare to say no. He want us to do it as brothers. It's silly. But, that's how it is. - It's just one of those days. - Yes. You're so nice. You're too good for them. When are you coming home? I'm just going to finish this play. You are definitely too good for those amateurs. Can we talk later? I'm so tired. Jonna? Is there something... that I should know about? No. No, there's nothing, it's just that I'm so tired and disappointed in it all. - Let's talk later. - Okay. - Kisses. - Kisses. Right. Lasse, I just... - I have to fix something. - What? It'll be quick. I'll be back in half an hour or fifteen minutes, ten minutes. Great. - Hi, Bjarne. It's Lasse. - Hi. I have the money now. Send an account number and I'll transfer it tomorrow. - Every crown. - Yes, every crown. - Good. - Good. Bye. Hi. Hi. - Here. - Thanks. How's it going? You saved his life. What choice did I have? Who were they? Just old shit. - Okay. And it's all settled now? - Yeah, it's all settled. There's a lot of old shit that surfaces out here. You know I still sleep with a nightlight? - No? - Yes. - No... - Yes, it's true. - Really? - Yes. Only children are afraid of the dark. - No, these things can last. - Weird. - Why's that? - It's just strange. It's not so strange. If you get a snakebite as a kid, it's not strange to fear them as an adult. - The dark doesn't bite, does it? - No. I thought the hallways were so creepy. Manne has to turn off the lights for me, it drives him crazy. It would drive me crazy too. I remember I'd go with you when you had to pee every night. What a pain. But you took care of me. I'm happy for that today. I'm happy you're here, Jonna.
