 If we reach out to you and apologise for everything that's happened. Are you prepared to accept it? Go to hell! I KNOW, OSKAR! I KNOW WHAT YOU DID! Get out of here! Go! Typical Lasse. He wants to borrow money - from me to pay the wages. - How much? - 40 000. - Euro? - 40 000, from the savings account. - That's correct. Have you spoken to Liv?

 No. - Have you? - No. Your life is in Stockholm. You shouldn't be here. Are you sure about that? Why are you telling me this? It's Timo who's in custody for setting fire to Lasse's restaurant. The police don't know the link between Timo and Lasse, but I do. And now you do, too. You said that you need this. What has happened? Our... friend... is starting to get worried now. Is that so? Has our friend not calmed down since they found someone else? - Yeah... - But?

 Someone else knows. I received an email. I don't know who sent it. Is there any evidence? It concerns a juvenile, who was acting in self defence. It'll be classed as an accident, and there are no witnesses. But they buried the body, dug it up and then dumped it in the sea. I'm not a juvenile anymore, for Christ's sake! - Think rationally now. - I'm trying. Just because someone knows something, doesn't mean that they know. Do you think mum could have said something? Anna-Lisa didn't even tell me. You're so close now. Don't risk it all by doing something stupid. - Something dumb? - Yeah, like accepting the terms no matter what they are. If there now are any. I'm sorry I messed up. Oskar, is there something else? Have you told me everything? Yes. THICKER THAN WATER Hi. Sorry. Hi. Is everything okay? Copenhagen is so much cooler than Stockholm. And more continental. - Yeah that's what they say. - Who? The Danes. How's mum then? Can you turn that off? Leave it alone for a minute. - I want to listen to some music. - I asked how mum was? You want to know if she has a good job, husband and is doing better now? The answer's yes to all of them. Good. Cool. How's it going with the restaurant? - What do you mean? - I thought, since you didn't fetch me that you were locked up or something. They found the person who did it. So it obviously wasn't me as I'm sitting here. The season's over soon. It's flown by. Yeah. You get that you have to open that right? - This here? - Yeah. - Be careful. - I want to know what you're thinking? - What do you mean? - You always used to confide in me. But I still do that. When are you going to read the play? I will. I promise. I will read it. Who have you told? No one. - You told me. - Yeah, but I know I can trust you. Good. - Could mum have said something? - Yeah, but to who? And why? Why did mum change her will? Why did she invite Jonna and Lasse to the guesthouse without asking me? Why did she commit suicide? There's so many questions. You know why. - You mum was very sick. - Yeah, I know. Think about it. Who could do something like this? - I'll see you later. - So you're not going to eat? No. I'll see you later. Hi. - It's nice that she's home. - Yeah. It's soon over. Yeah, everyone's counting the days. Will you come back? I mean, to visit. Lasse? I need to talk to you. What's it about? The end of the season. What about it? The guesthouse is doing well. Can you sit down? It stresses me out, you standing. Thanks. The guesthouse is doing well, and that... that means that the will go through, so I... I just wanted to talk to you about what will happen next. Yeah, and so the guesthouse is ours. And Jonna's. I just want to be certain that the plan's still that you and Kim are going home. And I can buy you out so that you can pay off your debts. Let's not do this now, before everything's finalised. I just want to be clear... that I'm going to need the money that you owe me. Yeah. I'll pay you back, you don't need to worry. How? What do you mean, how? How exactly will you pay me back, if you don't let me buy you out? - Besides, you have more debts. - I'll take care of it. - We had an agreement. - Oskar, I can't go back. We had an agreement. - I know that we shook on it. - We had an agreement! How the hell will you be able to pay? You owe me and Timo. When your debts are higher than your income. You can't afford to Lasse. When I was beaten up in Mariehamn, all I could think was, never again! I'll never go back to that shit. To them people. Kim doesn't deserve that. She deserves to feel safe, with me. I can do that here, not in Stockholm. We're thinking of staying. I'll write off your debt. I'll write off what you owe me. If you promise to leave here as soon as possible. And let me live my life. What the hell are you up to? - What, have you read it? - What are you thinking? I used your family as a... a metaphor. - I don't name anyone. - What's that got to do with it? - Jonna, this is your role. - No, it's not and there's nothing you can do to convince me. It's not my role. Where's that Jonna who loves to... get her teeth into in a deep, complex, female part like this one? Where is she? You're writing about my family, there's a fucking difference! You know that this is good. You're maybe offended, but everyone is nowadays. - There you go. - Thanks. There you go. Enjoy your meal. What's up? Are you thinking of staying? - Who's said that? - Oskar. Are you thinking of staying? Do you want me to? No, but you understand that it wont work. Why not? I know everything! You killed Mauritz. 30 000 euro and I stay quiet! Of course. We'll be in touch as soon as we find something. Thanks. Bye. The rooms are done. Great. Thanks. Mum said she'd take the little cottage. Cecilia, I have a... I have a little job for you. It's a little delicate. Or, more intricate. Discretion and secrecy are needed you could say. Do I need a dictionary to work out what I'm to do? No. - Take the key to the little cottage. - What should I do there? I want you to look for something. For what? - Lasse has a laptop. - Yeah. I need it. Why? It's important. Can't you get it yourself? Okay, no one... No one would question why you're going in there. You can take in sheets or something. I don't want to. It's important. I wouldn't have asked you otherwise. Do it for me. Hi. We've booked the sauna and would like the key. Of course. One second. Hello? Hi. - Do you smell of whiskey? - No, of course not. Yes you do, I can smell it. What do you have there? What's this? Dad needed it. He said it was really important. We don't go through our guest's things. And not anyone else's either. And we don't drink whiskey. How the hell could you use your daughter like that? How could you? - Wait a little now. - I found her! You don't understand. I had to. What, you had to? Lasse's up to something, I need to know what it is. And for that you used Cecilia? What the hell are you doing? He's trying to cheat me out of our money. Honestly Oskar. Are you going crazy? I know won't understand this. You have a picture of Lasse that... that no one else sees. I see what I see. He's going to inherit a third of the guesthouse, so you'll get your money! It was a good thing that you helped him. - How? - What do you mean, how? How am I going to get my money? I offered to buy his part of the guesthouse. - He accepted, but now I'm not sure. - Don't know what? - If he's going to sell? - He said he's thinking of staying. Yeah, well don't drag Cecilia in in your paranoia. - We're alone. - Nice. - How was Copenhagen? - It was good. - Have you missed me? - Of course. - How much? - Loads. - What are you thinking about? - Copenhagen. - Was it tough? - Mum likes it. What about you? She only has time for herself and her job. You know what the strangest thing while I was away? - I really missed Dad. - Just him? No, of course not! I heard that they found your dad. How does it feel? I don't know. I didn't know him. We never had a relationship. So I don't know how I should feel. Fredrik? Are you home? Fredrik? - When do I see you next? - I'll fix something. Hurry up. Are you sleeping? Yeah. I was tired. Yeah, yeah. Kim? Kim? Yeah. I just wanted to see if you were here. What are you doing? Unpacking the bags. Are you off out? Erm... no. I thought we could eat at seven. Okay. - Hi. How are you? - Hi. I can't talk about it now. What are you doing? Working. I can see that something's up. Has your dad ever asked you to do something... totally wrong? Yeah, to live here all summer. But now you have Fredrik. Yeah. Do you want to come sailing? I have to work. - You're always working. - Yeah, I know. Who'd be angrier if you didn't turn up? - Dad. - Then it's fine, right? Did you not see, the post's arrived. Was there anything for me? No. Hello? I'm sorry about that with Cecilia. It was... Yeah, I... It's her you should talk to, not me. Yeah, I'll talk to her. Anything else? No. - I know what you're up to. - Excuse me? I know that it's you. Have you too much free time, Mildred? Sitting at home, making up loads of stuff. Sending emails and conspiring. Are you drunk? - Was it her who told you? - What are you talking about? - What are you doing? - Where is it? I know that it's you, where is it? - Where's the computer? - What computer? I know that it's you. Tell me where it is? I don't own a computer. You're lying! - Oskar, get out. - No, I'm going to find it. Oskar, listen to me. I don't own a computer. I'd like you to leave now. We could sail out to Märket. - What's that? - It's the worlds smallest island. - Are you serious? - It's really nice. - Where abouts is it? - Over there, through the fog. - Can we sail there? - No worries. We'll sail through it. - You can't see anything. - No. We need to go back. Turn the boat around. - We can't. It's too far. - We need to get to land. What should we do? Trying to find land. Shit. - Shit. - What's happened? - The rudder's not doing anything. - What? I can't steer. But we have to get home. - What should we do? - I'll try to steer us towards Märket. Hi, it's me. I need money. - Has something happened? - Did you not hear me? I need to borrow some money. 30 000 euro for his silence. I need to borrow money. Do you understand? - Calm down. - Yeah... but I have to... I have to pay! Listen to me. Be rational. What could this person have seen? You asked me if there was anything else to tell. - What is it? - Have you seen Kim? No. - She didn't come home for dinner. - She's probably with Fredrik. With Fredrik? What, Mildred's son? Why is she with him? Lasse, do you have no idea? Obviously not. Do you want to come with me? I'm going to take a walk. - What, you mean... they're together? - Yeah. - Really? - Would it calm you down if I lied? Shit. - Maybe Cecilia knows where she is? - Yeah, possibly. She should be working in reception, but she's staying away. Mum and Dad aren't that popular today. That sounds familiar. It's starting to get foggy. Should we go back? You know it's not possible. You can't stay here. It's not possible. I can't go back to Stockholm. I can't go back to that life. Never again. Seriously Lasse, what are you going to do here? What are you doing here? What do you mean? Where's the Liv who wanted to get away from Åland and see the world? All the plans we had? Everything we wanted to do? She probably grew up. Lasse, we talked about cycling around Gotland. Yeah, amongst other things. Everyday life isn't as bad as you think. No, I know. That's why I want ta stay. Come on, I want to show you something. - No, come on, what? - Come, come. Lisa Karjala... Yep, you've already payed. - Really nice to have you here. - Thanks a lot. - Welcome back. - Thanks. Hi. Good evening dear guest. You look like you need a room. I'll see if we have a free room. That are you doing in reception? At this guesthouse it appears the guests are required to work. - Where's Liv? - No idea. - I was commandeered to be here. - What about Cecilia? She should be working. You seen her? No, je ne sais pais. I'm just a simple theatre jester. Actor... - Hi. - Liv, are you nuts? You can't let Manne interact with the guests in reception. - He scares the guests. - Cecilia and Kim are missing again. I don't know where they are. Most probably with Fredrik. Has Cecilia rang? She's not answering her phone. No, I don't know where she is. Where are you? - I'm out looking. - What about Lasse? Where's he? He's out looking after Kim somewhere. - Okay, so he's not with you? - No. It was Oskar. Cecilia's not been in touch. - This was mum's. - Mmm. Her secret place. "Nothing compares to singing." At least we're out of the fog. I don't have any signal. Do you have signal? Where the hell is my mobile? No! I left it charging at home. But how are we... The boat's tethered. There's no chance of sailing home. The rudder's totally broken. Do you mean we have to stay here? What else can we do? Swim back? - We need to ring. - Do you have any signal? No, nothing. Dad's gonna go crazy. He is already. Mine too. It's in the genes. Yeah, but my dad's different. Everything must be... under control. Is that why you do everything he says. If he says "hop", you hop? Yeah, well he didn't burn down his own restaurant. It wasn't him who did it. And you're waiting for big, strong Oskar to come and save you. Lasse's no Superman, if you think that. At least you have a dad who can come and save you. So this is where you are? Hi. Can you come up to us. I'm not really in the party mood. You were brilliant tonight. As always. Thanks. Can we go somewhere and have a glass of wine? Why would I want to go and have a glass of wine with you? Because... it's the last chance. Because you're leaving, because... it's over. Because I don't want us to part on bad terms. She never thought acting was a proper profession. She thought that the theatre was only for dreams. We never reconciled, Mum and I. I was too angry with her. I hated that she'd dragged me out here again. And then afterwards... I hated how she'd just dumped the guesthouse on us. - Typical of her to dictate the terms. - Hmm. Yeah, I recognise myself in that. Being forced into... the family business. Did you reach anyone? No. It's hopeless. I have no signal at all. But, I tried to send an SMS. I'm so hungry. What happens now? It's from Cecilia. Cecilia got in touch. She's okay. They're out on Märket. Märket? What are they doing there? I don't think they meant to get stuck. The rudder broke. The rudder? So they're with Fredrik? You need to go out there to get them. Lasse's probably worried about Kim. You sure you don't want me to drive all the way up? Yeah, it's okay. We shouldn't tempt fate. Yeah... Goodbye Mikael. Good luck with your career. The same. - I love you. - What did you say? Nothing. "...to be despised, but I will create my own race of people." "The race of a comic super-people that will conquer..." - Hi. - Hello. - It was room eight? Here you go. - Thanks. What are you doing in reception? I thought I'd give the hotel business a try. If you can't beat them, join them. How do you think it's going? It's going alright. How was the last night with the gang? Good. And the closing party? - Cool. - Cool. Who was there? Everyone. - I'm going up to have a shower. - Okay. Kim? Kim? - Have you read it again? - Yeah. And? What's the verdict? It's good. And err... the lead roll? You know I could do this roll in my sleep. But I'm not going to stand up there and darken the name of my family and let people see all our open wounds. That's what artists do. Art is the lie that helps us see the truth. Can you stop with all the clichés. What does it matter that it's based on your family? It should have feeling. It should hurt. Change things. I've been asked to show the play now in the autumn. The premiere's in September and I want to come back with me. Now. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm freezing. - Okay. Yeah. - Yeah. Thanks. You could have said before you left. Everything happened so fast. I wanted to see Fredrik. What the hell were you thinking? Huh? How could you take them out in this weather? In this fog? Huh? - Dad. - Oskar, calm down. Fucking Pahkinen! It wasn't his fault the fog came in. It was my idea. The rudder broke. There's a thing called sea forecast. Heard of them before? Oskar, not now. What happened? The rudder broke, but we managed to sail here. The important thing is, you're okay. We can fix the boat another day. Let's go home. Sit in the back. Don't you understand, I worry about you? Yeah, but I don't normally forget my mobile. It was lucky that Cecilia had hers with her. And that I was with Liv when she rang. We wondered where you were. - Hello. - Hi. - What terrible weather. - Yeah. Thanks. - Is anyone else coming? - No you can drive. Stop. She's coming. Let the meter run, she's coming. It worked out in the end. Yeah. - It could be fixed. - Good. Are you certain about this? I have the money. What happens now? Send email
