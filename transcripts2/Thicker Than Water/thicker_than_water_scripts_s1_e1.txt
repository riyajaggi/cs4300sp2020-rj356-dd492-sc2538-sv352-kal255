 Please... THICKER THAN WATER Is that all she wrote? "Please be here when we open for the season. Important, Anna-Lisa." Is that how you speak to each other? Apparently. When were you last there? - I don't recall. - When did you last see any of them? No idea. - Was this all you got? - Yes. And two tickets. - So where are the tickets? - Shit!

 Hi. - Hi! Weren't you off to Åland? - I forgot something. - Hi! - Stressful, eh? Is Lasse here? - No, he's got the day off. - Are you lying to me? - No, no, no... - So where is he? - Tell me where he is. - At home, maybe? Stop, you pansy! Sorry! Sorry! I didn't see it was you! - Take it easy. - It's cool. Having a hard time, are you? No, it's all good. It's just that... Is something not clear? - I've been looking for you. - Shit, no. I get it. I just...

 - I don't know, I just... - Good. Fine. As long as we get the money. We can trust each other, right? Absolutely, of course. I swear... Excuse me... - Your daughter? - Yes. Kim, right? Funny name for a girl, I think. Kim. Isn't that a boy's name? Kim. Kim, Kim, Kim. Bjarne, I promise to get you the money. It's OK, it's OK, we'll work it out. - Right! - Where did you get to? - Pretty flash! - Good, eh? Theatre, theatre... Damn good job, Bengt. Fantastic monologue. Great stuff. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - You were the star, as usual. - Knock it off! - Cheers! - Thanks. Cheers! If the critics aren't overwhelmed, I'll kill myself! I'm so sweaty... - It was so fucking good! - And the house was packed! When will you be back? In one, max two days, maybe? I'll have to hear what the old lady has to say. - But tonight we'll celebrate. - Of course. It's going to be a hit! I won't hold a long speech. I just want to say that... ...it's been a fantastic journey, thanks to the god of drama up there. Dionysus, we did it! Cheers! - I promise you! - Don't, Mum. - It's true. - Stop it. - Ready to go, Mårtensson? - Of course, Oskar! Mum? There you are. So, everything's ready. Even Mårtensson's here. Thank you, Oskar. Very good. We might even have time for a coffee beforehand. - I don't know... - Tea, then? I'll let you and your family run things today, Oscar. What? But we're opening today. Now. I'm staying here. - Here? - Yes. See that house there? I was always getting into scraps with the kid living there. Every summer! See those woods there? - We got lost there once. - It's only a clump of trees, Dad! I was only seven. BOARDING HOUSE - Are you OK? - I just have to pull over for a bit. Dad? Dad! Come. I want to show you something. There should be a path here somewhere. Here somewhere. Here. Beautiful, eh? I used to come here as a kid. There's a flat rock here that makes a perfect seat. Jonna! - Hi! - Hi! What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - We were just driving by. I wanted to show Kim... Do you recognise...? - Do you remember me? - Of course I do! Aunt Jonna, right? - I can't believe you're here! - Well... I thought it was about time. Mum just got in touch. Said it was important. And, well, she's not getting any younger. I was just showing Kim my old hunting grounds. - I had no idea you'd be here. - Me neither, really. But Mum got in touch with me, too. She sent a dramatic postcard telling me to be here. - No, thanks. I've quit. - Good boy. - Have you spoken to Oskar? - No. - Have you? - No. - Do you know what this is all about? - No idea. I was thinking maybe I'll just sit here for a bit... ...and then take a taxi back to the ferry and go home. - Maybe that's not a bad idea. - No. Go on, I'll have a cig. Sure. How long can we sit here for? Ten? Twenty? Let's say thirty. Have you noticed anything strange with Grandma today? Like what? I don't know. Something that made you think "I must tell Dad at once". - Like what? - I don't know. Hello, hello? - Hi! Why, if it isn't...? - Cecilia. No! Wow! How big you've grown! Hi! It's been ages. What are you doing here? - Didn't Mum tell you I was coming? - Mum? No... What? Funny. Lasse's here too. Is Lasse here? - Hi! Hello! - Hi. Lasse! Hi. This is Kim, my daughter. Hello. At last! Hello, Mum. My babies! Together again at last. That's Kim, my daughter. - Kim, say hello to your grandmother. - Hello. What's going on? I'm afraid there's not much more to Grandma than what you see here. That's OK. There's not much more to Kim, either. How's the restaurant, Lasse? Fine. We're almost fully booked. - And Jonna. More beautiful than ever. - Stop it. - Are you well? - Yes. We who live here have always loved this opening day. And having you here makes it better than ever. Right, Oskar? I've prepared the cottage for you and Kim, Lasse. And you, Jonna, will stay in your favourite room upstairs. I also have an announcement to make and I think today's the right day. - Is it serious, Mum? - We'll talk about that later. Maybe now's best, before the guests arrive. After dinner. Let's open! - I'll handle this. - Kim, could you get the bags? - Are you kidding me? - Just bring them over here. Hey! Where are you? Dad's coming! - Jonna! - Hello, Daddy! Pumpkin! Take these to the kitchen. - Have you seen Mum? - No. - I'm heading over to the cottage. - OK. Do you want to give me a hand with my bike? - What do you need help with? - It's stuck! - It's not stuck. You're just joking! - No! It's what we do out here! Come in! Room service! - Hi. - Hi. How kind! You haven't changed a bit since you left. Haven't I? You didn't need to bring sheets. You don't have a key to the linen closet. The last I heard you were married. Yeah... but divorced. She lives in Copenhagen these days., - You have a lovely daughter. - Thanks. You too. Thanks. And the restaurant? It's going... We're doing well. Really well. I can't complain. Oh, sorry. The place looks great. Thanks. Do you think it's changed much? Well, perhaps not as much as I thought. But it's lovely, really lovely. You've really taken good care of it. There you go, room service over. Thanks. This is when you're supposed to say I haven't changed either. Know what, Liv? I don't recognise you at all. - See you at dinner then. - Liv, listen. What's this all about? What are we doing here? No idea. Don't ask me. - Timo. - It's me. I've been waiting for you to call. I'm on Åland now. - What do you say? - Let's do it. - Just this? - Yeah. I got one just like it, too. Two postcards. "Please be here when we open for the season. Important, Anna-Lisa." Did she hint at what could be this important? We haven't spoken to her. - How is she? Could she be sick? - No, no... She's older, sure, but she's as tough as old boots. I thought she might need help with the kitchen. - The kitchen? - I'm sorry. Revamp the restaurant, fresh ideas. It all looks a bit dated out here. So you figured she wanted your help? Yes, so what? What's so...? What the hell is it? - This is more serious than I thought. - Oskar, you're being paranoid. When was the last time either of you met Mum? Can you even claim to know her any more? Do you have the slightest clue what it's like for us out here? You never call. You've no idea how hard we work. How hard Mum works. - Hello. - Hello. Mum... Hi, Petra. Thank you for coming at such short notice. Petra, please, you have to help me. Give me something. Why did Mum ask Lasse and Jonna to come here, today of all days? Then she visits the lawyer and then she visits you. You. What's going on? Does this stain show? Jesus! Something's going on, and I'm being kept completely in the dark. Yes or no? You mean the coffee stain? And Liv? What does she say? About what? Well, about Lasse being back. Petra... Petra... Blink if something's up. Is Mum up to something I should know about? - So how's school? - Good. Lasse, at that age you hate such questions. - Really? - Yes. Kim? "Hate" is an understatement. - Do you hate that question? - No. She's lying. Do you remember that summer when you had to spoon-feed Oskar? When he helped build that stone wall and a rock landed on his hands. - Remember, honey? - It was terrible. Lasse had to feed me. - I never had to feed you. - You did. Even I remember that. You were whining about doing women's work. No way, I never said that. "Women's work"? And you shoved big chunks in my mouth just to get it over and done with. - I don't remember any of it. - Sure you do! His hands were as big as footballs, and his mouth was stuffed with food like this... It was a slow death experience every time. I was convinced you were trying to kill me. The only one who tried to kill anyone here was Dad. I'm sorry, but that's how he was. But what if he's alive? I wonder where he could be. - He's dead. - Says who? - Common sense. - OK, but you can't be sure. Maybe he's pissed in a bar somewhere or on some banana boat... Jonna, he's dead. Remember that slap he'd give us? We called it the ping-pong something. The "ping-ping palm". It could sting for a whole day. He'd flick his hand like he was adding top-spin. Get you right above the ear. - They're exaggerating. - You were too little. - It'd come flying like this... - No, you have to angle it. Right. And then whack! Where the hell did he learn that? He picked it up on his way up from hell. My God, stop it. Why are you exaggerating like this? - He's not. - It was a top-spin. Enough, Lasse. - Exactly. He'd flick his wrist... - Lars. And if he was really mad, he'd deliver a backhand... Stop it! That will do! We get it. I've summoned you here because I'd like to talk to the three of you. Jonna, Lasse and Oskar. - I want to see you one at a time. - About what? When I've said my piece you may do as you like. Stay here or go home, it's up to you. - So you want to talk, just like that? - Yes. So who's first? Lasse, the eldest? I'll start with you, Oskar. After dinner. Now let's eat. So, now you're the little brother again. You never used to fight when you were kids. We're not fighting. We just don't get together. You did when you were kids. Because there were no other kids around here. You probably think your old mum's lost her marbles. So much so that you need to spy on her in Mariehamn. If only you'd just lost your marbles. That I could accept. But this? - This? - Jonna and Lasse. You summon them here behind my back, without consulting me. Am I mistaken? Or who's been running this boarding house? - We have, of course. - You and I. - Yes, and Liv. - Exactly. Liv. And not once have I made a decision behind your back. - No, not that I'm aware of. - All this has been built on trust. Yes, Oskar, and I'm deeply grateful for it. You know, I consider myself very lucky and that's thanks to you and your family. - I wouldn't want to change anything. - No? - Not at all. - And yet you summon them here. This is my home too, Mum. And my family's. Lasse... - I'm married to Liv, now. - Dear Oskar, please... You worry and speculate and think too much. You always have. No, I'm thinking for the both of us. That's what makes this thing work. - They're only your siblings. - If so, why didn't you tell me? Because they're also my children. I don't need permission to see them. You had no right to go behind my back, Mum. You're not doing it again, do you hear me? Can I speak now? I want you to accept what I'm about to say... ...and I want you to understand that it's important. You must forgive. Did you hear me? - That I have to forgive? - Yes. - What do you mean? - Exactly what I say. That you have to forgive. Forgive who? Or what? - Was that it? - Yes. That's it. Forgive? - Don't ask me. - Forgive who? I don't know, and I probably never will. Did you change the oil? We have to flip the canoe, it could rain. - Everything's taken care of. - Do you think Mum's losing her mind? Did you see the note about the Virtanens? They need a cot in 5. Oskar. Oskar! Sit down. Breathe. OK. I can't remember if it was the 17th or 18th... The 17th. He's the same, isn't he? Lasse. Charlie's having a party in 3 days. We'll be home by then, right? Sure, we won't be staying here that long. What are we doing here? I'm not so sure any more. Did you really think you were going to fix the kitchen routines? Yeah. So what? Open up! Is the boy at home? I assume you already know. How you managed to get Jonna and Lasse out here is beyond me. I'm putting things right. Fixing what's broken. I'm giving you a chance to say what your piece. Here I am. Now's your chance. Tell me what you want. What I want? What you want. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Rested? - No, thanks. Could you come with me later? I could do with some help. Help with what? I'm collecting a delivery at Kärringsundet. I think you'd like it. - By delivery, you mean fish? - I mean dinner. Yes? Thanks. Need a hand? Want to hear something crazy? It's more fun seeing you than my siblings. Yes, that's crazy. - I'm not sure what that means. - That you don't get on. What's this? "Call the tourist agency. Get quote from painter. Book buses." - You're doing all that today? - Yes. Can I join you? - Sure, OK. - Cool. - Here you go. - Shellfish? Yep. - When did we put those on the menu? - They were on special offer. It'll be nice for the opening. - So how are you going to serve it? - In a plateau. It was Lasse's idea. Sure. Great. Make sure we have ice. We'll have to bring out the platters too. Shellfish plateau. Come in. So, my turn? Come here. When you were little I'd stand here and watch you all playing outside. Can you tell me a little about Kim? - She's like any teenager, I guess. - And what's that like? Stroppy, grumpy, secretive. Sometimes disappears with her mobile turned off. Her friends are the same. I never know when she's coming home. Hopeless. And now you don't want me to tell you it'll pass. - Oskar isn't over it, is he? - Over what? Liv. That we were together. I hope so. - Are you? - Over Liv? Definitely. No. I mean that Oskar took her from you. Are you over that? - Yeah. - Because I wasn't sure you'd come. - Come here? Why wouldn't I? - I just wasn't sure. - What, do you want me to leave? - Absolutely not. No? I just want you to tell me... the reason why you came. Why did you come, Lasse? Well, Mum... you wrote me a postcard. You said you had something important to say. It just doesn't feel like the only reason. You're always full of plans. What was your plan this time? I have no plans. I don't get you. Plans that don't always pan out the way you want. OK... But perhaps you've learned that by now? - Am I hear to talk about my future? - No, no. They why are we talking about it? You're avoiding the question of why you're here. You know what, forget it. It just feels... There now, Lasse. Sit down. I have something I want to tell you. I apologise. Do you accept my apology? Ready? Yes. You have to take care of them. - What? - You have to take care of them. Take care of who? - Mum, please... - That was all. OK, Mum. OK. I'll take care of them. Hey. You'll have to pack now., We're heading off tomorrow. Hey, come on. Start packing. Come on, Kim. I'm not doing your packing for you. Hear me? I'm disturbingly like Mum in that picture. - I'm sorry. - For what? I'm an actor. I love attention. - I think you're great. - You're just saying that. - No! I think you're great! - And how would you know that? - Luleå's far away. - There are flights, you know. What do you mean? - Have you flown up to Luleå? - Yes, with Grandma. - Have you and Mum come to see me act? - Yes. In what? - "The Imaginary Invalid." - What? - That was actually good. - I know! Why didn't you come backstage and say hello? Did you go straight back? Why? OK... I get it. - What are you looking for? - Oh, sorry. Nothing. No, don't get up, Jonna. Look in the second drawer from the top. The file there. It's an old hiding place of Mauritz's. One of them. Cheers. What's your boyfriend called? - Manne. - And you met at work? Yes. He's a director. So he tells you what to do and you obey him? That sounds more like your generation. - How was the premiere? - Good. I read everything I can about you. Do you? I didn't think you cared any more after you quit. But when it comes to you, I do. You don't say. I read everything I can get my hands on. Perhaps you should bring Cecilia up sometime. - She seems interested. - Can't you bring Manne here instead? - That'll be hard. I can't. - Why not? Fresh air gives him anxiety attacks. You get used to it. Why are we talking about him? No particular reason. I'm just interested in your well-being. You should move back home. Home? - You think I should live here? - Yes. You're kidding me. What would I do here? Out of you three, I've always considered you the Ålander. But I'm not. So you can forget that. - Are you sure? - Yes. Not in the slightest. - I'm more the exact opposite. - Maybe. Maybe not. I thought we were past this. Can't you... It'd be so nice if you for once said: "Jonna, I'm so pleased you're doing so well. I'm so proud of you." Is it so hard? Is it so deeply buried in you that you can't give me that? OK, now I know. Just because you gave up your career, you take it out on me? That's insane. I have more important things to say. I'm bursting with curiosity. You are not me. You are not me. - OK, that was it, was it? - Yes. And now I'm supposed to work out what that means? Is that it? Mum, you could've said that on the phone. You could've written that on the postcard. You called me here to hear you say that? I was interested in your reaction. - OK. Are we done here now? - Yes. Thanks. Not a bloody word about seeing me act! And I know she has! That's how she is. I act like a bloody teenager as soon as I get here. She drives me up the wall! - What did she mean, you're not her. - I don't know! It's some fucking puzzle she wants me to solve. She thinks it's fun. - What are you going to do? - I don't know. There's a ferry at nine. If I pack now I can make it. Shall I pick you up from the airport? - Listen... - Yes? - Am I any good? - Jonna, you're... - Jonna, I love you. - Cut it out. Be honest! Jonna, you know. You're the best. You know that. - Get packing and I'll meet you, OK? - OK. - Lasse... - How's your weekend break? - Hi, Bjarne. - Don't forget our agreement. - We'll be starting a new week soon. - It's cool. I have a plan. OK. This is your last chance, Lars Waldemar. Hear me? It's cool, I... I think I'll turn in. - Good night. - Good night. Good night... Good night, sweetheart. ANNA-LISA Lasse! Come. Have you seen Mum? - She's not in her room. - We've looked. You've been in her room? Mum? Mum? Are you there, Mum? We're coming in. - What's that? - I don't know... My darling children. Nothing saddens me more than the realisation I couldn't protect you when you were little. I was your mother and I let you down. But that doesn't mean you have to dislike each other. A difficult task therefore now awaits you. So difficult that I can only hope you'll manage it. If not... ...we'll at least have done all we can to put the past behind us. Your mother, Anna-Lisa.
