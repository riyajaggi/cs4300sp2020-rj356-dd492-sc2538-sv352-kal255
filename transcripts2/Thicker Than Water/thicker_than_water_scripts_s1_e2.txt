 Sorry! Sorry! - As long as we get the money. - Absolutely. Of course. - Was this all you got? - Yes. And two tickets. When will you be back? In one, two days max? I'll have to hear what the old lady has to say. There's a flat rock here that makes a perfect seat. Jonna! What are you doing here? - At last! - Hi, Mum. My babies. Together again at last. Two postcards. Did she hint at what could be this important?

 This is when you're supposed to say I haven't changed either. Know what, Liv? I don't recognise you at all. I thought you wanted to kill me! The only one murdering anyone was Dad. - What if he's alive? - He's dead. - Says who? - Jonna... He's dead. - It's me. I'm on Åland now. - What do you say? Let's do it! Have you seen Mum? Anna-Lisa's cancer was already far gone when she came to see me. She wouldn't have made it through the summer. I think she wanted to spare you. That was why she kept her condition to herself.

 When someone passes away like this, it can bring up a lot of emotions. It's important then to be close to your loved ones. You should be happy that you have each other. This... This letter she left... "So a very difficult task now awaits you, so difficult that I can only hope you're up to it." What does she mean? I don't know. She never mentioned it to me. Beatrice, did she mention anything? What did she say? Anna-Lisa's wish was that... ...her will be opened right after the funeral. Then all will be explained. You must be able to tell us something? Sorry. - Nothing? - As I said. Wait until the funeral. THICKER THAN WATER They're looking for you. So it's time. What about the neighbour? Is she the same? She hardly speaks to us. She still blames us for her husband's death? Seems like it. - So everyone's stuck in the past? - More or less. Shall we? Well? - You're kidding, right? - What's wrong with this? - Whose was it originally? - Cecilia's. - Come on... - You come on. Go and get changed. Just be quick... - Bjarne. - Hi, it's Lasse. It's sorted. Good. I'll send someone round to collect the money. Could you wait a couple of days? It's an inheritance and there's paperwork to do. - How many days? - Two or three. A week, max. - OK. - Thanks. - Does your phone have a top-up card? - No. There you go! You look great. Well, dear friends. Time to go inside. - What are you doing here? - Taking farewell of Anna-Lisa. - Mildred, that's not possible. - Is the church so full? - I'm not going to let you in. - Of course you will, Oskar. It's your mother. I knew her before you were born. The boy can come in if he wants to, but not you. - Oskar... - Come on, Mum. Let's forget it. - Oskar Waldemar, shame on you. - Come on. Hello. - What is it? - Nothing. Hello. After coffee we'll get together for the reading of the will. I hardly had time to say hello, she just took off. She could have waited. - Waited for what? - For us to be back on good terms. Did you have a row? So did we. We're gathered here today to pay our last respects to Anna-Lisa Waldemar and to commend her to the hands of God. We shall now join together in singing one of Anna-Lisa's favourite hymns... Sorry. I'm really sorry about that. Sorry. Please forgive me. I'm so sorry... It won't happen again. Hymn 297, "Fairest Lord Jesus". Fairest Lord Jesus Ruler of all nature Thee will I cherish Stop that, Cecilia! Get a grip. Hold it, hold it! - What's the matter? - Is Mum really going to lie here? - What do you mean? - Next to the Pahkenens? - What are you talking about? - It's not on. - Come on, Oskar, it's just a hole. - I won't have it. Isn't it time to bury the hatchet? If you bury Mum here, I'll come back and dig her up. - What hatchet? - It's nothing. There's another site. We can use that one. Hey, what was the fight about? Bye bye! Push me out! - My condolences. - Thank you. So the funeral was today? Shouldn't this wait? Why? It's about the loan. The will's being read today. I want things to be in order by then. It's not that we don't trust you Oskar, but it's a big investment. Everything needs to be in place. We don't consider the main building to be of particularly high value. It needs a lot of work, and that reduces the value. But the business is lucrative and it's all financially healthy. And the waterside plot pushes up the price. To...? All in all, we arrive at a market value of... ...two million euros. Which is a low estimate. You'll need 1.3 million euros to buy out your siblings. As you said, the business is thriving. So everything's under control. When are we heading home? We'll stay for the reading of the will and then we can escape. - To Mum. - Cheers. It's going to cost more for the sexton to move the gravestone. Of course. That won't be a problem. - How are you? - I'm doing fine. As long as I get a normal cup of coffee... I think it's empty. I'll go and refill it. - Mum never said what was going on? - No. Nothing at all? She only told me about her cancer and her funeral arrangements. I got the loan commitment, at least. - Already? - Two million for the lot. That's a lot of money. - Thank you. - I'll take care of this later. Oh, sorry! - Don't say we have to wash up too? - Rather in here than out there. They don't care that Grandma's dead. But what if someone with herpes has... Oh well, here goes... Thank you all for coming. Kiitos että tulitte. So. Our mother has finally left us. I'd like to... I'd just like to explain what Anna-Lisa, Mum, has meant to me and above all our beloved boarding house. A boarding house that's been not only an employer over the years but also a sanctuary for all those who... What about Mauritz? Your father and my brother. - Don't forget him. - No, Konrad. This isn't your mother's handiwork alone, is it? Your father did his fair share. God rest his soul. But after all, this is Mum's funeral. When are you ever going to show my brother some respect? Easy now, Konrad. When the hell are you going to erect a tombstone for him? - Uncle Konrad, let's just calm down. - Get your hands off me. Thank you, Lasse. Now where was I? Yes, I was talking about that island that... I don't know if I have much more to say other than that Anna-Lisa would have been happy and grateful to see so many of you hear today. - To Anna-Lisa. - Anna-Lisa. You've reached Timo. Speak after the beep. Hi, it's Lasse. There's been a change of circumstances. I have an inheritance coming my way so we're calling it off. Don't set fire to the restaurant. Call me back and confirm. Bye. Nice speech. You didn't even hear it. No, but it sounded good anyway. So, what are you going to do? - With what? - Your share. - You fancy it? - A bit. - You want Jonna's as well? - Maybe. You'll have to pay us equally. If I raise the value, Jonna has to get the same. Of course I'll pay you the same. We'll handle this correctly. What's the market value? 1.5 million... ...provided we find the right buyer. What do you say? Five million Swedish kronor. Tempting? What's happening with the pool? We've done a lot of work on the place. If I stay a while longer, I could renovate it. - Not a good idea. - Why not? The cement. It's 40 years old. It'll leak like a sieve. Are you still sulking because I left before it was done? I'm just saying it's a bad idea. - You don't want a pool? - I don't want you around. "My darling children. If all has gone to plan, you're all sitting together listening to Beatrice reading you this letter. And you've also found the letter I left you. I want you to hold on to it for the rest of your lives. The will that I'm leaving behind will shock you deeply but bear in mind my intent is not malicious. I have therefore decided that the boarding house and its grounds will be transferred to you on one, and only one condition. And rest assured that this condition is irrevocable. From this day until the boarding house closes in September, the three of you will run it together. You will have joint responsibility for its day-to-day operations. If you report healthy finances in September you are free to do whatever you please with the business. But should you fail in this or forego the condition, the business will be sold and the proceeds donated to charity. Good luck, your mother, Anna-Lisa Waldemar." What bullshit! We are direct heirs. This is illegal, you know that. There must be a law against disinheriting your children! Yes, but only if you have ownership. - What do you mean? - She didn't own the boarding house. When she became ill, her first act was to give it away. The new owner is contractually bound to sell it back to you for 1 euro provided that you jointly manage the business successfully this season. And who did she give it to? - Me. - You? - So all this is yours? - Reluctantly, yes. If you fail in this, or if you refuse this agreement, I must donate the entire property in September. To? The Classic Boat Enthusiasts' Society. For God's sake! - Anna-Lisa liked rowing boats. - Jesus Christ! A bunch of boat nerds inherits this whole fortune? - That's right. - For fuck's sake! I agree, but these are the rules. If we're supposed run this place for a season, what exactly are the rules you've made up for us? Anna-Lisa made the rules up. To prevent you from cheating. - Cheating? - Yes. Like leaving the island. - We can't leave? - No, not for more than 24 hours. - Can we leave the premises at all? - For business reasons, of course. I mean, you're not prisoners. How long have you been the owner of the boarding house? Three years. We're drafting an agreement that you'll need to sign. Have you and Anna-Lisa kept quiet about this for three years? - I understand how you feel. - You understand nothing, Beatrice! I suggest that you take the rest of the day to think it over. Then I'll come back tonight and you can tell me... ...what you've decided. Shall we do that? I'm sorry, Oskar. - Hello! - Just a moment... - I'm still waiting for my room. - Are you? Let's see... Room number 14. Here. Well, what did she say? Beatrice. How'd it go? Yes, well... Not quite as expected. No? That's nice... Shit... I was having such a nice dream! It was about a ladybird. But the thing was that the ladybird could speak. It could only tell lies. And every time it lied its nose grew, like Pinocchio's. What's up? Aren't you going to pack? - I don't know. - What do you mean, "don't know"? - I think... I'll be staying. - You think? - OK, I suspect... - That you'll be staying? - We. - No way! You promised we'd go home! We stayed for the funeral, and that was an extra week. You had paperwork to do then we'd get the ferry. Look. You can blame your grandmother, not me. Her will has imposed... ...unexpected conditions. We have until tonight to decide. - What time? - Nine. We can catch the night ferry. But if we agree to your grandmother's wishes... ...we'll be here a little longer. What, one or two days? A week? - A month? - Until September. Are you stupid? You and me here until September? - What about the restaurant? - We'll work something out. - Like what? - I don't know, Kim, OK? - We're all in shock here! - You just don't care about me. You say September and expect me to live with it. You've decided. Fuck! - Have you heard? - No. Everyone's just all frantic. Have you got any money? Shit! - You should give up. - There have been twelve cars so far. Maybe that's it for the day. - Will you come and visit me? - If you want. - Sure I do, we're second cousins. - Cousins. Same difference. - Can't you just forget it? - One more, then I will, OK? Yes! - What about the money? - What money? The money I'll get if I stay. - What about it? - It's a lot of money. What, is your theatre salary not good enough? Sure it is... But if I stay and get the money I won't have to accept crappy parts. Crappy parts? Good parts come with hard work, not with an inheritance. Nurture your talent, not your wallet. Go live, go live! Berlin 1961. There is still only barbed wire that you can jump over... ...but they'll start building the wall in a few days and all attempts to escape will be futile. This isn't the time for Cold War nostalgia. You think you can stay till September and simply return? - You'll end up stuck here. - I don't know, but... Listen. Don't get trapped in East Berlin. The 3 o'clock ferry is your last chance to jump the barbed wire. Look, you take the 3 o'clock ferry. I'll stay here and talk to them. OK? Then I'll hide in the boot of a Lada and slip out via Checkpoint Charlie. OK? - A Trabant. - What? You're in East Berlin, not Moscow. You'll hide in a Trabant, not a Lada. - Bye. - Bye. - Love you. - Love you, too. - See you soon. - Sure. See you! - Bjarne. - Hi, Bjarne, it's Lasse. - Look... that inheritance I was due... - Yes? I just wanted to say that it's still there, it's all good. - OK. - But can you wait till September? Because we can't get access to the money until then. You got a week. That's it. September is out of the question. What you will do, Lasse, is come back and repay your debt. - You have one last week. - It's OK, I get it. I'll sort it out. You've reached Timo. Speak after the beep. What was that? - Eh? - Looked like you threw away a mobile. - It was a stone. - It looked like a mobile. My mobile's here. What did Manne say about you staying? Is that what I'm doing now? Well, you didn't catch the night ferry. No... Thanks. What do we do? What are our options? Apart from giving the boat club an early Christmas present. - We just have to accept. - No, that's not an option. It'll never work. The three of us here until September? People have killed for less. It'll never work. Can't we try to trick her somehow? How? We accept the offer, exactly as it stands, only Lasse and I go home and show our faces from time to time. We commute, then. How often? - Twice a week? Whatever's needed. - Forget it. - Why? - It'll never work. Sure it will, the flight takes two hours. It's easy. - It still won't work. - Stop being so negative. Beatrice will do spot checks. She'll assume that we'll try to cheat. - There are rules, you heard her. - Then give us a better option! I can't stay. I'm in the middle of a production. Shall I call the director and say, "I've got a summer job at a hotel?" It's not on. This is so bloody typical of her, too. Even when she's dead she screws with me. I get that. I have a restaurant. I can't stick around either. Lasse, I'm employed! This won't work! - I own a restaurant! - And you have employees! I can't stay at this fucking place either! We have to sort this out! Shut up! Will you please be quiet. There's a reason why this "fucking place" still exists. And that's because I've been running it all these years. Without me, we wouldn't have this "fucking" inheritance. This must be so hard for you. You can go home to your lives. My life, my home, was taken from me. Three years ago, as it turns out. Everything I have is here. And now nothing is mine. - Hi, Konrad. - Hello, Oskar. - Did you find the mobile? - No, it's gone. - It'll turn up. - Some bastard's nicked it. Listen... When you were kids your father and I went to Scotland. We bought a bottle of Scotch each and I think that Mauritz saved his bottle all these years. And I was thinking... Well, it'd mean a lot to me if I could take over his bottle. If it's still around. He was my brother, after all. Is that why you came today? For a bottle of Scotch? No, of course not, but... It would mean a lot to me. There's been a bottle of Scotch in the safe for years. - Could that be the one? - Could be. If I give you this bottle of Scotch Konrad, I want to hear no more talk of us disrespecting Mauritz. Look! This is the one! This means a lot to me, Oskar. Thank you. He's alive, you know. - Who? - Mauritz. - No, Konrad, he isn't. - Are you sure about that? I'll let you know when we find the mobile. Goodbye, Konrad. Goodbye. - Two specials! - You're not overcooking it, I hope? - In shreds. But you need to peel it. - I've got this, Lasse. - I need that steak. - Two minutes. - You're overcooking it. - I'm not. - Where's Mårtensson? - He called in sick. - What? - Grieving. Over who? Two hashes and a vegetarian. You're burning it. No, it's not. What's today's vegetarian? - Ask Mårtensson. - My God, don't overcook it. - I'm not! Stop it! - Plate it up now. - God damn it! - Enough. Get out of the kitchen. - I'm sorry, Oskar. - Get out of the kitchen! - Do it yourself, for fuck's sake! - I will. Go on, Lasse, run away. It's what you're good at. We have guests out there, and you're acting like a bunch of teenagers. - Am I to have them for a full season? - Yes, just you. - We , then. - But it is how it is so deal with it! Can you deal with it? I don't mean work, I mean... Lasse? That was 20 years ago. Can't this wait? - Everyone's waiting for their food. - Yes. Two veggies and a hash. By the way, something's happened. - Lasse... - Not now, Liv. He's being such a... Kim's gone. - Gone? - Call her. Hi, you've reached Kim. I can't come to the phone... - Her phone's been switched off. - She's probably on the ferry. - On the ferry? - I've called the ferry companies. She's not on any passenger list. I'll go out and look for her. Maybe she's waiting for the next one. I have to go. I'll take the lanes. I'll come with you. - Did she say what he looked like? - No. - The old bastard... - We'll find her. I'm such a fucking idiot. - This is just Åland, not Stockholm. - So what? This isn't your fault. Has she done this before? - Lasse? Is this typical of her? - No. Kim? - Hi, Jonna. - Oh! Hello, Mildred. I was going to put a flower on your mother's grave... ...but I see she's not there. There was some sort of a mix-up and we had to bury her elsewhere. Just as well. We won't have to run into each other. - Have you seen Kim? - I never had a chance to talk to you. Kim's gone missing, so I don't really have... You were there that morning when your father and my Gunnar rowed off. - I can't talk about this now. - I want to know what happened. I'm sorry. I have to go. Kim's sitting by the eastern jetty. She looks a little lost. Thank you. Did you see a young girl leave on that ferry? Kim Waldemar... He knows nothing. He hasn't seen her. - What the hell am I going to do? - The best we can do is wait. She has her phone. I'm sure she'll switch it back on. Lasse, it's going to be alright. I promise. Let's go. - Hello? - It's me. I've found her. - Is she OK? See you at home. - OK. Bye. - Where have you been? - Dad and I had a row. I just wanted to leave this place, but I changed my mind at the ferry. He can be such a dick at times. Fuck! Sorry. What were you going to do in Stockholm? I wasn't planning to stay there. So where? Come on, Kim. I need to know. Copenhagen. - Has Mum said you could stay? - We've talked about it. About you going there? - About living with her. - Cut that out, you live with me, OK? You just live close to my school. What does that matter if we're here? I could take a year off and study there. Or you stay with me. I don't think we'll be staying here anyway. We'll soon be back in Stockholm. You in school and... ...me in my restaurant. That's some good news at least, right? - Hello? - Is this Jonna Waldemar? - Speaking. - My name's Rakel Olsson. Oh! Hi! I'd like to ask you something. Is this a bad time? No, go ahead! I'm working on a new film. - I was wondering if you want to meet. - Sure! - Beatrice is here. - Oskar, it's time! - Are you OK? - Yes, sure. - You misunderstood. I was just... - It's fine. OK, good. - I've never noticed it before. - Noticed what? The potential. This is just an old boarding house. Without guests, it's worthless. - What are you talking about? - I mean with the will and... ...the spirit, you can turn this into something really big. Corporate dos, conferences... - Come on, Beatrice is waiting. - I'm not joking. - Are you being serious? - Yes. Turn it into a theme park with candy floss and bearded ladies? - Hello again. - Hi. - We've come to a... - Where's Jonna? - She's on her way. - We'll wait for her. For all these years... ...you never thought to tell me? No. Even when you saw all the work Live and I put into it? No. - Indifferent. - Absolutely not. But I'm a lawyer. Anna-Lisa was my client. My personal opinion concerning the rightful owner is crystal clear. Are the boat enthusiasts aware of how close they are to the pot of gold? No. - Where is she? - I'll go and get her. Jonna! I need all three signatures on the agreement. I gave you plenty of time to think it through. Just give us two more minutes, Beatrice. This is Jonna. I can't talk right now so leave a message at the beep. What was she thinking? Or was she thinking at all? Is she even capable of thinking? If she was here I'd kill her. I'm not sure that would have helped. I'd have killed her myself. So tomorrow the boarding house gets given to the boat people. She gave us 24 hours for old times' sake. What the hell are we going to do now? When I woke up this morning... ...I thought this would be the beginning. Now everything seems to have come to an end. Manne? Manne? Hi! What are you doing here? What a surprise! Listen now. I have an audition... I will be auditioning for a film. For the main role! - Congratulations! - They said I'd be perfect for it. A delivery came for you earlier. God knows what it is. It must be the script. Finally! This is so great! They say it's pretty much a done deal. - Lasse speaking. - Hey! It's Jojjen. Just tell me it's fully booked tonight. So you haven't heard? No? Lasse, I'm really sorry but... ...the whole fucking restaurant is in flames. It's burning like mad. There are ambulances, the police, firemen... The whole place is on fire.
