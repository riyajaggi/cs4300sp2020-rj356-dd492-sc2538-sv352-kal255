 The three of you will run the guest house together. There must be a law against not leaving your children an inheritance. Yes, if you're the owner. What ever happened with the pool? If I stay for a few days, maybe I could fix it. - That's a bad idea. - Why's that? - Are you still mad that I left? - It's just a bad idea. - You don't want a pool? - I don't want you here. - What's that? - The guest house. I had a vision of how to expand and modernise it. To create a complete experience instead of just coffee and biscuits.

 - I want you to think about it. - Why would I give up my career? Because it's my life we're talking about. I'll lose everything. I stayed. I took care of her. I kept the family above water. Do you have any idea what I've done for you, Lasse and for Mum? - Do you have any clue? - Calm down. Stay out of it. This is family business. Why did Oskar never finish the pool? He lost interest. - You left. - Lasse is the same as always. He always has his eye on something. What if your immature behaviour is all about your childhood? - No. No. - He's trying. Give him a chance. There won't be a damn pool!

 That's it. Can everyone understand that? Huh? - What the hell are you saying? - I can't rule out arson. Have you told anyone else? No, I haven't. So, I'm the only one who knows? You don't count. Because I'm a priest? Because I trust you. - Isn't it a burden? - Burden? Guilt and... I didn't have a choice. - You always have a choice. - I had to move him. It doesn't have anything to do with guilt. THICKER THAN WATER Let's go, Petra. I have some things to do. - That are more important than this? - Yes. - Oskar? - Yes. - This is a funeral. - Yeah... - It's your father's funeral. - Yeah... Yes. I didn't put him here in the cove. Be glad you're friends with the only priest in the Baltic Sea that's willing to take part in this madness. I don't understand how this affects Mauritz's last journey. No... But given all the illegal acts, a worthy funeral for your father might help our last journey. Yes... Heavenly Father, we're gathered here today on Jungfru Cove, to bid farewell to Mauritz Waldemar. Who do you think you are? You fucking idiot! How hard can it be? That's enough! Is it cold? It's nice. Excuse me, I didn't expect company. Can you hand me my robe? Of course. - There you go. - Thanks. - Bored? - Yes, very. Can I borrow the pier and my wife now that you're done swimming? Absolutely. - Remember the pole raising. - I'll see you there. It's not just anyone that's coming. I'll let you handle them, Oskar. Honey, will you help me drink this up? - Wow! You've really made an effort. - Yes. This midsummer will be perfect. A big wedding means lots of guests. Lots of guests means lots of money. Lots of money means extra staff, which gives us more time together. Wow! - Hello? - Hello. Damn it! Manne, I don't have time to talk now. - Are you working on midsummer? - It's a guest house. We have guests. - Yeah, your guest house. - Not yet. - We'll talk later. - Jonna, I want to see you. - I have to go now. - How is it now? - I want you to come next weekend. - That won't work. I thought you liked cutting class. Will principal Oskar not let you? - Bye. Kisses. - Wait! Jonna? Jonna? What? You always said the last thing you wanted was to waste your life running a guest house like your mum. Hello? - Would you like some coffee? - No thanks. Who's that? Huh? No one. Was it about the restaurant? Have they said anything? No. Why can't they tell you anything? Sometimes you don't want to talk about it. Okay? You know the feeling? It's Tommy Fasth from the Stockholm police. I'm trying to get a hold of Lars-Erik Waldemar, but it's not so easy. I have some questions. Can you ring me? My number is 0755 53 25 61. 0755 53 25 61. Thanks. -Anything good int he bag? You're early. The wedding guests aren't here yet. - Is it a secret? - Old champagne. - Did you celebrate? - Yes. Where is Jonna? Jonna? Mårtensson? What the hell? We have 30 wedding guests coming and we need to raise the pole. - Yes? - I saw the delivery van. The cold goods need to be put away. 800 strawberries that can spoil. - Come on, put your apron on! - Okay, take it easy. These aren't just any guests. It's important. Where's Mårtensson? - And the extra staff? - Sure, but I still need you. - Take this with you. - You're so stressed. - Shouldn't you take the day off? - He doesn't know how to. I can take a day off. I'm calm. Totally calm. Ta-da! Honey! My god! Oops. Come, my dear. Ah! Here's Dad! Are they here already? Damn it! - Can I help you? - It's fine. - Where did you put the strawberries? - What? - Oh! - Yeah... What... - What did you say he works with? - Björn Lehman. CEO of Nordic Bank. He sits on more boards then you can imagine. He's the type that dines with royalty. - Is everything set? - Relax. Everything's under control and ready to go, so we're set. - Okay. What about the pole? - Oscar! Take it easy. Hey, we're making 16,000 euros on this. We don't get so many weddings anymore, so we should be grateful. - Strawberries are in the big fridge. - Thanks. - Hello! Oscar Waldemar, welcome. - Björn Lehman. - So this is the Waldemar guest house? - Yes. - Dad... - I can ask questions. I hope you enjoy your stay. All of the orders have been made. The rooms are a bit small, but very cosy. Mårtensson is a top chef. He's even won awards in Finland. This will be great. - Isn't she beautiful? - Excuse me? - My daughter, isn't she beautiful? - Very. And now she'll be a bride. Time just flies by. Yes, it does. I booked every room at the Grand Hotel but Nilla wanted this place. - Here we go again. - Not in Mariehamn, but here. Can you understand that? - Yes... No... - No. So I expect you to deliver everything as promised. - Of course. - Do we understand each other? - Orvar? - Come on, Dad. My name is Oskar. Did you see the beautiful bride and groom? Yes. They should just throw in the towel and spare the financial ruin. I don't just mean the rings. Lawyers cost... Ouch! - A fortune, I can say. - Throw in the towel. That sounds like a classic Lars Waldemar strategy. - I speak from experience. - Not everyone gets a divorce. - They weren't married to my ex. - I haven't got a divorce. But I guess it's easier to write a letter and say "bye", quick and easy. - Cecilia! - Kim! I've finished with this tray. Can you take it to the bridal pair? Whoa! - Careful. It's heavy. - Yes, I have it. Put the Champagne on ice first. Lasse, drink up. We have to raise the pole. Fuck, we should have more people. It weighs three tons. Two tons. - You should be the strong one. - And you should be the smart one. How did you do it last time? We have cold beers if you'd like. Don't just stand there. Come and help! Do you really think I'd help you raise that phallic symbol? - No thanks. - Good for you, Kim. Don't give me that look. She gets that from her mum. Up, up, up! Let's switch sides. Switch sides. I remember when Jansson's midsummer pole crashed down on Dad's car. There were two people raising that pole. Good that you parked far away. Please! Help instead! Just... Put it down. Let go, let go, let go! Let it go. But honey... Come and give us a hand? - How's your back? - It's fine. - What did you mean? About the letter? - Forget it. - You meant something. - It doesn't matter now. You've made it so nice. - This'll be good. - Yes. Here. He's afraid of you. Did you pack? Is that for Liv? - I have to try to explain. - She'll understand. Give this to Liv. Where are you going? - Just give the letter to Liv. - Where will you go? - A lot of gifts. - Yes. Sign here. Yes. - There. Thanks so much. - Thanks. Cecilia? Can you tell the bride and groom that they have received gifts? I'll leave them here. Thanks. Shit. - What's that? - This? No, nothing. - Did you leave the tray? - Oh... Yes. Lasse? Did you cover the pool? Considering our distinguished guests, it'd be great if the didn't fall and break their necks. - Aren't you going to answer? - No, not on Midsummer. Let's keep the death toll to a minimum, thanks. Nagging old man. It's Midsummer, damn it! If anyone calls, I'm not here. The usual strategy, that is. - Always that tone. What's wrong? - Nothing. - You always have some remark. - Is that a problem? Is it about the letter? Yes, I wrote a letter. It was 20 years ago. I handwritten from the heart, but I never heard back. But like you said, it doesn't matter now, so stop with the remarks. What did you say? From your heart? Should that make me feel better? What is with you? You wrote a cold and cynical letter that ended everything. Oskar was right. You haven't changed at all. The first sign of conflict, and you run and forget everything. There it is... Do you feel better? Yes, you, Orvar. The guests will arrive on a chartered boat at three. Yes. - Yes, yes. That works. - All according to your instructions. I'd like to taste the wine. It has to breathe, but you're aware of that? Yes, of course. This way. The wine is over here. Give me the bottle, he would like to try it. - What? - He wants to taste it. Give me a bottle. - What have you done? - Nothing. There, now we'll see. There. Mårtensson, can you tell everyone... Thank you. Just two minutes. Chateau Margaux, exquisite. Balance, style, class. - This isn't the wine I ordered. - Yes it is. Chateau Margaux -97. No, Chateau Margaux -94. That is even better. - Better? - How? - Are you a wine connoisseur? - No. No, but... But obviously you are. Maybe you wanted to make a little money. Good. Okay. Then we know where we stand. Fucking Ålanders. - This isn't good. - No! What do we do? - No one has noticed yet. - It shouldn't take too long. It's just like me! - You have to take care of it. - Mum and Dad are going to freak out. - Not to mention the bride and groom. - You have to get it to the room. - I'm not going back there. - Just tell them the truth. - It was an accident. - The damage is done. - What would you do, Einstein? - Me? Leave me out of it. You have to help me. It wasn't so bad. It's fine. It'll be great. It'll be super good, Dad. - Martin? - Yes. - You'll stay here. - Why? Isn't he allowed to see it? We need to stick to tradition. The groom shouldn't see the bride nor the dress before the wedding. Okay, Björn. You are so traditional. Yes, it's a good thing someone is considering where we are. It's been altered and I'd like to see it. Yes, I'm sure grandmother Margret wouldn't have a problem with that. An English cut and a Swedish beauty. Thanks, Dad. What the hell? What the hell! - Orvar! - Damn it! - Liv! You must come, honey. - Don't you see I'm busy? - There might not be a wedding. - No, they said it'll clear up. It's not that. We have a small... situation, you could call it. The dress has disappeared! And it's not just any dress! It's inherited! Unique! Made in England, for my grandmother's wedding. Do you know how expensive it is? - You've looked everywhere? - Yes, everywhere. I don't understand. We're the only ones with keys to the room. - Are you accusing me? - No... We'll look again, to make sure. All of us. Yes. There it is. - How's it going? - Yeah, good. There's just been a little... misunderstanding here. Fuck! Maybe it wasn't the best idea after all. What happened to the dress? Can you explain it? Go and make sure everything is fine. The guests need food and drinks. - But the dress... - The wedding and Midsummer go ahead. We'll fix this. You're not just a cheater, you also make a mess of things. I don't know how this happened, but of course we'll fix this. Yes, I presume so! And we're not paying one crown! We'll take care of it. We'll compensate you. - Compensate? It's irreplaceable! - We'll do what we can. Damn idiots. - Hi. - Hi. Okay... Irreplaceable, damn fool. Nothing's irreplaceable. What were you thinking? Are you mad? Should they not pay? - Listen here, Oskar... - 16,000 euros! My money. Your money? It's damn well our money. As long as you're in debt to me, it's actually my money. Do you understand who he is? He can buy half the island and build an amusement park here. You should have thought about that before you changed the order. What a loss. He's going to pay everything. Just like everyone else. Then we need to do the wedding and the party. They can't leave. Where do you find a new wedding dress on Midsummer's Eve? Well... Yes, what is it? We've both put a lot of money into this, salaries, food and drink, so... - We suggest to do the wedding anyway. - No. We're cancelling it. We're leaving as soon as we're packed. - Dad... - Yes, we're leaving this farce. Give us another hour. Say yes, Dad. - One hour, two whiskeys. Nilla? - Champagne. Can I have a calvados? Nice drawings. I didn't know you cared about my ideas. It's an occupational habit. When I see a good thing I can't leave it be. - I was just sketching for fun. - It's a really good idea you have. You think? Thanks. Hey... I have to get back to work. Can't we have lunch and talk about it more? Maybe. We'll see. Talk later. - What did he say? - He won't pay. - But the food and extra staff? - He claims breach of contract. They're leaving any minute now. - What do we do? - They can't leave. 16,000 euros. - What would Anna-Lisa have done? - How's that? What would Anna-Lisa have done about what? - Doesn't she have another dress? - You mean, a back-up? Constructive, Jonna, constructive. Apparently it's irreplaceable. Get the bride, groom and the father down to the restaurant. And treat them to our best whiskey. - We've done that. What are you going to do? I have an idea. I don't want to hear any more excuses. Just get it done! Nothing's impossible. There's always... Do you know what? I don't want to hear more excuses. I asked to hire the biggest, safest and best you had to offer. Not a fucking damaged wreck. I won't take no for an answer. Dad? Where is everyone? Isn't it time? The boat with all the guests broke down... I don't know when they'll be here. But it'll be okay, my dear. I'll... - I'll handle it. - How are you going to handle it? Fly them here? - Yes. - Listen... This is actually the best gift you could have given to me and Martin. I don't need to share this day with anyone else. Especially not your business friends. I love you, Dad, and everything you do for me. But this is our place, and only ours. - And turn off that damn telephone. - Yes, yes... All that remains to be said is that the herring is served. And that, yes... The wedding reception may begin. - Hi! - You never showed? The mountain must come to Mohammed. - What the hell are you doing here? - Are you surprised? Yes. Yes... One of my... duties as father of the bride is to give a speech to honour the couple. I understand that this place means a lot to my daughter. This is where you realised how much you meant to each other. It was here that you... fell in love with each other. Cheers to the bride and groom. Cheers to the bride and groom. Love may they live! Hip hip hooray! Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray! Hi! - Hi. Is it okay that we dock here? - Yes, no problem. - It's windy. - Yes. - Do you live around here? - No. - So you're on the run? - Yes, of course. - Your boat? - Yes. What about life jackets? They're right here. Look, I have a 12 year old whiskey with a name I can't pronounce. Would you like some? It's on the house. What are you doing? Nothing. - We're just talking. - Keep talking then. - We thought about heading over there. - Over there. They have a seaside restaurant that seems good. - Not celebrating with the family? - I don't consider them family. What about you? It's just me and Mum. The countess and the servant. - No friends? - You've seen how people avoid me. I don't. - Have a beer and relax. - Thanks. The banker's going to pay. Everything worked out. It went well. - Cheers. - Cheers. It ended up alright. I can't believe that this is our first Midsummer together in... a long fucking time. - Why the hell is he even here? - Who? Manne. He just pops up out of nowhere. What does he want? What does he want? He wants to get laid. I don't want him... to influence her. She's supposed to be here all summer. - Hey, Jonna takes care of herself. - Yeah... I'm so happy to have her. Liv. I love her, but I'm bad at showing it. She loves you too. It's obvious. - Will you fix the tarp? - Sure. Don't answer it! Oskar! What? It's for you. - Yes, this is Lars Waldemar. - Tommy Fasth, Stockholm police. - I've been trying to reach you. - Yeah, I've been busy here. - Are you working on Midsummer? - Yes, I am a police officer. I'll get to the point. When you don't call me back I start to get a little suspicious. The thing is, my mum passed away recently. So I had to come to Åland. - So you're abroad? - Yes, if Åland counts. You said you're on Åland, that's abroad. There's an investigation ongoing, and you're not taking my calls. What should I think about that? What's this about? Tell me where you were on the 27th of May, when the restaurant burned down. Here on Åland, at my mother's guest house. At the guest house, alright. All evening and all night? Yes, there are witnesses that can confirm it. - Am I a suspect? - I'll come back to that. Don't go anywhere. And answer when I call. Happy Midsummer. Are you still here? Yes, they're married, so I'm off duty. - Nice. - Where are you going? To talk with Liv. - John Lennon was right. - That Beatles were bigger than Jesus? They sold more albums, but love is greater. That's right. - Do you want to dance? - I'll see you later, Petra. Do you want to dance? - Honey? - Hi. - Hi. I've been looking for you. - I've been here. I thought we'd celebrate a little, like we talked about. Like you talked about. It doesn't always work out as planned, especially this Midsummer... - It worked out in the end. - We haven't got the money yet. No, but it... Damn it! I told him to take care of the tarp! Someone could fall in. I told him to take care of it! All this anger... That's how you usually react. It wasn't Lasse's letter I received, was it? It was so long ago, but I've always wondered. Lasse said it was handwritten. It was you who wrote it, didn't you? I was 16 years old, Liv. Aren't you happy with the life we've had together? You seem different here. Stop the analysing. I have a psychologist. Jonna... You don't see it yourself. Mum used to tell me all kinds of things when I was a kid. I just thought it was hocus-pocus. - Stuff that Ålanders do. - Ålanders... Yeah. Things I wouldn't do myself, but... But when I came out here, I... remembered everything she taught me. I like it's in my bones, in my DNA maybe. I had a crazy idea. I love crazy ideas. I want us to get married. In Stockholm, this fall. We travelled a lot when I was small. But with all the work Mum and Dad had no time for each other. Now we never travel. I miss it. What about you? Have you travelled? No... Mum was over 40 when she had me. She was told she couldn't have children. Then she had me. Don't you have a dad? Dad and Mauritz went out to sea, but only Mauritz came back. It's a mystery. No one talks about it. That's why my mum hates the Waldemar family. Feuds are inherited whether you like it or not. - Yes? - Hi! Hi, it's me. Look, I can use a little help at home. I don't feel like talking right now. I'm looking for Cecilia. I'm having trouble with the faucet, maybe you could help me? The faucet? What should I do with it? No... I... I'm trying to keep it from flooding. - I need you to bring me a wrench. - Flooding? - Yeah, and the slip joint pliers. - Yes, I'm coming. Cecilia! Darling? Here. There you are. I've been looking for you. Listen. Hey, shouldn't we go to bed? It was... me who ruined the dress. I... thought it was so beautiful... - And I spilled wine, and just... - I know, sweetheart. - You're not angry? - No. I'm not angry. - Should I tell Dad? - Dad doesn't need to know. - He doesn't? - No. Dad doesn't need to know everything. Come on. Oh no! I forgot the tools. I won't be long. - Hi, honey. - Hi. - Where's your mum? - She's getting tools. - Yeah, it's... - Yes. Nice. - Do you want to sit down? - No, that's okay. Good night, then. Liv? Liv? Regarding the payment, I... Have a cigar, Oskar. Okay... There was a wedding after all, despite everything. Yes, despite the mishaps. Well done. Here's the money. Minus the cost you tried to swindle me out of with the wine. It's only fair. Hand rolled in Cuba. It's your tip. - Thanks. - I import them. Fucking Stockholmer. I left Åland because of Dad. I wanted you to come when you finished school. You have to believe me. I love you. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
