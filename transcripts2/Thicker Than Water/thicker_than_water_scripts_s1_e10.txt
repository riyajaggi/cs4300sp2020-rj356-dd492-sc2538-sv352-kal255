 The whole restaurant's on fire. It's totally ablaze. The ambulances are here. Are you certain about this? I have the money. What happens now? - How is Timo doing? - He's going to be sent to prison for a crime you asked him to carry out. I think this is a decent salary for him to keep quiet. Hi. Oskar, I can't go back. We're thinking of staying. I'll write off your debt, if you leave here as soon as possible. Stay the fuck away from my wife! Understand? Stay the fuck away!

 The technical evidence confirms that the fire at restaurant Apetit Wednesday the 27th May was started deliberately. We have evidence connecting the defendant, Timo Lehto, to the scene immediately prior to the fire starting. We don't however, have a motive. And because of this, we do not believe that Lehto was acting alone. I was drunk that night. They refused to let me in that night, so I returned later that night and started the fire. Alone? Not under the behest of someone else? I acted alone. THICKER THAN WATER There we go. Thanks a lot. - Thanks a lot. - Thank you too.

 - Hi. - When did you get here? - Just now. - I have to go. Hey... the thing with the fire at the restaurant. - It's over. I'm no longer a suspect. - Great. - And I've bought the cottage. - The mouldy cottage? Or the cottage. Our cottage. We can move in whenever we want. Okay... I need to go now. But I'll see you later. - See you later then. - Yeah. The last of the daily takings. The last night, right? I knew we'd get through it. With the will, I mean. - Yeah. - And we're not happy because... Huh? Yeah, of course we're glad. What's this? Today's takings. To take to the bank. Why didn't you say anything? Put the money in box 341 at the post office. Today. Tomorrow's too late. I have the checklist from last years closing we don't want to forget to drain the oil again. Remember? Or forget to deposit the takings. We left them in the safe last year. Throw out the old menus. What's up? Is this really what you want to do? To drain the oil? I'll take the takings in later. I mean if you could do anything you wanted. What would you do? What kind of a question is that? If I could do anything I wanted? Yeah, if you could chose anything. - Is it a difficult question? - Yes, of course it is. It's not exactly how life works. No. If you had to answer. I don't know. Seriously? You don't know what you'd do? But you know what you'd do? Yeah. I'd close the guesthouse for the season. Then I'd buy out my siblings. Then I'd take my wife and daughter on a really long holiday. Then I'd like to plan next season with my wife and daughter. But most of all, I'd like to leave this difficult period behind us. Together. - Hi. - Hi. I have a room booked. Yeah, of course. You're our last guest for the season. Not that you get a prize or anything, but it is a little cool. Yes. I'll just get you your key. There you go. It's room 17. - Welcome. It's the next floor up. - Thanks. Here. Look. "We see the family and there darkest secrets. No one's safe. I found a common language deep within myself and managed to convey it through these amazing actors." She's playing your role right? But you didn't even want the role. So what did Timo Lehto get then? Three years. Do you think he'll get through it? He's been paid well. Three years. It's still a long time. So, back to Stockholm it is then. Kim will be relieved. No. We're going to be neighbours. What did you say? - The Mouldy cottage? - Yeah. The seller was okay with getting the money when the will is settled. This contract... you can wipe your arse on it. I told you I couldn't go back. What is it with you? And I said to you, if you slip up once more, I'd call the police and tell them about you and Timo. Oskar, you're not going to call the police. No, and for what crazy reason would I not do that? You have no idea? Lasse. You're going to leave this place. Hi. I'd like to file a report. Okay. You can start by filling in this here. Thanks. She just sits there, staring at the urn. As though she's gone nuts. I think it's called sorrow. I think you need the monkey wrench for that. It wasn't like it was yesterday that dad disappeared. It wasn't even this century. Is that why you're still here? Cause you think she's crazy? I've go nowhere else to go. - What about Copenhagen? - What is there in Copenhagen? Me, soon. - What's Lasse got to say about that? - I don't care. Are you just going to leave? Can you not stay? Can you not come with me? - Lars Waldemar. Where can I find him? - I can take a message. It's private. - Sorry, have we met before? - Where is he? - Try the little cottage opposite. - Thanks. - What are you doing here? - You ran away from me. - You can't just turn up here. - You're supposed to pay from day one. When I get my part of the guesthouse. That's the deal. He can trust me. I don't have the money. I need the inheritance. You have until tomorrow. Hello? Hi. What, now? Okay, I'm on my way. - Lasse? - Yeah. How was it in Stockholm? - Good, I'm free. - Free? Yeah, the court let me go, so. Yeah, it's over. - Did she get hold of you? - Who? The woman from Helsinki. What's she doing here? How the hell should I know? I have no idea. - No idea? - No, I need to... Lasse, it's not over is it? I need to go, Liv. We can talk about it later. Hi. I was surprised you rang. Jump in. Gunnar's going back to the sea. It's fitting for you to come with me. You need this just as much as I do. - Are you sorting out the banking? - Yeah... or, I'll do it later. - What the hell are you doing? - I'm reading. - What the hell? - Where's the money? Is that why she's here? Is the money for her? I saw that her name's Lehto. Is it to keep Timo quiet? - Liv you don't understand. - Yes I do. I get that you lie, and steal. And that there are people who think you're innocent and believe in you. What did you said to Kim? And me? - It's not what you... - No? What did you think? I wouldn't get what you were up to in the office? - It never ends. - What you're doing, makes it worse. Like everything you do. I'm sorry. So here we are, you and I. You who saw everything, but never spoke. And I who stayed here, because I didn't know. You could have left whenever you wanted. - Like you, you mean? - Yes. But you still came back. And now you're stuck here. You are where you are. And now you're stuck. You and I Jonna, we're stuck. Pour Gunnar out now, so that it's done. Now you're free Gunnar. You're finally free. No! No! - Can't we just leave? - What would that solve? We can go wherever. Borås. Albuquerque. You decide. Could you even find Albuquerque on a map? - I'm being serious. - Lasse. Liv, I love you. I had to get rid of her. What the hell was I supposed to do. I was in trouble. It was wrong. Okay? I'm sorry. - Oskar's trying to frame me. - Why would he do that? He wants me out of the guesthouse. When the will's resolved, he's going to go to the police. Liv, please, you have to help me. Please. If you want to smoke you can do, on the terrace, not indoors. Why does it matter? I'm the final guest. I'm sorry, but we have our rules. What are you waiting for? I never want to see you here again. Do you understand? - Have you seen Mildred? - What? - Have you seen my mum? - No, I've not seen her. Let me know if you see her later. Mum! Hi. - What is it? - It's from my mum, I don't know why. Nice. I'm checking out. - Already? - Yeah. Has something happened? Give this to Lasse. - What was that about? - Nothing. - You threw a fag end in the car. - Yes I did! You can never escape! That was Timo's wife. And you didn't know? - Yes. - What was she doing here? - What did you say to her? - Nothing. Nothing. So she left because you fought over a cigarette? I didn't want her here! - Don't do this Liv. - Don't do what? - Don't take Lasse's side. - But that's exactly what I... Yes! You've taken Lasse's side from the minute he got here. Where is your loyalty? It should be to me. To us, our family. Not to him! What is your fucking obsession with Lasse? Liv, please... please, I'm trying. Can you please try as well. So that we can get back to normal... Normal? Look at you. What have you become? A paranoid, overly critical, small little man who wants to send his own brother to prison. Oskar, what the hell! You drag your criminal past here, you're destroying my marriage. You're fucking crazy! Do you think she would've wanted you if you hadn't done what you did? You can't get your own, so you hook up with my ex. You fucking loser! She's too good for you! You're a fucking coward! You couldn't even protect mum! You're so fucking weak! I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you! Oskar! Oskar! Oskar! Oskar, stop! Stop! I killed dad. So I can kill you as well! Oskar. Oskar. I didn't know what to do. You should have said something to us. We could have helped you. So dad's been dead all of these years? He's really gone? - What happens now? - Nothing. The old bastard's dead. It's just a relief to know that. You didn't know? - Be honest. - How the hell could I have known? Look me in the eye and tell me you didn't know anything. Oskar, I didn't know anything. There's someone... someone who knows. Fredrik? Post box 341, thanks. Thanks. Hello? Hello? Fredrik? - He might not even come today. - He wrote that tomorrow's too late. - Is it someone you know? - It could be. When I left the island, when I was 19... Do you really think I wanted to leave you guys? But I still did. Because Dad scared the life out of me. I left you guys, you and Jonna... alone. - And you thought that I let you down. - Which you did. What did Mum say to you? When she talked to us one to one. That I need to forgive. Forgive who? Her. Or me? Can you forgive me for letting you down? I wasn't as strong as you. I couldn't stay. What did Mum say to you? That I should look after you guys. - He's not coming. - What do you want to do? Let's go. - What the... - What the hell is it now? - Jonna, what are you doing? - I'm moving in. - What do you mean, you're moving in? - Is this something to keep? - No, let's get rid of it then. - Stop it! But Oskar, it's all old junk. It's nothing to save. - You're not living here. - Why not? - Because. - That's not enough. Because you're not Anna-Lisa. - What did you say? - This is Mum's room. No, what did you say before that? He said that you're not Anna-Lisa. That's exactly what she said to me, when we had our talk. She said exactly that. And I just yelled at her. - But the fact is, you're right Oskar. - Thanks, finally. I am not her. And that's exactly why I can move in here. - No... - You don't need to throw out the... Yep. That goes for you guys as well. Out! Good bye. Hi. What's happened to you? Oskar. You had a fight with your little brother? Yeah, you got it in one. What are you doing? - Mum said that I could come. - Okay, again? For good. - When are you leaving? - Now. - Are you sure about this? - Yes. We... We've had good times as well... now. Kim. - I tried. - I know. I love you. I love you too. Good bye. I'll see you soon. Ring me when you get there. - Hi. - Hi. - What did he say? - What could he say, other than "bye". - What did Mildred say? - Nothing. She's disappeared. - Do you still want to leave? - I wrote her a note. That's more than she did. Forget about it. Here's your ticket. As long as our flight in Copenhagen takes off before they realise. We'll be drinking our first beer in Saigon before they even realise. - How much do you have on your card? - Enough. - I'm picking up some pocket money. - What do you mean, pocket money? No, it's nothing. Can you stop at the post office in Mariehamn? - There you go. - Thanks a lot. Thank you for the season Mårtensson. We can wash up, so you can go home. - See you next year. - Thanks for all the help. - Thanks. - Good bye! - Do you want anymore? - No thanks. Could you pass me the lingonberry jam? Stay calm. I'm not going to hold a sentimental speech about how its been worth all the hassle. It probably hasn't. But, I know that it's over, and that we survived. - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Hi. - Hi. What's he doing here? - I invited him. - Oskar... Who would have thought it... Yeah. So, tomorrow's the day. Yeah. It's been a strange summer. Indeed. "Manne Wahlström, reported for assault and destruction of property." How should I take this? Well he's broken the law. So that's for the police to decide. Yeah... I'm thinking of keeping it exactly as it is now. - No spa area? - No. There's nothing wrong with coffee and cake. It's always worked well here. And if the pool's not ready, people can still swim in the sea. I thought you had big plans? We'll see. New Mexico. I Googled. Albuquerque's in New Mexico. And it's really cold in the Kola Peninsula. So I'd guess, you'd probably prefer Borås? Lasse, you know that this will never happen. I know. About that trip... - It was just an idea. It was stupid. - Or not. But for me. Alone? - Not with Lasse? - No. Do you love him? I can't separate what's real and what are just old memories any more. But I know that I have loved him. Do you know what's the toughest with all of this here? I will always forgive you... for everything. You have every right to be angry with me. I'm not angry. I'm totally furious. You can't tell. I didn't realise we'd end up together when I wrote the letter. I wrote the letter as revenge, because Lasse had left us here. I told Mum about it. She said I'd regret it. She was right. What are you saying? We've had a lovely summer together haven't we? You're the only woman, I shouldn't have got together with. And now you're the only woman I want to spend my life with. I don't want you to leave. I'll ring when I get there. I'll be fine. Ahh, thanks. Thanks honey. By the way. - I got in. - Got in? To the theatre school in Stockholm. Did you hear that? She got in. That's so cool! Congratulations, darling. Congratulations. - Take the rest of the day off. - Thanks. Wow! Another one in the family Oskar. It must be a virus. - Good morning. - Morning. Good morning. I never thought I'd have the pleasure of doing this. The transference of ownership contract. From today, you each own a third of this guesthouse. And I, own nothing. How does that feel? Anna-Lisa would have been proud. Exactly as you're sitting now, next to each other that's what she always wished for. - Thanks Beatrice. - Thanks. What do we do now?
