 - Is the lady next door like before? - She barely speaks to us. So she still blames us for her husbands death? How about I give you a bonus if you don't dive here? So you're saying that there's something down there? - What's that? - It's the guest house, I... I had an idea that we could maybe... expand. - Do you recognise him? - No, who's that? Timo Lehto. What's your connection to him? None. I've never seen him before. It wasn't Lasse's letter you gave me. You wrote it, right? Mildred...

 If this deal with Rosén goes through we're obviously going to lose a lot of money. That's not something we're trying to hide. But I believe the biggest looser in this deal, would be you. This house... your grandfather grew up here, right? And you were also born in this house, isn't that right? And I'm guessing, that one day your son Fredrik will take it over. This place has always been your home. You can't put a price on that. Goddamn it, we can't have this. Can't we just sort this out once and for all? This is all about Gunnar. You think that Mauritz killed him. And maybe you're right.

 Who know what happened the day they rowed out. But none of us sitting here today are to blame. What do you say Mildred? If we offer to apologise for everything that's happened, are you willing to accept it? Okay then, well at least we tried. Oskar. Go to hell! THICKER THAN WATER Hi, this is Kim's phone. I can't answer right now. Kisses! Hi honey, it's dad. You know why I'm calling. Call me when you can. Bye. Drinking Mildred's moonshine obviously didn't help. So what now? - What can we do, she's selling. - Cause you showed Rosén the sketches. I didn't show them to him. He found my sketches and took them. So, tell us about your genius idea. I had a few thoughts about... to build a spa and relaxation centre. A spa and wellness centre? Are you being serious Jonna? - Is that what all this is about? - It's not about coffee and biscuits. Whatever. We'll lose guests as long as we're next to a building site and when it's finished it wont be as attractive. Either way, we lose out. - Coffee & pie's worked for 100 years. - Yeah, but it's boring. - Can't you talk to Rosén? - And tell him what? Make something up. Plead with him not to buy. Beg if you have to. Or sleep with him. If you haven't already. Just tell him how it is. - It's about Manne? We're on his side. - Which side is that? That we agree with Rosén, about pressing charges. Or we can do it, if he wants? Either way is fine. - Pressing charges against Manne? - He nearly beat him to death. If we have to press charges to save the guesthouse, we should do it. Okay, let's go through what we have... First beg, then sleep with, if that doesn't work, sacrifice Manne. Great. Finally. Hi honey. How are you? - Is this Lars Waldemar? - Yes. I'm ringing about Timo. Your friend who's in jail. - Would you like a cup of coffee? - Please. Can I have a biscuit? - Who is this? - Timo told me to say, he's lonely. What? Tell me who you are, or I'll hang up. He wants an incentive to keep quiet. - Mail. - You can put it there. - What are you writing? - Could you get me a cup of coffee? Now! It's to help with my concentration. "You seem angry." - "I'm not angry." - "Why do you sound angry?" "If all you want is a cup of coffee?" "If all you want is a cup of coffee." "If all you want is a cup of coffee." So Riitta Viljanen's not available today? She's unavailable all day today? I tried to reach her yesterday also. Tell her Oskar Waldemar called. She knows what it's about. How difficult can it be to identify a body. Why are you stressing about that? - Why are the police avoiding me? - Maybe cause you call them every day. But I want to know, okay? Can't you just let it go, just until the police call. At the moment, Mildred's the bigger problem. - Hi. - Hi. - Is it okay to sit down? - Of course. This place would crumble if it wasn't for you. No, I don't know about that. I've been thinking about your grandma. She was quite strict, right? - A little. - How was she with the male guests? Did she fuck them? Did she shag them? Sleep with them? - Are you writing about her? - No, no, hell no. No, this is... This is something else. You're 26 or 27, still at school in the second grade. You should be a man. Mildred said you and your brothers had a drink at her place. - It didn't go too well did it? - Those were my ideas and you know it. - It was my business idea. - I don't get how you sleep at night. I sleep just fine. Other than the pain from your boyfriend's assault. Okay, so that's what this is about? No, this is about a business idea I came to you with. You turned it down, I went to the next interested party. Is there anything that I can do to change your mind? No. What if I report Manne to the police? What he did was wrong. If I press charges... Jonna, for your own sake, let it go. You can't win. - It's so cold. - What? My hands are quite numb. It's so cold, my hands are quite numb. Hi! I didn't know that you were here. I'm so glad! - Have you been here before? - Yes, I've seen it three, four times. You've seen it four times? Why? - It's not that good. - It's the only thing that's playing. You sound just like me when I was your age. I went to everything. I knew then I wanted to act. - No matter what? - What do you mean? - What has Anna-Lisa been saying? - Ahh, I don't care. She has to deal with it no matter what. I need to go away and sort something. No more than one night. - Are you going to see Kim? - No, this is something else. Could you help me with these crates out here. Hotel Kio CONFORMATION NUMBER - Here you go. - Thanks. Bye. - Cecilia's always in Mariehamn. - Do you think she's met someone? No idea. It'd be about time. - You're not worried? - No. Why? - She's young. Anything could happen. - She's young. Anything should happen. Within limits of course. - What's that? - A class reunion. I've not answered. - Why not? - I don't know if I want to go. Of course you should. You should go and have some fun. Cecilia and I can take care of everything here. Go. It's been decided. Hi. That was a bad audience tonight. My timing was totally off. - I'm sure they still loved you. - Do you think so? What are you writing that's so sensitive? It's not sensitive, it's just not finished. Why so secretive then? I've read your rough drafts before. - You always wanted me to read them. - You can read it later. - What is it that's so secret? - There is no secret. - You used to want me to read. - You can read it later. Okay. Oskar's gonna have problems keeping the guesthouse in the family. Cecilia won't stay a day longer than she has to. - Cecilia does whatever her dad says. - That's what he thinks. But daddy's little princess sneaks out at night to see our plays. - Why's that? - She wants to be an actor. Or it's that Rosén guy she's looking at. - What do you mean by that? - You know exactly what I mean. Do you think I'm sleeping with him? Right? Put down that damn play! Is that what you think? - Because I'm not. - No, okay then. You know it's because of me that you're not in jail right? That's a really interesting detail. - That you beat people up? - No, that I'm not in Jail. - What? - Why hasn't Rosén gone to the police? - Ask him. I don't fucking know. - I would, but I'm not allowed to. - I don't want you to beat him up. - That's the official version. - Who is it that's keeping secrets? - Have you totally lost your mind? You're a fucking idiot! Go fuck yourself! What do you want? I've something that's worth more than Rosén money. - What are you talking about? - Gunnar. I know what happened to Gunnar. I know how he died. Give me your word that you won't sell and I'll tell you everything. - How do you know what happened? - Because I was there. Hi. This is Oskar Waldemar. Yeah exactly. The one out on Åland. Yeah, I just wanted to see how it was going. So you still don't have a positive identification? No. But he drowned, didn't he? But he was found at the bottom of the sea. I think I'll go to that reunion after all. - Is that okay? - What? - What do you think. Is it okay to go? - Yeah. - What is it? - Nothing. - Hi. - Hi. I'm just checking that you're all here. - Where's Lasse? - He's... driving guests to the ferry. - I'm just gonna check the bookings. - Of course. There's only 15 days left now Oskar. Everything's going okay, right? Imagine you pushed someone down the stairs. Like a hypothetical game. - A game where you push someone? - Not me, someone else. Let's say you. Okay. Who did I push? Your dad. I pushed my dad down the stairs? Why would I do that? Because he hits your mum. - He hits my mum? - It's a game. Use your imagination. - You mean it's self defence? - Absolutely. You're protecting your mum. But when he falls down the stairs, he hits his head and dies. That complicates the situation. - What do I say to the police? - You say nothing to the police. You bury your father in a hole. - Oskar, of course I call the police. - No. You're young... you're young and you panic you don't want to attract attention, and neither does your mum. - So your mum's in on it? - Yes. Well... We're just playing, just remember that. Years later you have to dig up your father. - Someone's about to find the body. - My God... So instead, you bury your dad at sea. - I think I should stop listening. - We're finished soon. At the spot where you bury him, there happens to be a ship wreck when the scuba divers come they find your dad. The question is, what do you do? That's the part that's the game. - So now the police are involved? - Yes. - Have they identified the body? - Soon. They'll be calling soon, you don't have long. And one important thing... The police now suspect that your dad didn't drown. There are extenuating circumstances. I'm young. I'm protecting my mum. But on the other hand, the burial indicates guilt. Maybe I wanted my dad dead. I would do two things. First, I'd call a lawyer. - A lawyer like you? - A defence lawyer. Second, I'd talk to my family. - Especially if we worked together. - Why? Because it would mean that I'm going to be away for a while. And they're going to have to take care of everything. Make sure that the house is still standing tomorrow. - Course. Have fun. - Yes. Bye. Hello, I have a reservation in Lars Waldemar. Welcome Mr Waldemar. Your room is 104. Has anyone asked for me? - No sorry, not that I know of. - Okay, thanks. Studies at Theatre School Delete web history - What are you doing here? - I'm on my break. If you're alone, you have no breaks. Go out to the front desk. - Canoes. - Good, you still shouldn't be here. - If you're alone, you always... - Stand in reception. I know. When I was little, I'd stand there till my feet went numb. Yeah, but you didn't have a choice. - But this is your choice. - No, this is my summer job. Yeah, for now. But then... - Then what? - Then it'll be your choice. - Yeah. - Can you do the dishes as well? - And I'm waiting for the port wine. - Coming right up. - Can we start before it gets dark? - Of course. - He's just setting up the pitch. - There you go. - And the port wine. - On its way. Can you hand them out. - Are you so understaffed? - At the moment, yes. - You can't carry on like this. - My wife's at a school reunion and my brother's travelled to... - Hello! - Yeah. Yeah, port wine. Let's go through the rules, so there's no misunderstandings. - Hello? - Barbro Östling? - Hi, this is Oskar Waldemar. - From the guesthouse. I... I... I'm married to Liv Wal... Well, her maiden name was Persson. I'm trying to contact Liv... Because... I think... I tried to reach her, I think she's turned her mobile off. I thought... if you're at the reunion, maybe she was there? - No, she's not here. - She isn't? - No... okay then. Thanks, have fun. - Bye. - Hi. - Hi. - Something to drink? Beer? Wine? - Water. I don't have any money right now, but it's coming. In September. Then I'll inherit my mother's guesthouse. How... How's Timo doing? He's in jail waiting to be sentenced for a crime you asked him to commit. - How do you think he's doing? - He'll get three, max four years. A decent year's salary should be enough to stay quiet. Yeah, erm... Shall we say... 30 000 euro? 35 000. 40 000. 45 000. It'll be the best paid three years of Timo's life. - 50 000. - 45 000. I won't inherit any more. We can say 45 000, on one condition. Deliver this bag to a restaurant owner in Mariehamn. - What's in the bag? - Do you want to know? Deliver the bag and we'll settle for 45 000. I want to buy myself out of this, not cause myself more problems... Or we say 50 000? - Are you expecting someone? - No. Open it. - Hi. - Liv! - What are you doing here? - Nothing. Liv. Wait. It's not what you think. - Liv, wait. - Stop it, I want to go. Not before you tell me why you came? I know there's something still there between us, and you feel it too. The letter you wrote... He ripped it up, Oskar. Didn't you know that? He wrote a new letter that made me hate you. I wonder what would've happened if I got your letter. That's why I came. What are you doing? We're fully booked and here you are. - Are you drunk? - No. You're behind the bar tonight, it says so in the schedule. You'll probably take over this place sooner than you think. What do you mean? Where are you going? I'm thinking of applying to theatre school in the autumn. - I want to be an actor. - Take the kitchen. I'll take the bar. Didn't you hear what I said? I don't want to stay here. I don't want to be like you. I want to go to Stockholm... Quiet! Hasse. - Do you want something? Coffee? Beer? - No thanks. - We have some leftovers from today? - No thanks, I'm good. - This is for you. - Thanks. - What's your name? - Lars Waldemar. The guesthouse. - Okay, see you. - Wait. I know who you are. Wait here. Keep going. To the left. - Where's the rest? - What do you mean? There's something missing from the bag. I've not touched anything. I know you need money, fucking arsonist! I swear, I've not touched anything! I've not touched anything, I promise! I swear, I've not taken anything! Get lost. Go! Okay, thanks. - Hi. How was it? - Good. Okay. So what do you do? Ahh the usual. We ate, drank... chatted and felt a bit shameful. Is it true what they say, you fall back into your old ways? - Yeah, I guess it is. - What are your old ways? I don't know. I was quite hesitant and shy. - A bit of a goodie two shoes I guess. - But you're not like that anymore. Goodie two shoes is the last thing you are. Or shy for that matter. - I don't think so. Not anymore. - No. I'm really glad that you're home. "The bathroom, a little boy and a girl." "a girl." - Hi. - Hi, what are you up to? I'm rewriting my play. - What's her name? - What? Your shirt. Was she a blonde? I just wanted to let you know that I'm back. Okay, so you're back as well. - What are you up to? - I'm rewriting my play. Okay, close it down, I need the computer. What the hell? Five minutes more. No. Come on now. - I've just got home. - Manne! - Here you go. - Okay. - Got a bit crazy in Helsinki I see. - Just got home, not changed yet. If you look like that, I'd love to see what the hotel room looks like. - Don't take that tone with me, okay. - Who did you meet? - That's none of your business. - Who did you meet? I'm not explaining myself to you. I told you to cut the crap. I've already warned you once. One wrong step and you're done! Tell me who you met, otherwise I'll ring the police about you and Timo. - You're joking? - No. - What the hell are you doing? - What's it going to be? Timo's wife made me deliver a bag to a criminal restaurateur in Mariehamn. It went as you see. - Timo's wife? - Tina. Timo was arrested for arson. He'll keep quiet about me if I pay his wife. It was her I met. Change your shirt if you're gonna work. And what about you? Have you never done anything wrong? Ever let a loved one down? You don't have any secrets? Go away. I can't be bothered anymore. If only I'd have known... that you'd planned to show up. I don't want any explanations. You know what? I can't wait for you to go back to Stockholm. I've been thinking about the letter. If you'd have got it. If you'd have followed me? If we'd be together? Can you hear yourself? If I'd have got the letter... It's so damn long ago. - Fucking Oskar. I'm gonna talk... - No, no you're not. It's over. There's no point anymore. Today's mail. - Thanks. Hey, Cecilia... I... - I was upset about some other things. - You didn't have to yell at me. No, I know that. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about it. - What did you mean then? - I meant that... I shouldn't have shouted. I should have been calm. It was stupid of me. But you still meant it? Yes. I think you're a little too young to leave the island. Cecilia! Hello? Hi. Okay, no I'll come straight away. Okay, bye. - Jonna? - Yeah? Ta-ra-ra ta-ta-ta! - Are you finished? - It just needs a read through. - Feel the weight of it? - Yeah. - Open it. - I don't have time now honey. I promise I'll read it later. Good luck with the read through. "Marionettes" by Manne Wahlström. "2013. Page one. Interior, cafe. Day, flashback." "Magnus, voice over". "It doesn't have to mean anything!" "Magnus, a composed man in his thirties..." Rosén has had to back down. No I want to hear what you have to say. - What happens after I've explained? - It depends what you tell me. I'll tell you what happened to Gunnar. - How do I know you won't sell? - You're just gonna have to trust me. That's not enough. Otherwise I'll sell to Rosén straight away. You don't really have a choice. Gunnar and my dad were a couple of drunks. Yes they were. And my dad was a real fucking pig. The more he drank, the more he beat us. He beat my mum, he beat my brothers... I think those of us who can handle their spirits, need a little first before you continue. That day, dad and Gunnar were already drunk before they took the boat out. Mum asked me to mix the booze with water. But I was sick of his drinking, the violence, all the lies and shit that we had to keep quiet about, so that no one found out. So I didn't mix the booze with water. I just thought... he can drink himself to death. And they left? Yeah. When they'd been out for a few hours, I started to get worried. You regretted not mixing in some water. So I took the boat and... went out to look for them. Gunnar Pahkinen! You thought you'd get away with it! You thought you could fool me! You fucking idiot! You leave my wife alone! Hear me? Leave my wife alone! I knew it that same day. I knew that he'd not just fallen into the water. - Have you told anyone before? - I couldn't tell. I didn't dare to. I'm sorry Mildred. I stayed here so that I could find out what happened to Gunnar that day. This is my prison. You could have told the truth. The police, I would have protected you. But you chose to protect your family. And now I'm passing my punishment over to you. If you don't want me selling to Rosén, you must stay on the island. As long as you're here, I won't sell. We close the 14th, Beatrice the 15th, and you're off the 16th. - Are you sure about that? - Yeah, I've checked the calendar. I mean that I'm leaving. Your life's in Stockholm, you can't stay here. Why not? Guys, meeting in the bar. Now. So... listen, I have good news. Mildred's not selling. She's going to stay here. No Rosén. - How do you know that? - Because I've taken care of it. - You didn't sleep with him, Jonna? - No! - You've not bought the place either? - No. No, she's staying here. But she's not selling either. - Is that all you're going to say? - Yep. - That's great news! Well done sis! - Well done! I'm ringing here. Oskar Waldemar. You've identified the body? Yeah, carry on. Thanks. Thanks a lot. - Oskar? - They've identified the body. - Is it Mauritz? - It was Gunnar. Mildred's Gunnar. He had a fractured skull. He must have hit it on something. It wasn't Mauritz they found, it was Gunnar Pahkinen. It was Gunnar! Let's drink to that. Mildred's staying put. That's better than being ruined. - Fantastic. Cheers. - Cheers. I'm just... It was Gunnar Pahkinen they found. But how? They found the body where you dumped Mauritz. Mauritz was so drunk when Gunnar fell overboard, he didn't remember where. It was the exact same spot where I dumped Mauritz. - Isn't that fantastic? - It's unbelievable. - Petra, I'm off the hook. - We'll talk when we see each other. - Take care, bye. - Bye. I KNOW OSKAR! I KNOW WHAT YOU DID!
