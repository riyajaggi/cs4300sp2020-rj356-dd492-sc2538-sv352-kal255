 "From the day this is read, until the closing in September, shall you three run the guest house together." There must be a law against leaving your children out of your will. Sure, if you have ownership. - What are you doing here? - Saying a last goodbye. - I'm not letting you in. - You should be ashamed. What's going on with the pool? I could stick around and fix it. That's a bad idea. - Are you still upset that I left? - I just think it's a bad idea. - Do you want a pool? - I don't want you here.

 - Hey, he's alive. - Who? Mauritz, your dad. No, Konrad. He's not alive. - Do they know the cause? - Probably an electrical problem. It'll be okay. What now? - I guess we won't be open today. - No, but... - Our paychecks. - The insurance will cover it. Yeah yeah, we'll talk later. It's Jonna. Say something after the beep, or don't. Hi. Great. Thanks, bye. Jonna Waldemar! Is this about next season? The contracts are ready. There won't be a next season. I quit.

 I got the lead role in a movie. Here are the keys for rooms five, six and seven. Yes, it starts tomorrow at ten, when the instructor arrives. - Do you have internet access? - Yes. - There's no pool here? - Sadly, no. But we have the ocean. Everything you need to know is there. Where's Dad? Mum? What's going on? Grandma's death turned everything upside down. Your dad's sorting it. So it's... If Beatrice asks about Jonna, tell her you don't know anything. - What should I say? - Just say... She probably won't ask. Mårtensson thought is was a little empty here. Lasse is in Stockholm, he had something to take care of. We heard. I'm sorry. And Oskar? In Mariehamn. He's coming soon. And Jonna went back to Luleå? No. No, she's... I know that things are upside down, but I've done my best. Believe me. The fact is none of your siblings are where they should be, which is here. And they have until nine o'clock tonight. Yes, I know. THICKER THAN WATER What the hell. - Who is it? - I don't know. Don't answer it. Honey, don't do it! And I was so horny. I'll be back. - Hi. - Jonna? - I'd like you to reconsider. - You didn't have to come to tell me. I had to. You don't pick up the phone. There's nothing more to say, I've made up my mind. Then I'm asking you to reconsider. I'm sorry, I'm not taking part in Mum's cynical games. - You're talking as if you know Mum. - Are you saying I didn't? You haven't spoken with her since Mauritz disappeared. - "Mauritz"? You don't say "Dad"? - That bastard was named Mauritz. - He got what he deserved. - How do you know? - What do you mean? - Can you move your arm? You still believe he'll be back, don't you? Maybe. You don't think it's strange that he vanished without saying bye? - He didn't even say bye to me. - You were Daddy's girl. And you were Mama's boy! She never helped me with anything. She knew her limits. Maybe you should as well, instead of chasing a dream. - Get out, Oskar. - What do you want in life, Jonna? - No one sees your plays. - Maybe I'm okay with that. - How long will you keep this up? - Not so much longer. I got a film role. The producers are flying in today to sign the contract. Have you seen the coffee? - Today? - Yes. It's all that matters. Not Mum trying to sort things from her grave. - You don't want to let Mum win? - Maybe. - Jonna! - Here's your coffee. Jonna... It's your career, but it's only one summer. There will be more roles. - Look at it like a sacrifice. - A sacrifice? Why should I give up my career for her sake? It's my life we're talking about. I'll lose everything. I stayed behind and took care of her. I've held the family up. Do you have any idea what I've done for you, for Lasse and Mum? Oskar, take it easy. Here you go. -Jonna, please, come back. - Oskar, you heard her... - Stay out of it. It's a family thing. When were we a family? Aren't you going to have coffee? Jonna? You're doing the right thing. I think it's over between us. - Of course it's not. - No Jonna, no inheritance. I wonder if Mum was counting on that. - Part of a plan? That's sick. - Don't say that. Nothing changes in here. In here you know that everything remains the same. Everything I've built is slipping through my fingers. It's as if I've been dreaming. When I try to remember, it's gone. But I won't disappear. - Hi, this is Lasse. - The chef fell asleep at the cooker? Hi, Bjarne. No one knows what happened. It was an accident. But my conscience is guilt free, and won't be paying your debts. I want my money. - Yeah, you'll get it. - The clock is ticking, Lasse. Are you joking? Her career? - Don't give up. She must come back. - She's gotten a film role. The hotel is fully booked. Who will collect all these invoices? - I don't know. - No, you don't know. Are you just going to give up? We have until tonight. She'll be here by nine o' clock. - We have to get her here. - Who? Jonna! Oskar, are you listening? Do we have a plan B? No, we don't. - Hi. Have you seen Kim? - No. Maybe she's at the beach? Okay. 19th century style. You said I should call and make a reservation, and I did. - Hi. Welcome. - Hello. Nice. Hi, Erik. No, it's no problem. Follow me and we'll get ice cream. This is all a bit old school. - When is breakfast served? - Seven to ten, or whenever, sleep in. - Do you have wi-fi? - We had it before Grand in Stockholm. You can try to crack the password, or it's also on this piece of paper. Perfect. Girls, let's see the room. - Here are the keys. - Thanks. - Are you already back? - Yes. - Where is Jonna? - We're never going to speak again. - She said no? - A definite no. She got a film role. I can talk with her. You make everything personal. Jonna needs flattering. Not someone nagging all the time, like Mum. Hi, Jonna. Congratulations on the film role. - Thanks. - It's so cool. Congratulations. We miss you. It feels empty out here. I guess you've spoken with Oskar. I'd have done the same, if it hadn't all gone to hell in Stockholm. - How? Is it something with Kim? - No, Kim is fine. The restaurant burned down, Jonna. I'm insured, so it'll be fine. But this is about the guest house. Beatrice is coming tonight. You need to be here. We need your signature. Beatrice won't be here the whole time. You can go to Luleå. Luleå? We're not filming in Luleå. I have to go to Stockholm and Germany. We have nothing here any more, none of us. Do you understand? I understand, Lasse. I'm sorry, but I can't let this chance go. Jo...? Did it get personal? - Hi. - Hi. It's so nice you could come. - Hi. Ralph. - Hi. Jonna. Have a seat. We just want to run through some things with you. The majority of our financing comes from Germany. We sent your audition tapes to our German co-producers. It's a routine thing, but they have to approve all the castings. We want you, so don't worry. The contract will just take some time. - Bureaucracy, you know. - German bureaucracy. - Do you want anything? Coffee? Tea? - Yes, I can have something. - Coffee? - Yes. PLANNING TO GET OUT OF HERE. NEED MONEY. - What are you doing here? - Sunbathing, I thought. This is my property. Didn't your father tell you where the border is? It's here. Stay on your side. - It's in the shade. - Show respect for our privacy. - I have insurance for this. - We await the fire investigation. - The employees need their pay checks. - Did you speak to Larsson? - Yes, I met with him. - Wait for the fire investigation. So you're waiting on his report? And the money... As soon as the investigation is complete we'll make an assessment. - I'm sorry, Lasse, but it's... - Thanks. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. - Can you help me? - With what? To the left. - Here's your coffee. And then this. - Thanks. Dad. I... Cecilia, don't worry about us. Mum and I, we're... There's nothing. Everything is gone. What'll happen with the guest house? Shouldn't you be at reception? This is Jonna. Say something after the beep, or don't. - When is Beatrice coming? - Nine o'clock. He doesn't waste time. If there's a pulse, it's okay. Jonna isn't answering. Did you and Lasse talk about... Hi. Did you talk about what you're going to do? Poison a guest and say Jonna followed along to hospital. - Do you think Beatrice will buy it? - Do you think you're funny? - No. - No. - A few hours left. What do we do? - Tell him your plan, Oskar. - Which? - No, nothing. We... Can you please take care of the bar, Lasse? Thanks. - Do you always work? - I'm making money. You should have seen what happened. It was totally crazy. You know the old lady over there. She started yelling at me. - Mildred? Were you on the wrong side? - Apparently. We avoid them. Both of them. Fredrik as well. - So they're really strange? - No, we just avoid them. Okay. Thanks. - A whiskey sour, please. - Hi. Are you sure? It's always been my starter. It's never let me down. Once, maybe. But I'm not telling you about that. - How about your husband? - He's gone to bed. - Maybe it's the country air. - Probably. - When do you close? - The bar closes at eleven. - What's the bartender do after that? - He goes to sleep. All by himself? You're with your husband, I'm at work. Maybe give that some thought? Coward. Are you ready for the verdict? Hey, I've been thinking. You and I can run the guest house. Forget Jonna. Mum would've wanted it. We just need to convince Beatrice. She has to understand that the will was written by a sick person. - Don't talk like that about Mum. - How's that? - Stop. You didn't know her. - Yes, she was my mum also. - We have to be constructive. - When was her birthday? - When was Mum's birthday? - You think you're on your own here? - When was her birthday? - I did what I had to. Forget it! You don't remember. I always had to call and remind you. And then I had to hear Mum say: "Lasse always remembers my birthday." I had to bite my tongue so I wouldn't hurt her feelings. Be the martyr, Oskar. I looked after you, you know that? And then you left. - What should I have done? - You should've stayed, or taken me. You were my big brother, Lasse. - Hi. Am I interrupting? - No, not at all. - Come in. - Anything to drink? Coffee? Whiskey? No thanks, I'm driving. Well, you're here. Jonna? We been talking, Lasse and I, and... We want to honour Mum's wishes. But we were thinking of proceeding, just the two of us. Oskar means that he and I could run the guest house together. - What do you mean? - Maybe we could alter the conditions? The conditions are set. It's Anna-Lisa's last wish. I understand. But we feel that Mum would've approved. I know what Anna-Lisa wanted, and it's stated in the agreement. Jonna isn't here. Is she? You knew that all the siblings needed to be here. You had plenty of time. Beatrice! How can you be so insensitive. This is our inheritance. Does Jonna have to refuse a film role? Oskar and I can run it alone. Lasse, there's nothing I can do. It's a binding agreement. I'm sorry. It's not going to happen. Hi. Shall we get this over with? - No way! - Please, Kim. It's just one summer. Easy for you to say. How long have I been away from Stockholm? It's home! We have nothing! The restaurant is gone. Yes, sorry. The film has been postponed, and suddenly I had time. - So you're back in East Berlin? - I'm looking a the Berlin Wall now. It's a packed schedule with weekly reports. No days off. Otherwise no inheritance. - What made her change her mind? - Not sure. I don't understand her. - I've never understood her. - Will she stay? Can we trust her? I don't know. - Hi, it's Beatrice. - Hi, this is Lasse. - I need to talk to you? - Is it about the report? No, it's about my restaurant, or the outstanding pay checks. Yes, I heard what happened. I'm sorry about that. - What do you mean? - I'll get the insurance money. It'll be taken care of, but it's taking some time. I need a loan. Not for long, just a little. - Borrow against the guest house? - Yes, if it's possible. Sure, if you can show an insurance statement, then it's possible. - Thanks for helping. I'll call you. - No problem. Bye. - A new chapter, albeit a brief one. - Cheers to that. You can't leave if a role comes up. You've signed the paper. Oskar, I know what an agreement involves. We haven't been struggling all this time without you here. Enjoy it. - We have time to do other things? - In your case, whatever. - Just not in the kitchen. We don't... - Want to start a fire? Ha ha. I'm kidding. I'm just kidding, Lasse. Sorry. - You have insurance that covers it? - Yes, I have insurance. I was thinking of fixing the pool. - Excuse me. - We never finished it. If the kitchen is off limits, and you won't show us how to run the place, I might as well fix the pool. It shouldn't take long. - No, I don't think so. - You're not the only one who decides. Jonna agrees. Two against one. Guests complain. They want a pool. - Maybe it's not a bad idea. - Three against one. - No, that's what I say. - No, that's your answer. - Come on, It'll be fun. - It's for the guests. - They can go to the ocean to swim. - Isn't it time we take care of it? The swimming instructor says it's too cold. - We have to work together. - There won't be a damn pool. Period. Does everyone understand? - Hi. - Hi. Are you going to shoot us and take the inheritance for yourself? - Where's Lasse? - I don't know. - What do you want? - I thought we could talk. I've made a plan for the season. The hours are evenly distributed. If we work hard, we save on labour. It's the only way to cut costs. - Liv and I will do the books. - And who made you the boss? He's done it before, Jonna. Should we get started? Liv and Cecilia can hold the fort. You and I are going hunting. Oh yeah. - Want to join, Jonna? - No, I don't like murder. But you eat meat. Yeah, but I'm not a big fan of the actual murdering. - It's been a long time. - We don't hunt in jeans. - What? - We don't hunt in jeans. Go change. - Forget it. - Just put something else on. Beatrice takes care of the books. We have invoices that need to be paid. Since you're not going hunting, maybe you can take care of the invoices? Here, you can take the car. You might hit Gustafsson's barn on the other side of the water. - It doesn't work. - Give it to me. You know how this works? Whoever hits the most birds... doesn't have to clean them. There's nothing wrong with the gun. Remember what I said about the guest house having potential? It's all about marketing. We need to update the menu. - We? - Local ingredients give a nice touch. We want to attract new types of guests. It's not about the amount of people. It's about the money per guest. - It can be a lucrative business. - Yes, that doesn't burn down. I'm here for the whole summer, so you'll have to let me be involved. - We have to work together. - The way you are. You're not serious. I'm trying to be service-minded. There's no harm in being nice. We do things differently. I'm sure it works in Stockholm. But out here we offer out guests clean rooms. They want to bike, give them bikes. They want to fish, give them boats. If they're miserable and horny, we damn hell don't give them our dicks. Can you go get that? I have a better idea. When the season is done, sell your share to me. So I can continue to run the guest house like I've always done. - You sure you want to sell? - Jonna wants to. She's not staying. I can even go as far as letting you keep a certain percent. If we get make a profit in the future, you'd get a share. You can go back to Stockholm. Kim wants to get out of here soon. What do you say? Let's make a gentleman's agreement that you sell. - Two-nothing. - Two-nothing. Good hunting, I see. Maybe due to a good night's sleep? - Is the family swimming? - No. They did yesterday. It was so cold their toes were almost frozen. You should really have a pool installed. - Hi. - Hi. And you're suppose to be the restaurant owner? How's this go then? Well, the restaurant owner doesn't have to gut and clean birds. You start with finding the breastbone. Try it. - Like that. And then... - The entire breastbone should show. - All the way to the bum? - Yes, Lasse. All the way to the bum. Like that. Then we make a cut here. Okay! You've done this before. Then we work the skin down with our hands. Try it. - Yeah, that looks good. - Why hasn't he finished the pool? He lost interest. You left. He put the tools in the shed, and they've been there since. That looks good. Now cut out the breast fillets. On all four, please. The landowner was here at Easter, and he ate up a half ton of... Excuse me. Charlotta Ivanova, I never had a chance to greet you. If I give you my hand, you'll take the elbow and shoulder as well. I don't have any luck today. Charlotta Ivanova... - God! I'm sorry. - We're working here. - Yes. Hi. - Can I help you? It's about an outstanding bill. - You had a workshop at Waldemar's. - Speak with our treasurer. Mikael, there's an unpaid bill here. - Jonna! Are you Jonna Waldemar? - Yes. You and my sister went to high school together. Lotta. Ah, Mikael Rosén. Hi! Good to see you. - What are you doing here? - Debt collecting. Jonna is an actress. At Dramaten in Stockholm. - Sure! - Hi. - Hannes. Director. - A pleasure. I work in Luleå now, at Norrbotten's theatre. You're here for your mum's burial. My condolences. - I'm here for the guest house too. - Are you burying the whole house? No, we're going to run it. I've become a hostess. - But it's just for one season. - Are you kidding? - Forget it. It's complicated. - But you're here for the season? She's here for the whole season. - Do you know the play? - Yes, I do. I'm so damn angry with you. You've supported me about the pool, nodding and being agreeable. But now when... All of a sudden you've changed your mind. - Oskar, two things. - Start with one. Yes, I'll start with one. I always supported you about the pool because I knew it was important. But I've never understood why. People can swim in the ocean. Shut up. You're not letting Lasse in to be involved in the guest house. He's right. Let him build it. Who cares? - Was that number two? - No, I'll tell you number two. What if he's changed? What if your immature behaviour has something to do with your childhood? - No! - He's trying. Give him a chance. Nice of you to say. It's so kind of you to give people a second chance. Lasse is the same as always. He has his sight on something. - It's something he's looking for. - And that is? - Isn't it obvious? - Are you joking? I just think you should keep your distance. Are you serious? - Oskar? - Good night. Yes. What the...? Hey, honey. Wasn't Lasse supposed to be working reception? Damn it! Lasse, stop it! Stop! It'll be fine, Oskar! - The guests are complaining! - They'll be happy when it's done. - Shut it off! - Move! - What? - Shut it off! Take it easy. You should be in reception. I didn't make a plan because it's fun to do. - A pool take planning. - Take it easy. I have everything we need. It'll be my project, Oskar. - Sorry. I just take a shower. - The window in number 17 is stuck. Okay, I'll fix it. Wait. Room 17, isn't that the eager beaver with the kids? Yes. Just hit the window frame, that should fix it. Hi, great. The window is stuck, we almost ran out of air last night. - We'll take care of it. - Great. I'll take the kids swimming. - Bye. - Bye, girls. - Hi. - Hi. I'm here to fix the window. - Was it both? - Yes. We've tried that. Forcing them doesn't work. - I'll need some tools. - Shall I wait here? - No, I have a spare key. - Hey... I thought about what you said yesterday. It was the right decision. Okay. - The window in room 17 is stuck. - No! - Did it work out with the window? - Yes. Guys, in three weeks there is a premiere of Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard" in Mariehamn. And in one of the starring roles, as Varja you'll be seeing... me! You go out to get a bill paid and come back with a part in a play. I'm just helping out an old friend. And the bill has been paid. - It's here on the island. - Oskar, you don't have to go. - But I'm coming. - Thanks. - Hi, it's Lasse. - It's Larsson with the fire service. - What is it that doesn't look good? - It can be arson. - We started an investigation. - What the hell are you saying? I'm saying that I can't rule out arson. - Hi. - Hi. My God, you look awful. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Just fixing something. I just have to ask you. What did you mean earlier? The thing about having sacrificed so much for Lasse and me. - Nothing. - Okay. Don't think I'm just going to take off and abandon you. I'm here. I won't turn my back on you. - I just want you to know that. - Thanks. Sleep well, I'll see you in the morning. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
