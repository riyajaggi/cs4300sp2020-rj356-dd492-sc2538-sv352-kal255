 TITLE: Tjockare än vatten, ep 107 STORY: 20615909 LANG: ENG How about Mauritz? Your dad. My brother. - Don't forget him. - No, Konrad, it's... Your mum was not alone in this. Your dad also contributed. - Bless his memory! - This is in fact Mum's funeral. When the hell will you show my brother a little respect? When in the hell will you get him a gravestone? - We'll talk about that later - Back off! Calm down. What was I saying?

 Right, I was talking about the island that I love more than anything. - We can begin tomorrow. - With what? The project. We can start building next spring. Which Rosén are you seeing? Mikael, but we're not seeing each other. Seriously, we're not. For years the Rosén family has been trying to buy the guest house. And now you're in bed with him. - Are you fucking? - No, we're not fucking. Did he have a budget? - What the hell... - Manne! Hi, it's Lasse. Do not torch the restaurant. Abort. Ring me so I know you've heard this.

 What was that? - We've found something else. - Okay? We found the remains of a body. The police are on their way now. I thought you should know. Mum... They found Mauritz. THICKER THAN WATER Thanks. Cut the crap, we know you've had financial troubles for a few years. But you found a creative solution. You burn down your restaurant and collect the insurance money, and the problem is solved. Who hasn't had financial problems the last few years? - Is that your evidence? - No, it's a motive. Why would I burn down my restaurant when things were turning around? Not according to the books. That's how it is in the restaurant business. You weren't there, you didn't hear the praise or read the reviews. Do you know this guy? No, who's that? Timo Lehto. What's your connection to him? None. Does he have something to do with the fire? So your claim is that you've never seen this person before? I've never seen him before, no. I just want to point out that the punishment for arson, or third-degree arson like this, can be four to six years in prison. You have a person without any connection to me, and a mobile that's lost or stolen. But you don't know where it is, or who used it. I didn't set my restaurant on fire. Can I go now? Thanks. BODY FOUND IN JUNGFRU COVE We used to go there by boat. - Will you go to him? - Yes. I have to apologise and make things right. Why? It was my fault. Have you thought about apologising? It's remarkable that he hasn't reported you. - Is it? - Yes, it is. I guess I'll go with you and apologise. Do you think I'll let you make things worse? I won't touch him, I promise. No, you won't, because you're not going. When did you get in? I don't know. I didn't sleep well. What time is it? Twelve. What did the police say? Do they know who it is? They think they do. - Who was it then? - I don't know. Hi, Mum! Thanks, but you don't have to sing. - Damn... - Thanks. I miss you too. What Dad got me? Not much, but... He has his hands full right now. Congratulations, sweetheart. Kim? Kim... We're going to celebrate with the family later. With cake and... presents. What do you want? Money. That's boring. Something else. I want to go to Copenhagen. I know that you miss Mum. But I can't afford that now, okay? Okay. What did Mum get you? I don't know. She sent it to Stockholm. She never got our address here. Hey... It's a room for three people? That's right. - We'll just get a spare bed. - Perfect. Hi, and welcome to Waldemar Guest House. Are you Lasse? My name is Oskar. Lasse is my brother. Alright. My husband, Leo, who's out there with my son, has said such nice things about you all. And we're finally here. - How nice. Welcome. - Thank you. We built a tree house there, and down there was smuggler's cove. With real gold? Yes, of course there was. Let's go see Mum. The search for gold can wait. Thanks. Can you take this? Let's go this way. You can really sense the history within these walls. Summers as a child, it... Such places stick in your memory. It's a lot to take in. It's a pleasure that you're visiting us again. This place saved me. I learned about responsibility and... I'll never forget those summers, and your mother was fantastic. She saved a lot of people. - Welcome back. - Thanks. - This is yours, right? - Thank you. See you. - Hi. - Hello. Can I come in? Sure. - What a nice place. - Thanks. Look at that view. Is that a Kjell Ekström painting? Yes, it's beautiful. Every home should have one. Everyone can't afford it. Can I get you something? No thanks, I'm fine. I... I just wanted to make sure you'd be alright for the premiere. Are you in pain? No... A little makeup and everything will be fine. I came because... I wanted to apologise for everything. It wasn't your fault. I hope you didn't send your boyfriend to beat me. - No. - You're not a fault for what he does. Will you report it? What would you do? I don't know. I guess I have every right to. Why didn't you say anything? What do you mean? Who you were. That you own half of Åland. That you and Oskar don't like each other. Why didn't you tell me? Now I know why you never drove up to the house. Maybe that was foolish. Can't we be honest with each other? Can I trust you if you hide things from me? If we're doing business together... The biggest problem is the your boyfriend beat me up. - He's not really like that. - Is that why you came here? To see how this affects our future business together? Bye. What did the Duke of Åland say? Don't you realise you did something wrong? That it's not okay? - Will he report me? - Next time, I'll report you. I'm sick and tired of your behaviour. Jonna! Jonna, did he say he wouldn't report me? - What about the premiere? - You don't have to go. But I want to. Hey, I want to see you. I'm sorry. I don't think he'll report you. - Have you seen Liv? - No, I don't know where she is. Damn... Hi, it's Oskar Waldemar. I'm ringing about the body on Åland. I got this number from the police officer who was here. Ritva Viljanen? But she's the one leading the investigation? Yes. No, there are just a lot of people here that'd like to know. No, you don't have to give her a message. I'll try again later. Thanks. Were you looking for me? Do you remember this? No one thought you'd make it. Why not? We were young and strong. And you cheered for us. No one thought you'd get along. Everyone thought you'd kill each other with the paddles. How was everything in Stockholm? They think I'm involved. They have a suspect in custody. Do you know who? No idea. I really need your help, Liv. Did you not get any cake? That's right. I'll handle it. Cecilia bought a present as well. - About that... - You didn't get a present either. Exactly. I don't care what he gets me. It doesn't matter. The point is, he forgot. I'm sick of him. He leaves whenever he wants. How old are you now? 13? It's my dad. I'm allowed to complain. I might go to Copenhagen. Mum said I can come whenever I want. When will you be back? Where are you going? I'm going to help Lasse with finding a gift for Kim. We'll celebrate her later. Is it Kim's birthday today? Yes. And you're helping Lasse... Because he forgot. Because he asked me to. Birthdays can be forgotten, but his own daughter's? It's not so strange considering the restaurant. It's still strange. Is there a problem with me going? - No. - Good. Maybe we should get something from us as well. Lasse never got anything for Cecilia. Sure, an apostle spoon when she was four months old, but he didn't come to the christening. Okay! I'll get something for Kim. Thanks. God. We have a new coffee machine in the meeting house. You don't have to bring your own thermos. The remains are being analysed. They took a DNA sample from me to check if it's Mauritz. It'll take a couple weeks. I've tried ringing, but I couldn't reach the person in charge. Why expect the worst? Wait until you hear the results. I'll have to wait... Meanwhile I've seen the way Liv looks at Lasse. Surely, that's the least of your worries. Do you think she want him? Are you able to see such things? That's the thanks I get after all I've done for Lasse. - It's not about that. - What's it about then? Suddenly Liv feels like she's 18. It's like a damn time machine. Unfinished business. What? Unfinished business? The past affects us more than we think. - What is it? - Lasse! She's turning 17, not 12. No more princess dresses and stuffed animals. Help me out. Do you have any ideas? This. Come on, are you mad? I don't want her to be that grown up. No. How much is that? A dress will be perfect. This one. This is cute. Yeah. You don't know what she wants? Sure, I know what she wants. She wants a ticket to Copenhagen. But I can't get her that. This'll be great, we'll take it. You're not going to lose her. Can you wrap is as well? With some bows and... - pink ribbon. - No. Oskar Waldemar. Hello, it's Tommy Fasth from Stockholm police. Hi. We spoke earlier about your uncle's mobile. Right. I have another question. Do you know one Timo Lehto? - Timo Lehto... - Yes? Timo Lehto... No. And your brother has never mentioned that name? We haven't had contact for the past 20 years. He's just here for the summer. I don't understand what this Timo has to do with us? He's in custody for setting your brother's restaurant on fire. But we believe someone else told him to do it. Unfortunately, I can't help you. We'll be in touch. Thank you. - Go and get the present. - Yes, okay. - Hi. - Hi. Hey... Have you heard anything? About? The body they found. No. It makes you wonder. It doesn't have to be Mauritz. Mauritz? How's that? But how will it affect us, the guest house? Word gets around. "Didn't they find a body there?". It's bad publicity. Do you think we'll lose guests? It's in the paper. How did it go in Stockholm? Great. - Is that so? - Yes. Tommy Fasth from Stockholm police ringed. Did he ring? He thinks more people are involved. He mentioned a name I haven't heard in a long time. - Is that right? - Timo. Timo Lehto. The bad boy. You remember him. No. You didn't have to buy anything. Kim should get a present. Are you coming? Yes, we're coming. Let's celebrate Kim. Hurray! - Congratulations, honey. - Thanks. Are you drinking now? You're driving later. - Aren't you coming tonight? - Yes. I can drive. I have the night off. Lasse is serving. I thought it would be nice to see my sister on stage. - Are you coming? - Yes. - Let's drink to that. - Coffee. Cheers. Is it time to open presents? No? Yes? Congratulations! There you go. I hope you like it. What is it? Håkan! Thank you so much. You're welcome. Well... I also have a gift. Happy Birthday, sweetheart. I hope you like it. It's beautiful. You like it? It's really nice. How did you know my size? No problem. - It's beautiful, Dad. - Do you think so? Here's a little something from the rest of the Waldemar family. We realise that you've had to put up with us this summer, so you've earned this. - Thanks. - Happy 17th birthday. What could it be? Are you guys for real? Tickets to Copenhagen. Roundtrip and no set date for the return, so you can visit your mum. Oskar, Liv and Cecilia... - I'm speechless. - Don't mention it. How generous of the lord of the manor. That's great, Kim. Just what you wanted. What a surprise. Nice of you, Oskar. Pass me the bottle. It was nothing. Here you go. Thank you so much. The dress was beautiful, Dad. But it doesn't beat Copenhagen? I'm joking. I'm grateful for the tickets. You said you couldn't afford it, and now I can visit Mum. - I didn't mean it like that. - Then what did you mean? Are you so damn scared that I might like it better there? Are you? Kim... Kim! - What the hell was that? - What? What just happened? Does it make you feel in control? Do you always have to outshine Lasse? Kim was happy, she appreciated it. How could you do that without telling me? You asked me to get her a gift, and I did. Some money maybe... Did you see how happy she was? She wants to see her mom. I expected Lasse to be happy as well, but obviously he wasn't. You can't please everyone in this family. Did you think Lasse would be happy? I wanted Kim to be happy. She doesn't want to be here, and now she doesn't have to be. I didn't think it would be such a big deal. Cecilia told me that Kim wanted to see her mum. You're a kind person, Oskar. What the hell is he doing here? Not only did someone steal my mobile here on the island... I'm also a suspect in an arson investigation. Why the hell would I want to set your restaurant on fire? No one believes that. Why are the police after me? How? You must have told them something. I want to know what you said. Konrad, you're not a suspected of anything. The police are just doing their job. Don't worry. There's something strange? We run a guest house. At least, we try. You're hiding something. I can see it in you. Maybe it's the booze. The booze... Kiss my ass. My mobile is gone. The restaurant burned down, and now they found a body in the cove. What the hell is going on? - What do you mean? - Maybe it's time for you to go home. Maybe it's time you told me what's going on? What were you digging up that night when I went to take a leak? That you put in plastic bags? It's a long way home, Konrad... You took it out to sea. I saw you. We're busy. You didn't go out to sea? No. Well, shit. Poor fool. What was that about? Nothing. You weren't digging that night? Just some crap I forgot about that I had to get rid of. So you were digging it up when Konrad was pissing that night? That's right. Well? What do you think? Is it yours? Yes. But it's an actual sail boat. With actual sails, and an actual rudder. Let's go for a trip. I can't sail. - Here you go. - Thank you. - Hi. - Hi, Lasse. You don't remember me? I used to come here when I was younger. That's great. Welcome back. - Nice to meet you. - My family... My son, Jesper. I showed him where we used to play, and he became ecstatic. Is your mother here? No, Mum passed away recently, so now it's just us siblings. My condolences. She was amazing. She saved a lot of us from the streets. It's remarkable in retrospect. Yes, but have a seat, and I'll get some menus. Wow, what a relief. You aren't a typical theatre fan, are you? I'm sure Jonna wouldn't mind if you didn't go. Actors love acknowledgement. Writers are too, for that matter. I think she'd understand. It's not for everyone. Nothing unites us like hatred, neither love, friendship or admiration. That's what he said. Who? "Antonin Tjechonov". Chekhov. The man who wrote the play that these clowns will... make a mockery of. - That was insightful. - Yes. Who enjoys it when someone lays their dirty hands and filthy fingers on your own flesh and blood? I piss on your bare soul. Are you nervous? Being a little nervous is actually good. I've been freezing all day. All these lines, all these damn lines. Let me help you. Here. - Careful. - There. I didn't come just for the business. I want you to know that. I'll cover it with make-up. It won't show. I want to make a deal. I won't press charges on one condition. Promise that you'll never judge me from what your brothers say. You're quiet. Are you seasick? Thanks. - What would you like? - Sprite. Sprite? Okay. Two red wines and a sprite. Do you know him? No, not really. Who is he? One of those bad boys that Mum used to take in over the summer. You know, from the big city to the countryside. Well, it seems to have helped. Great. Oskar, here. It tastes good when it's free. Cheers. Incoming, one o'clock. - What the hell is she doing here? - She's heading towards us. - Ah. - Hi. Are you here as well, Mildred? Yes, it's something. I might as well say hello to my neighbours. As a Capulet to a Montague? Speaking of neighbours, your kid has a bad habit or crossing the property line. Perhaps you could tell him. You remind me so much of Mauritz. Oskar, here. - Oops... I'll clean it up. - I'll get a dishcloth. - I'll clean it up, it's okay. He can clean it himself. - Was that a good job? - Stop it. Are you happy now? Are you a little idiot that makes a mess like a baby? Clean it up. Clean it up I said! Stop, not here. I've cleaned it. - I cleaned it, I said. - Shut up. Stop it! Are you listening? If you're going to make a mess, you'll clean it up. Hey, hey! Leave it the fuck alone. It's just a reflex. Don't touch the boy. Anything else? If not, we'll take more wine. Good. Who the fuck do you think you are? You damn idiot! How hard can it be... That's enough! What happened? Nothing, it's fine. Are you sure? It'll all be auctioned in August. Oh my God. Moo! - I just want... - Has he proposed? I don't think we're meant to be together. Everyone is talking about our wedding. Everyone is happy for us, but in the end it's just a dream. I'll get us a drink before the next act. And the larger details will be worked out later. I sent them. Thanks. Do you know the Rosén family? Rosén family? I don't. Then what were you talking about? Did you give him acting advice? He needs it. I might as well tell you, it'll soon be official anyway. So you like giving lectures? - You have no right to hit him. - I didn't hit him. - What the hell do you want? - To challenge you. What's the point of that? The point is that you deserve it. What are you trying to prove? What? That you were a bully and still are 20 years later? I suggest we do this. You get to hit me. And I get to hit you. Easy now. You get to hit me first. Then I hit you. Come on. Come on. You're a coward. You don't have the guts. - Coward! - Hey! - Liv! - He needs to leave now! It's nothing. What do you mean nothing? He threatened you. Just let it go. - No! - Liv, let it... Lasse? Your family is welcome to stay the night, but you are not. Is that clear? -Wait a minute... If you don't leave I will call the police. You don't threaten our staff or your family under my roof. Is that clear? Get your seat belt on. Watch your fingers. I thought they were staying five nights. Life has gone by, as if I never lived. You have no strength left, nothing left at all. Nothing... Oh, you... klutz. Congratulations. Thanks. - You're beaming. - Thanks. You're in a class by yourself. I know what you think, but it was nice that you came. I see that they're making an effort, even "the refrigerator". Hi. Hannes wants to say a few words. Okay. I'll be right there. Come here. I'm happy for you. - Don't just say that. - I mean it. Okay. I hope you have fun with Mum. I'm the one who... needs to grow up. Okay? What did you think? - Honestly. - It was great, but that damn Micke... - He "back staged" you constantly. - What do you mean? We took a step forward, so you had to follow, then he'd take another step and you had your back turned... No, you couldn't see me? - Yes, yes, but... - There you are! - Hi. - Where did you go? You know there are two acts? He didn't miss much. Come. You can go, Manne. Jonna? I have to talk to you. What's happened? Did they ring? Who? The police. About Dad? No. - No, they haven't. - Then what's going on? - How was the second act? - Good. Really good. Your new best friend... Mikael Rosén... made Mildred an offer for her property. And the old crow accepted. Rosén and company will be our new neighbours. Sketches and plans will now be realised. With one tiny difference. It happens on Mildred's property. You were so beautiful. It was nice to see. How was the play? Yeah, it was good. When we were kids, Mum was hell bent on helping kids that had a hard life. Every summer a buss would come... full of so called "bad boys" to visit the guest house. Me and Lasse worked, so we had to tend to them. One of those kids... was cast aside. He was bullied... Pushed around, real bad. One day Lasse defended him from the bullies. And literally beat the crap out of them. Timo Lehto... was his name. After that day, Timo would do anything for Lasse. When Lasse calls, Timo comes running like a small dog. There isn't anything Timo wouldn't do for Lasse. Why are you telling me this? It's Timo that was arrested for burning down Lasse's restaurant. The police can't make the connection between Timo and Lasse, but I can. And now you can too.
