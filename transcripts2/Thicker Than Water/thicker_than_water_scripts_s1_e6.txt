 Oskar. This is a funeral. It's your father's funeral. Be glad that you're friends with the only priest here who would participate in the madness. Yes. Just do it, Petra. Heavenly father, we're gathered here today in Jungfru cove to bid our last farewell to Mauritz Waldemar. This is Lasse. Do not torch the restaurant, we're not doing it. Ring me so I know you got the message. Bye.

 - Who was that? - A rock. It looked like you threw a mobile. Such nice drawings you sent. Imagine, you care about my ideas. It's an occupational habit. I see something good, I can't let it be. A bit small, maybe? But it's so charming. Yes, you can live here. And I... Damn. Forget it, I can sleep on the sofa. - Are you going to buy it? - No, I'll just rent it over summer. Are we going to live in the woods and follow a trail to the guest house? - Why don't we just stay there? - Yes, but... It'll be good. Really good.

 Nice. THICKER THAN WATER Excuse me. I'd like to have my room key. Yes, you're welcome. I need the key! Yes, of course. - And lunch? - Twelve. - I found a cabin to rent. - A cabin? Where? On the other side, by Stubbholmarna. No one has lived there for years. It's water damaged. - Yeah, I noticed the smell. - You can get sick living there. It'll work. We can have the windows open. So you've already made up your mind? I live there, and work here. That way we won't run into each other. Can you afford it? Think about it. If you can't afford it, there's no use... But we have to do something. At least I do. Or maybe it's the other way around. That we shouldn't do anything, and just let it be. Can we handle that? You're not that good looking. Let's not make a big deal out of what's happening. Or what happened. No. No. I can handle it, so... Yeah. That's enough. Just a little distance. Wow, shit! - I'm starving. - Good. My god, this is good. Are the others awake? They're about to have lunch. What are we going to do today? I have to work. In the kitchen. - Can't you call in sick? - What? Say that you have a fever. Dengue fever. - You have to stay in bed all day. - No, that won't do. Anyway, I have rehearsal later. Maybe you can give me a hand in the kitchen. - Me? - Yes. Shall I do the dishes while you play theatre? - Yes, can't you? - No, I have to work. - Work? - Yes, I'm writing a play. Oh, okay. I appreciate it very much. - The others as well. - Well... - We're not on vacation. - When you do something creative, people think you don't do anything, that it just appears from nowhere. I have a good idea for a play, I have to get it written down. Anyway, I'm writing it for you. I think you have time to both write and do the dishes. - Scuba divers. - They're diving down to the wreck. I like divers. Great. - Will you get a diver certification? - No, but they can't drink. It'll be less partying for them and more rest for us. - Are there more guests coming today? - A family with two kids on the ferry. Kids. Put them at the other end of the hall so the divers can rest. Hi, welcome to Åland. - Cecilia will help with the check in. - Thanks. Hi. Your daughter told me to talk to you. Bedtime at ten. Lights our at eleven. - How can I help you? - We diving for shipwrecks here. There are some east of here. Let's see. We're here. The wreck is over here. No, we've been there. We were told that the wreck is there, in Jungfru Cove. There are a lot of reefs around there. Can we get in there with the boat and your help? Eh, there aren't any wrecks there. It's not marked, but we believe there's a wreck from the 1800s there. No, there's nothing. As you said, there are reefs everywhere. I'm afraid I can't help get you there. It's impossible, unfortunately. What are you talking about? It can be done. You've been there many times. When you're out fishing. Is there really a wreck there? - We think so. - I sincerely doubt that. How exciting. Of course we'll help them. Oskar will help you. He knows all the reefs. Okay. Great! Summer is so overrated. Is there AC in your car? - Nope. - Damn it... - You don't have to come, my love. - Okay. We're here because of you. I want to be with you. - What? - You're just bored. You hate amateur theatre. I know that. - You despise it. - So do you. It's worse that you even take part in doing it. I can't just run a guest house. I have to do something on my own. It's like curing the plague with cholera. You hate the theatre and you loathe the guest house. Two wrongs don't make a right. My play, on the other hand, you neither hate nor loathe. - Okay. But you're not coming in. - Of course not. - Or you could wait for me in a cafe. - No, I should just follow along. I said that you can't. No! - Why not? - I said you're not allowed in. So you're not letting me in? I promise to keep quiet. - You're not coming in. - No, come on. - Is something going on? - What do you mean? - Hello. - Hi. This is Mikael. He's in the play. Manne, my boyfriend. - Hi. - A pleasure. - Are you coming in? - No, I'm not allowed. He's not allowed. Okay, I'll see you inside then. I'll fix you some coffee. Thanks. - Was that an actor? - Yes. - How bad is he? - The acting skills of a fridge. Okay, see you later. Hi. Here you go. Hey, here are your keys. You can't just leave things lying around! - Out stuff is downstairs. - Get them! What are you waiting for? To check in. - You're not a diver. - No. - May I...? - Yes, I... I'm Sorry. - Two children and two adults? - Yes, exactly. Or we'll have to see. Why can't I have my own room? We've already discussed that. We can't afford it. - I'll pay myself, it's okay. - Stop it. I'm afraid we're fully booked. Petter can be with us. He'll think it's cozy. Take your bag, and we'll go up. One floor? - Yes. - Okay. Are there really no rooms left? Sadly. A closet? That's for the hoover. - The outhouse? - Torn down in 1835. And you? Where do you live? Like you. With Mum and Dad. It's almost as though I can hear Dad's scornful laughter. I thought it would be enough to bury him at sea. There's a rotting wreck there just waiting to be found. - Do you think they'll find him? - You mean, when will they find him. - If they find him. - When. Can it be traced to you? I don't know. I don't know. I have to go. Hello. - Should we go? - I'll just check the boat. - What do you mean? - When we're out, it's on me. The boat's been acting up lately. You can wait at the guest house. - Are you getting diver certification? - No. I filled her up this morning. Don't bother. By the way, have you seen Cecilia and that guy that checked in? No, I don't have time for that. You should check on it. A guest? Is he hitting on her? It's happened a hundred times before. She can handle it herself. - I know the type. - What do you mean? Just check on it. What are you doing? Just start it up. I've filled it up. That's it. You can hop right in. - Do you need help? - Just throw it in. It you find treasure, we split it. Jump in. Alright then. - Are we there? - We're there, yes. - Are you sure? - Yes, go ahead and dive. But this isn't Jungfru Cove. It's the next cove. See? Here's the deal... If you find a wreck, we won't have a minute of peace out here. Those of us who live here like to keep things quiet. So I thought that you could get a little bonus if you choose not to dive here. How about staying at the guest house free of charge? What do you say? That's a good deal? So you're saying that there's something down there? - No... - Why are you waiting? Start it up. Come on. - You having an interesting summer? - I'm at least making some money. What will you do with it? - Savings? - Sort of. - Will you do it every summer? - Well, I live here. You have to go with your family on holiday. Yes. So we're both convicts. - Should we find something to do? - Maybe. - How old are you? - 16. You look older. Cecilia? - I have to go. - Watch out for solitary confinement. Super good! Let's have some coffee. What do you think? I think we have the second act down. - About the sketches. - Right. I don't know what to say. Be honest. It they're crap, then say it. - They're nice. - Nice? Just nice? They're really nice. Is that better? We need to go forward now. How about a coffee when we're done? Have you made reservations again? Will I be sitting for hours... No, no, no. Strictly business. Coffee and a bun. Get your lines right, so we can get out of here. Yes. Hi. Hi. I'm so fucking bored. Oh fuck. Shit. Shit, that's crazy! Amazing. Totally unbelievable. Look. A belaying pin. We found the wreck! - In Jungfru Cove! - We found it! Why did you make the sketches? - I wanted to try out your idea. - We don't even own the guest house. - On day, perhaps. - Maybe we'll own it one day. And to scare you away for sure, I've made this. - What's this? - A budget. - It's makeshift, but not unrealistic. - When did you have time for this? I know it's crazy, but I thought... Why not? - You should have asked yourself why. - Should I have? Yes. Okay. Forget it. Let's gossip about the rest of the cast. Have you heard of anyone sleeping with anyone else? Maybe it hasn't happened. But I think the stage designer is into Elsie. - But... - Okay, okay. Tell me. - I'm telling you. Elsie is gay. - Tell me about the budget. What about it? Okay, but I don't want you to think I'm an idiot. Tell me. 700,000 euros. If we play our cards right, we'll get a loan. In five years we'll break even, then it's a cash cow. But I don't have 700,000. Maybe I have it. We can start tomorrow. Now you've gone completely mad. - Should I take a step back? - Many steps. And, it's something you have to discuss with Oskar. - Is Oskar a visionary? - Perhaps. Jonna, this is why you made the sketches. You think the guest house is old and outdated. How many changes has Oskar made these past few years? - Perhaps not so many, but... - No. I have to take this. - Hello? - When are you coming? - I'm on the way. - Do you have weed? I'm so damn bored. It's under the mattress. What's this, you naughty girl? Do you have archipelago resort porn? - I'm a pervert, I know. - Here. Bingo! What are you doing? The theatre said you stopped an hour ago. I'm practising lines. I'm on the way. I'll be there soon. - With who? - What? Who are you reading with? Elsie. Congratulations on your findings. - Thanks. - Funny. We thought we'd go out ourselves next time. Next time? Aren't you done? No, we'll go out for the whole day. Your brother said it'd be okay to borrow the boat. I'll do my best not to disturb the peace out here. Okay. Okay, let's get the stuff onboard. The police are here. - Hi. Oskar Waldemar. - Tommy Fasth, Stockholm police. A pleasure. Have a seat. I'd like to ask you a few questions about a family member. - Konrad Waldemar. - Konrad? What about him? He claims that he stayed at the guest house between the 27th and 28th of May. Yes, that's right. He claims that his mobile was stolen. It seems unlikely that someone would steal Konrad's mobile, but... Yes, I do remember that he was upset about it. Yes. - Did you find the mobile? - Excuse me, but what's this about? Can you describe your relationship with Konrad? - With us? - Yes. Sporadic. After Mauritz... Dad... died, or disappeared, we haven't had much contact with Konrad. - Any conflicts? - No. A grudge? Things that stir beneath the surface. But you don't think about. No. Is it possible that your father's death made Konrad upset with you? You'll have to explain what this is about if you want my help. Can you describe Konrad's relationship with your brother? - With Lasse? - Yes. They have none. They barely know each other. No disputes that you know of? No. - Where is your brother, Lars? - He's down by... By the pool. Not far. Thank you. - Hi. What are you doing? - Nothing. - And no plans for tonight? - What about it? - He wants to go out and do something. - Wow. - Do you want me to come along? - No... But can you fill in for me? No, I have plans tonight. But some other time, okay? WANT TO DO SOMETHING LATER? (YES, I WANT TO:) With regards to the investigation of your restaurant, we have an interest in your uncle, Konrad. - Really? - How well do you know Konrad? Does Konrad have something to do with the fire? Your business owes a lot of money to many people. Is Konrad one of them? - No, absolutely not. - Is there another motive that would connect Konrad to the fire? Well... Not that I know of. But if you tell me why his name came up in the investigation, - I might be able to help. - Yes... His mobile was stolen at the funeral. We know that someone made a call with his mobile after it was lost. So either Konrad is lying or it really was stolen. Well. Let's start over. Why did you come to Åland? You have debt, the restaurant is about to go bankrupt, and then it burns to the ground while you're here. - Yeah. - Coincidence? Yes. But now we know it was arson. - The only one that benefits is you. - What are you getting at? Of course I'm not happy about losing my restaurant. It was my life's work. I would never set it on fire. It's not the first time it all went to hell. You lost a business before. Other restaurant owners have a bad conscience. Well, at least they have a conscience. Are we done? You're making a mistake. You didn't ask why I'm interested in the mobile. Because you already know, right? Are we done? Prepare to make the trip to Stockholm for further questioning. I came her to be with you. I see only someone that vaguely resembles you. I don't know if it's the theatre or the hotel you're working at. Hey, I want to be with Jonna. My Jonna. - Looking for someone? - Cecilia. Have you seen her? No. Mårtensson is pissed off. Cecilia was supposed to wash the dishes. Lasse mentioned something about a boy. - For real? - Yes. She skipped work for a boy? - Should we worry? - No. I'm sure it's nothing. It's just not like her. - No. - Oskar? No, it's nothing. Cecilia. Cecilia? - Leave it until she comes back. - We need to clean dishes for tonight. - Let me do it. - No, I'll take care of it. I can help, at least. This is clean, right? Yes. Manne? Manne? See how good it's going. What did the police say? Nothing. Routine questioning. He came all the way out here for routine questioning? Yeah, I guess he wanted to get away. Hey, maybe you should rent the cabin. - You've been snooping around my room? - I looked for Manne and found this. Guilty. - Did you take the bottle? - No, but I forgot that. I apologise. - Which Rosén are you seeing? - What? Which member of the Rosén family are you seeing? Mikael, but I'm not seeing him. Honestly, I'm not seeing him. This is ridiculous. I had an idea, and he made a few sketches. It wasn't more than that. The Rosén family has been trying to buy the guest house for years. Your new friend, Mikael Rosén, has mad offer after offer. We've said no. He's made threats about taking it to court, and we still have said no. They want to own everything out here. And now you've jumped in bed with him. Into bed? Are you fucking him? No, we're not fucking. - What did you say? - Nothing. He made a budget as well, right? - No, How the hell... - Manne! Thanks so fucking much. Have you seen Cecilia? She skipped kitchen duty and left with some boy. - Did you check Vassviken? - No. Why? - I'm kidding. - What's with Vassviken? I thought about the old boathouse. It was a bad joke. Forget it. Just finish this. Cecilia! Yeah, I understand, but... I thought maybe you could go down in the price? - I'm keeping the price where it is. - The summer is almost over. Who else is going to rent it? Ah, there's a lot of people that want it. That's not a problem. So someone else is interested? Okay. I'll take one last look and I'll ring you again. Okay. Good. Thanks. Bye. Damn it. - Cecilia, is that you? - Yes. Put on your clothes and come out. How much did you give her? She brought the wine. It was just one bottle. - Fucking idiot. She's 16 years old. - Stop it. We both wanted to do it. You can tell that to your mum. Come on, let's go. Quick. - Where have you been? - They just wanted to be alone. What were they doing when you found them? They were on the sofa. They'd been drinking a little wine. They spilled wine on the floor and I had to ring the landlord. There goes my chance to rent it. Sweetheart. Will you come here? I don't want you to skip work like that. You can see whoever you like, that's none of my business. But don't do anything you might regret, okay? - Where the hell have you been? - I've already told them off. - Who found them? - Lasse. Lasse. Well, I guess everything's settled. Are you working on the play? How's it going? You and your goddamn walls. Can you stop? - I haven't done anything wrong. - Okay. - My God, you're exaggerating. - Yes, I like to exaggerate. - And I'm seldom wrong. - Hey, come here. Forget the damn play. You don't know me. You think you know who I am. Who are you then? The great stage director. You think I'm a normal person. I'm not. "Good rehearsal today. Your boyfriend isn't what I expected. MR." Who's that? MR. Mikael Rosén? Manne, wait. What does it matter? Hey? - Mom and I... - I know. - How are you? - Just fine. Can you work tomorrow? Was that what you wanted to ask me? - So it was Lasse that found you. - Yes. - Just Lasse? - Yes. Why? - Oskar Waldemar. - It's Tommy Fasth from the police. I'm just looking for clarification. I need a list of everyone who attended your mother's funeral. Yes, no problem. May I ask why? Well, we're just crossing names off a list. We know that someone made a call from Konrad's mobile to a person we now have in custody. Do you know if your brother used Konrad's mobile that day? The sooner we find out who's involved the better it is for everyone. No. I didn't see anything. Let's try this. Jonna says you move like a damn refrigerator. Shit. - Yes, Lasse. - Look towards the cove. What? Do you see me? What are you doing there? - I have a question. - Okay? - I want you to answer honestly. - Yes, yes. You can't complain about keeping our distance. No. What would have happened if I had come to Stockholm? You mean 20 years ago? No idea. Have you been drinking? No. Just answer. I don't know. We'd probably still be together. Forever? No idea. Maybe not. But I do know what I should have done. I should have married you, had five children and a decent job. You could never handle that. No, maybe not. Do you know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that we never got to say goodbye. Suddenly, you were gone and we never had closure. It's as though we think we're together when we're not. Yeah, maybe. I have the key to that shed your mother furnished. Will you come here? What about Oskar? So fucking pathetic. - What? - You called someone in Stockholm so they'd burn down your restaurant while you were at Mum's funeral. The police arrested the person you called. They're interviewing him right now. Wait, Oskar. Who have they arrested? I saw you. I say you throw something in the water from the pier. - I didn't throw anything... - You threw Konrad's mobile. I didn't throw Konrad's mobile... It was a rock. - It was a rock. - So if I ask the divers to search, they won't find Konrad's mobile? You come here. You have no money. I take a huge economic risk to help you out. And this is what you do. You come here and destroy. You just take what you want. - What you think you're entitled to. - Oskar... Now listen to me. If you stray just a little... You know what I'm talking about. If you so much as think one thought in that direction, I will call the police and tell them what I saw you throw from that pier. - Hello, hello. - Hi. - Are you done diving for the day? - Yes. - Have a seat. - I don't have time. - Would you like something? - No thanks. I have an assignment for you. Can you take a look around the pier? - We lost something. - We can't, unfortunately. - I'll pay you, of course. - No, sorry. It's going to be a little stressful in the coming days. We found something else. A body. We found the remains of a dead person. We called the police and they're on the way. I thought you might like to know. Bye. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
