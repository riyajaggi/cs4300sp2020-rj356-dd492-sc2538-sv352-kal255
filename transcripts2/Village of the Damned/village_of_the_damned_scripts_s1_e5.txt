BUT THE PEOPLE OF A SMALL TOWN IN UPSTATE NEW YORK, THEY'LL HAVE A DIFFERENT REACTION THESE DAYS. NBC's PAT DAWSON TONIGHT IN DRYDEN, NEW YORK. DRYDEN HAS SEEN IT, AGAIN AND AGAIN -- VIOLENCE, MURDER. IN 1989, THE ENTIRE HARRIS FAMILY WAS EXECUTED IN THEIR HOME. ...TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF FEAR THAT THEY EXPERIENCED. JUST DON'T WANT IT TO BE TRUE.

 1993-- SCOTT HUME STABBED TO DEATH OVER A ROMANTIC GRUDGE. AND THEN AFTER WE GAVE OUR STATEMENTS, THEY TOLD US THAT SCOTT HAD DIED. 1994-- THE LOCAL FOOTBALL COACH SHOT TO DEATH BY HIS DAUGHTER'S EX-BOYFRIEND. PEOPLE WOULD SAY STEVE DIED A HERO. HE DIED A DAD. AND THIS SUMMER, A WORKPLACE ARGUMENT HERE ENDED IN A DEADLY SHOOTING. IT WAS -- IT WAS REAL. I JUST -- I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THIS TIME, IT IS TWO HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS, JENNIFER BOLDUC AND SARAH HAJNEY, BOTH 16, BEST FRIENDS.

 HAVE YOU SEEN SARAH AND JEN? NO, I THOUGHT YOU THREE WERE TOGETHER. WHY? NOBODY'S SEEN THEM. FIRST THING I DID WAS CHECK THE RESIDENCE. I FOUND SOME DAMAGE IN THE BATHROOM. AT THAT POINT, WE KNEW THERE'D BEEN FOUL PLAY AND SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO THE GIRLS. I WAS -- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ONES OF THAT PARTICULAR PERIOD. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ROOTED HERE, THIS IS A SORE SUBJECT. IT'S AN UGLY STAIN THAT PEOPLE WOULD PRETTY MUCH PREFER TO COVER UP AND FORGET. IT'S BEEN 21 YEARS, AND IT'S PRETTY FRESH IN OUR MINDS, STILL, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IT. AND IT SOUNDS STRANGE TO SAY IT, BUT I FEEL OUR COMMUNITY IS STRONGER BECAUSE OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED HERE. WE ARE STRONGER, AND IT'S COME AT A TREMENDOUSLY HIGH PRICE. THIS HOME IN DRYDEN IS BELIEVED TO BE WHERE THE STORY BEGINS. JENNIFER BOLDUC WENT TO SARAH HAJNEY'S HOME TO HELP HER HOUSE-SIT. THEY WERE DUE TO BE IN SCHOOL FRIDAY MORNING BUT NEVER SHOWED UP. BOTH GIRLS WERE CHEERLEADERS -- WENT TO DRYDEN HIGH SCHOOL. WELL-KNOWN, GOOD FAMILIES. MY SONS KNEW WHO THEY WERE THROUGH THE SPORTS FROM DRYDEN HIGH SCHOOL. BOTH OF THE GIRLS, SARAH AND JENNIFER, WENT TO THE SAME CHURCH THAT I WENT TO. THE COMMUNITY WAS PRETTY UNNERVED. ONE OF THE GIRLS THAT WAS MISSING HAD BEEN A STUDENT OF MY WIFE'S WHEN SHE WAS IN GRADE SCHOOL. AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WAS JUST SAYING TO THEMSELVES, "THIS IS A DREAM, AND I'M GOING TO WAKE UP FROM IT, AND IT'S ALL GOING TO BE BETTER," BUT EACH DAY THAT MOVES ON, THAT HOPE FADES. I CALLED THE S. P. ITHACA STATION AND HAD THE DISPATCHER SEND OUT WHAT WE CALL A FILE ONE ON A MISSING CAR, LOST OR STOLEN. OKAY, DO YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE MISSING TWO GIRLS HERE? YES. YES, SIR, I DO. PERPETRATORS WILL COME BACK TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME, AND SO THEY -- YOU KNOW, THEY GET A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM HAVING ROAD STOPS IN THE CRIME AREA. I MEAN, IF THERE'S SOME GUY FROM TEXAS COMING THROUGH AND THERE'S NO REASON FOR HIM TO BE ON THAT ROAD, WHY IS HE THERE? YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST -- EVERYBODY WAS ON PINS AND NEEDLES. AND IT WAS LIKE, WHEN WE LISTENED TO THE NEWS, IT WAS LIKE, "IS THIS AN ORSON WELLES? IS THIS REALLY HAPPENING?" BUT IT REALLY WAS HAPPENING. WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE CHEERLEADERS WERE MISSING, I HAD A FRIEND WHO WAS A FAMILY MEMBER, AND TO NOT KNOW WHERE YOUR FAMILY MEMBER IS IS HORRIBLE. IT'S SCARY, YOU KNOW? I'M AFRAID TO LEAVE MY DOORS UNLOCKED. I'M AFRAID TO BE OUT ALONE AT NIGHT, YOU KNOW? I NEVER WAS BEFORE. SO, THE TOWN IS -- I THINK THE TOWN IS IN SHOCK. IN LOCAL NEWS, DRYDEN IS STILL ON EDGE AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF TWO GIRLS. POLICE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR ANY LEADS TO THE WHEREABOUTS AND RETURN Mother: TIFF? OF THESE TWO YOUNG GIRLS. KATIE'S HERE TO SEE YOU. KATIE. HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING? THEY SAID IT LOOKED LIKE SOMEBODY BROKE IN, MAYBE KIDNAPPED THEM. MY GOD. I DON'T KNOW. DO YOU... DO YOU THINK THIS HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOUR DAD? IS DAD OKAY? WHERE IS HE? WHAT? NO. I'M SORRY. I JUST -- YOU KNOW, I WAS SUPPOSED TO SLEEP OVER THAT NIGHT, AND I KEEP THINKING THAT MAYBE I COULD HAVE HELPED THEM OR SOMETHING. KATIE, DON'T. IF YOU HAD GONE OVER THERE, SOMETHING COULD HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU. YEAH, I GUESS. I GOT A REPORT THEY FOUND THE CAR IN CORTLAND COUNTY, WHICH IS JUST THE NEXT COUNTY OVER, AND EVIDENCE IN THE CAR INDICATED THAT IT WAS VERY BAD. EMPLOYEES AT CORTLAND LINE COMPANY SAY THEY SAW A SUSPICIOUS MAN IN THEIR PARKING LOT FRIDAY PUTTING SOMETHING IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR. WAS REPORTEDLY FOUND SMEARED WITH BLOOD. WITNESSES SAW A MAN WEARING LONG, YELLOW GLOVES NEAR THE CAR. EVIDENTLY, THEY WERE IN THE TRUNK OF THE CAR BECAUSE THE TRUNK OF THE CAR SHOWED EVIDENCE OF BLOOD, AND AT THAT POINT, WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THEY WERE STILL ALIVE OR NOT. MY HEART'S RACING RIGHT NOW EVEN THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING SO...HORRIFIC. BRILLIANT REDS AND BRIGHT YELLOWS ARE POPPING OUT ACROSS THE HILLS OF CENTRAL NEW YORK, BUT IN THE SMALL TOWN OF DRYDEN, THE COLORS SEEM SWALLOWED IN GLOOM. ALL THIS BUZZ IS GOING AROUND, AND HELICOPTERS ARE FLYING AROUND. THAT SENT A CHILL, TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS GOING ON IN OUR TOWN. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE BECAUSE WHERE IT HAPPENED WAS IN THE VILLAGE OF McLEAN... ...WHICH IS IN THE TOWN OF DRYDEN, AND WE'RE TALKING A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY -- 250, MAYBE, MOST. I HAVE CHILDREN. I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD LET MY CHILDREN OUTSIDE TO PLAY. THAT'S THE MOST FRIGHTENING PART. THE NEXT MORNING, I COME BACK TO THE HOUSE, AND I TALKED TO A COUPLE OF THE TROOPERS ON THE ROAD. - ATTENTION, ALL UNITS. - PLEASE BE ADVISED. ROADBLOCKS HAVE BEEN EXTENDED TO NORTH MAIN AND LAKE STREET. TURNER, BENSON, HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING? NOT BAD. WHERE'D YOU GET THE COFFEE? NEIGHBORS BROUGHT IT. PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE'S STOPPED OVER BY NOW. EXCEPT THAT GUY -- ANDREWS. CAUGHT HIM STARING AT US A FEW TIMES. THAT WAS VERY UNUSUAL, SO IMMEDIATELY MY HAIR WENT UP A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR. WHY WAS HE ACTING DIFFERENT THAN EVERYBODY ELSE ON THE ROAD? HOW DO YOU WANT TO HANDLE THIS? LET'S PUSH HIM A LITTLE AND SEE WHAT HE GIVES US. HELLO, SIR. CAN WE CHAT WITH YOU ABOUT SOMETHING? ABOUT WHAT? ABOUT THE GIRLS THAT WENT MISSING. OKAY. CAN WE COME IN? THIS IS ABOUT THEM GIRLS? SARAH HAJNEY AND JENNIFER BOLDUC, YES. A COUPLE OF YOU GUYS ALREADY STOPPED BY. YEAH, WE KNOW. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT SARAH? NOTHING. SHE LIVED NEXT DOOR, IS ALL. YOU GUYS HAVE ANY SUSPECTS? WE CAN'T DISCUSS THAT WITH YOU. WHAT ELSE DID YOU KNOW ABOUT HER? LIKE I SAID, I DIDN'T KNOW HER THAT WELL. I DIDN'T TALK TO HER OR NOTHING. WHAT WERE YOU DOING THE NIGHT THEY DISAPPEARED? I WAS HOME WITH MY WIFE. SHE LEFT FOR A FEW HOURS. I STAYED. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR KNUCKLE, JOHN? I...SKINNED IT WORKING ON MY TRUCK. DO YOU OWN A PAIR OF YELLOW GLOVES, MR. ANDREWS? WHAT? WORK GLOVES, LEATHER WORK GLOVES. I'M A MACHINIST. EVERYONE'S GOT WORK GLOVES. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GET OUT OF YOUR HAIR. HAVE A GOOD NIGHT. WE'LL BE IN TOUCH. THANK YOU, SIR. LOOK, LET ME CALL YOU BACK. OKAY. I'LL LOOK OUT FOR IT. THANK YOU AGAIN, SIR. THANK YOU. THAT WAS THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. AND? ANDREWS WAS DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED FROM THE ARMY, SERVED TIME. OUR ANDREWS? OUR ANDREWS. THEY HAD GOTTEN SOME INFORMATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE IN REFERENCE TO AN INCIDENT THAT HAD HAPPENED WHEN HE WAS IN THE ARMY. HE BROKE INTO A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND ATTACKED THE WIFE. AND DURING THE ATTACK, THE VICTIM WAS ABLE TO REMOVE A MASK THAT HE HAD ON, A SKI MASK, SORT OF LIKE, SO -- AND HE HAD BEEN ARRESTED. HE'S RIGHT NEXT DOOR. HE'S A NEIGHBOR. THAT'S GOING TO BE YOUR NUMBER-ONE SUSPECT AT THAT TIME. HELLO? HI. LET ME PUT YOU ON SPEAKERPHONE. HOW DO YOU LIKE THE CABIN? KATHERINE, YOU NEED TO GET UP HERE. WHAT? SOMETHING HORRIBLE HAS HAPPENED. WHAT HAPPENED? THE CABIN WAS JUST A SMALL, RUSTIC CABIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS. IT WAS A VERY REMOTE AREA. IT WAS JUST A FAMILY CABIN, AND THERE WAS A LOT OF EVIDENCE OF BLOOD ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND THERE WAS A SMALL POND OUT IN FRONT OF THEIR CABIN, AND WE WERE CALLED IN TO JUST CHECK TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY KNIVES OR ANY EVIDENCE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT IN THE POND. AND WE DID A GRID SEARCH ON THAT AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NOTHING INSIDE THE POND. FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE DEVASTATED BY THE NEWS THAT TWO CHEERLEADERS DISAPPEARED AND THEN, SOMEHOW, WERE KILLED. POLICE CONFIRMED THAT IN CORTLAND TODAY. THEY WERE FOUND DEAD THIS MORNING. MY GOD. THAT'S TERRIBLE. IT'S SUCH A SAD THING. I MEAN, ONE OF THE GIRLS, I THINK, WORKED OVER HERE, BUT I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. WELL, ONCE, OVER THE P. A. SYSTEM IN THE SCHOOL, THEY WERE TELLING ABOUT -- THEY CAME UP AND SAID THEY FOUND THE TWO BODIES OF THE GIRLS, AND EVERYONE JUST STARTED CRYING IMMEDIATELY. IT WAS TERRIBLE. AND THEN, TO KNOW THE VICTIMS, TO KNOW THE FAMILY MEMBERS -- THE PEOPLE IN DRYDEN -- 'CAUSE EVERYBODY KNEW EVERYBODY -- IT WAS JUST DEVASTATING ON THE COMMUNITY. IN DRYDEN, I WOULD THINK THAT SARAH AND JENNIFER WOULD BE THE HARDEST THING TO TALK ABOUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT OF HOW HORRIFIC IT WAS AND WHAT NICE GIRLS THEY WERE. YOU MAKE SURE YOU GET EVERY DETAIL. YOU DO EVERYTHING THAT YOU NEED TO DO TO BRING THE PERSON TO JUSTICE THAT DID THIS. MA'AM? IS THIS YOUR PROPERTY? IT'S -- IT'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR YEARS. AND WHO ELSE HAS ACCESS TO IT? MY BROTHER. AND WHAT'S YOUR BROTHER'S NAME? JOHN. JOHN ANDREWS. THEY FOUND OUT THAT THE SUSPECT HAD BEEN THERE AND KNEW ABOUT THIS CABIN. IT WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE. AT THIS POINT, I'M SURE THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT JOHN WAS INVOLVED. YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOCK THIS GUY UP AND HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT. - HANDS UP! HANDS UP! - DON'T MOVE! OFFICIALS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK SAY THEY ARE CERTAIN TWO MISSING 16-YEAR-OLD GIRLS, SARAH HAJNEY AND JENNIFER BOLDUC, HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS, WERE MURDERED. IT MAKES A CHANGE IN THE WAY THAT YOU LIVE AND THE WAY THAT YOU THINK. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT, LIKE, THE HARRIS MURDERS... OR THE CHEERLEADER MURDERS... AND YOU GO, "THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SEE ON THE NEWS," BUT THEN YOU LEARN THAT IT CAN HAPPEN HERE, IT JUST CHANGES THE WAY YOU ARE. I DON'T THINK IT'LL EVER BE THE SAME TOWN IT WAS BEFORE EVERYTHING HAPPENED. I THINK BEING THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR IN A COMMUNITY THIS SIZE, IF YOU HAVE THIS MUCH EXPOSURE TO THE BAD THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO GOOD PEOPLE, YOU EVENTUALLY ASK YOURSELF, "HOW MUCH OF THIS CAN I TAKE? WHERE IS THE BREAKING POINT?" AT DRYDEN HIGH SCHOOL, SHE AND SARAH HAJNEY ARE WELL-KNOWN JUNIORS. AFTER NEWS OF THEIR DEATHS, THE SCHOOL CANCELED CLASSES. ESPECIALLY MY TWO BOYS THAT WERE INVOLVED AND THAT WHO KNEW WHO THE GIRLS WERE JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE, LIKE, SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN. THEIR KIDS ALL WENT TO DRYDEN HIGH SCHOOL WITH THE PACE BOYS AND COACH STARR. THEY WERE ALL FROM DRYDEN HIGH SCHOOL. YOU KNOW, IT WAS ONE BIG GROUP. THEY WERE BOTH CHEERLEADERS, GREAT KIDS, GOOD GIRLS, VERY NICE. EVERYBODY'S A MESS. I KNOW OFFICERS WHO WERE ON THAT CASE, AND, YOU KNOW, GUYS WERE BREAKING DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. YOU TRY TO PUT THIS BRAVADO ON, YOU KNOW, THAT YOU'RE A TOUGH GUY. AND, YOU KNOW, HEY, WE ARE TOUGH. WE TRY TO BE. WE HAVE A JOB TO DO. BUT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOCK THIS GUY UP AND HE'S NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT. - ATTENTION, ALL UNITS. - ALL-POINTS BULLETIN. SUSPECT IS IDENTIFIED AS 31-YEAR-OLD JOHN ANDREWS. ALL UNITS PROCEED TO CHURCH STREET IN DRYDEN. - HANDS UP! HANDS UP! - DON'T MOVE! - DO NOT MOVE! - HANDS UP! - KEEP THEM UP! - DO NOT MOVE! DO NOT MOVE! AT A PRESS CONFERENCE, POLICE ANNOUNCED THE ARREST OF A SUSPECT -- A MAN WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR TO THE HAJNEY GIRL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRESS BRIEFING TODAY IS TO ANNOUNCE THAT AN ARREST HAS BEEN MADE. THE INDIVIDUAL ARRESTED IS IDENTIFIED AS JOHN BENJAMIN ANDREWS, AGE 31, OF McLEAN, NEW YORK. POLICE SAY THE SUSPECT IS NOT COOPERATING IN THE INVESTIGATION. "JOHN BENJAMIN ANDREWS JR., EX-CONVICT, LED A QUIET LIFE IN McLEAN UNTIL HIS ARREST FOR KIDNAPPING. HIS ARREST SURPRISED NEIGHBORS ON CHURCH STREET, WHERE ANDREWS HAD MOVED WITH HIS WIFE AND THEIR YOUNG SON MORE THAN A YEAR AGO". IT'S JUST STRANGE. YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHO YOU LIVE NEXT TO. I DON'T KNOW HOW A PARENT RECOVERS FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW, LOSING A CHILD BY AN ACCIDENT IS ONE THING, BUT TO LOSE A CHILD FROM SOME HEINOUS ACT LIKE THIS IS JUST... I DON'T KNOW HOW PARENTS GET THROUGH THIS. IT'S GOT TO BE DIFFICULT. MY HEART'S RACING RIGHT NOW EVEN THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING SO...HORRIFIC. MY HEART...BLEEDS FOR THOSE PARENTS. THAT'S A MOTHER'S CRY. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT? I'M SORRY. YOU GOT NOTHING TO SAY? I THINK YOU WANTED TO GET CAUGHT. WHY THE HELL ELSE YOU PICK YOUR NEIGHBORS, LEAVE THE CAR? YOU WANTED US TO FIND YOU. HE WAS JUST A MAN THAT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS... UM... ALMOST LIKE THERE WAS NO LOOK TO HIM, THAT JUST -- NO FEELINGS. BLANK -- IT LOOKED BLANK. THERE WAS JUST NOTHING THERE. YOU HEAR THAT WHEN HE GOT PUT IN JAIL, HE WAS PLAYING CARDS WITH THE INMATES. NO REMORSE. THIS GUY -- THIS GUY JUST NEEDS TO BE DONE AWAY WITH. JUST LET EVERYBODY AROUND THIS AREA HAVE AT HIM AND LET HIM DIE A TORTURED DEATH. I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S EVIL. THE PAIN, THE DARKNESS, THE HORROR -- HOW DO YOU RECOVER FROM THAT? I ACTUALLY HAD A BROTHER THAT LIVED IN McLEAN AREA, WHERE ANDREWS LIVED. THEY KNEW WHO HE WAS. THEY DIDN'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT HIM. HE HAD GROWN UP THERE. HE GRADUATED FROM DRYDEN HIGH SCHOOL. HOW DID THIS PERSON LIVE AMONG US AND WE NOT KNOW? HOW CAN SOMEBODY FROM OUR COMMUNITY BE LIKE THAT? HE LIVED DIRECTLY NEXT DOOR, PROBABLY WITHIN 50 FEET. THEIR HOUSES WERE THAT CLOSE. FROM HIS HOUSE, YOU COULD LOOK DOWN INTO HER HOUSE WINDOWS. AND SO HE KNEW THAT THE PARENTS WEREN'T HOME, KNEW THAT THE GIRLS WERE THERE ALONE. I DON'T THINK HE WAS AWARE THERE WAS A SECOND GIRL THERE, AND I THINK THINGS JUST GOT OUT OF HAND, AND THEN -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WENT ON IN HIS MIND THAT HE DID WHAT HE DID. I'M SURE THE GIRL THAT WAS IN THE SHOWER GAVE HIM A FIGHT. OTHERWISE, THAT SOAP DISH WOULDN'T HAVE GOT BROKE AND THE SHOWER CURTAIN SMASHED. I'M SURE THAT SHE PUT UP A HECK OF A FIGHT, AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS AT WHAT POINT THE GIRLS DIED. AND I REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW. YOU NEVER GET TO SEE THEM COMBING THEIR HAIR. YOU NEVER GET TO SEE THEM DRESSED IN THEIR CHEERLEADING UNIFORM. YOU DON'T GET TO SEE THEM GOING OFF TO THE PROM. AS THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR INVOLVED IN IT, IT WAS QUITE A SENSATION TO SEE THE PEOPLE FILE INTO THE GYMNASIUM AND SEE THE SEATS QUIETLY FILL UP. I ESPECIALLY REMEMBER -- I'M SUPPOSED TO BE STRONG. AND IT REALLY BECAME SO REAL WHEN SCHOOL BUSES FROM OTHER SCHOOLS SHOWED UP... ...AND THEIR CHEERLEADERS SHOWED UP IN A CAMARADERIE. I HAVE, UNDER MY BLOTTER, THE PRAYER CARD FROM SARAH AND JEN'S SERVICE, AND I ESPECIALLY LIKE THIS ONE. I'VE TAKEN IT OUT TO SHOW IT TO YOU NOW, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN OUT OF THERE IN 20 YEARS. BUT I'LL READ IT. "DO NOT STAND AT MY GRAVE AND WEEP. I AM NOT THERE. I DO NOT SLEEP. I AM A THOUSAND WINDS THAT BLOW. I AM THE DIAMOND'S GLINT ON SNOW. DO NOT STAND AT MY GRAVE AND CRY. I AM NOT THERE. I DID NOT DIE". AT ABOUT 1:15, 1:30 IN THE MORNING, I GOT A CALL FROM THE JAIL. I WENT IN TO WHERE HE WAS -- HIS CELL. JOHN ANDREWS HAD HUNG HIMSELF IN THE JAIL. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS, "JUSTICE," YOU KNOW, "GOT WHAT HE DESERVED". I WAS ACTUALLY THE LEAD INVESTIGATOR ON HIS SUICIDE. HE WASN'T ON A SUICIDE WATCH OR ANYTHING. HE HADN'T THREATENED SUICIDE. WE DID FIND SOME LETTERS IN HIS CELL THAT HE WANTED TO SEND. THERE WAS NOTHING IN THE NOTES OF THE CRIME AT ALL, ABOUT WHAT HE HAD DONE OR WHY HE HAD DONE IT. IT JUST SAID HE WAS SORRY FOR WHAT WAS GOING ON -- AGAIN, FROM WHAT I CAN REMEMBER -- SORRY THAT HE PUT HIS FAMILY THROUGH THIS. IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE THAT SAVED THE COMMUNITY SO MUCH PAIN AND ANGUISH -- GOING THROUGH THAT, GOING THROUGH A TRIAL LIKE THAT. WE HAD GONE OUT TO HIS WIFE'S PARENTS' HOUSE, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE SHE WAS STAYING WITH HER SON, TO MAKE THE NOTIFICATION. I KNOCKED ON THE DOOR. HER FATHER ANSWERED THE DOOR. I DIDN'T TELL HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED, JUST THAT WE NEEDED TO SEE HER. SAT HER DOWN, TOLD HER WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO JOHN ANDREWS. SHE STARTED TO CRY, AND THE FATHER SAID, "GOOD. I'M GLAD IT HAPPENED". IF NORMAN ROCKWELL HAD PAINTED DRYDEN, IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE TALKED OVER THE BACK FENCE TO EACH OTHER, A TOWN WHERE EVERYONE KNEW AND TRUSTED THEIR NEIGHBOR. OUR LITTLE TOWNS ARE PREDICTABLE. AND THEN WHEN THE UNPREDICTABLE COMES UP, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO TO TRUST. HER DEATH WAS UNEXPECTED. NONE OF IT MAKES SENSE. IT WAS STARTLING, WHAT THE VILLAGE OF DRYDEN HAD GONE THROUGH -- FROM THE HARRIS MURDERS TO THE MURDER OF THEIR FOOTBALL COACH TO THE MURDER OF THE COWORKER AT THE AUTO DEALERSHIP TO THE CHEERLEADERS FROM McLEAN. WHEN IS THIS GOING TO STOP? WHY IS THIS HAPPENING? ONE OF THE WORST THINGS WAS THAT THEY STARTED PUTTING IT IN THE PAPER AND TALKING ABOUT IT, CALLING DRYDEN "THE VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED". AND THE LOCAL PEOPLE, THAT REALLY UPSET THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE NICE PEOPLE, HARDWORKING PEOPLE. ARE PEOPLE FEELING A LITTLE CURSED, AT THIS POINT, BY THE STRING OF EVENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS? I CAN'T SAY CURSED, NO. AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THOSE PEOPLE HAVE NEVER LIVED AND WORKED HERE. THEY'VE NEVER GONE TO SCHOOL HERE. THEY'VE NEVER RAISED THEIR FAMILY HERE. IF YOU GOOGLE "DRYDEN", YOU SEE COMMENTS, LIKE, THAT IT'S "THE VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED", AND IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE. AND IT JUST SO HAPPENS THAT, FOR A RELATIVELY BRIEF PERIOD IN ITS HISTORY, A LOT OF BAD THINGS HAPPENED. I FEEL HONORED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT KATIE. THAT'S AN HONOR FOR ME. LIKE A DYNAMO, JUST... HER POSITIVE ENERGY WOULD JUST FILL A ROOM. SHE NEVER WOULD LEAVE WITHOUT A HUG GOODBYE OR AN "I LOVE YOU". IT'S KATIE. AND... ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S THE LOOK. THAT. I MEAN, LIKE A MEGAWATT, THAT SMILE AND JOYFUL EXUBERANCE. THAT'S BEAUTIFUL. THAT'S AWESOME. KATIE WAS KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT, I THINK ON A FRIDAY MORNING. HER DEATH WAS UNEXPECTED. SHE'D GRADUATED AND GONE ON TO COLLEGE AND WAS BACK. BUT, YEAH, IT WAS UNEXPECTED. I THINK THERE WERE OVER 1,000 PEOPLE AT HER MEMORIAL. SHE TOUCHED A LOT OF LIVES IN A VERY SHORT TIME. WHEN I VISIT THE CEMETERY, I USUALLY JUST SIT QUIETLY. I FEEL AT PEACE. SOMETIMES IT'S JUST CHECKING IN, YOU KNOW? A LOT OF YEARS HAVE PASSED, AND SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FEELING LIKE I SHOULD CHECK IN AND CATCH EVERYBODY UP. EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE, IN THE SUMMERTIME, I'LL TAKE A RIDE UP THERE AND JUST STOP AND SAY A LITTLE QUICK PRAYER FOR THE GIRLS. AND, HOPEFULLY, THEY'RE ALL TOGETHER RIGHT NOW. THEY MIGHT BE UP THERE WATCHING US RIGHT NOW. I DON'T KNOW. PEOPLE KEPT TALKING ABOUT HOW, "I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW STRONG YOU ARE AND HOW YOU'RE GETTING THROUGH ALL THIS. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT". WELL, THE TRUTH WAS, I WASN'T STRONG, YOU KNOW? AND THE TRUTH WAS, I HAD ALWAYS BEEN PUTTING UP A GREAT FRONT OF BEING STRONG, WHILE INSIDE, THERE WAS SO MUCH PAIN. I WAS JUST, YOU KNOW, VISITING A CHURCH AT THE TIME, AND THE WOMEN'S MINISTRY LEADER WAS THE ONE GIVING THE MESSAGE, AND HER FOCUS WAS ON THE POWER OF PRAYER, AND THAT'S WHEN THAT WEIGHT LIFTED. IT WAS SUCH A CHANGE FOR ME, AND I BURST INTO TEARS, AND EVERYBODY'S RUNNING OVER TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG. AND, YOU KNOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY, MANY YEARS, SOMETHING WAS RIGHT AGAIN. BUT TO FORGIVE IS WHAT UNBURDENS YOU. I HAVE LEARNED HOW TO FORGIVE MICHAEL KINGE. FOR YEARS, EVERY TIME I WAS HEADED TO WORK, I WOULD DRIVE BY THE HOUSE, AND AS I DROVE BY THE HOUSE, I'D JUST SAY A LITTLE PRAYER. MAY I ASK YOU WHAT THAT PRAYER WAS? JUST, YOU KNOW, THAT THEY DIDN'T SUFFER TOO MUCH. IF YOU WERE TO BE DROPPED OUT OF THE SKY AND HAD TO LAND IN A PLACE, I'D HOPE YOU'LL LAND IN A PLACE LIKE DRYDEN. EVIL'S NOT GOING TO WIN IN THE TOWN OF DRYDEN. IT CAN'T, BECAUSE WHEN GOD SHINES HIS LIGHT, DARKNESS CAN NEVER STAY DARK. IT WAS A HARD TIME. THERE'S NO QUESTION. BUT IF YOU TALLY UP ALL THE LOVE THAT STILL IS HELD WITHIN PEOPLE'S HEARTS IN THIS COMMUNITY, YOU WOULD FIND THAT THE LOVE, SO FAR, SO GREATLY OUTWEIGHED THE NEGATIVE. I'M PROUD OF OUR COMMUNITY. WE ARE... WE ARE GOOD PEOPLE. WE'RE REALLY GOOD PEOPLE. IT WAS JUST A BUNCH OF GOOD PEOPLE THAT HAD SOME BAD LUCK FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND, HOPEFULLY, IT'S OVER.
