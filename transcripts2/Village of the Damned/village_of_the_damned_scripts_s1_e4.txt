 PREVIOUSLY ON "VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED"... OUR JUNIOR YEAR, SHARI BEGAN DATING J. P. MERCHANT. I REMEMBER J. P. JUST BEING VERY...JUST VERY QUIET. I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL WHILE I WAS BABYSITTING... ...TO TELL ME THAT SHARI HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE. LOOK, J. P. -- YOU KNOW HE DATED SHARI FITTS IN HIGH SCHOOL? SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE WHILE THEY WERE DATING. LISTEN, IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY... ...JUST BE CAREFUL. HELLO? NO ONE IS GOING TO STOP ME FROM BEING WITH YOU.

 J.P., I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU ANYMORE. "HE HID HIS OBSESSION UNTIL THE LAST DAY." I FEEL THERE WAS SOME TYPE OF DARKNESS HE WAS TRYING TO HIDE OR PUSH BACK, YOU KNOW, AND IT KEPT CREEPING FORWARD. GET UP. AMBER, RUN. HELP! NEIL! NEIL! WHERE'S AMBER? I DON'T KNOW! I DON'T KNOW! NEIL! THERE SHE IS! THERE SHE IS! HURRY! GET INSIDE!

 WHAT'S HAPPENED?! STEVE, HE'S CALLED THE COPS! HE SHOT HIM. WHAT? J.P. SHOT HIM. WILL, GO GET THE SHOTGUN RIGHT NOW. WHAT? THAT KID, HE JUST SHOT STEVE! WHAT?! HELLO. I NEED TO REPORT A CRIME... IS DAD OKAY? WHERE IS HE? I KNEW STEVE. WE WERE DEFINITELY FRIENDS. STEVE WOULD JUST TELL ME THAT THEY WERE HAVING A PROBLEM WITH THE BOYFRIEND OF HIS DAUGHTER, AND HE KNEW THAT, OBVIOUSLY, I WAS A DEPUTY SHERIFF. SO HE WOULD TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF THAT. LET'S GO! G- O! GO, DRYDEN! G- O! LET'S GO! IS THAT J. P.? YEAH. HE DEFINITELY TOOK IT SERIOUSLY. HIS FIRST AND FOREMOST PRIORITY WAS TO PROTECT HIS FAMILY. I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT HE MAY NOT HAVE BELIEVED THAT IT COULD HAVE ACTUALLY HAPPENED. GOT A CALL CAME IN THAT SAID THAT JONATHAN WAS AT THE HOUSE. THERE WERE SHOTS FIRED. AND I JUST REMEMBER DRIVING THE FASTEST I'VE EVER DRIVEN TO GET TO THAT HOUSE. JONATHAN HAD LEFT IN THE CAR. THERE'S A STRONG, STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT JONATHAN MIGHT TRY TO RETURN TO THE SCENE. WE KNEW THAT HE WAS ARMED, SO YOU ALSO HAVE TO MAINTAIN VIGILANCE. WE RECEIVED INFORMATION THAT A MALE HAD BEEN SHOT. WE SUSPECTED THAT IT WAS, IN FACT, STEVE. YOU JUST HOPED THAT, EVEN THOUGH THEY SAID THERE WERE SHOTS FIRED THAT... AT THE MOST, MAYBE SOMEBODY JUST GOT INJURED. THE INVESTIGATOR INVITED ME IN THE HOUSE. WE WENT INSIDE. HE SHOWED ME THE CRIME SCENE. THEN HE SHOWED ME STEVE'S BODY. AND YOU COULD PIECE TOGETHER PRETTY EASILY WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THE FIRST SHOT HAD HIT HIM IN THE RIB CAGE, AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THAT DIDN'T KILL HIM, AND THEN THERE WAS A SECOND SHOT THAT HAD HIT HIM IN THE FOREHEAD. HE STOOD IN THE WAY AS A BARRIER TO PROTECT HIS DAUGHTER. IT'S ABSOLUTELY CLEAR TO ME THAT HE DIED PROTECTING HIS FAMILY -- PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST COURAGEOUS THINGS ANYBODY COULD DO. THAT PROBABLY SUMS UP STEVE IN ITS ENTIRETY. HE'S ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD, DOING WHAT HE LOVES. I DON'T THINK HE WAS EVER HAPPIER DOING HIS COACHING, TEACHING KIDS, BEING AROUND HIS FAMILY AND HIS DAUGHTERS AND WIFE. IT DEFINITELY STIRS SOME EMOTIONS TO SEE THAT PICTURE. A COMMUNITY'S HOPES ARE SHATTERED, AND A KILLER IS ON THE LOOSE. I MEAN, EVERYWHERE YOU GO IN TOWN, PEOPLE ARE STILL IN A DAZE ABOUT THE WHOLE THING. JUST -- IT'S JUST UNBELIEVABLE THAT THIS HAS HAPPENED IN OUR LITTLE TOWN. WHEN STEVE DIED, I REMEMBER WONDERING, "HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN? IS THIS A PATTERN? IS THIS A TREND?" AND IT CAME ACROSS FROM THE NEWS THAT "DRYDEN COACH GUNNED DOWN," YOU KNOW, AND AGAIN, YOUR MOUTH DROPS OPEN AND YOU'RE JUST KIND OF LIKE, "WHAT? HOW?" LIKE YOU'RE IN -- LIKE THE TOWN WAS IN A BUBBLE AND ALL THE HURT WAS JUST ON DRYDEN. NOW YOU'RE LOCKING THE DOOR. NOW YOU'RE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE YOUR KIDS ARE. I THINK EVERYBODY IN THAT AREA WAS SCARED AND CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON, AND THERE'S REALLY SOMEBODY BAD OUT THERE. AFTER JONATHAN HAD LEFT THE HOUSE... ...WE WERE STILL ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR HIM, BUT THERE'S DEFINITELY MULTIPLE OFFICERS AND AGENCIES INVOLVED IN KEEPING A LOOKOUT FOR HIM AND THE VEHICLE. THAT IS A VERY GOOD POSSIBILITY THAT DEADLY FORCE NEEDED TO BE USED. I REMEMBER RECEIVING A RADIO TRANSMISSION THAT JONATHAN'S VEHICLE AND HIM WERE LOCATED AT THE CEMETERY IN HOMER, AND HE HAD KILLED HIMSELF WITH A SELF-INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUND. IN A SITUATION WHERE THE SUSPECT IS NEVER ABLE TO BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE, THERE'S NUMEROUS QUESTIONS THAT YOU'LL NEVER ANSWER. WE CAN ONLY SPECULATE AS TO WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN THINKING, WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN FEELING. A GUT FEELING HAS ALWAYS TOLD ME THERE IS MORE TO THE STORY THAN WHAT TRULY WAS EVER SHARED WITH US. PART OF ME THOUGHT WHEN I HEARD ABOUT J. P. -- IT MADE ME WONDER... IF THERE WAS MORE TO THE QUIETNESS THAT DAY. DID HE MEET HER AT HOME? WAS HE THERE WHEN SHE GOT HOME AND MAYBE AN ARGUMENT HAPPENED? YOU KNOW? IT'S BEEN ALMOST 26 YEARS, AND I STILL ASK THOSE QUESTIONS. I REALLY... REALLY WOULDN'T LIKE TO -- I DON'T WANT TO ANSWER THAT. THERE WAS SO MUCH DEVASTATION IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. IT'S, LIKE, YOU'D WAKE UP AND, "WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY?" I SAW THE WORK OF EVIL. IT'S A HORROR SCENE. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO DESCRIBE IT. IT'S BEEN, LIKE, 22 YEARS. THE COLOR'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE SAME. GO BACK TO THE SCENE, SOME MEMORIES ARE ALWAYS BOUND TO POP UP. I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD. THIS WAS MY VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH A DEATH THAT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING PURPOSELY CAUSED. I KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAY STEVE DIED A HERO, AND I'M NOT DIMINISHING THAT. HE DIED A DAD AND DOING WHAT A DAD WOULD DO. THE IMPACT OF HIS LOSS ON THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, IT WAS DEEP AND IT WAS KIND OF RIPPLING. I HAD THIS DONE A FEW YEARS AGO. COACH STARR IS THE STAR LOOKING DOWN. I LOVE THIS. THERE'S SO MANY UNSAID CONVERSATIONS. I WOULD HAVE WANTED HIM TO BE AT MY WEDDING, BE AT MY MOM'S FUNERAL. I'M PASSING ON THE THINGS THAT HE TAUGHT ME TO THE KIDS THAT I COACH TODAY. THAT'S HOW HIS LEGACY LIVES. OFTENTIMES, BEFORE YOU BRING AN ATHLETIC TEAM OUT ON THE FIELD OF COMPETITION, EVERYONE COMES IN AS A CIRCLE FACING EACH OTHER, AND EVERYONE'S HANDS ARE IN THE MIDDLE, TOUCHING. THE CHEER THAT I REMEMBER -- THE PHRASE IS "WE ARE ONE". "WE ARE ONE," AND IT'S THAT MIND-SET THAT WE'RE A FAMILY, AND NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, GOOD OR BAD, WE'RE EACH OTHER'S BROTHERS, WE'RE EACH OTHER'S FAMILY. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP! COACH STARR WAS LIKE A FATHER TO ME, AND I KNOW HE WAS TO YOU. BUT WE CAN EITHER GO OUT TODAY AND WE CAN HANG OUR HEADS OR WE CAN STAND TALL. WE ARE A FAMILY. WE ARE ONE! WHAT ARE WE? ONE. - WHAT ARE WE?! - ONE! - WHAT ARE WE?! - ONE! ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT! LET'S GO GET THEM! COME ON! LET'S DO IT! WE HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS. WE PROTECT EACH OTHER. WE'RE ONE. THERE WAS SO MUCH DEVASTATION IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. YOU'D WAKE UP AND, "WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TODAY?" AND THE SAME GROUP OF PEOPLE WERE AFFECTED OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. MOST OF THESE TRAGEDIES ALL REVOLVED AROUND OUR HIGH SCHOOL. OUR COMMUNITY WAS FACED, ONCE AGAIN, AFTER STEVE'S DEATH, WITH A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT, WHERE A FAMILY LOST ONE OF THEIR SONS. AND THEN THE SAME FAMILY LOST ANOTHER SON, WHICH WAS JUST SOMETHING THAT WAS SO, SO UNUSUAL. I KNEW THEY BOTH WERE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYERS, AND THEN THEY WERE PRETTY CLOSE BROTHERS. IN THE CASE OF THE PACE BROTHERS, THEY BOTH DIED IN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENTS, AND NOT VERY FAR APART IN THE TIME SPAN, HARDLY GIVING THEIR FAMILY TIME TO HEAL FROM ONE LOSS BEFORE THEY HAD THE SECOND LOSS. THE RESPONSE FROM THE COMMUNITY WAS THE SAME AS IF IT HAD BEEN A CRIMINAL DEATH. ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS DYING IN A CAR ACCIDENT A YEAR AFTER HIS BROTHER DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT. WHEN THOSE DEATHS HAPPENED TO THOSE TWO YOUNG MAN, NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, A HANDFUL OF JUST TRAGIC, TRAGIC INCIDENTS THAT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED, AND TO HAVE THEM ALL LOCATED IN THE SAME TOWN, THAT PUTS A LOT OF FEAR AND APPREHENSION IN YOUR HEAD. DRYDEN'S A VERY LITTLE TOWN. YOU KNOW, YOU DRIVE THROUGH IT, YOU BLINK, IT'S OVER. DRYDEN WAS SUCH A SMALL COMMUNITY, AND THEY WEREN'T USED TO IT. NOT FOR SMALL COMMUNITIES -- YOU DON'T SEE THAT KIND OF, YOU KNOW, DEVASTATION. AND FOR DRYDEN, IT JUST, LIKE, WAS THEIR DARK PERIOD. I SHOULD HAVE... I SHOULD HAVE MOVED A LONG TIME BEFORE I DID. I STAYED IN DRYDEN TOO LONG. WELL, I MET ED -- GOODNESS -- A LONG TIME AGO. WE WORKED TOGETHER. WE WERE JUST FRIENDS -- JUST FRIENDS, AND FRIENDS BECAME MORE. HE WAS JUST CRAZY. HE WAS FUN AND JUST, YOU KNOW, FULL OF LIFE. I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER WHEN THIS PICTURE WAS TAKEN. IT'S JUST ALL FIVE OF US. EVERYBODY'S HAPPY. HE WASN'T FULL OF LIFE. YOU KNOW, YOU COULD JUST SEE... THE DULLNESS, LIKE, COVERING HIM. HIS EYES AREN'T AS SHINY. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE DARKER. IT WAS WHEN THINGS STARTED TO GO BAD. YEAH. HE WAS IN THE NATIONAL GUARD, AND HE TOLD ME THAT IF HE WAS EVER OFF WITH THE GUARD ON A MISSION THAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIM, I WAS NOT TO BELIEVE THE STORY THAT THEY SAID -- THAT HE WAS BASICALLY SAYING THAT THE GUARD WAS OUT TO KILL HIM. HE TOLD ME THAT I HAD TO GET RID OF THE YELLOW KITCHEN CURTAINS... ...THAT YELLOW WAS A SIGN OF EVIL. I WAS LIKE, "ED, GET OUT OF HERE." YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE, "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?" I GOT RID OF THE CURTAINS. HE SAID THAT THE TV WAS GIVING HIM SUBLIMINAL MESSAGES. I'M LIKE, "I DON'T SEE ANYTHING". YOU KNOW, HE'S LIKE, "YOU DON'T SEE THAT?" I'M LIKE, "NO". HE NEVER REALLY DID TELL ME WHAT THEY SAID. AND YOU TRY TO ACT LIKE IT'S NORMAL, BUT IT'S NOT. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT. YOU DON'T KNOW IF HE'S JOKING. HE WOULD SAY THAT THE BLACK CROWS, THAT THEY WERE WATCHING HIM. YOU SEE BLACK CROWS ALL THE TIME, BUT HE THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE ALL AROUND, THAT THEY WERE FOLLOWING HIM. HE KNEW THAT SOMETHING BAD WAS GONNA HAPPEN. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT. HE LOCKED ME IN A CAR... ...AND WOULDN'T LET ME OUT THE CAR. TOOK OFF IN THE CAR. ED, PLEASE STOP! ED, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS! YOU'RE GOING TO KILL US! ED, PLEASE! HE SAID THAT WE WERE GOING TO DIE. YOU CAN BE MARRIED FOR A THOUSAND YEARS, KNOW A PERSON, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. SOME DAYS WERE JUST HORRIBLE. I MEAN, HE LOCKED ME IN A CAR ONCE... ...AND WOULDN'T LET ME OUT THE CAR. HE SAYS, "WELL, WE'RE GOING TO DIE". ED, PLEASE STOP! ED, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS! YOU'RE GOING TO KILL US! ED, PLEASE! AND JUST DROVE THE CAR AS FAST AS HE COULD GET THE CAR TO GO. AND I'M SCREAMING AT HIM AND I'M CRYING. YOU KEEP TALKING. YOU TRY TO APOLOGIZE. PLEASE, PLEASE STOP! JUST... "I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY." YOU KNOW? YOU JUST -- YOU KIND OF BEG FOR YOUR LIFE. VERY TERRIFYING. SORRY. HE DECIDED TO DO THE PSYCHIATRIC CENTER WITH A LOT OF PRODDING FROM ME, BECAUSE IT'S LIKE, "LOOK, WE HAVE THREE BOYS," AND HE FINALLY AGREED. YOU'RE THINKING, "IT'S GOING TO BE A WHILE. LET'S GET HIM BETTER." IT DON'T TAKE A WEEK OR TWO TO GET BETTER. AND HE JUST SHOWS UP. HEY! ED? HEY! I'M BACK! I THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE YOU. AND I'M LIKE, "HOW'D YOU GET OUT?" AND HE'S LIKE, "WELL, THE DOCTOR SAYS THERE'S NOTHING WRONG." AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, "IDIOT". WHERE ARE THE BOYS? THEY'RE IN THE BACKYARD. HONEY? ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU SHOULD -- HOW ABOUT A "WELCOME HOME, ED"? I'M SORRY. I'M SO-- BOYS! HEY! ED WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT HE COULD FOOL ANYBODY, AND SO THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE HE HAD A PROBLEM. THE BOYS AND ED AND I WERE PICNICKING, AND HIS FAMILY WAS PICNICKING, AND WE JUST HIT IT OFF. ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE HOT DOGS, CHIPS, BEERS. BOB'S PERSONALITY WAS -- HE WAS A FAMILY MAN. HE HAD TWO GIRLS -- TWO LITTLE GIRLS. HE WAS NICE TO HANG OUT WITH. THEY DID EVENTUALLY WORK TOGETHER. BOB HELPED ED GET THE JOB AT STAFFORD CHEVROLET ON ROUTE 13 IN DRYDEN. ED LOVED HIS NEW JOB AT STAFFORD'S. HE FINALLY HAD SOMETHING HE ENJOYED DOING, AND I THOUGHT... THINGS WERE GOING TO BE BETTER. THAT'S WHY...I LET HIM... BUY A GUN. HE WANTED TO GO HUNTING. HE LOVED THE OUTDOORS. HE LOVED TO FISH. I'M LIKE, "OKAY. MAYBE THINGS WILL BE BETTER." HE BOUGHT THE GUN FROM BOB. I SAYS, "THERE'S RULES. IT'S GOT TO BE LOCKED UP. IT'S GOT TO BE AWAY FROM THE KIDS." YOU KNOW, "I DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW WHERE IT IS." SO, I GAVE IN. THE SHOT RANG OUT AT MIDMORNING AT THE STAFFORD CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP ON ROUTE 13 IN DRYDEN. AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS REAL. I JUST -- I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. HE DID GET HAPPIER FOR A WHILE. AND I THOUGHT THINGS WERE GOING TO BE BETTER. HIM FINALLY GETTING A JOB, AT STAFFORD'S -- I STARTED TO FEEL, "OKAY, MAYBE WE CAN DO THIS." YOU KNOW, "WE CAN MAKE IT WORK." BOB WAS HIS BOSS, BUT ED WASN'T THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT YOU COULD BOSS AROUND. ED. ED. ED! HEY, BOB. I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I NEED YOU ON THE FLOOR. JUST TAKING A SMOKE BREAK. JUST 10 MINUTES. PUT IT OUT. GET BACK ON THE FLOOR -- NOW. THAT FRIDAY BEFOREHAND, HE HAD YELLED AT ED, AND I GUESS ED HAD HARBORED IT ALL WEEKEND -- ALL WEEKEND. THE DAY, SEPTEMBER 24th, ED AND I HAD GOTTEN UP. HE WAS GETTING READY FOR WORK. I GOT READY FOR WORK, GOT THE KIDS OFF TO SCHOOL. THE MORNING WAS NORMAL. MAYBE AN HOUR OR SO AFTER I HAD BEEN AT WORK, MY BOSS HAD COME UP TO ME AND TOLD ME THAT HE THINKS ED WAS ON THE PHONE FOR ME. AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU THINK?" YOU KNOW, HE KNEW ED. SO I WENT TO THE PHONE, AND, LIKE, ED'S LIKE, "DONNA," AND HE'S WHISPERING. HE GOES, "I SHOT BOB." I'M LIKE, "WHAT?" HE GOES, "I SHOT BOB". AND YOUR INSIDES JUST TURN. I ASKED HIM, "WHERE ARE YOU?" AND HE GOES, "I'M AT WORK." I'M LIKE, "OKAY." SO, I TOLD MY BOSS. I SAYS, "I GOT TO GO." AND WHEN I WALKED INTO OUR BEDROOM... ...THE LOCK OF THE GUN WAS ON OUR BED. THE SHOT RANG OUT AT MIDMORNING AT THE STAFFORD CHEVROLET DEALERSHIP ON ROUTE 13 IN DRYDEN --  ONE WORKER, WE'RE TOLD, FIRING AT ANOTHER. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, ED GOT TO WORK AND BOB STARTING YELLING AT HIM, AND ED HAD ALL THOSE FEELINGS THAT HE DIDN'T LET GO. SO I GUESS WHAT HAPPENED WAS, ED GOT BACK IN OUR CAR -- OR HIS CAR -- DROVE HOME. HE JUST, I GUESS... HE JUST SNAPPED. DROVE BACK TO STAFFORD'S AND WALKED UP TO BOB AND SHOT HIM. AND I GUESS THEY HAD ALREADY TAKEN ED TO THE POLICE STATION. I THINK I ASKED, "WELL, HOW'S BOB?" AND THEY SAID HE HAD DIED. I JUST -- I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. THE FAMILY THAT IT HAPPENED TO, IT'S GOING TO BE WITH THEM. THEY LOST A PERSON. THE KIDS -- WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE A FATHER, AND... IT CHANGED OUR WHOLE LIFE. I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING WAS WRONG WITH HIM PRIOR TO MY MOM PULLING US OUT OF SCHOOL AND TELLING US THAT HE'S SHOT SOMEONE. AND ALL I COULD DO WAS CRY. "WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO MY FATHER? WILL I EVER SEE HIM AGAIN?" I'M ALONE NOW WITH THREE YOUNG BOYS. THEY -- SORRY. GROWING UP IN DRYDEN RIGHT AFTER THAT WAS VERY HARD BECAUSE EVERYBODY IN DRYDEN KNEW OUR FAMILY. WE'D GO EVERYWHERE AND ANYWHERE, AND EVERYBODY KNEW WHO WE WERE. I STAYED IN DRYDEN TOO LONG. I STAYED SEVEN, EIGHT YEARS. I LEFT MY KIDS IN A COMMUNITY THAT KNEW AND JUDGED THEM FOR WHAT THEIR FATHER DID, BUT IT'S HARD TO PACK UP AND MOVE. WHAT I HEARD TODAY FROM MY MOM REALLY SHOCKED ME. I REALIZE HOW MUCH SHE DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT HIM TO PROTECT US. I THINK SHE DID PROTECT US AND SHIELD US FROM A LOT OF THINGS, HOPE THAT WE DIDN'T TURN DOWN THE SAME PATH THAT HE DID. I FEEL LIKE... UM... SOMETIMES I RUINED THEIR LIFE. HE DID. HE RUINED OUR LIVES MORE THAN ANYTHING. I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING THAT SHE COULD HAVE DID. 'CAUSE SHE'S THE MOST WONDERFUL PERSON IN THE WORLD. HAVE OUR "TRUMAN SHOW" MOMENT. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU TOO, MAMA. I GOT YA. PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU, "WELL, YOU'VE GOT TO GO ON." BUT HOW? ALL THIS BUZZ IS GOING AROUND, AND HELICOPTERS ARE FLYING AROUND, AND SO YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, "WHAT'S GOING ON?" - THE 16-YEAR-OLD GIRLS WERE IN - THE HOUSE -- SARAH'S HOUSE --  WHEN THEY WERE APPARENTLY ABDUCTED LAST FRIDAY MORNING. WHY DRYDEN? IF THIS IS TRUE, WHY DRYDEN AGAIN? THAT FALL WAS VERY DIFFICULT IN DRYDEN BECAUSE ONE OF THE PACE BOYS DIED THEN. MR. BERGMAN DIED. AND THEN WE HAD A HORRIBLE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED IN OUR COMMUNITY WHERE TWO OF OUR CHEERLEADERS WERE MISSING. I THINK -- DO YOU GUYS WANT TO GO OUT TO EAT? YEAH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA. I COULD GO FOR A BURGER. HEY, WHY AREN'T YOU DRESSED? THE GAME STARTS IN AN HOUR. HAVE YOU SEEN SARAH AND JEN? NO. I THOUGHT YOU THREE WERE TOGETHER. WHY? NOBODY'S SEEN THEM. SARAH WASN'T IN MY BIOLOGY, AND JEN WASN'T IN PRECALC. I TRIED CALLING SARAH'S, AND NOBODY PICKED UP. HEY, GUYS? HAS ANYONE SEEN SARAH OR JEN TODAY? THAT'S WEIRD. THERE WAS THIS HUGE BUZZ GOING AROUND THE TOWN, AND, YOU KNOW, WE HEAR THE STORY THAT THERE'S TWO GIRLS MISSING. THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP TO THE FRIDAY NIGHT GAME. FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, YOU KNOW? THAT'S A BIG THING IN HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL. FOR A CHEERLEADER OR FOOTBALL PLAYER TO NOT SHOW UP TO A GAME, YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA RAISE SOME FLAGS. IT'S GONNA SEND SOME ALARMING THINGS OUT. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO START LOOKING. IT WAS FRIDAY EVENING WHEN I GOT A CALL FROM MY SUPERIOR. HE REQUESTED THAT I GO OVER TO A RESIDENCE AND CHECK IN TO WHY TWO 16-YEAR-OLD DRYDEN HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR A FOOTBALL GAME. BILL, THANK GOD! WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? WELL, A POSSIBLE SCENARIO WAS THAT THEY WERE OUT PARTYING OR SOMETHING, BUT THESE GIRLS DIDN'T FIT THAT DESCRIPTION. I MEAN, WE TRIED CALLING AROUND. NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY ARE! I KNOW. I KNOW. CALM DOWN. I'M SURE THERE'S A PERFECTLY GOOD REASON WHY THEY WEREN'T THERE. THERE WAS SOME RELATIVES AND NEIGHBORS AT THE HOUSE WONDERING WHERE THE GIRLS WERE AND WAITING TO SEE IF THEY CAME HOME. WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY, THEN? IT'S GAME NIGHT. THESE GIRLS DON'T MISS GAMES. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE. WE ALREADY TRIED KNOCKING. OKAY. I'M SURE THEY'RE FINE, GUYS. ALL RIGHT? DON'T WORRY. HELLO! SO THE FIRST THING I DID WAS CHECK THE RESIDENCE AND THE GROUNDS, LOOKING FOR ANY POSSIBLE IDEAS WHY THEY WEREN'T AROUND. I FOUND SOME DAMAGE IN THE BATHROOM WHERE IT LOOKED LIKE THE SHOWER CURTAIN HAD BEEN TORN DOWN AND THE SOAP DISH BROKE OFF. WHAT IS IT? WHAT HAPPENED? YOU WANT TO GIVE US SOME ANSWERS?! BILL, IS SHE OKAY? JOYCE, I'M ON CHURCH ROAD IN DRYDEN. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET AN INVESTIGATOR DOWN HERE. LOOKS LIKE A BREAKING AND ENTERING, POSSIBLE ABDUCTION. AT THAT POINT, WE KNEW THERE HAD BEEN FOUL PLAY AND SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO THE GIRLS. THIS IS THE HAMLET OF McLEAN, WHERE THE TWO GIRLS WERE LAST SEEN. OKAY, DO YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE MISSING TWO GIRLS HERE? YES. I SAW IT ON THE NEWS. OKAY. YOU'VE SEEN THE PICTURES? YES. IF YOU SEE THEM OR HEAR ANYTHING, PLEASE GIVE US A CALL AT THE CORTLAND BARRACKS. I REMEMBER THE GIRLS WENT MISSING, BUT THERE WAS NO DETAILS OF WHAT WAS GOING ON. SO, THERE WERE HELICOPTERS ALL OVER, THERE WAS STATE TROOPERS, POLICE OFFICERS ALL OVER THE COMMUNITY. I WAS -- I WAS SCARED. IF NORMAN ROCKWELL HAD PAINTED DRYDEN, IT MIGHT WELL HAVE BEEN A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE TALKED OVER THE BACK FENCE TO EACH OTHER, A TOWN WHERE EVERYONE KNEW AND TRUSTED THEIR NEIGHBOR. NOW EVERYBODY'S LOOKING AT THEIR NEIGHBORS AND THINKING, "COULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? IS IT IN YOU TO DO SOMETHING SO...HORRIFIC?" YOU JUST DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW THE DEMONS THAT SOMEBODY ELSE HAS.
