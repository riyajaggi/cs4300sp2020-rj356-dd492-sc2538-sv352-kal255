 GIVE ME TIME TO THINK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE THAT I DO WANT TO REVISIT THIS. IT WAS A VERY PAINFUL TIME. DRYDEN HAS SEEN IT AGAIN AND AGAIN -- VIOLENCE, MURDER. IT WAS LIKE A SEASON OF MURDERS DESCENDED ON DRYDEN AT LARGE. IT WAS JUST A STRANGE HAPPENING IN A SMALL TOWN. AND IT JUST WENT ON FOR YEARS. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. AND THIS LITTLE BABY WOULD NOT LAST FOREVER OUT HERE IN THE ELEMENTS.

 IT CAME AS A HORRIBLE SHOCK. MOST OF THESE TRAGEDIES ALL REVOLVED AROUND OUR HIGH SCHOOL. THIS TIME IT IS TWO HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS, BOTH 16, BEST FRIENDS. HER DEATH WAS UNEXPECTED. NONE OF IT MAKES SENSE. SINISTER, EVIL, WITH NO REMORSE. THAT'S WHEN YOU QUESTION GOD. MY SISTER LOVED CHRISTMAS. SHE, BASICALLY, IF SHE COULD HAVE CHRISTMAS EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR, SHE WOULD BE IN HEAVEN. YOU KNOW, SHE USUALLY HAD THE WREATH ON THE DOOR AND, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF GARLAND ON THE BANISTER. OF COURSE, THE CENTERPIECE WAS THE TREE ITSELF.

 DO YOU GUYS NEED ANY MORE POP CORN? I KNEW WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS LAST WEEK. I HAD PRACTICE. "I HAD PRACTICE." ENOUGH, MARC. I KNOW, SWEETIE, BUT NOW YOUR FATHER'S MISSING THIS. IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL, MOM. HE'S COMING HOME SOON. DIDN'T GET A REMOTE-CONTROLLED CAR. MARC! YOU KNOW HE'S ALREADY OPENED THEM AND RE-TAPED THE WRAPPING. AND THAT BETTER NOT BE TRUE! HELLO? HEY, SHARON. HOW ARE YOU? WE WERE GOING TO SPEND THAT CHRISTMAS, YOU KNOW, WITH THEM, YOU KNOW, SO THE PLAN WAS THAT WE'D ALL GO DOWN THERE AND, YOU KNOW, WE'D BE SKATING ON THE POND. NO, I FIGURE LIKE USUAL TIME, LIKE, 11:00-ish. YEAH. YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU LATER. BYE. ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE IT. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU! I DIDN'T. YOU'RE SO LUCKY. MERRY CHRISTMAS. HI. CAN I HELP YOU? ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 23rd, I HAD JUST COME INTO THE HOUSE AFTER DOING SOME LAST-MINUTE CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. AND I'D JUST GOTTEN IN THE DOOR WHEN THE PHONE RANG. MY BROTHER CALLED. WHAT HE SAID WAS, "I NEED YOU TO GET EVERYBODY IN THE CAR AND COME RIGHT OVER TO THE HOUSE." AND... I BELIEVE I ASKED WHAT'S GOING ON. HE SAYS, "JUST GET EVERYBODY IN THE CAR AND GET OVER HERE AS QUICKLY AS YOU CAN." Car Three, Car Three, we got a call for a code eight on Ellis Hollow Road in Dryden. JOYCE, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO GO HOME. I'm sure you were, John. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CHANCES THIS IS REAL? 100 to 1. I'M ON MY WAY. I WAS DISPATCHED THERE BECAUSE A NEIGHBOR HAD HEARD AN ALARM GOING OFF. I WAS FIGURING THAT IT WAS ANOTHER FALSE ALARM, WHICH PROBABLY 95% TO 97% OF OUR ALARMS GENERALLY ARE. AND WHEN I SHOWED UP, THERE WAS NOTHING -- YOU COULDN'T HEAR ANYTHING OUTSIDE. HELLO? ANYONE HOME? AND AS I WAS AT THE DOOR, I COULD HEAR THIS CONSTANT BEEPING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE. STATE POLICE, IS ANYBODY HOME? AND AT THAT POINT, I JUST SAID, "WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING HAPPENED, AND MAYBE SOMEBODY BURNED SOMETHING ON THE STOVE AND MIGHT HAVE GOT INJURED, AND SOMEBODY WAS HEADED TO THE HOSPITAL." FROM THE LIVING ROOM, I COULD SMELL... THE SMELL OF GASOLINE. AND WITH THAT, I CAME ACROSS A GASOLINE CAN THAT WAS LAYING ON THE FLOOR IN THE LIVING ROOM. AND AS I LIFTED UP THE PHONE... I REALIZED THAT THE PHONE WIRES WERE PULLED OUT OF THE WALL. AT THAT POINT, I BECAME CONCERNED. JOYCE, I'M GONNA NEED BACKUP HERE. POSSIBLE HOME INVASION. All right, on the way. THAT'S WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR TO WHAT I BELIEVE ENDED UP BEING THE MASTER BEDROOM. AND I OPENED THE DOOR, TRIED TO SWITCH ON THE LIGHT. THE LIGHT BLEW. AND THEN AS I WALKED AROUND THE ROOM, I FOUND THE CHARRED BODY. IT WAS SHOCKING. THIS WAS THE FIRST MURDER VICTIM I HAD EVER SEEN. I KNEW SOMETHING NOT GOOD HAD HAPPENED, BECAUSE MY BROTHER WOULDN'T CALL ME OTHERWISE. SO I, YOU KNOW... MY HUSBAND AND I GOT IN THE CAR WITH MY SON. WHEN WE PULLED INTO THE DRIVEWAY, I SAW THAT DODIE AND TONY WEREN'T THERE YET. WHEN I WALKED INTO THE HOUSE, I REMEMBER MY BROTHER, I BELIEVE HE JUST PUT HIS HANDS ON MY SHOULDERS, YOU KNOW, AND LOOKING AT ME AND SAYING THAT... YOU KNOW, THAT DODIE AND TONY AND SHELBY AND MARC WERE FOUND MURDERED IN THEIR HOME THAT MORNING. OUR INVESTIGATORS SHOWED UP. I GUESS THEY WENT UPSTAIRS, AND THAT'S WHEN SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT IT WAS THE ENTIRE FAMILY THAT WAS KILLED. AT THAT POINT IN TIME, THAT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THIS WAS, YOU KNOW, A MASS MURDER. TO PIECE TOGETHER THE HARRIS FAMILY'S LAST 24 HOURS ALIVE. MORE THAN 50 TROOPERS AND INVESTIGATORS ARE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK, TRACKING DOWN LEADS THEY HOPE WILL LEAD THEM TO A KILLER OR KILLERS. YOU HAD FOUR -- FOUR PEOPLE THAT WERE, YOU KNOW, MURDERED, AND NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING. WE LIVE IN A NIGHTMARE, WE LIVE IN VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED. JOHN, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. CLEAR. NOT IN DRYDEN. IT'S KIND OF A STRANGE THING TO REMEMBER, BUT ONE TIME, DODIE SHARED A BEDROOM, AND WE HAD TWIN BEDS NEXT TO EACH OTHER. AND DURING THE NIGHT, SHE HAD A DREAM THAT ALL THESE SPIDERS WERE COMING DOWN FROM THE CEILING AND LANDING ON HER IN HER BED. AND I WOKE UP ONE MORNING, AND SHE WAS CURLED UP NEXT TO ME IN MY BED. AND, YOU KNOW, LIKE, I'VE JUST NEVER FORGOTTEN THAT BECAUSE I WAS, IT MADE ME FEEL SPECIAL, LIKE SHE CAME TO ME FOR PROTECTION. I BELIEVE THE MATERIALS USED TO BIND SHELBY WERE SOFT RIBBONS OR LIKE A BELT FROM HER PROM DRESS. JUST -- IT'S MIND-BOGGLING TO EVEN THINK WHAT HE WAS PUTTING HER THROUGH. IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE. THIS IS THE LAST PICTURE -- ONE OF THE LAST PICTURES THAT WAS TAKEN OF SHELBY AND HER BOYFRIEND. THIS WAS, YOU KNOW, THE DRESS THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT PROM THAT SHE WENT TO WITH HIM. EVERYTHING WAS BURNT AND BLACKENED, AND... YEAH, I NEVER SAW IT IN THAT COLOR. SHE JUST -- SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL. IT KIND OF -- IT MAKES YOUR BLOOD BOIL. KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED TO SHELBY, YOU'D WANT TO, YOU KNOW... FOR LACK OF -- YOU'D WANT TO KILL A GUY LIKE THAT, IF IT WAS YOUR OWN DAUGHTER. THAT'S HOW ANY FATHER WOULD FEEL. I THINK THAT'S ONLY NATURAL. THE INVESTIGATION OF A QUADRUPLE HOMICIDE AND ARSON THAT OCCURRED ON DECEMBER 23, 1989, IS BEING CONDUCTED. THE BODIES WERE DISCOVERED AT THE FAMILY RESIDENCE AT ELLIS HOLLOW ROAD IN THE TOWN OF DRYDEN. HEY, JOHN? OUR SUPERINTENDENT AT THE TIME SAID IT WAS THE WORST CRIME IN THE 72-YEAR HISTORY OF THE STATE POLICE. IT WAS MY FIRST HOMICIDE CASE, AND I WILL NEVER FORGET IT. THERE ARE NO PRINTS, NO HAIR -- NOTHING, ANYWHERE -- EXCEPT BULLETS. - THEY WERE SHOT?! - YEAH, BEFORE THE FIRE. - YOU GOT BALLISTICS? - .22. JOHN, I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. NOT IN DRYDEN. WE FIND OUT THAT THE THREE -- MR. AND MRS. HARRIS AND MARC WERE ALL HOODED. YOU ALL RIGHT? I... I JUST NEED SOME AIR. AND THEN YOU TAKE THIS HOME, AND YOU'D TELL YOUR WIFE. MY DAUGHTER, SHE WAS AFRAID THAT WHOEVER DID IT WAS GONNA COME AFTER ME BECAUSE I WAS IN, YOU KNOW, MY NAME WAS IN THE PAPER ALL THE TIME. IT WAS A SCARY TIME, I THINK, FOR EVERYBODY, BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE LOCKING THEIR DOORS. YOU KNOW, OF COURSE WHEN YOU KNOW SOMEBODY'S ON THE RUN WHO JUST EXECUTED A WHOLE FAMILY. IT REMINDED ME OF, LIKE, THE SHARON TATE MURDER. AND "IN COLD BLOOD." YOU KNOW, SUPER-SENSATIONALIZED, BECAUSE THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE BOUNDS OF WHAT ANY OF US ORDINARILY PERCEIVE AS HUMAN NATURE. CHERYL WIGGINS, 9 NEWS, DRYDEN. GOOD. GOOD. I DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO LET MY KIDS GO ANYWHERE. LIKE, EVEN TO SCHOOL. ONE OF MY FANTASIES WAS THAT MAYBE, LIKE, THEY WERE GONNA GO FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE. YOU KNOW, SLEEPING WITH ALL MY DOORS LOCKED, THE LIGHTS ALL ON AROUND THE HOUSE... A KNIFE UNDER MY PILLOW. IT WAS A STRANGE EXPERIENCE. A LOT OF TIMES, PEOPLE WILL RETURN TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT EVERYTHING OR, YOU KNOW, TO SEE IF IT'S BEING WATCHED. 7:00 AT NIGHT TO 7:00 IN THE MORNING WAS THE SHIFT. AND, UM, IT WAS -- I MEAN, THAT WAS JUST ME, THE TROOP CAR, AND MY COFFEE AND WHATEVER. AND THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT MAYBE THE PERSON WAS GONNA COME BACK. YOUR MIND STARTS PLAYING TRICKS ON YOU, YOU KNOW. WIND BLOWS, THE TREES MOVE, AND YOU CAN'T TELL IF -- IS IT OUTSIDE, IS IT INSIDE. How you doing out there, Martin? GOD, JOYCE, YOU SCARED ME HALF TO DEATH. HAVEN'T SEEN A SUSPECT YET, BUT... I'M COLD AND... JUST BORED. SO THIS -- THIS DOLL WAS A BABY DOLL THAT WAS GIVEN TO MY SISTER DODIE ON HER VERY FIRST CHRISTMAS. I WAS SO NUMB, AND IT WAS STILL VERY UNREAL TO ME. BUT WALKING INTO THE HOUSE, AND WHEN I SAW THIS DOLL, AND I BROKE DOWN. THERE'S, YOU KNOW, ANOTHER DISCOLORATION WHICH WAS A RESULT OF THE FIRE, YOU KNOW, THAT COULDN'T BE REPAIRED, BUT, BASICALLY, I HAD A NEW WIG PUT ON HER TO BRING HER BACK TO HER ORIGINAL... BEAUTY. IT'S A DIFFICULT TIME FOR THOSE THAT ARE LEFT. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT NOW NEED LOVE AND SUPPORT. IT'S THE POLICE THAT NEED THE CONFESSION OF A GUILTY CONSCIENCE OR A LUCKY BREAK. IT WAS HARD TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT KIND OF FEAR THAT THEY EXPERIENCED IN THOSE MOMENTS. JUST TELL US WHAT YOU WANT. POLICE WANT TO FIND OUT IF ANYBODY KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT LAST FRIDAY'S QUADRUPLE MURDERS. CAPTAIN, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ON THIS CASE AT ALL? THE COMMUNITY WAS CONCERNED BECAUSE WE WEREN'T GETTING ANYWHERE -- OR THEY BELIEVED WE WEREN'T GETTING ANYWHERE. - JOHN HERE? - YEAH. HE WAS THE FIRST ONE ON THE SCENE. JOHN? YEAH, YEAH, DAVE. SORRY TO HAVE TO CALL YOU IN. WELL, I HEAR ALL WE HAVE SO FAR ARE YOUR FINGERPRINTS? THE HOUSE WAS WIPED CLEAN. I MEAN, IT WAS CLEAN. IT WAS -- IT WAS ALMOST LIKE IT WAS PROFESSIONALLY CLEANED. SO A ROBBERY-TURNED-QUADRUPLE- HOMICIDE, AND YOU'VE GOT NOTHING? THE TOWN'S GOING NUTS. DID YOU SWEEP THE NEIGHBORHOOD? YES. JUST GO DO IT AGAIN. I'LL LOOK THIS OVER. I LIVE ON THIS VERY STEEP HILL, AND IT WAS STARTING TO SNOW A LOT. AND ON OUR WAY HOME, I SAW SOMEBODY RIDING A BICYCLE IN THIS SNOWSTORM. AND I'M LIKE, "MY GOSH." AND SO WE SLOWED DOWN TO LOOK AND SEE WHO IT MIGHT BE. SO I TOOK IN A GOOD VIEW OF THIS PERSON RIDING THE BICYCLE. HE WAS A BLACK PERSON, WHICH WAS NOT PREVALENT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, ESPECIALLY AT THAT TIME. HE HAD ON A PARKA, SO ALL I SAW REALLY WAS HIS FACE. I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW HIM, AND IT WAS SNOWY... SO I KEPT GOING. HE RODE HIS BIKE TO THE HOUSE AND... YOU KNOW, THAT'S HOW THINGS STARTED. MERRY CHRISTMAS! HI. CAN I HELP YOU? HEY, MY TIRE'S BUSTED. WELL, LISTEN, COME ON IN. YOU MUST BE FREEZING OUTSIDE. - THANKS. SHE WOULD OPEN THE DOOR AND IF SOMEBODY NEEDED HELP, SHE WOULD HELP THEM. THAT'S WHO SHE WAS. HEY, MARC, DO WE HAVE A PUMP? GUYS, THIS IS... I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T GET YOUR NAME. DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT? EVERYBODY SHUT UP! WHAT ARE -- WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I SAID SHUT UP. WHO ELSE IS HERE? NO ONE. MY HUSBAND'S AT WORK. NOBODY ELSE IS HERE? NO, IT'S JUST THE THREE OF US. JUST -- JUST TELL US WHAT YOU WANT. MY NEPHEW AND SISTER HAD BEEN TAKEN INTO MY NEPHEW'S ROOM, AND, YOU KNOW, TIED UP AND... PILLOWCASES PUT ON THEIR HEADS, THAT TYPE OF THING. BY, YOU KNOW, THE TIME TONY WENT HOME, HE WOULD HAVE HAD THEM, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY UPSTAIRS AND, YOU KNOW, TONY ENTERED INTO THAT PARTICULAR SCENE. HON? MARC? SHELBY? WHOSE BIKE IS THAT OUT THERE? HONEY? - TONY?! MERRY CHRISTMAS! HO-HO-HO! GUYS? HIS GREATEST FEAR HAD TO BE FOR HIS FAMILY. I'M SURE HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HIMSELF. I MEAN, THAT WOULD BE THE LAST THING. IT WOULD BE MORE HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILDREN. IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO TRY TO... TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT KIND OF FEAR THAT THEY EXPERIENCED IN THOSE MOMENTS. THE POLICE BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS A ROBBERY GONE OUT OF CONTROL. MRS. HARRIS HAD A GIFT SHOP ON THE PREMISES. IT WAS JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS WHEN THE CRIME OCCURRED. SO THE THINKING WAS THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET CASH FROM THE TILL. THEY'RE OUT, AND THEY'RE USING THE CREDIT CARDS. THEY BOUGHT TWO PAIRS OF SNEAKERS, A TV, AND $500 EARRINGS... WITH THE HARRIS' CREDIT CARD... FOR CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. HOW SICK IS THAT? BACK THEN, WE DIDN'T HAVE -- YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T HAVE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. SO NOW THEY TRACKED THESE SALES CLERKS DOWN. THEY'RE ASKING THEM WHAT THEY SAW AND GIVE ME A DESCRIPTION. NOW THEY HAVE IT NARROWED DOWN. AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A BLACK MALE, ANY AGE 25 TO 30 OR THEREABOUTS, AND AN ELDERLY, YOU KNOW, BLACK WOMAN. THE PRIEST WHO OFFICIATED AT THEIR FUNERAL WAS THE PRIEST WHO HAD MARRIED THEM. I DIDN'T WANT TO ADMIT BEING ANGRY AT GOD, BUT I CERTAINLY NO LONGER BELIEVED IN PRAYER. BECAUSE THEY WERE THERE, AND THEN THEY WERE GONE. BASED ON THE SKETCHES AND THE LEADS THAT CAME IN, THE SUBJECTS WERE IDENTIFIED AS MICHAEL KINGE AND HIS MOTHER SHIRLEY KINGE. EVERYBODY WHO WAS TIED TO THIS COMMUNITY HAD SOME SORT OF CONNECTION TO THE HARRIS FAMILY OR THE KINGE FAMILY. YEAH, MICHAEL HAD A HISTORY OF ARMED ROBBERY. HE HAD AN OUTSTANDING WARRANT FOR ROBBERY FROM DOWN STATE WHEN THIS OCCURRED. EVERYBODY KNEW HIM 'CAUSE HE WAS A BAD, MEAN GUY. SHIRLEY WAS A, FOR THE MOST PART, A CLEANING WOMAN. SHE ALSO WAS A DESK WOMAN AT A LOCAL BED AND BREAKFAST HERE. HAD VIRTUALLY NO CRIMINAL HISTORY WHATSOEVER. THE THEORY WAS THAT IT WAS TWO PROFESSIONAL CLEANERS WHO HAD CLEANED THIS PLACE. MICHAEL HAD ALSO WORKED AS A CLEANER. SO THE THEORY WAS THAT MICHAEL HAD MET WITH HIS MOTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, AND THE TWO OF THEM HAD CLEANED THAT HOUSE TOGETHER. IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT THESE PEOPLE DIDN'T SLIP THROUGH OUR FINGERS. GOD. SUSPECTS ARE HEADED NORTH ON MAIN AND WATTS. SHIRLEY KINGE, SHE KNEW SHE WAS BEING WATCHED, AND DEFINITELY MICHAEL KINGE WAS HYPERSENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT HE COULD HAVE BEEN WATCHED. AND WHEN YOU'D HEARD THE NEWS BROADCASTER SAYING THAT A LITTLE GIRL WAS MISSING... DRYDEN'S NOW STRUCK AGAIN. I JUST -- I MISS HER VERY MUCH. PEOPLE FELT THEY WERE CURSED. THEY FELT SOMETHING OTHERWORLDLY WAS HAPPENING. WHY DOES LIGHTNING KEEP STRIKING HERE? AND THEIR TWO CHILDREN, SHELBY AND MARC, WERE ALL SHOT IN THE HEAD WITH A SMALL-CALIBER WEAPON. IT WAS LIKE A SEASON OF MURDERS DESCENDED ON DRYDEN. WHILE THE HARRIS MURDERS WERE STILL UNSOLVED, YOU HAD ALIZA MAY BUSH. - Dryden Fire and Rescue. - YEAH, HELLO. I -- MY DAUGHTER'S MISSING. NO, SHE'S GONE. What is your address? AT THE END OF WEST DRYDEN ROAD. When was the last time you saw her? SHE JUST WALKED OUT THE HOUSE, I DON'T KNOW. Can you describe what she was wearing? CAN YOU JUST PLEASE COME QUICK? THE TWO-YEAR-OLD VANISHED FROM HER HOME FRIDAY MORNING. IN AN EFFORT TO GET HER DAUGHTER, ALIZA'S 24-YEAR-OLD MOTHER MADE A TEARFUL PLEA FOR THE KIDNAPPER TO GIVE HER CHILD BACK. I JUST -- I MISS HER VERY MUCH. AND THE FAMILY, EVERYBODY, IF YOU COULD JUST CONTACT ME AND MAYBE DROP HER OFF OR THEY WOULD LET US KNOW WHERE SO WE COULD PICK HER UP. I MEAN, I WANT HER HOME BEFORE HER BIRTHDAY. UM... IT WAS ALWAYS DRYDEN. AND WHEN YOU'D HEARD THE NEWS BROADCASTERS SAYING THAT THE LITTLE GIRL WAS MISSING, DRYDEN'S NOW STRUCK AGAIN. YOUR MIND IS JUST LIKE, "WHAT?! HOW?" ANOTHER TRAGEDY, ANOTHER... MNH-MNH. WITH THE TWO CASES BEING SO CLOSE TOGETHER, BACK TO BACK, I THINK EVERYBODY IN THE AREA WAS ON EDGE AT THIS TIME. AS TIME PROGRESSED, WE BECAME MORE AND MORE ALARMED AT THIS. THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT...ALIZA WAS TAKEN BY THE SAME PERSON THAT HAD MURDERED THE HARRISES. I THINK, YEAH, THE FEELING IS WHY DOES LIGHTNING KEEP STRIKING HERE? WHAT IS GOING ON? SUPPOSEDLY, MICHAEL KINGE SAID THAT HE WASN'T GONNA GO BACK TO PRISON. AND HE MIGHT NOT GO WITHOUT A FIGHT. ALL RIGHT, LISTEN. OUR SUSPECT IS CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS. LET'S NOT KEEP IT THAT WAY. THIS IS THE LAYOUT. COMMIT IT TO MEMORY. THE ONLY SURPRISE I WANT IS MICHAEL KINGE'S WHEN WE BREAK DOWN HIS DOOR. THEY GOT A BABY IN THERE? YEAH, BUT THE KID SLEEPS ONLY IN THE ROOM THAT'S MARKED OR IN HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENT. SHIRLEY KINGE AND HER MOM LIVED ON ONE SIDE, AND MICHAEL KINGE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND AND THEIR ONE-YEAR-OLD LIVED ON THE OTHER. GOT THE FLOOR PLAN SO THAT THEY... THEY KNEW WHERE THE BABY WAS WAS REALLY IMPORTANT. MOST IMPORTANTLY IS WHERE WAS MICHAEL. AND HOW ARE WE GONNA GET THROUGH THIS WITHOUT GETTING... KILLED? WE'RE GOING IN THE BACK DOOR. LINDA, YOU'RE STAYING PUT IN CASE THEY RUN. EVERYBODY HAD A JOB TO DO. IF EVERYBODY DOES THEIR JOB, HOPEFULLY, NOBODY WILL GET HURT. BENO'S UP IN THE CHOPPER. ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. THEY HAD THIS THING SET UP LIKE A MOVIE SCRIPT. YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, AND THIS IS HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT. AND THERE IS NO SECOND TAKE. CLEAR! BABY'S HERE! MICHAEL KINGE, STATE POLICE. PUT YOUR HANDS UP AND COME OUT. YOU'RE SITTING THERE, AND YOU LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA -- NO IDEA WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. MICHAEL KINGE, STATE POLICE! PUT YOUR HANDS UP AND COME OUT. MICHAEL?! MICHAEL, NO! NO, NO, NO, NO! MICHAEL, NO! NO! MICHAEL! BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT NOBODY WAS HURT AND THE PERPETRATOR WAS DECEASED, I -- TO BE FRANKLY WITH YOU, I TOOK A DEEP BREATH, A SIGH OF RELIEF. "POLICE DISPEL RUMOR THAT MISSING GIRL WAS IN HOME OF SUSPECT." I KNEW WHO WAS IN THE HOUSE. AND I WOULD KNOW FOR SURE THAT THAT WASN'T THE CASE. THAT WAS DISPELLED. I DO BELIEVE THAT SHIRLEY KINGE WAS TERRIFIED OF HER SON. SHE BROKE DOWN AND SAID THAT HE WAS A GREAT BOY, BUT HE BECAME A MONSTER. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE WAS IN THE HOUSE. WHETHER IT BE BEFORE OR AFTER THE FACT. COULD SHE -- YOU KNOW, COULD SHE HAVE BEEN THERE? I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT SHE COMMITTED THE MURDERS. MICHAEL KILLED THE HARRISES, AND I BELIEVE THAT SHE HELPED HIM CLEAN THE HOUSE UP. ACCORDING TO THE POLICE, HER INVOLVEMENT IN THE COVER-UP OF THE CRIME WAS A PARTICIPATION IN A ROBBERY, AND THAT SHE EXPECTED TO USE THE FRUITS OF THE ROBBERY AFTERWARDS. THIS IS THE GAS CAN THAT WAS IN THE LIVING ROOM OF THE HARRIS RESIDENCE THE DAY I ARRIVED, AND ALSO THE SAME GAS CAN THAT I LIFTED THE FINGERPRINT FROM. BECAUSE HER FINGERPRINT WAS FOUND ON A GAS CAN, WE HAD NO DOUBT THAT SHE'D BEEN IN THERE. ...ARSON IN THE THIRD DEGREE. DO YOU FIND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY? AND NOW SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES SAY THEY NEED ALL THE HELP THEY CAN GET. IS IT A CURSE? IS IT A BLACK CLOUD? YOU KNOW, WHY US? I WAS NOT AT THE HARRIS HOME ON DECEMBER 22nd OR DECEMBER 23rd. I'M SORRY... THAT JUSTICE HAS TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER DAY. THIS IS THE GAS CAN THAT WAS IN THE LIVING ROOM OF THE HARRIS RESIDENCE THE DAY I ARRIVED, AND ALSO THE SAME GAS CAN THAT I LIFTED THE FINGERPRINT FROM. DAVID HARDING WAS LYING. IT WAS LATER DETERMINED HE PLANTED THE PRINT THAT WAS KEY TO THIS CASE. THERE WERE NO PRINTS. I MEAN, THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. BUT I ALSO CAN'T COMPREHEND HOW SHE... COULD LET THE COMMUNITY GO THROUGH WHAT SHE LET THE COMMUNITY GO THROUGH... ...FOR OVER SIX, EIGHT WEEKS, KNOWING WHAT HER SON DID. AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IF ONE OF MY CHILDREN DID WHAT MICHAEL DID, I WOULD TURN HIM IN TO THE POLICE. IT MADE NO SENSE IN 1990, MADE NO SENSE NOW. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE LINKING SHIRLEY KINGE TO THE CRIME SCENE. I USED TO DRIVE BY EVERY YEAR ON THE DATE ON THE WAY IN TO WORK. JUST SAY A LITTLE PRAYER WHEN I DROVE BY AND STILL OFTEN WONDER WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH THAT NIGHT. AND... JUST THINK -- THINK ABOUT WHAT MY HAVE BEEN. THEY'RE AT PEACE, AND THEY'RE TOGETHER. YOU KNOW, THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS I CAN... MAKE IT. WILL IT EVER BE OVER FOR YOU? NO, I DON'T THINK IT WILL EVER BE OVER FOR US BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE THAT VOID THAT'S BEEN, YOU KNOW -- THAT WE'LL HAVE TO ALWAYS LIVE WITH NOW. I FEEL SHE IS WITH ME. YOU KNOW, IT'S... YOU KNOW, THERE'S A SPIRIT THAT SHE HAD THAT, YOU KNOW, DIDN'T DIE WITH HER. INVESTIGATORS HAVE BEEN WORKING ROUND THE CLOCK WITH LITTLE SLEEP AND EVEN FEWER CLUES. I'VE GOT A TWO-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER MYSELF. AND AS SOON AS I HEARD ON TV, CHILLS WENT UP AND DOWN MY SPINE. WE HAVE TO ASSUME EVERYTHING IS IN PLAY ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- KIDNAPPING, LOST CHILD. EVERYTHING WAS STILL IN PLAY. WE HAD NOT RULED ANYTHING OUT. BECAUSE A CHILD'S LIFE WAS AT STAKE HERE, THE FBI WAS SUMMONED TO COME IN AND ASSIST US BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING A KIDNAPPING. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A TRADITIONAL KIDNAPPING IN AS MUCH AS THERE'S BEEN NO RANSOM ASKED FOR. NOW EVERYBODY'S LOOKING AT THEIR NEIGHBORS AND THINKING... "COULD YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT? IS IT IN YOU TO DO SOMETHING SO HORRIFIC?" IF ANY OF THE LEADS ARE SOLID, POLICE ARE BEING VERY TIGHT-LIPPED ABOUT IT. CHERYL WIGGINS, 9 NEWS, DRYDEN. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. AND THE LONGER THE SEARCH GOES ON... THE MORE YOU START TO FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS DONE AND WE GOTTA GET IT DONE SOON. WE JUST WENT FULL BORE, 100% IN HOPES OF FINDING HER BEFORE... BEFORE SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENED. WE'RE GONNA FIND THIS LITTLE GIRL. AND THEN DOOMSDAY COMES WHEN... THE REAL TRUTH CAME OUT.
