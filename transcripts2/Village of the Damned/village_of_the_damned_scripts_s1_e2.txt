 CAN YOU JUST PLEASE COME QUICK? A LITTLE GIRL WAS MISSING. DRYDEN'S NOW STRUCK AGAIN. YOUR MIND IS LIKE, "WHAT? HOW?" I JUST -- I MISS HER VERY MUCH, AND THE FAMILY AND EVERYBODY... IF HE COULD JUST CONTACT ME AND MAYBE DROP HER OFF SOMEWHERE, BUT LET US KNOW WHERE SO WE CAN PICK HER UP. I MEAN, I WANT HER HOME BEFORE HER BIRTHDAY. UM... WE ALL KNOW SHE'S MISSING, ABDUCTED. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG HERE. I HAD NO IDEA THIS THING WOULD END IN THE MANNER THAT IT DID. IT'S A NOTEBOOK I KEPT IN 1990 FOR THE YEAR, THE ONLY YEAR I KEPT ONE.

 MY WIFE WANTED TO THROW IT AWAY A COUPLE TIMES. I WOULDN'T LET HER. "CHRISTINE LANE REPORTED 2- YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER MISSING FROM APARTMENT. THERE'S FEAR SHE HAS WALKED AWAY." THAT THE WAS THE MAIN CONCERN -- TRY TO FIND HER AS QUICK AS WE COULD. I WAS IN THE DISPATCH OFFICE WITH OUR CHIEF INVESTIGATOR, AND THE CALL CAME IN, SO I RESPONDED TO THE APARTMENT COMPLEX AND SPOKE WITH CHRISTINE LANE. MA'AM, I'M DETECTIVE HUETHER. THANK GOD. YEAH, MY LITTLE GIRL -- SHE'S -- SHE'S MISSING, AND... MA'AM. UM...UM... SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD BROUGHT SOME TRASH OUT TO THE DUMPSTER. I WENT TO TAKE THE TRASH OUT TO THE END OF SIDEWALK, AND SHE CAME WITH ME, 'CAUSE SHE ALWAYS DOES. I HAD TO GO BACK, 'CAUSE I... I FORGOT ONE OF THE BAGS -- I FORGOT ONE OF THE TRASH BAGS. AND YOU LEFT HER OUTSIDE? IT WAS -- I JUST STEPPED INSIDE. I FOUND -- I FOUND THIS. THE CHILD WAS GONE, BUT ONE OF HER MITTENS WAS LAYING IN THE DRIVEWAY. GOD, SHE MUST BE FREEZING. IT'S SO COLD OUT. IT'S GONNA BE OKAY. I TOLD HER, "HOW FAR COULD THIS BABY HAVE GONE? WE'RE GONNA FIND HER REAL QUICK." IF YOU KNEW CHRISTINE AT THE TIME, WHETHER YOU WERE GOOD FRIENDS OR OLD FRIENDS WITH HER YOU KNEW THAT BABY CAME FIRST -- ALWAYS. - THAT'S SO FUNNY. - THAT'S SO FUNNY! CAN YOU FILL IT HALF-WATER, HALF-JUICE? ALL RIGHTY. COOL YOUR JETS. WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT, JETS? IS THAT 'CAUSE YOU'RE AN AIRPLANE?! WAH-WAH-WAH-WAH! - THERE YOU GO. ALIZA WAS THE CUTEST LITTLE GIRL. YOU COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER CHILD. SHE HAD A LOT OF HAIR -- IT WAS ALWAYS IN HER FACE, AND SHE JUST LOVED TO PLAY WITH THE ANIMALS. SHE CALLED ME "DADDY" ONCE AND A WHILE. SHE'S SO CUTE. I THINK SHE'S WARMING UP TO YOU. THANK YOU. I CAN DEAL WITH THAT. MWAH! I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. IT WAS A BAD DAY -- IT'S TERRIBLE. IT WAS -- IT WAS BLOWING PRETTY GOOD, VERY FEW SPOTS OF SUNLIGHT THAT DAY. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE, AND THE LONGER THE SEARCH GOES ON, THE MORE YOU START TO FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS DONE, AND WE GOT TO GET IT DONE SOON. THIS LITTLE GIRL, THIS LITTLE BABY WILL NOT LAST FOREVER OUT HERE IN THE ELEMENTS. BUT AS THE DAY PROGRESSED, THE WEATHER DETERIORATED, AND IT STARTED SNOWING FAIRLY HARD. PEOPLE BROUGHT THEIR CHILDREN... TO SEARCH. IT WAS VERY UNORGANIZED. BY THE TIME I GOT THERE, IT WAS -- KID'S PRINTS ALL OVER, ALL OVER THE PLACE. OF COURSE, THERE WAS JUST SO MANY PEOPLE HOLLERING AND DOGS BARKING AND KIDS -- YOU COULDN'T TELL IF SOMEBODY ANSWERED YOU OR NOT. IF SHE WAS TO ANSWER YOU, YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO HEARD IT. ON FEBRUARY 2nd, I CAME TO WORK AT 4:00 P. M., AND MY JOB IS TO GO OUT THERE AND INTERVIEW ALL THE TENANTS OF ALL THE APARTMENTS THAT WE COULD FIND AT HOME. WE ASKED IF THEY HAD SEEN ALIZA, A 2-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO BE OUT IN A PINK SUIT, OR IF PEOPLE MAY HAVE SPOTTED HER AND PICKED HER UP. IF YOU'VE SEEN ALIZA OR HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT HER WHEREABOUTS, WE'D LIKE YOUR HELP. ALIZA IS 3-FOOT TALL AND WEIGHS 40 POUNDS. AS TIME PROGRESSED, WE BECAME MORE AND MORE ALARMED AT THIS. THE SEARCH CONTINUED TILL DUSK. Attention all units, attention all units -- Calling off the search for the night. BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER CONDITIONS, IT WOULD NOT BE VERY LIKELY SHE WOULD SURVIVE THE NIGHT. THE DRIVE HOME WAS HEARTBREAKING. IT'S DARK, IT'S COLD, IT'S SNOWING, IT'S WINDY... AND THIS 2-YEAR-OLD BABY OUT WANDERING AROUND IN THE WOODS NOT KNOWING WHERE SHE WAS, WHY SHE WAS THERE, HUNGRY, TIRED, COLD, AND FRIGHTENED. AND IT WAS SO CLOSE TO THE HIGHWAY, IT WAS RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM THE COUNTY JAIL. WHO KNOWS? I THOUGHT IT WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE PICKED HER UP ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD -- KIDNAPPED HER. "ALIZA BUSH INVESTIGATION -- FOLLOW-UP LEADS. INTERVIEWED CHRISTINE LANE, FEBRUARY 3rd." CHRIS, WE JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT A FEW THINGS. I ALREADY TOLD YOU EVERYTHING. I KNOW, BUT LET'S JUST GO THROUGH AGAIN, OKAY? WELL, WE STARTED RIGHT OFF FROM THE MORNING -- WHAT SHE WAS DOING WHEN ALIZA DISAPPEARED, AND, WELL, WE DEFINITELY WEREN'T AGGRESSIVE. IT WAS JUST A LOW-KEY QUESTION-AND-ANSWER SESSION, ASKING HER BASIC QUESTIONS. GET HER ALL READY -- COAT ON, GLOVES ON. DURING HER INTERVIEW, THERE WAS NEVER ANY TEARS, SHE NEVER GOT EMOTIONAL. WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN SIT THERE AND NOT BE EMOTIONAL, BUT SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE TOO SHORT A TIME SPAN FOR A SMALL GIRL LIKE ALIZA TO GO MISSING. I MEAN, HONEST TO GOD -- IT COULDN'T HAVE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES. OKAY. SO FIVE MINUTES? MAYBE. YOU AREN'T TRYING TO PROTECT SOMEONE, ARE YOU, CHRIS? NO. THE ONLY DOUBT THAT I CAN REMEMBER COMING UP IS ED DIDN'T LIKE THE TIMING. THE GIRL COULDN'T HAVE DISAPPEARED THAT QUICKLY UNLESS SOMEONE HAS HAPPENED TO COME ALONG IN A CAR AND GRAB HER AND TAKE OFF. THE THREE OF US STOOD AND TALKED AND... WE JUST COME TO A GENERAL CONSENSUS. WE -- WE BELIEVED HER. THE FIRST THING THAT PEOPLE SAY WHEN SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS, THEY'RE LIKE, "MY GOD." YOU START ASKING LET THIS LITTLE GIRL COME THROUGH, LET HER BE FOUND. IF YOU'VE SEEN ALIZA OR HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT HER WHEREABOUTS, WE'D LIKE YOUR HELP. ALIZA IS 3-FOOT TALL AND WEIGHS 40 POUNDS. WE'RE GONNA FIND THIS LITTLE GIRL, AND THEN DOOMSDAY COMES WHEN... THE REAL TRUTH CAME OUT. STILL NO TRACE OF ALIZA BUSH. MISSING SIGNS WITH THE TODDLER'S PICTURE ARE PLASTERED ALL OVER THE SOUTHERN TIER, AND WHILE MISSING SIGNS ARE EASY TO FIND, ALIZA IS NOT. I'VE LIVED HERE MY WHOLE LIFE, AND... THIS WAS A SAFE TOWN. I WAS SCARED TO GO TO SLEEP AT NIGHT. LITTLE KIDS AT HOME, AND, YOU KNOW, YOU'D THINK, "MY GOD, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?" YOU'RE CONSTANTLY ON THE LOOKOUT. HOW DOES A COMMUNITY FEEL SAFE ANYMORE? EVERYBODY WAS BROUGHT IN FOR A POLYGRAPH TEST. OBVIOUSLY THE LITTLE GIRL'S MOTHER WOULD BE A SUSPECT, GREG, THE BABY'S FATHER, THE MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND -- THEY WOULD BE THE THREE MAIN SUSPECTS. DO YOU INTEND TO LIE TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING TODAY? NO. GREG'S A GOOD GUY. HE'S A HARD-WORKING MAN -- NEVER BEEN A BIG PROBLEM FOR ANYBODY. COULD YOU TAKE ME TO ALIZA RIGHT NOW? NO. I TOLD GREG -- I SAYS, "GREG, WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS FOR A LONG TIME, AND YOU KNOW ME. I'M A STRAIGHT SHOOTER, AND I WANT YOU TO SHOOT STRAIGHT WITH ME. IF YOU ARE INVOLVED IN THIS, TELL ME NOW AND WE'LL GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT." DID YOU LIE ABOUT ALIZA DISAPPEARING? NO. HE SAID HE WAS NOT INVOLVED, NOT AT ALL. "BASED UPON THE POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION OF GREGORY BUSH THAT HE WAS TRUTHFUL TO THE AFOREMENTIONED QUESTIONS." HE HAD PASSED HIS POLYGRAPH TEST. THEY CAME OUT AND TOLD ME. I HAD NO REASON TO LIE ABOUT ANYTHING. DO YOU INTEND TO LIE TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING TODAY? NO. CAN YOU TAKE ME TO ALIZA RIGHT NOW? NO. "IT IS THE OPINION OF THE POLYGRAPHIST, BASED UPON THE POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION OF KEVIN DEXTER, THAT HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH TO THE ABOVE LISTED QUESTIONS." DO YOU INTEND TO LIE TO ME ABOUT ANYTHING TODAY? NO. IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE, EVEN ONCE, HAVE YOU EVER HURT ANYTHING? NO. DID YOU LIE TO AUTHORITIES ABOUT ALIZA DISAPPEARING? NO. WELL, WE HAD HEARD THAT SHE HAD PASSED IT, SO NOW WE'RE BACK AT SQUARE ONE. THE FBI CAME IN -- WE HAD AN 800 NUMBER PUT IN, AND THAT OPENED THE FLOOD GATES TO MANY, MANY, MANY PHONE CALLS. IT SEEMS LIKE BACK IN THAT YEAR... ...EVERY 2-YEAR-OLD MUST HAVE WORE A PINK WINTER SUIT, YOU KNOW? Hi. I'm calling 'cause I saw the picture of the little girl on TV, the one that's missing. I RECALLED ONE PSYCHIC TOLD US TO CHECK A EMPTY STOREFRONT WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE COVERED IN PAPER IN ROCHESTER, NEW YORK. I saw the news story of Aliza. I think I saw someone walking with a little girl near Dryden. EVERY TIME YOU TURN AROUND, YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER... BASICALLY A WILD GOOSE CHASE, BUT YOU GOT TO CHASE IT. I was on Main Street. I saw an older man and a woman walk with a girl that... A PACKAGE WAS DELIVERED TO CHRISTINE LANE. THEY FOUND A MITTEN, THE MATCHING MITTEN TO THE ONE THAT WAS IN THE DRIVEWAY. SHERIFF HUETHER, IT'S CHRISTINE. WELL, AS SOON AS THE MITTEN CAME IN, IT NOW LOOKED LIKE WE HAD AN ABDUCTION. AND OF COURSE THAT CHANGED THE WHOLE RULES OF THE GAME. THEY GAVE US THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE WAS STILL ALIVE. I SAID, "AT LEAST SHE'S ALIVE," YOU KNOW? ONE OF HER GLOVES WAS FOUND OUTSIDE HER LANSING HOME, AND THIS WEEK THE OTHER WAS MAILED TO ALIZA'S MOTHER, CHRISTINE LANE. THIS HASN'T INVESTIGATORS TREATING THE CASE A KIDNAPPING. IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A TRADITIONAL KIDNAPPING IN AS MUCH AS THERE'S BEEN NO RANSOM. RECEIVING THE GLOVE IN THE MAIL, YES, IT -- IT DID SEEM VERY SUSPICIOUS -- A LITTLE TOO THEATRICAL. IN AN EFFORT TO GET HER DAUGHTER, ALIZA'S 24-YEAR-OLD MOTHER MADE A TEARFUL PLEA FOR THE KIDNAPPER TO GIVE HER CHILD BACK. I JUST -- I MISS HER VERY MUCH. I MEAN, I WANT HER HOME BEFORE HER BIRTHDAY. THE FAMILY AND ALL HAVE BOUGHT HER PRESENTS, AND WE'RE WAITING FOR HER TO BE BROUGHT HOME. UM... NOW WE -- WE THOUGHT WE HAD A PROBLEM, A BIG PROBLEM. IT'S BEEN A WEEK, AND STILL NO TRACE OF ALIZA BUSH. IN AN EFFORT TO GET HER DAUGHTER, ALIZA'S 24-YEAR-OLD MOTHER MADE A TEARFUL PLEA FOR THE KIDNAPPER TO GIVE HER CHILD BACK. I MEAN, I WANT HER HOME BEFORE HER BIRTHDAY. THE FAMILY AND ALL HAVE BOUGHT HER PRESENTS, AND WE'RE WAITING FOR HER TO BE BROUGHT HOME. UM... WHAT A HELL OF AN ACTOR. SHE PUT ON A GOOD ACT, DIDN'T SHE? A VERY GOOD ACT. SHE HAD PEOPLE BELIEVING IT, TOO. WE TOLD CHRISTINE THAT WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN ABDUCTION OR NOT, BECAUSE BY NOW WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN SOMETHING. AND I BELIEVE IT WAS THE NEXT DAY THAT, LO AND BEHOLD, WE GOT A MITTEN. NOW WE -- WE THOUGHT WE HAD A PROBLEM, A BIG PROBLEM. HELLO AGAIN, CHRISTINE. YOU KNOW OFFICER MANLEY. THIS IS AGENT O'BRIEN. IS THERE ANYTHING NEW? IS ALIZA OKAY? SO, THAT PACKAGE THAT YOU RECEIVED -- WE WANTED TO ASK YOU -- - SOMEONE HAS HER, DON'T THEY? WHO IS IT? WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL US THAT. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. JODY DOWN AT THE GENERAL STORE SAYS THAT SHE SAW YOU MAIL A PACKAGE THE OTHER DAY A COUPLE HOURS AFTER I TALKED TO YOU. WE ALREADY GOT HER ON RECORD. CHRISTINE, SHE SAID IT'S THE SAME PACKAGE THAT YOU BROUGHT US WITH THE MITTEN. SHE WAS LIKE THAT WHEN I FOUND HER. "IT WAS ABOUT 8:30, I -- I PUT HER TO BED, AND I HEARD HER IN THERE PLAYING, SO I JUST HOLLERED IN FOR HER TO LAY DOWN, AND THEN I WENT INTO THE BATHROOM, AND WHEN I"... ...I COME OUT, THE LIGHT WAS SHINING INTO HER BEDROOM. I COULD SEE SHE WAS WRAPPED UP IN A BLANKET, SO I WENT TO UNRAVEL IT. SO TIGHT... SHE WAS COLD. SHE WAS BLUE. "AND I TRIED -- I GAVE HER MOUTH-TO-MOUTH, BUT I COULDN'T SEE HER CHEST RISING, SO I WENT OUT AND STARTED TO CALL, AND I START DIALING, AND I -- AND THEN I PUT THE PHONE DOWN." WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT? NOW, SHE'S HAD 13 DAYS OF LIES AND DECEPTION, AND I THINK SHE REALIZED THINGS WERE CLOSING IN ON HER. I JUST DIDN'T WANT MY FAMILY TO THINK I WAS A BAD PERSON. I WAS TAKING SOME PHOTOGRAPHS. CHRISTINE LANE WAS THERE WITH A FEMALE FBI AGENT AND A ROAD-PATROL OFFICER. - YOU SURE IT WAS HERE? - YES, MA'AM. WHERE? SPEAK UP. HEY. UP THERE, IT'S JUST ABOUT 20 FEET. UNDER THEM BRANCHES. AND THEN WE UNCOVERED THE BODY BRANCH BY BRANCH, AND DURING THIS TIME, CHRISTINE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING AND DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. IT WAS JUST A VERY SOMBER MOMENT. SICKENING. DISGUSTING, SICKENING. YOU KNOW? YEAH. RAW DEAL FOR HIM. I FELT REALLY BAD FOR HIM. STILL DO. FIRST THING COME TO MIND IS, SHE MUST'VE DONE SOMETHING REALLY BAD TO LIE LIKE THAT AND TO LIE THAT GOOD. NOT A GENIUS OR NOTHING, BUT YOU HAVE TO GET PRETTIER THAN THE MORNING TO PULL ONE OVER ON ME HALF THE TIME, YOU KNOW? SO I WENT TO THE COUNTY LOCKUP TO SEE HER FINALLY, AND I SAID -- I SAID, "BUT JUST BETWEEN ME AND YOU, WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING?" SHE SAID SHE ALMOST TOLD ME A FEW TIMES A COUPLE TIMES AND STUFF, BUT SHE NEVER DID. YOU LIED TO ME. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. I JUST... "WHY? HOW COULD YOU DO THIS," YOU KNOW? SHE COULDN'T ANSWER IT. SHE JUST... SHE COULDN'T ANSWER IT. AND I SAID, "I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE ANSWER ANYHOW, SO I'M DONE WITH IT." I SAYS, "I HOPE THEY PUT YOU AWAY FOR A LONG TIME." I WALKED OUT. I WALKED OUT. FOR WEEKS, THE PEOPLE HAVE SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW FOR A LITTLE GIRL HOPED TO STILL BE ALIVE. THAT HOPE HAS NOW COME TO AN ABRUPT END, AS HAS THE LIFE OF A LITTLE GIRL THOUSANDS HOPELESSLY SEARCHED AND PRAYED FOR. THE FACT THAT SHE HAS LIED TO EVERYBODY, THAT SOMEONE COULD BE SO COLD AS TO DO THIS, CARRY ON THIS CHARADE, KNOWING FULL WELL IT WAS A LIE, IT JUST DISGUSTS ME. THEY HAD CHRIS SHACKLED -- EVERYTHING, HER ARMS, EVERYTHING -- AND SHE KNELT BY THE CASKET AND I WENT UP AND KNELT FOR A LITTLE WHILE WITH HER AND STUFF AND SHE WAS CRYING AND... AND SHE SAID... "WHY COULDN'T SHE JUST LAY DOWN THAT NIGHT AND GONE TO SLEEP, LITTLE..." - I STILL HAVE THE PHOTOGRAPH. - I KEPT IT FOR YEARS -- THIS LITTLE GIRL HERE. IT JUST... IT HIT ME SO HARD AT HOME IN MY HEART. WHEN YOU PRAY AND THE PRAYERS DON'T GO YOUR WAY, YOU THINK, "WHY SUCH A LITTLE GIRL? WHAT DID SHE DO TO DESERVE THIS?" THAT'S WHEN YOU QUESTION GOD. I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD DO THAT. I'M SORRY. THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. AND ALTHOUGH WE MOURN THE PASSING OF YOUNG ALIZA, WE MUST ALSO FIND SOLACE WITH THE LORD, OUR SAVIOR, KNOWING THAT ALIZA WILL -- CHRISTINE HAD REQUESTED PERMISSION TO GO TO THE FUNERAL, AND THAT WAS GRANTED BY THE JAIL SERGEANT. SHE WAS CRYING, AND... AND SHE SAID... "WHY COULDN'T SHE JUST LAY DOWN THAT NIGHT AND GONE TO SLEEP, LITTLE..." I THINK IT'S A DAMNING STATEMENT. THAT TELLS ME ALIZA WAS SUFFOCATED TO KEEP HER QUIET. THEN SHE REALIZED, "MY GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE?" ANY COMMENT? SHE'S WEARING A DRESS -- A FLOWERED DRESS WITH SOME LACE ON IT, AND I BELIEVE THAT'S AN ATTEMPT TO MAKE HER LOOK SO INNOCENT AND WHOLESOME AND NICE. LIKE A MOM... ...INSTEAD OF A MONSTER. "WHERE DID YOU COME FROM, BABY DEAR? I CAME FROM NOWHERE INTO HERE. WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE EYES OF BLUE? TOOK A PIECE OF HEAVEN WHEN I CAME THROUGH. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT GOLDEN HAIR? I STOLE SOME RAYS OF SUNSHINE FROM AWAY UP THERE. AND WHOM DO YOU LOVE THE BEST OF ALL? IT'S DIFFICULT TO ANSWER -- I LOVE YOU ALL." I GOT TWO DAUGHTERS -- BLOND HAIR, BLUE EYES. I WAS SAD, YEAH. PEOPLE WERE SAYING, "WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? WHY ALL THIS VIOLENT CRIME? WHY NOW? WHAT'S IN THE AIR?" PEOPLE FELT THEY WERE CURSED. THEY FELT SOMETHING OTHERWORLDLY WAS HAPPENING. PEOPLE MOVED. IT ALMOST FELT LIKE THE EVIL SPIRIT WAS FLOATING AROUND, JUST PICKING GREAT PEOPLE WHO DID NOTHING WRONG. WORKED AT DRYDEN FOOD MARKET, AND I LIVED IN DRYDEN FOR ABOUT, I DON'T KNOW, 30-SO YEARS? THERE'S JUST BEEN SO MANY TRAGEDIES IN DRYDEN. DRYDEN IS JUST OVERWHELMED WITH THEM. I USED TO HAVE WICKED NIGHTMARES ALL THE TIME. THE KNIFE. THE KNIFE HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN MY HEAD. I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT KNIFE. I DON'T LIKE MY BACK TO AN OPEN ROOM WHERE I CAN'T FEEL SOMEBODY COME UP BEHIND ME. SO A LOT HAS CHANGED FOR ME. I STARTED WORKING AT DRYDEN FOOD MART, AND COLLEEN WAS ALREADY WORKING THERE, AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, WE DID NOT HIT IT OFF TOGETHER IN THE BEGINNING. WE DIDN'T LIKE EACH OTHER, REALLY, TOO MUCH. COLLEEN WAS JUST A VERY STRONG, OVERBEARING PERSON TO TAKE. BUT THEN, YOU KNOW, THE MORE I GOT TO KNOW HER, THE BETTER THINGS GOT, AND WE JUST BECAME BEST FRIENDS -- INSEPARABLE. MY GOD. IT IS NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR YOU GUYS. WHEN I MET COLLEEN, HER AND PAUL WERE DATING. HE WAS A NICE GUY, YOU KNOW, AND I GOT ALONG GREAT WITH HIM. YOU'RE JUST BANKING ON THE WINNER. - SO I'M BANKING ON THE WINNER. - THERE'S NO HEART IN THAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK, KIRSTEN? I THINK YOU ACT LIKE YOU'RE ALREADY MARRIED. YEAH? - HEY, SCOTT. - HEY. HEY, SO, SETTLE SOMETHING FOR US. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? OKAY, SO, PAUL HERE DOESN'T THINK THE JETS ARE GONNA GO ALL THE WAY THIS YEAR. WELL, PAUL'S REALLY NEGATIVE, BUT, YOU KNOW, HE MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING. YEAH, THAT'S TRUE. ME AND SCOTT WENT TO THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL. WE WENT TO DRYDEN. HE WAS ALWAYS THE ONE THAT WAS FRIENDLY, ALWAYS SMILING, ALWAYS HAPPY. WE WOULD, YOU KNOW, HANG OUT, DRINK, YOU KNOW, DO ALL THE THINGS YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO. I THOUGHT WE WERE ALL JUST HAPPY FRIENDS, I MEAN... YOU'RE NOT FUNNY. THAT'S WHAT SHE SAYS. I THINK EVERYONE'S FUNNY. - YEAH. - IN THEIR OWN WAY. THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF ANYTHING THAT WAS COMING -- NO SIGNS, REALLY. WAIT, I CAN'T CLIMB IN THESE SHOES. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. COME ON. THERE, OKAY? PAUL STARTED BEING QUIET. RIGHT? IT'S A ROOF. HE KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING ON. HERE YOU GO. YOU KNOW WHEN SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT, YOU CAN FEEL IT, EVEN IF SOMEONE WON'T ADMIT IT TO YOU. I COULD TELL THAT SHE WAS FEELING SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR SCOTT, YOU KNOW, OTHER THAN JUST THE FRIENDSHIP. EXHIBIT "A." EXHIBIT "B." WHERE'D YOU GET THAT? I STOLE THEM FROM A DRIVING RANGE, ALL RIGHT? YOU READY? - I AM. MY GOD. WAIT, WAIT, LET ME TRY. OKAY. HERE. YEAH, YOU COULD TELL, THE WAY SHE WOULD SMILE AT HIM OR HE WOULD SMILE AT HER. I THINK IT WAS JUST A CHANGE. SOMETHING WAS COMING. COME ON. THERE'S AN OLD ABANDONED CHURCH, AND I CAN REMEMBERING GOING OVER THERE AND SITTING ON THE STEPS AND TALKING. I THINK SHE JUST WAS STARTING TO BE UNHAPPY, YOU KNOW? AND BEING THE FRIEND I WAS, I TOLD HER, YOU KNOW, "YOU'RE NOT HAPPY, YOU SHOULD GET OUT, 'CAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING." SHE WANTED SCOTT, THEN FINE, GO FOR SCOTT. I THINK I WAS JUST THAT SOUNDING VOICE THAT, IN HER HEAD, THAT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN. AND I THINK THAT WAS JUST ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE... EVERYTHING JUST KIND OF EXPLODED. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA HAPPEN. BEING A SMALL TOWN, SCOTT DIDN'T LOCK THE DOOR. DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW? WHO WOULD? I MEAN, I... JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS WATCHING. I DRIVE PAST THE APARTMENT BUILDING AT LEAST TWICE A DAY, 'CAUSE I LIVE JUST BEYOND IT. AND SOMETIMES I'D LIKE TO SEE IT TORN DOWN, BUT TO DRIVE PAST IT AND JUST ALL OF A SUDDEN START REMEMBERING WHAT TAKES PLACE THERE... I DON'T GO TO MY CLASS REUNIONS, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. I DON'T EVER WANT TO FORGET, BUT I DON'T WANT TO KEEP LIVING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN EITHER, YOU KNOW? I CAN REMEMBER ONE NIGHT, AS MEETING COLLEEN AT THE DRYDEN HOTEL -- IT'S A LOCAL BAR -- AND I CAN REMEMBER I WALKED IN AND PAUL WAS SITTING THERE. HONEY, YOU GOT TO GO HOME. LET ME CALL SOMEBODY FOR YOU. NO. AND HE JUST LOOKED SO SAD AND SO PATHETIC, AND I JUST FELT SO BAD. - SHOULD WE GO? - YEAH. YOU KNOW, WE LEFT 'CAUSE HE WAS THERE. YOU KNOW, SHE WAS MY FRIEND MORE THAN HE WAS, AND I WAS GONNA TAKE HER SIDE NO MATTER WHAT, SO... THE APARTMENT CAME UP AND I SAID... I WAS, LIKE, "I'M REALLY EX-- " IT WAS MY FIRST APARTMENT. I WAS REALLY EXCITED. AND SHE GOES, "WHY DON'T I JUST STAY WITH YOU IF THAT'S OKAY?" BRAND-SPANKING-NEW APARTMENT. BRAND-SPANKING-NEW LIFE WE WERE -- THAT WE WERE GOING TO START, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, HE CALLS ME EVERY DAY AND BEGS ME TO COME BACK TO HIM. DON'T DO IT. AND HE WAS HURT. HE WAS REALLY HURT. I MEAN... WE'VE ALL HAD OUR HEART BROKEN, SO WE, YOU KNOW -- AND I FELT BAD FOR HIM. I MEAN, YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. YEAH. I JUST... YEAH. HE'LL BE FINE. COME ON, IT'S PERFECT. YOU, ME, NEW APARTMENT, A NEW LIFE. NEW LIFE. AUGUST 14th WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY. WE HAD JUST HAD PLANS AND... THEY JUST NEVER HAPPENED. SCOTT CAME IN AND HE SAID IT WAS A LONG NIGHT, LET'S JUST GET A LITTLE BIT MORE SLEEP, YOU KNOW, AND WE'LL GET UP AND WE'LL GET GOING LATER." YOU KNOW, BEING A SMALL TOWN, SCOTT DIDN'T LOCK THE DOOR. HE -- HE DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, YOU KNOW? WHO WOULD? AND THEN... I MEAN, THAT WAS THE LAST THING I REMEMBER, YOU KNOW, BEFORE IT ALL HAPPENED. NEXT THING I REMEMBER IS PAUL THERE. I WOKE UP JUST TO SEEING HIM... FINISH STABBING HIM. THAT'S WHAT I WOKE UP TO. HE WAS PULLING THE KNIFE BACK... BACK OUT. IT WAS A BIG KNIFE. I JUST REMEMBER SEEING IN SLOW MOTION, AND... IT WAS JUST -- IT WAS HORRIBLE. I COULD SEE HIS EYES. HIS EYES JUST FREAKED ME OUT. I MEAN, I JUST COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS WATCHING. MY GOD, SCOTT. MY GOD. GOD, GOD. - WHAT HAPPENED?! MY GOD. - CALL AN AMBULANCE. MY GOD! WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? YOU...CAN'T... NEED TO CALL... WHAT?! MY GOD! I HONESTLY THINK SCOTT KNEW THAT IT WASN'T GOOD. DEEP DOWN, IN MY HEART, I THINK SCOTT KNEW THAT THERE REALLY WASN'T MUCH LEFT. I REALLY DO. THE LAST THING SCOTT SAID TO ME IS HE HAD TO GIVE ME THE PHONE NUMBER SO I COULD CALL THE AMBULANCE TO GET HIM HELP. THAT WAS THE LAST THING HE SAID. GOD! NO, NO, NO, NO, NO... I HAD STABBED HIM IN THE HEART. KIRSTEN HAD BEEN WAKING UP AT THE TIME, AND -- AND I LOOKED AT HER. I REMEMBER HER TENSING AND LOOKING AT ME WONDERING IF I WAS GONNA STAB HER, AND I HAD A BRIEF THOUGHT. OF STABBING HER, YEAH. ON THE NEXT EPISODE OF "VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED"... KIRSTEN HAD BEEN WAKING UP AT THE TIME, AND --  AND I LOOKED AT HER. I REMEMBER HER TENSING AND LOOKING AT ME WONDERING IF I WAS GONNA STAB HER. I DON'T THINK HE DESERVES TO BREATHE, I'M SORRY. I DON'T -- I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO STAY ON THIS PLANET. SHORTLY AFTER THAT, THERE WAS A HORRENDOUS CRIME INVOLVING DRYDEN HIGH SCHOOL. I FEEL THERE WAS SOME TYPE OF DARKNESS HE WAS TRYING TO HIDE AND THAT KEPT CREEPING FORWARD. HE HID HIS OBSESSION UNTIL THE LAST DAY.
