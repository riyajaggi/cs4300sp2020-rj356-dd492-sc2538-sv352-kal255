 I Dream of Jeannie (1965–1970): Season 3, Episode 6 - Jeannie, the Hip Hippie - full transcript 
 Tony prepares to go on a camping trip with Jeannie. Unfortunately, Doctor Bellows, who also was due to go on vacation, is forced to cancel because he must find a musical group to perform at a charity bazaar that Amanda is in charge of and because of this he forces Tony to cancel his vacation as well and orders him to help him find a group. Not wanting Tony to miss his vacation, Jeannie helps him by getting four non-musicians, including a couple of guys named Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart, and turning them into musicians. In fact, Jeannie is so successful in turning them into a group that they wind up getting an audition with Phil Spector.

 Yeah... Well, I've waited three years for this vacation. I'm a little rusty with this thing. Rusty? Mmm. And how would I look if I came home without a fish? Oh, you do not have to worry about that, master. Oh, yeah? What? [BOTH LAUGHING] Whoa! Ho, ho, ho, ho. [GIGGLES] That's a... A fake fish. Practice. [♪] [HUMMING]

 Alfred, what are you doing? Oh, I'm, uh, packing these books. Uh, I'm bringing them on our vacation. Well, you might as well unpack them. Unpack them? We're not going. Not going? Who says we're not going? The Rolling Waves. Oh, Amanda, what are you talking about? Darling, the Rolling Waves were all set to sing at my charity bazaar, and now they've canceled out. Well, why would they do that? Because they were mobbed in Indiana, and one of them is in the hospital. Oh, I hope it's nothing serious. Nothing serious? Alfred, I have to find another group to replace them, darling. And that's why we can't go on our vacation. Amanda. Do you mean to tell me, that I have to cancel my vacation, that I've waited for for five years because a Rolling Wave was mobbed in Indiana? I'm sorry, dear. Yes. Well, you can't be serious. Darling, now look. I'm the chairman of the entertainment committee, correct? Yes. And I discovered the Rolling Waves. Well then, darling, it's up to me to find another group to replace them. How long will that take? I don't know, dear. I'm working on it now. [SIGHS] Amanda, the general knows I'm going on my vacation. All the boys at the officers' club know I'm going on my vacation. I'm sorry, dear. Oh, well. I'll try to find some excuse. Oh, Amanda. Don't let anyone know that I've cancelled my vacation because of the... Rolling Waves. Oh, I'm sorry, dear. But after all, darling... that's show business. Major Nelson. Oh. Would you mind telling me what you're doing? Sir, I'm... I'm just practicing. I'm... I'm going on my vacation tomorrow. Well, I wouldn't count on it if I were you. Why not, sir? Well, we're gonna postpone your vacation. Postpone it? But I've been waiting for three years for this vacation, sir. I know some people who've waited five years for their vacation. I'm sorry, major, but we're expediting your tests for the lunar project. We're starting tomorrow. Tomorrow? Yes, I'm afraid so. Well, how long are the tests gonna last, sir? I have no idea. Major, that's show business. Major. Sir. If you don't... Well, thank you. Master, I'm home. Well, I... What? Hello? Look what I bought. How do you like it? Oh, brother. What are you doing? I'm trying to get a little use out of this equipment, before I have to send it back. [DOORBELL RINGS] That's the guy who's probably coming to pick up his stuff. Oh, I'll get it. Ahh, Jeannie. Uh, there's something wrong in the kitchen with the tap. Would you check it please? Oh, yes, master. Oh, boy. Yes? Oh, hello, major. Oh, pardon me for barging in like this. Oh, isn't this cute. You're camping out in your living room. Well, that's adorable. You know, I try to get Alfred to do things like this, but he's just too conservative. Yeah. I'm just, uh, trying out some equipment that I'm not gonna be able to use. Oh... You're going on a vacation, huh? Well, it's been postponed. AMANDA: Isn't that a coincidence. You know, Alfred's vacation's been postponed too. TONY: Oh, really? You see, since I've lost the Rolling Waves, I can't go. So, I mean, naturally if I can't go, Alfred can't go either. Oh, naturally. Obviously. AMANDA: So that's why I'm here, major. You see, since I've lost the Rolling Waves, I have to find another musical group to replace them. And I thought... [CHUCKLES] Maybe you could help me find a musical group. I really don't know anything about singing. I'll tell you what we need. We need a group... that's hip. Hip? Yes. You listen to the radio, don't you? Well, I... Wasn't going to take this on vacation with me. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS OVER RADIO] That. That's what we need. Why? Well, major, because that is the kind of music that draws crowds. Don't you understand? See, I'm in charge of this whole thing. It was all my idea. I... I've got to get another group to replace them. I'm not gonna leave town until I get a group that is gonna kill them. Oh, I see. If I can help you find a group, then you and Dr. Bellows can go on your vacation. Exactly, exactly. That's it. Yes, yes. Oh, major. Huh? Oh, sorry. Yes. But you listen to me. It is very important that Alfred not know that I asked you for any help. Oh, don't worry about a thing. I'd be the last one to tell him. Thank you very much, major. Now, listen, if you hear of anything at all. You know, if you think of any, you will let me know. Yes, I certainly will. I mean, it'd be such a shame to... waste all that marvelous equipment. I know. I-I... Bye. Master. Oh, master, you will never guess what? I've just figured it out. Do you know why Dr. Bellows canceled your vacation? Yeah. So do you. You've been listening in the kitchen. Well, why are you unhappy? Jeannie, do you have any idea? How hard do you think it'd be to find a better group than this? [CHUCKLES] They remind me of a group that Caligula had beheaded. Well, you could pick up better singers on any street corner. You could? Oh, well, then I think I can solve your problem, master. Huh? You mean you know a group? Well, I... I do not know a group but I... I think I know where I can find one. Yeah? How long would it take you to get them? Can you give me 10 minutes? Sure. That's my girl. [♪] Ah, there we are. Where are we? I don't feel so good. Oh, you will. Oh, dear. Someone is missing. [DOORBELL RINGS] Ah. Ha! I'm here to pick up the camping equipment. Oh, I know. Now, we are ready. Ready for what? I can hardly wait to hear you sing. I'm sorry lady, but I don't sing. Neither do I. Oh. Well, I thought everyone sang. Jeannie, did the guy come to pick up... Oh. Hey, this is the group. This is your vacation, master. We can leave at any time. [LAUGHING] No kidding. We... Uh, go ahead, go ahead. Go ahead and what? Well, you know. I mean, go ahead... Sing or whatever you... Master, they... They have not rehearsed yet. Huh? Oh, uh, listen. Don't let me disturb you now. I'll put this in the kitchen, I'll be right back. You guys go and rehearse. I'm getting out of here. Ah, ah, ahh. You must not leave until Major Nelson has heard you sing. All right, now. Ready? A one, and a two, and a three, and a four and...

TONY: Hey, Jeannie, you're wonderful. Be ready to leave tomorrow morning. Lady, would you mind telling me what's going on? Certainly. You are all going to sing at a charity bazaar. I'm getting out of here. But, sir, Tony's been looking forward to this vacation for a long time. No, Major Healey. I'm not going on my vacation, Major Nelson's not going on his vacation. We're gonna do these tests and that's final. Oh, morning, sir. Good morning. I'm ready to go to work. Yes, I see you are. It'll take us about six weeks to get through all this stuff. Yes. [WHISTLING] What are you so happy about, major? Oh, uh, good music always does that to me, sir. I just heard a new singing group. [CHUCKLING] They're fantastic. This new singing group? Yes, sir. Uh, Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart. They're really great. Well, shall we go to work on this? You mean they're here? Yes. In Cocoa Beach? Yes. Oh, there's the new inversion chart I've been looking for. I knew you had that in here... Are they available? Who? The singing group? Oh, yes, yes. I imagine so. Uh, you see the PCH starts... Major, will you stop changing the subject? Well, I thought this was the subject, sir. Where can I get hold of them? I believe they're on their way over to your house. Now, you don't think Dr. Bellows is going to let you go on vacation, do you? Yeah, I know he is. Well he's not, because I talked to him. He's got experiments worked out so it's gonna take about the next 50 years. No, I'm leaving in the morning. Oh, no you're not. Yeah. Oh, you wanna bet? You wanna bet? How about $100? I don't want your money. I really don't. Come on, a hundred dollars says you're not. I'll bet you a dollar. $100. Five. $100. Roger, $100... A hundred. You're on. Now, wait a minute... A hundred dollars. You're on. There you are, Major Nelson. You've been looking for me, sir? I've been thinking things over. You've been working terribly hard, but, uh... That's what we're here for, sir. I realize that it's been three years since you've had a vacation... That's quite all right, sir. I'm prepared to go ahead with the tests. No, major. I won't let you make that sacrifice. It so happens, I'm taking a little vacation myself, starting tomorrow morning. You can take your vacation as well. Oh, well, that's different of course. That's... That's quite different. You can start leaving tomorrow morning. Have a good time. Well, thank you very much, sir. Thank you. You're uh, not gonna take the money, are you? You wouldn't take it, would you? Because it was just... You said five and I said 100, but you said one. No. Take it all. What is this for? Jeannie, we're going camping. Why do you keep putting these things in my way? You know, tomorrow afternoon I'm going to take them to see Phil Spector. Good, good. He handles the biggest musical acts in the country. Uh, tomorrow afternoon we're not gonna be here. We are not? No, we're going on our vacation, remember? Oh. Well, I am afraid we will have to cancel that. Cancel? Mm. Yes, master. Ohh. Well, that is show business. Are you... Are you trying to tell me, Jeannie, that I'm gonna have to cancel my vacation because of those four, uh, what's their names? The Boyce & Hart Group. Yeah. You telling me that? Oh, yes, master. They need me. Is it not strange they were not even interested in show business until the bazaar. Jeannie, music is very well, in it's place it's great. And when we come back from our vacation, you can listen to the... Oh, no, master. We must strike while the iron is hot. Where'd you hear that? Aristotle said it. [CHUCKLING] You know... You know how you worry about me? Yes, master. [LAUGHS] Well, you have reason to. Jeannie, I've been looking forward to this vacation for a long time. Going to the great outdoors. Under the stars, under the trees with maybe a fire in front of the tent. And a tinkling little stream in the distance. I need a rest. A R-E-S-T. Yes, master. Yes. Oh, good evening, Major Nelson, I hope we're not disturbing you. It's my fault anyway, major. I insisted that we come by and thank you personally. Yes. Come in. Thank you. You're camping in your living room. Yeah, it's sort of a rehearsal, sir. With trees? BELLOWS: And a babbling brook? I wanted to get the feel of it. I think it's marvelous. Oh, Alfred, why don't we ever do something like this? Amanda, I spend half my life curing people who do things like this. I see you even have a fire going. Yes, sir. Got chilly in here. I think we'll be running along. Oh, yes. But, major, listen, I want to thank you again. You don't know what that group did for me. I can't tell you what they did for me. I wouldn't wait until tomorrow to go on your vacation if I were you. I'd leave now. Trees. Tent, fire and... babbling brook. Hey, baby. How you doing? Yeah, look, I just played your new song. Well, let me see. The bridge is very weak. Well, the tempo's awful. The lyric? Stinks. I think you got another smash. Congratulations. Look, I'm ordering 100,000 records, and that's just the beginning. Uh, look, I'll talk to you later. How did you get in here? Excuse me, are you Mr. Phil Spector? Look, it's been a real bad day. Would you come back in April? Are you not looking for singers? [RINGS] You'll have to make an appointment. Uh, hello? No. No, you have to go to Nashville, and bring the group back yourself. I'm telling you, it's the greatest group I ever heard in years. Of course you have to bring their mother with them, they're only nine years old. What? Are you still here? What is this, a convention? Where is Bill? I don't know. Helen, will you please get these people out of my office... Oh, dear. Well...

Y-you're really going, huh? Yep. Oh, you're gonna have a ball. Boy, I really envy you. Uh, remember me when you're spending my money. Will do. Uh, where's Jeannie? She isn't going. She isn't...? What do you mean... Well, what happened? I'll tell you what happened. She's more interested in four, absolute strangers than she is in me. Who are the strangers? Oh, their names are Boyce & Hart. Oh, you mean the guys at the bazaar? Yeah. Oh, they were brilliant. I mean, really. I mean, they were the... They were average... Below average group. Well, let her stay. Who needs her anyway? Yeah, yeah, who needs her anyway. It'll be great being away from her for two or three weeks. Oh! Yeah, great. You'll have a ball. Yeah, just... Just have a ball. No one to get me in trouble every time I turn around. Yeah, no one to cook for you. No one to try to run my life for me. No one to take care of you. Yeah. Really looking forward to this, Roge. I'm gonna have a terrible time. You want me to help you put them in there? Well, why don't you just cancel the whole thing? What do you mean ca...? I can't cancel. It'd give her the upper hand for the rest of my life. Yeah, well, what's she got now? Besides, it's the principle of the thing. I got 300 dollars tied up in that equipment. Well, think of it this way. It only cost you 200 dollars. JEANNIE: Master! Hey, what do you mean? There's Jeannie now. JEANNIE: Master! I knew she'd come back. I never doubted it for a minute. Master! Oh! Oh. I looked all over for you. Oh, well, I was, uh, just leaving, Jeannie. Oh, but I could not let you leave without me. Couldn't you? Oh, no, I would miss you so very much. Well, let this be a lesson to you. How long would it take you to pack? Oh, not long. Oh! Well... You sure you didn't forget anything? I do not think so. So long, Roge. Yeah. Well, have a good time, and, uh, write me something in Jeannie, huh? We will. Now, I have our route all marked out. First, we stop in Chicago. Um, Jeannie, we're going to Little Bear Lake. Oh, did I not tell you? We are going on tour. After Chicago, we stop in Minneapolis, Detroit and Montreal. ♪ Bom, bom bom bom bom Bom-bom, bom-bom ♪ ♪ Out and about ♪ ♪ Bom, bom bom bom bom Bom-bom, bom-bom ♪ ♪ Out and about ♪ ♪ Bah buh-dum-dum... ♪ [♪] [♪]
