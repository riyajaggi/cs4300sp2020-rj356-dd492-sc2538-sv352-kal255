 Wicked Attraction (2008–…): Season 1, Episode 4 - Evil in the Desert - full transcript 
 From July of 1996 until March of 1999, a number of young women go missing in and around the twin towns of Truth or Consequences and Elephant Butte, New Mexico. Not all of them are seen again. The ones who are, find themselves plagued by nightmarish visions, lost memories, and horrifying tales of torture and unspeakable acts. When a naked woman wearing a dog collar and a chain escapes from the home of a sadistic couple, she leads authorities to a chamber of horrors disturbingly referred to as "The Toy Box".

 ON THE AFTERNOON OF APRIL 3, 1985... ...POLICE IN BEDFORD COUNTY, VIRGINIA, RECEIVE A FRANTIC CALL. ALL RIGHT. I'LL GET A DEPUTY OUT THERE, OKAY? A WOMAN REPORTS SHE FOUND HER FRIENDS, DEREK AND NANCY HAYSOM, DEAD. I HAD BEEN WORKING SOME BURGLARIES WHEN I HEARD THE TRAFFIC ON THE RADIO. THEY HAD ASKED THE INVESTIGATORS TO RESPOND TO HOLCOMB ROCK ROAD, AT WHICH TIME I STILL DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE HAD. WHEN I FIRST WALKED IN,

 I-I WASN'T NECESSARILY PREPARED FOR WHAT I WAS ABOUT TO SEE. MR. HAYSOM WAS LAYING ON HIS BACK, INSIDE THE FRONT DOOR. THERE WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF DRIED BLOOD SURROUNDED HIS BODY. HAD A LOT OF DAMAGE TO HIS THROAT. WALKED INTO THE KITCHEN, AND NANCY WAS LAYING ON THE FLOOR THERE IN A POOL OF BLOOD. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN IT. IT WAS JUST DEVASTATING TO GO IN AND SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AT THAT POINT, OF COURSE, YOUR MIND STARTS JUST GOING IN CIRCLES, YOU KNOW? "WHAT IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE HAPPENED HERE?" THIS CRIME SCENE WAS... WAS SHOCKING. INVESTIGATORS DETERMINED THAT 72-YEAR-OLD DEREK HAYSOM AND HIS WIFE, 53-YEAR-OLD NANCY,

 DIED OF MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS AND HAD THEIR THROATS SLASHED. BOTH OF THEM HAD SOME DEFENSIVE WOUNDS ON THEIR HANDS. HE IN PARTICULAR HAD WOUNDS ON THE PALM OF HIS HAND, WHERE HE, IN FACT, MUST HAVE GRABBED THE KNIFE BLADE. FROM THE TEXTURE AND COLOR OF THE BLOOD, THE VICTIMS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR SEVERAL DAYS. WE WERE ABLE, INITIALLY, TO RULE OUT A BURGLARY AND/OR ROBBERY OF THE HAYSOM'S HOUSE BECAUSE WE DID FIND HER POCKETBOOK WITH MONEY INSIDE OF IT. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY AT ALL FROM THE WINDOWS, FRONT DOOR. IN THE DINING ROOM, POLICE NOTE THREE CHAIRS PULLED OUT FROM THE TABLE, BUT ONLY TWO PLACE SETTINGS. IT SUGGESTS THE HAYSOMS KNEW THEIR KILLER AND INVITED HIM IN AS THEY FINISHED DINNER. THE MOTIVE APPEARS TO BE PERSONAL. TO ME, IT WAS JUST A... JUST OVERKILL. JUST A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF HATRED THAT THE PERSON MUST HAVE FELT TOWARDS THESE TWO PEOPLE. IT WAS SO HORRIFIC, IT LOOKED LIKE THE INSIDE OF A SLAUGHTERHOUSE. INVESTIGATORS FIND THAT THE KILLER TRIED TO DESTROY EVIDENCE. THEY SMEARED THE BLOOD AROUND AND WIPED AROUND THE BODIES TO TRY AND HIDE THE FOOTPRINTS, BUT THEY OVERLOOKED A FEW. WE HAD A BLOODY FOOTPRINT. SOMEONE HAD A SOCK ON, HAD THEIR SHOES OFF. BOTH VICTIMS WEAR SHOES. SO THE FOOTPRINT MUST BE THE KILLER'S. THAT WAS PHOTOGRAPHED MULTIPLE TIMES. WE ALSO SAWED THE FLOOR UP AND SUBMITTED THAT TO THE LAB. POLICE ALSO FIND BLOOD ON THE SCREEN-DOOR HANDLE AND IN THE UPSTAIRS BATHROOM. IT'S A DIFFERENT BLOOD TYPE THAN THE VICTIMS', SUGGESTING THE KILLER LIKELY CUT HIMSELF. INVESTIGATORS ATTEMPT TO LOCATE THE MURDER WEAPON. IT WAS OBVIOUS IT WAS A KNIFE. WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TYPE KNIFE. WE WALKED ALL THE WAY TO ROUTE 501, LOOKING BESIDE DITCHES FOR ANY WEAPONS OR ANYTHING THAT MAY HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT OF THE SUSPECT VEHICLE. WE DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING. AFTER COMBING THROUGH THE HOUSE FOR MORE THAN A WEEK, TECHNICIANS CAN FIND NO CLUES TO CONNECT TO THE KILLER. INVESTIGATORS INTERVIEW NEIGHBORS, HOPING FOR A LEAD OR A MOTIVE. NO ONE HAD SEEN ANYTHING OR HEARD ANYTHING. SO THAT DIDN'T HELP US. INVESTIGATORS LEARN THAT DEREK AND NANCY WERE A WELL-LIKED, FRIENDLY COUPLE. DEREK AND NANCY HAYSOM WERE TWO VERY SOPHISTICATED, WORLD-TRAVELED PEOPLE. THEY HAD BEEN AROUND THE WORLD QUITE A BIT. THEY MET IN SOUTH AFRICA, AND THEY LATER LIVED IN RHODESIA. EACH HAD BEEN MARRIED PREVIOUSLY AND HAD 5 CHILDREN BETWEEN THEM WHEN THEY MET IN 1957. THEY MARRIED IN 1960 AND HAD ANOTHER DAUGHTER, ELIZABETH, IN 1964. DEREK'S WORK IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY TOOK HIS FAMILY ALL OVER THE WORLD. DEREK AND NANCY EVENTUALLY RETIRED IN BEDFORD COUNTRY, VIRGINIA, IN 1981, WHEN ELIZABETH WAS 16 YEARS OLD. NOW 20, ELIZABETH ATTENDS THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA IN NEARBY CHARLOTTESVILLE. ON APRIL 7th, SHE AND THE REST OF THE HAYSOMS' CHILDREN ATTEND THEIR PARENTS' MEMORIAL SERVICE. INVESTIGATORS QUESTION THEM INDIVIDUALLY ABOUT THE MURDER. FOUR OF THE HAYSOMS' CHILDREN LIVE IN CANADA. HOWARD, NANCY HAYSOM'S SON FROM A PREVIOUS MARRIAGE, LIVES IN TEXAS AND IS THE MOST COOPERATIVE WITH AUTHORITIES. HOWARD TELLS INVESTIGATORS THAT HIS PARENTS WERE KIND PEOPLE, AND HE CANNOT THINK OF ANYONE WHO WOULD WANT TO DO THEM HARM. LATER THAT DAY, THE HAYSOMS' YOUNGEST DAUGHTER, ELIZABETH, ARRIVES FOR HER INTERVIEW. SINCE SHE LIVES CLOSE BY, REID AND GARDNER WANT TO ESTABLISH HER WHEREABOUTS THE WEEKEND HER PARENTS WERE KILLED. SHE TOLD US THEN THAT SHE AND HER BOYFRIEND HAD RENTED A CAR IN CHARLOTTESVILLE AND HAD DRIVEN TO WASHINGTON, D.C., THAT WEEKEND AND THEN RETURNED BACK TO CHARLOTTESVILLE ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. SHE ALSO TELLS POLICE THAT THE LAST TIME SHE SAW HER PARENTS WAS A WEEK BEFORE THE MURDERS, AND EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE. SHE TOLD US THAT SHE LOVED HER PARENTS VERY MUCH AND THAT THEY HAD ALWAYS TRIED TO DO THE BEST FOR HER, WHICH INCLUDED SENDING HER TO THE BEST SCHOOLS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE GOT A PROPER EDUCATION. INVESTIGATORS ASK ELIZABETH IF SHE KNOWS ANYONE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN ANGRY WITH HER PARENTS. ELIZABETH STATED THAT HER BROTHER JULIAN'S FIANCéE WAS A POSSIBLE SUSPECT. JANE WAS VERY UPSET WITH DEREK AND NANCY HAYSOM BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT BECAUSE OF THEM, HER AND JULIAN'S RELATIONSHIP BROKE UP. JANE LIVES IN LYNCHBURG, ONLY A FEW MILES FROM THE VICTIMS. INVESTIGATORS BRING HER IN FOR QUESTIONING. JANE HAS AN ALIBI FOR THAT WEEKEND, BUT HER PAST RAISES RED FLAGS. WE FOUND OUT THAT JANE HAD SOME EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS. SUPPOSEDLY, SHE HAD GOTTEN INVOLVED WITH A CULT GROUP IN RICHMOND. SHE HAD SUPPOSEDLY BEEN COMMITTED AT ONE TIME. INVESTIGATORS TAKE CRIME-SCENE PHOTOS TO THE RICHMOND POLICE DEPARTMENT'S CULT UNIT FOR THEIR INPUT. AND THEY GOT TO LOOKING AT THE PICTURES AND NOTICED SOME THINGS AND BROUGHT IT TO OUR ATTENTION, SUCH AS... DEREK HAD A "V" CUT IN HIS CHIN. THE TWO BODIES WERE LAYING ON THE FLOOR WITH THEIR HEAD FACING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION. THE WIPING UP OF THE BLOOD... THE WAY IT WAS WIPED AROUND THE BODY AND THE CONTOUR OF THE BODY, ACCORDING TO THEM, WAS A POSSIBLE CULT. THEN WE STARTED SAYING, "OKAY, MAYBE THEY'RE RIGHT. MAYBE IT IS A CULT KILLING." IF THE HAYSOM MURDERS ARE THE WORK OF A RITUALISTIC CULT, THERE IS NO TELLING WHO COULD BE NEXT. POLICE IN BEDFORD COUNTY, VIRGINIA, FEAR A SATANIC CULT MIGHT BE BEHIND THE DOUBLE HOMICIDE OF NANCY AND DEREK HAYSOM. IF THE MURDERS ARE A RITUALISTIC KILLING, THEN EVERYONE IS IN DANGER. THE COMMUNITY WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CULT ACTIVITY. EVERY TIME THEY LEFT THEIR HOUSE OR THEY WAS OUT IN THEIR YARD, THEY LOCKED THEIR DOORS. THEY WERE TERRIFIED. OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS, THEY TRACK EVERY POSSIBLE LEAD, BUT THEY CAN'T LINK ANY CULT GROUP TO THE MURDERS. INVESTIGATORS REINTERVIEW THEIR KEY SUSPECT... JANE. I HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH HER. SHE WAS THE TYPE PERSON THAT WOULD BABBLE ON FOR A WHILE, AND YOU'D GET A LITTLE IRRITATED. EVEN THOUGH SHE HAD EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS, SHE HAD SOME SMARTS ABOUT HER. YOU JUST HAD TO TAKE TIME TO LISTEN TO HER. WHEN SHE REALIZES SHE'S THE MAIN SUSPECT, SHE OFFERS TO TAKE A POLYGRAPH TEST. HER THING WAS THAT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A SUSPECT AND SHE WANTED TO PROVE HER INNOCENCE. AFTER PASSING THE POLYGRAPH, JANE TELLS AUTHORITIES WHO SHE THINKS KILLED THE HAYSOMS. JANE FLAT SAID THAT ELIZABETH DID IT. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE TOLD US. SHE FELT LIKE ELIZABETH WAS A VERY EVIL PERSON. JANE SAYS DEREK HAYSOM DIDN'T LIKE ELIZABETH'S NEW BOYFRIEND. JANE TELLS US THAT THE NIGHT OF THE MEMORIAL SERVICE THAT SHE WAS IN THE KITCHEN AND ELIZABETH HAD WALKED IN, AND IT WAS JUST THE TWO OF THEM IN THE KITCHEN. AND OUT OF THE BLUE, ELIZABETH LOOKS AT JANE AND SAYS, "I'M THE DEVIL, AND YOU'RE THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB." SO, BASICALLY SAYING, YOU KNOW, "I DID IT, BUT YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR IT." INVESTIGATORS FOLLOW UP ON JANE'S CLAIMS. THEY CALL HOWARD HAYSOM IN HOUSTON AND ASK HIM ABOUT ELIZABETH. HOWARD STATES THAT SINCE THE MEMORIAL SERVICE, HE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY CONVINCED SHE WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED. THERE WAS A LOT OF LITTLE THINGS HOWARD NOTICED, AND THE BIGGEST THING WAS THE FACT OF HAVING NO EMOTION. I MEAN, IT'S JUST UNREAL. THE NORMAL PERSON... IT DOESN'T HAPPEN THAT WAY. HOWARD ADDS THAT HIS STEPFATHER DISAPPROVED OF ELIZABETH'S NEW BOYFRIEND, JENS SOERING. AUTHORITIES DECIDE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT ELIZABETH HAYSOM AND JENS SOERING. THE YOUNGEST HAYSOM SIBLING, ELIZABETH SPENT MOST OF HER LIFE LIVING ABROAD, MOVING FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY AS HER FATHER RELOCATED FOR WORK. SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY WORLDLY, VERY EDUCATED, VERY ARTICULATE, HAD THE EUROPEAN ACCENT. SHE TOLD US ABOUT HER TRAVELS AND HER PARENTS' TRAVELS AND THE FACT THAT SHE HAD ATTENDED A BOARDING SCHOOL IN ENGLAND. LIKE ELIZABETH, JENS SOERING SPENT MOST OF HIS LIFE OVERSEAS, MOVING TO THE U.S. WHEN HE WAS 11 YEARS OLD. ELIZABETH AND JENS MEET AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. ELIZABETH IS 20, AND JENS IS 18. THEY ARE BOTH FRESHMEN AT THE UNIVERSITY, AND THEY'RE BOTH VERY BRIGHT. SO BOTH ARE THERE ON SCHOLARSHIPS. JENS IS A VERY IMMATURE 18-YEAR-OLD WHO GREW UP IN A SHELTERED ENVIRONMENT. HE'S WHAT YOU WOULD CALL TODAY A GEEK. HE HAS VIRTUALLY NO PERSONALITY. HE'S NOT ATTRACTIVE. AND HE WEARS THICK, HORN-RIMMED GLASSES. JENS WAS A LONER. HIS FATHER WAS A GERMAN DIPLOMAT. IN MY OPINION, HE LOOKED AT ELIZABETH... AS SOMEONE THAT HE COULD DEPEND ON, AS FAR AS CARING FOR HIM. JENS IS UNDENIABLY ATTRACTED TO ELIZABETH, WHO'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN AND VERY SOPHISTICATED. AND HE IS PUZZLED BY HER INTEREST IN HIM. BUT WHAT JENS DOESN'T KNOW IS THAT ELIZABETH IS AN EMOTIONAL POWDER KEG. ELIZABETH WAS SUFFERING FROM BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER. THEY'RE VERY IMPULSIVE. THEY HAVE POOR JUDGMENT. THEIR EMOTIONS ARE VERY ERRATIC AND UNPREDICTABLE AND APT TO QUICK CHANGES AND VERY INTENSE CHANGES, PARTICULARLY AROUND FEELINGS OF RAGE AND DESPERATION. THE OVERALL PICTURE OF HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER FAMILY WAS ONE OF ALMOST TOTAL EMOTIONAL CHAOS. SHE HAD NO SENSE OF POSITIVE EMOTIONAL ATTACHMENT TO EITHER PARENT. HER BASIC RECOLLECTIONS OF HER PARENTS WERE GIVING HER ORDERS, TELLING HER WHAT TO DO, AND BASICALLY JUST EXERTING ALMOST TOTAL CONTROL. A PERSON WITH BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER OFTEN TRIES TO SEIZE CONTROL IN OTHER WAYS. THEY MAY ENGAGE IN SELF-DESTRUCTIVE OR SELF-DEFEATING BEHAVIOR, WHETHER THAT'S GAMBLING OR DRINKING OR ABUSING DRUGS OR SOMETIMES SUICIDE ATTEMPTS THAT MAY BE MANIPULATIVE OR THEY MAY ACTUALLY CUT ON THEMSELVES, IN ORDER TO RELIEVE THE FEELING OF TENSION THAT'S INTERNAL TO THEM. ELIZABETH'S ANIMOSITY TOWARD HER PARENTS STEMS FROM A STRONG SENSE OF ABANDONMENT. ELIZABETH HAS ALWAYS HAD A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP WITH HER PARENTS, EVER SINCE THEY SENT HER AWAY TO BOARDING SCHOOL. EVENTUALLY, THIS RELATIONSHIP GREW MORE STRAINED BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT HER PARENTS REALLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HER. THEY JUST WANTED TO GET RID OF HER. I THINK BY THE TIME ELIZABETH GOT TO COLLEGE, SHE WAS EXTREMELY RESENTFUL AND EXTREMELY ANGRY TOWARD HER PARENTS. ELIZABETH REFUSES TO LET HER PARENTS RULE HER LIFE. ELIZABETH HAYSOM IS VERY INTELLIGENT, VERY DETERMINED, VERY STRONG-WILLED, AND SHE'S GONNA GET WHAT SHE WANTS NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES TO GET IT. SHE DOES THAT BY EXPLOITING OTHERS. THE BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDERED INDIVIDUAL, ALMOST WITHOUT FAIL, DEVELOPS A GREAT CAPACITY TO BE MANIPULATIVE. AND IN JENS SOERING, ELIZABETH FINDS HER PUPPET. ELIZABETH SEES SOMETHING IN JENS THAT TELLS HER, "THIS IS THE GUY WHO CAN GET ME WHAT I NEED." JENS IS NOT EXPERIENCED SEXUALLY. HE'S PROBABLY NEVER EVEN KISSED A GIRL. JENS IS VERY ATTRACTED TO ELIZABETH BECAUSE OF THE SEXUALITY THAT SHE EXUDES. ELIZABETH IS MORE INTERESTED IN JENS ON AN INTELLECTUAL BASIS. BUT IF SHE HAS TO USE SEX TO GET WHAT SHE WANTS, SHE WILL. BY JANUARY 1985, ELIZABETH AND JENS ARE DATING SERIOUSLY. THE COUPLE MESHED VERY WELL. JENS WAS ENTIRELY, ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH ELIZABETH, AND HE WOULD DO ANYTHING SHE SAID. WITH JENS ALL TO HERSELF, ELIZABETH CONTINUES THE MANIPULATION. NOW INSEPARABLE, WHEN THEY GO HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS, THEY WRITE TO EACH OTHER CONSTANTLY. IN HER LETTERS, ELIZABETH TELLS JENS ABOUT THE ABUSE SHE SUFFERS AT THE HANDS OF HER PARENTS AND HOW MUCH SHE HATES THEM. JENS LEARNS TO HATE THEM, TOO. JENS IS GUIDED BY SEX. IN EFFECT, ELIZABETH SAID, "I'LL GIVE YOU ALL THE SEX YOU WANT IF YOU JUST DO WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO." JENS WAS ENTIRELY SUBMISSIVE TO ANYTHING SHE WANTED. INVESTIGATORS IN BEDFORD COUNTY NOW HAVE TO WONDER IF JENS IS SO COMPLETELY UNDER ELIZABETH'S SPELL THAT HE WOULD EVEN HELP HER COMMIT MURDER. AUTHORITIES IN BEDFORD COUNTY, VIRGINIA, NOW SUSPECT ELIZABETH HAYSOM AND HER BOYFRIEND, JENS SOERING, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MURDER OF ELIZABETH'S PARENTS. WE LEARNED THROUGH THE INVESTIGATION THAT SHE HAD EXPERIMENTED WITH SOME PRETTY HARD DRUGS... HEROIN AND WHATNOT. SHE WOULD LEAVE HOME ANYTIME. ONE TIME, SHE LEFT AND TOOK OFF TO GERMANY, AND THE FAMILY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS AT. AND MR. AND MRS. HAYSOM FINALLY GOT INTERPOL INVOLVED AND BROUGHT HER BACK HOME. FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALS THAT ELIZABETH HAS NOT BEEN ENTIRELY TRUTHFUL WITH AUTHORITIES. TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. ELIZABETH WAS TELLING US THAT SHE HAD A GREAT FAMILY LIFE WITH HER PARENTS, GREAT RELATIONSHIP. BUT FROM TALKING TO SOME OF HER FRIENDS, WE WAS LEARNING DIFFERENT. I'M TIRED OF HEARING THIS. SHE HATED HER PARENTS. SO, WE WERE GETTING TWO STORIES THERE. ON THE SURFACE, ELIZABETH SEEMS VERY SUSPICIOUS, BUT INVESTIGATORS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT LIES BENEATH. VIOLENT THOUGHTS ARE COMMON AMONG BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDERED INDIVIDUALS. OFTENTIMES, THE VIOLENCE IS TOWARDS THEMSELF... ...WANTING TO DESTROY OR INJURE OR MAIM THEMSELVES. IT WOULD BE ALMOST INEVITABLE THAT SHE WOULD DEVELOP SOME FORM OF MENTAL DYSFUNCTION AND TURN HER ANGER AND HER FRUSTRATION TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS. ELIZABETH IS BRILLIANT, ANGRY, AND DAMAGED, BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE HER A MURDERER. DELVING DEEPER, INVESTIGATORS REVIEW ELIZABETH'S PRIOR STATEMENTS AND TEST HER ALIBI... THE WEEKEND TRIP SHE AND JENS TOOK TO WASHINGTON, D.C. WE CHECKED WITH THE RENTAL-CAR BUSINESS IN CHARLOTTESVILLE AND WAS ABLE TO GET THE ACTUAL RENTAL-CAR AGREEMENT. RIGHT OFF THE TOP, WE COULD SEE THAT THERE EXCESSIVE MILES ON THAT RENTAL CAR THAT WEEKEND. THEY PUT 429 EXTRA MILES ON THE VEHICLE GOING TO D.C. THE EXTRA MILEAGE IS ROUGHLY A ROUND TRIP FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., TO ELIZABETH'S PARENTS' HOUSE. I BROUGHT THAT TO HER ATTENTION THE SECOND TIME THAT I SPOKE WITH ELIZABETH. AND THAT'S WHEN SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE AND HE HAD GOTTEN LOST. YOU DON'T RIDE AROUND FOR SIX AND EIGHT HOURS LOST IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND NOT FIND YOUR WAY TO YOUR DESTINATION. IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. I'M NO ROCKET SCIENTIST, BUT I KNOW IF I'M LOST FOR 15 TO 20 MINUTES, I'M GONNA STOP AND ASK SOMEBODY, YOU KNOW, HOW TO GET OUT OF HERE, AND THEY DIDN'T DO THAT. ELIZABETH FINALLY ADMITS WHAT THE POLICE ALREADY KNOW... THAT SHE HAD A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP WITH HER PARENTS AND THEY REJECTED HER BOYFRIEND. MR. HAYSOM MADE IT VERY PLAIN TO JENS THAT HE DID NOT WANT ELIZABETH SEEING HIM. HE FLAT TOLD HIM THAT ELIZABETH WAS JUST, BASICALLY, BETTER THAN HE WAS, TOO GOOD FOR HIM. ELIZABETH VIEWED THE REJECTION OF JENS BY HER PARENTS AS ESSENTIALLY YET ANOTHER REJECTION. IT WAS JUST ADDING MORE FUEL TO THIS EVER-MOUNTING FIRE OF DISCONTENT, HOSTILITY, AND ANGER THAT WAS BUILDING. A FATHER'S DISAPPROVAL OF HIS DAUGHTER'S BOYFRIEND HARDLY SEEMS MOTIVE FOR MURDER. BUT INVESTIGATORS NEED TO BE SURE. I HAD TO ASK HER IF SHE WOULD GIVE US HER FINGERPRINTS, HER BLOOD, AND ANATOMICAL FOOTPRINTS... SO THAT WE COULD ELIMINATE HER AS A SUSPECT IN HER PARENTS' DEATH... WHICH SHE GAVE FREELY. THE FOOTPRINTS OF ELIZABETH CAME BACK. THEY DIDN'T MATCH WHAT WE HAD. ALL RIGHT. APPRECIATE IT. IT ELIMINATED HER. IT DIDN'T PUT HER IN THE HOUSE AT THE TIME OF THE HOMICIDES. THAT LEAVES JENS SOERING. POLICE BRING HIM IN FOR QUESTIONING. HIS DEMEANOR THAT DAY WAS VERY ARROGANT. HE WAS VERY COCKY. HE GAVE ME THE IMPRESSION THAT HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS SMARTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE. IN FACT, HE TOLD US THAT HE WAS APPALLED THAT WE WERE EVEN CONSIDERING HIM OR EVEN NEEDED TO TALK TO HIM. HE CERTAINLY DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A PERSON WHO COULD COMMIT DOUBLE HOMICIDE AND BUTCHER TWO PEOPLE UP. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT A PERSON LIKE THAT LOOKS LIKE. WHEN JENS REFUSES TO GIVE BLOOD OR PRINT SAMPLES, INVESTIGATORS TURN TO A CLASSIC PLOY. RICKY AND I KIND OF PLAYED THE GOOD GUY, THE BAD GUY. WHILE I WAS PLAYING THE BAD COP AND BASICALLY ACCUSING JENS OF MURDERING THE HAYSOMS... BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T COOPERATE WITH US... CHUCK KEPT REASSURING HIM THAT... HE SAID, "I KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO IT. "I KNOW YOU AREN'T CAPABLE OF DOING THAT. "JUST TO PROVE HIM WRONG, "WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND GIVE US YOUR FINGERPRINTS? WHY DON'T YOU COOPERATE?" AND THEN I WOULD SAY, "THE REASON HE WON'T GIVE IT TO US IS BECAUSE HE DID IT." BUT JENS WON'T TAKE THE BAIT. HE CALMLY CORROBORATES ELIZABETH'S STORY ABOUT GETTING LOST TRAVELING TO WASHINGTON, D.C. I SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW, IN MY MIND, "I'M 99% SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT GUILTY OF THIS, "BUT THAT 1% IS STILL THERE. "AND IF YOU WILL SUBMIT TO THE FOOTPRINTS "AND THE FINGERPRINTS AND THE BLOOD, "THEN YOU CAN CLEAR UP THAT 1% FOR ME AND PROVE 100% THAT YOU'RE NOT GUILTY." JENS AGREES TO THINK ABOUT IT. AFTER THE INTERVIEWS, POLICE BEGIN TO GET A CLEARER PICTURE OF ELIZABETH AND JENS. THEY'RE MADLY IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER. BUT ONCE YOU TALK TO THEM, YOU SEE THAT ELIZABETH IS THE MANIPULATOR AND THE LEADER BETWEEN THE TWO. THEN ON THE FOLLOWING WEDNESDAY, I GOT A CALL FROM JENS. AND JENS TOLD ME THAT HE HAD THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND HE HAD CONSENTED AND HE WOULD MEET WITH ME THE FOLLOWING WEEK. THE NIGHT BEFORE THE APPOINTMENT, INVESTIGATORS RECEIVE A FRANTIC CALL FROM ELIZABETH'S BROTHER HOWARD. OKAY, SEE YOU LATER. BYE. AND HE WAS SAYING, "I TOLD YOU THEY DID IT. "I TOLD YOU THEY DID IT. THEY'VE GONE. YOU'VE LET THEM GET AWAY." ELIZABETH AND JENS HAVE DISAPPEARED. INVESTIGATORS ON A DOUBLE HOMICIDE IN VIRGINIA HIT A MAJOR ROADBLOCK WHEN THEIR PRIME SUSPECTS GO ON THE RUN. AS MUCH AS WE WANT THEM TO MAKE A MOVE SOMEWAY OR ANOTHER TO PROVE THE POINT TO US THAT WE WAS ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND THEY WERE GUILTY, I WAS LIKE, "GOSH, NOW WHAT DO WE DO?" THEY SEARCH THE APARTMENT FOR ANY CLUES TO THEIR WHEREABOUTS. WHEN JENS AND ELIZABETH DISAPPEARED, THEY DID SO COMPLETELY. THEIR FAMILY DID NOT KNOW WHERE THEY WERE, THE POLICE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE, AND THEY JUST DISAPPEARED. INVESTIGATORS SUSPECT THEY FLED TO EUROPE, SINCE THEY HAD BOTH PREVIOUSLY LIVED THERE. SO, WE HAD CONTACTED SOME OF THE AIRPORTS. AND ABOUT THREE DAYS LATER, WE RECEIVED WORD THAT HIS CAR HAD BEEN FOUND AT THE AIRPORT IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY. THE PAIR LEFT NO CLUES IN THE CAR AND NO MONEY IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS. THE EVIDENCE AGAINST THEM IS ONLY CIRCUMSTANTIAL, SO INTERPOL CAN'T ISSUE AN INTERNATIONAL MANHUNT. BUT VIRGINIA AUTHORITIES URGE THEM TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT. JUST HAVE TO BIDE OUR TIME AND HOPE FOR THE BEST AND WAIT TILL SOMETHING HAPPENS. WE KNOW THEY LEFT FOR A REASON, AND WE KNOW THEY'RE GUILTY. BUT POLICE KNOW THEIR FUGITIVES HAVE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE TRAVELING THE WORLD AND ARE FLUENT IN MANY LANGUAGES. THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE. ELIZABETH AND JENS FIRST GO TO LONDON, BUT THEY DON'T STAY THERE LONG. I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY MOVE ON, BUT THEY GO TO THAILAND. THEY HAVE A LITTLE SCHEME GOING INVOLVING TRAVELER'S CHECKS. THEY GO INTO THE UNDERWORLD, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, WHERE JENS AND ELIZABETH HAVE FALSE I.D.s MADE. AND THEN FOR SOME REASON, THEY DECIDE TO GO BACK TO LONDON. THE PAIR RESEARCH THE ENGLISH BANKING SYSTEM. AND, WITH FAKE CANADIAN I.D.s, THEY OPEN A BANK ACCOUNT. JENS AND ELIZABETH MOVE TO CANTERBURY, ENGLAND, WHERE THEY BLEND IN AS CANADIAN EXCHANGE STUDENTS. THEY DEVISE A SCHEME TO GET MORE MONEY. ELIZABETH AND JENS DECIDE TO TARGET A VERY PROMINENT UPSCALE DEPARTMENT-STORE CHAIN IN LONDON. AND THE WAY THEY OPERATE THIS IS THEY GO INTO A STORE AND THEY BUY A NUMBER OF HIGH-VALUE ITEMS AND PAY FOR IT WITH A CHECK THAT TURNS OUT TO BE HOT. BEFORE THE CHECK CAN BOUNCE, THEY TAKE THOSE ITEMS AND GO TO ANOTHER BRANCH OF THE SAME STORE AND RETURN THEM FOR CASH. THEIR PLAN WORKS FOR A WHILE. BUT ON APRIL 30, 1986, THEY ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF A STORE CLERK. SALES RECEIPT? SHE CALLS OVER AN OFF-DUTY POLICEMAN AND EXPRESSES HER SUSPICION TO HIM, AND HE FOLLOWS THEM AROUND AND THEN DECIDES TO TAKE THEM TO A POLICE STATION. JENS AND ELIZABETH ARE ANXIOUS TO DIVERT THE DETECTIVES' ATTENTION AWAY FROM THEM. IN USING THEIR FALSE NAMES, THEY CREATE THIS FALSE PERSONA THAT ELIZABETH IS THERE TO WRITE A BOOK AND JENS IS GOING TO ENROLL AS A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY IN BATH. BUT THE POLICE ARE NOT CONVINCED. BELIEVING THEY MAY BE INVOLVED IN OTHER CRIMES, POLICE THREATEN TO GET A WARRANT TO SEARCH THEIR FLAT, UNTIL JENS GIVES IN AND ALLOWS THEM TO ENTER. SINCE THE U.K. HAS DIFFERENT PRIVACY LAWS THAN THE U.S., THEY DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM. THEY JUST GO AND START DIGGING IN DRAWERS AND PULLING OUT STUFF FROM CLOSETS. THEY FIND SEVERAL BAGS OF STORE MERCHANDISE WITH RECEIPTS AND A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE TWO HAD WORN DURING THE PURCHASES. THEY UNCOVER A CACHE OF FAKE I.D.s, INCLUDING THEIR TRUE IDENTIFICATION... AND SOMETHING FAR MORE OMINOUS. THEY START LOOKING THROUGH THESE PAPERS THEY HAVE COLLECTED, INCLUDING THE DIARY AND THE LETTERS THEY HAVE WRITTEN TO EACH OTHER, AND THEY SEE MENTIONS OF A MURDER. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MURDER OCCURRED, WHEN IT OCCURRED, OR HOW THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THIS. IN ONE LETTER, ELIZABETH TELLS JENS THEY COULD BE HAPPY IF ONLY HER PARENTS WERE DEAD. BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDERED INDIVIDUALS ARE MORE PRONE TO HARBOR RAGEFUL FANTASIES TOWARDS OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE OFFENDED THEM. THE POLICE HAVE ENOUGH TO HOLD THE COUPLE ON CHECK FRAUD WHILE THEY SORT OUT THE MYSTERY OF THE LETTERS AND DIARIES. FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE CORRESPONDENCE POINTS THEM IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THEY FOUND SOME LETTERS IN THEIR BELONGINGS REFERRING TO MYSELF AND INVESTIGATOR GARDNER. THEY, IN FACT, IN THE LETTERS, WROTE THAT WE WERE LOCAL YOKELS AND THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE WERE DOING AND THAT REID AND I HAD PROBABLY GOTTEN FIRED. ON MAY 30th, SEVEN MONTHS AFTER JENS AND ELIZABETH FLED THE COUNTRY, INVESTIGATORS IN VIRGINIA GET A SURPRISING CALL FROM A BRITISH DETECTIVE WHO SAYS THEY HAVE JENS AND ELIZABETH IN CUSTODY. OKAY. AND HE SAID, "WERE HER PARENTS MURDERED?" AND I SAID, "YES, THEY WERE." AND HE SAYS, "I THINK WE HAVE THE MURDERERS LOCKED UP IN OUR JAIL, AND YOU MAY NEED TO TALK TO THEM." I THOUGHT SOMEBODY WAS PLAYING A REAL BAD JOKE ON ME AT FIRST. I'VE GOT THIS PERSON CALLING ME ON THE PHONE WHO I HAVE NO IDEA WHO IT IS. AND THEY'RE TELLING ME THIS, AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER TO CRY OR SCREAM OR WHAT. AFTER RECEIVING WORD THAT FUGITIVES ELIZABETH HAYSOM AND JENS SOERING ARE IN A BRITISH JAIL... ...AUTHORITIES FROM VIRGINIA IMMEDIATELY FLY TO ENGLAND. AT FIRST, BOTH SUSPECTS DENY ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE MURDERS. BUT AFTER THREE DAYS OF QUESTIONING, ON JUNE 8th, JENS IS READY TO TALK. HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED... THE TRUTH. AND HE STARTED TELLING ME ABOUT THEM RENTING THE RENTAL CAR AND THAT THEY HAD PLANNED THIS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME... ...AND THAT HE, IN FACT, HAD DRIVEN BACK ON THAT SATURDAY EVENING. HE SAYS HE WANTED TO TRY TO CONVINCE MR. AND MRS. HAYSOM TO ACCEPT HIM IN ELIZABETH'S LIFE. BUT IF THEY TURNED HIM DOWN, THEN HE WAS GONNA HAVE TO DO WHAT HE HAD TO DO. NO! NO! NO, SHE DOESN'T! AND THEN MR. HAYSOM WAS ADAMANT THAT HE WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEIR DAUGHTER. I TELL YOU, YOU'RE GETTING OUT OF THIS HOUSE NOW! HIS WORDS WERE, "I FREAKED OUT." YOU ARE GOING OUT OF THIS HOUSE. I'M GONNA THROW YOU OUT. STOP, STOP, STOP. MY GOD! AAH! AND HE... CUT MR. HAYSOM'S THROAT. AS JENS GIVES FURTHER DETAILS ABOUT THE MURDERS, AUTHORITIES INTERVIEW ELIZABETH. SHE SAYS SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE MURDERS UNTIL AFTERWARDS. BUT THE DIARY AND THE LETTERS SUGGEST OTHERWISE. WHEN PARTNERS IN A CRIMINAL PAIRING ARE CAUGHT AND THEY'RE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO THE SPELL OF EACH OTHER AND THE SHARED REALITY THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE, THEY WILL OFTEN TURN ON EACH OTHER. ON DECEMBER 30, 1986, INVESTIGATORS CHARGE ELIZABETH WITH BEING AN ACCESSORY BEFORE THE FACT. AND JENS IS CHARGED WITH TWO COUNTS OF CAPITAL MURDER. HIS CONVICTION COULD MEAN THE DEATH PENALTY. ONCE JENS REALIZES THAT HE COULD BE EXECUTED, HE'S NOT SO ANXIOUS TO GET BACK TO THE STATES. THE BRITISH ARE NOT SO ANXIOUS TO RELEASE HIM, EITHER, BECAUSE THEY'VE OUTLAWED THE DEATH PENALTY IN THE U.K. AND IN MOST OF EUROPE. SO JENS TAKES HIS CASE TO THE WORLD COURT, AND HE FIGHTS QUITE A BATTLE. AS PART OF HIS DEFENSE, A COURT-APPOINTED PSYCHOLOGIST EXAMINES ELIZABETH AND JENS. THE EVALUATION DONE ON MS. HAYSOM INDICATED THAT SHE WAS "A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR." AND IT GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THE MANIPULATIVENESS. AND THE TARGET OF THIS MANIPULATION IS JENS SOERING, CAUGHT IN A FOLIE à DEUX, MEANING "A MADNESS SHARED BY TWO." A FOLIE à DEUX IS A DELUSIONAL SYSTEM THAT WE USUALLY SEE IN TWO OR MORE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IN CLOSE PHYSICAL PROXIMITY. SO, WHAT HAPPENS IS THE PERSON WITH THE DELUSIONS BECOMES CONTAGIOUS TO THE PERSON WHO IS NOT DELUSIONAL. IT'S A DISEASE WHERE TWO PEOPLE DEVELOP A PARTICULAR WAY OF DOING THINGS OR SEEING THINGS THAT IS UNIQUE TO THEM. I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THIS IS A FOLIE à DEUX CASE. THE SIMPLE EXPLANATION IS THAT HE WAS A NAIVE YOUNG MAN, AND THAT BECAUSE OF HIS LACK OF CONFIDENCE AND HIS NEEDINESS, THAT SHE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND MANIPULATED HIM INTO DOING THINGS THAT HE OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT. JENS... INEXPERIENCED, INFATUATED... WAS ILL-EQUIPPED TO PROTECT HIMSELF FROM ELIZABETH. PEOPLE MIGHT WONDER WHY A PERSON AS BRIGHT AS JENS WOULD NOT HAVE THE JUDGMENT TO GET HIMSELF OUT OF THE SITUATION OR BE ABLE TO SEE THE KIND OF SITUATION HE'S GETTING HIMSELF INTO WITH MS. HAYSOM. INTELLECTUAL INTELLIGENCE AND EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL INTELLIGENCE ARE SEPARATE ISSUES. MS. HAYSOM'S EASE OF MANIPULATION OF JENS BEGS A QUESTION... HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN? AT THE END OF THE DAY, SHE IS A MASTER MANIPULATOR. ELIZABETH DOES NOT FIGHT EXTRADITION AND RETURNS TO THE UNITED STATES ON MAY 8, 1987. SHE AGREES TO SPEAK WITH INVESTIGATORS AGAIN BEFORE THE TRIAL. SHE SAYS SHE THOUGHT THAT JENS MIGHT KILL HER PARENTS THAT NIGHT, BUT SHE DIDN'T THINK HE'D GO THROUGH WITH IT. SHE SAID, "YES, IT WAS MY IDEA TO MURDER MY PARENTS. "BUT ULTIMATELY, HE HAD A FOUR-HOUR DRIVE TO CHANGE HIS MIND." "AND HE DECIDED NOT TO DO THAT. SO, ULTIMATELY, THE DECISION TO KILL MY PARENTS WAS HIS." WHY DID ELIZABETH NOT WARN HER PARENTS THAT JENS WAS EN ROUTE TO THEIR HOME, ARMED WITH A KNIFE, FULLY INTENDING TO KILL THE BOTH OF THEM? SHE SAYS THAT AFTER SHE LEARNED OF THE MURDERS, SHE STAYED WITH JENS OUT OF LOYALTY AND OBLIGATION. THE MURDERS, ON SOME LEVEL, COULD HAVE BROUGHT THEM CLOSER TOGETHER, PSYCHOLOGICALLY SPEAKING, EMOTIONALLY SPEAKING. BEFORE THE MURDERS, HER PARENTS ABSOLUTELY RULED AND RAN HER LIFE, AND JENS KILLED THEM FOR THAT. AND THAT NIGHT, WHEN HE GOT BACK, HE ABSOLUTELY TOOK THEIR PLACE, BECAUSE HE SAID, "I MURDERED YOUR PARENTS FOR YOU. YOU OWE ME NOW." IN OCTOBER 1987, ELIZABETH PLEADS GUILTY TO TWO COUNTS OF ACCESSORY BEFORE THE FACT... ...AND RECEIVES A 90-YEAR SENTENCE IN EXCHANGE FOR HER TESTIMONY AGAINST JENS SOERING. BUT IT TAKES THREE YEARS OF LEGAL BATTLES TO RETURN JENS TO THE U.S. TO FACE TRIAL. THEY EXTRADITE HIM, BUT THEY SAY THAT HE CANNOT BE PUT TO DEATH. SO HE'S SENT BACK UNDER THE... UNDER THE PROVISION THAT HE WILL NOT BE EXECUTED. IN JUNE 1990, JENS STANDS TRIAL IN VIRGINIA. THE COURT ORDERS FOOTPRINT AND BLOOD SAMPLES TO COMPARE AGAINST THE EVIDENCE FOUND AT THE HOUSE. ELIZABETH EVENTUALLY TESTIFIES AGAINST HIM. WELL, SHE TESTIFIED AT HIS TRIAL TO THE FACT THAT, YEAH, SHE PLANTED THE SEED, BUT, ULTIMATELY, IT WAS UP TO JENS. DURING THEIR TRIALS, THEY TOLD WILDLY CONFLICTING TALES OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT. ELIZABETH SAID SHE WAITED IN WASHINGTON, WHILE JENS WENT BACK TO VIRGINIA TO KILL HER PARENTS. HE SAYS, "NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED. "I STAYED IN WASHINGTON. "ELIZABETH WENT BACK WITH SOME OF HER DRUG FRIENDS, AND THEY KILLED THE HAYSOMS." AFTER FOUR YEARS OF INCARCERATION... JENS CLAIMS THAT HE INITIALLY TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MURDERS IN ORDER TO PROTECT ELIZABETH. BUT FORENSIC TESTING SHOWS IT WAS JENS' BLOOD TYPE IN THE HOUSE, HIS BLOODY SOCKPRINT ON THE FLOOR. ON JUNE 21, 1990, JENS SOERING IS FOUND GUILTY ON TWO COUNTS OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. HE IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. ELIZABETH SAID JENS COMMITTED THE MURDERS. WHEN JENS GOES TO TRIAL, HE SAYS ELIZABETH COMMITTED THE MURDERS. AND WE'LL PROBABLY NEVER KNOW FOR SURE EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT.
