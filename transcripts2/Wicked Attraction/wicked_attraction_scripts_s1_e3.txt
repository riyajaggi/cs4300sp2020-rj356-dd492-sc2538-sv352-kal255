 IN THE EARLY-MORNING HOURS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 1997, THE PLACER COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE GETS A 911 CALL ABOUT A YOUNG WOMAN WANDERING ALONG INTERSTATE 80 IN AUBURN, CALIFORNIA. SHE SAYS SHE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED AND RAPED. DISPATCH CALLED ME AT HOME AND ASKED ME TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. THE VICTIM WAS VERY SHAKEN. SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY UPSET. I THINK THAT SHE WAS VERY RELIEVED TO HAVE SURVIVED THIS ORDEAL. SHE IS ABLE TO TELL THE POLICE WHAT HAPPENED. SHE HAD BEEN WALKING HOME FROM HER SCHOOL.

 AND SHE WAS WALKING DOWN WASHINGTON STREET IN RENO, NEVADA, WHEN SHE HEARD A VEHICLE COME UP BEHIND HER. GO, GO, GO! THE VICTIM TOLD THE OFFICERS THAT A FEMALE WAS DRIVING THE VAN AND THAT THE MALE GAVE HER INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO GET TO THE FREEWAY FROM WHERE THEY WERE. SHE WASN'T SURE WHETHER THIS WOMAN WAS ALSO, HERSELF, A CAPTIVE IN SOME FASHION. SHE ATTEMPTED TO GET SOME SUPPORT OR SOME HELP FROM THIS WOMAN WHO WAS DRIVING THE VAN. EVENTUALLY, THE VICTIM REALIZED THAT THIS WOMAN WAS ASSISTING THIS MAN IN THIS ABDUCTION.

 THEY THEN TOOK HER ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS, TO AUBURN. IN THE COURSE OF THIS ABDUCTION, THERE WAS A NUMBER OF SEXUAL ACTS PERFORMED ON THIS WOMAN. I THINK THE TERM "SEXUAL PREDATOR" CERTAINLY APPLIES TO THESE TWO OFFENDERS. OFFENDERS WHO ENGAGE IN SEXUAL BEHAVIOR THAT IS SADISTIC... THAT IS, WHERE THEY'RE DERIVING SEXUAL PLEASURE FROM THE SUFFERING AND HUMILIATION AND CONTROL OVER ANOTHER VICTIM. THEY LACK THE ABILITY TO CARE ABOUT ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. HER INTENT WAS TO REMEMBER AS MUCH ABOUT HIM AS SHE COULD SO THAT SHE COULD IDENTIFY HIM IF SHE SURVIVED THIS ORDEAL. AFTER HOURS OF ABUSE, THE COUPLE FINALLY DROPS HER OFF ON A DESERTED ROAD IN CALIFORNIA, MORE THAN 90 MILES FROM WHERE SHE WAS KIDNAPPED. THE VAN PULLED UP HERE, SOMEWHERE IN THIS AREA ALONG HERE. THE VICTIM HAD ALREADY BEEN INSTRUCTED TO GET DRESSED. AT THAT POINT, WHEN THEY STOPPED THE VAN, SHE WAS GIVEN HER PURSE AND HER BACKPACK. THEY WARNED HER NOT TO GO WALKING BY HERSELF ANYMORE AT NIGHT IN RENO AND SAID THAT SHE WAS VERY LUCKY THAT SHE HAD BEEN PICKED UP BY TWO SUCH NICE PEOPLE. AND, AT THAT POINT, THEY LET HER OUT OF THE VAN, TOLD HER TO TURN HER FACE AWAY, COUNT TO 20, AND THEN THEY DROVE OFF. THE WOMAN WALKS TOWARD THE INTERSTATE, WHERE SHE FLAGS DOWN HELP. ALTHOUGH IN SHOCK, THE VICTIM GIVES DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF HER ATTACKERS. SHE MADE SURE TO LOOK AROUND HER SURROUNDINGS, TO REMEMBER THE FACES THAT SHE SAW. SHE LISTENED TO THEIR VOICES. SHE REMEMBERED THE SMELLS. WHEN THE MALE WAS TALKING TO THE FEMALE SUSPECT, THAT HE CALLED HER "MICKEY." POLICE DEVELOP COMPOSITES OF THE SUSPECTS AND PUT OUT AN A.P.B. FOR THEM AND THEIR VAN. BECAUSE THE VICTIM WAS TAKEN ACROSS STATE LINES, THE FBI IS NOTIFIED. IT'S PRETTY RARE TO HAVE A MALE AND A FEMALE TOGETHER DOING A SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A STRANGER. SO THAT DEFINITELY GETS THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK UP THAT YOU HAVE A PRETTY DANGEROUS PREDATOR PAIR OUT THERE. AND, HISTORICALLY, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MALE/FEMALE TEAMS THAT HAVE OPERATED IN THIS AREA. IN THE 1980s, GERALD AND CHARLENE GALLEGO WERE A MALE-AND-FEMALE KIDNAP, RAPE, AND MURDER TEAM THAT WERE OPERATING IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. THEY HAD, I THINK, ABOUT 10 VICTIMS. THE GALLEGOS DUMPED ONE OF THEIR VICTIMS IN CLIPPER GAP... WHERE THE YOUNG WOMAN ABDUCTED AND RAPED FROM RENO WAS RECENTLY LET GO. AUTHORITIES FEAR THERE MAY BE A COPYCAT ON THE LOOSE. THESE ARE HIGH-PRIORITY CASES FOR THE FBI. THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE THAT MIGHT BE GETTING READY TO PREY ON ANOTHER VICTIM NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO, IN THESE KIND OF CASES, WE DROP EVERYTHING, GET OUT THERE, AND START DEVELOPING LEADS... RECOVERING EVIDENCE, DOING INTERVIEWS AS SOON AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. MORE THAN A MONTH PASSES WITHOUT ANY OF THEIR EFFORTS PAYING OFF. AND THE CASE GOES COLD. NOVEMBER 3, 1997, IS A SLOW NIGHT AT WORK FOR 17-YEAR-OLD LINDA MARSHALL IN PLEASANTON, CALIFORNIA. THERE IS ANOTHER SEXUAL ATTACK IN WHICH BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE ATTEMPTED TO HAVE SEX WITH THIS WOMAN. THEY BEAT HER. THEY ENDED UP TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OF HER. AND THEY SAID, "WELL, IF YOU TELL WHAT WE'VE DONE, "WE'RE GOING TO LET THESE PHOTOGRAPHS OUT, AND WE'RE GOING TO BLACKMAIL YOU." EVENTUALLY, SHE, OF COURSE, WAS AFRAID THAT THEY WOULD KILL HER. WHEN SHE IS RELEASED, LINDA GOES TO THE POLICE. BUT INSTEAD OF TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT HER ATTACKERS, SHE LIES. LINDA IS AFRAID OF THEM AND AWARE OF THE PHOTOS THEY POSSESS. SHE CLAIMS SHE WAS ABDUCTED AND RAPED BY THREE MEN. HER STORY SEEMS SUSPICIOUS TO THE POLICE, AND WHEN THEY CONFRONT HER ABOUT HER INCONSISTENCIES, SHE DROPS THE CASE. THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL TEND TO INCREASE IN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE BEHAVIOR THAT THEY'RE ENGAGING IN, SOMETIMES SEEKING MORE EXTREME OR MORE DIVERSE KINDS OF BEHAVIORS IN ORDER TO GET THE SAME DEGREE OF FULFILLMENT. MANY OF THEM, PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY'RE ENGAGING IN EXTREME VIOLENCE AND SADISM, DO NOT STOP ON THEIR OWN. IN THE FALL OF 1997, AUBURN, CALIFORNIA, AUTHORITIES SEARCH FOR TWO SUSPECTS IN A KIDNAPPING-AND-RAPE CASE. WITH ONLY DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PERPETRATORS... A MALE AND FEMALE TEAM... AND THEIR VAN AND UNAWARE OF ANY OTHER CRIMES COMMITTED BY THE COUPLE, THE POLICE RUN OUT OF LEADS AND THEIR CASE IS AT A STANDSTILL. ON NOVEMBER 19, 1997, SACRAMENTO POLICE OFFICERS RESPOND TO A RESIDENCE TO TAKE A REPORT ON A POSSIBLE SEXUAL ASSAULT. TWO TEENAGE GIRLS TELL OFFICERS THEY WERE BOTH RAPED AT DIFFERENT TIMES BY THE SAME COUPLE. THE MOST SHOCKING REVELATION WAS THE FACT THAT ONE OF THE GIRLS WAS MOLESTED BY HER OWN MOTHER AND PROVIDED TO HER BOYFRIEND FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES. THE KIND OF OFFENDER THAT WOULD GIVE UP THEIR OWN CHILD FOR SEXUAL ABUSE TO ANOTHER OFFENDER AND EVEN PARTICIPATE IN THAT ABUSE AND EXPLOITATION IS JUST AS CULPABLE OF AN OFFENDER AND LIKELY SHARES SIMILAR KINDS OF DEVIANT FANTASIES AND IMPULSES AND IS THE KIND OF A PERSON WHO, SIMILARLY, IS UNABLE TO HAVE ANY COMPASSION OR CARING FOR THAT CHILD. THERE IS MORE TO THE STORY. THE TWO GIRLS HAD ALSO TOLD US THAT THEY HAD SEEN A REPORT ON TV A FEW WEEKS PRIOR ABOUT A KIDNAP/RAPE OUT OF RENO, AND THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MALE AND FEMALE SUSPECTS, AS WELL AS THE VEHICLE, WERE VERY SIMILAR. THE GIRLS GIVE INVESTIGATORS THE NAMES OF THEIR ATTACKERS... JAMES "FROGGY" DAVEGGIO... AND MICHELLE "MICKEY" MICHAUD. WITHIN A DAY OR TWO OF THE RENO KIDNAPPING AND RAPE, MICHAUD AND DAVEGGIO KNEW THAT THE AUTHORITIES WERE AFTER THEM BECAUSE THE COMPOSITE OF DAVEGGIO WAS PUBLISHED IN THE NEWSPAPER AND IT WAS ON TELEVISION. SO THEY CERTAINLY KNEW FROM THE VERY BEGINNING THAT THE POLICE HAD REASON TO SUSPECT THEM. I RAN RECORD CHECKS ON EVERYBODY INVOLVED AND FOUND THAT DAVEGGIO WAS A REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER WHO HAD JUST RECENTLY REGISTERED IN SACRAMENTO AND THAT MICHELLE MICHAUD WAS A PROSTITUTE WHO HAD BEEN ARRESTED FOR PROSTITUTION SEVERAL TIMES. POLICE ARE NOT SURPRISED TO SEE THAT EACH HAS A LONG HISTORY OF OFFENSES. JAMES ANTHONY DAVEGGIO WAS BORN IN 1960 IN SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA. HE HAD A VERY UNHAPPY UPBRINGING. HIS MOTHER WAS THE DOMINANT PERSONALITY IN HIS HOUSEHOLD. SHE WAS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS SEX CRIMES, EVEN AS A JUVENILE. HE HAD MANY DIFFICULTIES, PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES... A LOT OF BAGGAGE, A LOT OF RAGE, A LOT OF ANGER... AT WOMEN, ESPECIALLY. MICHELLE MICHAUD WAS TWO YEARS OLDER THAN JAMES DAVEGGIO, GREW UP IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. SHE RAN AWAY FROM HOME WHEN SHE WAS 17. SHE ENCOUNTERED A PIMP WHO TURNED HER OUT, PUT HER ON THE STREET. EVENTUALLY, SHE WOUND UP WORKING IN MASSAGE PARLORS. JAMES DAVEGGIO AND MICHELLE MICHAUD MET IN OCTOBER OF 1996 IN A BAR WHERE DAVEGGIO WORKED. MICHAUD AND DAVEGGIO WERE PRIMARILY DRAWN TOGETHER BECAUSE OF THEIR MUTUAL ADDICTION TO METHAMPHETAMINE. METHAMPHETAMINE IS A PSYCHOSTIMULANT, AND WHEN PEOPLE TAKE IN METHAMPHETAMINE... WHETHER THEY'RE SHOOTING IT UP, WHETHER THEY'RE SNORTING IT, OR WHETHER THEY'RE SMOKING IT... WHAT WE TYPICALLY SEE WITH A PERSON WHO'S INTOXICATED WITH METH IS EUPHORIA, AN INCREASE IN THEIR LEVEL OF IMPULSIVENESS. PARANOIA CAN BE PART OF IT, AGGRESSIVENESS, FIGHTING, DELUSIONS... A PERSON COULD LOSE CONTACT WITH REALITY. BASICALLY, AN EROSION OF THE VALUE STRUCTURE THAT THEY HAD. AND IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE A GOOD VALUE STRUCTURE TO BEGIN WITH, IT'S GONNA GO FURTHER DOWNHILL AND MORE EXTREME ACTS ARE GOING TO BE MORE LIKELY. MICHAUD AND DAVEGGIO TENDED TO PROJECT ONTO THE OTHER WHAT THEY WANTED TO SEE IN ANOTHER PERSON. AND MICHAUD WOULD SAY LATER THAT SHE PERCEIVED DAVEGGIO AS BEING A STRONG FATHERLY FIGURE THAT AROUND WHICH THE FAMILY COULD COALESCE. I THINK DAVEGGIO... FROGGY... SAW HER AS SOMEBODY WHO WAS WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO PLEASE HIM, AS HE ALWAYS EXPECTED WOMEN TO DO. A PERSON WHO HAS TREATED WOMEN AS OBJECTS, AS MR. DAVEGGIO DID, VERY WELL COULD RECOGNIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ADDICTION TO METHAMPHETAMINE MIGHT REPRESENT. THAT IS, HE MAY SEE THAT IF THE PERSON HE'S INVOLVED WITH... FOR EXAMPLE, MICHELLE MICHAUD... IS HOOKED ON METH AND HE'S THE GUY THAT CAN FUND THAT HABIT OR PROVIDE THAT METHAMPHETAMINE, HE VERY WELL COULD USE THAT AS A WAY OF CONTROLLING HER. THE FACT THAT MICHAUD IS A PROSTITUTE AND DAVEGGIO IS ALREADY A SEXUAL PREDATOR MAKES THEM AN IDEAL MATCH. YOU'VE GOT A PROSTITUTE, WHOSE JOB IS TO BASICALLY USE HER BODY AS A COMMODITY,
