 Gates returns to rescue Arnott but leaves before Kate, her cover now blown, arrives to find evidence that a body had been stored at the warehouse. Arnott recalls that the chief torturer was...

 Aargh!
 This is Gates.
 What you wanted, it's happening,
now you gotta give me Jackie's body.
 'What? And ruin our relationship?'
 It isn't about me
versus you any more. I'm sorry.
 I take pride
in the courage and professionalism
of my counterterrorism officers.
 Admit our mistake, apologise,
and get on with the job of finding
the actual terrorists.
 Pointing the finger at your own?
 Greek Lane's been under
investigation as the
scene of a double homicide.
 The evidence points very strongly to
these men being involved
 in a terrorist operation.
 It was Tony,
he was the one that gave the order.
 Officer of the year...
 Is something going on between you?
No.
 Chief Inspector Anthony Gates.
 Two identical phones -
don't bother saying there's
an innocent explanation.
 I'm AC-12, call IT now and get them
to unlock this bloody computer!
 Now! Talk!
 What's wrong with these things?
 What d'you know about our business?
 Come on, I need this information.
 Who have you told?
 I don't know anything.
 Liar. Idiot!
 Get that finger in there.
 Oh, these don't work!
 I ain't a bloody kid!
 Then we do him, like Tommy says.
 The police, let's go! Go, go!
 Go!
 Hey, where you going? Come here.
 You bent bastard!
 Argh!
 Ah, you bust me leg!
 Get down.
 And shut up!
 Argh!
 No...
 Please.
 Steve? I'm fine.
 You sure? Yeah.
 Look, you should go.
 It's OK, my cover's blown.
 What?
 It doesn't matter, I lost Gates.
 There's no sign of him here.
 Look, I'll follow you to
the hospital, all right?
 Bastard! Calm down, Ryan,
you'll only hurt yourself.
 Where's the water cannon
when you need it?
 Who nicked him?
DS Arnott said he did.
 Who arrested you, Ryan?
 DC Fleming asked you a question,
Ryan.
 I ain't saying nothing
without a solicitor!
 Jools?
 Jools, are you here?
 Jools!
 Jools!
 It's OK, boy.
 It's OK.
 Shhh, boy. Shh.
 It's OK, Sam, it's OK, big man.
 Oh, Tony?
Are the girls at school?
 What are you doing here? The girls,
Jools. Yeah, of course they are.
 OK, I need you to pack a
couple of bags, pick them up early
and then take them to your mum's.
 What's going on?
Listen, I'll pack the bags myself if
I have to, but we have to get going.
 Tony, talk to me!
They killed Sammy!
 Oh, my God.
 Yeah. Don't. It's a warning.
It's me they're after.
 Who are these people? It doesn't
matter who they are, I just need
to know that you and the girls
 are safe,
that's all I care about right now.
 No, I'm not going anywhere
without you.
 Jools, you'll be safe at your mum's.
This is ridiculous,
you're the police!
 I'm calling 999.
Hey! Listen! I am on my own.
 No, you're not!
 This mess, it's mine. It's not yours
and it's not the girls'.
 I just need you to do what I say.
 I'm calling Nigel. Don't.
 There's not a bloke at the station
that won't stand by you.
Jools, stop it!
 Why are you behaving like this?
This is about Jackie, all right,
 and the people that she
was in business with.
 What are you saying?
That they killed Sammy?
 Yeah. Well, what's it
got to do with Jackie?
 They killed her, too.
 My God. When?
A couple of weeks back.
 Why didn't you say anything?
 Because I thought I'd...
I was trying to fix everything.
 How? What's going on?
It doesn't matter, all right,
they're criminals.
 Now, I need you to pack those bags
and I need you to pick up my girls.
 Why are you shutting me out?
 Because I need to be able to
handle this on my own.
 I'm not going anywhere without you.
 I was fucking her.
 OK?
 I was fucking Jackie.
 Steve.
 You all right?
 You're OK.
They operated on your hand.
 They saved your finger.
 Yeah, I'll call you back.
 Hey, Steve.
 Any sign of Gates?
 No. The house is deserted.
 DI Buckells' team have put a trace
on his phone but it's switched off.
 Right.
 We'll take a statement when you're
feeling a bit better.
 Since Gates went AWOL
just before it happened,
 we're assuming
he was involved in some capacity.
 Quite a set of charges, isn't it,
for the Officer of the Year...
 conspiracy, kidnapping, GBH,
attempted murder.
 I'm not sure he was involved, sir.
 We haven't got the evidence yet,
you mean.
 But we will get it.
Kate, we should debrief.
 Kate.
 All right, Kate, I'll see you
back at the office, yeah?
 I'm glad you're feeling better,
Steve. Thank you, sir.
 What's that about?
 Well, now my cover's blown,
 it's a question of
whether I'll stay on the case.
 Do you want to carry on?
 I think you know the answer.
 The men who were holding you got
away, but the kid's in custody.
 We won't be able to interview him
until we've tracked down
a responsible adult.
 OK.
 I heard you trashed Gates' office.
 Yeah.
 There was a freezer,
 in the place they held me.
 Struck me as odd.
 We found traces of blood on the
floor, around the freezer. Cheers.
 Hiya. There are traces of
body fluids,
 seepage from before a body
was frozen.
 I don't think the seepage products
will tell us much.
 Tells us they moved it in a hurry.
 Yeah, because they didn't clean up.
 I'm surprised you've not been
pulled out, DC Fleming.
 I say Fleming. Who knows?
 The chances are her body's in
another freezer somewhere else.
 It'll be Jackie all right.
 They'll preserve the body
as evidence against Gates.
 He didn't kill her.
 No?
 I'm not sure he's capable.
 I'll come with you.
No. I'm all right.
 Kate. Dot.
 I've just come to get my stuff.
 No hard feelings.
 Deserved it, didn't she, eh?
 Her cover isn't the only thing
she blew, you know. Ask Tony.
 Here.
 Thanks.
 Which force are you really from?
 Who was your target then, eh?
Just Gates?
 I can't discuss my brief.
 You must be pretty
pissed off though, eh,
 not getting the evidence you needed.
 I got plenty. Yeah?
 I don't see Tony Gates
in custody. Do you?
 The last time I saw Gates,
he was talking with Morton.
 If anyone's still loyal, it's him.
 What?
 Leave Morton to me.
 Here we go again.
 Has Gates called you yet?
 He knows there'll be
a trace on his phone.
 He'll find a way.
When he calls, give him a message.
 The subway between Borogrove
Estate and Moss Heath Park.
tell him I'll be there,
 alone, at midnight.
 You must think I'm
thick as pig shit.
 You don't know the situation
between me and Gates, but he does.
 What if I say, "screw you"?
 The only person you'd be screwing
is your best mate.
 Virtually all my detectives have
been seconded to the operation.
 You've responded decisively, sir.
 You two know each other?
 What you doing here?
 Chief Inspector Osborne is
contributing his expertise
 to our counter terrorism operation.
You believe this?
 The Greek Lane cell appeared exactly
the same time as ours
 dropped off the radar.
 We can't exclude
a direct connection.
 If you'll excuse us, DS Arnott.
 I'm sorry about that, Philip.
 Ah, DS Cottan,
our Acting Deputy SIO. CI Osborne.
 Cottan.
Very pleased to meet you, sir.
 Morning. Hiya,
I'm Ryan Pilkington's social worker.
 Just a minute.
 Hi. Sorry. DC Fleming.
 Will you come with me, please?
 Thanks.
 Interview under caution with
Ryan Pilkington
 by Detective Constable Fleming in
the presence of Ryan's solicitor.
 Louise Burton. Social worker.
Jane Hargreaves.
 Community Liaison Officer,
Community Juvenile Liaison Officer
 and Community Policing Case File
Officer, PC Bannerjee.
 I know things aren't
great for you at home, Ryan.
 We've had to give up
on your mum.
 She won't come in.
 She'd rather leave all this
to your case workers.
 How d'you feel about that?
 My parents split up
when I was a kid.
 You'll do anything to be
out of the house.
 You don't care what it gets
you into.
 You're right.
Our lives doesn't compare.
 But I do want to help you, Ryan.
 You're on a bad road
and you need to get off it.
 'Tell me what you know about the men
who were holding DS Arnott.
 'We know the same men were
involved in a series of incidents.'
 Two men were killed in Greek Lane.
 A drug dealer named Wesley Duke was
hung from a lamp post.
 And a woman named Jackie Laverty was
snatched from her own home.
 Four murders, Ryan.
 I need to know you had nothing
to do with them. I didn't.
 And I believe you, Ryan.
But you know about them, don't you?
 My client denies any knowledge
of these offences.
 The person who ordered those murders
is someone you work for, though,
isn't that right? I dunno.
 Don't lie to me, Ryan.
I can't help you if you do.
 'You were involved in holding
and torturing DS Arnott.'
 You spoke to a man on the phone who
was giving you the orders.
 Who's that man? I dunno.
Well, does he have a name?
 Ryan's answered the question,
DC Fleming. Ryan.
 I don't know his name.
Does he use the name "Tommy"?
 Dunno. That's the name DS Arnott
heard. Let's call him Tommy.
 Whatever.
 What do you do for Tommy, Ryan?
 Don't do nothing.
 For the tape,
I'm showing Ryan a mobile phone,
 evidence number G67389.
 Is that your phone? No.
 Well, it was recovered
from the location where you were
 holding DS Arnott.
 You're a tough kid, Ryan.
Or at least you think you are.
 Where did you get those injuries?
 If you carry on like this,
the place you're going has
 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds,
and they're built like brick sheds.
 How d'you think you'll
fare against one of those lads?
 They knock your teeth out, Ryan.
They do that so you give
a better blow job.
 I don't think that's very helpful,
DC Fleming.
 It AIN'T my phone!
 But you recognise it, don't you?
 No comment.
 What d'you do for Tommy, Ryan?
 No comment.
 Four murders, Ryan. This is serious.
 I know you're innocent.
You were just helping out with
the phones, weren't you?
 Just did the phones.
 Did what exactly?
Nick phones for 'em.
 For the lot of 'em.
They'd use 'em for a couple of days.
 Then I'd get rid of 'em.
 Right, so you needed unregistered
phones, like this one.
 That's it. The phones.
 My client has been very helpful.
Can we leave it there, please?
 Have you ever met Tommy?
 No, he does it all on the phones.
 Did he ever ask you to do anything
in relation to the woman I
mentioned earlier, Jackie Laverty?
 Like what?
 Well, we're still looking for
her body, Ryan. Where is it?
 I dunno.
 Are you sure, Ryan?
 Yeah.
 We can protect you from Tommy.
 Yeah, right!
Where's the body, Ryan?!
 DC Fleming, please. That's enough.
 There's a police officer, Ryan.
Detective Chief Inspector Gates.
 Do you know who I mean?
 Well, let's assume you do.
 Did Tommy ever give you instructions
regarding DCI Gates?
 Ryan!
 I'd give him a phone.
Tommy does all the talking.
 'My client's already admitted...'
'What did he say to Gates?'
 What did Gates say to him?
I can't remember.
Think carefully, please, Ryan.
 Did Tommy and DCI Gates ever
 'discuss kidnapping DS Arnott?
I dunno.
 'Ryan's answered your questions,
DC Fleming.'
 He's tired. Are you tired, Ryan?
 Ryan? Please.
 Think carefully.
 Did DCI Gates help kidnap DS Arnott?
 No, he was the one who RESCUED him!
 Well, thank you, Ryan.
We'll leave it there for now.
 I hope you're being looked after.
If there's anything you need,
just let me know.
 DS Arnott.
 What the hell's going on here,
Fleming?
 We got a responsible adult
but you were busy.
 You're off TO-20.
You were never bloody on it.
 Right you are, sir.
 Ryan, sorry,
 'I'm Detective Inspector Buckells.'
 'Can I have a Big Mac now?'
 Kate. Wait!
 I knew something was going on!
 When were you going to tell me?
I'm sorry.
 What? And now you "owe" him?
Gates played us. All of us.
 And he's at it again.
He saved my life!
 He put you in danger
in the first place!
He was backed into a corner.
 That we put him in, to crack
the case! You're close to Gates
and you don't understand him.
 You know what, you're screwing up
an operation I've spent months on,
Steve - undercover,
 worrying about my every move,
bricking it in case I get caught,
sleepless nights?
 Cheers, mate.
 Thanks a fucking million!
 Who else knows you're here?
 No one. Now, where's Gates?
 Arggh!
 Pillock!
 Wh...?! Aargh!
 Gates?
 What the hell's going on?
 I need to flush out any back-up,
make them come running.
 There's no back-up, it's just me.
 Yeah? So, you're looking
after your own, that's not in
the Anticorruption Code, mate.
 Well, it's mine.
 I was never on the take.
 And I was never in with criminals,
that was all Jackie.
 You pulled surveillance off Greek
Lane so they could do the murder.
I never gave that order.
 Anyone tells you different is lying.
 All the dirty money Jackie funnelled,
you never suspected?
Listen, I was an idiot.
 And I never twigged who
she was in with.
 But it was them who did the murder,
not me, and it's them I'm
hiding from, not you.
 Turn yourself in.
Give evidence against them.
 We can protect you.
 That's a bunch of crap
and you know it.
 I'm a dead man walking.
And so are you, son.
 We need to get them
before they get us.
 For Jackie's murder, for the
Greek Lane mob, and for Wesley Duke.
 Because they're the real criminals,
Arnott. Not me.
 What the hell am I supposed to do?
 Just back off.
You back off and you keep everybody
else off of me until the job's done.
 How do I know this isn't
just another one of your games?
 This is my only chance of holding
on to any of the things
I give a toss about.
 I'll give you Tommy,
and then you let me go. You got it?
 Arnott? Have you got it?!
 Yes!
 Er, Matthew. Sir.
 CI Osborne's joined us
on semi-permanent secondment.
 I'd be grateful if you could be
his point of contact.
I'd be very happy to, sir.
 I've been impressed, Matthew,
how do you feel
about sitting the inspector's exam?
 I don't know what to say, sir.
 No-one wants to step into dead man's
shoes, but Tony Gates is finished.
 I meant to ask, what brought
you into the service, Matthew?
 Well, where I grew up, sir,
there wasn't much respect
for law and order.
 You know, I could've
fallen in with a bad crowd.
 Instead, I made a few quid
caddying at the local golf club.
 I met a bloke there, sir,
who opened my eyes.
 Well, think of this as
an opportunity to help
young people like that.
 I want it, sir.
Good man. Excellent.
 The police are
here, get out, quick! Go on, go!
 Go on, go!
 Must've seen the vehicle.
 Remind me to check outstanding
warrants back at the station.
 Is that your mum's boyfriend, Ryan?
 You better have fed him.
 Right,
let's get round to the chippy.
 Just give me a minute, Kaz.
 What now?
 Ryan, I er,
I want you to know you can call me.
 I ain't no grass.
 Yeah, I know, it's just if there's
stuff you want to talk about.
 Or you want someone to buy you
a burger. That's all.
 OK. Promise?
 Right, I'll have a cod and chips.
See you there.
 Simon, what?
 I know, this is the Bog,
we never leave the vehicle.
 Hi.
 Steve, fancy a cup of tea?
 Ha, shall I be mother?
 Thank you, sir.
You know the date came through
for your inquest. It's next week.
 Right. Yeah, suppose you could
always argue that you're
not fit to testify?
 Yeah?
 Kate?
 The news came through yesterday but
I decided to let it wait. There's no
point ruining a good night's sleep.
 Did you sleep all right last night?
Good, thank you, sir.
 Yeah, I know, you know,
I mean with the arm and all that.
 Just a quiet night in, sir.
 Quiet night?
You cheeky wee shite, ya!
 Kate, you have a word with him.
 My doctor told me
to watch me blood pressure.
 The boss put an officer
on your flat. For your protection.
 He saw you stumble in
well after midnight.
 I had a meeting with Gates.
 Jesus Christ, Steve!
You're meant to be my partner.
 Well, you were never
Gates's partner, then?
 What the hell are you talking about?
If this is personal... "Personal"?
 If something happened between
you two... Like what?
 Nothing. Forget it.
What d'you want to know?
 I shouldn't have asked.
It's private. Yeah, it is.
 Here.
 Now that you and Gates
are bosom buddies,
 you'll know what to do with that.
 A wire tap?
 Yes, Steven, a wire tap.
 What is it with you?
You think you owe Gates?
 Why don't you ask yourself who
you REALLY owe?
 Yeah, yeah, I would, yeah. Yeah.
 Just a second, sorry.
 You got a minute, sir?
We're eager for an update.
 The body fluids
recovered from the freezer match
 the blood from Jackie Laverty's
house. I re-interviewed
 the ASBO Dodger, but he's never
gonna grass where they
moved the body.
 Now we're looking at the phone data.
When do you make the tissue match?
 Oh, were you not on
the distribution list?
 I do apologise.
 Sorry, Alex, carry on.
 Sir.
 So do we know how long the cell has
been operating under cover
as drug dealers?
 Yeah, well, we interviewed a known
dealer, Wesley Duke, before he died.
 He reckoned, a month, sir.
 Jermaine Duke, brother of
the deceased, says
 Wesley remarked on the reliability
from the Greek Lane suppliers.
They were organised. Not smackheads.
 Professionals. Fits with them having
a supply line running directly
from Northern Pakistan.
 Oh, don't mind me.
 A supply line running directly
from Northern Pakistan?
 Makes a change from nicking
chavs on Moss Heath.
 You must be creaming yourselves.
 This is a private meeting, Arnott.
 Fine. I'll wait.
 Excuse me.
 Come on.
 Right, you've got 30 seconds.
 I'd like to explore the possibility
the Greek Lane residents
weren't terrorists.
 Naturally, I'm open to
all possibilities.
 I've been conducting an in-depth
operation against DCI Tony Gates.
 And at no point
in Gates's investigation did
 he ever develop
a lead into a terror connection.
 Not until he obtained evidence
of the bomb-making activity.
 Sir, it was household bleach
and a chemistry book.
 Those lads were making crack,
not IEDs. And Gates knows that.
 He only dressed it up as a CT op
when he realised we were
about to crucify him.
 Is that it?
 Thanks, Arnott, time's up.
 Don't act like this
hasn't happened before.
 Our operation was botched.
And you're trying to cover it up.
 The only person not telling
the truth is you.
 You're out on a limb, Arnott.
 Not a great place to be
when the inquest opens next week.
No wonder you're desperate.
 You asked me to lie, sir,
to go along with it.
 At least have the common decency
to admit that.
 I did no such thing.
 I got shafted because of you!
 Because I won't cover up our blokes
busting into the wrong flat,
 shooting an innocent person.
 See you at the inquest.
 This isn't going to work.
I can't use this on Gates.
 Steve. You're off the case.
Just wait!
 There's a bigger crime here.
 Gates believes he can bring
in a high-value offender
within organised crime.
 What? He told you that?
He's desperate.
 He believes it's his only chance
to save his career,
his reputation, his family.
 Look, DI Buckells' team's been
checking phone records.
 I can feed information to Gates.
He has a relationship there. They'll
want to meet, if only to kill him.
 Gates can pick up
an unregistered phone
 so he can make contact without being
traced by Buckells...
 Whoah, whoah! Hang on a second.
What are you saying?
You're going to cut this guy loose?
 After all this, the only way I'm
going to sanction an operation
 like this, son, is if you can
promise me that you're going to
deliver Gates
 right into the palm of my hand.
 This is the call history
from Ryan's phone.
 It goes back only a couple of days,
from when the handset was stolen.
 Now, there's a pattern
of incoming calls,
 always from different numbers.
 Having lost Ryan,
there's a big chance right now Tommy
 doesn't know
which of his numbers is secure.
 All the numbers are
currently inactive.
 Hastings is on standby to move
as soon as one joins the network.
 So are we.
 You're not coming in.
 I can't be seen
out here on the doorstep.
 Hey, please, Jools.
 I'm doing everything
to make us good again.
I promise you, I'm doing everything.
 But work are calling me back in.
 Are my girls in there?
 I don't want you upsetting them.
 Just an hour.
 Just so it's like we're
a family again.
 Just an hour, please?
 Please.
 What's the time, Mr Wolf?
 Three o'clock.
 What's the time, Mr Wolf?
 Ten o'clock.
 What's the time, Mr Wolf?
 Dinner time!
 DC Fleming.
 One of the numbers from
Ryan's phone just got activated.
They're triangulating now.
 Yeah, good, off you go,
both of you, go on.
 Yes, standing by.
Positions, everybody, come on.
 Go on, then.
 What's the time, Mister Wolf?
 Yeah? It's on.
 Gates?
 Received.
 Guys?
 I'm going to have to go. Why?
 I have got to go back to work.
 Have they got the triangulation yet?
 They've got a signal
in the Kingsgate, heading west
 'towards Edge Park.
It's got to be Tommy.'
 En route.
We've got a signal in Kingsgate.
 Heading west towards Edge Park.
 This is Gates. I'm a minute away.
 What are we?
 Two. Shit. What?
 I don't trust him, OK?
I don't bloody trust him!
 Tommy's travelling very fast.
Now going west on Kingsgate Road.
 Kingsgate Road, west.
 Received.
 He's already jumped to the next
cell. He's going like the clappers.
 God knows how,
but he must be on to us.
 Gates. Bastard!
 Tracking Tommy, 9301...
 He's just taken a left,
Edge Park Road, southbound.
 Drop him. This is our op.
 Drop him and he's gone. So's Tommy.
 Left turn. Edge Park Road.
 Received.
 The target's just
turned west again.
 He's leading us round
the bloody houses!
 We're now southbound
on Edge Park Road.
 Target is now heading west.
Look for a right turn ahead.
 Tracking Gates. 93016,
macro cell...
 He's stationary.
About 200 yards from the turn.
 'He's gone off road.
200 yards from the turn.'
 He's reached wherever he's going.
Or he's dumped the phone.
 Cutting it fine, Tom! >
Sorry.
 Just move it.
Can you get me a trolley handle?
 And a Kit-Kat?
Or a Mars bar, or something?
 Yeah... You cheeky bugger!
 Gates, report. Where are you,
what's happening?
 'Gates!'
 Gates!
 After the hammering you took last
week, we thought you'd be a no-show.
 Ha ha. I'll win my money back.
 Oh, right, thank you. Good on you.
 What's your problem, mate?
 It's all right, we're fine.
 Let's go out onto the tee.
 What?
 That's for my kids' dog.
 Back off! Now. Go.
 Let's go.
 Right turn, coming up.
 Move! Move!
 Now visual, in pursuit.
 'Look, where are you taking me?'
 D'you want to know the longest
anyone's ever managed to
 hold me in a police station?
 'I'm not arresting you.
I didn't kill Jackie Laverty.'
 The only evidence they'll
find on her is from you,
 you and your dirty business,
 plus the knife with your prints
all over it.
 When I was with her,
she was still alive.
 I wouldn't know. I wasn't there.
 No but your boys were, weren't they?
 And did they make her suffer?
Did they have their fun with her?
 You've got a dirty mind.
My boys are professionals.
 Bullshit. Probably under orders not
to tamper with the evidence.
 What orders would those be?
 Listen, you used her to get to me,
didn't you?
 It's an interesting story, eh?
 'Unfortunately, I'm not in a
position to either confirm or deny.'
 Oh, Christ.
 Listen, she was my girlfriend
and I cared about her.
 I just want to know what
you did to her.
 Spare yourself.
 Your life's
miserable enough already.
 Oh, you bloody didn't.
 'You did Greek Lane
and you did Wesley Duke.
 'My squad is starting to put it
together right now.'
 And every piece of evidence,
 every piece is starting to
point towards you.
 What evidence?
 'Well, there's me for a start.'
 A copper inside
is bad and bad enough.
 But you'll be a copper that grassed.
 That's why I want to stay out.
 I want that more than anything.
 What is this evidence
you're talking about?
 Oh, we're going to get to that.
 First, I want to make things
straight between me and you.
 Well, there has to be
something in it for me.
 The kid. Ryan.
He's young enough to turn.
 No one's daft enough to grass on me.
 Anticorruption can't make a case
against me without informants.
 What with that DS you gave us?
 'You mean Arnott?
 'I've fixed him.
I fixed him my way.'
 I couldn't be a part of killing him,
but all the rest is fine.
 Listen, I can still be of
use to you.
 You're dreaming. Am I?
 I dressed up
Greek Lane as something else.
 And I'm gonna make
Wesley Duke's murder look like
 a tear-up between some
low-level dealers.
 So if Jackie's body's never found,
then there's no case to answer.
 'For either of us.'
 He's played us again!
I'm calling in back-up.
 Let's get the pair of them
while we can. No. Wait.
 Steve! Wait.
 'The only problem is the fingers.'
 I don't know what you're
talking about. Drop the act.
 The amputated fingers are the only
link between Wesley Duke
 and Greek Lane.
 'It was clumsy and ignorant. You
said your boys are professionals.
 'That means it
was your bloody stupid idea.
 'They got carried away.
Bloody idiots.'
 Come on, Gates, nail the bastard.
 So I make Wesley Duke's murder
look like a copycat.
 But there's no forensics,
so they are gonna need a confession.
 Your boys screwed up,
make one of them cop for it.
 Triple murder hanging round your
neck. And I need a decision.
 'I know the toe rag
that'll take the fall.
 'He's gonna need to know chapter
and verse.' 'He will.'
 Tommy, I am risking
my neck for you here,
 I'm gonna need more than that, mate.
 He was there. He did it.
 I can't carry this off
if he's a nut job.
 'He'd better be able to
take orders.'
 He will if I give 'em.
Hey stop pissing me around.
 I need a simple answer,
to a simple question and
we're running out of time.
 For fuck's sake!
He killed him, on my orders.
 'Good enough for you?!'
 Yes!
 Good, so what d'you want in return?
 I want Jackie's body up in smoke.
 Problem is, she's my leverage.
How about this as Plan A?
 You do as you're told and
if you ever choose to not play ball,
 my boys unload Jackie's body
and you go down for her murder.
 Now, turn this thing around,
there's a good lad.
 I can still make the second tee.
 I said, turn it around!
 You bent bastard.
 Yeah, you heard me.
You bent bastard.
 What's happening?
What are they doing?
 Gates. There's no way out for him.
 You're under arrest for the
double murder at Greek Lane.
 For the murder of Wesley Duke.
 For the murder of Jacqueline Laverty
 and you do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence
 if you do not mention when
questioned something you
later rely on in court.
 And anything that you do say may
be given in evidence.
 I'll hold him.
Back-up's seconds away.
 Just go. Run.
 Run where?
 It's over. We got him.
 My wife and my girls get nothing
unless this is in the line of duty.
 That's what you owe me.
This and nothing else.
 Do you understand?
 It's for my family.
 I was never bent.
 You know that, don't ya?
 Gates! Gates!
 As you were.
 How'd it happen?
 DCI Gates was running through
traffic to apprehend the suspect.
 Line of duty, sir.
 I should inform his wife.
 Thank you, sir.
 Well done, you two. Well done.
 Thank you, sir.
 Thank you, sir.
 Sir, do you mind
if I get a minute with him?
 Just a couple of things
that might help us
 with the Greek Lane op,
non-evidential, obviously.
 Yeah, no problem.
 I hear you won't be calling me
Sir for much longer.
 Congratulations, Dot.
 Thanks.
 DS Cottan. Do you mind if I use the
back of your van for a minute?
 This way please, sir.
 I hope you've got some good
advice on how to play this hole.
 Well, the top brass think
the Greek Lane lads were
involved with Al-Qaeda.
 So you just play along with it,
in return for immunity.
 Huh.
 Huh.
 Best caddy I've ever had, son.
 I owe you a pint, Sir.
 Hello.
 I swear to tell the truth,
 the whole truth,
 and nothing but the truth.
