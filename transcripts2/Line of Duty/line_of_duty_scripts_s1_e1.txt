 'Units en route.
Flat 56, Regal Court.'
 'Silver Command, copy.'
 'Bronze Command same, Southern 156?'
 Southern 156, copy.
 'Forward units on foot.'
 Southern 156, copy.
 'I have Alpha team coming in low,
Bravo team high.'
 'Southern 156, copy that.'
 Bravo over looking,
moving into position.
 'Waiting on Gold. Order imminent.'
 Southern 156 standing by.
Bravo seconds away.
 'Alpha, sit rep.'
 We're in, going up.
 Alpha in the building.
 ETA less than a minute.
We need a decision.
 Southern 156,
still waiting on the order.
 'Fifth floor.'
 Southern 156,
Bravo, are you visual?
 Negative.
 Where's that bloody order?
 'Southern 156, Gold has signed off
on Health and Safety.
 'We need you to complete the Risk
Assessment. We need that paperwork.'
 It's done.
 'Fahrenheit.'
 Could you repeat Fahrenheit?
 'Fahrenheit.'
 What the hell, where's the...?
 Just go, flat 56. Flat 56.
 He's armed.
 All units, shots fired, shots fired.
 Get down, don't move!
 Jesus Christ! There's no bomb, Col!
There's no bloody bomb!
 With me, now!
 It's clear, Sarge.
 Come on.
 You got to the flat. You shouted,
"Armed police."
 You heard something going on inside,
a struggle, a fight or something.
 Southern 156 gave you
the order to go in.
 The suspect's there,
he's acting aggressive.
 You shout,
"Surrender, armed police."
 The suspect doesn't comply.
He comes for you.
 You've got no choice.
 I've got kids of my own, sir.
If I could do anything different...
 I want those statements
copper-plated by noon. Got it?
 Yes, sir.
 I take pride in the courage and
professionalism
 of my counterterrorism officers.
 To say any more risks prejudicing
the inquest. Thank you.
 When Karim Ali came to this country,
 he told his wife that here
it would be different.
 The police don't break into
houses and hurt innocent people.
 He told her that in England
the police are good men.
 This is a complex and emotive case.
 Following depositions from
legal representatives,
 I grant a period of six weeks
 to gather all relevant evidence
and statements.
 This inquest is hereby adjourned.
 All rise for Her Majesty's Coroner.
 What the bloody hell is this?
 They misread the number on the door.
 They mistook a baby sling
for a bomb harness.
 I ordered that you corroborate that
the firearms squad observed
threatening behaviour.
 We watched the flat for two weeks,
then got scrambled with
an hour's notice.
 The op was well planned and executed.
It was a runaway train.
 Admit our mistake, apologise
 and get on with the job of finding
the actual terrorists.
 You're blaming your own.
 It took guts for them to go in there
thinking a suicide bomber
 was going to blow them to pieces.
 Then write the same statement
they did.
 An innocent man was killed, sir,
I won't lie.
 You passed on the order. Where were
your reservations when it mattered?
 You're finished.
 'You passed on the order.'
 'Where were your reservations
when it mattered?'
 'You're finished.'
 Is it Steven or Steve?
 Steve. Thanks for accepting
the offer, Steve.
 Welcome to Anticorruption.
As you can see,
 we've got a number of active
investigations at present.
 Why are there empty desks?
 You should look at this
as a promotion, Steve.
 If you want to get
anywhere in the job these days,
 Anticorruption's a big tick
on the old CV.
 This will be good for me.
 That's the ticket.
 Your shooting...
 have you any idea how many people
have died as a direct result
 of police action in the last
ten years, Steve?
 No, I don't.
 Well, as with all firearms incidents
it's gone upstairs to the IPCC.
 But Karim Ali,
the man who was accidentally killed,
 he's an illegal immigrant.
 So is his missus.
 It wasn't your fault, son.
 A clean break. Pastures new.
 Come on.
 I've a very special case for you.
 'Hello.'
 Hey, it's me. I'm on my way.
 I will be there in five minutes,
I promise.
 'OK.'
 Woah. Plod. Better make that ten.
 I brought my business trip
forward to today.
 I'm sorry about tonight. No...
 It's your night. Only the most
glamorous night of the year.
 Yeah. Hardly.
 What are you going to do
to make it up to me?
 Fancy a bacon bap?
 Next you'll be trying to get me on
the back seat of your Ford Capri.
 And those were the days, eh?
God, I miss that car.
 I'll call you if I get back before
it's too late. OK.
 I think...
 we could just dash back to yours
before you have to go.
 Tony...
 Help! Help!
 Hey. Hey.
 You OK, darling?
 You OK? Stay there!
 Is the baby OK? Yeah.
The police are coming.
 They're already here.
 On the house.
 Thank you.
 Officer of the year
Detective Chief Inspector...
 Anthony Gates.
 Tony Gates returns the best
crime figures in the Job.
 No-one's that good.
What's his secret, Steve?
 He'll be after your job next, Derek.
Or yours, sir!
 Oh, I don't think so. I think I've
reached my level, sir.
 Any higher and I'll actually have to
read those Home Office e-mails, eh?
 Would you excuse me, please? Sir.
 Jackie.
 Hey, hey, hey, calm down.
 What's going on?
 Tony, thank God.
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry I've ruined
your night,
 I'm really sorry... Hey, hey.
 No, no, we are going to be calm
and clear-headed
 and then maybe I'll be able
to help you.
 As soon as we agreed the deal,
 someone cracked open
a bottle of champagne.
 OK, how much did you have?
 We went on to a wine bar...
 Oh, Christ, Jackie.
 I've been a bloody idiot.
 Just tell me what happened?
 I hit something.
 What?
 The road was dark, I don't know,
 I thought it was a sign or
a bollard or something...
 Jackie, what did you hit?
 A dog.
 A...a dog? Yeah.
 You'll be fine.
 People round here,
they report everything.
 What if someone saw my car?
I'm known.
 You're overreacting, that's all.
 I was drinking all night...
 the bar staff,
they saw what I was putting away.
 Where's your car?
 Tony. I've already got
a conviction for drink driving.
 One more and I go to prison.
 Where's your car?
 I called you.
And you didn't answer...
 Jackie!
 I reported it stolen.
 It's an 80-grand motor with
an immobiliser, Jackie.
 They'd need the keys.
Where are the keys?
 I'm sorry, I... I panicked.
 Where are the keys?!
 I don't know... Here.
 OK.
 What are you going to do?
 Thank you.
 Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.
That's OK.
 How'd it go?
 It was brilliant.
 I'm so proud of you.
 Mr Butterfield. I'm Detective
Constable Kate Fleming, Central CID.
 Oh. Pleased to meet you.
 First let me say how bad I feel
for what's happened to you.
 It must have been a very frightening
experience. How are you feeling?
 Well, I... I just want
something done.
 It'd really help us
empathise with your experience, sir,
 if we heard it firsthand.
 What? Well, I came in today
because I thought you'd...
 you'd made some progress.
 I'm sorry, Mr Butterfield,
but unless we have
 hard physical evidence that leads to
an offender, it's very difficult...
 Well, I've been burgled three times
this year already.
 Every time, it's someone new,
who's been given the file
 and who wants to "empathise"
all over again.
 Mr Butterfield, just wait.
 If you can just take my number,
you can call me day or night.
 Let's see what we can do
to get them this time.
 Yeah. Thank you.
 DC Kate Fleming to see you, sir.
 Thank you.
 You wanted to see me, sir?
 Er, there's a crime number,
 DCI Gates' double-arrest outside
a cafe in Kingsgate.
 Yeah, I processed the arrests, sir.
 Robbery, assault with weapon
with intent to rob,
 possession of prohibited weapon,
resisting arrest, all times-two.
 Yes, sir.
 Two offenders, but only one knife.
 You see my point, Kate?
 They didn't both use a knife.
There was an opportunity here
 with one of the offenders
to miss out the knife altogether.
 Well, I took the view
they were both involved, sir.
 Divisional commanders are on notice
to reduce knife crime.
 They say Hillside Lane have
already achieved 5%.
 Do you want me to re-crime it, sir?
 It's not my policy to intercede
in individual offences.
 Now, CID has an unacceptable
detection rate. Your case
this morning is a prime example.
 Multiple domestic burglaries?
 We pursue two out of three
reported crimes.
 We down-process anything that won't
quickly lead to an offender.
 Are you ordering me
to put it on the back-burner?
 You're not the new girl
any more, Kate.
 Thank you, sir.
 Officer of the Year isn't good
enough for the boss. He's after
the middleweight title.
 I heard they gave you more than
a free breakfast.
 Steady there, son.
 Ta, Deepak. Down here, mate.
Right, cheers, mate.
 Right, ABH. Alcoholic IP...
 Uh-huh!
 Oh, can't remember a thing about the
offender except he might've been
called Pete. Brilliant.
 No other witnesses. Twist.
 Er, car-jacking.
 CCTV showing registration plates,
reliable witnesses.
 That's aggravated vehicle-taking,
going equipped to steal,
 causing danger to other road users,
criminal damage, affray
 and putting people in fear
of violence.
 Full house, boss. Nice one. Stick.
 Er, yeah.
 DOA found early this morning
by dog-walker, side of the road.
 Bound to be a hit-and-run.
Turf it to Traffic, boss? Yeah.
 Where was the body found?
 Er... Edge Park.
 Back road off Millionaires' Row.
 Twist it.
 Is that it?
 Yeah, for now.
 OK.
 There was a Range Rover
abandoned in a lay-by
 about half a mile down the road.
 The owner reported it stolen
last night.
 Signs at the property suggest
they put a rod through the window
 to fish up the keys.
 Witnesses? CCTV?
 Not a dicky-bird, sir.
Just this woman walking her dog.
 What about the DOA?
 No ID on his body.
 Any reason for the interest, sir?
 We just got a tip-off that it
might be connected to
one of our investigations.
 What's wrong? What is it?
 You didn't kill a dog, Jackie.
 You killed a man.
 Oh, God.
 Oh, my God.
 You just go to the police. You
tell 'em exactly what you told me.
 No, Tony, I can't...
 Oh, yes, you bloody can.
Jackie, a man is dead, and that is
a big problem
 but trying to cover it up
is an even bigger one.
 Do you understand me?
 Jackie, have you got it?
 Yes, yes! OK, so you tell
the fewest lies possible.
 You say that you panicked
but now you want to come clean.
 You got it? Jackie, have you got it?
 OK.
 Don't call me, and don't bottle it.
 I've put the case where
I can keep an eye on it.
 So, yeah, should be good...
 Hang on, just give me a second,
Steve, all right?
 Hello, yeah.
 You all right? DS Arnott.
 Can I help you?
 Er, we're here to see
DCI Gates... Kate.
 OK. Erm, have you been posted?
 You could say that.
 Well, welcome to the Alamo.
 Thank you very much.
 They said they were getting
this fixed.
 Sorry about that, Steve.
 No problem.
 Are you with AC-12?
 Yeah.
 Hmm.
 Sir.
 Sir?
 AC-12 are in the building.
Hastings and some snot-nosed DS.
 Has a complaint been made
against one of my squad?
 I'm afraid it's you personally,
Tony.
 Huh.
 Any idea why?
 No, none at all, sir.
 They'll call you in.
 Thank you, sir.
 Can I get someone to bring you
a tea or coffee, sir?
 No, thank you, I'm fine.
 DCI Gates. Superintendent Hastings.
Like the battle.
 I know who you are, sir.
 And this is DS Steve Arnott.
 Pleased to meet you, sir. Likewise.
 I recognise and respect
the importance of your mission
 and I'm very happy to help you
in any way I can.
 Well, now, that's very reassuring.
Can I call you Tony?
 Whatever you feel
most comfortable with, sir.
 Maybe I should call you
Officer of the Year, eh?
 Shall we make a start?
 Yes, please.
 AC-12 interview.
 Present - Superintendent Hastings,
DS Arnott and DCI Gates.
 Detective Chief Inspector Gates,
 we have received an allegation that
you received a gratuity
 in respect of one free breakfast
from the Sunflower Cafe in
St Anne's Place, in the Kingsgate.
 Now, whilst receiving a gratuity
is not in itself a breach,
 failure to declare a said gratuity
is a breach
 of the police officer's
code of conduct as laid down
 by the Home Office guidelines.
 And so therefore I am serving you
with the yellow notice.
 And that's it?
 Yes, that's it.
 In which case, erm, I decline to
make any written or oral statement
 but I acknowledge
the receipt of the yellow notice
 and I inform the investigating
officer that I will respond within
the regulation ten working days.
 Interview terminated.
 This is coming from the muggers,
isn't it? Those toe-rags know
every trick in the book.
 Er, well, we have to go through
the motions, Tony, you know.
 It's not your fault, sir.
 He's an arrogant so-and-so,
isn't he?
 I mean, a player like Gates knows
it's against rules and regulations
not to declare a gratuity
 so what does it say about him
that he doesn't even bother his arse
to fill in the form?
 Well, with respect, what's a free
breakfast got to do with
 investigating Gates' crime figures?
 Sooner or later he's going to know
we're on to him. This way, he thinks
it's just a storm in a teacup.
 Or should that be a coffee cup?
 I'll give him laughing all over
his face at us. His guard's down.
 That's how we're going to
get him, Steve.
 There's another possibility.
 Yeah?
 Gates' figures are for real.
 Oh, I see what you're getting at.
 You think he's Bob Beamon and
I think he's, what, Ben Johnson?
 I mean, admittedly an athlete does
come along once in a while
 who breaks the world record
by a mile.
 And sometimes he's genuinely
superhuman but I will lay you odds
 all day long that more often
than not, that guy is a cheat.
 Sir...
 DCI Gates appears to be
an exemplary officer.
 Appears to be.
 My point exactly.
 Sorry.
 Hit-and-run?
 Why us?
 Because we've got a big sign
over our heads saying,
"CID, dump your crap here"?
 We've got ten unsolved burglaries
stinking up our figures.
 Give the hit-and-run to the civvy.
 She's had the training.
Anyway, I'm out of here.
 Gates' has been given
a written warning
 about his team's gender balance.
I'm a shoe-in.
 If you would just like to take
a seat, please, Ms Laverty.
 There we are. Sorry about that.
 You are Jacqueline Laverty, date of
birth 23rd of November 1967?
 Yeah.
 Right person. That's a good start.
 We don't have your occupation listed.
 I run my own business.
 Laverty Holdings. You could just
put down "self-employed".
 I'm sorry,
are you one of the detectives
 looking into the theft of my car?
 I carry out some forms of police work
but I'm not a police officer.
 Cut-backs.
 You reported your car stolen
at 10.06pm,
 the night before it was found
abandoned?
 I got back from a business
trip around 9.00
 and I later remembered I'd left
something in the car.
 When I went to get the keys,
 they were gone and they'd broken
part of the window in my front door.
 They hooked the keys from
the hall table.
 You didn't hear anything?
 I was in a back room,
with music playing.
 What the hell are you playing at?
 The woman seemed so convinced.
She made it impossible to
change the story.
 You don't change, do you?
 You're just always looking after
number one.
 No, no, no, Tony, no. I'll fix this.
 I will. I'll find a way.
Yeah, like you did today?
 I'll take the blame.
 I'll go to prison
if that's what you want.
 Not so bad. This'll cheer you up.
 Maybe this wasn't the best place
to come.
 Not at all, not at all. Young
fellow like yourself. New in town.
 You get yourself a girlfriend, eh?
 Hm.
 I haven't put my big
un-PC foot in it, have I?
 No, no, I'm straight.
 Two pints of larger, please.
 Hiya.
 Good evening. Daddy! Daddy!
 Whoa! Hey! Wow!
That's a great welcome.
 I got an A in piano today.
Do you want to hear?
 Sweetheart, Dad's just walked
in the door.
 Hi. I really don't mind.
 Kate.
 DS Arnott. Even in AC we have
first names. Steve.
 Right.
 We seem to have got off
on the wrong foot.
 Oh, maybe we should get to know
each other better, then, over
a pizza and a glass of Rioja. Sorry.
 Look... Tony Gates is
the best detective in this city.
 He saved a mum from being mugged at
knifepoint and you lot have stuck him
 for forgetting to fill in
the right bloody form.
 I mean, maybe there's more to you but
so far that's all I've seen.
 Good morning, sir.
 Sir, wait. Sir, listen.
 I can have a harassment charge
thrown down just like that, son.
 A minute of your time. Please.
Some of us have proper work to do.
 Look, I can't believe
you're stuck on for this.
 Hastings gives a toss about you
having a free egg and bacon.
 I don't. I just want to make
the yellow notice go away
 so we can both get on with
investigating real crime.
 Hastings has got you playing
mind games, son.
 A few weeks ago I was running
counter-terror ops.
 I'm a proper copper
and I know another when I see one.
 And you think you can
make Hastings back off?
 I can certainly try, sir.
Off the record.
 Well, that won't be easy, mate,
cos the man's a zealot.
 Don't I bloody know it!
 Why didn't you
log the gratuity, sir?
 I forgot.
 Yeah, I know it was a crap excuse.
 But it's the truth.
 Rita, isn't it? Sir?
 I'm DCI Gates.
 I know who you are, sir!
 There's, erm, a hit and run,
Rita... Oh, yes, sir.
 I'm still trying to match the victim
to the missing persons report.
 Well, it might connect to something
that my team are looking into.
 So if you get anywhere, you'll come
straight to me, won't you?
 No-one else?
 Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely.
You're a star, Rita.
 Come in.
 Sorry to bother you, sir.
 Not a problem.
 I thought you should know I've been
looking back over the arrest reports
 over the last couple of days.
 I've noticed an upsurge
in Class A detections on the Bog.
 Thanks for the tip.
It's Fleming, isn't it?
 Yeah.
 It's good work.
 I want to join TO-20 sir.
 Anyone with any sense
would steer clear right now.
 AC-12? You'll piss
all over them, sir.
 I'm sick of CID, sir.
 We get all the crap that no-one
else wants. I'm better than that.
 I want to be on the squad.
 Join the queue. Well, check out
my CV. I've got five years.
 I've been kicked, punched,
spat on, pissed on...
 but, my social life aside...
 Every week it's a new initiative
or a new audit.
 I want to work for a unit that
actually fights crime.
 The big part of the job
description is surveillance.
 Yeah.
 Well, men are gonna notice you.
 What, and women don't notice you?
 Come for a drink this week.
 It's not a date.
 You're breaking my heart, sir.
 It'll just be a good way for you to
get to know the lads a bit. And...?
 And then we'll see.
 Yeah. OK, thanks.
 What the bloody hell was that?
 Nothing.
 I'm next in line for a squad.
Yeah, if you say so, Leah.
 I'm one-quarter Romany.
 Steve.
 The very man. So what can you
tell me about Tony Gates?
 Uh...
 Er, nothing? Oh, come on, Steve.
What can I say?
 I'm disappointed.
 Sir, I'm committed to
Anticorruption 100%...
 That's what I need to know, son.
Come on.
 One of our team has made
a breakthrough.
 What's going on, sir?
 All will be revealed, Steve,
all will be revealed.
 Alice, what a pleasant surprise.
I'll have to be on my toes today.
 You've always been
a lovely mover, sir.
 Tony, make yourself at home.
 I was surprised to be called back so
quickly, sir. I hope it's good news.
 AC-12 interview with
DCI Gates,
 Police Federation representation
DCI Alice Prior.
 I've been authorised to notify you
that we have grounds to widen
 our investigation into DCI Gates'
performance of professional duties.
 Widen the investigation? What?
 We have grounds under Professional
Duties and General Conduct.
 Specifically
in the practice of laddering.
 Which is the amplification, indeed,
the multiplication of charges
 against an offender...
I know what laddering is, sir.
 That's right, Tony.
You do. Here's the yellow notice.
 You've got the regulation ten days.
 DCI Gates strenuously denies
any wrongdoing.
 Nevertheless he offers the
investigation his full cooperation.
 Thank you. That's much appreciated.
I'd like to determine the conditions
of Tony's suspension.
 Oh, no, we're not asking for
a suspension at this time.
 We don't think he's a threat
to his fellow officers or indeed
 the public in general.
 Now, why should the citizens of this
country be denied
 his selfless service?
 Interview terminated.
 That's very generous of you, sir.
 Looks like you've
found your level, Arnott.
 Tony, let's not descend to...
Nobody plays me.
 Sir.
 You never detected the laddering
because you didn't even look.
 I recruited you because you took a
moral stand against your colleagues,
 despite the personal cost.
 You're a born AC-12 officer.
Why don't you start acting like one?
 You've dropped me
into an ongoing investigation.
 Now, you could test me
or you could actually brief me.
 OK. Tony Gates cherry-picks
the crimes that are easy to solve,
 then he dumps the rest.
 Then he invents a whole series
of additional charges
 that never make it to the courtroom
but boost his clean-up rates.
 Laddering. That's how Tony Gates
got where he is. No. He had to be
twice as good to get to there.
 What? So what are you saying? To be
corrupt he's got to be twice as bad?
 No, sir, victimisation
of a black officer...
 Oh, now, hang on a second.
 Don't you talk to me about
victimisation. What are you saying?
 Let me tell you something, son.
 Me and my best mate, we went through
basic training together, OK.
 First year out, they sent us on this
particular job.
The two Catholics, are you with me?
 We go straight over a pipe bomb.
I end up in intensive care,
him they bury.
 The Log Book goes missing,
nobody says a word.
 Don't you talk to me
about victimisation.
 Nobody's blacker than me, son!
 Kate! Hi, all right?
 Like the look of the recruitment
policy. Hey, nothing sexist.
 Oh? I'm off, then, good night.
 It's just HR will be down on me
like a ton of bricks.
 Big appointment for me, boys.
Yeah.
 Kate. Hi.
 DC Morton. Nige.
Yeah, all right?
 DS Matt Cottan. All right.
 Hi. Dot... Dot. Oh, OK.
 So Tone says you want to be
in with the in-crowd.
 The in-crowd? Where?
 Very good.
 I just want to work for the best,
sir. Oh, we're off duty now, Kate.
You can call me...
 Tina. Call him Tina.
 And last... And definitely least...
You met Deepak. Yep.
 I'm sorry, Kate, I didn't know
 whether you wanted a half or a pint,
so I just got you two halves.
 When you send a boy to do
a man's job. This is it.
 Thanks, Deepak.
 You're welcome.
 Oh, and I've got something
for you here, boss, as well.
 There you go! How about that?
 - Now, that is stuck on! Drink to that.
- Cheers!
 Thanks.
 Come with me.
 We're gonna get Gates
with or without you, Steve.
 So you can either help us,
 or be just another prick
who lost his bottle.
 It's your choice, son.
 I didn't know AC-12 used
undercover officers.
 Hence the term.
 You're the one that gave us
the information about the laddering.
 I'm on the inside at last, Steve.
 All this just to bring down Gates?
 Instead of spending all this
time and money policing the police,
 it'd make more sense to assign us
to cases that aren't being
investigated.
 TO-20's been nicknamed
the Big Sexy Crime Unit.
 Gates has been awarded the highest
budget three years running. His squad
has the best kit in the station.
 Meanwhile victims of crime miss out
on justice because he only tackles
cases that score points.
 Who doesn't? It's the system.
 I wouldn't be risking what
I'm risking if I didn't believe Gates
was a special case.
 I thought Anticorruption was about
getting blokes on the take,
 the ones in the pockets of
the criminals.
 You took a stand
and it put you out on your own.
 You're not on your own any more.
 Unless you want to be.
 Kate's been tracking arrests
on the Bog.
 Over the last month there's
been a three-fold increase
 in the supply and demand
of Class A narcotics.
 I've talked to the Fifth Floor.
 We've been given the go-ahead
for a surveillance op. We start...
 DCI Gates. DS Arnott,
can I help you?
 My car... That your doing?
 You shat on the boss.
 Yeah. Maybe someone just
returned the compliment.
 I want to talk to you alone. Now.
 Fire away.
 I thought maybe you were clean.
Looks like you're dirty, after all.
 You take a shot at the king,
make sure you kill him, son.
 "Fire away." That's priceless, boss.
 That's MasterCard.
 Which one of you muppets did it?
 I'm Spartacus.
 No, I'm Spartacus.
 Our old friend Wesley Duke,
with a big fat rucksack
full of crack cocaine.
 Now, when you was all tucked up
in your warm beds last night...
 You were tucked up with Dot.
 He's only jealous.
 Dot and me traced the source to
this address in Greek Lane.
 Now, Wesley's been small-time,
but this appears to be a new,
 large-scale supply he's tapped into.
 Next stage would be
to pick Wesley up and turn him.
 And what if he blabs?
We don't want to alert the Greek Lane
mob that we're watching them.
 That's a good point. Let's keep up
the surveillance for now, Nige.
 See who else comes and goes
from this address. Well done, matey.
 Erm, let it roll.
 Fleming. Yeah?
 I'm going to talk to the
Fifth Floor, get them to formally
approve your transfer to TO-20.
 Thanks, sir. I won't let you down.
 Any news?
 No, nothing.
 They're not suspicious?
 It's been filed as an unexplained
hit-and-run.
 That's good, isn't it?
 I shouldn't... I shouldn't be here.
 But you are.
 I have it on good authority that it
was Gates, himself,
 who soiled your car.
 Deepak...
 OK... Cheers, mate.
 Next turn's on the way, Dot.
 They're pulling us off
for the night.
 Pulling us off?
 Ah, best thing I got at
Hillside Lane was a pint after work.
 Right, come on.
 Shall we wait for the next turn
at least?
 Come on, you've had
the memo about overtime, Deepak.
 They'll be here in ten minutes.
Make a move.
 Excuse me, please. Thank you.
 Morning, sir.
 Let's get the pond life moved
much further away
 and they'll soon go back to
watching Jeremy Kyle. Yes, sir.
 See all these kids, get them
back in school,
 unless they're being excluded.
 Can you move back, please.
 Christ's sake, Dot.
 How many times, mate?
 It was ten minutes, 15 tops
before the next turn clocked on.
 Damned if you do,
damned if you don't in this job.
 Morning, boss.
 Tone, I don't know what to say,
mate...
 Later, Dot, all right?
 From the blood spatter,
both men were alive
when the fingers were amputated.
 Looks like whoever killed them
wanted to know something
 and didn't find out.
 The finger amputations are clean.
 Each one done with a single stroke.
Most likely...
 bolt-cutter.
 Dot, I want you to go through
the files back at the station,
 see if there's a similar MO here
 or at any other force's
case history. Right, OK.
 Nigel, I want entry control
front and back, all the dabs
in the downstairs rooms
 and, if there's
a bathroom upstairs, there too.
 And when forensics have got
all their samples,
 I want you to go through everything.
 Let's find out who these two boys
were, please.
 Aye-aye, skipper.
 Fleming, you do the door-to-door.
 You see what
I've bloody got to deal with.
 We're trying to get a job done here
and some pen pusher bans overtime.
 There were 15 minutes for someone
to break in.
 The lads in there are
the new kids on the block.
 And someone doesn't want them
muscling in on their territory.
 You not tempted to dump this one
on CID, sir?
 No chance. It's big.
 It's sexy. And that makes it mine.
 What goes around comes around.
 Mr Butterfield, I'm so sorry.
 Yeah. This time I was home
when they broke in.
 Just give me a minute.
 He's going to make a complaint!
 Sir, with respect, you told me
to put the case on the back-burner.
 I told you to prioritise.
 This missing persons report
came through from County CID.
 Mr Gurjit Patel. Reported missing
the day after the hit and run.
 Mr Patel was an accountant
for Laverty Holdings.
 Laverty Holdings is owned
by Jacqueline Laverty,
 the woman whose vehicle was
reported stolen.
 He was her accountant when...
Thank you, Rita.
 My squad is going to be taking over
this case from now on.
 And you can leave it to me to tell
County that we've got an ID.
 This is a very sensitive case, Rita,
 so I'm going to need to shoot
those files over to my computer.
 May I?
 Yes, sir... of course.
 Thank you.
 Erm, milk, no sugar would be nice.
 Yes, right.
 You're a star.
