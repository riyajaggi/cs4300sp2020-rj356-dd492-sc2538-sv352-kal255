 Line of Duty (2012–…): Season 1, Episode 4 - Episode #1.4 - full transcript 
 Whilst the money laundering investigation is passed to Fraud Squad Gates is still hounded by his blackmailers. Kate wants to connect him to Jackie's murder and sets out to gain his trust to...

 Oi! I'm a policeman!
 I've been up all night weighing up
my career against helping you out.
 No, Kate, that's not what I...
You bastard, sir!
 So you're going to take all of us
down with you? Are you, sir?
 What was that about something
going down the drain?
 You all right?
That'll be your investigation.
 Our focus shifts completely
 to the double murder on Greek Lane
and the killing of Wesley Duke.
 Tony, you know DI Buckells has taken
over the Laverty disappearance?
Yeah.
 We're developing her
money laundering as a lead.
 If Gates had
solved the triple murder,
 he could have shaken off
these allegations.
 Now, he's a dead man walking.
 Why keep digging?
 He's here. Do you want
her body found with your
dirty business all over her?
 Right, er, Aidan, Kelvin,
I want you to focus
 on Jackie's links
to organised crime.
 Tina, Richie, we need to expand
the search for the body, yeah?
 Whoever we can connect to that body
is our prime suspect.
 DI Buckells, a word please.
 Now.
 Richie? You lot were crap
at the weekend.
 You need a new centre-half, mate.
 How's the, erm, money laundering
investigation coming?
 Still early days, sir.
 What do you know about
financial irregularities?
 Enough.
 It's a very specialised area,
you know.
 Nervous about something, sir?
 AC-12 have been trying
to stick me for weeks, son.
 If you think you can do better,
be my guest.
 You go after a fellow officer,
 you'll see how those lot
feel about you.
 My advice is to dump it
on Fraud Squad.
 Yeah?
 Phone.
 Bent bastard.
 Hello.
 What news?
 I told you to shut it down!
 Yeah, I am being watched. I can't
do that. Nobody could do that!
 I've done the next best thing.
 It's a complicated white-collar crime
 and the offender's
missing presumed dead.
 The CPS won't touch it
with a bargepole.
 They better not. For your sake.
 I've held up my side.
 I want Jackie's body and
the murder weapon disposed of now.
 Och, away! Hey!
 Hey!
 Glad you could make it.
 Sir, I want to call him.
I'm winding down the operation.
 Sir, please! Hilton said he
was willing to sideline Gates
so long as we back off.
 But that was before we lost Steve.
 Assign another officer.
 Haven't got the manpower, Kate.
I'm 10% down already on
my budget to Counterterrorism.
 Why throw good money after bad?
 Listen, we've got him
for what we wanted originally...
 professional conduct and general
duties. Laddering?
 We don't have him for perverting
the course of justice,
 for complicity
in murder and manslaughter.
 Listen, his career's over.
Job done. Right?
 I've spent months on this operation,
sir.
 I'm calling you in, Kate.
 No way, sir.
 I can nail him myself.
 Yeah?
 You wanted a statement from me.
 About the text message from Jackie
Laverty's phone to DCI Gates' phone.
 It's a dead end.
 Any other leads?
 I know what you're up to, Fleming.
 If DCI Gates wants any of this
he can put a request in writing,
via the Chief Super.
 Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
 Yeah?
 DI Buckells might be looking
into Jackie's money laundering.
 I know.
 Well, I'm worried
it might connect to you, sir.
 Well, it doesn't.
 Arnott was the problem.
 And now he's bottled it,
I can get back to doing my job.
 Well, that's great, sir.
 Nige, Dot, back to Greek Lane.
Work to do.
 I take it this means
I'm forgiven, Kate?
 Not quite, sir. I reckon you're
still short by a box of Milk Tray.
 Morning, sir.
 The search team's
completed operations.
 Fleming, Nige?
 What was the final forensic
report on the chemical residues?
 Traces of hydrogen
peroxide in the kitchen,
 in areas consistent
with household bleach.
 What about those Arabic books
we found?
 I'll chase up the translators, boss.
Thanks, Nige.
 Steady, Nige.
 So this is where you are.
 Poor bastard's been
in the morgue for weeks.
 Three post mortems.
 Wasn't your fault, Steve.
 I should have done more to challenge
the Fahrenheit order.
 He'd still be alive.
 Fleming's still out there, you know?
She's not given up.
 Yeah, well she can sit
in judgement on Gates.
 Who am I to?
 Well, that's a matter for
your own conscience, Steve.
 All I know is, because of you,
Kate's been left high and dry.
 Boss never bought me choccies.
 Yeah, you look
more like a flowers man, Dot.
 How long have you been married, sir?
 Just over ten years.
 And Jackie?
 Sorry.
 No, it's just not
going to sound very good.
 I'm not going to sit in judgement,
sir, if that's what you mean.
 "Sir."
 Come on, Kate, we're off duty.
 It'd feel weird calling you Tony.
 Why?
 Because you don't look like a Tony.
 Well, only my mum gets
to call me Anthony.
 Look, you're right, we don't
have to talk about difficult stuff.
 No, it's all right, it's...
 I knew her from years back.
 I didn't realise.
 Yeah, I was a DC.
 She was the estate agent that
showed me round my first flat.
 You're kidding.
 And when I moved in,
 I made this joke that
now she knows my address, and, erm...
 Afternoon, sir.
 How are you?
 A couple of nights later,
she knocked on my door.
 Then, six months down the line,
I'm doing the whole thing.
 I bought a ring, I'm down on one
knee in a restaurant like a mug.
 Then...
 she pissed off with a millionaire.
 I spent a couple of years
feeling sorry for myself,
 and then I met my Jools.
 Mrs Gates? Yeah.
 Then, out of the blue, Jackie's
back in town, newly divorced.
 What happened?
 It was like before.
 It was like that night
when I was alone in a bare flat
 and she came knocking.
 And now she's dead,
and it's probably because of me.
 Don't torture yourself.
 Look, I wanted to apologise.
 I should never have used you to help
flush out the rat in the squad.
 But I was backed into a corner...
 I was just pissed off
at being manipulated, sir.
 If you need my help, just ask.
 As Buckells goes through
Jackie's finances...
 there's going to be
a link to you, isn't there?
 No, there's not.
 I could make it disappear.
 How?
 Get to it before Buckells.
 No, sorry, Kate.
 Paranoid.
 I was missing the glamour.
 And the operation's been missing
a blunt instrument.
 Gates hinted there was a financial
connection from Jackie to him.
 Well, I studied his personal
finances, there was never anything.
 No exotic holidays,
no house in the country.
 If she cut him in on
the money laundering,
 God knows what he's spending it on.
 Same as anyone -
the thing he cares about most.
 She had no time to think about it
when it was happening,
 but now she wondered
if she hadn't just been worried
 about the expedition
losing its leader.
 Holding him in her flippers,
she found herself...
 imaging what it would be like
if Scott wasn't... I'll get it! OK.
 Nige! Come in.
 Hi, Jools, how you doing?
 Good.
I'm not interrupting anything, am I?
 All right, mate?
 Is there something wrong?
 No, I was just passing by.
 Wondered if you fancied coming
down the Arms for a swift pint?
 I would love to, mate, but...
 snowed under.
 Well, that's why I thought
you could do with a night off.
 Any other night.
 You're in the middle
of a shit storm, Tone.
 Why've you stopped talking to me?
 Of course I haven't.
 You're my best mate.
 Am I?
 Friday night.
 You, Mel, me, Jools,
we'll get a baby-sitter.
 We'll have a balti.
 Great.
 Yeah.
 I appreciate this, Nige.
 Right.
 Good night, Jools!
Night-night!
 Night, Natalie, night, Chloe!
Night-night!
 Good night, man. Yeah.
 What are the fees here,
if you don't mind me asking?
 £3,500.
 Per year?
 Per term.
 For new pupils, we also require
a deposit of £1,000 per pupil
 to secure a place,
with the first term paid in advance.
 And the Gates's had
no trouble meeting the cost?
 There was nothing improper.
 That's not what I asked.
 You'll understand our parents'
financial records are confidential.
 I'll be back with a court order.
I'll have to inform the Head.
 You don't tell anyone.
 OK?
 You were right. There's something.
 I push from the outside,
you push from the inside.
 Welcome back, Steve.
 Yeah.
 Buckells isn't the problem.
 Arnott's on the case again.
 He was at your daughters' school.
 Sir.
 Sir. Stop, sir!
 This is what he wants you to do.
 I'm not having it!
I'm not having it, Kate!
 As soon as I heard he was back
I got worried.
 I had uniform drive past your house
and your daughters' school.
 I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said anything. No.
 No, I...
 It's my girls.
 When they, erm,
got into their school,
 I got slapped
with a nine grand bill.
 I was trying to get
a loan to cover it,
 cos they were in danger
of losing their places.
 Jackie paid it without telling me.
 She said it was a gift.
 I should've said no.
 I should...
 My old man never did
anything for his kids
 and I swore I was
going to be different.
 Well, I'll keep tabs on Arnott.
 Whatever he finds,
you'll know about it.
 Thank you.
 All right?
 Jackie Laverty paid the deposit
 and first-term advance fees for
Gates' daughters at Edge Park Prep.
 Gates opened up to you?
 How did you...?
 You do your side, I'll do mine.
 Well, once we've gone
through the records,
 we'll have a financial trail
leading from organized crime
to Gates via Jackie.
 The same crew that killed
Jackie Laverty
 carried out the Greek Lane murders.
 Could Gates be involved
with them, too?
 Well, we should target Cottan.
 He was pulled off surveillance
the night of the murders.
 Well, isn't Cottan too tight
with Gates to give him up?
 I overheard a row between Cottan
and Morton about loyalty to Gates.
 Cottan was wavering, Morton made
a dig at Dot about ticking boxes.
 Sounded like a sensitive subject.
 Right.
 Well, for appearances,
we should bring in the whole squad,
 make the interviews
focus on laddering.
 Makes sense.
 You going to leave me
in the lurch again?
 I had a wobble.
 No more wobbles?
 No more wobbles.
 Good.
 No comment, sir. Oh, come on.
 DCI Gates ladders offences,
doesn't he, Morton? Hmm?
 I mean, that's how he's returned
the best performance indicators
in the last three years, right?
 No comment, sir.
 On the night that
Wesley Duke was murdered,
 DCI Gates failed to report for duty -
where was he?
 No comment, sir.
Oh, come on, you're his mate!
 Don't tell me you didn't try
and contact him? No comment, sir.
 You'd just got yourself
a triple murder.
 I mean, you can't seriously defend
Gates' conduct, can you, DC Morton?
 No comment, sir.
 We've built a very damning
case against him, Morton.
 Then you won't need to turn me, sir.
 When the bomb goes off...
 there'll be a hell of a lot
of collateral damage.
 I've been a DC for 20 years.
 I'll still be one when I retire.
 Ambitious blokes, like you,
 get buffeted by every
little wind of change.
 Me?
 Just keep sailing on.
 Interview terminated.
Go on, piss off!
 Thank you, sir. Pissing off, sir.
 Welcome back, DS Arnott.
 That's one down.
 Sir.
 Sir.
 I thought we had a deal, Ted.
 No, we had a discussion, sir.
 I had the whole thing planned.
 Restructuring of Tactical Ops,
TO-20 disbanded, Gates sidelined.
 My email is sitting
in the Chief Constable's inbox.
 The charge against Gates, sir,
that we discussed,
 is in respect of laddering.
 I have to substantiate
that allegation with some
pretty hard evidence,
 otherwise Gates is at liberty
to sue us for constructive dismissal.
 I appear to have misunderstood.
 Well, if that is my fault,
I apologise, sir.
 But I have to interview
all of Gates' team to ascertain
 whether he was working alone.
 Yes, of course!
 And was he?
 Well, I'm not at liberty
to say as yet, sir.
 I thought we were working
together on this, Ted.
 Yes, well, we are, sir, but I think
we'd both be gratified
 to know Gates is a lone gunman, sir,
 and not the product of
institutionalised malpractice...
 sir.
 Fleming?
 Sir, I thought you should know,
 we've all just been
called in by AC-12,
 me, Dot and Nige.
 What for?
 They're not saying,
but they've pulled in copies
 of all recent cases,
including the Greek Lane murders.
 DC Fleming? Sorry, sir.
 Fleming? Fleming?!
 What's your understanding
of the term "laddering"?
 I'll be guided by you, sir.
 Well, laddering is the amplification,
 indeed multiplication,
of charges against the offender
 for the purpose of securing
administrative detections.
 In short, it's the buffing up
of our figures
 to make it look like
more crimes are being solved.
 Does this ring any bells?
 You've got a nerve, sir.
 DCI Gates is the best
detective in this city.
 Why don't you do everyone a favour
and go after some proper criminals?
 That your statement, Fleming?
 It is, sir.
 Interview terminated.
 Off you go.
 DS Cottan - is it all right
if I call you Matthew?
 Fine by me, sir.
I know you also go by Dot.
 Matthew it is.
 Appearances can be deceptive,
Matthew, can't they?
 I mean, you look at DCI Gates and...
very admirable individual.
 Devoted family man.
Officer of the Year.
 I mean, you admire him,
don't you, Matthew?
 I respect him, sir.
I like the bloke a lot, yeah.
 And does he respect you?
I mean, does he like you?
 I don't really go round
thinking like that, sir.
 No. That's it. Emotional security.
I look at you and that's what I see.
 Yeah, a confident copper.
Someone who can handle himself.
 But like I said, you know,
appearances can be deceptive.
 You're the last person I'd look
at and think, "mental health issue".
 Hear you like the horses.
 I used to.
 In 2009, you were given
a final written warning
 for dereliction of duty.
 Why was that, Dot?
It's all in the file.
 You couldn't go past a bookie's
without dropping in.
 All-nighters at the casino.
Up to your eyes in debt.
 Your missus walked out.
 You had a breakdown.
 Yeah, well, I was an addict.
 What do they say?
Once an addict, always an addict?
 No, not everyone says that.
 DCI Gates doesn't.
 He scraped you off the bottom of the
barrel and put you on his squad.
 All that overtime,
you soon worked off those debts.
 That's right, yeah.
 Yeah, well there's one debt
you'll never work off.
 To Gates.
 And he knows it.
 And that's why
he counted on you, Matthew,
 to abandon the surveillance
operation in Greek Lane.
 Anything you say in here, Matthew,
 will be treated
with the strictest confidence.
 DS Raser says anything,
it's his career, I can assure you.
 We only want the truth.
 You were supposed
to be watching the house.
 Instead of waiting for the next turn,
you took an early swerve.
 Come on now, Matthew.
 Hmm? That's when the murders
took place.
 Look, we got a call saying
the next turn was on their way.
 We'd had notices about unnecessary
overtime. So we decided to go.
 Oh, WE decided, WE decided.
Who decided, Matthew?
 Huh?
 Did you decide, Matthew?
 A breach of procedure
that resulted in the untimely deaths
 of these two young men? What?
 Or did Gates order you to go,
 knowing whatever happened
you'd stick by him?
 There's two yellow notices
against your card already, son.
 One more strike and you're out.
No job. No pension.
 You owe Gates
for giving you a second chance.
 But you don't owe him your future.
 The red notice is only the start,
son.
 I'll go for the criminal conviction,
you know I will.
 You don't owe him
a cover-up for a double murder.
 It was Tony.
 He was the one that gave the order.
 Interview terminated.
 Thank you, Matthew.
We'll be in touch. Thank you.
 It all fits.
The gang that committed the Greek
Lane murders was laundering money
 via Jackie, money that was paying
for Gates' daughters' education.
 He facilitated the hit
to protect his income.
 I think we've got the bastard!
 I'll see you in the pub for a pint.
 Well, do yourself a favour, mate.
 What's the story?
 They're going after us for laddering.
They're coming after me, you mean.
 We're in this together, mate.
 The laddering could be a
smokescreen. You'd know, would you?
 There's something else
they have on me. What?
 It doesn't matter.
 She knows about it? Nige.
 Everyone knows
she's been stuck for a complaint,
 but AC-12 don't seem to give a toss.
 What's all that about?
 With all due modesty, they've got
bigger fish to fry.
 Their case against you started with
the free breakfast at the cafe.
Who wrote up the arrest report?
 Yeah, that's right. It was me.
 We all know the complaint
came from the muggers.
 Do we? Yes. Cut it out! Cut it out!
 Do you not see, Christ,
they're into me for everything.
 The laddering, the breakfast,
Jackie, fucking everything!
 Who are those bastards
to come after you, boss?
 They've forgot
what the job used to be.
 All the crap you took at Hendon.
 Jesus, Nige, what
the hell did you tell them?
 Boss...
 Mate, what do you think?
 No comment to everything.
 Kate?
 I told them where to stick it.
 Dot?
 No comment.
 You know me, Tone.
 Right.
 Nige, I'm sorry.
 It's just, I've got to think.
 It's late.
 Go home.
 Go home!
 Boss? All of you.
 Please.
 We're not open. What do you want?
 Remember me?
I'm here to search the premises.
 The lift stunk, blood.
 Yeah, of your farts, cuz.
 No, that's your mum. Every time
I do her, she gives me a kebab.
 Freezing our nuts off out there,
waste man. Sorry, Ryan.
 You don't mind us popping in,
do you, Terry? No.
 Home away from home, this is.
 Have you got a problem?
 I said, have you got a problem?
 Soz, mate. Couldn't remember
where the bog was, innit?
 I'm only messing about.
 Get off!
 He's looking at my tits.
I wasn't!
 Oi, look what the council give him!
Wish I was spasticated.
 Hey, Sammy, how are you?
 Hiya. Hey.
 The way you sounded on the phone,
 I didn't know what state
to expect you in.
 This trouble at work, Jools.
 It's pretty serious.
 How serious?
 There was a woman.
 Jackie, and she offered to help
with the girls' schooling.
 What? What woman?
 She's just somebody I met at work.
She's a businesswoman.
 Why would she want to do that?
She...
 Was there something
going on between you?
 No.
 Tony?
 I would never do that.
You know that.
 She just let on
she could pull strings
to get the girls into their school.
 But that all worked out fine.
 She paid the first set of fees.
 What? Listen, no listen, the girls
would've lost their places,
 and I couldn't have that.
 We didn't have the money,
so, she offered.
 I still don't get
why would she want to do that.
 To get me in her pocket.
 Is this why that anti-corruption
officer was round here?
 Yeah.
 You said you could fix it.
 I've tried. No. I've...
There's got to be something.
 Quickly, everyone, gather round.
 The Chief Constable has ordered me
to take personal charge
 of the operation
as Senior Investigating Officer.
 Owing to his familiarity with
the investigation,
 Deputy SIO will be DCI Gates.
 DCI Gates? Thank you, sir.
 Greek Lane's been under
investigation as the scene
 of a double homicide.
 The IP's were two IC6 males
in their 20s.
 There were Arabic books found at the
scene. They've been translated.
 They were chemistry manuals.
 Forensics also found evidence of
hydrogen peroxide use at the scene,
 and that's a well-recognised
chemical constituent of IEDs.
 Look, the evidence points very
strongly to these men
 being involved
in a terrorist operation.
 Now, at this point, we have no
clear understanding
 of why these men
were murdered or who by.
 But their involvement in terrorist
planning raises the possibility
 that they were killed for their
silence, and the wider terror group,
 of which these men formed a part,
poses a threat to the public.
 So the objectives
of our investigation
 are to work with counterterrorism
officers and the Security Services
 to uncover the infrastructure that
supported this cell
 and to prevent the remaining
elements from executing their plan.
 I want all inspectors and sergeants
to attend an operational overview
 in the Briefing Room with me.
That's it, sir.
 Thank you, DCI Gates.
Thank you, everybody.
 This is bollocks and you know it.
 You screwed up the op,
you killed an innocent man
 and now the real terrorists
are at large.
 I'm just tidying up your mess, son.
If you're too emotionally involved,
 remove yourself.
 Sir - sir, do you have a minute?
 DS Arnott.
 Erm... sir, do you mind
if we talk through here?
 Er, coffee, tea? Ted? Steve?
 Yes, sir, that'll be great.
Coffee for three, please, Sheila.
 Gates is playing you.
 Those lads were using chemistry to
make crack, not bombs,
 and bleach to scrub their sink.
 They were selling drugs to finance
terrorist activity,
 a recognised AQ modus operandi.
 AQ? Al-Qaeda, Jesus Christ.
You're loving this.
 And if you get a promotion
out of it... A little decorum,
please, DS Arnott.
 Sir.
 Terrorism is the single greatest
challenge in modern policing.
 Not to take this seriously
could be catastrophic. Who for? You?
 Steve! Sir - we have reason to
believe, sir,
 that DCI Gates suspended
a surveillance operation,
 thereby facilitating the double
homicide at Greek Lane.
 I'd like to hear
the tape of Gates' call.
 He didn't make it through
Despatch, sir.
 We've got a witness.
 So it's his word against Gates'?
 Look, we have concrete evidence of
an improper financial relationship
 between DCI Gates
and Jackie Laverty.
 When he brought me the evidence
against the terrorist cell,
 DCI Gates was at pains to point out
 the sensitivity of his position
regarding your investigation.
 He declared that Ms Laverty had made
a one-off payment
 to secure his daughters' places at
Edge Park Prep School,
 a payment that was made without his
consent or knowledge,
 and that the money was paid back.
 I have authorised all available
resources, and DCI Gates,
 with his intimate
knowledge of the case history,
 is essential to
the success of this operation.
 At least we have the laddering.
 Come on, that's a drop in the ocean.
We've been round the houses, Steve.
 Round the houses
and down the bloody drains.
 So you're throwing in the towel.
That's rich.
 Look, Hilton blows with the wind.
I thought you were better than that.
 Listen, I would've thought that if
anybody understood
 that counterterrorism can get you
off, it would've been you.
 What's that supposed to mean?
 You were involved in an operation
where an innocent man got killed
 and you're running round,
free as a bird.
 All because our senior officers
would rather see ten innocents die
 than let one terrorist succeed.
So why'd you recruit me then?
 Lately, I've been asking myself
the same bloody question.
 Go on, my son. Go on.
 Phone.
 You bent bastard.
 Yeah?
 There's a copper poking his nose
into one of Jackie's old salons.
 What copper?
 Some DS Arnott.
 You were meant to have this sorted,
you bent bastard.
 Hey it... it was sorted. I...
 I've got to shut the place down
and clear it out by tonight.
 D'you know how
many of these I've got?
 Every place he knows about,
I've got to close.
 Do you know how much
that's going to cost?
 You should've done what you
were bloody told.
 He's anti-corruption.
That means he's after me, not you.
 All I have to do...
He's all over my business!
 All right!
 D'you think he'll turn a blind eye,
you stupid twat?
 If it's one bloke, he can be fixed.
 Hey... Hey, could we...?
Could we maybe take a breath?
 With him gone, you'll be free to do
what I tell you.
 We'll say when and where.
Your job is to get him there.
 I can't...
 I'm out. All right? Gates...
 Hey! And you, you little shit.
 I see you again,
I'm going to arrest you.
 Are you fucking mental?
 Tommy's got your bird.
Your business all up her.
 Your prints are on the knife.
You're fucked, waste man.
 Any luck with the baby-sitter?
Friday night curry with the girls?
 I'm sorry, Nige.
 Yeah?
 Sir, everyone's ready
in the briefing room.
 Right.
 I...
 Put it back
a couple of hours, please.
 Boss.
 Boss!
 Yeah.
 'I am giving you one last chance,
 'ya bent bastard.'
 Hello. 'You came to the salon.'
How did you get this number?
 'I know about the money. I can give
you the information you want.'
 Yeah? Well, how do
I know this isn't a load of crap?
 'There was a woman, Jackie.
 'She got her throat slashed
in the hall of her house.
 'There was a policeman with her.
 'Gates. He's in on all of it.
 'Only information.
 'No police station, no police.
 'No-one but you.' Where?
 Yeah? Great.
We'll come right now.
 We've got Wesley's stepbrother
in Interview Room One.
 What? Well, shouldn't we wait
for the boss to get back? No.
 Kate?
 Yeah, I'll be right there.
 Mr Boyle? It's the police.
You called us, sir.
 Can we come in, Terry?
 Yes. Come in.
 You said there'd been a break-in?
 Yes. I called 999 and they said
they wrote it all down.
 Well, how'd they get in?
 I let them in. Right.
 Er, what did they take, Terry?
 Crisps. Fi... fizzy drinks.
 They stole them?
 No, I gave them to them.
 Right.
 Well, what did they look like?
Just a moment, please.
 I'm very sorry,
but that's the secret signal
 that we've got a very, very
serious emergency to go to.
 If they come back, get their names
and contact the station.
 Thanks for your call.
 That's not a crime,
for Christ's sake.
 It's a social problem.
 Wesley was receiving a supply from
two men who resided at Greek Lane.
 No comment. Look, we're not trying
to pin anything on Wesley...
 we're trying to find out
who killed him.
 Did he ever say there was anything
unusual about these two blokes?
 Sorry, Nige, I'm busting.
I'll be back in a minute.
 Look, those lads that were found
dead in that flat,
 did they have any other mates?
 Arabs, maybe? Pakistanis?
 That you? 'What's happening?'
 I've seen how Jackie's business
laundered drug money.
 '500 quid for a bunch of bananas.
 'I'm on my way to meet an informant
to Gates being in on it.'
 Wait. Gates has gone AWOL. I saw him
setting something up with Morton.
 I don't know what it was but...
 Look, I need to move right now,
Kate. No more wobbles.
 Two identical phones.
 Don't bother saying
there's an innocent explanation.
 Where's Gates? What's he up to?
 Tony's shut me out. Because of you.
 D'you have any idea how that's felt?
 I couldn't give a shit.
 Argh!
 DC Fleming, are you all right?
Don't worry about me - get him!
 I wouldn't.
 This is pointless, Gates.
 It isn't about
me versus you any more.
 The people that Jackie was involved
with, they're all over me.
 Then get in the car.
Turn yourself in.
 I wish it was that simple.
 I'm sorry.
 For Christ's sake,
what are you playing at?!
 Bloody hell! Fleming?
 I'm AC-12. Call IT now and get them
to unlock this bloody computer.
 Now!
 'You were poking your nose
into my business.
 'This is how it's going to work...
 'you tell my lads what you know.
I'll be listening.'
 I can't.
Speak up, you div.
 I don't... What?
 Argh!
 This is Gates.
 Look, it's happening.
What you wanted, it's happening.
 Now you've got to give me
Jackie's body.
 'What, and ruin our relationship?'
 Just give...
 Give it! Give it! Open his hand out!
Get me that fucking finger!
 Who knows about our business?
More police?
 Phone.
 Who knows about our business?
Who? Who knows?
 What's wrong with these things?
 You bastards!
 You big bastard,
what you got to say now?
 I'm arresting you for grievous
bodily harm and false imprisonment.
