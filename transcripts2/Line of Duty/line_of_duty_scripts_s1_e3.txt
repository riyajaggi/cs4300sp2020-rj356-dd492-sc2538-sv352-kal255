 If you want to talk,
call me into AC-12.
 Why go to all that bother
when I'm only after a minor detail?
 The reason you took over a
hit and run.
 Gates was with a woman in a cafe.
You think she's his girlfriend?
 Well she doesn't
appear in his statement.
 She came to the station.
They talked. Something felt odd.
 Inspector Tony Gates,
do you know him?
 I met him
briefly at the police station.
 That's the extent
of your relationship?
 The coroner's set the date to reopen
the inquest in the Karim Ali
shooting.
 You're going to be asked to testify.
 The fire arms officers are saying
you sent them to the wrong flat.
 I am the senior investigating
officer on a double murder.
 That is proper policing son!
 Tony gave me
back the motivation.
 He's a good man. You remember that.
 Arnott's on to you!
I don't know how?
 The hairdressers. You might
as well have hung up a sign saying,
 "Launder your drug money here!"
 No, please don't do this.
 Hey! This is happening Jackie.
 Think Dot
and Morton are covering for Gates.
 He's got to be at Jackie Laverty's
right now! On my way.
 I'm a police... Huh. No!
 Gotcha.
 All right son, calm down.
 What's going on?
 I've checked all of the
ground floor.
 I got here a few minutes ago
to arrest her.
 Front door was open
and there's blood everywhere.
 We should look upstairs.
 What are you waiting for, Arnott?
 She's not up here,
there'd be a blood trail.
 My team.
 Well? What?
 Did you want to check
the bedrooms or not?
 Yeah.
 You should check the rest of these,
 I'm going to have a
look around the back.
 Everything OK, Sarg?
 Yeah. Round the back, quick as you
can, see if you can find her.
 Right, boss.
 Gates?
 Where is she?
 I know as much as you do.
 This was a kidnapping or a robbery,
a meeting, whatever.
 It went tits up.
 We're gonna start the door-to-door
and get the dogs out.
 No. You don't get to lead this
investigation.
 You don't tell me what I can and
I can't investigate, all right, son.
 No sign of her outside, Tone.
 All right, get door-stepping, Dot.
 Nige, lock off the house
and set up a cordon.
 DS Cottan. No, where are you?
 No, you're breaking up.
 Can I help you, DS Arnott?
 I think I can manage,
thank you, DC Fleming.
 Do this now, please. Dabs and DNA.
 Yes, sir.
 Oi, this is my crime scene,
not yours.
 Log him out, Deepak,
and don't let him back in.
 Please.
 Sorry, sir. So tell us, Steve,
what have you got?
 Jackie Laverty went
missing this morning. Missing?
 She was attacked in her home
and now there's no sign of her.
 She wasn't just hiding a
hit-and-run.
 I've believe she was
involved in money laundering.
 What and you think you can connect
Gates with all this?
 Call him in for interview, sir.
 Before he has time to work
out his story. I need one hour.
 Good morning, Rita.
 Morning.
 I need to talk to you
about a hit-and-run investigation
 that was taken over by DCI Gates.
 You're AC-12, aren't you?
 Yeah.
 See, erm...
 My union protects civilian support
staff from talking to you
 in case it causes undue stress
and anxiety.
 Sorry.
 I could always arrest you for
perverting the course of justice.
 Take a seat.
 When exactly did DCI Gates
take over the case?
 When the information
came through from County CID.
 What information?
 From Missing Persons,
about Mr Patel.
 The victim?
 When DCI Gates heard that Mr Patel
had been Jackie Laverty's accountant,
 that's when he took over the...
 case.
 AC-12 interview.
 Present Superintendent Hastings,
DS Arnott, DCI Gates,
 the Police Federation
representative DCI Alice Prior.
 May I, sir? Perhaps
we could postpone this interview?
 DCI Gates has only just learned that
a personal acquaintance
 is missing, presumed dead.
 He's calling her
an acquaintance now?
 Let's do this.
 As it happens, DS Arnott's point was
a good place to start.
 DCI Gates, how would you
describe your relationship
 with Jacqueline Laverty?
 Jackie and I knew each other
20 years ago.
 She was Jackie O'Connor back then
and we were engaged
 but she broke it off to marry a
businessman called Andrew Laverty
 and we lost touch.
 We were reacquainted some five
months ago.
 She told me
about her property business
 and that she was
after a head of security.
 She wondered if I might recommend
some recently retired officers.
 And I made the mistake of giving
her my card.
 Mistake?
 Yeah, she called me the next day.
And the day after.
 And the day after and the day after.
 She wasn't interested
in ex-officers.
 Jackie was recently divorced
from Andrew Laverty
 and she made no bones about
 wanting to pursue
a sexual relationship with me.
 And how did you respond?
 I told her that I was now a
happily married man
 with two young daughters.
 She wouldn't take no for an answer.
 And over the course of the next
few months,
 Jackie Laverty became my stalker.
 And did you report this?
 No, sir.
 Why not, DCI Gates?
 Because she's a good-looking woman,
sir. And we had a past.
 And there's no smoke without fire.
Is there?
 So can you tell me how you became
involved in the hit-and-run
 incident that Ms Laverty reported?
 Well, actually, sir, initially it
was reported as a stolen vehicle.
 It was only afterwards that the
vehicle was linked
 to the hit-and-run.
 Are you aware the victim
of the hit-and-run was
 Jackie Laverty's accountant?
 DCI Gates is entitled
to be questioned by an officer
 at least one rank superior.
 Are you aware that the
victim of the hit-and-run was
 Jackie Laverty's accountant?
 Yes, sir.
When did you act on it?
 And when did you act on it?
 What is this?
Keith Harris and Orville?
 It's all right, Alice.
Let them fire away.
 As soon as I became aware of that
information, I acted on it.
 So straight away?
 Not straight away?
 I was concerned about Jackie's
manipulative behaviour.
 But once I set that aside,
I acted properly,
 by attempting to arrest
her for manslaughter.
 She had a large house,
luxury cars, expensive offices.
 Didn't you ever wonder where the
money was coming from?
 She appeared to be a successful
businesswoman.
 And she received a substantial
settlement in her divorce.
 You had no idea at all there might
be some financial irregularity?
 Absolutely none at all, sir.
 DCI Gates, how did you come
by the information
 that Jackie had killed her
accountant.
 This is the critical piece
of evidence against your stalker.
 Surely you remember exactly
how you found out.
 DCI Gates was not prepared for this
line of questions.
 I request them in writing with
the statutory ten days to respond.
 Rita Bennett informed me,
the civvie support.
 I took a statement from Rita Bennett
prior to this interview.
 I wonder
if her recollection matches yours?
 DCI Gates?
 The information
came in from County CID
 regarding the identity of
the victim.
 That was three days after Ms Laverty
informed me about her stolen car.
 You should have a
copy of that statement.
 Yeah, I'll see to that, Alice, yeah.
 The information you've just given,
why isn't it in the computer file?
 Why... Your answers match
what Rita said
 and what she claims she entered
in the file but it's not there.
 Why not?
 She must be mistaken.
 You deleted it.
 Stop right there. We're all aware of
IT problems as a day-to-day reality.
 Have you any proof that this
file was deleted?
 We could impound the hard drive.
 The database can be accessed by any
computer from the mainframe.
 Do you intend to impound them
all, DS Arnott?
 Send the whole station back to
bikes and whistles?
 DCI Gates's relationship with
Jackie Laverty clearly affected
 his handling of the hit-and-run.
 It's inappropriate for him
to remain SO on her disappearance.
 I was not the problem, she was.
I went to arrest her.
 It's something that you should put
to Tony's superior officer.
 Well, I certainly will, Alice,
if he'll deign to respond.
 Can we go, please?
 DCI Gates.
 I have mobile phone records
relating to your account
 and Jackie Laverty's account.
 Sit down, please,
DCI Gates, sit down.
 These came over this morning, Alice.
 You'll see last week's authority
for the release of phone data.
 The most recent records are
consistent with your testimony.
 Calls and texts from
Ms Laverty directed to your phone.
 None of the calls answered by you.
One-way traffic.
 Go back a little further,
and you're calling her. Texting her.
 Would you like me to read an example
of one of the text messages
 sent by you to Ms Laverty
last month?
 DCI Gates?
 No.
 So, can you tell us
 your true relationship with
Jacqueline Laverty, please.
 We had a one-night stand,
for old times' sake.
 I wanted to end it
but she used it against me.
 Sir, I was protecting my family.
 Well, I think it's fair enough to
say that we have grounds to
 remove you from the case, DCI Gates.
 Fine, sir.
Fine. Thank you, DCI Gates.
 Where were you last night?
Hold your horses.
 It's a simple question. You don't
have to respond, DCI Gates,
 if it's too short-notice to
come up with an alibi.
 Let's leave it there, Tony.
 I went home very late.
 I didn't want to wake my wife,
so I slept in the spare room.
 But I couldn't sleep for worrying
about the case against Jackie.
 So that's when I decided to go
and arrest her.
 Witnesses? As I said,
I was careful not to wake my wife.
 So you didn't spend the night
with Jackie Laverty? No, I did not.
 Why didn't you call for back-up?
Back up, when?
 When you arrived, alone, and found
evidence of extreme violence.
 Well, I knew that my team
were en route.
 And when you turned up,
I assumed between the two of us
 we were up to the task.
 I had to climb over the gate.
How did you get in?
 How...
Did you climb over the gate?
 No, I, um...
Your car was parked on the drive.
 Either you climbed over the gate
with it tucked under your arm,
 or Jackie Laverty let you in.
 I opened the gate.
 What's the code?
 Tell me the code!
 It'll be on Jackie's contact
information.
 There.
 2366.
 I think we should call it a day.
Yeah, I think so too.
 Sir, I sincerely hope you don't
consider you have enough
 grounds to press for suspension.
 DCI Gates has been
extraordinarily co-operative...
 The last number on Jackie's account.
A mobile she called last night.
 07900024731.
 Who did she call?
 I got no idea.
 You weren't present
when she made that call? No.
 That's enough, Steve.
 Sir, DCI Gates has no criminal
case to...
 Forensic scene investigators
are currently harvesting
DNA and fibres from the house.
 Yeah, and they are likely to
find some of mine
 you know, from a previous visit.
 Because I'm not denying
I wasn't ever there.
 And, of course,
I was there this morning, with you.
 Interview terminated.
 No suspension.
 Thank you, sir.
 Tony?
 But you know AC are all over her.
 AC are all over everything
at the moment.
 Look, I've let you down.
 I had a relationship that's
compromised me professionally.
 But none of it, really,
none of it reflects on any of you.
 In fact, it makes your loyalty
all the more humbling.
 But a woman's missing,
 almost certainly deceased.
 And Chief Superintendent Hilton
is in the process
 of appointing another officer
to lead that investigation.
 And we will render that officer
every assistance, OK?
 Hi. DS Arnott.
 I called this morning.
 The glass found at the scene
is teeming with evidence.
 It's very moist.
 We sampled saliva
from around the rim
 and we got two high-quality
fingerprints from the side.
 The prints appear to be
from the same person.
 Initial assessment is they match
the control prints from the house.
 They're Jackie's? Yeah.
 What about the whisky bottle?
Sorry...
 No, nothing.
 Just Jackie's prints again,
you mean?
 No, I mean nothing.
It's been wiped down.
 Thank you.
 I'll be back for the DNA reports.
 From now,
our focus shifts completely
 to the double murder on Greek Lane
and the killing of Wesley Duke.
 So...
 Excuse me.
You better come quick, sir.
 Can't keep his nose out,
can he, eh?
 Hey, DS Arnott - kindly desist.
 I want this car impounded
as evidence.
 I want it cordoned off
and I want HIM kept away from it.
 Then get yourself a warrant.
 What are you looking for - Shergar?
 He wiped down the whisky bottle,
but I know there's a glass
missing from the crime scene.
 He took it cause it's the only thing
that proves he was there.
 Oh, now you're screwed, Tone...
 he's onto your George Michael CDs.
 We done?
 Find anything, Sherlock?
You're wasting your time, mate.
 A thorough search of the property
 revealed no clues to
Jackie Laverty's whereabouts.
 We did a ring-around
of local hospitals,
 no-one matching her description
has been admitted.
 We established a track
on her mobile phone - nothing.
 It's been switched off all day.
 That's as far as we got when
Gates was brought off the case.
 He fought tooth and nail to keep it.
 He knows what the forensics
are going to sound like
 in front of a jury
when the body's found.
 Whoever killed Jackie did it quickly
 and moved the body
without leaving a trace.
 It sounds like a professional job.
Maybe she won't be found.
 That whisky glass
is the only physical evidence
 that can place Gates
at the crime scene. What?
 The search on Gates' car -
it came over as desperate.
 He's the one who's desperate.
 I push him from the outside,
you push from the inside.
 He'll crack.
 Make him lead us
to that whisky glass, Kate.
 Forensics never found anyone's DNA,
except the two victims'.
 Professional crew then -
gloves, the works.
 The search never found any sacks of
drugs stashed under the floorboards,
 but there was residue.
 Very pure crack cocaine.
 Well, maybe they weren't
just muscling in
 on somebody else's territory.
 They were out-trading on quality.
 I want to get over to the alleyway,
 I want to familiarise myself
with Wesley's murder.
 Do you mind if I tag along, sir?
 Just give me a minute.
 DCI Gates.
 Jesus bloody Christ, we could
all go down the pan with him.
 Hey, he stood by you.
 Don't make out
he's some kind of saint.
 We all tick a box for Tony
in front of the top brass.
 Yeah, and we all know
which box you tick.
 Screw you, Nige.
 Wondering if you backed
the wrong horse are you, Dot?
 Whoever committed the murders at
Greek Lane knows we're after them.
 They couldn't have been
more blatant in showing
they're behind this one.
 So you think this was a warning?
 Well, maybe they're taunting us.
 A double murder behind closed doors
is one thing,
 this is a triple now.
 And they hung Wesley up there
for everyone to see.
 Sir, we've got CCTV in
for Greek Lane.
 There wasn't any CCTV on the street.
 Footage from nearby traffic cams.
 Get back to the station
and go through it, please.
 Yes, sir.
 Sir, who's taking over
the Jackie Laverty case?
 DI Ian Buckells. Why?
 Well, the whole station
heard Arnott accuse you
 of being with Jackie Laverty
last night.
 Arnott's got nothing on me.
 That's not what I meant, sir.
 You've lost someone close.
 I'm here, if you need to talk.
 Tony... Hey, darling,
I'm really sorry, about...
 I'm just glad you're OK.
 One of your team's been telling me
about last night.
 Hello, sir.
 Actually, Mrs. Gates,
I'm not on your husband's team.
 I'm in another department
that's taking an interest
 in last night's events.
 Where are the girls?
 They're at clubs.
 This is work, darling.
 Come on, Sammy.
 Thanks.
 Get out.
 Mrs G was relieved to hear
you were working last night.
 I wondered if you'd dropped in
for a nap in the spare room,
 like you stated in your interview.
 She explained the bed
hadn't been slept in.
 It seems there's very strong
circumstantial evidence
 telling me your statement is false.
 Circumstantial evidence -
that's the best you've got?
 I know you wiped down the whisky
bottle and moved the glass.
 That glass is hard physical evidence
you're an accessory to the crime.
 But it's evidence you don't have.
 I'll find it.
 You've got this one chance
to call your solicitor.
 Come to the station
and change your statement,
 before it's too late.
 I'm not going to do your job
for you, Arnott.
 If you want to take me down, you're
going to have to do it yourself.
 Now get the fuck out of my house!
 When you're in a hole, stop digging.
 For your wife's sake.
 For your daughters'.
 Get out.
 Nice house.
 Shame.
 Have a good day, sir.
 Thank you again, Mrs Gates.
 What the hell
were you up to last night?
 I'm handling a triple murder.
 He's AC-12.
 It's, erm, anti-corruption.
 Anti-corruption?
 Oh, my God, Tony!
 They've got nothing,
which is why he's so desperate.
 He's got something on you, though,
hasn't he? No, really nothing.
 Why's he round our house?
 Because he's a prick, darling.
 What are you going to do?
 I'm going to sort it.
 Can you?
 I can and I will.
 I promise.
 Jools?
 How dare you! No-one can ever come
between me and my husband.
 You keep away from this family.
 Hey...
 I've developed a rough timeline of
the night of the Greek Lane murders.
 Four hours before the murder.
 That's the unmarked car
carrying Dot and Deepak.
 They went straight into position
on Greek Lane.
 Skip on two hours.
 A Subaru is heading from Moss Heath
to Kingsgate.
 10 minutes later, the same Subaru
takes the same route.
 10 minutes later - same again.
He's driving circuits.
 Each circuit would allow him
to swing by the Borogrove Estate.
Where the lads are parked.
 I'll skip on two hours. That's Dot
and Deepak leaving the area.
 Five minutes later, here comes the
Subaru, round the junction again.
 No more circuits.
In fact, we don't see it again.
 And what have we got on the vehicle?
Registration belongs to
an identical make and model.
 They've cloned the plates.
They harvest the cars for the jobs
and then dump them.
 Let's get Patrol to be
on the lookout for
all vehicles with cloned plates.
 Yeah, I've already done it, sir.
 That's a good job, Kate.
 I want everybody in on time
tomorrow, please. Yeah.
 You dirty bastards!
 Thanks, wanker.
 Oi!
 Mrs Pilkington! Ryan?
 It's the police!
 Keely!
 Mrs Pilkington, it's
PC Bannerjee from Kingsgate station!
 Ryan was meant to come in
to give a statement this morning.
 What this time?
 We intervened in a street
altercation, Mrs Pilkington.
 Ryan alleges he was assaulted
by an elderly neighbour,
Mr Alf Butterfield.
 Can I come in, please, Keely?
 I checked at his school. They said
he hadn't been in all week.
 Keely, where's Ryan? How should
I know? This is serious, Keely.
 Ryan's failed to attend
for his interview.
What's it gotta do with me?
 Well, he needs to be
accompanied by a responsible adult.
 That's his social worker, innit?
 Well, if the little bugger's not
here, there's no case to answer.
 I'm sorry, Mr Butterfield. You've
already generated a crime number.
There's no room for manoeuvre.
 PC Larkin means either you accept
the caution or it goes to court.
Take the caution.
 Home in time for Bargain Hunt.
 Yeah, but that will mean you have
a criminal record
for a public order offence.
 But...? Criminal record? Well,
he... he's the bloody criminal!
 Fine.
 Have it your own way.
 There... there was a detective.
 Now she said she'd
take care of everything.
 Yeah. I wrote down her name.
 Ah, this is all her fault.
 There...
 Fine, show him in.
 Thank you.
 Sorry, Tony, sorry. Worst
possible timing. I've got to dash.
I only need a minute, sir.
 The interview with AC-12 puts us
in a delicate position.
 I thought it best to come clean.
 That's admirable but, really, I'd
rather let the dust settle before we
have a definitive conference.
 I'll have Sheila put something
in the diary.
 You weren't so shy about standing by
me when the Chief Constable was
hanging a medal around my neck, sir.
 Yes!
 Ah, ah. Ian. Tony, you know DI
Buckells has taken over the Laverty
disappearance? Yeah.
 Any news?
 We've got the dogs out, sir,
but there's no trace of the body
yet. That's disappointing.
 We're developing her
money-laundering as a lead. And...?
 Sir, we've had a major
breakthrough on the triple murders.
 You have? Yes. We should have
it cracked... two, maybe three days.
 I can take that to the
Chief Constable? Absolutely, sir.
 Well, that's excellent.
Well done, Tony.
 We should, er...
 Don't make any assumptions
about Jackie Laverty's fate.
 She was facing a manslaughter
charge. She could've
faked this whole thing.
 Right... She had the cash
and the connections to get herself
out of the country.
 Maybe her ex is involved. OK. Erm...
AC are talking
crap about that whisky glass.
 Don't make a tit out of yourself
chasing shadows.
 I've seen too many ambitious
young DIs looking up the ladder
 without realising they've stepped on
a big slippery snake.
Do you know what I mean?
 Good to see you.
 Sir.
 Patrol sighted a vehicle with
cloned plates on Moss Heath Road.
Back-up's ready to roll. OK.
 Mobilise Tactical Ops.
Full armour, we'll do risk
assessment en route, let's go.
 I'll call Dot.
Let's go, let's go!
 OK, mate.
 Dot's meeting us there, boss.
 'TO-20 joining.
DCI Gates joining.'
 Stand down. DC Fleming, stand down.
What are you talking about?
We're on a job.
 Do I have to arrest you?
Stand down, Kate.
 Fleming's been restricted to
desk duties, sir.
Christ, sir, do something!
 I don't have time for this
right now, Kate.
 There's been activity on Jackie
Laverty's phone. Get a triangulation
and phone it through.
 What's going on with Kate?
Ain't got a scooby.
 Something's been bugging me, boss.
 Arnott was totally convinced
you were with Jackie
the night she disappeared.
 Only people who knew you weren't
answering your job phone was me,
Dot and Kate.
 'Target vehicle
not sighted.'
 DCI Gates' phone. Nige, it's Kate.
 'Triangulation take times
but I can give you
the nearest base station.'
 DC Fleming, standing by.
 Stand by for base station.
 What the hell's going on, Leah?
 There's been a complaint made
about you from some old boy called
Alf Butterfield. Oh, Christ!
 'DC Fleming, come in.'
Fleming. 'T-Mobile base station
93016, macrocell.'
 93016.
 'Corner of Goswell Road and Spedmore
Avenue.' Corner of Goswell Road
and Spedmore Avenue. Corner of...
 I heard. 'Target vehicle sighted.
A black four-wheel drive.'
 DCI Gates to backup. Continue as
directed. I'm going on another call.
 Boss, what are you doing?
Jackie's alive, Nige.
 'Alexander Avenue. 100 metres
southwest of intersection
with Prince Charles Avenue.'
 Alexander Avenue. 100 metres.
Repeat, 1-0-0 metres.
 'Southwest of intersection
with Prince Charles Avenue.'
Got it. Thanks, Kate.
 Next... should be Alexander Avenue.
 Here it is - Alexander.
Left, left, left, left!
 'In pursuit, black four-wheel drive,
travelling southbound
on Prince Charles Avenue.'
 'Target's turning, he's turning!
 'We've lost him.
Not visual, repeat not visual.'
 Nige, get in,
we're going after them!
 Health and safety. This is not
a designated pursuit vehicle.
 Whatever!
 Where? Haven't a clue.
 Get out on the road after them, I'm
going to guide in the backup. Tone?!
 DCI Gates to backup. I'm visual
with the target vehicle heading
north on Prince Charles Avenue.
 Tone. Tone!
 Still visual.
North on Prince Charles...
 Bloody hell, Tone!
 Still visual. North on
Prince Charles, still visual.
'Received.'
 'DCI Gates?'
 Where's Jackie?
Is she still alive?
 No!
 You dirty bastard.
 You little shit!
 Yeah, Tommy?
 He's here.
 'Jackie was working for me.
Now you are,
 'unless you want her body being found
with your dirty business all over her
 'and your prints on the knife.
 'Keep the phone. Don't call us.
We'll call you.'
 You pig. Bastard!
 You pig bastard!
 Pig bastard! Pig bastard!
 Any luck with the DNA on the whisky
glass? Well, we sampled
one set of DNA from the rim...
 Don't tell me -
it matches Jackie's.
 Well...?
You said not to tell you.
 Come here.
 Thank you.
 What's going on?
 I'm chasing forensics that place
Gates at Jackie's murder.
 You got any? No. No.
 But you've just made a spectacle
of yourself by searching Gates's car
in front of the whole station.
 Then you go and visit
the man's wife, at his house.
 I'm trying to put pressure on him.
Play him at his own game.
 How can we expect our officers
to behave professionally, if we can't
behave professionally ourselves?!
 You're over the line here,
son, your way over the line.
 I tell you what...
 You better come back with a result
out of this... for all our sakes.
 Now they know we've ID'd the
vehicle, we can expect it to turn up
in a scrap yard any time soon.
 I've go to go and tell Hilton.
You lot get home,
go and have something to eat.
 Fancy a pint, boss?
Not tonight, matey.
 What was that about desk duties
today?
 It's just some bollocks, sir.
It's been sorted.
 All right.
I'll see you tomorrow.
 Are you sure you're all right, sir?
 Yeah, doctor says I'm fine.
 It's just you was out of contact
for over an hour.
 What happened?
 I was, erm, chasing around
like an idiot
and I made a tit out of myself.
 And I'd quite like to drop it.
 Well, maybe you need that pint
after all.
 I just want to help, sir.
 I'll be honest with you, Kate,
I'm not sure that anybody can.
 How are things at home, sir?
 Look, I'm no angel. I've got
involved with the wrong bloke,
on the job and outside.
 Everyone has to let off a little
bit of steam now and then.
 AC don't get it.
They're robots, them lot.
 They don't get the difference
between a corrupt copper
and a decent one who made a mistake.
 I do.
 Everyone knows there's a piece
of evidence that AC's after.
That doesn't exist!
 What if it did? Give me the chance
to prove myself to you. This is a
conversation we shouldn't be having!
 Well, if Arnott finds it,
that's your career over, sir.
 A genuinely talented officer.
All for one silly mistake.
 I'm not bent! OK, I'm not!
You know that, right?
 Yeah.
 Where is it, sir?
 It's in a skip.
 Who the bloody hell
do you think you are? Easy, Tone,
that's not going to help, mate.
 See down the drain, Gates?
Kind of appropriate.
 You're really loving this,
you bastard! All right,
calm yourselves. What's happening?
 AC got a tip-off about
the whisky glass.
 Anything? No.
 Sorry, what was that about
something going down the drain?
 Would that be your investigation?
 All right.
 You're a tit.
 And you, Buckells.
 I don't get it, sir.
 I made up a story about a phantom
piece of evidence,
 and I told you that it was in a
skip, Nige I told it was in a ditch
and Dot that it was in a pond.
 Deepak, he's the one I told
it was in that drain.
I've been up all night,
 weighing up my career against
helping you out. No, Kate, that's
not what I... You bastard, sir.
 Kate! Kate!
 I was acting on apparently
reliable information.
 We've had a contact request
from Colin Brackley.
He was the senior fire officer...
 Screw him. I wouldn't burn my
bridges if I was you, son. Not now.
 Let me buy you a drink...
I'm not staying.
 Just say what you came here to say.
 The lads are all getting twitchy.
We've all been
suspended from active duty,
 and we've heard you're going
to accuse us of lying to cover up
breaking into the wrong flat.
 And you're saying I screwed up the
orders, sent you in the wrong door?
 This has got out of hand.
That's why I'm here.
 It took guts for you lot to go in
there, thinking he was a bomber.
 All I know is, we've all been
asked to lie and I'm the only one
not going along with it.
 We both know there was a massive
failure of intel. The op was thrown
together without proper prep.
 No-one responsible wants
to cop for that.
That's why they're laying it on us.
 There's no "us".
 There is
if we all tell the same story.
 And in return, none of the lads
put any blame in my direction?
 We're in this together, Steve.
 An innocent man is dead.
 There's not a day goes by
I don't think about that.
 I was the one who pulled
the trigger.
 I'm sick with it, man.
 I can't sleep at night.
 I can't look any other copper
in the eye.
 I'm bouncing my little boy on
my knee and I just burst out crying
for no reason.
 You feel it too, don't you?
The guilt.
 You knew the kill order
was suspect.
If you hadn't passed it on...
 Let me get you another drink.
 Nothing's going to bring him back.
So what good does it do for us to be
thrown on the scrap heap?
 Isn't it better, isn't it a
better service for us to put this
behind us
 and be the cleanest, most dedicated
officers on the job?
 You've already figured that out,
haven't you?
 That's why you joined
Anti-corruption.
 A pint, please.
 You're finished!
 You're over the line here, son,
you're way over the line.
 You take a shot at the king,
make sure you kill him, son.
 So you're going to take all of us
down with you, are you, sir?
 You arrogant wanker.
 What do you want?
 I'd like to speak to DC Fleming,
if I may, sir?
 How can I help, sir?
 Yeah, you were involved in the trace
on Jackie Laverty's phone?
 Erm, it's our best lead on
her possible whereabouts. OK.
 It would be great to get your...
 You want to speak to a member
of my team,
 put in a request, in writing, to me!
 Er, excuse me, sir.
I've been meaning to talk to you.
 Erm, all this Anti-corruption.
It's, er, bad for me nerves.
 I'm sorry to hear that, Rita.
I'll have to go on the sick.
 You'll be missed.
 I don't know, in the last three
months my migraines have got worse.
 I'm sure my union
will have something to say about it.
 I'm sorry,
Ted, I know you've been chasing me.
 It occurred to me that neutral
ground often makes for
more productive conversations.
 It's always nice
to get out of the office, sir.
 Frankly, I've been avoiding this
conversation.
 I was beginning to feel a wee bit
like the ginger stepchild, there.
 I spent two years in AC myself.
 I see this situation
from both sides.
 If Gates
had solved the triple murder,
 he could've shaken off
these allegations.
 Now, he's a dead man walking.
So why keep digging?
 Well, for proof, sir. Proof that
Tony Gates was at a murder scene.
 There are only so many drains
you can look down before
AC-12 becomes a laughing stock.
 We've followed procedure to
the letter, sir.
 I don't doubt it for a minute, but
Tony Gates is, uh, from the South.
 I'm sure you'd be mortified,
Ted, mortified,
 if anyone formed the opinion
that AC-12 makes
 a point of pressing charges
against officers from the South.
 Everyone receives the exact
same treatment.
 Of course, of course,
it's a delicate balance.
 But no one would
welcome the accusation that the case
against an officer from the South
 was being pursued with unusual
alacrity.
 Yeah, I'm here.
 'Your bird's money laundering
is going to lead your lot to me.
 'You better get it sorted out.'
 Look, erm...
 I can't make a move
without being watched.
 'That's your problem,
you bent bastard.'
 Dad!
 Hey, darling.
 We love it when you pick us up.
Do you?
 What are you doing here?
 Well, I thought I'd surprise you,
munchkin, is that all right? Yeah.
 Give me a hug.
 On a separate note sir, we've had
a complaint against DC Fleming...
 er, from Alfred Butterfield -
failure to assiduously
investigate burglary and assault.
 That's small fry, station level.
 Yeah, it's all to do with her
time at the CID.
 I've had a look at the facts again,
 I think DC Fleming really should
return to normal duties at TO-20.
 Yeah, it's your call. Excuse me.
 Yeah.
