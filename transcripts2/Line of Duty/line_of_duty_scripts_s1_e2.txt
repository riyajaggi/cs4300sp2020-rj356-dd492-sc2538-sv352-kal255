 'Officer of the year, Detective
Chief Inspector Anthony Gates.'
 Flat 56.
 Welcome to Anti Corruption.
This will be good.
 Wasn't your fault, son.
 Hit and run? Why us?
 We've got a big sign over our heads
saying, "CID - dump your crap here".
 I'm sick of CID.
I want to join TO-20, Sir.
 I hit something.
What did you hit? A dog.
 'You killed a man.'
 Oh, my god!
 'The finger amputations are clean.
 'It was 10 minutes.'
 15 tops before
the next turn clocked on.
 It's big. It's sexy.
 Makes it mine, OK?
 'We're going to get Gates
with or without you, Steve.'
 Looks like you've found your level,
Arnott. Nobody plays me!
 Didn't know AC 12
used undercover officers.
 I wouldn't be risking it if I didn't
believe Gates was a special case.
 'Mr Patel was an accountant
for Laverty Holdings.'
 'I thought maybe you were clean.
Looks like you're dirty after all.'
 You take a shot at the king?
Make sure you kill him, son.
 Looks like there's still a turd
on the driver's seat.
 Best tell the boss he's here.
In a minute.
 DS Arnott. DCI Gates asked me to
escort you into the building.
 Arsehole.
 Fine.
 Tony Gates - best detective
in the city.
 You? You see someone getting results
and you have to bring him down.
 You're safe, then.
 I never worked hard enough.
Tony Gates has.
 He cares about solving crime.
 You done?
 Haven't finished me smoke yet.
 Shall we get a move on?
 Bollocks!
 Having a bit of a bad time.
All right, mate.
 DCI Gates, I bear a signed action
 assigning me access to TO-20 files.
 You're a bean counter.
How does that feel?
 Briefing room, please.
 OK. Greek Lane. Two unidentified IC6
males. Amputated fingers.
 Fingers were cut off while these
lads were still alive.
 Most likely with bolt-cutters
 and most likely to extract
information.
 Given the finger count, looks like
they didn't have much to say.
They gave the murderer the finger.
 Yeah, 20 times!
 Maybe it was a warning?
Well, it worked on these two.
 Right. Known dealer Wesley Duke,
 seen ingressing
and egressing the dwelling.
 The house became the subject
of a surveillance op.
 We're assuming the offenders
broke in via the window.
 The 15-minute window between
Deepak and Dot leaving
 and the next shift arriving.
 Yeah, I'm sorry about that, Tone.
Very sorry, sir.
 If we'd have stayed,
we'd have gone over the hour.
 They're all over us about
overtime, boss.
 So we make it up by nicking
whoever did it, right?
 Cheers, Tone.
 Well, all this makes Wesley Duke
our principal lead.
 Worth bringing him in?
 Oh, I've already had
uniform pick him up.
 Interview Room 1.
 Sir, I hope it's OK, but I'm just
going to go over our case load.
 Knock yourself out.
 I'll just be a minute, Nige.
Oh, don't mind me.
 'Interview under caution'
 of Wesley Duke by Detective Chief
Inspector Anthony Gates
 in the presence of Wesley's
solicitor, Lis Burton.
 You've both had the benefit
of disclosure, so you're aware
 that we have evidence
that Wesley was a frequent visitor
 of the house on Greek Lane.
Tell me what you were buying.
 Hard food? White boy?
 No, I was just borrowing some DVDs.
 I see.
 So, you would take away some DVDs,
 come back the next night
and what, borrow some more?
 That's correct. Disclosure
of evidence and four hours
 and this is the story
you've cooked up? All right.
 I would be very disappointed
if you couldn't tell me
 the titles of some of those DVDs.
 Iron Man 2. Kick-Ass. Piranha 3D,
except not in 3D.
 Yeah, all right, Wesley. Well done.
 But what I really want to know is,
those lads who were lending
 the DVDs, who were they and where
were they getting their DVDs from?
 They were just some lads
that was into DVDs, innit?
 Thing is, Wesley, those lads were
brutally murdered and you are
 the only person that we can connect
to that house.
 And that makes you prime suspect.
Mr Duke had nothing to do
 with the murder and you know it.
 Wesley, where were you
between the hours of 11pm
 on Wednesday the 4th
and 6am on Thursday the 5th?
 No comment.
No alibi offered at first interview.
 My line of inquirys? They're going
to hit you like a steamroller
 if you don't stop feeding me this
pack of porkies.
 My client strenuously
denies the allegation.
 You have no forensic evidence
as per disclosure.
 This is going to be a compensation
claim for wrongful arrest.
 Have him, Tone.
 OK.
 Interview terminated.
 Thank you very much, Wesley.
 You've been a great help.
What you mean?
 As a token of our gratitude
for the information you've provided,
 I'll have you returned home
in a marked police car.
 He'll thank you warmly
in front of the whole estate.
 Then I'll get our
community policing operations
 to make a blatant point
of turning a blind eye
 to all of your activities.
 He's just turned a ferret
into a rat.
 Whoa, whoa! My client is absolutely
not a police informer.
 So?
 Interview continued. How long were
they operating out of that house?
 Not long. A month, tops.
 And where were they from?
 Some Arabs or Muslims or something.
 What were their names, Wesley?
Ali... Ahmed... How am I supposed
to know?
 Do you know where were they getting
their supply? Of DVDs?
 They never said. They had loads.
 Good quality.
Not mixed up or nothing.
 All right. Now we're getting
somewhere. I need one more fact.
 Anything, Wesley.
Help me to help you out here.
 It came in some white sacks.
 They!
THEY came in some white sacks.
 Can I go now?
 No.
 Not with our paperwork.
 Interview terminated.
 Cheers.
 You'll be fine. This week
they're only into burglaries.
 Rita? Jackie Laverty.
 Oh! All yours.
 Thanks.
 Has DCI Gates called you in?
 DCI Gates?
 He's, er, taken over your case.
 If you come with me,
I'll see if he's available.
 Officer of the year.
 Ms Laverty, isn't it?
 Would you like to come into my
office, please. I'd be happy to.
 Thank you, Rita.
 You're welcome, sir.
 Can you leave the door open, please?
 Thank you.
 Have a seat.
 So I welcome this opportunity to
bring you up to speed, Miss Laverty.
 We're satisfied there was
a break-in at your home
 that enabled the thieves to steal
your vehicle.
 It was subsequently involved in a
fatal hit-and-run with a pedestrian.
 We've looked at identifying the
victim through Missing Persons.
 There was an individual who appeared
to match the deceased.
 However, that is no longer
an active line of enquiry.
 Your case remains open and unsolved.
 Just in case you think of
contacting me again.
 I hope that clarifies
the situation, Ms Laverty.
 I see.
 Rita? Could you show
Ms Laverty out, please?
 Steve? I just had a call from Kate.
 I skimmed the hit-and-run file, sir.
It's a red herring.
 Don't you think it's curious
that the Officer of the Year
 should be involving himself
in a hit-and-run incident?
 He knows we're on to him
and he's deliberately taken
 on a low-profile case with virtually
zero chance of clean-up.
 What I do have, sir,
 is a pattern of laddering
going back years.
 Gates selects an open-and-shut case
and bumps up additional charges.
 He's clearing four crimes for every
one that's actually committed.
 Tony Gates, eh?
 He's your bent copper
for the 21st century.
 Steve, when I first came over here,
there was ten bent coppers
 to every station - minimum.
We didn't put our house in order.
 These new procedures,
we brought them on ourselves.
 And Gates is using this messed-up
system to get to the top.
 But why, Steve? Why is he doing it?
 What's in this for him, hm?
 Hiya. Hey.
 Hi there, how you doing?
 The performance is just
there on the left.
 Medium latte? Thank you.
 What's your name? Nadzia.
 Hawaii Five-O.
 Could I ask you some
questions please, Nadzia?
 Should I ask for a lawyer first?
 Depends if you're a
criminal or not.
 I'm a very good person.
Then you'll be fine.
 Nadzia. N-A-D-Z-I-A.
 Surname?
 Wojcik. W-O-J-C-I-K.
 Last week, a police officer
was having breakfast here.
 There was a mugging outside and
he intervened. I remember.
 Does he regularly
receive free meals?
 No, he never came in before.
 Some officers make sure everyone
knows they're in the job.
 Fishing for special treatment.
They were quiet, no trouble.
 He was with someone?
 Yes.
 Another police officer?
 I don't know, but she didn't do
anything to stop the mugging
 like he did.
 A woman?
 Yes.
 Young? Old? Attractive?
 You mean do I think she was
his girlfriend?
 Was she?
 Is it a problem for policemen in
this country to have girlfriends?
 It depends who the girl is.
 She mustn't be a criminal?
 Exactly.
 Or a witness?
 Do you remember the woman well
enough to give me a description?
 Tall. Slim. Dark hair.
 Mid-forties. Well-dressed.
 So, your new boyfriend's
ex-girlfriend's been on Facebook,
 calling you a slag?
I want her done.
 I've got loads I could be doing!
 Excuse me.
 Control just picked up a silent
alarm going off at
 Kingsgate Canalside.
 I haven't even done her MG11 yet.
Audit'll be all over me.
 Where's Reynolds? Off sick.
 Peterson? On a course.
 Well, this is a CS.
You'll have to take the new boy.
 So, what's CS?
 Control Strategy Crime. This week
it's burglary - dwellings.
 Next week we'll be told
to ignore them.
 He's bound to have legged it by now.
 Yeah, but it's better give it
the once-over, though.
 For Christ's sake, Simon!
Risk assessment first!
 Whoa, whoa! Come on, mate.
Look, don't be a pillock.
 Get back! I'm warning you, get back!
The pair of you!
 I'll do it! I'm warning you!
He's on summat.
 Just... just stay calm, OK?
Look, you don't need to do this!
 That is so many more
forms to fill in.
 You didn't break his jaw
as well, did you, Kaz?
 Ha-ha! Be my guest, Sarge.
 Lee, I'm Detective
Sergeant Janson. Lee.
 Lee!
 What d'you want?
 Your offence today took place in one
of our control strategy hot spots.
 Unfortunately for you, that means
that when you're discharged
 we'll charge you
with the full force of the law.
 Oh, yeah, I'm having
a brilliant day!
 What will help you enormously
when it comes to sentencing,
 is if you agree for other offences
to be taken into consideration.
 TIC. Oh, nice one.
Yeah, I don't want prison.
 I've got Benidorm booked.
 There was a house burgled
in Edge Park. Yeah, I did that.
 Lock-up garages in Moss Heath.
 Yeah, that was me, yeah.
 A hairdresser's in Moss Heath?
Did that, yeah.
 House burglary in Edge Park.
 Burglary, another one in Moss Heath.
Moss Heath.
 Hotel in Borough Grove.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
 Shop in Borough Grove.
Shop Borough Grove, yeah.
 Outstanding work, Janson.
Right, thank you, sir.
 The Crime Audit Office
will be delighted.
 I look forward to that
automated e-mail!
 DC Fleming, interview room three,
when you're ready.
 Mr Butterfield,
please don't get up.
 I'm devastated by what's
happened to you.
 I know you're angry and upset.
 And you're entirely within
your rights to lodge a complaint.
 Well, I'm the last bloke who'd want
to say a bad word against the police.
 I believe you, sir.
And I've got some good news.
 We've arrested a burglar who
confessed to robbing your property.
 What, the one who attacked me?
 He didn't confess to that.
 Oh, well, it'll be the one from
before, the one who took my telly.
 Well, I can certainly look into it
for you, sir. Yeah?
 Mr Butterfield, I can see that
you don't want frontline officers
 tied to desks while your attacker's
still out there.
 You have no idea
of the hours, days,
 of admin required
to process a complaint.
 Give us the chance to work for you
instead.
 Thank you. Someone will be along
to see you shortly.
 Oh, hi, sir.
Hiya. I am going to talk to uniform.
 Put a priority on this bloke
the next time he triple-9's.
 Oh! Would you, sir?
You're part of my team now, Kate.
 Means I don't stand by
and let you carry something
like this on your own.
 Oh, thank you, sir.
 I see what the highest detection
rate in the region buys you.
 We'd better crack these murders
 or I'll be trading her in
for a Reliant Robin.
 Best job cars.
Best job phones and computers.
 It must've been hard
getting on this squad.
 For a while it was touch and go
whether I'd ever get out
from behind a desk.
 What happened, Nige,
if you don't mind me asking?
 I took a bullet for one of the lads.
 Really?
 You think about
throwing in the towel, retiring.
 Tony gave me back the motivation.
He's a good man.
 You remember that.
 Yeah.
 Wesley referred to a large supply
of drugs in little white sacks.
 Whoever killed them appears
to have stolen the stash.
 Maybe it's just really well hidden
and no-one's found it yet.
 I never saw your motor outside?
 It's parked across the street, Nige.
Oh?
 Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
 I am, sir.
 Sir?
 Nothing. Bollocks.
 We'll find it.
Nige, get a search team in here.
 What, now or... Yeah, now, please.
Cheers, mate. All right.
 We'll need something sharp to
get the rest of these up.
 Well, we won't be able to use
Nige then, will we, sir?
 Slow but sure sometimes
wins the race, Kate.
 Did you bring me into
the squad for the same reason?
I'm not following you.
 Well, I'm more than just another
tick off the diversity box.
 Somebody said something
they shouldn't?
 It doesn't matter what
other people say. It's what you say.
 I say you're a good detective,
 which is rare seeing as no-one
bothers training you lot any more.
 But that's not the whole reason
you appointed me, is it?
 You're a good detective.
 Hilton's the one who cares
about ticking boxes.
 I care about cracking cases.
Yeah. Me too, sir.
 I need copies of all
the original documentation
 relating to a hit-and-run,
crime number G89635.
 Just get a photo.
 Do you think AC-12
have targets too?
 Cos that tosser's only going
to hit someone else's. Oh!
 Good day at the office, DCI Gates?
 One call and you're on
a harassment charge.
 Yeah, I could do the same
for your goons.
 If you want to talk to me, Arnott,
 call me into AC-12, we'll do
it in front of my federation rep.
 Why bother when
I'm only after a minor detail?
 The reason you took over
a hit-and-run.
 I mean, it's hardly
officer of the year material.
 It may harm your defence, if you do
not mention when questioned...
 I expect you know the rest.
 I received information
that the incident in question
 was connected to one of my team's
ongoing investigations.
 That information was wrong.
You haven't bounced
it back to Traffic yet?
 Hey! I am the senior investigating
officer on a double murder.
 That is proper policing, son.
Maybe you remember it?
 I'll wait for those documents,
thank you.
 He could feel
his grandfather's spirit
 reaching out across the years,
 urging him to take
the first big step.
 Scott took a deep breath
and then he said for all to hear,
 "I'm ready." OK, bedtime, please.
 Can't we have another story?
 No, no, I'll be reading
all night. Go.
 Just one...
 No, darling,
it's time for bed. Let's go.
 Thank you.
 Daddy. Yep?
Can I have a drink?
 You've brushed your teeth
so only water.
 I don't like water.
 Go to sleep, please.
 Good night, guys.
 I'm sorry about going along
with the banter today.
 I don't give a toss.
 What pisses me off is going
to Hastings behind my back.
 Every piece of information
I feed you risks blowing my cover.
 Well, I did get into the hit-and-run,
in my own way.
 The vehicle was reported stolen by
Jackie Laverty, a property developer.
 She came to the station.
They talked.
 Something felt odd.
 During Breakfastgate,
 Gates was with a woman in the cafe,
described as tall, slim, dark hair.
 You think she's his girlfriend?
 Well, she doesn't appear in
his statement.
 She isn't named as a witness.
 Suppose Jackie Laverty is Gates'
bit on the side.
 She goes to him,
damsel in distress...
 And needs him to make sure no-one
challenges her alibi.
 Minimum, that's perverting
the course of justice.
 Anything on the victim?
 No, no ID yet.
I'm going to start working on it.
 And getting everything on her.
 OK.
 'Night. Yeah. See you.
 Is everything OK?
Yeah. She just had a bad dream.
 But she's off now.
 I'm so proud of you today,
well done, sweetheart.
 Do you want a cup of tea?
Yeah. Just, give me five.
 OK.
 Hello.
'I didn't think you'd pick up.
 'I had a message all prepared.
 'I was... I was going to say
how sorry I was about coming
to the station.
 'I had to see you, Tony.'
 That bloke, the one that jumped out
in front of your car
 on the dark country lane,
 he just happened to be your bloody
accountant, did he?
 For Christ's sake, Jackie!
 'Let me explain, please.'
Yeah. What do you take me for?
 'Having you back in my life
after all these years...
 'Now I'm losing you
all over again.
 'You're all I think about.
 'I'm thinking about you now, Tony.
 'I'm thinking about
what I let you do to me.
 'Are you thinking about
what I let you do?
 'You know I'd do anything you ask.
 'Anything. Nothing's off limits
for you and me, Tony. Nothing.
 'I know what we do is wrong.
 'I wish you were here,
inside me right now.
 'Nothing else compares.
 'I'd die if we ever had to stop.
 'Oh, I wish you were here now,
Tony.'
 I am.
 I was giving Gurjit a lift home.
 I started telling him about my plans
to expand
 and that he wasn't in those plans.
 He flipped. I thought he was
going to attack me.
 I-I panicked, Tony.
 I-I never meant to hurt him.
Why would I?
 Tony, please.
 This is why I came to see you.
 No-one else would believe me.
 Only you.
 Only my love.
 I'm being investigated.
 Because of me?
 Maybe.
 No-one knows, do they?
 No.
 Not even your wife.
 No.
 Tony, the last thing I want is
for this to hurt you or your family.
 I understand if I can never
see you again.
 Woah!
Welcome to the Borogrove Estate.
 Why aren't these kids in school?
 Where have you been
the last 20 years?
 What, we've surrendered the streets?
For once, we're on 'em.
 Try and enjoy it, mate.
 You want a coffee, coffin dodger?
 Show your face. Stupid old wanker.
 Fuck off!
 Oh! That's disgusting!
Go on, Ryan. Do it!
 You said I could call and you'd send
someone round straightaway.
 Agh! Jesus.
 Woah, where you get those trainers,
blud?
 Get lost, rude boy.
Woah, Wesley.
 Have some blud clart respect!
 Woah, woah, woah, chill, man.
 Tom wants to speak to you.
 Hello. 'Arsehole!'
 Yo, Tommy.
 'Dealing with them Arabs.'
Yo, Tom, I'd never disrespect you.
 'Them Arabs lost their fingers!
You give the kid your score.
 'If it doesn't get to me by tonight,
you'll go the same way they did.'
 Wanker! I phoned them.
They'll have the lot of you!
 Your house smells better
 now it don't smell of piss,
you old bastard.
 Hey!
 Enough! Enough!
Oi, get off him. Get back.
 Calm down. Oi, calm down.
He fucking whacked me.
 He got what was coming.
 I want him done for whacking me
and for fucking swearing and that.
 I never assaulted him.
I just walloped him, that's all.
 You stupid old bastard.
Shut up, you!
 Mr Butterfield, I'm very sorry,
but I've no choice but under
 guidelines stipulated
in the Public Order Act,
 I must arrest you for assault.
Turn your pockets out. Kaz, really?!
 Oi! Get back to the vehicle!
 What the hell are you playing at,
Simon? This is the Bog.
 We don't ever leave the vehicle.
 Early! Idiot!
 Are you the proprietor
of this hairdressing business, sir?
 Manager. Not chief stylist?
 What do you want?
 I'm following up on a burglary
that occurred some weeks ago.
 I understand these premises
are owned by Laverty Holdings. Sure.
 Do you know Ms Laverty?
She's the owner?
 Blonde, big lady.
 That's her. Anything else?
 No.
 Deepak.
 So what's the twat been up to?
 Deepak?
 I'm a little bit nervous
about spying, sir, on AC.
 Of course you are.
 And that's why I really appreciate
you doing this for me.
 Cos we're all in this together.
Not exactly, sir.
 You mean he's my problem
and mine alone?
 I mean...
 Cos we're a team, Deepak, and that
should mean something to you.
 Of course it does, sir.
 Cos if you want out, son,
there's plenty in line.
 He was checking out a hairdresser's
on the Bog, sir.
 It's a burglary TIC.
 That's it? Yeah.
 Is something wrong, sir?
 No, it's all good.
 Cheers, mate.
 These units are available right now,
yes? Absolutely, yes.
 We've got the cash flow
 for immediate uptake for 15 per cent
off the asking price.
 15?
 Mark, could you find out what that
gentleman in the suit wants?
 You already have four units
at a discounted price...
 Can I help you, mate?
 Yes, but don't you think
that gives me a bit more leverage
 for some understanding?
 Excuse me. Could you just give me
a moment, please?
 Mark, it's OK. It's all right.
 Ms Laverty? Yes.
 Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott.
 You're here to declare an interest
in commercial units?
 How can I help you?
You must be doing well for yourself,
given the economic climate.
 We've made shrewd investments.
 60 billion quid. Excuse me?
 Estimated annual revenue
from white-collar crime.
 20 times the cost
of conventional robbery.
 Am I being accused of something?
 A month ago, your hairdressing
business in Moss Heath was burgled.
 We only own those premises.
 The business operating there is
an independent commercial entity.
 Well, when I questioned him
earlier today,
 the manager of the salon indicated
 there was a direct business
relationship with you personally.
 He didn't seem to know you from Adam.
Why should he know me?
 That's true, you have dozens
of these places, don't you?
 And today you appear to be taking
an interest in market units?
 Maybe you'd like to discuss this
somewhere less public?
 I'm very happy to cooperate with
your investigation,
 but as this is a commercially
sensitive area,
 I'd prefer my solicitor was present
to verify all the small details.
 Are you familiar with the term
"captive business"?
 Services paid for in cash
with no paper trail or ID.
 Earnings from illegal activities
can be hidden
 through the books of salons,
market stalls etc.
 All the money goes to
the bank and bingo, it's clean.
 I'm in the middle of a meeting...
Laundered money finds
its way back to criminal interests
 while the launderer takes his cut,
or hers.
 Like I said, I'm happy to cooperate.
 As you were when your stolen vehicle
was used in a hit-and-run. Yes.
 The officer in charge of that case,
Detective Chief Inspector Tony Gates.
 D'you know him?
 I met him briefly
at the police station.
 That's the extent
of your relationship?
 See, I have a witness to your
breakfast in Kingsgate
 the morning before
your car was stolen.
 Ms Laverty, you'll attend
Anticorruption Unit 12,
 located at this address,
with your solicitor at 9am tomorrow
 to be interviewed
under police caution
 by myself and my superior,
Superintendent Hastings.
 If you do not have a solicitor,
one will be appointed for you.
 I'm not arresting you at this time,
 but if you fail to attend, a warrant
will be issued for your arrest.
 Do you understand, Ms Laverty?
 What's going on?
 Let's talk outside.
 The coroner's set the date
to reopen the inquest
in the Karim Ali shooting.
 You're going to be asked to testify.
Only to be expected.
 But the firearms officers
are revisiting their statements.
 They're saying you sent them
to the wrong flat.
 I'm fighting your corner,
 but this can't not affect your
position here, Steve.
 I thought we were going over
the Greek Lane files again, sir?
 We'll do it tomorrow. Yeah, well,
what about the duty super?
 Did you get her to sign off
on the extra forensics?
 You're a lying bitch.
Arnott's onto you.
 I don't know how.
 The hairdressers, Jackie.
The flea-pit over at Moss Heath.
 You might as well have hung up
a sign saying,
"Launder your drug money here."
 You stupid bloody bitch.
Please, listen to me.
 The accountant found out about it,
didn't he? Tony...
 No, he saw the dirty money
 going through the books
and he decided to talk.
 So you lured him out to the country
and then you ran the poor bugger
over, didn't you? Tony...
 I'm not some 25-year-old
that's wet behind the ears.
 That was the sap that fell
for all your lies.
 They weren't lies. I loved Andrew.
 No. You loved his money, Jackie.
 Look, I know that I've hurt you.
But haven't I made it up to you?
 Jacqueline Laverty, I'm arresting
you for manslaughter. No, Tony...
 that may harm your defence
 if you do not mention when
questioned... You're hurting me!!
 Something that you later
rely on in court.
 Don't do this, please.
 May be used in
evidence against you.
 No, no, no. No, please don't do
this! Please don't do this.
 No, please don't do this.
 This is happening, Jackie, OK?
 Please don't do this,
please don't... Come on.
 I never told you.
He questioned me today.
 DS Arnott.
 He's putting it all together, but
it's you he's after, Tony, not me.
 I was on a dark lane
in fear of my life.
 I'll be acquitted, I'll be free,
but you, you'll go to prison.
 What's that like, Tony,
for a policeman?
 On the special wing, with all
the psychos and the paedophiles.
 It's never going to happen.
 Your wife will know about us.
Your daughters.
 What will they think of their daddy?
 Don't talk about my kids.
 It's not your future or mine -
it's theirs.
 Tony...
 Poor baby.
 I can fix this.
 We'll fix it. Leave it to me.
 'DS Arnott,
please leave a number and a message
 'and I'll call you back.'
 Steve, it's me.
Something's happened.
 Gates went off in a weird mood
earlier.
 No-one knows where he is.
 I can't track him down
without raising suspicions.
 Call me when you get this, Steve.
 That's the wanker. He's the one
who wouldn't give over his score.
 Oi!
 Wanker!
 Right, let's clear the area.
 Home now, girls. These kids
shouldn't be looking at this.
 They should be in bed.
Jesus, it's a school night.
 Keely? What? You never came in
for that follow-up interview.
 Ain't bothered 'bout that slag any
more. You're dropping the charges?
 Hey, result.
Result my arse.
 It's a six-page form to convert it
to a non-crime crime number.
 Home, now!
 He must've made one hell
of a racket.
 Any of you lot see anything?
 No. Piss off...
 Yeah, thought not.
 Well, we know who killed him.
 The same outfit that killed
the two dealers.
 Have you called Tony?
 Left a message on his mobile.
I'll call him at home.
 Easy. We don't want to go
waking his missus now, do we?
 Are you kidding? No, I'm not.
 Right, let's just
break these lot up.
 They're more likely to talk
on the QT.
 Jonesy, give us a hand.
 Come on, everyone,
that's about enough for one night.
 This is the most entertainment
we have.
 Don't do that.
 Arnott. Oh, for Christ's sake,
Steve, where are you?
 I think Dot and Morton
are covering for Gates.
 He's got to be at Jackie Laverty's
right now. Get over there.
 I'm sorry. I, I can't do this.
 You're a witness. I'm sorry.
 This is for the best, Tony.
 We get to keep seeing each other.
 Maybe you shouldn't have any more.
 It'll be morning soon.
 Let's go back upstairs.
 Did you hear the security gate?
 You should see who it is.
Keep them busy.
 I'm going to head out the back.
 Oh no, no, Tony, Tony!
 Oi! I'm a police...
 Oh no, no, please.
