 Previously... Indeed an accident during starting up the particle accelerator, it may have caused consequences of immeasurable proportions. If so, certainly the Earth now will be very different. I think you'll never see these images. But to be safe, I want you to know... I love you. And that I will love you forever. The Earth as we knew it, no longer exists. The only thing we know for now is that it has a 99% liquid surface. "We see land about 15 miles north-west."

 "Let's try to land, guys." There is land. This flight, MCSI-254, came out of his path. The captain lies. In order to explore the route of that plane it could take five years. Maybe ten. That will be a great blow for the crew. It won't be a blow because we won't tell them. You can choose whether to stay in the team of rabbits or in mine. But I will not accept more lies. Great. Before the accident and... the bubble in the brain, I was smart like now?

 - Not even half of what you are now. - How lucky I was, right? I always picture the beautiful things I see. You want her to be your girlfriend? And who do you like? The dude with the robe? Gamboa. Professor of physical education and survival. The Captain's Daughter would go out with the villain of the ship? Let him go! And you're sure you're making the right choice? Do you have a relationship at the moment? These questions are written by hand. They accuse me of being insensitive, lacking in affection, - Asocial... - Antisocial, unwilling to integrate... And if suddenly there was someone... which they found out of all your flaws? In that case we should talk about it, right? You pay attention... if she turns to look at you as she goes after you have spoken. Because if she does... it means she likes you. I'm in love with Ulises. I'm in love... You sure you're in love with Julia? Absolutely cooked. But she decided. So the question is closed. But when you like a girl, you let Gamboa take her away. Forget Ainhoa... or someday you wake up in one of those boxes while it sinks. Very well. Don't ever threaten someone with a weapon if you're not going to use it. Do you remember a few days ago he was going to kill your father. If she want to stay with that jerk, okay, I won't be the spare wheel to anyone. Come live with me. Then empty two drawers of the cabinet, us illegal immigrants travel with a few things. I wanted to ask your consent... For Ainhoa to come live with me. It's that I don't like Gamboa at all. Snitch... I hope you are happy and everything is fine, No, this is not a fish. It's a ship. We combed all this. Either it moves like lightning or it would have appeared on the radar hours ago. Maybe it's not a ship. Can be a container adrift or the fish that followed us, - A wave, a rock, I don't know. - Julian, it was a ship. Do you know what it would mean for us? There it is again. Turn on the ICE. - Good morning. - Hey, good morning. You want me to put it all together? Okay. Identify the ship and track its location on the map. Julian, we can't lose it. As a child I had many toys. A bear, a ball, a sticker album, a console... and a box full of toys that not even I was using. Are you okay? Yes. I hit on a soft part, it does not hurt. - Are you sure? - Yes... bad! It's at 20 miles. It's a private yacht, the Kore-Kore. But my mother said that the important thing are not toys, it is to have someone to play with. Four people in the crew, number 745295. Julian, you don't lose it, it will take 15 minutes to spot them. Here North Star to Kore-Kore. Do you hear me? Over. Proceed to half strength. She was right, because now I don't have many toys... - Do you want sugar? - Yes, please. - How many tablespoons? - Two. - But I have many friends to play with. - Well, thank you. - It's good? - Very good. A cheers? Speaking the captain of the North Star, Kore-Kore, anyone hear me? - See you later. - Bye. North Star to Kore-Kore, anybody hear me? Over. - Hello, how are you? - Well. I don't have the courage to read it. You open it? - Are you sure? - Yes. Okay. And the winner is... Okay. They took you, they gave you the job! I knew that they would give it to you. I had already told my friends my boyfriend works in Geneva. Anything else? They didn't put a card, a certificate? You wanted them to give you the keys to the particle accelerator? Now? The first day? But it is very strange, isn't it? - No, there is nothing here. - You can not. Now I have to embark for three months, but... when I return... will you marry me, Marimar? Yes, of course I will. Let her breathe a little, you'll suffocate. What a beauty. Take a picture to capture the moment? - I wish you much happiness. - Thank you, Salome. What a beauty you are, Marimar. El Barco - 1x09 - A point in the radar - Translation and synch: johanna.p, ziomele, Alle83, Saropula Revision: Allison Good morning. - Hello. - Hello, did you sleep well? The bed is a bit small but yes, good. Look, about yesterday... I was tired and I crashed. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yes. Well... it's be because I'm still  not used to this, but it's okay. I'm going to take a shower below because I have my stuff in my locker. Okay. Ainhoa, wait. My parents... were married with a marriage by proxy, and have been happily together for 60 years. Love grows little by little, step by step. There's time. Go There it is. Three miles to starboard. Maybe we are not the only ones to have survived the storm. Lower the sails. We will advance only with the engine. Stop the engines. Stop? But it's right there. There is something that I don't like about that boat. Ricardo... I only see some barrel aft. Normal. Then why not respond to the radio and no one comes out to greet us? And not only that, look at the flag. It's hoisted upside down. A cry for help, but... where is the problem? Stop engines. - What are you doing? What are you doing? - What is it? Do not enter, get out. The bathrooms are mixed, no? Yes, but now there is no one and I want to take a shower alone, get out, please. Then turn off the light, okay? I won't see you and you won't see me, as if we did not exist. So I do not freeze to death out here. Shit. - Listen... - Fuck that fear, I thought of being alone. - Are you snitch? - No, I am your mother. You have shampoo, shower gel or something? That is, we can't share the shower, but the shampoo yes, right? How smart. Here. What is this stuff? - Shit, Oh God! - What is it? Take them off, take them off! - Take them off, take them off, please! - Wait, wait. - You wanted to go fishing? - Take them off, take them off. Burbuja, look at all this rice. We can cook rice soup, risotto with vegetables, risotto with cuttlefish that you like so much, we can make a Eros risotto. - Salo... - Tell me. I know a girl... which is called Marimar? Mamma mia, what a morning! - Who should I know? - Marimar. We were in a park, and you were doing a photo. - Don't you remember? - I don't remember, honey, I don't remember. Bring me a broom, please. I remembered her. She was blonde. And you used to call her Marimar. No, my darling. No. It must have been a dream, my love. As far as I know, you only know girls of the ship and me. And none of us is called Marimar. Get me a broom, Burbuja. Are you sure? Because you were there. If you were there you know her. - Don't you know her? - No, I don't know her, Burbuja. I'm absolutely sure. As well as I'm sure I never won the lottery, that's why I'm here. If you stay here, help me in the kitchen. If not get on the deck to clean. Do you understand? I still feel something behind my head. It tickles. - There is nothing. - Yes, but look good, please. There is nothing. You're an idiot. I didn't do it on purpose. I took the jar in stock, where there is shampoo. - I still feel something here. - Snitch. - Snitch, snitch... - Look at this, please. I'm checking hair by hair. There is nothing. So what? I know how to use the transmitter. It's like a very powerful walkie... it not only sends signals at a great distance... but receives them too. Now what do you want me to do? Forget it exists. And no matter what happens, not a word to the captain. Got it? got it. Wait, stop, stop. Don't move, don't move. - Take it off, take it off, please. Take it off! - There is nothing. I was joking. It was a joke, to tease you, there is nothing. - Fuck you and your jokes. - No. - And they really suck. - How? I stop to wash. I'm leaving. - I stop to wash. - No, please, please. - There is nothing, I removed... - I hate it. - Do not. It bothers me. - But there is not even... - Take it off, please. I beg you. - There is not a worm. - Check well below. - I'll check, but there aren't any more. - Snitch, a question. - What is it? Is your boyfriend jealous? I have washed my hair with earthworms. Someone is using the conditioner as food for bait. On this ship... you can not trust anyone or anything. Doctor, do not step in the locker room? - Ulises, you're filling up with water. - Sorry. A round of applause for the bride, guys. How was your wedding night? Well, well, it went well. - Well. - Have you lost weight tonight, huh? Okay, okay, that's enough. Sit down. Never mind the little one, is mine. I love you so much. How are you? - So embarrassed. - Ainhoa come on, tell us something. - Come on, let's go. A little something - Explain something. I won't tell you about it, you two gossips. - Gossips? - No. It was good. It was very... very nice, very romantic. And, well... we almost opened a hole in the cabin, but... - Great. - But all right. No, seriously girls, it was... it was nice. Then you know that love is built little by little, right? Says she, seeing how she ran with Gamboa. - Enjoy. - Yes. Of course you do. Of course. And a life that we don't see you smile. How can one not smile? Neither smiles nor shiny skin, or red cheeks... - You did well. - How do you know, huh. How many knows. - Go to class. - You are beautiful. - Okay. See you later. - I'm in the kitchen. Never do a thing like that in your life. Then, the boat seems to be in good condition... and there seems to be a crew. Yeah, but nobody answers. Neither the radio or acoustic signals. for now it is better not  to say anything to the crew. Julian, we will make an expedition to the yacht. There may be people alive and in need of help. We must be careful, Ricardo. that may be dead, diseased, or decaying. There's a risk of bringing  an epidemic on the ship. He's right. He's right, there may be typhoid, histoplasmosis... and if there are mice,  they may have the plague. Okay, we will take the necessary precautions, but... There may be many answers on that boat. We can not leave without checking if there are people alive. She knows her and she told me a lie. What is it, Burbuja? - What are you looking for, what's wrong? - Marimar. Salome told me a lie. She says it was just a dream, but she knows it was real. I don't buy it. Listen Burbuja. Stop for a moment. Come here. - Stop it! Stop it! - It's here. Listen, stop! What is this noise in my kitchen? - Burbuja put it down. - No. - Burbuja, put down the box. - No. - Put down the box, Burbuja! Put it down. - Get off me. Put down the box. It's Marimar. We are so close, she's my girlfriend? You're a liar, Salome. You always tell me not to tell lies... and you... you're a liar. Burbuja. North Star to Kore-Kore, can you hear me? Anyone on the Kore-Kore hear me? Over. Ricardo. I have a disorder on the finder. It's music. You must be intercepting one of the boys in the cabins. Attention this is the captain speaking... no one move, I want absolute silence... turn off the music equipment and electronic equipment. That's an order. Whats happening now? It's coming from the yacht. How long has it been playing? Dad, you have a minute? Half. Tell me. I wanted to ask... if... if lately I seem less smiling. In what sense do you mean less smiling? Of course you smile. Right now you're smiling. No, I mean if lately I seem to smile less, less than before. Before what? This is a trick, right? Listen, what would your mom have said? Nothing, it's alright. Really, don't worry. Alright. Ainhoa, are you okay? Yes, yes, yes. It was just a question, it's okay. You are smiling. Why shouldn't I? Right? - I go to the laundry. - Ainhoa. The next time I'll wash your hair. I'm also pleased to make you smile. Hello. Did you know... time of recycle, let the worms fishing in jars of shampoo? Yeah. Something wrong? Ulises, you love me? We live in the same cabin. We are together, right? We are together. But you're in love with me? Why do you love me? Why? Julia, I'm not going to live with the first person who asks me. Since when do you explain love? Well, I have the impression that you're with me because you can't be with her. Between us there will never be more than there is now, right? - You're leaving me? - No. I'm just saying... love does not grow gradually. It comes in an instant and that's how I feel. While you... I don't know how you feel. Vilma, who wanted to... What is he doing? What's up? Burbuja, what would you do with that? I'm going to recover Marimar. - You're going to look in the bottom of the sea? - No. When I had the accident it had formed the blood clot... well... I lost my memories. If I remove the blood clot, I'll find them. Vilma, what is he talking about? He dreamed of a girl and wants  to remember her by moving the clot. Not a girl, no. My girlfriend. - Okay, put this back in its place. - No, leave it. No. A blood clot in the brain does not move like a maraca. In the hospital they could not take it off. It is formed under a pressure of six atmospheres. And the pressure will disappear. - Do not touch him. No. - We'll find another way. I know that I will never have a girlfriend. Never again. I know. No one will love me in this state. Why don't I have the right to remember being loved? Of course you do. Vilma, no. - Leave it Vilma. No No. - Ahinoa, listen. What's the worst that can happen? He busts of oxygen? So what? Come on, you never splurged for love? Come on. Come on. Fuck. Please note that you fold. Got a second? Well, actually I'm a little busy. It's for Burbuja. What has he done now? I think he's starting to remember. Today he asked me about Marimar. Are you sure? What did you say? You didn't tell him anything, right? - hurting him is the last thing I want. - Yeah. However, in a ship so small you can't hide a lie so big. The boat is ready for starboard. Julian, don't get on that ship. You know that I have a sixth sense... there is something that doesn't convince me. Come on, be calm, honey. Everything will be fine, you'll see. Everything. Regardless of what we will find on that ship... or Roberto. Trust me. Be careful. Of course. De La Cuadra is waiting on deck. They have already prepared the Zodiac. Are you okay? Julia... if I may ask... how it goes living together? In short, sharing the cabin with a new person and everything. I don't know. My... my relationship with Ulises is not... I feel insecure. You just defined 90 percent of relationships when... they move in together. Live, Julia, let yourself go. In love... you can not choose. You're right. Here. It will bring you luck as I take care of your ship. That's it. I go on deck. Hey. Is anyone there? What's up, Ricardo? There must be someone. If there is someone, they are sick or have died. You see it's a trap. Julia, do you copy, over? Tell me, Captain. Turn off the engines in the engine room. I do not want the ship to approache. We don't know yet what's in here, over. Roger that, captain, but always keep the radio on, even if we make eye contact. Got it. Over and out. How are you? You will need a lot of soap to take away all that fat. Should I call someone to help you? Don't be far from me. If this is for the hair, I can wash yours tomorrow. Remember when I said to leave Ahinoa alone, or you would wake up in a box? You're absolutely right, you told me. Then turn the motors off, and look for a chest. I want a nice one, but not too luxurious. Is anyone there? Have you seen the head of machinery? The captain wants us  to NOT turn the engines on. Yes, I was helping Ulises to empty the oil tank. We started to clean the circuit, right? If you need help with anything, I will be in class correcting  the exercises, okay? Okay, you've always got your thumbs up. Okay? And at the first strange  motion we pull you out of there. Okay? We have not made love. Neither love nor anything else. I fell asleep. Or I fell asleep to not make love, I don't know. I don't know. I believe, in my opinion, the story between you and Gamboa it's just in your head. You're so adamant that you just won't admit that you're wrong. I'm not adamant and I'm not wrong. Well, you listen to your hormones, hormones are wise. Except mine. Mine are idiots. What the hell happened here, Ricardo? Where is everybody? I don't know. But it is evident that they survived the catastrophe. Maybe they drowned. Life jackets are in place. They all fell while fishing? I don't know, Ricardo, maybe they wanted to commit suicide. Because they couldn't  see land, I don't know. And they prepared a last supper that they never consumed? Stop, there is too much pressure. No, he still has his thumbs up, he's fine. If he breathes too much oxygen he will suffer lung damage. He's fine. Well, I think... that love which comes gradually is more affection. For a dog, for a grandchild. Yes, your boyfriend either you love him or don't love him. And what is between you and Piti? - Affection, like a teddy bear? - I don't know. No. Not love, of this I am certain. In fact, for me the boys are already to be discarded as such. But Piti... - No! - Yes! - No! - Yes! Piti is to be discarded even as a pet. I'll know to say, my friend. Burbuja! You're a shit, Roberto. Burbuja! Burbuja! You have to pull him out! - Hello. - Sorry. Hello. How was your day? - Good. - Just good? Very good. Roberto, what's happening? You're never home. I don't know what to do, you're either  in the lab, always with your secrets. You know I can't tell you anything. And even if I told you, your little brain could not understand. Alright? When did you become an asshole? Please leave this shit, I want you to leave the job and  bring back the boy I fell in love. Don't talk nonsense. Fell in love, you say. Strange that you are not pregnant to keep me close. You could not wait to take it off, right? You're a shit, Roberto. You do not deserve the love of anyone. - Vilma! - We need to get him out. Hey! Shit! Shit! Okay, okay, Ahinoa, listen go get help, call Julia, go call Julia, run. Burbuja! Roberto! Roberto! First lesson: those who fight with anger, do not think. And those who don't think, misse the shot. What were you saying about anger? Second lesson: the first shot is fine, but who delivers the last one wins. Come on. I don't understand what happened. There are no signs of violence, no clue, nothing. Well, food that is not missing. We collect everything and get out of here as soon as possible. And the bracelet? I got it from Julia. She says it will bring us luck. Why didn't you say you like her? - Why would I tell you, if she is with your son? - So what? You are my brother. In the end, it is you who has to decide. Julian, where am I going with her, I'm a widower with two daughters? - A woman like that... - What is wrong with you? If I was woman, I'd love you, I would tell you. But if you are always sad, without anything to offer. Nothing? But you're great! Being with you brings only benefits, Ricardo. You're a great father, a responsible man, you have lived, traveled, have a steady job. Of course I'm in love, Ricardo, Of course I fell in love. - Where are we going to live? - Stop it, come on. Come on, let's get out of here. I don't want it to be dark and  you want to kiss me or whatever. Thief, I'm crazy about you. Hey, Julian. It's a camera. In my opinion, you don't give a fuck about Ainhoa. You fight for other reasons. And you are not a professor, for anything. That noise, is your vertebrae. I'm also not a doctor. Burbuja! What has happened? We can not take it of. Come on, help me to lift him up. - Come on, Burbuja! - Up! - Come on! - Be careful! Sit him down. - Burbuja! - Fuck, it was oxygen, pressure was barely there. You have to remove this, he is suffocating in there. I can't! Roberto! Roberto! Roberto! Roberto! Roberto! Would you rather I go get Marimar? - Enough! Enough! - Julian. Julian, come here. VIDEO: Come here, come on. Look. Resume mom.  Look look.  Always the clown.  bore. Stop it!  - Go way.   - Hello.  Poor people. - Gimmie... So, then... - Shit, Dad, always the same!  Now I get you. Come on.  Are you okay?  They were also attacked by birds. Dad in the kitchen.  I ask the favor of giving up the camera, Come on.  We must prepare for this. Look good.  Look good. Come on. Bring it on? Come on, upstairs.  This is for me?  Look, it took the bait!  Look!  - They took the bait. - Well!  - worse than a child. - Beautiful.  - Dad, come on! - Baby.  - Daddy, look! - What is it?  - What is it? There, at the bottom. - What?  Let's get away from here. Are you out of your mind... or are you a murderer? Are you a murderer, Gamboa? Tell me? You wanted to teach me a lesson, below... or did you want to kill me? Did you want to kill me? I don't know, I was improvising, but you got your girlfriend and now we'll never know. Last warning. Last lesson: for you, I'm nobody. Come on. What's going on? It's impossible, Julia, we need tools. Ok. I'm going to look for them in the engine room, okay? No! We have no time. Burbuja is about to faint. - Burbuja, Burbuja! What's going on? - Relax, Salome. - Wait a minute. - That's it. - Burbuja, honey. - Hey! Fuck. Move. Get out of the way. Look at me, my darling. Love, relax. Look at me, please, honey. Burbuja, honey. - I am here, my darling. - Hey, wake up! - Honey, look at me. Do not fall asleep. - Hey, please! - Roberto! Julia, please, he won't respond. - Julia! Roberto, honey. - Is that liquid nitrogen? - Yes. Get the ax. If we freeze the bolts perhaps it will break. Remove your hands. Roberto, honey. Wait. - Now! Come on. - Ainhoa, go. Come on, baby, hit is hard. Roberto! Ok. Done. Come on. One, two, three. Pull. Burbuja. - Burbuja, honey. - Leave him to me, Salome. Burbuja, hey! - Wake up! - Open your eyes. I'm sorry. What a fright you gave us! Did you take out the blood clot? - What happened to you? - Nothing. Nothing... I wanted to fry an egg, I bumped into an open door, I slipped with the egg, I bumped into a table, I dropped a tray on my head and from there went out a pen, Where by chance it enters  and a blind eye remains. Yes, yes, of course. And the doctor didn't  put any patch on it? No, I didn't want to  put any patch on it. I was joking. You are very lucky to be with someone like Julia. You deserve it. I don't know, the ship is small... and we want to look at the floor every time we pass eachother, right? And after the worms in your head... Well, there's a little more confidence. That sucks. Friends? - Friends. - Alright. I agree. Must be very few remaining on the ship. You're not going to drink it? Drinking alone and without anything to celebrate is bad, right? I don't know what to do. I don't know, if you  want I'll keep it and... when you have something to celebrate call me and we'll drink it together. And plus... soon it will be the last on the planet. Take it. - Am I interupting? - No, I was leaving. - Are you sure? - Sure. You were right, I'm not true to myself. And I don't smile. I will leave Gamboa. How are you? How are the kids? Disappointed by the news that there was nothing on the boat. but well. How's Ulises? I don't know. But I will take your advice  and let myself go. I like it, and... as you said, I have no alternatives, right? Then there was nothing on the boat? When we arrived we were not, but... there was someone on the  yacht when we spotted it. And how do you know? We found this. Look. Dad, what's that? At the bottom.  But who was filming? And why didn't they respond to our signals? And where did they go? What happened to you? The husband who... has discovered and has not done so much pleasure, I went around to the hairdresser. Yep. At 12, in the laboratory we need to talk. It would have been easier to knock on the door than to write. Yeah. And I was looking for  neutral territory. Then I have something to fear? It depends. Julia... I'm with you 100%. And if what we have  now is not enough for you, for me it's more than I've ever had. You have just broke the last volumetric pipette in the world. Well... at least it made a better end than the others. When did you become an asshole? You're a shit. Roberto, you want me to go get Marimar? And you do not deserve someone to love you. Roberto? I couldn't find you. - You don't ever call me by my name. - I know. I want you to listen  to what I have to say. A few years ago  when you were born again, I made a decision for you because I thought it was the best thing. I decided to put it all away what you had forgotten, because you couldn't  feel what you were missing. Because you could be happy. But I'm already happy. I know. I know, my darling I can't tell lies. I can't. It is right that I return what is yours. I... I don't want to know anything. I don't want to. Here are all my friends, I love you and I'm happy. I have only good memories. And if in the box  there was a bad memory? No. - I love you. - I do more. A minute ago, the fog was not there. - What is it? - They have taken away the radar stabilizer. I'm not going to  live with a violent person. You were right when you said  that we don't know eachother. Because no one leaves me. Will you marry me? Look I just created the perfect woman. - You didn't put anything of Vilma? - No, no. She doesn't pass the  test of the fragmentation. If things do not work with Piti, nurse I'm not... but priest yes and I will be here. You are a bitch, murderer, and you're not getting out of here. You really think you can stop me? Ulises! Is there any reason why Ulises wanted to leave? I don't know! What happened yesterday? Why did they fight? What does it matter Why they fought? She has pulmonary edema and airway obstruction. Maybe she breathed smoke from the engine room. It's the fog. If we continue to breathe it we lose consciousness. The toxins will come to blood poisoning and we will die.
