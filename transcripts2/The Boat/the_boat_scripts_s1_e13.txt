 Previously ... Indeed an accident during starting up the particle accelerator, may have caused consequences of immeasurable proportions. If so, surely the Earth now will be very different. I think you will never see these images. But to be safe, I want you to know... I love you. And I will love you forever. Yes, but I always find a few  channels with the antenna. - But after the storm... nothing. - Here it is. Maybe we are not the only ones to have survived the storm. What's up, Ricardo?

 There must be someone. It's a video camera. - There, at the bottom. - What? But who was filming? And why didn't they respond to our signals? And where did they go? The device is a kind of transmitter. Used to send a signal indicating our position. It's sending a signal? To whom? I don't know. It not only sends signals at a great distance... it receives them too. - Now what do you want me to do? - Forget it's existence. And no matter what happens, not a word to the captain. Look I just created the perfect woman.

 - You didn't put anything of Vilma? - No, no. Vilma didn't pass the fragmentation test. Well, you lie continuously... convincing yourself that you're not in love... must be exhausting, no? No. No, no, no. I am in love with Vilma? What do you think? - Female. - Female. What should be here with you... Is Piti. Piti no, Palomares. Forget Piti. If things do not work with Piti... I am no nurse, but father yes and I'll be here, okay? - So, is the thing true the other day? - What thing? - That you've always loved me. - Yes. This watch was your grandfathers. It's very important to me. And I wish that for you it was. If there was something wrong, you'd tell me... right? Sure. I have cancer? Prostate cancer. I... have seen just tumor markers. I can only give you these. Will you do me a favor, Doctor? Don't tell anyone. You like a girl and you let a  scoundrel like Gamboa take her away. Forget Ainhoa... or one day you'll wake up in one of those boxes and while it sinks. I don't think you care anything about Ainhoa. You fight for other reasons. And you are not a professor. Final lesson: for you, I'm nobody. You're right when you say we don't know eachother. Because nobody leaves me. You are a fucking murderer and you will not go. We're missing a lifeboat. Why are you doing this? You could let  me bleed to death, throw me into the sea... and get rid of a problem. So you can explain to Ainhoa why You spied on her months before boarding. In the drawer under his bed there is a double bottom. The photos are there. We searched the cabin of Gamboa. No sign of the photos. Someone must have taken them. What was that? - Where is Gamboa? - We only found Ulises. That's not possible. - Who are you? - Why don't you ask Julia? What does Julia have to do with all this? By any chance do you know anything about her? Where she's from? Who she is? I propose to call the election. I volunteer. Maybe they're right. No one speaks to command the ship, but only of civil life, every day things. Who are you, Julia? - How are you, Ramiro? - Murderer! You killed Gamboa. And you can pretend that nothing has happened, but I won't. We demand that you judge Ulises for the murder of Gamboa. Gamboa is gone and they want answers. And I don't have any. No matter what he says. I know my son is not a murderer. I love you. Will we ever be a normal couple? Flowers when they come out of the pot. Captain, we found Gamboa. Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET The cookies are gone. Captain, we found Gamboa. - What is it, Captain? - It's nothing. Nobody go on deck! - I think... - They found Gamboa. - How? - Gamboa is alive? - Ainhoa... - What? Gamboa! Let me through. - Out of the way! - Come on! Out of the way! I don't feel his pulse. One, two, three, four. Since we are on this ship, almost every day amazing things happen... that are difficult to understand. It's a miracle! And when people don't know how  to explain the things that happen... they say it's a miracle. Sometimes miracles are positive, other times they are scary. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Although some people do not believe in miracles. - Careful! - As, for example, Uncle Julian. Miracles do not exist. Maybe they didn't exist  before the world sank, Dad. Come here. But my uncle was wrong. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. It was just a miracle  to happen on the North Star. What's going on? - It a cell phone. - In fact, miracles would be two. The second was that the bad man who knows all our secrets, was to resurrect. Relax. Relax. My mom said that misfortunes never come singly. - It's my phone. - How is that possible? Maybe the same thing happens with miracles. They begin to happen, and they never end. I don't remember anything. I don't know how I ended up in the sea. I just know that I survived... knowing that... you'd be here waiting for me. Ramiro, it can't be your cell phone! It's absurd! Hello! What are you doing? Listening to the gentlemen on the radio. Careful! Gamboa! Hey! - Message received. - Come on! - What do you mean? What are you saying? - That's not true! Gamboa! Gamboa! Gamboa! Breathe! Gamboa! What's going on? El Barco 1x13 - Waiting for a miracle - Translation and synch: miahu, Saropula, Alle83, johanna.p, ziomele Revision: Allison Captain, how is it that  suddenly there is a signal? How strange! We all have the same message. - An SOS with numbers. - Not numbers, they are coordinates. Someone is sending a request for help. But how can they send out an SOS, Captain? If there is no signal... Sure, there's no land, so there are no antennas. An antenna doesn't have to be on land. It can fit on a ship, in a very large ship, like a carrier, or ice-breaker, with a huge relay to transmit over long distances. We are at one night's journey from this place. If we leave now, we arrive at dawn. Captain, you're not thinking of going  to the coordinates, right? Oh yes. Just as I went to look for you when you  left in the boat during a storm. We don't know why they ask help. We don't know if they are on top of a volcano... if they have an epidemic or what. We don't know if it's a trap, fuck! Enough! Damn it! Listen. Please. What it takes, Ramiro? The lack of red meat has clouded your brain? Do you realize how important this is? Don't you understand? That message, which is for help or  whatever, I don't care. Someone sent it. Yes. Someone... someone else who has survived the catastrophe, like all of us. We are not alone in the world, man! Come on! We will celebrate with champagne, champagne! Let's celebrate! All sailors on deck. We raise the sails. I want all the trimmings, master and mizzen, route to the north-west. There are people alive, Salome. - Beautiful. - All I want is you to be alive, the rest I don't care. Give me a kiss. What are you doing, where are you looking? Me? I don't know. I'm distracted. - With the noise... - Yeah. Since when do you kiss your  girlfriend with your eyes open? You have been standing there like an owl. Salome. Leave me. Hello. He's been unconscious for two hours. And he... appears so suddenly, half dead and I don't... - it's... all very strange because I don't... - Okay. Ainhoa... I'd be back rowing, swimming, or surfing in the wake of the ship, - If I was your boyfriend. - Yes, yes, but he's not my boyfriend. Okay? Because we broke up shortly before he disappeared, but now he doesn't remember and... - I don't know how to tell him to go again. - Relax, relax. Is anyone there? - Hello. - What did you say? I would have been  all my life locked in the hold. And, thanks to the return of Gamboa, I am free, Ainhoa. What you wanted to kiss with your boyfriend  still in the mortuary? Don't do it. - Idiot. - You can't make your own. Listen. Take the time you need. But if at midnight you  talked to him, I'll be here... for a walk on the deck. However, if you come... you must bring a flower. Why? It's a surprise. Alright. Come in. Ricardo. The wind blows from the stern. We'll get to the coordinates ahead of schedule. It's a miracle that Gamboa has come so far in this inflatable boat. Seven days ago Gamboa threw the boat into the sea to leave the North Star. Ulises tried to stop him. Accidentally shot him in the shoulder blade. Then they both fell into the water. The toxic gases almost killed us,  including Gamboa and Ulises. In the end, thanks to Burbuja, we  found Ulises floating in water. But there was no trace of the boat, nor Gamboa. Until today. Around 250 miles from where he disappeared... and in front of the star. It took us a week to make that journey,  with a brig of 75 meters... sailing upwind and in a straight line. Honestly... it doesn't make much sense that  we found him in front of us. I think he should give us much explanation. And he's not the only one. I say that. Because who knows how to explain, Ainhoa and Ulises... they are together. Hell, Ricardo. If this works... we will be in-laws! You and me. His eyes were like an owl. "I'm distracted," he says. But, for me, when I kiss him it's as if the world stopped. Okay, forget about it, Salome. There are only anchovies? Really there is nothing more sweet? Please. You have to give me a real  kiss with your eyes closed. If you give with your eyes open  it's because you're hiding a lie. My grandmother, Avelina, always told me that. - I love you. - Me too. So you know, right? What? No, I didn't want to come to know... that there is another, but... Yes, with that of 2 ? B, you think? You're stupid, you're stupid or are you stupid? Salome, come on, that De La Cuadra was in love with you for 20 years, please! Maybe... Instead of thinking ill, you could do something romantic, right? Don't you think? Me? Romantic? What do I do romantic? Want me to show you something? Okay. For three days I find ducks paper. In a cabinet, on the bed, between the books... seems like a stupid thing, but I don't know, somebody is leaving them for me. For me. Piti, for sure. I'll tell you one thing, Salo. Romance is not dead. Have you been to heaven? I heard you on the radio. Ah, yes? Before I heard the voice of my mother, and then I heard you. Well, it wasn't me. Leave me your doll? No. Why? Because I don't like you. That seratina. You are playing dice with food? You are crazy. - Come on, bring it back to the kitchen. - This is our food, Palomares. We put away a little at a time. We are free to gamble, okay? Well, free, free. Some are not at all. Right, father? It's just that in the world of the priesthood, There are many prohibitions. A priest, for example, can not play dice. Nor have... impure thoughts. Nor wet dreams. But most of all... a priest can not kiss his friends. But yes you can play games, win and put the food in the kitchen. Certainly. If you have something to gamble away. So, Ricardo... I tell you that we become relatives and you start to do the math? What the hell is wrong with you? Do you like the kids together? Well, no. What is it? My son... is not good enough? No. Julian. Ulises is how he is. He's a wind vane. Today he is with Julia and  tomorrow with my daughter. But Ricardo, it's not like that. My son liked Ainhoa from day one. Ah, even worse. What was Julia? A hobby? He hurt her on a whim, nothing more than that. I'm sorry. But if we are talking about tantrums, I think you're the one that wins your daughter, fuck. Who goes to live with Gamboa, and meanwhile gets together with my son. And I haven't even seen her in mourning, when she learned that he was dead. Are you calling my daughter a slut? And are you calling my son... an asshole? The captain lies.  You can choose to stay   in rabbits or mine team.  But I will not accept more lies.  Why does he have three passports?  He's got three different identities.  In Gamboa's cabin I also found a folder,  with photos of Ainhoa,   when she was still on land,  We searched the cabin of Gamboa.   No sign of the photos.  The photos were there.  Someone must have taken them.  The scale loses to the color, and we go three shots. Palomares, if you bet with those, what will you give with communion? With clams, Estela. With clams. Don't worry. Fuck, Father. A priest who plays the body of Christ. Since you touched the flesh... you've unleashed a lot, huh? Right, sir? How is he? Stable. He was a week adrift. Many days. It's likely that he recovered a little. I left him before... he disappeared and he can't remember. Do you think he might have amnesia? Yes. It's possible that he has amnesia. It's called psychogenic fugue... or dissociative fugue. But don't worry, the re-establishment  is a matter of time. How... how long? I need to talk to him. Well, look, I don't know how long. At this time it is important not to alter it. Because it is dangerous for his recovery. You'll probably have to wait to leave him again. Will you excuse me? Yes. Ulises. The cookies for you. After one week in the hold, you look thin. Thank you very much. You have no idea what to give to your father? He gave me the ring of "forever",  I do nothing for him. I don't know, honestly. Well... yesterday he gave me his fathers the watch. Maybe you could go to the mall and buy one. A nice one. That's stupid, right? What can I give him, in the middle of the end of the world? There's not nothing left. Salome! There's one thing we could give him. My father always says that eating no bread, stuff is stupid, you know how he is. The bread is finished by day. You're looking at me as if you had seen a ghost. Am I dead, by chance, Doctor? The gunshot wound. It has healed perfectly. There is no pus, there is no infection... What do you mean by that? Well, either you're a superhero or you got... antibiotics of the latest generation. The first-aid kit on the lifeboat works miracles. you don't even show signs of dehydration. You don't have dry skin... nor mucous... - nor sunken eyes... - Doctor... I have a strong metabolism. Insulin? In your medical history It  didn't say you were diabetic. An insulin injection ten minutes  before you boarded the ship may cause a sudden hypoglycemic shock. We all have our secrets. You have yours... I have mine. And neither of us... will tell the captain. Medical degree. Expert in biochemistry and  physics at the Sorbonne. You are fluent in French and English. You have an excellent resume. We had no doubt as to your incorporation to Protocol B the particle accelerator. In fact, we granted you the freedom... to draw your contract. I don't know if it's a mistake... there are too many zeros in my salary... Welcome to the ECND, Miss Wilson. You'll have to find an apartment in Geneva. What are you doing? I'm watching a movie. "It's a wonderful life." It's not a DVD, it's TV. The TV is back! It's not possible, Burbuja. Yes it is possible. Because I tuned in and it had already begun. I've seen it twice. When it finishes, it starts again. Look, here comes Uncle Billy with a basket full of money. Look how much money. How is Gamboa? Keep going, keep going. I can wait. Well, if you have personal things... I come back later. It's not personal, it's professional. Ah, I have a professional matter. How is Gamboa? - Stable. - Julia... it's impossible for the boat to exceed the ship. - I need to talk to him. - No. He just had a hypoglycemic shock. - He's very weak. - Weak? But he is well, look at him. He would have suffered a week of bad weather. He hasn't even lost weight. - To me he seems the same as before. - Gamboa is of stocky build. I'm not talking about size. I'm telling you that he disappeared  in strange circumstances and reappeared in circumstances even more strange. At 400 km, just when the ship received an SOS. - Julia, we need answers. - Gamboa is suffering from amnesia due to a deficiency of glucose and sodium. He has an iron deficiency and  is in advanced dehydration. If you go in there, you  won't get anything from him. He's my patient, Captain. And as long as he is in the infirmary, he will not talk to anyone. Captain... can you go to the club immediately, please? Roger that, be right there. No, no, please. No. And the dealer wins again, yes! They tell me that Estela leaves the game for lack of credit. Gentlemen, let's be honest, the important  thing is not to participate, it's to win. Come on, Piti, that food was not mine... It was the girls. I wanted to surprise them. Now I can't go back to them and tell  them that I gambled it all in dice. Sure. I don't know, Estela... ask for a loan. Or for a promissory note. But if you can't bet, you can go cry on deck. So, gentlemen, anyone want to accompany her on deck? To me it is pretty good, I guess. - Do you accept clothes? - Estela... - Don't do it, come on. - No, wait. I accept them, I accept them. But I don't know if the priest... will agree because... He is a bit sensitive to the call of the flesh. You know? - Then, father, you retire or... - We accept clothes. Don't make a fuss and continue. - What is this? - "It's a wonderful life." With James Stewart and Donna Reed, directed by Frank Capra in 1946. It's about a miracle. And there are angels. It's been repeating for three hours. When it finishes, it starts again. Maybe it is from the ship  to where we're going, right? That is, a ship-cinema? - Makes no sense. - Maybe they're sending a signal, Dad. Look, now he jumps into the river. And an angel saves him. Well, whatever it is, we wait until tomorrow morning to see this. So, come on, everyone to sleep. Up to the cabins. Captain, can we stop a little to watch TV? And it's been so long since we felt well, at home. Alright. Three, I won. Gentlemen, I think we'll see the  first full nudity of the evening. You must remove the sacred shroud, Father. Well, girls food doesn't  matter girls, the game is over. You want to admit once and for all you have a crisis of faith? It doesn't matter. You are a priest and Pope at the same time. You can put an end to  celibacy even now, if you want. - Piti. - Do you? Piti, it is not funny. Well, yes, maybe I'm going through a crisis of faith. And may be it is not  up to me to light the path of anyone. But a fool who gambles the  food at a time like this. Piti, you do not deserve to be the  father of child Vilma's child. So let's do this. I gamble the collar. If I lose... I give up being a priest. But if I win... you give up being the father of Vilma's  child and I'll take care of it. Fine. I agree. Estela... the nuts. Get it up. Come on, I want to know who won. Why don't you kiss her once and for all? Why don't you kiss her and stop saying stupid things? You want me to kiss her, huh? Ah, these young people today! Burbuja. Burbuja, come. Come here. Listen, go to the captain and tell him something on my part. - Now? - Yes, now. - Go and tell him... listen! - Yes. Tell him that his daughter is the  one that clings to my son. Got it? Tell him to come here, so he sees it. Let's see if he has the courage to continue to piss me off. Come on, that's an order. Captain... the first officer wants you to go to the club, we are looking at the film of the miracle. So what? And Ainhoa is there... and that she is clinging to Ulises. Burbuja, now go... and tell him that clung a nice punch, and that will serve him for a miracle  to make up for all that he said. Go on, tell him. The captain says that... What? Well, he thought about what you said... - And? - And... - Go ahead, fuck. - Well, he's sad. And if there is more brandy. Is there still some cognac? Yes. Where are you going? You don't want to drink now? Tell him... that even if he pulls back now, nothing changes. It is not enough Berci above to erase the disappointment. He says that... that the miracle is to have you as a captain. He says he is happy that the world no longer exists, to continue to sail with  you another thousand years. And no one will change the fact  that you are the last family in the world. And that Ulises is like a son to him. And Ainhoa is like a daughter to him. Can I go watch the movie now? Yes, go. - Thank you. - Your welcome. - Honey... - Hello. - I stay to watch the movie. - Yes, go, go. Ricardo, fuck. So what? Will you help me? Okay, I'll do a shot... and off with the lifeboat, right? Okay, come on. I'm sorry, it's late, I must go. I stay to watch the movie, because they are made really well. - It's moving. - Alright. I'm sorry. Pardon me. CONTAINS MEDICINE How many bags of water does the lifeboat have? Twenty. Ricardo... Julia is lying to us. But why? I don't know, but you have to talk to her. I don't like this at all. There they are. I can not sleep. Why? The radio will not stop playing. It is good to know that friends when leaving the ship, continues to be so when you come back from the dead. It was a good idea to take you into my team. Team? What team? You used me and lied from the very beginning. What is this? When you're gone I have saved your things. I thought Ulises killed you and I wanted him to be condemned. So I hid these so he couldn't defend himself. But you're alive! So now you tell me who you are. And why you had this among your things. It's true. I spied on Ainhoa. I started to follow her when I discovered that she would be traveling on this ship. Why? Because she was the daughter of the captain. I told you I wouldn't have lied, Ramiro. But there are things I can not tell you... for now. You can go, but if you want to be at my side, you have to play by my rules. The fruit was finished weeks ago from where did you get this apple? I told you that there are things I can not tell you... for now. Take it as a gift. It's a way to thank you. If you're interested... Ainhoa is with Ulises. I think they're together. Look, I'm sorry, but... I have a date. Yes, I have a date too. Oh, yeah? Mine would have come with a flower in her hair. Are you my date? - Nice to meet you, Ulises. - It's a pleasure. I could not talk to Gamboa. But you know what? I'm not interested in him. Really, I don't care. Alright, and what? Where are you taking me? Let's take a dip? What do you mean? Let me do it. - Let me do it! - No, no, huh? Look over there, see? No, no, no, no. I do not want to swim. They told me another place to project a film. I think it's better than what they have on TV. But it's late, surely it will have already begun. Don't worry. It broadcasts continuously. No, no, no, no! Doctor! I want an explanation. - I don't know what you mean. - Yes, you do. You know that Gamboa was adrift for seven days. And has consumed only one of the twenty bags of water he was carrying. Not even a liter in seven days. You also know that he had a wound in the shoulder blade. And he didn't even opened an  antibiotic that was on the boat. Look, I was not there on that boat. When Gamboa will recover, you may ask him. I'm not an idiot, Doctor. He is deceiving us all, and you are covering for him. You know that it is impossible to have  remained on that lifeboat for seven days. So tell me now what's going on. - I order you, doctor. - I don't know! I can't tell you, because I don't know. Why are you giving me two phones? You will report back on everything  related to this investigation for two different departments. You will have two passwords to speak with each of your supervisors. Do not make any personal phone call, and do not give anyone these numbers. Comprende-vous? Oui, monsieur. And these are the terms of discretion. There are 125 clauses. Why? You have been admitted to a  maximum-security project, Miss Wilson. More than thirteen countries  involved in the project Alexandria. And for reasons of national security, we must be sure that no one can put it at risk. I told you ... my film is much better than that of the TV. The incident will also have destroyed the world, but some good things have not gone away. Such as... Such as? Such as what? Such as kisses. What? where are you going, snitch? Kisses are the best thing in the world. Has it ever happened that... you love a person so much that you could spend your entire life kissing them? Only kisses. And suddenly a thrill runs through your neck. And you can't stop kissing them. Until your jaw starts to hurt. Close your eyes. No. What if I don't like it? I don't know, if you kiss me and it doesn't work... What if.. What? Nothing. Are you sure that these are the coordinates? 23 degrees, 0 first, north, 102 degrees, 0 first, ext. It's here. - The doctor say anything? - That she doesn't know anything. Of course, if she doesn't know anything, I'm Paul Newman. Your father. Here, look. - How are you two lovebirds? - Good morning. Hello. How are you? What is it, Captain? The ship that launched the SOS. Theres no trace. What the fuck is this? Ricardo... Ricardo, come here, please. I don't see anything. What's up? Come on, guys. We can't see anything. There is no ship. But it makes no sense. No one sends an SOS and then disappear. Unless it's a trap. I'm trying to pick up a signal. Because if they sent an SOS, and later the film... Maybe we're being hailed by radio, but we must have a lot of TV and radio, to search through all frequencies  in medium wave and short wave. Captain... The radar doesn't detect anything. Maybe it sank. It sank after sending an SOS. We need to go down. We need to know if it sank or what. The depth is 49 meters. It's dive simple. I can go myself. Okay, but you will get  immersed tied to a rope. We don't know what happened here, nor do we know where those signals come from, or who sent them. Make one decompression of 7 minutes at 20 meters and get back. I want you back here in fifteen minutes. Got it? - Yeah. - Good. Vilma... forgive me. I was... I don't know, I was furious. I saw you kissing Palomares and I ended the mood. - Alright. - I'm sorry. When I asked you to act as a father I knew... that, in short, you're the type of  person who avoids problems. Always remains afloat... However, you are able to gamble away  the paternity of my child for nuts. - No. - It doesn't matter. Really. It could have happened today, once we touched land, or when you'd find a girl. No, wait, wait, wait. I want this baby, I swear. I swear. Vilma, Vilma, wait, please. Listen, I lost the bet and then? It doesn't matter, it's bullshit. - I want to be the father, please. - Why, Piti? - Because it is yours, Vilma. - But why? Knock it off. Vilma. Because I love you. Fuck. If I do the first day, I do the fourth. I... I didn't put any of your  parts in the perfect woman... just because... because for me, you're already so perfect. And I was a jerk and I challenged Palomares in the game, it was for this. Because I'm in love with you, Vilma. I'm in love with you. What? What? What? Nothing. Because you have the innate ability... - To ruin things? - I don't know, Vilma. I don't know. I don't know. Why the bet? I don't understand. You're already doing well with the the ducks. What ducks? What ducks, Vilma? Here, tie it tight to lampara I want a knot as God intended, okay snitch? Prove you are the captains daughter. Ulises, if you see a ship,  don't go in, okay? If there are problems tug three  times and we'll pull you out. Alright. Bring me some nice gift? Yes. See you soon, snitch. Be careful, okay? So what? Are they or aren't they a good couple? They are, Julian, they are. The couple of the year. It 's the fax. Someone is sending a message. - The other family has disappeared. - How do disappear? - Disappeared. They were not there. - Julia. - Julia. - Ask her. Julia. Julia, why is Ulises diving? Where is the ship we had to help? I know nothing, for now. Doctor tell us what's going on. No one says anything. Relax. Listen to me. The captain will have an explanation. Relax. The same SOS to the same coordinates. What's going on? Daddy, daddy...  I no longer hear the gentlemen on the radio. Now there's music. It's that music. What's going on? The same song. That was on the yacht when the family disappeared. There's a lot of signals. It's bombing the ship signals. - Do they want to tell us something? - Are they going to take us? Let's get out of here. Retrieve Ulises. I'll take away Valeria and control the others. He has not yet ascended? Come on, honey. Burbuja, all off, let's go. Captain, what is this music?  What's happening? There's no trace of the ship. The ticker went crazy and all frequencies have this music. You don't know why? You don't know whats happening? Nor do you know where we are? Or because someone sends us a message and then disappears. Don't you know that? What do you want? Julia, what are you doing? You can't give up. You can't leave work now. I made my decision. You can't, Julia. You signed, you understand? Do you really think they'll let you go, with all that you know? What can they do to me? Kill me? Philippe. Philippe. Philippe... It's been more than 8 minutes, Uncle Julian. He's had plenty of time for decompression. Fuck it all. Pull him up. Alright. What the fuck? Shit. Relax. I'll dive. You didn't come to see me lastnight. Listen Palomares,  I want to give you some advice. Never try to earn a living with dice. The priesthood and the game do not get along. Yes. There are many things that do not go together with the priesthood. - Problems with faith? - No. It's not that. it's because the world is over and now I have doubts about God And that... Yesterday I kissed you. And now... I have doubts about myself. Look. Maybe for you it is strange, because you're a priest... but people kiss all the time and nothing happens. It was a stupid, innocent kiss. It's not that important, really. Really? That's really what you think? No. No. I... doesn't answer that, it's true.  You're right, it's... it's true, yes. Maybe because I'm not used to... that... that doesn't... I don't feel... What is it? Are you the one with the ducks? Why? Well... I like to see you smile. That's it. Bye. Before I finished we left you in the sea, Gamboa. No. They didn't leave me. You left me. And I told you that no one leaves me. See? In the end there are things you never forget. I had in my hands the lives of Ulises three times. It's amazing what a bit of co2 can do when it's injected into the cylinder valve for divers. Ulises. - Dad... - Ainhoa. If you don't want to be with me, I respect your decision. But you won't be with anyone else. Hello. Ainhoa, I'm here. Ainhoa. There will be a fourth time. The next time... I'll kill him. And then your father. And, of course, your little sister. You have three lives in your hands. And Valeria is the last child of the world. It would be a sin. And you know I would. - Are you sure? - Yes. Here the ship-school North Star. ID number 100855. Spanish flag. 0034 1677 654 886. We find ourselves at the coordinates. Can you hear me? Here ship-school North Star. Captain. What does this music mean? Sorry guys, but I don't know. And I don't even know what had the messages. But it's clear that there's nothing here. So I order you to stay together, as we prepare to weigh anchor. Ricardo, Ricardo. Can you come on deck? Now. Calm down. We're leaving now. But at least give us an answer. What happened? There was nothing down there, Captain. No trace of the wreck. But there was this floating adrift. Look. The paper is perfectly glued. Therefore it couldn't have  been in the water for long. Not to mention the iron in the sea, begins to oxidize after four hours or so. So someone was here less than four hours ago. Can I go for a moment? Alright. We're getting out of here now ourselves. - Are you okay? - Yes. A little tired. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Come on, go to sleep. - No, I'm fine. Julian, it's an order. Here ship-school North Star. 16776. Here ship-school North Star. 65488... ship-to-school North Star. Ship-school North Star,... 855... Spanish flag. Here ship-school North Star. Is someone there? - Hello. - I have a surprise for you. I spent a sleepless night, shaking sacks of flour, and scraping the bottom of the drawers. It's a little dull. But it is bread. You did it for me? And why? I don't know what to say. Not even I knew what to say, when you asked me to become your wife. Now I don't want anything more out of life. That's good. Thinking of staying with someone forever gave me vertigo. But now "forever" it seems to me a very short time. I love you. Me too. What is it? My legs are trembling. For the dizziness that you say. We're getting married. - Immediately. - How? What do you say? Do you want to be my wife? - Now? - Now. Didn't you just say "forever" seemed to you a short time? You want me? Yes. Then I I hereby declare... husband and wife. Then I will kiss the groom. Since the project began, everyone involved are working  with someone on their side. A kind of facilitator. A facilitator? For what? So that work becomes easy. But above all, to ensure that, if things go wrong, everything ends for the best. And they have my same information? No. Different. But remember that you are in the project together. I want you to meet Mr. Gamboa. Pleasure. I can't take anymore. 1,006 01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:32,287 What are you doing here? Why did you come back?
