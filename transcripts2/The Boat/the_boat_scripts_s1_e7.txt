 Ulises, Ulises... - What's up? - May I? Sure. I wanted... I wanted to thank you. For saving my father. And because you took care of us on the ship. You're welcome. Can you go, please? - What? - That's why you come to my bed? What do you mean?

 It looks like you will be taking pleasure  in staying in the same bed with me. I'm not the spare wheel of anyone. I'm not your toy, or your doll. What bullshit. Maybe you don't want to sleep with your boyfriend. Because you remember... a few days ago he was going to kill your father. You are an early bird. In the Middle Ages, thieves got a  hand cut off. Which do you prefer? I have a right to eat. Let me go. Blood. Blood, blood, blood... Blood! He wanted to hit him and Gamboa defended himself. Why don't we call the captain?

 No, don't wake the captain for this. Of course, since we now have a mayor. And what? You'll be in charge of rationing and you... - punish the thieves? - The wound is serious, involving the pancreas. But with cortisone and antibiotics for 20 days, we can avoid infection. And how much cortisone is needed for this treatment, Doctor? 60-70% of our stock. 34th 00:04:51,052 --> 00:04:53,707 So, if one day... 35th 00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:56,517 the captain himself, or... 36th 00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:58,296 Ainhoa... 37th 00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:01,257 were in need of cortisone, what would you say? 38th 00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,490 That we have given it to a thief? 39th 00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:09,943 - Someone stole tranquilizers. - Why don't we call the captain? 40th 00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:14,656 He always knows what is good for the ship. Just give him what he needs, doctor. Anything. Trust me, okay? you'll make it. My uncle Julian always says... that this ship is upside down. So maybe... the Earth was not submerged. Maybe the fact is that we  are in the world upside down. In the world upside down, the children would take care of the parents. The toys would be alive. And they should get up early to go to school. People would be raised at night, and would go out on  the street in their pajamas. If we were in the world upside down, I would be the person most intelligent of the ship. Hello children, today we will draw our family. I drew mine. First with a pencil, then color it. And if you get out from the edges you have a point less. Valeria, honey... What are you doing, love? We are at school, Daddy. But it is still night. Isn't that a little early? But after they are big and I can't anymore. Daddy, when do I go back to school for real? Soon, baby, soon. Not soon, very soon! Let's see... How about if we start lessons today? - Yeah? - Yes! I would love to teach you because you're the most beautiful girl in the world. - How are you in math? Can you add? - A little. But the most beautiful thing in the world upside down, is that I have a mother. - Yes. - Well. How many hours of class do we do? What time do you have, Doctor? What time is it? - Ramiro... - What? Wake up, Ramiro... look. What's up? What are you doing? The sun? Ramiro, come on. Vilma... are you okay? - Yes. - Yeah? Let's go into the dining room, come on. - Yes. Careful. That looked bad, you had nightmares? Don't look at me, and don't even talk to me. For you I don't exist on this ship. It's night. It 's still night. El Barco - 1x07 -- Lost -- Translation and synch: johanna.p, nina_bach, Alle83, ziomele Revision: Allison What is it, Julia? Why is it still night at 9:15 in the morning? Yesterday, the sun rose at 6:56 precisely. I don't know, we could be in another hemisphere. In one night? No, it's impossible. - We would've had to travel 1800 miles. - Doctor... it is impossible that the sun is off, right? Without land we can live, but... without the sun? Captain, believe me, if it did, we would not be here now. I don't understand... why it is still night? - I don't know. - Where's, Ramiro? He was down in the cabin. LOST - Vilma, are you okay? - Yes. - Yeah? - Go on. Okay, okay. Perhaps the incident has created a black hole, if so, it's possible that  the mass of the Earth... Stop, I'm sick and tired of these theories. Captain, the crew is pretty nervous. Why don't you give them one of  your speeches? To cheer them up. Ulises, would you do it? No, they're your men and they need the captain. I have a 5 year old daughter that can not go to school because... there are no more children in the world. Before being captain, I am a father. Mayor. Sir... Martinez, I wanted to apologize for the divergence. I did not mean to hurt you. Are you better? Yes, thank you professor. Don't believe that the case... is to apologize? - Yeah, I'm sorry... - Not to me. The captain. Perhaps you could write him a note. I'll help. All right. "Captain, today I robbed my mates. I did it because this situation, brings out the worst in me. I can not stand... to live adrift... knowing that we are destined to die. I'm sick... and I want to put an end to all this as soon as possible. " Relax, relax. Write in beautiful calligraphy. "I hope you understand my reasons. I'm sorry. Signed... Eduardo Martinez." 10:13am and there is dawn. That is three hours difference than yesterday. Mark the exact time, please, Julia. We need to find out where we are. If we head to the North Pole, it is possible that the sun rises later. No? Will you help me? Will you give me a hand, Dad? I need your help. In what do you need help with? This world doesn't make sense. Neither heaven or anything. All I knew to do, navigate, no longer makes sense now... we have no where to go. In what could I ever help you with? Now I am even crying when I see the sunrise. We shall see a thousand dawns. Definitely. But you can't give up hope. I need you. We're going to show this damn sea. And we will find that percent of land that still remains. We will find it. Sure. You must be brave, Dad. You have to be brave, man. Come on. Ulises... Tell me. You have to see this. What's up? Where the fuck are we? And why doesn't the compass mark north? I don't know. Maybe we are going through an area of extreme magnetic virulence. I don't know. What the fuck! Rationing. Vilma... Are Pitis traits so bad? - You're pretty grumpy with him, right? - No. Just know types like him. I was with several boys and a  friend is acceptable, that's all. Well, since he will be the father of your child you could give him a chance, right? No, no way. I would never put him in my life. Princess. Ainhoa. - Dad, I thought you were at the bridge. - Today I'm not working. Today I am going to school with Valeria as a little refresher. Then I'd invite to dinner... you and your boyfriend. There is no need. Really, things aren't going well, you don't get along and there is no need. - How is there no need? Yes, it is needed. - There is no need... And you know why? I've never seen you at the  gate of home expecting a boy, or as you kiss on a park bench. Ainhoa, this is the first boy I know and... forgive me, I was taken aback. So I want to give him a chance. And you'll see that at the end of dinner we will end up hugging. Ricardo. Do you have a minute or two? Stop it, guys. Do me a favor. Please, let's go. - What's up? - No, no, that is... we are adjusting the pipes in here... It makes no sense. Nothing works, not even the compass. Ricardo, what am I doing here if we don't even know where we are going? - It makes no sense. - It doesn't matter, Julian. If the tools do not work, well... - Settle down and stop. - Yes, of course. - This thing is not important. - And what is important? I don't know anymore. This is important, what my daughter makes, when she draws her family. She drew her mother as if she were still here, Julian. That is important. Do not worry, Ricardo. Me, your little girl, I see... I see her happy, not sad. It 's normal that she drew her mother... that she misses. She drew her long hair. Marisa led them to the headband. Ricardo, you're here to be with her, with your child, with both. To be a father and mother at the same time. What's the problem? Who says you can't? I'm here to lean in all respects, from the bridge with my son. With my son, Ricardo, because you're right. Who gives a damn about the compass. Fuck the compass, so we don't go anywhere. It's like you say, Ricardo. They are people, people, family and we must care for them, Fuck! What? Damn it! What's wrong? Tonight I'll help you move and you  come live with me. It's already too late. - So, is the thing true the other day? - What thing? You've always loved me. Yes. - And you? - Me? Well... I always, always, no... But two days yes. So, for me... it can eclipse the sun or end the world if they want. - Be my empress. - Empress? - What is it? - Coffee. Make me a caffettino? - All right, buddy. - What is it? Never heard of a good juicer? Why, you felt it? Yes sir, yes sir. The world has not disappeared, it's a sociological experiment.  Eight minutes ago me and De La Cuadra recovered the black box of a Boeing 747  this morning crashed in these coordinates.  Magnetism is created by a movement of liquid metals in the core of the planet. Maybe something has changed and for  this reason the compasses doesn't work. But values outside are normal. It seems that the only area of strong electromagnetism is here. Here exceeds 2000%. Well, actually... in fact I feel the electromagnetism. Let me see. The values of normal radiation... doesn't usually exceed 180 tesla, can you... go back out to measure, please? Yes, but if high values are in here... Why do I have to go out? I'm sorry. We were... measuring the electromagnetic... Well, I... I have class. - I had promised the captain. - Julia. Doctor. Dad. Dad, what you just saw... Cut the crap, look here. Here, look. Run, run. Julia! Julia! We're going to live together, Julian, just asked me, - Now! - That's nice. Yeah! I am very happy! What's wrong? - Oh, Salome. - What is it? - Salome, what have I done! - What did you do? I threw myself at Ulises kissing him as if I were in a club, and had drunk six gin and tonics... and in addition, his father caught. - Julian? - Please. I don't know whats happening to me. When I have him near me... - I lose myself. - Then lose yourself. How was the kiss? - It was a kiss or a kiss, kiss? - It was a kiss, kiss... - Then you are together. - No. But as I know, there has not been time. We have not spoken since. There was his father. Shit. You want to be with him? You tell him. No. As to turn the world, tomorrow the moon will fall on his head... and that would be that. Thank you. If that man is there, it means that there are other ships, right? I don't know, maybe land is not so far away, Dad. And with the doctor, something was there? They were just the little kisses... or did you go to bed? Now you want to be a father? You want to tell me the story of the little seed? - No, I want to give you some advice. - Go ahead. The lady is a little slut. Do you know who she  slept with the other night? The captain. Two days ago she was in bed with him, and now that you are the mayor, - She's with you. - So what? Do you know who I slept with the other night? With Ainhoa. It doesn't matter. - Why not? - No, never mind. I'll tell you what does matter, the  one you like is really Ainhoa, but my boy, instead of fighting, you throw in the towel  and go with the easy one. I was in love with Salome all my life, but I went with your mother, I ran away, I was terrified. And I had to disappear over the world, because I decide to move forward. Come on. Where were you? - I looked for you but couldn't find you, where were you? - Here. Listen. My father... will give you an opportunity. He wants you to go to  dinner with him tonight. - And you? - What about me? Are you sure you want to go with me? Of course I want to go with you. Why do you say that? Because... I am twenty years older than you, because I am your professor. In addition, we don't know each other much. Okay as adventure, but in the end you want to stay with someone your own age. I don't want to be with Ulises. I haven't spoken of Ulises. I want to be with you. Because I like how you sew sails... and... your dry hands... and how you use my belly as a pillow, even though sometimes it stings. and... if that wasn't enough, Well, I want to continue to find out more. Well, then we start by going to that dinner. - I heard amidships, man. - And what could I do, Palomares? If... she screams, I put a hood over her head? What hood? I'm telling you you need to do things properly. Do you like Estela? Piti, this is not an evening at Pacha, we are on a ship, adrift and we are the  only ones left in the world. What we do affects everyone, Piti. Do you like Estela or not? Get out of here! - Vilma, use your... - Get out! - Get out! Out! - Vilma! - Get out! - Stop! Are you crazy! Stop! please! Go live with your boyfriend! "I'm flying over Havana." "The island isn't there." "I repeat: the island isn't there." "Tower, if you read me, we having visibility problems, the island is not there. " "There is no land!" "7-7-9-1" "New York is gone." "There is no JFK. There is no JFK." So, keep your direction, you see? Come in. - Captain? - Yes, Burbuja? can you come with me a moment? - Where, Burbuja? - At the bridge. Look, I've told you a thousand times that the bridge are Ulises and De La Cuadra. I'm in class. Do you understand? - Yes, I understand. - A bit of silence, please. Burbuja, if you want to stay, you can sit. Let's see, who can tell me the first solution? If you have any questions, you can ask. - No matter what, ma'am? - Yes. What is a particle accelerator? Here he is. Stop the engine. I have him. Here you are. Here you are. Martinez. Martinez. - Yes, Valeria? - Do you have a boyfriend, miss? Honey, do not ask these things in class. - These things are personal. - Never mind, it doesn't matter. I did, but he's gone. And do you like someone on the ship, Doctor? Well... I think so. Well, my father likes someone on the ship too. Right, Dad? Can we take a break, we adults? Yes, yes. Stop it, Dad. Stop. Leave him. Stop. Enough. Stop. Stop it, leave him! Dad, he is dead! Leave him! Leave him! He's dead! Enough! - Enough! He's dead! - Let me, Ulises. - Drop it. Enough is enough. Dad, I can not believe that you told Valeria and not me. - Tell me now who you like. - No one. No one? - Julia. - You like Julia? You like Julia? I can't believe it. I can't believe it. - Yes. - May I? Yes, of course, come. Great. I also like someone on the ship. Good, Burbuja. I shouldn't have to tell anyone, much less to Valeria. It 's too soon. Look at what she drew this morning. She drew parents, me with a vase, and your mother alive. This is because she still thinks so much of her. This is not mom. - Why not? - This is Julia. She has long hair and has a mole above the left eyebrow. This is mom. It's not a vase, it's an urn. - Julia, Julia. - Yes? We have a problem, see me in five minutes in the infirmary, okay? I'll be there. So what you need to do is tell her right away. - Say what to whom? - To Julia, that you like her. dad, there are 42 people in the world, and you like a person among them. I also like her, and so does Valeria, you see. So go and tell her, okay? Finish the exercises, alright? - Tell her. - I'm going. - Come on. - Julia, excuse me for a moment. Well, for one thing, I have to thank you for the lessons to Valeria. You don't have to thank me, I do it willingly, really. Will you join us for dinner, then? to speak to Valeria, for the lessons. Nothing intimate, familiar, rather. - It is also Ahinoa with her boyfriend. - Perfect, see you later. Yes! She said yes! You were great! You were fantastic. "There is no JFK." "Is anyone listening?" "We can not contact the control tower of Quebec. " "We've lost contact with Quebec." The last time I saw him was at 5. If he fell in the water two, five or ten minutes ago, how did he appear in front of the ship? It 's impossible. In my opinion nothing is impossible now. Put him on the table. One, two, three. What a disaster. - What could have happened? - I don't know, maybe a big wave. But how much the current was couldn't have distanced him so much from where he fell. What? Maybe it was us who turn back and we're sailing in a circle, Dad. Stay here, I'll go to the bridge, to check the routes of the last few hours. Also this is yours. Look, Vilma, I know that now we're not talking but you're being a monster hormone. I may be a monster hormone, but you're a whore. And you're a mind fuck. What the hell! I was going to get with Piti, Then you arrive with your belly, and now you think you're the queen? You were going to get with Piti only because Ramiro didn't want you, Estela. But what do you care, so in two days you will want to fuck even the priest! Pefect, I'll be with the priest, but you... will remain pregnant, alone and bitter, beautiful. Look, pretty. Stop it! Bitch! Stop it! - Bitch! Leave me, the fuck up! - Come here, waiting for you! Still! Still! - Let me, Piti! - Vilma. Enough! Enough, Vilma, enough, calm down. Okay? I'll never leave you, you know? Never! Never! I'll be the father of your child, you know? I'll stay with you forever, forever, Vilma. Eduardo Martinez, 19 years. The body has muscle stiffness and high epidermal maceration. Approximate time of death, 10:00. The lungs are filled with water to 90%, which... indicates that the cause of death... is asphyxiation by drowning. He was a boy. Just 11 hours ago I was taking care of the... bed. Relax. It's not your fault, Julia. Look at me. What do you do next? - Tell me. - The captain invited me to dinner. So are Ahinoa and her boyfriend. Why do you ask? Nothing. Kissing me in the afternoon doesn't mean that you can't  go to dinner with the captain in the evening, right? Are you jealous? Maybe so. Well, maybe you want to come with me to the dinner. It would mean that we are together, right? Yes. Then yes. Yes I want to. "Flight 4526 to Singapore." "We look forward to your answer." "Sydney is not there!  Can you hear me?" "There is no Sydney!" "The whole of Australia  is gone! Can you hear me?" Not drowned, look. They are signs of strangulation prior to death. What does this mean? Someone took him by the neck and threwn him overboard? Yes. - Fuck... - Yes. Sabotage. Someone put magnets under the compass. to make it unusable, so it's crazy. And another thing. That son of a bitch has blocked the rudder blade 15 degrees to starboard, So that we sailed in circles. - Also the sunrise was a sabotage. - How? He brought forward the clocks three-hours to have us believe that the sun rose later. - Holy shit. - Forgot that, it was in the laboratory. Who the fuck did this? The murderess of Martinez. He needed time to throw him overboard. First he tried to kill him in the hold. And appeared Burbuja. Gamboa. Well, now that we have all three, captain, and since this is your home, you will discover both now, because... I think it's the right thing to do. See... I have forty years, and your daughter has twenty. I understand the difference... But I wanted to ask you consent... For Ainhoa to come live with me. Long live the bride and groom. Sure, absolutely. I take a bottle of sparkling wine to celebrate, despite rationing, this deserves a toast. Dad. I know it's still early to live with him, and if you don't like it, really, we can talk about... - It's not a problem. - Ainhoa, listen. - Ahinoa, you said... - We can talk. the world has 42 people and one of them you like. What shouldn't make me happy? Only, seek a larger car... or a double bed, right? And you know what? If the dinner is fine... I could... ask for the doctor. It's no wait, no? No. - Hello. - Hello. Here she is, take the bottle to go. Wait, wait. - What is it? - You look great. Beautiful. Come on, go, move. Go Hello. - Julia. - Captain. How are you? - Hello, how are you? - Ahinoa. I hope that is not a problem, I... brought my boyfriend. Of course. - Captain. - Ulises. Ainhoa. Gamboa. It was enough to tell me that  you wanted to be with Piti, Vilma. I should have taken on the part. I would do it for a friend. But I don't want to be with Piti, Estela. That's not it. That's not it, it's that... the sun does not rise and the world goes mad... Fuck, I... I have the impression that everyone is rushing... looking for someone to cling to, not to be alone. I'm pregnant, you know. And for the first time in my life, I have a feeling that I can't handle it alone. I'm so sorry. I was scared. Relax. Look. It's for you. Thank you very much. Here. Listen... for me it would not be a problem if... my boyfriend was the father of your child. - Your boyfriend? - Yes. If you think you're cool going out with that guy. In the end he didn't do anything wrong. Come on, he will be the father of your child. Yeah, but it's not the same thing. So... In fact, we were thinking of... canceling the dinner. For... rationing and you know... Yeah, we were talking just now, I don't know if you... You shouldn't worry, Captain. From now on the rations to be distributed will be one less. Eduardo Martinez. When did you kill him? Before... or after you tampered with the ship? Eh, Gamboa? He was only 19 years old. You stabbed him in the hold, but Burbuja interrupted you. So you waited for dawn to throw him at sea, in the confusion. You laugh? - Yes. It makes you laugh? - Calm down, fuck. - It makes you laugh? - Calm down, shit, it's what he wants. - It makes you laugh that he's a dead guy? - He was with me. He was with me. He hasn't thrown anyone into the sea because we were together. - That's a lie. - No, not true. You were with me. You were in my bed. Giving me kisses and  making the dead cat... - But... - What the fuck? - Shut up and have a little respect. - Respect for whom? For you? - That bitch you call the doctor. - It was five minutes. Five! Until I realized what shit you are. Clearly. Since you've been rejected... you show up with her on your arm like a puppet and accuse me to get me out of the way. - You'll pay for killing him. - Stop it. - Son of a bitch. You killed him yourself. - Stop it. - Stop it. - Ulises. You put magnets under the compass. Leave me, Christ! You blocked the rudder to be able to get rid of him. Ulises, leave him or end up in the hold. - You put back the clocks. - No. - Then you came in the cabins... - For the sedative! I've stolen the sedative and put it in the soup. 25 mg per pot is sufficient. The magnets? The rudder locked? Was it you? And why the fuck did you do that? Because if the captain is not concerned with the ship, the ship rebels. A ship does not have a mayor, a captain. I just wanted to bring back the captain. But I did not hurt anyone. Captain, we found this note in the cabin of Martinez. captain, today I robbed my companions, because This situation brings out the worst in me. I can not stand to live adrift, knowing that we are destined to die. I'm sick, and I want to put an end to all this as soon as possible. I hope you understand my reasons. I'm sorry. Is it his handwriting? Burbuja. You're right. A ship needs its captain. For too long, we distrust each other. And that has to stop. Gamboa. I failed the oath I made at the beginning of this journey. I swore that I would have brought ashore... everyone. Now I can no longer do so. today, we give a final farewell to Eduardo Martinez. The first to fail among us... the survivors of the catastrophe. He will meet with all the others. Our brothers and sisters. Our parents. Our loved ones. For which we could not celebrate the funeral they deserve. But today... we tell them goodbye. Pay tribute to all those who have lost their lives in the catastrophe. Today we celebrate the funeral of humanity. In order to move forward. We begin again without them. But we do not forget. There is no evidence, but you saw the marks on his neck. That boy did not kill himself. I'm absolutely certain. officer Full speed ahead. Aye, my captain. "Flight 6254, with destination airport International Buenos Aires, off course. " "There is fuel for another twenty minutes of flight. " "- Can you hear me? - We have seen land. " "We see land about 15 miles north-west. Can anybody hear me? " "- There is still an island. - We see an island. " "There is still an island." "- It's about 3000 hectares. - Extension of approximate 3000 hectares." "- Oh, Lord. - We proceed with an emergency landing." "- Thank you, Lord. - 600 meters, a tail wind at 20 knots." "- We're going down, we're going down. - Thank God " "- We land! - Try for land, guys." There is land. - It's going under the ship. - It may be an error of the sonar. Or a beast the size of the ship. I have to tell you something. I like to kick Gamboa in the balls. You can choose whether to stay in the team of rabbits or in mine. - You are afraid to go and live with Gamboa. - I'm not afraid. - Hey. Hey, hey! - Come live with me. You don't give me a goodbye kiss? I can't, I can't. Is it possible that there  are species we don't know about? Piti. Not of this size without  having been sighted before. It will be a change, I know. - Piti! - With this we can kill the monster. If we want the center, - One of us must go there. - Ulises will dive in a cage? - But.. What are you doing? - Here there is everything. All information that the captain has hidden. Tell me the truth. Why must you go? I am the only member of the North Star able to do so. If this is a baby, God help us when we see the mother.
