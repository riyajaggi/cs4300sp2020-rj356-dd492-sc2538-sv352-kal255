 This is the western hemisphere  of the planet at this time. What does that mean? It's very likely that at this time, we are the only inhabitants of the world. In my ship I don't want secrets,  nor mysterious goods. What's in those boxes? I'll explain everything, but I need time. - Why are you in a box? - Because I came to know my father. I haven't the faintest idea how to be a father, alright? In the end you're not doing so bad. Well, don't take yourself too seriously. You are the first father I've had. Not even I like you.

 - No? - No. And who do you like? The Captain's Daughter can't accept a date with the villain of the ship? Going to a reception with the ambassador? More or less. I have a date. Who's the lucky guy? Gamboa. Or do you like Estela? What do you mean? I am loyal to Pilar to death. He's nice, a good person, He's ... perfect. I really like Estela. Do not ask me to pass up this opportunity.

 How romantic! They've made you a  declaration of love in morse code. "Estela, the best thing about this trip is you. " Who will it be? Have a date with Prince Charming? Didn't Ramiro tell you? I have a date with him. It's the the most important child in the world. And you have to take care of it. They are in danger both her and the fetus. We're not going to any hospital. In the name of God, I demand that we face land right now. Neither God, nor anyone else. Vilma needs us. We will demand that the captain face en route to a port. And if he refuses? Then he will have to deal with a mutiny. If we find the black box... we might know if America still exists. You still want to work on the Star? What we need is someone capable of making a dive at high risk. Captain, get cozy in the cabin and stay there. 46th 00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:49,082 You have no authority on this ship. The captain's me, you understand? - Get off me. -- Let him go. I'm sorry, captain, this ship is no longer yours. What's going on here? Don't let anyone take our ship. "Someone you read me?" "We can't contact any control tower for hours. " "The Azores are not there." "There is no land! There is no land!" "7-7-9-1" "New York is gone." "There is no JFK. There is no JFK." "We're losing altitude." "Two planes have just crashed in front of us. " "We're losing altitude." "We're gonna crash." "My God." Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET When people come together and close the door, They say they are doing things as adults. There was a failure in starting the particle accelerator. But I think in reality they do it because they have a secret. What they don't know is that a  secret can't be kept hidden. For example, if Dad is worried, he bites his nails. If Ahinoa likes a boy, she looks down. Mom said it's better to have no secrets. And leave the doors open, so nothing wrong can happen. It has a 99% liquid surface, therefore the land is still there. We don't know where or under what conditions, 76th 00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:31,260 if it's form of a continent, island or atoll, but we will find it. How do we find it? This is your plan? Navigate adrift in search of an island that we don't know if it exists in 500 million square kilometers of water? No. How long do you think we can last, Doctor? That's not the point. - At this time... - I don't think... The trip was to last two months. We have no resources. We will stay afloat until we die like rats in a trap, fuck. - Calm down, please. - No, no, no, that won't happen. Try to keep calm, everyone. Stay calm. -- Stay calm. - daddy, daddy. What are you doing here, honey? You can't stay here, love. It's a meeting for grown ups. It makes no sense. You must tell us what we will do because... - You can trust us. - Enough, enough, enough. Don't get hysterical, now. This ship has a desalination system. And I was playing the end of the world... What end of the world? Who told you about the end of the world, little one? I've heard it around, Daddy. Menu of fresh fish, the point and the head. When we reached the end of the world, my doll's head came off. And it scares me. - There is not enough food for everyone. - Even if we fish, no fruit or vegetables, everyone  will scurvy within two months. That happened to Columbus. From where do we get the energy? Because  the desalinator will take energy, right? We can eat algae, they are rich in vitamins and amino acids. As for energy, the North Star has solar panels. And there are generator shafts on the ship. - We must have hope. - Hope? We're your guinea pigs. When we embarked, you knew all about the experiment. And you knew that you would  leave behind a lot of corpses. What are "corpses"? It's late and you're tired. Time to sleep, okay? And tomorrow, at breakfast, I'll tell you the secret of the end of  the world and all that has happened. Do you promise? I promise you, my darling. And the doll, hang up her head with tape. Then you will see that it will  withstand another end of the world. Guys, back. Everyone back. Back, Piti, back, please. Gentlemen! I think you're forgetting one thing. We are alive. I am convinced that out there there are no other living people. So what we need to do is organize. Take inventory. Even the crates put in the hold, Doctor. From now on, your cabin will be your homes, your companions will be your family. Those who are happy to be alive, will stand by my side, and the others, seek a reason to get up every morning, because the 75 meters of this ship, are the only solid thing you walk on. Until we find this new land, mentioned by the doctor. Fine performance. I don't believe in anything. Wait, Ramiro. Come on, scatter. Come on. Everyone, get out of here. Come on, didn't you hear the captain? Everybody out. Are you okay? El Barco - 1x04 - A world under the sea - Traduzione e synch: Alle83, criz91, PanCeraRosa, nina_bach, johanna.p Revisione: Allison Case 29, audiovisual material for recording and playback. All right. The 30, this, dried seeds of vegetables and 100  pounds of fertile soil for outdoor use. Hell, those of the Ministry  were just committed. With all this, we can build a vegetable  garden and give us agriculture relentlessly. - The case, Damn. - Dad... Come on. captain, I wanted to thank you for defending me during the meeting. - If I can help... - Help? Tomorrow for breakfast I have to tell my daughter that everyone is dead, that she won't go back to school, that she won't have another doll, that there is no boy back  home on a motorbike. No father in his right mind would want a boy to accompany his daughter on a motorbike. Captain, Valeria will understand much better than the crew. For children everything is possible. Are we doing inventory  or a meeting of wives? - Give it back to me. - Not possible. Let's see, case 31. Technical material for  geo-location and basic survival. Okay? 32, tested infected strains. Where'd you plan to take the ministry? To bacteriological warfare, fuck? - I'm a vaccinations officer. - Of course. - And 32 is the latest. - No. Not at all. There is another. There is another case. Let's see. There, there. It can't be, 32 is  the last on the list. This will be the the Ministry surprise case for the lottery summer special. You have to open it, right? Captain. No, no, no. - I'm not allowed. - Well, what can happen, they send us to jail? Open it. How is it possible to sink the earth, Are you crasy? We are guinea pigs, Piti. As soon as I find a damn signal, I'll show you. Forget the signal, Ramiro. Look at me. There has been an accident. - Why would they lie to us? - This is a research grant, and a research grant, is observed and studied, and they are telling us these lies to observe and study us. Like lab rats. As they did in Germany, I saw it on TV! This is not Big Brother, - It's the end of the fucking world. - No, Piti. And you know how I know? Because I spoke with Pilar. The organization did not expect it, but I took the boat and I called her. And guess what? She didn't say anything about the arrival of an apocalypse. My girlfriend is out there and I know, and I'll stay with her until death. Until death, damn it. You find it or not? What is  it, for the love of god? I don't know. I don't  know, it's not here. For fuck's sake. Ricardo, we have to throw it overboard. - Relax, Julian. - Fuck that. This doesn't feel right. - Julian, Relax. - It has a countdown. - What if it's a bomb? - Don't be ridiculous, please. This is a science project. Only a retard would plan to put a bomb here. Oh yeah? Really? The same retard who operated the particle accelerator? What? Your friend, retarded? Because at the moment they will lynch. - Do you ... - Julian! Ulises, what do you think? Well, it doesn't feel right ... but there is no need to lose your head. There's not a charge ... or a detonator, or even  explosive liquid or plastic. The only thing we know about this case, is that it will explode in eleven hours. So there is still time. Captain, we have time. Captain. If it is in the load, it means that it's  important for the project. Very well. You have till eleven tomorrow morning to find out what it is, after which we throw it into the sea. Ricardo you can't deny the evidence, it's a bomb, damn it. And if the crew finds it, the mutiny before, will look like a  kindergarten party by comparison. The case is here, locked. I do not want to bring it  out or have it handled. So make photos or take notes, and find out what it is in your cabin. Ulises, you'll be glued to Julia overnight. Alright. Captain, do you trust me so little to assign me a guard? I don't trust the crew, doctor. I'm just trying to prevent a lynch. Look, don't worry, okay? Come on, photos, I have to close it fast. Yes, all right. I can't stop thinking about all the people I knew. We don't even know how it happened. If they suffered, if they realized... What a tragedy. My mother was terrified of the water. She continued to put  floaties on for eleven years. All of us have lost so many people, but we are here. Your father is right: it's a miracle that we are alive. Vilma, after bleeding, don't you think you should be a little concerned? - And not drink alcohol in your condition? - Palomares, the world has just disappeared. Don't get involved with my eggs. You call this a miracle? Surfing adrift without food or more? Vilma, you have a baby. You can not lose hope. God is giving you a second chance. Don't thank him on my behalf. I didn't ask. I'm not going to be Your Virgin Mary. Becoming a mother is not compatible with the end of the world. I'll see how she is. I've got, hope. The guy I like is here, and he also likes me. Should I feel guilty about that? Do you really think the world is over? I don't know. No, I guess not. - Or yes, what do I know? It 's very strange. - They make us believe something impossible! And where were you? I didn't see you at the meeting. I had plans. I kept this for a special occasion, but since we won't get  back to port for a while... Come on, drink. Can I tell you something? You promise not to tell anyone? I'm not sad. I didn't shed even a tear in the kitchen. I stood there whistling, as if it were an ordinary day. Well, it will also be a nonsense, but to me it looks like a normal day. Look, if it had sunk the Star, and I was on land, I would have suffered much more. In the end... for those two months a year I spent at an inn, you will understand... What I'm saying? That I celebrated here the last two Christmases, and I was also on leave. But I said to myself, "Where am I going?" And now look, here we are. Celebrating the new year. Well, of course yes, shit, if you have to look downcast to avoid being shot down. For once, you disgrace us, you laugh at the taste, fuck. Okay... so... Is it the same at first out there? - And you're still with your girlfriend. - For sure I told you, till death. All right. If you stay to  the death with Pilar, I'm to the death with my Estela. And I need to ask a small favor, with the history of Morse code there was interference, Ramiro, and now Estela thinks that it's you  who wants to be with her. Me? Why me? I don't know Ramiro, I do not know. But you have to explain everything. The experiment, guinea pigs, and Pilar. You explain everything, and then  leave her there, and I will come. Piti, Estela is a friend to me. What do you want me to do? Go out with  her to give her a two of spades? - that's really bad, man. - Yes, I know. I don't know, maybe if we do it quickly it'll hurts less. Go out with you and later me. Tick tock. Ten minutes for you, and ten for me. I just need to think of how. Inside it we were talking about... eating algae, when we finish the food. Algae! Don't mean to interrupt, but to me the greenery... is just shit. - Good evening. - What is it? Aren't you tired? Can I stay here and talk with you? You know what a particle accelerator is? Tomorrow I'll explain. I should  be in the cabin, come on. You can have the  conversation with the baby Jesus. Bye. Julian, but this is your cabin. CASE 33 Hey, if you want to go to sleep. I don't think anything bad will  happen to me in my cabin. Don't worry, Doctor. Besides, sleep is highly overrated. And being on call at night... I will miss you after a while. And on guard I will stay here, Alright! Good evening, doctor. I wanted to talk to you about something. Or are you already involved?  I mean, you're already occupied? No, no, no, I imagine, come in. Shit, what are you doing here? Problems with the bomb? No, forget the bomb, not that. Do you have a condom? - A what? - A condom, fuck. There is a little one Julian, by God! - Why do you need a condom now? - why you do you think I need one, Ricardo? I'm 43 years old. I went with Salome. I see mates and I care, doctor. You up here, in the sphere of the nobles. But at the bottom there is a smell of desperation. - You can touch it. - It's normal. They just lost their families. And you talk about diets based on algae, and continents destroyed and submerged. What they really need now, are dreams. And you know what  has always made me dream? Aside from being the scorer  of Iniesta, and everything. What I did dream of is being in love. Well, the ship is as big as a  football field, no, it is impossible, But maybe it turns out  to be a girlfriend starboard. Or a siren. Piti You know, my mother... always said that love is the best cure for everything. Everything. Here you are. You need to create the spark, butterflies in the stomach for boys. Piti, it's not something that can be forced. These things only happen with time. Ten minutes. That's all I ask. Ten minute dates. Obviously a lesson is mandatory. Look, enough. I don't force anyone to have dates. People now need to concentrate, to work, learn survival techniques, learn concepts of medicine. Not to play the dating game. - Maybe you're wrong, Doctor. - What? I believe that we will spend a lot of time on this ship. So perhaps the best antidote we have is to be a family. There are many people  out there that don't know. Tell me something. Wouldn't you like to know ... who to ask for advice? Or a favor? Or, if it happens, Who would like to kiss you? Fine. - All right, do it. - You are a great Doctor! - Very great. - Okay, Piti. Thank you very much. Thank you. He's right. I don't know. The way things are, What else can happen? Yes. Shit! It's all your fault.  Someone on this ship loves you very much, Doctor. What are you doing here? Ahinoa. I couldn't sleep. I know I should apologize for what  happened with your father, but... It's crazy, I can't get our failure to date out of my mind. Failure because you didn't come. Come on, Relax. Sure it's some idiot who exaggerated to make a joke. - I have to get the case. - No Julia, forget it. Forget about that fucking project. It's no longer good for anything now. Here there is no way to stop seeing you. And there is no way to  stop thinking about you... a girl with lipstick was waiting for me on deck. Very serious conversation? Ainhoa. If you don't want to see me, I can take it, But I need to know. I'll be waiting on deck. If you are not there... I won't bother you anymore. If you do come... well... we have our... second first date. Ainhoa. No. Ainhoa. Yes. Life is hard enough to go with feet of lead. Go. Look, tomorrow we take the case and throw it into the sea, with the current. don't think about it anymore, because we don't know what it is. It's enough. - I need to know what it is. - Really, Julia... I need to know that my work was for something good. Because I've spent 15 years on it. And millions of people have died. I need to know that it's not a bomb. Because if it is a bomb... - I will throw myself into the sea, Ulises. - Listen... It will be okay, all right. Relax. No, come on. Relax. Shit, now that things with  my father are going well... we screw it up. Thank you. That knocks me out. But What do you need  in my daughters backpack? Julian, here we are. Neither hidden, nor emergency, or anything. Listen, why don't you ask your son? -- My son? -- Yes. Do you think that I  would ask my son for a condom? Why don't you ask your daughter? - What? - What is it? - Girls use them too. - Get out of here. This is enough, Julian. Listen to me Julian. In the hold could be a bomb, and my five year old daughter I promised to explain tomorrow that the only child that  she will play with is Burbuja. So leave me alone and go away. Get out. Ricardo, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I lost my head, Okay? Really, everyone is mourning and I'm... I'm looking for a condom. I haven't had sex in twenty years, I don't understand it anymore. But it's obvious that it's late. I'm sorry. Thank you, go to bed. Julian. Tell me. That... I have so many worries... I realized just now that this  is the best news of the day. Damn. With Salome. Wow This is the best of the year. Of the century, Julian. Of the century. Finally some good news. Yes, but let's... never mind. - It will be for another day. - No Julian. Good things don't always happen. Let's go find a condom. Come on. Come on, Ricardo, no. - And then what? - Look Julian. If I have to turn the  ship inside out for a friend I will. All rise. Night inspection. Open your bags. And pull out everything you have in the drawers and cupboards. Immediately. Come on. No, not you, you can continue to sleep. Come on, go to sleep. For ten years I haven't spent more than... a month in the same place. Maybe in the end I get used to living on this ship. You put the lipstick on. Salome. Salome. Good night. Where are you going with that box? And you? With that mouth that seems rubbed with pumice stone? - Oh, God. - Come in. - Sorry, sorry. - Come in, relax. I'm done. Come in if you want, it doesn't matter. Come in if you want to,  come in. You can come in. I threw three empty cans. They only occupied space. - Thank you. - You're welcome. It was twenty years since  I slept two into a bed. The next time we combine two beds. You slept there on the wire, like a sparrow. A crush on the ship, and you will fall to the ground. Good morning. - I'll go. - All right. If you don't mind,  I'll close the door. I saw her while she was peeing, Ricardo. On my toilet, with her pants to the ankle. These things need trust. That is, to have sex there is trust but to pee in the morning, right? - Julian, by God! - So ... - Did you pee in front of Marisa? - Of course. Oh yeah? And when? On your wedding day? We spent a night together. One. Hell. She already threw the cans and bring her toothbrush. Do you think that's normal? She's doing such as seagulls, bringing the sticks to build a marriage nest. But seagulls that nest are married, she has a toothbrush. it's not an engagement ring. Well, no rings or toothbrushes... or pee in the morning in my toilet. Hell. I don't want a girlfriend. I don't want it. Fuck. Do you understand it or not? I am a nice treat for her. Because she is not alone. And she is... on the threshold of menopause. - I want to hook up. - Julian. Do you understand? There is Valeria. Waiting for me. And I don't know what to say. No more toothbrushes, see if Julia has news about the bomb. If not, throw it in the sea. Come on, hurry up. Good morning. You have a day of  intensive ten minute dates. Dr. Wilson and I have an agreement, we search for the couple of the year. Are you doing gymnastics? But didn't they tell  you to stay totally rested? I do what I want, Piti. May I know how you convinced Wilson to do this shit, you stupid freak? Vilma Listen, I understand that until recently it was fun to have sex, but today it's a moral obligation, because we have to repopulate the world. So it's better if we know  each other, don't you think? You are a pig and an idiot with a capital letter. Look, you're a storm of hormones. I understand that you can't think of Adam and Eve, But the one thing you say. Having a Kinder surprise  is not an excuse to miss. If the people are all like you, better to extinguish immediately. Get out of here, asshole. Attendance is mandatory. And I will mark absences. Listen honey... sometimes in life things happen  that are very difficult to explain. Like the storm the other day, it was a very strong storm. So strong that... it caused the land... to sink. Like when you pour the water? Yeah, well... Love, the fact is that now... Our home, school... and everything else, is gone. And where is Miss Maica, daddy? Honey, you... you know what a catastrophe is? Well, a catastrophe... is when... your doll broke her head. Because... How does it now think? How can it hear to? Besides without a head... we can not tell the story  of the end of the world. And how is that? Dad, you haven't told Valeria the spell? No. Heck. So... Therefore. A magician, has cast a spell over the world. And he converted everything in the water. the people into fish. Except us. Because when he was about to do it, Dad hid the ship in the storm. And the magician didn't see us. How do we break the spell daddy? Do We have to kiss the fish? No, honey, no. Kisses don't work with this spell. What works for this spell... is a magic word. Yes. And until we find it, we must continue to sail. Got it? Got it. Look, I fixed the doll. - Thank you. - You give me a kiss? And tickle? Stop it! - Okay. - Have you finished your breakfast? - Almost. - Almost, almost. Now what? Brush your teeth. Daddy, we must find the magic word. No, Burbuja, they are people. No. Ricardo... - The case is not there. - What do you mean? Someone picked the lock. They've stolen it. It was stolen out of this ship. One of the cases of the load that we keep in the hold, the case number 33, in wood, five feet. We don't know who committed the theft, or why, and nor if they got what they wanted, but it contains a very delicate material... that could be valuable for the safety of the vessel, for the safety of everyone. We need to find it as soon as possible. The land will be submerged, but here there continues to be rules and I will not allow... this boat to turn into an uproar. If anyone knows anything, please raise your hand immediately. No one has anything to say? No one, right? Very well. When the clock strikes eleven, we will meet again. I hope that by then someone has an answer. We're done. You're too good, Ricardo. They steal a bomb and you're limited to a warning. - What would you like me to do? a raid? - No. Not a raid. You don't need a raid to know who took the bomb, damn it. Can't you see who is missing the meeting? - Doctor... - Excuse me, Doctor. The conversation dates still valid? Just to... I don't know, to relax the environment, because I think there is a bit of tension. - Well... - Could I have one with you, Miss Julia? No. No, no, no, honey. And... you shall be the judge. What do you think? Gamboa, fuck, the same one who organizing the mutiny. Who else would want to steal it? Who? One thing, preferably  them to him by a thrashing, or lose control of the situation. And this time it is not just a gun. Come on. - I need another half an hour. - I'm on your side, okay? Ulises. Ulises. The case my father is looking for is the one you carried last night in the hall, right? - You have to tell me now. - No, I will not. Why not? Let's say I have my reasons. Thanks to your reasons they are punishing the innocent. They're going to Gamboa. So, if you say so, I'll do it. Stop. Hey, what happened to manners? I could be naked. And you sure you're  making the right choice? Because I think you're wrong, so I'll give you the  opportunity to stop being a snitch. - Where is it? - A person or animal? Apparently you collect pigs. The case you've taken.  Where did you put it? What's in the box? - What should be in the box? - There is nothing. Tell us where it is  or I tear you apart. The events begin in ten minutes. So if you want, I'll wait with a watch ready. And maybe I'll tell you. First of all, you must know that they  probably are recording this conversation. I have good news. The world has not disappeared; it's a sociological experiment.  Think about it. If the world had disappeared, do  you think we would do these meetings? A Coke, please. Ramiro, I don't know why you say that. We heard the plane recording. There's nothing out there. Come on now! Something that I can do with a microphone and a plastic bag. Your family is alive, as well as mine. And Pilar. It's all alright. And I'm in love with her, Estela... not you. - You don't have a date either? - I don't want to know anybody. Maybe in twenty years I back the urge. Change couples. I'm sorry. No one loses his opportunity. Come on, cheer up. - How did it go? - Well. - Really? - Just go Hello, Lovely. Hello, Piti. Did you... like the romantic  declaration in morse code? I made you want to take off your panties, right? - Well, it was my idea. - Was it you? And this dating thing. you sure it's a theft, Captain? A distraction, maybe. Try to concentrate and think of what was the last thing I did. I ask you one last time. - Where's the case? - This is already the sixth last time. What do you want me to do? Give him a couple of slaps? Yes, and with an open hand. The clock  is ticking, Ricardo. This shit is mocking you. Where's the case? - Julian. - Let me do it. You are more tender than a piece of bread. Because of you this here is sacrificed and we will all jump in the air, including your daughters. Dad! - It wasn't him. - What? Who did it? Ainhoa, Ainhoa, who was it? Answer me! Who did it? - Who? - Ulises, okay? Ulises has the case. I need to know what it is...  and I need to know that it's not a bomb.  Because if it is a bomb ...  I will throw myself into the sea, Ulises.  I am... a sensitive guy. I won't deny that there are days in which I am an idiot, but I adapt to everything, Estela, boat trips, naps on deck, whatever you want. As you can see... there aren't many alternatives. Well, I mean that sooner or later everyone will form pairs, they talk of repopulation... or even love. Piti... you want to sleep with me? You did all this for me and... perhaps it's not crossing the ocean over the phone  to tell me that you love me, but... it's still a start, right? Time's up! Gather your emotions and each sheep pair changes. Come on! Another opportunity to love! Beautiful, change or you will be disqualified. These are the rules. what rules, Burbuja? If I invented this. Yes, but I'm the referee. So either change or I pull out the red card and I throw you out. Look, there is a lonely girl. Move. Come back in ten minutes  and give me an answer. Come on, move, move, move! Hail Maria Pure. I'm kidding! Shit, shit, shit. Ulises. - Come with us, hurry. - I am ashamed to be your father. I didn't do anything. You are always the same both of you. - Always the same. - Come on. Holy... - Sit down. - What is it? - I said sit down! Sit down! - I can't now. Sit down. Damn it... Come on, what is it? Relax, it will take only five minutes. That's not my father. And if it is, he lost his head completely. Listen. It 's my fault. I put a gun to his head and I organized a mutiny. - Believe me, I wouldn't trust me either. - Yes, but he is the captain of the ship... and thus he can not judge people. What do you want to do? Turn this ship into Auschwitz, or what? Look. It's clear that your father and I started on the wrong foot... and it seems like things will never change. So it's better if...  we stop seeing each other. No... - It wouldn't be right. - None of this is right, But I will not make or break you with your father. I don't care about problems, because this is my life. You are someone who prefers to blame a child instead of defending it, but you already knew that. Last night, maybe it was the wine, we talked a little... and I have come to think that... after working together for 15 years on this ship, I still didn't know you well and that perhaps we had something in common. But no. You and I have nothing in common, and you know why? Because I care for people on the ship, rather you didn't care about anyone, because you're heartless. You have a pole that gives a jolt to all those who approach. You are a fool, from head to toe. I am not your girlfriend, nor are a seagull in menopause. Look, you've spared three. Get out. Get out, go away. We are trapped on this ship and won't be like waiting in the square on Sunday to not be seen with your father. Then I'll have to wait in the door to a cell. And we see as well. And you'll make my lips look like a pumice stone. Because I'm not going to stop seeing you. I don't know why you did it, Ulises, but it's not right, man. Fifteen minutes is torturing a man, and now it's up to me. One of the two times she was wrong, Captain. It was unfair. Ulises, look, this is not a game. You know what would make an explosion in the hull of the ship? I am almost scalding for a bomb that is only in your head. It's in your head, Dad. I can't. I can't. - Holy God, he's my son. - Your son stole the case. And if we evacuate the ship? There are still three quarters of an hour. - In ten minutes we put everyone into boats. - And then? After three days adrift, everybody dies, Julian. The only chance we have to survive is this ship. I need to know what it is.  I need to know that it's not a bomb.  Well, our time is up. You wanted to talk, but we didn't even have much to say, so... These five seconds you gift them, okay? Swingers! Last chance for love! It's been a pleasure. I want an abortion, Piti. Swingers. Up Piti, we're swapping. - You can get another. - Burbuja, leave. pull out the red card if you want. This date is no  longer valid, know this. Go away, Burbuja, come on. - Yes, yes, but I am saying... - Get out! My life on earth was not the best. My parents didn't knew me, I didn't know the father of my child... But there were parks, Christmas trees, There were other children... I don't know if I would have wanted a child on earth, but I certainly don't want him here. Why not here, Vilma? What is there not to like? Piti, because we will be here... until eventually the food is gone, until eventually the milk is gone. People will start to get sick and die. And I will not let my son live like this. No Vilma, listen to me, damn it. This is an experiment, They are studying us, but I am sure that the earth is still out there. So why didn't they bring me to the hospital, Piti? Do you really think they would have left me to bleed... for an experiment? Ramiro is easier to believe. That Pilar is still there waiting for him. And for you that Estela... will fall into your arms after five minutes of talking. But I'm not one who fools himself, Piti. And having this child would be a mistake. No, wait, Vilma. Now it's my turn. Ulises, for heaven's sake, confess. - Ulises. - Ulises. Wake the fuck up. We're losing him, Ricardo. - We're losing. - Julian. - What? - No! - Look at him. - What are you doing captain? Leave him. - He has the case. - I have it. I asked him to bring it to me, I had to take it apart. I cut the cable and The countdown has accelerated. - How much is there? - Five minutes. Or four. It's in my cabin. Julian, get the case, let's go. When I was 10, My brother died in an accident. My father tried to go on... but my mother stopped talking. Remained all day in bed. At home we had to walk on tiptoe, you couldn't shout, or listen to music. When I was 15 My father left home. My life will not improve because yours was worse. My life was shit, Vilma. Shit. With parks, natives, cinema and Champions League. And you know why? Because my parents never lifted  a finger to make me happy. The world is sunk? Who cares! Because things may not fit in this boat? Why? Look, Vilma, this child, won't run out of things he has never known. It's you, who will show him the bright side of things. It's you, and only you, Vilma. Only you. Come on! Get it from that side, run, run. Come on. Let's get it out. - Don't fucking push. - Come on, go ahead. - Come on, get it of floor. - On, on, on. - Run, Julian. - Put it on the ground. That's it, come on. - Julian leaves. - Come on. -- Leave, Julian! - What? Forget it, Julian. We will not make it in time. Daddy. Are you crying? No, honey, no. We were carrying this heavy chest and... that stupid uncle Julian crushed my foot. But he won't hurt me anymore. Come, stay here with me. I found the magic word to this story. It's about a girl who had become curly. The spell would be broken if you repeat three times: Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom, if you hold me, do not sting. Shall we? Sure. Give me your hand, darling. Julian. If you don't close your  eyes, it won't work. Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom, if you hold me, do not sting. Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom, if you hold me, do not sting. Honey, it worked, You can open your eyes. Our favorite song, Pilar. You told me that everything was possible, and here I am. It 's all a farce, I'll see you on earth, love. Thank you. It's been a long day. When it seems that things can not get worse, something always happens that reminds us that we are not so bad. Captain... the device, I think I know what it is. It's a kind of transmitter, an emitter signal over long distances. NASA used them for broadcasting space. It's used to send a signal indicating our position. It's sending a signal? To whom? I don't know. Who are you, Julia? I don't know if it's Julia that cuts the fillet of my daughter, or the one that steals, mind, and allows you to be tortured by two men to get what she wants. Which is it? There is a flock of birds that is directed towards us. They are above us, desperate, hungry and aggressive. Palomares! A cook is telling me how to talk to my crew? You currently have a relationship? These questions are written by hand. Get off me! If you take, I take too, would you like to kill yourself, Vilma? They accuse me of being insensitive, lacking in affection, - Asocial... - Antisocial, unwilling to integrate... Nobody is perfect. - I'm here. - If they go, we're dead. Tightly close all portholes, fast. Did you hear? Come on. I know it sounds crazy, but it's the only chance we have. We shoot these birds. Ready? God help us all.
