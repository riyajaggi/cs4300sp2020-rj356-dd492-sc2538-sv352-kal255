 My mama said that when you want something... You have to say so... because other people are not mind readers. But sometimes you don't have the courage to say things... because you're ashamed... or you are afraid that someone would get angry. - Shit! - Shit! She's beautiful. Without protein, without vitamins, without land... she remains the most beautiful woman in the world. Even though she treats me bad...

 even though I can't tell her... "Hello, I like your hair... did you sleep well today? ". I have not slept a wink. I spent all night thinking of what I can't tell you, and daydreaming... that is the only way I can be with you. If you wanted to come with me, I would jump straight into the sea, on a raft made with three poles. To get out of this ship would be madness... but it's crazy to stay so as well. I love you... and I will not stop, for all those harpoons you shoot me. I am in love with you...

 that is why I want to whisper in your ear... I hate you. Dad always says that adults will complicate life. And that sometimes they say one thing... when in reality they mean another. Snitch... pretending to meet by chance with a mop is old stuff, you have to think of something else if you want me to kiss you. I wouldn't kiss you even dead. Not even in my worst nightmare. And you have to have already had a few, because you have dark circles that will get to the foot. At least I have dark circles and not balls. You seem to weigh a lot from sitting all day scratching yourself. I guess I'm not the only one who spends all day sitting scratching, because you're putting on a big ass as a parade ground. Yes I hate you. You're the worst thing in the ship. What? How do we proceed? I had my abdomen sewed like a rag doll... and I have no idea if we  will ever find that lost land... we are trying... but don't you think that today the sea... has a different smell? Nothing better than dancing interestingly tight... because the sea changes odor, no? But what happened to that dance? - Nothing. - Really? She told me that... it was a magical moment. Yes, sir! Then we must take a walk  with a magic wand, right? Don't be rude, Julian. Well, I'm going to give the order to hoist the topsails. We must take advantage of this tailwind. - It will be like windsurfing. - Ricardo, let it go windsurfing. We go or not to talk to Wilson? And for what? For what? The magic moment, fuck. This here, after Ulises... she does not want to know more kids. I'll tell you. And here you come in. Heck, a mature man... offering a serious relationship, something else entirely. - Give me the binoculars. - What is it? Carlos, brakes. We stop. Queen America. What is it doing there? El Barco 2x03 - The Last Queen of balsa Am?rica - Translation and synch: Saropula, PanCeraRosa, ziomele, johanna.p, Amandamap, miahu Revision: Allison Queen America. It is certainly an ocean liner... why are they all called like that, Queen something. It has been a shipwreck for sure. Corn. Ham. Salami. I can't believe it, it's a miracle! We won the lottery, Ricardo, the lottery of the sea. We won the biggest prize. Look, Captain. Certainly they are other things to eat... or gasoline... or paper to wipe your ass. They are more crates, Captain. There are dozens. Finally something to celebrate on the Star. Burbuja, alert the sailors. I want them all prepared for sailing maneuvers. - We will approach to bring them on board. - At your orders. I'll tell you one thing. I think in addition to the cases... Julia wants to celebrate something, right? I mean... after that interestingly close dance. I'll tell you, Ricardo, even for her... the sea has a different smell. You should have thrown yourself,  fuck, and kissed her. - Julian, enough. - But it's true. If you go by Wilson and she says, "come", you dropped everything. Drop everything, Ricardo. What is it? Morning. I agree with my father, Captain. I love Julia and I want the best for her. And I don't know what happened in the dance, but she has a smile... that goes from ear to ear. Of course you two are nosy... If I were you I would not waste time. Women like that fly, Captain. You know what you're doing now? The dinner invitations. With this, a couple of candles... a romantic dinner. And after the second glass, tac! - Take the kiss. - It goes like this. Obvious. And anybody saying that they are not clean and tidy. This one we put here. Here, let me do it. Come on, since you closed your hand in that door... you don't have the nimble fingers. - Palomares. - What is it? Nothing. Thank you. They arrived. - Look... - Stop it. No, really, I don't give a damn for what you want me to see Piti. - I do not want to talk to him. - Alright, Vilma. We are already inside, okay? Piti, I don't want surprises. Neither gifts. Do not keep pissing me off, okay? That's okay. I won't be a pain in the ass. Neither gifts nor surprises for you, Vilma. But for the child yes I can. Yes I can for the child. Alright. Wow! What a beauty. Damn, but it is beautiful. - Thank you. - It was nothing. Even if I bump against your armor, and slide on the oil... the baby will sleep very well. Well, just fine... - It seems a bit harsh, no? - Estela, honey, you for certain things... You can also put... a pillow, something soft. It's so beautiful. And those? But well, the best shaven. I can not believe it. Wait, let's see. Right now, This is a collection of incunabula. Whos are they? They are Ulises. The boy came with little luggage but... but he brought some indispensable weight. This is why he has those arms. If I were in your place... I wouldn't get very comfortable there. You know, those sheets... Captain. We are pulling out the latest crates. In all, we found sixteen. All from the Queen America. Very good. I know it's a tragedy to find the remains of a shipwreck... but I can't help but be happy. - It's food. - Then we have dinner together? Of course we will. Of course we will. We must celebrate in full regalia. - I'll tell you more, I will wear heels. - Superb. - The appearance at eight in my cabin. - Alright. We have dinner early and... then we'll see. Alright. What? They keep you on bread and water? - What is it, little pig? - You need a wrist band? Are you tired, huh? Mister Putip?! - Done partying, right? - Did you have a good night? I see you relaxed, no? What a piper... What? Good, no? Come on, take it. I told you that there was a reason to those muscles on his arms. What do you mean? Ulises. It's my fault. What is this? Well, a while ago... while I was giving the cradle to Vilma, she started to look for a pillow. And in a pillow... okay, I found these. I found them. And, of course, I had to... say they were your own. What do I do, Ulises? Are you crazy, Piti? This one, no. Do not do this. If the magazines are yours, they are yours and you say it. This is bullshit. Come on, bullshit... Bullshit for you. Fuck. since I met Vilma I do the wrong thing always. I gamble the paternity of the baby to strip poker. I try with Estela, with Julia... Yes, don't ask me anything. Now, you've seen. With Vilma it's not affected as a plush toy. No, it's true love. As those five-star, fuck. And we know that the filthy magazines and love are not compatible. They are not compatible, Ulises. - I'll keep your magazines. - Really? - Keep them, Keep them. - But if you do not take them back within three weeks, I keep them. Thank you very much. And those? What are those boxes? Attention, guys. A moment. Good. Today is the first day, since we started the trip, in which everything that happens is cause for celebration. We found sixteen crates adrift. Full of food. And a can of fuel. Well, that's something. Therefore, I want to celebrate all that. Tonight a gala dinner. Wine, salad, croquettes, cold cuts, meat and naturally... the fantastic potato tortilla of Salome. And everything you want. Everything, everything you could want. On the house. A list, and I will prepare everything you want. - We think in the kitchen. - Come on. What a surprise, Burbuja! I thought I'd never cook a tortilla. That you like so much. However, that the cases have appeared in a line... - It's strange. - Even with the weirdness? Well, the sea should have... spread the cases randomly in a much wider range. I don't know what you mean, my darling. I don't understand. I'm sorry. When did that ship sink? I don't know. I just know that I'll cook. And I'm happy. - Hello blackberry. - Hello. - Would you do me a favor? - Whatever you want. - Can you wash the cod? - Okay. - Then can you put it in the freezer? - Yes. Two days without eating fish. I thought that I would grow scales. - Hey, you have to give up with the menu. - What is it? Ricardo has invited Wilson to dinner. Finally. Well, to that Ricardo will have to measure up to the previous boyfriend. Measure up? At what height? What do you think, that just because Ulises was twenty years younger, the rest of us are hopeless? No, no. I don't mean for age. Than what? For resistance. It seems that the shepherd... sounds his flute well. They found an arsenal of porn magazines. Fifty. And I wonder, where the guy has taken this tendency? What do I know. Will it be genetic? - Salome, enough. - You play your flute or not? I don't play anything. Damn. Why should I play me? Neither the pipe nor the harpsichord, nor the trumpet, or anything. Damn. I am over forty years. Are you joking? Do I have the face of a maniac, or what? Captain, Captain, there are people. There was a larger point, on the radar. It's a... a survivors boat. Fuck. - Where are you going? - Come on, I don't believe you... What about you? Where are you going with those? This is not the time. - Damn! Paloma San Basilio! - Shut up. It 's my private collection, okay? I had a discussion with Salome. - Because of you. - Because of me? Yes. You have become the ship's first officers wanker. - Here we go. - No, she's asking if it is genetic. And if I play the flute. - She must not see me as a scumbag. - But this stuff is of the 80s dad. Dad, it's almost tender. - Makes tenderness. - Tenderness a horn. - I want you to keep it. - Who? - Yes, You keep it. - I keep nothing. What will change? By now they know that you have an arsenal. - Put them in your bag, well, that's all. - No, no. It's the arsenal... listen, Dad... Please, son, come on. Fuck. Restrain. I will not address these issues. How will they be, Captain? Maybe they are a family, like us. But if they are not, they will be very sad. And will they have a pet? A small dog? Will they know what a particle accelerator is? Captain. Stops the maneuver. Those people have a face full of blisters and wounds. They may be sick. Well, we have the medicine. We can not take them on board as so. Full astern. Stop the movement. Attention everyone, no man go out on deck, I repeat, no man go out on deck. - What's going on? Why have we stopped? - I don't know. We can not get out. Out of the way. What the fuck, Ricardo. Where did those people come from? Why can't we retrieve them? They are sick. Ricardo Montero speaks to you. The captain of the North Star. We will be launching a rope. Please tie it to your boat so that the current... does not pull you away from our ship. Burbuja, go out and use the rope to hand them a walkie. I want to talk to them. Okay. Ulises... I don't know if you have just arrived or are going, But wash your hands, please... No, no, no... It's soap, I've just poured it. Only that crap faucet doesn't work and... It must be understood... when I said you spend all day scratching yourself... I had no idea that you did it as a sport. Really, I didn't. - Well Ainhoa, I told you that it is soap. - Of course. I had just poured it, just... And this stuff is not mine. It is not mine. It's someone elses. Then I tried to open that devil of a faucet, and it didn't work. - It doesn't matter. - No, no no. It does matter, Ainhoa. In short, I'm telling you the faucet I opened a minute ago and it did not work... - It is not my fault. - Yeah. - This is soap. I swear. - You don't have to explain. - Enough joking. Enough. - I didn't say anything. Knock it off. They found people out there. We were traveling on an ocean liner, The Queen America. We have sailed from the port of Valencia, but we met a huge blizzard. And we got lost. Then... then a cyclone... a cyclone sank our ship. It was a nightmare, Captain. It was a nightmare, we are the only survivors. We have seen die... hundreds of people. It was horrible and now we are without water, food... anything. Thank you. Thank you for your help. It's a miracle. Thanks, really. Captain... ask them about their wounds and blisters. Listen... we will help you. However I need to know if it is possible that you are sick. Sick? Captain... there is one sick on board. She has very high fever on various days. At first it was only a headache, but... but... now she doesn't respond,  she does nothing more than rave. We have been at sea for several days. Captain... listen to me. If we do not does come on board... If you do not let us come on board we will die. Here comes the captain. The reason why we did not have the survivors come on board... is because at least one of them is sick. This is why we will drag them back to the ocean... As if they were animals? Why don't we bring them up and treat them in the infirmary? We don't know what disease it is, whether we can help... or if it is something contagious such as to endanger the entire crew. Captain, in practice you are willing to let those people die 20 meters from the ship. Listen, listen. Those people are sick. They might have anthrax, chicken pox, meningococcemia, hemorrhagic fever... almost all are deadly diseases. It's also only transmitted using the same bathroom. With the medicines that are on board... we could not cope with 50 varicelle... in fact we could not cope even at 50 contemporary cases of the flu. We would all die. When I had resurfaced, after a week adrift... you had no hesitation to pull me on board. Are you a doctor, by any chance? Captain. What are your orders? Wait twelve hours. Along with water and food we will give them antibiotics. If tomorrow morning the fever has passed... we will have them come on board. And if not? If it doesn't pass do you plan  to abandon them on that boat? Like the plague? Captain, I demand that you make them get on board. You do not demand anything from anyone. The captain is me. And I'm protecting your survival. They, too, are survivors, captain, just like us. You're going to let them die, but you have no problem eating their food. Listen to me... I'm not going to endorse dinner. If any of you have a conscience, you should do the same thing. An ocean liner is a very large ship. It may be more than two hundred meters long... have three hundred sailors... and if it is a cruise ship, more than four passengers. And the fact that the survivors are only four... it's strange. Strange, strange, strange... Now begin again with the old story of the strange. And paint after a day at sea  crumbles. Whereas these crates... look just painted. Burbuja, acrylic paint does not crumble. - It crumbles. - No, it can withstand a thousand shipwrecks. Enough with paint, Burbuja. Bring the crate to the hold, you give only annoyance in the kitchen. - Come on. - But it is strange. - What about you? - Me? What? You do not want to go to dinner with Ricardo dressed like that? Julian told me that you have a date. And I don't know whether I will go, eventually. I don't know, I'm not in the mood for dating today. Any excuse to stay in overalls and with a ponytail, right? Come on Salome, do you realize what's going on? Of course I realize that. But I believe that happiness alone can keep this ship afloat. Yeah. And the captain is delighted to dine with you. And I think you are also, a little. Besides you still have to eat, right? Well, now I've shortened it too much. Dad, forget it. With the jitters you're going to make other holes in the beard. - Come on, be relaxed. - How can I stay relaxed, my daughter. - It 's just a dinner. - I haven't dated in twenty years... and at age 40, the disappointments are not as raking in 20 years. If it goes wrong... Why should it go wrong? If you want to play it safe just follow... the three basic rules of a perfect date. Let's hear it, what are these three rules? First, as soon as she arrives... do not just give her two kisses but  embrace her with strength... as well exceeding the barrier of space. Second, help her sit ... because the initiative goes well, but she must see that you are a true gentleman. Okay? Third and more importantly... whether she caresses her hair... or touches an ear... or smiles at you... then... - Plunge forward. Plunge forward and just. Yes. - But how can I throw myself... - Plunge forward, yes. - But no, you say, but it... it is my cabin, not a disco. - There is a table, as I jump? - Dad, Dad, Dad... I'm just saying pay attention to all the signals and act. Okay? Because yes, a dance embracing is fine, candles also are good... however, they are good for the Middle Ages, because... for a journey... Dad... for a journey at the end of the world, we want emotions much stronger. And the beard looks great on you. Very good. Yes. You look very handsome. - May I? - Come in. How are you doing, man? Are you preparing the attack of the cobra? I brought you a little present... last minute. What are you doing with that thing, by God, Julian? It's a first date, come on. The first what? Whether it's the first or the last... you go on a date with proper precautions. For everything. Tell you what. Listen, right now... of these in the world there will  be five or six. And that's it. Take it. But I don't want it, damn it. Keep it. Come on, Take it and keep it. Save it and go. I'm going to look for a shirt. You know what? Ainhoa and the midshipmen thought I was a wanker... so now you tell everyone that this arsenal is yours. Come on, Ulises, what is this stuff? These are Playmen. Where did you get them? The National Library of the ship? I'm not in the mood, Piti. Now go tell everyone, all over the ship, one by one, that these magazines are yours. Ulises, you promised me. Is this for Ainhoa? Ulises. Don't be ashamed because of Ainhoa. If a story is dead and buried, there is no future. What do you know? You do nothing but insult eachother. If you love a person, you take care of them... not insult them. Ah, yes? In my opinion, I don't know. People who love each other do not even deceive themselves. You deceived Vilma since you knew her. What about this? You are one who collects porn. These magazines are yours, not mine. Do you know why you don't have the courage to tell the truth? Because you are first to be  ashamed of yourself, Piti. How you doing, Piti? - What is this? - Huh? It's uh... - Paloma San Basilio, no? - Yeah. And all this stuff? Come on, take it to my cabin. It's all confiscated. Come on. Piti... Why don't you read a book, huh? What are you doing? Nothing, that is... I pulled this cable by mistake and tried to install the printer. It's not a printer. It's a transmitter. It serves to output a signal. So if there are other ships in the world they can find us, but there are no other ships in the world. Wow, Burbuja, I did not think you knew so many things. And what else do you know? What else do I know? I also know that the paint falls apart in the water. For more if it stays a week in the water. And these crates are perfect. And I also know that the survivors said they departed from Valencia, but it is impossible. And why is it impossible? Because of the ships there were none that was an ocean liner. They left nine merchant ships, four deep-water, six sailing ships, seven container ships and three ferries. None were an ocean liner. And how do you remember all this? Because I like big ships. And picture-taking. - You have taken pictures before we set sail? - Always. How nice! I also love the ships. - Really? - Do you have any pictures? Yes, a lot. Why don't you show me? Sure, come on! Just follow the three basic rules of   a perfect date.  As soon as she arrives, do not just give her two kisses but embrace her with strength.  Come in. The pin is pricking me. - Oh, oh! - Sorry, sorry, sorry. Well, there is no blood. At least the chest is intact. Please, Captain! It's beautiful! Thank you. Could you get used to dancing and  romantic dinners by candlelight? help her to sit...  - You have to at least try, right? A single night of dancing with you... - Is not enough. - She has to see that you are a true gentleman.  - Please. - Yes. For a journey at the end of the world,   we want emotions much stronger.  - They're not mine, huh! - No. I've just confiscated them from the boys to prevent them from turning on the ship, more than anything else. Especially for Valeria. Captain... Paloma San Basilio. I don't think they are the boys, because in 1984... they were barely born. I don't know what to say honestly. Okay, yes, they are mine. When I was single. I wanted to throw them into the sea. Look, not that I think about it,  I'll throw them right now. - No, no! - Yes, yes... - They weigh a lot. - They don't weigh a lot. Doctor. What are you doing here? How embarrassing, she saw you eavesdropping. I was passing by, and I wanted to hear how it was going. What? Is the doctor a little loose? She is upset, if anything. Come on, take these. For Salome to wrap the fish, or throw them into the sea, as you please. Ricardo... - Paloma San Basilio. - This does not beat anyone. - Enjoy. - Thank you. More meatballs! Well, so no dinner nobody enjoys it. What's going on, you are not hungry or what? What about you? You give me a cradle and then don't even wait for me to eat? What are you doing? Nothing... I was fixing the mattress covers... it was not pulled tight. And you? What are you doing here? But you were hiding magazines under the mattress. No. Yes. Piti... I don't care about the magazines. Look, it is not wrong to just have fun. I do it too. Not with magazines, but... Everybody knows that for a long time you have been isolated on this ship. You should not feel guilty for being satisfied alone. I too have satisfied myself every now and then. What do you think, that women do not sound... the bell. How do you call it? The... Wait, wait, don't tell me. I like all kinds of music. Not everything has to be an orchestra in life, no! The small button to open the gate, right? No, no, no... Who says it's wrong to devote himself to a solo by flute sideways? The switch, the switch of desire? All instruments are fine. How to mix the plates of a turntable, you know? And much more fun than listening  to an orchestra in a country... with five musicians out of tune. Vilma... the first day I saw you I thought you were a freak, but you are the most incredible girl on this ship. And I'm an idiot. What is he doing? Oh my God, he is crazy! - It's very good. - Thank you. If she fondles her hair...   or touches an ear...  Plunge forward. Plunge forward.  Julia... Yes? Do you still want some wine? Okay. Look, Julia. I am not like this. Well, I mean I'm not one to have special dates. I'm a very clumsy man. But that dance... was the best and most intimate that happened to me in a long time. I know that what I'm about to say... maybe you will not follow, but... I fell in love with you, Julia. No, don't say anything. I know I'm not your type, I'm not stupid, but what I feel has come suddenly, like the floating crates. So I thought it was a sign, to tell it like it is, and how I feel. Captain, please. Is this also the boys? Captain. Captain, we need you on the bridge. - What's going on? - We have an emergency. Let's see, this one is a tanker of Vigo A year later sank in the Gulf of Mexico. Look, this is an ocean liner more than 350 meters in length. Almost as big as the one who lost the survivors out there, maybe. Poor things, no? You don't feel sorry for those survivors? Of course I feel sorry for them. I too have been shipwrecked, you know? When I had... the accident. And you don't remember  anything before the accident? Well, once I remembered that I had a girlfriend. Marimar. But then I no longer wanted to remember anything else. Because I'm fine. I'm happy. And I have friends. Who love me. Even before you had friends, Roberto. Do you remember when this photo was taken? You... and I... we were... we were friends? Yes. But one day... you took something that belonged to me. A red folder. Remember? I... I... I don't... I don't remember. It's the blood clot... so... big that... I can not think. Bye, Roberto. Bye. He just called us. Captain, do you read me? Palomares? I reached the boat, Captain. What is he doing? Palomares, I order you to  return immediately to the Star! I'm sorry, Captain... but, this time, I can not obey. I am a priest... not a sailor. I will not be part of a crew  that leaves human beings so. So if you leave them here... you will have to also leave me with them. Look at what was in the crates, drifting. Just as well, because it was about to finish. But, knowing your... bad habit, I'm not surprised it ended so soon. Look, the sheets wash cycle  along with the mandala, it needs a good wash. Why don't you disappear and go count toilet paper somewhere else? Well, because alone you might clog the drain pipe. And we just need... one arrogant fool who is going in and breaking things. You, however, should wash your mouth out with bleach. What is it, you get the urge to treat me so? Listen... the only desire I have with you is to vomit. So, well, stay away from me. No, forget it. What do you want me to say? That you are such a bitch,  but you try tastfully? That I vent with porn, since you come here, to excite me, but then you do nothing? Or that you're a whore who has lost interest, as soon as I left Julia? Can I say that? Do you like how I insult, Ainhoa? Why must we treat eachother like this? This pact makes me sick. You know what I think? That you like to keep me hanging  and gasping like a fish. It's true. It's true. Well, I'm not playing this shity game anymore. If you love someone, you don't treat them badly. I prefer not to talk to you, rather than having to insult you. What a beauty! Who is the captain? I am. Captain, we're not sick. I put the suit on to demonstrate to you that we are in good faith, I only ask... to take me to get an examination, to verify this for you. These are normal wounds... from the shipwreck. And also burns caused by the sun, but... the girl who was ill has improved, she just took... medicine. And the rest of us do not... we do not have symptoms. Of any kind. Captain... this... this ship is the only hope we have. Julia, Julia, Julia! Back! - Do not take another step! - For the love of God, Julia! Where did you get this weapon? Lower it, please. Get off this ship and go back to the lifeboat. You will have to shoot  me to get me down from here. Because I will not let you abandon my companions. - I said to lower it! - No! You will bring this woman to the infirmary, and we will test her. I told you. We don't know what they have. Maybe it's nothing, but if not... maybe, we could treat them. Back, everyone out! - Did you hear? Get out! Get out! - Even you, out! Get out! Get out of here! We are not sick. Why are you doing this? Why? So what? How was it? - What? - Well, if you used the last condom. I told her how I felt. Yeah? And? And that we are not just two adoni... that is, all these years on a ship... has made us two being obstructed, in love. I also... really, we do not know how to do it. Zero. Why, what did you do? It's that it won't satisfy. It will not listen... It stays limp, fuck, I have to explain everything! And where is the problem? Well, the problem... is that I want to get up out of bed, and were to go stand on the railing of the bow, with wobbly legs! Instead, she starts playing the harp. Ah, Julian! In love we are like Laurel and Hardy. And maybe we are rusty. Yeah, if you say so. We will learn ... you'll see! We will. Because we can fall in love. Things will start to go well... you'll see. She has a fever, and is dehydrated. The sores on the skin could indicate a... Julia, the crew is paralyzed, there are four people confined on a boat, "could" does not exist! - Captain... it could be any - I need... I need to... - Infectious disease. It 's impossible... - Julia, can you tell me for sure... if she is sick? When I get the results, I will know. And how long will it take for the analysis? I don't know... no less than four hours. It's midnight. At four o'clock we will make a decision. Maybe you're the asshole on the ship... or, perhaps, the most honest... maybe Ulises and the captain deserve a lesson... and Julia a divine punishment for destroying the world. But leave Burbuja alone. I thought you understood not to be more of a problem, Ramiro. And I will not be. I'm with you again, but I will not let you hurt Burbuja. It's not his fault. You're wrong. Burbuja is more to blame for everything that has happened... than anyone else on this ship. - Are you okay? - Yes, yes... Piti... Piti! Hey! - Piti! - We gotta get him to the infirmary. - Piti, come on, come on! - The survivors have plagued us! My God, the ship is infected! Do not touch him! But... but, fuck, help me! "The steps of love" Often... a gentle massage to the temples, or just a whisper in the ear, has much more sexual charge... than sexual activity itself. Shit, it's true. Hello! How's the new girl? - And this girl? How is she? - What? - Julian, please... - How are you? - Julian, really... good. - How is this girl? - Yes... - You seem a little tense... - You know... - What? The Pied Piper of Hamelin is... beautiful. But... I believe that tonight... here we will sound the Vienna Philharmonic. I'm warning you... there will be an encore... a double... and a triple. You're a beast. Put on your masks! Deal one to Vilma. He's hot! Put him sitting here! Get out of here. It can be an epidemic. Piti has touched the woman. When he picked her up, the suit was torn. Maybe they have already infected everyone. It's an epidemic, we will all die. - Do you feel sick? - No. Good, go to your cabin, change your clothes, throw them away and do not come out of there. - I am sending backup soon, Doctor. - Okay. Piti, come, come here. No! Damn! For a day that we have dinner the way God intended, damn it! Fuck! Close the door. - Did anyone see you? - No. What's happening, Ainhoa? The problem is that I can not tell you. Ulises, please. Please. Julia, two students have collapsed, others will not stop throwing up... and they all have nausea and more than 39 of fever. Are you okay? Tell them not to come out of the locker room. It is very important to prevent the spread of the disease. Go into the locker room right now. You can not insult the girl you love and be happy, right? Go into the locker room and do not leave from there. Attention! In the locker room! I love you! Did you hear me? I love you! Ramiro, accompany them in the locker room and do not let them out. - Come on, come on! Let's go. Relax. - It makes me very sick. And I could climb the mast to let everyone know, also the last person on the face of the earth, shout until I no longer have a voice. - But I can't. - Why? - What's going on? Is it Gamboa? - No, no. - Is Gamboa threatening you? - No, no, Ulises, no. Please, conditions were these. You were not supposed to ask me questions, you had to have patience, give me time, but it's been a couple of days and already we have not kept the agreements. And I know it is not easy, I know, I swear to you I know, I swear. But this is what I ask. I can't offer anything more. I can't, I swear. Listen to me... I don't know what we're trying to do... but I can't hate you, nor can I insult every time I see you... because I can't. And I want to tell you that I love you every morning, every second. And I will not give up until I can be with you. At the risk of dying because I can't sleep, because you won't tell me, because I don't understand. I will love you how you ask me to. I will not make requests. Julian, are you okay, honey? Are you throwing up? Julian, love. - Let me in, my love. - Coming. I open. (stutters nonsense) Stop talking nonsense and let me in. Open! - Julian, please. - I'll be alright. Coming. And this... What's this? "The Steps Of Love"? If I have to study hard so you don't play the harp anymore... I will, or I'll do anything else. Play the harp? What are you saying? I can't do it, Salome. It's too much for me. I'm even worse... I start to shake, why not, why not... - Love, my love! - If I am not able to satisfy you... call a sailor, he will finish  it and get it over with. My love, a sailor? What do you mean, love? Come here, look at me. Look at me, my love. When I see you walk through that door I do not understand anything, I can not breathe. I don't want to be with anyone. I just want to be with you. I love only you. Again? Julian, please. Julian, my love! Captain, I said that no one was to leave the locker room. There is a row of students outside the the infirmary. I can not do anything as long as I'm not sure what it is. We must immediately activate the security protocol. A moment of attention! We were struck by an epidemic. To prevent the infection from spreading, students who do not have symptoms, are to be directed straight to the club. Again, all those who are fine, go upstairs. Captain, what's happening? The virus is spreading on the ship, Palomares. It's was a mistake to put the woman on board. What virus? We are all fine. I have been on the boat for five hours and no one feels any symptoms. The girl with a fever, already speaks and feels better. All the healthy ones are in the club, captain. There are eleven. In the end you were right. These people will destroy the North Star like a biblical plague. - What do you want? - I need to talk to her. - Julia, do you copy? - Do not talk to her. No one speak to her until I find out what happened. They are the captain's orders. You do it sniffing the captain, so you can do what you want, right? This is not your mission on the ship, Julia. Your own was not to fall in love with Ainhoa, yet it happened. Sometimes when a big wave arrives, it is better to let go. If you fight it, you're going to drown. Take care of all these people  before you lose control. You know very well that the survivors  have nothing to do with this. Julia, do you read me? All students who wore the red cap are fine. You know what this means? Julia? I realized what the crew has, Captain. Salmonella. Food poisoning caused by eggs that they have eaten. The students with this hat did not eat dinner, that is why they are not poisoned. We have enough medicine on board to be able to control the virus. There is no longer any reason for not picking up those people, Okay? This is the captain speaking. You simply have food poisoning. So go to the infirmary, and Dr. Wilson will administer medicines. And the members of the Queen America... welcome aboard the North Star. Thank you, Captain. We owe you our lives. Thank you. - I'm Victor. - Tom. - Dulce. - Leonor. Welcome to the North Star. The day on which we sank, amazing things began to happen. there is something that is making the nest on the ship, but we don't know what it is. Yesterday, during dinner, the captain has told me how he felt. Salome, I think I love him. Don't tell me now that things are start to go well with Julia... you like the new one? Do you remember what we had to  do when the first bud bloomed? Now we have to start being a normal couple. Prepare a nice penance, because I will sin from every pore. Ricardo! Ricar... If you are looking for trouble, Ulises, keep it up, and maybe you'll get lucky. An invasion of mosquitoes is coming down on the North Star. The sting can be deadly. It makes me very ill, Julia. There is something wrong with it. Here they are. Who were you talking to? - She's dead. - No, please, no! Forgive me. I have a message for you, from your wife.
