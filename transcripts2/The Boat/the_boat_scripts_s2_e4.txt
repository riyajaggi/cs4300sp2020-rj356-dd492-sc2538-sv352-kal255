 - What do you think? For the new. - Beautiful. Salome, Burbuja. They're flooding the bathrooms. With the new you had to give a tour, so they could sit down and do the manual labor. - And this mattress? - It's the girls. They gave them the new cabin. The ladies will stay with you. - We'll be a little close, no? - Why are you complaining, Ramiro? Wow, finally mixed cabins. Eventually we stew so much meat! Come on! Give a hand, I don't think you have to complain about that. This is the bridge crew... We had to teach them everything,in respect of new.

 - That's the infirmary... - Where to hang your jacket, where was the canteen, and where were the bathrooms, when they had to pee... or else! That sucks! The crap will eventually cover us! But really, where are these hairs? Thats not hair, Salo. Hairs have... the root and are not... - So thick. - Throw it away. Throw it away. We try to unclog the siphons, there shall not be any of this. - Welcome. - Thank you. Before the start of the lesson, the new had to go to the blackboard and say their name. - Hello. - Hello. So we knew them and, slowly, they began to smile. Hello. Well, I'm Victor. Tom. Dulce. Leonor. The ship had lurched so much that it was going to sink. The people clung to everything. At the second crash, water had entered... water had entered with violence from all sides. From all sides. The halls of the atrium were flooded in a few seconds. Hundreds of people were sucked in through the windows. And the sea swallowed people. They were all hysterical. There were mothers who called... children, desperate... so, as soon as we could, we boarded a lifeboat. And there it was even worse because... we could see... a lot of people shouting, calling for help. From the sea... sticking hands that clung to... the lifeboat... the edges, but there was no more space. There was no more space. So... we were forced to remove them... hitting them with paddles. Then, suddenly, nothing. Nothing, an absolute silence. We had to abandon them to their fate, it was like... as if we had killed them. They stayed there. And the others? Those who were in the boat with you? We were in the winds on the lifeboat. Five died of their wounds after a few days. The other eleven, a few days ago. and things kept happening... a typhoon toppled the boat, and it took so long to flip it over, that... They were all tired and died of the cold, so... we saw them... go to the bottom in front of... of us. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Well, your nightmare is over. This ship is your new home. And we are all your family. Welcome to the North Star. Thank you. Well, now life goes on. And, if I'm not mistaken, a lesson in survival in five minutes. - Come on. - Captain, I'm sorry. Excuse me, but first... we would like to speak with our families to... tell them that we're fine. Can we use a phone? El Barco 2x04 - Las tripas de Bobby el Oso - I know many of you... think that these lessons of survival are absurd. But I hope... that the story of our new friends will have changed your mind. Because it happened to them, but tomorrow it could happen to us... - How is it? - ...getting lost on a lifeboat. Stem of two centimeters, five leaves the size of a fingernail, and the most beautiful green I've ever seen. You have to keep dry. Especially the feet, why? Do you remember what we would have done when the first bud was born? The crew must be assigned one... So... now we have to do what all the normal couples do. I would write a text message every day to tell you how beautiful you are. I would come and take You to school on a motorbike... THE BELLY OF THE BOBBY BEAR and I'd take you to the movies. We would not be able to reach agreement on the movie to see. - Try to stay dry. - I do not give a damn about the movie. Because I would kiss you since they turn the lights off until the end credits, Ainhoa. It's if you keep... part of your body covered. I asked you to have patience, Ulises. Ainhoa... - You're not interested in today's lesson? - Yes, of course I'm interested, yes. Who were you talking to? Didn't you hear me? I asked who you were talking to. Who were you talking to? Hello? I was talking to my sister, okay? With my sister. Excuse me. The lesson is over. You can go. I said that the lesson is over. Go, please. That's it. - Hi, how are you? - Hi, how are you? - Good. - Thank you very much, Doctor. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. How are they? A little malnourished and dehydrated... but until I have the results of the analysis of blood and urine, I can not make any diagnosis. It will take a couple of hours. Okay, tell me when you will have the results. And... - I wish you a good day. - You too. You feel okay? Relax. Sit down. That's it. This will do you good, it is chamomile. I just learned that the earth is gone. - You don't have something stronger? - Of course. - Here. - Thank you. Perhaps it won't be a comfort, but... the land is gone, but not all of it. We know that an island has remained. We heard it from the recording of a black box. A plane has spotted it. Perhaps we will get to meet it in years, but... there is hope. Vilma, I'm just saying that our relationship is a bit strange... indeed, almost absurd, I think. - Absurd? - Yes, absurd, Vilma. But why? Because we take a bath together, naked, without touching, then I promise to be a father of your child without having contributed with a bit of... seed. Now we are going to live in the same cabin without a first date, Vilma. Yes, it is absurd, absurd! Look, Piti, I came to live with you and with five other people. This is not a big step. It is a gypsy camp. But if you really want to... we can make things right. What are you thinking exactly? A quickie to say goodbye to your bed? No. No, I thought to ask the captain for a cabin... for the two of us and our cradle. Listen to me. Look, I'll jump if you jump too, but I don't want any pressure, or tension. Really! Think it over. And in twenty-four hours, give me an answer. Okay? Okay. May we listen to the recording? Captain, we are desperate. After all we've been through and you told us... This would be good news. Listen live that there is land... that it still exists. In the recording you hear while dozens of planes are crashing. I don't think it's good for getting them up. - Yes, but... - Listen to me, seriously. It's the best thing to do. Yeah. Right. I would not want to pry, but... Why were you dressed as a bride? At the time of the shipwreck, I was getting married. The ship sank a few minutes after saying "yes, I do." - Wow! - No. I'm sorry. I waited nine years for him to asked me to marry him... Nine. And... I waited nine years for a couple of minutes of marriage. Captain... I need to tell you something. No. - It's nothing. - Come on, tell me. No, it's silly. - Leonor, listen to me. I just told you. - No, it's nothing. This is a family. And in a family a problem is a problem of all. Tell me what it is. - Hey! - Hello! - It's all yours. - Thank you. - How you doing, Dulce? - Good. So... nothing, everything is clean. I take away this and you can make yourself comfortable. I'll give you some advice, before I forget. If you choose this bed here, the first thing you see when you wake up... is the sea. Fantastic! You're leaving already? Don't leave me alone, please. Look, Dulce... maybe what I'm about to tell you will feel like a shit... but it will pass. The news of the end of the world, it will pass. You'll see. I'm all alone. I have no one. Don't say that, you're not alone... I am here. In addition to the other forty crew members. In seventy-five meters in length you can not feel alone. It 's like being on a bus during rush hour, you'll see. Knowing that we are all in the same boat, it helps. As if we were a big family, you know? It helps a lot. Hold me up, please. Please sleep with me tonight. Please, I don't want sleep alone. Please! Okay, I will sleep with you. - Hey! - How are you, Tom? - What is it? - No, I was taking my things. The cabin is all for you. - See you, guys! - See you later! - But what is this crap? - Dirt, nothing but dirt. Dirt? Of what? Where is it from? From the siphon, from the faucet, from the tubes exhaust from behind the cabinets... From many things. It happens when you clean to a blue moon. If we use more of the broom, we would not be invaded by this crap. Get that dirt off the table, Burbuja. It's not dirt. - They are nymphs. - What? there is something that is making a nest on the ship, but we don't know what it is. - God! - Look! It moved. Enough of this nonsense. I'm going to take the ammonia. Burbuja, do me a favor throw away that crap, at light speed. Come on! See... God! I never believed in these things. I never thought that... See... the day when we sank, is when unbelievable things began to happen. Since that day I have seen giant fish, seaweed mutants, fog so thick that it seems like granite, and all the cutlery stuck to the ceiling of the ship. It's obvious that unbelievable things, are no longer such. Yes. Tell me what worries you. I have a message for you... from your wife. My wife died two months before we were to embark. I know. Captain, although it may seem absurd, she asked me to tell you something. "The Postman Neruda" "Ainhoa... if we could erase the past, start from scratch, and change the rules that prevent me from being near you, even if it were possible, I could not love you more than I love you. " "This morning I realized... that the only thing I want is to be with you, to protect you and take care of you. I'm going crazy because I can not do that. And even though now it seems impossible... If you think that there is even a chance for us leave me a message in this book." YES, PLEASE... Let's try it! Hey, Julia! - How are you? - Good. How are you? Good. As you are elegant. You have a date? No. No? - Why? - Because you look beautiful. Salome, the captain yesterday declared himself during dinner. And what happened? Nothing. What do you mean nothing? No, I didn't know what to say. Salome, I had never looked at Ricardo that way. I don't know, I spent the night thinking and thinking again. And what were you thinking? Well, I thought that Ricardo has always been there... and this gives me security. When I am afraid, he calms me down... and I realized... I'd like to know him better, spend more time with him, have breakfast with him, laugh with him... Salome, I think I love him. So what? You think it's too late to... give him an answer? No, honey. If Ricardo told you that he is in love with you, he is. It has been twenty years with Marisa and I never saw doubt... even for a moment, so, please, go and tell him so. - Julia. - Julia. I feel very ill, Julia. Something is wrong. Come on. Come on, come on. Captain. Captain, I'm sorry, I did not tell you. Captain, please do not ignore me. Captain. Captain, I'm sorry. I'm sorry to have caused you so much pain, I didn't want to. Please, I prefer you to believe me crazy. You appear on a boat adrift, You boarded the ship, and the first thing you tell me is that you have a message from my wife who is dead. Why should I believe you crazy? I understand. I understand. I'm sorry, Captain. Please, listen to me. Just a minute, listen to me, please. Please. I was not thinking. I've said it... I said it impulsively, because... when... I touched the funeral urn... I saw her. I saw her only a moment, in a room. How was the room? With a double bed, white walls and... and blue curtains. White with blue curtains? Yes. Couldn't you think of anything better? How many rooms were there as so in the world? How many? Piti. What's up with you? I need you to bind me tight to the mast... and not untie me for twenty-four hours. Let's hear... what happened? I have been trying with the pleasures of the flesh. The top model, from the lifeboat... we tried... she says she wants sleep with me. - And? - And? We know, Piti. Come on, since when is it a problem for you? Well, this morning when Vilma... Look, maybe you're not the person most suitable to talk about it, but... Vilma said she wants us to live together. - Congratulations. - Well congratulations a little, huh? She gave me twenty-four hours to think about it and... tac! Two minutes later, strafiga comes out of the new world... and hugs me... and was clinging to me! You know what I want to tell you? To go to bed with Dulce, so you screw it up with Vilma, forever. But Vilma has chosen you, Piti, that shows that you deserve it. This is your proof. Poof of what? Yes, the proof. The proof is that if you pass twenty-four hours... and have not done anything, then it is a sign that there is a new Piti. Hello, Piti. - Hello. - Hello. Do you know where I can... find a pillow? Yes, in the laundry room. Thank you. A romance novel? You surprise me, Gamboa. I wonder if it is true that even the greatest sons of bitches have a heart. If you are looking for trouble, Ulises, continue this, maybe you will find it. What do you want, an apology? Or is it that you're getting old? Do not push me, Ulises... it is better for you. Done. The movement you've felt may be a contraction, due to the fact that your body is changing. I was bleeding, Julia. But how, she was bleeding? You know what we do? You stay here and rest, and relax, the fetus is fine. Excuse me... Doctor, but I think there is something on the ultrasound that maybe you haven't seen. Well, Julia is the doctor of the ship. I am a gynecologist. Pardon me. Relax, Vilma. See this thing here? It's the cervix. The problem is that it had expanded too soon, so you have to strengthen your cervix for cervical incompetence. There is nothing to show for it. Yeah, but perhaps, when we have evidence it will be too late. - I will run to warn Piti. - No. No, Palomares, please. Not a word to Piti, I do not want him to feel under pressure. It is important, really. Okay. So, Vilma, now you have to take deep breaths. Okay? Try to relax. Take deep breaths. Let me see. Very good. Good. Done. Good. We must act, and it is a delicate operation, But you have two doctors all for you. This is crazy, we do not have the means or even an operating room. You have a scalpel and a suture needle, right? It's enough. captain, we must act. The fetus is well, the heart rate is normal. The only thing we have to do is wait and see what happens. Good, we will do so. Leonor, I already told you, Julia is the doctor of the ship and I trust her. Don't turn away from Vilma for even a minute, and alert me for any news. I am at your disposal, doctor. If... the beats of the fetus decrease, call me urgently. - Julia. - Yeah? Leonor If she is right, what chance would I have of losing it? You have no reason to worry. Relax. Ainhoa. I can't find Salome, nor Julia... and I can't eat the shrimp. Can you peel it for me? Okay. Well... let's see, the head first. My girls are already here. How are you? - Can I have one? - No. I have not peeled them, and this one is for Valeria. Enjoy your meal. Thank you. Then you remove the legs... Ainhoa, honey... have you talked to Leonor? No. Are you sure? Yes. Do not tell me now that you began to make progress with Julia, you begin to like a new one? Daddy... I like Julia, the new one no, I do not like the new one. Valeria, do not say that, because we don't know her and... and then she just discovered everything that has happened. She must be very scared, right? And you have to give her an opportunity, like everyone. Ainhoa is right, Valeria. Look, if you finish dinner early, I'll let you go play with Burbuja, okay? Come on. Is it good? You take away the legs... Never ends this shit, man! What you got there, Burbuja? It's... a mosquito. It's what was nesting in the Nymphs. Nymphs? And it's strange, because the mosquitoes... do not come from... - Nymphs. - Yeah. Maybe it's a new species, because I can not find it, and in the encyclopedia there are all insects. But how did you get this thing, honey? It pinched me before I killed it... and it is not a normal puncture. It's why I want to know what species it is. Maybe it was in the crates... Do not scratch my darling, don't scratch yourself. Stay here, I'll try something to heal you, okay? - Okay. - Do not scratch, love. It's red, red, red. It's red. Where are you going? Is there something wrong? I'm going to the cabin. I lost my appetite. Now you will have dinner... smile... and you stay. With everyone. Not with that wimp that you hugged in the cabin. Is that clear? How was it? The white room with blue curtains. How was it? - Captain, leave it alone. - Please. - Forget what I said. - I asked you to tell me what you saw. Please. Beyond the blue curtains, there was a garden. Very beautiful. And... an armchair upholstered in blue. There was a globe... antique. There was... a book on a table. "THE LIGHT OF THE SOUTH". With a bookmark inside... purple. There was an inscription, with a childish hand... It said... Daddy... I love you. Do not scratch, honey. Do not scratch, love. Bollocks. The fever is growing. I have been stung by a lot of mosquitoes. But I never got a fever. - It's all right, honey. It's nothing. - And it was only one point. And it was a baby. If the mother stings you... this is it! That's what it looks like. It's reddish and has a big head, like if it wore a helmet. - From here. - Give me. The mosquito Anopheles darlingi, discovery in 1973 in the forests of Bolivia... is a vector of malaria and dengue, in lethal form... given that the venom of its mucous serotypes of the virus multiplies. Come on, give it to me. Salome. Tell me. Take the little one to sleep with you, I'm staying with Burbuja. Okay. - Good night Burbuja. Do not scratch. - I do not scratch. Look, it's the heartbeat of your baby. Hello! It is fast, no? Yes, between 120 and 160 beats per minute. Almost twice as much as an adult. It is a bit uneven, but it is normal. Don't worry. So... you're too pretty to be on guard. Yes. Did you have plans? No, nothing that can't wait. And you? Why don't you want me to tell Piti? Dulce, are you there? Because Piti has... one great force of will. - If you want to put it that way. Yeah. - Yes. Messing up... he is transport, you are wrong. Vilma, trust me. I will not do anything but sleep. Piti the stoic, the eunuch. Call me so. I gave him twenty-four hours to decide if he wants to come and live with me. - I understand. - And I don't want pity... to make the wrong decision. Maybe if I pretend to sleep... the night will pass smoothly. So you expect to receive a response? Well... there is someone waiting for mine. Really? Who is it? It is said the sin... Listen, I'll tell you one thing... if they are the men of our lives, they will wait. Just like that. Come in. Captain, you sent for me? Yes, come in, please. My God... Come on, Piti stoic. Temperance, Piti, temperance. Piti... fortunately. Thank you. Thank you for coming. - I wanted to... I just wanted to... - Fuck, no... temperance, temperance. I don't know how to tell you. It is essential that what I tell you does not leave this room. Maybe if I think about bad things... Shit, she approaches, she approaches. Bad things, bad things. Fat, lots of fat. - The dynamic duo. - Things... are not always as they seem. - An old woman naked. An old woman naked. - I know you... Don't believe it, don't think you know me so much. And one more thing... that happens to so many girls. They think they know me and... in reality I am not as an open book as I may seem. One second. I'm just going to the bathroom and back. You told me you have a message from my wife. What is it? The message had neither head nor tail, captain. - Forget it. - What did she say? Please, please. What did she say? Look inside Bobby. Just this. Nothing more. Look inside Bobby. It's the favorite teddy bear of Valeria. Her first gift. FOR RICARDO "Ainhoa, I'm so happy that you think we can try again. I need to see you to talk. At dawn. - When the ship is empty and no one... - And no one can see us. I'll wait inside the classroom. I love you. " - Palomares, Palomares. - Piti. What is it? - Palomares, Palomares. Look at me. - What happened? What is it? Make me a penance as it should be because I will sin like never before, father. And what are you gonna do with Vilma? To Vilma I think to say yes, I want to be with her forever. But tomorrow, Father. Tomorrow. Because tonight I'm in limbo. Look. I still have 12 hours and 26 minutes for no sin to hurt anyone. You're a piece of shit, Piti. You do not deserve Vilma. Or to take care from you, not that you are looking out for her. Why? What happened? Is there something I don't know? No. Nothing. Forget it. Father, I swear that from tomorrow I'll be a new man. I swear. But tonight... I do the last performance tonight, fuck. The last performance and I go out with applause. Towards a new life, a new Piti. "Ricardo... when you read this, I will not be by your side. It hurts so much having to be separated from you, that since yesterday I have not stopped crying. But I want to ask you to look ahead. Now it is up to you to face the first guy for Ainhoa... and doing homework with Valeria. I'm not afraid. I know that you'll do fine. I ask only one thing... fight for happiness with nails and teeth and love as you have loved me. I am so proud of you. I love you. Marisa." It means something to you, right? It means everything. I am... asked to be happy. Dulce. I am afraid that Dulce has fallen asleep. The poor thing... the poor thing was exhausted. Come tomorrow, if you like, you can continue talking. Sure, sure. Tomorrow or the next day. It's not that it was a conversation of great importance. - Small Talk from survivors. Bye, guys. - See you tomorrow, Piti. Officer... officer. Officer... officer. What is it? Are you okay? It says here that a mosquito can lay more than 40,000 eggs. Sure. Come on, I'll give you another antipyretic. Today we have gathered... more than 90 nests. If each mosquito.... can have more than 40,000 little children... - there are more than 3 million mosquitoes. - Yes, yes, yes. Take this, come on. It says that the eggs will hatch in less than 24 hours. Thank goodness that we have cleaned the whole ship, if not we would be eaten alive. Roberto. Yes. You know I usually don't say certain things, but... - Listen to me, Roberto. - Yes, I'm listening. You know that I love you like a son, right? I know that. Me as a child, you as a father, and Salome as a a mother. Right, right. It says here that only 12 nests... can birth more than half a million mosquitoes. Yes. Nasty. Hello. What are you doing here? We had a date, right? Page 75 of the book. I guess you're here for that. Ricardo. Ric... What is it, Julia? Captain, Vilma feels sick. The beats of the fetus have dropped to less than 140. If we do not do something, she will lose it. She was right. We must operate. Wait a minute, I'll go down with you. I'll go change. - What is it? - I don't know. Ricardo. What is it, Julian? There is an infestation. A fucking Amazonian invasion of mosquitoes. They are all over the ventilation circuit. It takes five bites... to kill you. What? Look. I'm sorry. Look at the swelling. And it continues to expand. It gave me one and my fever continues to rise. Although he is taking antipyretics. You have to cut and clean up the pus. And, of course, disinfect the ship, right? - What the fuck do I disinfect the ship with? - With vinegar. They're here. Come on, come on. Everyone inside the cabins. In the cabins! - Quick. - Do not leave. Come on. Listen carefully please. An infestation of mosquitoes... is spreading on the Star. It's not bullshit. They are dangerous. Their sting can be deadly. I want you all sealed in the cabins, understand? Plug the ventilation ducts. and the cracks in the doors that are not watertight. Understand? And let no one leave. I repeat. Nobody leaves until further notice. I've got another one for Salo. One for the father, one for the mother and one for... for the son. Sure, you come too. Come on, come on. And Vilma? Where is Vilma? Palomares, Vilma is missing, you know where she is? - Relax, Piti, Vilma's fine. - And you know this how? How do you know, how do you know? Tell me where the fuck is Vilma, Palomares. She's in the infirmary. - There are problems with the baby. - What? I don't know what more you want. And I am exhausted. Why send me these notes? Because I love you. Captain, open up, it's me, Piti. Please, captain, I have to stay with Vilma. - Open it, Captain, please. - I'm going. - How are you? How are you? - Good. Vilma, breathe. She's fine. Quiet, please. Breathe. Dulce, honey. Relax. Look at me. Dulce, look at me. Tell us the truth. - Nothing will happen. - I didn't say anything. Really. - What did you say to that kid? - I didn't say anything. Did you tell him what we are here for? - Have you told him about us? - I didn't say anything, I swear. So, with this anesthesia you will not feel pain, However, you will feel the scalpel and my hands. Vilma, it's very important that when I tell you not to move, you do not move an inch. Agree? You have your cervix dilated too much. And you can not contract the abdomen, otherwise... surely we will lose the baby. Oh my God, I don't know if I can do this. Think about something else, Vilma. Here, think of something else, think of me. Of us, Vilma. Because I don't need to expire twenty-four hours you have given me. Forever. With you and the baby, Vilma. Think of us. Relax, Vilma. They are here. Come on, Salo. You know that we have confidence in you, right? That's why we brought you with us, remember? But you have put our mission at risk. And we can not allow that. Because they mean to stay here forever. And you do not want that to happen. Don't you? You want to go home. Don't you? Come on. I don't know. Victor. I'm so scared. I don't want to be afraid. Can I stay here? With them? Please. Ready? Ready. Let's go get them. - Breathe. - 62. One milligram of atropine. Hurry. Please... honey, sweat towels. Breathe. Well, so, pull my hair back. Thank you. 59. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. No! No! Please, no! The door! - Dulce! - Give me that. Breathe, Dulce. Beautiful... You'll be fine, you'll see. Breathe, look at me, beautiful... Relax, well, breathe. Where is Ainhoa, Palomares? I don't know. I know I have made many mistakes. But... I love you. Who did that? Who beat you up? Was it Ulises, or who? It doesn't matter who it was, aren't you listening to me? I'm telling you... I love you. Ainhoa! Easy, easy. Relax, honey. You've never loved anyone in your life, damn it! You threatened my father, Ulises and my little sister. This is not love, this is being sick. You are sick. You do not know what it means to love. Fuck, no. She's dead. No! Vilma, now you manipulate the cervix. Okay? Now you can not move even an inch, okay? Here, we have now. There we go. Relax. 52. Ainhoa! Ainhoa! You're right. I don't know how to love. I forgot how. I spent too much time... surrounded by weapons... hate... Violence... I behaved like a dog with you. I know I've caused you pain. But it is also true that... it was a long time that... nobody gave me a chance... to be loved by me. I know that I deserve... that you do not even look at me. And I'm not asking to get back together. I just want to... convince you that I... I can change. It's the opportunity I need. Please. Forgive me. I'm sorry. What name have you chosen for the baby? Because, you know it's a girl, right? Do you know that within a month she will be able to hear you? - Ah, yes? - Yes. 48 pulsations. Hang in there. Hang in there. - Are you the father? - Yeah, I'm the father. Come on, come on, please. 64. Is going up. Very well. You are a champ, Vilma. You will have a beautiful baby girl. And safe. Scissors. Captain. It is clear now that it no longer matters, but... yesterday, when you said those things... I didn't know how to react. This morning I would have liked to answer... but there was no need. You have already chosen. It's me, Gamboa. Come in. You wanted to see me? The information you gathered on the captain has been very useful to me. We have it in hand. Have you recovered the black box? No. What a pity, isn't it? I have not recovered it. You. A few days ago you could have obtained it without any problems. But clearly... you did not know the importance of that box. Now everything is more complicated. You've allowed them to tamper with that transmitter. You have not taken the black box. The beating the other night was merely a warning. Another mistake... and you'll need a little more than a couple of bandages. We understand each other, don't we? - If these guys were armed... - Why should they be armed? To me you seem to be the same bitch I met in Geneva five years ago. We have not found those people, we went to look for them. - Yes. - Tell me. We have not yet found the black box. She was talking on the phone. She's a liar. Between us there is nothing. We no longer mix the personal with professional. I hate you. And nothing in the world can change things.
