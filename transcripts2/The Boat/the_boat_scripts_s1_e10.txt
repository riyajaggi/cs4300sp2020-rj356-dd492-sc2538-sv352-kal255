 Ulises here. Can anyone hear me, please? Can anybody hear me? 8 HOURS BEFORE. Okay. One, two, three. Good morning! Crushing! Oh, daddy, daddy, I have to pee! - I have to have to pee! - No, you run to the bathroom, no beds, run. - And this? - Have you seen, what do you think? The trip turned into a luxury  cruise with breakfast in bed. Ah, I'm fine, just fine. But I don't know what to think of the fact  that you bring me breakfast, not your boyfriend. Is everything okay with Gamboa?

 No, not good. Not good. What is it? Don't you ever get the  feeling you're making a mistake? I don't know, maybe I'm rushing things and I'm going too fast. Listen... I'll tell you what I would tell your mother. If you have doubts... take your time. How do I take time if... if I just moved into his cabin? - No, I have to stand a little more. - Hey, baby. You don't have to stand for anything, huh? What you need to do is be happy. And if you need some time... or even to leave Gamboa... then leave him. Because the most important thing is you, My sparrow. And then, if you bring me breakfast in my room every day... you can return to your family whenever you want. come on... Oh my! You have to change the sheets. You see now! I like my family because when you  spill coffee and stain the sheets... nobody cries or gets angry, we just laugh. I got the cockroach! 13 to 1. What a day, yours. Damn it! - Haven't you seen the grouper? - What grouper? A whale, like you. It ran away, that bastard. What do you mean? You come up to  sluggish and it ditched you, Dad. If you want to fish you have to go on  one of those trips where you bring the bait. 57th 00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:14,769 - You are old now! - Yes, on a trip. Let's go on a trip. Here are the big ones and  here are the small ones. 60th 00:05:24,877 --> 00:05:27,234 Don't ask me about scars? Scars? Come on, don't be a sissy. Look at this, sucker. Mazarron, nine points. A shot of a fin tuna. What are you doing? Finisterre, 13 points. Moraine... It went through my wetsuit and I had to pull out an eye because it wouldn't let me go. 67th 00:05:52,455 --> 00:05:55,784 - Malvinas Argentina, a tiger shark. - What?! And I was only grazed! Then I'll show you that of a swordfish... It almost pierced my leg in the Canary Islands. Finished, you give up already, right? - Yes, yes, I give up! - What a great sailor you are, huh? What is it, Burbuja? A minute ago, the fog was not there. It's strange. It doesn't carry moisture. And the fog always brings moisture. El Barco - 1x10 - Fog - Traduzione e synch: Saropula, johanna.p, Alle83, PanCeraRosa Synch check: ziomele Revisione: Allison Can I help you? - With what, with sardines? - Yes. Let it go, let it go. You're not a woman to fish. I'll do it. - And why? - Why not, because you're a scientist... - And teacher. - And family. Also, because you're the girlfriend of  my boyfriends son, so "nuorastra." - What the hell! - "Nuorastra", the horror! But no, you don't have a  serious relationship, you two? Yes, yes, and we are already looking  for an apartment, right, Julia? You don't say, with rents there are... - But this? - What? I heard a strange thing. - What? - What? Look. It's a ring. It's heavy, huh? How did it end up in the belly of a fish? Simple. Someone had dropped it into the sea. FOG Or maybe it's a sign. Of what? That... the family should be formalized, as God intended. - No, champ? - But feel it... What do you think, I'm afraid? Well yes, actually, yes. You're wrong, I've been afraid for twenty years. Enough. Give it to me. Now you'll see. Hello, blondie. Will you marry me? - Stop it, Julian. - Salome. - Enough is enough. Shut up and leave me alone. - Salome. It's the ring of the dead  and it's not at all funny. Leave me alone, Julian. - Here are some ideas... - Salome... Alright. Look, I just created the perfect woman. With this program everyone can create his goddess. Let's see, I miss the mouth. Let's see what to put. Vilma. Look what I found in the hold. Sheep's milk. - They say it's twice as nutritious. - It's not fair, Palomares. This is for everyone. No, Vilma, this is for your child, okay? The rest of us are already old enough. Thank you. I'm just going to see it. I have an appointment with Piti  to have an illegal ultrasound. Have you seen him? Yes, he should be upstairs, in the club. Look, anyone recognize  whoes melons these are? Estela. Two rescue buoys, fuck. And this little mouth? Whose is this pulpy little mouth? Ainhoa, fuck, Ainhoa! There you are right! And you didn't put anything of Vilma? Vilma? What do you want to put of Vilma's, the baby bump or cellulite? No, no, no. Vilma didn't  pass the fragmentation test. Piti. Hello Burbuja! Hello Burbuja! Hello Burbuja! Hello Burbuja! - The fog doesn't repeat the echo. - This yes. It's like a wall. It's like a wall. Or as if the wall was hidden behind. A wall of granite. Attention, engine room! Engines, you hear me? Over. Yes captain. - Stop the engines immediately. - Aye, engines. Out. Why doesn't the radar work? Ulises! Good morning princess. Whither away so happy? Maybe you can be Ainhoa's boyfriend. Oh yeah? And how is it possible, if her boyfriend is already Gamboa? She left him because she doesn't  like him anymore and I don't either. He knows all our secrets and we don't know his. He knew what I had brought,  the witch and other things. And I didn't tell him. He scares me. You don't have to be afraid. I am on this ship to protect you... okay? And Ainhoa? Ainhoa as well. - Bye, little princess. - Bye. - Good morning. - Hello. Thanks, but... I've already had breakfast. You get up half an hour before me, you have breakfast on your own... it's not easy to be a  romantic boyfriend with you. Well, that is... I don't know, I want to talk about this,... I don't know if I would've lived with you like  this on land, without really... knowing you. What do you want to know about me? When my birthday is? My passions? - The stories I've had? - No. It's not about that. I don't know, it's something more. It's... it's knowing what's important to you, knowing what excites you... and knowing what hurts you. What hurts me most... is loss. Then, there's no better way to know eachother than when you live together, don't you think? You beat up Ulises? Captain,  today I robbed my companions, because   this situation brings out the worst in me.  I can't stand to live adrift,   knowing that we are destined to die.  I am sick, and I want to end   all this as soon as possible.  I'm sorry.  I'm not going to live with a violent person. You're right when you say we don't know eachother. Because nobody leaves me. - You all right? - Yes, yes. "The fog caught up with us... devouring the same way the  black ocean and the blue sky. " "It happened so fast..." "It was as if a cloud had fallen over land... erasing the horizon... and any trace of land before our eyes. " "Just the sound of animals and shots of the buckets against the windows... made it possible to understand that  the city was still there... but some did not want to stay. " May I? Hello. Hello. If you want... everything is ready. Okay. I go, eh? Let's see. Look, see how fast the heart beats? Look, it's turning now! Here you can see perfectly. - Do you see it? - Yes. What do you want it to be, male or female? - Female. - Female. Hopefully it is a female. I think it's a male. - Come on! - Yeah, look at this appendix. See? It may be the umbilical cord. Sure you can already see  the sex of the baby so soon? Well, no. I am a priest, Vilma. What should be here with you... is Piti. Piti no, Palomares. Forget Piti. Well... if things with Piti don't work... I'm not a nurse, but father yes... and I'll be here. As a substitute father, confessor and whatever will be needed. Okay? Unless we fix the radar, we can not move forward, Julian. This fog is the worst that could happen. Well, the worst... I Have worse things. For example, asking your girlfriend to marry you... and see her throw the ring in your face. What do you think? He had said it in a joking way, but I think the proposal was serious. It was neither serious nor a joke, how do  you make a proposal with a dead mans ring? But please... look. "Karen and Anton forever." Shall I tell you what he has lasted the forever? There was a party atmosphere and I threw myself in. Without thinking. What the hell, it seemed like a nice thing. And now I feel like a jerk. Fuck! What do I do now with a girlfriend  who refused me? What do I do? Listen Julian, you find a ring inside  the guts of a fish and what do you do? "All right, I'll jump." As if there was an engagement  ring in Kinder egg, Julian... What are the chances that a fish swallows a ring, that it reaches the ship, you open it ... and that your boyfriend uses  it to ask you to marry him? - Don't you realize how magical that is? - Ricardo... There are twenty years that I let  opportunities slip before my eyes. I know that finding a ring in a fish doesn't mean anything, it's stupid. But I won't ever be with my arms crossed  looking at the life that escapes me. No, what De la Cuadra did is not magical. It would be magical if he had spent sleepless nights looking for the right moment, to chose a ring, that trembling voice, that sparkle in his eyes as he asked me.  That would be magical. But to throw it there as if  nothing had happened, no. And if I had found a crucifix what would  he do, asks me to do the first communion? Magic, she says. - What is it? - They took the radar stabilizer. - What? - They took the entire piece. Gamboa. This look familiar? It's the notebook in which Martinez wrote the letter before committing suicide. What was it doing in your drawer? You've killed him. I'd give you an explanation, but now I'm in a bit of a hurry. - Leaving the ship, I'm leaving. - How are you going? Where? It's suicide! This is no place for me anymore,  so I take a lifeboat. I will survive better alone  than on this ship with you. - And with that captain. - Don't go anywhere, okay? You are a fucking murderer  and you will not go. You really think you can stop me? Do it, do it! Come on! Search, Mrs. Chipi. Search. There are sailors in the bow, aft, port and starboard, but you can't even see one meter in this fog. If you want to take a boat, and organize a search. A search for what, Julian? To find a corpse with a  bullet floating in the ocean? Hell, to find the asshole  who stole the gun and fired it. There was blood on the deck. So in addition to a wounded man, we also have a murderer adrift. Missing a lifeboat, then whoever it was, he had decided to leave. This makes absolutely no sense, Ricardo. Where will they ever want to go? The only thing that exists in the world is this ship. - We checked again and he's gone. - Who? Ulises. He's one of the castaways. Ulises is gone. - Ulises? - And the other is... is Gamboa. You have to come to help, even if the clothes are dirty. And do that with eyes, because there is a lot of fog. Thirsty. Come on. Are you sad? Because Gamboa is gone... or Ulises? For both of them. For both of them. Mom said that when you lose something, you must close your eyes tightly, and think about the last time that you saw it. And then it reappears. Shall we? Okay. Burbuja, you too. Me? one, two and three. - Friends? - Friends. No, no! Valeria, you know what would be even better? If you go, change clothes and brush your teeth. If you do, then perhaps  I will read you a fairy tale. Come on, hurry. "The reality began to change," "without any sense." "It was totally weird." "And confusing." "It was as if the fog absorbed everything," and things they no longer had a meaning," "as if they were lost in the mist," "as if people forgot who they were... " "or why they were there." "And were looking impossibly  for a reason to go on." Vilma, look. I put your knees, I think it's better. We know that a girl, to be the number one, needs good joints for genuflections. I don't give a fuck about  your perfect woman, Piti. You know what I really care about? Hearing you speak of me with contempt. And the first thing that  comes to mind is to slap you. I'm making excuses or... Piti, when I asked you to be the father of my child, it was because I wanted a family for it, because families love each other, they protect, they respect, they say good things, they give gifts at Christmas, they prepare the orange  juice in the morning, or a hot bath if it's cold. But the two of us are not like that. And since I will be the mother one hundred percent, perhaps the father can't be you. Vilma... Gamboa! Gamboa! Gamboa! Gamboa! Ulises! Ulises! Ulises! Ulises! Gamboa! Gamboa! One of them stole the gun  and shot the other, Julia. So think about it, Ulises and Gamboa had problems, right? I don't know. I don't know. I think... I think yesterday they had a fight. And you waited twenty-four hours to tell me? Why did they fight? Julia, maybe one of them killed the other, Why did they fight? Why did one of them steal a lifeboat? Did Ulises have a reason to want to leave? - I don't know, I don't know! - Julia! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Julia, I'm sorry. Come on. Ulises is all that I have, captain, he is my family. - And if he doesn't come back, I... - All of us... we are a little like a family. Look... Ulises is one of the strongest men of the Star. If he had not lost to another  there would hope, but he... I'm sure we'll find him. Now you simply have to wait. So the best thing you can  do is go into the cabin, and get some rest. Thank you. Miss Wilson... - What happened? - It happened suddenly. Maybe she was sick. - Can we take her to the infirmary? - Yes, of course. Even if you launch a rocket every two minutes, it would be useless. I know what it means to lose a man in the open sea. It's like looking for  a drop in the ocean. It's impossible. Don't talk about impossible things, Julian. Because it would seem impossible to find a faith in a conger eel, and I found it. We will find your son, even if we consume our  eyes looking into the fog. Or even if I have to go there myself swimming, from wave to wave. We will find your son, so much as my name is Salome. I promise. We'll give him an hour. If within one hour he shows no signs of life, I go out to look for him. Here, the first officer. Turn on the sidelights, stern, and that of the head. Even the lights on the trees and those on deck. Like a fucking lighthouse. If we can't see them, at least they will see us. Ulises here... Ulises here, anyone hear me? Yes? Can anybody hear me? We entered the water, damn it! Shit, why is it taking them so long? They should recognize us by the radar. We're doomed. And I'm in a bit more than you. Navigation lights are on, this means that they are looking for us. I'll pull out the bullet. And you think that I will give  you my back after you shot me? You're losing blood. You know what that means? Sharks. So either you let me open the wound... or we will be the dish of the day, Gamboa. Thank you.  Drinking alone and with nothing   to celebrate is bad, right?  I don't know, if you  want me to to keep it and...  when you have something to celebrate   call me and we drink it together.  Snitch.   I hope you are happy and everything is fine.  You know something I don't know. - What? - Why would anyone steal a gun? Why did they shoot and  run away on a lifeboat? What happened yesterday? - Why did they fight, Ainhoa? - Who cares why they did it? Who cares! Now they're gone. They're gone... and something must be done to get them back. Relax. I'll move in a zig-zag, which is more secure. I won't get lost. I have twelve flares, two walkie-talkies, two compasses. Salome, Salome. - I assure you that I know how to return. - I know. I know that you'll find him. And ask him anything that you  don't already know about him. Like he went to school,  if he likes music. His favorite color, if he has allergies, if he is gay, his friends... How can he be gay? Don't joke. Can't you see that girl? - What if he were gay? - What the fuck... If I am to be his stepmother, I need to know everything. - He will be both our child. - Child, you say? What if he gives me a punch  makes me jump fillings. So is that a yes? - Will you marry me? - It's a "I don't know". You have already done enough  with the ring of the dead. Come on, come prepared and  thrown in the mist... which has the smell of an  old sacristy and bad luck. We'll talk after the other matter, when they happen. Move. Idiot. What the fuck are you doing? You start from the port side and I from the starboard. Did you know... you have to move in a zigzag  pattern not to get lost. In the bag there are walkie-talkies and flares in abundance. No way, Ricardo. You're not going anywhere. - It's suicide, fuck. - Then we suicid together, Julian. If you go, I go too. Do you want to get a move on? I have nothing to disinfect. In my bag, there's a flask. No, I'll do it. These men are under my responsibility. Don't you understand? It's crazy, you may not return. And you? This ship can not remain without a captain. "Flight 6254 to Buenos Aires, change course. " "Fuel sufficient for 20 minutes of flight. " "- Can you hear me? - We have seen land. " "We see land about 15 miles north-west." "Can anybody hear me? Let's see an island." "We saw an island. " They're transmitting the ship. "- It's about 3000 hectares. - Size estimated 3000 hectares. " "Start emergency landing." "- Thank you! - Tail Wind 28 km / h, 4500 meters. " "We're landing." "- We're landing. - Try to land. " "Let's try to land, guys." Did you hear that? We must go together, on that island, okay? Ulises, I have the last Coca-Cola in the world. And I know what we will celebrate. We will celebrate that  you're back safe and sound... and we still have many places to go and so many things to do together. In Miami, together. So you have to come back, You must promise me, please. Julian, I need you on the ship. I'm asking you to wait twenty minutes. Twenty minutes. Twenty minutes, Ricardo. Not one more. SONG: "To feel that there is something new," "magic." "To feel that there is something" "so it's worth trying." "Do you think there are days that are still to come. " "Do you think there are songs you've never heard. " "Think about..." "all you have to do yet." "Do you think there are stories ... " "that no one told you ..." Uli! Uli! "Do you think there are places ..." "that no one has shown you." "Think about ..." "all you have to do yet." Ulises! Ulises! Be careful, boy. I don't want to much excitement and  romance you will cut an artery. Come on. It's almost out, hold on  a little longer, hold on. It's almost out, I see it. Why are you doing this? You could let me bleed to death, throw me into the sea... and get rid of a problem. I want to bring you back to the  ship to get tried, Gamboa. So can you explain to Ainhoa... why you spied on her months before boarding. Your bullet. You have to come back! You have to come back! Honey... come on, my darling. Quiet. It's all right. Look at me. We'll find them both, I promise. Dad, it was him, I'm sure. I'm sure it was Gamboa who shot Ulises. I know, I know, I know. Ainhoa??! What's the matter? Come on, sweetheart. Come on. Ainhoa! Ainhoa, are you okay? What's wrong? - Ainhoa, what is it? - Wake up, love, wake up! Julia, what's wrong with my daughter? I don't know. I don't know, but we need  to get her to the infirmary. - Come on, quick, Captain. - Come on. Hurry. - Careful, a step. - Take it off, please. A step. - Seriously, just crap, why are you doing this? - Vilma... Vilma, please... - Vilma. - What? If you want then give me a slap, but wait a minute, please. - It's the worst time of my life. - Come on. Relax, trust me. Here you are. Wait a minute. But why all this, Piti? Well... I know you don't like joint showers... So here's your bathtub. Queen. The perfect bathroom. Water temperature... let's see... 38 degrees. Pieces of soap. Marine salt to purify. Candles, incense and... voila. Rested. The sound of the sea  is included in the service. I want to take care of the child. Got it? Because I am its step father. And as for now it is there... to do this, I have no choice  but to take care of you. Mademoiselle, s'il-vous-plait. Enjoy it, okay? Piti... The tub is pretty big. You killed Martinez? I ask because if we are not found... or if we get eaten by a shark... at least it will take away my doubt. You are a cop. Do you have any theories? Yes. I think you had forced him to write that farewell letter. And then you killed him, because he stole. An eye for an eye. True, Gamboa? Is it true that you're  in love with my girlfriend? Truth for truth. If we are eaten by a shark... at least we will not have doubts. Yes. It's true. Yes. I killed him. Let's see. She has pulmonary edema and airways obstruction. She died of lung poisoning. Maybe she breathed the  smoke from the engine room. Ainhoa has not been in the engine room. Then here there are no toxic fumes. It 's ridiculous. It's the fog. It smells of a sacristy, and knows of sulfur. It seemed unfair... that because of a weak man, we had  to pay for all the lack of medicine. - And so that said you're the law? - No. This is the law of survival. How do you think you  last making nice and kind? People in extreme conditions lose their head. And you have to make decisions... that you will never be able to make. But I do. What are you doing on the ship? Why were you stalking Ainhoa? Who are you? Calm down. - Why don't you ask Julia? - What does Julia have to do with all this? By any chance do you know anything about her? Where she's from? Who she is? As you wish, but I warn you, the journey will be very long. Before I left, I had  tampered with the radar. - So they won't find us. - You son of a bitch. And if it wasn't the fog? Put this on. I'll go out to measure the  toxicity of the atmosphere. I'll go with her. Burbuja... stay with Ainhoa. Ulises here, anyone hear me? Ulises here. Can anybody hear me? Strong, no? That is, I am in a tub... with a naked girl, and I don't get excited, Vilma. It's incredible. It must be the pregnancy  hormones that neutralize me. No, I don't think so. I think... I think it's because I don't like you. And this is strange for  me, Vilma, because... - I've never had refined tastes. - Look, man, I like you too just not  that way, you know? - Oh, no? - No. To me you're like a brother. Or rather, as a mascot. But that's cool, right? Because if there is no interest... we won't quarrel ever. We will not make a scene, we don't want a divorce... And this... is perfect. So the child... will always have a family together. - Don't you think? -Yeah. Look, as a brother, mascot, or whatever you want... - can I piss in here? - Piti, I will cut you. - Don't even try it. - We need to increase the temperature, the water is cold. Vilma, Vilma... Okay, okay... In the mist there are carbon monoxide, fluorine and methane, Captain. The rupture of the earth's crust produces fumes from the center of the planet. If we continue to breath it, we will lose consciousness. The toxic gases will enter the blood... And we will die poisoned. And Ulises and Gamboa? They are probably already intoxicated. But perhaps it is not too late for the rest of the crew. What I do know is that  we should leave, okay? But I can not ask you to do so. I can't. Doctor... Come on... Don't worry... Ulises here. Ulises Here sending an SOS to the North Star. Can anybody hear me? Can anyone hear me, please? What was that? We gotta go. Attention, engines. Start your engines. Do you hear me? Over. Speaking the captain. Do you hear me? over. Ricardo... What the fuck? They are all unconscious. The atmosphere is contaminated. Protect your airways and go back into the cabin. Please, Julian! Engines running, Captain. - Got it. - You asked me 20 minutes... and you put the ship  in motion secretly, asshole? - I'm not moving, with my son out there. - Julian. Ainhoa also lost consciousness. If we don't get out of here... we will all die. Perfect. I order you to turn off the engine. I'll take the lifeboat. Julian... Even if you were two meters away from him... you wouldn't see him. I'm sorry. That is my problem. Order to turn off the engines. Order now to turn off their engines, Ricardo. - From the order. - Leave the walkie. I will not abandon my son. Julian! Ulises here, anyone hear me? Ulises sending an SOS to the North Star. Can anybody hear me? Can anybody hear me? Captain, please, can you hear me? Can anybody hear me? Can anybody hear me? Ulises sending an SOS to the North Star. Can anybody hear me? Can anybody hear me? Ulises sending an SOS to the North Star. Can anybody hear me? Ulises sending an SOS to the North Star. Ulises Here sending an SOS to the North Star. Can anybody hear me? "They did not realize what it was the fog until the end. " Hey? "When he had already erased the names of things and their memory. " Ulises Here sending an SOS to the North Star. Can anybody hear me? Hey? "When only remained words in the air. " Ulises Here sending an SOS to the North Star. Can anybody hear me? SOS to the North Star. Can anybody hear me? "Slowly turning on themselves." Ulises Here sending an SOS to the North Star. Can anybody hear me? "When it was already too late." Salome... Salome... Wake up Salome, please. Dad. Uncle Julian... Uncle Julian... Dad, please, please, please... Dad, please, please... You close your eyes tightly...  and think about the  last time you saw it.  Is anyone there? Ulises? Ulises, is that you? Snitch. Never thought I'd be so happy to hear someone in my life. Ulises, they are all unconscious. Dad, Julian... everyone. I don't know what happened... - I don't know ... - Relax, you'll be fine. Okay? I'm with Gamboa. In a lifeboat. I almost can't breathe. I see you, I see the light on the bow. We are not more than two or three miles. Ainhoa Can you hear me? Ainhoa. Ainhoa, can you hear me? Yeah, I hear you, then... you have to build a compass. In the life jacket, there is a magnet hanging on the whistle. You must build yourself a compass. They have taught how in a lesson, remember? Here it is, I have it. Well, now you have to find a needle. Or something of that  genre, and a cork. A needle. I'm sorry boy, I didn't bring my sewing set. Okay, I have the cork, and also the needle. You hear me? You must magnetize the needle, and drive it in the cork. Do you know how it goes, Ulises? I know how it goes. And I like to listen to  your little voice, you know? Give me a second, okay? One second. Ulises, my head is spinning... I don't know... there is... there is something strange in the air that... weigh on my eyelids, I don't know what... Hang in there. How else are you going to brag  about having saved my life? I did it, okay? Give me a second. Listen, we're in the south-east from you, 25 or 30 degrees. - All right. - From the port side. Alright. What do I do? You have to place the ship to go, you hear me? It's already turned on. How? You have in front of a lever with "forward" and "back" Make sure it is in neutral. Yes, it is in neutral.
