 Indeed an accident during the starting up the particle accelerator, it may have caused consequences of immeasurable proportions. If so, certainly the Earth now will be very different. Very good. Before my accident and... the bubble in my brain, I was smart like now? Not even half of what you are now. How lucky I was, right? You can choose to stay in the team of rabbits or in mine.

 But I will not accept more lies. - I want to be the winners. - Welcome to the team. Pay attention... if she turns to look at you while  she leaves after you have spoken. Because if she does... it means she likes you. I'm in love with Ulises. I'm in love... Must be very few left on the ship. You're not going to drink it? Drinking alone and with nothing to celebrate is bad, right? I don't know, if you want I'll keep it and... when you have something to celebrate call me and we drink it together. Is your boyfriend jealous? On this ship... you can't trust anyone or anything.

 Last lesson: for you, I'm nobody. He knows all our secrets and we don't know his. captain, today I robbed my mates. I did it because this situation brings out the worst in me. I can not stand to live adrift, knowing that we are destined to die. I'm sick, and I want to put an end to all this as soon as possible. There is no proof, but you saw the marks on his neck. That boy didn't kill himself. I'm absolutely certain. You're right when you say we don't know eachother. Because nobody leaves me. You are a fucking murderer and you aren't leaving. You really think you can stop me? We're missing a lifeboat. Ulises. He's one of the castaways. Ulises. We will celebrate that you're back safe and sound... and we still have many places to go and so many things to do together. Or even if I have to go out myself swimming, from wave to wave. We will find your son, so much as my name is Salome. What are you doing on the ship? Why were you stalking Ainhoa?  Who are you? - Why don't you ask Julia? - What does Julia have to do with all this? I want to take care of the child. Because I am its step father. And as for now it is there... I have no choice than to take care of you. To me you're like a brother. Or rather, as a mascot. Where is Gamboa? We only found Ulises. That's not possible. Gamboa was with me. No. Gamboa was with me. My father told me that many years ago, when he was small, things were different. The computers didn't exist, people traveled on horseback because there were no cars or gasoline. - We have no more fuel. - But nasty pu... And phones had wires. But there are also things we do just like daddy when he was little. Like when you like a girl, being afraid... That guy is believed the king of the ship and killed Gamboa. He killed Gamboa. Taking a nap, Take the collar off. playing with friends... Give me back the collar! or when you loose a tooth, and make a wish to the tooth fairy. Daddy, daddy! Not a single drop of fuel. From now on ... only with sails. Let's go back to the eighteenth century. - Here. - Thank you. You didn't sleep in the cabin. I slept on the bowsprit. It was too hot. Sure it's because of the heat? I needed to think. Anythng you need to tell me, Julia? Something about Gamboa? No. No. Why do you ask? For nothing. And you? Is there anything you  need to say to me? Ulises, what is it? Gamboa is gone and they want answers. And I don't have any. Ainhoa, Estela! Hey, Estela! What's happening? El Barco 1x11 - The Law Of The Sea - Translation and synch: Saropula, ziomele, johanna.p, Alle83, nina_bach Revision: Allison - How wonderful, right, Burbuja? - Yes. It's the first time that the crabs are in the pan alone. And we didn't even have to catch them. - The salt, you put it on. Two handfuls, honey. - Yes. The crabs are out of the water to lay their eggs, But, it's not yet season. For me it's as if they were coming for the holidays, honey. If the crabs are also over tuna and cod, even better. It's not even better. The crabs were up on the ship because there was something there that they didn't like. And that is not better. It's even worse. Be right back. The showers! Vilma, Vilma, what do  you have on your shoulder? Idiot! They are the crabs that attack you, they attack you! - Damn, this heat is not normal, right? - No. It's not even 9 and we  are already sweaty wet. Indeed. It is not normal that a bunch of crabs stick to you in the bed. It's super weird. Strange things are almost normal on this ship. Hey there! - Charlie prodigal, yes sir! - How are you, Piti? - How are you, Ramiro? - Murderer! What are you doing? Okay, Okay! Just calm down! Okay, Ramiro. Calm down, calm down. Estela. Estela, are you okay? You killed Gamboa. And you can pretend that nothing has happened, But I won't. And I'm not the only one. I'll take you to court for murder and I will condemn you. What is going on here? What is it? Everyone out, Come on. The first time I rounded Cape Horn, the same thing happened to me. Being surrounded by people in 75 meters can be stifling, right? You can't breathe. You want to be alone, but you can't. It's like... like the noise doesn't even let you listen to your thoughts. Right, Estela? Breathe. Breathe, relax. You were right, it's a panic attack. We have been confined here for weeks. It's normal that people feel trapped. Yes, it's strange that it hadn't happened yet. And with this damn heat. Can I do anything for you? Unless there is an island where we can be a little alone, I think not. Not an island, but I can give you a ship. Salo. Shh! Did you hear that? Shh, shut up. It's me! It's me! Stand still, you'll make marks all over the kitchen floor. What do you have on your shoes? I put metal plates. - Look at that. - The heat melted my feet. - It melted your feet? - Yes. Where, honey? Come, I'll show you. Come on. Ricardo, this is the most absurd order you've ever given, fuck. We're out of fuel, we have to organize the new guard of the engine room, and reinforce the shift to the sails, and you batch us here like sardines? One of the crew needs to be alone, and that's it. And she can't stay there another day? There is not a bit of wind. We are at more than 40 degrees. We may also be at 80. If we are to be here two weeks, we are. And if we go to the bathroom in turns, we will go in turns. Estela needs to be alone. so here we will stay. Don't be a pig, please. I feel much better now. It's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me. Thank you, Captain. You should thank the entire crew. Thanks, guys. - Great, Estela! - That's nice you are. Beautiful! Oh, God. It's like an oven here. Of course, the further you go down, the hotter it is. That's why I made these shoes. The crabs don't put up with it. That's why they came out of the water and went up on deck. I'll do a few for you, Salo. Can we talk, Captain? Sure. We demand that Ulises be tried for the murder of Gamboa. Are you kidding? Ulises and Gamboa have fought in class a few days ago. Ulises then waited for the right moment, when he met him alone on deck. He shot him... and threw him into the sea. He's a murder. Get out of my cabin now. I'm formulating an accusation captain. Taking advantage of the law. The law of the sea. If a crime is committed outside of any jurisdiction ... the code which applies... is the law of the sea. So since the eighteenth century. - I know exactly what the law of the sea is. - I don't doubt it, Captain. Without laws... anyone could take the  law into his own hands. And the North Star would no longer be a ship... it would become a jungle. Captain. Hello. Hello. We decided to... save it for something to celebrate. Well... you know, yesterday we gave you up for dead and now you're here alive, you know... I think we should wait. At least until we find Gamboa. So we both have something to celebrate. Snitch... Gamboa is a tough nut... much more than me. If I have managed to survive, he will succeed too. Okay? - Hey there! - What are you doing, Valeria? Where were you? Hello princess. What happened to your face? Well... - I lost a tooth. - Me too! You know that if you put your tooth under your pillow... you can make a wish to the tooth fairy? - Really? - Yes. Yeah. Why not ask to become my sister's boyfriend? Valeria, honey... why don't you tell Salome to prepare you a tray with lunch? go On. Ulises. I'm arrested, right? I'm tried for the murder of Gamboa? I'm sorry. You don't have to apologize... I know the law of the sea, Captain. Ow! - Palomares. - Piti. You priests... - Never turn on the paschal candle? - What? Do you have the flag hoisting? I knew it. I knew it. Me neither. For three days. It's not normal, actually. I think they are giving out bromide. Like in the barracks, you know? - Or convents. - Wait a minute, Piti. For three days you are at half-mast... - And because of this you think they're drugging us? - Of course. I was a child who fell into the cauldron of hormones, father. First... I just had to have the girl next door... and it worked, Father. But not anymore. I don't understand what's happening. For example, first, in the cabin I... A chicks neckline was right there, facing me. And nothing, that wasn't even my grandmother. - Hello boys. - Hello. - Good morning. - How are you? Good. I'll take a crab. You, too, Palomares? The cloth! What happened? Vilma! What happened? Close the valves and go up on deck, without a motor we need all the help... Without an engine we need all the help we can with the veil. What the fuck are you doing, Ricardo? I demand that you immediately release my son. - Julian, don't worry, please. - Relax a pair of balls. I told you to drop it, fuck. - My son did not kill Gamboa. - I know. The confrontation this morning is just the beginning, Julian. Many on the ship think that your child is a murderer. Would you rather have one of them make justice alone? If you don't want a revolt on board, we must lead by example, Julian. Your son has been accused... and should be prosecuted. It's the Law of the Sea, Julian. The law of the sea? Have you tried to read it? The murder conviction goes from exile to the gallows. What I'm doing, Julian... is giving him the opportunity to prove to the crew that he is innocent. What if it were Ainhoa? Would you put her in the same place... to prove her innocence? Answer me. Would you? And everything? Not much had happened on the lifeboat? Well... there would be... the Thai... who came to escort us and to bring two daiquiris. But it has nothing to do with the disappearance of Gamboa. Ulises, there is nothing to laugh about. How do you know Gamboa? I asked him what he was doing on the North Star and you know what he said? To ask you. Why, Julia? I know about Gamboa what you know too... he's not to be trusted. I'm sorry. Listen, I'm sorry, okay? Listen, now you shouldn't think of anything else than to prove your innocence. Because otherwise, they will leave you on a boat, with food and water for 15 days. It would be like a death sentence, Ulises. Do you understand? Ulises on trial for the murder of Gamboa. Crazy stuff. I need something stronger. Where's the rum? Ricardo asked me to be part of the jury. Really? Salome, please. Let's put an end to this shit. I'm sure Ulises hasn't done anything wrong. Yes. But I must be fair. If the accused is on trial... even if we love him. Do you understand? No. I don't understand. And if he is found guilty? Have you thought about that? He's my son, Salome. They will abandon him on a boat. Sure you want to take part in an execution? White or red? I have to give the bottle back to Salome... But at least we can choose. Estela... what... What is this? Its dinner, Captain. I just... I just wanted to thank you for what you did for me. White's better, right? With this heat. Crab? Look Estela, you don't have to thank me for anything. I am the captain... My job is to make sure the crew are well. Estela... I don't want to offend you, but... this is out of place. I'm sorry, Captain. I understand, Estela, nothing happened. It's just that... Can I offer at least one glass, right? Thank you, Captain. Thank you for... for everything. Coming. Coming! - What Piti? - Salome, I know. - What? - You are administering bromide. So that nothing down there works. Yes or no? Is it true or not? - No, Piti. - What do you mean, no? That's not true, it's not bromide. - It's not bromide? No? - No, honey. And one thing that is used in the Navy for years. Horse tranquilizers. That's not true! Horse tranquilizer? - Really, Salome? - No, not really, it's a joke! Of course not, stupid! Not bromide, or anything, go! Tranquilizer for horses... One, two, three, four, five... Honey... what are you doing here? Nothing. I was taking things that... I left here. - What did you want? - Nothing, that is, a little help. Valeria, is sleeping with her tooth under the pillow and I don't know what to do. I would swap it with a coin like when she was younger, but given the current circumstances, a coin has no value. For these cases, I have a survival kit. - Thank you. - your welcome. Good night. Honey... I am very sorry to tell you this, but... it was a miracle to save Ulises, and miracles don't occur twice. Do you think... that Ulises killed him? I don't think so. Eighty-five, eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety. One, two, three, four, five, six... I thought maybe you didn't have a pillow. Mamma mia, 49? at midnight. Never seen even in the tropics. Dad... Dad! Sixty-two, sixty-three, sixty-four... Look... there is no need for you to stay all night. I'm fine. I've been absent for many years, but my place is here with you. And if that mass of idiots, sons of bitches... decides to abandon you on a boat in the middle of the ocean, fuck them! Because I am with you. I'm your father, fuck. Sixty, seventy, seventy-one, seventy-two... Dad, what are you doing? Nothing, nothing, honey. Go to sleep, go on. Seventy, eighty... - Did you hear that? - Yes. - I'll go for a moment on deck. - Okay. One, two, three, four... Are they fireworks? Sure, honey. Go to sleep, okay? Sixty-nine, seventy... One, two... - Did you hear that? - Yes. They are bombs, it seems like an armored vehicle. Neither bombs nor the collisions make this noise. - This is different, Julian. - Fifty-eight, fifty-nine... - What is that noise? - A bombing. - At 70 or 80 miles. - Julian... they are not bombs, if they were, we would see the light of the explosion. Must be thunder. It's a storm. Thunder comes with lightning, Ricardo. At my house, the flashes have a glow more intense than explosions. Forty-three, forty-four... There are no flashes. And not even a hint of wind. Fifty, fifty, fifty... No explosion, no thunder. This is something else. Hello, Vilma. I need your help. What's up, Piti? I... I have a little problem... with little Piti. What the hell are you saying? And it... doesn't prick up anymore, Vilma, it doesn't prick up anymore. I thought that, as a friend... you may be a little sexy for me. Maybe you could give me a... a show to see if it rises. You're out of your mind, buddy. You're freaking out of your mind. Yes, you're right. I'm an idiot, forgive me, I don't know why I'm talking to you about this. Piti, come here. So? Do you feel anything? I feel the softness and... a part of the nipple, but just in passing. Don't make me turn away, if you hear something that excites you. So, are you excited? No. Actually no, Vilma, nothing. Look, man... I tried. In any case, I like it most... Piti, I think men are more responsible, when they are stunned to look at cleavage. Really? - Yes. - Yes. Ramiro... Are you sure of what you're doing? Ulises, it's time. Captain... what was that noise last night? I don't know. But it is no longer around 5.00. Prepare. The trial will take place in half an hour. Now, what the hell's going on? The heat blew the batteries. The heat or the explosions last night? Whatever it is, Santolaya says he can fix it, but he won't in this temperature. We must get away from the heat. The wind is less than two knots. Ricardo... so we won't move even with all sails in the world. It's impossible. Without a generator we have no drinking water. In this heat we need three to four liters of water per day. With our reserves we won't last even to tonight. We have to get out of here. But how? We are a dead weight. I could distill the fuel at home. I need alcohol, olive oil, a catalyst and all the bleach that we have on board. With a little luck, I could distill 20 liters. Would that be enough? With 20 liters the engine would work for six minutes, there would be enough to generate inertia and create wind alone. Try it, doctor. Julian! The crew must be ready to sail. Come on Ricardo! If you think... I stray from my son right now... forget about it. There is only one law, above the law of the sea... and it is the law of the father. You have one, two, three, four... - Five... - Five... - And six. - So what will it be: seven or six? - Six. - That's right. Six apples. - Ainhoa... - What. Can you steal? No. No, no, you can... you may, you may give, but do not steal. Why? When the fireworks started, I saw dad, he wanted to steal. I think he scared The Tooth Fairy, because it didn't take my tooth. I don't think Dad was doing that, you know what instead? Dad is curious, and I believe that he was snooping... because he wanted to try to see the tooth fairy. Since the old don't loose teeth, he certainly was envious. Grandma Chita'a teeth fell out. And then she put them all together in a glass of water. Let's see... This, three pears and five pears, How many pears in total? If you loose a tooth, what would you ask for? I would ask... to tickle my sister. With lots of tickles! Montero... Dr. Wilson wants you in sickbay. Okay, thank you. According to the code of the law of the sea, I chair the debate between Ramiro Medina and Ulises Garmendia. The accused has the floor first, Ulises, tell us exactly What happened that night. I don't... I didn't trust Gamboa. I went into his cabin and... I found a notebook, the same notebook in which Martinez had written his farewell letter. The next page of the notebook was still outlined, Captain. Gamboa had forced Martinez to write that letter. - And then killed him. - That's a lie. - In addition, we are not judging Gamboa. - Ramiro! I suppose you can prove it, right? Where is the book? the notebook was on the lifeboat. The first thing I did was throw the book at Gamboa... but that was before the fight. - When I had launched... - Ulises, Ulises... what fight? Palomares, I... Could you help me a minute, please? Blender, a scale, tubes, alcohol, industrial oil. - Catalyst? - Here it is. - Bleach. - Perfect. There are seven liters. Don't you think we should talk about how we are in love with the same man? - Look out! - Shit! There. There. Really, I'm sorry. - I don't know... I don't know what... - Ainhoa, stop. - Stop, stop please, Ainhoa. - I don't know why I'm doing... Listen to me. Ulises and I once talked about the fact that... you can't choose who you fall in love with, because you can't control it. It's not something that happens... little by little, but... overwhelms you, like a tsunami. What do you think? Methyl alcohol. Two liters. I saw Gamboa on deck wearing a wetsuit. I told him what I had discovered, then he pointed the gun. May I? Just like that I was about a meter away, I went, and put my head on the gun. He was distracted for a moment, I grabed him and held him in this position, at that time there was a shot that wounded Gamboa in the back. We fell into the water and... the gun remained on deck, as... as you already know. One more thing, Captain. In the cabin of Gamboa I also found a folder, with pictures of Ainhoa, of her daily life, when she was still on land, - Before we were to embark, Captain. - What are you saying? Ainhoa and Gamboa didn't know eachother. It's impossible, Ulises. Impossible? In the drawer under his bed there is a double bottom. The photos are there. Just go and look, Captain. Estela! You know anything about the trial? Nothing. - You think it's a good or bad thing? - I don't know. Ready? Tap. Drip. Guess who I kissed last night. Who? Well, he's very serious, well dressed, with a woven hat. No. Yes. The captain? Yes, but wait, it wasn't like a kiss from the movies, you know? He was frozen, but he didn't remove me. And if he didn't remove me, it means that he liked it. Or not? Julia and I saw the marks on Martinez's neck. That boy was not suicidal, he was strangled. Captain. We searched Gamboa's cabin. No sign of the photos. The photos were there. Someone has taken them. Captain, when we've finished judging the dead, I will continue to judge the living. You're welcome. You admit to the fight with Gamboa. Yes. - You admit to following him up on deck. - Yes. - You admit to shooting him... - I told you yes! - But I didn't kill him. - Someone else see you on deck? Have you seen me on deck? No one? Dad, you saw me on deck? No. Captain, I haven't studied law, but I think there is only one word when the only witness is the one who shot him. Guilty. Neither did I. I didn't study law, Ramiro, but I believe that it serves another word: motive. The day before, Gamboa beat up Ulises. He destroyed his face. - The day of the mutiny... - What the fuck? - Julian. - I had a fight with the sailors. Always. Ricardo, you too have had a fight, what the fuck. It is part of life on a ship. And what do you say? He hit Ulises, and you  think he wanted to kill him? Dad. Relax. The first officer is right. It's not a sufficient motive. Captain, I swear I wanted to save you. Really. But if you want a motive, I will call your daughter to testify. Put on your glasses. Come on. We must do it together. - Okay. - Come on. Careful, careful, careful. I beg you. Doing this mixture at this temperature is like handling a bomb. It's usually done in less than 30 degrees, and here there are 55. - Okay. - Well. Come on. - Yes? - Yes. - Julia. - Yes. I just want you to know something. I have never interfered, nor will I ever, between two people who want to stay together. A tsunami doesn't choose  which homes are swept away. It destroys everything. Ainhoa, you have to go to testify. Girls, this heat is not at all normal. Hell, I think... guys! I will take a bath! To hell with the rules! Who is coming? Come on! Come on! Shall we? Yes, let's go! Come on, come on, it's inhumane! No! The water! No! The water burns! Help! Sometimes Gamboa, your boyfriend, you talked about the problems he had with Ulises? Well, no... they weren't thick as thieves... but it's not a reason to kill someone, right? And why do people kill? For love? Is it true that you're in love with Ulises? - Must you ask that? - Captain, I'm giving you his motive. Ulises and Ainhoa are in love. Answer me, you love Ulises? I... I'm not going to answer because my love life has nothing to do with this. Enough. We all noticed, after your embrace on the deck, and by the loudspeaker. - You love Ulises. - Ramiro, that's enough. - Do you love Ulises yes or no? - Enough! - Ainhoa, you love Ulises yes or no? - The captain just told you, right? You wanted to be together, but because of Gamboa it was impossible. You knew, and that's why you killed him. - Stop it! - Do you love him, yes or no? - Ramiro, I told you to stop! - You love him, Ainhoa, yes or no? - Enough! - Do you love him or not? Enough! Enough! It was me. I killed Gamboa. Wounded man! Wounded man! Move, guys, please, guys. - What's up, Piti? - He was burned, Captain. He was burned, he jumped into the water and was burned... The ocean is boiling, Captain! To the infirmary, fast! Ricardo, Ricardo. Remember when I locked Ulises in the hold? I told you I didn't recognize the smell. When dogs smell puppies, they recognize them. Well, now, yes, I admit that. I tell you that it was not him, no matter what he says. - I know my son is not a murderer. - Captain, you must come to see this. Come on! What the fuck is that? Sulfur. The explosions came from down there last night. Look. - What do you mean, Burbuja? - That we are on a volcano. And less than an hour it should start an eruption. We need to keep constantly hydrated with a wet cloth. I sedated him. He'll be all right, boys, don't worry. - Yes, tell me. - Julia, Ulises pleaded guilty. I'm sorry. Those clothes are wet, change it. Julia, we need fuel now. We are above an erupting volcano, that's why it's hot. What are you saying? That at any moment we may be buried in a sea of ashes. - Do you have the fuel? - Yes. - I have twenty-four liters. - Well, let's get them in the engine room. Where is the fuel? Hidden. Give pardon to Ulises and I'll tell you where it is. Vilma says my dysfunction is dependent on stress. - I'm not surprised because... fuck! - Being in love is very stressful. What? Well, you lie continuously to... convince yourself that it's not love... must be exhausting, no? What do you mean? Drink the wine starting up every now and then, right? - Love, how can I be... - Piti. This is happening to you because you're in love with Vilma. No. No, no, no. Me in love with Vilma? And you are Buddha, don't say stupid things. - You're out, man. - Can we help you, guys? Yes, yes. Here, soak these bandages, okay? Hurry. Julia! I order you to tell me where the fuel is now. Leaving Ulises on a boat means sentencing him to death. If you want the fuel you will terminate it. I can not go against the law! Then we will all die! I don't believe you. You're not capable of endangering the lives of the entire crew. You underestimate what one can do for love. Wouldn't you have done the same for your wife? Julian, I can't give pardon to Ulises, he pleaded guilty of murder. Switch the worth. Rather than leave him on a boat, give him life imprisonment, He will stay locked up forever in the damn hold. We both will face the crew. I ask you please, Spare his life. Fuel for life imprisonment. Fuel for life imprisonment. Come on, fast. Come on. I don't want a drop to fall. Ricardo, what you are putting the big hurt. There are no smokescreens. How's it going over there? - We're filling the tank. - Well, it accelerates. The thermometer marks fifty-eight degrees and continues to rise. Will it work? Until the fuel heats up we won't know if the combustion is good. Sailors, you hear me? Full sail. We will have only one chance. Do not remove your jacket for anything in the world, please. Burbuja, honey, get yours, baby. I want you to keep strong at the tables, cling well. Come on, hang on to the furniture! Come on, Estela, come here. - Guys? - Yes. - Ready, Julian, start the engines. - Okay, at full throttle. You wanted a reason to celebrate? Well, now you've got it, fuck. The temperature of the engine exceeds three hundred degrees, you have to lower it. Loosen the valve fast. Loosen the valve. Julian, Julian, Try it again, come on. Open the air, I don't want a fire. Open the air, fast. Open. Two points of starter. You just committed suicide, you will die alone on a lifeboat in the ocean, right? You did it, congratulations, very good, very good! The pipes will not withstand. And you? You have nothing to celebrate? What would I celebrate? You made me look like a fool before the whole ship? I celebrate that? - Dad! Dad! - Valeria! Valeria, honey, what are you doing here? The fireworks scare me. Look, snitch... we are on top of a volcano, so stop the crap and get out or we'll burn, Ainhoa. Well, I'm burning, but I', not leaving, until you tell me why you were so stupid to admit to murder. Why? We have one last attempt. Come on, Little Star, come on. Get us out of here, man. Please, please, please. Yes, let's go! Yeah... it has already begun. It's already here. Valeria, baby, why did you come here? I'm here to give you my wish. It's not fair that I have wishes because my teeth fall out, and you don't because yours don't fall out. Ask for whatever you want and the tooth fairy will give it to you. Julia, Julia. Sailors, get this ship out of here. Go to the valve one to two and three. Open the little one. This two, with less pressure. - Get out of here, please. - No, not until you tell me why. Okay. At my signal close all at once, you know? Careful. - Tell me why! - Ainhoa, go away, please. Now! Julian, please try again. Fast! Get out of here, please. No, not until you tell me why. - Go on the deck. - No. Get a jacket and get on  a lifeboat, Ainhoa, please. No, no.
