 With the scientists coordinates we were just above the Dolina Santa Teresa, and there we had only grazed the storm. I think it was what saved us. An accident during starting up the particle accelerator, may have caused consequences of immeasurable proportions. If so, certainly the Earth now will be very different. Being surrounded by people in 75 meters can be stifling, right? - It's dinner, Captain. - I don't want to offend you, but... this is out of place. - No. - Yes. - So, was the thing true the other day? - What thing?

 - That you've always loved me. - Yes. It's... Well, if your... proposing marriage... the answer is yes. Love doesn't grow gradually. It comes in a flash and that's how I feel. While you... I don't know how you feel. I have never interfered, nor will I ever, between two people who want to stay together. A tsunami doesn't choose  which homes are swept away. It destroys everything. You can choose to stay in the team of rabbits or in mine. But I will not accept more lies. - I want to be the winners. - Welcome to the team.

 He knows all our secrets and we don't know his. Captain,  today I robbed my companions, because this situation brings out the worst in me.  You're right when you say we don't know eachother. Because nobody leaves me. You are a fucking murderer and you will not go. You really think you can stop me? I'm with Gamboa. In a lifeboat. Where is Gamboa? We only found Ulises. We demand that Ulises be tried for the murder of Gamboa. Gamboa is gone and they want answers. And I don't have any. I chair the debate between Ramiro Medina and Ulises Garmendia. Ulises and Ainhoa are in love. My love life has nothing to do with this. You wanted to be together, but because of Gamboa it was impossible. You knew, and that's why you killed him. - Do you love Ulises yes or no? - Enough! - Do you love him or not? - Enough! It was me. I killed Gamboa. No matter what he says. I know my son is not a murderer. What does Julia have to with all this? By any chance do you know anything about her? Where she's from? Who she is? I'm not leaving, not until you tell me why you were so stupid to admit to murder. - Leave me alone. - No. Tell me why. Because I love you. Valeria, honey. It's time to wake up. Oh, no! Not again, no! Valeria disappeared! But how could this happen? My God! The closet is the best place in the world to hide when you play hide and seek with dad. Found you! Even though mom didn't want me to hide in there. She said that if the doors closed I wouldn't be able to get out, and I would be very scared. Ainhoa, you're not gonna believe this. Your sister Valeria has disappeared again! - I don't know where she is. - No! She must have taken a boat, oars... - And sailed into the sea. - In the sea? And that is not the same as being locked up voluntarily, or reluctantly. Like when they send you to your room in punishment, because then you will  no longer want to be there. Even if it was the most beautiful place in the world. Ulises, get up. Come on. Ulises, don't joke. - he's not here. - Ulises! Fucking brat. He probably took a lifeboat and sailed into the sea. Come on, everyone on deck. - Fuck! - What's up, Dad? Not even when you're locked up do you stop to be cool? I realized that I had to paddle, so I came back. I have already been here three days and I don't want to spend anymore here. Well, then let me know... I have come to enjoy a game of cards. I may not be the best, but there is always a trump good. Dad. Know anything about Julia? She still hasn't come to see me. You know what you need? To move a little, change of scenery. Something going on? Look, kid, I don't know, I still haven't talked to her. Is it bothering you that much? Come on, hurry up. Take advantage of it, you only have half an hour. Exit to starboard, and pass through the bow. Come on. What? You practising for the Copa del Rey? We have any watchers? Don't you have to clean the deck? Yes, but our turn is in the afternoon. Yeah. The afternoon session. So you have nothing to do. Very well. Let's play 21, then. Why, can you play, De La Cuadra? A little. Then one on one of 21. Two against one is better. I'll let the cripple help you. Far be it from me to have discriminated... minorities. Very well. If you win... I'll take all your cleaning shifts this week. Is that okay? But if I win... you go to talk with Ulises every afternoon. I'd rather bring him down a book, to rub it in until we can no longer. One to zero. Thinking of something to talk about, father? Come on! Bravo! Idiot, I'll kick your ass! No, you let me do it. Okay? Yes! Come on. I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright. - De La Cuadra! - Julian! - Don't you see he's hurt? Call Julia! - Call Julia! El Barco 1x12 - Liverpool Man - Translation and synch: Alle83, Saropula, miahu, johanna.p, ziomele Revision: Allison You already know that the shroud is the set for cables and equipment of a ship. This is why it is so important to control them, but we will, always and without exception, by using the safety harness. - Volunteers? - Me, Captain! Very well. Put the harness on. Imagine you are on mizzenmast. Which sails are there? I don't know, Captain, the gaff? It is precisely in flag hoisting, the gaff. - Is there a problem here? - Guys, silence. No problem, go ahead. Captain, I put it on right? You must attach the safety clasp. The harness must be tight at the waist. So strong string, Captain. MAN OF LIVERPOOL Are you having fun? I remind you that our life is at stake! Remove the harness immediately. Does anyone here want to seriously learn? Me, Captain. But there are only two minutes left, so no. The lesson is over. Did you see, Palomares, with the harness, tightening and tightening... Don't make any noise. What's up, Burbuja? Can't you hear it? He's out. What was that? - I don't know, it's the air moving something. - No. The air doesn't make this noise. Come on, Burbuja, remove your hand from there, I don't like it. - Hold on. - Come on. They sound like... claws... scratching on the metal. There is something alive. The wind blows from the east. If you don't shit the line guard, the bow will begin to sway, guys. Are you locked up like down there? I am. For now I don't dropped the soap in the shower. But... being locked up made me think about a few things. The first? I miss the smell of the earth. You noticed soon. - And the second? - I... I need you to answer the question Ramiro asked you during the trial. and what would that serve now? It's like in the hold when you asked me why I did it. I answered. Because I want to know if you love me. I don't know. You must know. Come closer. Come a little closer, please. When you are six to ten inches from me... I feel my heart beating in my throat. Tell me if you feel the same. Tell me. What does it matter what I feel or ... how strong my heart beats, if you're with someone else? Ulises, your time is up, we have to go. For the love of god, Burbuja, remove your hand from there! I feel it. I feel his breath. Burbuja, that's enough, it's not funny... Get off me! It's here. He's scratching. - You're biting. - Remove your arm, Burbuja, remove your arm! He must've gotten lost in the  ventilation ducts when they attacked us. What... what is that? Shoo! - Wow. - Let's see. It's a diary. That's so cool! Captain Javier Ayarra de Zuniga. On April 29, 1941. It's... the first captain of the ship. Then it was Leon de Olarizu, Carlos Mejia, Alonso Quesada... and another ten that... I don't remember. Then Captain Ricardo. What was it doing there? Today the North Star sets sail from port Santander directly in Normandy, with the objective to load scientific equipment in the port of Treport. rough seas did not stop us from sailing,   following the orders of the owner.  Surfing these conditions is safer,   in the circumstances.  In exceptional cases, we have passengers,   a pair of refugees.  The world is at war,  and we sail with   electronic devices off,  so that nothing can spot   when we enter the North Sea.  The crew is frightened,  but nobody questions orders.  They are good sailors.  Now I hope   to live up to them.  Shocking, isn't it? Look at you. He ran to you like a puppy, huh? Just hangs on your every word. Even if you kissed, I don't think that  the captain will have you for the holidays. Didn't you see How much tension there was, Vilma? Unless he liked me, he wouldn't have been so nervous. Then I don't like the captain, I love Ricardo. Wait, wait, come here. I'll tell you who Ricardo is. Ricardo is a man twice your age, widowed, with two daughters, one is your age, among other things, and the charge of the ship that keeps us alive. And these are all the flaws that you can find. You were not there, Vilma, when He embraced me. He came in and did not have to ask me what I had. He knew, that's all. He took me in his arms and... we started to breathe together, until I calmed down. You know how to feel such a thing? Yes, but such a man is not conquered by showing ass, Estela. The captain or Ricardo. - Do you expect him to ask you out? - Well, no. you can consider yourself a woman, or go back to flirting with Piti. Like a woman? What kind of woman, Vilma? Think, what would Sharon Stone do? Kill him with an ice pick? What do you want me to do, go to  Ricardo and say "I like you"? That, or draw hearts on his door, poems and send them on twitter. No, when there is age difference... certain steps you have to skip them, in love. Look up. Let's see... Okay. Strong arms. Here you are. - Okay. Done. - Okay. You want to analysis my urine? Sure... It's just that, this happened  because I didn't warm up. - Of course. - It happens. You worry too much. - Julian, you're no longer fifteen years old. - No, in fact. And you go to the doctor as to mass, little or nothing. It's a very sedentary life. And where do you want me to go? The food doesn't help, and smoking is making it worse. The food does not depend on me, I think. And I think I will stop smoking... in fifteen days. Twenty, if I organize myself well. You should do some sports. Yes, I tried this morning. Apparently I'm not very good. Julian, I mean it, unless you respect, we're not getting married. Let's be clear. Thank you, Julia. And then the leash and a muzzle. No? - Thank you, Doctor. - Welcome. - Julia. - Yes? Ulises... Asked me... about... you. Yes, yes, yes, I... I know. And in these days between... between controls, reports... Julia? Julia! Julia! - You must go in the hold. - I need to talk to her. - Just a minute, please. - No, let's go. Let me, it will take me a second. - Then we go down in a hurry. - No shit. - Get off! It will take a second. - No! - No. - Yes, fuck. Ulises! Leave the sailor alone immediately! I just wanted to talk to Julia, Captain. For me, you could also want to light a candle to St. Peter's! Enough is enough. Until further notice you stay in solitary confinement. All your hours of air are suspended. Take him away. Come on. It's like looking at the map of a pirate ship. But it is the North Star. It's still all the same. Look. The drawing is on 30 April 41. One day after the trip to Liverpool. Let's see. Time. By order of the owner, We diverted en route to Liverpool. We're coming into port. We restock the ship in the port of Plymouth.  we will continue through the cold waters of   Canal St. Giorgio.  The crew is unhappy.  I was forbidden to give   any explanation.  We have to pick up a strange passenger,  I have to protect ...  at the cost of my life.  He's a man of few words.  I just know that he is a scientist expert   one called nuclear energy,  and he is never separated from his briefcase.  Given the lack of space,   I had him stay in cabin 31,  which we also use as an infermary.  But it's... impossible. This ship has just... 30 cabins. And this map has only... 30 cabins. So we have to find a new map. Because this ship is missing cabin 31. The ghost cabin. A dinner! Yes? Captain, you have a minute? Yes, if it's something  professional or ship related. If not, I have to fix the documents, preparing lessons, - And do a lot of other things. - Maybe if I had fallen in love with Piti. Or any other guy. Things would have been much easier, but I'm in love with you, Captain. Estela, I'm sorry but I have no time for assumptions or sentimentality, please. If I have to have another anxiety attack... to be able to talk to you, I will, I assure you. I know you see me as a child, but it will always be so, because when I'm 10 years older, you will continue to be older than me. In 10 years you will have done so many things that you will have forgotten me, Estela. - Really. - And if not? And if I were still waiting will you see me as a woman? The way you spoke to me, the way you hugged me... you have emptied a ship just for me, Captain. - I would have done it for anyone. - You did it for me. Look at me. Forget that I am a student. - Let yourself go, maybe... - No, no. I can not let go. I am already at my place. And you must continue to seek another. You don't like me? You said you wanted to see everyone in love on the ship. Why can't it be the same for you? Hello. - No. - I come to find Ulises. I'm sorry. The captain ordered to keep him in isolation. Ainhoa! Ulises! Ainhoa! - What is it? - I'm sorry. I... I can't see anybody. Why, what did he do? Assaulted a sailor. I'm sorry. Captain. You have become quite a... heartthrob. Here. Its the class register. Julia... That girl is twenty years old. The uniform draws attention and she got thrown blindly. Well... I don't know how it happened. Well, in the same way that it happened to me. The world is upside down. And we do things that maybe we never would do. Yes, but she's the same age as my daughter, Julia. So is Ulises. And you have never criticized that I was with him. No, of course, but... for you it's different. He is a boy. He's in good shape. You are more like them. Ah, yes? Why... according to you, I am more... how? Because I am younger? Or... maybe it's because you think I am childish, - Immature? - No, no, not at all. I don't want to say this, but... you are in love. Even if you have not visited him after two days, well... or three. You want me to tell you why I didn't go to see him? I am sure that as soon as he sees me, he will leave me. The heart doesn't look at age. Nor what people will say, or a masters or pupils, Ricardo. The heart doesn't care about anything. So, in the end you have molded another kiss, to the captain. But he escaped it or he didn't move? No. I mean... yes, but I think it was because Julia came in. Okay, but if Julia had not come in. Something more would have happened? I don't know. The captain did not say anything like last time. I don't know what to think, Vilma. Piti! Come on, let's go! One second, one second. So, the men follow a pattern. And when we make the first step, they are locked. It mathematics. But why? Centuries of evolution, baby. They hunt and we are the prey. If you reverse the factors, the result is zero. Look. Piti... See? And that was Piti. If he let you continue, it's because he expects you to go all the way. All the way, are you sure? Totally. Vilma. I need your help. Yes. Two minutes, let me write down the material... No, we can't wait. We'll take a scolding. It's there. Do not touch the captains things they are sacred. Yes, but there's Palomares, now he is like the Pope Hey, guys. Piti, don't touch. - Officer. - Tell me. We found a diary of the Star. Which says that there are 31 cabins, but it is not possible, because the star has only 30. We need the maps to find the cabin. Burbuja, what is this? What are you talking about? It dates back to 1941. Look, there are pictures of the time, fragments of nautical charts, It's as Burbuja says, according to this, the ship is missing a cabin. A cabin? Zuniga? Don't tell me anything. - Where did you get it? - Burbuja found it in a hole. Zuniga was the first captain of the Star. He worked with the Resistance in World War II. Well, it's possible. This ship was a thousand things, before being a school. It was even a hospital. A quarantine hospital, in the 60s. According to the diary, an infirmary was here. Julian. I need to speak with you. But if you are... busy... No, no. Be right there. So guys, here is the map of the ship. Whoever finds the cabin gets to keep it. - Okay? - Thank you. - Let's see? - Let's see. Look, here is the deck. Okay. - Here are the cabins. - That's the upstairs, or... Yes. That's the upstairs. Look, the classroom. - Okay. - Well, let's compare. Okay, this is it. - We compare. - Alright. How do we start? With that downstairs? Even the pawns on the map want to know what's in the book. The pawns? It is magic! What's going on? Doctor want to shoot hoops? It seems like you did a sport. Volleyball. But I was not that great. I was too short to play. Can we talk alone? More alone than this! I got the results of your blood tests. That I have cancer? Won't turn around. With my family history. I smoke, I drink, I go for the fifty. I eat much red meat, low in fiber. I have cancer? Prostate cancer. But... I only saw tumor markers. Time? It's at an early stage. One, two years ... it's very difficult to know. There are people who resist a long time. And the treatment? I can only give you these. Are you telling me that if you and your friends... had not destroyed the world... and if the hospital Gregorio Maranon... was still standing... with chemotherapy I would have been saved? Yes. Will you do me a favor, Doctor? Don't tell anyone. Okay. That's it? Actually, no, that's not all... but life goes on. And I have to fix a few things... before the end of mine. Thank you. I always thought it would be the lungs. How does a magnet stick to a notebook of paper? Maybe Captain Zuniga has the answer. Let me show you something. The man we boarded in Liverpool had a strange disease... He was the first to fall ill.  Then it was the turn   of the vice captain, of the boatswain  and a French passenger,   Monsieur Richard.  disease spreads with such speed,  that the doctor can not   take care of the sick.  And I'm afraid we do not have   even medicine to  to treat them properly.  Liverpool man gave me the suitcase   should keep during his illness.  Inside is a strange box.  As the owner, made me swear   to protect it with my life.  - Let's see what the hell this key opens. - The box or the cabin. Guys, we have to find out! We must tell the captain. - Hey, Burbuja. No. - Wait, wait. Why do we tell the captain? Why to take us for fools, like De La Cuadra? First, we find the cabin and then you shout from the rooftops if you want. Do you agree? Okay, but If I find it myself, I want to tell everyone on the radio. I want to be the first. - Alright. - Done, Burbuja! - Alright. - Come on. I'll take this. Dad, listen to me. Before I asked him please. I would have done now. He took me by the arm, I didn't want to escape. - I would not go anywhere. - I already know everything. Whether I want to know the truth, it does not matter. Are you alright? - Yes, I'm fine. - Good. This watch was your grandfathers. So you won't ever forget who you are and where you come from. What are they going to do to me now? Hang me or make me walk on the bridge? No, damn it! It's not that. I just wanted to give you a gift. It's very important to me. And I wish that for you it was. You're the only blood family I have. Yeah. I... I don't... I can't accept it. Why not? Why? Sure you can. It's not waterproof, Dad. I can't put it in the water, damn it! Why do you always be an idiot? I'm telling you that it's very important to me. Fuck! This watch... is stopped at the right time... when the Constitution was signed in 31. Your grandfather was a convinced Republican and a great man. It was he who chose the color purple for the Republican flag. Do you know why? Not for Castile, nor for the Bourbons. For your grandmother. Her name was Violeta. Thank you. Look... why are you giving me the inheritance now? You okay, Dad? You know what? Before you when you called  me that it unnerved me. It was something I hated, really. But now I like it when you say it. "Dad." I am very proud of having given birth... to someone like you, Ulises. Come on. - Keep it with care. - Of course. I know. If there was something wrong, you'd tell me... right? Sure. Nothing. Look at this! No, forget it, Burbuja. We tried with all the locks of the ship. That key doesn't open anything. Hiding a key that doesn't open anything is stupid. However, there is something else again. There are cabins all over the floor, but there is no room for the cabin 31. Perhaps, there have been changes over the years... They have built something over it and it disappeared. Maybe it's gone, but it was not on this floor. This plan is the same in both maps. Instead, the floor of the engine room, no. Let's see. Before... Before in the engine room there were no stores. And here's something. It's the Red Cross infirmary. The cabin we seek is below us. - Hello, boys. - Hello. We must leave this box in the hold. It's not possible. They are the orders of the captain. Okay, then you explain a crate with fragile material in the middle of the corridor. - Goodbye. - Bye. There is only Equipment. Fuck! What are you doing, snitch? Well, you see... I didn't know how to get into here... but it seems that getting on a ship in a box is easy. To be honest it's a bit uncomfortable and I don't recommend it, so... You're crazy. Wait. And your father? Ainhoa, they'll find out. How do you plan on getting out of here? I don't know, my plan was up to here. So... When I think about it... Since you told me that you missed the smell of the earth, I thought... not exactly the smell of the countryside, but it is the closest thing I could find. Nice of you. Now we only lack a shepherd, Sheep and create a farm. You did not want celebrate? Well... we found land! So... what do you prefer to plant? Sunflowers or daisies? - What are you doing? - Salome. I wanted to tell you that... I love you. And that the end of the world with you... I feel at home. I love you. Thank you. - I know it's not very romantic to tell you so. - No, it's very romantic. Look at me! I'm peeing with my pants down. Are you okay? Yes, very well. Are you sure? Yes. This says that it is the door of the infirmary. But it is impossible, there is no inventory. Yeah. Wait, stop... No, no, no... No, no, wait! No, not so. Give it to me, give it to me. Give it to me! What did we plant in the end? Well... We planted... Lettuce, tomatoes... and... petunias. Which is which? I have no idea, really. I don't know. We have to wait for them to grow to know, right? Sounds good to me. I have all the time in the world to see them grow. Look Burbuja, that was not previously a warehouse. See? Hold it. It was a passageway to the infirmary, therefore according to this... the cabin 31 would be... behind us. - Move all this. - I'll help. Fuck, wait, we fucked up. Nobody move anything, listen to this. Our worst predictions come true. The doctor told me... that patients suffering from this   was called Spanish flu.  two of my officers  and a passenger are already dead.  In addition to the man from Liverpool,  whose body lies in the infirmary   along with three others dying.  I am forced to make the decision   most difficult of my entire life.  Faced with the impossibility   to stop the epidemic,  and for the safety of the rest of the crew...  I gave the order to seal the infirmary,  and wall them in alive.  For the rest, we can only pray that   they are still alive when we get into port.  God forgive me.  If there really is a cabin there, there will be nothing but corpses, huh? Then we must bury them. That is, in the sea, so their souls rest in peace. And can get out of the ship. Plague, Burbuja! That cabin is a fucking den of germs. The Spanish flu killed more people than the Plague, do you know? Piti... Burbuja is right. We need to give them a proper burial. - Come... - You're idiots, You are idiots! Why don't you hammer it with your fingers, too? - Maybe you'll like it. - Easy, easy. Valeria sweetheart, what is it? What are you doing here? Can't you see my daughter is right there? She's sleeping. I know you have a lock, that all this scares you, that your ethics makes you accept. - But what ethics... - Dad... what are you doing? - Why is Estela in your bed? - Because... because today I had my first lesson. And Estela had doubts, and she came to me to explain. Yes, 25 nodes are 46 km / h, not one more nor one less. Dad, she's taking your pillow... Yes, because ... her pillow is too hard and then him soon. And this is the last time I got it. If you have further questions, don't  ask me at all, put that into your head. - More on your side, there... - Yes, I'm doing, but which way? - You're not lifting, Piti. - Yes the other hand, Palomares! No, I'm alone and I'm bringing... Silence! A moment. - Let's see... - It's here. And this is the ghost cabin. Get something. Let's see, let's see, it shows, wait a minute. Get away... epidemic. Danger. - Fuck, fuck. - Go Fuck guys, that's a mausoleum. These are the names of the dead there, Please take note, let me pass. Miguel Botella... Forty-one years. Julio Abad, twenty-seven. Jose del Cabo... thirty-four. Guillermo Mejillas, twenty-two. Rafael Sarmiento... twenty-nine. Piti... if it was your family, would you leave them in there? Palomares, I'm not that attached to my family. I won't open it even as a joke, you're safe. - You are sissies. - Yes, indeed. I am already here... I'm not leaving without seeing what's inside. Neither am I. Don't laugh. I'm trying not to fall asleep. You're touching my leg? Well... When I touch Piti's legs nothing ever happens. You even kiss Piti's arms? When it's tender, yes. And I also give him a spank on the ass when crossing corridors. Yeah... - But at the moment my butt is off-limits. - Okay. What will happen with Julia? I can not talk to her. I don't want to be like a tsunami that destroys everything. I won't. No matter what happens it will not be your fault. It will be only mine. We will never be a normal couple? Flowers when they come out of the pot. Thank you. - Come on. - Throw that away. - The other. - Get it out, Piti. Here you are. The door... Come on. - Pull. - Come on! Okay. The cabin 31. The infirmary. - Doesn't open. - No? - It is open. - It's open? Ulises. Ulises, Ulises, Ulises. Hey, Ulises. Help! Someone call Julia! Help! Ulises, wake up. There, now you have your cabin. Which one goes? Me, by myself! Fixing to enter any place without knowing what's inside. Damn, that sucks! Stinks more and more. You make me sick. You are sissies. Wait, that's the box. Who the fuck is that? I know, Piti. One of the poor souls who died here. It's Captain Zuniga. It's impossible. What the hell are you doing here Captain Zuniga? Look, let's go, come on. - Piti, wait! - Let's go! Wait a minute, wait! Look, see what the diary says. Come on, get it. Come on, give me light here. Here, here... To no served measures to contain the epidemic on the ship. Three days ago he fell ill... Three days ago there was a final sick   member of the North Star.  Me.  Captain Javier Ayarra de Zuniga.  On the 3rd of June 1941.  Having the task of protecting   the rest of the crew,  and the duty of avoiding   the infection across the continent,  I ordered the same reserve   end decided for the first infected.  To be walled up.  I will take with me the desire to rest   forever in the North Star,  and the terrible truth that hides...  Hiding what? Missing pages, have been torn. He spoke of the case, Open it, I am sure that the key is to the case. We'll do what you want, Palomares, but in another place, let's go please. Look... Captain Zuniga has more than one. Burbuja... take the box, please. Come on, come on, open it in your cabin, okay? - Come on. - Okay. Come on, I feel sick. So ... goodbye to all and thank you. - Valeria, plug your ears. - Are you going to fight? Yes, but it will only last a minute. You disobeyed me as a father and as captain. You have challenged me, You took advantage of my trust... and ridiculed me in front of my men. First Executioner, then judge and jailer, all within one week. - I don't know you anymore, Dad. - I am the captain of the ship. I make tough decisions, however painful, it's part of the work. I left Gamboa before he disappeared. If it were me? Would you do to me what you are doing to Ulises? You're grounded. Don't leave the cabin for the next ten days. You wanted to be locked up? Well, there you are satisfied. Why did you do that? What? You were poisoned with zinc. The powder coating some parts of the ship. You know perfectly well that you care with milk. Because there was no other way to see you. I'm sorry. I too was dying to see you. But I think that our motives were different. No? I'm sorry. I was wrong. Yes. Okay guys. He was referring to this box. The awful truth locked in this box. After the last conversation with the scientist I understand... vaguely the project scope   he's working for the Allies.  The danger posed by the use   of uranium by the military...  and what he calls   new nuclear weapons.  His studies did nothing   that portends disaster.  talks about geological cataclysms.  I don't know if I talked to a genius   or a fool.  I just hope that the future described by him   remains nothing but literature...  locked up in this box. Come on. It opened. - What is this stuff? - They are charts. - That's it? - Yes. Documents. No gold, I think. The whole story of protecting with their lives, so much mystery, for all this shit? Well come on, at least we have solved the mystery. It's treasure. And we found it. - I'm leaving my part, Burbuja. - Alright. Mystery of the cock. Burbuja, why are you going back and forth? I wait to wake up the captain, I have to show him something. Can't you wait for him upstairs? No. It's too important. Listen, come on. Maybe tell me first... so let's see if you should wait or wake up the captain. Come on. What are you doing here? Have you been crying? No. It's my glasses. I spent too much time reading. And there are cabins where there are no towels. If you want we can go for a walk. So you make them rest. Like a date, but... but among friends. Ainhoa. So, what have you found that's so important? I can't leave. To someone who is in love  that doesn't seem to matter. This chart is very old. And it lacks a lot of islands. In fact, now that the world is no more, it is all about too much. And there are seven sinkholes marked. It's not possible. Hello. Hello snitch. Look... now that I'm single... will you still invent an excuse not to kiss? No. And I can not wait for the flowers to bloom. I wish that we were a normal couple. Who wants a normal story when you can have one like ours? But it is impossible, this map... - it is from 1940. - Yes. Yet I haven't heard you say that you love me. I love you. And also marked the valley of Santa Teresa. It's where we were saved from the storm. I did not hear well, can you repeat that? And that line dropped out. Shame you you missed it. It was beautiful. The sinkholes have safe areas in case of upheavals of the earth. Where did you find them? In the ghost cabin. But if we are saved because we were in that place... if there were ships in other places it might have saved them too. No? Maybe. But almost certainly they are nothing more than fishing zones. Look, I'm sorry may I keep them? So I can look at them calmly. Alright. - Here. - Thank you. Look, Burbuja... there is no need to disturb the captain about this. Now? Now we can pretend that you are a sailor and I am the girl at the port. And if I did not ever go to harbor. Then I should escape every night with a boat. - I don't think the captain would like that. - He doesn't need to know. What if we organize an escape? No. Let's run away now. I love you. Attention. Captain, we found Gamboa. It's a miracle. Miracles do not exist. My phone. Message received. Captain, how is it that all of a sudden there is a signal. Someone is launching a call for help. A priest who plays the body of Christ. If I lose, I give up being a priest. But if I win, you give up on being the father of Vilma's child and I'll take care of it. I don't remember anything. I just know  that I'm alive by the thought of being here. But he is not my boyfriend. That is, and he doesn't remember... - I don't know how to tell him again. - Relax. Here school ship North Star, do you copy? - What is it? - Nothing. - Not an SOS and then disappear. - Unless it's a trap. They are bombing the ship signals. You used me and lied from the beginning. Now I want you to tell me who you are. I promised you that I would not have lied, Ramiro. But there are things I can not tell you for now. He's lying to everyone, and you are covering for him. Captain, you will not go to those coordinates right? I have a date with you? The romance is not dead. Yes, hello. We both have our secrets, but neither of them... will be said.
