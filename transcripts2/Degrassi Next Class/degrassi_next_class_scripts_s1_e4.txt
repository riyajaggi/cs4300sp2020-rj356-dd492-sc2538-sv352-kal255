 ♪ I wanna get off, get off ♪ [panting] - You wrote that? - Me? No. No, actually, she did. Not bad... but you're gonna need more than one song. Oh, we've got a solid 30 minutes with originals and covers. Well, my other girl band had to cancel... so you can take their slot. - 10:30. - P.M.? Unless that's past your bedtime? No, I'm basically nocturnal. And dressing nicer will help me sell more drinks. No problemo.

 If this goes well, it could turn into a recurring gig. - [Maya gasps] - [Jonah chuckles] Okay, guys... - we need new outfits. - [Grace] For a guy that thinks there's a difference between bands and "girl bands"? No way. Grace, who cares if he thinks we're a rubber band. Oh, yeah, can we please be a rubber band? - Guys, we just booked our first show! - [Jonah chuckles] - Okay, then it's settled. - [Grace laughs] We're going shopping. - I like to look good, too. - [girls giggle] [Zig] Need a roadie? - [squeals] - [laughs] Or a groupie? I can be both. [Mrs. Matlin] Can I come? Or is it uncool to have your mom there? Well, it's at a place called The Trap Door, and I guess you could come if you give me an advance on my allowance for a new outfit. The Trap Door? Isn't that a bar? Well, yeah, but they have a stage, and bands play there all the time, right? Sorry, but no. But I've worked my whole life for an opportunity like this. I am not letting my 16-year-old daughter go to a bar with drunk people on a school night. But Ed Sheeran played in clubs when he was only 14. - Ed Sheeran is a boy. - So equal rights are crap? When it comes to your safety, yes. If I call Keith and cancel, he'll think I'm a stupid little girl. Stupid? No. Little girl? Yes. Maybe you can say you're sick? If I miss this show, I might as well be dead. [theme music playing] ♪ Whatever it takes I know I can make it through ♪ ♪ And if I hold out I know I can make it through ♪ ♪ Be the best, be the best The best that I can be ♪ ♪ Whatever it takes ♪ ♪ I know I can make it I know I can make it through ♪ Great week, guys. We passed the budget and approved nine new clubs. - [boy 1] All right. - [boy 2] Nice. [inaudible] You all deserve hugs. [chuckles] But I won't, because someone smells like BO. - I was in a rush this morning. - [Tristan] Right. Let's take 10 minutes before we start Winter Formal interviews. Where does Miles find these harlots? [chuckles] Oh, you mean Esme? - Esme? - [laughs] You and Miles broke up six months ago. You gotta move on. 'Cause there's a lineup of guys just waiting to date me. They're here for interviews. You think that many people wanna plan a dance? He smiled at me. What do I do? Um... ask him out. [bell rings] Show me yours, and I'll show you mine. Excuse me? Ooh! Look at... What? [laughs] Ninety-three? We need to start hanging out. If I tutor you, I won't have enough time to study. Mr. 89 doesn't need a tutor. I meant more like a movie. My friends and I, we're going this weekend. - You should come. - Wow. Uh... Can I let you know? [chuckles] Oh, okay. You do that. Okay. [Lola squeals] - I think I just got asked out. - [Frankie] Don't freak out. I bookmarked 16 fashion blogs for your body type. She can't change herself for a date. Technically, he never said the word "date." - I mean, it could be a hang-out. - As if. You guys always flirt. Tiny flirts with everyone. She's right. What matters is what happens online. Give me your phone. Okay. His last text says, "Did you know there's a species of jellyfish that can live forever?" - What? - Is that code for something? No, he just likes marine biology. Too nerdy. Definite non-date. Why do you guys keep saying, "Gonna armadillo"? Armadillos sleep 19 hours a day. It's... it's our bedtime thing. Aw, you guys have your own goodnight message? - [laughs] I'm dead from cuteness. - Do you do that a lot? Most nights, I guess. He might have real feelings for you. So, it is a date? Tiny's a catch. Why aren't you more excited? Because Shay's not allowed to date until after high school. Oh. Maybe I could take my GED? [Vijay] It's awesome because there's no other way you can beat the dragon and get to the secret checkpoint. My friends were totally thrilled. Do you play any video games? [chuckles] Oh, no. It's not my thing. Oh. Sorry, I'm the worst at this. - It's okay. - It's just... my last relationship ended bad. Like, flaming-car-wreck bad. Except the car, not so flaming. Ugh! As if it isn't hard enough to find a decent gay at school. Ugh! Tell me about it. Sometimes I feel like I'm the problem. [chuckles] No, you're not. You're amazing. And, honestly, Miles is an idiot. Oh, you know about him? I hang out with Hunter. Only a complete doof would let you slip through his fingers. You're smart, funny, a total babe. Not to mention class president. [chuckles] After you asked me out, I broke out into song. I'm an alto, you know. Oh. Choir or musical theater? Obvi. Musical theater puts you in the spotlight. - Can't shine in a uniform. - [laughs] ♪ Everyone wants to feel Like no one can catch them ♪ ♪ Everyone has a plan And no one can request one ♪ Well? Is she gonna show or not? She's right around the corner... [sighs] - [crowd cheering] - ...I hope. Thanks, we're the Wailing Lobsters. [Maya] Guys, I'm here! - Uh, can you get my... Thank you. - Yeah, yeah, I got your amp. We thought you changed your mind. Never! It just took forever for my parents to fall asleep. - But I'm here now, so let's just do this. - Yeah, cool. - Here. - Yeah. You, uh, need a hand with that? Uh, no, I know how to plug in my own gear, thanks. [feedback screeches] Luckily for you, I used to own these pedals. Two quarter-inches next to the XLR... those are the inputs. - [Maya] I know. - She made a mistake, dude. - Back off. - Easy, goth princess. I was just trying to help blondie out. [scoffs] - "Blondie"? - He was just trying to be nice. Yeah, by treating me like an idiot. Can we just focus on the show, please? [Maya sighs] [man on TV] Mr. Spacey allows humanoid robots to adopt... Humanoid robots in the house? - [Mrs. Powers chuckles] - The future is truly terrifying. Shh! You don't wanna upset the one we already got. [Mr. Powers chuckles] Honestly, Shay, when was the last time you slept? This assignment's due tomorrow morning. Train hard, work harder, right? Don't forget play. [man on TV] ...this way they're trained to mature and grow, according to... Uh, speaking of, I read this study that says you pick up the qualities of the people around you. You need new training partners? Actually, uh, my lab partner invited me to a movie, and since my lab partner is super smart, I thought hanging out with my lab partner would make me smarter, right? Someone's working overtime to avoid pronouns. - Is your lab partner a boy? - Aren't we post-gender now? Shaylynn, you know the rules. But all my friends go out with boys. [stammers] Girls who date are more likely to have... sex. - I'm not. - You think that now, but I see girls your age having babies at the hospital all the time. But hanging out with Tiny could mean better grades, which means a school with a better track program. - His name is Tiny? - He's sweet... - [Mrs. Powers sighs] - ...and he is funny, and he's a really, really good influence. If he's such a good influence, I guess we should meet him. Uh, is that necessary? [Mr. Powers] Do you wanna go on this date or not? - [bar patrons talking indistinctly] - I'm Maya Matlin. That's Grace and Jonah. Whoo! Go, Maya! ♪ When it's good You know I'm down ♪ ♪ When I'm feelin' it, I want you around ♪ ♪ You make me smile But then you make me mad ♪ ♪ When I reach out to you And I hear nothing back ♪ ♪ I wanna be the one you wanna be with ♪ ♪ But sometimes I can't believe The things you do ♪ ♪ What's up with you? ♪ ♪ We're not wrong ♪ ♪ We're not right ♪ ♪ Are we cool?

Then I cracked the Kia account!  - ♪ How does it feel? ♪ - ♪ Is it real? ♪ - [man 1 on phone laughing] Maya, focus. - ♪ Don't ever tell me ♪ - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - ♪ What you feel ♪ - It's my first time meeting them too. Yeah. Oh, Bob was there. - He totally killed it.  - ♪ It's not me ♪ - Yeah. Yes.  - ♪ Who's holding back ♪ Can everyone quiet down, please? Okay, are you sitting? Okay, here's the slogan. Well, they bought it in the room. I mean, how could they not? - ♪ Be the one you wanna be with ♪ - Yeah. ♪ But sometimes I can't believe ♪ - ♪ The things you say ♪ - Yes, that's... Yeah! - ♪ And so away ♪ - [laughs] Maya, what're you doing? Would you mind going to the back so everyone else can hear the music? I can stand where I want. Some girl's on her period. [laughs] [scoffs] Hi. Could he call you later? Thanks. You can't stop me from talking on my phone, bitch. [scoffs] Think again. - [man 2] Ooh! - [woman] Thank God! [sighs] [woman cheers] Guess we'll never play that club again. Couldn't Maya contain her crazy till after the first chorus? I need girl talk. Now. I'm kinda in the middle of something. You can eat Grace's muffin later. Did you... break a nail? [chuckles] - No, there's a new man in my life. - Goodnight kiss? Goodnight make-out. And then some. - He reminds me of myself. - That's called narcissism. No, not like that. He's like... me before all the crap. Before Miles. But he hasn't messaged me yet. No "Mr. President, I wanna be your vice." The X-rating is my cue to exit. - Did you check Hastygram DMs? - Of course. - FaceRange? - First place I looked. - E-mail? - Is that a joke? Wait... isn't he in grade ten? [chuckles] OomfChat. [chuckles] [gasps] Here's one from Vijay. Hi, Tris. Last night was F-U-N. Let's do it again sometime, 'kay? What should I say back? Ask him if he's heard of texting? [chuckles] [speaking Mandarin] - I can't introduce Tiny to my parents. - Because he's a drug dealer? Ex-drug dealer. - He got out of that gang. - He's also been stabbed. - That was one time. - That we know of. What if something happens when we're on our date? That's all in the past. Any girl would die to hook up with Tiny. And he chose you. Define "hook up." Is something you will never be asked in this class. - Sorry, Mrs. Lin. - [Mrs. Lin] Don't be sorry. - Especially not in English. - [students giggle] [whispers] Oh, my God. [sighs] Maybe if I replace that guy's phone, Keith'll let us play again. If you apologize for defending yourself, you give guys permission to treat you like crap. Except no one told you to murder a paying customer's phone. Maya gets called a capital B, and everyone's okay with this? [scoffs] Score one for institutionalized misogyny. Ugh! I just wanna play music. To play music, you need to play nice, especially with the men that control the industry. You know why there are so few girl bands? Because no one gives them the chance? Because it's harder for them. On that stage, you need thick skin. Maya can handle it. [scoffs] She broke pretty easy last night. - That jerk deserved it. - Okay, that may be true, but you're the one who jeopardized your gig. You're just a little girl who can't keep her temper in check. "Just a girl." That attitude right there, that's why you can't apologize. Yeah, but what about our big break? What's more important? Your dreams or your pride? You only get one. I once had a student who failed this unit. She just couldn't cut it. [chuckles] You got this. [Shay sighs] [inhales] I can't go to the movie with you. Maybe another time? I have important goals... and I can't have distractions. So I'm a distraction? I just need to keep looking forward. Apparently, so do I. Oh, look, you stabbed him in the heart. May I have it? Please? It's really important. [sighs] Fine, but my tip better be huge. [Miles] Aw, is that for me? What are you doing here? Grabbing a bite. Et toi? Well, it's only right that I be honest with you. I'm... dating someone new. - Golly gee, you're goin' steady, huh? - Is he your soulmate? His name is Vijay. [chuckles] My brother's friend? - Robbing the cradle, huh, Tris? - So you're allowed to date, but I'm not? Who's dating? - We have more of a sibling relationship. - Mmm. - Right, bro? - Sure thing, sis. - [giggles] - [kissing loudly] Vomit. And really creepy. Well, I have a thing for weirdos. Oh! Hey, Miles. - Are you joining us? - Yes, please. Absolutely not. Have fun on your date. Thank you. [sad pop song playing] [breathing heavily] Whoa! What the heck is going on in here? [panting] I'm just doing a little decluttering. Great idea, 'cause you're gonna be spending a lot of time in here. If you don't wanna get caught sneaking out, don't get tagged in photos. No going out, no Zig, no band practice. Fine, because I'm not doing music anymore anyways! [sighs] - What happened? - [Maya sobbing] - I'm not talking about it. - Maya... [sniffles] You know what, Mom? You were right, okay? I'm just some stupid little girl who can't handle anything! I never said that. Even that guy thought so at the club after, like, eight seconds. - What guy? - [sniffling] He said I wasn't good enough, and maybe he's right. [sighs] Who said that? Did somebody hurt you? No, not physically, but... Okay, okay. [Maya sniffles and sighs] Okay, first, you just breathe. Just breathe. Look, if music is your dream... I'll support you. Yesterday you said... I know what I said, and you're still very grounded, but hell if I'm gonna let people tear you down like that. [sniffles] So what do I do? What would you do? Show them how they treated you was not okay. [sniffles] I'll help you fix this. We are going so hardcore. Hunter has us practicing four nights a week. My fingers are so sore, but I honestly think we have a really good chance of getting to nationals. We had our open gaming competition and Gamer Club's public exhibition is next week. - That's nice. - Think you'll make an appearance? [sighs] [softly] Oh, no. Is everything okay? Vijay... you're really great, but, um... I don't think this is gonna work out. You're breaking up with me? [stammers] Is there someone else? No, no, of course not. I mean... Well... maybe. - Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God. - Look, Vijay, don't cry. It's... it's not you, it's me. - You're damn right it's you. - What? We are so cute together. Correction, "were" so cute together, okay? We could've been Degrassi's number one power couple, but instead you're too busy thinking with your ding-dong! - Okay, don't yell. - You don't get to tell me what to do. You're not breaking up with me! I'm breaking up with you! - Vijay, I'm honestly really sorry... - Too late. I've already changed our relationship status. [indistinct chatter] Miles is just messing with you. [Tristan] Yeah, but I'm still not over him. And I can't lead Vijay on because I know how much that sucks. Why does this always happen to me? Pity party for one, your table's now ready. [laughs] If Vijay wasn't enough to get rid of your Miles habit, one of these boys will. Yowza. That guy deserves an ab-salute. [laughs] And if that doesn't work? Nothing wrong with having a little fun in the meantime. Shh! They're coming on. [chuckles] [sniffles and clears throat] Hi, everyone. I'm Maya Matlin. That's Grace, and that's Jonah. Yeah, Grace! Not everyone gets a second chance at this place, so we're lucky that way. I'll take a second chance on you, sweetheart. Did I forget to mention that my mom's sitting right over there? Yeah, I'm sure you didn't mean any harm, but... catcalls like that are not okay. Coincidentally, that's the name of our new song. [pop music playing] ♪ Don't call me babe When you know my name ♪ ♪ You're not the hunter I'm not your game ♪ ♪ This is it You gotta know when to quit ♪ ♪ And you'd better get used to it ♪ ♪ You undress me with your eyes ♪ ♪ You're not a winner I'm not your prize ♪ ♪ This is it Don't you know when to split? ♪ ♪ And I'm gettin' kinda sick Of your sh... ♪ ♪ Don't try to touch me Don't try to run me ♪ ♪ And say that you want me ♪ ♪ Hey, this is not okay ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, I said no way ♪ ♪ You say I gotta chill That's not cool ♪ ♪ Just take care of yourself I'm no fool ♪ ♪ Hey, this is not okay ♪ ♪ Hey, hey, I said no way ♪ ♪ You say I gotta chill Well, guess what? ♪ ♪ Just take care of yourself 'Cause you're messed up ♪ What would we even talk about? I mean, sure, there's the science. - But you can't date science. - [Shay] Exactly. So you're totally over him? There are zero feels? [sighs] Well, we're not well-suited. So you wouldn't be mad if he dated another girl, like, right away? - I guess not.  - I'm so glad you feel that way, 'cause... [sighs] I've been in love with Tiny forever. You never said anything. Because you liked him. - But now that you don't like him... - You wanna go for him. He asked me to a movie. I wanna say yes. Is that okay? You can't imagine how hard it is to see the guy you're into, into someone else. Oh, I've got a pretty good idea. So do I have your blessing? - [tearfully] Go ahead.  - Thanks, Shay. You're the best. That's me... the best. [pop music playing]
