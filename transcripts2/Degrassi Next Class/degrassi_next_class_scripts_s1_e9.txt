 [playing piano] [Frankie] Is this right? Yeah. You're a natural, Mozart. Okay, now take this hand and place it here. Like this? Yeah, that's... that's perfect. [discordant notes] [sighs] This is crazy. Is this crazy? This seems crazy. Was it crazy the last time we kissed?

 I don't know anything about you. What you don't know can't hurt you. - Sorry, what? - [Hunter] I said wake up, dummy. Oh, my... Finally. You sleep like the dead. Get out of my room. Just one question. Who's Jonah?

 ♪ I know I can make it I know I can make it through ♪ It's like there's this hole in my head, and nothing fills it, except... Will I ever stop missing them? - The pills? - The feeling of pills. Like I can... like, handle anything. Getting better's gonna take time. It's a mountain, but not one you climb in a day. - [chuckles] - The first step is to occupy your mind. - Your advice is to get a hobby? - Any friends? Someone you trust? [scoffs] Well, I guess there's Esme. [inhales] The girl that got you hooked in the first place? Must be someone else you can trust. I think I just have to forget it ever happened. And let that jerk get away with it? - Hey! - [gasps] Don't sneak up on me. I'm sorry. That's my fault. No, uh, I'm just jumpy since the swatting. Any update from the cops? The call was made from a burner phone. Honestly, you're the only reason that I've gotten through this. I'm just doing what any good boyfriend would do. Which reminds me... Broods? - You deserve a night out. - I've been dying to see them. - [cell phone vibrating] - Oh... They haven't stopped? "@MayaMatlin I will put you six feet under, you stupid C-word." "@MayaMatlin I'm gonna beat you with a sack of quarters, hashtag, right behind you." What is wrong with people? I'm worried they're gonna attack me for real this time. No, I would never let that happen. That's sweet, but... you're not with me every minute of the day. Well, at least I'm by your side now. I'm sitting here today. But I'm always Maya's partner. Yeah, her loyal partner. [Maya chuckling] Don't worry. I'll survive without you for a period. [speaking Mandarin] [Shay] Um... Um... What's my name? [Shay speaking Mandarin] Right. Okay, Frankie, you're up. What are you looking at? - [gasps] - [Frankie] Nothing. Uh, it's just... dreams. They don't mean anything, right? Dreams mean everything. [Shay] What were you doing in it? Kissing... a person. Okay, this is already way better than your goat dreams. Once. I dreamt about goats once. Are you saying you don't like them anymore? I love them. They're just so darn adorable. So, who were you dream-kissing? Um... - [Shay] Was it Winston? - [sighs] It totally was. You guys are so cute together. - Are we though? - You're like my third fave 'ship after me and Tiny, and Kimmy and Kanye. Yeah, you and Winston are really great together. He's sweet, thoughtful. I guess. I think your brain is trying to tell you that you really like him. Uh, can we just focus on our exam, please? - You're the one dreaming about Winston. - [chuckles softly] [sighs] I'm gonna go study somewhere my boy-crazy friends can't distract me. [scoffs] I can't believe she called you "boy-crazy." [Goldi on PA] If you're a one-line hero, solve this line and you might be worthy of joining our coding club. Flyers with our first coded location will be available at lunch. [Miles] Got you something. Don't flirt with me, Miles. I'm not... Uh, I'm bartering. Yeah, and what must I do for this caffeinated elixir? Can I help with the Snow Ball? [scoffs] The Snow Ball is the shining jewel atop the crown of my presidency. I only have room for the most reliable help. Well, reliable is my mom's maiden name, so I'm at least half-reliable. Yeah, you're not gonna run off with a certain female? I'm on a strict "no Esme" diet. You don't mind doing grunt work? Well, it depends on the kind of grunting. What did I say about flirting? Okay. [sniffles] There are boxes of snow machine equipment all over the council office. They need organizing and stacking. Seriously, Tris. Thanks. [bell ringing] [Mr. Mitchell] We've got lots to review so you can ace your exams. Let's get started. - [Tiny] Yo. - [sighs] Hey, do you know anything about tracking down a troll's IP address from an application program interface? - Uh, I know how to google. - [sighs] I'm trying to track down where Maya's hate-messages are coming from. Any luck? I'll take that as a no. - [sighs] - Uh, why don't you just ask Grace? 'Cause she hates me. Since when? - Oh, man. What'd you do? - [sighs] Okay, look, this is gonna sound bad... because it is, but... I hooked up with Zoë. Oh, gross. - Yeah. - And Grace knows? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. - But she hasn't told Maya. - Are you gonna? - I can't. - No argument there. If she ever finds out, she'll dump your butt. I just wish I could do something to help Maya feel better, you know? [bell ringing] She doesn't deserve this crap. [chuckles] I'm gonna beat you with a sack of quarters, you cockroach. Actually though, you're not gonna win. What? That "sack of quarters" thing. A troll at-replied that to Maya this morning. Why would I camp? I'm not a noob. - Only noobs camp. - Disagree. You think that string bean's trolling her? I don't know. It feels like a stretch. All those nerds talk that way. Yeah, maybe. But if it's him... he won't know what hit him. There isn't much to move, but it's a two-man job. - And then, we'll grab lunch? - Yeah, I have to do something first. Esme. Esme, wait, wait. - Wait, wait. - Leave me alone. What did you do? You wanted me out of your life. - You hurt yourself because of me? - I get a bit... crazy when I'm alone with my thoughts. [Esme sniffles] I shouldn't have ditched you. You wanted to get better. [sobbing] I miss you. Everything was easier when we were together. [continues sobbing] Why don't we grab some lunch? Hmm? Don't you have somewhere to be? [sniffles] No. [speaking Mandarin] You had a sexy dream about Jonah? What? No. You posted his name on your FaceRange. What? No! [scoffs] Do you think he saw it? He has, like, no social media. [sighs] Good. Uh, not good. You know who doesn't have social media? - People with secrets. - You're overreacting. He just doesn't like living online, probably. What if he makes you start smoking? - Jonah doesn't smoke. - How would you know? Because he doesn't taste like a smoker, Shay. Tell me it was just a dream. - [Lola] You kissed him for real? - [Shay] Why didn't you tell us? Was it because you know he's bad for you? No, that's not it at all. - Then are you dating? - I don't think so. - He hasn't DM'd you? - It's only been a couple days. "Days"? So he used your lips and then just threw you away? [Shay] You can't become one of Jonah's girls. He has girls? - Are you sure? - I'm not not sure. Add "hashtag, just saying." [chuckles] [Zig breathing heavily] Hey, that's... that's mine! "@MayaMatlin you deserve all those death threats, hashtag, just saying." - Give it back! - I knew it. Stop trolling Maya! That dumb feminist kills Gamer Club and gets to go on with her happy life? Hell, no. She deserves all of this. [grunting] Hey! - [grunts] - Enough! I said enough! Let's go. [panting] [Goldi on PA] It's not too late to take part in Degrassi's feminist assembly. Sign-up sheets are in the foyer. Hey, do you wanna save us a seat? I'll go grab us some food. So much for staying away from Esme. This isn't like that. It took you a whole five minutes to screw up. She tried to kill herself. She did it because of me. - Miles... - Just... everything I touch gets ruined. [stuttering] And if anything had happened to her... I just can't let her be another victim. Esme was there for me when I was at my worst. She made you the worst. - She needs my help. - You're right. She does need help. But from you, or a doctor? You realize you're getting suspended. And you'll never troll Maya again. - Totally worth it. - [chuckles] I'm not gonna stop. [chuckles] What're you so happy about? You still have my phone? Password's four-four-four-four. Last video. Watch it. [Zig in video] Are you sure? - This is... - You and Zoë. [Zoë in video] Yes. She should know better than to store that stuff on her cloud. You can't show this to Maya. Can't I? She doesn't deserve this. You should've thought of that before you cheated on her. Please. I'm begging you. Here's what's gonna happen. You're not gonna tell Simpson or anyone else. And Maya never sees the video? Everyone wins. Except her. Do we have a deal? [playing piano] Hey, you. I wondered when I'd see you again. [stutters] Could you step away from that piano? Uh, how's... how's this? Have you been with many girls? [scoffs] Like, in the same room? How many girls have you hooked up with? How many girls have you hooked up with? [scoffs] None. Why are you dodging? [sniffles] Frankie... Look, you... you are the only one for me. There are no other girls. Is that what you want? [scoffs] I just wanna know if you're a good person. Ah, well, if I wasn't, it'd be the last thing I'd admit. I can't date someone who keeps secrets from me. Okay, since when are we dating? So you just go around kissing girls like some sort of... serial kisser? - Okay, you kissed me. - You didn't not kiss back. Okay, was I supposed to buy you roses or... Yeah, or you could have called, or texted, or seen me in the halls and said, "Hey, person-I-kissed," like a regular human. What, no comeback? Figures. I've wasted enough time on you, anyway. I've got an exam to cram for. [bell ringing] How are you feeling? I'm kinda stressed about this exam, to be honest. What was Hamlet's deal? You know, my therapist's actually... not the worst. Uh, congratulations. Well, do you want to meet him? Maybe he can help you. I already spoke to my shrink. And he let you come to school? He said I wasn't at risk of further self-harm. Aren't suicide survivors kept for psych assessment for 72 hours? [inhales sharply] The 72-hour rule is a common misconception perpetuated by the mainstream media. Come here. Let go. Let go of me. Let go! Let go! [gasps] - You faked a suicide attempt? - [crying] I had to! You were ignoring me. I can't believe I let Tristan down for this. Why are you always trying to live up to his impossible expectations? - Stay away from me, okay? - Please, I don't have anyone else. You're the only one who ever let me feel normal. Like there wasn't something that needed to be therapied out of me. Don't make this harder. I'm trying to change. You don't need to change for me. Doesn't it feel like everyone wants us to be someone we're not? Sometimes. There's nothing wrong with us. What are you saying? Huh? We should run away. Hunter and I had... a disagreement... and I lost my temper. About? Call of Duty. You got a three-day suspension over a video game? Well, I really wish you hadn't, Zig, because the trolls are... They haven't stopped? If anything, they've doubled down. [Maya] You being here was the only thing that made me feel safe. What if something happens at school? Maya, I am so sorry. Yeah, well... I'm sorry you can't control your temper. I need your help. I'd rather spoon out my eyes. [whispering] Look, Hunter is the troll. So that's why you hamburgered his face. Why didn't you tell Simpson? He's got some dirt on me. The video of you and Zoë. You're letting that twerp torment Maya because you're a disgusting horn dog? Well, just until you hack him and get the video back. Even if I did, Hunter's smart enough to have offline copies. You have to turn him in. He's gonna release the video. I can't put Maya through more crap. [scoffs] Did you see her just now? That girl is having a perpetual meltdown. And if she finds out about Zoë, it's gonna be worse. Who are you really worried about? Maya? Or yourself? - [bell ringing] - [sighs] [speaking Mandarin] Excellent. I can tell you studied. Okay, one more question. - But I already did my ten questions. - This one's a bonus. - [goat bleating] - [chuckling] Oh, my gosh. [Frankie] "Snow Ball?" [stammers] I know goats are your favorite animal. - You guys were in on this? - [bleating] - [chuckles] - [Winston] So what do you say, Franks? - Go to Snow Ball with me? - [bleating] How can you say no to a goat? [chuckles] - [bleating] - [mouthing] I know. Do you want some tea? It's a fancy one my mom bought me to help me de-stress. Uh... no, thanks. I'm sorry. You're sorry? For what? For guilting you over your suspension. I know it's not your job to make me feel better. You've been the perfect boyfriend, and I've been such a mess, I... I haven't even been a decent girlfriend. You're not the bad guy here. I... I know who the trolls are. It's that nerd, Hunter, and... and his friends. - I saw them. - You did? That's what the fight was about. Why didn't you tell me? Never mind. I have to tell my mom. [Maya sighs] Mom, can I talk to you? Uh, does it have to be right now? I almost did drugs today. What do you mean "almost"? [stutters] Well, I really... - really wanted to. - Miles... - did you relapse? - No. [sighs] Okay. Today was supposed to be... a normal... easy day, [shakily] and I couldn't handle it. But you did. [inhales deeply] Mmm. Barely. What happens if next time I don't? I want to change... but I don't think I... I can. You need a fresh start. How is that even possible? We'll figure something out. You made it through today and I'm proud. My mom's on the phone with the cops. [sighs] Thank you so much. Zig, you are my hero. I am not that special. Are you kidding? You're the best. I mean, thanks to you, we can finally get our lives back. We can... we can go to that concert. We can... do other stuff. - [Zig sighs] - [chuckles] I know. I can't believe it's over either, but it is. Thanks to you. Seriously, stop saying that. What's wrong? [sighs heavily] There's something else I need to tell you. [chuckles nervously] You're scaring me. [sighs] Me and Zoë fooled around. It was when you and Jonah were in New York. And it was a stupid mistake, and it meant nothing... and I hate myself for doing it. - Say something. - I think... you should go. We should probably talk about this. Please... Just go.
