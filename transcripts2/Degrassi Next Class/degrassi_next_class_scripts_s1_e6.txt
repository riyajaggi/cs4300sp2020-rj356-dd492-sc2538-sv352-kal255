 - [lasers firing] - [video game character yelps] - [swords clanging] - [dramatic music playing] [Hunter] Come on, come on, faster! - Yael, join me. - [Yael] Okay. [Hunter] All right, this kid's backdooring. - I'm gonna gank her. - Well, hike up your skirt and do it quick. We need you over here. Target annihilated. Let's do this. [Baaz] There in a sec. I'm destroying minions up the left. - Vijay, cover me with a taunt. - [Vijay] Coming up. They're gonna be on us like girls at an H&M; sale.

 [Hunter] All right, let's move in, guys. All right, come on. Baaz, drop your rage. - Rage dropped. - [Hunter] Faster! Come on. We got this. We got this. - Yes! - [all cheering] We did it! We're actually going to Regionals. If I bring home a trophy, my parents will die. Got to admit, you were right about ganking that girl first. One day, you'll learn. Never doubt Hunter Hollingsworth. [Baaz] Um, guys, I hate to burst your well-deserved bubble, but, statistically, we barely won. [Yael] We were down to our last hit points. - Any one of us could have died. - So? We didn't.

 Yeah, but... have you seen the other teams in Regionals? Newman High are beasts. - We can take those guys. - [Baaz] On these laggy machines? I thought mine was gonna freeze entirely. And I heard Northern's playing on Digital Storm GTX 980s. So we give up? We are this close to hanging a banner in the gym and being heroes to this stupid school. Thanks for coming. [Baaz] Okay, but on these CPUs, in a game of millimeters, we're miles away. No, I refuse to accept defeat before battle. I'll get us new computers. How? I told you... never doubt Hunter Hollingsworth. [theme music playing] ♪ Whatever it takes I know I can make it through ♪ ♪ And if I hold out I know I can make it through ♪ ♪ Be the best, be the best The best that I can be ♪ ♪ Whatever it takes ♪ ♪ I know I can make it I know I can make it through ♪ [laughs] _ [chuckles] Skipped breakfast too, huh? Let's hit the caf before class. One benefit of CF, my body needs all the fat it can get. [chuckles] [laughing] That much? Stop. [both giggling] Okay, if I'm gonna be your chauffeur, the least you can do is talk to me. Who raised you to be so rude? Maybe I got it from my dad. _ - Ugh! - [laughs] Can I talk to you for a second? Sorry. I know you hate it when I mention my father... - Whoever he is. - That's not it. - That girl has a crush on you. - [Zoë scoffs] That's why you're being all pissy? She's not the kind of person you should be hanging out with. What kind? You don't want people to think you're gay. Would that be the worst thing in the world? You have other friends, Zoë. I'd rather you hang out with them, okay? [chuckling] [sighs] [Jonah] Come volunteer at New Lane Teen Addiction Center. [grunts] Can I help you? Spoiler alert, life is meaningless. Tell me about it. - But it doesn't have to be. - [sighs] Oh, yeah? You've found a way to make my existence less pointless? [inhales] Well, no, not yours. - You're kind of a lost cause. - [chuckles] But you could help other people find their way. I run pro-social activities at a teen addiction center. I'm not even an amateur social right now. I'd rather be alone. Yep, makes sense. What does that mean? You're one of those girls who's too spoiled to care about anybody else. - You don't know me. - I can guess. Good grades, mostly due to tutors. You have never heard the phrase, "We can't afford that," and your biggest problem is some guy, who's barely good enough for you, dumped you and now you feel "lost." So, what you're saying is, I'm your type. [laughs] Look, these kids, they have real problems. Addiction, poverty, rough home lives... - Come volunteer. - What would I have to do? Well, this week we're playing Woods War. - Do you have any tennis balls? - Only, like, five dozen. [chuckles] I practically grew up on the courts. - Yeah, I was gonna guess that, too. - [chuckles] Sound good? We don't even need any money. It's just a one-time donation of technology. That's very generous of you, sir, but in order for our gaming team to be competitive, we would need new computers. [stammering] But you just have them lying around! I mean... [shouts] Crap! [panting] Would you delinquents just move along to skipping class and leave me alone? - Hey, nothing's that serious. - What would you know? If I don't get that tech, then we don't go to Nationals, and Baaz, Vijay, and Yael are pissed. Um, where's Nationals? Vancouver. Which means hotels. Oh, you dog. You're hoping to get some. What? No, no, no. It's just about video games. Just... shut up and let me think. - [sighing] - Why not just ask Dad for the money? [scoffs] Like he'd support my little games. Maybe if it was basketball... People would actually pay to watch because, you know, it's a sport. [giggles] Hey, loads of people watch our livestreams. We have fans. Really? Are they here? Please, ladies, give him some space. Hey, you want an autograph? That'll be five bucks. - No, ten bucks. - [both chuckle] You know, contrary to popular belief, you're not a total waste of space. [both chuckle] [cell phone vibrating] Yeah, Yael, um... do you still have that cosplay costume in your locker? I think I know a way we're gonna get that money. [chuckles] [Tristan] Fighting with your mom again? The Gilmore Girls binge is a dead giveaway, hon. Oh, spoiler alert. Jess swoops back in and Rory totally kisses him. My mom forbade me from hanging out with Grace. Oh, my God. Did she figure it out? She thinks Grace likes me. But it's not Grace she's worried about. It's okay. My parents knew I was gay before I did, it's... kinda sweet. Except your parents aren't strict Roman Catholics who'd disown you. But you're not gonna stop talking to your crush, though. I just wish I could find my dad and ask him what he thinks. Okay, David Sutcliffe played a cool TV dad, but... you don't still think he's, like... My mom was an extra on Gilmore Girls. What? He acts. I act. It's possible. Look at our noses. He's in town shooting a movie. And you're gonna go all Maury on his ass and request a paternity test? I'll see you in class. [sighs] [Grace] I'll go. I have got to get a better hiding spot. - What'd you hear? - All about your celebri-dad. And you think I should be medicated? I think we should go ask him. "We"? If this is why you've been acting so weird, then, yeah. I miss my friend. [chuckles] [video game theme music playing] Do you love Degrassi Panthers' Gaming Team? Then donate to our crowdfunding campaign. Your donation will help support the destruction of our enemies. Rest in pieces, ladies. [Hunter] Help us level-up our tech. [Yael] Let's take this to the next level. And guarantee yourself access to all our exclusive trick-shot vids. Oops, dropped your purse. [Hunter] With $5,000, we can dominate Regionals and bring a National championship... [all] to the Kingdom of Degrassi. Great. I look great in that. For what we paid to make it, it has incredible production value. It didn't cost us anything. Yael? I like it. It's really cool. [chuckles] But? What if people think it's stupid? People who think that wouldn't give us any money anyway. Okay, look. Even if everyone mocks us, and we make no money... I have to know we did everything we could to win. [Hunter sighs] Posted. [student on PA] For anyone interested in volunteer opportunities, we now have a community service board in the foyer... They should have to do that off of school property. Do you think I'm spoiled? Sorry, Shay Powers is not available. Please leave a message. [imitates beeping] Well, not anymore. I'm thinking of volunteering. Want to come? Cancel your plans tonight, amiguitas. We're hitting the town. - I can't. - You have to. I've been talking to Tiny for two weeks and we haven't hung out as a group. And I'm not going to become one of those girls. I promised Jonah I'd volunteer with him. The guy whose hairstyle is "needs a bath"? Ew, no. I signed up. - I can't bail. - Fine. Then it'll just be me, Tiny, and Shay. Fun little threesome. You can't ditch me. Well, I'm serious about helping people. Then help me not be alone with the guy I like and our friend, who makes out with him all over the school. You're not gonna change the world in a day. [bell ringing] [Baaz] Vijay, once you finish juggling, you have to race back to join us, or we'll all get destroyed like this. 100% more Barry Allen. Got it. Is it even possible to move like the Flash on these laggy machines? Hunter, you called this practice. We might not need it anymore. [gasping] We can get the new gear. In roughly four days by my count. We need to get back to work, um... We need to research the new gear... Can we help you? Have you heard what people are saying about you guys? For the last time, if people are making fun of us, we don't care. Yeah, they're not making fun. They're saying your video and your club is misogynist and that it celebrates sexualized violence. Anyways, there's an emergency meeting in student council after school. This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Don't shoot the messenger. [scoffs] Then who do I shoot? [faint hammering] There's his trailer. [faint indistinct chatter] [sighs] So, what's the plan? I... didn't think we'd get this far. What if he comes back? You're right. We should go. Whoa. We should find some hair. We can do a DNA test or whatever. - What if it's not a match? - Then you'll know. And what if it is a match, but he just doesn't want me or never did? [scoffs] Then you'll know. Why are you freaking out all of a sudden? I'm not ready for this. Would you really rather live a lie than know the truth? [sighs] Okay, let's find some hair and go. - Coat. - Check the collar. [Grace chuckles] Underwear. - Large. - Gross. That's my dad's... maybe. [door knob rattles] What the hell's going on here? Nothing. We can explain. All right, I'm calling security. You two, sit down and stay put. Sit down! - [gavel pounding] - [Tristan] Sit down! Sit down! One at a time. We're here to discuss the future of Gamer Club, not snipe at each other. Maya, the Feminist Club still has the floor. As I was saying, when Hunter and his friends play their games, they say a lot of really sexist stuff. So you've been spying on us? - [scoffs] - You play in the gym. We wouldn't say anything offensive in there. [Maya] "Hike up your skirt"? Referring to the victims only as "ladies"? - Fine, we'll stop. Can I go? - [Goldi] That's not all. Your game also hypersexualizes women. And the men are shown as powerful... - and notably clothed. - [Hunter scoffs] Those aren't even humans. Those are, like, animals and plants, and robots and stuff. Yeah, with tons of cleave. And how is that any different from a cheerleading uniform? [Goldi] They're regularly attacked. It's potentially harmful to any woman who's experienced violence. You do know we have a football team, right? And those guys are actually trying to hurt each other. Your game normalizes male violence against women. Imagine how that feels to a sexual assault survivor. - Well, they don't have to watch. - But it's in their halls. The school can't continue to sanction this potentially triggering activity. [scoffs] "Triggering"? Then let's ban everything that triggers anyone's fear, right? Like... like blonde hair, which triggers my fear of populars mocking me for whatever fashion faux pas I've made. Or, like, your meathead boy toy, who I am afraid will punch me if I make eye contact with him in gym. - Or like your headgear... - [girl gasps] triggering my fear that you'll snap and blow us all up. Okay, everything is a trigger! Everyone's scared! That's high school! This whole thing is stupid. [David] No, I'm telling you, they were just in here. Yeah, I can wait. This is all a misunderstanding. Gilmore Girls goes up on Netflix, and it's like a whole new generation of you stalker fangirls. [scoffs] I don't even know who you are. You're holding my underwear. Because I'm your daughter. - What? - My mom was an extra on the show and she always hinted that maybe something happened. That's ridiculous. We need the underwear to know for sure, unless you'll give us blood? No one's getting my blood. Look... I'm sorry, but I'm not your dad. There's no way. I don't mix business with pleasure, and I was never into sleeping with extras. I'm really sorry we bothered you. Whatever. Forget it. Just... just go. Gladly. Are you gonna be okay? I... don't know. My mom doesn't want me to be like this, so... - A girl who breaks into trailers? - A girl who likes girls. Sorry, not your problem. I just thought that if you were my dad, I could... come live with you and everything would be okay. It will be. So... I can come live with you? No. But you should stop caring what your mom says. - You can't live a lie for her. - Even if the truth makes her hate me? Look, I know this is gonna sound like fatherly advice from some teen show, but it also happens to be true. It's your life, not hers. And you can only ever make yourself happy. Hey, do you think I could call you sometime? Absolutely not. - What in God's name is that? - [Frankie] A praline. You're eating pralines and cream. It's not just a clever name. - Didn't you order cookies and cream? - I don't wanna make a fuss. [Tiny] My girl paid for cookies, - my girl's getting cookies. - [Lola chuckles] - This is torture. - Then let's leave. What are we doing here, anyway? Eating sundaes? [scoffs] This is childish. I should already be volunteering. But if we go, they'll know I have a problem with their relationship. You do have a problem with their relationship. Okay, I don't want Lo to know that. No, you know what? You chose not to go out with him. You're not allowed to be upset about it. Says the girl who's chosen to be upset about Winston for the past month. We were there for you. Changed my mind and got SuperKid. Look, rainbows. [chuckles softly] [huffing angrily] - What are you doing? - [breathing heavily] They shut us down. We aren't fit to represent the school, so who cares? We don't need this junk. [scoffing] That's it then? You're just giving up? They're allowed to say whatever they want to say about us, but as soon as I say anything back, I'm the monster. Well, they're idiots! [panting] You don't hate me? I heard what you said. That was... dumb stuff, sure. But I know you're not racist... or sexist. I mean, you're my best friend. All I wanted to do was win the championship with you guys. Then stop smashing things, and find a way to fix this. [Yael sighs] [exhales deeply] So, what are we playing? "Were" playing. Don't tell me I missed it. Okay, how about I tell you that you ruined it? Whoa, I'm just a little late. Two full hours. And you failed to bring the tennis balls, so we had to switch games at the last minute and play capture the flag... for the billionth time. I'm sorry. I had to do something first. You're not on FaceRange. I didn't know how to get a hold of you. Frankie... these kids need somebody who's not gonna let them down. And you're late because... Let me guess. You had a fashion emergency? Bestie drama? I wanted to be here. Not with my stupid friends. And yet, you weren't. [scoffs] I can do better. I doubt it. I think you're just addicted to the drama of being miserable. And you know, everybody who comes here... they are actually trying to change. Everybody but you. [Frankie sighs] [sighs] On the bright side, you've ruled him out. One down, three-and-a-half billion to go. - You think this is a joke? - I'm trying to cheer you up. I have no one. No dad, an awful mother. [sighs] Your mom's not that bad. [sighs] She said I can't hang out with you. [scoffs] I'm all alone in this world. [scoffs] No, you're not. Oh, really? Who do I have? Me, dummy. [giggles] The girl who just broke into a TV star's trailer for you. [chuckles] [groans softly] Oh, I'm sorry. I should go. Uh, Winston... why are you even here? Well, I was crazy enough to think that Miles was actually going to meet me to finish our history project. That guy never comes home anymore. I think he's on drugs. [chuckles] I think he's on an entire pharmacy. - What's wrong, Franks? - This isn't your job anymore. I know, but... you're sad... and I'm here. I just... I don't... [sighs] I don't know who to be. My friends don't want me to change, but I don't feel the same, you know? Everything was simpler last year. It was so much easier to... be happy. I just wish we could go back. I wish we could, too. [Tristan] Both Simpson and the PTA approached me. [Goldi] That's what I was thinking about the whole thing. I didn't want it to be a thing. - [Tristan] No, of course. - Yeah. Please, don't shut us down just because I said some things the wrong way. And what, pray tell, was the right way to stereotype my entire religion? I was trying to make a point about irrational fear. I think it's dumb that people think that. Okay, I've got solutions, all right? We'll ditch the headsets. No more trash talk. And we just won't use the female characters at all. So there's gonna be no female representation? - What? There's a girl on the team. - [Tristan] Just one. And on the other teams, I've seen pretty much none. It's not my fault that guys are better than girls at video games. - Oh, wow. - Okay, that's not what I'm... [sighs] Guys grow up playing video games, okay? I don't know why. But by now, they're better at it. It's just reality, okay? I'm trying. - How about you try a different video game? - No! I thought we were talking solutions. What about Wii bowling? Oh, my God. You don't get it, do you? This is the game. Like at Nationals, like in the pros. - I didn't design it. I just play it. - Okay, the PTA already heard about the meeting, and Simpson, too, and they've asked for the club to be shut down. That's bull! When you were elected, you said you'd fight for us. Well, I have to pick my battles, and you made this one too hard to win. [scoffs] [bell ringing] I just need to grab my... - We all heard that. - Yeah? Well, I failed again, so... But you fought for us. No one ever fights for us. And now it's clear those social justice warriors don't even know what they're talking about. So you guys aren't mad? Regionals may be kaput, but... we'll still follow you into any battle. Any battle? Because I think I might know our next one. [Yael] Really? What? Revenge. [dramatic music playing] [upbeat music playing]
