 Hey, you looked great up there. Are we really doing this? You're really gonna act like everything's normal? Maya, we need to talk. You cheated on me, Zig, and then lied about it for weeks. [stammering] I know... and I'm so sorry. Have you guys seen Jonah? Okay, never mind. I'll keep looking. I thought that we were over. Please don't let us be over. Why should I forgive you? I wish I could take back the moment that Zoë kissed me, but... It was just a kiss? Yeah, basically.

 Okay, we can talk... after the dance. What's up, mega-grin? I think everything's gonna be okay. Yeah, right. - [alarm blaring] - [music stops] What's going on? [Simpson over PA] This is a lockdown. Please follow protocol. ♪ Whatever it takes I know I can make it through ♪ ♪ And if I hold out I know I can make it through ♪ ♪ Be the best, be the best The best that I can be ♪ ♪ Whatever it takes ♪ ♪ I know I can make it I know I can make it through ♪ _ [Mr. Armstrong] Five more minutes. Hey, any plans for the break? Staying far away from this torture chamber as possible. See you in the Voodoo Lands. Do you, um, maybe wanna go to the Snow Ball with me tonight? To watch hormone-laden adolescents grope each other in the gymnasium? [scoffs] Never mind. Stupid idea. I'm in. - Great. I'll buy tickets. - And, uh, get me a corsage, too. Yeah, of course. Hunter, Yael, please follow me. [whispering] Maybe we're getting nominated for an award. Obviously, the school found out that we trolled Maya. Even if they suspect us, they have zero proof. - So what do we do? - Deny everything. Winston wants to know the color of my dress. So he can buy you a corsage. Sweet. I don't even know what I'm wearing. The semi-formal's tonight. Yeah, I was just gonna throw something on. - You will not. - Lo, breathe. If all goes well, you and Winston will get back together. - Uh, that's not a sure thing. - Not if you just throw something on. You need to convince Winston that you two are perfect together. Well, what if we're not? Come on... we all agree that you were way better when you two were together. He's smart, nice... easy on the eyes. What else could a girl want? [Jonah clears throat] It looks like someone finally got her flowers. [sighs] Look, I'd love to trade witty one-liners with you, but I have to go get a dress for a date... that isn't you. Right. [sighs] [Tristan scoffs] You need these anti-oxidants more than I do. Just looking at that smoothie makes me want to hurl. Hey, if you're sick, stay away, 'cause I can't miss my big event tonight. [sighs] People are saying that the Snow Ball will be memorable. No thanks to you. How many tickets? I can't come. Big events are triggers. Then why are you here? I'm going to boarding school next semester. Mom and I decided that I need a fresh start, to get away from all the bad influences. So, uh... goodbye, I guess. And... [inhales] I'm sorry. For what? [chuckles] Take your pick. [Tristan sighs] [Maya] Then there was the swatting. When I saw those guns, I thought someone was coming in to kill me... and I've never been so scared in my life. [crying] I'm sorry... That you overreacted. I'm sure whoever was responsible thought it was some sort of joke. Mrs. Matlin says Maya wakes up every night screaming, "Don't hurt me." - Mr. Simpson... - That's not a joke. Now, the Matlins won't press charges if those persons responsible for the trolling come forward. The swatting, obviously, is up to the police. So I ask you, are any of you responsible? Yes. I'm so, so, so sorry. [Baaz] We didn't mean to hurt anyone. Um, also, any chance we can keep this from my parents? Didn't think so. [Simpson] Hunter, anything to add? You deserve what you got. Maya, you can go. [Maya sighs] Hey... how'd that go? Have you seen Mom? I need to go shopping for the Snow Ball. You have, like, three closets full of clothes. None of them feel right. [Winston] You'll look great in anything. Winston, you're here. [sighs] Oh, no. I lost track of time. Well, you're worth waiting for. Plus, this might help you pick a dress. Silver goes with everything, right? You didn't need to buy this, especially after the flowers. What flowers? Oh. Um... never mind. You like it, don't you? It's beautiful. But I can't take it. And I can't go to the Snow Ball with you. Who is he? If... if you're ditching me on the night of the dance, it's... it's for another guy. It's not like that. Besides, I don't even know if it is something. Whoever it is, wish him luck. With you, he'll need it. You guys ruined everything. We tortured that poor girl enough. And now we're the ones getting tortured. I think we got off easy. Thirty hours of in-school community service, which we start at the dance. I'm running the photo booth. Yeah, but who knows what's gonna happen to me because of the swatting? So Maya should live in fear every day? Is that what you think? This isn't about her. This is about correcting a social injustice. Answer the question. Get out of my face. Not until I find out if my best friend is a sociopath. - Get away! - [Yael gasps] - I'm sorry. - You need to go. Now! And then we could end with "Not Okay." Well, you're the boss, but typically, the last song at a dance is slow. Then we'll do a cover. How about "Yes"? The one you wrote about how much you love Zig. No! You knew. - I told him to tell you. - You could've told me. I tried, but with the trolling, it never seemed like the right time and... I am so sick of excuses. Just leave. We don't need you to play with us tonight. [sighs] [exhales] Go ahead. Say something. I have no clue what just happened. Your sister's a piece of work. Well, on the bright side, you get to spend the night with a better-looking Hollingsworth. And I guarantee the only drama - will be at the movies. - [Hunter] You can't do this! - Where is my gaming rig? - [scoffs] It's been confiscated. - [Hunter groans] - Oh, your laptop, too. - Whoa, what's going on? - She took my computers! You attacked an innocent girl. - You're Maya's troll? - It was a political statement. And hand over your phone. No, no, no. Not until I deal with the Yael situation. She hates me. Whatever. I'll cancel your line. [breathing heavily] [pottery shatters] Okay, buddy, you need to calm down. Shut up! I need to think! You're overreacting, okay? Stop telling me what to do! [mirror shattering] [clattering] [panting] [breathing heavily] Yay! You're finally here. Okay, let's take a pic. Um... okay, it'll do. [sighs] I need to find someone first. Aw! Do you and Winston have a secret romantic rendezvous planned? He's not coming. I told him I didn't like him that way anymore. So you called it off the night of the dance? I thought you wanted to be happy. Winston doesn't make me happy. - But I think Jonah might. - [Lola] Okay, I know you're going through some crazy mid-high school life crisis, but Jonah Haak is not the answer. He'll break your heart, and we'll be left to pick up the pieces, again. Because you're the relationship experts? You're dating her crush. - Frankie! - You said you were over Tiny! How could I be? I liked him for forever, and he liked me back until you wiggled your big butt at him. [gasps] At least I have one. Are you girls gonna take your pic, or what? Say cheese. [shutter clicking] - [knocking on door] - [Miles] Hunter? Obviously, he's not in a social mood. I wanna make sure he's okay before we go to the movies. [knocking on door] - [Winston] Hunter? - [knocks on door] Hey, Hunter. [Winston sighs] He's not in the bathroom. Where is he? [Winston] Oh, crap. - It's not a... - Kill list? We should call 911. No. No, there's no way... [Winston] Tristan's name is on it. But you're probably right. I mean, where would he even get a gun? My dad keeps his downstairs. ["Not Okay" playing] ♪ Don't call me babe When you know my name ♪ ♪ You're not the hunter I'm not your game ♪ ♪ This is it You gotta know when to quit ♪ ♪ And you'd better get used to it ♪ ♪ You undress me with your eyes ♪ - We're all out of soda. - There's more in student council. ♪ This is it Don't you know when to split? ♪ [gasps] You shouldn't be here. This morning wasn't my fault. It's this stupid school. They don't understand people like us. - I'm not like you, Hunter. - Yes, you are. I know you are. - Let go. - You're the only one who understands me. You're my best friend. - Just come outside. - No. I thought you were different. You're just like everyone else. ♪ You say I gotta chill Well, guess what? ♪ ♪ Just take care of yourself 'Cause you're messed up ♪ [cheering] Thank you, everyone. We'll be back in 20 with another set. [dance music playing] Maya, we need to talk. Zig, you cheated on me and then lied about it for weeks. I know and I'm so sorry. Have you guys seen Jonah? Okay, never mind. I'll keep looking. [sighs] [Maya] We can talk, after the dance. What's up, mega-grin? I think everything's gonna be okay. Yeah, right. - [alarm blaring] - [music stops] - [beeping on PA] - What's going on? [Simpson over PA] This a lockdown. Please follow protocol. Move away from sight. Lock doors. Turn off the lights. Maintain silence. Wait for first responders to arrive. I repeat, this is a lockdown. Please follow protocol. - Move away from sight. - [beeping continues] Okay, everyone. Come out of the gym. Just follow me. I'm gonna take you through the council office. [Simpson on PA] Wait for first responders to arrive. Hey, guys, come in here. You guys know what to do. Line up on the floor. Come on. You guys know what to do. Thank you. We should be safe here. - [Tristan sighs] - [phone chimes] _ _ _ _ _ _ - [door unlocks] - _ [footsteps approaching] [Maya sighs] I... locked the door. Is there anything else I should do? Thank you. You've done enough. Sorry. You're the worst. You know that, right? I can't believe Grace was ever your friend. I think I took care of that. Why Zig? He was there. He was easy. What do you mean "easy"? Well, he didn't exactly say no. [clears throat] So... he kissed you back, then what? - Doesn't matter. - You don't get to decide what matters. Why won't you tell me? Because I don't want to see the look on your face when I do. [banging] Does that sound like a gunshot? Relax. It's probably another false alarm. Yeah, like I'll ever believe you again. [Frankie sniffles] Don't worry. It'll be okay. [Frankie] No, it won't. I found Jonah with another girl. I should've listened to you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry you have to be sorry. And I'm sorry for... No, I think I'm good. [sighs] Fine. I'm sorry for dating Tiny when I knew it was too soon. And... I'm sorry that we pressured you into coming to the dance with Winston. We thought he'd make you happy. I wish he did. I'm sick of being sad. Since we're being honest... - we're sick of it, too. - Lola! [Lola] What? All year, it's been poor little Frankie. And nothing makes her happy, especially not us. I never said that! Did I? Okay, well, I didn't mean it. I'm sorry... again. [sighs] Can we hug now? [sniffles] You are so lucky Maya forgave me. - Otherwise, you'd be dead. - Zigmund... now is not the time to be uttering death threats. Whatever. This kid's a psycho. [phone vibrates] Hello? [Miles] Hey, could you put Hunter on? It's Miles. [Hunter] Hello? Hey, I heard, uh, there's a lockdown. I just wanted to make sure you're okay. [breathing deeply] Are you okay? Yeah, sure... Listen, I know the last few days have been tough, but you're not alone, okay? No matter what, you'll always have me. I love you. I know I don't always show it, but I do. I love you. [footsteps approaching] [Goldi] I hear footsteps. - [door opens] - [indistinct radio chatter] [officer] The school is clear. - Seems like it was just a prank. - [Zig] Like a swatting? [officer] Yeah. You can all come out now. Okay, so the police have swept the school and they suspect it's another swatting. So, Simpson says we can get this party started again. Uh, Goldi, can you find Maya and her band? Uh, Yael, get the bevvies flowing. And, um... Sorry, guys, I'll be right back. Hi. I'm sorry for being a drama queen. Dad's gun was missing. So you called in the lockdown? I was worried that Hunter would do something crazy. But my dad probably just took the gun with him when he moved out. Well, you predicted tonight would be memorable. [inhales sharply] I should check on Hunter. He didn't hurt anyone tonight, but I know he's hurting. Take care, Tris. Come on. Let's go home. [Zig] Maya, you're okay. I was so worried... I can't talk now. I told Tristan I'd DJ. - Well, let me help. - Did you like it? When you and Zoë fooled around, did you like it? [stammers] Maya, I'm sorry. So what? Don't ever lie to me again. [sighing] Don't worry, it'll get better. May I have the pleasure of this dance? Apparently not tonight. Hey. Uh, where's your date? Where's yours? [sighs] Okay, Frankie, did I do something wrong? You bought me flowers, and then I find you canoodling with some other girl. You said you were coming with someone else. Because you didn't ask. I thought you understood me. Well, I don't... at all. But I would really like to, so can you please just quit it with these games? Okay, hold up. I am not the one who's playing games. I'm not either. I like you, Frankie Hollingsworth. I like you, Jonah Haak. Then let's dance. Get out. Just... [breath trembling] put it down. Were you really gonna hurt those people? [voice breaking] I don't... I don't know. [whispers] I don't know. [sobbing] You can't tell anyone. [somber music plays]
