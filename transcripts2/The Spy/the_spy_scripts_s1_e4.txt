 This is George Seif, Radio Damascus. Our army fought back and won against the unprovoked Israeli attack last night at the town of Nukieb in the Golan Heights. We are hearing reports of many Israeli casualties, in a battle that was won by our brave soldiers. For Syria! For Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria! Kamel Amin Thaabeth.

 I do not know if you remember me from Buenos Aires. Ahmed Suidani. Of course, uh... General Al-Hafez's Chief of Security. So you made it to Damascus after all? I'm sorry, I have to, uh... So good to see you on this glorious day. Yeah, yeah, Syria! Yeah, yeah, Syria! ...nuclear weapons... Everything you say, it's a bullshit, Ma'azi. I was there. Nukieb is burnt to a crisp.

 Many died. Many on our side. - Coffee? - Sure. You don't know what you are talking about. I was listening to the radio all morning. Propaganda. All of it. George Seif at his best. We lost the damn battle. I was at the square. I saw the dead soldiers on the burnt tanks. Those are dead Syrian soldiers dressed in Israeli uniforms. I know I joke around about many things, but not about dead soldiers. The Israeli were extra brutal this time. They killed dozens. Now, if only we were as good in battle as we are at spreading lies. Oh, shut up, Ma'azi. Shut up. You don't know what you are saying. Al-Ard, uh, George Seif reads what they tell him to read. My uncle spent hours on the phone with Al-Kudsi trying to explain how we managed to lose so badly even though it was a surprise attack. Our surprise attack! If you weren't the nephew of the commander-in-chief, you'd be in jail by now. Besides which, I don't wanna hear it, even if it's true. If? How long have we been friends for, Kamel? Two years. Have I ever lied to you? Many times. Fuck you. If you don't believe me, I'll take you there. Take me where? The border. You can't take him. It's a restricted military zone. No civilian has ever been there. You can't take me. I can take you there. I can. It is not dangerous? I heard the Jews have sharpshooters. The only Jew that will kill you... is your wife. That is true. So? I know the risks involved, but isn't this our dream come true? - Isn't this what we always wanted? - His job is to watch, listen and report. Be our eyes and ears. He's not to be noticed, Maya. Noticeable spies end up dead. Ma'azi Ad-Din has access and connections. He can get whoever he wants in. This is a rare opportunity. Eli was smart to befriend him. If he did go... Shallal, that would be the number one priority. We still don't know what their secret project underground is. Can you imagine the treasure trove of information he can bring from a visit to the most closely guarded area in the region? But if you think it's too dangerous, don't send him in. He's your man. It's your decision. - Hi. - Hi. - Sophie, be a good girl. - Hi, Sophie. - Thanks for watching her. - You're welcome. I'm so late. - Say goodbye to Mom. - I love you, baby. Say goodbye to Mom. Oh! No, no! No, wait! Wait! Oh! Thank you. We're late again, Iris. Please stop crying. You've made your point. You'll get sick like that. I'm sorry I'm late. For the fourth time this week. I can stay late. I'll finish the work. Nadia, I'm worried about you. I'm just a little tired. That's all. You've been crying. You have dark circles under your eyes. You're not sleeping. I can't make her stop crying. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. You're not doing anything wrong. You're just doing it alone. You need help. Eli's mother takes Sophie all the time. His family helps a lot, really. You didn't make these babies alone, and you shouldn't raise them on your own. - Tova, I know you're trying to help... - When's the last time you saw Eli? Eleven months ago. He was here for a few weeks and had to go back to Europe. He never even saw the baby. He's making a big sacrifice for our future and... I can't be ungrateful. Yes, you can. Nadia, I want you to go home. I'm not firing you. I'm sending you home to rest. Instead of falling asleep here in front of my fan, sleep in your bed. Oh... I was expecting something less conspicuous, like a Jeep or something. - This is so, uh... - Amazingly cool? I know. ...ridiculous. Yalla. Ooh-ah! Yalla. Wait, wait, wait. Stop the car. Stop the car! Lake Tiberias. In all its glory. And there is Israel. So close. The most fertile soil ever. Beautiful lakes, mountains, waterfalls, landmines. Our country is the most beautiful in all the world. Mm. I'll take your word for it. You know, I... I never really left Syria. - Oh. - Well, once. Been to Beirut for a few days, but, uh... - you've been to the Alps... - Mm. ...to South America, to Paris! All of them together, Ma'azi, don't come close to the majesty of this land. If you say so. What's that? Oh. New deal with the Soviets. Khrushchev is supplying us with a lot more than he's admitting to the world. And they are... They are 120-millimeter mortars. Not even the Israeli have those. Good for us. Are you coming? Of course. Yalla. These are the soldiers from the Nukieb battle. They have lost more than half their men. They bombed from the air when most men were asleep. They died in their beds. They didn't even give them the chance to die like heroes. The injured... We couldn't get to them, 'cause Israeli tanks arrived and mowed everything down, and shot at everything moving. They turned Nukieb into one big graveyard. Hey. Ma'azi. I heard you were in my sector. And I heard about your visitor. Kamel Amin Thaabeth, meet Sheriff Hatoum. Sorry, Colonel Hatoum. Mr. Thaabeth. Please, call me Kamel. Forgive me, but we don't get many Syrian visitors here, Mr. Thaabeth. Ma'azi might think that this is a museum, but in fact, it's a closed military zone. - I spoke to my uncle about it... - Yes, yes. - I know. - If my presence is in any way a problem... - Marouane! - ...I will... I'm assuming you're telling Mr. Thaabeth about our victories here. How, despite the violent attack on us, we managed to get three tanks and kill some of the occupiers. Yes, I was getting to that. Mr. Thaabeth, join me in my car. I'll give you the right kind of tour. - Thank you. - Ma'azi, your uncle is coming tonight. I'm meeting him for dinner at Honitvah. Wh... I didn't know he was coming. I'm relieved to hear your uncle doesn't share all state secrets with you. The advantage we have is one of unpredictability and height. From here, we do our surveillance, and, when needed, we can respond with force. Looking for something? Well, yes. Where are our soldiers? Our bases? Now, this is brilliant. Come on, I'll show you. You wanted to meet the brave soldiers, here they are. We have the entire area covered in bunkers like this. The Zionists can't see them from the sea or sky. This is unbelievable, absolutely incredible. So, tell me, what are we looking at here? The Ein Gev kibbutz. Fishermen, mostly. The Zionists like to play victim. As if we are shooting indiscriminately. But they are stealing our land and fishing in our water, despite international agreements. Mm. So you can see them up close and personal. Thank you. The enemy. They look like us. What did you think they'd look like? Octopus? Would you like to shoot one? Please, my present to you. Retaliation for Nukieb. Are you serious? Please. I'm not a soldier, I'm sorry. It's easy. You point... and you squeeze the trigger. Is there a problem? On the contrary. Don't be confused. They might wear civilian clothes, but each one of them is a Zionist soldier. Even the young ones. Simply choose a target. Put your finger on the trigger... and now, when you're ready... Step away from the rifle. What are you trying to do, start a war? That was a good one. Oh! Colonel, this heat, it's torture. How come our soldiers don't have any shade? Surely they deserve the best conditions? You're right, Kamel, but our government has limited funds, and sometimes, far from the capital also means far from the heart. Yes. You're gonna love it. This is the best food in all of Syria. Looks delicious. - Shukran. - Shukran. Brought in especially for Colonel Hatoum. I guess it's the advantage of being the commander of the sector. Leave them here. We'll get them ready for the Colonel. - Here. - Thank you. I should've called one of Eli's brothers, but I'm... quickly running out of favors. It's okay, I, uh... I'm glad you called. It's been a very long time. I'm sorry I didn't, uh, reach out myself. I... I wanted to... to make sure you're okay. I'm a mess. Sorry, I don't mean to burden you with all this. It's okay, I... I... I was just running a few errands. How about you join me? Shouldn't take too long, then maybe we can eat. It will make you feel better. Yeah. This is the best-kept secret in the Golan Heights. A vestige of the Roman Empire. A place where their senators would come to decompress, and to share state secrets. A place where revolutions are planned and executions are ordered. Uncle! I'm so happy to see you. The Romans sure knew how to live. It's good they raped and pillaged their way across the world, or we wouldn't have all this. I've heard so much about you. I feel we practically know each other. I feel the same. I'm ashamed to say this, I'm somewhat of a fan. In Buenos Aires, I actually had a photo of you up on my mantelpiece. As... Oh, I'm sorry. Aah! Now this is bliss. So, what brings you here tonight, Uncle? Well, whatever it is, I'm glad we get to spend some time together. General, I feel so privileged to have had this opportunity, you know, to be able to observe our enemy from such proximity. Their houses... I saw their villages. And Lake Tiberias. - I always imagined it would be bigger. - Hm. Do you know why the Lake Tiberias, the Sea of Galilee, as they call it, is so important to the Israelis? Water is the most vital substance for a living organism, and for a country. Without it there is no life, only death. The Sea of Galilee is the only water source the Israelis have. It feeds all their citizens, north all the way down to the desert. General, they're getting ready. You're leaving? Yes, unfortunately, the world continues, even though here, it seems to pause. Enjoy the rest of your evening. It was a pleasure to meet you. I hope we can continue it soon. I'm jealous of you. Of me? Why? Everyone respects you, likes you, from the moment they first meet you. Oh, it's no different with you. No. When you walk into a room... everyone wants a piece of you. Did you see how my uncle immediately took to you? It's because I have money, Ma'azi, nothing more. I have my jokes, my connections, my uniform, but... I don't have that thing you have. Strong hashish, Ma'azi. What... What are you talking about? Sometimes I feel like... my whole life... is just one big lie. That's all. How come... How come you're not in a relationship? Every woman in Damascus would love to be with you. I suppose I haven't met the right one yet. What about Saliha? Abu Mahmoud's daughter? Too early to tell. Did you... Did you fuck her? Why are you asking? I'm sure you've had many... women? Uh, I'm talking too much. The heat. The hookah. I better go. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. Hatoum sent me. One moment, I'm just getting dressed. Wait. There's no need to do this. I cannot. Why can't you? Yes... why can't you? Oh! It's a miracle. It's the most she's slept since she was born. Is she breathing? Here, Sophie. Here, give her to me. You should go to bed for a bit. I'm fine keeping an eye on them both. - No. - I don't have to be back at work today. I'll wake you up in a few hours. - Are you sure? - Please, for me. Dada! - Aah... - Hello! What you doing there? Is it a duckie? Is that a duckie? The Israelis will learn a lesson tonight. You are leaving in exactly 14 minutes. You will blow up the water pipe only at three o'clock exactly. Come on. Tiberias, Tiberias. Do you copy, over? Tiberias, Tiberias. Do you copy, over? Hello. Hello. Can you hear me, over? Israel, Tiberias. Can you hear me, over? Tiberias. Israel. Can you hear me, Israel? Uh... Don't shoot. I'm just here to get my cow. I'm not looking for trouble. What's your name? Shmulik. Dagan! Dagan! Quiet! You couldn't stop them, the army couldn't stop them, so I had to. That's why I didn't call them. Oh, God... He drove himself. On a tractor. And you were the first one to talk to him? I'm the only one he talked to. I'm Lieutenant Colonel Dagan. I'm the commander here. Shlomo, but everyone calls me Shmulik. Okay, I understand you have something you want to tell me. Wake everybody up. Everyone. The whole sector. Where the hell were you? I was looking all over for you. I was out smoking. And jogging? It's a long story. I heard a noise. I went outside. I thought maybe it was an Israeli. Turned out it was a wild pig. I was afraid that, uh... maybe you left. Why would I do that? Well, uh... things got a bit, uh... You know, I... I was high, and... perhaps my behavior... it was... Sorry for the interruption. There was an incident at the border. Don't leave your rooms tonight, okay? What kind of incident? What happened? I just know that you're supposed to stay here. Okay. I should head back, then. I think we could both use some sleep. Why is your leg bleeding? What? Your leg. It's an old wound that opened up. About tonight... I... I don't want you to think that... You know, I... I value your friendship. - Wouldn't want to lose you. - You can trust me... with your life. I hope I can do the same, Ma'azi. We all have secrets. Good morning. I made coffee. I don't know how you take your eggs, but I made scrambled. Hopefully these are good. It's been a while. What are you doing here, Dan? I mean, really? Wh... What are you really doing here? Eli can't be your only employee. No. No, I have a few. Do you spend your nights with their wives as well? Making them breakfast? I'm sorry if I offended you, I just wanted to help. You want to help? Where is my husband? I think you should go. Eli is enough. Sometimes he doesn't realize it, but he is enough. In his mind, he needs to provide better, to do great things with his life, to live up to his own expectations, but all of that is not true, because he is enough. He told me that working for the government might lead to him being an ambassador one day. He looked at me, and said that I will be Mrs. Ambassador. But I don't want to be Mrs. Ambassador. I want to be Mrs. Eli Cohen. That's all I ever wanted. I know that by giving him this job, you made his dreams come true, but by making his dreams come true, you've ruined mine. You really want to help? Bring me back my husband. ♪ Lo sai ♪ ♪ Non è vero ♪ ♪ Che non ti voglio più ♪ ♪ Lo so ♪ This is George Seif, Radio Damascus. Israeli officials report a Syrian unit was captured while crossing the border early this morning. Syria is denying any knowledge of this operation, blaming Zionist propaganda for this false report. This will be so demoralizing for the soldiers we met. I'm going to send them a gift. What kind of gift? This is amazing. Amazing. He wants this much for eucalyptus trees? Why? Fuck. Uh... Mr. Suidani. I'm sure... this must seem strange. I do not usually show up uninvited. Can I help you in any way? It's hot. Could I bother you for some water? Forgive me. I should have offered. It's just I was a little surprised. I was just taking a nap. You live in this big apartment all by yourself? Well, as far as I know. I mean, it's big enough for somebody to live here without my knowledge, you know? Here. You've made a nice life for yourself here in Damascus. Your friends are powerful people. These things... do not go... unnoticed. I'm not sure I know what you mean. - I would like you to come with me, please. - Now? I hope you don't mind. Not at all. Wait here, please. Do you know who I am? Of course, you're Michel Aflaq, the author of The Battle for One Destiny and the leader of the Ba'ath movement. Hm. Freedom of thought is always a scary thing for those who are in power. So they give you a title, which makes it easy for them to get rid of you. Let me get to the point, Mr. Thaabeth. Certain people told me you might be a supporter. Is that true? It is treason to support the Ba'ath. In these times, one can never be too careful, true. But our movement is spreading all over the Arab world, and soon we'll take over it, inshallah, with the help of young leaders like Saddam Hussein in Iraq and here in Syria. Is this why you brought me here? To quiz me about my politics? It wasn't me who brought you here. General. Kamel. - So good to see you again, my friend. - You, too. I, uh... apologize for the secrecy. Ah, think nothing of it. So this means you're officially back? Uh... Not officially, no. Well, we were just discussing Kamel's dedication to the cause. Well, you know me. I'll do anything you need. What is it that you want? I need to ask you for a favor. We, uh... need you to throw a party. A party? Yes. You'll be given a date, sometime in the future, and you will start inviting certain people to extravagant parties at your place. You need to make sure that your friend's uncle, General Ad-Din, attends these parties, together with these members of the Cabinet. Welcome, Mr. Thaabeth. Welcome to the future of Syria. So, what's going on? It seems we have struck luck for the second time this week. What are you talking about? In addition to the anonymous tip we got about the infiltration, it just became a lot easier to pinpoint the location of the Syrian fortifications. How? Take a look for yourself. Move. They are planting trees. Probably for shade. It's happening all across the border. North to south. Ah! Indeed... luck has struck again.
