 You are a lucky cheat. I have something called skill. Not that I need much of it to beat you with. I thought I read in your Al Ahram Al Arabi newspaper that the Argentinians would win this easily. Yet another brilliant analysis. It's not enough you're insulting me with your luck. Now you're insulting my newspaper. You call that piece of toilet paper a newspaper? That is an insult to serious journalism. The only thing that is factual in it

 is its title. Look at all your faces. Don't worry. Kamel is the biggest ad buyer in my toilet paper of a newspaper. Abdul! Tea, please, for myself and a sore loser. Ah. Well. - That's that. - Already? I reset the board. What's the point in another one? We know how this ends. Lucky cheat!

 Hola, mi amor. ...nuclear weapons... Oh. Hello. Hi. Sorry, it's mine. Here. I'm Dan Peleg. I work with your husband. I'm sorry about the mess. I don't usually entertain these days, but Eli's mother and his brothers are coming for dinner, so I... What is it that you do with Eli? I lend support to all our buyers around the world. That's really why I came today. I wanted to leave you this. In case you needed anything. - Nadia! - What? Telephone. I'm sorry. There's only one phone in the building, so it might be important. No, no, of course. - I'll be right back. - Okay. I'm sorry I took so long. I left a business card here. I didn't mean to bother you. I should go. No, please. That was Sophie, Eli's mother. She's not feeling so well, so... will you stay for dinner? Oh, I, uh... I couldn't, uh... I'm a Sephardic woman. I'm not going to let you go home unfed, especially if you work with Eli. What can I do to help? Sit. I hope you're hungry. Actually, I am. Good. I made a lot. Do you like it spicy? Uh, I do, actually. Good. Dearest N, it happened again. And again, foolishly, I was convinced it might be you. I see your face everywhere. I hear your laughter. But when I turn, you're not there. Hola? Hey, Julia. - Ahem. - Come in. Yes. Uh... I have the invitation for tomorrow night. - You got it, good. - Yes. And also more information on the guests that will be attending. Pay attention to the Syrian military members. Particularly I need you to... General Amin Al-Hafez, the military attaché. - Yes. - We believe that if and when power shifts, he will play a major role in the Syrian politics. Yes. Good. Also, I... Yes, I... I know. Don't approach him too soon. Take my time. So, can I offer you something to drink? Tea or... some Scotch? You shouldn't have Scotch, Kamel, but since you have it... with ice. And no, I have new orders. We need to move faster than we planned. If you see him, try to connect and charm him. We need those recommendation letters. Why the sudden urgency? Does this mean I'm going to Damascus soon? I only tell you what they tell me. I don't... What is this? Oh, that's nothing. No, this is not nothing. What is this? Who are you writing? Who is "N"? It's nothing. It's stupid... Nadia. - I sometimes write them just to pass the... - Who is Nadia? Who is Nadia? It's the name of my wife. I thought you were not married. Ah, okay. Kamel is not married. - Eli is married... - There is no Eli. It just sometimes helps me feel a bit less lonely. Kamel doesn't get lonely. Okay, fine, so I won't write them anymore. Them? There are more? Where? Eh, listen... I'm not doing anything with them. - I just thought maybe... - Ugh. It's stupid. I thought maybe one day when this is all over, maybe I could bring them back and you know, show... No, no, no, no, no! No. No, you don't do that! This is not a game, Kamel. This is not a role that you are playing. You are either him or you are dead! I understand. I don't think that you do. Give it to me. I'm gonna have to report this. She's never going to read them, I promise. - Who will never read them? - I understand, Julia! Come on! What if the police came here? What if someone other than me found these? Huh? Eli doesn't exist. Nadia doesn't exist. I understand, Julia. Say it. Eli doesn't exist. Say it. Say it! Nadia doesn't... exist. Come, come, Kamel. I want you to meet the military attaché. General Amin Al-Hafez. I am honored, General, to meet one of the greatest living Syrians. Kamel grew up in Argentina, but has expressed great interest in returning to Syria, and using his great wealth to invest in its future. - Yeah. - And this is my wife, Zeinab. I'm delighted to meet you. - Would you mind a smile for the camera? - Please. Shukran. Where did you learn that? College in Switzerland. Can't remember a thing I studied, but, uh... my bartending skills are still intact. What can I make you, my friend? I cannot. Oh, you're more devout than I. I'm not proud, but I can't resist a good Scotch. Right, Zeinab? That's right, my love. Well, the only judge is Allah. You, yourself, uh... you're not married? You know, I'm not. Uh... Turns out money can't buy you love. Well, Zeinab and I can introduce you to some beautiful women. Oh! Just because he's not married doesn't mean he needs our help getting women, Amin. He's rich... and handsome. I'm sure Mr. Thaabeth has his own fair share of women. Don't you? Well, I wasn't suggesting he needs help from an old fart like me when it comes to women. Okay, if not alcohol, uh... care to join me for a cigar? Yes, I'd love to. Come. Aah. So, uh, your father grew up in Damascus? He did. He never returned there. It was one of the greatest regrets of his life. But... But he followed the ups and downs of Syrian politics right up until his death. That's a full-time job. And a very badly paid one. When did he die? Two and a half years ago. It was just me and him at the end. My mother had already passed. Before he died, he told me... not to wait anymore. Not to spend my time living in a place that was not my homeland. - Mm. - I think he would be so pleased knowing that I'm planning on moving to Damascus. What did he die of? Pancreatic cancer. And your mother? Car accident. I'm sorry to hear that. And where are they buried? Why? A few months ago, the Zionists kidnapped Adolf Eichmann right by his house on Garibaldi Street. They smuggled him unconscious onto a plane and took him all the way to Israel. As fun as Buenos Aires is, it's also filled with spies. Listen. I'm a businessman, General. I, too, do my own research. Before I invest in something, or someone... I conduct my own investigations, so I understand the value of due diligence. Plot 56, row two, at the Recoleta Cemetery. I apologize. I, myself, am easygoing, but the head of my security, Ahmed Suidani, is a little more paranoid than me. I guess that's his job. Hello. Come. Let's continue our conversation outside. Excellent. Thank you. So you, yourself, have never been to Syria? I feel like I have through my father's many memories. I'm not sure that your father's memories are of the same place. I tend to agree. But I believe our country's best days are ahead of her. For that, we need an independent Syria that is a leader of an Arab renaissance to rival Europe, to rival the United States. Al-Kudsi can't do that. Now that Syria's out from under Egypt's thumb, there's only one party that can do that. The Ba'ath. And that is why I intend to go back, and to invest my time, my energy, my money, to ensure that Syria regains her deserved stature in the world. These things shouldn't be discussed out in the open. You never know who might be listening. Now, let's get back to the party before my wife assaults another man. There's not much that escapes my eyes. I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do. I should be the one apologizing to you. She grabbed you by the balls, and you behaved like a real gentlemen. Mustafa. I want you to look at this. Unlock the door. Suidani. It's here. The Thaabeth graves. He was telling the truth. Good. Come back. Zürich. Eight, two, eight, four, six. Yes! Thaabeth Exports. Did you see anyone come out of here? I left my camera, but I can't find it. Did you see someone? Someone out of here? Hola. Julia, can you meet me at La Paz? I'll be there in an hour. What is this? When I was studying the files during training, there were lots of names, but very few photographs attached to them. I thought maybe this could help. These were not your orders. Nobody asked you to... He's from the Embassy. - No, wait! - Hey, come... ¿Que pasa? Okay. Okay. Get out of here. Before anyone sees you. - What are you gonna do with him? - I'll handle it! You've never been here. I said go! Go! Get the hell out of here! Right. And here are the names of the new survivors found this week in Europe. Malka Zaidel, Krakow. Paula Lovi, Galicia. Mordechai Ben-Dov... My two sisters. ...Berlin. Yousef Yotscapolak, - Krakow. - It's futile. I know in my head they're gone, but my heart refuses to give up. Janus Behelda-Goldstein... Every day, I sit here listening to the names, thinking that maybe... Fantasizing what it would be like if I saw them again. ...Budapest... My two wonderful sisters. ...Vilna. Israel Figelbun, Byalystok. Manache Menuchim... How is it going? That's why I wanted to talk to you about. This is a mistake. Eli. The whole thing. I'm following the progress reports. He's good. - He's learning very fast. - He's too eager. He's not our guy. I think we need to cancel the whole thing, start again. Search for a new agent. - Have you lost your mind? - He's got something to prove. He wants it too badly. I understand you feel responsible for him. Don't patronize me, okay? We need to keep looking. We need more time. You need to calm down. Eighteen years, that's all it's been. Eighteen years since we were told that nothing bad is going to happen to us. That we have time. That we should stay put. The world won't let anything bad happen to us, they said. Well, the world doesn't care if we live or die. And if we don't take care of ourselves, no one will. There's no time, Dan. Time was never on our side. I spoke to the office. Since we don't know the level of threat we are dealing with, we sit tight. Stay here. Go to the Damascus Club if you want to. Play backgammon, but stay away from the Embassy. What about the letter of recommendation? You said that I can't get into Syria without it. - Kamel... - There's a way to fix this. If they suspect me, then the last thing that they expect is for me to turn up - and to ask for entry papers. - Absolutely not. No. But then the whole operation is at risk. And whose fault is that? So then let me fix it. You weren't there last night. I made a real connection with Al-Hafez. You have your orders. Stay put. Hello, sir. Give me your passport, please. - Of course. - Thank you. - Thank you. - I was here last night at the ball. - Thank you. - Welcome. Welcome, sir. Mr. Thaabeth. - Mr. Suidani. - What... Can I help you? I was just, uh... dropping off these bags at Al-Hafez's office. I know the way. I'll take you there. I appreciate that. Thank you. Well, this is a pleasant surprise. Well, I don't like to turn up uninvited, but... our conversation last night left me elated. I feel so privileged to have had the ear of one of Syria's real hero. Ah, on the contrary, it was a pleasure to speak to such a patriot. But what is all this? Oh, these are small tokens of my appreciation. Ah. The winters in Buenos Aires can be brutal. I hope Zeinab will find this somewhat helpful. Oh, it's fantastic. - She'll be over the moon. - No, it's nothing. And this is for you. - This is unnecessary. - No, no, no, no. - Ah... - Our conversation last night... it strengthened my resolve to return to the homeland. I've decided to move my trip up. I will be heading soon to Europe, and from there, directly to Damascus. And I have a recommendation letter from Latif to gain me entry, which I hope will be sufficient. Oh, please. I will write you another letter. - No, no, no, no. That's too much to ask. - Nonsense, it will be my privilege. Is there anything I can do to repay the debt? I'm sure I can think of something. You know, a man of your stature... One day you'll need an infrastructure and allies around you to help you rise to the position that you deserve to be. That will require money and that is something, Alhamdulillāh, that I have. What's more important to me is loyalty. And from what I've seen so far, that is something you possess as well. Know that when the time comes, I will be there for you. The stitching is impeccable. You always do excellent work. It's only impressive because I can barely reach the machine now. Are you okay? Yes, of course. Tova! - Are you sure? - Yeah. Nadia? Nadia! We have to go to the hospital. Not without Eli. No. Take your clothes off, Kamel. We've packed your things and bought some presents for your family. And, uh... we also bought this. Wh... When? A few days ago. Wh... Why didn't someone tell me? I didn't know. Because you were Kamel. Eli, you just came back. Leave me. Thank you for calling her Sophie. You made my mother so happy, and you know that's not an easy thing to do. She came out exactly like her. Pushy, loud. It seemed appropriate. Like your mother, she's always hungry. Here. - Thank you for coming this late. - Of course. You can wait outside. Now, I'm glad you called, and I understand how you feel. I have a daughter now. She... She is so... so beautiful and pure. She looks just like Nadia. I don't want to... I don't want to go back. You know, because of what you did, we have so much more information available to us. We have a better understanding of the region already. That saves lives. This whole business with the camera bag... - I know I made a mistake. - Agents need to follow the plan set out for them by their handlers. I... I'm sorry, I know. But at the end of the day, you're alone in the field. And sometimes you need to make a decision that isn't cleared by us. That's part of the job. It's why we chose you, because you have good instincts. Because we trust your judgment. Just because it wasn't part of the plan, doesn't mean it was a mistake. Because of me, a man is dead. You are saving lives, Eli. Not taking them. Remember that. What? You were against Eli from the moment we identified him as a possible agent. You thought he didn't have what it took to do this. Now you're basically making him go? What changed? Nothing changed. He's got a job to do and I'm here to help him do it. You sure nothing changed? So what? You think I'm sending her husband to his death, so I can, uh... Is that really what you think of me? I'm just trying to understand why you have a picture of her in your house. To remind me of the price, Maya. My job is to train him and to make sure he's safe. To make sure when it's all done, he comes back. Because of her. Because of what they have. This thing I have with Nadia Cohen... it's not romantic. I'm so happy you're here, Eli. Don't leave us. Please. ♪ Inconnu ♪ ♪ Mon amour ♪
