 Dozens of lawyers have tried to build a case against them, and it's never worked. I have a friend. He may know some things. Did something happen to you over there while you were working for Erickson? I led a unit... for a mission we should've never been on. You don't go near Sanchez, understood? If anyone finds out about that last mission... That's why I sent him to a psychiatrist. Shrink's job to get the truth out the boy and the truth just isn't our friend. Something happened on that last mission, and High Star is covering it up. The men who died, you knew them. These were your men. High Star's over there, they're breaking the law for profit, and - they're accountable to no one. - What would you need me to do? Sync by n17t01 www.addic7ed.com

 ♪ Little lamb ♪ ♪ When I am through with you There won't be anything left ♪ When I am through with you There won't be anything left When I am through with you. ♪ Damages - 4x02 "I've Done Too Much For This Girl" Is that important? I assume that's important. I'm, uh, trying a case against the world's largest pharmaceutical company. I mean... it could mean hundreds of millions of dollars for my client, so... you tell me. Sounds important. Mm-hmm. Look, you're in here, so... you might as well talk to me. Okay. Let's talk. Tell me about you. Was being a therapist always your dream, or was medical school just... too tough? We've had this discussion. The therapy is not about me. We need to discuss how you ended up here, and then I have to sign off on your progress. Powerful feeling, isn't it? Do you like that? On your personal form, you wrote that you have a son. Maybe we should talk about him. He's my only child. He ran away three years ago and left me with his baby daughter to take care of. I recently hired somebody to track him down. Seems to be a lot in there to discuss. There isn't. Have you had contact with, um... Michael. Michael? No, I haven't. I'm not holding my breath. Are you still taking care of your granddaughter? Yes. But I can't find a nanny. That's my problem. Oh. I'm afraid our session's over. How many more of these do we have? Well, this is our second meeting, and, um, eight more sessions are required. But next time we have to, uh, talk about why you got here in the first place. I can't wait. Pleasure. Sanchez. Sanchez. Sanchez. Lowry, come on, motherfucker, breathe! Jay Rayburn, Robert Franks, Thomas Lowry-- All killed while working for High Star. High Star conducted an illegal mission at the order of company CEO Howard Erickson. During the execution of this mission, these men lost their lives. And you're proposing that we file a wrongful death suit against High Star? Yes, sir. This is Jessica Lowry, Thomas Lowry's widow. She represents the men's families, all of whom are willing to be plaintiffs in the suit. Who's this fourth man? Chris Sanchez. He was in charge of the unit. Mr. Sanchez has since resigned from High Star, and he's willing to give eyewitness testimony against the company. What does he say happened on the mission? Understandably, Mr. Sanchez is concerned about the potential consequences of testifying, so before he gives any details he wants to be certain that the firm will support the case. How many other cases have been brought against High Star? Almost 60, and they've all been dismissed. But... none of them have had my witness. This is a very compelling case, Ellen. Are you sure Mr. Sanchez will cooperate? Yes. He's assured me he will. Good girl. Good girl. It was buzzing. I.D. says "Ellen." Hey, Chris, it's me, calling to see how you're doing. I pitched the case to the partners. We should get an answer back soon. Call me back, okay? Who's Ellen? No one. Friend from high school. Fire was caused by a gas explosion, which they believe to have originated in the office of an Upper West Side psychiatrist, Dr. Raul Barrera. The 52-year-old victim was pronounced dead at the scene. Three firefighters also suffered minor injuries battling the blaze. An investigation into the cause of the explosion continues. Reporting live on the Upper West Side, Tara Lynn Wagner, New York 1. Are you okay? Where are you going? It was the same doctor I went to. You think someone is targeting you? I don't know, but I had an appointment scheduled this morning. You need anything, Ellen? I can put on a pot of coffee. I'm fine. Thank you, Kevin. Who referred you to this doctor? A friend-- A.C. Does he work for High Star? Yeah. But you dont understand. A.C. trained me, he saved my life, like, a half a dozen times-- The guy's like a brother to me. Does he know that - you've been talking to a lawyer? - No. Does anyone at High Star know that we've been in contact? No, I've told no one. Chris. It's okay. I need you to keep to yourself for a little while. Can you do that? I don't want you talking to anyone from the company. Whatever you say. I'm also gonna hire private security for you. I don't need that. Just to make sure... What, so I could have more guys with guns hanging around me? I can take care of myself, okay? I can take care of my fuckin' self. Just... calm down. I don't want anyone to know that you've been talking to a lawyer. So we shouldn't be in contact until I have official word from my firm and we're ready to file a case. Fine. Once I have the resources, we'll figure out this explosion and exactly what is going on. Chris? Are you still willing to testify? If it will help my guys' families. That's what this is all about. Come on, Ghwarri. Come on, girl. That's great. Thank you. Thank you, Sean. Okay, well... I'll see you back at the office. Yeah. Okay. Okay, bye. Sorry I'm late. I had therapy. Therapy? Could I have a cup of tea, please? Thank you. Ah... I thought you didn't believe in therapy. Yeah, well, this is court-ordered. It's all Perry's fault. Your doorman? I was late for a meeting. I was in the lobby waiting for him to open the door for me, and he just stood there, rambling on about the goddamn weather. I pushed past him... and the door hit him in the face. I accidentally broke his nose. Accidentally. The prick pressed charges. The judge let me off provided I go to therapy. Anyway, listen... I need a new nanny. Still? Where's Catherine? In the office with my assistant. Do you know of anyone? I mean, y-you must have friends who have kids. In Jersey, sure. But none of them can afford nannies. Oh, God. I'll be in your shoes tomorrow night-- Baby-sitting my niece when my sister goes Christmas shopping. Well... do you want to get them together? Like a playdate? I mean, it would, you know, give me a break and... burn off some of Catherine's energy. Yeah, could be good. Maybe. Oh, thank you. So, I pitched the High Star case to the firm yesterday. You didn't take my advice. Have you convinced your friend to be a witness? Yeah. Although it may have made him into a target. Do the people at High Star know that he's talking to you? He says no, but the explosion uptown may have been meant for him. Your firm is never gonna let you try this case, Ellen. Why do you say that? Because ever since Hollis Nye retired, they have no backbone. Defendants like this terrify them. You'll see. They'll fold. Well, they already said yes. Really? Got the call before you came. Well... good for you. I stand corrected. And here I was talking about nannies. I'm taking my witness's statement in the morning. This is going to be a big step for you, Ellen. Congratulations. Thanks. I... I should run. I'm sorry. I'll take care of this. Don't worry. So you'll think about the playdate? I will. Thanks for the coffee. What the fuck were you thinking?! I've sent dozens of my men to that shrink. I trusted him! I told you not to send Sanchez to a psychiatrist. So you blast his office! First of all, I didn't do anything to that poor doctor. I saw it on the news, just like everybody else. Damn shame. Con Ed had the place all wired wrong. You wipe that fuckin' smirk off your face. I followed your wishes 100%. You told me to stay away from Sanchez, and I did. This stops right here, right now, you hear me? Nobody else gets hurt, do you understand? I couldn't agree with you more, but that lawyer, Ellen Parsons, we need to find a way to keep Sanchez away from her. What are you suggesting? Well, we could pay him, I suppose. He's already turned down a promotion. Or threaten him. He's one of my top employees. Look... as long as he's in this country, there's no guarantees of us being protected. Now, the best move you could make is to redeploy him. The kid's damaged goods. I can't send him back to a war zone. I'm all ears. You got a better idea? Yeah? Sanchez. Mr. Erickson. Mind if I step inside? No, sir. Come on in. I'm sorry, I-I'm just surprised to see you here, sir. I know. I wanted to talk to you face-to-face. A.C. told me you've been going through a tough time. Yes, sir. I guess I have. And then there's this explosion uptown. Can I get you a beer or something, sir? Sure, why not? Beer wouldn't do me wrong right about now. Thank you. I'm very concerned about this whole thing. A.C. got Dr. Barrera's name from me. The doctor was an old friend of mine. News said it was a gas leak. I talked to several guys I know at the city's antiterrorism task force. They investigate these things. They're certain it was a faulty valve. Listen, son... I'm not sure I believe it myself. I'm afraid someone's targeting the company somehow. We got a lot of enemies. I thought someone was maybe targeting me. Who would do that? I don't know, sir. But that last mission... Yeah. That was rough. Look, Chris... Sometimes we come home, our trauma clouds our heads. We start seeing the enemy everywhere. But I can tell you this-- No one at High Star questions your loyalty. Well, I know, sir. I'm sorry if I implied... We're here to protect you. I heard the families of my men got nothing from the company. We're not the military. Those men signed the same contract as you. There's no provision for death pay. Listen... I know you turned down my offer a couple months back. A.C. told me your mother's been sick. So if you're having money troubles, I'd be happy to put that offer back on the table. You want me to redeploy? Only if it would help. I can always use a man like you. I'd be no good to you right now. I really need to see a... A doctor. I understand. And... if you change your mind... I'm not going back, sir. All right. I hear you loud and clear. Thanks for the beer. We're a family, Sanchez. We've got your back. You hear me? Thank you, sir. You'll be a good girl at the office today? Mm-hmm. Okay. These came for you. I think they're baby supplies. Thank you, Perry. Are you feeling any better today? I'm not. I think the weather aggravates my injury. Well, any day you'll be back to normal. Maybe. Maybe not. Call Jim Girotto. I want to move the deposition again. Got it. And, uh, you'll continue to take care of Catherine in the office until I can find help. You'll be bringing her to work every day? Yes. So make sure that she doesn't catch her little hand in a stapler. Or something. And call someone. I want the whole office child-proofed. Okay. Uh, Mr. Huntley's waiting for you. Send him in. I ran Michael's photo and personal information through the system. And no hospital or morgue had any John Does that matched his description. Of course not, Mr. Huntley, Michael isn't dead. He's running from his responsibilities. Right. Oh, and also, um, he's not part of the prison system. I-I checked that out. How about money? Um... Well, he... I think two years ago... Two, yeah, two years ago, he, uh, withdrew $500 from an ATM uptown. Um... and that seems to be his last financial transaction. He's never used his credit cards? Um, no, there's... no record of that. Oh, and, um... about your ex-husband. Is there any chance that Mr. Grey may have been helping your son out? I've spoken to Phil. Michael hasn't contacted him. Well, he-he never contacted, uh... Jill Burnham, either. I guess... I guess you forgot to, um, to mention her. There's no reason to. Right, she's just the mother of his child. Not legally. I made sure of that. Right, so, um, you said that, um, the last time you saw Michael was three years ago. Now that's right around the time of your car accident, right? Yes. It's interesting. You know, the timing. It's just... What's next, Mr. Huntley? Oh, I, um, I'd like to talk to his peers. Um, I'll need a list of his friends and any people that he socialized with. I'm only aware of a few. He was very secretive about his private life. Well, we'll start with the ones you know, and maybe that will lead us to some... some secrets. I'll get you a list. Thank you. Thank you. Ellen. Hey, babe. Where you headed? Picking up Chris. Bringing him in to take his statement. Ellen, wait. What's that look on your face? Sorry, I... I hate to tell you this. What? You said yes. I told my witness we have a case. We reconsidered. Why are you turning this down? The inordinate cost in a case of this nature, both in terms of time and resources, is not in the best interest of the firm. You're scared. You're afraid of High Star. Ms. Parsons, I think you're mistaking naiveté for courage. Nye, Everett has been around for, what, over 100 years. Thousands of clients and employees. We're not going to risk getting sucked into some legal black hole that could put the very existence of this firm in jeopardy. Hollis Nye would have backed me on this. Mr. Nye isn't here anymore. Sometimes the better part of valor is to cover your ass and survive to fight another day. That's not valor, sir. That's chickenshit. Ellen, hey. Hey, Chris. Listen, there's been a change of plans. We're not going to be taking your statement today. Why not? I just need a little more time on my end to figure things out. Procedural stuff. Okay. Okay. How are you doing? I'm fine. Are you sure you don't want me to look into security for you? Yeah, no, I'm good. Uh, so, we'll talk soon, I guess. Yeah. Absolutely. Hang in there, okay? What are you doing? You didn't tell him. I'm not giving up. There's no case. Maybe I'll try it on my own. How? You have no resources. Chris has put himself out there for me. I-I can't just leave him dangling. I'm not sure you have a choice. There's a way to try this case, I just haven't figured it out yet. Ellen, if you really want to do this... Yeah? I hate to mention it, but... what about Patty? What about her? You haven't thought about it? Taking the case to her? It's an option. No. Not an option. I would never ask her for help. Maybe if she offered, but... I don't want to owe that woman anything. Ever. Yo. Thanks for coming. I don't like to be too far from my place these days. What's going on? Your boss came to see me. Yeah, I know. So you spoke with him. That shit with Dr. Barrera hit him hard. He wanted to see you, so I gave him your address. I hope that's okay. Yeah, sure. - Could I ask you something? - Of course. I know you're tight with Erickson. Why is he so worried about me? What do you mean? Is he afraid I'm going to talk about the mission? Fuck, no. I told him you're solid. He's not afraid of you, Chris, he's worried about your health. All right. Thanks, I just wanted to hear it from you. Hey. Want to grab a bite to eat? There's a good Chinese joint up the block. Let's do it. Let me just get Ghwarri. Yeah, how is she? She's good. Fuck! Did you see where it came from? Across the street, fifth floor. Fuck! Fucking foreign cigarettes. Check it out. Is someone clocking you, bro? Who the fuck would be coming after you? Kalashnikov. I'm still kind of in shock. I can't believe they turned down the case. Trust me, they didn't even consider it. Firms don't practice law, they calculate risk. I mean, you see it everywhere. No one has the stomach for a case like that. Must have been difficult news for your witness. I didn't tell him yet. I thought I might try the case on my own. You can't. I know, I know, I'm... fooling myself. I... I can't drag Chris through the fire without any resources. And what would you do if you could find the resources? I'd try the case. You're right. It's not going to happen. Finding resources like that is practically impossible. Looks like you've hit a dead end. Catherine! Spit that out. Right now. That's not for eating. Good girl. Why would a haji be targeting you in New Jersey? Maybe some kind of blowback from the mission. What do you mean? Fuck, man, we didn't exactly make friends over there. We killed Afghanis. Maybe it's coming back to bite me in the ass. Chris, we gotta stay calm. I want to talk with Erickson. Come with me back to the compound. You'll be safe there. I-I can't. I gotta, I gotta go home. No, you can't. All my gear's there. My-my-my dog. Think about it. You're being targeted. Some sniper with a fucking Kalashnikov knows your routine. You think they're waiting for me? 'Cause I'd love to meet 'em. You're not going anywhere. You're not in the right frame of mind, Chris. I don't work for High Star anymore! I don't have to take fucking orders from you, A.C.! As-salaam alaikum. Who are you? You'll never know. Why don't you indulge me for a minute? Is that why we're here, to indulge you? No, we're here so you don't end up with a felony battery on your record. Go on. Why don't you try answering a few questions honestly? Who knows? If you cooperate, maybe we can cut the session short. Ask your questions. Who do you call when you're sick? I don't get sick. But if you did, if you wake up feeling, you know, violently ill, who would you call? 911. Your husband's remarried, you don't speak to your son, so in whom do you confide? My dog. Look, we can sit here and punch the clock for months, but it gets a little boring, don't you think? It's very boring. It's funny. Yeah? There's a woman who used to work for me. That you confide in? No, no, I'm not talking about that. This woman wants to try a case right now, and she needs my help to do it. She wants it very badly. I could help her. I could give her everything she needs. But I don't want to. Why not? I'm not sure. The arrangement could even benefit me. But you deny her. Because I've already helped her enough. I've done way too much for this girl. Well, maybe you see something in her. At first she was just a means to an end. Should have cut her off as soon as she served her purpose. But you didn't. No. And why do you think that is? Everything she has now is because of me and she still wants more. You didn't answer my question. Why do you keep her around? Let's try this. Why do you want to kill Chris Sanchez? I don't. Please. No! You want revenge, don't you? That's why you want to kill him. Yes, yes, yes! I-I've come for revenge! What the fuck you doing here?! Hey, Sanchez, you gonna let me in? Answer the question! I came to warn you. You're in danger. How do you know that? I need you to take a ride with me. Why? Look, Sanchez, if you don't trust me, bring your toolbox. Come on. It's in the back. Does this have to do with the mission? I'm afraid so. Mr. Erickson said the intelligence we got out of there paid off. Did it? That's classified. My fuckin' men were killed. I want to know. Yeah, it paid off. Come on. You can throw your guns down wherever you want. You live here? Ah, I do work here from time to time. More like an office. Tell me what the fuck we're doing here. Come here. Come. What you're about to see... You never saw it. You understand? I understand. Who is this? His name is Salam Fazel. He was sent here to kill you. This his? Yeah. Who sent him here? This man. Nur Taraki. He's a mullah. Taliban-- Big deal with them. Unfortunately, on that last mission, you and your men killed his brother. Now he's looking for payback. How do you know all this? I'm tracking the fallout on that mission. They've got this mullah on a watch list. And his communications led us to this shitbag over here. This guy wants revenge for the mullah's brother? Ask him. You think I killed this man's brother? You think I killed his brother? You kill Nur Taraki's brother, now I kill you. Maybe I did kill him, but guess what? You cocksuckers killed my men. So fuck you. Relax. I'm only telling you this 'cause we don't know how many of these scumbags are out there. This mullah has access to cells in the States. We've got to assume they're coming after you. I think they already have. What do you mean? That explosion uptown? I was supposed to be in that building. Then this cocksucker took a shot at me. Right? Right? We found this. It's a Kalashnikov. Is there somewhere you can go for protection? Mullah Nur Taraki. Supposedly we took out his brother, now he's coming after me. And Boorman told you this? Yeah. If this mullah knows that you worked for High Star, then he could start targeting the whole company. Don't get too excited now. Let's-let's be smart about this. The way I see it, you should stay here at the compound till we sort this out. You're safe here. No one can touch you. Or I could redeploy. You told me yourself, that's not an option. I want to go back over there and waste this mullah motherfucker before he gets to me. If you want to do that, Chris, I'm going with you. Let me think about this. Chris? Hey, I need to see you. Did you get my messages? Yeah, I'd rather not talk on the phone. I need your help. Can you come to my place? I can be there at 11:00, is that okay? I'll see you then. Great. Thanks for meeting me so last minute. Sure. What's going on? I wanted to let you know that I've decided to try the High Star case on my own. I filed the case. Ellen, you'll be crushed. Then I'll be crushed. I'm not going to back down. It's a terrible idea. I have to try, Patty. I think you should step back, regroup, find another case. Ellen Parsons? Don't make us bring the war to you, bitch. You all right? Not really. This is what I'm going to be up against if I go through with this. Howard Erickson has way too much to lose. That's why someone has to take him down. You said yourself that I can't try this case alone. I know I did. But I changed my mind. If you back down now, you'll just be another attorney. Maybe that's all I am. Well, then you're at a turning point. Decide what you want. I thought I had what it takes, but... You're tougher than you think. I'm not you, Patty. I don't think I can live like this anymore. Let me help you. Help how? Use my firm, my resources. I'm grateful, Patty, but no. The case will be 100% yours. I have no interest in interfering. But I'll support you any way you want. I don't know. Let me help you. I owe it to you. My witness's name is Chris Sanchez. I'll meet with him tomorrow. Ellen, gang's all here. Oh, hey, guys. You were fantastic. Tony, scary as hell. I had no idea. Come on, I was a varsity linebacker. Very true. - You get what you need? - Yeah. Tequila shots. Drinks are on me. Seriously, much appreciated. Anything for Chris. Cheers. I would love to stay and get shit-faced with you guys, but I'm going to go see him. Appreciate it. Thanks again. Of course. I am not a terrorist. I know. Look, here's, uh... $10,000. Sorry for the trouble. Why did you do this to me? I love this country. Really? I'm not sure I do. Chris. Chris, it's Ellen. I have some good news... Hello? Hello? Chris? Hello? Hey. Hey, Ghwarri. Hello. Hello. Where's Chris? Where's Chris? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck is that? Possible IED on the right. I'm going to check it out. Yeah. We're here. So what do we do now, look for some mullah that doesn't exist? Let him chase his tail for awhile. Okay, but, sir, he doesn't necessarily believe Boorman's story. As long as he's over there, we're fine for now. Copy that. We good? All good. Let's do it. Hope that kid's going to be okay over there. You're going to hear tomorrow, but a few congressmen have decided to change their votes. Congratulations. Your contracts-- Looks like they'll be renewed after all. I appreciate it, Jerry. See how it all works out when, uh, when we do things my way?
