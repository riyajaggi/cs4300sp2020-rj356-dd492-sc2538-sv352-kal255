 (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) I'm not going back to the university. We're going to the West to freedom. Oh, no. It's the very best thing for us, son. I won't leave. If he's gonna fight us, our chances of escape drop from fair to zero. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I'm gonna have to tie you up. I don't want to leave here. What are you trying to do, get us killed?

 I've got a blowout in damper three. SR-71 PILOT: Get your pitch to zero. Pitch is out. I can't hold altitude! B-52 PILOT: Correction. Alpha Hold is off. Threat selector is emergency. Flight Com. I can't hold it! She's breaking up! She's breaking... ANNOUNCER: Steve Austin. Astronaut. A man barely alive. Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man. Steve Austin will be that man. Better than he was before. Better, stronger, faster. (MAIN TITLE THEME) lam aware, Mr. Goldman, that you consider my brother a traitor. Well, anybody who defects to the other side, Ms. Jackson... is usually considered that. And it means nothing that he now wants to return? Now why has your brother decided that after 15 years... he now wants to return to this country? Alexis 14... and Leon has come to believe that the boy is stifled... in the society they live in. Why should we risk this venture just to realize your brother's dream? You know what valuable research my brother has done in solar energy. For the other side. His knowledge is invaluable to both sides. Right now he's at a research center set up specifically for his experiments. A heavily guarded research center. We understand that his work will be completed Wednesday. That doesn't give us much time. You understand, of course, that if your brother does return to this country... he may face a long prison term. He is still willing to give you all the information you want about his work. OSCAR: Steve, Leon Jackson, a world expert in solar energy... and his son, Alex, are scheduled to be returned to the interior... at noon on Wednesday. You will be taken by Army transport to within 80 miles of the Darwish Forest. From there you'll be ﬂown by private plane just before dawn... to within five miles of the mansion where they're holding the Jacksons. The house is hidden away in a valley marked on your map. It's guarded by a detachment of 25 secret police... commanded by a Captain Ledven. The paved roads around the mansions are monitored with sensor rays... which you'll be able to see with your bionic eye. The area to the east is not monitored, but is heavily mines and impassable. The only escape route possible is to get the Jacksons... to the abandoned mine shaft to the northwest... which passes under the Finnish border. We've gotten a message to Leon Jackson that you're on your way. Good luck, pal. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Father! What are you doing up so early? Oh, I have to make ready for our journey. It is good to be going home, isn't it? Yes. Where are you going? To visit Boris. He gets off duty in half an hour. Not this morning. This morning I want you here. ALEX: But I always visit with Boris in the morning. I said I want you here! But why? I have nothing to do. I'm all packed. Well, it's just... we might be leaving sooner than scheduled. Before noon? LEON: Yes, possible. Then I must say goodbye to Boris. It'll be my last chance. Yes, all right, go and see your friend. But just for a few minutes and then I want you back here. Yes, sir. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Boris! And how are you this morning, my friend. Feel good. Good. All ready for your trip home? Yes. Only my father says we might be leaving early. Oh? I've heard of no change in plans. He's been acting very strangely this morning. He spoke very sharply to me. Now don't complain to me about your father, young man. Remember what I've told you... I know, I know. My father is a very busy, very important man... and if he doesn't have time for me, it's because he works so hard for the party. Very good. Boris, I still wish... Oh, not that again, Alex. You have me for a friend. Why would you want me for a father? Come on, walk with me. I have my rounds to make. Boris? What? Tell me of the battle. Again? Please? Well, our tank was in the lead... And so we destroyed them and moved on. (LAUGHS) I think by now you must know that story as well as I do. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) GUARD (V. 0.): Post number seven, sound the alarm. (DYNAMIC MUSIC) (ALARM SOUNDING) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) Gottke! What were you shooting at? A man! An intruder! Where? I don't know. He jumped over the fence and ran into the bushes. Gottke claims he shot at a man who jumped over the fence. Jumped over? Gottke, that fence is 12 feet high. I know, Captain, but I saw him, I did. One minute I had him right in my sights... and the next minute he was gone! I warned you about this, Gottke. Tell you, I saw him. The discipline committee will take care of your blurred vision. Shut off that alarm. You better go back inside, young man. Yes, sir. Sergeant, take care of this man. Yes, sir. Captain, l have not been drinking. I know what I saw. I saw him. Probably saw a deer. But you men stay here on duty, just in case. Alex, I heard a shot! What happened? It was just Gottke. He's seeing things again. What did he see? He claims he saw a man jumping the fence. But they didn't believe him. You know Gottke. Ah. Good. Now, I want you to go into your room. I want you to put on your hiking boots. What for? I told you, we might be leaving a little early. But Boris said there'd be no change in... Boris is not your father, I am. You'll do what I say! Yes, sir. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) LEON: Austin? Doctor. Thank God you've come. Away from the window. What are our chances? They're fair, as long as you haven't told anyone you're planning to leave the country. No one. Not even my son. Well, I think you better tell him. I will. Well, the tunnel's been dug under the border. We'll use one of their Jeeps to get there. But the roads are lined with electronic eyes. They'll know where we are. Well, we'll just have to stay ahead of them. (DOOR OPENS) Son... this is Colonel Austin. How do you do, Colonel. My son, Alex. Alex. ALEX: Did you come to take us home? Uh... Alex, I'm not going back to the University. We're not going home. Why not? We're going to the West to freedom. Oh, no... no! It's the very best thing for us, son. I have heard of others who run away. They are traitors. We are not traitors. We're simply seeking freedom. LEON: I know what's best. Not for me, only for yourself! You care only of yourself! That's enough! You never think of me, not like Boris. He cares about me. You care only about your work. I won't leave... I won't! You will do exactly what I tell you. Do you understand me? Exactly what I tell you. Okay. He's gotten friendly with one of the security guards, that's all it is. If he's going to fight us, our chances of escape drop from fair to zero. Don't worry. Alex is a good boy. He'll obey me. Okay. Now we're taking nothing with us except this satchel. That's good. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Let's go. Good morning, Doctor, what are you... (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) According to the schedule, no more guards 'till we get outside. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (LOUD CRASH) Alex! Boris! (TIRES SCREECHING) Who's in that Jeep? It looks like the doctor! Don't fire. You might hit the boy! CAPTAIN: After them! I've alerted the guards at the bridge, sir. Good. The electric beam hasn't been broken. They're not on the main road yet. Get me the Sergeant. There's no way they're gonna escape alive. What's happened? I don't know. I'll take a look. What's wrong? Well, our radiator's punctured. Must have happened during the crash-out. We'll have to go through the woods on foot. We've got so far to go. We've got no choice, the radiator's dry. You get started, Leon, I'll catch you in a minute. Am I gonna have to tie you up? I don't want to leave here. What are you trying to do, get us killed? You maybe, but they wouldn't kill us. Look, I don't have time to give you a political education. I don't want your education, or your country. My father lives, breathes his work. It's as though I didn't exist. The only friend I have, the only people I know are here. The fact is whether you believe it or not, he's risking his life to take you with him... and I want your word you won't do anything to get us caught. All right. I mean it, Alex. You would trust me after what I did? All I can go on is your word. You have my word. But I hope they catch us. I won't lie about that. Fair enough. Come on. MAN ON RADIO: Any sign of them yet? No, sir. Nothing yet. Wait, Doctor. There are electronic eyes. (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) Just do as I do. (DEVICE BEEPING) Watch it! Be careful. (DEVICE BEEPING) Okay, you hang on to him. Head that way as fast as you can. I'll catch up to you. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Colonel... can we stop and rest? STEVE: Yeah, when we get around the lake to the base of that hill. Here, let me take that. No! I'm sorry. You see, it's just that... for years I wan't able to trust anyone. You understand, don't you? Sure. Let's go. Come on, you men, get out there! Captain, it looks like they skidded over the cliff. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Right, sir. Captain thinks it might be another trick. Take a couple of men. Cover the woods on foot. You two turn around and go back up the firebreak. See if you can head them off that way. The rest of you come with me. Go up the main road. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) You better sit down for a few minutes and get all the rest you can. Okay. Alex, sit down by your father. I'm not tired. Look, I think it'd be a good idea if you sat down anyway. Keep your eye on him. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) LEON: Colonel? I don't think I can make that hill. Alright, we'll go around. (BREATHING HEAW) I'm gonna backtrack, try and leave a phony trail. Throw them off a little bit. Y'all wait here. Alex, try to understand. I understand you don't care about what I want! You're not old enough yet to know what you want. How would you know? You're never around! Alex, I'm doing this for you. You're doing this for yourself! I want to stay here. You don't know what it's like in the West. I don't want to. Alex! Alex! LEON: Alex, stop! Alex! Alex, stop! (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) There! That's him. Where's your father? We didn't want to go! Colonel Austin made us do it. I said where's your father? Leave him alone! (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (WOOD CREAKING) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) Father? Father! Father. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) You alright? I can't see. I can't see. It's my fault. I broke my promise. I heard the guards coming and I ran to them. They hit him and now he's blind. It's my fault. I will never make it now. Can you see anything, Doctor? Anything at all? No. We were so close. We'll never make it. Well, there's a storage shed further down the road. I'll get you there and fix you up. Get in the Jeep. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (MOANS) Felix, he's over there. Captain. Captain, this is Boris. Our men have been attacked. Their Jeep is missing. What's your location, Boris? Then get moving! Try to follow that Jeep. We'll get them, sir. They've just been lucky. And their luck has just ran out. The line they're following leads to this worked out mine on the border. I need my vehicle and some more men. Bring the satchel, Alex. Yes, sir. (METAL CREAKING) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) This way, Doctor. Sit you down right here. Alex, see if that pump works. We'll need some water. The pump handle is tied down. I can't get it loose. Use your head, Alex. You have a knife, cut it loose. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (METAL CREAKING) See if you can dampen that. It's good. The bleeding stopped. Now to check your eyes. (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) It looks like they're dialating like they're supposed to. Chances are your blindness is only temporary. Colonel, you're no physician. No, but I've seen enough concussion-induced blindness... to know what I'm talking about. A few days in the hospital and you'll be as good as new. I'll never get to the hospital. We'll never even make it to the border. Oh, we'll make it. Here's the gauze. Yeah, clean his wound. No, I'd rather have the Colonel do it. Look, I don't know what's going on between you two... but if we are gonna get out of here alive, we're all gonna have to work together. STEVE: You know, Leon, you treat your son here... like he's some kind of scientific wonder you've created, that you just order around. But you don't really talk to him... don't explain what you're doing or what you're feeling. He is your son. Do you know what a wonderful thing that is to have a son? And you, Alex... You treat your father like he's the enemy... I don't know where your mother is, but you both sure could use her. She died when I was born. Well, then, I guess all you two have got left in the world is each other. I have one friend. His name is Boris. He cares about me. It's not the same, Alex. One of these days you'll find that out. Bandage your father's head. But he said... I said bandage it! ALEX: Where are you going? Right outside. I'll watch the door. Alex? Alex, are you still here? I'm here. We may not get out of this, Alex. In which case I am sorry for the trouble I've caused you. But you can tell them you weren't a part of it. It doesn't really matter what happens to me anymore. What will they do? LEON: It's hard to say. Will you go to prison? At least that. But Boris, he will look after you. LEON: Boris is a good man. No, I... I think I was always a little jealous of how well you two got along together. Jealous? I just want you to know, Alex, that... I love you. I love you very much. I know I haven't often shown that to you, but I do. You know, it's strange, in all this... all this sudden darkness, all I can seem to see is... your handsome, young face. You think my face is handsome? Yes, you're a very handsome boy. But you never once told me... Ever since you were born, all I thought about was my work. Work! I was trying to forget, I suppose... my great mistake. Mistake, Father? I turned my back on my own country. For a woman I loved very much. It was very painful, Alex. Our love and what it cost. I met her 15 years ago... at an International Science Conference. I represented my country, she represented hers. Loved that woman from the first moment we met. That's why you left your country? Yes. That's why. When did she die, when I was born? Why didn't you leave then? It was my great mistake. Fear of going to jail, guilt, I don't know... it seems simpler to block out my feelings with work. Unfortunately, I blocked you out of my life as well. But why would you want to leave now? After so many years? LEON: For you, Alex. I suddenly realized what all my neglect had caused. A young man who thought only as the State wished him to think. I'm to blame for that, Alex. I wanted to finally do something for you. I wanted... Well... Doesn't matter now. But I had to try.... (STEPS APPROACHING) We can't stay here any longer. Are you strong enough to move on, Doctor? I can try. Bring your father, Alex. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Why'd we stop? The other side of this hill is a valley where there's a worked-out mine. That's our destination. A mine? The tunnel has been extended across the border. We reach that, we're home free. Let's go. Well according to this map, the entrance to the mine should be... there. (VEHICLES APPROACHING) (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) Can you see it, Colonel? The mine! It's no use, Doctor. They've gotten there ahead of us. Where are we now? Back at the storage shed. LEON: Can we hide here? No. I came back to get some equipment. Equipment? Yeah, I saw some lines inside and a grappling hook. A mile north of here is a gorge. Colonel, be realistic. I can't be expected to cross a gorge. Not without my sight. Doctor, the other side of that gorge is freedom. And that's where we're headed. I'll be right back. Optimistic man, our Colonel Austin. A brave man. You know, I think it's a good idea we leave the Jeep here... so they can't follow our tracks. Alex, I saw some barrels of sand inside. See if you can roll one out for me, huh? Yes, sir. Everything'll be alright, Doctor. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (METAL CREAKING) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) I found the barrel, but it's too heavy. I can't lift it. I'll go get it. You help your dad out of the Jeep. Bring the satchel. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) We're at the gorge, Father. How do you expect us to get across, Colonel? On my back. One at a time. No, I'm too heavy. Just take my son. We'll manage, Doctor. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (HOOK CLANGS) That rope should hold. Why did you bring the barrel, Colonel? To help me create a little diversion. A diversion? STEVE: They're bound to be looking in this area. I don't want them coming on us while we're halfway across. Well, what can you do? There's a mine field east of here. If they think we're trapped in that field, that'll give us time while they investigate. Alex, I'm gonna have to leave you here with your father for a awhile. Yes, sir. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) I won't be long. Hm. One of them is wounded. That should slow them down. Let's take the Jeep. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (DISTANT EXPLOSIONS) The mine field. It could be a trick. You two move over to the field. I'll meet you back at the shed. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) We heard the explosions. Yeah, let's hope the guards did too. Okay, we're going across. Take my father first. No. But you won't be safe here, Father, alone. If we leave you here, Alex, you may be tempted to run back to Boris again. If Alex wants to get away from you, Dr. Jackson, he'll have lots of other chances. He may as well face up to what he wants to do right now. Very well. Come on, Doctor. Okay, climb on my back. Hold on tight. Are you set? (ROPE CREAKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) Alex! Boris! Are you alright? Some of the guards found us. They hit father. He can't see, Boris, he's blind. He was doing it for me, Boris. My father wants me to live in his country. And you, Alex? I don't want to leave. A small boy like you shouldn't have such problems to worry about. Who is this man that wants to take your father and you away? Colonel Austin. He's a fair man, Boris. (ROPE CREAKING) Bring Dr. Jackson back to this side. He's happy where he is. If he wants his son, he'll learn to be happy on this side. Boris, what are you doing? My duty.... But we're friends. You don't have to force me to stay. Some day you'll understand. Bring the doctor back... now! No, Boris! No! (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) You ready? Yes, sir. Let's go. I couldn't've been wrong about him. ALEX: He is my friend. Alex! Have a good life, my friend! Okay. Have a good life! Goodbye, Boris Good bye! You're right. You've got a good friend. (DYNAMIC MUSIC) Hello, Alex. Hello, Colonel. It's Steve. Steve. It's beautiful. It sure is. Handles like a dream. I've flown it. You are a pilot, too? That's right. I would like to be a pilot. Well, maybe one of these days you can. You know, Alex, over here you can be anything you want to be. If you want to do it badly enough. Where's my father now? He and Oscar are still in with the Secretary. They'll be in in a minute. I was so happy when the doctor removed the bandages from his eyes... and he could see. You were right about the blindness. But now... will he have to go to prison? For running away from his country so long ago? I don't know. I'm taking you to your Aunt Edna's home now, Alex. Will you be leaving me there? No, son. I'll be staying with you. The Secretary decided there were extenuating circumstances in this case. And, since Dr. Jackson was turning over valuable information to us... he's going to be put on probation. Congratulations, Doctor. Thank you, Colonel Austin. Thank you for everything. And now, Doctor, if you'd be good enough to come with me... I'd like to talk to you about those papers. I'd like to look them over. You know, Alex, I've got a little present for you. A present? Yeah, I... I think you lost this. I don't know how to thank you, Steve. (END THEME MUSIC)
