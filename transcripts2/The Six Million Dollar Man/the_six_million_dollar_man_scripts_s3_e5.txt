 We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man. Steve Austin will be that man. Better than he was before. Better, stronger, faster. (MAIN TITLE THEME) KURODA: Good evening. My name is Kuroda. I came here to see Mr. Ishikawa. RECEPTIONIST: Go right in. Mr. Ishikawa is expecting you. Ah, Kuroda, come in. Thank you for coming. Sit down. How may I serve you, sir? How would you like a brief vacation from your work? I've already had my annual vacation, sir. Yes, but this is different. You have read the reports of a wolf child in the forest of Hoyoko? Oh, yes... in the newspapers. I have been asked by a certain government official... to have you lead a search party for this wolf child. I would be most honored to serve you in this way. If you don't find this wild creature who runs with wolves... there is no shame, Kuroda, for I doubt that he exists. But I know you'll try your best. I will, sir. I'll tell my secretary what men you wish to take with you... and what supplies you will need. I need only one man to help me, sir. One man? KURODA: Yes, sir. The man who brought me out of the Philippine jungle... the astronaut, my friend, Colonel Steve Austin. OSCAR: Japan?! (COUGHS) STEVE: Take it easy, Oscar. OSCAR: What do you mean you're going to Japan? Well, I got a telegram from Kuroda, he needs my help. Doing what? Trying to locate a... wolf boy in a forest... Steve... do you have any idea how much they've asked me to cut out of this budget? Do you have any idea at all? Oscar... Let me tell you. $570,000, that's how much. And I don't know where I'm gonna take it out of. I've got to take it out of somewhere. I'm gonna take it out of long distance phone calls. I'm gonna take it out of travel. Yeah, but there is a wrinkle that might interest you. You see, the word is that this boy may not be Asian. Well, why should that interest me? Well, the way I see it, this wolf boy... it could be the missing son of Ambassador Emerson. Steve... the official word is that Ambassador Emerson, his wife and his son... were accidentally killed ten years ago in northern Japan. Yes, but the boy's body was never found... and according to the State Department investigations... there was nothing accidental about the parents' death. OSCAR: Where'd you get this? I took the liberty of having a computer print-out on all the American children... known missing in Japan in the last ten years. The computer came up with Gary Emerson's name. This is a picture of Gary when he was about three. So you want to go all the way to Japan... to see if you can find this... this what do you call it? This wolf boy? Look, I know it sounds a little far-fetched... Far-fetched? It's preposterous. Ridiculous would be a little closer. Kuroda is a pretty level-headed guy. All right, Steve, you've been through a lot with him, you're fond of him... and you'd like to help him find this wolf boy. So in order to justify your trip to the Orient, you dug out this old Emerson file, right? Oscar, Gary Emerson was the only name the computer came up with. What do you say? A week. You've got a week. Thanks, Oscar. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) OSCAR: His name is Kuroda. He's one of those Japanese soldiers hidden away in the Philippine jungles... who believes World War II is still on. A half-crazed man, a dangerous... He's more animal than man and you've got to find him, Steve. These rockets are so powerful that they fly men through space all the way to the moon. (LAUGHS) Look, I've been up there. I've stood on the moon and looked back at the earth. You fly to space? To the moon? Look, I know it's a little hard for you to believe. You're biggest liar on earth. That's what I believe. Move! The United States invented the atomic bomb. A powerful bomb that could destroy a whole city with one explosion. At the time, it seemed the best way to stop the war was... drop the atomic bomb. No bomb destroy Japan's cities! Japan not surrender! Your Emperor chose life for the Japanese people. You insult me. This information to make me surrender. KURODA: Lies. Lies. Japan fight... for one hundred years... for one thousand. You have military objective. I let you live only to find it out. What kind of a devil are you? I'm a man, just like you. This leg is like a machine. That's how far we've progressed. You have shown that you know how to die. Now for the sake of your enemy, show me that you know how to live. Kuroda, I can't accept your 1000-stitch belt. It represents your life. It's only thing left I value. Please accept. You came. I'm glad. How are you, my friend? I did not expect you so soon. Well, that cab I took must of had a good tail wind. In Tokyo, still have Kamikaze. That what they call taxi driver. (LAUGHS) How long before you finish here? I explain to manager already. If there is train, we go to Hoyoko tonight. What does this mean? It's a "See me about special price on suede shoes." I'm so glad to be getting away from this shoe store... just for a little while... I can't tell you how happy I am. Who financed this hunt? Shige lshikawa... very rich, have many factories and business. He is also considered a scholar. It's okay with him that I came along? He was very pleased that such an important American as you... would be willing to come along. Is he your friend? Oh, no, no. When I return to Japan, l have no friend... no trade... nothing but family. Ishikawa gave me work... and when my mother was ill... he took care of everything. So he's your benefactor? Yes. lam in his debt for the rest of my life. Well, I hope it takes you fifty years to pay him back. (MILITARY MUSIC) (BOAT HORN SOUNDS) I remember being on the short end of that once before. I carry on island... so long, not comfortable without. Hey? You want this? I never was much into rifles... even the tranquilizer kind. You know, Kuroda, there's something I haven't told you. This may be a long shot, but... the wolf boy we're looking for may be the son of an American diplomat... who disappeared ten years ago. That's another reason why you came? Yes. I'm still honored by your presence. This way. Let's try north. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Looks like it was made when the ground was wet. Here after last rain... four days ago. But it could be just timber men looking for next trees to cut. (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Wolf trap. The timber men are after more than timber. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) I don't know. I just don't know. What's troubling you, friend? I have no skill in the art of selling shoes. Everybody knows this. Everyone knows that I am being paid every week... only because Ishikawa owns the store. But here I can understand the world. But back in the city... I am lost. I don't understand how anything works. Computers... atomic energy... stocks and bonds... Everything is electronic nowadays. Forgive me. I meant no offense. Well, it's good to get it off your chest. I know how hard it must be for you. Thank you for understanding. Look here! Steve! STEVE: Well, what do you know? You see! This might be a wolf boy. Now all we have to do is find him. Find camp first. Dark soon. Right. This way. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) They are at the edge of the mountain now. They? I thought just Kuroda was tracking the wolf boy. Kuroda has an American help him. Ah, no problem. Make sure they don't know you are following him. No, no, we'll just look like hunters out in the woods. I don't know if there is a wolf boy... but if they find one, see to it they do not bring him back. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) I feel good today. Much better. My shoe store is far away. You know, I'm not as strong as I was a year ago... but today I am happy. What do you mean, not as strong? I was watching you climbing that trail. You still move around like a billy goat. But not so fast as you. I am too old to be chasing on foot. You know, might find boy... but never catch. With your legs, I thought... (WOLVES FIGHTING) Wolves fighting. Wolf boy could be near. (WOLVES FIGHTING) (GROWLING AND WHIMPERING) (GROWLING, WHIMPERING CEASE) (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) (DISTANT SOBBING) (SOBBING CONTINUES) (SOBBING) She-wolf was his mother in forest. He more wolf than human now. Hard to catch. I'll circle around behind him. When I give you a signal, we'll move in slow. (SOBBING) (GROWLING) We just want to help you. Oi. Shonen. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Take it easy... Easy now. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) KURODA: How bad? His heart's racing, but he'll be okay. It's incredible he could have survived all these years. He sound like wolf. Little wolf... I take she-wolf and bury her somewhere deep. Wolf boy may want to stay with her. I'll set up camp near the stream. I hoped little wolf boy was Japanese, so I could talk to him... like a father. I doubt if he talks at all living away from people all these years. I can do something for him. I'll make pants for wolf boy with my shirt. In the city, boy must wear pants, even wolf boy. KURODA: Wolf boy... what secrets have you learned from the wolf? What do you remember of your life with people? (CHIMES) STEVE: How's the boy now? KURODA He's not as hot... better than before. If he's the American boy you're looking for, what's his name? Gary... Gary Emerson. KURODA: Gary... Gary. That nice name. You know, sometimes when wild animals are captured, they go into shock. Shock? They get so frightened, they faint. Rest easy, wolf boy. Tomorrow, if he's feels any better I give him bath. Then teach him some words. Take a long time to make him understand he's like you and me. He thinks he's the last of his kind... like me. You've got a point. I watch the boy. You go sleep first. Wake me in a couple of hours, huh? Sure. (DISTANT HOWLING) (DISTANT HOWLING CONTINUES) Gary! (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) Well, he's gone. My fault. You were tired. That's all. It'll be daylight in a couple of hours. We'll pick up his trail then. You get some sleep. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) MASTERS: We don't need them to find the boy. Get that charge ready. Wolf... might be looking for food on this deer trail. MASTERS: Now. (DISTANT EXPLOSION) Steve! Falling boulders a common thing around here? Sometimes. But that was too close. Yeah, you can say that again. (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) Lead on. Agh! Nothing! We'll just have to keep looking until we find something. (RUSTLING) Boy could be far away... or dead... because I went to sleep. Stop kicking yourself. KURODA: And wolf boy ran away... we'll never find him again. (GROWLS) He came back! Well, maybe he didn't have any place else to go. He knows forest. He knows way around. Yeah, but he's never had to go it alone. He came back for something. Food, probably... She-wolf was the hunter... he waits to be fed. What's that? Sushi. Rice and seaweed. Smells like raw fish. That too! (SOFTLY GROWLS) KURODA: Show him, Steve. Show him how to eat, Steve. (SNIFFS) Maybe he'll like it. (SNIFFS) Smart boy. (CHIMES) (MILITARY MUSIC) Hmm, that's a pretty smart idea. Try it now. (FLUTE PLAYING) What's that? It's a picture of Gary when he was about three. KURODA: Ah! (SHRIEKS) Gary, I'm just trying to help you. Understand what I'm saying? Gary? MOTHER'S VOICE: Gary? Gary! Gary, darling, where are you? Gary. Gary... Let me have your hand, Gary. Geh... ry. He's trying to talk. He's trying... That's right, that's you're name, isn't it? Gary. STEVE: That's your name. Gary. Geh... ree... Geh... ree... (LAUGHS) (MILITARY MUSIC) He smart boy. Sure is. Maybe he not like his life in the city? I don't know. Must be a quicker way out of here. You'd like to stay here with him in the forest, wouldn't you? Yes. But you are right. We should get the boy back quickly. Well, maybe you can spend some time with him later. You two stay here. I'm gonna scout around. I'll be right back. (PLAYS FLUTE) (SIGHS) Must he patient. Maybe it is a little game you play, huh? Okay. KURODA: Ow! Don't go, Gary. Stay here with me! Yes... Good boy... Good boy... KURODA: We are friends... here together. We are safe together. I found a path that will get us to the Jeep by dark. You found another trap, huh? Accident. (CREAKING) (GROANS) (TRAP SNAPS) How is it? Think you can make it? Bushido say pain make best crutch. I asked how your foot was, not for a lesson in philosophy. I can walk. Here you go. MASTERS: Good. But you're not going very far, I'm afraid. (GROWLING) Okami-chan! (SPEAKING JAPANESE) "Little wolf." Well, isn't that touching... and poetic... and so Japanese. What do you want? We got it... thanks to you. (GROWLS) Throw your gear over here. Colonel Austin... O.S.l. And you obviously know this is the Emerson boy. (WOLF BOY GROWLS) Who sent you to follow us? It was your benefactor, Ishikawa. He's the only one that knew. Why Ishikawa? Why he want the boy? Why? Unfortunately, he saw Ishikawa kill the Emersons. What?! Ishikawa is very old-fashioned. He believes in Japan for the Japanese... Toshio, get rid of them! (IN JAPANESE) Ishikawa said nothing about killing them. I don't care what he said. You get rid of them. I'll take care of the boy. Let him go. Come on. Pick it up. Atta' boy. Thanks for your help... Colonel! (IN JAPANESE) You better kill the man as well. You idiot! You will not live long! (IN JAPANESE) You're out of date, old man. There's no place for Samurai in Japan now. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) They're on the same path we took coming up here. This'll make them think they got no reason to hurry. (GUN SHOTS) (DISTANT GUN SHOTS) Come on, little friend. Not long now. Yeah, this is good. We can make it look like an accident here. Here. Give him some food. Just drop it. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) MOTHER'S VOICE: They're trying to hurt us. Run, Gary! Run! (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) MOTHER'S VOICE: Run, Gary! Run! (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) MOTHER'S VOICE: Gary! Run! (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) Put him down here. Here. Right here. You'll be alright, Gary. You'll be alright. (MILITARY MUSIC) You know, Steve... Ishikawa really believed killing an American diplomat... would attract others to his cause. Well, what was his cause?‘ To make Japan a military power again. What about the American that was working with Ishikawa? He'll be extradited. You know we got 45 minutes to catch that plane? You'd better get the boy. You know, Oscar, I've been thinking... I think it's a mistake sending the boy back to the States. Why? I think it's wrong that we expect him to adjust from the forest... to the modern world just like that. But, Steve, I've got a team of child psychologists... in Washington ready to treat him. Well, that's fine, but what do you say we give the boy some time... on his own to try and adjust? And after a few months, let the specialists come here and treat him. Hmm... and in the meantime? In the meanwhile, let's consider the boy and what would be best for him. Well, perhaps, it might be good for him. You go home now... to city... be famous. I don't think you like that any better than Kuroda. You belong in woods, not in concrete buildings. If I had to do it over, I would never bring you out. But you have courage. You will learn. Sah. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) He's going to have a hard time finding a teacher for that in the States. Gary a bright boy. He will learn on his own. STEVE: He'd learn a lot faster if you taught him. But he goes to America. Not if you want to take him back into the forest. KURODA: American government won't allow. You know, Kuroda, you've been telling me how hard it is for you to adjust to city life. Imagine how hard it's gonna be for him. You mean Gary and I can go back? Live in forest? For a few months, and we'll see how it works out. Oscar's agreed that it's the best thing for the boy. After a while, we'll send some specialists here to work with Gary... help him back into civilization. You've given me the most wonderful gift I could get in this world. (CHIMES) (END THEME MUSIC)
