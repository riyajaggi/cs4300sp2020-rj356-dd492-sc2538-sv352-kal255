 Steve Austin takes the recuperating Jaime Sommers to their hometown of Ojai in an attempt to jog her memory. Unfortunately this only results in her getting violent headaches and confusing flashbacks.

It's Jaime. She's alive.

 ANNOUNCER: Doctor Michael Marchetti had performed a startling operation... using revolutionary cryogenic techniques... which had literally brought Jaime back to life. (DEFIBRILLATOR CLICKS) ANNOUNCER: But when Jaime saw Steve again... Who are you? ANNOUNCER: Jaime had suffered brain damage. Her memory was gone. I told you before, by attempting to stimulate Jaime's memory... we could bring back the pain that she felt so intensely. Then it's best that she doesn't know anything about us. What we shared. ANNOUNCER: Steve could only watch as Jaime grew closer to Michael. Then Jaime began to have ﬂashes of memory...

 but with the memory came pain. What's the matter? Steve, sometimes I feel like I'm just on the edge of remembering... and then... and then it hurts. And it's so frustrating, cause I... It's driving me crazy. ANNOUNCER: So they considered taking Jaime back to her hometown. Just suppose somebody comes up on the street and recognizes her. We'll have to avoid that. Keep her off the streets. Keep the whole thing controlled. ANNOUNCER: Now Steve is taking Jaime home... but no one knows what lies ahead. ANNOUNCER: And now the Return of The Bionic Woman, Part Two... on The Six Million Dollar Man. FLIGHT COM: It's looks good at NASA One. B- 52 >PILOT: Roger. BCS Arm switch is on. FLIGHT COM: Okay, Victor. B-52 PILOT: Landing Rocket Arm switch is on. Here comes the throttle. Circuit breakers in. STEVE: We have separation. B-52 PILOT: Inboard and outboards are on. I'm comin' forward with the side stick. FLIGHT COM: Looks good. PILOT: Ah, Roger. STEVE: I've got a blowout in damper three. SR-71 PILOT: Get your pitch to zero. STEVE: Pitch is out. I can't hold altitude! B-52 PILOT: Correction. Alpha Hold is off. Threat selector is emergency. STEVE: Flight Com. I can't hold it! She's breaking up! She's breaking... ANNOUNCER: Steve Austin. Astronaut. A man barely alive. Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to make the world's first bionic man. Steve Austin will be that man. Better than he was before. Better, stronger, faster. (MAIN TITLE THEME) ('7OS POP MUSIC) It's beautiful country, Steve. Yeah, I've always thought so. You know this country pretty well, huh? Well, I was raised here. What did that sign say? It said, Astronaut Steve Austin? Yeah. You didn't tell me that. Did you go into space? Well, I went to the moon. The moon? Wow, what's it like to walk around on a strange new world? Never mind. I think I know exactly how it feels. JAIME: So, this is your place, huh? STEVE: Yep. JAIME: Well, it suits you. It's warm and friendly just like the countryside. STEVE: Would you like to see some more? JAIME: Oh, yes. STEVE: Come on, I'll show you around. JAIME: Okay. ('7OS POP MUSIC) J‘ It's been fun, lots of laughs, Jaime J‘ I It always is when friends meet again I I But lately, it's gone ﬂat for me, Jaime J‘ J‘ I don't like seeing you now and then I J‘ Our friendship is finished I J‘ That's true J‘ I But there's hope, a way to make it through I J‘ Because, sweet Jaime, I love you I J‘ I never wanna say goodbye to you I J‘ Sweet Jaime, I'll love you foreverJ‘ J‘ I know we'll never part I J‘ I love you like I loved no otherJ‘ I Make room for me in your heart I JAIME: Michael? Hi, it's Jaime. I just wanted to call you and let you know we got here. I'm glad to hear it. How are you feeling? Good. We're at Steve's ranch now. And it's just... it's really, uh... (LOUD WHOOSH & CHIMES) It's really... MICHAEL: Jaime? Yeah, I'm here. You're sure you're not having any problems? No, no problems. No problem except that you're not here. When are you coming up? Oh, good. Maybe we can have breakfast then, huh? Oh, that would be lovely. Um, Michael? What is it? I'll tell you tomorrow. Maybe. Bye bye. (HANGS UP) (LOUD WHOOSH) Could we go for a walk? Sure. Don't you want your orange juice? Not right now. Oh, it's just so peaceful here. Yep. Steve, you're my friend. Tell me something honestly. I'll try. What do you think of Michael? Well, he's a brilliant, talented, dedicated scientist. I know all that, but, um... what do you think of him as a person? I like him. Me too. Do you think he likes me? (LOUD WHOOSH) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) What's the matter? Nothing, I... I... You alright? Yeah. Really. This must've been a really nice place to grow up. Yeah, it was for me. I used to go fishing just over that hill there. Is there a lake near here? Yeah. Just over that hill there. Can we go there? Sure, I guess so. Did you ever get the feeling that you've been somewhere before? Sure. Lots of times. Kind of feel that way now. Guess I'll probably feel that way off and on for the rest of my life. Hey, can we go into town? Well, there's not much to see there. Well, I would like to go anyway. So plan on it. Well, maybe. Gee, aren't these fun? Kind of makes you feel like someone's been here before. Yeah. Is your name on here? No, no. I don't think so. You know what I'd like to do? What's that? (DRILLING SOUND) What every woman wants: a bionic fingernail. (DRILLING SOUND) (CHIMES) (CHIMES) (DIALS ROTARY PHONE) (PHONE RINGING) Hello? STEVE: Hi, Dad. Steve! Where are you? Well, I'm here. At the ranch. Oh, your mother will be so disappointed. She's at your Aunt Berdine's in Bakersfield. You be here long? Well, I don't know. Can you come over? Sure. What's wrong? I need to talk to you, Dad. There's something you better know before you get here. What is it? It's about Jaime. (CHIMES) STEVE'S DAD: It's unreal, Steve. Like I'm seeing a ghost. STEVE: Yeah, I know. STEVE'S DAD: And she hasn't remembered anything? Even since you brought her here? STEVE: No, and there's a constant danger that if she sees too much... or accidentally heard too much from someone in town... it might seriously damage her psychologically. So I've really got to keep her clear of town. This must be harder for you than I can even imagine. That's why I called you. I just had to have somebody to talk to. (POURS DRINK) It is getting to me, Dad. Taking her to all the places she and I used to go as kids. Places we went again last spring. Seems so long ago now. I guess that's what hurts the most. Finding her last spring and then... realizing what we'd been missing all those years. Coming so close to marrying her. Then losing her that night at the hospital. And now? Now, losing her all over again. Yeah. Dad, this morning out by the lake, I... I just wanted to grab her and... And make her remember me. Remember us. You're pretty remarkable. Do you know that? You've been so busy worrying about how Ojai would effect Jaime... that you haven't taken time to worry about how it would effect you. I guess I'll be alright. Thanks for helping me unload a little bit. It helps. I wish I could help more. Now where'd she go? Come on, let's have a look. Jaime? Jaime! Where'd she go? (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) STEVE: The back gate's open. She must be headed for town. I've gotta stop her. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) Edward! WOMAN: Edward. (BIONIC EAR SOUND EFFECT) Didn't that look like Jaime Sommers? Edward. (TENNIS PLAYERS CHATTER) (CHIMES) Hey, my game, Armando. Okay, you buy the beer, huh? Make it cold. (CHIMES) Steve? Steve Austin! Hi, Mrs. Raymond. How are you? It's very good to see you again. You know the funniest thing? We just passed a girl back there who looked just like Jaime Sommers. You did? Where? She was the spitting image. I said to Edward, didn't that look like Jaime Sommers? Mrs. Raymond, where did you see her? Oh, at the park. Thank you. I'll see you later. Hey! Hi. You want to hit a couple back? Oh. Come on. Come on. Here's an easier one. Oh. Wow. That was great. Hey. Try another one. I get the feeling I'm being hustled. Hey, I am being hustled. You're Jaime Sommers. Yeah, I saw you on TV last year. When was that? In the finals last spring. (LOUD WHOOSH) Hey, you were some kind of player. You living in Ojai now? No. (LOUD WHOOSH) I would really like for my friends to meet you. Oh, no. It'll just take a minute. I'll be right back, okay? (LOUD WHOOSH) No! (HIGH-PITCHED TONE & CHIMES) STEVE: Jaime? Jaime. Oh, Steve, I... it hurts. I remembered so much pain. Come on. I was a tennis player? He said... he said that... Yeah. I had a flash of memory, but there was a pain with it. It was like a hot knife cutting and... I wish Michael was here. We'll call him. Come on. (DOOR OPENS) Hey, get a good night's rest, huh? I'll pick you up for the breakfast in the morning, okay? Michael will be here? Yeah. Goodnight. Goodnight. RECEPTIONIST: Phone call for Colonel Austin. Colonel Austin. STEVE'S DAD: Steve? You found her okay? Oh, Hi, Dad. Yeah, I, uh... I found her. Good. I was pretty worried about her. And I'm still pretty worried about you. Oh, I'll be okay. Thanks again, you know, Dad? I know, and Steve... I can't remember ever being more proud of you, son. Do you think she'll be alright now? Yes, she's, uh... she's resting quietly. Good. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LOUD WHOOSH, CHIMES) (SCREAMS) No! Jaime. Jaime, what's the matter? What happened? Just more visions and pain in my head. Call Dr. Wells or Dr. Marchetti. No, it's alright. Are you sure? Yes. I know what it is. She'll be alright. I realize why you brought me here now. What do you mean? I grew up in Ojai, too, didn't I? Yeah. And I guess you thought by me seeing the area again... it would help restore my memory... but it's no good, Steve. Every time I start to think back, there's so much pain. I mean, pain I can't even tell you about. Boy, I want to look back. There's so much there. And I even feel like there's... There's someone that I left behind. Like someone that I loved, but that pain... it just keeps coming. Look, I understand. How can I help you? Help me go forward. It just hurts too much to go back. At least for now. I think I have to leave Ojai and everything that went with it. Just leave it behind. Alright. And I need more than that, Steve. I want Oscar to put me to work. Use these bionics he gave me. Jaime, I don't know. Steve, I've gotta work. I've gotta get my mind on some new things. Look, I know what you're saying, but... I know I'll be alright, Steve. Between my bionics and your friendship, and Michael's help, we can't lose. Really. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC, CHIMES) OSCAR: She's progressing at a rapid rate, isn't she? RUDY: Looks like it. Beth? Punch up the other videotapes. RUDY: Michael's cryogenic therapy has worked wonders. It's also helped us overcome her bionic rejection problem. And Michael's presence has helped a lot too. Rudy, what condition is she in? Well, if I had another month... I'd keep a close eye on her bionic neural link... Rudy. Okay, okay. It's good. It's very good. Physically, yes, but what about mentally? I have to go along with Jaime's estimate of her condition. It's accurate. Well then, you think it's just Ojai that upset her so much. Sure. What else could it have been? I also have to go along with her suggestion... that we find her something new and challenging. STEVE: Well, that's what we'll have to let her do. I suppose you've got something in mind already, huh? Yes. For both of you. It's urgent, important. Dangerous? Well, that'll give her something new to think about, right? (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) Steve, I'm feeling a little guilty, alright? I told you I wouldn't purposely undermine your relationship with Jaime, but... But you're not made of iron, huh? No, I guess I'm not. You're just so... Hey, you're talking to the guy that fell in love with her when she was eight years old. I understand. Yeah, I'm sure you do. Besides, I, uh... I haven't given up yet. I don't blame you. And I don't blame you. Okay, let's get this show on the road. Take care. I will. Come home safely. Well, I got my big brother here to make sure I do. (ENGINE STARTS) OSCAR: Here is your adversary. His name is Carlton Harris. Very dashing. He considers himself quite a lady killer too. Harris is an American national who has a huge oil refinery... on the free Caribbean Island of Melanique. Sounds real legitimate. Only trouble is he's arming a group of militants... who in return will give him more oil holdings as soon as they take power. Ah, that's very illegitimate. Melanique government has asked us to intervene... which we can't, of course, officially, because he's on foreign soil. So we're gonna do a little unofficial intervening... and 86 the weapons and munitions, huh? OSCAR: Right. Harris' security is incredibly tight. Even with your bionics, it'll take the two of you to get into the storage area... plant the charges and get out of there in one piece. Is it bad form at all at this point to tell you I'm really scared? That's okay. (BUZZER SOUNDS) STEVE: We're over the drop zone. (LOUD WHOOSH, CHIMES) (LOUD CLUNK) (BUZZES TWICE) Austin, I can't! I can't! Come on, Jaime. You can lead. No. I'll be right with you. No, I can't! Come on. (YELLS) STEVE: Steve to pilot, come in. We've landed safely, and we're on our way to the refinery. Roger, Colonel Austin. Over and out. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LOUD WHOOSH) (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE) (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) What's going on down there? There's Harris himself. (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) What is it? STEVE: Looks like some sort of relay switch. Can you pick up what they're saying? (BIONIC EAR SOUND EFFECT) HARRIS: And this will complete our security precautions. They're talking about security precautions. There's a switch just like this one... JAIME: There's a switch just like this one in the main control room. And the only way to gain entrance to the vault in munitions... is by turning both switches simultaneously. Otherwise, the booby trap charges set in the door will blow up in their faces. Oh, that's terrific. How are we gonna get in there to plant the explosives... without getting blown up at the door? I'll have to get into the control room somehow and throw the switch... while you throw that one down there at the vault. No. What're you doing? Let me handle the inside work. No way. Steve, it makes sense. Now the plant security is incredibly tight. Oscar says... I don't care what Oscar said. And he also said that Harris is a ladies man. Lady killer. I admit the "killer" part doesn't thrill me so much... but I do have a better chance at it than you do. I can tell him I'm a reporter or something. No, Jaime. Steve, I know I'm right and so do you. Now you're cute, but he's not gonna look twice at your legs. Come on, cut the kidding. Not more than five minutes ago, you had one of those... Hey, I'm fine. Really, I'm fine, Steve. Please let me do this. I gotta prove something to myself too. I mean that I can be worth something. I can be useful. Alright, alright. Okay. Let's see. It is 1:40 now. Give me until 2:20, and then flip your switch, okay? You got it. Okay. Good luck. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (LOUD WHOOSH) Jaime. (LOUD WHOOSH, CHIMES) Jaime! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Yeah, I'll check that area. Everything should be alright. I think that's just... Oh, that's it now. Miss Stroud? Hello, but please call me Jaime, okay? Of course. Jaime. My, what a lyrical name. And I, of course, am Carlton. My security guard didn't exaggerate at all. You are very, very lovely. Thank you. And I really appreciate you taking the time for this interview. Well, I'm sure the pleasure will be all mine. You know, your complex is so huge. I would really like to walk around while we talk. Is that alright? Of course, please. Come. Thank you. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) HARRIS: A very interesting view from here. JAIME: Oh, my. How did you achieve your success here on Melanique? Oh, that's very simple. Always know who your competition is or your enemies are... and then stay one step ahead of them. Oh, really? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) You know, Jaime, I'm still not sure why your readers would be interested in me. Oh, Carlton, come on. You're wealthy and you're powerful... and if I may say so, you're very attractive. Thank you. Perhaps after our little tour... you might be interested in joining me for dinner. I have a wonderful chef who would surely be delighted to surprise you. Well, actually, I could be tempted. Good. (LOUD WHOOSH) It must take a small army to operate this place. Yes, it does, but it's mostly automated. Well then, that means you have a main control room or something? Oh, yes. Excuse me, I'll show you. (LOUD WHOOSH) Follow me this way, please. Okay. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) Now this is the nerve center of the entire complex. There's a lot of controls in here. Fantastic. I don't know how you manage to know which switch does what. It's... (LOUD WHOOSH) It's incredible. And, uh, this switch. What does it do? Jaime! (LOUD WHOOSH) Jaime! (VOICE ECHOES) Jaime! Jaime! Someone's in trouble. What? Jaime? What is it? (HIGH-PITCHED TONE) It's Steve. It must be Steve. Uh... (WHOOSH, HIGH-PITCHED TONE) Steve's in trouble, and I have to get him. Jaime? Let me go! (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) Plant Security! (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) (LOUD CRUNCH) (METAL CREAKING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Steve? Jaime! Steve's in trouble and I have to get him. That way. Call the gate. Have them cut her off! Right, sir. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) Jaime! Steve! I thought you were in trouble. I heard you calling me. What? I heard you calling me in the rain. (LOUD WHOOSH) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) There! Shoot! (GUNSHOTS) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (GUNSHOTS) OSCAR: She heard you calling her in the rain? STEVE: That's right. In the rain. She must've been having some memory of the night she died. We put her out in the field too soon, Michael. Listen, the next time that you two go out... There can't be a next time, Oscar. What? Not... not with me. Not for a long time. Steve, you're just upset because the mission aborted. Oscar, we barely got away with our lives! Jaime knows that she messed up. OSCAR: She told us so. She was thinking of Ojai. She shouldn't go through that experience again. All it brought up was painful memories. We just have to not go back there again. Do you understand? It's not Ojai, Oscar. It's me. What're you talking about? Ojai was disturbing to her subconscious. Think of what I must be doing to her every time she looks at me. I'm not good for Jaime. Steve, you got it all wrong. You're too close to the problem. Oscar, you're talking to a test pilot, remember? You're talking to a man who's been trained as an objective observer. To pull back from any situation and look at it in the cold light of day. I can read my own telemetry, Oscar. In Ojai, even before that. Right here in Rudy's lab. There were times when she looked at me. I could already sense it. I could... I could feel that the sight of me was gnawing away at her subconscious. Then on the mission. There was no Ojai there. Only Jaime and me. The memories and the pain that I brought her. Intensified to such a high level by the stress situation. I am right, aren't I, Michael? Steve... Michael, forget the personal involvements. Scientist to test pilot. I am right, aren't I? I think you are. Yes. Well, what'll we do? Send her to Rudy's other complex in Colorado Springs. Away from here. Away from Ojai. OSCAR: Away from you? STEVE: Away from me. For how long? For as long as it takes. Alright, pal. I'll make the arrangements. (MELANCHOLY MUSIC) Michael? Yeah, Steve? You brought her back to life and put her in my hands again. Now I'm putting her into yours. Okay. Ready to go? Yes. Hi. I was looking for you. Did you hear that Rudy's sending me to his complex in Colorado Springs? Yeah, I heard that. He told me. It's beautiful there. Very peaceful. That's what I need. Michael's going along. But I have decided that what I need is to get to know myself... before I can be good for anyone else. I mean anyone else. So what about you? Where are you gonna be? You know Oscar. He's always finding something for me to do. I'm gonna miss you, Steve. Yeah. I, uh... miss you too. I don't know what it is... sometimes I look at you and I get a feeling like there's something more. Was there? I'm your friend, Jaime. Always was. Always will be. Bye. Bye. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (ENGINE STARTS) (END TITLE THEME)
