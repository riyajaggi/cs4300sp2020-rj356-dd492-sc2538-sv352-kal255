 (DEVICE TAPPING) Steve, that's it. You sure it won't affect my other eye? I'm positive. Thanks, Harold. Hey, Oscar, did you get it? I've got... Listen, I want to know exactly what you've been doing here all night? Let's see that. It's incredible, Oscar... a micro-processing unit assembled on a single silicone chip. No bigger than a grain of rice... (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) it contains 5,400 transistors... and is capable of performing 100,000 operations a second. Oscar, place the silicone chip in one of these three boxes. I won't look. What are we doing? Just do it, will you? (CLICKS) Okay, you're on. (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) It's not in the first box. (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) Not in the second. It's in the third box. Get it, one of Rudy Well's quick inventions... He put a sensory device in your bionic arm. Right? When my hand passes over a microprocessor circuit... get a flashing blue light in my bionic eye. I know I'm going to be sorry after I say this... but is all this because you want to get to Los Angeles to help Ed Carpenter? Look, Oscar, Ed Carpenter has spent two months on the docks. He's finally located the Pier where the microprocessors are being brought in. He's even found out that they're scheduled to arrive within the next three days. Going through my files again, eh? Well, I had nothing to do yesterday after dinner. The point is, Oscar, when the shipment does arrive... Carpenter has no way of detecting where the chips are hidden... you see, but I do... now. Steve, know that Ed Carpenter is a good friend of yours... but I've got a much more important assignment for you now. Oscar, you don't seem to realize that whoever is smuggling these things in... has the potential of building mini-computers that could literally pick... the brains of our defense system computers. All right. All right, I've been here before. You win. I guess I was dreaming when I thought that Carpenter could wrap this up himself. Thanks, Oscar. I'll get you into the rooming house where Carpenter's located. I needn't tell you how rough they play on those docks, Steve? No, you don't, but I kinda figured you would. But I'll be on the 10:00 flight to the West Coast. Oh, you've already got your ticket, eh? Right. By the way, what cover name is Carpenter using? Brennan. Abe Brennan. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (BRAKES SQUEAL) Hey. Hey. Hi, there, Ernie. Hi, Abe! How's it goin' with school? Fine. Ernie, go inside and wash up. Yes, Mommy. Mr. Brennan? Yes, Mrs. Cook? Are you gonna be out long? I mean, I'm serving supper at 6:00 sharp. Don't worry, I'll be there. I'm just going out to get a paper. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) (TIRES SQUEALING) What's up, Jimbo? Tony wants to see you, Brennan. I can't work tonight. I put in a full shift today. We'll see you get a long rest, Fed! Get in there. (CAR DOOR CLOSES) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Yes? I'm Mack Stoffer, I phoned this morning. Oh, yes, come right in, I'll show you the room. Here it is. It's small but it's clean. Well, this will do just fine. Would you mind paying a week's rent in advance? No, not at all. Uh, Mrs. Cook, I have a friend staying here, I think, Abe Brennan? He is staying here, isn't he? Why yes he is. He has the front room... but he's not in. Well, do you know where he is? Mr. Stoffer, I can't be expected to keep track of all my roomers. Well, I just thought... Look, he's a longshoreman. So was my husband. Now he'd take off without a word for a day or a week or a month... until finally he took off for good. So you see I can't really keep track of anybody. I understand. (DISTANT BOAT HORN SOUNDS) Hey, little man, what happened? A big truck ran over it. Oh, it did, huh? You live here? Uh-huh. Hey, crying isn't gonna help any, let's have a look. If you can't fix it, nobody can. Well, I don't know, I've seen some pretty slick repair work on wrecks worse than this. The frames all twisted, the wheel's are all bent. If that got fixed, it would be a miracle. Sometimes miracles happen. I never saw one. You never know. You gotta have faith. Faith? Sure. You gotta believe that a miracle can happen. MRS. COOK: Ernest, come in to supper. Yes, Momma. (OMINOUS MUSIC) MAN: Hello. (STEPS APPROACHING) (BREATHING HEAW) Tony, I'm upset. I know, sir, Brennan. Clumsy. Clumsy. You don't dump bodies in the ocean unless you want them to be found. The police will be on our necks now. We've got to move fast. The ship docks tomorrow. I want our special cargo in this warehouse by midnight tomorrow. Oh, no sweat, Mr. Logan. Then you'll be leaving right after you get the stuff. As quickly as I can. These are the only chips in the world that suit our purpose. Now remember, I want all 20 cases delivered here promptly. All right, which case has the stuff? Only three cans in one case are what I'm after. It's not necessary for you to know which case. My technicians can ascertain that. You just bring them all here. And Tony... Brennan was a Fed, wasn't he? Yeah, he was. Jimbo traced a call he made to an agency in Washington. They could have more than one man in your crew. I want you to be very careful. Oh, don't worry, Mr. Logan, from now on we're gonna be extra careful. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Hey, uh... Where can I find the boss? You want the foreman. Right. Tony Anderson. That's him right over there with the clipboard. Much obliged. You Anderson? Yeah? Mack Stoffer. Now what is this? I asked the union to send me down a guy who's worked here before. Next in line for the job. I got no time to break in a new man. Now wait. New man? I've worked ten years, off and on. Seattle, huh? TONY: Why'd you quit in Seattle? Uh... Family trouble. Had to move to LA. Well, I guess there's nothing I can do about it. Same union. Same work. Just see that you do the work. Jimbo! Come here! Yeah, Tony. New man, Mack Stoffer. I thought you didn't want new men? TONY: The union sent him down, what could I do? You guys sure know how to make a fella feel wanted. You drive a lift? Try me. That's my rig over there. Take it over to 55 and unload it, just inside the door. You got it! I don't know, Tony. I don't like it. You think I do? It's gettin' so I figure every face I don't knew could belong to a Fed. TONY: But the last thing we need right now is union trouble. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna keep an eye on him. Make sure you do, huh, Jimbo? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Hey, hey! What are you doin'? Oh, just lookin' over the cargo. Busy dock you got here. You afraid of hard work? No. Well, let's see how you can heave. Come on. Toss these boxes up here. Come on, let's go. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS, HUFFS) Is that fast enough? I can handle anything you can throw. (GROANS) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) Okay, okay. Well, you can really handle these mamas, huh? (CHUCKLES) Come on, we got some trucks to unload. Come on, kid. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (FORKLIFT APPROACHING) He looks good. Yeah, don't worry about him, he's a longshoreman, not a Fed. Anyone toss boxes like he can... Yeah, I guess I'm just jumpy, huh? You take care of things here. I gotta go see the man. Sam, come on. Here we go. Well, you guys sure work hard around here. Yeah. You can say that again. You know, I had a pal up in Seattle, I think he's working here now. Abe Brennan. Yeah, Brennan. He's with this crew. It sure would be great to see him again. You don't know where he's workin, do you? I don't know. I haven't seen him today. Maybe he went out and tied one on last night. Yeah... Hey, fella's, huh? Let's get back to work. When you finish loading, find the driver and tell him to get it out of here. Slave driver. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (PHONE DINGS) (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Steve! Well, I got my job, Oscar. So far so good. You're wrong, pal. It's no good at all. I want you out of there. Don't start that again, Oscar. I'm staying. They found Ed Carpenter's body in the ocean a couple of hours ago. OSCAR: I'm sony I had to tell you that because I know how close you two were. I'll check with you later, Oscar. (OMINOUS MUSIC) ERNEST: Come on, bike, get straight. Please, bike, come on. I gotta wish. Well, that's a man-sized bite. You know, I never did get your name. Ernie. Ernie. You always eat out here, Ernie? Mm-mm. Told Mama I had to. Well, how come? I gotta wish. Oh, yeah, the bike... It don't work... STEVE: No? Well, you've got to give wishing a chance. You got to be patient. Been wishin' real hard. It'll pay off, you can count on it. Maybe not until after you're in bed. Ernest, haven't you finished yet? No, mama. Well then you better come on inside and sit at the table. I told you you could come out here only if you ate. Now come on inside. Yes, Mother. Then may I go right to bed? To bed? So early? Yeah, so I can wish in bed. All right, we'll see... you go on inside. Ernest told me what you said to him about wishing for his bike to be fixed. He did? Mr. Stoffer, I can't afford to get that bike fixed. Now I let him sit out here because he was so excited... but I really wish you wouldn't fill his head with wild ideas. Well, I didn't think having faith was such a wild idea. Faith in the possible, maybe. Anyway, please just don't tease him. Would you like your supper now? Well, I'm gonna walk into town, look things over. I'll get something there, but thank you anyway. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (METAL CREAKING) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (METAL CREAKING) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (METAL CREAKING) ERNEST: Wow! Golly! Quick, Mom, quick! Come and look! MRS. COOK: Ernest, what are you hollerin' about? My bike! It's fixed! Who fixed it? It's a miracle, Mom! It's a miracle! MRS. COOK: Well, how do you suppose it got fixed? Faith! I must have faith. That's how. And the spirit did it. Are you sure this is the same bike? It looks the same, doesn't it? It's fixed. Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Stoffer. I just want to ask. Did you bring Ernest a new bicycle? No, ma'am. I didn't. Well someone did. Well, that's nice. Ernest thinks it's a miracle, that spirits did it. Well, that's even nicer. Oh, here's your lunch. Now I know you're gonna say that it's not yours... but it is. The spirits gave it to me. Have a good day. Yeah, you too. (TIRES SCREECHING) Hey, mister, look! Well, what do you know! Would you look at that. The spirits did a miracle and fixed my bike. You're crazy, Ernest! There ain't no such thing as spirits. Oh, I think there are lots of them. Some people believe in them, some people don't. I believe in 'em! I got faith in 'em, too. Just a bunch of jive. Atta boy. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) Stoffer. Take over for Bill over there on that lift and put it in 55. Right. Al! I told you! He went out last night for a paper! That's all I know! How long did Mr. Brennan live here? About two months. Did he have any visitors or friends you know about? Mister, I don't pry. On the waterfront, you don't pry. We'd like you to cooperate, Mrs. Cook. Look, I'm sorry he's dead. I really am. He was a very nice man. But there's nothing more I can say. If you did know something about this... would you be afraid to tell me? What do you think? I think you should know you'd be well protected. Oh, sure... Don't snow me, mister, I've lived down here too long. I've known other people who talk about what they've seen down here. And all they've gotten for their troubles are a few broken bones... and worse. This case is different. The man you knew as Brennan was an undercover man for the government. We believe that's why he was killed. Now Mrs. Cook, If you'll cooperate with us... government agents will protect you and your family. Well, Mrs. Cook? I've told you everything. If you should change your mind... Sure. Sure, I'll get in touch. I'll let myself out. STEVE: Mrs. Cook, I have a friend staying here, I think. Abe Brennan? Hey, Ernie. Yeah. Where'd you get that, Charlie? Junkyard. For what? I want it fixed, Ernest. I can't fix it. I want the guy who fixed your bike to fix my bike. It wasn't no guy, it was a spirit, Charlie. Okay, then get your spirit to fix it. Can't. Why not? Not my bike. If it was mine, the spirit would fix it right away. Tell the spirit it's yours, what's the difference? That would be a lie. You mustn't lie to a spirit. Now listen, Ernest, I don't care how you do it... but you see you get that bike fixed, here by tomorrow... or you're in big trouble. Excuse me. Mister? I'm looking for Mack Stoffer. Well, he was driving a forklift over there. Thanks. Mr. Stoffer, I brought your lunch! Two lunches, Mrs. Cook? I have to talk to you! Follow me. So I told the detective that I didn't know anything... but I do, Mr. Stoffer. Mrs. Cook, I don't think you should have come down here. MRS. COOK: If you're a friend of Mr. Brennan's, then you might be in danger, too. I had to warn you. STEVE: Warn me about what? MRS. COOK: The men who picked up Mr. Brennan last night work on this deck. I've seen them often. Yeah, but you didn't tell the police that? No. I wanted to stay out of it. I couldn't see how it could help Mr. Brennan now. But if anything happened to you and I hadn't warned you... Mrs. Cook, what makes you think anything can happen to me? They told me Mr. Brennan was a government agent. You said he was your friend. I just got to thinking maybe you... Are an agent, too? MRS. COOK: Yeah. Mrs. Cook, you're a very brave woman for coming down here... and I appreciate your concern. I think you should go straight home and not mention a word of this to anyone. Do you understand? Thank you again for coming. Fred. Hey! Did you unload 20 boxes of coconut oil? How should I know? Look, buddy, this is important. It was supposed to be down in the hold, the Stevedore says they're not there. He thinks they might have get mixed up with that Hawaii Fruit consignment. Tony, I just lift them, I don't get acquainted with them. Get off the rig, go down to 70 and look for it. Hey, Tony! Tony. Come on. We got trouble. I know we got trouble. That special shipment is missing, it's not in the cargo. The coconut oil? I unloaded it myself. I stashed it. Well, at least we figured that out. You're not gonna feel so good when you hear what I just found out. What? Brennan's landlady saw us take him. Are you sure about that? Yeah, I just heard her tell that new guy, Stoffer. What's he got to do with it? Because she came to warn him. Because she thinks he's a Fed, too. And from his reaction, he is. Well... we'll just have to handle them both. Go get Sam. We'll have him take care of the woman. The way we took care of Brennan? No, we can't risk that until after we deliver the stuff to Logan... and he has a chance to split. Have Sam bring the woman to Logan's place. All right. But what about Stoffer? We're gonna handle him right here. It's gotta look like an accident, Jimbo. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Hey, Mack! Hey! I've got a special job on 53. I'm taking a trip with you. Okay, we got a special shipment to look for. Come on. Special shipment? Yeah, coconut oil. About 20 boxes. Yeah, what sized boxes? Oh, about so big. Come on. You... You look around here. All right. I'll take the other side. (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (GRUNTS) (MOANS) (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (CAR APPROACHING) ERNIE: Momma! (TIRES SQUEALING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (MILITARY MUSIC) (PHONE BUZZES) Yes, Steve? I've got the chips, Oscar. All of them. Good. I'll send my men in to pick up those involved. Yeah. I've got a hunch they'll talk about whoever hired them to smuggle this stuff in. The foreman's name is Tony Anderson. STEVE: There's a guy named Jimbo involved. I don't know who else but... Hang on a minute, Oscar. Hey. What's the matter, partner? A big, mean, ugly man came and took her away. Took who away? My momma. Your momma. Tell you what, don't you worry, Ernest, we'll find your momma. Wait just a second, okay? Oscar, hold off sending your men onto the docks. Listen. Have you got the chips or haven't you? Well, I do and I don't. I may have to use them to bargain with. What? Listen, are you crazy? No, Oscar. Just worried. Come on, little man. Ernie, is there anybody else in the house? No. Tell you what. I'm gonna have to leave you here for a little while, okay? And find my momma? To find your momma. You promise? Oh, I promise. Remember, you gotta have faith, now. I sure hate leaving you here alone, but... Hey, Charlie. Yeah. Come here a minute. Say won't you do me a favor. What kind of favor? Take Ernie over to your house this afternoon and keep him there awhile, huh? What for? You see, his mom's not here and I don't want to leave him alone. No deal. What? I told him to get those spirits to fix my bike. He didn't do it. I'll tell you what. You take Ernie to your house this afternoon... and I'll make sure the spirits get that bike fixed. You will? STEVE: I guarantee it. It's a deal. Come on, Ernest. See you, Ernie. (dramatic music) (BIONIC EYE SOUND EFFECT) Beautiful, beautiful. What's the matter? He hurt you, tiger? Oh, Tony, I don't know what slugged me, but something did. Yeah, well, Stoffer's missing. And one of these boxes of coconut oil is missing, too. Which one? How do I know which one? There was supposed to be 20, now there's only 19. Come on. Hello, Mr. Logan. Tony. Mr. Logan, sir, we've got some trouble. One of the boxes from the special shipment is missing. Yes, sir, I know. I can't be sure if it's the one, but I... I'll get right back to you, sir. Oh, you got a nerve. You've got some nerve. Hey, Tony, let me handle it, huh? I owe him one. Cool it. Looking for this? A box, not a can. Well, the rest of the box is hidden, you see. I just brought this along to prove that I had the real thing. Tony? Huh? Come on. Cool it, Jimbo. What kind of a game are you trying to play, Mack? Well, it's called swap. I give you what you want, in exchange for the kidnapped woman, Mrs. Cook. I can't make that kind of deal with you. STEVE: Well, you better take me to the man who can. And I'm not bluffing, Tony. Unless you free Mrs. Cook... you don't stand a chance of getting those other eleven cans. And I know how valuable they are. All right. Let's go to my car. Come on. Jimbo, you come along. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) He what? He got away with one of the boxes, Mr. Logan. He's got it hidden. How could he know which box it was? Here's a sample. Robert. That's it. I want the rest of those cans. And I want the woman you had kidnapped. I could have you both killed. Then you never would find the rest of those cans, now would you? I ain't got an idea where he's got it hid, Mr. Logan. Have Sam bring the woman in. How did you know which box contained the chips? Oh, I'm psychic. What does it matter? I've got them. You want them. Indeed I do. But I find it hard to believe that a government man... would turn over such a valuable item, just to save a woman he hardly knows. (DOOR CLOSES) Mr. Stoffer. They got you, too? You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Now, then, Mr. Stoffer, we make the trade. You tell us where the other cans are and you can both walk out of here. (LAUGHS) You've got a real sense of humor, Mr. Logan. You wouldn't let us go until you check to make sure I was telling the truth. And if you had the other cans, you wouldn't let us go at all. Then just how do you suggest we handle this? She leaves now. Give her five minutes to catch a cab. Then I'll deliver. All right. I trust you've learned from this experience, young lady. It would be very unwise for you to do any talking in the future. Are you gonna be all right? I'll be fine. Head on home. Five minutes, you said? I don't need the five minutes, Logan. What do you mean? (DOOR CLOSING) She's out now. That's all I needed. (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (BIONIC SOUND EFFECT) (CLANGS) No, no, please. I won't give you any trouble. Only how... how could you do all this? I don't have time to give you another demonstration. I got a bicycle to fix. You what? Never mind. You wouldn't understand. This is quite a surprise. I didn't expect you. It's a good thing you didn't tell me what you had planned. I must admit, though, it worked out well, Steve. Well, why'd you come? I made up my mind when you hung up on me. MRS. COOK: Steve? Uh... Excuse me, Oscar. I've got one little bit of unfinished business to attend to. (METAL CLANGING) Hi, Ernie. Hi. Say, where did you get all this stuff? My friends. "My friends"? You know, Ernie... suppose I told you that... Well, I fixed your bicycle? And Charlie's, too. You couldn't. It was magic. Well, in a way you're right. It was the magic of science. You know, the kind of magic that sends men to the moon and things like that. And by the time you're a man... science will do many more magical things... more than you and I could ever dream of. Truth? STEVE: That's the truth. Then I have to give it back! Give what back? All that money just to fix this junk! And how much was that? A whole dollar and I spent it. (PLAYFUL MUSIC) Blame it on me, huh? I'll see you, little man. Okay, Steve. What was all that about? Magic. You win some and you lose some. Magic? It's a long story, Oscar. Let's go.
