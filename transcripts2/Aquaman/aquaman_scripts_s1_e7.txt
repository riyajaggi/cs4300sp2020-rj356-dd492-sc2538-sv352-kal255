 Let me go! [intense music] (Aqualad) 'Take your slimy arms off, you..' You! Release them. [zapping] [grunting] You can't escape from those suction cups, Aqualad. You know who I am? You, Aqualad, are the perfect decoy to lure Aquaman into my trap. 'I must learn from him his secret' 'of communicating with sea creatures.' Which with my own powerful new weapon will make me King of the seas. Guards, to your posts. [dramatic music] Aquaman. Aquaman, emergency. (Aqualad on speaker) 'But be careful of a trap.' Got it, tadpole. On my way. [intense music] No time to lose, follow me. Look, the Sea King approaches. Down. [bubbling] (male narrator)  About to be overpowered  by the Octoguards the Sea King issues  a telepathic command for help. [music continues] Aquaman, get us off here. [barking] This suction is too.. 'I could use some horsepower.' Pull, Imp. Pull, Storm. That does it. [barking] Guards, take them! [dramatic music] [neighing] Now, Aquaman. Reveal to me your secret of communicating with sea creatures. It's simple, Your Majesty all you do is concentrate hard. Like this. (male narrator)  Taking advantage  of the opportunity Aquaman again issues  a telepathic summons for reinforcements. - I see no results. - Look, here comes a stingray. [crackling] (Aquaman) 'Or if you prefer lobsters.' Or electric stargazers. All guards, attack! At once! Here come the king's troops. And here come our troops. bam [crackling] Let's pitch in, team. [barking] [crackling] Storm, Imp, he's all yours! - Guess they've had enough. - Check. Please, Aquaman. I have a shocking surprise for you. 'Powerhouse, release the force monster.' (male narrator)  Now, inside the powerhouse Octomen activate  a fantastic power generator. - Okay, let's get out of-- - Aquaman, look. (Aqualad) 'It's an electric octo-giant.' Reveal your secret of telepathy or my electric force monster will destroy you all. If he can catch us. Let's go, team! [crackling] thud - Bouncing butterfish! - Stay out of its way. Yipe! His touch is deadly. Need help to turn off his power. Storm, Imp, you and the fish keep him busy. 'Let's go, Aqualad.' [dramatic music] [Tusky yelping] [beeping] Aqualad, turn the power up. Full. [Tusky yelping] (Aqualad) 'Full power, Aquaman.' No, it will explode! It will destroy the entire city. Come on, Aqualad. We'd better clear out too. Go, everybody. On the move, fast. [crackling] Get out, it's going to blow up. [explosion] Well, I guess that's the end of the Octo City. Yes, tadpole. Too bad. Come on, let's go. [barking] Steady, whiskers. Steady. That's just a friendly octopus minding his own business. Come on. [barking] (male narrator) In just a moment, we'll return  with another exciting adventure featuring a guest star from  the galaxy of super superhero. [theme music] Here come the Teen Titans. A quartet of powering talents. Kid Flash, whose speed  defies the eye to follow. Wonder Girl, swift  and powerful super lass. Speedy, whose fantastic arrows  perform awesome feats. Aqualad, bold and daring  marine marvel. Fabulous foursome  for right against might the "Teen Titans." [instrumental music] It is a quiet morning when an awesome creature  rears up out of the sea and strides up  onto the deserted beach. bam [beeping] crash In moments, news  of the weird raider reaches the secret mountain  headquarters of the mighty Teen Titans. Speedy to Titans. Come in, Teen Titans. Aqualad here. Wonder Girl here. Kid Flash here. - What's up, Speedy-O - Condition Red. Rendezvous Sector C for Charlie B for beta, D for double. - Be there in a flash. - Roger. Wilco. (male narrator)  A short while later from land, sea and air three teenage fighters  join forces. [beeping] Come on, team, we gotta stop this thing. clang clang Slow down, you overgrown wind-up toy. Whoa, boy, whoa! What do we have to do to stop this thing? Maybe an armor-piercing arrow can do the trick. bam [both screaming] What do we do? Let it go? No, we've gotta find out where it comes from. Okay, it's in my element now. Let me handle it. Check. We'll follow in the copter. splash [dramatic music] bam (Wonder Girl) 'Oh, there's that crazy machine.' Yeah, but where's Aqualad? Thanks, Leggy. Gotta go follow that mechanical monster. [dramatic music] [machine whirring] Leaping land fish! He got me again. [engine revving] Merciful Venus! Look! (Kid Flash) 'Hey, Aqualad's in trouble.' Come on, put this eggbeater down. Fast. Let go of me, you big lug! Let go! You think this boomerang arrow will work, Speedy? Just hang on to your lariat. This is where I go to work. bam crash (Aqualad) Nice work, team. Now, let's go see who controls this thing. [beeping] (Speedy) Holy haddocks! This thing is a giant spaceship! But where did it come from? And dig that crazy computer. [beeping] Stop, stay...where you are. Suffering Sappho. It-it talks. Spooky. Let's have a good look at it. Repeat, stay...where you are. Shouldn't we stop? Forget it. Now you shall be destroyed. [intense music] Look! It means business. Scatter, Titans. [dramatic music] Come and get me, fellas. [explosion] Whoopsy-daisy. (Aqualad) 'Great guppies!' When the two robots exploded the computer started speeding up like crazy. Must be the answer. Yeow! [crackling] Turn it towards me, gill head. (Aqualad) 'Be my guest, evil eye.' clang Great shot, Speedy boy. crash (Speedy) 'The computer is going out of it's electronic mind.' pew pew Watch out, this last robot's on a rampage. pew pew Nice going, Wonder Girl. Am I glad these Amazon bracelets are invulnerable. Deflect the bolts back at them. pew pew You read my mind, Kid Flash. [explosion] [beeping] Hey, look at that crazy machine now. It's going to explode. Everybody out, fast. [beeping] (Kid Flash) Take off, Speedy. [engine revving] [explosion] Wow. What a blast! (Kid Flash) 'Whoever sent that invasion force from space' 'will think twice before trying it again.' Well, time for me to head home. Same here. (Wonder Girl) Bye, gang. Hey, what about me? [chuckles] You're just stuck in this old copter, twinkle toes until we reach solid ground. [instrumental music] (male narrator)  Coming up next,  more action packed adventures with Aquaman,  King of the Seven Seas. Featuring Aqualad  and Tusky the walrus. [neighing] [instrumental music] [Tusky barking] What in the Seven Seas is Tusky up to, Aquaman? Must be something up ahead he wants us to see, Aqualad. (male narrator)  Hiding on a rusty  barnacle-encrusted wreck a sinister metal-clad figure attracted by Tusky's  excited barking peers out at the approaching  Sea King and his friends. [sniggering] Aquaman, you've bested me before but now it is my turn. Now, the Torpedo's will have revenge. Jumping jackfish, Tusky. Did you bring us out here just to see that old wreck? Wait, Aqualad. I just saw something move in there. You're right, Aquaman. I.. 'Sufferin' sunfish!' 'It's the Torpedoman.' (Aquaman) 'So, that's where he's been hiding out.' [theme music] Here he comes. Split, tadpole, fast. [Torpedoman laughing] (Aquaman) No, you don't, Torpedo. You can't escape me this time, Aquaman. Watch him, Aquaman. (Aquaman) 'Gotcha!' [Torpedoman laughing] This won't hold me long. He's right. Aquaman. I know, tadpole. I'm summoning help. (male narrator)  Aquaman's telepathic command  quickly reaches a school of  blockbusting barracudas and powerful paddlefish,  who race to the sea king's aid. [Torpedoman laughing] He's cut himself loose. (Aquaman) 'Yes, but here come the troops.' Now, let's grab him, tadpole. Missed him. He's slippery as a greased eel. (Aqualad) 'Now, what's he up to?' 'Holy swordfish. He's coming down like a big anchor.' Scatter. (Aqualad) 'Tusky!' clang Let me give you a hand, Torpedo. (Aqualad) 'Nice toss, Aquaman. That oughta hold him.' (Aquaman) Not for long, Minnow. Look! Here he comes. (Aquaman) Take cover. Now, where is he? Look out, duck! [dramatic music] It's like there's ten of him. How long can he keep this up? Until we catch him. [Torpedoman laughing] [whimpering] Wavin' wolfish. Harpoons! [beeping] [laughing] (Aqualad) 'Swell, Aquaman!' Where's Torpedo? He's vanished again. (Aquaman) 'Stay alert, Aqualad. He's up to something, I'll bet.' Now, they're just where I want 'em. [beeping] Trembling triggerfish. An electric grid. Must be how Torpedo recharges his batteries. This is the end for you, Aquaman! Aquaman, look out! [crackling] [Torpedoman screaming] Mumbling Morays. He's a goner. No. He maybe our enemy, but I can't let him die. [beeping] (Aqualad) 'What are they doing, Aquaman?' (Aquaman) 'Drawing the electricity from Torpedoman.' (Aqualad) 'Boy, I hope he appreciates' 'that you saved his life, Aquaman.' Forget it. Let's wrap him up and take him into Atlantis. [laughing] You'll never take me in. Ha-ha-ha. (Aqualad) 'He's getting away.' (Aquaman) 'Watch out.' crash Leapin' weakfish. Now, we're really snagged. [grunting] Can't lift or break this metal mesh. Go on, Storm, Imp. Pull, Tusky. [grunting] It's too heavy. (Torpedoman) 'Now, to send those marine marvels' to their doom. crash [intense music] Jumping jellyfish. The ship's rocking. It's gonna slide off this ledge. What are we gonna do, Aquaman? For this job, we need big muscle. And fast. (male narrator)  This time the sea king  issues an urgent summons for help to a giant octopus. (Aqualad) 'We're sunk, Aquaman. We're sunk.' (Aquaman) 'Not yet, Aqualad.' Here comes help. Alright, fella. Take hold. Now, lift. (Aqualad) 'Lift, fella. Pull!' (Torpedoman) One more smash and it's all over. Oh! I can't get out! I, ah-ha-ha, can't! Ah! Now or never. - We're out! - Away, quickly. [intense music] boom Destroyed by his own treachery. Don't bet on it, Aqualad. With his fantastic powers, I've a hunch he'll be menacing us and the Seven Seas again 'all too soon.' Come on, let's get out of here. [dramatic music] [theme music] [music continues]
