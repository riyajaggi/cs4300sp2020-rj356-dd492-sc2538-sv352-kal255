 - Who, who are they? - Beats me, Aqualad. Listen, the storm seems to be letting up. [thunder rumbling] Look, they, they're alive! Must have been in suspended animation. Come on, Aqualad, let's greet them. (male #1) 'Stop!' [neighing] Who are you, puny ones? Easy, buster. You're talking to Aquaman, King of the Seven Seas. Ha! Ridiculous. I, Nepto, am the true ruler of the seas. Nepto? There was a tyrant by that name who threatened Atlantis long ago before an undersea earthquake buried him. Aye, now Nepto has returned. And this time I shall conquer Atlantis again. 'Warriors, take them!' - Say when, Aquaman. - Now, take off. [dramatic music] thud swish thud Clumsy oafs! I, Nepto, will destroy them myself. [crackling] Now you shall be locked away forever! thud [crackling] thud (Nepto) 'The way is clear. On to Atlantis!' You alright, tadpole? Yeah, but we've gotta get out of here before those characters get to Atlantis. Ah, no use. These rocks are wedged tighter than a giant clam. - Listen. - What's that? [Tusky yelping] It's Tusky. He's tracked us here somehow. [Tusky yelping] Meanwhile,  Nepto and his warriors have reached  the Great Dome of Atlantis which shimmers  in the depths of the sea. Hear this, Atlantis! I, Nepto, ruler of all the oceans have returned. 'Surrender or be destroyed!' Nepto! Can it be possible? What shall we do? Where's Aquaman? Why does Aquaman not help us? (Aqualad) Come on, Tusky, don't quit. No use. It's too much for him. I'd better summon help. zap [Tusky yelping] [clapping] Now to get to Atlantis fast! [clapping] - Go, Storm! - Go, Imp! Go! Along the way,  the Sea King summons a great army of fish allies. Hear this, Atlantis my last warning. Surrender or feel the power of Nepto! [crackling] [explosion] Look, here comes Aquaman with help! You? Again? 'Now I shall destroy you!' Electric eels, charge! zap [crackling] clang [explosion] Infernal Aquaman! Charge, warriors! Cut them down! This way, Aqualad. 'Let's get 'em, troops.' creak (Nepto) 'Hear me, Aquaman.' 'Call off your armada and leave' or I will shatter the dome with my trident's full power. Great waves. If he cracks the dome the sea will crash in. And destroy Atlantis. I warn you, Aquaman. Act quickly! Okay, Nepto, you win. All fish, retreat! Follow me and be ready. Now Atlantis is truly mine at last. [laughing] Now, Aqualad! Now, Nepto, we'll put you and your warriors 'in an Atlantean prison.' You shall pay for this someday. Heed him not, Aquaman for I, Aqualad am the true King of the Seven Seas. (Aquaman) 'And so I crown you, O King.' Hey! Let me out of here! Help! [laughing] [clapping] In just a moment,  we will return with another  exciting adventure featuring a guest star from the galaxy  of super superheroes. (male narrator)  The Justice League of America. The combined fighting power  of the Man of Steel and the Cosmic Crusader the Winged Avenger and the King of the Sea the Tiny Titan and the Scarlet Streak. All working together  for good against evil as the Justice League  of America. boom Towards planet Earth streaks a strange  remote-controlled missile plunging through  the stratosphere. It plants itself  in the rock-strewn terrain of the isolated  mountainous wasteland. Now in the flagship  of a large armed space armada poised for invasion.

He must not warn Earth of our plan! [intense music] boom Calling Justice League. Need help, urgent. Responding to the SOS two Justice League champions  rocket to the rescue. Block off their rays, Green Lantern while I take care of them. Check, Superman. zap He's safe now. I'll take him down. [dramatic music] boom - Nice work, Superman. - No sweat, Green Lantern. - Velcar has escaped. - There is no time to lose! Quickly, order standby for attack! Activate magno-unit missile! Magno-unit missile activated. Now from the missile's antenna powerful electric waves  pan out toward the sun driving Earth  in a powerful magnetic pull and drawing her out of orbit. There is no time to lose. Romnex, a criminal warlord banished from my world 'has planted a magnetic device' 'to draw Earth closer to the sun.' 'Then he will attack in force.' - It's already begun. - Yes, it's getting hot. Got to work fast. [laughs] Within minutes, Earth will be powerless to resist the invasion. 'See? Already her polar icecaps starts to melt.' 'Her jungles begin to wither and die.' Not even the powerful men of the Justice League can save Earth now. Flash, you and the Atom track down and break up that magno missile. Check. Hang on, squirt. Hawkman, Velcar is yours. Take him to a safe place. There's no safer place than my orbiting spaceship. Let's go. You hold off the invaders, Green Lantern. - I'll push the Earth back. - Okay, I'm off. Up, up and away! [dramatic music] (Superman) 'Don't fight me, Mother Earth.' [grunting] Incredible!

The speedy one, he draws closer to the magno missile. swish Thar she blows, Flasheroo! Am I glad. This is our sixth trip around the globe. swish Activate magno's armament. Hurry! [sizzling] [explosion] - Take over, peanut. - Right. Got to make myself smaller. [sizzling] [glass shattering] boom How did I do, Flasheroo? A-Okay, mighty might. 'Let's get back to the headquarters.' Find out how the others are doing. They did it. Now, to see if Green Lantern needs a hand. Away! Superman approaching. [explosion] zap crash Order retreat. Too late. We're hit. Plummeting earthward,  the command craft is picked up on monitors in Hawkman's  orbiting spaceship. Attention, Flash and Atom, invader ship approaching. They're up on that plateau. Hold tight, Atom. Blast them! [sizzling] thud pow zap Looks as if they've had it, Green Lantern. So have I. Let's go down. Romnex wanted to occupy Earth. Well, he got his wish. Only he'll be occupying it in a prison cell. I'll return you to your world, Velcar where you'll be a real hero. Perhaps. But I shall tell them that the true heroes are the Justice League of America. Coming up next,  more action-packed adventures with Aquaman,  King of the Seven Seas. Featuring Aqualad  and Tusky the Walrus. [neighing] (male narrator)  From out of a brilliant  fiery sun a huge alien ship comes  streaking toward Earth at incredible speed. [whirring] [intense music] Unaware of the danger  from above Aqualad,  astride his seahorse Imp is racing Tusky,  his pet walrus. When suddenly.. [dramatic music] Looks like somebody's trying to light up the ocean. Let's have a look. Suffering sailfish! [whirring] [dramatic music] They are lighting up the ocean with fire. Fire plant number one operational, sir. Excellent. Soon we convert the oceans of Earth to deserts. Meanwhile in the Aquacave.. [device beeping] The heat sensor is pulsating at coordinates Alpha 17 and Victor 6. Well, that's not an ordinary fire. It's too-- (Aqualad on radio) 'Aquaman? Aquaman?' 'The ocean's on fire. Hurry!' Check, Aqualad. I am on my way. [dramatic music] [neighing] This calls for more speed than you can furnish Storm, old friend. [neighing] [sizzling] [swishing] Steady, Imp. Hold on, boy! [neighing] Ah! [Tusky yelping] [intense music] Aquaman! Let's put out that fire. Relax, tadpole. I'm calling for help from our friends. zap Narwhals? What can they do to help? Dig tunnels for water to rush in under the fire. (Aqualad) Wow! What a great idea! - 'What's with the whales?' - Hop aboard and see. Okay, fellas. Make like fire boats. swoosh [rumbling] [gushing] We did it, Aquaman! We did it! The ocean people have extinguished the fire. Release two more fire crafts to attack at once! [swishing] Look, Aquaman, they're not giving up. Neither are we, minnow. But we can't handle two of them at one time. I am ordering a school of jellyfish to blanket the left rear quadrant. 'That's where one of those ships is headed.' (Aqualad) 'I get it.' 'The jellyfish will absorb their fire chemical.' (Aquaman) 'Before it ignites the water, I hope.' [gushing] Holy haddock! It's working. Uh-huh. But now we're under attack. [whirring] Dive! [sizzling] (Aquaman) Churn up the water. [sizzling] splash [bubbling] [dramatic music] Fire plant numbers two and three destroyed! Descend immediately! We will destroy their capital Atlantis. [whirring] splash That spaceship's making like a submarine. [whirring] And it's firing at Atlantis. If that missile hits, Atlantis is doomed. thud boom You okay, Aquaman? Yes. Come on. We're not finished yet. It's an all out attack. We'll need help. Responding to their monarch's  telepathic order a school of dolphins  fall into battle formation and streak to the attack. boom [intense music] thud boom They are frustrating all our efforts, Excellency. Blast them with fire balls! swish swish [whooshing] Help me create a suction to draw them off. Come on! [swishing] - Now what? - Wait and see. - Whales? - Yep. My sea elephants. (Aquaman) 'Get set for a big push, boys.' Now! [gushing] Jam control! (Aquaman) Up, boys. Up! [gushing] Can't say I'm sorry to see them go. Nor am I, tadpole. I only hope they don't come back for another try. Amen to that, amen. [yelping] [theme music]
