 Whoppin' flatfish! That's terrific. Even better than our early warning system. Check, minnow. Now let's.. (Aquaman) 'What's wrong, Tusky?' [whimpering] (Aqualad) 'Why, that's..' '...that's Captain Barracuda and Starro.' They're attacking the Jewel People. Come on. Let's ride, team. [dramatic music] [beeping] [theme music] [swooshing] Starro, ink them! [laughs] [screaming] After them, Starro. Quickly! Winged wolfish! Captain Cuda's clobbering the Jewel People. It's time we clobber him. Attack! Now, let's lower the boom on that character. I'll stop those two marine marvels myself. Jumpin' jackfish! Look out, Tadpole! [gunshot] [grunts] Great whales! That pinwheel gizmo paralyzed him. [laughs] That will hold those two till I round up the Jewel People. Hold it, Imp. That won't work. But I'll summon something that will. (male narrator)  From the sea kings brain,  telepathic commands go out. In a moment, two stargazers,  strange stubby fish respond to the  sea king's command. [static] You alright, Tadpole? - I'm all a tingle. - Good. I knew the stargazers could do it. Okay. Now, let's get off to that miserable Captain Cuda. Swell. Except we have no idea where in the seven seas he's gone. What's that? (Aqualad) 'Tusky's brought the Visi-Gem from the Aquacave.' Good boy, Tusky. (Aqualad) 'Now we can find the Jewel People.' 'The Jewel People are taking refuge in their city.' (Aquaman) 'And Captain Cuda's right behind.' 'Come on, team.' Jewels, a whole city of them. And now this will all be mine. 'Rubies, sapphires, diamonds' 'and pearls as big as stars.' [laughs] Starro, attack! (male narrator)  Now, as the giant starfish  contracted suction disks the great dome  is about to crack like a king-sized oyster. (Aquaman) 'Forward, troops, on the double.' Oh, no! Aquaman again. With the fish army. Repel them, Starro. Hit them, blast them! [static] They are getting closer. Ink them, Starro, quickly. [swooshing] Sufferin' sea snakes! How can we fight 'em if we can't see 'em? I'll fix that, minnow. [dramatic music] [slurping] Wow! Look at those pufferfish blot out that ink. Now, to get Starro off that dome. Pull, Starro, pull! pew pew pew [music continues] thud thud I'm not finished yet. Watch it, Aqualad! [laughing] I'll get you Aquaman. Sooner or later my paralyzer will get you. (Aqualad) He's right, Aquaman. It's a standoff. This will take care of you, Walrus. [gunshots] (Aqualad) 'He got Tusky.' [laughs] He's off guard. I'll get him now. [whooshing] [gun clattering] [theme music] Now, Cuda. Let's see how you fight without a weapon. [grunting] [groaning] Nice going, Aquaman. Let's see about poor Tusky. Hold it, Aquaman. I've got a better idea. [barking] [laughs] Great, minnow. Just great. Look, the Jewel People. They're giving you that pearl to show their gratitude. Why, thank you. Thank you very much. Hey, what about Captain Cuda? He's all taken care of, Aqualad. 'He wanted jewel, now he can dig all he wants' 'for the Jewel People.' [theme music] (male narrator)  In just a moment,  we will return with another exciting adventure  featuring a guest star from the galaxy  of super, superheroes.

Winged wonder, who with Screel,  his faithful fighting mascot and his arsenal of phenomenal  powers against both earthly  and interplanetary foes. Hawkman, the Winged Avenger. [theme music] Across the solar system  sneaks a weird beam striking planet Earth. It inches along, relentlessly  forming a path of destruction. [beeping] News of the fearsome phenomenon  soon reaches the vast lab complex,  outside Midway City where Hawkman  hides his identity under the guise  of scientist, Carter Hall. Where is that destructive beam coming from, Carter? From the planet Pluto, Professor Barnes. According to my tracking instruments. Got to hurry before it turns the whole world to rubble. But, but what can you do? I've got to try blocking it off as Hawkman. [dramatic music] (male narrator) Now, Hawkman's piercing signal  bring his pet bird Screel rocketing out of the clouds. [squawking] Cool it, Screel. This is no time for fun and games. Hop aboard. Now, to the spaceship. vroom Must put us between Earth and that beam, quickly. vroom Keep your claws crossed, Screel. [intense music] Hope this craft can withstand this powerful force. vroom We're heating up fast. [squawking] [music continues] Reaching melting point. Not sure we can make it. The beam, it shut off. [squawking] You can say that again, Screel. Wonder what turned it off so suddenly. (male narrator) At this moment, in his fortress  laboratory on Pluto the interplanetary radar,  Kobarah angrily scans the heavens. (Kobarah) That is what bounced our beam back to us. 'A strange spaceship.' (male #1) 'It is lapping now into fixed orbit.' Come on, Screel. Let's pay these Plutonian beam makers a visit. Aliens, a winged man and a bird. Intercept and destroy them while I repair the beam transmitter. Go! [dramatic music] [swooshing] Uh-oh! Here comes the welcoming committee. [gunfire] These boys don't fool around. Thanks, Screel. I'll lock 'em out of action with my repeller rays. [zapping] There, now the beam will continue to desolate Earth in preparation for invasion. [zapping] Great Icarus, the beam! 'It's blasting Earth again.' Come on, Screel. We've got to wreck that deadly gadget fast. This stranger survived the battle.. ...and they're coming here. Deploy! Fire the moment they enter. [gunshots] Go get 'em, Screel. [dramatic music] [squawking] Stand your ground! Keep firing. [gunshots] Have a taste of your own medicine, gents. [zapping] Raven cowards, come back! I, Kobarah, command you to come back. Grab that Kobarah, Screel, while I turn off the beam. [squawking] thuds (Kobarah) 'No, no! Don't touch those controls.' (Hawkman) 'Only with my destructo claw.' screech [zapping stops] Curse you, manbird. You'll pay for this. (Hawkman) 'Now, to make sure no one ever gets' to play with this toy again. I'll destroy the turbines that power it. Great wings of Mercury. [laughs] You broke the electrical circuit 'that protects the turbines.' 'Now, what will you do?' (Hawkman) My chemo claw will knock out it's source. [zapping] Oh! Stop! Any more tricks up your sleeve, Kobarah? Yes. This. bam bam bam [explosion] Thanks for the assist, pal. [rumbling] What's that?

[zapping] thud (Hawkman) Hang on, Kobarah. [squawking] [explosion] (Hawkman) 'Well, Kobarah, that takes care of your scheme' 'to soften up Earth for an invasion.' But you're going to Earth anyhow. Right now! To face justice. [squawking] (male narrator)  Coming up next.. ...more action-packed  adventures with Aquaman King of the Seven Seas. Featuring Aqualad  and Tusky the Walrus.

And turns swiftly to attack. boom boom boom boom boom boom [swooshing] thud boom boom boom [theme music] thud Now, for some strange reason Aquaman voluntarily  enters the submarine commanded by the scientific genius known as the Brain. Ha! Ha! You performed brilliantly. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were Aquaman himself. 'You are his identical image.' This is the Brain calling planet Imago. Brain calling planet Imago. This is Reflecto on Imago. Go ahead, Brain. (Brain) 'The Mirror-Man double you sent me is perfect.' Once I substitute him for the real Aquaman.. ...all the riches of the Earth seas will be ours.

What's eating Aquaman? (Brain) 'I know that one hour out of water and you'll die, Aquaman.' But I won't wait that long. I'll dry you up with direct heat beams. 'And watch you shrivel. Ha ha ha.' Phew! The heat's on alright. I'll turn it to my advantage. [zapping] I said get out and leave me alone. But, Aquaman, I only.. When I say out, I mean out! Yes, sir. Mirror-Man to Brain. I'm inside the Aquacave. From here I can open every access door to Atlantis for your invasion. Exactly as planned. Now, I shall order my-- (alien #1) 'Brain! Brain!' Aquaman, he's escaped. Fools, fools. He's got to come here. I'll take care of him, Brain. I can't understand it, Tusky. - Why should Aquaman-- - Why should I what, minnow? Aquaman! How...how did you get out here? I just left you in the Aquacave. That's not me in there, sardine. You've been seeing double. 'My double. Mirror-Man.' Jumpin' jellyfish! That explains everything. 'Let's get him.' Check!

(Aquaman) 'Gotta stop the Brain from getting away. Come on.' [whooshing] Full power! We'll crash right through that water wall. We'll never make it. Do as I say. Full power! [explosion] The Brain was an evil man. We were deceived into thinking you were the evil one. How about that? That is that. Let's go home, team. [theme music] [music continues]
