Pytho-Rex tells of a winged Earthman who defeated our robot saucers. (astronaut #1) He is called Hawkman. (astronaut #2) His gauntlets possess awesome powers. Pytho-Rex commands that we bait a trap for him. 'Clear the cavern.' Nothing like the handy-dandy electro claw for carving through metal doors. There! Come on, Screel.

Hurry, you guys. Blast off, we'll cover you. vroom That's it, Screel, jam their radar sights while I clog their exhaust with my chemo claw. boom boom I don't know the secret of this gem but for sure that old coot won't be able to use it 'to brainwash anyone ever again.' Your story sounds incredible. Well, if Hawkman were here, he'd confirm it. Oh, I'm sure he would. And I'm sure he does. [laughs] Coming up next more action-packed adventures  with Aquaman King of the Seven Seas. Featuring Aqualad  and Tusky the Walrus. [neighing] (male narrator)  A strange craft  floats out of the sky and comes to rest  on the surface of the sea. Moments later in an underwater valley  below the craft two scuba divers  place a time bomb and swim swiftly  out of the valley. [theme music] (male narrator) In a narrow canyon nearby,  two other divers drop a curtain of pink plastic material. [zapping] This ray will make it invisible. (male #1) 'Quick, into the globe.' In the craft's control room,  the scuba divers report to the sky-borne scourge  of the sea, Captain Sly. We've set the sea-snares, Captain Sly. Good! The bomb should go off any moment. Draw Aquaman and his friends into our invisible traps and then goodbye, Sea King. [laughs] [bomb ticking] boom My plan worked beautifully. 'Now, that Aquaboob and his friends' 'are moving right into my trap.' Hold it, Aqualad. I'll reconnoiter the canyons alone. 'Wait here till I send for you.' Okay, Aquaman. Ugh! [neighing] It's a trap, come on. Great whales! What hit me? You hit it! An invisible plastic panel. Whoever set this trap may be getting away. - I'll go after him myself. - No, Aqualad, wait. Better follow him. Ah! Here's something invisible. Gallopin' guppies! A plastic bag? (Captain Sly) 'Ha-ha!' 'Bagged him like a store-bought goldfish.' Lower the grabber globe, hurry. Uh-oh. Great whales! They've got Aqualad. [neighing] 'This razor-edged clam ought to do it.' Up, Storm, up. [neighs] [intense music] swoosh (Captain Sly) Blast that Aquaman. Descend to surface. All hands, prepare for underwater attack. We'll soon have lots of help, fellas. [beeping] Too tight. Stand back, team. 'Maybe the swordfish can pry open.' No good. Let's try another fish. 'Remoras!' Alright. Now pull, suckerfish. Pull! [creaking] There, that does it. [whimpers] (Aquaman) 'Good work, Tusky.' Phew! Now I know what an egg yolk feels like. Let's get going, team.

That's right, tadpole. And he got him. Poor Tusky. No, poor Captain Sly. Look! Please, be a good walrus. Let me go. (Aqualad) Enough fun, Tusky. What do we do with the flying Sly boys, Aquaman? They'll be grounded permanently in a prison on the mainland. Alright! Let's scoot for home. crash [barking] [theme music]
