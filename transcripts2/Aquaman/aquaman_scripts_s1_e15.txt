 Robot swordfish. Dive, Aqualad! Fast. neigh Those two marine marvels will be taken care of by my robot beauties. [laughing] Now, I can move on to Atlantis which is gem of the oceans. [laughing] [buzzing] Those robots are catching up. Hop off, Tadpole. We'll meet up head on. [buzzing continues] (male narrator)  Faster and faster  swims Aquaman in a tight circle as the robot menace  tries to overtake him. [music continues] kaboom Now, where's Aqualad? Sufferin' shellfish! It's tryin' to wreck me up on the razor coral. Its eyes, minnow. Cover the eyes. Yeah, maybe that's the key. Soarin' sailfish! We're headin' for that cliff. Get off, Aqualad. Fast! kaboom Wow! That was too close. Nice work, minnow. (Aquaman) Come on, team. Let's go find the source of those robots. Now, for part two of operation robots unlimited. [chuckles] [water gurgling] (male narrator) Now, riding out from Atlantis,  comes fair-haired Mera. Oh! Isn't it beautiful? [barking] Shush, Tusky. What's the matter with you? [barking] (male narrator)  Now, as the impetuous girl  touches the giant replica.. Good grief! A whole armada of robot fish! [barking] Quick, Tusky. Let's get out of here. Ha-ha! Perfect. She's leading them right toward Atlantis. Once in range, the remote relay will take over and.. [laughs] Kaboom! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. [barking] Leapin' ladyfish. 'More robots.' And Mera is leading them right at Atlantis. 'We need help to turn them away.' [dramatic music] (male narrator)  Now, metal dolphin  meets real dolphin. Robot hammer-head  hits living shark. Metallic manta  slams flesh-and-blood ray in a battle royal. Give it to 'em, troops. Come on, tadpole. Let's join the fight. [music continues] kaboom We're not stoppin' 'em. They're getting closer to Atlantis. Great whales! It's Dr. Lamprey. 'He is controlling them from his man-of-war.' - How can we penetrate that? - We can't. But maybe I can stop him from sending commands from it. (male narrator)  Now, in response  to Aquaman's summons a group of torpedo rays surround Dr. Lamprey's  floating lab and bombard it with  a band of electricity. [laughing] You won't jam my robot controller that way. 'Because it's not even here.' Now, my big guns. It's not working. The control is not in Lamprey's lab. It could be anywhere in the seven seas. Check, sardine. I've got to stop that. Aquaman, look! Torpedo fish. (Aquaman) 'Come on. The troops need us.' You help the fish, I'll handle those babies. kaboom [whooshing] Gotcha! If one of those hits Atlantis, it's goodbye dome. (male narrator)  Now, the sea king creates  a wall of hard water and sends it rolling ahead. That didn't stop all of them either. Watch out, Aquaman! Stay away, Aqualad. swoosh Didn't work. What will I do now? [beeping] Got no choice. Must chance it. [intense music] kaboom What caused the robot fish to wreck themselves? (Aquaman) There's the answer, tadpole. Good old Tusky found the controller for those robots, and clobbered it. (Aqualad) 'Tusky, you're a hero!' (Aquaman) 'Look, Dr. Lamprey's had enough.' 'His robot raiders are so much junk now.' There's Mera. Come on, you big beautiful thing. Come on, Mera. It's no use. That thing's bigger than all of us. [both laughing] (male narrator) In just a moment, we'll return  with another exciting adventure featuring a guest star from the galaxy  of super-super heroes. [theme music] (male narrator) Carter Hall, scientific genius  from a far off world flies into action as  Hawkman, winged wonder with Skreal,  his faithful fighting mascot with his arsenal  of phenomenal powers against all earthly  and inter-planetary forces. Hawkman, the winged avenger. [theme music] (male narrator)  Plummeting down out of space,  a strange craft appears in the night sky, over Earth. Banish us from Jupiter, will they, eh? Well, we'll show them, eh, Den-O? Affirmative. Ready dimension ray. Fire! zap (male narrator)  At that moment, Skreal,  Hawkman's pet bird sits atop the Magnus building. Midway city's  tallest skyscraper. Suddenly.. screech [theme music] That should shake up the Earth people, eh, Den-O, eh? Yes, Rap-O. Now, we can make them our slaves. (male narrator)  Moments later in a space lab  on the outskirts of the city where he is known as  scientist, Carter Hall Hawkman receives  an unexpected visitor. Skreal! You know better than to come here. (man on radio) 'Hawkman. Calling Hawkman.' Police radio. 'We're being attacked from outer space.' So that's what you were trying to tell me, eh, Skreal? To the Hawkship, Skreal. Let's go! (male narrator)  Rocketing up  into the atmosphere the winged avenger  and his bird ally enter the Hawkship and take off  in search of invaders. It's Hawkman, Rap-O. He's coming for us. Hawkman, eh? Send him out of this world with the dimension ray, eh, Den-O? Ready. Fire! [zapping] (male narrator) Struck by the evil pranksters'  dimension ray space itself shatters  around Hawkman's ship. Then, the energy of particles  converge, and Hawkman is.. Gone! Ha-ha. Into dimension 23 with our other enemies, eh? No one now can stop us from ruling Earth. [laughing] [crackling] Great galaxies! Where are we? Maybe the Radiotron can tell us. (automated voice) 'Location, Dimension 23. Danger! Danger!' Dimension 23? Come on, Skreal. Let's have a look. (male narrator) Stepping down, Hawkman's foot  energizes the crystal surface. And in a split second,  he is surrounded by living electricity. The proton people  of Dimension 23. - Invaders! Invaders! - Invaders! Invaders! zap Stay out of their range, Skreal. They can't break contact with the crystal surface so they can't reach us here. zap zap [intense music] [screeching] zap [crackling] (male narrator)  Meanwhile, back on the world  in our dimension.. People of Earth, you are now the slaves of Den-O.. And Rap-O, from Jupiter. You have seen what we have done with your skyscraper. And your Hawkman, eh? Both sent to Dimension 23. 'From which there is no return, ever.' From now on, you will do our bidding, eh? What're we going to do? I'm afraid, gentleman, we're at their mercy. [crackling] Who, who are you? We are from Jupiter. Sent here by Den-O and Rap-O as you were. But, why? How? They are evil pranksters banished from our planet. We were transporting them to our prison asteroid when they overpowered us. Turned our own dimension ray on us. Then made off with our ship. We better get out of here. Maybe my electroclaw can.. zap [grunts] - You cannot escape. - You must be destroyed. [music continues] Skreal! He can help. - Death to the invaders! - Death to the invaders! Skreal, bring the lightning rod from the Hawkship. Hurry! [crackling continues] - There is little time left. - We are doomed. If this crazy dimension responds to basic physics and if Skreal gets here in.. Here he comes. 'Drop the rod, Skreal. Now!' boing [crackling] (Hawkman) 'It worked!' The proton people are trapped in a lightning rod. Come on. To my ship. [dramatic music] screech You two see if you can convert my tracer to your dimension ray! Can do, Hawkman. We reverse its polarity. Then test it on the Earth building. Great. Wait for the blast-off. whoosh zap zap zap Hawkman! He's come back. Quick, Den-O. Fire the green cloud, eh? He'll never see us. (male narrator)  Using the magno-power  of his radar eyes Hawkman penetrates  the green fog. And torpedoing directly to them blasts the Hawkship  out of their trap with electromagnetic power. What do we do now, Den-O, eh? Quick, activate the dimension ray. Then let's get out of here. [zapping] zap zap Let's singe their wings, Din-O, eh? boom screech First to make them release Skreal with my repeller ray. zap Now, into the dimension ray with you, scoundrels! No, not that, not that, no! [crackling] Safe journey back to Jupiter, captain. Good luck! Thank you, Hawkman, for everything. Okay, Skreal, next dimension.. ...Midway city. Hold. (male narrator)  Coming up next,  more action-packed adventures with Aquaman,  king of the seven seas featuring Aqualad  and Tusky the walrus. [instrumental music] [neighing] (male narrator)  Not far from Atlantis,  five strange undersea crafts ply to a silent stop. Commanding the Portilla is the villainous mermaid,  Queen Vassa. Attention, all mermen. Ship number three will remain here on guard. All others will activate laser beam drills and tunnel up into Atlantis...now! [whirring] [Vassa laughing] Even the brilliant Aquaman will not expect an attack from beneath the city. (male narrator)  As Vassa's ship tunnel  toward Atlantis the Aquateam and Mera  are inside the dome city visiting the minister  of defense. You say that Obelisk is the key to your new defense warning system? - That's right, Aquaman. - How does it work? It's simple, Aqualad. When there's danger, the crystal ball flashes. Buzzin' barracuda! It's flashing now. (Mera) 'Good grief!' Aquaman, look! A geyser of water! (Aqualad) 'And there's another one. And another.' (Aquaman) Sir, order your people to the rooftops at once. That goes for you too, Mera. Come on, tadpole. To the Aquacave. Look, Aquaman. Unidentified submarine. Southeast. Let's ride. [theme music] [neighing] [barking] (merman #1) 'Number three to number one. Aquaman approaching fast.' (Vassa on phone) 'Use your laser beam drill. Attack and destroy. Over!' (Aqualad) Could that be one of Queen Vassa's new ships, Aquaman? (Aquaman) 'Must be.' (Aqualad) 'Look! Look, what's that?' It's trouble. Scatter. crash [beeping] [whirring] bam [whirring] boom Mermen! Let's go get 'em. Later, minnow. First, we've got to save Atlantis. (male #1) The flood is rising rapidly. Soon our rooftops will be under water. Darn it! I want to see what Aquaman's doing. No, Mera, no! Hold it, Aqualad. Holy haddock! Another one. (Aquaman) 'And more.' Four ships. Yipes! (Aquaman) Separate, fast! [squealing] [barking] boom boom boom boom Leapin' lungfish! Look alive, now. That Atlantian girl, Mera is directly below our ship. 'Capture her with the Vassian vortex.' [whirring] Help! Aquaman! Yes, I know, Tusky. Vassa is in that ship. Someone else? Mera? Aquaman is down there. Quick, get him! [whirring] (male narrator)  Trapped in the powerful  Vassian vortex which draws him upward  toward the open hatch the sea king exerts  his great strength. Slowly every muscle strained  almost to bursting. Aquaman momentarily  stops the vortex. Then causes it  to reverse itself with ever increasing speed. It's spinning backwards! (merman #2) 'Incredible.' boom Burned out! Must get out of here. Vassa's leaving. Gotta get Mera. 'Great whales! Aqualad's surrounded.' With its steering rudder gone, it'll keep going forever. boom Let's get the others. [dramatic music] boom Aquaman! Help! A direct hit on the rudder should turn the trick. swish Uh-oh! It turned it toward me! What luck! Aquaman turned the ship toward himself. No, he'll be killed! Out of my way! click [whirring] boom You'll pay for this, you little water-witch! 'Chain her to the bulk-head.' Now, I will personally destroy Aquaman! 'Activate the laser beam drill.' Okay, we meet. Come and get me! [whirring] She bored her way in. Now, she'll bore her way out. crash [dramatic music] - Ah! - Greetings, Your Majesty. Aquaman? You'll get more of the same if you don't release Mera at once! Oh, Aquaman! Am I glad to see you. I demand justice. You'll get it, queeny. In Atlantis. What are the giant rays for, Aquaman? (Aquaman) 'To plug up the holes temporarily' and stop the flood in Atlantis. (minister) Aquaman, you've stopped the floods. Yes. And here's your culprit, sir. Her Royal Highness, Queen Vassa. You are a vile woman, Vassa. And you shall be severely punished. The first part of their punishment 'is to help pump Atlantis dry.' What a beautiful picture. (Aquaman) 'And only fair too.' [all laughing] clap clap clap [theme music] [music continues] [instrumental music]
