[theme music] (male narrator) In just a moment we'll return  with another exciting adventure featuring a guest star from the galaxy  of super superheroes. Through the magic alchemy  of nature's most awesome sources of energy Ray Palmer atomic physicist  becomes...The Atom. A power-packed mighty-mite. Whose brilliant mind and great  strength serve law and order against crime and injustice. Tiny titan,  scourge of evil-doers! The Atom! [dramatic music] [intense music] (male narrator)  Hurtling through Earth's orbital barrier a seemingly harmless meteorite. But in its core,  five tiny beings communicate with a distant world. I've entered Earth's atmosphere. (beetle-man #1) 'Excellent.' 'Remain in concealment' 'until target is reached.' (male narrator)  Reduced by air friction to the size of an average stone it hurtles towards  a vast nuclear lab complex and plunges into the soil. Shortly after,  a sample of that soil is inspected by a group  of atomic scientists. [beeping] What do you make of the intense radioactivity, Prof. Palmer? Well, it's hard to tell without knowing 'where that meteorite came from.' [intense music] [dramatic music] Soon as we break out, move swiftly. We must catch the Earthlings off-guard. (male #1) Look at those strange little beetles, they.. Great neutron! Look out! zap zap zap You two, lock them away. The rest follow me. (male narrator)  Now imprisoned  in a giant vault Professor Ray Palmer  is the first to recover from the stun blasts. And seconds later  he is transformed into the world's  most powerful miniature man. The Atom. Now I can get out of here. swoosh Through that lock. Great molecules! 'They're programming the computers' 'for a chain reaction' to blow up that atomic pile. I've gotta stop it. Look. A tiny Earthling comes to challenge us. Stamp him out like an insect. [instrumental music] Got a message for you too, buddy boy. Ahh! zap zap Hah! Just the thing. Used to be pretty good at tossing javelins. Here you go! [both screaming] Keep him at bay. Just a few more seconds and our mission is accomplished. [screams] I have him trapped. - Peekaboo! - Ow! Now, the control panel. There. It is done. Too late, the chain reaction's begun. Only seconds to go. Got to intercept it. Stop him! Stop him! 'Even if it means your lives.' Maybe I can cut out these transistors. Get out! Get out! Or we both die. I'm too young...to die. [beetle-man groaning] [beetle-man screaming] Reaction's past transistor pace. Must smash those photoelectric cells. Which way now, little bug? This way, pal! [screams] Reaction's in final phase. Each reaching blast level. [intense music] This is my last chance to short it out. [electricity crackling] boom The tiny Earthling has foiled our mission. Let's get out of here. [dramatic music] Don't go away, fellas. Uh-oh! Ow! Hey! Stand aside or we shall burn you to a cinder. [intense music] boom Run! Run! Going somewhere, boys? This jar will hold 'em till the authorities get here. They came to destroy all of Earth's atomic piles making us an easy mark for invasion. Hmm. I don't think their leaders will ever try that stunt again. No. Not as long as they have The Atom to reckon with. [upbeat music] (male narrator)  Coming up next.. More action packed adventures  with Aquaman. King of the Seven Seas. Featuring Aqualad  and Tusky the walrus. [neighing] [dramatic music] [barking] (male narrator)  As Tusky, the walrus, swims  playfully along the sea floor he suddenly spies  a strange phenomena. A pool of poisonous  pink liquid. Cautiously avoided  by all sea creatures. [intense music] [growling] (male narrator)  The amazed Walrus  is spellbound by the sight of the crimson giant,  rising out of the pink pool. [growling] [barking] [growling] thud [intense music] [barking] [beeping] (Aqualad) Look, Aquaman. Something's causing those reefs to disappear. Whatever it is, it's heading for Atlantis. Let's go. [dramatic music] [Tusky barking] Maybe he's seen what we spotted on the scope. He has. Lead us to it, Tusky boy. [dramatic music] Holy halibut! What in sea blazes is that? I don't know, Tadpole. But whatever it is, it's heading straight for Atlantis. [growling] (Aqualad) 'Soarin' sailfish!' 'That monster's got the strength of ten whales.' (Aquaman) 'At least.' That's a dissolving acid. A powerful chemical. Yeah, it could burn a hole in the dome that would destroy Atlantis. Right. We've got to stop it somehow before it gets there. [intense music] Aquaman, look. He tripped. He's down. Stay put. All of you. Tusky, no! Come back. [growling] Charge, Imp! [intense music] It's gonna send that clam into pink oblivion. Not if I can help it. thud thud thud Gotcha! Hold him, Aquaman! We'll take care of him. bang Come on, octopi, I need you now. [sonic beeping] [dramatic music] Well, I'll be.. The octopus ink has turned it blue. slam Aquaman! Aqualad, watch out! [intense music] Oh! How come we're not dissolved? The octopus ink has neutralized the pink acid. Yippee! He's lost his sting. Now let me at 'em. Help! Aquaman! He's lost his sting, but not his strength. I'd better get more help. [sonic beeping] [dramatic music] crash thump [grunting] [growling] thud - Here, grab hold, Tadpole. - What do I do with it? Get over to that whale over there and lasso that monster 'when I say go.' [growling] This ought to stop you long enough. Now, Tadpole! Go! [growling] Now let's take big boy for a ride. Go, fellas! Go! [growling] [dramatic music] That's it. Bombs away! [intense music] Now the pool is neutralized too. And this area is safe for fish again. Check. Look. What's that? A very rare sea creature. A pink eel. [whimpering] [Tusky whimpering] (Aqualad) Tusky! Tusky! Come back! [Aquaman laughing] [theme music] [music continues]
