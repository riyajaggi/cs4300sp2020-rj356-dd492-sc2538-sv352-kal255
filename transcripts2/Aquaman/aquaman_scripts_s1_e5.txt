He's trapped inside his own water wall. Now, Imp! [roaring] [Ice Dragon roaring] [barking] Thanks, Tadpole. This deep-freeze monster is too much. We need help. (male narrator)  From the Sea King's brain  telepathic commands radiate. Stay here, Storm. (Aqualad) You too, Imp. Now, Aqualad, let's get that monster.

Hit the brink, Tusky. splash thud [roaring] Aquaman, what now? (Aquaman) 'Look out!' (Aquaman) Great gastropods! It's turned the sea surface to ice. Into the water, quick! [barking] - Yipes! - I've got you, Tadpole. [roaring] [roaring] [barking] [growling] Oh, no! It froze Tusky. (male narrator)  Trapped within  the solid ice block.. ...Aquaman issues a telepathic  command to his loyal fish. [roaring] splash [roaring] - Oh, boy! That feels better. - Come on, Aqualad. Let's find that dragon before he creates more havoc. [roaring] Grab the horses, Aqualad. I'll handle Mr. Dragon. [roaring] [roaring] So you wanna play rough, eh? How's this?

You'll see in a minute, Aqualad. Stand back. (male narrator)  As Aquaman spins  at fantastic speed creating a wall of water  inside the ice cave the stunned dragon revives. Aquaman, watch out! [roaring] [roaring] Leapin' lionfish! He's sealed himself into that iceberg. Yes. That ought to hold him for a while. Now, another job for the whales. [dramatic music] There. The ocean current will take our dragon friend into Arctic waters, where he'll stay in cold storage forever. Cool, Aquaman. Real cool. [barking] - What's that? - It's Tusky. We forgot about him. thud I'm sorry, Tusky. [barking] [laughing] [barking] Okay. Okay! I said I'm sorry, didn't I? [barking] [theme music] (male narrator)  In just a moment, we'll return with another exciting adventure featuring a guest star from  the galaxy of super superhero. Through the magic alchemy  of nature's most awesome sources of energy,  Ray Palmer, atomic physicist becomes...the Atom a power-packed mighty mite. Whose brilliant mind  and great strength serve law and order  against crime and injustice. Tiny Titan, scourge  of evil-doers, the Atom. [instrumental music] A chartered plane  bearing members of Ivy University's  Science Faculty approaches a small island on which they plan  to establish a research center. What do you think of the location, Professor Palmer? Well, it appears to be ideal, Professor Brown, but.. ...I'm puzzled by the weird plant life down there. (male narrator) Now, from a high vantage point  on the island angry eyes, observe  the plane's approach. They're going to land, Strail. No one, but no one, must discover what I'm doing here. 'They've got to be destroyed.' (male narrator)  As Strail flicks a switch electronic impulses  activate giant plants. Clouds of spores,  burst from their flowers and drift with the wind. [dramatic music] [sputtering] - What happened? - Don't know. Engine's gone haywire. (male narrator)  Unnoticed amid the confusion Professor Ray Palmer  activates a secret belt switch. And in a flash, he's reduced  to the tiny power packed form of the Atom. Must get to the engines fast. We're starting to lose altitude. Plant spores. So that's what causing all the trouble. Oh! We're in a dive. We're plunging toward the sea. We're doomed. We're gonna be killed. [all screaming] It's now or never. There she goes. [intense music] Oh, one of the engines is working again. Glory be! They made it. They're landing. Now they'll regret they ever saw this island. I'm...suddenly...sleepy. Brain feels numb. Strange gas. Can't fight it. Ha-ha. They're all knocked out. Now, go get them. Sure thing, boss. (male narrator)  A short time later,  the Atom revives and is shocked  to find himself alone. Where's everybody gone? So you see, gentlemen, I cannot risk permitting you to leave this island alive. Great electrons! They've been taken prisoner. The world is not yet ready to learn 'of my brilliant experiments which combines' 'electronic wave patterns with plant growth.' (Prof. Brown) 'Incredible.' 'But why are you keeping them' 'such a deep dark secret?' [yowling] (Strail) 'He-he. It's simple.' 'Because when I'm ready' 'I shall use them to gain wealth.' 'Power!' Hey...who lifted my gun? Someone else is in here. Find him! What the.. It's the Atom. Catch him, destroy him. Head's up. [grunts] [yowling] - Dig this. - Oh! Ah. [meow] Which way did he go? [Atom screaming] No! I don't believe it! You better believe it, mister. Caught you, little man. Now, Mr. Atom 'prepare to fight the final battle of your life.' [zapping] Ha! Think you can get past that voltage? Hmm? Great molecules! These plants are alive. Ha-ha-ha. Right. But you won't be for long. [laughing] Great show, little man. Great show. [laughing] crash A concentrated atomic pellet! That's what gives these plants their life force. [explosion] Holy smokes! He destroyed them! (Strail) 'Stop. Stay where you are.' This bomb is loaded with powerful explosives. (Strail) 'Take one more step and..' Sic 'em, kitty. Got it. pow pow pow 'Let me out!' Yes, sir. Just as soon as the Coast Guard gets here. [dramatic music] Thank heaven for the Coast Guard. My thanks go to the Atom. Agreed. But how did the Atom get out of here? Yes. And where were you, Palmer? Gentlemen, surely you don't think I'm the Atom. [chuckles] Hmm. Not very likely. Of course not. Anyone but Professor Palmer. 'Lets go, gentlemen.' (male narrator) Coming up next, more action  packed adventures with Aquaman. King of the Seven Seas. Featuring Aqualad  and Tusky the walrus. [neighing] The calm serenity  of the bottom of the sea is suddenly rocked  by tremors and quakes. kaboom Which create yawning chasms  in the undersea floor. In the Aquacave, his  oceanographic warning system alerts Aquaman,  King of the Seven Seas. Must be an undersea earthquake. And.. Great guppies! Aqualad is in that sector. Go, Storm, go. [theme music] Whoa, Imp! Feels like an earthquake. Come on, Tusky, lets check it out. We should be safe up here. [whirring] Sufferin' sailfish! 'Just look at those diamond drills.' 'They cut through solid rock as if it were cardboard.' (male narrator)  Now, deep down many miles  below the sea...the Mole Men a weird race of mutants with a highly developed  civilization monitor the progress  of their bore craft. Sir, advanced units have penetrated into the sea. Excellent. Alert main force to stand ready. [rumbling] Pull, Tusky. Pull. I'm trapped. My foot's stuck. Hope Aquaman.. ...is on his way to investigate this. Aqualad in trouble. [rumbling] The crevice is snapping shut. Unless Aquaman gets here soon, Tusky, I'm a goner. (male narrator)  Assessing the situation  at a glance the Sea King issues  a telepathic command to a school of blowfish. Too late, Aquaman. This crevice is closing fast. Grab these blowfish, Tadpole. We'll have you out in a second. (male narrator)  Now as the inflated blowfish hold the line  for a precious few seconds. Aquaman dives in  to extricate Aqualad's foot. Hurry, Aquaman. Hurry! (Aquaman) 'Up, you go.' What in Neptune's name is that? That's one of the strange things that caused the earthquake, Aquaman. (Aquaman) 'I've gotta find out just what this is.' 'Stay put, all of you.' That was too close. I need help. (male narrator)  Once again the marine marvel  summons an undersea ally. Now, you're in for a shocking experience. [crackling] Bore-craft 109 destroyed. Order Bore-craft 363 to capture him at once. Aqualad, warn Atlantis to be alert for attack. Take off. Check. [dramatic music] Welcome, water creature. So these are remote-controlled robot ships. - And you are? - I am Agnama. King of the Mole Men and you are my prisoner. Really? What do you plan to do with me? Bring you back to our lab in the center of the Earth. That's what you think. [laughing] 'Not even the hard shell of Atlantis...can withstand' 'our diamond drills.' [evil laughter] [dramatic music] Jumpin' jellyfish! It's an invasion. Where's Aquaman? Once this thing starts back into the Earth, I've had it. There must be a way out. Torpedo tubes. That's it. I'll set it to fire in three seconds. If I'm lucky. [dramatic music] Now, to Atlantis. (male narrator)  Streaking to the rescue Aquaman orders his sea troops to fall in and follow him  into battle. Aquaman and the troops. Hurray! (Aquaman) 'These things are programmed' 'to attack anything in their way.' 'So..' [dramatic music] [explosion] They've destroyed over half the fleet. We will lose them all. Recall the invasion fleet. Recall them at once. Look, Aquaman, they're turning tail. Let's get 'em. No, I think they've had enough. (Aqualad) 'But, Aquaman..' I'm calling off my fish allies. Let 'em go. Guess you're right. They probably won't try anything like this again. Not for a while anyhow. What's that? thump thump [laughing] (Aqualad) 'Come on back, Tusky. The fight's over.' [instrumental music] [theme music] [music continues]
