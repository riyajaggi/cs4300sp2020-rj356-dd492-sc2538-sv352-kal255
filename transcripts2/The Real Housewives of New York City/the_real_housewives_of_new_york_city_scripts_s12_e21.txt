When you mentioned I should put this on the market, okay, I talked to my daughter, and she agreed... You sunk some big money in here, girl. At this point, this house is nothing more than a financial drain, an emotional drain. All this carpet will be white. I know. I love it. I wanna be footloose, fancy-free. I have worked so hard to get to this point. I don't wanna be house-heavy. - Did you track it? - Ooh, I love it. This is the most important floor. Sonja, I love this room. I love it. It's different now, right? Yeah, I love it. Oh, my God, I love it. There's nothing... I'm not... There's nothing I think you should change. I reupholstered the heirloom furniture. Oh! I love this chaise. Now that my daughter is in college, I certainly don't need all this house for one person. Bathroom's great. This place is ready to be taken on by a new family and make it their own. Sonja, I'm proud of you. No, I really am, because I know how hard it is. You know, you are even more attached to this townhouse than I was attached to my apartment, and I didn't even realize how attached I was to my apartment until I-I was closing on it. Well, it's your badge of honor that you accomplished this... - And all... - ...and bought this. No, I never really looked at it like that. - No? - I looked at it more of, like, this is where my daughter brings all her friends, and it was like, stability for her... - I understand. - ...during the divorce. - It was home. - But once she got to college, it wasn't like boarding school where people would come and stay like that. It's different. Live your life in the moment now. Don't... L.L.... "Living Life." That's my new mantra. - "Living Life." - L.L. We're gonna L.L., girl. You're gonna get rid of this, and we're gonna be L.L. We're gonna be all over the world together. Well, that's the thing, yes. I'm ready now for my place, just for me. A little garden, maybe a fireplace. That's about it, and my big bathtub and a 4-poster bed. I love the carpet. Can I copy this for my bedroom? - I like it. - Oh, my God. Lie down and take a picture. Your shirt matches this. - Look at this rug. - Oh, my God. Actually... Oh, yeah, I do like that. Butt looks good. But put your arms over your head like you did, yeah.

I kind of refuse to do it. - [ laughs ] - I'm scared. I have a good suggestion for the two of you, though. What? I don't know if you wanna hear it. No, I do wanna hear it. Oh, I know what you're gonna say. - What? - What is it? - No phone. - Might be a good idea. Yeah, maybe I'll take a little detox from social media. That would be a nice thing, right? I really do appreciate my mom looking out for Kier and me. No matter how tumultuous my relationship is with Bunny at times, family is the most important thing to me, and I don't take that for granted. Kiki, I wish you would come to, like, the Mob party, just for an hour. - But it already happened. - First one. Well, you missed Grandma's speech. Oscar-worthy. - Oh, stop it. - It was, Mom. It was really good. [ amplified voice ] Thank God Leah followed her dream because I certainly couldn't have given her any inspiration about this. - Congratulations.

But Dorinda's not coming 'cause she had hand surgery. - Okay, she gets a pass. - Absolutely. Obviously. Ramona just told Luann today that she's not showing up. You wait and tell her on the day of her performance that you can't come? Why didn't you do it when she sent the invite out? That's bullsh... I haven't been around a while, but it does seem that these ladies are sick of cabaret. Like, I have not seen any cabaret, so she's got a new audience member here. - Yeah, this. - Wait, what's...

It's all-new material, and it's really based on sex and relationships, all of those fun things that, um, I never really talk about. - Thank you. - Oh, see, do have... Do you have any new year's resolutions? Um, you know, my track record at that time of year isn't really that great. - Oh. [ laughter ] So you know, this holiday season, I thought, you know, I'd try not to get married, divorced, or arrested. [ gong resonates ] [ laughter ] - Boring! - [ cheering ] - [ laughs ] I really feel this "Marry, [bleep], Kill" thing is Luann's idea of how to refresh the cabaret. I just got back from a trip with my girlfriends in Mexico. - [ cheering ] - Yeah! And I didn't fall into one bush! - [ laughs ] - [ laughs ] The material's getting old. Just saying. I gotta tell you guys, I've got a problem. Every time I go out, somebody asks me if I'm gonna get married again, and every time I go out, I see Harry Dubin, and he asks me if I'm gonna get married again. If Harry Dubin asks me one more time if I'm gonna get married again, I'm gonna have to kill him. No, Lu, don't kill Harry! Oh, come on, Sonja. I was just joking. I have a solution to your problem. Okay, Sonja-rita. Myself, I'm impromptu, so I don't have to have a shtick. Come on up here, Sonja. Everybody... [ cheers and applause ] - The Sonja Morgan.

[ audience groans and laughs ] Second divorce, which has some, uh... Oh, sh... [ laughs ] And then that leaves me having sex with Dorinda, who may be a sleeper hit in the bed. Oh! [ laughs ] People pleasure. "Marry, [bleep], Kill" is nothing new either. Some of us have... ed everybody. So... the list gets short. I love you guys. Thank you so much for coming tonight to our little preview of "Marry, F, Kill." You've been a great audience. I love you. Thank you, Sonja Morgan, for being my guest. Love you guys. [ cheering ] I thought it was great. I thought it was a treat, getting to see Sonja and Luann perform together, so I don't know why Ramona wouldn't wanna come. All right, let's open some champagne. Did you like it? Wasn't that fun? You know what? I'm happy Ramona's not here, honestly, because guess what? I can chew gum, and I can show my vagina to everybody without being judged for it!

I thought you were a gay friend. We... We made out, like, six years ago at Beautique. - Six years ago at Beautique? - Yeah. - Oh, so you maybe you were... - That makes sense. Well, you did say I made out with random men at Beautique, and I said I didn't, so maybe you were right. - Yeah. I mean, I'm delighted to see Ron. At least he wasn't missing. You're supportive, Ramona. You wouldn't come last night. He was seated between you and me. You didn't tell me you weren't coming. Luann... I didn't get your invitation till Friday. - You knew about it in Mexico. - No, I did not. You missed a great show. No, you were terrible not coming. Warm champagne. And did she steal any of your jokes, or did you go with your old jokes? - Ah, I was... Okay. It was like, "Harry, Dick or Sam or Paul." - Harry wasn't even there. - No, that... that joke? - Oh, yeah, we used that joke. - That's a good... Oh, yeah, that was her joke, right? - I've been with Harry... - I wrote it. - No, I wrote that. - Yeah, no, I wrote that. No, I wrote it. I've been saying it for 10 years. - Sonja wrote that joke. - You stole that joke. - No, I wrote it. - It's okay. You can have it. You can have the dick, too. Well, as for Ramona, though, I really don't know... Wow, Le... Lu... I think of how happy she is. She didn't even tell me she wasn't coming last night. I know! I told her. I mean, that's rude. See, look. I didn't see it. It just said, "Hey, girls. Happy birthday. Uh, hope... I know she can't make it." That's all I saw and s... That's all I saw. I never touch that. I didn't know. Well, that's the attachment, the invitation. The heading didn't say, "See my... come to my cabaret show." - I always show up for you. - I know you do. But I'm just giving you business advice. When you want someone to come, on the header, you say, "Please come to my show." Well, my business advice... Open the attachment. How's that? That's my business advice to you. No, I don't have time to open attachments. - Open the attachment. - I don't have time to open attachments. Luann didn't tell me till last minute. [ goofy voice] "Oh, by the way, I'm doing a cabaret thing. Can you come?" [ normal voice ] Like, no, sorry. I have a commitment already. Like, can you give me, like, like, a few days' notice? - Leah, you're so quiet. - Who, me? [ laughs ] Yeah, what's going on? - Well, you know... - Need some tequila? - No, she's, uh... - [ laughs ] She's doing... I'm not doing recall. I know a little bit about Ron. I know that he gets horny at 2 in the afternoon. You made out with my friend last night. You made out with her friend last night. - I don't even know. - He doesn't remember. I even have a text message that she sent me that you were gonna [bleep] the life out of her. - That's what you said. - She does? [ laughter ] - Oh! Are you and Ramona on a date right now? No. She's my friend. I never even kissed her. Swear to God. I swear. Well, there's always tonight. - It's platonic? - Super platonic. I can tell that he's the kind of guy that probably wants to bang 25-year-olds. Let's be honest here, but I think Ramona likes just straight male energy, and he definitely has that. You brought a statement there 'cause you're in a statement hat. - I did. - The hat... - It's great for your face. - Gorgeous. - Thank you. - I want that hat. Wait. You guys are just platonic? - Yeah. - Why? Because he's, you know... Why not? [ laughs ] We will explore. It's better that way. We're just friends. Yeah, but you're looking also for... Yeah, but he's not... He's not gonna be for me. I've got some things in the oven. - Don't worry about me. - Oh! Okay! I've got some things I'm working on still, baby. [ singsongy ] Turtle Time! - I got some stuff going on. - [ laughs ] - Oh, yeah. - I'm sure you do. [ laughs ] You don't understand what she did here. What did she do? She was looking for the green light. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - No, you wanna go out with her. Don't flatter yourself. Are you crazy?! - You know... - I actually love being single. Listen, there's nothing wrong with being single, but it's still... People need... I have friends. - Friends with benefits? - Yeah. - No, no, no, no. - Oh, God. No, don't say that to Ramona. Oh, my God! - Don't talk about that. Aah! - It's good. She acts like this with you? The second I say anything... - No. Because I will not... - She's like, "Oh! Oh! Because I will never talk to her like that. You're at your prime right now. - I know. - I can make you shine. Okay. Thank you. - Cheers. [ glasses clink ] Disgusting. We're gonna get started in just a little bit. - Thank you so much. - I, uh... Oh, we're actually playing Bingo? Cool. I guess so. Yes, it's quite a... It's a leap. [ laughs ] Uh, before we start the games, the number one message is tonight is benefiting the LGBTQ+ community. [ cheers and applause ] And I wanted to just say I don't know why you bring a straight guy to an LGBTQ... You... Okay, it did not say on the invitation "gay only." It says, "Bring your best friend drag queen." No, it just says... Okay, listen. You said, "I'm not doing that sh..." Open your attachments! You brought the same old people that you always bring! - [ laughs ] These are my best friends, like you! I said, "Don't bring your boring friends. I'm not bringing mine." - They're not boring. - I love them. - Yes, they are. Oh, my God. You ran out of Leah's party. You ran out of Leah's party, too. I'm good. I'm looking... Hold on. - It's all good. - Ramona, Ramona... - Did she just say I'm boring? - Aah! [ laughs ] It says, "Wave your freak flag." Don't blame me for something that's not true. Shh! Let her continue her speech, Ramona. This is terrible, but you know what? I've learned to have a specific, permanent smile on my face so it's not a disaster. All right, here we go. Once you get five in a row, you're gonna get Bingo, and then we are going to move on. - I'm gonna win. - You don't wanna sit down? Shh! It's very serious. Stop. Our first blue ball of the night... [ chuckles ] Shout out to ya. It's G52. - Yes! Yes! - You got it! - Yes! - Wonderful. - Unfortunately... - I am winning! ...she does not have Bingo, but I do appreciate your enthusiasm. Here we go, G58. - Yes! - What?! Yes! Keep it moving! Obviously, when Dorinda's not doing Dorobics, she's at the Elks Lodge playing Bingo, because she is so competitive. - All right, G60. - Yes! Don't say, "Yes" until you get one. I'm getting close, Sonja. Part of winning is winning in your mind first. Is anybody close? Are you close? - I'm close. - Oh! I like 69! - Are you! - Oh, sh...! Ramona! You messed up her card! - Oh, oh. It's all right. - She messed up Dorinda's card. - She sucks. - I wanted 69. No, but I know that's your favorite number. You've got your mind in the gutter about 69 and sex? Like, literally 10 minutes ago, I said "friends with benefits," and that was disgusting to her. This is about the community. It's not about you and your vajayjay. Oh, my Lord. I just like the way "69" looks. It's you have the 6 this way, and the 9 the other way. It's very graphically pretty. All right, B14, B14. Don't say 69. Ramona will lose her... shiz. B14. - Such a ripoff. - You got a Bingo? - [ guests shouting ] - Cheater! I want a callback of your numbers. You want a callback. I need a drink. Dorinda, this is just Bingo. You can lighten up here. I'm in a medical state. I need to be medicated. Okay, we saved the best for last. I've met a lot of drag queens, but I've never seen one with legs as long as Lu's. She has a new hit called "Viva La Diva." - "Viva"? - "Viva La Diva." Oh, she said "Diva." And she's gonna share it with you tonight. - Here you go. - Is that the introduction? [ cheers and applause ] Okay, that's better. That's better. Hi, everybody. Well, it's nice to be here with everybody, first of all, and celebrate the holidays together, and to be supportive of GLAAD and the LGBT community. All you queens are looking fabulous tonight, what can I say? - [ cheering ] I had the... the luck and the honor to work with Desmond Child, "Livin' on a Prayer," Bon Jovi, he's worked with Cher, so we literally came out of the studio just a couple of days ago. This is just a preview for you guys, so... - [ cheering ] - Take it, Lu! So we're still... We're still working on it.

I've grown so much over these last few months, especially getting things right with my mom. I have a newfound love for the Upper East Side. What can I say? And now I feel like I'm in a place where I'm ready to let go of [bleep] boys and possibly even be in a relationship with somebody. ♪♪♪♪♪ You guys have been great girlfriends to me. We have.

Sorry, I'm not part of that. Tinsley... I will not give Tinsley that. [bleep] you. - I won't. - That's bullsh...! Tinsley did sh... Tinsley almost ruined our show. - She had too much to drink. - Oh, my God! You're gonna give a toast to Tinsley Mortimer, who left the show and breached her contract and left over nothing?! - Exactly! I agree! - I won't. - If you're not here, you don't get kudos. - You won't mention her name. - Hello... - I will say whatever I want, actually. - No, [bleep] you. I am a principled person. Yeah, the hand is working pretty well over there. No, it's not... You're... You're spitting all over! You're spitting all over. Merry Christmas. - I won't do it. - You're spitting. Stop. No. Tinsley left the show. She breached the contract. Oh, my God! And just flees from the season. - I invited her tonight. - [bleep] that sh... - Try principle. Try principle. - She went back to Chicago. [bleep] that sh... - Wow. Wow. - Oh, my God. She's, like, obsessed with Tinsley. Go [bleep] herself. All I was saying is that Tinsley left, and, like, it gave me a chance to, like, bond with everybody. - Guess what? - And I love all of you. - Tinsley left. - That's what I'm literally trying to tell her. I love her! And you're... you're still here. - Tinsley didn't... ing sh... Anything... She left us. Yeah, and she's a bitch. Yes. So, like, enjoy you. What is she doing? She's going beyond. Now this is beyond my wildest expectations of her as a person. - This is crazy. I'm really freaked out. We don't want that bitch's name mentioned. - It was a wreck. - I'm gonna go home. - She... - She's... She's got work to do. - I mean... - We all have work to do. When you don't grow, that's a great example over there. What just happened is a great example of not growing. - I'm done. - I'm not. - [ laughs ] - I know it's done. There's a lot of pain and a lot of sh... going on in there. It's coming up. And she wouldn't come to the show after having surgery, come on. She came out to this party. She could've come to my show. No, she could've come to the show. She doesn't wanna come to my show. It's awful. I don't even wanna, like, even deal. Did she leave? I don't wanna be near that energy. I hope she left. Happy... ing holidays. [ laughs ] - I mean, seriously. - Merry Christmas. Merry... ing Christmas. Bitch. - Bitch. - [ laughs ] Next week for the first time since March, we're having an in-person reunion. Hold on, Sonja, you're putting sanitizer on your leg. Yeah, I need a little shine for tonight. Where are you at with dating? - Time will tell. - Are you seeing somebody? - Oh, my God. - You know, we'll see. - We made out. - He's cute. We played pool. He didn't get to see these wings. - [ laughs ] - I have a juicy question. Are you trying to have children? So... Why did 10 people say they saw her body parts? Because your friends are freaking blind! Do you regret the way you behave? You need to be accountable for your actions. Yeah, I know, and I apologized. Way too little, too late. Well, I miss him every single day. [ exhales deeply ] Go with your loser friends. They're a PSA statement for a bad facelift, like yours. STFU. Okay? Ramona is out every single night drinking. - I mean, I do it on video. - I drink water. - Why do you think I'm thin? - You're not that thin. You are disgusting. Oh, my God. Go to church. - People are dying! - Ramona, Ramona... She was running around... People don't wear masks outside. No, you don't have to follow the rules when everybody else does. I followed the rules in Florida, and I'm allowed to come back, bitch! - What did you just say? - And safely! Okay, ladies... I don't wear masks in the ocean! We are responsible for a message!
