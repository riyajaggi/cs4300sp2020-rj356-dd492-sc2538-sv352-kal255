 - Previously on... - So when my parents came to come get me after the three-month rehab, they were like, "you're not coming home." - really? - What? - I was a really... ed-up teenager. "we did find you a halfway house for you to live in that's run by nuns." - waaaaaaah! - Well, of course I'd be upset, but why then would you say that? - Why would you say that? - I was never a trophy wife! Take that back! [overlapping arguing]

 don't get all socialite on me! - Don't get all socialite with me! ♪♪♪ - I'm not always right, but I'm never wrong. - I'm no one's accessory. I'm the whole lifestyle brand. - I don't need to find love. I love myself. - I may float like a butterfly, but I sting like a bitch. - Life isn't a fairy tale, but I'm hoping mine's the exception. - Raise the curtains, lower the lights. I'm taking center stage in my life. ♪♪♪ - these are the final looks, yeah. This would be our wedding final look, right? Classic. - And then there's two more. - Here. Let me come over here so everyone can see.

 We started the fashion line in 2014, debuted at fashion week 2015, and now we're going back to fashion week 2019 with the new fashion collection. - You're gonna die with this one. - Oh! It's so tyra banks! - I gotta practice my walking. - Yes. - Ok. - Oh, that's not it. - Wait. Hold on. - Don't give the shaking with your shoulders. - Hold on, I'm sorry. Just one second, please! Are you ready? I'm gonna cry! - Garo sparo is a fashion designer. He actually was on "project runway," and he's asked me to close out his fashion show this evening. - Oh, my god! She's... - I need a little help. - Oh, you've got it, you've got it. - Because of the back part. - With the sack, I get to wear a crown. It's like the most exciting thing ever. Oh. Oh! - Ready? [laughs] - that feels good. Do you know how tight he's making this? I love it! - I'm excited about the shows. I'm excited about our new show. - Marry 'em, kill 'em. - Marry 'em. Kill, baby. In my cabaret show, I do a q&a; with the audience, and always, without a doubt, I get asked this question. "who would I marry, who would I eff, and who would I kill?" so I decided that is going to be the name of my next show. - It's always about the countess, but... - Yeah. - The countess is now being a little naughty, which I can be. - ♪ everybody dance ♪ - let's exercise our tummy, coco, 'cause that's my problem area... my stomach. - ♪ everybody dance ♪ - fashion week is definitely a major event in new york, and if you don't go to a fashion show, you're considered, like, almost like a leper, so even though I don't like to go as much I used to, I have to go to at least several. Otherwise, I'll be ostracized. [efforting] ♪♪♪ oh, god, that hurts. - My brand is 25 to 45. I'm 55, pushing 70. - No, you are not. Ok, so, um, it's our first show of the new sonja by sonja morgan. It's not the sonja morgan new york collection. It's gonna be good. I've been working all summer on this new fashion collection. This is ready-to-wear, which means everything costs less than $250. Now, who isn't ready to wear that? The show is in a week. I want to know what you guys are gonna do to be ready. We've got the clothes. What about the models? - The models. We, like, have, like, a... a... a bunch of models that we're gonna... [laughs] - you're scaring me. "we have a bunch of models." - a bunch of models. - We have a week for this. Remember that. - No, but can we just use one agency? - We're pulling models from, uh, different agencies, not just one agency. - Why? I like to stick to one agency. Is that a spider? - It is a little tiny spider. - Oh! - Itsy-bitsy spider. - Goodbye! - Tell me it's good luck or something! This is a big hurdle for me and I don't want to mess it up. All the girls are coming. All my designer friends who support me. It's nerve-wracking! - The restaurant section is on the second floor. The second floor is a very long room. It seats 225 people. - We're only gonna have 75. - 75's not enough. Just a gay party at the townhouse is 200 and some. We have dead bodies. We have 75 dead bodies after a party! Sometimes I think team sonja forgets what the reason is for having a fashion show. It's not just to have a flowing bar and great food and to see all your friends. I have a lot of retailers that have been watching me and wanting to buy the collection, so maybe it's time to pull the trigger. I'm so nervous. I'm not gonna sleep tonight. I'm not gonna sleep until the show's over. ♪♪♪ - like, wow, hold on. I gotta duck low. You have to learn how to walk in a crown. ♪♪♪ - all right, this is where the dress is. - Aah! - That's so... it's like... - Oh, my god! - [laughs] - it's so me. - Big hair, big skirt. - I love it! - It's been ten years since you've been doing things like this. - I know. - And I'm happy that you're back doing them. - Thank you, mommy. Thank you. - [laughs] don't make me cry. - I know. I can't cry right now. Like, I literally have to compartmentalize this and take this. Like, I have to... I want to, like, feel, like, confident and, like, be all there again and stuff, okay? - I'm gonna be quiet, but you look like yourself again. That's what made me cry. - Stop! Mommy, please! I can't cry right now. I'm gonna mess up my makeup. - Sorry. I don't want you to. What's wrong with us? - [laughs] there... I... I think there's a lot wrong with us. - So much wrong. - It's really sweet that my mom is being emotional right now. This is something I used to do. This was for the old me, and, you know, I was this "it girl" and I got to walk in these shows and the fact that garo sparo is wanting me to close out his show just means that... makes me feel like I'm just sort of back to being the person that I was before and the person that I kind of feel like I lost when I moved away from new york. - Were you able to walk when you cinched it really tight in the apartment? - Yes, but it was different 'cause it hurt, so it's better than it was in the apartment. - Right. Make sure my... - Let me pull my girdle down. - Making sure my tape is working. - Whew! Doing good! - Can we check in? - No more rose all day! - [laughs] - hi! - How are you? - Any questions you want to ask garo about your walk? - No! - I know, please. - I don't even know about this designer, do you? What's it like, the designer? - Full, like, gowns. Like, very, like, avant-garde looking. - Hey, gorgeous! - Yay! - Ooh! Good work! - I know, but... Look, most people would be terrified to walk down a runway in high heels. I, on the other hand, am terrified about walking down a runway in sneakers. I might trip in sneakers, but I am definitely not tripping in heels. ♪♪♪ [applause] ♪♪♪ - I'm not gonna not support tinsley. I know she loves these sort of disney-themed fashion shows. Maybe she'll find her yellow brick road, she'll have her wedding in cinderella's castle. With tinsley, it's believable. ♪♪♪ - wow! ♪♪♪ - the show is edgy, the clothes. It's not necessarily my kind of look, but ok, I can appreciate the spectacle. - It looks like she's naked. - Oh, no, I want you to wear that! [cheers and applause] - now, there it is! Amazing! [cheers and applause] ♪♪♪ [applause and cheering] - I was 19 or 20, like, when I first found out about tinsley, I read "vogue" all the time, she just was the "it girl." this is what tinsley was made to do. This is when she's at her best. She's finally back where she was in her heyday. Or almost back. - Go, tinsley! [cheers and applause] - show them, baby! - I see glimmers of the old tinsley on the runway because she was always very confident like that. Of recent, the last couple years, coming back to new york, she hasn't had that spark. It's back. - Whoo! - Oh, my god! - Turned it out! - And I was super on the score at the end. - Girl, get back on a runway! Look what happened! - Tinsley! - Tins! - Why did you walk down the aisle so fast? You looked so beautiful! - You owned the runway! - You bring an energy that's fresh! - Oh, I'm so proud of you! You were great! - You looked like a fairy godmother! - Thank you. - She's back! - Give me a tinsley pose. Gorgeous! - Coming up... - Sonja sent me pajamas to wear tonight. I was like... - What? - I was supposed to wear this. - Oh! ♪♪♪ - I feel like I need a hairstylist. Who's got a hot curling iron? ♪♪♪ my friends are late, so I might as well get my hair curled. It needed a little something-something. After the garo sparo show, I had to run home and change. I didn't have time to fix my hair, so guess what? I'm in a fashion show. I used to be a model. There are hairdressers all over the place, so why not? Thank god for you! - Come on, sonja, let's take some pictures. - Want to take pictures? - Yeah, will you take a couple pictures of us? - Yeah, sure. - Picture time - I want to take 'em with me, her, and sonja, ok, 'cause we're doing the show. - Can I take one before sonja comes? All right, let's take one. - Oh, no, that... ok, great. - All right. - Let's do the girls first, then we're gonna do john. - Girls first. - I'm not doing john. - [laughs] - thank you. Yes, I feel so much better now. Thank you, handsome. - Can I do one with the designer? Do you mind? - Oh, absolutely. - Excuse me for a second. Well, first, I'm doing it. I'm interrupting. That's who I am, an interrupter. Can you... can you take a picture of both of us, though, on my camera, so I can post it? I just want to post a picture from my night. Do you mind? - Oh, yeah. No, yeah. - Alone? Pictured alone? - Yeah, no. - I know, I want post, like a socialite, I'm sorry. I don't want to share her. - Nice! - Mwah! - That last show was pretty easy, right? - Wait, what's that? - I didn't sweat that last show at all, because it was like, I can't even wear those clothes. They're not... I'm not in that age group. ♪♪♪ - I... I like... - You could wear that. You've had all those fabulous wraps. You look so nice and tan. - Girls, we should... we should go in and sit down now. - Yeah, yeah. Yourhow! How cute would that be in your gift bag? - Does this work on sheets? 'cause tinsley stained my... my duvet cover. She covered the magazine. - With what? - Some kind of tomato sauce. Like, it's like she was in a dorm. She left her room full of like, like, empty cans, empty bottles. - Sh..., I'm gonna get in trouble. ♪♪♪ - "game of thrones." they threw torches all over my lawn. [overlapping chatter] - hi, tinsley. I want to say this now, 'cause you're better, but you really upset me, the way you left the room after I convinced you to clean it up. You really trashed it. I didn't have a housekeeper, and you left sodas all over, cans, water cans. - I cleaned up as much as I could. - Yeah, but unless I asked you. And then you didn't even mention to me that you stained my duvet cover. - I literally had a dot of spaghetti sauce, like this big, all on the bed. We're not talking like these are fortesse linens over here. I don't know. She bought them at bed bath & beyond. Ok, I got it. I'll buy you a whole new duvet cover. - When you leave a room, you clean it! - And I did, and I pulled off the sheets and whatever, but I very literally threw away... - Right now, though, like, I... I give up, all right? Can we talk about it later? Sorry. I'm going. - I got it out. I... I... Sit down! Sit down! Go sit, go sit! - Tinsley, where is, uh, leah? - She just texted me. She was like, she just couldn't make it right now. She was... probably like an issue with family or something. She said she was gonna come to the lunch. - Getting a placed seat in a great location at a fashion show is like the most coveted thing to have. No, not cool. Those glasses age you. You're so young and beautiful. Get different bifocals or different... - I'm... I'm working on my models for my fashion show. I don't care what I look like. - All right. Regarding models, I had asked marco to use one agency. Then you don't have to go one by one. Oh, we're short a few models? Like, how many models? Like, five models? Now I realize that my staff's not doing what I thought they were doing. - Here we go. ♪♪♪ - ok, is this better? - Oh, my god, so much better. ♪♪♪ sonja, I don't know what she's doing right now, 'cause this is totally embarrassing. Pamella roland is an icon. I got us all invited. We're in the front row, and she should know better. I mean, she's doing a fashion show. It takes weeks, months of preparation for a three-minute show. Can't you just put your phone away for three minutes? [phone buzzing] ♪♪♪ - I love pamella roland, and part of being in this industry is, we support each other, so physically I'm here, but mentally, I'm worried about my own darn show. Joe says he knows a model. ♪♪♪ pamella roland does it again. She knows a woman's body. - Ah... [cheers and applause] ♪♪♪ - I think sonja being at this pamella roland fashion show has made her realize and panic. She is not as organized for her fashion show. Someone go get sonja. Tell sonja we're going. - Come on, sonja. - Come on, sonja. - Let's go, we're late. - Oh, there she is. Perfect. - I have to go book my models. I can't do this. - Coming up... - This is a very coveted invitation. - She's a brat. - That's really rude. - What happened, though? - My dad called me and was like, your mother doesn't want to talk to you right now. ♪♪♪ a get on it. - Hi! We have a reservation under singer. We're six people. - Absolutely. We got you taken care of. - This is so nice. - I'll sit at the end, out of the sun, 'cause I'm very sensitive to the sun. - This is pretty out here. - I know, it, like, almost doesn't feel like new york in a way. - No. - You know? - It feels like boston almost. - This is a treat. I'm gonna get oysters. - Ok, you guys. I went to dinner with ramona. Honest to god, this is a true story. Ok, she got two dozen oysters. I said, "can I have one?" she goes, "well, could you just get your own?" - get your own? - I said, "it's disgusting. You're eating two dozen oysters!" - I love oysters. - You're gonna turn into a vagina. - That's a visual. Bawh! - Ramona eating an oyster, it is like watching a porn flick. The tongue, the quantities in a row and, by the way, she guards them like neptune's treasure. Oh, the food of the sea. [slurping] - sonja, are you gonna get off your phone anytime soon? You've been on your phone the whole time. - I've got this freaking fashion show. My fittings are tomorrow and they don't have the models. - Why weren't your fittings done last week? Why'd you wait so long? - Because, these are the people I hired. You know, I'm gonna go home. I have to go. I really have so much to do. - Sonja, that's ridiculous. - No, come on. - If you can't multitask, there's something wrong with your business. - Multitasking? This is a huge show! - No, it's not a huge show. - You could go around with your little glossy show, your one bottle of cream. - Oh, stop. - I have 20 models. I have 20 models. - So maybe a bigger mole, I don't know. - Just let me work! I'm standing here. Let me work. - What is that intern doing for you? - They can't do what I do! I have to negotiate the prices! - Just take a deep breath. - Nothing is free unless I get it! - All right, all right, all right. - I get the liquor sponsors, I get the... - You're good at that. - I get the models who are 14 and widely seen and... [overlapping arguing] - nothing! I just need to be able to do a couple of things right now so I can enjoy brunch. - Why don't you go and sit outside? Go sit over there for ten. - Thank you! - Yeah, take ten. Take ten. Take a breather. - Just let me do my thing. - All right. We're letting you do you. - Hi! - Oh, hey! - Oh, how are you? - Wait. Can I sit here? - Sure. - Yeah. - Well, we've got an extra seat because sonja's over there doing business. - Oh! So, what happened? - You know, I just... I needed a moment. - What kind of moment? - I needed a moment where I had to, uh, have a mental, not breakdown but breakthrough. - All right, but don't you think you could have contacted us? 'cause this is a very coveted invitation for friends. - I'm sorry. - And, you know, I've known you ten years. That's really rude. - Honestly, listen, I'm telling you, I promise that if I could have made it... - Bad news. We're front row, so pamella's like, "what happened?" - well, you two girls are really misbehaving. - It happened. What happened, though? - My dad called me and was like, "your mother, um..." he just said, "doesn't want to talk to you right now." - did something happen that makes her not want to talk to you? - You know, listen, when you... when you've had a nine-year period of not drinking and then decide to start doing it, obviously, rightly so, my mom is gonna be worried. - Well, why'd you tell her? - And that's what my dad's asking me, actually. - Right. - My mom, I told her that I did end up drinking. Not the end of the world. [screaming] she wasn't responding to my text messages after I told her, so when I called my dad after garo sparo, I told him, "I'm trying to get in touch with mom, I can't get in touch with her," and he's like, "you know, mommy's, like, really mad at you, and she just doesn't want to talk to you right now." - she's afraid of you going to that deep, dark place. - I... I would never go to that deep, dark place. - Well, she doesn't know that. She saw that and that's why she's freaking out. - Well, it's more about, how are you feeling about it? - I feel like I don't have any regrets. I feel like I was in a safe, good environment. I don't feel like I put myself in any danger. Um, yeah, I had a hangover the next day. That part sucks. And I'm not really used to those. Um, she's just... - Overreacting to it. - But not talking to you is really not helpful. - It's not helpful. For my mom, when she hears I'm drinking again, it's just like a trigger for her. I definitely think that my mom still views me as that wild teenager. It's very hard for her to accept me as a 37-year-old woman who's got her sh... together. She'll come around, you know? But... - But what did she say when you told her? You're the one who told her. - She didn't say anything. She didn't text. - Oh, you told her by text? Why'd you do it by text? You don't do things like that by text. - I'm a millennial. - She's a millennial. Everything is done by text. - Oh, my god! - Text messages are for just like, "what time will you be there?" and "I'm running late." not to tell your mother who had to put you in rehab when you were a teenager and didn't want you to come home after rehab, "oh, I'm drinking again, mom." [imitates buzzer] bad mistake. - But the thing is is I understand, like, I have this guilt pain too. Like, you guys don't know, like, I still try to, like, please my mom, so, like, I would also tell her things that maybe I shouldn't. It's like the worst thing, my mother... - Right, to be upset. - To be upset with me. - Yeah. - I ordered a dozen clams. No, no, oysters, oysters. - I don't really tell my mother anything, do you? - No. I don't tell my mother anything. - I don't tell her anything. - I keep her in the dark. She's not one to keep asking me that way. She likes it. Although I did have to call her when I got arrested, that's for sure. 'cause I knew she was gonna find out about that. - Oh, that's... Yeah. - My mother, she's just looking for the best for me, but she'll say things that she wants me to do, little things. - Like, give us an example. - Today... this is symbolic. - What'd she say? - And it might sound crazy to you guys, but my mother was very specific about not wanting me to have my hair curled today for the show. - What? - I know. She told me. - We had this big fight this morning about all this frizzy stuff I don't like, so... - She was very specific. - So controlling! - We got in, like, a whole argument about it, but not, like, in a bad way. More like, she was like, "you know, but you just look more beautiful with straight hair," and the whole thing, blah, blah, blah. - I wish me and my mother were arguing over, like, the way I wore my hair, but we're talking about, like, life... Big life sh... - I wanted to wear my hair a certain... - Sure. - Oh, definitely. At the same time, what do you also get for it? - No, I'm not doing it anymore. - I don't need everyone's advice always. I can also have an outsider to make my decision. - Make your own decision. - Right. - I might have to remove my brain with this knife. - [laughs] - we can agree to disagree, but I still have to move forward... - Hold it. - ...And be like, I'm ok with, like, making these decisions. [overlapping chatter] - I'm trying to show hard as a compassionate human to listen to the conversation of straight hair versus curly hair, but even the best people in the world... I don't even think mother teresa could tolerate this one. - Yes, thank you. - That's all good. Did you order...? - I ordered oysters. - For the table or just for you? - For me. - Ok. - I kept saying, "what do you girls want?" and you were busy talking. I'm starving. - I'm hungry. - I know, but it's rude to not order for the table. - I asked you. - Believe me, you've gotten our attention before very easily. - You ordered food and not for everybody? Could I get some bread? - I told you three times. You only listen to me when you want to listen to me. When you don't want to listen, you'll just listen to your own voice talk, which is fine. I get it. - That's not true. - Coming up... - If this is what you were supposed to look like, then... - You look like sh...! - Terrible! Terrible! - Terrible, terrible! Not for here! ♪♪♪ - yeah, I'm not worried about overcrowding the vip, because they're gonna bottle up on the step and repeat downstairs before they go upstairs for vip. Then we have to get them back downstairs for the show. ♪♪♪ - hi. - Hi. - Good to see you. - I'll let you know when jeff gets here in a few minutes. - Ok, perfect. Thanks. - Do you want anything? - No, I'm good. - Good. - Yeah. - Ok. - I started married to the mob when there was no streetwear for women. Actually, streetwear wasn't even really a term back when I started it. I really paved the way for many female brands that are out there now, and 15 years later, we're still doing it, which is a huge accomplishment. Hi! - I know you know jeff. - I didn't wash my hands 'cause they were too... - hi. - How are you? - Nice to see you. - Nice to see you too. All the clothing lines that I wanted to wear were men's, because all the girls' brands were just, too, like, cutesy and girlie, and I was like, all right, well, I'm not the only woman in the world that doesn't want to wear, like, cutesy, girly-type streetwear, so I was like, let me start my own brand. And also, I hate having a boss, and I kept getting fired from every job. - So we have 15 years, huh? - Yeah. - That's quite some time. It's... it's interesting because you've kind of put yourself in the middle of what was, uh, a man's world in many ways. - I know. - This thing that's called streetwear. - Yeah. I mean, I want to do my own thing from, like, a female kind of... - Right. - ...Perspective on everything. - Cool. - And that's why I started it. My type of feminism has always been like, I can do whatever the boys do and I can do it better than them. - Thank you so much. I know you've got more to do, so... - Yeah. I need to catch up with rob right now and fill him in on some stuff, so... - All right. - Bye. So good to see you. - Take care. All right, rob. - All right, jeff. - See you later, buddy. - Always a pleasure. - See ya. - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Good. - How was your day? - Busy. - Rob is my baby daddy/ex. It's really hard for people to understand me and rob's relationship, because it's so unique. - Perfect. - Perfect. - What's he doing? - He was like... - Yeah, I see him do that all the time. - I was just seeing who was coming in to the spot. - We're basically like an amazing married couple that doesn't live in the same house and doesn't have sex. What about kiki? Have you talked to kiki? - I did. I stopped home first. Your mother is watching her. - Did she say anything to you about me or...? - No, I didn't talk to her, really. She just walked in and I walked out. - Don't. Like, don't. Every... rob. You know everything's all good. - I... Disagreed when you said you were gonna have a drink. I didn't think that was a good idea. - Do you guys really think that I would do anything to put my life that I have worked so hard for in jeopardy? - I think it's a destructive path for you that we both... - I know, but I'm not using it destructively anymore. - It doesn't matter. Don't... whatever you say, you've warned yourself, so... - Rob and my mom, they're like my two rocks in my life, so to have both of them questioning me and my mother not even talking to me, it's really upsetting. - You know, that's your prerogative, what you do, but, like, when it starts affecting... - Oh, my god. - ...Our daughter, that's the only thing that I give a sh... about. - That's the only thing I give a sh... about too, rob. - So that's it. - Clearly. We're on the same page, me and you. - But, you know, your mother is really the only help that we have with our daughter. - I know. - That's why I'm like, you have to give her the respect that she deserves. - I honestly just can't believe that everything me and her have been through, we're still not in a place of understanding. There is still conflict with me and her. I still do not feel any kind of approval. I only feel judgment from her. - Well, that's what parents do. ♪♪♪ - ♪ hey hey hey ♪ ♪ get down on the floor now ♪ - ♪ move your body move your body ♪ ♪ move your body girl ♪ - what are you wearing, by the way? - Well, that's what I was gonna grab. - Oh, ok, good. - So I'm wearing... I think I'm gonna wear this one. I'm wearing sonja's design. - Of course you are. - I think I'm gonna wear this one. That's more me. Sonja was kind enough to send all the ladies options to wear to her show, and I was lucky enough to get a very cool, sort of liza minnelli-esque jacket. Yeah, her stuff is very fashionable. I can work with it. - How's john? - John's good, but you know, john never misses the opportunity to make... - To... it up? - ...To make a bad decision. - Oh, god, what has he done now? - He just doesn't... You know, he just doesn't think sometimes. - With you, or about work or life or what? - With... With me. I feel like john sometimes makes lifestyle choices that he knows I don't like. And he did it to me the other night. He wanted to go to this event that we were invited to, but I didn't want to go. Just too much, too many people, and he went. - On his own? - Yeah. What happened to you last night? You disappeared. - No. - Yeah, no, 'cause you gave... You know what he did? - No, honey, let's focus on the beautiful bride. - Like he's sneaking out to do it, even though he's like, he's like, "but I didn't. You said you didn't want to go, so I didn't..." but we're in a relationship for seven and a half years. It just... It... Kind of the answer is like, of course, I don't want to go either, right? That doesn't make me feel good. That doesn't give me the sense of well-being and love. What's out there that you're missing? Because clearly, if you're not home with me, you're not happy with me. Some people were there saying, "wait a second. We just saw john and didn't see you." I'm sort of at a point in my life where it's weird that people know where my boyfriend of seven and a half years... I'm being told, you know what I'm saying? - That's the bit where I find it actually kind of... - And it's not jealousy. It's not anything... - It just feels a bit disrespectful that... - Yes. - I am completely transparent as a person, and I don't hide secrets. It's not that I'm worried about him going out because he's doing something naughty. It's the non-transparency which runs deeper with me. But that's why sometimes I think the relationship gets stunted. It's like, "fine, go off and do it on your own, then." it's like I haven't returned phone calls for two days. - Oh, you haven't. - No. ♪♪♪ - all right, we're off. Go ahead, j. Oh, yeah! Oh, there's another stop over here. Oh, that's my old one! That's the one we roll up and put in the basement. Look at this one, guys, for the sangria. All right, let's do a selfie over here. - Here we go. - Oh, I love it. Team sonja. Oh, I look scary. That's right. You know what I look like? Phyllis diller. Remember her? You know phyllis diller, with the hair? All right, so let's get to work. All right, you want to put down the celebrity names, so you go ahead and do that. - [laughs] - what? Eucalyptus? All right, let me see what I can do. Hold on. This... this is really... I cannot deal with static all over the flowers. Fashion people are coming. We need beautiful, gorgeous flowers. Even stems would be better. It would be artistic. It would be a statement. This is an embarrassment. Can we put all the whites together and all the pinks together? - Sure. Let's... let's... let's... Let's... let's get it done. [musical ringtone] - hi, lu! - Hi! - Where are you? Somewhere tropical? - No... - You're not here for my fashion show? - No! - It's fashion week! - I know! - Nobody leaves new york during fashion week. - I know, but I have a show out in california. It's been booked for months and months and months. - We got a flower disaster here right now. Look. - Oh, god. - The same ones I buy for my apartment from home depot. Who's doing the flowers? I don't see any action over there. I gotta go, lu. You know, I'm about to go on stage. I can't do this, lu! You know how it is, okay? Not now. Bye, love you. Who's doing the flowers? - That guy and, uh... - What's "that guy"? - I don't know where he is. - Everybody better pull their heads out of their asses and figure out what's going on. Would you put the papers down? Put 'em all down! I'm looking for names! I'm looking for names! - Wow! - People are coming now, and I'm not even dressed! What are you holding these for? Over there! - Can I give you a look? Can I give you a look? - Yeah, yeah. This is beaut... oh! - Beautiful, right? Oh, don't worry about that. - This is so... I don't want you to think or ask anything. Put 'em all down! - Coming up... - Here's part of the look too! The sunglasses. Where's the crack pipe? Because who would be wearing this except someone that's high on crack? ♪♪♪ - hi! - Hi, sexy! - Hi, baby! I know I'm in, like, a little skintight little... - I know. I like it. - ...Sequined number. Hi. - Mwah! - You look pretty. - Thank you. - I see you didn't wear sonja by sonja morgan. - Well, you know, I didn't really... - you're gonna get in trouble! - I took the time to go on her website and I texted her three different dresses and said, "oh, wow, I really love your dresses." - yeah. - "I love these styles." - yeah. - "send me... send me, you know, something that looks like this." oh, thanks, sonja. Ok, this is not a... - Not a style with all the... Is that...? That's not... - I'm not sure it is. And this, I wouldn't call... This is not ath-leisure either. She's got no idea what she's talking about. She wants me... look at the dress you are wearing, okay? And look at... imagine if I showed up in a... ing... - This is the only option. - That's all she sent me. - She did send me two dresses. I mean... - She's passive-aggressive. - I... - I hate passive-aggressive people. I can't stand that. - No, no! And I... - I'd rather you be a... to my face. I'm pretty sure sonja's trying to send me some type of message. - 1985 is gone! It's over! J.P. Morgan! - Give me another one. I'll... him. - Maybe this is like, you know, me waking up with a horse head in the bed. - Oh, was this a part of the look too? - Oh, and here's... Here's part of the look too! The sunglasses... And where's the crack pipe? Because who would be wearing this except someone that's high on crack? I don't know. That's it. - I don't necessarily think that sonja is cool enough to actually have gotten that she was trying to purposely make leah feel stupid. I think that she maybe thought that leah would look cool. Are you bringing this is? - Yeah, I'm gonna bring this in. I'm gonna be the girl who... - Can I not? Can I, like, walk by? - No, bitch. You're walking in with me. - Like, I don't do this. - Yeah. - I know her. - I'm holding this proudly. - No, I... yeah, no. ♪♪♪ - at least tell me what to do. - Where are you going? - Front row, together. - So where am I supposed to be going? - I just don't really get what sonja's doing, because she's selling finished products, and it's not a line. She doesn't have a designer. It's just merchandise that's already made. So I... I... I don't know. Whatever sonja wants, it's fine by me. I support her. - I want a vodka with a splash of any juice. Like an orange juice or cranberry juice. Any juice that you have. No. Ok. - Oh, do it with the sangria. - Oh, I could. Yeah, well, yeah. - Oh, that's good. - So vodka with a splash of sangria. - Who is it? Why is he here? - 'cause he rsvped. - He's a photographer. He goes at the end of the runway. They say, "don't let 'em see you sweat." right now, I don't care what they see me do. I don't care what I look like, what I'm wearing. I need to make sure my guests are taken care of because they come first. That's why we're having the show to say thank you to supporters and to get what? Good press. Not bad press. - So can I start over? - Is that...? I'm gonna start the new glass. - Here. No, no, no. Me too. - So, yeah, straight ice, the vodka. And then put a splash of this in it. - Yeah. I want this, I think. - I don't know. I'm making my own concoction. I'm a mixologist now. - Oh, hello! - Give me a kiss. Hi, baby. How are you? - Hi, john. How are you? Good to see you. - Good to see you. - I didn't even know john was coming tonight. If I don't go to a party, I don't see john. It's weird to me. It's a disconnect I just can't seem to get my head around. - Thank you. It's sonja by sonja morgan. - She did all of it? - No, just the jacket. - It's cool. - And he doesn't even seem to acknowledge it. [laughter] - oh, this is excellent. I love it. - [laughs] - vodka with sangria by sonja. ♪♪♪ [laughter] - just a little sonja morgan dress. Super short. Usually don't wear underwear, but I am wearing underwear for the event. ♪♪♪ - hi. - Hello, hi, hi, how are you? - This is sonja by sonja morgan. - So, what is...? So is this. - I'm saying this is. Yeah, yeah, this is. Yes. - It looks nice on you. - Yeah. It's good, right? It looks good. It's good. - It's good they all... they all fit. - Well... - Well, not everything. - Oh, hey, are you in sonja by sonja? - No. - I'm not in the whole... - Oh. I didn't... I was like, when did she do this? - Yeah. - Yeah, that kind of... Yeah. Hers didn't really fit that well. 'cause lil' kim is my favorite. She's like my icon, my fave feminism icon. - I love this. - Thank you. - I actually had a skirt once with general mao on it, so I get the whole lil' kim thing. It was very fashionable back in the '90s, so I kind of get the vibe here. A little sort of a gangstery sort of thing going on. - Hello there. - [gasps] - second time. - Nice to see you. - Hi! - Hi! - Hey, gorg! - How are you? - Oh, my god, you look beautiful. - Oh, thanks. - Hi. - Oh, so do you! - Thank you. - No, I couldn't fit into it. - Oh! - I couldn't zip it up. It was just gorgeous. I'll show you. - But yeah, you're wearing a sonja dress? - Are you wearing a sonja? - No, sonja sent me pajamas to wear tonight. I was supposed to wear this. - Oh! It's not even... It's not even pretty colors. It's like a cop thing. If I was leah going to a fashion show with bunches of people, I wouldn't wear that outfit either. That's like a sweat outfit, something you do to like, I don't know, sleep in, uh, walk the dog. I know sonja thinks leah's a bit casual, but this is going over the top. I mean, what are you thinking, sonja? - And what did you do to deserve that? - [laughs] - she sent me... ♪♪♪ - I mean, she could have done silk pajamas. - I'm not gonna wear pajamas. - I made it into a jacket. - This is an attack on me. - Did you say anything to her? - Not yet. ♪♪♪ - coming up... - You know, I told her to explain it to her. - Seriously. - I gave you a nice bag! - It was ripped open! Are you kidding me? ♪♪♪ - I mean, she could have done silk pajamas. - I'm not gonna wear pajamas. - I made it into a jacket. - This is an attack on me. - Did you say anything to her? - Not yet. - Come on, sonja. Sonja, you knew what you were doing. But leah wasn't clever about it. I would have cut that sh... up, midrifted it, put on some great heels, and I would have gotten up and walked right on the runway. - Everybody sitting down! I need everyone sitting down. - Ok, I have to go to the bathroom now. No! ♪♪♪ - so, here we go. - Ok. - Here we go. - It's started. ♪♪♪ - it's cute. I just wish we knew that it started. There's no music. There's no lights. I was... there's just some girls walking by. I mean, is this the fashion show? - Oh, that's not a purse. - It looks like a diaper. But I love the pants and the blazer. They're very pretty. - It's cute. - Cute. - Oh, she could have given this to her, to leah. - Leah, you could have worn that. - Everything that's going down, it's just like, I would have worn that. - See, this is where they're gonna go, they're gonna go "ah," "ah." - now I can take a breath. The models look fantastic. The clothes are beautiful and they fit so well. This is sonja by sonja morgan. It's a really great moment for me. - Leah, you could have wore that, leah. Right? ♪♪♪ [cheers and applause] - yeah! Oh, I love that one. - I think this show will continue conversations with several retailers that have been following me for a while. Century 21 came. It all comes together in life when it's supposed to. - Hi! Thank you! I love my dress! - You rock! - Yay! - You rock! - I'm in the fashion industry. I've been going to fashion week events since I was literally in eighth grade, when I was babysitting for the editor of "seventeen" magazine, and I know what a fashion show looks like. This is not a fashion show. - I was very impressed. - The sexy... - Now the only question I have is, do I have to return the jacket? - You're not allowed to keep it. - No, that's yours. Did you like your dress? - I loved it! I couldn't zipper it up! Oh, hi! - Hi! - Oh, I saw that in some article. Who is that? Beyonce or somebody? Who is that? - That's, uh, what's her name. - I wanted to wear... - What happened to the cashmere two-piece satin? That's my signature... It was in "elle." - there's a lot of dresses in your collection that would have looked great on her. - I honestly feel like you're like, you know what? You're like, "you're the downtown one.", "you're the tattooed one." I think you're full of sh... and I think you're passive-aggressive, and I think you're still mad at me from the hamptons. [overlapping arguing] - I can't believe leah is doing this with me right here now, my moment. Does she really think I have the time to do something so passive-aggressive with her? Like, I want to do you in and dress you bad. ♪♪♪ - you know, I told her to explain it. - Here. Seriously. - I gave you a nice bag! - This is bullsh...! - I gave you a beautiful bag! A beautiful bag! - The bag was torn! It was ripped open! Are you kidding me? I mean, a brown paper bag that was ripped open. - Where are all the sunglasses? - Everybody gets to wear a dress but me. I know. I don't get to wear a dress. Only sonja gets to wear a dress. - But sonja, would you really want to wear that tonight? - Yes! - She wanted me to wear it. - Oh, no. No, no, no! - No, no, no! - I didn't think leah would want to wear one of my frilly dresses. What would I think she would want to wear? I never saw her in a frilly dress, ever! And my dresses are kind of fancy. - I'm sorry, they don't even fit right. I tried it on. I looked crazy. - Like, we all needed dresses. - There's that and that. - That one would have looked great on her. - Oh, my god. Amazing. - I mean, I didn't know there would be, like... - I was trying to be supportive. - That doesn't look, like, expensive, but... - So that's why... - Lookit. Hey, it's leah. Here's my size. - And... And if this is what you were supposed to look like, then... - You look like sh...! - Terrible! - You look like a... - Terrible, terrible! - Terrible, terrible! - Terrible! - Not for here. - Sorry, sonja. - No, no, no! - Look, I can't even be mad at her! How can I be mad at her? I still think what sonja did was shady and passive-aggressive, but it's pretty damn hard to stay mad at sonja when she's prancing around her fashion show, looking like a pimp in pajamas. - It's good for tonight when you get home, lounging. - Yo, all right! Exactly, sonja! - It's sleepwear! - I'm gonna wear it now when I go home to eat a cheeseburger in bed. - Next time on "the real housewives of new york city"... - Who's going to luann's? - I'm going. - Is she not drinking? - I guess she goes day by day. - So, but she's not committed to long-term? - Your glass of red wine, if you can manage to have one. - Not two, huh? [laughs] - one. - I never... ed a pirate, so please welcome to the stage... [cheers and applause] - watch out! - Oh, sh...! - They're saying she's intimidated by this. - Seriously? - Am I scary? - Not really. - Ah! - No, honey. It's all vodka. ♪♪♪
