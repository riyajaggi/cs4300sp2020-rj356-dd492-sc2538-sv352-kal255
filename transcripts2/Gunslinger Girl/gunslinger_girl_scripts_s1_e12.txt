 {\an2}What should I do? What if Giuse-san is mad? {\an2}I hear you put on a big act in Sicily. {\an2}Maybe I overdid it a little? {\an2}Did you make sure? {\an2}If I could, I wouldn't be worried... {\an2}But he seemed normal to me... {\an2}Really? {\an2}Yeah. {\an2}That's good! {\an2}Henrietta, Triela, enter. {\an2}SYMBIOSIS

 {\an2}Good work, Henrietta. {\an2}Keep it up. {\an2}Okay! {\an2}-See! -Yeah! {\an2}Next up, Angelica and Rico, enter. {\an2}Yes, sir! {\an2}Angelica! {\an2}Are you alright? {\an2}We have a problem. {\an2}Stop the exercise. {\an2}Are you all right? {\an2}I can walk by myself. {\an2}I'm sorry, Marco-san. I'm fine now. {\an2}Not walking like that, you're not.

 {\an2}Have Ferro take you to the hospital. {\an2}Yes, sir... {\an2}Maybe it was too soon; she did just get out of the hospital. {\an2}You should be more perceptive of her condition. {\an2}She asked to participate in the exercise. {\an2}-Back to the training. -Yes, sir. {\an2}First Elsa's incident, then Angelica's bad condition-- {\an2}you seem to have many setbacks. {\an2}They're within calculated limits. {\an2}Trial runs are just one step-- they still hold much promise. {\an2}Why don't you tell us what you really think? {\an2}Perhaps Section 2 has its limits, {\an2}which are now becoming apparent? {\an2}I beg to differ. {\an2}On the whole, its duties are being handled smoothly. {\an2}Let's give them some more time. {\an2}Lorenzo, how is it? {\an2}It's not going as we planned. {\an2}After all, these are human beings. {\an2}You'll need real results soon, I can't cover for you forever. {\an2}Yes. I know. {\an2}According to radical elements within the R.F., {\an2}they plan to abduct the daughter of a powerful senator. {\an2}Are you certain of this? {\an2}The information came from their accountant, Filippo Adani. {\an2}It's fact. {\an2}Fortunately, the target, Caterina Sanctis, is close in age {\an2}to Section 2's girls. {\an2}We'll let a cyborg be kidnapped, locate the terrorists' hideout, {\an2}and then take it down. {\an2}A cyborg decoy? Isn't that risky? {\an2}Yeah, I don't know about this... {\an2}Section 2's very existence is in jeopardy! {\an2}But... {\an2}Section 2 has been receiving a lot of criticism. {\an2}We'll have to take some risks. {\an2}We'll use Claes as the decoy. {\an2}They say the next job will be a big one. {\an2}Yeah. Hirscher-san said it's going to be dangerous. {\an2}Say, Claes, aren't you scared to be a decoy? {\an2}Not really. {\an2}The grain of wheat thing? {\an2}No, I'm just following orders. {\an2}What about wheat? {\an2}If a fallen wheat grain survives, it stays the same. {\an2}But if it dies, a lot grows from it. {\an2}It means that nothing will happen without someone's sacrifice. {\an2}Marco-san. {\an2}Let me help with the operation, too! {\an2}This isn't training. Failure isn't an option. {\an2}I'll try my very best! Please! {\an2}I'll think it over. {\an2}Yes, sir... {\an2}Jean, the car is heading toward central Rome. {\an2}Understood. {\an2}Let's go. {\an2}Yeah. {\an2}The transmitter's working. {\an2}The car is heading north from downtown Rome. {\an2}Any problems preparing to follow them? {\an2}We've placed Section 2 members at key points in the vicinity. {\an2}We placed a tracking device in one of Claes' teeth, {\an2}but we lost the signal when they entered some mountains. {\an2}The senator received the first call at home. {\an2}They want to trade for some incarcerated terrorists. {\an2}So they still don't know who Claes really is... {\an2}If they do realize she's a fake... {\an2}Claes has almost no combat experience. {\an2}She couldn't hurt anyone as she is. {\an2}That worries me... {\an2}Chief? {\an2}I have a good friend in the military police. {\an2}I'll need backup. {\an2}Nice doing business with you. {\an2}May I talk with her for a moment? {\an2}If it's just for a moment. {\an2}Studying in a place like this? {\an2}No, it's a picture book about plants. {\an2}I used to love picture books! {\an2}Vegetation in the north is different than in the south, right? {\an2}Yes. Conifers are more common at higher latitudes. {\an2}You're not worried? {\an2}I'm fine. Reading somehow makes me calm. {\an2}I think I've always liked books since I was little. {\an2}Besides... I'm not a grain of wheat. {\an2}I see. Well, bye. {\an2}Goodbye. {\an2}They're letting the hostage see their faces. {\an2}Yes. They must not plan to return her alive. {\an2}What a bunch of fools. {\an2}I hope that girl teaches them a lesson... {\an2}That grain of wheat... {\an2}What? {\an2}Nothing. Let's get out of here. {\an2}Chief Lorenzo! {\an2}The police received an anonymous call. {\an2}What? {\an2}They're at a northern villa. At least 20 terrorists. {\an2}There's even info about the villa's layout... {\an2}Can we trust this information? {\an2}The terrorists could've leaked it to throw the police off. {\an2}Supposedly, the caller was a young woman. {\an2}A woman? {\an2}There's no way to find out more. {\an2}Our only option is to survey the area, but that'd take time. {\an2}This operation will end in failure if we take too long. {\an2}I recognize the risk. Let's crush them! {\an2}We'll approach from the mountains behind the villa. {\an2}After touchdown, Giuse, Henrietta, Jean, and Rico {\an2}will enter from the front as a feint, {\an2}and we'll enter from the terrace area. {\an2}We only have one shot at this. {\an2}Stop. {\an2}Good luck... {\an2}Alright. Understood. {\an2}The army's analysis team has located Claes. {\an2}Looks like things worked out fine. {\an2}But the real show has yet to begin. {\an2}We must destroy the terrorists on our own. {\an2}Ange, it's okay. Just calm down. {\an2}Get up here! {\an2}We're in position. How about you? {\an2}We've just landed on the roof. {\an2}Good. We'll charge inside in exactly three minutes. {\an2}Synchronize your watch. {\an2}Five, four, three, two, one... set. {\an2}-Rico, you cover us. -Yes, sir. {\an2}Here we go, Henrietta. {\an2}Right. {\an2}-What the... Is it the cops?! -No. {\an2}All the guards are dead! We're being raided! {\an2}Angelica?! {\an2}Ange! Come back! {\an2}What's wrong, Triela?! {\an2}Ange ran off by herself! {\an2}Don't move. {\an2}You're dead no matter what you do. {\an2}Ange?! {\an2}Claes! Are you ok?! {\an2}Ange's been hurt! {\an2}Angelica! {\an2}Marco-san... {\an2}What the hell were you thinking? {\an2}I told you not to drag everyone down! {\an2}Marco! That's enough! {\an2}Angelica, are you alright? {\an2}Yes. {\an2}I'm glad you seem well! {\an2}I hope you get better and come back to the dorms soon! {\an2}You know the truth. {\an2}We're all going to die! {\an2}We're going to die not knowing anything! {\an2}If Marco-san is going to keep treating me coldly, {\an2}then I'd rather die now! {\an2}If you want to die, then die! {\an2}I shouldn't have saved you! {\an2}Claes! {\an2}I couldn't see behind Claes' glasses well enough {\an2}to tell if she was angry or crying... {\an2}But Angelica's words, "We're all going to die," {\an2}never stopped ringing in her ears. {\an2}FALLING STAR
