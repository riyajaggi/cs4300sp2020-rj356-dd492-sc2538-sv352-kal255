 {\an2}Henrietta... {\an2}Can I see too? {\an2}It leaves in five minutes. Come on. {\an2}We'll arrive at Sicily Island in the morning. {\an2}Um, Giuse-san? {\an2}Yes? {\an2}Why did you suddenly invite me on a trip? {\an2}You haven't had a break in a while. {\an2}Everyone needs the occasional change of pace. {\an2}This is the first time I've ever taken a sudden vacation. {\an2}The chief probably felt it was in our best interest.

 {\an2}This is horrible, Inspector. {\an2}They were most likely murdered late at night. {\an2}Their wallet and purse are untouched... {\an2}The victims are a trading company man and his daughter from Rome. {\an2}Do you suppose the killers dropped this gun? {\an2}You don't see German-made automatic handguns every day. {\an2}Inspector Baracchi. {\an2}What is it? {\an2}People from the Italian Intelligence Office are here. {\an2}Intelligence Office? {\an2}This must be one thorny case... {\an2}Are you in charge here? {\an2}I'm Baracchi of the city police. {\an2}What suddenly brings the Intelligence Office here? {\an2}As this incident may be connected to another case, {\an2}we've been placed in charge. {\an2}All the necessary documents are right here. {\an2}It's all yours. {\an2}Inspector, doesn't it seem strange {\an2}for the Intelligence Office to suddenly show up? {\an2}Don't worry about it. {\an2}They actually want to take care of all the hassle. {\an2}Yet, something does seem odd... {\an2}They're too organized to be from the Intelligence Office, {\an2}and too eager about their work. {\an2}Let sleeping dogs lie. {\an2}Is she one of ours? {\an2}It's definitely Elsa. {\an2}I see. {\an2}They both had their brains blown out. {\an2}Who did it? Was this fratello on assignment? {\an2}The log said they went out for personal reasons. {\an2}We can't determine who's responsible at this time. {\an2}If they were attacked because they were from the agency, {\an2}then it could've been the R.F. or the southern Mafia. {\an2}Or another government agency. {\an2}Find the killers at once. {\an2}Yes, sir. {\an2}What about the media? {\an2}Ferro's taken care of it. This incident won't be reported. {\an2}Once you've finished your report, remove the bodies. {\an2}I'm going back to report to the director. {\an2}Understood. {\an2}You asked for me? {\an2}Have you heard about this morning's incident? {\an2}I heard that a puppet from Section 2 was attacked or something... {\an2}One member was also killed. {\an2}They still haven't found who did it. {\an2}That's what they get for playing house. {\an2}I want you to investigate this incident. {\an2}This is a good chance to put pressure on Section 2. {\an2}Section 1 is going to conduct its own investigation. {\an2}But what exactly should I do? {\an2}The issue is if cyborgs have any real use in the future or not. {\an2}If we can determine that they're useless, I can advise the higher-ups. {\an2}If possible, I'd like all of Section 2 gone. {\an2}I see... {\an2}While you're investigating, go see what these cyborgs are like. {\an2}Yes. Yes, sir. {\an2}Yes. Alright. {\an2}Section 1 wants to investigate? {\an2}Yes, I understand. I'll assist. {\an2}Of course. {\an2}Looks like they're here. {\an2}Pietro Fermi and Elenora Gabrielli from Section 1. {\an2}Good to meet you. I've been informed. {\an2}Who's she? {\an2}Rico, my cyborg. {\an2}Rico? But she's a girl... {\an2}Each cyborg is named by her Handler. {\an2}We're free to give them boys' names too. {\an2}-What's her last name? -She doesn't have one. {\an2}Has Section 2 come up with any suspects? {\an2}It's currently under investigation, but killing people is our job. {\an2}We have enemies everywhere. {\an2}Do you really need to use cyborgs, though? {\an2}They can kill with guns or even dictionaries if necessary. {\an2}They would hit someone with a dictionary if ordered to. {\an2}Wasn't Section 2 known for having a sturdy dictionary? {\an2}Yes, but the cyborgs are fussy and their eyes are their weak spots. {\an2}If their brains are hit, they will die. {\an2}But that sort of thing is rare. {\an2}Everyone who's ever attacked a fratello has died. {\an2}Fratello? Ah, like brother and sister. {\an2}So, these girls attack based on their own judgment? {\an2}Strong as they are, these puppets can still be shot in the eye, right? {\an2}Each Handler is free to train his cyborg as he sees fit, {\an2}but they're all given conditioning to ensure they'll do their jobs. {\an2}Particularly, they're made to sensitively react to any harm to their masters. {\an2}I see. {\an2}So they're not just puppets... {\an2}Did anything out of the ordinary happen during their recent jobs? {\an2}There are no such reports. {\an2}I see. Then how was their teamwork? {\an2}No real problems. {\an2}Rico, put the gun away. {\an2}Fermi, it's nice to be curious, {\an2}but you'd be dead now if you weren't with the agency. {\an2}So now you know more about the cyborgs. {\an2}But Elsa died without protecting her master. {\an2}Elsa fired two rounds back. Where are the bullets? {\an2}We're searching the entire area. {\an2}If they hit the killers, there may be blood stains. {\an2}So then Triela got another teddy bear, making nine total. {\an2}She was up until morning deciding its name! {\an2}Do you want teddy bears too? {\an2}No. Your praise is more than enough for me. {\an2}No, you should be greedier. {\an2}You really have worked hard. {\an2}Here's your reward. {\an2}Can I open it? {\an2}Go ahead. {\an2}You certainly are gentle. {\an2}I'm going to iron the wrapping paper and keep it. {\an2}A camera! {\an2}Now you can keep lots of daily records and happy memories. {\an2}I'll take good care of it! {\an2}I'll hold on to your gun for today. {\an2}Show them around the Cyborg Ward. {\an2}Is the Cyborg Ward like a dormitory? {\an2}Yes. {\an2}Rico, I've been wondering... {\an2}Yes? {\an2}Aren't you sad that Elsa was murdered? {\an2}It doesn't matter to me. She wasn't my friend. {\an2}But she was one of you! {\an2}It doesn't matter. {\an2}This is Elsa's room. {\an2}There's nothing in here... {\an2}Most of us share rooms, but Elsa lived by herself. {\an2}Are all your rooms this dreary? {\an2}Henrietta and Triela add lots of stuff. {\an2}I think their Handlers give them things... {\an2}...but I'm not really sure. {\an2}Did anyone else know her? {\an2}Triela's in her room right now. {\an2}Triela... {\an2}Rico, is your job done already? {\an2}Can we come in? {\an2}Who might you be? {\an2}Books and stuffed animals. It's almost like my niece's room. {\an2}This is Fermi-san and Gabrielli-san from Section 1. {\an2}They want to ask about Elsa. {\an2}Claes? {\an2}I leave it up to you. {\an2}What was Elsa like? {\an2}She was totally in love with Lauro. {\an2}Most of the girls here are like that. {\an2}Including you? {\an2}Don't be silly. {\an2}Though there is some affection for him. {\an2}Conditioning? {\an2}Conditioning and love are similar. {\an2}Not even I know how far my own feelings go. {\an2}So feelings of love sometime sprout from loyalty? {\an2}That's how Elsa was. {\an2}How do you feel about Elsa's death? {\an2}She was a loner... {\an2}And from the way she acted, {\an2}she was probably happy to die for Lauro... {\an2}I see. {\an2}Thank you. I'm glad we could talk. {\an2}Next time you come, at least bring some flowers. {\an2}How was the Section 1 investigator? {\an2}He was quite a capable man. {\an2}I see. {\an2}Here's the report on the bullets that killed Lauro and Elsa. {\an2}This is bad. {\an2}If true, it's a serious matter. {\an2}Yes, Section 1's Draghi won't keep it quiet. {\an2}He may pose a problem to our cybernetic testing. {\an2}Can't we do something? {\an2}If we hide the ballistics info and blame it on a malfunction, {\an2}they may stop pressuring us. {\an2}That would be acceptable-- it was our mistake. {\an2}Elsa De Sica fought and died for her master. {\an2}Yes. {\an2}And give Giuse some time off. {\an2}I want him away from here until this Elsa business cools down. {\an2}You're as easy on him as ever. {\an2}Guys like him need to be protected by those around them. {\an2}He's too innocent, so the truth could really hurt him. {\an2}Giuse. {\an2}Jean... {\an2}Are cyborgs that easily brought down? {\an2}Accident or no accident, Elsa was shot through the eye. {\an2}Lauro was also shot once in the head. {\an2}They were good at their job. {\an2}Yeah. {\an2}The Republican Faction was responsible? {\an2}Without a doubt. {\an2}Blood stains from two known terrorists were found in the park. {\an2}They're known for attacking people associated with public safety. {\an2}So the cyborgs are still incomplete... {\an2}My boss will probably be satisfied with this. {\an2}It's unknown where they got the information, {\an2}but the terrorists ambushed them in the park that night. {\an2}Elsa died protecting Lauro. {\an2}I assume we'll improve their eyes next. {\an2}Happy to die for her master... {\an2}Tell me, Rico. {\an2}Would you be happy to die protecting Jean-san? {\an2}I don't really want to die. But... {\an2}The cyborgs are there for the Handlers. {\an2}It's only natural for them to die in their place. {\an2}Rico? {\an2}If Jean-san says so, then he must be right. {\an2}What? Sicily? Why'd they go there?! {\an2}How should I know? {\an2}They suddenly left on vacation after getting back. {\an2}Oh, and just so you know, this phone might be bugged. {\an2}We're not doing anything bad. {\an2}Thanks. {\an2}Fermi-san, did you finish your report to the boss? {\an2}Yeah... {\an2}Did he consent? {\an2}Yeah. But we have a little more to check. {\an2}Let's go. {\an2}Henrietta. {\an2}Giuse-san... {\an2}Good morning. {\an2}Good morning. {\an2}Take a look outside. {\an2}It's beautiful! {\an2}It's Sicily Island. {\an2}HIGH FEVER
