 {\an2}ICE CREAM {\an2}A toy? {\an2}I wouldn't call it that. {\an2}They've been known to explode and kill people. {\an2}But this one's too weak. It's not like them. {\an2}The timer and everything else seem amateur-like. {\an2}I'd be surprised if it even detonates. {\an2}So you're saying this was a diversion? {\an2}-This wasn't the real objective? -Nope. {\an2}And the planned assault on the national museum? {\an2}We've come across bits and pieces of intelligence.

 {\an2}It's fleeting information like that that tickles the analysts' instincts. {\an2}The militant factionists are just raring to go. {\an2}I see. But your people don't believe that. {\an2}What got me riled up was the amateur subway bomb. {\an2}It's just too much. {\an2}They're incapable of making their own bombs. {\an2}Their pathetic excuse for a bomb wasn't meant as a feint, {\an2}but to provoke the professionals' pride. {\an2}You'd make a good mystery writer. {\an2}No injuries were reported, and officials aren't even certain {\an2}-What do you think? -it was a terrorist group's bomb. {\an2}We knew from the start that they couldn't make bombs. {\an2}I mean about how they thought they could lure us out. {\an2}They sure underestimated us.

 {\an2}-They'll get no help from us. -Yeah. Why should we? {\an2}The man back there is Enrico Perdini. {\an2}He's an ultra-left terrorist in the Republican Faction, {\an2}and responsible for last year's bombing at Republic Square {\an2}and four other incidents. {\an2}I see. {\an2}Well, Henrietta? Hear anything? {\an2}Complicated politics. {\an2}He's criticizing the southern plant's development work. {\an2}"No more of the northern plant's tax funds {\an2}must go into the southern plant." {\an2}"If this plan succeeds, the government will rethink its ways." {\an2}Changing his stripes to get funds... {\an2}He was originally an anarchist. {\an2}He changed his thinking? {\an2}No, he'll work under any flag to get funds for his movement. {\an2}The R.F.'s Lombardian Plains Freedom Movement is supported {\an2}by northern capitalists who have followed the flow {\an2}of European right-turners and anti-globalism. {\an2}Much different than ultra-left terrorists who rob banks for funds. {\an2}Alright. Let's persuade them from the proper direction. {\an2}They've lost sight of the goal. {\an2}If we make them relearn the meaning of a just cause, {\an2}they'll have to... {\an2}Right. I'll get the committee moving. {\an2}I'll make sure it gets delivered by 2:00 tonight. {\an2}When that time comes, give them a lesson they'll never forget, Henrietta. {\an2}Enzo. {\an2}Is it okay for us to stop watching Enrico? {\an2}Don't worry, we have a team on him. {\an2}We'll capture him once they've met the bomb makers. {\an2}Until then, prepare for the assault at the branch office. {\an2}Incidentally, will one fratello really be enough? {\an2}I'd like to capture the bomb makers alive. {\an2}That will make things tougher. {\an2}I'll call HQ and try getting a few fratellos before tonight. {\an2}Thanks, Giuse. The Rome branch is short of hands right now. {\an2}All the macho guys have left for the museum. {\an2}What's Enrico's plan? {\an2}To blow something up, of course. {\an2}He'll go to any lengths to get what he wants. {\an2}What's wrong? {\an2}Don't look so disappointed. {\an2}Giuse doesn't think you're unreliable. {\an2}If you and the backup from HQ take care of things smoothly, {\an2}he'll give you a reward. {\an2}What's this? Perfume? {\an2}I suppose I buy her too much... {\an2}But the things I get her are sort of like her salary. {\an2}Well, kids are most adorable at around this age... {\an2}I can understand buying her stuff. {\an2}My own daughter's old enough to go partying at night. {\an2}She rarely comes by the house anymore. {\an2}Tommaso. {\an2}I've brought support from headquarters. {\an2}Alright. {\an2}This is where they print the government newspaper. {\an2}-It's no place for children. -It's alright, Pietro. {\an2}She's the one I mentioned. {\an2}I've been informed. Take her inside immediately. {\an2}Right. {\an2}Sorry. Getting outside help means you gotta take their attitude. {\an2}I'm used to it. {\an2}Well, just relax until evening. Do you need anything? {\an2}Yes, spare ammo for Henrietta, and an FN57. {\an2}Jean? Pattern B. {\an2}Right. {\an2}Yes? Right. {\an2}Understood. Bye. {\an2}Bad news. {\an2}He gave them the slip. {\an2}Yeah. How did you know? {\an2}Our people caught up with him. {\an2}They're on his trail now. {\an2}He got off the subway. {\an2}Which station? {\an2}Cavour, B Line. {\an2}Alright. I'll follow him. {\an2}Okay. {\an2}Wait, that's one stop before the museum. {\an2}What's his real target? {\an2}No idea... {\an2}At any rate, it won't matter after tonight. {\an2}I'll contact our guys there. {\an2}The backup... {\an2}The backup is already here, isn't it? {\an2}Yes. I called for Rico and Triela. {\an2}We've planned for multiple contingencies. {\an2}It'll be a while until we find where they're hiding. {\an2}Take a nap while you decide what you want for your reward. {\an2}Actually, I already know what I want. {\an2}He's not headed for the museum. {\an2}He's going in the opposite direction, walking around Rome. {\an2}What's his target?! {\an2}Enrico's back. {\an2}Understood. {\an2}Enrico, why are you still in Rome? {\an2}I'd much rather make the deal in Ostia. {\an2}Sorry, Franca. I wanted to scope out the location first. {\an2}Rome is in the lap of this so-called agency. {\an2}It's dangerous to stay here. {\an2}Some guys followed me this afternoon, but I shook 'em off. {\an2}They probably have their hands full right now {\an2}with the ruckus at the museum. {\an2}Anyway, I want to do it tomorrow. {\an2}Deliver it by the appointed time tonight. {\an2}The bomb arrangements are set. {\an2}Did we really need their help? {\an2}Yeah. {\an2}Franca and Franco's bombs are absolutely impossible to dismantle! {\an2}He's a lost cause. {\an2}There's no cure for a fool. {\an2}It's an order from above, so we'll help him. {\an2}I'd prefer to have people like him gone, though. {\an2}Where are they planting it? {\an2}That question gives me second thoughts about this. {\an2}Should we hand it over? {\an2}Good question. If they really are serious, {\an2}then maybe we should give 'em a fake. {\an2}I'll get ready to go. {\an2}It's time, but the bomb makers haven't shown up. {\an2}-Remain on standby. -Roger. {\an2}Are they really gonna show?! {\an2}They'll come. {\an2}Enrico-san. {\an2}Something's wrong. {\an2}There's no traffic beyond the bridge. {\an2}Maybe there was an accident? {\an2}It's too hard to tell from here. {\an2}Accident reported. {\an2}The national police has diverted traffic on this block {\an2}because of a three-car pileup. {\an2}Damn it! {\an2}Simone. {\an2}Yes? {\an2}The opposite bank seems odd. {\an2}I can hear police sirens. {\an2}Go check it out. {\an2}Understood. {\an2}Enzo. {\an2}It's started. {\an2}I don't care. They're not gonna show tonight. {\an2}Grill that Enrico bastard! {\an2}Camouflage for a public security raid? {\an2}Probably. {\an2}Cut the lights! Stay out of the windows! {\an2}Lights out on the 3rd floor of the southern building. {\an2}Enrico must be in there. Can you see him? {\an2}Not from this position. {\an2}Understood. {\an2}Hirscher, how about you? {\an2}I'm having Triela climb up from the west side. {\an2}Good. I'll send Henrietta in so we can surround him. {\an2}Please don't shoot! {\an2}Please help... {\an2}There were scary people downstairs with guns... {\an2}And then... {\an2}How'd this kid get inside? {\an2}Perfect timing. We can use her as a hostage. {\an2}Don't worry! Come here! {\an2}Hurry up! {\an2}Hurry up before the guys with guns come! {\an2}Now be a good little-- {\an2}Damn it! {\an2}Officers! {\an2}Did something happen on that holm? {\an2}There was an arrest last night. It's off-limits now. {\an2}So Spain Square had a narrow escape... {\an2}Are you sure a simple ice cream is all you want? {\an2}Especially during the middle of winter? {\an2}I'm sure. There's a meaning behind ice cream in Spain Square. {\an2}Oh, my. Are you okay? {\an2}I'm sorry... {\an2}I'm glad your ice cream is okay! {\an2}You are in Spain Square, after all! {\an2}Yes, ma'am! {\an2}What is it? {\an2}That girl had Pupa perfume on. {\an2}So? {\an2}Pupa perfume and an Amati violin... {\an2}She must be the daughter of a well-to-do family. {\an2}I sure am glad that Enrico idiot got arrested. {\an2}It's girls like her that we Republican Factionists are out to protect. {\an2}PROTECTION
