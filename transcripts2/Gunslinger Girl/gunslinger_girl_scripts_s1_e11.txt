 {\an2}Say, Elenora. {\an2}Can we take the car onto Sicily Island? {\an2}Let me check... {\an2}Yes. There's a ferry that leaves from Reggio di Calabria. {\an2}Your diligence lets me cut corners. {\an2}Incidentally, this is the road the ancient Romans used {\an2}to attack Greek cities in Sicily. {\an2}Hey now. Don't tell me you have my underwear color in there too. {\an2}HIGH FEVER {\an2}We'll be staying at a hotel by the port. {\an2}We'll come immediately if anything happens.

 {\an2}You worry too much, Ferro. {\an2}You heard what happened to Elsa. You need to be extra careful. {\an2}Henrietta. {\an2}Make sure nothing happens to Giuse-san. {\an2}Right. {\an2}This is a nice house. {\an2}It's off-season right now, {\an2}but I used to spend summers here with my family. {\an2}Your family? Including Jean-san? {\an2}Yes, him too. {\an2}Now I'm spending time with you. {\an2}Step out onto the terrace. {\an2}Let's come again when the season changes. {\an2}Sicily in the summer is the best.

 {\an2}You'll bring me back again? {\an2}As often as you like. {\an2}Henrietta. {\an2}Give me your case and the SIG on your belt. {\an2}Come on, now... {\an2}No! I absolutely need these to protect you! {\an2}We're here as a reporter on vacation and his niece. {\an2}A normal girl mustn't carry such things. {\an2}A normal girl... {\an2}That's right. {\an2}Gimme a break. {\an2}This is no place for work. {\an2}Nope! {\an2}"Living here day after day, you think it's the center of the world." {\an2}Why don't you quit and become a tour guide? {\an2}The cyborgs normally protect us, but now we protect them. {\an2}How ironic. {\an2}There's no time for idle talk. {\an2}We can't be careless for one moment. {\an2}Yeah, I know. {\an2}Aren't they from Section 2? {\an2}Why did we have to hide? {\an2}Best to avoid any trouble if possible. {\an2}I see... {\an2}Maybe they're not home? {\an2}Oh... {\an2}Hey, now, don't shoot. {\an2}We're from the Social Welfare Agency. {\an2}Pietro Fermi and Elenora Gabrielli from Section 1. {\an2}Triela told us about you. {\an2}Section 1, huh? {\an2}Hey there, reporter. {\an2}We're on vacation. What do you want? {\an2}I'm handling this incident for our section. {\an2}We came all this way. May we come in? {\an2}Sure. Come in. {\an2}Henrietta. {\an2}Oh, there are no weapons allowed in this house. {\an2}I'll take them for you. {\an2}We're on vacation. We don't want the smell of gun oil here. {\an2}You gonna take away my 'You-Know-What' next? {\an2}Leave your dirty mouth at the door as well. {\an2}Wasn't the Elsa case closed? {\an2}Yes. {\an2}Then all that's left is to wait for the terrorists to be caught. {\an2}Officially, yes... {\an2}But something just doesn't feel right. {\an2}Our boss doesn't know we're here. {\an2}Fermi-san, he didn't order us here? {\an2}I told him my grandma in Naples fell ill. {\an2}So it's half business, half personal. {\an2}Why did you follow us? {\an2}Triela said to see you to learn more about fratello relationships. {\an2}I see... {\an2}Henrietta, could you go make us some dinner? {\an2}Okay. {\an2}She does housework too? {\an2}Yes. She seems to practice in her dorm room, {\an2}but I wouldn't expect anything tasty. {\an2}Elenora. {\an2}Right. I'll go supervise. {\an2}I take it you condition her to respect you, too? {\an2}The cyborgs need conditioning to be usable. {\an2}Henrietta's no exception. {\an2}But I don't increase her conditioning to make her loyal, {\an2}nor do I force her affection for me. {\an2}How's that any different? {\an2}Just because it's not as much doesn't make it acceptable. {\an2}I agree with that. {\an2}I know we're using her for our own sakes. {\an2}I realize that. {\an2}What are you planning to make? {\an2}Well... Tomato soup pasta... {\an2}That's all? {\an2}Yes. {\an2}Let's add some things. {\an2}But I can't cook without recipes... {\an2}I had cooking notes somewhere... {\an2}Here we are! {\an2}Tomato soup with tuna for the pasta, {\an2}and then some marinated seafood with vegetable caponata. {\an2}How's that sound? {\an2}Amazing! It's a magical notebook! {\an2}I just have a bad memory. {\an2}Without this, I'd be fired from the agency in a second. {\an2}Listen. All successful jobs are-- {\an2}comprised of smaller, simpler tasks. {\an2}Right. {\an2}Huh? Where did you hear that? {\an2}I'm not sure. I don't seem to remember. {\an2}Oh, well. {\an2}-First, let's go shopping! -Okay! {\an2}You really like him, don't you? What kind of feeling is it? {\an2}Are you aware that those feelings may be the agency's doing? {\an2}I'm happy right now, so I don't mind. {\an2}But I have to do what the agency orders. {\an2}What I do for Giuse-san I want to do. {\an2}You're really in love. {\an2}You're in love with Fermi-san, aren't you? {\an2}Just because a man and a woman work together {\an2}doesn't mean they're in love. {\an2}But you're tall and pretty like a model, {\an2}and you really suit him! {\an2}A tougher woman would suit him better. {\an2}-That's not true. -Yes, it is. {\an2}Henrietta! {\an2}You girls are vulnerable when you're not concentrating... {\an2}Here. {\an2}Thank you. {\an2}Oh? Where's your handbag? {\an2}-I'll get him! -Wait! {\an2}There he is! {\an2}Give that back! {\an2}H-How did you... {\an2}Give me back my purse! {\an2}Give me back my purse! {\an2}Yeah, right! Get lost! {\an2}What the... {\an2}S-Stop... {\an2}Stop right there! {\an2}Taormina Police! Return that girl's things! {\an2}What things?! Just do something about this brat! {\an2}Henrietta, let him go. {\an2}Now give it back! {\an2}-What are you talking about? -Playing dumb, huh? {\an2}I was going to let you go if you gave it back, {\an2}but maybe I should perform a more thorough search. {\an2}You stink of marijuana. {\an2}Was that really that important? {\an2}The camera Giuse-san gave me was inside it. {\an2}I see... {\an2}Gabrielli-san, was that notebook actually-- {\an2}The magical notebook. {\an2}Just now, you were the toughest woman ever! {\an2}Just now, you were the scariest girl ever. {\an2}You're not suspicious of Elsa's death? {\an2}Does something make you suspicious? {\an2}Yeah. {\an2}If you ask me, it seems a little too convenient. {\an2}What, you think it was a conspiracy? {\an2}A trained man and a cyborg are murdered, {\an2}then they suddenly know who did it. {\an2}What do you think? {\an2}As enhanced as the cyborgs' abilities and senses are, {\an2}they're useless if they're not concentrating. {\an2}And they were ambushed in the park at night. {\an2}But Jean said they're sensitive to danger their masters may be in. {\an2}When I met Rico yesterday, she was practically an Aegis Shield. {\an2}She reacted, but not in time, {\an2}so she probably did act as Lauro's shield. {\an2}I don't like it. {\an2}Why are you all so quick to say the cyborg protected her master? {\an2}While it may be the truth, that's just not right. {\an2}The idea of cyborgs disgusted me at first. {\an2}Over half of their bodies are carbon frames, fibers, {\an2}and artificial muscle. {\an2}But in the end, they're regular adolescent girls. {\an2}Girls who can't cook worth a crap. {\an2}You're saying it's ok if Henrietta dies protecting you? {\an2}They really enjoyed the food! {\an2}We did work hard to make it. {\an2}Listen, Henrietta. {\an2}Don't run off like that anymore. {\an2}Girls can't always be violent. Okay? {\an2}You too, Gabrielli-san... {\an2}You're trying to make me into a girl too, aren't you? {\an2}But you really are-- {\an2}When we came here, Giuse-san took my gun away. {\an2}He said normal girls don't carry them. {\an2}I know he's right, but... {\an2}...am I a normal girl? {\an2}I'm really strong, and can kill people with my bare hands. {\an2}I bleed red blood, but the pain goes away fast. {\an2}I'm a cyborg, so I can't be useful to Giuse-san as a normal girl... {\an2}That's not true! {\an2}He thinks the world of you. {\an2}He wants you to smile. {\an2}Gabrielli-san... {\an2}I know why Elsa died. {\an2}Go get the others... {\an2}And bring me my gun... {\an2}-Please give me my gun. -Wait. Explain first. {\an2}Fermi-san, Elsa loved Lauro-san, right? {\an2}That's the impression I get. {\an2}Giuse-san, was Lauro-san nice to Elsa? {\an2}No, he never paid her much attention outside of work. {\an2}Yes. This is probably how it really happened. {\an2}If you loved someone with all of your heart {\an2}but realized they would never feel the same way... {\an2}If it were me... {\an2}...I would kill that person... {\an2}...and then... {\an2}...do this. {\an2}Don't worry. I wouldn't shoot. {\an2}I'd never kill myself. You're so wonderfully nice to me. {\an2}I had no idea how serious she was... {\an2}Talk about a scare... {\an2}You knew how Elsa died from the start, didn't you? {\an2}That's why when I went to give her the gun-- {\an2}So that was the secret behind those two bullets... {\an2}That's even worse than dying for her master. {\an2}-Are you going to report this? -Don't be stupid. {\an2}Section 2 would've destroyed the evidence by now. {\an2}That'd leave it as a simple theory. {\an2}But the way Henrietta acted earlier... {\an2}That was an unconscious threat. {\an2}Kinda like saying, "I'll shoot you if you won't love me." {\an2}She seemed so innocent just this afternoon... {\an2}That's why she's hard to deal with. {\an2}Oh, yeah. I found one thing in Elsa's room. {\an2}A photo of Lauro. {\an2}So all she ever got from him was her name and his picture... {\an2}All that affection must've been hard to deal with. {\an2}Your ordinary guy probably couldn't handle it. {\an2}You always have to be someone they can respect. {\an2}That's the very least you need to do... {\an2}So what do you want out here? {\an2}Lauro-san, do you remember this park? {\an2}You named me here. 'Elsa De Sica.' {\an2}Really? I can't believe you remember that... {\an2}It's important. I would never forget it. {\an2}I would never forget the treasure you gave me. {\an2}You done? {\an2}Let's go. We have an early start tomorrow. {\an2}You gave me my name here. {\an2}-So long, Henrietta! -Goodbye. {\an2}-See ya. -Yeah. {\an2}Now then, where do you want to go first? {\an2}Sicily is full of places to see. {\an2}Giuse-san! {\an2}We'll leave right away. Don't forget your camera. {\an2}I won't! {\an2}SYMBIOSIS
