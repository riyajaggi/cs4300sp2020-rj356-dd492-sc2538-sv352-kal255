 Gunslinger Girl (2003â€“2004): Season 1, Episode 2 - Orione - full transcript 
 Following Henrietta's breakdown, Jose begins to question the moral controversy of "conditioning", a process where the emotions and memories of the girls are manipulated so they are obedient to Section 2. More of Henrietta's training and past are shown to further reveal what is behind her over-protective nature as well as the reasoning behind Jose's very caring and brotherly relationship with her.

 {\an2}Pinocchio. {\an2}Do you remember the target's face? {\an2}Yes, sir! {\an2}I'll wait at the spot for 20 minutes. {\an2}If you don't make it back by then, you're on your own. {\an2}Right! {\an2}Are you sure about this? He's only a child... {\an2}It was his own suggestion. {\an2}John Doe was very enthusiastic about it, as well. {\an2}I see... {\an2}Amid the difficulty of sticking to that one feeling,

 {\an2}I want to protect you and fulfill my promise to the only one for me {\an2}In a world filled with doubt, I still can't find the answer {\an2}Even so, I continue forward-- Why? {\an2}If I can change this dream-like reality with my own two hands, {\an2}amid the difficulty of sticking to that one feeling, {\an2}I want to protect the only one for me {\an2}I swear on my beating heart I will continue to run until I burn away {\an2}Amid the eternal love I feel simply by living, {\an2}I want to fulfill my promise {\an8}Montalcino, Tuscany Region {\an2}Good morning, Pinocchio! {\an2}Good morning, Aurora. {\an2}Are you on your way to work now? Where to? {\an2}Genoa.

 {\an2}Genoa? That's far! When will you be back? {\an2}I'm not sure. {\an2}Have fun! {\an8}PINOCCHIO {\an2}Then it's simple. Repay your debt. {\an2}But... I'm still just a child... {\an2}Even a dog could do it. {\an2}Do you come up with excuses before you begin? {\an2}That makes you even less than a dog. {\an2}Hey there, Pinocchio. How'd it go? {\an2}Why are you up there? {\an2}Why? {\an2}That ain't an observatory. {\an2}Don't you know? "Mercedes" is a woman's name. {\an2}They gave it a girl's name 100 years ago. {\an2}Then I better get off her. {\an2}Treat girls with respect. {\an2}Have your old man teach you more of the ropes sometime. {\an2}I'm not good around girls. {\an2}Bruno filled me in. It seems everything went off without a hitch. {\an2}Yes, sir. {\an2}Are things going well for you in Montalcino? {\an2}Socializing with people is an annoyance. {\an2}I know I could be more helpful to you if I lived here, in Milan... {\an2}It's best that you learn a little about the world. {\an2}Otherwise, you'll be of little use down the road. {\an2}You'll see some more action soon enough. {\an2}It'll be a big job, with some other people. {\an2}Meet up with them at Montalcino and prepare the plan. {\an2}Yes, sir. {\an2}My countrymen! You must not lend your ears to the separatists! {\an2}Their violent methods are nothing more than the logic of the strong! {\an2}All they care about {\an2}is protecting their families and their families' fortunes! {\an2}They have forgotten their duties as Christians {\an2}to help and care for others! {\an2}Italy must abandon this regionalism {\an2}and unify itself in the truest sense of the word! {\an2}Italy! European brethren! {\an2}I apologize for the wait. {\an2}The world is currently moving toward regionalism and nationalism! {\an2}Let us begin, then. {\an2}Today's topic is about what policy our Milan Group should adopt. {\an2}We can no longer use the public to hold citizen demonstrations, {\an2}like the one in Rome two months ago. {\an2}We must do something new. {\an2}Are you referring to the Strait of Messina Bridge? {\an2}I'm currently drawing up a plan to blow it up. {\an2}If we force such a large-scale public works project to halt, {\an2}we can keep the south from sucking the north's immense taxes dry. {\an2}Those bomb experts? Franco and Franca? {\an2}I'm teaming Pinocchio with them. {\an2}Stopping the construction of the Messina Bridge {\an2}has been our ardent wish for many years. {\an2}I approve of its sabotage. {\an2}However, let us explore other methods as well. {\an2}After all, we can't simply blow up anything at anytime. {\an2}Pinocchio is the boy you took in long ago, yes? {\an2}He's worked under me for a very long time. {\an2}He was the one who eliminated the judge two days ago. {\an2}So, showing pity was the best choice... {\an2}The search continues for Judge Berdini, {\an2}who disappeared from a party in Genoa two days ago. {\an2}Because the judge presided over the tax-evasion trial of Mr. Pirazzi, {\an2}a wealthy and famous Five Republics Faction supporter from Milan, {\an2}local authorities are investigating the possibility {\an2}that he was abducted by the Northern Independence Faction. {\an2}Franca. Cristiano's contacted us. {\an2}Says he has a job... {\an2}He wants more bombs? {\an2}Not this time. {\an2}It sounds like Milan's in a state of confusion. {\an2}Plus our big sponsor seems to be having court trouble... {\an2}I hear the government has a secret agency out in full force. {\an2}Word has it they use children assassins. {\an2}Are you serious? That's hard to believe. {\an2}It comes from a very reliable source. {\an2}Apparently, the same organization intercepted Cristiano's men {\an2}during that accountant incident in Florence early last winter. {\an2}So, what does Cristiano say? {\an2}To meet up with Pinocchio in Montalcino. {\an2}Pinocchio? That's his son, isn't it? {\an2}No. Though he's like a son. {\an2}I hear he's a skilled assassin he took in a long while back. {\an2}Pino! {\an2}Hey. {\an2}You came home today! I was lonely without you! {\an2}My mom thought you might come home soon, {\an2}so she bought lots of prosciutto and salami and stuff! {\an2}I told you, you don't have to do that. {\an2}I just live in the neighborhood, that's all. {\an2}It's because you're cool, Pino! {\an2}Being cool makes life easier! {\an2}Say, Pino. What's your job? {\an2}I'm just an errand boy. {\an2}Eh?! I thought you were something cooler than that. {\an2}Like an artist or something... {\an2}Well, bye! I'll bring you some food later! {\an2}It's a wonderful spring day! {\an2}Yeah. {\an2}It's the perfect season for driving! {\an2}That it is. {\an2}You're such a sociable person! {\an2}Franco and Franca, I take it? {\an2}Have we met before? {\an2}No, this is our first time. Where should I put the car? {\an2}I'll show you the way. {\an2}Mind if I go on inside? {\an2}Be my guest. {\an2}Is this a Mercedes, too? {\an2}It's an Alfa Romeo Giulietta. {\an2}Are you really Italian? {\an2}Is this a girl, too? {\an2}Are you two brother and sister? {\an2}He's my partner, my bodyguard, and my explosives teacher. {\an2}We have no blood relation. {\an2}Pinocchio is an interesting name. {\an2}My old man gave it to me. {\an2}Oh? Does that mean Cristiano is Geppetto, {\an2}and you're the troublemaker whose nose gets long? {\an2}I'm his devoted son. {\an2}Alright, then. Mind if I take a shower first? {\an2}Go ahead. {\an2}Cristiano told us to work with you to blow up the bridge. {\an2}So I hear. {\an2}Can we trust you? {\an2}Can you not? {\an2}I only trust what I've seen for myself. {\an2}That goes for you and your skill. {\an2}I hear knives are your specialty. {\an2}I'm best with a knife, I'd say. {\an2}Guns are scary. {\an2}In that case... {\an2}What would you do in a situation like this? {\an2}Is that a serious question? {\an2}I could kill you in the blink of an eye. {\an2}And if this distance was 10 meters? {\an2}I'd get 9 meters closer. {\an2}That's easier said than done. {\an2}Yes. {\an2}Your left leg has an old injury. I guess I'd take advantage of that first. {\an2}Would you like to give it a try? {\an2}No, that's all right. {\an2}Where'd he go? {\an2}Shopping. {\an2}Did you two have a fight while I was gone? {\an2}Fight? {\an2}You seemed really wary of him. {\an2}We're freelance terrorists. Being suspicious of others is only natural. {\an2}True. {\an2}Pinocchio is known for being eccentric. And he really is... {\an2}Oh? Are we anyone to talk? {\an2}You're different. {\an2}So I'm the odd one out here? {\an2}Do you like him? {\an2}I don't know. But he does interest me. {\an2}Maybe it's the maternal instinct in me. {\an2}Buona sera, Pino! {\an2}Shopping? {\an2}Yeah. {\an2}Why do you have so much? I didn't know you drank wine... {\an2}I have guests. {\an2}Really? Then I'll ask my mom to make some food for them-- {\an2}I'm sorry. I'll pass. {\an2}Oh... {\an2}Aurora. {\an2}Yes?! {\an2}Could you stop hanging around me? {\an2}Eh? {\an2}You're a nuisance. {\an2}And you'll only wind up in trouble if you stay around me. {\an2}Why? {\an2}Because I'm Pinocchio, the little troublemaker boy. {\an2}This is the Strait of Messina Bridge? {\an2}You don't know anything, do you? {\an2}That's a CG mockup of when it's done. {\an2}If it's completed, it'll be the world's largest suspension bridge, {\an2}but only its support columns have actually been built so far. {\an2}If we're going to blow anything up, it'll be one of those two. {\an2}Hmm... {\an2}The north is paying for almost all of the construction costs. {\an2}But all the concessions will go to the crooks in the south. {\an2}The F.R.F. wants to stop its construction more than anything. {\an2}It'll be a big job. {\an2}When we blow it up, will we plant the bombs ourselves? {\an2}Of course. {\an2}Amateurs wouldn't be able to take down a structure like this. {\an2}Besides, relying on others sometimes gets innocent people involved. {\an2}You don't like killing? {\an2}I only approve of necessary killing. {\an2}Otherwise, that'd make me an ordinary outlaw. {\an2}Franca is a strange person. {\an2}Most of the terrorists I've met have been angry about something, {\an2}but her anger is gentle. {\an2}Yeah? {\an2}It's just too bad she's nice enough to choose who she kills. {\an2}That would only be a hindrance, in my opinion. {\an2}She's not an ordinary terrorist. {\an2}Honestly? She doesn't care about stopping the bridge's construction. {\an2}How about you, Franco? {\an2}I have no ideas and principles. {\an2}I hear you and Cristiano are close. {\an2}He did raise me. {\an2}Is that your reason for swearing loyalty? {\an2}He's... everything I have. {\an2}What is Franca to you? {\an2}I'm a man who's lost his goals... {\an2}but she gives me new ones. {\an2}I'm amazed that Angelica has recovered this well. {\an2}I don't know if she can be used for work yet. {\an2}After all, she just got out of the medical ward. {\an2}We go to Milan tomorrow. {\an2}I hear Special Ops Section 1 is sending you off to Montalcino? {\an2}Yeah. Apparently a Public Safety official's gone missing there. {\an2}They say Public Safety's desperately looking {\an2}for an F.R.F. assassin called "Pinocchio" now. {\an2}My own trip to Milan is connected to that, even. {\an2}Watch yourself. Milan is a large base for the F.R.F. {\an2}Yeah, I know. {\an2}You be careful, too. {\an2}Section 1 blames us whenever anything happens. {\an2}They might try to screw Section 2 over and laugh from the shadows. {\an2}Yeah. I'll be careful. {\an2}A doll without a heart, born from warm hands {\an2}I neither smile nor talk {\an2}I want you to hear about these feelings someday, {\an2}though they can't be put into words {\an2}I'll summon all my strength {\an2}to know what it means to live {\an2}Next Episode: SIMULACRA
