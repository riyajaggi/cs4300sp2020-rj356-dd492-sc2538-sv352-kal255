 Let's see... Sorry to keep you waiting. I-is this Lt. Col. Roy Mustang? My humble name is Edward Elric... Humble? You don't have to be so tense. R-right! We'll be boarding the 9:20 train bound for Central. Roger. Er, hold on... There's one before that, isn't there? - Yes there is, but it sounds like it's already leaving. - Now departing! Now departing! Get on that one. But why...?

 Just hop aboard that one! Al! We're getting on! Hurry! I'm testing their luck. Man cannot obtain anything without first sacrificing something. In order to obtain anything, something of equal value is required. That is alchemy's Law of Equivalent Exchange. At the time, we believed that to be the true way of the world. I don't get Lt. Col. Mustang. I wonder what kind of person he is. Brother, am I scary? No, I wouldn't say- Say, there's someone strange over there! Strange? Marin, that's not nice. Keep quiet.

 But he's funny! For him to wear his armor inside the train, he must really like it, huh? There's nothing particularly strange about us! There, you see? She likes you! Right? Pretty cool, huh? There now, Marin, that's enough already. Looks like they're tired out from too much romping around. Yes. I'm so glad that you've been able to travel like this without any incident, General Hakuro. They said that the situation to the east was unstable, but then, here we are. My, my, the higher-ups sure do take it easy. By the way, where is Maj. Hughes right now? He is communicating with Lt. Col. Mustang about that other matter. That other matter? Yes... Well, I hope so... So, you see... ever since my wife got pregnant, she's becoming more and more pretty... How should I put it? She's like an angel who has waltzed her way down to earth- Huh? We got cut off again. What lousy conditions for communications! I can't do anything with this! You're the one we can't do anything with! I'd better make another round if I'm going to keep myself from worrying. Hello? My, my... So, listen, what am I going to do if the baby is born tomorrow? Hughes... I've heard this story about fifty times now... If you want to talk about this, take it up with your wife directly! I have! Just a little while ago! Then don't ask me!! Pardon me for breaking in. Major, a piece of advice... The baby won't be born after just five months!! Huh? What was that? I can't hear too well over this phone. That's suspicious...! That's enough, Hughes. We just got confirmation that there's no one monitoring communications. So, how about it? Have you seen anyone suspicious? No. Or so I'd like to tell you. There have been more passengers getting on and off than anticipated. If you factor in the private rooms... What is it? They're here! They're here? They're here! Someone awfully suspicious! What!? They're wearing armor this huge...! Armor? That guy is fine. Is there another... ...pipsqueak together with him? Pip - ? He was right! He is here! And he really is little! Who are you calling so puny that you can only make him out under a magnifying glass!? No, I was just... I'm not the one who said so... Be quiet! Everyone, get your hands up! W-why, you...! Good day, General Hakuro. Hey, Hughes! What is it? Has something happened? Hey, Hughes! Hey, inform Bald that we have taken the wireless! It doesn't look like anyone was using it, either! Is it them, after all? There's a call for headquarters from General Hakuro aboard the train heading for Central. It's an emergency. Put it through. It's me. Lt. Colonel? Is this Lt. Col. Mustang? This is Bald, of the Eastern Liberation Front "Blue Squad." We have taken control of this train. What are your demands? Don't play dumb! We suddenly lost contact with one of our allies today. Someone who was supposed to have delivered a statement to you. What are you talking about? Okay, fine. Bring our leader in Prison No. 8 to Central Station. We'll exchange prisoners there. Very well. In exchange, don't kill anyone. If you do- Are you sure about this? We do have a statement here, but if the general finds out, he's going to ask who was responsible. No problem. As long as the situation gets resolved, right? I've already taken sufficient measures. What is this man Mustang thinking? If he does anything funny, then it won't just be you! Consider all of the passengers dead! Brother... Yeah... Hey, you two... Why, you...! Hey, now that you've done that, what do we do? When their buddies come to get back at us for this... He's right. If you hadn't resisted, we probably would have gotten to Central without any trouble. He's right... What do we do? You're asking me? Are you all right!? Yes... Sorry about that. Your big brothers will take care of this somehow, okay? Let's go, Al. Mm-hmm. Hey, you guys...! This is embarrassing. Who on earth are you? We're just ordinary alchemists. Really? I'm Falman. Warrant Officer. A soldier? You don't look at all like one! There's a reason why I'm dressed like this. You see, up in the first car... Then, that's who the criminals are after...? And they're dragging all the others into it! Al, I'll go at them from above. You take them from below, with this man. Mm-hmm. W-what? Hey! Come quick! There's something funny going on behind us! Ah! You'd better not shoot! I was about to tell you that you risked ricochets by shooting. What's going on!? Ah! You'd better not shoot! Hey, Bald! Contact from behind us has been cut off! What's going on!? So, you did have something set up, did you? G-give up, already. Turn yourselves over, and release the other passengers. Things just aren't going to go your way this time! Darling! We're the only ones giving orders here, General. Check all of the cars on this train again! And examine the outside of the cars, too! Hey, are you all right? I'm surprised you got this far. I'm Hughes. Edward Elric, right? Huh? Y-yes...! I heard about you from Lt. Col. Mustang. From the Lt. Colonel!? Yeah. Now then, you'll work with me. I've already checked things out below us. What's the matter? Who are you-? There you are, there you are. Take this! Are you all right!? What!? Whoa, that was awesome! Hey, you! Don't mess around with the tender! It's the life of this train! Yeah, sorry! Tender, huh? You can't, Bald! There's someone outrageous up there! Bald! Contact with everywhere else has been cut off! They said something about a big suit of armor! Don't get excited! You guys in the criminal group. Can you hear me? What's... that? All right, you guys! Threaten everyone else, will you!? Let the hostages go! Are you one of Mustang's secret agents!? If you interfere, I'll kill the hostages, one by one! Oh, you're just itching to do it, huh? Well, then... A water... pipe...? Okay, hostages, please take cover! What!? Welcome! All right, don't move. You're the ringleader, aren't you? What's the matter? Come on out. Damn...! Before I kill the general, I'll take care of you! Hold it! A fellow automailer, huh? A brat like you...? Is the military using even children now? You'll pay for that "brat" line! And I'm not being used by anyone! Kid, let me tell you something. I used to be in the military, long ago. At the time, I thought I wanted to be better armed. But the military didn't seem to like that idea. They were afraid of me becoming any stronger on my own. Shortly after I had this operation, they got rid of me. And so... and so... I wanted to crush the military! You understand, don't you? If you've got an arm like that, then you must have wanted it too! You wanted to be stronger than anyone else! No, I don't understand! And don't you lump my arm in... with yours!! Good grief, that was something else. Don't kill anyone. That's what I told you. As it turns out, it looks like you did as you were told. You're Mustang, are you? A-awesome! I held back. The effect on your body probably isn't as bad as it looks. I am Roy Mustang. My rank is Lt. Colonel, and I am the Flame Alchemist. Remember that. He's Mustang... Brother! Lt. Colonel! Why, you... you knew about all of this when you had us get on this train, huh!? It's not as if I had a grasp of everything. More importantly, though, I have good news. His generalship heard about your exploits, and he said he would specially allow you to take the State Alchemist Certification Exam. Specially? But, we came because you told us to take it...! There's no way a child could take such an important military test, you know. Now, aren't you glad that I had you take this train? Whether you take the test or not is still up to you. Of course we're going to take it! We'll take it, all right! Apparently, those people had us dancing right in the palm of their hand. But then, there was no way around it. We still don't have any power. There he is! Over here! Over here! Marin! Big brother, thank you! Thank you! Fullmetal Alchemist! Episode 6: "The State Alchemist Certification Examination" Everyone but me thinks it's impossible for Brother to pass. But then, on that day, miraculous flowers will bloom.
