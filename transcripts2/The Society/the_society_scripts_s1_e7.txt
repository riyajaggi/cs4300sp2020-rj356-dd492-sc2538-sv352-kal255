 [Becca] Six months ago, we were children. This is who we are now. We eat and live communally. We even sweat communally. This is all according to Cassandra's rules. Now, they are Allie's rules as well. A midnight curfew, mandatory weekly town meetings, and the community doctrine: those who don't work... don't eat.

 We found a balance between doing what's expected of us and finding happiness where we can. In love, or in sex, or play. We waffle between following the rules and bending them, constantly worrying that if we bend too far, this whole rickety structure might topple and break. Because we know that we're always one dumb move away from ruin. Can I help you? I need to come in. And why would I let you do that? Shoe here is now part of the Guard.

 Lotus? The Guard's here to see you. [Lotus sniffles] Am I in trouble? Your shift manager at the cafeteria says you haven't been to work in the last three days. No, I can go. I just... Just give me a second. You know what? It's okay. We didn't know you were sick. Just let us know when you feel better and no extra days off, okay? [sneezes] [upbeat music plays] [sighs] Hey. You like cars? Huh? Do you like cars? Yeah, I guess. You've seen what I drive. It's yours if you take a couple of my shifts a week. Are you serious? You get the car one day for every two that you take. [Gretchen] What are you doing? [boy] Harry's gonna trade me his car for work shifts. You want in on this? That's against the rules. No shift-shirking. I'll tell the Guard. And you wonder why no one liked you in school. [laughs wryly] I know that you used to strut around like you owned the place, but what exactly makes you think you're so special now? Nothing. [scoffs] [sniffles] [knocking on door] [boy] Clark. - Oh, shit. - [knocking continues] Uh... One minute. Naked. Yo, Clark, are you in there? Shh. - [knocking continues] - [boy] Clark! Dude! Hang on! Just give me a sec! Come in. Jason and Shoe are downstairs for you. Guard duty. Then I will be down in a minute. Hey, I don't know if I want to do this anymore. We're not a couple, and pretending sort of hurts my insides. Are you serious? It'd be different if we were at least trying to get back together, but... Can I... Can I steal your eyes for a second? Yeah. This... This is ours. All ours. Because couples get private rooms. And if it hurts your insides too much, sure, fuck it all. We can go public and give up our private ensuite bathroom and TV if that's what your insides truly want. You can jack off in the communal shitter like the rest of them. Where is everybody? It's so quiet. Must be out. All at the same time? There's a problem in the cafeteria. And all of you had to come tell me now? We wanted to do this together. Who's watching... Grizz... This is for Dewey. [gasps] Jason slit your throat. - Grizz shot me. - Grizz? Didn't think he had it in him. That's not funny. You know this is all in your head, right? It's not that simple. I set the rules when I killed someone. And what goes around comes around. It's history. Like Julius Caesar. Hey, you're doing a great job. People feel safe. Things work. They're happy. Mm-mm. They're putting up with it, maybe. But I doubt happy. You know, what do they say when we can't hear them? That's what I'm afraid of. And things are about to get so much worse. Uh, so, new class sign-up sheets are posted in the church lobby. Um, we've just added an improv class, and due to popular demand, a second jiu-jitsu class. Oh, and finally, I hope to see you all tomorrow for movie night. Here you go. Thank you, Gwen. Okay, I just want to remind everybody that this Thursday is Thanksgiving, so bring all your recipes to Will so that he can make sure that you guys all have the right ingredients. Next, we have an update from the Committee on Resources. What about the Committee on Going Home? Gordie and Bean promised me a report on Thursday. Are we going home? Not before Thursday. [crowd laughs] [Allie] Will? Okay. So, we finished our audit on food supplies, and based on our current rationing, we have enough to carry us through spring. This winter won't be a problem, but our food won't last forever. We all knew that. It'll start to run low by next summer. [crowd murmurs] So we're all going to fucking starve? No. Of course not. We just got to change the way we do things. We have a plan. Grizz? Um... So after Thanksgiving, I'm going to lead a search party to look for farmland and for alternative food supplies. If anyone wants to join me, I'm looking for four or five volunteers - to come along with me. - [boy] No fucking way! Look, we all know what happened to Emily. But this is different. We know what to expect now. We'll be prepared. We'll bring proper supplies. [girl] Yeah, but we don't know how to farm. Like, even if you find this land, who's gonna work it? [Allie] We will. All of us. We'll have to learn how. Just like we learned to do everything else around here. I know it's a lot, and we still have to cook, and clean, and do everything else that makes this place work. It's going to get tougher. But what choice do we have? Right? No choice. So we'll do it. Fuck. We're just gonna take it step by step, okay? Just... solve each problem as it comes. And I think we can do that... if we stay positive. [shutter clicks] Still taking pictures? It's our first fall. Someone has to record our history in case we survive. Or not. Right. I've been saving up a portion of my rations over the last few months in case of an emergency. Am... Am I an emergency? Well, you're the only person I know who's eating for two. When are you due? In a month. Or so. I'm still tryin' to figure that out. Who's the father? Sam. Really? I... I thought he was gay. Right, well... Some people are more than they seem to be. Listen, there's things that you and Sam can do in secret, but having a baby is not one of them. Let me help you. What? Are you a doctor now? In this universe, maybe. [Will] You should take your own advice. Positive. They heard you, I think. Yeah, they heard me. I could see it in their faces. [sighs] My best case scenario... if Grizz gets lucky... is that I force people to work in the fields. And not modern farming. Like, back-breaking stuff. Yeah. So they don't starve. It's a fucking lot. And what authority do I have to tell them to do that, you know? The fact that my sister died five months ago and that I inherited her job? If you're so worried about it, why don't you call elections? What? You want the authority? Ask for them to give it to you. - Let them make the choice. - That's a terrible idea. Okay. That's what a dictator would say. Don't be an asshole. If we call elections, you're asking them to pick sides. It'll be us against them. That's how it works. We're not ready for that. They trust you, Allie. They'll vote for you. I get it. I said no. Now look who's being an asshole. [Kelly] Hey. Didn't expect to see you here. I need to release some frustration, it turns out. You into martial arts? I love karate. [giggles] This is jiu-jitsu. [door opens] That too. [teacher] Sorry I'm late. Grab a partner. Work on passing the guard for a warm up. What the hell does that mean? Now try to get up. What if I don't want to? Well, that's when this happens. Now I can wreck you. [both laugh] [sighs] [sniffles] - Hey, babe... - You can't see me like this! I'm sorry. I didn't see anything, but I kind of did, and you're, like, the most gorgeous thing I've ever seen in my whole fucking life. Sorry. Just knock next time, okay? It's my mom's dress. She had great taste. I was looking at pictures of her on her wedding day. We look almost identical. The only person who looked happier that day was her mom. Hey, if you want to wait, you know, in case our parents... You know... No. I don't want to wait for anything. Keeping my fingers crossed that someone's going to come save us? I want to do this. I want to be married... in front of everyone... at the church. Okay. All right. Then we'll do it. [giggles] I really hope that's supposed to be there. [sighs] Hey. I was looking for you. You have the last word. I get that, and you don't ever have to take my advice, but... don't dismiss me. I've been dismissed by people my entire life. I'm done with that. And I'm not gonna take it from you. Right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What were you looking for, anyway? [sighs] Do you know what ambrosia is? My grandma used to make it every year. It's like... marshmallow throw-up, but... it doesn't really feel like the holiday without it. I'm glad you have good memories of it. Personally, Thanksgiving isn't really my thing. Really? Not even with the one family? The one with all the girls? - The Dooleys? - Yes. With their five daughters? Mm-hmm. Too long ago, too short a time. Well, I'm gonna make us ambrosia, and we're going to start our own tradition. You're gonna hate it. [laughs] Hi, Tom. Hey, Summer. I must've walked right by you. [Summer] Yeah. This is better than walking to the church in the rain, huh? [Tom] You're going to Lily's? Me too. What are they even playing tonight? I don't know. I didn't check. [Summer] I love Lilly. She's the sweetest. So I was... thinking... [Summer] Well, I was gonna go get a coffee. Instead of having Thanksgiving with the same people that we see every day... we could just pick up our rations and celebrate it one-on-one here at home. What do you think? - [Tom] Then what happened? - [Summer] This can't come as a... Yeah, I'd love that. That's my girl. [Tom] Summer, Sid stabbed Nancy seven times with a kitchen knife. I hardly think I'm Sid Vicious. [Summer] No, I'm Sid. - He hasn't been here for two days? - No. - Has anyone seen him? - No. Okay. You did the right thing telling us. I think he's depressed. I mean, he shows all the signs, you know? Sleeping, not eating, won't talk to anyone. My mom used to struggle with it too until, you know, she left my dad for her personal trainer. Just go easy on him, okay? 'Sup, man? Gretchen says you haven't been at work in a couple days. Go away. Seriously, man? You can't just ditch work. They're gonna start docking your rations. We'll have to tell Allie. I don't care. [Jason] You sure about that? - Thanks again for doing this for me, guys. - Sure. Just, I know it's silly, the world being what it is, who gives a fuck about the institution of marriage? But... it's important to me, so I appreciate it. Yeah. All right. Um... What are you thinking? Any of these guys? Yeah. [Luke] That's nice, right? [Clark] I don't know why you're fretting so hard on this ring shit. It's not like you're buying anything for her. You're just handing it to her. Well, I want to do it right, you know? She's special. I want her to feel special. She sees in me who I can be, not just the dude I think I am. When someone sees you like that, you want them looking at you forever. What are you doing here? Gordie said I could find you in the, um, library. - Oh, okay. - Oh, one second. Let me just... [exhales] Okay. Um... Fuck. Uh... Yeah. Um... No? Uh, you don't look so impressed. Am I supposed to understand that? You didn't? Nah. Fuck. That's... What are you doing? I'm trying to speak in gibberish apparently. It's just... I wanted... I wanted to say, "How are you? It's nice to see you. How do you like my sign language?" [laughs] What? What? This is BSL. Yeah. I use ASL. They're different? Yeah. Come on, man. It's the only book I could find! Why are you learning sign language? Are you planning on going deaf? No, I'm not. I just... I wanted to be able to talk to you. Or, you know, sign to you. I can read lips. I know. I want to be able to talk to you, you know, in your language. Oh. Shouldn't you be getting ready for this trip? Yeah, sure. But I'm also preparing for when I get back. Hey, babe. [Helena] First Thanksgiving... What was the name of that tribe? We did a play about them in fifth grade. It starts with a W. - Oh, the Wampanoags. - Yes. Who died? [clears throat] Look, I've been thinking, - and I just want to say... - Okay, this is very... [shushes] No offense, but... [clears throat] I like who I am in your eyes. I like how you see me. God, that sounds dumb. I get what you're doing, but it's not... No, it is necessary, because we skipped this part. And I don't want to skip anything when it comes to you. I want to do it the right way. Will you marry me? Oh... It's nice! [laughs] It's really nice! It's just... Don't hate me. I... don't want to wear something that we couldn't have afforded in the real world. - Right. - You know? Yeah, no, I get it. That's why... this isn't your ring. Yours is the one near my heart. I see you, too. Are you okay? I don't want to see anyone. Especially you. You don't have to be ashamed. I think we know each other pretty well. Unless you forgot about the last time I was in this room. This is different. I get it. Okay? I get it. After Cassandra died, I didn't want to do anything. I mean, fuck people. Fuck food. Fuck everything. I wanted to just lay in bed and never get out. And then you got up. Good for you. 'Cause I had no choice. And honestly, neither do you. You have to get back up. Because if I let you sink, I make it okay for other people to do that, too, and that's suicide. You have to get up. You have to get up and get back to work. And it's not going to make you feel any better. It's not going to make this suck any less. But it's the rule. It's how we survive. You don't do your work, your rations get cut in half. No exceptions. I hope the next time I get a report on you it's that your sweeping up the cafeteria again. Feel better. Hi, everyone. Hey. Uh, welcome to Thanksgiving services. I just wanted to remind everyone that cooking starts at 11:00 a.m. in the cafeteria. And touch football kicks off at 3:00 p.m. on the green. [sighs] What a nice day it's going to be, right? Maybe not. I don't know. Who cares about turkey and football when we have no idea what's happened to our families... to us, for that matter? I mean, what is there to be thankful for when everything feels like... Like prison? Like prison. We're trapped here. And we do only mundane things. Making it from today to tomorrow, and tomorrow is not likely to be any different. That feels a lot like prison. [sighs] But... my guess is, by the time it finally came for each of us to die... maybe one in 100 of us would have made any difference for having been born. But here, every one of us matters. Think about it. If we were to lose a single person in this room, we would all feel it tomorrow, and... I don't just mean in our hearts. I mean, the food wouldn't be cooked, the trash wouldn't be collected, the streets wouldn't be safe. Lose too many of us, and we might not eat at all. Our lives have consequences. Everyone in our entire universe matters to everyone else. And we can still love. So... I am thankful today for every one of you, and... I'm happy to be alive... and to matter. [practices laughing] [breathes deeply] This is where you want me to have my baby? That's the idea. [Becca] You know, I can feel my baby. You really don't have to do this. - It's fine. - Just wait. I'm really fine. - Just give me a moment. - It feels weird, and it's cold. I swear, I don't... [chuckles] Holy shit. [laughs] Holy shit. Happy Thanksgiving, Mama. [laughs] Can you get the bowl? This makes me happy. Good. It's gonna take me a few hours, so I need you to get out of the kitchen. - Oh. - Okay? Amuse yourself. Go and... Go and take a nap. I never much liked Thanksgiving before this. No? Why not? Forced affection, family... It's not really my thing. I'd watch everyone like I was outside a window, looking into a house at a family I didn't really know. But I knew that they were really feeling all those things. They really did miss each other, that just eating together made them happy. They really were... sad to say goodbye. I just never felt any of that. I never could. This is different. We're different. - What? - I... It was going to be surprised, but... [laughs] - I thought you hated pumpkin pie. - I mean, I do, but... you don't. Now get out of my kitchen. [Clark] Stay on target. Stay on target. Stay on target. Star Wars. It's classic. You ever seen it? Ever seen Star Wars? [screams] [all laugh] What? What the hell are you guys doing? 'Sup, Bean? We're deep frying the turkey. Oh, okay. What? What happened? When ice hits hot oil, it creates steam, which forces is the oil in the container to overflow. Oil is combustible, so when it hits your heating element, it... Turkey goes boom. - [boys] Oh! - [sarcastically] Oh! So, how do we fix it? You have to defrost it in water first. Grab those birds and come with me.

Come on, Will! You gotta catch the ball! You catch the ball and then you run! It's simple fucking math, man! Damn! God! Come on! Line up! And where the hell is Grizz? [Grizz] So, what you want to do is you want to grab the whole vegetable, not just the green part. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah. - So now, twist and pull. Oh, yeah. Nice. There you go. Wow. That's pretty cool. Thank you. Yes. Should we pull some more? I mean, we're missing dinner. Um, I don't know. I sort of like losing track of time. It happens a lot down here. If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need. It's, um... Cicero, I think. - Cicero? - Yeah. Very smart. Oh, thank you so much. [both laugh] So... do you? Do I what? Have all you need? Almost. Okay, so the final score is... Luke's Roman's, 36. Clark's Guards, 42! [crowd cheers] Whoo! Yeah! That's right! Everybody loves my big D! Thank you, Clark, for being such a gracious winner. I hope that you're all hungry because there's a big Thanksgiving dinner inside the church, thanks to Will. [crowd cheers] And all of you. First, though, something we've been waiting for for a long time, the Committee on Going Home has a report. [crowd applauds] Okay, so as you all know, we've been working hard to figure out four essential things: where we are, how he got here, why we're here, and how to get back. In terms of the first question, there have been two hypotheses on the table. This is Earth, and everything else is gone, or Earth exists, and we're someplace else. [crowd murmurs] [Gordie] So, I think today we have an answer. [Bean] If you remember, ten days after what happened, there was a solar eclipse. At the time, we told you it was a scheduled astronomical event, but after looking at some almanacs, we realized we were wrong. The next total solar eclipse in North America is not until 2024. So we've traveled forward in time? That's what I thought at first, but I don't think so now. Um, if you look up, you'll see Orion's Belt and the Big Dipper, all the things you're supposed to see in the sky over the Northern Hemisphere. But if you step up and take a peek in my old Celestron AstroMaster, you'll see the star, Betelgeuse. Except, Betelgeuse isn't where it's supposed to be. It's a few degrees off. And if you look closer, you'll notice that there are no moving objects between us and the moon, which means somehow all of our satellites have disappeared. What does that even mean? Well, I think it means that this Earth isn't our own. It's like a parallel universe. Almost exactly like ours, but not quite. Okay. I know that sounds... scary. But we all knew that the answer was going to be weird. Um... I kind of think... it's actually kind of hopeful. And how do you figure that? 'Cause if this isn't our Earth, then... it means that everything we love and miss is... still there. Our parents are still alive. They're just someplace else. And we have to figure out how to get back to them. And we will. I mean, if we went in one direction to get here, there's got to be a way to get back. Doors work both ways. I really feel like we've just been given some hope. It also means that... this place really is a new world. And that we really... as far as we know, are its first people. [giggles] And this is its first Thanksgiving, held in year one in our temporary home of New Ham. Which is now its official name. Okay, let's go eat. Okay. - [crowd cheers] - Yeah! There you go. Try the turkey. It's good! Yeah? It's a little dry. But hey, that's a Thanksgiving tradition in my family, so congrats on that. Look, if it's that bad, why don't we just... why don't we just start with dessert? - You sure? - Yeah. Go finish your movie. I'll clean up. That's a good idea. Wow. These look great. You're welcome. - Hey. - Hey. You want to hang out afterwards? It'll be midnight afterwards. That's okay by me if it's okay by you. It's our curfew. Everyone will probably either be drunk or knocked out on tryptophan. It's a good cover. Yeah. You know, you're right. Uh... - It's crazy to... - Let's do it. For real? [girl] Kelly. - I'll see you later. - Yeah. See you later, yeah. My ambrosia's gonna blow your mind. Will. Gordie, have you seen Sam? I was three, maybe four. I had meningitis. Meningitis? - Yeah. - Yeah. Wow. That's... You remember before then? Do you remember hearing at all? Some. I remember my mom's voice, the way she would sing to me and Campbell. My dad's laugh. Cool. When I dream, I still dream with sound. But not new sounds. And what would be a new sound? My voice. I remember my voice when I was a kid, but I'm guessing it's a little deeper now. I wish I could hear yours. Can you teach me... one more phrase in sign language? How do you say "kiss me"? [timer ticking] [Campbell] Elle? Yeah? [Campbell] What's taking so long? It just needs to cool. Just give it a minute. [timer rings] Hey. You scared me. Wow, that looks amazing. [inhales deeply] That smells amazing, too. I'm sorry if it tastes funny or something. I... haven't really done this Thanksgiving thing before. Do you want to just eat it in the kitchen? 'Cause... we can if you want to. What do you mean you've never done the whole Thanksgiving thing before? My family and I moved here from Ireland when I was four. It's not... It's not really our holiday. Right, but that was, like, a long time ago. You've never had a Thanksgiving dinner? Uh-uh. I guess Mom made, like, lamb stew and Guinness cake, but that's just 'cause she was homesick. Anyway, if you let me get into this drawer, unless you want to eat the pie with your hands, I need to get my pie cutter. We're joining the others. What? - What... - We're joining the others. Let's go. No, no, no. Wait. What are you doing? - I'm not being fair. - No, it's fine. You've never had a Thanksgiving before! Let's go show off the pie that you made. No, no. No, I had my heart set on it being just us, okay? We eat every meal, just us. I don't care. I want it to be you and me. Why're you making such a big deal? 'Cause I don't want to go. I really... I don't want to go. What the fuck, Elle? I'm giving you a gift. Why are you fighting me on this? I just... I don't want you to get mad. I don't. It's just like the movies, you know? You say yes, and then you say no. It's just... No, I... Hey, I... I want you to be happy. I want you to be happy. That's all. We've had such a good evening, me and you. Don't ruin it. Put your coat on now. [Allie] Are you guys having a great time? Yes! - I think we should eat now. - Okay. [Allie] Campbell. Elle. I didn't expect to see you two here. I'm here for Elle. This is the pie she made. Wow. Well, if you guys want to, um... There's a pair of chairs next to Gretchen. Gretchen? Thanks. - Campbell, let me just grab the pie. - What? The pie, I just need... What? What are you doing? I need to put it on the table. - Well, I can do that. - No, but I... No. I made it. Campbell, I made the pie. Hey, what's gotten into you? I just... I need to put the pie onto the table. Okay. There it is. It's safe and sound. I want to go home. - What? - I feel sick. - You feel fine. - No. It's just... It's in my stomach, Campbell. - It's 'cause you're hungry. - I'm not hungry. Can't wait to try some of that pie. This is gonna be fun. Let's eat.
