Now ask him if he wants a beverage. A what? A beverage. Do you want a beverage? A what? A beverage. Okay. Hey. what the hell is that about? The guy's a lefty. He couldn't have shot calvin. Is there something you wanna share? If speedy shot calvin from the passenger's seat, It would have been point-blank. He would have left powder residue on calvin's shirt, Which it did not have. Ddition, calvin had a through and through. Bullet ent his front, came out his back. I don't sehow a southpaw makes that shot. You're on the wrong track here. What? Ask him about the bruises. Ask him yourself. How did calvin get The marks and bruises on his face and neck? Terrence. Calvin's brother? They get into it sometimes. Terrence is a punk, man. The victim was an ox. The killer had to be a pretty strong guy to bring him down. No murder weapon? We've got divers searching the river. Stan was last seen during the first dance at 8:45. Fisherman spotted him at 9:03. So we're matching that window up against The digital time/date stamp from photos and videos, And we've narrowed it down To these suspects who were unaccounted for. 15 who could all be the killer? Or just camera-shy. Bring 'em in. Terrence randall gibbs-- Ganged up with the eastside royals, Assault, robbery, Two stints in prison. It's not a motive to kill his brother. But this might be. Calvin had a life insurance policy. He was a college student. What could that be worth? A lot. The payout was based On projected earnings if he went pro. Guess who the beneficiaries were. His mother and big brother terrence gibbs. Let's go get him. Hey, fitch, can I have a minute? There's a press conference today at 6:00. You're gonna be there. The chief approved your participation. "...Managed to pull an injured bystander to safety Even as he took aim on the perpetrator." You forgot the part where I walked through fire And caught a falling baby. It's close enough to the truth. It's a dog and pony show, counselor. I can't pretend to be some hero I'm not. You being a hero is better press than a first-day detective Getting shot in the station house. This is nuts, lieutenant. I'll expect you there. I'll get back to you on that. Cover the back. terrence. ♪ So you're already back at work, huh? Yeah. I can't afford to lose the job, you know? Look, you guys... You guys find out anything? We're still working on it. Can we ask you some questions? Yeah, yeah. Um, my break is in about ten minutes. No, terrence. We're gonna need you To come down to the station right now, okay? Why? We'll talk on the way. Wh-wh-what the hell is ts, man? We just wanna ask you some questions. No, man. A-are you serious? Look, no, I'm done with you, man. Terrence-- Man, don't touch me! hands behind your back, terrence. Hands behind your back. Get off of me! You're wasting time, man! all right.. I don't believe this! You're wasting time! I don't believe this, man! Get off me! You're wasting time! Wait! I didn't kill my brother! So how long you been working at that greasy spoon? Six months. Mm. You like it there? It pays the bills. What about calvin? I mean, didn't he help pay the bills? That wasn't his job. His job was to keep running, catching, And striving for greatness. That's all I ever wanted for him. Mm, because of how you screwed it up for yourself, right? Two years all-state cornerback, Followed by a string of minors, Running with the royals, Then four years hard time in jackson prison For felony assault and robbery. Man, what is this? "this is your life, terrence gibbs"? I hope it's not your life, man. Look, I straightened up my life years ago, all right? Now if you're so good at research, look that up. I've been clean as a virgin since '05. This is going nowhere. Give stone a little room. Room we got, time we don't. I'll go check that number he gave us again, See if his alibi checks out. You know, it was pretty go, terrence, I mean, the way you showed up at the scene the other n, All--all worked up like that. It was very convincing. But you see, I'm not mucof a drama fan. I'm not buying it. I think you killed your brother. Why would I do that? Life insurance... On calvin. You were named a beneficiary. He--he must have taken it out, man, though. That's the kind of kid he was. You know, he, um, Always more worried about us than anything. Then why have you been smacking him around? I wanted him to stay away from trouble, And I wanted him to stay out of that club that they all went to, And I wanted him to stay away From that thug who owns it-- goat. Whenever me and calvin fought, man, it was always 'cause I wanted to keep him on the straight path, man. Tough love? Where I'm from, there ain't no other kind. I talked to his sponsor. He was at a meeting, got a chip. Okay, do you know the last time that calvin was at that club? Yeah. Last night. looks like a kielbasa convention in here. All right, uh... "fran.. Csi...Zek... Woj.. Cie.. Chowski"? maybe "francsizek woj-chai-chowski"? I don't know about these suspects, But their names are murder. "maciewicz..." "pete karmazemek." "frank si..." frank. "f. Maniskiewicz." Really? okay, so your relationship with the groom Was less than cordial then? Cordial? We were at a family picnic, with kids. I grabbed the last beer, And he sucker punched me across the jaw. I haven't eaten steak in a month. He used to hit on my wife all the time. He sold me bad real estate deal. He hit on my daughter, broke my little girl's heart. He kicked my dog. My dog. Stan was a real son of a bitch. Everybody knew it. Real assbag. I'm s--I'm sorry. What? Assbag. Dupa! You couldn't trust him. Do me a favor-- When you find the guy who killed stan, thank him for me. So we've narrowed it down to seven. None confessed, but they all had opportunity and motive. It seems like everyone who met him had a motive. Who would want to marry this guy anyway? Ah, he conned her into it. It's the whole marriage game. Please don't get him started. Which is exactly why I'm gonna keep picking up Girls with tramp stamps at the blackjack table And not have to worry about anything meaningful. You guys talking about my love life again? See? See? Back me up, doctor. Monogamy is just an untenable construct That's in direct conflict With our species' biological imperative. Why can't they all be as unromantic as you? I'm still waiting on some tests back, But initial findings are in on your dead bridegroom. Toxicology's back. Blood alcohol was .15%. Drunk at a wedding. What a shocker. Also, found trace amounts* He had sex last night? Not necessarily But it's possible he was overly stimulated. So a woman could have killed him. Sure. Time tlook for some ladies. ♪ better ask somebody ♪ ♪ ♪ better ask somebody ♪ ♪ ♪ better ask somebody ♪ sorry, folks.. Invitation only. Well, we're looking for goat. Well, you found him.

He declined. I was disappointed. I told him if he didn't want to do business with me, Then maybe he shouldn't be in my club. So he left. What kind of business? Sports apparel. Sports apparel? Yeah, I love them tracksuits. Nothing to do with drugs or pharmaceuticals? I'm a legitimate businessman. Yeah, right. I-I've heard about you.

If he was gonna take calvin out, he'd get it done right. This thing was sloppy. It was personal, not professional. Speedy shot back. Maybe goat wn't counting on a gunfight. No, this was someone who was angry, Someone impulsive, someone who was maybe following him. Look, goat had motive and opportunity. What else do we need? How about proof? Is this how it's gonna be?
