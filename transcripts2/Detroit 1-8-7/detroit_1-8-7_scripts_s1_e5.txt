As soon as we know anything, you'll know something. Let the police do their job. Girl's kandace monroe. She's only 15 years old. I was so worried about you. You didn't answer your phone. I'm okay. Kandace monroe, age 15. Superintendent found the body About 20 minutes after the late bell. Blunt force trauma to the left temporal lobe. Most likely from this. It's rebar. won't hold any prints. The surface won't hold any ridge detail. We'll send it to serology in case there's d.N.A. looks like claw marks on her neck. Maybe she got a piece of the perp under her nails. I'll have her hands bagged. So... Guy grabs her, tries to have his way. She fights back, he panics, And he hits her to keep her quiet. Sexual assault? We'll know after the autopsy. Go on over. I'm fine. Well, maybe she isn't. We got it. Did you know her? Not really. oh! let's go. You're coming back to the station. Well, you need to do your job. It's fine. I am doing my job. dove sono I bagni? Where are the toilets? Dove sono I bagni? Where are the toilets? Dove sono I bagni? How much longer do I have to listen to that? Eight and a half months. Would you like a glass of wine? Vorrebe un bicchiere di vino? Would you like a glass of wine? You're really funny. You think you're gonna retire to tuscany And dazzle 'em with your sparkling sense of humor? I'm gonna try. Two to the chest. Guy delivering produce next door--he saw the back wide open. Came to check it out, found him laid out like this. Rigor mortis. He's been here a few hours, at least. Wallet's missin'. We searched around for it. So... no sign of forced entry. Is there any report of an alarm going off? No. No. So he didn't break in. Probably an employee. Closing up after work, back door's unlocked. Shooter slips in to rob the joint. Pow. Grabs his wallet and runs. .40 caliber. What is going on here? Pl. Please. This is my restaurant. excuse me. You the owner? Yes. Oh, my god. How did this happen? You know this young man? No. You sure? Yes. Okay. Make sure he stays close. so we don't know who he is, How he got here, or who killed him. It's a hat trick. Text your sister and tell her you're okay. You know how fast rumors start. Can I just go home? No. I don't want you to be there by yourself, And I have work to do. What happened at school today-- I know you're upset... I'm not. Even if you don't want to talk about it. I told you. Kandace and I weren't friends. Still, it's a traumatic thing. I hardly knew her. Simone, you don't have to know someone to feel bad about it. It's called empathy. So... How long do you think school is gonna be out? Not long enough for you not to do homework. Interview room. Go study. And don't think I didn't notice that makeup on your face. We'll discuss that later. One of kandace's b.F.F.S over there said that she saw her Talking to a construction worker across the street this morning. Yeah, we should go see if she can I.D. Him. All right. Excuse me. Homicide. Detective washington. Can we talk? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Hey! ♪ stay down. you're under arrest. ♪ ♪ So milbank security's The only company patrolling in and around greektown? Uh, correct. Uh, drove my usual route. It was pretty quiet all night. Nothing unusual happened. Yeah, Except for the unidentified dead man in the restaurant. Except for that. Right, yeah. Sorry. I meant from my point of view. Okay. Thanks for your help, mr. Remus. Okay. Now according to the milbank security guard, The alarm never went off. No, they are mistaken. Every night that alarm is set, either by me or my daughter. Every night. Excuse me. Do these belong to either of you-- Pillow, blanket, condom, and a bible? Then it looks like you had an overnight guest. May explain why the alarm wasn't on. Do your employees know the code? A few that we trust. You have a gun? Oh, yes. We keep a gun here. Three robberies on this block in two months. believe me, we know what you mean. What's wrong? The gun. It's gone. .40 caliber. Sync by Rafael UPD ReSync for 720p CTU by Alex1969 www.addic7ed.com What do you got? The gun missing from the restaurant's a .40 cal-- Same as the one used to kill our victim. So if that's the murder weapon, whoever used it Probably knew the restaurant, knew where it was kept. Disgruntled employee looking for payback? They probably went in to rob the place. It went sideways somehow. Doesn't explain who our vic was, though. His prints aren't in the database. So we ran the plates Of all the vehicles within a 2-block radius. The results just came in. Percy edmondson. There's our john doe. Any relation To the defense attorney leon edmondson? His son. His father's a bit of a blowhard, right? With a very high acquittal rate. Yeah, we bust 'em, he gets 'em off. That attitude--it's not gonna get in the way now, will it? The man just lost his son. I think I can table my feelings for a death notification. All right. Let's get to it. Ci che dio vuole lo far . What god wills, I will. Ci che dio vuole lo far . honestly, honestly... 24/7. I swear. 24/7. Stone's got the construction worker in the box. Peter afton. Registered sex offender. Looks like kandace might've been hanging out with the wrong guy. If he was gonna hurt her, he saw her at the site. Why wait to go after her near campus? Too many witness where he was? So you think one of the guys across the street Killed kandace? We don't know. Mm, like he raped her and then hit her in the head? Where did you come up with all that? I... Read it in a tweet. Eyewitness says you were talking to kandace monroe this morning Before school. Yeah, she comes around sometimes. Kind of a flirt, Likes to show off to her friends that she can work older guys. Is she okay? So I take it she didn't know you were a registered sex offender. Did she say I did something? 'cause if she did, that's a lie. Statutory rape in 2007, huh? The girl and I were dating. I was a senior. She was a freshman. It was consensual. Consensual? Law says different. She was the one came after me. Just like kandace, right? No, not just like kandace. All we ever did was talk. Well, she's not talking anymore. You know why? Because she was murdered this morning. Were you at work all morning? Wait. You... You got scratches all over your neck. I got these at the site, Which is where I was until you guys picked me up. But you should be looking for that guy I used to see her making out with behind the dumpsters. Dude was all over her. You seem to know a lot about her extracurricular activities. Kinda hard not to notice. She wasn't exactly shy about parading it around. She was slutty. But I don't wanna talk trash about a dead girl. Of course not. You all are concerned more about the crime than about justice. That's all I'm seeking for my client. It's my job is to make sure that he gets his day in court With the best possible representation. After that, it's up to the jury. Can't help it if most times they see it my way, right? this is a slam dunk for you? Mr. Edmondson, what's next? give us a statement there. How could this have happened? We think he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. You know, we're not exactly sure yet what happened Or why percy was at the athens taverna restaurant. Does that mean something to you? This girl he was dating used to work there. I thought it was over between them. Zoe... zoe... Something. I only met her a couple of times. Yeah. Yeah, I have it here. Zoe fremont. Laid off three months ago. Supposedly she moved out of town. They don't call me the prince of prints for nothin'. Bam! Left-hand corner. 1 corinthians, chapter 13. Print belongs to one zoe fremont. And the real miracle is, she has a record. May be our girl. You never got back to me on that double date thing I suggested. Yeah, I did. I told you I had to find someone who'll go out with you first. Whoever owned this bible was studying it very seriously. Last known address was near wayne state, But that was over a year ago. No point in going there first. Let's take a visit to The holy trinity redeemer church. Why? You wanna pray for a better lead? So what can I do my prayefor you gentlemen? We speak to the man in charge? That would be me. Unless you mean god, in which case, uh, he's unavailable. my name's reverend james boon. How are you? Ah. How you doing? So zoe fremont--she's a parishioner of this church? Zoe's a good girl. I'm sure this is all a misunderstanding. "all" what? What are they doing here? What are they doing here? I told you not to call the cops! They just showed up. We just wanna ask you a couple of questions About your boyfriend, percy edmondson. zoe! Wh-what are you doing?! Put that gun down! Zoe. Zoe. Take your finger off the trigger, zoe. I'm not talking to any cops! Zoe, I need you to put down your weapon. We just wanna ask you a couple of questions. Go ahead. I'm afraid we're gonna have to do that down at the station. But if you didn't do anything, it won't take long. I didn't shoot percy! Then we can talk about who did. What are you doin'? What are you doin'? "doth not behave itself unseemly, Seeketh not her own..." Please leave me alone! "thinketh no evil." say it with me, zoe. Say it with me. "rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth..." "in the truth." "in the truth," yes. yes. "rejoiceth in the truth." Corinthians I... Chapter 13. it's okay. It's okay, zoe. It's okay. Afton's alibi checks out. He was on the worksite the entire time. Let's still have ward check the tissue Under kandace's fingernails against afton's d.N.A. Okay. And what about this boyfriend afton mentioned? Girls at school claim kandace didn't even have A serious boyfriend, so... Yeah, teachers, parents, they all say the same-- She was really into her studies. Which definitely tells me she was secretly seeing someone. Someone her parents didn't approve of. why hide it at school? maybe her friends wouldn't approve either. Makes it more dangerous. Could ask simone. Maybe she heard rumors. Look, she didn't really know her, And I don't nt to push. You have results for us? Your vic wasn't raped, but she was pregnant. Pregnant? Four months. Well, get to work finding the baby's daddy. Boys in ballistics Still have a few tricks up their sleeve. While your gun was the same caliber As the one used to kill percy, It's not the same gun. I told you I didn't shoot him! Then what's with all this drama? We can't help you if you don't help us. Okay? Where you there last night? I've been sleeping there sometimes, Just until I can find a place to stay. My key still works, And the alarm code's still the same. I sneak in after-hours. Why didn't you just stay with percy? I was too embarrassed to tell him I had nowhere to go, So I pretended I still worked there. He came to pick me up, And I talked him into hanging out... So we could spend some time alone. We fell asleep, And about 3:00 a.M., we heard a noise up front. I knew the petroses Kept a gun under the counter... So I grabbed it. And then that... It's okay, zoe. You're safe here. We saw him! he was just standing there. He started shooting, and I froze. I saw percy go down, and I ran. I thought he'd come after me. You saw the intruder? Not his face, but how he was dressed. His uniform. So, zoe, you're saying That the shooter was wearing a uniform? Yeah. He was a cop. We dumped kandace's cell phone. She contacted a women's health clinic a week ago. Stone and washington are checking her computer, See if there's any names. Go to the clinic. Maybe kandace didn't go there alone. thanks. Thanks. It's weird how simone was asking so many questions earlier. 13-year-old's morbid curiosity. A cop's daughter's pointed questioning. It's more than that. We should clock it. You, uh... Did... Did you do something to your hair? I changed it a bit. Yeah, I can see that. All right. Who's driving? Do you remember seeing this young lady in here A few days ago? Looks a little familiar. We get lots like that. Well, we're only interested in this one. Her name is kandace monroe. She and her boyfriend came in, Both scared out of their minds. We told 'em there was a 24consent law, Meaning they had to review all the materials for a day Before an appointment could be made. O over so well. What happened? They got into a big fight. We had to ask them to leave. Do you remember the boyfriend's name? I definitely can't give you that. Look, we have a dead, pregnant 15-year-old, And the baby's father is a definite person of interest. Anything that you can do to help would really be appreciated. I'm not allowed to give out that kind of information. It could cost me my job. We have a very strict confidentiality policy here. You have a good day. Thank you. Lance brown, 15 years old. Zoe fremont is the last person to see my son alive, And she's not a suspect? We think she was actually a witness. She says it might've been a cop who shot percy. A cop? Do you know any who may have had a vendetta against you? I know I'm not aorite of the police department, but-- That's probably an understatement. Look, I do my job, detective. I defend my clients to the utmost of my ability, And I don't make excuses for that. It's never personal. Okay. Okay, well, look, That--that's good to know, okay? There was this drug bust case that I had last month. I accused a cop of lying under oath. He ended up getting demoted. I got some threatening e-mails from him. Did you report this? I had this strange idea That I might not get much support from d.P.D. Were these e-mails threatening enough to go after your family? You be the judge. "you will pay for what you did to me and my family. What goes around comes around." It might not have been personal for you, counselor... But it sure sounds personal to him. I don't deny it. I hate that son of a bitch. He ruined my life. Did you send those e-mails? Ten years on the job, And this assbag concocts some kind of crap About me falsifying a report. Like that, I'm back patrolling the streets And overseeing community programs. So where were you At approximately 3:00 this morning? I was answering a home invasion outside of greektown. And I got a partner, a report, And a guy in holding to back me up. All right. We got any more questions, You mind coming down to the station? I have no problem. I got nothin' to hide. You call, I'll be there with a union rep. All right. Thanks, man. Give johnnie cochran a message for me. Tell him if I was gonna kill anybody, I'd go after him, not his son. Hmm. I believe him. Kandace monroe was not the perfect girl Her teachers made her out to be. oh, yeah? Facebook page, chat rooms-- they're all vicious. Looks like anybody she didn't like was a target. "I can ruin your life. No one likes you, loser." She really had it out for this "losergirl." That the baby daddy? He and kandace got in a fight a couple days ago at the clinic. Why is lance here? We have to ask him a few questions. Lance? He couldn't kill anybody. He couldn't kill anybody. Simone, you should get back to your algebra Before your mom gets back. Holland checks out. There was a home invasion on the 1500 block of warren ave. An arrest was made. Yeah, the c.A.D. Also lists another home invasion On jefferson, near the renaissance center. Alarm went off. D.P.D. And milbank security answered the call. And? And you know that milbank security guard I talked to this morning-- remus? Yeah. He said nothing unusual happened last night. Patrolled the same area. Zoe said it was a cop. Security guard, cop-- At night, it could all look the same. Yeah. I think we should have another chat with mr. Remus. so you're telling me you didn't know kandace monroe? Uh, I've seen her around school a couple times. That's about it. That's about it. Hmm. I was under the impression You knew her a little better than that. Nah, you got me mixed up with someone else. My son told you, he doesn't know this girl. Now can we go already? So that wasn't you arguing with her at the clinic the other day? That wasn't you. Somebody get their memory back? What's he talking about, lance? Here's that file you wanted. Thank you. We need to call a lawyer, dad. Well, you do that, you only make it harder on yourself. Look, I only found out a couple days ago That she was pregnant, and then she says she wants an abortion. You got a girl pregnant, and you didn't come to me? You should go back to studying. I am sorry. Wait. Wait, wait. I was just trying to do the right thing. How? By crushing her skull? No. I wasn't even at school this morning. I was out looking for a job. How about a lifetime position at the license plate factory? Her being pregnant got you looking at Double homicide, lance. Hey, he said he didn't kill anybody. Simone, you shouldn't be watching this. But lance didn't kill kandace. He couldn't hurt anybody. Look, she wouldn't even text me back after we left the clinic. Did that make you mad? Well, what do you think? That's what we call motive. No, stop twisting my words around, all right? Stop talking. She wanted the abortion, not me. Stop talking, lance. I think you wanted the abortion. She wouldn't do it. No. No. You got mad. You got into a fight. She stormed off, And then you confronted her at school. No! No! That's not what happened. No? Hey, this conversation's over. Now, we want a lawyer, and we want a lawyer now. That's fine. Whatever you like, mr. Brown. Lance didn't do it. I swear. You got somethin' to tell us? no. No. Forget it. Forget I said anything, all right? Your daughter's impeding an investigation. I've already talked to her. Talk to her again. She said she doesn't know anythg. She's lying. She knows a lot more than she's saying. With all due respect, We've got to look into every lead. My daughter is not a lead. Lance brown's not our perp. He was looking for a job at the time of the murder. You confirmed this? The only thing he's guilty of is knocking up our victim. What do you think she knows? Nothing. I already told you, okay? Simone. What? Just because I don't think lance killed kandace Means I know who did. You have any idea who it could be? Are you asking me as a lieutenant or my mom? Both. You know what kids call me at school? Narc. Or "here comes the snitch-bitch." No one wants me at their parties because They think if they pull out a beer or something, I'm gonna run home and tell mommy. I know it doesn't mean much now, But in the long run, none of this is gonna matter. Most of these kids you won't even see after high school. But you know what's gonna stick with you? What you did when you had the chance To do the right thing. It's okay if you don't tell me, but tell somebody. I didn't raise you to be afraid. This morning, you told me nothing unusual Happened on your shift last night. That's correct. Yeah. See, that's strange, 'cause we know that a milbank security guard, Along with d.P.D., responded to a home invasion At 1023 traylor street. Now traylor happens to be on your patrol, But for some reason, the responding officer tells us That the security guard was not you. In fact, none of your stops remember seeing you at all. Now you tell me if I'm wrong, 'cause english is my second language, but... Doesn't that seem unusual to you? So if you weren't on your patrol, where were you? Perhaps breaking into the athens taverna restaurant? No. You had access to the alarm codes. No, that wasn't me. You had plenty of time to shoot and kill that 21-year-old kid. No. I didn't work last night, okay? I traded with another guy. Oh, that's... Pretty darn convenient. It's not a lie. He paid me 100 bucks. Well, why didn't you just tell us that this morning? I was scared I'd get fired. We're not supposed to switch shifts. But lying to the police-- they're cool with that. Who'd you switch with? Dennis lyons! Police! Open up! get him out. Aah! Careful. Door's hot, door's hot, door's hot. Gah! got him? Uhh! Help. going through the stop sign... right. First he was going.. no, I understand. I see this green... ...Handle the investigation. Um, I'm going to need to take as much information From the families as I possibly can. Have you seen simone? Not since earlier. She's not answering her phone. Where the hell is your partner? Can anybody tell me anything? Positive l.O.C. First and second degree burns. Pulse was weak and thready. Bed 3. That man's a suspect in a homicide. he car went up like that? He had about ten gas cans in the trunk. Arson? Yeah. I'm amara petros. I got a call they were bringing my boyfriend in. They told me to come here. Amara. Simone's still not answering. Well, I tried some of the friends' numbers That you gave me, but no one's heard from her. Try 'em again. What about Fitch? Still not picking up. Next message, tell him he doesn't answer his phone, He'll be working midnights in central district. Uh, losergirl, talkalot-- I checked the I.P. Addresses. They're all fake handle names. Kandace used them to spread rumors about other girls -She didn't like. -Of course. So no one could trace it back to her. Hey, partner. Yeah. Is that fitch? Let me talk to him. I don't understand any of this. They said he was running from the police, And then their car burst into flames? He was actually running from us, miss petros. Did he do something wrong? We got a warrant. Had detectives search your house. We found the gun that killed percy. The ballistics matched. That's not possible. I told you. I never saw that boy before. We don't think he was part of the plan. Plan? What plan? Plan you and dennis had-- Burn down the restaurant, collect the insurance money. That's ridiculous. Amara, dennis had gas cans in his car. That's why it went up in flames. Did dennis have a key to the restaurant on his key ring? Right. I know how hard times can affect people. But... A young man is dead. I never planned to burn down my father's restaurant. Somebody did. We checked with milbank security, And there's no record of you setting an alarm last night. Of course I set it. Not according to "open and close logging" Which you signed up for a few years back. It's possible I forgot. I-I don't know. I must have. There was a lot going on. Or could be you didn't set it on purpose. No. Mr. Petros would never do that. He knows that there's been A rash of burglaries in his area. He'd make sure to protect his restaurant. His daughter. Of course. What was I thinking? I'm very protective of my daughters, too, mr. Petros. They live miles away, But I still call them every once in a while, Worry about 'em like they were 7. Make sure they're taken care of. It's natural. But the insurance money Would have gone a long way towards taking care of yours. Two things you didn't count on... Zoe and percy. You might be able to lie to us. There's one person I don't think you can lie to. Papa? Papa? Papa. Where is she? Inside. Inside where? This is the home of laila stevens, 15-year-old honor student, math tutor. Doesn't sound like a killer. No, but she is someone who has been viciously bullied. So you're saying kandace was killed in retaliation. Kandace confronted laila in the parking lot. Tired of being kandace's punching bag, Laila picked up the rebar and hit her. Terrible. This is all because kandace thought Something was going on between lance and leila. Turns out leila was only tutoring him. Okay. Just follow me. So when did you figure it out? I got a freaked-out text from laila While I was doing my homework. Why didn't you say somethin'? Laila asked me to walk to school with her this morning. And I blew her off. I just got tired of being the target, too. I guess... I feel guilty, Like I caused it or something. It's not your fault. You had no idea this wasonna happen. I feel so bad. I just feel so bad, mommy.
