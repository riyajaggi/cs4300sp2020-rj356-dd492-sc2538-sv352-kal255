 Little Dorrit (2008): Season 1, Episode 1 - Episode #1.1 - full transcript 
 London; the 1820s. Amy Dorrit was born in the Marshalsea, a debtors' prison, where her father has been incarcerated for so long he dines out on the fact,regarding himself as a local celebrity. She has just got a job as a seamstress to Mrs. Clennam, a widowed invalid and a ruthless businesswoman who lives in a crumbling town house with her sinister butler Flintwinch and his nervous wife Affery. Arthur Clennam, her son, is returning home after nine years working for the family firm in China. In France he meets a solitary Englishwoman Miss Wade and the retired couple, Mr. and Mrs. Meagles, who have gone abroad to take their spoilt daughter Pet's mind off the unsuitable boyfriend Henry Gowan. They also have an adopted daughter Tattycoram, whom they patronize, and Miss Wade is drawn to her as a kindred spirit. On his return to London Arthur cannot understand why his usually uncharitable mother has engaged Amy and recalls his father's dying words to 'put it right'. He assumes that his family is responsible for the Dorrits' misfortunes and visits Amy's father at the Marshalsea to the annoyance of the jailer's son John Chivery, who worships Amy. Locked in the prison overnight Arthur meets Amy's irresponsible brother 'Tip', another debtor, and Amy's sister Fanny and uncle who are music-hall artists who are visiting. Meanwhile, in France, Rigaud, a murderous French man, and his timid cell-mate, the Italian Cavaletto, are separately released from jail. And Miss Wade surprises Tattycoram, who is in a rage at her adopted parents, by calling on her.At night Affery is taken aback to see Flintwinch, who has just burnt some papers at his mistress's request, entertaining his twin brother.

 - Out of the way! - Oh! Yes? What? Amy Dorrit, sir, to see Mrs Clennam. Ah. Yes. You'd better come in. Thank you, sir. Would I be speaking to Mr Clennam? No, you would not. You're very small, ain't you? Yes, sir. I am strong. Are you now? You look a shrimpy little thing to me. Well, she's upstairs. This way. It's a bit dark, Sir. She likes it dark, and I'm used to it. Not afraid of the dark, I hope? - No, sir. - Good girl. - Not afraid of me either, I hope? - No, sir. Well, you ought to be, cos I'm a terror when I'm roused. Here we are. Come. Here she is. You won't want me. No, you can go. - Amy Dorrit. - Yes, ma'am. Come closer. Why, you're a child! I'm 21, Mrs Clennam. I know I am small, but I am quite grown up. Are you? Mr Casby tells me you are looking for employment. Yes, ma'am. I've brought some samples of my work, ma'am. Good. This is good neat work. Well, Miss Dorrit, I'm prepared to take you on approval. General duties. 3 days a week, from 8 in the morning till 6 in the evening, 7 and 6 a week with all found. You may start this very day. Will that suit? Yes, ma'am, very well, ma'am, thank you... You'll find it quiet here. There's only myself and Flintwinch and his wife. My husband and son... My husband and son are abroad. Arthur... Put it right. Put it right... Put it right... Put it right. Well, Mr Clennam! Not long left of our deuced confinement! What a fate! To be quarantined in Marseilles, of all places! - And for what? - For no very good reason... Except we've travelled from the East, and the East is the country of the plague, so they think. The East? You call Venice the East? Do they? Mr Clennam has been in China, Papa. He's been away for 15 years, I'm sure he can put up with a few more hours delay. Besides, I've enjoying the company here. Oh, the company! Well, excellent company, to be sure! Thank you, Mr Clennam... We've enjoyed these days together, haven't we, Tattycoram? Yes, Miss. It's getting so hot! Tatty, would you carry my shawl for me? I hate you. All of you, hate you, hate you with your kindness and your charity and your pretty faces and your baby names, like I was a toy or a doll... Papa, shall we join Mamma downstairs? No, no you go ahead, Pet, I'll follow on. - ? bientot, Mr Clennam! - A presto, Miss Meagles. You have a very lovely daughter, Mr Meagles. Yes, yes, I do. And Mrs Meagles and I are very glad you think so, Mr Clennam, very glad indeed. There you are. Why are you always following me? Go away! You don't care for me! Oh, but I do... Harriet. They're waiting for you. I won't come. I'll run away. Or I'll curl up and die here. No, you won't. You'll be patient, and bear it all. I thought they took me in to be part of their family but, they treat me like dirt. Like I was nothing! Well, of course they do. I was like you once. No... Go away. I'm frightened of you. And why is that? You see right through me... you see all my badness. You make me worse, you make me say things I don't mean... I... I don't hate them. They're good and kind, and I'm a wicked thankless creature. Have it your own way. Here is my address. If ever you want to come to me... you may. - Thank you Mr Flintwinch. - 8 o'clock tomorrow, then. Hold on. Where do we send to if we need to get word to you? Care of Mr Plornish, Bleeding Heart Yard, if you please, Mr Flintwinch. Good day. Didn't care to divulge her address. Nor would you, I dare say, if you lived in a debtor's prison, Flintwinch. Plenty of people in debtors' prisons. Some of them even deserve to be there. God has brought this child to my door. I cannot avert my eyes. Our boat is here. We're free at last. And you're bound for London, Mr Clennam? Yes. Some necessary business to settle first. And then? And then, I'm going to start my life all over again. Well, now! Oh, at last Tatty! You can help me with these boxes. Miss Wade, can I offer you any assistance in your arrangements? I'm obliged to you, but I prefer to go my own way and in my own manner. Well, goodbye Miss Wade! I suppose we may never meet again. In our course through life we will meet the people who are coming to meet us, Mr Meagles. They may be coming thousands of miles over the sea; they may be close at hand now; they may be coming, for all you know, from the vilest sweepings of this very town. Goodbye. Sacrebleu! What a hell hole this place is! And I a gentleman, born to command. - Sens'altro, signore. - Sens'altro signore. Imbecile. What a fate! To be locked up with a petty smuggler and I, a distinguished... murderer. Altro, signore. Altro. Altro, signore! I could murder you, here and now. What do you say, hmm? Two for the price of one, hmm? Little Cavalletto. You think I killed my wife for her money? I would have killed her for nothing! But can they prove it? I think not! I have laid out a little money, here and there... # Qu'est-qui passe ici si tard, # Compagnons de la marjolaine... # Qu'est-ce qui passe... # ici si tard... # gai, gai, toujours gai! # Thank you, Mr Chivery. Ah, all well Miss Amy? Very well, thank you John. I got the job with that Mrs Clennams. But, please, not to tell father. Whatever you say, Amy. Well, I'll... Ah! Ah... I looked in on your father, Amy. He... he was fretting a bit, asking where you were. I... I told him, you'd be along very soon, and that calmed him. Thank you, John, that's very kind of you. I better go to him. Oh, Pa! I know, son. I know. Father? - It's Amy. - Amy... Where have you been? You know I don't like to be left. But you've been well looked after, Father. Mr Chivery and John look after you. Yes, I suppose. But it isn't satisfactory. They have others to look after besides me. What if I were to choke or have a fit, sink down in a swoon with no-one by? And, you know... I don't always feel they afford me the respect that is due to me. I am sure they do, Father. I am the Father of the Marshalsea, you know? An honorary title, to be sure, but I fancy it carries a certain weight, a certain gravitas. Only this morning, while you were out, a very well-connected gentleman who was visiting the establishment, upon hearing of me asked to be introduced to the Father of the Marshalsea. I thought that was very considerate of him. Very considerate, very civil. Where did you go? I went to call upon a lady, Father. - Just a social call? - Yes, Father, just a social call. You weren't able to leave a card. She didn't ask for one, Father. It didn't arise, it wasn't necessary. She understood you were a lady? She understood that my daughter is a lady, the daughter of a gentleman, - as good a lady as any other lady? - Yes, Father, I'm sure she did. Father, I am to go to her 3 days a week. - But not to work! - No. I think she needs companionship, Father. I need companionship!! Of course you do, Father, but Mr Chivery is here, and John, and you have so many visitors. I never see Fanny, I never see Edward, and now I am never to see you! It is only 3 days a week, Father. It is necessary. Yes. Yes. I understand. Now, what shall I get you for your supper? Oh, Amy. I have brought disgrace upon us all. No, you haven't, Father. We all love you and we are all very proud of you, and everyone here looks up to you. But it is not as it was meant to be. You have known nothing else but if you had known me as I was before I came here, as I was before you were born... I love you as you are. Arthur... Your mother, Arthur. Put it right. Your mother, Arthur. Your mother... - Chops to your satisfaction, sir? - Yes, thank you. Anything further, sir? Plum pudding, glass of port, claret? - Nothing else. - Clear the table, sir? - Am I incommoding you? - Not at all, sir. Pleasure to serve you, sir. Stay as long as you like. I've been putting off going somewhere I don't particularly want to go, you see. And, er, where might that be, sir, if you don't mind me asking, sir? - Home. - Right you are, sir. Leave you till tomorrow, sir? Care to inspect a bedroom, sir? No. Yes. Chaymaid! Gentleman at table number 7 wishes to see a room! Stay! I've changed my mind, I'll go home. Chaymaid! Gentleman at table number 7 not going to sleep here. Going home! Oh! Oh, Lord, save us! - Flintwinch. You haven't changed. - Arthur? Mr Arthur. Well, I suppose you'd better come in. You'd better let me go first. Shock of seeing you after all these years could kill her. Arthur? Well, come here. This is unexpected. - Mother, what's happened to you? - As you see, I have lost the use of my limbs. I have not been outside these doors for... Tell him for how long. A dozen year next Christmas. Mother, I am afraid I've come back in unhappy circumstances. - Is the business in trouble? - No. No. May we speak in private? Mother, I must ask you to prepare yourself. Father passed away some three months ago, an apoplexy. He didn't suffer long. You need not have come half way round the world to tell me that you could have written. I needed to see you. I wanted to give you this. Father was most insistent that I put it in your hand myself. - Mother, what does it mean? - Nothing. It means nothing. Affery?! Mr Arthur is retiring. Affery will show you to your room. Mother, you can't dismiss me. There are things I need to know. Not this evening. Come to me tomorrow at ten. Don't kiss me. Only touch my hand. Goodnight. And here we are! Home sweet home! And not a finer place to be found in the whole country than dear old Twickenham! Eh, Tattycoram? So come on, down we get! And down we get, Mrs Meagles! Down we get, Pet! - Ah, and here's Poyner. - Welcome home, sir! And how do we look to you, Poyner? Oh, very well, sir, and very welcome too! Be careful up there! If you please, sir, Mr Gowan called, not half an hour ago, asking after Miss Pet, sir. Mr Gowan. I see, yes. Did he leave any message? Only that he'd call again tomorrow morning, sir. Very well, then. Let's go in. Mrs Meagles. - Poyner, what did Mr Gowan say? - Well, what did you expect, Meagles? 3 months abroad would cure her passion for him? Not hers, but his. I thought a scoundrel like that would have less patience. Meagles! Mr Gowan isn't a scoundrel, he's a gentleman! Same thing, often enough. Come along. She was never strong. I should never have... Too late now. Father? I wasn't asleep, you know? Just musing upon happier times. Happier times. - Hello, Pa! Hello, Amy. - Tip! Call him Edward, Amy. That's his proper name. How are you, my boy? Oh, not so bad, Pa, not so bad. Thought I'd look in on you. Very good of you, Edward, to think of your old father. Amy's always coming and going these days. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of staying a while. Glad to hear it, my boy. - What's the matter, Tip? - Nothing's the matter. Not exactly. Have you lost that job at the law stationers? That one? I didn't like it there, Amy. I got tired of it, so I cut it. Got another place in the fruit trade. Cut that. Then I got another job in the horse dealing line. I did like that, but it didn't like me. So here I am again, like the bad penny. Oh, Tip, don't say that you're a prisoner. Well, I don't want to say it, but what am I supposed to do? - I'm in for forty pound odd. - Forty pounds! Looking on the bright side, at least I know the ropes. Don't worry about me, Amy. A little rest'll do me good! I shall do very well here. - Tip! - What? Whatever you do, don't let father know. Eyes down! Eat the food the good Lord provided and be thankful. And remember, he is here in this very room and knows every wicked thought you think you keep hidden in your heart. - Do you hear me, Arthur? - Yes, Mother. Yes, Mother. Do you know, I believe you are no better than your father. Look me in the eyes, Arthur! Yes. You are a vessel of sin, I believe, just like your father was and still is. And you will bring me nothing but shame and disappointment, just as he has. There we are, Arthur. I brought you a nice cup of tea. Oh, thank you, Affery. He's down there with her. Them two clever ones, putting their heads together. She wants you to go down to her at ten, not before. I can't tell you how glad I am to see you back in your own bed, Arthur. I wish I could say the same, Affery, but it is very good to see you again. So you... you are Mrs Flintwinch now? - I am. - How did that come about? Well, I hardly know myself, Arthur. Them two clever ones arranged it all between them, I believe. He never courted me, you know. "Affery," he said, "What do you think of the name Flintwinch?" "What do I think?," I said. "Yes," he said, "Because you're gonna take it. You and me must be married." "So if you put your bonnet on tomorrow morning at eight, we'll get it over." He'd had the banns read and everything. And she was all for it, Lord knows why. So what could I say when it had got to that? If it had been... if it had been a smothering instead of a wedding, I don't think I could have said anything against it, - not against them two clever ones. - And are you happy, Affery? Happy? What's happy got to do with it? - Affery! - There's Jeremiah on the stairs! - Where are you hiding? - I'm here! - I'm here, Jeremiah. -I shan't ask you again! Oh, Lord... Ah, there you are, Amy. Punctual as usual! And how are you today? Very well, thank you, Mrs Clennam. And yourself? I endure what I must, Amy. I don't complain. Come here and sit by me. - Arthur's waiting. - Let him wait. He may come up at ten o'clock, as arranged. I hope your father is well, my dear. He's quite well, thank you, Mrs Clennam. Arthur... Your mother, Arthur. Put it right. She'll see you now. Here he is. All right, Jeremiah. I shan't need you. - Well? - I've made up my mind to leave the business, Mother. I've given almost half my life to it so far. I felt that I owed you and my father that much. And now... I consider that I have discharged my debt. I felt like a prisoner. Now I claim my freedom. Have you finished, Arthur, or have you anything further to say? Er... there is something else. What I have said concerned myself. - This concerns us all. - "Us all?" - "Us all?" Who are "us all?" - Yourself, - myself, my dead father. - Well? The watch... it meant something but I don't know what. Father died without telling me what it meant, but over and over and over before he died he pressed it into my hand saying, "Your mother. "Your mother, Arthur. "Put it right." You oversaw all his dealings. What did he mean, Mother? - What have we done? - How dare you! Did it ever occur to you that he might have had any secret remembrance that caused him remorse? Our family business was always driving hard bargains, and grasping at money. Might it be possible that he... he wronged someone and made no reparation for it? Flintwinch! Flintwinch! Come here immediately! If we have wronged someone and reparation can be made, let us know it and make it. Let me make it. What? You're hammer and tongs already, are you? I thought as much. What's the matter? My son, Flintwinch, has seen fit to lay aspersions and accusations on his own father. Oh, dear. That's not dutiful, Mr Arthur. This is none of your business, Flintwinch. Oh, ain't it? But I say it is. Has young Arthur told you what he means to do about the business? He has relinquished it! Thereby giving me the pleasure of advancing an old and faithful servant. Jeremiah, the captain has deserted the ship. You and I will sink or float with it. Excellent, ma'am. I thank you with all my heart. Right, time for your oysters! You may leave us. You have no further business here. - Goodbye, Mother. - Only touch my hand. Now go. Ah, Amy. Good girl. Don't be shy, come closer. Thank you, Amy. What do you still do here? You are not wanted! Oh, Arthur! You gave me a start! Tell me, Affery, who is that young girl that I saw upstairs? Little Dorrit? Oh, she's nothing. She's a whim of hers, just an object of her charity, that's all. My mother was never given to charity before. Is she a connection of ours? Do we know her family? Have you taken a fancy to her? You must have had your pick of girls out there, across the China Sea. There were one or two, Affery. Oh, here you are, Amy. Sit down and eat it. Keep your strength up. - Do you remember your old sweetheart? - Yes, I do, very well. And I remember how we were separated. Well, she's a widow now, and well to do, and if you'd like to have her, you can, so there! You're a man of the world now, Arthur, you could have your pick of any girl you wanted. Ah! Home, sweet home! Nothing to beat it! What do you say, Tattycoram? Nothing at all, Mr Meagles. Nothing at all! But you feel as I do. I know you do, I know it! You think you do, but in truth you know nothing at all. Fiddlesticks! Bother! Oh, what's the matter, my dear? Only that I've left my umbrella upstairs. Oh, well, never mind, dear, Tattycoram'll fetch it for you and happy to do so, aren't you, Tattycoram? I'll fetch it if you wish, but I don't know what makes you think I'm happy to fetch and carry and look after you all when no-one will fetch and carry and look after me! Temper, temper! Count to five and twenty, Tattycoram! I can't! It's too late! I'm beyond myself! Tattycoram! Best let her go, Meagles. She'll come to herself by and by. Yes, mustn't worry. Oh, well played, Pet! I can't bear it, I can't, I can't! Oh, Lord what's the matter with me, why am I such a wicked girl? - Good afternoon, Harriet. - What... What are you doing here? I was on my way to see you. You didn't write. I was worried about you. No. No, I won't talk to you. - I mustn't! - Oh, but I think you will, Harriet. I think you must. And so the day of reckoning! Rigaud is to face the full majesty of the court. And I shall triumph, I believe. Their witnesses will melt away, their evidence will crumble into dust. Sens'altro, signore, sens'altro. - Monsieur Rigaud. - Ah, Monsieur le Jailer. The President of the Court has decided there is not enough evidence to convict you and you are free to go, but there is a crowd out there, - and they don't love you. - Rabble! I despise them. I suggest you get as far away from here as you can. - Monsieur Rigaud, time to go! - Cavalletto... You and I will meet again one day, I believe. And what will I do with you then? Huh? Eat you, perhaps. - Altro, altro. - Altro. Altro. Lead on, monsieur le jailer! # Qu'est-ce qui passe ici si tard, compagnons de la marjolaine # Qu'est-ce qui passe ici si tard? # Gai, gai, gai... # # Qu'est-ce qui passe ici si tard... # Curse on this poxy weather! Rigaud is down for now, never mind. Rigaud will rise again. Monsieur! Monsieur, arr?t! Pour le nom de dieu! Salaud! Cochon! May your nethers rot off in strips! Attends! J'arrive! J'arrive, Monsieur! Merci! Allez! - Hello, John. - Miss Amy... - I picked up a little something. - Thank you, John. I should go up now. - Good evening. - Oh, good evening. I... I wonder, could you... could you tell me, what place is this? - This place? Well, it's the Marshalsea. - The debtors' prison? That's it, sir, yes. Yes, the debtors' prison. I... I beg your pardon. Can anyone go in there? Oh, yes, yes. Anyone may go in, sir. It's not everyone who may go out. May I walk in with you? I should count it an honour, sir. Thank you, Mr Chivery. Frederick. Er, just... do you know anyone that lives here by the name of Dorrit? - My name is Dorrit. Frederick Dorrit. - Do you live here? Not as an inmate, never as an... er... as an inmate. My brother William Dorrit is in residence here. Ah, I beg your pardon, I had no idea. Let me explain. I have recently come back from a long absence overseas. I have seen a young woman who works at my mother's house, Mrs Clennam in the City. This young woman I know only as Little Dorrit. I saw her come in at these gates not five minutes ago. The young woman whom you saw is my brother's child. Ah. I should like to know more about her, and to help her, if I can. Help her, sir? Does not your mother help her? Oh, I assure you sir, I have no ignoble designs upon her. Well, if you wish, you may come with me. Thank you. Very kind of young John. A very handsome consideration, delicately expressed. I hope you showed him proper thanks, Amy. William, this gentleman is Mr Clennam, son of Mrs Clennam, Amy's... friend. He wishes to pay his respects. Mr Clennam, you do me honour, sir. Frederick, my chair. Pray, pray sit down, Mr Clennam. You are welcome to the Marshalsea. Yes, I've welcomed many fine gentlemen here. Perhaps you're aware - my daughter may have mentioned it - that I am known as The Father of the Marshalsea. An honorary title, to be sure, but one that gives me much gratification. - Father! - You know, I dare say, - that my daughter Amy was born here? - No. No, I did not, sir. - Some might think that a disgrace. - No, indeed. She's a good girl, sir, a dear girl. Amy, put the dish down. Would you do me the honour, sir, of sharing my humble repast? No... Not a morsel. I have dined. My elder daughter Fanny, does not live with me, but with my bro... What have you done with Fanny, Frederick? Erm... believe she's out walking with Tip. Edward! Edward! Have the goodness to use the correct nomenclature. My son Edward, Mr Clennam, he's a little wild, but he's a good lad at heart. - Your first visit here, sir? - Yes, my very first, Mr Dorrit. I wonder, could I ask you, before your arrival here, did you have any business with the House of Clennam? Clennam? No, you, sir, are the first Clennam it's been my pleasure to meet. Though I've welcomed many fine gentlemen here. Amy, what was the name of the gentleman from Camberwell - who was here last Sunday? - I can't recall, Father. Oh, of course you can, of course you can. The one who performed that handsome action with so much delicacy. Oh, tush! His name has quite escaped me. But, as I was saying Mr Clennam, a handsome and delicate action, you might like to know what it was. Yes, yes, indeed. You, you, you must know, Mr Clennam, that it does sometimes occur to a gentlemen, er... who come here, to offer some small... testimonial to the Father of the Marshalsea. Sometimes it takes one shape, and sometimes another, but it's generally... Money. - I see. - Now, the gentleman from Camberwell, made a gesture of peculiar delicacy... He brought a bunch of geraniums; gardens not being accessible to me, a bunch of geraniums, which, upon closer inspection, was found to contain a twist of paper, with two guineas inside! A handsome and delicate action... - I was never more pleased. - Father, please stop. - Mr Clennam doesn't want to hear this. - Oh, nonsense Amy. Mr Clennam and I understand one other perfectly, - I believe. - I should say so. What does she want now? Her and her blasted stick... Downstairs there's a wooden box containing legal documents and other papers. You know the one I mean. - I do. - Bring them to me. I want to see them destroyed, Flintwinch. Destroyed, not hidden. Understood. It's imperative that my son should never see them. Understood. Understood and all in hand. Good. And he was a very distinguished gentleman, and was kind enough to leave a little testimonial, which he managed with - great delicacy. - I'm sure he did. Er... do you happen to know where Miss Dorrit has gone? I'd like a word with her before I leave. She should be here! She's away far too much. And as for my other children... Ah my dears! I was just speaking of you. Mr Clennam, may I present my elder daughter Fanny, and my son Edward. The bell, ah yes, that's a signal for visitors to, er... retire. Fanny's come to say goodbye. Don't be alarmed, there's plenty of time, plenty of time before the gate is locked. How do you do, Miss Dorrit, Mr Dorrit? Charmed, I'm sure. I only came to get my clean dress from Amy, father. - Where is she gone? - Here I am, here's your dress, Fanny. - It's mended and made up? - Yes. - How about my waistcoat? - Good girl. Come, Fanny, come now, it's nearly time for the lock! All right, Uncle... Bye, Pa! Make haste, Mr Clennam. 'Less you want to spend the night here. I'll be with you directly. Mr Dorrit, would you allow me... Mr Clennam, I'm... I'm deeply, - deeply moved. - Please, Mr Dorrit, say no more. You must come and visit us again. Amy, show our friend the way. All visitors time to leave. All out, please all out. - There's the gate. Good evening, sir. - Forgive me... - May we have a few words? - Why did you follow me, sir? I could not speak to you in private at my mother's house. You've seen how it is between her and me. But I should like to ask you about my mother's reasons for employing you. I believe your mother employed me on merit. The bell will stop and you'll be locked in. You must go. - May I speak with you again, Amy? - Yes, I suppose so. How can I stop you? I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude. Good evening. Oh, I say? Could you open the gate? I was delayed. Can't be done, sir, more than me life's worth. You're here for the night now. Good God. Caught you, have they, Mr Clennam? You'll have to be sharper than that next time. Er... surely you're locked in too. Why, so I am! But not in your way. I belong to the shop, only, er... the guvnor's not supposed to know about it. Can I get any shelter here? Well. If you don't mind paying, they'll make you up a bed in the snuggery. It ain't as snug as it sounds, mind. Not like home. I'm sure it'll serve well enough for one night. Come along then, Mr Clennam. I'll see you all right. - Thank you. - This way, Mr Clennam. This way. There, all gone. Thank you, Flintwinch. Jeremiah? All clear. Jeremiah? Sit down. What about that glass you said I could have? Here. Drink it, choke yourself. Mrs Clennam's port wine. Very nice, her health. Your health, his health and all friends round St Paul's. Where's the box? All here, Jeremiah. - Heavy enough. - Take care. Guard it with your life. Affery! What are you about, you silly old woman? You've been getting out of bed in your sleep! Dreaming! You slip back up to bed. And if you ever have such a dream again, it's a sign you're in want of physic! And I'll give you such a dose, old woman... Such a dose! Now, off with you! All clear. You guard it with your life, Ephraim. Yes, Jeremiah, safe with me.
