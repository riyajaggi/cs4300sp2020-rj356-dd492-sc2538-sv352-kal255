 Killer Wave (2007–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - Episode #1.2 - full transcript 
 With the stakes raised, McAdams is on the run. His greatest fear becomes a reality when he discovers the identity of the terrorist hiding in the shadows--a master manipulator with ties to McAdams's own past, empowered with undersea nuclear missiles, and set to detonate another full-scale assault.

 The Department of Emergency has managed to restore power and water to several municipalities along the Southern Shore, but residents are critical of Washington's slow response to the tsunami, claiming that humanitarian organizations and local businesses have been quicker to respond. The Red Cross is advising all New Jersey residents to boil tap water before drinking it and to keep the use of electrical appliances to a minimum. There's a system descending from Canada.

 Will this affect us? Actually, it'll act in our favor, extra cover. We'll detonate closer to land this time. But will it still hit where we planned? Yes, and the wave will be bigger as we discussed. Now get out of my chair! It's just that we... We need to do it now. We need to send the message and be done. The message will be delivered, my friend. Don't worry about that. Hello. Mel, it's me. Just the man I wanted to talk to. I think congratulations are in order.

 Did you figure it out? Yeah, but this one was hard. Tell me what you found. It was tough. I had to use pretty much everything I knew, well, not everything, but... Mel... Mel... can you skip the explanations and just tell me what you figured out? But the explanation's the best part. Anyways... The encryption is another map. Another map of what? I don't have a clue. Some kind of coastline or something. Anyways, I printed it out. How do I get it to you? I can't get there right now. Um... Can you fax it to me? Sure let me get a pen. Shoot. Okay, it's 5-5-5... 5-5-5-0-1-9-6. And, Mel, I need it now, not in 20 minutes, okay. Bye, John. Thanks, Mel. Another map, another target. Did she say anything about the news? I don't think she watches TV. Can you get that fax? Almost hit that guy. You believe that? Boy. On the highway? It's true. What kind of driving is that, anyway? It's this way, gentlemen. We appreciate you seeing us. Well, I'm glad you called. I mean this whole situation today, it's mind-boggling. And now you're saying Sophie has become involved somehow. Do you have any more information? No, no, we haven't heard from either of them. Well is he holding her against her will? Do you know? Well, we understand they were close friends. In a roundabout way, I guess. She was close with his fiancée during Sea Lion. Was she part of Sea Lion? No, Ann was. We'd like to know more about that project. Certainly. I've... I've put together some background for you. Really? The murder implicates me because my fingerprints were on the murder weapon. But the police arrived immediately, it's too fast. Somebody would have to call ahead of time. What's happening to Stanley Schiff right now? What's happening to Jack Wilcord? Here it is. Let me see this. I looked at it, but I can't... I can't recognize the place, can you? This is... this is here. What do you mean here? This is the Maine coastline, right here. We're along... Right there, that's where I live. Okay, we have to go. We have to warn somebody about this. No, we've got everything, it's okay. Yeah. Police have received calls from several unnamed terrorist organizations claiming responsibility for the recent New Jersey tsunami. But according to police sources, scientist John McAdams is still wanted for questioning in relation to what now looks like it might have been a deliberate attack. The woman with McAdams is Anne Bannister, his fiancée. Sophie's best friend. There's a photo in there of Stanley Schiff. He was part of it. I was too briefly, but not when those photographs were taken. Anne was the daughter of Victor Bannister, the Camtrell CEO. Yeah, she died in a sailing accident. It was in the papers. Well, Project Sea Lion wasn't exactly public. No, it wouldn't. This is a photo of the island off the coast of Alaska. That's where the tests were run. John McAdams was in charge of the entire project. He was a truly remarkable scientist. Was or is? Well, his mind seems to have turned. It's unfortunate. What exactly is Project Sea Lion? Sea Lion was an attempt to use undersea explosions to create massive waves. Waves large enough to take out entire cities. Jesus. Unfortunately, the sea was not as predictable as we had hoped. Our test proved our technology, but it also proved our flaw. How's that? There's a photograph in there. There are two groups. One on the platform, another in the control tower. The wave was supposed to hit about a hundred miles to the north, but it didn't. It hit the platform. And that's how Anne Bannister died. And McAdams was... In the control tower. That's tough to take. Yeah, and he didn't take it well. That's Mr. Bannister. His wife is now quite ill. They were devastated, of course. As you can see, Sophie is very, very close to the family. She and Ann were inseparable and had been for years. Where's McAdams? He was asked not to attend. Why? I've always admired John for his brilliance. He has the ability to... construct the most incredibly elaborate models in his mind, but... after Ann died, he... He attacked everybody. Talent like that can be very, very dangerous. So you think he might be delusional. He might be. But Sea Lion is not a delusion. That is the information that I have. I don't know when! If I knew, I'd tell you, okay? But I do know that a wave, a giant wave, is going to hit the Maine coast just in the Quinimac area. Quinimac. Can you spell that? And you need to inform people and get them the hell out of there! I don't know when. Just listen to me for a minute. A wave just hits New Jersey and... and you'd think you'd want to tell people about this! Stop being so obtuse! Idiot! So... I've gotta go to my place. No, we're not going back there. My neighbor and I share the same Jeep, so she has no way of getting out of there. John, there's a tidal wave coming we can't go... You want me to take... You want me to drive you back to the motel? Okay. Thank you. Let me ask you something. Yeah? What's your take on what's going on? Well, my honest opinion, and this is speculation, is that John found somebody, or somebody found John... and they're using this technology against the United States. That's strong words. You have anything that might prove that? No, no, I'm... I suspect that John would have some kind of record. I... I mean, if that's even the case. Excuse me. Clark. When? All right, play it for me. No, I want to hear it now! Yeah. No, that's him. Yeah, you better start an evacuation right now. We're on our way. Evacuation? What? The cops received a recorded voice of McAdams saying a new wave is going to hit the coast of Maine, but they don't know where. My God. Yeah, you better take care of your people. Where to? McAdams' place. Okay. John, not too fast. We have to get there. Yeah, we have to get there, so slow down a little bit. How could anyone even think about doing this? We did, didn't we? I created this thing. I know how it works. Those waves are getting bigger, and they're just going to keep getting bigger. Heinz said it comes from inside the country. Yeah. It's a huge operation. Huge. This is where technology gets you. And framing you. But who in the country would even have the idea... "A," who benefits from this? "B," whose got that kind of money to build this kind of thing? Follow the money. What's that? Jeez! Pull over. All right, whatever you do, just let me do the talking, okay? Hi. Hi. Hi, Officer. Can I see your license and registration, please? Sure, sure.Yeah. I... I think it's in the glove compartment. What's the... what seems to be the... the problem? You're going a little too fast, sir. Really? How fast were we going? 30 miles over the speed limit. Wow. Sorry about that. Um... Sir, we didn't mean to... No, listen, we're just on our honeymoon. Yeah. We're kinda excited about that, and... Very excited about it.Yeah. Maybe you can, I don't know, just give us a break. Listen, I'll be right back. We have a code 10-1. Okay. Okay, so what do we do if this is your name? I don't know. You don't have anything here. All cars, please proceed immediately to Route 95, closest intersection. Over. Just... Okay, we'll just leave then. Okay. The evacuation is based on what authorities are calling reliable information that a tidal wave could hit the Maine shore. No one is giving a specific time, only that it could be imminent, and this is feeding the sense of fear that we see here played out in the images on Maine's Route Six. Excuse me. Now, on the plus side... Sorry, I was just... Just want to pay for gas. It's 33.78. Yeah. Out of 40. Crazy Are you going to leave? I don't know. My husband thinks we should, but we're a mile inland. I mean, how bad can it get? You should go. Yeah? Well, maybe we will. Six and 22 back. John McAdams, wanted for questioning in the murder of biologist Heinz Lichtner, is now being described as a "person of interest" in connection with what authorities are calling possible terrorist involvement in the recent tidal wave in New Jersey. We have footage of Dr. McAdams with a female companion at the market where Dr. Lichtner was killed yesterday. And here he is accompanied by a woman police have identified as Sophie Marleau... Hey! Hold on. Are you... What's going on? You're a terrorist now and so am I... Go! Now, you cannot see, but for ten miles down this country lane, traffic has come to a complete standstill. Up this road, around the corner again, traffic, complete standstill. It's quite surreal to see this as anyone tries to make their way from the wrath of Mother Nature. Now, as I look around me, I don't feel any sense of fear, of any sense of panic, I should say. But rather I can sense a palpable sense of fear as everyone tries to make their way away from this impending disaster. Will my love ones be safe? Will my home be there when I get there? These all questions that everyone in these cars is asking themselves right now. This Eric Adjuk for CRN. Here you go, guys. Thank you. What are you doing? I'm turning around. We have to get to that cottage. Yeah, get killed? No. That's our job. Our job is about surveillance. Now this guy's a terrorist. There's a wave coming in... No. I don't think he's working alone. That he's even guilty. Now there's information down there that we need... Aw, you saw what happened in New Jersey! It's a tidal wave. Why're we going down there? Right. Get out of the car. I'm going. For what? Cause of Jersey, 'cause I want it to stop. And I want to know what the hell is going on. You gotta go, go. All right. You're going, I'm going. Um... Legal should be handling that. Give that to Terry, would you please. Anything else? CRN requested an interview again. And the Financial Press called. Depends on what they want to talk about. As always. See what you can find out. I will. Olivia McPhee? She hasn't called back yet. That'll do. Thank you. Mr. Powell! Victor... I think... you can be pretty pleased with yourself. You will be remembered as the man who saved Camtrell. That'll be the end of it. So far, so good. Um, there are certain things, if they happen, we have to plan for. But, if other things happen, there only so many "ifs" you can plan for. But those are contingencies, and we don't really have to talk about that. What other plans? You look... a little squeamish. I can understand that. We're all very upset with the images in the media. It's disturbing. Um, but I think we have to keep in mind, Victor, that if they weren't focusing on this, they'd be focusing on something else. So... why don't you go away for a while? You could fly off somewhere, fly back after the event, deliver your speech... which we will write for you. Edgar, I'm used to handling the reins. I know that. But, we got a whole new team now. The horses are out of the gate, over the first few hurdles. Got a few hurdles left, and, once we get over those, we'll get to the end and we'll have won. Or we'll lose. Olivia McPhee hasn't called back. No, she hasn't. But she will. You know, it's Washington, and you know Washington. It's, basically a collection of lab rats. They react to stimuli, and right now we're providing the stimulus. How long? Until they commit. And when they commit, you'll have won. You'll have won back your corporation. You'll have financial security. People will be working, happy. And my shares, which I think you remember, are my sole form of compensation, will rise in value. Things will be good. Courage, Victor. It's the last mile. And the last mile is the hardest mile, Because at the end of the day, it's the longest mile. Ha! You told me that. And evacuation is in effect from Bar Harbor, Maine, to Quinimac. Residents are urged to leave their homes immediately. If you require assistance, call 911 or your local police station. Car-pooling is strongly advised. Route 95 is slow, but moving. Fuel stations are operating at full capacity. Okay, I'm going to try something. ...visitors to the Quinimac area are to report to checkpoints eastbound and southbound along route 95 and the Arlington Maine Expressway. This is the Emergency Broadcasting Network on 89.9 FM and 1040 AM. Okay, where is this going? Do you know? Yeah, I think I know. I think I know where I'm going. These are back access roads. Okay. Leading in many different directions. Yeesh. Sorry about your car. It's okay. I'm leaving now. Is there anything you need? No, you have a good evening. You know, you should go home too. I've got things to do, Sarah. Are you all right? I mean, I can stay if you need me. You're very kind. Very kind, Sarah. Well... good night, Victor. Good night. All right. There's the boat. You wanna cast off the back? Yeah, I'm taking care of it. You in? Yeah. Let's not waste any time in here, man. All right. Just get in, whatever you find, disks, maps, I don't know, he's got... He left something behind. Okay, go! Go! Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay... Hey, Marlon, found his records. January, February... Just take it, Frank. Charts, maps... Take everything. Hey. Hey! What do you men think you're doing here? Where's John? Who are you?! F.B.I., we're looking for him. Yeah? You got any I.D.? John, he hasn't done anything. None of your business, ma'am. You got a warrant? Under the circumstances, we don't have time. What circumstances? The tidal wave. The tsunami that's coming. Haven't you heard? No. I don't watch TV. There's always an agenda. You need to get out now. I can't get out of here. John and I share a jeep and he's got it. Okay, you're coming with us. Frank, grab these. Come on, Mar, let's go. No, take these! Wait, wait, wait! You hear that? What? No birds. Marlon, come on let's go! We've gotta go! Don't touch me. Come on, let's go! You leave those books alone! We gotta get outta here! Or I'll testify that you entered here without a warrant! Marlon, come on! Coming! Annabelle! McAdams! What the hell are you doing here? Looking for you. Yeah, I'm looking for my neighbor. Get out of my way. Annabelle? Yeah. She's in the car. What, you're going through my stuff here? Yeah, yeah. We're doing our job. What's wrong with you people? I'm being set up! I'm not the guy you're after! Yeah, well, who's setting you up? Who's giving you orders? That's the question! If you're innocent, come with us and prove it! No! What the hell is that? Wow. That's the wave, we've got to get out of here. John! John, the tide is going out! We've gotta go now, come on. Yeah. Go, go, go. The safest place is by sea. No, no, no. Get in the car. Get in the boat. The safest place right now is in the ocean! No, we're going up in the car! All right, drive! Just get in the car. Get in the damn car! Go! Go now! What was that? What's going... Go! Go! Just drive! Drive, Frank. Drive, drive, drive! See that? Look at that! Wow! Does this goddamn road ever turn inland? Up ahead, just a ways. What's "just a ways"? I don't know! Hang on! Does this goddamn road ever turn inland? Up ahead, just a ways. What's just a ways?! I don't know! Hang on! Come on, come on, c'mon, c'mon... Go, Frank! Wow! Clark? Brisick? Son of a bitch! Holy... I hope you can swim. Brace yourselves! All right, get down! Get down! Another killer wave has hit America. A section of the Maine coast has been devastated from Quinimac up to Bar Harbor. Trees lie broken, houses smashed, roads flooded. And low land areas lie swamped under water. The sea, which only a short time ago was a devastating force of destruction now lies eerily calm. Docks have been reduced to piles of splintered wood while their defeated boats sit broken on the rising hills behind. These are communities that have been shattered. The Red Cross is setting up camps all along the Maine shore. Near Quinimac, the hardest hit area, Camtrell's CEO Victor Bannister will hold a press conference today to announce his company's strategy for clean-up and re-building. It's the coast guard. Where's it going do you think? I don't know. Probably... to a Red Cross center. All right. Easy does it. Where do I go? Hey, man, beats me. It's my first day on the job. Great. Hey! I'm gonna walk around a bit, check things out. See ya later, Frank. Yeah, yeah. Looks like you guys went through hell. Yeah, I don't wanna go through that again. No kidding. I mean, look at this. This could take years to clean this up. That's the one thing you gotta say about Camtrell. Something like this happens, we always come through. It doesn't matter what it costs, let's just get the job done. I mean, they say Bannister takes it out of his own pocket if he has to. Really? That's what they say. Those boys in Washington, they've got other plans. He's not on the up and up or something. He's just a good guy. He won't play their game. That's what it is. But to them, they investigate. Investigate what? He's just a good guy. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Well, you're doing a good job. Keep it up. You too, pal. Take care. Georgie! Hold up! I'm coming with that. Frank... Yeah... That's good. Man. It's yours. There ya go. Nice hairdo. I called head office, told them what happened. So, where's McAdams? He, um, got on the boat. He rode into the wave. You okay? Yeah, I got a headache. That's too bad. Well... Listen, if you created a wave that would take out half of Maine's coastline, would you hang around to save a neighbor? Yeah. As the entire population of the east coast is beginning to live in fear of another massive wave destroying their communities, residents of Maine are trying to come to grips today with the devastating news that some of their loved ones may be among the victims of this unpredictable force of nature. But the very fact that this is the third tsunami to hit the Atlantic coast in such a short period of time has left officials and members of the scientific community baffled as to the cause. However, unconfirmed reports suggest that terrorist angles are being investigated. We detonated closer to land this time. The risk is greater, but we gain so much control. It's the answer. I knew it would be. Well, my goodness. Now, isn't that something? Congratulations, Stanley. Thank you. How was the response? Well, the... the warning went out. John? Yeah, well, he... he pieced it together. That's also as you predicted he would. Yeah, I'm just glad it's over. Yeah. I hate to do that to him. I know. Well, look at it as a small sacrifice. And in the end... maybe it'll help his books sales. Um, my friend? Now, why don't you get some sleep? You deserve it. I should, I... Yeah. I should try, you're right. You did a good job. Tell me as soon as I can eliminate that man. You'll get your chance. Right now, we need him. Now, this next part is gonna be a little delicate. Um, so far, up to this point, Mr. Bannister and Mr. Schiff, they've been fairly easy to manipulate, but now they're gonna need to be pushed. Why do we need them? We made the waves. Okay, I want you to picture this. In Washington at this moment, we got a lot of people running around, looking for a solution. But in my experience, we're not gonna get the appropriations that we need unless they're desperate. So? So. Another wave. Another wave. But this time, bigger, much bigger. Excuse me. And, the, the warheads will arrive tonight. I'll see to them. Um, Aslan, um, I got a report from the F.B.I. who were tailing John, and they... they tell me that he was in his house in Shandy Harbor, when the wave hit. Now... either he's dead... or he needs to be. Please, could I get some help over here? John! You're okay! Mel! Are you okay? Hey! John, there's a police guy just behind you. Yeah. John, I saw you on the news. If there's anything I can do, let me know, okay? Thank you. Thank you, Mel. I have to go and see... Yeah, sure. ...if I can find Annabelle. My van's over here... John, can you believe it? I know, yeah. Everyone's cars are ruined, and my old thing, indestructible! I'll meet you here in a little bit, okay? Okay. Mr. Bannister. Hi. Thank you for coming. You want to take care of that for me, please? Thank you. This is really awful. Can I help you? Yes, I'm looking for a friend of mine. Annabelle Gibbons. G-I-B-B-O-N-S. Gibbons, Annabelle. She's in bed 23B. Just over there. Just right here. Okay, thank you. Right here? Yes. Well, good morning, all of you. It's nice to see you all. I'm sorry we have to get together under these... very trying circumstances. Excuse me? Is she gonna be okay? She's stable. That's as far as we can take it with anyone right now. Annabelle? I know you can hear me. You know that character in the book? It was all you. You're inspiring. Annabelle. Hi, John. Hi. Just rest. It's okay. It's okay. I knew I was the heroine of your story. Shh, shh, shh. Just... sleep. Now I understand that there's a possibility that the assault on these shores may be the work of terrorists. But whatever the cause, I want to make sure that you understand... I want to stress that we do not know that cause. But we certainly know the results, don't we? Destruction and devastation on a massive scale. We will rebuild. But first, we have to recognize that we were completely defenseless today so that we won't be tomorrow. Do you have a concrete proposal for building defenses? Yes, I do, sir, I believe that it's time that we build what science calls a sea wall which is a series of channels and breakwaters that, somewhat buffer the effects of not only tidal waves, whatever the cause may be, but also rising sea levels. So, you have a headache? Comes and goes. Any dizziness? Thanks. I'm going to look around here. Here and there. Have a good day. After the headaches? As good as it can be. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. We're gonna move on... sir? Thank you, darling. Mr. Bannister? Trucking division, Boston. I knew you'd come, sir. I told them, they didn't believe me. Thank you, Ted. We can use your leadership, sir. Yes, sir. Well, keep on truckin'. Sorry about that, sir. We're doing everything we can to make everyone as comfortable as possible. I see that. I think a few words from you would serve greatly to reassure everyone. Excuse me. John? Where's Sophie? Mr. Bannister? Good luck with Sea Wall. Is everything all right, sir? Yes. We gotta go. Why? They know I'm here. We gotta go. We need a car, John. Can you sell us your minivan? No, you can't drive. Okay, guys, get in the back. I can get you out of here. Okay, yeah, that's a good idea. Could I get a doctor over here? You have a minor concussion. You need to rest and stay here for observation. Okay. Where'd you get this? One of the soldiers gave it to me. He's here somewhere. Thanks, doc. Have you seen this man? No. Why you leavin'? I'm going somewhere else. I have family I can go to, and... I thought I'd leave the donuts for the people who needed them. All right. Go ahead. Thank you. Nice uniform. That was so awesome! Did you hear me back there? I mean, I was so nervous. Stop. And then the guy... he was looking in the van and... Mel. Yeah? Mel. You have to stop now. Okay. There we go. Why? That's a good girl. You did good. Where are we going? No, no... we're going nowhere. Come on. End of the road. Give me a hug. Thank you. You're welcome. Thanks! Good luck! Bye... thank you very much. Okay. It's hard to start. If... I could drive you to your next... No, he can do it. Here we go. Thank you, Mel. I owe you. Thanks. Okay, let's recap. He was here, Frank. McAdams was here. The National Guard's after him. Well, I guess vacation's over. You have to get some sleep. I know just the place. Where? Just straight ahead. Victor Bannister was at the camp. He made a speech. He's going to build a sea wall. Straight this way? Yeah, you'll have to turn in a couple of miles. Stanley. Yeah, please, sit down. So, did you, get some rest? Some, it's just a little hard to sleep. Thinking about.. I can well imagine. Stanley, this... is a good thing we're doing here. I know. Now, it's very important. I want you to make sure you dismiss everything the media says. That's what I keep telling myself. Good. It's just that... I'm just glad it's done. Yeah... well, that's why I wanted to see you. We need to create another wave. No! Yes. No! No! Stanley, listen. It's inevitable. If you wanna push through this sea wall thing of yours... that's what you want, isn't it? Well, yes, but you said two waves. I know. You said one in New Jersey and one in Maine. I know. I know! You said that that would be enough! Stanley! This is just the beginning. The Camtrell Corporation has been applauded by the government and the business community for its remarkable relief efforts in New Jersey and now in Maine, especially in light of the ongoing Senate investigation into the company's business practices. Now, in other news, a flood of donations and volunteers pouring in from across the country, especially San Francisco, New Orleans, and Miami, cities that understand all too well the terrible effects of this type of disaster. If there is any silver lining to this story, Bob, it's that Americans are coming together to help out neighbors and even strangers, proof of what makes this country so great. Next up, the Quinimac miracle dog, and a sailor's heartbreak. CRN live coverage. Voila! Sorry. I'll just turn everything on, okay? Okay. Just a second. Here we go. It's nice. So you come here to paint? Yeah. And do sculptures. Yeah, to paint, to think, to get away. Working at the Institute can get pretty stressful. Yeah, I remember that. So... who's the headhunter? Me. What do you think? Well... a man's touch. You wanna talk about him? About the moose or the guy? We could start with the moose if you want. Naw, it's been over for both for quite a while. You want to drink something? Red? Red, perfect. Hey, you wanna toss me the keys? Thank you. Edgar. Our cargo has arrived. You remember the bar when we, we would all go there and drink and... talk about how we'd solve all the problems of the world? Everything seemed so possible back then. We were going to change that world. you wanna change the world, then the world changes you. You haven't changed much. I changed. I died. Something in me. Seven years ago next month. Cheers. You should stop blaming yourself for that. Who should I blame? I created it. How many people worked on Sea Lion? 40? 50? We all created it. Yeah, we all made the same mistakes at the same time, we... No! I made the mistake. I created that thing. I was ambitious, I didn't... I didn't check the data thoroughly enough. I wanted to do the tests straightaway. And now... that thing... everything it's doing and everything it's going to do... You know what, John? When it happened, I did like everybody else, I blamed you, too. Because I lost Ann, and I thought I could never replace her. But then I went to the Institute. I studied Sea Lion. I talked to Stanley Schiff, to Jack. And I know it wasn't your fault. I know what happened. Hah! You're not responsible for this. No. You don't know. You never created a weapon. You created something that would help people. John... whoever is doing this, John, they are the one responsible for it. You're not. Just relax. It's over now. John. Yeah... I know, I know. I'm just a scientist. I... Yeah, but... I understand the nature... Stop it! Stop! ...of reality, it's... Shh-shh.... just sub-atomic particles rearranging theirselves. Death is nothing. But you feel things, you know, so... it isn't intellectual...
