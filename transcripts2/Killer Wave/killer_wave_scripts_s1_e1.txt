 Killer Wave (2007–…): Season 1, Episode 1 - Episode #1.1 - full transcript 
 The scientist and novelist John McAdams is summoned to an emergency meeting of scientists at the Preston Point Institute to discuss a tsunami that has hit the Southern New Jersey Shore. Eight years ago, John created man-made tidal waves with his Sea Lion Project; during the experiments, his beloved wife Ann had died and he quit working as scientist. Now the scientists discuss the possibility of a terrorist attack. When John returns home, he finds that someone has planted a file in his computer with classified information to incriminate him since he had written a sci-fi novel about terrorists using tidal waves to destroy the USA. When a second tsunami reaches the Maine, John becomes the prime suspect and is chased by the FBI and the police. Meanwhile he investigates the events with his former colleague and friend Sophie Marleau and when he follows the money, he discloses a huge conspiracy with economical interests of the Camtrell Corporation to construct the Sea Wall defense system to protect the American coast.

 They're like, I gotta be original. These guys' jobs is to pull people around all day long. The second they get in, the guy goes... Jeff... Thank you so much. Come on. It's so pretty. Come on, let's show the others. So he thinks her hair is falling out and that he's dating this guy. And he's like, my God, there's... I'm bringing a guy to the prom. What am I gonna do? So then she's like, no, no, no, it's not what you think, right?

 And then, of course, the guy in the front, he's like, "What's going on back there?" And they almost hit like a curb or something. Guys... we have a little announcement we'd like to make. Don't! Jeff! Come on. Yeah. Next year a lot of us are going away to different schools, so Tina and I just made a promise to each other that we'll come back... Shh, shh, wait, wait. What is that? My God! Holy...... What is going on?

 This is crazy. This is so weird. I've never seen anything like this. Go, get a fish, bring it back, cook it. This is crazy! My God, it's alive! My God! No, no, no, no, no! Aw, dude. That's gross. No! Look at this. This is crazy. What is it? Hey, look... Hey... This is crazy. I think I may have found something you lost. I'm sorry. Look what I found. This way I get to give it back to you all over again. Guys... Run! Come on, guys, run! Come on, let's go, run! Get off the beach! Come on! Go! Run! The tsunami that hit the coast of New Jersey last night has left in its wake a trail of tears and suffering. Mother Nature's wrath has hit America yet again. We take you now to Erik Adjuk live from the New Jersey Shore. 39 are confirmed dead. Thousands of others are unaccounted for and missing. Hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage. Fortunately frigid temperatures had kept many vacationers away from the shoreline. Otherwise the death toll could be much, much higher. But the question now being asked by people, what next? Could this unprecedented disaster, still unexplained, be the start of a new ecological instability? Chapter 12. Chinese Water Torture. Sam Starr's face is contorted with pain. The Korean leans over with a hungry smile. Hey! Hey. I picked up your stuff from Tom's. Great! Eyes glistening... How was the water? It's beautiful. Just beautiful. Well, here anyway. Did you pick up a newspaper for me out there? Thanks. Did you see this? Not a chance. Look at that. Giant wave. Hit New Jersey Shore. Last night. Right out of nowhere. These storms just keep getting worse and worse. Well, "A," tidal waves are not created by tropical storms, and, "B," it couldn't have been a tidal wave in the first place. Well, that's what they're calling it in town. Yeah, well, people throw terms around, but the last recorded tidal wave in the Atlantic was 1775. 350,000 people were killed. Earthquake caused it. It hit Lisbon. Portugal. I know where Lisbon is. Well, anyway, point is, tidal waves don't happen in the Atlantic. You're the expert. But you might want to break that boycott of the media, just in case there is a warning and I'm not around to tell you about it. Okay? John, the sun is gonna rise and set whether or not I read the newspaper. Mother Nature's gonna do whatever she's gonna do. Don't you want to be around to see the sunset? I have you to protect me. By the way, I nearly finished your last book. I think this is the best one yet. Yeah, you always say that. Well, I always mean it. I just... I don't understand why they're not bestsellers. Well, because it's a conspiracy, Annabelle. Or maybe you're not ambitious enough. Ha ha ha. At least with your books I know the science parts are right. By the way, that Mrs. Wilson character. Sounds a little bit like me? See you later. I knew it. Sam Starr's face is contorted with pain. The Korean leans over with a hungry smile... **** The Korean chuckles sadistically. "Yeah, you know, the Chinese invented water torture "thousands of years ago, long before the birth of Christ. "Crucifixion is so... "unsophisticated, don't you think, Mr. Starr? "But it takes genius to take one gentle drop of water "and turn it into a... an instrument of utter agony." Another drop fell agonizingly on him. "You politicians with your high-tech bombs "and your collateral damage. "You claim to be an advanced civilization, but really, you're just cavemen in suits." **** What's this? There appears to have been some kind of eruption. The root cause of that as yet remains unclear. The Atlantic, unlike the Pacific, has no real history of tsunamis or tidal waves. So, unfortunately there's a lack of monitoring devices in place to give us the definitive answers that we need at this time. Shut up, Jack.**** Sam Starr screamed as another drop of water crashed down on his head. Crashed into his skull? Yeah, that works. **** Hello, Mr. Proofrock. How are we today? Good? The Department of Emergency is currently working on restoring power and water to the New Jersey communities south of Asbury Park. Aiding the relief effort is the Camtrell Corporation providing equipment and resources. Camtrell CEO Victor Bannister flew to New Jersey to see the tsunami's destruction firsthand. Is that him? Yeah. John McAdams? I'm Agent Clark. This is Agent Brisick. FBI. You mind if I use your bathroom? Right through there on the, left-hand side. Wipe your feet before you go in. You need to use the toilet, too? Is that why you're here? No. So this is concerning recent events, then? That's correct. And I'm requested to attend why? Well, the answer's no. You don't have much of a choice... sir. Do you need anything from inside before we go? I understand you're a writer. Fiction. Fiction is a polite word for it. I actually read one of your books. "Heroes Never Die." "Don't Die." It's an alliteration. Double "D." Right. Right. "My name is Starr. Sean Starr." The imagination is also a muscle. Any good at crosswords? No.Okay, get in. The relief effort continues on the devastated New Jersey Shore. Reserves from the National Guard have been deployed to the affected area to assist the already over-burdened rescue workers who are having to deal with an enormous human tragedy. Unconfirmed reports from the Red Cross suggest that hundreds, and possibly thousands are dead. Let's go. He's the King of Thebes. The labyrinth. The hedge. No, no, the labyrinth is... He was in the hedge looking around. Well, they were going in the... He's lost. They sent him in to look for the, um... Minotaur. The beast within. T-H-E-S-E-U-S. Seven... That's seven letters. Subject of Ancient Greek mythology, there's a... there's a very good book on the subject by Robert Graves. So this is what they've been working on for the last six years. John. John! Stanley. Heinz, how are you? It's good to see you fellows. Doctor, the director wants to see you now. John? It's over there. You guys know where you're going? Yeah, we do. Yeah, it's this... No, no, no, no. It's down here. Yeah, just down here. There it is. You sure? Yeah. John.- Great that you could make it. No, no, no, no.Yeah. Thanks for the polite invitation. Thank you, gentlemen. We'll wait outside. Well? What's going on? Sit down, John. Make yourself at home. Can I get you anything? A drink? No, it's too early. What do you want? Let's go. Look, John, I know that you don't want to be here. Well... I mean, I'd like to have the choice. If you had a choice, would you have come? Yeah, that's what I thought. Look John, these waves, they pose a serious threat to the entire Eastern Seaboard. Dealing with that is obviously a high priority. These waves? I thought there was only one. No. There were at least two others, we think. One in the western Barents Sea, the other hit the northeast coast of Greenland. Why didn't I know about that? I guess you're just out of the loop. Yeah, I guess. Well, there's an article in a Scandinavian journal. It was very speculative. I'll get you a copy. Speculative about what? Well, exactly what you'd think... Un... undetected seabed eruptions. But that far north, I mean, who knows, right? It could be a host of things. Rogue waves, polar storms. The one thing that we know for certain is that both events were accompanied by high winds. But that didn't happen here. Yes. So that's not a factor. No.So... what we're really looking at... is... No, no, no, no, no. I'm not doing this, Jack. John. John, wait. I'm out of the loop.Wait. Listen. A completely unpredictable natural force just devastated part of the American coast, okay? I'm the guy responsible for finding a solution. Now, I need the A-list of scientific minds in that room in two minutes. And I'm on that list. Of course you are, John. Look, listen. Let's just let the past be the past until we get through this, okay? Everybody should be there by now. I need your help, John. I'm on that list. Which way? This way. You sure about that? Where're we going, the boardroom? Straight ahead, boys. I want to start, gentlemen, and ladies, by thanking you all for coming on such short notice. The images that we're looking at are of the devastation caused by the tidal wave that hit the beaches of the southern shores of New Jersey. A stark reminder, if one were needed, of the importance and urgency of our task here today. There's definitely no doubt about that. Excuse me, but we have no images of the Greenland or Barents tsunamis. No we do not, Dr. Sanjee. Two of these waves originated above the Arctic Circle where the catastrophe of melting ice caps provides a possible explanation. But the most recent event is inexplicable in these terms. Except we don't know exactly how far the effects of warming have reached. Well, there is a consensus. Which is biased by special interest. This isn't a time for speculation. Let's stay focused, shall we? Please. Are you saying that all three waves seem to have originated in offshore disturbances? What does this mean? Well, it's a general term, Dr. Lichtner, meaning we don't know. The most recent incident, some sort of seismic activity was recorded, but the source remains mysterious. There's no precedent for volcanic activity. There's no precedent for this wave either. Volcanic activity is increasing. Sea levels are rising. New examples of tectonic instability are manifest in all the oceans of the world! We are dealing with a completely new set of rules here, ladies and gentlemen. Dr. Schiff, this is hardly the time or the place to promote your agenda. I'm not promoting an agenda. I'm trying to find a solution! Gentlemen, please. All right, none of us are here to promote an agenda, none of us are here to pursue personal rivalries. This is an inexplicable phenomenon of nature. Now, if Dr. Schiff's ideas can shed light on it, we are all duty-bound to listen to him. Dr. Wilcord, may I? Certainly, Dr. Lichtner. It may be also that there is disagreement here because we are looking for solutions, answers in nature. The alternative may be unthinkable. We all know that the... the technology exists. We have known this since World War II, the work of Professor Leech. There are people in this room who have worked on just such a project recently. Project Seal as I believe it was called. Sea Lion. Sea Lion, yes. I... I thank you for correcting me, Dr. McAdams. With respect, Dr. Lichtner, I think we're getting off track. Look at the evidence. The simplest solution is most usually the right one. And the solution here is that these waves were man-made. The events in Greenland and the Arctic were tests. Their locations were chosen for their remoteness. The tidal wave that hit the New Jersey coast, however, was a deliberate and direct assault on the United States. This is... Ladies and gentlemen, ple... Order. Please, can I have some order? Yes. Thank you. Dr. Lichtner, obviously we considered this idea, and trust me, we have given it a great deal of study, but the fact of the matter is, there's... there's simply no evidence to support it. Now, that's leaving aside who would commit such an act. Terrorists! It was a terrorist act! We cannot simply leap to this conclusion without first exhausting all possible alternate explanations. But the wave fits no category except for the type created during project, Sea Lion, which demonstrated the techniques for this very clearly. Dr. Lichtner... I think you'd agree that nobody knows more about the intricacies of Sea Lion than myself. Which is probably, I have no doubt, exactly why I'm here. The intent of Sea Lion... was not to create a weapon of mass destruction. The intent was to harness the power of the ocean as an answer to impending ecological disaster. It's a disaster which is being encouraged by a number of factors including overpopulation and an unfortunate addiction to fossil fuels. So, we created the technology, but we failed, you see. Because the energy source for that technology, the ocean, is fundamentally unstable. You can create a tidal wave, but you can't control it. As a humanitarian tool, it's flawed. Um, as a weapon of war, well, it's just unpredictable. Some of us remember the tragic lessons of that day. Yes, we do. However, practically, if we speak of terrorism, control is not an issue. They wish simply for destruction. They don't care where or how much. We have radar reports, Dr. Lichtner. We have satellite imagery. There's no evidence of abnormal activity in the area. Is that conclusive? For the present, yes. Until or unless other information comes to the surface. I mean, this is certainly one of a number of possible causes, and our National Security Agencies are pursuing all avenues of inquiry. However, since as of this meeting we have no evidence to support it, I feel our purpose here demands that we focus on possible natural causes. You see what I'm up against, John? You mean Sanjee and you? Two years ago at the N.R.A.S., I... I presented my Sea Wall idea. He deliberately misunderstood the whole concept. And he's ridiculed the whole thing ever since. Can you...? Thanks. Sea Wall? Well, it's not the best name, but I just wanted something that people could identify. See, what I have in mind is a very complex scheme of breakwaters and channels encircling the coast, it's a buffer against rising sea levels. You understand. You know it's coming, John. In 50 years... I mean, how much of our coastline, especially on the Atlantic side, is gonna be underwater? Right. I mean, we've got to do something. Why not start now? Here you go. Between you and me, there's some real interest in the idea. Stanley. Stanley. No, no, really. I know what you're thinking, but it's not like that this time, really. This time... Stanley. They're really interested. Stanley, Stanley... Major, major players. You've got to just relax a little bit, okay? Learn to... I don't know, go to the beach or something. No, no, no. Listen, listen. They're catching on this time. Really, they're catching on. John, believe me, this is gonna happen. I'm telling you, John, their minds are really starting to open. And you know what happens then? What? Their assets are sure to follow. John, Stanley, if I could have a quick word. I'm about to go face the wolves, but I think that it's extremely important that we all be on the same page. At least publicly for now. So John, what I'm asking is that we refrain from making any public statements. Yep.Okay. Thank you, Stanley. P.R., that's what he's all about. Yeah. This has really grown. Yeah, it's huge now. It's changed. What's the red button for? Right. And who's financing this? Well, Stanley, as a purest you ought to know. You can't serve two masters. Hi. Hi, John. Hi, Sophie. How are you? Good. I didn't know you were here. Yeah, two and a half years now. Well, I'm really out of the loop. So I hear. The hermit of Quinimac. Yeah. You have time for a coffee or anything? Yeah, sure. Let's go. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. No, it's right there. It's changed. Everything's changed. Stanley, I'll see you later. Bye. Guys. Guys, I'm just going for a coffee. So what's your role in all of this? I'm... Here I'm supposed to be second in command. But Jack being Jack... Yeah, the great pretender. Say no more. Second in command, right. First in command. No, well, he's good with corporate sponsors, so I leave that to him. He loves that stuff. Yeah. So who sponsored this conference? This one falls under the National Security umbrella. They asked for it. So we just brought people together. Well, that explains those guys. Yeah, I didn't know about that. Just take it as a compliment. Shows how much you're wanted here. Well, it's not really... It's why I'm wanted here, that's what's funny. There's a lot of concern that this could spark paranoia if people suspect it's a terrorist attack. Yeah. And you ran Sea Lion. I guess Jack thought you would be the best person to dispel the rumors. That's nice of him. Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you. Whoever they are. So how's it going with this natural, wave theory? Not well. That's not exactly why I wanted to talk to you. No? Why? Well, I guess seeing you brought back memories, that's all. Right. I never had a friend like Ann, so... Yeah? Gotta... We've got to go, right? I got to... Sorry. I've got to get back with these guys. Sorry. Ciao. Bye. Nice to see you again. All right. You know they way now? Yeah, we're going home. That's good. Annabelle. Hey. There's some chili on the stove if you're hungry. You see anybody around my place? No, why? Somebody break in? Yeah. What? They take anything? No, not that I know of. But... the door was wide open. Well, maybe the wind blew it open. No. Yeah... No, I didn't see anything. Okay, thanks. I heard a boat. A boat? Yeah, this afternoon. I didn't see it, but I heard it. Small boat. Okay. Thanks. The cleanup, currently underway, is expected to continue for several months, but the Camtrell Corporation is already focusing on reconstruction. Earlier today, after touring the disaster area, Camtrell CEO Victor Bannister pledged millions of dollars to help New Jersey residents rebuild their homes and communities. Now, despite the company being under active investigation by the Securities Commission, Bannister is heading to Boston tonight to receive a Man of the Year award from the National Entrepreneurship Association. Now, what we see on television cannot begin to depict the range of destruction. The tidal wave that hit the New Jersey coast is a wake-up call for all of us. It's time, it's way overdue that the American business community face the reality that we are in world crisis. I would like to take a moment here just to extend my own personal gratitude and thanks to the director of Operations for the Emergency Relief office, Olivia McPhee. Olivia, thank you. Olivia... Olivia... Thank you, Olivia. Thank you, thank you very much, Olivia, for all your help. Global warming is real. Ice caps melting is real. Sea levels rising is real. The future of this country and of this planet depends on us and we must face the challenge before it's too late. Thank you. Thank you all, thank you all. Thank you again, Olivia! Thank you. Now I will have a glass of wine. That was very provocative. Victor. Great speech. Thank you. Very well done. Let's hope they paid attention. Well, they pretended to. Victor? You should really say good night to Olivia. Victor? She's right over here.Victor. She right in the next room. In there. I just need to say good-bye to Victor. Yeah, don't forget to confirm the fundraising... Jack. Olivia... Excuse us. So good to see you. Thanks for coming all the way from D.C. with your plate so full. I wouldn't have missed it. I'm honored. Come. Let's have a private word. All right. Victor, it's bad enough I have to show up for this charade. I do not enjoy having it called to everyone's attention. Olivia, nothing public ever stays hidden. In the current climate, the OER should not be seen to be awarding contracts to friends. Olivia, nobody's paying any attention to this association whatsoever. Don't be so sure. The department is under intense scrutiny right now, and in case you've forgotten, so are you. I've... I've done my duty, I'm leaving. I just... Good night, Victor. Thank you. Congratulations. Thanks for coming! Good night. Well, that was an ordeal. Olivia, she just doesn't understand the show. Good evening, Mr. Bannister, I'm Arthur Brand, with the "Globe." Arthur, it's a party. Why don't you have another drink? Would you like to comment on the Justice Department's probe of Camtrell Corporation? Probe, that's a very intimate, very personal kind of thing. I understand a special prosecutor is gonna be named. Listen, if you want to write about Mr. Bannister, why don't you write about all the donations he's made to various foundations, all... Even though he likes to keep it private, all over the world. I think your car is right out front here. Victor! Sophie. Sophie, I almost missed you. I'm so proud of you. It's so nice... It's so good to see you. That was a great speech. Nothing.Yeah. Just trying to keep up with your accomplishments. Don't make me compare myself to you. No, no, no, no, no. I plagiarized my whole speech from your "Nature" article. You did? I did. Well, that's fine. Take care of him. He's a precious cargo. Good night. Give my love to Margaret. I will. Despite the probe by the Department of Justice on the allegation of bribery, Victor Bannister was honored tonight in Boston. Under heavy scrutiny by the authorities, Mr. Bannister delivered a passionate speech about global warming and its effects and consequences on the weather. How is she? She seems better. She's had a good day. I'm home, Margaret. It was quite an evening. A full house. Sophie, Ann's friend was there, sends her love. Who are you? Yeah. These aren't story notes, this is a puzzle. Number one, somebody comes into the house. Number two, they know and this is important, they know that nobody's gonna be here. Number three, they arrive by a small boat. Is this important? Maybe, maybe not. But they don't take anything as far as one can see. Instead, four, they plant something on the computer encrypted with a map. I wonder... Five, the file cannot be deleted. What are they trying to tell me? Six, a phone rings. I don't have a phone. Who are you?! You guys. What do you want? You always drive like that? Why are you following me? Orders, Doctor. Orders from who? Just doing your jobs? Is that what it is? Okay, stop following me, all right? You don't have much of a choice, Doctor. I'm out. Okay, nobody's dragging me back in this! Now leave me alone! Clark. Yeah, just a minute. What? Phone call. For me? Take it. Yeah. Amid mounting pressure for a tsunami early warning system across the East Coast, another one has been reported. The category 5 tidal wave apparently hit uninhabited areas of Newfoundland in Canada. I just feel it, that's all. Maybe I'm wrong. Jack? He was called away. So there's been another wave. Yeah, I just received the satellite imagery. It hit last night, approximately 11:50 p.m. Point of origin seems to have been here. About 600 miles offshore. And the point of impact was along this peninsula. Right there, yeah. Luckily it was uninhabited, damage is minimal. However... No, wait a minute, wait a minute. Can you zoom in there on the impact zone? Yeah. Why? Look. See that? It's the impact zone. I found that yesterday on my computer. Somebody put it there. I didn't know what it was. When yesterday? While I was here. Long before 11:50. Man-made. Has to be a reason for this being there on the computer. Somebody planted it there. Which means... they're trying to frame me in some way. This is everything I could collect. There's not much data yet, but it seems to follow the pattern. You know what this means, don't you? The wave. It has to be man-made. Aren't you jumping to a conclusion? Just... No.Take the... Listen, I'm jumping to theconclusion. Listen to me. If the wave was natural, why would somebody put a map of it on my computer before it happened? No, but why would somebody do it anyway? I don't understand the motive. Motive? Yeah. Well... Let's say there was an inquiry. So they take my computer, they open it up, they find a file with a map of a wave before it happened. What does that look like? Now, take into consideration that I am the man who created Sea Lion. I left in a storm of controversy, chip on my shoulder, yes, see, all starts to fit a profile. I look like a terrorist. You make it sound like there's a huge conspiracy. Just like in one of your books. But it's not. "One of my books." You think I'm imagining this? I don't know. I can't delete that file from my computer. Somebody put it there and they want to leave it there. You think I'm imagining that? Maybe you think I put it there? Is that it? No. I gotta go. Where are you going? I'm gonna ask some questions from somebody who can give me some answers. Okay, I'll go with you then. Why? Because I want to know. Because you think I'm paranoid. Or you think that I did it myself. I don't know, John. All right. Well, I'll tell you what. I want you to come. Please, after you. So I can prove to you that I'm not... The map actually is on my computer long before the wave actually hits and... Take care, Doc! I'm hungry. So, Marlon, where are we going for lunch? Get some chowder? Let's go grab a bite. The F.B.I. guys have stopped trailing me. So who exactly are we going to see? Mel, my computer genius. Mel. Cody. Come here. John! Hi. Hi.This is Sophie. Hi.Nice to meet you. Sophie, Mel. Nice to meet you, come on in. How you doing? Hi, I'm good, how are you? I'm good. It's really messy in here, I'm sorry. It's always messy in here. John, let me see your baby. Yeah, there she is. John, you've never met my grandma, have you? No. She is a trip. I had to take her to play mahjong. I mean, I really hope I don't live long enough that somebody has to take me to play mahjong. But she's funny, she's hilarious. Everything in here has a story. Do you guys want some tea or cookies, or some... We need to, figure this out. Okay, John, yeah.Quickly. You can't rush the genius. You ought to know that. So are you guys together? 'Cause I'm always telling John he needs to find somebody. I mean, I don't trust him out there on the ocean by himself. I keep thinking he's gonna turn into like the Unabomber or something. No, we're not together.... If you say so. Can we do this? This is... It's started up? Yes. So what's up here? Well, you see this file with the question mark? Yes. I just want to know, how did it get on there? John, you need to get with the times. Properties. 2:17 p.m. yesterday. That's exactly the time when I was at the Institute. Can you open it, by any chance? Yes, I can. Wow. What is that? This is encryption. It's really advanced. Hi, Dr. Lichtner? Yeah. No, we're in the middle of something, but... This is gonna take me a while, John. How long? Like a day. Maybe in an hour? How can I reach you? Well, you know you can't get in touch with me. I don't have a phone. I'll call you. Okay, that's fine. Just for the record... Yes? Right, I'm not computer literate, No, no. So I couldn't do that. It's fine, I got it. It's okay. A day? At least a day. Sorry, Professor. I thought you were out. All right. I'll come back later. What are you looking at? There. Where? Right there. See that? Yeah, what is it? It's a tracking device. No. I can't use this car anymore. Heinz called. He wants to see us. Where's your car? It's at my place. You want to go and get it? I believe you. Let's go. You know, this technology is making us soft. I don't think so. We still have to use our minds. For what? Well, like trying to figure out what he's doing at Sophie Marleau's condo. Well, I can make an educated guess about that. How would you like it? Black, no sugar. You look tired. I am tired. Have your coffee. I'm going to change. Um... maybe Lichtner knows something and we'll be able to figure this out. Yeah. Hey, you think they're... No, I don't think so. They were pretty tight at the Institute. Nah, that McAdams guy doesn't strike me as that kind of person. Well, they've been up there a long time. I think they are. No. Yeah. No. Yeah, you want to bet? I don't want to bet, no. Listen, I'll bet you 20 bucks. Keep your money. I don't want to bet. All right, come on, a buck. I don't want to bet. What, are you hard of hearing? I don't want to bet! You see? Are all these sculptures yours? Yeah. One of them is. The white one. How'd you know? It's nice. Better than your coffee. What's it about, then? You tell me. Do you really want to know? Yeah. What's it... What's it called? It's called "La Mort de Rayon." I thought you said you read only one of my books. Yeah, they're Jack's. He made me borrow them. I didn't know he was a fan. Yeah, apparently. He wanted me to read "Heroes Don't Die" first. Why? I don't know why. Maybe because it's about a terrorist attack on the United States of America... using a natural disaster as a weapon. Yeah, maybe. My car's in the back. I think we should go. Okay, thank you. You don't have to park. You can drop me here. I'm good by myself, goodbye. John. Can you just stay? No, no, I want to find out what he has to say. No, look, please, Sophie. This is my meeting. Can you just... Why are you underlining passages in my book? They were Jack's books. He probably marked it himself. Heinz. Thank... thank you for coming. Are you okay? No. This is why I had to see you. We should walk. Keep moving. Sure. I need to say first, what I tell you both must be confidential. Of course, Heinz.Yeah. I... I say this because I believe things have reached a critical point. What do you mean? There's going to be another wave. Why you say that? They're manmade. They're definitely manmade. There can be no question about that. Yes, I know that. So, it makes sense. After New Jersey, why create the waves that hit... hit Labrador, yeah? Somebody is trying to get a message across, yeah? And that means that they'll being using that same method, and... But who? The waves will get larger. Yes, we know that, but who's doing this? Heinz... who? John, Sophie, listen. Because we cannot know who is responsible, there is danger. We cannot trust anybody.Okay. Nobody. Don't you understand me? Yeah, I mean, this is why you called me, right? No, no, no, you called... Unh! Heinz? Heinz? Heinz! Hey! Heinz? My God, he's got a knife! Heinz? Heinz! Is there a doctor here? Heinz? Over here! Please, somebody! Sophie! Let's go! Gotta go. John! John, just talk to me please, okay. John, please come out. You can't just leave me like that on the other side of the door after what happened. You think it's all about you, but it's not. I'm part of this now, we're together, so... Come out, John! John, please come out of the bathroom, please! John, I'm scared. Come out, please. Heinz Lichtner called you. How did he know I was with you? You wanted me to believe that you're not involved in this? Well, you have to trust me when I'm saying that I'm not a part of this either. Why? I know you're being set-up. I know you didn't kill him. I know that. Yeah. Now I know that I can trust you, but you have to trust me also. Then it won't work. We interrupt regular programming for late breaking news. What? Sources close to the murder investigation confirm McAdams and Lichtner were colleagues who disagreed publicly in recent days over events surrounding the New Jersey tidal wave. More recently, McAdams authored several science-based thrillers, one of which involved terrorist attacks against the United States using manmade storm systems. Yeah, that's him. That's McAdams. And who shot this? The kid right there with the camera. Little Johnny Rotten? It's a good break for us. Is that the knife? Yeah. Entered his side, angled up under the ribcage. That's kinda precise for an amateur, don't you think? Maybe he just knows anatomy. Captain, where's your eye witness? She's supposed to be here by now. When did that call come in? 5:10. Captain, when was the time of death? 5:15. There you go, ma'am. Thank you. Now... you saw this man stab Dr. Lichtner? Yes, I saw. For sure. Yeah, some other patrons say they might have seen someone else rush... No, no, no, no, no. This man, this picture right here. Aah! There's absolutely no mistake about it. All right. Shoot. Okay, Frank, Frank... Why, why would McAdams stab and kill a man he knows really well in a public place for everyone to see him? Maybe he didn't plan to. They were talking, something got said, you know. Yeah, but that implies he brought a knife. That's premeditation. And what about that Marleau girl? Is she in it with him? Wait... We brought him over to see Jackson Wilcord, right? Right? It's... Yeah. So he leaves. So she slips him the knife. They know each other. It's possible, but... He ditches us to get to that place. Don't forget that. I'm not forgetting that. And Johnson's gonna wind up here. There's a kick and the pitch. It's outside. Martinez takes the lead. It's bottom of the seventh here. And here comes Johnson now to talk to him. So what's your call, Tommy? I think he's gonna leave him in. I hate places like this. We're meeting him here? Yeah, he should be inside. You're late. Jeez! Sorry. You scared me. Did everything go smoothly? Yes, sir, exactly according to plan. How was she? Perfect. They believed every word. There are no loose ends? No, sir. No, no, nothing. Are you sure? Absolutely. What about you? Are you a loose end? No, of course not. Even if you're tortured? No.! Even if someone forces you to tell? So few people have strength anymore.
