 GEORGE! OH! NOT WITH THE GOOD SILVER, WEEZY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME ANYWAY? DID YOU FORGET SOMETHING? NO. I REMEMBERED SOMETHING. I REMEMBERED THAT I AM THE BOSS, AND I CAN TAKE A COFFEE BREAK ANYTIME I FEEL LIKE IT. WELL, THERE'S SOME OVER THERE. THAT'S THE GOOD PART ABOUT BEING THE BOSS. YOU CAN DRINK COFFEE ALL DAY LONG, AND EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE TAKE YOU A LITTLE WIFE BREAK. AHH! GEORGE! PEACE. WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THE NEW SILVERWARE? IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BUT DO WE NEED ALL THIS STUFF? OF COURSE WE DO. THIS IS A 65-PIECE SERVICE FOR EIGHT. IT'S GOT EVERYTHING. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. I JUST FOUND THE CHITLIN' BOAT. JUST REMEMBER, THIS IS STERLING SILVER. SO AFTER YOU CLEAN IT, PUT IT AWAY REAL CAREFUL. I'M NOT PUTTING IT AWAY. I'M GONNA USE IT FOR DINNER TONIGHT. THAT SILVER IS FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS. I HAVEN'T SEEN MY UNCLE IN TEN YEARS. AND TO ME, THAT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION. NOT TO ME, IT AIN'T. THE LESS I SEE OF THAT UNCLE TOM UNCLE... UNCLE WARD. YOU HEARD ME THE FIRST TIME. UNCLE TOM. I DON'T LIKE YOU SAYING THAT. AND I DON'T LIKE HIM CHEWIN' ON MY GOOD SILVER. HEY, HEY, HEY. Y'ALL FIGHTING SO EARLY? - 00. IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY FOR YOUR FATHER. HIS MOUTH IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS 24 HOURS A DAY. LIONEL, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LUCKY YOU ARE TO HAVE THIS LADY AS YOUR MOTHER. HUH? THAT WAY YOU CAN NEVER MARRY INTO HER FAMILY. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. MOM'S UNCLE TOM. LIONEL! UNCLE WARD. I'M SORRY. DON'T BE SORRY. IF THE SHOE FITS, LET HIM SHINE IT. LIONEL, YOUR FATHER DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. BUT YOU'VE HAD THE BENEFIT OF ME, SO DON'T GO AROUND NAME-CALLING. WHAT ELSE CAN YOU CALL A MAN WHO SPENT 20 YEARS OF HIS LIFE... BEING A SLAVE FOR SOME RICH DUDE IN HYANNIS PORT? HE WASN'T A SLAVE. HE WAS A BUTLER. - DID HE HURT HIS BACK? - WHAT? WELL, YOU KNOW, ALL THAT BOWING AND SCRAPING AND KISSING PEOPLE'S FEET. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, LIONEL, BECAUSE YOU HAD IT TOO EASY. MY UNCLE WAS WORKING IN THE FIELDS WHEN HE WAS TEN YEARS OLD. HE WAS A STEVEDORE AND A MERCHANT SEAMAN BEFORE HE BECAME A BUTLER. AND A DARNED GOOD ONE. HE WAS SO GOOD AT IT, HE DON'T EVEN SOUND LIKE A COUNTRY BOY FROM THE BOTTOM NO MORE. HE TALKS LIKE ONE OF THEM UPPITY HONKIES, ALL PROPER AND SADITTY. SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING TO SCHOOL? OH, YEAH. BY THE WAY, LIONEL, HOW YOU MAKIN' OUT IN SCHOOL? IF THINGS KEEP UP LIKE THEY'RE GOING, I'M GONNA BE ON THE DEAN'S LIST. WHAT? DIDN'T I TELL YOU TO STAY OUT OF TROUBLE? I DON'T WANT YOUR NAME ON NOBODY'S LIST. POP, IT'S AN HONOR. IT MEANS I'VE BEEN GETTING GOOD GRADES. OH. OH! YEAH. LIONEL, I'M REALLY, REALLY PROUD OF YOU. MOST OF MY FAMILY NEVER EVEN GOT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL. NOW I GOT ME A SON WHO'S NOT ONLY GOING TO COLLEGE, BUT HE'S GETTING ON... WHAT'S THAT LIST? THE DEAN'S LIST. THE DEAN'S LIST. RIGHT. MAKE SURE THAT DEAN SPELLS YOUR NAME RIGHT. THAT'S JEFFERSON WITH TWO F's. AND LIONEL WITH TWO L's. GET OUT OF HERE. OW! WERE YOU WITH THAT, LOUISE? MY SON IS GONNA BE ON THE DEAN'S LIST. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT MEANS. IT MEANS THE HONOR LIST. OH. IT ALSO MEANS HE AIN'T GONNA WIND UP NO BUTLER LIKE THAT TOM UNCLE OF YOURS. LET ME REMIND YOU OF SOMETHING, GEORGE. IF MY UNCLE HADN'T HELPED US OUT DURING THE BAD DAYS, THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY FOOD ON THE TABLE. AREN'T YOU GRATEFUL FOR THAT? SURE I AM. BUT JUST BECAUSE I'M GRATEFUL DOESN'T MEAN I GOTTA LIKE HIM. WELL, DO IT FOR ME, GEORGE. YOU BE NICE TO HIM EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO FORCE YOURSELF. I CAN'T LIE ABOUT MY REAL FEELINGS. WHY NOT? I'VE LIED ABOUT MINE LOTS OF TIMES. OH, YEAH? LIKE WHEN? LIKE RIGHT NOW. MOTHER JEFFERSON. HOW NICE IT IS TO SEE YOU. ARE YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT, LOUISE? - HI, MA. - OH, GEORGE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE TODAY, MOTHER JEFFERSON? I ALWAYS VISIT ON FRIDAYS. TODAY'S THURSDAY. IT NEVER HURTS TO BE A LITTLE EARLY. OF COURSE IF I'M NOT WELCOME... OH, DON'T BE SILLY. YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME. IT'S JUST THAT WE'RE HAVING COMPANY TONIGHT AND I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU. NO PROBLEM. JUST SET ANOTHER PLACE AT THE TABLE. OH, I WOULDN'T WANT LOUISE TO PUT HERSELF OUT FOR ME. NOT THAT SHE EVER DOES. NOW, MAMA... IT'S ALL RIGHT, GEORGE. I'LL JUST SIT IN THE KITCHEN AND EAT THE LEFTOVERS. YOU'LL SIT AT THE TABLE WITH EVERYBODY ELSE. OH, HOW SWEET OF YOU TO INVITE ME. WHO'S YOUR COMPANY? IT'S MY UNCLE WARD. I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVER MET HIM. WHY, HAS HE BEEN AWAY IN JAIL? NO. HE'S RETIRED AND HE'S SPENDING A COUPLE OF DAYS WITH US... BEFORE HE GOES TO LIVE IN GEORGIA. HAVE YOU HAD BREAKFAST YET, MA? YES. BUT I COULD STAND ANOTHER CUP OF COFFEE. THERE'S A POT ON THE STOVE. GO HELP YOURSELF. HMMPH. MIGHT AS WELL GO TO A CAFETERIA... FOR ALL THE SERVICE I GET AROUND HERE. IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG DAY, GEORGE. A LONG DAY. STERLING SILVER. I SEE YOU'VE FOUND ANOTHER WAY TO SPEND GEORGE'S MONEY, LOUISE. I DIDN'T WANT IT. GEORGE BOUGHT IT, MOTHER JEFFERSON. OH, IT'S LOVELY. LOVELY. RIGHT THIS WAY, SIR. THANK YOU, SIR. SURE I CAN'T GIVE YOU A HAND WITH THOSE BAGS? NO, THANK YOU, SIR. I CAN HANDLE IT. GEORGE. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HI THERE, UNCLE. AFTER YOU, SIR. THANK YOU, SIR. "SIR"? LOUISE. UNCLE WARD. OH, IT'S BEEN SUCH A LONG TIME. LOUISE, YOU LOOK WONDERFUL. WILL THAT BE ALL, SIR? YES, THANK YOU. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS. HERE YOU ARE, RALPH. OH, THANK YOU, MR. JEFFERSON, SIR. THANK YOU KINDLY, SIR. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP, SIR. YOU'RE VERY WELCOME, SIR. SIR. SIR. LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY "SIR" TO MY DOORMAN JUST BECAUSE HE'S A HONKY. THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. IT WAS MERELY GOOD MANNERS. LOOK, THIS IS ALL THE GOOD MANNERS YOU NEED. DIDN'T YOU NOTICE? I JUST GAVE HIM TWO OF THESE, AND THE "SIRS" CAME POURING OUT. OH, MOTHER JEFFERSON. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET MY UNCLE. UNCLE WARD, THIS IS MY MOTHER-IN-LAW, MRS. JEFFERSON. - HOW DO YOU DO? - MRS. JEFFERSON. IT'S A REAL PLEASURE TO MEET YOU AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. YOU'RE MUCH YOUNGER AND FAR MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN I'D IMAGINED. THANK YOU. UH, GEORGE, UNCLE WARD MUST BE TIRED. I'M SURE HE'D LIKE TO FRESHEN UP. WHY DON'T YOU SHOW HIM TO HIS ROOM? OKAY. THANKS, LOUISE. IT'S BEEN A LONG, TIRING TRIP. YEAH, YOUR BACK MUST BE ACHING FROM ALL THAT BOWIN' AND SCRAPIN'. NO MORE THAN YOUR ARM IS FROM REACHING FOR YOUR WALLET. LOUISE, YOUR UNCLE IS A CHARMING MAN. THANK YOU. IS HE A BLOOD RELATIVE OR WAS HE ADOPTED? - I GOTTA GET BACK TO WORK. - WAIT, GEORGE. LET US GET ONE THING STRAIGHT. AS LONG AS MY UNCLE IS HERE, I DON'T WANNA HEAR ANY MORE OF THOSE NASTY CRACKS LIKE THE ONE YOU JUST MADE. UNDERSTOOD? YASSAH, MRS. JEFFERSON. SHO' NUFF, MA'AM. COME ON, FEET. GET MOVIN'. WE GOIN' TO DE DO'. AND THEN THERE WAS THE NIGHT THAT MR. MARTIN HAD INVITED 12 FOR DINNER AT 8:00. AND AT 7:00, THE COOK BROKE HER LEG. SO MR. MARTIN TURNED TO ME AND HE SAID... LOUISE, WHEN WE GONNA EAT? JUST AS SOON AS LIONEL GETS HERE. AND DON'T YELL. YOU'LL WAKE YOUR MOTHER. ISN'T SHE FEELING WELL? SHE'S FINE. SHE ALWAYS TAKES A NAP BEFORE DINNER. SHE LIKES TO BE UP TO FULL STRENGTH WHEN SHE CRITICIZES MY COOKING. CAN I FIX YOU A DRINK? YEAH. SHOW ME HOW THE BUTLERS BUTTLE. I'LL MIX YOU A DRINK THAT MR. MARTIN NAMED AFTER ME. HE CALLED IT A "WARD HEELER." ONE DRINK AND YOU'LL VOTE FOR ANYBODY. LOUISE TELLS ME YOU'RE RETIRING AND GOING BACK TO GEORGIA. - THAT'S RIGHT. - WHY WOULD ANYBODY IN HIS RIGHT MIND... WANNA GO BACK DOWN SOUTH? I SUPPOSE YOU THINK I SHOULD GO SOMEPLACE SAFE, LIKE BOSTON. RELAX. AROUND HERE, WE ANSWER OUR OWN DOOR. AGONY. MR. JEFFERSON, I'M IN AGONY. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY. DON'T EVEN BOTHER TO TAKE OFF YOUR SHOES. JUST COME ABOARD. IT'S OKAY. HE'S ENGLISH. OH, YES. OH, THAT'S IT. OH, RAPTURE. YES. OH! IT'S ALL BEGINNING TO FALL INTO PLACE NOW. OH! SHEER RAPTURE. DID IT WORK? OH, THANK YOU, MR. JEFFERSON. YOU'RE BETTER THAN ALL THE WONDER DRUGS. IT'S A PITY WE CAN'T BOTTLE YOUR FEET AND SELL THEM. HOW DID IT HAPPEN THIS TIME? IT WAS THE SILLIEST THING. I WAS COOKING MY DINNER, AND I REACHED DOWN FOR SOME OREGANO... WOULD YOU MIND NOT PUTTING YOUR SHOES ON JUST YET? NOT AGAIN? UH-HUH. AAH! THAT'S THE TROUBLE AREA. IF YOU'LL HOLD STILL, I THINK I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP. WELL, THAT'S-THAT'S ASTOUNDING. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. HOW DID YOU LEARN TO DO THAT? I'VE DONE SOME READING ON THE SUBJECT. MR. MARTIN, THE MAN I USED TO WORK FOR, GAVE ME FULL USE OF THE FAMILY LIBRARY. I DON'T BELIEVE WE'VE MET. I'M HARRY BENTLEY. HOW DO YOU DO, SIR? AND YOU MUST BE MRS. JEFFERSON'S UNCLE TOM. WHO TOLD YOU MY NAME WAS TOM? WHY, MR. JEFFERSON. WE MET IN THE ELEVATOR, AND HE TOLD ME HE WAS EXPECTING YOU. WELL, ON BEHALF OF MY BACK, I THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. I BETTER GET BACK TO MY KITCHEN BEFORE MY FETTUCCINE SELF-DESTRUCTS. GOOD-BYE. GEORGE, WHY DID YOU CALL ME AN UNCLE TOM? JUST LISTEN TO YOURSELF. "MR. MARTIN THIS," "MR. MARTIN THAT," "YES, SIR," "NO, SIR," "THREE BAGS FULL, SIR." JEFFERSON SPEAKING. OH, MR. PATTERSON. YES, SIR. NO, IT'S NO PROBLEM. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. BE GLAD TO. LOOK, IT'S MY PLEASURE. WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY, THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. OKAY. YES, SIR. GOOD-BYE. I'VE BEEN BUTTERIN' THAT HONKY UP FOR SIX MONTHS, BUT IT'S ALL WORTH IT... BECAUSE I FINALLY GOT HIS BUSINESS. HOW COME WHEN I DO WHAT YOU JUST DID, YOU CALL IT "TOMMIN'," AND WHEN YOU DO IT, IT'S BUSINESS? WHAT? DON'T COME ASKING ME NO DUMB QUESTION LIKE THAT ABOUT DIFFERENCE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS. THE DIFFERENCE IS, UH... YES? LOOK, EVERYBODY KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE. IT'S... DON'T YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE? WEEZY, LIONEL'S HOME. DO YOU REMEMBER MY SON LIONEL, WHO'S ON THE DEAN'S LIST? HI, LIONEL. HI. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? NOTHING. THERE WAS THIS FIGHT IN THE SCHOOL CAFETERIA. I TOLD YOU NOT TO GET IN TROUBLE. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, I'M OKAY. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY? MOM, I'M OKAY. WELL, THANK GOD. THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. I'M GLAD YOU FEEL THAT WAY. I JUST GOT KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL. IT WAS A TRIP. IT WAS UNREAL. THE WHITE KIDS WERE ON ONE SIDE OF ME. THE PUERTO RICAN KIDS WERE ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND THEY WAS REALLY GOING AT IT. TABLES WAS GETTING KNOCKED OVER. CHAIRS WERE FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. THAT CAFETERIA'S A MESS. HOW DID IT START? I DON'T KNOW. I WAS TOO BUSY TRYING TO GET OUT OF THERE. I GOT TRAPPED WITH THE PUERTO RICAN KIDS BETWEEN ME AND THE DOOR, RIGHT? SO I TURNED MY COLLAR AND DUCKED MY HEAD DOWN AND TRIED TO PASS. HOW ARE YOU GONNA PASS? YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE NO PUERTO RICAN. I WAS TRYING TO GET BY, AND I WAS GETTING AWAY WITH IT... TILL THIS ONE BIG DUDE WALKED UP TO ME AND SAID... SO I TRIED TO MAKE FRIENDS BY SPEAKING SPANISH, BUT ALL I COULD THINK OF AT THE TIME WAS "KEMOSABE." THAT'S HOW I GOT THIS. BUT WHAT'S ALL THAT GOT TO DO WITH YOU GETTING KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL? THE NEXT THING I KNOW, THERE WAS COPS ALL OVER THE PLACE, AND I GOT PICKED UP AND HAULED OFF WITH EVERYBODY ELSE TO THE DEAN'S OFFICE. WELL, AFTER YOU TOLD THEM YOUR STORY... HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME. WE ALL KNOW THE REASON WHY. 'CAUSE YOU BLACK. - NAH. - AIN'T NO OTHER EXPLANATION FOR IT. THERE'S GOTTA BE IN THIS CASE 'CAUSE THE DEAN'S BLACK TOO. AND THEM'S THE WORST KIND. THERE'S SOMETHING I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS. THEY CAN'T THROW YOU OUT OF SCHOOL WITHOUT A HEARING. THERE'S GONNA BE A HEARING, BUT IT AIN'T GONNA DO ME NO GOOD. WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT? THE DEAN SAID... HE WAS GONNA SEE TO IT I GET SUSPENDED. WELL, IF YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG... WELL, THE DEAN GOT ALL STEAMED UP 'CAUSE HE HATES ALL KIND OF RACIAL TROUBLE. SO I JUST TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM AND HE STARTED GETTING ALL ON MY CASE. HE WOULDN'T EVEN LISTEN. SO I JUST RAISED MY HAND TO GET HIS ATTENTION, AND THAT'S WHEN HE KICKED ME OUT OF SCHOOL. BUT, LIONEL, THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. HOW CAN YOU GET THROWN OUT OF COLLEGE JUST FOR RAISING YOUR HAND TO THE DEAN? - YOU KNOW WHAT THE PEACE SIGN IS, RIGHT? - YES. WELL, I JUST GAVE HIM HALF OF IT. WHAT THE DEVIL ARE YOU LAUGHING AT? THAT WAS A STUPID THING FOR LIONEL TO DO. WHY? HE GOT THE DEAN'S ATTENTION, DIDN'T HE? HE GOT KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL TOO. OH, YEAH. THAT WAS A STUPID THING TO DO. NOW WHAT DO WE DO? ONE THING LIONEL OUGHT TO DO RIGHT AWAY, AND THAT'S GO BACK DOWN TO THE DEAN'S OFFICE AND APOLOGIZE FOR THAT GESTURE. - YOU WOULD SAY THAT. - UNCLE WARD, MAYBE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD. BUT THESE ARE THE '70s AND I DON'T CRAWL. I DON'T TOM FOR NOBODY. LIONEL! - UNCLE WARD. - I NEED SOME FRESH AIR. WELL, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT LIONEL? I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE HIS FATHER. YOU THINK OF SOMETHING. YOU'RE HIS MOTHER. HALF OF THE THINKING OUGHT TO BE ON YOUR HEAD. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING. YOU'D PROBABLY MESS IT ALL UP ANYWAY. ARE YOU SAYING I DON'T HAVE THE BRAINS TO HANDLE THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION? I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THE FIFTH ON THAT ONE. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - SOMEPLACE WHERE I CAN THINK. I'M UP, LOUISE. THAT'S A THRILL. DID LIONEL COME HOME? YES. HE'S LOCKED HIMSELF IN HIS BEDROOM. WHERE'S GEORGE? HE'S LOCKED HIMSELF IN THE JOHN. AND WHERE HAS YOUR UNCLE LOCKED HIMSELF? HE WENT OUT. DO YOU MIND IF I GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE, LOUISE? YES. YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO CONTROL YOUR TEMPER. IT'S BREAKING UP YOUR WHOLE FAMILY. LEAVING SO SOON? WELL, I HATE TO OVERSTAY MY WELCOME. SOMEHOW I FELT I DID THAT THE MOMENT I WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR. WHERE'S LOUISE? I'D LIKE TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO HER BEFORE I GO. SHE'S OUT. SHE HAD TO GET UP EARLY THIS MORNING TO GO SHOPPING. I'LL WAIT FOR HER. DO YOU MIND IF I SERVE MYSELF A CUP OF COFFEE? NOBODY SERVES BETTER THAN YOU. TELL ME SOMETHING, GEORGE. YOU LIKE TO USE THE WORDS "UNCLE TOM" A LOT. ONLY WHEN IT FITS. DO YOU KNOW WHO UNCLE TOM REALLY WAS? SURE. HE WAS THAT DUMB NIGGA WHO USED TO THANK SIMON LEGREE FOR WHIPPIN' HIM. WRONG. THAT'S ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE LIES ABOUT OUR PEOPLE THAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AS TRUTH. WHO WAS HE THEN, SUPERFLY IN DISGUISE? NO, GEORGE. IN REAL LIFE, UNCLE TOM WAS A SLAVE NAMED JOSIAH HENSON... WHO ESCAPED AND WALKED ALL THE WAY FROM KENTUCKY TO CANADA... WITH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN. AND THERE HE STARTED THE FIRST MANUAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR OUR PEOPLE. HOW YOU KNOW THAT? I READ. SOMETIMES I LISTEN. YOU COULD DO THE SAME THING. HUH. YOU HEARD OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD? SURE. WELL, JOSIAH HENSON HELPED A HUNDRED SLAVES ESCAPE UP NORTH... EVEN BEFORE THERE WAS AN UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. HE WAS A BRAVE MAN, A GREAT LEADER. AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE, GEORGE. I'D NEVER CALL YOU AN UNCLE TOM. - I'VE GOT GREAT NEWS. WHERE'S LIONEL? - HE'S IN HIS ROOM. LIONEL! LIONEL, COME OUT HERE QUICK! TAKE IT EASY! YOU'RE SHAKIN' THE PLASTER LOOSE! WHAT IS IT, MOM? YOU'RE NOT GETTING KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL. THAT'S GREAT. HOW DO YOU KNOW? I'VE JUST BEEN DOWN... AND HAD A TALK WITH THE DEAN... WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR? WILL YOU LISTEN? I TOLD HIM WHY YOU GOT ANGRY. HE'S A FAIR MAN. HE SAID IT ISN'T THE FIRST TIME HE GOT HALF A PEACE SIGN FLIPPED AT HIM. AND? AND CONSIDERING YOUR GOOD RECORD, HE'S WILLING TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE. MEANING WHAT? MEANING, YOU CAN KISS YOUR TROUBLES GOOD-BYE. AND WHAT ELSE I GOTTA KISS? NOTHING. JUST PAY FOR YOUR SHARE OF THE DAMAGE TO THE CAFETERIA... AND SIGN A STATEMENT OF REGRET. WHOO! YEA! THEN IT'S ALL SETTLED. GREAT, WEEZY. YOU DONE GREAT. LIONEL, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A BLANK CHECK TO PAY FOR YOUR PART OF THE DAMAGES. UH-UH, POP. WHAT? I'M NOT GOING DOWN THERE AND APOLOGIZE FOR SOMETHING I DIDN'T DO AND PAY FOR IT. IT'S JUST A FEW LOUSY BUCKS AND A SIGNATURE. WHO'S GONNA KNOW THE DIFFERENCE? I WILL. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? YOU THINK EDUCATION GROWS ON TREES? YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK TO THAT SCHOOL AND YOU'RE GONNA GET THAT DIPLOMA... IF IT'S THE LAST THING I EVER DO. WHY DON'T WE ALL JUST TAKE IT EASY AND TALK THIS OUT? NOW, IF I MAY MAKE A SUGGESTION... YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. JUST STAY OUT OF THIS. LIONEL, I KNOW YOU THINK I'M NOTHING... BUT WHAT YOU CALL AN OLD UNCLE TOM. THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE. WHAT YOU DON'T REALIZE, IN MY TIME, BACK WHERE I COME FROM, BEING A TOM WAS THE ONLY WAY TO SURVIVE. THAT'S NICE, BUT I'M NOT INTERESTED IN ANCIENT HISTORY RIGHT NOW. LIONEL! HEY, MAN, GET OFF... I USED TO SPIT OUT SIX LIKE YOU BEFORE BREAKFAST, SO YOU JUST LISTEN! IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR US OLD UNCLE TOMS, YOU YOUNG BLOODS WOULDN'T BE AROUND HERE TODAY. I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN WE NEGROES... UH, BLACKS. LOOK, LIONEL, IT TOOK US A COUPLE OF HUNDRED YEARS TO GET FROM NIGGER TO COLORED, AND IT TOOK ME 25 MORE YEARS TO GET FROM COLORED TO NEGRO, SO YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO FORGIVE ME IF IT TAKES ME A LITTLE MORE TIME... TO GET TO BLACK. THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS, I AGREE WITH YOU, SON. YOU WHAT? YOU MEAN YOU WANT HIM TO STAY OUT OF SCHOOL? I DIDN'T SAY THAT. I DON'T THINK... HE SHOULD SIGN AN APOLOGY FOR SOMETHING HE DIDN'T DO. ALL RIGHT. BUT I DO THINK YOU SHOULD GO DOWN AND TALK TO THE DEAN. OH, I GET IT. YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SIGN, BUT YOU DO WANT ME TO CRAWL. NO. I WANT YOU TO GO DOWN THERE AND FIGHT TO STAY IN THAT SCHOOL. EXCEPT THIS TIME USE YOUR BRAINS INSTEAD OF YOUR HANDS... AND SHOW THAT DEAN WHO'S THE BETTER MAN. YEAH, YOU SHOW HIM. YEAH, WELL, THAT'S EASY TO SAY. BUT WHEN I'M TALKING TO SOMEBODY WHO AIN'T LISTENING, I GET MAD. - AND WHEN I GET MAD, I START HOLLERING. - HE TAKES AFTER HIS FATHER. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. WHEN YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT, A LITTLE MOUTH GOES A LONG WAY. - YEAH. - WHEN YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT. - YOU REALLY THINK IT'LL WORK, UNCLE WARD? - SURE IT WILL. LISTEN TO YOUR UNCLE WARD. HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. OKAY. OKAY, I'LL GIVE IT A TRY. YOU GONNA BE HERE WHEN I GET BACK? 'COURSE HE WILL. THE MAN JUST GOT HERE. HE'S HARDLY HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT WITH US. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU LATER. UH-OH. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. ALL RIGHT. TAKE CARE. WELL, SINCE I'M GONNA BE STAYING, I GUESS I'LL TAKE THESE BAGS BACK TO MY ROOM. WOOP! I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT, SIR. WHAT DID HE SAY? I THINK HE SAID "SIR." THAT'S RIGHT. YOUR UNCLE'S OLDER THAN ME. IT'S JUST A SIGN OF RESPECT. DON'T YOU KNOW NOTHIN', WEEZY? YOU KNOW SOMETHING, WEEZY? THIS BLACK HISTORY IS REALLY INTERESTING. YES. WASN'T IT NICE OF UNCLE WARD TO SEND YOU THOSE BOOKS? WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL, THE ONLY BLACK HISTORY WE LEARNED ABOUT WAS... LITTLE BLACK SAMBO AND BLACK BEAUTY. A MIDGET AND A HORSE. WELL, MY EDUCATION WAS BETTER THAN YOURS, GEORGE. I WENT TO THE DISNEY MOVIES... AND I LEARNED ALL ABOUT BRER RABBIT, UNCLE REMUS... AND ZIPPITY-DO-DAH. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO? I'M GONNA SEND THIS BOOK TO PRESIDENT FORD. WHAT FOR? HE CAN LEARN ABOUT GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER. LOOK, IF GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER WAS ALIVE TODAY, WE WOULDN'T HAVE NO ENERGY CRISIS. HUH? ANYBODY THAT CAN GET OIL FROM A PEANUT... WOULDN'T HAVE NO TROUBLE GETTING OIL OUT OF THEM ARABS. ♪♪ ♪♪ THE JEFFERSONS WAS RECORDED ON TAPE IN FRONT OF A STUDIO AUDIENCE.
