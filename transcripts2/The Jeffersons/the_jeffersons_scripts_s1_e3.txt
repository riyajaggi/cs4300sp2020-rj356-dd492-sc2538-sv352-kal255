 WHY NOT? BECAUSE I'M BEING PRESUMPTUOUS. I DON'T THINK WE KNOW EACH OTHER WELL ENOUGH... TO, UH... TO WHAT? ESPECIALLY WITH PRICES BEING WHAT THEY ARE TODAY. COME ON, MR. BENTLEY. YOU CAN ASK ME ANYTHING. MAY I BORROW A CUP OF SUGAR? I'VE RUN OUT OF SUGAR AND I HAVEN'T HAD MY MORNING TEA YET. I CAN'T STAND TEA WITHOUT... I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU. OH, YOU CAN BORROW A CUP OF SUGAR. NO. I'D FEEL EASIER IN ASKING TO BORROW A CUP OF MONEY. EXCEPT IT WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH TO PAY FOR THE SUGAR, WOULD IT? I'M AFRAID THE WORLD IS IN A SWEET MESS. AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH. THE OIL COMPANIES HAVE GOT US OVER A BARREL, AND THE SUGAR COMPANIES ARE GIVING US OUR LUMPS. WELL, I THINK PRESIDENT FORD WILL STRAIGHTEN IT ALL OUT... AS SOON AS SOMEBODY TELLS HIM HOW. WELL, YOU WORK AT THE UNITED NATIONS. CAN'T THEY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT? THANK YOU. NO, I'M JUST AN INTERPRETER. I DON'T TELL THEM WHAT TO DO. I JUST TELL THEM WHAT THEY SAID. WHY DON'T YOU VISIT FOR A WHILE, AND I'LL MAKE US BOTH SOME TEA. THE WATER'S ON ALREADY. I COULDN'T PUT YOU TO ALL THAT TROUBLE. YOU MUST BE VERY BUSY. BUSY? OH, SURE. I'LL TELL YOU MY PLANS FOR TODAY. FIRST, I PLAN TO SIT IN THIS CHAIR FOR A HALF AN HOUR... AND LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION. THEN I'LL MOVE OVER TO THE SOFA AND LOOK IN THAT DIRECTION. THEN COMES THE HIGH POINT OF THE DAY. I'LL DO SOMETHING EXCITING LIKE FILLING THE SALT-AND-PEPPER SHAKERS. MAKING TEA WILL SPOIL MY WHOLE SCHEDULE. BUT SO WHAT? LET'S LIVE A LITTLE. THANK YOU. BUT I INSIST WE USE MY SUGAR. GOOD MORNING, LIONEL. OH, HI, MR. BENTLEY. BYE, MOM. YOU GOING TO CLASS ALREADY? YEAH. LOOK, HEY, MOM. COULD YOU DO ME A REALLY BIG FAVOR? SURE, LIONEL. ANYTHING. JUST NAME IT. STAY OUT OF MY ROOM. BUT I WAS GONNA CLEAN IT TODAY. YEAH, BUT YOU CLEANED IT YESTERDAY AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT. LET THE CLEANING WOMAN DO IT. I CAN'T LET HER GO IN THERE. YOU KEEP YOUR ROOM IN SUCH A MESS. YEAH, BUT IT'S MY MESS. YOU DIG? YOU GOTTA DIG IF YOU WANNA FIND ANYTHING IN THAT DISASTER AREA. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU THINK THAT'S A MESSY MESS, BUT IT'S NOT. THAT IS AN ORGANIZED MESS. SEE, I KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING IS AND I LOVE MY MESS BECAUSE IT'S MY MESS. IF I DIDN'T SEE IT WAS YOU, I'D SWEAR I WAS TALKING TO YOUR FATHER. THANKS, MA. I'LL SEE YOU LATER. BUT CAN I FIX YOU SOME BREAKFAST? THAT'S OKAY. I'LL GET SOMETHING OUT OF THE SCHOOL CAFETERIA. THE NEXT TIME YOU NEED SOME MOTHERING, TRY GETTING THAT FROM THE CAFETERIA. IT'S UNREAL HOW FAST THESE KIDS GROW UP AND AWAY FROM YOU. STILL, IT MUST GIVE YOU A MARVELOUS SENSE OF FULFILLMENT. I HATE IT. HE DOESN'T NEED ME ANYMORE. HOW IS IT? I CAN TASTE THE BAG. OH, BUT IT'S A VERY GOOD BAG. OH, WELL, EVERYTHING IS LOUSY. MAYBE BECAUSE IT'S MONDAY. YOU CAN'T BLAME IT ON MONDAY BECAUSE, YOU SEE, ACTUALLY IT'S TUESDAY. WELL, ONE DAY LOOKS JUST LIKE THE OTHER TO ME. REALLY? I ALWAYS THINK OF TUESDAY AS SORT OF A YELLOWY ORANGE. I USED TO THINK THAT MONEY WOULD BE THE ANSWER... TO ALL OUR PROBLEMS, BUT IT AIN'T. WHEREAS MONDAY HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME A SORT OF A BLUISH GREEN. WAIT A MINUTE. THIS IS MONDAY. GOOD LORD. I'M DUE AT THE U.N. IN 15 MINUTES. THE MIDEAST CRISIS AGAIN. DOES IT LOOK LIKE ANOTHER WAR? IT COULD BE. IF I'M NOT THERE IN TIME TO TRANSLATE, THEY WON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE FIGHTING ABOUT. IT WAS VERY NICE TO SEE YOU. GOOD-BYE. HE'S WEIRD. EVEN FOR AN ENGLISHMAN, HE'S WEIRD. I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME EARLY, GEORGE. WHAT CAN I FIX YOU FOR LUNCH? NOTHING. I CAME HOME EARLY TO TELL YOU I WON'T BE HOME FOR LUNCH. WHAT? I GOT A BUSINESS LUNCH TO GO TO. A BUSINESS LUNCH? YOU DIDN'T TELL ME. I CAN'T REMEMBER TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING, WEEZY. YOU'RE NEVER HERE LONG ENOUGH TO TELL ME ANYTHING. WELL, I'M TELLING YOU NOW, AIN'T I? NOW IS NO GOOD. I WANNA KNOW THEN. NOW OR THEN, WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? I'M STILL NOT COMING HOME FOR LUNCH. LUNCH IS NOT THE POINT. I WANT YOU TO START THINKING OF ME FOR A CHANGE. I AM THINKING OF YOU. THAT'S WHY I DON'T HAVE TIME TO TELL YOU NOTHING. HUH? I GOTTA KEEP BUILDING THE BUSINESS. I DON'T HAVE ANY TIME TO BE HANGING AROUND PARTYING AND CARRYING ON. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE COMPETITION IS LIKE IN THE CLEANING GAME. IT'S LIKE A JUNGLE OUT THERE. WELL, HEAR THIS, TARZAN. IT AIN'T SO HOT FOR JANE IN THE TREE HOUSE NEITHER. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? IT'S THIS NEW LIFE OF OURS. GREAT, AIN'T IT? YEAH, FOR YOU, LIONEL AND THE CLEANING WOMAN. NOBODY NEEDS ME ANYMORE. I GOT NO REASON FOR GETTING OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING. SURE YOU DO. BEING MRS. GEORGE JEFFERSON... IS ALL THE REASON ANY WOMAN COULD WANT FOR GETTING OUT OF BED. A PERSON COULD TAKE THAT TWO WAYS, GEORGE. AND I DO. LOOK, WHY DON'T I GO DOWN TO THE CLEANING STORE AND WORK PART-TIME? 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO WORK. YOU'VE WORKED LONG ENOUGH. YOU'VE EARNED THE RIGHT TO DO WHAT ALL THE OTHER HIGH-CLASS NEW YORK LADIES DO. NOTHING. I'VE TRIED THAT. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH NOTHING TO DO. THERE'S PLENTY TO DO. GO TO A MUSEUM. GO SHOPPING. GO TO A THEATER. THAT'S NOT MY BAG. THEN BUY YOURSELF A NEW BAG. LOOK, THERE'S NO USE SITTING AROUND AND COMPLAINING. YOU JUST HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO WASTE YOUR TIME. OKAY. I'LL START BY WASTING SOME TIME IN THE CLEANING STORE DOWNSTAIRS. NO WAY. WHAT ARE MY EMPLOYERS GONNA THINK... IF THEY SEE MY WIFE WORKING ALONGSIDE THEM? I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY THINK. WELL, I'LL DO THE CARING FOR BOTH OF US. AND YOU AIN'T GONNA WORK. I HAVE SPOKEN. GEORGE... NOW, HERE'S $20. I WANT YOU TO GO TO A MATINEE TODAY. BUT I DON'T WANNA GO. YOU'RE GOING ANYWAY. YOU'RE GONNA LEARN HOW TO ENJOY LIFE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE THIS SHOW GEORGE SENT ME TO. MY EYES MUST HAVE BEEN POPPING OUT OF MY HEAD. THERE THIS MAN WAS UP ON THE STAGE, STARK NAKED. HE WASN'T LIKE THIS. HE WASN'T LIKE THIS. HE WASN'T EVEN LIKE THIS. HE WAS LIKE THIS. SOUNDS LIKE A SPECTACULAR SHOW. ONLY IF YOU LIKE A WHOLE STAGE FULL OF RAW TALENT. AND THE AUDIENCE. TWO THOUSAND WOMEN FROM NEW JERSEY, ALL WEARING HATS AND TALKING AT ONCE. THE ONLY TIME THEY STOPPED WAS IN THE FUNERAL SCENE WHEN THE PRIEST SAID A FEW WORDS. BUT IF EVERYBODY WAS NAKED, HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS A PRIEST? WELL, I KNEW IT WASN'T A NUN. WHAT'S THIS SUDDEN INTEREST IN THE THEATER, LOUISE? OH, IT'S ALL GEORGE'S IDEA. HE'S TRYING TO TURN ME INTO SOMETHING I AIN'T. - YOU MEAN LIKE MY FAIR LADY? - I DON'T EVEN THINK GEORGE... COULD MANAGE THAT TRICK. OH, I'M SORRY TO KEEP BRINGING MY TROUBLES TO YOU, BUT THERE'S NO ONE ELSE I CAN TALK TO. AND YOU TWO SEEM TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE YOUR PROBLEMS SO WELL. - WHAT PROBLEMS? - WELL, UH... YOU KNOW... YOU AND HELEN. OH, THE BIGGIE. THAT'S NOT OUR PROBLEM. IT'S OTHER PEOPLE'S. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO CAN'T HANDLE IT. NOT EVEN OUR OWN PARENTS. REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST TOLD YOUR MOTHER ABOUT US? I NEVER HEARD SUCH YELLING AND SCREAMING. THAT WAS MY FATHER. MY MOTHER DIDN'T SAY A WORD. BECAUSE SHE FAINTED. THEN THERE WAS THE DISINHERITANCE. THE FOLKS CUT US OFF WITHOUT A CENT. OH, THAT'S TERRIBLE. WERE YOUR FOLKS THAT MAD, TOM? NOT MY FOLKS. HERS. THE POINT IS, IF YOU FEEL YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'VE GOT TO DO THINGS YOUR OWN WAY. TRY TELLING GEORGE THAT. THAT REMINDS ME. MAY I USE YOUR PHONE? SURE. I WANNA FIND OUT WHAT TIME HE'S COMING HOME FOR DINNER... IF HE'S COMING HOME FOR DINNER. GOOD EVENING, MRS. WILLIS. MR. WEXLER, COME IN. I'M SORRY I'M LATE WITH THE CLEANING, BUT MY WIFE IS STILL SICK, AND YOU KNOW MY BUSINESS IS JUST A MOM-AND-POP OPERATION. AND AT MY AGE, WHEN THERE'S NO MOM, POP DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH PEP. - WHY DON'T YOU HIRE SOME HELP? - HELP? THE LAST HELP I HIRED HELPED HIMSELF. TWENTY-EIGHT DOLLARS FROM THE CASH REGISTER. OH, I'M SORRY. I WOULDN'T HAVE CARED SO MUCH, BUT IT WAS MY OWN BROTHER-IN-LAW. IT ISN'T EASY FOR ME TO WORK WITH SOMEBODY. I'M FUSSY. IN MY OWN FAMILY, THEY CALL ME THE OLD LADY. OH, MR. WEXLER. NO, IT'S TRUE. I'M NOT SO COMFORTABLE WITH PEOPLE. WITH ME, IT TAKES TIME. OH, MR. WEXLER, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MY FRIEND, MRS. JEFFERSON. HER HUSBAND IS IN... HOW DO YOU DO? WHEN I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO DO, I DO IT FINE. WHEN I'VE GOT NOTHING TO DO, I DO IT LOUSY. - AND IT TAKES YOU LONGER. - THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, I'D BETTER GET BACK AND SEE IF MY STORE'S STILL THERE. - I HOPE YOU CAN HIRE SOME HELP SOON. - I'LL LOOK AROUND... TILL I FIND SOMEBODY WHO'S COMFORTABLE. - WHERE IS YOUR STORE? - RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER ON LEXINGTON AVENUE. GOOD-BYE. OH, MR. WEXLER. WOULD I FEEL COMFORTABLE? YOU MEAN YOU'D LIKE TO WORK FOR ME? I DON'T THINK YOU WANT TO WORK FOR MR. WEXLER. WHY NOT? DON'T YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE WORKING IN A STORE? - PLENTY OF EXPERIENCE. - LOUISE, I THINK HELEN IS RIGHT. I'M ONLY DOING WHAT SHE TOLD ME TO DO. "IF YOU FEEL YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'VE GOT TO DO THINGS YOUR OWN WAY." THAT'S A NICE PHILOSOPHY, MRS. JEFFERSON. I LIKE IT. WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY COMFORTABLE TOGETHER. HERE'S MY CARD. YOU CAN START TOMORROW, 9:00 SHARP. OKAY. I'LL BE THERE. FINE. I'LL SEE YOU ALL SOON. WE SHOULD LIVE AND BE WELL. YOU I'LL SEE TOMORROW, REGARDLESS. HOW ABOUT THAT? I'M GOING TO WORK. HELEN, YOU WERE RIGHT. YOU'VE GOT TO DO WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO DO. - I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE YOU'VE GOTTA DO. - WHAT? READ THAT CARD. "WEXLER'S CLEANING AND DYEING." A CLEANING STORE.

AND I FINALLY GOT YOUR MOTHER ACTING LIKE A NEW WOMAN. - I GOT HER EATING OUT OF THE PALM OF MY HAND. - HOW DID YOU DO THAT? WELL, IT'S THE OLD GEORGE JEFFERSON METHOD OF WOMAN HANDLING. IT TOOK ME YEARS TO FIGURE IT OUT. YOU WANNA TURN ME ON TO IT, POP? SURE. IF YOU WANT A WOMAN EATING OUT OF THE PALM OF YOUR HAND, ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS GIVE HER FREEDOM, A SWINGING APARTMENT... AND ALL THE MONEY SHE CAN SPEND. AH. BUT WHAT IF YOU AIN'T GOT NO MONEY? THEN IT COMES A LOT HARDER. THEN YOU GOT TO GIVE HER A LOT OF LOVE AND AFFECTION. I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS AND TRY OUT YOUR SYSTEM ON JENNY. JENNY AGAIN? DON'T WORRY. I AIN'T GONNA SPEND NO MONEY. I'M JUST GONNA TRY THE LOVE AND AFFECTION PART. - OH, THAT WAS QUICK. - WELL, I COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU, GRANDMA. - I'LL SEE YOU LATER. - MAMA! HI. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU, GEORGE. YOU ALWAYS MAKE ME FEEL SO WELCOME. WHERE'S LOUISE? DIDN'T SHE GO TO THE THEATER WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON? DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT WOMAN. NOW, NOW, MAMA, LOUISE IS MY WIFE. THAT'S NOT MY FAULT. WHAT YOU SO MAD ABOUT? SHE NEVER SHOWED. I WAITED OUTSIDE THAT THEATER FOR THREE HOURS. MY FEET ARE KILLING ME. YOU WERE STANDING FOR THREE HOURS? WELL, NO. LUCKY FOR ME THERE WAS A PLACE TO SIT DOWN NEAR THE THEATER. OUT ON THE SIDEWALK? NO. IN A COCKTAIL LOUNGE. I SAT THERE AND HAD TO FORCE MYSELF... TO DRINK FOUR BLOODY MARYS... BEFORE I REALIZED SHE WASN'T GONNA SHOW. WELL, IF LOUISE WASN'T THERE, THERE'S GOT TO BE A GOOD REASON FOR IT. I'M SURE THERE IS. SHE'S PROBABLY OUT SHOPPING AND SPENDING MONEY, DOING THINGS I TOLD HER TO DO. - MM. - LOOK, MA, IF YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY, JUST SAY IT AND STOP BEATING AROUND THE BUSH. GEORGE, SIT. YOU KNOW ME. IF I CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICE ABOUT A PERSON, I DON'T SAY ANYTHING AT ALL. THAT'S WHY I SELDOM TALK ABOUT LOUISE. BUT... BUT I KNOW WHAT'S COMING NEXT. - YOU'RE GONNA SAY SHE'S FOUND ANOTHER MAN. - WELL, I HAVE BEEN CALLING... EVERY AFTERNOON THIS WEEK AND SHE HASN'T BEEN HOME ONCE. THERE YOU GO AGAIN. YOU ALWAYS THINK EVERYBODY'S OUT MESSIN' AROUND. WELL, IF YOU LIVE AMONG THE WHITE FOLKS, SOME OF THEIR WAYS ARE BOUND TO RUB OFF. WE'VE ONLY BEEN HERE A COUPLE OF WEEKS. YOU'VE BEEN TALKING THIS SAME TALK FOR 25 YEARS. NOW, GEORGE, YOU KNOW THAT ISN'T SO. YOU KNOW IT IS SO. EVERY TIME WE HAVE A FAMILY GET-TOGETHER, YOU ALWAYS BRING UP THAT SAME OLD TIRED STORY... ABOUT OLD MAN KIRBY CHEATING WITH COUSIN MILDRED. THAT'S NOT A STORY. THAT'S A FACT. OLD MAN KIRBY COULDN'T WAIT TO GET HOME TO HIS WIFE EVERY NIGHT. AND WHO WOULD WANT TO BE WITH COUSIN MILDRED ANYWAY? WELL, AFTER ALL, SHE MAY NOT BE THE PRETTIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD... BUT SHE SURE AS HELL IS THE UGLIEST. NOW, LISTEN, GEORGE. LISTEN. THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE MAY BE ALL RIGHT FOR LOUISE, BUT NOT IN FRONT OF YOUR MOTHER. OKAY, I'M SORRY. BUT ALL THE YEARS WE'VE BEEN MARRIED, LOUISE HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS. TILL NOW. COME ON, MA. I KNOW LOUISE. I TRUST HER. ALL RIGHT. WHERE IS SHE? YEAH. WHERE IS SHE? OH, HI, GEORGE. HELLO, MOTHER JEFFERSON. WHERE YOU BEEN, WOMAN? WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU? - ANSWER MY QUESTION! - I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS, BUT I KNOW WHERE SHE WASN'T. MOTHER JEFFERSON, THE THEATER. I FORGOT. I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY. NEVER MIND HER APOLOGY. WHAT ABOUT MY EXPLANATION? I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLAIN YOU. LOUISE, LET'S GET RIGHT DOWN TO THE NITTY-GRITTY. I WANNA KNOW WHERE YOU BEEN. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? GEORGE, KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN. WHY? - SO YOU CAN HEAR ME! - ALL I WANNA HEAR FROM YOU IS WHERE YOU BEEN. YOU AIN'T GONNA HEAR NOTHING BECAUSE I'M THROUGH TALKING! SO AM I! I AM SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME. I'VE GOT THE MOST AMUSING ANECDOTE TO TELL YOU. LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, BENTLEY. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF A WOMAN WHO KEEPS SECRETS FROM HER HUSBAND? WELL, SPEAKING AS A BACHELOR, I'M ALL FOR IT. I'VE BEEN WANTING TO ASK YOU, HOW'S THE NEW JOB? - NEW JOB? WHAT NEW JOB? - NOTHING. NOTHING. - WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A NEW JOB? - STOP INTERRUPTING, GEORGE. - MR. BENTLEY IS TELLING US A STORY. - YES. IT WAS AT THE U.N... AND I WAS TRANSLATING FROM THE RUSSIAN. AND THE AMBASSADOR WAS DESCRIBING THE ARRIVAL OF THE CHINESE DELEGATION, AND HE USED THE PHRASE... WHICH, OF COURSE, MEANS "WITHOUT A HITCH." DID YOU GET A JOB WITHOUT ASKING ME? WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER. AS YOU WERE SAYING, MR. BENTLEY? WELL, I THOUGHT HE SAID... WHICH I TRANSLATED "WITHOUT A BITCH." I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT LATER. I WANNA TALK ABOUT IT NOW. ALL RIGHT, GEORGE, YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT NOW, WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT NOW. I DON'T THINK THEY QUITE GOT THE POINT. SHH, SHH. I WANNA HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. SORRY. PERHAPS IT WOULD BE CLEARER IF I WRITE IT DOWN. ALL RIGHT, GEORGE, I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW. I'M WORKING AT WEXLER'S CLEANING STORE. WEXLER'S CLEANING STORE? THE GUY THAT'S TRYING TO RUN ME OUT OF BUSINESS? WELL, I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU... WAIT. THAT MIGHT BE THE SMARTEST MOVE YOU'VE EVER MADE. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO BREAK ZIPPERS AND TEAR OFF BUTTONS? GEORGE! THAT'S SABOTAGE. NO, IT AIN'T. THAT'S BUSINESS. - WELL, I'M NOT GONNA DO IT. - OH, YOU'D RATHER STAB ME IN THE BACK. AND IT PROBABLY ISN'T THE FIRST TIME. YOU STAY OUT OF THIS. I'M ONLY TRYING TO HELP. YOU ALREADY DID. YOU HELPED US GET IN THIS BIG FIGHT. WELL, NOW, I DON'T HAVE TO STAND HERE AND BE INSULTED. YOU ARE SO RIGHT. YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE AND BE INSULTED! I'M LEAVING! NOW SEE WHAT YOU'VE DONE. GOOD. 'CAUSE I'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE! AND I'VE HAD IT UP TO HERE! NOW. THERE. NOW, JUST READ THIS. HELLO? WEEZY. YOU COULDN'T SLEEP EITHER, HUH? IT WAS TERRIBLE LAYING THERE LIKE THAT. YEAH, BOTH OF US PRETENDING TO BE SLEEP. BUT YOU PRETENDED BETTER THAN I DID. YOU WERE SNORING. - YOU WANT SOME COCOA? - LOVE SOME. LOUISE... GEORGE, I'M SORRY I WENT BEHIND YOUR BACK. BUT I FELT SO UNHAPPY AND USELESS. LOOK, I WAS THE ONE WHO WAS WRONG. TOO BULLHEADED TO UNDERSTAND YOUR PROBLEM. IF YOU WANNA WORK PART-TIME, IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH ME. BUT NOT FOR THE COMPETITION. I CAN WORK AT THE STORE? SURE. OH, THANK YOU, GEORGE. THE NEW ONE I'M OPENING, UP IN THE BRONX. THE BRONX? YOU DON'T THINK I WANT THESE LOCAL HONKIES SEEING MY WIFE WORKING? ALL THE WAY UP IN THE BRONX? LISTEN, GEORGE... NOW, DON'T SPOIL IT, LOUISE. WE JUST MADE UP. YOU ONLY THINK WE MADE UP! LOOK, WE'RE GONNA HAVE PEACE AND QUIET AROUND HERE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. YOU LISTEN TO ME, GEORGE JEFFERSON. YOU'RE NOT SENDING ME TO THE BRONX! YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTS TO WORK. AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT A STORE DOWNSTAIRS, THAT'S WHERE I'M WORKING! NOW, I'M GONNA WORK DOWNSTAIRS OR ELSE! AND THAT'S THAT! HEY, POP, I SEE YOU'VE GOT HER EATING OUT OF YOUR HAND AGAIN. HOW CAN YOU EAT A SARDINE SANDWICH 3:00 IN THE MORNING, WITH ONIONS? FIGHTING MAKES ME HUNGRY. THERE'S ANOTHER GOOD THING ABOUT FIGHTING, THOUGH. WHAT? THE PART WHERE YOU KISS AND MAKE UP. UH, BUT IN THIS CASE, SUPPOSE WE JUST SHAKE HANDS? ♪♪ ♪♪ THE JEFFERSONS WAS RECORDED ON TAPE IN FRONT OF A STUDIO AUDIENCE.
