 IT BETTER BE ME, OR YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. I KNEW IT WAS YOU. WHY ARE YOU ACTING SO SILLY? I GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU, AND I WANTED TO PUT YOU IN A GOOD MOOD FIRST. WHY? IS IT BAD NEWS? NO, IT AIN'T BAD NEWS, BUT IT AIN'T EXACTLY GOOD NEWS. WHAT'S THE TROUBLE, GEORGE? NOTHING, BUT I THINK YOU BETTER SIT DOWN FIRST. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO TELL ME? I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND IT'S NOTHING SERIOUS, EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS. GEORGE JEFFERSON, WILL YOU PLEASE TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON? - OKAY. I'LL TELL YOU ON ONE CONDITION. - WHAT'S THAT? YOU GOT TO PROMISE NOT TO THROW YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR AND SAY "OH, MY GOD!" OKAY? - OKAY. - I JUST CAME BACK FROM THE DOCTOR... OH, MY GOD! YOU PROMISED. GEORGE, WHAT IS IT? TELL ME! WELL... WELL, THE DOCTOR SAID... I WANT THE TRUTH, GEORGE. THE TRUTH, GEORGE, THE TRUTH. WELL, THE DOCTOR... NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, I CAN TAKE IT. HOW CAN YOU TAKE IT BEFORE I GIVE IT? NOW JUST HUSH UP AND LET ME SAY MY PEACE, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. WELL, THE DOCTOR SAID I GOT AN ULCER. AN ULCER? UHH! THERE IT IS. OH, YOU POOR DARLING. DID HE GIVE YOU SOMETHING FOR THE PAIN? YEAH. HE GAVE ME A DOWNER. A PILL? NO, A BILL. A HUNDRED AND TEN DOLLARS. MADE ME NUMB ALL OVER. IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP? NO. THE DOCTOR GAVE ME SOME WHITE TABLETS TO CHEW ON, THEN PUT ME ON A SPECIAL DIET. WHAT KIND OF DIET? YOU KNOW, STUFF LIKE MILK, RICE, FARINA. UGH! I HATED THAT MUSH EVEN AS A BABY. BUT, GEORGE, IF IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER... IT AIN'T FAIR. I MEAN, ALL THOSE YEARS EATING NOTHING BUT JUNK FOOD, LIVIN' IN TENEMENTS, NOT A DIME TO MY NAME, AND I NEVER GOT SICK A DAY IN MY LIFE. NOW I'M EATING GOOD FOOD, GOT LOTS OF MONEY TO SPEND, AND I STILL GET SICK. HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT? MAYBE BECAUSE YOUR STOMACH HASN'T SEEN YOUR BANKBOOK. [Groans] YOU AIN'T HELPIN' ME NONE, WEEZY. OH, I'M SORRY, GEORGE. WHY DON'T YOU LIE DOWN AND TAKE IT EASY? YEAH, GOOD IDEA. WHAT YOU GOT THERE? OH, I'M JUST TRYING TO CLEAN OUT THE JUNK WE'VE COLLECTED OVER THE YEARS. HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE KEPT THIS STUFF IN THE FIRST PLACE. LIKE THIS, FOR INSTANCE. HEY, YOU AIN'T THROWING THAT OUT. THAT'S MY BOXING TROPHY I WON IN THE NAVY. I WAS THE ONLY ONE ON THE SHIP WITH A PERFECT RECORD. FIVE FIGHTS AND FIVE KNOCKOUTS. BUT YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE A TERRIBLE FIGHTER. I WAS. IT WAS ME THAT ALWAYS GOT KNOCKED OUT. "TO GENTLEMAN GEORGE. THE ONLY THING HE EVER HIT WAS THE CANVAS." [Doorbell Rings] WHY DON'T YOU CHECK THROUGH THE BOX... AND SEE WHAT ELSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO KEEP. HI, LOUISE. OH, HI, COME IN. NO, I HAVE TO GET TO THE BANK. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE IN. WHAT FOR? WELL, TOM'S HOME NOW, SO I'LL GET HIM TO BRING DOWN THAT LOUNGE CHAIR WE GOT FOR YOUR TERRACE. OH, THANK YOU. WE'LL BE DOWN AS SOON AS I GET BACK FROM THE BANK. BYE. WELL, HURRY BACK, HELEN. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT. THAT'S THE KIND OF VISITS I LIKE FROM MRS. HALF AND HALF WILLIS: SHORT AND OUTSIDE THE DOOR. GEORGE! OKAY, OKAY. FORGET IT. HEY, LOOK AT THIS HANDSOME SELF. AIN'T THAT A GREAT PICTURE OF ME IN MY DRESS WHITES? OH, YOU WERE SO CUTE. CUTE? THAT AIN'T NO WAY TO BE TALKIN' TO NO WAR HERO. I HAD ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS JOBS IN THE NAVY, YOU KNOW. I THOUGHT YOU WORKED IN THE KITCHEN. I DID, AND I HAD TO FACE 200 ANGRY SAILORS... AFTER THEY ATE MY COOKIN'. HEY, HERE'S ONE I AIN'T SEEN IN A LONG TIME. PICTURE OF ME AND YOU RIGHT AFTER WE GOT ENGAGED. AIN'T THAT NICE? YEAH. IT'S A GOOD PICTURE OF YOU, BUT HALF OF ME IS CUT OFF. AIN'T THAT A DRAG? WHO'S THE DUMBBELL WHO TOOK THIS PICTURE? YOUR MOTHER. OH, WELL, THEN YOU MUST'VE MOVED. IF I HADN'T MOVED, I WOULDN'T BE IN THE PICTURE AT ALL. OH, YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY MAMA DID IT ON PURPOSE, HUH? NO, BUT IF YOU WANT ME TO, I WILL. LOUISE... AND ANOTHER THING ABOUT YOUR MOTHER... LAY OFF MAMA, WILL YOU? I'M SORRY, GEORGE. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH. OH, AND WE DON'T NEED THIS OLD ADDRESS BOOK ANYMORE. WHO'S THIS GIRL? WHAT GIRL? THERE'S ONLY ONE GIRL IN THE PICTURE. OH, THAT GIRL? NOBODY. YOU CAN THROW THAT OUT. AIN'T NO SENSE CLUTTERING UP THE HOUSE WITH THAT. NO. I WANT TO KNOW WHO THIS CLUTTER IS. I TOLD YOU. I DON'T KNOW. WHY DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME? BECAUSE IT SAYS HERE, "TO GEORGE, WITH LOVE." WELL, THEN IT MUST BE ONE OF YOUR RELATIVES. I DON'T THINK SO, GEORGE. NOBODY IN MY FAMILY FEELS THAT WAY ABOUT YOU. LET ME SEE THAT AGAIN. OH, I REMEMBER HER. THAT'S HARRIET WHAT'S-HER-NAME. SOME GIRL I USED TO KNOW. HOW WELL DID YOU KNOW HER? I WENT OUT WITH HER A COUPLE TIMES. WAS NO BIG THING. YOU THE ONE I MARRIED. WHEN I WAS WITH HER, I WAS JUST PRACTICIN' UP FOR YOU. IT'S A PITY YOU DIDN'T TAKE MORE LESSONS. COME ON, WEEZY, THAT WAS BEFORE I EVEN KNEW YOU. I WENT OUT WITH LOTS OF GIRLS. BUT THIS IS THE ONLY GIRL WHOSE PICTURE YOU KEPT. WHY? OKAY, YOU WANNA KNOW THE TRUTH, THE WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH? SHE WAS MY FIRST GIRL. YOU KNOW HOW KIDS ARE. I THOUGHT I WAS IN LOVE. IT WAS A KIND OF SPECIAL TIME IN MY LIFE. YOU KNOW, A MAN LIKES TO LOOK BACK ON THINGS LIKE THAT. HONEST, WEEZY! I WAS GONNA THROW IT AWAY LOTS OF TIMES, BUT IT KEPT STICKIN' TO MY HAND. OKAY, GEORGE. I UNDERSTAND. WE'LL KEEP IT. NO, WE'LL THROW IT OUT. WHY? WELL, NOW THAT YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT, IT AIN'T NO FUN NO MORE. [Doorbell Rings] OH, THAT MUST BE TOM AND HELEN. [Groans] HELLO. OH, HI, MR. BENTLEY. COME IN. THANK YOU. FORGIVE MY POPPING IN THIS WAY, BUT... YOU NEVER POP IN ANY OTHER WAY, BENTLEY. GEORGE! DON'T MIND HIM, MR. BENTLEY. HE'S NOT FEELING WELL TODAY. OH, DEAR. HARD CHEESE, OLD MAN. PERHAPS I SHOULD POP OUT AND POP IN ANOTHER TIME, HUH? FORGET IT. SINCE YOU'RE ALREADY POPPED, LET'S HAVE THE HARD CHEESE AND GET IT OVER WITH. WELL, I'VE GOT THIS LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU, BUT YOU MUST CLOSE YOUR EYES. MR. BENTLEY, I THINK THIS IS THE WRONG TIME... LET'S CLOSE OUR EYES, LOUISE. MAYBE HE'LL DISAPPEAR. VOILÀ. VOILÀ. THAT MEANS YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES NOW. IT'S JUST A BUNCH OF ROLLS. NOT JUST ROLLS, MR. JEFFERSON. THESE ARE HOT CROSS BUNS. I BAKED THEM MYSELF AND I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE A BATCH. - WHAT KIND OF BUNS? - HOT CROSS. VERY POPULAR IN ENGLAND. HMM. A HOT CROSS IS VERY POPULAR WHERE I COME FROM TOO. WHAT? THANK YOU, MR. BENTLEY. IT WAS VERY CONSIDERATE OF YOU. WELL, I'M SORRY YOU'RE NOT FEELING BETTER, MR. JEFFERSON. WHAT IS IT, A TOUCH OF FLU? NO. HE'S GOT AN ULCER. AN ULCER? OH, YOU HAVE THE RICH MAN'S DISEASE. - SAY WHAT? - OH, YES. ULCERS ARE VERY POPULAR AMONG THE RICH, JUST LIKE GOUT. WELL, HOW RICH YOU GOT TO BE TO GET AN ULCER? OH, EXCEEDING RICH. YOU HEAR THAT, WEEZY? I GOT MY ULCER AHEAD OF TIME. IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT GOES WITH THE TERRITORY. BIG MONEY, BIGGER NEEDS. BIGGER NEEDS, HIGHER BLOOD PRESSURE. HIGHER BLOOD PRESSURE, WEAKER HEART. WEAKER HEART, TA-TA. ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY THAT I'M HEADING FOR TA-TA? IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOU HANDLE IT. NOW, YOU TAKE MY UNCLE CEDRIC. HE HAD A NAGGING WIFE AND FIVE NASTY CHILDREN. ON TOP OF THAT, HE HATED HIS BUSINESS. HE DEVELOPED AN ULCER AND THEN ONE DAY, HE WENT JUST LIKE THAT. HE DIED? NO, HE WENT. HE LEFT HOME. HE'S LIVING NOW ON AN ISLAND IN THE SOUTH SEAS. WHAT ABOUT HIS ULCER? OH, HE HASN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT IN YEARS. HE'S MUCH TOO BUSY TREATING HIS MALARIA. UH, MR. BENTLEY, COULD YOU GIVE ME THE RECIPE FOR THESE BUNS? GLADLY. THE SECRET, OF COURSE, IS TO MAKE YOUR OWN DOUGH. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT, ISN'T IT, MR. JEFFERSON? MR. BENTLEY, I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN YOUR RECIPE. I'M WORRIED ABOUT GEORGE. WHAT COULD BE THE CAUSE FOR HIS ULCER? WELL, SOME FORM OF STRESS, PROBABLY. CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING THAT'S BEEN AGGRAVATING HIM? WELL, I DON'T KNOW. GEORGE GETS UPSET WHEN I DISAGREE WITH HIM, WHEN I ARGUE WITH HIS MOTHER, WHEN I INVITE THE WILLISES OVER, LOTS OF THINGS. WELL, THEN THE ANSWER IS TO STOP DOING THOSE THINGS. YOU MUST TRY TO PROTECT HIM FROM ANYONE OR ANYTHING THAT CAUSES HIM AGGRAVATION. OH, GEORGE IS SO PROUD. IF HE FOUND OUT I WAS DOING THAT, IT WOULD MAKE HIM EVEN MORE UPSET. THEN DON'T TELL HIM. [George] LOUISE, COME HERE! IN A MINUTE, GEORGE! I'M BUSY! AH-AH. OH, YEAH. COMING, DEAR! WELL, GOOD-BYE, MR. JEFFERSON. I DO HOPE YOU'RE FEELING BETTER. REMEMBER, I'M RIGHT NEXT DOOR. IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, JUST CALL ON ME. - I WON'T. - OH, WELL, YOU NEVER KNOW. ULCERS CAN GO FROM BAD TO WORSE, YOU KNOW, AND WHEN YOURS DOES... AND YOU'RE IN EXCRUCIATING PAIN, I'LL DRIVE YOU TO THE HOSPITAL. SO YOU SEE, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. OH, WHAT IS IT, DEAR? IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU? YEAH. YOU CAN KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT. DON'T BE TELLING NOBODY I'M SICK. ANYTHING YOU SAY, GEORGE. [Doorbell Rings] AND I MEAN NOBODY, YOU HEAR? ALL RIGHT, GEORGE. JUST DON'T GET AGGRAVATED. HI, LOUISE. I'LL BET YOU CAN'T WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS ON YOUR TERRACE. - [Groans] - FORGET IT. WE'RE BUSY. WEEZY, YOU FEELING ALL RIGHT? I FEEL FINE. THEN IT MUST BE ME. I'M IN WORSE SHAPE THAN I THOUGHT I WAS. - WHAT? - AND MY EYES ARE GOING TOO. I COULD HAVE SWORN I SAW YOU SLAM THE DOOR ON THE ODD COUPLE. I DID. THEY'RE ALWAYS HANGING AROUND HERE. WE CAN DO WITHOUT THEM. YOU'RE CATCHING ON, WEEZY. I THINK I'LL JUST GO TAKE A NAP. GOOD IDEA. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE SOME WARM MILK WITH YOU? I'M GOING IN THERE TO LIE DOWN, NOT TO THROW UP. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT. I CAN BELIEVE IT. SHE ALMOST GOT MY NOSE. WELL, THAT'S THE LAST TIME SHE EVER SLAMS THE DOOR ON US. THERE MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG. NO, YOU JUST DIDN'T PUSH THE BUTTON FOR OUR FLOOR. I MEAN WITH LOUISE. SHE WOULD NEVER DO A THING LIKE THAT WITHOUT A GOOD REASON. MAYBE SHE'S TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING. I DON'T THINK SHE'S TRYING. I THINK SHE SUCCEEDED. BUT SHE MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE. MAYBE THERE'S A MANIAC IN THERE HOLDING A GUN ON HER. OH, GEORGE WOULDN'T DO THAT. I'M SERIOUS, TOM. [Doorbell Rings] LOUISE COULD BE IN DANGER. WHY ARE WE RINGING THE BELL AGAIN? WHY AREN'T WE CALLING THE POLICE? WE'D LOOK SILLY IF I'M WRONG. WE COULD LOOK DEAD IF YOU'RE RIGHT. TOM, HELEN, THANK GOODNESS YOU CAME BACK. COME IN, COME IN. YOU SURE IT'S ALL RIGHT? OF COURSE, IT'S ALL RIGHT. COME IN. YOU'RE, UM, ALONE? YES. GEORGE IS TAKING A NAP. NOTHING'S WRONG? OH, NO. OH, LOOK, I'M SORRY I SLAMMED THE DOOR ON YOU LIKE THAT. MAKE YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE WHILE I BRING OUT THE COFFEE. OH, WOULD YOU LIKE A HOT CROSS BUN? - NO, JUST AN EXPLANATION. - COMING UP. WEEZY, I THINK I'LL TAKE SOME COCOA. HI, GEORGE. WHAT'S GOING ON? GEORGE! HOW DID THEY GET IN HERE? I DON'T KNOW. THEY WAS ALREADY HERE WHEN I CAME OUT. HOW DID WE GET IN HERE? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I KNOW HOW WE GET OUT OF HERE. NO. HOLD IT, TOM. DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY TO US, LOUISE? - YES. BYE! - THAT'S IT. COME ON, HELEN. YOU HANDLED THAT REAL WELL, WEEZY. WHAT IS THAT? THAT'S A NEW LOUNGE CHAIR FOR THE TERRACE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT? WE DIDN'T NEED IT ANYWAY! I'LL GET YOUR COCOA, GEORGE. I JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO LOUISE. I THINK IT'S OBVIOUS. LIVING WITH GEORGE ALL THESE YEARS HAS FINALLY TAKEN ITS TOLL. WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? I MEAN SHE'S FLIPPED. SHE TURNED INTO A FEMALE GEORGE. THAT'S A HORRIBLE THING TO SAY. CAN YOU THINK OF SOMETHING ELSE? WELL, I KNOW THERE MUST BE AN EXPLANATION FOR HER BEHAVIOR. I'LL GIVE YOU ONE. SHE DOESN'T LIKE US. COULDN'T YOU SEE THERE WAS SOMETHING UPSETTING HER? SURE. OUR PRESENCE IN HER APARTMENT. OH, BE SENSIBLE, TOM. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO'S MAKING ANY SENSE AROUND HERE. EVERYONE ELSE HAS GONE CRAZY. DON'T CALL MY FRIEND CRAZY. IF YOU CAN'T SEE YOU'VE BEEN INSULTED, YOU'RE AS NUTS AS SHE IS. WHAT? NUTS. LET'S GO. NO. I'M NOT GETTING INTO THE SAME ELEVATOR WITH SOMEBODY WHO THINKS I'M NUTS. I'LL TAKE THE STAIRS, THANK YOU. OH, COME ON, HELEN. DON'T BE STUPID. STUPID? I'M TAKING THE STAIRS! NO, NO, YOU TAKE THE ELEVATOR. I'LL TAKE THE STAIRS. I AM TAKING THE STAIRS! OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT! I'M TAKING THE STAIRS! WHERE ARE YOU TAKING THE STAIRS? I MEAN, YOU WILL BRING THEM BACK, WON'T YOU? BECAUSE THEY'RE JOLLY USEFUL THINGS TO HAVE AROUND. IT WAS JUST A LITTLE JOKE. HERE'S YOUR COCOA, GEORGE. THANKS. I THINK I'LL JUST STRETCH RIGHT OUT HERE. HI, MOM. OH, HI, LIONEL. HELLO, MOTHER JEFFERSON. HOW WAS YOUR AFTERNOON? WONDERFUL. DO YOU KNOW THIS IS THE 15th YEAR... THAT I HAVE TAKEN LIONEL TO THE EASTER SHOW AT RADIO CITY? DID YOU ENJOY IT, LIONEL? OH, HE ALWAYS ENJOYS IT, DON'T YOU, LIONEL? YEAH, I GET A BIG KICK OUT OF THE ROCKETTES. AND WHAT ELSE DID YOU ENJOY? AH, COME ON, GRANDMA. GO AND TELL 'EM. WHAT ELSE DID YOU ENJOY, LIONEL? THE JUJUBEES YOU ALWAYS BUY ME. YOU DIDN'T FINISH THEM. LOUISE, YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE. THIS YEAR, THE STAGE SHOW WAS CALLED THE GLORY OF EASTER PAGEANT... AND BURT REYNOLDS WAS WONDERFUL. OH? WELL, WHAT DID BURT REYNOLDS PLAY? THE EASTER BUNNY? NO, NO, NO, MOM. SEE, HE WAS IN MOVIE. OH, WAS BURT REYNOLDS IN THE MOVIE TOO? POP, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME THIS TIME OF DAY? JUST RESTIN' UP. HOW YOU DOIN', MA? HELLO, GEORGE. GEORGE ISN'T FEELING TOO GOOD. OH, DEAR. WHAT'S THE MATTER, SON? OH, IT AIN'T NOTHING. JUST AN UPSET STOMACH. GEORGE, YOU REALLY GOT TO START EATING OUT MORE. MAMA, NOW, PLEASE DON'T... DON'T ARGUE WITH YOUR MOTHER. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, MOTHER JEFFERSON. UH, LIONEL, WILL YOU PLEASE GIVE ME A HAND IN THE KITCHEN? YEAH, SURE. GIVE ME STRENGTH. JUST GIVE ME STRENGTH. WHAT'S THE MATTER, MOM? LIONEL, THE FIRST CHANCE YOU GET, I WANT YOU TO GO UPSTAIRS... AND APOLOGIZE TO THE WILLISES FOR ME. FOR WHAT? I THREW THEM OUT OF THE HOUSE. YOU WHAT? I HAD TO. IT WAS UPSETTING YOUR FATHER, AND HE'S GOT AN ULCER. AN ULCER? SHH! NOBODY'S SUPPOSED TO KNOW IT. OH, OH. AN ULCER? YES. WHY DO YOU THINK I TOOK ALL THAT GUFF FROM YOUR GRANDMOTHER? SO YOUR FATHER WOULDN'T BE UPSET. WE'VE GOT TO PROTECT HIM AND KEEP HIM FROM THINGS THAT AGGRAVATE HIM. YOU MEAN YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE HOME? LIONEL! I'M SORRY. LOOK, WHAT GAVE HIM THE ULCER? OH, I THINK IT'S ALL THOSE BUSINESS WORRIES. ALL THAT STRESS AND STRAIN ISN'T GOOD FOR HIM. WELL, I DON'T KNOW. THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF STRESS. YOU KNOW, I WAS LISTENING TO THIS PSYCHIATRIST ON TV THE OTHER DAY, AND HE WAS SAYING THAT SOME KIND OF STRESS CAN BE GOOD FOR YOU. I MEAN, LIKE YOU COULD BE DRIVING YOURSELF HARD 24 HOURS A DAY, BUT IF YOU'RE ENJOYING IT, THEN THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL "JOYFUL STRESS." WELL, MAYBE YOUR FATHER ISN'T ENJOYING IT ANYMORE, AND THAT'S ULCER STRESS. SO JUST HELP ME KEEP THINGS COOL AROUND HERE, WILL YOU? OKAY, YOU MEAN THIS ISN'T THE TIME TO TELL HIM THAT JENNY'S PREGNANT? JENNY IS WHAT? SHH! GOT TO KEEP THINGS COOL, REMEMBER? OHH! [Phone Ringing] GET THAT FOR ME, WILL YOU, SON? OH, YEAH, OKAY. HELLO? WHO? OH, YEAH. WHAT? UH, HOLD ON. I'LL GET POP. IT'S MR. TAYLOR FROM THE STORE UP IN THE BRONX. HE'S GOT BIG TROUBLE. WHAT? RELAX, GEORGE. I'LL TAKE THAT. HELLO, MR. TAYLOR? THIS IS MRS. JEFFERSON. - OH, NO! - WHAT IS IT? OH, NOTHING, NOTHING. RELAX. GEORGE. YEAH, MA? MAYBE I OUGHT TO MOVE IN HERE FOR A FEW WEEKS... AND COOK SOME GOOD MEALS FOR YOU FOR A CHANGE. NO, YOU AIN'T GOTTA DO THAT. AFTER ALL, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE FOOD MAMA USED TO COOK. LOUISE ALREADY GIVES ME THAT KIND OF FOOD. I MEAN YOUR MAMA, NOT HER. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THE WHOLE STAFF WALKED OUT ON YOU? LOOK, MR. TAYLOR, MY HUSBAND ISN'T HERE, SO YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEM YOURSELF. LOOK, IT'S NOT MY FAULT YOUR AIR CONDITIONER'S BROKEN DOWN. NO, I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU CAN GET HELP ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. YES, I KNOW IT'LL COST A FORTUNE IF WE LOSE THE HOSPITAL CONTRACT. LOOK, I'LL CALL YOU BACK. MOM, ARE YOU OKAY? I THINK YOUR FATHER MIGHT BE CONTAGIOUS. IT COULD BE FOOD POISONING, LOUISE. NO, I DON'T FEEL THAT BAD. I'M TALKING ABOUT GEORGE. I THINK IT'S BECAUSE YOU USE THAT DISHWASHING MACHINE... INSTEAD OF SCRUBBING YOUR POTS AND PANS BY HAND LIKE I ALWAYS DID. I THINK THE MACHINE DOES THEM BETTER. THAT'S DEPENDS ON WHO'S DOING THE SCRUBBING. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. OH, MY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING... WITH THIS PICTURE OF HARRIET JOHNSON? OH, WE WERE JUST GOING THROUGH OLD PHOTOGRAPHS, AND GEORGE WANTS ME TO THROW IT OUT. DO YOU MIND IF I KEEP IT? - FOR WHAT? - AS A SOUVENIR OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. MAMA, NOW DON'T BE STARTIN' NOTHIN'. THEY MADE SUCH A LOVELY COUPLE. IS THAT SO? AND HARRIET WAS A GOOD COOK LIKE ME. OH, NOT THAT I'M CRITICIZING YOUR COOKING. I KNOW THAT. AND GEORGE'S FATHER NEVER HAD A STOMACHACHE ALL THE YEARS THAT WE WERE MARRIED. NO. ALL YOU GAVE HIM WAS A PAIN IN THE NECK. - LOUISE! - AND YOU HAVE GIVEN ME A PAIN SOMEWHERE ELSE! I DON'T HAVE TO STAND FOR THAT. THEN SIT DOWN! LOUISE, WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU? NOTHING NOW. I FEEL GREAT! THANK YOU, MOTHER JEFFERSON. YOU'RE WELCOME. LOUISE, WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO MAKE SOME COFFEE? THAT WOULD BE NICE. [Phone Ringing] HELLO. OH, YEAH, HOLD ON, MR. TAYLOR. OH, I'LL TAKE THAT, LIONEL. NO, I'LL TAKE IT. NO, GEORGE, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO GET AGGRAVATED! OKAY, THEN GIVE IT TO ME AND HUSH UP! TAYLOR? JEFFERSON SPEAKING. YEAH, GIVE IT TO ME. UH-HUH. UH-HUH. OKAY, NOW, THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. YOU KNOW THE HARDWARE STORE ON THE CORNER? WELL, YOU RENT SIX FANS FROM THEM. DON'T BE ARGUIN' WITH ME! GEORGE, DON'T GET SO EXCITED. THEN YOU CALL MY OTHER STORES. YES, ALL OF THEM! YOU TELL THEM TO SEND ONE GIRL FROM EACH STORE IN A TAXI TO YOUR PLACE FAST. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WHAT IF THEY DON'T WANT TO COME? YOU JUST PAY THEM DOUBLE TIME, AND THEY'LL GET THERE DOUBLE QUICK! YOU STILL WON'T MAKE THE DEADLINE? THE HELL YOU WON'T! YOU JUST CALL THE HOSPITAL, AND TELL THEM WE'LL DELIVER THE FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. DON'T BE ARGUING! JUST DO WHAT I SAY! WHAT'S THE USE OF MY TRYING TO HELP YOU... IF YOU'RE GOING AHEAD AND GETTING YOURSELF AGGRAVATED LIKE THAT? THAT AIN'T AGGRAVATION. THAT'S FUN. FUN? YEAH, SURE. HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M HUNGRY AS AN OX. YEAH, SEE, MOM? THAT'S WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT IN THE KITCHEN. HEY, POP, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF JOYFUL STRESS? YEAH, THAT'S ONE OF THEM GOSPEL SONGS LIKE "AMAZING GRACE." NO. NO, NO, SEE, THAT'S A WAY OF ENJOYING WORK PRESSURE, LIKE WHAT YOU JUST DID. AND, MOM, THE WAY YOU BLEW UP AT GRANDMA, YOU FELT BETTER RIGHT AWAY, RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT, I DID. IT'S HOLDING THINGS IN THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BAD. YOU KNOW, HE'S RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START SPREADIN' A LOT MORE JOYFUL STRESS AROUND HERE. SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT PAIN JUST TOOK THE TRAIN. AND IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES, THAT'S THE WAY I'M GONNA BE FROM NOW ON. WHAT WAY? NO HOLDING BACK. FROM NOW ON, I GONNA SAY EXACTLY WHAT I THINK. NO MORE MR. NICE GUY. GEORGE, I'VE BEEN THINKING. IT WILL BE BETTER IF I DO SLEEP HERE TONIGHT. MAMA, I... AND THAT WAY, I CAN MAKE YOU SOME OF MY NICE RICE PUDDING WITH WARM MILK. YOU WOULD LIKE THAT, WOULDN'T YOU, SON? MAMA... YOU WOULD, WOULDN'T YOU? YEAH, MAMA, THAT'D BE GREAT. [Groans] [Louise] THE JEFFERSONS WAS RECORDED ON TAPE IN FRONT OF A STUDIO AUDIENCE. ♪ MOVIN', MOVIN' ON UP ♪♪
