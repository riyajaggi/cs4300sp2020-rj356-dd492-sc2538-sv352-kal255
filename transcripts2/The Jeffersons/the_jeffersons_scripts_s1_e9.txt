CAN'T BE NOTHIN' BUT A HONKY. - WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT? - BECAUSE A WHITE WINO... IS TURNED OVER TO THE SALVATION ARMY; THEY CALL HIM AN "INDIGENT." A BLACK WINO IS BUSTED AND THEY CALL HIM AN "INMATE." ANYHOW, IT SAYS RIGHT HERE, SINCE THAT HAPPENED, HIS BUSINESS HAS TRIPLED. IT WAS THE PUBLICITY THAT DID IT. THEN WHY DON'T YOU ADVERTISE? BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BUY THAT KIND OF ADVERTISING. IF I COULD, I'D BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST BLACK BUSINESSMEN IN NEW YORK. LIKE THIS DUDE HERE IN THIS PAPER? WHAT DUDE? HAVEN'T YOU BEEN READING THIS SERIES? IT'S ON SUCCESSFUL BLACK BUSINESSMEN AROUND HERE. TODAY IT'S ABOUT A DUDE WHO OWNS GOLDMAN PHARMACIES. HE'S A MILLIONAIRE. GOLDMAN?

I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE. NO, I AIN'T. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. ONE THING I LEARNED IN LIFE, YOU GOT TO BLOW YOUR OWN HORN. AND YOU'VE GOT THE HOT AIR TO DO IT.

YOU'RE INVITING THE WILLISES? YOU WHO KEEPS SAYING... YOU DON'T WANT THAT ZEBRA MARRIAGE HANGING AROUND? I DON'T, BUT I NEED 'EM TONIGHT. YOU KNOW, AND THOSE PHONY LIBERAL WRITERS ARE ALL FOR MIXING THE RACES. THAT'S NOT HONEST. THAT MAKES YOU A HYPOCRITE. IT'S ONLY FOR A COUPLE HOURS. AFTER THE PARTY, I'LL BE JUST AS HONEST AS I ALWAYS AM. OKAY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO GET YOUR MILLIONAIRES? INVITE SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS. THE REPORTER AIN'T GONNA KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. WHAT'S HE GONNA DO? ASK TO SEE THEIR BANKBOOKS? [Phone Rings] YOU'LL BE LUCKY TO GET ANYONE TO COME ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. HELLO. OH, HI, MOM. HUH? OH, NO, IT'S JUST THAT I WAS BUSY, THAT'S ALL.

WE HAVEN'T BEEN SEEING ENOUGH OF YOU TWO LATELY. EITHER WE'RE IN THE WRONG APARTMENT, OR HE'S UP TO SOMETHING. - HE'S UP TO SOMETHING. - WE'RE GOOD NEIGHBORS. WHAT'S HAPPENING? WE WERE HOPING TO TALK TO LOUISE ABOUT OUR ANNUAL CHARITY AFFAIR. OH, WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO BOTH OF US TONIGHT OVER COCKTAILS, SAY ABOUT 6:30? - YOU'RE INVITING US TO COCKTAILS? - WHAT'S SO STRANGE ABOUT THAT? NO STRANGER THAN WILT CHAMBERLAIN BUYING ELEVATOR SHOES. IT'S SOME KIND OF SETUP. WE WALK IN, AND YOU HAVE US ARRESTED AS HOUSEBREAKERS. I'M TRYING TO BE FRIENDLY. WAIT A MINUTE. JUST HOW BAD DO YOU WANT US? I INVITED YOU, DIDN'T I? WELL, WE JUST HAVE JUST TWO TICKETS LEFT TO OUR DINNER DANCE NEXT WEEK. WE WERE HOPING YOU AND LOUISE... HELEN, THAT'S BLACKMAIL.

IN THE HOSPITAL IN THE BRONX. LOOK, I'M TRYING TO JAZZ UP THE STORY. I WANNA SHOW HOW A BOY FROM THE GHETTO... GOT HIS FIRST CLEANING STORE THROUGH HARD WORK, SKIMPING AND SAVING... AND A $5,000 WHIPLASH SETTLEMENT FROM THE CITY OF NEW YORK. THAT'S WHAT I CALL JAZZING DOWN THE STORY. [Snoring] WHAT'S THAT? YOUR MOTHER. SHE'S TAKING A NAP. IT ALL STARTED 45 YEARS AGO. MR. JEFFERSON? CAN'T YOU SEE I'M BUSY? NO. I THOUGHT YOU WAS JUST TALKING. WHAT DO YOU WANT? WELL, THIS AIN'T GONNA WORK, MR. JEFFERSON. I'M A CLEANING MAID. I AIN'T USED TO SERVING. WE KNOW THAT, BUT NOW YOU'RE MOVING UP IN THE WORLD. WELL, I DON'T MIND MOVING UP IN THE WORLD, MR. JEFFERSON, BUT YOU KNOW HOW YOU ACT SOMETIMES. AND I DON'T WANT YOU GETTING MAD AT ME LIKE YOU DID AT THAT LAST PARTY. THAT'S WHAT GAVE ME MY LARYNGITIS. DON'T BE NERVOUS, FLORENCE. GEORGE IS OUT TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION TONIGHT, SO HE'S NOT GOING TO BE HIMSELF. HE'S GOING TO BE A PERFECT GENTLEMAN. WELL, OKAY, I'LL TRY. AT 2.50 AND HOUR, YOU BETTER DO BETTER THAN TRY. - $4.00 AN HOUR, GEORGE. - SINCE WHEN? SINCE SHE'S MOVING UP IN THE WORLD. FLORENCE, YOU CAN PUT THE PIZZA PUFFS IN THE OVEN AS SOON THE GUESTS ARRIVE, WHICH SHOULD BE ANY MINUTE NOW. - ALL RIGHT, MRS. JEFFERSON. - AT THESE PRICES, I WANNA SEE SOME FANCY MAIDING. EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND, I WANT TO SEE YOU SERVING SOMETHING. YES, MR. JEFFERSON. STOP PICKING ON HER, GEORGE. THIS WHOLE THING IS SILLY ANYWAY. HIRING A MAID FOR JUST FIVE PEOPLE. [Doorbell Rings] SIX. DON'T FORGET MAMA. I WISH I COULD. MR. JEFFERSON? MIKE MORENO, EAST SIDE CHRONICLE. AH, YES, COME IN, COME IN. I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MY WIFE LOUISE. IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE. HOW ARE YOU? HOW DO YOU DO? WON'T YOU SIT DOWN? OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CAN I GET YOU A DRINK, MR. MORENO? NO, THANKS. I'VE GOT TO COVER A CONCERT AT THE LINCOLN CENTER RIGHT AFTER THIS. I THOUGHT YOU SAID THERE WAS GOING TO BE OTHER GUESTS. OH, THEY'LL BE HERE. RICH PEOPLE ALWAYS COME LATE. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW THEY'RE RICH. I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TIME, SO WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GET STARTED? RIGHT. [Clears Throat] IT ALL STARTED 45 YEARS AGO, - AND I WAS JUST A LITTLE... - MEATBALL? AS I WAS SAYING, IT ALL STARTED... OH, HOW ABOUT YOU, MRS. JEFFERSON? OH, THANK YOU, FLORENCE. NOW, GETTING BACK TO THE STORY. FORTY-FIVE YEARS AGO, A WOMAN WENT INTO THE COTTON FIELD IN ALABAMA. WHEN SHE CAME OUT, SHE BROUGHT WITH HER... CLAM DIP? CHEESE PUFF? WHY DON'T YOU STOP HANGING AROUND OUT HERE? - YOU SAID EVERY TIME... - DON'T DO WHAT I SAID. DO WHAT I SAY. IT'S SO HARD TO GET GOOD HELP THESE DAYS. OKAY. I GATHER YOU WERE BORN 45 YEARS AGO. YEAH, AND IT WAS A LONG, TOUGH CLIMB... FROM THAT RAT-INFESTED TENEMENT I GREW UP IN. WE DIDN'T HAVE RATS, GEORGE. A FEW MICE, MAYBE, BUT NO RATS. OH, MAMA, MEET MIKE MORENO. HOW DO YOU DO? FINE, THANK YOU, ONLY THAT BLOODY MARY MADE ME SO SLEEPY, I ALMOST NODDED OFF. YES, YOU'VE BEEN ALMOST NODDING OFF FOR TWO-AND-A-HALF HOURS NOW. MAYBE I BETTER HAVE ANOTHER. THE SECOND ONE ALWAYS PERKS ME UP. NOW, WHAT DO WE GOT SO FAR? NOTHING, EXCEPT YOU'RE 45 YEARS OLD. FORTY-SIX. I WAS 45 WHEN I STARTED TELLING THIS STORY. [Doorbell Rings] DON'T PUT THAT PENCIL DOWN. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OH, HELLO! I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU. WE KNEW THAT, BUT WE DECIDED TO COME ANYWAY. COME IN. MEET MIKE MORENO. THIS IS TOM AND HELEN WILLIS. HOW ARE YOU? HOW DO YOU DO? MR. WILLIS, A PLEASURE MEETING YOU. TOM, IT WAS NICE OF YOU TO TAKE TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE... TO BE HERE TONIGHT. I WOULDN'T HAVE MISSED THIS FOR THE WORLD. IT PAYS TO VISIT YOU, GEORGE. TOM HERE IS A BIG PUBLISHER. WELL, ACTUALLY, I'M JUST A SENIOR EDITOR WITH PELHAM PUBLISHING. WELL, I'M VERY GLAD TO MEET YOU. I'M WRITING A BOOK, YOU KNOW. OH, REALLY? YES. YOU SEE, I'M NEWSPAPERMAN. HE'S HERE TO DO A STORY ABOUT ME. I GOT THE IDEA FOR MY BOOK... FROM THIS SERIES I BEEN WRITING ON BLACK CAPITALISM. WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS RESPONSE FROM OUR READERS. I CAN SEE WHY. THE TIME IS RIGHT FOR A BOOK LIKE THAT. BUT HE AIN'T INTERESTED IN THAT RIGHT NOW. HE'S HERE TO DO A STORY ABOUT ME. SO WHY DON'T YOU TWO GO OVER THERE AND MAKE YOURSELVES A DRINK? - I CAN GET THAT, MR. JEFFERSON. - YOU CAN GET YOURSELF BACK IN THE KITCHEN. - BUT I THOUGHT YOU SAID... - DON'T THINK! I DO THE THINKING. WELL, THINK ABOUT GETTING YOURSELF ANOTHER MAID! LOUISE, WOULD YOU PLEASE GO AND SEE WHAT'S BOTHERING THAT YOUNG LADY? I DON'T HAVE TO. I'M LOOKING AT IT. WHY DON'T WE JUST START FROM THE BEGINNING? GOOD IDEA. LET'S GO CLEAR BACK TO WHERE YOU ASKED ME IF I WANTED A DRINK AND I SAID NO. I CHANGED MY MIND. I'D LOVE ONE. SURE. WHAT'LL YOU HAVE? OH, DON'T BOTHER. I CAN GET IT MYSELF. YOU KNOW, MR. WILLIS, IN THIS BOOK I'M WRITING, I'M NOT DEALING WITH YOUR ORDINARY BLACK BUSINESSMAN. THE PEOPLE I WANT ARE BANKERS, CORPORATE EXECUTIVES. THEN YOU OUGHT TO MEET HELEN'S FATHER. HE'S A CORPORATE EXECUTIVE. AND BELIEVE ME, HE'S A CHARACTER. WHO IS HE? DID YOU EVER HEAR OF BUTEX INDUSTRIES? AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE? THAT'S THE ONE. MY FATHER'S COMPANY PRESIDENT. WELL, THAT'S FASCINATING. I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOUR FATHER. WELL, MY FATHER WAS VERY, VERY POOR. WE NEVER HAD NOTHING AS KIDS. IT WAS TOUGH FOR MY FATHER TO FIND A JOB IN THOSE DAYS. OH, THAT'S SAD. HOW DID YOUR FATHER GET HIS START? HE INHERITED A FARM FROM MY GRANDFATHER. OH, TELL HIM ABOUT YOUR GRANDFATHER, HELEN, HOW HE TURNED A SMALL, ROCKY PIECE OF LAND INTO A RICH FARM. HE STARTED WITH ONE ACRE AND WOUND UP OWNING HUNDREDS. THAT'S KIND OF LIKE MY STORY. I STARTED OUT WITH ONE RUNDOWN CLEANING PLANT IN QUEENS... BUT THAT'S SUCH A LONG STORY. WHO ASKED YOU? I WAS TALKING TO TOM. GOOD. WELL, YOU KEEP TALKING TO HIM. I KNOW YOU'RE ANXIOUS TO GET TO MY STORY, SO LET'S GET GOING. FORTY-FIVE YEARS AGO, A WOMAN WENT INTO THE COTTON FIELD IN ALABAMA. AND WHEN SHE CAME... GEORGE, I THINK I'LL TAKE A NAP. AGAIN? THAT BLOODY MARY MADE ME DIZZY. YOU TELL LOUISE SHE'S BUYING THE WRONG KIND OF TOMATO JUICE. WHERE WERE WE? IN A COTTON FIELD. OH, RIGHT. WELL, THIS... [Doorbell Rings] FLORENCE, GET THE DOOR! - YOU TOLD ME TO STAY IN THE KITCHEN! - GET THE DOOR! JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE BOSS DON'T MEAN YOU GOT TO BE SO LAZY. YOU'RE CLOSER TO THE DOOR THAN I AM! YOU COULD'VE HAD IT OPENED, ANSWERED AND SHUT BEFORE I EVEN GOT NEAR IT! GOOD EVENING. MRS. JEFFERSON, IT'S THAT WEIRDO AND A FOX. IT'S MR. BENTLEY FROM THE U.N. HI THERE, BENTLEY. EVENING, MR. JEFFERSON. ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE MISS TANYA PETROVICH. SHE JUST ARRIVED FROM RUSSIA THIS AFTERNOON. MR. JEFFERSON, I WAS SO EXCITED... WHEN COMRADE BENTLEY TOLD ME WE WERE COMING HERE. SO, THIS IS BLACK GHETTO. WHY IS EVERYONE TRYING TO GET OUT? EVERYBODY, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET... YES, YES! NICE TO MEET YOU. AND YOU MUST BE MRS. JEFFERSON. - NO, NO, NO. I'M AFRAID... - AFRAID? OF COURSE YOU ARE AFRAID. IN SOVIET UNION, WE HAVE HEARD MUCH ABOUT POOR, DOWNTRODDEN BLACKS. HMM! YOU'RE TALKIN' TO THE WRONG DOWNTRODDEN BLACK, HONEY. THIS IS MRS. JEFFERSON. I'M HELEN WILLIS, AND THIS IS MY HUSBAND TOM. MRS. JEFFERSON, I WOULD KNOW YOU ANYWHERE. YOU WOULD? TWENTY-FIVE YEARS BEING MARRIED TO GEORGE HAS FINALLY CAUGHT UP WITH ME. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING TO EAT? PLEASE. NOT TO SPEAK OF FOOD. YES, I'M AFRAID TANYA HAD A VERY ROUGH FLIGHT. SHE WAS AIRSICK ALL THE WAY. IT WAS THE SEAFOOD THAT DID IT. JUST THINKING ABOUT IT MAKES ME NAUSEOUS. WOULD YOU LIKE SOME CLAM DIP? NYET! NYET! OH, THIS AIN'T BAD. BUT WATCH OUT FOR THEM PIZZA PUFFS. THEY TASTE LIKE HOT RUBBER BANDS. PLEASE. SOME VODKA? AH, YES, MAKE IT TWO, NEAT. EVERY TIME I FLY, I GET AIRSICK. NOT LIKE HIM! HE CROSSED THE ATLANTIC IN SAILBOAT. DID YOU EVER HEAR OF ANYTHING SO CRAZY? THAT WASN'T ME, ACTUALLY. IT WAS MY BROTHER NIGEL. IN A SAILBOAT? THAT'S FANTASTIC. THAT AIN'T NOTHIN'. I CROSSED THE PACIFIC IN AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER. I'M AN OLD NAVY MAN, YOU KNOW. YOUR BROTHER ACTUALLY CROSSED THE ATLANTIC IN A SAILBOAT? OH, YES. NOT ONCE, BUT THREE TIMES. UNFORTUNATELY, HE ONLY MADE IT TWICE. - OH. - LUCKILY, IT WAS THE FIRST AND THE THIRD TIME. BUT THE SECOND CROSSING WAS A BIT OF A STICKY WICKET. [Chuckles] YES. HE WAS ALONE, EXCEPT FOR ELOISE. SHE WAS PREGGERS AT THE TIME. HE TOOK HIS PREGNANT WIFE WITH HIM? - OH, ELOISE WASN'T HIS WIFE. - OH. NO. SHE WAS HIS SIAMESE CAT. - OH? - YES. HE NEVER MADE A TRIP WITHOUT HER. ANYWAY, THEY RAN INTO THIS HURRICANE, AND THEY LOST THEIR MAST AND SAILS, AND THEY DRIFTED AROUND FOR DAYS WITHOUT ANY FOOD. FINALLY, THEY WERE RESCUED BY A NORWEGIAN SARDINE BOAT. WHEN THEY PULLED INTO NEW YORK HARBOR, ELOISE WEIGHED 53 POUNDS. I'D LIKE TO MEET THIS CRAZY BROTHER OF YOURS. YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE... BECAUSE HE'S FLYING INTO NEW YORK NEXT WEEK TO BEGIN HIS NEW ADVENTURE. - REALLY? WHAT IS THAT? - HE PLANS TO PADDLE A CANOE FROM HERE TO MIAMI BEACH. - WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? - HE LOVES SUNSHINE. THAT'D MAKE A FANTASTIC STORY. I WISH I COULD HEAR MORE, BUT I DO HAVE TO LEAVE. WOULD YOU ASK YOUR BROTHER TO CALL ME? MY PLEASURE. AND YOU TOO, MRS. WILLIS. I WANNA GET ALL THE DETAILS STRAIGHT. THOSE STORIES YOU TOLD ME WILL MAKE GREAT FEATURES FOR MY PAPER. WELL, GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY. KEEP ON TRUCKIN'. RIGHT. WELL... HOLD IT. AIN'T YOU FORGETTING SOMETHING? I DON'T THINK SO. I'VE GOT MY PAD HERE... NO, WHAT ABOUT ME? OF COURSE. THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME. I GOT A LINE ON TWO GREAT STORIES: MRS. WILLIS'S FATHER AND MR. BENTLEY'S BROTHER. VERY GOOD. AIN'T YOU ONE STORY SHORT? I OWN A CHAIN OF FIVE CLEANING STORES, STARTED OUT WITH NOTHING. I ONLY NEED ONE MORE ARTICLE FOR MY SERIES ON BLACK BUSINESSMEN, AND MRS. WILLIS'S FATHER IS... I MEAN, THAT'S A FANTASTIC STORY. WHAT ABOUT ME? AND MR. BENTLEY'S BROTHER, THAT'S A FANTASTIC STORY! BUT I INVITED YOU HERE! DON'T THINK I'M NOT GRATEFUL. DON'T WORRY. I'LL MENTION THAT I GOT THE STORY AT YOUR PARTY. YOUR NAME WILL BE RIGHT IN THERE, MR. JEFFRIES. WELL, I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE GOING TOO. NO! NOBODY'S GOING NO PLACE! WHY NOT? WE STAYED OUR $100 WORTH. SIT DOWN! I GOT SOMETHING I WANT EVERYBODY TO HEAR! EVERYBODY SIT DOWN! SIT DOWN! NOW, REALLY, GEORGE... YOU TOO, LOUISE, SIT DOWN.
