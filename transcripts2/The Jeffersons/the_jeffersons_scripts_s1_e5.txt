 George likes the idea of boosting his classy ans luxurious image, so he asks Louise to purchase a piano for their home, despite knowing that no one around can play one.

 SOME OF 'EM EVEN EAT WATERMELON. IT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE EATING. IT'S THE TIME WE'RE EATING IT. 11:00 ON A SUNDAY MORNING AND WE'RE JUST HAVING BREAKFAST. THAT'S SINFUL. NO, IT AIN'T 'CAUSE THIS AIN'T BREAKFAST. IT'S BRUNCH. - BRUNCH? - THE RICH FOLKS INVENTED IT... SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING UP TOO LATE FOR BREAKFAST... OR TOO EARLY FOR LUNCH, SO THEY CALL IT BRUNCH. WHAT DO WE EAT IF WE DON'T GET UP UNTIL THE AFTERNOON? "DINCH"? THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA, WEEZY. THAT'S HOW RICH FOLKS GET MORE TIME TO ENJOY THEIR MONEY... BECAUSE THEY MAKE ONE MEAL DO THE WORK OF TWO; I CALL THAT SMART. WHEN WE HAD TO DO IT IN HARLEM, IT WAS CALLED POVERTY. YOU KNOW SOMETHING? I BET YOU MY BANKER, H.L. WHITTENDALE, IS HAVING HIS BRUNCH RIGHT NOW, UP THERE IN THE PENTHOUSE. YOU KNOW SOMETHING ELSE? HIS CHAUFFEUR TOLD ME... HE ALWAYS EATS EGGS BENEDICT EVERY MORNING. THAT'S CLASS. THIS MIGHT COME AS A SHOCK TO YOU, BUT I DON'T CARE IF WHITTENDALE EATS SHREDDED WHEAT THROUGH A STRAW. WELL, YOU SHOULD CARE 'CAUSE I CARE. I WANT THE NAME GEORGE JEFFERSON TO BE A NAME H.L. WHITTENDALE WILL NEVER FORGET. I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING YOU TALK ABOUT WHITTENDALE. H.L. WHITTENDALE IS HEAD OF WHITTENDALE NATIONAL BANK, LOUISE, AND... HE COULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND MY BUSINESS. AND LIVING HERE IS A GREAT CHANCE TO GET TO MEET HIM. SEE? EVEN YOU AGREE. HAS IT EVER OCCURRED TO YOU, GEORGE, THAT WHITTENDALE MIGHT NOT WANNA MEET YOU? THAT'S RIDICULOUS, WEEZY. LOOK, WE'RE AT A NEW STATION IN LIFE. SO WHY DON'T YOU STOP KNOCKING IT AND BRING OUT SOME MORE BAGELS? I'M NOT KNOCKING IT. BUT I'VE GOT TO KEEP REMEMBERING WHO I AM. I DON'T MIND LIVING UP TO OUR MONEY ALL WEEK, BUT I'VE GOTTA HAVE SUNDAYS OFF. ONE DAY A WEEK, I'VE GOT TO BE TRUE TO MY ROOTS... TO RELAX AND BE ME. ♪ HAVA NAGILA ♪ ♪ HAVA NAGILA ♪♪ HEY, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE WE NEED FOR OUR NEW STATION. YOU SEEN THESE PICTURES OF THEM RICH FOLKS' HOMES? UH-HUH. LOOK AT THIS PICTURE. YOU NOTICE ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE FURNITURE? YEAH. IT LOOKS LIKE NOBODY EVER SITS ON IT. I DON'T MEAN THAT. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PICTURE. WHAT'S SITTING IN THAT LIVING ROOM WITH THE GLEAMING WHITE TEETH... THAT WE AIN'T GOT HERE? LIBERACE. I MEAN, WHAT'S LIBERACE GOT THAT WE AIN'T GOT? A CLOSET FULL OF CANDLES? HE'S GOT A PIANO. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED... A PIANO. WEEZY, YOU'LL LOVE IT. SEE HOW GOOD A PIANO MAKES THEM PLACES LOOK? YES, BUT THOSE ARE BIG HOMES. THAT'S OLD MONEY, GEORGE. SO? THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OLD MONEY AND NEW MONEY... IS THAT THE NEW MONEY CRACKLES MORE. WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE IF PEOPLE CAN'T SEE YOU'VE GOT IT, THEY CAN HEAR YOU'VE GOT IT. WHY BOTHER TO BUY A PIANO? JUST HANG UP A FRAMED PICTURE OF YOUR BANK BALANCE. NO, THAT WOULD BE SHOWING OFF. SEE, A PIANO WOULD BRING REAL CLASS TO THIS PLACE. THAT'S GREAT. NOW WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO FOR AN ENCORE? ANSWER THE DOOR. GOOD MORNING. HI, BENTLEY. WHAT DID YOU DO, LOCK YOURSELF OUT IN YOUR DOCTOR DENTONS? THESE AREN'T MY PAJAMAS. I'VE BEEN JOGGING. MAY I COME IN? ONLY IF YOU TURN OFF YOUR MOTOR. COME IN, MR. BENTLEY. THANK YOU. THAT'S THE FUNNY PART ABOUT GOING FOR A RUN. AFTER YOU'VE FINISHED RUNNING, YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP RUNNING BEFORE YOU CAN STOP RUNNING. SOMETHING TO DO WITH LETTING THE MUSCLES UNWIND. IT'S THE, UH, SUDDEN STOP THAT CAN HURT YOU. INCIDENTALLY, DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT MAN... WHO FELL FROM THE 89th FLOOR OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING... - AND LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT? - NO. YES. HE TOLD THE PEOPLE ON THE 88th FLOOR, THE 87th FLOOR, THE 86th FLOOR... UH, WOULD YOU LIKE SOME COFFEE AND A BAGEL? BAGELS. MARVELOUS. YOU DON'T MIND IF I TAKE THIS WITH ME? I JUST POPPED IN TO TELL YOU THAT THE WILLISES ARE THINKING... OF HOLDING A TENANTS' PROTEST MEETING, AND WE WERE WONDERING IF YOU'D CARE TO COME. I AIN'T GETTING INVOLVED IN NO PROTESTS. - BUT, GEORGE... - NO WAY, LOUISE. WE CAN AFFORD TO SIT BACK AND WATCH WHITEY DOING THE MARCHING FOR A CHANGE. WELL, I DON'T THINK IT'S A MARCH, JUST A STAND-UP BUFFET. WE JUST MOVED INTO THE BUILDING, AND I DON'T WANNA MAKE NO WAVES. BESIDES, WE AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO PROTEST ABOUT. YOU HAPPY HERE, AIN'T YOU? YES, BUT PEOPLE SHOULD STICK TOGETHER. YOU STICK TOGETHER WHEN YOU'RE SUFFERING. WE ALREADY DONE OUR SUFFERING. I SEE YOUR POINT. WELL, NOT TO WORRY. UH-OH. THERE'S A NEW ONE. WHAT'S THAT MEAN? WELL, THAT'S RUSSIAN FOR... WHICH, OF COURSE, IS FRENCH FOR... I THINK YOU COULD AT LEAST HAVE LISTENED TO HIM. HE SPEAKS FIVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AND DON'T SAY NOTHING IN ALL OF 'EM. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT DUDE WHEN HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE TALKING ENGLISH. AND SOMETIMES I UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER THAN I DO YOU. WELL, UNDERSTAND THIS. I JUST GOT ME A BRAND-NEW THREE-YEAR APARTMENT LEASE, AND I AIN'T MAKING NO WAVES. BUT, GEORGE... I DON'T WANT YOU JUMPING IN THOSE MEETINGS NEITHER BECAUSE YOU'D MAKE A TIDAL WAVE. NOW, YOU WATCH IT, GEORGE. ALL RIGHT, LOUISE, CALM DOWN. I'M SORRY. SIT DOWN. ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY IS WE SHOULD JUST TRY TO PLAY IT COOL FOR A WHILE. THIS IS A GREAT APARTMENT, AIN'T IT? OF COURSE IT IS. AND WHEN WE GET OUR PIANO, IT'S GONNA BE EVEN BETTER. YOU STILL ON THAT? SURE. ALL RICH FOLKS GOT PIANOS. HOW COME WE AIN'T GOT ONE? MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE NOBODY AROUND HERE CAN PLAY ONE. WE GOT A FANCY FRENCH WRITING DESK... AND NOBODY AROUND HERE WRITES FRENCH NEITHER. WE DON'T NEED A PIANO. SURE WE DO. SEE, WEEZY, THAT'S YOUR TROUBLE. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SENSE OF VALUES. THE IMPORTANT THING IS NOT TO BE ABLE TO PLAY IT. IT'S TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT. SO, YOU'RE GONNA ORDER US A PIANO FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BUYING PIANOS. WHAT'S TO KNOW? YOU JUST PHONE UP AND ORDER THE BEST ONE IN THE STORE. OKAY, I'LL ORDER YOUR PIANO. MAYBE WE'LL GET A DISCOUNT IF I TELL THEM IT'S JUST FOR LOOKING AT. HELLO. OH, HI. - IT'S HELEN WILLIS, GEORGE. - OH! NOW GIVE ME THE GOOD NEWS. WHY, HELLO, GEORGE. I THOUGHT YOU'D BE IN CHURCH... PRAYING FOR A FULL RETURN TO MENTAL HEALTH. ANYWAY, LOUISE, A FEW OF THE TENANTS IN THE BUILDING... ARE GETTING TOGETHER TO HAVE A MEETING... OH, THE PROTEST MEETING. BENTLEY ALREADY LAID THAT ON US. UH-OH. MORE BAD NEWS. WHAT DO YOU WANT? I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO MY WIFE IF YOU DON'T MIND. HELEN, I CAN'T FIND MY FOUNTAIN PEN. USE ONE OF THE BALLPOINT PENS. THERE ARE LOTS OF THEM ON YOUR DESK. BALLPOINT PENS ARE NOT FOR WRITING. THEY'RE FOR MAKING MARKS. I NEED A PEN WITH A POINT. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH MY PEN? I DON'T KNOW. I MIGHT HAVE TAKEN IT TO DO THE MARKETING LIST. YOU WROTE WITH IT? WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WITH A PEN? PAINT THE WALLS? DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT A STRANGE HAND CAN DO TO THE NIB? THEY DON'T MAKE NIBS LIKE THAT ANYMORE. LOOK, YOU TWO. I DON'T LIKE NO ARGUMENTS IN MY HOUSE. WHAT? YOU STAY OUT OF THIS, LOUISE. IF YOU WANNA HAVE AN ARGUMENT, YOU TAKE IT UPSTAIRS TO YOUR OWN APARTMENT WHERE IT BELONGS. JUST AS SOON AS I FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PEN. WHERE IS IT? IT'S AROUND. MAYBE IN THE KITCHEN. AND I BETTER FIND IT OR I'M GONNA TURN THAT APARTMENT UPSIDE DOWN. TOM, YOU'RE JUST BEING PLAIN SILLY. NO, I'M NOT. I HAVE TO DO MY WORK NOW. I'M READY TO DO MY WORK NOW, BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE OF YOU. YOU JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE? YOU ARE A... UH-OH. HERE IT COMES. HE'S GONNA SAY IT NOW. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I'M GONNA SAY IT. YOU ARE A WOMAN, A TYPICAL WOMAN. THAT'S A TERRIBLE THING TO SAY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S SO TERRIBLE. I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA CALL HER A... GEORGE! I'M JUST A TERRIBLE WIFE. THAT'S WHAT I AM, HUH? YOU BET YOU ARE. AND YOU COULD BE IN BIG TROUBLE IF I DIDN'T LOVE YOU SO MUCH. BIG TROUBLE. HOW ABOUT YOU GOING WITH HIM? I'LL LEAVE AS SOON AS I GET YOUR ANSWER ABOUT THE PROTEST MEETING. SHALL WE COUNT YOU IN? NO. YOU CAN COUNT ME OUT. I DON'T WANT NO PART OF IT. BUT THE MORE SUPPORT WE GET, THE BETTER. THE PARKING RATES IN THE GARAGE ARE GOING UP 25 PERCENT. WHO CARES? I AIN'T GOT NO CAR. BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING. TAKE SECURITY. THEY'RE LETTING THE NIGHT DOORMAN GO. I AIN'T SURPRISED. LAST TIME I SAW THE NIGHT DOORMAN, HE WAS SO STONED I HAD TO SHOW HIM WHERE THE DOOR WAS. THEY'RE CUTTING DOWN ON SERVICES ANY WAY THEY CAN. THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY WHO'S IMPORTANT IN THIS BUILDING... YOU FOLKS, THE McALLISTERS, THE LACHMANS, THE WHITTENDALES, THE NELSONS... DID YOU SAY WHITTENDALE? THE BANKER? YEAH. WE INVITED HIM TOO. WE'RE INVITING EVERYBODY... WHO'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROBLEMS IN THE BUILDING. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE. WE DO HAVE PROBLEMS IN THIS BUILDING. BIG PROBLEMS. COME ON, GEORGE. YOU JUST SAID WE HAD NO PROBLEMS AT ALL. THAT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA WORRY YOU. WE GOT LOTS OF TROUBLE. THIS APARTMENT HAPPENS TO BE THE APARTMENT... WHICH NEEDS MORE ATTENTION THAN ALL THE OTHERS PUT TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY I THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE THE MEETING RIGHT HERE. YOU MEAN YOU WANNA HOLD THAT MEETING HERE? SURE. AND SHOW THEM HOW TO DO IT IN STYLE. FREE FOOD, FREE BOOZE AND FREE MUSIC... ON OUR BRAND-NEW LITTLE OLD PIANO. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT ELSE I'M GONNA DO FOR YOU. JUST GIVE ME THOSE INVITATIONS AND I'LL PUT MY OWN PERSONAL P.S. ON IT... TO MAKE SURE WHITTENDALE COMES. I HEAR IT, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT. YOU CAN BELIEVE IT. SURE. I ALWAYS SAY, IF YOU WANNA GET ANYWHERE, YOU GOTTA MAKE WAVES. RIGHT, WEEZY? DOORBELL, MRS. JEFFERSON! I'LL GET IT! EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. OOH! GOOD EVENING. WE'RE THE NELSONS. MR. AND MRS. NELSON! HOW DO YOU DO? WON'T YOU COME IN. IT'S SO NICE OF YOU TO HAVE A PARTY. HOW ARE YOU? THE FOOD IS RIGHT OVER THERE. FLORENCE, I COULD KILL YOU. I GO OUT TO THE STORE AND YOU LET THOSE PEOPLE BRING IN THAT MONSTER OF A PIANO. HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THAT? WELL, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, "NOTHING BUT A CRAZY PERSON WOULD WANT SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN HERE." BUT THEN I REMEMBERED I WAS WORKING FOR YOUR HUSBAND. SO I SAID, "BRING IT ON IN, HONEY." DOORBELL, DOORBELL. GOOD EVENING. MR. BENTLEY! YES? FLORENCE, YOU'RE ON DUTY, AREN'T YOU? YES, SIR. GOOD EVENING, MRS. JEFFERSON. HERE. LET ME. THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO WORK EITHER, DOES IT? I'LL TAKE THAT. CAN I GET YOU A DRINK? YES, THANK YOU. A SCOTCH, NEAT. DON'T WORRY. YOU'LL GET A CLEAN GLASS. OH. NO, I DIDN'T MEAN I WANTED A CLEAN GLASS. WELL, I DO, BUT WHAT I WANTED WAS NO WATER AND NO ICE. THAT'S NEAT. THAT'S WEIRD. WELL, THIS IS THE BIG NIGHT, EH? I STILL CAN'T GET OVER YOUR HUSBAND CHANGING HIS MIND... ABOUT THE TENANTS' MEETING LIKE THIS. I SAY, YOU'VE-YOU'VE REARRANGED THE FURNITURE OR SOMETHING, HAVEN'T YOU? GOOD LORD, A PIANO. I SAY, IT'S RATHER, UM, LARGE, ISN'T IT? ABOUT AS LARGE AS THE BUMP... I'M GONNA RAISE ON GEORGE'S HEAD WHEN HE GETS HOME. I KNOW... I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT NEEDS. LUDWIG. WHAT? LUDWIG. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WHAT ABOUT HIS DRINK? I NEED IT MORE THAN HE DOES. DOORBELL, MRS. JEFFERSON. I KNOW. MR. AND MRS. WILLIS, MRS. JEFFERSON. COME IN. HELLO, LOUISE. IF YOU CAN GET IN. THANK YOU. HI. HI, EVERYBODY. HELLO THERE. HOW ARE YOU? HELEN, LOOK AT THIS. WOW. I HAVEN'T SEEN A PIANO THIS BIG... SINCE BETTY GRABLE AND 30 CHORUS BOYS DANCED ON ONE. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY... "LARGE OAKS FROM LITTLE ACORNS GROW." WELL, THIS BIG PIANO CAME FROM A LITTLE NUT. I DIDN'T KNOW GEORGE WAS A PIANIST. HE ISN'T. BUT WHEN HE HEARD MR. WHITTENDALE WAS A MUSIC LOVER, HE HIRED A PIANO PLAYER TO ENTERTAIN. OF COURSE THE PIANO PLAYER IS HOME WITH THE FLU. - YOU DON'T PLAY, DO YOU? - NO, I DON'T. I'M SORRY. STILL, I MUST SAY GEORGE IS REALLY FIGHTING FOR THE TENANTS. THIS POSTSCRIPT HE PUT ON ALL THE INVITATIONS, NOW, THIS IS STRONG STUFF. YES. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE PAINT WAS PEELING IN THE CORRIDORS. I DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD COCKROACHES EITHER. IT ISN'T AND WE DON'T. OH, YOU MEAN GEORGE JUST GOT CARRIED AWAY? NOT YET, BUT I'M STILL HOPING. YOU KNOW, IN MY BUILDING, THE ROACHES ARE SO BIG... THAT WHEN YOU STEP ON 'EM THE CRUNCH DROWNS OUT THE TELEVISION. AND THEY JUST GO SPLAT! OH, YOU DON'T LIKE THEM THINGS, MR. WILLIS? I SEEM TO HAVE LOST MY APPETITE FOR THE MOMENT. HI, EVERYBODY. MOM, LOOK WHO WE FOUND DOWNSTAIRS IN THE DRUGSTORE. GRANDMA. - OH, HELLO, MOTHER JEFFERSON. - HELLO, LOUISE. I SEE POP FINALLY GOT HIS PIANO. IT'S TOO BAD THEY WERE ALL OUT OF THE BIG ONES. IF I HADN'T BUMPED INTO LIONEL IN THE DRUGSTORE, I WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN YOU WERE GIVING A PARTY. I EXPECT MY INVITATION GOT LOST IN THE MAIL, AS USUAL. IT ISN'T A PARTY, MOTHER JEFFERSON. IT'S A TENANTS' MEETING. WHY DON'T YOU COME AND HAVE A DRINK? MM. MRS. JEFFERSON, IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP? HAVE YOU GOT AN AX? MY, WHAT A LOVELY PIANO. AND WHAT FUN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE POLISHING IT EVERY DAY, LOUISE. I'LL GET IT! I'LL GET IT! I'LL GET IT! EXCUSE ME. OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. IT'S JUST ME AND LUDWIG.

I WANNA BE THE FIRST TO WELCOME HIM. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? LAST TIME I SAW SOMETHING THIS BIG IS WHEN I WAS IN THE NAVY... AND WE WAS TRYING TO SINK IT. THAT'S WHAT YOU TOLD ME TO GET, GEORGE. WHAT'S WHITTENDALE GONNA THINK WHEN HE SEES THE PLACE LOOKING LIKE THIS? MAYBE THE MUSIC WILL TAKE HIS MIND OFF THE PIANO. WHERE'S THE PIANO PLAYER? IN BED WITH THE FLU. WELL, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW, GEORGE. SO SAY HELLO TO YOUR GUESTS. GO ON. CIRCULATE. CIRCULATE? AIN'T EVEN ENOUGH ROOM TO STAND STILL. HI, GEORGE. YOU KNOW THE NELSONS. OH, YEAH. HI.
