WHAT BETTER TIME TO FOOL AROUND? IT TAKES THE PRESSURE OFF. I'M SERIOUS. SEE THERE? YOU'RE ALWAYS SERIOUS. WHY DON'T YOU RELAX, HAVE SOME FUN? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ENJOY LIFE, NOT WORRY ABOUT IT. WAIT A MINUTE. I DON'T NEED ANY LECTURES FROM YOU. I'M ONLY TRYING TO HELP. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY... ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JENNY A DULL GIRL. AND YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY... ALL PLAY AND NO WORK MAKES LIONEL A DUMMY. HEY, LOOK, YOU AIN'T GOT TO GO OFF. HEY, JENNY. HONEST, LIONEL, CUTTING CLASS LIKE THIS IS NOT GONNA HELP YOUR GRADES. HEY, GIRL, WILL YOU STOP BEING SUCH A DRAG? YOU AIN'T MY MOTHER. WELL, I'M YOUR MOTHER... AND I DON'T WANT YOU SKIPPING SCHOOL TODAY. LOOK, I HAD A LONG NIGHT, ALL RIGHT, MOM? YEAH, BUT YOU'VE GOT A DIPLOMA TO GET. IT'S JUST A PIECE OF PAPER. IT'S A PIECE OF PAPER THAT NO JEFFERSON EVER GOT BEFORE, AND YOU ARE GONNA GET ONE. WHO WAS THAT AT THE DOOR? JENNY.

YOU GOT MY LIFE ALL PLANNED OUT, DON'T YOU? WHAT? WHAT'S THE BIG RUSH? MAYBE I DON'T WANNA BE AN ENGINEER. THERE AIN'T NO BIG HURRY TO DECIDE WHAT I DO WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE. WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU, LIONEL? NOTHING. WHY? YOU'RE FLYING A LITTLE TOO HIGH, MR. JET SET. TIME TO COME DOWN TO EARTH. AND I DON'T WANT YOU SKIPPING SCHOOL ANYMORE EITHER. THAT JUST COULD BE THE PROBLEM. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT DROPPING OUT FOR A WHILE. MAYBE INDEFINITELY. WHAT? AND THROW AWAY YOUR WHOLE FUTURE? NO, I'M NOT. THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS TO DO IN THIS WORLD. WHO KNOWS WHAT I COULD BE? WATCH OUT. YOU MIGHT GO FROM A "COULD BE" TO A "HAS-BEEN"... WITHOUT EVER BEING AN "IS." HOW FAR DO YOU THINK YOU'LL GET WITHOUT A COLLEGE DEGREE? WHO KNOWS? THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE NOW. I'D JUST LIKE TO TAKE A SHOT AT IT. AT WHAT?

NOT EVEN JENNY KNOWS WHERE HE IS. OH, GEORGE, I'M VERY WORRIED. WELL, DON'T BE. WHEREVER HE IS, HE'S A LOT SAFER... THAN IF HE WAS TO WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR RIGHT NOW.

I WAS DOWN BEFORE GUY LOMBARDO EVEN REACHED THE BANDSTAND. I WAS DOWN BEFORE THE BALL WAS UP. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING, SO IF YOU DON'T MIND... NOT AT ALL. YOU GO RIGHT ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS. I'LL GO AND OPEN UP THE BUBBLY. AS MOTHER ALWAYS SAID, "NO SENSE WASTING A GOOD CHILL." LOUISE, WILL YOU... ACTUALLY, MOTHER COULDN'T HAVE SAID THAT... - BECAUSE SHE NEVER DRANK. - BENTLEY! HOWEVER, SHE DID TAKE A PINCH OF MY FATHER'S SNUFF NOW AND THEN. EVERY TIME SHE SNEEZED, SHE DUSTED AN ENTIRE ROOM. LOUISE, WILL YOU GET RID OF HIM. HE'S OUR GUEST. - HE'S YOUR GUEST. - LOSE HIM. OH, JOLLY GOOD. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SOMEWHERE ON THIS EARTH, THERE'S A WHOLE COUNTRY FULL OF THEM. HERE WE ARE THEN. NOTHING LIKE A DROP OF THE OLD CHAMPAGGERS, EH? 1969 WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR.

THOUGH I MUST SAY WE HAD THE STRANGEST CONVERSATION THIS MORNING. - WHAT WAS STRANGE ABOUT IT? - I WAS THE ONLY ONE TALKING. I SAID "GOOD MORNING" AND HE DIDN'T ANSWER. SO I TRIED "GOOD-BYE," BUT BY THEN HE WAS GONE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR THE MOST MARVELOUS JOKE... THE RUSSIAN AMBASSADOR TOLD ME TODAY? WHERE COULD LIONEL BE? IT SEEMS THIS RUSSIAN FATHER CAME HOME ONE NIGHT... AND HE COULDN'T FIND HIS LITTLE SON ANYWHERE. SO HE ASKED HIS DISTRAUGHT WIFE WHERE THE LITTLE FELLOW WAS... AND SHE REPLIED, WITH TEARS IN HER EYES... THAT THE SECRET POLICE HAD COME AND TAKEN THE BOY AWAY... TO THE SALT MINES OF SIBERIA. TO WHICH THE FATHER REPLIED, "THANK GOODNESS. FOR A MOMENT I THOUGHT HE'D RUN AWAY." STRANGE.
