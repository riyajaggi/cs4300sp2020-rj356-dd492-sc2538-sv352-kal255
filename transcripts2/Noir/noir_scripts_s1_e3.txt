 Coppelia?s casket
 The flowing tears have
already dried up
 Solitude starved for blood
 Death dances, smelling of angel down
 In a town where the black
sun never sets
 Everyone works silently
with an air of deception
 I cannot meet you
 I cannot meet you here
 God, our savior
 Coppelia?s casket
 People are dolls tired of dancing
 The lamb on the altar
 Where is the mechanical
dream headed?
 Coppelia?s casket
 O light awakened from the darkness
 The lamb on the altar
 Where is the dream with the
broken spring headed?
 Noir?
 It is the name of an ancient fate.
 Two maidens who govern death.
 The peace of the newly born,
 their black hands protect.
 [The Assassination Play]
 We have a job.
 Who?s the target?
 Albert Dux.
 Seems to be quite the villain.
 A big shot in the business
world, Albert Dux.
 Vanier?s young president
died in an accident,
 but no one related to him thinks
that it was an accident.
 Who is that?
 The young president?s widow.
She?s our client.
 Do you know her?
 I think so.
 I?d like some of these.
 Thank you very much. The
belladonna lilies, correct?
 Yes.
 You?ve bought those flowers before.
 You sure remember some trivial things.
 We?ve met before, haven?t we?
 Yes.
 A friend of mine is buried here.
 Do you come often?
 I hardly ever come.
 I see.
 We weren?t that close, but in a way,
I sort of cared for him.
 Did he like belladonna lilies?
 Something like that.
 Then you?re the same as me.
 Then?
 Yes, the one dear to me also
liked belladonna lilies.
 I hated them at first,
 because belladonnas are
poisonous, you know?
 However, apparently belladonna lilies
are a completely different species.
 But even if they were poisonous,
they?re the flowers he loved most.
 We?re going to do it, then?
 Yes, we are.
 Dux recently bought a resort hotel.
 He?s staying in a suite at the hotel
 to make remodeling arrangements
before they open.
 It?s a golden opportunity for us.
 There are three routes to the suite
on the top floor.
 You go around from the stairs that go
to the emergency exit.
 All right.
 Well, I never thought that THE Noir
was a young lady like you.
 Drop your weapon.
 So it was you.
 Seal off the hotel at once!
They have nowhere to run!
 To think that Noir was two people.
 I can?t believe it was a trap.
 Dux and the client were in it together.
 It was all made up from the start.
 The name of the target
has been changed!
 They were after us to begin with,
after Noir.
 But what in the world for?
Why would they be after us?
 They?re pros, just like us.
 They were probably hired by someone.
 You?re saying that there?s someone
else who set up this little game?
 Yes.
 The hunter and the hunted have
switched places, that?s all.
 It doesn?t change the fact that
we?re dealing in human lives.
 Fine then. But who set this up?
 The enemy.
 The bastards who stole your memory?
 That enemy has made a move.
 Squad C. Respond, Squad C.
 They got Squad C too. They?re
certainly living up to their name.
 We?re going with Plan 3.
 Squad B here. The targets have
entered the casino hall.
 Roger that. Get everyone together
and wait for instructions.
 It looks like we?ve been
chased into this place.
 Want something to drink? Or would
you rather have some popcorn?
 I?ve reached the breaker.
 All right, cut it.
 They mean to duke it out here.
 Give me some.
 Give me some popcorn.
 Let?s go!
 The first time we met was
a coincidence, right?
 People like us shouldn?t
visit cemeteries.
 We just fall into the graves
at our feet ourselves.
 They?re calling to us from
the other side.
 I wonder if the dead were blinding me?
 Maybe so.
 What about that grave?
 My husband?s.
 But he wasn?t the young president.
 Though it?s true that he liked
those flowers.
 Tell me. Who hired you to kill Noir?
 Would you tell?
 No.
 What is your name?
 What?s the point of asking?
 Neither you nor I have a grave waiting
onto which to carve our names.
 I don?t understand.
 The enemy hired Dux and
his men to get rid of Noir.
 But Dux had not been told that
Noir?s identity was you and I.
 Maybe it really was a game.
 Dux, you, and I are nothing more
than game pieces.
 I guess so.
 The enemy is always watching us.
 Even now, they?re watching us
from somewhere.
 We have no choice but to keep on
winning these games.
 Yes?
 And someday?
 Not having a grave isn?t something
that saddens me.
 Because it is the path
I chose for myself.
 To be certain, this is not your grave.
 But so what?
 So what if that?s true?
 The soft touch
 Finally made me realize
how cold my cheek was
 Like waking up in the morning
 And noticing the birds chirping
for the first time
 Suddenly
 I don?t know anything yet
 What my heart is seeking
 I don?t know
 I was always looking up at the sky
 Like this, since who knows when
 I would send my thoughts
to right below that cloud
