 Noir (2001–…): Season 1, Episode 2 - Daily Bread - full transcript 
 A policeman of an anti-terror unit dies in an explosion. As he is the third of his unit to be killed, his superiors fear that they may have a leak. A rival faction of the terrorists responsible for the killings hires Noir to terminate the leak and his contact. After careful planning, Mireille and Kirika break into the terrorists' hideout, while both their targets are there. Hearing that an assassin named Noir has been hired to kill them, the policeman wonders whether there is a relation to an assassin named Noir who was last active in the 1970s. Mireille and Kirika complete their assignment.

 Noir?
 It is the name of an ancient fate.
 Two maidens who govern death.
 The peace of the newly born,
 their black hands protect.
 Five, six, seven?
 Oh, it?s Papa!
 I?m home, Henri.
 Papa, welcome back!
 Hello, Dear. You?re early today.
 Yeah, I finished my work
earlier than I expected.
 Louis sure is sleeping well.
 He was being awful until
just a minute ago.
 He wouldn?t stop crying.
 Really?
 Oh yeah, Henri,
 tomorrow, let?s go together to buy
that game you wanted.
 Really?! All right!
 ? Isn?t that great?
? Really?! All right!
 Isn?t that great?
 [Daily Bread]
 It?s a job.
 What should we do?
 Well, let?s look into it.
 Bored?
 Come on, let?s head home.
 O benevolent God,
 through the death and resurrection
of Your own son, Christ,
 You bestowed upon the faithful
 the hope of eternal life
and resurrection.
 Allow those laid to rest today
to rest in peace
 until the day of resurrection.
 May they receive the
joy of eternal life
 through Christ, who is our life
and resurrection.
 I need to talk to you.
 ? In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
? I need to talk to you.
 ? In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
? Then we can go back to the
Public Peace Department?
 ? In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
? No, let?s talk in my car.
 No, let?s talk in my car.
 ? Amen.
? No, let?s talk in my car.
 Amen.
 The man that was killed
was an officer
 of the National MP Anti-Terrorist Unit.
 I hate that we can only say to the
public that he was a policeman,
 when he was a hero who gave
his life for his country.
 I feel the same.
 This is the third man.
 The first two were petty
officers of GIGN.
 And now a commissioned officer.
 How the hell did they find out the
identity of the GIGN members?
 Vice-Chief, you don?t think?
 We cannot deny the possibility
 that the information was leaked
from our department.
 For our part, at the very least, I would
like to have a report readied
 for the Ministry of National Defense.
 Is that clear?
 I understand. I will begin the
investigation immediately.
 With absolute secrecy.
 Yes, Sir.
 I hope that our fears turn out
to be unfounded.
 I shall also pray that it is so.
 There we go.
 All?s well with the world, I guess.
 Would you get that knife for me?
 Sure.
 Here.
 Thank you.
 That?s our daily bread. In other
words, Heaven?s blessing.
 Why don?t you eat it as though
you?re enjoying it more?
 I am enjoying it.
 You don?t look it at all.
 Really?
 Yes, really.
 You don?t remember anything
about yourself.
 What about me?
 Mireille Bouquet, a most trustworthy
assassin for hire.
 I see.
 Then shall we move on to
the more important topic?
 I know you found more
than just this gun.
 You have one more thing
that you?re hiding.
 Take it out.
 Thanks to you, we were able
to execute those dogs.
 Those three dogs of GIGN.
 There?s no fool like a ferocious dog
that?s loyal to his master.
 You?re contributing towards the
future of France, a true patriot.
 And the money?
 The usual. More importantly, what
about the Public Peace Department?
 Don?t worry. I am with you.
 I?m counting on you, comrade.
 I?ll see you here again next week.
 Our target is Director of France?s
National Public Peace Department,
 Jean Jacques Legrand.
 And?
 Key officer in the leading faction
of the People?s Armed Alliance,
 a far right terrorist organization,
Pierre Cressoy.
 So Legrand sold GIGN?s
roster to this guy.
 And in return,
 he got information from Cressoy and
improved his conviction rate.
 Our client is another faction of
the People?s Armed Alliance.
 They were burned by information
that the leading faction leaked,
 so they?re out to get rid of
 the leading faction?s key officer
and Legrand in one shot.
 Well, both of them are
pretty worthless,
 but the fee isn?t too bad.
 Here he comes.
 It?s just like the client said.
 There?s definitely a link between
Legrand and Cressoy.
 This is the leading
faction?s hideout.
 I don?t know how they got such
a property in this day and age.
 These are the blueprints
for that building.
 The emergency exits
are here and here.
 The front was blocked, so our paths
of entry will be limited.
 There are two routes.
 I?ll cover the main one.
 You take the remaining escape route.
 Welcome to our fort, comrade.
 It had better be really important
for you to have sent for me.
 Yeah, it probably is.
 What?s this about?
 The activities of one of our other
factions have been bothering me
 for the past few days.
 So I captured one of them,
just for kicks.
 What?
 This way.
 He was tough, but he spilled
his guts an hour ago.
 It seems the branch faction hired
a hitman to kill you and me.
 You?re certain?
 Yeah, sounds like something
they?d come up with.
 And did you get the assassin?s
name out of him?
 The codename is Noir. He doesn?t
seem to know anything beyond that.
 Noir?!
 That Noir?! No, it can?t be.
 You recognize it?
 Yes, I do. That name holds a special
meaning in the underworld.
 In the past, we,
 the French National Public
Peace Department,
 have also hired Noir for jobs.
 But that was back in the seventies.
 Does this mean that Noir has
become active again?
 Or is someone completely unrelated
calling himself Noir?
 No matter who Noir is, we know
that he?s coming.
 We have plenty of options
available to us.
 Don?t worry, we?ll gather our
members right away.
 What about him?
 Do whatever you want.
 You go around to the emergency
exit with the Director.
 Got it.
 The rest of you, follow me.
 Damn it!
 It can?t be!
 How can? You? you?re Noir?!
 Your work is always so
vulgar, you know?
 Looks like today will be
a beautiful day.
 Daily bread? I make a living
by killing people.
 But then why don?t I feel sad?
 If we could find that out,
 I?d be able to kill you
and be done with it.
