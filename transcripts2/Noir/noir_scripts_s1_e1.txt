 Coppelia?s casket
 The flowing tears have
already dried up
 Solitude starved for blood
 Death dances, smelling of angel down
 In a town where the black
sun never sets
 Everyone works silently
with an air of deception
 I cannot meet you
 I cannot meet you here
 God, our savior
 Coppelia?s casket
 People are dolls tired of dancing
 The lamb on the altar
 Where is the mechanical
dream headed?
 Coppelia?s casket
 O light awakened from the darkness
 The lamb on the altar
 Where is the dream with the
broken spring headed?
 Noir?
 It is the name of an ancient fate.
 Two maidens who govern death.
 The peace of the newly born,
 their black hands protect.
 ?Make a pilgrimage for
the past with me.?
 A pilgrimage to the past?
 Whatever. This is stupid.
 [Maidens with Black Hands]
 Tell me.
 Who in the world are you?
 That?s as far as you go.
 Some pilgrimage.
 I?m only going to ask one more time.
 Who are you?
 Noir.
 I?ve been waiting for you.
 That little?
 Are they after me?
 No.
 Don?t tell me that she did them all.
 I can kill people.
 So easily.
 But then why?
 ?don?t I feel sad?
 That should do it.
 Thank you. You seem very familiar
with treating wounds.
 Were you once a nurse or something?
 I don?t know.
 So this is your home?
 But it isn?t your home.
 Kirika Yumura?
 [Identification Card]
[Kirika Yumura]
 [Identification Card]
[Kirika Yumura]
That?s my name.
 And that isn?t your real name either.
 I?ve done some checking up on you.
 The Yumura family of three bought
this house half a year ago
 and moved in.
 Soon after, your parents went to
America to their new job posts.
 And you live here alone,
attending school.
 But it was all a lie.
 The documents that were
submitted to public offices
 and the school were all forgeries.
 Your family register, your
parents? workplaces?
 None of it actually exists.
 The Yumura husband and wife
disappeared immediately
 under the pretext of
moving overseas.
 Someone was pretending
to be your parents.
 Who are you? Where did you come
from and what were you doing here?
 Is something wrong?
 I don?t know why I can
do things like this.
 And that?s not all.
 I?
 ?don?t know anything.
 When I came to, I was here.
 Who am I?
 I am Noir.
 Beyond that, I know nothing.
 And I found this.
 That isn?t all.
 I know even more terrible things.
 I do. Why?
 You don?t remember anything
about yourself.
 What about me?
 Mireille Bouquet, a most trustworthy
assassin for hire.
 I see.
 Then shall we move on to
the more important topic?
 I know you found more
than just this gun.
 You have one more thing
that you?re hiding.
 Take it out.
 Stop it.
 You know, don?t you?
 You know?
 And then?
 You contacted me.
 Some pilgrimage.
 Noir?
 A pilgrimage to your past and mine.
 One?
 My job is to kill people.
 Not to help them.
 Two?
 I have always worked alone.
 And I intend to keep it?
 Please lend me your help, Mireille.
 What in the world am I?
Just until?
 Until I find that answer.
 I?ve made the arrangements
to leave the country.
 Thank you.
 Haven?t you had enough?
 I can?t understand
 why you?d bid your fond farewells
in a place like this.
 ?Even when I was in a crowd,
I was always alone.?
 That isn?t mine. It was
Ernest Hemingway.
 Let?s go, Mireille.
 You know what I do for a living.
 I cannot let you live.
 You know that, don?t you?
 Yes?
 All right, I?ll team up with you.
 They are sure to come after us again.
 There?s something I want to ask them.
 When that?s over,
 I will kill you.
 I?ll be waiting for that moment.
 The soft touch
 Finally made me realize
how cold my cheek was
 Like waking up in the morning
 And noticing the birds chirping
for the first time
 Suddenly
 I don?t know anything yet
 What my heart is seeking
 I don?t know
 I was always looking up at the sky
 Like this, since who knows when
 I would send my thoughts
to right below that cloud
