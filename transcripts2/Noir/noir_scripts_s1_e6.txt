 Coppelia?s casket
 The flowing tears have
already dried up
 Solitude starved for blood
 Death dances, smelling of angel down
 In a town where the
black sun never sets
 Everyone works silently
with an air of deception
 I cannot meet you
 I cannot meet you here
 God, our savior
 Coppelia?s casket
 People are dolls tired of dancing
 The lamb on the altar
 Where is the mechanical
dream headed?
 Coppelia?s casket
 O light awakened from the darkness
 The lamb on the altar
 Where is the dream with the
broken spring headed?
 Noir?
 It is the name of an ancient fate.
 Two maidens who govern death.
 The peace of the newly born,
 their black hands protect.
 [Lost Kitten]
 There we go.
 Let?s go.
 What are you doing?
 I?ve finished checking us in.
 Hey, get in line!
 Please?
 Thank you so much. You?re
always so good to us.
 ? There?s no one here who
knows his name.
? Thank you so much. You?re
always so good to us.
 ? There?s no one here who
knows his name.
? Thank you.
 Thank you.
 He doesn?t seek any
compensation whatsoever.
 He has just devoted himself
to the people here.
 For years, for decades?
 Many people idolize him,
calling him a saint.
 Ex-KGB, Yuri Nazarov.
That?s who he really is.
 There was an ethnic minority
called the Tashkil
 who were slaughtered in an old
Soviet Union concentration camp.
 And the one who ordered the
execution was Nazarov.
 In time,
 he quit the KGB and disappeared,
leaving everything behind.
 No one knows why.
 And now, he?s a saint to the destitute.
 Our clients are the surviving
people of Tashkil.
 Though the man is probably
doing this as atonement,
 I guess the hatred of those
who were murdered
 can?t be erased so easily.
 It?s a simple job.
 Mireille?
 What is it?
 I?m going out for a little walk.
 I?m back.
 You were out for quite a while.
 What?s that?
 Did you buy dinner or something?
 Hey, what the heck are you thinking?
 Really, what the heck
are you thinking?
 That cat?
 You?re not thinking of taking it all
the way back to Paris, are you?
 This cat?s name?
 If?
 If he has a name, then
he?s not like me.
 Then he?s just lost.
 I don?t have a name.
 All I have is a lie called Kirika Yumura.
 It?s all the same to me.
 It doesn?t change the fact that you?re
part of a much bigger lie.
 But?
 I?m pretty much like you too.
 We?re both being dragged
around in the dark.
 To get the real answers, we?ll have
to ask them? the Soldats.
 The man within the man.
 The love within the love.
 The sin within the sin.
 The hermit told unto the sinner,
the Soldats is with truth.
 The Soldats?
 I don?t know what that means at all.
 But I will find out.
 What is your name anyway?
 Prince Myshkin?
 Prince Myshkin?
 Yes, Prince Myshkin.
 That?s his name.
 So, he?s your cat.
 He went missing a couple days ago.
 Have you been taking
care of him, Miss?
 Oh no, it wasn?t anything like that.
 Please accept my gratitude anyway.
Thank you.
 Well, then.
 Goodbye, Prince Myshkin.
 It seems the Prince is saying
that he will miss you.
 Then?
 What?s wrong?
 Mister?
 Please, please hang in there.
 Mister, please hang in there. Mister!
 He has been pushing himself
for far too long.
 I warned him many times.
 But he won?t give any thought
to his health,
 always just working for others.
 There?s nothing more
I can do for him.
 He doesn?t have very long to live.
 Not long.
 Balkutsk, 1951.
 We heard from Dr. Svenson
that you saved his life.
 Thank you.
 Thank you so much. Truly,
thank you, thank you.
 Thank you for saving him.
 In the end, this is my only chance.
 If I don?t do it now,
 I won?t ever?
 Are you feeling all right?
 Are you all right?
 Get well soon, okay?
 Play with us again, okay?
 Play with us, okay?
 Yeah, and cook for us again too.
 Oh, I wish I could have some now.
 It?s so delicious!
 So get well soon, okay?
 Oh, guess what?
 What is it? What?s wrong?
 It?s got to be a family picture, right?
 And from the looks of it, I suppose
this boy would be Nazarov?
 If it?s 1951, that?s about right.
 I?ll search for Balkutsk as
a geographic location.
 But now I know a little bit
more about you.
 You excel at assassination techniques,
 you?re well-versed in the ways
of the underworld,
 and you speak various languages,
 but you have no knowledge
of Russian literature.
 Russian literature?
 Prince Myshkin is the protagonist
of Dostoevsky?s ?The Idiot?.
 He?s the embodiment of a pure
and innocent soul.
 A pure and innocent soul?
 That?s strange. There?s no place
called Balkutsk anywhere.
 I see.
 Let me just say that no matter
 what kind of person Nazarov
had turned out to be,
 it wouldn?t have mattered to us.
 Nazarov is an idiot.
 No matter how kind he is
to the destitute,
 it doesn?t resolve anything.
 It only serves to satisfy himself.
And even the destitute?
 I know that.
 I think Nazarov knows it too.
 But there?s nothing he can do.
 He?s just waiting for
the snow to fall.
 Snow?
 Yes?
 For the snow to pile up.
 Balkutsk used to be the home
of the Norga.
 In Stalin?s era, the Tashkil
assaulted the village,
 and now, not even its name remains.
 So Nazarov is a Norga.
 They?re both ethnic minorities,
 but the Norga and the Tashkil
have long hated each other.
 Even though the times changed,
they kept on killing each other.
 At this point, we can?t tell
 which is the cause and which
is the effect anymore.
 Many, many months and
years have passed
 since the massacre at the
concentration camp.
 I can?t even imagine what?s been
going through his mind.
 What do you want to do
about this job?
 Being left with a bad aftertaste
would be rather?
 And if he?s dying from an illness,
we needn?t go to the trouble?
 I?ll do it.
 This job?
 I?ll do it.
 The soft touch
 Finally made me realize
how cold my cheek was
 Like waking up in the morning
 And noticing the birds chirping
for the first time
 Suddenly
 I don?t know anything yet
 What my heart is seeking
 I don?t know
 I was always looking up at the sky
 Like this, since who knows when
 I would send my thoughts
to right below that cloud
