 Noir?
 It is the name of an ancient fate.
 Two maidens who govern death.
 The peace of the newly born,
 their black hands protect.
 Go ahead, Mireille. Do it.
 Thank you for putting up
with me until today.
 [The Black Thread of Fate]
 Balsan is dead.
 The great revolutionary, Balsan,
 was killed by the assassin
that you bastards hired!
 Oh, how can this be?! The great
Balsan! Our Balsan!
 Talk! Who did you bastards hire?!
 Noir?
 A name that ranks at the very top
 of all who make a living off murder.
 We know nothing of him
except the name.
 Noir?!
 But Noir is indeed the servant of God.
 You defiled this land with blood
in the name of revolution!
 And Balsan paid the price for it!
 We have to walk once we get
beyond the Aramera River.
 How are you going to manage that
in your condition?
 If we don?t cross the river
by four o?clock,
 the chopper we arranged for
will have departed.
 Bringing down your target isn?t
enough to make you a pro.
 You?re not a pro until you?ve
made a clean getaway.
 You know that as well as I.
 Does it hurt?
 No, I?m fine.
 If only you?d just died, I would
have been free of you.
 You?re right.
 I?ve heard of the name Noir.
 From back when you were working
in the Pakistani underground?
 Yeah, I hear he?s more terrifying
than the Grim Reaper.
 The Grim Reaper?
 The Grim Reaper, is he? Fine then.
 I?ll find Noir, even if it
costs me my life,
 and put him through
the tortures of Hell!
 We?ll drag the Grim Reaper
out into the desert sun!
 Mireille, that student ID?
 I think I lost the student ID
when I got shot.
 I was carrying it with me. I just
couldn?t throw it away.
 It wasn?t? It wasn?t even real.
 It wasn?t even the real me
or anything, but?
 Be quiet.
 Now isn?t the time for that.
 When I came to, I was here.
 My name, my records, all lies.
 Who am I?
 I am Noir.
 Beyond that, I know nothing.
 But?
 Even if it was a lie,
it was in my hands.
 It was mine.
 I might still be able to make it.
 If I go alone?
 Did anyone see anything?!
 Stop!
 Hurry up and open the door!
 Show us your ID! Hurry up!
 What the hell is this?!
 Hurry up and open the trunk!
 Stop! Hey! You too!
 Hurry up!
 Go ahead, Mireille. Do it.
 Thank you for putting up
with me until today.
 Now hurry.
 You?ve got to be kidding me.
 Did you think to take the
easy way out alone?
 I couldn?t care less about
who you really are.
 I have questions for the
bastards in the Soldats.
 I?ll never let you die until
I find out who they are.
 When I find that out,
 I will kill you.
 Yeah, I?d forgotten.
 Did you find anything?!
 Hey, look at this.
 What the hell?!
 Here.
 Hey, there?s the guy!
 It?s a woman?!
 She?s hurt!
 She?s still a kid!
 What?s this?
 Yes, I understand, Sir!
 A pilgrimage to your past and mine.
 But they?re not spending
their money right.
 What? You mean HQ?s comm gear?
 Well, my girlfriend has
this cell phone?
 Cell phone?
 Yeah, it?s real high fidelity.
Better than HQ?s.
 I bet the rate?s higher too.
 Hey?
 It is the name of an ancient fate.
 Two maidens who govern death.
 To the depths of Hell?s fire,
 their black souls
lure the lost children.
 This is the Grim Reaper?
 There?s no doubt she has
something to do with Noir.
 This little girl?!
 This girl has the scent
of death about her.
 She?s?
 What?s that?
 It was on the floor of
the east corridor.
 It?s your picture.
 Kirika Yumura?
 I?m told that?s what the card says.
 Is that your real name?
Or is it an alias?
 Why do you use an alias?!
Are you a friend of Noir?!
 Confess to all your sins.
 You?ll be burning in the
fires of Hell anyway.
 Is that card so precious
to you?! Well?!
 You bastards killed Balsan! You filthy
assassins murdered Balsan!
 You shameless demon!
 You bastard! You bastards!
 Nothing unusual over here.
 Hi!
 Is she dead?
 No, I?ll only kill her after
she?s suffered pain
 as if her entire body had turned
into burning sand.
 What about her friend?
 The friend was spotted
in town at 17:30.
 There?s already a squad headed there.
 I?ll check.
 What?s wrong?
 No one?s answering.
What?s wrong?
 No one?s answering.
 What?
 Is it the government military?
 No way! We?d have been informed
of any changes in their activity.
 You guys go too!
 Noir? nom?
 Nom? jadis?
 Let me tell you something.
 Noir is a name for two.
 Noir?
 That?s right, an assassination unit
made up of two people.
 Noir? It is? the name?
of? two? death?
 What?s she saying?!
 Noir? It is the name
of an ancient fate.
 Two maidens who govern death.
 What is she talking about?
 Is it a prayer?
 The peace of the newly born,
 their black hands protect.
 In the end, a lie is a lie.
 I knew that.
 I thought I had understood that
from the beginning.
 Mireille?
 Who am I?
 The thread that binds
you and I together?
 The color of that thread
is sure to be black.
 A pitch-black thread, blacker
than the darkness.
