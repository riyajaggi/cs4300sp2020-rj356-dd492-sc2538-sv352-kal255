 Coppelia?s casket
 The flowing tears have
already dried up
 Solitude starved for blood
 Death dances, smelling of angel down
 In a town where the black
sun never sets
 Everyone works silently
with an air of deception
 I cannot meet you
 I cannot meet you here
 God, our savior
 Coppelia?s casket
 People are dolls tired of dancing
 The lamb on the altar
 Where is the mechanical
dream headed?
 Coppelia?s casket
 O light awakened from the darkness
 The lamb on the altar
 Where is the dream with the
broken spring headed?
 Noir?
 It is the name of an ancient fate.
 Two maidens who govern death.
 The peace of the newly born,
 their black hands protect.
 Is that you, Mireille?
 It?s Vanel.
 I have some information.
 Right, it?s about that.
 No, I?ll tell you the details when
we meet in person.
 Why don?t you come to my house
tomorrow at noon?
 My wife wants you to visit too.
 We were too late.
 [Les Soldats]
 It?s my fault.
 I was checking out whom Dux had
come into contact with recently.
 I?d asked Vanel for information too.
 And Vanel was killed for it.
 Along with his entire family.
 It?s no use.
 It?s no use thinking about it.
 You?re right.
 They tried to kill us.
Tried to kill Noir.
 The first time we met was
a coincidence, right?
 Tell me. Who hired you to kill Noir?
 Would you tell?
 No.
 What is your name?
 What?s the point of asking?
 Neither you nor I have a grave waiting
onto which to carve our names.
 Vanel found a clue as to who they are.
 Morning.
 It?s all fine and good to
take care of the flowers,
 but they might soon turn pitch black.
 Noir? I knew of that name too.
 One of the oldest designations
in our line of work.
 But no one knows of its origins.
 This puzzle is made up of nothing
but mysterious pieces.
 The piece called Noir.
Another piece, which is you.
 And one more?
 I?m going to check out
Vanel?s old haunts.
 You don?t need to come.
 It?s so brutal,
killing his entire family.
 Vanel was a man with a
strong sense of honor.
 He still paid his respects to me,
his old superior,
 even after he became influential.
 He was quite dignified, but he was
such a doting father.
 He loved his son and daughter dearly.
 And his wife was a fine woman too.
 I know.
 That family was among the rare
people that I could trust.
 Yes, they were. Oh, by the way?
 About last week?
 Right, last week, he did come here,
just like you said.
 He suddenly showed up for
the first time in two years,
 so I remember it well.
 Did he say anything?
 No, nothing in particular?
 Come to think of it, I think
he looked a little pale.
 I see.
 That?s right! He left a bottle
in your name.
 What? Where is it?
 Ah, yes, here it is.
 He said he wanted to share it
with you next time.
 Mireille, to our memories
of St. Galen?s Cathedral.
 What memories of St.
Galen?s Cathedral?
 I?ve never even been there.
 This?
 I don?t know what that?s about either.
 Circles around the D and 5.
Triangles around the G and 7.
 Vanel must have found out
something really big.
 He got scared, so he hid it.
 Probably somewhere in
St. Galen?s Cathedral.
 Somewhere in St. Galen?s Cathedral?
 The chapel?
 And the belfry?
 The cloister?
 The monastery?
 No?
 The herb garden?
 The catacombs?
 ?D?? droit? Right, five.
 One,
 two,
 three,
 four,
 five.
 Fifth to the right.
 ?G? is for gauche, seventh to the left.
 One,
 two,
 three,
 four,
 five,
 six,
 seven.
 So you did come.
 What?
 I knew I was being watched,
 and that you were after that.
 But what we?re after is you.
 You?re going to tell us everything
 about who you?re taking orders from.
 You think it?ll be that easy?
 What?s the big deal about the
photocopy in that folder?
 It?s very precious, more precious
than anyone?s life on this Earth.
 You?re the one who killed Vanel
and his family, aren?t you?
 Such were their orders. The secret
must be maintained.
 They? Who are they?
 Do you want to know?
 I bet you do.
 They are an absolute presence,
 but very few know much about them.
 The very few, like me.
 Shoot me and your key will disappear.
 The man within the man.
 The love within the love.
 The sin within the sin.
 The hermit told unto the sinner,
the Soldats is with truth.
 The Soldats?
 That is their name. Our enemy.
 Back in my homeland?
 In Corsica, my parents and
older brother were killed.
 I don?t know who killed them or why.
 That was the last time
I ever saw this watch.
 You brought this from my past.
 But now, I have nothing.
 I?m sorry.
 I?m sorry, Mireille.
 I will open the door to the past.
 With my own hands,
and without fail.
 The soft touch
 Finally made me realize
how cold my cheek was
 Like waking up in the morning
 And noticing the birds chirping
for the first time
 Suddenly
 I don?t know anything yet
 What my heart is seeking
 I don?t know
 I was always looking up at the sky
 Like this, since who knows when
 I would send my thoughts
to right below that cloud

[The truth that vanished]
[into the snowy field]
 [taking the abominable past with it]
 [continues to wander in the snow]
