 Noir (2001–…): Season 1, Episode 10 - The True Noir - full transcript 
 When Mireille and Kirika take a contract to assassinate a crooked cop who was released on a technicality, they're shocked to discover that someone has taken down the guards...and the crooked cop as well. Mireille and Kirika are totally puzzled and there's a rumor circulating around the streets that Noir was the one who did the job. Is the rumor referring to Mireille and Kirika? Or is there someone else out on the streets who is using the codename as well...someone who could be far more dangerous than even Mireille and Kirika themselves?

 Coppelia?s casket
 The flowing tears have
already dried up
 Solitude starved for blood
 Death dances, smelling of angel down
 In a town where the
black sun never sets
 Everyone works silently
with an air of deception
 I cannot meet you
 I cannot meet you here
 God, our savior
 Coppelia?s casket
 People are dolls tired of dancing
 The lamb on the altar
 Where is the mechanical
dream headed?
 Coppelia?s casket
 O light awakened from the darkness
 The lamb on the altar
 Where is the dream with the
broken spring headed?
 Noir?
 It is the name of an ancient fate.
 Two maidens who govern death.
 The peace of the newly born,
 their black hands protect.
 As the above facts indicate,
 the defendant Maurice Rubik
is clearly guilty.
 The defendant is a police
officer, and yet?
 There are suspicions regarding
the legitimacy of the evidence.
 Therefore, this preliminary
court of inquiry
 declares that this indictment of
corruption cannot proceed
 and the charges shall be dropped.
 The defendant shall be transferred
to the court of misdemeanors
 on the charge of inflicting
bodily harm.
 Please wait a minute!
 The defendant is a participant in
a large-scale corruption case.
 This concerns both the judiciary
and the police organization?
 This court is dismissed.
 [The True Noir]
 A deposit has been made. It?s half
the sum, as promised.
 It looks like our client believes
that we did the job.
 Many people hated the corrupt
police officer Rubik.
 And one of them got there first.
 No?
 This hit wasn?t anything like that.
 Then what are you saying it was?
 Anyway, we still have the other half
of the job to do.
 The crucial man behind it all?
 With a preliminary judge
on their side,
 the police can concentrate on acts
of corruption without any worries.
 It?s our job. We?ll kill D?Estaing.
 We?ll think about what to do with
the half payment for Rubik later.
 It?s getting chilly.
 Shall I make some tea?
 Mireille?
 I know.
 Who was it that got there before us?
 Someone who could accomplish
a hit as big as that?
 There aren?t many in the industry.
 Don?t worry, we?ll find out soon.
 Soon?
 I am always praying.
 Chloe, always, for you.
 That you will accomplish your
tasks without mishap
 and that you will return to me
whole and well.
 Noir?!
 That?s right. The rumor on the streets
 is that Noir did the hit
on the courthouse.
 That?s Noir for you.
That sure was something.
 I had heard that they?d recently
started doing jobs again.
 I guess it was true.
 I?m just happy Rubik got offed.
 I might be a criminal too,
but crooked cops
 are the worst kind of jerks out there.
 He?s probably rotting in Hell
right about now.
 There?s a rumor going around.
 Multiple sources in the black market
say that Noir did it.
 Are they referring to us?
 Or?
 To the unidentified assassin
that did Rubik?
 I don?t know.
 But we?re the ones they?re after.
 I don?t like this breeze.
 He who sees his own reflection dies.
 There?s a story like that, isn?t there?
 Wasn?t it Poe?
 Noir and?
 The Soldats?
 A mysterious group
 that was even involved in the birth of
the Mafia two hundred years ago.
 How are these two related?
 Your task is very special this time.
 You will meet her and her friend.
 Oh, how I have waited for this day!
 Everything depends on you.
Go see with your own eyes.
 See for yourself and decide.
 You understand, don?t you?
 Who?s there?!
 Who are you?!
 Judge D?Estaing?
 You have committed sins,
countless sins.
 What are you talking about?!
 Rubik is dead.
 You are next.
 Are you the one that killed Rubik?!
 Yes, but there are others who
are after you as well.
 I only came to warn you.
 Noir is after your life.
 Noir will bring death
to you without fail.
 There is no way for you to avoid it.
 The deadline is closing fast.
 Noir will surely act shortly.
 Who the hell are you?!
 One who inherits the name.
 The name of an ancient fate.
 Today is our deadline.
 That assassin may appear again.
 We?ll wait for that.
 We will target that chance.
 That is our style.
 So you?ve come.
 I see.
 You?re all very dedicated to your work
when it?s not part of your duties.
 You?re nothing but assassins.
Learn your place.
 You two don?t even have
the right to a trial.
 Let?s hear who hired you.
 You?re?
 Didn?t I tell you that Noir
would kill you?
 What?s your name?
 Chloe?
 Who are you?
 The true Noir.
 We can see who?s faster if you?d like.
 I am the true Noir.
 The soft touch
 Finally made me realize
how cold my cheek was
 Like waking up in the morning
 And noticing the birds chirping
for the first time
 Suddenly
 I don?t know anything yet
 What my heart is seeking
 I don?t know
 I was always looking up at the sky
 Like this, since who knows when
 I would send my thoughts
to right below that cloud
