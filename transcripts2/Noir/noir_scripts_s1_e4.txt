 Noir (2001–…): Season 1, Episode 4 - The Sound of Waves - full transcript 
 Mireille and Kirika are in a country called Ulgia to kill a group of people who make business out of destabilizing countries. While observing one of their targets, they witness the arrival of his daughter, the fifteen-year-old Rosaly, who has come uninvited to see her father on her upcoming birthday. When the group receives an anonymous tip as to the whereabouts of Noir, they call in a favor and the Ulgian military dispatches a number of soldiers to their location. The soldiers surround Mireille and Kirika in their house at the sea, but the girls manage to kill the soldiers and proceed with their assignment.

 Noir?
 It is the name of an ancient fate.
 Two maidens who govern death.
 The peace of the newly born,
 their black hands protect.
 Your Excellency,
 congratulations on your appointment
as Minister of Defense.
 Ah, it?s you, Tanner.
Thanks for coming.
 As a representative of the Atride
Corporation, I congratulate you.
 This is all thanks to you.
 Not at all.
 We believe it to be a direct result
of your innate virtues.
 Among the citizens, who consider
the president?s faction
 to be the source of their problems,
 I hear their hope for you, General
Canora, is definitely growing.
 Well, we?ll leave it at that.
 In any case, this is a big step forward
for your project as well.
 Ulgia now has a true leader and
you have gained a fortune.
 We are much obliged.
 Next year looks like it will be
a very fruitful year.
 Yes, Sir.
 This is a celebration in advance.
Please do enjoy yourselves today.
 Thank you very much, Sir.
 By next year, this country?s population
will have been halved.
 Hey?
 What is it?!
 Hey, Tanner!
 Tanner!
 [The Sound of Waves]
 An international security service.
 That is ostensibly what
Atride Corporation does.
 But they?re actually a
coup d?etat coordinator.
 They find regions with
potential for conflict
 and approach one of the
influential parties there.
 Then they offer to take care
of anything and everything
 from planning to training soldiers,
 deploying personnel,
and buying weapons.
 Quite a business, don?t you think?
 Say, did you bring a swimsuit?
 Swimsuit?
 But Your Excellency,
 we have already invested
a colossal sum in this.
 There is no turning back now.
 Yes, I came to Ulgia intending
to do just that.
 If you absolutely insist on
breaching our contract,
 we will be forced to disclose
the nature of our investment.
 If that happens, Your
Excellency will be?
 Yes, please carefully
reconsider. Goodbye.
 It seems that Canora has
completely lost his nerve.
 I?m not going to let him cancel.
 We?ve spent three years
planning for this project.
 The rights to work a mine or two
won?t make up for that.
 Do you suppose the people who
killed Tanner and Foster
 were from the presidential
faction after all?
 They don?t have to be.
 We?ve done work all over the world.
 It wouldn?t be surprising for it to be
anybody that hates us.
 That?s part of our business.
 Tanner and Foster were unlucky.
 But that?s all it was!
 There are always noxious pests
in filthy places.
 We can?t be bothered with each
and every one of them.
 But we?ll crush this one!
 We have three targets left.
 The president, Hammond, and
his men, Burke and Wellman.
 What a quiet sea.
 Yes?
 It?s so beautiful.
 It looks like he?s waiting for someone.
 There are guards in hiding.
 Four of them.
 No, there are six.
 Papa!
 Papa, did you wait long?
 Why did you have to come all
the way here uninvited?
 I am here in Ulgia on business.
 I?ll hear whatever you have
to say in New York.
 Ulgia or New York, it won?t
make a difference.
 I won?t get to see you anyway.
 You?ve always been like that!
That?s why Mama?
 In any case, you?re going home
on tomorrow?s flight.
 Can?t I stay until the day
after tomorrow?
 No!
 I knew it. You don?t even remember.
 Remember what?
 The day after tomorrow
is my birthday.
 You heard me, on tomorrow?s flight.
 Rosalie Hammond, fifteen years old.
 The only daughter of the
divorced Hammond couple.
 Currently, she lives with her mother,
Julia, in New York.
 The president sure has it rough.
 He?s so busy fanning disputes
in other countries,
 he hardly ever sees his daughter.
 School?
 When I came to, I was here.
 Who am I?
 I am Noir.
 Beyond that, I know nothing.
 Papa?
 Did I wake you?
 It?s okay.
 Rosalie?
 I know. I?ll go home on today?s flight.
 It doesn?t matter anymore. Mama?s
probably worried by now too.
 I made a call to Mama,
 to tell her that you?ll be coming
home next week.
 I believe it will take a while before
we find out who did it.
 We are currently in the process
 of looking into everyone
we?ve ever worked with.
 We will make sure the assassin and
his client pay for what they did.
 Stop the car.
 It?s open.
 Mr. President!
 What?s wrong?
 A strange letter arrived at the office.
 A strange letter?
 Noir?
 What is that?
 It?s the name of an assassin,
a top-class one at that.
 Then this is from an informant?
 Maybe it?s some kind of trap.
 But that makes no difference in that
 this is still a huge clue for us.
 There?s an Ulgian army
base near there.
 Immediately make arrangements
for them to send troops.
 I?ll have Canora do at least
that much for us.
 Understood, Sir.
 Ulgian troops.
 Over here too.
 How did they find us?
 I see. It?s THEM again.
 Fine. You think we can do it?
 She has no weapons!
 There?s no one inside either!
 Hey, what are you? What?s a girl
like you doing here?
 Where are you from?
 Where?s your passport?
 The roof!
 Retreat!
 They got away?!
 The scouting party that was annihilated
apparently charged in
 without waiting to join up
with the main force.
 We still don?t know the details
of exactly what happened,
 but it seems the army
is in chaos right now.
 You two head to the site right away.
 Report back to me in full.
 Yes, Sir!
 Damn it, how did it come to this?
 We?re just doing business.
 We wouldn?t have jobs if
there weren?t any clients.
 If you?re going to blame someone,
blame your own damn government.
 It?s too late to be complaining.
 Let?s go.
 It?s open.
 Here.
