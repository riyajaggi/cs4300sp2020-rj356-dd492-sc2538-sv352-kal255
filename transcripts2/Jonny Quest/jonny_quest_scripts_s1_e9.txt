 [engine whirring] (male #1) 'Anchorage tower, this is Zebra one-niner.' [instrumental music] Help! Help me! (man on radio) 'Joe! Joe, what's the problem?' Uh, everything's gone wild! My power's been cut. I'm gonna ditch in the water. (man on radio) 'Come in, Joe. Do you read me?' [crackling] [splashing] Oh! Whoo! Made it. I'm okay, just send out a tow for me.

 Hmm, mighty weird weather. (male #2) 'Aha! That will teach the land creatures.' 'You have done well, men.' With my flying dreadnought the air and everything in it is mine! If anyone wishes to enter my domain, they will pay or be destroyed. Soon, all land creatures will know of Dreadnought, Warlord of the Sky. Bring me his power, now! [crackling] [explosion] (Jonny) Can this weather balloon really track thunder clouds? (Dr. Quest) In a manner of speaking, Jonny. It can help map the recent wave of unexplained thunderstorms 'by detecting unusual electrical discharges like lightning.' Bandit does the same thing. 'Whenever he detects lightning, he hides under Jonny's bed.' [yapping] (Dr. Quest) 'Okay, let her go, Race.' Are you a mascot for the Quest team? Actually, I kinda break the ion distributer to read true for the upper troposphere. Uh, oh, very good, sir. Sorry. What's the big deal about following rain clouds? I don't get it. [barking] You shouldn't have said that, Jonny. [crackling] [sizzling] What in the world is that, doctor? Ball lightning? Hmm, I don't know, Race. I've never seen that before. Strange. [crackling] [bursting] Whoa! Did you see that? That cloud's using our balloon for target practice. [crackling] [bursting] whir (Dr. Quest) 'It's swallowing the lightning detector.' 'It's gone! It's moving.' - They're gone. - Yeah, and so is Bandit. - Bandit, here boy. Here boy! - Bandit! Come on, Bandit! [Bandit yapping] I guess we found one of those unexplained thunderstorms, doctor. That certainly was no natural thunderstorm, Race. 'It showed signs of intelligence and great power.' 'Staggering power.' (Race) 'So how do we find that cloud? The sky is full of 'em.' Well, anything displaying that much power creates magnetic fields at the same time. Fields that we can track with a hologram. - 'Are we the blue dot, dad?' - 'Right, Jonny.' (Dr. Quest) 'The red one indicates our destination.' I've got it. Course laid in, doctor. Due north. [engine rumbling] (Dr. Quest) 'Those magnetic readings are getting stronger, Race.' The readings start far off the scale. Wow! Look at that! (Dr. Quest) 'Incredible! It's an artificial aurora borealis.' Hang on everyone, we're in for a rough ride. Ever consider an alternative approach to going straight in, Race? It may be advisable. Yes, like going round back. [barking] - Bandit! - I've got you, pal. No way to break out of this. We're being sucked inside. (Dr. Quest) 'Head for the eye, Race. We might have a chance.' 'A fighting chance.' I'll never ride a rollercoaster for the rest of my life. [yelping] There it is! The end of the magnetic tunnel. (Race) 'Look at that! Unbelievable!' Wow! That's some welcoming committee. [crackling] (Race) 'They're too happy to see us.' A-ha! That airship generated the thundercloud. There's our trouble. '(Race)' No fooling, doctor. Let's give it a taste of our lightning. (Dr. Quest) 'Good idea, Race. Our particle beams may help us.' (Race) 'No. Our beams are useless, can't penetrate.' [sizzling] - Oh! Race! Race! - Look out! I see 'em, boys, but I can't dodge 'em. [zapping] (Race) 'Someone is steering those spheres, something inside.' (Hadji) 'Look!' [humming] [sonic humming] They've attached something to the wings and...aah! [crackling] Race! Race! The engines are dead. No thrust, we're losing altitude. [instrumental music] The engines won't start. - Can't we just glide in? - Yes, yes, glide. No! We'll crash unless we're under power. Gentlemen, the engines aboard Quester Two might provide adequate thrust. Good! Good thinking, Hard Rock. How about it, doctor? 'If we don't detach Quester Two, we might..' No! Not a chance, Race. Q-Two wasn't designed to handle that much stress. Forget it. Then someone better tell Jonny. Jonny, get back in your seat. We've gotta try it, dad! No time to argue. Of all the...he doesn't know how to start Quester Two's engines. (Race) 'Uh, y-yes, he does, doctor.' Sorry, but he talked me into giving him a few lessons. (Jonny) 'I'm starting ignition sequence, Race. Thrusters primed and engaged. Pressure is right. Main boosters are green. 'And ignite, now!' [engines roaring] Jonny, you did it! [all cheering] (Race) 'Quester One starting to respond, doctor.' - 'I think we can make it.' - 'Do you have enough power?' (Race) 'Well, one way or another, we're going in.' (Race) 'Pretty good landing, partner.' Phew! We did it, didn't we? (Dr. Quest) 'I'm proud of you, son.' Gee, thanks! Maybe next time I'll get to do some flying, huh? Huh, dad? It's just some fused capacitors. We'll have the engines back in no time. The sooner, the better. [Bandit barking] Okay if we scout around, dad? Not by yourselves, you're not. (Jonny) 'But Race is busy helping you. Please, dad, huh?' Alright, then Hard Rock will go along. whir [clanking] Huh! Guess not. You go ahead. I'll follow on foot. whir [bubbling] The island is completely deserted, Jonny. 'I don't like the look of it.' 'It's kind of spooky.' Yeah. I hope we get out of here soon. Real soon. [yelping] - Hey, Hard Rock! - We're up here. Be careful. [chomping] Hmm, unusual amount of beryllium in the lava. Someone's smelting titanium around here. Unusual! 'I wonder where that leads.' Interesting. Well, now let's test the engines. Good idea. Everything seems in order. Dr. Quest! Take cover! Ah, Hey! What the.. (Dr. Quest) 'That thing's projecting a magnetic field.' 'It has tremendous lifting power.' (Race) I see it, but I don't believe it. [sizzling] We've gotta make a break for the rocks. Let's go! [thunder crashing] [grunting] [thunder crashing] [grunting] I think we've lost Hard Rock. [Hadji chuckling] Think he's back there somewhere. whir Hadji, look! I bet they've got dad and Race. (Jonny) We've gotta follow 'em. Ah! Got it, Jonny! All aboard. - Whoa! - 'Hang on, we're going up.' [instrumental music] whir crash Don't let go, Hadji. Oh, no. No, but I wish you weren't so heavy. [metal creaking] Now, what do we do? (Jonny) Hope that they land this thing soon. Hey, pal, you get that glow from your warm personality? Just keep quiet and move. That looks like the glow from an electric charge, Race. (Dragna) 'Ah! So Dr. Benton Quest comes to visit me.' - Maximilian Dragna. - 'Yes, in the flesh.' You'd be honored to see the extent of my power. That's certainly one giant power station down there. [laughing] Yes, and years in development. And with it, I can destroy any city in the world. [bubbling] Ah! Memories of home. [rumbling] Earthquake? [rumbling] crash Hmm. Badly constructed. Inferior engineering. This hanging around is wearing me out. Jonny, look! Over there. (Jonny) 'Sure hope this thing doesn't land on it's belly.' [engine whirring] (Hadji) 'Now, let's jump!' (Jonny) 'First four electrical doodads and bad guys.' Everyone off. sniff sniff Don't look now, but there are uglies at 12 o'clock. (Jonny) 'We'll sneak around the other way.' [growling] [barking] (Hadji) 'Bandit, shhh!' Get them. [instrumental music] [crackling] (Hadji) Wow! Look at the light show. Looks like the fourth of July. Come on! Those goons are right behind us. Geronimo! - Hey, it's slick as ice. - 'Jonny!' I'm okay, it just tingled a little. Drop in, Hadji, come on. Whoa! [Bandit barking] crash Hey, what a ride! Wish we could do it again. Yes, not bad if you know where you're going. Come on, we got to find dad and Race. [music continues] (Jonny) I think we've lost the goons. Oops! Me and my big mouth. [sizzling] (Hadji) Quick, in here. Shhh! They'll never find us here. [sizzling] zap Gosh! We're lit up like a couple of night lights. [sizzling] Must be from that crazy room we slipped through when we got zapped. (Jonny) 'Come on, Bandit.' crash [instrumental music] Careful, I can't see my feet. And I can't see Bandit. [Bandit barking] Okay, Bandit, you can thank me later. - Whoa! - Jonny? Ah! (Jonny) Phew! Thanks. Looks like this the end of the line, Hadji.' [sizzling] (together) Uh-oh. (Hadji) 'Or the end of us!' Got any tricks in mind, Hadji? (Hadji) 'Yes, but first I'll make you and Bandit disappear.' - Duck down beneath the mist. - 'But what about you?' Ha! We've got you now you little.. Then come get me. Sim-sim-sala-bim. [both screaming] splash (Hadji) That is how we catch tigers in India. 'Very practical.' [rattling] We can sneak back inside through here. After you, Bandit. [yelping] Hmm, I don't know about this. Something tells me.. Ah, now, if I could only get my hands free. And so it ends here in my boiler room. [laughs] 'The geyser beneath this chamber heats my entire complex.' In a few minutes this room will be filled with super-heated steam. And you will meet your doom. [laughing] Where does this lead, Jonny? My guess is to a steam bath. arf arf arf Bandit! Bandit! [whimpering] He's gone. Uh-oh. Hadji! Right behind you, Jonny. Unfortunately! Dragna's men are real merit badge boy scouts. These knots just won't budge. Something had better give. The geyser's going to erupt, Race! [Bandit barking] It's Bandit. [Bandit whimpering] Ah! Bandit! Where'd you come from, boy? slurp - Yahoo! - Yahoo! thud Thought we'd just drop in, dad. Fine! Now untie us, boys, before the geyser blows. We've only a minute or two. Ah! These knots wont budge. [growling] [rumbling] (Jonny) Uh-oh, the geyser. We're out of time! Jonny, Hadji, Bandit get out of here. No dad, we won't. It's too late! Pardon me for the interruption. (together) 'Hard Rock.' Gentlemen, allow me. snap Very flimsy material. [grunting] This must be welded shut. Race, step aside. Allow me, it's elementary. clang That's what I like about you, Hard Rock. You have style. (Hard Rock) 'It's called, class.' (Race) Quiet now. I'll take the one on the left. (Hard Rock) 'I'll take the right.' Tag! You're it. [grunting] [grunting] (Race) 'Nice shot, Hard Rock.' [both groaning] (Benton) Hurry, we must destroy these generators or the world is doomed. 'Race, you and the boys get aboard Questor now, please.' No way, we're not leaving you behind, Dr. Quest. - You don't have to, I finished. - 'Dad!' (Dragna) 'Such a feeble attempt, Dr. Quest.' Don't move, 50,000 volts of electricity is pointed at each one of you. 'You've had it, Dr. Quest.' No! You've got it. crash Get them! Get them, you fools! That was too close for comfort. Make way, coming through! [engine whirring] That's what I call "pin the bad guy to the wall." zap zap zap No, Bandit! No, no, Bandit! I-I-I'm on your side. zap zap zap You stupid mutt. Give me that! Ah! (Hadji) 'Well, ask and you shall receive.' (Jonny) 'Yeah. And he really got a charge out of it too.' slurp Everyone on board, quick. We're pulling out right now. I've wired this place to explode in less than a minute. (Race) 'We're still attached to Dragna's ship.' [engine rumbling] Give it everything, Race, including the backup boosters. Here goes. [engine revving] (Jonny) 'We did it!' boom Yeah! - Well, I'm glad that's fini.. - Doctor, look! (Race) 'That guy just doesn't give up.' zap bang zap I can't shake him. I'll try our particle beams. zap Nothing will get through that electronic shield of his. Hadji, look at that! There's a hole 'in Dragna's electronic shield.' (Hadji) 'That's where we broke off that lightning rod.' - 'See it, Race?' - Bingo! But I'll only get one chance to hit it. [engine rumbling] So, they're attempting one final attack. How stupid. [laughing] I will blow them to bits! zap zap zap (Jonny) 'Direct hit, Race!' whir splash Well, that's the end of Maximilian Dragna. I'm not so sure, look! [sizzling] (Dr. Quest) 'You're going to glow for another week or so, boys.' How're we gonna get any sleep? [barking] slurp slurp (Jonny) 'Bandit, I've always thought you had an electric personality.' [laughing] [barking] [all laughing] [theme music] [music continues]
