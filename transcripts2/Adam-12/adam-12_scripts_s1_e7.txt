 She was 5'1" and a fast 102 wringing wet. Seems she and her husband were at each other's throats and the Sarge had to muscle the guy down to break 'em up. Next thing you know the woman's swinging from left field. He caught one. (Reed) He sure did. Family disputes. Boy, I really don't understand them. Now you take Jean and me, know what we did yesterday? We painted the bathroom. On your day off you painted the bathroom? That's right. And we had a ball, too. You're putting me on. (dispatcher) 1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12. A 415 fight, 2742 Melrose. Code Two. 1-Adam-12. Roger. [glass shattering] [people exclaiming] All right, you folks wanna break it up and move on, please? Hi, friend. What's the score? How should I know? All right. Knock it off. Knock it off. I might have expected something like this from you. Calling the Gestapo. Me! I'd sooner die first! That's enough. Both of you. There's some things I can't take from anybody. How did this get started? (Love) I was in the middle of worship when he came upon me like a wild thing and he started ripping up the Sanctuary. He was radiating-- Okay. Okay. Step over here with me. What's your name? Krishna the Seeker. Your real name. That is my true name. The one on your birth certificate. Norman Crane. Do you have any I.D? It's upstairs. Is that where you live? It is also my temple. Let's hear your side of this. Well, I arose this afternoon. We'd had a very rewarding though lengthy meditation last night. You should have been there. You could feel love amongst us like a physical living presence. Mmm-hmm. You wouldn't understand. Just get back to the problem. Well, as I began my meditations, I knew that I was on the verge of communion with infinity. A rapport with limitless love. I had no more than approached the threshold, when that creep started summoning the unknown with those god-awful bongo drums of his and that hideous chanting. Now who can meditate under conditions like those? Well, I've spoken to him about it over and over again. Naturally, I came down here to, uh, to reason with him. I see. Just wait here a minute. What've you got? Willis Janney. Prefers to be called Badmah. Padmah, you cretin. That's enough of that. Claims the other one broke in and started kicking in his drums for no reason at all. I had no more than begun my moment of solitude. That's the time I set aside myself every day to bring myself into attunement with the omnipresent vibrations of ineffable love. Love! The key. That's all there is. Crane, would you step over here please? Krishna, if you don't mind. Now, feeling the way you fellas do, you ought to be able to get along better. It strikes me that instead of fighting about it, you should work out something practical, some kind of an arrangement. Maybe stagger your hours of meditation or whatever it is you do, so you don't interfere with each other. Yes. A practical demonstration of the spirit of love. Well, if you're gonna believe him... So what if he is a cop? The point is he's an unbeliever. He knows more about it than you do. You and that bunch of stiffs up there looking for love in your navel. Silent meditation is the only true path. Only true path! Only true path? Crassness! Crassness and stupidity. You're sure not going to find the true path beating on a silly bongo. The music is simply a focus. A focus. Can't you get that through your thick skull? All right now. That's enough. Whatever you say to me, I still love you. That's the proof of who's right. You can't say that about me. I love you. I love everybody. Not the way I do. Love? You don't even know the meaning of the word. Are you all right? Yes. Now I think for the first time in my life, I can appreciate your role in society. Well, that's something anyway. Yes, indeed. Somebody's got to protect us from the rest of those kooks. (Reed) 1-Adam-12. Clear. (dispatcher) 1-Adam-12. Clear. Those two back there can't be for real. Wait till you've been around a while. The world is full of squirrels, and some days on this job, it seems like we get 'em all. Like that? If not like that, they got other hang-ups. I remember a girl, must have been three, four years ago. She almost drove the Division crazy. She was calling in two, three times a week with prowler complaints. What was it? Some guy with a fix on her? Not just some guy. Her boyfriend. They'd have a fight, she'd get mad and get us to bust him. Went on for months. What finally happened? They got married. And then everything was okay, huh? I don't know. They moved out of the Division, fortunately. Anyway, that guy back there, Willis Janney, I guess he finally won the argument, after all. I guess so. He gets knocked down and refuses to press charges. If that isn't love, it'll do. Well, they're still pretty far out for me. You think that's weird. I know a guy who paints bathrooms on his day off. Hey, don't knock it. Get yourself married first. Just can't stand to see a happy bachelor, huh? [car tires screeching] Look at that! [siren wailing] Looks like he's trying to lose us. Let's go get him. We got him. He's got no place to go now. Come on out of there. Let's go! Let's go! Hi, fellas. Put out a Four, Reed. I think we can handle this. Hope you are right. May I see your license-- Certainly, Officer. It's in my purse-- I'll get it. You stand right over here, please. Take it out of the purse, please. Now, Miss Wilson, what was this all about? This race we just had. It was fun, wasn't it? Fun? Real kicky. You boys really lucked out. If it wasn't for this stupid dead end, you'd never have caught up with me. Well, now we're gonna play the second half of the game. What's that? We are gonna go to the station and try and guess how many sections of the vehicle code you've violated in the last five minutes. You cops. I swear you're all alike. No sense of humor. Let's go. (dispatcher) All units in the vicinity and 1-Adam-12. 1-Adam-12. 211 silent, 895 Cordova. 1-Adam-12, Code Three. [siren wailing] 500. Three blocks. Must be that liquor store close to the corner. Yeah. That's them, get them! Stop them! Shoot them! Hold it! Police Officers. Shoot them! Kill them! Shoot them! [tires screeching] [siren wailing] All right. Hold it! Come out of there! Let's go! All right. Let's go. Step away from the wall. You got them! Lousy hoods. Your partner should have shot them. Would've saved time and trouble. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You be quiet. (man) You punk. What happened? They nearly wrecked my store. That's what happened. He wanted to buy beer on credit. Well, I wouldn't sell. Then they got mean. One of them kicked over a display, accidentally, if you know what I mean. Next minute they started busting up things. He's lying to his teeth. Come on now. I told you to button it up. You'll get your chance. Run 'em in. I'll press all the charges, they will spend the rest of their lives in jail. Did they show you a weapon? No. Then they didn't try to steal anything? No. No. Like I said they just busted up the store. Did you know you're only supposed to use a silent alarm in the case of an attempted robbery? Yeah. I guess, I lost my head. But somebody's gotta stop these punks sometime. Yes, sir, but we'll have to report this. On--on them? That, too. But also the fact you used a silent alarm unlawfully. You're kidding! No. I'm not kidding and I'll tell you something else. If my partner had listened to you, those kids could all be dead now. Maybe they'll learn they can't go busting up a man's place of business just because he won't sell a few beers. You can't blame the owner in a way. Six holdups in the last year. No wonder he hit the panic button. 1-Adam-12. Clear. (dispatcher) 1-Adam-12. Roger. Reed, back there at the liquor store, why didn't you fire? It didn't figure. What do you mean it didn't figure? It came out a 211. The owner sure acted like they were 211s. I figured we could catch them. Suppose I'm running a liquor store and three characters come in to rob me. They show me a gun. I'm looking down the muzzle of a barrel as big as a cannon. Somehow I manage to trip the silent alarm. Then what do I do? With that gun staring at me, I do exactly what they tell me. I give them what they want and I don't move a muscle. And I hope law arrives on time. It does. Code Three. The suspects hear the siren and bail out of my store. But if they've got a gun, do I chase them? Am I practically on their heels, hollering like a banshee? Heck, no, man. I sit tight and I stay as far away from that gun as I can. Like I said. It didn't figure they were holdup men, did it? You may earn that badge yet. What about the liquor store owner? That's up to the Commission. Like I told him, they issued the permit for the silent alarm. They can take it away. (dispatcher) 1-Adam-12. 1-Adam-12. See the woman. 415 party, 627 Regna Street. 1-Adam-12. Roger. N[music playing] Thank heavens, it didn't take you long! What's the trouble? Over there. Across the street. Twice I asked her and very nicely, mind you. Very nicely. And do you think she'd turn it off? I declare, I don't know what's happening to the new generation. May I have your name, please? Uh, n-never you mind my name! You just go and make her turn that thing off and you lock her up. My partner's going to talk to her. Talking is no good. I told you. Not 15 minutes ago I tried that. Oh, mercy, I do believe she's insane. How do you mean? Well, not two minutes ago, she came flying over here, screaming and banging on my door. I thought she was gonna knock it down. What did she want? Do you think I'd answer my door when a crazy person bangs on it in the night? Or at any time for that matter. Oh, dear. Insane. That's what she is. The nerve of that woman. Leaving her child with--with that thing. I'm afraid I don't understand, ma'am. That insane baby-sitter. She can't be more than 14. The idea. Now you just go right over there and you lock her up. (Malloy) Reed. Excuse me, ma'am. [knocking on door] I can't raise anybody. You wanna check around back? [woman coughing] (Karen) Help! [Karen gasping] (Karen) Please help! Help! (Reed) Malloy! Malloy! Get her. Please get her. 1-Adam-12. Requesting an ambulance at 629 Regna. Possible drowning. (dispatcher) 1-Adam-12. Roger. Miss? Miss? I don't know how to swim. We need some blankets. I don't know how to swim. Come on. Go in the house and get us some blankets. And turn some lights on out here. Turn off the music. Ambulance is on the way. Doesn't look good. Pool like this should have a fence all the way around it so kids can't get in. Yeah. Cissie. Cissie. Cissie. Cissie. [sobbing] [ambulance siren wailing] She ran outside. I couldn't find her. I tried to get help but nobody would come. Nobody would help me. [panting] We were having fun. She didn't want to go to bed. (Reed) In here. All right, folks. Clear back out of the way, please. Can you tell us anything, miss? Huh? You said she ran outside. We were goofing around. Dancing and playing hide-and-go-seek. I couldn't find her. I heard her laughing out here. She was standing on the edge. And I yelled at her. She fell in. What's your name? Karen. I live two blocks from here on Wilmont. She'll be all right, won't she? You poor thing. Of course, she will. Now you come on into the house with me and we'll get you out of these wet things. And everything's going to be fine. Just fine. Now you'll see. Now come on in. Mrs. Stockton? What do you want? There are a few things we have to know for our report. The child's name. Her parents. Maybe Karen can tell us how we can get in touch with them. Her mother's divorced. I'm sorry. I don't know where she is tonight. Uh, the child's name is Cissie Franklyn. Her mother. Well, her mother goes out with men. Uh, the rest of your report can wait. You wring yourself out. I'll see if I can get a line on Mrs. Franklyn. Malloy. Yeah? She said she was glad we got here fast. I wonder if we were in time. Thank you, Mrs. Stockton. Found her address book. Mrs. Franklyn? Yeah. She was at a party. Somebody's driving her to the hospital. I don't think she's going to make it, Malloy. Cissie. People die everyday. ADW. Hit-run. Murder. Most of the time we're involved. Somehow you learn to live with it. But I'll tell you something. When it happens to a child, you never get used to it. Let's go get you some dry clothes. 1-Adam-12. Up to the station. (dispatcher) 1-Adam-12. Roger.
