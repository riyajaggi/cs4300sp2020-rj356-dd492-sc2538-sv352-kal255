 Well, you know, 17 maybe. (Reed) Kind of cute. A nice smile. She asked if my wife was home and I said no. So I asked if maybe I could help. What about the contest? Wait a minute, I'm getting to that. Her name was, uh, Larson, Ruth Larson, I think that was it. Anyway, she said she was finishing high school and was gonna work her way through college. So you asked her in. How did you know? I just guessed. Middle of the morning. Things are kind of dull. That's right. Besides it was kind of chilly outside. What are you gonna do, No, no. slam the door in her face?

 Naturally, you ask her in. Right. So she came in and I gave her a cup of coffee. Then she told me. She told you what? About the contest! Oh, yeah, yeah. The contest. Uh, it was a kind of popularity contest. She was in it with a couple of hundred other kids. And the one who got the most votes would win a scholarship. So I said naturally I'd vote for her. Oh, I bet you did. Look, I'm dying to hear the rest of your story but if we don't going, we're going to be late for roll call. 1-Adam-12, PM, watch clear. (female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12, clear. Where was I? You were getting to the part where she told you about the contest. That's right. So, anyway, I told her I'd vote for her. No problem. How were you supposed to record your vote? Did she have a ballot box with her? Oh, all I had to do was sign this form. Then Jean came in. And, uh, anyway, you know what it was about? Magazines. Yeah, it was a come-on for magazines. The more magazines I bought, the more votes she got. And not votes either, commission, it had nothing to do with a college scholarship. You knew it all the time! Mmm-hmm. Can you imagine a nice kid like that? What was the idea of the big story? If she was selling magazines, why didn't she just say so? I'd a bought one. Did you? No. Jean wouldn't let you, huh? Did I say that? No. We didn't need any more magazines. Sure you didn't. We had all we wanted. Sure, you did. Anyway, thought I'd tell you. In case you answered your door some day. Right. So you'll know what to do. Right. I'll call Jean, have her come over and kick the girl out. (female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12. Juvenile narcotics suspect. See the doctor at Central Receiving Hospital. 1-Adam-12. Roger. What's the name? I'll see if she was brought in here. Hi, Malloy. Hello, Sally. You boys here on the name case'? That's fight. Just a second. What a day this one's been. No, I'm sorry, no one by that name's been brought in here. He's down the end of the hall. Doctor Komarski has him. The kid's name is Harvey Franklin. He's 15 years old. Thanks, Sally. See you later. (Reed) 15. You think they'd have more sense. Not think, partner. You hope they'd have more sense. Come on, in. (Malloy) How's he doing? Not so well. He was really out. What with? (Dr. Komarski) A mixed bag. The whole bit. Bennies, barbs you name it. I was just telling his father. It's a lucky thing he brought him in. If we hadn't stomach-pumped him, he'd be dead. Drugs. I had no idea. You could've knocked me over with a feather. All right, Smitty. Just a minute. (Malloy) Can he talk? It's all he can do to breathe. Where you putting him? In a ward. We get a lot of traffic through here. Oh, and don't worry. He'll be here when you want him. He's not going anywhere. We gotta make a report. When will he be able to talk? Tomorrow. Lets go, S m itty. (Malloy) Mr. Franklin. Yes? Just a moment please. Can't it wait? I'd like stay with my son. I'm sorry, Mr. Franklin, we have to ask you a few questions. Harvey Franklin is his full name? Yes. He's 15? 15 and a half. Address? 2416 La Pal ma. Has he ever used drugs before? Certainly not. At least I've never seen him. Sometimes, when things are slow I stop by my home in the afternoons. I'm a salesman. When I walked in, at first I--l thought he was sick. He was staggering all over the place. I ask him and he didn't say anything. Nothing. L--l didn't smell liquor on his breath. I didn't know what it was. And he started acting kind of wild. And I got scared. We only live a couple of blocks from here, so I drove him over here. Drugs. I--l just can't believe that. Do you have to arrest him? Probably. But he's only a boy. What's gonna happen to him? That's not up to us. That's handled by Juvenile Narcotics. Do you have any idea where he got them? The drugs? The medicine chest maybe. Did your doctor prescribe sleeping pills or peps? No, nothing like that. What about his friends? Well, that'll be hard to say. He runs with a whole gang from his high school. Would you look at this jacket? Brand-new. Bought it for him couple of weeks ago. Already it's all beat up. It's a mess. You know, kids his age, are sure rough on clothes, aren't they? Well, that's not-- that's not Harvey's. Oh! (Franklin) No, that's-that's a club he--he-he's going with, but he's not a member yet. This--this must be Larry's. Who's Larry? Larry Harris. He's older than Harvey. I'm not sure he's been a good influence on... That's who he got 'em from. Larry Harris. Here. Put them back in the jacket, Mr. Franklin. [sighing] Where does Larry live? Just around the corner from us. On Skidmore. You know the number? Yes, it's, uh, 22410 Skidmore. It's--it's a big apartment house. You can't miss it. You're gonna pick him up, right? We'll check it out. Well, you better hurry. Because the Harris' are due to leave on a trip today. They might've already gone. Can you give us a description of Larry? Yeah, I guess so. He's--he's 17 years old. He's kind of tall, about 6'1". Dark hair. He's thin and he wears glasses. Will that do it? Yeah, that'll be enough. You wanna call in, see if they've got anything on him. And what kind of a car do the Harris' drive? R and I doesn't have anything on him. Let's get out and see whether Larry Harris is about to start himself a package. Nice collection, huh? Yeah. Nice and lethal. Like the doctor said it's a wonder he didn't wind-up dead. Well, it sure wasn't a lack of trying on his part. I'd say that for him. You, uh, think this Larry Harris is in business. You, know, peddler. I don't know, could be. And Harvey might've picked up pills someplace after he walked off with the jacket. Yeah, it's not too likely, is it? I don't think so. Anyway, we'll probably wind-up turning that Harris kid over to Juvenile. Let them untangle it. 1-Adam-12, Code 6 at 22410 Skidmore. On a narco follow-up from Central Receiving. (female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12, Code 6. 22410 Skidmore. [doorbell rings] (Mrs. Harris) Who is it? Police Officers. Yes? What is it? We'd like to talk to you. Can come in please? Well, I--l suppose it's all right. But what do you want? Mrs. Harris, do you have a son named Larry? Yes. But what is it? Has he done something? Is this his jacket? Oh, you found it. He's been looking all over for it. We'd like to talk to him, Mrs. Harris. Is he around? Well, yes, he's in his room. But what is it? Talk about what? About the jacket. Where's his room? In there. The first door. But I don't understand what this is about! You can't just come in here like this, can you? Narcotics, Mrs. Harris. Narcotics? (Reed) Dangerous drugs. Does your son know a Harvey Franklin? Harvey? Well, yes, he lives around the corner. At the moment, he's in the hospital, Mrs. Harris. The hospital? That's right. We'd like to talk to Larry about it. Larry. Open the door. [doorknob rattling] Open the door, Larry. Mrs. Harris, why don't you stand over here? Larry. Police officers. We'd like to talk to you. Larry, if you don't come out, we'll have to come in. [gun firing] (Larry) That's just to let you know I've got a gun. Now leave me alone. Leave me alone or I'll kill myself. Do you hear? I swear I'll kill myself! Don't you come in here or I'll do it now. Do you hear me? How do you figure it? I don't know. I never got into one like this before. Well, we gotta do something. We can start by getting the Sergeant over here on the double. Right. You can tell him it's a nice clean-cut situation. We can't use gas because we're on the tenth floor with nothing across the street. And no other access. So we either kick the door, or talk him out, or walk away and leave him in there. It's a beaut, all right. Mrs. Harris. Mrs. Harris, we're gonna need your help. What can I do? For a start, you better tell us all about Larry. Like how serious do you think he is about this? You mean, you want me to tell you whether my son would really kill himself? How would I know? Do you think I understand any of this? Do you think I understand him? My own son involved with drugs, in there with a gun. The police in my home like this. Oh, if only his father would just come back. I can't cope with any of this. I understand how you feel, Mrs. Harris, but we're gonna have to do something. Why do you have to do something? Why can't you just go away and leave us alone? My husband and I can work this out with Larry if you'd just go away and leave us alone. Believe me, I wish we could. I wish it was that simple. I talked to the Lieutenant. He's sending a Sergeant over as quick as he can. He said to sit tight till then. Not much else we can do. Flo, I'm back. Everything's taken care of. What are the police doing here? What's going on? Are you Larry's father? That's right. Now just suppose you tell me what this is all about. I demand to know what you're doing here? All right, take it easy, Mr. Harris. I'm Officer Malloy, that's Officer Reed. We're here to talk to your son in connection with a narcotics investigation. Larry involved with narcotics? My kid? Well, it's ridiculous. Who's been telling you things like that? Where is he? I'll get this straightened out. He's in his room. Well, have you talked to him? No, we haven't. He's got a gun in there. And he won't come out. He says that if we try to come in, he's gonna kill himself. Kill himself? Don't you worry, I'll knock that out of his head. Why'd you let him get the gun for? I leave for five minutes. Don't you do anything right? Mr. Harris, when you talk to him, take it kind of easy, huh? Easy? What do you mean? He's right on the edge. You yell at him, he might just do it. He does what I tell him! Did you tell him to take drugs? He listens to me. I'm his father! I wouldn't stand right in front. What? (Mr. Harris) Larry did that? Fool kid. Larry, you come out of there. (Larry) Get away. Did you hear me? I hear you. Now leave me alone. Larry, come out. there, will you? You're holding up our trip. Thanks. But I'm on my own trip! You'll get a trip... Come out of there! Don't come in here. Don't you come in or I'll do it now! Do you hear me? L--l don't understand. Larry, think what you're doing to your mother. What you're doing to me. (Larry) I don't hear you. I do not hear you. Come on, Larry, you don't want to do this. Open up the door. Sure open the door so I can go to jail, right? Nobody knows if you'll go to jail or not. At the moment, all we want to do is talk to you. That's right, just talk. That's all we wanted to do in the first place, talk to you. (Larry) You're lying. (Malloy) Come on, Larry, open the door. Oh, come on out of there! Do what you're told. (Larry) You're always telling me what to do. You're always telling. Well, 10 minutes. I'm gonna do it in 10 minutes. John, did you have to? Listen, he's got no right. A son's got to obey his father. He's got no right. Why don't we break in? We might surprise him. Yeah. And we might not. We can't wait for the Sergeant. He's just bluffing. He hasn't got the guts to shoot himself. What about his friends? ls there somebody he might listen to. We don't know his friends. What about-- Flo, quit interrupting. We're trying to figure. No. Go ahead, Mrs. Harris. Well, there's a girl. His girlfriend? Well, she was. Are you're talking about Annie? Yes. She won't be any help. I busted that up a month ago. They haven't been going together since. Are you sure of that? What do you mean? They might be going together without you knowing it. Where does she live? Just downstairs. Why don't you go down and talk to her? Mrs. Harris, would you come with me? Now wait a minute. You're bringing her here? Mr. Harris, he said 10 minutes. Now have you any better ideas? Go ahead. [door closes] Larry? What time you got, Larry? (Larry) Not much, I can tell you that! (Malloy) I just wanted to double check so we knew where we stood, I make it 8 minutes. That much? That's what I've got. I thought it would go faster. No, eight minutes. You don't mind if we talk, do you? Talk? What do I care? I only have to listen for a couple of more minutes. Not a couple, Larry. Eight. You won't shortchange us, will you? You promised eight minutes. Yeah, yeah, I promised. And I promised what I'd do then, didn't I? I promised that too! How much longer? Six minutes. The bell works, I heard it. Somebody's got to be home. Doesn't look that way. [yelling] Hello? We better get back. He can't be serious about it, can he? It's unlocked. Annie? Annie? (Mrs. Harris) Annie. Annie? Are you asleep? Wake up. Oh, hello, Mrs. Harris. I didn't hear you. (Annie) Groovy. What's he doing here? What do you want? Annie, Larry says he going to kill himself. Oh, come on. Are you for real? Yeah, it's for real. He locked himself in his room, He's got a gun. Larry? Look, uh, if he's high I don't know anything about it. He kept trying to get me to take that junk, but I never even tried it. Annie, you've got to talk to him. You're serious, aren't you? We sure are and it better be fast. But what can I say? You're his girlfriend, aren't you? No, not anymore. Annie, it's not your fault that you and Larry haven't been seeing each other. Larry's father insisted. No, you don't dig, Mrs. Harris. It was after. We split up after. It had nothing to do with what his father said. Look, we can't stand around. Now you can give it a try, can't you? Yes, but I don't know what to say. We'll think of something. Now come on. He's my son. I just can't stand by and let this thing happen. All right, take it easy, Mr. Harris. We know how you feel. You think so, huh? Tell me something, you got kids of your own? No, I don't. Then don't tell me you know how I feel. I gotta do something. Must be some way I can get that dumb kid to come out of there. You got any ideas, anything at all, don't keep 'em to yourself. Not now. Ahhh, I can't think. I just can't think. There must be something you can do. Not much. Either he comes out or we go in after him. Look, couldn't you just go away and let me handle this. You had your chance to handle it. For all of Larry's life up to an hour ago. Now it's our problem and we can't just walk away from it. Look, he's emotionally disturbed or high or both. If we leave, he could go ahead and kill himself. Or you or your wife or somebody else. It happens, you know. Either he comes out or we gotta go in after him. There's no third choice. [door opening] Got here as soon as I could, Malloy. Watch Commander filled me in. Any change? Some. Kid's still holed up in his bedroom. But, about five minutes ago he said if we didn't leave, he was gonna pull the trigger on himself in 10 minutes. Reed and his mother have gone downstairs to get his girl. I figured maybe she could talk him out. That's his father. Sounds like we don't have a whole lot of time to work it out. Can you think of anything I might've missed? Not offhand. Parents tried to talk him out? Yeah. And he's still in there. If the girl can't do it, we'll have to kick the door. If he's on the edge, we might just push him over. The way I figure either he's made up his mind or he hasn't. And if he has, he'll be dead in about four minutes. Unless we take him first. [sighs] Yeah. [door opens] (Sergeant) This the girl? Yeah. (Reed) Yeah. Her name's Annie. This is Sergeant MacDonald. All right, Annie. You know what it is we want you to do? Yes. But I don't think I can. (Malloy) You can try. You wanna help Larry, don't you? I'm scared. Oh, Annie. Suppose I say the wrong thing? Then it'd be my fault! I told you she couldn't do any good. John, will you shut up? Will you for once shut up? (Reed) Come on, Annie. So you split up? You still care about him, don't you? I guess so. Well, then tell him that. Tell him how you feel about him. Well... Try and give him some kind of reason to go on living. What is it now? About three minutes? Yeah, about. How serious do you think he is? I don't know. (Sgt) It could be rough, but, if she can't bring him out, we'll just have to go in and get him. Yeah. You folks stay here, will you please? Larry? Larry, it's me, Annie. Why don't you cool it? Larry, please. So we had a blowup, I'm still your girl. [whispering] Tell him to come out. Larry, come out. We'll talk. Larry? Open the door, Larry. Larry? For me? [whispering] You love him. Go on. Larry. I love you. Listen, I'm sorry we split up. Larry, don't. Please, Larry? (Larry) Get away, girlfriend. Some girlfriend! You told the cops, didn't you? You told them that I've been pushing and I sold to that jerk, Harvey, and the rest of 'em. (Annie) No! Don't you lie to me. 'Cause I know you finked. They found out, didn't they? You told them, you must have. No, Larry! Shut up, shut up, shut up. [thudding] Shut up, all of you. Please. Just shut up. I blew it, didn't I? It's all right. Go on in the other room. Harris. This is Sergeant MacDonald. You been giving everybody a lot of trouble. Now knock it off. Put down the gun. Open this door and come out. You have 10 seconds to think it over. 'L, 2, a, 4... Freeze! All right, now, turn around. Put your hands up and leave them there. Where'd you put the gun? I don't have it. I threw it on the bed. I should've done it. I should've done it. This gets me nothing. Nothing. It gets you time, Larry. Time to change your mind. (Reed) How about that? Dark already. Time flies. It sure has tonight. Anyway, about that kid in the hospital, Harvey? He's okay. Yeah, I heard. Hey, I just realized, we haven't had seven yet. Where do you want to eat? Oh, I don't know. We'll find a place. [car engine starting] 1-Adam-12. Clear.
