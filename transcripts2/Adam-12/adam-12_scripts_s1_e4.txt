 Yeah, I'll bet. Jim Reed, Jerry Miller and Dave Hudson, two of our real live detectives. How you doin'? You work with Malloy, huh? Yeah. I swear they're gettin' younger all the time. Just to look at you makes me feel old. You are old. I got to be tied to this thing 8 hours everyday. Malloy giving you a bad time? No. If he ever does, you let me know, huh? Better listen to him, he's a Sergeant. He's showing you the ropes all right? How to write up a greenie, handle a deuce,

 good places to eat, that sort of thing? Oh, yeah. I guess Malloy's taught you about everything he knows then. It's about all he has to know. There's a little more to it than that. Jerry, what beats me, is how you ever made detective. (Jerry) Just raw talent, that's all. I heard it was because you couldn't read the hot sheet without moving your lips. Let me tell you, we had a case in here last month-- That was the only case you had last month. We leave all the volume business to you guys. I'll tell you something else. We're really interested, Jerry. I'd love to hear the rest of your story, but we got to get to roll call. You know how it is. Sure. Try not to trip out there on the pavement, Malloy. Malloy, do all detectives act like those two back there? What do you mean? You know, needling us like that just because we work uniform? Acting superior. They were just kiddin' around. They put in their time in black-and-whites, just like anybody else. I suppose they figure their jobs are more important, but that's only natural. Most guys feel like that if they have any pride in their work. I guess it is more interesting in a way. At least they get to see how their cases come out. Which is more than we do half the time. But then there's times when they'll work on an investigation for 6 or 7 months, and wind up in a dead end, or with the case kicked out of court. In our job, we don't get that involved. We don't have time to. Have you ever thought about trying it? Detective, I mean. Yeah, it's not bad work. Like I said, it's got its good points, just like anything else. (female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12, see the woman, a missing child, 2911, West Oakmont. 1-Adam-12, roger. Anybody, home? (Mrs. Bussey) Officers! Did you find him? Find who, ma'am? [panting] Take your time, get your breath. I'm sorry. I'm generally very calm and collected. He's run away, I know it. What's his name? Mark. Last name? Bussey. B-U-S-S-E-Y. He's only four. When did you see Mark last? It's a half hour, 35 minutes now. Did you search the house? I looked around, yes. Do you mind if I looked through? Oh, if you think it'll do any good. Sometimes they hide under the bed or inside closets. You said he ran away. Were you going to punish him or something? He was pestering me. And he made a mess with the ice tray in the kitchen. I was baking a casserole and I turned my back to wash my hands, he was gone. What was he wearing? Blue jeans, black little sneakers, a long sleeved pullover shirt, yellow. I wouldn't be too upset, Mrs. Bussey. He probably hasn't gone far. We'll have a look around the house. I'll take the back and the garage. Yeah. Here he is. What's he doing in there? Watching a cat. Must be ours. We have one. Mrs. Bussey, you now have five, and I wouldn't swear that's the final score. He's probably gonna have a few questions for you. I don't care. I'm just so glad to know that he's safe. And when I get him out of there, I'm going to kill him. Kids are really somethin', aren't they? Yeah. I remember one time 10 of us spent half a watch looking for a couple of 6-year-olds. Finally found them in the trunk of a neighbor's car. Were they okay? They were just fine. Turned out they'd climbed in and slammed the lid. What'd they do that for? Said they just wanted to see what it would be like. Kids. [chuckles] Yeah. [hollers] I wonder what Teejay wants? Hi- Hi, Teejay. What's up? Well, I tell you it's like this, man. I heard this scufflin'. Like shovin' around in the room back of mine. It sounds like there was a fight. Yeah. It sounded like two guys goin' at it. And then all of a sudden, I heard these two, three yells like, ?m, Hey I think somebody got hurt. You're at the Dorado? Yeah. I was fixin' to go out anyway, and then I heard the door. Sol peeked out and saw this guy takin' off. And I swear, he had blood on his sleeve. What'd he look like? He was dark, little taller than me. Kind of on the heavy side. What was he wearing? White shirt, dark pants. And I saw this red-like, on his sleeve, you know, when he was taking off. And, man, he was squirrelin' it out of there. How long ago was this? 20 minutes, maybe. Did you try the other room? Talk to anybody about it? No. You should've called it in, Teejay. Man, you know... Yeah. We'll take a look. You still work in the same place? Yeah, but it's gettin' to be a drag, man. You stayin' clean, aren't you? Oh, I ain't had a taste in, I don't know when. Hang in there, man. Do you think it's anything? Could be. He's turned us on to one or two others. 1-Adam-12. Code 6 at 11th and South Front. The Hotel Dorado. (female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12, roger. Can't you keep this place quiet, Benny. Heck, we're quiet, Malloy. You know anything about a fight maybe half-hour ago? Third room from the back on the left. No. Who you got in there? That'd be number six. Looks like Walsh. Richard, Robert, crummy handwriting. Came in last night. Is he there now? I don't know. Lot of times they use the back. We heard there might've been serious trouble. We'd like to take a look. Sure, go ahead. Walsh! Police officers, Walsh. You want me to go get the key? Walsh. Don't touch anything. I didn't leave any prints. If you close it, how are we gonna get it open without touching the knob? He's dead. Yeah. Probably some identification in his wallet. Leave him alone. Come on. Don't let anybody in. You want me to see if the people in these other rooms heard anything? Just stay on the door. Can I use the phone, Benny? Everything all right? Looks like there's been a killing. Hey, you're putting me on? There's a fellow back there who's been stabbed about three times. I didn't hear a thing. I mean... I swear I didn't hear a sound. Yeah. This is 1-Adam-12, Malloy. We have a DB, probable homicide. 1104, South Front Street. Dorado Hotel. Notify detectives and make the notifications. That's all you need from me, isn't it? That's about it. ls the coroner on the way? Uh, yeah. I'll take off then. Did either of you handle anything in there? Yeah, I touched the outside knob and the top of the door. All right, How about you? No, nothing. I'll have to get your prints in order to eliminate them. Oh, go ahead. I've got his name. Malloy, if it's okay with you, we'll make a report. Sure. What's your serial number. 10743. R-E-E-D. Yeah, James A. 13985. What time did you get here? 5:15. And the room's just like you found it? All we did was walk in, make reasonably sure he was dead and walk out again. We closed up the room, stayed by the door until you got here. Real good. You don't know who he is, though? Not for sure. I got a description of the man registered in the room from the manager. That's the manager? Yeah, the victim's name is Richard or Robert Walsh. The description matches the body. We'll get into all that with him, I guess. Um, this informer of yours, Teejay, do you know his full name? Theodore Joseph Sims. One 'M'. What is he, a hype? He used to chip around some. We haven't seen any marks on him in a couple of months. Where is he now? You know the Greater Southwest Produce Company? Yeah. He'll be on the loading dock till about midnight. We'll go down and question him. Will he talk to us? Well-- I don't see any reason why not? Sure. Then we might as well do it. ls there anything else? Nothing I can think of. You fellows might as well take off. We can stick around for a while and maybe give you a hand questioning some of these people. Ah, thanks, but, uh, I think we can make it. Come on, Reed, let's go. Ah, sir, could I speak to you for a minute? Burns me up. Uh-huh. That was a real good case. Our man put us on to it, we found it and we got to give it to somebody else and just walk away. That's the way it is. There's no point gettin' all bent out of shape about it. We could've talked to Teejay. We might've done some real good. Miller and Hudson will make out all right with him. Clear us. If you'd have let me push a little bit, we could've stuck around there a while and helped them out. Probably. 1-Adam-12, clear. Why didn't you? While we're back at the hotel, who's coverin' here on the street? The dicks have their job and we have ours. It's that simple. (female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12, clear. End of call. See the man. 586, private property. I'll bet you that's-- 912, South Grand Street. Cullen again. He's a character. 1-Adam-12, roger. How many times we've been here now? Four? Four. And he still hasn't got the signs right. Afternoon, Mr. Cullen. I telephoned you nearly an hour ago, right? We were tied up on another call. Same trouble, I suppose. You suppose? 'Course it's the same trouble. There's the trouble. There they are. Go ahead, start puttin' tickets on 'em. I'm afraid we can't do that, Mr. Cullen. You remember, we went all over this with you for half an hour the day before yesterday. And I did everything you said. I made up the signs, I put the cockamamie numbers on 'em. I hung 'em up. Mr. Cullen. Now you say you can't do anything. You can't see that sign till your halfway on to the lot. And that sign's not even posted properly. And that's it, huh? We went over and over it. The signs have to be clearly visible. Okay. Mr. Cullen, hold on a minute. You want 'em visible I'm makin' 'em visible, huh. Mr. Cullen, will you hold on a minute? I agree with you. You're 100% right. You couldn't see the sign when it's lying on the ground. Okay. What else did we tell you about the signs? We told you that they had to be legally worded, right? What's the matter with my sign? Any dumbo could read it. Look, I charge 75 cents a day to park here, right? $15 a month. But nobody pays me nothin'. This is private property. Write it out. They just can't come in here and park. What do I do to make 'em pay me. Mr. Cullen, you just don't listen. We've been over this with you and over this with you and you just don't pay attention. I do. You say "put up signs," I put up signs. Will you listen to me? Now, are you listening? Yeah, I'm listening. These signs are no good. It's private property. They want to park in here-- Just keep quiet and listen to me. You just can't put up any old sign. The law and the court say the signs have to be worded in a particular way. You understand. Yeah, I understand. That's what you said the last time. I understand, I understand. You're not goin' to do anything, right? Mr. Cullen... This is what the signs have to say. Well, this don't say nothin' more than my sign says. What am I supposed to do, just keep on making signs? If they don't pay attention to mine, they won't to these. Mr. Cullen, we can't keep goin' over this. Now you get some signs made like that and you post 'em properly. And if you've got 100 cars parked in here illegally, we'll write you 100 citations 'cause that's our job. But till you do that, don't keep calling us down here. 'Cause there's nothin' we can do. Is that clear? All right. You want to bet he doesn't call us again. No. Well, you said it. The detectives have their job and we have ours. Why don't we take a run over and have a talk with Teejay. What's the point? I might dig something out of him they missed. Not likely. Boy, you really want to get into the act, don't you? Well, it was our call. And now it's their case. They act like we couldn't handle it. That's not the way it is at all. (female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12, 1-Adam-12. See the woman, a family dispute. 2641, West Van Arden. That's the way it seems to me. 1-Adam-12, roger. They can spend the next three weeks, or longer, runnin' around on that murder. It's not whether it's important or not. They've got the time and we don't. That's the point. Yeah, sure. [doorbell buzzing] (Malloy) Police officers! What's the trouble? Oh, hi. (Malloy) Can we come in? Sure, sure. Come on in. What's the trouble here? Oh, nothing really. Where's your wife, Mr. Beuhler? Well, uh, she locked herself in the bedroom. L--l didn't even know she called you fellows. Good, you're here. Now raise a hand to me. Go on, go on. Now, go on. Hold it down! Do it in front of witnesses. I dare you to. Cut it out, both of you. What's the matter with you? Are you out of your mind? I never touched her. All right, will you settle down, please? And what are these marks? Where did I get them? Reba, cover yourself up, please-- All right, get over here! What's the matter with her? Showing herself like that. Well, look! Yeah, I saw. Well, he threw a bottle at me. I did not. Now that's a lie! Now knock it off, both of you. Let me see some identification. What's going on here? Well, he came home. I knew, I knew, right from the start what kind of a mood he was in. And he asks me-- Would you stand right back over here, please? What's for supper? So I told him. Ravioli. Well, that's when it started. He started yellin' and cursin' and calling it slop. Sol picked up the dish and I threw it in the garbage. And that's when he grabbed me and he started hauling me all over that kitchen. You saw the marks he put on me. What about the scratch on your face? Oh, I didn't notice. Is it big? No. He must have done it with a fingernail. Is that all? Well, isn't that enough? I mean, he threatened to knock me silly. I'm scared to be in this house with him. You got to get him out of here. Take it easy, Mrs. Beuhler. You want us to take him to jail? Jail? Uh-huh. No, I--I--I just want you to get him out of here. Well, he lives here, doesn't he? Yeah. Then we can't do that. Suppose he gives you his word that he won't do anything violent or threaten you. Will that be all right? Well, I don't know. I mean, you don't know what I've been through with that man. And that stupid wine of his. Well, I'll talk to him. Look, you--you got to hear my side of it. I'm a good manager. For eight years I've made do with what he gives me. Mrs. Beuhler, you're tying up two police officers and a radio car. I really can't go through the whole eight years with you. Just wait here, please. Apparently, it's been goin' on for quite awhile. Money mostly. Tonight's dinner kicked it off again. Yeah. Ravioli and spaghetti, three times a week, right out of a can. Pure carbohydrates and I'm tryin' to watch my weight. If your wife insists, we're gonna have to take you to jail. Are you kidding? She says you assaulted her and there's some evidence to back it up. People say a lot of things when they're fighting that they don't mean. She claims you threw a bottle at her. Well, uh, I like good imported wine and she started throwing up the cost of it to me. I had about two-thirds of a bottle in the refrigerator. I was nursing it. A real good Ch?teauneuf du Pape. I took it out and I threw it in the sink. Oh, I really showed her. Oh, but I wouldn't hurt her. I mean it. Why don't you tell her that. Maybe that would settle it. And we could all go about our business. Yeah, sure, sure. Mrs. Beuhler, would step over here, please? Your husband's promised he won't lay a hand on you. I'm sorry, Reba. I really mean it. Well, all right. Gee, honey, I must look a sight. Ah, no. Look what you did to my face. Well, you rotten, dirty bully. I told you, I'm sorry. What do you want from me? You want me to get down on my hands and knees? You handled that okay. Only took us 10 minutes to cool her down again. Yeah. Hey, lighten up on me, will you, partner. You still chewing on that murder? Yeah, I guess so. Look, Reed, I've had other assignments and I couldn't wait to get back into a car. I guess I'll have to move on someday. But I'm not lookin' forward to it. As far as I'm concerned, this is where it happens. Right here on the street. And we get it all. The beginning of it anyway. The blue Mercury. In the lower sevens. I got it. Nora Ocean lda-- No. They sure stiffened up when they saw us. I'll pull around 'em and see what they do. Front plates, Lincoln Union Ocean. They're going. Am I clear? Go. [siren wailing] (female dispatcher) All units and all frequencies stand by. 1-Adam-12 is in pursuit. [tires screeching] He's in a dead end. (Malloy) Drop 'em. You're not going anywhere. Come on, buddy. You've got trouble enough. Toss 'em down. Over against the wall. Let's go. Both of you. Hands against the wall and lean on 'em. Feet back. Spread em'. Put your left hand behind your head. Left hand behind your head. Hype kit. Smack. Six balloons. $50, $60 worth. Looks like we got a couple of real nice guys here. Yeah. I don't believe we'll have to turn this case over to anybody. No, hardly. Of course, it's not what you'd call really interesting. It'll do. Hey, Jerry, how're you doing with that murder? I tell you, we ran ourselves ragged ever since you left. We haven't eaten dinner yet. Victim was Walsh, all right. But we just got a call. About an hour ago, evidently, his brother-in-law sobered up and had a fit of conscience or something. He walked into Newton Station and copped out on the whole thing. Could've saved ourselves the trouble. Looks like you've had some business. A couple of boys been on the run about a month. Parole violators. They got tails hanging on 'em in Santa Barbara. About six warrants apiece. 211s mostly. Too bad you guys got tied up. Yeah, well... Oh, I meant to tell you, you fellows did a real good job protecting the scene before we got there. Any time, Sergeant. That's our job.
