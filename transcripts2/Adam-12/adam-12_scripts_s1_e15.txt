 Division's havin' the party next week. I know that. We've always had good entertainment. (Russo) And you're the entertainment chairman. (Reed) Look I've been trying. Well, what's the problem? Everybody I've tried has turned me down. What about the fellow we had two years ago? The motor officer. Johnny Fredericks? Yeah, he was great. My wife still talks about him. There you go, get him. I tried. He's out of town. I still haven't tried these people down at the bottom.

 I'm pretty sure I can get one of them. I don't recognize this name. Oh, he works latent prints. I hear he's a very good comedian. For an amateur, I mean. Yeah, I've seen his act. Yeah? Nothing. The point is, I think I can get him. What for, if he's not funny? A comic's supposed to be funny. I don't think we ought to even try him. Okay, let's take him off the list. And this gal here, uh, what does she do? She's studying singing, operatic, I think. Just what we need. Glad we looked at the list. She was just a thought. (Russo) And I've seen this Marty Claxton. (Malloy) We better get up to roll call. Yeah. He's okay for a stag dinner or something. I hear he's pretty funny. Yeah, but not for kids. And there's bound to be a lot of them there. Believe me, he's not right for this party at all. They just shot down my whole list. Entertainment. Why did I ever volunteer for this thing? I told you not to do it. Malloy, you don't understand. If nobody volunteered for things like this, then nothing would ever get done. I don't know. Maybe you make sense to you. Suppose you could get Randy Tait. The folk singer? (Malloy) Hmm. You gotta be puttin' me on. Sure, a big star like that. That's his name there on the subpoena. Yeah, Randolph Tait. You give it to him, you can ask him. Malloy, see that gal over there? The one with the little girl? Yeah. I thought she might be lost or something. She's going to the bus stop. Anyway, what would I say to him? "Here's a subpoena, Mr. Tait. And, oh, by the way, would you do me a favor?" Ah, you know what he'd do? No, I don't know. I know what he'd do. Tell me to take a fast jump at myself. There's no harm in tryin'. I'll wind up lookin' like a fool. Hey, there's Teejay. [car horn honking] Man, you guys are somethin' else. I just got back to town last night and here you are. Where've you been? Over to San Berdoo. Visit my brother. (Reed) What about your job? I quit. What happened? Man, I've been pushin' those lettuce crates around that storage dock for six months. I mean, that's a lot of work. So I quit. (Reed) Just like that. You know how it is. I gotta look ahead, think of the future. Well, what're you gonna do now? I don't know, somethin'. (Malloy) Where're they dealing smack in town? Come on, Malloy, I just got back to town and-- I know, and you knew what was happenin' on the street before you hit the sack. Well, I, I do hear a thing or two every time to time. They say they're dealin' up at 23rd and Victoria. (Malloy) Who? Jimmy Eisely. Out of that vacant lot up there? No man, he's got a pad. Where's his stash? In the pad, I guess. What's the address? I don't know. But the word is it takes two knocks to get in. One, then a little wait and then another. Okay. Thanks, Teejay. Hey, listen, if--if you guys should hear of a job around, would you let a fellow know? Yeah, we will. Not just, not just anythin', now, you know. 'Cause I gotta look to the future. What-what I need is a career. It would help. Sounds a little vague to me. He's put us onto a couple of things before. Have you talked to the dicks? Yeah, just now. Who'd you talk to? Sergeant Smitson. He said it sounded a little vague to him, too. It's okay with him if we want to go ahead and move on it. I can see his point. He's shorthanded enough this week. If you like the information run it down, when you can find the time. We'd like to prowl through the area as soon as it gets dark. All right, and just in case you turn anything, contact Sgt. MacDonald in L-20. And I'll try and give you another unit or two. What time? Say 8:00. Okay, but remember: handle any regular customers first. What I think I'd better do is ask some of the fellows first. About what? Randy T a?. Don't. Well, some of them might not like him. Some of them probably wouldn't like Mickey Mouse. You can't please 'em all. Unless you're lookin' for an excuse not to ask him. No, just 'cause he's a big star and all, doesn't bother me. Okay then. He's just like anybody else. That's right. Besides, maybe he won't be home. Isn't that the same gal? Yeah, still at the bus stop. Is everything all right, ma'am? We noticed you here about an hour ago and we were wonderin'... Just a minute, please. Are you lost? Is that it? [sobbing] All right, get a hold of yourself. I mean, there's nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Can we have your name, ma'am? Take it easy. Everything's gonna be fine. Do you have some kind of identification? [sobbing] You're Ellen Harris? How long have you been in from New Mexico, Mrs. Harris? Since yesterday. Do you know anybody here in town? My husband. What's his name? Bob. Robert. (Malloy) Would you know how to get a hold of him? He--he's stayin' with his Uncle Fred. Is his uncle's name Harris, too? Any middle name? L--l don't know. Elizabeth here hasn't had anything to eat since this morning. We'll see you get something to eat, Elizabeth. (Malloy) We sure will. You don't have any money, do you? And no address for your husband's uncle? L--l was trying to look him up in the phone book. But you have so many books. And a lot of Harrises. How long has it been since you ate? Yesterday. But she's the one I'm concerned about. [sobbing] Here. If you had these, why didn't you feed her? Because they're not mine. I stole them. Where from? That market down the street. L--l never took anything before, never. That's the truth. It'll be all right. Don't you worry. What're we gonna do? I don't know exactly. We just can't leave her there. No. Let me make a couple of calls. What does your husband do, Mrs. Harris? Sheet metal. He came to get a job with one of those aircraft companies about two weeks ago. What about his uncle? He's some kind of painter. She's a pretty little girl. Poor thing's all tired out from crying. Do we have to wait much more? Well, just until my partner gets back. He's gone to find out where he can take you. Oh, Elizabeth. I guess she does make a problem for you. Not too much. It's a fearsome town. It can be. Well, there now, that's more like it. You get in the car, Mrs. Harris. We'll drop you off at the Salvation Army. Where? The Salvation Army. (Reed) Hey, hey, hey, now. What's the matter? I thought I was going to jail. Oh, don't worry about the cookies. We'll explain that to the manager. We know him. I never even opened it. He can see that for himself. I kept thinking I could wait a bit for something to happen before I had to do that. You tell him that, please. We will. You sure now. How long did that guy at the Salvation Army say they'd keep her? Till she gets squared away. They're gonna call the unions tomorrow. They should be able to find her husband or the uncle. There's the street, 23rd. The pad must be around here someplace. Let's start with the alley. [crickets chirping] N'[rock music playing] (Malloy) Okay, we got it. Get the car out of here and put us Code 6. N'[music continues playing] [engine starting] [door opening] Hold it. Police. Hey, hey. (Malloy) Quiet Okay, let's go. Left hand on the back of the head. How many people still inside? Come on. Four. What's your name? Bob Wills. 1-Adam-12 request 1-L-20 meet me on Tac-2. (female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12, roger. Get in. 1-Adam-12 to L-20. (Sergeant) L-20, go. Sergeant, we just picked up a narco suspect in the alley behind 2357 Victoria. There are four others inside. They're gonna miss him pretty soon. If we're gonna take this place, we've better move. I'm on the way, Malloy. Ordering some back-up. Turn your prisoner over to the first unit shows up. KMA. 1-Adam-12, roger. Looks like we're in business. N'[music playing] [knock on door] Hold it right there. Let's have it. [radio clicks off] [sighing] Put your hands behind your head. What's your name? Jim. Uh, Jim Ralston. I'm gonna give you your rights. "You have the right to remain silent. "If you give up the right to remain silent, anything you say "can and will be used against you in a court of law. "You have the right to speak with an attorney "and to have an attorney present during questioning. "If you desire an attorney and cannot afford one, one will be appointed for you without charge." You understand these rights as I've explained them to you? Yeah. You wanna give up the right to remain silent? Yeah, okay. You wanna give up the right to speak with an attorney and to have him present during questioning? Sure, sure. When did you shoot last? Oh, about 5:00, I guess. Right there, huh? Yeah, yeah, I guess. You were holdin' two dime bags. Where'd you get 'em? Around, out on the street. Don't give me that. You got 'em from a guy and the guy's got a name. Where's Jimmy keep his stash? Oh, man, I don't know nothin' about that. How long you've been here? A couple of hours. Bought three, four bags from him. No, no, uh-uh. Anybody else buy from him? No, uh-uh. How long have you known Jimmy? Um. Like, uh, about two weeks, uh, 10 days. L--l haven't counted. Close your eyes. Huh? Close your eyes. What it was is, um... You see, Jim's leavin' town, and I just came by to give him a hand. Help out, like the rest, you know. Mmm-hmm. Open 'em up. How much did you shoot? A full bag? Oh, no, man. I couldn't afford that. Half a bag, you know. I'll tell you one thing, friend. You shot a lot later than 5:00. Let's go. All right, you can start putting it back, Miss Parks. Okay, you just sit down there a while. I found these on him. James Ralston. I'll check all the stuff in here. Keep your own list. Okay. I questioned him some. Nothing? He claims he doesn't know where the stash is. My guess is nobody knows that but Jimmy. Figures. He's got a lot of dough tied up in it. Have you talked to him? No, go ahead. I gave him his rights. Okay, Jimmy, let's go inside. [sighing] [door closing] My partner says he gave you your rights. Yeah, yeah, he did. You wanna waive 'em? Sure, why not? Goin' someplace? Goin' down to the Springs for a few days. It's nice down there. (Eisely) Yeah, real great. How long you've been dealin' out of this pad? [chuckling] Come on. You sold Ralston three or four bags. He tell you that? We took two off him. And he'd shot at least one. Nobody's been shootin' here. Come on, man. We picked up Bob Wills outside. He had a sack full of cotton balls. One of 'em was wet. Had blood on it. Now--now, there you are. You get a few people in the place, you just can't keep track of 'em all. You've known Ralston long? Oh, a few months, that's it. He says two weeks. Well. [door opening] Thought you might be interested in this. (Malloy) Cutting equipment. What're you doing with all these balloons? Well, I, uh, I just have 'em, you know. You can find stuff like that in a lot of houses. Not in the back of the TV set, you don't. You searchin' the place? Uh-huh. No fresh marks. I haven't shot in four years. Yeah, you're a regular boy scout, aren't you? Your hand's cold. You nervous? Sure I'm nervous. Pad full of cops gonna tear the place apart... We don't have to. Just tell us where it is. Man, I have not been dealin'! That'll be the day. Okay, come on. [sighing] You and Reed might as well start in here. You wanna take that side? Mmm-mmm. Well, we're about finished in here. All we got is one lousy bust on possession. And not much else. You know, I've been watching Jimmy. I don't think he's looked toward the bedroom once. You check everything? Yeah. We can take another look. Yeah. I got it. It was hangin' in the drain. You can look at the bedroom now, Jimmy. You know how much that stuff cost me? Try the bright side. At least you saved the price of a trip to Palm Springs. Come on, let's go. What do you say? Shall we go try and give Mr. Tait his subpoena? [clicking tongue] I guess we'd better. What's eating you? What I think I'd better do is write Randy Tait a letter. (Malloy) Reed. I got his address. Don't make a big deal out of it. I could, uh, say something like "I'm the officer that met you the other night." You know, and not mention the subpoena. A letter takes too long. Just go and ask him. He won't bite you. I guess not. And if he does, you can always book him for battery. You don't have to come along. I can handle it. No, I'll serve him the subpoena. Then if he's gonna get upset, I'll be the heavy. And you can ask him about the party. (Malloy) Well, you were gonna ask him? Well, I was thinkin' about just coming back and tellin' you he turned me down. Well, come on. Let's get it over with. (Malloy) Go ahead, lay it on 'em. Well, I got you a guy for the party. Who? Randy T a?. You're kidding. No. Holy smoke! How'd you get him? Oh, we had to serve him with a subpoena. He has to testify in a tax case, some record company or other. (Reed) So, I ask him. He's more than happy to come. He's great. Hey, how much is it gonna cost us? Oh, he wanted to do it for free, but I told him we had to pay him somethin', so... So? Well, he said he'd only take union scale. That's $50. We've never had a star that big before. Nobody's ever had a star that big. It's sure too bad. (Reed) What's the matter? Well, that you waited till the last minute like this. I mean, you should've buttoned him up sooner, Reed. We could've raised the price of the tickets. You just can't win, partner.
