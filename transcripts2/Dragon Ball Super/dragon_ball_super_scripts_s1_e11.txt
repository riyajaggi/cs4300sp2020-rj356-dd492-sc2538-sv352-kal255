Let's go! Go! Make a big panic! Let's Go! Go! dai panic! Losing will just make you stronger makeru to tsuyoku naru Being called foolhardy just means... minohodo shirazu ni wa Regrets and limits won't ever stop you! kokai to ka genkai to ka nai mon Superb, sublime, dynamic! sozetsu chozetsu dynamic! Let's go! Yes! Show me your kicks! Let's Go! Yes! renda kick Make us shake with excitement! abisete mushaburui You've got a super tale to tell! sugee koto ga matte'run da ze Goku transformed into a Super Saiyan God however.. Controlling his new power wasn't easy. I almost got bored waiting. What! First, a flick to the forehead! Then comes a chop to the back of your neck. Dammit! Ouch! That was harder then i thought. But now we are even. You're a lot like me you know. Now it starts for real.. The battle of the gods. Just how it should be. I haven't used my full power yet. Now that Beerus is fighting seriously, does Goku stand a chance. Let's Keep Going Beerus! The Battle of Gods Continues! Bulma, is this the fastest we can go? The crash from earlier damaged the engines. Can you hurry up please? If you're in such a hurry, why don't you just fly? We want to fly but.. you see.. We are all out of energy. Out of energy? At such an important time! It must be because they performed the Super Saiyan God ritual. In any case it's not a battle any of us can be apart of anyway. We are counting on you, Goku! Whenever you are ready, Super Saiyan God. Alright... Here I come! That didn't even scratch him. ahhh, It seems provoking you is no longer working. Beerus attacks are so strong. This is just for you... This one is a lot bigger than the last one. This is especially for you. What will you do now? Is it too much for you? Can't you guys just find lock onto their energy... We cannot sense the power of Gods. What do you mean? Brother! I see something! That's... Woah.. It looks amazing. There's no time to admire it! Lets go quickly! There he is! It's Father! Where? He's Amazing! Yeah, That's Dad for you! It's incredible. He's on par with the God of Destruction. On par? No! He might even be stronger! That's not fair Beerus Huh? You're still not using your full power. Oh you noticed. Ah well.. sorry sorry. It's just that I need a little more encouragement from you. ..and then maybe I can take this more seriously. Elder... Is Beerus purposely holding back... and pretending to be getting hit by Goku? Seems so. Why is he doing that? To help Goku control his new Super Saiyan God power. ..and then fight him at full strength. But what's the purpose of doing that?! Hmm. To have some fun probably. Beerus is very scary when he gets serious. I understand your reason though. When someone is as strong as you Lord Beerus, There's not many people you can fight against using your full power. And about that... The talking ends here. You have no idea... What's wrong, Super Saiyan God?! Even after coming this far has nothing changed for you! Father! Timed by Ken Xyro. Come join us @ www.animerg.la Come join us @ www.animerg.la Bulma, we have to hurry! -I know that! The engine is still having problems... Against the power of God of Destruction, even the increased power of a Super Saiyan God.. Is no match at all... Smart of you to escape just before the explosion... Super Saiyan God. You're making me sleepy! Sleepy! Sleepy! Sleepy! Sleepy! Sleepy! Sleepy! Sleepy! Sleepy! Sleepy! I can't stand it anymore! Darn you! That was a nice one... But a blow like that.. against someone like me.. ..is not enough to even wake me from my sleep! -It's that island, hurry! I know that! Stop giving me orders! Huh... What's that? -Goku?! -Father?! They are going up! Follow them. -I know that already! How long are you gonna sleep... Shall I start this time... Well I don't like saying this but.. I wonder if it's time I destroy the planet. Maybe this will bring put a charge in your efforts... No... No way! Stop it! It's your own fault. How could you take human lives so lightly?! This is a battle between two Gods. Which is more important, human life or a fight among gods...? That's a stupid question. Someone like you can't repel this attack. If I can't throw it back... then I have to just destroy it! That's a good idea. How about this? Feeling motivated now? I'll show you the true power of a Super Saiyan God! That's good... Yes yes! This feeling.. Keep going! Lets go! KA- MEH- HA- MEH- HA!!!! Too bad.. It seems the the person in my dreams... The one I am looking for, isn't you after all... Dad! You're way too strong.. Beerus. What the heck. I didn't know.. that someone... that someone so strong, could exist. Strong... Stronger... Too strong... Way too strong... Somehow I... Somehow... Somehow... Somehow... I... Somehow, I... Awesome! I'm getting all fired up! What? What was that?! Shall we continue, Beerus? The full power of a Super Saiyan God.. is much, much more than what I had imagined it to be! I like the look on your face. Out of respect for you coming back... I'll show you.. my full power! What was that? The power of a Super Saiyan God... has still not reached it's potential. Goku will now fight at full strength. Who is going to win this fight?! Hi! It's me Goku! The true power of the Super Saiyan God is.. Really incredible! Huh? Is that the voice of the kai's?! Hey? Stop the fight immediately?! Are you nuts? I'm going to fight and win! Next time on Dragon Ball Super! "The Universe Crumbles?! Clash! The God of Destruction vs Super Saiyan God!" Don't miss it! I see little kids hurrying off Colourful backpacks on their backs If I was a kid like them... What color would I choose? Where would I be heading? Hello, hello hello...? What do you think of the man I've become? Hello, hello hello...? Can you be proud of the man you'll become? As you grow, you may slip up at times But you'll come out on top, just wait and see This is my song for the younger me Come join us @ www.animerg.la
