   Don't you wanna dream again? Now it's calling for me go back to the start Wishing on the starlight In the sky, let's paint a door for tomorrow Just step on the new stage don't be shy Gonna take the challenge of God Kyo-Let's☆Mo-Let's☆Dynamic! Let's! Go! Go! Big panic I don't care 'bout limits, no regret Make me tougher even though I lose Nothing gonna stop me no mo' try me So-Zets☆Cho-Zets☆Dynamic! Let's Go! Yes! Give a kick! Keep on going power pumpin' up something greater waiting not so far away [NARRATOR] Previously, on Dragon Ball Super, a fearsome deity, known as Lord Beerus, awoke after a nap of thirty-nine years. He had dreamt of a warrior who could rival him in battle, and his Oracle Fish confirmed the rival's name: a Super Saiyan God. With the help of his servant Whis, Beerus has learned about Goku, and hopes the powerful Saiyan can help him find the so-called Saiyan God. Meanwhile, Bulma's birthday party has kicked off on Earth, with none of her guests knowing anything about the peril looming in the stars above. [KING KAI gasps] [NARRATOR] Goku and Beerus meet at last. Now! Aaaah... [BUBBLES] Ooh. [GREGORY] Aaah. Wow, so that's Beerus the Destroyer, huh? He definitely looks strong. But it's weird, I can't sense any energy. Without my eyes, I wouldn't even know he was here! Ah man, this is so cool. I'm really excited! Keep your voice down, Goku! You're not supposed to let him find you! Oh, Lord Beerus, what a pleasant surprise. Welcome to my humble abode. I appreciate you coming all this way to see me. Uh, you look well. It's been quite a long time, hasn't it, North Kai? What? That's Beerus? [GREGORY] Get down! How many years has it been, exactly? Oh, uh, let's see here. One, two, three-four, five, six, seven, uh-- Three hundred twenty-seven Universal Standard years. Oh! I was counting to the exact month and day, Lord, but if you're fine with rounding, yeah, 327. I knew that like a minute ago. I'm sure. King Kai looks so nervous; he's shaking like a leaf. It's like he's terrified of the guy. Is Beerus really all that strong? If ignorance is bliss, then you've got it made. You know, I'd forgotten just how tiny this planet is now. [KING KAI] Well, I like to call it cozy--and easy to clean-- but--but of course you're right, lord. Please excuse the cramped accommodations. But I definitely want to make you comfy. Can I offer you something to eat or drink? Perhaps. Is it something good? [KING KAI] Oh, absolutely! Nothin' but the most delicious for us deities, right? [GOKU] Something delicious? Where's he's been hiding it? If I'd known that then I would've eaten it already. Intriguing. Though you'd better hope you're not overselling it, North Kai. Or this time I'll make your world even smaller. Maybe the size of that shed. Eeeh! Bubbles, what are you waiting for? Bring him a plate! The good stuff! On the top shelf, next to the brownies I made! But on second thought, I'll decline. I did just stuff myself on the way here. Oh, right! I haven't had mine! Hm. Oh, okay, no problem. Maybe just a snack then? I've got some crackers shaped like planets! [chuckles] I just told you I don't want anything, Kai. Don't make me say it again. Or I will destroy what's left of this world. Ah! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Please forgive me! I thought everyone liked crackers! You can save them for another time. [KING KAI] Oh yeah, great idea! So I have to ask. If you didn't come for the culinary tourism, Lord Beerus, then what is the reason for your visit? Well. There's a small matter I'd like to discuss with that Saiyan you're harboring. [KING KAI] Nnngh-hnnn! Aah! Busted! I told you this would happen. [KING KAI] Oh, where are my manners? I--I should have introduced you to him. Goku! Were you raised in a mountain hut? Stop being rude and come say hello to Lord Beerus! Now he wants me to come out? Can you please just pretend that you're polite? Yeah, yeah. Of course. [chuckles] Hey, my name is Goku! [groans] I had a feeling you were going to say that! You're old enough to know how to offer a proper greeting and show some respect! Start over! Ow, that hurt! Right, sorry. Hello and good morning, Your Greats. I'm Go--I mean. My name is Goku, sir! And it is an honor for you to meet me! Sir! Okay, if you say so. Now that that's out of the way, there's something I was hoping to ask you about-- Let's see, uh... Super... Super Saiyan God, my lord. Shall I write it down? Yes, yes, I knew that. So what can you tell me about the existence of this Super Saiyan God? Super Saiyan God, let me think. I mean I know all about regular Super Saiyan, sure. But that's a "no" on the God stuff, buddy. [grunts] Ah! I know not of it, sir! [KING KAI] I can't say I've heard of it either, Lord Beerus. It sounds like a dead end you probably shouldn't worry about anymore. [chuckles] Well that's too bad. But my servant Whis, here, tells me you defeated that bastard Frieza in battle. Uh. Oh yeah, I kicked his butt a long time ago! I mean-- Yes, lord. [BEERUS] Mm. Mm? Mmm mm-mmm. No. It doesn't seem possible that you could defeat him as you are now. But I understand you're capable of transformation. Becoming a "Super Saiyan," as you call it? Yes, that's right. It's an interesting power-up, though not that interesting. For someone of your caliber, it'd be more like a trick you do at parties. [BEERUS] Then not a Super Saiyan God. See, my lord, it's as I suspected. This wasn't a true premonition, it was just a dream; the random thoughts of a sleeping mind. That makes a lot more sense than a mysterious warrior no one's heard of who's somehow capable of matching your power. [BEERUS] Hmmm. Possibly. Except I'm not the only one who dreamed it. The Oracle Fish saw it as well. Let's ask Prince Vegeta what he knows. Planet Earth should be relatively close to here, right? [KING KAI] Planet Earth? Are you sure you're up for more traveling? It takes at least three minutes to get there. Just three minutes? Why would I care about that? It sounds like you don't want me to go, Whis. Is this going to be an issue? Hm. Not at all, my lord. We'll go wherever you like. Uh, about that. You're not planning to destroy the earth or anything are you? Not so long as nothing there annoys me. [BEERUS] Come on, Whis. Let's go. As you wish, Lord Beerus. Hey listen, you're supposed to-- Sorry. I mean, Lord Beerus sir, I have heard that your lordship is incredibly strong. How 'bout showing me a teensy bit of your strength so I can know if that's true? Goku! How could he ask that? So you want me to demonstrate my power? In what way? Nothing big. We could go toe to toe in a sparring match, even if only for a minute! That's enough out of you. Let the adults talk. I'm sorry, Lord Beerus, I'm still civilizing him. He's sort of like a puppy you to try to housetrain but he keeps soiling all the carpets, and the walls, and the furniture, and the ceiling, and... I've lived hundreds of millions of years. Yet never in my existence have I been issued a challenge such as yours, Goku. You must be strong indeed to have that degree of confidence. Either that, or you're just an arrogant fool. Yes, that's it. He's a fool! He's a big, dumb, stupid fool. Just look at him! [BEERUS] Why not. Go ahead and come at me with all you've got. [KING KAI] What? Oh sweet! Uh! I mean, thank you very much, Your Lordness. Why don't you get how stupid this is? He's not a fighter in a tournament! Or even some alien trying to conquer a galaxy. Beerus is a Destroyer deity, okay! He's on a whole other level, other than anyone you've seen before! He's got enough power in one breath to knock you to the other end of the universe! You're the dust in his nostril when he blows his nose! All the more reason to fight him; to see where I need to improve! Aw man, this is gonna be great! [KING KAI] I swear you have brain damage! I'm bored. Are we doing this or not? [GOKU] Yeah, yeah. We're doing it, we're doing it! Very well. Whenever you're ready then. Well I could try fighting you in my normal state, but that might be an insult to your power, Your Destroyerness. [grunts] [BEERUS] Huh. This level is called a Super Saiyan. Interesting. So you relied on this to combat Frieza. And you do seem to have powered up a little bit. As I said, attack when you like. Uh. I can't believe this is happening. Would you like to share some of this lunch while we wait? Let's get one thing clear. I don't want you holding anything back in this battle 'cause I'm giving you all I've got. Yes, please do. [yells] [WHIS sighs] [GOKU] Come on! He's evading Goku like it's nothing! [WHIS] Mm. It appears there won't be enough time for a proper lunch today. [GOKU yells] Damnit, I'm not even laying a finger on this guy. Yeah, I told you, dummy! Now stop while you still can! [yawns] Goku! [bellows] [wails] [panting] You're a decent fighter aren't you, Saiyan? Now I see how you could defeat Frieza after reaching this level. But even with this increase you're only slightly stronger than he was. I bet you barely scraped by. Ha! You don't mince words, do you? But I'm a lot tougher than you think! I was expecting a good deal more from you. What a disappointing trip. You ready to go, Whis? [WHIS] Always, my lord. No wait! This fight isn't even close to finished! [BEERUS] Hmm? [GOKU] Get a load of this! It's called Super Saiyan Two! Hey, can you please stop now while we still exist? Please! Oh? You found another level? Seems you're more clever than I thought. Maybe this has something to do with the Super Saiyan God and it's not a wasted trip after all. Super Saiyan Two, how fascinating. Hmm. No, I still don't think there's time. When I'm this level you won't get off so easily. [yells] [BEERUS] Oh. So that's all he has to offer. [KING KAI cries out nervously] Aw, not this wall, too! Time out! --[BEERUS] Hm? --[WHIS] Huh. Look, Lord Beerus. You're clearly great at dodging, but could you fight back a little, too? I mean how can I appreciate how strong you really are if all you do is get out of the way? Shut up! Very well. [KING KAI gasps] But only if you can show me you have enough power to make even my slightest effort worthwhile. --Oh yeah? --Yeah. All right, if it's proof you want... ...then proof you'll get! [GOKU] Damn it, there's no point. His guard's completely up! Gotta change that! [yells] No one can blame me for what happens now. Aw, come on! Even after powering up to Super Saiyan Two I can't land a single blow. You're amazing, Lord Beerus. On a whole other level. [KING KAI] I literally said that! [bellows] [panting] Are you finished yet? I won't fight back if this is the best that you can do. [GOKU] Uh? Of course, you haven't fooled me. I can sense there's still more your body is capable of. So stop holding it back. Show me your all if you want any hope of witnessing a Destroyer's power. Well when you put it like that I guess I don't have any other choice. Just remember you asked for it! Goku! [GOKU bellows] [continues] [KING KAI exhales quaveringly] [bellows] [GOKU] This is it, Beerus. This is Super Saiyan Three! [KING KAI] Aah! Run for cover! [ALL yell] [KING KAI yelps] Bubbles, help. Aah. Super Saiyan Three. Seems you've been working hard over the years. Compared to your previous forms, the increase in power is indeed considerable. Perhaps you're not the total imbecile I took you for. This third level really does seem to be different. Guess I am eating, then. All right, Beerus, you see my real power. So does that means you're gonna start fighting back now? Well. How can I know it's enough until I've seen you put it into action? Say what? [BEERUS] Hmmm. I can only use this power for so long, so let's make it count! [bellows] [GOKU yells] Goku's power is awesome, but why does he have to pick this guy of all people? Mmm. Mmm! This cluck-bird is exquisite. I have outdone myself! [BEERUS chuckles] [ALL yell] I can't tell. Is Goku somehow winning? [bellows] Huh? Did that work? [gasps] [ALL yell] [WHIS] Mmm! He deflected the whole blast! He's amazing! [yells] What in the--? It's like my feet just moved on their own! Rather impressive, Saiyan. The truth is that you finally convinced me to attack you, which I was about to do in that moment. If you hadn't jumped back like that this fight would be over. Your instinct saved you. You can't sense my energy yet your body avoided me, even if your mind's still catching up. You truly are a gifted warrior, one of the best I've seen. But I don't suppose there's something you're keeping from me? Like a level that could actually challenge my power? Like Super Saiyan God, is that it? Well, now you're just mocking me. [bellows] He's dodging again! [GOKU] I thought he couldn't after I went Super Saiyan Three. Unless he was taking my earlier attacks on purpose, just to show he could. [bellows] [ALL yell] [gasps] Well, I guess that's all. And while this is a letdown, you did give me an entertaining show. So I'll thank you by showing you something, too. A very small display... of a Destroyer's power. [BEERUS chuckles] [groans] Aah! Goku! Goku! You okay? All right, Whis, let's go. Yes, sir. Excuse me, monkey? Would you mind washing this for me please? [BUBBLES chatters] Why thank you. Till we meet again, North Kai. [KING KAI] Uh, all right! Bye! [ALL] Whoa! [GOKU groans] [KING KAI] Oh, so you're still breathing. Good. You're just lucky that Lord Beerus was in a good enough mood to hold back his actual power. [sighs] But now we've got a bigger problem. [fog horn blares] [gasps] Oh, so you did show up! You act all tough, but I know at the end of the day you just can't stand the thought of your lovely wife being sad. [VEGETA] Hmph! [BULMA] Come on, the rest of the gang is here, too. Let's go over and make a big entrance together! Yeah, sure. Let's go see Yamcha! Oh I see. You can't even pretend to be happy? [VEGETA] Of course not. Okay fine! Suit yourself! [VEGETA] Hm! [BULMA] You Saiyans are such a pain! I hope you get a sunburn! [KING KAI] Vegeta, this is King Kai. Can you hear me? King Kai? What could you possibly want from me ? Yeah. Drop the attitude for a few seconds, I'm trying to help you here. There's a being called Beerus The Destroyer. And he's headed to Earth as we speak. [VEGETA] Beerus the Destroyer? I think I've heard that name before. [KING KAI] Well good for you. I'm sure you're very worldly and cultured. Now he's awake and looking for a challenge, so do not engage him in any way. That means no insulting, no fighting, no Vegeta-ing of any kind. Otherwise, if someone or something sets him off, it'll mean the complete destruction of Earth! You really think he'd blow up the earth? And just in case you have delusions of grandeur and think you could fight him, well, don't! He already beat Goku in two blows! Are you serious! He defeated Kakarot that easily? [KING KAI] Yes! That easily. [GOKU groans] [KING KAI] Oh, look who's conscious! Wow. He really is awesome. I can't believe he's that strong! Even though we told you, like, repeatedly? [KING KAI] You should thank your lucky stars he didn't kill you, not to mention destroy this whole quadrant, you ignoramus. Now what do I do? The only way I could boost my strength quickly would be to maybe fuse with Vegeta again, right? But I don't even think that would do the trick. [KING KAI] What are you talking about? Are you actually still thinking about fighting him? But what was that Super Saiyan God stuff he kept talking about? Is that a level I could reach if I train hard enough? Or is it the name of one Saiyan that we didn't even know existed? Wow. You are beyond help. But King Kai... We have to warn Earth! He's headed there now! I already took care of it. I told Vegeta. He's the one I'd bet on to stir up the most trouble, not counting you. Vegeta and Beerus. Yeah you're right, that could get ugly pretty fast. I need to get down there, too. [GREGORY] Stay down, you're hurt! I can't sit here while the earth's in danger! I have to find a way to stand up to this guy! Aah! Goku. I see all these kids as I walk to school Their colorful bag, that's so unique and cool I can't help but wonder which color I'd choose If I still were a kid, Where would I run off to? Hello, Hello, Hello– How am I looking now that I've grown into an adult? Hello, Hello, Hello– Do I look like I'm proud of who I've finally become? If I know I've made mistakes but I'm trying to get it right, And I'm willing just to wait for the moment I can shine This anthem is the story of all time [GOKU] Hey! It's me, Goku! And this is strange. Beerus is crashing Bulma's birthday, and it kinda seems like she likes it! But everybody's gotta be careful! They don't realize how dangerous he is! Vegeta, we're counting on you now! No pressure or anything, but keeping the earth from getting destroyed is totally up to you. Next time, on Dragon Ball Super: Come on, King Kai. Are you sure I shouldn't go down there, too?
