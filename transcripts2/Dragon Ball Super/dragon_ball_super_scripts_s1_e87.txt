   ♪ Opening Theme Song plays... [♪♪] *DRAGON BALL SUPER (DUBBED)* Original one : Season 01 Episode 87 (Dubbed one TV release : S05 E11) ♪ Don't you know I'm unstoppable? ♪ ♪ Don't even try, 'cause you will fall ♪ ♪ I got a strength, deep in my soul, ♪ ♪ that gives me courage and control ♪ ♪ I'll go beyond the limit break ♪ ♪ The universe is mine to take ♪ ♪ I have no fear, I think it's clear ♪ ♪ Let's kick it up into high gear ♪ ♪ Oh this is Dragon Ball Super ♪ ♪ We've got the skills to blow Zeno away! ♪ [♪♪] [♪♪] [NARRATOR] Previously, on Dragon Ball Super, Goku, racing to assemble his team for the Tournament of Power, arrived on the island where Android 17 works as a park ranger at an animal preserve. [GOKU] You're Android 17, right? Well, aren't you informed... Seeing as we've never met. [NARRATOR] Goku was eager to see what 17 was capable of. [GOKU] I'm looking for strong allies. The strongest in the entire Universe! [A17 gasps] Fight me, 17! Let's see what you've got! [GOKU yells] [GOKU grunting] [yells] [groans] [GOKU yelling] Huh?! [NARRATOR] Impressed by 17's abilities, Goku asked him to compete in the Tournament of Power. [GOKU] If we lose the tournament, our universe will be destroyed. I assume you don't want that. Fight with us and at least we've got a chance! The guys on the other universes' teams are all super strong! [A17] If we're doomed, so be it. [GOKU] Uh! [A17] Obliteration for all. Not just the helpless. That's a fate I can accept. [NARRATOR] 17 turned down the invitation. It's up to Goku to win him over, now! [♪♪] [NARRATOR] "Hunt the Poaching Ring! Goku and Android 17's Joint Struggle!" Title: "Hunt the Poaching Ring! Goku and Android 17's Joint Struggle!" Hey, you just can't let this happen, 17! Wow, you really are annoying, aren't you? [GOKU] What if I told you the winner'll be given Dragon Balls? And we're not talking normal Dragon Balls here, these are mega-sized ones, way bigger than the kind we got on Earth. You know what that means, don't you? It means the sort of wishes they can grant are way bigger, too. Such things really exist? [GOKU] Yup, they sure do! And they're called Super Dragon Balls. "Super Dragon Balls," huh? [GOKU] You gotta see 'em. Each Ball is as big as a whole planet. [A17] That is incredible. Well? That's worth fighting for, right? I can't believe you're dangling the prize to try and bait me. [GOKU] I've gotta get you on our team, whatever it takes. I'm beggin' you! [A17] Super Dragon Balls? I'll admit, I'm intrigued. [roars] [A17 gasps] [GOKU gasps] [A17] Hold on. Someone's approaching the island. [GOKU] Yeah, I can sense their energy. And there's a whole lot of energies, at that. [GOKU] Uh! Whoa, what is that? It's clearly a spaceship. [GOKU] Uh... [gasps] [ANIMALS howling, wailing] [MINOTAUROS groans] These guys must be poachers! [GOKU] Really?! Space poachers?! They won't get away with it! What's your plan? Sneak in that opening. Are you comin' in with me? If you're goin', I'm goin'! All right, suit yourself. But just to be clear, I don't owe you anything for this. We're too late. Hey, quick, grab onto me! Hurry! Once they get into outer space, we'll lose 'em for good! [ANIMALS whimper] Whoa, what in the world is this place? [A17] It looks like they're going around to different planets, rounding up exotic animals. [GOKU] Man, what an awful thing to do. [alarm blares] Uh-oh, I think they know we're here. Let's try to wrap this up quickly. Yup, got it. [GOKU yells] Hey, don't blow a hole in the ship. If these animals get sucked out into the vacuum of space, they'll all die. Yeah. I'll be careful. That's odd. Goku's energy, it's moving away. I wonder if he's managed to track down 17 and get him on board yet. [thunder rumbles] [footsteps] Hey, what's the matter, sweetie? You look worried. [A18] Hm... I'm getting a bad feeling now. Uh? Goku and my brother. They're too similar. Uh! Really? You think? [A18] They're both a little on the immature side. I just hope they aren't getting each other into trouble. Did ya finish with yours yet? What does it look like, Goku? [GOKU] Uh! Sheesh, how many of you are there? All right, tough guy, these two are all yours. [GOKU] Uh?! I'm gonna go hunt down their boss and take him out. Hey, wait! No fair! He's gotta be, like, the strongest one! That's the guy I wanna fight, not these henchmen! [A17] If you won't do what I tell you to, then leave. You can't expect me to leave now! Let's rock-paper- scissors for it! Oh please quit acting like a child. [POACHER 87E] How 'bout I crush you both at once! [A17] Later. [GOKU] Not cool, dude! [POACHER 87F] Guess we scared your little friend. Now it's just us! I think I should warn you guys, I'm pretty good at this! [beeping] [laughing] [POACHER BOSS] At last... it's mine. At last, I've captured an elusive Minotaros! I have to get this beast home as soon as possible. [POACHER BOSS laughing] [A17] Hey, what's so funny? [POACHER BOSS] Uh? I asked you what was so funny to have you laughing hysterically. A park ranger, eh? [A17] And what if I am? You goody-two-shoes animal-huggers are all alike, getting in our way on every planet! You won't stop me! "Animal-hugger," huh? You say that like it's a bad thing. Don't you have anyone here to help you? Actually, I do have a temp with me today. But usually, I'm on my own. [POACHER BOSS] Ooh... That's quite brave. And it will spell your doom! [POACHER BOSS laughs] Well, you feeling nervous yet? Are you shaking in your boots, Ranger? 'Cause these guys are gonna slice you up and put you on skewers, then we're gonna barbecue and eat you. Right alongside all of your beloved furry friends! [POACHER BOSS laughs] Why do you think I work alone down there, protecting that whole island by myself? [gasps] Because I'm a one-man army. [POACHER BOSS growls] Destroy him! [POACHERS yell] [groans] [yelling] [POACHER 87G groans] [yelps] No, this is impossible! So now you're gonna take all the animals you've poached back to their home planets. If you do that, then I'll spare your life. [growls] Don't press your luck! [POACHER BOSS groans] Oh, there you are. Man, I've been looking for you everywhere. [POACHER BOSS groans] Filthy animal-hugger... [GOKU] So he's the boss, huh? [A17] Yeah. Oh, great, you're his helper, huh? Well, do your worst! Why do you want the Minotauros so badly? Isn't it obvious? For the money! Minotaros horns fetch a high price. Rumor has it you can make an immortality potion out of 'em, but nobody really knows if the stuff actually works. Not that it makes any difference to me, as long as I get paid. So how much is it going to cost to get you off my back? What's your price? C'mon, forget all that bleeding-heart crap for a second. No one cares that much about these creatures! Money's what makes the world go 'round! So, ten million? Huh? Twenty million?! Well this guy's some piece of work, isn't he? Uh?! 17? You must be joking? Twenty million's not enough? [POACHER BOSS groans] [POACHER BOSS coughs] Feelin' more sympathy for the animals now? [POACHER BOSS] Uh... You charlatans. Trying to project an air of virtue just to make yourselves feel better. Virtue? No, I don't pretend to have that. I just got tired of hearing you talk. Is that so? Then let me put you out of your misery! [A17 gasps] Hey, wait, what is that thing? You underestimated me, didn't you? I'm blowin' myself up, and takin' you with me! [A17, GOKU gasp] [POAS laughs] [POACHER BOSS] That's right, you're finished! The second I flip this switch, you and everything else on this ship will be blown to itsy-bitsy, teensy-weensy little pieces! Don't do this! I'm afraid it's too late. [POACHER BOSS laughs] Don't do it! [screams] Is something the matter, Lord Beerus? It was awful. I just had a dream that Goku died. [gasps] Oh, my! [cries] Oh, I'm sorry, Bulla. Did the mean cat-man scare you? How 'bout I put you to bed, huh? Ready to go night-night? [VEGETA growls] Damn that noisy god. If he's going to take a nap, can't he go somewhere else! We're not running the Capsule Hotel! Relax, it's most likely a reaction to all this stress, my lord. Yes, that's possible. Or it's an omen! A really bad omen! Oh, we're all doomed! [laughing] I have a highly powerful self-destruct device implanted inside my body. [gasps] [POACHER BOSS] Do you really want me to turn all of us, including your precious animals, into space debris? [POACHER BOSS laughs] Well, so what do we do now, 17? [POACHER BOSS] I call it my insurance. The second I flip this switch, the whole ship goes kaboom! You don't want that, do you? You don't want the cuddly little creatures you've been protecting all this time to be blown to smithereens... Not to mention yourselves, of course! Man, this guy's a rotten apple, all right, all the way through to the core! Let me go, and everyone walks away safe and sound! Well, boys? That's not a bad offer, now is it? Certainly better than letting all those cute furballs get fried. [laughs] So what will it be? Better make up your minds fast, 'cause my thumb is starting to get a little itchy! Forget the critters, you must at least care about yourselves! Animal preservation sounds nice, but self-preservation is what matters to you! [POACHER BOSS] Come on! Will you just admit it?! [A17] Okay, Goku. Huh? [A17] I'll let you take it from here. What, wait, what is that supposed to mean? [A17] Look after the animals for me. And please, give my regards to my wife and children. And 18, too. Uh! [A17] It's too bad. I would've liked to have another chat with you sometime. [grunts] [ALIEN POACHER gasps] [POACHER BOSS screams] Wait, don't do this! [POACHER BOSS screams] 17! [yelps] [GOKU grunting] [A17 gasps] [POACHER BOSS] Huh?! [POACHER BOSS groans] [KING KAI] Ah, Goku! And who might this be? Hi, King Kai, say hello to Android 17. [KING KAI] Oh, well, hello there. Pleased to make your acquaint... No, I mean who is this guy?! [GOKU] Oh, just some poacher who's trying to blow himself up. Blow up?! Did you say "blow up"?! [GREGORY, BUBBLES gasp] I figured I'd bring him here, like I did that time with Cell. [KING KAI] Despite what you seem to think, we are not the bomb squad! Ah, so this is where all of that went down, huh? Go away! Go away right this second! [GREGORY] Right this very second! All right, if you insist, we'll get outta here. Bye, guys. He's all yours now. No, you dunce! Don't leave him here! It's too dangerous! Take him with you! Oh, it'll be fine. He's so weak, he can't stand the gravity here. Literally, he can't stand up or even move. Besides, what's it matter to you if something's dangerous? I mean, you're already dead, what could possibly go wrong? What could possibly go wrong?! Are you crazy?! [GREGORY] Yeah, what he said! [DENDE] Goku! Uh! Whoa, hey, is that you, Dende? [DENDE] Indeed. That poacher says he has a self-destruct device inside his body, but he's lying. [GOKU] What? He's lying? It was probably all a ruse so you would let him get away. Huh, you don't say? You really know everything! Thanks for the heads up there! Way to be a great Guardian! [DENDE] Of course, anytime. Hey, dude, you weren't lyin' to us, were ya? Uh, no, not at all, I wasn't lying, I was just, uh... [A17] Hey. [screams] Why don't you go ahead and flip that switch to prove it. [POACHER BOSS] Well, um, I would, but I can't really move and all. Uh... Flip it. Now. [POACHER BOSS] Uh... Okay! [POACHER BOSS grunting] [GOKU] Uh. Uh... [ALL] Uh... What the...? After the poachin', I was supposed to go to a friend's surprise party. You know how it is. Well I'll be a giant monkey. Ah. Ridiculous. [GOKU laughs] [A17] Hmph. [roars] Goku, you were right to report this. So this guy's a friend of yours? Yup, this here's Jaco. "Taco"? [JACO] Do I look like a taco to you? Either way, I'm not gonna remember. He's a space cop, with the sharpest eyes in the galaxy! [A17] Oh. [JACO] Thanks to you two, I can bring in a ring of intergalactic poachers I've been chasing for years. They've been catching and selling endangered animals, not just from Earth, but from other planets, too. They move around so much, we've never been able to pin them down. Which means, after this bust, I could be looking at a big, fat promotion! So you're just gonna take all the credit for this then? [JACO] Of course I am! This is my jurisdiction, after all. Yeah, but all you did was show up after we'd already taken them down. Y'know, you could try fighting alongside us, for once. A Super-Elite is always super busy. [GOKU] Yeah, more like super lazy. [JACO] Plop. I'll see ya later, guys. And I'll be sure to send you a thank you note, although maybe I won't if that turns out to be easier for me. Yeah, I definitely won't be sending you one. [A17] All right, fine. I'm in. [GOKU] Hm? I'll join your team for the tournament. I don't like being in debt to anybody. I'll leave Trunks and Goten in charge of the island and just hope they're up to it. Wow, you mean it?! That's great! Y'know, I've given it some thought, and once we win, I think I'd like to use the Super Dragon Balls to wish for a boat. A boat, huh? Really. What do you want that for? [A17] Now, when I say boat, I'm talking about a giant cruise liner, the kind that costs billions of zeni. It's been my dream to travel around the world with my family someday. Oh, yeah? And what are you gonna wish for? Who, me? Really? [laughs] Oh, right, of course. Guess that's a frivolous question. You're only in this to save the world, right? No, see. I don't think of it like I'm saving the world. The fact is, it's 'cause I'm usually trying to challenge the strongest warriors I can find. That's how this tournament happened, too. But I can't bear the thought of innocent lives getting wiped out just 'cause I wanna fight the best. So I'll do what I can for them. [A17] You are a fascinating man, Goku. [GOKU] I am? Well, if so, it's all thanks to the Old Man's teachings. [A17] Still, for someone like me, who was engineered to kill you, to now end up on your team, it's an odd twist of fate. It's not that odd, though. Tien, Piccolo, Vegeta, they all started out as my enemies, too. So, is my brother gonna be on the team with us, as well? Hold on, you have a brother? You know, mister mini monk. I mean, Krillin. Oh. Right, Number 18's your twin sister, and Krillin's her husband. That makes him your brother-in-law, right? Believe it or not, I'd never thought of that before! I believe. [GOKU 'Course Krillin's on the team! You should see him. He's all bulked up now. And then there's Buu. Wait, Buu? Who you fought with the Spirit Bomb? That Buu? That's him. But don't worry about it. He's changed since then. He's a good guy now. [A17] This is gonna be one hell of a team. [GOKU] Looks like you'll have a bunch of folks cheering for you back home, huh. We're gonna have to win this thing, no matter what it takes! That's right. [NARRATOR] At last, Android 17 has agreed to join the rest of the fighters on the Seventh Universe team. But can Goku and the others emerge victorious from the battle royale? The fate of the earth depends on it. Only 23 hours and 20 minutes remain until the Tournament of Power begins. The race to build a team continues.
