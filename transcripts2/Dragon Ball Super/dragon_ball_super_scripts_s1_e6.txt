Just do whatever you want! {\blur1}Vegeta awaits him there. Will he be able to stop Beerus from rampaging?! {\blur1}No! Absolutely not! {\blur1}You can't go to the party! {\blur1}Why not? Just a while ago you were  talkin' like you wanted me to go. {\blur1}And you said you didn't want to! {\blur1}Well, yeah... {\blur1}Anyway, the power of the Sage Beans sure is amazin'! I'm completely healed up! {\blur1}I shouldn't have given you one... {\blur1}You okay, Kaio-sama? {\blur1}Not in the slightest! {\blur1}I feel like all this anxiety is gonna shorten my lifespan! {\blur1}What lifespan? You're already dead, ain't ya? {\blur1}What? {\blur1}Fine, I got it! So I gotta stay  away from the party, right? {\blur1}Oh, so you understand? {\blur1}The destruction of the universe ain't nothin' to joke about. {\blur1}I'll just wait it out here. {\blur1}Yes, that's good. {\blur1}But can I really keep myself here? I ain't so sure... {\blur1}Oh, my... {\blur1}I really don't know what to do about Vegeta. {\blur1}Excuse me. {\blur1}Hey, what?! {\blur1}Kakarrotto, taken out in just two hits? {\blur1}Damn it... {\blur1}I, Vegeta-sama, am frightened?! {\blur1}Beerus, the God of Destruction... {\blur1}I know I've heard that name before. {\blur1\fad(0,200)}But where? {\blur1}Hi, Prince Vegeta. {\blur1}Just my imagination? {\blur1}Bang! {\blur1}Greetings. {\blur1}Who are you?! {\blur1}Do I really have to give my name? {\blur1}After all, you are already dead.{Kenshiro anyone?} {\blur1}W-Why you...! {\blur1}I... I can't move?! {\blur5}Do you know why I'm so upset right now? {\blur5}Do you? {\blur5}B-Because I couldn't carry out your orders before the agreed deadline...{these two should be combined}{like this?}{Yes} {\blur5}Wrong. {\blur5}He's got Dad on his knees... {\blur5}You gotta be kidding me. Who is that guy?! {\blur5}I'm a very generous god. {\blur5}But there's just one thing I absolutely cannot stand. {\blur5}And that is the insensitivity of people who won't give me my due respect! {\blur5}I ordered you to bring me the most comfortable pillow in the universe. {\blur5}So you stole it from some planet somewhere. {\blur5}I don't know how many people you killed to get it... {\blur5}You then kept that one to yourself, and  gave me the second most comfortable one! {\blur5}What, did you think I wouldn't notice?! {\blur5}D-Don't get cocky! {\blur1}The God of Destruction... {\blur1}Beerus... {\blur1}I can see HIM being able to take  out Kakarrotto in two hits... {\blur1}I hoped you might have grown up into someone worth hanging out with to kill some time... {\blur1}This was disappointing.{retime these two}{done} {\blur1}I should have destroyed your planet back then. {\blur1}Say... {\blur1}Does the name "Super Saiyan God" ring a bell to you? {\blur1}"Super Saiyan God"? {\blur1}Seems you don't know. {\blur1}Oh, this was where you were? {\blur1}Vegeta! {\blur1}Stay back! {\blur1}Don't be so rude towards the lady, Prince Vegeta. {\blur1}It seems he's had a bit too much to drink. {\blur1}Who might you be? {\blur1}Oh, pardon me. My name is Whis. {\blur1}And this is my master, Beerus-sama. {\blur1}We were just dropping by the Earth and happened to spot Vegeta-san. {\blur1}Oh, how unexpected. You actually have friends! {\blur1}Come to think of it, you don't  really look like you're from Earth. {\blur1}H-Hey! {\blur1}I'm Vegeta's wife, Bulma. {\blur1}It's an honour to meet you. {\blur1}Would you like to join our celebration? {\blur1}It's my birthday today. You're both welcome. {\blur1}Why, thank you very much for the kind offer. {\blur1}Actually, I've felt rather attracted by this delicious scent for a while now... {\blur1}Then let's go. {\blur1}W-Wait! {\blur1}Attention, everyone! {\blur1}These are Vegeta's friends, Beerus-san and Whis-san. {\blur1}Good afternoon! {\blur1}Hello, nice to meet you! {\blur1}It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. {\blur1}I suppose as long as he stays in a good mood, this won't cause any harm... {\blur1}Those likely to cause unnecessary trouble ARE here, huh? {\blur1}This is Yumcha. {\blur1}How do you do? {\blur1}No need to be so formal. {\blur1}I mean sure, I've been in this group longer than most... {\blur1}Plus, and I shouldn't say this too loud, {\blur1}I'm also a contender for the best martial artist around. {\blur1}I can see why you'd be nervous. {\blur1}Still, it's a party, after all. Who cares about ranks? {\blur1}That idiot! {\blur1}Sorry for the wait! {\blur1}Ta-daah! {\blur1}What's this? {\blur1}I've never seen this dish before. {\blur1}Well, this is... {\blur1}Russian Octopus Balls! {\blur1}It's set up so that a single ball {\blur1}filled with heaps of wasabi instead of octopus meat was added to the mix! {\blur1}Now let's have some fun! {\blur1}You fool! {\blur1}Cut the crap! {\blur1}What's your problem? Killjoy. {\blur1}Yeah, don't be such a killjoy. {\blur1}I don't know what this wasabi thing is... {\blur1}...but these Russian Octopus Balls do look incredibly tempting. {\blur1}It looks rather similar to the super sweet black cherry sauce from Planet Banna. {\blur1}It smells rather different, though. {\blur1}Quiet you. We'll know once we try it. {\blur1}Oh, you're taking the first bite? Here's one who gets it! {\blur1}Yeah! Beerus! Beerus! {\blur1}Beerus! Beerus! Beerus! {\blur1}C-Calm down... There are so many of them... {\blur1}There's no way he'd hit upon the one with wasabi in it on his first try. {\blur1}Please... {\blur1}{EYECATCHES} {\blur1}It's all over... {\blur1}Delicious! {\blur1}The chewy texture of octopus {\blur1}lurking inside this fluffy wheat ball! {\blur1}How did I never know about this combination before?! {\blur1}The sauce was great, too! Absolutely wonderful! {\blur1}It truly is exquisite. Let us  add this to today's dinner menu. {\blur1}There's no wasabi in this one. Thank goodness! {\blur1}You dummy. At this point, the one with wasabi in it would taste way better than the others! {\blur1}Darn, I didn't get it. {\blur1}I'm gonna have a heart attack... {\blur1}See? Everyone got all fired up, right? {\blur1}Why is it always me? {\blur1}This is so peaceful... {\blur1}So this is how good it feels to be full... {\blur1}I'd completely forgotten. {\blur1}Conquering the world is starting to seem like too much effort. {\blur1}Yeah, you're right... {\blur1}No, what the hell are you saying?! {\blur1}World conquest is the very reason the Pilaf Gang exists! {\blur1}I refuse to give up on that goal, no matter what! {\blur1}The Dragon Balls are here on this ship! {\blur1}If you've got time to spare, why not help us bag the leftovers? {\blur1}Yeah... {\blur1}Darn. {\blur1}Aw geez... {\blur1}I'm not done yet! {\blur1}Trunks-kun, you meanie! {\blur1}They're half Earthling...  And only children, too. {\blur1}There's another one, too, but he's in that state... {\blur1}Super Saiyan God... Where are you? {\blur1}Sorry to have kept you waiting! {\blur1}Have a pyramid of octopus balls! {\blur1}Thank you. {\blur1}Much obliged. {\blur1}So, what now? {\blur1}I don't have any other leads to go by, and I'm completely full. {\blur1}Maybe I should just go home and take a nap? {\blur1}Yes, that's it... Go back to your own planet already! {\blur1}Say... {\blur1}Yes? {\blur1}About that guy on Planet Kaio... Uh, what was his name again? {\blur1}Son Goku. {\blur1}Yeah, yeah, Goku. {\blur1}What's the relationship between you and him? {\blur1}W-Well, I guess we're like rivals... {\blur1}You guess? {\blur1}You Saiyans sure have changed since I last saw you. {\blur1}You've become so meek. {\blur1}Oh, crap! {\blur1}We're sorry! {\blur1}Oh, God...! {\blur1}Are you angry? {\blur1}Is that what it looks like? {\blur1}Yes. {\blur1}Wrong. I'm not angry. {\blur1}I'm super angry! {\blur1}What's he doing? {\blur1}No idea... {\blur1}Octopus, octopus, octopus... {\blur1}Octopus, octopus... {\blur1}I'm gonna bring you some fluffy,  crunchy treats in a second! {\blur1}Hold the wasabi this time, okay? {\blur1}Somehow I don't feel that angry anymore. {\blur1}Being angry makes you hungry, too. {\blur1}Anyway, Beerus-sama. Did you try the dessert called pudding? {\blur1}Pudding? {\blur1}It has quite the smooth texture and tastes lovely. {\blur1}What? Where is it? {\blur1}Well then... {\blur1}You're going above and beyond to liven up your beloved wife's birthday party... {\blur1}I've misjudged you, Vegeta. {\blur1}Shut uuuup... {\blur1}Pardon me. The person at the stand told us he was all sold out... {\blur1}Could you please share a single one of those puddings with us? {\blur1}See? I told you you shouldn't  hog them all to your own. {\blur1}Oh, so this is it... {\blur1}It's all wobbly and smooth... {\blur1}It looks delicious! {\blur1}I'm sorry about that. Don't just ask for one, you should both have one. {\blur1}No. They're all mine! {\blur1}Come on... {\blur1}Pardon me. We came from  a distant planet, you see. {\blur1}If we miss out on this "pudding" food now, there's no telling when we'll get to eat it again. So... {\blur1}I'm strong. So I have to eat a lot. {\blur1}You got a problem with that? {\blur1}So that's your reasoning? {\blur1}Crap! {\blur1}Wait! I'll make up for this! {\blur1}Scram. {\blur1}S-Stop it! {\blur1}Oh my... {\blur1}Fly away! {\blur1}I'm a very generous god. {\blur1}But there's just one thing I absolutely cannot stand. {\blur1}And that is the insensitivity of people who won't give me my due respect! {\blur1}It's over... {\blur1\fad(0,200)}It's all over... {\blur1}Yo! It's me, Goku! {\blur1}Beerus-sama finally got angry. {\blur1}Wait, Piccolo! Gohan! Oh, not you too, Gotenks! {\blur1}The birthday party's a complete mess! {\blur1}There ain't no way Bulma's gonna stand by and watch that happen! {\blur1}Vegeta, what's wrong? {\blur1}It ain't like you to just stand there and do nothin'! {\blur1}Next time, on Dragon Ball Super: {\blur1}"How Dare You Hurt My Bulma?!  Vegeta's Total, Furious Change?!" {\blur1}Don't miss it! {\blur2\fad(200,200)}Dragon Ball Super was brought to you by Bandai and these sponsors.
