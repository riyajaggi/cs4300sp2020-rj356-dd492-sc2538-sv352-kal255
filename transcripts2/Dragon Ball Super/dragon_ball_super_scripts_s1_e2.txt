   Translated by @ElSpark15 Thanks to the power of the Dragon Balls... Majin Buu was erased from the memories of everyone on Earth And life on Earth was normal once again. Everyone thinks it was me who saved the Earth They gave me a prize It's 100 million Zeni 100 Million Zeni?! So ChiChi, do you think I could go train on King Kai's planet? Yes, but please come back every once in a while... Alright!!! Okay, see ya later! While Goku was training on King Kai's planet At that time, in another corner of the universe, something incredible was happening... This time I'll only destroy half. To the promised resort! Vegeta goes on a family trip?! Today is such a great day for a drive. It's been so calm. Peace is just the best. Peace is the path to La Paz... How strange... strange strange It's the path between peace and La Paz. You don't understand my word games Bubbles, you got a lot to learn. Let's change the pace, let's run! Don't ever show up without calling again! This is so good! But, we got lots of time, you could easily fix all of this. You don't understand. Fix this stuff yourself and tell me how fun it is... Anyways, what are you here for Goku? I came(nom) here(nom) to... Stop talking while you eat!!! I'm full. What did I come here for? Oh yeah! I came here to train! Gravity is 10 times what it is on Earth, right? Nothing better then some gravity training! Ahhh. Am I intruding? Hey, you have to stop treating me like I am some 24 hour motel. Don't be so mean, we're old friends. Maybe you've forgotten just how important I am! I am much more important then other deities! Well, alright then... Wait! I am already pretty full anyway. Did you even hear anything that I said!? Alright let's do this. Time to train! We're almost there. Wake up Trunks! We're taking so long. If you could fly like us, it wouldn't even take us a minute to get there. Hey! My body isn't made like yours! Is dad still on top of the ship? Yeah... honestly Saiyans are so weird. This serves no purpose, unlike training. Well if you like to train so much, I'll make you train! That's not all! This is nothing. I don't like it. I won't wear it. I think I'm getting these shades. Mom look! What do you think about this necklace? Trunks, you alright in there? I'm fine! Hey. What? Stopping your training you love so much to come with us on a vacation What's gotten over you? If you can land one blow on me, I'll take you to the amusement park. Wait, don't cry! We're going to the amusement park. I'm just keeping a promise. A promise? You made a promise to Trunks? I like this place better then amusment parks. Well you're doing something good. Stop being a bother! Hey, Vegeta. I don't know what it is, but ever since you fought Buu, something in you has changed. Tadaa! Yay! Look dad, do you like it? I don't care! And anyways. You put your buttons on wrong Oh no! It's alright. Let's go over there! I can't see! Hey, can't you help him with some of those? I am hungry. Fine then! Hey, bring us more food! This is delicious! All this food is making him a lot less moody. Bring us more! This is delicious. More food please! This ocotopus is delicious. I will eat it all! Dad... Vegeta... Damn it! Vegeta, stay calm. Let's get out of here. Okay, let's go. Sorry for the fuss, you guys are welcome to have what's left. I like this. It's beautiful. We could rent a first class boat and have my birthday party on it. That would be great! Where did he go? Dad! Dad! Where are you? Don't fly! Where is he? While I'm here just wasting time, Kakarot. How hard is he training? It's time for the Dance of Fire! Let's keep enjoying this party! Oh yeah! Let's go! Waisoo! After defeating Majin Buu, he became the undisputed number one in the universe. But even now he keeps training. Also... Oh yeah! This place... I can't waste anymore time... Here! Hey, you there, quit being a party pooper! Why don't you come on stage Guy and dance with us!? Guy, get up here! Guy! Guy! Guy! Guy! Guy! Do whatever you want! He flew away! Incredible! I don't remember having any sort of main attraction like that Dad's gone! For being Vegeta, he put up with it for quite awhile. Dad! I had lots of fun! Thanks! What was that? I can almost remember it. It's on the tip of my tongue. Whis. Is it ready yet? Whis! There's still two minutes left. Lord Beerus. Sorry to bug you while you are resting. Dinosaur meat. It is very delicious. It's number 7 most popular in the universe. Sorry to take your food, but... We're taking this. ?Grunt? Eh, what do you think you're doing? ?Grunt? Kafun... ?Conversation in alien language? Lord Beerus said not to take more then 3 minutes. If you hurry up and give this to me it would help alot. That way you wouldn't have any problems. It's the best thing for me and you. ?Alien language? Geez... Looks like you can transform for battle. I guess I didn't do enough research. Unfortunately, I only have 40 seconds left. However, your time is up. It's only been 2 minutes and 20 seconds. Really? It feels like I've waited 220 years. Why are you so cranky after waking up? Dinosaur meat is rich and juicy. It's not just some fly by rumor. I just want to taste it so bad. The flavor so striking and powerful. I felt like this could help me remember the person I saw in my dream. A dream? It was a premonition. The premonitions of Lord Beerus aren't always on point. Last time, you said a Idol would move close to us. But yet nobody came... Are you kidding me? You. You are boring. Fire? Back at you. Is he done? I hate the guys who don't have a shred of knowledge. Anyways. Where were we? You said you forgot the person you saw in your premonition. Oh yeah, I am remembering it now, however... I feel kind of bad. I feel like I have bone in my teeth. It's like something is tickling me behind the ears. Get it? Lord Beerus... What should I do with the dinosaur meat? I don't want it anymore. I don't think it will be as good as I imagined... Elder Kai, what's going on? You don't like the tea? So you didn't feel it? What are you talking about? Damnit Kid! We are in trouble, big trouble. It's the person who has shown up in 30 million years. The God of Destruction, Lord Beerus, has awoken! This is where I will start my training. One, Two, Three, Four! Time to start! Kakarot! I've accepted the fact that you are the strongest Saiyan. Stop that! I had just gotten to a good place. But even so, Kakarot. I have no interest in being the second best! One day I will surpass you! No... I will surpas everyone in this universe! I will be above all! I thought I was done, but... No matter how many times I see it, watching things blow up will never get old. The dinosaur meat, you really don't want it? I don't want it. What I want to say is... Yes A warrior so extreme with power like none have ever seen. Someone who could entertain me endlessly. His name... What's his name? What was it again? Super... Super... Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan God? Eh? I think that was his name. Wow. Let's remember it while we eat something at home. Let's do it. Teletransportation.
