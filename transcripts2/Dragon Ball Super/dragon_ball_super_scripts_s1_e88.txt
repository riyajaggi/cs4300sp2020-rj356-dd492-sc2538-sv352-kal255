   ♪ Opening Theme Song plays... [♪♪] *DRAGON BALL SUPER (DUBBED)* Original one : Season 01 Episode 88 (Dubbed one TV release : S05 E12) ♪ Don't you know I'm unstoppable? ♪ ♪ Don't even try, 'cause you will fall ♪ ♪ I got a strength, deep in my soul, ♪ ♪ that gives me courage and control ♪ ♪ I'll go beyond the limit break ♪ ♪ The universe is mine to take ♪ ♪ I have no fear, I think it's clear ♪ ♪ Let's kick it up into high gear ♪ ♪ Oh this is Dragon Ball Super ♪ ♪ We've got the skills to blow Zeno away! ♪ [♪♪] [♪♪] [NARRATOR] Previously, on Dragon Ball Super, Goku visited the nature preserve where Android 17 works and tried to recruit him for the Tournament of Power. [A17] Look, it's not about the job. It's about the island. I can't afford to leave it. [NARRATOR] But just as 17 refused, alien poachers arrived and stole the island's animals! [GOKU yells] I have a highly powerful self-destruct device implanted inside my body. [gasps] [POACHER BOSS] Do you really want me to turn all of us, including your precious animals, into space debris? [A17] Okay, Goku. I'll let you take it from here. [POACHER BOSS screams] [NARRATOR] With the poachers defeated, and the animals returned to the island, 17 made a surprising decision. [A17] All right, fine. I'm in. - [GOKU] Hm? -[A17] I'll join your team for the tournament. I don't like being in debt to anybody. I'll leave Trunks and Goten in charge of the island and just hope they're up to it. [NARRATOR] 17 is ready to fight on the biggest stage of them all! But what about his teammates? Find out now! [♪♪] [NARRATOR] "Gohan and Piccolo. Master and Pupil Clash in Max Training!" Episoe Title: "Gohan and Piccolo. Master and Pupil Clash in Max Training!" [GOHAN grunting] [GOHAN panting] So, that's where your skills are at these days, huh? [GOHAN grunts] [PICCOLO] I'll be honest. After you guys won the Zeno Expo, Goku paid me a visit. Uh? Wait. So then my Dad already told you everything? Yeah. He told me about your performance... How well you did there, and how if we lose the Tournament, our universe gets destroyed. Fine. You just found yourself another teammate, Goku. Yeah? [PICCOLO] The best fighters in the Cosmos, fighting for their very existence? You won't find a tournament with stakes higher than that! I knew that once I explained it, you'd be excited to join the team! [PICCOLO chuckles] Speaking of team, how's Gohan? Think he can do this? [GOKU] Well, considering how little he fights these days, I think he handled himself pretty well at the Expo. On the other hand, we both know how much power he's got locked deep down. He could do way more. [PICCOLO] Hmm... Do you have any senzu beans? [GOKU] Hm? No, not on me. Why? [PICCOLO] Go get me two. I'm going to whip Gohan back into shape for the Tournament of Power. [GOKU] No argument here. Whatever helps the team! Be glad that I got these senzu beans, Gohan. 'Cause from here on out, things get tough. Oh, I'm ready, Piccolo. If we're gonna win this thing, I need to be stronger than I've ever been before! [yells] Huh? [yelling continues] [GOHAN yells] [GOHAN grunting] [groans] [GOHAN grunts] That all you got? [BULLA cries] Wait, is this side the front? Or... is it this? The problem isn't that it's upside down, it's that you're holding it inside out. [TRUNKS] Inside out...? Oh. That explains why these thingies weren't sticking. Yeah, a healthy baby girl, named Bulla. No, Bull-uh, with an "A" at the end. Oh, I'm glad you like it. I think it's cute, too! I'll text you some pics. She totally looks like me. [BULLA cries] [TRUNKS, GOTEN gasping] Human babies are hard. [BEERUS growls] [TRUNKS] Dad, help! [VEGETA] Hmph. Watch and learn! [VEGETA grunting] [BULLA coos] Whoa, that was awesome! Diaper master! [VEGETA chuckles] [TRUNKS] You're way more fun when you're not crying! Oh, yeah. She got all her cute-ness from my side! [BULMA laughs] Our universe could be a day away from total annihilation, and they're lounging around, yucking it up! The old saying, "ignorance is bliss," feels appropriate, sir. [BEERUS] We should tell them the truth, for their own good. My Lord, with everything we know of this group, I would recommend we avoid doing that. [BEERUS] Huh? I'd like you to think for a moment how Bulma would react. What? If we lose they'll wipe out our universe?! And I'm assuming that this is all your fault! What? I had nothing to do with this! Your problem's with Goku, not me! He's the one who put this thing in Grand Zeno's head! If Goku did this by himself, why didn't you stop him! Well. Of course, I tried to, but it just didn't work out. How could you not know by now that when you leave Goku alone like that, it always ends in major trouble! How can you call yourself a God with a straight face?! You dumbbell! [BULMA, WHIS] You bone-headed, stupid, moronic, dope of a deity! Nobody likes you! Stop that! Oh, my. So, then, what'll it be? Are you ready to take on "Hurricane Bulma"? Don't worry about a gift. Bulla's already got more stuff than she knows what to do with! [BEERUS growls] No thanks. I'm good. [MARRON laughs] [signing] Hey, kids, your Daddy's home! [yells] [MARRON] How was work, honey? You hit lots of buttons on your computer? Whoa. I know bickering is a part of any marriage, but this is a bit much. [laughing]/font>/font> [WOMEN laugh] Yeah! Kick each other's butts! [WOMEN gasp] [A18] Hi-yah! Mama, you won again! You're running out of time to improve. [groans] That really hurt. You're supposed to pull your punches! When we win, I'm taking your ten million zeni and there's nothing you can do about it. Sweetie, I'll buy you any toy you want with your father's prize cut, okay? [sighs] So much for my dream of upgrading the home gym with a steam room. [GOHAN, PICCOLO grunting] [GOHAN groaning] [GOHAN panting] I'm not... down yet... I will protect... my friends and my family. You're just psyching yourself up. [gasps] [PICCOLO] Telling yourself you have to win isn't training, Gohan. It's pointless. You need to face reality, and do the real work. If you can't tap into your true power, all the motivation in the world won't be enough to protect Videl and Pan. [GOHAN gasps] [PICCOLO] Sure, having something to defend or fight for can drive you. But when feelings dominate, they can just as quickly drag you down. You want your emotions to complement your strength, not shackle it! [GOHAN grunting] [PICCOLO] If you're too desperate to win... If love makes you afraid... You won't be able to assess the fight logically. You'll misjudge your opponent's abilities and lose. [GOHAN] So that's it. That's what I've been doing wrong. [GOHAN screams] There's no such thing as a fight that can't be lost! If we lose, our entire universe will be destroyed. You must accept that fact, and come to terms with it. Only then can you prevail. All right. [PICCOLO] Hmph. You can do this, Gohan. You can win. - Huh? - [PICCOLO] I believe in you. Now believe in yourself. Piccolo. I won't let you down. [CABBA] Unbelievable. We're in a fight with our universe's existence at stake. I don't care how strong Hit is, there are no sure things when you're fighting 70 warriors from across the Cosmos. Building the right team is critical. Which means I have no choice but to ask him. [whirring] [RENSO] Hm? [RENSO spits] [knocking] [CABBA] Renso, sir? It's Cabba! Huh? Cabba? [RENSO yelps] [crash] [CABBA] Huh? Uh! Renso! Hey, easy, are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Just got a little too excited. Heard your voice and forgot about my bum leg! [CABBA] Hm? [RENSO] Well. What can I say, Cabba, it's been too long. I've tried to keep up with your career, though. I was so proud to hear you're now an ace in the Sadala Defense Force's Saiyan Elite Corps. I couldn't have done it if not for your training, Captain. [laughs] I'm retired now. Oh. I see. Anyway. I hear you've mastered a new fighting move. You wanna show off for your old mentor? [CABBA] Heh. Sure! [yells] Whoa! That's more impressive than I was expecting! With you out there, our universe is in good hands. [gasps] Well, sir, now that you mention it... [RENSO] Uh? [RENSO] What? Wiped out? [CABBA] Please. I'm here to ask you to join our team! We need all the help we can get if we're gonna survive! I can't. I retired from the Defense Force. And besides, with my bum leg... But you wouldn't be fighting like you did in the old days. Grand Zeno has decreed that it be an 80-man battle royale. So just having your combat experience on hand will be a huge help for the team. [RENSO] You give me too much credit. You have to! We're talking about the existence of our whole universe! [RENSO grunts] [CABBA] Renso! [RENSO] You need the best team of fighters possible. If I'm there, I'll just be a burden. There is one way I can help you, though. The fighter you should be recruiting is Caulifla. Uh. Wait. Caulifla, as in... your sister? [RENSO] Think she can't do it? No, I think she's an amazing fighter, it's just that I sometimes... Well, we sometimes don't see eye-to-eye, is all. [RENSO laughs] I know, she's a rebel. A punk, if I'm being blunt. But still, Caulifla's latent abilities far outclass my own. [CABBA] What? They do? [panting] I think we've both warmed up enough. From here on out, the gloves are off. Come at me as hard as you can! [GOHAN] Right! [yells] You're strong, that much I'm aware of. But you have another weakness. And unless you can overcome it, you won't last long in the Tournament. And if you lose, our universe won't be far behind. I'm gonna show you your weakness. [GOHAN, PICCOLO grunting] [PICCOLO groans] [gasps] Ha! [GOHAN gasping] Told ya I was takin' the gloves off! [PICCOLO yells] [PICCOLO] What's the matter, Gohan? Is that all you've got? Don't blame me when you black out! I'm... not giving up yet! Piccolo, when did you get so powerful? Did you really think I was sittin' on my hands all this time, while you had your head buried in some textbook? [groaning] [GOHAN screams] [GOHAN coughs] [PICCOLO] Gohan, it's over. You're strong, but you lack... Well... You just might not have the heart of a true warrior. If there's a chance to win, you have to close the deal. [gasps] It's an old problem. Remember when you fought Majin Buu, after the Elder Kai drew out your power? You were overcome by a different feeling: arrogance. You had struggled for so long to unlock your potential that when you did, you enjoyed it too much. Instead of using your strength to win, your arrogance left you open to attack. Succumb to that again, and you'll lose no matter how powerful you are. Be a warrior! No matter the opponent, you fight with everything you've got! All right, Piccolo. This time, I won't let you down. [yelling] Ha. I want to see something even more powerful than just Super Saiyan! [GOHAN grunting] [PICCOLO] Show me the power you had when you fought against Buu! Re-awaken the fighter you truly are! [gasping] How's that? So is this what you wanted to see? That's perfect, Gohan. [yells] Cloning, huh? [PICCOLO CLONES yell] [GOHAN grunts] [GOHAN grunts] [gasps] [GOHAN] Piccolo! [PICCOLO] Yes, that's it. That's good. Huh?! If you can fight like this in the Tournament, then those other universes don't stand a chance against our team. Thank you, Piccolo. [PICCOLO chuckles] [screams] [GOHAN groans] But you didn't close the deal. It's the same thing that happened when you fought against Buu. You thought you defeated him, and dropped your guard. Which allowed him to sneak up from behind and absorb you! [GOHAN gasps] It's not entirely your fault. Your father often makes the same mistake. Don't you forget this. Stay focused. Drop your arrogance and keep your guard up until the tournament's over. Right. [PICCOLO] Good! Let's go again! [GOHAN] Ready when you are! [DINOSAUR screams] [DINOSAUR cries] [GOHAN] All right, Piccolo. Thanks again for the training. Oh, no. Your training is only getting started. - [GOHAN] What? - [PICCOLO] Listen, I believe that what you tapped into today was actually a fraction of your latent power. We pushed through one wall and now I wanna find the next. [PICCOLO] Aren't you curious? Don't you wanna know how strong you truly are? Don't settle for being better, when you could be the best. Tournament doesn't start till tomorrow. We still have a little time. Let's put it to good use. You wanna be stronger than you've ever been, right? Stronger than I've ever been. Yeah. Let's do it! Oh, and since we'll be hangin' out together, maybe we can come up with some combos moves, too? [PICCOLO] Combo moves, huh? [GOHAN] Yeah! We'll need every advantage we can get. [PICCOLO] Interesting... [PICCOLO chuckles] All right, why not! [NARRATOR] Thanks to Piccolo's intensive training, Gohan's preparations for the tournament are proceeding quickly. We are now just 9 hours and 30 minutes away from the start of the Tournament of Power! What is the depth of Gohan's abilities? What combo moves can he and Piccolo master in the remaining time? How well can they fight as a team? And most importantly: who will take the final slots for the Seventh Universe? [YAMCHA] All right, he'll ask me, but first I'm gonna play hard-to-get. "The 'Tournament of Power?, ' eh? I'd love to, but I've already got plans to wash my hair that night." Or, wait. Maybe I should go for false modesty. "But I'm not on your level, Goku. I'd only hold the rest of you back." Nah, that doesn't sound believable. - [YAMCHA] Uh. What should I do? - Oh... My poor Yamcha. [YAMCHA] And what's with him taking so long to ask? I mean, really, Puar. Don't you think he should have been here by now! Wait! Knowing Goku, he'll just use Instant Transmission! Goku, are you here yet?! No? Okay, what about here? Ah, you can zap yourself in anytime now! I'm waiting! Anytime, Goku! - Ha, ha, ha... - ♪ End Theme Song plays... ♪ Boogie Back! ♪ [♪♪] [♪♪] ♪ My heartbeat keeps growing faster ♪ ♪ Every step that I take ♪ ♪ Brings me back to you ♪ ♪ Boogie Back! ♪ ♪ Give me happy ever after ♪ ♪ Let the dream of our love come truuuuuue ♪ ♪ Boogie Back! ♪ ♪ Boogie Back! ♪ Sync corrections by srjanapala
