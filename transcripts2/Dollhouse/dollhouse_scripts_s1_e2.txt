 Dollhouse (2009â€“2010): Season 1, Episode 2 - The Target - full transcript 
 Echo becomes the ultimate outdoorswoman when a handsome young client, Richard Connell, hires her as a date for a wilderness adventure. But unknown to the Dollhouse, Richard's true sport is hunting humans - with Echo intended as his next victim. Meanwhile, Agent Ballard continues investigating the origins of the Dollhouse, hindered by both his skeptical superior Tanaka, and his colleagues who continues to dismiss it as a legend. Eventually, Ballard receives a clue about Echo/Caroline's past from an anonymous source. Also, periodic flashbacks show how Boyd came to work for Adelle and be assigned as Echo's handler, his first meeting with tech Topher, and how Dr. Claire Saunders received her facial scars from the shadowy Alpha; a rogue active who may or may not still be on the loose.

 - What's that sound? - It's nothing. Please get into your beds. We haven't had our shower. We always shower before... Everything's all right. Please get into your beds. Secure the exits. Anyone tries to breach, shoot them in the head, twice. Yes, sir. Topher. Topher! - Guns. Can I have one? - What happened? Yeah. That's the thing, happened. - He just... - Who? Doc Saunders looks like a jigsaw puzzle, and what he did to Samuelson...

 - Who? - Alpha. It appears we've had a composite event. He gets wiped after every engagement, like all the rest. How could he composite? Can't. Shouldn't. Did. Target acquired. - Where? - Level 3, Corridor 37. Target... Move out. Seriously? A gun? They won't wake up. Negative contact.

 - Continuing sweep. - Copy that. In their resting state, our Actives are as innocent and vulnerable as children. We call it the tabula rasa, the blank slate. Now imagine the imprint process filling it, creating a new personality. A friend, a lover, a confidant in a sea of enemies. Your heart's desire made flesh. And when the engagement has been completed, all memory of you and your time together will be wiped clean. Hello, Echo. How are you feeling? Did I fall asleep? For a little while. Shall I go now? If you like. Neat trick. Tricks are illusions, Mr. Connell, constructed to deceive. What we offer is truth. A rare commodity. Hence the exuberant price tag. I've been with a lot of women, Miss DeWitt. That's not bragging. That's just what you would call truth. And not one of them turned out to be who they said they were. Your services may be expensive, but at least this time, I'll be the one telling the girl what to lie about. She won't lie to you, Mr. Connell. Everything you want, everything you need, she will be. Honestly and completely. That will be something new. There is, however, one small problem. I thought everything was good with the background check. That's not our concern. Your engagement has been flagged as a moderate risk to our Active. Nothing serious. Our company policy requires a small additional fee against any unforeseen complications. Small, huh? To my employers, very. Well, if this girl's everything you promise, it will be worth it. Just make sure you return her safe and sound. Otherwise, there will be additional costs. I'll keep it low-key. - All right. - Not bad. Not bad. You should see me on a five. - Thought that was a five. - No way. Three, three and a half, maybe. If it were a five, I'd be fishing you out of the drink. You think so, huh? And so. Now get your ass moving before I leave you for the wolves, or whatever they've got around here that eats guys who can't keep up. Yes, ma'am. You know what they say about looking down. Don't? Really don't. Are you okay? Yeah. Jenny! Oh, God. Oh, God, the look on your face. That's not funny. You know how much trouble I'd be in if you went splat? Yeah. My brothers would kill you. Quit screwing around. All right, wuss. Come on. Let's race to the top. Everything looks beautiful from here. Vitals are right online. What about her adrenaline? It's within engagement parameters. Are you sure? She's elevating toward redline. Relax, mountain man. I've been reading the squigglies long enough to discern the diff between excitement and "Sweet mother, I'm gonna die." She's fine. Hey, go soak up some nature. Okay, like, smell the honey. Hassle a grizzly. Leave the science to the science guy. Well, how about clearing up my signal, professor? My displays are crap. You're in the middle of "Why would anyone want to be there?" What did you expect, HBO? Can't you re-task one of the auxiliary satellites, give me some more coverage? What's the magic word? Please. I was actually looking for "abracadabra," but that will do. Okay, re-tasking satellite 7115. It's gonna take a few to move it into alignment. - Thanks. - Anything for you. 'Cause I love you. Deep, deep man-love. The woods. Yep. I hate the woods. Yep. Thanks. Doesn't add up, does it? Ballard? What the hell are you doing here? This is a straight kidnap. - What doesn't add up? - Yeah. Why don't you give us the inside view on how this all leads to the Dollhouse? Or, alternate plan, why don't you just let us do our jobs? Doesn't add up, does it? Not all of it. We got three pros come up from Mexico and a disgruntled science teacher. They take the Crestejo girl for ransom, they fall out and make everybody's life easier. But the money's gone. So there's a fifth guy, and he's right now loving life. He the one packing the cannon? He'd have to be. That weapon's not here. Fifth guy took it. After he blows the door? Which is funny. He's in the room with his buddies, then he has to blow the door? So, no fifth guy. You think Crestejo sent someone after them? Well, he swears he didn't. Hey, tell me you didn't go near my vic. I just hear the talk. Crestejo's an interesting guy, though. Fits a certain profile. Yeah, I know. He's rich, he's respectable, but maybe he's got a kinky side he doesn't want anyone to see, so he goes to the world-famous Dollhouse and hires himself a pretty lady to groove his move and then forget all about it. They can do that, you know, with science. That's what Davina called her. Huh? Crestejo's daughter. She said the pretty lady came and saved her. - You did talk... - Shaw, we get any pretty-lady prints? We got the dead guys and the kid, no one else. Will you stop humoring him? And a couple of areas definitely wiped down. So what? The Dollhouse sends one of its brainwashed beauties to take out a kidnapping ring? That's a full-service organization. It's the little girl's, right? I'd check it out. Hey. Agent Ballard thinks we should investigate. Thanks for the tip. Why don't you just leave us to it and go find your pretty lady? - I will. - Be careful. Looks here like she's pretty badass. Carbon shaft, three-blade broadhead. Damn! You'll scare away lunch. You couldn't have packed a couple sandwiches? Sandwiches don't give you a run when you try to eat them. They just lay there waiting for mustard. I like mustard. Here. All right? You're gripping too tight here. Hang on. Relax your hand. You want the riser to just rest there, pressing against your palmar crease. Sounds dirty. It's your lifeline, in your palm. You grip the riser too hard, your shot will torque. You're pretty good at this, aren't you? My dad taught me. He was a big believer in... What? Was that a salute? Do I have to learn a salute? It's shoulder to the wheel. Do the work, earn your way. If you can bring down something bigger than you with just this, you proved you deserve to eat it. If it gets away, it proved it deserves to live, and you go hungry. Dad thought we all take too much for granted. And you? I appreciate every moment. Particularly this one. I'm not the first one you've brought into the woods, am I? No. But so far, you're the only one that hasn't been a disappointment. Richard. What do I do? Extend your bow arm. Now draw back. Keep your elbow high. That's right. Never take a shot unless you're sure it'll put your target down. Aim for the flank, right below the shoulders. Now just release. Is there anything you're not good at? I think that little thing I did with my tongue could use some work. You really are the perfect woman. Not too shabby yourself. You don't slow down, do you? I like to live. A lot. Let's see who finishes first this round. I might even let you win. I'd like that. You have no idea how much, but you need to get going. Going? Where? There's just enough daylight left to make it back to the main road. Might even flag a ride out of here before I catch up. Yeah, okay. Am I missing something? - Richard? - You need to stop talking now and start running. I'll give you a five-minute head start. And then I'm coming after you. Welcome to the Dollhouse, Mr. Langton. You come highly recommended. So the stories are true. Programmable people, made to order. It's a little more complicated than that. I figured it might be. Science is very seldom exact, Mr. Langton. Being on the cutting edge invites a certain element of risk. Which is why you're here. In light of recent events, we've decided to engage individuals with a more, shall we say, intensive background. If you're amenable to the terms of your contract, you will be assigned to Echo, one of our most requested Actives. What happened to her last Handler? You're standing in him. This is our resident physician, Dr. Saunders. Mr. Langton, who will be replacing Samuelson. Good. Does that mean I can get his body out of my office? We'll take care of it. Right. Right. Everything's under control. It's nice to have you on the team. Watch where you step. Her face. Dr. Saunders is still recovering. Same guy who killed Samuelson? She was more fortunate. I want to see Samuelson's body. You really don't. Show me. Samuelson. He was a good man. Not good enough. What do you make? Single blade, non-serrated, 10 to 12 centimeters. Tendons in the extremities were severed first to disable him. And then the real work started. Knew exactly where to cut to cause the maximum amount of damage and pain. Whoever did this took their time. Eight seconds. That's the timeline we've been able to piece together. The cuts are meticulous, almost surgical. Wouldn't have thought it was possible to carve up a man like this so fast. It isn't. Unless you've been imprinted with the necessary skills. You're telling me you programmed one of your dolls to be Jack the Ripper? Not my department. All I know is that Alpha accessed multiple imprints, personalities that should have been erased. And one of them did this, and slaughtered everyone around your girl before pulling a smoke-and-mirrors. So, why didn't he kill Echo? Whoa! Whoa! You don't write. You don't call. You're starting to hurt my feelings. How did you get this number? I'll always know your number, Lubov, and where to find you. Wait. What do you want? Why are you bothering me, huh? I am honest citizen. And I'm the Easter Bunny. Dollhouse. Start hopping. No, no. I told you, I don't know any Dollhouse. Then find another honest citizen who does. Don't make me come find you. Hey, Ballard? We got a call. A couple kids found a house in the woods all made of candy and gingerbread. Thought that might be up your alley. Oh, my God, that's hilarious. Where'd this come from? Granny left it. Man, her teeth look big. Satellite re-task coming online. When? Uh... Anytime. Now-ish? We've got company. All right. Looks like we're there. No, I'm telling you, we're not there. We're somewhere over here. There is where we want to be. Here is not there. Excuse me. This area's restricted. There's no vehicles off the main road. Sorry, we're completely turned around. Do you mind pointing us in the right direction? What're you fellas doing way out here? Local news. We're shooting B-roll for a piece about the push to open up the area to more logging. You got some ID to go along with that story? Sure. Can't be too careful, Mr. Crehan. Being so far off the beaten tends to attract an unsavory element. No worries, Officer. We couldn't be more savory. Good to know. The new Samuelson. You're bigger than the last one. Topher. The man behind the gray-matter curtain. So, Alpha's one of your achievements. Yeah. Yeah. That was an anomaly. There's unpredictable remainders. We're still working out the kinkies. Like the blood, the screaming, the dying? Look at them. Bunch of helpless children. Did the ones Alpha slaughtered even put up a fight? They wouldn't know how. Not without an imprint. So, why not default them with ninja skills or whatever? We tried that once. And? Blood, screaming, dying. Alpha. I think I'd like to swim now. So, what do you think of your new girl? She's not a girl. She's not even a person, just an empty hat. Until you stuff a rabbit in it. Abracadabra. You getting this, mountain-man-friend? Yeah, I'm getting it. Okay, do you see these squigglies? These are the not-so-goods. What the hell's going on over there? Everything's fine. - You sure? - Yeah. Except for the gun pointed at my head. Boyd? Buddy! Boyd! He's a threat. Agent Ballard has been groping blindly for quite some time now. - He knows nothing. - I know his type. A guy like this, something gets under his skin, he's not gonna let it go until it's scratched out. And how would you suggest we handle this? Neutralize the risk before it becomes untenable. Authorize a kill order? On a federal agent? I think you overestimate his abilities. Even a blind dog can find a bone if he digs enough holes. All the appropriate measures are being taken. Thank you for your concern, Mr. Dominic. With respect, ma'am, I don't think that you fully... Hey, sorry. I think we have a situation. The kind you need to shoot at. Hello? Hello? Is there anybody out there? I need help, please, somebody! Hey, baby. Guess you found Ranger Bob, huh? Why are you doing this? 'Cause I want to know. Know what, you sick son of a bitch? If you deserve to live. If you've earned the right. You know what gives someone the right to live? Not hunting them! That's it! Shoulder to the wheel. Prove you're not just an echo. You want proof, you psycho? How about this? I'm gonna kill you. Will that prove it? I'm gonna stab you... You don't sound too good. Hey, you didn't drink from a canteen in there, did you? 'Cause that would be bad. Is it time for my treatment? Yes, but this is a very special one, Echo. This one won't pinch like the others you don't remember. Hello. You're tall. Do I have to be here for this? The Handler-Active imprint requires a direct line of sight. So, she needs to be looking into those dreamy brown eyes when I wave my magic wand. Then what? Me and Special Needs become buddy-buddy? Hey. This isn't about friendship, man. It's about trust. From this point on, Echo will always trust you without question or hesitation, no matter what the circumstance. You're about to become the most important person in her life. Let's just get this over with. Hey, hey, this is art. It's not an oil change. Rush the brushstrokes, you'll get a clown on black velvet. What's this? This is your script. Call and response. Neural lock and key. All right, Brando. Let's see what you got. - "Everything's going to be..." - Wait, wait, wait a second. Take her hand. What? Hold her hand. Tactile proximity enhances bonding protocol. It's... Okay. And Take 2. "Everything's going to be all right." Now that you're here. "Do you trust me?" With my life. How you feeling, sweetness? A little funky right about now? Don't worry. Stuff's not gonna kill you. The man I got it from said it would just put a spin on things. So what do you say? You spinning yet? Hey. Hey, wait. Wait. Hey! No, no, no, get that thing out of my face. How many? What? How many men between me and the girl? I don't know! I don't know. I swear to God! I don't think he's listening. A guy hired me over the phone! I never met him! I was just supposed to get you to stall the response team. And then put a bullet in my head. Hey, it's business. Don't take it personal, dude. I don't. Wake up. Wake up. You're doing great, baby. Don't quit on me now. Do you need a minute? 'Cause I don't want to rush you. All right. We'll rush. Hey, neighbor. Off early? Just swinging by for a bite, then getting back to it. Keeping our streets safe. I should thank you. You know, by thanking you. You want to have some lasagna? I have leftovers. You know, it's only leftovers if you've already eaten some, Mellie. Oh, no, I made another one that I... - It's really good. - Rain check? Totally. Yeah. Anytime, just knock. I'm always... Ooh! Pretty. Who's she? Nobody, according to the FBI database. No record of her. Is she in trouble? Maybe. Or just got caught up with the wrong people. Either way, I'll keep looking until I find her. Lucky girl. Wait. I'm not gonna hurt you. Do I know you? Everything's going to be all right. Now that you're here. Stay close. I'm gonna get you... Okay. I know he's not what people expect. Or what I expected. But I always go for the wrong guy, you know? - Yeah. - Looks. It's always about looks. I mean, we're bombarded with perfect teeth and hair and abs, and who cares what's underneath? But Jason... I wouldn't have looked twice at him. And then you get to know him, and... Okay, so he's heavy. He's not the guy from the magazines or the movies, but he's real. And I can't stop thinking about him. Can you wait for me? I want to see him after my treatment. I mean, I have to tell him what I'm feeling before I get too scared, or whatever it is people get when they... I need him to know what I'm thinking. I'll be here. You're the best. Hi. I'll be right back. - We have to stop. - No. You got shot with a freaking arrow. If we keep moving, you're gonna die. If Robin Hood catches up with us, we're both gonna die. How do I know you? We met a while back. I feel like I can trust you. - But I don't remember. - You're okay? There was something in the water. Richard put something in my water. He poisoned you? He said it wouldn't kill me, but I've been seeing things. What kind of things? A girl that looks like me, but isn't. Dead bodies in a shower, and... And a man standing over me, holding a knife, but I can't see his face. I don't think he has one. Are you here? Is this... Is this real? I'm here. And, yeah, this is real. He's gonna kill us. He's gonna find us and he's... Hey. Hey! Everything's gonna be all right. No, it isn't. Did you hear what I said? Everything's going to be... Everything's not gonna be all right. You don't get to live just because you deserve to. You have to prove it. You have to put your shoulder to the wheel. You want to speak English? I'm kind of bleeding to death here. He's not gonna stop. Unless he's dead. You can't go after this guy. You don't have the right imprint... You don't have the right training. - I'm a fast learner. - Jenny... Do you trust me? What? Do you trust me? With my life. You know how to use this? Four brothers. None of them Democrats. You should keep this. If Richard finds you, he'll... You didn't think I'd give you my only gun, did you? Didn't think it'd be that easy, did you? I'd be disappointed if it was. How's your buddy holding up? He's losing an awful lot of blood. Not as much as you're about to. What are you gonna do? You gonna throw rocks at me? No. I'm gonna shoot you with the gun my buddy gave me. You're playing my game now. Toss the bow and get on your knees, or I blow your freaking head off. My dad would have really liked you. I'm still gonna kill you... I just wanted to make a difference. Hey, baby. Little piece of advice. You don't want the Big Bad Wolf to find you, you should really turn off your walkie. Is this the best date ever, or what? Put it down. Or I put you down. Look at you. You can barely stand up. Probably wouldn't be able to hit me even if you did pull the trigger. You really want to find out? I admit I'm curious. Concerned. But curious. Then again, you shoot me and you get an arrow in that pretty little chest. How's that arm holding up? Maybe I'm not the one that's gonna miss. I'll tell you what. Why don't we ease up? We'll call it a draw. - You'll let me go? - Sure. No harm, no foul. You poisoned me and tried to shoot me with arrows. Okay, so maybe a little bit of harm. Look, how about this? On the count of three, we both back off. Deal? One... Two... Three. Get off of me! I try to be my best. That really hurt. Good. You said you were gonna kill me. It's a good thought. Follow through. He was right about you. You really are special. What are you talking about? Shoulder to the wheel, baby. Shoulder to the wheel. Fan out, go! To my left, go! Do you trust me? - Hey! - Prove you're not just an echo. Shoulder to the wheel. Did I fall asleep? For a little while. The background checks are supposed to prevent this sort of thing. How is it that you missed the fact that Connell is a psychopath? Because Richard Connell doesn't exist. Nothing in his jacket was real. His entire background, from birth to college to his referral here, all of it was fabricated. I've never seen anything this intricate. What about the man that Langton subdued in the van? Have you interrogated him yet? He was dead when we got there. But not from his run-in with Langton. That's not the way I left him. The GSWs were nonfatal. Painful, but you avoided the major arteries. That was the plan. What about these other wounds? Caused by a single non-serrated blade, approximately 10 centimeters in length. The lacerations are precise, almost surgical. I've seen this before. Alpha. That's impossible. Isn't that what we do here? - The impossible? - Alpha is dead. After he... After what he did, they tracked him down and put a bullet in his brain. And they'd never lie to us about something like that. Would they? Alpha could have killed Echo when he escaped, but he didn't. A wake of bodies, but he left her alive. Now someone hires some nut job to hunt her down in the woods. Maybe it was Alpha. Maybe not. Only thing I really know is, it all leads back to Echo. - Sorry. - Are you? Am I? Sorry. Are you really sorry? Awful lot of people seem to end up dead around you. How's it make you feel? Oh, right. You don't, unless we tell you how and what and when. I'm going to swim in the pool. If it were up to me, I'd put you in the Attic. Or the ground. Yeah, like talking to you is gonna make a difference. Yeah. There's nobody in there. Corrected & Synced by Bakugan
