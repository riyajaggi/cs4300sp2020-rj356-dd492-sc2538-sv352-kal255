 Previously on dollhouse... I've been many people. I can hear them. Sometimes suddenly. My name is November. The only reason mellie exists Is because of you. Remember our deal. The young lady's freedom has been granted. Just because you leave our care, We don't cast you to the wolves, madeline. I'm worried about you.

 There is nothing less than a conspiracy, Spearheaded by the rossum corporation. I'm sure he was looking for a cause. Someone gave him us. Prostitution? Human trafficking? Maybe murder. We're going to verify all this. We're going to find proof. We've got better than proof. We've got a name. There is nothing to worry about. Did security vet everyone? Metal detectors, hand wands, the occasional frisk...

 Occasional? Relax. The rossum corporation's evil, Not stupid. They're not going to try anything While the cameras are rolling. You really aren't nervous. Oh, I'm terrified. I'm about to put an innocent woman Up against one of the world's largest corporations, And I have no idea how they're going to react. Remind me why I love you so much. I'm your white knight. And I'm your beautiful damsel. Ever after. Ever after the press conference. Ten minutes late. Huh? Good afternoon. In the past weeks, I have made some serious charges. Charges of corporate malfeasance on the part Of several medical research companies. Charges which will receive a full airing on capitol hill This week when hearings begin. At those hearings, you will hear A most innocent word, A word which will take on a new and grim meaning. A word that will become synonymous With human trafficking, Prostitution And unconscionable abuses of neural technology, Directly traceable back to the rossum corporation. That word is "dollhouse." An urban myth that has become all too real. Where people have their memories erased and are brainwashed To do things that would appall the most cynical among us. Today, I want to put a face on this issue. I have a witness who lost three years Of her life to the dollhouse. She would like to make a brief statement. My name is madeline costley. Three years of my life are gone, stolen by the dollhouse. They preyed on me when I was at my weakest And forced me to... And forced me to do things. Things I never would have believed... ...Until senator perrin showed me evidence. I almost wish I hadn't seen it. But then I wouldn't be here. And there are still people being held captive by the dollhouse. They don't even know they need help. So, that means we have to help. What were you forced to do? We applaud miss costley's bravery, And we ask that you respect her privacy Throughout the inquiry process. Remind me why you released her from her contract Two years early. It was an internal matter. Right. Something to do with keeping you From exposing this house to the public. Well, that worked out. Something, obviously, has gone very wrong. But the protocol at this house cannot be blamed. There has been nothing in madeline's reintegration Into post-active life that would suggest... That she was about to go before a senate subcommittee And start naming names? I'm not questioning your protocol, adelle. It's your judgment that's become the issue here. There's some concern you may have developed A soft spot for this one. Like you did with nolan's girl. What was she called? Sierra? How would you like us to proceed? By doing nothing. Rossum already has a plan in place to deal with madeline. What the hell's that supposed to mean? Your house will be covered. May I ask how? It's handled. That's all you need to know. I'm already late for a satellite tour Where I get to run pr flack against this mess. Talk up rossum's good works, Our groundbreaking alzheimer's treatment... Rah, rah, rah. I'll be sure to watch. Oh, we'll all be watching. So just how much danger is she in? A former active once made a passing reference to us In his blog. That was his last entry. So going before the United States senate-- That would be worse. Considerably. We can't just sit by and let this happen. I have no intention of just sitting by. He told you to do nothing. Indeed, he did not. I inquired how he would wanted us to proceed, And given the context, I would call his response a suggestion. You framed it before he could tell you what to do. Madeline will not be testifying In front of any senate subcommittee. She was quite happy when she left us. Now she's not. She's being used. You have developed a soft spot. You miss my point. She's being used against me. Someone with inside knowledge has served her up To this crusading junior senator. So, what's your next move? To discover what game is being played. Daniel perrin. Political family. Third in his line to become a United States senator. Stared policing medical research just under three years ago. No one is saying the work these corporations do isn't vital, But there must be accountability. The health of our citizens cannot be held hostage To a profit motive. He's a demagogue. Look at him. So concerned about the public. And when he shuts down all research, We can go back to leeches. So why isn't rossum worried? Maybe they've got dirt on him. They would have used it by now. November is sad. I almost wish I hadn't seen it, But then I wouldn't be here. Yes. Yes, she is. We should help her. That's just what we're going to do. She's not right. Yeah. We got that the first time, echo. She doesn't mean madeline. Only that it took that long. I was sure the moment I laid eyes him. I couldn't let her get away. She's perfect. It's like they made her just for me. Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com She's perfect. It's like they made her just for me. He's not lying. At first glance, she's perfect. At second glance, she's still perfect. Skip to the part where she's not. You look hard enough, you start to see discrepancies. Her parents' social security numbers Don't match with their names. Her college transcript weighted her gpa Even though berkley doesn't calculate them like that. Forgeries. Some of the best I've seen. Cindy perrin is a doll. Harding was being modest when he said rossum had a plan in place. They've been married for three years. Long-term placement. She clearly wasn't imprinted to dissuade him From going after rossum. She's a sleeper. An assassin, you mean? Mm. Like madeline When she was mellie? Oh, please. She didn't kill you. Mrs. Perrin's Going to be activated when things get too hot. I'd say things are warmish. Even harding's too smart to murder a sitting u.S. Senator. But he wouldn't think twice About having a sleeper assassin take out madeline. It won't come to that. You're going to stop her before she gets to madeline. Senator perrin moved them both to a safe house By a security firm called contratech. Where's perrin? His senate team is still working out of the downtown hotel Where they held their press conference-- The commerce plaza. He's still there. So tell me about this safe house. Ten minutes from downtown. Quiet, residential neighborhood. The house is covered with surveillance. I'm working on getting access to contratech's servers. Just give me the address. I'll go get madeline. It will be a touch more difficult Than playing cat burglar, Especially if cindy perrin is there. You'll need to understand what it is you'll be up against. That's my apartment. Mellie. Once a sleeper active's protocol has been triggered, The thing you're facing Will be neither reasoned with nor stopped. Leave a message. Adelle : There are three flowers in a vase. The third flower is green. I get the idea. Madeline easily dispensed with a man twice her size. Cindy perrin will be no less capable. Any sympathy for mr. Hearn would be misplaced. He was a serial rapist. I wasn't thinking about him. Last time I was at the dollhouse... ...He seemed so kind and... Gentle. You can never tell what monsters people are hiding inside. Like me? Why would you say that? I killed someone. For the rest of my life... ...I'm going to know that I killed someone. You didn't do this. The dollhouse did. And that's why you're going to testify against them. Hello. How are the two most important ladies in my life? You're sweet, daniel. But I can't talk. Madeline's having a rough time. Go, take care of her. I'm going to stay here at the hotel And go over the financials with burt, if you need me. Remind me why I love you so much. I'm your white knight. And I'm your beautiful damsel. Ever after. What is it? It's the thing that if it doesn't work Exactly like it should, won't get me in trouble. I call it a disrupter. That's not too star trek, is it? T.O.S.? Hmm? It's based off what I could deconstruct From alpha's remote wipe tech. This is the same tech That turned echo into a serial killer? We said we wouldn't dwell on that. He's dwelling. Just continue. You push this button, And it sends a neuro-electric feedback loop Through the biolinks implant, Disrupting the cranial architecture. If the frequency is calibrated to match-- Topher, less tell, more show. Mm-hmm. Hello, kilo. Is it time for my treatment? Isn't she so cute and tiny? I love it when a doll's name is so on the nose. Because she weighs one kilo. It's a unit of measurement. I'm so alone. I enjoy my treatments. Yes, we know. But you probably won't enjoy this. The gentle hum lets you know it's working. Side effects include: Headache, bloody nose And the uncontrollable urge to... That. It'll knock out any doll in a ten-foot radius, Including a pesky sleeper like cindy, Without actually harming real people like us. Uh, make that a 50-foot radius. Good. So I'll drop mrs. Perrin and I'll pick up madeline. What? You're more right than you know. If madeline is in range, it will bring her down as well. I thought it only worked on dolls. It would affect anyone with active architecture. But you released her. Why would she still have your "architecture" in her head? No one ever really leaves here, do they? Echo, it's time for a treatment. Do I get to help November? If he makes me someone else, I won't be able to help her. That's okay. The person topher's going to make you is going to help us. Her handler's not going to be too happy When he learns you sent her out without him. Mr. Ballard is unhappy about a great many things at the moment. His complete focus needs to be on madeline's retrieval. You sure you don't want me to cover her engagement? I need you on point in operations. Echo will be fine. Any qualified interim handler will do. I'll send edwards. Fine. Just tell him not to nod off. Echo's going to be doing most of the "handling" on this one. Mm-hmm. Try the transit limited account-- The one that paid out to madeline. See if we can run a trace on it again. Maybe it'll link back to a rossum subsidiary. You know what, burt, it's getting late. Let's finish this in the morning. Wake up, mr. Senator. I want to make sure I get your good side. Trust me, you've got nothing to be embarrassed about. What the hell-- who the hell are you?! Oh, you forgot me already? I'm hurt. I'm bree. I don't know you! I've never seen you in my life! Mm, hate to disagree with you, senator, But you've seen all of me. I can show you the instant replay if you'd like. I blacked out. You had to have drugged me. Should we order some champagne? I think we should order some champagne. We'll just bill it to the taxpayers, right? Stop it! Shut up. I just-- I have to think. Fine, testy. I'll leave, then. Okay. I sent the really good stuff to my employers before you woke up. I just stuck around Because I've got a message for you first. Rossum sent you. I just go where I'm told; I don't get names. The message is-- Back off. Okay. So, thanks for the fun times. I'll get out of your hair. Oh. Nice. I like it a little rough. Just don't touch the face. My god. Or I could tie you up. It's amazing. So real. Uh, duh. You're a doll. Thanks. You're cute, too. Rossum would never risk hiring a call girl. Not when they can programs someone instead. Whose memory they can erase when they're done. Wow. They didn't tell me you were extra crazy. I typically charge more for that. You're a doll. You're not real. Dude, maybe you should Take a nap-- sleep this off. We're leaving. Where are we going? To see my wife. You're twisted. I like that a lot. Threesomes are extra, But I might just give you a freebie, senator. Langton. I have eyes I need you to take out. It's gonna take a second. Uploading malware now. Got it. You're clear to move. Try to understand what I'm saying. You are not you. This place-- this dollhouse-- has altered you, Brainwashed you. They've turned you into someone else. I know it's a lot to absorb. I don't mean to upset you. So is this some sort of fantasy scenario? Because I don't get it. When do we get naked again? Listen to me. You've been manipulated. You were probably desperate and alone, And they used that against you. Forced you to be a slave So the wealthy can have a play toy. It's despicable. I'll prove it to you. What is your mother's name? Denise. Where were you born? What is your birthday? Duluth. August 6th. I have two brothers. I tried to be a dancer in new york, But I made more money as an escort. Do you really want to know my life story? The programming is so detailed. Of course it is. Look, you're very sweet, But you should know-- I like what I do. You're not the first john Who thinks he can save me. But I can save you. I can save all of you. If I don't stop rossum, no one will. You're a real hero, aren't you? I just want to do what's right. Senator, no offense, But if you want to do the right thing, Bringing your hooker mistress to your wife Probably isn't a great idea. Just saying. Cindy knows the top neurologists in the country. She can help you. And... I need you. You're evidence. Sounds like overtime to me. Madeline, listen to me. Listen to me. These people are not who you think they are. Okay, they are tricking you. Do you trust me? Good. We have to get out of here. Let go of me! I'm not going to hurt you. I know exactly what you did to me! Get away from her! Right now. Don't come any closer. You need my help just as much as she does. You're not a doll. This is new. What the hell was that? It's echo. I don't get it. Is she anywhere near ballard? Why would she be anywhere near ballard? Because her neural architecture is cascading, Which means she just got zapped with the disrupter. According to her gps signal, she's at that safe house. Inform her temporary handler he needn't return. Bring up the security feed. Okay, so either they just got into a fistfight, In which case, "go, echo, " or... Senator perrin is the doll. We've been chasing the wrong person. That would make cindy... Perrin's handler. Get ballard on the phone. Warn him. Harding made a senator. And sicced him on the dollhouse. That makes sense how? Oh, I don't know. Unless he's trying to sabotage this house specifically. No answer. um, guys? Echo just kidnapped the conspiracy. Where are you taking me? I don't know. Anywhere else. As long as there's a big fat aspirin. Go back. We have to go back. My wife is back there. No way. Nothing's turning me around. Bree! Everything you said is true. Slow down. There are... Gaps. Things that aren't filled in. I can see other people-- Other lives-- through them. You're going to get us killed. It's like I can see the seams. How it's all constructed. I'm not real. I'm not who I think am. I am a doll. Make sure you get her on an earlier flight. I'll meet you at the airport as soon as I talk to the police. Paul ballard. La dollhouse's latest idiot hire. Dewitt had explicit instructions to leave this alone. I think it was more of a suggestion. Who are you? I'm mrs. Cynthia perrin. You're not a doll. Because this didn't work on me? What the hell is this? But you are a dollhouse... Doesn't matter. We have our own experts. We'll figure it out. Pack this with my luggage. The black case. It's got to get through airport security. Better they don't see it. So why does rossum want one of their ex-actives To testify against them? Wait until I leave, Then make sure he ends up face-down In the l.A. River. I'm going to go find perrin. Meet you at the airport. Do not miss the flight. I know you're scared, but we cannot keep running like this. Okay. You said you can help me. How are you going to help me? Oh, god. Stop the car! Where are you going? Nowhere. Everywhere. I need to get away from it. How can I get away from it? I don't think you can. I think you're a doll. Like me. No. I know who I am. I know who I am! Please tell me I know who I am. I think I know who he is. Yes? He's senator daniel perrin. So he's not a doll? He's senator daniel perrin, and he's a doll. He's a doll version of himself. His family's political dynasty goes back generations. Congressmen, senators, Even a great uncle who was governor of vermont. But perrin himself was a party-boy screw-up, Well into his mid-30s. Before he washed out at yale, He was voted most likely To wake up in a pool of his own sick. He was selected for his pedigree. But his ambition? Somebody else gave that to him. Dewitt. Would you be open to a bribe? No. Get up. You're gonna miss your flight. They stopped moving. Does that mean they've been captured? I don't know. But I think the team I sent to intercept them has. What? I had a retrieval team en route, But they stopped here, And they're not responding. That's the cover number. That'd be bree calling in to her escort agency. Hello? What did you do to him? Bree? Yeah. Bree. I guess that's who I am now. Mostly. Bree, is the senator with you? If he is a senator. Right now, he just locks like a basket case. You did this to him. No, but I can help him. I think I believe you. Of course you do. That's why you called. A treatment? Yes. Yes, a treatment. It will make him feel better. No. No "treatment." I know what that means. I know everything about you people. Senator perrin? Yes, I am senator perrin. Daniel perrin. I am not a doll. No, you're not. Strictly speaking. You were born daniel perrin, But the man you are today is part-manufactured. Your mind has been altered. Tampered with. What are you talking about? Someone is controlling you. I can help you find out who And to what purpose. Why should I believe anything you say? Because I am the person who programmed bree To blackmail you. If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead already. Hey. You don't want me dead. Wow. I feel like we're really bonding. Let's discuss bonding, shall we? Let's discuss your wife. Senator? It's her, isn't it? Daniel! She's not right. We should go. Now. Where have you been? Who is that woman? What? No, cindy... Daniel! I don't even care what this means. We were never here. I never saw her. Let's just go. Yeah, let's do that. Let's just go. Get away from me. Cin, I don't know what's happening to me. It's okay, baby. It's okay. We'll figure it out. Remind me why I love you so much. I'm your white knight. And I'm your beautiful damsel. Ever after. Ever after. That it? Oh, god... Daniel? It's all a lie. I'm not going with you. Take me to the dollhouse. No chance. You won't shoot me. You're my handler. That's true. But I'm not hers. You won't shoot her. That's not who you are. Put the gun down. Don't come any closer, daniel. Please, come closer. Cindy! What the hell are you doing? She's not going to remember and neither are you. We're going back to d.C., So you can forget any of this ever happened. Daniel. You wouldn't. You couldn't. Not your beautiful damsel. You love me. That's it. Put it down. Now, we have to go. You just woke up a lot of people. And they all think you're a bitch. She hit me, daniel. You're not my wife. Cindy, don't! No! Daniel! I'm on your team! I love her. I know. But I don't have that problem. Sorry about that. Come on. I think I know where you can get some help. You want to take me to them? They're all bad guys, bree. I think her bad guys are badder than my bad guys. Hey, she's not your wife. Come on. Hey, madeline. Right on time. Okay, call airport security now. No. Madeline. No. If I can't face him, how can I stand up To a multibillion dollar corporation? We've got to get you out of here. Who was I? Who was I that made you so obsessed with me? Now's not the time. It's the only chance you get. Her name was mellie. She was my neighbor. I was fbi, and she was helping me With my investigation. That was the fantasy? I was your girl Friday Who you slept with the other six days of the week? It wasn't a fantasy. I was fbi. And I didn't know mellie was a doll. The dollhouse tricked me, too. So that made you want to work for them? It was part of a deal I made with them to get you out. I agree to work for them, they free you. So I should be thanking you? I want them to fall just as hard as you do. Let me testify. They want you to testify against them. It's a trick. Mellie, if you do this, it would be a mistake. I'm not mellie. I know that. You said you freed me. When someone's free, they get to make mistakes. Am I free? Echo's vitals and gps gone. How is that possible? It's not. It shouldn't be. Someone just did something They definitely shouldn't be able to do. Mr. Langton? Echo's gone. Senator perrin, too. Call mr. Ballard before you return to the house. Perhaps he had more luck with madeline. Still no word from ballard. Madeline is no doubt halfway across the continent On her way to testify In front the senate subcommittee on ethical neuroscience. Why would harding hang us out to dry like that? If we fall, half of rossum comes down with us. With perrin under his power, Harding controls how far the damage goes. The senate committee will clear rossum of any contact with us. And perrin will be hailed as the conquering hero Who's rescued all these poor souls. He'll have the political capital To pass whatever laws and regulations Rossum programmed him to. They'll be unstoppable. Yes, they will. So what do we do? Stop them. Thank you, grace. How soon till the senator gets here? They said any minute. Athena's diagnostic can wait. I want a clear runway. Daniel perrin's our bright star. Apparently, they're bringing in the l.A. Active That kidnapped him, too. Yes, well, we'll have a look at her Once the senator's squared away. It's confirmed she's from l.A., right? Why would they move against us? Keep your mind on your work, please. The moment you start wondering About the people upstairs, They'll start wondering about you. That isn't a thing you want. Sorry. Curiosity. It's perfectly natural. We have urges, And we are in the business of urges, so why not indulge? How many sugars? Two-and-a-half. But we can't. We never can-- indulge. We have a sacred trust. We have the privilege of living inside the human heart, For which we give up everything. We give up everything. This is bennett. Yes, sir. It won't be a problem. As soon as I get senator perrin's body. I assumed we'd fill him with travel memories-- A layover in milwaukee, some turbulence-- And something to explain any dehydration or disorientation. Bad shrimp or... Or a film with a dog. If you could please just make sure that no one touches him. Do we have any information about the other active, the woman? Might be useful to scan her, See if we can lock down her parameters. It might give an indication... I'll report as soon as I can. They're coming down. Hades comes in at 6:00 After a long-term with the closeted councilman. Just keep him in holding. And cancel aphrodite. Why is hades still on the table? It should have been... It should. Should. Not was. Is. Condition contrary to fact: Should. Contrary to fact. Like a lie. Should. Should. Here we are. Is he unconscious? I can't work him if he's unconscious. Prep the mask, recompile the perrin imprint And spool up the memory buffers. And the second active? Put her in first. I'll look at her for a bit While the senator comes to. Spool his buffers and table them, keep him in holding. And then, You know what, you can go. I need to focus. I can help you with the second active. I have to focus, please! Thank you. I need this... To focus on this. Thank you. Bennett, another migraine? All in my head. Your problems are all external. More things to explain in perrin's imprint. What should we go with? Mugging? Tumble down the stairs? How about he beats his wife? The senator doesn't beat his wife. The senator loves his wife. Lucky wife. I brought you a souvenir. The tech that fried him. Binaural transmitter. Solid state capacitors. Nanoscale solders. I know this hand. This is topher brink. I've always wanted to meet his tech. Don't. Unless you want to drop every doll in the house. My, my, my. How do you work? The hearing starts in ten hours. If perrin's not there, the plan is blown, And we're demoted to being dead. The other active's slabbed. This one's semiconscious. Not a threat, but you should be able to work soon. His call and response stopped working. I'm going to have to rebuild the cr10 relays to the amygdala. A fun time for me. We'll see how much cognitive damage the imprint sustained. Get away from me. Get away! Yes, it's going to be a full overwrite. Please, don't erase me! Please don't! I don't want to forget. Please... It's my mind. Not for some time now. Oh, god. Who are you? She's god, honey. And you've heartily offended her. Don't you need to make sure That l.A. Hasn't tracked them here? We left clean. Will you please make sure? Will you please make sure? Will you please make sure? It's going to be all right. Better than all right. This is sick. You are sick. Who's to say? We'll start working in just a moment. Where am I? Caroline... You always promised you'd come back to me. Let's play. : No! No! Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com
