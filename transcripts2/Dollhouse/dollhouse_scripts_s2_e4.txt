 Dollhouse (2009â€“2010): Season 2, Episode 4 - Belonging - full transcript 
 Sierra's past connection to the Rossum Corporation is revealed. Nolan, a Rossum doctor, threatens DeWitt unless she gives him an imprinted Sierra permanently. It is revealed that Nolan was in love with Sierra in her life as Priya Tsetsang (before she joined the Dollhouse), but she rejected him completely from the beginning. Nolan has her kidnapped and put in a Rossum institution, where he uses medications to force her into insanity. As part of Nolan's plan, Topher is sent to the institution to bring Priya to the Doll House and make her an Active. In the present, Topher discovers the truth after a clue from Echo, and, feeling pangs of guilt about handing Sierra over to Nolan, imprints her instead with Priya's original personality, and she confronts Nolan at his house. Meanwhile, Boyd takes notice of Echo's growing self-awareness when he discovers a book in her sleeping pod and he slips her a security pass in preparation for when "the storm" comes.

 I was just trying to help her. I was just trying to help her. Thanks for covering, Priya. Oh, I sold a necklace for you. A talkative young man brought one for his fiance. No kidding. I should have you sell my junk for me all day. Ah, your jewelery sells itself. Oh, the Aussie princess can't hurt. Hey, do they have royalty in Australia? Uh, we have a queen,

 yes, but it's the same one they have in England. Fickle bitch. Oh, speaking of princes... ...He's back. Not my type. Why not? You're certainly his. So, uh, What are you doing with all these pieces anyway? Not using them for firewood, I hope. I'm a collector, and you're the real deal. You shouldn't be selling on Venice Beach with all this novelty crap.

 Well, I need cash, and I don't have a work visa. So... Would you ever be interested in, uh, making something for me? Something very large? Like an elephant? No. Well, like a painting, a big painting that would cost a lot more money. Oh... You're loaded, too. I'm, uh, I'm overpaid. Well, did you have something specific you would want? Yes. You. To do your thing. You know, maybe I could even arrange a show. All right, so... here. Let me know. Ooh... See, you hit the jackpot, girl. And Nolan commissioned this? Because I don't think I have reason to live if I can't have one of your paintings for myself. Wow, you must have a really boring life. Oh, you're funny. She's funny, too, Anton. There she is-- The woman of the hour. Man, Nolan wasn't kidding. About what? Well, he said the art was almost as beautiful as the artist. Yeah, Nolan likes to say things like that. I'm not as good as these people tell me. How good you are is history's business. You're doing what you love and these folks want to pay you for it. These aren't really my kind of folks. I plan to be moving on. Well, a few showings like this and you can move on... and on, anywhere you want. You should stick with Nolan. He finds an artist, they thrive. This is an elaborate, expensive seduction, Nolan. I mean, uh, it's the least Rossum can do after all of your work with us, But couldn't you just buy her a necklace or a boat or something? I tried all that, but she's an artist. A free spirit, harding. - She can't be bought. - Ah. But she can be lured. We'll see. Just... Why don't you let us build the woman you want-- The perfect woman? We have all types available. I don't want a doll, Harding. I want her. He's crazy about your work. It's not all about the work. No, sweetie, it's about the power. There's a ton of money in this room, but that's not power. Nolan's a medical genius, short-listed for the Nobel. That's power. Art is power Because they can't make it. So what if you make Nolan all cute and nervous? Why not ride that a little? Let them think they have the power. Our time will come. Sorry, darling. Luca is chomping at the bit. Priya, this is Luca Pallidio, The finest art dealer in all of Italy. Not true. Buona sera. Oh, hello. I love the piece. It's very organic, um, effortless. You mind if I ask you many boring questions? Not at all. Mr. Harding, always a pleasure. Most people who are as rich and good-looking as Nolan Don't have good taste. But your work reminds me of Bernard Patin. Is he an influence? Uh, I'm embarrassed to say I don't know who that is. Is that bad? Well, no, it's natural. People kill for that-- to be unaffected. Hmm. Unlike everyone here. So why the bird motif? I don't know. I just think they're beautiful. That's it. Perhaps it is a reflection of you, no? Free, always moving, searching for something... better? I don't need better. No, you move because... because there is wind. Do you want to get out of here? I'd love to. Okay. We can talk some more about Nolan. Sneaking out? I was just looking for you to say good-bye. Why are you so eager to leave? I mean, everyone is here to adore you. Enjoy the painting, Nolan. Come on, come on. Stay a little longer, Priya. The painting is yours. My job here is done. - I'm going now. - Why? So you can give it up to some guy you just met? He's not even real. Hey... - What? - Would you like a treatment? You were supposed to help me. Oh, you don't need my help. You are like the bull-- strong, yet with the horns, fierce. - Wait... - Ciao. After my treatment, I find you. Ciao, ciao. Good-bye. I've pulled out all the stops. I mean, this is our big night. - We've, we've, we've... - No, - This isn't our night. - ...We've planned for this. There's no we. No, look, I have-- I've offered you everything. What else do you want? I want to walk out the damn door. Hey. What did you expect, huh? Day after day, just dangling it in front of my face, seducing me. Seducing? You're crazy, Nolan. It's all in your head. Get off me! I'm sorry. I'm not going to take no for an answer. All right, I'll do anything. Stop it! You disgust me. Nothing in this world could ever make me love you. Hmm... When can I see you again? I don't know. Soon. Wait, wait. To remember you. I love you. Sync by honeybunny www.addic7ed.com I like your bird. Thank you. I don't like this color, though. Why do you use it? It's always here. Ah, it should work. Well, it doesn't work. It works in theory. Alpha got it to work, through a phone nonetheless. Are you comparing my intelligence to alpha's? Well... You're talking to yourself like he does. That's a... very good point. What's good? Mother ship! Oh... You got to stop doing that or I'll make you wear a bell. Aw... You shouldn't have. Sierra made it. That's very thoughtful of you, but I don't think there's room on my fridge. Aw. Aah! You're like a ninja. Sierra hates the bad man. Who's the bad man? It's not like the others. He makes her sad over and over. Well, it's a... Fairly primitive rendition. I'm not sure if this is a man, let alone which one. Hmm. You're not looking hard enough. You never do. What's the word on this repeat client Sierra has been seeing? Why? Something's bothering me about it. I have a hunch something's wrong. That's funny-- that I have a hunch? That it's bothering you. Nolan Kennard. Big-time Rossum VIP, MD, Ph.D. in molecular pharmacology. Wrote his dissertation on neuroleptics. Works a lot with sick kids. You want me To make this profile available to you on the system? What about the engagements? You design them. Tame. Your typical romance or seduction scenarios. Sierra's stress levels never go higher than a 1.3. Always comes back with a clean bill of health. I helped Sierra, you know. She was a paranoid schizophrenic when she came here-- Psychotic-- and I helped her. I didn't ask. Is that where your hunch came from? Yeah. It's Sierra's. Echo brought it to me. She was going on about a bad man. He's the blotch here, is what I'm getting. Echo brought it you. She's always been mother hen about Sierra. Should look into that. I am! And so far, Echo's given me way more than you have. I need a connection, a pattern. Saunders. Saunders? She's gone, Boyd. You got to stop mooning. Saunders didn't work engagements. She looked after the actives here. She would have seen. Seen what? A pattern. "Dark shape always present. Must be something from her past?" Question mark. "I can only conclude that, "if the dark shapes don't symbolize Sierra's "state of mind before intake, "they must represent an extreme sense of anxiety and rage associated with..." I'm not the bad man. Sierra doesn't like this color. You should take them all. Is this wrong? No. It's good. You're taking charge. You're taking matters into your own hands. They're in my shirt. What are you up to, girl? Huh. Echo was right. I wasn't looking hard enough. - What? - Neuroleptics. He's an expert. You mean Kennard. Neuroleptics are antipsychotics, right? Like haloperidol or good-old chlorpromazine. Most of them block D2 receptors in the dopamine pathways of the brain. I'll take your word for it. Look, uh, this is a brain. Normal, boring brain, like your brain. This... is a brain on drugs. Or more specifically, antipsychotic medication. You see the inhibited mesolimbic pathway? Hmm? The partially blocked serotonin receptors? And this is Priya's original scan. It's similar, right? But why the five-HT efflux in the striatum? And looking closer... Increased conduction of chloride ions. They're at odds. You lost me at brain. Priya wasn't psychotic despite her heavy medication. She was psychotic because of it. And... That's not all. When Saunders conducted that wish fulfillment exercise a few months back, you said that Sierra went to the mental health clinic to confront the doctor who diagnosed her? Dr. Makido. Wrong. Sierra went to confront Nolan. Nolan Kennard owns that clinic. He owns the whole complex, and he has a penthouse office there. Sierra went to see him. How did this get by Dewitt? We got to tell her. She's gonna flip her biscuits. Unless... You don't think she already knows? She does now. Thank you so much for coming in, Dr. Kennard. Oh, no, I'd-I'd been meaning to schedule another appointment anyway. Yeah, it seems the, uh... the moment you take her away, I'm ready to have her back. No doubt. And no doubt that's why you've asked me here-- To, uh, caution me yet again about your policy on repeat engagements, right? In a way. You know I'm not interested in any of your other actives? Oh, that's a non-issue. I would no sooner allow you near one of our other actives than I would a mad dog near a child. I beg your pardon? Given that you're a raping scumbag one tick shy of a murderer. I can't recall. Do you take sugar? All right. Um... What the hell's going on here, Adelle? Oh, there's nothing going on. In fact, it's finished. We will no longer be providing you with our services. You have made me an accomplice in something vile, Dr. Kennard. And it ends now. Does it? - Yes, it does. - What are you gonna do, Adelle? Go to the police? Not really in a position to do that, are you? I am, However, in a position to see to it that you never lay a hand on that woman ever again, and that is exactly what I intend to do. You know what? I think you're right about this, uh, repeat engagement thing. It's not a good idea, so let's, uh, Stop dancing around your policy, all right? You're going to imprint her, and you're going to send her to me. - Forever. - Excuse me? You do it by the end of business today, I'll see to it you keep your job. Thanks for the tea. I can't believe what you're asking me to do! The girl was a basket case, Adelle-- hearing voices, drooling in her soup-- you saw yourself. - Because he made her that way. - Adelle, We're being asked to place this young woman into a life of wealth and privilege, Married to a man she adores. Do you really want to go to Rossum with this? And accuse one of their most valued assets of being a kidnapper and rapist? That is what he is. And if we do this, what does it make us? What are we already? We are not slave merchants. Mr. Harding, I won't do this. However she got here, she's here. In my house, and therefore, in my care. Yes, and you would never let anyone take advantage of any of your charges, would you, hmm, Miss Lonely Hearts? Whatever indiscretions I may be guilty of... Oh, forget Victor. We don't care. Everyone likes to take a little something home from the office once in a while. But he's the least of your indiscretions. I think we both know that. If feeling that you're somehow decent and moral helps you get through your day, that's your business. This house, however, is our business. And you will run it the way we tell you to, or we'll find someone who will. And I promise-- You wouldn't like the early retirement plan. Imprint the girl, send her to him, close the account. Victor. What are you doing? Now you don't have to use this color anymore. You look like an Indian chief. I am an Indian chief. Hurry, sergeant, orders! What do we do?! I don't want to take charge. I don't want to take charge. Come here. You can't let them do this. They're not going to do it. We are. And when I say we don't have a choice, know that I mean it. Aren't we supposed to care for these people? Dr. Saunders would never have allowed... Which Saunders would that be? The avuncular physician so brutally cut down not five feet from where you were standing? Or the last woman to whom you gave a permanent imprint? The other wounded flower you restored by offering her a new life? Who apparently found you so unbearable, she had to flee the city. Is it that one? How can you expect me to do this? You'll do it because you must. The cold reality is that everyone here was chosen because their morals have been compromised in some way. Everyone... except you. You, Topher, were chosen because you have no morals. You have always thought of people as playthings. This is not a judgment. You always take very good care of your toys. But you're simply going to have to let this one go. Sierra? It's time for your treatment. All right. Victor, would you like to come with me? I'd like to, yes. No, no, no. Victor can't come with you. Why not? He just can't, okay? Okay, I'm sorry. I'll wait for you right here. So she can remember. This is Boyd. Topher is having problems following commands. Please make sure he follows this one. So I don't have to resort to drastic measures. What's the order? The order is to keep the dolls in their place. Topher, have you completed your report on Sierra's last engagement? Oh, you mean her last engagement ever? - How about a verbal report? - Hearn's an idiot. Thanks for the treatment, Shaggy. No problem, "I can't remember your name today." I would like to report Hearn called me a nerd. Is he a fourth grader? We may have found our replacement Sierra. 22-year-old female. I think you might be interested in this one. Let me guess, a little bit hot? Mental health case. A paranoid schizophrenic. Cool! Vivid auditory hallucinations, paranoid delusions. She's all over the place, usually incoherent. We've been working with a specialist in neuroleptics and he's in there right now. He's been giving her daily treatments, But none seem to take. Poor thing. I think, uh, she'll be sedate enough for evaluations. Thanks again, Dr. Kennard. Certainly. This way. Priya? Priya, this is Dr. Brink. He's going to ask you a few questions. No! No, no. Stream of bodies, just more and more bodies. More bodies, more and more bodies gushing through the river. Just more and more bodies. Priya, my name is Topher Brink. No. How could he get answers when every word in here is a lie? Every word is a lie! Everyone's a liar, he's a liar! - He's a liar! - I'm not a liar. He's a liar; he's a liar. He's a liar. I'm not a liar. Priya. Don't call me that! They're dissolving me. From the in, the inside out. Do you know where you are? I'm in hell. You're in Los Angeles. I can understand the mix-up. You are in a medical facility. No, no! Would you like to leave this place? Yes. Yes! Help me. Help me, please. Shh! There are men with guns and they took me here to fill me with poison. They're filling me with poison to make me crazy. It's not uncommon to believe that. They're torturing me! They're torturing, they're torturing me. I'm a prisoner, I'm a prisoner. Not for long. * Sun rises slow * * Water rides the air * * Gathering in the clouds * * Forming raindrops or heavy snow * * We're drones, happy as we are * * Thinking our sustained lies are love * * The flow, tearing us apart * You're here to stay? I have you to myself? I'm all yours. Is it done then? Yes. Good. If you say so. If you have actually managed to develop some pangs of conscience, you may rest in the knowledge that in this matter, you... You had no choice. No, I didn't. Will it still be romantic if we build up an appetite first? Am I being too aggressive? Did you want me wide-eyed and demure? Or stupid? Did you want me to be a mute? Which is it, Nolan? Which fantasy did you want to keep forever? Priya? You just couldn't take no for an answer. Are you looking for this? This a bookmark? It's a leaf. It's pretty. Is the book pretty? There aren't any pictures. I can make out some of the words. It's fun. Exercising our brains makes us our best. Echo, when did you learn how to lie? Am I in trouble? Not from me. But there are people who would be very upset if they knew what you were doing. Reading? You brought the painting to Topher. You're pushing. The actives, the staff... What you're doing could have consequences you can't predict or control. Some people are not ready to wake up. I don't care. Something bad is coming-- Like a storm-- And I want everyone to survive it. They need to wake up. Echo, you stir things up, you might bring the storm on yourself. I'm not your lab rat anymore, Nolan. I'm free, clear-headed, it feels good. What, and you, uh, came to get revenge for a year of loving every minute of it? Did I love it? Must not have been very memorable. I remember you poisoning me, Locking me up, but I have not a single memory of the year where I apparently liked you. Oh, we had some good times. Mmm, I got filled in on all the details. Brainwashing. Talk about desperate. You know, they even programmed me To think it was endearing how quick you were. You were mine. I'm sorry. I don't think I was faithful to you. Yeah, I let them whore you out to anyone. No, it's something else. It's someone, uh, someone I trust. - He helps me. - See? He thrills me! Yeah, I know, see, it worked. You told me that you loved me a hundred times. I changed you. No, it's not you. I managed to fall for someone else. You think this is cute? It's absurd. I don't remember meeting him or even spending a moment with him. But I can feel it stronger than anything. I'm crazy about him! I love him. I love him so much more than I hate you. Are you gonna fight fair this time? So much for fair, huh? You know... This is a scenario I never thought of. You resisting. The struggle is a turn on. Priya? Priya? Priya. Priya. Priya. Hey. Priya. Priya. Priya. We got to run. We got to run. We got to-- we got to get out of here. We got to go. Got to run before... How did you... I'm head of security. I hear every call. Priya. I want you to wash your hands and go to Nolan's room. Pack a suitcase of his clothes. Pack for warm weather. Topher. In the van outside, you'll find containers of sulphuric acid, a plastic sheet, and a bag of tools. What? - What are you talking about? - Consequences. Come on, Topher. Boyd. I can't do it. You're a doctor. You know how to dissect a body. That was in school. And why do you? Slit the femoral arteries and pump the chest; draining the fluids makes it easier to cut up. I was just trying to help her. Now she's ruined. You had a moral dilemma. Your first. And it didn't go well. Priya does not belong in the Dollhouse. She does now. Now, I have to start the lies. Hey, man, it's me. Yeah, it's been a while. Look, I'm going to need the goose. Is he around? Yeah, I need someone... Disappeared. It seems his permanent engagement plan involved leaving the country with Sierra. Did any heat come down from up top? Not that I know of. Anything at your end? Nothing here. But he left without her. In a hurry. We found his car just south of the border, with some fake ident in the glove box. So, Sierra's back in the house? Never even got to say good-bye. How convenient. Are you going to look into it further? I don't think any good would come of it. I don't know what's real. Yesterday, I had lost my mind, trapped in a nightmare. Then... Then you bring me here, wake me up, and I'm sane again. But you tell me it's been a year. All the things I was made to do. And I kill a man. I... I woke up from a nightmare only to live in one. You were supposed to help me. I thought I was. I was... fooled. I'm so sorry. If there was anything I could do to make it better... Do you have any beer? Am I allowed to have beer in here? Or is this my last one? No. You're allowed. On, uh, special occasions. And are we happy here? I... You-- Most of you... I have no idea. That's him. What's his name? Victor. I love him. Is that real? Yes. Yes, it's real. He loves you back. I wished Nolan dead, I did. I thought about it all the time when I was locked up in that horrible place going crazy. I... I never should've let you go there. I should've just set you free. I would've gone anyway. I wanted to confront him. I don't know what I thought would happen. If you wake me up again, put me back to where I was a year ago. Skip this day. Ignore it or delete it or whatever. I don't ever want this back, okay? Okay. This secret we have... Can you keep it? I can keep it, But I don't know if I can live with it. I know I can't. But I don't have to. * Hang on, traveling woman * * Don't sacrifice your plan... * Did I fall asleep? - * 'Cause it will come back to you * - For a little bit. * Got to listen * * to the vision * * Some may say a dream * * Words from the unseen * * They can make you tired * * Tell you lies * * Make you fall * * Make you tired * * Tell you lies * * Make you fall * * Make you tired * * Tell you lies, make you fall. * Honeybunny VeRdiKT
