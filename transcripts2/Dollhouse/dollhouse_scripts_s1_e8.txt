 Dollhouse (2009â€“2010): Season 1, Episode 8 - Needs - full transcript 
 Echo, Victor, Sierra, Mellie/November, and another Active mysteriously awaken with them aware of their identities, but not their memories. The five of them start to search for answers about the Dollhouse facility they as well as how they got there and how to escape. In trying to find her own answers, Echo discovers more about herself, while Victor and Sierra escape to look for the man who recruited Sierra, and November searches for her missing daughter. But Adelle soon learns about the Active's glitch and sets her own agenda with the help of Boyd, Dr. Saunders, Dominic, and Topher to help her out. Meanwhile, Ballard discovers the hidden surveillance camera in his apartment and it sets him back on the path to finding the Dollhouse.

 You. I only have a few minutes. They can't know this body left an engagement. Are we not fighting this time? I have a message for you from inside the Dollhouse. What? Sit back and wait some more while they dismantle my life? I could handcuff you right now and bring the Dollhouse to my door. So, you tell me, who sent you? You have something we need. I have something you need. And what is that?

 I'm not a client. I don't need that. You know you do. Caroline? Save me, Paul. - Oh, God. - Oh, my God. Mellie. I guess I took too long getting back. You're already with her. I know this is confusing for all of us. Don't stop, Paul. I need you. Paul! I'm sorry. I have a thing she needs. She's not even real. You feel me. Trust that.

 I need you to finish what you started. Caroline doesn't need anything anymore, Paul. She's dead! No. Caroline? Come back. I won't let anything happen to you. Not again. You let them hurt me, didn't you? No. I tried to stop it. How did they know? I'm trying to stop everything. How did they know what we shared? How did they know? We're all aware there have been recent problems. Ours is a complicated world. But the world of our Actives must be one of constant certainty. Whoa! Did you guys start early? I was backing up my primary drives to protect them from that. As Topher points out, we are currently upgrading our electrical and security systems. We will be instituting other changes as well. We have had an Active go off mission. Another has developed urges. Others still are showing signs of cognizance and recognition. Nearly all the Actives exposed to the N-7316 drug experienced a glitch, a random memory thread. This house is out of balance. For the Handlers, the main concern will be identifying behavioral problems that cannot be quelled and reporting them. It's easy to become attached to your assigned Active. In fact, it's necessary, but don't think of them as children. Think of them as pets. Is that supposed to be funny? If your child starts talking for the first time, you feel proud. If your dog does, you freak the hell out. Any developmental progress an Active makes is dangerous to the house and a possible first step toward another Alpha. What about the Alpha that's already an Alpha? Whereabouts unknown. Let's stay on topic. Topher? I've scrubbed them as much as I safely can. If we pursued the short-range calcium modulin K2 amplifier, I could advance the protein's corrosion of long-term potentiation. Done, whatever that means. Anything else? The sleep cycle. The sedatives and anti-psychotics we pump into the pods with the O2, the subliminal tone patterns, I think I could play with that cocktail a bit. Sleeping is their most vulnerable time. We could test it out on one chamber if you're stressed about it. If you start playing with their meds, it could backfire or damage them... Or solve the problem. I know what I'm doing, Doc. So do I. But I also care what you're doing to our pets. I will take it into consideration. I need reports at the end of every shift detailing your interactions with the Actives. Feelings they express, questions they ask, instincts you observe. Everything. We can't jump at shadows. I don't want to report that my Active asked for toast and have her sent to the Attic. We were hired to protect them. In the field, yes, Mr. Langton. In here, we protect the house. A tide is rising. Until we learn how to turn it back, we pile up the sandbags together. Unless anyone here thinks they've got a better idea. Caroline, I'm Paul Ballard. I'm with the FBI. Your name is Caroline. You don't know this, but you're being fooled, used. I would never hurt you. Do you trust me? Do you want to play the game? You remember to be very quiet during the game, right? Caroline. Caroline, wake up. Help. God. Oh, God. Help me! Help me, somebody, please! Help me, somebody! Somebody help me. Get me out of here! Oh, my God, help me! Get me out of here! Help! Help me! Who's there? Who the hell are you? Hey, I woke up in a five-star floor coffin just like you, pal. Help! Help me! Let me out! Let me out! Hey, noise. Not helping. It doesn't matter. They're listening. Anyone hear me over here? Help! - You okay? - Who's listening? Aliens. Pervs behind glass, getting off watching us. Yeah, we're in outer space, right? We're in a nuthouse, more like. What humans you know build circular pod rooms with stone cavities and peeping windows? Definitely feeling kind of lab-ratty here. I'm leaving before the electric shock. Sorry. It's a defense mechanism. I'm just really terrified. Anybody else got anything better than aliens? I'm serious about lab rats. - Maybe we're supposed to be here. - What for? I didn't do anything. - Do you know that? - I don't remember anything. I mean, I know the days of the week, the capital of Nebraska, but nothing about me. My guess, we're prisoners of some sort. We need to assess the situation, formulate a strategy... Run. Strategically. Yeah, and when they come in with guns, what do we fight with? We take the glass shade off the light fixtures, splinter them. Use them as shivs. Deranged millionaire serial killer. That's what I think. That's not stupider than aliens? Hey, watch your mouth. Hey, can we all act like humans, not monkeys? I know you, don't I? How? I think I have to get to the mountains. Everything's okay there. I lost something. Maybe it's here somewhere. They probably want to study our reproductive systems. Sex with aliens? Come on. Who doesn't wanna put alien guy back in the box? What's behind me? It's okay. Just walk towards me. Someone's out there. A lot of someones. It's been very nice nearly knowing you guys. Good luck. Hey, hold up. You need backup. I want to know what they look like. I'm not sure I do. Hey, we gotta get moving. I won't leave you behind. Please! - They're people like us. - But so calm. Maybe they know why we're here. See? I think they like it. So do we, like it like them. Got it? What you don't want is to get noticed, so until we know what's going on... Good morning, Tango. Good morning, Victor. Sierra, Mike. Hi, November, your clothes are in the changing room. How are you, Echo? Fine, thank you. - That's not my name. - Not names, codes. Military. Who uses those besides... Are we government prisoners? Whoa! Everyone does look peaceful. Maybe something bad happened to us. And they're helping us heal. That makes sense. Good morning. We're having banana pancakes for breakfast today. I like pancakes. We're all gonna die. I like bananas. They're naturally sweet. They're high in potassium. So's the Earth's core. That's not food. No, it isn't, Mike. A food that's naturally sweet. Apples, cantaloupe, kiwis, mango, mayonnaise. Echo, is there something wrong with your hand? No, it's fine. I don't think so. May I see it? I'm going to need to take you to see Dr. Saunders now. Hello? Echo, what's wrong? They made me come see you. About my hand. Oh, no, what happened? Oh, my God. Did they do that to you here? Echo, please, sit. No, I want to know. What the hell happened? Don't. They're watching. You work for them. Who are they? Where are we? Please. I'm not your friend in here, Echo. I'm sorry. I can't help you. I'm happy. I'm happy. Guys, I'm relaxed and I'm happy. I like banana pancakes. I want to climb the rock wall now. Isn't that what you want? Tell me and I'll do it! - Please, help! - Let me help. Help! Somebody help me! No! Mike screwed up. Got noticed. Nothing we could do. He might be okay. The doctor said she'd help. She did? You told her? She knows we're not like the others? She warned me. About the cameras. Keep walking. Co-ed showers? I don't believe it. But we have to do it. So? No big deal. Okay, New York starting lineup, 1986, first base, Keith Hernandez, second base, Wally Backman, shortstop, Rafael Santana... Keep your eyes right where they are. Mookie Wilson, left field... Third base, Ray Knight, catcher, Gary Carter, left field, Lenny Dykstra. Hey, hey, it's Mike. Hey, pal. You all right? - Yes, I'm fine. - Thank God. What happened to you? I had a treatment. What? Just a spa thing, nothing bad? Did you see the doctor? Dr. Saunders? She's so nice. I was trying to tell these guys, I think she's a prisoner, like us. No cameras here. No one's watching. Mike? Do you remember me? Lab rat? Yes, you're Echo. We woke up together, trapped. We were scared. I like sleeping in the pods. Wait. Where are you going? I'm going to swim in the pool. No, Mike, we're all going to leave. Come with us. I do 30 laps every day. It helps me be my best. We lost Mike. We save ourselves and we do it now. I'm with her. Okay. Yes, Mr. Dominic? I was just informed we have four Actives preparing to escape. Right on schedule. Will you at least allow me to brief the in-house security team? The entire staff thinks they're preparing for an exercise two months down the road. They're not ready. Every person in this house should always be ready. For anything. Every person in this house should always be ready. For anything. Echo, Sierra, Victor and November need real adversaries, real obstacles. Freedom has to be earned. We don't even have the power to end this. There's no kill switch, we can't shut them down. What if they make it out into the world and decide to shoot up a liquor store or jump off a roof? Don't be melodramatic. We could lose them all. And there's a limit to what I'll be able to clean up after the fact. I've made my decision. I forgot where the sauna is. You told me. I like the sauna. Big surprise there. He's very tired. So, the light at the end of the tunnel was... Another tunnel. Come on. No need to be aware of anything but your breath moving through your body. Tango, would you like your treatment now? Thank you. It's time. Come on. Right here. Did something happen to them? What's taking them so long? They're just being careful is all. We'll give them a little bit more time. Why don't you tell me something about yourself? I'm just making small talk. We don't remember anything, remember? Sometimes I feel like we do. The Yankees. The Mets, but whatever. And you. Are you sure? Can you tell me anything about me? I just got this feeling in my gut that something bad happened to you. Probably the same something bad that happened to all of us. I don't feel that way about anyone else. Just you. Is there any part of you that finds me familiar? - It's them. - Thank God. Nobody saw us, but who knows what the cameras got. Or who's watching them. Sophie. You're off, too? After a few hours of paperwork to wrap up the client's file. What kind of engagement were you on? I can't believe you are cheating on me with that perfect woman you just met. Now, I get everything in the divorce. Easy stuff. Seems tame next to the crap you've been dealing with. Echo's all right. They're just giving her a few days' downtime. - I can use the vacation. - Lf you ask me, she's not gonna last. I haven't given up on her yet. Look, Boyd, you're a classy guy, but you really shouldn't get too attached. It's like Mr. Dominic said. They're pets. Even a good dog needs to be put down sometimes. Stairwell ends this level. There's got to be another. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong? - Look at me. Look. - Huh? Tell me, what's wrong? Keep an eye on the hall. I remember... Men. They had guns. They took me away. I remember the man who put me here. Then we'll get him, understand? I will get him, but you gotta be strong for me now and go with us, so you can help me find him. Still no windows. We gotta be underground. We need to find another way. - This way? - Yes. This just keeps getting weirder and weirder. Whoa! - What is all this for? - Us. These all say "Echo." There's a rack for each of us. Yeah, there is. We can blend in more now. This fits perfectly. Hmm. Maybe these are clothes from our former life. Never mind. Let's go right now. Wait. I thought we were getting changed first. I have a daughter. Katie. Okay. We'll get you out of here. What's wrong? She has a daughter. Please help me find her. I don't know where she is. Someone's coming. Who has the card thingy? What did you just do? - Calling the elevator. - What if somebody's in it? We don't have a choice, do we? Go up or go back. Anyone going back? I can't believe we made it. Start checking doors, see if any of them are unlocked. We need to tell someone about what's happening. Should we call the police, the FBI? For all we know, this is the FBI. What about everybody inside that needs help? We do nothing until we understand what this place is and who we can trust. Guys, a car's coming. When you wear the uniform, you got to push it all down, bury it. It never happened, right? The good guys lost one today. I had to watch a man die, and I'm just supposed to make it disappear? Guys, wait here. Did you hear that? Someone died. He said he was one of the good guys. But he went in there. How do we know who to trust? We trust each other. We figure this out together. We start with what we know. You know your name's not Sierra. And the guy that put you here, what's his name? - I don't know. - No, you do know. What's his name? His name... His name... His name is Nolan. See? And you know Katie, your daughter. And you're gonna think hard and remember where to find her, right? And I know a mountain house. It's safe there. I need to go there. Guys, look sharp. Wheels up. Look out. You know I don't understand when you speak French. That's Tango. Let's get out of here. On your toes, people. We have a black SUV, license plate number 386 PCE, embarking with the following four Actives, Victor, Sierra, November and Echo. Here we go. Wait. What are you doing? What's wrong? Get back in the car! I can't leave. Did you see Tango, that sweet girl? That is not a costume warehouse we just busted out of. That's a people warehouse. You have to come with us. The army guy they brought back... They're doing it both ways. They make people go out and do terrible things, and then bring them back and make them go away. And you'll be putting yourself back in there. You didn't fight to get out for nothing. Not nothing. You guys are okay now. I go back in knowing that. This thing, it's too big. There's too many of them. They got guns. What do you think you're gonna do? Try and make a difference. Echo. What are you doing here? Don't touch that. It's okay. I'm just gonna call Boyd. Remember Boyd, your Handler? You know him. You trust him. - I said don't touch it. - Okay. I'm a friend of his. Maybe I can help. Do you know what you need? Give me the key. No one here wants to hurt you, Echo. I don't want to hurt you. I'm just gonna tell Boyd you're here, and he'll come and take you for your treatment. All right? You Jimmy? Good day to you, too. Ever seen one of these? Yeah. Just now, on the counter in front of me. I really hope you don't wanna pretend you don't butter your bread this way, 'cause I'm not in a mood that's gonna care. I'm just trying to figure out what kind of business you think you got here. Look at it. Look. Any closer, and it will come out of the back of my head. These don't even exist yet. Meaning what? Meaning, if me and everyone else I know powwowed, we still wouldn't figure this out. It's gorgeous. Can I trace where it was transmitting? Absolutely. If you were E.T. It inverts the frequency into white noise. The only way you could find it once it hits the universe is to know exactly which speck of dust you're looking for and tune in on it. What about scrambling it? Someone put this on you? Huh? You're gonna need an RF detector, SMART scrambler and frequency jammer. And to believe in God, 'cause I don't care how big you think you are, they're bigger. Can't remember which way to go until I see it, but I'm pretty sure we're almost there. You've been saying that for 20 minutes while I've been circling. I know. I'm so sorry. Stop the car. What? - I know where Katie is. - You do? - That's wonderful. - Let me out here. Can I take you there after we deal with this guy Nolan? She says we're almost there. I'm going alone. We can't just leave you here. Until we figure things out, we should stick together. Help each other. I remember my life. - You're sure? - Yes. All right then. It's why we left. We decide for ourselves now. Good luck. You, too. I hope it's easy for you to go back home. Whatever it is. Well, let's get a tail on her. November separated from the group. Is that an Active leaving Dr. Saunders' office? Rewind it. Oh, my God. She was in the car. Apparently, she's got one step ahead of us. I should've seen this coming. This is Caroline. Minus the memories, but it's her. And this is exactly what Caroline would do. Try and take us down by herself? You want me to call it in? Round her up? No, there's no harm in letting this play out. Caroline never was very realistic. Apparently this is exactly what she was... - Stop her? - Immediately, please. This is Mr. Dominic. We have a rogue Active. Check the power room first. Topher. Status. Hard to see. Some confusion. Are the Actives afraid of the dark? Who knows? They've never seen it. We always leave the lights on. Is this that power thing from yesterday or... - Echo. - Really? Did she cut the main line or did she go for the... Can you find her? I'm looking out the window, but am hindered by a lack of illumination. Just be ready when they bring her in. To do what? No power, no chair, no wipey. I am, BTW. Am what? Afraid of the dark. Hello? Echo? Not anymore. We are experiencing a temporary interruption of power. We assure you there is no need to worry. Everyone please gather calmly on the main floor. We should probably go downstairs with everybody else... Is that blood on your hands? It's kind of dark. I was hoping that it was... Tell me what you do to people in here. They come in one way and when they leave, they're something else. Uh... It's complicated. But I use a process of epifluorescent light... Make it simple. Simple, right. I put them in a chair and I program them. You can't program people. We're not frigging computers. Not that different. Our brains are natural motherboards. Everything we think, feel, do, electrical impulses fired by the brain. I just hack the system. I just hack the system. What year is this? 2009. How long have I been here? A little while. A day? A month? Kind of more. My head. Why I don't remember things, you've done it to me. You put me in this chair. Uh... - Where? - It's... Show. Don't tell. Priya. I'm surprised and confused. Is this some kind of frequent buyer reward or... It's him. Hey, what's going on? A little blackmail, maybe? I wouldn't put it past you people. What you did to me, putting me in that hell. What did I ever do to you? You said no. And nobody ever says no to me. Because I wouldn't have sex with you, you took away my whole life? Do you have any idea how much trouble that was? I mean, all the strings I pulled and the palms I greased, I could've bought Pierre Island. But owning you is better than real estate. So, you're not her Handler. We got out of that freak show. She's never going back. Ah! I get it. You kids hopped the fence. It doesn't matter. You don't exist anymore. I'm more of a person than you. Honey, you're programmed to give me and anyone else whatever we want whenever we want it, which you do with pleasure. And sometimes you even beg. Okay. I can afford one hell of a security system, so... I have one, all right? Folks were on their way to grab you up before you hit the elevator, so... Go. We gotta go. You will see me again. Yes, and I look forward to it. This way. It'll be even better now. You put this in and it makes us whatever you want? Yes. I mean, you have to have power to do that, electricity, which we don't, so we can't. You should put that down. This is seriously screwed. What the hell is wrong with you people? We're good people. Nice people. We help people become better people by giving them what they need. I don't usually do the sales pitch. You murder people. You gut them and use their bodies as playthings. Who was I before you killed me? No, no, no. You are not dead, clearly. You volunteered. - You're lying. - Okay. You don't have your memories. I didn't give them to you, so you don't remember that. In there. Last time you put me in there, you made me what? You, as you were when you came here, only without memories, which you will get back when your contract is up and you leave here and go and do whatever you want. Grow a belly, sew a quilt, spend that truck of money you made having just the time of your life. Yeah, this is fun. Isn't it? Why am I not like them, the rest down there, what they're like when you're not pimping them out? We're running a test on you. I remember a mountain. Somewhere peaceful. Beautiful. I feel happy there. I want to go there. Is that real or is that part of your test? Real. How come it's there if you didn't give it to me? It's coming from you. It's what you need. I have your memories. You can have them back. - You can do that? - Totally. But I have to go in there. Well, yeah, but... - Okay. - Okay. You first. Who are they? Maybe Nolan's guys. - What do they want? - Take us back, probably. Or kill us. That's the only way out. This way. Hey, it looks like it fits. You can't imprint on top of a fully functional brain, it'll implode. Oh, is that why you keep us so simple? Yes. Yes. Does it hurt when you do it? Pain is nothing more than nerves talking to your brain. Look, I'm just the science guy. Up here looking down on everyone, playing God. I can help you with anything you want. You just have to tell me. I want you to let them go. I don't have that kind of power. What... I'd pick the chair. It's just a treatment. No, no, no! I can't. I swear I can't. I can. Stop the imprint, please. My chair! Did I just kill someone, or should I aim this at her head? She doesn't really understand. You wanted to forget. Who are you? Adelle DeWitt. I am responsible for this facility and everyone in it. Then you are one sick bitch. I eased your suffering. Is that what you think you're doing here? I'm certain of it. Taking away basic human rights, free will, my right to choose, feel, remember? All relinquished by you to our care and discretion. Tell me why I would. I can't. I would be breaking a promise I made to you. All I can say is that you couldn't live with the consequences of your own actions, and you no longer have to. You're letting us all go. You're free to leave. Who are you to decide for the others? Something you should have been asking yourself. I made the same promise to them, to protect them from the unbearable truths that brought them here. I won't return those memories. So, we agree. No one gets in the chair. They'll be back. Maybe. I'm sorry. This is all my fault. If you didn't want to help me, this wouldn't have happened. Exactly. When we were in that place, when we were like what Mike turned into, what the rest of them were, empty, I remember you. What? It's like I'm stuck inside my head somewhere, and some part of me sees and feels... It's like a bad dream I can't get out of. I... I can't talk. I can't move. I can't be stronger than what's taken me over, but I'm there. That's awful. Somebody hurt you. Like Nolan. I could see it happening. Oh, God, I could see his face, but I couldn't stop it. I trusted him. Why did I trust him? - I'm sorry. - Wait. Wait. You wait for me when we go to bed at night to make sure I'm okay. Right? What have they done to us? Down this way! I don't know which to hope for. Feels like dying either way. No. We'll look for each other like we always do. And we'll finish this. We will. You can't take them outside as they are. They'll find the stimulation, the conflict entirely overwhelming. They'll do just fine. Your unbearable truth, lady, you're not as important as you think you are. Next one goes where your heart should have been. Now, show us out. The devil that you know Is better than the one you don't And so where it goes Like lonely ghosts At the roads I crossed We stay because We don't know where else to go The places our old haunts They'll miss us when we're gone We can never move on So, like lonely ghosts At a roadside cross we stay A tide is rising. And until we learn how to turn it back, we pile up the sandbags together. Unless anyone here thinks they've got a better idea. We give them what they need. Dr. Saunders? Closure. If Actives have particularly poignant or reoccurring experiences, these can cause desires, emotional needs, or reactivate old ones that existed before they came here. Open loops. If they were able to close those loops, to get some sense of resolve... You're recommending we allow them to take a self-guided journey. Just the priority cases. Let the tide come in. It's the only way to wash it back out. Has the tide turned? Are they better now? Each Active's brain was programmed to release a sedative the moment they felt closure. They're all back with us, so I have to assume they've resolved the issues that caused them to glitch. November needed to grieve for her daughter. I understand that. And Sierra, she needed to confront the man who took away her power. One of them, anyway. As I recall, you confronted the other one. And Echo. She wanted to free us all. What about Victor? He wasn't going back to a trauma or need from his past. He had a more present need. He needed to get the girl. He's in love. When Echo was leading them out, I would like to have seen that. Even if it was all a game. Your game. Do you think I had fun? I don't know you very well. You have to look after Echo. I have to look after all of them. She wasn't leading them to freedom. She was leading them to a world of terror and chaos that would have destroyed them. She's not leading them anywhere anymore. You should be grateful. Yeah. I'll work on that. The devil that you know Is better than the one you don't Like lonely ghosts At a roadside cross We stay because We don't know where else to go We stay because We don't know where else to go New message. Paul Ballard, this is... You don't know me, but I have a file. And your name is in it, and I think we've met. - I know it sounds crazy... - Caroline. ...but we're here, somewhere underground. I'm trying to get everyone out, but if I can't, please... Please find us. Corrected & Synced by Bakugan
