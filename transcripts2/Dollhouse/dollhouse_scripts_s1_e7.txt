 I'm going to make you an offer. I told you, all I want is to be left alone. We both know we're past that. Gee, what gave it away? The big, black van? Or the being held in this room for two days with no fricking idea where I am? My offer is this. Your life for your life. I get five years, you get the rest. You'll be free. Is that you talking or the Rossum Corporation? - Why me? Why did you pick me? - Caroline, you picked us.

 This is a good thing, Caroline. I know what I saw, what started this. You and I have been doing this dance for almost two years. I thought you'd have learned by now. Nothing is what it appears to be. Please, any hack can do a regenerative study. Any hack with two years and a $50 million lab at their... Owen? Fly, be free. - Fly. - Owen? Fly, be free. - Owen, you okay, buddy? - Fly, fly! Owen? Fly, fly. - Hey, Owen. It's us. - Fly, fly. Fly! Owen?

 - Owen, it's okay. - Fly! Fly! Gravity's not the equation. Owen? Owen? Hey, stop! Owen, stop! Oh, my God! That is one of only two existing vials of our most promising new memory drug. The other vial is missing. I don't need just one Active on this. I need an army. I've already rearranged the schedule. The boots are as good as on the ground. If this is about Foxtrot speaking Mandarin instead of Cantonese, - it was a very simple... - Topher. This is... Clive Ambrose. Co-chairman of the Rossum Corporation, third richest man in the country, nominated for a Nobel Prize. I might throw up. That's a compliment. Something really bad happened. There's been an incident at Fremont College. Owen Johnson. He was a grad student at one of our premiere labs. But not anymore. Owen ingested a psychotropic modification of a phenethylamine compound. One of the memory drugs Rossum's got in R&D;? N-7316. It breaks down natural inhibitions in the hippocampus in order to awaken sleeping parts of the brain. We're still in the experimental stage. Phase one of N-7316 manifests like a recreational narcotic. - Giddiness, light hallucinations. - Munchies. Phase two apparently manifests as a complete loss of impulse control. Could be phases, could be a little thing I'd like to call body chemistry. We're all our own little cesspools of hormones, enzymes, chemical reactions. It's the same as any drug. Heroin, cocaine, caffeine, how your body reacts depends on a multitude of indefinable factors. You snort horse once, don't like it, you go back to your organic tea, have a nice life. I do it once, whoo, I'm doing two bags a day for 20 years. One toot for you, adi?s, amigo. That's what's so exciting about drugs. Not that I'd know. We do biweekly drug tests. Just pure scientific observations. How did the drug find its way into the general campus population? We don't know. Maybe Owen was selling it. Maybe he or someone else put it in the soda machine in the dining hall. One vial is enough to take out the entire student body. No antidote floating around, I'm guessing. Right now the best we can do is sedation. We're hoping you can help us do better. While you work on an antidote, a team of Actives will secure the campus and try to locate the missing vial. Oh, right. They'd be immune. How did you know that? All right, this baby attacks the inhibitors in the hippocampus to break down the repressed memory blocks, right? Actives don't have them. Stuff would bounce right off. Think you can help us, Mr. Brink? Well, I can't hurt. Probably. Start with the imprints and get the Actives in the field. - Lf you need any extra help... - No, cool. - Echo's on an engagement, right? - Yeah, old client, new fantasy. - I should call her back in? - No, she can sit this one out. So, what do you think? Wow, I've never seen anything like it. It looks like a dragon. - Is that stupid? - Uh, here. - Oh, no, thank you. - Alice, you're going to drive this bike. - I am? - Yeah. You're gonna do a lot of new things today. Okay. Wow. Are you making breakfast? It's kind of late, but since I'm a gentleman of leisure, and you've taken up professional sleeping... Mmm... - Didn't know I could cook, did you? - Nope. Good. Then you won't be disappointed when you find out I can't. Paul, listen, take those off 'cause they're done. And, listen, I'm a grown-up person. We got impulsive and five minutes later, someone nearly killed me in your apartment. - I know you feel an obligation... - That's not what... Hey. I don't think you don't like me. But we don't fast-forward to the honeymoon just because I had a bad day. I like taking care of you. I'm glad. I think you're dreamy. But in my dream, I'm stronger than you know. - I think you proved that when you... - That was luck. I'm not a prize fighter. That Russian thug had two left feet. I wish he had. It would have been a lot easier to ID a guy with two left feet. They did ID him. They got a name, which I guarantee you wasn't his. I took a set of prints myself, though. Got a friend who can access a few databases outside of the Bureau's reach. The Dollhouse found this guy somewhere. Professional killers are made. They're trained. I'm sorry. You don't want to talk about this. - You're off the case. - Officially. They suspended you. So far as the Dollhouse is concerned, I'm not a threat anymore. - This is the perfect time... - You can't drop it? - You said you thought this was important. - And they tried to kill me. - Mellie, I promise you... - You can't promise. It's blind luck that I'm not dead already. What you can do is drop the case. Let someone else handle it. Yeah, you love taking care of me. I think you know your way across the hall. Let's go. You guys are up there. Go. All right, guys. Everybody knows where they're going, right? Come on. Let's move it. All right, let's go there. Energy. We're gonna do the grid. Six guys and girls, women, searching this campus top to bottom. - I want that other vial. - Yes, sir. Tom, this is Dr. Gawa from the Center for Disease Control. Super. I haven't heard a good "flesh-eating strain of something horrible" story in a while. Yeah, I've got dozens. Hopefully today won't be worth talking about. Let's find these kids and get them better. I've got you set up at the Kappa Zeta Chi house. - And, Tom, you'll be running the grid. - The grid's taken care of. I'll be too busy rounding up our day-trippers to look under mattresses. - That's my call. - Actually, it's mine. You're NSA? Which outranks Rossum Private Security by more than a whole bunch. Topher. All right, fine, I'll stay here and be the communications command post. First have someone show Dr. Gawa to Kappa house. - You good? - Yeah. - I've always wanted to go to a frat party. - Let's go. Are you sure you're okay? I'm okay if you're okay. - I'm great. Is that terrible? - No, it's wonderful. - I'm not sure how to work this, but... - Okay. Oh, God, what if somebody sees it? Only us. Okay, my life on it. I never thought I'd... Oh, I've lost picture. Sorry. No, just... On the side, there's a button. Oh. The tragic suicide appears to be a case of a stressed-out student who didn't know how to ask for help. Fremont College officials have said that counseling will be available on the campus throughout the week. Reactions on the campus... I have to go. I have to help him. Alice, is everything all right? - I'm terribly sorry. I have to go. - Yeah, very funny. I have to get him out of there. Okay. It's not actually that funny! Alice? That was a door. You know what I want to do tonight? Let's drive to that thing up north. You know, we don't have to go to every antiwar demonstration in the state. Yes, we do. - Caroline, I love you. - I love you. - Are you comfortable? - Yes, thank you. I'm gonna give you a shot. And then I just need you to sit still for a while. - Can you do that? - Lf you like. Just think about pretty things. Rainbows. She's immune, but maybe this will help me find an antidote. All righty. Let's see exactly what this stuff is doing so we can undo it. This may take a while. Be patient. - What shall I do, think about rainbows? - Go for it. Or shall I think about how that glorified dog's body, Clive Ambrose, can't keep his affairs in order? You could have said no. The Rossum Corporation is why we exist. And I believe in the work we're funding. I also believe that the only reason I don't have Clive Ambrose's job is 'cause he couldn't handle mine. So, now we're sharing. Can you just figure out a way to keep people from killing themselves on this drug? We have more than a few in the early stages, and sedating them is hardly a cure. It'll buy me time. As long as we keep the place locked down and don't have any more X factors, then here I come to save the day. I got it. Can you get me a juice box? Are you lost? Hi. Um... No. Do you go to Fremont? Um... I don't know. There's parts that seem... - I don't know. - You can come with us. - We got one more. - Copy that. Where are we going? No, I don't know anything is wrong. Maybe that's the client's new fantasy. Send a doll to college. - Which college? - Fremont. - I tracked Echo here. - Please, God, be joking. Why? What's up? Your brain rocks. We have a major engagement happening there. Echo cannot interfere with it. Get her out of there quickly. And if you need assistance, call Dominic. Do you understand? Hold on. Yes? There are mansions in your eyes. Did you know that? You can see the doors... Excuse me. No, I definitely don't understand. I don't think I'm supposed to be here. Sit down. I'm just gonna give you a little shot. Sit down. The television made me. I had to come here. A shot of what exactly? You ingested a powerful narcotic. I need to make sure you don't hurt yourself. Matt and I don't do drugs. I have somewhere to be, not here. Just relax. What do they need babies for? Rossum. - No! - I don't think she wants the shot. I'm not on drugs! The window glass, it's coming for us. Fine. I'll get you the liquid gel. You, too. Don't worry. It wears off. I mean, I'm starting to feel normal again. Sort of. The walls stopped moving. I'm not supposed to be here. I have to save him. - Who? - I love you. I don't know. Him. - I have to get into Rossum. - The Rossum lab? This about Owen? What do you know about Rossum? Just that I have to get into the building. You know, I think they did this. Put something in the water, using us as guinea pigs. Guinea pigs? Yeah, I mean, I'm guessing that we're all nice, neat entries in someone's lab journal. You know, this many affected, this many hurt... Gone. They killed my friend. I have to get to the lab. Good luck. I mean, it's surrounded by security guards. No, I can get in. I just have to listen to myself. - You're serious? - Yeah. I know a way in, I think. Which kind of freaks me out. Okay, well, I'll help you. I mean, I know that lab like the back of my hand. Oh, no. You don't have to do that. I'm not gonna let you go in there by yourself. Anyway, it's not just for you. I mean, I want to find evidence, prove they did this, and get their asses sent to jail. - I'm Sam. I think I'm glad I met you. - Alice. We gotta get out of here. Stop! It's all too big! No. No! Please. Please, no. Please put me down. Where are you taking me? Wow. That worked. Thank you. Let's get out of sight, okay? Come on. - Would you like to have a treatment? - No. Hey. Wow. Did not maintain control of that situation. I don't want to say "evil." Yeah. Yeah, you really do. The Rossum Corporation is evil. "Minds matter." Ugh! This guy gives me the heebie-jeebies. Clive Ambrose, the face of Rossum. Marketing campaign that big, he's hiding something. - That whole company's hiding something. - Yeah, for instance, animal testing. I mean, monkeys, puppies. They're torturing them. Kicking it Mengele-style, all in the name of science. - Monkeys should not be guinea pigs. - Guinea pigs should not be guinea pigs. Whatever they say in those ads, the ends don't justify the means. I have a plan. I have the beginnings of a plan. Is this when you free all the monkeys, and they go nuts and bite you to death? No. This is where we film the monkeys in their cages and put the footage online. Yeah, where millions can view it over and over again. Mmm. They'll be shamed into policy changes. And we get in how? - I mean, Rossum's got to have security. - I'm working on that part. This is not how we used to party. I spent four years partying in the shadow of that building. Do you know what they could have done in there in four years? How many living creatures they... Ugh! Someone has to stand up. It doesn't have to be you guys. I wouldn't ask it. - This is just where I am. - Yeah. That's my girl. That's my Caroline. None of these are tagged. None of this is tagged. Get on all of this. - James? - Nothing yet, sir. Well, I don't have to tell you to keep looking, - but keep looking. - Keep looking. Sure. Now you're experts. Four hours ago, you were discussing your love for apple sauce. My guys have got this fairly well-contained. Fourteen subjects exhibiting erratic behavior, sedated. - What? - We rounded up 14... - You okay? - I'm fine. Go on. - Fourteen round what? - Buddy? Hmm? - How about we head over to containment? - I'm fine. - Dr. Gawa will give you a light sedative... - Hey, I'm fine. All right. Easy, buddy. - I know how to solve problems. - You bet. Oh, man, this is, like, so heavy. It makes my arms tired. Want me to help you out with that? Okay, here we go. - All right. Come on. - Hey, wow. - It's so heavy. Extremely. - Right. Okay. Everything's heavy. Yeah, I need to speak to the person in charge at the security office. I see. Please, do keep me updated. And please take care of him. Thank you, Agent. - This is unbelievable. - What part was believable before? The drug. It's not being sold, Topher. The effects are spreading. Mr. Dominic is exhibiting erratic behavior. He didn't take any. There's no way Dom would consciously try and have fun. It could be airborne. We'd be seeing a lot more cases on the campus. Beyond, even. Exposure to a patient, whether viral or through touch, that spreads more slowly, but pretty soon, that campus is gonna fill up with wacky time bombs. We need to know what it is. Yes, well, we will when I figure it out. And reversing the effect? You making any progress? I'm working! What are you doing besides being... - Being what? - Wait a minute. Sarcastic? Unfeeling? British? - It's an animal. - Where? No! The word! Still, you have to admit, I am very British. I don't say hard R's. You know what I like? Brown sauce. What's it made of? - Science doesn't know. - It's made of brown. Brown. Mined from the earth by the hardscrabble brown miners of North Brownderton. Oh, my God! I find lentils completely incomprehensible. What the sun-dappled hell is Echo doing at Fremont? That's got nothing to do with the drug, which means our problems are huge and indomitable. Ooh. I could eat that word. Or a crisp. Do you have any crisps? You haven't seen my drawer of inappropriate starches? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, my God, I'm having such a terrible day. Sorry it's not much, but the scholarship doesn't cover a decorating fee. It's nice. - So, you used to go to school here? - No. I went back east. I think. I mean, I did. I went to Colby. Okay. So, someone you know went here. A boyfriend? I don't know. I mean, I woke up this morning, and everything was normal. And then I met Matt, and we did stuff. And then I saw the Rossum Building on TV, and I had to leave, and I can't really deal with a lot of questions right now. Yeah. It's been a weird, bad day. Say no more. Okay, so, we are here and Rossum Building is here. - The lab is on the second floor. - That's where I save him. Alice, I don't want you to expect too much. There may not be a "him." There might not be the proof against Rossum you're looking for, either, but that's not stopping you. Nothing stops me, my mother's voice is too loud in my ear. - Mama's boy. - I ain't got no choice. I'm all she's got. So, you remember how to get in this building? Underneath. That's the way in. Okay, you're not overwhelming me with specificity. Lily Foundry. We have to find Lily Foundry. Listen to me carefully. I've got a huge phalanx of machines that go ping, and this is carried by anyone exposed to it, through touch. It is mandated that you get any Rossum operatives off the grounds and send them back here. Say hi for me. Nope, you dolls, you're... By which, of course, I mean NSA, CDC folks, you're safe as houses. Because of the government. They do things. But anyone else who comes in contact with the drug is susceptible. Am I sure? I am fairly sure. Secret Agent Victor is so lofty. I have a good story about him. Hold on. Hold on. I have another call. I have another call. I have a better call. Boyd! Did you find Echo? What... Boyd. Did you find Echo? It's all right, Ms. DeWitt. I've worked it out. Worked out what? Is Echo contained? Just listen. - It's around here somewhere. - You mean, she's around here. I don't think it's a person. I think Lily Foundry is an it. So, we're looking for an it? Uh-huh. Caroline. Caroline Farrell! - Excuse me? - I knew that was you. That's not me. I'm sorry. Professor Janack. We charted the whole history of the Americas together. Her name is Alice, but have a good day. I don't know this person, do I? No, she's tweaked. She needs to be sedated. We make choices. I'm well aware that there are forces beyond our control, but even in the face of those forces, we make choices. And then we live with them. And then we die with them. I know why Echo went to Fremont. - To punish you? - To let Caroline punish me. Are you ever gonna shut up about her? Is she what you think about when you're on me? Would you let me die, Paul? Would you be relieved? You said it didn't affect them. She's not tripping. She's glitching. She's remembering. There are three flowers in a vase. The third flower is green. There are three flowers in a vase. Then my odyssey takes me to the city clerk's office, where, it turns out, the counter jockeys aren't opposed to a little "you scratch my back with a wad of cash, "and I scratch yours with sealed planning records," and voil?. - Blueprints. I'm riveted. - You are a snide bitch. - I know. I love that about me. - Me, too. Well, these look like really boring building plans. Yeah. I thought so, too, the first two hours I stared at them, but then I saw... Oh! - Nice work, babe. - Yeah, I'm totally in the dark here. They put in these utility tunnels here. Yeah, but according to these plans, the room they lead to is empty. So, if you wanted to, say, move things in and out of the lab without opening the front door... You'd go in here. Babe, this is good news. Where's your happy face? Rossum is seriously powerful, and this just became real. It's always been real to me. Caroline, I'm just saying you might not want to piss them off. Rossum is exploiting animals in the name of "science," and God knows what else. I might want to piss them off a real lot. Okay, okay. Go easy. - I'm not backing out. - You better not back out. - I'm with you. Always. - Damn right. The entrance is here somewhere. Okay, we're nowhere near the Rossum Building, and I checked all the directories for all these buildings, and still no Lily Foundry. Because you're standing on her. There. We follow the red pipe. I've been here before, but how can you not remember something and remember it at the same time? - That's just the drug making you act weird. - No. I felt it before. It pulled me here. Well, maybe you're crazy. Do you think so? What I do think is, when we get in there, we have to look for lab books, logs, chemical samples, proof that Rossum is responsible for this mess. Right there. That goes straight into the Rossum Building. Yeah? Okay, we're gonna have to move like ninjas from here on out. We're not gonna have to fight, are we? Because I don't even really know how to make a fist. Not if we do this right. Okay, so the staircase to the lab is just beyond the lobby. Now, timing is everything. Now, just pretend like we're playing a video game, and I'm gonna go first, and when he turns his back, then you go. I don't play video games. You. I'm so sorry that I tried to kill you. - It's okay. - No, it's not okay. I tried to burn you to death. Who does that? - What's the holdup? - He says he tried to kill me. He's been exposed. Oh. Um... It's okay. Really, whatever you think you did, I'm over it. You know, water, bridge, under. Please, I'm begging you, don't walk away. I need your forgiveness. You got it. You don't mean it. You still hate me. I can see it in your eyes, right? And you just keep looking at me with them. I mean it. I forgive you. Look, the guns, right? The running around, the barking orders. This is not all there is to Laurence Dominic. No, ma'am, this is just my job. I'm not just hard edges. I mean, look at me. Check this suit out. Check this suit out. Oh, no. Oh, no, not again. How many times have I told you he's not a nice doggie? I don't want to pet him. Mr. Dominic? Mr. Dominic. I hear you're feeling a little under the weather. I think I might have something that might help. He's not a nice doggie. I don't want to pet him. He'll attack me. No! Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. All right. Everybody with a firearm, turn it in, now. Right here. Let's get our friend sedated. You remember to be very quiet during the game, right? Noise is upsetting. Lift up your dress. Stay away from me. No, no, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. We gotta move now. - No. - Let's go. Please. It's not... ...a fun game. It's... If I move now, you're gonna die. Please, wait. Listen, wait! Soft like a kitty. Mmm. I don't hear anything. She didn't finish the trigger code. She's probably right as rain. Go check. - I am your superior! - In every way. Go check. He dumped the stock. He ran out of options. - Help me get her into the chair. - I can't deal. Help me get her into the chair. - We need to wipe this out of her. - It doesn't make any sense. Then you make it make sense. You think I float around like a balloon, untethered to your muck? Flip. I run this house. No, no. It doesn't make any sense. Except Actives' brains aren't like ours. I mean, we alter them this way and that, so, N-73, blah, blah, blah. It hit the Actives later, all right? And differently. Like, a memory glitch. Which means the compound is breaking down into a protease and zipping right through our man-made memory blocks. November glitched to a traumatic memory. I bet the same thing is happening to the other dolls. Upside is the drug's devolving. A couple hours, it will be gone. How do you explain the man who lost his brain down his shirt? Had an extreme dose. Way more than you can absorb. Way more than he would have taken. It's a murder. It's different. - Yeah? What did it used to be like? - I don't know. Right where I left it. I have to stop him. Who? Something awful. Is that the drug? You found it. You found it really fast. Sam? What are you... Okay! I'm sorry. Look, I'm really sorry. I'm sorry. We're in. Leo, over here. What do they need babies for? This is Rossum. They don't care about souls. Human or animal. What are they doing to you? Are you getting this? Babe? You gotta see something. What is it? Science fiction? They're not just experimenting with animals. Babe, we gotta get footage of... Are they... - What the hell are they doing? - Something really not good. I told you Rossum was evil. Here. Take this. You get the animals. - I'm gonna see what I can find out here. - Yeah. Look at her. Do we have to just leave her here? Babe, it's not a pet shop. We can't take them with us. - Hey! Don't move! - Go! Run! What did you do? Make it stop. Please. I'm sorry about this, okay? I didn't want to do this, any of this. All these people, why did you hurt them? This right here is my chance for something. Owen and me were gonna take this over to Bel Med Tec. In Switzerland? Number two drug company in the world right after Rossum. You know what they'd pay for this? Billions. - You're insane. - Nobody's perfect. - You do love a fight. - So we're going? You're a killer. Listen, Owen was my best friend. And him dying, I didn't want that. I just wanted to get him out of the way long enough for me to get out of town. I didn't know he'd hurt himself like that, okay? - He knew what you were gonna do. - It was his idea. And then he got scared, said Rossum would come after us. He tried to stop me. Just because you didn't mean it doesn't mean you didn't kill him. You're responsible. You think about it your way and I'll think about it mine. - Enjoy your trip. - No. Here. Leave it! Leave it! No! Leave it! Run! No! You're a killer, Sam. You killed him! I love you, and you're gonna be okay. - Come on, we have to get out of here. - Shh! They went down the west corridor! Okay, okay. Leo, come on. Again, so sorry about the burning alive thing. Stay with me. I need you. Leo, please. I'm your girl. Leo. Please, Leo! - Leo, stay! Please stay! - Get off of me, you crazy bitch! - Echo? - Mmm? Would you like a treatment? Yes. Ms. DeWitt, I'm glad you could come. You seemed quite confident she fits the profile. Yes. She's been through a lot. You were right to call. - She was just here. - She won't get far. - Mr. Dominic, please come in. - Thank you. - Would you like a drink? - No, thank you. All the Actives have been evaluated and processed. Everything seems satisfactory. Wonderful news. - Yours, I believe. - Yes. Thank you. The press is running with the story we sold them. "Student drugs classmates before committing suicide." And Echo? I suppose you'll be recommending she be sent to the Attic. - That's entirely your call, ma'am. - For God's sake, quit calling me ma'am. We got drugged. We behaved like idiot children. It happens. It's over. You may go. And so they say for everything a reason For every ending a new beginning Oh, so they say, baby, for everything a reason And so they say, baby, for everything a reason Were you gonna say anything? I just need to get away. It's not forever. I get it. I'm sorry. Debbie might crash here sometimes, if you hear a noise. - Lf you need to reach me... - You know what? Maybe it's better if I don't know where you are. - In case. - Yeah. Okay. Okay. Mellie? You know where I am. This should help you relax. I don't want to relax. I want the hell out of here. I understand. You can't hold me. You have to have cause, evidence. I'm not with the government. Well, then who the hell are you? I'm someone who can give you what you want. - And what do I want? - A new life. A better life. Your mother, Antoinette Jennings of 483 Helena Street, I understand she's experiencing some financial difficulties. In fact, she's about to lose her home. - Do not threaten my mother. - Quite the opposite. Once you sign these papers, your mother will begin receiving a monthly stipend large enough to solve her financial problems. It will continue for five years, and at the end of that time, you will be quite capable of supporting her all on your own. How? I'm going to make you an offer. Corrected & Synced by Bakugan
