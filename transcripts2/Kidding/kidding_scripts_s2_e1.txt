 Previously on Kidding... Our next guest is celebrating his 30th anniversary in children's television. I had a son named Phil. He died. Will, we're finally getting new neighbors. If Jill finds out you bought the house next to her, she'll take Will and leave. I saw Jill hugging another man. You mean fucking. Please don't use a bad word when you can use a good word.

 Are you and Dad getting divorced? No. Why would you ask me that? I think Scott might be gay. I need to know, did you have sexual relations with the Japanese version of your brother? I want you to know that you can come by the house whenever you like. Tonight? We could go for a walk. Will's smoking reefer like a jazz musician. You are breaking your father's heart with this shit. I have a tremendous amount of pent-up anger. And I know I dress like a Mormon and I talk like a monk, but inside, I'm Mount St. Helens

 and it's 1980 and I am magma from the neck down. Thanks for trusting me with Will. You wanna smoke a joint? Do you think your dad's gonna kill - your mom's new boyfriend? - No. That wouldn't be nice. As long as I've known the both of you, I have enjoyed watching your shared and selfless language of kindness. Yours is a chemistry built on the mutual love of love itself and the knowledge that each of you contains the inner strength to tackle every challenge together. Aw. To borrow a tradition I admire from another faith... May your love last as long as it takes to put this glass back together. This part always felt a little violent for holy matrimony. You have it in you. I know it. Go on, Jeff, smash it. I love you... Jill Piccirillo. Gosh, I hope so, after all that buildup. Ooh! Hello? Mr. Pickles, this is Bobby Belongo with the South Bend chapter of the Pickles Platoon. I've got a bunch of rowdy Pickle Pals here who wanted to serenade you on Christmas Eve. My goodness... what talent. And this is Danny. Danny earned the most pickle points this year, and as a reward, he gets to wish you good yule tidings all by himself. Merry Christmas, Mr. Pickles. Merry Christmas, Danny. Have you been a good boy this year? He was on drugs. Peter? - Peter. - Peter. I'll call 911. He's unresponsive. Cervical spine's intact. Multiple traumas to the chest and abdomen... tell them! How many traumas is multiple traumas? - Are you okay? - You talking to me? Jeff, you were in a car accident. Are you hurt? No. Thank you for asking. Please stay on the line. Calls are answered in the order they are received. It's Christmas Eve. You'll never get through. - Is he dead? - We need to put him - on some kind of stretcher. - This my fault. - I did this. - He took an Ambien. Who knows what he was thinking? He probably walked right in front of you and didn't even realize it. Jeff, Jeff! Jeff! If he's not on an operating table in 20 minutes, he is going to bleed out. I need you. Help me. Is my toboggan still in the garage? I think we should see other people. What else does he need? He needs you to drive as fast as humanly possible! Don't do drugs! Hold on, Pete. We're gonna get ya help! Yeah, yeah... No! Oh, it's just Santa! - It's just Santa! - Okay. - Oh! - Um, uh, hold on. Just kick it! Kick it! I'm gonna call out the road, and you're gonna repeat it back, okay? - Okay. - Sharp left! Sharp left. Ah! - Gimme your hand! - Huh? Gimme your hand. Gimme your hand. Huh? What? Keep your fingers gently on his neck. I need you to register his pulse so I can keep putting pressure on the bleeding. - Pothole! - Pothole! Ow! If you don't feel a pulse, I need you to pull over so I can perform CPR! We're almost there. Changing lanes! - Changing back! - Changing back! Fuck this fucking light! What the fuck is up with this fucking light? Hold on! Get me to the hospital. Get me to the hospital. Get me to the hospital! I'm gonna call out the road, and you're gonna repeat it back to me. - Mm. - Right turn. - Right turn. - I can't hear you. Right turn! Oh! The twins are giving me the-the hiccups. You're doin' great... Mom. Please drive faster! Okay! Oh... if Astronotter were here, he'd tell you you need to take a calming-down breath. No, he'd say, "Me-me-meep, me-me-meep." Help us, please! We need help! Weak pulse, internal bleeding. He was on Ambien and pot. - He walked into traffic. - Copy. Trauma one. Code blue! So what your dad is trying to say is... When two heterosexual people reach a point in their relationship... Did you get me everything on my Christmas list? - Pretty much. - Almost, yeah. - Cool. - A point in their relationship when, uh, things are no longer feasible... What's "feasible"? It's a Japanese word for "exciting." Hey, whatever happened to Mr. Pickles-san? He went home. He's probably in Guantanamo Bay. What's that? It's what your mom calls our bedroom. Nice. When a marriage is no longer feasible, a mutual decision is made... Well, 60-40, if we're gonna be honest. Hi. I think I killed Peter. I gotta go. We're getting a divorce. Can I open another present? Here, open this one. Can I talk to you in the kitchen, please? Don't throw it in the house. I love you, ax. So then you tried to kill him? I didn't try to kill him. I tried to hit him with my car. Did anybody see you? What did I do? You got between your kid and drugs any way you could. When Jill comes back, I'm gonna tell her everything. - Why would you do that? - I think I'll feel better - if she knew. - No, no. You need to lie right now. Under no circumstances should you tell her what you did. Or anyone. I'm sorry. I don't know how to lie. Think of it as a secret. You're good at keeping secrets. - Hmm. - Besides, if Peter dies, there's no point in confessing. Plus... she'll be single again, so that's good. If I can't be honest with her, who am I? I'm gonna tell her about buying the house too. If you tell her what you did, you will lose her. You'll lose Will. You'll lose everything. There is nothing after that. Thank you for listening to me. I'm gonna go find Jill. Fuuuuuuck. Did you see the way he lowered that body into the trunk like he'd been doing it his whole life? Like he was a sniper during the Lesbianic Wars. I hate him! How long do you think that he's been living in that house, stalking his prey? How close were you? We were on the bed. - Was there tongue? - I told her I loved her. I touched her boob. And then my dad killed a guy! Cockblock. Wait, why'd you tell her you loved her? Are you not supposed to? Seems extreme. Whatever. My mom is going to punch him in the dick when I tell her that his shit was in the closet next door! He's a straight-up killer. I bet he pickles their bodies, then serves them on a plate next to giant sandwiches. Who would eat a pickled person? Horses, man. Horses. Fuckin' sharks of the prairie, yo. I don't understand. What is the fucking delay? I'm sorry, we can't get him into surgery until the anesthesiologist on call arrives. We paged him, but he's not responding. Peter is the anesthesiologist on call. I'll find the surgeon. Ohh! Ohh! I need to tell you a few things. I have to call his family. I've never met his family! Do you know that Peter is a lapsed Mormon? He has, like, a dozen siblings, and they're all flight attendants who work for the same airline. He doesn't speak to his parents! Now I have to call his Mormon mother on Jesus' birthday! In the same sentence, I have to introduce myself and give her the worst news of her life! I can call his parents. I'm sorry this happened to you. I'm sorry he wandered into traffic and ruined your Christmas. Christmas isn't over yet. What did you wanna tell me? I'll tell you later. Sorry. I'm drunk. Jeff, Jill. Hi, I'm Dr. Hernandez. Uh, sorry I'm not in uniform. I wasn't supposed to be working tonight. Peter is in critical condition but stable at this moment. He's breathing on his own. He did lose a lot of blood, though. I'm a universal donor. Just say the word. Thank you, but we're not there yet. We'll know more in the morning. For now, I think the best thing to do is to go home and get some sleep. - I'll call you personally. - Thank you, Doctor. Hopefully he'll be up and talking by then. Mm. Let me take you home. Okay. And you... Ah... Ooh. Ohh! I... Um... Do you know that house next door? It's, uh, same as ours, only backwards and empty. When it was f-for sale... Would you mind staying here... with us tonight? Good night. Night. Hello. Mrs. Zeckhauser, uh... ...um, you don't know me, but... I'm your son Peter's, um... friend. Ho, ho, ho. Here... comes... Santa Claus. Quick, wake the other one up, and let's see if they'll harmonize. I am listening. I am listening. Are you... looking for me? No one left a plate of cookies for Santa. Mmm. So... did you tell your mom about me buying the house next door? Why did you buy it? At the time, it seemed like... a romantic gesture, to be closer to you guys. Because I love you guys. That's why I've done... everything I've done. Were you ever a sniper in Lebanon... under Reagan? I would have been 16. Didn't answer the question. Shit, that's molten lava. You okay? Please don't use a bad word... Wait. Only use a bad word when no good word will do. I'm not gonna tell Mom what you did. I will. It's important to be honest. I like seeing you two together more than I like seeing you apart. Fire in the hole! ♪ At your homecomin' and that merry... What do you think? Breakfast first... or presents? I don't know. I'm gonna call the hospital and check in. But after that? I'm not sure we have time. There's always time for Christmas. I didn't really have time to go shopping last night, so you're mostly getting things I found around the house. This is for you. It's a lamp. Ah, yes, this must have really set you back. Bulbs too! Big spender. Wait'll you see what I got for you. Cool! Is it a bicycle? Did you peek? Hello? Was it the hospital? Ma'am, your son suffered blunt-force trauma to the lower abdomen, resulting in a hepatic hemorrhage. His liver's bleeding. They can't stop it. Please let the doctor talk. She's not family. Continue. She's right. He needs a new liver within two days, or it will fail, and then there's nothing we can do. - What about a donor? - That's the next ask. We could try a donor list, but I'm afraid that won't work with our time frame. Peter's best hope is in this room. If you're a match and wish to donate a healthy portion of your liver, the risks are there, but it's, uh... well, it's the only thing to do. What constitutes a match? We'll take you into a room, ask you some questions. You'll need to have the same blood type or be a universal donor. - I'll volunteer. - Me too. You'll need relatively the same body type and build. Same gender is a big plus. Hmm. Looks like I fit the bill. - Oh, thank you, Bart. - It's not an issue, Mom. Jesus said to His disciples, "When you give," not if. That's a very noble thing you're doing. To think his first words to you after 15 years will be "thank you." Mm. I don't give for man's praise. I give for God's. Oh, and you cannot have had an alcoholic beverage in the last 72 hours. So if you'll follow me, we'll sign some papers and get started. Uh... I can't. Every year after you go to bed, Father plies us with a bottle of Hungarian pálinka. We drink every drop. We bury the empty bottles in the pet cemetery. Well, now your brother's gonna die. Lillian, I'm sure there's another viable candidate. - Why are you still here? - Dad, what's pálinka? Dad? Jeff. I think we dropped a hat. Do you see it, a little blue and pink hat? Just leave the wheelchair on the curb. Like a grocery cart. Someone will come get it. Let's go home... Dad If you move him to another hospital, he's still going to need a liver. Aren't you still married? My husband and I are separated. And isn't he also Mormon? Common misconception. Mm... may I please speak to the two of you? Is everything okay? Peter... ...didn't walk into traffic. Uh... I... ...fucked up. By the way, we are really huge fans of your show. Before we can determine your viability as a donor, I need to ask you a few questions. Why do you want to do this? Because it's important to do the right thing. - Are you a smoker? - No. Do you take recreational drugs? - No. - Not even pot? No. Ah. Ha. And... when was the last time you had a drink? June 21, 2003. That's amazing. How do you know the exact date? It was the day I was married. We're going to perform some additional tests to confirm a match... ...and get you into surgery as soon as possible. Hello? Mr. Pickles, this is Lovetenant Dale Nukem from the Austin, Texas, chapter of the Pickles Platoon. We wanted to wish you a happy holiday season and a festive New Year. Oh, my... what talent! And this is Noah. Noah earned the most pickle points this year and gets to wish you a happy holidays all by himself. Happy holidays, Mr. Pickles. Happy holidays, Noah. Have you been a good boy this year? Have you been a good boy this year?
