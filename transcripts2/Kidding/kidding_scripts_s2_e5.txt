Balloons! I love balloons! They float up so high in the sky, and when you see one of these colorful beauties, you just know it's time for a celebration. But the wonderful and terrible thing about balloons is... they don't last. They deflate. They run out of air, and sometimes... [♪♪♪] Balloons are a rainbow reminder that nothing is permanent. Parties end. Things that rise also fall. These balloons today are a special gift for a special friend, because I have invited my wife, Nurse Jill, to celebrate a change. [breathing heavily] A terrible and wonderful change. I'm a little worried, though. It's about ten minutes late, and she's not here yet. Wondering if she's gonna show up. [loud crash] Wow! What was that? [loud crashing] Whoa. Seems like it's coming from down in Pickle Barrel Falls. We'd better check it out. See you at the bottom. [♪ whimsical piano music ♪] [♪♪♪] Oh, my. [♪ frantic music ♪] What happened here? [♪♪♪] And here? - [crying] - And here? Help! Help! Snagglehorse! [♪♪♪] What happened? I reckon I don't know. Hang on! [groans and strains] Well, first the Snagglewalls caved in, then the Snaggleceiling collapsed, and the whole Snagglebarn came unsnaggled. - [loud crash] - [quavers] - Oh, my. This is serious! - [groaning] Oh, no! [Astronotter gibbering] I'm sorry, Astronotter. I don't know what's causing your houses to fall apart. [Ennui] I know who the culprit is. We all do! It wasn't me! My home is gone too! The whole Oopsie Daisy Patch is just a pile of petals. [gibbers] Well, "doomed" may be taking it a little too far, Astronotter. We just need to find Do-It-Yourself Deirdre. She can fix this right up. Chef, release the Emergency Chicken! Chicken away! [squawks] Ah! [squeaking noise] [siren wailing] Never fear. D.I.Y. Deirdre's here. Do-It-Yourself Deirdre, Pickle Barrel Falls is falling apart. I see. I think I know what's happening here. Looks like there's been an Ungluing. [all gasp] Can you fix my Snagglebarn? Of course I can. I can fix every home in Pickle Barrel Falls. [all cheer] Yay! But I'm gonna need some help. [puppets cheerfully chattering] [Maestro Fermata] Pick-a me! Pick-a me! Maybe we should wait for Jill. She's a great help. I really don't think Jill is coming. You don't know that. Our friends need homes, Mr. Pickles. [all murmur] Mm-hmm. Do you ever feel your life was topsy-turvying? Sure. And swoopy-swervying? Mm, yeah. From stem to stern? Boy, howdy, do I.

We cannot put together the whole town with good vibes and excitable intentions! It's not preposterous. if you can see Piccola Grande, the Pickle Fairy of Hope. What the heck? Piccola Grande, the Pickle Fairy of Hope. [all murmuring] The more hope you have, the bigger she is. You can't see her? No, I cannot see the Pickle Fairy, of hope or otherwise. Ennui, just try to believe, and then, look again. [♪ whimsical music ♪] [♪♪♪] Ennui, mon ami, I know the problem looks colossal, but if you can see me, how bad can things be?

[gasps] [neighs plaintively] Oh, no! What happened? Where's Piccola Grande? [both] The Fairy of Hope has disappeared! I can fix this, I promise. Check your glue! [♪♪♪] [♪ dark piano chord ♪] It d-it-it doesn't seem to be sticky anymore. Don't fret! We can just rebuild with some new glue! There is no other glue. There's only the glue I started with. [both] What do we do now? I'm afraid the safest solution is... to find a new home someplace else. Someplace else? What do you mean? [Deirdre] I'm afraid if you lost your home, you'll have to leave Pickle Barrel Falls. [puppets murmuring anxiously] But that's half of everybody here! I just thank the good lord bread I did not suffer these problems. My home stands proud thanks to French ingenuity. [laughs] [gasps] [crashing noise] Mon Dieu! The Trifle Tower! She has fallen! Ennui! [Deirdre] Oh, I'm so sorry. What will become of moi? I'm afraid you'll have to find a new home too. But why? What did I do? What did I do? No, no, no! Ennui, wait! It's not your fault! [Ennui crying] He's right. It's my fault! Always chunking things up when I should be smoothing them over. I'm too nutty! I'm too dang nutty! I probably could've done more to preserve things. Jelly, no! [Oops] I've made mistakes. All I do is make mistakes! It's nobody's fault. Sometimes things happen in life that are beyond our control, and... the harder we try to hold things together, the more they fall apart. [both] What do you mean? Come with me.

Deirdre's right. The Ungluing isn't our fault. I'm glad you understand. It's her fault! - What? - Yeah! Her and her impotent adhesive! - [puppets jeer] - That's not the point. Oops blames you! [crowd assents angrily] Do not a-worry. We shall calm this angry mob with a soothing melody. Ah! Get her! Get her! Get her! Oh, dear! [puppets shouting angrily] [cries] My beautiful home! The greatest thing since sliced bread has been reduced to a pile of stale crumbs! [crying] [water rushing] Ennui! Zut alors! He's come to take me from my home! No, no! [crying] Ennui? Ennui? Where are you? Ennui? I am not Ennui. I am a tree. Ennui Le Tree. [cries] I've never seen a crying tree. I'm not crying. I'm watering myself. Ennui, why are you pretending to be a tree? Because trees don't have to leave. They can stay in Pickle Barrel Falls forever. They are rooted in the ground, and they never change. Actually, trees change all the time. [Bickering Beaver] Let's use this tree! No, this tree! No, this one! [growls] [gnawing rapidly] [both] Timber! Whoa! Sacrebleu! Let's follow that tree, - see how it changes. - Oui. [Bickering Beaver] Hold it this way! No, no, no. Hold it this way! No, no, no. This way! [Bickering Beaver] No, this way! [♪♪♪] [Beavers humming] [♪♪♪] You see, Ennui? Trees can become many different things. [♪♪♪] Like furniture... [laughs] [breathlessly] Giant chopsticks. [laughs] Giant chopsticks. Oh. Ooh. Small pianos. [sighs] You see? Nothing is permanent, not even trees. Everything changes. But I am afraid of this buzz saw of change. Me too. Do trees make paper too? [Jeff] Oh, yes. All kinds of paper comes from trees, and these papers are a special kind of papers. What do you mean, special? [sighs] How do I explain? [exhales] ♪ Change is a lot of things ♪ ♪ Strange ♪ ♪ Oh, the fear it brings ♪ ♪ Chan... ♪ This is Nurse Jill. I wasn't sure I was going to come, but I think it's important to show everyone there... [Jeff] [whispering] Camera two. Oh. [laughs] There... that Mr. Pickles struggles with things too. I don't want you to hide things, even when they're painful. What could be so painful, Mr. Pickles, that you require a nurse? You see, Ennui, Nurse Jill is a nurse, that's true, but she's also my wife, and we're getting a divorce. What is divorce? It's, um... Divorce is when a husband and a wife decide not to live together anymore, and that they don't want to be married to each other. [exhales heavily] Well, don't you love each other? I still love him very much. [voice breaking] I brought your favorite sweater in case you were cold. Thank you. [exhales] That's so thoughtful. And do you still love Jill, Monsieur Pickles? Of course. Then this makes no sense! I-if you love each other, why are you getting a divorce? Sometimes in life, there are problems that just can't be solved, and no matter how much we love each other, love, even a lot of love, isn't enough to keep us together. Then you are having an Ungluing? We tried to keep it all together, but the glue didn't hold. Sometimes, when bad things happen, you react in a way that hurts the other person, and you didn't even realize it. [Jeff] And sometimes, you run away from bad things at home and hide and pretend we're something we're not. Like a tree? Like a tree. [laughs] [Ennui] What will happen next, Monsieur Pickles? I don't know. [laughs] What will you do, Nurse Jill? I don't know. [laughs] I do not know what will happen to me when I leave Pickle Barrel Falls. Maybe it's for the best. What do you mean? Who can know what happens when you step into the "I don't know"? Things might be amazing there. But what if they're not? Would you rather live in a dangerous place that could come crashing down on you at any moment? No. Then welcome to the "I don't know." Oh, and those papers you asked me about earlier? Oui. Those are my divorce papers, and when I sign those, my marriage is over. [Ennui] Oh. They're my ticket to the "I don't know." But then I shall get rid of the papers, and you won't get divorced. Doesn't work that way, Ennui. [laughs] I'm sorry. I'm scared of the "I don't know," Monsieur Pickles. I'm scared too. [crashing sound] Oh, another Ungluing. No. Look, it's Hopscotch. That means it's time. Time? To leave. Come on. We'll take you. [panting] There she is! Don't let her get away! [puppets jeering] [exhausted grunt] Ennui's home was a pastry perfection, but because of you, it's now a pile of loose Danish. Now, you eat that Danish. Croissants away! [puppets cheer] Wait! Wait! No, no, no, no! No! Don't blame Deirdre. It's not her fault. Then whose fault is it? Hit her again while she's thinking of an answer! Yeah! Let's get her! No, tiny pickle. [sighs] The truth is...
