 The Borgias (2011â€“2013): Season 1, Episode 1 - The Poisoned Chalice - full transcript 
 On the death of Pope Innocent VIII in 1492, Cardinals meet in conclave to elect his successor. Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia has waited all of his life for this opportunity and he is not going to let it pass. With no successful candidate on the first and several successive ballots, he secretly communicates with his son Cesare, advising him on which Cardinals to bribe in order to get their votes. Successfully elected, he moves quickly to establish hi control over the Church. As Pope Alexander VI, he also decides that the Pope must not be chaste but be seen to be chaste and tells Vanossa, the mother of his children, that they can no longer have a physical relationship. The Pope is no sooner elected than his son Cesare discovers a plot to poison him at a banquet hosted by Cardinal Orsini.

 I have confessed. And I... confess... I am very afraid. Colonna. Sforza. Orsini. Borgia. - Your Holiness. - Della Rovere. -...Gloria Patri... You will fight like dogs over this corpse I leave for this throne of St. Peter's. But it was pure once. We have all sullied it with our greed and lechery. Which of you... will wash it clean? It shall be cleansed, Your Holiness,

 with the tears we shed for you. I swear before the Living God. You swear thus? A Spanish murrano? A white moor? As Vice-Chancellor, I swear before the Living d. - And so do I, Your Holiness. - And I, Your Holiness. - And I. Rest assured, Your Holiness. The glory of our Holy Mother Church will be restored in my lifetime. Please... ...God. There's a door behind-- leads to the street. The back passage? You're a cleric? Didn't you notice? There was nothing ecclesiastical about you last night. By night... By night I am who I want to be. By day, I am thus. Lucrezia! Sister! I spied a lady--another one! There's a punishment for spying. - What's that? - Oh, I think you know! No! Can I come to your wedding? I'll never have a wedding, you know that. No. You are betrothed to God. Don't you love God, Cesare? More than I love you? Don't be sad, brother. Maybe Papa will become pope, and you can be who you want to be. If he does become pope, I'll be what he wants me to be. Can a pope have children, Cesare? I've heard it rumoured that Pope Innocent has 12. But I have also heard it rumoured that he is dying. No news in that. He's been dying for weeks now. If he does die, will our father wear his crown? The new pope will be elected by the College of Cardinals, my love. And only God can predict the outcome. Well, since you will have no wedding, I will pray for God to choose Papa. I want to wear a beautiful white veil crowned with pearls for his coronation. God may need some help, then. - What have they heard? - The pope breathes his last. God rest his soul... We must get you out of here before they lock the doors. - And so it begins. - You know what to do? - Yes, Father. - Keep our family safe. Until the new pope is elected, it will be anarchy in Rome-- every faction fighting for its own candidate. And if--after the first vote-- if the smoke is black-- As you said, Father, I know what to do. I have waited a lifetime for this moment. We will go over it again. If we fail at the first vote, I will send word... On the wings of a dove-- ...names of those cardinals who need persuading. With properties, benefices, and, if need be, gold. They call it simony, Father. God will forgive us, my son. But I will not forgive failure... ...from you or your brother. Am I understood? We will not fail you, Father. Mm. Go now. Back to Spain, Borgia! You've had your day in Rome. You can't wring any more favours from a dead pope. I was born here, as far as I'm aware. If a pig is born in a stable, does that make him a horse? Tsk, tsk, tsk! Rome is for Romans now. The new pope will see to that. And if the new pope is Spanish? And if my mother's the Virgin Mary? Was the Virgin a Roman whore? That's news to me. Excuse me. - Ah! - Ah... My brother speaks before he thinks. He begs your pardon. I should have let them do it. Kill me? Your younger brother? Our father would never have forgiven you. Have you heard? Even Gioffre has heard. Have you not? - The pope has died. - You know what that means? I know there will be an election. And the city will be bedlam until it's over. Do you think our father can win, Juan? Are we allowed to dream, Mother? Your father found ways to love and care for us in this house, but I'm not sure as pope he can do the same. As pope, he can do what he wants. Are you sure? Kings and popes and emperors belong to their peoples, not to their families. So, we allow the election to run its course, and he won't be pope. What other course is there? It's in the hands of God. It's in the hands of the College of Cardinals, Mother. It's not quite the same thing. This one. - Cardinal Borgia. - My Lord Cardinal. - Whoever wins this contest-- - Election. If you were a different man... ...I might vote for you. You've performed your duties as Vice-Chancellor admirably. The Church has need of your... ...organizational genius. But... She has other needs as well. And they would be? Honesty. Probity. Goodness. You find me lacking in those qualities? Yes. And so I shall fight you. To the end, and beyond that, if need be, with any means at my disposal. I do tend to win whatever battles I fight. But what talk we of fighting? It is all in God's hands. Good night, My Lord. To Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia, four votes. To Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, six votes. To Cardinal Guilliano Della Rovere, seven votes. To Cardinal Orsino Orsini, six votes. None has the require majority... Dominus Deum... After the death of Pope Sixtus, they holed us up here for a month... Appalling. The company was tolerable, but as for the food... I had to lead the revolt-- insist our dishes could be brought in from outside. How wise. And now there's crystal in my soup. Please, have mine, Your Grace. Oh. Don't drink this. It's vinegar; I've tasted it. From my vineyards in Valencia. How can I thank you? Hmm... I wonder... Mmm! ...est a me... The rules are clear. No outside contact is permitted under any circumstance. But you must know that Cardinal Versucci's digestion is very delicate. Which is why he has rabbit baked in milk. Ah. Good. And... Cardinal Piccolomini... Uh... Suckling pig with rosemary. Indeed. The well-being of the curia... ...is of the greatest importance. As Vice-Chancellor, their health is my concern. Mens sana in corpore sano. I think St. Augustine might disagree with you. He extolled the virtues of fasting. St. Augustine... ...never had to vote in conclave. My dear sons, the Cardinals Versucci, Piccolomini, and Sanso, grant some titles and benefices from the Borgia abbeys, monasteries, and bishoprics. ...Versucci, Piccolomini, and Sanso, grant some titles and benefices from the Borgia abbeys, monasteries, and bishoprics. Julius... Versucci... All rights to the Abbey of... ...St. Catherine of Siena. Cardinal Allesandro Piccolomini. Suckling pig for the cardinal, roasted. Roasted and... ...stuffed. - Cardinal Julius Versucci. - Uh, rabbit. Rabbit... ...baked in milk. Tasty. Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere... ...has garnered ten votes. Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, five. Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia has garnered eight votes. But none has the required majority. My dear son, we are in sight of our goal, but now you must redouble our efforts. Send your brother round the Borgia churches to empty them of gold, ornamen, and precious stone. I have emptied the churches of the Romagna. I have stripped altars bare. They were rotten with gold ornament. Yes, you are a true reformer, brother. These cardinals know no vows of poverty. Why the dove, Cesare? It has a dual purpose, my love. Like many things in life, it serves as both a symbol and a messenger. - A symbol of what? - Of the uncorrupted soul. And a messenger of what? Of corruption. You mean to say it bears news of how many votes we must buy in the Papal election. You are criminally well informed, sis. But I trust your soul is still of the purest white. How many votes must we buy him, Cesare? You know too much already, don't you? You're wrong. I know too little... Dear Father, nine mules laden down with gold and treasure are beig distributed to the palaces of the following cardinals: Cardinal Guiliano Della Rovere has garnered... ...Cardinal Ascana Sforza has garnered four... ...Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia has garnered ten votes. None has the required majority. Of course, Cardinal Sforza, the entire conclave knows that I cannot be both Vice-Chancellor and pope of Rome. Than you can no longer be a Vice-Chancellor. You mean... ...I may yet be pope of Rome? If you can find a suitable Vice-Chancellor. And how would you describe the qualities necessary for a suitable Vice-Chancellor, Cardinal Sforza? - Discretion. - Mm-hmm. Loyalty. And a certain kind of wisdom. Can you be more specific? I would say the one who would be suitable as Vice-Chancellor would be wise to support the Vice-Chancellor who would be pope. Hmm. And I would say... ...we have an understanding. Cardinal Guiliano Della Rovere has garnered seven votes. Cardinal Alberto Colonna, two. Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia... ...fourteen. Cardinal Borgia has the required majority. Correction: Cardinal Borgia has bought the required majority. What is your implication? His implication is that the throne of St. Peter's is for sale. And has been bought by a Spaniard up to his elbows in simony. I see. You would prefer it had been bought by an Italian? By someone remotely worthy of the papacy at least-- Then my first act as pope will be to institute an enquiry into the elective process. My second, of course... ...will be to appoint a Vice-Chancellor-- the greatest office, with the greatest income, in my gift. Now, there are two obvious choices: Cardinals Della Rovere and Orsini. But the pope could not possibly appoint one who questioned his right to be pope. That was not my intention. Nor was it mine. I see. And the Spanish race is closest to your bosom. Can we proceed, then? To conclude: Cardinal Borgia has the required majority An examination, testes et pendentes, is required. And Cardinal Borgia is happy to comply. Can there be any doubt that the good cardinal is male? Not if we count his children. Let him without children cast the first stone. I have heard rumours... ...of a rhinoceros horn. Ooh, that small? Boasting again? Oh, go on. The suspense is killing them. Habet duos testiculos... ...et bene pendentes. So, he's got two testicles, well hung. Deo gracias. Habemus papam! Pater, et lius, et Spiritus Sanctus. Amen. ...tu es et dominus eternum... ...et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Oh! Your sins are all forgiven, sisters. By the pope's bastard? Son! His favourite son! I ask to confess to you, Holy Father, because... I have sinned. How have you sinned, my son? I have corrupted my soul. I have pledged estates, castles, benefices to your brother cardinals. I have transferred the documents in the innards of roasted beasts and fowls. All to secure your election as pope. And God will repay us tenfold. But you must set my soul at ease, Father. Can a family such as ours survive such a prize? We are Spaniards. They hate us. The enemies we have at present will be multiplied tenfold. God will protect his Vicar on Earth, Cesare, and those dearest to him. And will you inform God as to His duties in this regard? Why this blasphemous tone, my son? Because I swear, if God does not protect us, I shall. You are a bishop, Cesare. You have no need of such temporal thoughts. You placed this collar round my neck, Father. You made God my calling. But the sins I've committed for you must convince you, surely, that the Church is not my calling. I beg you now to release me of my vows. Let me live as a layman. As a soldier. I can then protect our family from the storm that surely must engulf it. You are my eldest son, Cesare. You were always destined to be a prince of the Church. I would be a prince of state, Father, and I think you know that. The papal army is small, Cesare. The battles I will fight will be within these sacred walls. This is where I will need your help. Juan can... ...bear arms for the Borgia family, and lead whatever army the pope has, and I will not have my authority questioned further on this. Ego te absolvo ab omnibus censuris, et peccatis, in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. You think it fits me, brother? You have broad shoulders. As have you. Though it lacks an insignia. I thought a cape to cover the breastplate, with the Borgia Bull in bright yellow. I favour black, myself. Black for the cleric, but for the soldier, a prancing bull in yellow. Or red, perhaps? Black. It suits you. - Welcome, Papa. - Oh, I've missed you. - So, you have won. - Yes, I've won. You've won what you always wanted. My congratulations. And I have... lost. - But what have you lost, my love? - You. You'll never lose me. In spirit, maybe, but... in the flesh, I may have to. The pope cannot love? The pope can love God. But to be seen to love anyone else would be... ...unthinkable. So we'll find ways to accommodate our affections. Something like we've always done. All of Rome knows you're the mother to my children. Not only must the pope be chaste; he must be seen to be chaste. The children. You can be seen to love them, no? Of course! I always knew this day would come. As long as you are with me in spirit... - I always will be. - And with no one else. That is equally impossible, Vannozza. So we take vows of chastity along with your new status? Must we take vows of poverty too? Poverty? God forbid! For the ceremonial processio, horses, arms and livery for 700 priests and 23 cardinas with their retinues, knights, and grandees. For Pope Alexander, a ceremonial throne constructed by Florentine master builders, gold and silver plated. For the Borgia family, a brocaded carriage, gold inlaid, refurbished in Venice. You look beautiful, Mother. But you must try to remember you're not in mourning. But perhaps I am. Like you are losing your family? The life we have lived. What are we gaining? The future. â™ª Step! Step! Take the tiara... ...which is ornamented with three crowns... ...and be aware... that you are father of kings and monarchs, lord of the globe, earthly resident of our Lord Jesus Christ, our Redeemer, who shall have the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen. His Holiness, Pope... ...Alexander Sixtus. That is so many titles, Cesare. What will his family call him now? Holy Father. Holy Father. That's easy. Even I can remember that. ...grants to all faithful here present a plenary indulgence... - And tell me, dear brother-- - What, sis? What must I call myself? Holy Daughter? You are still Lucrezia Borgia, my love. You will only change your name when you marry. - And when will I marry? - Never, if I can help it. But surely it is good to marry, Cesare? As the pope's daughter, you will have every prince of Europe vying for your hand. They may care very little for your heart. Perhaps I should do as you have done, brother-- take Holy Orders. Give my heart to God. That might be the safer option, my love. Does Papa have so many enemies? As our father, perhaps not. But as pope... I am Rodrigo Borgia no longer. I am Alexander Sixtus. But you know who you are. My father, still. I am no longer "I". I am... "we". We felt so... alone out there. When the crown touched our head. Humbled, even. Even frightened. You surprise me, Father. You would surprise yourself if such destiny ever brushed against you. Quite alone... ...with just the... ...silence of God... ...as your witness. But He must already be pleased, Holy Father. Ahhh! Indeed? Why? Because the earth has not yet swallowed us. Here we are. You must help me, Cesare. You must help me interpret... ...the great silence of God. Wait! Let me! Come. Help me... do His will. We have been entrusted... ...with the keys to His kingdom. The King of France must be aware, Ambassador, that we have placed the papal mitre in the hands of an ape. He has hopes, Cardinal, that the office brings its own grace with it, and that the grace of God can transform the worst of men. And if it doesn't? We will observe with interest what harm a mitred ape can do. Hm. These offices we grant in the full expectation they will be used wisely for the restoration of the honour of our Holy Mother Church. Dominus vobiscum. - Dominus vobiscum. - And, finally, the greatest office in our gift, the post of Vice-Chancellor, the office that stands a reed's width from our papacy. We grant... ...the most august, the most valued colleague, the brightest hope for the future of the Church, Cardinal... ...Ascanio Sforza. Simony! I charge you now in public with trading sacred offices like a market huckster! May I remind the cardinal he is in consistry. Perhaps we misheard him. That office was promised to me. Ah. Did you pay for it? With my acceptance of your foul election. When the pope pledges to banish all suspicion of simony from the cardinalate, he keeps his word. God has chosen us as a new broom to sweep the Vatican clean of corruption, which is precisely why we choose one who has no expectation of advancement-- Cardinal Sforza. And I pray I may prove worthy of the honour. And I pray so too. In fact, I fully approve of his new... broom. Kiss the ring, you fool. As do I. And I deeply regret my recent intemperance. In honour of his appointment, I invite Cardinal Sforza, and Your Holiness and the College of Cardinals to a banquet at my palace in two days' time. Are you going to share it with me? Share what, Holy Father? Why you bring a monkey to a banquet? Oh, I fear the other cardinals might not share your appetite for reformation. And your monkey does? Why, yes. He is an excellent judge of appetite. Huh! Reform to our Holy Mother Church may happen slowly, but... God has spoken to me as he spoke to my predecessor, Pope Innocent. Happen it must. Shall we dine on gruel tonight, then, Your Holiness? I could inform my cooks. We are your guests tonight, My Lord Cardinal. We will dine according to your choosing. Thank goodness. I can have the wine poured? Let me taste that. It is of an excellent vintage, My Lord. I have no doubt. Oh! And how is his palate? Well, it's superb. He salutes your good taste. Thank you. A great wine, like the papacy itself-- mature, rounded, its roots in the soil, its bouquet in the heavens, consumed by a monkey. I suspect a metaphor is lurking there, My Lord Cardinal? We are but animals blessed with an eternal soul. There go we, but for the grace of God. It seems nature, not metaphor, calls. He begs Your Lordship's pardon. Excuse me. Excuse my monkey. Why such a hurry? My God, you're fast. For a cook. And you for a cleric. On kitchen duty? For tonight. - Who pays you? - Cardinal Orsini. Whatever you're being paid, I'll double it. I could use someone that fast. You could? Oh, yeah. But not that stupid! Far from stupidity, sire. I imagine from your offer that you have need of me, yes? So to kill the servant you have need of would indeed be stupid. Call me stupid, then. Tell me, tell me why I shouldn't. Hmm? Because of the sixth commandment, thou shalt not kill. I'll be forgiven. The pope is my confessor. Because you'll never meet another assassin like me. - Are you sure? - Yes. But we were talking terms, yes? We were. I would gladly work for the pope or the pope's son, for these cardinals can, as you know, prove fickle, and it seems someone as pitiless as you-- - Yes? - Needs someone as pitiless as me. Elaborate. I have smothered infants in their beds. But only when their parents paid me. And in the powder? Eternal life. - For whom? - You. Your father. It's not very subtle. No subtlety needed tonight. They all want you dead. Serve this... ...to Orsini. Your Grace. You are bleeding. Damned monkey bit me. Animals will do that. They lack soul. I propose a toast. To harmony, amongst us, servants of God. - Harmony. - To the communion of saints and the forgiveness of sins. Amen. Amen. I'd like to propose a second toast. To metaphor. - Why metaphor? - Because she's so infinitely pliable. A prince one minute, a monkey the next. And what her hidden meaning is only God in His infinite wisdom knows. I propose another toast. To monkeys. Monkeys? They lick your hand one minute, bite your neck the next. And everyone knows what you do with the monkey that bites you. And what do you do with the monkey that bites you? Your Eminence, you're ill. You wring its neck. - Poison. - Poison! I accuse! The cooks? Come, Father. Send for help! - The poison was meant for us. - That's not possible. We were saved by a monkey, Father. You don't poison the pope! Are you aware what the gossips call you? The mitred ape. Half of Rome was waiting to celebrate this outcome-- You poison a rat, you poison a rabid dog! Not the Vicar of Rome, not the heir to St. Peter! - Bring my carriage! - The idea offends you? It offends me, it offends nature, it offends God Himself! - So, God will take His revenge, then. - Yes, He will. With our help. - Go! - Yah! Excellent service. - I fear it is not over yet. - What do you mean? Well, there's more to your Borgia family than father and son. - What do you mean? - I mean we must hurry, My Lord. Your whole family's in danger. - Micheletto! - Am I too late? - We were waiting for you. - Then you're too late! What are you doing?! Ah! Allow me, Uy Lord. Guards! - General! - With me, quickly! Come on! Get out of my way! Pray somewhere else, Cardinals. Arrest this household. You planned this massacre thoroughly. If I had planned it, My Lord, believe me, we would not be having this conversation. You're that meticulous? Always. And o planned it? Cardinal Orsini. And Della Rovere? I know nothing of him. In this affair, I had but one master. And now? And now I am like a stray dog, masterless. Unless your kind offer still stands. You could have... let things take their course... Betrayed me. Most of your kind do. My kind? I do not have a kind. And I suspect neither do you. Your name, sweet assassin. Micheletto. You must prove yourself worthy of my trust, th. - This is not proof enough? - Perhaps. Perhaps not. Can you dispose of these corpses? You would keep them secret? More than that. I would keep you secret. Dump them in the Tiber. Meet me by the Vatican gates in two hours' time. We shall discuss your future service. Mother. Are you trying to frighten me? I'm sorry, Mother. Why are you here, Cesare? I imagine things-- murders, blood-spattered throats, poisoned chalices. Perhaps you're not wrong. We have many enemies now. And Lucrezia? She's sleeping. You miss her that much? Always. If anything happened to her, I'd... ...I'd die. What could possibly happen? I'm putting a guard on the house. Is it so dangerous outside? We are in a different city now. Is it still called Rome? I'm not sure it has a name. Father. Father! Father, I've had to place a guard on the-- The good cardinal, my son, has been expressing his shock and dismay at this evening's outcome. Poison, it seems, was the cause of Cardinal Orsini's demise. One shudders at the thought. As to who poisoned him, I have no idea. Perhaps we should ask ourselves, who benefits most from his death? And what are you implying, Your Eminence? I am implying nothing. I am merely offering His Holiness any help I can in unmasking the culprit. Our Holy Mother Church can afford no such scandals. We have Orsini's household staff in irons, Your Holiness. Cardinal. The good cardinal, my brother, has offered to help us unmask the culprit behind this plot. We apprehended this wretch skulking outside by the gate. A plot, by definition, needs more than one participant, does it not? Do you recognize him? Didn't he pour the wine? Do you know this man, Cardinal Della Rovere? I know he attended at the cardinal's table, but there were many of those. Beyond that, nothing. If this creature is indeed the poisoner, some hours on the strappado should loosen his tongue. See if he talks. I have a dilemma: whether to flay you at night... ...or at dawn. - I pity you your dilemma, My Lord. - Pity yourself. Brother. You have already exhausted yourself in our father's defence. Now I could spend a good hour questioning this man. Is that really a task for a cleric? Lock the door and go. Up. Up! Would you have talked? Only to sing your praises, My Lord. Still want to earn my trust? Eternally, My Lord. Lie low for a day, then. I can have word sent out that you couldn't be broken. And then? Then... ...get close to Cardinal Della Rovere. Tell me what he thinks. What he plans. Then you must hurt me, My Lord. Haven't I hurt you enough already? To convince this cardinal, my back must tell its own story. And I have heard that he has an interest in the male torso. And even I cannot convincingly whip myself. So whip me, My Lord. Harder. Harder, My Lord. And... ...if you betray me... ...you will end your days on that rack. Then it would not be in my interest to betray you, My Lord. Good. Again! Again. Do you have something to tell me? About the night's events? Only that... ...I will protect you. Protect our family. With my life if needs be. Well, all of the others bought and sold. We merely proved ourselves better at the game. But we draw the line at murder, do we not? Orsini drew no such line. I see. So, we are one less cardinal this morning. I was your age when I became a cardinal. Seems like yesterday. This red... ...signifies that you are ready to spill your blood in defence of the Christian faith. - No, Father. - Are you, my son, ready to spill your blood in defence of the Christian faith? I think you are! For the defence of my family, perhaps. - That too. - Give me control of the papal armies and I will protect us all. We will have one son in the cloth and one in armour. You know our wishes. But a cardinal's red? And Lucrezia must marry. So soon? - She is 14 years old. - She is just a child. We must bind our enemies to us. Make friends of them. And what better way is there than marriage You can perform the rite-- as cardinal. Am I a cardinal already? And they tortured you for... ...how long? A day and a night, Your Eminence. And you revealed? There was nothing to reveal, Your Eminence. Ecce homo. "Behold the man." They scourged our saviour thus. Is it true, what's being rumoured? That the good cardinal inadvertently poisoned himself? Who would have profited from his death? Certainly not Cardinal Orsini. - Who takes possession of his properties? - Borgia. Well, then. These methods are not mine. You think they are mine, Your Eminence? What are your methods? Discretion. Silence. And you have suffered for your silence. Why? Like you, I hate this Borgia. And if I can be of any use... I need someone I can trust. You can trust my hatred of this Borgia pope. I can trust these wounds of yours. They will last for a lifetime, Your Eminence. Indeed. I need to assemble a gathering of every cardinal who shares your feelings. In absolute secrecy. May I thank you, Holy Father, for bequeathing to me your precious time. Go on, my child. I have sinned mightily, Your Holiness, and know there are some sins that only the pope can forgive. They are few, but the most grave. Tell me. My husband, Your Holiness, has long been... ...distasteful to me. I fear... ...you are not the first woman to share that fate. His person I find repellent. His advances sicken me. His hand upon my body makes me retch with disgust. Have you denied him... ...your duties as a wife? No, Your Holiness. I performed them as the Church says I must. So I... ...fail to discern the sin. I found myself with child. The thought of this body of mine, marred by the presence of his offspring-- inside-- drove me to an act of transgression that... Go on, my daughter. I put an end to my pregnancy. That is indeed most grave. A sin... ...that only the pope... ...can forgive. Only God may forgive. But we may intercede... ...on your behalf. Then, please, Your Holiness, ...beg for me His mercy. And... ...your husband? He knows of this? He knows nothing. He has retired to his castle in Bassano. He satisfies his lust on me no longer. And you are... now... chaste? I have no one, Your Holiness. Then perhaps that is to be your penitence-- to follow your husband to Bassano, as is your duty. I would prefer a life of destitution, Your Holiness. Then love God. And find peace within the walls of a nunnery. Can one find peace in such a love, Your Holiness? It is what we must do, Giulia Farnese. I fear I may lack Your Holiness's will. I am still young, Your Holiness, and my body, I am sure, could find, and give, much happiness if my soul could find peace. Do you beg forgiveness from God for the enormity of your crime? I do so daily. Your Holiness, my soul yearns for its punishment. Then you must fast. From matins till evensong. And flagellate your naked body twice nightly. With knotted cord, Your Holiness? Cord of silk will suffice. To destroy the beauty the Lord has granted you would be to compound your sin. E go te absolve... ...ab omnibus censuris, et peccatis, in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. - Amen. - Amen. Giulia Farnese. Your Holiness? One of your lineage... ...to be destitute-- we cannot allow it. We must find you... some... ...temporary and... ...temporal refuge. Keep the fire away from the straw! - It is! - Good! - Boy, keep the banners and colours all together. - Right, sir! Some of you voted for him, for which unfortunate choice you are now forgiven. But most of you voted against. We have assembled the barest of majorities. But then, this Borgia pope was elected with just such a majority. The cardinal's demise was... sudden. So it seems. But his palace is ideal as a... ...place of penitence... ...and... ...self-reflection. If it can be proven, what many of us suspect-- corruption, simony, the blatant sale of the sacred offices, and worse, the utter degradation of the office of the papacy in the eyes of the Christian world... You must think of your sojourn here as a retreat. A retreat? The cardinal had this tunnel built. It leads inside the Vatican walls. If you ever find yourself in need of... ...spiritual comfort.. ...in your loneliness... Your Holiness. You must not be afraid to avail of it. Day or night. We shall leave you now. This passage goes both ways. Your Holiness must feel free to visit... ...if God's love were ever to leave him wanting. The cardinal summons me in the dead of night. Is there a reason? These are turbulent times, Father. Dottore... You can leave us now. I need advice, dottore, on a delicate matter. The deposition of a pope. Delicate indeed. And, if I may say so, dangerous. Stop that. You have done penance enough. Who then will forgive us, Your Holiness? God will. Huggucio of Pisa states: "Ecce publico fornicator, publico habet concubinem..." The pope who publicly fornicates, publicly keeps a concubine-- Can indeed be deposed, because to scandalize the Church is in itself heresy. But one would need firm evidence of notorious and public lechery. Whose bed is this? Yours, of course. Whose bed was this? It belonged to a cardinal and a fool. What kind of fool? The kind of fool who doesn't understand that God's work can be done even by the most unlikely of his servants. And that Rome needs now is-- You. Power. You're so beautiful, Giulia Farnese. I would have you painted. - She is beautiful. - She is. More beautiful than your painting. - I've just begun. - You must do better, then. Her hair curls, here. Who is she? Giulia Farnese. At your service. Why is he painting you, Giulia Farnese? Your father, the pope, commissioned him. Will he paint one of me? I will commission him, now. Why are you holding a baby goat? It will become a unicorn. Then I want a unicorn. Or even better, a sea horse. I want to lie on a bed of seashells and have a sea horse in my lap. Like this one? Yes. Just like this one. You must have it, then. I can? It's a gift. From Giulia to Lucrezia. - Can I kiss you, then? - Only if we are to be friends. We are friends already. I am to have my portrait painted, Mama. - You are? - But I don't want a goat, or a unicorn. I told Giulia I want a sea horse like this one. - You told who? - Giulia Farnese. Giulia Farnese is having her portrait painted? By Pinturicchio. Papa commissioned him. Ah. She gave me this pendant. I think a sea horse is better than a unicorn, don't you Mama? I've heard she is beautiful, this Giulia Farnese. - Papa thinks so. - I am sure he does. A different type of beauty to yours, Mama. Not Spanish. Italian. Her hair is light, and full of curls. And where did you meet her, Lucrezia? In Papa's rooms. In the Vatican. - Please, My Lady! - Your Holiness! My dear. You told me that the pope can love God, but to be seen to love anyone else would be impossible. Your Holiness-- - Now, now-- - Shall we remove ourselves? That the pope must be chaste, and he must be seen to be chaste. Don't you want them to hear? That you have a new whore?! - Mother! - Farnese! - Get out! - That you've installed her in the Orsini Palace? What? - We were-- - Be gone! I banished my husband for your sake! You are the mother of my children! You will always have a special place in my life. - What about your promise?! - There is no one... ...no one, closer to me than you. Why her?! She was in need! I had to help her. You were destitute once! Be gone! Out! We were in consultation-- Your Grace, are leaving. Don't lie to me. To me, you cannot lie. Then don't challenge me. And never, ever within these sacred walls. I've dreamed about this room and what it might do to you. We need a new understanding, then. Perhaps. I'll keep my peace. But I won't be humiliated. I would have peace. You commissioned a portrait of her. I shall have a portrait too by the same new genius you found. Pinturicchio. He is good, but he's... ...expensive. All of Rome is yours for the taking. Make sure he does me justice. I was beautiful once, no? You still are. We agreed, did we not, that you would not lie? He has placed his new whore in Orsini's palace, no? I believe so, Your Eminence. Question the staff, then, in secret, and in any way you see fit. We need evidence of lechery, fornication-- publico habet concubinem. Get these to the Deacon- Cardinal for signatures. Yes, Your Eminence. He has met in secret with those cardinals that hate your father. With Johannes Burchard, he is making a case for your father's deposition. On what grounds? Notorious and public lechery... Lechery? My father? God forbid. Has he evidence? He means to find it. Then perhaps we should find it first, and silence it before it speaks. Your mother was somewhat troubled yesterday. She finds the change in our life difficult. So I noticed. Do what you can to keep her out of here. It would help, maybe, if you were more discreet in your affections. But I-- You are aware, Holy Father, of the plots against you? Oh, what would Rome be without a good plot? The College of Cardinals is split down the middle. What? Well, perhaps we need some more cardinals. Johannes Burchard has been asked for an opinion... Dear old Johannes. He does give excellent opinion. On your deposition, Father. Indeed. There are certain things I could speak of... ...for a price. Don't worry. You'll get paid. I would need to be. I have seen things within these walls that would shock a brace of courtesans. Well, now, there's no need to shock a courtesan, is there? A brace of cardinals, perhaps. You were asked for a judgement, I believe, some nights ago? Your Holiness, as an expert on canon law, when asked for a judgement, I must provide it. Please sit. I would have your opinion, then, dear Johannes, on the expansion of the College of Cardinals. It is the pope's prerogative to appoint whom he wishes, Your Holiness. To whatever number he wishes? Ah, well, how many cardinals did His Holiness have in mind? How many would be needed to make it safe for our papacy? - Oh, dear. - Come, come, Johannes. You must be aware of the plots against us? You could even, if viewed with an unkind eye, be seen to be party to them. When asked for an opinion, Your Holiness, you know that I must provide it. Ah. So, your opinion, then. How many new cardinals to preserve our papacy? Umm... A baker's dozen, I would say. Mm! Thirteen! And we can appoint them all at once? Without the vote of conclave? Such a great number would need a precedent. Oh. Find one, then. Your Holiness. I have received advice from our most supreme expert in canon law, that a pope's election may be overturned if we can provide evidence of lechery, both notorious and public. That evidence I present to you now. Leave us, Micheletto. And now, my dear, tell us what you have witnessed. There is a passage, connecting the palace to the Vatican. His Holiness makes use of it... nightly. And then? He enters her bedroom while she chastises herself. And I blush to even describe what happens next. Spare us nothing. I wanted seashells and a sea horse. But you have a sea horse, my love. No, I mean a real one. Like your goat. But real sea horses are tiny, my love. - Am I your love? - I would dearly love you to be. My mother hates you. You will learn, my dear, as women, we control so little of our destiny. Men do. And? The outcome is, we hate each other. But we should not. Who should we hate, then? Men? No, my love. It's in our nature to love them. But we should protect ourselves against them. Against our feelings towards them. We will all of us, one day, be replaced. Are you giving me instruction? - Would you like me to? - I think I would. What weapons do I have with which to protect myself? Your beauty. - Is that a weapon? - It can be deadly, when well used. But beauty doesn't last forever. Gone, like the snows of last year. - What else? - When beauty fades? Your wit. Your intelligence. - And I have those weapons? - Oh, in abundance. You should cultivate them. You will be married some day. You may need them-- sooner than you think. Is she pretty, this piece of evidence? She has her charms, My Lord. Perhaps you could see that she takes a vow of silence. Would God forgive us, Micheletto? I know not the ways of God, My Lord. But you know the ways of silence. And we decree bullfighting will be permitted within the walls of Rome on public festivals and the last Thursday of every month. And, finally, the main business to hand. Cardinal Della Rovere needs no staff today, understand? For a day of meditation, he has requested peace and silence. You can tell the others. Have you not heard? His Eminence needs no staff today. It is a day of meditation. - He has much on his mind. - Too much, some might say. Such is the burden of great office. Until tomorrow, my friend. We wish to announce our decision to expand the College of Cardinals, in view of the crippling workload placed upon it by our restructuring of the affairs of our Holy Mother Church. Thirteen new servants of God... ...will receive the cardinal's biretta. Thirteen?! We have judged it wise to strengthen the College of Cardinals, given the enemies who have wormed their way within the Church of Rome. This is against all precedence. His Holiness will fill the College with his favourites. I accuse His Holiness-- Ohhh! Of what are we now accused? Of an offence against canon law. Against the Law of our Holy Mother Church. Canon law? But we have taken advice from the most eminent of all of our canon lawyers. Apple... ...or peach? Peach, I think. I like peach. Eat it all. The Council of Constance is most clear on this matter. I refer you to Statute 42, Paragraph 3-- In brief, I pray. His Holiness, the pope, may expand the College to any number he deems appropriate, if the burden of work necessitates-- I challenge him to name them now! Your Holiness. Oh... Dottore, if you would be so kind. And His Holiness comes behind the Lady Giulia thus! With the force of a stallion. The Bishop of Lucca, His Grace Fiorentini, will be named Cardinal Fiorentini. The Bishop of Naples, His Grace Giovanni Mascoli, will be named Cardinal Mascoli. The Bishop of Valencia, His Grace Cesare Borgia, will be named Cardinal Borgia. The pope would make his son a cardinal? I warn you, I have evidence that will bring this house crashing down around your ears. Evidence? Of lechery, transgressions, both public and notorious! Why, then, Cardinal, you must present it. I will! The... Bishop of Lyon... Though whether the Holy Father is as virile as you... Surely he is. Only God can tell. A candle, if you please! Where is everyone? Is there nobody about? Dear Lord, I pray for your strength and guidance in the trials to come. Give us some sign that Rome will be purified, the Borgia stain will be banished forever-- Guards! Guards! Somebody! Anybody! Help! Was the good cardinal known for lechery? He was discreet in his affections, My Lord. So discreet, indeed, he asked me to clear the house of servants yesterday. He must have had lecherous intentions, then. But I'm... shocked that they ended in murder. And now he's fled, My Lord. I would recommend discretion in this matter. The Church of Rome can ill afford another scandal. Perhaps he desired her silence, My Lord. He must have. Poor girl... Whom can one trust, in this Rome of ours? I believe trust needs to be earned, My Lord. Perhaps. And perhaps it has been. â™ª -- sync, corrected by elderman -- www.tvsubtitles.net Downloaded From www.AllSubs.org
