 -Hello. -What do you think you're doing? Sleep well? What time is it? -Nine a.m. -Oh, crud. I fell asleep. It was my night, Bill. I made stuffed cabbage. Our DVDs came in. -We'll make it up. -We couldn't find you anywhere. I came this close to calling the hospitals. -My car's in the driveway. -But you were missing. -lt could've been an emergency. -I'm sorry. I'm swamped. I had three days of work crammed into one night.

 I was tired. Don't take it so personally. I'm late. -Christmas, Bill. Orders in by tomorrow. -Yeah, I know. Mr. Henrickson, Rotary keynote and V.A. flag raising at 6 a.m. -Thanks, Lisa. -That's Leslie. -Oh, sorry, Leslie. -She'll get better. -Bill, Christmas. -I know. CPSC banned importation of Santas from that Shendu factory. -Yeah. -Slave labor or asbestos or mercury. I don't know. Tomorrow's the deadline for the alternate source in Malaysia. Well, go Malaysia. I looked at those Weber contracts till 2 a.m. I can't wait to be on the other side of this deal.

 It's just eating up time I don't have. Hollis and Selma Green are very fond of corporate gifting. Hollis and Selma Green are products of a limited gene pool. They're not so bad in an "enemy of my enemy is my friend" kind of way. They are all over Roman like an army of fire ants. You aren't talking to them, are you? Well, I gotta hang tough until Roman gets rid of them. A couple more jabs, he won't be able to resist striking back. We'll have Weber, Greens will be gone. We are this close to the Promised Land. -Hi, hon. I can't talk right now. -I need to ask you something. Okay, sweetie. Make it quick. You skipped out on my night. Honey, let's not make a federal case out of it. But it was my night that you skipped. -lt doesn't mean anything. -lt was the second time. -Are you angry with me about something? -No. You're reading too much into it. Because you didn't skip Margie's night or Barb's. I understand, Nicki. I'm coming home for lunch. We'll talk then. But I really gotta go. -Give me that can, Frank. -I'm hungry, Lois. Give me back my peas. Look here. -Delicious. -Step away from that pot. I'm sure there's more somewhere. Oh, gee, I guess not. I wonder where all those peas went, Lois. Kind of ridiculous place to hide money, wouldn't you say? Appears you got a bunch of big spenders down there... ...at that Laundromat dump of yours. Frank, I really must appeal to you as a respected spouse-- I got 22,000 in peas. You want any of it back, you bring me something worth more. -I don't have any more. -You're a criminal. We both know you're not smart enough... ...to be the brain behind this entire operation. You're gonna tell me where it came from. You're gonna get me a piece and you are gonna make it snappy. Last night, sleeping in the basement wasn't planned. But I do need a break. I'm overwhelmed at work. Pre-Christmas orders need to be in... ...breaking in a new secretary, employee reviews.... I'm proposing that l... ...take each seventh night off. For myself. To rest. I wanna look you in the eye and let you know there's nothing behind it. Everything's fine. I just need a break... ...and, well, I know you all will support me on this. Okay? He just wants a night off. -We get nights off, why shouldn't he? -You don't get it, Margene. Now, all the demands that Barb places on Bill? Everything has to be so perfect. A classic first-wave control freak. What? What do you think this is really about? She's gotten out of hand. We'll only ever get two nights a week. I just wish I knew what was behind it. Did either of you notice anything off with him? I mean before all this? What do you mean? Just... ...anything... ...marital, or...? No. When he works hard, you know, he's tired. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, seventh night off. Excuse me. Barb, I no longer want any more nights after Margene. And that's final. She's the reason. She exhausts him with all of her demands. He's never needed time off for Christmas orders before. I don't buy it. I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. You fight the good fight, Barb. I've been so bad about keeping in contact with the folks from the old ward. -Are you still...? -Still bishop. There was talk of stake president but honestly: I'm just an overgrown deacon. So Sandy. Bill's business is growing, so.... Sister Henrickson, your son Ben came to me twice in the last month. We were supposed to meet again on Sunday. But he never showed up. -I'm sorry, I didn't know. -It's okay. I don't mind. He was looking for help with things he said were hard to talk about here at home. -What was it? -It's not my place to say. But you and Bill need to ask him about it as soon as possible. Barb, I looked up your records to find where you live now. They indicated you're inactive. I can't tell you how much that surprised me. We.... We get so busy, and the church here just.... Just didn't suit us. Barb? Thinking we should give Nicki Tuesday night. She needs it. -Hello. -This is Bishop Devry. From our old ward. This is my neighbor Margie. I live right next door. Pleasure to meet you, Margie. Barb, I'll be back at my house. I'll talk to Ben. Bill and I will talk to Ben. I should get back to dinner now. -ls your family okay, Barb? -It's fine. We all have our challenges. Barb... ...if Bill is unable to righteously lead his son and this family... ...I want you to know you're welcome to return to my ward. Frank found my peas and cleaned me out. Okay, what did you tell him? He won't give them back until we give him a cut. -Of what? -Some of our stash. What do--? There' s no "our stash." No. There's your stash, there's my stash, but.... Did you tell him that there was an "our stash"? Not yet, but we're partners, Eddie, so you just give him a cut of yours. I gave all of mine to Bill. -This is not a bottomless well, Lois. -Well, what did you give it to Bill for? It's a business investment. One, may I remind you... ...that I gave you a chance to get in on. Here comes Chiquita Banana and her cast of thousands. Well, welcome to Lois'. -What kind of business? -I told you. Gambling machines. Look, I will take care of you, Lois. That machine's busted, senorita. Use the one at the end. Look, you tell Bill you need your money back. I don't want it back. This is the first opportunity I've had in years. Why do you wanna screw this up for me? I've got seven new machines coming COD... ...and I need to pay rent ASAP. Now, I'll give you a piece of this-- No way. No, you won't blow this for me. I'm sorry that Frank took your stash. Okay? That's between you and Frank. And you married beneath you. You married trash. And we've been paying for it ever since. Margie, can you give us a minute? -You have something you wanna tell us? -No. Something you wanted to tell Bishop Devry? -I don't know what you're talking about. -Don't lie. -I'm not lying. -Ben, he was here. Well, he's an idiot. There's nothing. -What? -You sent him into our homes... ...with no warning. You owe us an explanation. He doesn't know anything about who we really are. I'm sorry. Let me talk to him. Alone. -Bill-- -I know. I'll get to the bottom of it. What did you go to him for? I can wait here all day. He was just gonna help me. With what? I've been doing it for months now. I tried to stop. But I can't. I love her too much. I'm a deviant. What kind of deviant? Sexual, mostly. Well, what are we talking about here? Like hands? What base, Ben? Everything. -All of it. -Do you know what all of it means? All of it. -I'll get better. -Ben... ...it's not an unnatural desire, but... ...it's the most unholy thing you can do with your body. That's your temple, son. You're gonna stop seeing her. -Can't I tell you my side? -No, Ben. There's-- There's nothing to discuss, I'm sorry. In the future... ...you'll come to me to talk about these things, not that bishop. You don't even listen to me. -You don't care about what I think. -Don't you ever say that to me. You know what, Dad? I liked it. I liked it and I don't wanna stop. You're grounded, Ben. You go to work, you come home. No phone, no computer. Indefinitely. End of story. -Did you know anything about this? -Which part? You and I will sit down to talk, understood? I'm always right here, Dad. He can't live without her. That is pathetic, Margie. If Ben did that to a girl where I come from... ...he'd be driven out to the 1 5 and dumped by the side of the road. Nicki, can I tell you a secret? If you must. I lost my virginity at 1 6 too. That's hardly a secret, Margie. I just think there's room to relax a little about this. Margie... ...physical intimacy is for procreation, not recreation... ...and certainly not for idle gossip. You already have a bun in the oven, so I suggest you cool off. Nicki, are you and Bill not...? Margie, if Bill's too overwhelmed to have anything intimate with me... ...then I feel sure he's too stressed out to have anything meaningful with anyone. -lf that's what you need to tell yourself. -You helped create the situation. Your neediness is overwhelming. I'm the most stress-free of any of us. Don't think he won't replace us if you two keep pushing. Your father cleaned me out, Bill. I have sacrificed my whole life. Shared everything. I just want this one thing. Is that too much to ask? How much did he take? Approximately $30,000. $30,000? Off that little Laundromat? In five weeks? It was a surprisingly well-situated location. -Did you file a police report? -No. I can't, exactly. Eddie, he got us our start-up money... ...and it wasn't entirely on the up-and-up. He got 1.2 million from this woman who had cancer. -Got? -Well, he took it. -As in stole? -More or less. He told me she was dead. I didn't know. He said we needed to clean it up so we wouldn't have to pay taxes. Kind of a loophole thing. You're laundering $1.2 million? Just to avoid taxes. Estate taxes. -You said it was stolen. -Yes, but she was dead. Though it turns out now she isn't. But anyway, now I'm running the Laundromat. It's a good, solid little business. But the 5 percent that Eddie cut me in on, Frank took it all. And I really need it back so I can buy new washers or I'll go belly-up. So you need to give Eddie his money back. It's good. Gambling, Bill? This is Eddie, leave a message. Hi, Eddie. Sold Western Press, huh? -Don't tell him I'm here. -Mom's here. Sounds like you're up to your old tricks, robbing old ladies blind. Why am I not surprised? -You compromised me. -I just wanna be where the action is. Will you hang that up? -Hang up. -Call me as soon as you get this. Why can't you give up this gambling business? You have plenty of other businesses. This is to protect my family. You give up yours. I will not let the men in my life conspire to take this away from me. Not this time. Maybe we should send him back to seminary. We could look into Don's church. -Wait, wait, wait. Wait. -Wait? Yeah, okay, okay, wait. Okay, wait. Bill... ...if any other married couple started asking for a night off-- No, listen, listen, listen. -I mean couples therapy. -Do we have to talk about this now? Does it mean more time away from the kids too? Honey, you get four or five nights a week to catch up. I just need one right now, just for a while. Wait, one night off-- One night off is one thing... ...but the fact that you need it scheduled on a consistent basis-- Please don't be this way. I don't get to hunt or fish anymore. Well, if you can't juggle everything then you should let something else go. -Not your wives. -Well, there's nothing to let go. You know, I spend all day trying to keep ahead of the eight ball. You don't have to take over Utah. You don't have to beat Wal-Mart for us. We don't need it. Well, somebody's gotta bring home the bacon. -And the bacon and the bacon. -Downtime is one thing... ...a night off is different. This is what you signed up for. I want it put on the schedule so it's official... ...and no one gets hurt like last night. -So it is about one of us. -No. I'm not asking for the moon. Please, just schedule it. -lf you don't, I'll pick the night myself. -Fine. You don't want to share a bed with us. -Why are you being like this? -I'm sleeping on the couch... ...until you're ready to shoulder the responsibilities you signed up for. You want some alone time, you can have it. -What are you doing? -I'm gonna sleep with my wife. Not this one, Bill. You have to leave, it's Barb's night. -She wants to talk to you, she told me. -I know. That's why I'm here. Well, that's not right. Sometimes I just need a minute to catch my breath. And that's what I am, where you go to catch your breath? To a certain extent. -Why do you love me? -Oh, honey, don't. Am I the one it's easy to have sex with? The play toy? Would Ana have been the next one? You know my feelings for you go deeper than that. I know what sex is about, Bill... ...and it's at least a little about newness. What if I become too familiar? I'm not gonna be new forever. Familiar? Honey. Honey. That's not possible with you. Not ever. This is not a talking issue. I hate talking about things too. I hate it more. What do you like? When you please me. That's naughty, Margie. You're a naughty girl. Yes, my darling? I've been having a little bit of difficulty getting you your money. But I really need my peas. So I'm willing to offer you... ...something else that you've been wanting. And just what that might be? I'll let you come in the back door. That? That was one night, 30 years ago. You're still thinking about that? Come on, if I want an old caboose, I'll call Union Pacific. You're an exciting woman, but for 22 thou for that old caboose? Oh, of course. Hoochie coochie music. I get it, that's rich. Sit. Sit. Sit. I'll give you something of value. I'll tell you exactly where that money went. Our son took it all. Every last bit. You should be ashamed of yourself. For emasculating our husband like that. -What are you talking about? -I saw what you did last night. I saw you push him down there. Push him down where? Let's just say you should close your curtains at night. There are young children living in these houses. -How dare you? -Trust me, Margie, I wish I hadn't seen it. It wasn't pretty. I wish I didn't know the things you force our husband to do. I have to drag him back up just to give me a turn. Men hate that. -Forcing Bill into that depraved behavior? -There's nothing wrong... ...with getting a little oral, Nicki. I'm sure Barb has him do it too. Well, why don't we just ask her then? I will not discuss this with Barb. You are a sex addict, and you're bringing our men down with you. And I fully suspect that you knew all about Benny and that blonde whore. Should we tell Barb about that too? Nicki was staring in my house last night. Were you doing something you weren't supposed to? What? I am not mad this time. But it can't happen again. If it's my night, it's my night. -He insisted. -Well, you can say no. -Don't bet on it. -Listen, both of you. If I don't want to sleep with him on my night, he sleeps alone. And until he gives in on this seventh night business... ...he gets the cold shoulder from all of us. Why do I have to suffer because of you two? Margie, you have free will here. But if you ever want us to back you up in the future, you'll do this. It's only fair. Selma and I have sent you another token of our fraternal esteem. Thank you, Hollis. Thank you for the information. The coal mine was a soft target. We sent Roman's illegal alien workers running. Without them, his unit labor costs will skyrocket. Next, take a look at his irrigation pipe company. He employs 1 2, 1 3-year-old compound boys, off the books, no salary, to lay pipe. Like peanut butter on toast... ...Roman spread himself too thin. Too bureaucratic. Not nimble, Bill. -Hang on a sec, honey. - Your brotherhood... ...means a great deal to me and Selma after our years alone in the wilderness. We're a good fit. Thanking you for your wise counsel, respectfully, Hollis Green. By the way... ...what kind of spam filters do you use to keep your systems open? I.... I don't know. I'll have to get back to you on that. Hi, Margie. We're all supposed to give you the cold shoulder until you give in. Like "cold" cold. Freezing cold. Whose idea was that? I wouldn't feel right coming right out and telling you. -Was it Barb? -Okay, yes. And Nicki's going along with it, but I think she can be turned. Are you on board? I don't wanna be. Hey, Bill. -Yes? -Why don 't you please Nicki? What are you talking about? Why don't you please her? I believe that's between her and me, don't you think? I know that she says she doesn't want it, but she does. She really does. Margie, that's more than enough. Okay, Bill. Remember, I didn't tell you a thing. I love you. Benny... ...just because we don't go to church like we used to, l-- I don't want you to think that I don't still believe that those values are true. That they're... ...so very important. I know. I do too. And... ...I want you to know that... ...if you need to talk to someone... ...I just need you to talk to your father about these things first. It's important to me. I don't know if I can. I'll make sure that he makes the time. It's not that. He doesn't think I'm worthy. Not like an oldest son. Oh, Benny. Benny, you are our pride and joy. Mom... ...I'm still the same person. I know you are. I'm not ruined inside. I promise. I know, Benny. -What the heck are you doing here? -You and I got business to discuss. You and I have nothing to discuss. -Bill, you want me to get somebody? -Sit down. Shut up. Don, stay. No, you stay, Don. Have a seat, Don. So you're up to your old fun and games with that cocksucker Eddie. -I don't know what you're talking about. -Oh, no you don't. No sirree. Your loving mother sang like a canary. You have built your entire new gambling business... ...on the back of stolen money from a dead woman. Repeat. -I don't know what you're talking about. -It's embezzlement. It's illegal. And it's a business that can be crushed like that. Tied to liens, attachments... ...it's criminal. Now... ...your father has a deep sense of justice. -Get out. -Cut me a check. I wouldn't give you a nickel. A percentage of your business. Look, come on, we can be in business together, you and me. We can finally turn that corner. -You're pathetic. -ls everything okay? Hey there, pappy. I'm his father. The man's a vagrant, take him out. He's not allowed on the premises again. We're not through here, Sonny Jim. Not by a long shot. He's crazy. He doesn't know what he's saying. You think he's pieced together our Weber Gaming is the same Roman was after? I don't know. You need to get to Roman before he does. Maybe it's time we cut loose our Green boys. Yeah, good idea. Leave the blame on them... ...or this house of cards will go down. -Roman. -So what's on your mind, Bill? It's Hollis and Selma Green. They paid me several visits. They've asked me to.... To spy on the UEB. Offered me inducements. They think they can exploit the problems that you and I have had. And they're making a grab for our companies. -Can I get you anything? -We'll have two butterscotch sundaes... -...and two 7Ups. -Yep. Butterscotch is homemade. Roman, they're erratic and potentially dangerous. You know that. They said they're going to attack your irrigation company tonight. How's my daughter? She's well, Roman. Look after her, Bill. I'll take care of the Greens. Thank you for bringing it to my attention. You can't turn my wives against me. Don't assume I have any idea what your other wives are up to. Don't assume you got them wrapped around your thumb. -Margene. -Don't. No, you can't pick us off one by one. If one of us is unhappy, we're all unhappy. Hi. Bill. Give it up. He told me. -Bill? -I didn't. Oh, you. -So you sticking with Barb on this? -What do you mean "with Barb"? -We all speak for ourselves. -Really? Since when? Bill, I started with seven nights. Then down to three and a half. Now it's two and change. I'm not going down a minute farther. Barb, that's not practical. What happens when we bring on a fourth wife? You get a fourth wife, she better sleep in the basement too... ...because she's not getting any of my nights. What are you saying about this family? I am drawing a line about how much time I need with my husband. -Barb. -You can't dictate to me. I need you to give me a schedule with a night off. Until then, if you need me, well... ...I'll be downstairs. Fine then, Bill. Just cut and run. -On my nights too? -Well, talk to Barb about it. If you all wanna stick together on this, then-- You sold me out, and now you're cutting me off. No, it's fine. Have fun in your basement. She's right. Go to your room. I catch anyone down there, they're dead. -Aggressive in this quarter. -Urgent call for you, Bill. -Bill here. -Please hold one moment... ...for Hollis Greene. Bill Henrickson, you disappoint. You have betrayed us. You urged Roman to attack us. I did no such thing. Do you swear to that? Do you? -I've no gripe with you, Hollis. -You stand in the way of our ascension. We invoked your name to protect ourselves... ...and were told of your involvement. You sold us out. We will seek revenge. Full stop. Hollis, your actions alone led to this. We were dragged from our factory, I was beaten... ...the men you sent manhandled our wives... ...they humiliated my brother, Selma. I'm sorry, I had no idea. You have 24 hours to manumit... ...all your business interests over to us, fully. You will personally submit to us tomorrow morning. At Meineke, at exit 5300 south. At noon o'clock. We went too far, Bill. They know where I live. I'm stepping in here. We're going to Lee Hatcher. Not now, Leslie. Mr. Henrickson, your uncle is down in the parking lot. Calm down? I'm up to my neck in the Greens. You're telling me I bought a company with money stolen from a not-dead woman. -No one knows. -Frank knows. He knows we bought the company with illegal money. Compliments of you and your loving sister. Now he is this close from figuring out the Weber part. Gosh. This wasn't some teen romp, Eddie. All I want is a life like yours: normal. If you wanna make this right, you'll leave from here. You won't contact any of us. I'll protect the business. You've got to disappear. -What about my money, Bill? -Oh, you'll get your money back-- If this thing pans out. --no interest. Get yourself out of Utah. Ben, no, stop. Stop. All night I kept thinking about what I'd do if you died in a major car crash... ...or went missing or moved away before I saw you again. Your family hates me now. They don't understand yet. They will. -I want us to get married. -Wait. What do you mean? Don't-- Don't think of it like other people think of it. It wouldn't have to change anything. Here. -Where did you get that? -From my mom. It doesn't have to change our relationship at all. It would just make it moral. That is no reason to get married. Not like that. I mean moral for my mom and dad. Everything else could stay the same. I don't want anything to change either. -What? -Where were you? -I was at work. -You left two hours ago. Come in here. -I have something to say first. -Sit down. Were you with Brynn? Mom... ...I want you to know that I've dedicated myself to never live in sin again. I wanna be pure. I want her to be pure with me. I've asked Brynn to marry me. And she said yes. -You're too young, Ben. -Says who? In Smith's time, kids were married at our age. Well, nowadays you need my permission. There's no way you're getting it. You'll be the one standing in the way of our eternal salvation. -lf you want that on your back-- -Benny, stop. Just look at me. -You have so much ahead of you. -No, Mom. Just don't. No. You have no idea at this point in your relationship if she's the one for you. I know. I know I'm young and I thought about all that first. She might not be the one but she's the one for right now. And later on, if I fall in love with someone else... ...there can be a second one. My second wife. Benny, go to your room. -Mom? -Ben, go. -He doesn't know what he's saying. -This is all your fault. You're around but you're not here lately. He told me that any time he's with you, he feels unworthy. If he feels that way with you... ...how do you think he feels when you're overtly absent? -I'll talk to him. -No. You'll fix this. This is not the life I want for him. It's set. ATF offices at 9 a.m. When I mentioned the Greens, they became very interested. -They must have an active file. -One minute. -They can do it by noon? -It's the ATF. They're locked and loaded. They can move fast if you give them the right details. I'm not sure it's wise to go to the cops, Lee. You'd rather have crazies and firebombs going through your store... -...or your living room window? -ls there anything he can't say? Just tread lightly, Bill. Okay? Get some sleep. Nine a.m. sharp. Will do. Good night, Lee. Thanks, Don. Come in. -Boys asleep? -Not yet. Can I trust you won't tell Barb and Marge I came to you? What is it? If this thing about you having a night off is only about me... ...then I want you to know that on my nights I can sleep in the boys' room. You can have alone time. It'll be our secret. You don't have to take this out on Barb and Margie... ...if you don't desire me. Hey. Hey. I want you to have everything Barb and Margie have... ...and much more. Okay. What are you doing? Try and relax. -Stop it. -What? Is that what you need to make you happy, Bill? -ls it what you need to make you happy? -No. I like it the way we usually do it. Face to face. Just feels wrong when you're far away like that. -ls that okay? -Yeah. You're a very, very good girl. When I married Bill... ...I thought it was just going to be him and me. Oh, I loved him so much. I couldn't imagine having to share that love with anyone else. When Nicki came along... ...it was the hardest moment of my entire life. I cared for her. She took care of me when I needed it the most, when I was really sick. But learning to love her took a long time. Learning to share my love for Bill is something I still struggle with. I wouldn't change it for the world now... ...but I didn't know it was the marriage I was getting into. Polygamy is a hard life. I think you deserve to know what I didn't. Now, if you decide you still want it... ...all I can say is you need to really be onboard. How many wives do you have? I was thrown out of Juniper Creek when I was 1 4 years old. I'm not like them. Roman Grant is corrupt. The Greens are erratic and immoral. -I'm not-- -This was in Mexico. Those are their own brothers. Your amoral little bedmates... ...are homicidal. We're working with Mexican authorities to bring them in. I had no idea. What do you need me to do? Tell me when and where you're meeting them and you'll escort me there. My client won't be put in harm's way. He's already put his neck on the line to bring you this information. A little respect. Just because you drive a nice car and live in Sandy... ...doesn't mean you're any different than any of them in my eyes. Ma'am, you're not from Utah, are you? No, I'm from Boston. And where I come from, you're all the same. Mormons, LDS, polygamists. You can't just wrap it up in God and make it okay. Never step out of Utah. Because my great-grandpa never had eight wives. So I feel no guilt putting you behind bars. And what religion were you raised in? -That's none of your business. -Exactly. You want the Greens? Fine. Get out a piece of paper and start writing. She can't just go and do this. She can't say something like that and make it up. Stop it, Ben. If you have a shred of an idea that you want number two... ...you have to tell me. It's only fair. -No. I don't. -Then why did you say it? I just wanted them to stop. To leave us alone. Its okay, Ben. It just came out. I understand. It's the only kind of family you know.
