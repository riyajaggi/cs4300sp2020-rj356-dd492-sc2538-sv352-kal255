 I LIKE THE IDEA OF A BOAT, BUT WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH IT? DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW TO DRIVE IT? WHAT'S THIS DO -DAD, WHERE ARE THE BRAKES? -IT DOESN'T HAVE BRAKES,HONEY. WELL THEN, HOW DO YOU MAKE IT STOP? WELL, YOU DROP THE ANCHOR. I LOVE IT. WHERE ARE WE GOING TO TAKE IT, THE LAKE? - SURE. - UGH, NO. THE LAKE STINKS TO HIGH HEAVEN WITH SWARMS OF BRINE FLIES. HOW DO WE MOVE IT? GEE, I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET A TRAILER HITCH FOR THE CAR. AND THEN YOU DRIVE IT? HONEY, THIS ON THE INTERSTATE? WELL, IT IS BIG. SO WHAT DO YOU SAY? LET'S CELEBRATE. OKAY. WHAT EXACTLY ARE WE CELEBRATING? GOOD ENOUGH. -ICE CREAM ALL AROUND. -YAY, ICE CREAM. -CHOCOLATE, YAY! -DID YOU HEAR THAT? ICE CREAM! - YEAH! - YEAH! WE'RE DELIGHTED TO HAVE HER. WE HAVE A SON AT THE Y AND A DAUGHTER AT THE U. AND OUR OLDEST SON IS AWAY ON A MISSION, SO... GROUND RULES-- NO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OPEN ABUSE INVESTIGATION AGAINST JUNIPER CREEK. AND RHONDA HAS PREPARED A STATEMENT URGING ALL OTHER GIRLS MARRIED OFF INTO A... HISTORICAL TRAGEDY LIKE POLYGAMY TO FIND HOPE IN HER EXAMPLE. RHONDA IS A VERY BRAVE GIRL. SHOULD I BRING OUT MORE SNACK MIX? MOM? SO, START BY TELLING ME THE STORY OF HOW YOU ESCAPED. -WERE YOU FRIGHTENED? -OH YES. VERY. ARE YOU AFRAID THEY'LL FIND YOU? NOW THAT I'M HERE, I FEEL SAFE. I THINK THIS'LL COME OUT THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW. OH, AND TUTTLE IS T-U-T-T... PLEASE COORDINATE THROUGH ME. I'M HANDLING ALL OF RHONDA'S PRESS. I KNEW IT WAS A BAD IDEA TO BRING HER HERE. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, SARAH. I DON'T TRUST HER FOR A SECOND. SHE'S HORRIBLE. HI. ARE WE STILL DOING YOUR HAIR? WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT? THEY'RE DOING A STORY ABOUT MY PLIGHT. -WHO'S THEY? -I N'T KNOW. DID YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ME OR MY FAMILY? THE STORY IS ABOUT ME, SARAH. DID MY PARENTS ARRANGE THIS? -I DON'T KNOW. -SHE CANNOT STAY HERE. YES, I AM STAYING. AUNT LAURA AND UNCLE CHUCK ARE GETTING CUSTODY. WHAT? RUN TWO SETS OF NUMBERS FOLDING  WEBER GAMING MEDICAL PLAN INTO HOME PLUS, OR A SEPARATE PPO. SAME WITH RETIREMENT. DO WE WANT TO FOLD IT IN OR RUN IT UNDER JADEN CORP OR WHAT? I SAT DOWN WITH THE MANAGER LARRY. HE'S A NICE GUY. HE SAID THERE'S 18 FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES AND ANOTHER SIX SEASONAL PART-TIME. VIDEO POKER IS SEASONAL? I ORDERED THIS FOR YOU. ABRAHAM LINCOLN? HE TRIED TO HOLD THINGS TOGETHER  IN A TIME OF GREAT CHANGE. HE NEVER FORGOT THAT HE WAS AN IMPERFECT HUMAN BEING. AND HE KNEW HE COULDN'T DO IT ALONE. WEBER GAMING'S A BIG MOVE FOR US. YOU CAN'T ASK ME TO EMBRACE IT WITHOUT CAUTION. I UNDERSTAND. I APPRECIATE THIS, BILL. YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT HIM? HE'S SUCH A REAL PERSON, YOU KNOW? LIKE A REGULAR GUY. I LIKE THAT. SO, YES, I THINK I'M DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT WITH HIM... - MMM-HM. - ...EXCEPT NO BINGO. BUT WHEN HE SAYS MY NAME HIS EYES GO, "SHHH." HE CAN'T CONTROL THAT. SO THAT'S GOOD. MAYBE HE'S JUST BEING  OLD-FASHIONED, TAKING IT SLOW. OH, IT'S FUN JUST FOOLING AROUND WITH HIM. YEAH, YOU SHOULDN'T FOOL AROUND WITH HIM TOO MUCH. THAT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT. -YOU MIGHT HURT HIM. -OH NO, MARGENE. OF COURSE. OF COURSE  I DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM. SO WHAT ARE YOUR INTENTIONS THEN? I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM HIM IN THE LONG RUN? I GUESS I DON'T KNOW YET. SORRY. YOU KNOW WHAT? I WAS THINKING OF DOING SOMETHING  SELFISH AND DECADENT TOMORROW. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME WITH ME? YOU AND ME? MMM-HM. YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND IN UTAH. REALLY? I LIKE YOU TOO, ANA. I DO. I PROBABLY CAN'T. ??? ANOTHER TIME MAYBE? YOU KNOW WHAT? TOMORROW COULD WORK. -REALLY? -YUP. -GREAT. -GREAT. MY THIRD WIFE JOYCE WAS TOUGH. WHEN I FINALLY TOLD HER THE  SCORE, I WAS TAKING MY RING OFF SHE CALLED ME A LECH AND AN A-HOLE. TOOK WEEKS TO REESTABLISH TRUST. I MEAN TO REALLY TRUST HER AGAIN. TAKING OFF THE RING IS PROBLEMATIC. IT SUGGESTS WE'RE CHEATING OR IT'S ALL ABOUT SEX. MMM-HM. WELL, WHAT'S DONE IS DONE. IT JUST HAPPENED. DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP. THERE'S NO ROAD MAP. I KNOW, I KNOW. IT'S JUST... I WAS A HAPPY GUY. I STILL AM. BARB, NICKI, MARGENE, THE KIDS. I HAD EVERYTHING I NEED TO WALK A RIGHTEOUS PATH AND THEN I MEET ANA. FINALLY GET A HANDLE ON THREE AND BAM! HOLY SPIRIT SUCKER PUNCH. WELL, THEY SAY FOUR IS A GOOD NUMBER. -THE ODD NUMBERS ARE TOUGH. -YEAH, WITH THREE... YOU GET A LOT OF THAT TWO AGAINST ONE. -OH YEAH. -IS EVERYONE ELSE ONBOARD? I HAVEN'T EVEN DISCUSSED IT YET. I MEAN, NICKI, SHE GREW UP WITH THE PRINCIPLE. AND I THINK BARB WOULD LOVE HER. BUT MARGENE... NEW WIFE IS ALWAYS HARDEST ON THE LAST WIFE. -UH-HUH. -YOU KNOW, I JUST... I'M WORRIED SHE'S GOING TO TAKE IT PERSONALLY, YOU KNOW? LIKE SHE'S LACKING. REMIND HER THAT EARTHLY INCREASE IS THE DUE OF EVERY RIGHTEOUS MAN, AS IS ETERNAL INCREASE ON RESURRECTION. JUST MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE YSICAL BOUNDARIES. -YOU FEEL THAT? -YEAH. SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO TOMORROW NIGHT? UM, I DON'T KNOW. -YOU FEEL THAT? -MMM. WE SHOULD GET DOWNSTAIRS. I COULD DO THIS FOREVER. I LOVE YOU. COMING. -HELLO, DARLING. -HELLO. OH, JESUS, IT'S SO HOT. COME IN. OH, THANK YOU. YOU GREW UP HERE IN UTAH, HERE IN THE CITY? NO, A FEW HOURS SOUTH. ST. GEORGE? CLOSE. HEY, WHAT'S THIS? THOSE ARE ME WITH MY PATIENTS. I WAS DENTAL HYGIENIST BACK IN BELGRADE, OF WHICH I WAS PROUD. OH, APARTMENT HAS NO AIR CONDITIONING. I COULD RUN OUT AND GET US A  FAN AND BE BACK IN 15 MINUTES. NO, DINNER IS READY. I BOILED MEAT ALL DAY LONG. WHAT A DISASTER. DO YOU LIKE DENTAL HYGIENE? YES. SIT. I THOUGHT I COULD PRACTICE HERE, BUT IT'S NOT SO EASY. I HAVE TO PASS FOUR EXAMS, AND WITH MY ENGLISH, WELL... BUT THEY SAY I CAN KEEP TESTING UNTIL I PASS. YOU WILL. THANK YOU. AND NOW, LET'S EAT. HEAVENLY FATHER, THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL WARM DAY AND THIS DELICIOUS FOOD. BLESS IT TO OUR USE AND BLESS ANA. IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, AMEN. LOOKS GREAT. SO THIS IS KNEDLE. THEY GO VERY WELL WITH THE BOILED MEAT. AND THIS IS PITA WITH  CHEESE PASTRY-- YOU'LL LIKE! -OH. -JUST WITH YOUR FINGERS. THAT WAS RUDE BEFORE, WHEN I CRUNCHED. -I'M SORRY. -OH NO NO. IT'S FINE. I'M JUST NOT USED TO PEOPLE PRAYING BEFORE THEY EAT. WEREN'T YORAISED WITH ANY RELIGION? WELL, MY FATHER WAS SERBIAN ORTHODOX, AND MY MOTHER WAS ATHEIST AND MY BEST FRIEND WAS MUSLIM. SO WHAT DOESHAT MAKE ME? HOPEFULLY A GOOD COOK. ARE YOU A MORMON? I KIND OF DO MY OWN THING. MARGIE, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT UP. I WAS AWAKE. DINNER WENT LONGER THAN I  EXPECTED. I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU. MMM. HOW'D IT GO? VENDORS-- YOU KNOW, A LOT OF SHOP TALK. WELL, I HOPE THEY APPRECIATED HOW HANDSOME YOU LOOK. I DON'T WANT THE WIVES TO KNOW THE FIRE  MARSHAL'S INVESTIGATING IT FOR ARSON. BOATS TEND NOT TO SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST. IT COULD HAVE BEEN ROMAN. YEAH, OR IT COULD HAVE BEEN A TICKED-OFF EMPLOYEE OR A CUSTOMER GONE POSTAL OR RANDOM GANG ACTIVITY. OR LET'S NOT FORGET AN OLD FUSE BOX. -YEAH. OR ROMAN. -HE'S A BUSINESSMAN. YOU WIN AND YOU LOSE  EVERY DAY. YOU KEEP YOUR COOL. BESIDES... ARSON'S NOT HIS STYLE. MAYBE HE'S IMPROVISING. FOUND  OUT WE GRABBED WEBER GAMING. -DAD? -HEY, BEN, LISTEN, I'M SORRY, BUT I CAN'T TAKE YOU TO THE D.M.V. TODAY. CAN YOU WAIT TILL TOMORROW? DON'T STRESS. I'LL GET MOM TO TAKE ME. ARE YOU SURE? THANKS FOR UNDERSTANDING. TAKE YOUR TIME WITH THE PARALLEL PARKING JUST LIKE WE PRACTICED. SURE. NICKI, BILL CAN'T TAKE BEN TO HIS DRIVER'S TEST. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE  ALL WENT AND SHOWED HIM OUR SUPPORT. THAT'S FINE WITH ME, BARB. BUT I THINK MARGIE JUST LEFT. OH HONEY, WHERE DID MARGENE JUST GO? ERRANDS. -HELLO? -Is this Nicolette Grant? YES. My name is Gary Wiltwith "The Sun-Times." We're doing a story on Rhonda Volmer. RHONDA? UH, WHAT KIND OF STORY? It's about her escape from Juniper Creek. Now I have a source who states  you're the daughter of Roman Grant. -Is that true? -I HAVE NO COMMENT. I understand that you helped procure Rhonda for your father. -WHAT? -ASK WHERE SHE IS. I have it that you're part of a network that shuttles young girls between compounds  across the border to Canada, a pipeline that supplies girls to compound elders-- I HAVE DONE NO SUCH THING. THAT GIRL FINAGLED HER WAY INTO MY FATHER'S GOOD GRACES. HER PARENTS ARE ROADSIDE TRASH. WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK WHERE SHE IS? BECAUSE I DON'T CARE, BARB. SHE'S RUINING MY LIFE. LOOK, SHE CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF. -HELLO. -HI. I BROUGHT YOU... OH, YOU'RE SO THOUGHTFUL. THANK YOU. COME IN. YOU ALREADY HAVE FLOWERS. THOSE ARE FROM MY BILL FROM LAST NIGHT. -OH. -YOURS ARE LOVELY. OH, I LOVE THAT DRESS. OH, THANKS. THANK YOU. SUCH A SLOB. DIDN'T MAKE MY BED. OH-- I DON'T MIND. -TA-DAH! -CHECK IT OUT. NICE FACE. YOU LOOK LIKE A SERIAL KILLER. CONGRATULATIONS, HONEY. YOU'RE ONE STEP CLOSER TO BECOMING A MAN. THANKS. HEY, DO YOU THINK I COULD TAKE THE CAR OUT FOR... A DRIVE? SURE. BE RESPONSIBLE THOUGH, OKAY? -I WILL. -MOM'S RIGHT, BE RESPONSIBLE. I'M NOT READY TO BE AN AUNT. -WE WERE TOGETHER THREE YEARS. -MM-HMM. YOU KNOW RIGHT AWAY WHEN A RELATIONSHIP IS NOT RIGHT AND WHEN IT IS, DON'T YOU THINK? MMM! -OH NO! -HMM? -WE MISSED OUR MASSAGES. -WHO CARES? YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS THOUGHT LOVE WAS LIKE ALL DREAMY... OOH LA LA. THEN I REALIZED IT'S JUST ABOUT WHO MAKES YOU FEEL POSITIVE ABOUT YOURSELF. HMM. YEAH. YOU WANT TO BE MARRIED THOUGH, RIGHT? OF COURSE. WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE LOVED AND TAKEN CARE OF? HE JUST WASN'T THE ONE. NOW HE'S MARRIED, HOUSE IN DUBROVNIK-- BORING. MMM. DO YOU THINK BILL IS MARRIED? NO. HOW CAN YOU BE SO SURE? I GUESS I CAN'T BE, BUT YOU CAN USUALLY TELL. YOU'VE DATED A MARRIED MAN BEFORE? MM-HMM. -YOU REMIND ME OF WHAT I MISS THE MOST. HMM? MY GIRLFRIENDS. I'M A POLYGAMIST. WHAT I HAVE A HUSBAND AND TWO WIVES. NO. YES. BUT YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE THE  WOMEN I SEE ON THE TELEVISION. WE'RE NOT LIKE THAT. WE DON'T LIVE ON A COMPOUND. WE ALL LIVE TOGETHER IN THE SUBURBS. SO WHAT'S IT LIKE? IT'S GOOD. SOMETIMES IT'S HARD. WHY THE HUG? -YOU SHARED WITH ME. -OH. WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND LIKE? THOUGHTFUL. HE'S STRONG AND CUTE. SPECIAL. HMMM. AND YOUR WIVES? SISTER-WIVES. THEY'RE AMAZING. YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY EVERYONE HAS A SOULMATE? WELL, SO FAR... I'VE FOUND THREE. ARE YOU OKAY? I COULDN'T GET IN TOUCH WITH REESE ALL MORNING, SO I FINALLY JUST WENT DOWN TO WEBER GAMING. LARRY THE MANAGER TOLD ME SOME  NUT JOB SHOWED UP A FEW DAYS AGO AND THREATENED REESE ABOUT SOMETHING. -DID HE SAY WHAT? -NO. BUT THIS IS CRAZY. BILL, HE SAID THEY BRANDED HIM. -IN THE INDUSTRY? -NOIN THE KEISTER, LIKE A COW-- SSSST! REESE IS GONE, BILL. WHOEVER  ITAS DROVE HIM INTO HIDING. SHOW ME HOW YOU HONK THE HORN. NO? -NO HONKING? -WHERE DID YOU DISAPPEAR TO EARLIER? ERRANDS. WE ALL WENT WITH BEN TO GET HIS DRIVER'S LICENSE. IT WAS A BIG EVENT FOR HIM. WHAT ERRANDS WERE SO IMPORTANT? I'LL MAKE IT UP TO HIM. MMM. MMMM. NOW I KNOW HOW HAPPY YOU REALLY AND TRULY WERE WHEN I JOINED THE FAMILY. NICKI, THE DISHWASHER'S MAKING THAT NOISE AGAIN. -CAN YOU DO THAT THING? -BARB, I'VE BEEN THINKING. IT HAS BEEN FOREVER SINCE JUST THE  THREE OF US DID SOMETHING TOGETHER. SO WHAT ABOUT LUNCH TOMORROW? THERE'S THIS RESTAURANT I REALLY WANT TO TAKE YOU TO. OH, HONEY, THAT'S SWEET, BUT I HAVE A TON OF READING. PLEASE? OH, IT WOULD  MEAN SO MUCH TO ME. -MY TREAT. -WELL... WELL, OKAY. SURE. NICKI? SURE. COME ON, LESTER. LET'S GO  PICK OUT MY DRESS FOR TOMORROW. YES YES. THERE'S SOMETHING UP WITH HER. SHE'S JUST BEING MARGENE. THE DISHWASHER. IT'S BEEN SO LONG, BEN. HOW ARE YOUR PARENTS? GOOD. EVERYONE'S GOOD. MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN, EVEN  IF YOU'RE NO LONGER IN MY WARD. -I GOT MY LICENSE TODAY. -CONGRATULATIONS. BEN, IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT? I'VE BEEN HAVING SEX. MORE THAN ONCE. OR... LIKE, A LOT. AND I DON'T THINK I CAN STOP. AND IS THE SEX YOU'RE HAVING GENDER-SPECIFIC? OH... NO NO, SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND. IS SHE A MEMBER OF THE CHURCH? NO. I KNOW.. BUT... BISHOP DEVERY, I REALLY DO LOVE HER. AND IT'S SO HARD NOT TO  BE CLOSE TO HER 'CAUSE IT'S  WHAT SHE WANTS TO BE DOING EVEN IF IT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO BE DOING. SEXUAL DESIRE ISN'T LOVE, BEN. I REALLY COULD SEE BEING WITH HER FOREVER. DO YOU THINK SHE MIGHT JOIN OUR CHURCH? I DON'T KNOW. SHE NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND OUR  HEAVENLY FATHER'S PLAN FOR ETERNITY. WE'RE FORTUNATE BECAUSE HE'S GIVEN  US A PATH TO ETERNAL MARRIAGE, ETERNAL FAMILY. BUT SEXUAL MORALITY IS AT  THE HEART OF THAT PLAN. YOU'RE A PRIESTHOOD HOLDER NOW. NOT YET. A TEMPLE MARRIAGE IS THE ONLY  MORAL WAY TO START A FAMILY. AND... I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE READY FOR THAT YET. HAVE YOU DISCUSSED THIS WITH THE BISHOP IN YOUR WARD? I'VE... ALWAYS FELT MORE COMFORTABLE TALKING WITH YOU. I WOULD HAVE COME HERE SOONER, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE A WAY OF GETTING HERE UNTIL TODAY. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU SOME LITERATURE. AND WE SHOULD MAKE A  PLAN OF ACTION FOR YOU. UH, AND YOU NEED TO INVITE  HER TO CHURCH WITH YOU. IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IF I  HAD A TALK WITH YOU BOTH. COME IN. -HI. -MMM. UM... CAN I HAVE BILL FOR A MINUTE? HE'S ACTUALLY NOT HERE. -WHERE IS HE? -I'M REALLY NOT SURE. HONESTLY, I MEAN, HOW DO YOU LOSE BILL ON YOUR NIGHT? I JUST DON'T KEEP HIM ON A LEASH. WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? HAVE HIM CALL ME WHEN HE GETS IN. DON'T WAIT UP. -THIS IS A SURPRISE. -I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND I THOUGHT-- WELL, I THOUGHT I MIGHT JUST-- COME IN. -SO WHAT'S THE OCCASION? -I BROUGHT YOU THIS. WATER FILTER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BRING ME THINGS, YOU KNOW, TO COME-- -WAIT WAIT WAIT. -AM I HURTING YOU? -NO NO, IT'S NOT THAT. -THEN WHAT? ANA, I CAN'T. BILL, I'M NOT ANTI-RELIGIOUS. YOU'RE NOT WHAT? WELL, THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN YOU WERE PRAYING, I STOPPED ALL MY TALKING NOT BECAUSE I HAVE SOMETHING AGAINST RELIGION OR MORMONS, BUT BECAUSE I JUST DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT ALL, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SEEM STUPID. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU I WOULD  NEVER JUDGE YOU FOR YOUR BELIEFS. THANK YOU. BUT THAT'S NOT IT EITHER. I WANT TO BE WITH YOU TOO, I DO. BUT I'M AFRAID IF WE DO THIS, THEN... THEN WE MIGHT JEOPARDIZE WHAT COULD BE BETWEEN US. THAT'S A VERY SWEET LINE. NO, IT'S NOT A LINE. I THINK THAT IT WASN'T AN ACCIDENT THAT WE MET. AND IF IT'S NOT, WHAT WE COULD HAVE WILL BE SO WORTH THE WAIT, I PROMISE. BUT I NEED TO KNOW FOR SURE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ALL THOSE THINGS TO HAVE ME. I SHOULD-- I SHOULD GO. SOMEONE ELSE BROUGHT YOU FLOWERS? IT'S MY GIRLFRIEND MARGENE. MARGIE! MARGIE! HAVE YOU BEEN GETTING PIE AT THE DINER? BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING, I KNOW I OVERSTEPPED. BUT, BILL-- BILL-- I THINK ANA WOULD MAKE AN AMAZING FOURTH. AT FIRST I JUST THOUGHT SHE WAS SOME RUSSIAN TRAMP, BUT EVERY TIME I SEE HER, SHE IS SO FUNNY AND SMART. YOU'RE MY WIFE, MARGENE, YOU CAN'T  BE SEEING THE GIRL I'M DATING. WHY DO ONLY YOU GET TO CHOOSE? I'D BE MARRYING HER TOO. AND I LOVE HER.  SHE LOVES YOU, SHE LOVES ME, SHE'LL LOVE BARB. SHE'LL GROW TO LOVE NICKI. HONEY, THERE'S A PROTOCOL TO THIS. I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF SHE'S OKAY WITH THE PRINCIPLE. SHE IS. I TOLD HER. -YOU TOLD HER? -MM-HMM. I TOLD HER. TOLD HER I HAVE TWO SISTER-WIVES AND SHE'S OKAY WITH IT. MARGIE, MARGIE, YOU'VE GOT TO SLOW DOWN. I NEED TO KNOW THAT THIS IS THE HOLY SPIRIT TALKING. WHAT IF THE HOLY SPIRIT'S TALKING TO ME? -IS IT? -HOW DO YOU KNOW? YOU JUST KNOW, MARGENE. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS THE HOLY SPIRIT WHEN WE MET. I JUST KNEW THAT I LOVED YOU AND BARB AND NICKI AND THE KIDS ND IT  IDN'T MATTER OW IT HAPPENED. SO HOW DO YOU KNOW WE CAN'T  HAVE THAT WITH ANA TOO? WE MIGHT. I HOPE WE CAN. BUT WE CAN'T TRICK HER INTO  THE FAMILY. YOU HAVE TO STOP. AT LEAST TILL SHE KNOWS... EVERYTHING. -OKAY? -FINE. IT'S FINE. BUT DON'T JUST PLAY AROUND WITH HER, BILL. ANA'S VERY PRECIOUS. APRIL BLESSING. I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT. THAT WOMAN IS A HORROR. -WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT US? -YOU READ IT D YOU TELL ME. ??? THEY WOULD BE THE PARENTS OF SARAH'S LITTLE CHUM. HEATHER. I'M GONNA GO OVER THERE AND  I'M GORIP RHONDA'S HEAD OFF. ??? ??? THERE'S TOO MANY OTHER HEADS TO RIP OFF FIRST. I'LL TALK TO SARAH. I THINK THAT WOULD BE A PRUDENT MOVE. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE  MUCH OF ANYTHING ABOUT US. -NOT THIS TIME. -NICKI! I'LL TALK TO SARAH. DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS? UH, NO ONE READS THAT PAPER, MOM. IT'S "THE SUN-TIMES" AND I'M TALKING  ABOUT RHONDA AND THE TUTTLES. SHE TURNED UP AT WORK. HEATHER OFFERED. WHEN? A WEEK AGO. AND YOU KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT HER? -WHY WOULDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT? -WHY WOULD I TELL YOU? BECAUSE I'M YOUR MOTHER AND WOULD LIKE TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE BURDENS AND RESPONSIBILITIES  THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ASSUME. MOM, HER BEING HERE WOULD BE A BURDEN. I UNDERSTAND. SHE'S DIFFICULT, BUT SHE NEEDS OUR HELP. SINCE WHEN DO WE PUT OURSELVES AHEAD OF THOSE IN NEED? I DIDN'T. I HELPED HER. I DID WHAT I THOUGHT WOULD MAKE OUR LIVES MOST NORMAL. OKAY? MS. GRANT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I THINK IT'S DISGRACEFUL WHAT YOU'RE DOING. RHONDA'S STORY NEEDS TO BE TOLD. YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT FIRSTHAND. DON'T MAKE IT SEEM LIKE WE'RE  THE SAME BECAUSE WE'RE NOT. JUNIPER CREEK IS NOTHING LIKE THE INCESTUOUS PIT THAT YOU COME FROM. POLYGAMY BY DEFINITION IS TOXIC, CRUEL AND CULTISH. I'M SORRY YOU'RE STILL  STRUGGLING WITH YOUR PAST. I'M NOT STRUGGLING WITH MY PAST. YOU'VE YET TO MAKE PEACE WITH YOURS. I'VE GOT YOUR NUMBER. I SPOKE TO LOUISE ARCHER-- YOUR EX-SISTER-WIFE. YOU ARE A SELF-ABSORBED WOMAN WHO COULD NOT SACRIFICE HER OWN  NEEDS TO SUSTAIN A MARRIAGE AND THEN BLAMES EVERYONE ELSE IN  THE BOOK FOR HER OWN UNHAPPINESS. YOU'RE STILL PRACTICING  THE PRINCIPLE, AREN'T YOU? THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. IT TOOK ME YEARS TO UNTANGLE  MYSELF, MS. GRANT-- YEARS. AND YOU'LL NEVER GET YOUR  HANDS ON RHONDA AGAIN. HI, RHONDA. YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME. WE'VE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU. YOU CAN'T STAY HERE. YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME. YOU LIED TO ME. YOU AND BARB, YOU SAID I COULD STAY WITH YOU. NO, THAT WAS APRIL BLESSING. SHE KEPT YOU FROM US. SHE'S AN ANGRY OPPORTUNIST. DO YOU KNOW WHAT  THAT MEANS? SHE'S USING YOU. SHE HELPS ME. MY STORY NEEDS TO BE TOLD. WE WANT TO TELL YOUR STORY TOO, BUT TELEVISION-- BILL OWNS A TV STATION. IT'S TRUE. I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. LOOK, WE CAN GET YOU ON TV. WHY HAVEN'T I HEARD ABOUT THIS BEFORE? YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING. SHE'S TRYING TO TAKE ME! SHE'S TRYING TO TAKE ME! AUNT LAURA, SHE'S TRYING TO TAKE ME, HELP! RHONDA, WHAT'S THE MATTER? HONEY, HONEY... WHAT DID SHE WANT? COME ON, LET'S GO INSIDE. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. I TOLD HER NOON, RIGHT? I MUST HAVE. YOU'RE HERE. THERE SHE IS. SOMEONE LOST A MATTRESS ON THE 215. YOU WERE DOWNTOWN? NICKI? HEY, YOU WENT TO GO SEE THAT WOMAN, DIDN'T YOU? SHE'S A HYPOCRITE, AND A GLORY-SEEKER. SOMEONE HAS TO STOP HER. WHY DO YOU LET HER GET TO YOU? YOU ARE BETTER THAN HER AND YOU SHOULD RISE ABOVE IT IT'S LIKE TALKING TO A FORTUNE COOKIE. EXCUSE ME?! IT'S JUST SO EASY FOR YOU, BARB. -HELLO, MARGENE. -HI, ANA. I WANT YOU TO MEET MY FRIENDS. THIS IS BARB AND NICKI. -BARB, NICKI, THIS IS ANA. -HELLO. DO YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN FOR A SECOND? WE'RE NOT QUITE READY TO ORDER YET. ANA'S FROM SERBIA. THAT'S THE FORMER REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA. -REALLY? -MM-HMM. OH YES, THE BOMBINGS, THE REFUGEES. MY VILLAGE WAS BURNED. JOKE. I'LL HAVE THE TUNA SALAD SANDWICH. HOLD THE CELERY. MARGENE BORE HER TESTIMONYTO ANA? I DON'T KNOW IF I'D CALL IT BEARING TESTIMONY. MARGENE'S MORE OF A GOSSIP. DO YOU THINK ANA'S NOT  INTERESTED IN A BIGGER COMMITMENT? SHE SAID SHE'D BE. DID SHE SAY IT FOR REAL OR IS SHE JUST TRYING TO GET DOWN YOUR DOCKERS? I THINK SHE MEANT IT. THEN I THINK YOU SHOULD BUCK UP, STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND BRING HER INTO THE FOLD. TELL HER WHO YOU ARE. TELL  HER WHAT YOU DESIRE FOR HER. IF THIS IS THE HOLY SPIRIT TALKING, THEN BE STRONG IN THAT CONVICTION. YUCK. THIS HAS CELERY. NO! DON'T SEND IT BACK. MARGIE, THIS HAS CELERY. I DON'T LIKE CELERY. MM-HMM. FINE. I'LL EAT IT. -WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? -YOU'LL HURT HER FEELINGS. MARGENE, I DON'T LIKE CELERY IN MY TUNA SALAD. I'M NOT GONNA EAT THIS FOR  THE BENEFIT OF SOME WAITRESS. - NICKI! - YES? I ASKED FOR THIS WITHOUT CELERY. OH, THAT KITCHEN. ONE SECOND. YOU ARE SO RUDE. AND IT'S SO EMBARRASSING. I CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE YOU SOMETIMES. IT'S KIND OF A WAITRESS'S JOB, MARGIE. IF YOU FEEL SO GUILTY, THEN LEAVE HER 15%. -HERE. -OH, THANK YOU. -I DIDN'T EVEN HEAR YOU. -I SNUCK IN. I LEFT THE ARTICLE ON THE DESK. -AND IT'S OKAY? -IT'S FINE. AT LEAST IT WOULD BE, IF NICKI WOULD LEAVE IT ALONE. -I'LL TALK TO HER. -I ALREADY DID. AND HOW ARE WE DOING OTHERWISE? COULD USE ANOTHER PAIR OF HANDS AND A LONGER DAY, BUT OTHER THAN THAT... I THINK MARGENE HAS A NEW FRIEND. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN? -A WAITRESS. HOW DO YOU KNOW?  BECAUSE SHE TOOK US TO LUNCH AT A DINER. I THINK IT WAS A SETUP. LOOK, SHE FORMS THESE INAPPROPRIATE  ATTACHMENTS TO OTHER WOMEN, BILL. REMEMBER THE CHECKOUT GIRL FROM ALBERTSON'S? WHAT IS IT WITH HER AND WOMEN IN THE SERVICE INDUSTRY? WE NEED TO PUT A STOP TO THIS BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF HAND. YOU KNOW HOW SHE GETS WHEN SHE WANTS SOMETHING. SHE CLAMPS DOWN LIKE A RABID DOG AND WON'T LET GO. YOU SOUND A LITTLE JEALOUS. MARGENE AND I ARE BOUND BY A HOLY COVENANT BUT IT'S DANGEROUS WHEN  AISTER-WIFE STRAYS, BILL. AND ESPECIALLY ONE LIKE MARGENE. -SHE SHARES HERSELF TOO EASILY. -SHE CAN HAVE FRIENDS, NICKI. -SHE'S GOT US. -THAT'S RIGHT AND YOU HAVE HER. SO MAYBE YOU COULD TRY TO DO MORE THINGS TOGETHER. -WHAT KIND OF THINGS? -FUN THINGS. OH, PLEASE! I'LL CATCH YOU. -DAD, HI. -HI, HONEY. COULD YOU STEP INSIDE? I NEED TO SPEAK WITH SARAH A MOMENT. ONE OF YOUR MOTHERS... TRIED TO ABDUCT RHONDA THIS AFTERNOON. LOOK, SARAH, I'M AN OFFICER OF THE LAW. I KNOW PEOPLE PRACTICE POLYGAMY. PERSONALLY, I FEEL THE  STATE'S MUCH TOO TOLERANT. BUT THAT'S THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION. HOWEVER, I CAN'T STOMACH CHILDREN BEING ABUSED. I UNDERSTAND. RHONDA SAYS SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE  BEING ALONE WITH YOUR FATHER. WHAT? SHE TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR HOME. HOMES. HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING OR BEEN MADE TO DO ANYTHING THAT YOU FELT WAS INAPPROPRIATE? THAT'S NOT TRUE. UM, MY-- MY FAMILY'S NOTHING-- I UNDERSTAND HOW EASILY THINGS GET TWISTED AROUND, HOW YOU CAN BE MADE TO FEEL THAT CERTAIN THINGS ARE NORMAL OR THAT YOU'RE SEHOW TO BLAME. YOU CAN GET SHAMED INTO SILENCE. - HEY. - HEY, I WAS HOPING YOU'D STOP BY. I, UM... I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING. BUT IF YOU'RE BUSY, I-- SIT DOWN. SO WHAT'S UP? I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT THIS AND... THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO TELL YOU. ANA, THIS IS COMPLETELY  UNEXPECTED-- YOU, ME, I WASN'T-- -LOOKING FOR IT. -ME EITHER. IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME TO REALLY OPEN MYSELF UP. -YOU KNOW, REALLY SHARE. -OKAY. BUT I CAN'T BE WITH YOU. I CAN'T SEE YOU ANYMORE. WHY? HAT THIS IS. DO YOU HAVE TO KNOW RIGHT NOW? YES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS EITHER,  BUT I MEANT WHAT I SAID YESTERDAY. I WANT TO FIND OUT. YOU CAN  CALL IT WHATEVER YOU NEED TO. -I DON'T CARE, JUST DON'T-- -PICK UP. -WE CAN TALK LATER. -NO, LET'S TALK NOW. WAIT FOR ME OUTSIDE. WE CAN BE PRIVATE THERE. PLEASE? PLEASE. M SO ATTRACTED TO YOU. SELMA GREENE? HOLLIS NEEDS A WORD. -HE'S HERE? -IN A SAFE PLACE. WHAT DOES HE WANT WITH ME? HOLLIS WILL EXPLAIN. WE NEED TO PAT YOU DOWN FIRST. -HELLO? -Hey, Margene. -It's Ana. -ARE YOU OKAY? No, Bill just dumped me. -WHY? -I don't know. Oh, Margene, I have to go. I'm at work. Can I call you later? YEAH. MOM? HONEY? BABY, WHAT IS IT? TELL ME. OH. HOLLIS. -WHEN DID YOU GET BACK? -I'M NOT BACK. IT KILLS DIRECTIONAL MICROPHONES. THEY CAN HEAR THROUGH WINDOWS. WE OFFERED CARTER REESE A FAIR PRICE FOR WEBER GAMING. GOD WANTS US TO POSSESS IT FOR OUR PORTFOLIO. YOU TOOK IT. THAT COMPANY AND THAT BOAT ARE OURS. WEBER GAMING WAS PURCHASED LEGALLY. YOU WILL DISGORGE THAT COMPANY. GET HIS PANTS DOWN. WAIT A SECOND. COME ON! WAIT A MINUTE. COME ON, JUST HOLD ON! COMEN, CUT IT OUT! CUT IT OUT! WEBER GAMING WAS PURCHASED FOR ROMAN GRANT. I'M ON THE U.E.B. THERE HASN'T BEEN A HENRICKSON ON THE U.E.B. FOR OVER 20 YEARS. -THERE IS NOW. -THEN TELL ROMAN GRANT THAT WEBER GAMING IS OURS. WE WILL PUT FORTH OUR HAND TO STEADY THE ARK OF GOD'S COVENANT. WE WILL VANQUISH THOSE FALSELY-ANNOINTED HEADS OF THE PRIESTHOOD. ANY ASSAULT ON ROMAN'S BOARD MEMBERS IS A DIRECT AFFRONT TO HIS AUTHORITY. BUT-- BUT LET ME... TALK TO HIM... SEE IF HE CAN'T BE REASONED INTO GIVING UP WEBER GAMING. SELMA, GIVE BILL HENRICKSON A RIDE BACK INTO TOWN. OFFICER TUTTLE, I'M BARBARA HENRICKSON, SARAH'S MOTHER. I KNOW WHO YOU ARE. WHATEVER YOUR MISGIVINGS MAY BE ABOUT MY FAMILY, YOU WILL KEEP THE CHILDREN OUT OF IT. MRS. HENRICKSON, I'M SO SORRY. HEATHER, GO BACK UPSTAIRS, PLEASE. -DAD, DON'T. -HONEY! IT IS MY DUTY TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE. THERE'S NO ABUSE IN MY HOME. I'VE BEEN A COUNSELOR IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I KNOW THE WARNING SIGNS, SIR. I'VE WORKED IN COOPERATION WITH C.P.S. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING: YOU DO NOT TAKE THE WILD, UNSUPPORTED ALLEGATIONS OF A DAMAGED PATHOLOGICAL LIAR TO QUESTION SOMEONE. SHAME ON YOU. IF YOU WISH TO QUESTION MY DAUGHTER,  YOU BETTER DAMN WELL HAVE A BASIS OR I WILL BRING YOU UP  FOR UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT  SO FAST YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN. I'D LIKE TO SPEAK WITH RHONDA. CHUCK. IT'S OKAY, AUNT LAURA. I WANT TO. WE ARE RIGHT HERE, RHONDA. SHE CAN'T DO ANYTHING, HONEY. I'M SO GLAD YOU FOUND ME. WHY DID YOU SAY SUCH RECKLESS THINGS ABOUT US? THEY KEEP PUTTING WORDS INTO MY MOUTH. RHONDA. YOU CANNOT KEEP LYING TO GET WHAT YOU WANT. I LOVE YOU, BARB. KISS OFF. PLEASE KEEP YOUR DAUGHTER AWAY FROM HEATHER. I DON'T WANT MY DAUGHTER'S MORAL JUDGMENT COMPROMISED. YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO FAKE PRAY. -WHAT? -FOR BILL. THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? BECAUSE YOU TOLD ME HE'S RELIGIOUS. IT'S EASY. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER AND CLOSE YOUR EYES. HE DOES THE TALKING, YOU NOD. THAT'S IT. I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT SIMPLE. BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE UP. YOU CAN'T. I CAN'T FORCE HIM TO SEE ME. BUT ANA, SOMETHING LIKE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN. WHEN YOU MEET SOMEONE WHO MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A BETTER PERSON? SOMEONE WHO MAKES YOU REALIZE YOU CAN BE MORE THAN WHO YOU ARE? IF YOU ASK ME,THAT'S LOVE. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. DON WE GOT A PROBLEM. I JUST HAD A TALK WITH HOLLIS GREENE. I THOUGHT THEY WERE ALL CRAZIES CHASEDUT AND HIDING IN MEXICO. WE THOUGHT WE WERE POACHING WEBER GAMING FROM ROMAN... WELL, HE WAS POACHING IT FROM THE GREENES. THEY WANTED IT. THEY STILL DO. -Hello? -CAN YOU STEP OUTSIDE, PLEASE? I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I LOVE HER, I DO. I CAN'T HELP IT. I CAN'T MARRY HER FOR YOU, MARGENE. SHE CAN LEARN HOW TO PRAY. I CAN TEACH HER. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING  TO MAKE THIS A CELESTIAL CALLING. WELL, WHAT IS IT THEN? WHAT IS IT THEN, IF IT'S NOT? JUST... IT MIGHT BE... LUST. THAT'S HOW YOU FELT ABOUT ME AT FIRST. AND LOOK WHAT WE HAVE. NO, MARGENE, IT WAS DIFFERENT. I LOVED YOU SO MUCH IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN  CELESTIAL. I'M SURE OF THAT NOW. LET'S GO HOME. Welcome to www.1000fr.com
