 We're all great. All the distribution contracts are signed. Arizona, Colorado, ldaho, Wyoming.

 Lunch rush is over, if you want to tell me your troubles. -Where are you from? -Serbia. -That's a long way from home. -I know, I'm a new citizen. Say, if there was a video poker machine in here, would you play it? Yes, I watch poker on TV. You do? And if I brought you a piece of pie, would you eat it? Yes. Well, that makes us both a good salesman. Hey, Mom. Where's Wanda? -I had her committed. -What? To Ann Willow Psychiatric. Someone had to do the right thing. It was very hard on me. I come before you to speak for the principle of democracy... ...the doctrine of fairness and a spirit of forgiveness. America is sick. Her heart is heavy. Should you get that? No. Maybe you should. Okay. -Hello. -Hey, bitchcakes. You might wanna come to work. -I ' m not on the schedule. - Yeah, I know. But your Grandma 's here and she's asking for you. Sarah. -Oh, it's so cute, hugging granny. -Shut up, shut up, go. I was being genuine, hater. See you later, Rhonda. -Where have you been? -I slept out on the street for week. You didn't call your mom, did you? -No, why? -She'll send me back to that shelter. If I wind up there, Adaleen will get me and have me forcibly impregnated. I don't think that's gonna happen. It will. Sarah, you have to help me. You have to help me find a place to stay. I don't wanna go back to the compound. Is that what you want? No, okay? I'll help you. But you cannot tell anybody else about our family... ...okay? Yes. Hello. Hello? Rhonda? And then the trees breathe it out as oxygen. This boy is something else. Brush your teeth, I'll tuck you in in two minutes. -Okay. Good night, Dad. -Good night, son. And don't wake your brother. He's smart as a whip. I'm happy about this. This summer program's gonna give him a leg-up in the fall. This family needs to look forward. Now that we have this ugly business with your father finally behind us. Right? Yeah. Right? -Right? -Yeah. Come on, fatty, get up. You're needed. Sweetie. Are you feeling okay? I'm fine. I just worked late last night. They shouldn't keep you there all hours. I need you to take Teenie to Honeybees. Where are the sister-wives? Don't be fresh. Mom, wait. Have you heard anything on Rhonda? A shelter downtown thought they saw someone... ...who fit her description last Wednesday. If they found her, what would you do? Rhonda was the one who exposed me, honey. She put Roman up to it. Why didn't you tell us? I didn't wanna turn you against her. It's not her fault. I don't know what we'd do if we found her but we have a responsibility. She needs our help. I think she'd still keep her here. I never trusted her. I know where she is. Where? I think you should tell mom. -I think you should tell mom. -Shut up, I think you should. After you tell mom about you having sex with Brynn. What are you gonna do? I'll figure it out on my own. Bill. We have a problem with Weber Gaming. Reese stood me up this morning. Took me two hours to finally track him down. I don't think he's interested in our offer anymore. Or us. Where is he? Holed up at the Red Line downtown. Maybe Roman bid higher. Well, how could he get her out of the UEB vote? Can we talk to Reese? Can you get him in? I'll try. Wayne. What do you have there? School gave it to me. Look, I don't want you to play with this. Do you understand? You either, Raymond. It's dangerous. I wasn't. Hey. What are you doing? I'm disposing of this. You shouldn't do that. I don't want it near on the boys. Why don't you give them to me? Why? You can't throw them in the garbage, Nicki. Mom is not mad at you, sweetie. Mom is mad at the necklace. Hi. Bill's not here. I know. I waited until I saw him go. Can I come in? He's really angry with you. Can I please come in? The hospital wouldn't say when they'll release her. -And I kind of caused a disruption. -Oh, no, Joey. I know. Will you talk to them about getting her out? It's a good hospital. I think.... I hope Wanda's getting the help she needs. Joey. I just want something simple. A job and me and Wanda and our baby. Joey... ...you and I have always been respectful of each other. But you've gotta move off the compound. Everything about that place drags you down. I don't know that I can make it anywhere else. I've tried, Barb, twice. Nobody wants to hire a felon. We would help you. I could talk to Bill. No, don't. -I don't wanna deal with him anymore. -Okay. No Bill. We'll make it work. But you have got to get out of that place. For you and Wanda. You're an amazing person. I should go. Okay, Judy. Always a pleasure. -Make sure John does his algebra. -Will do, sister. See you at mass. Mrs. Henrickson... -...you're here. -Yes. -Didn't you get my message? -I did. We didn't give it to him. Wayne's not a baptized catholic and we don't consider the rosary a toy. When my husband and l enrolled Wayne... ...I made it clear that he was not to be indoctrinated. He hasn't been. We're a very progressive school. We don't believe in proselytizing the children of different faith. Well, what do you believe? I'm sorry? I think I'd like to know what your religion is about exactly. Well... ...I suppose the fundamental theological distinctions for Catholics... ...are a belief in the holy Trinity and transubstantiation. What's the second thing you mentioned? Transubstantiation. When we receive communion. The Eucharist is in fact the body and blood of Christ. Why would you ever wanna believe that? Because we adore and receive a present Christ in the Eucharist. Body, blood, soul, divinity. Wayne's a lovely child and we're very happy to have him here. Mr. Reese, we agreed on 30 days. -Things have changed. -Was it another offer? Look, I'm sorry. But if you're gonna make this happen, it's gotta be this week. -That's impossible. -We're not close to vetting the company. -You gotta give us a chance. -No, I don't. What I've gotta do is make decisions that are in my self-interest. No. No, Roy. Meet me at 2:00. Not at home. I don't care about the goddamn lamps. We'll buy new ones. Look, you can't expect my bank to back me without a review. Not in three days. What if I put five percent earnest money in an escrow account? Thirty days to close, bending the numbers, and we're both covered. This isn't a business for dabblers. How about seven percent earnest money? In 72 hours. You're all nuts, you guys. Fine. I'll give you until Thursday. If you pull this off by Thursday, I'll throw in a boat. -I don't really need a boat. -Your wives will love it. Where we gonna get that kind of cash? We can't access our funds... -...until we incorporate a new entity. -I don't know yet. But believe me, we're gonna get it. This is my mom's eBay room. She sells Dippity Glass flowers. Look who found out? And here she is. Don't be mad, everyone's talking at work. Doesn't she look cute in shorts? What are you gonna do with me? -I hate it here. -Then leave. You lied to me. You're the one that screwed my mom over. Is that true? No, old Roman did it. Not me. -I tried to stop him. -You're a lying liar. I was being forced to marry an 80-year-old man. Stop. Smoking corrupts the body. Why would you do that when you know it bothers her? I won't go back to the compound. No, you can't. It's the American Taliban. -You can stay with me. -No. I want David to come over. I want him to come to the Dippity Glass room... ...and give me an orgasm. You know what an orgasm is, don't you? Stop it. I think she needs to know about these things. What's your house like? Is it carpeted? No. I mean... ...it's okay, we have carpets. I told mom she was gonna stay here for one night. And her dad is totally unstable. He spends all his time at a karaoke bar getting drunk on litchi and gin. Oh, my God, you totally believed me. You're such as racist. Shut up. Please. You and I were friends once. Before all these awful things started happening. Kathy. Hi, Joey. What are you doing? -Ron died on Tuesday. -Yeah, I heard. Gee, I'm real sorry. Thanks. Oh, good, you're home. I ran into Kathy... ...and, wouldn't you know it, she is a natural with that baby. Get out. Kathy, you know of course, that Joey used to play professional football. I know. -Excuse me. Excuse me. -What do you-- Let go of me. Stop it. You were not welcome in my house anymore. -Why not? -You put my wife in a mental institution. And rightly so. Stop this disgraceful behavior. You are embarrassing me. Now, get back in there... ...and show that poor young widow a little courtliness. I'm on to you, chico. What's that suppose to mean? Wanda is not the only one in the world for you. You and Wanda on your own can come to no good. It's sicko love. It's time for you to take a second wife. And get on with the sacred business of living the principle. I have other concerns right now. Well, if you won't do it for me then at least do it for Wanda. They're sweet numbers, Bill, I told you that. I just need to think about it. I just need the cash for 30 days and that's all. End of 30 days, everything's set up. -I can repay it. -I don't know. You don't know what? Well, to start with, I want more than six percent interest. I want a percentage of the business. -How much? -Fifteen. -Am I conscious? -Don't be a jerk. What, do you expect some kind of family discount? No, I expect you to be reasonable. You're asking me to come up with an awful lot of cash in two days. -This is reasonable. -Well, do you even have the money? Come on, Bill. I'm so much more liquid than you, it's not even funny. Okay, big shot, then get it. Look, I'm not sure that I wanna get involved in this... ...revenge fantasy of yours for six percent. The man humiliated my wife. You and I lived on the streets out of a van because of him. What part of a revenge fantasy doesn't appeal to you? Well, I've moved on. How? My grandfather, your father... ...went out in a car one night with Roman Grant. And only one of them came back. You think I don't think about that? Look... ...I'm interested. Very. Fifteen percent. Hey... ...give me my ball back. Go on say it. -ls he solid? -Yes. Very. What's he asking for? Still negotiating. Yeah, it's me. Craving, I need pie. It's bad. Hi. -I've come for pie. -Okay, what kind? Strawberry rhubarb, if you got it. We got it. How are you? Good. -You seem-- Happier today. -What? I wasn't sure you'd be working. I work dinner Monday, Tuesday and lunch Wednesday to Friday. Dinner, Monday, Tuesday. Lunch, Wednesday through Friday. Got it. Do you like the work? Oh, yes, it's very stimulating. Try again. Say, it's nice weather we're having. Yeah, it's very sunny. I'm back. I'm glad. Oh, I'm sorry. I need the whole pie... ...to go. Okay. Oh, and can I get the lemon meringue? And the blueberry, too. Give me both of those. I took my ring off. You're kidding. Ana. Woman in the diner. The waitress? I don't know what happened. I've never done that before. Never had to. Is this serious? I don't know. I have no idea if this is the right time. But there I was. You can't plan or schedule these things, Bill. They happen in their own time. Do you have a testimony for her? I don't even know her phone number. Well, one step at a time. Waitresses can be very appealing. Hi. This is Rhonda. -Hi. -Hi. You shouldn't address me unchaperoned. Rhonda, please. She escaped from Juniper Creek. Can we come in? Are you two running some kind of underground railroad or something? They're related. Heather, could you show Rhonda the apartment? I've never been here before. I got a good record collection in the other room. -Records? -Yeah. Original LPs. Could you just show her? What's going on? My dad grew up in Juniper Creek and his family is still there. His second wife is Roman Grant's daughter. You know who he is. And Rhonda is his fianc?e. She's 1 6. She fled the compound... ...and she someday wants to be in the top 40. And that guy that night was Alby, Roman's son. I think he's pretty unstable. -Can she stay here? -Here? With me? -How long? -Tonight. Until I can figure something else out. If she goes to the shelter they'll just send her back... ...and I can't take her home. Sarah, I cannot have a 1 6-year-old runaway staying in my apartment. I know. How do you get mixed up in all this? It's my life. All right. Maybe I can have my cousin come and stay... ...so I won't have to be alone with her. Okay? He has the mark of Cain. He doesn't have anything I've ever heard of and I have pretty eclectic taste. -So, you like music? -Yeah. My mom's in a tabernacle choir. Runs in the family. We thank you for this food to nourish our bodies. For our homes, for the grace of one another. And for Teenie's achievement... ...as a new Honeybees badge-holder in first aid. We ask that you continue to watch over our family. In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. I met with the vice principal of Wayne's school today. How's our boy doing? -You wont believe what's happening there. -What? There's all sort of indoctrination. We were definitely misled. -Really? -How are they indoctrinating? Wayne. What happens this Wednesday? The assumption of the Virgin Mary. -It's not funny, Marge. -What do they assume? It's when Mary's body and soul ascended into heaven. But it's the Blessed Mother. -It's not Satan worship. -It's nonsense. I think we should find him another school. -Are we rich? -You pushed for that school, Nicki. -It's got the best ranking in the city. -Let's discuss this later. Look, children can't resist that black magic... ...hocus pocus Catholic pageantry. And the nuns, they know it, believe me. I went to Catholic school, Nicki... ...with a lot of non-Catholics. -What? -lt took so much work... ...to get us into that school. I know... ...but I can't believe you're even making me defend this. Then don't. Nicki, I'd like some ice. Can you help me get it? Bill, what? Please don't tell me you won't support me on this. That nun is the definition of smug. Look, just hold on a minute. -It's a top school. -I don't like it. And those nuns are very abrasive. It's far enough away that I can be a father to him in public. And that's important to him. -It's important to me. -He's just a boy. He's susceptible to a way of thinking that isn't ours. Nicki, we live in a world that doesn't share our values. TV, movies. But he's going out into the world. He's gonna be comfortable with all kinds of people. His religious education is conferred to me. And I'm gonna see to it that he receives it and practices his faith. -You trust me, don't you? -Yes. I'm just surprised, I guess. -Are you all right? -Fine. Nicki... ...all I want is for some place where you and Bill can be public together. Especially after everything that's happen to you and your family. I know. Don? I'm sorry to call so late, Bill, but I have to say this. I'm uncomfortable with Weber Gaming. I don 't believe you're thinking rationally and you're being driven by emotion. -Don, I thought this through and-- -Bill, it's revenge. And I don't think I want any part of it. Not at the expense of my family. It's not just revenge. Yes, it is. It is revenge and I don't know what else to say. Don, just-- -Hi. -Are you alone? Yes. Is everything okay? Mom refuses to look after the baby. There's a woman named Kathy here right now. -Now? -And that's not all. Mom wants me to marry her. -You're kidding. -I wish I was. She might stay the night. I should find some place else to sleep. Don't get sucked in, Joey. Do you think Bill put mom up to this Kathy thing? No. No. Of course not. Don't tell Bill that I don't wanna take a second wife, okay? I won't. He thinks it's because I'm weak but it's not. I think any man who lives the principle is... ...selfish. Joey, you can't speak about my husband like that. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. It's okay. You're the only thing keeping me going. I'll let you go. I got him to sleep. Oh, great. There's Jerry. He's just so disrupted. I don't ever-- Oh, hi. Anyway, so she went to London to do her masters. -Then to China. -Wait for me. It was just after they left... ...so most of them never seen a white woman with blue eyes before. I don't wanna be catty but did you see what Samantha was wearing the other day? Where are we going? -Home. -Hey. It's just me. Don't sneak, Eddie. Well, don't panic, Lois. How we doing? Wonder how much we'd make if we actually opened the door of that place. -You should put that in a bank. -Don't trust them. You here to supervise? No. I need some of your share back. Bill's got a deal, he's buying a business. It's a heck of a plan. Give me ten cans apiece and you won't believe the return. Use your own share. It's not enough. Come on, Lois. Eddie, this is mine. I don't wanna pass this up. And neither should you. Good morning. Good morning. Call your brother. No. Joey's got to learn how to handle his own life. Well, I want us to help them. I want us to move him out of that place. -Did you offer that? -Yes, I did. I promised it. He betrayed me. He sat there on the phone while Roman made a tape of me... ...implicating me in attempted murder. An attempted murder committed, I might add, by his crazy wife. Well, everything on that compound is damaged. For you to expect Joey to be unscathed, it's not realistic. He's broken, and the longer we stay entangled, the worst our lives will be. -He has always let me down. -No, Bill. He has always, always tried to please you. You put too much on him. You're leading a "Let's save Joey again" project. Barb, you can't do that. Let him sink or swim on his own. What is one plus one? Two. Very good. Your tie is fine. What is one plus two? Could you redo it? Fine. Come here. You don't have to wear this. You can put on your play clothes. That's what so great about school at home. Aren't we going shopping? I can't. Wayne, what are you doing at home? -Mother's gonna be my teacher now. -What? Do Barb and Bill know? Well, it's only summer sessions, Margene. Whoa, Nelly. Look, it's recess, sweetie, okay? What is the matter with you? Why are you so anti-Catholic? It's a gutter religion, Margene. All those women and their crucifixes. I mean, you might as well wear an electric chair around your neck. You know... ...I've been to the compound, Nicki. I wouldn't throw stones if I were you. And their superior hairdos. And their ridiculous extravagant churches. People in your religion act 1 0 times more superior and judgmental. In my religion? May I remind you that you were baptized in our swimming pool into our faith. I know. I'll still never act like a fakey: "Oh, I'm so good and humble" uptight sacrificer. Go confess your sins. I may conquer Satan. I will speak to him as a servant of.... -I'm so sorry. -You know I would do anything... ...to help you out, Sarah. But I cannot have her screaming like this. Yeah, I know, no. She will not tire out. Rhonda, hey, let me in. Only Sarah. Tell him to back away from the door. Back away. Okay, it's just me. He tried to rape me. He came in here last night. He said that I belong to him and he got on top of me. But I punched at him and I asked for Jesus' protection again and again. And he finally stopped. What do you want? I want to go to Heather's. -This one. -The one next to it. -Are you sure? -Oh, I have a very good feeling about it. Are you coming again tomorrow? Yes. -I'd like to give you my phone number. -Could I get-- Okay. That's good. You want some pie, right? Dr. Strachner to the solarium. Dr. Strachner to the solarium. -Hi, Barb. -Hi. I don't like the sleeping pills. But I do feel really rested. That's good. Have you seen Joey Jr.? Joey says he's doing really well. He's fine and that's partly why I came to talk to you. I don't know how to say this so I'll just say it. Lois is trying to get Joey to take a second wife. But he doesn't want to and I can, when you're released... ...set you and Joey up off the compound. No, thank you. Wanda, I know you're afraid Joey can't make it out there, but he can. I can help him. It would mean so much to him if he knew you'd do it. I know Joey doesn't want anyone else. But I've had a lot of time to think in here. And let's face it, Barb. I could be in and out at places like this for my entire life. And Joey needs someone to look after him... ...plus he can't really handle a baby alone. I guess that's quite practical of you. The doctor in here says I exhibit a mordant a sense of reality. It's sweet of you to be concerned. But I know what I want. Who's Lois pushing on him? Kathy Marquart. She's nice. Eddie, listen to me. I'll give you seven and a half percent. Eight, okay. Eight. -But that's it. You better call me. -End of new messages. Come on in. The Taliban princess is yours. -Don't call her that. -Sorry. Where is she? So Scott didn't come to your rescue? -He tried. -I'm your last option. I'm tired of being your last option. -Don't cry. I-- Don't cry. -I'm not. Hi. Hi. Get some sleep. Bill. Bill. Bill. -Did you get the dog? -Bill, it's Barb. -Barb? -I'm sorry. -What is it? -Joey's here. I don't wanna talk to Joey. I went to the hospital yesterday to talk to Wanda. I tried to get her to leave the compound but she doesn't want to. And she wants Joey to take a second wife. Okay. Joey will be heartbroken. -You tell him. -I told you not to get involved. But you can't resist him, can you? No. How do you sleep with that? Sweetie, stop snoring. He idolizes you. I know. You need to make up with him because he leans on me otherwise. You have to help him. Can't we just borrow the money from Lois instead? Eddie, we can't use that money yet. We can't do that. It's just for 30 days is all. We get it back in 30 days. So are you ready to talk? -Don't roll your eyes at me, Joey. -I don't want a lecture, okay, Bill? You're lucky I'm even speaking to you. You put me on that board and you made me a target. -lt was designed to fail. -Everybody's against you, right? -I was trying to help. -No, you weren't. You were doing what you wanted. You put me close to Roman for your interests. I went along because I thought I want the things you do, but I don't. And I don't really care what Roman does or doesn't do on the UEB. I just wanna live peacefully with Wanda. Get your wife to stop poisoning people. I'm trying. Barb spoke to Wanda, she wants you to take on Kathy. She's worried it's the only way that you can be taken care of. Would you like a job? Just a regular job, Joey. We need truck drivers. It's... ...steady. It pays pretty well and you'd be independent. -Bill. -What's wrong? Wayne's run away. Wayne. -Oh, hi, Bill. -Hi, sorry to bother you. Nicki, my neighbor, her son Wayne's gone missing. -I was hoping you'd seen him. -Oh, no, no, I'm sorry. I haven't. -Should you put out an amber alert? -No, no. We're gonna canvass the neighborhood first. I'll call around some of the houses and I'll keep my eye out for him. -Thank you. -You're a really good neighbor. I can't believe it. He was right there. Wayne, Wayne! -Wayne. -He could be anywhere. Wayne. -What have I done? -St. Anthony... ...when you lost your book of prayer you prayed and it was returned. -What are you saying? -Nothing. Stop it. Stop it right now. I'm serious. Would you stop it right now? You slapped me. You are rubbing your blasphemy in my face. -What's the matter with you? -What is the matter with you? He likes the school, Nicki. Wayne likes the school. He wants to go there. Can't you understand that for even a second? Anything? I just knocked on 1 2 doors, Nicki. And every one I had to pretend he wasn't my son. I can't take more. All of I was after is you give me one place I could publicly claim him. I'm going over to Beach Court to lie. Wayne. Wayne. Thank you. Nicki. Nicki. Bill. Can I come in? I want this company as an insurance policy, Don. A way to protect our families. In the past couple years... ...four bingo parlors have opened in the city, another in Provo. They play on credits to get around the state ban on gambling. This state has a thirst for gambling. Two hundred and fifty million dollars spent last year in adjoining states. We can tap that market, Don. It's there. It's waiting. It's ours. I made the offer on Weber Gaming. Okay. I just thought you'd like to know. Okay, thanks. This is about belief, Don. Hey, you guys. Hey, buddy boy, you look great. Are you ready? Hi, I'm Bill Henrickson. -I'm Wayne's father. -Yes, Wayne, he's very good. Here you are. Thank you. You're welcome.
