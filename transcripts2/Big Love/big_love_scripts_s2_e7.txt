 -Look at me. -Yeah. -Hello. -There you are. I have been trying to catch you. Where have you been? -I'm fine, Mom. How are you? -Never mind. -They're repainting. -What? They're repainting this stupid one-bedroom apartment. It's three coats to cover these grubby walls. I can 't stand the fumes. I'm getting in my car, I'll be there by 3. -There where? - Your house. What the heck? Get off my big duff, finally come see you. -T oday? -No, next year.

 My mom' s coming. All right. We have to get things right this time. Things didn't go so well with Barb's family. Well, that was just unfortunate. I want her to get to know Barb and Nicki first as individuals... -...then we'll have the conversation. -Yes... ...then maybe we won't be damned to hell... ...and I won't be referred to as the harlot. I'm excited. I'm just all.... Me too. Hello, my darling. Frank.

 You didn't come to see me. Why should I come to see you? I'm busy. And don't you go making yourself at home. I'm leaving. You know, if you'd come rub my feet.... I am not gonna rub your dirty feet. Lydia Volmer said you had a fur coat. Nita sees you buying a brand-new fancy snowmobile. Looks like we've done quite a bit of decorating here. Mamma mia, spicy new furniture. -Where'd you get this stuff, Lois? -I bought it. Where'd you get the money? -I opened a little Laundromat. -And where'd you get that? I don't owe you any explanation. -Eddie helped me. -You're in cahoots with that cocksucker? That was 27 years ago. -Now, could you just move off it? -Lois, I'm your lawfully wedded husband. I'm entitled to 50 percent of all your possessions, one-half. Here. There's 50. Go on. Beat it. Why didn't you tell me Roman and the Greenes were going after Weber Gaming? What business is it of yours who the others were? It's plenty my business if you give the Greenes my name. -They branded my ass. -And I could have protected you. Hollis and Selma Greene are terrified of Roman Grant. Evoke that name, they run away. Lovely, I'm sure. But it's my company, and I'm tossing it in the air. You can all have a nice free-for-all. We've got Articles of lncorporation before the secretary of state. Thirty days and our deal's done. And I'll take care of the Greenes. -This is Hollis Greene. -Hollis. -Sir? -Bill Henrickson. I spoke with Roman. I told him of your prior claim on Weber Gaming. What did he say? He refused to reconsider, despite some dissent from the board. As you know... ...many board members have historical and familial ties to Ciudad Greene. It is an unethical corporate raid. We have trained some spectacularly fine men... ...with highly unusual asset strengths. If we don't prevail on Weber, we'll crumble. I sure wish I could do more. You, sir, have no need to apologize. You, sir, are a gentleman and an honorable businessman. Juniper Creek, however, is a sinkhole of apostasy. What are we going to do about it? Thank you for your time, very truly yours, Hollis Greene. Carter, you built Weber Gaming up from nothing... ...put it in safe hands. Someone who will protect your legacy. That's me and you know it. Do l? I think there's a case to be made you're all off your rockers. No. I'm the good guy. Yeah. You're playing with fire. You're inciting them, Bill. I'm exploiting the bad blood between the Greenes and Roman... ...to make them go away. There's a fine line between that and egging them on. I know what I'm doing. And this is the backyard. Oh, lookit. Lookit, a pool. Looks just like the penguins' exhibit at the zoo. You know how penguins go? Do you know penguins, Aaron? They go like this: March of the Penguins. Did you take him to see it? I saw it. You don't have to see it. They go like this: I.... I can't believe you're actually here, Mom. Had some grandsons to see, didn't l? And my house. I've never had a home for you to visit either. -Kind of crowded back here. -Oh, we're very close. I can't wait for you to meet them. I don't know, Margie. It's not good to be so close to the neighbors. Who knows what could happen and then... ...you're on the outs. They're great. We're gonna have dinner with them tonight. Barb lives in this house. Nicki lives in this one. They're kind of conservative. We don't drink. Oh, no. I brought us two bottles of Stoli. I'm pregnant, Mom. -That is an old wives' tale. -And no coffee. -No caffeine. -Well... ...at least you can smoke. Jesus Christ. Mom, no bad language. Mom, come on. But do you love him, Margie? Tell me you love him. I love him, Mom. Then I'm happy. I'm happy. March of the Penguins. FBI Director Dylan will be in Salt Lake City today. His visit is part of a nationwide tour of FBI field offices. Agents say the director's visit is not specific to any one event... ...however, the Salt Lake office is one of the main field offices... ...involved in the manhunt for fugitive polygamist leader Orlean Abbot. So we cut out the pictures and decoupaged them to the mugs. We stenciled some plates too. We do an awful lot of projects together. Sounds like a load of fun. Oh, it is. We have such a good time. Tell them about the time you thought you had a big head... ...and then tell them what I said. When I was in fifth grade, I thought I had a big head. Like this: She wore her hair to try and hide it. What'd I say? Mom said I could have a craniotomy. There's no such thing. Right? There's no such thing. Oh, please, I love her to pieces. Who wouldn't? Ginger, Margie and I would like to welcome you to our home. Are we gonna pray again? He likes to pray. Prayer is not a stranger in any of our homes, Ginger. Well, good for you. Nice beans, Nicki. This can't be easy for you. Living between two such attractive single women. Nicki has made a delicious cobbler for dessert. -I hear you're quite the baker. -Me? Mom... ...telephone. Oh, almost forgot. If I would have been invited to the wedding, I would have brought it then, but.... Would you look at your hair. You have absolutely beautiful hair. Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous. And so shiny. Pizza stone. Thank you. -Hello, Barb. -Joey? I got some good news. They're discharging Wanda tomorrow. Joey, that's-- That's wonderful. I'm really glad. Yeah, they say she's good now. But I'm on a run up to ldaho... ...do you think you could go get her and take her home? Tomorrow? Yeah, it meant a lot to her when you came and visited her at the hospital. Joey, I don't know. You know how I feel about the compound. It's just two hours there and back. Well, I need to talk to Bill about it. Why? I've never been to the compound alone. -Okay. -No, no, no. I'll do it. It's all right. Barb, thank you. Do you like Barb and Nicki? Yeah. They're okay. But I gotta hand it to you, Margie. I didn't think you had it in you, but you did it. You got the handsome husband... ...kids and the house, a pool. Your figure. The whole nine yards. I tip my hat to you, honey. Mom. Thank you. -They all liked you, I could tell. -I did good? -You did great. -Good. -Good night, honey. -Good night, Mom. -I think we should forget about telling her. -Why? You know, it just.... It isn't the right time. She's only here for another two days. I think it's enough we get her to like everyone. -We can tell her later. -Don't backpedal, Margene. I mean, we can't keep this shameless charade going on forever. What if she doesn't accept us, Nicki? Ultimately, we can't control her response. But she's your mother, she deserves to be taken into our confidence. What if she's not ready? Whatever you do, I love you, Margie. Then I made up my mind, I'll tell her next time. Happy? Oh, my God. The whole nine yards. Who's my baby? Who's my sweet little baby? Yes. -What are you doing? -Conducting an audit. I wanna see just exactly how much money... ...you got in this little enterprise of yours. And I want it backed up with records. I don't have to show you a thing. Give me my braid. I wanna see your bank statements, woman. -I don't have a bank. -What are you talking about? You can't do business without a bank account. You can if I say you can. If you don't have a bank... ...then where are you hiding all the dough, huh? Frank. Frank, I'm warning you. Where'd you get that thing? That thing happens to be your grandson. I made a couple of calls. Turns out your brother, the cocksucker... ...Ieft Canada under some truly suspicious circumstances. -Mr. Perry Mason. -Hey, let me tell you something. You're gonna tell me where the loot is... ...or I'm gonna beat you to kingdom come. Do you understand that, my darling? I'm worried there could be another Waco. Everyone's nervous. I'm thinking of sending Vernie and Jo Jo to Montana... ...to stay with Vernie's sister till the dust settles. The worst part is the perception. That we're all like that. We shouldn't go after a business that has the Greenes and Roman squaring-off over it. We are going after a perfectly legal business in a perfectly legal way... ...in an industry that is comfortable with doing business with people like us. The government is out to wipe us off the face of the Earth. They have been for 1 50 years. And drawing attention to ourselves at this particular point in time does not feel safe. We're not Orlean Abbot. We're not Hollis Greene or Roman Grant. The only three that want this business are Roman, the Greenes and you. What does that say about you? In gaming there are no good guys and bad guys... ...just dollars and cents. Or maybe good guys shouldn't play this game. Did you ever think of that? Good morning. -I had a wonderful night last night. -Good. You know, we're awfully fond of Margene. Well, I'm glad. She needs all the help she can get. Yeah. -What do you mean? -She's so blind. And so naive. In what way? She's always clung to men... ...and the wrong type. Something's going on between Bill and Barb. And from the look of it, it's been going on for some time. Oh, I don't think so. I saw them kissing. All that so-called praying. I could tell there was something about Bill. Something too good to be true. Ginger, don't assume things based on what you think you saw. Poor Margie. She's just a simple child. Always drawn to losers and oddballs. Well, maybe it isn't exactly what you think. What do you mean? -You know something. -No, I don't. -Yes, you do. -No. Please tell me what you know about my baby. No.... You need to talk to your daughter. Whatever it is, Margie will hide it from me. -Look, I can't, Ginger. -Please. I know you care about her. You've been a good friend. Barb and Bill are married. Bill and Margie are married. What are you telling me? They all sleep together? No. We take turns. We're polygamists. -Yes.... -Yes what? Say again. We're polygamists. Jesus. Would you go in and help get Joey Jr. with me? I'd rather not see Lois. It'll make things easier. She thinks I'm an unfit mother. Could you come in and back me up? -Wanda. -Hi, Lois. I'm back. -Hello, Lois. -Barbara. -What on earth are you doing here? -I brought Wanda back home. We came here to get Joey Jr. Well, he's perfectly fine. He's napping. I'd like to see him. Don't go waking him up, Wanda. I think she's saying that she wants her baby, Lois. Excuse me, is your name Wanda? Well. Well, well. The little loca is back. Frank... ...I'm sorry for what I did to you. I learned I was just projecting my anger onto you. Take me home, I mean it. Take me home. Lay off, Frank. She deserves a second chance. I don't believe in second chances. Lois. She tried to kill me. Get. Put the shotgun away, Lois. Oh, yes, let's just talk together, Barbara, that'll work. Why do you have to behave that way? He's my husband. You think Frank is just some harmless blowhard, don't you? You're wrong. I'll be in the car. We need to get you and the baby home. Talk to accounts receivable, make sure they're all up to speed. If there's a problem, we can just put them on a payment schedule. Mr. Henrickson? Hi, I'm Scott Quitman. I'm a friend of Sarah's. -Your daughter is in danger. -Where is she? No, she's all right, but Albert Grant has been following her. I don't know why she doesn't wanna tell you herself... ...but I guess she doesn't feel she can. What is your relationship to my daughter? Well, we've.... We've been seeing each other. Listen, he's followed her twice, to my knowledge. Once a couple of weeks ago and then last week. Last time, l.... I followed him. Look, Sarah doesn't know I'm here. I see. I just thought I should bring this to you before the police. Thank you. Grandma's here. Hi. Lunch is served. So Little Miss Perfect isn't so perfect anymore. -What are you talking about? -I know... ...everything. I'm sorry. I was gonna tell you. How could you do this to me? We are four people who are devoted to each other. Spare me the details. No, Mom, we're gonna be together in this life and the next. -Don't make fun of my beliefs. -It's not a belief, it's perverted. How is being married to three people I'm devoted to... ...worse than your revolving door of boyfriends? How could you say that to me? I didn't raise you like this. Well, let's not talk about how you raised me, Mom. -Hi. -I'm out of here. You, wait. How could you do this? -She made me tell her. -We talked about it. Don't pin this on me. She caught them kissing. She is your mother, Margie. At least Nicki had the guts to tell me. -Out. Get out. Mom-- -Marge, I can help. -I want you out of my house now. Mom-- -l, for one, certainly am not staying. -Marge, we can make this work. -No, we can't. You ruined it. You've ruined everything. I hope you're happy. No, Bill. Don't you ever go near my daughter. I'm close to all my mothers. Except my mom. Oh, you poor baby. You didn't get all the love you needed, did you? What are you doing? -Talking to Nicki. -No, not you. Your mother is staying with me. -Unbelievable. -On the day bed. In my front nook. You are unbelievable. She has nowhere else to go. She lost her job. The casino let her go. You aren't staying with Nicki and not talking to me. Well, I won't stay with you. You don't know what she's like. Look, she just broke up with her boyfriend. He's moving out of her apartment today. She is a victim of a permissive culture. Oh, this is not fair. This is not right. Marge, one of the advantages of polygamy is we get to share our mothers. Oh, shut up, Nicki. I want you out. Marge, she's the only mother we have left. I like Nicki. Why do you like Nicki? You said we were perverted. Nicki can't help it. She was born into it. She's not staying with you. -Get up. Get up. -No. No. Come on, get up. You are coming in my house. Mom, stop it. You're embarrassing me. Oh, I'm embarrassing you. I love you, honey, but I can't stand it when you get like this. No. No, you cannot go in there. -I want you to leave. -Honestly, Marge. For pity's sake. No. She's not your mother, Nicki... ...and if I say she should go, she should go. The fugitive, Orlean Abbot, was arrested overnight at 4 a.m... ...during a routine traffic stop in Albuquerque. Now, of course, we 've been following this story for months now... ...but finally today, the polygamous leader has been arrested. A t the time, he was driving an unregistered Lexus SUV... ...and also carrying $ 1 80,000 in cash. We have Trey Fonseca on the ground in Salt Lake City. Trey, what do you have? What's the latest here? Larry, we've actually just received some footage... ...from the New Mexico highway patrol that shows the aftermath of that arrest. Now the sideshow. Weeks of coverage with our worst face forward. I heard they're taking him to Guant?namo. I can't believe it's come to this. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here... ...have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. Daddy, what are you doing home from work? Teenie, I need to speak to your sister for a minute. -What'd you do? -Nothing. Scott came by to see me today. What did he want? He told me about Alby. Sarah, why didn't you come to me? It didn't occur to me that I should be frightened of my uncle. You should have told me. You used to trust me. Until you're 1 8, away at college, and in my mind married... ...I'm here to protect you, honey. You've gotta feel free to talk to me. Daddy, how can you protect me from who we are? I will protect you from any threat. Never forget, you are first in my heart. -Where's Wanda-Wanda? -She took Joey Jr. to the park. Why don't you try leaving her alone? Where is your husband? Home. You really shouldn't be here without him. You're a bully who terrorizes his wives. Oh, excuse me. My wives adore me. You know, in this religion, girlie... ...God gave men the power. And if you don't like it... ...then perhaps you should find yourself another religion. That's your perversion of this religion. You think Bill's so different from me? You think he's all sunny boy? When you married Bill, ma'am... ...you married this place. My husband is nothing like you. Really? I see how hard this has been on you. I told Bill... ...you would never be ready for this. But he was never gonna change those stripes. But you know what? You almost had him... ...all to yourself. Almost made it right under the wire, but: You know what? You tell Wanda-Wanda... ...I wanna see her. -I don't want you there. -I can't leave her here alone. And now Joey's not getting back until midnight, maybe morning, so.... I don't understand why you went there in the first place. Well, I just wanted to take care of it so you wouldn 't have to. Because every time you come here... ...you bring it back home. It just doesn't affect me like it does you. -Yeah, right. -lt doesn't. -It's not a good time for you to be there. -Why not? Alone, it just isn't. I mean, with this Abbot thing and night patrols... ...and the friction between Nicki and her family, it's not a pleasant place. I am aware that it's not a pleasant place, Bill. -Who are you talking to? -Barb. Wait, just-- Where are you? I've been waiting for you. -Where is she? -I'm at the compound. -What are you doing at the compound? -Helping Joey and Wanda. -What's going on? -Marge got into a fight with her mom... -...and she walked out on her. -What? I'm trying to smooth things over. She's staying with me. What are you telling him? -Why'd you fight with your mother? -Nicki told her before I was ready... ...now she hates me and thinks we've been keeping secrets. -Nicki. -Not true. -I wanna talk to Barb. -No. -Hello? -Hold on, honey. Hello, are you there? -Stop it. -Nicki, what have you done? -Hey, what's going on? -Barb? Yeah, Margie, what's going on? Nicki doesn't have a mom, so she's trying to steal mine. Bill? Bill, are you there? -I'm here, I'm here. -You have got to sort this out. Knock it off, you two. Right now. Nicki, you're not helping the situation. Hang up the phone. Margie, just shape up. What's gotten into you guys? I need you to come back home. No. I won't. Why are you being so insistent about this? Because. You have got to trust my judgment on this, Bill. I will be fine. Let me see it through. I wanna stay. All right. Be careful. Well... ...I gather you think we were trying to put one over on you. Yes, I do. What are you going to do for my daughter? She's not legally married, she has no rights. She has nothing. There's an irrevocable trust set up in Margie's name... ...and in each of the children's. I fund them monthly. I will always protect Margene. And if you died tomorrow? My will is in place that protects my wives and children. Medical care? Covered. COBRA. You made her keep this a secret from me. No, Ginger. It was Margene's decision. That's because she knows she's doing something wrong. Ginger... ...I want you to feel welcome in my homes. I want you to have a wonderful relationship with my sons... ...your grandchildren. We want you part of our family. And I respect your conflicted feelings... ...but I cannot have you in my houses reviling my life or my wife... ...not in front of the children. I love your daughter too much for that. I'm sorry you have to spend the night. I don't mind. Shall we turn on the TV? We're not allowed to watch it anymore. But we have a shortwave radio. Joey likes to listen to ship to shore. Roger that, skipper. We're running a course of two magnetic. ETA to your position is approximately 20 minutes. Don't you ever find it sad here, Wanda? Yes. Any place can be sad though, if it's in you. Coast Guard to Bravo 1, we have two, repeat two vessels.... It's so windy. How come you're so fixated on helping Joey? -I'm very fond of Joey. -ls it because you can't save Bill? I don't know what you mean. I just think maybe Bill's a harder man to love is all. We have you on a 180 bearing. We have a vessel en route. ETA on that is approximately 20 minutes. I saw your light on and brought you a pie. Well, that's so nice. -That's Barb. -Oh, hi, Barb. I'm Kathy. Joey said what a comfort you were to him and Wanda. What did he say? He said how nice you were. -What--? What is it? -Stupid power. -Hey. -Hey what? It's not the circuit breaker. Maybe the wind, probably. Except there's a light on by the shed. Do you have a flashlight? Someone's out there. It's Frank, I know it. Do you have candles, a flashlight, anything? Somewhere. I can't see anything. He's gonna kill me! -Wanda, get over here. -He's gonna grab me! Just stay away from the window and get in the middle-- No, no, no! Hey, it's okay, it's-- It's me. You okay? Bill called and told me to come here straight away. What happened? Oh, Barb. Why are you crying? It's okay, Barb. Everything's okay. Everything's fine. Everything's okay. All right? You all right? Yes? May I help you? Roman Grant, please. Who are you? What are you doing back here? Morning. How are you feeling? I'm good. Thank you. I'm glad. You're a good guy, Bill. Thank you. We ought to go for a roast beef sandwich, go dancing sometime, huh? Hey, come on. We never got a chance to dance at your wedding. I'm glad you're gonna be there for your grandchildren. You really understand women, don't you? Oh, honey. -I try. -Baby, baby. You're a real stud, Bill. How come all the good ones are married? -Ginger, have you been drinking? -Yes. Look, I'm sorry, but you need to go brush your teeth... ...and go to your daughters. If you're staying here, you need to stay at Margie's. Come on. You see. Do you believe me now? Why did you take her side? You were being pigheaded. We're married. She's my mother too. -And she likes me. -Ginger, Ginger, Ginger. I have got to go to work. I've gotta go to work, okay? Gotta go to work. Why didn't you respect me? My wishes? I just think maybe you don't understand her. You've known her all of one day. Still.... Nicki, she has competed with me my whole life. Over boyfriends, the spotlight... ...and now my family. What's she doing? Well, she's tanked. Can't you see? She tipped over. I didn't do anything. You feeling better? -How long will this take? -Soon. You know, you don't always have to hold it together, Barb. How can you raise Joey Jr. here? When I'm here, it taints what we're doing at home. It just makes it feel vile. Don't blame us for not giving up on this place. There was a time before Roman... ...and there'll be a time after. Honey. Honey. -Help me. -Oh, God. An event has transpired that supersedes any issues... ...you and I may have with each other. I'm aware of Abbot's arrest. I would hope my tone communicates an urgency... ...that transcends the arrest of a pervert. The Greenes have crawled back from their disgusting compound in Mexico. Roman, listen to me-- I'm calling an emergency meeting of the UEB. Given your historical ties with this community... ...I would hope you would come. It's like a state of siege. The place is under lockdown. Guards are everywhere. They've parked cars and trucks on the airstrip to keep anyone from landing. -Where's Barb? I can't get through. -She's okay, Bill. She took off. But she's safe? You're sure she's all right? She left about 1 5, 20 minutes ago. Come on. I want to speak to him, let me through. Nobody can speak to him, I'm sorry. Well, I demand to speak to him. I understand, but it's not gonna happen. He just went that way. Tell him Barb Henrickson is here. We cannot let you in. -Barbara. -Hello. -We're in a crisis situation here. -I'll be brief. What you did to me... ...was heartless and cruel. It was a move toward living in the light. You're a false prophet who rules by fear. I'm not afraid of you. I am only trying fitfully and imperfectly... ...to keep the original word alive on the face of this planet. You leave my family alone. I've known Bill all of his life. I've watched him. And I'll always watch him. And by extension, I will always watch over his family. You're my family. Mom. Mom. Mom. Oh, crap. I'm still here. Not for long, Mom. I packed your bags. Mom, I didn't let you know the truth about us... ...because I didn't want you in my life. I know. And I'm not gonna let you make me feel bad about my family. Mom. I'm happy. I'm glad for you. Bill's a good man. And Nicki, the rest. You've found a place where you fit in. We'll add more children. Another wife or two. It doesn't stop. What do you mean another wife? Someday, we'll add a fourth wife. -Do you think that's wise? -I do. -Someone young and pretty? -I suppose. Honey, no. You're in the bird-dog seat. You have all the power. -It's not about power. -Of course it is. Barb and Nicki think they have the power... ...but they don't. Trust me on this. Don't go giving it up so easy. You hold on to what you got here. Absolutely. Assume I'll be packing for home, did you? Mr. Big Shot. I mean, the man is trying to bring down Roman Grant. He's trying to bring down the whole UEB. UEB is worth $200 million. The state of Utah won't touch Roman Grant. You're gonna bring him down all by yourself? Are you kidding me? Good luck. Come here. If I could open up a vein and drain the half of my blood that is yours... ...I'd gladly do it. Gentlemen. The Greenes... ...have invaded and attacked. This is Hollis Greene. In these latter days, woes beset us. Orlean Abbot has been taken down by our foes. God has spoken to us on this. As an exercise of God's righteous will... ... we, Hollis and Selma Greene... ...have been divinely invested to step forward into the breach... ...and hereby announce suzerainty over... ...and demand fealty of all who follow the principle. We stand before you highly resolved... ...that all believers in the principle... ...must recognize the rightfulness of our claims... ... transfer all assets to us, assign all tithing to us... ...and otherwise submit to our rightful and singular authority. We can ill afford an open conflict... ...with the eyes of the government everywhere upon us. We must have nothing to do with them. No business dealings, no social intercourse... ...no communication with them whatsoever. No exceptions. Any contact with the Greenes... ...warrants excommunication... ...and blood atonement. Dear heavenly Father... ...bless Bill, watch over him. If he is an instrument of your will... ...allow me the fortitude to be strong for him... ...and nurture him and offer him the safe harbor... ...the respite he needs for your designated journey for him. In the name of Jesus Christ... ...amen.
