 Amen. Are they feeding you all right? These lights are giving me a headache, though. Why did you tell them you did it, Joey? I made a deal with Roman. There's a company that he wants to buy. And he needs a unanimous vote to get it. He said he'd end the investigation and-- That he'd leave Wanda and me alone if I voted for it. -Did you? -No. Because the state got involved.

 Joey. Wanda can't be in here. She couldn't make it. You really wanna take the fall for this? All right, listen to me. No more decisions without talking to me first, okay? I only slipped up the one time, Bill. That's all. Margene. Well, it's almost 1 0. You should be in bed by midnight. Oh, I know, movie night. You are pregnant. You have to get into a regular schedule while it's still... ...easy to fall asleep. What--? Why aren't you in your own bed?

 Teenie shakes her feet and kicks the wall. -Well, get some earplugs. -I like the couch. You're not getting any sleep worth having sleeping on Margene's couch. You got birthday cards from Grandma Lois and Aunt Cindy. Why don't you open them up now? I'm saving them for my birthday. I've got class. I'll be back for book club at 1. Here's your stencils, start tracing the sheet. Are your brothers coming? Almost. David stopped in Wyoming. Rick and Jesse are still in exile. This court case needs to go away. How involved are you? They could call me to testify but it can't get that far. Your father needs a vote from me. He's gonna have to work hard to get it. He doesn't like to be backed against a wall. I haven't seen some of my family for a long time. Just try and enjoy this, okay? What time is dinner? Mama wouldn't say. She thought the FBl was listening in. What are you doing? Get on out of here. There you go. -Hi, Mama Cinda. -Well, well, well. Thanks for the grapefruit. This is your Aunt Nicolette. -Good to see you. How's Mama? -Stage four. Mama Dee. She told you? Oh, such ridiculousness. Of course he registered his trucks in Nevada. Because it was cheaper. He'd do anything to tear us apart. Shelley, pull that skirt down. -Did you bring the potatoes? -They're in the car. -What's that news truck down the road? -Oh, some media. Thank you Orlean Abbot and the FBl's most wanted. So when you're done unloading, park your car down... ...here by the sheds. This is an emergency lane. Oh, I hope you brought your own towels. -Well, so nice to see you, Bill. -Hi, Adaleen. When was the last time? Oh, yeah. When you broke in through our window. Oh, everybody, if you go out after dark, register. We're putting up night patrols in case of a raid. So be careful. Last thing we need is for someone to get shot between the eyes. Rhonda. When Adaleen called me I wanted to die. Three days on a dirty Mexican bus, young lady. And your father left alone in Chihuahua with those nasty women. You didn't have to come. Oh, really? No one else seems able to get you to do the right thing. I was going to do it soon. When? Being sealed to the prophet is a great honor. I know. So you better still be intact. -All right, read it back so far. -Yes, sir. Dear Senators of the Republican caucus... ...although I'm in agreement that the sacred rights of marriage... ...have been weakened and compromised... ...I vigorously dissent on the wisdom of a proposed constitutional amendment... ...defining marriage as a union of one man and one woman. Fine. Then add... ... by including polygamy on the list of dubious practices... ...you tarnish a religious tradition whose roots are traced... ...to biblical figures... ...such as Abraham, Jacob, Moses... ...defiling them... ...as immoral and dirty. Yes? Is now a bad time? What is it, honey? It's about our stay here. You and Bill? Gentlemen, I'm sorry. Would you excuse us a moment? I got Bill to come and stay in your house tonight. Thank you, Nicolette. I know you'll hold up your end and settle things. Of course. Anything else? No, Papa. Then perhaps you should go and help your mothers with supper. Well, thanks, Papa. She wrote, "You know it's not your fault... ...what happened to your mother and your family." And she hasn't answered one phone call. One phone call since the mess at the governor's mansion. They always work the children, Barb. It felt like paranoia at first... ...but 20 messages with no return calls in almost a month and now this card? It's not like my sister not to call to rub the salt in. She so-- Meddlesome. It's all Larry King and Anderson Cooper's fault. They make us look like retards and perverts... ...over and over with those women and their teeth and those sneakers. If they could show just one normal plural family for a change. -The good ones are all closeted. -Oh, that term. Yeah, I know, it rubs me the wrong way too. Did you try calling her? Twenty times. I can't believe my own family would expose us like that. -But now-- -You can't call her anymore. I know it's hard. It's the not knowing. Honestly, my own mother tried to grab my kids. She followed Ruby around in her Lexus for weeks. You just have to let it go. Who's older, your boy or your girl? Excuse me. I'll give you more. Let him up, now. Ben, you have homework. -I did it already. -Now. You got a C in Spanish. Out. And you have a nursery to finish. So why don't you just go sponge blot those lamp stencils, huh? You're so baby-crazy, Barb. Look at you. He pushed me in. We need to teach Ben priorities, Margie. Okay. There's play time and work time... ...and friend time and family time. You know where I'm going with this? Of course. -Missed a spot. -No, I didn't. Yes, you did. How many ears did you get? Just put it on the counter. There's too much fat on this beast. Alby's poisoning must be a strain on your marriage. Did Joey really do it? I don't think so. How about Wanda? You still close to her? She's a nutcase. What if they're all convicted? You'll have cut them all off, you know. So will Bill. I still need 20 pounds of sugar for the morning. The company is Weber Gaming. They distribute touch screen entertainment devices to six states. You mean video poker machines? Is it legal? Yes. Is it moral? Selling poker machines that live in bars... ...can be set to pay out. Our own UEB promoting liquor and gambling? Well, let me find the morality for you. We bleed money away from those with unholy lifestyles. With it, we support our own. The purchase price is fair. Their clients are fully aware of our background. And have shown no hesitation. It's an investment... ...that will ensure the security of our community... ...and our families. If you'd like to play with one first, Bill... ...I can have one brought down for your perusal. -Alby? -A yea or nay vote only, please. -Yeas? -Yea. Nay. Oh, you can record it. Why is dissent so ingrained in your nature? You made a deal with my brother behind my back. Oh, that's your brother's story. That's my version of it. You fear for your brother's safety in the same way I feared for my son's. My brother's in jail for a crime he didn't commit. This investigation is out of my hands, Bill. I have no power over the state. Figure it out. You know what I want. Bring your offer to the dinner table. -Hello. -Hi. -ls this Kim Lee? - Yes, ma 'am. It's Aunt Barb, is your mom home? One minute, please. She can 't come to the phone right now. Can I take a message? Can you tell her--? Can you tell her it's important? She says she'll call you back. Can--? Can you tell her that her sister Barb loves her... ...and no matter what she's done or what she thinks I've done... ...that we can still make it better. Okay. Bye. What? So you're really gonna let Brynn hang out at your parents' house? My mom invited her over. You still doing it all with her? Not as much. I'm working on it, it's not that easy. Well, it's okay, you know, I get it. It's not totally your fault-- It's a lot because of her father's choices. All done. Do you think your dad's leading you guys down an unrighteous path? No. Why? Because I think my Dad is. What's he doing? Most people believe... ...you should only have one wife. Smokers, drinkers, sex, fags. What our dads are doing... ...you and l, we can't have it. That's them. I'm doing my own thing. Yeah, but you know what? The thing is we're still screwed up by it. Every time I come over Margene's running around... ...in a skirt or robe or whatever. -Are you complaining? -No. You know, she's hot but she's your mom. It's the house your dad made for you. -You gonna shave your head now too? -No, it's not like that. -You know, you should come with me. -Where? To a venue in Mari, there's gonna be bands, we're gonna go, hang out. You should come and pledge Straight Edge. You should make it your second family. No drugs, no meat... ...no liquor, no cigarettes, you can quit it with Brynn. I can work on Brynn on my own, all right? It's not my folks, it's me. I'll fix it. I promise. Same one, same place, half price. No thank you, sir. -You still need to take the pledge. -Oh, yeah. He's looking out for you, friend. Eight years. That will be 50 bucks. Whatever you have to say... ...I will hear with an open heart. I've prayed to be worthy of you. And I heard an answer from the holy spirit that it is time. You must be certain... ...that it's absolutely of your own free will. It is. I'm not just some old rake to you? Angels will sing for us. Hello? Mom? You're not my mother. -I'm Rae. -Bill? Eddie? Honey. Sorry. She's a new wife. Got two and holding. Well, hey. Hey. -How long you been here? -Oh, just a week. Just trying out my new rig. It's got satellite TV, a pop out and solar battery recharger. And I got a few new things for your mom. You know, I finally sold the Western Press and the ranch. You're too young to be an idle old rich man. -How long you staying? -A couple of weeks. Eddie? It's getting late. That will clean out every last double load dryer. Look, I'm not going back down to "whoreville" now. I'll roll the quarters but-- -Bill. -Whoreville? Yeah, we got a little Laundromat off the interstate in a strip mall. It's not the... ...best part of town, it's good for business. You don't wanna be where people can afford their own washers and dryers. You have a Laundromat? Well, you thought this was something you should hide from me? I'd-- Of course not. Well, how did you get start-up money? For your information, I got a SBA loan. And Eddie's been advising me. Don't worry about it. You got your own life elsewhere. But you lied to me. Don't you embarrass me in front of my brother. I don't have to tell you every single little thing I do. I gotta depend on myself... ...for the cash do-re-mi bucks to keep us afloat. So where's Wanda? How should I know? Well, you can't let her wander around here unsupervised. I'm here trying to help Joey. Stop attacking me. It so happens that I'm so worried about your brother... ...that I don't sleep nights. Rae, off the leather. You're wet, honey. These mine? Yeah. What is that? Hang on. Who's that? Hello. It's Margene Heffman. Margene? Barb's sister-wife. -Well, holy cow. Go on, sweetie. -Excuse me? I'm sorry. What goes on... ...between my sister and me stays in Vegas. If that means it's none of my business, you're wrong. We're a family. And you and I are sister-in-laws. Oh, we most certainly are not. I know that you don't approve of us. But if ever a sister needed a sister, it's now. And I am telling you, Barb is the sweetest, most loving... ...and supportive sister-wife ever put on this green earth. And I just-- I love her so much. So much you didn't even know. How old are you, sweetheart? What difference does that make? This isn't junior high and these aren't your little sleepover girlfriends. Grow up. And never, ever call my house again. Hey, Cindy. Everyone, it's called curry. So here's what you do. You get your plate, you put your Uncle Ben's on it. And then serve your chicken with curry sauce. You take your mandarins, coconut and pineapple tidbits, okay? All right. Delicious. Where should we go? Front and center. Okay, here's how it goes. It's kind of complicated so try to follow along. I'm 32 of 56 children. And when I married Roman, I became my own step grandma... ...because my father married Roman's daughter, Bayleen. Would you care for a biscuit? Mom tell you about Rhonda? What now? We'll have a new mother by tomorrow night. That woman. Dad's marrying down. Do you want to sell pine nuts on the side of the road in Mexico? Do you? Go on. There's still space. Go on. Pass the salt, Roman. Making eyes at Papa? You'll never be daddy's little girl. No. I'll leave that privilege to you. So, little Josie, that makes you my step grandma... ...and I'm your step mom. And when I had Alby he became my great uncle... ...and I became his great, great grandmother. Which of course, makes me my own grandmother. Bill. I hope Nicki packed your best whites. I don't take a very good picture. I brought my white dress, Mama. Good. This may very well be our last family photo... ...before we all meet up again on the other side. For all we know Jesus could be back by Labor Day. Aren't we glad my dear sweet son... ...survived the vicious attack on his person. Any word on who really did it? That is a very smart apron, Adaleen. Stop begging. There you go. I've called for a second UEB vote tomorrow at 2. So if your feelings on Weber Gaming have changed... ...our family will let bygones be bygones. Well, the minute the charges are dropped... ...you'll have my vote. It's not much of a case if there's no complaining witness. -Papa. -You will clear Joey Henrickson... ...of any liability by morning. Perhaps you should go to the Meeker Courthouse now. Your mother will wrap you a plate. Listen to your father, Alby. Don't you tell me what to do. We're having a lovely time. It's disgraceful. Son. Calm down. I will not do it. You should consider your own son's well-being. -I won, obviously. -Yeah. Thought you were saving them. Sarah says Grandma put 1 00 bucks in her birthday card. -ls that true? -Maybe. -Holy crap. -Hey, watch it. You know, I should go home. No, it's Saturday. Stay. If you quit, doofus wins. Well, I concede Africa to Sarah Henrickson. What did she have to say? Nothing. No money. Thank you, Mrs. Henrickson. I had a great night. Come back for family-home evening on Monday. Seven? Yeah, something like that. -Benny? -I'm just gonna walk her out. --last girlfriend called him on the phone and said.... Anything you need? No, your wives have made us very comfortable. Do you ever watch this program? Afraid not. Where's your dirty mind? There better not be nobody-- Best to give it all to me and nobody else but me. Is this still a jackpot--? -Newlyweds. -I'll be gone by the afternoon. If we're gonna make a deal, it needs to happen by then. All protestations stamped out. Have you met my youngest, Emmet Grant? I haven't. All these fights we're having, Bill... ...over money, business, worldly things... ...don't let them cloud your judgment. Family is first. Roman, fix this thing. Good night. Good night. -What? -What? Oh, for Pete's sake. What are they doing now? -Nothing. -You don't have to protect him or her. She's keeping him up late. She should be in bed. I'll go get him. -How did you know I was here? -You weren't in the room. Barb just called... ...she wanted to say good night. And what were you talking to my dad about? Trying to settle things for Joey. -Do you need me to do something? -No. I'll vote for his dirty little poker machines. Do you ever miss this place? Sometimes. What about you? Oh, I've given up hundreds... ...to live in the suburbs with ten. Do you regret it? No. You know, I can't be in that picture with you tomorrow. Yeah, I know. Come here. Stop. -Bill. -Come on. -Stop. -What? Do you think a man should have to love a woman... ...to marry her? Yes. And the other way around. Pull out a suit for him. You will go in to Meeker and confess... ...that you consumed the antifreeze yourself... ...in a desperate attempt for attention. Joey Henrickson and his family were your scapegoats. The UEB vote is tomorrow at 1. This will be resolved by then. Try and kill me again. By rejecting my holy authority you threaten your own legacy... ...your wives, your property and your eternal salvation. Capitulate now. What are you doing? Making a sweater for Bill. But it's a surprise. Not a peep. Ben, go home and get a shirt on. -We're studying. -Ben. Go. Yes, ma'am. What? Sarah saw you and Ben up at midnight. No way. Then one of you is lying. You and I need to go shopping. Get me when you're ready. What did I do? -What do you think she's mad about? -I don't know. I didn't do anything. Well, then, go out with her. Make her buy you lunch or something. Just call her for me. Get me out of this, please. Margie, I can't come between you and Barb. You know I can't intercede. Hold on, here's Nicki. Listen to me, Margie. I'm sure you're innocent. But you have to tell me what she thinks you did. She's blaming me for Ben getting a C in Spanish. What? No, that is not a shopping trip offense. It has to be something much, much worse. -Now, what did you do? -I don 't know. She's never taken me shopping before, she's making me go. You have every right to be offended. They are horrible. Just use the " It's difficult being third wife" line. She can't stand it. Oh, Nicki, I don 't know. Just please come home. -I don 't wanna go. -Relax. Don't back down, she smells weakness. Now go. Barb. I'm not going shopping with you. If you have something you wanna say to me, you can tell me right now. Margie, we're going to Dillards. Get ready, now. We'll pick out a nice new sweater for Bill. No. I know I embarrassed you because I was loud and you had a book thing. We should have gone inside. I'll be stricter. I want Ben to get into the Academy too. I do. I'm sorry. There. The end. No. That's just one little thing. -What then? Is it the phone call thing? -What phone call thing? Nothing. I'm not gonna go. I'm not going. Is it the sprinkler thing? No, that's not it either. Go, put on some pants and get in the car. Why are you doing this to me? Fine, Margie. I feel your relationship with Ben is inappropriate. What do you mean inappropriate? It's blatant. How do you think it looks to outside eyes? What conclusions do you think they draw? Like-- Yes. Do you think that too? Look, let's just go to the mall and get an orange Julius. How could you say something like that? About me and Ben? That's so disgusting. I've just been trying to be a good mother to my boys, to yours. All right. Let just discu-- Let just keep our voices down. No. You're wrong. And you're gross. And that sweater thing was my idea, not yours, just like the nursery. Knit your own sweater, Boss Lady. Margene? Open this door. Mother Barb. Wayne, go inside. Your mother's under Roman's thumb here and Frank's when he bothers to show up. Yeah, but a Laundromat? It's easy to run, it's low on labor, it could be her road to independence. And I'll watch out for her. Dig your own grave. Call me if you need an accountant. This is a popular machine. I see them all over Arizona. How is it that gambling went from being a sin... ...to just another form of entertainment? That's brown, Albert. Whites only. Get your wives to dress you proper. How's Papa today? I haven't seen him. What have you done? I'm the victim here. You and Bill and our father are the ones wearing guilt. Get over it. You didn't die. So it's only our father who has the moral fiber to feel his guilt. Go play make-believe with your wives or I'll scream. Papa is the one who did it. When Rhonda came back from your homes... ...she told them all about Barb's little ceremony. He called them. He publicly exposed your family. Put you in harm's way. Without a second thought. You're a liar. I went to the state police like Papa told me to. I told them all about the deal he's trying to make with Bill today... ...to cover up what happened to me. I told them Bill was here. Right now. There will be no peace here today, not at my expense. A message for your husband... ...there are repercussions for robbing a man of his dignity. Don't do this, Alby. Remember that I was kind to you today. I warned you the police are on their way. Ever knock? I saw you last night before I came and got you. Benny? Remember when they said it was better to see your sons and daughters... ...come home in wooden boxes than to have them give up their chastity? Do you think I'm going to hell? I don't know. I don't think so. But I'm not Mom and Dad. Just be careful. Hey, where are you? What's wrong? I wanna go with you tonight. Look, you can't just be a tagalong, Ben. If you can 't condemn it, then you condone it. If you can 't quit... ... then you 're part of the problem. This is for real. I know. I wanna go with you. Can you come pick me up, please? All right, get ready. Okay, no crown colors or no school T-shirts... ...and nobody finds out where we're from. Okay? Nicolette. My, you look beautiful in that white dress. Papa. Honey, what's wrong? -Did you do it? -I don't know what you mean. Did you expose Barb? My family? Who told you this? We don't live here on the compound. We're not protected like you are. We could all be put in prison or worse. And Papa? Nicolette... ...you will not go spreading false rumors. Understood? -What's going on? -We have to leave. -Well, I can't. I have the UEB meeting. -No, Bill, now. Why? Tell me. I hope you told the state police about you and Papa's cover-up. They're coming here now. Does your father know? Why aren't you down there? Come on. -Where are you going? -We're leaving. You will be in this photo. The photographer's come all the way from Denver. Look at me, young lady. -Nicki, what's wrong? -Nicki, stop. Just talk. -Always a scene. -Always trouble. One day you'll realize the importance of family... ...and won't it just be too late. Shame. Shame. Shame. State police are on the way here right now. You want to use that tongue? Use it on your son. Look here. Can I have a minute with your mom? Drama. I'm not sorry I did it. Good for you, Margie, then you're paying to replace the grass. No. You were wrong. I know Ben and l are only five years apart. And I am attractive, I just am... ...but I'm his mother. And I know that. I know you know that. He got beat up at a concert with Jason, did he call you? -What happened? -He's just having trouble fitting in... ...finding his place. He called me. And I picked him up. Most kids would have hidden it from their moms. -But he called me. -Where is he? He's cleaning up. He's fine now. I'm just saying... ...maybe I'm close to him in a good way. He needs you. Maybe he needs me like a third mom too. He has to sleep in his own bed from now on. Benny. -Yes, ma'am? -Are you okay? Yeah. I'll tell him. -Hello. -Tom, listen. -I need you to come into work tomorrow. -What's wrong, Bill? I'm thinking about pulling the plans on the third store. What happened up there? What if there's a way we could take the pressure off our families... ...from all the hiding we've had to do to protect the stores. Hiding is part of our lives. Maybe, maybe not forever. What if we purchase a company whose clients didn't mind that we're polygamists? And where would we find that? What do you think about video poker machines? Exclusive distribution in six states. I don't know that I'm comfortable with gambling, Bill. Times are changing, Don. Let's face it. We don't have the same options as other businessmen have. This could be our insurance policy. In case these public exposures continue we'd be safe. Our families would be safe. I need to think about it. Think about it. I'll see you tomorrow. I'm home.
