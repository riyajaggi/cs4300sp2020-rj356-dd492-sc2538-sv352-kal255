 Ripped by gabbyu's Subs. Wow, this is a nice car! Look at this. It's so spacious! Don't celebrities ride vans like this? It's so roomy. I love it. It's a nice car, right? I rented it. Hop in, but don't get the seats dirty. Got it. Let's go, guys. This seat is reserved. Get in the back.

 Do you have to be such a jerk? - Am I late? - Hey. We're going to leave right now, so get in. - Did you sleep well? - Yes. I guess we're all going together. Let's go. - Let's eat something delicious. - Sure. What shall we have? What's famous there? Gangneung is famous for tofu soup. - Let's have that. - Hun, did you pack water? Water? It's right here. Maybe we should make some coffee for the ride. How could I forget morning coffee? You want some? - No. - What about a first aid kit?

 All right, that's enough. We can go to any pharmacy if we need one. Why waste money when we have one at home? Can you go get it, Hun? Me? No, why should I? I don't even know where it is. I know where it is. I'll go and get it. - You always pick on me. - What a hassle. Get in the car. Let's get inside. - Hurry. We have to get going. - Okay. I'll keep it in here. Close the door. Good. Does everyone have their seatbelts on? Let's get going then! TURNING POINT A FEW DAYS AGO DEPARTURE: SEOUL ARRIVAL: GANGNEUNG DEPARTURE: SEOUL 9 A.M. Would it be too late if we leave at 9 a.m.? No. It's perfect. We can have lunch as soon as we arrive. FAMOUS RESTAURANTS IN GANGNEUNG There are loads of famous restaurants in Gangneung. What do they have there? Tofu soup, cockles, and stuffed squid. Oh, and we need to have sashimi if we're going to the seaside. But isn't Gangwon Province known for their high-quality beef? Let's just eat everything. But we've only got a day. We just have to be quick. I'll reserve the tickets, so don't you worry. Okay. I'll look up famous restaurants in that area. I'll be late for work. DEPARTURE: GANGNEUNG ARRIVAL: SEOUL I can't believe it's fall already. Found it. FAMOUS RESTAURANTS IN GANGNEUNG FOOD YOU MUST EAT IN GANGNEUNG Is she going on a trip? We'll gather here at 2 p.m. after lunch break. - Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. Good work, everyone. Thank you. Enjoy your meal. - Thanks. - Enjoy. Wow. You know, at first, I had so much trouble getting used to being the swing because I had to memorize all of the dance routines even when I didn't have a part. But now that I'm getting the hang of it, I actually find it pretty fun. It makes me feel like I've become the main character. I like your optimism. Well, without my optimism, I am nothing. Is that what they told you? They suggested I do the swing dance in addition to the ensemble. But do they need two swings? What I'm trying to say is... I am... probably going to get fired, aren't I? The producer told me a few days ago. It's not confirmed, but I thought you should know. I'm telling you just so you don't think I'm stealing your part. But why? I mean, I have come so far. Why hire me if they are just going to fire me? They mentioned something about efficiency. But in the end, it's all about money. You only received the initial deposit, right? That might be your last pay. But... it's not like taking me out of the team will help them save that much money. What's wrong with him? Song-i. Come and sit here. - Do you have something to say to me? - I'm sure you have something to tell me. Are you going to Gangneung with your boyfriend? How did you know? "How did you know?" Are you actually asking me that? You only just started dating him and you're going on a trip? It's not for leisure. It's for a field report. Field report, my ass! You're using the field report as an excuse to spend time with him. How long will you be gone? What do you mean, "how long"? It's a one-day trip. What a load of crap! Do you really think you'll come back in a day when you actually get there? Haven't you seen the movies? You'll end up drinking until the last train, and you'll have missed it by the time you arrive at the station. And you'll find yourself at a motel with only one room left. That is how it'll end. That's his intention and he'll see to it that it happens. Do you really think that will happen? You want that to happen? Just look at you. You'd better cancel the trip. I'm not going to cancel it. I'm not a little kid. Can't I even go on a trip with my boyfriend? It's because he's a pathetic jerk. Song-i, when I think about that night you came home drenched by the rain, it still makes my blood boil. You shouldn't judge someone so easily. I have an eye for people. Just do as I tell you. I don't want you going on that trip. Tell me you won't go. Answer me. SOJU Damn it! What's wrong with him? I don't know. - Hey! - Hey... Don't drink so fast. What is it? What's going on? What are you guys talking about... I thought life would be a bed of roses if I just passed the audition. But there were no roses... in my bed. There was only humiliation. - What's wrong? - I might not get to perform on stage. Why? Because you suck? That's not the reason! I'm just an understudy. I merely act as a substitute for actors if they get injured. That's my role. There's no place for me on the stage. There's not one line for me in the script. My name doesn't exist anywhere. It's as if I'm a ghost. I enjoyed it though. Because everyone starts off with small roles in the beginning. But it sucks to think that I might get fired just so they can save some money. How much is it? How much will they need to keep you? Don't bother. I'm not fired yet. I hate that things always turn out like this. I am sick and tired of it. That's enough of the depressing talk. I'm sorry, guys. I'm going to go to bed. I wish I could go somewhere far away. I think that would make me feel better. Let's go on a trip. A trip? What are you talking about all of a sudden? Song-i's going to Gangneung for her field report. So why don't we all go together? To Gangneung? Well, it's because I'm working on a school project. That sounds fun. I want to go to Gangneung. Come to think of it, I haven't seen the sea in a while. I'll be checking out buildings for the field survey. It's not by the beach. We're going to Ojukheon. I love Ojukheon! Right. Sulking and drinking just because I got a few insults isn't my kind of thing. Let's go and blow off some steam. - Gangneung it is! - Let's do it! Leave the accommodation and car rentals to me. I'll drive too. Let's do this! But there's someone who will be accompanying me. Hey... Gangneung. - Gangneung. - Gangneung. - Gangneung. - Should we ask Do-hyeon to join us? That's a great idea. - Do-hyeon. - Do-hyeon. Do-hyeon. - Do-hyeon. - Do-hyeon. We're all going together? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have given in to the pressure. But Hun and Ga-rin got too carried away. Then you should have said no more firmly. I wanted to, but Hun's having a tough time these days. He was drinking soju out of a cup. I felt sorry for him. I feel sorry for myself. I wanted it to be just us. Me too. But now that we're all going as a group, let's just focus on having fun. Will they believe you if you say that you can't cancel the tickets? The thing is, they've already started packing for the trip. Gangneung, Gangneung! Let's go to Gangneung! I like going on spontaneous trips. And I don't mind getting to know your friends. But you have to reserve a good place to stay for the night. Oh, and... I want my own room. Come on. That's a given. Why do we have to pick her up? What is she, a queen? Hey, watch how you talk to her when she's around. Only I can talk to her casually. You guys should speak to her formally. She's older than us by two years. What was her name again? Ryu Se-hyeon. By the way, does she know that we're all living together? Damn it! Hey! What are you doing? Drive carefully, will you? Jeez, it hurts! All of you... do not tell Se-hyeon that you're living at my place. You haven't told her something that important yet? Gosh, it hurts. I just couldn't find the right moment. What kind of girl would like it if her boyfriend were living with two other girls? Plus, she knows how close Song-i and I are. I'm sure she'll hate that. - Especially you, Hun! - Gosh, what? You'd better not blurt it out after getting drunk. Yes, sir. It's top secret. I get it. I'll keep my mouth shut. I can't trust you. Hey. - Did you sleep well? - Yes. Let me get the door for you. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Hun. Choe Hun. I see. I'm Ryu Se-hyeon. To have someone so shabby in such a noble place... I mean, it's an honor to have a noble person in such a shabby place. Okay. It's nice to meet you. I'm O Ga-rin. Hi, it's nice to meet you too. Song-i, did you receive the file I sent you? Yes, I did. In fact, Tae-o worked on it all night long. Are you done with your introductions? - Yes! - Yes! I like your sunglasses. Can I put them on? Of course. Let's get going then. How about we play some music? Put your seatbelts on. - Guys, fasten your seatbelts. - Okay. Now, turn on the Bluetooth! Let's go! Turn it on. All right. Let's go! One, two, three. Song-i, look at the camera. - One, two, and three. - One, two, and three. Let me see. It's cute, right? - It's nice, right? - It is. Is this a different song? Oh, no. I think my battery is dead. - It looks like it. - But I still have so many photos to take. Didn't you bring a portable charger? There were two in Tae-o's room. Right. I forgot about it. That's a shame. Hey, wait for me! Where's Do-hyeon? He's on the phone with his dad. It's good we all came together. It would've been boring if you'd come to this huge place with just him. It still would've been fun. Yeah, right. What did he say to you when you broke off the trip? He got upset, saying he wanted to go with me alone. He was so cute. I'm telling you, he had other intentions. So what if he did? He's my boyfriend, after all. What about you? Are you going to have a platonic relationship with Se-hyeon forever? How do you not even blush when you say something like that? Sometimes I feel like you're the one who is naive. Get out of my way. I'm going to take a selfie. Cheese. You're so pretty. Let me take a picture of you. Oh, come on. - Coming through! - Coming through. - Charge! - Charge! Hey, Song-i. You should lose some weight. Can't you see Do-hyeon's struggling? See that? - Are you okay? - I'm all right. I'm sorry. - Be more careful. - Okay. Sorry. Let's go. Se-hyeon, look over here. It's like a movie. We're at Ojukheon! Tae-o, isn't the scenery incredible? I'm going to save it in my memory. Hun, I want to go and check this place out. Which place? This one here? It's this one. Let's go together. Hey, we'll be off. See you guys later. - Sure. - Let's go. Let me save you in my memory. I'm going to be studying the architectural style as I look around, so how about we split up and meet an hour from now? All right. Besides, it looks a bit silly to walk around as a group. You guys go ahead and look around. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm coming, too. You can look around first. Okay. Isn't Se-hyeon pretty? You guys look good together. We make such a good-looking couple, right? It's really nice to be away and get some fresh air. It's all thanks to Song-i. Do you know who she was originally planning to come here with? - Her boyfriend, I assume. - Exactly. They were going to go on a trip when they just started dating. I went out of my way to stop her. What's wrong with that? She's not a child. I'm sure that will happen someday. But she can never go with that guy. I told her to break up with him. Excuse me. I'm sorry, but could you please move aside for a bit? Oh, sure. - Thank you. - Thank you. Wow, she's really pretty. Do you think she's a student? - She's so pretty. - Her photos look great. She's pretty in real life too. She's gorgeous. Let's take another quick shot of her. - Okay. - Quickly. Wow. Why don't you go and talk to her? - I can't do that. - I think I'm in love. I admit it. She's pretty. OJUKHEON Does Tae-o find her that pretty as well? I guess he does. That would explain why he did those stupid things for her. That camera looks very familiar. Oh, it's Tae-o's. I often borrow his for my assignments because I don't have my own. How long have you been friends with Tae-o? Since we were three, I think. - Three years old? - We've been friends for quite a while. When did his mom pass away? She passed away around that time. After his mother passed away, I moved to his neighborhood and we soon became friends. I heard that his dad remarried. He remarried when Tae-o was six. He has a younger brother called Yeong-ho. He's in junior high now. He's his half-brother? Yes. It's more complicated than I thought. Regardless, he grew up to be a good guy. He's better than most friends I know. He was never a troublemaker. He does talk back to his dad a bit, - but that's what fathers and sons... - I see. Does Tae-o get lonely often? Everyone feels lonely once in a while, don't they? I hate men who are insecure. I just got curious. Why did you tell her to break up with him? Remember that night when it rained like crazy? It was raining cats and dogs, but he didn't even walk her home. It was their first date as well. Did she get caught in the rain? Yeah, she was absolutely drenched. You should have seen her. Don't get me started. He probably didn't know. Even if that was the case, that's no excuse for a guy who's only just started dating her. If I were him, I'd have taken her home. If you were in my shoes, would you be able to trust the guy? I can never let him have Song-i. It's not up to you to decide that. I know that she's like family to you, but she's not an object. I don't think you're in a position to say who can or can't have her. Well, you have a point. But my point is, I don't like him. I love it here. I feel like I'm inside a painting. Right? I'm sure you've been to better places before. Why are you so moved by everything? It's because I'm with you guys. When I ran away from home, I was really anxious. I felt like I needed to find a great purpose in my life. I was scared that I might be wasting my time. But I'm not anxious anymore. I've decided not to obsess over what is happening at this very moment. Having said that, you shouldn't worry too much just because you can't be sure what's ahead. I'm positive everything will eventually work out well for you. Jeez, that's easy to say. Leave all your worries behind, right here. They say that taking deep breaths helps you calm your mind and body. I want you to copy me. Straighten your shoulders. You sound oddly persuasive. No, not like that. You got it. - Is this correct? - Yes. It was raining cats and dogs, but he didn't even walk her home. If you were in my shoes, would you be able to trust the guy? Hey. Hey. Is that something special? It's called a hip-and-gable roof. It looks like the Chinese character for "eight." It's the oldest traditional private house in Korea, so it's really important in architectural history. Did you have something to say to me? No. Can I help with anything? No, I'm done. - Let's go and meet up with the others. - Okay. - Wow, it's awesome! - It's huge. It's so spacious. Check out the bathroom! - It's so big! - It's so nice! It's unbelievable. Your room is over there, Se-hyeon. Ga-rin, let's check out the second floor. You found an amazing place, Tae-o. And I like how it's in a secluded area. You know you can count on me when it comes to these things. By the way, Se-hyeon will have her own room. It'd be awkward to share one since you just met. You're very meticulous, aren't you? Just don't creep into her room at midnight. Look who's talking. You're the one who liked the idea of your boyfriend having other intentions. I never said that. You said you don't like platonic love. I'm also going to have other intentions. Tae-o's just exaggerating. You know that, right? I'm not into platonic love either. Gosh! When was the last time I slept on a bed? Now I don't have to sleep in someone else's dressing room. This feels like heaven. I'm loving this. This feels great. The bowls are here. We have salt and soy sauce too. All we need to do is go grocery shopping. Would you like to go grocery shopping with Tae-o? I'm a bit tired, so I'm going to lie down. Song-i, did you see our room? I'm going to right now. Is the bathroom over there? Yes, it is. I'm done unpacking. You should unpack too. Okay. FROM SEONG-JIN LET'S GO ON A TRIP TOO. I'll TAKE CARE OF THE PLANE TICKETS AND THE HOTEL. Where are you going? Grocery shopping. - What is it? - I'll come with you. I guess you can help carry the bags. Hey, the water is cool and refreshing. Hey! - Where's Song-i? - Song-i? I think I saw her head out. - She left? - Yes. Hey, I said stop! All right, fine. Check this out. I'm going grocery shopping with Tae-o. You should get some rest. Why would you buy these? Se-hyeon asked for cotton sheets. She said her blanket feels a bit damp. Does she have to be so oversensitive? Can't she bear it for just one night? She's not being oversensitive. It's called being delicate. Unlike someone who blacks out the moment she lies down in her tent. Do you like her that much? Why? Are you jealous? Never mind. What's the point in talking to you? Maybe pink is better. Give me a second. SONGJEONG BEACH I don't think we took this route earlier. I think we took the wrong turn at the crossroads. We should go back. Wait. Can you hear the waves? You're right. Are we close to the sea? Come in. Do you have a hair tie I can borrow? I didn't bring mine. Yes, let me get it for you. I'm pretty sure I had one here. Do you also live in the same neighborhood as us? The same neighborhood? Well, I suppose you could say that. Where do your parents live? At Seongbuk-dong. Yes, I found it! Here you go. You're living apart from your family, then? Yes. I'll put it right here. I'll do it. Yes! This is the charm of going on trips: Unexpected encounters! I agree. This feels great. You like it? - Hey! - Hey! Have you gone nuts? - I'm sorry. Sorry! - Hey! I'm sorry. - Gosh, you... - I won't do it. I won't. I thought you'd want to cool off a bit since it's hot. By the way, what do you think of Se-hyeon? What do you mean? You guys spent an entire day together. She's easygoing and not so fussy, right? If she's not so fussy, why would she ask you to buy her bedsheets? Hey, she only asked at the last minute. She's pretty and smart, but... But? I don't think... she truly appreciates you. Well, she's not exactly the emotional type. I... I have to tell you something. I'm afraid I have to poke my nose into your relationship. Go ahead. I really want you to meet a girl who treasures you. Someone who wants to get to know you and is devoted to you. I know that you're worried about my relationship. That's why you keep doubting and checking to see if he's someone who can be trusted. I feel the same way, too. You're a selfless guy. I don't want to see you get hurt by someone who doesn't deserve you. Why would I get hurt? It's not like Se-hyeon doesn't deserve me. My point is... don't trust her too much. Hold on. You're being jealous, aren't you? Forget it. Just do whatever you want to do. Hey, hey. Keep going. - Move! - That was cute. Do it again. Go away! - Do it again. - Hey! - Everyone! - Hey! - Song-i is being jealous. - Let go! - Okay, okay. - I said move it! Don't come near me! The meat is here! - Yes! - I can't wait. Meat is here! Did you buy a lot? - The meat is here. - Do we have enough? Thanks, buddy. - Take these and get them grilled. - Did you buy the thing I asked for? Here. Keep the beer in the fridge. - Let's have them cold. - Okay. - Do we have enough meat? - Wow, that's a lot. I don't like paprika, though. - Really? - Good, we've got mushrooms. We've got meat, lettuce, and perilla leaves. I'll help. No, I'll do it. You can wait outside. Three, four... Hey. Here you go. It's the best one in town. Thanks. Did you go with Song-i? Yes. Did you get some sleep? No. I had some things to think about. Hey, everyone. Let us all do a grand toast. Raise your glasses. To Song-i who came here to do her field report and our everlasting friendship. Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers! Yes! Try the meat skewer. I'll give you the tastiest one. Have some more. Okay. So, you and Tae-o went to the same elementary school? Yes. But he and I became really close friends after I quit the college-preparatory academy. I used to get kicked out of my home often, so I crashed at his place all the time. Right, Tae-o? So, are you bragging? Is it the production company? PRODUCER KIM Yes. I'm too nervous to pick up the call. You're going to be fine. I'm sure it's not a big deal. - You think so? - Hey, be a man. It might be good news. Okay. I'll man up and take this call. - Give me your moral support. - You can do it. All right, I can do this. I'll be back. You can do it, Hun! - Go, Hun! - Go! Hello? Yes, please go ahead. You want to cancel the contract? Is there no chance of the decision being overturned? I'm sorry, but could you please do me a favor and ask the director to reconsider? The loser cleans all this up. Got it? - Okay. - Okay. Rock, paper, scissors! - You're back. What did they say? - I'll clean it up. I'm going to call it a night. You guys can finish up the food. What should we do? It looks like he got bad news. I'll go and check on him. You guys eat up. Come meet me by the pool. Just what kind of company does something like that? Why did they even cast you if they were going to kick you out? How ridiculous! You know what? They are just like a bunch of delinquent bastards. They won't last long. Just think that you walked out on them. Forget it. I don't want to pretend I'm too good for them. "Meat never betrays you, especially when you're feeling down." Haven't you heard of that before? Let's go and enjoy the food. Tae-o... I'm grateful that you're trying to cheer me up, but I want to be alone right now. What's wrong with him all of a sudden? Recently, he got a part in a musical after passing the audition, but things didn't go so well. He doesn't look like he can act. He should look into a different career. What makes you say that? He has what it takes to be an actor. He's better than anyone I've ever met. You haven't even heard him sing. He's really good at singing. His whole body shakes with passion. I see. He's not just talented but very determined. He even ran away from home to pursue his career. Hun will make it big eventually. He ran away from home? Yes. He was kicked out in his underwear. When I first saw him, I was worried because I thought he was a sexual deviant. But I came to learn that he's a true gem. Out of all of my housemates, he's particularly nice to me and thanks to him, I got to experience a lot of new things. "Out of all of my housemates"? What? No. Well, I... I live with my parents. You said you're living apart from them. Come to think of it, I've been having... a rat infestation at home. So basically... one of you... ran away from home. And you moved out of your parents' place. And the other... Where are you staying now? At a friend's. Song-i, did you receive the file I sent you? Yes, I did. In fact, Tae-o worked on it all night long. You guys... all live together, don't you? I'm okay. Just put it on. Is everything all right? What do you mean? You just seemed a bit upset. What's on your mind? Earlier... when you left with Tae-o... without telling me, I didn't feel good about it. I feel really stupid for being frustrated... because of something like this. When I'm with you... emotions that I've never felt before just keep rushing in. That day we went on a date... I know you went home drenched by the rain. - That was... - I know. I know why you didn't tell me. If you think about it rationally, that's nothing to be mad about. If it were me, I would have done the same. What bothers me isn't the fact that... you didn't tell me about it. The friendship between you and Tae-o bothers me. I hate the fact that you and Tae-o are old friends. I hate it that you live at his place. And I hate having to drop you off at his place. I had no idea. I just... I think those negative feelings will continue to grow, and I'll keep reacting emotionally. I'm not used to feeling those strange emotions. This isn't like me. When I'm with you... my world becomes chaotic. Gosh, where's did she run off to this time? I shouldn't have told you that. I'm too embarrassed to face you now. I don't know about you, but I liked what I heard. "When I'm with you, my world becomes chaotic." I've never had a guy tell me something like that before. I think my life is worth living. My history with Tae-o is something that can't be helped. As you know, you can't change history. True. At least... you are my love story. Is that not enough? Why am I worrying about her when I'm here to have fun? The weather's nice. It is. I've felt this indescribable feeling... once before. Now, I realize... what that feeling was. I don't get to know about everything in Song-i's life anymore. I don't want to have little significance in Song-i's life. What should I do about these feelings... that even I can't explain?
