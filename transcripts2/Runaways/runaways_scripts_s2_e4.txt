 Previously on Marvel's Runaways... This place is paid for by our parents? We can't eat that soup. Nico's right. That's Pride soup. No, no, no! Hey, don't! You guys are into some seriously weird shit. How about a free ticket? I'll even save you a dance. We'll take five tickets, you hateful bitch. Looks like Brandon stole your life. He can have it.

 Keep it off the radar of the cops, the media, and, most importantly, Jonah. I want to hurt him as much as the rest of you do. Not possible. This serum... that Jonah used on Victor. Mm-hm? - It's based on his DNA. Jonah may have just given us the very thing that we need... to kill him. If I'm gonna heal myself, I need another box. You're gonna do one more thing for him. - Yeah? What's that? - Same as you did for his father... Take the rap for his murder charge. Tell me the truth now... Where were you?! Aw, man! She wrecked a pimp's car.

 It was freakin' awesome! Damn. This sure beats staying in a hostel, huh? I'm Topher. Not another step. I got you people tilted, huh? Don't worry, amigos. - I'm not gonna hurt you - ?Qui?n eres t?? Do I know you? No, mu?eca. Not yet. ?C?mo te llamas? Did you follow her home? 'Cause I'll kick your ass right now. - Not quite fast enough, lindo. - Let's ask some questions first. Ah, the leader, eh? I'd shake your hand, but doesn't look like we're there yet. - Who are you? - He's an undercover cop. He's gonna bust us and send us back to our parents who'll murder us, or he's just a cold-blooded killer and he's gonna murder us right here, or he's a blackmailer and he's gonna demand money, which we don't have... We will end up murdered. Everyone take a deep breath, OK? If you saw a little girl pick up a car, you'd check it out, too. Mu?eca is a hero, for real. This guy on the street was messing with this lady, and I tried to talk him out of it... with my fists. I had to protect her. You didn't think to mention this to anyone? I'm mentioning it now. When I heard them talk about the girl with the yellow eyes, I had to check it out. Did I think it would lead me to a... mansi?n arruinada? He means "ruined mansion." It's so poetic. But now that I'm here, you gotta give me the name of your decorator, 'cause this place is dope as shit! Cone of Silence! He can't hear us now. What do we do with him? Discuss. - Let's get rid of him. - I'm with Chase. Isn't he just like us? So what? We find safety, then we just abandon everybody else? - We are Brentwood people. - That's wrong. Let him stay. The cops aren't even looking for us anymore. Who knows if we can trust this kid? Yeah. I mean, look at him. He's all... Homeless? Dirty? Hungry? Uh, hello? Gert, stand up for this guy. In the 100-yard dash between my anxiety and my idealism, I'm ashamed to say my anxiety is winning. I'm a hypocrite. It's official. Don't apologize. Why should we risk letting a stranger in here? You know, my parents invented something for this exact situation. Do you remember the cartridge we found at Graciela's house? Inside is a serum that will wipe your whole hard rive. That 17-page term paper you call your memory? Poof. - Great. Let's do that, then. - No. Let's not. It's from our parents, remember? They're bad people. If we use it, especially on a kid, doesn't that make us just like them? You guys. What the...? No. You guys, he's not going anywhere. So... what is it? - It's a "she." - She's a rescue. - So her breed is unclear. - Pit mix, maybe? So a girl with glowing eyes, a witch with a magic stick, and now a stray pup who had Godzilla for a dad. Feels like I'm in the right place. Yes. See, maybe I had to become a vigilante in order to find someone just like me. To bring in the seventh member of, you know, whatever we are. - OK, Molly. Slow down. - He's a stranger. He's got powers just like me. That can't just be a coincidence. Hey, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's late, and everyone has a lot of questions. - You sleep there. - She sleeps here. Yeah, I'm going to bed. My parents murdered my friend and cost me someone I really cared about, so this guy? Not that important to me. Got room for two? I got no secrets. I think you do. I saw what you did. What I did? And what'd I do? I don't know exactly, but you better believe I'm gonna find out. Oh, shit. I'm sorry. I woke you up. Did I wake you up? Was it the nail biting? I'm sorry. - My worrying woke you up? - It does get a little loud sometimes. I'm sorry. It's the anxiety. It's turning me into a person who says "I'm sorry" all the time. Hey. It's okay. It's not like time even matters anymore. I mean, do you have somewhere you gotta be today? I don't know. Let me check my imaginary smartphone for my imaginary calendar. Nope. Just being a runaway again. Which means you got all day. So... you wanna talk about it? Do you ever think about our old lives? Like where we'd be right now if we weren't here? I try not to think about my current life, never mind my old one. 'Cause I've never thought that I'd want to go to an SAT prep class or AP History. I even miss Eiffel and her patriarchy-supporting dance routines. It is starting to feel like it's all just Tuesday now. No, wait. Wednesday. No, wait, it is Tuesday. Think it's actually Thursday. Whatever. This... is the new normal. The new normal's not all bad. Yeah. It's got an upside, for sure. But it does mean I have a pet dinosaur to go check on, so... Say hey to Molly's new bestie. I'll go back to sleep. Good guard-dino! You keepin' a monocular eye on our mysterious stranger, my little Lacey-wacey? You know when I say "my," I don't mean like I own you, right? 'Cause of course not. You're like... You're like a fully sovereign being. With us, not for us, right, boo? Topher? Guys? Guess we're the first ones here. You want some coffee? Coffee? Cat, did you honestly think you could just act like this didn't happen and I'd go along with it? Well, since there's nothing you can do about it, yeah. What's the point of making it a thing? Because this is a thing. You killin' a man I consider my brother, that's a goddamn thing. It was necessary, Geoffrey. I did it so you didn't have to. And he wasn't your brother. Darius had Alex. He could have shot him, thrown his body off a bridge, but he didn't. He kept our son safe and brought him back to us. Why? Because he was loyal to me. Always. He did it because he wanted money. What you remember about life back in the day is a fantasy. Bein' OG, runnin' a crew... There was a code! A sense of loyalty, a brotherhood. There was a bunch of broke-ass punks slingin' dope, tryin' to knock each other off. Did I not meet you because you killed your boss? Was he your brother, too? - That was different. - It was business. And so was this. We had a plan to free our kids. This was not our plan! Congratulations. Our kids are no longer wanted for murder. We brought scones. This might get loud. Finally, our first solid lead. I tracked the kids using data from Alex's cell phone. Which you got from Alex during your failed mission to extract him, your rogue mission. Turn down the volume on the attitude, Leslie. The information about Alex came to us. Yeah, and you kept it for yourselves. Your word means nothing, Wilders. OK, let's go easy on the big fella, sweetie. But, um, Stacey does have a point. We all agreed, no more secrets. - We all just want our kids back. - And you had them right there. How could you just let them go? You mean how could I stop them? Why don't you ask Tina that? The kids got away because Nico had the Staff. - Jog your memory? - Yes. I gave Nico the Staff. I've already lost one child. I'm sure as hell not gonna lose another. If that meant giving Nico a way to survive on the street... deal with it. You should be thanking us. That Staff is protecting your kids, too. Look, the pressure's off our kids for the moment. We should be focusing on the bigger problem: Jonah. Well, as some of you may recall, Stacey and I have a serum that we think will kill Jonah, but we need to move fast before he figures it out. But we need to do a trial run with the serum first. You only get one shot at a self-healing alien, and it better be good. Yeah. We need to send a drone down into that hole, so that we can biopsy whatever's down there. - Biopsy whatever's... - But we need to access the dig site. - Yeah, I can make that happen. - Good. If the serum works, then soon none of us will need to see each other ever again. Adi?s. Guess that leaves us to search for our kids. Looks like they're centered here. East of La Brea, west of the 5. East of La Brea? What's even over there? Why do I recognize that place? Because it's a Pride soup kitchen. That's no help. They operate anonymously. Everything they do there is confidential. Not if we're the ones asking the questions. Where did you get all this? Hold on. Don't answer that. Maybe I don't wanna know where any of this food came from. ?Mu?eca! This is urban foraging, girl. You think only rich people know about farm-to-table? Here. You gotta try this. Just... - This is so good. - Ahh. I got every orange, aguacate, lemon, and pomegranate tree around here on lockdown. And I know when the good bakeries throw out the day-old stuff. We be feastin', sis. You gotta come through. Oh, my God, is that a banana nut muffin? Ah-ah-ah. We wait for the whole fam. Sharing is caring. - Can I ask you something? - Of course. You're the first person I've met, ever, who's had my eyes. Ever. Same. That's why I had to find you. All this time, I thought it was only me. I felt so... alone. I hear that. How old were you the first time it happened? I was right about your age, I guess. Yeah. - I didn't know what was going on. - Me neither. - It just kinda came out of nowhere. - Right? I was always the outsider, so for me to be that... - Fuerte. - Yes. - I was stoked. - I felt the same. Do you think maybe we're related? I mean, we both speak Spanish, we have the same eyes... Let's see. Es verdad. Nos parecemos. I've never told anyone this, but, um... my parents were scientists, and sometimes I think they did an experiment on me, and that's how I ended up like this. Like a chemistry experiment? - Hey, Molly? - No, they were geologists. They worked with rocks. Does that make any sense to you? Hey. Me and Molly whipped up some chow. So this is why you left? Explains the little remodeling job upstairs. We assumed you were gone for good. And by "assumed," I mean "hoped." You showed me kindness, amigo, and I'm showing it back. Had to get past your "guard dog" first. - What's this? - My guard dog. You people are muy interesante. Is there something going on here that I need to know about? I think you know too much already. Sorry... but he might be my relative. Isn't that nuts? Where did your relative get all this food? - It's called urban foraging. - Is that like artisanal stealing? No, man. Stolen goods? That ain't me. I asked permission first. Go ahead, make yourself a plate. No? Look, I can see you guys aren't... sure about me. You're right. We aren't. So I'm gonna be honest. I know who you are. You been all over the news. Pretty hard to miss, you ask me. You should leave. Oye. C?lmate, hombre. Think about it. You know why you can trust me? Because I don't need you. I've already got this whole street-life thing wired. You guys? You need all the help you can get. We're doing fine, thanks. Are you? You can't even say yes to good food. That kind of pride is just some rookie shit. Us street kids, we stick together. We give and we take... and that's how we survive. I have skills, knowledge you can use... Oh, yeah? Like where to dumpster dive? Damn straight. This ain't Brentwood, you fool. OK, so what's in it for you? ?Claro! I like sleeping indoors... in a bed. Thanks for the offer. We'll think about it. Look, I'm just saying. Rich kid runaways... you gotta be extra careful. You're like housecats out in the wild. I remember this one dude... Good-looking, deluxe family... but when folks on the street found out that there was a reward on him, they didn't hesitate to collect. He just... hadn't built that loyalty out here, you know? Not that I would do that, you know? It's just, not everyone is as trustworthy as me. Enough of all that, please. Who wants quiche? I think this one's gluten-free. I saw him eat one of these. It's not poison. Yes. I knew they'd come around. Come on. Let me give you a tour of your new home. Lead the way, mu?eca. Don't get lost. Or do. You're not hungry either? There's something about that guy that makes me lose my appetite. Maybe you're just jealous... or threatened. What? Why would I be jealous? Because he's handsome, and street-smart, and a really good provider. Chase is handsome. This is so good. We should all feel threatened. He's hiding something. Whatever he's done, it's nothing compared to our parents. Guess someone couldn't sleep last night. You OK? As long as Pride pays for what they've done, I am. - You put your hair back. - I lost my focus. But I'm back now, and we still have an earthquake to stop. Yeah, except now we got a new distraction. Molly thinks he's her long-lost brother. Jules, are you sure that you didn't see these kids at the soup kitchen? She's blonde, tall, really pretty? - Athletic. Played lacrosse. - Top knot, dark lipstick. Angry. I really wish I could tell you more. A lot of kids fit those descriptions. But all of these kids would be together. All six of 'em, in a group. I really do serve hundreds of people every day, so... You're lying. You've seen 'em. If this is your way of keeping them anonymous... Let us reassure you, it's safe to tell us. Especially if you like your job. Yeah, I said it. She's a volunteer, Catherine. I really am sorry I can't help. Tell you what, though, there is a client at the soup kitchen who's very plugged in. He knows everything that happens on the streets. I brought him with me just in case. Would you like to meet with him? Yes! Yeah, I've definitely seen 'em. - Where? - Did they seem healthy? I'd be happy to tell you more, but you know, I was a finance major once upon a time, before I realized the only true freedom in this country is off the grid in the underground economy. And according to my rather conservative asset-pricing model, I'm gonna need fifty bucks first. You tryin' to shake a bitch down over their kids? Here ya go. Fifty dollars. Start talkin'. So, I first saw 'em down at the homeless encampment near the L. A. River. I mean, could you miss them? I'm surprised they survived the night down there. But they are apparently way more craftier than they look, because the next thing I know, they stole my electric baseball gloves. Electric baseball gloves? The Fistigons. Is that what you call 'em? Because those mothers are pretty bad-ass. I was havin' some fun, I was blowing shit up, and then all of a sudden your kids are chasin' after me. And then... What happened? I want to say they had a dinosaur. But I'm gonna chalk that up to a bonkers night of drinkin'. All's I know is, the pretty boy grabbed the gloves, and I haven't seen those kids since. But I will assure you, they ran real fast and looked very healthy. That's all I got. Don't suppose you people care to reimburse me for the baseball gloves? Mike... you might want to keep working on that asset-pricing model of yours, because I would have given you a hundred if you'd asked. Hm. Your call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system. When you are finished recording, you may hang up or press pound for more options. Karolina... I need to... I'd like to, uh, I'd like to see you. There's so many things I need to... There's so many things I want to... I want to tell you. Um, but I'm afraid... I'm afraid there's not too much more time. Karolina? Oh, here you are... hiding from our uninvited guest. I get it. Molly loves him, but I am not feeling it. Well, maybe we should give him a chance. He obviously knows way more about living out here than we do. Hey, are you OK? What's going on? What's that? Someone needs to make money, and I figured since Alex isn't working with Darius anymore, you know, I could get a job. - Doing what? - I was thinking what could I do that wouldn't blow my cover, and I was like, "I know, I'll go down to Hollywood Boulevard disguised as a fairytale princess and see if any tourists want..." Wait. You're gonna take Polaroids with little girls? Thought it was a good idea. I mean, you are basically a real live Disney princess, but Hollywood Boulevard is like, crawling with cops and cameras. Look, we aren't fugitives anymore, and I don't think our parents are gonna be anywhere near Hollywood Boulevard. That's true. We need money... and I want to see what I can do to help. Hm? Fine. But if any dime store SpongeBob gets a little handsy with you, I'm turning his ass into Plankton. - OK. I gotta go. - OK. I'll be careful, I promise. I don't trust him. Well, if we can destroy the dig site, then we can get out of here once and for all, which means Topher isn't a problem anymore. Two birds, one motherboard. By "get out of here" you mean go home? I didn't say that. I mean get out of here. Stop California from crackin' off into the ocean. - And we do that how? - All I know is, it starts with disabling the security at the dig site. - Using these guys? - No. Using this thing. I aced my Ethical Hacking course last semester. If we can mount a directory traversal attack, storm the HTTP and gain access to the restricted directories, we can set the whole thing in self-destruct mode, Stuxnet-style. More like sucks-net. Sorry. It's a good plan, but that was a great joke. Unfortunately, it remains just a plan. One big problem. There is no way that this old computer's gonna be able to take down the security at the site. And that's on top of another big problem... A homeless kid with yellow eyes is squatting in our house. Right. Maybe one big problem can help us solve the other one. All I need is an 18-core, 36-thread processor chip. Oh, good. We have so many of those lying around here in our ruined mansion. I know exactly where to find one. - Where? And how much is it? - It's free. But you are not gonna like what we have to do to get it. We're goin' back to Atlas Academy. - What? - Oh, my God. And what do we do with him? Topher? He's the one that's gonna get us inside. - Um, hi. - Thank you for meeting me. You brought your school books? I had to tell my friends something, so I told them I was job hunting. Oh. You know you're my only priority. Right? Is that enough? No, I can't. That's not why I'm here. No, no, please, just take it all. I said no. You said you had something to tell me and you didn't have much time. Are you sick? I only get one chance to do this right and I don't want to mess it up. Do what? I'm taking a real risk being here, and I want answers. Now. I hear you. And I'm... Don't hear me. Tell me. I can do better than that. Why don't I show you. You don't think we could have parked maybe a little bit closer, Stacey? Hon, it is only 50 yards away. You have lived in California too long. May I remind you that there's an industrial grade razor blade on this drone that could puncture a donut hole in my ribs. Wow, hon, you're so irritable lately. Of course I am! We've spent the last umpteen years of our lives... - Hey, how are you? - We're with Pride. Consorting with morally ruined human beings who won't stop lying to us, and now the only chance of getting our kids back is to stick a drone into a hole of unknown depth, and take a biopsy of whatever's down there so that we can kill someone. - Hey, buddy, how are you? - Leslie cleared us. In this case, I'd say irritation is a context-appropriate emotion. - Breathe. - I'm breathing! - OK. - I'm sorry. - OK. - It's just, I... I'm scared. You know, what if this serum doesn't work? Hey. It's gonna work. How do you know? Because it has to. Where are we going? Are we jogging to Brentwood? - Awesome! - Wait. Three cars? - We don't have the money for this. - You don't need any. I got a gang of free vouchers from a Hollywood Hills party I crashed. Alex, you and Gert get in the first car. Chase, you go with Molly. And Nico, you're with me. Come on. Your girlfriend isn't here anyway. I know you don't like me, but I'm cool with it. It's not that I don't like you. I don't trust you. I see that. You're cold to me. Don't flatter yourself. I'm not warm to anyone. - I like your honesty. - I don't do it for you. - Maybe that's what I like about you. - I don't really care what you like. What do you care about? Wicca? "Do what ye will, and ye harm none." What do you know about Wicca? I know what a spell is. When you take symbols and action, turn them into some... power. Something like that. Seriously, nobody gets that. I do. I think, um... maybe... I misjudged you. Tell me something, though. What's in that vial you carry around? Come on, now. I've seen what you guys can do. Um... are all of you holding? Holding? You mean like with drugs? Oh, I get it. Playing dumb. OK, I got you. You want to keep all your shit to yourself. It's cool. You want me to share with you, don't ya? Because us kids need to stick together. That's right. So we're friends now? OK. We got 15 minutes while everybody's in all-school assembly. I even miss all-school assembly. Once you're inside, straight down the hallway. - Then go up to the second floor. - MOllY: Take the main staircase. - Shouldn't he take the side stairs? - Then he'll run into the Vape Team. - The kids with vape pens. - Oh, they're so annoying. - "Sick clouds, brah." - You guys, stop. First door to your right is the computer lab. Back of the room there's a wood cabinet. Inside is a safe. 19-3-26, right, left... Give me your phone, I'll write it down. Do not speak to anyone. Not that anyone here has anything to say. - It's not that bad, Nico. - It's not that good, either. Got it? I survived foster care, no? I think I can handle a bunch of fresas. Fresas. It means spoiled rich kids. - Like us? - Like we used to be. OK, it's almost here. Got the serum? Release the biopsy from the cylinder... inject it with the serum, and... We can finally move on with our lives. If it works. Careful. Eww. What is that smell? It's malodorous, yet not completely unfamiliar. A very mature Stilton? Maybe something from the Limburger family? Ugh. The body wall looks tessellated. Calcite microcrystals, maybe? Definitely organic. That smell is the very essence of decay. Which means whatever the serum does to this thing, it'll also do to Jonah. Well... here goes. It's turning black! Necrosis! Yes! - Sweetie! - Oh, it's great! Hold on a second. It's an earthquake! - Another earthquake?! - Is this it? Is this the one? - I've got you. Stay calm. - Nobody move. Topher's stuck in there! OK, that... wasn't too bad. - You OK? - Not even in theory. - I loved it. - Okay, that alarm means we got about two seconds before earthquake protocol kicks in. All students proceed to the parking lot... - There's Topher! - For a mandatory head count. - We gotta get that computer. - We gotta get Topher! OK, come on, you guys, we're going in. Keep your heads down, we'll disappear into the chaos. Chase and I will head to the lab. Molly, we'll go to the parking lot. And Gert... Gert? - Gertrude Yorkes? - Oh, my God! Sorry! Wow! You really startled me. Whoa. Hang on a second. Is this your first day back? Yes. Yes! And that earthquake... really got me shook. Sorry about the pun. It just really shows how emotionally fragile I am. Which is why I actually came to see if you have any of my anxiety meds here? There... There should be a big bottle of them with my name on it... somewhere back there. Usually I'm notified when kids who've been through something traumatic return to school. You... Oh, you mean the fugitive thing? Hmm. Um, that probably sounded a lot worse than it actually was. We were never actually suspected of murder. You know, fake news. Can you check on my medicine, though? Just a moment. Hi, it's Nurse Wilson, I've got Gertrude Yorkes here. They're reporting the earthquake as a 5.1. It's big, but not the Big One. It's another one. That's all I need to know. We're running out of time. Is the epicenter near the dig site? South of downtown. Someone's seen the kids. Look where it's coming from. It's locked. There's no other way in. I knew I should have brought the Fistigons. We agreed everybody's going civilian for this one. Okay? Even Nico. It's Atlas Academy, remember? Wait, I know someone with a master key. They stole it freshman year and have had it ever since. But everybody's out in the parking lot. Eh... not this person. And I know right where to find 'em. Come on. No way am I doing in here without consent. It's gender neutral now, thanks to Gert's petition. Sorry. I love Gert, but only girls use this bathroom. Just guard the door. I'm goin' in. Hey. Are you serious? I thought you were, like, a fugitive from justice. - Not anymore. - It's too bad. Outlaw was a good look on you. Why are you back here, anyway? This place is so boring. I have a new appreciation for Atlas Academy. And boring. Hm. What do you think about hashtag EarthquakeBitches? Is that too much? I think you're gonna throw massive "likes" up on the scoreboard. I think so too! Um, hey... I need a favor. Aiding and abetting a former murder suspect? Sure. But I'll need something in return, obvi. Name it. Oh, my God, there you are. Where have you been? I tried to score some meds out of the nurse's office. Nurse Nightmare? Why would you risk that? - Did anyone see you? - Uh... no. No! I don't know. Possibly. You never really know. We should probably hurry, though. What are you doing outside of the gender neutral bathroom? Waiting for Chase. He's in there getting a key to the computer lab. He should be out any second. Can I just quickly note how weird it is that I just used to walk up and down there halls taking central heat and air conditioning for granted? Dude, hurry! - I'm gonna go in. - No, no, you might not want to do that. Bye, Chase! Hi, Alvin. Other person. Come on, let's go. Come on. The earthquake knocked out the lights. Traffic's all backed up. - What's up? - Move it! Let's give it a try! We can walk from here. Where are we going? Look, the earthquake, it didn't come out of nowhere. Something's happened. We need to get there. Please. I'm scared. Karolina... you don't have to come with me. But there is a trade-off. What I am... is what you are. Without me, you... you'll never know your whole self. Who you really are. It's your choice. They're gonna catch him. Topher! We'll never get to him without being seen. We can't just sit here and do nothing. I'm gonna go get him. Wait, wait. Molly. Our parents. What are they doing here? We gotta get out of here. All right, let's go. Our parents are here! They just rolled into the parking lot in their motorcade of evil. This'll take one second. Hold on. - Too late. - They're in the building. - Run! Run! - Shit. Wait, Molly. Over here. The secret stairs. - It's locked. - Alex. I got it. The earthquake happened right when we injected the serum. Do you think there's any connection between the two? I do. Oy! They saw us. Do you think they saw us? They definitely saw us. They're looking right at us. We gotta go! That was Gert and Molly's parents. What are they doing here? We should check and see if Karolina's OK. And she probably knows how Gert and Molly are doing. That is not a chance we can take. Slow down, this is not safe! I think we just found out the cause of this earthquake. - What if they tell my mom? - Your mother can't hurt you. Nobody can. I protect you from now on. Come on. Ay, dios. Where were you, fam? Mission accomplished. I thought we weren't supposed to say that anymore. How did you get this? I walked into the computer lab. Dialed 19-26-3. And here you go. You're welcome. That's amazing. You rock, cuz. - Nice work, man. - Not bad. Chase, you coming? The best thing was when we finally get over the wall, and there you were, holding the computer. It was all Alex. I was just following his directions. Sorry I gave you such a hard time. - You totally came through. - It's OK, I know how it is. Who can you trust, right? - How's the hotspot working? - Game-changer. I've already started flooding the security at the dig site with multiple spoofed addresses. Keep the phone. I can get another one. No problema. Consider it rent. Thank you. Seriously, we couldn't have done this without you. - I told you. - That's how we roll, right, hermanita? S?, hermano. Do you think we can go back to Atlas Academy and maybe this time we break into the nurse's office? Hey, one thing I'm still wondering about. How come your eyes turned yellow? I think it maybe runs in my family. I don't know. Can I talk to you? Alone? Is this what you were looking for? So that's why you were so friendly in the car. - I'm just playing. - I'm not. This is why your eyes turn yellow, isn't it? Is that mine, or are you finally ready to share? I'm finally ready for the truth. You're nothing like Molly. You get high off this stuff, don't you? So what is this? And where the hell did you get it? Here we are. This is what you wanted to show me? As you know, I've been here before. I want to thank you, Karolina. You are truly everything I could ever dream of in a daughter. This day has been an honor. You are exactly who you need to be for where we're going. Where are we going? I told you I'd show you everything, and now I will. Trust me. I don't know if I can trust you. I'm going to trust myself.
