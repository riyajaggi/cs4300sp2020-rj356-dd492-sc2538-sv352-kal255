 50 years have passed. But I do not age. Time has lost its effect on me. Yet the suffering continues. Aku's grasp chokes the past, present, and future. Hope is lost. Got to get back, back to the past, Samurai Jack. Are you sure she was the one? Yes. I specifically saw her asking about him.

 Aku's bounty hunter? I sense her evil. Gotcha! We will not let you hurt the samurai. Hurt? No, I... Look, I'm not trying to hurt him. I'm trying to find him. He might be in trouble. You are his friend? I... don't know. We are his friends. It was long ago. We were slaves.

 Down, down, you miserable beast! Now go! Come on! You're not moving fast enough. But then Jack came. He risked his life to save ours. Miss, the bearded fella you inquired about, he got off here. Thank you for sharing your story. You're supposed to get off when you land! I'm alive! ♪ Doo do do do! ♪ I'm alive ♪ I'm alive ♪ Oh, right! That samurai schmuck broke my phone. I got to tell Aku that Jacky boy lost his sword. Oh, well, I guess I'm bunny hopping my way there. Hippity hop, baby! If you are one of Aku's minions, we suggest you run. If you are another, then reveal yourself. I seek the samurai. No, I seek to help him. He might be in danger. A friend of Samurai Jack is a friend of ours. Come. Welcome to our home. None of this would exist if it wasn't for him. We were cursed, bound to guard a magical portal. The samurai was able to defeat us, but instead of using it to fulfill his quest... he freed us. An act of unmeasurable sacrifice. Later, we learned the curse was of Aku's doing. Have you seen him? Has he passed through here? No. Since that day, we have not seen him. But we now stand against Aku. If he is ever in need, we will be there. Thank you. I have to go. Oh, man. Oh. All this walking is hard on my neck. Hey, I made it! I finally made it! What is the problemo, babe? "No shirt, no shoes, no body, no entry!"? Swing-a-ding-ding! I am Aku's top bot, the assassin with the sassin'. "Aku's current top assassins: "one, Deathblow, two, Da-Bomb, three, Scaramouche." Oh, baby, I have come down in the world. How do you like that? One day, you're the star of the show, the next, you're the third act of a two-act play. Well, this star is a headliner, babe, and once I tell Aku Jacky-o lost his sword-o, I'll be numero uno once more-o. Hmm, now how am I gonna get aboard the... Oh, bing-o, baby! Oh, drat! ♪ Bow wow wow ♪ Bow wow wow ♪ Bow wow wow, babe ♪ Bow wow heart-breaker. Yeah, babe. Dig this groovy cat. Chow, chow, chowdity-chow chow, baby cakes! Whoo-hoo! Numero uno, here I come! That's 50 credits, bud. Trust me, babe, I'm good for it. Yeah, well the last guy I trusted did this to me! Oh, it's all good, Babou. Aku will give me anything once he hears the news. ♪ Doo doo doo doo ♪ Doo doo doo doo ♪ Doo doo doo doo Whoa, what a freak. Looked like a talking penis. Have you seen a samurai come through here? What do you want with the samurai? I think he's in danger. He needs my help. Samurai drop! ♪ We will never forget you Till the day we die ♪ Samurai ♪ Sa-sa-samurai ♪ Aku enslaved the children ♪ With his beasts from hell ♪ But then he came and fought The evil away ♪ It was the samurai ♪ The samurai ♪ We will never forget you Till the day we die ♪ Samurai ♪ Sa-sa-samurai ♪ Samurai-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i Thank you. I will find him. I must find him. Aku, our lord and master, is one with the darkness. He was born from it. It fills him with infinite power. We, too, must become one with it. We are forever grateful and ever in your service. Uh-oh. Hey, babe, be a doll and fetch us a drinky-poo. Screw off, jerk-head! I don't work here! Oh, touchy. A phone! Scaramouche, you are one lucky devil. This is the operator. Can I help you? Yeah, emergency collect call to Aku, babe. Please say your name. Scaramouche. Please hold. Hello? Collect call from... Scaramouche. ...will you accept the charges? Oh, uh... Eh... - I guess. - Thank you. Aku, my boss-man, you will not believe what I just went through, babe. What? It's hard to hear you! Eh, hold on a sec. Hey, fellas, could you keep it, like, down? I'm trying to have a conversation. You talking to us? Yeah, that's right, Rover. I want you to keep your barking to a minimum. Rover? Barking? I think he's calling us dogs. Okay, little puppy, you looked in a mirror lately? Now, go get somebody their slippers or something. I'm on the line. So I wanted to tell ya, Aku, Jacko has lost-- Huh? What? Forget it! Usually me and the boys would rip your head from your body, but looks like somebody already did us the favor, eh? So in lieu of that... Dippity doo dang, babe. Hey, man, close the damn door! You're letting all the heat out! What you want here, Leaf Girl? I'm looking for Samurai Jack. Huh, what'd you say? I'm looking for Samurai Jack. Huh? What's that? Damn it, girl, speak up! I'm looking for Samurai Jack! You're looking for the samurai? Little girl, Samurai Jack is the toughest S.O.B. out there. Last time we fought, he did... this to me. That's nothing! Check me out! These things are literally holding me together! Dude, really? I used to go to the bathroom, but now I go in a bag! He busted me eye! Man, those robotic cats got nothin' on me! 'Cause back in the day, I was a bad-ass sa-mu-rai! I was da' samurai! I was all about the slicing and dicing! Talkin' 'bout the... funk-a-chop... the whack-a-hack, and, of course, the ever famous... turkey carve! But Samurai Jack enlightened me to the true meaning of being a samurai. Shortly after, I gave up my blade and top knot and became the bartender here at the place where we first met. Uh... That doesn't sound bad at all. That's because you ain't got no soul, you robot fool! I have returned! I, Demongo, have come to collect the souls of the greatest warriors. But I see I have come to the wrong place. We got some straight-up freaks coming through this place. Are you the one looking for the samurai? Yes. Are you his friend? Yes. Follow the path north. Who? Samurai Jack? You may witness, but you cannot proceed any further. Witness what? The end. Great warriors of past, I welcome you. This samurai has failed his purpose and has accepted his fate. Stop! This does not concern you. There is no hope. No! Hope lives. It is everywhere. I've seen it, everyone you have touched, the people you have helped. You saved them! Enough! Hope is just a fleeting sentiment. Your failure is real. You must face the consequences or continue to bear the guilt of your dishonor for all eternity. Jack, don't listen! You're being misguided! I've seen it. You've saved countless innocents. And most of all... ...you showed me the truth! You made me see that there's so much more to me than I knew existed. You made me way more than what I was. The hope you gave me saved my life! Death follows in your wake, men, women, children. Yes. All those children dead because of you. No! The children, they're alive! You saved them! No more words! I, uh... I like your hair. And dress. What now? It's time to find my sword. ♪ Watch out ♪ Got to get back ♪ Back to the past ♪ Samurai Jack ♪ Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack ♪ Watch out ♪ ♪ Got to get back ♪ Back to the past ♪ Samurai Jack ♪ Watch out ♪ Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack ♪ Watch out ♪ Got to get back ♪ Samurai Jack Jack, Jack, Jack ♪ Watch out ♪
