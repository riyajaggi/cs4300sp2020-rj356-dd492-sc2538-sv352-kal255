 WHEN A BROTHER'S BY HIMSELF. Dalen: YOU ALL RIGHT? JUST WIRES AND COBWEBS, HOMIE. OUR MISSION IS TO HIT THE MOST HAUNTED LOCATIONS IN AMERICA TO PROVE THAT GHOSTS ARE FOR REAL. JUWAN! YOU ARE NOT WELCOMED ON THIS PROPERTY. WE ARE... Together: THE GHOST BROTHERS. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS YO, YO, YO. FELLAS, WHAT'S GOIN' ON, MAN? OH, WHAT'S UP, BOSS? GOOD. PSH. WHAT'S UP, BROTHER? - GOOD. - CHILLIN', MAN? I DIDN'T COME IN HERE FOR A CUT TODAY. I CAME BRINGING NEWS YOU CAN USE. I FOUND THIS DOPE SPOT IN MONTICELLO, ARKANSAS. THE ALLEN HOUSE WAS A FAMILY MANSION BUILT IN 1906 BY A WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN, JOE LEE ALLEN. BUT TRAGEDY STRUCK THE FAMILY IN 1948 WHEN JOE'S MIDDLE DAUGHTER, LaDELL, TOOK A LETHAL DOSE OF POISON ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT. OH, WORD. PEOPLE DO BELIEVE THAT SHE DID KILL HERSELF OVER A MARRIED DUDE SHE WAS TALKING TO. - LOVER'S QUARREL. - SHE WAS A SIDE CHICK. - SHE WAS A SIDE CHICK? - NOT ANOTHER SIDE CHICK. SO WE GOT A SIDE GHOST THAT WE'RE ABOUT TO INVESTIGATE? ESSENTIALLY. BUT HERE'S WHERE IT GETS EVEN WEIRDER THE NEW FAMILY THAT LIVES IN THIS HOUSE, REBECCA AND MARK SPENCER, RIGHT, THEY HAVE CLAIMS OF SEEING DOPPELGANGERS. DOPPELGANGER, BRO, IS AN EXTREMELY RARE TYPE OF SPIRIT. IT'S ESSENTIALLY A GHOSTLIKE VERSION OF YOURSELF. IN OLD FOLKLORE, SOME SAY DOPPELGANGER SPIRITS ARE BAD OMENS AND MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO CARRY OUT A MESSAGE. OTHERS SAY DOPPELGANGERS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO SHOW UP AFTER TRAGIC EVENTS. IF YOU EVER LOOK YOUR DOPPELGANGER IN THE FACE, LIKE, THEY SAY YOU AUTOMATICALLY JUST DIE. MARK AND REBECCA BOTH HAVE CLAIMS OF SEEING SPIRITS OF THEMSELVES IN ALMOST EVERY ROOM OF THE HOUSE. REBECCA'S EVEN SEEN HER OWN SPIRIT CLOSING THE KITCHEN CABINETS. WE GOT TO GIVE MARK A CALL AND SEE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON. WE HEARD THAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY SEEN DOPPELGANGERS IN YOUR HOME. CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US MORE ABOUT THAT? THAT'S CRAZY. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO ALLOW US TO COME OUT TO YOUR HOME AND SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND OUT THERE? ALL RIGHT, MARK. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT, MAN. DUDE, MAN, WE NEED TO REALLY FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE, MAN, EITHER WHO OR WHAT IS HAUNTING THIS PLACE. - WELL, LET'S GO, MAN. - I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO GO NOW. I'M GONNA FINISH HIM UP, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA JUMP ON THE PLANE AND WE OUT. - LET'S GO. - MEET Y'ALL THERE. LIKE THE HAIRCUT, BRO. ALL RIGHT, BOSS. Dalen: TIME TO START GHOSTING. SO WE'RE IN MONTICELLO, ARKANSAS, MAN, HEADED TO THE ALLEN HOUSE. THIS IS WHERE REBECCA SAYS SHE HAD CLAIMS OF DOPPELGANGERS. OH, OKAY, GOT YOU. YOU GUYS DO REMEMBER WHAT DOPPELGANGERS ARE, RIGHT? DOPPELGANGERS? THEY'RE ALMOST LIKE A DOUBLE OF YOU, BUT IT'S LIKE AN EVIL VERSION OF YOURSELF. - EXACTLY. - OH, OKAY. SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU AS A THUG AS A GHOST. - RIGHT. - SO A GHOST THUG. GHOST THUGGIN'. SO, LIKE, MY GHOST THUG WOULD HAVE A TATTOO ON HIS FACE? POTENTIALLY. SO WHAT WOULD MY DOPPELGANGER'S NAME BE? SINCE I'M MARCUS, IT WOULD BE LIKE... DARKCUS? WHAT? WAIT, THAT JUST SEEMED LIKE THAT WAS A PERSONAL SHOT. THAT WAS A PERSONAL SHOT? THAT WAS A PERSONAL SHOT AS IF YOU'RE LIGHTER THAN ME. AND YOU'RE JUST WEARING A PINK SHIRT TODAY. THAT'S ALL IT IS. LET ME ASK Y'ALL THIS. SO WE'RE GONNA GO TO A HOUSE THAT IS HAUNTED BY A SIDE CHICK? YEAH. MARCUS, DUDE, YOU'RE THE ONLY MARRIED PERSON IN THE CLIQUE. WE GOT TO USE YOU AS A TRIGGER, HOMIE. LIKE, WHAT IF SHE WANTS TO, LIKE, DIP OFF WITH YOU? WHAT IF SHE HAS A THING FOR MARRIED MEN? I KNOW IT'S NOT IN MY CONTRACT TO HAVE NO SIDE GHOST. - BRO. - MY WIFE WILL KILL ME! "YOU NOT GONNA GET MY MAN!" "WHO IS THIS BITCH?" "WHO IS THIS GHOST BITCH? OH, YOU WANT TO BE WITH HER, FOR REAL?" SO IT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT OVER HERE, MAN. - UH, RIGHT HERE. - DIFFERENT HISTORY INTO THE TOWN. WORD. THAT'S IT? YEAH. Juwan: [ WHISTLES ] HAS A SPOOKINESS ABOUT IT. THAT'S A NICE HOME. STILL SCARY, THOUGH. Dalen: WE'RE GONNA GO INSIDE AND MEET UP WITH MARK AND HIS FAMILY AND LEARN MORE ABOUT THESE WHOLE DOPPELGANGER EXPERIENCES. WHAT IF YOU LOOKED IN THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW AND SAW YOURSELF LOOKING BACK AT YOU? I WOULDN'T BE LOOKING HIM IN THE FACE. OH, SO YOU AIN'T GONNA BE A MAN AND LOOK YOURSELF IN THE FACE? - HECK NO! - YOU WOULD DIE! I REALLY BELIEVE THAT ANY TIME WE DO ANYTHING BAD, THAT'S JUST OUR DOPPELGANGER. I'M GONNA BLAME IT ON THE DOPPELGANGER, NOT THE ALCOHOL, THE DOPPELGANGER. [ KNOCKING ON DOOR ] - HEY, HELLO. - COME ON IN. - HI. I'M MARK SPENCER. - MARCUS. HOW YOU DOING? I'M DALEN. AND YOU ARE? REBECCA. IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE. I'M JUWAN. - GOOD TO MEET YOU. - DEFINITELY A PLEASURE. WE APPRECIATE YOU GUYS ALLOWING US - INTO YOUR BEAUTIFUL HOME. - OH, THANK YOU. WHEN WE FIRST MOVED TO MONTICELLO 10 YEARS AGO, AND WE TOLD PEOPLE WE WERE INTERESTED IN BUYING THIS HOUSE, EVERYBODY TOLD US NOT TO BUY THE HOUSE. AND WHEN WE ASKED THEM, "WHY NOT?" THEY ALL SAID, "BECAUSE IT'S HAUNTED." - WOW. - THERE WAS A HISTORY THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE IDEA THAT IT WOULD BE HAUNTED. CHRISTMAS NIGHT, 1948, THE MIDDLE DAUGHTER, LaDELL, ATTENDED HER MOTHER'S ANNUAL CHRISTMAS PARTY HERE AT THE HOUSE. LATE IN THE EVENING, SHE PREPARED HERSELF A GLASS OF PUNCH AND A PLATE OF HORS D'OEUVRES. AND SHE WENT UP TO THE MASTER BEDROOM SUITE. AND SHE USED THE PUNCH AND THE HORS D'OEUVRES TO MASK THE TASTE OF MERCURY CYANIDE. - OH, MAN. - OH. Juwan: SO IS THERE A REASON AS TO WHY SHE MAY HAVE COMMITTED SUICIDE? THE MYSTERY WAS SOLVED IN AUGUST OF 2009. I WOKE UP, AND I IMMEDIATELY FELT THE COMPULSION TO GO TO THE ATTIC. Dalen: REALLY? MARK SAYS HE DISCOVERED ABOUT 90 LETTERS THAT LaDELL HID UNDER THE ATTIC FLOORBOARDS. THE STORY FROM THE LETTERS IS THAT LaDELL'S LOVER, PRENTISS, MADE PROMISES TO LEAVE HIS WIFE IN THE SUMMER OF 1948. Mark: THEY TALKED A LOT ABOUT BEING TOGETHER BY THE HOLIDAYS. THEY WERE GOING TO SPEND CHRISTMAS TOGETHER... - OH. - ...HERE IN MONTICELLO. THEN, IN EARLY DECEMBER, HE WROTE HER A LETTER TELLING HER THAT HE DIDN'T THINK HE WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE HIS WIFE AFTER ALL. - MAN! - AND THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. WHAT WAS THE DEFINING MOMENT FOR BOTH YOU GUYS, WHEN YOU WAS LIKE, "OKAY, FOR SURE, THERE'S SOMETHING IN THIS HOUSE"? WHEN WE FIRST MOVED INTO THE HOUSE, THAT'S WHEN I WENT IN THE KITCHEN AND SAW THE DOPPELGANGER OF MYSELF. SHE WAS STANDING IN THE KITCHEN, KIND OF MY HEIGHT, SAME HAIR, BODY BUILD, AND EVERYTHING FROM BEHIND, KIND OF RIFLING THROUGH THE SPICE CABINET. AND AS SOON AS I SAW HER, I LOST MY BREATH. I COULDN'T BREATHE. AND I FELL TO THE FLOOR. AND THEN I WAS ABLE TO LOOK AWAY. AND WHEN I LOOKED AWAY, THEN IT WAS GONE. Juwan: REALLY? I'LL TELL YOU, MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WAS THE DAY WE WERE MOVING IN. AND I SAW OUR SON, JACOB, STANDING BY THE SIDE STAIRCASE. AND HE WAS JUST STANDING THERE VERY STILL. AND I SAID TO HIM, "WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR NEW HOUSE?" AND HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. AND I TURNED. AND I SAID AGAIN, "WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR NEW HOUSE, JACOB?" AND HE STILL DIDN'T ANSWER ME. AND WHEN I TURNED BACK, HE WASN'T THERE. WOW. JACOB'S HAD A FEW EXPERIENCES OF HIS OWN. AND YOU CAN TALK WITH HIM, IF YOU WANT. - WE COULD TALK WITH HIM? - SURE. ASIDE FROM THE DOPPELGANGERS, HAS THERE BEEN ANY OTHER CLAIMS, LIKE, YOU KNOW, IN THE HOUSE? I'VE SEEN THINGS, I'VE SMELLED THINGS, HEARD THINGS. YOU MIGHT BE IN THE KITCHEN, AND THE CABINET WILL OPEN, AND IT WILL CLOSE, AND IT WILL OPEN, AND IT WILL CLOSE AND DO IT SEVERAL TIMES. THE DINING ROOM IS ONE OF THE BIG HOT SPOTS IN THE HOUSE. AND WE REALLY THINK THAT'S BECAUSE THE FAMILY HELD FUNERALS HERE. AND THE BODIES WERE ALWAYS BROUGHT IN AND LAID OUT IN THE DINING ROOM. HOW MANY FUNERALS WOULD YOU SAY... - AT LEAST FIVE. - AT LEAST FIVE. THAT'S CRAZY. REBECCA BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE DEFINITELY SPIRITS IN THE DINING ROOM. SHE CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN A SHADOW MAN WEARING A WIDE-BRIMMED HAT. AND SHE'S EVEN SMELLED CIGAR SMOKE. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE ABOUT THE HOUSE IF YOU GUYS WOULDN'T MIND SHOWING US MORE. NO, NO, IT'D BE OUR PLEASURE. THIS WAS LaDELL'S BEDROOM. AND THIS IS A HOT SPOT IN THE HOUSE FOR PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. I WAS COMING INTO THE ROOM, AND I SAW REBECCA, OR WHAT I THOUGHT WAS REBECCA, STANDING AT THAT WINDOW. SHE HAD HER BACK TO ME. AND I GET ABOUT 3 FEET FROM HER. AND SHE VANISHED. Juwan: WHOA. RIGHT BEFORE YOUR EYES? - GONE. - THAT'S CRAZY. THE CLAIMS WE'VE HEARD SO FAR FROM MARK AND REBECCA HAVE BEEN CRAZY. BUT I WANT TO TALK TO THEIR SON, JACOB, AND SEE WHAT HE'S EXPERIENCED. A FEW YEARS AGO, I HEARD JOSHUA, MY OLDER BROTHER, START SAYING MY NAME. IT WAS A VERY CLEAR, VERY LOUD VOICE, ALMOST LIKE HE WAS STANDING NEXT TO ME, NOT JUST LIKE I COULD HEAR HIM THROUGH THE DOOR. AND SO, YOU KNOW, I -- I ASKED HIM, "WHAT DO YOU NEED?" BUT HE NEVER ANSWERED. HE JUST KEPT SAYING, "JACOB, JACOB, JACOB," OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IT STARTED FREAKIN' ME OUT. - RIGHT, RIGHT. - SO I WENT TO GO AND TELL MOM. AND I FOUND THAT JOSHUA WAS DOWNSTAIRS. WELL, HOW'D YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT, WHEN YOU SAW YOUR BROTHER DOWNSTAIRS? IT FREAKED ME OUT A GOOD BIT. WORD. I'VE HEARD ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME SERIOUS PARANORMAL STUFF GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE. AND IT'S TIME TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. WHAT'S OUR GAME PLAN FOR TONIGHT? WE GOT A LOT OF SPIRITS IN THIS HOUSE, MAN. YOU GOT APPARITIONS OF KIDS. YOU GOT DOPPELGANGERS. LIKE, I'M TALKING ABOUT A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT CLAIMS GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE. HOW ARE WE GONNA GET IN TOUCH WITH THESE FOLKS, MAN? BAIT. ANY TIME YOU'RE TRYIN' TO GET SOMEBODY, YOU GOT TO GIVE THEM THAT BAIT. - I LIKE WHERE YOUR HEAD IS. - WELL, WHAT'S THE BAIT? - A CASKET. - SHUT YOUR MOUTH. IF WE PUT A CASKET IN IT, THAT GONNA BE THE BIGGEST BAIT THAT YOU CAN GET. I'M WITH YOU, BROTHER. LET'S GET THAT. Dalen: OUR MISSION TONIGHT IS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT LaDELL'S STORY AND TO SEE IF SHE'S WHAT'S CAUSING THESE DOPPELGANGERS. IT SOUNDS LIKE, MAN, I GUESS THE ONLY THING WE HAVE LEFT TO DO IS WAIT ON NIGHTFALL. IT'S TIME TO POP THE TRUCK ON THESE GHOSTS! - YEAH. - UH-OH. BOY! LET'S GET TO IT. THERE IT IS. LISTEN, THIS IS WHAT WE GOT FOR TODAY. OUR EVP RECORDERS, ALL RIGHT. OKAY, ALL RIGHT. - JUST TO CATCH ANYTHING. - OKAY. THEN WE ALSO HAVE OUR DIGITAL CAMERA. I GOT YOU. - WITH AN INFRARED LIGHT ON IT. - THE I.R. - WHAT ELSE WE GOT? - OH-HO, THE REM-PODS. COOL. THAT'S ME WITH IT. TAKE IT, BROTHER. ALL RIGHT. Dalen: SO WE'RE HEADED INTO THE ALLEN HOUSE, MAN, TO FINALLY GET THIS INVESTIGATION STARTED. ALMOST ALL OF THE SIGHTINGS CENTER AROUND LaDELL'S STORY. SO JUWAN AND I ARE GOING STRAIGHT TO THE SOURCE OF THE ACTIVITY -- THE ATTIC. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDIN' ME. BRO, JUST GO. YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. BRO, I GOT YOUR BACK. GO, BIG. I CAN SEE ON THE CAMERA. I CAN'T SEE GOING UP, MAN! NO. GO, BRO. I GOT YOU. WHOA, WHAT THE **** IS THAT? I DON'T KNOW, MAN. DO YOU SEE THAT AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS? LOOK, DUDE. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? GO UP THERE, BRO. - AW, HELL NO. - BRO, GO UP THERE! GO AHEAD. YOU LEAD THE WAY 'CAUSE YOU GOT THE LIGHT. - BRO, ARE YOU BEHIND ME? - I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU. HEY, MAN, I'M NOT TRYING TO BE ANY TYPE OF FUNNY, BUT PUT YOUR HAND ON MY SHOULDER, BRO. I GOT YOU, MAN. WE'RE WALKING UP THE STAIRS, ENTERING THE ATTIC. Shh. HOLD ON, BRO. Shh. SO -- - DO YOU HEAR THAT? - Shh. BRO, I CAN'T SEE **** OTHER THAN THROUGH THIS INFRARED LIGHT, BRO. THIS IS BY FAR THE CREEPIEST ****. - YOU CAN'T SEE ****. - OH! Juwan: WHAT? WHAT? QUIT PLAYIN', MAN! GO UP THERE, BRO. GO UP THERE! AW, HELL NO. GO AHEAD. YOU LEAD THE WAY 'CAUSE YOU GOT THE LIGHT. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S HAUNTING THE ALLEN HOUSE, SO WE'RE GOING UP TO THE ATTIC, WHERE THE SPIRIT OF LaDELL HAS BEEN SEEN SEVERAL TIMES. - BRO, ARE YOU BEHIND ME? - I GOT YOU, MAN. Dalen: HOLD ON, BRO. Juwan: Shh. BRO, I CAN'T SEE **** OTHER THAN THROUGH THIS INFRARED LIGHT, BRO. THIS IS BY FAR THE CREEPIEST ****. CAN'T SEE ****. Juwan: WHAT? WHAT? QUIT PLAYIN', MAN! WHAT, MAN? BRO, I PUT MY HAND ON THE BANISTER, AND I TOUCHED SOMETHING, BRO. MY BAD. IT'S A TRASH BAG, HOMIE. WELL, LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT HOW YOU JUST HAD ME IN THE FETAL POSITION. IT WAS A TRASH BAG, BRO. IT WAS A TRASH BAG, HOMIE. AFTER THAT, WE WERE SO FREAKED OUT ABOUT THE ATTIC. WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LITTLE BREAK AND GO BACK UP LATER. HEY, MARCUS? THAT ATTIC AIN'T NOTHIN' TO MESS WITH. MARK SENT US COPIES OF THE LETTERS HE FOUND IN THE ATTIC FROM LaDELL'S LOVER. SO WE'RE GONNA READ THEM OUT LOUD AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT MORE ABOUT HER STORY. "TO LaDELL, SEPTEMBER 1948. MY DARLING, I WAS SO HUNGRY FOR YOUR WORD FROM YOU. I WAS LIKE A DOG WITH TWO BONES." TWO BONES! "I JUST LOVE YOU SO MUCH, AND I WISH I WERE WITH YOU RIGHT THIS MINUTE." AND HE WAS SMOOTH WITH HER IN THE BEGINNING. "MISS ALLEN, I THINK WE CAN TALK OVER AND MAKE PLANS FOR OUR FUTURE. THE PRICE WILL BE HIGH, NO DOUBT, BUT THAT SHOULD BE IMMATERIAL AS COMPARED TO ONE'S HAPPINESS." HE'S REALLY LEADING HER ON RIGHT NOW. Dalen: WHEN READING THESE LETTERS, IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THAT PRENTISS WAS MAKING SOME EMPTY PROMISES ABOUT LEAVING HIS WIFE. "I HAD SOME PICTURES TAKEN A FEW WEEKS AGO, AND I FOUND THIS ONE IN MY DESK. IF YOU WANT IT, KEEP IT. SEND ME ONE OF YOU, DARLING. I REALLY WOULD LOVE IT." THAT'S FUNNY. - YEAH. - 'CAUSE YOU ASKING FOR PICS. YEAH. BUT HE SENT ONE FIRST. DO YOU FEEL LIKE IT COULD HAVE BEEN A D-PIC? NO, YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS? IT WAS, LIKE, UH, THEM OLD-SCHOOL UNDERWEAR PICS. HE GOT ON THEM WHITE DRAWERS. WITH THE BACK OUT? YEAH, HE GOT ON THEM WHITE DRAWERS OR THE WHITE JOCKSTRAP. BRO, DO YOU KNOW HOW THIRSTY YOU GOT TO BE FOR A PICTURE WHERE YOU'RE WILLING TO WAIT WEEKS TO GET THAT LOOK? OOH! "WHAT YOU GOT ON RIGHT NOW, GIRL?" "HEY, WHAT YOU HAD ON WEEKS AGO?" THAT'S WHAT IT'S PRETTY MUCH LIKE. LAST LETTER. "I NEVER REALIZED THAT THE PLANS I HAD IN MIND WOULD BE SO TERRIFIC TO CARRY OUT." MM. "I'M SORRY IT IS THIS WAY, BUT DEAR, IT CAN'T BE HELPED." IT'S JUST LIKE, AT FIRST, HE WAS SO GUNG HO. BUT NOW, HE'S JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW, HE'S STARTING TO GIVE HER ALL THESE EXCUSES. "TAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF, DEAR." UH... DANG. AFTER READING THIS LAST BREAKUP LETTER FROM PRENTISS, I FEEL REALLY BAD FOR LaDELL. IT'S BECOMING CLEAR THAT LaDELL'S HEARTBREAK OVER HER LOVER IS WHAT CAUSED HER TO TAKE HER OWN LIFE. AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THESE DOPPELGANGERS ARE LaDELL'S WAY OF EXPRESSING HER PAIN. DUDE, IT WOULD BE DOPE IF WE COULD GENUINELY FIND SOMETHING ELSE IN THAT ATTIC. Marcus: YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GLAD THAT YOU SAID THAT. BECAUSE WHAT I'M THINKING IS YOU TWO GO UPSTAIRS... - OKAY. - I HAVE THE MONITOR DOWN HERE. WELL, MAN, LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN, BRO. CHOO, CHOO, CHOO, CHOO, CHOO, CHOO, CHOO, CHOO. AH, AH, AH, AH, AH, AH, AH, AH. SO, NOW, WE'RE GOING BACK INTO THE ATTIC. SO, RIGHT NOW, WHAT I GOT GOING ON IS DALEN AND JUWAN ARE ON THEIR SECOND ATTEMPT TO GO UPSTAIRS. NOW, HOPEFULLY, THEY'RE GONNA PULL SOME THINGS OUT. Dalen: ALL RIGHT. WE UP HERE NOW, HOMIE. BRO, I REALLY NEED FOR YOU TO STAY CLOSE, HOMIE. BRO, YOU MOVING TOO FAST, MAN. THERE THEY GO RIGHT THERE, CAMERA TWO. JUWAN HOLDING ON TIGHT. - CAN YOU SEE ANYTHING? - I DON'T SEE -- I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE'RE WALKING. SO YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING? NO, I SEE YOUR LEFT SHOULDER. LET'S MAKE OUR WAY TO THIS CORNER. AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN SET A... - BRO. - YEAH? Shh. JUWAN DOES NOT LOOK COMFORTABLE AT ALL. AND YOU CAN TELL THEY CAN'T SEE. SOMETHING IS DRAWING ME TO THIS LITTLE NOOK. I REALLY FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD SIT DOWN. [ POPPING ] WHAT'S THAT? THAT'S THE FLOOR. DO YOU HAVE YOUR EVP MACHINE ON? I ALWAYS HAVE MY EVP MACHINE ON. LaDELL, IS THIS YOUR SECRET PLACE? IS THIS WHERE YOU WOULD COME TO READ YOUR LETTERS? LaDELL, ARE YOU HERE? LaDELL, SPEAK TO ME. DO YOU BELIEVE IN LOVE STILL? HOLD ON A SECOND. THERE'S A LOT OF DUST GOING ON, ESPECIALLY IN THE SAME SPOT THAT THEY'RE IN. LIKE, IT'S NOT IN ANY OTHER SHOT. WHATEVER THEY'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW, THERE'S A LOT OF DUST. IT'S LIKE THIS, LaDELL, I'M GONNA BE HONEST. WE READ YOUR LETTERS. SOMETHING DOESN'T SIT RIGHT WITH ME. I HAVE THIS FEELING INSIDE. THE STORY IS INCOMPLETE. JOIN US FOR A MOMENT. SO, IF YOU ARE HERE, PLEASE REVEAL YOURSELF. LaDELL, WHEN A GOOD THING GOES BAD, IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. ALL THE DUST IS IN THAT AREA. I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF SESSION THEY MIGHT BE IN. PLEASE SIT DOWN AND JOIN US JUST FOR A MOMENT. COME SIT ON THE COUCH. [ PATS COUCH ] COME SIT ON THE COUCH. AH, ****! ****! JUWAN! WHAT?! LaDELL, ARE YOU HERE? RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN THE ALLEN HOUSE, UP IN THE ATTIC, TRYING TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE SPIRIT OF LaDELL. LaDELL, THE STORY IS INCOMPLETE. SO IF YOU ARE HERE, PLEASE REVEAL YOURSELF. WHATEVER THEY'RE SAYING RIGHT NOW, THERE'S A LOT OF DUST GOING ON, AND ESPECIALLY IN THE SAME SPOT THAT THEY'RE IN. JOIN US. COME SIT ON THE COUCH. [ PATS COUCH ] AH, ****! ****! JUWAN! - WHAT?! - I SWEAR TO GOD, MAN! WHAT?! DUDE, I SWEAR TO GOD, BRO, IT LITERALLY FELT LIKE SOMETHING SAT DOWN ON THE CUSHION RIGHT THERE ON THE END. WHERE YOU GOING? I'VE HAD IT ****, HOMIE. BRO, YOU'RE THE LIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DALEN. - JUWAN? - YES? BRO, COME ON, MAN. I CAN'T SEE ****, SO I'M NOT MOVING. WHERE ARE YOU, BRO? I'M SERIOUS. I CAN'T SEE YOU. WHERE ARE YOU? I'M IN THE SAME PLACE YOU LEFT ME. HEY, MAN, YOU MIGHT WANT TO COME OVER HERE, BRO. WHERE IS "OVER HERE"? COME TO MY VOICE, MAN. I'M NOT COMING BACK OVER THERE, BRO. I'M NOT. I'M NOT. I'M NOT. I'M NOT. - CLAP YOUR HANDS. - I'M NOT. I'M NOT. I'M NOT, BRO. JUWAN? YEAH. SOMETHING PRESSED DOWN ON THE SEAT. I CALLED FOR LaDELL TO SIT DOWN ON THE COUCH. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DID. IT LITERALLY FELT LIKE SOMEONE SAT DOWN ON THE CUSHION NEXT TO ME. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY SITS DOWN ON THE COUCH. YOU ACTING ALL NONCHALANT **** LIKE NOTHING JUST SAT DOWN ON THE COUCH NEXT TO YOU, BRO! LaDELL, I'D LIKE TO ISSUE AN APOLOGY FOR MY ABRASIVE FRIEND. ALL RIGHT, BRO. ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER. YOU CAN STAY YOUR ASS UP HERE, AND YOU TELL ME **** YOU FIND UP HERE THEN. DALEN? DALEN? HEY, DALEN? - MARCUS? - YO. - WHERE YOU AT, MARCUS? - DOWNSTAIRS. Dalen: MARCUS, COME HERE, BRO. DALEN? DUDE, MARCUS, LISTEN, BRO. I SAT DOWN ON THE COUCH. JUWAN WAS UP THERE TALKING TO LaDELL. AND, LITERALLY, IT FELT LIKE SOMEONE, ON MY LEFT-HAND SIDE, SAT DOWN ON IT. BRO, LET ME TELL YOU WHY THAT'S CRAZY. BECAUSE I SWEAR -- LOOK AT IT RIGHT NOW. LIKE, IT'S LIVE RIGHT NOW. YOU DON'T SEE ANY DUST PARTICLES. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, RIGHT HERE, WHEN Y'ALL WERE SITTING DOWN, OUT OF NOWHERE, WHOLE BUNCH OF DUST STARTED STIRRIN' UP. IS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER I HOPPED UP? BEFORE. - AND THEN I HOPPED UP? - AND THEN YOU HOPPED UP. I TOLD YOU, BRO, SOMETHING LITERALLY FELT LIKE IT SAT DOWN RIGHT NEXT TO ME. I'VE NEVER IN MY LIFE EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THAT. AND I JUST GENUINELY DON'T KNOW IF I CAN GO BACK IN THERE LIKE THAT, MAN. BRO, LIKE, OUR WHOLE POINT IN COMING HERE WAS TO GET AS CLOSE AS WE CAN GET -- RIGHT. BUT MY THING IS, WOULD YOU BE SAYING THAT IF SOMETHING SAT NEXT TO YOU? MY ONLY THING IS NOW THE COMMUNICATION IS THERE. YOU GOT CONTACT, MAN. LET'S DIG DEEPER, BRO. LIKE, DIG AS DEEP AS YOU CAN. LOOK, I'M DOWN WITH DIGGING. I'LL DIG ALL DAY LONG. BUT FOR NOW, I JUST WANT TO DIG SOMEWHERE ELSE OTHER THAN THIS ATTIC. IS THAT YOU BREATHIN' ON MY SHOULDER? YEAH, THAT'S... I'M A LITTLE HEAVY TODAY. Dalen: SO WE DECIDED TO SPLIT UP. JUWAN'S GONNA GO OUTSIDE AND INVESTIGATE WHILE ME AND MARCUS HEAD INTO THE DINING ROOM. WE'RE GONNA SET UP A CASKET AND SEE WHAT WE CAN STIR UP. OH, ****. WAIT, HOLD ON. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. HEY, DUDE. LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. OH, WHY IS OPEN, DAWG?! WHY WOULD IT BE CLOSED, HOMIE? 'CAUSE THIS IS SOME CREEPY -- DAWG. MARCUS, GET IN IT REAL QUICK, BRO. - GET IN WHAT? - THE CASKET. - WHY WOULD I JUMP IN THE CASKET? - THINK ABOUT IT, BRO. IF YOU GET IN THE CASKET, IT'LL AGITATE THE SPIRITS, BRO. I'M NOT GETTING IN THAT. WALK THAT WAY. UH, WALK WHICH WAY? - MAN, STOP PUSHING ME. - WALK THAT WAY, BRO. DAWG. IN FRONT OF THE CASKET. [ CELL PHONE RINGS ] BRO! MARCUS, THAT IS NOT YOUR CELL PHONE, MAN. SUG, I'M ACTUALLY, UH, IN A DINING ROOM WITH A CASKET RIGHT NOW. DALEN HAD THE DUMBEST IDEA. HE TOLD ME TO GET IN THE CASKET. BABY, NOR DO I. I LOVE YOU. I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. I LOVE YOU. - [ CELL PHONE BEEPS ] - GOT TO HANG UP. - YOU GOT TO HANG UP ON 'EM. - GOT TO HANG UP. HERE WE GO, GUYS. I'M IN FRONT OF THE ALLEN HOUSE. I GOT THE THERMAL CAM. OUR THERMAL CAMERA DETECTS HEAT SIGNATURES OF OBJECTS IN DARK ENVIRONMENTS. SO I'M GONNA SEE IF ANYTHING STANDS OUT. IT'S EXTRA WARM. I'M GONNA -- LET ME BACK UP 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE -- OH, ****. AH, ****. **** WHO HAS THORN BUSHES RIGHT NOW? SERIOUSLY? GHOSTING OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD. Dalen: I GOT THE PERFECT IDEA, BRO. NOBODY EVEN GOT TO GET IN THE CASKET. SO I'M GONNA SET THE REM-POD BACK HERE ON THE TABLE, RIGHT? WE'RE GONNA TRY TO SHARE A MOMENT WITH WHATEVER SPIRIT WE FEEL LIKE IS IN THE CASKET, ASKING QUESTIONS. AND LET'S SEE IF WE GET ANY RESPONSES THROUGH THE REM-POD. A REM-POD MEASURES THE CHANGE IN ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY. SO IF IT LIGHTS UP, THAT MEANS THERE'S PROBABLY A SPIRIT IN THE ROOM WITH US. YOU COME ANYWHERE NEAR -- IF ANY ENERGY COMES ANYWHERE NEAR THIS REM-POD, IT'S GONNA GO OFF. WELL, LET ME JUST SAY THIS. UM, FOR WHOEVER'S IN THE ROOM WITH US, WE'RE JUST REALLY TRYING TO INVESTIGATE JUST TO SEE WHO IS HERE, WHY YOU'RE HERE, AND HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN HERE. SO JUST TO START OFF, IS THERE ANY SPIRITS IN THIS ROOM? DOES THIS CASKET BRING BACK MEMORIES? - I THINK THE -- - [ BEEPING ] OH, ****! HEY, BROTHER. **** Marcus: FOR WHOEVER'S IN THE ROOM WITH US, WE'RE JUST REALLY TRYING TO INVESTIGATE JUST TO SEE WHO IS HERE, WHY YOU'RE HERE, HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN HERE. SO JUST TO START OFF, IS THERE ANY SPIRITS IN THIS ROOM? Dalen: DOES THIS CASKET BRING BACK MEMORIES? I THINK THE -- [ BEEPING ] OH, ****! HEY, BROTHER. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] **** SINCE THERE WERE SO MANY FUNERALS HELD IN THE DINING ROOM, MARCUS AND I DECIDED TO SET UP A CASKET AS BAIT. AND WE'RE GONNA USE THE REM-POD TO SEE IF WE CAN GET ANY TYPE OF RESPONSE. ALL RIGHT, SO NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE BEHIND US... ARE YOU UPSET THAT WE ARE HERE? WE JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS CASKET WAS NOT TO MAKE A MOCKERY OUT OF ANYONE IN THIS HOME. WE THANK YOU FOR, YOU KNOW, EVEN ALLOWING US EVEN COME HERE. AND WE REALLY CAME TO SHOW RESPECT. ARE WE WELCOMED HERE? [ BEEPING ] [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] BROTHER, THIS IS THE CREEPIEST THING. UM, WE WANT TO KNOW, IS LaDELL IN HERE? ARE MR. OR MRS. ALLEN IN HERE? [ BEEPS ] OH, COME ON, BLOOD! THAT IS THE SCARIEST **** I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE! OH, MY GOD. I'M ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE. I GOT MY THERMAL CAM. AND I'M TRYING TO SEE IF I COULD PICK UP ANY ACTIVITY. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WINDOW OF THE MASTER BEDROOM, WHERE LaDELL KILLED HERSELF. BUT ONE OF THE CRAZIEST EXPERIENCES IS FROM MARK. HE ACTUALLY WITNESSED HIS WIFE, REBECCA'S, DOPPELGANGER. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET CLOSER UP ON THAT BEDROOM, TO SEE IF WE CAN SEE SOME ACTIVITY. WHAT IS THAT? OH, ****. LOOK AT THE TOP WINDOW. IT'S A PERFECT RECTANGLE. LOOK AT THE BOTTOM WINDOW. SAME-SIZED WINDOW, BUT SOMETHING'S BLOCKING IT. OH, MY GOSH. THAT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING IN THAT WINDOW. I GOT TO UPSTAIRS TO CHECK THAT OUT. UM, MR. AND MRS. ALLEN... WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU LOVE THIS HOUSE. AND THIS HOUSE WAS HOME TO YOU AND ALL OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS. COME ON, BRO. IT'S JUST THE AIR CONDITIONER, BRO. WE REALLY WANTED TO JUST LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT WE WERE REALLY SADDENED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOUR DAUGHTER. LaDELL SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS A REALLY GOOD GIRL, AND WE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GET HER SIDE OF THE STORY OUT JUST SO THAT YOU POSSIBLY COULD LAY HER TO REST EVEN MORE. MR. AND MRS. ALLEN, ARE YOU STILL WITH US? MR. ALLEN, WOULD YOU LIKE THE CIGAR THAT I BROUGHT FOR YOU? UM, I HEARD THAT YOU -- OH, ****! [ BEEPING ] [ GASPS ] OH, MY GOD! SO I SEE THAT THAT'S YOUR STUFF. UM... OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. WHAT I'LL DO IS -- I'M SO SOR-- OH, MY GOSH, BRO. OKAY. WE GOT TO FIND JUWAN AND TELL HIM ABOUT THIS, BRO. MR. AND MRS. ALLEN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE'LL TRY TO, YOU KNOW, SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND IN THE HOUSE. ALL RIGHT, UM... HEY, BRO, DON'T TELL JUWAN I GRABBED YOU WHEN I GOT SCARED, BRO. [ BEEPING ] Juwan: YO, GUYS, COME ON! MEET ME IN LaDELL'S BEDROOM! - JUWAN! - WHAT'D YOU SAY, JUWAN? Juwan: YO, I THINK I JUST GOT SOMETHING. - WHY YOU RUNNING, BRO? - I GOT TO CATCH THIS! - WHAT'S GOIN' ON, BRO? - WHAT'S UP, BRO? FELLAS, YO, SO I'M DOING A WIDE SHOT WITH THE THERMAL CAM OUTSIDE. WHY YOU BREATHING SO HARD? WELL, 'CAUSE I JUST RAN UPSTAIRS, MAN. CHECK IT OUT. THIS ROOM AND THAT WINDOW IS WHERE MARK SAID HE SAW REBECCA'S DOPPELGANGER. RIGHT, RIGHT. RIGHT? SO YOU LOOK AT THIS WINDOW, IT WAS ALMOST LIKE THIS ASPECT OF THE WINDOW WAS HOT. AND THE OTHER ONE'S COLD? THIS PART, WHERE I'M AT, POSITIONED, WAS COLD. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE, LITERALLY, SOMETHING WAS HERE. IT WAS ALMOST LIKE SOMETHING WAS LOOKING BACK AT ME, LIKE THIS. BROTHER, I'M NOT DOUBTING YOU AT ALL BECAUSE, MAN, THE STUFF THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN IN THIS HOUSE... THIS ONLY FURTHER VERIFIES IT. WE'VE HAD AN ENCOUNTER IN THE DINING ROOM, BRO. Y'ALL HAD THAT SITUATION HAPPEN IN THE ATTIC, DAWG. LIKE, EVERY OTHER ROOM WE'VE BEEN IN, WE'VE SEEN -- WE'VE HAD EXPERIENCES. SO I THINK IT'S ONLY RIGHT THAT WE KIND OF, LIKE, BRING THE INVESTIGATION HERE. DO Y'ALL REALLY FEEL LIKE LaDELL IS GONNA SHOW HERSELF WHEN THERE'S THREE OF US IN HERE LIKE THIS, THREE BLACK GUYS? YOU THINK SHE GONNA SHOW HERSELF? LISTEN. I GOT IT. HOW ABOUT WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN ALONE TIME? LIKE I GET TO HAVE A DATE WITH LaDELL? I MEAN, IF YOU PUT IT THAT WAY, IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE, YEAH, LIKE A -- I MEAN, SHE WAS LOOKING FOR LOVE. BUT WE ALL NEED TO HAVE THAT INTIMATE MOMENT WITH LaDELL, MAN. LET'S SHARE THAT WITH HER AND SEE WHAT WE CAN GET OUT OF HER. I THINK THAT'S A PLAN, BRO. THAT'S IT. LET'S GO. Juwan: SO WE'RE GONNA SPLIT UP INTO DIFFERENT ROOMS DOWNSTAIRS WHILE WE ALL GET READY FOR OUR DATE WITH LaDELL. I'M GONNA HANG OUT ON THE FOYER WHILE MARCUS AND DALEN ARE GOING INTO THE PARLOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE. HEY, WAIT, WHOA. HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, MARCUS? WHERE'D YOU COME FROM? Juwan: HOLY ****. I'M ALONE IN THE FOYER. AND MARCUS AND DALEN ARE IN THE PARLOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE. AND SOMEONE CREEPS UP BEHIND ME. WHOA. HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, MARCUS? WHERE'D YOU COME FROM? UH, RIGHT BEHIND YOU? OKAY. BRO. I MEAN, I DID A WALK-AROUND. I'M NOT A DOPPELGANGER, I PROMISE YOU. ALL RIGHT. I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE YOU A DOPPELGANGER CHECK. OKAY, I SAW THAT. I HEARD IT IN YOUR VOICE. YEAH. I DIDN'T KNOW. MAN, I THOUGHT I HAD MYSELF A DOPPELGANGER. SERIOUSLY, I WAS CREEPED OUT BECAUSE THESE SPIRITS CAN BE EVIL. BUT IT TURNS OUT IT WAS THE REAL MARCUS. SO, ANYWAY, IT'S TIME TO GET READY FOR OUR Q.T. WITH LaDELL. LaDELL, GREETINGS. A GENTLEMAN NEVER COMES EMPTY-HANDED, SO I FIGURED I'D BRING YOU A BOTTLE. THIS CAT'S HAVING A DATE. I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TELL YOU, YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLY BEAUTIFUL. I THINK JUWAN'S SMOOTH ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS PLAN ACTUALLY WORK. I THINK YOU DESERVE TO BE LOVED. AND I'M HERE TO GIVE THAT TO YOU. "HI, I'M JUWAN, AND I CROSS MY LEGS WHEN I'M ON A DATE." I'M A REAL DUDE. JUWAN THINKS HE'S SOME GHOST-WHISPERING BARRY WHITE. I THINK YOU DESERVE TO HAVE A MAN THAT KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS. I DON'T THINK JUWAN IS GETTING ANYTHING FROM HER, BRO. HE MIGHT NOT BE HER TYPE. [ SIGHS ] GUESS I'M UP NEXT, BROTHER. HOW I LOOK, MAN? HEY, MAN, YOU FRESH, BUT HEY. WHAT'S UP? YOU'RE NOT JUWAN FRESH, BUT YOU GOOD ENOUGH. MY BREATH HITTING, THOUGH? YEAH, IT'S HITTING. SO, UH... LOOK, LaDELL, I'M PRETTY SURE I'M NOT YOUR TYPE, BUT I REALLY FEEL LIKE WE CAN GET THIS PLATONIC THING GOING. I'M OKAY WITH YOU NOT LIKING ME, BABY. WE COULD BE REALLY GOOD FRIENDS. HIS BODY LANGUAGE AIN'T LIKE MINE. SO HOW ABOUT WE JUST HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION, LaDELL? LIKE, I JUST REALLY WISH THAT YOU COULD JUST SHARE WITH ME WHAT HAPPENED. IT'S CRAZY. I ACTUALLY HAD A FRIEND WHO KILLED HIMSELF 2 MONTHS AGO. I JUST WISH, BETWEEN YOU AND MY FRIEND, THAT YOU GUYS JUST TOOK THE TIME TO REALLY JUST TALK TO SOMEONE. YOUR LIFE WASN'T MEANT TO BE OVER. MY FRIEND'S LIFE WASN'T MEANT TO BE OVER. WHILE I WAS SPEAKING MY PIECE TO LaDELL, IT ALMOST TURNED INTO A VENTING SESSION FOR ME AND HER LISTENING TO ME. I DON'T KNOW, LaDELL, IF YOU ARE HERE... AND YOU DO HAVE ACCESS TO THE OTHER SIDE... JUST TELL MY FRIEND THAT WE ALL CARE. YO, BOSS. WHAT'S UP? HEY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU, BUT... UH, WELL, EXCUSE ME, LaDELL, IF YOU DON'T MIND ME STEPPING OUT FOR A SECOND. Marcus: SO WE GAVE THIS WHOLE DATING THING A TRY. LaDELL AIN'T REALLY FEELING NONE OF US. SO WE'RE GONNA GO CHECK OUT SOME MORE KNOWN HOT SPOTS THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE. DALEN, HE'S GONNA GO UPSTAIRS. AND I KNOW ME AND JUWAN, WE'RE GONNA GO HIT THAT KITCHEN. - WE'RE IN THE HALLWAY... - OKAY. Marcus: ENTERING INTO THE KITCHEN RIGHT NOW. THIS IS WHERE SHE MAKES HER CLAIM THAT SHE SAW HER DOPPELGANGER, IN THIS AREA RIGHT HERE. REBECCA HAS CLAIMED THAT SHE'S SEEN HER OWN DOPPELGANGER IN THE KITCHEN, WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE A BAD OMEN. WE'RE GONNA INVESTIGATE THE KITCHEN AND SEE WHAT WE CAN CONFIRM AND WHETHER IT HAS ANY CONNECTION TO LaDELL. HOW DO YOU REALLY PULL OUT A DOPPELGANGER? HMM. LET'S TRY THIS. THEY SAY THE DOPPELGANGER WAS OPENING CABINETS, RIGHT? UH-HUH. JUST DON'T BREAK IT, THOUGH. I'M NOT GONNA BREAK IT, MAN. HERE WE GO. WE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE BAIT MOMENT, RIGHT? MM-HMM. HOW ABOUT I LEAVE THESE CABINETS LIKE THIS... AND WE COME BACK AND SEE IF THEY MOVE. SHE MAY BE OCD. YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT KIND OF MAKES SENSE. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS BEHIND DOOR NUMBER THREE? OH. THAT'S A COMMODE. RESTROOM? YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE TOILET, MAN. WE LEAVE THAT OPEN. NO SELF-RESPECTING INDIVIDUAL, IF THEY HAVE A BATHROOM IN THE KITCHEN... LEAVES IT OPEN. - PUT THE CAMERA... - UH-HUH? ...ON THAT END OF THE COUNTER. SO I GOT THE CABINETS. AND I GOT THE DOOR. ALL ARE IN THERE. WE CAN KIND OF INVESTIGATE. AND THEN WE COME BACK. MAYBE SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN. ALL RIGHT? LET'S CHECK IT OUT. THIS IS WHERE THERE'S BEEN COUNTLESS CLAIMS OF ACTIVITY, IN THIS HALLWAY. THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL CLAIMS OF A FEMALE APPARITION WALKING AROUND UP HERE WHO CLOSELY RESEMBLES LaDELL. FOR SOME REASON, I KEEP GETTING DRAWN TO THIS AREA OVER HERE. [ INHALES SHARPLY ] I GET A CHILL, GENUINELY, IN THIS AREA. I'M GONNA SET UP A CAMERA ON THE FLOOR IN THIS HALLWAY. AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS I'M GONNA PUT BABY POWDER ON THE FLOOR WITH THE CAMERA RUNNING. THAT WAY, IF ANYTHING OR ANYONE WALKS THROUGH THIS AREA, THEY WILL HAVE TO WALK DIRECTLY THROUGH THE BABY POWDER. HOPEFULLY, WE CAN CATCH SOME TYPE OF DISTURBANCE OR MARKINGS IN THE POWDER. [ THUD ] **** THAT NOISE. IF ANYONE IS UP HERE, FEEL FREE TO COME PLAY. IF THERE'S ANY SHADOW FIGURES IN HERE, NOW IS YOUR TIME. SHOW YOURSELF. COME OUT, COME OUT WHEREVER YOU ARE. [ HOWL ] OH, ****! Dalen: WE HAVE THE POWDER SET UP HERE. IF THERE'S ANY SHADOW FIGURES IN HERE, NOW IS YOUR TIME. SHOW YOURSELF. COME OUT, COME OUT WHEREVER YOU ARE. [ HOWL ] OH, ****! [ CAT MEOWS ] COME ON, MAN. COME... THIS HOUSE IS FULL OF CATS. [ MEOWING ] [ CREAK, THUD ] Juwan: BRO, I KNOW YOU JUST HEARD THAT COMING FROM THE KITCHEN. MARCUS AND I JUST LEFT THE KITCHEN, WHERE THE HOMEOWNER, REBECCA, CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN HER OWN DOPPELGANGER OPENING AND CLOSING CABINETS. WE JUST HEARD A NOISE COMING FROM THE KITCHEN, WHICH IS PRETTY STRANGE BECAUSE DALEN IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR. MARCUS, TAKE A STEP. YO. HOLY ****. YO, DAWG. FOR REAL, THAT DOOR IS CLOSED. - WE LEFT IT OPEN. - DUDE. MARCUS AND I WENT TO THE KITCHEN. WE TRIED TO SET A FEW THINGS AS BAIT, SUCH AS THE CABINET DOORS AND THE BATHROOM DOOR. WE LEFT BOTH OF THOSE OPEN. WE SET UP OUR VIDEO CAMERA. AND WE LEFT THE ROOM. CAME BACK, BATHROOM DOOR WAS CLOSED. ALL RIGHT. LET ME TRY THIS, THOUGH. YOU THINK THE DOOR MOVED ON ITS OWN? YEAH. I'M GONNA SEE IF THAT DID. AW, NAH, MAN. I HAD IT OPEN. TRY IT. LET IT GO. [ LAUGHS ] DUDE. HEY, OKAY. I'LL CLOSE IT. LISTEN. THAT BATHROOM DOOR, IT'S NOT HEAVY ENOUGH TO WHERE IT WOULD JUST, LIKE, MOVE ON ITS OWN, BECAUSE IT DIDN'T MOVE. THAT'S CRAZY, BROTHER. BUT THE GOOD THING IS WE HAVE OUR TRUSTY, DUSTY CAMERA. CAN YOU SEE ME RIGHT NOW? I CAN SEE YOU RIGHT NOW. PERFECT. WE GOT YOU. MM-HMM. GO AHEAD AND PLAY IT BACK, MAN. YO, CHECK OUT THE DOOR, MAN. OH, MY GOD. HEY, LISTEN, AMERICA, THE ALLEN HOUSE IS HAUNTED. GET THE CAMERA, MAN. LET'S GO. WE GOT A LOT OF HEAVY ACTIVITY IN THIS HOUSE TONIGHT, LIKE THE ATTIC. HOT SPOT. LaDELL, COME SIT ON THE COUCH. **** **** JUWAN! WHAT?! I GENUINELY FELT SOMEONE SIT NEXT TO ME ON THAT COUCH. IT COULD HAVE BEEN LaDELL, SINCE WE INVITED HER TO COME SIT WITH US. AND REMEMBER, JUST BEFORE THAT, I SAW THAT DUST KICK UP. THERE'S A LOT OF DUST GOING ON, ESPECIALLY IN THE SAME SPOT THAT THEY'RE IN. ALL THE DUST IS IN THAT AREA. I REALLY THINK THAT THAT WAS REALLY HER, YOU KNOW, REACHING OUT. AND THEN WE HAD THE OCCURRENCES IN THE DINING ROOM, MAN, WITH THE CASKET. DOES THIS CASKET BRING BACK MEMORIES? - I THINK THE... - [ BEEPING ] OH, ****. HEY, BROTHER. BEEP-BEEP-BEEP- BEEP-BEEP-BEEP. IT WENT OFF AS SOON AS WE ASKED FOR MR. AND MRS. ALLEN. IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN ONE OF 'EM. - CRAZY, DAWG. - UNDENIABLE. I CAN'T FORGET MY THERMAL CAM FOOTAGE. WHAT IS THAT? SOMETHING'S BLOCKING IT, LIKE, ALMOST LIKE THE PRESENCE OF SOMETHING BEING IN THAT WINDOW. THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THIS HOME. THAT LITTLE KITCHEN INCIDENT WE HAD? OH, ****. - WE LEFT IT OPEN. - DUDE. - THE DOOR WAS CLOSED, DAWG. - BUT YOU GOT IT ON TAPE. YEAH, DAWG. Juwan: OH, MY GOD. I'M CONVINCED THIS HOUSE HAS WAY MORE THAN JUST THE FEW LIVING BODIES. IT'S SAFE TO SAY THE SPENCERS HAVE ROOMMATES. Dalen: WE CAME HERE TONIGHT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT LaDELL'S STORY AND TO SEE IF HER SPIRIT IS WHAT WAS CAUSING THE DOPPELGANGERS. EVEN THOUGH WE DIDN'T GET TO EXPERIENCE THE DOPPELGANGERS OURSELVES, I THINK THAT WE DEFINITELY MADE CONTACT WITH LaDELL AND POSSIBLY HER FAMILY MEMBERS. [ HORN HONKS ] I JUST CAN'T SEE IN THIS DARK. DON'T YOU GUYS LEAVE ME. Dalen: GOOD JOB, FELLAS. Juwan: LaDELL, WE LOVE YOU, GIRL. THE ALLEN HOUSE ALMOST GOT THE BEST OF THE GHOST BROTHERS, MAN. GHOST BROTHERS GHOSTING OUT!
