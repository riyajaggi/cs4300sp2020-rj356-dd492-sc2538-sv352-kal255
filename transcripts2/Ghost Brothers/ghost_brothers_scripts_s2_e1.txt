WOW. - BRO, MURDER... - MM-HMM. - ...ATTEMPTED MURDER. - MM-HMM. THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF JUST BAD ENERGY THERE. THAT'S A CRAZY "SVU" EPISODE. I KNOW. - ♪ DUN, DUN, DUN, DUN ♪ Dalen: AT THE TURN OF THE 20th CENTURY, REUBEN BAILEY AND HIS FAMILY BECAME CARETAKERS OF THORNHAVEN MANOR. IN 1906, REUBEN WAS LIVING IN THE HOME WITH HIS WIFE, TWO DAUGHTERS AND HIS SON-IN-LAW, FRANK THURMAN. FRANK THURMAN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HIS SISTER-IN-LAW, WHO THEN BECAME PREGNANT. WHEN THE FAMILY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE RAPE, THEY DECIDED TO TURN FRANK INTO THE POLICE. BUT FRANK KNEW ABOUT THEIR PLAN. THE NEXT DAY, BEFORE THEY COULD CONTACT THE AUTHORITIES, HE PUT ARSENIC IN THE FAMILY'S MORNING COFFEE. A FEW MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY DRANK THE COFFEE AND BECAME SICK FROM THE POISON. BUT THE FATHER, REUBEN BAILEY, HE DIED. SO THE GUY TRIED TO KILL EVERYBODY. OH, HE TRIED TO TAKE EVERYBODY OUT. - BUT HE ONLY GOT THE DAD? - HE ONLY GOT THE DAD. Dalen: FRANK THURMAN DIED LATER IN PRISON. I'D REALLY LIKE TO FIND OUT IF THE TWO OF THEM ARE THERE OR IF ANY OF THE BAILEYS ARE THERE AND IF THEY ARE IN AN ETERNAL STRUGGLE AT THORNHAVEN MANOR. WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CLAIMS THEY HAVE IN THERE, THOUGH? SO PEOPLE HAVE SEEN SHADOW FIGURES. - UH-HUH. - PEOPLE HAVE SEEN, YOU KNOW, APPARITION, DISEMBODIED VOICES, MAN, THE WHOLE NINE, BRO. THEY SAY THE SPIRITS HERE ARE REALLY AGGRESSIVE. I MEAN, I JUST REALLY WANT TO GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF ACTUALLY WHO'S HAUNTING THIS MANOR, BRO. IS IT MR. BAILEY? - IT COULD BE FRANK. - IT COULD BE FRANK. - UH-HUH. PEOPLE STILL THINK THE BAILEY FAMILY'S STILL THERE LINGERING, MAN, TRYING TO GET THEIR STORY OUT. SO I GUESS WE GOT TO GO THERE AND CHECK IT OUT THERE, RIGHT? YEAH, MAN. TIME TO START GHOSTING. Marcus: INDIANA, COOL. ANY TIME IT'S A HOME, I GET REALLY EXCITED. IN THOSE HOMES, MOST OF THOSE SPIRITS ARE, LIKE, VERY TERRITORIAL. - LIKE, THEY'RE POSSESSIVE. BECAUSE IT'S THEIR CRIB. I KIND OF FEEL LIKE IT MAY BE FRANK THURMAN. IT'S PROBABLY REUBEN, MAN. 'CAUSE I WOULD BE PISSED IF SOMEBODY TRIED TO TAKE ME AND MY FAMILY OUT, AND YOU DID THAT TO MY DAUGHTER. I'D BE LINGERING AROUND, TOO, IF I'M WAKING UP FOR A MORNING CUP OF JOE... YEAH. ...AND I DIE OFF OF SOME RAT POISON. BRO, I AIN'T LEAVING THE CRIB AFTER THAT, DAWG. SO YOU THINK REUBEN MAY BE LINGERING, TRYING TO SEE IF FRANK SHOW UP? BRO, REUBEN OUT HERE LOOKING FOR REVENGE. WHEN I CATCH FRANK... OH, I'M GONNA LET HIM HAVE IT. - IF -- IT'S -- IT'S ON-SITE. - IT'S ON-SITE, BRO. IT'S GONNA BE SOME SMOKE IN THE CITY. OH, MY GOD. IS THAT "AMITYVILLE HORROR"? THERE IS NOTHING GOOD GONNA COME OUT OF THIS PROPERTY. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S CRYING. WHY DOES A HOUSE LOOK LIKE IT'S CRYING? HERE GOES NOTHING. IS THIS ON AIRBNB? Dalen: SO WE'RE ABOUT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE AFTER THE BAILEYS MOVED IN FROM THE CURRENT OWNER, STEVEN MILLER. I'M DALEN, STEVE. - NICE TO MEET YOU, GUYS. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, MAN. Marcus: TELL US ABOUT THE HOUSE, MAN. TELL US ABOUT THE MANOR. WHAT ARE A FEW OF THE CLAIMS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THE PLACE SO FAR? WELL, THERE'S A LOT OF JUST PERSONAL STUFF THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME. YOU HEAR FOOTSTEPS, VOICES. I'VE BEEN TOUCHED A FEW TIMES ACTUALLY IN THE BASEMENT. - AND IT WASN'T BY AN ANGEL? - NO, IT WASN'T BY AN ANGEL. NO DELLA REESE IN THIS ONE? NOT THIS TIME, NOT THIS TIME. IT SEEMS TO BE MORE NEGATIVE, SORRY TO SAY, TOWARDS GUYS. Dalen: EVER SINCE FRANK THURMAN DIED IN PRISON, PEOPLE HAVE SEEN APPARITIONS THEY BELIEVE ARE THE SPIRITS OF BOTH FRANK AND REUBEN. THESE CLAIMS CONTINUE TO THIS DAY. IN THE BASEMENT, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KIDNEY PUNCHED, SEEN MISTS FLOATING AND HEARD VOICES. IT'S REPORTED THE ENTITY IS NEGATIVE TOWARDS MEN. THE BREAKFAST NOOK IS THE ROOM WHERE REUBEN BAILEY DIED. PEOPLE HAVE CLAIMED TO CATCH EVPs IN THIS ROOM AND SEEN OBJECTS MOVING. WHILE IN THE DINING ROOM, A PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION TEAM PICKED UP EVPs FROM FRANK THURMAN. [ INDISTINCT VOICE ] IT TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF A SHADOW FIGURE. PEOPLE HAVE HEARD FOOTSTEPS ON THE SECOND FLOOR. [ FOOTSTEPS ] FIGURES HAVE BEEN PICKED UP ON THERMAL CAMERAS IN THE SERVANT'S ROOM AS WELL AS FOOTAGE OF APPARITIONS. ROCKS HAVE BEEN THROWN AND SHADOW FIGURES HAVE BEEN SEEN ON THE STAIRCASE THAT LEADS TO THE SECOND FLOOR. SO STEVE INTRODUCED US TO LOCAL PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR BARB WYATT, WHO HAD A LOT OF UNEXPLAINED THINGS HAPPEN TO HER IN THIS HOUSE. I'VE BEEN HERE ABOUT SIX TIMES NOW. AND WE CAUGHT ALL KINDS OF EVPs. WE'VE HEARD SINGING, VOICES, SEEN APPARITIONS. WE ACTUALLY CAUGHT A FULL-BODIED APPARITION IN THIS ROOM, WALK FROM THIS SIDE OF THE WALL TO ABOUT HALFWAY ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THEN JUST VANISHED. SO WHAT ELSE HAPPENED TO YOU? UH, WE DID AN EVP SESSION DOWN IN THE DINING ROOM AND A MAN COME ACROSS. SO I ASK IF IT WAS FRANK THURMAN WHO POISONED REUBEN BAILEY AND HIS FAMILY HERE. AND HE TOLD US "YES." SO HE JUST CONFESSED TO Y'ALL LIKE THAT? HE CONFESSED TO US JUST LIKE THAT. DID Y'ALL EVEN GIVE HIM A DINNER OR ANYTHING, LIKE... LIKE, WARM HIM UP A LITTLE BIT? LIKE "THE FIRST 48" OR SOMETHING? HE JUST GONNA SNITCH ON HIMSELF? NO, HE CAME RIGHT THROUGH AND JUST STARTED TALKING. - WOW. - SO YOU DON'T THINK REUBEN MAY HANG OUT HERE AT ALL? I THINK REUBEN'S HERE, TOO. HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY TYPE OF BEEF? YEAH, YEAH. ANY TYPE OF LIKE... SPIRITUAL BEEF? - WE HAVE HAD THAT ON EVPs. - EXPLAIN THAT. NOW, YOU CAN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT. BUT YOU CAN TELL IT'S TWO MALES. AND THEY'RE NOT HAPPY WITH EACH OTHER. SO HAVE YOU STAYED AT LEAST ONE NIGHT IN THIS PLACE SINCE YOU GOT IT? I HAVE NEVER SPENT THE NIGHT HERE, NO. THIS IS YOUR HOME. SO YOU BOUGHT IT AND LIKE, "NO, I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD ON THIS ONE. I'M JUST GONNA STAY IN THE CAR." I'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER. I'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT BRAVER OVER TIME. NOW THAT I GOT MY LITTLE CAT OOGLY, I CAN STAY HERE A LITTLE BIT LONGER. DOES OOGLY SEEM TO SENSE THINGS AROUND THE HOUSE? YEAH, HE'S A LITTLE INVESTIGATOR. WHEN HE -- WHEN YOU INVESTIGATE, HE STAYS WITH YOU AND HE NOTICES THE SAME THINGS I NOTICE. I'M LIKE, "GOOD, IT'S NOT JUST ME." SO WAIT. WHEN YOU SENSE SOMETHING, OOGLY'S LIKE, "MEOW"? [ DOOR SLAMS ] YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT? SOMETHING HAPPENED BACK THERE, HUH? COME ON, DAWG. HOLD ON A SECOND. - THAT DOOR SHOULD BE CLOSED. - WHOA. - WHICH DOOR WAS IT? - ALL RIGHT. - SO NOW, YOU SAID... - THE CHAIN'S STILL SWINGING. Marcus: NOW, YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S -- IT MIGHT HAVE JUST BEEN THE DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING, RIGHT? NO, I KEEP EVERYTHING CLOSED BECAUSE THE CAT. Juwan: TRY TO PUSH IT. THERE -- YEAH, YOU GOT TO REALLY PUSH. THAT -- THAT'S HOW MUCH FORCE I HAD TO PUT ON IT TO PUSH THAT. THIS IS THE SOUND, WATCH. WAS THAT THE SOUND Y'ALL HEARD? - THAT'S THE SOUND THAT I HEARD. THAT WAS THE SOUND. - [ DOOR SLAMS ] - YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT? SOMETHING HAPPENED BACK... THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED. I MEAN, WE'VE NEVER HAD ANY ACTIVITY DURING, LIKE, AN INVESTIGATION DURING THE DAY. BUT THESE, I GUESS THEY STAY UP ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT. THEY AIN'T GOT NO JOB. Dalen: IF THIS IS GOING ON IN THE DAYTIME, WHAT YOU THINK GONNA HAPPEN AT NIGHT? THE ONLY THING LEFT TO GO IS TO SET UP BECAUSE OUR MISSION, LIKE ALWAYS, IS TO FIND OUT WHO IS HAUNTING THIS PLACE. I MEAN, COULD IT BE FRANK THURMAN OR HIS VICTIM, REUBEN BAILEY, OR MAYBE EVEN ANYONE ELSE IN THE BAILEY FAMILY? I DON'T KNOW. WE GOT TO GET DOWN TO THE TRUTH. Marcus: I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR THUR-- - [ CAT MEOWS ] - IS THAT OOGLY AGAIN? THAT'S WHAT I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO, OOGLY BEING IN OUR INVESTIGATION. HE'S LIKE A BAROMETER FOR PARANORMAL, LIKE, ACTIVITY. AND HE'S BEEN THERE FOR YEARS. I MEAN, WHEN WE GET OOGLY ON THE CASE, WE'RE GONNA BE GOOD. HEY, GUYS. I'M GONNA BE HONEST. I FEEL LIKE NIGHTFALL GOT HERE A LITTLE TOO SOON. WELL, IT USUALLY FALLS AROUND THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY. BRO, THIS PLACE LOOKS EVEN SCARIER AT NIGHT. WHAT, YOU THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE BETTER? I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER, BUT I DON'T KNOW, MAN. - FELLAS? - MM-HMM. - I GOT A DOPE IDEA. - WHAT'S THAT? I REALLY FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD RE-CREATE THAT BREAKFAST WHERE THE FAMILY GOT POISONED. THAT COULD BE LIKE A TRIGGER OBJECT, MAN, RE-CREATING THAT WHOLE SCENE. - YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS, GUYS. - OKAY. TIME TO POP THE... [ HORN HONKING ] OH, SNAP. OKAY, UM... - BRO? NO, WAIT. HOLD ON -- HOLD ON A SECOND, DAWG. HOLD ON A SECOND, CALM DOWN, GUYS. OKAY, POP THE TRUNK. THAT'S WHAT WE DO. FELLAS, WE GOT THE THINGS GOING ON RIGHT NOW, SLS CAM. - SLS CAM. OKAY. - SOMEBODY HOLD THIS UP. LET'S GET TO IT. Marcus: HEY, GUYS. HOW Y'ALL DOING? WE HERE. Dalen: SINCE WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOME ACTIVITY IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM, YOU KNOW, THE SIGHT OF REUBEN BAILEY'S MURDER, IT'S ONLY RIGHT THAT THAT'S WHERE WE START OUR INVESTIGATION. TO START THE NIGHT OFF RIGHT, WE HAVE A PRETTY AWESOME PLAN TO TRY TO STIR SOME ACTIVITY WITH SOME OF THE BAILEYS OR MAYBE EVEN THE MURDERER HIMSELF, FRANK THURMAN. LET'S GET THESE THINGS POPPING. WE SET THIS BREAKFAST SITUATION UP JUST TO KIND OF, LIKE, RE-CREATE THAT WHOLE LAST SCENE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? I DON'T KNOW. HOPEFULLY, THIS RIGHT HERE CAN KIND OF CONJURE UP SOME ACTIVITY IN HERE. BRO, ABOUT TIME WITH THIS... - WHAT, BRO? - HOLD ON A SECOND, DAWG. Dalen: WOULD ANYONE LIKE SOME COFFEE? BRO, ARE YOU DRESSED UP BECAUSE THE PICTURE THAT WE SAW EARLIER? ARE YOU TRYING TO CHANNEL FRANK THURMAN? I WILL CALL THIS VISUAL PROVOKING. SO WE'RE GONNA RE-CREATE THE MOMENT THAT FRANK ACTUALLY POISONED HIS FAMILY. SO LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN STIR UP, NO PUN INTENDED. WE'RE AT THE TABLE. SO NOW THAT WE HAVE THE REM-POD SET UP, YOU ARE KIND OF DRESSED LIKE HIM. THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BRING OUT REUBEN. SO THAT MIGHT BE IT. - I'LL ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS. LET ME MAKE SURE THE REM-POD IS ACTIVE, OKAY. WHOA, THERE IT GOES. IS REUBEN BAILEY HERE? ARE ANY OF THE BAILEYS HERE? WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO JOIN US FOR BREAKFAST? I'M GONNA WALK AROUND A LITTLE BIT. MAYBE THAT WILL... - STIR SOMETHING UP. DOES THIS COFFEE BRING BACK MEMORIES? DOES THIS BREAKFAST BRING BACK MEMORIES? - [ BEEPING ] - WOW. IS REUBEN BAILEY HERE? DOES THIS COFFEE BRING BACK MEMORIES? DOES THIS BREAKFAST BRING BACK MEMORIES? - [ BEEPING ] - WOW. OKAY, NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE. OKAY. [ BEEPING STOPS ] OKAY, TYPICALLY THE REM-POD DOESN'T JUST -- [ BEEPING RESUMES ] IT'S GOING NAE NAE NOW. - BECAUSE IT'S BREAKFAST. - OKAY, IT'S THE BREAKFAST. Dalen: SO MARCUS, JUWAN AND MYSELF ARE IN THE ROOM WHERE REUBEN BAILEY WAS ACTUALLY MURDERED. HOPEFULLY, BY RE-CREATING THIS BREAKFAST, WE CAN STIR UP SOME KIND OF ACTIVITY. AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M CHANNELING THE YOUNG FRANK THURMAN WITH HOPES OF VISUALLY PROVOKING SOMEONE OR SOMETHING TO MAKE A GRAND APPEARANCE. FRANK THURMAN, DO I REMIND YOU OF YOURSELF? ARE ANY OF THE BAILEYS IN HERE? I THINK THIS ONE IS DONE RIGHT NOW, BRO. Juwan: MAN, SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH DALEN, BUT I DO GIVE HIM HIS PROPS, BRAH. HE'S TAKING THIS ALL THE WAY. I'M GONNA LEAVE THIS BOTTLE OF RAT POISON RIGHT HERE. IF YOU WANT TO USE IT, IT'S THERE FOR YOUR LIKING AND FOR YOUR TAKING. LET'S HEAD TO THE BASEMENT. I THINK WE SHOULD, FOR SURE, GRAB THE SLS. ALL RIGHT. AND I'M GONNA GRAB THIS. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. Dalen: SO THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. THERE'S A PERSON. MARCUS IS RIGHT THERE. AND YOU CATCH THE STICK FIGURE OF THE PERSON. MARCUS, LIFT YOUR RIGHT ARM. YOU SEE HOW THE STICK FIGURE GOES UP? SO IF WE CATCH ANY STICK FIGURE LIKE THAT, AND THERE'S NO PERSON AROUND, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE'S SOMETHING RIGHT THERE. - THAT'S AN ANOMALY. - SO LET'S GO. Juwan: SO RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE FRANK THURMAN POISONED REUBEN BAILEY. Dalen: THERE, L-- LOO-- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK. BRO, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE IN HERE. IF YOU'RE FRANK THURMAN, PLEASE SHOW YOURSELF. ARE YOU REUBEN? YES, RIGHT THERE. HE POPPED UP, POPPED UP, POPPED UP -- SHH, SHH, RIGHT THERE. - OKAY, REUBEN. - HE GOT CLOSER TO YOU. HE JUST WALKED L-- LITERALLY THROUGH YOU. WHEN IT WENT THROUGH ME, DID IT GO, LIKE, TOWARDS THE BASEMENT? - YES, YES. - OKAY, BOOM. WE DON'T NEED NO MORE TIME. - GO AROUND THIS STUFF. - ALL RIGHT. Dalen: OH, IT'S DOWN THERE. IT'S ON THE STEPS. IT'S DEFINITELY IN THE BASEMENT. Marcus: SO I'M GONNA LEAVE THIS SHADOW DETECTOR RIGHT HERE. AND THEN WATCH THAT LAST STEP, IT'S A LONG STEP. Marcus: RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN THE BASEMENT. THERE'S BEEN CLAIMS OF BEING... TAPPED ON THE SHOULDER. ...TAPPED ON THE SHOULDER, SHADOW FIGURES. Dalen: WELL, REUBEN, WE FOLLOWED YOU INTO THE BASEMENT. SHOW US WHERE YOU WANT US TO GO. Y'ALL STAY STILL. Dalen: LET ME TELL YOU WHAT'S CREEPY, MAN. I THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT... OH, THIS -- THIS -- THIS SPIRIT MIGHT HAVE HAD, LIKE, A HIGH... - HE HAD A 4.0? - A HIGH SAT SCORE, LIKE... - A 1,600? - 1,600 AT LEAST. HE HAD A PERFECT SAT SCORE? BRAH, THIS -- THIS SPIRIT DOWN HERE, I THINK IT MIGHT KNOW MANDARIN. THAT'S HOW SMART THIS ONE MIGHT BE. Dalen: WHERE ARE YOU? I CAN SEE YOU. SHOW YOURSELF. YOU'RE A SMART PERSON. SHOW ME HOW SMART YOU ARE. UH-OH. RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE. WHATEVER IT IS, IS IN THIS ROOM. - OKAY. - REUBEN, WE'RE FOLLOWING YOU INTO THIS ROOM, BUDDY. I'M SITTING HERE, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I FELT LIKE A... - MARCUS? - ...WIND GO BY MY HEAD. I FEEL YOU, BUT WE'RE -- IT WAS JUST BEHIND YOU. SO I FELT, LIKE, A GUST OF WIND GO BY MY HEAD LIKE THAT. AND... PHEW. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN THE BASEMENT, PLENTY OF CLAIMS. [ SIGHS ] [ BEEPING ] - THAT'S THE SHADOW DETECTOR. - THAT'S THE SHADOW DETECTOR. - HOLD ON A SECOND. - WHERE'S THAT AT? Dalen: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE WE ARE IN THIS BASEMENT. I FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON IN HERE, MAN. THIS JOINT HAS HAD SO MUCH ACTIVITY. Juwan: OOGLY, WHERE YOU GO? OOGLY RIGHT HERE, OOGLY'S RIGHT IN HERE, IN THE CORNER. WHERE? - RIGHT HERE IN THAT WATER. - OOGLY? YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO DRINK THAT, OOGLY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT WATER BEEN. [ OOGLY SCREECHES ] - OH! - AH! I FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON IN HERE, MAN. Marcus: THIS JOINT HAS HAD SO MUCH ACTIVITY. Marcus: OOGLY'S RIGHT HERE IN THE CORNER. - WHERE? - RIGHT HERE IN THAT WATER. Juwan: OOGLY? YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO DRINK THAT, OOGLY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT WATER BEEN. [ OOGLY SCREECHES ] - OH! - AH! - WHAT WAS THAT? - SOMETHING GRABBED OOGLY ASS. - OOGLY? - THAT WAS THE WATER! Juwan: THAT BAD BOY GOT OOGLY. Dalen: HEY, OOGLY, YOU WEREN'T THE ONLY ONE. I JUMPED A LITTLE BIT TOO, THOUGH. Marcus: HEY, MAN, EVERYBODY JUMPED WITH OOGLY, MAN. LOOK AT OOGLY, HE RIGHT THERE CHILLING. I THOUGHT OOGLY WAS A GONER. THIS IS THE OLD RULE -- IF ONE BLACK PERSON SCURRY, ALL OF THEM SCURRY. - OH! - AH! THAT WAS THE WATER! WE SAW OOGLY MAKE A MOVE, WE MADE A MOVE. LISTEN, OOGLY, WE GOT YOUR BACK. OOGLY, YOU BETTER COME ON UP THESE STAIRS. OOGLY, WE GOING BACK UP, BRO. SO WHILE DALEN AND JUWAN ARE INVESTIGATING ON THE SECOND LEVEL, I'M GOING TO BRING WENDY JESSIE, A LOCAL INVESTIGATOR WHO'S HAD EXPERIENCE AT THE THORNHAVEN MANOR. I THINK IT'S GONNA BE DOPE. Marcus: SO, WENDY, YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS PRETTY MUCH THE FLOOR THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN THE MOST ACTIVITY, CORRECT? YES, I GOT A ROCK THROWN IN FRONT OF MY FACE -A ROCK? ...RIGHT ON THOSE STAIRCASES OVER THERE. LET'S ROLL OVER THERE. Marcus: SO THE HOUSE REALLY RESPONDS TO A FEMALE PRESENCE. SO WE'RE GONNA BRING WENDY IN HERE TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME THINGS REALLY MOVING. SO YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS THE HALLWAY WHERE YOU HAD YOUR EXPERIENCE? TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. SO I ACTUALLY, I'D LEFT MY DIGITAL RECORDER DOWN IN THE HALL, HAD WALKED DOWN THESE STEPS AND WHEN I GOT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM, I HAD A ROCK JUST FLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY FACE. I MEAN, I RAN BACKWARDS. I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS ABLE TO DO THAT ON STAIRS... - WOW. - ...BUT I DID. SO I HAVE THIS SHADOW DETECTOR. PRETTY MUCH WHAT IT DOES IS JUST DETECT SHADOWS. I GOT THIS MOTION SENSOR. I'M GONNA SET IT UP IN HERE. - OKAY. AND MAYBE WE CAN SEE IF THERE'S ANY TYPE OF, LIKE, MOVEMENT COMING UP THE STAIRS. OKAY. - YOU RUN YOUR SESSION. - OKAY. I'M GONNA SET THIS UP DOWN THERE. - OKAY. - MAYBE THAT'LL KIND OF GET US SOME ACTIVITY. - ALL RIGHT. SO STAY RIGHT HERE ON THIS TOP STEP... YEAH. OR YOU WANT ME TO GO DOWN SOME?

WE NOT GONNA PRESS CHARGES OR ANYTHING. WE JUST WANT TO KIND OF SEE WHAT'S GOING ON, WHY. IS YOUR NAME FRANK THURMAN OR ARE YOU REUBEN BAILEY? ARE ANY OF THE BAILEYS HERE? DO YOU NOT LIKE VISITORS? IF SOMEONE'S HERE, WILL YOU WALK UP THESE STEPS TO ME? OR IF YOU'RE UPSTAIRS, YOU CAN WALK DOWN THE STAIRS TO ME. [ BEEPS ] THAT WAS THE SHADOW DETECTOR. - YEAH. OKAY, SO I HAVEN'T MOVED. WENDY, YOU HAVEN'T MOVED? - NO. WE JUST ASKED IF YOU WANT TO GO UP OR DOWN THE STAIRS, YOU CAN. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN... [ SIGHS ] THE SHADOW DETECTOR GOES OFF. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT ALL THIS -- [ BEEPS ] ...ANOTHER SHADOW RIGHT THERE. WENDY, YOU WANT TO KIND OF PLAY BACK SOME OF THAT SESSION? - YEP. - YEAH. ALL RIGHT. - HERE WE ARE. Marcus: DO YOU NOT LIKE VISITORS? [ INDISTINCT VOICE ] Wendy: "DO YOU NOT LIKE VISITORS," AND THEN IT SAYS SOMETHING. - REWIND THAT, OKAY. - LET ME SLOW IT DOWN. DO YOU NOT LIKE VISITORS? NO, I DON'T. - DID IT SAY, "I DON'T"? - IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE, "NO, I DO NOT" OR "NO, I DON'T" OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. Marcus: DO YOU NOT LIKE VISITORS? BUT WE UP IN HIS HOUSE. THEY GOT VISITORS.

WHILE MARCUS INVESTIGATES WITH WENDY, ME AND JUWAN, WE GONNA CHECK OUT THE SECOND FLOOR. THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF PEOPLE HEARING VOICES AND FOOTSTEPS HERE. INVESTIGATORS HAVE ALSO CAUGHT FOOTAGE OF AN APPARITION. OOGLY, IS THAT YOU? BRO, IS THAT OOGLY ON THE STAIRS? OH **** BRO. I NEED OOGLY TO START SPEAKING. LOOK AT THAT RIGHT THERE.

I thought that that might kind of maybe GET THE SPIRITS MOVING A LITTLE BIT UP THERE. Dalen: Yeah, it might not have been the spirits moving, BUT JUWAN BIG ASS SURE DID MOVE DOWN THEM STAIRS. [ LAUGHING ] Dalen: SO WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE THORNHAVEN MANOR IN NEW CASTLE, INDIANA. THIS PLACE HAS BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE A LOT OF PARANORMAL ACTIVITY AND MANY BELIEVE IT'S CONNECTED TO THE MURDER OF REUBEN BAILEY. SO FAR, THIS PLACE IS ACTIVE. ARE YOU REUBEN? YES, RIGHT THERE. EARLIER IN THE INVESTIGATION, WE HAD SOME REALLY SOLID ACTIVITY IN THE BASEMENT. SO JUWAN AND I ARE GONNA HEAD BACK INTO THE BASEMENT TO SEE IF WE CAN GET IN CONTACT WITH REUBEN BAILEY OR THE MAN THAT POISONED HIM, FRANK THURMAN.
