 DID HE JUST TAKE HIS SHIRT OFF? MAKE SURE YOU DON'T CATCH ANY SPIRITUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. I'M JUWAN AND I'M A GHOST BROTHER.

I HEAR THAT. - WHAT'S UP? - IT'S GOOD, BRO. UGH! BUSY DAY? BUSY DAY. YOU SEE IT'S POPPIN'. THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR, MAN. GUYS, I GOT A DOOZER FOR YOU GUYS THIS WEEK. Juwan: WHERE? OLD CITY JAIL IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA. OH, OKAY. I THINK Y'ALL MIGHT LIKE THIS STORY. Dalen: THE OLD CITY JAIL WAS BUILT IN 1802 AND HAD SOME OF THE WORST CRIMINALS IN CHARLESTON HOUSED HERE DURING ITS 137-YEAR HISTORY. AT THE OLD CITY JAIL, THEY SAID, LIKE, CONDITIONS WERE JUST HORRIBLE, BRO. WORD. LIKE FECES, RATS, LICE, AMONG THEM. - IT'S NOT THE LA QUINTA. - NO, IT'S NOT THE LA QUINTA. TWO OF THE MOST INFAMOUS INMATES WERE JOHN AND LAVINIA FISHER. ACCORDING TO LEGEND, IN THE EARLY 1800s, LAVINIA FISHER AND HER HUSBAND, JOHN, RAN AN INN, WHERE IT IS BELIEVED THEY WOULD MURDER THEIR GUESTS BY USING POISON. THEY WERE EVENTUALLY CAUGHT AND IMPRISONED IN THE OLD CITY JAIL. MAN, PEOPLE SAY THAT LAVINIA AND HER HUSBAND KILLED WELL OVER A HUNDRED PEOPLE, BRO. - GET OUT OF HERE! - A HUNDRED. A HUNDO? AND NOT ONLY THAT, AT THE OLD CITY JAIL, THEY SAY PROBABLY OVER 10,000 PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES THERE. WAIT. THEY SHOULD JUST HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF TEARS GOING ON THE FRONT -- ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THE JAIL? ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THE JAIL. JUST A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM. - THAT IS CRAZY. WHAT TYPE OF CLAIMS DO THEY HAVE AT THIS SPOT, MAN? EVERYTHING YOU COULD THINK OF, MAN. - APPARITIONS? - APPARITIONS. - SHADOW FOLK? - SHADOW FIGURES. - DISEMBODIED VOICES? - DISEMBODIED VOICES, YEAH. OH, YOU MUST HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE. Y'ALL WAS LOCKED UP THERE BEFORE? - MAN, NO. - MAN, NO. I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE LOCKUP. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO NOW. - GET TO IT? - GET TO CHARLESTON. GET TO CHARLESTON. ♪♪ BRO, THIS IS THE TRUE SOUTH. THEY SAY THIS IS, LIKE, ONE OF THE MOST HAUNTED PLACES IN THE COUNTRY. Juwan: IT LOOKS LIKE IT. Marcus: ONE OF THE FIRST STOPS THAT THEY USED TO HAVE ON -- WHEN THEY WERE BRINGING THE SLAVES OVER. - REALLY? - YEAH. WELL, IT'S BEAUTIFUL, THOUGH, MAN. YOU GOT THE WATER, YOU GOT BOATS. MAN, YOU GOT THE OLD-TIME HOUSES, MAN, WITH THE PORCHES ON THE FRONT. - THIS IS THE JAIL? - THIS IS IT. - OH, MY GOD. - WOW. THIS ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE A CASTLE? ♪♪ Dalen: SO, WE'RE HEADED TO MEET STEPHEN, WHO'S A TOUR GUIDE AT THE OLD CITY JAIL. HOPEFULLY, HE CAN SHOW US AROUND AND LET US KNOW SOME OF THE CLAIMS. WELL, WELCOME TO CHARLESTON. - MAN, THANKS. - APPRECIATE IT. WELCOME TO THE OLD JAIL. THE BUILDING HAS BEEN HERE SINCE 1802, AND IT WAS USED AS A JAIL UNTIL 1939. IT IS EASILY THE MOST HAUNTED BUILDING IN SOUTH CAROLINA. - EASILY? - EASILY. OH, YEAH, BY FAR. SIMPLY BECAUSE, I THINK, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED HERE. THE ESTIMATES ARE SOMEWHERE AROUND 10,000 PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED HERE -- MOST OF THEM FROM THE CONDITIONS. STEPHEN SAYS THERE WERE 20 TO 25 PRISONERS CRAMMED INTO ONE CELL AT A TIME. WITH NO INDOOR PLUMBING AND HAY SCATTERED ABOUT THE FLOOR, PRISONERS WERE SURROUNDED BY RATS, FLEAS, AND DISEASES. WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT A STORY ABOUT AMERICA'S, LIKE -- IT WAS THE FIRST FEMALE SERIAL KILLER. LAVINIA FISHER AND HER HUSBAND, JOHN. ACCOUNTS DIFFER ON WHAT THEY DID OR DIDN'T DO, BUT THEY WERE ACCUSED OF MURDER. WHILE THEY WERE GOING THROUGH THEIR TRIAL, THEY WERE BROUGHT HERE TO THE JAIL AND KEPT HERE. SO, WAS SHE HOUSED WITH HER HUSBAND, OR WAS SHE SEPARATE? LAVINIA WAS KEPT WITH HER HUSBAND IN A CELL ON A SECOND-FLOOR ROOM -- ACTUALLY, RIGHT ACROSS THE HALL FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW. IT IS BELIEVED, AT ONE POINT, THEY TRIED TO ESCAPE BY TYING BED SHEETS TOGETHER AND THROWING THEM OUT THE WINDOW. JOHN WENT OUT THE WINDOW FIRST, BUT THE BED SHEETS RIPPED. THE WINDOW WAS TOO HIGH FOR LAVINIA TO JUMP, AND SHE WAS LEFT BEHIND. TURNED HIMSELF IN THE NEXT DAY. HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE WITHOUT HIS WIFE. IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SIGHT TO SEE TO SEE THEM ON THEIR WAY TO THEIR DEATH. SHE HAD AN INTERESTING EXECUTION, TOO. WHILE MANY PRISONERS WERE EXECUTED WITHIN THESE WALLS, THE PEOPLE OF CHARLESTON DEMANDED A PUBLIC HANGING FOR JOHN AND LAVINIA. AND EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS SAY THERE WERE MAYBE 2,000 PEOPLE UP THERE WAITING FOR LAVINIA TO DIE. BUT LAVINIA, SHE LOOKS OUT OVER THE CROWD, AND SHE SAYS, "IF ANY OF YOU HAVE A MESSAGE FOR THE DEVIL, TELL ME NOW, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO SEE HIM." [ LAVINIA LAUGHS ] [ NECK SNAPS ] LAVINIA'S COME BACK HERE TO HAUNT THIS PLACE. LAVINIA'S PRETTY EASY TO PICK OUT WITH HER WHITE DRESS THAT SHE WAS EXECUTED IN. I'VE HAD A LOT OF EXPERIENCES WITH HER, I THINK. BUT I'VE SEEN HER ONCE. REALLY? ON THE PRISON'S SECOND FLOOR, OTHERS CLAIM TO HAVE SEEN LAVINIA'S APPARITION, HEARD HER VOICE, AND EVEN BEEN TOUCHED BY HER SPIRIT. Marcus: WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE THAT'S REALLY KEEPING THE SPIRITS HERE? I THINK THERE'S SOME SORT OF EMOTIONAL TRAUMA... MM. ...THAT GETS THAT ENERGY STUCK SOMEWHERE. AND THERE ARE ROOMS THAT ARE MORE ACTIVE. AND THEY SEEM TO BE THE UPPER FLOORS. THE UPPER FLOOR WAS ACTUALLY CALLED MT. RASCAL. THEY PUT THE MORE VIOLENT PRISONERS UP THERE, SO, OF COURSE, THE MORE VIOLENT THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN ON THOSE FLOORS WHERE THOSE PEOPLE WERE KEPT. - CAN WE SEE THAT? - SURE. YOU READY TO GO NOW? - ABSOLUTELY. LEAD THE WAY. - FOR SURE. COME ON. IT'S THIS WAY. ♪♪ Stephen: THIS IS THE ROOM WHERE THAT WOMAN GOT BIT AND WENT RUNNING ACROSS THE ROOM. SHE WAS OVER THERE WHEN SHE GOT BIT, AND RAN DIRECTLY ACROSS THE ROOM LIKE SHE WAS GONNA RUN OUT OF THAT WINDOW OVER THERE. SHE WOULD'VE BEEN IN THAT CORNER? YEAH, SHE WASN'T GONNA LEAVE? SHE WAS SO SCARED, SHE FORGOT WHERE THE DOOR WAS. I HAD A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY IN TEARS IN THIS ROOM ONE NIGHT. HIS MOTHER GOT MY ATTENTION, AND SHE SAID, "THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY SON." AND HE LOOKED AT ME, HE SAID, TEARS COMING OUT OF HIS EYES, HE SAID, "MY BACK IS ON FIRE." SO I SPUN HIM AROUND AND I PULLED HIS SHIRT UP AND SURE ENOUGH, HE HAD SCRATCH MARKS FROM HIS UPPER-RIGHT SHOULDER TO HIS LOWER-LEFT SIDE. MAN, STEVE, WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GIVING US A LOT OF HELPFUL INFORMATION. - YEAH, A LOT. IT'LL BE AN INTERESTING NIGHT. YEAH. Marcus: I DON'T LIKE WHEN PEOPLE SAY THAT WHEN THEY'RE SMILING LIKE THAT. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. HE'S ABOUT TO HIT YOU WITH A "WHOO-OO-HA." YEAH, I KNOW. IT'S LIKE, "OH, YES." SO, STEPHEN HAD A LOT OF CRAZY STORIES ABOUT THE PARANORMAL ACTIVITY THAT GOES ON AT THE OLD CITY JAIL. I MEAN, ON THE THIRD FLOOR ALONE, THAT'S WHERE ALL THE CRAZIES WERE HOUSED. AND THEN, ON THE SECOND FLOOR, YOU HAVE LAVINIA FISHER, WHO WAS THE FIRST FEMALE SERIAL KILLER. SO, OUR MISSION TONIGHT IS TO FIND OUT IF THERE ARE STILL SPIRITS IN THE OLD CITY JAIL, AND IF SO, WHO'S HERE AND WHAT'S KEEPING THEM TRAPPED WITHIN THESE WALLS. ♪♪ WELL, FELLAS... - YEAH. ...AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S NIGHTTIME. IT'S LOOKING A LITTLE STORMY OUT HERE, BRO. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT BAD WEATHER? GETS THAT ACTIVITY UP, MAN. SO, IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE A GOOD THING, RIGHT? - OH, YEAH, YEAH. - YEAH, WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS, THOUGH? WHAT TIME IS IT? TO POP THE TRUNK ON THESE GHOSTS. [ TRUNK CHIRPS ] OOH. - LET GO. - INDEED. TOO MUCH SAUCE. [ GRUNTS ] MAN, YOU BROUGHT US ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE CAR FOR ONE BAG? YEAH, BUT IT WAS DRAMATIC, THOUGH, RIGHT? IT WAS. OKAY. WE ARE IN THE JETS. MAN, I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD OPEN UP EVERY CELL DOOR. YOU KNOW, GIVE THEM A SENSE OF A PARDON. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE I WAS THINKING? WE SHOULD MAKE MARCUS GO OPEN UP EVERY CELL DOOR BY HIMSELF. WHA--? Marcus: I'M THE ONE IN THE UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION EVERY TIME. JUWAN AND I ARE GONNA WATCH IT FROM THE SPOT, JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S COOL. - HEAVY? - YEAH, CHECK. OKAY, I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING IN THIS HALLWAY, DAWG. MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE THOUGHT THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT BETTER. I NEED A LIGHT, AT LEAST, TO SEE THE DOOR HANDLE, RIGHT? JUST PULL THE LATCH. BRO, JUST PULL THE LATCH. Use your hand. See with your hand. All right, Marcus, I can see you. Look. ALL RIGHT, YOUR HAND, RIGHT NOW, IS ON THE KNOB. PULL THAT. NO, NOT THAT. IT'S A -- IT'S A LATCH YOU GOT TO LIFT UP. YOU GOT TO LIFT THE LATCH UP AND THEN SLIDE. GO TO THE RIGHT. JUWAN, YOU DO REALIZE HE CAN'T HEAR YOU UNLESS I PRESS THIS BUTTON? THAT'S WHAT I SAID. TELL HIM. BUT WHILE HE'S TALKING, YOU CAN'T TALK. I DON'T SEE NOTHING. WHY? 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE? - Dawg, can I get a light, bro? - NO, BECAUSE HE CAN'T HEAR YOU. CAN YOU SEE IN HERE? I MEAN, LIKE, REALLY. WOW. ...THAT YOU'RE TALKING AND I DON'T HAVE THE BUTTON PRESSED, 'CAUSE I CAN'T HEAR HIM UNLESS I PRESS THE BUTTON. - HEY. - I APOLOGIZE. I'M JUST TRYING TO SCHOOL JUWAN ON PROPER WALKIE ETIQUETTE. OH, HE GOT IT OPEN. CONGRATULATIONS, BROTHER. I see you got the first one open. ALL RIGHT, NOW. LISTEN, EVERYBODY, I'M LETTING Y'ALL OUT.

BRO, BUT THE WIND'S NOT BLOWING HARD ENOUGH TO MOVE THAT WINDOW. THAT'S WHAT -- NO, I'M SAYING, IT'S -- THE WIND WOULD BLOW IT OPEN. SOMEBODY SLAMMED IT SHUT. BRO, WHEN WE FIRST WALKED INTO THE ROOM, THE WINDOW WAS OPEN. Dalen: AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, ONE OF THE WINDOW PANES SLAMMED SHUT ON ITS OWN. [ BANG ] **** WHAT WAS THAT?

IF GANGSTA BOO FEELS THE PRESENCE OF A SPIRIT, HIS ARMS WILL LIGHT UP AND HOMEBOY'LL START TALKING. WE HAVE TWO VERSIONS OF THE REM-POD SET UP RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE ONE ON THE FAR CORNER WITH THE WINDOW, AND WE HAVE THE TEDDY BEAR REM-POD UP AGAINST THE WINDOW THERE. SO, I SAY WE ASK A FEW QUESTIONS, MAN. CLEARLY, THERE'S SOMETHING IN HERE.

THIS IS WHERE LAVINIA WAS HOUSED WITH HER HUSBAND, JOHN. SINCE WE HAD SO MUCH ACTIVITY CENTERED AROUND LAVINIA, WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON THIS ROOM AND SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN GET. AS YOU WALK IN, YOU FEEL, LIKE, A DEPTH IN THIS ROOM. THIS WAS THE CELL THAT LAVINIA STAYED IN, RIGHT OVER HERE. I FEEL, LIKE, PRESSURE, LIKE, RIGHT HERE, BRO, RUNNING DOWN, LIKE, MY TEMPLES. CAN YOU GET IN HERE? I CAN'T. MAYBE YOU CAN. THE WAY MY BODY IS SET UP, I CAN'T FIT IN THERE. THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENS. OH, BRO. YOU CAN FEEL IT IN HERE, MAN. YOU CAN FEEL, LIKE, HOW TIGHT IT IS IN HERE. I'M ONE PERSON IN HERE. I CAN'T FATHOM BEING IN HERE WITH 25 OTHER PEOPLE, USING THE RESTROOM, SICK, COUGHING, THROWING UP. OH, IT'S SOMETHING, FOR SURE, OVER HERE. [ REM-POD CHIRPING ] [ CELL DOOR CREAKS, CLOSES ] IS THERE ANYONE IN HERE WITH US? IS THERE ANYONE IN THIS CAGE THAT WANTS TO GET OUT? I HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING IN HERE. WELL, I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT, MARCUS. WE OPENED UP EVERY CELL DOOR IN HERE, AND WE TOLD THEM THEY'RE FREE TO WALK AROUND. YOU -- LIKE, YOU THINK THEY STILL IN HERE? THEY MIGHT HAVE MOVED ABOUT TO GET -- MOVE THEIR LEGS AROUND A LITTLE BIT. STRETCHED OUT A LITTLE BIT? JUWAN: Yo, fellas? OH. JUWAN, WHAT'S UP, BRO? OH, MAN, JUST FINISHING UP DOWN HERE IN THIS BASEMENT HALLWAY, BRO. HOW Y'ALL DOING UP THERE? MAN, WE GOT A LOT OF ACTIVITY WITH THE SHADOW DETECTOR IN THE HALLWAY. But we didn't get much in Lavinia's cell. UH, HOW ABOUT WE JUST ALL MEET ON THE SECOND FLOOR? COOL. OVER AND OUT. Dalen: LOOK, WE'RE NOT GIVING UP ON LAVINIA JUST YET. SO JUWAN IS GONNA JOIN US IN HER ROOM, AND WE'RE GONNA USE SOME TRIGGER OBJECTS. WE'RE GONNA USE SOME TEA AND WE'RE GONNA USE SOME BED SHEETS. 'CAUSE THE LEGEND HAS IT LAVINIA AND HER HUSBAND TRIED TO TIE BED SHEETS TOGETHER TO ESCAPE THE JAIL. WHAT THREAD COUNT IS THIS? OH, YOU KNOW THAT'S -- THAT'S... IT'S 300 THREAD COUNT. I DIDN'T HAVE A LOT LEFT IN THE BUDGET. OKAY. THIS IS ACTUALLY A TIME FOR JUWAN TO SHINE. WHAT'S THAT? WITH THE KNOTS. WEREN'T YOU A BOY SCOUT? - I'M AN EAGLE SCOUT. - OH, EXCUSE ME. EAGLE SCOUT. - OH. "I'M AN EAGLE SCOUT." - YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SO, WHAT TYPE OF KNOT CAN WE DO TO SECURE THESE SHEETS? YOU USE A SQUARE KNOT. IS A SQUARE KNOT GONNA BE ABLE TO HOLD A GROWN MAN AND A GROWN WOMAN ATTEMPTING TO SHIMMY DOWN A THIRD-FLOOR WINDOW? IF THEY TIED A SQUARE KNOT CORRECTLY, IT SHOULD. - OKAY. - A SQUARE KNOT. SO, WHEN YOU KNOW YOU GOT A SQUARE KNOT, 'CAUSE YOU CAN PULL BOTH ENDS AND IT GETS TIGHTER LIKE THAT. GOT ME A NICE KNOT. [ CHUCKLES ] [ REM-POD CHIRPS ] AS SOON AS I SAID, "GOT ME A NICE KNOT," THE REM-POD GOES CRAZY. I THINK THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TRIGGER OBJECT. Juwan: YOU GUYS GOT TO GO LIKE THIS. Dalen: JUWAN IS GONNA TRY AND CLIMB THE BED-SHEET ROPE, JUST TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME TYPE OF REACTION FROM EITHER LAVINIA OR HER HUSBAND. SO, I'M GONNA GO OUTSIDE. COOL. SEE IF YOU CAN CLIMB UP. - CHILLING BREEZE, BRO. - OOH! FEELS GOOD, THOUGH. THEY WANT ME TO CLIMB BACK IN TO JAIL ON SOME BED SHEETS. THAT'S COMPLETELY BACKWARDS FROM WHAT PEOPLE NORMALLY DO. LAVINIA, WE PRETTY MUCH JUST SET UP HOW YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND TRIED TO ESCAPE. [ REM-POD CHIRPS ] - YO. - OH, MAN. AS SOON AS YOU SAID "LAVINIA" IN HER ROOM, THE LIGHTS -- HEY, GUYS. WHAT'S UP? - ALL RIGHT. - SEE IF YOU CAN CLIMB UP. TRY TO SEE IF YOU CAN, LIKE -- IF IT'S STRONG ENOUGH. I'M GONNA HOLD THE CAGE, BRO. [ CHIRPING CONTINUES ] SO, THE POD IS GOING CRAZY. LIV IS GOING CRAZY. LIV, DOES THIS BRING BACK MEMORIES TO YOU? - HEY, GUYS. - YEAH. THIS ABOUT AS HIGH AS WE'RE GETTING, GUYS. IS HE UP HERE? DID HE MAKE IT UP FAIRLY HIGH? OH, YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU A HIGH FIVE? [ GRUNTS ] HE'S HIGH-FIVING ME. LIV, DOES THIS BRING BACK ANY MEMORIES TO YOU OR YOUR HUSBAND? [ REM-POD CHIRPS ] WOW! LIV, DOES THIS BRING BACK ANY MEMORIES TO YOU OR YOUR HUSBAND? [ REM-POD CHIRPS ] WOW! Marcus: DID YOU FEEL ALONE WHEN YOUR HUSBAND ESCAPED AND YOU DIDN'T? WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN UPSET IF YOUR HUSBAND WOULD HAVE LEFT YOU? HEY, DALEN, LET'S TRY THE TEA. Juwan: THAT WAS A MEAN, LITTLE WORKOUT. YOU REMEMBER, LIKE, IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN YOU HAD TO, LIKE, TRY AND CLIMB THE ROPE IN GYM CLASS? AND HAD TO SHIMMY YOUR WAY ALL THE WAY UP TO THE TOP? AND THEN YOU GET TO THE TOP AND FEEL DUMB BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY DOWN BUT TO SLIDE BACK DOWN THAT COARSE-ASS FIBER? THAT WAS, LIKE, ALL SHOULDERS AND BACK. ♪♪ Dalen: YOU KNOW, THE LEGEND HAS IT THAT SHE USED TEA TO POISON ALL OF HER VICTIMS. SO, THE PLAN IS TO USE THESE OBJECTS AS TRIGGER OBJECTS TO GET IN CONTACT WITH LIV. AND LET'S JUST SEE IF THAT STIRS UP SOME DRAMA. AS I'M POURING THE TEA, YOU GUYS CAN SEE... [ REM-POD CHIRPING ] THE TEA. LIV, WOULD YOU LIKE A BIT OF TEA? [ CHIRPING CONTINUES ] OKAY, SEE? LOOKS LIKE YOU CAN HAVE YOU GUYS A LITTLE TEA PARTY. I'M JUST GONNA MIND MY OWN BUSINESS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE US DRINK THE TEA? [ CHIRPING STOPS ] ARE YOU STILL HERE? IS YOUR HUSBAND STILL HERE? IS ANYONE IN HERE WITH US? IT WENT FROM NONSTOP QUESTIONING AND ANSWERING ON THE REM-POD TO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I MEAN, IT SEEMS LIKE WHOEVER WAS TALKING TO US, THEY MUST HAVE LEFT. HOW ABOUT WE LOCK YOU BACK IN? [ CELL DOOR CREAKS, CLOSES ] ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LET'S GO AHEAD AND BRING IT ON IN, MAN. I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME TO WRAP UP THIS INVESTIGATION. YEAH, IT SEEMED LIKE WE HAD A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN HERE, BRO. A WHOLE BUNCH OF ACTIVITY, MAN. THIS JAIL IS JAM-PACKED. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT, BRO. I THINK THE CRAZIEST THING, FOR ME, TONIGHT IS SEEING THAT FULL-BODY SHADOW FIGURE WALK PAST THAT DOOR. BRO, DID YOU SEE THAT? IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY'S FOOT, LEG, BODY. HOLD ON. REWIND IT. WE DIDN'T REALLY GET TOO MANY, LIKE, VOCAL RESPONSES. ALL OF OUR STUFF WAS DONE BY ACTIONS. YOU KNOW WHAT'S CRAZY? I KNOW WE DON'T LIKE TO USE AGGRESSION AND WE PREFER HUMOR OVER AGGRESSION, AND THE ONLY TIME THAT WE PULL OUT AGGRESSIVE MEASURES IS WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE THAT LIVED AN AGGRESSIVE LIFE. MM-HMM. SO, FOR US TO BE AGGRESSIVE UP THERE WITH THE RAPISTS AND THE MURDERERS ON THE THIRD FLOOR, MAN, AND TO GET THAT TYPE OF CRAZY FEEDBACK... [ REM-POD CHIRPS ] YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF SICK PERSON YOU GOT TO BE TO ONLY WANT TO HARM WOMEN AND CHILDREN? [ CREAK, BANG ] - WHOA! - COME ON, MAN. [ LOUD BANGING ] BRO, I SAT THERE AND WATCHED THE SHUTTER CLOSE. WE DEFINITELY GOT A LOT OF ACTIVITY FROM LAVINIA, EVEN IN THE SECOND FLOOR, WHEN WE WERE IN THE HALLWAY AND THE SHADOW DETECTOR STARTED GOING CRAZY. WERE YOU HANGED OUTSIDE -- [ SHADOW DETECTOR BEEPS ] OH **** HEY, MAN, I CAN HONESTLY SAY, MAN, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH OUR WORK HERE TONIGHT. ANOTHER JOB WELL DONE. BROTHER. IT'S IN THERE, BRUH. THIS SPOT ALMOST GOT ME, MAN. I FELT LIKE A PUNK ON SOME OF THEM OCCASIONS. AFTER ALL THE ACTIVITY WE'VE EXPERIENCED TONIGHT IN THIS JAIL, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THIS PLACE IS FOR SURE HAUNTED. I MEAN, IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE THE CRAZY CRIMINALS ON THE THIRD FLOOR, AND YOU GOT THE RESPONSES FROM LAVINIA ON THE SECOND FLOOR. SO, I KNOW FOR SURE SHE HAS TO STILL BE HERE. SO, UNTIL NEXT TIME, "GHOST BROTHERS" GHOSTING OUT. ♪♪ - SAY, FELLAS. - WHAT'S UP? YOU THINK THE OLD CITY JAIL IS HAUNTED? - "DO YOU THINK IT'S HAUNTED?" - BRO, IT IS CERTIFIED, "GHOST BROTHERS" STAMPED AND APPROVED -- HAUNTED, BRUH. I THINK WE SHOULD LEAVE. IT'S TIME TO GO. I DON'T WANT TO HANG AROUND HERE ANYMORE. FOR SURE. LET'S ROLL UP OUT OF HERE. - HEY, MAN, I'M PROUD OF US, MAN. - GOOD JOB, GUYS. A FULL-BODY APPARITION, MAN? GOT ME THINKING -- YOU'D BETTER GET IN THIS CAR BEFORE YOU'RE LEFT AT THIS JAIL. ♪♪ ♪ "GHOST BROTHERS" GHOSTING OUT ♪
