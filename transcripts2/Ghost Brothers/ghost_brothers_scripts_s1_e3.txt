THIS PLACE WAS ACTUALLY A STOP ON THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. - SHUT UP. - YEAH. I SWEAR. BUT THEY SAY IT'S HAUNTED. PROSPECT PLACE WAS BUILT BY AN ABOLITIONIST IN 1856 AS A PLACE RUNAWAY SLAVES COULD SEEK SHELTER. BUT THE CRAZIEST THING ABOUT THIS PROPERTY IS THE LEGEND OF THE HANGING. IN THE LATE 1850s, A BOUNTY HUNTER CAME TO THE HOUSE LOOKING FOR RUNAWAY SLAVES TO CAPTURE AND RETURN FOR MONEY. BUT WORKERS ON THE PROPERTY CAPTURED HIM INSTEAD. AND THEY HANGED HIM IN THE BARN. PEOPLE BELIEVE HE'S STILL IN THAT BARN, PISSED OFF AND HAUNTING IT TO THIS DAY. WORD. BRO, IT'S, LIKE, THE WHOLE GAMUT OF, LIKE, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY JUST RUNNIN' THROUGH THIS PLACE. HMM. YOU HEAR VOICES, FOOTSTEPS. YOU HAVE LITERALLY, LIKE, FULL-BODIED APPARITIONS. WHAT'S CRAZY IS I READ ABOUT THIS LADY NAMED KIM. SHE WAS INVESTIGATING THE PROPERTY IN THE BARN... - WORD. - WHERE SOMETHING PHYSICALLY, LIKE, TOUCHED HER. AND SHE GOT PICTURES TO PROVE. - STOP LYIN'. - NA, MAN. I'M JUST GONNA HIT HER UP, BRO, CALL HER. [ RINGING ] DON'T YOU HATE WHEN BARBERS DO THAT? - MM-HMM. - THEY JUST KEEP SWIPIN'. BUT THEY DON'T GET NONE OF THE HAIR ON YOUR NOSE. HEY, KIM. THIS IS DALEN. HOW ARE YOU? I'M WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL. WE HEARD THAT SOMETHING PRETTY INTERESTIN' HAPPENED TO YOU IN THE BARN AT PROSPECT PLACE. IS THAT TRUE? ARE YOU SERIOUS? THE THINGS THAT YOU TOLD US SOUND AMAZING. LET ME ASK YOU THIS. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO MEET US OUT THERE AND MAYBE SHOW US WHERE THIS HAPPENED? AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN FIND OUT SOME STUFF. ALL RIGHT, KIM. FELLAS, WHAT Y'ALL THINK ABOUT THAT, MAN? WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO FIND OUT WHO SCRATCHED KIM. MAN, IT'S KINDA COOL THOUGH, MAN. LIKE, THESE SPIRITS ARE VIOLENT. - THAT'S COOL TO YOU? - I MEAN... THAT'S COOL TO YOU? THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT FUN. NO. AND IT'S DOPE THAT IT'S PART OF THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. YEAH. THAT'S COOL. Y'ALL DOWN? Y'ALL WITH IT? HEY, BRUH. I'M WITH IT, DAWG. GOTTA GET THE BERRIES AND JUICES IN JUWAN'S HAIR. MM. LET'S GO. TIME TO START GHOSTIN'. ♪♪ SAY, NOW, TELL ME THIS AIN'T CRAZY. WE NEED TO MAKE A LEFT ONTO LOUIS DRIVE. BUT THAT IS HIGHWAY 666. OH! OKAY. WE'LL GO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. IS IT REALLY HIGHWAY 666? IS THIS THE HIGHWAY TO HELL? BRO, THIS IS, LIKE, A OLD, ONE-STREET TOWN. YEAH. THIS IS CRAZY. - I DON'T SEE NO BLACK FOLK... - I WONDER IF IT'S... EXCEPT FOR SERENA WILLIAMS ON THAT POSTER. I WONDER IF THIS TOWN HAS, LIKE, PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. IT LOOK LIKE IT. I KNOW A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE DONE DIED IN THIS ****. WELL, MOST PEOPLE DIE IN... - EVERYWHERE. - WHERE THEY LIVE. YEAH. YEAH. YEP, PRETTY MUCH. SO LOOK. KIM FEELS LIKE SHE WAS SCRATCHED BY SOMETHING. - I WANNA SEE IT WITH MY OWN EYES. - RIGHT. IF SHE DID GET SCRATCHED BY A GHOST, WHAT KINDA GHOST ARE YOU, HOMEY? AND WHY ARE YOU SCRATCHIN' WOMEN? WHY IS YOU SCRATCHIN' WOMEN? YOU KNOW, IT'S TIME FOR US TO GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF IT, MAN. ♪♪ BRUH. LOOK AT THIS, BRO! LOOK HOW BIG THAT HOUSE IS, DAWG. YOU KNOW WE GONNA HAVE TO SPLIT UP IN THIS ****. - SPLIT UP? - EXCUSE ME? HOLD ON A SECOND. DID YOU SAY, "SPLIT UP?" - I'LL STOP THIS THING. - BRO, WHAT I'M SAYIN'... LOOK HOW BIG THE HOUSE IS! HELL NAW! YOU CAN TELL ME THERE AIN'T NO BODIES BURIED OUT HERE, MAN. YOU WANNA GO TALK TO GEORGE, THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE? [ DOOR KNOCKER TAPPING ] HEY, GEORGE! - GEORGE! - NICE TO MEET; DALEN. NICE TO MEET YOU. GEORGE, WHAT'S GOIN' ON? GEORGE ADAMS IS THE GREAT-GREAT-GRANDSON OF GEORGE W. ADAMS, A BUSINESSMAN WHO BUILT PROSPECT PLACE WAY BACK IN 1856. NOW THIS BIG, CREEPY MANSION IS GEORGE'S BACHELOR PAD. George: MY GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHER, GEORGE WILLISON ADAMS, - WAS AN ABOLITIONIST. - OKAY. UNIQUELY, THIS HOUSE WAS BUILT WITH THAT IN MIND. THEY ACTUALLY SET ASIDE TWO ROOMS IN THE BASEMENT THAT WOULD SERVE AS THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD REFUGEE CENTER. THEY WOULD HAVE A PERSON STATIONED IN THE WATCHTOWER AT THE TOP OF THE BUILDING. IF BOUNTY HUNTER ACTIVITY WAS PRETTY, YOU KNOW, HIGH IN THE AREA, THE CUPOLA WOULD BE DARK. IF IT WAS SAFE, THEY WOULD LIGHT A LANTERN, SET THAT IN THE CUPOLA. AND THAT WAS THE LIGHT OF FREEDOM. YOU COME ACROSS THE FIELD, UH, FROM THE RIVER. AND YOU COME UP INTO THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY, DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT. THEY WOULD COME IN. AND GEORGE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE HIS CONDUCTOR TAKE A BOARD OR SOMETHING AND KNOCK ON THE FLOOR OF HIS BEDROOM, WHICH WAS RIGHT ABOVE, LET HIM KNOW. AND HE WOULD COME DOWN FROM UPSTAIRS. - NICE. - THAT'S COOL, MAN. CAN YOU POSSIBLY FILL US IN ON THE BARN? George: THERE IS AN ORAL HISTORY WITHIN THE FAMILY THAT TALKS ABOUT THE VISIT OF A BOUNTY HUNTER, CAME TO THE FRONT DOOR AND TOLD GEORGE THAT, "I KNOW YOU HAVE SLAVES IN THERE. TURN 'EM OVER. I WANT 'EM." AND GEORGE PULLED HIS NAVY REVOLVER OUT. AND HE AND THE BOUNTY HUNTER HAD A STANDOFF FOR A LITTLE WHILE HERE AT THE FRONT DOOR. A BUNCH OF THE RANCH HANDS WORKING IN THE BARN CAME RUNNING OUT WITH THEIR RIFLES. AND SUDDENLY, THE BOUNTY HUNTER RODE OFF. HISTORICALLY ACCURATE... WE KNOW THERE WAS AN INCIDENT. BEYOND THAT, YOU HAVE LEGEND. MM. - OKAY. - SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID THAT THERE WAS MORE TO IT THAN THAT. SO OUR WITNESS, KIM, AND HER DAUGHTER, JOY, THEY'RE JUST TWO OF THE MANY PEOPLE THAT REALLY BELIEVE THE LEGEND. LADIES, HOW ARE YOU? GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? FINE. HOW ARE YOU? THEY SAY THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO THE CLAIM OF THE BOUNTY HUNTER. THE LEGEND IS -- IS THAT SOME OF THE RANCH HANDS LATER ON FOLLOWED THE BOUNTY HUNTER, BROUGHT HIM BACK TO THE BARN, HAD A MOCK TRIAL, FOUND HIM GUILTY AND HUNG HIM FROM THE RAFTERS UP HERE, HAD HIS BODY DROPPED DOWN THROUGH THE HOLE. - REALLY? - UM, YEAH. WHOA. AND THEN FURTHER ON IN THE LEGEND, IT SAYS THAT AFTER THEY CUT HIM DOWN, THAT THEY BURIED HIM SOMEWHERE ON THE PROPERTY, JUST BURIED HIM RIGHT HERE. YOU THINK THERE ACTUALLY MIGHT BE A BODY BURIED HERE? I THINK THERE'S A VERY STRONG POSSIBILITY. COOL. I'M GONNA GET A CADAVER DOG DOWN HERE TO SEE IF MAYBE A BODY'S BURIED IN THE BARN. THAT COULD BE THE SOURCE OF THE PARANORMAL CLAIMS THAT KIM'S TELLIN' US ABOUT. SO I WAS JUST TAKEN PICTURES WITH MY DIGITAL CAMERA, USING FLASHES. AND I TAKE A LOT OF PICTURES. AND THE SPIRIT IN THE BARN DOESN'T LIKE FLASH. I WENT. AND I SAT DOWN ON THE BENCH. AND I WAS LOOKIN' THROUGH THE CAMERA TO SEE IF I HAD CAUGHTEN ANY PICTURES. WELL, WHEN I DID, I FELT THIS BURNING SENSATION ON THE LOWER PART OF MY NECK - AND MY UPPER BACK. - MM. AND IT WAS REALLY STARTIN' TO BURN PRETTY BAD. AND THEN ABOUT 2 MINUTES LATER WAS WHEN I GOT SCRATCHED ON THE TOP OF THE BACK. WE WERE LISTENING TO THE RECORDINGS. AND AT THE END OF ONE RECORDING, IT SAID, "I'LL CUT YOU." - WHAT? - YEAH. WE GOT A VOICE SAID, "I'LL CUT YOU." I JUST GOT A CHILL FROM THAT, GUYS. I AIN'T TRYIN' TO BE... WHY WOULD YOU SAY, "I'LL CUT YOU?" THAT'S LIKE SOME, UH... 1970s PIMP STUFF, LIKE... YEAH. "I WILL STICK YOU, BROTHER. PIMPIN', DON'T EVER COME INTO MY BARN WITHOUT KNOWIN' THE THINGS THAT I DO. I WILL CUT YOU." THAT'S RIGHT. YOU GOT A STRAIGHT RAZOR? I WILL CUT YOU. DANG. THAT'S INTERESTING. TELL ME IF YOU FEEL, LIKE, MAYBE US BEING HERE TONIGHT, THAT COULD MAYBE PROVOKE THE BOUNTY HUNTER BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST, LIKE... IT'S BECAUSE THAT I CAME HERE LOOKIN' FOR BLACK FOLKS, - THAT I GOT HUNG. - IT'S POSSIBLE. - IS THAT POSSIBLE? - VERY POSSIBLE. - YEAH. - I WOULD SAY YES. IF THE BOUNTY HUNTER IS BURIED HERE AND IS THE SOURCE OF THOSE CLAIMS, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN LOCATE HIM WITH THE HELP OF A CADAVER DOG. AND IF HE'S HERE, I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY TO SEE US. - Y'ALL WANNA MAKE A BET? - YEAH. - WHAT? - WHAT'S THAT BET? WHAT TYPE OF DOG IT'S GONNA BE. - AW, MAN. - I'M IN. I'M GOING GERMAN SHEPHERD. I THINK I'M GONNA GO SOME TYPE OF HOUND. SHE GONNA BRING A CUJO. THE HELL IS A CUJO? - CUJO? - YOU KNOW WHAT A CUJO... YOU DO KNOW CUJO IS THE NAME OF A DOG AND NOT A BREED? NO. - OKAY. - YOU DON'T KNOW. BUT YOU KNOW CUJO WHEN YOU SEE CUJO? BUT, UH -- UH, YOU -- YOU SAY, "CUJO" IF YOU SEE THAT DOG OVER HERE. EXACTLY. YEAH. OKAY. MOMENT OF TRUTH. MOMENT OF TRUTH. - YEAH. THAT'S A A CUJO. - THAT'S A YELLOW LAB. OH. I CAME THE CLOSEST. UH! WHOA! WHOA! WE GOIN' FOR THE MOUTH, STRAIGHT FOR THE MOUTH. - LET'S GET TO WORK. - ABSOLUTELY. - HECK YEAH. - FOR SURE. BECAUSE I'M A GHOST BROTHER. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. - ALL RIGHT. - GO, LACHLY! SO HOW DOES LACHLAN NOTIFY US THAT HE HAS PICKED UP A SCENT? REALLY? RIGHT. UH-OH. HE'S HEADED RIGHT TO THE SOURCE. Hope: IS HE ABLE TO GET IN THIS BEHIND HERE? IS THERE A REASON WHY HE'S TRYIN' TO GET BACK THERE, YOU THINK? YEAH. HE MIGHT. LACH. LACHLAN. COME HERE, BUDDY. THERE IT IS. YOU WANNA GET BACK THERE? Woman: SO HE'S IN. AND HE'S SCANNING AROUND, CHECKIN' ALL THE AREAS, TRYIN' TO CLEAR THINGS OUT. Man: HE SEEMS REALLY INTERESTED IN THAT AREA. Woman: HE DOES. Man: WHAT YOU SEE, BUDDY? SAY, BRUH. HE BACK HERE DIGGIN'. IS HE? YEAH. YOU SEE THAT BIG HOLE THAT HE'S, LIKE, REALLY INTERESTED IN? HE'S GOIN'. AND HE SMELLS SOMETHING. Hope: HE'S TRAINED TO TELL US WHEN HE FINDS HUMAN SCENT. - [ BARKING ] - UH-OH. [ LACHLAN BARKING ] HE'S HEADED RIGHT TO THE SOURCE. RIGHT NOW, WE'VE GOT A CADAVER DOG LOOKIN' FOR THE REMAINS OF THE BOUNTY HUNTER WHO WITNESSES SAY LURKS IN THE BARN, SCRATCHING WOMEN. SAY, BRUH. HE BACK HERE DIGGIN'. AND HE SMELLS SOMETHING. Hope: HE'S TRAINED TO TELL US WHEN HE FINDS HUMAN SCENT. [ BARKING ] UH-OH. HE WENT BERSERK. I'M TALKING ABOUT HE GAVE US RANGES OF EMOTION FROM EXCITING TO AGGRESSION TO, LIKE, HE ACTUALLY GOT SCARED. IS HE GROWLIN'? ALL RIGHT. LACHLAN, YOU OKAY, BUDDY? THAT HOLE RIGHT THERE, MAN, I THINK THAT MIGHT BE TO THE NEXT SIDE. HE'S OVER HERE NOW... TRYING TO GET TO THIS SAME HOLE. GET TO THAT SAME HOLE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, BRO, IF YOU WAS TO HIDE A DEAD BODY IN HERE, MAN, WHERE WOULD YOU PUT IT? OFF IN THE CUT, RIGHT? IT HAS TO BE OFF IN THE CUT. [ LACHLAN BARKS ] IS HE TRYIN' TO TELL YOU SOMETHING? YEAH. THIS -- THIS IS THE AREA HE'S INTERESTED IN. YEAH. LET'S STEP -- LET'S STEP OUT FOR A SECOND, GUYS. LACHLAN, MAN, YOU'RE AMAZING, BUDDY. YOU GOT A TREAT OR SOMETHING I CAN GIVE? - OKAY. ALL RIGHT. - OKAY. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. Y'ALL COVER YOUR EYES, HE DOIN' HIS BUSINESS. SO WITH THE TYPE OF ACTIVITY THAT LACHLAN SHOWED INSIDE OF THE BARN, DO YOU GUYS FEEL LIKE IT COULD VERY WELL BE A BODY IN THERE? YES. THIS IS TYPICAL BEHAVIOR WHEN HE'S LOCATED THE SOURCE OF WHAT HE'S TO FIND. WOW! OKAY. EVERYTHING WAS PRETTY MUCH IN THE AIR BEFORE LACHLAN GOT HERE. NOW, WITH THE ENERGY THAT LACHLAN SHOWED US IN THE BARN, IT MIGHT HAVE GENUINELY BEEN THE REMAINS OF THE BOUNTY HUNTER. LADIES, THANK YOU, GUYS, SO VERY MUCH. OH. YOU'RE MOST WELCOME. WITHOUT A QUESTION IN MY MIND, THE BARN IS DEFINITELY A HOT SPOT. BUT THIS PROPERTY'S CONNECTION TO THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD DOESN'T JUST END WITH THE BOUNTY HUNTER IN THE BARN. BACK IN THE DAY, THE BASEMENT WAS USED TO HIDE SLAVES ALONG THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. AND IT'S BELIEVED THAT SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY DIED HERE. WE DO HAVE A REPORT OF A SLAVE WOMAN WITH A HEAD INJURY THAT'S SEEN A LOT DOWN HERE. WE'VE ASKED VERONICA, A VOLUNTEER AT THE PROPERTY WHO'S FAMILIAR WITH VISITORS' PARANORMAL CLAIMS, TO SHARE WITH US WHAT SHE'S HEARD OVER THE YEARS. Veronica: IF YOU'RE DOWN HERE IN THE DARK, A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD SEE LIGHTS GOING BACK IN FORTH OR SHADOWS MOVING ON THE WALL AND RED GLOWING EYES IN THIS DOORWAY. WOW. Dalen: IN ADDITION TO THE CLAIMS IN THE BARN AND IN THE BASEMENT, THERE ARE ALSO REPORTS OF ACTIVITY IN THE HOUSE CENTERED AROUND A YOUNG GIRL BELIEVED TO HAVE DIED ON THE PROPERTY. WATCH THAT FIRST STEP. - IT'S A DOOZY. - IT'S A DOOZY. YES. WAIT. WAIT. THERE'S JUST A RANDOM DOOR THAT LEADS WHERE? THERE IS NOW. NOW THERE WAS ORIGINALLY A PORTICO. AND IT FORMED THE BALCONY FOR THIS DOOR. - OH. OKAY. - AND THE LEGEND WAS THAT THERE WAS A -- A YOUNG GIRL. AND IT WAS WINTERTIME. SHE WAS DELIRIOUS WITH FEVER. SHE WENT OUT ON THE BALCONY, SLIPPED ON THE ICE AND FELL OVER THE RAILING TO HER DEATH. [ SCREAMING ] THAT STORY HAS BEEN AROUND FOR GENERATIONS. AND MANY PEOPLE CLAIM TO SEE THE GIRL. AND SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE IN A WHITE GOWN. AND WE'LL GO IN HERE NEXT. DO Y'ALL FEEL A CERTAIN TYPE OF WAY OR IS IT JUST ME? I DO, BROTHER. - I DO. - YOU ALL RIGHT, BRO? BRO, I JUST DON'T FEEL GOOD, BRO. EVERYTHING FEELS DRAINED. I HAVE, LIKE, A SLIGHT HEADACHE, BRO. MY ENERGY FEELS DRAINED. Veronica: A LOT OF PEOPLE CLAIMED TO FEEL A HEAVINESS ON THEIR CHEST IN THIS ROOM. LET ME ASK YOU THIS -- I GOTTA STEP OUT, GUYS. HUH? I FEEL NAUSEATED. [ RETCHING ] YOU ALL RIGHT, BRO? YEAH. I'VE DONE COUNTLESS INVESTIGATIONS AND HAVE NEVER HAD SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN. IT LITERALLY FELT LIKE SOMETHING SUCKED ALL OF THE ENERGY OUT OF ME. THEN I BECAME IMMEDIATELY HOT. THEN I GOT NAUSEATED. AND MY HEAD WAS REALLY POUNDIN'. AFTER FEELING THAT, LIKE, I KNOW SOMETHING'S UP THERE. I WENT TO THAT TRASH CAN. DON'T THROW UP ON ME. UP HERE, LIKE, I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER, BRO. THE SECOND FLOOR ISN'T THE ONLY LOCATION THAT THE YOUNG GIRL IS RUMORED TO HAUNT. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE PLACES ON THE PROPERTY. PEOPLE ALSO REPORT SEEING THE LITTLE GIRL'S APPARITION IN THE BALLROOM AND HEARING THE SOUND OF CHILD-LIKE LAUGHTER. AND AT ONE POINT, SOMEONE THAT DID THE TOURS HERE... [ COOING ] THAT'S A PIGEON. THAT'S A PIGEON? THEY'RE ON THE EAVES OUT THERE. MAN, VERONICA, YOU GAVE US A LOT OF USEFUL INFORMATION. THERE'S SO MANY CLAIMS IN THE BARN AND THE MAIN HOUSE. SO OUR GOAL IS TO FIND OUT IF PROSPECT PLACE'S HISTORY AS BEING A STOP ON THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD AND ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE LIVED AND DIED HERE DURING THAT TIME PERIOD ARE BEHIND THE PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. - I THINK NIGHTFALL IS UPON US. - YEAH. I THINK IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME, MAN. WE REALLY NEED TO TACKLE THIS PROPERTY. SO WHAT YOU THINKIN'? POP THIS TRUNK ON 'EM. POP THE TRUNK! I SAY, GENTLEMEN, WE GET EQUIPPED, GET UP IN THAT BASEMENT AND THAT BARN. AND LET'S SEE WHAT'S REALLY GOIN' ON. - HERE IT IS. - LET'S GET IT. WE DECIDED TO START OUR INVESTIGATION IN THE BARN BECAUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT BROUGHT US OUT HERE. - I WANT TO SET UP A REM-POD... - RIGHT IN THAT SPOT? LITERALLY, RIGHT UNDER WHERE THE BOUNTY HUNTER WAS ALLEGEDLY HUNG. IT'S A HOT BED OF A LOT OF ACTIVITY. CLAIMS OF, UH, KIM GETTIN' SCRATCHED BY THE BOUNTY HUNTER. WE HAD THE CADAVER DOG EARLIER TODAY. I THINK WE MIGHT EVEN HAVE A BODY DOWN THERE. LET'S GO SEE. I FEEL LIKE THE AIR -- [ WARBLING ] OH, THAT'S JUST A BIRD. THAT'S JUST A BIRD, BRO. LET'S GET THIS THING GOING, BRO. SO WHAT THE REM-POD IS GONNA DO, MAN... ANY ENERGY THAT COMES NEAR THIS ANTENNA IS GONNA FORCE THESE LIGHTS TO LIGHT UP AND THE SOUNDS TO GO. - SEE. - THERE IT IS. - THERE IT IS. - ALL RIGHT. LISTEN. WE GONNA KEEP THAT THERE, MAN. LET'S JUST MONITOR THAT WHILE WE'RE IN HERE. I'M GONNA BRING OUT MY VOICE RECORDER TOO, MAN, BECAUSE I DEFINITELY WANT TO GET SOME EVPs BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, UH, JOY AND KIM SAID THAT THEY WOULD ASK QUESTIONS. AND THEY HEARD ANSWERS ON THEIR RECORDING DEVICES. I'M-A START IT OFF WITH A QUESTION. IS THERE ANYONE IN THIS ROOM THAT WE CANNOT SEE? BRO. THAT'S ACTIVITY. HOLY ****. IS THERE ANYONE IN THIS ROOM THAT WE CANNOT SEE? SO WE'RE HERE AT THE BARN AT PROSPECT PLACE. IT'S A REAL HOT SPOT OF ACTIVITY. THIS IS WHERE LEGEND HAS IT THAT, YOU KNOW, THE BOUNTY HUNTER WAS HANGED FROM THE THIRD FLOOR. THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE CREEPIEST PLACES I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. THAT'S ACTIVITY. IF YOU'RE HERE, PRESENT YOURSELF. LIKE, IT REALLY SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS, LIKE, A SOFT FOOTSTEP. BRO, THESE STAIRS ARE BOARDED UP. BUT WE CAN PROBABLY GET UP THERE. ALL RIGHT. I'LL GET UP THERE. DALEN AND I DECIDED TO CLIMB OVER SOME THINGS, MAKE OUR WAY TO THE THIRD FLOOR. WHAT IT LOOK LIKE UP THERE? HELL. WE GET UP THERE, AND **** JUST GETS SPOOKY, MAN. HOLY ****. LOOK AT THAT ****, BRO. - I SEE THAT. - WHY IS THERE A NOOSE HANGIN' FROM THE BEAM WITH A CHAIR, WITH A BROKEN BOTTOM AS IF SOMEONE FELL THROUGH? - WORD? - THIS IS WHERE ALLEGEDLY THE BOUNTY HUNTER WAS HUNG FROM THIS BEAM. I'M TRYIN' TO SEE IF I CAN GET CLOSER. I WANNA GET CLOSER TO THIS -- TO THIS ROPE. AND I WANT YOU TO PUT THE GRID ON ME. WE ARE USING A LASER GRID PID THAT PROJECTS A GRID OF DOTS, WHICH WILL HELP US TO DETECT ANY MOVEMENT BY THE SPIRITS IF THE LASER BEAM IS BROKEN. WHAT DO YOU SEE? I REALLY JUST SEE YOU. AND I SEE YOUR SHADOW. WHAT'D THEY SAY? HE DON'T -- HE DON'T LIKE FLASHING LIGHT? PHOTOS. YOU CAN DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE THERE'S A PRESENCE IN HERE. YOU KNOW, IT JUST ALWAYS FEELS LIKE THERE'S SOMEBODY BEHIND YOUR BACK. I'M GONNA ASK QUESTIONS ON THE VOICE RECORDER RIGHT HERE BY THE NOOSE AND THE CHAIR. IF THE LEGEND OF THE BOUNTY HUNTER IS ANYWHERE NEAR TRUE, THEN THAT MEANS THAT THE BOUNTY HUNTER WAS A TRUE ****. AND WE THOUGHT THE BEST WAY TO PROVOKE THE SPIRIT OF THE BOUNTY HUNTER WAS TO BE JUST AS AGGRESSIVE AS HE WAS. WHY DO YOU ONLY TALK OR SHOW YOURSELF OR TOUCH WOMEN? ARE YOU AFRAID OF MEN? YO. YO. THAT REM-POD IS GOIN' CRAZY. WANNA BE ALL BIG AND TOUGH WHEN WOMEN COME AROUND OR, LIKE, WHEN YOU LOOKIN' FOR SLAVES AND BOUNTY HUNTIN' AND ****. BUT YOU GOT THREE PEOPLE HERE NOW. DO SOMETHING! AS YOU GUYS CAN SEE, THAT'S NOT US. YOU ARE A SPIRIT THAT IS NOT WELCOME ON THIS PROPERTY. Y'ALL, I DON'T THINK HE LIKES Y'ALL TALKING **** TO HIM. HE GONNA HAVE TO COME SAY IT TO MY FACE. WELL, HE SAYIN' IT IN THIS REM-POD. WELL, IF HE A MAN, COME SAY IT TO A MAN. DALEN OR JUWAN MIGHT TRY TO TRY THE GHOST. I DON'T LIKE HOW THEY TRYIN' 'IM. I DON'T THINK HE NO PUNK. IF YOU A MAN, BE A MAN. LIKE, THIS DON'T LOOK LIKE A CHAIR THAT A **** - FELL THROUGH, BRO. - AH. STAY RIGHT THERE. TURN YOUR LIGHT OFF. OH. OKAY. NOW, WHAT YOU GONNA DO? OH, ****. I LITERALLY FELT LIKE SOMEBODY JUST **** PUSHED ME, BRO. WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF CLAIMS ABOUT THE SPIRIT IN THE BARN BEING REALLY AGGRESSIVE, IN SOME CASES ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY TOUCHING PEOPLE. I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD ACTUALLY HAPPEN TO ME. BUT I GOT HIM REAL PISSED, I GUESS, BY BEING REAL AGGRESSIVE WITH HIM. AND I FELT HIM PUSH ME. LIKE, IT'S THE CRAZIEST THING I'VE EVER FELT IN MY LIFE. BRO. THE WAY DALEN AND JUWAN WERE TALKING TO THAT GHOST, I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE PUSHED OR PUNCHED 'EM TOO. YO. THIS CREEPY, BRO. HEY, WE COMIN' DOWN, MARCUS. NOW THAT WE'VE GOT SOME WILD RESPONSES FROM THE SPIRIT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE BOUNTY HUNTER WHO WAS REPORTEDLY HANGED HERE DURING THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD ERA, WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO THE BASEMENT, WHERE SLAVES WOULD HIDE, AND SEE WHAT OTHER ACTIVITY WE CAN FIND. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE, LIKE, CREEPIN' DOWN HERE LATE AT NIGHT, MAN, IF YOU WAS A PART OF, LIKE, THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. BUT IT'S KINDA COOL TO BE A PART OF HISTORY AND SEE SOME HISTORY LIKE THIS, TO KNOW THAT, LIKE, IT COULD BE, LIKE, SOME OF YOUR POTENTIAL ANCESTORS, MAN, MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALONG THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD AND MIGHT HAVE EVEN BEEN HOUSED IN HERE. RIGHT ON. THIS IS THE CORRIDOR IN THE BASEMENT WHERE A LOT OF THE SLAVES WERE SAID TO BE HOUSED. THERE'S A LOT OF CLAIMS DOWN HERE. THERE'S BEEN CLAIMS OF THE SHADOW MAN DOWN HERE WITH THE RED EYES, LURKING. WHAT'S UP, BRUH? **** WHAT ARE YOU DOIN', BRO? HEY. YOU ALL RIGHT? IT'S JUST THE WIRES, BRUH. IT'S JUST THE WIRES -- - WIRES AND COBWEBS. - AND COBWEBS. JUST WIRES AND COBWEBS. MAN, YOU ALL RIGHT? YOU LOOKIN' REAL SCARY RIGHT NOW, HOMEY. WIRES AND COBWEBS. - YOU ALL RIGHT, BRUH? - NO. I WASN'T FOR A SECOND, TO BE HONEST. - TO BE HONEST, I GOT CAUGHT... - YOU WERE TRIPPIN' FOR A SECOND. I GOT CAUGHT UP. SO LISTEN. YOU REMEMBER WHEN THEY SAID WHEN THEY WOULD BRING THE SLAVES THROUGH HERE IN THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD... - UH-HUH. - TO LET MR. ADAMS KNOW THAT PEOPLE WERE HERE, THEY WOULD TAP ON THE CEILING... YEAH. BELOW HIS BEDROOM. I FEEL LIKE JUWAN, MAN, WE SHOULD SEND YOU TO MR. ADAMS' ROOM. ME AND MARCUS WILL GO HIT THE CEILING, TAP IT AND SEE IF IT, LIKE, TRIGGERS SOMETHING. Y'ALL -- Y'ALL BOYS WISH ME LUCK. ALL RIGHT. PSH. THE STORY HAS IT THAT THE SLAVES WOULD COME IN THROUGH THE BACK OF THE HOUSE HERE AND ALONG THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD ROUTE. AND ONCE THEY GOT IN, THEY WOULD TAP THE ROOF, WHICH IS THE FLOORBOARD OF MR. ADAMS' BEDROOM, LETTIN' HIM KNOW THAT THEY WERE THERE. ADAMS' ROOM IS DIRECTLY ABOVE THESE QUARTERS. SO WE THOUGHT IT'D BE A COOL IDEA TO TAP ON THE ROOF TO SEE IF WE CAN STIR UP SOMETHING MAYBE EITHER IN THE HOUSE OR HERE IN THE BASEMENT. SO HERE I AM IN GEORGE ADAMS' BEDROOM. UH. I DON'T LIKE THIS **** AT ALL. JUWAN, WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA TAP ON THIS ROOF RIGHT NOW. AND THEN ONCE WE DO THAT, WE'RE GONNA SEE IF THAT INVOKES ANY TYPE OF, UH, ACTIVITY OKAY? WELL, I'LL SIT PATIENTLY IN THIS CHAIR. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I GOT THIS TWO-BY-FOUR. DID YOU HEAR THAT TAPPING NOISE, OVER? I'M PRETTY SURE THEY HEARD THAT **** AROUND THE CORNER. THAT **** WAS LOUD. LOOK AT THIS WELL. YO, THIS IS THE SAME WELL THAT THE RUNAWAY SLAVES USED FOR DRINKING WATER SO THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE AND BE SEEN BY THE BOUNTY HUNTERS. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE SPIRIT WAS HIDING IN THAT HOLE? I DON'T KNOW, IT COULD HAVE BEEN. DUDE, I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY HAS TO GO IN THERE AND LOOK. WELL, THE BEAUTY -- THE BEAUTY OF MY SHAPE IS I WON'T FIT DOWN THERE. AND THE BEAUTY OF YOUR SHAPE IS... I FIT PERFECTLY. YOU FIT LIKE A GLOVE. BRO, MY SHIRT TOO CLEAN TO GO DOWN THERE, BROTHER. THEN YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE SUGGESTED IT. BRO. BRO, THERE'S TWO LIGHTS. THAT COULD JUST BE DUST PARTICLES. NO. THEY'RE NOT... THESE ARE NOT DUST PARTICLES. THEY'RE STANDING THERE. COME LOOK. DO YOU SEE THIS ON MY CAMERA? IT'S, LIKE, TWO RED EYES. IT'S LIKE THE TWO EYES THAT PEOPLE SAID THAT THEY WOULD SEE. DO YOU SEE THAT? WHAT IS IT? OH. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. DO YOU SEE THIS ON MY CAMERA? IT'S, LIKE, TWO RED EYES. IT'S LIKE THE TWO EYES THAT PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY WOULD SEE. DO YOU SEE THAT? OH. I DO SEE IT. YOU SEE THEM DANCIN'? WHAT IS IT? BROTHER, THAT'S YOUR LIGHTS FROM YOUR CAMERA. WHAT LIGHTS, MARCUS? THE RED LIGHTS. NO. IT'S NOT. LOOK ON THE FRONT OF YOUR CAMERA. - WHERE? - THOSE RED LIGHTS THAT YOU JUST LOOKED AT. NO. IT'S NOT. DO YOU SEE IT NOW? IT'S THE SAME RED LIGHT, BROTHER. AND NOW, IT'S NOT ON THE CAMERA ANY MORE. SO NOW, WHAT ARE YOU SAYIN'? SO I THOUGHT YOU WAS RIGHT. BUT IT'S NOT THERE ANY MORE. YOU MADE... WHATEVER YOU DID, IT LEFT BECAUSE NOTHING'S CHANGED. THE RED LIGHT'S STILL THERE. I'M POINTING IN THE SAME DIRECTION. AND THOSE TWO DANCING RED LIGHTS ARE GONE. THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME TYPE OF ACTIVITY IN HERE, BRO. WOW. DEFINITELY. AT FIRST, I WAS LIKE, "MAN, THAT'S JUST THE LIGHT." BUT THEN WHEN YOU PUT THE CAMERA DOWN AND TOOK IT BACK UP, AND THERE WAS NO EYES THERE... YO, THAT'S CREEPY. DO YOU THINK THOSE RED LIGHTS COULD HAVE BEEN THOSE RED EYES THAT PEOPLE SAY THAT THEY SEE? IT COULD'VE BEEN, MAN. ACTUALLY, WANNA PUT THIS CAMERA RIGHT NEAR THAT HOLE SO IT CAN MONITOR IT WHILE WE GO UPSTAIRS? DO THAT. DO IT. YEAH. I'M GONNA JUST BE HONEST WITH YOU. THIS JOINT LOOKS CREEPY AS ALL GET OUT. NOTHING ABOUT THIS HOUSE SAYS "COME IN." EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS HOUSE SAYS, "YOU'RE NOT COMING BACK OUT." [ CREAKING ] SUP, FELLAS? WHAT'S UP, BRO? Y'ALL A'IGHT? YEAH, MAN. Y'ALL ENJOY LEAVING ME BY MYSELF, HUH? BRO, WE CAUGHT SOME ACTIVITY IN THAT HOUSE IN THAT -- IN THAT BASEMENT, MAN. THERE WAS LITERALLY TWO RED LIGHTS, YOU KNOW, LIKE TWO RED EYES. I THINK THE RED EYES THAT WE FOUND IN THE BASEMENT MAY HAVE BEEN A PRESENCE FROM THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD. AND ANY PRESENCE STILL LINGERING IN THERE KNOWS THAT WE DON'T MEAN IT ANY HARM. I THINK IT'LL BE ONLY RIGHT IF WE GO ALL THE WAY UP TO THE CUPOLA... - OKAY. - AND PUT A LIGHT - INSIDE THE CUPOLA... - I GOT YOU. BECAUSE ANY TIME THERE WAS A LIGHT IN THE CUPOLA -- - IT WAS SAFE. - IT WAS A SIGNAL TO THE SLAVES - THAT IT WAS SAFE. - YES. AND HOPEFULLY PLACING A LIGHT UP THERE WILL STIR UP SOME MORE ACTIVITY HERE IN THE HOUSE. SO LET'S GO UP OUR WAY TO THE TOP, MAN, AND JUST WORK OUR WAY BACK DOWN TO THE FIRST FLOOR WITH IT. LET'S GET IT. IF THERE ARE ANY SPIRITS IN HERE, SPIRITS OF SLAVES, JUST KNOW THAT PEOPLE DO CARE. CUT THE LIGHT ON. OH. YEAH. JUST SET IT RIGHT THERE. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. I GOT YOU, MAN. LET'S LEAVE THIS LIGHT ON IN HERE, MAN. AND HOPEFULLY, THAT'LL JUST LET THE FREEDOM... YEAH. LET FREEDOM RING. LET THE FREEDOM RING. RIGHT ON. WHAT WE CHECKIN' OUT NOW. I THINK ME AND JUWAN SHOULD BE IN THE, YOU KNOW, THE BALLROOM BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE CLAIMED THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME KIDS PLAYIN' IN THERE. SO WE CAN BRING THAT OUT. BUT YOU SAID YOU AND JUWAN. SO WHILE Y'ALL IN THE DANCE HALL, WHERE AM I FINNA' BE? SECOND FLOOR BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE MOST EXPERIENCE. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT -- IT ONLY MAKES SENSE. LEGEND HAS IT THAT ON THE SECOND FLOOR, A LITTLE GIRL FELL FROM THE BALCONY AND DIED. IT'S ALSO BELIEVED THAT HER SPIRIT STILL HAUNTS THE SECOND FLOOR AND THE THIRD FLOOR BALLROOM. WE BELIEVE THAT LITTLE GIRL REACHED OUT TO DALEN EARLIER TODAY - AND MADE HIM PHYSICALLY ILL -- - [ DALEN RETCHING ] WHICH MAKES HIM THE PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR BAIT. I'M NOT INVITED TO THE PARTY? NO. YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE INVITED TO THE SECOND-FLOOR PARTY. IT'S A AFTER-PARTY. ON THE SECOND FLOOR. ON THE SECOND FLOOR, AND YOU'RE INVITED. - JUST LIKE HIGH SCHOOL. - YEAH. IT'S ALL RIGHT. WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IS... TURN THAT LIGHT ON. TURN THE LIGHT ON. THERE YOU GO. STAY CLOSE TO THE WALL TOO. SO THE SQUAD IS MAKING ME COME DOWN TO THE SECOND FLOOR TO USE ME AS BAIT OR A TRIGGER OBJECT BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE SOMETHING IN THIS HOUSEHOLD IS ATTRACTED TO ME. GO CHECK OUT THE DOOR STRAIGHT AHEAD BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT'S WHERE THEY SAID THAT GIRL FELL FROM. SHE WALKED RIGHT OFF OF IT. MAN, I'LL -- I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT. I'M GOING TO THE BALLROOM. I LOVE YOU, BROTHER. MAN, Y'ALL ARE TRIPPIN', HOMEY. SO ME AND JUWAN ARE IN THE BALLROOM BECAUSE WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF ACCOUNTS OF KIDS PLAYIN' UP THERE, NOT THE LIVE ONES, BUT THE DEAD ONES. AND I'M PLAYFUL. SO MAYBE THESE KIDS WANT TO PLAY WITH ME. YOU KNOW, I USED TO BE A SUMMER CAMP COUNSELOR. HEY, PRINCESS. HOW ARE YOU? YEAH. YOU WANNA COME OUT AND PLAY? DO YOU LIKE ME AND MY FRIEND, JUWAN? YOU SOUND LIKE A CREEP. I DO. OH, MAN. SO I'M ON THE SECOND FLOOR. AND THIS IS WHERE MY HEAD STARTED TO HURT. AND I GOT NAUSEATED AND THREW UP. THIS IS ALSO THE SAME LITTLE HALLWAY THAT THEY SAID THE LITTLE GIRL CAN BE SEEN. AND THAT SHE FELL OUT THIS WINDOW. ARE YOU HERE? ARE YOU RELATED TO GEORGE ADAMS? **** IS THIS THE WINDOW? IS THIS WHERE YOU SLIPPED? OR DID SOMEONE PUSH YOU? [ THUD, BLEEP ] ARE YOU HERE? SO ON THE SECOND FLOOR IN THE MAIN HOUSE, RUMOR HAS IT THAT A LITTLE GIRL FELL OUTTA THAT BALCONY RIGHT THERE, HIT HER HEAD AND PASSED AWAY. SO I WANT TO SEE IF I CAN TRY TO STIR UP SOMETHING WITH HER, SEE IF I CAN GET HER ATTENTION. IS THIS WHERE YOU SLIPPED? [ CRASH, BLEEP ] **** YO, WHAT'S THAT SOUND? DALEN? **** WAS THAT YOU, SWEETIE? Dalen, copy? BRUH, I HEARD A LITTLE SOUND OUT HERE IN THE HALLWAY. You all right? I ain't gonna lie to you, man. It's really creepy down here, bro. IF Y'ALL DON'T HEAR FROM ME, JUST -- JUST KNOW THAT Y'ALL WAS MY REAL FRIENDS. THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION. ALL RIGHT, MAN. SO ME AND JUWAN ARE IN THE BALLROOM. THEY SAID THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ACTIVITY WITH CHILDREN LAUGHIN' AND PLAYIN'. IT'S A REALLY, REALLY ACTIVE HOUSE. I JUST WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN PULL SOME STUFF OUT. ARE THERE ANY OTHER BEINGS IN THIS ROOM BESIDES ME AND JUWAN? YO. YO, COME ON OVER HERE REAL QUICK. YOU GOT SOMETHIN'? I LIE TO YOU NOT. LIKE, WHEN I SAID, "ARE WE THE ONLY ONES IN THIS ROOM," LIKE, SOMETHING RIGHT IN THIS AREA JUST STARTED SCRATCHIN'. I DON'T KNOW -- SHH, SHH, SHH. WHERE? AS SOON AS I SAID, "IS THERE ANYBODY BESIDES ME AND YOU IN HERE"... ARE THERE ANY OTHER BEINGS IN MY ROOM BESIDES ME AND JUWAN? YO. I'M-A ASK MORE QUESTIONS. NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST ME AND JUWAN IN HERE, ARE WE WELCOMED HERE? IF YOU'RE A CHILD, SHOW ME A SIGN. I'M GONNA PLAY WITH THE BALL AND SEE IF I CAN GET SOME ACTION. WHY DON'T WE SET THE BALL IN THE MIDDLE - AND SEE IF IT MOVES? - ALL RIGHT. LET'S PUT IT ON THE FLATTEST SURFACE WE CAN FIND. WITH THERE BEING SO MANY CLAIMS IN THE BALLROOM OF KIDS, ME AND JUWAN DECIDE TO PUT A BALL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR. IF IT MOVES FROM HERE... I THINK WE SHOULD SING A NURSERY RHYME. OKAY. "TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR"? YEAH. LET'S DO THAT. LET'S GO. ♪ TWINKLE, TWINKLE LITTLE STAR ♪ ♪ HOW I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE ♪ ♪ SOMETHING, SOMETHING, SOMETHING, ♪ ♪ SOMETHING, SOMETHING... ♪ HAS IT MOVED? NAH. MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW THE REST OF THE WORDS. ♪♪ SO IN THIS ROOM, IT SEEMS TO BE LIKE SOME TYPE OF BASSINET WHERE YOU WOULD PUT A BABY BECAUSE IT'S FILLED WITH DOLLS. WOULD IT UPSET YOU IF I MOVED SOME OF YOUR TOYS? A LITTLE GIRL SUPPOSEDLY DIED UP HERE. SO I WANNA MAYBE PUT SOME TOYS AS TRIGGER OBJECTS AND GET MY EVP MACHINE, ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND MAYBE GET SOME ANSWERS. THE CREEPIEST DOLL I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE. MAYBE IF I SET ONE OF THESE DOLLS OUT HERE IN THE HALLWAY, IT'LL TRIGGER SOME TYPE OF RESPONSE. SINCE THE RUMOR HAS IT THAT THE LITTLE GIRL FELL BY THE DOOR, I'M GONNA SET THIS DOLL RIGHT BY THE DOOR. LET'S LEAVE A LITTLE CAMERA ON YOU FOR A SECOND. NOW, IF YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH YOUR DOLL, FEEL FREE TO PLAY WITH HER. SHE'S ALL YOURS. I'M JUST GONNA WATCH THE DOLL FOR A COUPLE MINUTES. HELLO? I KNOW THEY SAY YOU HURT YOURSELF UP HERE. ARE YOU STILL HERE? I PUT A PRESENT BY THE DOOR. LET'S PLAY. I JUST WANNA SEE YOU. IS THAT YOU, SWEETIE? FOR MORE "GHOST BROTHERS"... DIGITAL EXCLUSIVE AND SNEAK PEAKS... GO TO... - GHOST BROTHERS! - YEAH, GHOSTIN'... STRAIGHT GHOSTIN'. I'M GONNA SET THIS DOLL RIGHT BY THE DOOR. I'M ON THE SECOND FLOOR, TRYING TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE LITTLE GIRL WHO REPORTEDLY FELL OFF THE BALCONY TO HER DEATH. I'M USING A DOLL AS A TRIGGER OBJECT. I PUT A PRESENT BY THE DOOR. AND AN I.R. CAMERA TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT. IS THAT YOU, SWEETIE? I DON'T KNOW. IT JUST FEEL LIKE YOU FEEL A PRESENCE. YOU FEEL A PRESENCE IN HERE. SO WE'VE HEARD CLAIMS THAT YOU UP HERE PLAYIN' BY YOURSELF. WELL, WE CAME TO PLAY WITH YOU, LITTLE KID. WE'RE HERE IN THE BALLROOM. AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO GET SOME KIDS ACTIVE UP HERE, MAN. SO PULL OUT A BALL, WANTED TO SEE IF THEY WANTED TO PLAY. MAYBE YOU COULD KICK THE BALL TO ONE OF US. - WHAT WAS THAT? - YOU HEARD IT? YEAH. WHAT WAS THAT? THEY SAY THEY GET CHILDREN LAUGHING, FOOTSTEPS. TURN THE LIGHT ON REAL QUICK. YOU HEARD THAT, RIGHT? I HEARD IT. I JUST HAVE, LIKE, THIS OVERWHELMING SENSATION. AND I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY'S, LIKE, BEHIND ME. I'M TELLIN' YOU. THERE'S TOO MUCH ACTIVITY UP HERE. I'M GOING BACK TO MY POST. WAIT. OKAY. QUICK QUESTION, WASN'T THE BALL OVER HERE? DUDE, THE BALL WAS RIGHT HERE. YEAH. LOOK WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR. SO WE TRY TO DEBUNK IT. WE PUT THE BALL DOWN AGAIN. I DID ALL THIS MOVEMENT AROUND IT. AND IT DIDN'T EVEN MOVE. THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS JUST PICKED UP AND PUT OVER HERE, MAN. SO THERE HAD TO BE SOMETHING THAT MOVED THAT BALL. BUT IT WASN'T ME OR JUWAN. SO, MAN, IT'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY. THIS PLACE HAS A LOT OF ACTIVITY ON THE SECOND FLOOR, A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE BARN. MAN, THIS -- THIS THING GOT ME KINDA CREEPED OUT. I -- I GOTCHA. THIS WAS A GREAT INVESTIGATION FOR US ALL. WE HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCES THAT HAVE LED US TO BELIEVE THAT THIS PROPERTY, HAVING ONCE BEEN A STOP ON THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, AND ALL THOSE WHO WERE PART OF IT IS A HUGE FACTOR IN THE PARANORMAL ACTIVITY THAT GOES ON HERE. Woman: HE'S TRAINED TO TELL US WHEN HE FINDS HUMAN SCENT. Dalen: FROM THE CADAVER DOG IN THE BARN... UH-OH. WHO SUGGESTED THAT THE REMAINS OF THE NOTORIOUS BOUNTY HUNTER MAY STILL BE BURIED THERE... IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, BRO, IF YOU WAS TO HIDE A DEAD BODY IN HERE, MAN, WHERE WOULD YOU PUT IT? OFF IN THE CUT RIGHT? TO OUR OWN INTERACTION WITH THE BOUNTY HUNTER SPIRIT... AS YOU GUYS CAN SEE, THAT'S NOT US. WHO GOT REALLY WORKED UP WHEN WE ANTAGONIZED IT ABOUT SLAVERY. YOU WANNA BE ALL BIG AND TOUGH WHEN WOMEN COME AROUND, OR, LIKE, WHEN YOU LOOKIN' FOR SLAVES AND BOUNTY HUNTIN' AND ****. Y'ALL, I DON'T THINK HE LIKES Y'ALL TALKING **** TO HIM. **** I LITERALLY FELT LIKE SOMEBODY JUST **** PUSHED ME, BRO. DO YOU SEE THAT? OH. I DO SEE IT. YOU SEE THEM DANCIN'? EVIDENCE WE FOUND IN THE BASEMENT MAKES US BELIEVE THERE'S A SLAVE'S PRESENCE FROM THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD THAT STILL LINGERS IN THE HOUSE. THERE WAS TWO BEADY EYES. THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME TYPE OF ACTIVITY IN HERE, BRO. - WOW. - DEFINITELY. AND THOUGH WE CAN'T CONFIRM THAT THE YOUNG GIRL WHO MANY BELIEVE DIED HERE WAS TIED TO THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, WE HAD TO CHECK OUT THE CLAIM CENTERED AROUND HER. WE HAD A BALL SET IN ONE PARTICULAR SPOT. LOOK WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW. WE TURN AROUND. THE BALL IS 4 FEET FROM THAT SPOT. [ RETCHING ] AND WE CAN SAY WITH CERTAINTY THAT SOMETHING IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR. IS THAT YOU, SWEETIE? DO YOU GUYS FEEL LIKE IT COULD VERY WELL BE A BODY IN THERE? YES. THIS IS TYPICAL BEHAVIOR WHEN HE'S LOCATED THE SOURCE OF WHAT HE'S TO FIND. WOW. WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA ALERT THE HOMEOWNER, GEORGE, ABOUT THE RESULTS OF OUR FINDINGS WITH THE CADAVER DOG SO HE CAN ACT ON IT. AND THEN WE CAN INVESTIGATE AT A LATER DATE TO SEE IF THE CRANKY BOUNTY HUNTER SPIRIT HAS MOVED ON. PROSPECT PLACE IS CERTIFIED HAUNTED. I THINK WE'VE ALREADY OVERSTAYED OUR WELCOME, MAN. LIKE, I THINK WE NEED TO BOUNCE, MAN. I THINK IT'S DONE. BRO, THERE AIN'T NO THINKING ABOUT IT. MAN, I WITH YOU WHOLEHEARTEDLY, BROTHER. LET'S ROLL, BRUH. - LET'S ROLL. - OUT THIS THING. WE OUTTA HERE, MAN. HEY, MAN. THAT PLACE IS SPOOKY, DAWG. HEY, THIS IS "GHOST BROTHER" CERTIFIED HAUNTED. STAMP IT. GOOD JOB, FELLAS. I'M GLAD WE GOT OUTTA THERE. - Both: ALIVE. - JINX. - YEAH. - SOMEHOW. GHOST BROTHERS GHOSTING OUT.
