 DID HE JUST TAKE HIS SHIRT OFF? MAKE SURE YOU DON'T CATCH ANY SPIRITUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. I'M JUWAN AND I'M A GHOST BROTHER. Marcus: THIS IS THE OLD RULE -- IF ONE BLACK PERSON SCURRY, ALL OF THEM SCURRY. MY NAME IS MARCUS, AND I'M A GHOST BROTHER. - [ LOUD BANG ] - WHAT THE **** Dalen: OUR MISSION IS TO HIT THE MOST HAUNTED LOCATIONS IN AMERICA TO PROVE THAT GHOSTS ARE FOR REAL. ♪ GHOST BROTHERS IN THE PLACE ♪ - ♪ WHERE NO OTHER CREW ♪ - WHAT? - ♪ CAN FACE THE FEAR ♪ - WOW. ♪ MAN, WE IN HERE ♪ All: THE GHOST BROTHERS. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS HEY, THE BOYS FROM AFRICA. JUST MAKE IT NICE AND NEAT. Marcus: HEY. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE MUSA LAIR. IN THE MUSA LAIR. YOU READY TO DO SOME TRAVELING, BROTHER? WE'RE GOING TO A SAWMILL. THE LONGLEAF SAWMILL. - OKAY. - A.K.A.... THE SAWMILL OF DEATH. THAT WAS WAY TOO DRAMATIC. - IT WAS DRAMATIC. - SO DRAMATIC. WAY TOO DRAMATIC AND UNNECESSARY. - DID YOU GIVE IT THAT NICKNAME? - NO, MAN. THE PEOPLE GAVE IT THE NICKNAME, MAN. Dalen: IN THE LATE 1800s, THE CROWELL AND SPENCER COMPANY OPENED UP THE LONGLEAF SAWMILL IN LONGLEAF, LOUISIANA. THE SAWMILL WAS ITS OWN SELF-CONTAINED COMMUNITY WHICH EMPLOYED UP TO 500 PEOPLE IN ITS HEYDAY. THOSE THAT WORKED AT THE SAWMILL ALSO LIVED THERE WITH THEIR FAMILIES. SO, AT ANY TIME, THERE COULD BE UP TO 1,500 PEOPLE LIVING ON THE PROPERTY. RECORDS WEREN'T KEPT OF THE MANY DEATHS AND ACCIDENTS ON THE PROPERTY, SO THE VICTIMS REMAINED ANONYMOUS. THIS ALSO MADE IT DISTURBINGLY EASY TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER. WHAT DO YOU DO IF SOMEBODY GETS HIRED FOR A POSITION THAT YOU WANTED? - KNOCK THEM OFF. YOU MUST HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE. BRO, I'M LISTENING TO THE STORY, AND I'M LIKE, "THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GETTING PROMOTED." IT'S REAL CUTTHROAT. Dalen: IT'S BELIEVED THAT AT LEAST 60 PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES AT THE MILL BECAUSE OF UNNATURAL CAUSES. THE GRUELING WORKING CONDITIONS CAME TO AN END WHEN THE SAWMILL CLOSED IN 1969. BUT THOSE THAT LOST THEIR LIVES HERE DUE TO MURDER SEEM TO STILL BE AROUND. YOU GOT APPARITIONS... - ALL RIGHT. - ...DISEMBODIED VOICES... - ALL RIGHT. - ...PEOPLE GETTING TOUCHED. - ALL RIGHT. THEY SAY THEY CAN GET A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE TOO, MAN. THEY TRYING TO GET MORE JOBS. THAT'S WHAT IT IS. - YEAH. - WELL, GUYS, THERE'S ONLY THING LEFT TO DO. - TRèS GHOSTY. - HEAD TO LOUISIANA. [ TRAIN HORN BLOWS ] Dalen: THIS IS A SAWMILL, MAN. YOU GUYS EVER BEEN TO A SAWMILL BEFORE? Marcus: NAH, BRO. Juwan: IMAGINE THE BODIES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE HAUNTING THIS LOCATION. BRO, BODIES WAS GETTING CHOPPED UP. THERE'S PROBABLY ALL TYPE OF REMNANTS OF BODIES OR BODY PARTS AND DEATH. - IN SAWMILLS. ♪♪ WOW. BRO, LOOK AT THIS. LOOK HOW BIG THAT IS. THIS THING SITS ON LIKE 60 ACRES. BRO, I AIN'T WALKING NO 60 ACRES. - OH, MAN. [ LAUGHTER ] Dalen: AFTER THE SAWMILL CEASED TO OPERATE IN 1969, IT WAS BASICALLY LEFT UNTOUCHED UNTIL IT BECAME A MUSEUM IN THE 1990s. ALL RIGHT, GUYS. JUST KEEP GOING. SO WE'RE GONNA MEET UP WITH TRACY, ONE OF THE VOLUNTEERS, SO HE CAN SHOW US SOME OF THE MOST HAUNTED PLACES AROUND THE MILL. WE'RE IN THE SAWMILL. THIS IS WHERE ALL THE LUMBER WAS CUT. HIGH-QUALITY LONGLEAF PINE WAS MILLED HERE WITH UP TO 125,000 BOARD FEET A DAY BEING PROCESSED. THIS AREA HAS ALSO SEEN A LOT OF TRAGEDY. THIS IS WHERE WE KNOW THE BEST DOCUMENTATION OF SOMEBODY BEING KILLED. THIS HAPPENED RIGHT HERE. RIGHT WHERE DALEN IS STANDING? YEAH, ABOUT RIGHT THERE, I GUESS, AS FAR AS WE KNOW. OKAY. A HATED FOREMAN GOT HIS 16-YEAR-OLD SON A JOB WORKING IN THE MILL. IT'S RUMORED THAT ANOTHER WORKER KILLED HIS SON FOR TAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S JOBS. THEY PUSHED A BOY TO HIS DEATH IN THE WOOD CHIPPER. BUT HE FELL INTO THIS PIT. NOW, THIS PIT, AS WE CALL IT... OH. DID YOU JUST TOUCH ME? - NO. - DID YOU JUST TOUCH ME? - HANDS IN MY POCKET. DUDE, LITERALLY FELT LIKE SOMEBODY WAS, LIKE, PUT THEY WHOLE HAND ON MY LEFT CHEEK AND KIND OF WAS LIKE THAT. - OKAY, THIS WHAT HAPPENS. AND I WAS LIKE, "WHY IS JUWAN TOUCHING ME?" - THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED ON TOURS. - NO, SIR. - I SWEAR, BRO. I SWEAR. - DEFINITELY NOT US. GOD, MY HAND TO GOD, I SWEAR. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS ON TOURS. I'LL BE TELLING THIS EXACT SAME STORY, AND SOMEBODY WILL GET PUSHED OR FELT LIKE THEY'RE BEING PUSHED INTO THAT. - THAT'S WEIRD. - YEAH. OTHER CLAIMS IN THE SAWMILL INCLUDE SHADOW FIGURES, VOICES, AND EVEN APPARITIONS WHICH HAVE SHOWN UP IN PHOTOS. BUT THE SAWMILL IS ONLY ONE OF THE MANY PLACES ON THIS PROPERTY TO SEE TRAGIC DEATH. IN 1895, THE LONGLEAF MILL PURCHASED ITS FIRST 20-TON LOCOMOTIVE TO TRANSPORT LUMBER AND WORKERS AROUND THE PROPERTY. MORE TRAINS FOLLOWED, AND SO DID THE DEATHS. IN FRONT OF THE COMMISSARY, A WORKER FELL OFF A MOVING TRAIN WHILE WAVING TO HIS SON. HE WAS CRUSHED ON THE TRACKS. SOME PEOPLE HAVE SPECULATED THAT THIS WASN'T AN ACCIDENT, AND HE MAY HAVE BEEN PUSHED TO HIS DEATH. NOW PEOPLE HEAR TRAIN WHISTLES WHEN THE TRAIN ISN'T RUNNING AND DISEMBODIED VOICES. BUT THE MOST NOTORIOUS TALES AT THE MILL INVOLVE THE DREADED DEAD MAN STOKES. SO, THIS SKIDDER BEHIND US, THAT'S WHERE THE INFAMOUS WORKER DEAD MAN STOKES WOULD BE? - YEAH. DEAD MAN STOKES WAS A WINCH OPERATOR ON THIS SKIDDER. IT WAS HIS JOB TO OPERATE THE LINE THAT WOULD DRAG THE FELLED LOGS THROUGH THE WOODS. HE GOT PAID BASED ON THE NUMBER OF LOGS HE PULLED IN. TO INCREASE HIS PAY... - OKAY! ...HE WOULD SOMETIMES PULL THE LOGS IN BEFORE THE LINES WERE SECURE. HIS RECKLESS BEHAVIOR LED TO MANY DEATHS AT THE SAWMILL. PEOPLE ACTUALLY LOST THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF THIS ONE MAN'S GREED. I WOULD BE PISSED IF I WAS KILLED. I WOULD HAUNT THIS PLACE TOO, FOREVER. Tracy: THIS WAS A BELT-DRIVEN MACHINE SHOP. YOU'VE HAD SOME EXPERIENCES IN HERE? OH, YES. THIS IS ONE OF THE HOT SPOTS. - OKAY. - OH, OKAY. THIS IS WHERE I'VE HEARD VOICES, AND A LOT OF THE ACTIVITY IS BEHIND ME ON THE 202, THIS ENGINE. - OKAY. TRACY, LET ME ASK YOU A HUGE FAVOR. SURE. DO YOU MIND COMING OUT WITH US TONIGHT AND DOING A LITTLE BIT OF INVESTIGATING WITH US? - I WOULD LOVE TO. - SO, TRACY SUGGESTED THAT WE MEET UP WITH THE GUYS FROM LOUISIANA SPIRITS, A LOCAL PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION TEAM, BECAUSE THEY HAD SOME PRETTY CRAZY THINGS HAPPEN TO THEM HERE AT THE MILL. WELCOME TO THE GENERATOR ROOM. THIS IS WHERE THE SAWMILL USED TO GET A LOT OF ITS POWER. I'VE BEEN A PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR NOW FOR OVER 14 YEARS, AND THIS ROOM RIGHT HERE IS ONE OF MY TOP FIVE MOMENTS THAT I'VE EVER HAD. WELL, WE START HEARING FOOTSTEPS WALKING ALONG THE METAL IRON BARS UP THERE. WOW. AND THEN WE ACTUALLY HEARD THE FOOTSTEPS COME DOWN THE STAIRWAY. - YEAH, YEAH. WE START HEARING THE FOOTSTEPS COMING TOWARDS US. AND YOU STARTED GETTING THAT FEELING OF "YOU'RE NOT WELCOME IN HERE." - YEAH. BRANDON'S ASSOCIATE, BRAD, IS GONNA MEET US IN THE PLANER MILL TO TALK ABOUT STRANGE EXPERIENCES THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO HIM AT THE SAWMILL. I'VE HAD PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST INTENSE EXPERIENCES OVER HERE. - REALLY? IT WAS RIGHT IN THIS AREA, AND I JUST FELT A POKE, RIGHT IN THE BACKSIDE. - HE GOT POKED IN HIS BACKSIDE. - OH, YEAH? THAT MAKES US BOOTY BROTHERS I GUESS. - OH! [ LAUGHTER ] THAT WAS A GOOD ONE. THAT WAS A GOOD ONE, BRAD. - I MEAN, THAT SEALED IT. BRAD IS OFFICIALLY ON THIS INVESTIGATION. I MEAN, HIM AND DALEN ARE BOOTY BROTHERS. WE WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO COME THROUGH WITH THE GHOST BROTHERS... - YEAH. ...AND GET THIS INVESTIGATION THING GOING. - NO PROBLEM. - LET'S GET IT POPPING, BRAD. - LET'S GO. - SO, OUR MISSION FOR THIS INVESTIGATION IS TO FIND OUT IF THE LONGLEAF SAWMILL IS REALLY HAUNTED BY THE SPIRITS OF WORKERS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN MURDERED HERE. AND IF SO, WHO WERE THESE WORKERS? WERE THEY TRULY MURDERED? AND WHY ARE THEY STILL HANGING AROUND? ♪♪ - I THINK IT'S THAT TIME. - WHAT TIME IS IT? TIME TO POP THE TRUNK ON THEM GHOSTS. WE HAVE SOME STUFF FOR YOU GUYS TONIGHT. LET'S CHECK IT OUT. WE CAN DEFINITELY GET THIS POPPING. OOH. A DUNE BUGGY? A DUNE BUGGY BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THESE LITTLE TIGHT SITUATIONS OVER HERE IN THIS LITTLE BUILDING. YOU MIGHT WANT TO BE GENTLE WITH THAT. WE'RE GONNA PUT HIS DOWN THERE. WE'RE GONNA GET THIS THING MOVING. I SEE THAT YOU GOT THE GoPro AND THE I.R., BUT HOW IS IT STRAPPED ON? WITH DUCT TAPE, JUWAN. - THAT'S WHY IT LOOKS SO FRAGILE. - THAT'S INNOVATION. SHUT UP. Y'ALL DON'T TALK ABOUT HOW MacGYVER GETS STUFF DONE. YOU ALWAYS WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I'M DOING. THAT DUCT TAPE IS WORKING. MAN, I'M SO HYPED TO GET THIS INVESTIGATION STARTED. BUT BEFORE WE BEGIN WITH OUR GUEST INVESTIGATOR, WE HAVE TO GET THIS PROPERTY TALK. SO WE ARE GONNA MEET UP WITH THE SAWMILL'S TRAIN CONDUCTOR, EVERETT, AND TAKE A RIDE WITH HIM. - EVERETT, WHAT'S UP, HOMEY? - OH, MAN. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU GUYS OUT HERE. HAVE YOU NOW? WITH US HOPPING ON THIS ENGINE AND CRANKING THAT BAD BOY UP, HOPEFULLY WE CAN STIR SOMETHING UP ON THIS PROPERTY. Everett: WE ARE READY TO GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD. OKAY. [ TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS ] - OKAY. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. IF THE SPIRITS WEREN'T UP AND ACTIVE, WITH THAT HORN, THEY'RE UP NOW. WE WANT TO STOP UP HERE WHERE DUDE FELL OFF THE TRAIN AND GOT CUT IN HALF. - YEAH. WE ARE GONNA STOP PRECISELY ON THAT SPOT. ♪♪ SO, I DON'T KNOW, MAN, MAYBE WE CAN, LIKE, DO SOME TYPE OF... WHAT DO YOU HAVE WITH YOU? THE REM-POD? I GOT THE REM-POD, BRO. Marcus: SO WE'RE OUT BY THE COMMISSARY AREA. AND THERE HAVE BEEN CLAIMS OF PHANTOM WHISTLES BLOWING WHEN THERE'S NO TRAINS, VOICES, AND JUST APPARITIONS. MAN, THIS PLACE IS CREEPY. Y'ALL THINK ALL THREE OF US CAN GET UP HERE? YEAH. Dalen: MAN, I WOULD PUT IT RIGHT HERE ON THE EDGE OF THE PLATFORM. YOU FEEL LIKE THAT MAY BE WHERE THE DAD IS 'CAUSE IT'S THE BACK OF THE TRAIN? I FEEL LIKE THE DAD WOULD HAVE FELL OFF THE BACK OF THE TRAIN RIGHT HERE, SO I WANT THAT AS CLOSE TO THE TRAIN. - OKAY. OKAY. - HOW ABOUT WE ASK SOME QUESTIONS AND SEE IF WE CAN KIND OF GET SOME ANSWERS? - ALL RIGHT. - IS ANYONE HERE WITH US? IS SOMEONE HERE THAT WANTS TO TALK TO US? DID YOU WORK ON THE TRAIN? ARE YOU THE FATHER WHO FELL OFF THE TRAIN? [ REM-POD BEEPING ] HOLY **** Juwan: DID YOU WORK ON THE TRAIN? Dalen: ARE YOU THE FATHER WHO FELL OFF THE TRAIN? [ REM-POD BEEPING ] HOLY **** OKAY. MAN, THIS SPOT IS GOING CRAZY. IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE THE DUDE THAT FELL OR WAS PUSHED OFF THE TRAIN. BUT YOUR BOY NOT 100% SURE JUST YET. ARE YOU THE FATHER OF THE BOY? OKAY. WOW. DID YOU FEEL YOUR CHILD'S LAST IMAGE OF YOU WAS YOU FALLING OFF THE TRAIN AND DYING? OKAY. - DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS? [ REM-POD BEEPING ] - WOW. - OKAY. - THAT'S REGRET. I MEAN. OKAY. DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WORKED TOO MUCH? WERE YOU ACTUALLY PUSHED? ARE YOU STILL OUT HERE WITH US? IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TELL US OR YOUR FAMILY? THAT'S A YES OR NO QUESTION RIGHT THERE? YES, THAT IS A YES -- THE INITIAL QUESTION... - I AGREE WITH YOU. ...WAS A YES OR NO QUESTION, WHICH COULD HAVE LED TO A SPIRIT BOX SESSION. YOU GOT THE SPIRIT BOX? - MAYBE. - WHERE DID YOU GET THAT FROM? YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO WORRY ABOUT THAT, BROTHER. BRO, LET'S JUST FIRE THIS THING UP AND SEE IF WE CAN RE-ESTABLISH CONTACT WITH THE SPIRIT. [ STATIC ] IS THERE ANYONE HERE? Dalen: IF YOU'RE HERE, USE THIS BOX TO SPEAK TO US. LET ME CHANGE THE SWEEP RATE. IS ANYONE HERE WITH US STILL? [ STATIC ] WHAT IS YOUR NAME? WERE YOU THE MAN WHO DIED ON THE RAILROAD? NO. SO THERE MIGHT BE MULTIPLE PEOPLE OUT HERE. [ STATIC ] WERE YOU SOMEONE WHO WORKED ON THE PREMISES? WERE THE WORKING CONDITIONS DIFFICULT? IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY TO ANYBODY? Marcus: SO, WE SEEM TO HAVE MADE CONTACT WITH ONE OF THE SPIRITS OF THE EMPLOYEES, BUT HE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE TOO TALKATIVE. WE NEED TO KEEP MOVING AND SEE IF WE CAN MAKE ANY MORE CONTACT WITH ANYBODY ELSE ON THIS PROPERTY. LOOK AT THE WHEELS. GOT THE G-WAGON RIGHT HERE. OH, MAN. WE'RE RIDING IN STYLE. Dalen: SINCE WE'RE INVESTIGATING A HUGE PROPERTY, WE DEFINITELY NEED TO SPLIT UP. SO JUWAN AND MARCUS, THEY'RE GONNA MEET UP WITH LOCAL PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR BRAD AND HEAD ON OVER TO THE PLANER MILL. AS FOR ME, I'M GONNA HEAD ON OVER TO THE MACHINE SHOP TO MEET UP WITH LONGLEAF EXPERT TRACY. THIS IS DALEN AND TRACY ENTERING THE MACHINE SHOP. HOLD ON, TRACY. YOU'RE GETTING AHEAD OF ME. WELL, I'LL SLOW DOWN. MAN, THIS MACHINE ROOM HAS A LOT OF CLAIMS. I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE HEARING VOICES AND SEEING SHADOW FIGURES. I MEAN, EVEN APPARITIONS ARE POPPING UP. I REALLY WANT TO GET THIS INVESTIGATION STARTED OFF RIGHT. SO WE'RE GONNA FIRE UP THESE MACHINES AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THE ATTENTION OF ANY WORKERS THAT STILL MAY BE LINGERING AROUND HERE. Tracy: ALL RIGHT. YOU WANT TO START IT? YEAH. ARE YOU READY? 1, 2, 3. - THAT WAY. KEEP IT GOING. HOLD IT. - **** - ALL RIGHT. NOW PULL IT BACK AS HARD AS YOU CAN. THERE YOU GO. YOU GOT IT. - AND IT'S ON. - SEE THE BELT? THESE BELT-DRIVEN MACHINES ARE REALLY DANGEROUS. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE HOW MANY PEOPLE DIED BY BEING PUSHED INTO ONE OF THESE BELTS. ANYONE THAT'S IN HERE, IT'S TIME TO CLOCK IN. WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO TODAY. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS, FEEL FREE TO FIELD ALL THOSE THROUGH TRACY. OH, THANKS. RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST GETTING... I THINK I GOT THE SAME CHILL THAT YOU GOT. MINE WAS BACK HERE ON THE BACK OF MY NECK. YEP, YEP. ME TOO. OKAY, I THINK THAT WE MIGHT HAVE GOT THEM REALLY WORKING NOW, MAN. WHAT DO YOU -- - I FEEL IT. LET'S CUT THE MACHINE OFF. PUSH IT RIGHT HERE. - OH, THAT'S IT? - THAT'S IT. THE BIG THING. - PRETTY SIMPLE. - THAT'S IT. HAVE YOU EVER USED A REM-POD BEFORE? - I'VE NEVER USED ONE. - WELL, IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE, MAN. IF ANY ENERGY OR ANYTHING COMES AROUND THIS ANTENNA, IT'S GONNA LIGHT UP, AND IT'S GONNA MAKE NOISE. OKAY. OH, THAT'S GOOD. PUT IT ON IT. SO WE CAN JUST START ASKING A FEW QUESTIONS, MAN, AND JUST SEE WHAT TYPE OF RESPONSE THAT WE GET. IS ANYONE IN HERE WITH US? DID YOU USED TO WORK HERE? WERE YOU MURDERED HERE? LET US KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE BY LIGHTING UP THE REM-POD OR MAKING IT MAKE A NOISE. MAYBE THEY OFF WORK. Tracy: WELL, IT IS AFTER HOURS. RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. I'M IN THE CAB OF THE TRAIN. DOES IT BOTHER YOU THAT I'M HERE WITH YOU? HOW DOES IT FEEL HAVING SOMEBODY IN YOUR SPOT? I MEAN, WHY WON'T Y'ALL TALK TO ME, MAN? LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I'M A COOL GUY. DO YOU WANT ME OFF YOUR TRAIN? ALL RIGHT, MAN. NOW I'M STARTING TO GET FRUSTRATED, GUYS. - I MEAN, I REALLY FELT -- - [ REM-POD BEEPING ] OH **** THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS. Dalen: I'M IN THE CAB OF THE TRAIN. DOES IT BOTHER YOU THAT I'M HERE WITH YOU? ALL RIGHT, MAN. NOW I'M STARTING TO GET FRUSTRATED, GUYS. - I MEAN, I REALLY FELT -- - [ REM-POD BEEPING ] OH **** THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS. Tracy: THAT DID IT. DO IT AGAIN. SHOW US THAT YOU'RE HERE. LET IT BE KNOWN ONE MORE TIME, PLEASE. MAKE IT AGAIN. I'M TELLING YOU TO DO IT. [ REM-POD BEEPING ] GOOD JOB, TRACY. Dalen: I'M IN THE MACHINE SHOP WITH TRACY, A VOLUNTEER WHO HAS EXPERIENCED A LOT OF PARANORMAL ACTIVITY HERE IN THE SAWMILL, AND WE'VE BEEN GETTING A LOT OF ACTIVITY IN THE TRAIN CAB WITH THE REM-POD. NOW, I WANT TO SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND. ALL RIGHT. YOU WANT TO STAY OVER THERE? NO, I'M GONNA COME OVER BY YOU. THE MACHINE SHOP WAS A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE WITH BELT-OPERATED EQUIPMENT WHERE MURDER COULD THRIVE. BACK THEN, RECORDS WEREN'T KEPT TOO WELL, SO WE REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY DIED. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE WE GOT SOME SPIRIT TRYING TO REACH OUT TO US. WELL, ARE YOU GONNA COME TOWARD US A LITTLE BIT, LET US KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE? BREAK'S OVER. GET YOUR BUTT BACK TO WORK. DOES ANYONE WANT A RAISE? Y'ALL KNOW MINIMUM WAGE NOW IS, LIKE, $9.75, $10.50 AN HOUR. IS ANYONE IN HERE THAT WANTS THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN? WERE YOU KILLED IN THIS ROOM? DID YOU HEAR IT? [ TICKING ] IS THAT A CLOCK? - THAT'S A CLOCK. DID YOU HEAR IT? [ TICKING ] IS THERE A CLOCK IN HERE? - NO. NO, MAN, COME ON. ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NO CLOCK IN HERE, TRACY? THERE IS NO CLOCK. THE CLOCK I HEARD CAME FROM OVER HERE. Tracy: THERE'S NO CLOCK. THAT'S JUST WEIRD. LIKE, THAT CLOCK, I KNOW IT HAD TO GET CAUGHT ON AUDIO. I HOPE. - WHAT YOU GOT THERE? - THERMAL CAM. SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ROLLING ON THE CAM. THAT SETS A NICE BASELINE. IT KIND OF GIVES YOU THE DEGREES OF TEMPERATURE IN COLOR FORM. - RIGHT. ANY SPIKE IN THAT IS EASY TO DETECT. YEAH. SO LET'S GO AHEAD UP IN HERE, MAN. Marcus: ALL RIGHT. SO IT'S ME, JUWAN, AND BRAD, OUR GUEST INVESTIGATOR, ENTERING THE PLANER MILL. THIS IS, LIKE, ONE OF THE OLDEST AND MOST DANGEROUS PARTS OF THE PROPERTY. IT'S PRETTY SAFE TO ASSUME THAT PEOPLE WERE KILLED HERE. Juwan: YO, FELLAS, THIS ROOM WAS HUGE. I'M ABOUT TO CLIMB THESE STAIRS TO SEE IF I CAN GET A HIGHER VANTAGE POINT. Marcus: OKAY. SOME PRETTY STEEP STEPS UP THERE. THEY ARE. BUT, SERIOUSLY, HOW ABOUT WE ALL THROW OUT, LIKE, A STATEMENT TO THE WORKERS HERE AND SEE IF WE GET ANY TYPE OF FEEDBACK. - OKAY. - SOUNDS GOOD. IF YOU'RE A WORKER HERE AT THE PLANER, HOW WERE THE CONDITIONS? WERE YOU HAPPY LIVING ON THE PROPERTY? WAS IT A LOT OF COMPETITION FOR JOBS? WERE YOU KILLED FOR YOUR JOB? ARE YOU GETTING ANYTHING ON THE MEL METER? Brad: NOPE. THE MEL METER, EMF METER, DETECTING ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS IN THE AREA. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS JUST UNEXPLAINABLE SPIKES. WHAT WAS THAT? DID Y'ALL HEAR THAT? I DID. IT WAS, LIKE, TO THE LEFT OVER HERE. IT SOUNDED LIKE A THUMP OVER THERE, LIKE... - YEAH. - ...IN THE DISTANCE? YEAH, LET ME GO CHECK THAT OUT, BRO. HOLD ON, GUYS. HOLD ON. OH. GOT ABOUT A 5-DEGREE TEMPERATURE DROP, BUT THAT MAY BE THE OPEN AREA RIGHT HERE BRINGING IN SOME BREEZE. - YEAH. - SIX DEGREES. LIKE, RIGHT IN THIS AREA, RIGHT OVER HERE, HUH? RIGHT, 'CAUSE WE WERE AT 74 EARLIER. BUT THAT COULD HAVE ALSO BEEN, LIKE, THE WAY THE WIND IS ROLLING IN. YEAH, IT IS A LITTLE OPEN AREA RIGHT THERE. - YEAH. - BUT ALL OF THIS IS OPEN. - YEAH, TRUE. - I DON'T SEE WHY THE -- ONE LITTLE SPOT HAS IT'S OWN A/C UNIT. YEAH, OR THERE WOULD BE A GUST OF COOL BREEZE COMING THROUGH JUST ONE AREA. I SEE THESE ROCKING CHAIRS. DID Y'ALL TRY TO MOVE THEM AND SEE IF IT KIND OF DUPLICATED THAT SOUND? THAT WASN'T IT. IT WAS LIKE A THUD. WHAT WAS THAT? I THINK WE SHOULD DO ONE FINAL TEST. I THINK THAT FINAL TEST NEEDS TO BE US STANDING OVER THERE AND AIMING THE THERMAL CAM BACK IN THAT DIRECTION. - OKAY. AND SEE IF WE GET A VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE. MAYBE WE SHOULD DO IT FROM HERE? Marcus: YEAH. SO YOU WERE SAYING THAT IT WAS ABOUT 68 DEGREES OVER IN THIS AREA. YEAH, AND WHAT ARE WE GETTING NOW? 76. - 76 IN THIS SAME AREA. AND IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE IS 78, 79. I DON'T KNOW, GUYS. I THINK WE GOT TO HEAD BACK IN THERE. Dalen: I'M BACK. YOU SEXUALLY HARASSED ME EARLIER. LET YOUR PRESENCE BE KNOWN IF YOU'RE HERE. Dalen: THIS IS DALEN AND TRACY AT THE SAWMILL WHERE, EARLIER TODAY, I WAS TOUCHED ON THE BUTT. OH. DID YOU JUST TOUCH ME? - NO. - DID YOU JUST TOUCH ME? - HANDS IN MY POCKETS. THIS IS THE BUILDING WHERE A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY DIED. IT'S BELIEVED THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY PUSHED TO HIS DEATH BECAUSE JEALOUS CO-WORKERS WANTED HIS JOB. CLAIMS FROM THE SAWMILL INCLUDE TOUCHING, OBVIOUSLY, DISEMBODIED VOICES, AND APPARITIONS. Dalen: WHERE DO YOU SUGGEST THAT WE SET UP THE REM-POD? WE COULD DO IT RIGHT IN THE AREA WHERE THE BOY FELL. THAT WOULD BE GOOD. - YOU SAID PEOPLE ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THEY WERE TOUCHED IN THAT AREA, RIGHT? - YES. - SO THIS IS THE AREA... - JUST SET IT RIGHT OVER THERE. - ...WHERE SOMEONE TOUCHED ME. I'M GONNA PUT IT RIGHT HERE AT THE EDGE. WHOEVER TOUCHED MY BUTT EARLIER, ARE YOU HERE NOW? Tracy: HE WANTS YOU TO DO IT AGAIN. I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO IT AGAIN. I WOULD MUCH RATHER YOU JUST MAKE YOUR PRESENCE KNOWN THROUGH THE REM-POD. DO IT TO ME SO I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE. TRACY'S A FREAK. ARE YOU THE PERSON THAT DIED IN THIS ROOM? DID YOU FALL IN, OR WERE YOU PUSHED? ARE WE WELCOMED HERE? LOOK, MAN. I'M STARTING TO GET FRUSTRATED NOW. SAY SOMETHING. DO SOMETHING. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT COOL? TOUCHING MY BUTT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. - THERE WE GO. - THERE IT IS. Dalen: LOOK, MAN. YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT COOL? TOUCHING MY BUTT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. - THERE WE GO. - THERE IT IS. IT LIT UP. IT LIT, AND IT MADE JUST A LITTLE QUICK BURST. WHAT ABOUT MY BUTT MADE Y'ALL WANT TO TOUCH IT? WAS I STARTING TO EXCITE YOU? DO YOU LIKE MEN? IS THAT WHY YOU'RE TOUCHING MEN'S BUTTS? THAT'S OKAY. IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS IN THE 1800s OR THE EARLY 1900s. IF THAT'S YOUR THING, LET IT BE KNOWN. WHATEVER IS YOUR FLAVOR. YOU LIKE CRACKERS? HEY, MAN. TRACY SAID THAT, NOT ME, MAN. WE'RE REALLY NOT GETTING ANY RESPONSES THROUGH THE REM-POD, BUT I'M DEFINITELY NOT READY TO GIVE UP ON THIS LOCATION. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MY PHONE. I'M GONNA PUT THE FLASH ON. AND YOU CAN JUST TAKE A COUPLE PICTURES OF ME, AND THEN WE CAN SEE IF WE CATCH ANYTHING. LET'S JUST TAKE MAYBE ONE OR TWO PICTURES TO SEE. Tracy: ONE OR TWO? THERE'S ONE. Dalen: OH, IT'S MY O.G. POSE. MY O.G. POSE. WHERE'S -- I DON'T EVEN SEE YOU, SO I'M JUST SHOOTING. OKAY. - OKAY. NOW LET'S SEE IF WE CAUGHT SOMETHING. Dalen: DO YOU SEE ANYTHING KIND OF AWKWARD IN THIS PHOTO? Tracy: OTHER THAN YOU? OTHER THAN THAT HANDSOME, STRIKING GUY. IS THERE A SHADOW RIGHT BEHIND... I MEAN. - THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING AT. THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING AT. THAT'S HARD. THAT'S HARD TO TELL. IT'S LIKE IT'S SOME TYPE OF FIGURE RIGHT HERE. YEAH. BUT IT'S NOT IN THIS PICTURE, LOOK. THAT'S THE SAME SPACE. - IT'S THE SAME SPACE BUT -- - SAME SPACE, NOTHING THERE. - YEAH, NOTHING. BUT THERE YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING, LIKE, HOVERING. YEAH. BRO, WHATEVER IT WAS WE CAUGHT IN THAT FIRST PICTURE WAS DEFINITELY NOT IN THE SECOND ONE. AND NOT JUST THAT, IT LOOKS LIKE IT APPEARED IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT AS THAT APPARITION THAT WAS IN THAT PICTURE THAT WAS SHOWED TO US EARLIER TODAY. MAN, TRACY, I'M PROUD, MAN. GIVE ME A HIGH FIVE, MAN. GOOD JOB, TRACY, FOR SURE. YEAH, LET'S KEEP PROVOKING THAT ONE THAT GROPED YOU. AND IT SEEMS TO BE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE 16-YEAR-OLD. WE MAY GOT TO STOP MENTIONING ME GETTING GROPED IN HERE, MAN... - OKAY. ...BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I GOT A REPUTATION TO KEEP UP, MAN. - OKAY. - YEAH. GOT TO HAVE SOME STREET CRED. ♪♪ Marcus: SO, AS DALEN AND TRACY CONTINUE THEIR INVESTIGATION AT THE SAWMILL, WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE SKIDDER... YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. THE CLYDE SKIDDER. ...WHERE WE'VE HAD STORIES OF DEAD MAN... STOKES. HE WAS THE CAUSE OF MANY DEATHS. HE WAS VERY RECKLESS WITH HOW HE DID HIS JOB. [ MAN SCREAMS ] AND NOW WE'RE GONNA GO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME TYPE OF CONTACT ON OVER THERE. THERE'S A LOT OF BUGS OVER HERE. I'M JUST GONNA BE HONEST. - OH. - HEARD THAT? Brad: SOMETHING RUNNING. IT'S ABOUT TO BE ME RUNNING. NOW, GRANTED, YOU DO HAVE LOTS OF WILDLIFE OUT HERE. WHAT KIND OF WILDLIFE DO YOU THINK THERE WAS OUT HERE IN LOUISIANA? - COYOTES. - RACCOONS? RACCOONS, PLENTY OF RACCOONS. THAT'S SOME GOOD EATING. YOU EVER ATE THAT? - OH, NO. THAT'S SOME GOOD EATING. Marcus: I HAVEN'T HAD THE PLEASURE. EATING RACCOONS, MAN, I'M FROM GEORGIA, BUT, BRUH, NOT THAT PART. SO, THIS WHERE DEAD MAN STOKES HAD MOST OF HIS MISCHIEF. - CHECK THIS OUT. - OH, SNAP. THIS IS THE WIRE THAT WOULD HAVE LIKE, SNAPPED AND PROBABLY SEVERED YOU. SO YOU IMAGINE THESE FLYING AT YOU PROBABLY 60 TO 70 MILES AN HOUR. I MEAN, IT WOULD SLICE RIGHT THROUGH YOU. - WOW. - MM. LET'S TRY TO MAKE CONTACT WITH DEAD MAN STOKES OR ANY OF THOSE WHO DIED HERE WHILE WORKING WITH HIM. DEAD MAN STOKES, ARE YOU OUT HERE PROTECTING YOUR OLD WORKING MACHINE? WERE YOU TIRED OF YOUR JOB AND INTENTIONALLY KILLED PEOPLE? Marcus: WERE YOU EVEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONE'S DEATH? WERE THESE DEATHS MALICIOUS OR JUST OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD? ALL RIGHT. LET'S RUN THAT BACK. WERE YOU EVEN RESPONSIBLE FOR ANYONE'S DEATH? [ WHOOSH ] - WERE THESE DEATHS... - HEAR THAT HOWL BEFORE? ...MALICIOUS OR JUST OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD? - LET'S HEAR IT ONE MORE TIME. - ...FOR ANYONE'S DEATH? [ WHOOSH ] - WERE THESE DEATHS -- - DID YOU HEAR IT? LIKE, YOU HEAR IT'S LIKE, "HOO." WERE THESE DEATHS... COULD HAVE BEEN A REAL RESPONSE. WE DO KNOW THAT THIS IS WHERE DEAD MAN STOKES HAD HIS DEAD MAN STOKESNESS GOING ON, SO THAT COULD BE A RESPONSE. IT DID OCCUR RIGHT AFTER HE HAD ASKED THE QUESTION, TOO. - YEAH. - DALEN: Hey, man. Some crazy stuff happen to y'all over there? WE GOT A COUPLE OF THINGS HAPPEN THAT KIND OF SUGGESTED a manifestation going on. WE CAUGHT SOME CRAZY STUFF IN THE MACHINE SHOP, MAN. WHERE Y'ALL AT, MAN? LET'S MEET UP. WE'RE OVER BY THE SKIDDER. HEY, WE'RE GONNA MEET YOU AT THE SPOT, THOUGH, ALL RIGHT? THAT'S PERFECT, GUYS. MEET YOU THERE IN A FLASH, YOU KNOW. - AND A HALF. - AND A HALF. - AND A HALF. - That's Tracy's joke. He's the only one that laughed. - [ LAUGHS ] IT'S LIKE, WHAT'S A SMIDGEN?

I THINK THEY'RE COWARDS. MAKE IT GO OFF IF YOU WANT US TO LEAVE. WOW. Tracy: OKAY, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE. YOU TOLD US YOU WANTED US OUT.

OH **** - OH, THIS IS GETTING CRAZY. THAT WAS GREAT. I LOVED THAT. Dalen: WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE LONGLEAF SAWMILL IN LONGLEAF, LOUISIANA. A LOT OF WORKERS LIVED AND DIED HERE BACK IN THE DAY AT THE SAWMILL. THIS WAS MOSTLY DUE TO MURDERS PERPETRATED BY CO-WORKERS WHO WAS JUST LOOKING FOR AN EASY COME-UP, OR THEY WANTED TO KNOCK OFF THEIR RIVALS. THE GUYS AND MYSELF HAVE EXPERIENCED A LOT OF ACTIVITY WITH TRACY AND BRAD, BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO GET BACK TO WHAT WE KNOW BEST, AND THAT'S THE BROS. AND LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND. YOU KNOW WHAT? SPEAKING OF INVESTIGATING, WE GOT A COUPLE MORE HOURS TO HANDLE HERE... DO IT. ...SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU GUYS COMING OUT. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. - YEAH. IT'S TIME FOR US TO GET BACK TO IT SO WE CAN FIND OUT WHO'S REALLY HAUNTING THE SAWMILL. LET'S GO HIT THIS GENERATOR ROOM WHERE BRANDON HEARD THE STEPS FROM. - HIT IT, BRO. LET'S GO. - ALL RIGHT. COOL. YOU AIN'T GONNA TELL US TO BUCKLE UP FIRST? - THERE AREN'T NO SEATBELTS. - OH, MY GOD. - GOT A LITTLE KICK TO IT. - HEY, MAN, SLOW DOWN, MAN. YOU ABOUT TO MAKE ME DROP THIS EMF DETECTOR. OH, OUCH. HEY, MAN, I AIN'T TRYING TO FALL OUT THIS THING, BRO. - SHUT YOUR ASS UP. - OKAY. BRO, Y'ALL WOULDN'T EVEN SEE ME IF I FELL OUT. - NO, WE WOULDN'T. - AND THAT'S WHAT'S SAD. ALL RIGHT, BROTHERS. Juwan: YEAH, THIS IS THE GENERATOR ROOM, RIGHT? - AKA GEN-POP. - YEAH. THIS IS WHERE BRANDON SAID HE HEARD FOOTSTEPS. I DON'T KNOW, BRO. THIS WHOLE AREA JUST SEEMS DEMONIC. THAT'S A GOOD WORD TO USE. LIKE, WHY YOU WOULD YOU EVEN BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THIS? LIKE THIS. IT PROBABLY DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THIS WHEN THEY BUILT IT, THOUGH. SO WHOEVER'S IN HERE, I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR SOME FOOTSTEPS. WE WOULD LOVE TO HEAR SOME FOOTSTEPS SINCE YOU TOUGH LIKE THAT, HOMEY. YOU WANT TO RUN AN EVP REAL QUICK? - WE CAN. - YEP. IF ANYONE'S IN HERE WITH US, FEEL FREE... TO MAKE A NOISE, MAKE A SOUND, WALK, TOUCH SOMETHING. ANNOUNCE YOURSELF. WE KNOW THIS WAS A DANGEROUS LOCATION AT THE MILL AND ACCIDENTS HAPPEN, BUT DID YOU DIE WORKING IN THIS ROOM? ARE YOU THE SPIRIT THAT WALKED TOWARDS BRANDON AND SCARED HIM? Brandon: AND THEN WE ACTUALLY HEARD THE FOOTSTEPS COME DOWN THE STAIRWAY. AS WE'RE SITTING THERE, WE START HEARING THE FOOTSTEPS COMING TOWARDS US. Marcus: ARE YOU AGGRESSIVE BECAUSE YOU WERE MURDERED IN THE GENERATOR ROOM? IS THERE SOMEONE IN HERE WITH US NOW? WAIT. DID Y'ALL HEAR THAT? [ LAUGHS ] IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS FROM OUTSIDE. - NO. - IT SOUNDED LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING UP THERE IN THAT CORNER. I WONDER IF I CAUGHT THAT ON THE SPEAKER. - I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE. - HOLD ON, LET ME HEAR. BECAUSE THAT WAS LITERALLY RIGHT AFTER YOU SAID SOMETHING. LET ME SEE. IS THERE SOMEONE IN HERE WITH US NOW? [ TAPPING ] DID Y'ALL HEAR THAT? YOU COULD HEAR, LIKE, A STEP. LISTEN TO THIS. IS THERE SOMEONE IN HERE WITH US NOW? [ TAPPING ] DID Y'ALL HEAR THAT? YOU CAN KIND OF HEAR, LIKE, A STEP, A FOOTSTEP. I'M NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING, IS JUST, LIKE... - CONCRETE. - ...CONCRETE. BUT THERE IS SOME TYPE OF... A REMNANTS OF SOMETHING TRYING TO MANIFEST ITSELF. DEFINITELY. - HMM. YOU KNOW. HEY, MAN, THIS IS WHERE THEY SAY BUDDY IS REAL AGGRESSIVE. MAYBE WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT AGGRESSIVE. HE A PUNK? IF YOU'RE HERE, MAKE A NOISE. NOW WE'RE IN HERE TRYING TO ANTAGONIZE THE SPIRIT, LIKE, "COME ON. IF YOU'RE GONNA BE TOUGH, BE TOUGH." IS HE A PUNK? SAY WHAT UP. [ BANG ] - OH **** HEY, MAN, THIS IS WHERE THEY SAY BUDDY IS REAL AGGRESSIVE. MAYBE WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT AGGRESSIVE. HE A PUNK? NOW WE'RE IN HERE TRYING TO ANTAGONIZE THE SPIRIT, LIKE, "COME ON.

Dalen: BRO, SOMETHING JUST SNAPPED IN HERE. HELLO? I DON'T KNOW, MAN. I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S SOMETHING BACK IN THAT. - THAT IS BACK THERE. - IT'S BACK THERE. IF YOU'RE IN HERE, MAKE THAT NOISE ONE MORE TIME. HELLO? SO I CHECK BACK HERE, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. SO ONLY THING THAT'S BUMPING IN THE NIGHT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S IN HERE THAT WE CANNOT SEE. Dalen: WELL, GUYS, I MEAN, SOMETHING DEFINITELY STIRRED UP THE SPIRIT OF THAT BOY. BUT IT'S NOT VERY TALKATIVE. LIKE, I'M GETTING THE FEELING THAT HE REALLY DON'T EVEN WANT US IN HERE. DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD GO CHECK OUT THE SAWMILL? YEAH, THAT WAY WE CAN USE THE REMOTE CONTROL CAR TOO. ALL RIGHT. SO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE'RE ABOUT TO GO INTO THE SAWMILL. WE HAVE THE CAR. WE CALL THIS THE GHOST WHIP 4,000. IT HAS AN I.R. CAM ON IT, SO THE SPOTS THAT WE CAN'T GET TO, WE CAN PUT THIS DOWN THERE. WE'RE GONNA DRIVE IT DOWN INTO THAT GRINDER PIT. SO I'M GONNA LOWER IT DOWN WITH THIS ROPE. - SEE WHAT WE CAN SEE. - WE GOT A PLAN. EARLIER TODAY, DALEN WAS TOUCHED BY SOMETHING. FELT LIKE SOMEBODY PUT THEY WHOLE HAND ON MY LEFT CHEEK. WE ASSUME THAT IT'S THE 16-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO WAS PUSHED TO HIS DEATH THAT WORKED HERE AT THE SAWMILL. I REALLY WANT TO INVESTIGATE THAT SPACE USING OUR GHOST WHIP. I THINK IT'S GONNA REALLY TRIGGER THE 16-YEAR-OLD. I MEAN, IF I WAS A KID, I WOULD WANT TO GET THE GHOST WHIP OUT. WITH THIS PIT BEING SO DEEP, WE KNOW THAT WE CAN'T JUMP DOWN THERE. SO WE MIGHT AS WELL GO AHEAD AND PUT OUR NICE LITTLE FRIEND. SO GO AHEAD, BRO. SO WITH THIS I.R. CAM, PRETTY MUCH WE CAN CATCH IF THERE'S ANY, LIKE, SHADOW FIGURES OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE. WE'RE DOWN, RIGHT? - YEP. - HOLD ON, HOLD ON. - I'M ON MY SIDE. Juwan: OH. THAT'S WHY I HAD TO PUT THIS ROPE ON HERE, MAN, 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T TRUST MARCUS' DRIVING ABILITIES. Marcus: THUGGIN'. THUGGIN'. I'M A GREAT DRIVER. OKAY, RAN INTO A WALL AGAIN. THIS IS THE SPOT WHERE YOU DIED. ARE YOU HERE WITH US? DO YOU LIKE OUR CAR? WHAT'S YOUR NAME? IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT WANTS TO TALK. Dalen: HEY, HEY, Y'ALL BE QUIET REAL QUICK, MAN. WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO, BE QUIET? ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL PLAYING. IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING WALKING OVER THERE TOWARDS Y'ALL. - WHAT? - EXACTLY. BE QUIET. Y'ALL DON'T HEAR IT? Y'ALL REALLY DON'T HEAR THAT OVER THERE WALKING THAT WAY? NO. [ SCRATCHING ] - I KNOW Y'ALL HEARD THAT. - I DID. - YEAH, I DID HEAR THAT. BRO, THERE'S SOMETHING RIGHT BY THAT DOOR. Shh. WHAT WOULD BRING A 16-YEAR-OLD OUT? WE GOT GIRLS. AH, I KNOW WHAT IT IS. YOU REMEMBER HIM POKING YOU. - RIGHT. - HE POKED YOUR POCKET, HOMEY. HE WAS TRYING TO POCKET CHECK ME. BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO GET THAT LAST CHECK. - HE'S TRYING TO GET THAT MONEY. - WRITE HIM A CHECK. FROM THE BANK OF GHOST BROTHERS? SEE, LISTEN, YOU JUST SIGN UP AT THE BANK OF GHOST BROTHERS. NO CREDIT, ANY CREDIT. AND YOU GET YOUR STUFF RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, NOW LISTEN. WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU THIS CHECK FOR ABOUT $12? WHOA. 12 WHOLE DOLLARS? OKAY, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE YOU THIS CHECK FOR $3. THAT'S ABOUT A WHOLE WEEK WORTH OF PAY. SOMEBODY BETTER WRITE THEIR NAME ON THIS CHECK. SO COME OUT, WHOEVER WANTS IT. THAT'S A GIFT FROM US TO Y'ALL. LET THEM FIGHT OVER THAT LITTLE $3 'CAUSE IT AIN'T NOTHING TO A BALLER. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY FIGHT OVER MONEY, MAN, SOMEBODY END UP DEAD. THAT'S WHY WE LEAVING RIGHT NOW. THERE ARE DEFINITELY MULTIPLE SPIRITS HERE AT THE SAWMILL. BUT, FOR WHATEVER REASON, THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK TO US. BUT THAT'S COOL. WE CAN CATCH A HINT. SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND BOUNCE, BUT BEFORE WE DO, WE GONNA LEAVE THIS LITTLE CHECK AND HOPEFULLY, MAN, THAT APPEASES SOME OF THE SPIRITS THAT, YOU KNOW, MIGHT HAVE GOT SHORTED BACK IN THE DAY.

AFTER ALL THE ACTIVITY THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED HERE TONIGHT WHEN ASKING THE SPIRITS IF THEY WERE MURDERED, WE FEEL FOR SURE THAT THESE SPIRITS THAT WERE KILLED AT THE JOB ARE STILL HOLDING ONTO THEIR GRUDGE AND STILL HAUNTING THE LONGLEAF SAWMILL. BUT ANY SPIRIT THAT IS HERE, DO NOT FOLLOW US HOME. YEAH, Y'ALL CAN'T COME. HEY, I GOT ANY EARLY DAY IN THE MORNING, MAN. ♪ GHOSTING OUT ♪
