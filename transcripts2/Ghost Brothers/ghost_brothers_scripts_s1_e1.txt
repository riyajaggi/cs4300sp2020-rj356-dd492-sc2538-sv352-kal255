 IT'S JUST WIRES AND COBWEBS, HOMIE. Dalen: YOU ARE NOT WELCOMED ON THIS PROPERTY. OUR MISSION IS TO HIT THE MOST HAUNTED LOCATIONS IN AMERICA TO PROVE THAT GHOSTS ARE FOR REAL. [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] WE ARE... All: ...THE GHOST BROTHERS. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS - WHAT'S GOING ON, BROTHER? - WHAT'S UP, FELLAS? WHEN I'M NOT HUNTING GHOSTS, MY DAY JOB JUST SO HAPPENS TO BE A BARBER. AND DALEN AND JUWAN KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME WHEN A NEW CASE POPS UP. - MAN, THIS ONE HERE... - MM-HMM. ...THIS ONE HAS A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING, FELLAS. - WORD. - YEAH, MAN. - WHAT DO WE GOT? - THE MAGNOLIA PLANTATION IN DAIRY, LOUISIANA. THIS IS THE KICKER. THE SLAVES, LIKE, THEY WERE PRACTICING VOODOO TO, LIKE, PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THE WHITE MASTERS. - LIKE, VOODOO DOLLS AND STUFF? - VOODOO, BRO. Dalen: THE MAGNOLIA PLANTATION DATES BACK TO THE EARLY 1800s WHEN IT WAS A COTTON FARM WITH OVER 100 SLAVES. A RECENT EXCAVATION BY AN ARCHAEOLOGIST UNEARTHED A BUNCH OF VOODOO ARTIFACTS AROUND THE PROPERTY BURIED IN THE LATE 1800s BY A CONJURER NAMED AUNT AGNES, A FORMER SLAVE WHO LIVED IN THE SLAVE QUARTERS UNTIL HER DEATH IN THE 1920s. I'M BELIEVING THAT AUNT AGNES COULDN'T BE HAPPY WITH SOMEBODY JUST, LIKE, DIGGING UP THE STUFF THAT SHE SET TO PROTECT EVERYBODY WITH. MY AUNTIE WOULDN'T BE HAPPY. SHOOT, MY AUNTIE DON'T PLAY THEM GAMES. EVER SINCE THEN, LIKE, IT'S BEEN, LIKE, CRACKING ON THAT PLANTATION. WORD. THERE ARE A TON OF CLAIMS. PEOPLE REPORT SEEING FULL-BODIED APPARITIONS, SHADOWS AND HEARING WHISPERS AND BANGING THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. IT'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT CLAIMS ON THIS PLANTATION, MAN. - WORD. - I THINK WE SHOULD PROBABLY REACH OUT TO THIS GUY NAMED JOE GIBBONS. WE TALKED TO JOE, A VISITOR TO THE PLANTATION WHO HAD AN ENCOUNTER ON THE GROUNDS. - WHAT? - WHAT? Dalen: AND HE'S GONNA MEET US AT THE PROPERTY. YOU, TOO, JOE. WE'LL ALSO MEET UP WITH ARCHAEOLOGIST KEN BROWN AND FIND OUT IF HIS EXCAVATION OF THE PLANTATION OPENED UP A PANDORA'S BOX TO THE PARANORMAL. LOUISIANA, RIGHT? - GOOD OL' LOUISIANA. - GOOD OL' LOUISIANA. HEY, I WONDER IF WE CAN GET US SOME GUMBO. YOU KNOW WE GETTING SOME GUMBO. TIME TO START GHOSTING. SO, WE'RE HEADED TO THE MAGNOLIA PLANTATION NOW TO MEET DR. KEN BROWN, MAN, THE ARCHAEOLOGIST THAT FOUND VOODOO ARTIFACTS. THE ONLY REFERENCE I KNOW ABOUT VOODOO IS... THAT'S HOW YOU CURE SYPHILIS. - WHAT? - WAIT, HOLD UP A SECOND. I GOT TO ASK, KEN, "HOW DO YOU CURE SYPHILIS?" WAIT, WHAT? WHY DO YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM THAT? THAT'S LIKE EVERY DOCTOR NEEDS TO KNOW TO CURE SYPHILIS. - ABSOLUTELY. - DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING. OH, DON'T THINK DR. PHIL EXCLUDED. **** OH, MY GOD. Dalen: CLEARLY, WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT VOODOO, BUT WE DO KNOW ABOUT GHOSTS. AND I'M PRETTY SURE MESSING AROUND WITH THEIR VOODOO ARTIFACTS IS A DAMN GOOD WAY TO MAKE 'EM MAD. YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT ALL THE TIME LIKE IN EGYPT WHEN, LIKE, THESE ARCHAEOLOGISTS START OPENING UP THESE TOMBS AND STUFF AND RELEASE ALL THESE SPIRITS. THAT'S HOW -- THAT'S HOW "MUMMY RETURN" STARTED. THAT'S EXACTLY HOW THAT MOVIE STARTED. THEN THAT MESSED UP THE WHOLE EGYPT. THAT WAS A WHOLE DEMON RELEASE. I HOPE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THIS HOUSE. THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. OH, MY GOD. LOOK AT THOSE QUARTERS. I SMELL VOODOO IN THERE. I SMELL IT IN THERE. Dalen: THIS PROPERTY GOES WAY BACK TO 1753 WHEN IT WAS PURCHASED BY JEAN-BAPTISTE LE COMTE AND TURNED INTO A COTTON PLANTATION. IN 1830, BUILDINGS WERE CONSTRUCTED ON THE PROPERTY AND IT BECAME KNOWN AS MAGNOLIA PLANTATION, WHERE HUNDREDS OF HIS SLAVE PEOPLE LABORED. HAVING SURVIVED THE CIVIL WAR, THE PLANTATION'S MAIN HOUSE, OVERSEER'S HOME AND SLAVE QUARTERS HAVE STOOD FOR GENERATIONS. IF THE SPIRITS OF ANY OF ITS FORMER INHABITANTS ARE TRAPPED HERE, I GET THE FEELING THEY PROBABLY STILL AREN'T GETTING ALONG. Juwan: I'LL BE DAMNED IF I WALK THESE GROUNDS BY MYSELF. HEY, DR. BROWN. HOW'S IT GOING? HEY. DR. BROWN. - HOW YOU DOING? - HEY, HOW YOU DOING? - NICE TO SEE YOU. - IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. - HOW YOU DOING? - DOING FINE. Ken: YOU'RE OUT HERE IN THE SLAVE QUARTERS. THEY WERE BUILT AROUND THE 1840s. Marcus: THIS IS THE ONE THAT YOU ACTUALLY FOUND THE ARTIFACTS IN? THIS IS ONE OF THREE, BUT THIS IS THE MAIN ONE. WE LITERALLY EXCAVATED BELOW INTO THE FOOTPRINT OF THE CABIN. THAT SOUTH ROOM WAS WHERE THE MIDWIFE WORKED, AUNT AGNES. - OKAY. AND SHE WAS ALSO A CONJURER. Dalen: SO, TO BE A CONJURER, DOES THAT FALL UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF VOODOO OR... OH, YES. IT'S A RELIGION. DR. BROWN TELLS US THAT AUNT AGNES HELD A SPECIAL STATUS AS A RELIGIOUS LEADER IN THE SLAVE QUARTERS. THE VOODOO CONJURER MADE MEDICINES AND CHARMS AND BURIED THEM FOR PROTECTION. PARANORMAL CLAIMS IN AUNT AGNES' CABIN INCLUDE SHADOW FIGURES AND WHISPERS. WITH THE EXCAVATING YOU DID, DO YOU THINK THAT MAY HAVE STIRRED UP SOME ACTIVITY? IT COULD HAVE. DO YOU FEEL LIKE HER SPIRIT IS STILL HERE? THERE ARE TIMES I'VE FELT LIKE JUST SOMEBODY WAS LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT A CONJURER DOES. - OKAY. - SO... OUR CAMERA LIGHTS START TO GO CRAZY WHEN WE ASK IF AUNT AGNES IS STILL HERE. THE AFRICAN AND... IT'S AUNT AGNES. AUNT AGNES IS PISSED OFF. MAN, THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS PISS OFF A VOODOO CONJURER BEFORE WE EVEN START OUR INVESTIGATION, SO WE'RE GONNA RESPECT THAT, GIVE HER SOME SPACE, AND JUST TRY AGAIN TONIGHT. MUCH OF THIS PROPERTY IS CARED FOR BY THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE. SO, WE'RE MEETING UP WITH PARK RANGER DUSTIN... WE ARE HERE. ...TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PLANTATION'S AREAS AND CLAIMS. THE BLACKSMITH OF A PLANTATION, THEY WERE ALSO, UH, SPIRITUAL AND RELIGIOUS LEADERS IN THE COMMUNITY. DUSTIN TELLS US THAT AT THE BLACKSMITH SHOP, THERE ARE CLAIMS OF PEOPLE HEARING METAL BANGING AND DISEMBODIED VOICES. THE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS ALL THE FOLKS THAT LIVED HERE. THE LANGUAGE THEY WOULD'VE BEEN SPEAKING WAS LOUISIANA FRENCH. I'M GONNA SAY, "MY NAME IS DALEN," SO THAT'S... MON NOM EST DALEN. MON NOM EST DALEN. EST CORRECT. IF I WANT TO TALK TO MY WIFE, HOW DO YOU SAY CHRISTINA IN -- IN, UH... HOW DO YOU SAY CHRISTINA IN FRENCH? IS THAT -- IS THAT DUMB TO ASK? OKAY. OKAY. THE FRENCH LANGUAGE, IT'S LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS BORN IN ME. I CAN GET THIS ON ROSETTA STONE. THAT WOULD BE COOL, RIGHT? THAT WOULD BE COOL, MAN. Dalen: THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DEATHS ON THE PROPERTY. THE MOST MYSTERIOUS OCCURRED IN THE GIN BARN, WHICH HOUSED THE PLANTATION'S COTTON GIN. HERE, PEOPLE REPORT SEEING SHADOW FIGURES AND HEARING FOOTSTEPS. Dustin: DURING THE PERIOD OF SLAVERY, THERE IS AN ACCOUNT THAT A YOUNG MAN DIED IN THE GIN, AND, REALLY, THE ACCOUNT IS VERY VAGUE. ALL IT SAYS IS THAT HE BURNED UP IN THE GIN. WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT IT, THOUGH. IT'S JUST A REALLY GENERAL ACCOUNT THAT YOU FIND WRITTEN IN AN OVERSEER'S LEDGER. Dalen: THE OVERSEER, MR. MILLER, WAS IN CHARGE OF THE SLAVES AROUND THE CIVIL WAR TIME. AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS, DUDE WAS A **** SO, IT'S A BIT OF KARMIC JUSTICE THAT HE ALSO DIED A VIOLENT DEATH. THE LEGEND OF MR. MILLER, DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN APRIL OF 1864, UNION TROOPS WERE PASSING THROUGH THIS AREA, AND SOME KIND OF ALTERCATION TOOK PLACE. AND THE STORY IS THAT THE UNION TROOPS SHOT AND FATALLY KILLED MR. MILLER AND BURIED HIM SOMEWHERE IN THE AREA OF THE FRONT YARD AROUND THE MAIN HOUSE. GEEZ. Dalen: THE PRESENCE OF THE OVERSEER STILL LOOMS LARGE AT THE MAGNOLIA PLANTATION. AND IT WAS AT THE OVERSEER'S OWN HOUSE THAT OUR WITNESS, JOE, AN AMATEUR PARANORMAL ENTHUSIAST HAD A LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE. Joe: MY WIFE AND I, AS WE WERE WALKING AROUND THE CORNER RIGHT HERE, I LOOKED OFF TO THE RIGHT AND THERE WAS A MAN THERE IN PERIOD DRESS SCREAMING AND HOLLERING AT ME, TRYING TO GET MY ATTENTION. AND THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK'S STANDING UP. AFTER THAT, ACTUALLY CHANGED MY LIFE FROM BEING THE WORLD'S BIGGEST SKEPTIC TO SOMEONE NOW THAT SAYS, "HEY, MAN, THERE -- THERE'S SOMETHING OUT THERE WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT." - YOU NEVER WOULD'VE THOUGHT... I'D HAVE PUT A BENJAMIN IN YOUR HAND AND SAID, "OKAY." YOU STILL GOT THAT BENJAMIN? NO, I DON'T HAVE IT WITH ME RIGHT NOW. OKAY. JUST MAKING SURE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PASS THOSE OUT, I WOULD... NOW, MNH-MNH, IT STAYS IN MY POCKET. YOU JUST TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT. HE JUST TOLD ME HE DIDN'T HAVE A BENJAMIN, THOUGH. YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK, THOUGH? WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING SOME INVESTIGATING LATER TONIGHT. WE WOULD BE HONORED IF YOU'D JOIN US. - I'D LOVE TO GO, MAN. - THERE IT IS. - WOO-WEE. - I RESPECT JOE. I'M EXCITED TO GET HIM OUT HERE TONIGHT, AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN USE HIM AS A TRIGGER OBJECT. SINCE JOE HAS ALREADY HAD AN ENCOUNTER AT THE OVERSEER'S HOUSE, HAVING HIM WITH US MIGHT TRIGGER THE SPIRIT TO MAKE ANOTHER APPEARANCE. HEY, FELLAS. LISTEN. - WHAT'S THAT, BRUH BRUH? - IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME. NIGHT TIME? NO, TIME TO POP THE TRUNK ON THESE GHOSTS! YEAH. HEY, LET'S GET TO IT, BROTHER. HERE WE GO. OH, I GOT SOME GOOD STUFF TODAY. GOT YOUR LASER GRID. - OH, YEAH. - JUWAN, HERE'S YOURS. - LET ME GET THAT. HERE YOU GO. OVER THE YEARS, WE'VE TRIED A LOT OF PARANORMAL TOOLS ON THE MARKET. BUT FOR US, THE SIMPLEST TOOLS ARE THE MOST RELIABLE ONES. IF YOU SEE A SHADOW WHILE HOLDING A LASER GRID PEN... OH, IT'S REAL. GOT A CAMERA FOR YOU. I.R. CAMERAS ARE NOT ONLY GREAT FOR DOCUMENTING, BUT THEY ALSO HELP US SEE IN THE DARK. I'M GONNA TAKE THE, UH, REM-POD. THE GOOD OLD REM-POD HAS BECOME, LIKE, A FAVORITE OF OURS OVER THE YEARS. AND TONIGHT, WE'RE GONNA USE IT TO TRY TO MAKE CONTACT WITH AUNT AGNES. BUT MOSTLY, WE'LL BE USING OUR GOOD OLD SMARTPHONES AS AN EVP RECORDING DEVICE AND A THERMAL CAM. WELL, LET'S GO, FELLAS. WE GOT A LOT OF GROUND TO COVER AT THIS PLANTATION, SO WE MIGHT AS WELL GET THIS NIGHT STARTED. - LET'S ROLL. - LET'S GET IT, BRUH. TO INVESTIGATE THIS MASSIVE PROPERTY, WE NEED TO SPLIT UP. JUWAN IS GONNA MEET UP WITH OUR WITNESS, JOE, AND HEAD ON OVER TO THE OVERSEER'S HOUSE. AND ME AND MARCUS, WE'RE GONNA HEAD DOWN TO THE GIN BARN. WATCH YOUR STEP. WATCH YOUR STEP. THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE CLAIMS OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN BEING BURNED TO DEATH. SO, LET'S GET IN HERE AND SEE WHAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY WE MIGHT COME ACROSS. IF THIS AIN'T THE CREEPIEST GIN BARN I'VE EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE. 'CAUSE YOU BEEN IN A COUPLE OF THEM? NO, I HAVEN'T BEEN IN ANY, BUT THIS IS PROBABLY THE SCARIEST ONE. WE HAVE CLAIMS OF BLACK MASSES HERE, KIDS LAUGHING. KIND OF JUST HAS THIS REAL EERIE FEELING LIKE WE'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES IN HERE. HOW'S IT LOOKING IN I.R.? Dalen: DUDE. SO, WHAT, LIKE, YOU SEE SOMETHING UP THERE? IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS A FIGURE. OH, MY GOD. Dalen: DUDE. IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS A FIGURE. SO, WHAT, LIKE, YOU SEE SOMETHING UP THERE? - I HAD THE CAMERA DOWN... - MM-HMM. IT PANNED UP, HIT THE DOOR. IT LITERALLY LOOKED LIKE THE SHADOW OF A MAN STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOOR FRAME WITH HIS ARMS LIKE -- LIKE THIS. THERE HAS BEEN CLAIMS OF DARK MASSES IN HERE, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING, SO... IT'S SOMETHING UP THERE. YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE THE LITTLE BOY? THAT MIGHT BE THE BLACK MASS THAT EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT. THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT. Dalen: I'M GONNA USE AN AUDIO APP ON MY PHONE TO RECORD AN ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENON SESSION, OR AN EVP, SO WE CAN HOPEFULLY CAPTURE ANY SPIRIT VOICES PRESENT. ARE YOU THE LITTLE BOY THAT PASSED AWAY HERE YEARS AGO? WAS THAT YOU WHO I SAW STANDING IN THE DOOR FRAME? ARE YOU THE LITTLE BOY THAT PASSED AWAY HERE YEARS AGO? Man: NO. - YOU HEAR THAT? - MM-HMM. - HUH? - I HEARD... DID YOU HEAR THAT? - DAWG... - WHAT DID IT SAY? REWIND THAT, BROTHER. OH, MY GOSH, DAWG. YO, I'M TRYING TO LAUGH WITHOUT RUNNING RIGHT NOW. NO, I FEEL YOU, BRO. - LIKE, THIS IS, UM... - NO, HOLD ON. LISTEN, THOUGH. LISTEN. ARE YOU THE LITTLE BOY THAT PASSED AWAY HERE YEARS AGO? DID HE SAY NO? ...THAT PASSED AWAY HERE YEARS AGO? APPARENTLY IT'S NOT THE LITTLE BOY THAT WAS BURNED THERE, SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER SPIRIT COULD BE IN THAT BARN. I KNEW I WASN'T TRIPPING, MAN. LIKE, I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING UP THERE. THAT'S CRAZY TO ME, MAN, LIKE, WHY ARE WE EVEN STILL IN HERE? I'M CREEPED OUT. I'M NOT GONNA EVEN LIE TO Y'ALL. LET ME SEE THAT LIGHT. LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO LOOK IF SOMETHING'S UP THERE. YOU GONNA GIVE HIM ONE OF THESE. THAT'S THE -- YEAH, AIN'T NOTHING UP THERE. - ARE YOU SURE? - YEAH, I SEE THERE. THIS SHOULDER RIGHT HERE, WHEN THIS SHOULDER LEANS BACK, YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO FIND NOTHING. RIGHT. THERE IS SOMETHING IN THERE, THOUGH. IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING IN THERE. MARCUS AND DALEN, MAN, THEY'RE GONE. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. HOWEVER, YOU REMEMBER MY MAIN MAN, JOE? WE'RE ABOUT TO GO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE CLAIMS HE HAD OVER HERE AT THE OVERSEER'S HOUSE. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, THIS WAS THE OVERSEER'S HOUSE. RIGHT. HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE SLAVES. SO, THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOT OF TENSION IN HERE. GOT TO BE. WE MAY NOT BE WELCOME HERE BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, AT THE TIME IN THE PERIOD HE WAS IN WAS SO MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE TIME WE'RE IN. RIGHT. WE WOULDN'T BE WORKING TOGETHER. ABSOLUTELY. HE MAY BE A LITTLE UPSET, SO, UH, WHENEVER YOU'RE READY, WE CAN ASK A FEW QUESTIONS. THE NEXT ROOM IS WHERE I SAW THE SOLDIER AT. AND THIS IS THE ACTUAL SPOT RIGHT HERE. - THIS IS THE WINDOW. - YES. THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE. I WAS STANDING RIGHT DOWN THERE, AND THE SPIRIT WAS JUST, LIKE, TRYING TO GET MY ATTENTION. SO, LET'S SEE IF I CAN DO AN EVP HERE. ALL RIGHT. IS THERE ANYONE HERE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO US? I WAS HERE A FEW YEARS AGO, AND SOMEONE TRIED TO GET MY ATTENTION. I'M HERE NOW, AND I'M LISTENING. ARE YOU OKAY WITH US WORKING TOGETHER? AS EQUALS? IT LOOKS LIKE WE GOT THAT. I THINK WE NEED TO PLAY THAT BACK. ABSOLUTELY. I SAW THAT -- SOMETHING JUMPED. WHEN YOU SAID, "AS EQUALS," SOMETHING HAPPENED. MAN. ARE YOU OKAY WITH US WORKING TOGETHER? AS EQUALS? [ STATIC ] AHH. AFTER I SAID, "AS EQUALS"... IT'S ALMOST AS THOUGH THE EMOTION JUST... - YEAH. - ...WENT UP IN THE ROOM. SOMETHING BECAME RESTLESS. HOWEVER, WE WERE STILL. IT APPEARS WE CAN ACTUALLY RILE THE OVERSEER. SO NOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL. I'M GONNA HANG OUT IN HIS SPOT IN THE HOUSE WHILE JOE GOES OUTSIDE AND ASKS HIM SOME QUESTIONS. HEY, JOE. - YEAH, MAN. I DON'T THINK THE OVERSEER'S GONNA BE TOO HAPPY WITH ME JUST CHILLING IN HIS HOME, MAN. YEAH. HE MIGHT REALLY GET UPSET, WOULDN'T HE? ALL RIGHT, MAN. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN MAKE HIM, UH, ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS FOR US. THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD. IS MY FRIEND, THE OVERSEER, HERE? MY FRIEND, WHO IS IN THE HOUSE, IS IN YOUR SPOT BY THE WAY. YOU WANT HIM TO LEAVE? THE ENERGY IS NOT WELCOMING AT ALL. IF YOU WANT HIM TO LEAVE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TELL HIM. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TALK TO HIM, TOUCH HIM, SOMETHING. I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE I HAVE ANY BUSINESS BEING IN HERE. THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY AND YOUR CHANCE TO TALK RIGHT NOW. IF I WALK AWAY FROM HERE WITHOUT ANY ANSWERS, THEN, UH, IT'S ON YOU. MAYBE WE SHOULD LISTEN TO THAT. THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY AND YOUR CHANCE TO TALK RIGHT NOW. IF I WALK AWAY FROM HERE WITHOUT ANY ANSWERS, THEN, UH, IT'S ON YOU. SOMEBODY SAYS, "WALK." WHAT? SOMEONE SAID, "WALK." I SAID, "IF I WALK AWAY FROM HERE WITHOUT ANY ANSWERS, IT'S ON YOU." AND SOMEONE SAID, "WALK." THIS IS INSANE. JOE JUST DID AN EVP RECORDING SESSION OUTSIDE. HE SAID HE GOT A RESPONSE THAT SAID, "WALK." DID YOU HEAR IT? IT'S BASICALLY LIKE, "MAN, TRY ME IF YOU WANT TO." MM. THAT IS DEFINITELY A REPLY. YOU HAVE GOT TO LISTEN TO THIS. I MEAN, THIS IS A CLASS-A EVP. IF I WALK AWAY FROM HERE WITHOUT ANY ANSWERS, THEN, UH, IT'S ON YOU. OH **** WALK. HE WAS LIKE, "WALK." HE TOLD ME TO WALK. THAT WAS -- I DON'T CARE. THAT'S HIS -- THAT'S HIS WAY, I DON'T CARE IF YOU WALK OR NOT. YEAH. SO, I GUESS WE PLAY ON HIS RULES, BY HIS TERMS. I CAME HERE TO GET ANSWERS TONIGHT. DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOT A DEFINITIVE ANSWER? YEAH. THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT ROOM. - APPRECIATE YOU, JOE. - THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME, MAN. ALL RIGHT, BRO. - POUND IT OUT. POUND IT OUT. POUND IT OUT. TELL YOU ONE THING. IT'S A BIG PLANTATION. MAN. HOLD UP A SECOND. YOU TIRED? YOU GOT YOUR ASTHMA PUMP? - SEE, THAT... - YOU GOT YOUR PUMP? MAN, I HATE DOING THIS ON A PLANTATION, LIKE -- LIKE HAVING AN ASTHMA ATTACK ALMOST. YOU DO REALIZE YOUR ANCESTORS WORKED A LITTLE BIT HARDER THAN THAT? OH, NO. I KNOW THIS. I FELT DISRESPECTFUL BY SPRAYING MY INHALER, LIKE, I SHOULD'VE TOUGHED IT OUT. Dalen: SO, MARCUS AND I ARE ACTUALLY HEADED OVER TO THE SLAVE QUARTERS. FIRST IT'D BE BETWEEN THESE HOMES, THESE SLAVE QUARTERS. I CAN'T EVEN REALLY CALL THEM HOMES, JUST... TO THEM, THIS WAS THEIR HOME. WE'RE GONNA GO OVER HERE. WE'RE GONNA DO AN EVP SESSION AND COME FROM AN ANGLE OF, LIKE, LOVE AND REVERENCE AND DEFERENCE. WHERE DO YOU FEEL LIKE, ON THIS PROPERTY, WAS, LIKE, THE CONGREGATING SPOT? IF I'M GETTING OFF, YOU KNOW, THAT -- THAT DAY -- DAY'S WORK, WE GOT TO SIT UNDER A TREE. EXACTLY. EXACTLY. AND THAT LOOKS LIKE THE BIGGEST TREE. RIGHT THERE. BRO, THAT'S WHY YOU MY GHOST BRO, BRO. - YEAH. - WE ALWAYS ON THE SAME PAGE. I TOLD YOU, MAN. I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD DO OUR EVP OVER HERE. SHOOT THE BREEZE WITH OUR ANCESTORS. YEAH. FIRST QUESTION -- WAS THIS YOU GUYS' HANG-OUT SPOT? DID TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU IN THIS AREA? OR HAPPY TIMES IN THIS AREA? WHAT KEEPS YOU HERE? YOU HEAR THAT? IT SERIOUSLY SOUND LIKE SOMETHING KNOCKED. IT'S OVER HERE. LOOK! LOOK! IT'S OVER HERE! OVER HERE. - OKAY. - THERE'S SOMETHING... IT'S OVER HERE. HEY, CHECK THAT DOOR DOWN THERE. IT SOUNDED LIKE THE INSIDE OF THE HOUSE. THAT ONE GOT A LOCK ON IT, BRUH. IT DEFINITELY SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS COMING FROM THE INSIDE. IT DEFINITELY CAME -- BUT EVERY DOOR IS LOCKED, BRO. THAT -- THAT ONE HAD A LOCK ON IT, RIGHT? - YEAH. - THIS ONE'S LOCKED. EVERY DOOR IS LOCKED. EVERY WINDOW IS BOLTED SHUT. I HAVE NO EXPLANATION. Marcus: TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE. MON NOM EST DALEN. **** THINK I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID MY REAL NAME? YOU GOT TO GIVE THEM THE WRONG NAME EVERY TIME, DAWG. YOU GOT TO GIVE THEM A FALSE NAME FIRST. MON NOM EST MARCUS. NOT MY NAME. BOY, I TELL YOU... WHY WOULD YOU GIVE THEM MY NAME? I'M NOT GONNA GIVE MY NAME! SO, IT'S LIKE NOW WE BOTH CAUGHT, HUH? WELL, IF I'M IN IT, YOU IN IT. WHY DON'T WE LISTEN TO THE EVP? WHAT KEEPS YOU HERE? - YOU HEAR THAT? - YEP. I HEARD THAT. WHAT IS KEEPING YOU HERE, AND SOMETHING KNOCKED FROM THE INSIDE OF THIS HOUSE. YEAH. MISS AGNES, RIGHT? SHE WAS THIS SPIRITUAL FORCE, USED VOODOO AND CONJURING UP OF THESE SPELLS AND THESE POTIONS AND ALL THIS STUFF... - UH-HUH. WHAT IF SHE'S KEEPING THE SPIRITS HERE? OH. I SHOULD HIT YOU IN THE HEAD WITH THE REM-POD. IT WOULD GO OFF, TOO, BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING, BRUH. THINK ABOUT IT. WHAT IF MISS AGNES... IF AUNT AGNES IS STILL IN THAT BUILDING... RIGHT. SHE'S THE PIECE THAT HOLDS ALL THESE SPIRITS TOGETHER. MAN. DO YOU HEAR THAT? DUDE, THAT CAME FROM THIS SIDE. BRO, SOMETHING IS KNOCKING FROM CABIN TO CABIN, BRO. HELLO? THIS ONE HAS A LOCK ON IT, TOO. IT'S CLEARLY SOUNDING LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE THESE CABINS. - YEAH. YEAH. SO, LIKE, I THINK WE REALLY... BRO. COME ON, MAN. - AGAIN, DAWG. - DID YOU NOT HEAR THAT? DID YOU HEAR THAT, BRO? DUDE. BRUH. LIKE, YOU CAN FEEL THE ENERGY, TOO. YOU KNOW WHAT'S LOW-KEY KIND OF CRAZY? I JUST REALIZED THAT I LOW-KEY KIND OF STEPPED BEHIND YOU... I SEEN THAT, AND I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, HE'S KIND OF CLOSE." NO, BRUH. BUT, BRUH, I WAS TOO CLOSE TO THAT WALL. [ MOANING ] WHAT WAS THAT? HELLO? HELLO? [ COW MOOS ] AND THAT'S A COW. THEY FOUND US. THEY FOUND US. HERE I AM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLANTATION. DECIDED I'D COME CHECK OUT THE BIG HOUSE. LIKE, THE WHOLE AMBIENCE IS JUST SAD. IT'S A LOT OF ENERGY COMING FROM THIS HOUSE, MAN. ACCORDING TO LEGEND, AFTER BEING KILLED BY UNION SOLDIERS, THE OVERSEER WAS BURIED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE MAIN HOUSE. SO, EVEN THOUGH I REALLY DREAD DOING THIS, WE'VE GOT TO CHECK AND SEE IF ANYTHING'S THERE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO APPROACH THE PLANTATION HOME. I'M SURE I'M NOT WELCOME. HERE WE ARE. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GO FORWARD. I -- I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY NEEDS TO JUST, LIKE, GIVE ME A, LIKE, GOOD KICK. OH, MAN. **** HERE WE ARE. THE FRONT OF MAGNOLIA PLANTATION'S BIG HOUSE. OH, MAN. I GOT TO GO THROUGH THE JUNGLE JUST TO GET TO THE FRONT DOOR. **** **** OH, MAN. THAT WAS FACE FIRST INTO A WEB. **** OH. I WALKED FACE FIRST INTO THAT. ONE OF TWO THINGS -- THIS IS EITHER HOW A BAD HORROR MOVIE STARTS, OR I'M ABOUT TO BECOME A SUPER HERO. I -- I DON'T KNOW. LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT HERE. YEAH. I'M SORRY, BROTHER. I THINK THE COAST IS CLEAR. WHAT THE **** THE OVERSEER IS SUPPOSED TO BE BURIED SOMEWHERE AROUND THIS HOUSE. I'M NOT GONNA LIE. THIS IS DEFINITELY CREEPING ME OUT. I BET YOU THE OWNERS OF THIS PLANTATION WALKED AROUND THE HOUSE ALL DAY MAD. THAT'S WHAT THE ENERGY FEELS LIKE OVER HERE. I'M UP HERE ON THE PORCH. [ ANIMAL SCREECHES ] WHAT WAS THAT? THAT SOUNDED LIKE A BAT OR... I'MA TAKE A LOOK DOWN HERE IN THIS WINDOW. I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M GETTING OFF THIS PORCH, MAN. I THINK I SHOULD MAKE MY WAY DOWN AROUND THE HOUSE TO THE BACKSIDE. I'M GONNA BRING OUT MY THERMAL CAMERA AND SEE IF I CAN SEE ANY TYPE OF VARIANCES IN TEMPERATURE. HERE WE GO. SMARTPHONES ARE A LOT EASIER TO CARRY AROUND THAN OLD-SCHOOL THERMAL CAMS. OH, MAN. LOOK AT THIS. WE GOT ONE TEMPERATURE RIGHT THERE. THOSE FIRST FOUR WINDOWS ON THE FIRST FLOOR. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR. I'M GONNA RAISE IT UP TO THE SECOND LEVEL. YOU'RE GONNA SEE THE HEAT CHANGE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, BUT... SEE THAT LITTLE COLD SPOT? WHAT IS THAT IN THE BOTTOM OF THAT WINDOW MOVING? THAT IS CRAZY. LOOK AT THE THIRD WINDOW. THERE IS AN OBSTRUCTION IN THE BOTTOM PANEL. I NEED A LIGHT. IN THAT WINDOW? OH, THAT LOOKS LIKE AN AIR-CONDITIONING UNIT. WE'VE GOT TO TAKE EVERY PIECE OF EVIDENCE SERIOUSLY. BUT THAT COLD SPOT IN THE WINDOW WAS JUST AN AIR CONDITIONER. NO OVERSEER HERE. WE'RE HEADED TO THE AGNES CABIN. MAN, AUNT AGNES. Marcus: SHE WAS A KNOWN VOODOO CONJURER WHO MADE ITEMS TO HEAL AND PROTECT THE PEOPLE IN THE SLAVE QUARTERS ON THIS PLANTATION. MANY FOLKS STILL BELIEVE THAT SHE'S HERE PROTECTING THE QUARTERS. I JUST HOPE WE STAY ON HER GOOD SIDE AND DON'T PISS HER OFF TONIGHT. HERE WE ARE. WE'RE AT AUNTIE AGNES' SPOT. Dalen: SO, MARCUS AND I ARE ABOUT TO HEAD INTO AUNT AGNES' CABIN. THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE CLAIMS OF SHADOW FIGURES AND WHISPERS. AND THIS IS ALSO THE AREA WHICH DR. BROWN WAS EXCAVATING AND FOUND LITTLE VOODOO ARTIFACTS. SO, I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN FIND IN HERE. LET'S GO, MARCUS. MON NOM EST DALEN. IF WE'RE GONNA GO INTO THE SLAVE QUARTERS AND TRY TO REACH OUT TO SOMEONE LIKE AUNT AGNES, WE SHOULD SPEAK TO THEM IN THEIR DIALECT AS A SIGN OF RESPECT. MON NOM EST MARCUS. BONSOIR. SHH. [ CLATTERING ] OUCH. THAT'S ME. THAT'S ME. I SAW THAT. I KNOW THAT WAS YOU. JUST CAN'T SEE THE BENCH IN FRONT OF ME. FIRST OFF, THANK YOU FOR HAVING US IN YOUR HOME. WE APPRECIATE THE HOSPITALITY. THIS IS ACTUALLY AUNTIE AGNES' ROOM. DR. BROWN ACTUALLY SAID THIS IS WHERE SHE BURIED STUFF. I'MA SET THE REM-POD UP IN THIS ONE. [ REM-POD BEEPING ] ALL RIGHT. SO, WE KNOW THAT IT WORKS. I KIND OF WANT TO JUST ASK THE REM-POD DIRECT QUESTIONS, SO MAYBE AUNTIE AGNES CAN SPEAK THROUGH THE REM-POD. KIND OF WANT TO MAKE OUR WAY BACK HERE. YEAH, WE CAN. AUNTIE AGNES, THANK YOU FOR HAVING US AGAIN. WHAT WE HAVE IS CALLED A REM-POD. IT PICKS UP ENERGY. SO, WE'RE ASKING YOU TO COMMUNICATE WITH US THROUGH THE REM-POD. ARE YOU HERE WITH US? WE JUST GENUINELY WANT TO KNOW, ARE THERE SPIRITS HERE? DO YOU JUST WANT US TO LEAVE? ALL RIGHT, AUNTIE AGNES. YOU AIN'T GOT TO TALK TO US. WE GET IT. YOU KNOW WHAT IT COULD BE, THOUGH? WHAT? I'M NOT GONNA LIE, AUNTIES DO GO TO BED EARLY. WHAT TIME IS IT? HER HAIR WRAPPED AND EVERYTHING. HER HAIR WRAPPED. SHE DONE TOOK HER BRA OFF. SHE GOT HER MUUMUU ON. SHE GOT A CIGARETTE. MANNY, DIDN'T I TELL YOUR ASS TO GET IN THAT BED? WE WOULD JUST LOVE SOME TYPE OF JUST... - INTERACTION. - ...INTERACTION WITH YOU. AND WE COME IN ALL RESPECT. SO, ARE YOU IN HERE WITH US NOW? [ REM-POD BEEPING ] - OH, MY GOD. - OH **** Dalen: THIS IS WHERE AUNT AGNES BURIED HER VOODOO ARTIFACTS. MANY BELIEVE THAT THIS CONJURER IS STILL HERE PROTECTING THE SLAVE QUARTERS. HOPEFULLY WHATEVER RESPONSES WE GET, THE REM-POD WILL CATCH IT AND LIGHT UP. SO, ARE YOU IN HERE WITH US NOW? [ REM-POD BEEPING ] Marcus: OH, MY GOD. WOW. - I'M STUCK, BRO. - YO, IT'S MAKING MY -- IT'S, LIKE, MAKING THE HAIRS ON MY ARMS STAND UP, BROTHER. I WONDER IF THIS COULD'VE BEEN THE SPIRIT THAT WAS WATCHING US EARLIER 'CAUSE, I MEAN, IF YOU THINK -- [ REM-POD BEEPING ] HELL, THAT'S CRAZY, MAN. UH... OH. - YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN? - UNH-UNH. Dalen: IT WAS LITERALLY A SHARP PAIN IN MY HEAD, BRUH. DEFINITELY SOMETHING IN THAT CABIN, FROM THE SHARP PAINS THAT I HAD IN MY HEAD TO THE REM-POD GOING OFF. SOMETHING WAS LETTING ITS PRESENCE BE KNOWN. IT WASN'T SOMETHING PUSHING ME AWAY, THOUGH. IT WAS MORE SO LIKE, "I'M HERE." Marcus: THAT'S FOG. NO, I -- I SEE THE FOG, BUT I HEARD FOOTSTEPS. THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE, DAWG. I WALKED OUT. YOU WALKED OUT. WHO ELSE WAS IN THERE? - DO YOU HEAR THAT? - I DEFINITELY HEAR THAT, DAWG. THERE'S SOMETHING WALKING... - LIKE, BACK AND FORTH... - ...BACK AND FORTH... - ...THROUGH THE ROOM. - ...THROUGH THE ROOM. DAWG. [ FOOTSTEPS ] IT'S A LOT OF FOOTSTEPS. - IT'S LIKE... - WALKING...

YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOT TO DO? ONE OF US GOT TO GO IN THERE BY THEMSELVES. AUNT AGNES, SHE POKED DALEN IN THE HEAD. SEEMS LIKE SHE GOT A LOT MORE TO SAY TO HIM, SO ME AND JUWAN, WE GONNA STEP OUT, GIVE HIM SOME PRIVATE TIME WHILE WE CHECK OUT THE REST OF THE PLANTATION'S CLAIMS. YOU'RE GOING IN THE TANTE AGNES ROOM ALONE. THIS PLANTATION'S HUGE. Y'ALL ARE NOWHERE NEAR WHERE I'M GONNA BE, SO... YOU GOT A WALKIE-TALKIE, MAN. WHAT THAT'S GONNA DO IF I WALKIE-TALKIE YOU? - LISTEN... - YOU GON' RUN TO ME? SHOOT, I'M GLAD I'M NOT GOING IN THERE. I'M JUST GONNA BE HONEST. - WHAT KIND OF ADVICE IS THAT? IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

Marcus: WE'RE GOING TO THE BLACKSMITH SHOP, WHERE PEOPLE HAVE CLAIMED TO SEE SHADOWS, HEAR METAL BANGING AND WHISPERS. I'M GONNA TELL YOU THIS. WE STILL NOT THERE. THIS IS THE LONGEST WALK. YOU KNOW THE FIRST QUESTION I'M GONNA ASK WHEN WE GET IN HERE? BLACKSMITH, CAN I GET A CUP OF WATER? DUDE, HERE IT IS, BRO. THAT JOINT LOOKS CREEPY, THOUGH. I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU. MAN, IT'S OPEN. [ DOOR CREAKS ] OH, HELL NO. - OH, SNAP. - NO, SIR. YOU GONNA TAKE THE FIRST STEP? OH, HELL NO. LET'S GO, BRUH. DUDE. IT FEELS LIKE THE HEAVIEST PRESENCE IN HERE, DAWG. HEAVY IS A GREAT WAY TO DESCRIBE IT. THEY LITERALLY LEFT ME IN HERE. WHAT YOU MEAN, WHY I DON'T WANT TO BE IN HERE BY MYSELF? UH, DUH, BECAUSE IF SOMETHING HAPPEN, I'M IN HERE BY MY DAMN SELF.

YOU KEEP HEARING FOOTSTEPS. [ CREAKING ] AUNT AGNES, YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THE PERSON THAT WAS WATCHING OUT FOR PEOPLE, MAN. I'M NOT HERE TO HURT YOU NOR HARM YOU. I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING TRYING TO DRAW ME OUT, BUT I'M GONNA STAY PUT. GOD FORBID ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME. I MIGHT AS WELL JUST GO AHEAD AND DIVVY UP MY STUFF NOW. MY FLAT SCREEN TV, I GUESS, JUWAN, YOU CAN HAVE THAT. MY CLOTHES, YOU CAN GIVE THEM TO... WELL, I WAS GONNA SAY MARCUS, BUT... Marcus: IT FEELS LIKE THE HEAVIEST PRESENCE IN HERE, DAWG. Marcus: SO, RIGHT NOW, WE'RE ACTUALLY IN THE BLACKSMITH'S BARN. WE HAVE CLAIMS OF DARK APPARITIONS. WE HAVE CLAIMS OF, UH, METAL BANGING. SO, ME AND JUWAN ARE IN HERE. WE'RE GONNA SEE IF WE CAN CONJURE UP SOME THINGS, IF YOU WILL. Marcus: WHAT DO WE GOT OVER HERE, MAN? WOW. - OH, MY GOSH. OH. YO, HE MADE THIS, MAN. THIS HAS SOME HISTORY ON IT, BROTHER. - GOT SOME DIRT ON IT. - I WONDER WHAT -- WHAT THIS WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY, YOU KNOW, IF THESE -- IF THESE NAILS COULD TALK. THESE CHAINS COULD TALK. LOOK AT THAT. - DANG. ALL THESE, I JUST LOOK AND I SEE NEGATIVE STUFF. LIKE, I WONDER HOW HE FELT TO ACTUALLY HAVE TO MAKE ALL OF THIS. YEAH, 'CAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE HE WOULD BE, LIKE, ALMOST FORCED TO MAKE OPPRESSION, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? AND IT'S NOT HIS CHOICE, BUT HE JUST HAD TO DO WHAT HE HAD TO DO. [ RATTLING ] WHAT IS THAT NOISE? DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? - YEAH. IT SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING WAS RATTLING OVER HERE, MAN. YO. THAT'S WHAT THAT SOUND WAS. THIS BELLOWS WAS, LIKE... A BELLOWS... WAS MAKING THIS, LIKE, SOUND. OH, THERE IT IS. HOW DID IT JUST START MOVING, THOUGH? LIKE, THERE WAS NOBODY OVER HERE, MAN, LIKE.. OBVIOUSLY, THIS WAS, LIKE, A SIGN. YEAH.

IT JUST FEELS LIKE SOMETHING'S GETTING CLOSER. WHAT THE... [ METAL CLINKS ] HOW DID MY -- HOW DID MY RING JUST... I HEARD IT FALL, BUT MY HAND WASN'T EVEN IN A POSITION FOR IT TO FALL, AND THAT'S, LIKE, MY... IT MAKES ME NERVOUS BECAUSE THAT'S, LIKE, MY SAFETY RING. IT HAS A CROSS ON IT WITH THE LORD'S PRAYER IN SPANISH, AND I WEAR IT TO EVERY LOCATION THAT WE GO TO. PLEASE, LET ME FIND MY RING. [ FOOTSTEPS ] COME ON, MAN. OKAY. OKAY. IF YOU'RE WALKING, PLEASE, I HEAR YOU. THE SAME WAY YOU WAS UPSET WHEN PEOPLE DUG YOUR STUFF UP AND TOOK YOUR STUFF, AUNTIE AGNES, MAN, THAT'S HOW I KIND OF FEEL, MAN, LIKE... I UNDERSTAND THE SPIRITS CAN BE PLAYFUL, AND MAYBE THEY CAN HIDE THINGS. I JUST REALLY WANT MY STUFF. BUT WHAT REALLY HIT ME AT THE LAST MINUTE BEFORE I WALKED OUT WAS AGNES LOST THINGS THAT SHE BURIED IN THIS HOUSE. IS THAT HOW YOU FELT WHEN DR. BROWN DUG YOUR STUFF UP AND MISPLACED THE THINGS THAT YOU HAD? IN THAT SENSE, I UNDERSTAND IT, SO I JUST KIND OF LEFT IT FOR AGNES, KIND OF LIKE AN APOLOGY. NOW IT'S TIME TO MEET BACK UP WITH THE GUYS AND GO OVER EVERYTHING THAT WE EXPERIENCED TONIGHT. WE GOT A LOT OF ACTIVITY OUT HERE ON THIS PROPERTY, MAN. - WOO-WEE. - BRO, A LOT, MAN. I LOST MY RING, MAN. - IT'S GONE. - IT'S GONE. - IT'S JUST GONE. - BUT -- BUT LOOK, THOUGH. ON SOME REAL STUFF, YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE MAYBE AGNES HAS MY RING, MAN? - YEAH. - IT'S PROTECTION, BRUH. - THEN I'M OKAY WITH IT. I'M OKAY WITH LEAVING MY RING HERE, MAN. COOL. HEY, LISTEN. ALL I'M GONNA SAY IS WE HAVE A LOT OF STUFF THAT HAPPENED TO US, LIKE, WE SAW A SHADOW FIGURE. THAT WAS THE GIN BARN, RIGHT? - YEAH. Juwan: SO, WE WENT OVER TO THE OVERSEER'S HOUSE. THAT'S WHERE JOE SAID HE HAD A CLAIM OF THE SOLDIER IN THE WINDOW. IS MY FRIEND THE OVERSEER HERE? AND THIS BLEW MY MIND, GUYS. IF I WALK AWAY FROM HERE WITHOUT ANY ANSWERS, IT'S ON YOU. SOMEBODY SAYS, "WALK." Juwan: IT TOLD HIM, DEFINITIVELY, "WALK." MAN. THAT LET ME KNOW, MAN, THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING IN THIS HOUSE. Marcus: I WAS WALKING AROUND THE SLAVE QUARTERS... - IT'S OVER HERE. - LOOK. LOOK. WE HEARD A KNOCK ON THE INSIDE. Dalen: SOMETHING IS KNOCKING FROM CABIN TO CABIN, BRO. SOMEBODY WAS PLAYING DING DONG DITCH WITH US OUT IN THAT FIELD. WE GOT VOICES ON THE EVP. WE GOT FOOTSTEPS RUNNING BACK AND FORTH IN AUNT AGNES' HOUSE. IT'S A LOT OF ENERGY ON THIS PROPERTY. LIKE, YOU GOT THE OPPRESSOR SENDING OUT ALL TYPES OF ENERGY TOWARDS THESE SLAVES. - MM-HMM. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE SLAVES SENDING BACK, LIKE, A PROTECTIVE ENERGY BACK TOWARDS THEM. LIKE A BIG WAR. Dalen: WE CAME HERE TO THE MAGNOLIA PLANTATION TO SEE IF ITS HISTORY OF VOODOO AND THE PEOPLE THAT ONCE LIVED HERE ARE THE SOURCE OF THE PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. AND BASED ON WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED TONIGHT, WE CAN SAY THAT THE HISTORY IS STILL VERY MUCH ALIVE. I FEEL LIKE IT'S BEEN STAMPED AND APPROVED AND CERTIFIED... - AND CERTIFIED... - AND CERTIFIED. WE CAN GET ON UP OUT OF HERE, MAN. SIGNED, SEALED, DELIVERED. HEY, MAN. YOU GOT THE KEYS? I GOT -- I GOT 'EM. I GOT 'EM. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. - OH, ALL RIGHT. - COOL. - LET'S GET ON OUT OF HERE.
