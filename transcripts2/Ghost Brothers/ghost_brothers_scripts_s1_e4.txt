 WHEN A BROTHER'S BY HIMSELF. YOU ALL RIGHT? JUST WIRES AND COBWEBS, HOMIE. OUR MISSION IS TO HIT THE MOST HAUNTED LOCATIONS IN AMERICA TO PROVE THAT GHOSTS ARE FOR REAL. JUWAN! YOU ARE NOT WELCOMED ON THIS PROPERTY. - WE ARE... - THE GHOST BROTHERS. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS WHAT'S UP, WHAT'S UP? YOU LOOK EXCITED. I ACTUALLY AM VERY EXCITED. GOT ANOTHER CASE FOR YOU GUYS. OKAY, WHAT'S UP? THE DELTA QUEEN. THE DELTA QUEEN, BRO, IS ACTUALLY A PADDLEWHEEL STEAMBOAT. WORD. IT WAS PARKED IN CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE. - OKAY. - SOMEONE BOUGHT IT AND ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT TO HOUMA, LOUISIANA, TO RENOVATE IT. THEY SAY THAT'S WHEN ALL THE ACTIVITY STARTED HAPPENING ON THIS BOAT, BRO. WORD. THE DELTA QUEEN WAS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAVAGANT RIVERBOATS OF ITS TIME, COSTING OVER $1 MILLION TO MAKE WAY BACK IN 1927. ITS LONG AND DISTINGUISHED LIST OF PASSENGERS INCLUDE A U.S. PRESIDENT. BUT IT HASN'T BEEN ALL GLITZ AND GLAMOUR ONBOARD. IN THE 1950s A DUDE GOT GUTTED IN THE KITCHEN 'CAUSE HE GOT INTO A DISPUTE WITH THE BUTCHER OVER GAMBLING. I THOUGHT IT WAS, LIKE, OVER HIS CORNBREAD. YOU WOULD GUT SOMEBODY OVER CORNBREAD? DEPENDING ON HOW GOOD THE CORNBREAD IS. REPORTS OF PARANORMAL ACTIVITY HAVE INCREASED IN THE PAST YEAR. WE'VE GOT CLAIMS OF DOORS OPENING AND CLOSING, APPARITIONS, AND DISEMBODIED WHISPERS COMING FROM THE WALLS. SO, CAPTAIN MIKE, HE'S ACTUALLY THE CURRENT CAPTAIN OF THE BOAT. HE SAYS HE FEELS LIKE IT'S HAUNTED BY A PREVIOUS CAPTAIN, A WOMAN. CAPTAIN "MA" GREENE. HE SAYS ONCE THEY MOVED THE BOAT, SHE SHOWED UP. MAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAN. WE'LL SEE YOU REAL SOON. ALL RIGHT, FOR SURE. ALL RIGHT. NOW, I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF ELEMENTS, MAN, TO MAKE THIS A REALLY DOPE CASE, BRO. LET'S GO TO LOUISIANA. LET'S HEAD TO LOUISIANA, FELLAS. IT'S TIME TO GET GHOSTED. SO, WE'RE HEADED TO HOUMA, LOUISIANA. - WORD. - YEAH. - HOME OF THE DELTA QUEEN. - YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING? LIKE, WE'VE NEVER INVESTIGATED A BOAT BEFORE. WE'VE ALSO NEVER INVESTIGATED A LIGHTHOUSE. A SUBMARINE, A WING OF CHICKEN, A POPEYE'S. - POPEYE'S. - WALMART. A TREEHOUSE. TREEHOUSE. FRAT HOUSE. SPEAKING OF FRAT HOUSE, OUR FRAT BROTHER JASON HIT ME UP THE OTHER DAY, MAN. HE ASKED WHAT WE WERE DOING, MAN. I TOLD HIM WE WAS OUT HERE INVESTIGATING. HE SAID HE WANTED TO COME OUT. DOES HE KNOW WHAT WE DO? HE BETTER BRING THEM GATOR BOOTS. IT'D BE GOOD TO HAVE AN EXTRA BRO WITH US TONIGHT BECAUSE THE SWAMP IS UNFAMILIAR TERRITORY TO US. BUT BEFORE WE INVESTIGATE, WE'RE GONNA TALK TO SOMEONE WHO SPENT HIS LIFE OUT HERE AND SEE WHAT HE KNOWS ABOUT THE DELTA QUEEN. BEING OUT HERE ON THE WATER, YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING? LIKE, ANY GHOSTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT OUT HERE? WELL, YOU COME OUT AT NIGHTTIME, YOU HEAR SOME WEIRD SOUNDS, DUDE. STRANGE THINGS, I'M TELLING YOU. YEAH. HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE DELTA QUEEN? - I'VE BEEN ON THE DELTA QUEEN. - WORD? YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE BEFORE WE GO ON THAT DELTA QUEEN? YEAH? RUN. ALL RIGHT, DELTA QUEEN. THIS MASSIVE LADY HERE. I CAN IMAGINE HER BACK IN THE DAY WAS PROBABLY BEAUTIFUL. SHE WAS BAD. SHE WAS LIKE PAM GRIER. YOU DON'T GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE A NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK LIKE THE DELTA QUEEN EVERY DAY. - GENTLEMEN. - HOW'S IT GOING? I'M CAPTAIN MIKE OF THE DELTA QUEEN. AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO GET OUR DELTA QUEEN SEA LEGS THAN TO SPEAK TO THE MAN WHO'S CAPTAINED IT FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS? SO, HOW DID WE GET THIS BEAUTIFUL QUEEN HERE IN HOUMA, LOUISIANA? WELL, THE BOAT HAD BEEN TIED UP AS A FLOATING HOTEL UP IN CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE. BASICALLY, WE WENT UP AND GOT GRANDMOTHER OUT OF THE NURSING HOME AND BROUGHT HER DOWN HERE TO WHERE HER FAMILY IS, HER RIVER FAMILY, TO PUT THE DELTA QUEEN BACK INTO FULL SERVICE. IT'S OUR MISSION TO FIND OUT IF THE DELTA QUEEN'S MOVE TO LOUISIANA FOR RENOVATIONS STIRRED UP ACTIVITY, AND TO SEE IF ANY SPIRITS THAT REMAIN HERE MIGHT DISAPPROVE OF THAT RENOVATION. I'VE HEARD PEOPLE TELL ME THAT THEY'VE SEEN FOLKS WALKING AROUND AS IF IT'S THE 1930s. FOLKS REPORT SEEING A DOOR SWING OPEN AND CLOSE. NOW, I'VE SEEN THAT MYSELF. YOU BECOME AWARE OF THINGS THAT ARE MOVING AROUND YOU. SOMETIMES QUITE OFTEN IN YOUR PERIPHERAL VISION, YOU SEE SOMETHING. WAIT. YOU DON'T HEAR ALL THIS LIGHTNING? WE'RE GONNA DO A GHOST HUNT RIGHT NOW? LIKE, OKAY. I'M JUST SAYING, LIKE, IT'S, LIKE, THAT MAKES IT SCARY, THOUGH. - LIKE -- - I FEEL LIKE, MAN, THAT UPS OUR CHANCES OF SEEING SOMETHING. CAPTAIN MIKE TELLS US THAT HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED ON THE BOAT OVER THE YEARS. MOST OF THEM HAVE DIED ON HERE PEACEFULLY, SOME VIOLENTLY. THERE HAS BEEN A MURDER ONBOARD. BACK IN THE LATE '50s, TWO CHEFS WERE IN THE KITCHEN. THEY HAD A DISAGREEMENT. IT ESCALATED. ONE GUY STABBED AND DISEMBOWELED THE OTHER MAN. MANY BELIEVE THAT THE MURDERED CHEF STILL ROAMS THE KITCHEN. CLAIMS INCLUDE FOOTSTEPS, SHADOW FIGURES, AND APPARITIONS. IT'S BELIEVED THAT THE MURDERED CHEF ISN'T THE ONLY CREW MEMBER REPORTED TO HAUNT THE BOAT. THE BIGGEST PRESENCE ONBOARD IS ITS CAPTAIN FROM THE 1940s, CAPTAIN MA GREENE. SHE'S LIKE THE GRANDMOTHER WHO WATCHES OVER THIS BOAT. SHE DIED IN 1949 ONBOARD. IT WAS MA GREENE WHO CAPTAIN MIKE BELIEVED SUMMONED HIM TO THE BOWELS OF THE SHIP THE NIGHT IT SPRUNG A NEAR FATAL LEAK. THIS IS THE SPOT THAT WE PATCHED THAT NIGHT WHEN I WAS AWAKENED AND THE WATER WAS FLOODING IN HERE. AND IF I HADN'T HAVE BEEN WOKEN UP, THIS BOAT WOULD'VE SANK. SO, IF WE INVESTIGATE DOWN HERE TONIGHT, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN EXPECT? YOU'LL HEAR NOISES. EVEN NOW WHEN THE BOILERS ARE SILENT AND COLD, YOU'LL HEAR A CLANKING OF METAL OR THE DECK PLATES MOVING AS IF SOMEONE'S WALKING DOWN BELOW. DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR US? LISTEN AND SEE WHAT THE BOAT -- HOW SHE TALKS TO YOU. SHE'S PROBABLY GONNA OPEN UP TO YOU AND REVEAL SOMETHING TO YOU. AND THE BOAT DID OPEN UP TO PARANORMAL ENTHUSIASTS PAUL AND JULIE. THEY PROVOKED THE SPIRIT OF THE FORMER CAPTAIN. MA GREENE, THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP, SHE WAS A TEETOTALER AND DIDN'T ALLOW ANY ALCOHOL ON THE BOAT AT ALL. WE SET UP IN ROOM 109, WHICH IS RIGHT BACK HERE, BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CAPTAIN GREENE'S OLD SUITE. AND SO AS A TRIGGER OBJECT, WE DECIDED TO BRING SOME ALCOHOL IN, JUST TRYING TO GET A REACTION. AND SO WE OPENED THE BEER AND I'M, LIKE, "I'M GONNA TAKE A DRINK," AND SOMETHING THAT WE COULDN'T SEE JUST WENT -- AND POPPED ME RIGHT THERE ON THE ARM. IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE DON'T PLAY NO GAMES. YOU DON'T DRINK ON HER BOAT, YOU DON'T TALK BACK. THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR AUNTIE'S HOUSE. IT IS MY AUNTIE'S HOUSE. HOW ABOUT THIS? WOULD YOU GUYS BE WILLING TO INVESTIGATE WITH US TONIGHT? GOSH, WE'D LOVE TO. YES, THANK YOU. WITH TWO MORE ADDITIONS TO THIS TEAM, WE'LL HAVE SOME SOLID HELP IN FIGURING OUT WHO'S ON THIS BOAT AND IF THE LINGERING SPIRITS ARE THREATENING OR NOT. WITH THE FORMER CAPTAIN DYING HERE AND A MURDER TAKING PLACE, WHO KNOWS WHAT WE MIGHT ENCOUNTER TONIGHT? AND DON'T FORGET, WE HAVE OUR FRAT BROTHER JASON JOINING US, TOO. I MEAN, WE'VE BEEN KNOWING THIS GUY FOR 10-PLUS YEARS. SO, Y'ALL, WHAT'S SERIOUS? WHAT'S GOING ON, BOSS? I DECIDED TO BRING HIM ON OUT 'CAUSE HE'S ALWAYS QUESTIONING US ABOUT WHAT WE DO. SO WHAT BETTER WAY TO INTRODUCE HIM TO IT THAN THROW HIM IN THE DEEP END? I SURE HOPE HE CAN SWIM. THIS IS A HAUNTED BOAT, SUPPOSEDLY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING MYSELF INTO, BUT I'M KEEPING MY EYE OUT. WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND INITIATE JASON. LET'S GO. MAN, THAT JOINT LOOKS CREEPY, DAWG. SHE LOOKS SCARIER AT NIGHT. SOMEBODY JUST STAY CLOSE. WE GOT YOU, BROTHER. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE ABOUT TO DO? WHAT'S THAT? POPPING THE TRUNK ON THE GHOSTS. YES, FELLAS. YES, YES, YES. OKAY. GOT US SOME VIDEO CAMERAS. ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA NEED THAT. YOU'RE GONNA NEED THAT 'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA BE BY YOURSELF IN ONE OF THOSE ROOMS. WE HAVE FOUR LIGHTS. - I'M GONNA TAKE THAT. - NO, YOU'RE NOT. I'M GONNA HAVE TWO LIGHTS, BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I ROLL, BABY. JASON, YOU READY? TO THE SHIP! - TO THE SHIP. - TO THE SHIP. I GOT TWO LIGHTS TODAY. TO THE QUEEN. HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN THAT I COULD HAVE TWO LIGHTS? OKAY, NOW, IF I FALL DOWN SOME STAIRS, WHO GONNA GET ME? SOMEBODY HAVE YOU. I GOT TWO LIGHTS. I CAN FIND YOU. TO INVESTIGATE THE CLAIMS ON THIS GIGANTIC VESSEL, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SPLIT UP. SO, WHILE MARCUS HEADS UP TO CAPTAIN MA'S QUARTERS, JUWAN IS GONNA TACKLE THE ENGINE ROOM. AND ME AND INVESTIGATION NEWBIE JASON, WE'RE GONNA HIT THE KITCHEN. THE KITCHEN IS -- THAT'S WHERE THE ONLY MURDER ON THE BOAT HAPPENED. LIKE, COME ON, MAN, ANY TIME SOMEBODY'S MURDERED, LIKE, THERE'S ALWAYS TYPE OF, LIKE, BAD ENERGY AND NEGATIVE ENERGY. SO, MAN, YOU JUST GONNA START ME OUT RIGHT TO THE MURDER? BRO, I FEEL LIKE, MAN, IF YOU'RE GONNA JUMP IN, YOU GOT TO JUMP IN FEET FIRST, BABY. - LET ME GET THE CAMERA READY. - ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT. COOL. ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN FEEL THE ENERGY DOWN HERE, BRO. PEOPLE HEAR FOOTSTEPS AND SEE CRAZY APPARITIONS. SHH. SHH. YOU ANXIOUS, AIN'T YOU? - DID YOU HEAR THAT? - I DID. IT'S FOOTSTEPS. BRO. I KNOW YOU HEAR THE FOOTSTEPS. I DO, BRO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM. IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S RUNNING. I HEAR IT, AND IT'S GETTING STRONGER. BRO. - BRO. - I KNOW YOU HEAR THE FOOTSTEPS. I DO, BRO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S COMING FROM. IT SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S RUNNING. I HEAR IT, AND IT'S GETTING STRONGER. BRO. IT'S THIS WAY, JASON. WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE KITCHEN OF THE DELTA QUEEN, WHERE IN A HEATED ARGUMENT BACK IN THE 1950s, THE CHEF'S BUTCHER STABBED THE CHEF TO DEATH WITH HIS BUTCHER'S KNIFE. WE'RE HEARING FOOTSTEPS RIGHT NOW IN THE AREA WHERE THE MURDER OCCURRED. I HAVE AN IDEA. SEE IF YOU SEE, LIKE, A KNIFE. SOME TYPE OF... HERE WE GO. - JASON. - YEAH. HOLD THIS KNIFE, BRO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE ME DO WITH THIS KNIFE. I KNOW WE'RE NOT GONNA SIT DOWN AND EAT, AND I FOR DAMN SURE AIN'T GONNA LET YOU STAB ME DOWN HERE. NO, BRO. THINK ABOUT IT, MAN. WE'RE GONNA TRY TO USE YOU AS A TRIGGER OBJECT. I DON'T KNOW, BUT THIS LITTLE AREA RIGHT HERE IS GIVING ME THE CHILLS. AS SOON AS I STOOD RIGHT HERE. I'M, LIKE, I'M NOT **** YOU, MAN. DO YOU STILL HAVE THE KNIFE IN YOUR HAND? I STILL HAVE THE KNIFE IN MY HAND. ALL RIGHT, HOLD IT JUST LIKE THAT, BRO. SEE IF YOU CAN CONNECT. LET'S TRY TO DO AN EVP SESSION. YO, I'M, LIKE, HAVING CHILLS THE WHOLE TIME I'M STANDING HERE, MAN. THE HELL IS IN THIS CORNER? YOU TALK TO IT, BRO. OKAY. IS THE GUY THAT WAS KILLED STILL HERE IN THIS AREA RIGHT NOW? DID YOU HEAR THAT? I'M GETTING CHILLS RIGHT NOW. BRO, DO YOU HEAR THAT? EVERY TIME I SAY SOMETHING, SOMETHING MOVES. YEAH, YEAH. IS THE GUY THAT WAS KILLED STILL HERE IN THIS AREA RIGHT NOW? YOU HEARD THAT? YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING IN THE BACK. SAY IT ONE MORE TIME. IS THE GUY THAT WAS KILLED STILL HERE IN THIS AREA RIGHT NOW? SOMETHING -- SOMETHING DID. I'M ON MY WAY TO MEET OUR WITNESSES, PAUL AND JULIE. HEY. A COUPLE OF PARANORMAL ENTHUSIASTS WHO HAD AN EXPERIENCE IN ROOM 109, WHICH JUST SO HAPPENS TO BE MA GREENE'S ROOM. IT'S KIND OF CONFINED, YOU KNOW? REAL TIGHT QUARTERS. THEN WE SHOULD DO AN EVP SESSION. LET'S GET THE EVP POPPING RIGHT NOW. I CAN SIT OVER HERE. YOU CAN SIT IN THE CHAIR. - OOH. - ALL RIGHT. BETWEEN THIS THING. OOH, BABY GOT A LITTLE GAS. I KNOW? I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU. I WAS GONNA ASK YOU. - JULIE. - YES. - LET'S START IT UP. - LET'S DO IT. HERE WE GO. THIS IS JUST A VOICE RECORD APP. MA, DO YOU REMEMBER US? I STAYED HERE ONE TIME. I SLEPT IN THIS VERY BED. DID YOU MAKE UP THE BED WHEN YOU GOT OUT OF IT? NO. - YOU JUST LEFT IT? - YES. MA, WE APOLOGIZE THAT HE DIDN'T MAKE UP THE BED WHEN HE LEFT. DID THAT MAKE YOU MAD? MA, THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE, WE BROUGHT BEER AND TOOK A SIP, AND WHEN I TOOK A SECOND SIP, YOU FLICKED ME ON THE ARM. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT? WE LOVE YOUR BOAT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE BACK. CAN YOU TALK TO US? WOULD IT BE GOOD TO SEE PEOPLE BACK ON THIS BOAT, TRAVELING, HAVING A GOOD TIME? WHAT WAS THAT? IT SPIKED WHEN YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION. REWIND IT. YOU WANT TO TRY TO REVIEW THOSE, - SEE IF WE GOT ANYTHING? - SURE. WE LOVE YOUR BOAT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE BACK. CAN YOU TALK TO US?

THESE GUYS ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO LEAVE MY BY MYSELF. SO, THEY HAVE CLAIMS OF HEARING DISEMBODIED VOICES, SOMETIMES FOOTSTEPS. THEY EVEN HEAR, LIKE, METAL CLANKING OF TOOLS IN THIS ENGINE ROOM. THEY GOT A PLANK. GUESS THEY WAS KICKING FOLKS OFF THIS THING. SO, I'M JUST GONNA TRY TO BE AS SILENT AS I CAN, SEE IF I CAN LET THE BOAT KIND OF SPEAK TO ME. ****! I JUST HEARD FOOTSTEPS. BRO, DID YOU HEAR THAT? THERE'S A LOT OF FOOT-- IS THAT YOU MAKING THE FOOTSTEPS IN AND ABOUT THE KITCHEN? I HEARD SOMETHING COMING FROM THAT BACK CORNER. I HEARD FOOTSTEPS. HELLO? DALEN. ****! - COME ON, MAN. - COME ON, MAN. DON'T DO THAT. BRO, WHY ARE YOU BACK THERE? BRO, I WAS BACK HERE CHECKING OUT THE ENGINE ROOM. I JUST HEARD FOOTSTEPS, BRO. BRO, THAT'S WHAT WE WERE CHASING. WE THOUGHT -- WAS THAT YOU THAT WAS BACK HERE? NO, I DIDN'T GET BACK THERE. I WAS HERE. SO, YOU WERE NOT BACK THERE IN THE KITCHEN AREA? NO. BRO, WE HEARD FOOTSTEPS. THERE'S SOMETHING MOVING AROUND IN HERE, DUDE. I'M GONNA JUST KEEP IT REAL. THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE GOING ON, AND I CAN'T PINPOINT WHERE IT'S COMING FROM AND WHY IT'S HAPPENING. IF IT IS SOMETHING, THEY'RE NOT REVEALING THEMSELVES ALL THE WAY. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FULL WAY MAY BE AND IF I'M EVEN READY FOR THAT. - GOING ON, MAN? - HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON, FELLAS? - MAN. - HOW WAS YOUR FIRST ONE? IT'S A LITTLE INTENSE, BUT I THINK I DID ALL RIGHT. - WORD? - YEAH. "ALL RIGHT" IS A STRETCH, BUT... - HOW YOU DOING, BROTHER? - GOOD, MAN. HEY, LET ME TELL YOU, ME, JULIE, AND PAUL, WE WERE IN ROOM 109. WE TRIED TO DO AN EVP RECORDING SESSION, AND WE GOT A RESPONSE, DAWG. I WAS OVER IN THE ENGINE ROOM, AND I HEARD SOME FOOTSTEPS. BRO, PAUL -- HIS STORY REAL QUICK, THOUGH, BRO, AT THE SAME TIME JUWAN HEARS HIS FOOTSTEPS, WE HEAR OUR FOOTSTEPS - COMING FROM THE SAME AREA. - WOW. WE BOTH ARE RUNNING AND RUN RIGHT INTO EACH OTHER. WOW. HOW CRAZY IS THAT, BRO? I'M TELLING YOU. THAT'S "TOM AND JERRY" STUFF, MAN. THIS SHIP IS TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING. OR THEY TRYING TO HAVE FUN WITH US. IT'S STILL EARLY IN OUR INVESTIGATION, BUT WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED CLAIMS THAT PEOPLE HAVE HEARD FOOTSTEPS AND SOUNDS AROUND THE BOAT, SO WE'RE GONNA EXPLORE MORE OF THE DELTA QUEEN TO SEE WHO OR WHAT IS BEHIND THEM. MAN, IT IS CREEPY UP HERE. ALL RIGHT, MAN, SO THIS IS ACTUALLY THE MAIN LOBBY OF THE BOAT. MAN, I'M FEELING CREEPED OUT. I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU. I THINK IT'S THE FURNITURE, MAN. THE FURNITURE LOOK LIKE IT'S HAUNTED. - LIKE, IT'S TRYING -- - IT'S THE GHOSTS OF OLD COUCHES. OF OLD COUCHES THAT HAVE DIED THAT HAVE MANY, MANY COINS IN THEM. I'M GONNA SIT RIGHT HERE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, BRO. ALL RIGHT. THIS DEFINITELY WOULD'VE BEEN AN AREA THAT CAPTAIN GREENE WOULD'VE WALKED AROUND. FOR SURE. AND THE APPARITIONS, YOU KNOW, THAT WE'VE SEEN WERE IN 19-LIKE-30s GARB. YEAH. THAT'S PROBABLY THE HEYDAY OF THIS BOAT. IT PROBABLY USED TO GO DOWN IN THE '30s. LET'S DO AN EVP SESSION, BRO. YEAH, MAN. LET'S TALK TO THEM LIKE CLASSIC RADIO DEEJAYS. OLD SCHOOL STYLE. OKAY. COOL. LET'S GO. HEY, YOU'RE ON WITH DALEN AND MARCUS. PLEASE SIT DOWN AND ENJOY YOUR JUKEBOX. YEAH. IT'S YOUR BOY, BLACK BUTTER BABY. WHAT KIND OF NAME IS THAT? - THAT'S NOT A COOL RADIO NAME? - IT IS A TERRIBLE RADIO NAME. BLACK BUTTER BABY? IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE LISTENING TO US THAT HAD SOMETHING HAPPEN TO THEM IN THIS LOBBY AREA? ARE THERE ANY PASSENGERS IN THE LOBBY AREA WITH ME AND DALEN? WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE TO HAVE A SEAT? WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE TO HAVE A DRINK? WHAT THE ****! ARE THERE ANY PASSENGERS IN THE LOBBY AREA WITH ME AND DALEN? WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE TO HAVE A SEAT? WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE TO HAVE A DRINK? WHAT THE ****! BRO. DALEN ASKED, "DO YOU WANT A DRINK?" AS SOON AS HE SAYS ALCOHOL, THE DOOR SLAMS LIKE, "DIDN'T I TELL Y'ALL DON'T BRING NO ALCOHOL?" IT JUST FELT LIKE THAT TYPE OF ENERGY. THE LOUDEST DOOR SLAM. SO, MAYBE THEY DON'T WANT A DRINK? WHEN MARCUS AND I HEARD THAT SLAM, I DAMN NEAR JUMPED OUT MY SKIN. WHAT THE ****! WE'VE HEARD OF CLAIMS OF DOORS SLAMMING, BUT TO REALLY HEAR IT, AND RIGHT AT THE END OF ME SAYING A QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I KNOW I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, WHICH IS ALCOHOL, COME ON, MAN. LIKE, SOMETHING HAS TO BE BACK HERE. BRO, COME ON, BRO. WE CAN'T HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT HAPPEN AND NOT GO. YO? WHAT'S BACK HERE? YO, THIS IS ACTUALLY WHERE ROOM 109 IS, RIGHT DOWN THIS HALL. NO WAY, BRO. LIE TO YOU, MY BROTHER? NO WAY, BRO. AND YOU REMEMBER WE HAD CLAIMS OF DOORS SLAMMING? CAPTAIN MIKE TALKED ABOUT THE DOOR SLAMMING AND STUFF. BRO. I REALLY FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING JUST, LIKE, BACK THERE JUST, LIKE, GOING -- WALKING BACK AND FORTH, BRO. WALKING BACK AND FORTH. LIKE, I FEEL THAT TYPE OF PACING ENERGY, BRO. ANXIETY. WANT TO GO AHEAD AND ENTER THIS CREW QUARTER. WATCH YOUR STEP AND USE THE HANDRAIL. THIS IS A REAL TIGHT QUARTER RIGHT HERE. IT SMELLS FUNNY DOWN HERE. IT DOES. I REALLY THINK IT'S JUST THE PRESENCE OF, LIKE, HOW MANY MEN USED TO BE DOWN HERE. LIKE, HOW MANY BODIES. YEAH. WHY THEY SAY "WELCOME TO MID CITY"? WHAT? YOU ARE IN THE CREW QUARTERS. DON'T MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THIS IS FANCY. MIGHT'VE BEEN BACK IN THE DAY. MID CITY. THIS IS BANKS STREET. YOU SEE THESE UNIFORMS, MAN? YEAH. YOU THINK THE CHEF MAY HAVE WORE SOMETHING LIKE THIS? PROBABLY, YEAH. BUT LOOK AT HOW TIGHT THIS IS. PEOPLE WERE SLEEPING DOWN HERE. IT'D BE THOUSANDS OF MEN PACKED ON THIS SHIP. THIS IS NOT CONDUCIVE FOR THAT MANY PEOPLE. WE KNOW IN THE '50s, A CREW MURDER TOOK PLACE ONBOARD WHEN THE BUTCHER KILLED THE CHEF DURING AN ARGUMENT IN THE KITCHEN. LOOKING AT HOW TIGHT THESE CREW QUARTERS ARE, YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS COULD'VE PUSHED THESE DUDES OVER THE EDGE. SEEING THIS DEFINITELY SHEDS A LOT OF LIGHT ON WHAT TOOK PLACE HERE. THIS IS DEFINITELY TIGHT. IT IS. EERIE DOWN HERE. WHAT IS THAT? LIFE PRESERVERS. THE ENERGY FEEL A LITTLE DIFFERENT TO YOU? IT DOES. I'M HEARING THE ENTIRE BOAT CREAK A LITTLE BIT, RIGHT? YEAH. IT'S LIKE SOMETHING HEAVY IS STANDING ON ONE OF THE PARTS OF THE BOAT. YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MARCUS? IT COULD BE MARCUS. THIS IS THE DOOR -- THIS IS MA GREENE'S. THIS IS WHERE THAT SOUND CAME FROM, RIGHT? YOU THINK IT WAS THIS DOOR? NO, THAT DOOR'S BEEN OPEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE INVESTIGATION. WHAT COULD HAVE SLAMMED? MARCUS, BRO, YOU'RE SCARING ME, BRO. DUDE, I JUST FEEL THIS WEIRD -- THIS REALLY WEIRD ENERGY, LIKE, RIGHT HERE. LIKE, THIS IS, LIKE, JUST FEELS LIKE THIS IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO KEEP GOING INTO. REMEMBER HOW THE CAPTAIN SAID HE HEARD A SLAMMING NOISE THAT KIND OF GOT HIS ATTENTION AND IT KIND OF LED HIM SOMEWHERE? I FEEL LIKE WE WERE LED INTO HERE. AND THAT'S RIGHT WHEN WE WERE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LIBATIONS. HOW ABOUT I GET THE REM-POD AND WE SET IT UP, BRO, AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY ENERGY GOING OVER THERE? COOL. YEAH, I WANT TO DO AN EVP, REM-POD. I WANT TO BUST OUT THAT LIGHT. ANY WAY WHATEVER SLAMMED THAT DOOR CAN COMMUNICATE WITH US... ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET ME GO -- I'M TRYING TO DO IT. LET'S GO. BRO. WHY ARE ALL THESE DOORS OPEN? ****! IS THAT WHAT -- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE, DIDN'T IT? BROTHER, IF YOU SLAM ANOTHER ONE OF THESE DOORS IN HERE, I'LL ABOUT PUNCH YOU IN YOUR FACE, AND YOU'RE TOO NICE OF A GUY FOR ME TO PUNCH YOU IN YOUR FACE. YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE, MAN. BRO, MAYBE SOMETHING PUSHED ONE OF THESE DOORS OPEN. HEY, WHY DON'T WE SET THE REM-POD UP RIGHT HERE? ALL RIGHT, DALEN, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. SO, THIS IS THE LIGHT TEST. I WANT TO SET THIS DOWN HERE, SET IT UP, AND WE'RE GONNA POP IT, ALL RIGHT? FOR SURE. SO, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS IT'LL BE ONE LIGHT FOR YES, TWO LIGHTS FOR NO. SO, WHATEVER QUESTIONS WE HAVE, WE'LL JUST PRETTY MUCH ASK IT AND IT'LL RESPOND. IF IT RESPONDS, WE STILL HAVE THE REM-POD SET UP. SO, LET'S GET STARTED. SO, ARE YOU MA GREENE? ARE YOU A CREW MEMBER? ****. THAT'S TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT TESTS, AND BOTH OF THEM WENT OFF AT THE EXACT SAME TIME. ARE YOU A CREW MEMBER? ****. HOW WOULD BOTH OF THEM GO OFF AT THE SAME TIME, BRO? THAT'S TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT TESTS, AND BOTH OF THEM WENT OFF AT THE EXACT SAME TIME. WHAT DID YOU ASK? "ARE YOU A CREW MEMBER?" ARE YOU A CREW MEMBER? AND BOTH OF THEM WENT OFF AT THE EXACT SAME TIME. THOSE ARE TWO TOTALLY SEPARATE TESTS. IT'S GOING BACK OUT. ALL RIGHT, SO NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE A CREW MEMBER, DID YOU LIKE WORKING ON THIS BOAT? DID YOU HATE WORKING ON THIS BOAT? BRO. BRO. COME ON, MAN. BRO, THIS STUFF DON'T FREAK YOU OUT, MAN? I CAN SEE WHY THEY SAY BLACK FOLKS DON'T DO THIS STUFF. RIGHT. BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU, MAN, I WOULD'VE BEEN GONE. THE REM-POD AND THE LIGHT GO OFF AT THE SAME TIME. AND THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED, BRO. SO, WHAT DO WE KNOW FOR SURE RIGHT NOW? WE KNOW THAT IT'S A CREW MEMBER HERE AND THEY HATED THEIR JOB. LET ME ASK YOU THIS. IS IT THAT YOU HATED YOUR JOB? YES, HE TOLD YOU. - YES. - OKAY, I'M SORRY. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW? SO, OBVIOUSLY HE REALLY HATED WORKING ON THIS BOAT. YOU KNOW, THEY LIVED AND WORKED IN SUCH TIGHT QUARTERS, BRO. HE JUST -- THIS CONFIRMED THAT YOU WORK IN SUCH TIGHT QUARTERS WITH EACH OTHER, IT'S A LOT OF ANIMOSITY. YOU CAN'T DRINK, YOU CAN'T RELAX, WINE, YOU CAN'T LEAVE YOUR JOB. BRO, IF YOU JUST HAD A BAD DAY AT WORK, BRO, YOU HATED YOUR JOB, BRO, WHEN YOU GOT HOME, WHAT YOU DOING? YOU SLAMMING THE DOOR, BRO. IS THAT WHY YOU HAD A BAD DAY? DID YOU GET INTO IT WITH A CO-WORKER? MAYBE IN THE KITCHEN? ****. ****. YO, DAWG. DUDE, WE GOT TO REVISIT THE KITCHEN. ALL RIGHT. NOW THAT WE KNOW WE HAVE A DISGRUNTLED CREW MEMBER ONBOARD, ME AND JASON GONNA GO BACK TO THE KITCHEN WHERE THE CHEF WAS MURDERED TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND SOME STUFF. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. I THINK I GOT THE PERFECT TRIGGER OBJECT, TOO. YOU GOT SOMETHING? MAN. I GOT US A SHRIMP PO' BOY. MAN. YOU BRINGING FOOD INTO ANOTHER CHEF'S KITCHEN. THAT'S ENOUGH TO GET ME ANGRY. YOU TRYING TO START SOMETHING, MAN. THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IT. SO, LET'S GET THE EVP RECORDING SESSION GOING, - MAN. - LET'S DO IT. I THINK WE SHOULD JUST SIT IT, LIKE, RIGHT NEXT TO THE SANDWICH. WHAT DO YOU THINK? HERE WE GO. DOES THAT UPSET YOU THAT WE BROUGHT A PO' BOY INTO YOUR KITCHEN? I'M SORRY, MAN, BUT THIS PO' BOY SMELLS REALLY GOOD RIGHT NOW. I KNOW, MAN. DO YOU ENJOY THE SMELL OF THIS PO' BOY LIKE WE DO? I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S, LIKE, TAPPING ME ON THE SHOULDER RIGHT NOW. ARE YOU SERIOUS? YEAH. AT THE BACK OF MY SHOULDER. IT'S LIKE THAT. I'M TELLING YOU IT'S THE PO' BOY, MAN. WE'VE HAD BACK-TO-BACK EXPERIENCES TONIGHT CONFIRMING THE SPIRIT OF AN UNHAPPY CREW MEMBER. NOW, HE HAS BEEN KIND OF THREATENING, BUT I AIN'T NO PUNK, AND HE'S DEFINITELY NOT SHY TO LET HIS PRESENCE BE MADE KNOWN. I FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S, LIKE, TAPPING ME ON THE SHOULDER RIGHT NOW. ONE THING I KNOW IS NO ONE DEAD OR ALIVE CAN RESIST A NICE PO' BOY. WHAT? ARE YOU EATING A SANDWICH, MAN? WE'RE DONE INVESTIGATING, RIGHT? I MIGHT BE NEW TO THIS, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO EAT THE TRIGGER OBJECT FOR THE GHOST. YOU'RE JUST GONNA EAT THE SANDWICH RIGHT HERE, MAN? WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE IT FOR HIM. COME ON, DAWG. - SHOOT. - MAN. I THINK WE SHOULD REALLY GO TAKE A SEAT UP IN THE BRIDGE. ALL RIGHT. SO, THIS WOULD BE -- THIS WOULD BE WHERE, LIKE, MA GREENE WOULD'VE DWELLED. LIKE, THIS WOULD'VE BEEN HER OFFICE. SO, IF THERE'S A BENEVOLENT SPIRIT, IT WOULD POSSIBLY DWELL IN HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? SHE'S, LIKE, THE MATRIARCH FOR THE DELTA QUEEN. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. ABSOLUTELY. SO, WE'RE GONNA DO ESSENTIALLY A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION. WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS LIGHT AND WE'RE GONNA SET IT UP ON THIS COUNTER, AND IF IT FLASHES ON, - THAT MEANS YES. - OKAY. IF IT DOESN'T FLASH, THAT MEANS NO. ALL RIGHT. I CAN'T PROCESS THE FACT THAT THIS THING MIGHT JUST LIGHT UP ON ITS OWN BY SOMETHING. I KNOW IT SEEMS A LITTLE OUT THERE, MAN, BUT I'M TELLING YOU, THIS WORLD IS OUT THERE. I'M TELLING YOU, IF THIS THING LIGHTS UP, I'M LITERALLY JUMPING OUT MY SKIN. IS THERE A BENEVOLENT SPIRIT HERE? IS CAPTAIN MA GREENE HERE? ****. IF IT FLASHES ON, THAT MEANS YES. IF IT DOESN'T FLASH, THAT MEANS NO. WE'RE ON THE BRIDGE OF THE DELTA QUEEN USING THE FLASHLIGHT TEST TO TRY AND MAKE CONTACT WITH THE SPIRIT OF FORMER CAPTAIN MA GREENE. IS CAPTAIN MA GREENE HERE? ****. ASK ANOTHER QUESTION. DID MOVING YOUR SHIP FROM CHATTANOOGA TO HOUMA, LOUISIANA, DISRUPT YOU? HEY, MAN, I GOT TO STAND UP FOR THAT ONE. MAN. I DAMN NEAR LOST IT RIGHT THERE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE IT WAS SOMETHING SPEAKING TO US THROUGH ELECTRONICS. AND THAT'S, LIKE -- I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE IN MY LIFE. ASK ABOUT THE ALCOHOL. LIKE, DID THAT MAKE HER UPSET? DOES THE PARTICIPATION OF DRINK-- YOU COULDN'T EVEN GET IT OUT. I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH THE QUESTION. LIKE, NO WAY NO HOW DID THIS WOMAN WANT TO DEAL WITH ANY TYPE OF LIBATIONS ON HER BOAT. DOES THE PARTICIPATION OF DRINK-- YOU COULDN'T EVEN GET IT OUT. SHE WAS A TEETOTALER. SHE'S NOT PLAYING ABOUT THAT DRINKING, BRO. THAT ALCOHOL, MAN, IT'S -- I GOT GOOSE BUMPS RIGHT NOW, MAN. SHE'S NOT PLAYING ABOUT THAT DRINKING. THE HUGE FLASHLIGHT RESPONSE THAT WE GOT FROM CAPTAIN MA GREENE IS SOLID EVIDENCE THAT HER SPIRIT IS STILL PRESENT ONBOARD. SO WE'RE GONNA PUSH A LITTLE MORE. LOOK AT THESE STEPS TO THE TEXAS LOUNGE. I'M LINKING UP WITH DALEN TO SEE IF WE CAN GET THE SPIRIT OF MA GREENE TO MAKE ONE OF HER REPORTED PHYSICAL APPEARANCES USING THE THINGS SHE HATES THE MOST -- LIQUOR. THIS IS THE GOOD STUFF. OKAY. ALL RIGHT, THAT 'GAC, YO. GOT A LITTLE BIT OF APPLE BRANDY. OKAY. BOOM. GIVE IT A LITTLE FLARE. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. SHE'S A LADY, SO I'M GONNA GET HER ONE OF THESE. BOO-YAH. WHOO! THERE IT IS. PUT A LITTLE TASTE IN YOU. YEAH. OOH, JUST A LITTLE BIT. HEY, LISTEN, MA GREENE, I'M GONNA SET THIS DOWN. AND IF YOU WANT TO, I WOULD BE MIGHTY, MIGHTY HAPPY IF YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK OF IT. IMMA BE HONEST, I DIDN'T GET WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA GET, MAN. I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. SHE DIDN'T LIKE ALCOHOL, SO US TRYING TO GET COMMUNICATION WITH HER USING ALCOHOL MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE BEST METHOD. YEAH. THINK SHE WAS A SMOKER? IT'S ALWAYS A LITTLE SOUL CRUSHING TO OFFER A WOMAN A DRINK AND SHE TURNS YOU DOWN. BUT KNOWING HOW MUCH THE CAPTAIN DISLIKED ALCOHOL, THE BAR SCENE JUST MAY NOT BE HER THING. YOU GET AN "A" FOR EFFORT, BRO. INSTEAD, WE'LL INVESTIGATE A COUPLE OTHER SPOTS ON THE DELTA QUEEN WHERE WE KNOW SHE HANGS OUT. WE'RE IN THE BOILER ROOM RIGHT NOW. ONE OF THE SCARIEST ROOMS, THEY SAY, ON THE BOAT. WE HAVE CLAIMS OF LOUD BANGING, DISEMBODIED VOICES. THE LOWER REGION OF THE BOAT IS ALSO WHERE MA GREENE LED CAPTAIN MIKE TO FIX THE BROKEN PIPE THAT KEPT THE BOAT FROM SINKING. SO, WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE STILL ROAMS THESE PASSAGES. IF WE COULD CONFIRM THAT THERE'S SOME ACTIVITY DOWN HERE, IT'S A GOOD SIGN MA GREENE IS STILL WATCHING OVER HER BOAT. WATCH YOUR STEP. NORMALLY, I WOULD DO THESE INVESTIGATIONS WITH NO LIGHT, BUT I AM IN UNCHARTERED WATERS, IF YOU WILL. YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE? YEAH. I SEE THAT YOU USED A WATER REFERENCE. YEP. ABSOLUTELY. GOOD JOB. ****! WAS THAT? WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT ****? WHAT WAS THAT, AND WHERE DID IT COME FROM? NO. IT WAS, LIKE -- LIKE SOMETHING FELL OFF. IT WAS LIKE A BOLT. IT SOUNDED LIKE A BOLT OR SOMETHING. ****! WAS THAT? WHERE DID YOU COME FROM? WHERE DID YOU GO? YOU KNOW, I DON'T MIND DOING THIS A LITTLE BIT LONGER, MAN. IT'S BEEN A CRAZY NIGHT. WE'VE HAD DOORS SLAM, REM-POD RESPONSES, AND EVPs ALL OVER THE BOAT. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING MOVING AROUND THAT OUR EYES JUST CAN'T PERCEIVE, SO WE'RE BRINGING OUT OUR THERMAL CAM TO HELP OUT. IT'S LIKE A HEAT SEEKER. YOU CAN PICK UP DIFFERENT BODY TEMPERATURES AND DIFFERENT HEAT, AND WE'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE, MAN, WE HAD CLAIMS OF APPARITIONS WALKING THE DECK. SO, IF THEY ARE WALKING, WE CAN CATCH THE HEAT AND WE CAN SEE THEM, MAN. SO, IF IT'S WARMER, THEN IT'S GONNA COME IN RED. RIGHT. WAIT, WAIT. FOCUS IN THAT LITTLE DOORWAY RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE? THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I WAS LOOKING. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. SOMETHING JUST POPPED OUT RIGHT THERE. SOMETHING IS MOVING. - YOU SEE IT? - YEAH. RIGHT THERE, YEAH. HOLY ****. HELLO? IT'S LIKE IT'S PEEKING ITS HEAD AROUND THE CORNER. IT JUST DISAPPEARED. IT DID JUST DISAPPEAR, BRO. IT JUST DISAPPEARED. IT DID DISAPPEAR. AND NOW IT'S BACK. THIS IS, LIKE, DEFINITELY A SPIRIT RIGHT HERE. AND IT'S, LIKE, LOOKING AT US. ****. FOR MORE "GHOST BROTHERS," DIGITAL EXCLUSIVES, FOCUS IN THAT LITTLE DOORWAY RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE? THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE I WAS LOOKING. JASON AND I WERE CHECKING OUT THE DECK OF THE DELTA QUEEN WITH OUR THERMAL CAM... WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. SOMETHING JUST POPPED OUT RIGHT THERE. SOMETHING IS MOVING. WHERE PEOPLE CLAIM TO SEE APPARITIONS, AND MAN, WE SAW SOMETHING, TOO. WHAT IS THAT? I DON'T KNOW. CAN YOU SEE IT? NO, I CAN'T SEE IT IN THERE. YOU GOT A FLASHLIGHT? AS SOON AS I DID THAT -- DUDE, IT WALKED OFF. IT JUST PEEKED OUT REAL QUICK AND IT JUST WENT BACK AS SOON AS I SHINED THE LIGHT. IT'S LIKE IT'S LOOKING BACK AND FORTH AT US RIGHT NOW. IT'S LIKE IT'S TEASING US OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TELLING US TO COME FIND IT. - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. - SOMETHING JUST POPPED UP - RIGHT THERE. - SOMETHING IS MOVING. LET'S GO BACK IN THERE, SEE IF WE CAN FIND IT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO FIND IT. - SOMETHING FELL OFF. - IT WAS LIKE A BOLT. IT SOUNDED LIKE A BOLT OR SOMETHING. MARCUS AND I WERE JUST TRYING TO SURVEY THE BOILER ROOM, AND I'M TALKING ABOUT WE HEARD THE LOUDEST CLANKING OF METAL, BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING FELL, LIKE A BOLT. **** WAS THAT? LET'S GO ON THE OTHER SIDE, MAN. YEAH. I THINK WE SHOULD DO AN EVP SESSION, MAN. THIS IS MARCUS AND JUWAN. ARE THERE ANY SPIRITS IN THE BOILER ROOM? IS IT YOU MAKING ALL THE NOISES DOWN HERE? DOES THE RENOVATION OF THE BOAT DISTURB YOU? **** WAS THAT? **** WAS THAT? IT WAS A SHUFFLE. IT WAS DEFINITELY A SHUFFLE. IT WAS A SHUFFLE. WHAT WAS THE LAST QUESTION WE ASKED ON THE EVP RECORDER? "WERE YOU DISRUPTED FROM THE MOVE AND THE RENOVATIONS?" AND THEN YOU HEAR A SCURRY? THE TALK OF RENOVATIONS SEEMED TO REALLY GET THIS PLACE RILED UP. DOES THE RENOVATION OF THE BOAT DISTURB YOU? AND SINCE THIS IS A KNOWN MA GREENE HOTSPOT. **** WAS THAT? THIS MAY BE HER WAY OF LETTING US KNOW SHE'S HERE AND NOT HAPPY ABOUT PEOPLE MESSING WITH HER BOAT. THIS IS THE EXACT AREA THAT WE CAUGHT THE IMAGE ON THE THERMAL CAM. IT WAS LIKE IT WAS PEEKING OUT RIGHT HERE, RIGHT? JASON AND I ARE CHECKING OUT AN AREA OF THE BOAT WHERE WE SPOTTED AN IMAGE ON OUR THERMAL CAM. THIS IS, LIKE, DEFINITELY A SPIRIT RIGHT HERE. AND IT'S, LIKE, LOOKING AT US. DO YOU SEE ANYTHING? I DON'T SEE ANYTHING. IF WE COULD JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT THE THERMAL CAM WAS SHOWING US, WE'D HAVE CONCRETE PROOF OF EXACTLY WHAT'S HAUNTING THIS AREA OF THE DECK. POINT IT BACK THIS WAY. IS THERE ANYTHING BEHIND ME? THERE'S NOTHING BEHIND YOU. IT WOULD'VE BEEN HERE COMING FROM THE DOOR AND KIND OF, LIKE, PEEKING OUT, RIGHT? YEAH. BRO. YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S THE KITCHEN WHERE THE CHEF WAS KILLED. THAT DEFINITELY COULD'VE BEEN THE CHEF THAT WE JUST CAUGHT ON THE THERMAL CAM. WE'VE HAD A TON OF ACTIVITY TONIGHT, AND IT FEELS LIKE A LOT OF IT POINTS TO TWO SPECIFIC PEOPLE. SO IT'S TIME TO MEET UP WITH THE GUYS AND BRING THIS INVESTIGATION TO A CLOSE. I FEEL LIKE I'M ONE OF Y'ALL. LET'S NOT GET AHEAD OF YOURSELF JUST YET. SLOW DOWN. YOU DID A GOOD JOB, MAN. HAS IT CHANGED YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT WE DO, BRO? YEAH, IT CHANGED MY PERSPECTIVE A LOT. I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE. WHEN WE WERE SITTING THERE WITH THE THERMAL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BOAT AND WE GOT STRONG READINGS. LIKE, DEFINITELY A SPIRIT RIGHT HERE. AND IT'S, LIKE, LOOKING AT US. THEN WE FIND OUT THAT THE READING IS COMING FROM A SPOT RIGHT NEXT TO THE KITCHEN. IT WOULD'VE BEEN HERE COMING FROM THE DOOR. IT DEFINITELY SUPPORTS THE CLAIMS THAT THE CHEF IS STILL HAUNTING THE KITCHEN. WE GOT A FLASHLIGHT MOMENT UP IN THE BRIDGE. IS CAPTAIN MA GREENE HERE? AND WE PROVED THAT THE BOSS IS NOT ONLY HERE, BUT THE RENOVATIONS ARE HELPING TO KEEP HER HERE. DOES THE RENOVATION OF THE BOAT DISTURB YOU? **** WAS THAT? OUR MISSION WAS TO FIND OUT IF THE DELTA QUEEN'S RECENT MOVE TO LOUISIANA WAS BEHIND THIS EXPLOSION IN PARANORMAL ACTIVITY AND IF ANY OF IT WAS THREATENING. AND BASED ON THE EVIDENCE THAT WE FOUND, WE'RE CERTAIN THAT THE MURDERED CHEF IS DEFINITELY LINGERING, AND CAPTAIN MA GREENE'S SPIRIT PROBABLY WON'T REST UNTIL THE BOAT IS RESTORED TO HER LIKING. WHICH MEANS SHE'LL MOST LIKELY BE HERE FOREVER. THIS BOAT IS HAUNTED, BRO. - STAMP IT. - FOR SURE. THERE'S A LOT OF CRAZY ENERGY ON THIS BOAT. LET'S GET UP OUT HERE. - THERE WE GO. - PEACE, JASON. SO, I CAN'T GO WITH YOU? THERE'S ROOM IN THE BACK. GHOST BROTHERS GHOSTING OUT.
