I READ ABOUT A LOT OF HAUNTED ACTIVITY GOING ON AT THIS PLACE IN SEGUIN, TEXAS... ...CALLED THE MAGNOLIA HOTEL. BRO, IT'S CRAZY. THE MAGNOLIA HOTEL WAS BUILT IN 1840. IT BECAME THE FIRST STAGECOACH STATION IN THE AREA. THE HOTEL SERVED AS AN OVERNIGHT STOP FOR THE EXHAUSTED, HUNGRY AND DIRT-COVERED RIDERS, BUT OVER TIME, IT BEGAN TO ATTRACT MORE VIOLENCE AND CRIMINALS. AND THAT'S WHEN THE HOTEL TURNED DARK. IN 1874, THE FIRST KILLING OCCURRED, AND OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES, PEOPLE STARTED DYING IN CRAZY WAYS. ONE GUY GOT OUT OF A STAGECOACH AND SHOT HIMSELF DEAD ON THE FRONT STEPS OF THE HOTEL. A GUEST USED AN AXE TO KILL A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL. A PROSTITUTE KILLED A MAN IN AN UPSTAIRS BEDROOM. AND ANOTHER DUDE, WELL, HE SLIT HIS OWN THROAT. WORD. THEY HAVE AT LEAST 13 CONFIRMED DEATHS AT THIS HOTEL, BRUH. SOUNDS LIKE THE HOTEL OF DEATH. HOTEL OF DEATH. WOULD YOU STAY AT THE HOTEL OF DEATH? I DON'T THINK SO, MAN. IS IT ON YELP? NOW OVER 100 YEARS LATER, VISITORS HAVE SEEN SPIRITS THEY BELIEVE ARE SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIED IN THIS PLACE. DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE ON THEIR OWN. CHILDREN ARE SEEN PLAYING ON THE FIRST FLOOR. AND PEOPLE HAVE ACTUALLY PHOTOGRAPHED THE SPIRIT OF A WOMAN LOOKING OUT THE FRONT WINDOW. - WORD? - YUP. MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE SOME PICTURES, TOO, YOU KNOW? SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND OUT. WE SPOKE WITH ERIN WHO OWNS THE HOTEL TODAY, AND SHE CONFIRMED THAT THERE'S BEEN RECENT ACTIVITY. AND SHE'S INVITED US TO COME AND INVESTIGATE THE HOTEL. MAN, IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS PLACE IS A MAGNET FOR, LIKE, SPIRITS, BRUH. IT MAYBE JUST HAD, LIKE, A BAD ENERGY IN THIS PLACE, MAN. IT'S JUST MAKING PEOPLE DO BAD THINGS. I FEEL LIKE THIS ONE'S ABOUT TO BE DOPE. LET'S GO, MAN. THEY CALL IT THE HOTEL OF DEATH. IT AIN'T FOR NO REASON. RIGHT. TIME TO START GHOSTING. YEAH, MAN. SO, WE OUT HERE IN SEGUIN, TEXAS, FELLAS. WELCOME TO MY HOME STATE, THE STATE THAT MADE ME, TEXAS. - OKAY. YOU KNOW, I WAS BORN HERE, TOO, IN TEXAS. THAT DON'T COUNT. I THINK IT COUNTS, MAN. SO, I HEAR DANGER IS SUPPOSED TO BE COMING THROUGH THE MAGNOLIA. BRO, ALL TYPE OF PEOPLE CAME HERE. HORSE THIEVES, STAGECOACH ROBBERS. LIKE, THIS IS GENUINELY THE WILD, WILD WEST. THEY DIDN'T CALL IT THAT FOR NOTHING, MAN. BOYS WAS OUT HERE GETTING SCALPED. A LOT OF DANGEROUS THINGS BEEN GOING ON HERE, MAN. AND THOSE CATS PROBABLY CAME THROUGH THIS HOTEL, THE MAGNOLIA. IT HAD 13 CONFIRMED DEATHS. THAT'S ONLY THE AMOUNT THAT'S BEEN REPORTED. I THINK IT WAS BAD PEOPLE IN A BAD PLACE DOING BAD THINGS FOR BAD REASONS. SO, YOU MEAN TO TELL ME FOLKS IS CHECKING IN THIS HOTEL AND APPARENTLY THEY NOT CHECKING OUT. I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR MY FELLOW GENTS BECAUSE YOU KNOW THIS HOTEL USED TO BE A STAGECOACH STOP. SO, I JUST FIGURED, MAN, WE GON' VISIT IT. WE MIGHT AS WELL ACT LIKE THEY USED TO ACT BACK IN THE DAY. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME, DAWG. THOSE ARE SOME BIG HORSES. COME ON, MAN. WE IN TEXAS, MY HOME STATE. IT'LL ONLY BE BEFITTING IF WE PULL UP IN A HORSE AND CARRIAGE LIKE THEY USED TO DO IN THE OLD DAYS. - IS THERE AN AIRBAG? - THEY DON'T HAVE AIRBAGS. YOU KNOW, WE HAD A PERFECTLY GOOD CAR. WHY ARE WE IN A HORSE AND CARRIAGE, BRUH? BRO, WHAT OTHER WAY WOULD YOU WANT TO RIDE THROUGH THE TOWN, BABY? IN A CAR? - SNAP. - WOW, MAN. - IS THAT A BIG-ASS PECAN? - BRO! THE WORLD'S BIGGEST PECAN. TEXAS CAN SAY THEY HAVE THE WORLD'S LARGEST PECAN. EVERYTHING'S BIGGER HERE, AND I GROW SOME BIG NUTS. - HEY, I... - HE GROWS SOME BIG NUTS. HEY. HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE MAGNOLIA HOTEL? WELL, I'VE HEARD IN THE PAST THAT IT'S HAUNTED. HAVE YOU DRIVEN PAST IT, BEEN -- BEEN IN THERE? I'VE DRIVEN BY THERE. I'VE NEVER STAYED THERE. I DON'T -- I DON'T KNOW IF I'D HAVE THE GUTS TO. YOU KNOW WHAT'S CRAZY? IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE IN SEGUIN KNOWS A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THE MAGNOLIA HOTEL. UPSTAIRS, IT IS SAID THAT THERE WAS A YOUNG LADY, AND SHE DIED THERE IN THE HOTEL. AND HER SPIRIT STILL ROAMS THE UPSTAIRS ROOMS. I WAS GOING OVER THERE ONE NIGHT JUST TO DO A CHECK OF THE BUILDING. THE TOP WINDOW UPSTAIRS, THE LIGHT WAS ON, SO I DROVE AROUND THE BUILDING. AND WHEN I CAME BACK AROUND, THE LIGHT WAS TURNED OFF. I CONTACTED DISPATCH AND, NOT ONLY DID I LEARN THAT NO ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE, BUT THERE IS NO ELECTRICITY UPSTAIRS. - GET OUT OF HERE. - WHAT? WE'RE ON THIS JOURNEY TO THE MAGNOLIA HOTEL. YES. YOU SAID YES LIKE YOU KNOW ABOUT IT. THEY SAY IT HAS GHOSTS. YOU ALL RIGHT, MARCUS? MY THROAT IS KIND OF CLOSING UP, BUT IT'S ALL GOOD. BREATHE THROUGH YOUR NOSE, BABY. BREATHE THROUGH YOUR NOSE. YOU HAVE TO STOP TALKING. JUST HOLD YOUR MOUTH OPEN. WHAT? SO, WE'RE ON THIS HORSE AND CARRIAGE RIDE. AND THE CLOSER WE GET TO THE HOTEL, THE WORSE I GET. THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, I START FEELING, LIKE, LIGHT-HEADED AND DIZZY AND A LITTLE NAUSEATED. THE FELLAS COULD TELL THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG, SO I HAD TO GET OFF THAT CARRIAGE AND CHECK ABOUT MY HEALTH. I GOT TO DO THIS SOME OTHER WAY, BRUH. CAN'T DO IT? - HEY! MARCUS. - YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN? - NO, MAN. - WHAT'S WRONG? I CANNOT BREATHE, BRUH. WHAT, YOU THINK IT'S THE HOUSE? DUDE, IT GOT TO BE SOMETHING, MAN. YO, I'M -- I'M GONNA CALL 9-1-1, MAN. BRUH, I CANNOT BREATHE, DAWG. BRO, COME ON, MAN. OUR FELLOW FRIEND HERE, HE CAN'T BREATHE RIGHT NOW. SIR, WHAT'S GOING ON? LIKE, I LOST ALL BREATH, DAWG. I CANNOT BREATHE RIGHT NOW, MAN. THE AMBULANCE SHOWS UP. THE PARAMEDICS CHECK ME OUT, AND THEN THEY TAKE ME AWAY. I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN TO ME BEFORE. HONESTLY, IT'S AS IF THE HOTEL ITSELF DOESN'T WANT ME ANYWHERE NEAR IT. YOU ALWAYS SAY, LIKE, THIS HOUSE MAY HAVE A HOLD ON PEOPLE, MAN. DO YOU THINK IT'S, LIKE, SOMETHING IS KEEPING MARCUS FROM GOING IN OR KEEPING US FROM GOING IN FOR THAT MATTER? DO YOU THINK IT'S THE HOTEL, BRO? I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW, BRO. WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO, JUST MAKE UP AN ANSWER? I DON'T KNOW. - I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE ANSWER MY QUESTION. - I DON'T KNOW. SO, WE'RE IN SEGUIN, TEXAS, TO CHECK OUT THE HOTEL OF DEATH, THE MAGNOLIA HOTEL. BUT AS WE STARTED TO PULL UP TO THE HOTEL, SOMETHING SCARY HAPPENED TO MARCUS. I CANNOT BREATHE RIGHT NOW, MAN. AND NOW HE'S AT THE HOSPITAL. SO, ME AND JUWAN ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS INVESTIGATION. WE'RE GONNA MEET MAGNOLIA HOTEL OWNERS ERIN AND JIM... I'M DALEN. - HEY, DALEN. HOW ARE YOU? ...TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THESE GHOST STORIES. SO, JIM AND ERIN, YOU GUYS HAVE TO TELL US WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AT THE HOTEL. WE HAVE A LOT OF VISITORS THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY GET TO SEE. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S ACTIVITY IN EVERY SINGLE ROOM OF THIS HOUSE. IF YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT THIS, THERE WAS A 10-ROOM HOTEL ABOVE US. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 174 YEAR OF PEOPLE COMING AND GOING. THERE'S A LOT OF ENERGY IN THE BUILDING. WHEN JIM AND I FOUND THIS BUILDING, AND WE DECIDED THAT WE WERE GONNA, YOU KNOW, RENOVATE IT, WE WERE TOASTING. WE DID IT. WE SIGNED THE PAPERS. AND JUST AS SOON AS WE CLINKED, THE DOORS ALL SLAMMED. WE FELT THIS COLD BREEZE BETWEEN US, AND WE BOTH WENT, "WE'RE NOT ALONE." YUP, THAT WAS A MISTAKE. WELL, WE'RE EXCITED TO TOUR AND GET THIS INVESTIGATION STARTED. OKAY. SOUNDS GOOD. THIS IS OUR CHILDREN'S ROOM. WHEN WE STARTED RESTORING THE BUILDING, I FOUND THIS HIDDEN DOOR RIGHT HERE. AND I GOT ALL EXCITED ABOUT IT, AND I STARTED TAKING PICTURES TO SHOW MY HUSBAND. AND WHEN I GOT ON THE THIRD PICTURE, I CAPTURED MY VERY FIRST GHOST PICTURE. AND, IF YOU NOTICE, IT'S ACTUALLY A -- A CHILD, AND THEY'RE PLAYING LIKE THIS WITH THE FINGERS. SO, THAT'S WHEN I KNEW WE HAD CHILDREN HERE. SO, THAT WAS MY FIRST GHOST PICTURE. - I DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT. - I DON'T EITHER. I'M GON' BE HONEST WITH YOU. I'M TRYING. CAN YOU JUST SHARE SOME OF THE OTHER CLAIMS THAT GO ON HERE? YOU GO IN THE SMOKE ROOM, AND THAT'S WHERE JAMES CAMPBELL LIKES TO HANG OUT. AND, IF YOU SIT ON THE LEDGE, HE'LL BOUNCE IT UP. I THINK IT'S JUST HIS WAY OF ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HE'S IN THE ROOM. AND THE BALLROOM IS WHERE OUR WEEPING WOMAN IS KNOWN TO BE. I THINK SHE'S STILL WAITING FOR HER SWEETHEART TO GET OFF THE STAGE. LET ME TELL YOU THIS ABOUT ERIN. NOW, IF YOU KEEP ON WALKING... HOMEGIRL LIKES TO TALK. SHE HAS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT THIS PLACE AND ALL THE SPIRITS THAT HAUNT IT. SHE ACTUALLY HAS A FOLLOWING, AND PEOPLE BRING THEIR TOYS TO OUR FRONT PORCH... YOU WOULD NEED A SPREADSHEET TO FIGURE ALL THIS OUT. SO, LET A BROTHER BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU. OF THE 13 SPIRITS THAT ERIN CLAIMS HAUNT THIS PLACE, HERE ARE THE ONES YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT. THESE EVENTS HAPPENED OVER A 20-YEAR SPAN STARTING IN 1874. NUMBER ONE, THE PINK BATHROOM UPSTAIRS IS SUPPOSEDLY HAUNTED BY THE SPIRIT OF A PREGNANT WOMAN WHO KILLED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS JILTED BY HER LOVER. NUMBER TWO, THE BASEMENT, WHICH ERIN SAYS IS HAUNTED BY THE GHOST OF THE TEXAS RANGER WHO BUILT THE PLACE THEN GOT SCALPED BY THE COMANCHES. NUMBER THREE, THE PROSTITUTE'S ROOM. THIS IS WHERE A PROSTITUTE NAMED PINK ROSEBUD STABBED A JOHN WHO REFUSED TO PAY UP. SUPPOSEDLY, PINK ROSEBUD IS STILL UP THERE LOOKING FOR HER MONEY ON THE NIGHTSTAND. NUMBER FOUR IS ITZY'S ROOM. ITZY IS A LITTLE GIRL WHOSE MOTHER LOCKED HER IN A CLOSET AND LET HER SUFFER FOR DAYS, ALL WHILE MOM TURNED TRICKS IN THE ROOM NEXT DOOR. AND NUMBER FIVE IS WILLIAM FAUST'S ROOM, HAUNTED BY THE BIGGEST, BADDEST SPIRIT IN THE HOTEL, THE DUDE WHO CHOPPED UP A LITTLE GIRL WITH AN AXE THINKING IT WAS HIS WIFE. WHEN HE REALIZED HIS MISTAKE, HE TRIED TO CORRECT IT BY PUTTING THAT AXE IN HIS WIFE'S FACE. HE HAS KNOWN TO SCRATCH... ERIN SAYS FAUST HATES FEMALE GUESTS SO MUCH, HE SCRATCHES THEIR EYES. SHE'S TOO AFRAID TO EVEN ENTER THAT ROOM. SO, WHAT TOOK ABOUT 90 SECONDS TO TELL YOU TOOK 90 MINUTES TO HEAR. I SAVED US ALL A LOT OF TIME. YOU CAN THANK ME LATER. HEY, IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A LOT GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE. - CESSPOOL. - I THINK WE'RE GONNA WAIT TILL NIGHTFALL. - OKAY. WE'RE GONNA COME BACK IN HERE AND INVESTIGATE THIS PLACE. - GOOD LUCK. - LET'S BLOW THIS JUKE JOINT. OUR MISSION IS TO DETERMINE IF THE EVIL EVENTS THAT OCCURRED AT THIS HOTEL ARE THE LINK TO A CONTINUED PRESENCE OF THREATENING SPIRITS. THE ONLY THING THAT ALL THESE UNCONNECTED EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES HAVE IN COMMON IS THE MAGNOLIA HOTEL. SO, HOPEFULLY OUR BOY MARCUS WILL BE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL FOR OUR INVESTIGATION TONIGHT BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED HIM FOR THIS. EXCUSE ME. SO, IT'S ONLY TELEMUNDO? YO, WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF GOING ON TONIGHT, MAN. NOW WE JUST GOT TO WAIT ON MARCUS. YOU THINK HE COMING? I MEAN, WE CAN SEND UP A PRAYER. THAT'S ABOUT ALL WE CAN DO WITH MARCUS. - MOMENT OF SILENCE? - MOMENT OF SILENCE. WHO IS THAT? YO, WHAT'S UP, MAN? WHAT'S UP, BABY? HEY. - HEY, DAWG. STUPID HOUSE TRIED TO TAKE ME OUT, BUT I'M HERE, BOY. ALL I KNOW IS THE CLOSER I GOT TO THE HOUSE, THE LESS I COULD BREATHE. BUT WHETHER IT WAS THE HOUSE OR NOT, I'M FEELING GOOD RIGHT NOW, AND I'M READY TO INVESTIGATE. THIS HOUSE AIN'T GON' BEAT ME, AND IT AIN'T GON' BEAT US. DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GON' DO? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO? I'M ABOUT TO POP THE TRUNK ON THESE GHOSTS. BOOM, BOOM. LET'S GO. YEAH, BOY. - LET'S GET TO IT. - THERE IT IS. LISTEN, I STOPPED, AND I GOT SOME MORE STUFF FOR US. - WHAT'D YOU GET FOR US? - LET'S CHECK IT OUT. HERE'S THE GAME PLAN. WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUR GHOST BROTHERS EQUIPMENT, AND WE'RE GONNA SPLIT UP IN PAIRS. THAT'S RIGHT, PAIRS. WHILE MY HOMEBOY MARCUS WAS LAID UP IN THE HOSPITAL, WE REACHED OUT TO A LOCAL GHOST HUNTER NAMED MARK. MARK HAS ALREADY DONE HIS OWN INVESTIGATION OF THE MAGNOLIA HOTEL. SO, HE'S GONNA BE A HUGE HELP TO US TONIGHT. BUT SINCE MARCUS IS BACK, NOW WE HAVE MARK AND MARCUS BECAUSE THE SHOW MUST STILL GO ON. THIS IS THE REPLACEMENT? THIS IS THE GUY. I DIDN'T TELL YOU, MAN. YOU'RE AUDITIONING FOR HIS SPOT. THAT'S GREAT. NO, IT'S NOT GREAT. SO, ME AND THE NEW MARCUS ARE ACTUALLY GONNA GO UPSTAIRS TO THE PINK BATHROOM AND DO OUR INVESTIGATION. I FEEL LIKE THE OLD MARCUS AND JUWAN... NEW MARCUS, OLD MARCUS. COOL. - WHAT? ...SHOULD DEFINITELY GO INTO THE BASEMENT AND HOLD IT DOWN. - ALL RIGHT, BRO. - WE GOT THAT COVERED. MARK, LET THE BEST MAN WIN. THAT'S NEW MARK TO YOU. THERE IT IS. I LIKE THE WAY HE MOVE. YOU WANT MY SPOT, FLASH? SO, MARK, MAN, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT SITTING IN THE PINK BATHROOM? I CAN DO THAT. THAT'S NO PROBLEM. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS ACTUALLY WHERE A WOMAN BACK IN THE DAY, MAN, SHE WAS PREGNANT BY A MIGRANT WORKER. SHE WAS WAITING FOR HIM TO COME SAVE HER. HE NEVER CAME. SHE GOT DEPRESSED AND KILLED HERSELF IN THE BATHTUB. I THOUGHT IT'D BE COOL, MAN, MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LITERALLY SIT DOWN AND JUST HAVE LITERALLY THAT QUIET MOMENT. I'LL TAKE THE TOILET. WE CAN RUN SOME EVPs. GREAT. EVPS OR ELECTRONIC VOICE PHENOMENA ARE SPIRIT VOICES THAT WE TRY TO CAPTURE ON OUR RECORDERS BY ASKING QUESTIONS AND SEEING IF THEY RESPOND. LET'S BEGIN. SO, IS THERE ANYONE UP HERE IN THE ROOM WITH US RIGHT NOW? DOES WILLIAM FAUST LIVE ON THIS FLOOR? THAT'S ABOUT WHEN I'D STOP AND PLAY BACK. I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU, MARK. - YEAH? - I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS. BECAUSE IF I HEAR SOMETHING, I'M PROBABLY GONNA **** MYSELF. - YOU WANT THE TOILET? - NOPE. NOPE. I'M GOOD, MAN. - OKAY. JUST WANT TO HEAR AND SEE WHAT WE CAUGHT IF WE CAUGHT ANYTHING. SO, IS THERE ANYONE UP HERE IN THE ROOM WITH US RIGHT NOW? DOES WILLIAM FAUST LIVE ON THIS FLOOR? WHAT THE **** WAS THAT? BRO, THIS HOUSE IS JUST, LIKE... IT'S A LOT OF NOISES AND... - A LOT OF NOISES. - ...ENERGY AND... WELL, THE DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE A LOT BY THEMSELVES. AND IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE WE WOULD CAPTURE EVP... WHAT IN THE... - COME ON, MAN. - THAT DOOR JUST... THIS HOUSE IS JUST, LIKE... IT'S A LOT OF NOISES AND... - A LOT OF NOISES. - ...ENERGY AND... WELL, THE DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE A LOT BY THEMSELVES. AND IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE WE WOULD CAPTURE EVP... WHAT IN THE... - COME ON, MAN. - THAT DOOR JUST... WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR? NOBODY. NOBODY TO MAKE THIS DOOR DO WHAT IT JUST... YOU FELT AND HEARD THAT... YEAH, THE KNOB TURNED. WE HEAR THIS DOOR RATTLE... WHAT IN THE... ...AS IF SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO LIGHTLY, SLIGHTLY OPEN IT. I OPENED THE DOOR, AND IT'S THE NEXT ROOM, BUT NO ONE'S IN THERE. IT HAPPENED RIGHT AS WE STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS AGAIN AND REVIEWING THE EVIDENCE. YEAH, MAN. I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY, BRO, THAT SOME QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED IN HERE, MAN. WE MIGHT NOT KNOW WHO'S IN HERE, BUT I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT SOMETHING INHABITS THIS BATHROOM, BRO. I CAN CERTAINLY AGREE TO THAT. THIS LOOKS LIKE A BUNKER. DUDE, IF PEOPLE ARE GETTING SCALPED... I MEAN, BUT THIS IS WHERE THEY CAME TO HIDE SO THEY WOULDN'T GET SCALPED. BUT THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. THAT'S -- THAT'S WHAT A BUNKER PRETTY MUCH IS. WE'RE DOWN HERE IN THE BASEMENT. THIS USED TO BE AN INDIAN RAID SHELTER. I MEAN, THIS IS WHERE ANYBODY STAYING IN THE HOTEL USED TO COME DOWN HERE AND HIDE, TRY TO COME TO SAFETY FROM THE COMANCHES. SO, WE'RE DOWN HERE. WE'RE GONNA CHECK IT OUT. THEY HAVE A COUPLE OF CLAIMS OF BLACK MASS, APPARITIONS. WE'RE GONNA SEE IF WE CAN GET TO THE BOTTOM OF SOME OF THIS, MAN. YO, IT'S HOT DOWN HERE, MAN. I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS AIR IS REALLY THICK. SOMETHING WENT DOWN DOWN HERE. YO, IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE THIS HOUSE IS BREATHING ON ITS OWN. GOT ME WITH MY BIG THIGH RAG OUT. GOT ME WITH MY BIG THIGH RAG... SHH. WHAT IS THAT? WHAT WAS THAT? THAT. WHAT IS THAT? - YO, BRUH. SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S WALKING UPSTAIRS. SHH. SHH. SHH. - YOU HEAR THAT? - YEAH. THERE'S SOMEBODY ON THE FLOOR RIGHT ABOVE US. WHERE DID DALEN SAY HE WAS GOING? THEY'RE ON THE TOP FLOOR. WE'RE IN THE BASEMENT. THERE'S NOBODY ON THE, YOU KNOW, MAIN FLOOR. WE GOT TO CHECK THAT OUT. COME ON. CHECK THAT OUT. CAN YOU SEE? - NOPE. WATCH YOUR HEAD, DAWG. **** **** YOU GONNA HAVE A CONCUSSION, BOY. SO, MARK, A.K.A. NEW MARCUS, HIM AND I ARE IN THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE HOTEL RIGHT BELOW THE ATTIC SPACE WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN CLAIMS OF ALL TYPE OF SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY. WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE INVESTIGATING? I WAS STANDING HERE FEELING UNEASY, AND I GOT THAT TINGLY SENSATION ON MY ARM, AND I GOT NAUSEOUS. - RIGHT, RIGHT. - BUT IT GOT REALLY INTENSE. AND I'M LIKE, "THAT'S IT. I GOT TO GO." AND IMMEDIATELY UPON EXITING THE BUILDING, I FELT NORMAL. MANY PSYCHICS AND MEDIUMS, SOMETHING ABOUT THIS INNER SECTION OF HALLWAYS, IT FREAKS THEM OUT, AND THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE. AND THEY ALWAYS POINT UP TO THE ATTIC AND SAY, "YOUR ANSWERS ARE UP THERE." WOULD YOU GO UP THERE? I PROBABLY WOULD IF YOU GIVE ME A LADDER. - RIGHT HERE. - MAN. DUDE, IF TODAY AIN'T OUR LUCKY DAY, HOMIE. THANKFULLY, I ALWAYS CARRY A FLASHLIGHT WITH ME. SEE, YOU ALREADY BETTER THAN MARCUS NUMBER ONE ALREADY. MY GOSH. IT'S PRETTY -- **** THAT'S DIRT. MY BAD. IT'S A VERY HEAVY DOOR. OKAY. ARE THERE ANY ANSWERS UP THERE OR ARE THE PSYCHICS FULL OF ****? WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO POINT THE CAMERA? YOU WANT ME TO JUST HAND YOU THE CAMERA? SURE. I SEE A LOT OF ELECTRICAL WIRES. I JUST GOT A REALLY UNEASY FEELING UP HERE. - OKAY. - I'M GONNA HAND THIS BACK DOWN TO YOU. - ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO COME DOWN... I THINK I, - I THINK I DISTURBED SOMETHING. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. WHAT DID -- WHAT WAS THE SENSATION THAT YOU FELT UP THERE? I JUST FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS COMING UP BEHIND ME. RIGHT. AND IT'S A SCARY FEELING WHEN IT'S JUST YOUR HEAD, AND SOMETHING'S COMING AT YOUR HEAD. RIGHT. BUT YOU DEFINITELY FELT SOME TYPE OF PRESENCE? YES, FOR SURE. MARCUS, THIS IS THE BALLROOM. THEY WERE DOING ALL TYPES OF CUTTING A RUG UP HERE, MAN. AND THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE. WAS THERE ANY TYPE OF CLAIMS UP HERE? THEY SAY A WOMAN USED TO WAIT FOR HER LOVER TO RETURN ON A STAGECOACH. THEY SAID PEOPLE USED TO TAKE PICTURES AND SEE HER IN THE WINDOW WAITING. HEY, BRO. OBVIOUSLY, WE DONE CAME UP HERE. WE DON'T SEE NOBODY UP HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN DO? I'LL STAY UP HERE. I'M GON' GIVE YOU ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO GET DOWNSTAIRS. I'M-A WALK AROUND THE WHOLE THING, AND YOU TELL ME IF YOU HEAR ME. OKAY. I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE BASEMENT. SO, JUWAN'S ON HIS WAY DOWNSTAIRS. I'M GONNA STAND WHERE I HEARD THE STEPS BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE WE GOT THE CAMERAS SET UP RIGHT OVER THERE. IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO CATCH MY HANDSOME FACE. HEY, LADIES. WELL, FORGET THE LADIES. HEY, BABY, MY WIFE. - YO, MARCUS? - YOU READY? I HEAR YOU CLEAR AS DAY. OKAY, LISTEN. MY GOSH. MARCUS. WHAT'S UP? THAT IS, LIKE, ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THOSE STEPS WE HEARD. THE SOUND WE HEARD BEFORE, THAT WAS FOOTSTEPS. I'M PUTTING THAT ON EVERYTHING I LOVE. WHEN YOU HEAR -- WHEN YOU HEAR A BLACK PERSON SAY, "I'M PUTTING IT ON EVERYTHING I LOVE," THAT MEANS THAT IT'S SERIOUS. THAT'S LIKE SAYING, "HEY, I PUT THAT ON MY MAMA." THAT MEANS HIS MAMA, HIS NIECE, HIS NEPHEW, HIS GODKIDS, HIS BABY, HIS BABY MAMA, HIS WIFE... I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS ALL THAT IN HIS LIFE. I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, IT'S SOMETHING GOING ON UP THERE. THIS HOUSE IS CRAZY. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE IS MORE LIKE -- JUST A RANDOM CAT JUST GONNA WALK OVER HERE. DO YOU HEAR THAT MOVING 'CAUSE THAT'S THE CAT? UNLESS THAT CAT WEARS A SIZE 12 SHOE, I'M PRETTY SURE IT WASN'T IT. 'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT, YOU KNOW, MEN WITH BIG FEET? THEY GOT BIG SHOES. SO, WE KNOW IT AIN'T THE CAT. THIS IS THE PROSTITUTE ROOM. I'VE BEEN THROUGH A WHORE HOUSE BEFORE, SO I KNOW THE RULES AND REGULATIONS AND HOW THEY OPERATE. YOU GOT TO KNOCK FIRST. WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE TO LEARN FROM YOU ON THIS ONE. I DON'T HAVE QUITE THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN THAT FIELD. HEY, MAN, LISTEN, MAN. YOU WITH ME, BROTHER. I GOT YOU. I GOT YOU. SO, WE'RE HERE IN WHAT WAS ONCE THE PROSTITUTE'S ROOM. PINK ROSEBUD WAS HER NAME. PINK ROSEBUD, JUST HOW I LIKE THEM. BUT THE THING IS, SHE KILLED ONE OF HER JOHNS, RIGHT? YEAH. ONE OF THEM WAS THROWN OUT THIS DOOR THAT'S BEHIND YOU. YEAH. YEAH. I THINK HE WAS SHORT ON THAT CASH, AND SHE STABBED HIM. HE DIDN'T DIE, SO THEN SHE PUSHED HIM OUT THE DOOR, AND HE FELL OUT AND WAS KILLED. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT. I WOULD LOVE TO DO AN EVP SESSION IN HERE. OKAY. DO YOU HAVE UNFINISHED BUSINESS IN THIS HOTEL? DO YOU PREFER TO BE CALLED A LADY OF THE NIGHT OR A WORKING GIRL? ARE YOU TAKING ON NEW CLIENTELE? I HAVE $15 CASH. I KNOW BACK IN YOUR DAY THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY. WILL THAT MAKE YOU COME OUT RIGHT NOW? LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN HEAR. DO YOU PREFER TO BE CALLED A LADY OF THE NIGHT OR A WORKING GIRL? ONE OF MY CHICKS, MAN. MY BAD. HOW APPROPRIATE. ARE YOU TAKING ON NEW CLIENTELE? - I HAVE $15... - DO YOU HEAR THAT? - A - YEAH. I HEARD THAT, FOR SURE. I HAVE $15 CASH. THAT'S A WOMAN'S VOICE.

THAT'S A WOMAN. - IT'S VERY HIGH-PITCHED. - THAT'S CRAZY. I'M EXCITED THAT I GOT SOMETHING, MAN. SINCE WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF THE EVENTS FROM THE HOTEL ARE CONNECTED TO THESE SPIRITS, MARK AND I JUST CONDUCTED AN EVP SESSION IN THE PROSTITUTE'S ROOM. WE HEARD A WOMAN'S VOICE GASP. IT WAS THE CRAZIEST THING EVER. LET ME SAVE THIS AS, "CREEPY AS ****" - PIMP EDITION. - RIGHT, RIGHT. THERE'S DEFINITELY A PRESENCE IN THERE WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT. I FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD BE REWARDED FOR YOUR EFFORTS. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU SOME MONEY, AND I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE IT ON YOUR NIGHTSTAND. THE LAST GUY THAT SHORTED HER DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT THIS HOUSE ALIVE, SO I HAD TO LEAVE HER SOME MONEY ON THE DRESSER. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK. ARE YOU TAKING ON NEW CLIENTELE? I HAVE $15 CASH... DID Y'ALL HEAR IT? YOU HEAR THE IT WAS LIKE A THAT'S KIND OF CRAZY, FELLAS. SO, JUST TO RECAP REAL QUICK, YOU HAD THE DOORKNOB. NOW, THAT'S DEFINITELY CRAZY. AND THEN Y'ALL HAD THE INHALE, RIGHT? WE HAD THE FOOTSTEPS GOING ON. MAN, IT SEEMS LIKE WE GOT A LOT OF CRAZY THINGS ALREADY, AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN GONE THROUGH THE WHOLE HOUSE. RIGHT, RIGHT. YOU KNOW, MARCUS NUMBER ONE, 'CAUSE YOU'RE NUMBER ONE NOW IN MY EYES, I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR COMING OUT, MAN. - YES. - HEY, BROTHER, LISTEN. - ALL RIGHT. - THANK YOU FOR STEPPING UP, MAN. - YEAH, YEAH. - YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU PUT YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR THE GHOST BROTHERS, OBVIOUSLY, THEY DON'T CARE. BUT LISTEN, HEY, IT'S ALL LOVE. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU, BROTHER. I HAVE -- HEY, I HAVE NO HARD FEELINGS WITH YOU, BROTHER. GO AHEAD. - ALL RIGHT. TAKE YOUR EXIT, MAN. HERE'S JUWAN. - GOODBYE, OLD MARK. - HEY. I HATE TO SEE MARK GO, BUT I GOT ANOTHER GUY COMING IN, A LOCAL PSYCHIC NAMED BRIAN, WHO MAY BE ABLE TO PICK UP SOME VIBES AND HOPEFULLY SHED SOME LIGHT ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE. SINCE THERE HAVE BEEN CLAIMS OF APPARITIONS IN THE WINDOWS, MARCUS IS GONNA GO OUTSIDE TO TAKE PICTURES TO SEE IF HE CAN CAPTURE ANY IN HIS PHOTOS WHILE JUWAN AND I ARE GONNA TOUR THE HOUSE WITH BRIAN. HEY. HOW IT'S GOING, BRIAN? - HEY, HOW ARE YOU? - GOOD, GOOD. I'M DALEN, MAN. I'M THE GUY YOU SPOKE WITH. - I'M BRIAN. NICE TO MEET YOU. - THIS IS MY PARTNER, JUWAN. - HI, NICE TO MEET YOU. - HOW YOU DOING, BRIAN? SO, BRIAN, MAN, WE CALLED YOU OUT BECAUSE THIS HOTEL HAS A LOT OF CRAZY CLAIMS, A LOT OF VIOLENT HISTORY HERE. AND IT'S JUST STUFF THAT WE CAN'T EXPLAIN. WE NEED SOME REAL ANSWERS, SO WE CALLED IN A PROFESSIONAL. - AWESOME. - DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE HOTEL ITSELF CAN JUST DRIVE PEOPLE TO DO VIOLENT THINGS? IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED. - OKAY. - JUST LIKE THINGS CAN STORE POSITIVE ENERGY... ...PLACES CAN STORE NEGATIVE ENERGY. BUT IT IS LIKE HANGING OUT WITH THE WRONG CROWD. - RIGHT. - YOU CAN ALLOW YOURSELF TO -- TO BE MANIPULATED LIKE A PUPPET. WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU WALK AROUND AND JUST TELL US WHAT YOU CAN FIND, TELL US IF YOU FEEL ANYTHING, IF YOU SENSE ANYTHING, IF YOU KNOW THE LOTTO NUMBERS FOR NEXT WEEK. WHATEVER YOU KNOW AND WHATEVER CAN HELP US OUT. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A CHANCE TO WALK THROUGH THE HOUSE AND KIND OF GET THE LAY OF THE LAND. FOR SURE. WE'RE RIGHT BEHIND YOU, MAN. LET US KNOW ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE YOUR PROCESS EASIER. SO, THEY'VE BEEN HAVING A LOT OF CLAIMS THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A LADY WHO SITS IN THE FRONT WAITING FOR HER LOVER. AND SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY ACTUALLY GOT SOME PICTURES OF HER WAITING THERE. THERE'S BEEN REPORTS OF FIGURES BEING IN THESE WINDOWS. I'M GON' FIND IT 'CAUSE SEE, I AIN'T GONNA JUST NOT DO STUFF. YOU'RE LOVELY. GIVE IT TO ME. YOU'RE LOVELY. YOU'RE A TIGER. GIVE ME MORE. GIVE ME MORE. YES. YOU'RE FIERCE. LOOK LIKE A FIGURE IN THERE. THAT'S THE DOLL THAT THEY GOT IN THE WINDOW. BROTHER, I THOUGHT THAT WAS A GHOST. ARE YOU FEELING ANYTHING IN HERE, BRIAN, OR...? IT'S -- IT'S LIKE THE ENERGY IS LIKE -- IT'S LIKE A PACING KIND OF -- KIND OF... LIKE SOMETHING'S PACING IN THE ROOM? YEAH. LIKE, THAT -- LIKE, IT -- IT MAKES -- LIKE, MAKES ME ANTSY. - OKAY. - AND, AND -- AND, KIND OF ANXIOUS. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THE FEET JUST KIND OF LIKE TO GO WHERE THEY LIKE TO GO. INVESTIGATING IS CRAZY. YOU KNOW, THEY ALWAYS TALK ABOUT HOW THE BLACK GUY ALWAYS DIES FIRST. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN ALL OF US ARE BLACK GUYS? WHO DIES FIRST? 'CAUSE I'M, LIKE, THE SEXIEST ONE OF ALL OF THEM, SO, LIKE, I COULDN'T DIE FIRST. I'M TRYING TO BE, LIKE, THE HERO, RIGHT. SO, WE'RE UP HERE NOW, THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE HOME. MUCH MORE BUSY. GOOSE BUMPS. - OKAY. - SO, WE'RE GETTING CLOSER. - OKAY. THESE ARE MY FAVORITE ROOMS SO FAR. GOSH. I FEEL LIKE THERE'S DEFINITELY A LOT MORE SPIRIT ACTIVITY. THAT'S KIND OF DOPE, MAN. THESE ARE THE TWO ROOMS THAT WE HAD SOME CLAIMS IN. YEAH. THERE'S ACTIVITY IN BOTH OF THESE, SO... JUST WANT TO FINISH CHECKING THIS GUY OUT. WE'RE GOING INTO THE ROOM WHERE WILLIAM FAUST STAYED WHEN HE LIVED AT THIS HOTEL. HE KILLED A LITTLE GIRL WITH THAT AXE. I SAW YOU LOOK AT YOUR ARM. YEAH. THE GOOSE BUMPS ARE -- ARE GETTING STRONGER. WELL, NOT TO SOUND DRAMATIC, BUT THIS MAY SOUND A LITTLE DRAMATIC. I FEEL LIKE A PASSING, BUT A VIOLENT PASSING. - A VIOLENT PASSING? - YEAH. THAT WENT HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY. THIS FEELS LIKE A WOMAN WHO IS BEING ATTACKED. I THOUGHT I HEARD SCREAMS. THE GOOSE BUMPS ARE -- ARE GETTING STRONGER. I FEEL LIKE A PASSING, BUT A VIOLENT PASSING. - A VIOLENT PASSING? - YEAH. THAT WENT HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY, HORRIBLY. YEAH. I THOUGHT I HEARD SCREAMS. THIS FEELS LIKE A WOMAN WHO IS BEING ATTACKED. - A WOMAN BEING ATTACKED? - YEAH. OKAY. AND THAT'S THE SCREAMS YOU HEAR? YEAH. SO, WE'RE IN THE ROOM WHERE WILLIAM FAUST STAYED WHEN HE USED TO OCCUPY THIS HOTEL. FAUST KILLED A LITTLE GIRL WITH AN AXE, AND HE TRIED TO KILL HIS WIFE, TOO. I KIND OF WANT YOU TO KEEP TELLING ME WHAT YOU'RE FEELING. NOW, YOU HAVE ME REALLY INTRIGUED. FEELS LIKE A -- A BLONDE, IN, LIKE, A WHITE SORT OF NIGHTGOWN THING. - OKAY. - REALLY? THAT JUST GAVE ME CHILLS. LIKE, LAYING ON THE BED. I FEEL LIKE A DEFENSIVE SORT OF LIKE I AM TRYING TO STOP SOMETHING. - COME ON, MAN. - LIKE, ANOTHER... THAT **** IS CREEPY, BRO. THE POINTS THAT HE TOUCHED ON FROM HIS HAND MOVEMENTS TO HIM SAYING SOMEONE IS LOOKING OVER SOME -- A WOMAN IN A BED. DUDE, IT DEFINITELY MADE ME A BELIEVER IN PSYCHICS, OR AT LEAST PSYCHICS NAMED BRIAN. MAN, BRIAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAN, FOR COMING OUT. APPRECIATE THAT, MAN. SURE. NO. WELCOME BACK, FELLAS. - WHAT'S UP, BROTHER? - WELCOME BACK. HEY, MAN. I'M GOOD. WHAT'S UP, BLACK? IT'S **** HOT, BRO. WAIT, ARE YOU GONNA PUT YOUR **** SHIRT BACK ON?

I MEAN, WHERE'D Y'ALL GATHER? BRO, WE HAD A LOT OF ACTIVITY BETWEEN WILLIAM FAUST'S ROOM, ITZY'S ROOM, BRO, AND THE HOOKER'S ROOM. HEY, LISTEN, MAN. I AIN'T SCARED. I'LL GO UP IN THAT ROOM. MAN, I THINK YOU DEFINITELY SHOULD GO TO THE CHILD'S ROOM AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. LET'S GET IT POPPING. JUST PUT YOUR SHIRT BACK ON, PLAYBOY. THERE YOU GO. - ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO. Y'ALL JUST GON' WATCH ME GET DRESSED? JUST GON' WAIT. JUST GON' WAIT. 'CAUSE I'M NOT GOING IN THE HOUSE WITH YOU WITH YOUR SHIRT OFF. I'M JUST SAYING. THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST-FLOOR CHILDREN'S ROOM. YEAH. YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD CLAIMS OF TOYS BEING REARRANGED, BALLS MOVING. YOU KNOW, GETTING THE PRESENCE OF A YOUNG CHILD TOUCHING YOU, PLAYING WITH YOU, A REAL PLAYFUL SPIRIT. THIS IS WHAT WE GON' DO, BRO. LET'S SET SOME TRIGGER OBJECTS, MAN. AND LET'S TRY TO INTRODUCE SOME EVPs, BRO. LET ME SEE IT? ALL RIGHT. LET'S SIT DOWN, BRO. MAN. ARE YOU STILL HERE BECAUSE SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED TO YOU AT THE HOTEL? WOULD YOU LIKE FOR US TO PLAY WITH YOU? DO YOU LIKE CANDY? UM, IT'S TAKING IT TO A LITTLE "TO CATCH A PREDATOR." THAT WAS KIND OF PERV-ISH. YEAH. ARE YOU TRAPPED IN THIS HOUSE? LET'S RUN IT BACK, BRO, SEE IF WE CATCH ANYTHING. DO YOU PREFER TO BE CALLED A LADY OF THE NIGHT OR A WORKING GIRL? I'M-A BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU, AND YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE PISSED. I THINK I RECORDED OVER IT. YOU'RE AN IDIOT. THAT'S UP FOR DEBATE. THAT'S GOOD INVESTIGATING DOWN THE DRAIN. I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT... NAH, BRO. IT'S STILL HERE, MAN. WHAT IS THAT? YOU THINK MARCUS' BIG ASS FELL? **** **** MY GOD. I'M AT A LOSS FOR WORDS RIGHT NOW. DALEN, I NEED YOU TO COME HERE AND LOOK AT THIS, BRO. YOU HEARD THAT NOISE. - YEAH. - LOOK. **** SOMEBODY PUT MY MAN IN A FIGURE FOUR. I CAN FEEL, LIKE, THE HAIRS ON MY ARMS AND BACK OF MY NECK STAND UP. I'M NOT GONNA LIE, OUT OF ALL THE ROOMS I'VE BEEN IN IN THIS HOUSE, THIS ONE FEELS THE MOST... HEY, SHIV. WHAT'S UP, BABY? Hey, baby. What's going on? HEY, WHY YOU SO LOUD? I'M IN AN INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW. I'm sorry. Where are you at? I'M ACTUALLY IN A PROSTITUTE'S ROOM RIGHT NOW. BUT I'M-A HAVE TO HIT YOU BACK. - A prostitute room? HEY, LISTEN. I'M-A HIT YOU BACK. I'M -- I'LL BE BACK. LET ME JUST FINISH THIS REAL QUICK. You gon' need to call me back. Explanation, sir. Thank you. I FORGOT TO CLARIFY THE PROSTITUTES ARE DEAD, SO THAT'S... What? WELL, I MEAN, THEY'VE BEEN DEAD FOR A WHILE. I'M-A CALL YOU BACK. I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU. I'LL CALL YOU RIGHT BACK. No. WOMEN SURE DO KNOW WHEN YOU AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE SOMEWHERE, DON'T THEY? HOPEFULLY, SHE DON'T TRY TO KILL ME AND TURN ME INTO NO GHOST. WE HEARD THAT LOUD BANG, AND NOBODY WAS DOWN HERE IN THIS ROOM. THAT IS UNEXPLAINABLE. LOOK AT HIS LEGS. UM... IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING WALKED PAST. A DARK FIGURE SWIFTLY WALKED FROM THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM TO THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM. I JUST FEEL A CHILL, BRO. WE HEARD THAT LOUD BANG, AND NOBODY WAS DOWN HERE IN THIS ROOM. THAT IS UNEXPLAINABLE. LOOK AT HIS LEGS. IT LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING WALKED PAST IN THE ROOM, BRO. IN WHICH ROOM? THIS ROOM RIGHT... IT LITERALLY LOOKED LIKE A DARK FIGURE SWIFTLY WALKED FROM THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM TO THIS SIDE OF THE ROOM, BRO. WHERE? IT CAME FROM HERE, AND IT WALKED PAST THE DOOR RIGHT HERE JUST LIKE THIS AND STOPPED. I JUST FEEL A CHILL, BRO. WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S OVER HERE. THEY SAY IF YOU ACTUALLY SIT ON THAT LEDGE, YOUR BOOTY WILL VIBRATE. THEY SAY YOU MAKE THIS WINDOWSILL RATTLE. I WILL NOT BE AFRAID. FEEL FREE TO DO SO AND LET YOUR PRESENCE BE KNOWN. DUDE, I SWEAR TO GOD -- I SWEAR TO GOD, HOMIE. WHAT WAS THAT NOISE? DUDE, I SWEAR TO GOD. I SWEAR, AS SOON AS I ASKED THAT QUESTION, BRO, I FELT SOMETHING PUT ITS FOOT IN BETWEEN MY TWO FEET, AND IT MADE A SOUND LIKE A... WELL, IT WASN'T... YO, HERE. WE GOT ALL THAT... LET YOUR PRESENCE BE KNOWN. BRO, ALL RIGHT. I'M GOOD. I'M GOOD, HOMIE. THAT IS CRAZY. YO. IT STEPPED IN BETWEEN MY FOOT, AND I HEARD IT. AND THAT IS ME BEING 1,000% REAL, BRO. I PLAY AROUND A LOT. I JOKE AROUND A LOT. I SHUCK AND JIVE, BUT HAND TO THE SKY, SOMETHING LITERALLY... I'LL PUT MY RIGHT HAND TO THE SKY. SOMETHING LITERALLY JUST TOOK A STEP IN BETWEEN MY LEGS, BRO. YOU CAUGHT THE SOUND ON YOUR PHONE. I'M NOT -- I'M NOT -- I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING IN THAT ROOM ANYMORE. - MAN. I DON'T. I DON'T THINK I RATTLE TOO EASILY, BUT THIS HOTEL IS PULLING MY CHAIN. I'M SHAKY. I'M ANXIOUS, AND TO BE HONEST, I'M A LITTLE SCARED. WE NEED TO LET MARCUS KNOW WHAT WENT DOWN AND WRAP UP THIS INVESTIGATION SO WE CAN GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. I SAW A DARK FIGURE THAT CROSSED IN THE SMOKE ROOM, AND I SAT DOWN ON THE WINDOWSILL. AND I FELT A PRESENCE STEP IN BETWEEN MY LEGS, AND I HEARD THE FOOTSTEP. DUDE, I SWEAR TO GOD. I SWEAR TO GOD, HOMIE. WAS YOU SCARED THEN? DAMN NEAR **** MYSELF. I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN SOME GREAT ENERGY IN THIS PLACE. I MEAN, FROM WHEN ME AND YOU WERE IN THE BASEMENT, WE HEARD THE FOOTSTEPS UP HERE. YEAH. WHAT IS THAT? - YO, BRUH. SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY'S WALKING UPSTAIRS. SHH. SHH. SHH. - YOU HEAR THAT? - YEAH. THERE'S SOMEBODY ON THE FLOOR RIGHT ABOVE US. AND THEN THE PINK BATHROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR, ME AND MARK... - MARK, YEAH. WE HAD SOMEBODY PULL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BATHROOM DOOR. AND IT'S WEIRD BECAUSE WE WOULD CAPTURE EVP... WHAT IN THE... - COME ON, MAN. WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR? NOBODY. DIDN'T YOU HAVE A, UM, EXHALE? YEAH. I DEFINITELY CAUGHT AN EXHALE UPSTAIRS ON THE SECOND FLOOR. ARE YOU TAKING ON NEW CLIENTELE? I HAVE $15 CASH... DO YOU HEAR THAT? I SAW ABE. HE HAD BEEN DISCOMBOBULATED. FOUND HIM ON THE FLOOR. MY GOD. I'M AT A LOSS FOR WORDS RIGHT NOW. IT'S LIKE THIS WHOLE HOUSE IS A HOT SPOT FOR ACTIVITY, MAN. I FEEL LIKE IT KEEPS THE SPIRITS LOCKED IN. I'M NOT GONNA SAY THE HOUSE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED. BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S DEFINITELY, LIKE... - A SAFE HAVEN. - ...A SAFE HAVEN FOR IT. - YEAH, MAN. - LIKE IT'S A HOTEL FOR GHOSTS. - LITERALLY. - LIKE, CATS CHECK IN, BUT THEY DON'T CHECK OUT. BUT I TELL YOU ONE THING... ...I'M GON' CHECK OUT. - FOR SURE. - WE'RE DEFINITELY CHECKING OUT. WE CAME HERE TONIGHT TO PROVE THAT THE TRAGIC EVENTS FROM THE MAGNOLIA HOTEL'S PAST WERE CAUSING SPIRITS TO LINGER HERE. HEY, PEACE OUT, HOUSE. AFTER WE EXPERIENCED PARANORMAL ACTIVITY IN ALMOST EVERY ROOM, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THIS HOTEL IS DEFINITELY HAUNTED. CERTIFIED. LISTEN, GREAT GHOSTING. BRUH. - THAT WAS IT. IT'S TIME TO GO. BRO, I'M OUTIE. HEY, MARCUS. DON'T BE TRYING TO LEAVE US. I'M JUST SAYING, YOU BETTER GET IN THE CAR FAST. I'M OUTIE LIKE A NAVEL. GOOD DAY. GOOD NIGHT. ♪ GHOST BROTHERS GHOSTING OUT ♪
