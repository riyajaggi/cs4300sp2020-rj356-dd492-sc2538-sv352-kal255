 ANY SPIRITUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES. I'M JUWAN, AND I'M A GHOST BROTHER. Marcus: THIS IS THE OLD RULE -- ONE BLACK PERSON SCURRY, ALL OF THEM SCURRY. MY NAME IS MARCUS, AND I'M A GHOST BROTHER. - [ LOUD BANG ] - WHAT THE F-- Dalen: OUR MISSION IS TO HIT THE MOST HAUNTED LOCATIONS IN AMERICA TO PROVE THAT GHOSTS ARE FOR REAL. - ♪ GHOST BROTHERS IN THE PLACE ♪ - AAH! - ♪ WHERE NO OTHER CREW ♪ - [ SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY ] - ♪ CAN FACE THE FEAR ♪ - WOW. ♪ MAN, WE IN HERE ♪ All: THE GHOST BROTHERS. Juwan: WHAT'S GOING ON, BLACK MAN? - Marcus: GETTING HIM FRESH. - I SEE YOU'RE IN THE PLACE TO BE. WHAT'S GOOD, MY MAN? YOU ALL RIGHT? GOOD DAY, GUYS. WHAT WE GOT TODAY? WHAT WE GOT TODAY? SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. - THE BAY? - THE BAY. THE WINCHESTER MYSTERY HOUSE. WINCHESTER? LIKE THE GUN? EXACTLY LIKE THE GUN. THE WINCHESTER MYSTERY HOUSE WAS BUILT BY SARAH WINCHESTER, AN HEIR TO THE WINCHESTER RIFLE FORTUNE. SHE BELIEVED SHE WAS HAUNTED BY THE GHOSTS OF THOSE KILLED BY THE RIFLE AND CONSTRUCTED HER HOUSE LIKE A MAZE TO CONFUSE THE GHOSTS. SO SHE CAN KIND OF HIDE IN HER OWN HOUSE. 'CAUSE SOMETIMES THE GHOST AIN'T WATCHING WHEN YOU GO INTO THE OTHER ROOM. THEY NOT WATCHING THE CONSTRUCTION. THEY AIN'T GOT THE FLOOR PLAN. I GOT YOU. "WHAT? HOW DID SHE GET TO THERE?" YEAH, OKAY. THE ECCENTRIC HOME FEATURES 160 ROOMS, 40 BEDROOMS, SEEMINGLY ENDLESS HALLWAYS AND SEVERAL MYSTERIOUS DEAD ENDS. SARAH BEGAN CONSTRUCTION IN 1884, AND CONTINUED DAY AND NIGHT UNTIL HER DEATH 38 YEARS LATER. - SHE MUST'VE HAD BREAD, THOUGH. - OH. BRO, SHE WAS THE HEIR TO THE WINCHESTER. - OH, YEAH. SO, SHE'S... - SHE'S CAKED UP. - [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] - SHE INHERITED ALL THIS MONEY, BUT SHE ALSO INHERITED ALL THESE GHOSTS. WITNESSES REPORT SEEING APPARITIONS, OBJECTS THAT INEXPLICABLY MOVE, AND HEARING STRANGE VOICES AND NOISES. IT'S OUR JOB TO FIGURE OUT IF SARAH WINCHESTER WAS RIGHT. ARE THE SPIRITS PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED BY THE RIFLES? ARE THE SPIRITS SARAH'S WORKERS, OR SARAH HERSELF? THIS IS LIKE A PUZZLE PERPLEX SITUATION, GUYS. - OKAY. - BUT THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT WHICH "P" IT'S GONNA BE.. [ LAUGHTER ] IS TO GET ON OUT TO SAN JOSE, FELLAS. ♪♪ SO, FELLAS, I GOT AN AWESOME ACTIVITY FOR US, MAN. 'CAUSE THINK ABOUT IT, IF WE'RE GONNA BE DEALING WITH THE WINCHESTER FAMILY... - UH-HUH. ...WHY NOT GET OUR HANDS ON WHAT MADE THEM SO GREAT? - WORD. LIKE, PISTOL-TOTIN'? - YES, MAN. I'M GONNA TAKE Y'ALL OUT TO THE GUN RANGE, MAN. [ LAUGHS ] LOOK, MAN. THERE IT IS. OH, IT'S MORE THAN JUST A RANCH. - OH, MAN. - IT'S NICE. Marcus: LIKE A REAL COWBOY SITUATION. ♪♪ WELCOME TO LITTLE CREEK, GUYS. ALL RIGHT. HOW YOU DOING? I'M JUWAN. - LEFTY? - MARCUS. SO YOU GUYS WANT TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WINCHESTER? YEAH. WE WOULD LOVE TO LEARN. WELL, LET'S GO OVER AND TAKE A LOOK THEN. WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS A SET OF THE GUNS THAT WINCHESTER MADE FROM 1866 - OKAY. - ...TO 1897. Dalen: WINCHESTER WAS THE MOST POPULAR GUNMAKER OF THE LATE 1800s. WITH THEIR ABILITY TO FIRE MULTIPLE SHOTS WITHOUT RELOADING, THESE GUNS BECAME A MUST-HAVE FOR FRONTIERSMEN, SO MUCH SO THAT THE INFAMOUS KILLERS BILLY THE KIDD AND JESSE JAMES BOTH USED WINCHESTERS, AS WELL AS GERONIMO AND HIS BAND OF INDIANS. THE LEVER ACTION 1832 MODEL WAS SO SIGNIFICANT THAT IT BECAME KNOWN AS THE GUN THAT WON THE WEST. ♪♪ NOW YOU'RE RELOADING. YOU'VE GOT BAD GUYS COMING. GOD! UH-OH. [ BELL CLANGS ] - MAN, THIS IS AMAZING. LIKE, TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT A WINCHESTER RIFLE. I'VE NEVER HANDLED, LIKE, A RIFLE LIKE THAT BEFORE, SO THAT'S DOPE. - ALL RIGHT, GUYS. - ALL RIGHT. - I APPRECIATE Y'ALL. THANK YOU. - TO THE WINCHESTER MANSION! Dalen: YOU KNOW, IT'S FUN TO PLAY GUNSLINGER, BUT WE CAN'T FORGET THAT THESE WEAPONS HAD A BLOODY HISTORY. THIS LEGACY HAUNTED SARAH WINCHESTER. SHE TRIED TO ESCAPE IT WITHIN THE WALLS OF HER HOME, BUT STILL, THE VICTIMS WOULD HAUNT HER TILL HER DYING DAY. SAY, THIS HOUSE KINDA NICE IN A... IN A WHAT KINDA WAY? - ECLECTIC. ECCENTRIC. - YEAH. IT'S VERY ECCENTRIC. LOOK AT THAT -- "DOOR TO NOWHERE." - LITERALLY. - SO WHERE IS THE FRONT? - I DON'T KNOW. - IS THIS THE FRONT THAT WE'RE... Juwan: YOU HAVE A MAZE OF A HOUSE, BUT YOU HAVE A REGULAR FRONT DOOR? - OKAY, COOL. - YOU HAVE A REGULAR FRONT DOOR. Dalen: I MEAN, IF THIS HOUSE TRULY LIVES UP TO ITS BILLING, IT'S PROBABLY GONNA BE DIFFICULT AS HELL TO NAVIGATE THROUGH IT. SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY WAIT ON A TOUR GUIDE. BUT THEN AGAIN, WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT? - TRY THAT DOOR. - THESE LITTLE BABY STEPS. LOOK AT THE LITTLE BABY STEPS. [ LAUGHS ] HOW DO YOU JUST DECIDE TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE HALLWAY? - OH, I FOUND THE BATHROOM. - SHOOT. WHERE? - RIGHT HERE. - OKAY. MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE SOME CRUMBS DOWN. THIS THE THIRD FLOOR? BRO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT FLOOR WE ON. I THINK THIS IS THE THIRD FLOOR. Dalen: FOR SARAH TO BUILD SUCH AN ELABORATE MAZE OF A HOUSE, LIKE, SHE HAD TO HAVE THE BLUEPRINT IN HER MIND. THAT MIGHT BE THE SMARTEST THING IF YOU WAS RUNNING FROM SOMETHING, AND YOU ONLY KNOW THE DIRECTION IN AND OUT. - Juwan: ALL RIGHT. - IT'S KIND OF CONFUSING. - SHOULD WE JUST CALL SOMEBODY? - SIRI? CALL AN UBER OR SOMETHING. [ LAUGHS ] MAPQUEST THIS THING, BRO. Juwan: SERIOUSLY, THIS PLACE IS HARD TO NAVIGATE, SO I'M GLAD WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO FIND JANAN, OUR TOUR GUIDE. HOW ARE YOU? I'M JANAN. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. - HEY, JANAN. - I'M JUWAN. HEY, JUWAN. IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU. Dalen: JANAN IS A TOUR GUIDE AT THE HOUSE, AND SHE KNOWS ALL ABOUT THE HISTORY. THE HOUSE WAS BUILT BY SARAH LOCKWOOD PARDEE, WHO WAS THE HEIRESS TO THE WINCHESTER RIFLE FORTUNE. - OOH. - AND SHE MOVED OUT HERE IN THE MID-1880s AFTER HER HUSBAND'S DEATH AND BUILT A HOUSE. - DID THEY HAVE CHILDREN? THEY HAD A DAUGHTER NAMED ANNIE, BUT SADLY, SHE DIED WHEN SHE WAS ABOUT 6 WEEKS OLD. - SO WHAT MADE HER MOVE OUT HERE? - THERE'S A LOT OF THEORIES. Dalen: IT IS BELIEVED THAT SARAH WENT TO A PSYCHIC WHO TOLD HER THAT THE UNTIMELY DEATHS OF HER HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER WERE CAUSED BY VENGEFUL SPIRITS. [ GUNSHOT ] THE PSYCHIC WARNED SARAH THAT THE ONLY WAY TO AVOID BEING THEIR NEXT VICTIM WAS TO MOVE OUT WEST FROM CONNECTICUT AND BEGIN BUILDING A HOUSE THAT WOULD CONFUSE THE GHOSTS. SO HER -- HER MOTIVATION FOR CONTINUOUSLY REMODELING THE HOUSE WAS BECAUSE THE MEDIUM TOLD HER THAT, LIKE, "YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE..." THAT'S THE LEGEND. THAT MEDIUM WAS PLAYING A PRANK ON HER. - THAT'S A HUGE PRANK. - THAT'S TERRIBLE. LIKE, "GUESS WHAT I TOLD THIS GIRL TO DO, AND SHE BELIEVED ME!" - "SHE DID IT!" - [ LAUGHING ] - DANG! SHE GOT OUT HERE AND DID ALL THIS RIGHT OUT? YEP. SO HOW WAS SHE BEING CREATIVE WITH, LIKE, WHAT TO BUILD? ANOTHER LEGEND -- UH, HER SéANCE ROOM. Dalen: EVERY NIGHT AT MIDNIGHT, THE BELLS IN THE TOWER WOULD RING IN ORDER TO SUMMON THE SPIRITS, AND SARAH WOULD BEGIN HER SéANCE. ACCORDING TO LEGEND, THIS IS HOW SARAH OBTAINED MOST OF HER CONSTRUCTION PLANS, WHICH WERE PASSED ON TO HER DEVOTED STAFF, WHO WERE PART OF HER INNER CIRCLE. OH, SO THE GHOSTS WERE HER CONTRACTORS? - YEAH. -RIGHT. - Janan: THAT'S THE STORY. "OOH, I CAN'T WAIT TILL I GET THIS DOUBLE VANITY." [ LAUGHTER ] - OOH! WALK-IN CLOSET. YEAH. YEAH. [ LAUGHS ] [ Spooky voice ] WALK-IN CLOSETS ON BOTH SIDES. SO WHO DO THEY BELIEVE IS HAUNTING THIS PLACE? I LIKE TO THINK IT'S HER SERVANTS. I THINK THAT THEY LIKED IT HERE AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE. COULD THERE BE ANY TRUTH TO WHAT THE MEDIUM SAID, THAT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED AT THE HAND OF THE WINCHESTER GUNS COULD BE HERE, OR FOLLOWING HER? YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS MINE. DO PEOPLE STILL REPORT STUFF HAPPENING? FOOTSTEPS. SOME PEOPLE CLAIM THEY'VE SEEN SHADOWS. Dalen: THERE'S BEEN ACTIVITY REPORTED IN MANY PARTS OF THE HOUSE. HERE IN THE VENETIAN DINING ROOM, THE CHANDELIER OFTEN SWINGS ALL ON ITS OWN. THERE ARE CLAIMS ON THE SECOND FLOOR AS WELL, ESPECIALLY SARAH'S BEDROOM, WHERE MRS. WINCHESTER DIED IN 1922. THERE HAVE BEEN CLAIMS OF A POLTERGEIST, WHICH IS AN ENTITY KNOWN TO MOVE OBJECTS. IN ANNIE'S BEDROOM, PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED CABINETS AND DOORS SLAMMING. PEOPLE EXPERIENCE WEIRD THINGS IN HERE. THERE'S SOME KIND OF WEIRD ENERGY. TO ME, IT FEELS LIKE THIS HOUSE IS OVERFLOWING WITH, LIKE, WEIRD ENERGY AND WEIRD EXPERIENCES... Marcus: HEY, KAYLA, HOW YOU DOING? Dalen: ...KIND OF LIKE THOSE OF OUR GUEST INVESTIGATOR, KAYLA. SO TELL US WHERE WE'RE AT. WE ARE AT THE UNFINISHED WING OF THE WINCHESTER HOUSE. Juwan: HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU IN THIS PART OF THE HOUSE? NO, ACTUALLY. NO INVESTIGATORS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN HERE YET. OOH. SO ANOTHER FIRST FOR THE GHOST BROS. - BREAK IT IN. POW! - THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. TELL US ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE. I'VE HAD MY EXPERIENCE IN THE BASEMENT. AS SOON AS I WALKED IN AND THE DOOR CLOSED, I FELT THIS COLD BREATH DOWN MY NECK AND A VOICE IN MY EAR SAYING, "KAYLA, WHAT SUCH A PRETTY NAME." WHAT? WHAT? IT WAS THE VOICE OF A WOMAN? MALE? WOMAN. I DO BELIEVE IT WAS SARAH WINCHESTER. OH. OKAY. SO YOU SEEM, LIKE, VERY IN TUNE. YEAH. LIKE, A HUMAN TRIGGER OBJECT, I'VE BEEN CALLED. WE LIKE TO USE HUMAN TRIGGER OBJECTS. I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO COME OUT TONIGHT AND MAYBE ACCOMPANY US ON PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. I'M DOWN. Dalen: SINCE KAYLA HAS ALREADY HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH WHO SHE THOUGHT WAS SARAH WINCHESTER, MAYBE USING HER CAN UP OUR CHANCES OF FINDING SOMETHING. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS TIME TO DO? WHAT'S THAT? - POP THE TRUNK ON THESE GHOSTS. [ ALARM CHIRPS ] THAT MOMENT. YOU GOTTA JUST DUCK THAT. YOU SEE HOW I DUCK THAT? THAT'S ATHLETICISM. MAN, I GOT THE TRUSTY OLD REM-POD. WE GOT OUR THERMAL CAM. WE ALSO HAVE OUR OVILUS. WE KNOW WE WANNA TALK TO SARAH... OKAY. SURE. ...SEE IF SHE'LL GIVE US SOME WORDS. WE GOT A LASER GRID. SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET THIS THING POPPING AND MOVING, BRO. OUR MISSION FOR TONIGHT IS TO FIND OUT WHAT SPIRITS ARE ACTUALLY HAUNTING THIS HOUSE. IS IT THE VICTIMS OF THE WINCHESTER RIFLE OR MAYBE THE WORKERS? OR IT COULD EVEN BE SARAH HERSELF. IT'S TIME FOR US TO SADDLE UP AND GET TO STRAIGHT GHOSTING. SINCE NO ONE HAS EVER EXPLORED THE UNFINISHED WING, THAT'S WHERE MARCUS AND JUWAN ARE GONNA GO. BUT ME AND KAYLA, WE GONNA HEAD DOWN TO THE BASEMENT. AND IF YOU THINK THE TOP OF THE HOUSE IS WEIRD AND CRAZY AND WINDY, THIS BASEMENT IS EVEN WORSE. Dalen: SO THIS IS WHERE KAYLA CLAIMED TO HAVE HEARD THE VOICE OF SARAH WINCHESTER. [ WHISTLES ] ARE YOU CALLING THE GHOST WITH A WHISTLE? - THEY'RE NOT DOGS. - NO. THAT AIN'T TO CALL ON THEM. THAT'S LETTING YOU KNOW I'M COMING AROUND THIS CORNER. SO HERE IN THE BASEMENT, WE'VE HAD... [ Whispers ] STOP, STOP. [ FOOTSTEPS, RUSTLING ] [ Whispers ] IS THAT A STEP? GO, GO, GO. SOMETHING COMING FROM THIS WAY, RIGHT? HELLO? ARE THERE ANY WORKERS DOWN HERE? SOMETHING'S WALKING, AND -- DO YOU HAVE A LIGHT? IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE BOOTS. ARE YOU SOMEONE THAT WAS KILLED BY A WINCHESTER RIFLE? AND THERE IS NO ONE IN HERE. [ LOUD BANGING ] WHAT? WHAT?! ♪♪ [ LOUD BANGING ] WHAT? WHAT?! WHICH WAY WAS THAT? I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS THAT WAY OR THIS WAY. NO, THE DOOR, THE DOOR THAT WE GO IN. CAME THROUGH. - Kayla: OH! - IS IT CLOSED? IT... N-NO WAY. IT DIDN'T LOCK. - NOW TRY IT. PUSH IT OPEN. [ DOOR THUDS ] THEY DIDN'T LOCK IT, BUT THEY... THEY CLOSED ON US. Dalen: SO ME AND KAYLA, WE'RE IN THE BASEMENT WHEN A DOOR SLAMS SHUT ON US. [ LOUD BANGING ] WHAT? WHAT?! NOBODY ELSE WAS WITH US. I MEAN, THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. SO WE'RE GONNA BRING OUT THE OVILUS AND SEE IF ANYONE WANTS TO SPEAK -- REACH OUT. ALL RIGHT, GUYS, WHOEVER'S IN HERE, YOU HAVE ME, DALEN. - AND YOU HAVE ME, KAYLA. - KAYLA. FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO US, SPEAK TO US. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO SAY TO US? WHY DID YOU SLAM THE DOOR? ARE YOU UPSET? ARE YOU TRYING TO LOCK US IN HERE? Automated female voice: POLTERGEIST. - POLTERGEIST. - POLTERGEIST. OH, ****. - OH. - KAYLA, YOU DID THIS. HOW DID I DO IT? THE DOOR SLAMMED SHUT, CLOSING US INTO THE BASEMENT. AND WE PULLED OUT THE OVILUS, AND THE FIRST WORD THAT COMES UP IS "POLTERGEIST." THE WORD POLTERGEIST POPPING UP ON THE OVILUS IS CRAZY TO ME. I MEAN, WE ALREADY HAD CLAIMS FROM TOUR GUIDES THAT SAID THEY HAD EXPERIENCES WITH POLTERGEISTS UP IN SARAH WINCHESTER'S ROOM. THIS WOULD MOST LIKELY BE A GHOST WITH POLTERGEIST-LIKE CAPABILITIES OF BEING ABLE TO CLOSE DOORS. [ LOUD BANGING ] WHAT? WHAT?! AND YOU HAVE TO BE REALLY STRONG JUST TO GET THIS DOOR OPENED OR CLOSED. ESSENTIALLY, SOMETHING A... POLTERGEIST WOULD DO. OVER THEIR YEARS OF BEING A GHOST, YOU PROBABLY LEARN HOW TO DO STUFF. BECAUSE YOU GOT A LOT OF TIME TO PRACTICE. YEP. [ GASPS ] OH, ****! WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH YOU, KAYLA? WHAT ARE YOU JUMPING AT? I SAW A SHADOW, BUT I THINK IT WAS JUST MY OWN. OH, YOU'RE TRIPPIN'. - BUT I THINK I HAVE AN IDEA. - WHAT'S THAT? YOU KNOW HOW YOU WANT TO CONTACT SARAH WINCHESTER? YEAH. YEAH, YEAH. WHAT IF I BECOME A TRIGGER OBJECT? - AND DO WHAT? - DRESS LIKE SARAH WINCHESTER. HEY, MAN, I'M WITH IT IF YOU'RE WITH IT. ALL RIGHT. LET'S DO IT. ♪♪ Marcus: OKAY, I THINK THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO STOP, 'CAUSE THE REST OF THE FLOOR IS NOT DONE. SO RIGHT NOW, WE'RE ON THE TOP LEVEL OF THE THIRD FLOOR. THEY SAY THIS IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY. [ STATIC CRACKLES ] - Dalen: Yo. - HELLO. BRO, Y'ALL ARE NOT GONNA BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME AND KAYLA. We break out the Ovilus, And the first word that comes out is "poltergeist." - Marcus: AH, HECK NO, MAN. - YOU'RE LYING. YOU'RE LYING, BRO. YOU ARE LYING. Y'ALL PLAY TOO MANY GAMES, MAN. BRO, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED, BRO. Juwan: BUT WHY "POLTERGEIST," THOUGH? BECAUSE, LIKE, THAT'S ONE OF THE CLAIMS. Juwan: Kayla, did you bring this on? Dalen: That's what I told her. I said she did this. Marcus: SHE KNOW WHAT SHE DOIN'. - HEY, MARCUS. - YEAH? LET'S SIT DOWN AND SEE IF WE CAN CONTACT ANYTHING UP HERE. PERFECT. HAVE MY BACK TO THE WALL, MAN, SO I CAN SEE WHAT'S COMING. SO IS THERE ANYONE UP HERE WITH US? [ BEEPING ] SOMEBODY'S UP HERE WITH US. [ CHUCKLES ] ARE YOU A WORKER? OKAY. SO, LIKE, DID YOU WORK HERE AS SOMEONE WHO WAS A SERVANT? MAYBE IT'S JUST, LIKE, THE WORKERS AND THE SERVANTS JUST DIDN'T LEAVE. [ BEEPING ] Dalen: WE'RE UP HERE IN SARAH WINCHESTER'S BEDROOM. THIS IS THE ROOM WHERE SHE PASSED AWAY. THIS ROOM HAS CLAIMS OF POLTERGEIST ACTIVITY. I MEAN, LIKE, DOORS SLAMMING, WHICH IS THE EXACT SAME THING WE JUST EXPERIENCED IN THE BASEMENT. - THIS IS THE ROOM... - Kayla: DALEN? WHAT'S GOING ON? - WHOA! - HMM? WHOA. KAYLA HERE HAS DECIDED TO TAKE IT UP A NOTCH. SHE'S DRESSED UP AS SARAH, AND WE'RE GONNA SET UP A REM-POD AND SEE IF WE CAN GET ANY TYPE OF RESPONSE GOING. OKAY. SARAH? MY NAME IS KAYLA. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT, YES, I AM DRESSED LIKE YOU... [ BEEPING ] ...BUT IN NO FORM OF DISRESPECT. ALL RIGHT. SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE VISUAL PROVOKING IS WORKING. I ADMIRE YOU. I WISH... LET'S STEP AWAY FROM THE REM-POD 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT EVEN CLOSE TO IT, BUT IT'S GOING BANANAS RIGHT NOW. ARE YOU UPSET AT KAYLA DRESSING LIKE YOU? [ BEEPING ] OKAY. WAS THAT A SIGN THAT YOU DON'T WANT ME COMING ANY CLOSER? IT GOES OFF AS SOON AS YOU GET CLOSE. - OKAY, LOOK. - WHY DON'T YOU STEP ON THE FLOOR? I'M STEPPING BACK. [ BEEPING STOPS ] - [ DALEN CHUCKLES ] - OKAY. [ BEEPING RESUMES ] IF I WEREN'T DRESSED LIKE SARAH WINCHESTER, WOULD YOU ALLOW ME TO GO PAST THIS? Dalen: OBVIOUSLY, THAT OFFENDS YOU. WE WANT YOU TO FEEL COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO BE IN HERE WITH US. OKAY. I AM NO LONGER DRESSED AS YOU. [ BEEPS ] IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT YOU. OKAY. STEP BACK. STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT. LET ME SEE. LET ME PUT THIS CAMERA DOWN. LET ME STEP CLOSER AND SEE IF IT GOES OFF AS MUCH AS IT DOES WITH JUST YOU. I'M WAY CLOSER THAN YOU WERE, AND IT'S NOT GOING OFF IN THE WAY THAT IT WENT OFF WHEN YOU GOT THAT CLOSE. SO LET'S... I DON'T KNOW. LET'S TRY AGAIN. - IF YOU... - OKAY. I'M WALKING CLOSE, BUT REMEMBER, I'M NOT DRESSED LIKE YOU ANYMORE. LOOK. LOOK. WHY DOES IT GO CRAZY FOR YOU? AM I DISRESPECTING YOU IN SOME WAY? - IF SO... - YES. YES. YES. ...THAT IS NOT MY INTENTION. [ BEEPING ] OH! OH! WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? SARAH? MAN, YOU MIGHT WANT TO QUIT PLAYING WITH HER, KAYLA. - LIKE, SHE TELLING YOU, BACK -- - [ GASPS ] OOH! WHAT THE -- ♪♪ AM I DISRESPECTING YOU IN SOME WAY? [ BEEPING ] KAYLA AND I ARE ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE WINCHESTER HOUSE, TRYING TO CONNECT WITH THE SPIRIT OF SARAH WINCHESTER. [ BEEPING CONTINUES ] - SARAH? MAN, YOU MIGHT WANT TO QUIT PLAYING WITH HER, KAYLA. - LIKE, SHE TELLING YOU, BACK -- - [ GASPS ] OH! WHAT THE FUDGE?! - I SAW THAT! - WHAT DID YOU SEE? I... SOMETHING HIT THE FL-- [ BEEPING ] THE REM-POD IS GOING BANANAS. IT -- SOMETHING HIT THE FLOOR RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE, OVER THERE. WHERE I WAS AT. RIGHT IN FRONT OF WHERE YOU WERE, SOMETHING HIT THE FLOOR. WHATEVER'S IN HERE DOES NOT LIKE YOU PLAYING AROUND AS SARAH, WITH SARAH. - OKAY. - MAYBE SHE DOESN'T WANT ANOTHER WOMAN IN HER BEDROOM. I GET THAT. I UNDERSTAND, AND I WILL LEAVE. - IS THAT WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE? [ BEEPING ] - Dalen: YES. - OKAY. OKAY. DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE, TOO? OR AM I COOL? ALL RIGHT. WE GET IT. WE GET IT, 'CAUSE THIS IS YOUR PERSONAL SPACE. - YEAH. - I UNDERSTAND. I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE IN MY ROOM. I'M SORRY, SARAH. Yo, are y'all in that unfinished wing? YES, SIR. ALL RIGHT. BET, BRO. ME AND KAYLA FIXING TO MEET Y'ALL UP THERE REAL QUICK. Juwan: COPY THAT. - [ SIGHS DEEPLY ] LET'S DO IT. - ALL RIGHT. Dalen: NAVIGATING THROUGH THIS HOUSE CAN BE CONFUSING AND VERY DIFFICULT. SARAH BUILT IT THAT WAY TO CONFUSE THE SPIRITS. I MEAN, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF ROOMS, ENDLESS PASSAGEWAYS, AND STAIRCASES THAT GO TO NOWHERE. SO NEVER MIND THE GHOSTS. I'M WORRIED THAT THE HOUSE MIGHT TAKE US TO DOWN. YO. WHERE Y'ALL AT? - Marcus: IN THE BACK-BACK. - Dalen: HUH? WATCH YOUR STEP, THOUGH. BRO. LOOK AT KAYLA, GUYS. LOOK AT THE OUTFIT SHE HAS ON. - OH, WOW. - Kayla: MM-HMM. NO KIDDING. YOU WENT -- YOU WENT FULL-OUT. - YOU WENT FULL-OUT. - OKAY. - YEAH, AND THEY DON'T LIKE IT. - THAT YOU WENT FULL-OUT? THAT'S WHAT IT WAS DOING ALL UPSTAIRS IN SARAH'S BEDROOM WHERE SHE DIED. IT WOULDN'T STOP. Dalen: BRO, Y'ALL DON'T UNDERSTAND. WE WERE IN MRS. WINCHESTER'S BEDROOM. - YEAH. - WHERE SHE PASSED AWAY, YOU KNOW. BRO, KAYLA STARTS WALKING THROUGH THE ROOM. THE REM-POD STARTS. I'VE NEVER IN MY LIFE SEEN A REM-POD GO THAT HARD, BRO. IT WAS GOING BANANAS. SCREAMING LIKE, "GET OUT!" - LIKE, CRAZY. - WOW. YEAH, AND THEN SOMETHING DROPPED ON THE FLOOR THAT SOUNDED LIKE A WEIGHT. AND YOU JUST HEAR ME SAY, "WHAT THE FUDGE?" AND YOU KNOW, WHEN WHITE PEOPLE SAY "WHAT THE FUDGE?"... THAT'S LIKE, "ON EVERYTHING I LOVE." THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT TO, "ON EVERYTHING I LOVE." THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF, "WHAT THE FUDGE?" - RIGHT. - [ Nasal voice ] "LITERALLY, THAT IS EVERYTHING THAT I LOVE, FROM MY MOTHER TO MY..." - TO MY ASSETS. - ... "MY PORTFOLIO"... - SO... YEP? WHAT WAS Y'ALL DOING IN HERE? IT LOOKS LIKE Y'ALL WERE TAKING A BREAK, TO BE HONEST. NO. YOU KNOW WHAT? THE IDEA WAS TO LOOK LIKE WE WERE TAKING A BREAK BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE WERE TRYING TO CONTACT THE WORKERS AND SERVANTS. WE THINK THAT THAT KIND OF... MADE THEM FEEL COMFORTABLE. YOU'VE GOT TO GET DOWN ON THEIR LEVEL, YOU KNOW? Y'ALL CAN RELAX 'CAUSE WE GONNA RELAX. - MAKES SENSE. - SEE? IT JUST SEEMS LIKE Y'ALL JUST TRYING TO JUSTIFY Y'ALL JUST TAKING A BREAK, TO ME. [ MARCUS SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] [ LOUD BANG ] - Kayla: WHAT THE... HOLD UP. IT'S, LIKE, SOMETHING, LIKE, DROPPED. I GOT YOU, MARCUS, ON CAMERA, BRO. WAS THAT SIMILAR TO THE SOUND THAT YOU GUYS HEARD OVER HERE? - Dalen: YEAH. - YES. [ LOUD CLATTER ] Juwan: I HEARD THAT SOUND. I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM. IS SOMETHING OVER HERE? - FELLAS... - YO. - WHAT Y'ALL FIND? - NOTHING. MARCUS IS STILL TRYING TO EXPLORE WHERE HE THOUGHT HE HEARD THE SOUND COME FROM. Dalen: I'M GOING TO CUT ON THIS OVILUS TO SEE IF ANYONE WANTS TO JUST THROW SOME WORDS OUT. OKAY. LET'S FIRE UP THAT REM-POD. [ BEEPING ] JUST ME DOING THE BASELINE. - OKAY, GOOD. - YEAH. SO LET'S STEP BACK FOR A MINUTE. YEAH, I THOUGHT IT WAS PISSED AGAIN. IS THERE ANYBODY HERE WHO WOULD LIKE TO TALK WITH US? [ BEEPING ] -OH. OKAY. -OKAY. Juwan: THEY READY. DID YOU USED TO WORK HERE? Dalen: YES. ARE YOU A FAMILY MEMBER? ARE YOU THE POLTERGEIST FROM THE BASEMENT? IS THIS A SPIRIT FROM ANYBODY THAT DIED FROM A WINCHESTER RIFLE? DO Y'ALL LIKE KAYLA'S OUTFIT? - REALLY? - HEY. HEY. - IT LOOKS GOOD, KAYLA. SERIOUSLY. - THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. Dalen: MAN, I'M JUST SAYING, MAYBE YOUR SARAH OUTFIT IS MAKING THE GHOST UNCOMFORTABLE. REMEMBER WHAT I DID LAST TIME WHEN I WAS IN THERE? I CHANGED. LET'S TRY IT AGAIN. - WHAT? - BRO. THIS WORKED IN SARAH'S BEDROOM. SHE GONNA TAKE OFF THE VEIL. I DON'T KNOW. SHOULD I BE TURNED? - YEAH, I THINK YOU... - I'M GONNA TURN MY BACK, THOUGH. - I'M-A TURN MY BACK, THOUGH. - GO AHEAD. - Kayla: OH, MY GOSH. - YEAH. WE GENTLEMEN. Marcus: LADIES, WE HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR YOU, AND THEN, BESIDES, MY WIFE IS WATCHING, TOO. SO I'M GONNA TURN MY BACK. ALL RIGHT, SARAH'S LEFT, GUYS. I'M NOT HERE ANYMORE. - IT'S JUST KAYLA. - JUST ME. ANYTHING YOU WANNA SAY ON THE OVILUS OR THE REM-POD? DOCTOR... NORMAN. - NORMAN? - DR. NORMAN? SO, NORMAN, YOU'RE HERE WITH US. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL US, NORMAN? - IT SAYS "DECEIT." - DECEIT? WHO LIED? DID SARAH LIE TO YOU OR MISLEAD YOU? [ BEEPING ] [ ERRATIC BEEPS ] I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT PATTERN AT ALL. NO. [ BEEPING CONTINUES ] ♪♪ DID SARAH LIE TO YOU OR MISLEAD YOU? [ BEEPING ] [ ERRATIC BEEPS ] I HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT PATTERN HAPPEN AT ALL. - NO. - Kayla: WOW. - LET'S STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT. - YES. EVERYBODY, STEP BACK. Kayla: THIS IS INTENSE. Dalen: WOW. WE JUST WANT TO FIND OUT FOR SURE WHO YOU ARE. - DID YOU WORK FOR SARAH? [ CHIRPS ] - OKAY. - YES. WERE YOU AN ON-SITE DOCTOR? [ CHIRPS ] - YES. Dalen: FELLAS, LATER ON, WE SHOULD LOOK UP DR. NORMAN TO SEE IF HE REALLY WAS ON SARAH'S STAFF. OKAY. WERE YOU MAD THAT THIS WASN'T FINISHED? [ BEEPING ] SO THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HIS AREA. IT'S LIKE HIS OFFICE. SO DID IT NOT FINISH BECAUSE SARAH PASSED AWAY? [ BEEPING ] - AH. DID YOU JUST HELP SARAH? OR DID YOU HELP EVERYBODY? [ BEEPING ] - OKAY. - EVERYBODY. - EVERYBODY. Dalen: MAN, WITH SARAH'S WEALTH, IT DEFINITELY MAKES SENSE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE A DOCTOR IN HER INNER CIRCLE WHO WOULD COME TO THE HOUSE, MAN, FOR HER AND HER STAFF. - I GOT A QUESTION. SO I'VE BEEN COUGHING A LOT, DR. NORMAN. WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO HAVE HELPED ME? [ CHIRPS ] - YEAH. HE SAID, "YEAH." - Marcus: WHAT'S THAT? - OKAY. THAT'S KIND OF COOL. YOU THINK HE WOULD'VE GAVE YOU SOME TUSSIN? YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT CLEARS EVERYTHING UP. [ CHIRPS ] - YOU SEE? - WE TOLD HIM. - HE KNOW. 1800 WITH THE TUSSIN. - YEAH. - ALL RIGHT. WELL, DR. NORMAN, ARE THERE ANY MORE SPIRITS HERE WITH YOU? [ CHIRPS ] - YES. - WOW. ARE THERE OTHER SPIRITS IN THE HOUSE? [ CHIRPS ] NOW THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT THERE ARE OTHER SPIRITS AT THE HOUSE, WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND WRAP IT UP WITH KAYLA AND GET BACK TO OUR INVESTIGATION. - KAYLA, YOU'VE BEEN AMAZING. - OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING OUT TO HELP US OUT, MAN. - THANK YOU SO MUCH, KAYLA. - YEAH, OF COURSE. - WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT. - YOU'RE THE STAR OF THE NIGHT. NOW I GOT A SURPRISE PLANNED FOR MY BOYS. WELL, THAT'S JUST HOPING THAT WE DON'T GET LOST FIRST. DALEN, COME ON, MAN. WHERE IS THIS SURPRISE? - BRO, I'M LOOKING FOR IT. - THIS AIN'T IT? BRO, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING, BRO. BRO, I FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING LURKING AROUND EVERY CORNER IN HERE, BRO. WAIT. WHAT'S THAT? WHAT'S THAT? WHAT'S THAT? AH, I SEE YOU GUYS FOUND MY SURPRISE. OH. WHAT OR WHO IS YOUR SURPRISE? YOU GUYS, LISTEN. WE'RE IN THE SéANCE ROOM. IT'S MIDNIGHT. SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD ONLY BE BEFITTING IF MAYBE WE HAD A SéANCE. Dalen: THIS IS A KEY LOCATION IN THE STORY OF THE WINCHESTER MYSTERY HOUSE. EVERY NIGHT AT EXACTLY MIDNIGHT, SARAH WOULD CONDUCT A SéANCE IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE SPIRITS. IT IS BELIEVED THAT DURING THESE SéANCES, THE SPIRITS WOULD TELL SARAH HOW TO CONTINUE CONSTRUCTION ON THE REST OF THE HOUSE. LIKE, YOU HAVEN'T LEARNED YOUR LESSON, BRO? LIKE, Y'ALL DON'T DO WELL WITH THIS TYPE OF STUFF. - LIKE Y'ALL -- - MARCUS, HERE'S THE THING. THIS TIME, WE HAVE A PROFESSIONAL WITH US. Marcus: I DON'T PLAY THEM GAMES, BRO. SO THEY'RE PLAYING LIKE THIS LITTLE SéANCE THING IS GONNA BE FUN, BUT Y'ALL KNOW MARCUS DON'T DO NO SéANCES! LIKE NOTHING CAN GO WRONG WHEN YOU OPEN A PORTAL OF DEAD PEOPLE. [ SCOFFS ] I'M GOOD. NO, THANKS. CAN YOU JUST STAY CLOSE BY? ALL RIGHT, BRO, YOU GOT IT 'CAUSE... - [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] - HOW YOU GONNA SAY NO? - YOU KNOW WHAT? CHECK THIS OUT. - YEAH, YOU GOT A BRIGHT IDEA. HE AIN'T GONNA FIND HIS WAY. YEAH. RIGHT. WE'LL SEE YOU IN A MINUTE 'CAUSE YOU GONNA -- YOU AIN'T GONNA -- - YOU'LL BE RIGHT BACK. - WHICH WAY? - SEE? - I CAN'T FIND MY WAY OUT. I'D MUCH RATHER STAY WITH THE GROUP. Marcus: I MIGHT AS WELL BE BY MYSELF WITH THE GHOSTS THAN WITH THEM TWO DUMMIES RIGHT NOW. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. - MY NAME IS JEFF DWYER. - HEY, JEFF. I'M A PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR, RESEARCHER, AUTHOR, AND PSYCHIC. - HEY. I'M JUWAN. AND OCCASIONALLY, I CONDUCT SéANCES IN PLACES LIKE THIS TO ATTEMPT COMMUNICATION WITH SPIRITS. OKAY. SO HAVE YOU EVER DONE A SéANCE HERE BEFORE? NOT IN THIS PLACE. VERY FEW PEOPLE HAVE CONDUCTED SéANCES HERE. IN FACT, IN THE PAST 40 YEARS, THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE THAT I KNOW OF. WOW. SO HOW DO YOU FEEL BEING THE SECOND? IT'S GREAT. SO HOW DO WE GET THE SéANCE STARTED? WE'RE GONNA SIT AT THE TABLE AND GET CALM AND QUIET FOR A SHORT TIME, AND USUALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY -- THEY WILL SPEAK THROUGH OUR MINDS. THEY'LL PROJECT PSYCHIC ENERGY, WHICH IS THEIR VOICE, TO OUR MINDS. SO YOU MAY HEAR A STATEMENT IN YOUR MIND, AND WHAT WE DO IS JUST SPEAK THOSE WORDS. SO WE'RE GOING TO BE INVITING GHOSTS INTO OUR MIND TO SPEAK THROUGH US. MAN, I SAW THAT MOVIE. THAT'S CALLED "THE EXORCIST," AND THAT DIDN'T END WELL. I WILL NEVER SAY THIS AGAIN, BUT I MIGHT SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO MARCUS ON THIS ONE. Marcus: I DON'T WANNA KNOW WHAT THOSE GUYS ARE UP TO UPSTAIRS, AND I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO BE A PART OF IT. I'M OUT. SO WHAT I'M ABOUT TO DO IS DO WHAT I KNOW HOW TO DO, WHICH IS GO DO GOOD GHOST HUNTING. ♪♪ THIS HOUSE HAS DOORS THAT HAVE NO -- NO ROOM TO IT. I'M SO LOST RIGHT NOW. DANG IT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR HANDS ON THE TABLE. OKAY. AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THREE DEEP CLEANSING BREATHS. CLEAR YOUR MIND OF ALL THE THINGS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT AND FOCUS ENTIRELY UPON THIS ROOM AND THE HISTORY OF THE WINCHESTER MYSTERY HOUSE. DO MY EYES GOTTA BE CLOSED? NO. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CLOSED. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE. AND ANOTHER BREATH. [ INHALES SHARPLY ] HANDS FLAT ON THE TABLE AND RELAX. - DID YOU JUST TOUCH MY HAND? - Dalen: YEAH, BRO. - YES, I DID. - OKAY. JUST MAKING SURE. - [ JUWAN LAUGHS ] - Jeff: OKAY. THE DOORS, THE WINDOWS, AND THE PORTALS OF THE WINCHESTER MANSION ARE NOW OPEN TO SPIRITS. WE INVITE ANY SPIRITS HERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US, SPEAK THROUGH US, MAKE SOUNDS, MAKE MOVEMENTS, CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE TO LET US KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE THROUGH US. DO YOU FEEL A PRESENCE, DALEN? BRO, I DON'T WANT TO. THE TABLE'S VIBRATING. DO YOU FEEL THAT? YEAH. THAT'S NOT YOU? - NO. THIS TABLE'S VIBRATING. - I REALLY -- NO. I REALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE MOVING THE TABLE. I REALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE MOVING IT. NO. I'M FEELING IT ALL THE WAY UP MY ARMS TO MY HANDS. YEAH, MY HANDS. I GET A FEELING THAT THIS ROOM IS GETTING CROWDED, THOUGH. I-I FEEL THE SAME. YEAH. WE'RE GETTING FULL. IT'S NOT JUST US. ♪♪ THE TABLE'S VIBRATING. DO YOU FEEL THAT? Dalen: WE'VE BROUGHT IN JEFF, A PARANORMAL INVESTIGATOR AND PSYCHIC, TO LEAD A SéANCE IN THE SAME ROOM THAT SARAH WINCHESTER USED TO DO IT BACK IN THE DAY. I REALLY WISH I COULD ENJOY THIS, BUT TO BE QUITE HONEST, I'M FREAKED OUT. I GET A FEELING THAT THIS ROOM IS GETTING CROWDED, THOUGH. I-I FEEL THE SAME. THERE'S A FEMALE PRESENCE HERE. CAN YOU SAY YOUR NAME? IT IS MARIAN. MARIAN, DID YOU DIE IN THIS HOUSE? - NO, SHE DIDN'T. - I GOT "NO," TOO. YEAH. GOOD. SO WHY IS SHE HERE? DEVOTED... WHO IS SHE? ...NIECE. MARIAN WAS SARAH WINCHESTER'S NIECE AND LIVED HERE. SHE WAS THE ONE PERSON WHO MRS. WINCHESTER ALLOWED INTO THIS ROOM. MARIAN, WHY WAS THIS HOUSE BUILT? I GOT THE WORD "SAFETY." GREAT. I'M HEARING "SANCTUARY," WHICH IS VERY MUCH THE SAME. WHY WAS THIS HOUSE BUILT AS A SANCTUARY, AS A PLACE OF SAFETY? "SORROW." INTERESTING. I'M GETTING "REGRET." SO, MARIAN, WHY ARE YOU HERE WITH US NOW? SHE'S LOOKING OVER WHAT'S GOING ON HERE TONIGHT. ASK HER, ARE WE OFFENDING HER? IS SHE MAD THAT WE'RE HERE? NO. SHE RESPONDED, "NO." MARIAN, WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO, YOU KNOW, SPEAK WITH US. ♪♪ Marcus: SARAH BUILT THIS HOUSE LIKE A MAZE SO THE GHOSTS WOULD GET LOST. NOW I DON'T KNOW IF IT WORKED ON THE GHOSTS, BUT IT WORKS ON ME 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING. IS IT... WAIT. NO, IT'S THAT WAY. WHAT IS THIS? MAN... SO I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS STUPID IDEA THAT DALEN HAS WITH THIS SéANCE STUFF. SO I'M GONNA TRY TO GO MY OWN WAY, BUT I REALIZE I KEEP GETTING LOST AND I NEED A G.P.S. MAN, THESE STAIRS DON'T EVEN GO NOWHERE. THIS -- THESE STAIRS DON'T GO NOWHERE, MAN. THEY GO NOWHERE. ♪♪ ARE THERE ANY OTHER SPIRITS HERE? FEELING ANYTHING? HEARING ANYTHING? MNH-MNH.

WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT. ALL RIGHT. YEAH, WE'LL FOLLOW YOU THEN, MAN. MAN, SINCE YOU SEEN THE, UH -- SEE IF THE SPIRITS GUIDE YOU. SINCE ME AND JEFF BOTH MADE CONTACT WITH THE SPIRITS, SPECIFICALLY SARAH'S NIECE MARIAN... [ THUD ] - WATCH YOUR STEP HERE. - YEP. WE JUST GONNA HEAD BACK DOWNSTAIRS WITH HIM AND SEE WHAT OTHER SPIRITS WE CAN GET IN CONTACT WITH. SO WHEN I WENT AND GOT THE OVILUS AND THE THERMAL CAM, I... [ LOUD BANG ] - [ GASPS ] - WHAT THE ****?! - WHAT THE HELL? - WHAT YOU GRABBING ME FOR, JEFF? - [ LAUGHS ] - YOU SUPPOSED TO ALL RIGHT! YOU LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE GONNA FALL OVER. HOLD ON, JEFF. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING, BRO. YOU -- LIKE, YOU'RE A MEDIUM. YOU CAN'T BE SCARED WHEN STUFF ACTUALLY HAPPENS. THAT WAS A RESPONSE. THIS DOOR'S -- THIS DOOR'S OPEN. THAT DOOR'S OPEN. THAT DOOR'S OPEN. Juwan: BRO, I'M TELLING YOU, THIS DOOR WAS OPEN. Dalen: I GOT THIS OVILUS, MAN. WAS THAT YOU THAT CLOSED THIS DOOR? - JEFF... - KAREN. WHO IS KAREN? YOUR NAME IS KAREN? IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TELL US, KAREN? WHAT WAS YOUR OCCUPATION, KAREN? - PRINTED. - "PRINTED." SECRETARY? MRS. WINCHESTER HAD A SECRETARY WHO LIVED HERE FOR MANY YEARS. I DON'T KNOW HER NAME. MAYBE IT WAS KAREN. ARE YOU MRS. WINCHESTER'S SECRETARY? WAS THAT YOUR JOB? - SHEPHERD. - SHE WAS HER SHEPHERD. Juwan: THAT MEANS SHE WATCHED OVER HER. WATCHED OVER HER. OKAY.

Trying to use a lifeline? [ LAUGHS ] - Bro, I have gotten lost 20 TIMES DOWN HERE. OKAY. WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE US TO MEET YOU? LET'S MEET IN THE VENETIAN DINING ROOM. COPY THAT. WE'RE ON THE WAY. HOPEFULLY I'M ON THE WAY, TOO, IF I CAN FIND THIS THING. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I FEEL LIKE I FOUND SOMETHING RIGHT THERE. ♪♪ Marcus: GENTS, GENTS. YERP. YERP. YERP. - OH, YOU LOOK COMFORTABLE. - YERP.

WHAT THE... - AND THEN, MAN, THE SéANCE... - YES, DALEN. YOU DID OPEN THAT PORTAL UP WITH MY MAN JEFF. IT'S MARIAN. MARIAN WAS SARAH WINCHESTER'S NIECE AND LIVED HERE. I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S NOT THE VICTIMS THAT DIED AT THE HAND OF A WINCHESTER THAT'S HAUNTING SARAH. NO, I BELIEVE THAT SARAH SPOKE TO US. - YEAH. - KAREN. - SOMEBODY NAMED KAREN. - WE HAD THE DOCTOR. - DR. NORMAN. - WERE YOU AN ON-SITE DOCTOR? Dalen: YES. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HIS AREA. WERE YOU MAD THAT THIS WASN'T FINISHED? - YES. - WOW. YEAH, SO PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY WHO WORKED THERE, WHO HAD A HAND IN RUNNING THE SPOT, THEY'RE THE ONES WHO, I GUESS, JUST SEEM LIKE THEY CAN'T LEAVE. OUR MISSION TONIGHT WAS TO FIND OUT WHO WAS HAUNTING THE WINCHESTER MYSTERY HOUSE. WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF THE SPIRITS OF THOSE KILLED BY THE WINCHESTER RIFLE. SO MAYBE SARAH LIVED HER LIFE IN FEAR FOR NO REASON. OR MAYBE THE SPIRITS OF THE WINCHESTER VICTIMS WERE ALL PUT TO REST WITH HER DEATH. BASED ON OUR INVESTIGATION, IT SEEMS LIKE SARAH WINCHESTER HERSELF IS STILL HANGING AROUND THIS HOUSE, ALONG WITH SOME FAMILY MEMBERS AND MOST DEFINITELY THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED FOR SARAH. THEY'RE ALL JUST COHABITATING, LIVING IN THIS HOUSE. I SAY IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THIS HOUSE IS CERTIFIED. GHOST BROTHERS STAMPED -- HAUNTED. - BUT IN A GOOD WAY. - IN A GOOD WAY. - Juwan: IT IS CONFUSING, THOUGH. - Dalen: OH, IT'S CONFUSING, MAN.
