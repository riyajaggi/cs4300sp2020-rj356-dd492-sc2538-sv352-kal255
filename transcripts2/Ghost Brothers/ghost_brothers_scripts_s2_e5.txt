SHE WAS LEARNED IN VOODOO, AND SO WHEN SHE GOT HERE, THE SLAVES WERE TERRIFIED OF HER. WHAT WERE SOME OF THE HORRIBLE THINGS SHE DID TO THE SLAVES THAT GOT THEM SO SCARED? IN OUR OWN DUNGEON, THERE IS A SAMPLE OF, LIKE, A BEAR TRAP. AND SO THEY WOULD SET THE BEAR TRAPS OUT, AND THEY WOULD CATCH THEM. THEY WOULD SNAP THEIR LEG IN, MUTILATE THEIR LEGS. I MEAN, LIKE, THEY LIVED IN FEAR. IF ANNIE DIDN'T LIKE WHAT YOU WERE SAYING, ANNIE KILLED YOU. SHE KILLED SLAVE LOVERS, AS WELL AS HUSBANDS. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO EACH ONE OF HER HUSBANDS? OKAY, SO JOHN, THE FIRST HUSBAND, SHE POISONED HIM IN THE GENTLEMAN'S ROOM. THE SECOND HUSBAND WAS STABBED, AND THE THIRD ONE WAS STRANGLED TO DEATH.

TRYING TO ACT LIKE YOU AIN'T SCARED. Dalen: WHEW-WEE. IT DON'T FEEL RIGHT IN HERE. ALL RIGHT. NOW I'M IN ANNIE'S SITTING ROOM. THIS IS SUPPOSEDLY THE MOST ACTIVE ROOM IN THE HOUSE. IT HAS REPORTS OF APPARITIONS, DISEMBODIED VOICES AND CHAIRS BEING VIOLENTLY SHAKEN. AND THIS IS THE ROOM IN WHICH THE ARMOIRE DOOR OPENED BY ITSELF DURING OUR INTERVIEW. WHOA, DID YOU DO THAT? OKAY. WHILE WE WERE DOING A INTERVIEW, YOU OPENED UP THIS DOOR. ANNIE, IF YOU'RE HERE, PLEASE OPEN IT UP AGAIN. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] I DON'T FEEL LIKE I WOULD BE DOING THIS INVESTIGATION ANY JUSTICE IF I DIDN'T GO IN AND LOOK FOR MYSELF. [ CHUCKLES ] ALL RIGHT. [ SIGHS ] THIS MIGHT BE THE DUMBEST **** I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE. **** **** ♪♪ **** **** BRO! BRO, OKAY. IT LITERALLY FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS BREATHING IN THERE WITH ME. **** BRO! SO OBVIOUSLY THIS ROOM IS VERY ACTIVE. IT ALL CENTERS AROUND THAT. IF ANNIE'S BEHIND THE ACTIVITY THAT I'VE ALREADY EXPERIENCED IN HERE, THEN I WANT TO, FOR SURE, TRY AND ENGAGE WITH HER FURTHER. SO, ME AND JUWAN ARE IN THE DUNGEON RIGHT NOW. THERE'S BEEN CLAIMS OF DISEMBODIED VOICES, FURNITURE ACTUALLY MOVING ON ITS OWN. THIS IS WHERE ANNIE WOULD BRING RUNAWAY SLAVES AFTER THEY WERE CAUGHT. Juwan: OOH. SO I THINK WE SHOULD PULL OUT THESE DOUSING RODS. NOW, WHAT DO THESE DOUSING RODS DO? DOUSING RODS DETECT ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS, OR ENERGY, YOU SHOULD SAY, RIGHT? SO THAT COULD BE RUNNING WATER, OR THAT COULD BE A GHOST. IF THESE DOUSING RODS DETECT ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS... - MM-HMM. - ...THEY'LL CROSS. OH, OKAY. WHAT'S THAT? THESE ARE ARTIFACTS OF THE PLACE, AND YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S ARTIFACTS, THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT SOMEONE WHO RELATED TO THESE PIECES WHILE THEY WERE ALIVE IS STILL ATTACHED TO THEM IN THE AFTERLIFE, AND NOW THEIR SPIRITS ARE JUST HAUNTING THIS PROPERTY. MAYBE SLAVES, THEY MIGHT HAVE USED ONE OF THESE PLATES. THEY HAVE A MACHETE OVER HERE. MAYBE THAT WAS USED FOR WORK OR EVEN ON SOMEONE. IF HISTORY HAD A FEELING, IT WOULD BE WHAT I FEEL RIGHT NOW. - WHAT'S THAT? - JUST LIKE, YOU FEEL LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING HISTORIC, BRO. IF HISTORY HAD A FEELING... THAT'S HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW. ...THAT'S HOW YOU WOULD FEEL RIGHT NOW. YEAH. IF HISTORY HAD A FEELING... - LIKE HISTORY? - MM-HMM. TOUCH ONE OF THESE AND SEE IF YOU DON'T FEEL WHAT I FEEL. YOU BEEN LISTENING TO A LOT OF GUCCI. HEY, ANNIE. SO THERE ARE SOME RUMORS THAT SOME PRETTY BAD STUFF WAS GOING DOWN IN THIS HOUSE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME ABOUT THAT? INSIDE THAT ROOM, SHE HAS TWO ORIGINAL PIECES THAT ARE TRUE TO THIS HOUSE. IT'S THE MIRROR AND HER SEWING TABLE. SO SHE STILL MIGHT BE ATTACHED TO THEM, SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO HAVE A SILENT MOMENT WITH ANNIE AND LET ANNIE KNOW THAT I'M HERE AND I'M LISTENING, AND I KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY. WE'VE HEARD THE HORRIBLE, GRUESOME STORY OF THIS MASS-MURDERING WHITE WITCH WHO KILLED HER THREE HUSBANDS AND SLAVES. BUT WHAT DROVE HER TO THAT? OH, I JUST GOT A HUGE CHILL. I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOU, ANNIE. WHAT MAKES YOU KILL? DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO YOU, ANNIE, IN YOUR PAST, THAT DROVE YOU TO THAT? IT WAS RUMORED THAT YOU HAD AN AFFAIR, YOUR HUSBAND CAUGHT YOU AND HE BEAT YOU. BUT THEN YOU DID KIND OF ONE-UP HIM WHEN YOU KILLED HIM, ANNIE. DID YOUR OTHER HUSBAND HARM YOU, AS WELL? WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH ME, ANNIE? Marcus: SO, MAYBE IF WE GET THAT REM-POD, WE CAN KIND OF SEE IF THERE'S ANY ACTIVITY OR EVEN A CONFIRMATION THAT THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN HERE. ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHERE I WANT TO SIT IT UP AT? - WHERE? - RIGHT BY THAT BEAR TRAP. THAT MIGHT BRING SOME CONCENTRATION TO THIS AREA. - TEST THINGS OUT. - [ REM-POD CHIRPS ] Juwan: THERE YOU GO.

WERE YOU AFRAID OF ANNIE? DO YOU THINK ANNIE FOUND PLEASURE IN BRINGING YOU PAIN? YOU WOULD THINK THIS DUNGEON WOULD NOT BE SILENT. LIKE, IT WOULD PROBABLY BE... - ALIVE. ...SCREAMS, ALL TYPES OF SOUNDS. YEAH, MAN. I MEAN, PEOPLE WERE BEING TORTURED HERE ON A REGULAR BASIS.

NO REMNANTS OF A BODY WAS IN THERE. THAT JUST MAKES ME WONDER, LIKE, WHAT OTHER SPIRITS COULD BE ROAMING THIS PROPERTY? BUT THE SPIRITS WE CAME IN CONTACT WITH TONIGHT ALL SEEM TO CENTER AROUND ANNIE PALMER AND THE PEOPLE SHE MESSED WITH. MAN, THERE'S COUNTLESS. WE'VE GOTTEN CONTACT FROM SLAVES IN THE DUNGEON. TRUE, WE DID. Juwan: AND PEOPLE WERE BEING TORTURED HERE ON A REGULAR BASIS. LIKE, I DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE A OUNCE OF REMORSE DOWN HERE. - [ REM-POD CHIRPING ] - LIKE I SAID. - GET THE HECK OUT OF HERE. - LIKE I SAID. WE'VE GOTTEN CONTACT IN ANNIE'S SITTING ROOM.

YOU SAY THIS PLACE IS HAUNTED OR NOT? MAN, THIS JOINT IS -- HOLD THIS. HOLD THIS. YOU GOT TO PUT YOUR BACK INTO IT? THIS HAND GOT TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THIS HAND TO COME DOWN BECAUSE THIS HOUSE IS "GHOST BROTHERS" CERTIFIED STAMPED HAUNTED, DAWG. - THERE IS IT. - THE "GHOST BROTHERS" JUST STAMPED A HAUNTED HOUSE IN JAMAICA, BABY. IT'S PRETTY, BUT IT'S HAUNTED. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THAT LETS ME KNOW? IT IS PRETTY. WE SHOULD TRY TO DO THIS INTERNATIONAL THING A LOT MORE, GUYS. - LET'S GO TO RIO. I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME GHOSTS IN RIO. THERE'S DEFINITELY GHOSTS IN RIO. OUR MISSION TONIGHT WAS TO FIND OUT WHO'S ACTUALLY HAUNTING THE ROSE HALL. BASED ON OUR EVIDENCE, IT SEEMS LIKE FOR SURE IT'S ANNIE PALMER, A.K.A. THE WHITE WITCH OF THE ROSE HALL, AND ALL THE SLAVES SHE MURDERED ON THIS PLANTATION. AND AS FOR ANNIE'S DEAD HUSBANDS, WE DIDN'T REALLY MAKE ANY CONTACT WITH THEM. SO LET'S JUST HOPE THAT THEY'RE RESTING IN PEACE, PER SE.
