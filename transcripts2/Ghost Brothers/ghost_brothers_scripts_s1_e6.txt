THIS ONE'S A DOOZY. YEAH, IT'S IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA. - IT'S IN G.A.? - YEAH, BRO. A COUPLE HOURS OUTSIDE OF ATLANTA. THE FITZPATRICK HOTEL, MAN. BUT KNOW WHAT'S COOL ABOUT THIS PLACE, BRO? THIS HOTEL WAS ACTUALLY BUILT ON TOP OF A CEMETERY AT ONE POINT IN TIME. WHY IS THAT COOL? BRO, 'CAUSE IT'S BUILT ON TOP OF A CEMETERY. WAIT. OKAY, SO WE'RE GONNA INVESTIGATE A HOTEL THAT WAS BUILT ON TOP OF A CEMETERY, LIKE -- LIKE, SOMETIMES I REALLY THINK Y'ALL FORGET WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY. I'M STILL A BROTHER, THOUGH. I STILL GET, LIKE, QUESTIONABLE ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS, LIKE, YOU KNOW, THAT. THE FITZPATRICK HOTEL WAS BUILT IN 1898 BY TWO BROTHERS, JOHN AND THOMAS FITZPATRICK. THOMAS LIVED ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF THE HOTEL WITH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER. ALSO, THERE IS THIS WOMAN NAMED POLLY BARCLAY, BRO. SHE WAS ACTUALLY HANGED FOR ALLEGEDLY KILLING HER HUSBAND. AND PEOPLE THINK THAT HER BODY MIGHT BE ACTUALLY BURIED IN THE CEMETERY THAT'S UNDERNEATH THE HOTEL. - WORD. - YEP. IT'S JUST, LIKE, BODY ON TOP OF BODY - ON TOP OF BODY IN THIS HOTEL. - DANG, BROTHER. AND GUESS WHAT ELSE, THOUGH, BRO. - WHAT'S UP? - IT'S BEEN SAID THAT A WOMAN WAS ACTUALLY PUSHED OUT OF A WINDOW - AND WAS KILLED. - WORD? YEAH. IN THE 1930s, LOCAL LEGEND STATES THAT AN ANGRY WIFE FOUND HER HUSBAND'S MISTRESS AT THE HOTEL AND PUSHED HER OUT A WINDOW. - WORD? - UP. ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE HAUNTING THIS HOTEL? IT'S A POSSIBILITY, MAN. YOU KNOW OUR JOB IS ALWAYS FIND OUT, "A," IS THE PLACE HAUNTED, AND, "B," WHO'S HAUNTING IT, MAN? THERE'S A TON OF RECENT ACTIVITY. YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOT TO DO, FELLAS? - WHAT'S THAT? - MAN, WE GOT TO, LIKE, CALL THE OWNER, BRO, OF THE HOTEL, CHRISTY TODD. SEE IF SHE'LL LET US COME OUT THERE. HEY, MISS CHRISTY. THIS IS DALEN. I'M DOING WONDERFUL. SO, MISS CHRISTY, CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT ANY PARANORMAL ACTIVITY THAT YOU'VE HEARD OR MAYBE EXPERIENCED SINCE YOU'VE BEEN THERE? - A LITTLE GIRL? - YEAH. - THAT'S CREEPY. - YEAH. YEAH, THAT'S VERY CREEPY. THE LITTLE GIRLS ARE ALWAYS THE ONES IN THE HORROR MOVIES. SO, MISS CHRISTY, IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THE SPIRITS ARE FEMALES THAT ARE IN THE HOUSE. THAT SEEMS UNUSUAL. WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO MAYBE COME OUT TO THE HOTEL AND, YOU KNOW, MAYBE GET A TOUR, WELL, WE'RE EXCITED. WE HOPE TO SEE YOU REALLY SOON. YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY. ALL RIGHT. MAN, I'M REALLY CURIOUS TO SEE WHO'S, LIKE, REALLY HAUNTING THIS PLACE, BRO. WE'RE GONNA GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. WELL, IT'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT, FELLAS. STRAIGHT GHOST IT? - STRAIGHT GHOST IT. - STRAIGHT GHOST IT. WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, HERE WE COME. TIME TO START GHOSTING. HERE WE ARE, BROTHERS. WASHINGTON, GEORGIA. A LOT OF CRAZY STUFF'S HAPPENED DOWN HERE, MAN. I FEEL LIKE ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS IS THAT THE FITZ IS STRUCTURED ON TOP OF A CEMETERY THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE LATE 1700s. CHRISTY'S ASSUMING THAT, THAT COULD BE A REASON OF THE PARANORMAL ACTIVITY ON HER PROPERTY. THAT IS CRAZY. BRO, WHAT'S EVEN CRAZIER IS, LIKE, BEFORE THEY BUILT THE HOTEL, THEY HAD TO REMOVE, LIKE, THE HEADSTONES. SO THEY MOVED THE HEADSTONES AWAY. BUT THEY LEFT THE BODIES STILL BURIED. THAT'S CREEPY. I SAY THAT'S COST-EFFECTIVE. - OKAY. - OKAY. THEY DIDN'T EVEN MOVE THE BODIES. THEY'RE JUST LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'LL TAKE THESE HEADSTONES SOMEWHERE. LEAVE THEM BODIES THERE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. THEY AIN'T HURTING NOBODY." "AIN'T NOBODY GONNA KNOW." Y'ALL KNOW I ALWAYS COME WITH SURPRISES. YOU DO. Y'ALL DO GOT Y'ALL BAGS IN THE CAR, RIGHT? - YEAH, OF COURSE. - I BOOKED US THREE ROOMS AT THE FITZ, GUYS. - WHAT IS THE -- - WAIT. WAIT. WHERE? I WILL PULL THIS CAR OVER. WHAT'D YOU JUST SAY? I BOOKED US THREE ROOMS AT THE FITZPATRICK HOTEL. IF WE'RE GONNA INVESTIGATE THIS HOTEL, I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD ONLY BE BEFITTING IF WE STAYED THERE. SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU, DALEN. I JUST FEEL LIKE, BRO, WE GONNA DO IT, MAN, - WHY TIPTOE? - I THINK IT'S TERRIBLE. I AM GONNA FIGHT MYSELF TO SLEEP. I'M JUST GONNA PULL THE COVERS OVER MY HEAD LIKE A CHILD. YO, IS THIS THE HOTEL? YEAH, BOY. THIS THE RITZ? SNAP. THERE'S A CAFé. I'M HUNGRY, BRO. I NEED TO GO. BRO, NO. WE'RE ABOUT TO CHECK IN. NO, WE'RE ABOUT TO GO CHECK IN AND GET SOMETHING TO EAT. BRO. THE HOTEL'S RIGHT HERE, MARCUS! THAT'S WHY THE CAFé'S RIGHT HERE. MARCUS. THAT BOY ALWAYS TRYING TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT. HI, THERE. HOW ARE YOU GUYS? - HOW'S IT GOING, MAN? - GOOD. I'M ROBERT. WELCOME TO TALK OF THE TOWN. HEY, ROBERT. HOW YOU DOING? MARCUS. DOING GOOD. Y'ALL LOOK LIKE SOME HUNGRY GUYS. YES, SIR. WELL, YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT PLACE. I HEARD THAT THIS PLACE IS ACTUALLY BUILT ON TOP OF A CEMETERY. - YEAH, IT IS. - AW! MAN! BUT WE DON'T SERVE DEAD FOLKS. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. COOL. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THIS BEING BUILT ON A CEMETERY ADDS TO THE PARANORMAL ACTIVITY HERE? I'M SURE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW, SPIRITS JUST KIND OF HANGING ON. HAVE YOU HAD ANY EXPERIENCES OR OCCURRENCES - BECAUSE OF THAT? - YEAH. A COUPLE. A COUPLE? I BUSED TABLES ONE DAY. AND WHEN I LEANED OVER, ONE OF THE BASKETS JUST WENT SHOOP AND SMASHED UP AGAINST THE WALL. WAIT, SO YOU WERE HOLDING THE BASKET? IT JUST WENT POW. THE RUNNING GAG IS MISS FITZPATRICK'S BEEN HERE. NOW THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE ACTIVITY IN THE CAFé, I'M DEFINITELY ANXIOUS TO HEAR WHAT HOTEL OWNERS MIKE AND CHRISTY HAVE TO SAY. YOU GUYS HAVE A BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHMENT HERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'RE REALLY GLAD TO HAVE YOU GUYS. SO TELL ME ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THE BUILDING. IT WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT IN 1898 BY THE FITZPATRICK BROTHERS. THEIR FAMILY OWNED THE LAND, AND THEY BUILT THE HOTEL ON THE SITE. THEY LIVED HERE WHEN IT FIRST OPENED FOR ABOUT 5 OR 6 YEARS. OKAY. LATER ON, THE FITZPATRICK BROTHERS PASSED AWAY, BOTH OF THEM. THEY LEFT NO WILL. THOMAS FITZPATRICK'S DEATH IN 1911 THREW THE FAMILY INTO A FEUD SINCE HE DID NOT HAVE A WILL. HIS SISTERS FILED A LAWSUIT, WHICH EVENTUALLY LED TO THE SALE OF THE FITZPATRICK HOTEL. IN 1952, THE HOTEL'S DOORS CLOSED FOR GOOD. AND THE FITZPATRICKS' ROOMS WERE VACANT FOR DECADES. SO DID YOU GUYS KNOW THAT THE PROPERTY WAS HAUNTED BEFORE Y'ALL BOUGHT IT OR... WELL, THERE IS A LOCAL LEGEND THAT A LADY WAS PUSHED OUT OF A THIRD-STORY WINDOW. APPARENTLY, THERE WAS A NEW YEAR'S EVE BALL IN THE BALLROOM. AND A GENTLEMAN HAD COME WITH HIS WIFE. BUT HE HAD KEPT HIS MISTRESS IN ONE OF THE THIRD-FLOOR ROOMS. HE BROUGHT HIS WIFE HERE WHILE HIS MISTRESS WAS HERE? YES. - HE TRIED IT. - THAT'S 101. THAT'S A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. THE WIFE FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AND WENT UP TO ROOM 307 AND PUSHED THE MISTRESS OUT THE WINDOW. NOW, SEVERAL OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE COMMENTED THAT THERE IS A STRANGE ENERGY IN THAT ROOM. HAVE YOU HAD ANY, LIKE, PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AT THIS HOTEL? FOUR OR FIVE YEARS AGO. AND, WE HAD SHUT DOWN FOR A WEEK. AND EVERYTHING WAS OFF. WE LOCKED UP. WE LEFT. IT WAS ABOUT 10:00 THAT NIGHT. ROBERT CALLED AND WANTED TO KNOW IF WE HAD MEANT TO LEAVE ALL THE LIGHTS ON. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN THE TIME WE LEFT AND TIME WE FOUND 'EM, BUT THE BUILDING WAS LOCKED. - WE HAD NO GUESTS. - AND WE HAD NO GUESTS. - BECAUSE WE WERE SHUT DOWN. - BECAUSE WE WERE SHUT DOWN. BUT THE LIGHTS WERE ALL BACK ON. SO THESE GHOSTS WERE JUST, LIKE, RUNNING UP Y'ALL'S LIGHT BILL, AND Y'ALL WAS COOL WITH THAT? YEAH, I GUESS THAT'S WHAT WAS HAPPENING. WHAT CAN YOU DO? EVEN THOUGH MIKE AND CHRISTY HAVE EXPERIENCED THEIR OWN ACTIVITY, CHRISTY SAID THAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY TALK TO THE CO-OWNER, JIM, ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER CLAIMS FROM THE HOTEL. WHO DO YOU THINK IS HAUNTING THIS HOTEL? I THINK THE PRIMARY PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE ARE THE FITZPATRICK FAMILY. THE FAMILY STAYED IN THIS SUITE ACROSS THE FRONT. AND THE VERY END ROOM, ROOM 200, WAS THE BEDROOM. IT'S VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO GO IN. ACTUALLY, IT FRIGHTENS ME. THE OTHER THING THAT HAS HAPPENED ON THIS FLOOR QUITE OFTEN IS, A LITTLE GIRL LIKES TO PLAY IN THE HALLS. SHE LIKES TO SORT OF WAVE AT YOU OR RUN UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS. JIM, MAN, SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE A PRETTY, PRETTY ACTIVE HOTEL HERE. WE'RE EXCITED TO GET TO INVESTIGATING IT. ALL RIGHT. FELLAS, SEEMS LIKE THIS PLACE HAS A LOT OF CLAIMS AND A LOT OF FEMALE SPIRITS, MAN. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN HERE. OUR MISSION TONIGHT IS TO FIND OUT WHAT SPIRITS STILL HAUNT THIS HISTORIC HOTEL. WE HAVE THE GRAVEYARD, WE HAVE -- DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE MISTRESS. YEAH. AND THEN ALL THE FITZPATRICKS. WHOO! I HOPE YOU GUYS ARE READY FOR TONIGHT, BABY. LET'S JUST KNOW WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT WHO'S ACTUALLY HAUNTING THIS PLACE. NOW ALL WE GOT TO DO IS WAIT FOR NIGHTFALL. - HEY, FELLAS. - WHAT'S UP? THIS LOOKS LIKE IT'S ABOUT THAT TIME. IT'S TIME TO GET THIS PARTY STARTED. TIME TO POP THE TRUNK ON THESE GHOSTS. YEAH, YEAH. HERE WE GO, GUYS. SOME GOOD STUFF. HERE, I GOT THE CAMERA FOR YOU. MY CAM, MY TRUSTY CAM. WE GOT OUR EVP RECORDER. WE ALSO GOT OUR TABLETS. OKAY. TO THE INVESTIGATION, FELLAS. SO WHILE MARCUS AND JUWAN ARE IN THE HOTEL, I'M GONNA START BY INVESTIGATING THE CAFé TO SEE IF I CAN GET A RESPONSE FROM ONE OF THE FITZPATRICKS OR POSSIBLY SOMEONE BURIED BENEATH THE HOTEL. IF THAT'S NOT THE CREEPIEST DOOR YOU EVER HEARD IN YOUR LIFE. SO WE'RE UP IN THE DINING AREA WHERE ROBERT SAID HE HAD THE BASKET FLY OUT OF HIS HAND AND LITERALLY SMASH INTO THE WALL. I FEEL LIKE THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT PLACE TO TRY TO DO A FLASHLIGHT COMMUNICATION SESSION. WE GONNA GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF WHO IS HAUNTING THIS PLACE. ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS OF THE FITZPATRICK FAMILY HERE? MISS FITZPATRICK, IS IT YOU THAT'S HERE? ALL RIGHT, OKAY. THAT'S TERRIFYING. I'M IN THE CAFé RIGHT NOW DOING THE FLASHLIGHT TEST. HOPEFULLY, WE CAN CONNECT WITH MISS FITZPATRICK SINCE ROBERT FEELS SO ADAMANT ABOUT HER BEING IN HERE. MISS FITZPATRICK, IS IT YOU THAT'S HERE? ALL RIGHT, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. AND YEP. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S TERRIFYING. SINCE MISS FITZPATRICK REACHED OUT TO ME, GOT TO BRING ONE OF THE GUYS BACK IN TO SEE IF WE CAN CAPTURE ANY MORE ACTIVITY. THIS STUFF IS REAL, MAN. YO. IS THAT YOUR WAY OF, LIKE, LETTING EVERYBODY KNOW YOU WAS COMING? JUST LETTING WHOEVER'S IN HERE KNOW, BRO. JUWAN AND I ARE IN THE CAFé. AND I'M GLAD I'M NOT ALONE BECAUSE I'M STILL FREAKED OUT FROM WHAT HAPPENED. SINCE ONE OF THE FITZPATRICK FAMILY MEMBERS REACHED OUT TO ME, WE BROUGHT A THERMAL CAM THIS TIME TO SEE IF WE CAN CAPTURE ANY MORE ACTIVITY. THIS IS REALLY, LIKE, MY GUIDING LIGHT RIGHT NOW. IT'S LIKE I CAN ACTUALLY WATCH YOUR BACK FROM HERE. YEAH, BUT ARE YOU WATCHING MY BACK? LOOK, YOU'RE, LIKE, THE BAROMETER RIGHT NOW. SO IF I PUT MY HAND ON THIS TABLE... IT'S, LIKE, THE TRANSFER OF HEAT, TRANSFER OF ENERGY. ALL RIGHT, TAKE IT OFF. YEAH, THAT'S DOPE. HEADING INTO THE KITCHEN AREA. ALL RIGHT. WE GOT HIS RECEIPTS HERE. WHAT OTHER KIND OF PIECES OF GEAR -- WHAT GEAR ARE YOU USING NOW? IT WAS LIKE AND IT DIED. WHAT OTHER KIND OF PIECES OF GEAR -- WHAT GEAR ARE YOU USING NOW? WHOA. AND THAT'S NOT NORMAL. HIS BATTERY WAS THREE-QUARTERS FULL. AND, ALL OF A SUDDEN, I HEAR THIS WEIRD RUMBLE. THAT KIND OF FREAKED ME OUT. AND THEN HIS BATTERY JUST DRAINED RIGHT THEN AND THERE. HIS BATTERY JUST DIED. AND IT WAS JUST RIGHT WHEN HE WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COUNTER. SO MAYBE I SHOULD GO BACK AND SEE IF SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS TO MY MIKE. SO I WAS BY THE CREDIT CARD MACHINE AND THE CELLPHONE AND ANOTHER CREDIT CARD MACHINE. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT COULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO TO DRAIN THE BATTERY, OMAR? ANY TIME THERE'S A DRAINAGE IN BATTERIES LIKE WHAT JUST HAPPENED, IT CAN BE LINKED TO THE PRESENCE OF SOME TYPE OF SPIRIT. SO I WENT BACK. AND I REPLAYED WHAT WE RECORDED IN THE CAFé. AND SO I DISCOVERED SOMETHING ELSE KINDA CREEPY. WE GOT HIS RECEIPTS HERE. DUDE. DO YOU HEAR THAT? - I HEARD A BREATH. - YEAH. IT WAS A BREATH RIGHT BEFORE YOUR MIKE WENT OUT. AND THAT WASN'T YOUR BREATH. IT WASN'T MY BREATH. IN MY CAREER, I'VE NEVER HEARD A MIKE LOSE POWER LIKE THAT. IT'S LIKE THAT BREATH, LIKE, WHATEVER IT WAS, JUST DRAINED THAT BATTERY AT THAT MOMENT. OMAR, MAN, PLAY IT ONE MORE TIME, BRO. ALL RIGHT. WE GOT HIS RECEIPTS HERE. RIGHT THERE! BY THE SOUND OF THAT, IT WAS RIGHT UP ON YOUR MIKE. DEMONIC. WHAT'S UP, PLAYER? - GOOD, MAN. - WHAT'S UP, BRO? ALL RIGHT, FELLAS. MAN, LOOK. NOW WE KNOW THAT THERE'S AT LEAST ONE FEMALE SPIRIT IN THE HOTEL. LET'S SEE WHO ELSE IS HERE. I SAY WE GO AHEAD AND SPLIT UP. - OKAY. - SOUNDS GOOD. SO, MARCUS, YOU GO TO ROOM 307, SINCE THAT'S WHERE ALL THE ACTIVITY IS. WAIT, HOLD UP A SEC, DALEN WANTS ME TO GO UP TO ROOM 307, WHICH IS THE ROOM THAT THE MISTRESS GOT THROWN OUT OF. YOU'RE REALLY GONNA HAVE THAT ENERGY AROUND ME? WHY DON'T YOU SLEEP IN THAT ROOM? YOU SCARED, MAN? I'LL GO WITH YOU. I MEAN, COOL. THAT LEAVES ME BY MYSELF. THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD PLAN. LIKE, ROOM 200. THERE WE GO. YOU GO TO 200. WE'LL GO TO 307. BRO, BUT DON'T THAT DEFEAT THE PURPOSE OF US INVESTIGATING BY OURSELF? NO. WE'RE SPLITTING UP. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID, RIGHT? MAN, SHUT UP. NO 'CAUSE YOU GOT SOMEBODY GOING WITH YOU. SHUT UP. WE'RE ON THE THIRD FLOOR. THIS THE CREEPIEST PLACE WE'VE INVESTIGATED BY FAR. SO WHY DO YOU THINK DALEN WOULD WANT TO STAY HERE TONIGHT? IT'S LIKE, NORMALLY, WHEN WE DO SOME INVESTIGATIONS, WE GET TO DO OUR INVESTIGATION AND WE CAN LEAVE. BUT IT'S LIKE, NOW, WE'RE, LIKE, ACTUALLY SLEEPING WITH WHATEVER WE'RE INVESTIGATING. IT'S KIND OF LIKE, YOU KNOW, SLEEPING WITH THE LIONS IN THE DEN. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? THAT'S HOW I, ESPECIALLY, FEEL 'CAUSE I'M IN 307. ROOM 307 IS A HOT SPOT FOR ACTIVITY IN THE HOTEL. A LOCAL LEGEND HAS IT THAT AN ENRAGED WIFE THREW HER HUSBAND'S MISTRESS OUT THE WINDOW TO HER DEATH. APPARITIONS HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THIS ROOM, INCLUDING A LITTLE GIRL TWIRLING. WHOA. IT'S THE -- **** - WHAT WAS THAT? - MY BAG. - YOUR PERSONAL STUFF. - MY PERSONAL STUFF. YOU AIN'T EVEN GOTTEN COMFORTABLE YET, MAN. YOUR BAG'S STILL PACKED. YOU THINK WE CAN GET COMFORTABLE IN HERE, DAWG? HERE WE ARE. ROOM 200. JIM FEELS LIKE IT'S THE HORRIBLE ENERGY COMES FROM THIS ROOM. HE OWNS THIS HOTEL AND WILL NOT GO INTO THIS ONE ROOM. AND THEY GOT ME HERE GOING IN HERE BY MYSELF. MAN. WHY DOES MY ROOM HAVE SO MANY MIRRORS? IN THE OLD TIMES, THEY USED TO SAY THAT MIRRORS WERE, LIKE, PORTALS TO THE OTHER SIDE. SO THEY ACTUALLY USED TO COVER THEM DURING FUNERALS. - AND THEN YOU HAVE THIS. - MY GOD! LOOK AT THIS MIRROR, MAN. THAT'S FRESH OUT THE LEGION OF DOOM. THIS IS FROM THE ASHLEY FURNITURE SECTION OF HORROR MOVIES. DO YOU REMEMBER THE GAME BLOODY MARY? - I DO. - MAYBE WE CAN GET A RESPONSE FROM THE MISTRESS. BUT SEE, THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, LIKE... I'M JUST SAYING, JUWAN. LISTEN, BRO, BLACK PEOPLE DON'T PLAY GAMES LIKE THAT. SO THERE'S THIS OLD FOLKLORE THAT IF YOU SAY "BLOODY MARY" IN THE MIRROR THREE TIMES THAT A GHOST WILL APPEAR. MY WIFE DON'T WANT ME HAVING NO MISTRESSES, LIVE OR DEAD. LIKE, LET'S LEAVE THE PORTALS CLOSED. LET'S JUST ASK QUESTIONS FOR WHO'S HERE. YOU FEEL WHAT I'M SAYING? - HOLD THE CAMERA FOR ME, MAN. - DUDE, NO. - WHY AM I EVEN INCLUDED -- - HOW DOES IT GO? BLOODY MARY, BLOODY MARY, BLOODY MARY. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IT WAS, LIKE, I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE I CLOSED MY EYES AND COUNTED LONG ENOUGH, BUT I WAS LIKE, MAN -- WHAT WAS THAT? DO YOU REMEMBER THE GAME BLOODY MARY? I DO. LISTEN, BRO, BLACK PEOPLE DON'T PLAY GAMES LIKE THAT. SO ME AND JUWAN ARE IN MY ROOM, THE ONE I'M SLEEPING IN, WHICH IS 307. AND HE WANTS TO PLAY THIS GAME, BLOODY MARY. SO THAT HE CAN CONTACT THE SPIRIT OF THE MISTRESS THAT WAS ACTUALLY PUSHED OUT OF THIS WINDOW. BLOODY MARY, BLOODY MARY, BLOODY MARY. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IT WAS, LIKE, I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE I CLOSED MY EYES AND COUNTED LONG ENOUGH, BUT I WAS, LIKE, MAN -- WHAT WAS THAT? BRO, LIKE, I REALLY HEARD THAT MOVE. SEE? THAT'S WHY I DON'T PLAY THEM GAMES, DAWG. BECAUSE, LIKE, I GOT TO SLEEP HERE NOW. AND IT -- YOU'RE NOT HEARING ME. WHEN I SAY MOVE -- NO, THIS MOVED. AND I HEARD... AFTER SAYING "BLOODY MARY," THREE TIMES IN THE MIRROR, THE TWO GLASSES ON THE TABLE CLICKED TOGETHER. THAT COULD DEFINITELY BE THE MISTRESS WHO WAS KILLED IN THIS ROOM OR EVEN THE LITTLE GIRL WHOSE APPARITION IS ALSO SEEN HERE. NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU'RE TRYING TO, LIKE, REALLY CONVEY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME, ALL IT'S DOING IS ADDING TO ME BEING MORE ANGRY THAT YOU WOULD EVEN START THAT UP IN MY ROOM, CRAZY AS THAT IS. IT WAS THE MIRROR. OKAY. ARE YOU HEARING ME, JUWAN? YOU SET UP SOMETHING IN MY ROOM. AND NOW I GOT TO, LIKE, SLEEP IN HERE KNOWING THAT THAT POSSIBLY WORKED. I DON'T KNOW, BRO. WHY WOULD YOU EVEN DO THAT IN MY ROOM WHEN YOU KNOW, WITHIN A MATTER OF HOURS, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SLEEP IN THE ROOM? DO THAT IN YOUR ROOM! HOW DO I, LIKE, REVERSE IT? THAT'S THE PROBLEM. LIKE, YOU CAN'T START SOMETHING THAT YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO REVERSE. YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING? LIKE, YOU JUST PROBABLY UNLOCKED SOME STUFF IN MY ROOM. I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD LOOK THAT UP, "HOW TO CLOSE THE MIRROR PORTAL." THIS SAYS... YOU GOT SOME SAGE? I GOT SOME CINNAMON. - YOU GOT SOME WHAT? - CINNAMON. - YOU KNOW, I HAD A FRIEND -- - WHY DO YOU HAVE CINNAMON? BECAUSE, ACTUALLY, ONE OF THE BARBERS AT MY SHOP TOLD ME THAT IF YOU HAVE A STICK OF CINNAMON IN YOUR POCKET THAT THAT KIND OF KEEPS YOU PROTECTED. AND I CARRY IT EVERY TIME, YOU KNOW, WE DO AN INVESTIGATION. WHY WOULDN'T YOU GET ENOUGH CINNAMON STICKS FOR THE THREE OF US? I MEAN... THAT IS KINDA TRUE. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT. BUT, I MEAN, I HAVE BEEN PRAYING FOR Y'ALL. BUT YOU DON'T THINK, LIKE, WE SHOULD GET A CINNAMON STICK, TOO? I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS GONNA WORK. THAT WAS SELFISH. NO, I REALLY JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF IT WAS GONNA WORK, AND IT JUST NEVER CROSSED MY MIND THAT... AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE A PACKAGE DEAL. HOW ABOUT THIS? WHAT IS THAT? BREAK A PIECE OF MY CINNAMON STICK. THIS RIGHT HERE COVER YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? ALL RIGHT. I THANK MARCUS FOR BEING VERY ALTRUISTIC IN PROVIDING ME WITH HALF OF HIS CINNAMON STICK. I'M GONNA TRY IT AGAIN. SHOULD I TRY IT AGAIN? NO. WE'RE GOOD. SO THIS IS THE SAME FLOOR THAT THOMAS FITZPATRICK LIVED ON WITH HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER. THE AIR IS SO THICK IN HERE. THAT WEIRD, SKETCHY ENERGY IS DEFINITELY ACTIVE IN THIS ROOM. LOOKS LIKE MAYBE I SHOULD DO AN EVP SESSION. MAYBE SEE WHERE THIS ENERGY'S COMING FROM. IT'S FOLLOWING -- WHATEVER IT IS, EVERY TIME I TAKE A FEW STEPS IN, IT'S LIKE SOMETHING'S FOLLOWING ME. JUST SOUNDED LIKE SOMETHING WAS, LIKE, AT THAT DOOR. DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS IN HERE. IS IT... I'M SURE THERE'S SOMETHING OVER HERE. ANY TIME MY HEAD JUST IMMEDIATELY STARTS HURTING DURING AN INVESTIGATION, I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE THERE HAS TO BE SOME TYPE OF SPIRIT AROUND, 'CAUSE I DON'T GET HEADACHES. WHATEVER IT WAS, I FEEL LIKE WALKED FROM HERE THROUGH HERE INTO HERE. THAT WEIRD, SKETCHY ENERGY IS DEFINITELY ACTIVE IN THIS ROOM. 'SUP, BLACK? GOOD, MAN? WHAT'S UP, BRO? HE A LITTLE DOWN-AND-OUT RIGHT NOW. NO, I'M NOT DOWN-AND-OUT. I'M JUST SAYING, LIKE, WE HAD A -- HE MAD 'CAUSE I OPENED UP A PORTAL IN HIS BEDROOM. DANG. DID Y'ALL CLOSE IT? YEAH. I THINK SO. I APOLOGIZE FOR WHATEVER PORTAL JUWAN OPENED UP IN YOUR ROOM. BUT, GUYS, IT IS GETTING LATE, MAN. WE MIGHT AS WELL GO AHEAD AND GO TO OUR ROOMS, MAN. I'M GONNA SLEEP IN THE LOBBY. HEY, WHATEVER -- WHATEVER YOU GOT TO DO, MAN. MAN, ALL MY STUFF IS IN MY ROOM. SHUCKS! SEE Y'ALL IN THE MORNING... - YOU ON THIS FLOOR? - NOPE. THIS ONE. - HEY, MARCUS, BE SAFE, BRO. - SHUT UP. JUWAN SAID HE THINKS HE CLOSED THE PORTAL. YOU THINK, BRO? AND I GOT TO GO SLEEP IN THERE NOW? THIS IS GONNA REALLY BE FUN, DAWG. WHAT THE HELL? JUWAN! DALEN! - YO, MAN! YO! - YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN? MAN, GET Y'ALL'S STUFF! LET'S GO, BRO! MARCUS? I'M NOT PLAYING WITH Y'ALL, BRO. BRO, WHERE YOU GOING? HEY, DAWG. MAN, WE GOT TO GO, BRO. - WE GOT TO GO, MAN. - WHY YOU SO LOUD, MAN? NO, NO. WE GOT TO GO. WHAT'S UP, MAN? YOU WOKE US UP WITH ALL YOUR YELLING. BRO, THE SCARIEST THING IN MY LIFE. WE GOT TO GO, MAN. CAN WE PLEASE LEAVE? WHY? WHAT HAPPENED, MAN? I WAS IN THE BED, NODDING OFF. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, I GOT TOUCHED BY SOMETHING. WHAT THE HELL? - YOU'RE LYING, BRO. - I LIE TO YOU NOT. I WAS WATCHING SPORTS, DOZING OFF. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, LIKE, SOMETHING TOUCHED ME LIKE THAT, DAWG. BRO, I'M READY TO GO. - CAN WE PLEASE LEAVE? - WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. I GOT TO GET OUT THIS HOTEL WHERE I GOT TOUCHED BY A GHOST. THAT MIGHT BE A NICE T-SHIRT. - WHAT ARE YOU WEARING, DAWG? - WHAT? WHY ARE YOU DRESSED LIKE THIS? YOU SLEEP LIKE THIS? I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO CHANGE, MAN. YOU WOKE US UP. THIS IS WHAT I SLEEP IN, BRO. IT'S COMFORTABLE. IN TIMS? ALL RIGHT. NOW THAT WE'RE UP, LET'S FINISH THIS INVESTIGATION. MARCUS BEING TOUCHED BY A GHOST JUST MAKES ME WANNA FURTHER INVESTIGATE THIS HOUSE. SO WE'RE GONNA TALK TO JACOB, WHO'S AN EXPERT ON POLLY BARCLAY, WHO'S ONE OF THE SPIRITS THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE IS STILL HAUNTING THIS HOTEL. SO, JACOB, WE HEAR YOU KNOW A LOT ABOUT POLLY BARCLAY. MAN, YOU GOT TO SHARE THE WEALTH. POLLY BARCLAY WAS A WOMAN FROM WASHINGTON THAT WAS TRIED, SENTENCED TO DEATH, AND ACTUALLY EXECUTED HERE IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA. THIS IS IN MAY OF 1806. WHAT WAS POLLY ACTUALLY EXECUTED FOR? SHE WAS FOUND GUILTY OF COMPLICITY FOR THE MURDER OF HER HUSBAND, JOHN BARCLAY. - OKAY. - AND AT THE TIME, A WOMAN BEING CONVICTED OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS WAS ALMOST UNHEARD OF. DO YOU FEEL LIKE SHE WAS GUILTY? I THINK SHE WAS INVOLVED, BUT I DON'T THINK SHE PULLED THE TRIGGER. BUT THE KICKER OF THE STORY IS THE JUDGE CARRIED OUT THE SENTENCE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT. WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE HOTEL ACTUALLY BEING BUILT ON A CEMETERY. DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE SHE WAS BURIED HERE? I THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBLE. BUT THERE'S NO RECORD OF WHERE HER GRAVE ACTUALLY IS. IN YOUR OWN OPINION, WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU COULD START TO TRY AND FIND THE MOST ACTIVITY FROM POLLY? I WOULD THINK THAT IN THE BALLROOM. ON THE DAY OF HER EXECUTION, SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A PARDON FROM THE GOVERNOR. SO SHE SHOWED UP FOR THE EXECUTION IN HER FINEST SILK BALL GOWN EXPECTING A PARDON. BUT THE PARDON NEVER CAME THROUGH. - WHAT IS ALL THAT NOISE? - WHAT WAS THAT? I THINK THAT MIGHT BE POLLY. AM I TRIPPING? NO. THAT'S JUST -- THAT'S JUST THE -- - WHAT IS IT? - FALSE ALARM. - WHERE YOU SEE STEVE AT? - I DON'T SEE STEVE. HE WENT BACK UPSTAIRS. STEVE. WHAT? STEVE IS OVER THERE. STEVE IS OVER THERE. SNAP. NO, THAT WAS NOT STEVE. REAL TALK. THAT WAS -- WAIT, HOLD UP A SECOND. NAH, THAT WALKED DOWN THE HALLWAY. WHAT'S GOING ON? WE HEARD FOOTSTEPS WALKING DOWN THE HALLWAY, SOMEBODY SHUFFLING DOWN THE HALLWAY. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS OUR PRODUCER STEVE. THERE IS NO WAY HE COULD'VE GOTTEN UP THE STAIRS AND RAN ACROSS THE -- THE THIRD FLOOR TO GET TO WHERE HE WAS WHEN HE RESPONDED TO US. BRO. YO, YO, YO, HOLD UP A SEC. HOLD UP A SEC. THERE WAS LITERALLY NOBODY UP HERE. AND WE'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN THIS HOTEL. - IT WAS A DRAG. - DRAGGING UP THE STAIRS. AND IT'S RIGHT OVER HERE, NEAR MY ROOM, OF COURSE, 307. OKAY, THAT'S -- THAT'S KINDA WEIRD TO ME. JACOB, MAN, WHAT YOU BRING WITH YOU, MAN? ALL THAT TALK ABOUT POLLY DONE STIRRED SOMETHING UP. - MAYBE IT IS HER. - DANG, MAN. - I GUESS I TALKED IT UP. - RIGHT. YEAH. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THAT INFORMATION, JACOB. I'M THINKING THAT THE FOOTSTEPS MAY HAVE BEEN POLLY'S WAY OF TRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH US. SINCE JACOB SAID POLLY WAS WEARING HER FINEST BALL GOWN ON THE DAY OF HER EXECUTION, WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA CHECK OUT THE BALLROOM. AND I GOT SOME IDEAS ABOUT WHAT WE CAN USE FOR BAIT. FELLAS. FELLAS, MAN. I'M GLAD WE'RE ACTUALLY OUTSIDE OF THE BALLROOM, MAN. IT'S TIME FOR ME TO BREAK OUT MY BIG IDEA. OKAY. WHAT'S UP? A SPIRIT CIRCLE. WAIT. WHAT'S A SPIRIT CIRCLE? ALL RIGHT, COOL. MAN, LISTEN. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO, MAN. WE'RE GONNA GET THESE PRINTED-OUT LETTERS, RIGHT, OF THE ALPHABET AND PUT 'EM IN A BIG CIRCLE. PUT SOME CANDLES OUT, MAN, GET A BOTTLE -- ALMOST LIKE SPIN THE BOTTLE -- AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GONNA ASK THE SPIRITS A QUESTION -- LIKE, WHO'S HAUNTING THE HOTEL? I'M NOT COOL WITH THAT, DAWG. YOU KNOW, I CAN ASK QUESTIONS. I CAN DO PRETTY MUCH ANY AND EVERYTHING Y'ALL WANNA DO. BUT, LIKE, WHEN IT COMES TO, LIKE, OPENING STUFF UP, MAN, I'M NOT REALLY COOL WITH THAT, DAWG. I THINK THAT, LIKE, AS LONG AS WE OPEN IT, AND THEN WE CLOSE IT, I THINK WE MAY BE OKAY. BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COMING OUT OF THAT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. I DON'T KNOW, MAN. I FEEL LIKE IT'S A PRETTY SOLID IDEA. I GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS SPIRIT CIRCLE. SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND SIT ON OUT. - BE SAFE, BROTHER. - GOOD LUCK. MAN. HEY, Y'ALL, BE SAFE. WE HAVE ALL THE LETTERS OF THE ALPHABET. WE HAVE DO THEY WANNA KNOW YEAH OR NAH.

NO. IT'S NOT, BRO. EITHER SIT DOWN OR STEP OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE, BRO -- EITHER/OR. WE BE KNEE TO KNEE. ALL RIGHT, BRO. IF THERE'S A SPIRIT IN THIS BALLROOM WITH US, USE THIS BOTTLE AS A DEVICE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US. IS THE SPIRIT OF POLLY BARCLAY IN THIS BALLROOM WITH US? YEAH. HELL. BRO, THAT STOPPED RIGHT AT YEAH. WHAT YOU THINK, BRO? KEEP GOING WITH THE GAME, BROTHER. DO YOU WANT US TO LEAVE? YEAH. BRO. WHERE YOU GOING? DON'T LEAVE ME IN HERE BY MYSELF. IF THERE'S A SPIRIT IN THIS BALLROOM WITH US, USE THIS BOTTLE AS A DEVICE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US. IS THE SPIRIT OF POLLY BARCLAY IN THIS BALLROOM WITH US? YEAH. HELL. BRO, THAT STOPPED RIGHT AT YEAH. JACOB SAID THE BALLROOM IS PROBABLY WHERE WE WOULD GET THE MOST ACTIVITY FROM POLLY. SO WE'RE GONNA USE A SPIRIT CIRCLE TO SEE IF POLLY WILL SPELL OUT A MESSAGE. DO YOU WANT US TO LEAVE? YEAH. YEAH. BRO, WHERE YOU GOING? DON'T LEAVE ME IN HERE BY MYSELF. BRO, WHERE YOU GOING? MARCUS, OVER. - BRO. - GOT YOUR ANSWERS. - GOT YOUR ANSWERS, DIDN'T YOU? - BRO. - BUT WITH THE FIRST 2 SPINS? - GOT YOUR ANSWERS, DIDN'T YOU? WHATEVER WE OPENED UP IN HERE, STAY IN THE BALLROOM. AND DO NOT COME WITH US. BLOW IT OUT. BLOW. GO, GO, GO, GO, BLOW, BLOW, BLOW, BLOW. ALL OF THEM. YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE WITH US. STAY IN THE BALLROOM. YOUR HOME IS THE HOTEL. MARCUS, OVER. WHY ISN'T THIS MAN PICKING UP THAT WALKIE, MAN? MAN, IF YOU DON'T CALM YOUR ASS DOWN... BRO, HOW DO YOU CLOSE THAT LITTLE PORTAL - YOU THINK YOU JUST OPENED? - ALREADY DID, BRO. I TOLD EVERY SPIRIT TO STAY IN THERE AND DON'T COME BACK WITH US. YOU'RE OKAY, BRO. Juwan, Dalen, y'all all right? NO. NO, WE'RE NOT ALL RIGHT, BRO. WE'VE BEEN CALLING YOU FOREVER. WHERE ARE YOU? I'm in the dining room, of the first floor. WE'LL BE THERE SHORTLY. MARCUS! BRO. TOLD Y'ALL, PLAYING WITH THAT STUFF, MAN -- NO, MAN. DID Y'ALL LEAVE THAT UP THERE, THOUGH? - LISTEN. - YEP. - WE HOPE HE LEFT IT UP THERE. - I TOLD IT TO STAY, BRO. IT TOLD US TO LEAVE. MARCUS, I'M TELLING YOU, BRO, I FELT WHERE YOUR APPREHENSION CAME FROM. - I TOLD YOU, MAN. - I GOT UP THERE. - I DIDN'T REALLY WANNA DO IT. - HEY, GUYS. WHATEVER. FIRST TWO QUESTIONS, HE SPINS THE BOTTLE. IT LANDS ON YES. OF COURSE, IF YOU TRY TO OPEN UP SOME TYPE OF COMMUNICATION WITH SPIRITS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DEFINITELY GONNA GET SOME RESULTS THAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GONNA GET. BUT CAN WE AT LEAST GIVE ME SOME COOL POINTS - 'CAUSE IT WORKED? - I CAN'T. I DON'T EVEN WANNA TOUCH YOU, BRO, 'CAUSE THAT MIGHT BE CONTAGIOUS. THE DUMB JUICE MIGHT BE CONTAGIOUS. MNH-MNH. WHATEVER, MAN. I FEEL SUCCESSFUL. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU THIS MUCH, DALEN. - WHAT'S UP? - I'M ON STRIKE. I'M ON STRIKE FROM THE REST OF YOUR DUMB IDEAS. OR HIS SURPRISES. HELL NO. I WON'T GO. HELL NO. I WON'T GO. BRO, BUT THEY ALWAYS WORK. HELL NO. I WON'T GO. WHILE DALEN AND JUWAN GO CHECK OUT THE BASEMENT, I'M GONNA GO INVESTIGATE THE DINING ROOM. I THINK I GOT THE PERFECT TRIGGER OBJECT, TOO. ALL RIGHT. SO THIS HOTEL IS BUILT ON A CEMETERY. SO WHY NOT GIVE THESE PEOPLE THEIR HEADSTONE BACK? WE DON'T KNOW WHO ALL WAS BURIED HERE. BUT AT LEAST IT WOULD KINDA GIVE, LIKE, SOME TYPE OF NICE GESTURE TO SHOW THAT, LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE RESPECT YOU FOR LIVING, AND WE RESPECT YOU IN YOUR DEATH. SO I THINK I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND RUN A EVP RECORDING SESSION JUST TO SEE WHO'S IN HERE. ARE THERE ANY SPIRITS FROM THE CEMETERY IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW? ARE THE FITZPATRICKS HERE IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW? Y'ALL DID HEAR THAT, RIGHT? WATCH YOUR STEP, BROTHER. SINCE THE BASEMENT IS THE CLOSEST ROOM TO WHERE THE BODIES ARE BURIED BENEATH THE HOTEL, JUWAN AND I ARE GONNA HEAD DOWNSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND. IS IT HEAVY? DAMN! BRO, COME ON, MAN. BY GOING DOWN THESE STAIRS, IT PUTS US LITERALLY ON WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CEMETERY. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO GO DOWN THERE. - BRO. - GO AHEAD, MAN. DO NOT LET ME GO DOWN HERE BY MYSELF, MAN. I GOT YOUR BACK. YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THE LIGHT? AND I'LL SHINE IT DOWN FOR YOU? NO 'CAUSE I NEED TO USE THE LIGHT SO I CAN SEE WHERE I'M GOING. OKAY. YOU KNOW IN THE SCARY MOVIES, BRO, WHEN THEY GO INTO THE BASEMENT, AND THERE'S ALWAYS, LIKE, THE WORST SPIRIT IN THE BASEMENT? THIS IS FOR SURE WHERE THAT HAPPENS AT. - THAT'S THAT MOMENT? - THIS IS THAT MOMENT FOR SURE. BLESS YOU. BLESS YOU. **** - BLESS YOU. - DAMN! EXCUSE ME. I'M FOLLOWING DALEN TO THE BASEMENT, AND SOMETHING JUST HITS ME. MY NOSE, MY EYES. I'M JUST HAVING A HARD TIME BREATHING. BRO, YOU ALL RIGHT? - MY GOD. - YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN? I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE EFFECTS OF A CEMETERY. WHOA, MAN. WHATEVER'S WRONG WITH YOU, YOU GOT TO STAY DOWN HERE WITH ME, BRO. **** WHOA. SO MANY COBWEBS, BRO. BRO, IF I STRETCH ANY FURTHER, THESE TIGHT PANTS ARE BEING RIPPED. BRO, THIS IS A PRETTY COOL PLACE TO DO A EVP SESSION, THOUGH, MAN. POLLY, ARE YOU BURIED UNDER THIS HOTEL? ARE THERE ANY SPIRITS DOWN HERE? RUN IT BACK. POLLY, ARE YOU BURIED UNDER THIS HOTEL? ARE THERE ANY SPIRITS DOWN HERE? WAIT. WAS THAT YOU? NO. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, TOO. - NO, YOU DON'T. - I DO. WATCH. I'LL TELL YOU WHERE IT'S AT. ARE THERE ANY SPIRITS DOWN HERE? RIGHT THERE. WAS THAT A YEAH? POLLY, ARE YOU BURIED UNDER THIS HOTEL? JUWAN AND I ARE DOING A EVP SESSION IN THE BASEMENT OF THE FITZPATRICK HOTEL. WE'RE PLAYING BACK OUR RECORDING TO SEE IF WE CAPTURED ANY EVIDENCE OF SPIRITS BEING HERE. POLLY, ARE YOU BURIED UNDER THIS HOTEL? ARE THERE ANY SPIRITS DOWN HERE? WAIT. WAS THAT YOU? NO. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, TOO. - NO, YOU DON'T. - I DO. WATCH. I'LL TELL YOU WHERE IT'S AT. ARE THERE ANY SPIRITS DOWN HERE? RIGHT THERE. WAS THAT A YEAH? ARE THERE ANY SPIRITS DOWN HERE? HE SAYS, "YEAH." COME ON, MAN. MAN, I CAN'T EVEN BE TRYING TO RUN DOWN HERE, HOMEY. IF SOMETHING WERE TO HAPPEN, I'D HAVE TO SIT RIGHT HERE AND TAKE IT. BRO, I FEEL SO VULNERABLE RIGHT NOW. - THIS IS HORRIBLE. - LISTEN TO THIS. AND THERE IS NO WAY OUT. ARE THERE ANY SPIRITS DOWN HERE? THAT WAS SO DEFINITIVE. I THINK WE NEED TO ASK WHO'S HERE. SPIRIT, YOU'VE ALREADY LET US KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE. PLEASE TELL US YOUR NAME. ARE YOU MRS. FITZPATRICK? IS IT YOU, POLLY BARCLAY? SPIRIT, YOU'VE ALREADY LET US KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE. PLEASE TELL US YOUR NAME. ARE YOU MRS. FITZPATRICK? IS IT YOU, POLLY BARCLAY? WHAT IS THAT NOISE? I FEEL LIKE WE REALLY -- YOU KNOW, WE GOT -- SOMETHING'S DOWN HERE. SOMETHING SAID, "YEAH." THERE'S NO IDEA TO HOW MANY SPIRITS REALLY ARE UNDER THIS HOTEL. BRO, YOU COULD LITERALLY BE STANDING ON SOMEONE'S GRAVE RIGHT NOW. WHAT IF THAT WAS A PERSON THAT WAS LIKE, "YEAH." WE JUST DID A EVP RECORDING SESSION. AND WE GOT A DEFINITIVE YES TO ASKING IT. AND THE CRAZY THING IS WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT SPIRIT IT IS. IT COULD BE POLLY. IT COULD BE MISS FITZPATRICK. AND WE STILL HAVE NO IDEA. IS GOING UP EASIER THAN COMING DOWN? NO. MAN, THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE CRAZIEST NIGHTS THAT I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED. I MEAN, WE'VE HAD CRAZY STUFF HAPPEN. MAN. I DID THE FLASHLIGHT EXPERIENCE. AND I GOT MISS FITZPATRICK TELLING ME THAT IT'S HER THAT'S IN THE CAFé. MISS FITZPATRICK, IS IT YOU THAT'S HERE? ALL RIGHT, OKAY. ALL RIGHT. I'VE HAD PROBABLY THE WORST OF ANYBODY IN THIS HOUSE. - HOW SO? - Y'ALL PUT ME IN 307, WHICH HAS THE MOST ACTIVITY. SO I'M PROBABLY GONNA GET TOUCHED WHILE I'M ASLEEP. WHAT THE HELL? IN THE BALLROOM WITH THE, YOU KNOW, THE SPIRIT CIRCLE, THAT CONFIRMED THAT SOMETHING WAS DOWN THERE. DO YOU WANT US TO LEAVE? YEAH. ALSO DID AN EVP RECORDING SESSION IN THE BASEMENT. DALEN ASKED ABOUT A SPIRIT. AND IT SAID, "YES." ARE THERE ANY SPIRITS DOWN HERE? RIGHT THERE. WAS THAT A YEAH? SO, MAN, I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT MISS FITZPATRICK AND POLLY BARCLAY ARE DEFINITELY TWO OF THE SPIRITS STILL HANGING AROUND, - BASED ON THAT EVIDENCE. - YEAH. BUT LOOK, MAN. IT'S BEEN GOOD. I FEEL LIKE WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF ANSWERED, MAN. IT MIGHT BE TIME TO GET UP OUT OF HERE, BRO. NOT "MAYBE." I'M ALREADY OUT. I'M ALREADY OUT. I'M ALREADY OUT. MARCUS, YOU GOT THE KEYS, BRO. OUR MISSION TONIGHT WAS TO FIND OUT WHAT SPIRITS STILL HAUNT THIS HISTORIC HOTEL. IN ADDITION TO MISS FITZPATRICK AND POLLY BARCLAY, WE BELIEVE THAT THERE DEFINITELY COULD BE OTHER SPIRITS HERE. WE CAN'T SAY FOR SURE IF THERE ARE SPIRITS FROM THE BODIES BURIED BENEATH THE HOTEL, A MURDERED MISTRESS OR OTHER FITZPATRICK FAMILY MEMBERS. BUT THIS HOTEL IS DEFINITELY HARBORING OTHER ENTITIES. Y'ALL BETTER HURRY UP AND GET IN THIS CAR, MAN. BRO, LET'S GET UP OUT OF HERE, MAN. YEAH, Y'ALL SPIRITS, Y'ALL CAN STAY HERE. - I AM GHOSTING OUT. - LET'S GO, Y'ALL.
