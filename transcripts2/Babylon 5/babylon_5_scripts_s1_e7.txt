 - The last poem you read. - "In the Light of Two Moons. " Did I not hear it when we were...? Both too young to know anything about anything. We could only feel and wonder what it all meant. But you recall correctly. I did start it then, poor and groping for meaning. It has matured and changed over the years. I finally knew it was ready. Tonight was its first performance. - I remember it. - I thought you might. Our lives were simpler then. Do you regret the choices that you made to be here?

 Sometimes. Only sometimes. You? I would be nothing other than what I am. - It's been a long day. - I have kept you too late. I have a performance in the morning and must prepare to go to Earth. I hope humans appreciate the spirit you bring. If they do not, I shall retire to a doxhouse... ...and devote my remaining years to the songs of Heefa. It is good to have you here, Mayan. - Shall I walk you to your quarters? - Thank you, dear friend. But I'm sure your day begins even earlier than mine. - Good night then. - Good night. Stay away from Earth, freak! It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind...

 ... 1 0 years after the Earth-Minbari War.  The Babylon Project was a dream given form.  Its goal: to prevent another war by creating a place...  ... where humans and aliens could work out their differences.  It's a port of call,  home away from home...  ... for diplomats, hustlers,  entrepreneurs and wanderers.  Humans and aliens,  wrapped in 2,500,000 tons...  ... of spinning metal,  all alone in the night.  It can be a dangerous place.  But it's our last,  best hope for peace.  This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations.  The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5. This is an outrage, commander! An outrage! Shaal Mayan is a cultural treasure of my people! This brutal attack affects not only her but the soul of my entire race! We'll get the attacker. Will that take away Mayan's pain, her terror, her humiliation? She refused my offer for an escort. She did not think anyone wished her harm. There was a time when one could walk through Green Sector without escorts! We're doing everything we can to correct that. Then you are required to do better, commander. Much better! This is the sixth attack on a prominent alien in two weeks. Earth and Mars have had a rash of similar incidents. - Home Guard? - That brand is their calling card. Their numbers are growing along with other pro-Earth groups. Pro-Earth? They're playing off fear to turn human against alien. But I won't have it on Babylon 5. - I want these scum, Michael. - I'll do my best. But there's many who agree with them, and even more who don't give a damn. Then make them give a damn! I've just been informed of the latest atrocity committed by your people. My people did not attack Shaal Mayan. Whoever did will be found and punished to the full extent of the law. I have no special love for the Minbari. But I warn you, if any Narn is harmed in this way, there'll be retribution! And I warn you, any disruption of Babylon 5 will be dealt with... ...even if I have to throw the entire Narn population into the brig. Now, if you'll excuse me. All I could see was a shadow. I'm sorry. This shadow, was it humanoid, alien, big, small? It was a shadow. That is all that I know. That, and the pain... ...and this. Is there anyone here who has reason to harm you? Mr. Garibaldi, I create and perform ti'la... ...poem songs that attempt to recall old memories and prompt new ideas. While a number of them have provoked discussions of some heat... ...I have never before been stabbed and branded. Thank you for your time. - I could remove that mark... - No. It is a lesson. One that should not be forgotten. Babylon Control to Centauri liner Carbo... ...we'll take custody of the detainees. - What kind? Raiders? Hijackers? - Unknown. He said they don't look dangerous and he wants to hand them over. - Lf you have a minute... - I don't. I'm up to my eyeballs with these attacks. - One minute. - I don't have one. Would you like me to get the commander to do it? - Okay, all right, I'll do it. - Good. Quick stop first. I found an illegal planter in the garden. Someone's using our hydroponic system to grow coffee. We all know the garden's only for fruits, vegetables, grains... ...so I figured I'd rip it out of the planter. It's too bad. The beans looked ripe and coffee is so expensive to import. I'm taking a walk, so I might as well pick up the detainees. You're vicious. I'm head of security. It's in the job description. Let go! I am a Centauri citizen. You have no right to manhandle me. We demand to see Ambassador Cotto! Lead them to Blue 5 and inform the Centauri representative. Susan. It's been a long time. It's been eight years, Malcolm. What are you doing here? I'm looking for something. Something I never stopped wanting. - I have to go. I have duties. - Same old Susan. Duty first. That's right. Enjoy your stay. - But you wrote that you were ambassador. - It's difficult to explain right now. This is a great disappointment, cousin. All right, Sinclair, what is it this time? - I suggest you ask Ambassador Cotto. - Who? Ambassador Mollari, may I present Aria Tensus and my cousin, Kiron Maray. They arrived from Centauri Prime... ...and were taken into custody by Earthforce security! Can you explain this affront to our noble citizens? Your noble citizens had stolen credit chips. Oh, I see. I'll release them into your custody pending further investigation. What am I supposed to do? You're always saying the Centauri are an advanced race. You figure it out. So you do take a break every now and then. - Actually, my shift just ended. - Then maybe we can talk. There was a time when you and I would spend entire evenings... ...just talking, when we weren't... . That was a long time ago, Malcolm. A different place, a different me. All the more reason to start over. - I'm tired. I have to go. - Susan. It's been eight years. Let's take it slow, all right? So when marriages were arranged for them, they fled here. Yes, but why? I'm to marry the ugliest woman on Centauri Prime. She is to marry a man as old as her grandfather! Ugly and old, yes? Then their families must be rich and powerful. Your parents made fine choices. I still don't see the problem! - We don't want to marry anyone else! - We want to marry each other. - We love each other. - Love?! What does love have to do with marriage?! My dear, beautiful children. Consider for a moment what you are doing. For a thousand years, marriages have been arranged among our people. Marriages which meld the noble houses together... ...and keep the fabric of the Republic strong. Sometimes, these marriages call for sacrifice. Great sacrifice. But we make this sacrifice... ...because this is what it means to be Centauri! If you deny this tradition, you lose the very thing... ...which makes you what you are. Do you understand? But it's so unfair! Are you aware of the regulations regarding weapons? I got a right to defend myself! You've seen the things around here. - They could tear a man's head off! - Were you doing that the other night? What do you mean? Mayan was attacked. There's fresh blood on your knife. It's mine. I cut myself opening a crate. - Ever hear of the Home Guard? - Yeah, sure. They got the right idea. It's about time we humans stood up for our rights! Damn aliens are ruining everything for us! Book him for the weapon and run a DNA check on that blood. - What the hell is this crap?! - I don't like your attitude. If the blood matches, I'll give you over to the Minbari and let them play! I don't know what's worse: Damn aliens or the traitors who suck up to them! Get him out of here! Earth Alliance transport,  proceed to jumpgate.  Roger, Babylon Control.  Ambassador Kosh, I thought I'd make sure you'd been informed. There have been attacks on non-humanoids. We're thoroughly investigating it and hope to wrap it up soon. Good. Meanwhile, it might be helpful if you spoke with the other ambassadors. We take no interest in the affairs of others. I hope you'll reconsider. If you could give us a hand, we... Yes? Nothing. We'll respect your wishes. That's quite a viewer. I've never seen anything quite like it before. - What is it? - Efficient. Those are images from my world. If I may ask, what are you...? - I am studying. - Studying what? Ambassador? - Any word from Earth Central? - No. There's something I've been thinking about all day. I can't forget it. What's that? Were you briefed on what happened when Ambassador Kosh arrived? A radical Minbari organization tried to kill him. He was poisoned through the hand. Talking with Kosh, I remembered something I never figured out. His suit protects him from our atmosphere, so how'd he get poisoned? His hand should've been covered. Vorlons are secretive. And they hide what they look like, how their biology works. Who knows if the suit is necessary or if it camouflages what's inside? The only person who knows is Dr. Ben Kyle, who saved Kosh's life. Bound by oath of confidentiality... ...he never told me what he saw inside the encounter suit. Right after that, he was transferred to Earth to work with the president. Lyta Alexander, the only Psi Corps member to scan a Vorlon... ...was transferred back. - You think there's a connection? - I don't know. Maybe. Do you know how much trouble these lovebirds have given me? I have a dozen messages from Centauri Prime. The families are outraged and are after my head! - What will you do? - What will I do? Send them home where they belong and hope they come to their senses! - But they love each other. - Love. Overrated! Here, look. These are my three wives: Pestilence, famine and death. Did I marry them for their personalities? Their personalities could shatter entire planets. Arranged marriages, every one. But they worked out. They inspired me. Knowing that they were waiting at home for me keeps me here. Seventy-five light-years away. - They're just going to run away again. - Happily, that's not my problem. Now, you go find your little lovebirds and tell them to be ready. A transport is leaving for Centauri Prime tonight and I want them on it. If you need me, I'll be in the Casino. Commander. The Abbai delegation is docking. Have a liaison officer meet them at customs. - You wanted to see me? - You have a suspect in Mayan's assault? Had. DNA scan showed the blood on his knife was his. He fit the profile, though. A hate freak. - You let him go? - Under surveillance. He's more useful running loose. He's a logical recruit for the Home Guard. Good. What else have you found? I haven't had time. There's been fights all over the station. - Things are getting ugly. - That's what they want. If Babylon 5 becomes a war zone, all we've worked for will be destroyed. - We better wrap this one up quickly. - I know. We had some good times together. Yeah, we sure did. Tell me, do you... . Do you ever regret leaving me? Regret? No. Io was a great career move. It opened a lot of doors... ...and serving there was very exciting for me... ...even if I cried myself to sleep the first few months. I never wanted to let you go. I feel the same today. I'm still committed to my career. And you know what that means. And I can accept that now. Which is why I'm going into business here. What? This is the first time I've ever surprised you. - But you're not serious, are you? - Absolutely. In fact, I've already secured an office and quarters. All I need is a few more clients. I hope you might help me with that. But the important thing is that we'll be together again. Right? Kiron! Aria! Let's get out of here! Kiron. He's in a coma. Thoracic wound, PPG at close range. - He's in Intensive Care in Medlab 2. - How's Aria? Stunned with a shock stick. Scared. Physically, she'll be fine. - Does she remember anything? - No. And the boy? He may be able to identify his attacker if he wakes up. Chief, we have a disturbance in Central Corridor, Brown Sector.  We can no longer stand idly by... ...as our peoples are slaughtered by cowardly humans! We must fight back with every means at our disposal! He's right! - Is there a problem, Ambassador G'Kar? - Problem, indeed! Eight non-humans brutally attacked in the space of two weeks... ...and you have yet to make even a single arrest! - We have a lead in the last incident... - Spare us the usual platitudes. You know very well why these crimes remain unsolved. It is because the perpetrators are human! - I want you out of here now! - Not until they listen. Anything you say will only make them hotter. Get out of here and let me do my job. I promise I'll be gentle. So this is your response, Sinclair? So much for Babylon 5's highly vaunted justice! Justice, you'll taste firsthand. I'll charge you with inciting to riot. Or you can leave and we'll call it a misunderstanding. Che duga. You. You, I hear. - You one who hunts. - Out of my way! Thank you. I had a lovely evening. Well, I was hoping that it wasn't over. Yet. - That's not too flattering. - It's duty. Ivanova here. -We've had a near riot. I need you.  -I'm on my way.  - You have to go. - A riot? Malcolm, out! - Catch you on your next break? - Yes. It's cooled down. But we've had a few incidents, one involving Roberts. How serious? He's in Medlab. We had him on surveillance. We nabbed the perps. Keep it quiet. This could provoke more trouble. I could strangle that G'Kar. Love your new look. I'd think you'd have something else on your mind. - Sir? - Let's begin. Aria. - I'm so sorry. - My dear child, don't worry. Kiron will be fine. Dr. Franklin is a veritable wizard. - They won't let me near him. - Of course not. But he wouldn't want that. If he senses I'm here, he'll recover. I know it. - Can't you do something? - Go back and rest. - There's nothing you can do here. - I'm not leaving Kiron. Ambassador. You should listen to her. We Minbari consider love a potent force for healing. She cares deeply for him. Such feelings can turn the tide when all else fails. Oh, I see. And if he dies despite this great power of love... If he dies, she will suffer enormous grief. But every moment together will lessen it. I would expect such logic from a poet. What can a Minbari know about Centauri feeling? I have traveled far and seen much. What I've seen tells me all sentient beings are best defined... ...by their capacity and their need for love. And she will learn to live without it! As you did? - You wanted to see me? - Roberts had an interesting visitor. Computer, play surveillance tape 91 7, count 1 6. Commencing.  I know that man. He was in lvanova's quarters last night. Mr. Roberts? I'm Malcolm Biggs.  What's happened to you is...  Well, it's a disgrace.  Tell me about it.  There are some of us who don 't like what's happening here.  Alien ambassadors setting policy for humans.  Alien workers taking jobs from humans.  Inhuman criminals preying...  ... on decent people like yourself.  We want to put a stop to that.  And we think you can help us.  End of recording.  I never would've dreamed... . A man can change a lot in 8 years. There's no reason you should've known. What is it you wanted me to do? Introduce me. Say I'm unhappy with aliens forcing themselves on Earth. Groups like this like to recruit friends in high places. If they accept me, we may be able to nail them before they do more damage. Very well. - On one condition. - Name it. I wanna be there when you take them down. There's a diplomatic reception tonight. That might be a good way to start. As you wish. - I've been looking everywhere for you. - Yes, what do you want? - To tell you something. - Well? - You were wrong. - What? Kiron and Aria wanna be together because they love each other. Would that destroy the Centauri Republic? - We cannot turn our back on tradition. - Damn tradition! Kiron may die because our glorious tradition... ...values wealth and power over love. My shoes are too tight. Excuse me? Something my father said. He was... ...old. Very old at the time. I went into his room... ...and he was sitting alone in the dark, crying. So I asked him what was wrong. And he said: "My shoes are too tight. But it doesn't matter... ...because I have forgotten how to dance. " I never understood what that meant until now. My shoes are too tight... ...and I have forgotten how to dance. I don't understand. Nor should you. Commander Sinclair. May I introduce Mila Shar... ...head of the agricultural delegation from Abba Four. We look forward to studying your hydroponic cultivation methods. - I hear they're most successful. - They should be. The best technos from Earth set it up. It's state of the art. - Your security is equally efficient? - Absolutely. We understand there have been attacks on non-humans lately. I'm concerned about our delegates. Don't be. Everything is under control. But wasn't a Centauri youth seriously injured just last night? He'll recover. - They're nervous. - About what? The recent attacks. They're afraid they're next. What if they are? On the Line, we had a motto: "The only good alien is a dead alien. " True then, true now. The job description says I must play diplomat. I don't have to like it. - Were you in the war? - No, I missed it. Sit down. Let me tell you something. I fought. My best friends died... ...and we won. Not because we out-fought them. Not because we were luckier, stronger or smarter. We won because the damn Minbari let us win. You know what that victory tasted like? Ashes. You'd be surprised how many times I've heard that. There's a movement back on Earth. It's growing, gaining in support from people just like you. So I've heard. We want to put Earth back at the center of the universe. Our universe. Get rid of alien influences! Get rid of aliens! Put Earth first! We must get back to our roots. Let's let humans be humans! Who's we? Friends of mine. And perhaps soon of yours. I want you to meet them. Both of you. I'd like that. Yes. Of course, we must be discreet. Not everyone agrees with us. So I'd like a small gesture. To show where your sentiments lie. What sort of gesture? Something to put every alien on this station in their place. To Earth! I know you're concerned about the violence onboard. There is no longer any danger. Good! You've arrested the criminals! Why weren't we informed? Mr. Garibaldi. We have good reason to believe the perpetrators fled to Earth. - You identified them? - That information is classified. - Why is it classified? - Do you think we are pouchlings? Are we to believe that they are simply gone? - I do not accept a word of it! - Neither do I! Believe what you like. The fact is the investigation is over! Thank you. Dr. Franklin! Welcome back. How do you feel? Tired. Well, that'll pass. When you're up to it, Mr. Garibaldi has some questions. And Ambassador Mollari wants to have a long talk with both of you. -Malcolm set the meeting.  - Where is it? He won 't tell me. He'll meet us and take us there. We're to be unarmed.  - He's cagey. - I expected that. You can monitor us. If they suspect us, this could be a trap. I'll be all ears. You need us, we're there. Good luck. You'll be able to travel in a few days. I've made arrangements. - But... - No more arguments. You will return to Centauri Prime as is your duty! However, upon arrival... ...you'll be met by Andilo Mollari, my second cousin. He will escort you to his estate in the capital... ...where you will enter a period of fosterage until you are adults. - I don't understand. - Fosterage? A common practice in the old days. Seldom done nowadays, the law still allows it. Vir, very impressive. I can see you've been studying. You will live with Andilo and his wives. They will instruct you in proper decorum for Centauris of your rank. Our parents will object. I doubt it. You see, Andilo is a very powerful man. It is a great honor to be fostered by him. To object would be to defy all tradition. What will become of us? You will study our culture, learning all you can. When you are old enough, Andilo will let you decide for yourselves... ...whom you wish to marry! Even if it's only for love? - Lf you insist! - Thank you. All right, enough. You two need to rest. Now, we'll talk more later. Ambassador. Why? Because. You are still children. And children should be allowed to dance. Vir. They're entering Cargo Bay 5. This is it. Where are the others? Already here, commander. Worth, activate the jammer. Alvarez, on scan. - We don't want to be disturbed. - I'm impressed. What are those things? Black-light camouflage, developed by Earthforce. They're still under wraps in R and D, but our friends got us prototypes. We have friends everywhere. We hope you'll be one of them. - I'll help any way I can. - We're counting on it. - Worth, is the jammer up? - Perimeter secured. Damn! They jammed us. Let's move. The recent attacks on Earth, Mars and here were just a prelude. In two days' time, there'll be a mass assassination. In one night, we'll take out the four major ambassadors stationed here. Mollari, Delenn, G'Kar and Kosh. Their deaths will be a signal to terminate the ambassadors on Earth. But the scale of it. You'd need hundreds of people. As he said, we got friends everywhere. Clear it out, clear it out! Coming through, coming through! What do you want us to do? Get us into the ambassadorial wing... ...and off the station undetected after we've finished. - No problem. - Good. Then there's just one more thing. I call it a little loyalty test. Commander, please! - I don't know what these men... - Shut up! - Kill it. - No, please. No! Please! Come on, you said it yourself. The only good alien is a dead one! Have mercy on me, commander, please. Malcolm. The scanner shows a whole lot of people heading our way. Move it out. Clear it. I wouldn't. Give me an excuse and you're dead. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Earth Alliance Special Transport is now departing from Docking Bay 6A.  All assigned personnel,  please report immediately.  Such great hatred for so little real reason. It seems incomprehensible to me. Human ways are often unfathomable. But one learns to live with them. If one has an exceedingly strong constitution. I can't believe you did this to me, Susan. What kind of a human are you to side with them? I find many of them are more human than you and your kind. You wouldn't understand. - I don't know you anymore. - I never knew you.
