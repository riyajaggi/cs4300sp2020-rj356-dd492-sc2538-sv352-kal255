 Watch Cmdr. Ayla reporting for duty.
 You're relieved.
 Wait. Picking up disturbance.
Trying to get a fix.
 Jump point forming in Sector 3.
 Great Maker.
 Activating mines!
 - Notify Centauri Prime.
- Fire, fire!
 Tell them we're under attack.
Tell them it's the...
 Garibaldi, have you seen
the commander? He's not responding.
 - He's in the Observation Dome.
- How do you know?
 He only turns off his link
10 minutes a day.
 When he does, that's where he is.
 But why? There's no traffic due.
No one's there.
 Exactly.
 Mr. Garibaldi.
 Oh, boy.
 Commander, there's a problem.
 - All I'm asking is that you trust me.
- Trust you?
 My brain will be five days dead
before I trust a Centauri.
 The first time we met you,
another civilization...
 ...you said you ran the entire galaxy.
What was it you said? "A huge empire."
 - Public relations.
- That hasn't been true for 100 years.
 Then you say Earth is a lost Centauri
tribe, making us distant relatives.
 Until we got some Centauri DNA,
and find out we're not related at all.
 - We're completely different species.
- A clerical error.
 - Clerical error?
- Yes.
 We thought your world was Beta 9.
It was actually Beta 12.
 We made a mistake. I'm sorry.
Here, open my wrists.
 Centauri don't have arteries
in their wrists.
 Of course not. Think I'm stupid?
 Do you know what your problem is?
You're not a people person.
 Ambassador!
 Have you met my diplomatic staff?
 Just arrived from the Homeworld.
This is it.
 - Ambassador?
- Yes, Vir, what is it?
 Our colony, Ragesh 3,
our agricultural colony?
 I know what it is. What about it?
 It's under attack.
No provocation, no warning.
 They got through the minefields.
They're firing on anything.
 Fighters. Wave after wave.
 - Who launched the attack?
- No one knows.
 It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind...
 ...10 years after
the Earth-Minbari War.
 The Babylon Project
was a dream given form.
 Its goal: to prevent another war
by creating a place...
 ...where humans and aliens
could work out their differences.
 It's a port of call,
home away from home...
 ...for diplomats, hustlers,
entrepreneurs and wanderers.
 Humans and aliens,
wrapped in 2,500,000 tons...
 ...of spinning metal,
all alone in the night.
 It can be a dangerous place.
 But it's our last,
best hope for peace.
 This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.
 The year is 2258.
 The name of the place is Babylon 5.
 Commander Sinclair, as the representative
of the Centauri Republic...
 ...I demand to know what information
your government has about Ragesh 3.
 We don't know any more.
We only know it was attacked.
 - What did Centauri Prime say?
- Nothing. I sent three messages.
 No answer. No one is talking.
 Ambassador, I just heard.
 You have my sincere condolences
for your losses.
 - You know nothing about this attack?
- I'm as astonished as you are.
 - Tell us about the colony.
- There's nothing to tell.
 It's an agricultural base. Civilian,
5000 colonists, practically unarmed.
 Let's see what our governments know.
 We'll call a session of the council
and the League of Non-Aligned Worlds.
 What's up?
 I'm picking up
a long-range distress signal.
 I was afraid
it was related to Ragesh 3...
 ...but it's an Earth-registered ship.
The signal mentioned Raiders.
 I knew they'd be back.
I'll check it out. Tell...
 We just lost the signal.
 Damn!
 - Lt. Commander lvanova?
- Yes?
 Talia Winters, licensed telepath.
Psi Corps rating P5.
 I was assigned a few weeks ago.
 Tell Fighter Jax to stand by.
I want those ships ready to go.
 I have to log in
with the second in command.
 I've tried to reach you, but you were
busy. I'm trying the direct approach.
 Your diligence is commendable.
Anything else?
 No, l...
 Then excuse me.
I'm in the middle of 15 things.
 Thank you for coming by.
 Delta 7, once we're in range, stay
close until we know what's going on.
 Confirmed.
 The race between incumbent Earth
Alliance President Luis Santiago...
 ...and challenger Marie Crane
tightens as election day nears.
 Polls give Santiago...
 Commander?
 a five-point advantage over Crane.
 Fade. Lieutenant commander?
 Was there any word from Earth Central
on the Centauri problem?
 No, and that worries me.
 They've had plenty of time,
but so far, nothing.
 Who do you think attacked?
The Narns? The Minbari?
 Not the Minbari. They're too honorable
to pull something like this.
 I'm surprised you
describe them that way.
 - You fought them during the war.
- Well, my father always said...
 ...the best way to understand
someone is to fight him.
 That's when you see the real person.
 Was he also a pilot?
 The best.
 The Sinclairs have been pilots
since the Battle of Britain.
 He taught me everything I know
about flying. And combat.
 He said to ignore the propaganda,
focus on what you see.
 I've never seen
the Minbari fight dishonorably.
 - They'd never pull a sneak attack.
- Perhaps.
 Any word yet on the election?
 It's gonna be close.
So, who are you voting for?
 I think I'll vote for Marie Crane.
 I do not like Santiago.
A leader should have a strong chin.
 He has no chin,
and his vice president has several.
 This, to me, is not
a good combination.
 - Ambassador!
- Vir?
 There's a coded signal
coming from Homeworld.
 A relay from the monitoring
station from Ragesh 3.
 All right, let's see.
 Jump point forming in Sector 3.
 - Great Maker.
- Activating mines!
 - All computers are down.
- Notify Centauri Prime.
 - Who would do this? Why?
- We're under attack. It's the...
 Reverse image. Hold.
 Enhance.
 That is a Narn heavy fighter.
 That bastard G'Kar. He said
he knew nothing of this. G'Kar!
 There she is.
 Stripped to the bone. Life signs?
 Negative. No survivors.
 - Check out the blast damage.
- Roger.
 They had something bigger
than standard guns.
 We're talking major weaponry here.
I don't like it.
 - Find the black box and return to base.
- Roger.
 Ambassador Mollari, please join me.
Would you like some spoo? It's fresh.
 Fresh, is it?
 You bastard. You won't get away
with this. We'll strike back hard.
 I assume you're referring
to our attack on Ragesh 3.
 I just found out. I'm sure
there's a reasonable explanation.
 What reasonably explains
the slaughter of unarmed civilians?
 We wondered that
when you invaded our world.
 The wheel turns, does it not?
 We should have wiped you out
when we had the chance.
 Run out of small children to butcher?
 You pig. Animal!
 Let him go!
If he wants to die, let him.
 Listen, ambassador,
your time has come and gone!
 It's our turn. One night you'll awaken
and find our teeth at your throat.
 Sleep well, ambassador.
Sleep lightly.
 I apologize for the incident
with G'Kar, commander.
 It was a mistake.
I will not repeat it.
 I will kill him, though.
Sooner or later. Somewhere.
 My people, we have a way, you see.
 We know how, and sometimes
even when, we are going to die.
 Comes in a dream.
 In my dream, I am an old man.
It's 20 years from now, and I am dying.
 My hands wrapped around someone's
throat, and his around mine.
 We have squeezed the life
out of each other.
 The first time I saw G'Kar...
 ...I recognized him as the one
from the dream. It will happen.
 In 20 years, we will die with our hands
around each other's throats.
 Twenty years is long enough for you
to come to an understanding.
 Believe as you wish.
 Twenty years from now,
one of us will be wiser and older.
 Or one of us will be dead.
Who's to say?
 Me, I need another drink.
 I think we can form a coalition
against the Narn attack.
 Good. The Narns have to be stopped.
Now, while we still can.
 Carn would want me to....
 Carn.
 Carn is my nephew. He wanted
to enter the Centauri military.
 I told him it was a waste
of his skills.
 The truth is, I was afraid for him.
 I wanted him someplace safe.
 Away from all of this.
 So I personally arranged for him
to have a higher position...
 as head researcher on Ragesh 3.
 Tonight, I don't know
if he's alive or dead.
 I'm sorry.
 I know this is hard for you.
 But if this turns into war,
you'll give the Narns what they want.
 A chance to divide us
so they can move in.
 There are other ways.
 Babylon 5 is here
to help keep the peace.
 Commander, please.
 On the issue of galactic peace...
 ...I am long past innocence
and fast approaching apathy.
 It's all a game,
a paper fantasy of names and borders.
 Only one thing matters, commander.
Blood.
 It calls out for blood.
 If Carn is dead, there will be war.
 Today, tomorrow, the day after,
it doesn't matter.
 If it's the last thing I do,
if it's the last breath I take...
 there will be war.
 This, I swear to you, commander.
This, I swear.
 You eat like a starving man.
 Seeing death does that to me.
There were 15 bodies on that ship.
 What's going on? We've got war
on Ragesh 3, pirates over here.
 The universe is going to hell.
You fill in the commander?
 Yes. It's the third time in a month
Raiders hit a ship here.
 - They're bolder.
- And more powerful.
 The weapons they used are bigger
than any they've used before.
 - Any idea where they'll hit next?
- Not yet.
 Transport routes are kept
secret to avoid attacks.
 - Sounds like there's a leak.
- I'm checking.
 Good. Keep me informed.
 Ambassador Kosh, Commander Sinclair.
Can I see you?
 Greetings, commander.
 You weren't at the council.
 I wanted to make sure you knew
about the emergency session.
 Yes.
 We may need help
to push through sanctions.
 Does your government have a position
on the current situation?
 Will you attend the emergency meeting?
 Yes.
 They are alone.
 They are a dying people.
We should let them pass.
 Who? The Narn or the Centauri?
 Yes.
 Mr. Garibaldi.
 You're sitting at my station,
using my equipment.
 Is there a reason, or should I just
snap your hands off at the wrists?
 Ships log their flight paths
through your console.
 I want to see which company sold
the routes to those supply ships.
 - Do you have any leads?
- Possible. Possible.
 - Ambassador?
- What do you want?
 The council meeting.
The emergency session.
 The council can go to hell, and
the emergency session can go to hell.
 And you, you can go to hell too.
 I wouldn't want you to feel left out.
 Londo.
 Londo, why are you doing this?
 Because we are a race
of lunatics and cowards.
 I finally received word
from our glorious leaders.
 Do you know what that convention
of genetic defectives...
 ...have decided to do
about the attack on Ragesh 3?
 - Probably they'll...
- After full consideration...
 ...of the situation,
the great Centauri Republic...
 the lion of the galaxy...
 will do nothing.
 Why?
 Because Ragesh 3 is too far,
too small, too unimportant...
 to risk a confrontation.
 And besides, by the time
our ships got there....
 Besides, by the time
our ships got there...
 everyone would be dead anyways.
 So....
 No, Londo, please. No.
 Damn all of them!
 Does that mean we cancel
the council meeting?
 No, listen to me.
You will not repeat a word of this.
 We have heard nothing.
Is that clear?
 If we get others to step in...
 ...perhaps we can embarrass the idiots
back home into action. Understand?
 If they find out we lied,
we're in trouble.
 Do you understand?
 Absolutely, absolutely understand.
 - Destination?
- Blue 14.
 Mr. Garibaldi,
may I ask you a question?
 I've tried twice to talk
to Lt. Commander lvanova...
 ...and I don't know if it's me or her,
but I can't get through.
 I can't imagine what it is
I've done to upset her.
 Unlike me, she takes time to warm up,
especially when she's working.
 When she gets off duty at 1800,
she stops by the casino to wind down.
 That might be a good time
to talk to her.
 All right, I'll try it. Thanks.
 Afterward, if you like,
you can stop by my quarters...
 ...and I can show you
my favorite thing in the universe.
 Okay, okay, my second
favorite thing in the universe.
 I see we have similar habits.
 Before going into battle, I also need
to walk in the green for a moment.
 We've recently managed
to restore a few forests on my world.
 It was all green, of course,
before the Centauri stripped it bare.
 And now you plan to return the favor.
 Is that it?
 I look forward to the day we've
cleansed the universe of Centauri...
 ...and carve their bones
into little flutes for Narn children.
 It is a dream I have.
 Be careful. Not every dream
I've heard lately ends well for you.
 In our position,
you would do the same.
 Our two worlds, our two species
are more alike than you might think.
 We were one of the few who would
supply the weapons you needed...
 in your war with the Minbari.
 We supported you. You owe us.
 Not a chance.
You didn't support anyone.
 Narns sell to anyone
who can afford the credits.
 But I'll give you points on one thing.
We're alike in one respect.
 We have experience
with sneak attacks.
 Pearl Harbor, the nuking of San Diego,
the destruction of our Mars colony.
 It's a long and bloody history.
 Know what we learned? The sneak
attack is the first resort of a coward.
 - Just a minute.
- You didn't pick a military target.
 A poorly-armed civilian colony.
 What a challenge that must
have been to the Narn military.
 What's wrong, ambassador?
Don't have the guts for a fair fight?
 In another place, I would have you
skinned alive for saying that.
 You want me,
you know where to find me.
 See you in council, ambassador.
 Commander, we got trouble.
I worked out how the Raiders operate.
 Shipping companies buy
jumpgate access, then sell it.
 One company sold routes
for the ships that were hit.
 Their data crystals blew last month.
Flatlined the system.
 - Someone cracked their data bank.
- Exactly.
 One ship hasn't been attacked.
 They'll hit it in six hours
when it leaves hyperspace.
 - Not much time.
- No, but here's the tough part.
 It's a supply vessel, but it got
booked by a refugee export service.
 There are 500 men, women
and children on that ship.
 If the Raiders get there
before we do, they're dead.
 You have got the entire Senate up in
arms. You've exceeded your authority.
 If we don't stop the Narn,
they'll keep coming.
 We must get the council
to authorize military intervention.
 I am asking you again
to delay the vote.
 And I'd like to see you
when I talk to you.
 Do you realize we've got an election
in less than 24 hours?
 - Colonists are dying there.
- That's not the issue.
 We just came out of one war.
Are you trying to start another?
 The Earth Alliance isn 't the galaxy's
policeman. Let them fight.
 Keep us out of it until the election.
 If you can 't postpone the meeting, I
am authorized by the subcommittee...
 to tell you to abstain.
 Earth has to take a neutral position.
 But that will damage
the Centauri case.
 If we pull out,
others might do the same.
 Not our problem. Those are your
instructions. This discussion is over.
 Just an update. Delta flight is ready
to intercept the Raiders.
 I hope they're well-armed. Garibaldi
says the Raiders have big guns and....
 Commander?
 That might be it. Tell Garibaldi
I'm taking his place.
 - Should I postpone the meeting?
- No. If I'm there...
 ...I'll have to do something
I don't want to.
 You can take my place on the council.
 It's all on the agenda.
Just take the vote.
 Any other instructions, commander?
 Lots. Unfortunately,
I couldn't find you before I left...
 ...so you never heard
Earth Central's orders.
 The last you heard, we were
voting for sanctions. Clear?
 Yes, sir. Clear as crystal.
 Preparing for jump. Stay in formation
when we come out the other side.
 Delta 7, you're my wingman.
 Confirmed, Delta leader.
 This meeting of the council...
 ...and the League of Non-Aligned
Worlds is called to order.
 We are voting on sanctions
against the Narn regime.
 Our options include
planetary blockade...
 If it please the council....
 I'll remind the council that before
the Centauri invaded our sector...
 ...and began their 100-year reign of
terror, Ragesh 3 was a Narn colony.
 Now that we are free,
it is our right to reclaim it.
 We recognize the prior claim.
 The reality is that Ragesh 3 has been
Centauri property for over a century.
 To start a war over blood
spilled so long ago....
 Where does it end?
 You kill them, take their land,
they kill you and take it back.
 On and on and on.
A cycle of hatred.
 Justice, not hatred.
We have no desire to start a war.
 All right, check instrumentation.
Keep scanning on all frequencies.
 This is the last transfer point.
 If the Raiders will hit anywhere,
this is it.
 Confirmed lock.
 High-energy weapons discharge noted
at coordinates 520 by 16 by 92.
 Locking on.
 Magnifying. Confirm sighting.
 Full thrusters. Maintain formation
until contact, then break and attack.
 Our forces came for the peaceful
liberation of Ragesh 3.
 We did not fire first,
and I can prove it.
 I direct your attention
to the monitors.
 We are about to receive
a live broadcast from Ragesh 3.
 I believe it may clarify the debate.
 My name is Carn Mollari.
 I am head researcher and project
director for the Ragesh 3 colony.
 The nephew, I add, of our own
esteemed Ambassador Londo Mollari.
 In the last six months,
there has been violence...
 ...created by division
among colonists.
 We asked for help from Centauri Prime.
There was no reply.
 Faced with chaos and anarchy,
the Ragesh 3 Administrative Council...
 ...asked for assistance
from the neighboring Narn regime.
 That's not true.
 We have chosen of our own free will...
 ...to ally ourselves
with the Narn government.
 We will, of course, maintain social
and economic ties to Homeworld...
 in the interest of continued peace.
 This is Carn Mollari, Ragesh 3...
 signing off.
 Don't you understand? Can't you see
what they're trying to do?
 They forced him
to read that statement.
 They threatened to kill him.
It's a lie!
 If you want to talk about lies,
what about your lie of omission?
 Didn't your world vote against taking
action in response to the liberation?
 - Yes, but...
- Then why ask us to take actions...
 ...that even your own government
considers inappropriate?
 This council should not be used to
carry out your own personal vendettas.
 I move that this council vote...
 ...to dismiss all charges
against the Narn regime.
 Is there a second?
 Please call the vote.
 This is Commander Sinclair of Babylon 5
to raiding party.
 Surrender your vessels
or be destroyed.
 Repeat, surrender or be destroyed.
 I assume I can take that as a no.
 And cut velocity...
 now.
 Delta leader, Raiders are breaking
off. Do we pursue and attack?
 No. The cruiser's hit.
We can't leave it.
 Deltas 2 through 6 plus 8,
escort her back to base.
 - Deltas 7 and 9, with me.
- Roger, Delta leader.
 Activate long-range scanners,
wideband search for transmissions.
 The Raiders went
in the opposite direction.
 Which is what I'd do to decoy fighters
away from a command and control ship.
 Picking up transmissions.
 A C & C transport
that looks a lot...
 like that.
 Gotcha!
 Blood calls out for blood.
 Oh, excuse me.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 G'Kar!
 No.
 If you'll excuse me.
 Ambassador. Ambassador, no!
 Garibaldi.
 - Londo?
- Mr. Garibaldi.
 - We have to talk.
- Excuse me, another time.
 What's wrong with now?
Have someplace to go?
 Mr. Garibaldi, get out of my way.
 No, I can't do that.
 - Go back to your quarters.
- No.
 - Don't force me to make this official.
- No!
 I don't wanna do it...
 ...but touch a weapon,
and I'll kill you where you stand.
 - You don't understand.
- Yes, I do.
 I understand better
than you'll ever know.
 I know it burns. I know what
you wanna do, but this isn't the way.
 He's my blood, my nephew.
 If you kill G'Kar, no colonists will
get out alive. You have to know that.
 Yes.
 Well, it seems I'm still on target for
my appointment 20 years from now.
 - What appointment?
- It's a long story.
 Perhaps another time.
 Ambassador.
 In one hour, I'll check your quarters
for weapons. Make sure I find nothing.
 Mr. Garibaldi.
 Just now, would you really
have killed me?
 Yes. Yes, I would have.
 But I'm just as glad I didn't have to.
The paperwork's a pain in the butt.
 I understand there's a problem?
 I'm afraid there is, ambassador,
and I'm afraid it's you.
 We drove the Raiders
out of this sector.
 But look what I found on
the command and control ship.
 I wondered where
the Raiders got their weapons.
 Then I thought of our talk.
Narns sell to anyone who can pay.
 Just like during the war.
 You send an advisor
to show weapon operation...
 ...and to ensure they aren't
resold to a third party.
 When we disabled
the command and control ship...
 ...we went aboard
and found your friend here.
 That's not all.
 When the ship docked and we went
inside, we found these data crystals.
 They hold reports between
Ragesh 3 and Narn Central Command.
 They confirm what Mollari said
about the attack on the colony...
 ...that it was unprovoked.
The invitation was made at gunpoint.
 You have two choices.
 Tell your forces on Ragesh 3
to withdraw...
 ...or we bring this evidence
to the council.
 Chief?
 Your choice, ambassador.
 This should make Londo a happy man.
 Not to mention Earth Central.
We did it without sanctions.
 - The polls haven't even closed.
- I almost forgot to vote. Better go.
 Then my second favorite thing
in the universe.
 - If I find someone to share it with.
- Garibaldi, I don't even wanna know.
 ...incumbent President Luis Santiago
leads by 12 percent...
 ...though outer regions
may favor the challenger.
 Water.
 - Here you go, ma'am.
- Thank you.
 Thank you for your help, the situation
with the Centauri ambassador.
 It was an accident. I've been trained
to block out casual thoughts...
 ...but when you hit something
that powerful....
 I understand.
 I feel I should explain
my behavior earlier. I was rude.
 It's all right.
 I just wanted to know
if it was me.
 It's what you represent.
 My mother was like you, a telepath.
 None of us knew. It was
her secret since she was a girl.
 She wasn't trained,
couldn't use it well.
 That's why we have the Psi Corps,
to help telepaths.
 Bring out their talents
to the fullest.
 Yes, I imagine that's
what they told you.
 Were you raised by the Corps?
 Here you go.
 Then you never had to make the choice.
 When they discover what you are,
they give you three choices.
 You can either join the Psi Corps
or go to prison.
 Or agree to take certain drugs
for the rest of your life.
 Drugs that inhibit your abilities.
 That's the law.
 Unregistered telepaths
have to be controlled...
 to protect the privacy of others.
 Have you ever seen the results?
 They caught my mother
on her 35th birthday.
 She didn't want to join the Corps,
didn't want to go to prison.
 So they gave her the treatment.
 For 10 years, a man in a gray suit
came to the door once a week.
 And he gave her the injections.
 They were strong.
Terribly strong.
 Every day we just watched her drift
further and further away from us.
 The light in her eyes
just went out bit by bit.
 And when we thought
she could go no further...
 she took her own life.
 I'm sorry.
 What happened back then
is not your fault.
 But it's part of what you are.
 And yet you're as much of a victim
as my mother.
 I don't feel like a victim.
 No.
 And so far I cannot tell
if that is good or bad.
 Perhaps tomorrow we can start out
on better terms.
 I very much doubt it.
 Good night.
 The only remaining source is
on Planet X, somewhere in this area.
 And you want me to find Planet X?
Is that it?
 Can you do it, Dodgers?
 This is my second favorite thing
in the universe.
 ...around outer space
like Duck Dodgers...
 in the 24th-and-a-half century.
 God, I love this stuff.
 Explain this part to me again.
 Had the silly thing in reverse.
 With 70 percent of the vote tallied...
 ...we are declaring incumbent
President Luis Santiago the victor.
 Santiago promised to cut the budget
and to keep Earth out of war.
 His agenda includes creating a closer
relationship with the Mars colony...
 ...and preserving Earth cultures in the
face of growing non-Terran influences.
 End.
 Lights and good night.
 Commander, there's a problem.
 Commander?
