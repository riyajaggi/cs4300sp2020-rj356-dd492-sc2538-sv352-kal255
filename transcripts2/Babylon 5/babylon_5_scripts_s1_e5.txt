 You don't understand. This is my ceremonial blade. I am a pilgrim here for the sacred day of Chu'dag. I don't care. You can't bring this on the station. The maker of all things won't allow this. Nothing will stand between me and the blade. Yeah? Tell you what... ...I'll stick this on the hull and point you to an air lock. If you go after it, you can have it. You test my faith. And you're testing my patience. Move on before I decide to flunk out. We've got five more days of this to live through.

 Don't blame me. Blame Earth Central. ...demonstrates their religious beliefs? It'll advance the cause of peace and understanding. " As ideas go, this one's up there with having my gums extracted. Earth transport Spinoza will depart in one hour from Dock 9. - Never fails. - Chief? Nothing. Take over, I've got a few things to do. Yes? Are you Ambassador G'Kar? This is Ambassador G'Kar's quarters. This is Ambassador G'Kar's table. This is Ambassador G'Kar's dinner. Does the progression escape you? My apologies. I am Diplomatic Courier Tu'Pari. I just arrived on a ship from Homeworld.

 I was told to give this only to Ambassador G'Kar. Well, leave it. I'll look at it later. - I was told it was important. - Yes, I'm sure you were. You stay put. Greetings, Ambassador G'Kar. It's been a while, but I doubt you've forgotten your old associate, Du'Rog. I bring what you will doubtless consider good news: I am dying. About time. In fact, by the time you get this recording, I will already be dead. Cheers. Ah, but then, very shortly, so will you. It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind... ...10 years after the Earth-Minbari War. The Babylon Project was a dream given form. Its goal: to prevent another war by creating a place... ...where humans and aliens could work out their differences. It's a port of call, home away from home... ...for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers. Humans and aliens, wrapped in 2,500,000 tons... ...of spinning metal, all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place. But it's our last, best hope for peace. This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5. It should come as no surprise, G'Kar. You ruined my family's name and humiliated me before the council. Retribution was inevitable. But retribution is also expensive. Properly executed, it would leave me penniless. But I am a patient man. I've lived well, and I will die well. I have ordered my considerable assets liquidated upon my death. The funds will be given to someone eminently qualified to kill you. You will be dead within 48 hours of receiving this message. Already my agent is close to you. You will not know who or how or where... until it is too late. It pleases me to know that you will live in fear, G'Kar. But not for long. Someone close to me? Come. Diplomatic attache Na'Toth, reporting for duty. Your new aide, ambassador. Come. Commander. Garibaldi, I thought you'd be in full dress by now. Londo's hosting Centauri religious ceremonies. - I hear it helps to be on time. - Commander... These things can last up to a week. Eating, purging. Catherine's onboard. I saw her in customs. Thought I'd let you know. - Thanks. - Unless you want to see her. No, that's all right. Thanks. Mike. - Was she with anyone? - No. Not that I could see. Delenn! Is it not magnificent? It is quite... elaborate. It's a celebration of life. It comes from a time in our world's history... ...when two dominant species were fighting for supremacy: Our people and a species we called Xon. Each year, we'd count how many of our people survived... and celebrate our good fortune. - What happened to the Xon? - Dead. All of them. And good riddance. Do you know what the last Xon said just before he died? - Can I kill him now? - I'll get back to you. - You sure you don't want to see her? - Absolutely. Oh, come on! Commander, loosen up! You're supposed to enjoy yourself. I am. Words can't express how much I'm enjoying this. Londo, Londo. Tell me, what are these statues? Our household gods. In a world where every day is a struggle for survival... you need all the gods you can get. - Where is she? - Business area, Blue 3. Here, this is... This is Benzen, god of food. And Li, goddess of passion. And Morgoth, god of the underworld... and protector of front doors. Gods by the bushel, gods by the pound. Gods for all occasions. Have I ever told you that you're very cute for a Minbari? Oh, and you are cute too, in an annoying sort of way. Everybody's cute. Even me. But in purple, I'm stunning! He has become one with his inner self. - He's passed out. - That too. Commander, would you like some more...? Commander? Where's the commander? This is yours. - It's been a pleasure. - Yes. Commander? Hello, Jeff. Catherine. I didn't know you were in charge until I got here. If I'd known, I wouldn't have come. I keep my promises. - I'll leave now if you want me to. - No, I don't. You're here on business. That's what Babylon 5 is here for. - It's not a problem. - Good. Good. - How have you been? - Fine. Busy. Yes, I can imagine. You've done well. I'm glad. How's Carolyn? Good, last I heard. We went our separate ways. She wanted me to go into business with her, but that's not me. No, it's not. Commander Sinclair? Commander Sinclair. Your pants are talking to you. - I know, it's just... - Yes, you're a busy man. I'll let you get back to your business and I'll get back to mine. Take care, Jeff. Catherine... As long as you're on stopover... how about dinner? - Jeff, please... - Just dinner. This is my station, and I'm very proud of her. I'd like to show you around. This is how we get in trouble every three years. All right. Just dinner. I'd give you my berth number... ...but I suspect you know how to find me, commander. Something, ambassador? Just thinking about last week. The unfortunate accident... ...that caused the sudden demise of my first aide. Very sudden. Who sponsored you to be my attache? Counselor Li'Dak, Fifth Circle. - Then you must know Du'Rog. - No, I've never met him. You're certain about someone you've never met. Isn't it possible you met someone named Counselor Du'Rog? - Anything is possible. - Yes. Anything. What would you say if I told you Du'Rog hired someone to kill me? Someone close to me? Ambassador, with all due respect, if it were me... you wouldn't be here. Du'Rog wants to prolong my discomfort for the next 48 Earth hours. The last thing he wants is a quick death. How can you be sure? What if he told you this to scare you? - Unlikely. - As you said, anything is possible. If he wanted the best, he'd have gone to the assassin's guild. The Thenta Makur leave a black flower near victims as a warning... ...so they can ready themselves. Have you received a death blossom? No. Then I wouldn't worry. Get some sleep. The question will resolve itself soon enough. And you have no idea how that got into my bed? It is not my place to speculate on how anything gets into your bed. Your reputed fascination with Earth women, for instance. If you're worried, go to the commander. He could protect you. I fight my own battles. I survived our war of independence and two assassination attempts. I can survive this! Asking for help requires explaining why Du'Rog wanted me dead. This would lead to revelations about my years on the council. Revelations that could affect my position. I don't care if the information comes out. I worry that it might compromise our standing in the negotiations. We must handle this quietly for the sake of planetary security. Of course. Ambassador... ...if you think I'm involved, why tell me all this? Earthers say, "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. " They stole it from us. I look forward to strengthening our relationship. Find the courier who brought me this message. His name was Tu'Pari. I must find out who gave it to him. He's probably left by now. No ships for Narn have left since yesterday. He's still here. Finding him will be your first test. Now I'll arrange for a little protection. - I thought you weren't telling anyone. - I'm not. Alliance transport Southern Passage is in its final stages... ...for departure to Arturas 4 at boarding area 1-Alpha. Satai Delenn? Lennier of the Third Fane of Chudomo. - I was sent. - Yes. I've been expecting you. You can look up, Lennier of the Third Fane of Chudomo. It is forbidden. I can't have an aide who won't look up. You'll forever walk into things. Please. Better. Now, come. Forgive me if I am slow, Satai Delenn... but this is all quite new to me. To go from a novitiate to working with one of the Grey Council. Your teachers spoke well of you. You will adjust. Begin by promising not to mention the Grey Council again during your stay. No one here knows of my connection. No one must find out. - But to deny the council... - I am denying nothing. But it would lead to certain questions that I don't want to answer. You will not use my title Satai. You will address me only as Delenn. Do you understand? No, but understanding is not required. Only obedience. Good. Your arrival is well-timed. We are displaying our rituals, our religions and our sacred days. You'll help demonstrate the Minbari religion. The Third Fane of Chudomo has served with honor for 500 years. I will not disappoint you, Sat... Delenn. Then I am content. Now, tell me of home, Lennier. I have been away far too long. - You wish protection? - Yes. Mighty Narn Empire. Soldiers, guns. And you come to N'Grath? I need a bodyguard. Someone who isn't from my own world. It avoids certain complications. - Expensive. - Oh, just name your price. I have to attend the Minbari ceremony. Will you have someone by then? Is this satisfactory? Oh, yes. It's been so long since I've seen you out of uniform. - Isn't this a breach of protocol? - I'm off duty. - You're never off duty. - Maybe you didn't know me. You're right, I didn't. But whose fault was that? - Catherine... - Commander, how are you? - It's good to see you. - And you. - David will be your waiter tonight. - Thank you. I was surprised to see you here. I don't see why. Seems we run into each other... about every two or three years. Half the time, one of us is with someone else... The other half, the dance goes like this: We meet, catch up, talk about old times at the academy. We ask about each other's family. We lie about not missing each other and we end up in bed. - You leave. - Last time it was you. - No, it wasn't. - Yes, it was. Was it? You're right. Last time it was me. God, who can keep it all straight anymore? I was thinking of you the other day. Wondering what you were doing. - I think of you in summer. - I think of you in the fall. We never could agree on anything. I still have your letters. The long battles, the brief truces. The longer silences punctuated by moments of passion... that we both end up regretting. I read them to remind myself why we shouldn't get together again. And why I shouldn't miss you. We're supposed to reminisce and ask about old friends first, remember? No, not this time. That's a bad idea. We're not good for each other. It was always three parts passion, two parts teeth. - Can't go through that again. - Agreed. - How's your aunt? - How's your brother? I can't believe I'm going through all this with you again. Neither can I. I see such trouble. Will you follow me into fire? Into storm? Into darkness? Into death? And the nine said, "Yes. " Then do this in testimony to the one who will follow... ...who will bring death couched in the promise of new life... and renewal disguised as defeat. From birth, through death and renewal. You must put aside old things... old fears... old lives. This is your death. The death of flesh, the death of pain. The death of yesterday. Taste of it... and be not afraid. For I am with you to the end of time. Taste of it. And so... it begins. I was told a bodyguard would be at the ceremony! I was all alone! "Taste of your own death, " indeed. Ambassador! The other room. You were supposed to meet me at the Minbari ceremony! You just came in and found this guy dead in your bedroom. That's right. Never seen him before. You have no idea why he was here. Yes, we've already gone over all this. - Just getting your story. - It's not my story, it's the truth! When this individual was killed, I was at the Minbari ceremony with you. Yeah, I remember. I also remember you looking pretty distracted the whole time. Yours? Get out. Don't push, ambassador. I'm still head of security. Under the terms of our treaty, diplomatic quarters are foreign soil. Since I have diplomatic immunity, I don't have to answer any questions. I called as a courtesy. Spend a little more time finding out who killed him... ...and a little less time engaging in your usual harassment. You're right, ambassador. My apologies. - When you finish, I want a report. - Yes, sir. Just let me say, from the bottom of my heart... hot pink is definitely your color. Departure for Mars colony... Are you Courier Tu'Pari? - Yes. - Come with me. I'm needed elsewhere. I have orders. So do I. I'm already an hour late in bringing you to Ambassador G'Kar. If you do not come with me, you will be the late Courier Tu'Pari. I came across another candidate over in Grid Epsilon. Coordinates 471-18-25. A Class 2 planetoid, not enough atmosphere to sustain sentient life. Mineral content? High levels of platinum, derinium. You name it, it's there. - We have some good news. - Yes, you hit the big time. I don't understand. The last planet that you surveyed for us turned up quantium 40. Under the terms of our contract, you're entitled to some of the profit. How's that look to you? Oh, my. We've got to go back to Earth. I imagine you'll want to celebrate. Good day. We'll see you at the hub. Great. Thanks. Cheers! Come. Courier Tu'Pari, ambassador, as you requested. Good. I do wish to speak to him alone if you don't mind, Na'Toth. Who gave you the data crystal that you delivered to me? It was from Counselor Du'Rog. Du'Rog is dead. Someone had to give it to you on his orders. Counselor Shu'Toth. The father of my attache, Na'Toth? The danger is much closer to you than you think, ambassador. I am become a name For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and known Cities of men and manners Climates, councils, governments Honored of them all And drunk delight of battle With my peers... Pause. Come. Do you know how expensive things are here? 500 credits for a loaf of bread, a jug of wine and some Antarean flarn. I have good news and I'm tired of not having anyone to share it with. Tennyson? You've been caught on that since the academy. Can we drag you into the 23rd century? We find meaning where we can. And which are you? "An idle king doling unequal laws unto a savage race... ...that hoard and sleep and feed and know not you? " Or "This gray spirit yearning in desire to follow knowledge like... a sinking star. " - I didn't know you'd memorized it. - I lived with you for a year. - Do you have something to open this? - I'm not sure this is a good idea. - Don't do this. - We're over each other. Who says? Who says I got over you and you got over me? You don't just turn it off like a switch. I don't sleep on one side of the bed, but only because you aren't there. I'd think about you and get angry at myself for being a fool. - Then, when I saw you yesterday... - What do you want from me? I don't know what I'm doing here. I don't know anything anymore. I just didn't want to celebrate alone. Maybe I needed you. Maybe I just needed someone. And right now, for this one moment, I don't care. Don't send me away. Don't make me feel like a fool. I couldn't do that. You have to know me better than that. Commander. It's all right. Go. Yes? We've got a brownout in Green 2. We need authorization to reroute power from sensors. Fine, fine. Authorization granted. I should go. Sorry, I shouldn't have come. - Catherine... - You can have the flarn, I never... Don't touch me unless you mean it! I request that my attache, Na'Toth, be reassigned to another sector. I want her picked up within the hour. Confirmed. - I'm sorry for the delay in dispatch. - What delay? Our courier, Ru'Dak, met with an accident before he left for Babylon 5. - We haven 't found a replacement. - What? The courier is right here. You should sleep. You'll have to get up soon. I'm fine. It's been a long road, hasn't it? The academy. The war. And here we are, making the same mistakes all over again. I don't know. Maybe. Maybe not. Well, at least we have tonight. Soon you'll be the busy commander again. So let's enjoy it while we can. If there were a problem, they'd tell you. Ah, you're awake. Good. That will make this far more entertaining. Those are pain-givers on your neck and wrists, ambassador. If you come within 10 feet of me while wearing them... ...you will experience pain such as you cannot conceive. Come within five feet and they will kill you. What do you want? My orders are quite specific. You are to know pain. You are to know fear. And then you are to die at the required hour. I confess I'll be happy when this assignment is finished. Allaying the target's suspicions can be so time-consuming. Do you know how long I waited in the customs area for Na'Toth to find me? Whatever you were paid, whatever the price... ...I can double it! - Yes. I imagine you could make me extremely wealthy. But to betray a commission violates the spirit of the Thenta Makur... ...and then they would have to kill me. It's unfortunate but we must all make our little sacrifices, ambassador. I have made mine... and you are about to make yours. Ambassador? Ambassador G'Kar? Re-establish contact with last transmission. Confirmed. Stand by. The pain must be overwhelming. Why hold it in? Cry out, ambassador. With luck, someone will hear you. I would die before giving you... that satisfaction. As you wish. Na'Toth! I'm glad to see my instincts were correct. I knew you'd need complete privacy. Once I determined which transport tubes had suddenly broken down... I figured out where you were. This is none of your affair, Na'Toth. Leave while you can. Not until I've done what I came here to do. I'm your backup, Tu'Pari. Hired to finish the job if you fail. - I wasn't told about a backup. - No, the primary never is. Standard practice in the assassin's guild. Why should I believe you? I see you're using pain-givers. Crude. Unimaginative. And much too quick. Our orders were to prolong his discomfort. And what would you recommend? - Na'Toth! - At your service, ambassador. And this is the part where I'm supposed to decide I trust you... ...drop my guard and let you shoot me in the back. Sorry, but I can't take the chance that you're lying. You're making a mistake. Perhaps. That hurt. It was the only way to disable the pain-givers. I had to hit them as hard as possible, and often... ...and make it appear as if I were beating you. - And you didn't enjoy it in the least? - I didn't say that. What are you going to do with Tu'Pari? Well, well, you're finally awake. I thought the injection wouldn't wear off for another day. Another day? It's been 72 hours since you were knocked out. You missed your deadline. To make up for it, I deposited a great deal of money to your account. No! The Thenta Makur... They'll think I betrayed my commission, sold out our principles. They will kill me. Yes, they will, won't they? I imagine they're on their way. They should be here in one hour. It would be unfortunate if they found you when they arrived. Happily, I'm safe because the commission was yours alone. They're so scandalized that they'd rather forget the whole thing. Except for the part about killing him. Except for that, yes. Transport now departing from Bay 3. Passengers, please begin boarding procedure. I suggest you board quickly. With luck, they won't find you. But if they do, you will know pain. - And you will know fear. - And then you'll die. Pleasant flight. When you took his spectacles and smashed them, I thought... Enjoying the last day of the festival? More than you could possibly imagine. Good day. He's in a good mood. Maybe Earth Central was right about this festival idea. It's been quiet the last day or so. Guess I'm your good-luck charm. - Sure you have to go? - Just for a few days. I have to survey the Deneb sector or I lose the commission. See you when I get back? - I'm not leaving this time. - Neither am I. This should be interesting. Have you figured how to demonstrate Earth's dominant belief system? No, and I don't know how to top the Minbari. Bells, drums, robes and little pieces of fruit. - Red fruit? - Yeah. And was there a serious exchange of looks? Yes, it's supposed to be part of the rebirth ceremony. What? It's a rebirth ceremony, all right. It doubles as a marriage ceremony. Depending on how seriously anyone took it... somebody got married. Maybe that's why G'Kar's smiling. Funny. I didn't think Londo was his type. - See you next Wednesday? - Try and stop me. Jeff? - Think we'll get it right this time? - I don't know. Fair enough. - Mr. Garibaldi! - He'll be just a few more minutes. What sort of demonstration does he have planned? He just said it'd showcase Earth's dominant belief system. - I don't hear any drums. - Or bells. Or chants. You're sure this is the right place? That's it, I'm leaving. This is where he said to wait, so we wait. All right, we're all set. If you'll come this way. This is Mr. Harris. He's an atheist. Father Cresanti, a Roman Catholic. Mr. Hayakawa, a Zen Buddhist. Mr. Rashid, a Moslem. Mr. Rosenthal, an Orthodox Jew. Running Elk, of the Oglala Sioux faith. Father Papapoulous, a Greek Orthodox. Ogigi-ko, of the Ebo tribe. Machukiak, a Yupik Eskimo. Sawa, of the Jivaro tribe. Isnakuma, a Bantu. Ms. Chang, a Taoist. Mr. Blacksmith, an aborigine. Ms. Yamamoto, a Shinto. Ms. Naijo, a Maori. Mr. Gold, a Hindu...
