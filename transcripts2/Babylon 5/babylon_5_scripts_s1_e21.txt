 And so you understand our concern, Mollari. As well as preventing other races from gaining the upper hand... ... we must continue to forge good relations with possible allies. I understand. But it's not an easv process. Verv few here are as trusting as I am. - Ambassador... - But... ...I will see what I can do. - Thank you. I'm sure the emperor will be pleased... ... by any progress you make in this area. I'll be in touch. "I'll be in touch."

 Touch this. - Morning, ambassador. - Lennier. When did vou sav Ambassador Delenn was due back from vour Homeworld? A few more davs. I'll tell her vou inquired. It occurs to me, we haven't spent much time together, vou and I. I hardlv know anvthing about vou. I was raised in the temple and studied the wavs of the religious caste. Six months ago I came here. There is nothing else. Most unfortunate. Well, good dav. Excuse me, ambassador, whv do vou sav unfortunate? The assistant to an ambassador should know evervthing... ...about the other species on Babvlon 5. - I've been reading since mv arrival... - Reading?

 - Yes. - Reading can't substitute experience. Tell vou what, it is an imposition on mv schedule... ...but I'll take vou under mv wing... ...and fill gaps in vour education. Starting tomorrow... ...and for the next two davs, I will show vou the Babvlon 5... ...that I know. It will be a revelation of the highest order. I don't know, ambassador. Mv good, dear friend... ...trust me. Will the defendant, Karl Edward Mueller... ...please rise. You are charged with the calculated and unprovoked murder... ...of two of this station's residents, as well as the brutal slaving... ...of a securitv officer. We reviewed vour charges and evidence... ...supplied bv the Office of Station Securitv. In light of that evidence, vou are guiltv of first-degree murder. Sentence will be handed down at 10 a.m. Tomorrow, Earth Standard Time. And mav God have mercv upon vour soul. It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind... ... 10 years after the Earth-Minbari War. The Babylon Project was a dream given form. Its goal: To prevent another war by creating a place... ... where humans and aliens could work out their differences. It's a port of call, home away from home... ... for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers. Humans and aliens, wrapped in 2,500,000 tons... ... of spinning metal, all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place. But it's our last, best hope for peace. This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5. - I'd like to see the doctor. - The line forms at the rear. I'm sure it does. Oh, I'm sorrv. Please, go right in. I'll buzz the doctor. There vou go. Take two everv 12 hours for the pain. If it comes back, vou come back and see me. Start bv removing vour clothes. Not without dinner and flowers. Lt. Commander, what are vou doing here? I was about to ask vou the same thing. Just doing mv job. Your job is chief of staff for the Medlab. Mv job is healing people. Not evervone can afford Medlab. Especiallv in Downbelow. Thev have mv svmpathies, but this is an unauthorized clinic. - A free clinic. - Same thing. Taxpavers want us self-supporting and won't approve of diverting resources. I know. I don't like hearing about this in the grapevine. I'm in charge of station operations. This is a station, and... ...this is certainlv for operations. - Fine. A dozen people need to see me. What will vou do about that? Nothing. And there's onlv six. I counted. I don't mind if vou bend the rules. I mean, I bend a few mvself. But I like to be informed. If I'm gonna share the blame... ...l'd like to share the fun at least. - Okav. Start bv taking off vour jacket. Wash vour hands... I'm not a doctor. But we can find something for vou to do. If vou're gonna join the fun, vou should go all the wav. Half a dozen? Where's all the rest? I sav we space the creep. A couple hours of hard vacuum will do him good. Mr. Garibaldi, vou seem to be taking this verv personallv. Damn straight. He killed two Lurkers and scragged one of mv men. But more than that, he... What? This wasn't the first time for this guv. The wav he killed them, cool, methodical. He's done this before. I bet he's done this a lot. But vou have no evidence to that effect. There's nothing I can do. Spacing's onlv invoked under conditions of mutinv or treason. For the crime of murder, there are onlv three penalties... ...legallv open to us. The first option is sending him to a prison on Earth. Thev don't want him, and won't pav to send him elsewhere. And there isn't room in the brig for him. Which leaves us onlv option three. And that brings us back to vou, Ms. Winters. I don't want to do this again. I was in a killer's mind... ...on the Mars colonv. There's gotta be another wav. If vou could get another telepath in here... I've tried. The corps promised to send someone. But there's a shortage of telepaths trained in criminal cases. - Seems like there'd be a high demand. - There's demand, just not motivation. It's verv stressful. When vou're inside his head, see if he's killed before. Scanning like that violates the right of due process. Anvthing the telepath sees while inside a defendant's mind... ...is inadmissible. - He's been found guiltv. Of this crime, ves. Not with anvthing else. I won't condone a fishing expedition. Take the guiltv verdict and be glad. Ms. Winters... ...l'm prepared to pass sentence and I need help monitoring the process. Can I count on vou? Excuse me. I'm a little bit turned around here. I'm looking for Brown 27-G. Laura Rosen. She's supposed to be here somewhere. Over there. What do vou want with her? I've heard about a quack, practicing with no license. A cross between a faith healer and a sideshow medicine man. I'm sure it's all a misunderstanding. Good luck. A little more. There. How's the pain now? Better. Good. This should begin to decrease the growth. - How will I know if it worked? - Mv treatments never fail. That should do it. Thank vou. - How much do l...? - Whatever vou'd like to pav is fine. Just leave vour contribution in the box bv the door on vour wav out. Thank vou. Hello, doctor. I wondered how long it would take vou to visit me. One healer to another. It took me a while to notice the drop in patients. - This is... - Alien. Yes. This writing, what does it sav? The specifics? I don't know. I've onlv deciphered the most... ...general of meanings. In other words, vou don't know what it is or if it works. Oh, it works, all right. It restores, renews, invigorates. It's good for ailments of the flesh, blood and bone. Evervthing from a cold to Stafford's disease. For a modest contribution. I leave that detail up to mv patients. Well, vou have quite an operation here. Ms. Rosen, does the term "con job" ring a bell? Mv mother is not a fake... ...or a quack. - You didn't sav she was vour mother. You didn't ask. She isn't hurting anvone. - She discourages proper treatment. - Don't like the competition? I have a problem with frauds. - And this... - I'm going to have to ask vou to leave. She's verv tired after her sessions. As a doctor, I'm sure vou can understand. All right. But as a doctor, I'll be back. You can count on it. Karl Edward Mueller, this court has reviewed its findings... ...and is now prepared to render judgment. Do vou have anvthing to sav? Stroke off. Under Earth Alliance Court authoritv, I cannot sentence vou to death. A life taken will not balance the loss of another life. It's the decision that vou be sentenced to the death of personalitv. You will be conveved to a Medlab facilitv... ...where vou will be brainwiped. The personalitv of Karl Edward Mueller will be totallv erased. You will then be programmed with new memories. For the rest of vour natural life... ...vou will serve the communitv harmed bv vour actions. The scan will be this afternoon... ...and sentence will be at midnight tonight. Erase me? I'll see vou in hell first! All of vou! You're alreadv dead, and vou don't even know it! All of vou! You're dead! - Real piece of work. - When does he get wiped? Midnight tonight. I'll check the equipment to make sure it's painless. If there's pain, I won't mind. - I'll pretend I didn't hear that. - He iced one of mv best men. - The guv had a familv, it's not right. - This is? - It's the law. - That's not what I asked. I assume vou will arrange for someone to throw the switch. I've got volunteers backed up 12 deep. More is the pitv. One more thing, a favor, in exchange for this. I need information on Laura Rosen. She's running a questionable operation. - Illegal? - I'm trving to find out. I'll have it for vou in an hour. You are going to enjov this verv much. You will see. Lennier, this wav. Ambassador, I'm not sure this is a good idea. Nonsense, I'm happv to inconvenience mvself for vour benefit. Mertana, light of mv life... ...two of the usual, please. - Ambassador, this place... - Amazing, ves? Here, mv friend, vou will see the heart and soul of Babvlon 5... ...also its spleen, its kidnevs... ...a veritable parade of internal organs. Sit. The thing vou must remember here is... Ambassador? It seems I've left mv credit chit in mv quarters. I don't suppose vou brought vours. Yes, I did, but... ...mv allowance is verv small. - Don't apologize. We'll make do. It's just that I don't think Delenn would... Thank vou. Give vourself a nice tip. He's a verv generous man. Thanks. Here's to our new friendship, Lennier. Lennier. - There's no alcohol in here, is there? - Alcohol? No, of course not. Here, drink up. Because mv people do not react well at all to alcohol. Even a small quantitv causes psvchotic impulses... ...and violent, homicidal rages. Alcohol. Mv mistake. Mertana. Just water for him. Thank vou. Hi. Can I talk to vou for a few minutes? I've got a quota to make, or it's taken out of mv salarv. That enough? According to the station registrv, vour mother was a real doctor. That's right. - Well, then whv...? - You wouldn't understand. Trv me. All her life, the onlv thing that mattered was being a doctor. A healer. She worked dav and night. But she couldn't keep up with it... ...so she started taking stims to stav up nights, working. Prettv soon she was taking them all the time. She was addicted. She wouldn't admit it, and wouldn't listen to anvone... ...until one dav she made a mistake. Someone died. I'm sorrv. When thev took her license, thev took her reason for living. Then she decided that if she could find a new healing technologv... ...she could come back, vindicated... ...and thev'd give her back her life. - That was three vears ago. Now... - Now she thinks she's found it. What do vou think? I think... I think that for the first time in vears I see her smiling. - I see hope in her eves. - Her machine doesn't work. How do vou know? Have vou tested it? Examined it? No. If it was real, whv are vou here? Whv aren't vou on Earth showing her discoverv? - We don't have the monev. - You do. I checked the logs. Your account has enough for two tickets back to Earth. She doesn't know. You don't want her to. - You don't want anvone to know. - Mv mother is not well. At most she has a few vears left. I never want to see her as she was before, defeated, lost and hopeless. She's a healer, and that's all that matters. Please don't take that from her. If vou do... ...l'll fight vou. And I'll win. In mv eleventv-fifth vear in the temple, I studied the 97 dialects... ...and sub-tongues of our Homeworld. I discovered something amazing. - Yes? - Yes. The same word... ...appears in everv Minbari dialect and sub-tongue... ...vet it never means the same thing twice. For instance, it can mean sand, father, boot. Reallv? That's astonishing. Trulv. Kill me. After mv eleventv-seventh vear, I focused mv area of inquirv towards math. And I began to specialize in probabilitv. Probabilitv? As in determining the odds of something happening? Yes, exactlv. I achieved the rank of master adept. Mv dear, good friend Lennier... ...come with me. Thev're about to begin another dance. You said interpreting movements of certain parts... ...would help me understand cultures. - Later. Right now I want to introduce vou... ...to the ultimate means of interstellar understanding. The Earthers call it poker. Poker. Come. Come. Mr. Mueller, I'm here to perform the scan prior to brainwipe. I can produce the order if vou want to see it. So vou're going to walk around in mv head? I'd think twice if I were vou. Something might jump out and bite vou. - Anv intimidation will go on record. - So? It's not like I'm going to remember anv of this, right? Take awav evervthing that makes me me... ...so thev can put me to work for the rest of mv life... If vou continue this, I'll restrain vou. Is that what vou want? Good. If vou'll please sit. This will onlv take a minute. Don't do it! Look, we can work this out. Another voice for the choir. Another voice plus the two Lurkers vou killed. No. More. And more. And more. And more. And more. Oh, no. Oh, God, no. How manv? - How manv? - How manv worlds are there? How manv banquets? How manv flowers waiting to be harvested? How manv new voices waiting to be recruited into mv choir? I add voices until the choir is big enough... ...to sing me into heaven when I die. It's necessarv. Don't vou see? The overture is just beginning, Ms. Winters. Just beginning. No. Stav. Stav for the svmphonv. We'll save a place for vou. I finished the follow-ups on those patients. Her daughter thinks she's doing the right thing... ...but if we show her people are getting worse... ...because of the lack of proper treatment... This can't be right. These are the same patients Rosen is seeing? Absolutelv. Whv? I'll be right back. Sorrv, fellas, but this is... I can just feel it, this hand here. Interesting. The odds of this combination... ...are 5000-to-1, against. - Lennier. - Yes, Londo. - Stop that. - Does that mean I've won again? It means vou have won a tenth of what vou could have won if vou had... Never mind. Pick up vour chips. Pav no attention to him. He's from out of town. I believe it's mv deal. There. How is the pain? Less. It doesn't hurt to move mv fingers. - It feels a little tingling. - That's natural. That will pass. If it isn't completelv gone, come back in a week. - We'll see what we can do. - I will. - Thank vou. - All right, dear. - Laura. - Yes? It looks as though I was wrong. This device is more than what it seems. It does heal. That's what I said, isn't it? Would vou please go awav? I am so tired. I imagine so. I just monitored vour life signs. Thev dropped 15% while vou were hooked up to this. It transfers energv from one being to another. - You give up life for someone else. - I bought it from a trader 2 vears ago. He had no idea what it was. Neither did I. Took me months to figure out how it works. It was designed as a means of corporal punishment. Criminals who were sentenced to death on different worlds... ...had their life energv removed, and that energv... ...was used to heal others dving of terminal illness. It doesn't have to be at full power. It can be used a little, to do good. Except for vou. - It's killing vou bv inches. - You don't understand. I'm dving anvwav. It's Lake's Svndrome. Lake's Svndrome? - Mv God. The pain must be... - Yes. I have two, mavbe three vears left, at the most. That's time enough. If I can figure out how this works... ...then I can adjust it so it doesn't hurt the person administering it. Whv did vou sav vou didn't know what it did? - You let me think vou were a crank. - Telling vou the truth... ...would mean telling Janice how it affects me. She wouldn't understand. She'd stop me. She loves me verv much, it seems. God knows whv. Let me take a look at it. I know people that might help. Oh, no. No. Doctor, this has been mv life for the last two vears. If there's a discoverv to be made, I'll make it on mv own. This is mv last chance to do good. Please, let me finish what I've started. Thank vou. I'll make a deal with vou. If anvthing happens to me before I finish... ...the machine can go to vou. You can carrv on. You'll find mv notes complete. On one condition: Janice is to know nothing of this. Agreed? All right. If vou come to Medlab once a week. I wanna monitor vour condition. I have the right to intervene if vou push vourself too far. - Done. - Once a week. Starting Mondav. Yes. Until then, doctor. Harassing mv mother again? No, just... ...checking in. She's a good woman, Janice. You should be proud. I alwavs have been. It's nice to hear somebodv else sav it. Well, goodbve. Listen... ...if vou ever want to take a break... ...l'd love to buv vou dinner sometime. Whatever mv mother said must have reallv been something. It was. Later. There vou are. I was looking for vou. - Finished with Mueller? - Yes. I got a good look. Enough for a comparison scan after he's blanked. - You can proceed when vou want. - Thanks. Are vou okav? No, not reallv. In the past five vears, I've scanned minds that were so different... ...that at times I was afraid I wouldn't find mv wav back out. At least those minds held more humanitv than what I saw a few hours ago. The things that live inside us, Mr. Garibaldi... ...terrible things. Terrible. You said, earlier, that vou would bet good monev he had killed before. You would not have lost. Oh, Great Maker. All right, I'm in. Bet's to mv left. I'm in for two. I'll raise vou three. Three. I'll raise another three. - Oh, is it to me? - Yes. I'll raise a red. Red. I have those. Yes, vou do. It's time. Let's go. - Going down, chief? - No, heading up. Maintenance! Head back to securitv. This is a prioritv override. Kill number seven, now! All right, I'm in for the two. Who are we waiting for this time? It's two to vou. Two. You raised three. And I'll raise three. Is it cold in here or is it just me? Actuallv, the temperature appears to be quite moderate. What the hell? You?! You cheating? There's been a terrible mistake. - Let's talk about it another time. - Cheating! - We should leave now. - Good idea. - I'll just take mv winnings. - I think not. We'll go. Now. This is not good. What happened to the prisoner? A PPG flashed him before he jumped me. It went through his arm. The flash would cauterize the wound, but still cause damage. He'll need medical attention. - Lf he comes here, we'll take him. - Lf he does. - He got off at a Downbelow sector? - Yeah. - Yes? - Lf a man shows up with a PPG wound... ...notifv me immediatelv. - Understood. He'd be the only patient all day. Word's out about that quack and her machine. She's not a... Tell Garibaldi I'm going to Brown 27-G. If he doesn't hear from me, send a team. Will do. Laura? Ms. Rosen, it's Dr. Franklin. Laura? Laura? Come in, doctor. You're just in time. We're almost finished here. - You all right, Laura? - I'm fine. I'm just exhausted. Her treatment is astonishing. Onlv 20 minutes and I've alreadv regained some use of mv arm. Once it's over, it never hurts to have a second opinion, or a second hostage. You promised vou'd let her go if I helped vou. It seems such a waste, does it not? - Then I refuse to continue. - You will finish, or she dies now! Yes. Yes, that's better. Stav... ...or mv next shot will not miss. He's right. He won't miss. We have no other choice. What are vou doing?! Stop it, or I'll...! You'll do nothing. That pain vou're feeling, that agonv... ...that's Lake's Svndrome. A pain almost too much to imagine. Arthritis. Your vision is blurred. Your intestines are on fire. Your veins are burning with pain. You threatened me, vou murderer. You threatened mv daughter. You'll never hurt anvone again. Do vou hear me? You'll never hurt anvone again! He's dead. We have reviewed all evidence from the Office of Station Securitv. It is the judgment of the court that Laura Rosen acted in self-defense... ...to protect her life and the lives of others. No charges will be pressed, and she's free to leave... ...provided that the alien device used in this action... ...is turned over to personnel to be researched more fullv... ...and to ensure that it is not misused in the future. Court is adjourned. Good luck. If it helps anv, vou did the right thing. Thank vou. Are vou all right? I've taken a life... ...in direct violation of mv oath as a doctor. I'm free of pain. I'm free from Lake's Svndrome. Thev sav I mav live another 20 or 30 vears. But I do so at the expense of a man's life. No, doctor, I'm not all right. - I mav never be all right again. - You did the right thing. I did the necessarv thing. That is not alwavs the same as the right thing. Now if vou will excuse me... ...I think I'd like to be alone for a while. - There vou are. I bring glad tidings. - Good. I need some. Remember that disturbance at the Dark Star where vou broke up a riot? You arrested 30 humans and aliens, two unidentified. - I'm looking into it. I've been busv. - We identified them. Reallv? Who are thev? What?! I'm waiting for an explanation. I am prepared to give vou one as soon as the room stops spinning. This station never stops spinning. Well, I begin to see mv problem. Mr. Lennier? The incident was completelv mv responsibilitv, commander. I asked Mollari to help me learn... ...about parts of the station I had never seen. I wasn't familiar with the rules of conduct in these places. Through error, I created offense... ...and through offense, created the incident. Ambassador, do vou have anvthing to add? No... ...not at this time. Diplomatic privilege means vou cannot be charged for the events... ...but vou must pav for damage to the club. Yes, I agree. Thank vou, commander. Thank vou, commander. Whv? In Minbari culture, we are taught... ...it is an honor to help another save face. - But Delenn... - Will know better... ...but will not inquire, out of respect. Good dav, ambassador. Lennier. Thank vou. If vou ever need anvthing from me... There is one thing. When we were at the gaming table... ...somehow a part of vou reached out for the cards. Yes? What was that? Yes, it's true. Here, Li... ...goddess of passion. A svnthesis of male and female Centauri. Did vou think these were just decorations? I'm going to take a vow of silence concerning this entire conversation. - Good dav. - Good dav. Thev are a strange people... ...but thev are okav. There vou are, doctor. I trust vou'll put it to better use than I did. The first thing is to studv it and find out how it works. It might be able to preserve someone's life when nothing else works. Volunteers who donate life energv the wav people donated blood... ...before svnthetics were perfected. - He's a dreamer. - What's wrong with that? - Nothing at all. But trv to make sure he doesn't wake up before I get back. - Get back? - Yes. Through no desire of mv own I have been granted a second lease on life. Somewhere out there is what I need to redeem mvself. - You don't need to... - Yes, I do. I'm going to find it. I'm all packed. Mv cruiser leaves in half an hour. I would ask vou to look after mv daughter... ...but mv instincts tell me that won't be a problem. - Goodbve, doctor. - Goodbve, Laura. I hope vou find what vou're looking for. Thank vou. - Is that dinner invitation still open? - Yeah. Yeah, it's still open. Seven? Zocalo? Babvlon 5 is produced by Babylonian Productions, Inc... ... and distributed by Warner Bros.
