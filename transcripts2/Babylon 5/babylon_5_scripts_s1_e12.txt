 Yeah, I know. You're really busting my cojones today. -Slide her into Bay 8. -Thanks. Tal'Quith, proceed to Docking Bay 8 via Beacon Alpha 6. About time. We have computer failure! lt's raising the transport! Platform 6 activated. Departure sequence engaged. -Collision warning. -lt's gonna collide with the Narn ship! Computer, override sequence. Tal'Quith, switch to Beacon Zeta. Do not alter course. Do not start your engines! -Bay 6, damage report. -Hydraulic fuel lines are ruptured! -Lock the bay. Swift Team's coming. -Hurry! Two people are trapped! lf they don't get out, they'll die! It was the dawn of the Third Age of mankind...

 ... 1 0 years after the Earth-Minbari War. The Babylon Project was a dream given form. Its goal: to prevent another war by creating a place... ... where humans and aliens could work out their differences. It's a port of call, home away from home... ...for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs and wanderers. Humans and aliens, wrapped in 2,500,000 tons... ...of spinning metal, all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous place. But it's our last, best hope for peace. This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5. Get up here quick! We're opening the air lock just long enough for you to get in and get out! -Okay? -All right. Open up! -Clear. -Okay, let's go. Right with you. Hey, get somebody over here. Let's get them out of here! -Who do we have trapped in there? -Two members of Team 21 . -Twenty-one? -Yeah. Delvientos, open it up! We're coming out! Okay, they're coming. Back off. You okay? Move it! Spread out! He's dead. Alberto! My brother! To you, l give the grain, the light and the sky. To you, a sacred heritage. To you, the land and sea. Ambassador? So spoke G'Quan, at the dawn of all mornings. Enter! l'm sorry to disturb you at this time. . . . . .but l bring unhappy news. There was an accident on one of our ships. The Tal'Quith. -Was there much damage? -The cargo bay was blown out. l'm afraid the G'Quan Eth was destroyed in the accident. No. No. Oh, no. Don't try to blame my people for this! We've always said the equipment can't handle the traffic! The malfunction may have been due to operator error. Even if that were true, what do you expect? We work triple shifts because we are understaffed! -We're not here to assign blame. -Maybe you aren't. My government wants to know who's responsible for our ship. Start with your captain who panicked and fired his engines against orders! Don't try to blame this on us! We're the victims. You lost some cargo, ambassador. Alberto Delvientos lost his life. A tragedy, to be sure. But what was our captain to do? His ship was placed in jeopardy and he reacted! And by G'Quan, we'll be compensated for the damage! lf you'll excuse me, l must attend to a pressing matter. The problem was equipment failure. A cluster of microchips blew out. -How is that possible? -Contractors used substandard chips. That explains their low bid on the installation. This will ruin our schedule. How long before we get Bay 6 online? Hours. We gotta reroute the controls until new chips are installed. The problems dockside run much deeper than a few microchips, commander. l'm aware of that, Ms. Connally. l've tried to make the Senate understand we need a budget increase. -l just hope they listened. -Before someone else gets killed? Sinclair. Senator Hidoshi is on Gold Channel. It's about the new budget. On our way. And you don't know of anyone who has one? l'll pay any price. G'Kar! Doing a little shopping, are you? ls that permitted during the holy days of G'Quan? lt's no concern of yours, Mollari. l heard about the mishap involving your transport. Shocking. Truly shocking. lf there is anything l can do to help, you will let me know, yes? No. Well? No one can deliver a G'Quan Eth in time for the ceremony. According to import records, there is one being here who has the flower. -Well, who is it? -Ambassador Mollari. What?! Why does the universe hate me? It's all in the budget report. We need those increases in station operations. Promises were made. Political realities sometimes supersede good intentions. If President Santiago turns things around... ... you may receive some of the money you requested. Our safety concerns won't wait. There's already been an accident. Accidents happen. Our experts assure us that your new budget... ...is more than sufficient for safe and efficient running of Babylon 5. Commander, I have every confidence that you will make it work. l assume the news about the budget has leaked by now. The Business Channel has a detailed analysis. Set up meetings with the guilds. l'll meet separately with Ms. Connally. She'll be mad. The dock workers got zip. No pay raise, no funds for new equipment. The Senate says they're bound by contract. They can't quit and they can't strike. -Commander, we've got a problem. -Surprise, surprise! -The dockworkers are calling in sick. -How serious is it? They aren't ill, they're just calling in sick. -The Blue Flu. -Excuse me? My grandmother told me Boston cops used it to get around strike sanctions. ln other words, we have an illegal strike on our hands. This is Babylon Control. Our docking schedule is being revised. How much more can we take? We need a 1 0-hour turnaround after a double shift! -You're lucky if you get four! -You're lucky if you get any! We break safety rules every day because of overscheduling! l say strike! Strike! Strike! All right, knock it off! Knock it off! Stop it! First, l don't want to hear the word " strike" anymore! We'll hear everyone out, but let's take this one issue at a time. Let's remember to keep a cool head during management negotiations. -What do you want here? -Getting out of my way is a start. lt's all right, Eduardo! Let him through. -What do you got to say? -Let's hear it! l've been expecting you, Garibaldi. Commander Sinclair has requested the honor of your presence twice. -Maybe you didn't get the message. -l've been busy. l got sick workers. You think this is funny? Well, l don't. We're serious, and we want the Senate and Sinclair to know it. With an illegal strike? That's not smart. Sinclair's career military. He won't understand. l figure you're blue-collar under your Earthforce gray. -We're only doing what we must do. -l know, but this isn't the way. -What are our options? -That's what we want to talk about. The hell with your talk! We got people dying out here, Mr. Security Man! Sinclair wants us to talk! Does he think we're fools? All right, all right! Let me handle this, all right? The commander wants to talk, we'll talk. Let's go. -Your friend wants a fight. -That was Eduardo. His little brother was killed in the accident. l've lost someone close. So has the commander. -He wants to help, Neeoma. -We'll see. lf your people don't go back to work, the Senate could invoke the Rush Act. They fear inflaming public opinion here and at home. No, things are changing on Earth. And not for the best. You've made your point. Earth Central will be made aware of your grievances. We can't go back to work without guarantees. l can't guarantee anything if you strike. Every time we trust the Senate, we get kicked. -And what happens when you kick back? -We won't be the first to use force! -l saw them. They're angry! -They have a right to be angry! They have a right to hear me. They will, but we can't return to work. -But the consequences-- -Don't tell me about consequences! My father was killed during mining strikes. l've spent my life defending workers' rights. l won't stop. Get us decent pay and equipment and more workers. Then we return to work! Not a minute before. Sinclair. You've got another transmission from Senator Hidoshi. Patch it through. You left your door unlocked. Careless of you. l thought it best to sit and guard your room until you returned. And did you find anything of interest in my humble quarters. . . . . .while you were guarding it? -No. -No? Care for a drink? Oh, l forgot. The days of G'Quan forbid it. But they come to a close very soon, do they not? You know why l'm here. The G'Quan Eth plant, yes? Difficult to grow, expensive to transport. . . . . .very expensive to own. . . . . .but so very important to you at this festive time. l understand you are in possession of G'Quan Eth. lf this is so, l am here. . . . . .to purchase it. Ever since we left your beautiful planet. . . . . .G'Quan Eth plants have been hard to find. Mine, which is being cared for in a safe place. . . . . .l have been saving for a special occasion. When you drop the seeds into a proper mixture of alcohol. . . . . .whole new universes open up. lt's a shame you Narns waste them, burning them as incense! Name your price! You are asking for quite a sacrifice from me! But, in the interest of interstellar peace and friendship. . . . Fifty-thousand credits, in cash, in advance. -That's an outrage! -Of course it is! The question is, how important is your religious ceremony to you? Commander, we have heard reports... ...of an illegal strike by your Dockers Guild. Those reports are exaggerated. We do have a problem, but l-- This action threatens the security of our military base. It sets a bad precedent for Babylon 5 and all of our off-world interests. We cannot allow that! They have legitimate grievances. l can't just ignore them. You will not have to. The Senate has ordered Orin Zento to Babylon 5. He will be there within 1 2 hours. Zento? He is our best labor negotiator. He has stopped this kind of thing before in other stations. I expect you to give full cooperation. That includes providing troops if he decides the Rush Act is necessary. You're not serious? We have over a thousand dockworkers here. lf we arrest them, we could have a riot. The more reason to end this thing decisively before it spreads! Understood, commander? Understood. . . . . .senator. -Mr. Zento. This way. -Commander. l heard there was an accident on the docks. One killed, and the Narns want reparations for damage to their ship. l hope we can expedite negotiations. l'm on a tight schedule. -When can l meet Connally? -Soon. l'll need your security chief in case l invoke the Rush Act. Have Mr. Garibaldi report to Briefing Room 3. Yes? Ambassador Mollari, I have the money. Fifty thousand credits, in cash. Where is the G'Quan Eth? Actually, G'Kar, l have changed my mind. -The G'Quan Eth plant is not for sale. -What? l've also changed my lock code, so don't bother visiting me. Consider this a small, a very tiny portion of revenge. . . . . .for what you did to our colony on Raghesh 3 and to my nephew! Did you think that l had forgotten that? Ambassador. . . . . .enjoy the last few hours of your festive holiday. l know l will. l'll kill him with my bare hands! There's nothing to stop me! Sinclair can only kick me off the station. He might even thank me. You're not a follower of G'Quan, are you, Na'Toth? My father followed G'Lan. My mother didn't believe in anything. -What do you believe in? -Myself. Too easy an answer. We all believe in something greater than ourselves. Even if it's the blind forces of chance. Chance favors the warrior. ls there nothing you can do to get a G'Quan Eth? Only one more thing, and l hate having to do it. But if that should fail, there's something l want you to do. At your service, ambassador. l assure you, your guild is not being singled out. -Earth sympathizes with your situation. -Sure, Zento! l personally understand your feelings. But the government must cut costs. We're in a recession. Everyone's feeling the pinch. At home and-- The government found enough money for increased military spending. Babylon 5 is a military installation amidst hostile alien governments. lt is vital to the defense of Earth. And your guild is a vital part of Babylon 5. The new budget provides everyone with enough funds. . . . . .to run their departments efficiently. We've cut away the fat, yes. But we've left the muscle and bone. l think we know where the fat went. Ms. Connally. Mr. Zento, you're right. My people are a part of Babylon 5. They built it and keep it running. What do they get for it? They work triple shifts with faulty equipment for pay that's a joke! You signed a contract, like every other worker on this station. Abide by it, we'll fix these problems. These problems killed a man. A damn good man. As head of this guild, l won't let it happen again! We were promised an increase by last year's negotiator. l want to help, but l've seen no written agreement. Without that, my hands are tied. There are simply no funds available. Now despite this unfortunate accident. . . . . .our experts say you have enough people for this year, and that-- How many of those experts ever worked a space dock? Or tried to refuel a ship while being pushed because of overscheduling? Or felt the pain in their bones from operating a zero-G cargo loader? You have a point, Mr. . .? Mr. Eduardo Delvientos, senior foreman. And, yeah, l got a point. l've worked docks for 40 years and this equipment. . . . . .won't last two months. lt needs to be overhauled, but we don't have the money. lf you won't do nothing about it, get your experts to run those docks. lf that's your response, you leave me no choice but to invoke the Rush Act! ls that what you want? l suggest we recess for the evening. We're all tired. lt's not a good time for big decisions. You're right, commander. Ms. Connally, perhaps we'll have better luck at a private meeting. Shall we say 7? He's bluffing. The Rush Act hasn't been invoked since Europa. Don't count on that. l told you things are changing. One thing hasn't changed. The workers always get shafted. -But this time, we'll fight back. -Keep cool, or we're finished. -We have a right to defend ourselves. -Not with violence. Beg your pardon, but if someone's pushed you, wouldn't you push back? l hope we make more progress tomorrow. You better tell that to Zento. Cargo ship Seattle, please hold. You're next on the schedule. -Computer, what time is it? -0536. -Yes? -What the hell is going on? The Dockers Guild dropped their Blue Flu story. They've officially declared this a strike! Damn! l'm sure it's just a rumor. lf you'll give me some time-- Don 't play games with me. I know all about you. You let this situation escalate. The Senate will get a full report! We have contracts to honor! -We're talking about people's lives. -Spare me the platitudes. I'll meet with Ms. Connally. But if she persists, the Rush Act will be put into force... ...and your troops had better be ready to enforce it! Now what? Yes? I must speak to you immediately on a matter of grave importance! l have an emergency situation on my hands! I wouldn 't want to burden you further... ...by taking this matter up before a full assembly. All right, l'll meet you in the council chambers. All ships, please stand by. All docking bays are full. This is about a flower? Not just a flower. The very symbol of my faith. All followers of G'Quan perform a yearly ritual. . . . . .when our sun rises behind the G'Quan mountain. We must acquire a new plant for the ceremony. l made all the arrangements. lt should have been here months ago. This must sound ridiculous. No, it doesn't, but we'll have to talk some other time. Commander, there is no other time. We perform the ritual in the first rays of sunlight. . . . . .that shine past the mountain. Those who can't be there must still perform the ritual at the same moment. lt is our most important observance and requires the G'Quan Eth. . . . . .which, as the ranking member of my faith here, l must provide. l truly sympathize, but it's Londo's to do with as he likes. lt's sacrilege for him to possess it. lt was stolen from us! l'll make an incident out of this! l don't like threats, but l'll do what l can. Look, l can't force you to do this. . . . . .but for interstellar goodwill, as well as peace and quiet, l'm asking. You know l would do anything for you, my good friend. . . . . .but not this! You don't have to give him the G'Quan Eth. He'll pay you. This isn't about money or spiritual beliefs. G'Kar is only worried about losing face. The Narns. They're a barbaric people. They're all pagans, still worshiping their sun. No, l would rather burn the plant than give it to him. -Would you at least consider it? -No. -Well? -l'm sorry. But, commander-- Sinclair. You're wanted in the briefing room. On my way. Na'Toth? Proceed. -When will you be reasonable? -When you are. l don't know why you're being so difficult. Every other guild signed an agreement. They know we're not a pool of money! l don't care if they've agreed to wear bunny suits! We won't put up with this treatment! lf you won't negotiate, we have no choice! -This is a waste of time! -Mr. Zento, Ms. Connally. Surely some kind of accommodation can be made to end this peacefully. -l've gone over the budget-- -We don't accommodate illegal strikers! -Damn it! -Take budget problems to the Senate! Ms. Connally, l strongly recommend you send your people back to work now! Stuff it! l refuse to pander to these people. l'm invoking the Rush Act now. -You need Senate confirmation! -l'll have it! l'll expect Mr. Garibaldi to be ready to arrest Ms. Connally. . . . . .and any other worker who persists in this illegal activity! l have to warn my people. -Damn it, can't you stop this now? -lt's too late for that. My workers are tired. They've been pushed too far. You know what could happen if l have to order Garibaldi in. The same thing that happened on Europa and at Matewan. The same thing that always happens when laborers rise up. They try to break us, we fight back. Someone will get hurt, maybe killed. For what it's worth, l'm sorry this has to happen here. All bays are full, we cannot accommodate you. We've waited for hours! We're making the strike our lead item. ls it true Zento declared it an illegal strike. . . . . .and seeks approval for the Rush Act? -No comment. -We have a convoy on the way. They'll have to wait. You and your guards can kiss my codpiece! Commander, this creature is a thief. l demand you arrest him at once. l'll tear your pale throat out! He stole the statue of our god from the Centauri Cultural Center. l've been with many witnesses! l have not stolen anything! Then it was your attack dog Na'Toth! -l'm fed up with your fabrications! -Any comment? -l demand you arrest him! -Arrest him! That's enough! Get the hell out of here. All of you. Now! Lt. commander, in 1 0 seconds, escort any unauthorized persons to the brig. Yes, sir! Ten, nine, eight, seven. . . -l'm filing a protest! -. . .six, five. . . -The public has a right to know! -. . .four, three. . . . Two, one. So, what'd l miss? Call from Senator Hidoshi. l'll take it here. -Zento has created an uproar! -He has a knack for that. I believe you should be able to handle this as you see best. Unfortunately, Mr. Zento has convinced the Senate otherwise. They have invoked the Rush Act... ...declaring the situation on Babylon 5 an illegal strike. You're ordered to move in with your troops and end it now. -No negotiations. -This will only end in violence! I know that, and I fear that's exactly what some people are hoping for. Sorry, commander. Get your people ready. Full tactical alert. Lt. commander, l need to see the full text of the Senate order. Yes, sir. The Senate has invoked the Rush Act... ...in their dispute with the dockers. Replacements are reporting to launch centers.... Be careful and watch each other's backs. Shut that thing off. lt's going down. Everybody remember: We just gotta keep cool. -They're coming! -Let them come! -Come to do your master's bidding? -You know why l'm here. Yeah, maybe you're looking for an honest job! l'm gonna ignore that. You're all under arrest. Don't make me do it the hard way. There is no other way. So get to it, or get out of here. What's happening? Give the word, we'll pump in gas and arrest them. -l wanted to avoid this. -Me too. Your guy Delvientos threw the first punch. Eduardo's not a violent man. Alberto was the last of his family. You must let me talk to them. -Why aren't the docks cleared? -l was gonna do that. lnstruct your men to pull back to Blue Sector. lf you and Ms. Connally will join me. -What do you need me there for? -You'll see. Pull back to Blue Sector! Yeah, chalk one up for the dockworkers. Yeah. We did it, all right. Here they come again! l hope you know what you're doing. Quiet down! Hear him out! Under the Rush Act, the Senate has empowered me to end this strike. l'm authorized to use any means necessary. Correct? Yes. Any means necessary. -Am l assured of your support on this? -Absolutely. Then under that authority l choose the following means to end the strike. One: l'm re-allocating 1 .3 million credits from the military budget. . . . . .to begin upgrades of all dockside equipment. . . . . .and to start hiring additional workers. Two: Two: l'm declaring amnesty for any striking worker or representative. . . . . .who has committed no other crimes during this period. That's you, kid. You can't do this! l couldn't. Till you convinced the Senate to invoke the Rush Act. Never hand someone a gun unless you're sure where they'll point it. One minute. As for the incident earlier, with Mr. Garibaldi's approval. . . . . .no charges will be pressed. l figure my people will call it a fair fight if yours are. That's my offer. lt's dependent on you returning to work immediately. Babylon 5 has cargo to move. You heard the man. Okay, you dock rats, let's get back to work! You twisted the intent of that order, and you won't get away with it! Ms. Connally said it best the other day. Stuff it! l underestimated you. l'm sorry, and thank you. We'll catch hell over this down the road. My dad said, " There are no happily ever afters, just new battles. " -Garibaldi. -Ms. Connally. -l'll see you around. -A pleasure. No offense, commander. . . . . .but you look like week-old bread. Get some sleep. That's exactly what l had in mind. Now that we've calmed things down. -Sinclair. -Commander, you better get up here. What is it? G'Kar and Londo are half an inch from killing each other. l've been up for almost two days with no sleep. This makes me cranky. We've noticed. Have you considered meditation? G'Kar, you will return Ambassador Mollari's statue. -But l must protest! To accuse me-- -G'Kar will return the statue! And that is all l ask. That, and his head on a platter. l discovered that the G'Quan Eth had a chemical composition. . . . . .making it a controlled substance. lllegal to have except for legitimate medical or religious purposes. Ridiculous! lt is no more harmful than a bottle of your whiskey. File a protest. . . . . .but you must turn the plant over to me. You'll be compensated. All right, commander. You may have the G'Quan Eth. Thank you, ambassador. l have already gotten my enjoyment from it anyway. Ambassador G'Kar, when you have returned Londo's statue. . . . . .l'll turn the G'Quan Eth over to you and you'll compensate Londo. Why should l turn it over. . . . . .assuming that l knew where it was, when it's too late! He knows that! That's why he gave in so easily. This is performed in the sunlight that's touched the G'Quan Mountain. . . . . .on a particular day and time, right? Yes. As your people went into space, it wasn't possible to be at the mountain. lf we can't, we must still pray at the same moment as those on our planet. You forgot to take into account that sunlight also travels through space. Think about it: This station's 1 2.2 light-years from Narn. That's over 1 0 Narn light-years. The sunlight that touched the mountain 1 0 years ago. . . . . .will reach this station in 1 2 hours. lt's been on a long journey, but it's still the same sunlight. Good enough for you to conduct your ceremony, right? Yes. lt might be. You are a far more spiritual man than l gave you credit for. There are a few Jesuit teachers who might disagree. -l want that statue returned. -l'm sure careful search will find it. l'll see to it immediately. Commander. . . . . .thank you. Computer, hold all transmissions. l'm going to bed. -You have one transmission holding. -Put it through. Senator Hidoshi, l've been expecting your call. Remind me never to play poker with you. Sinclair, you are a hell of a gambler. This time you won. The Senate decided to let your decision on the strike stand. -l'm glad they see it my way. -They do not. But public opinion is on your side. l see. Commander, I admire what you've done there. My great grandfather worked the Kobe Space Docks until he died. I will admit... ... the discomfort you've given some of my colleague pleases me. This is why I'm telling you this: Orin Zento has powerful friends. By embarrassing him, you embarrassed them. Today, you have made new enemies. If I were you, I would watch things very carefully. You are not the most popular person in government circles right now. So, what else is new? The gift of time. The gift of life. The gift of wisdom. The gift of light. For these things, we are thankful. For these things, we pray. For these things, we are thankful. For these things, we pray.
