 The boy is breathing on his own, there are no cardiac issues. But the cranial trauma produced a cerebral hemorrhage, the edema is pressing on the vital centers. We have to operate immediately, I need your consent. But it's a brain operation... - What are the risks? - Various, Prime Minister. He has a vast cerebral haemorrhage, if we don't operate at once... I know what you're thinking and I understand, but there's no time for a second opinion. - The CAT scan speaks clearly. - Where do I sign? Here, madam. At the bottom. We'll keep you informed, it's a very long procedure. Three more specialists are on their way who will assist me. Doctor... Be strong, he's in good hands. Chin up. It'll go fine, you'll see. - It's my fault. - What? How is it your fault? I shouldn't have sent them to my mother, I knew it. I knew I shouldn't have sent them... Sole, don't talk nonsense. It could have happened anywhere, at home... or at school. It's my fault, I'm disgusted with myself. I'm a shitty mother, I palm them off when I can, I never think of them. I never think of them! You've always said you should take the kids away from me. You should have taken them away from me! You're a very good mother. I was getting laid while our son was drowning and you say I'm very good... You say I'm very good. Quiet... Spaghetti parties. Wine. You sleep, you say prayers... Shall we take the statue? Do we want to do a procession? You think you're on a camping trip? I've fucking had it with you! You've endangered a military secret with your conduct! You could be court-martialed for this bullshit! From today, eight hours armed guard duty and you only get in here with my permission. I don't want to hear a pin drop and I don't want to see people praying! You are soldiers before your fucking doubts, before God! You are soldiers and that's all. And do what the fuck I tell you to! Your mother's here with Alma. Alma... Send Alma in. - I don't want to see my mother. - I'll talk to her. Fabrizio. The news broke immediately, everywhere. I'm keeping it under control, there's great solidarity. - You take care of it. - All right. They're operating on him, we must wait. I don't know how it could have happened. I was asleep, I had put them to bed, we'd watched TV. Everything was in order, locked up. He must have gone out by himself... He's all right, Grandma. I saved him, I pulled him out of the water. He spoke to me, it's nothing serious. - Right, Daddy? - Right. - I was brave, wasn't I? - Very brave. Let's go see Mommy. Ginevra, it's best if you wait here. She doesn't want to see me? She's had an attack, she's resting. - Mommy! - Sweetheart, come here. Don't worry, Mommy, everything will be fine. Yes. Shall I send for another sweater? Are you cold? No, no, I'm fine. Let's go sit on the bed. You know, the helicopter made all the deckchairs fly away. Yes. - Ever ridden in a helicopter? - No. Come on. Mommy? I'm so tired, can I go home? - I don't like it here. - We can't go home. They're operating on your brother, we must wait. Let's watch TV. Here. He slipped into the pool, hitting his head... The weather conditions are stabilizing... SAN MICHELE INSTITUTE So, you went to find him without saying anything to anyone? Yes. A horrible man, I nearly... Nearly...? He was about to rape me, I escaped, I don't know how. Do you realize what you did? If there's a chance it's him, we need to know. - We're so close. - The fuck you talking about, Sandra? You trusted some shitty software that matches faces on the internet. To find what? This. We have his DNA, let's test it right away. No, did you hear Votta? "Our job ends here, someone else will take over now." I'm done. We still have no news of the operation, but here at the entrance to the hospital, people are gathering in numbers as a sign of solidarity. They have formed prayer groups, the country is close to its Prime Minister. Today there's no "yes" or "no", there's no warring about the referendum, today we are all here to say "yes" to the life of little Carlo. Wait here. Where are you going? You can talk to me. The operation is still underway... - We'll keep you informed. - Thank you. Nothing for it but to wait. How many are there? Sorry? How many tiles from here to the window? I don't know, fifteen? Twenty. Twenty. I say, twenty. One... two... three... four... five... six.... There are twenty tiles. Come with me. Father Marcello? It's odd, but the most important thing in poultry farming is hygiene. We've dressed you like this because these creatures are delicate, they're prone to infections, which spread easily. - Right, Father Giovanni? - Yes, Sister Mary Celeste. We're a team, we all have a role, we must find the best one for you. In time we'll know if you're more suited to grain or excrement. We believe that starting with simple things, close to nature, is the road that leads back to inner peace. Do not underestimate chickens, they can give you a lot of satisfaction. You can begin with the excrement. Excuse me? Where is my husband? - Wasn't he in the room with you? - No. Where is Marisa? I don't know. - They've both stepped out. - I'll find out where they are. Thank you. Father Giovanni? Come with me. Marcello! May I? Hello, I'm looking for Mr... - Tofi.. - Tofillaro. In the next room. May I? Marisa, come in. Do you know Mr Tofillaro? - Hello. - Pleasure, Vittorio. My mother's getting married, I needed a suit. - Good. - Okay, Vittorio, thank you. Goodbye. Please. How's the boy? Any news? Still nothing. What was so urgent? I can't get away. Last night, two guys entered the pool. What did they see? Nothing, I hope. But that's not the problem, it's the soldiers. They didn't even notice, they've lost the plot. I can't guarantee the security and the secrecy of that place, so I've taken a decision: tomorrow I'll resign and leave. Actually, seeing as it isn't an official posting, I'll just leave. With the Prime Minister in this situation, you'd do that? I'd like to remind you of one small detail, you were the one who called him and advised him. You're both accountable, it's a risk for you. Don't threaten me. I believed in Pietromarchi, but I was wrong. I thought he could deal with this, instead what did he do? He brought in the priest, then the freezer, then he disappeared. Whereas you're always so busy, you haven't even been to the pool. I'm sorry, I have no choice, I'm quitting and releasing the guys from duty. Votta... General... Listen to me: now, Pietromarchi is weak, he hasn't been able to make allies, he's on his way out. He will lose the referendum, but I'm preparing the transition and I'm taking charge of this thing. Meaning? The right way at the right time to show the statue. You treat this Holy Virgin as if she were a package, actually, no, a weapon. Votta, I greatly appreciate what you're doing, I understand the burden you carry. The transition is already underway. Di Giovanni is leading it, and I think that in the future he will need trusted people like you. You see, I'm not like you, unfortunately. Do you want to handle everything? Go ahead. The freezer's small, you'll find a spot for it at your place. That bastard of a bishop and that asswipe Prime Minister wanted to lock me away together with those pedophile priests. But those assholes don't know who they're dealing with. Listen to me: as we speak, unbeknownst to the world, there is a miracle taking place. There's a Holy Virgin weeping blood, they've closed her up in a pool, I am the only one who can free her. But they can't stop me, because God is guiding me and you, too. How did you find me? I put a GPS tracker in your jacket. - GPS? - Yes, like for dogs. I sewed it into your jacket lining. Good idea... Hang on a minute, I don't get it... Am I your runaway dog? And you're my mistress? No, I was worried... How fucking dare you? Look, I saved you, I drove 300 kilometers to come and find you! And this is how you treat me? Don't call me your angel, if this is how you treat me. - I'm maltreating you? - Yes. There's no other way, you have to be maltreated. Where are you parked? I have to get to Rome immediately. I don't know. It all looks the same here. Good evening, Prime Minister. We have orders not to let anyone in. Here I am. I'm here. Take me, but leave my son alone. Nothing... Nothing... What the fuck are you? What kind of god takes it out on a child? What kind of miracle is this? This is not God. All you can do is weep blood... What good are you? You don't do a fucking thing, you don't help anyone. You leave everything the way it is. What are you telling me? What do you want? Tell me. Tell me what to do and I swear I'll do it. You want me to show you? I'll show you to everyone. Save my son and I'll show you to everyone. I'll take you to St Peter's. Tomorrow, I'll bring in the media. I'll take you to the Pope! I'll bring the whole world to you. I beg you, I beg you, look at me... God, I beseech you, save my son. He's a good boy, he hasn't done anything. He's a good boy. Please, God, help me. He's only a child... Mommy. Come and lie down in the room a while. Forgive me, my darling. I know it wasn't your fault. Here! No, you keep it. No way, no arguments. - Please, Marcello. - No. Come on. There, come on. Easy. Listen, if you don't want to take the meds anymore, fine, but I read on the internet that in Geneva they're doing experiments. - I spoke to a doctor. - Why? What? Why are you doing all this for me? Do you remember when we made love at Misefari? And you told me you wanted to become a priest and I didn't believe you? Twenty-one days later, you entered the seminary and I didn't hear from you anymore. I wrote you a letter, but you never replied. What was I supposed to say? You had discovered the Absolute and I discovered I was pregnant. They locked me away in Misefari until I had the baby. I didn't tell them who the father was. Then they gave him to some relatives I didn't even know. Have you never met him? No. How old is he? He'll be 35 on May 18. It's not him. - Are you happy? - It couldn't have been him. Now let's compare our data with the DNA databanks, starting with the prisons. Sure, now it could be an inmate's blood... No, but we need to rule that out. Then on to the medical databanks? Anyway, we know this blood does not have any major genetic disease. But who says it's from the present day? From someone who's alive now and not 200 years ago or in 200 years? So far, this blood does not have a body. You mustn't look at the blood, but at what's in it. If this miracle is happening now it's because we have the technology, the knowledge to understand it now. I think that this miracle is a message for us. - Us, who? - You and me. Come on... - We extracted DNA? - Yes. - That DNA must belong to a man. - Sure. Only twenty years ago, it would have remained a miracle. But that statue isn't a miracle today. That statue is a vector for the DNA of the new man and it's up to both of us to find it. I'm certain the owner of that blood exists. And what if inside that person there were something evolutionary? Something necessary for the improvement of the human species? Are we looking for the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who? - And where will we find him? - I don't know. Can I ask you something? Why don't you just let it go? There are mysteries that it's better not to investigate. I think the exact opposite. We must be near the road. What's wrong? I don't feel well. Get up. Get up. - I can't. - Yes, you can. We're almost there, come on. You go on ahead, don't worry. I'll rest for a minute, then I'll catch you up. Where will you catch me up? Come on, I'll help you. I can't make it. Come on! I'll stay here with you. We'll wait for it to get light. Okay, Marcello? Grandma, come see. What are they doing? Praying? Yes. For Carlo? Yes. He's dying... No, he's not dying. Come, let's pray, too, I'll teach you how. Kneel down. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. "Hail Mary, full of grace... Our Lord is with thee... Blessed art thou among women..." You can't die, Marcello. You are immortal, because I chose you. Come and take me. Come, Marcello. Save me. Mommy. Dad. He's gonna be alright... Excuse me. Sole. Don't touch me. - May I speak to you? - We have nothing to say. - Please. - Let go of me. Where have you been? Where have you been? I've been looking for you everywhere. You even switched off your phone! Where the fuck have you been? What's more important than your child dying? - Will you let me speak? - The referendum, an interview? You're a piece of shit. - Let me speak. - No, I won't let you speak! You don't care about me, you left us alone, you neglect us! I don't neglect you. I do not neglect you. Oh, God... I don't neglect you. This time, I'm not going to make it, please, don't leave me on my own. I beg you, don't leave me on my own... The operation is over, it lasted eleven hours. Little Carlo has a sturdy constitution. From a surgical point of view, the procedure was a success, but we have to wait for him to wake up before we can take him off the danger list. But I can say he is breathing on his own. And that's a miracle. The next few hours will be decisive. Thank you, everyone.
