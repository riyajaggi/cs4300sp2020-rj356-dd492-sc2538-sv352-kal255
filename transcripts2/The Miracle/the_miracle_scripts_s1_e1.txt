 THE MIRACLE THE CONSERVATION OF MATTER DAY ONE Ten "Diamond Cascades", twenty "Vacations for Life", six "Heaps of Cash". How many "Diamond Cascades"? Ten. Two weeks from the most important referendum in Italian political history, it is not a given that Italians want to stay in the EU.

 Polls suggest Prime Minister Pietromarchi no longer comes across as the strong man capable of saving the Union, am I right? "Strong man" is a term I don't care for, it conjures up an ugly chapter in our history that is behind us. It's not important whether the Prime Minister is strong or not, Italians must make a... Yes, I got it. Very well, General, I'll tell him. Can't you give me a heads up? Let me know. Sole, nearly ready? What are you doing? Nothing. It's late.

 Look, I'm ready. Ready? All done, I've done my makeup, I just have to put on my dress. - I want to show you something. - We're late. Hold on, just a moment. They've been like that for a quarter of an hour. What do you think they're doing? - They're playing. - Does it seem normal to you? Kids their age are glued to their cell phones, ours just hum. Come on, get your dress on and let's go. Asia? Marcello! What are you doing here? Look at the state you're in. Listen, you got any spare change? Get in, I'll take you home. Take me to the subway. So, Marcello, you got some cash? No. You blew it all on scratch cards. You're out of it, you haven't even scratched them all. Will you give 'em to me? Behave. Put them back. I get it, let me get out here. I'll take you to your mother's. Marisa, who put Falconieri on TV? - It was her turn. - Who gives a shit about turns! Is it normal that she says it doesn't matter if I'm strong or not? Votta called... - Votta? - The general, head of intelligence. He said he wants to see you. What's happened? A delicate matter, you'd better go. Change of plan, there's an emergency. - Serious? - I don't know, but dinner's off. - I'll send D'Argenzio and his wife. - I'll go. - By yourself? - Sure. How come? I'm wearing this gorgeous Capucci gown, I look fabulous in it. - I do look fabulous in it, right? - Absolutely. I'll go. If I finish early, I'll join you. Why are we here, Marcello? So, you're hooking now? I'm strung out, Marcello. I tried to stop, but I can't, I don't want to go back to rehab. So, you want some money? Yeah. Then show me how you hold it. Squeeze. Squeeze. You can't even give a fucking hand job? Don't look at me or I'll kill you. - Marisa, is everything okay? - Yes. Give my apologies to the ambassador and tell Di Giovanni I'll call him as soon as I can. - Reassure him. - I'll take care of it. How's Sole doing? Please, keep an eye on her. Yes, don't worry. - She looks stunning tonight. - Is he checking up on me? No! Look at her! Who? Her dress is identical to mine! Marino, stop! We have to go back, I need to change. No, you're not going home, they're all expecting you. Nobody will notice. Nobody will notice? You're out of your mind! Tomorrow it'll be a headline, I'm not going dressed like this. Sole, please. - Marino, are the windows tinted? - Of course, madam. - What are you doing? - That's a cute blouse. No! Go on! No, stop it! I can see you, Marino. I'll look like a bedside lamp in that dress. Madam. Sole, smile. Give us a nice smile. Over here. Good evening. Good evening. - Prime Minister. - General. What's going on? I'll show you. It's better if it's just you. Wait here. I don't get it. Come, let's not talk here. Excuse me. I stopped once, 14 years ago. - Do you smoke? - No, thanks. So... What's that trick? There's no trick. You're telling me that statue is weeping blood for real? Nine liters an hour. Is this a joke? Is it one of those shows where they prank people? No. Right, so... You found it in the Mafia boss Molocco's bunker? Yes, the guy behind the Catanzaro courthouse massacre. Who kept it in his kitchen... - Where did he find it? - He won't say a word. Do you realize what you're saying? There has to be a little pump, a tank. A chemical reaction, or some kind of technology. A trick. Or else, what is it? Is it a miracle? Thank you. This is a very special evening. There's a full moon and I've decided to dedicate to Sole Pietromarchi, Italy's splendid first lady, a song that's rather unusual in my repertoire: "Song of Love" by Carlo Rustichelli. Mrs Pietromarchi, I like your style. Thank you. It's obvious you're different, you're genuine, not like the other first ladies. I get you: you don't give a damn about these people. You're the first lady, but you could easily be an explorer. You know that real life is somewhere else. - Can I ask you something? - Go ahead. Why are you being so familiar? Maybe because you and I are the same. Or am I wrong? First we X-rayed it, then we did a CAT scan, they showed that the object is solid, inside it's all plastic. The blood comes out in two points where the tear ducts would be. It's a fact, there's nothing but plastic inside that statue. - You are? - Guido Saraceni, I'm a chemist. I've analyzed the material the statue's made from, it's plain old polyethylene: plastic. It appears to have been left out in the open. I found signs of weathering, discoloration from rain. Tell the Prime Minister what you told me about physics. One of basic principles of physics is the law of conservation of mass: nothing is created or destroyed, everything is transformed. Here, however, matter would appear to be created from nothing. I'll simplify it. Imagine squeezing an orange, the juice will always weigh less than the orange itself. Never exceed it. So far, since we've been here, a statue that weighs two kilos and 300 grams has produced more than 600 liters of blood. The laws of physics don't apply to this statue. Prime Minister... - What is it? - The plasma analysis. What does it say? It's human blood. Male. Type 0. It's not infected, there are neither viruses, nor bacteria. The blood count is within normal range. The calcium's a bit low and so is the azotaemia. It's male blood, why male? If the Holy Virgin is weeping, then it ought to be female blood. I don't know, Prime Minister. Are we really talking about the sex of a statue? As soon as we've mapped the DNA, we'll know more... About what? About whose blood it is, about the statue or about the Holy Virgin? About the Holy Virgin? Yes. Excuse me, guys, but I need a coffee. Prime Minister... This way. Holy shit. Di Giovanni. Lovely evening, isn't it? Where is he? Scared to face me? Something came up. At this hour? What happened? I can never get through to him, I've been asking for a meeting for weeks. I know that, you're at the top of his agenda. Paolo, do you trust me? No one dares to make a pass at me. I knew it the moment I set eyes on you that you're a slut. Here, we're going home now. You're tired, huh? Have you seen my money? It was here. - Give me my money. - What money? - It was here. - That's mine. That's my money! Have you seen that? Give me my money. Piece of shit! - Here. - Thank you. Whose place is this? Confiscated property, rigged contracts. A safe place, for a while. The guys sleep in tents? Yes, I've set them up here. And you? I'm upstairs, in the pool. - Are you a believer? - Yes. I'm not practicing. But I believe. You? No. Of course. How are we going to play this? If what you say is true, it doesn't concern me. It concerns the Vatican, the Church. It's up to the Pope or whoever decides, what to do with it. It doesn't concern me. May I give you some advice? Go ahead. Ponder your decision carefully. If the Vatican released the news, you'd have serious public-order problems. Think of the pilgrims who'd arrive: millions in just a few days. At a time when Italy risks leaving the EU. Religious wars... This becomes a problem of national security. It can't be released like that. Do you want to sleep with Mommy? Hey, sweetheart? See you tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night. Good morning, actually. Thank you for everything you're doing. I knew all along. What? That you were a good person. I voted for you. We can trust them, they won't violate secrecy. Shall we go to bed, too? We'll talk about it tomorrow. Whatever happens keep me updated. Of course, good night. Now then, Molocco... I'm tired, all right? I want to sleep. Tell me, who gave you that statue? Where did you find it? When did it start weeping? - Buenos dias, madam. - Hi, Jolanda. I'll be off, then. - How did the night go? - All good. - See you later. - Bye. So it is written in the book of Romans: "Those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, those who live according to the Spirit, set their minds on the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death. But to be spiritually minded is life and peace. But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you." Thus, brethren, we are not beholden to the flesh, to live according to the flesh, because if you live according to the flesh, you will die. But if, through the Spirit, you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. Therefore, I say to you... walk according to the Spirit, and you will not be led to satisfy the desires of the flesh.
