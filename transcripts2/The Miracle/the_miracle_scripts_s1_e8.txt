 We only have to pick a church and where we are to accompany him. As for the church, I don't know yet. But afterwards, he'll go... to the cemetery at Prima Porta, my family plot is there. - Will you see to it? - Naturally. No! - What? - Carlo is going to Fontana Alta. Prima Porta is the saddest place in the world, Fontana Alta has a wonderful view. It's too far away, we have to keep him close to us. I said no. He'll be there with my family. Alma? He's not here.

 - What? - Alfredo Franco. He can't sleep without Alfredo Franco. Hold on, I'll help you. Wait. Where is he? Where is Alfredo Franco? Maybe he's still at Grandma's. I'll send Marino to get him. We have to put him in the coffin. Yes... I'm sorry, sweetheart. Get ready now, we have to go soon. I'll send Luciana in, all right? When did she write this? October 2007. 2007? She was still well in 2007. Yes, I remember when she came in. This decision puzzled me, actually. What's more, she asked me not to say a word to anyone. In all sincerity, I can't say she wasn't sound of mind. Would you consider sound of mind someone who's never had a pet and who leaves everything to an animal shelter? I don't know what to say, it's odd. Odd, yes. I took the liberty of asking her to reconsider her decision, some months later, I thought you had fought. But your mother was adamant. She was a very determined woman, as you well know. So not even the house? You're still entitled to your rightful share by law, that is inalienable. The operation appeared to have been successful, then little Carlo... During the night, little Carlo left his bedroom and went to the swimming pool, where he slipped and fell. Carlo was suddenly struck down by an embolism... tearing him away from the love... No, that's too rhetorical. I have something important to say. - I have something important to say. - Wait! Call the Prime Minister. Pietromarchi's daughter is here, she wants to speak. I'm Alma Pietromarchi, Carlo's sister. I wanted to say... that it's my fault that Carlo died. It's all my fault, I should go to jail. I killed my brother. If I hadn't thrown his cube into the pool, he wouldn't have gone in. Fuck! Fabrizio! Fuck! Alma! Stop! Just one question! Prime Minister! Put her down here. Calm down... Calm down. Easy. Breathe. - Breathe. - Wait for me here. Calm down, sweetheart. This is a winner. There's a car waiting out back. I had them cordon off the area. - No one will disturb us. - Wait, wait. We'll be right back, we're just out here. Come. What is it? It's best if you don't come to the funeral home. What do you mean, I don't come? You can go on your own, I'll see you directly at the funeral. It's over, Fabrizio. Carlo's dead, Alma will never get over today. That image of her in front of the media, what she said... she'll carry it all her life. We should have separated two years ago, when it was the right time. You insisted and I was wrong, I don't know whose fault it is anymore. We've destroyed everything. I can't be with you anymore. Listen to me, Sole... Sole, look at me. You can do whatever you want, whatever you want, but don't leave me on my own right now. Now we have to be together, we have to help each other. We have to stay close to our daughter. - We can't help each other anymore. - Yes, we can. - I don't have the strength to help. - Yes, you do. I beg you. Alma? Darling, come, we have to go. Say goodbye to Daddy. Come along, little one. Off you go. Just do me one favor: keep those monsters away from us. I don't want to see them, they're your thing. Hi. Hi. Where are you going dressed like that? I'm going to visit my mother. How are you? Are you all right? - You want me to drive you? - No. Don't worry, get some more sleep. Remember we have a flight to Geneva at 5:12? Yes, I know. Marcello? Where will we meet? At the check-in. Then, I'll go there. - And wait for you. - Okay. Do what you have to do, I'll be there. Okay. Fabrizio? - Is it all ready? - Ready. You sure about this? You don't have to do it. I want to do it. Do you want me to take a look? No, thank you. I brought this. - What the fuck's that? - Scratch cards, all winners. There's a couple with a thousand euros, it's more than what I owe you. Scratch cards? I dunno... Here, check 'em. But I have to ask you something. I'd like to thank the Italian people for their expressions of sympathy in this terrible time for my family and for me. In my grief, I have felt great and deep affection. Thank you. Carlo was a child who loved life, who was always smiling... We all loved him, but his sister Alma more than anyone. And his death has devastated her. I ask you to take her words as the desperate cry of a devastated child. And to respect her. Today, my heart is broken. If my life as a man ends here, my role as Prime Minister does not. Italy is facing a very important moment for its future. Whether the "yes" or the "no" wins, this country will change forever and I cannot back out of my responsibilities. Despite the grief that grips me, I will not abandon you, as you have not abandoned me. The time to tell you to vote "yes" or "no" is over. Now only your conscience can dictate what is right for you and for your children. Thank you again. Thank you. I brought this for Madam. Grasp it, stretch your arm out. Use your other hand, too. Before you shoot, hold your breath. Go. Marcello, what are you up to? You sure about this? Forgive me for asking, but have you ever been a priest? A real priest? Why? I don't think you're a believer. Just a feeling. - I've never believed more than now. - If you say so... Anyway, we're even now. Who knows if I'll see you again. Or should I look in the paper? The fuck are you doing? Gimme that. Don't you watch movies? The gun goes here. There, so you can't see it. Listen... Do you know an abandoned pool near Laurentino? No, that's not my turf. There's a guy called Florian, he's better than Google Maps. I'll give you his number. Alma, Carlo hasn't gone, now he lives inside us, he's here with us, in our thoughts. That's not true, when you die there's nothing. Like a light that goes out and it goes all dark, you said so yourself. No, it's not like that. I was wrong, I told a lie. You hear me, sweetheart? It's not like that. Alma, sweetheart, can you hear me? Alma? Sandra! Where have you been? I've been looking for you for days! You just left me there with those old ladies, I buried your mother. You could have thrown her in a mass grave for all I care. What's the matter? Maybe your mother wanted... You were right, you always said it. My mother was a bitch. It irritated her when I kissed her, I saw it in the way her mouth tensed. She always tried to avoid contact with my cheek. I spent my life trying to show her I was worthy. I'd do something and she'd say it was the least I could do. Do you know what she said about homosexuals? That they're people who are scared of facing the opposite sex. Weak people. I did things for her, if you only knew... But now it's over, I'm done with her, with my obsessions. This will has to give me the strength to start over. And you're there for me, thank God, you're there. I'll always be there for you... Listen, let's get a place together, big, where we can make a fresh start. - Slow down. - Yes, I've lost too much time. You're good for me. Maybe we should tell Giovanna? Yes, of course. I've been with her for over a year. I mean, with Giovanna it isn't the real thing. I get it, she's cute, but... you're not in love with her. When did you decide that? You know what? You're just like your mother. Exactly the same, just as she didn't see you, you don't see me. I have no intention of leaving Giovanna, I love her. You love her? So, why did you come? - I'm worried about you. - You needn't be. But I do, you're not right in the head. I'm perfectly fine in the head. - What happened with your mother? - What? What did you give her? All this business about the autopsy... You were very clever, you gave her something that doesn't show up. Do you really think I could have killed my mother? - It's not your business. Get out! - I'm not judging you. What would you know? Get out! - You've got to get over it. - Right, I get over you. Get out! Get the fuck out! - Sandra... - Get out! Get out! I want you to leave! Is this the only pool in Laurentino? This is the only pool, it was confiscated. Okay, I'll get out here. See ya, priest. - Father, what do you want? - Open up! Father, put the gun down! What you're hiding in here has nothing to do with the military, your superiors don't have any right to keep her imprisoned here. You know that, it's against God. This miracle belongs to all the faithful and to all those who will acquire faith. Father, lower your gun! This is a gift from the Lord and it will change the destiny of mankind. Who are you to stop it? I must ask you again to halt. I am here to show her to the world and do the Lord's will. I order you to halt, please, lower your weapon. Gun on the ground! You, Godless little cockroaches, do not try to stop me! As is written in Matthew: "I have not come to bring peace, but a sword!" - What have I done? - You did the right thing. Look at me! You did the right thing, you did your job, you saved my life! GENEVA - Excuse me. - Yes? Domestic flights? You need to go to Terminal 1. - Thank you. - Not at all. She's stopped weeping. I wasn't expecting this. Well done. Leave her alone. Put her back. You want her? - Here. - No! Help! Help! Was it a miracle? - Was it or wasn't it? - Yes. - Was it a miracle? - It was a miracle. She's weeping... Is she still weeping? Yes, she's still weeping. Look. She's weeping. Marcello? Hello. Who are you? I'm Clelia. Who are you? Nicolino. Hi, Nicolino. I'm looking for Salvo. Does he live here? He's my dad. Hello. Who are you looking for? Salvo? I was looking for you. ITALY STAYS IN EUROPE INSTITUTE OF ANIMAL GENETICS Dr Lopez? Down there. Sandra, from Italy? Sorry. Pleasure. Do you speak Spanish? I'll be right back. Are you ready? Count to five. One... two... three... Fish? Another one. Calamari. General, we're out of ice. I know where it is, come with me. Rosa, take over. Admiral! Don't trouble yourself. I'll take care of it, go back to the party, Mom's waiting for you.
