 [Maddie] It's way too easy to hurt the ones closest to you. [loon calling] You think you want to know everything about them. [Sarah] I saw Rick again today. He's an interesting guy. Entertaining, not the marrying type. It's been hard to move on, to date again, but I'm doing it. I'm back on that horse. I am so tempted to call John, but every time I hear his voice, my heart sinks. It's not healthy for either of us to continue to drag it on like this. We've made the choice, we have to stick to it.

 I told Rick today what the doctor said. He wasn't happy. I'm so scared. [Maddie] Then you see stuff you can't unsee. It can make you want to break things. And... I think I broke my dad's heart.

 ♪ Unless you get through me, yeah ♪ ♪ You mess with them ♪ ♪ You mess with me ♪ - [Maddie sighs] - [water running] Scout, hurry up. I've got class. Come on, it's disgusting enough having to use the bathroom after you. [John] Guys, you have to... Hey. Hey. [footsteps approaching] I... No, Scout! [banging] [Scout] Snooze, loser! - That's not the expression, dumbass. - [John] Ay-yai-yai. [Scout] I can't hear you over the sound of my peeing in the water. Oh, my aim is off. Oh, my God, you're so gross! [frustratedly] Scout is so annoying! Why are you wearing my shirt? Oh, sorry. Running out of options here, so it was either this or... [laughs] That shirt was a gift from... Mom. I can change. It's fine, just wear it. Okay. [woman sighing loudly] Oh, uh, be careful. - Watch your step right in here. - Okay. [chuckling] Oh, great work, honey. We'll have you up to 5K in no time. [chuckling] Oh. Wow. What a view. [Amanda panting] Breathtaking. This seems like a good spot to... stop and... and get our bearings, catch our breath... not faint. Ha. I'll give you a breather before we tackle Devil's Incline. Hmm? I see a spot to rest. Twenty more yards. [sighs] [Amanda] Devil's Incline? Charming. Who names these things? Usually a relative of the deceased. [laughs sarcastically] That's very comforting. [yelps] Amanda! [yelling] Amanda! It feels like the training around here is getting worse. Just when we should be peaking, it seems like everything's falling apa... West. Better late than never, I guess. So nice of you to join us. Now, gentlemen, what are the three keys to becoming a successful wrestler? - One. - [boys] Work ethic. - Two. - Discipline. Three. - [boys] Mental toughness. - [Jason] Location. Who said that? Scout did. I didn't say squat, dick. Are we allowed to swear, Coach? "Dick" isn't a swear-word, dickhead. Now, the next words out of your mouth, West, are... - The next words out of your mouth are... - I'm sorry, Coach. - Speak up. - I'm sorry, Coach. That's your first warning. Burn. [man on phone] My recommendation, uh, rose pompadour, a shade of pink. Pink? [chuckles] - You have other colors you can...? - [man] Many. - Yeah, send me... send me some pictures. - Of course. Okay, and confirming her birthday again? Her birthday, 12.31.72. Mm-hmm. And that's Sarah? Sarah West? - Sarah. - With an H? Sarah with an H. So our engraving process happens fairly quickly. Okay. Mr. West, we really need to make a decision on the stone before... Yeah. Engraved, yes. - Thank you. - Oh, okay. Well, we'll get pictures to you and take it from there. Okay, I'll give you a... I'll give you a call back, uh, after I look at the pictures. Sound good? - Mm-hmm. Of course. - All right, thank you. [walkie-talkie beeps] - [Sylvie] Sylvie for John. - Go for John. I got a mother and a daughter stuck in the Palisades on a cliff ledge. I'm gonna check on a chopper. Can you head over to see what we're gonna need from the ground? I'm on it. Okay, sending coordinates now. Perfect. [tires squealing] - [bell ringing] - [girls giggling] [Taylor] Hey, guys. - What's so funny? - [woman] Take your seats, everybody. [sighing] I'm not good with this technology. [class laughing] Ha-ha. Yeah, good one, guys. Can someone help me with this, please? I will. I'm trying to connect the phone with the TV. Mm-hmm. - [cartoonish falling sounds] - [class laughing] [woman] Oh, my goodness, Taylor, I'm so sorry. What is this? Who's doing this? Look out, everyone. She's gonna F-A-I-N-T. [laughter] [Coach] Shoot, move your hands. Keep your feet moving, be aggressive. Attack. Get in there, Jason. That's it. That's it, you got him. You got him. You got him. Create space. That's it. Okay, good. Excellent. Excellent defense, Emile. Thank you, Coach. Are you serious? I beat him. Yeah, I'm aware of who won, West. I'm just encouraging his counter-wrestling, that's all. [Jason] Careful, Coach. You might make Scout cry. - You wanna take this outside? - West! That's your second warning now, okay? Smarten up. Go on, give me some push-ups before you get back at it. Here you go. - [woman] Can I get some lemon, please? - Yeah, of course. It's illegal to refuse service to a customer based on prejudice. Listen, did something happen between, "Sure, I'll meet you for dinner, Alex," and our date that I don't know about? Uh, it wasn't a date, and it wasn't intentional. You, on the other hand, manipulating me and holding this signing thing over my head is. [Alex] I'm not the same guy anymore, Charlie. If you'd give me a chance, I could show you that. Or I can just get out of here and we never have to see each other again. Okay. Okay, then. [Maddie] I screwed up. I said I wasn't gonna say anything. But? But he was just so mean to me, I couldn't help it. Are you blaming yourself, or are you blaming him? I don't know. I wanted to keep it a secret, to be the bigger person, but he just kept pushing and pushing, and... he made me tell him. He did it to himself. I'm gonna propose that we work on letting go of blaming anyone here. Deep down, you're both feeling the same hurt. The anger is a symptom. The blame is a symptom. The frustration comes from a loss that you couldn't control. Let's see if we can get to the bottom of what fuels that. I'm Commander John West from TIB Search and Rescue. Uh, Theresa. I'm glad you're here. My daughter Amanda and I were hiking and she just slipped over the ledge. - Okay, show me. - Right there. Right there. All right, stay back. This is not stable down here. [Amanda whimpering] [gasping] [sobs] - [John] Amanda? - Hello? My name is Commander John West of TIB Search and Rescue. This is so embarrassing. Any other complaints? Dizziness, bleeding, broken bones? Yeah, I hate hiking! Get me out of here. The good news is, your hike's over, okay? Better news, we're gonna have you home for dinner. - It's the best news I've heard all day. - [John] Here we go. Oh, thank you. All right, Amanda, I'm coming down for you, okay? Stay calm, we're gonna get you out of here. Please hurry. [John] Rope's coming down, heads-up. - We'll get her out of here. - [Theresa] Okay. Thank you. Here I come, Amanda. Don't worry, I got you. We'll get you out of here, no problem. - Yeah. - Okay. Gonna put you in this harness... we'll be out of here in no time. [whistle blows] [Scout grunting] [blows whistle] - [Scout] Damn it! - [Coach] Good. Let's go again. Coach, let's go again. It's shark bait, West. You lose, you're out. Okay, I slipped, all right? These shoes suck. Best two out of three. All right? Yeah, okay. - Fine, once more, that's it. - Okay. Let's go. - Ready? - [whistle blows] [grunting] [blows whistle] All right. [Jason] That was weak. Best out of five, okay? [Coach] West, you lose, you're out. What's the matter, Daddy's boy can't take a loss? Now I get it. He's a mama's boy. Whoa, whoa. You probably shouldn't say that. His mom just died. I'm sorry... mama's boy. [Scout yelling] [Coach] That's enough! Break it up! Jason, calm down! Calm down! Calm down, all right? That's enough. That's enough. West, strike three. I got half a mind to make you clean out your locker, but I'm gonna let you work it off. Wind sprints, tonight, seven o'clock. Now get out of my gym before I change my mind. Jason! Come here. You think I don't see things? You think I don't hear things? Keep it up... you'll be next. Can I have five minutes? Five minutes, that's all I ask. I have three cakes to make. [clears throat] Fine, I'll help. Listen, Charlie... - [sighs] - Charlie, just... Just hear me out, okay? And then I'll sign and leave, I promise. Five minutes. - [Lara] It was good work today. - [Maddie] Thanks. And, uh, don't forget to - write it all down! - Write it all down, I know. [Lara chuckles] Oh, hello. Hi. [hip-hop playing over stereo] Guys, I told you, I can't hang out. I'm already grounded for a week, I can't make it a month. Yeah, okay, it's fine. Let us just escort you home. You know, make sure you don't get into anymore trouble. - Yeah. - [Maddie] No. - I can't. - [Gwen] Really? Okay. [engine starts] - [horn honking] - [Gwen] Get in the car. We'll get you home quicker. - [honking repeatedly] - Get. In. The. Car. Your dad will be happy. - Oh, my God, okay. - Perfect. ♪ Special delivery I got it if you waited ♪ ♪ It's amazing how I made it out of all the mazes ♪ ♪ My creation's entertaining Shout-out goes to Naismith ♪ Thanks for the ride, guys. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. [engine shuts off] No, no, no, guys, I was serious about not being able to hang out. Oh, yeah. No. it's fine. I just have to use the washroom. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Really fast. - Okay, fine, but just the washroom. - Yeah. Stop. Is that a penguin? Oh, my God, that is not a penguin. - Hi. Hello. - [Maddie] Yeah, this is Tux. - Careful, she bites thieves. - Oh, funny. Oh! [laughs] And their accomplices. [Amanda breathing shakily] [John] Okay. We're almost done with this. Okay, ready? We're gonna turn you around real slow. Breathe, and don't look down. Look out. Turn around. Breathe. Breathe, okay? I'm just gonna tighten up this harness, and we're gonna get you out of here. [Amanda whimpers] Know any good jokes? Um... Sure, uh... What do you call a dog that can do magic tricks? I give up. A Labracadabrador. [laughs] That's a good one. My wife would love that one. [Amanda] I like her sense of humor. Yeah, well, you would. Her name was Sarah. She passed away a couple of months ago. I'm sorry. Yeah. We got three great kids. I'm sure they're really proud of you. [scoffs] I don't know about that. It's tough being the dad and the mom, you know? Dropping the ball all the time. Missed the spelling bee, my daughter just got arrested... again. Get my ascender. Okay... here we go. One step at a time. You're with me? - [John] Here we go. - Yeah. Here we go. - [Amanda yelling] - [John] Whoa, whoa, whoa. - [Amanda whimpering] - [John] You're fine. I got you. Uh... [Maddie] I thought you guys were only here to use the bathroom. Oh, come on, loosen up, Maddie. Your dad's already pissed off at you, so, what do you have to lose? - I mean, it's faulty logic, but I'm in. - Me too. [sighs] [cartoonish falling sounds] [Taylor sniffles] [Henry] So, Captain Maddie, about that three-hour tour... are you gonna let me make it up to you? A date do-over. A reset, if you will. I mean, yeah, sure, but it really wasn't that bad. Oh, yeah? You were totally adorable. You know, there's something I've been wanting to say to you, and I couldn't really muster up the... Oh, my God, it's been over an hour? - An hour? - You guys have to go. I can't afford for my dad to be pissed at me. - Yeah, okay. - Where's Gwen? I have a strong feeling that we shouldn't leave her alone with Tux. [camera clicking] Oh, my God, she's posing. Oh, my God, so cute. [Gwen] Oh. - Sorry. - Hi, handsome. Hi. - Gwen. - Scout. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. [Amanda whimpering] Theresa! Yes? I need you to help me out, okay? [Theresa] What can I do? Amanda's a bit nervous. I can't use the ascender. Go back to my rig. In the front passenger seat - is a remote control for the winch. - Okay. I need you to lift us out of here, okay? Yes, sir. I can do this. Hey. We're gonna be out of here in no time, okay? Hold on tight. All right? Give it a second, we'll be out of here. [winch whirring] [John] Here we go. Here we go. Watch your feet. Watch your feet. Watch your feet. Okay. Gwen. Gwen. Shut the door. - Are you...? - Shut the door! Sorry. Gwen. Gwen. Henry? Argh! I love watching you work. Look... I'm sorry I didn't handle things the right way. - I think we were both confused and... - [timer beeping] I wasn't confused. You made your priorities pretty clear. Alex wants what's best for Alex. Charlie's always been what's best for Alex. Please. Why do you say that? Why? I know I wasn't perfect, but do I deserve this? I mean, was I that awful to you? 'Cause I... 'Cause I always thought we were pretty great together. [exhales] Why did you leave? - I had to travel. I... - No, no, I don't mean physically. I mean emotionally. Why did you leave? What was different that last time... that made you leave? Do you remember? Exactly. - [Scout] Whoo-hoo! - [Gwen] Whoo! Hey! Whoo! Oh, Gwen. [Henry] Got to put a bell on this girl. [Maddie chuckles] What's up with your arm? Oh, it's a hazard of my profession. Well, you should probably try thinking of a new career path. What do you do? Wrestling. - Ooh. Does it pay well? - No. No, it doesn't. And I have a psychopath for a teammate who has it out for me. Treats me like his punching bag, makes it look like it's my fault. - Nice. - Yeah, it's good. Oh, crap, what time is it? Oh, yeah, I got to get my gym bag and go back to school. - Right now? - Yeah. - Coach has me doing penalty practice. - Oh, screw that. Don't go. Trust me, I don't want to, but... Well, I mean, why would you? Are you a masochist? Why jump at the command of someone who lets you get beat up and then punishes you for it? I say you bail. I mean, what's the worst that could really happen? They're not gonna kick you off the team. Look at you. What do you bench? - One-fifty. - See, you're like a coach's dream. Hell, you're like my... - Oh. Well... - Mm-hmm. I say you grow a pair and stand up for yourself. And if you don't have a pair, it's fine. Give me five minutes, Henry does not use his. Oh, my God, there you are. Okay, party's over, time's up. Let's go. I feel like everyone in this family really needs to lighten up, and it's my destiny to help out. It's... it's my Gwestiny. [giggles] [clears throat] - Scout, close your mouth. - What? Hmm? Seriously, Gwen, if my dad comes home and finds you guys here, I'm dead. Maddie, I left already and then Scout invited me back. He's not grounded, so technically, you are not in trouble. Ah, you know, that is a really goo... Terrible, awful point. Why would she say that? It's her Gwestiny, okay? Seriously. It's fascinating how stupid you think our father is. Maddie, calm down, all right? I got your back. Dad's not gonna be home for a little bit. We got a few hours. - You're such a worrywart. - [laughing] Hey, it's okay, I'm sure they have a cream for that. - This is not a joke. Seriously, guys. - It's funny. It's funny. None of you are in trouble. Ah! [all yelling] - Are you kidding me?! - [Henry] Hey, no, no! No! Why would you do that? - [Henry] Stop it! - [Scout] Okay. - Whoa, easy. - Come on! Maddie! No, no! [laughs] [Henry] Give it here. [Maddie squeals] - [Maddie] Oh, my God! - That's what happens. Get out of here! [Henry] Get her! She started it! - She started it! - Get off! [Coach] That's it, girls. You're doing great. You're doing great! Okay, well, that's too bad. All right, bring it in! [blows whistle] When we lost the baby, you bailed on me... like I was some... random girl you knocked up. Random girl? When you were pregnant, it was the happiest time of my life. Don't rewrite history. [sighing] I didn't know what to do. You were in so much pain. You know, I've always been able to fix things... but this... this I couldn't. And I hated myself for it. All I've ever been good at is hockey. It's all I could think to do. You left me... alone. I was bedridden for months, Alex. You know, my sister, she left her entire family to come and take care of me, because she was scared that if she didn't, I may die. It was the single most horrific thing I have ever been through in my entire life, and you were just gone. You vanished. Did you even think about me? About him? Every single day. Look, I couldn't bring him back... and every time you looked at me, it felt like you resented me for it. Like I reminded you of... of what we lost. Because I needed you. You were all that I had left. Well, it was painful for me too. [Charlie sniffling] I know. I know. Come here. Hey. Listen, I tried calling. I did, but you never answered. I thought your message was clear, so I left you alone. Look at me. Baby, I never stopped loving you. Ever. [timer beeping] I got to... get these out. Jan's... not back yet with my car. So... Well, I can drive you. I don't mind. Okay. - [ball banging] - No! - [Scout] Hey, no spinsies. - [Henry laughing] Okay, who is ready for another amazing Gwen idea? Oh, no. Truth or dare? - I'm not playing. - Huh. - Okay, fine, yeah. - Yeah, come on. Hey. Okay, um... truth. Okay. What is the most exciting thing you've done today? Well, I skipped practice. Oh, boo, we already knew about that. Boring. I didn't. Scout, Dad's gonna kill you. Okay, calm down. You worrywart. Are you kidding me? - [Scout] All right! All right! - Okay. [laughing] [Henry] All right, let's calm down. Scout, you pick who goes next. - Henry. - Yeah? Truth or dare? Truth. What is the weirdest part of your body? Hmm. - I got an outie belly button, I guess. - Oh, that is weak. - [Scout] Weak, man. - You can for sure do better than that. Okay. I think Maddie is pretty amazing. - Ew. - Okay, uh, Maddie, truth or dare? Uh, dare. Hmm, okay. I dare you to kiss Henry. - Gwen, what? No. - No way. No. Oh, I am so sorry. Rules are rules, girls are cruel, so pucker up, buttercup. Forget it. Okay, I'll sweeten the pot. If you do it, I will leave right after. Promise? Oh, Scout's honor. [slaps leg] [Scout] Wow. [both clear throats] Amazing. Great job, guys. - Ten out of ten performance. - Awesome. - When's the wedding? - Real special stuff. - Okay. - [Gwen laughing] - [Scout] Last one. - Stop! [walkie-talkie beeps] [John] John to base, come in. The chopper's still about an hour out. Over. All right, Sylvie, we're already up top. Tell Fairfield we won't need further assistance. No significant bleeding or broken bones, some scrapes and bumps. I'm gonna bring her in to get her checked out in the ER. Copy. Nice work, boss. This might sting a bit. - [spraying] - Ah! - [gasping] - Okay. It's okay. It's okay. You almost made it to Devil's Incline the hard way. I recommend you take a little break from hiking for the time being. - You hear that, Mom? A break from hiking. - Oh, okay, yeah. - Thanks. - No problem. He had a name, you know. Thomas. After my grandfather. [all laughing] - Yes! - Yeah! - That's a new game we've created. - That was good. Throw me one. - Hey, wait... - That's 0 for 200. Oh! [laughing] [Scout] Are you sure you can do it? You toss me something. Toss me something. [Charlie] What's going on? What the hell's going on here? Who are you? Uh, Henry. I'm Maddie's... friend. [Charlie] Oh, okay. You're supposed to be grounded. Your dad is gonna freak. Clean this up, please. You, [snaps] come with me. Can you try and have a little compassion for your dad? He's going through a lot right now. I mean, how would he not accuse you of being a thief? You've been arrested now twice this year. Would you not ground your daughter? Yeah. Yeah. Look, Maddie, I know that you think you are owed an apology. But maybe you can... try and have a little empathy for him... just once. Look, I'll make you a deal. You apologize to your dad... and I'll help you clean up this whole mess. Do we have a deal? - Do we have a deal? - Yeah. Deal. All right. Hey, guys, I know you're listening. Come in here. Come in. - You, hormones. - Yeah. Get all the towels, put them in the laundry room. - You. - Gwen. Gwen, go outside, deal with all the outdoor stuff. - I don't want to have to deal... - Oh, no, ma'am, I do not do manual labor. Okay, I'll call the cops, tell them you're trespassing. Okay, well, that went south pretty fast. - I'll just go with her. - No, you come with me. Wait a second, where's Taylor? Um... last time I saw her, she was crying in the bathroom. Great. Clean this up, please. We don't have a lot of time. [sighing] Hey, buddy, what's going on? You want to talk about it? Pretty sure whatever social life I had is officially over. I pretty much felt that way all through school. You didn't have iPhones when you were in school. True. So this has something to do with... FaceTime? Facebook. Snaprat? Very funny. No. - Instaweb? - Please don't try another one. I'll show you, but you have to promise me you're not gonna laugh. I promise. [Taylor sniffling] [cartoonish falling sounds] [voice breaking] I'd run away, but that's Scout's thing. I fainted in front of everyone. That's not normal. You were under so much pressure, and you had low blood sugar. It could have happened to anyone. Sweetie, you have to stop being so hard on yourself. Come here. Come here, come here, come here. Sit, sit, sit. Can you just remind me again? Remind me who won the spelling bee. I did. And who won it while fainting? I guess I did. I rest my case. I have never been more proud of anyone in my entire life. You won... while fainting. That is crazy. I'm a fainting winner. You're a winner. I have an idea. Tomorrow, we take the day off, you and me. Mental health day. What do you think? Yeah. Come here. - Mm. I love you. Love you. - I love you too. - Hey. - Hey. You got a sec? There's, um... something I needed to talk to you about. Yeah, sure. Okay. Maddie... said something really weird. She, uh... About... Sarah. Okay. Well, she... said Sarah cheated on me. - What? - Yeah. [scoffs] Absolutely not. That is not possible. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, but... boy, when she said it, she was so certain. She was so... emphatic. John, Sarah was not cheating on you. I would know. I just don't know why she would say something like that. 'Cause she's a teenage girl, you know? She's pissed off, she's... She's dealing with her mother's death, she's being accused of shoplifting. She's lashing out, she's trying to hurt you. She's doing a pretty damn good job of it. Yeah. Are you sure? I'm 100 percent sure. Okay. You all right? - Yeah, I'm good. - Okay. [exhales] [John] Ah. Hey. Hey. What's... going on? I feel like I'm a bad person. I know I say things that make you feel that way, and I... I hate that, Maddie. Sorry I don't get it right all the time, but... I want you to know that I'm trying. I know. I know you are. I made plenty of mistakes when I was a teenager, that's... that's for sure. I just hate the fact that I... I know you know that I love you... but sometimes I make you feel like I don't... necessarily like you. I just want to stop doing that. I'm sorry, Dad. I've done and said some things that I really wish I could take back. I appreciate that. I just wish we could hit the restart button, you know? I want you to know that I... I love and adore you, you know? I... I'm totally here for you... and I need you. I need you too, Dad. Did you do the laundry? Yeah. I told you, I'm trying. Thank you. [John laughing] [laughter, whooping] [Maddie] Pillow fight! [Maddie yelling] [John] Ha-ha! Pillow fight! Ah! Want some company? [Maddie] When we hurt each other, it's hard to forgive even the little things. If you can't learn to let go in these moments... you'll never learn that the grudge means less than the love that's right in front of you.
