 Dude, your parents are gone, and we have the run of the house. Well, except for your sister and Sarah, your babysitter. Do you have any idea what this means? - Does it rhyme with... "Gideovames"? - Almost. - Knights of Ninjitsu IV! - Wick! I had to wait five hours in line for this puppy, and I had to pee - the entire time! - Well, this is going to be worth every bit of kidney damage. Wait, why do we need the run of the house for this? You know, so we can... yell and stuff.

 You yell in here all the time. - My mom is constantly telling- - Do you want to play or not? Debbie's my favourite, and now she's ruined. I'm sure I could fix her with some tape or something. Then can we have a dance party? Uh, sure. What else am I gonna do till your parents get home? Be right back. Nooo! It's not fair! I can't believe we burned out the processor now. Wait... I think if I can jump these cables we can get it working. Or, we could just use a minor reparation spell. It can fix anything! It says so right here.

 Really... Hah! Booyah! We're back in business. Come on. Sword chopping business. Don't worry, Debbie. I'll fix you. Glondo frum... frumundo vela. Hey, Jane. - Hey, look what I made. - Hi! I'm Debbie Dazzle. Wanna play? Ethan! You're gonna want to see this! ♪ She's the girl next door. ♪ ♪ Nice but not in a heart ♪ ♪ that's pure. ♪ ♪ She's the girl next door. ♪ ♪ Just for me. ♪ ♪ What you get is ♪ ♪ what you see. ♪ ♪ No more ♪ ♪ "Maybe it's Maybelline" ♪ â™ª She can give you everything â™ª â™ª you need. â™ª â™ª She's the girl next door. â™ª ♪ Nice but not in a heart ♪ ♪ that's pure. ♪ ♪ She's the girl next door. ♪ ♪ Just for me. ♪ What the heck is that? That is a life-sized Debby Dazzle. I think I had a dream about this once. Jane, can I talk to you for a minute? Jane, how did this happen? She had a broken leg so I used Benny's fix-it spell, - and now, well, she's alive! - Heh... Let's have ice cream and go to a roller disco dance party. - Yay! - I'm in! No parties. We need to turn her back into a doll. No, I don't want to go back. It's so boring. I want to have fun. I won't go back. I won't! Don't worry, Debbie. I won't let them changed you back. I promise. Oh, goodie! Let's celebrate. Cupcake dance party! Find a way to undo this. Now! Ugh! It's not that simple. I think Jane used a different spell. Or different words... I can't reverse it until I know the exact spell. Kitchen party! Just... find the spell. Fast. Oh, so you get to go to the party. That's fair! Whoa, this IS a cupcake party! - Did you find anything? - I've got good news and bad news. I couldn't figure out the spell. Good news: I'm on Level Two of Knights of Ninjitsu IV! - You've been up there for an hour! - It's a hard game. Mmm! Lemon swirl. No, please. No more cupcakes. Ooh, I'll take a lemon swirl. Oh, no. Look at your clothes. I know just what we should play next. - Debbie Dazzle fashion show! - Okay! Ouch! Are... are you okay? Ah! I'm fine. Great, in fact. Let's go have some fashion fun. - Whoa... - Whoa. What happened? I had a vision. Debbie needs life energy to stay in human form. She absorbs it through contact. - If... if we... - Whoa, easy, buddy. She must have drained you a little. Wait, maybe if we keep her away from people, she'll turn back into a doll. Let's hope. - Yeah! The fun starts now! - Rory, now's not the best time. Wait, you're not gonna invite me in? Sorry, the fun can start later. Aw, come on! Is this what girls usually do with their dolls? You don't do this with yours? Those are action figures. We have to get her alone. Hey, Debbie. Guess what? I just found a bunch of... ...uh, things that girls say go with shoes. Ooh, I love accessorizing. - Bedtime. - Aw. Right in here. Go crazy. But, I don't see any-. Ah! Hey, let me out! I want to play! You two are real party poopers! What about the window? We've on the second floor. It's not like she can fly. Hey, Ethan? My cousin who works at the Value Mart says he saw Benny pick up. Knights of Ninjitsu IV! Wow. You're much hotter than Ethan. You're funny. - What's wrong? - I'm so bored. - I'll keep you company. - Okay. Come in. I'm Debbie Dazzle. What's your name? - Rory. Or "The Rorster", "R Money", "R Dog", "Rorinator", "Rormaster"... or "Batman"! So, why are you here all alone? Oh, R Money, nobody wants to play with me. I know the feeling. How about we get out of here and have some fun? - Jane's out like a light. - Great. Now we just have to convince her she dreamed the whole thing. Hello, we're home! Hello? My parents! Can you go stall them? Now? Okay. Benny, quick! - Hey, Sarah. How'd it go? - Great. We... made cupcakes. - Oh. - Oh, uh... I promised Jane that you guys would both go up and give her a kiss as soon as you got home. - Okay. - Sure. - Here you go. - Thanks. - Thanks. - Uh... Have a good night. Um... yeah, have a good night. I guess. I know where to get the best gum in town! Let's go! Oh. Hello. Are you a... friend of Ethan's? I just realized you probably can't fly so... you want a lift? You think her batteries have run out by now? Probably, but we should still-. Is it... too much to hope that... she ran out of juice climbing out the window, and maybe fell into the compost? Ethan, what's wrong? Mom? Dad? I'd say she's now running on a full charge. Any luck? No, but I can't leave Jane alone, so I've only searched a three-block range of her old baby monitor. I didn't find Debbie either, and I covered a lot of ground- gotta love super speed. Thanks for trying. I gotta go. Okay, here's your lunch. Where's Mom? Sleeping in. Mom always puts a smiley face on the bag. Does Mom pack you candy and soda? I can live without a smiley face. I thought you'd see it my way. Did Debbie Dazzle really go to a party at Disco Beach? - I bet Dazzle Dan's there too. - Sure. I bet. Heh, you know Dazzle Dan! - Debbie's coming back, right? - Let's go. I hope that's your good news face. I'm 99.9% sure that I've found the right spell. Okay, let's do it. But I can't be sure how Jane pronounced it. She has to cast the reversal spell herself. - Wonderful. And my parents? - They should revert back to normal once the spell's been reversed. Good. Then all we have to do is find a life-sized killer fashion doll and... bring her down. No problem. - Have you talked to Rory? - Yeah. He sent me a text saying he was busy hanging out with his new girlfriend. Ohh, he's mad that we didn't let him in. Or... he actually has a girlfriend. What's wrong? Never seen a girl with a hot guy before? Ah! Do you know anyone who can fix a broken toy? Usually I just send stuff back to the manufacturer. - You know, the person that made it? - Yes, of course. The maker. You know lots of stuff. I like you. You smell like a Rubik's Cube. Shouldn't you two be in class? What's that? It sounds fun. Student IDs, please. You, get to class. Now. Now, young lady, let's get you straightened out- Ow! Are you all right? I will be. Hey, Rory, we know you're mad about last night, but- - Mad? How could I be mad? Last night was awesome! It's not every day you get to rescue a fair maiden from your clutches. Especially one who's so into me. Wait, what? You let Debbie out? Why would you do that? - Because she's hot. - Dude, she's a doll. I mean literally a doll. As in she's made of plastic! Yeah, all the hottest girls are. Rory, get this through your thick vampire skull: - She's not human! - Are you boys talking about me? There's my girl! How'd it go with Principal Hicks? Oh, him. He was such a doll. Hi, guys. Did you miss me? - Jumpy much? - Flesh, blood, more than eight points of articulation- all things I intend to keep, thank you. - You're coming with us, Debbie. - Over my undead body! Dude, listen. She's dangerous. So am I, so... back off! Huh! Sarah. So it's settled. You'll kick Debbie's sorry, plastic butt. - What? No, I never said that. - Ugh! Come on! She's got Rory wrapped around her little finger. I can't believe he got a girlfriend before me. Well, we have to find a way to split them up, or... ...someone. Nice. Okay, Kirk and Spock, you wanna fill me in on this little mind meld? - Well, if it isn't Super Nanny. - I'm sorry about last night, and I promise we'll go dancing soon, but... ...first I need a teensy favour. Teensy favour my butt... Well, hello, handsome. Who? You, silly! So, I was thinking, since we share the same taste in food, I might let you take me to dinner. - Nah, I don't think so. - Great! So just ditch the third wheel here, and... Wait, what? You had your chance with this, babe. The Rorster's found his soul mate. I just have to go powder my nose. Looking for me? Ow! I think you bent my fangs! You wanna play? Fine. Let's play! Rory. I need your help. Ah! That's... Wow, that's, just-. The one who made me. She can fix me. You must take me to her. Listen, we had a good run, but I think we should see other faces-people! I meant people. Later! Oh... Fine, I'll find her myself. Still no call from Erica? I guess she bailed on us. - Great. - No way. Erica may be self-absorbed, but she always comes through for me. Rory, where's Debbie? Beats me. She went off looking for "the one who made her". You guys were right. That girl is whack. - "The one who made her"? Who- - Jane! She's looking for Jane! I'm supposed to pick her up after school. Give me the keys. I'll pick her up and meet you there. - All right. Thanks for picking me up, Sarah. You run really fast! Okay, we're going to hide from Debbie. It'll be really fun. So go to your favourite hiding spot, and be really quiet. - Okay, go! - All right. One, two, three, four, five, six... I love hide and seek. Can I play? Stay away from Jane! She made me; She can fix me. But that doesn't mean we can't have some fun first. Jane! I want to play with you! That wasn't very nice... Whoa! You pretzeled her good! Sarah, are you okay? I'm okay. Ethan, what are you doing?! Scare Finder Rule Number 10: Nothing can do anything without a head. Heh! - Sarah, where's Jane? - She's in her hiding spot. You guys go, and I'll hold her off as long as I can. I'm gonna go find out how she read that spell. What are you going to do? I'm gonna buy us some time. Come on. Okay... You look a little bent out of shape. But I'll get fixed. I can't say the same for you. Jane, I know you're in there. You always hide in there. And I know how your mind works. We need to know how you said this fix-it spell. What's your price? I have some ideas. Jane! Where are you? ♪ Every time that you look my way... ♪ Oh, Debbie! ♪ ...but you never fail to resuscitate me... ♪ Dazzle Dan, what are you doing here? Become a doll with me again, Debbie. No. I don't want to go back. I'm alive now. Debbie, this world is boring. Do you want to have to work at a job? No. Not really. Then let's be dolls again. And you can come with me and we'll dance party on my... speedboat. Dazzle Dan doesn't have a speedboat. He has a hover yacht. Hover yacht? Really? Cool! You are a fake. Hi, Jane. Onomonabeana! Are you okay, Ethan? Yeah. Thanks, Jane. What happened to me? - What happened to you? - Nice hair, man. - Why are we in our clothes? - Why are we in Ethan's bed? So your parents don't remember anything? Nope. As far as they know, they came home and crashed for the whole day. We're off the hook. Less talking; More dancing! - Come on, guys. We promised. - Party at the Disco Beach! ♪ Keep feeling fine ♪ ♪ oh oh. ♪ ♪ Keep feeling fine ♪ ♪ until the sun goes down. ♪ There you go, Debbie. Good as new. Come on, Erica! You said You wanted to go dancing. Yeah, don't be such a party pooper. Or... poop. Poop away. She scares me! ♪ Until the sun goes. ♪ ♪ Keep feeling fine ♪ ♪ oh oh ♪
