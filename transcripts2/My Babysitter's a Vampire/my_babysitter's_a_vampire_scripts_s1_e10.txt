 So you uhm... You get sent here often? How could I let you convince me to rewire the PA system? Because I'm incredibly charming. Seriously? Dude, the Hulk would turn pink before she talked to you. Pink with envy. I'm never rewiring anything for you again. OK, what good is a ghost alarm in school if it isn't insanely loud? How was I supposed to know it was gonna blow out the principal's window? Young lady? You might want to go in. Trust me,

 you do not want to tick him off. Yeah, especially when we have to go in there after you. Don't do that. Ah! That is some nasty earwax! - We are running out of daylight. - Ha! Ha! Ha! You, uh, better go in there. Pff! That girl was a total "butter ears". - What? - I liked everything "but her ears". Wow! How are you still dateless? I don't know. * She's the girl next door. * * Nice but not in a heart * * that's pure. *

 * She's the girl next door. * * Just for me. * * What you get is * * what you see. * * No more * * "Maybe it's Maybelline" * * She can give you everything * * you need. * * She's the girl next door. * * Nice but not in a heart * * that's pure. * * She's the girl next door. * * Just for me. * Oh, man, that earwax was epic! I'm serious. I couldn't get the earbud out. It was like it yanked it back in. Earwax can't do that, Benny. Hence my unease, but that explains why my charm fell on deaf ears. Maybe she just ignored you. Like all the other girls do? If they're running from you, they're not ignoring you. Hey, guys! Getting punished for your ghost alarm thing, huh? Sarah, can I ask you a question? Do girls have like way more earwax than guys? Is it a puberty thing? Do guys have fewer brain cells or is it just a Benny thing? Well, I mean... it takes a lot more than that... She didn't even wait for my answer. Is it just me or are there a lot more weeds here than usual? Maybe they only get pulled when someone gets punished. Oh, gardening isn't a punishment, gentlemen. It is an opportunity. An opportunity to get hands dirty and jabbed with thorns? No, an opportunity to look within. To banish the weeds inside your soul. - Ahh. - Ahh? What you have to do is remove the root, so that the weeds never grow again. I really think a spray bottle of Weedageddon'd be easier. Thanks for telling us this, Principal Hicks, but... why are you telling us this? Normal troublemakers clog toilet bowls. You two rewire PAs, break my office windows, talk about space demons. - I worry about you. - So you want us to clog more toilets? No, forget it. Carry on weeding. Man, that inner weed stuff was pretty emo. Man, that sick music concert ran really late last night. Wow! I see you've noticed my limited edition t-shirt. Who's Single Tare? It's Single TEAR. You listen to Single Tear? I didn't think you liked anything cool. Have you heard the new remix of Love Shaped Heart? Ah! Hearing it is one thing, spice angel, but seeing it is a more awesome thing. I'm downloading their double acoustic Antarctica concert video as we speak! Really? I've tried to download that like a 100 times, but all I keep getting are videos of the stupid has-been singer. ♪ I'm about to choose you ♪ ♪ I'm about to buzz you ♪ ♪ baby. ♪ ♪ Heyyyy- ♪ Looks like you've been "roll'd". I hate that! - I know! - I found one torrent that's the real deal. Ultra hi-def, 10-channel surround. It's 246 gigs of Single Tear angst and frustration. - What's wrong? - What's wrong... ...is that I have something in common with you. Two things, my fellow bloodsucker. We're practically soulmates. I'm going home to change my shirt. I wonder if my allergies will kill me before the sunstroke does. My money is on the sun. You burn like a marshmallow. There she is. I'm gonna try and talk to her again. See if she can ignore my funniest story. Oh! Come on! Hey, Sarah. You know, the buttons are on the front, right? Very funny. I think I have a virus. Can you, you know, geek this thing for me? Sure! Ha! Ha! No... Oww! - ...problem. - Thanks, Ethan. If you do this for me, I'll be grateful 'till the day you die. I'd say I'd die, but I have this whole immortal thing going on. Later! And that is why I'm no longer welcome at the bowling alley. You know, I think you're really interesting. Do you want to talk about yourself for a bit? What kind of girl can resist both my bowling anecdote and talking about herself? Strange! Speaking of strange... Hey, Rory, what's up? Erica and I totally like the same band. Single Tear? Aren't all those songs about how hard it is to be them? Yeah, they totally speak to me. They're rich and famous. I'm a vampire. Nobody gets us. Nobody's ever got you. I don't think liking the same band is gonna make much of a difference. Ah, maybe not right away, ♪ There's no time ♪ ♪ like the future. ♪ Ah! Ugh! - You know what's going on here? - Yeah, the music industry is finally fighting back at illegal downloads. No, but this is messed up. Yeah, messed up with 4 gigs of clutch tunes. - Can I have it back? - Not a chance. But you can tell us the last place you plugged it in. My parents won't let me download at home. They think the internet is a bad influence. You're already a soulless undead creature of the night. How much worse can you get? Dude, if my mom knew I was a vampire I'd be grounded for like a month. I've got 80% of my future love life downloaded, boys. By tomorrow, I predict Erica and I will interface. Hey! Did that cord just move? What the heck is that? Our homework. Oh man! OK, fine. I really want to see that video. Uh... I don't have it yet. But I can totally air guitar it for you! Waaaaaa- Stop immediately forever! When will this download be finished? Uh, tonight. I'm downloading in the school's computer lab, and I can totally burn you a DVD. Fine, I will meet you here tonight to pick it up. Like... a date? I just don't wanna anyone to see us together. Ah! An intimate date! I'm gonna need candles. Whoa, this is weird. Chlorophyll polymer ectoplasm? It's like a combination of paranormal weed and Ethernet cable. There's plant matter in the cables? No, they're combined. Half alive, half plastic. Like Heidi Montag. Ooh! Nice burn. Nobody's reported anything like this online. - I wonder. - Me too. Mostly about what it would be like to have eyes on my feet. Then I'd always see where I'm going. And you'd get a black eye every time you kicked something. Nah, just wear special see-through shoes. Oh, weird. Sarah's laptop is virus-free. Maybe it's a hardware problem. Smells mouldy. Like my grandma's sock drawer. Let's open this thing up. Ugh! Circuit salad! Ugh! Here, probably the same as Rory's Zypod and the cables in the computer lab. Computers, cables, Zypods... I think I have a theory. Really? My theory is that you should be able to figure this out. I was thinking there's actually something strange growing in the school's computer network. That's it! I knew I was onto something. We gotta get back to the school and stop this thing. I got another theory. It's gonna be scary. My theory was right. Do you remember this hallway being so... ominous and terrifying this afternoon? It's not so bad. It's just a deserted hallway with... ...creepy flashing lights and an overriding sense of doom. Yeah, it's terrifying! Let's just get in there and get this over with. Yeah. Oh, I think we're too late. Man! This stuff spreads fast. This girl is garnished. What do we do? I think we need some kind of weed killer. I am not going to pull any weeds out of this girl's face. You go to the chemistry lab and I'll call Sarah. - Hello? - Hey, Sarah, it's me. Hey! How's my laptop? Please, please tell me you brought it back to life. Um, not exactly. Are you busy tonight? Not anymore. Erica met a guy while we were waiting in line for a movie, and then she ditched me! Great! I mean, um, we could use a hand with something. It's kind of related to your laptop. Wait, you're asking me for computer help? I thought you were the "nerds on demand". Well, this isn't exactly a programming issue. Do you like gardening? The last time I bought a plant, I killed it in a week. Perfect! The more plants you've killed, the better. You guys really need to stop inhaling the science experiments. - Be there in a bit. - OK! - Let's wax some weeds! - OK. W-w-wait! We don't want to burn her face. Spray her roots! I mean, legs. - Can I use my line again? - If you insist. Let's wax some weeds! - Stop, stop, stop! - I'm stopping. - What did you see? - I saw a tree. It was... angry. How could you tell? Was it choking squirrels? Aw, man! I was really hoping you guys would have this fixed by now. This didn't screw up my download, did it? Maybe we should look up your angry tree online? Uh, not here. Something tells me that it's not a good idea to touch these computers! Looks like the school's wireless is down. I'm not getting a signal. We'll do it from my place. What about her? Uh, I don't think we should move her until we know what's going on. The weed killer didn't go over so well. - OK. Should we call a doctor? Gardener? Cable guy? Couldn't you guys just water her and make sure she gets enough sun? OK, we'll come back for her. Let's go! - Rory, I said don't touch it! - Don't worry about me. I'm big, bad, bloodsucking vampire. I can look out for myself. - Listen... - Ooh! Vanilla Sunrise! Hey, Benny, check this out. The oldest tree in town just got cut down a few weeks ago. It's right next to the school. Yeah, looks like the tree was a site of old druid rituals. So this tree soaks up magic over the years, gets knocked down, and what, now wants revenge? Well, somebody cuts me off at the shins, they're gonna hear about it. So what does this mean for what's happening at school? Well, like Principal Hicks said: To kill the weeds, we gotta cut out the root. Time to do some gardening. - Let's wax some weeds! - Really? Again? It's all I got. Oh-oh! What's with the human salad bar? Sorry, there's this weird root thing. - Ethan and Benny are fixing it- - Never mind. I just... I wanna get out of here. This is creeping me out. You look... really pretty. Thanks, I'm on a date. - With me? - No. With a guy that could actually get a date with me. So, where's the DVD? Almost ready. Sit down. We can swap secrets while we wait. Pass. I told my date I was in the bathroom. I'll be back after he buys me dessert. Ah, looking forward to it. There, it is. Or was. That is one freaky stump. - Do you think a tree could hold a grudge? - For what? I carved my name into it. "Benny loves Sally." And Beth, Kailey, Della, Erica- - Benny! - Catwoman. OK, what do we do? Well, looks like the only way to stop it is to cut the root. Roots lead back to the school. This tree wasn't ready to die. Looks like we found the mother root. You think? The school's internet cables run through here. These crazy roots have grown right into them. - Does this mean more yard work? - Let's get this thing open. Looks like someone is holding it shut. - Something strong. - Maybe there's some haunted Venus flytrap who's trying to get illegal pay-per-view? Right, right? Cutting the roots should kill it. Then we can save vegetable girl. Yeah! It's gardening time! - Is that the best you can do? - Pretty much. - Ah! - Ugh! Eww! Well, uh, she seems better. Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! I just downloaded myself a love life! What's going on? This isn't a Single Tear video I've ever seen before. Goodbye, evil screensaver. Nobody can save you from "Lord of the Power Button!" Booyah! Ah! Ah-ah! What kind of cheap boy wants to share a slice of cake? Erica, Erica, run! Save yourself! - OK. - No, wait. Come back! Oh... Did anybody else just lose their job well done feeling? Hey, where's Benny? - Where did you get that? - Janitor's closet. Always upgrade before a boss level. - Let's go. - OK. I will not be destroyed by poison or blade! I will build a new force fertilized by human souls. We're dealing with one angry tree now. And it's upgraded its hardware. - With Rory. - Ew! This thing's mostly cable and computer now. We can't just spray it with weed killer. No, but smashing works on almost everything. - I'm with her. - Wait! If it's half tree, half computer, maybe a virus can infect its system and take this thing down. Where do you just get a computer virus? You've hacked into a computer system before, right? - Just cover me! - Cover you with what!? Just keep killing and don't let me get killed, OK? Simple enough?! Come on, come on, come on. OK, this is what I call computer hacking! You're parasites! I'm gonna "pwn" you, newb! I got you! Hey, tree boy! Ha! Ha! Get ready to be "nick rolled"! Nooooo! NO! ♪ Choose you love you ♪ ♪ choose you love you. ♪ Rory! Are you ok? Guys, I had the weirdest dream. I was made out of carrot and I got "nick rolled". Ha! Ha! I can't believe Hicks blamed us for this mess. Maybe we should start clogging more toilets. It would be easier. Thanks for fixing my laptop, Ethan. No problem. Do you have my Single Tear DVD? Right here. Not so fast. When I was almost plant food, you took off to save yourself. You and I? So done. Whatever. Just give it to me. No! Please? Well, OK, I can't stay mad at you. - Now, can we go out? - Not a chance. Nice try. Well, you almost stood up to her this time. Baby steps, boys. Baby steps. * She's the girl next door. * * Nice but not in a heart. * * that's pure.. * * She's the girl next door.. * * Just for me.. *
