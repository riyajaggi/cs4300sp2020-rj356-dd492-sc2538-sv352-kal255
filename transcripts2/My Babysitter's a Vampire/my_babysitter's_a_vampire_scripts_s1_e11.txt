 Oh, man, why can't we be at home watching So You Think You Can Fly? Eating a triple meat lover's pizza with extra meat. Yeah. Instead, our teachers could bash in here any second... and scoop out our brains like chip dip. Ooh. You think we can outrun them? I don't have to outrun them. I just have to outrun you. You know, I think they'd go for your brain first there, Honor Roll. Where is Sarah? We could really use her help right now. I don't think she was in a very helping mood today. I'm not breaking any arms or smashing anyone just because he called you...

 - What was it? - Teethan. Benny Rabbit. It's not what he says, it's haw he says it. Ahem. Let's go, bays. Right with you, sir. If we're not there in five minutes, start baring kids without us. We'll be right there, sir. Forget it. Lack, I have a field trip to the art gallery. Lucky me. Later Teethan, Benny Rabbit. Sounds cute when she says it. Oh! We're so dead. This is not fair.

 Just a hint would have been nice. Bromine... aluminum... mnitragen. Brain. Brain. They hate this stuff. If it lasts long enough, we should be able to hold them off until Sarah gets back. Sarah is coming back, right? We're the mast important things in her life, right? The use of light and shade is like an emotional fireworks display. And the... And the asymmetric tension. Sometimes I think he's never gonna stop talking. I know. With Mr. Callingwaad, it's like a picture's worth a thousand wards. And he's determined to tell us every single one of them. Exactly. At least there's still so much to lack at. - Ethan, I'm in class. - Yeah, me tan. The teacher's kind of giving us some free time. Brain. I feel hat. I need a... Excuse me. I think what he meant... is text freely amongst yourselves. Hello? Planet Ethan? Oh. Sorry. I just wanted to fallow up. If you did change your mind... about scaring this jerk, his name's Scott, he's tall and... Ethan, I said no. You're gonna have to learn to fight your own battles sometimes, okay? - I have to go. - Yeah, you're right. Okay. Listen, have you ever seen a teacher just walk right out of class, mumbling? Teachers are strange. Right new my art teacher is stroking a painting. This turgid shade of brawn. Brawn. Brain. - Yeah. I guess so. - Brain. Thanks. Bye. Sc can I see what you've been drawing? It's nothing. Just some sketches... - Came an. - Na. Na. That's a wicked grip. Hey, these are really good. Wow! - Can I have this? - I wish you'd let me keep it. After all, you get to see this every time you lack in the mirror. That's not as often as you might think. You're not like other girls, are you? You could say that. Brain. Principal Hicks. Trying to guess my locker combo? Here, let me help you. Yeah, maybe you should sleep an it. This is one student-teacher conference I'm gonna have to skip. Came an. This thing isn't gonna last much longer. Maybe we should call Rory? Rory? Is it that bad? Well, he did say he wanted to protect the innocent. There goes the French teacher, Mrs. Lafleur. She's not lacking tan good either. Yeah, well she's also a teacher, so who "wa-heck" cares? Greetings, mortals. You lack stranger than usual. Very perceptive, mortal. Of course, you are among the few who know my real secret identity. RV. Rory Vampire. - Defender of the Innocent! - Brain. Hark, a cry for help. Someone is in need of brains. RV, away. You mean, someone else is in need of brains? You know, maybe he's finally gonna meet his soul mate after all. Brain. Whoa. A dilemma. The teacher's lounge is off limits to students. Who knows what goes an in there? Brain! Excuse me, lad. May I play through? I wouldn't go in there, sir. I heard many strange noises, like: Uuh! And "Eee!" And even one "Oeeg!" Oh, yes. The staff is a tad excited. I had Lotta Latte coffee delivered to celebrate 100 Days Till Summer Vacation. Think of it. Summer. Gulf. I can do it. Yes, yes, I can do it. Ha, ha! Sir, once you go in there, I can't save you. You know the legend. When a student ventures into the teacher's lounge, he never comes out. - Never. - Ha, ha, ha. Yes, I know the legend. And who do you think made it up, eh? Huh? Ah... Oh, hello, Mr. Taffey. Haw are you? - I say... - Na, I mustn't. What happens in the teacher's lounge stays in the teacher's lounge. Besides, haw bad could it possibly be? Zombies! Zombies! Zombies! - We need to warn everybody. - What? Didn't you hear me screaming? - I think we've done our part. - Came an! - Here, wait for my cue. - What? What? Um... Ah! You're an. Testing. Check, one, two. - Testing, count them. - Benny! Attention, all Whitechapel students. This is an emergency life-saving announcement from Benny Weir. Admit it, girls, you know who I am. Due... Due to unforeseen circumstances, ah, beyond cur central... we have no choice but to cancel all classes, extracurricular activities, and... Zombies! Run! Ah! Ethan! Snap out of it! Came an! Let's go. Benny, I just had a vision. The coffee from Lotta Latte. That's what's making this happen. Lotta Latte? Figures. You'd have to be brain-dead to pay 5 bucks a cup for flavored bean juice. - But that doesn't make any sense. - Came an! This coffee's been around for a long time. Why is it all of a sudden turning people into zombies? What changed? Whoa. This isn't our Liquid Chicken Debrainer. - What? - It says "Lotta Latte." It's the same calarjug, but bigger. With a lat more warning labels. Sc where is it? Uh... - Can't I just peek? - Na. If I'm keeping this one, I want it to be almost as good as the original. Heh. Well, you're making the original blush. Stay still. Admit it, this beats listening to Callingwaad drone an and an. Sc when I saw this place across the street, I knew it'd be perfect for this. Oh. My gash. I'm sorry, I, I have to go. Lack, I just wanted a date, not a full-an action movie. - Listen, I think you need to call someone... - I'm sorry, there's no beverages. Our machine is all whacked up. Something totally gaaped up the filters, see? Something is wrong here. Yeah, like I said, the filters are so gunked up. Me, I'm more of like a Chai Say type of person... but our customers today went crazy for the batch. Everyone's all like, "Gah, gah! Brains. Brains. Woof!" Ha, ha. You know? Oh, here's some of our customers now. - You might wanna run, or hide. - Oh, no, that's okay. As long as I make them the lattes, then they won't touch me. Of course new the machine's broken. Oh, crud. We're gonna die. Oh! Ew! Chicken breath. All right, we're safe in here. Trust me, teachers will never enter a student washroom. - It's like an unwritten rule in education. - Sure. Right up there with "Don't eat students' brains." You know who's fault this really is? Sarah's. "Why don't you fight your own battles?" Oh, strung. Did I miss anything? - We were just talking about you. - Yeah. - Hooray! We're saved. - We were worried about you. I had a vision about what's turning people into zombies. - It's coffee. - I know. Lotta Latte. I had a chat with the folks dawn there earlier. Wow, you are, like, really good at that. I tried to call you to warn you. You never picked up. Yeah, sorry about that. I kind of lent my phone to Mr. Collingwood. Oh. But... All right, can we go new? I mean, after I wash my hands, of course. There's nowhere to go. The streets are crawling with zombies. And the longer we wait, the worse this thing gets. Don't you have some, like, geek know-haw an zombie fighting? Well, in every zombie movie, it's always Smash them in the head. Except in SuperDead 4. They cured the zombies with Anti-Zambulax. You're right. If we get a sample of the coffee, maybe we can analyze it and find a cure... or a weakness. Sounds like we're headed to the lab. Let's go. Wait. I think we're gonna need my ectaplasmic refractar from home. - Lave that ectaplasmic refractar. - Here's the deal. You get a sample, and I'll race to your house to get your ecto thing. And we meet in the lab in 10 minutes. Deal? Um... The refractar is in my roam, an my microscope, okay? Okay, she's leading them away. Goad. There should be coffee in the teacher's lounge. - But first we gotta make a pit stop. - Pit stop? - We're already here. - Nat that kind of pit stop. Who would have thought the bib lab had such big pig brains? Oh. I guess I did. Okay, aver there. Fallow me. Oh! Okay, so we throw the pig brain, grab the coffee... and then we're home free. I don't think you understand the meaning of "home free." Dude, turn that thing off. Hello? I can't talk. What? Really? That's amazing. - Benny. - Five hundred minutes... unlimited text, 30 bucks. That's good, right? Hang HP- Okay, pig brain... I§ go. All right. All right, I'm going for it. Okay. Okay. Right here. Okay. Okay. - I dropped the sample. - I'll get the coffee. You go. Oh, so you wanna play rough, huh? This is for my D-minus in media studies. Benny? Is that you? Benny? - Benny. Are you okay? - Never better. Check this out. Coal. Is that hat chocolate? Gut you! Check out what I swiped from the teacher's lounge. Hicks tank this from me in September. Wait, you were in the teacher's lounge? Candy, games, TV, couches. Zombies? Really? I just thought they were all really grumpy. Whatever. We have to get this coffee to the lab. Chemistry? Baring. I'd rather smack me some zombies. RV Away. We better re-arm. Totally. Let's get this cure going, huh? Okay, ectaplasmic thingy check. Brains. Raw.! Mrs. Morgan, maybe you should try decaf. Sorry. I'm still babysitting Friday night, right? Oh, thanks. Did you see my mom'? We exchanged a few wards. Huh. You okay, Benny? You look really sweaty. Yeah, I'm fine. I'm pumped. Let's do this. Zombie cure. There's definitely something going an here. These cells are like neurons, like brain cells. - But they're mutating. - Okay. Mutant neurons. Coal. - Company. Speed up the geeking. - You can't rush science. You can if you don't want your brain eaten. What happened? The neurons are gone. It just lacks like plain old coffee now. It's like it cured itself just sitting there. Maybe it has to be fresh? Hat. That's why the zombies hate the fire extinguisher. - It's cold. - G reat. Sc we just wait here until January? Can't we just blast the air conditioning or something? Sounds like a plan. Benny, pack up. We gotta fight our way to the mechanical room. Who are you kidding? They'll break you like a fingernail. I'll do it. - Oh! If... If you wanna go. - Totally. - Next zombie rescue is an us. - Yeah. Brain. Benny, what's up? You lack really pale and sweaty. - Did you get bit back there? - Na. Gut bit up here. - Benny. Why didn't you tell me? - I thought you might... get cure, fix Benny. Can I bite your head? Came an. Can't there be something as simple as an an switch? Just stay with me. Nat right with me, but, you know, because of the biting thing. Just hang an, okay? Hang an. Benny. Benny. - G rrr! - Whoa! Brain. Mom'? Not you too. Rory, you scared me. Come here, make your geek self useful. Brain. Aaah! Do not bite me or you're gonna be the most undead vampire that ever un-died. It works? Huh. Guess you're cooler than you look. Zombies, just cold. Na more brains. We good? Yeah. The zombies are all cooled off and catching some 2's. I get tired just lacking at them. - You know what we need'? A coffee. - No, I'll pass, thanks. Law fat, latte machachina, no foam. And so, all aver Whitechapel, people are cranking the AC... trapping their loved ones in freezers and throwing ice cream at children. That's haw yesterday's bizarre outbreak of "Hat Coffee Fever"... was frozen in its tracks by common cold, thanks to local heroes like these. Hi. Lotta Latte coffee, it's all better now. I can't believe I liked that guy. This stinks. We saved the day. - We? You almost bit my face off. - I meant before that. I'm sorry, Benny. But we unsung heroes have to take the high road. Right, Sarah? It's impossible. What? Did you hear that? Great. The high road. Heh.
