 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES But... will you be back? I think so. In the summer, for sure. Hmm. It's weird to come back here in the summer. - Why is it weird? - The place you're going has a beach. I don't think I can come back in winter, though. Hmm, yeah, I doubt you'll come back. Especially the first year. - But maybe later on. - Won't you miss it here?

 I doubt it. - Dad said that Emilia-Romagna is nice. - Ale! - Come on! - Let's go! It's a four-hour drive, come on. Ale, wait. I have an idea. Let's say that, in a few years, when you'll have become a motorbike champion, you'll call me, and I'll come work for you there. So you'll be my manager? I don't know how to be a manager. No, I'll be your mechanic. I'll start learning right away, and I'll become the best mechanic ever. So I'll be ready when you call me.

 Ah, right. Mechanic... Because my father will want to be my manager for sure. Dario! Don't you have a home? Come on. Your mom will be worried. You brought flowers? No, come on... not the flowers. - I'll put them in front. - No, not the flowers! Come on... they'll wither. So? Are you in? It's a great idea. Ale... It's late. Anyhow, it would be great. - So... deal? - Deal. Dario, what do you want me to say? I think you're making a mistake. I don't know what I'm doing here anymore. Ale quit racing, so what can I do? It's all gone to shit. I don't know if I want to do this anymore. Dario... If you want to leave, do it. Go ahead. But at least think about it. A few days... or a few weeks... Take all the time you need. I've been here for 30 years. And every single day, I think, "That's it. I quit. Enough of this." Then when the morning comes, I pull up the shutter... and I find myself before these babies. My hands then move on their own, and time flies. Look, you're good at this. Sure, you're a bit of a slacker... ...but you're still good. See you around, Piero. Dario. You don't necessarily need Ale to work on a race bike. You can make it on your own. Ale? It's going to be all right. Are you up for it? Ready? - Huh? - Set... - Go! - Start! Will you tell me where we're going? Um... Somewhere. You've been saying that for an hour. It's a surprise. I'm not in the mood to play. I'm tired and worried. Take me back home. My mother is alone with Blue. She needs me. - And I want you to come with me. - Where? To Rome. - Rome? - Yes. - No, Ale. I can't go there. - Why? Blue is sick, she needs me. I need to go home. Want to call her to check if she's okay, so you can calm down? Ever since we started dating, I've wanted to go home, and I want to go with you. It's just for the day. We'll be home tonight. Think of it as a little trip. Come on, it'll be good for you. Do you trust me? ♪ How long will you try ♪ ♪ To hide all the terror inside ♪ ♪ How long will you be able ♪ ♪ To hide all the love inside ♪ Hi. - How is she? - She's fine. - Is she asleep? - She's awake. - Is she with... Summy? - No, Summy is not here. Edo! - Hi, sweetie. - Hi, Isa. I haven't seen you in ages. I feel bad about that. I do, too. - I brought croissants. - Thanks. You're both so sweet. Come in. Hi. Hi. - May I? - Sure. What's that? Nothing. Does it hurt? Not that much. I'm sorry. What are you saying, Blue? It was my fault. I shouldn't have let you leave. Ever been to the emergency room? No. What's it like? Well... they give you a color. White if it's nothing serious. Green, if it's so-so. Yellow, a bit worse. And red if it's serious, and you need treatment. - What color did they give you? - Red. Then they put me inside a tube to see if I'd hit my head. That reassured them, because only my arm and knee hurt. - And arms and knees aren't serious. - Right. Good. And you? I... just waited. And... I realized it was stupid of me. - Don't say that. - No. It's the truth. It doesn't make any sense to go to the ER because of love. I thought about it, actually. - It's okay if you don't love me. - Blue, it's complicated... - But I still love you, anyway. Okay? - Okay. When I get over it, I'll tell you. The doctor said it'll pass. - Is that all he said? - No. He said they'll take the bandages off in a week, and that they should change the code from red to blue. He said it sounded better. He's right. Blue is a beautiful name. I missed you. I missed you, too. - How did she seem? - Well... she seemed fine. It was her first time getting drunk. But Isa looked a bit tired, didn't she? Yeah, a little. - He's not coming back? - Summy's dad? I don't know. You don't see Summy that often, either. Right? A lot less. - Not too often. - Not at all. You? Me? Never. Sofi... Did Summy tell you anything? No... about what? Nothing... It's about me. Why, did something happen between you two? No. Tell me, Edo. - Nothing happened. - What happened? No, well... I don't know. Mmm. I met someone. Ah. That's good. - That was it? - Yeah. - What is she like? - Just a summer fling. Good. Why don't you see her anymore? I... I met someone, too. Really? A summer fling for me, too. Oh... okay. And I don't really feel like it. Ever since she started dating that guy... You don't like him, do you? Well... No, not really. Anyhow... - Bye, Sofi. - Bye, Edo. ♪ Your eyes are filled With these ocean waves ♪ ♪ Every time things go wrong We have to talk about it ♪ ♪ And I'd love to make up But we launch missiles instead ♪ ♪ How much do we have to suffer Before we get a bit of love ♪ ♪ Before we smile a little ♪ ♪ I hate it when you turn around And leave in a rush ♪ ♪ You grab your bag ♪ ♪ And don't call back ♪ ♪ Sorry, I don't think about it anymore ♪ ♪ You've broken down my love ♪ ♪ I won't fall for it again ♪ ♪ Wait, please, if you want We'll get back together ♪ ♪ Or just take the metro, running fast ♪ ROME-PERUGIA ♪ And I'll no longer talk to you ♪ ♪ You've broken down my voice ♪ ♪ And I'll no longer talk to you ♪ ♪ And I'll no longer talk to you ♪ DELETE Hi. Can we talk? - I was a bit mean to you. - That's an understatement. Dario, I'm sorry. Me, too. What can I do to be forgiven? Should I get on my knees? You know, that's not a bad idea. - It's not like I'd be ashamed to do it. - Really? - Please, forgive me. - What are you doing? - Come on, get up. - Say you'll forgive me. I won't get up unless you forgive me. Come on, I forgive you. Are you happy now? I didn't mean to say those things. I think I needed someone to say it. Dario, you should talk to Maddalena. Hmm. And tell her everything you feel. - Without overthinking it. - I already did. What? I already did! - What do you mean? How did it go? - Well, yeah, like shit. A kick in the guts. I'm sorry. Don't be. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have done it. You're to blame for the biggest failure of my life. Now, it's your turn. - For what? - Don't act like you don't know. Go tell her what you feel. - Tell whom? - Summer. Ever thought of telling her you love her? Every time I see her. From the very first time. So go and tell her. - It's pointless. - It's not. Hey, babe. Hi. I'll be done in half an hour. - If you'd like to wait... - Yeah, I'll wait there. Hi. Hi. I'm not with Madda. Can I sit? I'm here for Sissy. Her shift will be over soon. Sure. I was going to go... Where? I can come with you. - Where? - Wherever you want. - Weren't you waiting for Sissy? - I can come back later. Shall we go? Let's go. ♪ But you're crazy, Napoleon ♪ ♪ If you want to go to sleep ♪ ♪ When the night is calling your name ♪ - Shit. - What is it? My parents are on their way back. I was hoping to meet them. Is this her? Yeah. Why haven't you been back here? I don't know. I don't know. Maybe I thought it'd make me angry. But all the things I had here when I was a kid, from friends to toys... Even time itself. I sacrificed it all for those bikes. And now, I don't know if I did the right thing. My dad put me on a bike when I was a child and told me I had to follow the track, and that's what I did. - But you liked racing. - Of course I liked it. I loved it. Because it's something that gets in your blood. You win one race, then two, three... And you always want to win. - It's ridiculous. - And when you lose? When you lose... You're on your own. Because everyone always tells you that you must win. And you think it's the only way that you'll be loved. But ever since we got together, I don't believe that anymore. Don't you miss racing? Of course I miss it. Still... I like my current life more than my past. I was born here. I remember it being taller, actually. You were right to insist. I'm glad you decided to come back here with me. I didn't choose to. It was the only way. And besides, it's not the only reason we came. No? No. There's another place we must see. Where? Well... come with me. - Want one? - Thanks. I had an impossible love, too. I was in love with my math professor back in high school. Really? I went to a science school. I'd see her all the time. What a nightmare! I liked everything about her. Her hair, her eyebrows, her lips... The way she moved the chalk from one hand to the other. I didn't even listen to her. I'd just marvel at the sound of her voice. How did it go? - I flunked school. - Really? Yeah, but it was a blessing for me, because I met Tamara. Who's Tamara? My first possible love. Have you made up with Ale? Did you fight over Madda? Let's just forget it. - Did she tell you to talk to me? - No. Why? Maybe she wants to know how I'm doing, or she pities me. I don't know if she pities you. And honestly, I don't really care. - You really haven't noticed anything? - About what? Marty, just say it. I'm having a hard time, so don't start. I like you, Dario. Madda was ahead of me, so I quietly waited for my turn. Just to see what would happen. I even sent you signals. What signals? See? You didn't even pick up on them. Know what that means? - Just one thing. - What? That you don't like me. Wait... wait a moment. Wait... wait, stop. Stop there! Wait a moment. Just a moment. Okay. Sorry... I didn't get it. Okay? That's my point! No, you have to understand that I'm a total moron about this. - You're not. - When it comes to feelings, I am. Okay? But I decided to stop. - What does that mean? - That I'd never seen you. Up until a moment ago, when you talked to me, I had never seen you. - And now? - Now I see you. Tell me something in German, please. All right. Two fish meet. - One of them says, "Hi!" - Hi. The other says, "Where?" It's a joke, actually. So basically, two fish meet... and in German, "Hei" means both "Hi" and "shark." - That's why it's funny. - Keep going. I believe that today, I... - Edo, wait a minute. - What? I don't know if you're ready, but I'd like to take things a little further. What do you say? - Of course, Giulia. - Finally! - You've done it before, right? - A couple of times. - You? - A bit more than a couple. Want to put it on, or shall I? Okay, I'll do it. If I can, anyway. - This place is so amazing. - You like it? - Where are we? - You'll see. - Good evening. - Good evening. Let's see... Here you go. - This way, please. - Thank you. Is it a concert? You'll see. What kind of concert is it? Come on, let's go. - Good evening. Are they numbered? - Yes. Good... thank you. Why did you bring me to a concert? Uh... Because I wanted to show you someone. Are you insane? Is this why you brought me here? - You've ruined everything. - Hey... Summy. Don't touch me. Calm down... What's the big deal? - The big deal? - Yeah, nothing happened. If I wanted to see my father, I'd do it myself. Don't shout. - What's this bullshit? - It's not bullshit. - What were you thinking? - That I care about you. Okay? I know you want to talk to him, but you're afraid. - I don't. - You do. - No. And I'm not afraid. - You are. Do you want me to make up with him? I didn't say that. Just talk to him. - To say what? "Fuck you"? - Sure, if you want. - At least you'll have said it. - What would you know? I know you're pissed off with him because he neglected Blue. You think he's an asshole, because he's never home. But you feel guilty for thinking that. I thought this day would be about us. - I thought you brought me here to show... - Lower your voice. No! I won't lower my voice. You lied to me. If I hadn't done it this way, you would have never come. - You're an asshole. - All right, then. I'm an asshole. It was such a wonderful day until now. Hello? Hi, sweetie! How are you? Everything okay? - Hi, Mom. - How are you, darling? I'm okay, I guess. Where did you go? Are you coming back? No, we're actually still out. But how's Blue doing? - Blue's fine. - Ladies and gentlemen, the concert is about to begin. We ask you to take a seat and turn off your phones. - Okay, Mom. I've gotta go. - No, wait. Someone wants to say hi. We waited all day to surprise you, but since you wouldn't come... Wait. Hi, darling. Dad... what are you doing at home? I came back. I was worried about Blue. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Mom wanted to know whether you'll be back for dinner. Um... I don't think I'll make it. I'll be late. - So I'll see you tomorrow? - Okay. - Okay. See you tomorrow. - See you. Bye. So your father's white? My dad is not here. What do you mean? Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome. Before we start, I have an announcement to make. Sadly our trumpet player, Anthony Bennati, won't be here with us tonight. He had some family issues and had to go back home to tend to his daughters. So we would like to start this concert with a special song dedicated to Anthony.
