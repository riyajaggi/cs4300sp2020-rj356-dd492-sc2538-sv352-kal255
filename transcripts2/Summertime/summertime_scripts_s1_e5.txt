 And what does Mommy do? Mommy sings with me. And Blue? Blue doesn't do anything. - Daddy? - Yes? Why was Blue named after a color? She's named after Kind of Blue. It's an album by the best trumpet player in the world. But aren't you the best trumpet player in the world? No, Summer. I'm not the best in the world. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Okay. Listen, I'm going to get the car. You wait here, okay? I'll be right back.

How are you? I'm really sorry, but I couldn't come back. I bet you're really busy, but will you give me a call when you can? So we can talk. You know that I love you. You're my little girl. Bye. Miss Summy Bennati is requested at the cafe. Summy Bennati. - Sandro. - Hey, kiddo. - Hi. Have you seen my mom? - No, there's no one here. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday, dear Summy ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday, sweetie. Come on, Mom. I said not to. Yes, I know. Come on, blow. - Blow. - Come on, blow! Quick, or the wax will melt! Come on, blow! So... who's that guy? He's friends with my mom. He looks like a loser. That's what he's counting on. He realizes that Mom is fond of charity cases. Why isn't Edo here? He's probably with his dad. Did you guys fight? - No. - He could have taken today off. Explain it to me, because that's no excuse! - Is she talking to your father? - Probably. - I'll go listen. - What did I ask for? Did I ask for that much? Seriously? No, you... For fuck's sake, listen to me. You promised me, okay? You promised me. It's her fucking birthday, she's turning 18 and you swore you'd come! - I'll take this one. - Oh, nice choice. Want to try it on here? Dumb joke... That'll be 20 euros. Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Edo, did you see her? With that smile, the nice figure... Enough, Dad. I meant for you. Looked like she had a fine body. What are you doing, always fiddling with that thing? It's a complex text. - And how long will it take? - A while. Is it to a girl? It's to Summer. I'm hungry, and you're thirsty. Let's go to the cafe. - I'm thirsty? - Yes, I can tell. - And the store? - We'll just close it. - How? - You wanna know how? Let me show you a magic trick. It starts like this. See? Store's closed. Let's go. - What if someone comes? - If someone comes... Come on, Edo, has anyone ever died from buying flip-flops half an hour late? Have they? Let's go. You definitely look thirsty. - So? - What kind of present is this? What do you mean? It's a guitar. - But it's yours. - It was mine. Now it's yours. - I don't know how to play it. - Exactly! - I'll teach you. Isn't that great? - Okay. It's from Dad, too. Mom, this is your guitar. It's not from Dad. Listen, I know it's not a great party, - but maybe tonight we can... - Summy's booked tonight. All right. Then, when can we celebrate? This weekend? - Perfect. - I'll bake a cake. - Okay. - All right. - Bye. - Bye. Call me. Don't forget. - See you tonight. - Yeah. So maybe you'll stop thinking about him. - Who? - What do you mean, who? If you mean Ale, I haven't heard from him in 18 days. - In 18 days? - Nineteen, counting today. Do you think it's normal that you're counting the days? Come on, you'll be late for work. Come on, Mom... close that window. Ale... Enough. I can't stand seeing you like this. Please, pull yourself together. Hey... Will you tell me what's wrong? What's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. What's wrong... - Did you go see your dad? - No. When will you go, then? He's leaving today. - Jesus... - I'll go later. It's not just because of him, is it? What is it? Is it because of Maddalena? Did you two break up? Yeah, but that's not it. Ale... It's so miserable seeing you like this. Come on, get up. Show some sign of life. Come on! I think this is yours. I have to go. - Tidy up before you leave, please. - I will. Bye. You see, Edo... She still doesn't realize how much she likes you. You're kids, after all. It takes time. How much time? Eh... Summers come and summers go. What's that supposed to mean? - Every summer brings something different. - What about this summer? It's not the summer for you two. So do me a favor, Edo. This summer, just have fun. Otherwise, you'll regret it, look at yourself in the mirror and go, "Good God, what an idiot I was!" Got it? Oh, huh? Look over there. A new vacationer, I see. Vacationers are the best lovers of them all. They come here and forget everything. There's no more family, children, husband, boyfriend, work... It's as if nothing matters. They decide to love you, and they'll love you like no other. For one night, and that's it. In the morning, you open your eyes and... Poof! They're gone. Mom was a vacationer, too. Mom was different. Anyhow, I'll go back to the store. You stay here and finish your drink. - All right? - All right. Bye. HI SUMMY, HOW ARE YOU? HEY, YOU... HIYA! HOW ARE YOU? - What's up, Mick? - Hey, Ale. - Hey. - Hey. - How are you? - Fine. You? I'm good. - Are you leaving? - We got practice sessions tomorrow. Listen... The Assen race was amazing. - I saw you. Great job. - Thanks. I didn't think you'd show up. I've got the papers with me. You can sign them now, if you want. What do you have to sign? It's the termination of my contract. - I'll wait for you over there. - Yeah. - See you, man. - Bye. Where... Where do I sign? Here, where it says "signature." Perfect. Now you're free. That's what you wanted, right? Do I have to thank you? If you want.

For any question, don't hesitate to contact me.Bye-bye. Thank you. Dear Summy, it took me over two hours to write this text. I started it 100 times, but then I deleted it. I didn't know how to start, so eventually I decided to start this way, in the simplest, most ordinary way. Dear Summy. I don't know what you've been up to. We haven't seen each other, and we haven't spoken to each other. If you want to keep things that way, that's fine by me, too. I don't know how it feels to be 18. I'm not there yet. But I believe you'll feel that it's a better world out there, because it's now at your fingertips. I imagined this day time and time again. And I imagined I would have spent with you. But life is strange, as this summer has taught me more than any other. So, today, we're apart. I'm sure that you'll spend the day with him. The motorcycle guy. All I wanted to say is I hope that you'll have a marvelous day. And I hope you're happy. Edo. - Hi! - Hi. - You must be Edo, Loris' son. - Yes. Nice to meet you, I'm Giulia. - Yes, but I was about to... - It's really nice here. Not really... I really envy you. You get to live here all year long. - Why, where do you live? - Vicenza. There are no beaches there. But you have them all year long. - And it's full of clubs... - Actually, this place is a shithole. It's dead in the winter, and then we're invaded by tourists. I like it. And you're all so cheerful. Even your father. - How do you know him? - I'm here camping with my parents. Loris told me so much about you. He told me I'd find you here. He said you'd show me all the local sights. Yeah, but it's not like there's that much to see here. That's too bad. Is it true you speak German? Did he tell you that? Will you say something in German? - No, come on... - Just one word. - No, seriously. - Just one, then I'll go. - It's embarrassing. - Tell me just one word. Uh... Gesundheit. Which means? Bless you. Your father was right. You're really funny. Were you spying on me? - No, I... - You were spying on me. - I just happened to see you inside. - What do you want? I want to know how she is. Ale, I don't like you. You made my friend suffer, so you can't be my friend. I didn't make her suffer. She just doesn't answer. I called her over and over. Because she doesn't want to hear from you. You're out of her mind by now. But why? Because she doesn't trust you anymore. She doesn't. - Can we have a drink and talk? - No. - How about a walk? - Bye. Who's that for? For her. A gift? Today's her birthday. It's today? But don't get any funny ideas. She's not the celebrating type. Don't go to her. Ale... I mean it. Ale, listen to me! Ale! Hey! Can I help you? - Uh... - No way! You're Blue, Summer's sister! Good God, you're all grown up! - I have the keys. - The keys? They're Edo's. He left them at our place. Sorry, but Edo went out. He's out running errands. But I can give them to him if you want. I wanted to do it myself. I thought I'd see him at my sister's birthday party, but he didn't come. It's my fault, actually. I asked him to stay here at the store. You know, the camping ground is full, so there is a lot of work. That's why he couldn't come. Um, but if you want to leave him a message... I'll come back later, thank you. Okay. Oh! Say hi to Isabella for me. I haven't seen her in ages. Yeah, anyway... What's that? - It's a gift. - What is it? Come on. - Let me see. - No. - Do you know who I ran into coming here? - Who? - Ale. We had a chat. - About Summy? Yeah. I know. He told me. He's hurting. Summy as well. Ale may be too superficial to get it, but Summy is actually really sensitive. She's still a girl, you know? Sofia... You! We always talk about Summy, Ale... other people. But we never say anything about you. Maybe because there's nothing to say? Fair enough. You don't want to talk. I'll stay here, then. Bye. Okay. Today is Summer's birthday, and I wanted to spend the day with her. That's a start. What else? She's working, so I'll see her tonight. It used to be our day, but not this year. So you'll spend the day with me. You smiled. Have you spoken to Maddalena? - Yes, she's fine. - How many messages per day? - Four or five. - Four or five? Disappointing. - Disappointing? That's a big improvement. - What do you talk about? Well, I write her tons of stuff. But she's suffering. She talks about Ale, and how she's hurting. - That's not necessarily a bad thing. - You think? Yeah, it means she trusts you, so as soon as she gets over Ale, you... Huh? - You never give up, do you? - Never. I like it. We have lunch, breakfast, and dinner at 7:30 to 10:30, 12:30 to 2:30 and 7:15 to 9:35. Okay. Thank you, Summer. - You're welcome. - Summer! What a lovely name. Thank you. Bye-bye. She should be over there... no. I don't know... Try the pool, maybe she's there. - The pool? - Yeah, try there. Bye. Summer? What are you doing there? No, it's just... I was looking for... - That thing with the name. - The badge? The badge, yes. Here it is! This one! Found it. - Now stand up. - Yes. Bye. - I'm here for anything you need. - All right. So he did find you, after all? - Did you make up? - No. - But you took the flowers. - I didn't... Looks like you did to me. I picked them up, because he left them there. Take them. I don't want them. - They're yours. - No, take them. - They're so nice. - I'll throw them away. If you insist, I'll take them. There's a note. Here. These days, nobody gives flowers. Or better yet, I never got flowers as a gift. It's kind of old school, but very romantic. So, why did you run away? I don't know. I understand if you're afraid, but what's the worst that can happen? One has to take some risks, eventually. Don't you think? Look how pretty they are. No good? It's super romantic, Dario. I wish I got a song like this. Really? "Snail Slime." - Snail what? - Snail slime. It's the title of the song. See... It's a bit like the traces we leave behind. You know how everyone walks his own path in life? Just like snail slime, you don't see it, but its traces are there. We carry them with us, right? It's like in life: you're born, do things, and then you leave them behind. - Dario, the title sucks. - Does it? - Yes. - Yeah. You think? Maybe we can work on it. We can find another one, so I can send it. - What are you doing? - I'm doing you a favor. - No. Did you send it to her? - Of course I did. It's beautiful. What are you worried about? No! The bit at the beginning wasn't... - It wasn't ready to be sent. - It's gone now. That's it. - So now what? - We wait. Come in. - Hi, Summer. Come in. - Good morning. You wanted to talk? You're done for the day. What do you mean? - You can go. - Why? What have I done? If it's about the badge... I admit it, it wasn't because of that. Why didn't you tell me it was your birthday? Uh... I didn't think it was that important. Of course it's important. Turning 18 is important. Now, off you go. You have the rest of the day off. Thank you. Happy birthday. I knew it, we shouldn't have sent it. What did I tell you? - Did she see it? - No, not yet. So? Why worry? You're right. Anyhow, what you told me earlier about Ale. You were right. - About the fact he's superficial? - No. It's hard to tell what he wants. Or what he thinks. A bit like you. - She's seen the text. - Let me see. She's writing. No... you take it, I don't want to watch. Don't tell me a thing, I don't want to see. She answered. What's with that look? - I knew it... I even told you. - She said it's amazing. - Really? - Yes. She's still writing! She's asking me why I sent it. Tell her. For starters, she likes it. HI. I REALIZE YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE ME ANYMORE AND THAT YOU DON'T EVEN WANT FLOWERS FROM ME BUT I WANTED TO GIVE YOU BACK SOMETHING THAT'S YOURS HAPPY BIRTHDAY JUST KIDDING ♪ We would begrudgingly drink Elderberry liqueur ♪ ♪ And I'd pour too much Sweet-and-sour sauce on the noodles ♪ ♪ And we covered the smoke detector With our socks ♪ ♪ Single room number 2E ♪ ♪ And we'd spend the days eating in bed ♪ ♪ Sleeping on Kellogg's crumbs ♪ ♪ Us, under the ribs of an umbrella folded By the wind ♪ ♪ Too small to accommodate both ♪ ♪ I'd tell you I'm here by chance... ♪ Perfect.

What can I say? Is it heavy? It's kind of you to carry the water. There was no need. See? You're kind, as well as nice. Your father told me that as well. How do you say "kind" in German? Freundlich. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I like it when you speak German. That's my tent. - That one? - Mm-hmm. - The three of you sleep there? - No, my parents sleep in the big one. - They let you sleep alone? - Of course. So if I want to invite someone in, I can. Ah. Your father didn't tell me the most important thing. What? That you are so handsome! Put it there. Thanks. I'm going to take a shower. Will I see you tomorrow? Wait... I don't have your number. Where will we meet? Around... I'll see you around. Okay. Shh. I told you you'd hear it. - Good evening. - Good evening. Excuse me, I'm looking for a friend who works here. She was supposed to finish a while ago, but… - You mean Summy? - Yes. - Are you Sofia, her friend? - Yes. - Summy left early today. - Is something up? She didn't mention it. Yes, well... what happened is that Ale, the guy she likes, came looking for her and brought her these flowers. Beautiful, right? And then she left. I think she finally made up her mind. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - All right, I'm turning everything off. - Let's go. Okay. We've done our duty for the day. - Bye, Loris. - Bye, Titti. - What's with that grin? - What grin? That one. - What is it? - It's nothing, Dad. I know that smile. "It's nothing, Dad." Good boy. Shit. Shit. Shit, it's really late. - It's late? - Almost midnight. - So? - Wait. So... Shit. Let's see... What are you doing? Go on, blow. Come on, blow.
