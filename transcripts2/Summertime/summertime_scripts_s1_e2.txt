 Yes? Yes, okay. Perfect, thank you. See you. - Who was that? - The lady from the hotel. - And? - She wants to meet tomorrow. So the interview went well. I told you. - The guy from the party might be there. - What party? - Who? - The one you saw again at the interview. I don't know. Maybe they didn't hire him. - Who? - Some guy... who I think she totally has the hots for. - Last one there is a rotten egg! - No! Come on! He's not bad, you know? But he's almost a second short. He's no Ale. He's got potential, though. Nice work, Jacopo. It went well, right? Yes, apart from a few things we'll talk about later. Well done. Always a pleasure. I'm going back to work. - Maurizio. - Yeah? What is it? We invested two years of work and resources into Ale. He asked me for some time off. The accident must have scared him. It's normal. He's young. He needs time. Talk to him. Try to convince him. We're already late. Tell him that my team can't wait anymore. For your sake as well, because if Jacopo doesn't win, there is no point in having you here. PARADISE BEACH - My darlings! - Hi, Mom. Hi! You're so pretty. Sandro, have you seen Blue and Summy? Here I am. Summy! Blue! You two have grown so much. I bet all the boys are chasing after you. Here, have a piece of candy. - I'll take this one. - Yes. Here. - No, thank you. - Come on, they're good! Take one. Sandro, can you bring me two sunbeds? I'll be right there! - Can I have a popsicle? - Sure. - Now? - It's only a popsicle. What harm will it do? - Can you stay here and help me? - No. - I need to go right away. - Who'll stay with her? - You. - I'm here. - Don't worry. - Okay, thank you. - Thank God for Edo. Where are you going? - They called from the hotel. What great news! Sorry, we have to celebrate. Come on, Mom. It's not certain, yet. - I'll call you later, okay? - Okay. I'll back off. - Bye. - Break a leg. Break a leg! Summer's so pretty. - I did a good job. - You sure did. This is the kitchen. There you see frozen food for the restaurant. - And this is Marco. - Hi. One of our waiters. Here is where breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served. You should learn the hours by heart, as people ask that all the time. - Sure. - It's 7:30 to 10:30, 12:30 to 14:30, and 19:15 to 21:35. That's the pool. It opens at 10:00 and closes at 21:00. The tennis courts are over there. Milena, I'd like you to meet Summer. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Hi, there. What I need is someone to help her out here at the reception. - Okay. - She'll need a hand with everything. - Yes. - Whenever it's necessary. Shall we start tomorrow? Perfect. You'll figure out the shifts with her. You'll explain to her how things work here, and then you'll send her to my office. - All right. - Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. But the hour's not up yet. - I've had enough. - Aren't you Ale Alba? No. Nice. - You mean it? - No. I'm kidding. It's really great. No, I mean... I need to add something to it. I don't know whether it needs a clap or a kick. I said it was cool. Thanks, but I still need to finish the beat. - Does it gross you out? - No. You're a Virgo, right? What do you mean? You always seem so precise, even with music. You have great attention to detail. I'm a Leo, actually. Mmm. You don't strike me as one. You might have an Earth ascendant. Well, now that you mention it, maybe... - I think you do. - It's an Earth one. Listen, would you like to hear another track? Yeah. But not here. Let's go to my place. I mean, I don't mean to... It's just that I have a nice setup with a computer, speakers... - Yes. - All right, then. - Let's finish the beer, though. - Okay. ♪ When you are here with me ♪ ♪ This room no longer has any walls ♪ ♪ But it has trees ♪ ♪ Infinite trees ♪ ♪ When you are next to me ♪ ♪ This purple ceiling ♪ ♪ No, it no longer exists ♪ ♪ I see the sky above us ♪ Excuse me... It's this one. - It still needs some... - It's fine. - What are you doing? - What are you doing? Uh... Sorry, it's my fault. I should have told you earlier. - You've got a boyfriend. - No. Dario, I'm into girls. No... - Oh, boy. Seriously... - Why? Are you a homophobe? No, a homophobe? It's just... So, what is it? - It's nothing. - Tell me. Earlier on, when you said you liked my music, I started fantasizing. I thought that, in some way... But I do like your music. I honestly said that. I'm always honest. For instance, what you just did... What did I do? "Hey, Sofia, do you mind if we fuck?" I didn't do that. And I didn't say that, either. - Please, that is so 1980s. - That's not true. I didn't do it that way. Well, you just need to update a few things. - Anyhow, all the better for you. - You reckon? Mm-hmm. As a friend, I could give you plenty of tips. - Cool place. Is it all yours? - What? - Is this place all yours? - No, it belongs to my boss. It was part of the workshop. I fixed it up a bit, and now I live here. You're the first girl who has come here. - Then, I'm lucky. - No... I think I'm the lucky one. This looks amazing. No, don't touch that. Sorry. Is it yours? No, I'm building it with a friend. He's a Moto3 rider. Do you race, too? No, I'm a mechanic. It's a bit of a long story. He's like a brother to me. He came here from Rome, and I followed him. But if things go well, I'll work with him as part of the team. Ale's great. He's a true champion. Ale... The guy who was at the party? Yeah. Hm. - What are you reading? - Hi! I just bought it. You're late, Sofi. How did it go? I'd say it went well. - I'm starting tomorrow. - Hey, awesome! - So dinner's on you tonight. - Sure. Anyhow... was he there? No, he wasn't there, Sofi. And who cares, seriously? Are you disappointed? No, I don't really care. Then you won't care about what I just found out, either. What is it? Come on, tell me. - He's friends with Dario. - Who's Dario? Anyhow... we'll talk about it at dinner. - Where do you want to eat? - I don't know. - Who's that? - It's Sissy. She's into you. - Is Sissy the one with those huge tits? - No, that's Marty. The nun, come on. Sissy is... the lip balm one. Wait... lip balm? Ale, you tell him. - She sucks it with lip balm on. - Wow. Are you jealous? Go fuck yourself, man! - You're an asshole. - I mean... why? She's Madda's best friend. - How about you and that girl? - Yeah... All good. Good, meaning that you fucked her? No. Did she blow you? No. - Then, a handjob? - No. What? Guys, she's a lesbian. The fuck are you laughing at? Introduce her to me. I'll help convert her. - You're born like that. - No, that's not true. My cousin was with a guy, and now she's with a girl. - Maybe's she's bi. - Who knows. Want to roll another one? Let's do it. But someone needs to make a filter. I'll do it, guys. I'll go. I think I'm into a girl. Here, come on. - I might know who it is. - What do you mean? - The black girl from the party? - No... how do you know? The lesbian told me. - How the fuck does she know? - They're best friends. - No way... - Yes. - I'll be damned. - Do you like her this much, or... I'm afraid I really like her. Guys, it's ready. Hey. Hi, Mom. Have you talked to Dad? No. What are you going to do? I thought I'd go to bed. I'm being serious. As far as I'm concerned, you can stop racing altogether, or take all the time you need. Basically, do whatever the hell you want. But you need to make a decision. Maybe I'll find a job. Huh? Bye, Mom. Good night. Okay... ♪ Like the morning glow ♪ ♪ Like the sun that you should know ♪ ♪ Like you feel nothing at all ♪ ♪ You're like swimming in deep water I'm not ready ♪ ♪ I'm just me, and you're so many... ♪ - Hi. - Hi, Mom. Keep playing. Continue, please. ♪ I'm just me, and you're so many ♪ ♪ And the river flows And I should drink it all ♪ I can't. - I didn't see you coming in. - I just got here. - Where's Blue? - Sleeping. It's too bad you weren't with us tonight. Why? What did I miss? Nothing. We got a pizza, watched some TV... Oh. Sorry, I was with Sofi. She had stuff to tell me, so... You didn't tell me how it went today. It went well. Really well, actually. I'm starting tomorrow. Mom... what's wrong? Mom... What's wrong? It's just... it's hard. At night. Because you see me during the day. I can do anything. But at night, I feel... sad. I feel lonely. I know, Mom. And it's a bit harder in the summer. Yes, it is. But at least he's happy, playing music. No, Mom. It's not fair. You were singing. You never sing. You shouldn't have given up on music. I'm proud of you. You know that, right? - Yes, Mom. I know. - Okay. Because you're much better than me. Much better. You hear me? If you don't know, you need to understand. Come on. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. - Yes. - Come on. - Bye, darling. Have a good night. - Good night, Mom. - Okay. - Yeah. - Good night. - Good night. BIKES & RACES IS THE CHAMPION BACK? IS THE CHAMPION BACK? ALE SPEAKS AFTER THE ACCIDENT But... is this mandatory? Of course it is. Why? No, I was just curious. It's an advantage we give to our customers. They know our names, but we don't know theirs. So that immediately puts them at ease. But don't worry. Everything is going to be fine. The first thing a customer wants to see is a lovely smile. Try it. Exactly. That's excellent. I'll see you upstairs. ♪ Someone said they left together ♪ ♪ I ran out the door to get her ♪ ♪ She was holding hands with Trevor ♪ Can we drop our bags here? ♪ Not the greatest feeling ever... ♪ Good morning. These are check-in and check-out times, and here's the Wi-Fi password. No, I'll call someone. Wait. Okay. Can you send someone to pick up the bags? Thank you. He's coming. - Good morning. - Good morning. ♪ The less I know the better ♪ Are these the bags? - The luggage, I mean. - Yes. First day? Me, too. Summy? - Yes, sorry. - Thanks. Shall we go? Summer... What a peculiar name. What year was the hotel built? In 1923. To the left, please. In 1923? The hell I know? This is your room. If you have any questions, you can ask me. Thank you. This is yours. - Okay. Bye-bye. - Have a nice day. Anyhow, I'm Alessandro, which is not quite as peculiar a name. Everyone calls me Ale. All right, Ale. You can call me Summy. Why? Does everyone call you that? Only people I like. Okay... Summy. But, don't worry. This time I won't hit on you. Three floors, that's not enough time. Anyhow, I wanted to apologize for the other day. What happened at the party wasn't cool. So I just wanted to apologize. Okay. Apology accepted. I need to give you your hoodie back. - No, you can keep it. - No, I'm happy to give it back. You don't like it? - Listen, where are you from? - From here. No, I mean... originally. I was born and raised here, originally. - Okay, I was just asking because... - Because I'm black. - No. - No. I was asking because I'm not from here. I noticed. - Can you tell? - Yeah, a little. - Because of my accent? - Yes. How come you're working here? I mean, this particular place, this particular job? I needed some space to become financially independent. Yeah, I get it. - It's the same for me. - Cool. Excellent. This job's really important for me. For me as well. Seriously. So you only had one interview, too? - The other day, when we met. - Oh, yeah! Sure, yeah. One interview, and I got in. Didn't you ride motorbikes? Yeah. How did you know? Let's just say I know. That's a long and complicated story. I had some problems with my parents and... - Sorry. - I might tell you about it later. You don't have to, if you don't want to. - Guys. - Yes. Okay, perfect. - 'Morning. - Good morning. - Don't worry. We'll take care of this. - Okay. Please, this way. - 'Morning. - 'Morning. - What are you doing? - Huh? - What are you doing? - I've got something to do. I'll be right back. Madda. - Ale. - What happened? - I called you a thousand times. - I noticed. I'm working, though. We need to talk. About what? - You want to talk now? - I miss you. - I'm in pain. - Oh, God... - Can't we stay together? - Madda, I said no. - I've already told you. - But why? Because it's over. Things just end. Is there someone else? What does that have to do with anything? It's not that. It's not that. - You like someone else? - It's not that. Calm down. Can we take a walk and talk? Come on, let's have a word. Come... Come on, let's take a walk and have a word. This is your room. Thank you. Where is our luggage? I'll bring it right away. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hey... everything okay? - Yes. Wait, I'll give you a hand. - Where's Ale? - He's upstairs. Why isn't he here with you? He was here with me, but then he went upstairs. He went upstairs, then came down... I mean, first he went up, then came down, and he went back up. All right, let's just go. It's likely my fault. I came up too quickly, and he took the stairs, but he'll be waiting for us upstairs. You don't need to cover for him. - No, it's not that... - I know what Ale's like all too well. - You do? - Yeah. And I think giving him this chance was a mistake. No, don't say that. He seems like a nice guy, after all. You think? That he's a nice guy? Maybe the point is that mothers and sons shouldn't work together at all. Hey. - I looked all over for you. - What are you doing in here? I was looking for you, and now I found you. It's the women's locker room. You can't stay. Yeah, well. If anyone comes in, I'll leave. Suit yourself. Are you mad at me? Did anything happen? No? All right, then. Sorry about earlier on. I had a family issue to tend to. A sort of emergency. You mean with your mother? No... why? You're a liar. - Why am I a liar? - I saw you earlier with your girlfriend. She's not my girlfriend. She's my ex. Who cares? You're still a liar. Why? "I need this job, some me time and to challenge myself." Why didn't you tell me? I don't talk like that. Was I supposed to tell you about my ex? - Who cares about your ex? - Then, what? That the hotel manager is your mother. Well, I hadn't thought of that. You didn't ask. And to think that I was stupid enough to cover for you. It doesn't seem like such a big deal. You're an asshole. Hey! Asshole? We've just met. All the better. I can't believe this one... Hey, Summy. Hey. - Why are you here? - How did it go? I'm so glad to see you. - Hey, what's the matter? - Nothing. Why? - You never hug me like that. - Come on, that's not true. Anyway, I brought you a present. - Look. New ball bearings. - Thank you! - Want to fit them? - No, maybe later. - Shall we go? - Okay. Let's go. Come on guys, let's have fun. Drink up! Second round for you, and the third is coming up. - Two and three... Let's do it this way. - No, come on. Oh, come on! - What are you doing? - Give me some glasses. - What's the matter? - What? - What's going on? - Nothing, I'm fine. Why? No, that's not true. It's all messed up. I had a fight with Maddalena. Did you break up? - Are you sure? - No. No, actually... I talked to her, and I told her that I don't want to be with her anymore, but she still wants me. Is she the issue, or you? I talked to her. Just as I always do. But she wants to be with me. - And the other one? - Summy? Yeah. And him? What is he doing here? I don't know, but he's probably here for me. - Can we talk? - Is something wrong? Why aren't you coming back? Did my father send you? - You're our top rider. - No, you are. - You've been waiting for this chance. - You know that's not true. Let's get a drink, so you'll calm down. Here, drink. I said drink. You're a fucking coward. Let's bet on it. Beat me, and I'll come back. - Find two decent bikes. - Dario! - Can you manage? Are you sure? - Yes. - Huh? - Yes! It's got short gears. Careful when you step on it. Got it? Go. - Let's go! - Come on! Now that I won, are you coming back? You won because you're better. You don't need me anymore. Oh, God... look at my parents. A bit of 1980s music, and they get horny again. - When did they get back together? - They actually never broke up. They went through a rough patch, but now it's over. They even started fucking again. Huh? How do you know that? I can hear them. Better than my parents, for sure. Look at my mother. What's wrong with her? She looks sad. Sure enough, she's alone. Oh, my God, I love this song!
