 [ LINE RINGING ] ♪♪ [ CELLPHONE VIBRATES ] [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS ] [ CELLPHONE VIBRATES ] ♪♪ LET ME INFORM YOU WHY YOU'RE HERE. POOR JUDGEMENT. YOU'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH MAYOR LANCASTER. COME ON, PICK UP. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GET CAUGHT UP. YOU NEVER THINK IT'S GONNA GO AS FAR AS IT DOES UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE, AND THEN YOU'RE DEEP IN A PILE OF SHIT OF YOUR OWN MAKING. IF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE, AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT IT IS, HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH A COWORKER COULD BE CONSIDERED ILL-ADVISED, BUT IT'S NOT ILLEGAL. SO YOU ADMIT YOU'RE IN A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH MAYOR LANCASTER? THE ONLY THING I'M ADMITTING IS I DO MY JOB AND I DO IT DAMN WELL. ALL OF MY CONTRACTS FOR THE CITY ARE ABOVE BOARD AND BEYOND REPROACH. -HMM. I MENTION YOUR AFFAIR WITH THE MAYOR, AND YOU IMMEDIATELY FEEL THE NEED TO START DEFENDING YOUR HANDLING OF CITY CONTRACTS. INTERESTING. AS AMUSING AS THIS LITTLE GAME HAS BEEN, I MUST BE GETTING BACK TO WORK. I'D SIT BACK DOWN IF I WERE YOU, MS. MANNING. ♪♪ ♪♪ WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU ACCUSING ME OF?

CHLOE, BUZZ ME AS SOON AS REYNOLDS ARRIVES. -MM-HMM. -THANK YOU. ♪♪ WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? I'M HERE FOR A BUSINESS MEETING. YOU'RE ALWAYS TELLING ME TO BE MY OWN BEST ADVOCATE, SO HERE I AM. A CONCESSION SPACE OPENED UP AT HARTSFIELD-JACKSON AIRPORT. -IT'LL BE PERFECT FOR BELLA TRU. -BELLA. 100 MILLION TRAVELERS PASS THROUGH THAT AIRPORT EVERY YEAR. IMAGINE THOSE TRAVELERS STOPPING BY A BELLA TRU BOUTIQUE. -YOU ARE BEING UNREALISTIC. -WHY? THERE'S A BIG PUSH TO GET MORE ATLANTA LOCALS IN THE AIRPORT, RIGHT? WHY NOT ME? BELLA, COMPANIES KILL FOR THOSE SPACES. I KNOW. LOOK, WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER. I'M SURE MY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT IS WAITING.

SHE'S TRYING TO BLOCK THE EMINENT DOMAIN ORDER, AND MY INVESTORS ARE GETTING NERVOUS. WE CAN'T HAVE THAT. TELL THAT TO YOUR FATHER. HE WAS SUPPOSED TO HANDLE THIS. I HAVE RESOURCES THAT MY FATHER DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT. I CAN SECURE THELMA'S PLACE FOR YOU. MAYBE EVEN BY THE TIME DADDY RETURNS FROM HIS GOLF TRIP. [ LAUGHS ] [ LAUGHS ] I LIKE YOUR STYLE. SHOW ME.

[ SCOFFS ] I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT. THE PUBLIC ALREADY MISTRUSTS BIG PHARMA. AN AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN DOESN'T HELP. NEITHER DOES LOOKING WEAK. OUR COMPANY DIDN'T SURVIVE THIS LONG BY CONSTANTLY APOLOGIZING. WE'RE NOT GONNA START NOW. COMPANIES CRUMBLE ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR HUBRIS. THIS ISN'T A GAME, LORI. AND YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW THAT? I'M A PURIFOY AND THE HEAD OF PUBLIC RELATIONS, NOT SOME SNOT-NOSE INTERN FROM THE MAILROOM. [ SIGHS ] ♪♪ OH, AND SINCE YOU'RE NEW, HERE'S A PIECE OF WISE ADVICE. STAY IN YOUR LANE.

WHAT'S ALL THIS SUGARCOATING FOR? MUST BE SOMETHING I DON'T WANT TO HEAR. WOULD YOU MIND IF I REMOVED MY JACKET? IT'S GETTING A TOUCH BIT WARM IN HERE. WOULDN'T YOU AGREE? YES, UM, GO RIGHT ON. SENIOR, I KNOW THAT YOU ARE THE SOLE OWNER OF THELMA'S PLACE AND NOT RONDELL. I'VE ALWAYS ADVISED MY COLLEAGUES TO COME AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT BUSINESS, BUT RONDELL ACTS LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN EXIST. HMM. IS THAT SO? I THINK IT'S A SHAME WE CAN'T SPEAK DIRECTLY TO YOU. WELL, WE'RE TALKING NOW, AIN'T WE? MAYORS HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING TO REVITALIZE THE BANKS FOR DECADES. THINK OF WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR EVAN'S LEGACY IF HE'S THE MAYOR THAT ACTUALLY DOES IT. YOU COULD HELP SEND EVAN STRAIGHT FROM CITY HALL TO THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION. THAT IS, IF RONDELL WILL LET YOU.

WHAT'S GOING ON IS SHE IS TRYING TO SELL YOU ON GIVING MAMA'S RESTAURANT TO A CROOKED-ASS WHITE SNAKE IN THE GRASS. SENIOR, YOU SAID SO YOURSELF. IT'S A REAL GOOD OFFER. SELL IT TO ME IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE. I'LL MAKE SURE THE FAMILY GETS THE BEST DEAL. FAMILY? YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE MEANING OF FAMILY. NOW, CARRY YOUR BONY BEHIND UP OFF MY BLOCK! SEE? THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, RONDELL! Y-YOU JUST ACTING LIKE I'M NOT EVEN HERE! -DADDY, LOOK -- -DAMN IT, GIRL! THE DECISION IS MINE AND MINE ALONE. I'LL BE IN TOUCH, STEPHANIE. I CANNOT WAIT, SENIOR. [ CHUCKLING ] [ DOOR BELLS JINGLE ] [ DOOR CLOSES ] AMARA HUGHES WAS THE ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY WHO PULLED YOU IN YESTERDAY? WHY DO YOU THINK I LEFT YOU SO MANY MESSAGES? SHE SAID I'LL FALL FIRST AND THE HARDEST. WHOA. NO ONE'S FALLING. THE CITY IS THRIVING. THAT'S ALL ANYONE CARES ABOUT. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] YOU DIDN'T LET MS. HUGHES GET TO YOU, DID YOU? A FEDERAL OFFICER WITH THE POWER TO SEND ME TO PRISON? YEAH, SHE GOT TO ME. DAPHNE, WE ARE SMART PEOPLE. WE'VE DONE SMART THINGS.

IT'S THE LAW OF ATTRACTION, HONEY. LIKE ATTRACTING LIKE. DAD, I WONDER IF YOU'LL STILL BE SPOUTING PASSAGES FROM "THE SECRET" WHEN OUR CHIEF PHARMACOLOGIST GIVES TITUS INFORMATION HE SHOULDN'T BE PRIVY TO. LIKE WHAT? HE'S OUR GENERAL COUNSEL. GENERAL ASSHOLE IS MORE LIKE IT. IS THAT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT? TITUS PULLING THOSE FULL-PAGE ADS YOU ORDERED? LORI, HE MADE THE RIGHT CALL. DAD, HE'S AN ARROGANT, KNOW-IT-ALL, JIZZ STAIN WITH A SAVIOR COMPLEX. TELL ME HOW YOU REALLY FEEL. LOOK, I GET IT.

POP, I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, BUT I C-- IT'S TOO HIGH A PRICE TO PAY FOR A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT'S ALREADY GONE. YOU GOT DRUG DEALERS AND DEVELOPERS NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU TURN. IT'S BETTER TO GET OUT AND HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW FOR IT. BUT I'M HAPPY TO SEE YOU COMING TO ME LIKE THIS. LETS ME KNOW YOU'RE NOT WITH THEM. AT LEAST ONE OF THOSE RUMORS FLOATING AROUND ABOUT YOU AIN'T TRUE. DON'T BELIEVE NONE OF THEM, POP. WHEN YOU WERE ELECTED, I WAS SO PROUD. THOUGHT, "MY BOY THE MAYOR... [ LAUGHS ] "...YEAH, HE'S GONNA HELP MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR THE FOLKS AROUND HERE," LIKE YOU WERE REALLY GONNA REMEMBER WHERE YOU CAME FROM AND LIFT ALL OF US UP LIKE "THE TALENTED TENTH." JUST MAGICAL THINKING. LOOK, PAPA, DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. OKAY. SELL, DON'T SELL. RONDELL WILL BE FINE EITHER WAY. I GOT HER BACK. THAT MUCH, AT LEAST, I CAN PROMISE YOU. AS FAR AS THE WAY SHE TREATS YOU, WELL, WE LANCASTERS HAVE A MESSED-UP WAY OF SAYING, "I LOVE YOU." ♪♪ BUT YOU KNOW SHE DOES. ♪♪ ♪♪ [ DOOR BELL JINGLES ] ♪♪ [ DOOR BELL JINGLES ] ♪♪ MRS. LANCASTER. ♪♪ WELCOME TO BIRMINGHAM. DAMIAN COLLINS, IT'S SO GOOD TO FINALLY MEET YOU. ♪♪ NEXT TIME ON "AMBITIONS"... YOU GOT ANOTHER THING COMING. OFFICER, PLEASE REMOVE THIS GARBAGE. CARLISLE-PERKINS COULD USE AN ATTORNEY WITH YOUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE. BRIBING A JUDGE IS NOT WHO I AM, HUNTER. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY LAWS YOUR BREAKING RIGHT NOW? -IS THIS A VENDETTA? -NOT AT ALL. YOU LYIN' BITCH. I CAN MAKE YOUR LIFE A LIVING HELL. YOUR THREATS ARE AS EMPTY AS YOUR PROMISES.
