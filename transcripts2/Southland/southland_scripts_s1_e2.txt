 Southland (2009â€“2013): Season 1, Episode 2 - Mozambique - full transcript 
 Overconfident after near-unanimous praise on his first beat day, Ben jumps in at a shop-mugging only to find he failed to arrange backup or make sure who the victim and robber are. Officer Dewey Dudek celebrates his retirement form active duty, aiming at a Hollywood career. Another retired cop is asked to mind an active colleague's neglected dog. Detective Nate Moretta's potential police recruits program is the only way for detective Sammy Bryant to provide some protection for a rare wiling witness in a fiendish neighborhood. An alleged father suffers third strike after the mother dumps 'their' baby on him.

 (baby crying) WOMAN: Can you remove the clothes? I need to take a picture of his body. (baby crying) (crying continues) MAN: Detective Lydia Adams, at the end of a very long day, had to give up a baby. It wasn't the first time. You know what a Mozambique is? BEN: Uh, Failure drill, right? Two the body, one to the head? Yeah.

 Used to be called the Mozambique. PC crap-- nothing can be called what it is. You know why they call it the Mozambique? Nah. Those crazy revolutionary dudes over there used to chew this drug called "khat." Mm-hmm. Hits the nervous system. It's like amphetamine. You chew the leaves, you're impervious. Hey, hey! Hey. I told my wife about you. Good job, son. (chuckles) Thank you. Dewey's an asshole, but he's one of us.

 Yeah. All right. Thanks. Have a good one. Yeah. All right, anyway, 1974-- this soldier, he's defending the airport there, right? Got a sidearm. This khat-chewing crazy-ass fucker, he comes running at him with an AK-47, firing bullets. They were just spraying bullets everywhere. He's missing him, right? Yeah. So the soldier fires two to the center mass. The khat-chewin' bastard, he doesn't feel it. They don't put you up for the Medal for this, something's wrong. (laughs) Thank you. JOHN: Yeah. For the whole 30 seconds he's been on the job, he definitely deserves the Medal of Valor. You done us proud. Thank you. CHICKIE: Six-eight-47, show us clear. So, after the double-tap, soldier fires one to the head-- right between the eyes. You know why? Yeah, there's no bone to deflect the bullet. Bang! He goes down. So, seriously-- where'd you learn to shoot? Beverly Hills Gun Club. Thought you knew. You're fucking with me. CHICKIE: I don't think so. Get in the back, Spago. Sorry. (dog barking) I think your wife's been blogging my wife. She's been getting all pissy with me suddenly. (barking continues) I'm gonna kill that fucking dog. (barking continues) MAN (slurring): He owes me money... ANDY: Okay. and he said he wasn't, he said he wasn't gonna pay me back, no, sir. That's not right at all. ANDY: How much money he owe you, sir? How much does he owe you, sir? Three dollars. Are you kidding me? Three dollars? That's what he owes you? You're missing the point here. He said he wasn't gonna pay me back! This is a bad economy. All right. We're done here. Uh, guy says he did it; we have witnesses. It's a ground ball. Kenny and I will-- we'll wait for S.I.D. KENNY: We're good. Go ahead. You sure? Yeah, yeah. Sammy, you need a ride back? Yeah. Janila? Sweetheart, what are you doing? I live down the street. Really? Yeah. They haven't moved you yet? No. (sighs) (clears throat) So how are you? Okay. I heard from this boy at our school that you guys, like, have junior police kids work for y'all. What we have is the Explorers program. And, actually, Detective Moretta helps run it. Remember him? Hi. You want to be an Explorer? What all does it consist of? Well, it's, uh, it's basically for kids who think they might want to go into law enforcement. We'll meet up once a week; we train you; you'll move through the ranks, just like in the academy, and, uh, you get to train other kids. I'll join. (detectives chuckling) NATE: That was easy. SAMMY: You know, you're already helping us out by testifying. You know that, right? Yeah. But it's very important that you don't go telling people about it. Remember? We talked about that. So, what are you gonna say about Dewey? I know it's really weird... I kinda like the guy. He's kind of a turd. (Chickie laughs) Whoa! Whoa! 211 in progress! Gun! Gun! (tires screech) JOHN: Hey, hey, wait! Hey! Where you going? (man shouting in Arabic inside) (shouting in Arabic continues) (panting rapidly) Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun now! (shouting in Arabic continues) Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun or I will shoot you! (shouting continues) Drop the gun! Put it down! Put it down! Turn around! Turn around, put your hands on the glass! (man speaking Arabic) Hands on the case! Hands on the case! Shut up! (man speaking Arabic) You! Outside now! Go! Go! (man shouting in Arabic) Go now! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up now! Shut up! Down. Stay down! (speaking Arabic) Shut up. Shut up! (speaking Arabic) Yeah, shut up. About a hundred things you did wrong. This man, he works at this market. He was being robbed by this gentleman, who may or may not have a gun. Do you have a gun, sir? Dude got it off me. Yeah. You may be a great shot, but you still know shit about being a cop. CHICKIE: Sit up. Sit up! Number one: things aren't always what they seem. CHICKIE: Sit up. The victim can be the suspect; suspect can be the victim. Unhook him. Number two: you wait for us. You do not take action by yourself. Yes, sir. We work as partners. Yes, sir. Now you apologize to him. I'm very sorry, sir. You okay? He's new. You get his info. Yes, sir. CHICKIE: Let's go. (car alarm wailing in distance) Move over. Move over! Come on. That's good. CHICKIE: Six-eight-47, show us en route to the station with one in custody. DISPATCH (over radio): Six-eight-47, copy. Got caught up in the John Wayne syndrome. You lost your position of advantage. Yes, sir. Could've been a second, third suspect. Could've been a layoff man waiting to shoot at you. John... John! Stop the car! (tires screech) (horns blare) JOHN: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! Stop! JOHN: Stop! Okay. Hi. JOHN: I got it. What the heck? (horns honking) (baby fussing) LYDIA: Hey, there... (baby fusses) I don't know, maybe the mom ran to the store or something, got picked up; didn't tell the cops about the baby? RUSSELL: Maybe it was a carjacking. They look in the backseat, they see the baby, and they freak out and they dump it... Or maybe God dropped it down. You know, from Heaven. We're gonna stay here and keep canvassing the area. RUSSELL: Let us know if you have any answers, and we'll call Media Relations. Thank you. All right. Oh, man, Russell, we didn't bring a car seat. It's four blocks. You can just hold him. Look, just, you know, sit in the backseat, I'll drive real slow. Promise. Okay. He's a big man. Handsome little man. Isn't he? Let's go for a ride. SAMMY: This is our star witness in a gang trial. When was the last time you had a witness come forward like this, huh? Detective... How about never? There's a budget crisis. Maybe you've noticed? Okay? I'm sorry, we're not relocating them. This is bullshit. No, they're Hispanic gang members. She doesn't even live in their neighborhood. I don't see the threat here. Hello? They have these things called cars. Yeah, and so they're gonna go across town and try to find her in a black neighborhood. Yeah. Yeah. No, I don't think so. I'm late for court. (sighs) Just get her into the Explorers. You know she has to apply, right? I know, but no bullshit. I don't care if she's got D's in school. Just let her in. Don't worry about it, man. She's in. Hey, does my ass look big in these? RUSSELL: Okay, that was DCFS. They're sending over an emergency response worker. (baby crying) Media Relations hasn't even put out a bulletin. And you know what's gonna happen-- they're just gonna dump him in the system, just like they do with all of the other cases. (baby crying) LYDIA: Hey, buddy, let's get this diaper changed. (crying) Come on... (crying stops) (gently): Ooh... Man! What the hell! (baby crying) LYDIA (gently): Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Ooh-wee! A big load right there! Russ... Yeah. Look at this. FEMALE REPORTER: Today, in the Southland, a baby boy believed to be about ten months old, was found crawling across this street in Hollywood, according to the Los Angeles Police. Let me try that one more time. Hey! Anything else you can tell me? Nope. MAN: Officer! Officer... Is that baby okay? Yeah, it's fine. How you doing, shitbird? I'm a little high right now. Yeah? (both laughing) Yeah. So, uh, anything you can tell me? Maybe drug deal gone bad? Somebody tried to sell the kid? Something like that? No? Yeah? No. Okay. All right. Thanks. Hey, I just got off the phone with, uh, Riverside. There've got a mother who filed a missing baby report two days ago. So she's coming over here to see if it's hers. What? Well, she might have done something to her kid, 'cause her story's kind of hinky. And we're supposed to just hand this baby to her? Come on, Lyd. What if it's really her kid? So, uh, about Dewey's party... Wait, w-why do I have to go to this thing? N-Nobody liked him, right? I never even met the guy. It's a chance for you to meet some of my friends. Oh, y-you mean the wives? Yeah, what's wrong with that? Huh? I-I have nothing in common with these women! Nothing! You don't know that. They probably all belong to a nice little book club, read Ann Rice novels. You're being ridiculous, Tammi. I found this guy. Um, he's a retired cop out in Thousand Oaks. And he said he'd meet us there, take Richter. Tammi, it's better for the dog. He can run around, work off that energy. Fine. He's my only friend, and you want to take him away from me. You know that this is the right thing for him. The guy has goats. He can herd goats. (scoffs) Tam... You honestly think it's a good idea if she comes? No. She's gonna freak, bro. Dewey of all people. Come on, seriously. Can you imagine the freakin' speeches? There won't be any. (laughter) You coming, Kenny? Coming where? (laughter) Retirement party, man. You got to go. You didn't get the e-mail, seriously? No. (laughter) Hey, Janila. Hey, Janila! Hey, sweetheart, uh, come with me. I'll show you my friend who runs the Explorers. They said I had to get a sponsor. Will you sponsor me? Of course. Are you kidding? Um, they said that I had to have a parent sign it. But my dad's in jail, and my mom's on drugs. I live with my grandmother. You mean she's your guardian, yeah? Yeah. Perfect. Yeah, no problem. Come on. Have fun. You better be kidding me. No, no, I don't think it's a good idea. Come on, Sal. You don't think about me? Hmm? Don't you miss me? Of course I still think about you. A lot, all right? Way more than I should. Mia, that's my kid calling. I got to take this, all right? All right. Okay. Hey, Peanut, what's up? No, no, you cannot go to Hollywood Boulevard. Because I said so. Because it's filled with creeps trying to get over, that's why. I'm not gonna argue about this-- Hello? (knocking) Police! Yeah? How you doing? Have you seen this kid? What? No? No. Okay. You, uh, if you hear anything, give us a holler. It's police! What? I saw the baby climb out of a box. The baby? Yeah. It tipped over the box and just climbed out. (laughs): I mean... I thought I was hallucinating. (both laugh) And then you just let it crawl into traffic, right? No. No, no, no, no, no, no. I-I had split by then. I had to get some breakfast. You know, they serve this French toast over at the church... Barry, I need you to show me where the box was. Yeah. Okay? Yeah. All right, let's go. (indistinct radio chatter) Oh, I also got a partial plate. I'm gonna fucking kill you. So you saw a car drop off the box? No, I saw it drive away. The part that I saw read... "3D24." Of course, I need glasses. (chuckles) Want me to run it? I got it. CHICKIE: Well, do you know what kind of car it was? Yep. Oh, uh, it was a, um... El Camino. Red, '87, '88. The El Camino's registered to a Christi Cummings. C-H-R-I-S-T-Y? S-T-I. Okay, she's a 647b. Been arrested about ten times-- prostitution, drugs. I'm gonna call Vice and see if she's active. Any updates on Baby Doe? Yeah, someone saw a car drop him off. It's registered to a woman. We're gonna see if we can find her. Well, I need to open a case on the baby in the next 72 hours. I'm gonna put him in foster care tonight unless you tell me otherwise. Okay. Um, you got a card with a direct number I can call you? The baby? Oh, yeah, sorry. (crying) Gonna be all right. All right. Okay. I can't believe this scumbag. It's so over. He told me that he had to take the baby to the doctor, on account of his ex, Brianna, couldn't do it today. She's the mom. (chuckles) I wouldn't have lent him the car otherwise. He's such an asshole! We're gonna need scumbag's name. Skylar Joel. I'll run it. (indistinct radio chatter) OFFICER: Left, right, left, right, left, left. Left, right. Ready. Halt. Left face. About face. Perez! How big are you? What did you just say to me?! Big enough to knock you on your ass, sir! That's what I want to hear! Now, what are we gonna do? KIDS: Take back the neighborhoods, sir! I can't hear you! Take back the neighborhoods, sir! MORETTA: That's what I'm talking about! Kimmy, you've got to calm down. I can't understand a word you're saying. (siren, emergency horn in distance) Dad, they towed Mom's car! Kimmy, I told you not to take that car. Where are you? I'm on Hollywood Boulevard! You stay there. I'm coming to get you. Don't go anywhere. Fine. Just stay there. (rap music playing) This guy's got a, uh, ten-page rap sheet. Spousal abuse, drug possession, 211. Great. Hey. (door buzzer sounds) (TV playing muffled) SKYLAR: Who's there? Open the door, Skylar. (lock clicking) Hands! Hands! Get your hands in the air! Bathroom! Bathroom! You're under arrest. Clear! No way, man! Stop! RUSSELL: Gun! Gun! Gun! Stop! Suspect dropped their gun. I got it. All right, hold it right there, Skylar. Hold it. Stop! Requesting assistance at Westlake and 7th. Westside alley, eyes on suspect. (indistinct radio chatter) (siren whoops) RUSSELL: Hold it right there. Come on, Skylar. Turn around, put your hands above your head! I'm not going back to prison, man. No way! Drop your weapon! No way, man! You're going back. Drop! Stay where you are! Hold it right there. Drop the knife, Skylar. SKYLAR: No way, I'm not going back! Russell! You want to shoot him? Yeah! Hand me the less lethal. CHICKIE: Stay right where you are! Drop the weapon. Drop it right now. SKYLAR: Go away, man! I told you, I'm not dropping the knife! Right now, Skylar! No way, man! No way! (pounding on door) (grunts) Ow! God, man, no! Let's go! It hurt, man! Get up and spread your legs. SKYLAR: Oh, sh... COOPER: You got anything else on you? SKYLAR: No! (screams) CHICKIE: Six-Adam-four-seven. Show us how we forward our location. Suspect is in custody. What the hell was that? Bean bag. Please, don't shoot me with that again. COOPER: Don't go pulling knives on cops, asshole. I been shot, I been stabbed, and that hurt, man. (speaking Spanish) You gonna take care of my little girl? Consider it already be done. I'll take care of what need to be done out here. Gracias. I appreciate it. All right, my boy. She need to go to church. She needs structure. Well, Ms. Johnson, this is, uh, this is kind of like church. You smile like that, the girls just fall over, huh? I-I don't like her hanging around with you people all the time. Bad enough she testifying. I bought this house, this was a good neighborhood. Now look at it. Oh, you have no idea how bad it gets. Which is why she should do this. I promise, it's a good thing. I broke up with Marquece. That little fool. You should've done that a long time ago. That was fun. MAN: Newton turban! I don't understand why you're arresting me for trying to do the right thing. I mean, you're allowed to give up a baby. You know how many people tried to buy it off of me? I could've sold it, which I did not do. You can give up a baby within three days of birth to a hospital or a fire station. The building looked official, okay? It had converters and stuff. It was a power substation, you idiot. Where's the mother? That bitch broke up with me. Does she know what you did? I need to talk to the mother, Skylar. She tells me she wants to go straight. Then she gets some dumb-ass job, and every time she has a problem, she dumps the baby on me. And I don't even know if it's mine. I mean, she was screwing about ten guys at the same time. Her name. I need her name. Do you know why they towed the car, Kimmy? 'Cause it was in a tow-away zone. I'm sorry! You guys have got a way home, right? I'm gonna call your parents tonight, so the numbers you gave me better be right. You just humiliated me! Too bad. (phone rings) Is that Mommy? No. Who is Brianna? Could you tell her I need to talk to her about her son? Is this about Jimmy? Your ex, Skylar, decided to give him away. He thought it was for the best. We found him crawling down the street on his own. Oh, my God, is he okay? He's safe. Where is he? Children's Services has him. No. Once they get them, you can't get them back! I want to see my son now! Can I see him? No, not right now. DCFS has him, and he's safe. How did this happen, Brianna? I leave him with this woman while I work-- she's really good-- but she had an emergency with her own son at school, and so I told her to leave him with Skylar. I usually don't, but this was an emergency. According to Skylar, you leave the baby with him all the time. No. That's a lie. He hates me because I went straight. I... The minute I found out that I was pregnant with Jimmy, I stopped using. I got a job right away. I've never done anything to hurt him. I've been trying so hard. How'd he get the scar on his leg? He's like Houdini! He gets out of everything. He-he got out of his high chair and scraped his leg on the screw that was holding it together. I got it secondhand. I took him to get a tetanus shot right away. He has all his shots. So, we take him to the E.R., get some X rays-- we gonna find anything else? Some old broken bones, more scars? No! I love my son! He's all that I have. Please, please can I see him? MAN: Now, Dewey graduated from the academy in 1986. He wasn't the top of his class, but he wasn't the bottom-- but close. (laughter) Yeah. No-No Child Left Behind, you know what I'm saying? (laughter) His first assignment was South Central, where he did his probation. Now, he worked there from '86 to '88, when he was asked to leave. (laughter) Huh? I mean, that's something. He had 20 mouth-beefs at the time. That was a record back then. 21! Very nice, very nice. Now, in '98, he went over to Venice, beach patrol. Some say he learned how to drink there. I think he was working on his tan the whole time. (laughter) Riding around on a bicycle in a T-shirt and shorts... (continues indistinctly) That your BSS shrink? Uh-huh. How much longer do you have to do that? Uh, not much longer, I think. He uncovering all your deep, dark Beverly Hills secrets? Like what? You know who my father is, right? Scumbag defense lawyer, Ben Sherman? Yeah. Yeah. My father represented this drug dealer. Guy's brother went to jail. Dealer was pissed, thought it was my dad's fault. Had some people over to, uh, visit our house. Only problem was, that my dad had already walked out and left us. They were pretty pissed off. I was ten. After that, this kid I was in school with, his, uh, his dad thought I should learn to defend myself, so... he took me and his son to the gun club every Saturday. Taught us both to shoot. (people cheering, whistling in distance) You want another? No. I'm good. MAN: Just one tiny correction to make. Uh, in '98, when I went to Venice, I already knew how to drink, I just perfected it! (people shouting, clapping) Yeah! Venice rocked, man, Venice rocked. Everybody went around sporting bikinis... (whispers): Hey. Mia, hi. Hi, Sal. How you doing? I'm doing great. Great. This is my daughter Kimmy. Oh, hi, Kimmy. Nice to meet you. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Yeah, sure. (laughter) Whoa! Hey. Hey! Let me tell you something, if those guys saw me coming, they ran the other way! Aah! Why did you let him take the baby? I already told you, the woman I leave him with had an emergency. I'm trying to work with you here, but I have some very serious concerns. Can I see him, please? Not right now. Can I speak with you for a moment, privately? Brianna, give us a second? What's the problem? I'm gonna open a case, and she's very likely gonna lose this baby. I've worked with you people before, and this is not how you do things. You're not baby stealers; you keep the families together. She has a history of prostitution, she's a drug addict, and she gave the baby to a meth-addicted father. I think she... She's endangering the child. What if she's clean? What if I give her back the baby and it winds up dead in a week? You do your job, let me do mine. But you're not doing your job, you're judging her. The baby deserves a chance to grow up with his mother. Yes, she screwed up, but she's asking for another chance. Give it to her. Yes, can you send in Ms. Smith, please? Honey, this is my buddy Tom I was telling you about. He's gonna take Richter. Hi. How are you? Let's get this over with, all right? Okay, sure. We're gonna go put him in Tom's truck now, okay? Fine. So, Sammy said you have goats. 300 goats. It's a business, honey. Rent-a-Rumanant-- they clear brush. Fire prevention. No kidding? They clear brush faster than a crew. They never call in sick, no chemicals, no waste-- they're green as hell. Never thought I'd be one of those ecological do-gooders. Open up. Hey there, big fella. You want to help me herd some goats? (barking) Huh? You're confused, ain't ya? Bring him out. Come on, Tammi, let's do this. All right, all right. Come on! Give me a second! Come on. I know. Me, too. I miss you. I miss you. I miss you a lot. Not here, not here. Come on, Sal, one kiss. Sal. (groans) Most of all, I... (man whistles) wish you luck, Dewey, with... whatever you do in retirement. (scattered chuckles) Wow! (man shouts indistinctly) (chatter, whooping) My God, hey.... Hey, wait, did... did you write that speech yourself? (laughter) My God! DEWEY: What the hell do you mean you don't know what I'm gonna do in retirement? In case you haven't noticed this beautiful new uniform of mine, I'm gonna go to work on movie sets. (rowdy shouts, whooping) Hey, hey, they're gonna take one look at my ass on my motorcycle, and they're gonna make me (whooping) a star, baby! Yeah! Hey, and I got my boys in the back to thank for that. You guys just tell me how much I owe... Dad, she's so cool. What?! She's so beautiful. I've seen her on the news. You're being disrespectful towards your mother. Mom's a bitch. Shh! You will never talk that way about your mother, you hear me? Kimmy? Kimmy! You think he'll go back to prison? Yeah. Three strikes law. And he's got about eight. Child endangerment, child abandonment. He violated his parole with the drugs. Attempted murder on an officer. Good. They're not gonna let me have my baby back, are they? Probably not. I'm begging you to help me get Jimmy back. I'm begging you. Please. I need another chance. He's all I've got. (whimpers) (screaming): Stop! DEWEY: For those of you that don't know-- my beautiful wife. (cheers and whistles) I can't thank you enough for coming back to me. I'm sure it had absolutely nothing to do with my tax-free medical pension. (laughter) Where the hell's my shrink? My shrink is here somewhere. And my sponsor. In the back-- beautiful ladies. I want to bang you both! (laughter) I'm kidding. I'm kidding, sweetheart. Uh, you know, in all seriousness, you know, I-I know I messed up. They say I've got a disease called addiction. Personally, I just think I'm an asshole. But, uh, you know, I just want to say, that there hasn't been a day that's gone by-- drunk, sober-- that I haven't loved this job. I love this job. I love you guys. (phone rings, applause, cheers) (ringing continues) Let's have a couple drinks, all right? What is it, Janila? They shot up our house. What?! (tearfully): They shot up our house. Are you all right? We're okay. We'll be right there. Okay? I'm sending a squad car over. (rock music playing) (growling, fabric ripping) Were there ever drugs in the glove compartment? Come here. It's okay. Fucking kid. He borrowed it last week. (sighs) I can't take this dog. He could go nuts. Hurt a goat. It's okay. I-I totally understand. Don't worry about it. (helicopter circling overhead) She break up with the fool, you think he gonna take that lying down? Ms. Johnson, I realize you're upset. But I need you to calm down. SAMMY: Are you gonna help me out here or not? D.A.: I told you, we don't have the funds. The girl's an associate of Grape St. Who cares who it was! They're in real danger here. I'm sorry, we don't have the money. You're sorry. You wonder why we can't get anybody to testify? That was kinda sad. Yeah. Oh, my speech sucked. It was, uh, kind of anemic, I have to say. (chuckling) Uh, this is me. So, there's a lot more to that story, isn't there? People were in your house? Yeah. Where were you? I gotta go. Oka-Okay. See you. See you. Yeah. You aren't connected with your family? I was abused by my father. My mother looked the other way. Have you been in therapy to deal with all this? Yes. I saw someone from "Children of the Night" when I first got clean. Are you affiliated with a church? I mostly go to MCC in Hollywood. They're kind of gay, but they're really nice and I can bring Jimmy. Do you have a sponsor? There's this woman I talk to. She's really nice. It hurts! What hurts? Kimmy, what hurts?! I got my bellybutton pierced on Hollywood Blvd. You did what? Do you know how dangerous that is? Do you know you can catch HIV from that? Hep C! I want the name of the person who did it 'cause I'm shutting them down! Dad, will you stop yelling at me?! All you do is yell at me. I'm not yelling at you! Yes, you are! All right, look, I can start a file for her in the voluntary reunification program. Get her the support she needs. You can't parent in a vacuum. Thank you. Get her into a parenting group, appropriate day care. I need to take a picture of Jimmy, and then I need to see where she's living. Now? Tonight? That's right. Okay. (crying) Can you remove the clothes? I need to take a picture of his body. Seventy bucks. Change. I really appreciate what y'all are doing for me and my granddaughter. It's no problem. They have a pool. I'm a really good swimmer. My ass is on the line here and so is yours. I know. Thank you. Take care. (rings doorbell) Is he home? You called me. That was four months ago. You look good. What are you doing? I don't know. This mother lost her baby and... we found the baby crawling down the street by himself. One year old. Yeah, I heard about it on the news. The baby's back with his mom. I think they're gonna be fine. You okay? I think I made a mistake. You know? With you. I really do want a kid. I gotta... I gotta go inside. Yeah, I know. I know. You take care. (door closes) * All I can ever be to you * Is a darkness that we knew * And this regret I've got accustomed to * * It's my responsibility * You don't owe nothing to me * But, to walk away, I have no capacity * * He walks away, the sun goes down * * He takes the day, but I'm grown * * And in your way, in this blue shade * * My tears dry on their own.
