 What are you talking about? What's a seeker? Seeker is a hero who arises in a time of trouble and suffering. This is the sword of truth. In anyone else's hands it is a piece of steel, But in the seeker's hand bestows the power to fight evil. And with it you will kill darken rah Let it be known throughout the three territories, That whoever brings me the seeker, will be rewarded beyond imagining. -Any sign of them? -Only a burned out campfire. Did you follow the tracks leading away from it? They were too well covered. So you found nothing then. Just this, caught on some underbrush. So much for the bounty.

 It's his. Legend of the Seeker S01E03 Bounty There he is. You think you can steal food from lord rahl's army? I didn't steal anything. Liar. My men found the food in your barn. He was starving. Where is the rest of your band of thieves? I am the only one, there's no one else. How can I help you today, sir? I need a map. A map. I've got many maps. How about a map to the ruins of calabra, the twin barrier peaks, -false of the white plume, very popular. -I need a map to track someone. A map to track someone. Not sure a map like that actually exists. Of course, if it did, it would be very costly. I need something that belonged to the person you want it to track. Who did you say that pendant belonged to again? He's getting away. Whose fault is that? Then stay away from my... I waited, he didn't. Did I get it? So what's for dinner? Wizard of the first starter, really. I was hungry, it was getting away. You torched only game seen in two days. Here used to be plentiful in these parts. The D'Harans are over-hunting to feed the armies. Too bad it could get away from us yesterday. Don't remind me, Zedd. I lost my father's pendant chasing. Sorry, Richard, I know it meant a lot to you. Wait. Kahlen, no. Hold still. I'll find the ropes. And end up like that rabbit? Hurry, Zedd. Do it now. Don't move. The sword. I didn't agree to fight a wizard. Coward! I almost had him. Well, at least you got his money. He will be paying for dinner. What's that? A map. It is moving. Appears to have stopped. What's that light? I think it's you. A map that knows where I am? Cartographer is... Rare and powerful magic. Few know of its existence, much less its practice. Could Darken rahl made it? If rahl were tracking you, he wouldn't have sent the entire D'Hara army. You would be dead already. That's comforting. Luckily the map in our hands now. Well, you know it could be useful. If we got split up, you would know how to find me. Like those highway men did.Why would they know such a thing? Where did they get that? They weren't highway men. They were bounty hunters. A thousand gold pieces for the seeker. If rahl is offering that kind of money, bounty hunters Won't be the only ones looking for you I'm telling you, it is him You're right. Let's go. It's him. The seeker is mine. We don't want any trouble. Trouble it is. Run! Now! Thank you for your help. Good to know that everyone in the town is against us. Are you really the seeker? Yes. Then I need your help. My little brother and I were attacked by a chadrin. It took him. A chadrin? One of the most feared creatures in the midlands. Few who have seen it have lived to describe it. It happened so fast. All I saw were claws and teeth. I thought the chadrin was a myth. Did the myth do this to me? I couldn't fight it off, I wasn't strong enough. And none of these cowards in the tavern would help me. The Chadrin hunt during the day, it keep their prey alive until night fall, Then they feed. Then there's still time. Please, you have to help him. He is just a boy. Where did the thing attack you? I can take you there. What about the people trying to collect the bounty on your head? You mean the ones trying to capture me when she stepped in? We can take care of ourselves. Lily's brother can't. Oh, here, you got my message. What makes you think I'll be so interested in one of your maps? Because this one will lead you to the seeker. You can be the one to claim the bounty. It will cost you. Great. I can buy a new quil. There you go. Careful, that's one of a kind. This is where it attacked us. Liam had skinned his knee. He was crying when I just came and took him. The Chadrin are nearly blind, they hunt by sound. Must have been drawn by your brother's cries. See if we can pick up its trail, then follow it back to the nest. The stories I heard, the chadrin build nests in caves. There are some caves up ahead. We don't have much time before sundown. Your right, we'd better hurry. My car threw a wheel, I could use some help getting it back on. I'm sorry, we have to help a boy in danger. We will come back if we can. Zedd, Get out of here. Richard! Another one. Where did you get this? You'd better answer the confessor. Serbastian The map maker in south Caston. If he's selling these maps, It's only a matter of time before we are ambushed By more of his customers. You can't risk helping me. You need to keep moving. The seeker is too important. No, we are going to find your brother. You go after Lily's brother and I will find this map maker. This will take me to the seeker. Yes. It is a one of a kind item, and as my best customer, I wanted to give you first chance at it. Happy hunting. Back so soon? I need another map. I can't. Why not? I'm out of ink, But if you have something else that belonged to the seeker, We can make it work. You had plenty of ink when I left here. You made more maps, didn't you? =Who did you sell them to? -I...I... I just sold the last one to the man that just left. He's markings on his face. If you leave now, you can catch him. Richard, look at this. We are not far from the next border. If we move beyond it, Anyone that has one of these won't be able to track you. We can double back to the north and cross the river. What about Lily's brother, the chadrin is in the other direction. You have a bigger destiny than helping one boy. Especially when he might already be dead. It is only a matter of time How are we to hunt darken rahl if we are being hunted ourselves. And running away is going to help? You will be alive. By sacrificing lily's brother. We've all made sacrifices. I lost my sister trying to find you and I don't regret that decision. I've sworn to protect you with my life, even from yourself. Richard, the cave is just a step ahead. Is something wrong? No, we're coming. Lily! Lily! We are closed. Not yet you're not. I hear you're selling maps to track the seeker. I don't know what you're talking about, But maybe I can interest you in a map of the ruins of calabra. Don't really know where you got that, Old man. You're going to tell me how you made this, How many you made, and who you sold them to. Um it's a bounty hunter He had a pendent, and said it belonged to the seeker. He said to make the map. How many did you make? One. Three.Three. I just sold the last one. Did you sell any to the D'Harans? Of course not. They don't buy maps. They take them. I loathe the D'Harans. And you would help them By aiding those that are capture the seeker for darken rahl. Where was the seeker when we were suffering under lord rahl? Did you know that I used to be in the service of kings And then the D'Harans moved in. I got to provide for my family. To do that, I make maps. Now you make one for me. I need to find the bounty hunter who bought the last map. Can't do it. Got to have something that belonged to him, something he valued greatly. He paid you, didn't he? What could be more valuable to a bounty hunter than his money. Lily? Lily! Lily! Kahlen! Kahlen? I left her back in the cave. You trapped her with that beast? Please, everyone knows a chadrin is in myth. This ought to lead you to the bounty hunter. If you leave now, you can catch him. I'll be leaving. But if you make any more maps to track the seeker, I'll be back. Richard! Why are you doing this? I was trying to help you. That's right. Because you're the seeker? I don't believe that fairy tale, But if the D'Harans do and they are willing to pay, All the better for me. Hoestyly, I don't see what they are so afraid of. They are afraid of the prophesy. Right.You are going to defeat darken rahl and save everyone in midlands. Right now, you are the only thing to stop me. And look how hard that was. The D'Harans don't need to send an army. All it takes is a few tears and an ample bosom. Hand over the map, and I'll let you live. How about this. You walk away, and I won't kill you. You can keep your half. Damn! You didn't think the seeker was going to stay in one place, did you? This is your lucky day. Do you see him? That's the seeker, You get to be the hero, go back to your captain and tell him I have him. If you want the seeker, meet me at demon rock, But tell him, I don't want the bounty, I want something else. Tell me, what's worth more to you than the bounty on the seeker? My brother. So I guess the chadrin didn't take him. No, worse. He was arrested by the D'Harans. They were going to execute him for stealing. Did he do it? No, I did. He confessed to protect me. So you're a thief? What choice do I have. The only food around here is what you can steal from D'Harans, It is steal or starve of and I am not going to starve. My brother is all I have left. I won't let daharans them kill him. Don't you see, I'm on your side. If you had told me the truth, I would have helped your brother. Maybe when you thought he was an innocent boy. With everyone trying to collect a bounty on you, If I asked you to ride into a D'Haran garrison to help a thief, Would you have said yes? Thought you might want some food. I know you're hungry. Sorry I hit you before. I just had to put on a good show in front of my men. It is okay, take it. No, no, no. Thank you. Fool. We hang thieves. We don't feed them up. Look, unshackle me, We can go back to Kahlan, And then we can all rescue your brother. Right. What guarantee do I have you won't take off as soon as I unshackle you? I give you my word as the seeker. That would mean something if I believed you were the seeker. The seeker is mine. Don't be a fool. There's no guarantee he is going to stay on one half of the map. What are you suggesting? We work together. We already split the map, let's split the bounty. Two against one. It's better odds. You agreed to that a little too quickly. How do I know you're not trying to trick me. You suggested too quickly. How do I know you're not trying to trick me. All right. Longer we argue, more time the seeker has to escape. We just gonna have to trust each other. Kahlan! Richard! Are you hurt? I am fine, how about you? Next time, when I tell you we can't help someone, Don't trust them, trust me. She was very convincing. Yes, she was. Kahlen, I'm so sorry I got you into all of this. Apology accepted. Move! On the ground, confessor. Do you think you'll get something for her, too? Once we collect on the seeker, there'll be plenty for both of us. Until he double crosses you. Who are you? Someone who knows this man a lot better than you do. I've never seen this woman before. We can share the bounty, And whatever else you might be interested in. Don't listen to her. What kind of deal are we talking about? I knew you would stab me in the back! I won't be so gentle. Where do you think you're going? Well, let's takes care of all three maps. Even so there's still a bounty on your head. We should get going. What are we gonna do about her? You may as well kill me. If I don't deliver the seeker to the D'Harans, My brother is as good as dead. What are you doing? Keeping my promise, I'm going to save her brother. Have you learned nothing? She tried to feed me to a chadrin. She thought it was a myth. She tried to sell you to the D'Harans. She is trying to save her brother. And you believe her. Everything out of her mouth has been a lie. Zed, tell me you don't trust this woman. No. But I do trust richard. And people must know that the seeker will stand and fight for them. What has she done to deserve our help. How do we decide who deserves our help. She'll be enough if she needs it. Don't be naive. This isn't Westland. Exactly. Darken Rahl has forced people from the Midlands To do anything to just survive. Including serving you up to the D'Harans. Richard, people like her are only looking out for themselves. And if the seeker just stand up for himself, what chance do they have. Sir, I know where the seeker is. Why haven't you brought him to me. He has been captured. By whom? A woman has him. A woman? Yes, sir. She doesn't want the bounty. What does she want? Two patrols along the perimeter, four sentries at the main gate. A few dozens of D'Harans inside. I think this can work. It's a smart plan, richard. It all depends on trusting lily. If she is lying to us, you will be captured and killed. And darken rahl will win. What is it you want? You are holding a prisoner named liam. You release him, you can have the seeker Where is the seeker? This map will take you there. If you hurry, you can get the confessor and the wizard as well. But if you want it, I want to see my brother. Very well. Take her to her brother. We had an agreement! We had an agreement! You bastards! Lily? Liam! What have they done to you? I'm all right. What are you doing here? Trying to get you out. All I wanted is you to be safe. I couldn't standby and let them execute you. Now what? We both die? Not today. I want every available man ready. We are going after the seeker. Seeker is up ahead, this way. Come on. Let's go Come on, men. The seeker isn't here. That's not the seeker. We've been tricked. Guess it is hard that they believed you gave them the right map. It wasn't that hard convincing them. I am a devious, conniving woman. I want to thank you for saving my brother. I mean, despite the fact that I lied to you. And tried to sell me to the D'Harans and kill my friends. And those are just the things you know about. You did all this just to help us. He is the seeker. Richard, we should get moving. If you ever come back this way, maybe we will see each other again. You better hope not. They have no intention of paying the bounty on the seeker. Anyone tries to collect will find himself inside a D'Haran prison cell. Besides, The seeker is on our side, he is fighting for us. The least we can do is help him out. How did you do that? It's called lenitive magic. Try to hold on to it this time. It is the only thing I have of my father's. I'm not letting it out of my sight again. Kahlan, I just want you to know that I really appreciate you looking out for me. Well, if you had listened to me, that boy would have been executed. You saved him. After living under rahl for so long, people have forgotten what a hero is. But you stood up and fought for them. Word will spread. The people will know that the seeker has returned. We should get going soon. Oh, come on, what's the hurry. If you're going to need to rescue every damn little distress, There's no time to waste. YOU HAVE MY CELL. CALL ME ANY TIME. ESPECIALLY WHEN ELLEN REGAS CONSCIOUSNESS. WHAT'S THE UPDATE? ALL THE DOCTORS SAY IS THEY'RE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. AND WHEN ASKING WHAT THAT MEANS ABOUT HER WAKING UP, THEY HAVE NO ANSWERS. HE ACTUALLY THINKS AJ SUN CARES. IT'S DISGUSTING. GUY THINKS WE'RE ALL HERE FOR--FOR ELLEN, WHO HE THINK I HELPED SAVE FROM A CARJACKING IN TORRANCE, WHO WAS REALLY SHOT IN BEIJING AFTER I WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIREFIGHT AND FREAKED OUT. SHE GOT SHOT TRYING TO SAVE ME. AND BECAUSE I THINK SHE MIGHT'VE HEARD ME CALL FOR HELP AS HENRY AS APPOSED TO EDWARD, PART OF ME HOPES THAT SHE NEVER WAKES UP. HOW SICK IS THAT? IT'S NOT SICK. IT'S COMPLICATED. IS THAT HOW YOU RATIONALIZE WHAT YOU DO? DISSOLVING PROCTOR IN A VAT OF SULFURIC ACID WASN'T SICK, IT WAS COMPLICATED? HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH YOURSELF? IT'S HARD. AND ONE DAY I'M SURE I'LL HAVE A LOT TO ANSWER FOR. BUT I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO DIE. OH PLEASE. YOU DIDN'T WANT EDWARD TO DIE. I MEAN, WHAT--WHAT IS IT ABOUT EDWARD THAT EVERYBODY LOVES SO MUCH? AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, ALL HE UNDERSTANDS IS SELF-PRESERVATION AND SEX. SERIOUSLY, THE GUY-- HE'S A WALKING HORMONE! I WOKE UP THIS MORNING WITH SOME FLOOZY IN A HOTEL ROOM IN THE SHOWER. I'M A MARRIED MAN WITH A BEAUTIFUL WIFE. THIS ISN'T RIGHT. I'M LYING THROUGH MY TEETH. AND GOD FORBID HE FINDS OUT ANYTHING ABOUT PAULA. THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT HE WILL DO TO HER. YOU HAVE ANY IDEA IF HE KNOWS? I DON'T. I'M SORRY. HE'S LIKE THIS PLAGUE THAT TAKES OVER EVERYTHING. HE'S TAKEN OVER MY SEX LIFE AND NOW I'M WORRIED HE'S TAKEN OVER JACK, WHO'S SKIPPED OUT ON GUITAR LESSONS TO DO GOD KNOWS WHAT. I'M SURE YOU AND ANGIE NURTURED A DECENT YOUNG MAN. BUT JACK'S A TEENAGER AND THIS IS WHEN NATURE TAKES OVER. WHOSE NATURE? MINE OR EDWARD'S? DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT JACK'S BEEN DOING INSTEAD OF GOING TO HIS LESSONS? OHO, SOME LOVELY PEOPLE. WHAT'S THAT FOR? WELL, I-I THOUGHT WE MIGHT BE GOING TO A CONCERT OR SOMETHING. SO IF IT'S IMPORTANT TO JACK, IT'S IMPORTANT TO US. WE MIGHT WANT TO RECORD IT. OH WOW, IT MUST BE, LIKE, TAE KWON DO OR SOMETHING. YEAH. LEAST HE'S GETTING SOME EXERCISE. WELL, THIS IS GOOD, RIGHT? GOOD SPOT. WHY WOULDN'T HE WANT US TO KNOW ABOUT THIS? OH MY GOD. OH GOD. AH. OH, HEY! OH MAN! GOOD MOVE. THAT WAS AMAZING. OH. OH. JACK! ALL RIGHT! HENRY, YOU CAN'T WALK OUT LIKE THIS. IN MOST STATES, THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A FELONY. I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS IN THERE. THAT WAS OUR TEENAGE SON, WHO'S NOT DRINKING OR DOING DRUGS. HE'S A GOOD KID WHO OBVIOUSLY FOUND A SPORT THAT HE ENJOYS. THAT IS NOT MY SON. THEN WHO'S SON IS HE? DID YOU KNOW HE HAD A SECRET LIFE? NO. ARLENE COVERED FOR HIM. HENRY PROBABLY DID TOO. YOU WORK FOR THE SAME COMPANY. WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU? MARY, SHE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING. AND I SHOULD TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT?

TOM, YOU NEED TO TELL MARY WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO IN THE SHORT TERM IN ORDER TO WIN BACK HER TRUST. WELL, UH... I'LL NEVER GO ON A BUSINESS TRIP WHERE MY PHONE HAS TO BE OFF. AND IF I GET HELD UP, I'LL CALL MYSELF INSTEAD OF ARLENE. AND IF YOU CAN COME WITH ME SOMETIMES, THAT WOULD BE GOOD. MARY. WHAT? TOM HAS TO WIN BACK YOUR TRUST, BUT YOU HAVE TO WIN BACK HIS TOO. WHAT'D I DO? HE HAD THE AFFAIR. YOU HIRED A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR. BECAUSE HE WAS LYING. AND NOW THAT THE TRUTH IS KNOWN, IT'S TIME TO HEAL. AND THAT CAN'T HAPPEN IF TOM FEELS HE'S STILL BEING WATCHED. WELL, I DON'T-- I DON'T TRUST HIM. BUT YOU'RE HERE. AND SOMETHING TELLS ME THE FACT YOU CAME IN TODAY MEANS YOU WANT TO TRY AND MAKE THIS WORK. YOU WANT TOM TO ACT TRUSTWORTHY BECAUSE HE IS TRUSTWORTHY, NOT BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID OF GETTING CAUGHT. AND THAT'S CAN'T HAPPEN UNLESS YOU PROMISE NOT TO USE A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR. CAN YOU DO THAT? I TOOK CARE OF IT. MARY GRADY PROMISED TO DROP THE P.I. I CAN'T PUT RAYMOND BACK ON THE JOB BASED ON A PROMISE. NATURALLY. WHICH IS WHY I TAPPED HER PHONE. SHE LEFT MY OFFICE AND CALLED THE P.I. FROM THE CAR. HERE'S A TRANSCRIPT OF THE CALL. IT'S DONE.

I REMEMBER EDWARD CALLING FOR HELP. HE IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS HENRY SPIVEY. YOU SURE ABOUT THAT? POSITIVE. BECAUSE I NEVER HEARD HIM USE THAT NAME BEFORE. IT'S HIS CIVILIAN NAME. WHY WOULD EDWARD USE HIS CIVILIAN NAME? HE WOULDN'T. BUT HENRY WOULD. WHICH PROVES THEY'RE BROKEN. EDWARD'S INBOUND. I WANT NO FURTHER COMMUNICATION UNTIL HE'S IN THE NEST. PAULA CONFIRMED HENRY BROKE COVER IN BEIJING. I PUT TERMINATION PROTOCOLS INTO EFFECT. BASED ON THE MEMORY OF AN OPERATIVE WHO JUST CAME OUT OF A COMA? PAULA KNEW EDWARD'S CIVILIAN NAME. SHE COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT UNLESS HE WAS BROKEN. I'LL GET STARTED COLLECTING EDWARD'S MISSION FILES. DR. KRAVITZ, YOU HAVE A VISITOR IN THE MAIN LOBBY. DR. KRAVITZ...

EDWARD SAVED MY LIFE AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO WIPE HIM CLEAN. I NEVER SHOULD HAVE SAID ANYTHING. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. I'M GOING TO UPLOAD THE MEMORIES BEFORE YOUR FAMILY RETURNS. YOU ARE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE. I ONLY WISH THAT WERE TRUE. WHEN AN OPERATIVE IS TERMINATED, HIS EXPERIENCES, MEMORIES, HIS CONSCIOUS BEING IS WIPED. IT'S NOT DEATH. IT'S JUST THE END OF THIS LIFE. SEEMS LIKE AN OPPORTUNE MOMENT TO REMIND YOU I DID NOT WANT THIS LIFE. YOU WANTED IT FOR ME. IT'S A SMALL CONSOLATION, I KNOW. BUT THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT. AND NO ONE THINKS THAT YOU BETRAYED YOUR COUNTRY. PAULA. THAT IS NOT MY NAME. ELLEN. STAND DOWN. YOU PEOPLE ARE TWISTED. THE THINGS YOU DID TO ME. WHAT YOU MADE ME DO. WHAT WOULD THAT BE, ELLEN? I WOKE UP WITH THESE NIGHTMARES ABOUT MISSIONS I'VE BEEN ON. THOSE ARE DREAMS. FIGMENTS OF YOUR IMAGINATION. NO! THEY ARE REAL! I DON'T KNOW HOW, BUT THEY ARE. HENRY. HOW CAN YOU DO THIS? HOW CAN YOU LET THEM DO THIS TO YOU? NO, THEY DIDN'T DO IT TO US. WE DID IT TO OURSELVES. DON'T COME ANY CLOSER. LISTEN TO ME. PAULA VOLUNTEERED. SHE WANTED THIS LIFE. I'M WARNING YOU. TH--T--IN ORDER TO GET IT, THERE WAS A MICROCHIP IMPLANTED IN YOUR BRAIN. THAT CHIP IS BROKEN AND WE CAN HELP YOU FIX IT. YOU'LL FORGET ALL OF THIS EVER HAPPENED. STAY AWAY. NO. HENRY. MY NAME IS EDWARD. IT APPEARS PAULA ACCUSED YOU TO DEFLECT THE FACT THAT SHE WAS THE BROKEN OPERATIVE. EARLIER TODAY, DR. SKINNER REPORTED PROCTOR HAD ALREADY BEGUN INVESTIGATING OTHER OPERATIVES. PAULA WAS ONE OF THEM. I'M SORRY THAT I DOUBTED YOU. NO APOLOGY NECESSARY. YOU WERE RIGHT. ONE OF US WAS BROKEN. THIS IS REALLY NECESSARY? YEAH. FOR AN OPERATIVE TO BE ERASED, THEY NEED TO BE AWAKE. PLEASE, I'M BEGGING YOU. PLEASE DON'T DO THIS. NO OPERATIVE HAS EVER BROKEN. NOW TWO BREAK IN A MONTH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO EDWARD, BUT ELLEN WAS SHOWN PAULA'S MEMORIES ON PURPOSE SO SHE'D APPEAR BROKEN. PLEASE. PLEASE, SPARE ME. DID YOU SWITCH HER TO PAULA AFTER SHE WOKE UP? NO, NORAH DID. FIRST SHE ADMINISTERS THE MIND PROBE THAT EDWARD MIRACULOUSLY PASSES AND NOW SHE SACRIFICES ELLEN TO SAVE HIM FROM BEING TERMINATED. I THINK EDWARD HAS A GUARDIAN ANGEL. IT'S DONE. PAULA NO LONGER EXISTS. SHE'S NO LONGER A SPLIT. SHE'S JUST ELLEN. OH MY GOSH, I'M GONNA MISS YOU SO MUCH. FIRST OF ALL, ABOUT OUR KID, I SAW THE VIDEO YOUR WIFE TOOK THE OTHER NIGHT. JACK IS A KILLER. WE HAD WHAT I SUPPOSE A REAL FATHER AND SON MOMENT WATCHING HIM IN ACTION. I'M SORRY YOU MISSED IT. AS FOR PAULA, TO PROTECT US, SHE HAS BEEN WIPED CLEAN. THAT'S WHAT TERMINATION MEANS. THE END OF THE OPERATIVE WHILE THE CIVILIAN LIVES ON. YES! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED WITHOUT YOU. COME. COME, COME, COME. JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW, I HAVE INJECTED US WITH A LITTLE NANOVIRUS. IT'S COMPLETELY HARMLESS FOR THE MOMENT. HOWEVER, IF JANUS EVER TRIES TO TERMINATE ME, THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD THEY USE WILL ACTIVATE THE VIRUS AND YOU WILL DIE. DON'T GET ANY BRIGHT IDEAS. WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER. I GET IT, OKAY? I HURT YOU, YOU HURT ME BACK. I'M NOT FREE. BUT UNLIKE YOU, I CAN SEE PAST THAT TO ELLEN'S FREEDOM. I CAN ENJOY THAT. THEY SAY IF YOU SAVE ONE LIFE, YOU SAVE THE WORLD. I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THAT, BUT NOW I DO. ELLEN HAS BEEN SAVED FROM US-- FROM WHAT WE DO. AND IN THE WORLD YOU HAVE CREATED FOR ME, THAT SMALL FACT FEELS LIKE SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE.
