 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES EPISODE 4 No. This isn't what I want. We're adults now. As long as we're responsible, we can do whatever we want. If I didn't want to, I wouldn't give you a chance. Hey, do you want some grilled squid? Wake up, Meizuo.

 Get up, Meizuo. What are you doing? Have some squid. You're a pervert! -Grilled squid time! -Hey! -What's your problem? -Who wants some squid? -It's so good. -I... Ximen! What are you doing? Hey! Ximen! Ximen! What is wrong with you? I was about to sleep. -Grilled squid at this hour? -Hey! -Yes, grilled squid. -I told you,

 -I was about to sleep. -Wake up! -Get up! -So annoying. Get up! Hey, get up! Hey, Jing. Want some grilled squid? Get up. Wake up! I want this. This one? Thanks. You're welcome. Thank you. You're so cute. Shancai, do you want some grilled squid? No, thanks. I'll just have a drink. Okay. Thanks. Here you go. Okay, thanks. Hurry up. All right. -Thanks. -Here. -Cheers. -Cheers. Hey. Look. Do you know what this is? -This... -It's just a bucket. I mean, what's inside it? Is it squid? No. It's the squid that I caught. Si. Have you been fishing for squid all night? Yes. It's so much fun. Let's never hang out with him again, okay? Shancai. What are you drinking? This. Did you see everything? Yes. I'm sorry. I just wanted to return the dress. I didn't mean to. You... You must hate me. I know I'm a lot of trouble. I'm hard to please and I'm kind of selfish. But to me, you're a very, very important friend. If I hate you, why would I save you so many times? Tell me. When are you going to talk to him? Well, according to Si's logic, they're not talking because he forbade Lei from talking to him. But Si can still talk to Lei. Cut it out. I'll talk to him when I want to. All of us pursue different kinds of happiness in this world. To me, a smile from Lei is enough. Si, you're early today. I want to get there early. I'm happy that you're so energetic. I'm happy for you. The color of that tie doesn't really go with your outfit. It's not something you would wear. It's fine. I want to try something new today. Oh? All right. Your breakfast is here. -Okay. -I'll go now. Hey, Shancai. Shancai. Shancai. Good morning, Qinghe. Thank you for the trip. Don't mention it. I still can't forget how exciting the last night in Sanya was. That night in Sanya? My aunts and uncles heard that I won F4 over with squid-fishing. They're so proud. Is that what you're talking about? Yes. Didn't you see the squid I grilled? All of them started drooling. They loved it. I've managed to make F4 like me with my food! Good morning! Shancai, see? They think of me as their friend now. They never looked at me before. Now, they hit my head. That's something friends do. Please turn in your assignment from last week. Pass it to your right to the class leader. Shancai is getting out of hand. First, she winked at Daoming Si in front of you. Next, she tackled him and kissed him. This Shancai... I can't tell her who to like or hit on. But she's getting close to Huaze Lei and seducing Daoming Si at the same time. What is she doing? Yes. She just wants to be popular. If we knew they were going to Sanya, we should've gone too. Zhen. Aren't you friends with Shancai? Why didn't she bring you along? Hello, sir. -Hello, sir. -Hello. That Shancai is so ridiculous. This video has gone viral on Now Live. She tackled and kissed Daoming Si in public. Yeah, what was she thinking? Unbelievable. Where are my sneakers? Good morning, Shancai. Daoming Si, why are you wearing my shoes? Are these your shoes? No wonder they're kind of tight. Daoming Si, is there something wrong with you? You're so immature for your age. I feel sorry for you. Hey. I... Hey. Hey. Did you see her face? She was so mad. You woke us up so early today just to see that? Yes. I didn't sleep last night so I can do this to pick on her. We should really think about why we're friends with someone so immature. Don't worry. This is just the first part of my plan. You have a plan? Yes. My plan is to seduce her first, mess around with her and then dump her. She'll be so sad. Nobody up there or down there will be able to help her. I feel like you'll fall for her first. Are you kidding? Would I like someone that lame? Hey, where are you going? Hey. Hey. Can you get me my shoes? You're drawing Jing, aren't you? You can tell? Does it look like her? Yeah. Are you sure? I've never been good at art. Jing is probably the only person you'd draw. I guess so. You have chalk dust on your head. Where? There. Where? Can I... Sure. That's good. Thanks. This is enough. For me, the time I spent with Lei on the rooftop was probably the only time I felt calm and relaxed at this school. Look at him. How many times has he watched it? I don't know. But I do know that when you like someone, you have to follow her QQ space. I think this time, Si has really fallen for her. Daoming Si. Do you remember me? I'm Xinhui, a freshman in the Nutrition Department. I really like you. And? My classmate, Shancai, has been rude to you. I have a video of her to show you. Hopefully, she'll stay out of trouble. Let me see. No, it's for Daoming Si. Give it to me. What's the big deal? Yeah. Shancai only touched Huaze Lei head. They've been meeting on the rooftop for a few times now. Even though Huaze Lei likes Jing, Shancai seems to be interested in him. Shut up. She kissed you once, but now she's flirting with Huaze Lei. I told you to shut up, didn't I? Si, Xinhui s just trying to remind you that Shancai isn't as innocent as she looks. You should be careful. Get out of the way. -Shancai. -Yes? What are you wearing to Jing's birthday party? I don't know. My mom said she would help me. What about you? I've already prepared a cool outfit. I'll be the star of the show. Zhen, Jing is having a party this weekend. Do you want to come? But she didn't invite me. It's okay. She said I could bring my friends. Qinghe and Xiaoyou will be there. We're all high-school classmates. Let's go together. Yeah, maybe we'll see someone famous there. All right. Where's my notebook? I left it on the rooftop. I'm going to get it. GIVE BACK TO YOUR PARENTS FOR THEIR HARD WORK MY DAD ALWAYS TELLS ME TO FOCUS ON MY STUDIES WHILE HE WORKS MULTIPLE JOBS CREDIT CARD HOLDER, LI ZHEN This way, I can buy a dress to wear to Jing's birthday party. Daoming Si, what are you doing here? Why are you here? They were telling the truth. Don't go. What are you doing? Shancai, you tricked me. What are you talking about? Who tricked you? Hey! You're a bad girl. Why are you so mean? What the hell are you talking about? Let go! I'm going to get angry. I'm the one who should get angry. How did I piss you off now? Tell me. Stop pretending. You know what you're doing. Don't come near me. It's all your fault! Daoming Si. I'm begging you. Please stop. Stop crying. I won't hurt you anymore. Shancai's home. Go wash your hands and get ready to eat. I'm not hungry. You're not hungry? Are you on a diet? No. Let me see. Why is there blood here? What happened? Tell me. Is someone bullying you? I'll go beat him up. I tripped and fell. It doesn't look like it. Did someone hurt you? No. Stop lying. That's enough. She's always had a grumpy face. You should know that. -I guess so. -All right. That's enough. I'm really tired. I want to go rest now. Come out and eat later. Lei. I think Jing came back this time for you. Really? When are you going to tell her how you feel? I'm thinking about it. Si, what happened to your hand? Did you hit Shancai? Did you hit a wall? I'm going to class now. He probably hit both of them. Lei. What's going on with you and Shancai? What? What? Why would Daoming Si do that to you? Didn't you say that you had grilled squid together in Sanya? I'm confused. He stole my sneakers and was being all stupid about it. The next second, he turns into a pervert. Every time I close my eyes, I can see his crazy eyes. Then what happened? There's nothing else. I've been going to school really early and coming straight home so that I won't bump into him. What about Jing's birthday party? Will you see him there? I'm worried about that too. It's fine. There'll be a lot of people. Just pretend you don't see him. That's all I can do. Shancai, you're wearing makeup now? Wetcode Aqua Cushion CC Cream? Last time in Sanya, Jing recommended it. It's not bad. It's very popular lately. Let me see. Your skin looks flawless. So moisturized. Can I borrow it later? Sure. No problem. By the way, Shancai, will that handsome guy, Ximen, be there? Xiaoyou. Wow. Qinghe. What an awesome car. -What do you think? Cool, right? -Yes. My dad said for an occasion like this, I have to drive Qinghe number two. -What about Qinghe number one? -That's me. Silly girl. Shancai. -Wow. -Hey. What do you think? Do I look weird? No. You look great. Wow, so pretty. WOMEN'S DRESS, 5,998 YUAN You can pay in installments with a credit card. With 12 installments, it's only a few hundred yuan a month. How are you paying? Can I use my Bank of Communications app? Of course. BANK OF COMMUNICATIONS APP Everyone looks wonderful. They're dressed so formally. Do you think we're dressed up enough? Why not? At least, I look good. Isn't that the actress, Zhou Dongyu? So pretty. Calm down, Xiaoyou. My dad said at events like this, if you see someone famous, you should pretend you didn't see them. We should get something to eat first. Come on. There's so much food. -Which one do you want? -This one. It's Ximen. He's so handsome. Which one is Si? -Si. -Si... Do you see that pineapple head? That's Daoming Si. One time, we went squid-fishing and I caught way more than him. His squid was smaller than... Than what? My finger. Shancai. You look very elegant today. Yes, very cute. Daoming Si, you're still so handsome. I just came back from London last month. I went to Fashion Week there. I saw your sister. She's still so beautiful. I bought this dress I'm wearing over there. What do you think? Shancai. What are you doing? Isn't it nice? What are you up to lately? You should come out with us. You never hang out with us anymore. Next time when you're free, don't forget to call me. Lei, don't be sad. I'll be back. Welcome. This way, please. Please show your invitation. My friend has it. She's inside. -Can you let me in? -I'm sorry. You need an invitation to get in. Excuse me, please step aside. Ms. Li, you look wonderful. Let me see that. Welcome. Sir, hello. Invitation, please. Mr. Wang, hello. Ms. Wang, you look beautiful tonight. It has been a while. Please come in. This way, please. I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose. What have you done? This is an expensive suit. What are you going to do now? It was an accident. Don't worry. It's fine. How about you wipe it clean for me? Is that okay? I'll wipe it for you. But your suit is flimsy. The texture is terrible. You should just toss it. What a rude boy. It's none of your business. Has my phone died again? Where's Xiaoyou? -The number you dialed is... -Okay, thanks. Please try again later. I go to Mingde University, the same school Jing goes to. My friend is inside. Can you let me in? Miss, please don't cause any trouble. Show your invitation or ask your friend to come get you, okay? -But I-- -Don't get in the way. Sir, invitation, please. Welcome. Ms. Li, you look fabulous. This way, please. Ms. Zhao, hello. Invitation, please. Welcome. Ms. Li, it has been a while. Are you okay, Ms. Milk Tea? Thank you. You remember me? You're cute. Of course I remember you. Are you free later? -What? -I'm a tea expert. -Maybe later we can-- -What do you want? We're in public. What can I do? Don't talk to him. If you talk to him, you'll get pregnant. Hey. I'm very careful, okay? Ignore him. But I think he's handsome. His voice is mesmerizing. He seems more composed than Daoming Si. Xiaoyou, get yourself together. Where's your phone? I need to call Zhen. My phone is dead again. Here. -Hello? -Zhen, where are you? -I'm sorry, my phone died-- -I called you to say that something came up. I can't go. What? You can't come? Yes. Have fun. Hey, I have something to tell you. What is it? Nothing. -Shancai. -What's up with him? Who knows? Daoming Si just taught me how to make girls like me. How? I'll tell you later. She's so beautiful. Subtitle translation by Sophie Chang
