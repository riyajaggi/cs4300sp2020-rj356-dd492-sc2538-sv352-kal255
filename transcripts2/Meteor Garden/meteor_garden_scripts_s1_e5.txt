 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES EPISODE 5 It looks like Lei is going to confess to Jing. Aren't they already together? I thought when they were in Sanya, they had... Had what? Nothing. What kind of relationship do they have now, then? Jing is someone very important to Lei. Lei actually suffered from a mild case of autism. His mom was particularly strict too.

 His autism got worse because of that. We didn't know how to help him. Thankfully, Jing appeared. No matter how indifferent Lei was, how much he avoided her, Jing wouldn't stop looking for him. The reason Lei is who he is today... LET'S GO PLAY, OKAY? Is because of Jing. I have something to tell you. I-- I know. Thanks, everyone, for coming to the party tonight. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the birthday girl, Teng Tangjing,

 to make her birthday wish. Thank you for taking the time to come to my birthday party. Today, I'm turning 24. After my graduation, it's time to make some real life decisions. There's something I'd like to announce here. I've decided to give up my position as the heir of Tengtang Investment Group to join Lawyers Without Borders. -What? -Is she really going to? I want to help the poor. Jing, what are you blabbering about? Dad, Mom. I'm sorry. Please forgive my stubbornness. Pretend you married off your daughter. I'll be going back to Paris in a few days. I've no immediate plans to come back. All this while, thanks to my family, I've led a blessed and comfortable life. But I know, living a comfortable life without a real purpose is not what I want. From now on, I no longer need these beautiful clothes needing delicate care. I want to be myself. Lei! Hey. You shouldn't go. Lei. I'm sorry. I know what you had wanted to tell me. I cannot say yes. You only need to say a few words in support of the partnership between your mother and my company. I'd be deeply grateful. I'm sorry. I never paid much attention to my mom's business. I can't add much. All you need to do is put in a few good words. I'll be happy to oblige any requests you have. If you insist that I say something, I guess you'll need to wait until I take over. Not to mention, only if your company could survive until then. If you won't help, fine. Damn you. Hey! Why were you eavesdropping? Why would I eavesdrop on you? Stop getting ahead of yourself. Who would want to listen to all your bullshit? As if you're so incredible. "As if"? I am incredible. Do you know how many people want to see my mom, but they can't? Anyone that can't see her come to me instead. It's a winner-take-all world. You won't understand. This is exactly your problem. You think you're all that. That's how you managed to get the model just now. What a professional! Hey, those girls are only after me because of the Daoming name. I would never be with a girl like that. Why are you yelling at me? You've brought me nothing but trouble. Also, you haven't apologized for what happened last time. Why should I apologize? -It was your fault! -What did I do? -You never said anything. -That's why you're an idiot. You don't even know what you did wrong. You're the idiot. Hey. Hey! What are you doing? You shouldn't do this in public. -Listen up. -Isn't that Daoming Si? You fell on me. I didn't do anything. It just looks like I did something to you. Gross. Gross? Hey, are you okay? Hey! Hey! Stop, no! What the hell? Mom. How did I get home last night? Are you seriously asking me? Daoming Si brought you home. What? Daoming Si did? Yes. Daoming Si is truly a nice guy. He's handsome and so thoughtful. Not to mention, a real gentleman. If he were my son-in-law, I'd smile in my sleep. I feel like my head is exploding. Sit down and rest then. Why are you still here? -Zhen is there. -Let's go. Zhen, what happened at home yesterday? Is it settled? It wasn't a big deal. What's wrong? Are you sick? I'm fine. I've taken medication. Oh, Zhen. Do you want to see the photos we took at Jing's birthday party? Here. Xiaoyou and I had so many French pastries last night. And Jing looked amazingly beautiful. Aren't these photos great? They're great. And you know what? Jing actually announced that she's giving up her inheritance. She's going to study law in France. And she cut off her hair to show her determination. -We were all shocked. -Yes. I heard from some seniors who were there. Why are you eating so little today? Money is a little tight at home lately. I'm not feeling well. I should go. Remember to take your medication. Dong Shancai. Dong Shancai. Don't you have anything to say? What do you want? You ruined my suit last night. Not even a sorry from you? You haven't apologized for what happened last time either. If you don't want to apologize, shouldn't you at least thank me? Don't forget that I carried you home. You want me to thank you? Okay. Listen carefully. Thank you. What now? You were so drunk last night. You said so many things. Jing is going back to Paris. Is that why you're happy? Do you think you can be with Lei now? Are you all right? Do I look like I'm not? You must be shocked by Jing's decision too, right? Are you going to let her go? That isn't my decision to make. Jing has always been strong-willed. She chooses her own path. She doesn't like being dictated to. This is just like what she'd do. But if she really left, she'll be in Paris while you're in Shanghai. What if... What if she fell in love with someone else? What then? Go and stop her. You want her to stay, don't you? Maybe she'll listen to you. No. Once Jing makes a decision, nobody can do anything to change her mind. When I heard that Jing is going to France, there was a brief moment when I felt a sudden flash of happiness. I thought maybe with Jing gone, Huaze Lei would forget about her and notice me, who's right here. But right now, all those selfish thoughts are out the window. This is the first time that I've seen Huaze Lei so depressed. Deep down, I don't feel happy either. Thanks for coming to my party. There were too many people. I didn't have the chance to talk to you. Why did you want to see me? Jing. Can you not go to Paris? There are places in Shanghai for international studies too. Did Lei ask you to say this? No. It's all me. I can tell that Huaze Lei really looked forward to you coming back from London. He didn't try to stop you going to Paris because he didn't want to pressure you. Actually, he really wants you to stay with him. He'd be really sad if you left. So... So can you please... not go? For Huaze Lei. Shancai. I'm sorry. I can't do it. Jing. I wouldn't want Lei to be sad too. But... call me stubborn or selfish. I won't change my mind for anyone. Huaze Lei told me the same thing. But I don't get it. Don't you like him? To me, love isn't the most important thing in this world. The most important thing to me is to go after what I dream of. I don't like regrets. I'm going to push through and fight for my own dream. Shancai. Thanks for your concern. I need to go now. What are you doing? What was that about? Who asked you to do it? -I thought I could-- -What? I thought I could persuade her. Who do you think you are? Did you think you were being helpful? Stop interfering! But... you two might not meet again. I don't want to see you sad. It's none of your business. Get lost! Do a headstand when you want to cry. This way, the tears won't fall. Why? Why was Huaze Lei so angry? What did I do wrong? Who do you think you are? Did you think you were being helpful? Huaze Lei is right. What right do I have to interfere with Jing? I just made it harder for him. INTERNATIONAL DEPARTURE You still can't reach Lei? He's been out of reach since yesterday. He knows very well that Jing is leaving. He didn't answer my call. Maybe my phone would work. Should I call him? Huaze Lei won't even come to say goodbye? Si. Isn't Lei with you? He's not here? What's that box? This? It's a present for Jing. It's something special. I won't show it to just anyone. -Let me see. -No. -Come on, let me. -No. Thanks. Thank you! What is wrong with you? -What, Qinghe? -What? -It was pretty funny. -Not at all. If Huaze Lei could be more like this guy, he wouldn't be so miserable. Hey. Why do you look so sad? You're already ugly. Looking sad just makes it worse. Daoming Si. Do you have someone you like? Why the sudden question? This is how it is when you like someone. As long as they're happy, it's okay to stand and watch them from a distance. How stupid must you be to say such a thing? If that's the case, it's as good as nothing. What if you died tomorrow? A lifetime of regret? If you won't say it, do you expect them to drill into your head to see how depressed you are? What a surprise. A childish idiot like him managed to verbalize the problem that's been weighing heavily on my mind and Huaze Lei's. Hey, why are you staring into space, idiot? You're the idiot. Nobody curses themselves to die tomorrow. Jing. I'm leaving. You guys take care. -Take care. -Take care. All the best. I'll miss you. Stay healthy. Shancai, I'm sure you'll find happiness. You too. Tell Lei to take care of himself. Don't worry. I'll beat him up for you. Also, stop bullying Shancai. No one has time for that. For you. Jing, watch out. You know, this box is-- Here. -Passengers on flight -I'll cherish it -AF520 to Paris, -no matter what it is. -please check in at the boarding gate. -Time to go. Goodbye. -Please have your passport ready... -Bye. All the best. Okay. Goodbye! I can't believe Jing just left. And Lei didn't show up. Lei. When did you get here? An hour ago. But we didn't see you. I was behind the pillar. Why were you hiding? Are you satisfied with seeing her go like that? What kind of man are you? People like you who have everything have no idea how to work for something. Jing is brave enough to find her own path. Why can't you man up and go after the person you like? Go after her if you really like her. Follow her wherever she goes. I'm taking the next flight to Paris. -Well... -What's this? If you said it a minute later, I would have punched you. Shancai, you're right. I can't go on like this. This time, I'm going to go for it. Thank you. -Hey. -Bye. It's fine. It was just a peck. -Just a peck. -A peck. -I won't have it. -It was just a peck. -I'm-- -Hey. Hey! It was just a peck. -All right. -Hey! It was nothing. Lei may look timid, but he can be tenacious at times. Shancai is the one that got to him. I didn't expect that. Isn't she infatuated with him? Why did she urge him to go after Jing? Besides, she didn't get into an argument while talking to Si just now. How odd. Maybe that's the power of love. It's a mystery. You had to take Huaze Lei to Jing and let them have a happy life together. I actually tried to preach to Huaze Lei. Shame on me. Dong Shancai. Let's date. What did you say? Are you deaf? It was too noisy. I couldn't hear. What was it? Hey! Are you stupid? I can't say it again. Is this your secret weapon to get girls? "Limited edition aphrodisiac perfume to attract the other sex." This is the funniest joke I've ever seen. Si, you know what? My friend is the one selling the perfume. Should I order one for you? Si, you better stash that away properly. We won't have you ruin F4's reputation if people found out. Go away. Come on, you're wasting your resources. You've got two love experts right here. Why are you reading that nonsense? First, we want to know. Who's the target? Could it be Dong Shancai? No way. Shancai is infatuated with the other guy. Right. No matter who it is, those ads are to trick nerds. But you're Daoming Si. You're not like them. Now, just let us handle the dating thing. Tell me then, what would you guys do? First, you must never be late to a date. You need to arrive at least ten minutes early. So when she sees you, she'll know how important the date is to you. Pick a restaurant with a view and an awesome atmosphere. Present her with a rose. With it, a card that smells like strawberries. On the card is written... More ways to have a wonderful date. Remember, no matter what she says, you need to look passionately into her eyes. Pay attention to what she says. I had hives when I was younger. So every time I ate seafood, I'd get rashes. The subject I disliked the most in high school was Biology because we had to dissect frogs. It was so scary! You must have had hives because you're too cute. The reason you're scared of dissecting frogs must be because you're full of compassion. One thing you must remember. If she asks about what your past girlfriends were like, you must never tell her the whole story. Say... So... What kind of girls do you like? To be honest, before I met you, I didn't know what kind of girls I like. If she mentions things that make her sad or heartbroken and cries, you need to tell her with a sincere gaze... He left me just like that. What did I do wrong? It's okay. He left so I could meet you. By now, you'd have won her heart. Keep your manners until the end. Don't be too touchy at the start. With romantic music playing, gaze at her affectionally while you dance together. That is the perfect ending to a date. A date is when the souls of a man and woman have an intimate conversation. A perfect date is the best compliment you can give to a girl. You're going to become the most memorable man in her life. Hey. What was all that crap? It sounded gross to me. What? You're so pathetic when it comes to romance. Yes, that's how I am. Don't you have anything simpler? All right. I'll tell you something easy. Four words. Play hard to get. Who's Harriet? Did you get a new girlfriend? I know, Dad. Stop nagging. I assure you I'm not being bullied at school. If anyone tries to touch me, I'll slap them and tell them to get lost. NOTIFICATION FROM MINGDE UNIVERSITY BOARD Shancai. Look at this. Daoming Si mentioned us on the school's bulletin board. I'm going to be famous! It's only been a month and I'm already on the bulletin board. What? "To everyone. Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m., F4 will be challenging Chen Qinghe and Dong Shancai to a game of Poker." Yes. I got the Joker card right after I started school. I didn't expect the game to happen so soon. I bet it's because Daoming Si lost to me catching squid in Sanya. So he's eager to even up the score. I'm going to make a post. The title will be, "The Ultimate Challenge with F4." No. Maybe "Duel of Masters" is better. "The Best Challenge in Mingde's History"? Shancai, which one is best? None of them. We're dead meat! Why are we dead meat? We get to choose what we want to bet on, right? Let's think how we'll get back at them when we win. It's not the right time for that. Why not? It'll be too late when we win. If I won, I'd make F4 wear tutu skirts and do the Black Swan dance. Or I'd ask Daoming Si to shave his head. What do you think? It doesn't matter. We'll never win. Don't worry. I'll get you some intense poker training. If that worked, we wouldn't need the police. What? Nothing. I'm just blabbering. -What's going on? -Yeah. They're here. -They actually showed up. -That's him. They really came. I thought they'd run away. The outcome won't change. We'll wait and see how badly they lose. Open the door. Why me? You're a girl. Ladies first. Together. Fine, together. Three, two, one. Why didn't you move? My legs are wobbly. One more time. Three, two, one. Welcome to the Poker Room. I'm the referee today. Come in. What an extraordinary match. To be honest, I'm feeling a bit nervous now. Give us all you've got, F4! I, Chen Qinghe, and Shancai will do whatever it takes. If you guys lose today, you'll be at my mercy. You'll carry my bag for the day. Just one day? Make it ten years. You won't win anyway. You... Don't underestimate us. What if I win? What do you want? You two will do whatever I want. -Okay. -I... Agreed. -Qinghe. -Don't be scared. I'm here. Take a seat. We'll begin the match. You two might as well just admit defeat. We'll never do that. No need to waste time with them. Taking advantage of people who don't know Poker and winning should not be something you should brag about. Subtitle translation by Jay Wong
