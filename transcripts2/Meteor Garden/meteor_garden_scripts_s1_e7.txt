 I ordered too much. Eat. I'm not hungry. I don't care. You can only go after you finish eating. You're too skinny. I'm going to make you fatter. Why do you want to do that? I'm not a pig. Are you sure you're not? You're the pig. I wish someone would make me fat like a pig. That's right. I've known you forever, but never saw you so considerate. Shut up, you two. Eat up. All right. I'll just eat the ribs. How much was the jacket? I'll pay you back. What are you talking about?

 I was never taught to ask the girl to pay. Shancai still doesn't admit that Daoming Si is his boyfriend? She says one thing, but does another. Do you believe her? Who knows what's on her mind? What? You're not hungry? Look at you. Slow down. -Hello? -Where are you? I'm near the cafeteria. I'll come up. No! Don't come here. I'll go to you. Was that a guy or a girl? None of your business. I'm warning you. You're dead meat if you do anything with another guy. I'm full. I have to go. Hey, where are you going? Hey, Shancai. Shancai, I'm-- -Come with me. -Where to? Hey. Isn't that Thomas from last night? He came to school. A minute ago, she was eating with Daoming Si. Now, she's going on a date with Thomas. That Shancai sure is something. Hey, why did you come to our school? You called me, but didn't finish what you were saying. I was worried something had happened. Did you do something bad to me? -Of course I did. -What? You puked everywhere. You were filthy. I cleaned you up and let you rest on the bed. And? And then, I left the hotel. Really? Really. All right. That's good then. -I need to go. -Hey. Wait, Shancai. You put your head on my shoulder that day and said that you like me. Is it true? Sorry. I got confused. I like you too. Why don't you go out with me? I mistook you for someone else that day. What are you two doing? Daoming Si. Who is this guy? I'm warning you. You're dead meat if you do anything with another guy. He's... He's just asking for directions. Directions? Why did he grab your shoulders? I'll ask him. Hello. I was asking her for directions. Listen carefully. She's my woman. Don't touch her. So this pretty girl already has a boyfriend. That's too bad. What's too bad? I'm warning you. Stay away from her. I'm going. Hey. Daoming Si. What language were you two using? French. You actually know French? What's so surprising? As the heir of the Daoming Group, it's normal to know many languages. Really? Then... What were you two talking about? I told him you're my girlfriend and asked him to get lost. What? Why are you making up stories? He's obviously taking advantage of you and pretending to be lost. You're so naive. How silly! You're the silly one. I'm not dating you. Why do you keep butting in? We're not going out? Hey! What the hell? He's making me feel guilty. MINGDE UNIVERSITY POKER CLUB What? This is unbelievable. What is it? -My gosh. -Hey, did you guys see? -Yes. -Wow. I can't believe she did that. Look. That's her. Isn't that her? I don't believe it. Isn't that her? Yeah. -It's her. -It's her. -Yes. -It's her. Don't be ridiculous. Shancai would never do that. We're not making it up. She really did lean on the foreigner that day. Yes. I even have a photo of her dancing with Thomas. See? You're lying. That's not Shancai. The photo is fake. There's the girl we're talking about. Ask her yourself. Dong Shancai. You spent the night with Thomas, right? Look at this. UGLY DUCKLING DONG SHANCAI CHEATS ON DAOMING SI AND SPENDS A NIGHT WITH A FRENCH GUY? See? She's not denying it. You're the only one who still thinks she's innocent. Why did you two set me up? Shancai, we're not the ones who posted the photos. Don't yell at us. Right. You're responsible for your own actions. I can't believe you did that to Daoming Si. Stop harassing her! Shancai. This is a misunderstanding, right? Just explain it to them. Shancai! Hello. Do you know the long-haired pianist named Thomas? Do you know where he is? -Thomas? -Yes. That foreigner just filled in for the day. I'm not sure where he is. Isn't Si acting weird? He's been swimming back and forth for an hour. I'm not surprised. He must have been annoyed by Shancai again. I thought Si would've gotten Shancai in the elevator that night. I didn't think he'd drag it out like this. Logically speaking, any girl who has gone out with an F4 would always call back. They'd ask when the second date is. -How many girls called you today? -Do you want to see? No way. -What? -Look at this. What the hell is wrong with you? We're too old for pranks like that. Where's my phone? Sorry. The person you have reached is unavailable. Please try again later. Sorry. The person you have reached... What is the photo about? Why did you frame me? Shancai. We saw the photo. What happened between you and that foreigner? It's not true. It's a misunderstanding. That night, Xinhui, Baihe, and Li Zhen went out for a ladies' night. I did dance with that guy. But nothing else happened. So what's the photo about? I'm not sure. Sorry. The person you have reached is unavailable. Please try again later. Why would Daoming Si fall for a shameless girl like her? Dong Shancai, you should be ashamed of yourself. You've embarrassed Mingde. Dong Shancai, whom are you really dating? Do you like Daoming Si or that foreigner? I wonder what Daoming Si sees in you. Poor Si. I can't believe he likes you. How did it end up like this? I must not run. Running away means I'm guilty. I didn't do anything wrong. Why should I hide? -It's her. -Yes. Ignore her. -How dare she show up? -Right? Excuse me. She's sitting in front. She's really sitting here. -Should we move? -Gosh. -Let's go. -Come on. -Let's go. -Let's go. Go. Damn you. Why won't you answer my calls? Are you hiding from me? Why did you post that photo online? Face me in person instead of playing dirty! What kind of a man are you? REENACTING ENGLISH SCENARIO Let's have two students come up for an impromptu session. You should call up Shancai. Her English is excellent. -Okay. -Right? Yes, her English is outstanding. Yes, let her do it. She knows a lot of foreigners. I'm sure she learned something. Hey, stop making up stories, okay? I didn't make it up. Did I make it up? Let's go. So I don't think Thomas lives in Shanghai. He's probably gone back to France. I think one of Thomas' friends shared the photos, and they were set up. I wonder who's trying to hurt Shancai. Hey, you two. When can I get my phone back? It's still being repaired. You don't have class this afternoon. Why? I can't come if I don't have class? Sure, you can. Hey. What were you two looking at? You're being so secretive. We were watching a romantic action movie. -You won't like it. -Romance action. Liars. I doubt you were watching a movie. -Show me. I want to see. -Hey! Si! What do we do? UGLY DUCKLING DONG SHANCAI CHEATS ON DAOMING SI Who is this guy? He's just asking for directions. I get it now. They lied to me. Asking for directions? Directions, my ass. -Hey, Si. -Si. -Calm down. Shancai is actually-- -Get off! Si. -What now? -Let's go after him. Take this to the classroom first and then the rest. Are you okay? I'm fine. We're sorry. Isn't she... Let's go. Daoming Si. That foreigner wasn't asking for directions, was he? He's... You two went to a hotel, didn't you? No. Nothing happened with him. Those photos on Weibo are a misunderstanding. Then why did you lie to me? I did lie about who he was, but there's nothing between us. I don't care if everyone believes the rumors and nobody believes me. It's fine with me. As long as... As long as you still trust me. We've been sitting here for three hours. How long are we going to wait? I think all my blood will be sucked dry by the mosquitoes. I'll be a master mosquito killer before the night ends. Si must be outraged. The girl who the almighty Daoming Si likes has become the girl everyone hates and criticizes. You know what? -If it happened to us-- -No way. We'd never like a girl to that extent. Or we should say there is no girl that we can't handle. You're right. But why must three people suffer when only one person is broken-hearted? Lei is so lucky he isn't here. I think we won't get through to Si right now. There are two options. One, get him drunk and drag him home. Two, knock him out and drag him home. This is all the alcohol left. We'll have to use force then. Hey, I'll do it. -I'll do it. -Let me. -I'll do it. -Me... -I'll... -Let me. Where's Si? Hey, why are you standing here? -Si. -Si. -Why are you sitting here? -Why are you sitting here? Shancai. Why? Why did you lie to me? You want me to trust you, right? Why did you lie then? You're awake. Where am I? My house. How did I get here? You were drunk last night. I didn't know where to take you. I'm going then. I made breakfast. -Have some before you go. -It's okay. -I'll help you. -Get off. Daoming Si. Do you really hate me that much? Can you at least tell me why you hate me? I don't hate you. I just don't care. How am I different from Shancai? We are both from an average family. We're both plain-looking. We are girls that blend into the background. Why do you like Shancai but not even notice me? Shut up. I know. You like girls like Shancai, who look innocent and naive, but jump on a guy any chance she gets. If that's the case, I can do it too. -Take your hands off or I'll make you. -I won't. If that's what you want, I can be like Shancai too. I can be loud and bold, pretending to be strong. I can do everything you want. I'll become whatever you want me to be. Don't compare yourself to Shancai. -She's not like you. -How? Shancai would never do that. Who on earth posted those photos? Why did that Thomas suddenly disappear? I don't know. So what are you going to do now? Aren't you going to clear your name? I know I didn't do anything wrong. I believe that justice will prevail. I believe the truth will be revealed soon. Hang in there. Yeah. I don't give a damn. Well? You can't have me even if you give me everything in the world. If I were you, I would feel very lonely. I would probably become rebellious. I don't care if everyone believes the rumors and nobody believes me. It's fine with me. As long as... As long as you still trust me. What am I doing? How could I do this to her? TALENT'S TEA SHOP Hey. Doesn't she look familiar to you? Isn't she the girl we met in the alley that day? -Come here. -Hey, what are you doing? Let me go! Let me go! Let go! Let me go! Let go! Let me go! Miss, we meet again. Stay away. You bit me! You bastards will get what's coming for you! Sorry, I'm late. Do you believe me? If you say you didn't do it, I believe you. -Mr. Liu, prepare a bath. -Okay. It hurts! Can you be more gentle? I'm treating your wound. There's no need to yell. People would think I'm hurting you. Who told you to go to my house and ask my mom where I work? Who would've saved you if I hadn't gone to the shop? But you shouldn't have told them that I'm staying at your place. They may get the wrong idea. I saved you. I'm letting you stay here. But instead of thanking me, you're complaining? Thanks. What? I can't hear you. There's no need to yell. Hey. Nothing happened between you and that foreigner, right? You're an idiot. I barely knew him. Why would I do anything with him? That had better be true. I'm so angry, I could kill him. Why are you so pissed off? -Are you jealous? -Yes, I am. I'm really jealous! Because I like you. You... Wait. Not even for 0.5 seconds. I'm going to sleep. Hey. Where's the guest room? The third room on the right. -Okay. -Shancai. I mean it. Think about it. I don't believe it. Daoming Si actually likes me? And I didn't stop him from kissing me. What is wrong with me? Yes? Come with me. She's in there. What's going on? The person who posted those photos is inside. See for yourself. Li Zhen? Shancai. Why are you guys here? Come in. My place is a bit messy. I hope you don't mind. Have a seat. It looks like someone is still feigning innocence. What do you mean? I think you made a mistake. Li Zhen can't be the one who set me up. Li Zhen. You went to high school with Shancai and attended Mingde University too. Thomas left and couldn't be reached, but we did some digging. The Weibo user that posted those defamatory photos was you. Spit it out. Why did you do it? Why? Well... Perhaps you prefer to settle it in court. I'll call the lawyer. No. Fine. I admit it. I posted those photos online. So you set me up with Thomas? Then how did you get the photos? That night, Thomas invited you to dance. You two were having so much fun. I could tell he was interested in you. Hi. -I feel sick. I need to go. -Hey. -Can you look after my friend for me? -All right. Can you send me a photo wherever you go later? Just so I'd know she's safe. All right. Don't worry. I dropped your friend off at the hotel safely. The next day, Thomas called me to say he likes you and wanted to see you. I saw you two looking really friendly on campus. But then... -Daoming Si. -I saw you and Daoming Si arguing by the school entrance. Who is this guy? He's just asking for directions. Why did he grab your shoulders? I'll ask him. Listen carefully. She's my woman. Don't touch her. So this pretty girl already has a boyfriend. I was furious as I looked at the photo Thomas had sent. So I shared it. POST TO WEIBO I don't understand. Aren't we good friends? Why were you furious? Good friends? Sorry, but that's too big of a burden for me. What do you mean? What "good friends"? Did you think about me when Qinghe -invited you to Sanya with F4? -Qinghe was the one who invited me. At the time, I didn't know F4 was going to be there. What about lying to me about Jing's birthday party and then embarrassing me by not picking up my call? My phone was dead at Jing's party. I called you after that, didn't I? You said you couldn't come because you were busy. I wasn't busy. I couldn't get in. You couldn't get in? I wore an expensive dress that cost three times my monthly living expenses. I stood at the door of Jing's house. I called you many times, I couldn't get through. While you guys were having fun inside, I stood out in the rain and denied entry by the guards. They wouldn't let me in no matter what I said. Did you consider how I felt? -I did call you! -Don't you get it? Jing's invitation was meant for you. It was for Dong Shancai. It didn't matter that my dress cost 6,000 yuan. I'm just a supporting character. Your accessory. Nobody pays attention to me. I could attend the party because I'm Shancai's friend, not because I'm Li Zhen. Why would you think that? I'm not imagining things. It's the truth. That's the saddest part. If you really believed that, why didn't you tell me how you felt? Because I have my pride too, okay? You're just jealous of Shancai. Yes, I admit it. That day, I realized while walking home in the rain. No matter how hard I try, or how much effort I put in to please others, it won't matter. I should learn from you. Have a pair of innocent-looking eyes. Pretend to be nice. Play hard to get with guys. After hurting someone, just brush it off by saying it wasn't intentional. Even if that were true, you shouldn't have done what you did to defame and hurt me! You made people turn on me. That's because I wanted you to know how it felt to be hated. Get off. Just like what I've had to endure. Don't compare yourself to Shancai. She's not like you. Li Zhen. I am so disappointed in you. I can't believe this is what you thought of me. If you're unhappy with me, just tell me. Why did you have to resort to that and stab me in the back? You don't deserve to be my friend. Whatever. The point is, I don't need a friend like you either. I no longer care. I'm really sad. So sad that I wish I could hit you and scold you. But I have nothing to say to you. Li Zhen. There are many things that are unfair in this world. But that doesn't mean you should treat yourself unfairly. Subtitle translation by Jay Wong
