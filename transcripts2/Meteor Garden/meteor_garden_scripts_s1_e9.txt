 Where is Daoming Si? He isn't feeling well today, so he's absent. The notes last time... Oh, sure. You can borrow it. -Okay, thanks. -No worries. Lei. -Let's talk. -It's Lei. You know something? He's seeing Shancai. -Really? -Yeah. Lei. You know Si likes Shancai a lot, right? I know. What is there to talk about?

 Huaze Lei. What is going on? Are you really dating Shancai? No way, right? You wouldn't do something to hurt your friend. Lei, have you lost your mind after losing Jing? You could've gotten any another girl. -You know Shancai is Si's-- -Ximen! Si. Lei, listen carefully. From today onward, you are no longer my friend! Si. Are you really going to kill our friendship over a girl? I'm not the one who killed our friendship. It was Huaze Lei. Si, don't do this. Hey, did you have notes from our last class? Yes. Can I take a look at it? I was busy with work. Sure, no problem. What's wrong with Daoming Si? Did you two have a fight? Let's go. -Want some? -Sure. Here. Daoming Si. It looks like him, right? That must be how he's looking right now. No. I think something is missing. His eyebrows are thicker, like earthworms. Not to mention, he must be so angry right now. We need to make him look fierce. That looks like him. What can I say? I know his angry face all too... Sorry. Why are you sorry? If I didn't go looking for you on the beach, none of this would've happened. You and Daoming Si would still be friends. It's all my fault. I kissed you because I wanted to. So, it's my fault. Let's go on a date on Sunday. A date? Honey. I'm struggling to make a decision. Should I use the whitening one or the moisturizing one? Is this worth struggling over? Use the whitening product during daytime for glowing skin. Use the moisturizing product at night to replenish moisture. Good idea. I'll use this. Shancai, you look nice today. Are you going on a date? I'm going out with a friend. Is it Daoming Si? No. Who is it then? A guy or a girl? How old? Are they from your school? Which year? You wouldn't know even if I told you. Try us. We'll know once you tell us. You're right. Follow me. I'm coming. You are... Sir, ma'am. Nice to meet you. I'm Huaze Lei. Shancai's schoolmate. This boy looks so adorable. He has such fair skin, big eyes, double eyelids, and a sharp nose. You don't look like a typical Chinese guy. I wonder how your parents look. He's got such delicate features. A lot like me when I was younger. It's getting late. We need to go. Bye, sir, ma'am. Bye. Go. Hurry up. Our daughter is just like me. She's attracting all the right men. One seems like a domineering CEO, Daoming Si. The other, a pretty and gentle boy, Huaze Lei. They're both great options. Sure. You attracted all the right men. That's why you got me. You were the least among all my options. Sorry about that. My parents are overly friendly. I hope they didn't scare you. Not at all. I think they're very cute. You're dressed a little differently today. Is it weird? No, you look good. I overslept today, so I just put these on and ran out. Where do you want to go? Any place in mind? I don't know. How about you? I don't know either. How about... this restaurant I always go to? Let's go eat. Okay. Fine with me. Whatever you want. Oh no. This is so awkward. Huaze Lei isn't saying anything. Should I think of a topic to discuss? Huaze Lei. Do you remember that spot? Jing's poster was there before. You were looking at Jing so intently. -And then-- -Shancai. Don't talk about Jing. Sorry. I shouldn't have brought her up. It's okay. Let's go. Dong Shancai, you're an idiot. Huaze Lei is obviously trying hard to forget about Jing. Why did you have to bring her up? Shancai. This is the first time I'm on a real date with a girl. If I make you bored, I apologize. Now that I think about it, apart from Si and the guys, I don't have many friends. I guess I'm a social outcast. I don't think so. I think you have the best personality among the F4 guys. Besides, you're cool and laidback. So if you wanted to, you'd make many new friends. Wasn't that funny? It was a pun. You know, you're "laid" back. Like Lei. Laid. Never mind. I guess it wasn't funny. I like hearing you say my name. Lei. Lei. Lei. Lei... Sorry. -Sorry. -It's okay. Why are you panting? No reason. No reason. It's spicy. This Thai restaurant is good and cheap. Especially this dish, the Thai-style beef salad. Do you want to try it? You don't like Thai food? I can't really eat spicy food. I'm sorry. I should've been more considerate. I should've asked you what you like to eat. It's okay. As long as you like it. Why don't we order something less spicy? It's okay. I'm not that hungry. It's really spicy. Shancai. That's for washing your hands. You're so funny. Are you still hungry? Here, you can have mine too. Here you go. TALENT'S TEA SHOP What? That's how the date ended? Yeah. It was almost time for work, so I hurried over here. My goodness. What kind of a date was that? It doesn't sound romantic at all. I know. Weirdly enough, it was so awkward. I get so nervous when I'm around Huaze Lei. I become so self-conscious. How about Si? Him? You two dated before, right? Do you get self-conscious around him? We weren't dating. But... Now that you mention it, I think I am more myself when I'm with him. But that's because I don't have feelings for him. That's why we're always arguing. He's so self-centered and always pissing people off. I don't have time to worry about looking stupid or lame. Which means, you feel more self-conscious when you're with Huaze Lei. That's because... It's because I want to show him the best side of me. That's why I'm self-conscious. The more I care, the more nervous I get. The more nervous I am, the more anxious I get. When you like someone, is feeling attracted to them so important? Isn't feeling at ease around them more important? Next time you give me your clothes, at least make it an expensive one. It's getting cold. Put it on. No. Calm down. The one I like is Lei, not Si. Hey! -Watch out. -Ma'am. Watch where you're going! Are you blind? Hey! How unreasonable can you get? Watch where you're going! You knocked her down. Take her to the hospital. What the hell? It's not my problem that she can't see. Stay right there! -Take her to the hospital. -Get off me! Hey. -You're asking for it. -You don't scare me. How dare you pick on a girl? You call yourself a man? Go and apologize! -Take her to the hospital, do you hear me? -Okay, I will. Sorry about that. Are you okay? We're going. Bye. Are you okay? I'm fine. Thank you. Your hand is bleeding. How is this fine? Let's get it treated at my house. It's okay. I can clean the wound myself. No. -This is bad. Come to my house. -It's really okay. Hush. We'll treat it at my house. This is bad. You can't do it yourself. Why did this lady bring me to Si's house? What's her relationship with him? Oh no. If I see Daoming Si here... Miss, this is just a small wound. -I can treat it myself. -No. It's not fine. It's still bleeding. Don't worry. Make yourself comfortable. I'm Daoming Zhuang. Just call me Ms. Zhuang. She's Daoming Si's older sister? You look pale. We need to get this treated. Mr. Liu, I'm back. Ms. Zhuang, welcome back. Ms. Shancai? You know her? Ms. Shancai goes to the same school as Si. What a coincidence. No need to be so awkward then. Mr. Liu, bring me the first aid kit. -And call Si to come greet her. -Okay. Wait! Ms. Zhuang. I just remembered I've got something to do. -I need to-- -No. Mr. Liu, clean her wound. You don't seem to understand my orders. This way. Maybe I should sneak out right now. Daoming Si. Why are you here? This is just a coincidence. Coincidence? Did you come to brag about your new boyfriend? No, I'm not. Don't get me wrong. Stop pretending, Shancai. Who do you think you are? I'm not sad at all. I'm already over you. You're hurting me. Is that how you speak to a girl? You're embarrassing our family. Are you okay? I'm fine. Zhuang, when did you come back? What? Can't I come home? You haven't seen me in a while. Didn't you miss me? I did. I video call you all the time, don't I? You only tell me useless stuff. So what? I'm going to treat this girl's wound. Wait... Not bad, right? -Thanks, Ms. Zhuang. -You're welcome. Si used to get into fights and got injured all the time, and I'd treat his wounds. Why am I not surprised? You must be hungry. Stay for dinner. No, I don't want to trouble you. What do you mean? If I say we're having dinner, that's what we'll do. This family produces domineering children like a production line. They're exactly the same. Si said he has an important report to finish for school, so he went out. Did I hear correctly? He isn't going to eat with me? He's going to get a beating when he gets home. You may leave. Shancai. Drink with me. I... Okay. I'll drink a little bit. Just this glass. Come on. Ms. Zhuang. There's something -I want to tell you. -Go ahead. Actually, not long ago, Daoming Si asked me out. I did something very terrible. I hurt him. I caused him to turn against Huaze Lei. It's fine that he's angry with me. It's my own fault. I'm the one to blame. That's why I feel really terrible that I'm sitting here. Huaze Lei? Yes. -I really-- -Hey. Speak up. I can't hear you. I really don't want to see Daoming Si sad and hurt. A person like me... is no good to begin with. That stupid girl. She didn't learn her lesson after getting drunk last time. Si. Is she your girlfriend? A schoolmate. This schoolmate of yours is pretty special. She's got a sense of justice like I do. An old lady was being bullied. She and I stood up to the man that was bullying her. She's a loser herself, but she fights for others. Who? Her, of course. Zhuang, your kicks hurt, okay? Do you miss the days when I used to beat you up? Why would I? By the way, how's her hand? Why? Are you concerned? Of course not. I don't care at all. Si. Carry her to the guest room. No! Why should I carry her? You brought her here. Just do as I say. You can't expect me to carry her. This is an order. Zhuang. She's as heavy as a pig. What a pain. How can she fall asleep right now? That's what happened with Shancai. I see. So she's the reason Si looks like a zombie. Why does he always make people worry? Here. The honey water will help your hangover. Thanks, Ms. Zhuang. Sorry. I always fall asleep when I'm drunk. -It's okay. You can sleep if you want. -No. Shancai. I hope you'll reconsider Si. -Ms. Zhuang. You must be mistaken. -I know. -You know? -Yes. Mr. Liu told me. I could guess your relationship. You know what? You're the first girl Si brought home. You must think that Si's a playboy, but he's actually clueless about love. I know he's a snob. That's because our parents were always busy running the business. They had no time to teach Si and me. We got to do whatever we wanted. When we're mad, we vent at other people. That's why the two of us are so obnoxious. Other than Ximen, Meizuo, Huaze Lei, Si has never made other friends. I'll give you these if you play with me. I'll give you these if you play with me. Play with me and each of you gets a ball. For free. You must be dumb, Daoming Si. To be frank, he didn't know how to interact with people. The more people avoided him, the more he acted out in anger. I was much too young then. I didn't know how to teach him apart from scolding and hitting him. Shancai. Si is actually a kind person. He's not mean at all. He just doesn't know how to express himself. Actually, he's just a big kid that wants to be loved. I'm not trying to force you two together. But I can tell that you do care about him. So I hope you'd think about it some more. Lei. Who said you could talk to him? Si. How long are you going to keep this up? Yeah, Si. Stop with the grudge. We can't just disband F4 like this. Shancai! Shancai. Shancai, I brought some bananas from home. What's wrong? I didn't bring extra for you guys. Who said the F4 is disbanding? He'll be the new F4 member. What? Shancai. Did you hear what Si just said? I'm going to be part of F4. Also, you're forbidden to talk to them. That's impossible. Shancai is my best friend. She's a friend of F4 too, right? Si. How could you be so heartless? What? I'm going to do everything I can to make them suffer. That's what they get for hurting me. Si, if you go on like this, our friendship will go up in smoke. I couldn't care less. What kind of friendship is this? Since no one cares, let's just disband. Si. Are you done? I'm disappointed in you. You people have made me more disappointed. Stop it, you guys. The friendship between the four of us should outweigh everything. Why has it come to this? Why? Is it my fault? It's your fault, Lei. Si. Just deal with me alone. Very well. I will. Wait. I'll say two things. And then I'll go. You have one left. What happened is my fault. It's fine if you won't forgive me, but I will still apologize. I'll take responsibility. But you and Lei have been friends since childhood. I hope you won't give up on your friendship because of me. You were bullied many times, but you never backed down. Yet you're apologizing to me because of him. Do you care that much about him? Fine. You want to take responsibility? Yes. As long as you let Lei go. Daoming Si. If you want to punish someone, punish me. Lei. If you say so. I'll give you what you want. Let's play for it. Don't sit there. It's okay. Sit. That's Lei's spot. Lei is no longer a part of the F4. That seat belongs to you now. Sit. Si, can you stop fooling around? Grow up, will you? Can't we just talk this out? What? Why are you so angry with Lei? Aren't you all friends? It's because he's my friend that I can't forgive him. Do you guys really think Huaze Lei likes Shancai? The only girl he likes is Jing. But Jing is getting married so he's using Shancai to get over her. That stupid girl can't see that. So, are you still going to defend that selfish bastard? Are you saying that Lei is playing with Shancai? Is that it? Is it? You know what? -That Shancai is so annoying. -She should hide somewhere. Every day, she's... She's right there. Did you see her? HUAZE LEI AND DAOMING SI ARE NO LONGER FRIENDS. IT'S SHANCAI'S FAULT. EVEN HER NAME ANNOYS ME. Shancai! Shancai, what happened to you and Daoming Si? It's my fault. To be fair, they aren't wrong. Daoming Si and Huaze Lei are fighting because of me. Shancai. I really don't get it. Daoming Si treats you so nicely. Why did you choose Huaze Lei? I'm not sure. So if you and Huaze Lei win, what are you going to ask for? Me? I will just ask Daoming Si and Huaze Lei to rekindle their friendship. But friendship isn't something you can salvage like that. Then I hope... that Daoming Si will forgive me. Everyone was having fun together during the break. Why did it suddenly become like this? Ms. Shancai, Si is not back yet. -Is Ms. Zhuang in? -Yes. Ms. Zhuang, you have to think of something. This is the Red Robe tea. It's famous in Mount Wuyi. I bought it specially from Ximen's family. I'll get Mr. Liu to pack some for you if you like it. Try those snacks too. I can't finish them alone. Ms. Zhuang, are you listening to me at all? I heard you. Si sent you a Joker card. Huaze Lei received it too. So, you have to help me talk to Si. How did Si and Lei end up like this? It was me. Then what good will I do? You're his sister. I'm sure he'll listen to you. If you're the cause, you should be the one to solve it. So you mean I should leave, and Huaze Lei will be okay? I thought you're a smart girl. Why don't you figure it out? I'm saying only you can change Si's mind. Only you can end this cold war. Only I can change his mind? So you want me to challenge Daoming Si in poker and win? That's impossible. No! You must use this. The heart? Huaze Lei. Teach me poker. I'll do my best to learn. Listen up, Daoming Si. Don't assume that I'm scared. I didn't come here to surrender. I've made up my mind. I'll team up with Huaze Lei and play poker with you. I might not know how to play now, but... Maybe after some lessons, I'll turn into a dark horse in poker. Ms. Zhuang also agreed that I might succeed as long as I do my best. Why aren't you saying anything? I hope you're not... Just say you like me and I'll cancel the bet with Huaze Lei. Just say it, okay? Say it. Let me go. You're hurting me. Say it. Say you like me! Stop it. Do you hate me that much? Why are you asking a question I have no answer to? Why must it be Lei? Why did it have to be my friend? I must be stupid. Why do I have to like you? You're so old-fashioned and ugly. You have a huge face, no figure, and no brain. Are you sure you and Lei want to challenge me? Yes. -I'm willing to accept the consequences. -What if you lose? I will do my best to beat you. You'd better not regret it later. And... I'm not going to go easy on you. Just so you know. Daoming Si! I'm not going to back down. I won't regret it either. That's the Shancai I know. There may come a time when I will regret what I did today. But right now, I don't want Huaze Lei to face this alone. Subtitle translation by Jay Wong
