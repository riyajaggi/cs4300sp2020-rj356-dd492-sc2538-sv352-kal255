 You must be very important to him. That's impossible. Huaze Lei likes you, Jing. I guess. Do you like Huaze Lei too? Your clothes and shoes are wet. I have some clean clothes. You can wear them. I don't need to change. Girls should always be clean and stylish. Put them on. Thank you, Jing. Those shoes are so pretty. Every girl should have a pair of nice shoes.

 They can take you to beautiful places. Shancai, are you okay? I'm fine. Are you wearing new shoes? They look nice. Jing gave them to me. Qinghe. Today was so embarrassing. Shancai, I'm sorry. When Daoming Si was picking on you, I should have punched him. No, you can't win against him. You're not the one he's picking on. If he picks on you again, I'll never forgive him. I... I'll start learning taekwondo. I'm sorry, Qinghe. Because of me, you got into trouble. What are you talking about? It's very challenging to be able to fight with people like F4. Also, I can stand by your side. I think it's meaningful and fun. -Fun? -Yes, just like Fantasy Westward Journey. I used to be so weak, I couldn't beat anyone. But you encouraged me, now I can even beat the bosses in the game. Together, we can beat the whole world. So, I worried about you for nothing. By the way, my family has a villa in Sanya. A villa? Do you want to go there during the national holiday? Do you think I can go with my allowance? We're friends. Money's not an issue. Trust me, it's really fun there. There's a waterfall and an aquarium. My dad was going to take my aunts there, but my uncle... My uncle's kid got married, so they canceled. It will be just the two of us. Shancai. Shancai, what's wrong? Shancai. Help! Three times a day. -One pill each time. -I'm telling you, if she doesn't get better, we still have to pay tuition -even if she's not going. -One pill each time. If she can't go to class, she'll miss out. Yeah. The tuition is very expensive. Don't listen to your mom. The tuition is very expensive. Here you go, sweetheart. Let me see. You're getting better. Do I need to take that many pills? If you don't take them, you'll get worse. Yes, you should listen to the doctor. Who is it? Shancai, your classmate is here to see you. Who is it? Qinghe? No, it's a tall and handsome boy. -Shancai, come here. -Handsome? Let me see how handsome he is. Am I looking into a mirror? He's so handsome and so tall. You're too kind. You didn't have to bring all these gifts. How dare you come to my house? Dad, Mom, kick him out. He's Daoming Si, the guy that made me sick. Daoming Si? Do you mean that Daoming Si? The son of Daoming Feng, the famous businesswoman? My mother succeeded because she worked hard. Cut out the act. You're an immature jerk who picks on everyone. I think Shancai must have misunderstood me. I'm here to apologize. Yes, he's a guest at our house. Be polite. Daoming Si, Shancai never thinks before she talks. -Please don't be offended. -Yes. We're very honored that you could visit our humble abode today. -Yes. -Please come in. -Right here. -Come in. Your house looks small, but I never thought that it would be this small. That's because you're tall, Daoming Si. -It's perfect for us. -Yes. Are you done, Daoming Si? Thank you for visiting. The door's over there. You can go now. Daoming Si, Shancai still has a bit of a fever. That's why she's saying rude things. Please don't be mad. Yes. We're preparing dinner now. -Yes. -If you don't mind, would you be willing to have dinner with us? I think that Daoming Si wouldn't like eating the normal food we eat. Our food isn't delicious at all. If you don't like it and throw it in my face, my mom will beat you up. That's nonsense. Do I look mean? You're the nicest mom I've ever seen. Yes. I'm really good at cooking. Why don't you have dinner here? I'll have to agree. Wonderful. Here. Try my signature dish. -Sweet and sour pork ribs. -Thank you. Look familiar? You're probably not hungry. If you don't like it, you can spit it out. You weren't lying. This is delicious. What's this? This is braised minced eel. It's a classic dish. Eel? Yellow eel. The dirty, stinky kind that lives in swamps. It tastes great. Did you hear that? He likes it. -Thank you so much. -No, I should thank you. What? Is there a fish bone in your throat? I told you so many times, don't laugh when you're eating. Look at you... Why are you still here? Get some vinegar. Have you ever seen a fish bone in an eel? -Then... -Let's eat now. What's she laughing about? She... She's happy because her classmate is here. Right? Don't get so worked up. Let's eat. Have some more. I cooked this for you. For me? As if I'm not plump enough. This is the first time I've seen Daoming Si being so polite. He ate everything in his bowl. I told you to eat it. What? -Are you trying to make me mad? -Are you mad? Thank you for having me. I'm full. It's getting late now. I should head home. So soon? Don't you want to stay a bit longer? No, it's okay. thank you. You're very polite. Shancai, stop eating. See your classmate out. Mom, I have a fever. You look very healthy. Just walk him out. Go. I... Hurry up! It's all his fault. Look at what I'm wearing. Your parents seem to like me. Okay. You're outside now. Stop pretending. What are you trying to do? I'm pretending? I never lie. Stop acting. Aren't you here to make fun of me? Now that I'm sick, are you happy now? I'm not happy at all. Let me see. Who gets a fever on a hot day like this? What did you say? Why did you come to my house? What are you doing for the seven-day holiday? Not much. I want to go to Hawaii. Are you interested? Hawaii... The tickets are super expensive. Probably around 50 thousand. 50 thousand? -Do I look like I have that money? -You don't? I don't even have 500 yuan. How would I have 50 thousand? If you don't even have 500, where are you going? I'll pay for you. -Why are you paying for me? -Because you don't have money. And you don't have anywhere to go. Who said I don't have anywhere to go? Where are you going then? I... I'm going to Qinghe's family villa in Sanya. It's big and beautiful. You can surf, snorkel, and eat tons of seafood there. You're going with Qinghe? That lame guy? Yes. We've been planning it. I'm so glad that during those seven days, I won't have to see you. You... You think I want to see you? -Best if we don't. -Bye! Bye forever! Your house is over there, tiny girl. I know. Si. Did you go to visit a sick friend? Who said that? I went to say something. Just to say something, okay? You're joking around again. You mean you went to threaten someone? You know what I mean. By the way, this is your packing list for your trip to Hawaii next week. You can see if anything's missing. Who said I'm going to Hawaii? This is so much fun! I shouldn't have thought of you like that -You suck at singing. -That's not true! I want to laugh -And have fun -And have fun We're here at the beach! We're here! I'm Shancai! I'm Qinghe! F4 can go to hell! Say it. F4 can go to hell! -Let's take a picture. -Okay. -What do you think? -It's beautiful. This is my family's villa. Isn't it awesome? -Can I go in? -Of course. -Wait for me. -Hurry up. Look. The person who sold us this lamp said Jack Ma has the same one. Really? It's a very extravagant lamp. Let me find you a room with a view of the lamp. Let's go. This is the living room. It's so pretty. Right? You can see the lamp through the window. So this beautiful house is usually empty? We rent it out as a bed and breakfast. See? You can earn extra money and also make new friends. They even have cleaning services. -Isn't that awesome? -It is. Let me take you to one more place. Come on. There are so many yachts. Look, my family bought one too. That big? Is it big? It's pretty cool, right? It must be super expensive. It's not that one. It's the one in front of it. Want to go on it? -Sure. -Let's go. All aboard! QINGHE Why aren't we moving yet? I don't understand. My dad taught me how to do this. Why isn't it starting? Why do I feel like that person looks familiar? It's Daoming Si. Daoming Si? Isn't he in Hawaii? Why is he here? Isn't that F4? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Let's go. Let's go. Daoming Si, why are you here? Why are you here? I can go wherever I want on this planet. Do I need to have a reason why? Is that your family's boat? Can it go out to sea? I think you can only go around the pond. Who said so? I went fishing on it one time. So it's a fishing boat? Shancai, we meet again. Jing. You're here too? I was just saying that these boys are making me bored. Then, you appeared. We're having a party tonight. You should come. I wouldn't want to cause trouble. I'd ruin the atmosphere. That's not true. The more, the merrier. Right, Lei? Yes, you should come. Can I come too? Don't worry. I'll be there, so Si won't pick on you. Come on. I'll do your makeup. Then we'll pick a dress. NOW LIVE Ximen, are you using Now Live? I want to be on it too. Jing, you're so pretty. You're pretty too. Has Daoming Si made up with Huaze Lei? I don't think so. Si is kind of immature. He hasn't been talking to Lei. Ximen and I persuaded Lei to come along. Don't worry. Si has always been very impulsive. His temper comes and goes quickly. He'll get over it soon. As for Lei, I don't think anything in this world could make him mad. Oh, this is a gift for you. Thank you, Jing. My birthday is next week. I invited some friends. You should come. Your birthday? It must be a huge event. Don't worry, I won't invite those girls at school. -Can I bring my friends? -Of course. As long as they're your friends, you can bring them all. -Thank you, Jing. -Okay. Let's get you a dress. I'm going to make you so pretty to surprise everyone. Why are there so many girls? Are they your friends? Bye. Shancai. You look so cute like this. Girls really need to dress up. Jing has impeccable taste. Even Shancai looks amazing with Jing's help. Right, Si? Si! You're exaggerating. She looks fine. Shancai. You look really pretty today. I... I have a stomachache. Wait. NOW LIVE Gosh. I was wondering who tackled me. It was you. You almost knocked my teeth out. Hey. What kind of expression is that? Was that... Was that your first kiss? Oh my god, I have the worst luck. I can't believe I gave that pineapple head my first kiss. Shancai, do you take this man as your husband and whether rich or poor, in sickness and in health, you will remain faithful to him? I do. I do. I don't! Let go of me! Let go! There's a lot of people on the beach. Hey, Shancai. Why are you so weird today? Am I? Have a drink. Hey. First kiss Shancai. Don't call me that. What first kiss? She and Si kissed last night. What? Shancai, is that true? I... Of course, it is. I'm sure she's been waiting so long for this. She tackled me and gave me her first kiss. Oh my god. Really? No. It was dark. I couldn't see anything. -That's why-- -You don't need to explain. I don't care who you kiss. Shancai. Shancai, wait! Wait for me! Daoming Si! You stole Shancai's first kiss, you jerk! Come out. I'm going to kill you. Stop hiding in there like a coward! Come on! Didn't you give me a joker card? I'll take the challenge now. Come out now. You're a bully. Open the door. You're trash. You're garbage! You're such a lame guy. The joker card is for Bridge. Cut out the crap. Let's start the game. Are you scared? Scared? Let's do it. If I win... -I'll admit that you're better than me. -That won't be enough. If I win, you can't stand next to Shancai anymore. Fine. -What if I win? -You can't stand next to me. Okay. This is your family's boat? Why is it so small? And why is it so shaky? It's to cut down on carbon emission. Lame people are never willing to admit how lame they are. -Are you talking about me or Shancai? -You're the same. It's fine if it's me, but if it's Shancai, I won't forgive you. But it's true. She's a girl, but she's rude and short-tempered. She dresses terribly. Most importantly, she's stupid. You don't know Shancai. You don't know how great she is. How is she great? You don't know how cute Shancai was before she came to Mingde. In high school, one time, class funds went missing. SHAME In order to find the culprit, the teacher made us stay after school. It must have been someone in this class. Does nobody want to admit to it? Fine. You're all so smart. Take out a piece of paper and write down who you think stole the money. The three classmates with the highest votes will be the culprits. Sir, you can't make us do this to our classmates. Shancai. Could it be you then? Sir, you shouldn't make us vote. Our classmates aren't thieves. We'll just find the money. Let me check your book bags! We won't. You... You... -Sir. -What? Can I go to the restroom? Shancai, you're so cool. Why are you crying? Stop crying. I think you're cool too. But this is so embarrassing. -It's not embarrassing. -I really just want to pee. From that day on, I swore that I would never let anyone pick on Shancai. Whoever picks on her, picks on me. Why does your story sound so familiar? I feel like I've heard it before. Hey. Did you steal that story from a movie? It's a real story, okay? That year, Shancai became Mrs. Chen. What? Mrs. Chen? What the hell are you talking about? In Fantasy Westward Journey. Look, this is Shancai's handle. In the game, our intimacy level has gone up to 9,999. I have a screenshot of when we got married. Are you stupid or something? You're just jealous that we're so close. What was I expecting? What's that? None of your business. What are you doing? What the hell is this? -Why is it so spicy? -It's spicy, isn't it? No. I think it's good. I think I got something. Hey. See? I told you I was a genius. I'm good at everything. It's just one catch. Are you that proud? I wasn't even trying. Hey. I clearly won. Look at my bucket. So? I won. What did we bet on? You can't stand next to me. What? You... What kind of bet is that? Do you think I'm stupid? -You are stupid. -You... You... What? Shancai is special to you, isn't she? Why do you care about her? Do you like her? I thought so when you saved her at the restaurant. To be honest, I'm kind of jealous. Because you're no longer mine. So, what are you trying to say? Do I think both of you are alike? Lei. Stop lying. You care about everyone. You try so hard to maintain the image of a princess. Even if someone gets hurt because of your indecisiveness, you don't care. I don't want to be manipulated by you anymore. Lei, that's not what I mean. You say I care about Shancai... The truth is, I only care about you. There's no need to feel sad. He's so great. He's supposed to be with Jing. But... Why do I feel so sad? Shancai, you're so cute today. When you feel like crying, do a handstand. That way, your tears won't fall down. What? Why are you like this? What should I be like? I'm forcing you, why aren't you resisting? I didn't realize that you're already a man. Now I realize it. What? -Hold this. -Why? DAO That's how you do it. Shancai? Shancai, why are you here alone? Why are your eyes red? Were you crying? No, it's just really windy here. Some sand got into my eyes. Why are you guys here? To get revenge for you, I challenged Daoming Si to squid-fishing. He lost by a lot. Look. Hey. Are you proud of being good at squid-fishing? I remember someone couldn't even get the squid off the hook. It's really hard, okay? They have so many tentacles. And they suck on to it really hard. Hey, why are you blushing? -You... -I... What's the matter with you? You pervert! You're thinking about that kiss, aren't you? It's none of your business. You can't stand next to me anymore. You're the one standing next to me. You're so petty. Dong Shancai, say something about your rude friend. Come at me then. -You... -I'm going to kill you. -Get back here. -No! Stop it. I... I'm going to get you. Even though I hate to admit it on this cold and sad night, my worst enemy brought me back to the warmth of life. Subtitle translation by Sophie
