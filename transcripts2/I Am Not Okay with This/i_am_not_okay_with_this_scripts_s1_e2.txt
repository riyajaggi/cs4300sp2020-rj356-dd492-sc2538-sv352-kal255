 Goob, trust me, Banana's proud to be a hedgehog. No question. [squeaking] [Sydney] Last night, I almost convinced myself that I cracked the wall in my bedroom without touching it. Mom says if you stare at the toaster too long, it'll never pop. But that's just what happens when you live in a shitty house with a shitty foundation. Stuff starts to crack. Yeah, well, see, what Mom doesn't know is that I can do stuff with my mind. Cool! Can I see? ♪ This time, make no mistake ♪ ♪ Keep all your secrets Locked up in your heart safe... ♪ - [Liam gasps] - [Sydney] Whoa!

Listen, I need you to do some shopping for me today 'cause we're about to run out of everything. - No thanks. - I wasn't asking. - How am I supposed to bring all this home? - However you got it home last time.

I sort of promised Brad I would go to the pep rally with him. So... But isn't the pep rally for people like... People like what, Syd? People with, you know... pep.

Are you kidding? [laughs] My dad would murder me. He doesn't even know I drive that piece of shit around. Do you even have a license? Of course I do. Okay. Let me see it. Ah, forget it. Wh... W... Ah, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's fine. It's fine. I got this. But I'm driving. Uhh... Gladys, I'm gonna take 20. Stan's car smelled like weed. Just like my dad's old truck. I'd always ask him about it when I was a kid. I'd ask why his truck smelled like skunk. Years later, I finally realized my dad was a stoner. Hey, do you, um... do you see that tower over there? It's been there since, uh... 1890-somethin'. Story goes that a hundred men died building it. There's no way it took one hundred men to build that piece of shit. Okay, well, it... it was probably more like five, but my great-great-great-granddad was one of 'em. He was not great. [sighs] Well, now that I think about it, every Barber male tends to be a shithead. So, guess it's up to me to redeem the good old family name. I've never seen your dad. Like, ever. He drives an 18-wheeler, like, 25 days a month. - Cool. - Yeah. My life is way better when he's not around. Wish he'd just stay gone, you know? And I just wish my dad was still here. Oh, I didn't... I... I didn't mean to... to, like... It doesn't bother me. Sorry, I just need to drop something off real quick. There might be more to Stanley Barber than I thought. See you next week. What are you, like a drug dealer or something? I have clients. Shit! How many? Four. Technically, one's my cousin. [chuckles] [Stanley] Just here. If you think shopping sucks, you can wait here. Turns out, there's definitely more to Stan than I thought. - I'm here to support a friend. - ♪ Chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug... ♪ I mean, he's still pretty weird, but he's also funny. I mean, not that funny. - Never mind, okay? - Okay.

Why are you still talking to me? Because everyone else in this town's boring. [chuckles] I've never smoked before. Do you wanna try? Do you... do you want me to go first? [laughs] I just had to try it. Try to numb whatever the hell's going on inside me. I just copied what he did. I didn't even cough.

[laughs] Absolutely not. - [brass band playing] - [cheerleaders] We, we want a touchdown! We, we, we want a touchdown! - Surprised you even come to this stuff. - We, we - We want a touchdown! - It's so lame. It's the opposite of lame, Syd. It's theater. It's live theater. Westinghouse Memorial High School on a Friday night. - Bring it in! - [Stanley] What could be more tragic? More Shakespearean? Think about it. The moment the lights come up on Hamlet, you know it's not gonna end well. - Take, uh... Mr. Bradley Lewis. - [whistle blows] His best case scenario is, what, managing some regional insurance sales company? Where he gets to, I don't know, call the shots on Employee of the Month? I mean, these are the people that will actually attend the five, ten, 20-year reunion, because, aside from this, nothing else all that noteworthy is gonna happen. - [yelling] - [whistle blows] This is as good as it gets for them. And I like watching 'em, like Hamlet, when everything goes to shit in the end... and everyone dies. I only wanted a boy so I could keep up with Dina, but maybe I don't have to pretend. - It's the best theater in town. - ["Little Girl" plays] - ♪ Little girl, little girl ♪ - What if I actually like Stan? ♪ What a cute little honey ♪ [crowd groans] - Ooh.
