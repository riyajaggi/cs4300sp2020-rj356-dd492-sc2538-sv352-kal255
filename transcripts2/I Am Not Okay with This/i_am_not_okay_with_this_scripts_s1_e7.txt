 [heartbeat] [high-pitched ringing] [Syd] Dear Missing Diary, so... my dad was just like me, and it destroyed him. I guess I've got a choice to make. Either I lock myself away from the world and just disappear, let this stuff just destroy me too, or I could... ♪ Sunshine ♪

 Well, I mean, it still kinda hurts, but lucky for you, Veronica Thompson has a thing for tough guys. She gave me a sticker. [chuckles] Nice one, Goob. I'm never washing these pajamas. Also, made you lunch. Cut the crusts off the sandwich. Just wanted to let you know I care. [chuckles] Are you okay? Paint me yellow and call me fucking sunshine, Goob. ♪ Eeh by gum, it's the Sunshine Superman ♪ I think the key is when I start to feel upset, to just decide to give less of a fuck. The less of a fuck I give, the less likely I am to break shit. Stay positive, Syd. Problem solved. - [whistle blows] - [shouting] [woman] Take five, ladies. [girl] I guess we got three more miles. So much. - Why'd she make us run so much? - [sighs] Let's sprint... I don't think I've ever seen you run that hard. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen you run. Oh, God, it's the worst. [sighs] [man] Scotty, you're in! Look, about the whole library situation... I shouldn't have asked you to help me steal anything, Dina. It was stupid. Truth is, and I... I know this is gonna sound crazy, but... [sighs]...I sort of had this, like... hallucination. - Shit. - Or something, I don't know. I was... just freaked out. I mean, this is exactly the kind of crazy shit you should be telling me, Syd. That's what I'm here for. I don't get it. I used to know everything about you. I even knew what you had for lunch. [chuckles] Now it's just, like, nothing. Well, I guess I should tell you... Today... I had an apple and some peanut butter and chocolate milk and, like, three cartons of Nerds. - [laughing] - [boy] Ahem. Uh, Dina... Uh, yeah. I was thinking, since you and Brad are, like, whatever, and the big dance is tonight, maybe we could... Oh, I've decided to kind of just lay low this year. Cool. No worries. [sighs] That's, like, the third person that's asked me today. I mean, I'm flattered, but, oh, my God, I am so over guys right now. [laughs] Yeah, me too. What about Stan? Stan and I, we're just... better off as friends. You know, if he ever decides to talk to me again. You guys aren't going to homecoming together anymore? Well... any chance you might, uh... wanna go with me? Unless homecoming's for people like... People like what? People with... pep. Well, I'm pep as fuck today, Dina. - Let's do it! - [laughs] [whistle blows] Wait, we're not dressing up, are we? You better bring it, Syd.

Is that what this is? [laughs] [belches] Aah! [laughs] [coughs] [Brad's friend] Dude, we crushed that game. We lost by 28 points. Still. So, what do you wanna do? Let's just say that tonight's gonna be fuckin' mind-blowing. [laughs] Okay. [sighs] [Maggie] Wow! Syd. A dress. [chuckles] - Can you help me with the... - Yeah. Yeah. ...with the buttons in the back? You know, the first time your dad and I kissed was at a school dance. - Dad! At a dance? - [chuckles] I know, it's hard to imagine, but your dad actually had some moves. It was my sophomore year, and I... I went with this senior, Charlie Murray. His hair did this amazing swoop thing. I'm pretty sure he used a lot of hair spray. Wow, please tell me this ends in Dad punching this guy in the face. Oh, not quite. You see, I... I didn't know any of Charlie's friends, and they thought I was just some dumb sophomore, so he ditched me to hang out with them. And your dad... he saw me just standing there all alone, and he came over, and he asked me to dance. Before I said yes, we just looked at each other and somehow, we knew. All done. You look beautiful. Thanks. I've been such a dick. Yes, you have. [laughs] It's just... I miss him. Yeah. Me too. [doorbell rings] Oh, hey, D. Syd'll be a minute, but, uh, you can come inside. Have a seat. Okay. Can I get you somethin'? Some tea, some coffee? It's French roast. Checkin' out my face, huh, D? Pretty cool, right? You should see the other guy. Syd, you... I brought it, right? Yeah. Big time. [chuckles] All right, you two, remember. No smoking, no drinking, be home by eight o'clock. It's 7:45. And most importantly, Syd... Yeah, Goob?

[feedback] You know, it's... it's funny, because everyone is so fast to call me an asshole, but while I was downstairs banging Jenny Tuffield at Ricky's... [crowd gasping] ...guess what Sydney was doing upstairs. She was kissing my girlfriend. [crowd murmurs] Now, don't get me wrong, chicks get drunk, they make out sometimes, and I'm all for it, but... being a full-on dyke, that's a whole other ball game. I mean, Syd is fucking in love with Dina. Page after page, it's absolutely pathetic. Oh, shut up, Brad. And, my God, don't even get me started with the daddy issues on this one. Everyone in her life thinks that she's a piece of shit. And I mean everyone. - [laughs] Ooh-hoo! - Hey, man! Leave her alone! - [grunts] - [crowd gasps] But that is not even the weirdest thing about Sydney... [Syd] Shut up! ...Novak. [screams] Fuck! Shut up. Just shut up.
