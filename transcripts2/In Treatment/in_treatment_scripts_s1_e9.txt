 Previously on In Treatment... - She went to finalize the abortion. - I don't know if I want another baby. I don't think the issue is as clear-cut as both of you... You're talking to two people who spent 5 years in fertility treatments. It seems to me that you're not really talking about a child. You're really talking about your inability to accept each other. You haven't helped us to decide whether to abort or not, but you've done a great job getting us to fight. Yes to the pregnancy or no? To have an abortion or not? Just fucking say it already. - You want me to give you an answer now? - Yes. I want a yes or a no. I think you should have an abortion.

 Sloan, for my grandfather. Don't start with family names. Remember my grandfather's name? Otis... Otis... Behave. You're on probation. It's gone. It is? The problem is, now I've got it. - What? - Pain. - Your stomach hurts? - I don't know. Feel for yourself. It's not exactly my stomach, but... - What then? - Somewhere like... Maybe it's in my pancreas or something, maybe. - Near your spleen? - Yeah, it's in that general vicinity. Transcript: FRM. Sync: Gaillots, michvanilly. Jake and Amy Week two (1x09) I didn't keep the appointment with Dr. Kornreich. I decided to wait. I mean, you said last time that I decided without thinking it over. So now I'm thinking it over. And when we left here last time, Jake didn't say a word about it. Even later, we didn't talk about it. And that night we went to bed for the first time in a long without fighting. We were watching tv and I said, "I don't think this pregnancy's worth fighting over." And I said, "I think I might want this baby." Then I said, "think about it some more "because I pity a child born to a mother who doesn't want him." And I said, "I just said I think I might want this baby." And that was it. And we laughed. And I woke up the next morning... It was late, actually. He'd left for work already and taken Lenny to school. And I just decided to take the day off. I was just lying in bed thinking and I was enjoying myself, enjoying my thoughts. I thought about giving birth. And for the first time I wondered whether it was a boy or a girl. And I just somehow knew that it's a girl. and I could imagine Lenny pushing some kid who tried to take her bike. It was sweet. Violence turns her on. And then I got dressed and the waistband in my pants was a little tight, which I didn't love, but I didn't get upset about it. So you haven't seen Dr. Kornreich since? And I assume you've discussed this? Well, not really. Jake asked what happened at the doctor's I said I didn't go and that was it. We didn't talk about it anymore. I mean, we have time, you know? So what do you think? Well, first of all I'm really glad that you came back. You both seem much more relaxed than... than last week. and since a week has gone by, you actually have less time to decide. But that doesn't... It doesn't seem to be bothering either of you. Less time? What... Are you pressuring me now? I mean, we have at least two weeks. I don't know, I... I think we've said everything that we need to say. I think what Amy's trying to say is this is gonna be our last session. No, not necessarily. I... I just think - we shouldn't talk about it so much. - He'll get over it, believe me. No, but let's hear Paul out. - But we talked about it. - But let's just hear what he says. Yes, but we decided. I think it's too soon. Told you. Both of you now have more than one opinion about the pregnancy. It's not so black and white as it... as it was last week. And... I think that's got a little to do with you both coming here. What do you think, Amy? Maybe. I mean... I still want my career. I don't want to give it up. I just feel like I might be able to manage everything. I don't know. I'm young enough and the world's full of working mothers. And maybe I'll just take on less clients. I just... I don't know if I'd ever be able to get pregnant again. And I really don't want to do something that I'd regret later. I think I can handle it, especially when I think of what a younger brother or sister? would do for Lenny. I just... I'm not saying it's final, I just want to think about it and I will make a decision soon. I just... I don't want... Sorry. Amy? Baby? What's happening? Let me in. Amy, let me in. Kate! Kate! Kate, can you come here a minute? What is it? How do I get this bloodstain out of the sofa? - What do you mean blood? - Blood. How do I get it out? What happened? The couple who were here... She's... She's pregnant. What, she had a miscarriage? No, she was... She was sitting here, She got this pain. She went to the bathroom, she came back. - And there was this blood. - Are you okay? - You look a little pale. - No, I'm... I'm fine, I'm just... It's blood, it's... For God's sakes, Paul, don't. - I'll take care of it. Don't touch it. - But I don't want it to dry okay? I know. just don't touch it, all right? Fuck. This shampoo gets out bloodstains, but, - How do you know these things? - You've forgotten how much I know. I'm going to try hydrogen peroxide first. Hydrogen peroxide. That poor woman. What week was she in? I don't know... Seventh, eighth. Did anything happen? Did anything happen during the session? A fairly normal session. They've been trying to get pregnant forever. Are you sure that's not gonna leave a stain? Well... When's your next session? It's gonna have to dry. Everyone who comes in is gonna say "What is it?" You have no idea how sensitive some of my patients can be. Right, your patients are sensitive. Not you. You're right. You're right. Okay, well... We'll have to see after it dries. - I'll clean up here for you meanwhile. - No no, it's okay. Leave it. It's fine. Thanks for doing that anyway. Well, maybe now you'll agree to replace this filthy old couch. You know, you could make this room a bit more pleasant in general. Why are you so concerned about this room? I thought you hated it. I don't hate this room. I'm just still jealous of it. Come on. I'll make you some tea before the next session. I suppose not everything that happens in here is as dramatic as this, right? No, it isn't, Kate. It's just an office. Really. Come on, let's go. You know, Paul... You call me down here for all your little emergencies, for your toilet and your sofa, but you can't wait to get me out of here. Kate, do me a favor. What do you want from me? Nothing. I'm tired. I'm tired. That's all. It's not big deal. I... I went back to see Gina. Gina? When? Last week. I just felt I needed somebody to talk to, you know? - What, to Gina? - Yes, Gina. I don't understand. I thought you despised that woman. Aren't you exaggerating just a little bit? "That woman"? Me? With all the crap she wrote about you. I thought... Well, I had to talk to somebody. I can't talk to you about... No, of course you can't talk to me. You know what I mean, Kate. It's easier for me to talk to Gina than to somebody who... Who doesn't know me. Gina. Jesus. Why is Gina such a threat to you, Kate? Tell me. Don't talk to me like one of your patients. You want me out? Fine. But don't talk to me in that condescending psychological tone because I can't bear it. Jesus Christ. Can I do anything right? What? I'm sorry, is that supposed to be me? Because you're the one walking around this house like me and the kids are invisible! Because I don't want Max to go to a school for "gifted" children means I don't see him? No, Paul, you're not seeing what he's going through. And what is he going through, Kate? Don't you hear the way he talks about school? Don't you see that he has no friends? No! You're off in your own little world, but I'm the one left dealing with this house. And if I've raised your children till now... Sorry, what do you mean, "raised my children"? What's that supposed to mean, you raised my children? Don't you see that he's home all day? That he never goes to friends', that no one ever comes to see him? Doesn't that worry you? So how did you decide ?he's not having a good time at school? I didn't decide. He told me. And you, you're so confident... you're so definite telling me, you know, that he's not going to a class for gifted children. What the hell do you know about what he needs or doesn't need? Paul, he has no friends! None! He says he's only willing to hang out with Malcolm. Malcolm. I asked him if he goes outside during recess and he said that he hardly does except maybe with Malcolm, his one barely friend. I asked him, "all right, so, sweetheart, how do you feel about school in general?" And he says he hates school. Every kid hates school. He's bored with school, Paul. He's bored. - He hates his teachers. - All his teachers he's hates? Yes, Paul, all of his teachers. They're all stupid to him and he's bored with all of them and he hates all of them. And then after he tells me this, You know what the most important thing he had to tell me was? What? That I shouldn't tell you. Your son has no friends, he hates his school, but the most important thing is that I not tell you. Because in your own warped way, Paul, you've made him understand that it's not as important as what happens here. Just like you've done to me. You know... For a long time, you've not made me feel like I was the most important thing to you. Not me, not the kids, not compared to what happens in here. Is that it? Tell me when did you become such an asshole. I sit in this house and I say "Goddamn it. "What is this punishment?" You are so impatient with the kids And it pisses me off, it pisses me off that you are energetic and alive in this room and you're an old man at home. You're an old, anemic man, Paul! You're always tired! You're always tired for us. Okay. Maybe I haven't noticed. Maybe things have gotten worse for Max. I'll talk to him. Okay? So how's Rosie? How's she? How's she doing? Rosie, yeah, she's fine, why? I was just thinking about that thing at the youth center. You really think Rosie can help recovering drug addicts? I mean... We don't even know what she does there. We don't even know who she sees there. Why don't you ask her? You could try talking to her. She would... She would like that. She needs that. Are you saying now that I don't talk to Rosie? First, I don't talk to Max. Now I don't talk to Rosie. Is that what you're saying? I walk around the house like a blind man? Do I disgust you? 'cause that's what it feels like. It feels like I disgust you. Don't be ridiculous, of course you don't. What are you talking about? Why don't we ever talk? We never talk. I don't understand that. Okay. We've got a few minutes, let's... Let's talk. Okay. I'm seeing someone. - What do you mean, you're... - What do you think I mean? Who is he? Someone I'm seeing. Who the fuck is he?! - What difference does it make? - Don't tell me that!  Who the fuck is he? - He's divorced, he has a son. - Divorced. - He's 40 years old. - 40! At least you can't say he's an anemic old man. - He runs an employment agency. - Manages an employment agency. - Where do you meet this guy? - What difference does it make? Don't keep saying to me what difference does it make! Where the fuck do you meet him?! At his place. At his place. What do you do at his place? Come on. No, come on. I want to know. You meet him at his place and what do you do? Use your imagination, Paul. Tell me yourself, you fucking liar! You've been lying to me, what is it? Two months, six months, a year? I want to know what you do when you meet this guy. - Stop it, just... - I want to understand what it is that you do when you go to his place. I want detail! I don't wanna be left sitting alone to imagine what it's like. - You fucking tell me. - What do you want to hear? He leaves work, I meet at his place. And it doesn't take us more than an hour. Is that what you wanted to hear? He moves differently. He does everything differently and that is what made it so exciting. Is that what you want to hear? And that I can't stop thinking about the way he looks at me or the way he touches me. He knows I'm married and that's what turns him on. Is that what you wanted to hear? You know what amazes me? What really gets me is that you can go to this guy's place and then you can come home here all wet and flushed and excited and horny and you can sit down with our son and do his homework. How does that make you feel? I just want to know how does that make you feel? It makes me feel like shit. And a week later I go back? and I do it all over again. I hope that's not too complicated for you to understand, Paul. Happens every day, doesn't it? You know, you... You know, you have the gall to accuse me of neglect, of letting you down, of letting down our kids, our family. Whatever I did, whatever I did, it was not intentional. But what you did was deliberate. You made a choice... A deliberate choice to betray me... ... and our kids. Congratulations. You've made sure to ruin any chance of saving this marriage. Me ruin it? Oh, it was ruined already. What... what I haven't been able to understand... Is how you have not been able to see that. And what's hurt me the most is that you haven't had a fucking clue. You so didn't suspect anything... Because it never even crossed your fucking preoccupied mind that I could do anything like this. Is it over? Are you gonna keep on seeing him? It's up to you. Please leave. Hello. I dreamt about Becca again. - Same dream? - Yeah. I'm in a boat. she's in the water, I see her drowning. I say to myself, "just... just jump in. "Save her." Something's holding me back.
