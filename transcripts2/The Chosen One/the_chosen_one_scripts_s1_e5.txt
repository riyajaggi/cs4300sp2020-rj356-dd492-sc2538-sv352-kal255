 Next. Hello. - Do you speak Portuguese? - Just enough not to starve. What's the purpose of your stay? Bird-watching in the Pantanal. I love nature. And how long will you be staying? Ten days, then I'm spending an additional five days in São Paulo. Enjoy the Pantanal. A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Hello. How are you?

 Now we're doing great. Gather everyone for the ceremony. We're about to begin. Hey, man. Don't screw us even more. The pulse is weak. What are you doing, dummy? I'm not missing the chance to take samples of this water. Don't you understand how serious this is, you animal? And all because of you. If it were up to you, we'd still be freezing in there. Besides, there's nothing left to do. Come on, let's go. I can't just leave him here to die. Nobody will thank you for this.

 We're doctors, damn it! Right. As a doctor, without the possibility of proper care, I'd say nothing can be done. We have to get Lúcia. Or is she already dead, doctor? Look, don't treat me like a criminal, okay? And since you're so righteous, Damião, tell me, what can we do against these savages? Stick a rifle in their faces? No. Why use rifles when we can smash bottles over their heads? All I'm saying is that we can call the police once we're out of here! - You want to escape through the jungle? - There's no other way. The boat is at the campsite. No, no. - No way. We'll get caught again. - Have you suddenly gone stupid? I don't want to go back there. But the only way out of here is by boat. Maybe he's worth something, right? He's the only thing we have to negotiate with. What do you want me to do? Help me. Come on, help me, damn it! Fuck. Fuck. What are you doing to me? Silence. You can't... You don't even know my blood type. Yes, I can. - Will you stop that? - Chosen One? Help me, please! Help me, please! Listen to me. Please, listen to me. I understood. I've understood everything. Please. Tell him I've understood. I understood. I'm understanding everything now. Please. Tell him I understood! Please! I understand now, I do. Fanatics! Motherfuckers! I understand. I understand now, that I don't need to try to understand. I simply understand. I know. You stopped understanding with your mind. Your spirit now commands your body. Yes. Now you are like us. Doctor. Get her out of here, doctor. Can't you see I'm unwell? - Out! - No. - Chosen One. - Get out. What are you doing with her? No! My Chosen One... You are full of life, Lúcia. - What's up with you? - What are you doing with that woman? You should be at the ceremony, Angelina. - Santiago and the rest are already there. - No. The Chosen One needs me. My place is here. You have to rest. You're sick. - But, doctor... - Worry about yourself, girl! You can't serve him this way. I don't want to see you die. No. The Chosen One wouldn't allow that. He loves me. The Chosen One can't heal you, Angelina. You know that. Now go to the ceremony. You don't want Santiago to notice you're not there. Do you? Go. Please. Angelina. Angelina, come here. What's going on? I can't talk to you, Mateus. - The Chosen One... - What's up with the doctor? Angelina, I'm not a stranger. I can't talk to you. My brother has been interpreting the signs wrong, Angelina. You can see that, too. The doctors... The doctors have to go. You know that, don't you? The Chosen One is who should know. I only follow his word. Okay, then... Follow your instincts here. What is your spirit telling you? I'm worried about what could happen to Mateus. We still haven't heard anything about him. And what can we do, Zulmira? We should ask for mercy for him, just like he always does for us. Mateus is our leader. The Chosen One took him. He's deciding on Mateus's punishment. Are you sure about that, Vicente? Did he tell you that? No. I know Santiago has something to do with all this. Santiago is jealous of Mateus, he's jealous of Mateus's role here. He's jealous of the love The Chosen One has for him. Mateus has always been a loyal servant. Not when it comes to you. Don't you dare say that again, Vicente! That is between me and my husband! You're wrong, Zulmira. Mateus betrayed the trust of the entire village. Are you blind? Santiago isn't jealous of his brother. That's absurd. Anyway, isn't the doctor The Chosen One's messenger? Didn't Mateus give in to what he asked us to reject? That's how it is? That's how you thank him for everything he's done for you? I follow The Chosen One, not Mateus. You're the only man in this village without a mission, Vicente. You're The Chosen One's least favorite child. And now we know why. The Chosen One is punishing Mateus to teach him a lesson before you. You should be more grateful. I say, we wait for The Chosen One's decision. If Mateus returns, we'll thank God. But if The Chosen One decides otherwise, we thank him anyway. - This isn't gonna work. - Still better than your plan. - This isn't even a plan. - And it's still better than yours. Damião, do you really want to negotiate with savages? They're not savages. They're... weird. But they have their laws. If they believe that we respect this man's life, they won't feel threatened. They won't see us as the enemy. I can even believe that they have laws. But these laws are based on fanaticism and irrational religious beliefs. - And they don't apply to outsiders. - It doesn't matter! This is what we're doing. For Lúcia. All right. All right. Keep an eye on him. Brother... Brother. You can't keep ignoring me, brother. For our mother's sake... You ignored me. All I've done is to protect you my entire life. But I know I've betrayed your trust. Even though I've lived to serve you all these years... I betrayed your trust. You sinned in front of your wife. I was drunk, brother. I'm just a man. You are my voice. And I don't hear my word on your tongue anymore, Mateus. After being marked with The Chosen One's symbol, you can never go back to Aguazul alone. You will serve our holy healer until he releases you from that mission. Santiago. No. Don't do anything you might regret. Is that Flavio's rifle? Where is he? I came in peace, Santiago. I just want you to listen to me. How did you get out of the well? What did you do to Flavio? He's been hurt. - It's serious, but it was an accident. - Accident... Listen, damn it. I don't want him to die, Santiago. I want to take him to The Chosen One. You soil us with your lies once again! I could've run and left him for dead. But, no. I left him in my colleague's care and came here, alone, to get you. Think about it. I could have left him in agony. I wouldn't even need to shoot him. So, if you hurt me in any way, he'll die and you won't know where he is. Bastard. What do you want? To make peace with The Chosen One. Let's see how this works. Damião? Damião, is that you? Zulmira? Zulmira! Zulmira. What do you want, Silvino? Can't you stop bringing strangers to Aguazul? She's my wife. Ger her out of here now. Silvino, you're not getting what you want. And your wife will die in these conditions. No. I'm holding you to your word. She needs to be healed by The Chosen One. Or would you rather watch her die? You came at the worst time possible, Silvino. I helped you when no one else would, Zulmira. My wife's life is in your hands. Where's Flavio? I swear... - I swear... - Don't swear! Best if you don't swear. Or I'll make you choose between the rifle and the knife. Enzo! Enzo, come out! We're all good. He's dead. You've killed him, you bastard. Look at all this blood! You killed a pure man. A man with no sin. A man much better than you! The Chosen One. We can... He doesn't bring people back from the dead, you moron! I should kill you right now! But you did something you don't understand. Only The Chosen One is able to judge you. He was alive! I swear that he was alive! There must be an explanation. He must have hit his head on the rock. I told you not to swear. Didn't I? I won't kill you now. But I'll keep my promise... since you didn't keep yours. The rifle or the knife? Go look for the other doctor. We'll take Flavio and this one. ...the natives. The outside doctor, nothing destroyed him. They actually helped him. Woke him up. Old nag. You need to make a decision. We need to go to the camp and bring death to him. Hi. Can I help you, ma'am? Or maybe... can you help me get out of this jungle? You know it won't work, Silvino. It doesn't matter if the request comes from someone we know as well as you. For more than 20 years, my mother took me... to see The Chosen One. It was right after he cured the jaguar. He was just a child, and I had polio. Even so, The Chosen One cured me. Me. Me, an outsider. That was a long time ago, Silvino. Right after that, the catastrophe happened. The blood tears. If he sees her state, he'll show mercy. The Chosen One is a good man. Good. He comes to the village, doesn't he? So, I can wait for him. Right? The Celebration of Death already happened. He won't be back here anytime soon. But if he sees her condition, he'll have mercy and heal her. He's a good man. I saw his eyes when he was healing me. He's a good man. A saint. Even with all the selfishness of his brothers. I'm sorry, Zulmira. I know Mateus is your husband, but I know him. You know what Mateus and Santiago are like. And you're a good woman, Zulmira. Blessed. Help me get this blessing, for the love of God. I can't. I can't, Silvino. What's up, Zulmira? This fisherman wants to see his wife die. Please, Zulmira. This can be our secret. Please. Let's go, man. You're sentencing my wife to death, Zulmira. You're the one killing her. This will weigh on your conscience forever! You and this damn village are killing her! There's nothing we can do for him, Zulmira. We're not God. You shouldn't have given him hope. The Chosen One has cured outsiders, Vicente. - Maybe, if we... - Have you forgotten about Sinhozinho? And the magnitude of the serpent's power? Careful of your actions, Zulmira. A traitor's wife might be a traitor herself. My tears will run, Mateus. I can feel it. We've been loyal all these years, brother. God won't let a catastrophe like that happen to us. These will be different. They'll mark the end of an era. What do you mean? Only the doctor knows. No, no. Lúcia doesn't know anything. I'm not the one who doesn't trust you anymore, Mateus. - You're the one who's lost faith in me. - No, brother. Never. You chose to serve me, brother. I'm telling you, you can leave me. But I didn't choose this. My human body suffers with the pain of my power every day. Don't bring more sadness to my spirit. You are my only truth, brother. The doctor is the messenger. Lúcia is my message. If you don't believe that, you don't believe me. No. No. I have to protect you, even if you think I'm acting against your will. That's why I can't free you from your penitence. Angelina? - What did they do to me? - Don't talk. - I don't think I can walk. - You'll have to make an effort. I'm so weak. Can I lean on you? - Thank you. - You don't have to thank me. I'm only doing what I should've done a long time ago. The doctor can leave if she wants, Mateus. But she'll stay. But it won't be for you. I've always been faithful to the wife you gave me. I've learned my lesson. I'll fight to be the decent man you always believed I could be. I mean it. You can release me. What about the other doctors? They passed the blue water test, Mateus. Don't worry about them. Chosen One! They killed Flavio! They killed Flavio on your sacred ground, Chosen One! My God... On your knees! May the last thing you ever see be your crime, sinner! No, brother! You can't do this. How can you still defend these murderers?! You can't possibly have such a soft heart! They locked me in a cabin with a jaguar, strung me up to feed to the alligators and threw us into a well with that blue water The Chosen One uses for his healing tricks. And all this in two or three days. - I told you... - Yeah. These people are sick. You're not a fan either, huh? What'd they do to you? They killed my son. The Chosen One brought death to my boy. He was a pure child, full of life like The Chosen One. But one had to be blessed... and the other one cursed. Your son died during one of the supposed cures? The damned Virgin and The Chosen One killed my son because they wanted to. - He's here. Behind the tree. - What are you doing? - I thought you were against them. - But I'm not for you either. Silvino. - Silvino. Where did you take your wife? - Don't try to help me, Father. - You know I don't believe in your prayers. - She's in agony, Silvino. Where did you take her? You took her out of town. You know where I went, Father. - You know. - The healer? You still believe in that healer, Silvino? That's all in the past! He's either dead or hiding in the jungle. Listen, Silvino. The next time you risk your wife's life like this, I'll have to call the police. I found him, Father. He's healing again. It must be a mistake. He can't be healing again. He can't. You have to understand, Silvino, that's a sin. I saw it. He cured the natives. He can cure heathens. When, Silvino? - Not long ago. - But... And Mateus? And Santiago? They made a promise. They wouldn't let... Father, you know this is true. It's for real! Look! We have to go to the papers. We have to tell the world. Those people have to share their blessing. What are you doing? Bastard! Why did you do this? Forgive me, Silvino. But that picture can't exist. It can't. Trust me. For everyone's sake. Forget the healer. Forget Aguazul. Just like they forgot about us. That man is insane. Sick. He's not a saint, Angelina. I don't know what he is, but I know he's not a saint. I don't know what he is. Only Dr. Lorenzo knows more about him. I'm telling you, he's sick. Mentally ill. He kept repeating that I was his life. His life. That doesn't make sense. His life? Yes. What is it? What happened? Come with me, doctor. We don't have much time. Congratulations. You always make the best decisions. It was an accident. I heard people coming and tried to move him. I panicked. How could you let him die, Enzo? It wasn't on purpose, Damião. The guy hit his head on a rock, damn it. You know what's going to happen to us now, don't you? But... weren't they supposed to be civilized? Not with murder. One man killing another... on the holy soil of this campsite... is the biggest offense anyone could make against God. No one has died in these lands by another person's hands since we've been isolated, until today. You've soiled our sacred place. Chosen One... Your pleas are inappropriate now. But you have to understand that we didn't mean to. I'm a doctor, damn it. I wouldn't just kill that man. It was in self-defense, I swear. Don't interrupt the holy Chosen One. You'll have the chance to cleanse your souls and look up at the sky again, doctors. I'll give you that chance at the appropriate time. If there is one. Brother... this is why we have renounced the outside world. The plague has reached me... despite all our efforts. And we have to exterminate it. It's time for the Trial of the Sorrow. Brother? Are you okay? It's nothing, dear brother. Lúcia. She had nothing to do with this. Don't tell me what I already know. Lúcia isn't like you. She was sent to me. Do you still defend the absurd? He will never let you out of the cage. I'm trying to help you, but you keep making things worse. You don't get it, do you? Do you think he'll be able to hide forever? We've been doing this for years. They're not the first outsiders to try to destroy our balance. But we were always stronger because we fought together. - And that strength is being broken. - You're only thinking about the village. The Chosen One is talking about blood tears. He said that Lúcia will give him a message about his tears. We have to get them out of here. I thought you'd say you wanted that doctor to stay, so you could be with her. I wouldn't agree, but I'd understand. But you're saying you want them to leave, after everything you've seen. That's stupidity, Mateus. She took Lúcia! Angelina took Lúcia! Find her now! Let's go, let's go! - What's that? - A cemetery. I know that. But a cemetery for whom? - Aguazul. - For the villagers who ask to die? For them, too. And everyone in Aguazul who will one day ask for death. They dig their own graves. It's a way to get ready. You're not the woman you used to be. Now you are my life. What are you afraid of? You're the most important person in the world to me now. And you need to be treated with the importance that you deserve. Would you like that? Do you promise loyalty? My Angelina... Yes. I promise... my Chosen One. Now what? Where are we? - We're too far from the river. - I know. I wanted to show you something first. Not that way, doctor. Why not? - You're offending the graves. - Graves? Graves without crosses or markers. Without visits, ceremonies or tears. But who are these people? Me. You? What do you mean? Why'd you bring me here? The Chosen One demands loyalty, especially from his life. Doctor, are you willing to disappear from the world? To give up your name? To forget who you are and how you got here? He steals your blood, too. Believe me, doctor, I wanted to save you. I did. Angelina... But after what you told me, I realize that I can't. My God, this man brainwashed you. He won't stop thinking of you, desiring you, desiring your blood until you die! I am The Chosen One's life! I am! God chose me! He chose me! And I'm not dead yet! But you will be. Angelina, stop it!
