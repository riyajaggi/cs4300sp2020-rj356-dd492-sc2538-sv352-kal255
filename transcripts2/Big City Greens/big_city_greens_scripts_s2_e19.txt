 Oh, yeah, "games." Like potato peeler over here? Drop and peel me 50. Did enough of that in the war. Get me when it's time to leave. Want to find a game to play together, Papa? Sure thing, sweetie. What game should we play first? Ah, ah, ah, your grandmother is still expecting a call from you, birthday boy. But that'll cut into my Cricket time. Don't worry, buddy. I need to go drop off your present anyway. Master Cricket, have you brought a gift for Master Remy? Of course. One best present for one best friend. Bouncy ball.

 Hmm. Very good. I'll put it with the others. Whoa! Those are Remy's other gifts? Yes, Master Remy always receives the most lavish of gifts. Vasquez, I found Remy the biggest and bounciest ball in all of Big City. Wowee-zowee! Would you look at all the presents. Which one's yours, Cricket? It's, uh, the good one? Oh, Cricket, you old bean. Hey, Remy. You finally going to win that big prize this year? I wish. Uh, what big prize? You mean you never heard of the coolest, most bestest prize at Snuggly Pete's? Were you born in a dumb-dumb hole? They're talking about the top prize at the prize booth. Big Rex. A 10,000-ticket prize. But no kid has ever won 10,000 tickets. I'm just here to have a good time. Even if he's got the cutest little sunglasses that he couldn't have possibly put on himself. I mean, look at those arms. Don't you worry, little Remy. I will win those 10,000 tickets to get you the birthday present you deserve. Why'd I let myself get dragged into this madhouse? - Please, can somebody help me? - Huh? My youngest, Bryan, he hasn't come out of the playtubes yet. He must've gotten lost. Lost, lost... Sammy never made it back, Alice. He's done for. I ain't leaving him in there. We got a code, soldier! Never leave a man behind. I'll find your boy, Miss, hopefully in one piece. Please, hurry. He's got an orthodontist appointment in an hour. Wow, what game should we play first? There's Skee-Ball, air hockey, Snee-pordee. What about this game, Papa? This is adorable. I was born just so I could meet you. Ha-ha, holy Whack-a-Moley. Your old man is great at this... game? I found you. I found you. Oh, you found me. Hmm. Ha-ha, this is so much more fun than tangoing by myself like I do at home. - Ah! - Yeah, yeah, fun game. How many tickets did we get? Cricket, Tango Tango Double Luxe Ultra is just a game for fun. We don't get any tickets. Huh? Well, forget this game. What else do you want to do, Remy? How about the... Kawaii photo booth? Mm-hmm. And how many tickets does that one give? None. Just wonderful Kawaii memories. Right. Hmm. Remy, what's a better memory than cramming in as many games as possible before gift time? Well... okay, let's do it. Ah, it's like a jungle in this jungle gym. You seen a kid named Bryan? B-B-Bryan? Yeah. I saw Bryan in No-Kid's-Land. But you don't want to go there. Someone ate too much pizza and, you know. I can't go back in there! Don't make me go back in there! At ease, soldier. Your tour is over. Time to bring Bryan home. Now what game will give us the most tickets? - Uh, I mean fun? - Ooh, how about... - Over here. - Oh, okay! Oh, yes. Next game! - Next game! - Oh, okay. Next game! Faster, Remy, faster. I just need a second. Wow, we're really blasting through these games. Ha! Yup, and we still got a bunch more to get through, so hurry up and throw a Skee-Ball. All right, this is the last of Remy's gifts. Ready to gather everyone up for cake and presents? I think it's time. But I still need more tickets. Huh? What'd you say, buddy? I said, uh, why don't we help that ball along a bit? But doesn't cheating take the fun out of it? - Oh, I'm having a blast. - Whoo-hoo! Oh, look at us. I'll remember this day for as long as we're friends. You mean forever? Oh! Peek-a-boo. Peek-a-boo. - Uh... - Peek-a-boo. Sweetie, you're very cute, but that's not the way you play Holy Whack-a-Moley. Let Papa show you how it's done. Okay. This'll teach you for ruining my garden. Papa, what's gotten into you? Nothing, I'm just whacking the moles. You see, moles are pests, and pests deserve a good bonkin' on the noggin. Hyah! Pow! Hyah! Who are you? How many tickets did I get? Come on, come on. All right, let's see how you did. One? That's it? I'm not a fast mouse, Cricket. Come on, Remy. Hurry up, hurry up. We can hit up a dozen more games before you open presents and... Whoa. Here, why don't you take a little break on the pony. And I'll just keep getting tickets without you. See you at present time, buddy. Cricket! Don't go... without me. Where is that kid? Bryan? Is that you? What do you want from me? Easy, boy. I'm here to hel... Aah! Come with me, kid. I'm going to get you back to you mama. You're going to take me back? Well, I'm not going back! Outside, I'm just a regular kid. But in the jungly gym, I'm king! What are you...? Why are you like this? Huh? Hmm. Baby, why'd you unplug Papa's moles? Moles are beautiful creatures and deserve respect. Sweetie, you do not want to get between a farmer and an invasive species. Hey, Tilly, got any spare tickets? - I really need to... - Not now, Cricket. Papa and I are having a discussion. Like I said, moles are the farmer's enemy. So Papa's going to go back to hitting the moles very hard. Would you hit me if I was a mole, Papa? - Tickets? - Well, if you were a mole, you wouldn't be my daughter, so, yes. Every time they unplug the game and plug it back in, tickets come out. Attention, friends of Remy. Please gather at the gift table for birthday cake and presents. That's a ten-hut on the double, kids! Oh, dang. Okay, I don't have much time, but I think I've got a plan. Hmm. Oh, Tilly. Mr. Green. Do you know where Cricket is? I do not. I have been busy saving moles from a certain whack-a-maniac. Oh. Where could Cricket be? You can do this. Just put on your mask, Jimmy. They can't see your tears behind the mask. Ow. All right, just got to find the main power switch and... Ah. Resetting all the games will get me enough tickets to get my best bud the best present. Huh? Oh, boy. A whole pizza just for Benny. Whoa! Curse my gluttony. You're coming with me. Never! - Huh? - Sorry, son. I never leave a man behind. Perfect. Now I just got to hurry and collect my tickets. All right, everyone, huddle up. Let us sing to my birthday boy. And here we go. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Hello, come to claim a... prize? Is this enough for the T. rex? Hmm, let me count them real quick. One, two... Wow. Ten thousand exactly. Here's your prize, kid. Hang on, Remy. Cricket's a'coming. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ And many more! Whoa, slow down. It's a wet floor! Huh? Whoa! Ah! Uh, happy birthday? Hey, you okay, buddy? Listen, I know it got all wet and smooshed, but, I mean, cake is cake. Plus, I got you that T. rex you like. Cricket, I don't care about the cake or the T. rex. I get cool presents every year. This was the first birthday party I've been able to share with a best friend. All I wanted was to spend time with you. That means I really blew it by ditching you to go ticket-hunting all day, huh? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Well, there's still some party time left. Why don't we spend the rest of the party doing what you want to do? You mean it? Even the Kawaii photo booth? Of course we're going to do the Koala photo booth. Wow, they really talked it out. You know, we could learn from that. How about we play a different game, like air hockey? Good thinking, Papa. Pucks deserve to be hit. - No! - Yes! Thank you so much, intense old lady, for getting my boy. It was an honor, ma'am. Now let's get you to the orthodontist, Bryan. Well, back to hating kids. - Oh! - Put the ears on. Hmm. Okay, this day is officially too boring. Look on the bright side, Cricket. Perhaps learning to cope with the mind-numbing tedium of our own existence could be its own form of entertainment. Nah. We need something wild and exciting. Something... Something unexpected! - Mama! - Kids, what if I told you your mama has a special surprise waiting for you right outside? I'd be tantalized and intrigued. Yeah, Mom surprise. Wait, this isn't one of those surprises like how Dad tricks me into doing chores, right? Cricket, I've got a big surprise waiting for you in the laundry room. Hmm. Oh, this is way better than laundry, kiddos. Introducing your very own dirt bike. It's... It's... It's so beautiful. Built her from some spare parts in the shop. She can haul, if I do say so myself. Oh, my. Well, aren't you quite the steed. I shall tame her, and we shall be as horse and rider. Thank you, Mommy. Hey, everybody. Finished baking cookies... No! Hey, Bill. You got the kids a dirt bike? So... - This thing safe? - Of course. I rode these things all the time as a kid, and look how I turned out. - Hmm. - Bill? Hurtful. Hey, kidding. You kids'll be careful on that thing, right? Absolutely, Papa... Cricket, for Pete's sake, slow down! Cricket's never slowing down again. If only there was something to jump! Whee! Whoa. - Yeah! - Son, look out! Huh? We're dead. Gotcha. That could have been me. Cricket! You okay? I-I-I don't know. My bones ain't broke. But the bike sure is. Nothing a little fixing can't fix. - Aah! - Cricket, it's okay. It's just a backfire. I ain't riding anymore. You can't make me. I ain't making you do nothing. Wait. Something's wrong. It's like my brain's trying to think before doing things. - I've gone insane! - No, dear brother. You're finally experiencing the fragility of life. Like that of the humble egg. May I? We are but delicate shell and yolk. All it takes is one slip or mistake, and... - Tilly, quit wasting food. - Aah! My whole life I've been running around acting crazy, having no clue I was such a fragile little egg! Uh, Nance? A little help? Calm down, Cricket. You just need to be a bit safer, is all. I'm going to go fix up the bike. When you're ready to hop back on, just give me a holler. But I don't know how to be safe. And it's not like I know some lame, boring, old, safety-loving expert who can teach me. Sun's strong today. Did everyone put on their sunscreen? Bingo-bango. Father! Father! I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but can you teach me your ways of safety? Yes. Yes, I can. All right, Cricket. The secret to staying safe is threat assessment. Assess threats. Got it. And there's no better way to assess threats than the uh-oh technique. I am intrigued. Please continue. The uh-oh technique is my own personal system for identifying danger. Allow me to demonstrate. Uh-oh, some rusty nails. Uh-oh neutralized. Very interesting. Uh-oh, Miss Brenda's looking mighty mean today. Better set up a perimeter so no one gets kicked by her powerful haunches. Don't get kicked? Okay, that's a lot to take in. Just steer clear of the "uh-ohs," and you won't get uh-ohs of your own. - Now you give it a try. - All right. Assess threats. Hmm. Dog is uh-oh? Hmm. Rake is uh-oh? Correct. Someone could step on that and get bonked in the nogging. Now you're thinking safe. Uh-oh! A bee! Somebody could get stung by that bee. Wow! Two for two. And then, after they get stung in the face, they could stumble uncontrollably, crashing into the apple tree. - Uh-oh! - Yeah. I guess that could happen. And then the apples, they will fall, pelting my delicate shell one after the other, till I crack open like the fragile little egg that I am. Aah! Uh-oh. Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh! That pigeon could peck my shell till my yolk drips out. Uh-oh! Uh-oh. Uh-oh. These blades of grass could slice me right open! Ow! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Cricket? Hey there, buddy. - Uh-oh. Uh-oh. - Seeing a lot of uh-oh's, huh? The outside is full of danger. Got to get inside. Sir, I suggest you do the same! Uh-oh. And tighten the swing arm. And we're done. Phew. Too bad Cricket doesn't want to try again. How about you, Till? Think you're ready for a ride? Oh, I'm ready, Mama. But the question is, is Geraldine? Geral-whomst? That's what I've decided to name the bike. Before we ride, we have to connect with each other as equals. Trust is the foundation between a rider and her steed. Allow me to soothe your soul with a calming melody. Well, while you're busy bonding, I think I'll check in on your brother. Sug? You in here? Uh, Cricket? Hello, Mother. Hey, kiddo. So, what's all this? Just taking a few safety precautions. Did you know the most common place people get injured is in their own home? We've been living in a death trap this whole time. No telling how many uh-ohs could happen. Uh-ohs? That doesn't sound like a Cricket thing. Sounds more like a... Bill. Did you teach him this? Maybe. Listen, Cricket, I wanted you to be safe, but I wasn't expecting this much zeal. Oh, typical Bill. Of course you wouldn't understand. What's that supposed to mean? Well, no offense Dad, but we all know you don't take safety as seriously as you should. - Excuse me? - I'm so safety-minded, I invented these things to protect my feet. I call them hard socks. Cricket, those already exist. They're called shoes. Well, well, Mr. Know-It-All. Okay Cricket, that's enough. Listen, I finished fixing up the bike. Maybe you should hop on and try again. Prove there's nothing to be scared of. Aw, you're cute. Little baby Crickey is never going to do anything needlessly reckless again. This is the new life I choose, Mother. Being a safe bubble-wrapped boy. Well, off to find some more industrial-grade bubble wrap to use on the rest of the house. Bill, a word. Okay, we broke our son. What are we going to do to fix this? Now hold on, Nance. I know he's going a little overboard, but isn't it a good thing that he's being a bit extra careful? I don't know. Oh, hey, Dad? FYI, I'm getting rid of all the dangerous objects we have, so all your farm tools had to go. - You're welcome. - What? Yeesh. What should we...? - Get the boy. - Right. Cricket! I can't believe I'm saying this, but please go back to being a reckless kid. We just want our old Cricket back. No! I'll never go back to the way I was. Turtle maneuver. Cricket, we're just trying to help you. I can't believe this. My own family is now a threat to my safety. Well, uh-oh to you. Uh-oh to you all. Well, if that's the way you feel. Mama! Sweet Geraldine and I have forged an unbreakable bond. We are now ready to ride. That's my girl. Hey, bud, your sister and I are going to go riding. Sure would love to have you come along. Wait, how can they still be going riding? It's too dangerous. Don't they know they could get hurt? Uh-oh! Tilly, get off that thing! Oh! - Got your helmet on, hon? - Right here, Mama. - Safety roll. - Cricket? What are you doing? - I'm saving you. - Well, stop it. You're going to spook Geraldine. Geraldine's dangerous. - Whoa! - Cricket! Geraldine! My bubble wrap armor is caught in the throttle. Maybe if I just yank it real hard, like th... Aah! I just made it worse! Cricket, grab my hand! Cricket! Just take off that bubble wrap and control the bike! It isn't safe. Cricket, life isn't some death trap! Oh, no, not another one. We got to finish this bridge. Well, I guess there's only one thing left to do. Emergency turtle maneuver! Look, honey, you can't just hide from the world. See, life is like, well, a dirt bike. Yeah, it can be dangerous, but you're safer steering than turtling. So face your fears and take control of your life. Yeah, that's my boy. Chew that plastic. Uh, okay, you're really getting in there. I'm free! Oh, no! A child! Aah! Aah! Oh, Cricket Green. Take control. Good job, kid! I'm doing it! I'm really doing it! Hmm. Face your fears. Yeah! Hooray. Nice jump, sug. How you feel? I... I feel alive. See, hon? You just needed to find some balance. Or maybe you just shouldn't have a dirt bike. Agreed. Okay, kiddo, let's get you home. Hey, Mom, can we pop a wheelie?
