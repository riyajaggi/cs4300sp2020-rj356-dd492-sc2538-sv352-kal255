 And now, back to Filthy, Rich, and Hungry! I'm sorry, ma'am, but I don't think gold lobsters exist. Blue was the best we could do! Do you know who I think I am? If I say I want gold lobster, I get it! Mmm. Content. Son, are you still watchin' TV? What can I say? I like to be entertained. Well, why not read a book? Like your sister! Where am I? What time is it? Aww, look how invested she is!

 See, the thing is, reading requires focus, and my brain ain't havin' none of that. Monkeys runnin' the zoo, know what I mean? Where's the bathroom? Where's the bathroom?! It's best not to fight it. Books are fun, Cricket! They're full of atmosphere, amazing new worlds, fascinatin' characters, - and sometimes, they kiss. - What? - What? - Y'all talkin' 'bout books? Gramma, you like readin' books? Darn tootin'! Books are for everybody! Just gotta find the right one to get ya started. Well, I would like to enjoy reading for once... I'm in! Let's get Cricket a book!

 - Yeah! - But where in the city are we gonna find a place with an endless catalogue of books? Oh, the library! Dewey Decimal, here I come! Hold up. What's this? Huh? Oh, that? That's just to hold all the books I'm gonna acquire. This is full of toys! Bouncy balls, board games, Blego Blocks?! I'm weak! I wanna find a book, but I know my brain! If it's not constantly stimulated, I will lose it! We won't let that happen. We're here for you, brother! Yeah, we're not leavin' until we get you a book! Eh! What, you say summ'? Let's go. All right. The "liberry" is a quiet place... - "Library." - And the "liberrians"... Papa, there's an "R" you're missin'. Oh, sorry. The "liberrarians"... Never mind. ...take their jobs very seriously. So, we don't wanna get on their bad side. We have to be quiet, too?! This'll be the hardest thing I've ever done! See, Cricket? It's great here! You probably feel your need to be constantly distracted fading away... We're going to the moon! Sorry! Heh. Aah! Cricket! Tsk, tsk, tsk. There will be no noises in the library, young man. So you better watch yourself. I have very good hearing. What was that? Speak up! Dang hearin' aid's on the fritz. You're new here, so this will be your only warning. One more sound, and you're banned for good. Is whisperin' allowed? Not... one... more... sound. Hey, I've been meanin' to ask, can we get a puppy? Shh... We can't talk, but we can use sign language! Wait, y'all don't know sign language? Hm. Hello! I love, uh... you! Sorry. Me not know much. That's OK. You three can just do charades. Charades! Charades! Good brain, Cricket. We... find... Cricket... book. Let my favorite fantasy books carry you away to another world! Murder mysteries! All right, Cricket, time to find a book. Wonder what Gramma's got for me. All right, pretty cool cover. It's a little thick, though. Just flip to the end real quick... Five hundred pages?! Blech! No, thanks. Maybe Tilly's got somethin' better. The Feasts of Evermore, huh? Worth a shot. "Chapter One. In a candlelit room adorned with fine silks, Lord Elnar Sunbreaker waited impatiently for the arrival of the Githurian Ambassador. The tantalizing scent of honeyed plums and pickled goose fat wafted heavy upon the air, - but Elnar was tempted by neither." Ugh. Never mind. Hm? Hm. Bleh! OK, the tricklin' water should drown out our voices, so we can talk without the "liberrian" hearin' us. So, what's wrong, son? Did you not enjoy the books Gramma and Tilly picked out? I tried my best, but I can tell my brain is protesting. Well, maybe those weren't the right books. Why don't you let ol' Daddy-o pick out somethin' for ya? Well, OK, I'll give it a shot. Movies! No... movie. You... book. Uh... mm. Hm. The Adventures of Lil' Abe. All right, brain, this is your dad's favorite book. It could be yours as well, as long as you concentrate. Just take it one line at a time. "Lil' Abe lived in a log cabin." Log cabin... dog cabin... dog captain! Dog Captain! What are you doing? We're headed right for that iceberg! Dog Captain, slow down! Oh, Dog Captain, please, we have families! Ehh! Ehh... Ugh, this is boring. Quick, while he's distracted, let's sneak downstairs and get a movie! I dunno, brain, Dad said to read this book. Oh, yeah? Well, the brain is like the dad of your body, so you should listen to me instead. Hm, that's actually a really good point. OK! Let's do it! Shh! Come on! Phew! Ahh! Shush! I think it's safe to whisper in here. - Cricket! - Huh? Ahh! Hey, son. You left this upstairs. - Oh. Thanks. - What's wrong? I tried, Dad, but I just couldn't get into Lil' Abe either. Maybe the problem isn't books, it's me and my stimuli-chasin' brain. Don't give up on yourself just yet. We can come back another day and try again. Yeah, I guess. Let's go home. Let's collect Gramma and head outta here. Was that so hard? Librarians, assemble. Dang thing's always buggin' out. Oh, snap. Everyone, split up! Wow! Pictures? Action? Mystery? Sound effects spelled out? Dang, this book's got everything! And it just keeps going? Wow! Ho-ho! Uh-oh! Oh, that's good! I. Love. You. - Dad! - You're OK! Yeah. Banned from all libraries across the globe. I didn't know they had that authority. But it was all worth it to give you the gift of reading! Thanks, Dad! I'm super excited to read this when we get home! I'm really glad you found a book that suits your interests. Me, too! I'm also glad we're back outside again. Now, we can be as loud as we want! Come, scream with me, family! "And then they all screamed into the sunset. The End." Shh! Gather round, gather round, and welcome to Bring Your Family to Work Day, where I get to show you how I do my job. This here is our coffee station, where I make all that good bean juice. Wow, son, it's so great to be able to watch you work! Ha-ha-ho! You're gonna do more than watch. Who wants to get the hands-on experience? - Brown? My favorite color! - Ooh! Very nice! Hey. I see what you're doing, tricking your family into doing work for you. Maybe... What do you think Ms. Cho would think about this? She's fine with it! Ugh. Whatever. I've got eyes on you, Cricket Green. Eyes from five slightly different camera angles. After my next big plan, you and your family will regret ever stepping foot in my city! In Chip Whistler's city! Actually, sir, the city's more of a mix between public and private lands with four zones devoted solely to residential... I don't care about zoning laws! What I care about is taking down the Green family, once and for all! I'll admit, my plans of the past have all had... mishaps. Operation Crop Cover was brilliant on paper. Hm? Good luck growing vegetables without the sun! But there were too many technical setbacks. Same goes for Operation Stand Sabotage. Whoa...! No matter how much work I put into a plan, there's always something that gets in my way! Aaah... Oof! That last one might have been a sleep-deprived hallucination. Ah, sorry to interrupt your extended monologue, but the VP is here to see you. Hello, Chip. Ahh! No! I like it spooky! Sorry, Chip, but we've been waiting on you to sign these forms for weeks. I don't have time for this! Also, the board's weekly meeting is starting soon. As the Wholesome Foods CEO, you really should be there. Sorry, but I've got too much on my plate here, chipping... ...away at a much more pressing issue, so thank you for nothing, goodbye! Now, where were we? Oh, right. Watch out, Cricket Green. I've still got one last trick up my sleeve. Aw, jeez, what have you gotten yourself into, Bill? So many little parts! - Hiya, Pop! - Ohh! How's the Big Coffee Hands-On Experience goin'? OK, I guess, but cleanin' this thing is a bit harder than I imagined. Actually, I could really use your help. Heh-heh, oh, no you don't, big guy. I've got full confidence in you. Oh! Heh. Heck. Hey, Tilly, how's the moppin'... I mean, water drawing going? You're just in time! Princess Clementine and Prince Salvador just eloped! "Oh, my dearest Clementine, let us smooch. Mwah!" Aren't they just perfect for each other? Great work, Tilly! Just don't forget to erase the whole floor now! - You got it, brother! - Fantastic! - Hey, Gramma! Grindin' up those beans real good, huh? Ha! You thought I couldn't do it, but I'm showin' you! Yes. Yes you are, madam. Keep on at it, everyone! I gotta go take my state-mandatory four-to-six-hour break now... Whoa! Against the law if I don't! But I'll be back to join y'all after. This is insane. You're just gonna let him lay around all day? It's fine, because he convinced his family to work for free? Why didn't I bring my family? You know they live really far away! B-Besides, Bring Your Family to Work Day isn't a real thing! What the heck is that? Oh, you mean my Wholesome Foods Coffee Truck? Oh, never mind, it's just Chip. What on earth are you doing? Little lady, I am putting Big Coffee out of business! And then Cricket will have to get a new job, and the commute will probably be really long, and he will be so inconvenienced! And how, exactly, do you plan on putting Big Coffee out of business? Sir! Are you looking for a coffee? Oh! Yeah, I was just gonna go in here and buy some. No need! Greg, top him off! Stop. Venti, venti. Hey, buddy, you had enough? I have! Thank you! Goodbye! Now, do that grandma! Huh? Thank you! I'll be here day and night, caffeinating any thirsty customer who comes close to this place! And you'll be out of business in less than a week! Don't worry, Ms. Cho. Chip's plan ain't gonna work. Uh, excuse me? What do you mean, it's not gonna work? Chip, you're a joke! We all know how this goes! First, you make a goofy little plan, it fails, you chip your tooth. And then I come out on top. Bingo bango. I'm... I'm not a joke! You're a joke! - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm yourself. - Hello! - Oh! Just a heads-up, citizen. You seem to have parked next to a fire hydrant. Ugh! Just give me a citation or whatever. Sure! No sweat! Also, heads-up, you're getting towed on account of what I said earlier about that fire hydrant. What?! Wha-wha-whoa! Whaa...! Aah! Hey, is everything OK out he... Oh, never mind, it's just Chip. Is that all ya got? A tow truck? Ha-ha! Is this where my plan fails and I chip my tooth? 'Cause good luck! I have titanium teeth now! And they'll never... I'm sorry to inform you that I still haven't chipped my tooth, thanks to my indestructible... Told ya, Chip. A nice one for my collection. Good try! Huh? Cricket's right. I'm a joke. - Chip? - Hey, Dad. Son, I hear you've been skipping out on your CEO duties lately. Yeah, I've been busy... trying to destroy the Gr... Uh, a... a work problem! Yeah, destroy a work problem! Well, what's the holdup? You're the boss now! I know! It's just that things always backfire on me. You don't have to go it alone, son. Put the company to work for you. -The company? - Wholesome Foods is yours now. That comes with a lot of power and resources. Enough to take care of any little work problem that comes along. You're a CEO. All you gotta do is start acting like one. - Yeah... - Love you, son. Mm-hmm. Uh, hey, boss. Everything OK? I have no need for you two anymore. You're both fired. - What? - Get out! Things are going to be a little different from now on. The third quarter numbers are looking favorable for the... Chip! So glad you could spare a few minutes out of your busy schedule to do your job. Fair point. I've been too busy chasing side ventures to see the bigger picture. But those days are over. From here on out, I'm all in. So get out of my chair. Yes, Mr. Whistler. We are at the dawn of a new era for Wholesome Foods. May I present to you all... my Wholesome Foods expansion plan. Is everyone ready for day two of Bring Your Family to Work Day? Hey, c'mon, now! I expect my workers to have a better attitude than that! Workers? Has all this been some sorta ruse to make us do your job for you? What? You wound me, father! I would never besmirch the good name of Bring Your Family to Work Day. That's not a thing, is it? All right, all right, you got me. Gosh, I hope I grow up to be as smart and perceptive as you, Father. Oh! Well, shoot, Cricket, I... Hey, stop that! I've had enough! Let's all get outta here and leave Cricket to his job! - Ah, dang it. - And what have you learned from this, brother? Tricking your family only works for so long, so enjoy it while it lasts. Hello, Green family! Hey look, it's Chip! What's the plan, you gonna pry open the register and knock out your front tooth? Cricket, we've seen his tooth do that already! It's gonna be front tooth stays in, but all the rest fall out around it. Kids, please! It'll be a canine or somethin' from the lower set. My money's on a molar. You guys are too... funny. I'd like to introduce you guys to my new Wholesome Squad. Well, hello, young man... Aah! What the heck?! Oof! Sir, I don't think you're allowed to do that. - Dad! - You leave him alone, Chip! Uh... Ms. Cho... Pause it for a sec, fellas. Sorry about that. They're just excited to get a head start on dismantling. Quit hidin' behind your goons, and fight me yourself, coward! - Yah! - Aw, Cricket. Attacking an old friend isn't very wholesome, now, is it? That's enough, Chip. Either get out, or we're calling the police. Oh, there's no need for that. True, I don't own the place yet, but I will in about... five seconds. Mmm! Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Peace out, my dudes. OK. Now, I own it. Which reminds me, you're all fired. Get out. OK, his plan is working, but where's the part where it backfires on him? That's gotta be next, right? Hey, Cricket! Thank you so much for helping me get on the right track. I'd have stayed the same forever without your advice. But I think my Wholesome Foods expansion plan will need a bit... more... space. Who's a joke now? Adios, Cricket! This ain't good. Is he comin' after the house? That would really not be good! Yeah, 'cause we still live in it! I'm out of a job! How am I gonna pay rent? Are we gonna lose our house?! Chip has finally gone insane! What the heck is going on?! Chip can't win! It can't end like this! And yet... it just... did. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
