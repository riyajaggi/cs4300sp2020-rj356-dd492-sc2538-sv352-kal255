 It's the video. It's the video. Oh, yeah, it's the video. - No, it's not. - Yeah, it is. Remember that time you violently pelted that kid with tomatoes? What, what? That's right, baby! Chip! Chip! Chip! Well, it kind of went viral, and now no one wants to shop here. That was taken out of context! Aw! Chip chipped my phone. Kinda like your teeth every time you see that kid!

 Your name is a joke now. - - Grr! You're all fired! - - Yeah, right. If I never met the Greens, none of this would have happened. This is all their fault! Those horrible, filthy Greens will pay! And that's my impression of a salmon! - Proud of you. - Wow. Who wants a peanut butter ball? - - Ooh, I'll take one! Wha...? I'll take a ball... A wrecking ball, that is... Because I'm going to wreck your house and drive you Greens out of town once and for all. Bye-bye, Greens! Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Don't quote me on this, but I believe murder is illegal. - Oh, no! - Aaahhh! - - Oh, no, no, no! Aw, come on! Oh, Chip. You don't understand. These people hurt our business and disrespect my very expensive and perfect teeth. Wholesome Food needs to be a friend to farmers. Knockin' down a local farmer's house and pelting a farm boy with tomatoes. Tomatoes are for eatin'. Those go in here. What happened to you? What happened to... my boy? Uh, he got way hotter. If you'd ever done any farming, like I did in my co-op days, you'd know you reap what you sow. You know, my retirement's coming up, and I was plannin' to put you in charge. But you've backed me into a corner here. I hate to do this, son, but.. you're out. Wha... what...? Daddy, no! Tell me what to do. I-I'll do anything. Maybe if you prove you're really sorry for what you've done to that family. I'm really sorry, I swear! Not to me, to them. Aww. One of your forgiveness contracts? This is how Daddy knows it's real. Get each of the Greens to sign, and I'll reconsider your future with this company. You go it, Dad. I mean, how hard can it be? Hey, Dad, can I try? Son, I'm gonna be honest... I don't trust you with a hammer. Hey, hey! How y'all doin'? Chip's back to finish what he started! Call the police! Got it. I do hope they send the dogs this time. Whoa, whoa, hey! I am not here to start any... I got him! - Now hold on... Whoa! - Keep him pinned, boy! Let's see how well this bougie trash can tear up the house... when he's got no hands! Aaahhh! No, you don't understand! I'm here to apologize! Wait, what? Well, I think that's lovely. It takes a big man to say that he's sorry. That's why Papa's always apologizin' to everyone. Sorry, sorry! I was in the bushes over there. What's goin' on? Chip's here to apologize... supposedly. - - Aaahhh! Oh. Is that true? Yeah, yeah, no, listen, um... I realize putting a wrecking ball through someone's house might not have been, uh, appropriate, so, yeah, so, sorry. I hope we can move on and grow as people. Yadda yadda yadda. Now that that is out of the way, if we could just sign this contract, I can get out of here. Ha! You expect us to accept that weak apology? Do it better, coward! You heard the sweet lady! I'm sorry, from the bottom of my heart, and stuff. Ehh. Yeesh. That was, uh... - ...quite... - ...pathetic! Face it, Chip, you ain't got a sincere bone in your body! ...sincere bone in your body! Well, Chip, if you're truly sorry, you should repair the damage you've caused. That will make us square, right, family? Right, family? Fine. So, if I fix your shack, you'll sign my contract. Absolutely. Do we have a deal? All right, it's a deal. All right, Chip, I'm gonna walk you through the roof repair. Oh, man! Chip doing physical labor? It's just so satisfying! All right, pick up a panel. - - Good, good. Now put it in place. Great! Look at me, overexplaining things. You're an adult man. You know what you're doin'. Ohh. ...Oh, my gosh! He... he doesn't know how to use a hammer! Bless his heart, Cricket, he's tryin'. All right, next panel. Hold up there, buddy. Generally, when I build something, I use more than one nail. Let's add some more! It's fine! Let's move on. It's not gonna hold with one nail. If you're so concerned... Let me test it out for you. Ha! Whoa! Aah! What was that? Is everyone okay? Oh, it's you. I don't care. Well, I guess I'm outside now. I'm fine, I'm fine. Some ugly flowers broke my fall. Wha...? This is my vegetable garden. You pulled up all my carrots! Look at him... he ain't even a baby carrot yet. He's just a little preemie. Well, we'll just add it to your to-do list. "To-do list"? Well, yeah. You agreed to fix all the damage you caused, and you just caused more damage. No, no, no, no, no. I just agreed to fix the roof, and then I'm driving myself to the nearest doctor to get a lobotomy performed on my brain so I never have to think of this or you ever again! Well, that's a little extreme, Chip. The agreement was that we don't sign the contract until you fix what you broke. And if you were truly sorry, wouldn't you be happy to help? Just tell me what I need to do. - How's it goin' over there, Chip? - Great. You know, work's a lot more fun when you've got a song in your soul. ♪ Do-do-do do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Farming's what we like to do ♪ ♪ Nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh ♪ ♪ It's honest work, and easy, too ♪ ♪ Nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh ♪ - All together now! - ♪ Farming's what we like to do ♪ - ♪ Nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh ♪ - Ah, just ignore them. ♪ You're not really sorry... Nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh ♪ Shut up! Shut up, shut up! You killed him! Murderer! He was my brother! - - Chip! Chip, wake up! Huh. He must have passed out from exhaustion. We've only been out here for ten minutes! I need to get out of here! Well, you haven't fixed much of anything yet, plus you buried the kids' bikes when you were hallucinatin'. No worries. I'll just add it to the list. Add it.. to... the list? Ah, the never-ending list! Fffffffine. Why don't you add this to the list, too! And this, and this, and this! - Uh, Chip. - Go ahead, and keep adding it up! But if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me! He's headed for the garden! Not on my watch! Gaaahhh! Aaahhh! If he hadn't already chipped his tooth, that's where he would have done it. Where am I? What is this filthy hovel? Well, uh, this is our home. Uh... frozen peas? What, you want me to fix those, too? Oh, no, no, son. You can't fix peas... They're perfect just the way they are. But when frozen, they can help fix a bump to the noggin. Uh... thanks. That's... nice of you. I don't deserve your pity peas. No, you don't, but that's how we treat folks here... With common decency. We're just glad you're okay. I'm not okay. My dad's gonna be so upset. Huh? What's your dad got to do with this? He's the CEO of Wholesome Foods, and he's the one who wanted me to say sorry and get this contract signed. Well, uh... are you sorry? No! Yes. Ugh, I don't know. But if I don't do this, then I'm out of the company. I guess I've completely messed everything up. You know, Chip, I understand how you feel. Uh, how? You're, like, poor. You can sass me if you want, but I'm just bein' honest. It's like I'm always tellin' my boy... You gotta put in the work before you can reap the rewards. Huh. That's what my dad's always telling me. It might not be easy, but if you do that, you can have anything you want in life. Green family, I'm sorry, for everything. I mean, I know things haven't always been great between me and, well, mostly Cricket, but I'd like to turn things around, for reals. I'm gonna finish what I started... The roof, the garden, everything... Because it's what you all deserve. Huh? ♪ Ta-da! ♪ What? But I didn't even finish fixing your house! Well, Chip, I didn't wanna sign because I didn't think you could be sincere about an apology. But I can see that this time, you really mean it. So we'd be happy to sign this as a family! Ah, fine! Sure. But you still better fix everything you messed up, bougie boy! I think I can swing that. Oops. They say the only constant in life is change, and that sure is the case here at Wholesome Foods. With my retiring, someone new is stepping into my position. Choosing that person was easy because I've seen him change for the better. I, of course, am talking about my son, Chip Whistler, the new CEO of Wholesome Foods! Hey hey. Mmm. I know you'll make me proud, son. Wow. - Hard to believe it's all mine now. - Yeah, boss. Real nice of you to patch things up with that family. That was pretty nice of me. But now things are gonna change. All right, let's can this junk. Send in my private dentist. Heya, Chip! How's my most frequent customer doin'? I think I'm ready for an upgrade. Platinum. Oh ho ho! Yes, sir! I've put in the work and I've reaped the rewards. And now I have the full power and resources of the Wholesome Foods Corporation to finally run the Greens out of Big City!
