 Oh, Gabriella, if only you knew‐‐ ‐Hey, pal! ‐Aah! Remy! Cricket, you've been staring at Gabriella Espinosa like a cat watching a laser pointer. Ever since the Valentine's dance, I haven't stopped thinking about her. But because you danced with her that night, I assumed you and her were going out? What? No. Gabs and I are just old friends. But, Cricket, you can't just stare at her until she likes you. It's creepy. Go talk to her. What? No, I can't. If I tell her I like her, she might say that she hates me.

 Or even worse, she might tell me that she likes me back. Either way, I'll drop dead. [groaning] [Remy] Cricket, do you believe in angels? Every time I've needed help you've been my guardian angel. And now here you are, in trouble. Who will help you? Oh, it's me. ‐Remy's the angel! ‐[whistle blows] All right, kids. I'm Community Sue. Is everyone having fun at the community center? Whoo! Today, I'm painting a mural out back and need some volunteers. I know Gabriella's in. ‐Yeah. ‐That's the spirit. Who else? Cool, Cricket's in. What? No, I didn't volunt‐‐ Remy? What the heck are you doing? I'm giving you a little push. You're always helping me out, but today I'm helping you. But I don't want to. ‐[whistle blows] ‐[Sue] Green! Hoof it! Why, why, why, why? You're going to do great. ‐Hey, Cricket. ‐Hi. [stammers and laughs nervously] Hello, Gabriella. Okay, I'll see you out there. [panting] ‐[blows whistle] ‐Other Green! ‐Girl Green! ‐Yes, ma'am? You're in charge of checking out equipment while I'm gone. You mean, I'll be in charge of the entire community center? No. I just need you to write down who's using like, dodgeballs and stuff. Community Sue's office. Nay, Community Tilly's office. A peaceful transition of power. All right, kids, I've got rollers and brushes, your standard set of primaries, and I've even drawn out a preliminary sketch as reference. If there's any muscle that doesn't make sense anatomically, draw it in anyways. Hm. Very subtle. Okay, I have no clue how we'll do this. But I guess if we start by mixing a few colors... ‐Mural's this way, Green. ‐[Cricket whimpering] Hey, could you pass me a brush? [gasps] Thanks. You look like you know your way around a canvas. Which part do you want to paint first? [Cricket] Oh, no. She asked you a question. Say something. Say anything. [clears throat] ‐[wheezes] ‐What? What's wrong? Are you having a medical emergency? If you don't give me a verbal response, I will be forced to perform an emergency tracheotomy with this pin. [coughs and wheezes] I'm good, man. [gasps breathlessly] Over there... Hey, Mr. Smoothie. How's it going? Why, Remy? Why'd you make me do this? [slurps] I was happy with the way things were. Staying far away from her, muttering to myself. It wasn't much, but it was an honest life. What am I supposed to do? I can't get within ten feet of her without my brain turning to mush. Well, that's why you've got me, you silly. Take one of these earpieces Vasquez gave me. This way, I can be in your ear and tell you exactly what to say to Gabriella. Well, okay, but only because I can't do any worse. ‐Enter. ‐Hey, hey. Weezie here to check out boxing gloves. Yes, yes, you and dozens of other children. But tell me, is all I'm meant to do as community director just check out equipment? Does my administration sit idly by, or do I seek the change that I know the people deserve? Don't trip, just flip the script. [laughs] Yeah, I'm leaving now. Flip the... of course. Today, I begin a legacy the Big City Community Center will never forget. Okay, Remy, I'm in position. Perfect. Now do exactly as I say. Nice. Nice. Oh, hey. I figured we could start with the background first. Okay, shake her hand. Oh. Left hand. [Remy] Okay, maintain eye contact. Slight bend to the knees. Maintain eye contact! Okay. I guess we have a deal. This is great. You two are exchanging biorhythms. Now, disengage. ‐I said, disengage! ‐Aah! Now, say, "Do you like dressage?" [Cricket] What's dressage? Competitive horse dancing. Say it. So, Gabriella, do you like dressage? Actually, I only like things that aren't stupid. [snickers] Dressage isn't stupid! How dare you? Uh, how dare you? You're being weird. [Remy] You're being weird! You're being weird. Uh, I'm going to get more paint. Oh, okay, well, I didn't mean to... [sighs and grumbles] Eep! Remy! I can't believe that you're worse at girls than I am. Stay out of my ear holes unless you got something good. Hm. I was supposed to be helping Cricket today. And here I am, making a whole mess out of everything. ‐[Vasquez] Master Remy. ‐Huh? ‐Vasquez? ‐Master Remy. I got an alert that your heart rate is spiking. Are you okay? Can I help you in any way? [gasps] I think so! [cats meowing] [grunts and clears throat] My fellow men and women of the Big City Community Center. Who, me? You may have noticed some of the changes, nay, improvements my administration has brought. Stray cats have been welcomed, for they too are members of the community. Also, glitter has been added to the drinking fountains, not because it was easy, but because it was pretty. And all balls have been given names and faces. I say, liberty and justice for balls. ‐Whoo! You're weird as heck. ‐Thank you. Vasquez, you couldn't have called at a better time. ‐Are you busy? ‐I'm just guarding your mother's luncheon. Cool, cool. Second question: Do you know anything about love? Do I know anything about love? I know love can fill your heart, but also leave it empty. Yes. I know love. Bingo bango. You kids are being awful quiet. Talk. Engage. After all, this is the community center. Be communal. Okay. [gulps] Hey, uh, Gabriella, Big City sure is something, huh? It is... a big city. So, you like painting murals? No way. They're making me do this because last week, I got on the intercom and said the word "dookie." Whoa! That was you? I love your work. Man, they're really getting strict here. Last month I got on the intercom and said "trash butt," and they only sent me home with a letter. [laughs] Wait, what? Yeah. But before giving it to my dad, I rewrote the letter to say that they were thanking me for saying "trash butt." [giggles] Did it work? ‐No! ‐Well, whatever. Trash butt's funny. I don't know. I think dookie's classic. Well, I guess we should keep painting. Uh, yeah. Hey, what do you say we team up and do pranks this weekend? Oh, that'd be fun. But I'm leaving soon for Montreal. Montreal? Oh, my gosh. Gabriella is moving? [Remy, over earpiece] Cricket, I know I messed up, but this time I've got something good. I hope it's good enough to stop a girl from moving to Europe. Okay, Vasquez, let her rip. My nights are illuminated by your kindness. The rain... My nights are illuminated by your kindness. The rain... Hey, Gabriella? ‐What's up? ‐Uh, my nights are illuminated by your kindness. The rain kept off my head by your smile. Cricket, are you teasing me? Your smile, as radiant as your purple blazer. Uh, your radiant purple blazer. Hey, buddy... [Vasquez] I would stand against the winds of nature itself. With tender glances, douse me, hedonist goddess. Why don't we just paint? Uh... Douse me, hedonist goddess. ‐Just paint. ‐Douse me, hedon‐‐ ‐Paint. ‐Douse me head in paint! Douse me head in paint! [grunts] Sorry, dude, I'd love to figure out what's going on here, but I've got to catch my bus for Montreal. Bye. Aah! I'm sorry, buddy. I messed up. Well, she's moving to Montreal anyways, so this plan was doomed from the start. Whoa! That girl likes you. What makes you say that? I'm good at reading social situations! [panting] Oh, my gosh. Gabriella likes me? I got to find out for sure. Come on, Remy, we've got a bus to catch. Ah. Good kids. Terrible painters, though. [Cricket] Gabriella wait! Wait! [panting] ‐She's gone. ‐Don't worry. I already called in the cavalry. Excuse me, Master Cricket, but perhaps I may be of assistance. [grunts and yells] Thanks for helping me today, Remy. What? But I didn't know what I was doing. ‐[both scream] ‐That's okay. What matters is that you gave me a push! Vasquez, that's the bus. [grunts and exclaims] For love. Ah! Hey. [laughs] Uh, hey, Cricket. What are you doing here? Gabriella, I... I like you. And I just wanted to know... do you like me too? Yeah. Do you want to go out? Oh, does that mean we have to, like, hold hands all the time? ‐What? No. ‐Do we gotta exchange gifts and flowers? Ew. No. Do we got to smooch? No, weirdo. It just means we get to tell people we're going out. Oh, okay. Well, then, yeah, I'm in. Well, this is my stop. Wait, I thought you were moving to Montreal. No, I'm just going there for vacation. I kept trying to tell you, but you were too busy talking to Remy on that earpiece. See you when I'm back. Yeah. See you when you're back. Hey, Cricket. How'd it go? Well, let's just say that Cricket Green's got a girlfriend! Well, the mural was a bust, but at least things here are under control? ‐[cats meowing] ‐[kids chattering] [whimpering] Welcome back, ma'am. I'd say with all these reforms, I have successfully secured my legacy. Well, goodbye.
