 Finally got that big promotion! What? She just started that job two months ago! It takes more muscles to frown than it does to smile! Well, it takes even less muscles to scroll! We bought a house, and all it took was hard work and a lot of money from my parents! What? That's not hard work! Being happy is so easy! It's not that easy. It is not that easy! [gasps] No, no, no, no, no! Oh, that was dumb! Please, don't be broken! Oh, it's broken. Why can't I just get it together? - Ow. - [man] Hey, quiet down over there! [sighs] Well, Gloria, you've always got tomorrow. Oh, I didn't realize it was so soon. Huh. Okay, here we go. Oh, right, parking costs money, Gloria! Everything in this city costs money. - Come on. - [change jingling] There! - [coin clinks] - Okay, I'll be quick. All right, I'll just be in and out. No distractions. ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ Hello, tall building! Cricket? And the rest of his crazy family? What are they doing here? Gloria? Oh, he saw me! Okay, door, close, please, please. Door, close. Gloria, was that you? Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Gloria, Gloria! I don't want to be social right now. - [elevator dings] - Yes, yes, they're closing. Woo, that was a close one. - Gyah! - Ah! Hi, Gloria! [screams] These dang doors just don't wanna open! Gloria, thanks for the holding the door for us. [laughs nervously] Yeah. Don't forget your extra large Tubby Punch, cricket. Ooh, thanks, Tilly. And I will drink this whole thing! [slurps] Now I told you not to buy that! You'll be running to the bathroom all day! You don't know anything! Son, one day, you'll realize - I do know a thing or two. - [grunting] Come on. Awe, come on, it's just an elevator, Grandma. I don't trust it! It's unnatural! How does it move up and down? Come on, you're letting all the oxygen out. What? What are you all doing here? It's City Exploration Day. We each take turns picking a new place to see. Last week, Tilly chose the History Museum, and this week, Cricket chose the, uh... Big glass elevator, big glass elevator! When it goes up and down, it makes you feel like you're flying! I did enough flying in the war! Plus, this big window makes it the best view in the city. So you all came here to ride the elevator? Great. So, the thing is, while it's fun seeing you all here, I'm actually in a little bit of a hurry. - Oh, really? - [slurping] - What are you up to? - Oh, don't worry about it. You wouldn't understand. Adult stuff. Mm-hm, mm-hm, mm-hm. Adult stuff. Shiny buttons. It'd be a shame not to press them all! - [elevator dings] - Going up. - Did you just press all the buttons? - Maybe. [gasps] I don't have time for this! Hey, you're undoing my hard work! [panel sizzling] [elevator voice] Going up, down, up, up. [everyone screaming] [heads thump] [everyone screaming] - [bodies thump] - [Bill] No, not again! [Grandma] I knew this would happen! Never trust a machine to run itself! - [panel explodes] - [all screaming] - [elevator crashes] - [thump] [gasps] Oh my gosh! Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no! The elevator's broken! We're trapped! I can't believe this is happening! Who knows how long we'll be stuck here? Well, being realistic, Gloria, probably forever. Our old way of life is dead. We must rebuild society from the ashes of the former. This will be Tilly's corner. Better pick a corner soon, they're going fast. That's it, I'm gonna jump! - [mumbling] - [thumps] Ma, you're overreacting. You've gotta stay calm. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. I can't believe this is happening. Oh, look on the bright side! Now we've got plenty of time to enjoy the view! See? Pretty neat, huh? I guess it is pretty... - Oh, no! - [meter clicks] My parking meter! I gotta get out of here! Oh. Right. [gasps] Elevator have emergency phones. - [slurping] - Son, you better quit that. You're gonna have to go to the bathroom. Come on, come on, come on! Yes! Gloria, the last thing we need to do is act like we're in some sort of crisis. Crisis! If I'm literally gonna go down, - I'm going down fighting! - Oh, Ma. [Operator] Hello, is anyone there? Yes, help! I'm trapped in an elevator! - Ma! - Let go! [grunting] [Operator] There's a lot of noise, can you repeat that? We are trapped - in an elevator! - Ma! - Boy, don't you dare! [yells] - Let go! Can you repeat... [crying] Oh, yeah, scrap metal. I'll take this, thanks. Eh... Okay, does anyone else have a phone? Oh, crabbledumpkins, I have a phone. Here, you make the call, Gloria. Oh, we're saved! Thank goodness! Give it here. Yeah, Dad, I've gotta get out of here, hand it over! Wait a minute. You're suddenly very eager to leave, Cricket. Is there a special reason why? Well, who wants to spend all day stuck in an elevator? Huh, interesting. What is going on? Could it be someone needs to use the bathroom because they drank their soda too fast, even though I told them not to? Okay, you know what? You two talk, while I take the phone. I need to hear this from him. It's okay if you've gotta go, Son. You've just gotta admit it. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't you dare. [slurps] Yeah, I'm just gonna grab this. Gloria, this is a teaching moment! -Okay, come on, come on. Pick up. -[phone ringing] [operator] We're sorry... [man] Bill Green. ...your phone plan does not allow calls - on days that end in Y, goodbye. - [phone clicks] [chuckling] Yeah, I got the most cheapest plan on the worst network. Cool! Cool, cool, cool, cool! So we're trapped in an elevator, and also out of phones. I didn't think I could be stuck anywhere worse than my crummy apartment, but I guess I was wrong! [carpet ripping] There, there. You're always welcome at my place. There's plenty of shade from the fluorescent lights, and I always have the latest post-apocalyptic fashions. Uh, that's actually weirdly comforting. - Thanks, Tilly. - You're welcome. I hope we can grow as friends until one of us has to inevitably eat the other. Okay! What'cha doing, Gloria? What I should have done from the start. Help, help, help, help, help, help, help! [man] Hey, we can hear you! Hey, it worked! Please, we're trapped! Can you get us out of here? [man] Yeah, we pried open the doors down here, all you've gotta do is open the doors on your side. Leave that to me! [grunting] There! - Kind of a squeeze. - Better hurry! I don't know how much longer we can hold this. Okay, we don't have much time. Boy, you're small and wily, shake a leg! I don't know, Ma. What if this thing starts moving again? Ah, I'm making a run for it! Cricket, wait! - [Bill grunts] - [cane snaps] [everyone screaming] [everyone groaning] Holy bologna, this could have been me! Is it so hard to imagine that your old dad might know what he's talking about? Yeah-huh. [sighs] Cricket, one day you'll figure out I'm just trying to look out for you. Yeah, but not, like, today, right? Oh, give it a rest, Cricket! You don't even know how lucky you are! If I had someone in this stupid city looking out for me, maybe I wouldn't be leaving! Leaving? What are you talking about, Gloria? This is my last day in Big City. I'm moving back to my hometown to live with my parents. Wha? My building management is on the 68th floor. I just came to return my apartment key. Everything I own is out in my car. You're... You're actually leaving? But, Gloria, I thought you loved Big City. How could you leave all of this? [sighs] The city is fine. I'm the one that's not good enough. Today is my three-year anniversary of moving to Big City. Three years. And yet, I'm still at the same crummy job, in the same crummy apartment. Moving here was supposed to be a stepping stone to Paris. What a joke. It's time to just throw in the towel. Well, I get it, Gloria. We had a hard time when we first moved here, too. I mean, we're still adjusting, but it gets better every day. That's easy for you to say. You're a family. You have each other. No one's here to support me. I'm failing, and I'm all alone. ♪ Firefighters ♪ ♪ We're here to save the day! ♪ Uh, what happened? Uh, finally! I've gotta get out of here. Gloria, wait! Stop! Listen to me! Gloria... I really wanna say something inspiring, but it's kind of hard to think right now! Son, just please, go to the bathroom! Yes, okay, thank you! [sighing in relief] Yeah! Oh, Dad! You were so right, Dad! I knew he had to go, but sheesh. Now he's just showing off. [elevator dings] [sighs] That family. Always around, always getting in my way. Goodbye, Big City. - [tow-truck beeping] - Hey, hey! Wait! [tow-truck beeping] No, stop! That's all I have, please, stop! [gasps] Sir, move aside! I'm sorry, I can't let you tow this car. Heck no, we won't be towed! Heck no, we won't be towed! - ♪ Do do do do do do do do ♪ - [tire hissing] Move it, or I'll tow you too! - For glory and Gloria! - [grunting] [laughing] - [drives groaning] - [tires screeching] Yeah, that's right, bye-bye! You guys, that was amazing! I-I can't believe you did that for me. Well, we know what it's like losing a car with everything you own in it. Happened to use when we moved here. We got your back, Gloria. Yeah, you're never alone. You have us! I can't believe I even had to explain that to you. Thanks. I guess I never thought of it that way. Well, since you're leaving, you probably wanna hit the road. Or... - [doorbell rings] - Hey, pizza's here. So, that's two large pizzas and four Mega Gulp Tubby Punches. - What? - I ordered those! [grunts] Hand them right over here. Yeah, I'll take them. So what are you guys gonna drink? Thanks so much for helping me unpack. - Of course! - Happy to help! I'll bill you later. [neighbor] Hey, quiet down over there! No, you quiet down! [neighbor] Oh, uh, sorry. Got your back, Gloria.
