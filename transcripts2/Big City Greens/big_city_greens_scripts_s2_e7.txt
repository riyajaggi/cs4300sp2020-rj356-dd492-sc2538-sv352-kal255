 ♪♪ ♪ One, two One, two, three ♪ Citizens of Big City! There is a severe heat warning in effect! For your safety, please remain indoors. Unless, of course, you are required to patrol the streets while your colleagues all go on a group trip to the beach. Ha ha! How unlucky for me! I'm so sticky! Yeah, and I'm not feeling any air from this fan. Heh heh. Nancy, you'll have to pry my breezy body off this thing.

 I certainly would, but... heat. Eh. Tilly, how come you're not dying like the rest of us? It's quite simple, brother. I think of cold stuff. Just imagine some ice on your head. And in your heart. And in your bones. Until your soul itself becomes a frozen wasteland. Brr! Bill, got an ETA on the new A/C? Almost ready! This top-of-the-line unit was on clearance for some reason. How lucky for us!

 Hello, Green family! Remy's here! Oh, hey, Remy, didn't hear you over the TV. Cricket, you ready for a little game of HORSE? Uh, I'm not sure if it's a good idea for you boys to play out in the heat. But Mr. Green! - We have a rivalry to uphold! - Rivalry? We compete just like the two famous basketball players, Ricky Stork and Wizard Williams. Their fierce on-court rivalry was the stuff of legends. But no matter who won or lost, they were always the best of friends. Come on, little buddy. Actually, bud, I'm siding with the big guy on this one. It's just too hot to play today. Well, with you forfeiting, I guess that means... - I win! - Huh? I said, if you forfeit... I... win. Hm. Oh, Remy! Remy. I've beaten you 47 times in a row. And no amount of heat will ever stop that streak. Besides, how hot can it really be? Oh, my gravy. Ah, the ol' Green family hoop. The "Rusted Lady" herself. It's so hot! Ha ha, yeah, well, it's a dry heat. Hup! You're up, Cricket! Holy toot, I'm getting broiled out here! How is Remy getting through this heat? I mean, he's wearing a cashmere sweater! Gotta be twice as hot as me. I just gotta outlast him. He'll wilt like a flower. He'll melt like an ice cube. He'll... Hey, you gonna keep wilting like a flower, or are you gonna step up and play HORSE? I wanna play HORSE! OK. Ah, gol dang it... Sah-wish! Heh! Oh, that's an "H" for you. Go, Remy! I don't get it! I'm over here dying and you're not even breaking a sweat! - How? - Who knows? Maybe it's not as hot as you think it is! Huh? OK, the manual suggests starting this thing at "room temperature." No! Room temperature is for airports and toilet water! Crank it! Yeesh, OK! Heh heh, touchscreen. OK, that's as cold as she goes. Ahh... Ah, that's the stuff. Very refreshin'. I hate to say this, but maybe it's a little too cold? Yeah! Make it hotter! Okie-doke. Um... Uh-oh, my finger's too cold. Hey, Tilly, could you maybe try... Ooh... that can't be good. Hup! Swish, baby! My win streak's goin' bust! This is the end of an era. Everything dies eventually, right? Hmm. Hey, Remy, why is this ball so sticky? Sticky? Hee! Hey, pal, come here for a second! Oh, uh, maybe we should go back to... Sure, sure, in a minute. Uh, Cricket... It's OK, easy now, I just wanna see somethin'! I knew it! Popsicle vest! That's how you've been staying cool. All this time you've been a boy-sicle! Well, I, uh... A boy-sicle! No, I... A boy-sicle! It's just... Cricket, I've lost every game of HORSE we've ever played! Heh heh! Yeah, you love losing! What?! No! No one likes losing! I don't like losing so much that I covered myself in popsicles! OK, OK, just settle yourself. I'll tell you what, you take off the ice cream and we'll play for real. Mm, what if I just wear the part around my middle, like a cummerbund? Uh, now what, may I ask, is a cummerbund? It's like a sash that you tie around your waist when you're wearing a dinner jacket or a tuxedo. Its origins are Persian, actually! Oh, well, that is interesting, but I will say... Oh, wow, who turned up the oven? Ohh! Oh! Jeepers creepers! Oh, raspberries! This complicates things! How 'bout it, Cricket? Forfeit now and we can get out of this heat. No! Never! We'll adapt! We'll just have to play... Street HORSE. Son. Hey, son! Son! Aw, nuts. Brr! OK, bad news, I couldn't get the boys' attention, and all the windows and doors are frozen shut. So, how's everyone doing with this refreshing cool air? Yeah, not great, Bill. What's the plan here? Well, we used all the blankets and coats. We could light a fire in the fireplace, but we've got no wood. Uh, what about your carvings? They're wood. What?! I don't think things are that desperate. Seriously? We're freezing our faces off! Gotta stop the cold thoughts. Only hot thoughts. I'm visualizing fire, electric blankets, mercury a'risin'... Oh, no, what's that over there, a snowman? On an ice floe? No, I don't want to join you! No! No! You keep warm, sweetheart. Hey, Alice, you look... ...cold. I gave all the coats to Tilly, but do you want to share the bathrobe with me? What's the catch? Since you're asking, I want you to apologize for hoggin' the fan earlier. I'd rather freeze. Alice, that's macabre, you're going to scare Tilly. She can't hear nothin', she's lost in her brain. No, Mr. Penguin, I'm too young for iced coffee! That's like the eighth pigeon I've seen faint. You nervous? No way, man, you were cheatin'! That's put the fire of competition in my belly! Oh, gosh, don't say fire. Remy, the rules are simple. In Street HORSE, the whole city is our basket! Shut up! OK. Doin' a kick shot off the hydrant... over the traffic light... into that open manhole! Ow! Come on, it's too hot! OK. Kick shot over the, uh... Guys! Aah! Hot pavement, hot pavement! Hyah! Uh, "Croblins 4." Gonna, gonna throw it... gonna throw it into the horseman's lap. Give me your little shoes, man, my foot pads are broilin'. No. Why won't you give me your shoes! No. OK! Backswopp the hoop and in the hole. You about ready to had enough? You better not believe it. Remy, this might be it for me. I... huh? Oh, my sweet flamin' banjo... Ricky Stork and... Wizard Williams! What?! Please, children, calm yourselves. We've come to share with you an important lesson. Is it about over-competitiveness? And the value of friendship? No. We just came to tell you to get out of the sun. It's too hot! Remy, they're saying we got so caught up in the heat of competing, we forgot that our competition was built on a beautiful friendship. No, you're not listening. I forfeit the game! Here you go, buddy. My win streak is over. This victory is yours. Thanks, Cricket. But I refuse your forfeit! I can win this on my own merit! Whoa. Come on, you... He's doin' it. Yes! Yeah! That's my friend! Huh? Thank you, Ricky Stork. Thank you, Wizard Williams. You saved our friendship! Uh-oh! Huh? Ahh... Oh, good, you're back. Your dad's getting the fire going. Papa, your wood carvings! You're the only little carving I need. All right, I give in. Get in here, ya li'l ice block. Ahh. Sorry... for hoggin' the fan. Well, well, well. I cannot believe that - Alice Green just apolog... - Shh, shh. Snuggle time. Doesn't look like the fire is catchin'. Got any more carvings, Bill? Just one. Part of me dies with you. Hot, hot, hot! No time for the doorknob! Unwarranted Hero Kick! Whoa! Ahh... Ahh... Mr. Fish! Oh! Thank goodness. Wowie! The temperature in here is just perfect!
