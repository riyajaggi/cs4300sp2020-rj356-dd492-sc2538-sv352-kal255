 SHE HUMS
 DOG BARKS
 ~ Tidn't right.
~ Tidn't fair.
 ~ Tidn't fit.
~ Tidn't proper.
 ~ Won't last.
~ Won't work.
 ~ Who'd she think she is?
~ Who'd 'ee think she is?
 'Chit of a girl.'
 ~ She'll be too grand t'skivvy.
~ Too common t' curtsey.
 'Tis all cocky-eyed.
 DOG BARKS
 He's late t'night, Garrick.
 Mm? Where can he be?
 SHE MUMBLES TO HERSELF
 ~ HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
~ Sir!
 Ross.
 I was thinking 'ee might
stop over in town.
 I have a home, do I not? And a wife?
 I do sometimes forget.
 ~ That I live here?
~ That I'm your wife.
 Let this be a reminder.
 ~ Why are you up so late?
~ I 'ave chores.
 ~ Suppose I have other plans for you?
~ Tell me.
 Yes, Ross.
 Folks'll wonder.
 ~ They'll not understand.
I don't rightly understand.
~ What?
 How it came t'happen - this. We.
 You're not required to understand.
 You're required to accept
it as a fact of life.
 So it's not t'be a secret?
 Why should it?
 Good day, ladies. Are
we expecting a storm?
 ~ Storm o'pilchards, God willin'!
~ They're late this year.
 An we d'fear they miss'd us entire
an' swung away t'Ireland.
 If that happens you'll have nothing
to see you through winter.
 ~ An' we'll starve.
~ Simple as that.
 Let's hope it won't come to that.
 I'm not a magician, sir! I cannot
conjure wages out of thin air!
 The men must wait.
 ~ Did my father send you?
~ Why would he?
 Read me the riot act, tell
me what I'm doing wrong?
 Or was it my wife?
 Does she think I'm falling
short of the mark?
 Is she wrong to be concerned?
 ~ What she doesn't know, won't hurt her.
~ What she suspects, might.
 Gaming? Whoring? What gentleman
doesn't occasionally indulge?
 ~ This one.
~ Since when?
~ Since my wedding.
 SHE HUMS TO HERSELF
 'Your kitchen maid?'
 But, Ross, surely you must see...
 With such a wife you cannot hope
 to have entry into any
respectable gathering.
 You will cut yourself out of
society, consign yourself to...
 A life of peace and seclusion?
 I must try to bear it as best I can.
 May I leave you to share the
glad tidings at Trenwith?
 Demelza?
 Damn me, he's done it now!
 What the devil can he mean by it?
 I never thought you
the marrying kind.
 Is she wealthy?
 ~ Not at all.
~ 'Could've had his pick.'
 Any number of eligible girls
from rising families.
 Instead of which... he
marries his serving wench.
 ~ It beggars belief.
~ It may beggar him.
 He must be deranged.
 How else could he lower
his sights so abominably?
 Is she beautiful?
 In a way.
 In spite of our assets, we Warleggans
struggle to pass muster.
 How will he fare with a
scullery maid on his arm?
 'His family with never forgive him.'
 Society will never forgive him.
 'Doors which were open will
be slammed in his face.'
 His ventures will fail...
 and you can enjoy the sight of him
in the gutter along with his slut.
 So you love her?
 We get on.
 "My dear Ross, I am the last person
to criticise your attachment.
 "But I would like to be the first
to write to you and wish you joy..."
 ".. I am presently taken
up with tending Father
 "but I hope soon to call to offer
my felicitations in person."
 There. We have at least one friend.
 "Callin'"? Who 'as time to call?
 What they mean by it - "callin'".
 Callin'.
 What?
 'Ee bin givin' me squinny-eye ever
since I got back from church.
 'Ow else we mun look? We don't
rightly know 'oo we lookin' at!
 One minute she Miss Skivvily-
Scullery-Kitchen-Maid,
 the next she be Mistress
'Igh n' Mighty!
 Do 'ee think it's not as strange
to me as it is to you?
 Do 'ee imagine I ever looked
for or 'spected it?
 ~ Come to think of it, 'tis
more your fault than mine!
~ 'Ow be that, then?
 'Tis you 'ave raised me up
an' taught me all I know.
 So if I'm fit for better
than I'd 'oped,
 blame 'ee'selves for eddycatin' me!
 ~ We?
~ Eddycators?
 ~ We made 'er what she is.
~ She 'ave we a' thank ferrit.
 ~ She still do all her chores.
~ An' most o' yourn.
~ An' 'tis better'n
 takin' orders from some fudgy-faced
baggage wi' drop-curls!
 Damn this ironstone,
is there no end to it?
 How long till we strike copper?
 IF we strike copper
- it could be months.
 ~ Can we last?
~ With good will and good men.
 ~ And the power of luck beside.
~ We'll need a rise in the price of ore.
 Else we're all wastin' our time.
 ~ This shareholders meetin'...
~ Not a prospect I relish.
 We're no closer to copper, so I
must appeal for further investment
 if we're to keep blasting.
 But - are they not friends o' yourn?
 If ever they were, they're
reconsidering the connection.
 I would that I had nothing better
to do than admire the view!
 They'd happily swap
places with you, sir.
 You have means to last the winter.
Without the pilchards, they do not.
 Those who cannot feed,
should not breed.
 I believe felicitations are in order.
 Your son John? Recently wed.
 To Miss Ruth Teague.
A determined girl.
 ~ My best wishes to them both.
~ But are we not remiss
 overlooking the presence of
a bridegroom in our midst?
 Oh, yes - indeed, indeed.
 Congratulations, Captain Poldark,
you have our best wishes for you
 ~ and your young bride.
~ I thank you, gentlemen.
 Now, if you'll excuse me,
 I must consult Captain Henshawe
before our meeting.
 I confess myself uneasy.
 His early skirmishes with the law,
 his contempt of court
at the last assizes...
 and now this marriage
to his serving wench.
 ~ You think him foolish?
~ I think him reckless in the extreme.
 Is a man that demonstrates such
spectacular lack of judgment
 to be trusted? Is he fit to helm
a venture of such risk as a mine?
 More to the point,
 am I prepared to trust him
with more of my capital?
 I am not, sir.
 I can see no reason for pouring
good money after bad.
 Come to me when you've struck
copper and I may reconsider.
 Till then you'll see no
more of me or my guineas.
 The rest of you share his opinion?
 I do not.
 Nor do I.
 Gentlemen, thank you. I'm sorry we
could not bring you better reports.
 You got the candles an' twine?
An' muslin for the cheese?
 Open it.
 A book for you.
 To practise your letters.
 And ribbons to tie
up that unruly mane.
 I know little of these things.
 If they don't suit,
give them to Prudie.
 ~ Did I mention I wrote to your father?
~ Oh, Ross, ye never!
 He'll be that vexed, thinkin'
I'm never comin' 'ome.
 I told him your duty lay here.
 So it do, Ross. Nothin's changed.
 Nothing?
 I d'get less sleep!
 ~ That's your only complaint?
~ I 'ave no complaints.
 I do, however.
 ~ Tell me.
~ You have yet to make an
official visit to the mine.
 ~ Oh, no, Ross - I couldn't.
'Ow would it look?
~ "Look"?
 ~ A kitchen maid givin' 'erself airs.
~ I see no kitchen maid.
 I see a wife whose duty is to take
an interest in her husband's work.
 ~ I do take an interest!
~ Excellent. First thing tomorrow, then.
 Harder, dammit. Push harder.
 Is this wise, sir? Can Grambler
not wait till you're stronger?
 ~ Dr Choake ordered bed-rest.
~ Dr Choake doesn't have a failing mine
 or a son who's neither
use nor ornament!
 I'm touched by your faith, Father.
 Not sufficiently touched to behave
like a man and the heir of Trenwith?
 HE GROANS IN PAIN
 ~ Father!
~ Father!
 I never knew such ironstone.
It's impenetrable.
 Our luck has deserted us.
 Let's 'ope the pilchards
don't do likewise.
 Mining and fishing is our lifeblood.
Surely both won't fail.
 Captain Henshawe, you
know my wife Demelza?
 ~ A pleasure to see you, ma'am.
~ G'day to 'ee, sir.
 ~ No sight 'o th' shoals yet.
~ Demelza's of mining stock herself.
 Her father's a tributer at Illuggan.
 Perhaps you'd like him
to join us here, ma'am?
 I'd as lief stick a fork in my eye!
 Um...we d'get on better
from a distance, sir.
 I must be gettin' back.
 ~ The pies'll be burnin'.
~ Right.
 We hope to see you here often, ma'am.
 ~ I was that worried I'd show 'ee up!
~ Why would you?
 ~ I've no notion how to be.
~ As you are.
 ~ What am I?
~ A lady.
~ I'm not - an' I don't know 'ow.
 You're a quick learner.
 Nay, Ross, I came a'day at your behest,
but I shan't venture again.
 Miners are my own kind - but I'd
not be so kindly received by yours.
 Judas! I'll fetch
'im such a doostin'!
 ~ Demelza!
~ Oi! Guts!
~ Demelza!
 Get back 'ere, you
good-fer-nothin' viper!
 Thievin', connivin'...
 'Alf a morn I labour'd
at that pie, y'lizard!
 ~ Demelza, leave him be!
~ Think to fox me, would 'ee?
 'Ee'll 'ave to be quicker 'n that!
 Damn me if a man can't take
a fair morsel now 'n then.
 ~ I told you to stop. Did you not hear me?
~ Yes, but...
 I cannot have my wife wrestling
a manservant. It's unbecoming.
 No, Ross.
 I see it is not dignified.
 ~ I'll remember next time.
~ There'll be no next time.
 There's only one way to remind
you you're no longer a servant.
 ~ But you'll do all th' arrangin'?
~ I will not.
 You are mistress of Nampara. It's
for you to engage your own servants.
 I'll serve 'ee gladly, ma'am.
When shall 'ee want me?
 ~ Tomorrow'd be quite convenient.
~ Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.
 'She curtsey'd to me.'
 Get used to it.
 ~ No, I never will.
~ I must visit my uncle.
 ~ Perhaps it's time for you to come with me.
~ No...
 No, I cud'n't. There's
calves t'be meated,
 ~ an' pastry t'make...
~ From tomorrow, that excuse won't avail you!
 KNOCK ON DOOR
 How does the patient fare?
 Lucky to have any blood left.
 Progress is excellent.
 If he continues with my treatment,
 he can expect to eat a
hearty Christmas dinner!
 But how will you manage, Ross,
 without a kitchen-maid?
 My wife has, this very
day, engaged another.
 HE LAUGHS
 The cheek of the devil!
 But your father was no different!
 The Nampara Poldarks were renowned
for their disregard of convention.
 Good day to you.
 We're so delighted by the news, Ross.
 ~ Francis, especially, was
quick to see the advantage!
~ Father.
 ~ Of what?
~ A wife to divert you!
 He feels it marginally less
likely that you'll ride over
 and steal Elizabeth from him!
 ~ HE LAUGHS
~ Father!
 ~ Compose yourself.
~ HE LAUGHS HEARTILY
 HE GROANS IN PAIN My heart! My heart!
 ~ Fetch the doctor.
~ Damn Choake promised me Christmas dinner!
 He's asked to see you.
 I've lost all faith
 in this world of ours...
 .. and my legacy.
 ~ We both know Francis is not the man you are.
~ Uncle...
 Look after him for me.
 ~ Of course.
~ And our family.
 And our good name.
 You have my word.
 BELL TOLLS IN DISTANCE
 He'll be missed.
 Not by me.
 Is it terrible to feel
nothing but relief?
 ~ Nothing I ever did pleased him.
~ Not even your choice of wife?
 He always said she would make
a fine mistress of Trenwith.
 And I, an indifferent master.
 ~ You can still prove him wrong.
~ Now I've come into my estate?
 Half of it's mortgaged, the
other half soon will be.
 But apparently now...
 I'm one of the most important
men in the county.
 How is it 'ee be not at the buryin'?
 'Tis for fancy folks an' family
- not for the likes of me.
 Are ye not family?
 Ross might say so.
 But I know 'tis not my place.
 What is your place?
 Betwixt an' between.
 Neither one nor t'other.
 You need more flour,
stops it from sticking.
 See?
 I warned Charles. Too many
capons and custards.
 Look at me - poached
egg, a little broth -
 fit as a fiddle!
 Fitter than Francis
by the look of it.
 Grambler must be taking its toll.
 Not to mention a young morsel
by the name of Margaret.
 Have you dined there yourself lately?
 My tastes are more
refined these days.
 Are you not coming down?
 I really cannot face it.
 Nor I, but one of us
must play the hostess.
 She didn't come.
 His wife.
 This isn't the occasion.
 ~ Will you give him my good wishes?
~ Shouldn't you do that yourself?
 I wouldn't know where to begin.
 "Unwell"? And not even the thought
of a tete-a-tete with Ross
 ~ could persuade her?
~ Francis...
 She'll have few opportunities with
Mistress Poldark to amuse him.
 ~ You must be relieved.
~ How?
 You're not the only one
to disgrace the family
 ~ by an unsuitable attachment.
~ Francis!
 Consider yourself fortunate.
See what you've missed.
 ~ Dr Choake.
~ Mm? Mm.
 I've puzzled you out.
 Was I so hard to fathom?
 Well, I thought so, but your recent
nuptials have made everything clear.
 It delights you to thumb
your nose at society,
 because you consider yourself above
the niceties by which it operates.
 Not above. Just indifferent.
 ~ Are you pleased with Wheal Leisure?
~ Pray do not mention it to me.
 Mining's always a gamble.
 And the gamester rarely
meets a Good Samaritan.
 As in?
 Oh, someone willing to take
a worthless bet off his hands.
 But should I hear of anyone,
 would you be interested?
 What have I told you?
 I don't require my wife
to crochet and sip tea,
 but I do require her to remember
she's not a beast of burden.
 ~ Are you happy?
~ I am.
~ Then I hope you'll be even more so
 when I tell you who's coming to stay.
 ROSS: Come on through.
 It's so kind of you
to invite me, my dear.
 Would you care for some refreshment?
 Oh, no, please! Let me
take care of myself.
 ~ The last thing I want is
to give you any trouble.
~ No trouble at all.
 We've been looking forward to
your visit. Haven't we, Demelza?
 Yes, Ross.
 It's a quiet house since father died.
 Though Elizabeth plays the harp and
speaks French to Geoffrey Charles.
 And I have my needlework.
Aunt Agatha her spinning.
 ~ And Francis?
~ Is...
 .. often away.
 This pie is delicious, my dear.
Did you bake it yourself?
 Custard! I'll go an' see if it's set.
 She thinks you a great
lady who will show me
 ~ what a mistake I made in marrying her.
~ What can I do?
 I'm sure you'll think of something.
 Ross! No! Where are you going?
 You cannot just - Ross!
 ~ Blasted copper. It's
proving a devil to find.
~ Blasting is the word.
 It seems to be our only hope.
 HAMMERS CLANG
 Right, boys.
 ~ Some tea?
~ Oh! Thank you!
 But no. It's a little early.
 Oh. Yes, so it is.
 Thank you, Jinny.
 You know, Ross is very dear to me.
 What woman should ever deserve
him, I couldn't imagine.
 ~ So when I heard he'd married you, I was...
~ Horrified.
~ .. relieved.
 Before he met you he was...
 .. broken. Lost.
 So I was relieved to think he'd
found someone to console him,
 to save him from his loneliness.
 But now I see it's
more than consolation.
 You've given him hope.
 A life without hope is bleak.
 ~ And a life without love...
~ Oh, 'tis not that.
 ~ You do not...?
~ Love 'im?
 Beyond anythin'.
 But...
 I could never hope that... that he...
 That he would ever...
 He's kind to me.
 And when we're abed...
 I 'ave reason to think
I do please 'im.
 Oh, I'm sure you do.
 But I'd never call it love.
 Ee's never used that word t'me and...
 I misdoubt 'ee ever shall.
 It's life's greatest
treasure to love.
 And be loved in return.
 My dear, do you think I care
a jot where you come from,
 or who your father is,
or how well you curtsey?
 I of'en wished I could curtsey.
 Will you teach me, Verity?
 DISTANT EXPLOSION
 THEY CHUCKLE
 The left, left, left!
 Well, make up yer blasted
blatherin' minds!
 What in God's name are you doing?
 We thought we should
move it into the parlour
 so Demelza may learn to dance.
 If you ladies would give us leave?
 Dip. One, two, three...
 Dip.
 Dip. One, two, three.
 On your tip-toes.
 One, two, three. Dip...
 Foot behind.
 One, two, three. Step.
 Slowly...
 And dip... One, two, three.
 That man who used
to meet Verity here?
 ~ Captain Blamey?
~ Has nothin' bin heard of 'im?
 Thankfully, no.
 ~ Oh, Ross, the shame on you!
~ What do you mean?
 ~ How could you let 'em part like that?
~ What the devil could I do?
 You should've stood up t'yer uncle.
 Even now in 'er heart she
still hankers for 'im.
 Then she must stop.
 Why should she?
 Must hope be buried?
 An' love denied?
 What do you know of love?
 ~ A little.
~ Is that all?
 Then you must practice more.
 Must you go home tomorrow?
 Francis needs me.
 But I'll come again soon.
 ~ Did you really hate it today?
~ Oh, no!
 I'm just afeared we spent too much
money and 'twill all be wasted.
 ~ How could it?
~ Only that...
 p'raps my measuring might
not be the same for long.
 My dear, do you mean...?
 ~ Oh, Ross will be delighted!
~ Don' tell 'im! Not yet. See..
 ee's not liked me fer long.
 And when I get to waddlin'
about like an old duck,
 ~ he might forget he ever liked me at all.
~ Ross forgets nothing.
 If we are to find copper
it's now or not at all.
 Come to watch us set our final fuse?
 Will one more blast get us through?
 One more blast is all we can afford.
 MINE BELL TOLLS
 MAN SHOUTS
 BELL CONTINUES RINGING
 ~ I heard the bell! What's amiss?
~ We must leave at once.
 Quickly!
 ~ What is it?
~ Nothin', sir.
 Ross. Just...
 ~ What's the matter?
~ Sometimes...
 I d'think I displease you.
 I'm used to giving orders and having
no-one to suit but myself,
 but you are far from
displeasing to me.
 ~ See, how would I know that?
~ I'll endeavour to make it clearer.
 We must go. Make haste!
 Where are we going?
 CHEERING
 ~ Good catch, eh, Mark?
~ 'Andsome, Ross.
 More than a quarter of a million,
they reckon, afore they're done.
 I'm very glad. It'll make
the difference this winter.
 ~ 'Twill indeed! Night, Ross. Night, ma'am.
~ Night, Mark.
 MAN: Night, Ross. Night, ma'am.
 ~ Night, Ross. Night, ma'am.
~ Night.
 Everyone's happy tonight.
 They like you.
 ~ Nonsense.
~ 'Tis the truth. I should
know - I'm one of 'em.
 You're a gent.
 You don't despise 'em, you help 'em.
 You give 'em food, an' work, an...
 ~ Marry you.
~ No, not that.
 They don' know what t'make o'that.
 But they like you jus' the same.
 And you?
 Do you like me?
 I could learn to.
 And I, you.
 We're still not through.
 ~ I could swear we're almost there.
~ But we're out of gunpowder.
 Capital. Investors. How
long can we continue?
 An optimist would
say... three months?
 ~ And a realist?
~ Two.
 I must find more investment.
 It gives me no pleasure to tell
you this, but capital's short.
 ~ I understand.
~ Though I've kept my ear to the ground...
 ~ in case other speculators could be found.
~ And?
 Tom Choake has done
you no favours, Ross.
 ~ His views on your marriage...
~ "Ross Poldark, the loose cannon.
 "Too much of a risk for
the prudent investor."
 ~ I blame myself.
~ You couldn't foresee as we'd 'it such rock.
 But I could foresee that
in marrying my kitchen maid,
 I'd scandalise all I might
look to for capital.
 Well, short of jilting her
and wedding a rich heiress...
 Perhaps I was over-hasty.
 But it's done now.
 So how shall we order things?
 We can last till the
week before Christmas.
 Let it be the week after.
 If I have to sell half my house,
I'll not ruin Christmas for them.
