 We come here today to decide
 whether to risk good gold
in pursuit of copper.
 You are a disgrace to
the name of Poldark.
 I need to work, Ross. Or my
mother and sisters starve.
 ~ Who is that man?
~ Captain Blamey?
 When may I see you again?
 Filthy skunk! Claims
to be a gentleman.
 Let him step outside and prove it!
 Fetch me some water!
 More than ever, I need
him well and at my side.
 I'm with child.
 Goodbye, Verity.
 He enticed my daughter away.
 I offer you the chance
to return to your home,
 ~ if that's where you feel you belong.
~ I belong here.
 I thought this day would never come.
 Expectations are high.
 Pray God we don't disappoint them.
 Aye.
 A pleasant change -
to see a mine opening!
 For how long, I wonder?
 My friends, when my father
closed this mine 20 years ago,
 he little thought it
would have a future.
 Today, with your help,
labour and good wishes,
 we aim to prove him wrong.
 Gentlemen, ladies, I declare
the Wheal Leisure Mine open.
 'Tis a grand thing 'ee done, Ross.
 Thank you, Ross!
 ~ Zacky. Mark.
~ Can't thank 'ee enough.
 Then don't. If all goes well,
it's I who'll be thanking you.
 Sir...
 Thank you.
 I'm that glad, sir!
 For the miners an' their
families - an' for 'ee, sir!
 My neck's on the line.
Are you glad about that?
 Oh, no, sir! What shall
I do if it come to grief?
 Are the rumours true, do you think?
 He's a damned fool if they're not!
 I take it you've forgiven him?
 He saved your life.
 Time for you to demonstrate
it wasn't wasted.
 I've no mine to resurrect.
 You have one to keep alive!
 Start by stemming the leakage
of workers from our mine to his!
 That is easier said than done.
 Our wages are hardly
an incentive to stay.
 We will have iron ladders
down the main shaft.
 ~ Iron?
~ Wood rots.
 It'll cost you.
 Better me than a man's life.
 Two shafts have been sunk,
but it's hard going.
 We struck ironstone almost at once.
 ~ We may yet require gunpowder.
~ More expense?
 Aye, but don't be discouraged.
 Where there's ironstone,
there's often copper.
 There. You mark that?
 Chase that and we'll
hope to catch copper.
 Judas! I can hear 'ee kickin'
up a dido three mile away!
 ~ 'Tis this great buffle 'ead!
~ Hush yer creenin', woman!
 You'd think cheese
wouldn't choke 'ee!
 Be she who started it!
 Mr Ross's rum again?
 He won't miss it! His 'ead
be fair full 'o the mine.
 He's gone an' breaked me arm!
 Let's see.
 'Tis only a sprain -
 but 'ee'll not be fit to cook
vittles this three week.
 'Ee mun' step into th' breach, then!
 It's all right, child -
Prudie'll instruct 'ee.
 Talk o' the blind leadin' the blind!
 Don't just stand there -
 brew us a dish o' tea while
I rest me broken wing!
 ~ Ross, have 'ee got a minute?
~ By all means.
 Young Jim...
 What's he been up to now?
 My Jinny.
 Poaching's a capital offence.
 Believe me, I'm acquainted
with the niceties of the law.
 'Tis not for my sake, Ross, 'tis
for me mother an' sisters.
 ~ I can't see 'em starve.
~ And Jinny?
 Sir?
 Is her welfare of equal
concern to you?
 Her father tells me
she is with child.
 Yes, sir, an' I mean to do right
by 'er when I can afford it.
 Dammit, man, the girl's frantic!
Why didn't you come to me before?
 Why, Ross, but what could 'ee do?
 It wants some small repairs.
 But nothin' a' pay?
 You'd be doing me a favour,
keeping it clean and dry.
 'Tis more than we could
ever 'ave hoped.
 Well, then, that's settled.
 So, now what's your excuse?
 Sir?
 Don't keep the girl waiting!
 Be off to her father -
and while you're at it,
 see Reverend Odgers about
getting the banns read.
 And get rid of those nets.
Let's have no more poaching.
 So, Prudie's recovery
may take some time.
 Happen a month or so, sir.
 Have her delay it
as long as possible.
 I wish you could forget him, my dear.
 Is love so easy to forget?
 Forgive me.
 I didn't mean... I didn't
mean to suggest...
 Mrs Tabb, send for Dr Choake.
 I wonder you do not think of
marriage, Captain Poldark?
 I dare say I shall, in due course.
 Always remembering the purpose
for which it was ordained?
 In particular...?
 As a remedy against sin.
 And to avoid fornication.
 ~ We can't thank 'ee enough.
~ Any man would do the same.
 "Any man" would not.
 ~ The only son.
~ An' since his father bit the dust...
 There's next to nothing
coming into the household.
 A grandson!
 The line continues.
 Well done, my boy!
 Thank Elizabeth. She did the work.
 Ah, women! They make a
song and dance about it,
 but if things are properly managed...
 A new Poldark!
 A letter...
 A letter come from Trenwith.
 Francis and Elizabeth have a son.
 Ah! Ross.
 We were just saying,
any man opening a mine
 these days must be exceptionally
brave or extremely foolish!
 How so?
 In these dire economic times...
 Which might be less dire, were
they not in the hands of those
 whose only purpose
is to make a profit.
 What other purpose is there?
 Perhaps you should ask those
who exist on starvation wages.
 Perhaps if you fraternised
less with the lower orders,
 you'd feel their woes less keenly.
 One does feel that the gentry
 and the vulgars should
keep to themselves.
 Otherwise it just gets so confusing.
 Good day.
 Have we been introduced? I seem
to recall you're related to me(!)
 Forgive me, Aunt. I've had much
to attend to of late. How are you?
 How should I be, with Mistress
Glumps for company?
 Verity is well rid of
that scoundrel, Blamey.
 I trust you've learnt the
folly of interference?
 It won't be repeated,
I assure you, Uncle.
 What do you make of my grandson?
 Please...
 A fine-looking boy, is he not?
 Like his father.
 ~ And his mother?
~ I congratulate you both.
 Please.
 Ah, George...
 You look pale.
 I've been stronger.
 I'd hoped you'd be named godfather.
 But Francis and George are
inseparable these days.
 Look at Geoffrey Charles!
 He's smiling at you!
 I can't imagine why!
 Elizabeth?
 Ladies and gentlemen.
 This is a proud day for the Poldarks.
 Behold, the future - Geoffrey
Charles Poldark,
 heir to the great Trenwith estate.
 And when I have taken
leave of this world
 and Francis has taught
the boy all he knows...
 (That shouldn't take long.)
 .. our great Poldark dynasty
 will continue and...
 ~ This wind... Damn me!
~ Dr Choake, quickly!
 Father!
 Carry him through. Come on.
 On a Christening day?
 And the child named after him?
 'Tis a sign, mark my words.
 Of course, a gentleman knows
where to draw the line.
 Towards a lady of his own class,
 his intentions should
be strictly honourable.
 Towards a woman of the
lower class, however...
 Oh, indeed, it's all very
disagreeable, but men are men.
 We paid a call some months ago.
 There was the hussy - already
beginning to put on airs.
 I saw her riding to
church, bold as brass,
 ~ all fligged up in her scarlet cloak!
~ It's too bad!
 It tarnishes the family name
 and my Elizabeth will
undoubtedly suffer...
 Proof, if proof were needed,
 that Ross Poldark is no gentleman.
 Good night, my darling boy.
 My poor wife, neglected as usual.
 How is your father?
 Rallying.
 Despite Choake's efforts!
 You look very lovely, my dear.
 Perhaps another night, I
still feel a little weak.
 You seemed most... animated
this afternoon.
 Hmm? With Ross.
 That's hardly fair.
 "Oh, Ross, look at my baby.
See how he smiles at you.
 "Don't you wish he was yours?"
 How can you say that?!
 Of course.
 Ross would never even
think such a thing.
 No, I'm sure he would not!
 Listening at key-holes?
 I've been tending to Father.
 No doubt you take Elizabeth's side.
 Against whom?
 Or Ross's!
 I take no-one's side.
 Had it been left to him, you
would be in Falmouth now,
 living with that scoundrel
in shame and misery.
 I don't regard marriage as misery.
 That's because you have
yet to experience it.
 (For which I have you to thank.)
 (Jim?)
 'Jim's a good man,'
 and it's good he should want
to provide for his family,
 but not with poaching.
 It's too dangerous.
 Could 'ee maybe ask Captain
Ross to tell him to stop?
 Mr Ross? Can I speak to 'ee, sir?
 Mr Ross, sir?
 Sir?
 Mr Ross?
 "Wee-al...
 "Weel... Well...
 "Wheal...
 "Leesh... Lie-sur."
 Demelza?
 Cap'n Poldark, sir? Do 'ee need me?
 A heart stroke?
 But Choake says you'll recover.
 Choake's a fool.
 And I am not immortal.
 So, this is your chance.
 To do what?
 Step up to the mark.
 You do recall we have a mine?
 Yes, but...
 It requires presence -
 direction, leadership.
 Yours.
 Yours!
 I know little of...
 Learn - fast.
 If your cousin continues
to pay decent wages,
 we'll soon have no-one
left at Grambler.
 Take a leaf out of
your cousin's book.
 'Does he keep his distance?
 'Does he watch from afar?
 'Or does he roll up his sleeves
and toil alongside his men?'
 Good day to you all.
 'Which do you think will
yield the better result?'
 How much longer do you
think before we eat?
 And perhaps if there's some bread...
 And maybe some...
 .. ale.
 Have you eaten?
 I do sometimes forget to, sir.
 Eat now.
 Sit.
 You've finished the lower field?
 Yes, sir. And tomorrow I
be startin' on the meadow.
 You get through more in a
day than Prudie in a month!
 I be young, sir. And strong...
 And not bone idle.
 I heard Jinny was over. How is she?
 In truth, sir,
 she's that worried.
 ~ About what?
~ Jim and his poachin'.
 I thought perhaps 'ee
could tell him to stop.
 I'll do more than that.
 I've a better job for him -
 assistant purser at the mine.
 Oh, Jinny'll be that glad!
 Why must 'ee go?
 We don't need nothin' more.
 Cap'n Poldark do give 'ee
work and this cottage and...
 'Tis not just for we, Jinny.
 Cap'n Poldark do help us,
 but I can't ask him to help
my mother and sisters.
 And since Father be gone,
 who else is going to put
bread in their mouths but I?
 She'd not wish 'ee to take such risk.
 There'll be no more after tonight.
 'Ee have my word.
 I won't be long.
 Y'know I love you.
 ~ Demelza, do we have any of that...?
~ Brandy, sir?
 Last of that hid in the
cupboard from France?
 Exactly so.
 ~ Anythin' else?
~ Yes. If you could somehow
avoid the inference
 that I'm utterly predictable?
 Yes, sir.
 I'll try, sir.
 Oi!
 I shouldn't have waited!
 I should have made him
the offer last night.
 What will 'ee do?
 Visit Sir Hugh Bodrugan,
the owner of the pheasants.
 Ross Poldark!
 Are you joining the hunt, sir?
 Thank you, no.
 But I would be grateful for
five minutes of your time.
 What can I do for you?
 The poacher taken last
night on your land.
 As magistrate, you'll have
hearing of the case.
 ~ He's an employee of mine.
~ Is he, by God.
 I would happily make good any loss
 if he could be let off
with a severe warning.
 Blast me, sir, he's on
his way to Truro gaol.
 ~ I had him committed for trial
at eight o'clock this morning.
~ You were in haste, sir.
 There was no time to lose
- the hunt starts at nine.
 It's a damned disgrace, the amount
of good game going lost of late.
 Hanging's barely good
enough for the villain!
 'They disgust me, my own class.'
 Not all of them, but... most.
 ~ How is it, sir, that 'ee be not like 'em?
~ Perhaps I am.
 No. No, sir. They don't
see us like you do.
 As folk with hurts and
feelings, same as they.
 Sometimes I fail to see
that, too, Demelza.
 Sometimes I barely see what's
right in front of me.
 He's just a lad, sir.
 They mun' sure let him go.
 You would think so.
 Is Jinny ready?
 She can't go, Ross. 'Tis 'er time.
 Bring him safe home, Ross.
 '.. Has been unemployed by you'
 in soliciting that pardon
from the Almighty
 which I trust your prayers may obtain
 through the merits of your redeemer,
 whose first attribute is mercy.
 It now only remains to me
 to pass the dreadful
sentence of the law,
 which is to transportation.
 Take him away.
 What was his crime?
 Poaching.
 A word, sir?
 Oh... Don't tell me.
More funds required?
 No, another matter entirely.
 You treated Jim Carter when
he worked at Wheal Reath?
 Convulsive asthma - a morbid
condition of the lungs.
 Did for his father, as I recall.
 Why do you ask?
 Only with evidence of ill health
and testament of good character,
 I'd hope we could get
the charge dismissed.
 Dismissed?!
 I doubt his lungs would
survive a stint in gaol.
 To be frank with you, sir, I've
no great sympathy for your aims.
 No good will come of being
sentimental about such folk.
 They're a different breed, sir.
 A different breed!
 Call James Carter!
 Will you join me?
 I have an estate to run.
 One game won't hurt.
 So, he was caught red-handed?
 And according to Sir Hugh,
 there's scarcely a pheasant
left in his woods.
 You may stand down.
 Is there any defence in this case?
 May I ask the indulgence
of the court?
 You have some evidence you wish
to give in this man's defence?
 I wish to give evidence
of his good character.
 He's my servant.
 Take the witness stand, sir.
 No doubt, on the evidence
you've heard,
 you will see nothing
exceptional in this case.
 In your long experience I'm sure
there are many such cases -
 especially in times when
hunger, poverty and sickness
 prevail amongst the poor.
 Keep to the matter in hand, sir.
 I've reason to believe that the
accused fell into bad company
 with an older man who has
so far escaped punishment.
 He has a wife...
 .. a mother and four
sisters to support.
 Evidence, sir? Pertaining
to the crime itself?
 I have it on the authority
of Dr Choake of Sawle
 that Jim Carter is suffering
from a chronic lung condition
 which may prove fatal.
 I myself am prepared to stand surety
 for his future employ
and good behaviour.
 Is it your contention, sir,
 that the prisoner is not in a fit
state of health to go to prison?
 It is, sir.
 And furthermore,
 this very day he will become
a father for the first time.
 The prisoner was ill
when he went poaching?
 He's been ill for some time.
 And his wife has been with
child "for some time"?
 It appears to me that if a man
is well enough to go poaching,
 he's well enough to take
the consequences -
 whether or not it adversely
affects his wife and child.
 And when 'ee get home,
 there be calves to be meated and...
 Who be this 'ere, then?
 That be the maid's father.
 What can he be wanting?
 So...
 'Ee be 'ere still?
 And content, too, Father.
 And I 'ope you are, too.
 Take a look at me, Daughter.
 What do 'ee see?
 What's happened?
 I be married.
 The Widow Chegwidden
have raised me up
 and brought me out to meet the Lord.
 Meanin' what?
 Meanin' farewell drink
and livin' in sin.
 We live a good life now, Daughter.
 And we be fixin' to have 'ee back.
 'Tis a fine woman
I've married, child.
 And we do think 'ee be better with we
 than stayin' 'ere exposed
to all temptations of...
 flesh and the devil.
 "Temptations"?!
 'Ee do know of what I speak.
 Confess, Daughter,
 what sin there is 'twixt
you and Poldark.
 There's no sin!
 He's my master and I'm his servant.
 And more besides, if tales be true.
 ~ What's it to me what folks say?
~ Nought to 'ee maybe,
 but I want no daughter of
mine mixed up in such talk!
 Since when were 'ee so tender of me?
 Since the Lord ope'd my
heart and shone His light!
 So I give 'ee a day to
make it right wi' Poldark,
 and then I'll be back here
again to fetch 'ee home.
 You paint a vivid picture of the
hardships endured by the poor, sir.
 Still,
 a man's need should not
determine his honesty,
 else all beggars would be thieves.
 However, in view of these
extenuating circumstances
 and your testimony of
Carter's good character,
 the court is prepared to
take a more lenient view.
 Sentenced to two years' imprisonment.
 Well, I trust I shall never
have the misfortune
 to have the "leniency" of
the court extended to me!
 Have a care, Mr Poldark.
 Such remarks are not entirely outside
the court's jurisdiction.
 No.
 Only mercy enjoys that privilege.
 One moment, sir.
 You take issue with
the laws of this land?
 I can't help but feel
that, in this case,
 justice would have been
best served by clemency.
 Happily for justice,
 this court is better able to
interpret the law than you.
 Then the law is savage and you
interpret it without charity!
 The book from which you preach
 says that man shall not
live by bread alone.
 These days you're asking him
to live without even that!
 Step down, Mr Poldark,
 or we'll have you committed
for contempt of court.
 I can assure you, such a committal
 would be an entirely accurate
reading of my thoughts.
 How can I go?
 I couldn't live nowhere else.
 Till I came, I never lived at all.
 I can't leave 'ere.
 (I can't leave him.)
 He'll make me go.
 He won't care.
 I'm not so important
to him as he is to me.
 Spare yourself the trouble, child,
 he'll not be 'ome tonight.
 What cheer, Captain Poldark?
 Precious little.
 I could remedy that.
 You could not.
 Nobody could.
 Then I shall take my consolation
where it's more appreciated.
 A Poldark, you say?
 Not a Poldark...
 Ooh!
 ..THE Poldark of Trenwith House.
 Oh, Lord bless you, sir.
What other Poldark is there?
 Let me out!
 Gaoler!
 It was more than good
of 'ee to try, Ross.
 Don't thank me, I failed miserably.
 Goodbye.
 Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.
 I can't leave him! I can't! I can't!
 I must.
 Demelza?
 Demelza!
 Demelza?
 Sir?
 Close the window.
 Yes, sir.
 Are Jud and Prudie abed?
 Yes, sir, long since.
 Fetch me the rum.
 Yes, sir.
 Jim Carter got two years.
 I feared it might be worse.
 I doubt he'll survive.
 'Ee did all 'ee could.
 Did I?
 I doubt it.
 I was too concerned
with my own dignity.
 Grovelling and compliments
were the order of the day,
 and I made the mistake of trying
to teach them their business.
 A schoolboy error...
 .. and Jim paid dearly for it.
 Demelza?
 What are you wearing?
 I found it, sir, in one of
the chests in the library.
 You dare to go rifling
through those things?
 I'm... I'm sorry, sir. 'Ee never
told me I shouldn't look.
 Surely that was obvious?
 You're employed as a maid.
 ~ I know, sir.
~ And you've been a good one.
 And for that you're allowed
certain liberties.
 But dressing up in fine clothes
is not one of them.
 ~ I meant no 'arm, sir. It was
just rottin' away in that ol' box.
~ Take it off.
 ~ I thought 'ee might let me wear it some...
~ Take it off now!
 If you don't take it off this minute,
 you can pack your things
and go back to your father!
 Demelza.
 Enough! Enough now. I shouldn't
have spoken so harshly.
 Don't take it to heart.
 It's been a hellish day
and I'm not myself.
 What is it? What've I done?
 I didn't take you from
your father for this.
 What do it matter what
you took me for?
 ~ Go to bed.
~ Sir...
~ Go to bed, now.
 What is it?
 The dress...
 .. it unfastens down the back.
 You know what people say of us.
 Yes.
 If we behave like this...
 .. it will be true.
 Then let it be true.
 Where's Francis?
 He did not come home last night.
 ~ He'll have stayed in town with George.
~ That upstart?
 Has he been going to the mine?
 I'm sure he has.
 Elizabeth,
 is he attending to his duties?
 Of course he is, sir.
 Where's Demelza?
 Ain't seen her.
 When she appears, tell her
to start on the barley field.
 You and I will set to with the hay.
 Aye, sir.
 I, sir?!
 You, sir.
 Without Jim to cover your idleness,
 you may be forced to break
a sweat occasionally.
 It isn't right.
 They be sayin' that Jim Carter won't
last five minutes in Bodmin Gaol.
 If fever don't get
him, starvation will.
 Still, if someone we know
hadn't spoke up for him,
 he'd be on his way to seven
years' transportation.
 An unexpected pleasure.
 I was passing this way and...
 I was sorry to hear
about your farm boy.
 Reverend Halse plays cards
with the Warleggans.
 And?
 Perhaps if you'd approached George,
things could have been arranged.
 Is that how justice works?
 We both know it, Ross.
 How's Geoffrey Charles?
 He's my joy.
 Our joy.
 I heard blasting as I
came by Wheal Leisure.
 Have you hit ironstone?
 This is a new interest!
 Francis thinks it's unladylike
 but how else can I understand the
business on which our fortunes,
 and those of our tenants, depend?
 You always had an enquiring mind.
 Marriage discourages such a thing.
 Always?
 Perhaps it depends on the partners.
 Beg your pardon, sir, ma'am.
 Can I get you anything, ma'am?
 Prudie served us.
 Her arm seems recovered.
 Yes, sir.
 I'll just see to these flowers.
 They're very pretty.
 Would you like them?
 Oh!
 Thank you, but I'm afraid
they won't last.
 See, they're fading already.
 Cornflowers are like that.
 I must go.
 I'll see you out.
 Demelza?
 Where's Demelza?
 Last I seen her, she were
headin' towards Sawle
 wi' that blatherin' dog at her heels.
 I engaged you for two years.
 What do you mean by running away?
 ~ Sir, I...
~ Haven't you been well treated?
 Aren't you grown used to
the house, and your tasks...
 and my moods?
 ~ Yes, sir, but...
~ Do you not give me what
I want before I even ask?
 Yes, sir, but I...
 I thought, after what happened...
 You thought you would
no longer be my servant.
 Not from choice, sir.
 You're right.
 You CAN no longer be my servant.
 Dearly beloved,
 we are gathered together
here in the sight of God,
 to join together this
man and this woman
 in holy matrimony.
 Ross Vennor Poldark,
 do you take this woman to
be your lawful wedded wife?
 He's done it now!
 Could have had his pick, any
number of eligible girls.
 Instead of which he marries
his serving wench.
 Young girls these days
have such ideas -
 always trying to rise
above their station!
 How long till we strike copper?
 Could be months.
 Doors which were open will
be slammed in his face.
 Am I prepared to trust him
with more of my capital?
 His ventures will fail.
 We can last till the
week before Christmas.
 "Ross Poldark"
 "too much of a risk for
the prudent investor"?
 And you can enjoy the sight of him
in the gutter, along with his slut.
 Ross'll be sorry he ever wed me.
