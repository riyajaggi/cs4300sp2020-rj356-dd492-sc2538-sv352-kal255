 I cannot marry Mr Whitworth.
Suppose I did ask 'ee to wait?
 We have an invitation
from Sir Francis Basset.
 I trust we have things in common?
 You refused the offer?
 As magistrate you could have done
so much good.
 My son has rickets?!
 Crooked little mite, isn't he?
 How could I have foreseen that
a month ago today I'd be a free man?
 You take full advantage of it.
Believe me, ma'am, I intend to.
 Drake Carne, I have orders
to take you to Truro Jail.
 You mean Drake could hang?
 And what, I wonder, would you
stake to see him acquitted?
 LAUGHTER AND PIPING
 Evening! Salute your new
gravedigger!
 Would that not be grave robber?
 HE LAUGHS
 Speak no ill o' the living,
 'specially 'fore their own
flesh 'n blood!
 Yes, sir, daughter of him.
Though I hope I take not after him!
 Chance'd be a fine thing!
 Do 'ee not dance?
 The Lord do consider it sinful.
 Oh, well, the Lord do sound
a proper spoilsport!
 SHE CHUCKLES
 What's the occasion?
 It's the first harvest of the
land gifted by Captain Ross.
 Giving away your own acreage?
Are 'ee mad?
 If so, 'tis a madness sent by
the Lord in whom we trust.
 Trust Ross.
You'll get a better return.
 True.
 MUSIC AND LAUGHTER
 RATTLING
 We must stiffen security
at all our grain stores.
 These types would have no
compunction about feeding
 their faces at my expense.
 Sir Francis! Ah.
 I assume you've heard the news?
 My elevation to the rank of Burgess?
 I assume you've not heard the news?
Sir Piers Arthur is dead.
 Most distressing.
 And the best news I've had all year.
 Enough, wife. You must know
the book of prayer by heart now.
 Is it not my duty to set
an example to your daughters?
 You have a duty to your husband
 which at present is more pressing.
 Go and join your sister.
 I wish Drake and Sam
would find contentment.
 Have you found it?
 In this moment I have.
 I wish it may last.
 A hundred years old next week!
 You call this Flemish lace?
I look like a desiccated bat!
 Mind that pin!
 I don't wish to be
bled like a stuck pig.
 Sorry, ma'am. Add these
names to the list.
 George Venables, Laurence Trevemper,
 Randolph Pentire.
 They're dead, Aunt. Remember?
 Let me see. Who's coming then?
 Trevaunance? Bodrugan?
 Poldark, that's better.
 People I actually like!
 AGATHA MUTTERS
 I will not have that man in my house!
 In fairness, it's Agatha's house, too.
 Surely, on her 100th birthday,
 we can grant her this one
small request?
 By hosting a frivolous event which
delivers to us no personal benefit?
 What benefit should we seek?
 At least the Penvenen wedding
will provide opportunity.
 For what?
 For me to further my
acquaintance with Lord Falmouth.
 Sir Piers Arthur is dead.
 Truro lacks an MP.
 And the man who instructs
the burgesses to
 vote for his candidate of choice?
 Lord Falmouth.
 INDISTINCT SERMON
 I fear Drake still
hankers for Morwenna.
 I rue the day she ever
crossed his path.
 For giving George the chance
to injure you through them?
 And to think I attempted to
negotiate with him!
 Well, those days are over.
 No more playing the game,
no more seeking terms.
 As for Drake,
I've been making enquiries.
 And?
 The old smith died last month.
 It has a cottage, a stable,
 and some land besides.
 And you have some skill in
smithying, you're a quick learner.
 An' not a farthing to my name.
 It's yours. Already purchased.
 No, brother, 'tis too much.
 I like indebtedness no more than you.
 You saved my life in France.
 The obligation is now discharged.
 It's so quiet here
without Geoffrey Charles.
 BABY CRIES
 Happily, Valentine makes
up for his absence.
 Not happily, so it seems.
 I'm not at all convinced
by Dr Choake's treatment.
 Darkened rooms, legs in splints,
 odious tinctures
which make him vomit...
 I confess, his recovery is taking
longer than was promised.
 You should dispense with
Choake altogether.
 And do what?
 Elizabeth Warleggan requests me
to attend on her son.
 Will you?
 Since I cannot yet return to sea,
 I can at least make myself
useful on land.
 I know what I'd advise -
get rid of the splints
 and the swaddling and put him
out in the fresh air!
 Dr Enys does not subscribe
to old wives' tales.
 In this case he does. Splints
and swaddling have no efficacy,
 and rickets is
exacerbated by lack of light.
 Give him plenty of
fresh fruit, vegetables,
 mother's milk and sunlight. You
will see an improvement within days.
 So no tinctures, powders?
Dr Choake prescribed...
 Dr Choake's prescriptions
 often serve his purse
rather than his patients.
 So my son will not be deformed?
 Follow my instructions and you have
every reason to be hopeful.
 So, your dire predictions
were unfounded.
 He was born under a black moon.
 He may avoid rickets
but he cannot escape his parentage!
 I should know, I've been on
this Earth for nigh on a century.
 So, husband dear, shall
we depart for our wedding?
 You've been petitioning
the Admiralty again?
 No. Why would I?
 I'm considered unfit
to resume my duties.
 As yet.
 For your sake, I'm sorry.
 Don't be.
 I dare say I can bear to convalesce
here a while longer.
 May I escort you to church,
Miss Penvenen?
 Finally, we may end
our pretence of courtship.
 Pray do, Dr Enys.
 I think, wife, before the reception,
I shall avail myself.
 No, I beg you - I'm not
recovered from last night.
 Don't make me strike you!
 SO HELP ME I WILL!
 SHE WHIMPERS
 In the words of St Paul,
 "Wives, submit yourselves
 "unto your husbands
as unto the Lord."
 And Lieutenant Rosewall.
 Captain Poldark and Mistress Poldark.
 Dwight Enys. I never
thought I'd see the day.
 Mr and Mrs Charles Tragoine.
 She do bless you
daily for bringing him home.
 The Reverend Osborne Whitworth
and Mrs Whitworth.
 Morwenna looks pale.
 Doubtless the brat is
making her nauseous.
 Or possibly her husband?
 Lord Falmouth and Mrs Gower.
 Congratulations, my dear.
Thank you.
 To wield such power...
And my conduit to Parliament.
 Come, my dear, let us not pretend
we would not enjoy like status.
 Mr and Mrs Lilycoat.
 My Lord Falmouth.
 My lords, ladies and gentlemen.
Forgive me.
 I promise to be brief in my words
but profuse in my thanks.
 To Caroline, for making
me the happiest of men.
 To all of you, for
joining our festivities.
 But, above all, to one man,
to whom it is entirely due that
 Caroline and I stand here
today as man and wife.
 May I ask you to raise your
glasses to the noblest,
 bravest man I've ever known.
 Captain Ross Poldark.
 ALL: Captain Ross Poldark!
 If you'll permit me?
 Just a few words.
 Saving your blushes, Captain Poldark,
 but I too must express
gratitude to the Hero of Quimper
 for saving my nephew,
Lieutenant Hugh Armitage.
 I second that.
 The Hero of Quimper!
 ALL: The Hero of Quimper!
 My Lord, may I present
my wife, Demelza?
 Your husband is a
reluctant hero, ma'am.
 Yet he cannot avoid the fame
attaching to his exploit.
 I only hope it will not go
to his head and induce him
 to embark on another!
 It is a novelty to find a wife so
eager to keep her husband at home.
 But England may yet have need of him.
 Then, sir, I believe neither
of us will be lacking.
 You must come and visit us some time.
 Thank you.
 You see what I'm up against?
 The man is a braggart,
his wife is a trull!
 This whole event is a waste of time.
 You're no admirer of Lord Falmouth?
 What man of principle could be?
 Not content with running
half of Cornwall,
 he must also be Lord of Truro!
 How can it be that the corporation
is treated as a rich man's chattel?
 Does it not make you all
a laughing stock?
 It does. Hence the growing
discontent among the burgesses.
 And yet my experience in
France has taught me
 that discontent alone is no solution.
 Unless a worthy alternative
is offered... A worthy politician?
 Is there such a thing?
 Change will not be easy,
 particularly while Falmouth holds
sway, nor its advocates popular.
 But you believe the right
candidate exists?
 I've made it my mission to find him.
 You not dancing, sir?
Or do you prefer observin'?
 I used to.
 But since I was in France,
my eyesight has declined.
 But it will mend?
 So Dr Enys assures me.
But where is Captain Poldark?
 Oh, he's hiding so
he may avoid dancing.
 With you as a partner? Is he mad?
 I've often thought so.
 Do I hear you've been gifting
land to out-of-work miners?
 I recommend it, sir.
 Much good can be done with
even the smallest effort.
 My own exertions have been
directed towards a higher goal -
 overturning our old, corrupt
political system.
 To what end?
 So that justice and equity may
filter down to those in most need.
 I applaud your intentions, sir...
 ..without holding out much
hope of their success.
 INDISTINCT CHATTER
 Morwenna, how are you?
 When do you expect?
 I do not know.
 Mama never spoke of such things.
 I did not know what to expect,
 what the... obligations
of marriage would be.
 Is he unkind to you?
 He is a monster.
 Ah, you've escaped.
Excellent. Can we go home?
 You noticed how Falmouth avoided me?
 Did he?
 Nothing I do seems to gratify him.
 I've tried invitations,
compliments, small gifts. Yes.
 I do wonder if it's wise
to be seen... trying so hard?
 How else will he even notice me?
Am I so beneath him?
 Yet the Bassets pass muster,
 and their wealth comes
from mining and banking.
 And is longer standing,
so society has grown used to them.
 Well, that may now be the better route.
 Basset.
 The Truro seat is vacant.
 Lord Falmouth has always dictated
appointments by exerting
 pressure on the burgesses
to vote his way.
 Sir Francis believes such
corruption must be stopped.
 He intends to spearhead
a campaign of reform
 and put up his own candidate
to challenge Falmouth's.
 And that candidate would be?
We'll see.
 We really will be off
to hell in a hand-cart
 if George Warleggan goes to parliament!
 If a hand-cart is your
preferred mode of transport,
 it can swiftly be arranged.
 HE GRUNTS
 I was disappointed in Killewarren.
No chintz, no gilding.
 But the scale of the establishment
puts our humble household to shame.
 I think you should have a companion
 to share the chores
and assist you with the children.
 I shall write to your sister.
 Your mother will be glad to have
another daughter off her hands.
 And doubtless that sister will
come to love me as you do.
 Goodnight.
 I don't love you.
 HE MURMURS INCOHERENTLY
 I love Drake Carne.
 HE SNORES LOUDLY
 I love Drake Carne, I love Drake Carne.
 I love Drake Carne...
SHE SOBS
 I love Drake Carne...
 Shall we pretend this
is our wedding night?
 No pretence needed. Every night
is our wedding night to me.
 Lieutenant Armitage
was most attentive today.
 To whom? Your wife.
Perhaps overly attentive.
 Did you not notice?
 I confess I did not.
 Perhaps I imagined it.
 Quite possibly.
 Not every man in Cornwall
is besotted with you.
 See, brother, 'ee need fret no longer,
 for I've goodly work to keep me
fed an' clothed.
 'Tisn't the body I fret for,
but the soul.
 For I think 'ee still pine for the
girl who be lost to thee.
 Yet the time may come
when 'ee seek elsewhere
 for a wife o' the Methodist
connection, sweet an' pure...
 Wheelwright Carne, a job for ee.
 Missing a crook on the end.
Can 'ee fettle it?
 It looks simple enough.
Will 'ee come back tomorrow?
 If I've naught better to do.
 Sister, how's your soul?
 Are 'ee a stranger to divine things?
 No, lug.
I get my fill of 'em daily!
 Will 'ee not join our meetings where
 we read the gospel an'
open our hearts to each other?
 Cock's life! Tell yer fables to them
who be simple as babies!
 Be that the kind of maid
'ee had in mind?
 G'day sister.
 What brings 'ee here?
 News of Morwenna.
 Good news?
 She's with child.
 I can only pray the
child will be a comfort to her.
 In my heart I know I must
now let her go.
 Yes, brother, you must.
 Search the attics, cellars,
all store-rooms and cupboards.
 The item was packed away
when I first took up residence here.
 It belongs to old mistress Agatha.
 Find it.
 Yes, sir.
 I think he's already
showing an improvement.
 No doubt your aunt will
claim the credit.
 But it matters not,
 so long as he is improved.
 SHE CHUCKLES
 BABY GURGLES
 Did Dwight mention he'd
been called to Trenwith?
 No. Why would he?
 The child has rickets.
 Valentine.
'Tis said he may end up lame.
 Surely that's no concern of ours?
 No, Ross.
 I'm away to see Pascoe.
I'll be back before supper.
 Yes, Ross.
 BACKGROUND CHATTER
 As requested, I've had prepared
the deed of gift for your land.
 You should be aware of some news
which has just reached me.
 The Warleggans and the Bassets
have formed an accommodation.
 A merger? Not exactly - but an
arrangement with each other's banks
 whereby they will work together.
 I suspect this scheme has less
 to do with business ambition
than political.
 Mr Pascoe.
 Sir Francis.
 Captain Poldark, you vanished from
the wedding before I had chance
 to invite you and your charming wife
to dinner.
 We seldom stir abroad, sir.
 Then I hope you will make this the
exception. Shall we say Saturday?
 Your wife will be gratified.
 I believe she enjoys
high society these days.
 She has no spurious fame to contend
with. Whereas I am only too aware
 it's the sole reason
for my sudden popularity!
 Take her. What harm could it do?
 I've missed you, sister!
Rowella!
 You're not well.
 Yes! Quite well! I've no complaint.
 I should think not!
 Your sister is most
blessed amongst women.
 Yes, Osborne.
 In private, you may call me
Mr Whitworth.
 In public, you will
address me as "Vicar".
 Yes, Vicar.
 The blessed Virgin an' the Holy Child?
 Oh, brother, it do gladden the heart
to see 'ee turn to God again.
 Yes, brother.
 I believe this be the item in question.
 Yes!
 HE CHUCKLES
 You seem excited.
Is there good news?
 There is. And soon, I hope,
there will be better.
 Am I permitted to know?
 Let us say that if my visit
to Tehidy goes well...
 Tehidy? Did Sir Francis invite?
 He did not, but I know him to
be at home today and we are now
 on such terms as to render
formal invitations unnecessary.
 The key is to strike
while the iron's hot.
 The door is ajar.
Sir Francis is open to persuasion.
 All he requires is a little push.
 Take a week, Georgie.
 I shan't be upset if you miss my party.
 Thanks for the reminder, ma'am.
 We will discuss that very subject
when I return.
 SHE SCOFFS
 I can think of a hundred more
useful things I could be doing.
 For shame, Ross, you're
becoming a misanthrope!
 I sympathise. I'm no lover
of company these days.
 With the exception of my wife's.
 Sometimes Ross do make no exception.
 Well, if I have my way...
 Which you frequently do!
 ..this will be our last excursion
for the foreseeable future.
 Why, sister, would you
agree to marry that man?
 To save the life of the man I loved.
 And still love?
 Till my dying breath.
 Tell me of him. Tell me everything.
 Now we have an unexpected
addition to our party.
 He got wind of your invitation
and insisted on joining us.
 Who can guess at his motives!
 His uncle and I
cannot abide each other.
 Our ways of doing business
are wholly at odds.
 But I have a certain
fondness for the nephew.
 So I trust you'll forgive me
for inflicting him upon you!
 Armitage!
Are we never to be rid of you?
 You'll be sorry you ever saved me!
 I regret the venture daily!
 I'm sure Dwight does! Now he's my
prisoner instead of the Republic's!
 And from that there can be no release!
 If you knew the pains I took
to get myself invited today...
 Why did you so?
 Can you not guess?
 CAROLINE: ..then you are very much
in the minority, my Lord.
 The young general who crushed
the counter-revolution in Paris -
 I believe we'll be hearing
a good deal of him in future.
 You mean Bonaparte? He's now in
charge of the French army in Italy.
 Cleared the streets of Paris with
cannon. Fired on his own countrymen.
 Such a man is to be reckoned with!
And their Directory of Five,
 who deposed the other
blood-stained tyrants?
 They're criminals,
in every sense of the word!
 My Uncle Falmouth would be
relieved to hear you say so.
 He speculated that in dining with
so prominent a Whig, I'd hear talk
 of peace and views
favourable to the revolution.
 Then your uncle should know better.
 The true Whig is as patriotic
as any Tory in the land.
 And what form might Lord Falmouth's
plans for Truro take?
 Who will be the next MP?
You, perhaps?
 I'm not sufficiently biddable!
Too much of a rebel!
 I would have thought that made you
the ideal candidate -
 if revolution is your aim.
 Which it is not.
I know my limitations.
 At sea I'm a passable navigator,
on land an average poet
 and an indifferent artist.
 You've been sketching? May we see?
 By no means. I've failed miserably
to do justice to my subject.
 Mr Warleggan is here to see you, sir.
 Advise him I am engaged
and may be some time.
 I have taken the liberty of
providing some small entertainments.
 Shall we adjourn?
 I shall await his pleasure here.
 Your turn, I think.
 So navigation, I think
you said, at sea?
 At sea. Yes. Which is
where I presently find myself.
 Wholly disorientated.
 Shipwrecked. Lost.
 It must seem strange to
return to the comfort an' safety
 of home after the horrors of prison.
 I know Dwight also struggled.
 My struggles are of a different kind.
 So different that
I dare not even name them.
 And you will not ask me to.
'Tis hardly my business.
 I wish that were true.
 Blooms from the Garden of Eden!
 But where lurks Eve?
 And where the snake?
 I've taken note of your suggestion.
 Gifting land to the deserving poor.
 And the undeserving poor?
 Let us begin by helping
those who help themselves.
 When do we begin?
 Do you believe in equality?
 I believe in opportunity. I believe
that industry should be rewarded
 and the misuse of power punished.
 We appear to be of one mind.
 Shall you return to the navy?
 Once my eyes have mended.
The fault is entirely my own
 for scribbling away in
semi-darkness. Letters home?
 Sketches. Attempts at verse.
It was all that kept me sane.
 You were sketching today.
May I show you?
 I'm no Leonardo,
 but you are surely Mona Lisa.
 I... do not know these people.
 Forgive me - my attempt
at a compliment.
 Perhaps I should stick to verse.
 Especially with such
inspiration before me.
 No-one's ever written me poetry
before. Not even your husband?
 Ross has been called many things
 but "poetic" is not one of them!
 May I see you again?
 And Ross, too, of course.
 I will ask him
when would be convenient.
 Let us suppose that the burgesses
are sick of being forced to
 cast their votes at Falmouth's command.
 Should we also suppose that they're
sick of the favours they enjoy,
 the business that comes their way
in exchange for those votes?
 In the coming Truro by-election,
 many have indicated
their willingness to defy Falmouth.
 And instead of voting for his
candidate, vote for yours?
 We both agree change is long overdue.
 With the right man in place...
The right man?
 I believe that you are the man
to lead this revolution.
 If elected, you will serve
our borough in parliament.
 And I'd be expected
to vote as you directed.
 Since you and I think
along similar lines...
 it can surely be no hardship
to vote likewise?
 Truly, I believe that if you and I
walked into a room,
 all the men would look at me,
 but within five minutes
they'd all be clustered around you.
 I'm not sure that's a compliment.
 It is! But not one I think
Ross would appreciate.
 If he even noticed.
 Back already, Georgie? I told you
we could manage without ye.
 Remind me, what is your age, ma'am?
 You know fine well I shall be
a hundred years old on Monday.
 When I was last at Sawle Church,
 I had occasion to
glance at the parish register.
 I could find no record
of your baptism in 1695.
 Of course, I was not content
to leave it there,
 for baptisms do not always
instantly follow births.
 So yesterday I had the servants
comb the house
 until they found the old Poldark
family Bible.
 And? What of it?
 Let me read you an entry.
 The ink is faded but I suppose it
to be your father's handwriting.
 "Born to us this autumn morn,
our first child,
 "a daughter, Agatha Mary.
 "September 14th, 1697."
 So you see, old crone,
 on Monday you will be but 98.
 'Tis a lie. A scabby lie!
 My dear?
How went the visit to Tehidy?
 We will discuss it another time.
 Well?
 I regret I must decline.
 Your reason?
 I cannot be another man's puppet -
not even one I admire
 nor whose views are
so similar to my own.
 You cannot ignore
the way the world works.
 If you dislike the system,
change it from within.
 There is sense in what you say.
But?
 But the noble impulse which
impels a man to enter politics
 often falls by the wayside.
 Power is pursued for its own sake
rather than the good it can do.
 Who am I to claim exemption
from these failings?
 Will you not even try?
 I cannot believe I would emerge from
this process with my soul intact.
 Your soul?
 Your stubbornness!
 It will be your undoing, Poldark.
 This shoe does pinch my toes.
 See how easy it is to be rid of him?
 Shh! Do not jest about it.
 He is my husband till death do us part.
 Amen, sister.
 I think it was a mistake
to refuse Sir Francis.
 I never knew you had ambitions
to be a political wife.
 Nor do I.
 But you, your influence is great -
there's much good you could do.
 And is not Sir Francis a goodly man?
 Yes, but he too uses his
power for his own ends
 and he would use me if I would let him.
 But I will not.
 KNOCKING
 Come in, Lucy Pipe, idle girl!
 Where's my supper?!
 There will be no supper, old woman.
 There will be no party.
 I'll have letters sent to
all your guests informing them
 that you made a mistake,
that you are 97 not 99,
 and a new invitation will
be issued in two years' time.
 If you're still above ground then.
 But...'tis all prepared,
 food ordered,
 my old topaz ring altered to fit.
 A pity.
 My birthday's on Monday,
98's a good age.
 I've been looking forward
to this party for so long,
 no-one need know I'm not a hundred.
 I'll not live two year more.
You know that.
 Who'd guess if you said naught?
 I'll not cross ye again, George.
 Let me have my party.
 There will be no party.
 Wait!
 You do this to me,
 may you rot in hell!
 You and your nasty uncle
and your little, twisted son,
 born under a black moon,
and warped already!
 Little Valentine,
 the so-called Warleggan heir.
 Or is he?
 That was no eight-month baby,
George.
 Early babes be weak and wrinkled -
no hair, no nails.
 But that babe was lusty and smooth
 and strong as a full-term child!
 So maybe you didn't
wait for the wedding?
 Or maybe somebody
 got there before ye!
 George?
 Are you unwell?
 That old woman...
 ..will have no party.
 What do you mean?
Has she given orders to defer it?
 Sir Francis Basset is here, sir.
 What the devil can he want?
 You called to see me today.
 I did, sir.
But you were otherwise engaged
 and now I fear the moment has passed.
 Not necessarily.
 Was there something
you wanted to discuss?
 Change.
Yes?
 That is what you seek.
But it's not easy to achieve.
 Nor its advocates popular.
 Go on.
 The right man would
not need to be popular.
 He would only need to be capable
 of achieving the task in hand,
by whatever means necessary.
 My party, my birthday, my birthday...
 SHE MUTTERS
 Aunt?
 My party... What has happened?
My party, my party...
 George won't allow my party.
 Be calm, dearest aunt.
 Tormented me, he did.
 Took my hope, took my home.
 Do not exert yourself.
 Yet... I should not
have said what I did.
 Elizabeth...
 will never forgive me.
 Forgive you?
 I should not have told him.
 Told him what?
 Aunt?
 Told him what?
 Aunt?
 Told him what?
 BABY CRIES
 Well, ma'am, I hope we can count on
your support in our newest venture?
 A candidate to challenge
Lord Falmouth in the coming
 by-election has been found.
 Is this true?
 It is a fine thing for young Valentine
 to have an MP as a father.
 Indeed.
 Forgive me. My great aunt...
 is dead.
 My sincere condolences.
I will detain you no longer.
 I trust, when you have
grieved for the departed,
 that there will be
time for celebration.
 'Ee be like unto the
lost sheep, brother,
 thy thoughts all pure again.
 My thoughts are not pure, brother.
 Mine neither. God forgive me.

 Sir Francis is right.
You are stubborn.
 Pragmatic.
Pig-headed.
 Would you prefer naive or sentimental?
 Sometimes, Ross, yes, I would.
 This just come from Trenwith.
 What is it?
 Aunt Agatha's dead.
 Ross...
 I should have been there.
 Poor 'ole cooter.
 To think of 'er on 'er death-bed
 with no Poldark kin
to ease 'er departing.
 Shh, shh, shh, shh... Prudie.
 She be last of the Trenwith Poldarks.
 There's still Geoffrey Charles.
 Doubtless George'll find a way
to part him from his inheritance.
 Judas!
 There was more to George's note
than the news of her death.
 Funeral arrangements?
 Not a word.
What, then?
 "I hope you and Demelza will rejoice in
 "the news that I have been selected
by Sir Francis Basset to be
 "the candidate to oppose
 "Lord Falmouth's
in the Truro by-election."
 Well, there it is.
 Yes, an' you could've prevented it!
 No, I couldn't.
 Will you never learn? How long do
you think you can do as you please?
 Plough your own furrow regardless
of anyone else or I? Demelza...
 Not once have you asked my advice
or harkened to my opinion!
 Not once!
What do you want, Demelza?
 A man who will lie down, roll over,
 sit up and beg for you?
 Well, if so, you've married

 I met Elizabeth.
 I love her, Demelza.
