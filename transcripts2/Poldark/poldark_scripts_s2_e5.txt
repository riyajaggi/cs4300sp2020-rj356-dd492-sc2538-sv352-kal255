 I've extended your loan for another year.
 - You're rather impertinent. - I like you very much, too.
 I must return to civilisation. I wonder if we'll ever meet again.
 Your cove is ideal.
 We could land there, and all you'd need to do is draw your curtains.
 Mr Trencrom did advise us to trust no-one.
 We are £200 less in debt than we were this morning.
 That won't buy you out of prison!
 Were we not in dire straits, I wouldn't do it.
 George has bought up more of Wheal Leisure.
 As a principal shareholder,
 it befits me to take a more robust interest.
 Let's examine my failings once you've delivered our child.
 You have a son.
 I never thought I'd see the day.
 Wheal Grace.
 You're suggesting we go into partnership?
 Yes.
 ALL: The Poldarks and Wheal Grace.

 ENGINE RUMBLES
 My father would be amazed.
 At our new engine?
 At my reading matter.
 I think he would approve of both.
 ENGINE RUMBLES
 Trevithick makes bold claims for this engine.
 50 fathoms - can it really drain so deep?
 I hope so.
 We've just sunk the last of our capital into it.
 Free trading's a capital offence. Take him to Truro Jail!
 Stand aside!
 No, no, no!
 Ted!
 Go on...
 Ted!
 Go on!
 Where were they caught?
 Tregunna Cove.
 Tregunna?
 You may well be surprised!
 Last place anyone would expect a landing.
 'Tis why we chose it -
 'tis full of rocks and teasy currents.
 So was it just ill luck?
 Or did someone betray us?
 Gentlemen, it is a pleasure to have you with us on our adventure.
 The pleasure's ours, Mr Poldark.
 And to be frank, the joy's gone out of Leisure
 since George Warleggan acquired more shares.
 There's talk of lower earnings - even closures.
 That won't happen while I still have a stake.
 Your stake is now so small as to be insignificant, as is mine.
 All we can do is take our dividends and watch others make decisions.
 Now our affections lie with Grace.
 She may be temperamental, but at least she's ours.
 Shall we go to work?
 Sir.
 Thank you.
 Ted Carkeek's been arrested!
 He's in court this afternoon.
 I must go.
 My knee still pains me, sir.
 All the time?
 Only when it goes stiff.
 'Tis like someone turn a key and lock it.
 Dr Choake did advise to cut it off.
 A convenient solution, Charlie...for him.
 SHE GROANS
 I want you to keep it bound for a week until I come to see you again.
 I don't see it's needful for 'ee to be fiddling with it so oft, Surgeon.
 Rosina does get along fine as she is.
 If I can help your daughter, that's surely a good thing,
 is it not, Mr Hoblin?
 Will any of you go to court?
 And see Ted sent for transportation?
 - Ha! Or worse. - Don't say that!
 'Tis gauger Vercoe to blame. He'll not turn a blind eye.
 - There's talk of an informer. - Since when?
 Mr Trencrom sent word today.
 And it isn't like Trencrom to raise false alarm.
 But who could it be?
 Trencrom say it could be anyone.
 FOOTSTEPS APPROACH
 Do I look distinguished?
 Perhaps you should be aiming for severe.
 But is that the best way to help Ted, I wonder?
 Mighty fligged out for the mine, Francis!
 I'm due in court, Aunt.
 On what charge?
 Carrying out my duties as a magistrate.
 Come, Master Jeremy, let's have you scrubbed up.
 Ross, I don't think you should go.
 Ted is one of my tenants and workers.
 And a fellow free trader!
 How will it look if you're seen to sympathise?
 As if you're involved, which you are!
 Three drops in our cove already this year.
 But this was not our cove, and no-one can point the finger.
 Yet!
 What would you have me do?
 Not go to court,
 and tell Trencrom he may no longer use our cove.
 And save himself our fee, so we have even less coming in?
 Is that what you want?
 Are you not afeared to think of one of our own betraying us?
 Of course, I'm concerned. I'll be on my guard.
 I will look twice at even our closest friends.
 But still go to court?
 I think I must.
 I'll fetch my hat.
 Was that a yawn, Horace?
 Shall you find this place awfully dreary after a year in London?
 We needn't stay long, once our engagement's announced tonight.
 Uncle Ray!
 Caroline, my dear.
 Mwah!
 Well, are you ready to embrace your fate?
 Do you suppose Mrs Figg has any marzipan for Horace?
 Shall we ride to Truro and find some for you?
 DOG BARKS
 So, she has agreed to your engagement?
 Well, I think so...
 Unwin, I seldom entertain,
 and the sole reason for tonight's dinner is to make an announcement.
 You'd better be sure there is one.
 AGATHA COUGHS
 That cough has worsened, Aunt.
 Would you have me call Dr Choake?
 - If I wished to be bled to death. - SHE COUGHS
 I've...I've already sent for someone.
 Dr Enys?
 Someone far more sensible.
 And that concludes my evidence, your worship -
 only to add that I hope 'ee see fit to send these men to the gallows,
 for how else may we break our shores of this iniquitous trade?
 We thank you for your diligence, Mr Vercoe. You may stand down.
 A straightforward case, I think,
 in the context of the monstrous events still unfolding in France?
 I agree with you, sir.
 My concern...
 Which I share - is how to balance severity of judgment with
 the appearance of mercy.
 The appearance of mercy?
 For, as you say, our duty is to allay rebellion, not stoke it.
 But the punishment...
 Oh, I agree - it should not be a crown of thorns
 for them to wear with pride.
 Yet if they wish to make martyrs of themselves...
 Then let us disappoint them.
 We both know the type -
 bone idle.
 One has only to look at them.
 Then let us sentence them to the last thing they would seek...
 ..ignominious...
 backbreaking...
 without a shred of honour.
 Sentenced to three months' hard labour.
 Praise be!
 I take my hat off to you, Francis.
 You played him at his own game - something I've never achieved!
 Can you live with yourself?
 Oh, I think so!
 I know for a fact that Halse has brandy in his cellar
 which came from such a run!
 Don't let that reassure you.
 With an informer at large,
 this won't be the last case which comes before the court,
 and our friend Halse will be keen to make the next man pay.
 SHEEP BLEAT
 Dr Enys!
 How fares our little backwater?
 A good deal duller than London, I imagine.
 Hmm, you imagine right.
 Having just returned, I'm already yawning.
 Can you prescribe me a pick-me-up?
 Do your mining interests not invigorate?
 On the contrary.
 But perhaps your interest in Wheal Leisure is not in actual mining?
 Do I hear you're now physician at Killewarren?
 Mr Penvenen keeps in good health - I rarely see him.
 Whereas I saw a good deal of his niece in London.
 I trust she was well.
 You've not heard from her?
 Nor did I expect to.
 Then I assume her arrival here today, with Unwin,
 for their special announcement this evening,
 will not inconvenience you?
 Not in the least. Good day to you, sir.
 HE KNOCKS ON THE CARRIAGE
 Why, Dr Enys!
 How diverting!
 Miss Penvenen.
 How is the scurvy in Sawle?
 Better, I thank you.
 The potato crop did not fail this year, and there were apples.
 But no oranges?
 Dear me, were there no other ladies hereabouts to whom you might appeal,
 and tug on their heartstrings in the name of charity?
 I hope you're in good health, Miss Penvenen.
 I bid you good day.
 We meet after a year's absence and you haven't a civil word for me?
 I'm old-fashioned in these matters, Miss Penvenen.
 I thought civility should be shown on both sides.
 Would you excuse me?
 Verity!
 My dears!
 How is she?
 All the better for seeing you.
 Until she learns I can only stay a few days.
 It's good to have you home.
 HE SNIFFS
 DOOR OPENS
 Ah, the prodigal returns.
 How was London?
 Invigorating, and home to many fine banks.
 I wonder, is it not time we had one of our own in Truro?
 I have news of an interesting document.
 Hmm?
 A promissory note for £1,000 with interest at 40%.
 The lender believes it will never be repaid.
 If we offered to buy the debt...
 And why would we do that?
 Because the debtor would then be at our mercy.
 HORSES TROT
 - ROSS: - You seem lively tonight.
 DEMELZA: Could it be that Jeremy's safe in bed,
 and we're dining out at Killewarren after
 a year of turnips and tetty pie?
 Take care you don't overdo the port and trip over
 Caroline Penvenen's intended.
 Perhaps if I did, my husband would pay me attention!
 Have I been so neglectful of late?
 Ask your other wife, Grace!
 True, she is more taxing than you...
 but not as lovely.
 So tonight you'll have eyes for none but me?
 Tonight I'll have eyes for none but you.
 A new dress?
 If only!
 You?
 How I wish!
 Shall we go in?
 Do you not agree that since I've become an MP,
 Cornwall is a better place?
 In what regard?
 Why, only today we've seen the arrest of more smugglers.
 For which you take credit?
 Mmm, since I've made it my mission to curb lawlessness
 among the vulgars.
 Which reminds me, may I seek your advice
 on the shameful lack of banking premises in Truro?
 Awkward?
 Not for me.
 The last time we met, he went head over heels.
 I doubt he'll be keen to repeat the experience.
 Please be seated, everyone!
 Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
 You're welcome.
 VIOLIN MUSIC PLAYS
 Must you sit here, Unwin?
 Have you not had enough of my company in London?
 I hope to have it officially after tonight.
 Captain Poldark, have you been in any scrapes since I've been away?
 I was most diverted by your last court appearance.
 I try to avoid the place whenever possible, ma'am.
 By leading a virtuous life?
 I'm attempting to, ma'am.
 I fear the execution is often beyond me.
 She's very striking, isn't she?
 Do you believe that what the eye does not admire,
 the heart does not desire?
 It's always been so with me...
 ..as you should know.
 Should I? We see little of each other now.
 I'm not sure I know you at all.
 Nor I, you, but that's hardly surprising.
 How much did we ever know of each other?
 Even before...
 Before you went away?
 It seems like a lifetime ago.
 In some ways.
 So you have returned, Captain!
 Aye, ma'am.
 I was plagued with a fever and have come back to convalesce.
 Well, doubtless you'll enjoy exploring the coves hereabouts.
 You looking for smugglers, are you, sir?
 But surely after your last visit, you've quite put them down?
 Aye, but they're damnably sly, ma'am.
 One can never be certain how they're disguised.
 I hope you do not suppose me to be such a one!
 It's only now I realise how young you were when you
 promised to marry me.
 I should have been old enough to know my own mind.
 Let us agree that you were young,
 and then you thought I was dead.
 Did I?
 Or did I think I loved Francis better?
 How soon I discovered my mistake.
 HE EXHALES
 This is some pleasant jest, surely?
 If it is, then it's against myself.
 Is it so astonishing that a woman
 who changed her mind once would change it twice?
 Cannot a woman love two men?
 Cannot a man love two women?
 I'm with Francis, and happy to be so -
 we're alike in many ways -
 but a piece of my heart will always be yours,
 as a piece of yours will always be mine.
 THEY GIGGLE
 - UNWIN: - Treat me with deference when we're married.
 If that day ever comes.
 Then, name it, Caroline, I beg you.
 I deplore beggars.
 Oh, how vexing you are!
 UNWIN SIGHS
 Infuriating woman!
 How is your friend Dr Enys?
 Wedded to his work, ma'am...
 with no time for distractions.
 Would you count me a distraction?
 I shouldn't presume to connect you with Dr Enys in any way,
 but I'm sure he'll wish you well on the occasion of your engagement!
 DOOR CLOSES
 Aunt Agatha's very angry with me for calling you.
 What troubles her?
 A cough, a sore throat, and she tells me, a fever -
 but I can find no sign of it.
 I need no physician.
 Little Verity's perfectly capable of tending me.
 But when the time comes for her to return home...?
 This is her home!
 What is there to interest her elsewhere?
 A husband?
 Trenwith has never been the same since she left.
 Can you diagnose the complaint?
 I'll do my best.
 Are you married, sir?
 I'm not, ma'am.
 VIOLINS PLAY
 My friends, my friends...
 MUSIC STOPS ..I thank you, one and all,
 for joining me on this auspicious occasion.
 My dear niece, Caroline,
 will soon no longer be under my charge,
 for in December she comes of age,
 but, before that, I do believe I have to resign her
 to the care of another.
 Unwin?
 Where is he?
 Caroline?
 I believe I saw him heading for his horse.
 Oh, dear, I hope I haven't said anything to upset him.
 Shall we have dancing?
 Can you tell what ails her?
 I have my suspicions. I'll call again tomorrow. In the meantime...
 What shall I give her?
 Honey, juniper,
 a little warm milk,
 and your very best attention.
 Thank you.
 LIVELY MUSIC PLAYS
 There's a novelty. A married couple who enjoy each other's company.
 But then, did they not marry for love?
 Allegedly.
 Dear me! How reckless!
 Francis, how good to see you.
 I regret I cannot return the compliment.
 This spite is pointless, Francis.
 From your cousin I've come to expect no reason, but...
 Well, expect none from me.
 Good evening, George.
 Ross.
 I...had not expected to see you here.
 - Hm. - Ray Penvenen will insist on inviting the riff-raff.
 I hope your new mine prospers.
 It will.
 I wish I had your confidence.
 Must you be envious even of that?
 We will use whatever means necessary to acquire that promissory note.
 - What was Elizabeth saying to you? - Nothing of importance.
 May I join you?
 The water levels have fallen at least a foot.
 By my calculation.
 - And you'll continue to monitor them? - Surely.
 So the engine appears to be working?
 It would appear so.
 What's our plan?
 Continue to drain. Tomorrow we blast.
 Then sift the ore, and if we're lucky...
 Copper! The elusive Trevorgie lode!
 Let's get started!
 I don't mind sayin', when Mr Francis first came aboard
 I had my doubts, but he's shown himself more'n equal to the task.
 Your sort ain't welcome round here!
 What's that?
 'Twill be ole Nick Vigus. The folk say he's the informer.
 That wouldn't surprise me.
 Backstabber, I say!
 Hey!
 Why do these men attack you, Nick?
 No idea, Cap'n. I ain't done nothin'!
 Why would they think you had?
 Damned if I know.
 Damned you may be!
 I suspect they attack you
 for your habit of turning against your fellows.
 I, sir?
 You, sir.
 Letting Jim Carter take the blame for your poaching escapade?
 Pocketing George Warleggan's guineas to testify against me in court?
 I ain't the informer.
 But since you do accuse me, let me ask,
 why shouldn't a man sell himself to the highest bidder?
 Times like this, it's every man for himself.
 Betray us, you betray yourself.
 Fine words for gentlefolk to spout,
 with no notion of what it's like to live in squalor,
 even if he think he do by slummin' with scullery maids!
 Cap'n Ross! Cap'n Ross!
 Let him be! Let him be!
 Have Dr Enys clean him up.
 What price would you be willing to pay for that promissory note?
 Any.
 I thought so.
 What will you do with it?
 That will depend.
 I cannot believe you would call...
 After my reception from Francis last night?
 I don't expect you to be disloyal to Francis,
 but don't you personally think this feud has gone on long enough?
 You know Francis when his mind is set.
 He holds you to blame for the prosecution of Ross.
 Ross!
 I wish I could enjoy the favour in your eyes that he does.
 But let me be frank with you.
 Ross and I have never seen eye to eye.
 On my part, it's no more than a clash of personality.
 On his, it's a disease.
 He plunges headlong from one disaster to another and blames me for all of them.
 I hardly think that's fair.
 It comes of being born into money.
 But with it comes lack of judgment.
 His ill-conceived smelting venture was doomed from the start.
 When he was out-of-pocket as a result,
 he was too proud to ask friends for assistance and instead signed
 a promissory note for £1,000 at 40% interest!
 When he ultimately beggars himself, and Francis with him, no doubt
 he'll accuse me of stealing the copper from his ground overnight!
 May I ask how you learned of this promissory note?
 It came into the hands of my Uncle Cary.
 And what does your uncle intend to do with it?
 To let me deal with it.
 Perhaps you'd like me to make a gift of it to Ross?
 Would you?
 If I thought he might drop his enmity.
 Do you ask it of me?
 What would you ask in return?
 Merely to be admitted to your friendship again.
 I'll see what I can do.
 George Warleggan? I remember the first time Francis brought you here!
 Fligged out in your frills and fallallery!
 I remember it, too.
 Speak up, boy, I'm a little deaf.
 And still above ground!
 There should be a law to kill off old crones.
 Velvets and silks you wore. 'Twas plain your mother had no taste.
 If you were the last of the Poldarks I'd do it myself.
 And you, staring about like a bull-calf
 that had strayed from its stall.
 But never fear, your great-nephews
 are digging their own graves without my help.
 Goodbye, old woman.
 I hope when I next call, you'll be six feet below.
 I expect Jud'll be waitin' for the plantin' to be finished
 before he come sneakin' back?
 Don't speak o' that lizard to me!
 Perhaps he's the informer!
 That braggashans? He is too loose-lipped to keep his trap shut!
 While passing your husband's mine,
 I came upon a man who was bruised and bleeding.
 His name was...Vigus?
 I know him. He works there on tribute.
 He tells me there's a deal of ill-feeling about
 on account of the rumours.
 Rumours?
 Of an informer?
 Ah, but you're so out of the way here,
 perhaps the tales do not reach you.
 At any rate, the rumours make people tetchy.
 Whoever gave Vigus a beating must have strong suspicions
 as to his involvement in the Trade.
 And were you able to discover who it was?
 No, I was not minded to at this stage.
 I hope the assailant will realise his error and not repeat it.
 One can only feel for the man's wife,
 having such temper to contend with.
 Dr Enys! Have you heard of Nick Vigus?
 Captain Poldark did clout him, yet he swears he's no traitor.
 Why would any suspect him?
 We all suspect each other, sir.
 Do make the blood run cold to think one of our own be false.
 Dr Enys!
 Charlie!
 Do tell Rosina how my health is mended since I turned my hand to sailmaking.
 I could provide handsome, should I choose to wed again.
 Do you have someone in mind?
 Mebbe.
 Mebbe I have someone in mind myself.
 Nay, don't you flutter yer eyes at t'surgeon. He's not for thee.
 Nor for any maid, sir. I'm wedded to my work.
 I thought I might find you here, tending your beloved fisher folk!
 You'll excuse me, Miss Penvenen, I've no time to...
 Let me apologise. For my discourtesy, the other day.
 There!
 You weren't expecting that!
 Do you dislike me so very much?
 Dislike?
 If coming between me and my work every day for the last 12 months,
 if being unable to forget your voice
 or the way you turn your head
 or the lights in your hair, if wanting to hear that you're married
 and dreading to hear that you're married,
 if that's dislike...
 ..perhaps you can identify these symptoms for me?
 Do you ride for pleasure?
 I shall be in the woods
 by Killewarren just after eight tomorrow.
 McNeil was here.
 Encouraged by your smiles of last night, no doubt?
 Driven by the sight of the bruisin' you gave Nick Vigus!
 You think he comes here for me but what if he comes here for you?
 What if he knows something?
 - Of what? - Your dealings with Trencrom!
 The more he comes calling...
 The more likely he is to sniff something out.
 And you cannot now offer discouragement
 without arousing suspicions as to why!
 So I'm to blame?
 You missed a treat. George Warleggan graced us with his presence.
 What did he want?
 To be reconciled with you.
 Is that why he called when my back was turned?
 I know he's been vicious in his pursuit of Ross,
 but I begin to think he would make amends if he could.
 - How? - By not taking advantage of the power he holds.
 You know he owns the ground we walk on.
 What harm can it do for you to modify your hostility towards him,
 if only to deter him from wielding power over us all?
 Perhaps I'll ride over and see him.
 Wished me dead, he did. Called me "old crone."
 What's that, Aunt?
 Big mistake.
 Francis.
 Elizabeth tells me you called today.
 I hope you took the visit in the spirit in which it was intended.
 I believe I did.
 And I hope you will take what I have to say in the same spirit.
 You will never again set foot in my house.
 Nor approach me, or my family - including my son.
 He is no longer your godson.
 We are no longer your friends.
 You may turn us out of Trenwith if you wish.
 It will be a small price to pay
 to escape the noxiousness of your acquaintance.
 Call in his loans. Turn 'em out into the fields!
 I will not make Elizabeth suffer for her husband's folly.
 And thanks to that promissory note, I do not need to.
 I cannot but admire Francis.
 - What? - Well, he's not as handsome as some, nor as daring,
 but he has a wisdom and he values his own skin.
 He'll mebbe live longer on that account.
 Do I not have wisdom?
 Can you tell if a man be a traitor to his friends or no'?
 Perhaps you should've married my cousin?
 He's a good man. He has things you lack.
 Though you have things that he lacks!
 Put the two of you together, it would make a complete man!
 Do I leave such a lot to be desired?
 Yes, Ross. A lot to be desired.
 Ssssh! Don't wake Mama.
 Papa has to be off early to the mine to start the blasting.
 I'll be home in time to read you a story.
 I've told Henshawe I'll set the fuses myself. Shall we go below?
 By all means.
 I've a feeling our fortunes will change today. They need to!
 After what I said to George last night.
 You're in haste.
 I have a rendezvous.
 With Caroline?
 Don't excite yourself. It'll come to nothing!
 We could not be less suited. She is an heiress, and I am...
 As lowly as a kitchen maid?
 May not a woman confer status as well as a man?
 Ross raised me up.
 And Ross knows he was entirely the winner in that transaction!
 Ma'am.
 Thank you.
 Here's to copper, gentlemen.
 Anything?
 What do you make of this?
 Let's collect more samples, bring 'em above and examine them fully.
 Mistress Poldark above for you, Cap'n. She say it's urgent.
 You go, Ross. I'll stay here.
 This came for you.
 It's from Pascoe.
 I'm wanted in Truro.
 Is it bad news?
 I'll know more when I see him.
 I have no idea why I'm here.
 Well then, you'll be glad to hear that I'm leaving today.
 Uncle Ray is angry with me.
 I suspect he wants me safely locked away until my marriage.
 Which is...to be when?
 Who knows?
 At any rate, not Unwin.
 He jilted me.
 Or was it the other way round?
 Tell me, who is Dwight Enys?
 Is he the strong, capable man that bestrides the sick room
 or the hesitant one I see here today?
 A man with not the smallest fortune.
 Money was never plentiful and studying took all I had.
 I hardly ever met women, except as cases.
 So if you come to me with a sore throat...
 I know what to do.
 But if I meet you in a drawing room...
 ..you are a creature whose moods and manners
 I've never learnt to decipher -
 and if you laugh at me, which you frequently do,
 I become tongue-tied and foolish.
 Poor Dwight.
 Do I show such confidence and poise?
 How well I've been schooled.
 While you were learning to be a physician,
 I was learning to be an heiress.
 An heiress must learn how to walk,
 to dress, to ride, to dance.
 You say you don't know women, except as patients.
 I don't know men at all.
 What would you like to know?
 And now...
 no doubt, you hate me.
 And now, no doubt, I hate you.
 I must go...
 until December.
 Nothing will change.
 One thing will change.
 In December, I come of age.
 Did Francis make his peace with George last night?
 Not as far as I know.
 When can I go down the mine, mama?
 When copper is found.
 Will it be?
 I've never seen Francis more convinced of anything.
 Or more determined to be the one to find it.
 He's been so long in Ross's shadow,
 I think he wants to earn his admiration.
 And yours?
 Since it's to be your last night with us,
 I've asked Mrs Tabb for a special dessert.
 Have you seen Captain Henshawe?
 Or Zacky Martin?
 Just missed 'em, sir.
 Can I be of service?
 No, no matter. I'll ride to Nampara.
 Thank you.
 Francis.
 Ross has not yet returned from Truro.
 'Tis never copper.
 I hardly dare hope but...
 ..yes, yes. I think it may be.
 I must get back to the mine.
 Will you have Ross take a look when he returns?
 Will you not stay and ask him yourself?
 He'll be that relieved.
 It's my dearest wish to be of use to him.
 To make amends.
 You do not ask me what amends I need to make.
 I'm not sure I wish to know.
 - Yet I think I must tell you. - Francis, there's no need.
 Years ago, when the Carnmore Copper Company
 was fighting for its life,
 George came to me one evening.
 Verity had left and I blamed you for her marriage...
 ..and, in my rage, I gave George the names of the Carnmore shareholders.
 I suspect Ross, and you,
 already have some inkling, but...
 ..I've never had the courage to come and tell you outright.
 But you can't rebuild a friendship by ignoring what destroyed it, so...
 So, now you know.
 - I'll go now. - Wait, Francis...
 if we break now, we'll only hurt each other all the more.
 One bad thing does not outweigh the many good.
 'Tis the balance that counts.
 You believe that?
 I don't wonder Ross loves you.
 Do you suppose he still does?
 You doubt it?
 Sometimes, I think he loves Elizabeth better.
 May I tell you something, Demelza?
 You have one failing...
 ..and that is that you don't think well enough of yourself.
 You came here as a miner's daughter and...
 ..married into this ancient family...
 ..and you took its standards as your own.
 So, you mistake your own value.
 Ross was a wise man when he chose you and...
 ..he will not forget it.
 But Elizabeth is...
 so lovely, well bred.
 And she's Ross's first love.
 How can I compete with perfection?
 You must do away with the notion
 that someone...has done you a favour
 by letting you into this family.
 Will you do that?
 I'll try.
 George Warleggan has my promissory note?
 Alas, so...
 ..I'd not expect much sympathy
 for any request to extend the loan period.
 - Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight, sir.
 Is it serious?
 Yes, and physic will not cure it.
 What will?
 Your presence here is what she craves,
 and you have a life elsewhere.
 So, what's to be done?
 In matters of the heart, I think you must be the physician, ma'am.
 Thank you.
 I must leave you tomorrow, Aunt.
 I have a husband and a home to return to.
 But they don't need you as Trenwith needs you.
 It's not as if you have children.
 And the cards...
 today, they threaten some impending ill...
 which perhaps only you can prevent.
 Help!
 Help me!
 HE GRUNTS
 Is there anybody there?!
 Help me!
 HE HYPERVENTILATES
 Help!
 Will Francis be dining with us?
 I've sent to Nampara for him.
 My debt is in the hands of the Warleggans.
 By Christmas, I must find £1,400.
 Or else?
 We lose everything we own
 and I go to debtors' prison.
 Someone come from Trenwith
 lookin' for Mr Francis.
 Is he not at the mine?
 At this hour?
 Help!
 Somebody!
 HE WHIMPERS
 I came as quickly as I could.
 Is it Mr Francis?
 I think he may still be down below.
 No-one's seen him for hours.
 Demelza, wait here.
 HE COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS
 Some of the men saw him heading for the 30 level.
 Then we start there and work our way through.
 Francis!
 ..Thomsons, madam...
 CLOCK TICKS LOUDLY
 Thank you, Prudie.
 Captain Henshawe sent for me.
 Is it an accident?
 Francis is missing.
 DISTORTED LAUGHTER
 Francis!
 Francis!
 Let's try the lower levels.
 Go easy!
 There's still a lot of water down there!
 CLOCK TICKS
 DISTORTED LAUGHTER
 Ross! Help me!
 Ross...
 Francis!
 Francis!
 Francis, are you there?
 - Ross... - Francis!
 Ross?
 - Give me your hand. - I knew you'd come.
 (Ross.)
 Mr Francis?
 Francis!
 Francis.
 Francis.
 HE SOBS
 Francis.
 Why the hell didn't you learn to swim?
 - That's your father's horse, I'll go see if his supper's ready. - I'll go.
