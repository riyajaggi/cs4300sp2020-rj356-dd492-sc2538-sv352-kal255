 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Do you remember that I had an idea? Crowd funding. The town businesses want the school to remain open. If it closes, the town dies. We turn it into an event. - I'm in. - Okay! Allan is highly sensitive. Tomorrow you come over to my place, and Allan stays home. Have you given role playing any thought? When you wear a costume, you dare to do things you didn't dare before. If they want digitalization, that's what they'll get. If we make an effort, we can raise the money.

 Everyone in town has children in this school or has attended this school. I'm doing the lobbying, and Rita is coordinating an event with pupils and parents. Yes, Hjørdis? We can easily conduct classes without being fully digital. Isn't it just a waste of time and money? - No. - Yes. - Yes, it is, Bjarne. - Yes, it is. But it's the municipality's excuse for closing us down instead of one of the other schools. They shouldn't be able to use that sorry excuse. - Exactly. Are you with me? - Yes! Why are you so keen? Aren't you just a substitute teacher? Yes. For now.

 What we need now is a theme. I think... A Viking market. - Yes. I thought... - A Viking market is a better idea. Fine with me. If there are no objections, we'll put on the best Viking market on Saturday. Now we need to get the word out to the town that there'll be activities, entertainment and food and drink. I'm sure we'll raise all the money. Are you with me? Okay! Each class has either a stand or organizes an event. I think my class would like to put on a Viking play. - Perfect. - Yes! Good. Excellent. We're already off to a flying start. This is going to be great. We have to talk about disposable tableware. It's such a waste of resources. CHILDHOOD STREET I can't see it if you can't. Nervous? We have to raise over 500,000 at a Viking market. That can be quite daunting. It can't get worse than it already is. Everyone believes in me right now. They think, "If he says we can do it, we can." Bjarne fixes everything. Did you make that motto up yourself? It's somewhere between a plumber and a hit man. - It's not a tenable business concept. - No. - We have a huge event to organize. - Yes. And lots of parents who think they've knitted the best potholder, so you don't have any time to feel sorry for yourself. PARENT-TEACHER MEETING Now you can breathe a sigh of relief. Thank you. - We're very fond of her. - Bye. Who's next? Rita? Rita, it's your turn. Is your father not here yet? - No. - Okay. Then it's Jimmy's turn instead. Hi, Karin. Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Why didn't you say anything? What do you want me to say? - You could answer when I call. - The school called. Something about a meeting I didn't attend. A parent-teacher meeting that you didn't tell me about. No, I didn't want to... It's not because... Shut the fuck up! Don't lie and tell stories about your old man who just sits around and can't manage anything. I haven't said anything. No, but that's what they bloody well think! The guy whose wife left him and who can't control his kids and... Tongues are wagging. And what do you do? You don't think. You're just like your mother. "It's always me first. Me, me, me." But that's fine. If you don't want to be here, pack your suitcase. I don't need you. BUTCHER Jesus Christ! Hello? - Do you know what time it is? - Nope. It's 5:30am. I was asleep. And that machine is a bit noisy. Is it terribly important to make sausages in the middle of the night? You know what I mean. Should we have waited until you'd had your beauty sleep? - Now that you mention it, yes. - Excuse me. The pork is in the oven. Can... You have to move away from the butcher's. I know, but how? I don't know. There's plenty for sale, and it's cheap... for a reason. - Isn't real estate your thing? - Naw... Not even if I help you find something? Come on. We'll turn it into a project. It'll be great. I say. Come over to the dark side. Old habit. It tastes good. But seriously, Martin can help you. He knows everyone. And I mean everyone. For some reason he loves everything about this town. And so will you. You'll love this place. That might be going too far. - You're the only reason I'm still here. - Really? Apart from my son and my husband. - See you. - See you. - Good morning. - Good morning, sweetie. What are you making? He's still asleep, so I thought I'd bake something. Lovely. Sugar. Have a seat and I'll pour you some mint tea. Uffe, I was wondering. How is role playing going for Allan? Allan? Better. He's getting braver. Okay. That's because he has a strong, masculine role model like you. Why do you ask? Are you worried about him? We're doing a Viking play at school, and I'd like him to play the lead. I see! Did you tell him? - Are you sure that he's ready? - He can do it. But did you ask him? If I ask him, he'll just say no. I can ask some of the role players if they want to be in it. He's comfortable around them. The idea is that the pupils play all the parts. Right, but just let me know. They'll follow their leader to the very death, and school plays. Right. Listen, everyone. I have terrific news. - Is it that we're going to put on a Vik... - A Viking market, yes. It'll be a Viking market and a Viking play, and it'll be just like the real Vikings. So come along. The real Vikings didn't have Viking markets and Viking plays. Fiddlesticks. - Did they even know they were Vikings? - They certainly had markets and plays. Now come with me. Come on. I'm thinking that we put on a play and take 50 kroner per ticket and donate the profits to the school. What do you say? And since the theme is Vikings, it will be about King Canute. Come along. King Canute was king of Denmark and he conquered England and Norway. Although we don't know much about the women during this time, his wife Ælfgifu was super cool and ruled Norway in his name. So we have some good female roles to play. Thilde, you'll be Ælfgifu. And Allan, you'll play King Canute. - Me? - Yes. You're the most experienced actor. Role playing and acting are practically one and the same. But not in front of others who aren't wearing costumes. Their costumes are just normal clothes. - Otherwise I'd like to play him. - Allan volunteered first. - I didn't say a word. - And look at this. We get to borrow costumes from the role-playing club. Hi, kids. Hi, honey. And here we have Rashgul. That was quite a battle we had last Saturday, wasn't it? We have furs, helmets, swords and orc masks. Did they exist in the Viking Age? Yes. Orcs have always existed in the imagination. - There are no orcs in a Viking play. - In a fantasy world... No orcs in a Viking play. Let's see what else we have. Come and have a look. Take a look here. Yes, what have we here? Take a look at this. What do you think? King Canute. There we go. No. No orc or elf-like costumes or props. Take those elf ears off. - But this is fantasy. - No, it's a Viking play, not fantasy. Up, up! VIKING MARKET SUPPORT BAVNEGÅRD SCHOOL Ready, girls? Let's lift it up. Okay. There we go. Hi. - Hi, Hjørdis. - What are you doing? I'm browsing the housing section. So you're staying? Yes, maybe. We'll see. - Do you need any help? - No... Lea said she'd go house hunting with me. She knows the town really well. So, yeah. I'm off. See you later. See you. Say hi to Uffe. And Reinulf. - Can I help you? - No, I'm just looking. Okay. It's for sale. Okay. So, Rita, did you find your father? My aunt said that he was groping her in the bar on Saturday. That's disgusting, isn't it? Rita's dad is so creepy. He gropes everyone. Rita... What is going on here? Rita! What's up? Stop it! - What is going on? - Rita is beating up Jimmy. No, she isn't. We have to talk about this. Rita! Stop it! Leave the room, everyone, and take a break. Now calm down. Take a deep breath. Come with me. - Is everything alright at home? - Yes. You didn't tell your father about the parent-teacher meeting. So? I'd like to know why. Why do you want to know? Because I'd like to be there for you. I'd like to help. You can't. No... I thought you said we were going to drink, not knit. Then don't come with ideas like "We all have to make something that can be sold." I think I'll rob a bank instead. May I present King Canute! Jeez, Dad. - Too much? - Way too much. I don't even know if I want to be in it. Of course you do. If you don't want to, just say no. It's fine. He already said yes. I didn't say a word. Allan, I think you can do it. Come on, Allan... You know what? I don't want to knit, but sometimes you have to do things you don't want to to help others and help yourself. Christ, I'm so wise. So wise. Did you hear that, Allan? Allan? Jesus! - Don't pressure him. - I'm not pressuring him. He can't live the rest of his life in fear. He's in the ninth grade! - He does have a point. - It's my family, not yours. Okay? I'll get back to my drinking. And enjoy the silence. - I'll give it a proper kneading. - It's gonna go, like this. Come here. What is it you're doing? Okay... - Give it all you got. - Now concentrate. We have to bake these or we won't have any dinner. - One down. Come on now. Next. - No... I'll just make one big roll. Is it important? - Huge... - Girls? Come with me. - What is it? - Come along now. Come, I have something to show you. This is just an option. Something we can offer you. - What...? - It's a bedroom. You can use it when you want to. Whenever you want to. You can live with us. We won't interfere in your life when you're not at school or not in the house. WELCOME RITA I want you to know that you can always come whenever you like. Now don't feel bad or think that this is too much. It isn't. So if you like, we're here, the room is here, and our door is always open. Always. But we do have to tell your father about this. - Don't tell him. - Why not? He can't know that I'm moving in here. It's just a room that you can use. But I won't. There will be some colors here as well, right? This is very nice. Hi. No, no, Lukas, put it in the middle. Then people will see it when they come in. Excellent. And plenty of mead. Jens, what are you doing here? Is the municipal council coming to support us? - Support you? - Yes, we're having a Viking market. The whole town is rallying round to show the council that it would be a mistake to close the school. You demand we're fully digital, and we'll do that. You've decided to raise the money yourselves? Yes. Today? It's a lot of money, Bjarne. Yes, it is, but... Why are you here? Bjarne, I just need to check up a few things, so... On a Saturday? The school would be closed if... - It was some logistics... - Logistics? - Yeah, we'll talk about it on Monday. - Bjarne, will you come and help us? Yes, I'll be right there. We'll talk about it on Monday in my office. Okay? On Monday. - I'm coming. - It's like it is stuck. Is it stuck? Well, we can't have that! Okay. Final rehearsal. The audience is settling in. Ready? And... action. Drawing the curtain. Curtain, curtain, curtain. - Where the hell is our king? - I have said, no swearing! - Vikings swear. - Not now. - Where the heck is our king? Is that okay? - Yes, that's fine. Okay. Where the heck is our king? Here. I have come... Further down stage. Good. I have traveled many a mile from England to re-conquer Denmark, so... No. What? So I can re-conquer Denmark. It's Denmark, right? I have traveled far... Can I see the script? Take five, everyone. In half an hour we'll put on the play. - Can we take our costumes off? - No, you cannot. - It's so hot. - Yes, it is hot, creating art. You can snap your fingers and I'll whisper the line. I can't snap my fingers. Then how about gesturing with your hand? No, just read it again. Welcome, one and all. Dear parents, families and business leaders. As you know, this school could be closed if it doesn't become fully digital. And no school means no town. Many of your families have lived here for generations. And they have always fought for this town. And we're continuing the fight. Today we're fighting a mighty battle. That's why we invited you to our amazing Viking market. All the proceeds will go to the school, but it's also possible to give donations. Svend the animal feeder has donated 25,000. And I've just been told that the chamber of commerce has donated 50,000. You know what? Frankly, I think we should turn this into a friendly competition and see who can donate the most. And even more, the biggest donor will have the honor of having the gym named after them. And, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps most important of all... will win this. So how about saving our school today? And a stipulation. You have to wear it. Enjoy your day! Right, girls. Go buy some potholders. - Hi. - We'll call you back, yes. Hi. - How's it going? - See you. - Is the money pouring in? - Yes, are you kidding? - We already have 175,000. - Holy moly. That was quick. You bet. Rita, I think we'll meet our goal. See you. See you. Hello again. What were you doing outside my house? Nothing. Maybe you're interested in buying it. Maybe I used to live there. Did you? - Can't I buy you some mead? - Maybe later. Well, you know where I live. I certainly do. I know where you live. Perhaps I'll come and see my old room. - Be my guest. - Bye. Thanks for coming. Now we have to support Rashgul. - Yes. - Yes. Are we ready? - Everyone ready? - Yes. The play is sold out, so now we go out there and give it our all, right? A real Viking experience, right? A real one... Right. Come on... And... hep hep hep! Good luck. - By Thor and by Odin. - By Thor and by Odin. - We're walking like the blind. - ...blind. Our leader we cannot find. Where is our king? I will ask again. Where the hell... Where is our king? Come on! My mom is here! Way to go, Allan! Come on! "I have traveled from England." I told you it was too much for him. Come on, Allan. Where is our king? Everyone is watching. - Come, Uffe. - Right. At the count of three, I'll take over. One... Two... My liege, methinks you have lost your tongue. What were you about to say to these men whom we just met? I say. What kind of people are you? We're Vikings. What are you? I'm an orc. Come on, Rashgul. You're one of us. You can do this. No more talk! I am your king and I have come to take back my father's throne, which has been taken by role-playing warriors. What? And here they come! That went really well. - A star is born. - Exactly. Oh, come off it, you two. I have to pee. I've had to go for the last three hours. - It went well. - It did. She's very stubborn when it comes to Allan. Fortunately, so are you. Allan, Allan... It would be nice if Lea were more like you. Martin, I don't think you'd really like that. It's the way you say things. You make it sound so easy. That's because I can't be bothered to do the hard stuff. What have you been saying about me? What? You heard me. I haven't said anything. That's a lie. If you hadn't said anything, your teacher wouldn't come around and ask all kinds of questions. Has Susanne been here? You look just like your mother. You have her eyes. And your voice... What do you have of mine? Nothing. - What do you have of mine, Rita? - I don't want anything of yours! Rita! Welcome home. Thank you. Rita... We did it. We raised over 500,000. Bjarne can fix anything. Right? I think so too. And you know what? There's more mead in the barrel. I think Bjarne has had enough. I think I'll go inside and sleep it off on the sofa. You do that. You have saved the school. We saved the school. We saved the school. We saved the school, Rita. - Sleep tight. - Thanks. No thanks, we're not interested in buying anything. - Would you like to come in? - Yes please. Okay. Come in. This way. Cognac or...? Got any beer? Yes. Sorry about the mess. It'll improve with alcohol. I promise. - Do you have children? - Three. Do you like them? It was a joke. - Funny man. - I'm just getting warmed up. - So you've lived here. - Yup. - May I go upstairs? - Sure. - May I bring a beer? - You must. This was my room. My daughter uses it when she's not at her mother's. Don't you want to see my room? What...? - My diary. - Your diary? I don't know if I'll ever come home again. I don't know if I can stay here anymore. Dad says that I'm just like Mom. I ruin everything. I'm moving over to Lea's. They don't see me in the same way. I can be myself there... whoever that is. Okay, you really did just want to see your old room. Yes, a bit... perhaps. - Did it work? - What? Did you become yourself? Well, I became something. Keep the book. Technically it belongs to me, but now I've read the ending. Would you like to buy it? Nah... too many memories. Oh, yes. Ah yes... should we take the main hall too? We'll take that too, yes. ...out in the schoolyard... Yes. We just need to be finished by two, right? Yes. Are you crazy? We don't want to stay longer. No. Yes... You need to take the hallway as well. What...? Who are you? What are you doing here? - We're taking measurements. - What? Taking measurements. What the hell are you taking measurements of? The whole place. All of it. Could you be a bit more specific please? We're taking measurements for the senior housing. - The what? - The senior housing. Yes, and we need to get a move on. Bjarne. I can explain this. What are these people doing here? I wanted to explain earlier. We sold the building. You sold the building? Why the hell didn't you tell me before? I tried, but you were staging an event. I didn't want to be the guy who ruined your Viking market. Forget the Viking market. You can't sell the school! We've tried all sorts of things, but you go on and on, and I must admit that you're good at it. But it has to stop somewhere. Now I get it. You chose this school because you can get the most money for it. It was never about digitalizing or whatever the hell you said. You chose this school because we've taken such good care of it. That how it is, isn't it? Yes, and it'll turn into some lovely senior housing. I'm going to contact the media. Bjarne, there are lots of seniors in the municipality, so it's not really... - You said that we had time. - The deal wasn't final. And we could still do it, right? Hey, you guys. Wait a minute. How long have you known about this? - We're just measurers. - We're just taking measurements. Bjarne, I think we should sit down and talk this through. We just need to take measurements. Listen. This is still my school, and I'd like you to leave right now. Subtitles: Henriette Persson
