 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Rita is moving back to her hometown. It's my old school. You only call on the boys. The girls have had their hands up the whole time. And you're talking about democracy? It makes no sense. If the girls think they deserve to be heard, they'll have to insist. Why can't we collect any of the fun stuff? You don't want to get creepy-crawlies on your fingers, now, do you? It wouldn't surprise me if she eats that kind of thing. Me and Allan's mum, Lea, went here when we were kids. It's a bit complicated. I don't know what happened between the two of you. But it shouldn't affect Allan.

 That half-ogre, half well-meaning counsellor thing... Just drop it. If it's so goddamn important to you, then eat that beetle there! You're just as crazy as you've always been. See you. Morning, boys. What's up? Bavnegård School, Rita speaking... Hello? What's that? Don't you think you should just get in to school? - What was that? - Just a student playing bomb threat. - Bomb threat? - Probably just wanted to get out of PE. - Well, what did they say? - Kalinka, relax. It didn't count as a Muhammad cartoon either when Muhammad from the third grade drew himself, you know? Bjarne!

 SUDDEN THAW Yes, we will. But... Hello! Hey, hey... Quiet! If everyone stays calm and keep their wits about them, I'm sure we'll be fine. In this day and age, do you honestly believe we don't need to take a bomb threat seriously? Listen, I think we need to take any kind of threat seriously. - If it's genuine, that is. - Exactly. I was the one who answered the phone, and as a person who's often had the urge to blow up a school, I can guarantee you that this was an amateur. It doesn't matter if it's an amateur if they're threatening us with something like that. Kalinka, it was nothing. I think it's wrong of you to brush Kalinka aside on such a flimsy basis. No, Niels. You're right. Why don't you pop out to the school yard and dig a bunker? Why... a bunker? What's happening? Nothing. We're done. - Okay, what's happening? - They've received a bomb threat. - Bjarne, we have to evacuate the school. - Oh, come on. - It was a student. - Rita, this is dangerous! - Okay, Hjørdis, now you're being strange. - Yeah... Fine. Listen, everybody. We've either had a terrorist cell buried here in Lundsager, or we're talking about a teenager with a bad hair day. I know which I think it is. I'm leaving. I'm not staying in here. - Bjarne... - Niels? The Cold War is the theme of our project week. And to those of you who need a carrot in order to make an effort, we'll end the week with a bit of a party. But today, dear students, we're going to talk about past and present. About right and wrong. We're going to learn about the Soviet Union and the USA. About dictatorship, communism and democracy. THE COLD WAR After the Second World War, USA was fighting for peace and freedom, whereas Stalin in the Soviet Union was only interested in control and power. Communism wants to control everybody, including you. - This is really boring. - Is there a problem, Lea? Yeah. But it won't go away until 4pm when we're off. Very funny. A joke like that would have cost you your life in the Soviet Union. But you only understand that sort of thing when you've tried it for yourselves. So therefore, it's time for some practical learning. Help me hang these. Get going. That's it. We'll have freedom of speech and democracy here. And dictatorship here. - Why can't Lea and I be on the same team? - Funny you should say that. Many people felt that way when the Iron Curtain was drawn between East and West. Families were separated and destroyed for good. So the short answer is: that's life, my dear. That's a bloody bad reason. And Rita... In keeping with tradition, we'll start by sending you out. No future We've got no future No future at all... Shall we do it one more time? I haven't got time. My chick is here. See you. Are you coming to see the show later? - Do I have to? - You're one of my chicks. You're one of my blokes. BAVNEGÅRD SCHOOL Hello, kids. Find your seats. Albert, the door. Malcolm, sit down. Yeah... good. Today, we're going to talk about full stops. - No... - Yeah, we are. And because you're about to die of excitement, we'll start straight away. Take out Stavevejen 3. Where is Knud? I saw him earlier. Where is he now? Niels and Kalinka came and got him because of that bomb thing. What? They said he couldn't be here, because there is a bomb threat. Is there? No, Beatrice. There isn't. Why are Kalinka and Niels talking about it, then? Primarily because they're stupid. And now to the full stops. Yes, Albert? I don't want to be here if there's a bomb. Well, there isn't. You'll have to tell them to evacuate the school, Rita. Sit down, Beatrice. But the number of terror attacks in Europe has gone up like mad over the last five years. Okay. But you need to sit down now. Otherwise, I'll blow up. Fine. Okay. Right now, we're in a place that can best be described as a suburb of a field. No one knows that we exist, and therefore no one wants to blow us up. But Kalinka says... "Kalinka says" is the title of a book that no one should ever read, because it's full of plot holes and holier-than-thou characters. Go to page nine. "Rasmus saw a cow." MAIN ENTRANCE - Hi. - Hi. - Are you allowed to smoke here? - No. That thing you said earlier, right...? - I've said a lot of things today. - Yeah, but... about me. - What did I say about you? - That I was strange. Well, you know what you're like. Right? Yes, but this might come as a shock to you, but I've got feelings as well. Both for myself and others. Yeah. Of course. And I'm just thinking... Uffe and me, are we strange? Okay. How's that going to affect Reinulf, then? Uffe sometimes dresses up Reinulf as an orc. Okay, that might be a bit... And then they act out the Battle of Zatvz'ashin together. - Hjørdis? - Yes. It's only strange if you think it is. But I don't know what I think. I like it when other people tell me. Okay. It is a bit strange, actually. - See you. - Yeah, bye. SCHOOL REUNION PARTY 2017 BAVNEGÅRD SCHOOL FRIDAY 31/03 7PM IN THE CANTEEN So...? Did you fix the Cold War? My mum hates him. That's why he's placed you in the Soviet Union. He's a jerk. - He's so hot. - Rostrup? No! Ronny. Okay... I think he's mega cute. How... how long have you had a crush on him? Not that long. Two years, maybe. Two years? Why haven't you said anything to him? I can't. I think he's really difficult to pull. Boys are a bit like puppies, you know? In what way? They're very cuddly and stuff. Are you saying that Ronny is cheap or...? He's a boy. - Have you been with him? - Have I what? Have you been with him? - Yeah, well... - But you've only just started here! Did you kiss or what? When? It was... a bit earlier. - Today? - Yeah. - You're the cheap one! - Lea, listen. I didn't know that... - Bloody hell. - What's wrong, Ulrik? - I forgot my packed lunch. - That's not a problem. You're living in a country which is free and full of resources. And in the Soviet Union, they like to share everything. You can't be serious? It's his. Oh, yes, I'm very serious. Could I have your lunch? Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. That's it. Choose some goodies from here and give out the rest to your red comrades. Hey! That one's mine. I want you to participate in the lesson like a good student. Lea... Have some of my pork scratchings. While Rostrup isn't looking. Come on, Lea. Are you still upset about that thing with Ronny? - Damn it, Lea... - Rita! USA doesn't trade with the Soviet Union. No. I guess not. Hjørdis? Sweetie. Sweetie pie! - Hjørdis? Sweetie? Hi. - Hi. - You're hiding, eh? - Well... yes. We've been in the woods all day. - What about Reinulf? - He was brilliant. - Oh, God. - Oh, yes. We're gonna go shopping now. Wanna come? - Like that? - Yeah. - But you're dressed up. - Yeah. Yeah... I'll take this one, then. Okay? No. I was planning on putting all the stuff in the pram. Oh, okay. I'll just take Reinulf, then. Then you can fit in more things. - You're a little warrior. A kiss? - Bye. See you back home. Okay. Later, then. Yes... - Hi. - Hi. - Are you waiting for Allan? - Yeah. Well, the last time we saw each other, I ate a beetle. SCHOOL REUNION PARTY - Are you going? - To the school reunion? I'm not sure. No... I don't think... I think we're away that weekend. - Yeah. Of course. - We're doing something else. Sure. It was just an idea. - See you. - Yes. Bye. Bye. - Hi, sweetie. - Hi. - Hi. Where's Reinulf? - He's asleep. What are you doing? It was really hard getting this make-up off. Have you washed him? Yes. Wasn't I supposed to? No, because we're going to the woods tomorrow. We're in the middle of a big crusade. But I think it might be good for Reinulf to stay home. You've always said it was good for Reinulf to get some fresh air. Yes, but people are staring, Uffe. What? Are we strange? What do you mean? I think we are. With all this roleplaying and Elvish... You've never cared about what people were saying. - I know. But what if Reinulf gets bullied? - Why would he? Because children will bully each other about anything, Uffe. Really... If Reinulf's parents are weird, he'll become weird as well. - Well, I was never bullied. - No. You were homeschooled. Uffe, you grew up on a farm in the middle of nowhere. You're like... Mowgli. Hjørdis, honestly... We can't be anything other than ourselves. No. But maybe we could try. No one would leave a sports bag lying out like that. But if it is a bomb, how much damage will it do? Really? - No, Rita. Stop! - No, Rita. Stop her! - Stop her, someone who knows her. - Stop, Rita. A pair of headphones and a very dangerous book on aquarium fish. Okay? Oh, that's good. I think it's difficult, all that terror stuff. I didn't use to be so scared. You're a mum now. It drives you crazy. But I'm going to be a mum the rest of my life. - Am I going to be scared all the time? - That's where alcohol comes in. - Bye. - Bye. Hi. I'm sorry about yesterday. It's just... a school reunion party. The past. Not exactly my favorite period. Sure. I'm going. Okay. Your teaching methods are pretty intense. I found it necessary to apply some slightly alternative methods to make the kids understand what's going on in the world around them. That is my job, after all. It's not your job to take food from your students. No one was starving. Well, today is the last day of our little experiment, and I hope you've learned something. I'm sure you have. You've experienced the division between East and West firsthand. So go to the party tonight. Enjoy the fact that you live in a country where you can eat whatever you want. Go to the toilet when you want. Enjoy life. - Are we done now? - Yes. After the Soviet Union has served on the USA all evening. I'm not going to serve the others all night. - It's outside school hours. - Socialism does not keep track of time. And my mum says this is stupid. Someone has to make sure you're not indoctrinated. That's ridiculous. Fine. You're off the hook. - Soviet won't go at all. - What? - Sit down. - No. You'll spend the evening in an empty classroom, while the rest of us party. - You can't make us do that. - No. But I can give you written assignments for the rest of the year if you don't do as you're told. You'll try what it's like growing up in a gulag. That's a Soviet forced-labor camp. You should all know that. Lea, stop! Lea... Seriously. I don't want to go that party either, if you're not coming. Lea... Could you please just shut up? SCHOOL REUNION PARTY Any Russians here who are up for a party? Come on. It's so boring with just half the class there. - Rostrup will be so pissed off. - I've got a plan. Come on! What about Lea? Wait here, okay? Why didn't you come down? I don't want to go to Rostrup's shitty party. Listen, I've just liberated the whole of the Soviet Union, just so that my only friend, my hottest and best friend, can make out with Ronny from the tenth grade. I'm just not very good at that kind of thing. Lea, listen... Ronny is an idiot who won't realize that you fancy him unless you drag him to the toilet and snog the hell out of him. I mean... He's also sweet and dishy and all that stuff, but he's stupid. All boys are. And most girls. But you're not stupid. You're just scared. - What if it goes wrong? - Then it goes wrong. Come on. I look like shit. We'll fix that. You can borrow my top, and we'll put some make-up on you. - Hi. - Hi. What a party. Yes. Have you talked to anyone from back then? Yes, I talked to Jeanette. Remember how stylish she looked back then? God, yeah. Now she looks like an extra from "Everybody Loves Debbie." I wish I'd known back then. I spent years trying to imitate her. "Experience is the comb that life gives you when you go bald." - What about you? - What about me? - What have you been doing? - Oh... I became a school teacher. Primarily for the money. And you? Eh... I became a building technician. Yeah. You went for the money. I went for the big adventure. - Are you married? - Yeah. With the first one I met. - Martin. - Martin. - I don't presume that you are...? - No. - And thank you. - You're welcome. They thought it was mega cool when they threw all that... - See you, Uffe. - See you, Uffe. Bye, bye, Uffe. - What's going on? - Nothing. - Uffe? - No. You know what? I didn't see it before, or maybe I didn't care, but now, you've infected me with this stupid self-awareness. Now I'm constantly considering what other people are thinking, and... It's like being... scared all the time. Right? And... - Thanks a lot! Thank you. - Uffe... Yeah. Thank you for that! They look up at the sky What do they see? Planes are crashing to the ground No one has survived It's a new time, it's the future It's all the things the rest of us don't know about Where are we going? What now, my friend? It's a future which is still unknown... Which is still unknown The clouds are gathering over the Earth... - Are you ready? - Maybe... Yes. Right. I'm ready. That dust cloud that has come down from the future... What are you doing here? They're political refugees. They were so desperate for a life in freedom that they defected. Just like the ones who went across the Wall. You're not going to send them back to communism, are you? Turn down the ones who've risked everything just to live like us? Alright. You've been granted amnesty. It's my future In you go. You're brave. I've got to give you that. You have to be to end the Cold War. Fuck... - There's my seat. - And mine. - Shit, it's a long time ago. - Yeah. It was a different life. We had fun, didn't we? Most of the time. Ronny? It's what the others... - Hi, chicks. - Hi. - Weren't we in the same class? - Close. - I banged one of you, didn't I? - No. We stole your moped. Remember that? Well, then? Are you up for banging today? - No, thanks, Ronny. - I'm going to stand down as well. - Cool. You don't know what you're missing. - No. Exactly. Enjoy the party. See ya! Jesus Christ... Some things never change. No. Or do they? Maybe they do. - Cheers. - Cheers. It's a good day It's a future It's... Hjørdis... Me not Hjørdis. Me Ogok. You're an orc! Ogok hungry. Well... Sweetie, are you going in to work like that? Yeah. Why not? Well, because... You said we were too strange, and... Yeah. But I would rather do what you say than what I say. But... Uffe... We're the kind of people who dress up. And Reinulf can do that as well if that's what he wants. Period. Yeah... - There's no time for that, honey. - Can't we just...? No. I love you. Good morning, Beatrice. Do you need a hand? Let's see... I think it's this one. There you go. After you. I'll do the alarm for you. Where did you get these? From the staff room. Did you steal them? Come with me for a sec. Beatrice, do you watch the news at home every now and then? A bit. - And then you get scared? - Yeah... And then you want others to be scared, too? No? Okay. Then I don't understand. I was supposed to go to Paris for Easter with my mum and dad, but I didn't want to go. And then I thought they were going to stay home. But they're not. Okay. But I don't want them to go. It's dangerous. And then you thought that if you said there was a bomb, they would cancel the trip to Paris? I'm sorry. It's okay. It's perfectly okay. - It was me who called, too. - Yeah, I thought I recognized that voice. I don't understand why they're not scared. They're parents. Trust me. They're scared. Why can't they just stay home, then? Because you can't live your life that way. There will always be something which is dangerous or scary and... You just have to try and live with it, as best you can. The best thing you can do, when you're scared of something, is to do exactly the thing you're scared of. Do you know what I've been scared of? This town. It's true. You probably don't think it's dangerous, but... I did some really stupid things here at one point. And because of that... ...this town felt dangerous to me for a very long time. So if I can go to Lundsager, then you can go to Paris. It's exactly the same. - Almost. - Almost. Thanks for the chat, Beatrice. Go down to your class. See you. No, Hjørdis! You're really strange, Hjørdis. Subtitles: Henriette Persson
