 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES - Alright? - Absolutely. - The consultant was enthusiastic. - Great. Now we just have the hearing left. We'll give it our all. The school will survive. End of story. What are you doing here? Hi, Lea. I don't know why you're back. Allan's needs are none of your business. Do you know each other? - No. - Yes. The Cold War is the subject of our theme week.

 - This is so boring. - Something wrong, Lea? Yes, but it won't go away until 4pm when we get out of school. We had fun. Most of the time. "The wretched woman hid in the bushes until the carriage had passed by." Write the word "wretched." "When the coast was clear, she made her way down to the passageway." Write the word "passa...". This dictation is practically antique. I'll find something else. I'll check out the school's Facebook page. Right. Okay. "My son has complained that the school's internet is so slow that he can't watch movies during the breaks." Write the word "breaks." "The toilets are super gross and stink of rotten dog dick."

 Write the word "rotten." "The school's worst 'ideot' is Knud." "The school's worst 'ideot' is Knud in 5B. He's nasty as hell." Posted by Liam. - So? - Let's skip that you can't spell "idiot" and move on to the fact that that kind of language isn't allowed here. Knud, what's going on? - Nothing. - Liam? TRUE FRIENDS It's a shame when one is so good at it. - Hey. - Hi. I was just wondering if you talk to Knud about bullying. No. Who is he bullying? No, he's being bullied. By Liam, the new pupil. Isn't it just harmless teasing? The class says it takes place on Facebook and during the breaks. It's also physical. I'll contact Liam's father. I just wanted you to know. - I think that might be going too far. - I think so too. So you don't think I should? Let's be careful about concluding who the victim is here. - Yes, who is the real victim? - What the hell do you mean? He's from a very socially disadvantaged family. They have moved around a lot. His father is unemployed. That doesn't give him a free pass to act like a gang member. No, but we don't know what's behind it. We have to be sympathetic to people from different backgrounds. It's about seeing the big picture. We'll talk to Knud, and I'm sure he'll agree that Liam can't help it. - He can't help it at all. - Oh, yes, he can! Rita, I think your privileged life is blinding you. Holy shit! I told my mother that Ronny's parents are going too. And Ronny told his parents that he's taking Jan and Mulle with him. It's like we're Bonnie and Clyde. But without robbing banks and murdering people. What are you going to do while you're up in that summer cottage, you and Ronny? I've decided that Ronny is going to be my first. Are you going to screw all weekend? What's up, girls? There's room enough for three here. No. Dad, we don't have any food. I have to go to work. I'll be home late, so don't wait up. - Aren't you going? - Yes. - Is that Rita's invitation? - Yes. Hjørdis, it's Reinulf's first birthday. I don't think he cares about written invitations. - Can't you just invite her in person? - No. It's important that she feels welcome and that she knows she's not alone. She seems like she's fine to me. That's Rita for you. She has an armor... of armor. An armor made of armor that she hides behind. Done! - All done. - All done. - Hey, give me some sugar. - Sugar. - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. See you tomorrow, Hjørdis. Can I have your attention. I'd like to remind you that the municipal hearing is tomorrow. It's our big chance to be heard before they decide which school to close. It's crucial for everyone to come and show our enthusiasm. I'll go home and practice being enthusiastic. - I haven't tried it before. - Okay. See you tomorrow. Everyone practice their enthusiasm for tomorrow... Rita. I just wanted to invite you to Reinulf's first birthday. - Wow. Hjørdis, wow. - Those are real feathers. Lovely. I wanted to personalize it. - Reinulf is very excited. - Is he? Uffe is baking a cake that will look like Helm's Deep... that is, if it rises enough. Otherwise it'll be Helm's Field. Reinulf will be so pleased if you come. And so will I. - Of course. I'll look forward to it. - Super. His wish list is on the page behind the secret door. - Hi. I had fun the other day. - Me too. You didn't have to drive all the way over here to tell me. - I know. I'm here to pick up Allan. - Can't he walk the whole 400 meters home? Could we have some beers... some more? - I'd love to. - Great. When? Since I don't have any friends, it's easy. How about tonight? Tonight is family night. So any other night for the rest of my life. You can come for dinner. Family night sounds like it's just for the family. Yes, but we serve alcohol. - What time did you want me to come? - At 7pm. See you. See you. Bye, Allan. Liam, knock it off! It's not funny. What's up, boys? Are you playing a kissing game? School is out for the day. But that doesn't mean I'm out of your hair. Explain what's going on. We're just playing. Okay. What do you say, Knud? Are you just playing? That's funny. When I was a kid, we thought that playing was fun. Are you having a good time? Liam, teasing other kids might have been a way of making friends at your old school, - but we won't allow it here. - I don't want to be friends with him. Take a minute and then apologize to Knud and leave him alone. - I didn't do anything. - Yes, you did! - Shut up, idiot. - Stop saying that! "Stop saying that!" Liam! Enough! Are you okay? Hi. What can I do for you? I brought this over for Lea. - Okay. Right. - Who is it? Hi, Rita. Hi. I brought this over for Lea. Lea already left. Ronny picked her up on his moped. - Okay. - His parents are going up there later. Okay. Would you like to stay for dinner? That is, if your parents aren't expecting you. No, I'm alone at home. I have money for pizza. We're having pork tenderloin. - What? - You're famished. Yes. - It's fine. - Knock yourself out. Rita, how about your family? What do you mean? Your parents, what do they do? Do you have any brothers or sisters? I have a little sister. - I think I should be heading home. - Already? Don't you want dessert? But if my father is home... I thought you were home alone. - I am. - Then you should stay for ice cream. Are you often home alone? I don't know. Why do you ask? I think it's important for you to have an adult to talk to. About what? All kinds of things. Whatever you like. About how you are doing. I'm fine. Henrik speaking. Hi, baby girl. That's funny. We were just talk... - Is that Lea? - Yes. Take it easy. One thing at a time. No, I can't drive right now. - Hi. It's me. - Hey! Yes. Okay, stay there. I'm on my way. What's going on? It's just Ronny and Lea and... I have to go up there. Go up there? Aren't his parents there? Rita... - Are you sure I can't help you? - Only by drinking wine. My favorite job. - Hi. - Hi. - Martin. - Rita. Welcome. I had no idea that Lea had a friend called Rita. - It's only been... - Thirty years. Thirty years since we've seen each other. My goodness! Thirty years. Do you have any other secrets? Careful, Martin. They'll be divulged if you open a bottle of wine. You should have come over sooner. What's she doing here? You. What are you doing here? You don't refer to a person in the room in the third person. I'm his teacher. Allan, your mother invited me for family night. - You're not family. - She could be. - Does that mean you're going to screw? - Allan, stop it. - Dinner is ready. - Yes. Lovely. What's first? Do we screw first or eat first? She's not answering. It's turned off. God, what if something's happened to her? What if she got drunk and fell into the harbor? Or dropped a cigarette in bed and set it on fire? No. Do you know what? What if a huge scarab turned her into a big lump of meat that's rolling along on the pedestrian street? How big can they get? Hjørdis, I'm sure she's fine. Then why didn't she come? Why turn off her phone? I don't know. And now that Reinulf's birthday is over with, there's something I'd like to talk to you about. - Does it have anything to do with Rita? - Well... no. Then I'd rather wait till tomorrow. It's not like her to turn off her phone. - Thanks for a lovely dinner. It was yummy. - You're welcome. I have more wine if you like. No, I think... It's getting late. You promised secrets about her. Martin wants me to have a dark and wild side that he hasn't experienced. Okay. Martin, she has a dark and wild side that you haven't experienced. - My point exactly. More wine! - No, I have to go. No. I really have to go. No way. I want to hear everything. - Martin, some other time. - Coward. There's a reason why I'm 45 and living alone. - I take off when it gets too hot. - Too hot? Is that why you moved away back then? Yes, in a way I guess. - How's that? - Martin... She doesn't want to talk about it. - Then what can we talk about? - I don't know. Fear of flying, people making mistakes, big cocks. Those are my favorite subjects. Will you stay this time...? - That is, if I may ask about it. - You may. I always thought that this was a shitty town, and it was a good thing I left, but... maybe the town wasn't shitty, I was. What the hell do I know? I don't know jack shit. But I do know that I'm going home to bed. Thanks for a lovely evening. Lea, are you crazy? I'm freezing my butt off out here. Lea, let me in. - What did you do to her? - I didn't do anything! Rita... Rita, let me in for Christ's sake! - Let's go in here. - Rita! Lea! I didn't know what to do. Did he rape you? No. Did he hurt you? Then what did he do? He... tried to finger-fuck me. And then I had second thoughts. It's fine. How about letting him in again? - Crazy bitches! - We just let you back inside. What the fuck? I was freezing my butt off out there for hours. Listen. Lea is sorry that she locked you out. Aren't you? But she doesn't want to have sex with you. Why not? I just don't want to. She just doesn't want to. I spent money on gas for the moped and on condoms and everything. You should pay half. I paid for the condoms. - Honestly, Ronny... - It's not fair. It's not such a big deal. Will you have sex with me instead? Give me two minutes. What the hell? Girls, come up here a sec. Are you nervous or what? What's it to you? Have you been expelled from a school before? What's it to you, I said. Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. - No worries. - It's fine. I'm just glad you could come, so we could talk about how the boys are behaving. I'm sorry that Liam has hit Knud and teased him. I apologize for that. I've been talking to him, and it won't happen again. Perfect. That was surprisingly easy. You don't have to apologize. We do. What do you mean? After everything you've all been through, this can't have been easy. Been through? All the moving around and Liam changing schools so many times. Moving a couple of times doesn't mean that it's okay to bully and beat others. No. Exactly. That's all there is to it. Let's... We're just saying that it's important to take Liam's feelings into consideration. And his father's. Søren, isn't it? We're just acknowledging that things are rough for you. Who says things are rough for us? You're unemployed, and you've moved several times. Our competitive society puts a lot of pressure on families like yours. Families like ours? We aren't criticizing you. We're considering your situation. Kalinka and I obviously have access to privileges that you don't have. And that's why I can't raise my son properly? That's not what we're saying. Now you're taking the blame for it all again. - Whose fault could it otherwise be? - I'd like to know, too. Okay. The theory is a bit complicated. I just might be able to understand it even though I don't have access to your privileges. No, that's the point. There are invisible power structures for which those of us in the cultured classes share the responsibility. So now being a school teacher is cultured. It's more cultured than... It depends on what he does. We don't know. He might read newspapers. What the hell are you on about? You and your son are subjected to micro aggressions from society. We're taking responsibility for that. From a structural point of view, our son is bullying yours. From a structural point of view, this conversation is over. The only thing we want to do is to help you. I haven't asked for your help. I just wanted to apologize. There's nothing to apologize for, is there? Sorry. Okay? I don't think you'll be expelled. You just hit people because you don't have any friends. Neither do I. But you're weird. I have the new Call of Duty. Do you play? Pardon me, Miss Madsen, but if you're heading for the municipal hearing, you're going in the wrong direction. I haven't practiced my enthusiasm. We have to stick together if we want to survive as a school. I'm not keen on those local authority types. I don't have fond memories of them. I know. What do you know? I called your former boss before I called you in for an interview. Rasmus? Okay. Helle. - No, I called the mayor. - Ouch! - What she had to say wasn't nice. - Likewise. She said that you were the most stubborn, most irritating person she had ever met. That's why I hired you. It takes stubbornness if a school is to survive in a place like this. - I don't think stubbornness is enough. - No. Of course stubbornness isn't a quality in itself. But Christ, Rita! Fight for what you believe in. I thought at least you would support that. And what if I don't believe in it? This is your hometown. It's where you're from, for better or for worse. You'd never be the person you are if you hadn't grown up here. For fuck's sake, Rita. Come on. - Coming, Bjarne? - Coming. - I believe in you. - Right. A very warm welcome to everyone. It's great to see so many familiar faces. It proves what a spirit of solidarity we have at this school. I'd like to thank Jens Møller from the city council for setting up this hearing. I'd also like to thank the members of the city council for taking the time to attend this hearing. Our first speaker is Elmer from grade 1B. He'd like to tell us why he loves to go to this school. I love to go to school because it's great. The teachers are nice and recess is fun. I'd also like to thank Bjarne and the rest of you for coming. As you know, one of the municipality's schools has to close. This is your opportunity to ask the council questions as well as ask Bjarne about his cost-cutting plan. What's this about merging classes from different grades? Yes, but it's only necessary in certain subjects if we are to stay open. - That doesn't hold water. - Socially, that's a mess. Not having a school could also be said to be a social mess. I'm convinced that it's possible without compromising on quality. I have promised this town that I'd do everything in my power to keep our school open. You can count on me. - May I say something? - Yes, Rita. I'm a new teacher at this school. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Rita. Before coming here, I was a teacher and the principal of Islevgård School. We were under a lot of pressure, just like you are, but we turned it into something positive. We created a special inclusion class for children in different grades. For example, a 7th grader would teach a geography lesson to 3rd graders. That's how they learned something and took responsibility for each other's learning. I think this town will have to do the same thing if the school is to survive. Thank you, Rita. - Hi. - Hi. - It's so nice to see you. - You too. I was rather worried when you didn't turn up at the birthday. The birthday? Yes, Reinulf's first birthday party. Shit! - When was it? - Yesterday. It's a bit risky sending out invitations on the very day. I know, but it took a long time to make it. - I'm sorry. I have a lot on my mind. - It's okay. I know it isn't easy. Isn't easy? I know you're not doing so well. What are you on about? I'm fine. It doesn't seem like it. You're not yourself. I'm fine, Hjørdis. And this is me. - Are you sure you're okay? - I'm fine. If I wasn't, it'd be my problem. We moved here so you wouldn't feel all alone. What? Did you move here for my sake? Jesus Christ, Hjørdis. Now listen to me. You two should live your lives, and I'll live mine. I'm fine and I'll stay here. If you two moved here for my sake, then go back home. Yes... Hjørdis, I don't need your help. I don't want it! Okay? I... See you later. Well, girls... Is there something you'd like to tell us? I just want to say that I know it was stupid to run off like that. Yes, it was very stupid. Anything could have happened. - But Rita helped me... - Let your mother finish. Yes, Rita did help you. We think it's wonderful that you have a friend who is responsible and looks out for you. - Don't we, Henrik? - Yes, we do. - So you're not mad at us? - Yes, we are. - But you're not grounding me. - Yes, we are. Oh, honestly... You lied to us, Lea. Both of you lied to us. For us to be a family, we have to be honest with each other. Do you understand? Yes. What about you, Rita? Right. Then that's the end of that, isn't it? Yes, but we'd like to know why there's a moped in the driveway. Your parents are pretty cool. They're okay. What were you doing here when I called? Things are just really screwed up at home. My mother took off. What? My dad says that we shouldn't count on her coming back. You can stay here as often as you like. And as long as you like. Hey. What are you doing here? Your neighbor said that you'd probably be here. Wow! I brought some beer. - I'm glad you said that at the hearing. - Thanks. I didn't think you liked it here. I mean, I wasn't sure why you came back. But do you like it here? This place hasn't changed a bit. But I have. - You sure as hell haven't. - I damn well have. - I damn well haven't. - No, you damn well haven't. Well... I haven't had any friends... not real friends since back then. Not in the way that... So when you ask me if I like it here... I have the best memories from here... and I have the worst memories from here. Hey there. Well, it's a good thing I bought some extra wine. Hi, dear. - And we have beer. - Hi, Rita. Cheers. Welcome aboard. Thank you. You can go on your iPad if you want. Half an hour on the iPad, half an hour music. We need some time for ourselves as adults, so we can hear all the stories. - There aren't any stories. - Hold on there. I remember several times when you led the way to skinny dipping, skinny dipping at night with quite a high level of Pisang Ambon in your blood. - Here we go. - I had forgotten that. The only thing I remember is flashbacks of experimenting with poodle permanents. Can we rewind to the bit about skinny dipping? What about you, Martin? - I've never been skinny dipping. - Then what? You must have done something. Oh, I don't know. I've been Lea's boyfriend since I was 21. And before her, Anita was my girlfriend. We were engaged. And before Anita was Dorthe. We went steady in 7th grade, - and before that... - Dear? She didn't ask for a fact sheet. I have nothing more to say! Holy shit. I'm not keen on skinny dipping. What the hell are you doing, dear? I've had it! Quiet! I just put Reinulf down. - I have had it. - What's wrong? It's a stupid place, a stupid job, a stupid town and a stupid... Rita? How did you know? It must be my finely tuned sixth sense, sweetie. I just want to go back to our old apartment, my old job and all the other old stuff. Hjørdis, I have to tell you something. Did you have an affair? It's Bitten from role playing, isn't it? To hell with her and her fancy coat of mail. Hjørdis, I didn't have an affair. I love you very much. And I love Reinulf ever so much, but... What? I got a job. You what? My dream job. Where? Here. As a ranger. Klaus from the role-playing group pulled a few strings. Big Klaus? The one who always does tricks? Yes. I know we came here for your sake, but now it's my turn to ask if we can't give this place a chance. Congratulations! Oh, dear. Sorry. Isn't it amazing? - Good morning. - Good morning. Did I miss anything at the hearing? A bunch of frightened parents and rambling politicians. How did they react to your cost-cutting plan? My plan will work, and they know that, but they have to close a school, so they're looking for a reason to close us down. Someone mentioned that our IT wasn't up to par, but that of the other schools was, - so now it's their reason. - Bullshit. Yes, it is bullshit. Let me guess. They won't pay for it, will they? No. We'll have to bring it up to par, so they don't have that excuse. - How? - I have an idea. - Which is? - Which is secret. - So you don't have one? - I'll figure something out. - See you. - Have a good one. - Hi, Søren. - Hi. If the grown-ups can't figure it out, they'll have to do it themselves. I don't think I've ever seen him concentrate on anything before. That's looking good. Things haven't been easy for him. We moved a lot. I hope you stay. This place isn't so bad. Subtitles: Henriette Persson
