 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES It's for sale. - So you've lived here. - It's my room. I'm moving in with Lea where I can be myself. Whoever that is. Welcome home. Do you want to have sex with me? Rita... Hey, hey... I'm glad you're back. You and I have the same outlook on the world. Obviously not. - Yes, Bjarne? - They're closing the school, Rita!

 Liam! Hey, Liam! Liam, now stop it! Stop it! Come on now. Take it easy. Yes, go ahead and kick the door. It can take it. What's wrong, Liam? I don't want to move again! I see. There now. The door has had enough. Who says you're moving? The school is closing. And you all said I could stay. I'm sorry, but we did everything we could to save the school, - but it wasn't enough. - I don't want to move. - I thought I could stay here. - I thought I could too, but that's the way it goes. There's nothing we can do about it. I have to move too. And I even bought a big house. It sucks. Liam. Liam. Hey!

 HOME - Right. So... - Excuse me. Where was he last seen? In the teachers' lounge late at night. - Did he take the money? - Yes, he's been reported missing. The contributors have reported him for fraud. What about the school? It's going to be converted into senior housing. How do you think the town will survive without a school? Yes. Honestly! My job is to keep a budget. The municipality has lots of other good schools. The pupils will be offered a place there. So if that's it... It's fine. You have a legal proviso. You have three days to make any objections before the sale is final. Phew! Thanks. - What are you going to do? - I don't know. - Can't you get another job? - In three days? You can't move now, damnit! - What's going on, Lea? - Not a damn thing. I'm just stuck. I'm so fucking tired of this place, and Martin loves it and never wants to leave. You can't leave me here again. What happened after I moved out? You ruined the family. Or the two of you did. I know you did it with my dad, but I saw him every day and saw how much he regretted it. But you were just gone. I hated you so much. So much that I couldn't tell how much I missed you. I missed you too. - Have you forgiven me? - Yes. Hi. Hi. I have to... - Won't you stay for dinner? - We could barbecue. Thanks, but no. I have to prepare classes. Thanks for your help. - Hi. - Hi, Hjørdis. - What's wrong? Where's Reinulf? - He's fine. He's upstairs sleeping. - What's wrong? - I heard that the school is closing. - Yes... - Come here. Uffe, I'm not upset. No... you're in shock. But bodily contact always helps. Uffe, I'm not upset and I'm not in shock. I'm actually relieved. I've never felt better. I feel like I've been rescued. Rescued? From what? - From Rita. - From Rita? I don't have to be around her or work with her every day. I can start all over somewhere else. Hi, Reinulf! Here comes Mommy... Hey... What about my job? It might not exist anymore once the school is gone. I can take the job at the continuation school where Allan will go. - But... - Hi, Reinulf. But Hjørdis... Hjørdis! Who the hell could that be? Coming! - No. - We have to talk. - While Lea sits at home waiting? - She thinks I'm on the boat. - Can I come in? - No. I'm not leaving until we've talked. It will be a short conversation. Very short. You can't keep acting like nothing has happened. Nothing has happened, so it's easy. I told you that I have feelings for you. The only feelings I have are hunger, fatigue and mild irritation, so it's not a good investment, Martin. I know that you're attracted to me. What's that? Hold that thought. I'm going to make some popcorn. This is going to be fun. You flirt with everyone. Yes. Animals, men, women and the red man in the traffic lights. And so what? - You've never flirted with me. - So? So either you're attracted to everyone including the traffic lights and men, or you're the type that flirts with everyone except the one you want. I'm pretty sure that's the kind of logic that got witches burned at the stake. Because just imagine if you lost control. What would you do? You think I'm afraid that Lea will leave me. I'm not. Yes, you are. The only way I can prove it is by leaving her. Then you'll see that it isn't fear or whatever you think. Martin, don't do it. Hey! Don't you dare leave her. I've ruined plenty in her life! Shit! What do you mean? What did you ruin? Martin, you're right that I haven't flirted with you, but not for the reasons you think. I... I don't have the same feelings for you. So what did you ruin? Tell me, Rita. What did you ruin? You asked what happens when I lose control. Yes. What happens? Rita... Rita, are you asleep? Hi. Did I wake you? I drove all night. I just wanted to come home. And I thought that you and I needed to talk. I'm so sorry about the things I said. I know it's no excuse, but... I was so upset about my mother being sick and... But that's no excuse for saying what I did. Of course you'll always have a room here. For just as long as you need it. Tell her what you did. - Hi, sweetheart. You're up. - Tell my mother what you did. Did something happen while I was away? Tell her! What's going on, Lea? What is going on? Rita... Rita, stop... Stop! - No! Let me go! - Stop! - Tell me what you did. - You brought it on yourself. - What did I do? - You shouldn't have said that. Let me go! Susanne! Let her go for fuck's sake! - What did I say? - You shouldn't have said that. She fucked Dad. Lea... Susanne... I'm sorry. Get out of here. Go away! - Su... - Don't touch. Do not touch me. - Lea... - Come here. Lea... - Come along, sweetheart. - I'm sorry. Go away. Now! I'm sorry. - Jeppe, she can hear it. - Then why doesn't she open up? Surprise! - Hi. What are you doing here? - We wanted to help you pack. That's so nice of you. Hi. And you brought boxes. I have plenty of my own. And then you'd start using plastic bags or something. I'm not buying the house after all because the school is closing. - What? - Yup. - What are you going to do? - I don't really know. - Are you okay? - Yes. I'm fine. I'm just fine. - You haven't even unpacked. - No. And now I don't have to. It's so good to see you. I know I shouldn't say this about your mother, but what Hjørdis is doing just isn't fair. First she dragged us all the way out here, and when we finally find out feet, she wants to uproot us again. But you know what? Dad is going to put his foot down. That's what a real man does. He lets people know what he wants and doesn't want. He's strong and puts his foot down! Both of us have to do that, Reinulf. We'll put our foot down. Da... Da... Did you just say dad? Did you say dad? Dad promises that he'll fight. We aren't going to be uprooted again. We refuse to be. - See you tomorrow, Rita. - See you. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. - Allan is free. - Yes. I was wondering if you wanted to tell me something. - About what? - I don't know. Something that is important for me to know. Rita... Stephanie, I can't talk right now. Can we go over here? Okay, what did Martin say? I don't know. What should he say that would interest me? I don't know. He came over twice, and I sent him home both times. And you didn't think to tell me? No, I didn't, Lea. There was nothing to tell. I sent him home. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I... You told him that you wrecked my life and then you sent him home. Yes, I told him that to convince him that he shouldn't... - Shouldn't what? - Nothing. Shouldn't what? Shouldn't leave you. So my husband wanted to leave me. Let's assume he has the balls to do so. - And you didn't think you should tell me? - Jesus Christ, Lea. It's not my fault that the man is deluding himself to think that he's in love. I promise you that I haven't hypnotized him or coerced... No, it's just a coincidence. The sad thing is that I let you ruin my life every time I let you in it. How many other lives have you wrecked? Am I the only one on the list? - I haven't done anything wrong. - Yes, you have, but you can't see it because you just rush right in and do whatever takes your fancy. You say what you think and to hell with the rules. Rita the Rebel. Do you want to live in a world where everyone is just like you? Then don't pretend you don't know what's going on. You're being yourself, Rita. That's the problem. Is the magnetic force equally strong all over the magnet? Rita? Perhaps we should start by talking about the Earth's magnetic fields. EXAM - QUIET PLEASE! Rita, it didn't go very well, but you know that. You get an E. Fine. Thank you. Come along, Kim. You're next. The barely acceptable achievement. Is that something to be thankful for? I see that all your final exams are also perfect examples of mediocrity. - Maybe that's what I am. - Maybe you're just lazy. That's also possible. What will all this mediocrity then bring you in the future? Who says I have one? You're the first generation in history to be spoiled for choice, and you choose to show your gratitude by being pessimistic. Perhaps I can't see how lucky I am. You're not stupid. You've just chosen to be. I know that you're an extremely irritating pupil. I also know that you have more potential than any other pupil in this school. But you'll never make the most of it because you'd rather be a brat. The advantages of being an adult aren't apparent when I look at you and the others. Then you should be the kind of adult that children want to be. Good luck with that. It's much harder than it looks. Allan, they called and gave me the job. We're going to continuation school together. It'll be great. I'm not going to continuation school. Yes, you are. I'm moving. No, I don't think so. My parents put the house on the market. My mother has a friend in Copenhagen whose apartment we can rent. I thought we were going to break free. Or that you were. I found a new role-playing group in a park in Copenhagen. Well, look at you. You're on your way out in the world. Out in Copenhagen all on your own. - Not exactly alone. - But you've moved on. I think I might have latched too much on to other people myself. I've been too dependent on Rita. It's probably time to let go. And she does have a really good girlfriend. You mean my mother? I don't think they're friends anymore. - I have to go to class now. - Right... BUTCHER Rita? Hello? Are you here? Could you turn on the lights? Or perhaps I can... Rita! What are you doing? Are you drunk? Not drunk enough. I thought you were skipping school or had a sore throat or something. Here. Allan said that you and Lea had fallen out. Is that what you call it when someone says you're the worst thing that ever happened to them? - Did she say that? - Yes, and a bunch of other things. And all of it was true. But that doesn't mean you can't go to work. Why, Hjørdis? We were just about to find our old selves... and then I screwed it up. She was the only one I had. - Fucking hell, Hjørdis! - "The only one you had"? I'm here! I've been here all the time, Rita. You hit me! Yes. You're such an idiot. I'm not. I was here sleeping and feeling rotten, and you come in and hit me! And you deserved it. You can't lie here and feel sorry for yourself and pretend that you're all alone in the world when it isn't true! I'm here! Right. Hjørdis... I'm sorry. Can you forgive me? I'm not the one who needs to forgive you. - Okay... But Lea won't. - It's not Lea either. Then who is it? Martin? Rita... you have to forgive yourself. Okay... No, I can't. - Yes, you can, Rita. - No. Now listen to me. You can forgive yourself, you got that? You can do it. And afterwards you build up something new. Okay? Okay. Come here. There, there. BJARNE IS A DICK I'm sorry. You might not believe me, but I am. I believe you. People rarely act like assholes deliberately. - Unfortunately, we can't do much about it. - We can. - Hi, girls. - Hi, Rita. Have you been sick? You could say that, but now I'm back. See you. Hi, Liam. Do you remember what we talked about last time? You said something that gave me an idea. Neither one of us feels like moving. We like it here. So come with me. I want to show you something. Liam... - Did you live here? - Yes, until I was 16. And now you want to live here again? - No, I want to turn it into a school. - It won't be a very big school. No, it'll be a so-called progressive free school. I talked to the municipality. You only have to have 11 pupils to start one. So it's an option for those who want to stay in town. Lots probably want to. Welcome to the cafeteria. - Will that be the schoolyard? - Yes, it'll have to be. Come. Maybe you should've bought a bigger place. It's too late now. I already bought this. There probably won't be room for fancy sports grounds. And there'll only be enough room for a couple of classrooms. And then I might be the only teacher. I... What do you think? Yes... This could work out well. ASSHOLE GASOLINE THE SUN IS SHINING RITA IS A WHORE Good morning. Christ, Bjarne. You startled me! This may be a small town, but remember to lock your door. What the hell are you doing here? And where have you been? I had a few errands to run. Right. With other people's money. Yes, exactly. I drove home last night to get my things and I saw something about a progressive free school in the local paper. Yes, an unorthodox one, but that's the plan. There are many ways of learning, and I have confidence in yours. And that's why I thought that you should have this. What is it? - How does this work? You can't. - Can't what? That's other people's money. That money was given to a fund whose purpose is to keep a school in this town. I am head of the fund. You choose to open a school, - and I choose to give you the money. - I choose to thank you, but I can't accept it. You do know that you've been reported to the police. You've been charged with fraud. There must be some misunderstanding. Come. Come with me. Where are we going? We donated the money, so the town could have a school, and we're sticking by that. So use the money wisely. The town needs it. I'll do my best. Thank you so much. Thanks, Bjarne. Anytime. Bjarne has always helped the town, so now it's the town's turn. - Spend it wisely. - I'll do my best. Hjørdis, if you want to... - Hi. - Hi, Hjørdis. Can I ask you a question? Will it take long? I have to pick up Reinulf at his play group. - One minute. - Okay. I'm counting on staying here, and I'm opening a progressive free school at the house I bought. - Yes, I heard. I'm glad. - Right. At first I could only afford to pay one teacher's salary, but with the financial aid I've been given, I can afford to hire another teacher. This is already taking too long. Hjørdis, I'd like to take you with me because you're a good teacher and a good friend. Thanks. So, Hjørdis. Will you come and teach at my school? No. Okay... Okay. That's fine. And I understand... - If you need a principal, I'm in. - What? I know that you're starting the school and are its founder, but I'm better at responsibility. I'd love to be the progressive free school's principal. You're an excellent teacher whom I'd hire at once. Okay... Right then... As the founder of the school I can tell you that you're hired. Okay... As the principal I can tell you that you're hired too. Awesome. - I'll go and pick up Reinulf. - Yes, do. Right. You're strong, Uffe. You're strong and you can put your foot down. Hi there. - Hi there. - Put your foot down. I called out "hi there". Why didn't you answer? - Hjørdis! - Uffe... I'm putting my foot down, Hjørdis. We're not moving. - No... - Quiet. I'm not finished. I'm putting my foot down, and you have to respect me as a man, lover and father. Actually... You can't just make decisions on behalf of all three of us without consulting me. Reinulf has just gotten used to this place and is putting down roots. And I'm putting down roots too. I like my job, my home and no matter what you say, we're not moving. Okay! - That was very loud, Hjørdis. - Yes, very loud. I'm sorry. And I'm sorry about everything else. I know I should be better at listening to you. I can't just call all the shots... here. Here? What do you mean by "here"? What do you mean by "here"? - Hi... - Hi. - Wow. - My goodness. What can I do for you? We heard that you're opening a progressive free school here. We thought it would be best for Knud to stay in town. - So we were wondering... - If our son could be admitted. I couldn't say. - I told you! - You have been awfully hard on her. But you can ask the principal. I think she's free at the moment. - Hi, Niels and Kalinka. - Hi, Hjørdis... - Come into my office. - You got us. Very funny. Welcome. - Hi. - Hey, Hjørdis. - Wow! - Go on through. - Here? - Yes. - Hi. - Hi. I heard that he found a role-playing group in Copenhagen. Yes. I think he was texting with a wizard or an orc, maybe even a girl. - You're moving? - Yes. Of all the things the two of us imagined, this wasn't one of the things I thought would happen. Well, I did promise that I would run you out of town. - And Martin? - He's already there. Take care. You've never been very good at it. Subtitles: Henriette Persson
