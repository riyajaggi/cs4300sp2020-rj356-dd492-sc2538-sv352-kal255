 Yes. That is, if the end to "Well, if it isn't...?" is Hjørdis. What are you having today? I'm thinking of trying the one with fish. Do you know what kind of fish it is? I don't think even the fish knows what kind of fish it is. I'll just have a burger, then. You don't have to come here every day to eat. Well, I don't. You're on the "Employee of the Month" list. Right? And you don't even work here. I brought some dinner. It's from a sustainable farm. Fuck my sustainable ass. Are you okay? You ask me that every day, and yes, today I'm also okay. Aren't you going back to teaching soon? Hjørdis, I don't want another talk about going back to teaching.

 You're smoking. Damn it, Casper-Emil! Give me that. I'll shoot off with Reinulf. Yes. See you, Hjørdis. Bye, Hjørdis. Mum? Jesus... I've washed it three times. It still smells of burned burger joint. Isn't it time you found something else to do? Yes. You're right. I'm going to live out my lifelong dream of becoming a YouTube star. Or you could get yourself a real job. Something you're trained to do. There aren't any. Of course there are. Come and sit down. Here. JOB SEARCH WITH 1 CLICK Not right now, Molly. What are you so afraid of? Right now, I'm afraid I'll never get this smell out of my hair again. JOB SEARCH WITH 1 CLICK 82 JOBS MATCHING YOUR SEARCH: TEACHER 82 JOBS MATCHING YOUR SEARCH: TEACHER We're looking for a dedicated teacher at Bavnegård School We're looking for a dedicated teacher at Bavnegård School ...very well-run school with high ambitions for its students... Did you know that your meat contains less than 30% meat? No. But our strong beer contains 7.2% alcohol. I guess I just think you deserve something better. 50%, maybe. Yes, me too. - I'm talking about meat. - Oh... too bad. I also think there are some kids who deserve you. Yes. But there are some schools that don't agree. You don't know that. I don't exactly come with the best recommendations in the world, do I? Maybe there's a reason for that. Rita? Coming! - See you. - Yes. Tomorrow. - Rita, damn it! - Coming. Good morning. I just had a little nap. A little nap? Your phone rang. Yes. It wasn't important. - How do you know that? - Because it was for me. Rita speaking. Eh, no. There must have been a mistake. You're welcome. You, too. Bye, bye. That was someone from the Bavnegård School. Okay? What did they want? They'd had my application and wanted me to come for a job interview. Cool. The thing is, I haven't applied for a job. It's my old school. - Molly, did you apply on my behalf? - What if I did? - You should call and say it was a mistake. - Or you could go to the interview. No, I'm not going to the interview. And you shouldn't... Molly, you shouldn't write applications on my behalf. - I'm your mum. - Okay. Then imagine, as my mum, what it feels like, seeing the woman who should be my role model, wasting away her life on my couch every day when I get home. Can't we just say I'm not a role model? You could at least try to do something with your life. Yes, but not at my old goddamn school. I had no idea it was your old school. I don't know anything about you from back then. You'd clicked on the job posting yourself, so I thought applying would be a good idea. And now it's done. Do with it what you want. BAVNEGÅRD SCHOOL Democracy is the cornerstone of our society. It's what our civilization is built on. And it's the primary reason why we're so far ahead of communism. Both when it comes to culture and economy. But we cannot take democracy for granted. Democracy is not something we get. It's something we have to fight for. Our democracy was founded on the basis of our constitution, and when was that? No? Stefan. What? - The Constitutional Act. - What about it? When was it passed? In the '60s or something? 1849. It took several years before women and servants gained the right to vote and were allowed to express their opinions. It started in 1849. You should know that. You're only calling on the boys. The girls have had their hands up the whole time. But you don't care. And you're talking about democracy! It makes no sense. Of course, coming to a new place takes some getting used to, - but here we don't behave in that way. - And by "here," you mean the Middle Ages? Maybe you have a better suggestion for how I should run my classes? I'd probably leave the confirmation suit at home. And stop combing my hair with liver paste. Out. SCHOOL HEADMASTER - Hi. - Hi there. Well. You started here yesterday, and you've already been sent out of the classroom. That's got to be a new record. But it doesn't matter. I'm a girl, right? - What is that supposed to mean? - Rostrup only calls on the boys. Rostrup is from another time. - Yes, but he lives in this one. - Not according to himself. My daughter, Lea, is in your new class, by the way. I'm really glad you started here. Welcome. And good luck in there. SCHOOL PRINCIPAL Come in. Well, here we are. Job interview. Right now, we're in the same boat. We've stepped into a shared space which we can only create together. And each of us is obliged to make sure the other one comes through it unscathed. - Exciting, eh? - Yes... Only if you think so. I mean, it's not grounds for dismissal. You don't work here yet, of course. My name is Bjarne Ulrichsen, and I'm the principal here at Bavnegård School. I'm also the chairman of the town fair committee and a member of the committee for cultural affairs, and I'm the local chess champion, to put it en passant. And I have Lundsager's only private swimming pool, which can be an advantage when you want a town of people to like you. And...? Well, my name is Rita Madsen. I've just learned how to make burgers. Also handy for bribing people. - I really liked your application. - Thanks. It's good. - My daughter wrote it. - Okay. But you're here now. And she writes that you're a good teacher. Is that true? I wouldn't have been fired if I was. Self-confidence is the most important "dence" there is. That sounds like something you'd read in a pack of licorice. Well, have you ever seen a pack of licorice that was wrong? We have to believe in ourselves. It's difficult getting teachers for a school like ours. When you went here, there were three classes per year group. Now there are two. In the eighth and ninth grades, there's only one. We're losing students, and therefore also teachers. The local authority wants to close one school. That increases the uncertainty. More people run away. So you'll be closed down? I won't allow that to happen. People trust me in this town. Bjarne is a guy who can fix things. And I'll fix this school. I just need some really good teachers. So I hereby ask you: Rita Madsen, are you a good teacher? Thanks to your management skills and psychological insight, I now trust myself completely again. Well, that's it, then. Perfect. Or we could toss a coin. - You're hired. Tails. - Yeah, I'd say so. Mine was the only application you got, right? - What's that? - Here you go. - Is that for me? - Yes. - How exciting. - A present. What did he say when you said no? - Said no to what? - The job. Because it's much too far away, and you should never move back to where you came from, because that's where everything went wrong. The place you've been trying to escape from inside your head your whole life. You know, where everyone bullied you, right? - No. - No, of course... no. But the fact is, you can't just leave everything behind for an insignificant, temporary school job. I'm not really leaving anything behind. - What about your home? - Well, I'm staying with Molly. - Or your kids? - They've left home. - What about your friends, then? - Yeah, right! What about me? Maybe it's the best thing for you as well. What is? Maybe I've taken up a bit too much space. Am I not your bard anymore, then? It's a new chapter. Yeah, but you're writing the book on your own. I've always done that. - Thanks for the present. - You're welcome. - It's an eagle. - A dashing eagle. BUTCHER BUTCHER BOB FOR RENT CALL 91113975 Right. These were the last boxes. I don't know if I'm starting over or starting from the back... - It'll be great. - Yeah. There's nothing cooler than moving in to a flat above a butcher's. If you're 18. - Yeah, or a meat lover. - Yeah, exactly. You're just scared. FOR RENT CALL 91113975 No, there's nothing to be scared of. BAVNEGÅRD SCHOOL - Are you new? - Yup. It's my first day of school. Aren't you a bit old to have your first day of school? Yes. Hello, everybody. Sit down. My name is Rita. I really want to learn your names, but I'm 45, and I can hardly remember the names of my own kids. From what I've heard you have a history theme at the moment, combining several subjects? Good. Tomorrow, we'll have a visit from an archaeologist who will tell us a bit about the Stone Age. But today, I thought we could talk a bit about the recent past. In that way, I can get to know you a bit better as well. I'd like you to go into groups of, say, four, and talk about what you were like when you were ten years old. What did you imagine the future would be like? What did you want to become? And who have you become? That sort of thing. Then we'll discuss it in plenum afterwards. What do you think? Fine. Great. Let's start, then. Find some groups. No, I'd just like to be on my own. I'd rather not do it. - Hello. - Hi. Don't you have anyone you can team up with? Er, yes. I just don't really feel like it. You don't feel like it? I'm always allowed to sit on my own. Because I'm a highly sensitive person. You're highly sensitive? - It's true. He's a bit special. - Okay. Listen... I'm sorry, but there's no such thing in here. It's a real diagnosis, you know. And in the old days, people said that insanity was rooted in the teeth. I want you to join a group. Okay? - Allan, come over here. - Go and sit with the others. - No. I'm not doing it. - Yes, you are, champ. Come on. Get up. - You can't tell me what to do. - When you're in my class, I can. You can be as sensitive as you want during break. Come on. Don't touch me! Okay. Just keep working. It's fine. We need to talk. Well, it seems like you've already started. Several girls from our class tell me that time and time again, - you choose to only call on the boys. - That's rubbish. But you can tell the girls, including your own daughter, that if they wish to be heard, they have to speak up. They've got their hands up all the time, and you refuse to hear them. If those girls think they deserve to be heard, they'll have to insist. I don't know if you're here as a teacher or as Lea's mother, but you're certainly not doing them any favors by depriving them of the opportunity to speak up for themselves. And if they do that, you send them out of the classroom, right? They learn from that as well. Can I return to my egg sandwich now? Get it off me. Get it off me! - Yuck, not my hair! - Boys! - Come here, girls. - What are we doing? Come on. Get up. - Mum, it's our break time. - Yes. Come, get up. Come and stand here. I want you to say your names out loud and clear, so that everyone in here can hear them. Okay? What are your names? Come on. What's your name? Just tell me your name. What's your name? - Lea. - Louder. My name is Lea. I know you're not used to this, because you've never been called on. And if you want that to change, you'll just have to speak up. Don't be so scared of missing the target or not being perfect. You have to be imperfect. Come on, let's try it again. We'll try again. Yell it out with me now. My name is... Right. Fine. My name is Rita. My name is Rita. You're all a bunch of wimps. Do you have a minute? I'd like to discuss a student with you. - Oh, you've met Allan. - Exactly. I heard there was a bit of trouble in class, but... We've agreed with his parents that he should be protected. That's what highly sensitive kids are like. I don't believe in that diagnosis. I know that some children are more sensitive than others, right? But if we give Allan a diagnosis, then it's a straitjacket. It means he doesn't have to participate in our class activities. So in that sense, I don't believe there are highly sensitive children. I believe there are children who need help in order to interact with others. - I believe so, too. - Yup. It's our job to make sure he makes the most out of his time here. - Exactly. - Yeah. So to me, it's slightly problematic to put him in a cocoon and tell him that it's okay for him to sit on his own. I couldn't agree more. Really, Bjarne? Yes. It just so happens that we have an agreement with his parents. - Parents are children's worst enemies. - A deal is a deal. Bjarne, you asked me at the job interview if I'm a good teacher. And yes, I am a good teacher. As long as I get to do what I know is best for my students. If the parents think that's problematic, you'll just have to tell them who I'm actually here for. Right? I just don't see any reason to fall out with anybody. This is such a lovely town. Everyone likes each other. You think I'm naive. You think I'm an amateur, just because this isn't the big city. But I'm not. I just know my local area. People trust me. They count on me to make things hang together. But I can't do that if people are angry. I have to talk to Allan's parents. And I have to ask you not to get into conflict with them. BUTCHER Are they close? Yes. There are two right opposite each other, a hundred meters away. Let's see if I ever make it there. Okay, what...? It was this way and then left, right? - And the bus stop is on the other side. - Exactly. Want me to come with you? You're welcome to stay another night if you want. I think you're big enough to stand on your own two feet. - Thanks. - I guess I owed you one. - See you, sweetheart. - See you. - Get home safely. - Thanks. - Bye, bye, darling. - Bye, Mum. - Those buses are so noisy. - Just pretend that they're bees. Big, angry bees buzzing around. Then it's not too bad. Rita is moving back to her hometown. Isn't that a bit strange? I don't know. Is it? Something weird happened, right? I was down at the school where she's going to work, completely by coincidence, and then they offered me a job as well. That's weird, isn't it? - What? - Yes, exactly. "What?" That was my thought as well. But then I thought: This is what you've always dreamed of. So maybe we should just give it a go. No, Hjørdis, we have to talk about things like that. You can't make such a decision on behalf of the family without conferring with us. No, but they've got woods and a house and a garden. Yes, and Rita. It's just great. It doesn't have anything to do with that, actually. - What about my job? - You don't like your job. - No, but... - And you're going on paternity leave soon. Yes, but... No. You can't entice me with your naughty Elvish talk now. No... Okay, fine. I'll come with you to look at it. - Will you? - Yes, but it won't be... It's something we decide together. Right, Hjørdis? Don't start jumping up and down. We haven't decided anything yet. - We'll go down and have a look today. - Yes. But we haven't decided anything. If you start digging into the past, you risk finding shit. And that's why we've invited you, Hans. Hans is an archaeologist, specializing in... - Shit. - Shit. Well, to me, shit is not something you "risk" finding. It's something you hope to find. We did a big excavation nearby. There, we found a dunghill from a neolithic settlement. And what we leave behind says a lot about who we are, of course. Doesn't it say more about what comes out of our ass when we're having a shit? Yes, but it's a very honest testimony. It says a lot about what humans ate, for example. And what the flora and fauna were like. Faeces never lie. - That's gross. - Yes, Allan. It is. But it's also very old and important, so we'll just have a look at it. We found many fine specimens in the excavation, and I've brought some for you today. Take a look and see if you can guess which ones are from animals, - and which ones are from humans. - You want us to touch shit? It's old shit, Vanessa. It won't hurt you. - I'm not doing it. - Yes, Allan. We all are. Come on. I'm not doing it. - Allan, it's old shit. - So what? I'm not touching it. Allan... okay. Without making this into a scene from Zappa, just touch this piece of shit like your classmates, so we can get it over with. - No. - It's just a little piece of shit. I said no! Hey! Allan! Stop! Allan? Hey, Allan! - Leave me alone! - Allan, stop... My mum says I have special needs, but you're not listening! - Listen... - Why don't you just ask her? I will. But Galilei maintained that Earth was not the center of the universe. Just a small, insignificant dot in an endless ocean of other insignificances. That theory wasn't popular back then, so they locked him up. But that didn't stop Galilei from thinking it was so. He actually held on to his beliefs right until his death in 1642. When was the prohibition against his theories removed, do you know? Come on. No? No? - In 1758. - Pardon? - In 1758, the Church... - Did I say you could talk? - No... - So why are you sounding off, girl? - I had my hand up. - Well done. That's not a sufficient reason to just shout out your answer. No, but if not, you'll just ignore us. And we won't accept that, you know. You won't? Lots of support, eh? Get out. My god, you're pathetic. Well. You got a bit of support after all. Even if comes from the most awkward of sources. Get out, both of you. The rest of us are here to learn something. - I've never been kicked out before. - I'm sorry to hear that. It's not funny. This is actually your fault. - I'm not the one who spoke up. - No, but you started it. You just move from one school to another. I'm actually planning to make it in this world. What are you planning to become when you prefer not to talk? A mime? If you haven't got anything nice to say, it's better to not say anything. I'm sure that'll help. You're not allowed to smoke in the corridors anymore. And here's my mum. Shit. Tell her I said hi. - Have you both been sent out? - It was Rita's fault. - Did you talk back to Rostrup? - Yes. I'm sure you'll survive. Right? What about Rita? Maybe she just needs a friend. - And you think that should be me? - No, no. I'm just saying it. But maybe it would be quite good for you as well. You're just so embarrassing right now, Mum. Well, it's a good thing we're the only ones here, then. Right, sweetheart? What are you doing? Nothing. Come. Show me where you live. - This is where I live. - Okay. Go and get your mum or dad. I'll wait here. Okay. Hi. - Hi, sweetheart. - You'd better go outside. Yeah. You look all wrong. What's the matter? Eh? What are you doing here? Hi, Lea. - What do you want? - She's the new teacher. The one who thinks you're lying? No. No, no, I... Allan, I don't think you're lying. I think you believe what your mum is telling you. I don't know what you're doing here, or why you're back. But don't start interfering with Allan's needs. Do you know each other? - No. - Yes. We don't, sweetheart. Go in and get some food. I'll be there in a minute. Listen. Allan is highly sensitive, and we've agreed with the school that you'll help him with that. Yeah, but, Lea... Stay out of anything that has to do with my family. - I'm his teacher. - Yes. Just keep it that way. But you and I have nothing to do with each other. Listen, of course Allan should be allowed to do things at his own pace. - We'll work it out. - That's what I thought. But hey... I... I had no idea you were still living here, Lea. Well, I do. Lea... Lea? Listen, if there's anything you want to talk to me about, - I'd really like to... - We have nothing to talk about. You'll stick to the agreements we've made with the school. Understood? - Is that clear? - Yes, of course. Okay. Thank you. It's like a big city, you know. Just on a small scale, and without all the big things that make a big city big. - It makes you want to live here. - Why don't we just do it, then? - Well, it's... - Just you and me and Reinulf... - And Rita! Hi, Rita. - Gosh, hi! Hi. What are you doing here? Well, it's a new chapter, so... I thought I'd show Uffe how nice our new town is. What? "Our new town"? Yes... I've been offered a job at the school. - Hjørdis, are you following me around? - What? No. I mean... I haven't exactly followed you here. Yet. Listen, it... I think you... It was really good to see you. Or it is. But I think you... I think you should just go back home. We think it's a lovely place. Well, it's not. See you. Take care. Maybe she's right. Maybe you should start fending for yourself. - Do you think that's why we're here? - Why else? You've had lunch with her every day for six months. - You think you need her, but you don't. - No. It's Rita who's not doing well. She doesn't say it out loud, but I can tell. - She needs a friend. - No. She needs a Hjørdis. You know what? We'll give it a shot. Subtitles: Henriette Persson
