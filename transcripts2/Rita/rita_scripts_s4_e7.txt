 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES VIKING MARKET - We raised over 500,000. - Bjarne fixes everything. Your parents are pretty cool. They're okay. - My mom took off. - What? It would be nice if Lea were more like you. Martin, I don't think you'd like that. You know what? I'm so glad that the two of you are friends. It's a bedroom. You can use it whenever you like. - Rita, your turn. - Yes.

 Right. It's a sports question. Right up your alley. - Ready? - Yes. Who was the first gymnast to score a perfect ten at the age of 14 at the Olympics in Montreal in 1976? - Come on. - I don't know! - I know. - It's not your turn. - Nadia... - Henrik! - What? - You're helping. - A little help is allowed. - This is a pie-piece question! It's Nadia... Out with it. We don't have all night. It's Nadia... - Don't help her. - I won't.

 I've got my eye on you. Nadia Comaneci. Dad! I had a frog in my throat. It happens. It can! I remember now. Her name is Nadia Comaneci. When? Okay. Yes... yes. Susanne... Mom? FAMILY She's only 65. It's not fair. I'm sure she'll be alright. She'll be alright. Then they wouldn't have asked us to come. My grandmother is my grandmother. And now she's just lying there all pale and can't do a thing. I don't dare. I don't dare. I'll be right beside you. Never leave. I promise. - It's time to go. - We packed. Oh, no! Morning, Bjarne. Hi. What the hell happened here? Did you have a party? - Rita, now listen carefully. - Yes? I... I... Have a hangover. Yes. That's it. Okay. So... did you talk to the municipal council? What? What about? About the fact that we have the money now. Oh, of course. Yes, we're all set. We're all set to go. - Okay. Bjarne fixes everything. - He does. He can do anything. - Did you tell the other teachers? - No, not yet. - I will. We have to celebrate. - We do, Bjarne. - We'll figure something out. - Deal. Yes, there are plenty of ways to make it your own. As the realtors say, "old crap, everything has to go." There's a bit of rising damp, but that can be remedied. I'll check the attic for insulation. - This is the kitchen. - Yes. Christ, I can't stand him these days. I can tell something is wrong. What is it? I don't know. He's probably the same as he always is. It must be me. If you ask Martin, there's no reason to change anything. And you want to run away with the circus. Yes, it would be a good way of fulfilling myself as a 45-year-old. I checked the attic. You'll need about 20,000 for insulation. - But it's a fantastic house. - 20,000? Yes, but it would be a fun project. - Martin, she hasn't bought it yet. - I know, but she probably will. - You don't know that. - No, and neither do you. Rita? Did you talk to your father today? No, it's been weeks. But I can go to Jutland without telling him. He doesn't care. He does care. I talked to him yesterday. - Why? - Because he's your father. - He's not family anymore. - Stop it. Of course he is. He always will be. Actually, he's very upset. He says you won't talk to him. - He's not upset at all. He hates me. - He doesn't hate you. You don't know a damn thing about it. Sorry. I don't want to go home. But you could at least talk to him while we're in Jutland. Should I call him from there? I think it's best if you don't come with us. My mother is dying, Rita. I'm sorry, but... You're always welcome here, but... But? Well... - I'm not family. - You know what I mean, don't you? Rita... Rita! Hey! What's wrong? Come here. Come here... - Aron, use both hands on the jungle gym. - Yeah. Hi, Allan. What's up? I was wondering if you were busy after school tomorrow? No, I don't think so. Why? I was thinking that you could go with me to this place. Ravndal Continuation School. I know it. They have a role-playing line. I thought you wanted to go straight to college. No, I'd like to go to a continuation school first. And it's a good idea. Wouldn't you rather have your parents go with you to see it? No. And don't tell them. We could just meet here after school. I'll tell my parents that I was with some friends. Okay. And don't tell Rita. She'll just tell my parents. - Okay. - See you later. Bye. I told you to use both hands, Aron. - So... I'm off. - Okay. Go home, Bjarne. You've saved our school. You deserve an evening on the sofa. I'll do that. I'm leaving now. - Good. See you. - See you. Just a minute! Surprise! If someone will give Bjarne a beer, we'll toast him and say thank you. Cheers. What's the plan? When will they start work? Yes... I have to tell you something. Oh, right! Speech! Speech, speech! I couldn't... have done it without you. We rallied around. Parents and businesses have proven that we can create a future for ourselves. - Yes! - And the municipality can't overrule that. No fucking way! It'll work out... really well. Really, really well. - Thank you all very much. - Thank you, Bjarne. - Now for some pizza. - Yeah... Way to go, Bjarne. Thanks. Did you arrange this? Yes. Enjoy. - Well done. - Thanks, Svend. You shouldn't have, but thanks, Rita. There's plenty to celebrate. More than this? I'm buying a house. - Here in town? - Yup. I'm signing the papers tonight. Wow. That was quick. Don't you think you should hold your horses? No. This is the only town where I can afford a house on a teacher's salary. So if I'm to be a grown-up and own more than a few shirts, this is the place. But, Rita. Don't forget to have your lawyer submit a proviso. Yes, Mr. Real Estate Magnate. I have to have a word with Hjørdis. Come and have a taste, Bjarne. Here they are. We have four different kinds. Hjørdis? Why are you leaving already? - I have an errand. - Oh, okay. It's just that I saw you talking to Allan. Yeah. It's just that his mother is a bit worried, and he won't talk to me, so I was wondering if he told you what his plans are for next year. - Yes, a little. - And what...? Maybe he wants to tell you himself. Yes, but I'm his class teacher. - Are you asking as his class teacher? - Yes. You do fraternize a lot with his family. Yes... they are my friends. Friends. And nothing more? No. It's not like you get drunk in a bar and start making out with them? What the hell were you doing there? What I was doing? I was getting Allan's parents. Allan called me. He was home alone and was upset. Then I went to the bar where you all were drunk and making out and didn't seem to care how Allan... I don't know what you think you know, but it isn't true. You know what I know? That Allan is having a hard time. That's what I know! - Okay, good. You know what I know? - No. What do you know? That I can distinguish between things. And I can't? No. I'm not sure you can. It's as if you're trying to be Allan's friend. You're not. You're his teacher. In a month's time, he'll graduate and move on to bigger and better things. So do try to be professional. I'm going this way. You're not going anywhere. Listen to me. Professional? I'm trying to help a child. Exactly! He has to learn to stand on his own two feet. - Otherwise he'll end up... - Or he'll end up like me? Is that what you were going to say? Look me in the eye and tell me that that's not what you were going to say. I hope he does end up like me because I'm fantastic. Your words have no effect on my primordial force. - And now you're laughing at me. - I'm sorry. This may come as a surprise to you, but I can get very angry, and right now I'm close to being just a bit angry. - Right. - Okay? Good. No. Shit... What do you want from me? For you to get involved just a little bit. I'm fucking involved! No, you just think what everybody else thinks. You want the easy way out. How would you know? All you want to do is to get away from me and from Allan. That you would stoop so low! Fuck you! And now you're leaving? Don't walk away when I'm talking to you, Lea! Don't go off like that, Lea... Oh... hi. Hi. This is a difficult time. - I understand. - Do you? - Did you want something? - No. See you. I... Say hi from me. See you, Rita. Sweetie? Why are you crying out here? Sorry. It's because crying isn't allowed in the living room, so I came in here to cry. Hjørdis, you're allowed to cry in the living room. Okay. What's the matter? What is it? Where is Reinulf? He's fine. He's asleep. Let's have a good cry, and then you tell me what's wrong. - Right. - What is it? It's Rita. She called me unprofessional. No one has called me that since Rosa, and I wasn't then and I'm not now. I know that. You've never been unprofessional. Then why did she say so? I don't know. Why did Rosa say it back then? Because... It's not important, Uffe. Yes, it is. Why did she say that? - Because... - Because? Rita said she was a spoiled brat and she put her in her place. Okay. - Should I put Rita in her place? - Yes. - I don't dare. - No. But instead perhaps you should let her go. I can't. No. She's my friend. I know. I understand. Come here. - Hjørdis. - Yes. RAVNDAL CONTINUATION SCHOOL This is a typical room for four that you would be in. Are all the rooms for four? It's what our pupils miss the most when they leave. Sharing a room with their friends. But we do have rooms for two. - Are you an only child? - Yes. I'm highly... - Highly what? - Nothing. Don't worry. Here at Ravndal you can always find someone to hang out with. And if you need some alone time during the day, that's also possible. You can go and see the common room without us breathing down your neck. It's down there on the left. How about you? What are your plans for next year? Mine? I need someone to teach Danish, history and social studies. What do you say? I mostly teach the youngest pupils. I'm best at the little ones. And the big ones obviously. Well, yeah... I teach at a school where I have a good friend, but it sounds tempting. - Think about it. - Right. Come in. Yes, I skipped school the last two days. Get over it. I don't notice whether you're here or not. Why are you here anyway? You don't like children. - Who says I don't? - You sure act like you don't. If you mean that I don't treat pupils with kid gloves like certain other teachers, you're right. And what good would it do? You look just as miserable as always even though Susanne mollycoddles you. You know nothing about it. The success of my pupils reflects on me, and that makes me a good teacher. Susanne thinks she's a good teacher, but she tends to make promises she can't keep. What did she promise you? Nothing. You know nothing about me. So it's not about you having a room in their house? I do know what's going on. I know more about you than you think, but it's not a teacher's job to save pupils from their hopeless parents. The pupils will have to manage that on their own. But I can't. What do you want me to do? Be strong. If you're not wanted, leave. Leave them before they leave you. Is that your motto? You could say so. One shouldn't stay where one isn't wanted. It's a waste of energy. And on that note... BUTCHER Yes? Hi. Hasn't Lea come home yet? Yes. Hours ago. Okay. What... I was wondering if I could come in. - Sure. - Thanks. - Beer? - Please. - Are you moving? - Yes. I signed the papers yesterday. I'm moving in two weeks. Here. - Thanks. - Sit. Martin, I'm not the kind of person who people confide in about things. No... Okay... She'll get over it. This has never happened before. We never argue. Isn't that what you do in a relationship? - What if she wants a divorce? - I doubt it. - She's more and more irritable. - Or you're more and more irritating. I'm the same person I've always been. Okay, but maybe she needs a change. You can't hold that against her. I thought you liked me. Yes, I do, but that doesn't mean that she couldn't use a change. You'll have to figure out if you want to change or divorce. Did she say she wants a divorce? Hell, no. It's what you just said. She hasn't said anything. Did you mean that? Yes, I... What part of it? That you like me. Yes, Martin. I do. Should I comb your hair and put a bow in it, so you believe me? No, it's just that I'm glad. I like you a lot too. I really like you. Okay... You and I see the world in the exact same way. Obviously not. I'm sorry. It's just that... I'm an idiot, but everything you do is just fantas... Stop it, Martin! You're married to Lea. Yes, but I think she wants a divorce. She can't stand me anymore. I'm serious. If you want me, I'll leave her. I'll answer the phone and then you'll take off. Yes, Bjarne? I'm so upset, Rita. Does everyone have to feel things so keenly today? Right, Bjarne. What's up? I cut myself. I can't take anymore. Don't you see? - I'm coming. - Measurements have been taken! What are you talking about? The measurements have been taken. Thanks for everything. Bjarne... Are you at school? - Thank you. - Bjarne... Bjarne? Shit! Good God! For fuck's sake, Bjarne! I thought you had done something stupid. - What happened to your hand? - I fucking cut myself. What the hell...? They're closing the school, Rita. Do you hear? - They are turning it into senior housing. - What are you saying? They sold the whole lot. And it's my responsibility. - Are they going to sell it anyway? - Yes. All the money, all those people. Everything they've done. They trusted me, Rita. Bjarne, hey. I'm sure they'll understand. - I don't think so. - What the hell are they thinking? Do I have to tell them? What? Do you have to tell them? Bjarne, now get a grip. Soon, a bunch of teachers won't have a job, so it's a really good idea to tell them before that happens. Right. What... what should I say? I can't do it. Bjarne, hey... Bjarne... Hey. Listen. Get your things and we'll go home. And tomorrow you call a teachers' meeting and say, "I thought I could save the school, but I couldn't." You aren't the world's savior. You have to accept that. Come. Come along... Perhaps I should just write a letter. To the teachers and then... No. Come with me. I have to get my phone. I'll get it. You wait here. Where the hell did you put it? Bjarne, it's not here. Bjarne? You're back. Jesus Christ! - Sorry. - It's okay. I was just... Susanne's mother died last Saturday. The funeral was today. She's staying in northern Jutland for a few days, but she thought Lea should get back to school. Okay. Where are you going? To bed if that's okay. It's fine. - I think... - What? It's fine for you to stay as long as Susanne isn't here, but afterwards... She needs a break. You know? So that whole bit about me being part of the family was just a lie? - No, not at all. - It's fine. I don't want to be here anyway. Rita, stop that nonsense. You know I didn't mean it that way. Rita... Rita, for Christ's sake. You don't have to skulk off in the middle of the night. When you're not welcome, you might as well clear out. Knock it off, Rita. You know that I don't mind, and Lea would love it, - it's just... - Susanne. Yes. - Give me that. - You're only 15. - I'm 16. - So what... You're too much. I thought she was different. Susanne? She doesn't really mean it. Actually, she just wants to help. She wants to be the type that helps. That's a very grown-up thing to say. Grown-ups are the ones who are childish. They lie. They say that they'll stay, but then they leave. They say you can stay, but they mean leave and that everything is fine, but nothing is. Isn't that childish? Yes. Goodnight. - Henrik? - Yes? Will you promise me that you won't lie to me? Yes, of course. Will I be allowed to move back in? No, I don't think so. Is Susanne tired of me? Are you tired of Susanne? I don't know. Yes, sometimes, but it's like that for everyone. Do you want to have sex with me? You promised to be honest. Do you want to have sex with me? Let me rephrase that. Say no if you don't want to have sex with me. Rita... Rita... Hey, hey... Rita... Hey, hey. Rita, relax. Rita, don't... Rita... Subtitles: Henriette Persson
