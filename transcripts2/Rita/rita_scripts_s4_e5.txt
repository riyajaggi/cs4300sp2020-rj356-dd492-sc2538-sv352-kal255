 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES - Are you often home alone? - Why do you ask? It's important for you to have an adult to talk to. Things are really weird at home. My mom took off. What? My dad says we shouldn't count on her coming back. You can stay here for as long as you like. Rita, we have to stick together for this school to survive. You would never have become the person you are without this town. I had no idea Lea had a friend called Rita. Do you have any other secrets? - Cheers. - There aren't any stories.

 You led the way in skinny dipping at night. I have three. Molly, Jeppe and Ricco. Ricco is married to a woman we're not too fond of. She's probably nice and has a kid. I can't get over the fact that you're a grandmother. Yes, theoretically I am. I had them when I was really young. - It was wise of you to wait. - Yes... But if we'd had him when we were young, he would have moved away from home by now. Well, it won't be long before you do. Don't you think so, Allan? Allan, put your phone away while we're at the table. You're excused. Lie down for half an hour before you start doing something else. And you're welcome. - Thanks for dinner. - You're welcome. I love the boy to death, but sometimes he's such a brat.

 But there isn't much we can do. If we put too much pressure on him, he snaps. Yes, he's highly sensitive. A highly sensitive brat. Let's save that for another day. Rita doesn't believe in being highly sensitive. I do believe it, but once children get that label, - it becomes an excuse for everything. - I'll drink to that. Cheers. And this is where I make coffee, so you two can agree on how to raise... Yes, do. Meanwhile Martin and I will get a handle on this. It's true, though. When he was younger, he was afraid of everything. He was afraid of being home alone when it was dark, - afraid of loud noises and strangers... - But he's gotten better. But he still comes with us every time we go out. No! Really? It's become a habit. Our friends are used to it and so is Allan. Okay. Tomorrow you'll come over to my place and I'll make something... We can drink, and Allan stays home. Okay? I'd like that. Can't we try it? YOU AND I We're outside at least two hours a day. We go for a little walk down to the lake and have lunch. - The lake? - Yes. Thank goodness I'm not an overprotective mother - who won't let go of her children. - I keep an eye on them. - Right. - Hi, Reinulf. Do all the children use the swings? Yes. They quickly learn to hold on. Hi there. - Is that it then? - Yeah. - Wave to Mommy. Bye-bye. - Bye. Look what we have here in the sandbox. There you go. Good morning. Excuse me. I know I should have brought Sharebear back yesterday. - You have 1B now, don't you? - Yes. It was Cecilie's turn to bring Sharebear home for the weekend, and I've been hard pressed to finish the last pages. I was up till 3 last night. Wow! You've been to Tivoli Gardens, on a canal tour excursion... Yes, we went to Copenhagen. Could you tell me when it's Cecilie's turn to bring home Sharebear again? It's just so we can make plans. I'm afraid I don't know. I'm their substitute teacher for a few weeks. Gustav's mother did that. She's the national scrapbook champion. The what? The scrapbook champion. Oh. I have a class now. I'll take that. Thanks. - Bye now. - Bye. Two, four... Are you listening? Two, four, six, eight, ten, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20. Boom. That's all I have to say about the two-times table. Do you know whose turn it is to bring home this overstimulated stuffed animal today? - Lukas. - Lukas... Right. Here you go. Alright then. Here, Lukas. Have fun. Pack your school bags. Have a nice weekend. What is it, Lukas? Don't you feel up to taking him home? I must say that Sharebear has had a lot of fun the past few weeks. If I were him, I wouldn't mind chilling out this weekend. It doesn't have to be an exciting weekend. You can do it. - Okay. - Good. - Coming? - In a minute. Are you absolutely certain that she hasn't reported any playground accidents? Okay. Yes. Bye. - Hi. - Hi. Don't you want to be outside with everyone else? No, I can't fit in anyway. You can learn to. How do you feel about role playing? A new group has just started playing here. Isn't it just for nerds? Yes. My husband just established the group. Here. I'll give you my number, so you can call me if you like. How do you list your name on this phone? - Like that. - Great. - Bye. - Bye. That looks amazing on you. Do you want to put some on? Are Mark's parents home? I doubt he'd be having a party if they were. So, are you ready to party? Mom, knock first. Look what I have. Two beers each. Promise me you won't drink more than that. Do you promise? Honestly, Mom. Everyone else gets to drink at least five beers. At least! That may be, but they don't live here. I want you home by 1am. I'm driving over to your grandmother's and staying till the day after tomorrow. - So if something happens... - Nothing is going to happen. I'm just saying that if something happens at the party, you should borrow a phone and call your father. He'll be home in a couple of hours. Good. Enjoy the party. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, dear. Two beers? Two beers? That's so typical of her. Don't you think we can find some more somewhere? Just take a little bit. They won't notice. Should we taste? You and I You and I It's going to be you and I You and I It's going to be you and I What are you two doing? Was this your idea, Rita? No, it was mine. Rita didn't want to do it. Don't tell Mom. Give me that. Fucking hell! Jesus Christ, Lea! Here. Go and buy some proper booze. That cocktail you made will make you sick. Believe me. - Thanks, Dad! - Alright. And speaking of things we shouldn't tell Mom... - Okay. - Now get out of here. Thanks! This Sharebear business has gotten out of hand. It's Sharebear! Have you seen the scrapbook? It's all about outdoing the other parents. No, it's the pupils' job to write what he's been doing. I don't think any of the pupils have touched that book in a long time. I have that class too. None of the parents like having to take that stuffed animal home. You're both missing the point of a sharebear. Enlighten us, Niels. Sharebear gets the parents involved. True. But is it the right kind of involvement? Sharebear is a good way for the pupils to talk about their family. It's not Sharebear's fault that the parents have taken it too far. Yes, it is Sharebear's fault. Take a look at this. That pleasure-seeking shit has been to Tivoli Gardens three times, to LEGOLAND four times and on six package holidays. Oh, look. That's a good picture. And now he's riding on a tractor. Is that Turkey? And a lot of cotton candy. I hope they brushed his teeth. That stuffed animal has had more fun in the past seven months - than I've had my whole life. - The children are fond of Sharebear. Not all of them. Bjarne, something sick is going on with a teddy bear at this school. - What are you doing? - Shut the door. The poker club comes over on the first Friday of every month. In a little town, you have to think outside the box. Want one? It's good to know that we can open a casino if they close the school. Yeah. Let's see how much I can fleece them for. - Maybe enough to go fully digital. - Maybe. If my bluff works. Just a minute! Oh, it's you. Come on in. This is Rita. And this is the poker club. - Hi. - Elsebeth, a local contractor who is to blame for most of downtown. Jonas has the lumber yard down by the main road. You might know Eigil from the local co-op. He also runs the gas station down by the main road. We have room for another player if you like. No thanks. I have a teddy bear crisis I have to handle. Hi, Lukas. You forgot something. Darn! It doesn't have to be fancy. Take him out in the back yard. It's just a way of getting the children to know each other's families. Don't you want him for the weekend, sweetie? I'm leaving tomorrow and I'll be gone for six weeks. - Where are you going? - Afghanistan. I'm a military doctor. - For six whole weeks? - Yes, six whole weeks. But Lukas and I talk a lot about it. Don't we, Lukas? Lukas knows that it's not a dangerous place to be. I don't enter the war zones. Lukas, how about if I take him home for the weekend? Then he'll have a quiet weekend on my sofa, and you can have him back when your mother comes home. Deal? Isn't that a good idea? Go ahead and go to your room. Thank you so much. Some of the parents don't appreciate the teddy bear, but no one dares say so. - Is every deployment for six weeks? - Yes, anything shorter isn't worthwhile. Lukas must find it difficult to be without you. Yes, but he has his father and grandparents. You could put it off for a few years until he's older. This isn't a hobby, it's my job. And six weeks fly by. Not when you're seven and miss your mom. Please don't make me feel more guilty than I already do, thank you very much. And no matter what, I have a job to do. Right you are. - What are you going to do afterwards? - After the party? No, after 9th grade. - I don't know. Continuation school. - Continuation school is for losers. - Okay. - No, we'll go to college and major in science. Or math. And afterwards, I'm going to be an architectural engineer. We'll live together. After high school, we'll have an apartment in Paris and live on French bread and love. Or we could go to Nepal. Or the US. I'll drink to that. I just want to get away from this dump. And you will. Yes, in 100 years. I'll never find a boyfriend here. - Maybe we should be lovers. - You and me? Yes. Then we can forget all those stupid boys. We can grow old together and get wrinkles. Deal. It doesn't feel quite the same. No, but that's because we didn't use our tongues. What are you writing, dear? Allan wants to know when we're coming home. Oh, sorry! - Lea, how about putting the phone down? - Right. - Drink this instead. - I'm sending the text. - Thank you. - He'll be fine. I know. - Cheers. And welcome to my humble abode. - Thanks. - Okay! - Down the hatch! No one said you have to drink it in one go. - I thought that was why we're here. - That's the Lea I remember. Give me another or I'll keep checking my phone all night. With pleasure. I just need to see what he wrote. Okay! Fine. - He'll have to learn sometime. - Yes, some of us think so. I know that if it were up to you, he'd be out in the woods with a Swiss army knife and a compass. It worked for Dr. Livingstone. Who died of malaria and the runs. Give him some anti-diarrheal product and he'll be fine. Fine. How are your kids? I think all of them will agree that I haven't been the best mother in the world. When it comes down to it, we don't know anything. Exactly. Let's drink to that. We'll empty what we have here and hit the bars. Seriously? I don't recall seeing any of you at the hearing. My kids are in high school. I was at a meeting about the new nursing home. How did it go? This can't go any further. I got the municipality's consultant drunk. He said that he thinks the school should be closed. Shit. Why? The municipality has six schools. Five of them are fully digital. We aren't, so that's their excuse. - People will move away. - And it will affect business. - How much will it cost? - What difference does it make? - We have to cut costs on every level. - But how much? Half a million. Maybe more. Is it tax deductible if it's charity? - I'll have to check that out. - Yes, do. I see that. What a pity. Sorry about that. Leave me alone. - Lea... - Leave me alone. You can't lie here. Come on now, Lea. Lea? Oh, poor baby. She ate something that didn't agree with her. Yes. - We're going to a party. - And you will, sweetheart. Let me... Go away! I hate you! Hey, hey, Lea. You were the one who gave us money for booze. I think it's best that we keep this to ourselves. We're going to a party! What's that? It's not mine. Okay, it is mine, but you can't smoke... Rita, knock it off. Don't be childish. I'll tell Susanne what you do when you're alone. She knows perfectly well what I do when I'm alone. You watch 3D films. Holy moly. Don't you have anything from after 1975? Because nothing good was written after '75. No, let me. Move. Night-black... - Old man's music. - Oh, shut up. I'm not even 40 yet. Yes, you are. Yes... I am. - You know what? - What? I'm so pleased that the two of you are friends. She's a bit too sensible and afraid of doing something wrong. It's okay to make mistakes once in a while. That's how you can tell that you're alive. You and I It has to be you and I You and I It has to be you and I - What are you doing? - I'm just texting where we are. Come on, let's dance. - Martin, where did you two meet? - On a construction site. Blah, blah, blah... That sounds sexy. Tell me more. It was Lea's first work experience and she had to meet the workmen. Guess who she met first. So it's been happily ever after since then? Yes. 26 years. Twenty six years... in this town. - I never forced you to live here. - No, so why didn't we go away? We went to Vietnam last year. What? You know what I mean. But we're adults now. - Cheers, you guys. - Cheers. And you're an adult too and have three children. You haven't held back. And yet the best thing in the world is still watching TV. That's easy to say when you've tried everything. I had sex in the woods one time. I was lying on a pine cone. I'm glad you're back. You'll brighten things up. Hey... Hi, this is Lea. Leave a message. If it's about work, please call the company. Have a nice day. Hi, this is Lea. Leave a message. If it's about work, please call the company. Have a nice day. Hjørdis speaking... What? Hjørdis speaking. Hi, Allan. How are you? I see. Okay. And they haven't come home yet? You can go over there and... Yes, I guess it is dark out. I'll go and get them. Allan, I'll call Rita and tell her to send your parents home. They'll be right there. Bye. - No... - What is it? I'll be right back. I have to get Allan's parents. But we were having such a nice time, sweetie. I am so drunk. I've seen you in worse shape, Lea. What is the wildest thing you've ever done? Hell if I know. - Have you killed anyone? - Yes. Lots. How many have you slept with? - This year? - Oh, stop it! - You have a good life. - How the hell would you know? I do, but you know nothing about it. He's hot, isn't he? Would you sleep with him if he wasn't my husband? If you're asking me if I approve, then yes. - Martin! - No. - Martin! - What? Rita would sleep with you if you weren't with me. Cheers, Martin. Your wife is drunk. - Would you sleep with her? - I'm a man for fuck's sake. I'd have sex with a lump of clay if no one was watching. Don't take that personally, Rita. I don't judge people by their sexuality. I take that as a yes. But I won't let you... because she's mine. I just wanted to see how he would react. How did he react? I'm going to have sex tonight. Men are so easy. Did you think about me? Yes. I think that those intense friendships... that teenage girls have... is how they practice before having a relationship. If you learn from the very start that relationships hurt, do you think you can ever learn how to do it properly? Don't you think that... this means that now you've come back... that... we should try again for real... and that we... shouldn't hold back? Yes. I think so. Rita? When you move away... Who says I'm moving away? You will. Then you have to bring me. Don't leave me in this shithole. If you don't take me with you, I'll never leave this place. Do you promise? I promise. I'm going to buy a road and a house. - You're awfully irritating right now. - I'm just good at this. Did you give role playing any thought? It's like a huge board game, but with costumes. But don't they run around in the woods? That's the best part. You're out in nature. Even when it's dark out? Yes, but when you're wearing a costume, it might look silly, but it feels good because you're a character and you dare do things you didn't dare before. At some point you have to go out into the world without your parents. Yes, it might feel like a dangerous place and a big scary world where everything can go wrong, but at some point you have to get on the swing. Sorry? What swing? I'm off. See you tomorrow. Hi, Allan. Are you still up? - I was just playing Settlers. - By yourself? Yes. Are you drunk? - No. - Yes. Mum, I'm 15. You're spoiled rotten. Hi. Hi. Where is Lukas? He's out buying an ice cream with his dad. We already said goodbye. He's coming along to pick me up at the airport when I come home. Okay. I'll look after him while you're gone. Was there something else? Yes. I just wanted to apologize. Your job and what kind of mother you are is none of my business, but I wanted to ask you a favor. Would you mind bringing him? It would be good for the other parents to see Sharebear experiencing something more meaningful than Tivoli and LEGOLAND. And it might be nice for Lukas to know that someone is looking out for you while you're away. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Safe journey. - Thanks. Good morning. - Hi, Rita. - Morning, Isabella. - How did it go yesterday? - Fine. Good morning, Rita. It's no longer a secret. - What's that? - Don't you remember that I had an idea? It's no longer a secret. We'll use crowd funding. The whole town, that is the businesses, want to keep the school open because if it closes, the town will die. I told them that the school will close if we don't go fully digital. You don't know that for sure. No, but alternative facts are all the rage. We'll make it into an event. We'll arrange competitions and get the parents and the whole town involved. - Okay. I'm in. - Okay. - How much money do we need? - About half a million. Christ, Bjarne. There's no way we can do that. - Bjarne has a handle on this. - Does he? If you say so. I do. - My cat had kittens. - Aw. Did it? How lovely. Hi, Lukas. Are you upset? She'll be fine. Don't you worry. Do you think the rest of the class thinks it's weird that my mom is gone all the time? Did you tell them what she does? Come along. Let's go to the classroom. Hey, kids! Go and take your seat. Take your seats. Now listen. I brought Sharebear home for the weekend. - It was Lukas's turn. - Exactly, Cecilie. But I wanted to get to know Sharebear better, so asked Lukas if I could bring him home. - What did you do? - We talked about this and that. Sharebear was a bit tired of his life of luxury. Do any of you know what Lukas's mother's job is? - No. - Okay. Come here. Let me show you. Sharebear needed to get away, so for the next six weeks he'll be in Afghanistan with Lukas's mom. She sent us some pictures, so you can see how Sharebear is doing and what he's doing. - Wow. - She's cool. Can anyone guess what her job is? - She's a doctor. - Exactly. - Is that a hospital? - Yes, it's a field hospital. She's taking good care of Sharebear, isn't she? You bet. They're taking care of each other. Cool mom. Subtitles: Henriette Persson
