 It's done, I took the case. Zaytsev, Shadow's associate and his ABW contact. He was hiding in Odessa for several months before we got to him. The hotel he died in and the one Gauza Jr went to had the same owner. Vitaly Barkov. A year ago, he had a stroke and his wife Tatiana runs his estate now. It was her I saw with Gauza Jr and the smugglers in Ukraine. Barkova is an immigrant herself, her family was relocated to Kurdistan. It's rumoured she started as a dancer in Barkov's clubs. Old Gauza worked for her, now Junior is doing the same. Although Junior claims they weren't in touch.

 His old man disowned him. That phone you mentioned... it wasn't on Markowski or in his car. They must've taken it. Maybe Markowski found something in it? Maybe that's why he called you? I don't know, why don't we fucking ask him? Do your thing. I'm looking for the fuckers who killed him. Look, I have losses as well. Next delivery is going to be on time. It's a promise. Of course I have a plan B. Not over the phone. Do they know where they are? Why did you bring them here? Take them to the woods. What? Get rid of them? Why get your hands dirty? It's minus 20.

 The boss said "no" to wasting good cargo. I'm your boss now. Bring me the men from Poland. Get it? THE PACK I assure you that Polish and Ukrainian agencies are fully cooperating in searching for the ones responsible for this crime. And the nationalistic motive? Various motives are possible, so the case has been assigned to someone familiar with the region and the Border Guard. Once again: Poles and Ukrainians are and will be friends, regardless of single incidents. - She's Ukrainian? - We're not sure. It could also be Chechnya, Azerbaijan. She's definitely Muslim. I'm not religious. You heard Commander Markowski was killed. Yes. The girl was there, she must've seen something. - You've got psychologists. - She won't trust anyone. She didn't even let doctors examine her. Listen... I know you've got bad memories, but the people were bad, not the place. And now I'll meet the good ones? Did you know Markowski was Rebrow's friend? If you do it, I know you'll help him. Come on! One has to stay up there! - How many? - Two. Not later than yesterday. The shoe marks fit, it's those two from the bunker. Crossing into Ukraine through the San River was too much. - Were they at the farm too? - Yup. Same tracks, at the chicken coop and the house. They ran with the others, then split. They'll wait for help to cross. Tell Switalski to stakeout pharmacies. Where are you off to? Fuck, Rebrow... Report all you know. You're with us or you're gone. Markowski discovered something, but he didn't call you guys. And then they killed him. What the fuck are you suggesting? - Hi. - Hi. - Did you handle it? - I'm collecting materials. Chojecki gave me his files, the Border Guard IA aren't so eager. Should I lean on someone? No, I'll manage. I gave you this case to calm things down. There's a conference on trans-border crime this week, half of Europe will be in Przemysl, I don't need any lynch mobs. OK, I'll deal with it. - Oh, hello! - Hello. - Nice to see you. May I? - No, I'm good. - Is Karmiov at the centre? - As you wished. OK. 4 officers outside her room and the building, 24/7. And find me another hotel. - Like we had tons of free time? - Excuse me? First my men drive your witness around, and now the hotel? Drive around? Karimov will get more out of the kid than your shrink would in a week. Because she had a daughter? If the secret police hadn't killed her in Ukraine, she'd be the same age? I thought you had no time. - Zieba told me. - Zieba. I've got plums for your old lady. - How much? - 2 kg. Leave them at Uncle's. Hey, fucker, you've got a run after tomorrow. - Bullshit, the stores are closed. - Going for a trip. Is this some fucking joke? She always sent her guys. The Wife says a Pole will be less suspicious. Because of the green guy? She's pissed the Ruski fucked up and she has to clean up. - We do. - Right. Get your ass ready. All stuff from the Commander's office has been taken to HQ. But you can bring those materials back. I can. But I doubt you'd find anything useful there. - How would you know that? - Experience. Humour me, then. As you wish. I see it as a waste of time. Besides, you've already scooped a piece of the cake. - Find anything interesting? - Nothing you'd find useful. But maybe your experience could help me with this. Does it ring any bells? Nothing? - Do you have a lead? - Nope. If I find something, I'll give you a call. Yes? The Commander says you've got a new hotel, in Olchowiec. Thank you. Hello? - Let me see. - It's this and... we found tracks. By Markowski and on Gauza's property. You think they were hitmen? They'll try to get them back, one is wounded. "Green guy", that's Markowski. You got the wire on Smolinski... And the other guy? - Wisniak. - Where is he now? Hasn't shown up in Poland since the brawl with Gauza. - Learning from his mistakes. - Aren't we all. Barkova is "The Wife", and "the trip"? I'll track Wisniak down. Getting those motherfuckers will give us what we want. Lean on Gauza. They ran out of French fries and ice cream, but... I could get you something at the store. Do you understand me? Do you speak Russian? OK, as you wish. It's your first time? Don't be embarrassed. It's perfectly normal. I'll take care of it. Just don't push me away, OK? I'll be right back. We restock, and back to the mountains. Out in the yard in 15. - That's it for today. - We can keep searching. You've had a 16-hour shift. I'll see you tomorrow at the briefing. Go home. You want to make yourself useful? I need to put a tail on someone. - Just keep it quiet. - Is this about Markowski? Don't lose the guy. And report only to me. - How was the trip? - OK. It's quite a drive from Rzeszow. You haven't visited often. My father? No. I told the other prosecutor. I read the files. You testified you were last here almost a year ago, but I hear you were seen in Lesko on the night of your father's death. - I was passing by, visiting a friend. - What's the friend's name? Marek Piasecki. He's got a car shop in Czarna. Mr. Piasecki can confirm this? Great. Do you recognize this woman? No. And what were you doing in Ukraine on the 23rd? - I want a lawyer. - Why? What have you done? You hid the fact you were 10 minutes from home on the night of the murder. You say you don't know the suspects, but you were seen with them. What does it look like? I needed cash, I got debts. I thought the fucker would be a father for once. He didn't help you. Smolinski called me a week later. I knew him from school. He works in a hotel, near big dough, he made some promises. Like what? A meeting with the owner. But shit came out of it. Am I suspected of something? No. You're free to go. Where's Switalski? - Sweating at the court. - What case? His own. Getting divorced. Sorry to interrupt, but I let Gauza go, and I want him under surveillance. I'll get it done. Aga crapped out? Rebrow took her. He still does what he wants. Didn't give a shit about Markowski. A lot of people got offed around him, right? Sema... cut the bullshit. 00 to all units. A report from tourists near Berezka. It could be our fugitives. 013 to 00. We're in 19. - We'll take it. - Copy that. Let's go. He sensed something. What the...? Come on, he caught a scent. Stay. Go! - Stay cool! - Border Guard! - Against the wall! - Hands up! - Easy! - Osama, what've you got? Come... Looks like swag from Gauzas'. Fucking Pirates of the Caribbean. Get them up! This one's wounded. Show me your hand! Easy... Stop! Hold it! Hands up. Hands up! Stay down! Easy! Stop! Stop or I'll shoot! Fuck... Fuck. 00 to 018, send an ambulance 500 m south from 27. Open your eyes. Look at me! Talk to me! Fuck... The guy was wounded, like Markowski's killer. And the second one? Did you ID them, were they armed? I'm on it, I'll call you as soon as... - We need a statement by tonight... - We won't have a report by... Ukrainian officials will be at the Przemysl conference. I need a clear situation. Papers prove they all worked at Gauza's, plus they had swag from the house. - Which one got shot? - His passport wasn't in the safe. - Did his shoes match the tracks? - We don't know, it was a partial. Fucking find out! If you killed one of the killers, the confession of the other is crucial. I know. Rebrow is trying to squeeze something out of the other guy. - And this? - No. And your permits? They were issued for bogus companies. Did you know that? No. They promised it would be legit. The prosecutor doesn't give a shit about who promised you what. - You had stuff from Gauza's place! - I just wanted my passport. - Others stole. - It's always fucking others, right? Your friend who ran in the tunnel, he was wounded. Why? Artyom cut himself with a grinder. They had him doing woodwork. - You ran away all together? - Yes. - You didn't lose anyone? - No. Do you know this place? No. What's with Artyom? I heard a shot. - Why did you run? - Can I have some water? Innocent people call for help. They don't steal, don't fucking run. Then arrest me! Gauza said he'd let us go once we worked off travel and board expenses. Fucking bullshit. He just added new debts every day. The was an audit once. The police came, the Border Guard... And what? Whom were we supposed to call? What? Smolinski's waiting for someone by the Solina. Stay put, I'll be right there. - Well? - It's not them. - And the girl? You had someone for her. - I'm working on it. How long? Do I tell you how to keep your guys from shooting witnesses? She's the only one who saw them! Speed it up. - Is it urgent? - I hear what's happening. - Do you want me to come down? - And your skiing with your daughter? - I can call it off. - Don't do that. - You'd disappoint her, she'd blame me. - There's no chance you'd join us? No. I got to go. Bye. - What? You got your cars fucked up? - Fuck! - Cool it! You like it hard? - Hands on your head! Hands on your head! - She broke into my car! - On your head! Tough luck, then. She's a Guard. Cuff him. Fuck... - You're gonna pay for that break-in... - I'll kick your ass in jail, then. You were checking a damaged car, get it? - Get it?! - Yes. I'm sorry. Go home. Fuck! Now talk. Where are they? Who? Fucking Santa! The Commander's killers. Man, how the fuck would I know that? Sorry... still nothing. Fuck! Chaos after the Bieszczady farm massacre continues. The motive remains unknown. Questions arise about the functioning of law enforcement in the region. The Border Guard HQ refuses to comment on the Ukrainian's death. Yeah, make a saint of him. If they want rights, they should stay home. We have apprehended a group, all are treated according to the law. - I could've run after you. - Don't fucking give me that. Drink up and go home. No talking to anyone or hanging out until further notice. No discussion. Go with him. There's no time. She has to start talking. It's not like that. If I push her, she won't say anything. Thanks to you she agreed to an examination. Try. Do you know why they didn't hurt her? Because girls like that are worth more. For virgins, they pay 3000, 4000 euros. There are more girls like her out there. It's up to us what happens to them. Tell her that. - Did she say anything? - She let the doc examine her. - OK, I'll talk to her myself. - No, you can't interrogate her. I don't want to wait for someone else to catch them. I put Wisniak in jail. That lead is burned. What's she doing here? A good job. Thanks to her the kid started talking. They killed the Commander, a woman and a child, - and you bring her, with her traumas? - Because of them. Put your own ass on the line, not other people's. I came here, found a job. - And Halid? - He's with his father. - Did he grow tall? - A bit. I'll be here for a few more days. Maybe I'll be able to help. No, no... Listen... you should leave. I don't know what Dobosz told you, but those are very dangerous people. - Stay away from all this. - I know about Markowski. How've you been? It doesn't matter. Be careful, OK? Leave. You know him? I do. He once saved mine and my son's life. You've got a son? Where is he now? Home, waiting for me. Missing me. He once had a situation like yours. Do you miss anyone? My brother. What's his name? - Ali. - And yours? - Selima. - A beautiful name. Selima, where's your brother? I don't know. I want to pray for him, but I can't, on the impure days. You can. You can pray whenever you like. If you want, we could pray for him together. Have a seat. That shit was bound to blow up. Poland is hospitable... as long as guests do as they're told. - Do you know whose son he is? - No. - Staszek's. - Semeniuk's? You don't fucking say. That's life for you... The old man dies in the guardhouse bombing, now the kid kills a man. They'll fucking fire him, right? Wait... - I'll go get some stronger stuff. - Right. Right is when the beaver's tight. There is no stronger stuff! - I'm off. - Where to? You're not driving, are you? I'll walk. You put my guy in jail. He took the blame for the retorts, met the right people, and now you're fucking up a 6-year operation, get it? If you burn his cover, I'll fucking kill you and bury in the woods. Did you know about Barkova? About Gauza? If you had shared that info, Markowski would be alive! They'd just change their route. We don't know who killed Markowski. Wisniak doesn't know either. - Then what the fuck is he there for? - Because Barkova is waging a turf war. Fucking leave Wisniak alone, and maybe we'll get to something. Clean this mess up. That's an order. Gauza hasn't moved his ass from Rzeszow. We're watching him all the time. I wanted to thank you for the hotel. You're welcome. Don't stay up till dawn. What's up? - Go to the john. - Giving him a work out? - Is that a problem? - He assaulted Aga. I'd have a problem if he slept the night through. What? Come here... Now talk. Barkova commissioned the hit on Markowski, yes or no? - Yes or no? - Fuck man, I don't know! Fuck! - Your knee will be next. - Are you deaf? I don't know anything! And that transfer, tomorrow? You're going on a trip. Just don't tell me it's for fucking plums. I'm driving the boss. - Where to? - Przemysl, I don't know why. Fucking happy? You've got a car 500 m from here. You'll tell them we wanted to interrogate you. I know who you are, they told me to let you go. I have no idea what are you talking about. Yes? You mentioned a conference in Przemysl? Tomorrow. Why? We need to stake it out, Barkova will be there. - That's the trip she's taking. - Damn, do you know who'll be there? Heads of Police, Border Guard, politicians, ours and foreign. There's your network. I guess he needs to explain herself for the mess on the border. - When does it start? - We've got a few hours. What is it? A bad dream? Will you tell me? Don't be afraid, no one will come here, it was just a dream. A spider... he had a spider on his neck. A tattoo? The man you saw had one? I'm scared for Ali. When will we get our phones back? - After the German border. - I need to know what's with my sister! A new driver will come in the morning. Don't leave the truck, piss in the bucket. Idiot! You'll give us all away! Look, here he comes. Fucking hanging out before the right with the hag? A ho in Poland can't get enough of me. Since you're such a hotshot, maybe you could give us a hand? You were to leave them in the woods. Right. But it was a shame not to fuck them. - Your job. - Fuck... - Ruski, let him be... - "Let him be", what? I need to know whom I'm working with. Fucking take it! How about I whack you? What? Trying to frame me? The Wife told you to leave them in the woods. 'Cause she's a broad! Fucking chill, man. It wasn't loaded. Inside in 5. - Wiktor Rebrow. - Welcome. - Yes? - The girl started talking. Get a sketch artist and a sworn translator, for the testimony. OK. KUCZER IS GOING UPSTAIRS Looking for someone? - Do we know each other? - Now we do. I'm Tatiana Barkova. I run a hotel in Borynia in Ukraine, - have you ever been there? - I only heard about it. Shame. It's a beautiful place, you should come visit. A friend of yours? I think I've seen her in my hotel recently. - You take me for someone else. - Really? You don't work with her? - Why would that interest you? - People interest me in general. You're searching for fugitives and were close friends with Commander Markowski. Is that right, Captain Rebrow? That's why this should be especially interesting for you. Excuse me. What took you so fucking long? English subtitles: Michal Kwiatkowski
