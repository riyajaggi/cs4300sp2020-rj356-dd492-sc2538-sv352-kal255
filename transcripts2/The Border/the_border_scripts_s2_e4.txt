 Halid? Halid?! Halid! Halid... I told you to stay put! He's been gone for 2 days. Something's gone wrong. He's from here. He knows the mountains. You lied to him! That's true. And he helped us! We can't trust anyone, understand? We've only got each other...

 You left me in the forest. I'm sorry... THE PACK Smoke grenades. There are two more over there. It's for nothing. They sprinkled some chemicals. That's why the dogs went batshit. They had machine guns, grenades. Motherfuckers were expecting some war... Aga is out of surgery. Unconscious. Keep me posted. How did you find out about that? Operational knowledge. Where's commander Markowski? They're examining the area.

 Will you take me there? Yes. He's up there. Hello? - I've got the data from the chatroom... - Can't this wait? One of the IP addresses belongs to commander Markowski. Are you sure? There is more there. You have to see it. When backup from Stuposiany arrives, change the men on the border. Send the rest to the southern east... I fuckin' got you! Loose your weapon. Go... slowly... You fuckin' moving. When we came here, he was cold. I swear, for fuckin' god's sake! Someone was here when we arrived. Rebrow ran after him. - Where? - Towards the river into Ukraine. - What the fuck where you doing here? - We were looking for Grzywa. - Who? - He was doing business with him. You want me to call the pigs? Sure! Why don't you cuff him? Fuck! Get rid of the shit! Cigs, vodka, everything shady must go! It must be spotless like the baby's bed! When the pigs see the corpse, they'll be looking even in your asses! Get the fuck out, before I change my mind. Fuck me! Fuck me! - He took money upfront? - As always for trafficking. So what those Ukrainians are waiting for? - Is anyone in touch with them? - No-one. Cinek would take our phones, so we wouldn't call our broads. He gave us prepaids. Safety measures... Then call the prepaids. Only he had the numbers. So we've got a fuckload of money... empty trucks... and goods stuck on the other side of the fucking border?! Yep. Fuckin' hell! Marcin Nowacki - Border Guard. Kamil Bak - police... Adam Kowalski - his father is also a cop. - All from around here? - Ustrzyki, Lesko - this area. - It's a local chatroom. - Shit! What about Rambo? Keep an eye on Markowski. Just be discreet. He saw me this morning. He might be cautious. What's up? I need a wire. But it has to be handled by someone from outside. It's Markowski. You overestimate me. I'll get you all the papers. With the Prosecutor's Office's stamp... Will you tell me what's going on? I can't. Not yet. Does your boss know you're cheating on him with the ABW? He doesn't look under my skirt. Look, mom. You alive? Do you hear me? Help me. She's in coma. She might not walk again. You wanna come in? No. No-one knew. Neither the family nor the guys. How was I supposed to tell them? I fucked up big time. You'll testify who contacted you, the number you texted to. Everything. Wait... I should've taken that bullet, not her. It wasn't Cinek who shot at us. It's not your fault. NATIONALISTS CHATROOM I know how to fuck those niggers. Where do we meet? - How long have I been asleep? - More than 24 hours. It's a wolf. From Halid. Where is he? He went out to get water. Drink while it's hot. Let me see. I've told you to stay put. There are traps... If we had listened to you, you'd be long gone. What happened there? Did you succeed? He got away. "He got away"? You said, you were looking for a lady friend. So who are you looking for? Her or the man from the photograph? Rest... Shut him up, Lena! Kalita's calling. I'm looking for my guys. They were with your girls. What happened then? How the fuck has no-one seen them for two days? Looking for something? - What do you want? - A partner. Why don't you check at the morgue? My condolences... Cinek was a good guy, although he made money on the side. I saw the trucks. What did you want to smuggle? Amphetamine? Coke? Is that what you lost in Ukraine? - I don't deal in that shit. - Someone has to clean that shit up. The Ruskis won't forget what you owe them. I can help you, Kalita. We'll forget about Cinek's fuck-up. You'll take the sawmill over, and our business. Just don't think about it too long. Shut him up, damn it! - You must attract those corpses. - Life... One shot. The bullet entered through the base of the skull. He died on the spot. An execution. He was dead for at least 30 hours before they brought him here. Enough time to clean up? Kalita found the body himself. The worker's had a day off. 'Cause he's the employer of the year. I'll be waiting outside. - Good morning... - Now! My boss. Your investigating the Border Guard? Markowski... A fucking Major! What else are you doing behind my back? Nothing that wouldn't be connected with the retorts. What happen if this lead gets you nowhere? You'll get fucking fired. I'll get fucking fired... I'm close. Trust me. - This has gone too far. - There is a mole in the Pack. I found quad tracks by the body in the woods. - And there's more. - It could've been any quad. But the vehicle registers disappeared from the Border Guard station. If I find that mole, I'll find out what happened in the retorts. A few days. That's all I need. You got 48 hours. If this thing goes south, I didn't know anything. Your husband... Was he going across with you that night? No. A few weeks earlier. So he's in Poland? I don't know. The Border Guard have their people up north, at the scene of the shooting. The southern sector is almost clear. It's a good moment to cross. Not now, please. I beg you. Just a few more days. We're out of touch with my husband. He hasn't texted for weeks. He'll be OK. Pack as much food as you need. And last night was the first one when Halid didn't have nightmares. He doesn't wake up or cry. It's all my fault. I did it to him. It's my fault he saw all this. And he's just 7 years old. You want to throw me out? I'd be sleeping under your door like a dog. - You don't know what we went through. - I do! And you still want us to go? You're just like them! 4.50. Is your son here? He went to get stuff. We were supposed to meet. The name of the detective on the case. The one the Syrian is planning to talk to. They want to do a line-up. Tell you son he ought to watch himself. You forgot your bolts. Yeah? We found a weapon. I'll be right there. It was lying a 100 meters from the scene. Guess whom is it registered to? - Was he in the Pack? - Fired. And now he's our guest. He came today on his own accord. He wants to talk to you. I'll handle it. He was suspected of hiding Rebrow? Yes. But there was no proof. Interesting, right? That much time in the forest. He must have had some help. - Do you know what this is? - You don't? A shotgun. It's totally legal. I lost it a week ago. At the scene of the shooting? Rebrow had it. I haven't heard from him for two days, that's why I came here. We heard someone near Cinek's corpse. Rebrow ran out, I stayed behind... It could've been Grzywa. - You haven't heard from Rebrow? - I know nothing. We need to find him. I have a load of shit up here! Let me know if you do. Show the gentleman out. Keep listening. I want to know who visits him, or when he takes a leak. Did you have a nice chat? I had to report it. Or you wouldn't get your wire. You've got your bosses. I've got mine. Refugees are one thing, but someone was shooting at Border Guards. You knew what you signed up for. They would've had my balls. And you tell me nothing. You don't have to stick your neck out for me anymore. Or your balls. You know where to find me. I've checked all of Markowski's posts. Have a seat. He's Jesion. Here. "Finally someone took care of them." He wrote it one day after the bodies have been found in the retorts. And that's what he wrote prior to the murders. He's been a chat-room user for two years now. Then he knew what they were planning at the retorts? He knew everything. Fuck me! NO NEW MESSAGES Beniowa - in an hour. You came back anyway. I had to. Will you help me? Some of Cinek's men are neo-Nazis. But there are also some in the Border Guard. They get organized through the chatroom. Markowski has been there for two years. During this time three racist-based cases went cold. A devastated cemetery, assaults on Ukrainians. The commander logs in regularly. And not only him... Cops, relatives of prominent town figures. All in all 30 people. Read this. Soon we'll have a bigger mess here than 4 years ago. - And how is this connected...? - With the retorts? The chat-room users suggested burning immigrants. A few months ago... I need to interrogate them, at one time. Otherwise they'll cook up a version. I have 24 hours. If you're wrong about this, they'll fire you or send to some Podunk? Worse than this? You were to stay put! You almost got busted. - Fuck off! - You got Luczak in trouble... We found the shotgun. Enough with the bushwhacking, or you'll fuck both of us up. I got this from Switalski with a question: who's that? He's not in any files or testimonies. Not here, not on the Ukrainian side. Fucker shows up at Cinek's house, after his death, as if he owned the place. Shadow? I suspect we stumbled onto his men in the woods. He's looking for someone to fill in for Cinek. Kalita isn't talking either. Switalski put some heat on him, but... And you think he'll tell me? Cinek was like a son to him. If Grzywa killed him, then you've got a mutual enemy. I was your age when my dad's left. And you know who helped me? Devils. My Grandma used to say there's balance in the world: where there's evil, there's got to be good. Where there are demons, there are those from above. Everywhere. But not here. Here it's only devils. Demons and fiends. Beats in sheep's clothing. Oh, they can help you. But you've got to be careful. They always want something in return... Will you fuck me? Beat it. The Poles are sealing the border. We need to hurry. And you know it from where? The Border Guard station? They didn't warn us last time. Your source... Last time someone else screwed up. The client pays for the stuff, not for fucking around. And we owe him one transport. Trouble? It's harder now. They know we didn't pass. You're that afraid of the Pole? The mole will take care of him. You do your job. Get the fuck out. Cinek played it out by exposing the illegals to the Border Guards, while trafficking goods via another route. For Shadow. And Grzywa. - You've got balls. - But Cinek wanted to fuck them over. He led them straight into the Pack. And that's why they whacked him. Why the fuck are you telling me this? - Help me find Grzywa. - Me? Helping you? They came here. If you won't do what they want, you'll end up dead, like Cinek. They'll take the sawmill. Look at you, Rebrow. I could fucking whack you here, and no-one would even look for you. I need to find Marta. Will you help me? It depends... if you find my men and stuff. What the fuck? Down! Get down! ABW, step out, please. Hands on the roof, spread them. What the fuck...? Could you explain it to me? You're a witness. Please answer the agent's questions. - Almost all of them. One wasn't home. - Who? Sylwester Wisniak. Cinek's man. We're checking the sawmill. Does this looks familiar? "Jesion". Registered user since 2015. Your last post is from yesterday... You knew they were planning the retorts' murder. Have you heard about the devastation of the Orthodox cemetery? - That's how it started. - How about the assault on Ukrainians? - You haven't answered my question. - I'm trying to. The Pack is a random group of people. Great at their job, but no one tests their worldviews. After the attack on the outpost in 2013 it was peaceful here for a while. Two years later, evidence started disappearing. First the trace evidence from the cemetery. - Someone let the suspects out... - What were you doing in Uherce? A suspects. I gave them a tip. A date of a line-up, to identify Nazim Malout's attackers. I had to gain their trust. Finally one guy responded. It turned out his father is a BG in Stuposiany. Could he have taken a quad and killed Miriam? I checked. He was on patrol with his team at that time. How long have you been conducting your private investigation? For more than 2 years now. But it's in the past now, considering what you've done. You're not the only one who didn't come to terms with the past events. Make a sound, and I'll kill you. I'm looking for Cinek's men. Where are they? Tell me! Halt, motherfucker! Call the boss, Kalita. Cinek's dead. The stuff must be delivered tomorrow. - Call! - Do it. Have you got a gun? - Where's the stuff? - Packed in backpacks. 25 packs. - We take the San River valley. - We're supposed to go through Zgnily. There are patrols all over the north. Give them food and drink. We're moving out in an hour. Sorry, I was busy. Your mother disappeared. She must've taken my keys. Please check the garden, there is a gate in the back, mother used it when she would go to the park. If you won't find her there, go up the street. I'll call you back. Have we got anything? A few flags, posters, "Poland for Poles". No direct links to the retorts. - And Wisniak? - Disappeared. Check his house, every corner and drawer. I come back tomorrow, I gotta have something. - And the warrant? - I'll deliver. A security guard found her by the shop. - I can't control her. - I'll arrange some help. - Who did this to her? - They found her with it. She should be at the care centre. Mom... It's you... It's me. You bitch! Give me my husband back! - Mom! - Step away, please. Easy, lay down. Come on, easy... Ukrainians. They'll be coming back along the same route. - Will we make it? - We have half an hour. We'll have to cross the river. There's no other way. Faster! - Mom! - Shut her up! Shut her up! If you shoot, you'll alarm them. Help me! On your knees! Shut your trap! The stuff and the people are 2 km from here. Your man is watching them. I'm to receive instructions. When? I'll let you know when I get them. You'll take the papers. - You're shitting me. - Halt! If you want to get Grzywa, take it, no fucking around. Rebrow! Good job. Hello? We're off to Wisniak's place in an hour. Will you be there? I'm on my way. Wisniak wasn't at the sawmill either. But the ABW secured this. The same calibre as the bullets from Cinek's head. - Search every inch of this place! - We have something. It's like a dozen of passports. All burned. - What country? - Syria. Fuckin' hell! Ukraine, Afghanistan, we gotta check the rest. Well, you saw him anyway... Fuck... Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine! Same as the retorts corpses. Tomorrow we'll match the rest. We had this motherfucker down at the station and we let him go! Stop! Border Guards! Border Guards. Halt! Do you speak Polish or Russian? Leave the kid. Don't be scared, Halid. Was someone with you? Talk to me! Look at me! Get in the car! Halid! English subtitles: Marcin Lesniewski
