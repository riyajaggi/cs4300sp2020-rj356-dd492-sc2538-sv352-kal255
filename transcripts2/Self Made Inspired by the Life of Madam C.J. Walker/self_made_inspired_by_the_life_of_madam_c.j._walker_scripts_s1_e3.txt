 One thing I learned about dreams... they do come true. When God dreams, he dreams big. And I decided to follow his example. I opened this factory only six months ago. And today, I have hundreds of factory workers and sales agents. I also have sold thousands of tins of my Wonderful Hair Grower. And I have one of the largest factories in Indianapolis. - I'm gonna get you. - You really ridin'. But my aspirations don't stop at these doors. Or with me.

 You're doin' it! Oh! I have a dream of helping to better all colored women. I'm gonna open salons with the Walker name all over the country. You see, I want you all to be just like me. Independent, self-sufficient women with their own businesses. Let me get a chance... So, this year, I'll be opening five new salons to be owned and operated by my top-selling sales agents. Ruby, Birdie, Mildred, Thelma, and Dora. Take a bow, ladies. If you become a Walker sales agent, you'll have a better job and more money. Madam CJ Walker will make sure all your dreams come true. Whoa! Oh!

 Oh! Oh, no. Are you okay? ♪ Coming from the bitty bitty bottom Of the basement ♪ ♪ The first course a force So I rise ♪ ♪ They wanna make it to the top Too quickly ♪ ♪ So I take steps And step more all the time ♪ ♪ Take a look at the flow of the future ♪ ♪ If you can't shake to it Then it don't suit ya ♪ ♪ Bad is the worst Some bad run soft ♪ Madam CJ's latest product, Glossine, is selling like hotcakes. Glossine is an oil that coats your hair before you hot comb it. What you lookin' for? Who, me? Nothin'. A breeze knocked these papers off the desk. Mm-hmm. I don't know what it is, but you're up to somethin'. I'm trying to be helpful, madam. You wanna be helpful? Go tell my daughter to stop pussyfootin' around on that bicycle like some kind of circus clown. Ain't there somethin' else I can do for you? You know, filin' maybe? Li'l such-and-such around the office? Y'all need to be cleanin' up the salon. I should be able to see my reflection on that floor. Yes, ma'am. - CJ. - Hey. I have some exciting news. No, I wanna tell you somethin' first. Now, now... Now, have a seat. Now, you keep saying you want a new ad campaign for your salons. Well, I came up with just the thing. What's all this? All right, now. What do you think of when you think of American beauty? You think of this. The Gibson girl. Well, the Gibson girl sells everything from soap to soup, and she looks beautiful whatever she does. And every man wants her, and every woman wants to be her. If you're white. Exactly. So who represents the epitome of colored beauty? Madam CJ Walker. Yeah, let me introduce you to the Gibson Girl in color. The Walker Girl. Well? What do you think? I've had enough of bicycles for one day. Well, so, I put her on a bicycle 'cause she's self-sufficient. She can get places under her own steam. Now she's the most beautiful colored girl in the world, and the only way to look like her is to get your hair done at one of those new Madam CJ Walker salons. Be a Walker Girl... and change your world. Mmm. Take a good look. Or take a picture, it'll last you longer. You know he's right. Put me in your ad, and you'll make millions. I'm the look people want, especially your customers. And even you, Sarah. Admit it. Deep down, you want to look like me too. And why not? I'm what sells. You need me. What do you say? Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Well? It's a good campaign, baby. - Now let me tell you my news! - Yeah. We are going to New York. Hot damn! We finally gon' have a vacation? What you got planned? Uh, dinner at the Marshall Hotel. You'll be sitting with Winston Moreland and his wife Josephine. He's a colored man that helps the 10 Cents and Less stores sell to our people. Yeah, this ain't no vacation. This is... This is work. Think of it as a working vacation. Helps my golf swing. Glossine could be the first colored product in the 10 Cents and Less. Which reminds me, Ransom. I wanna bring Mr. Moreland a special kit with the hot combs and Glossine wrapped up nice, so he can see how pretty they'll look on the shelf. We openin' five new salons. You talkin' about expandin'. We gon' be workin' all the time. That's what successful businesses do. They grow. Damn, Sarah. How big you wanna be? Big as Carnegie, Ford, and Rockefeller put together. Oh, come on, girl. Excuse me. Well, I better pack. Now, CJ, it should be the whole wide world. What's that? The slogan for the ad. Be better if it goes, "Be a Walker Girl, and change the whole wide world." Dinner's almost ready, Willa, come on! Sarah put on quite a show today. You must come hear her speak. Cousin Sweetness was lookin' for you. He still thinks he's an investor in Sarah's company. Hmm. Says he has all kinds of ideas he wants to talk to Sarah about. Yeah, I, uh... Lord have mercy, I don't know what he's talking about. Sounds like whatever he's talking about can get you into some mess with Sarah. Now, I know you and Madam have a lot going on in the company, but I'm here trying to keep home and keep this family together. What happened to that straight-arrow YMCA man I married? Right here, Nettie, dear. Good. I'm worried that Sweetness could get you fired. - You did tell her, right? - Oh, yes, months ago. Sarah was very understanding. Everything's fine. I took care of it. Good. Dinner's ready, Willa. Come on! You know, I've been thinkin'. Instead of using this new ad campaign just for the salon, I should show it to Mr. 10 Cents and Less in New York. Could be just the ticket to close the deal on Glossine. Mmm. I've been thinkin' too. You don't have to go if you don't want to. - What? You don't want me to go? - No! Of course I do. That's why I asked. I'm just really worried about Lelia. It might be better if I took her instead. Lelia, you know that girl ain't got a business bone in her body. That's exactly why I need to bring her. She's fussin' on account of her marriage. All she does is mess around with that Esther girl like it's playtime. Well, she certainly don't act like a married woman, that's for damn sure. She needs to be respectable. Mm-hmm. I'd love to get her away from John and more involved with the company. That boy? He ain't no good for nobody. So you see why I feel like we need more mother-daughter time? Yeah. But I still think you should take the ad. Okay, CJ. I wanna watch the newsreel. I want to see what this Mr. Moreland thinks. Yes, of course. I'll bring it. That's my Walker Girl. Thank you kindly, Peter. That'll be all for this evening. Uh, I don't have just quite enough cash today, but I will have wages for you tomorrow. Hello? Addie? I'm here, Ma. Addie, are ya there? I can't hear ya. I can hear you, my dear. Put the phone receiver right next to your ear. Can you hear me now? That's better. What you been up to? Well, working. Busy as usual. Well, I just thought it'd be nice to hear a friendly voice. Praise Jesus. I could use a little more cash this month. Well, I'm sorry, business is tight right now. Oh, I don't believe that! Not for a high-yellow gal like you! Doesn't make it any easier, my dear. Competition's a little tougher than I expected. There's this awful woman. She built a factory. I hear that she's opening salons with her name on them all across the country. Then you need to get you somethin' of your own. Compete with her! I was thinking about starting my own beauty school. I need more people to know who Addie Munroe is. I'm... I... I'm worried, my dear. Well, I ain't ever worried about you. Massa may have cursed me with a daughter, but you got good hair and light, bright skin! You'll be fine. Well, I guess I better go. I have to be up early in the morning to open up the salon. Well, all right, then. You take care. And have a blessed day. Operator. I'd like to speak to Dora Larrie. I'll wait. ♪ Do the Harlem Shake... ♪ I have traveled all over this country. Thought I'd seen every type of colored man, woman, and child. But this takes the cake. I feel like I died, and I went to colored heaven. This must be what Du Bois was talking about when he said, "The New Negro." We are lookin' at the future, right here. Someone who represents the epitome of colored beauty. The Gibson Girl in color... Mama! You okay? Mmm. - Best get goin'. - Okay. Come on. We have to hurry across town and pick up the hot combs. Well, look at who's still here. Thought you and Madam were going to the Empire State. Well, I thought she should probably take Lelia with her. A little mother-daughter time. Besides, Lelia needs to learn the business, you know? You sure is a good man, CJ Walker. Since Sarah left you all alone, you oughta come out dancing again. Yeah. Maybe I will. In the meantime, can I help you with somethin'? Why, yes. I need another box of tins. Make that two. Two? You sure you can sell those? Everybody knows I'm red hot in sales. Why do you think Sarah gave me the franchise in Chicago? 'Cause you're the best. You got that right. Two. One, two. Here you go. Now, you know I can't carry all that home by my lonesome. I reckon I can... escort you home. You sure is a gentleman, CJ Walker. CJ, you here? Mr. Walker! Ransom? ♪ Anybody? ♪ Yes, sir. ♪ Ezekiel saw the wheel Way up in the middle of the air ♪ ♪ Ezekiel saw the wheel ♪ ♪ Way in the middle of the air ♪ ♪ The big wheel run by faith ♪ ♪ The little wheel Run by the grace of God ♪ ♪ A wheel in a wheel Way in the middle of the air ♪ I see you. Eyeing that gal like she was a steak and you were starvin'. You are askin' for trouble. I came back, didn't I? Besides, I'm entitled to have a little bit of fun. You wanna know how me and your mama managed to stay together? Well, I'm guessin' Massa didn't give you much choice. I wanted to be married! Hey, Pop! Sarah the one who's always gone. Sarah the one always busy. - It's hard bein' a... - Hard? Boy, please! You wanna talk about hard? Listen, Massa sent your mama down road to Bismi Plantation 'cause he lost a bet. After that, I only got to see her on Saturdays when Massa give us passage to go courtin'. Your mama? Always done up nice. Ribbons in her hair. String up some honey chestnuts around her neck. I put on a clean shirt. A clean shirt? That's it? A clean shirt in a dirt-floored shanty ain't no easy thing! Point being, I tried. She tried. Yeah, it must've been tough when she decided to run. I told you she, uh, got shot. Yeah. Headed North to freedom. - She was headed North. - Yeah. She turned back. To be with us. I lost my better half. Son, you and me, we need a good woman to survive. I'm trying. True love is somethin' most folks won't ever know, man. You got that now with Sarah. You 'bout to lose it, because, what? You ain't get enough attention? You lonely? Get a hobby. Because whatever it is you're feelin' right now, trust me, regret hurts worse. For you. My husband sends his apologies. I'm truly sorry Mr. Walker was feeling poorly. That's for you. Oh, how lovely! Thank you! I adore your products. Such quality. And I'm excited to try the hot comb too. Isn't this marvelous, Winston, dear? Oh, what's marvelous is this hotel. I've never been anywhere like this before. Few places like it uptown, too. - You been to Harlem yet? - Yes. Is it true what they say? Oh, yes! Some of the people there are very free. About color, about life, about love. Anything goes. - Anything? - Mm-hmm. That sounds good to me. I mean, good for business. The only business I care about right now is getting Glossine into the 10 Cents and Less stores, Mr. Moreland. There's no other product like it on the market. I know it'll do well for you. I have the numbers right here. You see, the 10 Cents and Less is one of the few chains that accepts our people. Seems only right we be represented on the shelves. Give folks a sense of pride. Most men who try to sell me something are a lot more self-serving. John Rockefeller says, uh, "It's my duty to make money and use it for the benefit of my neighbors." Let's order. I think I'll have a steak. Mmm. Now why on God's green earth did you call us all over here, Dora? - This is my prime selling time. - If I want that fur coat before winter, I need to be knockin' on doors and makin' money. I invited you here to tell you how you can make more money. And work less hours. That doesn't sound like Sarah. Has nothin' to do with ol' Madam Misery Guts. But we all about to have our own salon franchises. Hmm. Sarah's been sayin' that. For months. Y'all seen any plans? Or paperwork? But, she's got plenty of time to go off gallivanting with her daughter to New York. What's this about? What are you sayin', Dora? I'm sayin' we don't have to work for Sarah. We got options. Hello, ladies. Mind if I join you? Apollo Theater? Oh, darlin', isn't that W.E.B. Du Bois? Oh, my God, it is W... W.E.B Du Bois in the flesh. He's a regular. NAACP meet right there, at that table, all the time. Wanna meet him? Winnie and he go way back. Oh, I wouldn't wanna bother the man. Well, I do. Come on, Mama, let's say hello. - Billy D! - Winnie, old man! Good to see you! And Josephine, beautiful as always. - I'd like to introduce you... - Madam CJ Walker! You know who my mama is? Why, sure. You're the lady who stood up to Harvard's Huckleberry Booker T. Washington at his conference. That was you? It sure was! Madam, you were the talk of the NAACP for months. Been wanting to shake your hand ever since. Oh, me too. I mean, your hand. And anybody who sticks it to the great compromiser ol' Booker T... is all right in my book. Well, it was a pleasure, madam. Here's my card. Keep in touch. Enjoy your evening, folks! William. I think Glossine would make a fine addition to the 10 Cents and Less. So do I. Unfortunately, it's not up to me. It's up to the board. Bunch of cranky old white men. But you do deserve a shot. And I'm gonna give it to you. Why, Sarah? Why won't you show my ad? Well, I didn't need to. Mr. Moreland loved my pitch, and the board is coming to tour the factory in a few days. I think I'm in! Yeah, but my ad could... I didn't bring it, CJ. It just wasn't right. I've been an ad man for 13 years. I know what sells. You just don't wanna listen to me. No, you're not listening to me. I keep saying I want my products to be for all colored women. Yeah, you just don't wanna take my ideas. CJ, you don't understand. When I got here, I saw all kinds of colored women from down South, Africa, the Caribbean. That's the kinda beauty I wanna show. And that's why the Walker Girl isn't right. She's... She's... She's outta date, and I'm here looking at the future. Oh, so now, I'm too old. Do you know how much money we could make? Rockefeller money! Yeah, whatever, Sarah. All you care about is money. CJ, I'm tired. Can we please just talk about this when I get home in a few days? - All right, bye. - I love... Ransom, I got here as quick as I could from the train station. We've got to get ready for the 10 Cents and Less board members. - What's the matter? - Your top five sales agents. They're gone. Gone? What do you mean, "gone"? They all went to work for Addie Munroe. Those traitors! They're not gonna do this to me. No, sir, not today, not with the board coming! What are you gonna do? Addie poached my sales agents. I'm gonna poach 'em back, startin' with my best gal. That's what I'm gonna do. Morning, madam, and good afternoon. Apprentice Ransom, but the folks call me... Sweetness. I'm familiar with your husband, but I haven't yet had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of such a fine gentlewoman. You're the numbers banker. Started from humble beginnings to help my community, much like yourself. Now I am greatly obliged to be a proud investor in this here factory. Investor? Hmm. Ransom, what is he talking about? Wait in my office. Upstairs. Go. Pleasure to meet you. Mmm. Ransom. Uh... He bought some shares in the business. That money you gave me was from the numbers banker? Yes, but, he is more... White folks catch a whiff of me involved in anything remotely illegal, and they will put me under the jail. Sweetness has other legitimate ventures. It doesn't matter. You know I have to be above reproach. I do, and you are. I promise you, madam, Sweetness does nothing... I have to be able to trust you, Ransom. You can trust me, madam. I can't deal with this right now. You need to fix this. Now! Sorry, Ms. Lucille, I'll keep it down! Dora, it's Sarah. I'd like to have a word if I could. Oh, shit! My shirt. - Hide! - Where? You're a ruffian and a rascal! I cannot let this foolish behavior stand! I'm just trying to improve my damn self. Why you tryin' to hold me down? I know things haven't been easy, but this is bigger than you! Because you're trying to keep me small, but I'm not letting nothing snatch my chance again. Now, you took my money. That makes me an investor. No. I'm afraid you don't un... Sarah. You caught me at a bad time. Look, you can't just leave me. We gotta talk this out. We gotta talk it out. - CJ, what the hell are you doin' here? - Baby. I've been trying to talk some sense into Dora, all morning, and now that you're here, maybe you can convince her to stay. All morning, huh? All morning. What happened to your shoes, CJ? Huh? - What happened to your shoes? - This is... It's business, Sarah! I'm trying to get her to stay! Come on, Sarah, baby. Now, come on, talk to me, baby. - Get... - Come on. Out of all the strumpets you could've been with. That high-yellow heifer is out here tryin' to destroy me! Let me explain to you, baby. She was supposed to open my Chicago salon! I'm trying to build something with this business, CJ. You care more about the damn business than you care about us! Us? Us? How long you been sleepin' with her? She make you feel good? She make you feel like a real man? I am a man, goddamn it! But you ain't no kinda woman. You don't cook nothin' for me no more. You act like you forgot what a wife's supposed to do. You done forgot all about your husband! Well... What about me? I am a man, and Dora knows it. And that's why I slept with her. - Sarah. - Get away from me. Sarah! Come on now! Come on, Sarah! Come on! Open the door now. Open the door! Sarah! Sarah! I swear, I've never seen more beautiful Negroes. Mmm! And the way that they wore everything made rags look like kings' robes. And I wore a turban on my head, just like this. No, stop it, Lelia. You're gonna mess up my hair! Don't matter! In New York, you can wear your hair however you like. - Mm-hmm. - I wish I could've been there. I know you would've loved taking all kinds of pretty pictures with your camera in Harlem. I never seen you this excited about any place before. Not even John's Juke Joint. Now, that's all make-believe, but New York? I didn't know they allowed people to live like that. It makes me wonder. What's it like in Paris? Or Rome, or London? You may as well be talking about Mars or the moon. Anything is possible. It'd be nice to live somewhere else. You mean, without your husband? I better get back to work, Little Miss Daydreamer. I'm serious, Esther. When I was there, I finally felt alive. New York feels like home. You been fighting with Sweetness. You lied to me. But I won. And I use the best all-natural oils. What my cheaper competitors fail to understand is that their alcohols don't work on colored hair. This seems very efficient. Sarah! Looks a little like Henry Ford's new moving assembly line method. Well, that's the idea. - Increasing productivity. - Sarah! Where the hell are you at, woman? Excuse me. Hey. Who all these Grays here? Now I know you not in here having a meeting without me. - CJ, what are you doin'? - You locked me out of my house. You ain't gettin' rid of me, Sarah. Did she tell you that this is my factory too? Nah, she ain't tell you all that, huh? Gentlemen, please come this way. Oh, no. You gon' just ignore me now? Like always, now you the one sneakin' around on me. Cheatin' on me with this business! Are you an owner as well? Shh! Finally! Some respect. And from a white man! - CJ, stop. - And get your hands off me. - We've seen all we need to see. - Yes, we have a train to catch. - We'll show ourselves out. - Y'all have a good day. Gentlemen, please. Hey! Just give me my... I just want my hat. Give me my hat! Give him his hat. Hey! Hey! Give me my hat! Give him his hat. Where your husband at, gal? Jesus, you scared me. I don't know where John is. Don't care. See, that's the problem right there. I don't got time for your plantation riddles, Mr. Cleophus. Ain't no riddle. Your husband been sneakin' around with that no good Addie Munroe. What now? How do you know? - Porter over at Addie's! Peter? - Mm-hmm. We were on the same plantation. Told me your John been visiting Addie on the regular. What you laughin' at, gal? That ain't supposed to make you happy. Is he sleepin' with her? No. Worse. - Worse? - Mm-hmm. Oh. Is it opium? Did he kill somebody? Tell me everything. Couldn't find Sarah's formula in the house. It's probably in the safe in the factory. Best learn to pick locks if you wanna make any more money. What you gonna do with it? Print it in the newspapers. Give it out for free if I have to. Put the beloved Madam out of business once and for all. With Sarah out of business, you ain't got no more use for me. So whatever you think you might be willing to pay, double it. Right there. You lowdown, dirty scoundrel. John Robinson. I can explain. I was just making some extra dough doing odds and ends for Addie, that's all. Liar. You were spying. Runnin' your mouth to Addie about Mama's business. You the lying-ass liar. You ol' nasty, nappy-headed sinner. What's funny? I been tryin' to figure out a way for months to get outta this raggedy marriage. Should've known sooner or later you'd mess up. The only way I messed up was by marryin' the likes of you. That's the last check you get to cash livin' sweet off of me. I'm divorcing you. Oh, no, I'm leaving you. In fact, I already done left. Oh, so you dancin'? Yeah, on your grave. Well, this be me dancin' on your grave. Ha! Yeah! Oh, that's all you got? That's all you got? That's all you got? Move, Lester! You can't divorce me, Lelia! I'm divorcing you! - Bye! - Move! Man, what you doin' here, Chester? You supposed to be my friend. Bye, sinner! Thanks for packing my bags, sinner! Bye! Hmm. I was like this. Then I hit him with the... Mm-mm-mmm! - I wish I could've seen his face. - Oh, he was like this! He was mad! You're free now. You can do whatever you want. - You still wanna live in Harlem? - You know I do. Come on, then. You serious? You'll leave your family and everything? For me? New York is the photography capital of the world. I would open up a Walker Salon. Meet new fancy people. Oh, I would go to fancy bars every night. Best part is my mama would pay for all of it. You sure? You let me worry about that. You just pack your bags and meet me at the train station tomorrow. Mama, you cookin' now? We gon' be late for church! Well... they'll just... have to start without me. You go on ahead. - You okay? - I'm fine. Never better, in fact. I just slept funny, is all. Mama, I know you slept alone last night. I know you did too. So there. I'm fine means I'm fine, and I'll thank you kindly to stop asking. Well, at least let me fix your hair. Can't have you walkin' into the church with your hair all frayed. Come on, sit. Mmm. You know, I can't stop thinkin' about New York. - We should move there. - What? Just like that? Pick up and leave the factory? I don't think so. Then let me open a salon. I'm ready to do it just like you. I'm gonna put everything I got into the business. Lord knows I been prayin' to hear you say them words, but my best sales agents just up and left. I can't lose you now, too. I'm... Mm-mmm. Well, don't let those ingrates steal your dream, Mama. I can open up a new salon in Harlem, get things back on track. If we don't do it, somebody else will. Somebody like Addie. Don't talk to me about Addie. I'm doin' what I'm doin'. I ain't thinkin' about nobody else. Hurry up, now, we gonna be late for church. - Hi. - Hi. You're gonna be all right because you're a survivor, like me. Thank you, Cleophus. - If you're white, you're all right. - Mama! If you're brown, stick around. If you're black, get back. What? That's why they went to Addie. They like her better. No, you don't know that. Every head turns when Addie Munroe walks into a room. Ain't nobody ever looked at me that way. Not your daddy, not CJ. Mama! Everybody wants a light, bright gal with silky hair. You and me, we gotta work harder. Be smarter. And get rich. From now on, I'm puttin' my face on all the ads and the tins. And I'm sending you to New York. You don't need to be no Negro-lookin' Gibson Girl to succeed there. And I want you to march into Harlem and set that place on fire.
