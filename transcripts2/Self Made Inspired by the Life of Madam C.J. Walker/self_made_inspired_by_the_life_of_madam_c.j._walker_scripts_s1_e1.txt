 It came to me in a dream. Hair is beauty. Hair is emotion. Hair is our heritage. Hair tells us who we are, where we've been, and where we're going. My name is Sarah Breedlove. Making products for our hair is my passion. Hasn't been easy, but no matter what, I refuse to give up the fight. Addie Munroe's Magical Hair Grower!

 Fifty cents a tin. Get Magical Hair Grower right here! You got dandruff, ma'am? You got bald patches? Hair that won't grow? I got your fix! Right here, ladies! Magical Hair Grow... Heard of that stuff. Do it work? Saved my life. Hair is power. You can't imagine what it's like to lose it. Seems like I was born to struggle. The life of a washerwoman is hard. I'd scrub my fingers to the bone for pennies. Most days, I can't even make ends meet.

 After a while, I guess I just lost hope... forgot how to dream. That's when my hair started falling out. My husband Davis only made things worse. He was arrested, and when he came back, he was a changed man. You look like a mangy dog. - Baby, wait, don't go. - No. Please. Davis. I was devastated. Didn't know what I was gonna do. I used to wonder if God don't like ugly, why did he make me? With so much beauty in this world, how come I got so little? And then everything changed. I'm Addie Munroe, and I would like to talk with you about my new hair product. Um... You all right? Is anyone here? I'm... I'm gonna help you. It's gonna be just fine. Oh, dear. Oh, it's okay. What happened? I started using the Hair Grower that day. In a few months' time, my hair came back. Hmm. Aw. Look at how your hair is growing. Thanks to you. I don't know why I'm so surprised. My Magical Hair Grower is magical. Yes, indeed, Addie. Yes, indeed. Addie's Hair Grower worked. My hair grew back. And so did my confidence. Now I got me a new man, CJ, who loves me and treats me right. My hair grew back so good, I thought, maybe I could sell it myself. That's why I wanna sell your Hair Grower. That's why I wanna sell your Hair Grower. That's why I wanna sell your Hair Grower. But what do I say when the customers complain about the sulfur smell? Oh, smile and say, "That's how you know the product is working." Here. I put it on at night. Tie it up real good. By morning, the smell's gone. Mostly. Now that's a tasty idea. Thanks. If a washerwoman like Sarah can figure it out, y'all should have no problem. You've just got to convince the customers that by using my product, that they'll look like me. Or you all, at least. What? No. No... But, it... It works. Trust me. You gals will be fine. You'll get the hang of it soon. In the meantime, just smile a lot. Hmm. Okay? They just get younger and dumber, don't they? Hmm. Oh. Ah... Maybe I could sell your product. I'd be honored, in fact. Oh. I don't think sales is for you. I've been singing your praises for almost two years. I got you, what? Eight new customers? Mmm. That's not the same as selling door-to-door, though. Oh, I know everything about Hair Grower. I'm proof that it works. Sarah, I know what I'm doing. It's business. Nothing personal. Hiring a bunch of mulatto gals to con folks ain't gonna work. Even a fool knows they didn't get good hair from your product. Their mamas and grandmamas got raped. Language. All I'm saying is... when a customer looks at my hair, they'll know they're seeing what your product can do. Colored women will do anything to look like me. Even if deep down they know they can't. Now we've got a good arrangement here. Laundry for hair treatments. Let's not complicate things. You saw the laundry in the back. I'll have it for you on Friday. I was hesitant at first, but then I realized... this is my calling. That I could help others the way Addie helped me. And that's why I'm here. It worked for me. It'll work for y'all. That's one hell of a story. Give me one tin. Thank you. Me too. - I'll take one. - How much is it? She said it grow hair? Thank you, baby. It's worth the money. I can't wait to try! Let me know how you doin' with it. Check back in. - All right, then! - Thank you! ♪ Allow me to pick up where I left off ♪ ♪ The biggest phenomenon And I'm Picasso with a pen ♪ ♪ They just wanna talk that stuff Till I hit 'em with the realness ♪ ♪ I said it with my chest And I don't care who I offend, uh-huh ♪ - Sarah? What are you doin' here? - I did it. I sold 20 tins. What now? I borrowed a few tins of your Hair Grower. After I told you no? Just to see if I could sell 'em! But you can't. It don't make sense! - I figured if I just showed you... - You stole from me? After everything I've done for you? No, I'd never steal from you! I brought all the money. It's all for you! I got you back on your feet. I confided in you. How could you? I just wanted to show you that I can sell. We can make a lot of money together. I got ideas... Are you out of your mind? Even in your Sunday best, you look like you just stepped off the plantation. These are my products. And I will not have the likes of you associated with them. Sorry for overstepping. It won't happen again. Sarah! For Addie's newest sales agent. What happened? I ain't got the right look. Now, wait a minute, now you... You're the most beautiful woman in the world. - Stop. - No. All these years I done made ads, I'd drawn every type of face there is. And ain't none more beautiful than yours. Tell me what happened. She treated me like I was nothing, CJ. I thought we was friends. Week after week, I sat in that chair. Told her stuff I ain't never told nobody. I should've known I was just a customer to her. And an ugly one at that. Okay, stop. I ain't gonna let you keep beating up on yourself, you hear? You hear me? I love you, CJ. Mmm. Come here. What you makin'? From now on, I'm doing my own hair, making my own hair grower. I'm through with Addie Munroe. Mama! What you doin' up? Just workin' on a little something. Sit, there's something I wanna try. What is it? Hair grower. Maybe. Just something I'm fiddling around with. Mmm. Smells better than Addie's already. Just trying to figure out the right mix. Where you been? Ray Ray's Bar was hot tonight, and me and John was dancing the Big Bear Dance all night long. Just... mm-mm-mmm. - John, huh? - Mm-hmm. The guitar player? Sit... Sit your behind down! What did I tell you about that sponger? You ain't even met him yet. I can tell by the way you talk about him, he ain't got no money. I know you think I'm puttin' on airs. But... you ain't cute or clever enough to survive gettin' knocked up by some do-nothin' musician. Gotta find somebody who'll make your life better. Like CJ. Not having this conversation again. You're too idle. You need to call Dr. Collins. He stood me up, remember? That glass eye he got give me the willies. So? He's a doctor. And you ain't gettin' much younger. You either go to college or find yourself a husband, you hear? What's wrong? My scalp is on fire, Mama. Okay, that's the last time I make it with lye. Come on! Ooh! Just gotta get it out. ♪ Get ready ♪ ♪ Get set ♪ ♪ Let's go ♪ ♪ Let's go ♪ ♪ Let's go Get ready, get set, let's go ♪ - ♪ Go! ♪ - ♪ Won't stop for the bumps in the road ♪ - ♪ Whoo ♪ - ♪ Won't stop even when they say no ♪ ♪ It's what I want So all I know is... ♪ Thank you, sister Sarah. My hair grew two inches! God bless you. Hair Grower works! Mama, you did it! You made a beautiful hair grower. I'm so proud of you. - Here you go. - Okay. ♪ Get set, let's go ♪ ♪ Get ready, get set, let's go ♪ - ♪ Let's go ♪ - ♪ Let's go ♪ Sarah, I hear you. Open up. Just a minute! Addie. Sarah. A few weeks ago, you left clean laundry on my doorstep. Then, nothing. Thought maybe the Klan got you. Well, been a little sick. You might not wanna get too close. You can imagine my surprise when I heard Sarah Breedlove not only lives... but is out testing hair grower. - Me? That ain't... - Better not be my tins. Rest assured... we're settled up. You really think you can compete with me? Suit yourself, but you'll fail soon enough. And when you do, I got a hamper full of dirty laundry with your name on it. - CJ! - Hmm? - CJ! - Hmm? Your sister wants me to send her 20 jars of Hair Grower, and she sent me money. Peg... Peggie sent money? It's a miracle! I think God is finally smiling down on me. She said she let her choir director try some of the product I sent, and now all the sopranos want it. Huh. It says here, more Negroes are moving to Indianapolis. Property is cheap now on account of the recession and factories closing. - Hmm. - Huh. As soon as Negroes move in, white folks run for the hills. Can you imagine? Ofays go broke and they just up and close a factory, I mean, a whole factory, just like that. Mmm. How is Cleophus gettin' along all by his lonesome? - Only your sister to look after him? - Daddy's doin' just fine. Hmm. What you gettin' at? Mmm. My product is just as good as Addie's. Maybe better. Definitely smells better. Hmm. I can't be a washerwoman for the rest of my life, CJ. Miss Jessie said there's three million Negro women in America. If I can get 'em all to buy just one jar of Hair Grower, I'll be a millionaire. - Well, I can't argue with that. - Yeah. Hmm. We'd have to leave St. Louis, though. I'd never get anywhere in Addie Munroe's shadow. I ain't movin' to Indianapolis. I love you, but I ain't movin'. I ain't movin'. Indianapolis, here we come! Where is Lelia? She better not make us miss this train. Breaking up with John, thank Jesus. Mama! Mama! We got hitched. You almost had me. Nice to finally meet you, John. You're a good sport to help with her luggage. - But we gotta be on our way. - No, Mama. John is my husband. He's comin' with us. Nice to meet you, Mom. Lord, what did you do? I got married, like you said. Welcome to the family, son. - Good luck. - You pregnant? No! I love him. And he's not a do-nothin' either. John's gonna open a juke joint. - A juke joint? - Mm-hmm. Let's go. I did like you said. I found a rat. Oh. Easy, Cleophus. Money's tight. We gotta make it stretch. Missy, I sure don't mind helpin', but I don't take orders no more. Lincoln freed me 40 years back! That's why I'm gonna pay you. And that's why you're my favorite daughter-in-law! Keep your eyes on your work. You're spilling more than you're filling. Can I have my paper back? If you don't like it here, you're welcome to find yourself other lodging, gainful employment. Yeah, how's that juke joint coming? From now on... you on rat duty. And take that hat off! You're inside. Yes, ma'am. Living room window. Baby, you got to show the people some razzle-dazzle. Some hope! Well, but not false hope. I ain't promisin' long, silky hair or whatever you put in this ad. - What you want me to change? - Work in my story. Make it personal. Add some testimonials or something. Folks will take a chance on my product if they believe in me. Right, Peggie? Yup! You gotta have heart. Okay. Okay, Peggie. I'll see what I can do. Hmm. Walker Hair Company. Got a nice ring to it, don't it? Gotta admit, you're sure on to something. Hair is in our blood. All your uncles were barbers. Just 'cause they've gone on to glory don't mean their legacy gotta die too. One day all of this will be yours. I want you to learn the business. - Why? - Do something with your education. I got a husband now. Who is about as useful as a bucket without a bottom. Well, John and I are still gonna open up that juke joint. I think he found a barn just outside of town. - Thank you. - There you go. After all I went through to get out of the South? Washed clothes till my hands were raw to put you through school. Maybe even college. Now all you wanna do is serve liquor to ex-cons and hustlers. Hair is your dream, not mine. - So what's your dream? - I don't know yet. So what happens when John runs off with a bar floozy? Then what? Either you're back with me, or you're whoring. Well, John says I have a knack for entertaining. Right. So whorin', then. You can be so cold-blooded sometimes, Mama. All I'm sayin' is don't gamble your future away on that man. Any man! Always make your own money. - But... - Nope, no buts. - How you doin', ma'am? - Good mornin'. My name is Lelia, and this is my mama. We have a product here that I'm sure will change your life. Now, when I tell you this will make your hair grow faster than anything... ♪ Have I been hiding? ♪ ♪ Wasting all my days ♪ ♪ Did I give up on all my dreams? ♪ ♪ No, no, no ♪ ♪ My heart is beating ♪ ♪ I'm alive like a baby ♪ ♪ Today is the day that I succeed ♪ ♪ It's been a long... ♪ Y'all ready? ♪ It took a while too ♪ ♪ 'Cause I got it now ♪ CJ, go downstairs and get some more boxes. I don't want my customers to leave empty-handed. Of course, babe. Thank you. You want me to warm up the leftovers? I think we made a mistake in moving here. Gotta figure something out. Quick. 'Cause we're almost out of money. The new hotel downtown... they hiring. I figure you and me, we can go down there, and... I could be a bellhop, you can do laundry. You don't just plant a seed and expect fruit the next day. The colored women here gotta get used to the idea of somebody else doin' their hair, that's all. Baby... you know I always love your big ideas, but... - I'm not going back to laundry! - Now wait a minute, now. We done all made sacrifices. You gonna do what's best for this family. You hear? Sarah. Sarah. Stop. You got two weeks to turn this around. After that, you gonna do whatsoever it takes to keep food on that table. - Gentlemen, Wonderful Hair Grower? - No, thank you.

Wonderful Hair Grower? Thank you very much! Yeah, I'm gonna try this! - Need this! - We was talkin' about this. Extra, extra! Read all about it! Black Jack Johnson takes on the Great White Hope in the fight of the century! Sisters! Sisters! Let's talk about hair. - You all right with that there? - Yeah, I'm good. Hair can be freedom or bondage. The choice is yours. Want a better station in life? What is she sayin'? Need to make more money? Come on. Let me show you how. Let's hear what she talkin' about. I had a Cain versus Abel relationship with my hair. - Bet some of y'all do too, huh? - Oh, yeah. See, I was born free. Two years after emancipation. Was orphaned by seven. Married at 14, pregnant at 15, widowed by 20. Had to fend for myself and my baby girl. Only work I could find was... in the fields... or as a washerwoman. Mm-hmm. Didn't have time to take care of my hair. I know you know what I mean. - Yes. - Hard work on the farm, ain't it? Wanted to work at the new hotel, but they say I ain't got the right look. How many of y'all know what she talkin' about? Yes, indeed. They put us down, don't give us nothin'. Tell us we're ugly, make us feel ugly. That's right. I tell you what. You come by my salon, I'll do your hair for free. You got yourself a deal. Ooh! Bet you some of y'all are wonderin' why I would do somethin' for nothin'. Right. 'Cause I know how hard it is to care for our hair. Mmm. I know what it's like to not have running water or products made for us. But most important, I know if she look good, we all look good. - Yes! - Right about that. If you look respectable, we all look respectable. Mmm. That's right. Everything we do as Negroes reflects back on us. So if I can help one person, I'm lifting us all up. - Yes, lift us. - Okay. Wonderful Hair Grower gives me the confidence every day... ...to beat the enemy. Slay the demon. Fight the good fight as a colored woman in America. You gotta stand up. Wonderful Hair leads to wonderful opportunities. - Yes. Amen! - You hear me? - Did you hear me? - Yeah, I heard you. Now, who wants wonderful opportunities? Come on up and get your opportunity. Thank you. Sarah, we need more shampoo! - You're taking too long! - I'm not gonna rush and burn her. I'm just asking you to hurry. Customers can hear y'all. We need more pullers and pins and oil. - We need help, Sarah. - Help is on the way. Now I sent Lelia out for supplies, and a gal named Esther, who came highly recommended, will be here any minute. That's all well and good, but I need to finish this one's hair now. - You know how to use a hot comb? - I do. Be right back. Mrs. Walker. - I'm Esther. - Oh. I can do hair. I can make product. Anything you need. Check these ladies. See who's dry. Get some Hair Grower and oil their scalp, don't start pressin' till I make sure you know what you're doin'. - Sarah! - Coming! Sarah! Okay! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm sorry. - Hey. - Yeah. Hey. I'll be right back. Excuse me for a second. - Listen, we need more help. - I know. Ain't it wonderful? The Hair Grower's doing so well. We should put out more product. - We barely got enough room to live. - Then let's get a bigger place. Babe... We just now making a profit. Can we just enjoy it? Tonight... why don't we get a couple of steaks and a bottle of Cognac and sleep in in the morning? I want a whole line of products. Shampoo, pressin' oil, maybe somethin' for dandruff? I'm gonna make it easier for colored women to take good care of their hair. There's such a thing as growing too fast. That's why we gotta be smart about it. Do things professional-like. You know any lawyers? Oh, Sarah. Sweetness. Yeah, he been braggin' about his cousin just finished law school. Since when you been talkin' to the numbers man? You want me to call him or not? Mister! Ma'am, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I studied incorporation at Columbia, yes. So you'll look into it? Mrs. Walker, business can be ruthless. - Especially for a... - Colored woman? Can't be no worse than taking in laundry. You'll be competing with companies that make their products for pennies in big factories. That's why I need me a good lawyer. Interested? You beat my suitcase, boy? No, sir. You niggers think you're Jack Johnson now. Treat a white man's property any old way. No, sir. I carefully placed it on the cart. Don't know how it could've gotten scratched. You're calling me a liar, boy? How soon can I start? That's... That's what I'm sayin', Pop. We got big plans for our company. First thing we're gonna do is do what they call incorporating. Make everything legal. Boy, you ain't got no sense. - What's that you're mumblin' about? - You keep sayin' "our company." - Sarah calls it her company. - So? You ain't listenin'. Her idea, her product, her money. - My name. - Your name? You remember Massa Walker? Nah. You was too young. When he would talk to us about the plantation, he'd always say "our field, our house." Turns out, that son of a bitch didn't free our asses until two years after the Civil War was over. What's your point, old man? What kind of self-respecting Negro works for his wife? I'm making twice as much now than I did back in St. Louis. Next thing you'll be wearin' a corset! Man needs something of his own. Especially a colored man. Never get your money where you get your honey. One of the great events in sports history. Heavyweight champion Jack Johnson will defend his crown against the man who is already a legend in his time. Former heavyweight champion James J. Jeffries. "Jack Johnson throws a thunderous left! Jeffries counters with a jab!" Mmm! This cake is good. When I told you to get some cake, I meant to pass out to the guests. "Jack Johnson moves in with a slug to the jaw! Jeffries is down!" Oh! Oh, come on. Come on, now. Don't fail me now! Black Jack is winning! - Oh, I can't... - Pop! - Blood pressure... - Oh, no! Oh! Oh, God. - Hurry up, CJ. What is it sayin'? - All right, hold on, man. Don't jam on me now! - What it say, CJ? - All right, here we go. "Jeffries is down. Will the White Hope rise?" No. The referee calls it. The fight is over. Black Jack Johnson won! It's our time now, baby! Oh, Peggie! Can you believe it? Sarah, you need to see this. Addie Munroe has moved here, and she's opening up a salon. Mama, where are you goin'? You don't have to worry about Addie! Your place is bigger. You got more products, more customers, more... Oh, no. You can't compete with that. "Oh, no" is right. Addie! As I live and breathe. Look who it is, Mama! Afternoon. How long you and Jean been in Indianapolis? Oh, I'm afraid that Jean's passed. So sorry for your loss. Yeah, you have our condolences. Thank you. It was quite unexpected, but I am ready for a fresh start. My salon in St. Louis is doing so well. I heard Indianapolis is booming and in dire need of a woman with my talents, so I figured, why not? How are you doing, Sarah? Haven't heard hide nor hair about your little company. I'm doin' good. Real good. In fact... Well, I best be getting back. You have a blessed day now, Addie. You see that? - The black eye? - Mm-hmm. I heard Jean used to beat her silly. He probably ain't dead. - ‹She just running. - Mm-hmm. Guess light-skin don't mean you gonna have a happy marriage. Mm-hmm. You know, all we women in the same boat. Please. She ain't as much as set a toe in our boat. Always gon' be easier for the likes of Addie. Soon as she open her salon, all my customers gonna flock to her. Don't say that. Gotta find a way to set myself apart. Riots in seven cities. I heard ten. Twenty-six Negroes killed. All because of Jack Johnson winnin' the fight. My, my, Gertrude. You look like a schoolgirl. That hair sure is growin'. I can't believe it. My hair ain't never reached my shoulders before. I see you, Annabelle. Lookin' good. Sarah Walker, you are royalty. We oughta call you Madam. Sarah Breedlove. How you doin', Addie? Oh, blessed and highly favored. Love that. So elegant. - ♪ I sing because I'm happy ♪ - ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ I sing because I'm free ♪ ♪ His eye is on the sparrow ♪ ♪ And I know that he watches me ♪ ♪ He watches me ♪ Please be seated. Can I get an amen? Amen. Ah, yes, indeed. Those that are new to Bethel AME, please rise and let us acknowledge your divine presence. What is she doin'? Where's she goin'? Ain't no one tell her to go up there. Thank y'all for welcoming me. I happen to need a fellowship. Amen. Just as Jesus has guided my path, and you have opened your doors to me, I would like to open the doors of my new salon to you. Addie's won't be no ordinary salon. No, Lord. Next week in the heart of downtown, I will open the first freestanding storefront, not in someone's kitchen, colored salon in all of Indiana. Thank you. I would like to take this time to acknowledge those that aren't with us... Babe. Those that weren't able to make it here today. Colored women will do anything to look like me... even if deep down, they know they can't. Now we've got a good arrangement here. Laundry for hair treatments. Let's not complicate things. These are my products. And I will not have the likes of you associated with them. Sarah, come on, open up, now. Girl, I see you in there. Come on. Open up. You'll fail soon enough. Two... And when you do... ...four... ...I got a hamper full of dirty laundry with your name on it. - What's goin' on, now? - Saints. - Sarah... - Can I have your attention, please? Can I have your attention? I just wanna share... the divine message God just sent me. Now so many of y'all in the congregation have flourished using my product. Which is why the good Lord... oh, is he ever so good... Yes, he is. ...gave me the vision to lower the price of my Hair Grower as a thank you. Buy one, get one free. Can I get an amen? Amen! I'll be taking orders in the front of the church. First five ladies get free hair stylin', tell all your friends. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you. It's gonna take us months to fill these orders. We ain't got enough workers, or storage, or equipment. This is a house, baby. It ain't a damn factory. We can do it, CJ. We are doin' it! ♪ Gotta work ♪ ♪ To get by Gotta work ♪ - ♪ To get by ♪ - ♪ Gotta work ♪ ♪ To get by Gotta work ♪ ♪ Till I can't work no more ♪ ♪ No more ♪ ♪ No more ♪ ♪ No more ♪ ♪ Huh ♪ It's doin' good. What was that? Everybody out! Come on! - Go! - There's a fire! - Where's John at? - I don't know. It was his shift. No! I'll get him. Y'all, go on out! I got it! Hey, what's goin' on? - Did you leave the product burning? - I just stepped outside to smoke. This is all your f... Mama! Right here. Hurry up, now! Can you pump it any quicker? All right, keep it goin'. I never should've let her get to me. I should've kept my eye on the sparrow. It's okay, baby. It's okay. How we gonna eat? - Where we gonna sleep? - We gonna figure it out. Get a job at the hotel if we have to. We'll figure it out. Come on, now, hurry up! But if you need a place to go, then, you know where to come, until Sarah gets back on her feet. You know, let's hope she does that. I'm right here for you in the meantime. Okay, ladies? That's very important that you have somewhere to get your hair done. Sarah, I am so sorry. I came as soon as I could. You are so brave. Please. Save the crocodile tears. You know you came to gloat. You're upset, so I won't take that personally. Uh, I just came to offer my services, free of charge, to all of your clients. You ain't comin' up here stealin' my customers. Well, I would never steal. You had your foot on my throat for years. Told me I was worthless, useless, too dark to shine. But the mere inkling that I might be doin' well made you move over a thousand miles, clear across country, just to dim my light. You are out of your mind. Find yourself a new whipping post 'cause them days is over for me. In fact, take a seat. 'Cause I'm about to replace all this with a factory. And leave you in the dust. - Sarah... - No, no, no, no, no. You want to speak to me?
