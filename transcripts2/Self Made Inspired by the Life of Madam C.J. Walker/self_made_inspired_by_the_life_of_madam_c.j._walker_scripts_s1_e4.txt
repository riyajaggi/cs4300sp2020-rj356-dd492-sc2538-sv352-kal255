 Famed Negro beauty culturist Madam CJ Walker is America's first self-made female millionaire, establishing the Madam CJ Walker Manufacturing Company a mere two years ago. Wonderful Hair Grower put Madam Walker on the map, but her pressing oil, Glossine, and hot comb kit made her a household name, with salons and sales agents across the country. And now, her daughter Lelia is following in her footsteps, opening a salon known as the Dark Tower in the heart of Harlem. Time for a toast. To Sarah.

 Congratulations on officially moving to New York. Mm-hmm. Why, thank you, Dr. Du Bois. And to my beautiful daughter Lelia, for being so gracious and putting me up in Harlem while they finish my new estate. And for creating such a beautiful salon. May The Dark Tower be your legacy. - Dinner is served. - Mmm. Please follow me to the residency. I'm so excited to see what Lelia has done with this magnificent house. I hear they have a greenhouse. - More champagne? - Oh. Don't mind if I do.

 Read the story on you in The New York Times. Must feel pretty great to be Madam CJ Walker right now. I feel like I'm living a dream. Madam? Madam, are you all right? Sarah! Sarah. Madam, are you all right? Sarah, come home. Sarah. Sarah. Are you listening? I want you on a strict vegetarian diet. And you'll need to take a sabbatical from working for at least a year. Mm-mmm. This is serious. How bad is it? Well, according to your test, your kidneys are failing, and there is no cure. You're dying. Madam? It's Mr. Ransom and Lelia here with you. Mama, are you okay? What'd the doctor say? Oh. Too much champagne, and... my blood pressure's a little high, but other than that, I'm... ...fine. Well, uh... you had us worried. I just got the best idea. I want to have a convention. I want to bring all my employees together, all 10,000 of them, together under one roof. What do y'all think? Well, that, uh, that sounds interesting, but, uh, we can talk about it tomorrow. - Let's get you home. - Oh... I want it to be big. Bigger than the National Negro Business League Convention. Bigger... than the Teamsters. And I want to have panels and... and lectures and a formal gala. Mama, slow down. Ten thousand employees. That ain't just big, that's a small army. Mm-hmm. An army. I like that. I like that. An army. - ♪ Oh ♪ - ♪ How about if you ♪ ♪ Take flight and reach my altitude? ♪ ♪ There'll be no need for the floor ♪ We were there. - Oh, it was nice. - Ladies. - Oh, I loved it. - Really? Here. To celebrate the show tonight. - Cheers. - Cheers. To a wonderful opening. I think you should really come back more often. Exactly which songs are you guys going to be singing tonight? What's going on? Come on. Is this a party or a place of business? If you're not working here, or a paying customer, get out. - Get out! - Mama. You remember the Whitman Sisters? They're opening at the Lafayette Theater tonight. Oh. They bought out the salon to get ready. Yes, of course. My apologies. I'm a big fan. I caught your act in Chicago. Well, welcome, ladies. Carry on. I'm just gonna.. ...borrow my daughter. Mama, what are you doing out of bed? You should be resting. A little warning would have been nice. Now, Ransom found a venue for my convention, so you and me need to go over there and make a plan. Now? Can't we do that later? I have important clients. I don't have time for "later," gal. You gotta strike while the iron's hot. And we need to go out and get you some new dresses. This is all the rage in Paris. You're never gonna catch a decent husband dressed like that. - Mama... - I want grandbabies. It's been years since you divorced John. The only men that are interested in me are after my money. Okay, your money. Well, now that I'm living in New York, I can help. I'll make a list of acceptable men, and you'll have a new beau on your arm by the convention. Sarah Walker. You can run, but you can't hide. I'm busy. I don't have time for your nonsense anymore, CJ. You the one that wanted the divorce. Now sign the damn papers! - Don't barge in making demands. - You haven't changed. You still as selfish as ever. Ain't nothing more selfish than a man cheating on his wife. Oh, and I heard your little girlfriend Dora has been running around trying to pass herself off as Madam CJ Walker. - You thought I wouldn't find out? - It's my name. I can do whatever I damn well please with it. No, no, no. Madam CJ Walker is my name! I worked like a dog to build it. Now I'm not signing anything until I get some assurances that you and Dora won't put any products out using my name. It's been two years. Stop toying with me, Sarah. Sign the damn papers! Harrison will show you out. - Harrison... - Harrison? I ain't leaving New York until you sign on the dotted line. Now, I'm gonna be at the Marshall Hotel under my name... Charles Joseph Walker! On your tab, woman. Don't... Don't touch me. This one's head is just way too big. No, not that one. This one look like his mama still dress him. Is your mama Mata Hari or something? How she find these men? And with photos too? Beats me. All I know is Mama ain't been right ever since she fainted. Doesn't she see you have more to offer than making babies? We're still moving to Paris. Mama just got spooked in the hospital. Once she move out and get busy with the convention... she'll forget all about me. I'm not so sure. We have to make sure she focuses on something other than you. What's something she's always wanted? Long hair all the way to her fanny, a koala bear, and a trip to the moon. No. I meant for her business. A few years back, she was this close to getting Glossine into the 10 Cents and Less store. But drunk old CJ messed that deal up. I know Henrietta Saunders. Her daddy owns the Saunders Drugstore chain. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Well, call up Henrietta and see if she wants to come out with us tonight. Mmm. She had the nerve to kick me out of my house. I mean, it's my house till the divorce, right? Why won't she just sign the papers? What does she w... What does she want? I wish I knew. I know I'm running up her tab something awful, I know that much. Maybe she's still in love with you. Or thinks you're still in love with her. I told you. You my Walker Girl now. You told me I'd be Madam CJ Walker by now. We making good money with Addie. We? I don't see you punching a clock. You know what I mean. I don't want to work for Addie. I'm a star too, you know. I'll stay here as long as it takes. Wear Sarah down. No. We need a new plan to get rid of her. I've heard some interesting things about Sarah and Addie Munroe. I know you got some dirt. Spill it. Ugh... Would you mind concentrating on the work in the back of the house? I'd like to set up something in the garden. Yes, ma'am. Mama? Mama? Oh. There you are. Mmm. Good morning. How was your date with Dr. Hanover? Great. He had to deliver twins and never showed up. Dr. Hanover is one of the most eligible bachelors in Harlem. I hope you rescheduled. Well, I was so busy trying to get in with Saunders Drugstore, I must have forgot. It says the board wants to meet to talk about getting Walker products in their stores. How on Earth did you pull this off? Let's just say I know people in high places. I've been trying to make a deal like this for years. We should do something special for the presentation. New ads just for Saunders. Maybe a photo shoot in your garden? Lelia Walker, you just might have a knack for business after all. Oh. Look at that. Hello. You must be the model. - What's your name, darling? - Fairy Mae Bryant. Fairy Mae, you have the most gorgeous hair I've ever seen. I like your hair, too. And your house. Well, thank you. It's so pretty. - You live next door to Rockefeller? - Yes. I've never met him, but I want to. I'd ask him to let me into that school they named after his wife. - What do you know about Spelman College? - I don't know. Just heard it's the best college for colored gals, is all. Mm-hmm. I wanted Miss Lelia to go there, but she wasn't interested. I'll take her place. I like your gumption. Fairy. Go inside, honey. They're ready to do your hair. Oh! - Isn't she the cat's meow? - Where on Earth did you find her? Sweeping up at the salon. Her family fell upon hard times. Her father died, and... left her mother with seven children, the youngest still nursing. So I thought it'd be nice to take her under my wing. Well, find out what they need and let me know. I could use a little helper. Be nice to have a child around the house for a change. Sarah? Sarah? We're having trouble finding a venue for the convention. Now, if we had a smaller affair, maybe just the top agents... What if I had the convention here? It's almost finished. You're joking, right? It's my land. I own it. I can do whatever I want. Madam, you are the first Negro to move into this neighborhood. Now what do you think your neighbors would do when they see hundreds of our people storming their town? - I don't care... - Care, right. I know. That's what you pay me to do. I would be remiss if I didn't voice serious concern. It's dangerous. Now, suppose the police come... with dogs. Or worse. I've made up my mind. I have to do this now. Miss Sarah? There's a lady yelling on the phone for you. Sounds like the name Maddie? Thank you, baby. Hello? I knew it in my bones, Sarah Breedlove. You stole my formula, and now I got proof. Who is this? You know damn well who this is. I'm sorry, you have the wrong number. Don't you dare hang up on me. Your husband's fiancée gave me quite an earful. Told me that your Hair Grower is practically the same as mine. - Nonsense. - I'm taking it straight to a chemist, and me and my lawyer are gonna shut you down. You are finished, Sarah. What is it? Addie Munroe... has had it out for me for years. Lord have mercy. What is it this time? She's accusing me of stealing her formula. - Can you believe? - I'll handle it. Let me make some calls. CJ... My apologies. My daughter is usually very punctual. Glossine is for the youth. Glossine is for the people. Glossine is the future! Gentlemen, my daughter can be a little out there. Sometimes. Cut it. What, uh, Lelia was trying to demonstrate is all women dream of having hair like this. Which can be achieved with the help of the Walker hair care system. My people are moving out of the South in droves now. More colored women are getting professional jobs than ever. And we want to look sophisticated and urban. And that's why I want my product in your stores. - Now let me tell you about the product. - No need. Your impeccable reputation precedes you. We've read all about you in The New York Times, Madam Walker. And Saunders Drugs... wants to be in business with you. Oh, thank you, Mr. Saunders. Thank all of you. Ransom? You did it, Miss Sarah. - Believe it. - Amen. I'm gonna be a millionaire. We need to celebrate. Mmm. Addie... knows I stole her formula. It was you, right? You told Dora. I had to find a way to level the playing field. You were supposed to take that secret to the grave. I was running out of options. This is my reputation you're toying with. I know that don't mean much to you, but it's everything to me. For years... I hated being known as "Mr. Madam CJ Walker." Turns out not being your husband is much worse. Hmm. Well, you certainly got your vengeance, didn't you? Found yourself a nice high-yellow grifter to embarrass me with. And now you destroy my legacy? You betrayed me with the company and tossed me away like a rag. If you had kept your thing in your pants... You had my thing in a vise grip for years. How am I supposed to compete with the whole damn company? I would have put up with anything, CJ. Anything... except her. You knew it. You knew it, and you did it anyway. Sarah, don't. I made one... I made one mistake. One mistake, and that's... that's... loving you more than anything. And you broke me. You broke me. You broke me. I love you. CJ. Oh, CJ. Oh. Oh. Sarah? Sarah? Hey. Hey. Don't leave. I, uh... I need to think. Okay, I gotta go. I have to get up early tomorrow. Come on. One more drink. I've barely seen you since the Saunders deal went through. Let's at least celebrate it. Please. We can celebrate tomorrow. Let's celebrate in Paris. Peaches, I already told you. I can't just run off to Paris right now. Let me guess, because of your mom? I'm sick of your excuses, Lelia. I just don't believe you anymore. I don't need Paris. I need you. Lelia Walker! - Mama. - What in God's name are you doing? - It's not what you think. - Yes, it is. Tell her the truth. Tell her. Let's go. Just wait for me, please. Whatever this is, it stops now. You find a husband, and you start a family. No! I cannot do it. I won't. I tried. - Nothing is ever good enough for you. - All I want is an heir. What about what I want? Huh? That's your dream, it's not mine. I can't live your life. You have to! You don't have a choice! Can't you see I'm dying? The doctor says I don't have a lot of time. Kidney disease. Now you gonna have to be strong, baby. Keep the company going. And you need a family. Who's gonna look after you when I'm gone? Mama, no... I built all this wealth to pass down to you. To leave a legacy. But if you don't have any children, what's it all for? Now I need you to promise me that you're gonna settle down. Look at me. You promise me that you're gonna settle down? I promise. Okay. I'm just gonna put one more coat on it. All right. Ransom, I was thinking... the first shipment to Saunders should... Ransom? What is it? Ransom? What's wrong? Colored man can't even take his boy for ice cream without harm coming his way. Did something happen? Sweetness was looking in on my family, helping Nettie while I've been here. Took my boy Willard to the ice cream shop. Some older boys... white boys, bumped into him, knocked over his cone. Sweetness told them to apologize. Didn't mince words. Their fathers didn't like some flashy, uppity nigger talking to their sons that way. I'm sorry, Ransom. Willard? The owner of the shop, he hid him. Thank God. Spent my entire life ashamed of Sweetness. Too flashy, too loud... too angry. Brilliant man. Real head for figures. If he were white, he'd have been the head of a bank or a corporation or something. And he died for... He died fighting for my son! I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. Come on. I'll help you pack. - What about your convention? - No. - What about the work that we... - We're going to Sweetness's funeral. Lelia will finish the preparations. Let's get you home. My condolences. Oh, Sweetness. Sarah. My lawyer is looking into pressing charges against you. I bet Saunders Pharmacies doesn't want that kind of attention either. Oh. Congratulations on your little deal. Jealousy is an ugly color on you. No, no. I'm not jealous. Tired... of folks underestimating me as just another light bright. Done with being taken advantage of. So instead, you want to be remembered as a villain who shut down Madam Walker's company. The woman who took thousands of jobs away from hard-working folk. I wish I had never knocked on your door that day, Sarah Breedlove. What do you want from me, Addie? Hmm? You want me to tell the world that I stole your formula? Is that what you want? Excuse me, ma'am. Did you know that Madam CJ stole Miracle Hair Grower from Addie Munroe? You think you can just swan in here and steal my work and all the glory that comes with it? I can admit I stole your formula. But you need to admit that I made it better. I worked hard on that formula. And my success made you work harder. You stole from me, and you lied about it for years. I wanted us to work together! I begged you! No. But you didn't want me. I would have done anything to be in business with you, Addie. Anything. You do work miracles with hair. We could have been a great team, the two of us. Think of all the money we could have made, all the folks we could have helped if we had done it together. Life is short, Addie. Let it go. White folks out here killing us. We have got to stop fighting over things that don't matter. All aboard! All points south. All aboard. You sure you don't need me to come to the convention? Your family needs you more. I've signed the divorce papers. Can you make sure CJ gets a copy? I'll personally deliver it. I don't want him or Dora to get my company... if something happened. I'm sure you know about my health. Lelia never could keep a secret. You shouldn't be having a convention. I've slowed down. No, you haven't. I've watched you. This is serious. I can't afford to lose you too. Oh. We're all gonna die, Freeman. I can't control that. But I can control... how I'm remembered, what I leave behind. No one will ever forget you, Madam. I'll make sure of it. I'm gonna hold you to that. ♪ Been called an angel and the devil Since the dawn of time ♪ ♪ Been called a sweetheart And the apple of your eye ♪ ♪ Been called a vixen and a tramp And everything between ♪ ♪ Been called all kinda of things Never what I seem ♪ ♪ But you can call me queen ♪ ♪ But you can call me queen ♪ Oh.

In a few years, it will make the Walker Manufacturing Company bigger and even more accessible. What about us? You selling your products in stores makes us obsolete. - Right, ladies? - Yeah! I'm prepared to offer you a large percentage of the profits in a year. I need to put food on the table tonight! Who says you'll still have sales agents in a year? I give you my word. I will. You want our trust? - Drop your deal with Saunders. - Yes. - Or we quit! - We quit! That's right. - Wait a minute. - No more waiting.

He had a scrunchy little finger. So I just, you know, put a little splint on it and then I kind of wrapped it up. He was bleeding so much. Oh. Lelia. There you are. Been looking all over for you. Family emergency. Pardon me; I need my daughter. It's gonna take all day and all night, so you may as well go on home, honey. First, you push George on me. Then you drag me away? I know. I know. You just look... so... unhappy. Seeing you with him just about broke my heart. You've always been different. Always gonna be. So from now on, I'm backing off. No more dates. I want you to live your life the way you want. The point of this convention, the point of the company is to give women like us choices. Freedom. I've always just wanted to make you proud. Oh, darling. I am proud of you. You've done a great job with the Harlem salon, and I know I don't say that enough. Lelia, you... you are my legacy. My most precious gift. The beauty of my whole world. And I always love you. Always. I have a surprise for you. Mama, you were right. We do need an heir. And I do want to continue your legacy, and I can't do it alone. But I found someone who needed a little uplifting. Take a look. Fairy? What are you two up to? Fairy Mae already feels like family. So I talked to Fairy Mae's mother and convinced her to let her live with us. But... I promised we'd try to get her into Spelman. Oh. Hey, baby. My girls. Come here. Oh. My girls. Ladies... you are all so much more than employees to me. It's why I had this convention, why I invited you to my home. I may have dreamed Walker Manufacturing, but you... made it a reality. Yes, we did. All I've ever wanted was to help colored women. Precious few of us ever get to reach our destinies. We are dismissed, undermined, ignored, stepped over, beaten, or even worse, lynched. That's true. And that is why I have decided to pull out of the Saunders Drugstore deal. Yes. Yes, I don't need a chain store to grow my business. - I have you! - Yes! Warriors! Yes! An army of strong, powerful women. Stand with me. Stand with me, and I vow to help each and every one of you take control of your lives. - Yes. - Take control of your destinies! Yes, ma'am. Stand with me. Yes! Yes! Yes! - Yes, we will! - Yes! Ooh! Everybody looks so lovely tonight. - Cheers. - Cheers. Beautiful. I'm so glad you did this, Mama. Mmm. I'm glad I got to see it. How did you ever come up with all this, Miss Sarah? Sisters! Let's talk about hair! My name is Lelia, and this is my mama. We have a product here that I'm sure will change your life. Female enterprise is good for us all. It's the way of the future. I can see it clear as day. If you become a Walker sales agent, you'll have a better job and more money. Madam CJ Walker will make sure all your dreams come true. I don't know how I dreamt it, but I wasn't gonna let anything stop me. Look what I dreamed up! I started selling door-to-door. I became a hairdresser. Secretary. Factory forewoman. I went to Lelia College, then I opened my own salon. By the 1930s, I had worked for the Walker Company for over 20 years. In the 1950s, I supervised a dozen Walker beauty schools. I was a Madam CJ Walker national sales agent in the 1970s. ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ This is what I do ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ I'm the living proof ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ This is what I do ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ Comin' with the truth ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ This is what I do ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ I'm the living proof ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ This is what I do ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ Comin' with the truth ♪ ♪ Path, I make wrath ♪ ♪ I make sure this blast I break glass ♪ ♪ I make sure this lasts It's all math ♪ ♪ I make sure this pass I make class ♪ ♪ I make sure that you know You better know ♪ ♪ I got pedal to the floor I make row ♪ ♪ It's all water into wine As he rhyme ♪ ♪ I make it's all mine A gold mine ♪ ♪ I stay on good track, can't fall back You see, this all patience ♪ ♪ Ain't no contract, I'm free stacks I'm out of The Matrix ♪ ♪ And you know that you set back With no paid vacation ♪ ♪ And you hate that you love that But can't change the station ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ This is what I do ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ I'm the living proof ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ This is what I do ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ Comin' with the truth ♪ ♪ Every time heavyweight champ In this mother, sucker ♪ ♪ 'Cause you don't hear no lies In this energy I'm giving, brother ♪ ♪ I don't waste no time This is legacy, in truth, mother ♪ ♪ Passin' down the tithes, this is church When you hear me, sucker ♪ ♪ Every time heavyweight champ In this mother, sucker ♪ ♪ You don't hear no lies In this energy I'm giving, brother ♪ ♪ I don't waste no time This is legacy, in truth, mother ♪ ♪ Passin' down the tithes, this is church When you hear me, sucker ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ This is what I do ♪ ♪ This is who I am ♪ ♪ This is who I am This is who I am ♪ ♪ Comin' with the truth ♪
