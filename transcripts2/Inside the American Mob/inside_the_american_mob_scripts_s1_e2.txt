And those mobsters had power in those days. If they gave you an assignment you couldn't refuse and you had to do it. Francis Lewis Boulevard. Walk into the bank, real quiet.

 Hit the floor! [screams]. Salvatore Polsi: I run into the bank and vault right over the top of the counter. And yell, "Back up!" And all the tellers back up. And I go into each drawer and start scooping the money out. My favorite trademark was to carry a bag with me, I'd have two bags in my pockets and they would be little plastic bags and it said, "I Love New York." I noticed every head teller would have a key chain with keys. And I said to the head teller,

 "Into the vault!" "Let's go, into the vault. Right now, go!" And she hesitated and she began to urinate on the floor right in front of me. Now I kind of felt bad that I made her do that, but I, I don't have time for this, "To the vault!" She went to the vault, she opened up the door, she opened up a couple of drawers, grabbed a whole bunch of stacks of money. We got into the car, we got back to the safe house and we dumped all the money on the bed. That was like one of the fun moments, dumping the money on the bed. So I always robbed the banks with the same bag, "I Love New York," bag. Eventually when I got busted they had reports and they said, "We know how many banks you did, you always carried that little white bag," you know. It was a trademark of a criminal! I just couldn't get away from it, you know! NARRATOR: IT'S 1978  AND THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT IS AT WAR  WITH A HIDDEN EMPIRE. Newswoman: Mob warfare is on the rise all across the streets of New York City. In Brooklyn, a low-level mobster is shot dead in broad daylight. NARRATOR: A NETWORK  OF GANGSTERS WHO LiVE BY A CODE OF CRIME,  VIOLENCE AND POWER. IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS  STRUGGLE ARE TWO MEN, MICHAEL FRANZESE,  A MADE MAN IN THE COLOMBO CRIME FAMILY;  THE OTHER JOE PISTONE, AN UNDERCOVER FBI AGENT,  BOTH TRYING TO CLIMB THE LADDER AND SURVIVE  IN THE AMERICAN MOB. THEY, ALONG WITH THEIR  COMPATRIOTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LAW, ARE WITNESSES  TO THIS SECRET HISTORY, STEPPING FORWARD  NOW TO TELL THEIR STORIES FIRST HAND. A FEW STAY IN THE SHADOWS  FOR REASONS OF PERSONAL SAFETY, FEARING A CRIMINAL  ORGANIZATION THAT REIGNED UNCHALLENGED IN THE UNITED  STATES UNTIL RECENT TIMES. AND IN THE 1970S  THEY WERE UNTOUCHABLE. John Marks: What was the view on organized crime when you joined the Bureau? Steve Salmieri: Back then it was a very closed society. Organized crime knew what police could or couldn't do. Jim Walden: There were crews within families that were literally untouched, uh, by law enforcement for decades. NARRATOR: IN 1978,  FIVE CRIME FAMILIES RULE NEW YORK CITY  AND THROUGH IT, MOST OF THE COUNTRY. THE FAMILIES GO BY THE  NAMES OF THEIR BEST KNOWN LEADERS: GAMBINO,  COLOMBO, BONANNO, GENOVESE AND LUCCHESE. RIGHT IN THEIR MIDST  HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT IS AN UNDERCOVER  AGENT NAMED JOE PISTONE. HE'S BEEN LIVING AMONG  THE COLOMBO FAMILY FOR THE LAST YEAR UNDER  THE ALIAS DONNIE BRASCO. Joe Pistone: When I first started, the FBI didn't think there was a mafia. [laughs]. NARRATOR: PISTONE LEAVES  THE COLOMBO FAMILY LOOKING FOR A DEEPER WAY INTO THE  AMERICAN MOB AND NOW HE'S GOT A SHOT AT  INFILTRATING ANOTHER OF THE FIVE FAMILIES,  THE BONANNOS. Edward McDonald: The Bonanno family controlled gambling and loansharking back in the day but those days were over and they had to find other ways of making money. Jim Walden: The Bonanno family can be fairly characterized as ground breakers when it came to drug trafficking. Fat Sal Colombo: They would smoke drugs, rob drug dealers and they were wild guys. Jim Walden: The Bonanno's were really, at this period of time, the worst. NARRATOR: NOW FOR THE  FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, THANKS TO A SINGLE  UNDERCOVER AGENT, THE FBI HAS A  SHOT AT TAKING DOWN AN ENTIRE FAMILY. Joseph Coffey: Joe Pistone was an FBI agent who was pretty effective as an undercover. And he was recruited by the FBI to get into the Bonanno family, which he did by going to a going to a guy named Lefty Guns Ruggiero. Joe Pistone: Lefty was a, a 24/7 gangster. He grew up in the life. He had relatives that were in the life. He was a tough guy to be around. Selwyn Raab: If you were in Joe Pistone's shoes, you had to know that every second that you were dealing with these mafia guys might be your last moment on earth. One mistake, the slightest error, you're through. They never hesitate to kill. Joe Pistone: When you're with these guys you have to blend in. They have to, you have to be believable. James Kossler: He had convinced them that he was a very adequate and very good jewel thief. Joe Pistone: I would bring around some diamonds, I'd bring around watches you know, all stuff that was confiscated by the federal government. After a while, Lefty really becomes comfortable with me. And he'd be telling me about who's the boss of this family, the boss of that family. I'm gathering great intelligence information. He's like an encyclopedia of the mob. Rudolph Giuliani: Law enforcement work requires infiltration. You cannot do all of it through wiretaps. You can't do all of it through, uh, through telephone intercepts. You can't do all of it through bugs. Because you don't know what to wiretap. Lefty Ruggiero: What happened last night? Donnie Brasco: What? I called, you weren't out there. I talked to Sonny. I called the house, nobody answered. Lefty Ruggiero: Let me tell you something, Donnie, the man never told me nothing. He's playing games with me. He knows that I'm. Selwyn Raab: It's a real goldmine for the FBI. Now they have an agent who is really in the middle of a mafia family. NARRATOR:  SOON PISTONE, UNDER THE ALIAS  DONNIE BRASCO AND RUGGIERO HATCH  A SCHEME TOGETHER. Joe Pistone: Lefty always said he was interested in expanding out of New York. NARRATOR:  FORTUNATELY, THE FBI'S ALREADY GOT  A GREAT FRONT. AN UNDERCOVER  OPERATION IN A FLORIDA NIGHTCLUB CALLED  THE KING'S COURT. Joe Pistone: So we had a night club going in Florida and because he knew that I was the kind of guy that could be trusted, he put me in charge there. NARRATOR: ANOTHER FBI  AGENT, STEVE SALMIERI, IS ALREADY WORKING  UNDERCOVER IN THE CLUB. Steve Salmieri: The club was set up because this was a venue they could have and they could see that the money could be made. So Joe came down and, uh, you know, it really solidified him with the Bonanno family. NARRATOR: THAT NIGHT  CLUB BECOMES THE BAIT THAT LURES LEFTY AND  THE BONANNOS INTO A TRAP. Joe Pistone: Our operation was confined to a very limited number of individuals. So agents would be taking photographs, they're taking pictures you know, on surveillance and I'm on a lot of the surveillance and the agents didn't know Donnie Brasco was really an FBI agent. NARRATOR: OPERATION  DONNIE BRASCO IS GARNERING RESULTS IN FLORIDA. BUT BACK IN NEW YORK A  MAFIA POWER STRUGGLE IS ABOUT TO CHANGE  THE GAME DRAMATICALLY FOR JOE PISTONE. THE PROBLEM: AN  AMBITIOUS BONANNO BOSS NAMED CARMINE GALANTE. News Reporter: Galante looked more like a grandfather than a godfather as he walked his dog each morning in Greenwich Village. But his real interests embrace gambling, prostitution, loansharking and most of all, heroin and other drugs. Edward McDonald: Carmine Galante, who got out of prison after a long prison sentence for narcotics trafficking tried to muscle in and take control over the Bonanno crime family. Joe Pistone: He controlled all the importation of drugs into the US. And Galante wouldn't share any of this with any of the other families. NARRATOR: SHARING IS  A GOLDEN RULE AMONG THE MAFIA'S FIVE FAMILIES  AND BOSSES WHO DON'T SHARE GET IN TROUBLE  WITH THE COMMISSION, THE GOVERNING BOARD OF  THE MAFIA WHICH HOLDS THE POWER OF LIFE AND DEATH  OVER ALL OTHER MOBSTERS, INCLUDING UPSTART BOSSES. Joe Pistone: So the other families got together and they decided he's got to go. He's gotta go. Michael Chertoff: Carmine Galante, he's a regular patron at a restaurant in Brooklyn called Joe and Mary's Restaurant. And he goes sit out in the in the patio in the back with his bodyguards. Joseph Coffey: It was August, hot summer day. Just sitting there, he's having pasta with his friends, they're holding a conversation. Michael Chertoff: Car pulls up in front of the restaurant and there are four people in the car. One is the driver who stays with the car. The other three go through the restaurant, they know exactly where Galante's gonna be. Joseph Coffey: He sits there, puts a cigar in his mouth. Michael Chertoff: They walk into the patio. [gunshots] Joseph Coffey: They blow him over the chair into the tomato patch. News Reporter: Galante was having lunch in the courtyard of an Italian restaurant in Brooklyn when 5 men entered with automatic rifles and shotguns and opened fire. Reporter: Did your uncle say who he was gonna eat lunch with today? Man: No, no, he stopped every day for coffee. Reporter: He stopped in here every day? Man: He don't know nothing. Joseph Coffey: When I get there they body's still there because I get there pretty quick and there's one laying in the tomato patch with a cigar in his mouth and a Zippo lighter in his hand. I look at it, it's Carmine Galante. It was an iconic picture because it went all over the world. My friends in Washington said Joe Coffey put that cigar in his mouth 'cause they, you know, I had a sense of humor, so did he and of course I didn't do it but I let everybody think I did. NARRATOR: DOWN IN  FLORIDA JOE PISTONE GETS A CALL FROM NEW YORK. Joe Pistone: I was in Florida looking out after the club down there and I called Lefty because I had to call him every day. He says, "Have you seen the New York papers?" And I said I haven't seen 'em yet. He said, "Well go buy the New York papers then call me back." I buy the New York paper and there's the picture. I knew from Lefty that Galante didn't have a lot of admirers, but I never had any indication that they were gonna kill him. So I call him back and I said I got the paper, he said, "You read it?" I said, "Yeah." He said, "Well things are gonna change." "They killed Galante, they want you to come back to New York." NARRATOR:  GALANTE'S EXECUTION SHAKES UP THE  BONANNO FAMILY. IN THE UNSTABLE NEW ORDER,  IMPRISONED MOBSTER NAMED RUSTY RASTELLI BECOMES  THE BOSS AND A HARD CASE NAMED SONNY  BLACK BECOMES A CAPTAIN. LEFTY GETS REASSIGNED  TO WORK UNDER SONNY BLACK AND ALONG FOR THE  RIDE IS DONNIE BRASCO. Selwyn Raab: Pistone is a godsend. He's more than just a wannabe. He's got Lefty Ruggiero on his side who's bringing him in to meet Capos like Sonny Black Napolitano. Joe Pistone: Sonny Black was a tough guy, but you can joke with him. Plus he wanted to keep earning money and the undercover operation we had in Florida, he made a lot of money. NARRATOR: PISTONE NOW  GETS CLOSE TO SONNY BLACK, WHO'S FORTUNES IN THE  BONANNO FAMILY ARE RISING, THANKS IN PART  TO THE FLORIDA CLUB. Selwyn Raab: He's inside a capo's counsel! A capo is talking to him, dealing with him, telling him secrets. He's at third base. Joe Pistone: I like Sonny Black. I mean, how could you have comfortable conversation with him, uh, if you really don't like him? You know, I used to spend a lot of time with him and I used to sleep at his apartment. I can remember telling this story my FBI superiors and they couldn't believe it. I mean, you know, he slept in the bedroom, I slept on his couch, we'd get up in the morning and we'd sit around in our underwear. And here's me, an undercover FBI agent and one of the most powerful captains of the Bonanno family sitting there drinking coffee, having a hard roll with butter and watching cartoons on television. You never see that in the movies. NARRATOR: BUT  THAT FRIENDSHIP WITH SONNY BLACK IS  ABOUT TO LEAD PISTONE STRAIGHT TO  COLD BLOODED MURDER. Both: [laughing]. NARRATOR: BY 1979,  FBI UNDERCOVER AGENT JOE PISTONE HAS  ACHIEVED SOMETHING NO FED HAD EVER DONE,  PENETRATING ONE OF THE MOB'S MOST  NOTORIOUS FAMILIES, THE BONANNO FAMILY. THE KEY TO HIS SUCCESS,  A POWERFUL BONANNO CAPTAIN NAMED SONNY BLACK. Joe Pistone: The relationship with Sonny really propelled the operation. Because Sonny really becomes comfortable with me. Sonny and Lefty would have conversations and not cut me out. They'd tell me about what's going on. Edward McDonald: After the execution of Carmine Galante, three capos of the Bonanno crime family tried to muscle in and take control over the family. Selwyn Raab: And it's open warfare. They're looking to kill each other. Joe Pistone: Three captains wanted to take over the family. Sonny "Red" Indelicato, Phil "Lucky" Giaccone and Dominick Trinchera. Sonny Black and uh, Joey Massino call a sit down to iron out their differences. NARRATOR: BUT THERE  IS NO IRONING OUT THESE DIFFERENCES. IT'S ALL ABOUT POWER. Edward McDonald: What was supposed to be a sit down, was a trap, an ambush. Joe Massino was there. He tackles, uh, Sonny "Red" Indelicato. Shoots him in the head. The other two capos are also killed. NARRATOR: THE THREE  RENEGADE CAPOS ARE DEAD, BUT THERE'S  A LOOSE END. Steve Salmieri: Sonny's crew killed Sonny Red and that pissed people. So they were looking to kill each other and Joe's in the middle. NARRATOR: WHAT FOLLOWS  IS A CONVERSATION THAT NO FBI AGENT  HAS EVER HAD BEFORE, PROOF POSITIVE  THAT JOE PISTONE HAS PULLED  OFF ONE OF THE GREATEST DECEPTIONS IN  LAW ENFORCEMENT HISTORY, SONNY BLACK INVITES  HIM TO JOIN THE CLUB. Joe Pistone: Sonny tells me, you know, "I already proposed you for membership in the family." "You're gonna get made in December." He tells me, you know, "We took care of those guys." He said, "One got away." And I said "Who?" He says, "Bruno Indelicato." He said, "I'm giving you the contract to get Bruno Indelicato." Now, as an FBI agent, you can't get involved in acts of violence, unless you're protecting yourself or protecting a citizen. And one of the rules in mafia is that when you get a contract, if you turn it down you're gonna get killed. So, when I was told, "You got the contract to kill Bruno Indelicato," I said, "Okay, Sonny, where do you think he is?" Sonny Black: Come on, take a walk. NARRATOR: THE HUNT IS  ON FOR BRUNO INDELICATO. IF PISTONE  FINDS AND KILLS HIM, HE'S GOING TO  BECOME A MADE MAN, EARNING HIS PLACE IN THE  BONANNO FAMILY WITH BLOOD. BUT OVER IN  THE COLOMBO FAMILY, MICHAEL FRANZESE  IS EARNING HIS PLACE WITH COLD HARD CASH. John Marks: Did you ever have a nickname? Michael Franzese: You know, not till later on when the media tagged me as being the Yuppie Don, which I hated. But, uh, nobody would call me that to my face. I tell 'em, "Don't ever say that to me, I don't like it," you know? It reminded me of California and all these kind of weird guys out there in suits. Selwyn Raab: Michael Franzese was an immense earner for the Colombo family. And a guy who knew how to really deal with modern day capitalism. He was a new breed. Michael Franzese: All right, fellas, let's go. Reporter: This handsome, young mafia prince from New York is Michael Franzese, son of legendary mafia godfather. Edward McDonald: Michael Franzese's father was Sonny Franzese. He was a legendary figure in the world of organized crime, very powerful figure in the Colombo crime family. Michael Franzese: You know, my dad he just had that presence about him that people just really treated him well. And that's, you know, for a young guy looking up to your father that's who I want to emulate. That's how I want to be in my life. NARRATOR: AND ONE WAY  FRANZESE HOPES TO MAKE MONEY IS CLASSIC MOB:  THROUGH THE LABOR UNIONS. Michael Franzese: I had some very lucrative situations with unions. One of them, in a, a major contracting construction job with a major developer in, um, in Queens. And this is a major job, it was the biggest co-op conversion in the country at that time. And one of the guys in there, uh, happened to be the brother of a girl that I was dating at one time. And he got in touch with me and he said, "Mike, I've got this job," and he said, "The union is really harping on us," he said, "You think you can help out?" I said yeah. So um, I go and meet the labor union guy. And I said, "You realized what we got here, right?" "Biggest job in the country." I said, "Let's work this thing." And he said, "Great." So we made a deal to keep the union out of there and we charged the developer so much for every apartment that he converted. We hired all the trades, we did everything and we made a ton of money both legitimately and through the unions. And we whacked it up among everybody. John Marks: Can I ask you, the term "whack it up," is that the same as "kick it up?" Michael Franzese: Whack it up, divide it up, cut it up, share it, yeah, that's a street term. You never said share it. It's whack. Whack has different forms of uh, different uses, I would say. NARRATOR: FRANZESE  IS PART OF A NEW GENERATION OF GANGSTERS RISING UP  THROUGH THE RANKS OF THE AMERICAN MOB  IN THE LATE 1970S. ANOTHER ONE IS A  GUY NAMED JOHN GOTTI, A SMALL TIME HOOD FROM  QUEENS LOOKING TO MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF  AND LATCH ON TO ONE OF THE FIVE FAMILIES. Joseph Coffey: I was involved in various investigations of John Gotti through the years, from the time when he was a nothing guy. Salvatore Polsi: In the '70s, we were all wannabes, even John Gotti was a wannabe in the '70s. NARRATOR:  BETWEEN SCORES GOTTI KILLS TIME WITH  OTHER MOB WANNABES, SMOKING,  DRINKING, PLAYING CARDS. Salvatore Polsi: We would be playing poker, his cigar would be down, he would just hold his cards and he wanted to play. And every once in a while when he got a good hand, this long De Nobili cigar would go up in the air and I would notice! And no one spotted it! And the minute we saw that cigar go up, we were out the door! We threw our hand in! And he could never figure out what he did. He was, he had a tell. And he was a wild gambler. And he would just lose every night! NARRATOR: RUMORS  START TO SPREAD OF AN OUTSIZED  PERSONALITY IN QUEENS. Fat Sal Colombo: And all of a sudden you started hearing this John Gotti, John Gotti. John Gotti this, John Gotti that. We used to say who the (bleep) is this John Gotti? I ain't never heard of him. Salvatore Polsi: He was a wild and crazy flamboyant personality, high energy, charismatic. Joseph Coffey: He had a two-prong attack to become a made guy. In the mafia you're made either one of two ways, you're an earner or you do hits for them. If you do both, you're a huge made guy. He was. NARRATOR: IT'S THE  BEGINNING OF A LEGENDARY CAREER IN  THE AMERICAN MOB. NARRATOR: IN  THE LATE 1970S, A NEW GENERATION OF  GANGSTERS IS RISING UP THROUGH THE RANKS  OF THE AMERICAN MOB. AMONG THEM IS A  GUY NAMED JOHN GOTTI. Joseph Coffey: John Gotti was a low level gangster who was like banned from the racetracks because he was a mafia figure. He was involved in hijacking trailer trucks coming out of the airport, plus he wouldn't hesitate to kill somebody. Michael Franzese: I had my first business encounter with John Gotti. It wasn't a very pleasant experience. Two brothers came to me and they had a guy that had a flea market in Brooklyn. This guy's partner was dealing drugs and it was disruptive to the market. So I intercede, I go meet with him and we make a, an arrangement and I chase his partner out. Two weeks later, uh John calls me up, John Gotti. Yeah, hello? He says, "Mike, I need to see you." I said, "Okay." I go meet him and he says, "That flea market in Brooklyn." "Yeah?" He says, "The guy you chased out." "Yeah," I said. "He's with me." I say, "John, come on you know he just ran to you." "No, no, I know the guy a long time." John wasn't pulling out and I wasn't gonna give up. There's no way John Gotti would walk away from an argument with anybody, including himself thinking that he lost. So I said "John there's no way I wanna; this guy's a drug addict, I don't want to be around him." I said "I'm gonna buy you guys out, name your price." And it's like I knew it. He said, "You don't buy me out, I buy you out." And that's what happened. He bought me out, gave me the money and I gave my guy money, we kept some and he took the market and within 3 months they closed. It was over. So that was my first business encounter with Gotti. Joseph Coffey: John Gotti was a thug. IQ of maybe a mothball, but a thug. NARRATOR: BUT  COLOMBO FAMILY MEMBER MICHAEL FRANZESE IS  ALSO MAKING A NAME FOR HIMSELF AS AN  EARNER AMONG EARNERS. HE BRINGS IN BIG SCORES  THAT ATTRACT ATTENTION THROUGHOUT THE  FIVE FAMILIES OF THE AMERICAN MOB. BUT NOTHING SO  FAR COMPARES TO THE SCAM HE'S ABOUT  TO PULL OFF. Michael Franzese: This guy came to me and he tells me, he says, "Look, we can make some money, I've got kind of a scheme." "I have gas stations." So I said, "Alright, let's start a new company," I says and "Show me how this thing works and I'll see if I want to pursue it." I'll never forget, a week or two later, this guy came to me and he's holding a box. And he used to bring me meat, he was a butcher. He walks in, I says, "What are we having a party? What we're gonna do with all this meat?" And he says, "Hey chief, it ain't meat." And he goes in and he puts it on the kitchen table and he opens it up. He said, "First week's take in the gas business." $380,000 in cash. Got my attention, right? Selwyn Raab: Michael Franzese was an immense earner for the Colombo family and his biggest coup was something known as the "Daisy Chain Gasoline Scam." What happened was, New York State, in the 1970s, decided to use a different way of collecting gasoline excise taxes every year. Michael Franzese: At that time, whoever owned the gas station was responsible to pay the tax on every gallon of gasoline that they bought and pumped. Selwyn Raab: And somebody hit upon the idea that this was stupid. R. Lindley Devecchio: So the legislature in New York said, "Well let's make distributors responsible for paying the taxes or whatever they want to levy." NARRATOR: BUT THE GAS  COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO PAY THE TAX  ON THE HONOR SYSTEM. SO FRANZESE FIGURES  OUT ALL HE HAS TO DO IS SET UP DUMMY  COMPANIES THAT DON'T PAY. IT TAKES MONTHS FOR THE  GOVERNMENT TO FIGURE OUT THE SCAM AND COLLECT  AND BY THAT TIME THE DUMMY COMPANIES  ARE LONG GONE. R. Lindley Devecchio: It was a fairly complicated scheme that involved a lot of dummy corporations, which made it difficult to trace back the original source, that being Franzese. Edward McDonald: And somewhere along the line, a stamp would come out and would say "Tax Paid." And it was very difficult to establish just, you know, which company was saying that they paid the tax. NARRATOR: THAT'S  BECAUSE NO COMPANY IS PAYING THE TAX. ALL OF THE  MONEY IS GOING INTO MICHAEL FRANZESE'S POCKETS. Michael Franzese: I had 18 licensed companies. All of them were operating um out of Panama, so there was no trail back to any of us. Selwyn Raab: The gasoline tax scam has to go down in history as one of the most successful coups ever pulled by the mafia. Michael Franzese: I was making a lot of money in the gas business. Millions of dollars a week. I had a jet plane, I had a helicopter, I had all the money I wanted, I did whatever I wanted to do. And word was getting out on the street that even though I was handing in millions, that I was making billions. News Reporter: The so-called "Franzese Group," a new mafia organization that federal prosecutors say could be behind the mob's theft. Michael Franzese: A story came out, I believe in News Day again, that I was becoming powerful enough to break away from the Colombos and start my own family. News Reporter: Said to be behind the mobs theft of hundreds of millions of dollars in gasoline taxes in New York. Michael Franzese: My dad then got out on parole. NARRATOR:  FRANZESE'S FATHER, SONNY, IS RELEASED FROM  PRISON AFTER SERVING TIME FOR MASTERMINDING A  SERIES OF BANK ROBBERIES. BUT HE'S ALSO RUMORED TO  BE A COLD BLOODED KILLER, AN ACCUSATION  FAMILIAR TO HIS SON. Michael Franzese: Law enforcement said he killed at least 30 people, back then, now I think it's 60, but as far as a dad, he was dad for me. I loved him. I idolized my dad. He was everything that I thought a man's man should be. Every child wants a reason to love their parents. You have to give them strong reasons not to love their parents and I don't have any reason not to love mine, regardless of anything. The word gets out on the street I'm becoming a target of law enforcement and all of the sudden the two Franzeses together, the son is making tons of money, guys start to think about it. You know, a double-edged sword. Even my own father. I was told he put a contract on me. NARRATOR: BY  THE EARLY 1980S, COLOMBO CAPTAIN  MICHAEL FRANZESE'S SUCCESS IN GAS TAX SCAMS  HAS EARNED HIM AND THE COLOMBO FAMILY MILLIONS. BUT IN THE AMERICAN  MOB, SUCCESS CAN BE AS DANGEROUS AS FAILURE,  ESPECIALLY IF THE MOB THINKS YOU'RE  SKIMMING THE TAKE. SO WHEN MICHAEL'S FATHER,  THE LEGENDARY GANGSTER SONNY FRANZESE, CALLS  HIM, HE STARTS TO SWEAT. Michael Franzese: One night I get uh, a call from my dad and he said, "I gotta see ya." I said, "Okay." He was on parole so I go to his house. How ya doin, Pop? We're in the driveway of his house and he said, "Uh Junior wants to see us tonight." I said, "Okay, what time do you want me to pick you up?" He said, "Well, they want to do this differently, they want me to come in first and they want you to come in second." I said, "Why would we do that?" He says, "Well this is what they want." I said, "We're not gonna do that, dad." You're crazy if you're gonna do it. I'm not doing it. Finally, I remember, I threw my hands up, we're in the drive way. I said, "Alright Dad, I've been listening to you all my life," and I said, "I don't like it but if this is what you want we'll do it." So I leave and then Jimmy Angelina calls me and he tells me to meet him on uh, on 18th Avenue. Jimmy was a captain too at the time, I knew Jimmy all my life. I get in the car and there's a guy sitting in the back that I didn't know and uh he don't introduce me. And um, you know at that point I was just really thinking something's really bad here. It was a house in Brooklyn that we were going to. I get out of the car and I start walking. And Jimmy gets behind me. And the other guy is behind him. Now this is bad set up. And I'll be honest with you, I was getting really nervous. I wasn't a religious guy anyway but I started to pray because I really thought that I'm dead. Look, I been in the life quite a while. I know that you get walked into a room by your best friend, you don't walk out again. So um, door opens, I get in there. A couple of the guys are there and um, they start grilling me about the gas business and the money and all of this and that and everything else. And they're trying to make an impression on me that you know I'm still the boss, don't think you can get away with anything. Without saying it, they said it. I got it. NARRATOR:  THE MEETING ENDS AND TO FRANZESE'S  SURPRISE, HE'S STILL ALIVE. Michael Franzese: So now Jimmy's gonna drive me back. I said goodbye to everybody. We get in the car. I'm ready to really open up on him. I was really upset with him. He didn't tell me anything. So I get in the car and I say, "I know you all my life. You don't prepare me? You don't tell me anything that's going on?" And uh, he said, "I'm gonna tell you something Michael." He says, "You're father was in there before you tonight. He didn't help you one bit. You were on your own in there." And it really affected me in a bad way. And I said, "Man, I can't trust my own father here." I kind of felt the walls closing in on me at that point. He threw me under the bus in that he didn't defend me. And that's almost as bad as indicting me, you know? As saying, "He did it." And I said, "This money that I'm making, what do I do?" "Do I stop?" This is like a double-edged sword for me. And um, I, I didn't have an answer. I didn't have a solution. And I said, "I'm just going to keep doing what I'm doing." NARRATOR: WHILE COLOMBO  CAPTAIN MICHAEL FRANZESE STRUGGLES WITH  THE CONSEQUENCES OF HIS GAS SCAM,  ACROSS TOWN IN BROOKLYN, UNDERCOVER AGENT JOE  PISTONE IS ABOUT TO BECOME AN OFFICIAL MEMBER  OF THE BONANNO FAMILY, AN ORGANIZATION WHO  MAKE THEIR MONEY NOT JUST FROM EXTORTION AND  LOANSHARKING, BUT DRUGS. UNDER THE  ALIAS "DONNIE BRASCO," HE'S PENETRATED THE  ORGANIZATION DEEPER THAN ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT  OFFICER IN HISTORY. HE'S ABOUT TO BECOME  A MADE MAN, BUT FIRST, TO PROVE HIMSELF,  HE MUST KILL. Joe Pistone: When I was told, you got the contract to kill Bruno Indelicato, I accepted it because what am I gonna say? No, I don't want to do it? I can't do it? But we had a plan in place, you know. Sonny sent me looking for him. Sonny Black: Come on, take a walk. Joe Pistone: If I spotted him I called the FBI and they come and snatch him and we'd stage a hit. Or if they found him, they'd snatch him and we'd stage a hit. Selwyn Raab: The FBI is faced with an incredible dilemma. What are they gonna do if Joe Pistone, AKA Donnie Brasco, is asked to go along on a hit? That's a no-no. They can't do it. But will it blow his cover? And the slightest suspicion could lead to Donnie Brasco's death. NARRATOR: SO THE  FBI MAKES A DECISION. James Kossler: Joe was not allowed to become a member of La Cosa Nostra. The bureau decided that would not be in the best interest of him or the bureau, um and so we pulled him out of there. NARRATOR: AFTER SIX  LONG YEARS UNDER COVER, THE FEDS PULL PISTONE  FROM THE STREETS AND SHUTTER  OPERATION DONNIE BRASCO. NOW IT'S TIME TO LET  THE MOB KNOW THE TRUTH. Joe Pistone: When the operation was gonna be closed down we had a meeting with three agents and uh, one of them knew Sonny Black. So what I did was I took a picture with these guys with my credentials and uh, the agents went to Sonny Black [knocking sound] and they showed him a photograph of myself and the guys, uh, and they said, "You know Sonny, we just want you to know that uh this guy you know as Donnie Brasco is really Special Agent Joseph D. Pistone of the FBI. He's been working undercover for six years." And what Sonny said was, "Well, I don't know. If I see him I'll know." And that was it. Then they told him that, "Sonny, once this comes out you're better off coming with us 'cause you know you're gonna get killed." And he just told them, "Look, I don't believe it," and he just shrugged it off. And that was it. And they left. And he calls Lefty, calls the other guys in the crew, they all go to the Motion Lounge. Sonny Black: The Feds were just here. They say Donnie's FBI. Joe Pistone: And he tells 'em what happened. In the beginning Lefty couldn't believe it either. Lefty couldn't believe that I was an undercover agent. When he found out I can't say here on camera what his response was. It wasn't good, it wasn't good. NARRATOR: WORD SPREADS  IN THE STREETS BONANNO ASSOCIATE DONNIE BRASCO  IS ACTUALLY A FEDERAL AGENT, AN INFILTRATION  THAT WILL SOON SHATTER THE AMERICAN MOB. INFILTRATING THE  BONANNO FAMILY TO ITS CORE. BUT AFTER SIX  YEARS UNDERCOVER, THE FEDS PULLS HIM  OUT BEFORE HE MUST KILL SOMEONE OR  GET KILLED HIMSELF. AND THE NEWS QUICKLY  SPREADS IN THE STREETS THAT THE WISE GUY  KNOWN AS DONNIE BRASCO. Sonny Black: They say Donnie's FBI. NARRATOR: ISN'T  WHAT HE APPEARS TO BE. Michael Franzese: I remember meeting Donnie Brasco, Joe Pistone, with Lefty. We didn't have any business, it was hello and goodbye, he was there, there was nothing more discussed. But when we found out what happened and it was common knowledge on the street that he was an informant FBI agent, it was pretty shocking because they, he was almost straightened out. He had gotten that far. Joe Pistone: And then what happened once they found out it was me, uh, the Commission got together and the Commission put together a $500,000 contract out on me. NARRATOR: PISTONE  GETS OUT OF NEW YORK FAST, HIDING OUT IN  FBI HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON, DC. BUT WITHIN THE MOB THOSE  WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DONNIE BRASCO'S  RISE MUST PAY THE PRICE. Joe Pistone: Sonny had to fess up to all the bosses what had happened. So he gets a call to go to a sit down. He walks into the Motion Lounge. Bartender: Hey, Sonny. Joe Pistone: And tells the bartender, I just got called to a sit down and he gives him his ring, gives him his money, gives him his keys except his car keys and he calls his girlfriend and says, "They tell me Donnie was an undercover agent, I didn't believe it, now I believe it." If you ever see Donnie tell him I'm glad it was him. So he goes to the sit down. And the next thing they know is Sonny Black is gone. Lefty was on his way to get killed and surveillance team snatched him up because they heard that you know when he gets here we're gonna kill him, whack him. NARRATOR:  A YEAR LATER, LAW ENFORCEMENT  MAKES A GRUESOME DISCOVERY. Joe Pistone: They found Sonny's body in '82 in a body bag with his hands cut off. And the reason that they did that was he introduced me to bosses that I shook hands with. Did I want to see him die? No, I mean look, you know, that's not my job. My job is to gather evidence to put you in jail. Lefty, he spends his 15, 18 years in the can doesn't say a word. 'Cause they took that oath and they believed in that oath. They took that oath and they believed in that oath. NARRATOR: BUT  PISTONE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE CHOOSING A NEW PATH. ACROSS TOWN,  MICHAEL FRANZESE, A CAPTAIN AND TOP EARNER  IN THE COLOMBO FAMILY, IS BECOMING DISILLUSIONED  WITH HIS WAY OF LIFE. BUT THAT'S THE  LEAST OF HIS TROUBLES, LAW ENFORCEMENT'S  CLOSING IN. Michael Franzese: I started to feel the pressure in the early 80s and the government uh opened my eyes to it and that they had a major undercover operation on me, on this gasoline case and everything else. Rudolph Giuliani: It would seem that Michael Franzese is unfortunately following in the footsteps of his father. Michael Franzese: The FBI can allege and say whatever they like. They've been doing it for many, many years. Edward McDonald: Well, the FBI identified him as a significant target. Informants were providing information to the FBI about this up and coming, um, you know, sophisticated gangster. So the FBI came to us and said that they wanted to bring a case against him. Michael Franzese: I got a visit uh in my uh offices out in Long Island from two FBI agents. And they came in to see me and they said, "We need to talk to you." I said, "What do you want?" They said, "Listen, tell us what you're doing and we'll give you a pass." Yeah, right. And I said, "Well, I don't know what you're talking about with gas." You know? So I knew, and said, "This is not good." I mean I really got their attention now. Edward McDonald: We gathered evidence, primarily from cooperating witnesses and when he was faced with a lengthy trial and the prospect of getting a very lengthy sentence. Michael Franzese: People were being convicted, 100 years, 150 years, I said, they're gonna give me 1,000 years if I go down on this. Edward McDonald: He decided to plead guilty and to make restitution payments of ten million dollars, which he pretty much defaulted on. News Reporter: Michael Franzese indicted on 28 counts of racketeering, fraud and extortion. Michael Franzese: I had made two very bad decisions in my life. I trusted my father, look where it got me. I surrendered my life to La Cosa Nostra and look where it got me. I got death threats, hits all over me, the FBI hates me, everybody on the street hates me, my father disowned me. I don't have a friend in the world. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in a 6 x 8 cell. And it was the first and only time in my life that I, I really felt hopeless. Edward McDonald: Then he kind of shocked us, because he came forward and agreed to cooperate. And based on the cooperation he provided, he did get his sentenced reduced. Michael Franzese: I got 4 years on a parole violation and I spent 35 months and 13 more days in prison, 29 months and 7 days in the hole. And during that time is when I, um, strengthened my faith and um, started to read the Bible. NARRATOR: BUT  FRANZESE GETS OUT AND LIVES TO TELL THE TALE. Michael Franzese: Do I find it surprising that I'm alive? I feel I'm the most blessed guy walking the streets. What should my fate have been? I should either be dead or in prison for the rest of my life. NARRATOR: THE SON WHO  ONCE FOLLOWED HIS GANGSTER FATHER BLINDLY INTO  THE LIFE NOW WALKS AWAY FROM THE MOB  FOREVER, UNSCATHED. Edward McDonald: I cannot explain how Michael Franzese was able to do what he did. The only speculation we have is that he paid his way out. Somehow he was able to persuade people in the Colombo crime family not to do anything to him. Michael Franzese: Really, the only way that ends is when you end and you're in a coffin, it's over. NARRATOR: HOW  MICHAEL FRANZESE GOT OUT OF THE  AMERICAN MOB WITH HIS LIFE REMAINS A  MYSTERY TO THIS DAY. BUT THE WORST  DEEDS OF FRANZESE'S PAST STILL HAUNT HIM. ESPECIALLY THE  MURDER OF A CLOSE FRIEND, "CHAMPAGNE"  LARRY CARROZZA. Michael Franzese: Larry Carrozza was someone very close to me. I mean the kid loved me and I loved him. I baptized his kids. He baptized my daughter. Unbeknownst to me, he was having an affair with my sister. I was brought in and it was told to me that this is what was going on. Man: The word is on the street. NARRATOR: NO ONE  MESSES WITH MOB WOMEN. THOSE WHO DO  PAY A HEAVY PENALTY. Michael Franzese: I was told he disrespect you and he disrespected your father and that's something that uh, we don't stand for in this life and I said, "But you know, he's not a made guy." Stupid. And how do we know what really happened and let me talk to my sister," and "Nope. You want to take care of it, you take care of it. If not, we'll take care of it." And I said, "I don't wanna do it." I says, "The guy's too close to me." NARRATOR: LARRY  CARROZZA'S BODY IS FOUND NEAR HIS CAR. HE IS SHOT A SINGLE  TIME BEHIND THE EAR. Michael Franzese: His murder, that's probably something that uh has been the heaviest on my heart. NARRATOR: THESE DAYS  IT'S FAITH THAT HELPS FRANZESE COPE WITH  THE DARKNESS OF HIS PAST. Michael Franzese: Guys, be honest. You don't come to church but you figure, "Hey, Sopranos is off the air, let me go see what the real mob guy is all about, right?" [laughter]. Michael Franzese: That's your only interest. What I did, I did and that's it. As Christians, we happen to believe that we can be forgiven for what we've done in the past. So I believe with all my heart that I've been forgiven. NARRATOR: A LINE  THAT'S HARD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO SWALLOW. Michael Franzese: People can say it's a phoney thing and it's a scam and you know fortunately, in the end, they're not gonna be the ones that judge me. But I can't fool God, [laughs] you know? God bless you all. Host: Thank Michael Franzese, thank you. NARRATOR: MICHAEL FRANZESE  IS OUT OF THE LIFE TODAY, BUT HIS FATHER  SONNY NEVER WALKED AWAY. Michael Franzese: You know, my dad's 96 years old. He's the oldest living mob guy in America. I think he's part of this life 66 or 67 years ago he took the oath. Edward McDonald: He just recently was convicted at the age of 96, I think he was convicted on racketeering charges and was incarcerated again, uh, was active until the age of 96 and it's absolutely amazing. Michael Franzese: He is a treasure trove of mob stories, if you can get him to talk about them. NARRATOR: SONNY  FRANZESE IS A LAST HOLD-OVER FROM THE GOLDEN AGE  OF THE AMERICAN MOB, AN ERA THAT ENDS WITH  THE SUCCESS OF OPERATION DONNIE BRASCO, THE  HISTORIC INFILTRATION OF THE BONANNO FAMILY  BY UNDERCOVER AGENT JOE PISTONE. Michael Chertoff: Up until 1970, all you could do with the mafia is, like you know men with their eyes closed trying to feel an elephant. You would get a little piece of it, but all you could prove was someone who actually committed a particular crime. Joe Pistone did something unique, which is he infiltrated the Bonanno Family, the organized crime family, with such success that he was on the verge of being made as a member. In doing that not only did he collect direct evidence of crimes against the Bonanno Family, but he was able to talk knowledgeably about the structure of the whole mafia. Joe Pistone: This undercover case was the beginning of the unravelling of the mafia in America as we knew it, as it once was. NARRATOR: ALL IN ALL,  THE INFORMATION PISTONE PROVIDES LAW  ENFORCEMENT LEADS TO OVER 200 INDICTMENTS AND MORE  THAN 100 CONVICTIONS OF MAJOR MOB FIGURES. BUT IT IS ONLY  THE BEGINNING OF THE GOVERNMENT'S  ALL OUT ASSAULT ON THE AMERICAN MOB. James Kossler: Joe Pistone's role as Donnie Brasco was historic in the FBI. Historic in law enforcement. Rudolph Giuliani: Pistone broke the confidence of the mafia. He broke the mystique that you couldn't infiltrate the mafia. That mystique was very, very important in getting people to cooperate, 'cause now all of a sudden it isn't this impregnable organization that nobody's ever penetrated. Steve Salmieri: Joe Pistone and his case, was the perfect storm for organized crime. Joe Pistone: We, we kicked the (bleep) out of them. We really did. NARRATOR: BUT THE  AMERICAN MOB STILL HAS ENORMOUS POWER  IN NEW YORK CITY AND AROUND THE  COUNTRY IN THE 1980'S. Leonetti: You always have to use your brain and you always have to use the gun. NARRATOR: IN CITIES  LIKE PHILADELPHIA, HOME TO THE MOST  VIOLENT MOB FAMILIES IN THE UNITED STATES. Leonetti: We live by our own set of rules. NARRATOR: AND A  MAJOR BATTLEGROUND IN LAW ENFORCEMENT'S WAR TO  END THE RULE OF COSA NOSTRA. Pichini: His reign becomes a reign of terror. Nick Scarfo: I invoke my right and decline to answer the question. Leonetti: We got away with murder. [gunshots].
