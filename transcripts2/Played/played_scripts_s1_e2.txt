 It's party central. Attracts a young and affluent crowd. Lot of drugs and a thriving sex-trade. We believe she's been working there as an escort. She's fifteen years old. So we're thinking she's dead? We're not there yet. Have you got the... Yeah. The Joyce is owned and managed by two brothers, Shaun and Paul Devlin. Anything illegal happens at the hotel, they know about it. We have every reason to believe they're involved in Shannon's disappearance. Shaun went down for a summary assault. Yeah, Shaun's got a temper. Still on probation. They look rich. They are, with the classic rich-kid sense of entitlement. Have you talked to Vice, have they raided the hotel? Three times the last year, they got nothing. This guy's smart, he's gonna smell us coming. The case is now ours. We need someone inside. Alright, let's suit up. Take a look inside the Joyce. I guess that's my cue. Okay, so she's inside. What's her first move? Talks to the bartender. Gets her bearings. Why the bartender? 'Cause they see things, they know things. Vodka soda. It's a quiet night. It's still early. I was hoping for a little more excitement. I'm celebrating my birthday today. Is that right? Yes, it is. Are you meeting someone? No, I'm not. Why? Usually there's some kinda back room, private party somewhere. Impossible to get into, unless... you know someone. Or... you look like Maria. Exactly. What's in the sky? Your birthday party. JOHN: Once she gets into the party, she's on her own. JOHN: We can't get to her, but she's just observing. JOHN: Her job is to scope the room. JOHN: She's looking for girls, drugs. JOHN: Any kinda activity. JOHN: Get a sense of who the players are. About eighty people. Mostly young, in their twenties. Underage? Potentially, a couple, yeah. Any action? If you mean are people disappearing down the hall together, no. It felt more like a private party then a whorehouse, it was like the Devlins hanging out with their friends. You know who I got a hit from? It was his brother, Paul. What kinda hit? He seemed, you know... Interested. Yeah. JOHN: Forget it, no way. I'm just saying. JOHN: We're not going there. Not yet. JOHN: So what else? Any familiar faces? Dealers? Hookers? That guy you busted last year, Corey something. DANIEL: Corey White. MARIA: That's it. Corey was there? Yeah, the Pharmacist? He was dealing, doing good business. I'm grooming him as a source. We should go see Corey, see what he's got to say. Actually, Daniel, you can head back to the Joyce. Park yourself at the bar. Wait for us to call. I'll see you downstairs. We'll take my car. I wanna meet this source of yours. Maria. What was that, just now? Why are they protecting you? They aren't, I don't need protecting. Okay. I'm gonna be honest with you here, boss, she's making me a little nervous. You and me both, man. I mean, I'm sitting here with two cops, and you're asking me to confess my sins? Yeah, I don't think so. Corey, you're a scumbag drug dealer who sells information for money. And I'm making you nervous? Fine. Don't get paid. Hey, you don't talk to me that way. Hey, relax, Corey. - I don't like her attitude. - That's enough. Shaun Devlin. What do you got? He runs a party most nights. You know, rooftop, exclusive. Rich guys and models. There's a lot of cash in that room. Tell us about the girls. The young ones. Shaun's the owner, right? He's the guy, he's all about service. You know, so, Whatever the customer wants, for a price. Where's he get the girls? I mean, all I know is, there's never enough. He's always looking. Supply and demand. Can you get us inside? What does that mean? It means we card you. You make the intro and if all goes well, we pay you a ton of cash. It also means you testify. In court. Can I think about it? Sure. Take your time. You've got thirty seconds. You sure this guy's up for it? He'll be fine. ♪ Okay, they're in. Alright, here we go. Keep your phone on. And keep them in sight. COREY: Hey, Shaun, this is Danny. COREY: Danny's a DJ. Works in clubland. Hey you know what this place could use, a couple of turntables, You know? Kick it old school, mix in some new treats. I'm thinking of that corner, set my gear up... Yeah. Maybe dim the lights a bit, take it down a notch. Get this place going, you know? What's your name? Okay, yeah. No, I'll see you later, just save me a seat. Alright, bye. Sorry. I didn't realize you were on the phone. It's okay. I saw you here before. I'm gonna be honest with you, you're a little hard to miss. I'm Paul. Maria. What are you drinking, Maria? Vodka soda. Look at that. I've been spinning all over. But now I'm based at Karma. King and Brant. Oh, yeah, you probably don't know it, just opened last month, full of rich, you know? Suburban kids, coming to party downtown. But, you know... All sorts crazy stuff, you know? it's like kids at a candy store, Coke, E, Meth. And they love this guy, they love Daniel. You here by yourself? Flying solo. Nice. Sometimes you gotta... keep it clean, travel light. Excuse me. DANIEL: Devlins are on the move, Maria's gonna follow. JOHN: Okay, roger that. Stay on her, don't let her out of your sight. Hey, take it easy! (Yelling) - Where's my money?! (Yelling) - Hell, I don't have it. Where is my money? (Sound of punches) Pay up! Pay up! (Sound of punches) Roy, it's enough, enough. Enough! Stop! MARIA: Is everything okay? Who the hell are you? Relax. She's with me. I said relax. Word of advice, stay away from my brother. Get the hell out of here. Go! Get out of here! The look on his face. He was in a rage, totally out of control. Just beating the hell out of this guy. Do we know why? Something about debt, something... I don't... It doesn't matter. But... This may not mean anything to you, Rebecca, but my gut tells me, that this girl Shannon Mayburn is dead. I know it. It means something, Maria. And there may be others. And the Devlins are involved, I'm sure of it. Hey, you need to calm down. I need to get this guy. He's gonna kill somebody else, another girl. A guy like this, it's only a matter of time. The Joyce Hotel. On Bathurst, that Joyce. Not a big deal. Are you working Vice again? Don't worry about it, Mom, seriously? Don't say that to me, ever. Don't tell me it's not a big deal. You're still having nightmares. (Speaking Spanish) Come on. I can't tell you. You know that. Please don't be so dramatic. I'll be fine. You've been hearing it everyday for years. I love you. Be careful. MARIA: Love you. DANIEL: Brother Shaun just texted me. He Wants me to come to the hotel later. It's good, he's on the hook. How'd Corey do? Honestly, he was a little shaky. If he's shaky, we need to settle him down. Don't worry, we will. It's late to pull him, Devlin's smart, he'll smell it. Yeah, we'll give him a pep talk. In the meantime Daniel needs a girl, something to bait Devlin with. Some photos from my phone. - We're already there. Right? Photos? - Yeah. Something like this? Yup. They look young. Fresh out of the academy. Any thoughts about what you saw last night? We should take a closer look at his brother, Paul. He's close to Shaun, they run the Joyce together. And he likes me. These two guys have a violent streak, right? Paul could be the weak link. I'd like to stay on him. He could get me closer to his brother. REBECCA: Alright. Let's put a tail on him. Use Jesse and Khali. Got a second? Tell me what happened to Maria. Something happened. Maybe you should ask her yourself. I'm asking you. You're the one that's worried. She took an extended absence last year. Yeah, she needed to take sometime off. You're gonna have to do better than that. I made a bad call. A year ago last spring, we were on a project with Vice on Sherbourne. She went undercover as a prostitute and she got beaten up by a john. Real bad. How bad? Broken jaw. Three broken ribs. One punctured a lung. He took a crowbar to her. She tried to shield herself but he crushed both of her forearms. Jesus. Eight weeks in hospital. Four months off the job. It was my project. And I couldn't get to her, and it was my fault. And you covered it up? Car accident. They're gonna stick her on a desk, anyway, So she begged me to keep it quiet. You should've told me. Well, now you know. I'm not gonna report you, I'm trying to keep you alive. All of you. I'm putting her in play in a Vice Op, and I don't know about this? You need to start trusting me, John. Right now. Or this unit is not gonna work. Daniel's waiting. KHALI: People are creatures of habit. Same route into work every morning. Stop at the same place for coffee. You gotta learn the habits, look for deviations, most people it doesn't take long. If Devlin's got a secret, we'll find it. Why don't you head over there? take a look. You like telling me what to do? Just go already. Okay. Two or three mickeys a day, everyday. Somebody told me once, you could get away with it because it had no smell, vodka. They were so wrong. I used to keep my bottles stashed in various places. Paul Devlin's an alcoholic. He's in A.A. We tagged him at a meeting. Really? It's a crack, if I stay on him and work my way in, I can... What's wrong? I know what happened... last year. Do I need to pull you off this case? The guy's in prison. He's got another two years. I've dealt with it. And I need to be able to prove that. I want you to keep your distance from Devlin. Just surveillance for now. Daniel will take the lead, he'll show the girls to Shaun, see if he bites. Okay. lets do this. Right over there. Hey. Sit down and take a breath. Yeah, yeah. I'm good, I'm good. My brother, Paul. Hey, what's up, man? What's up? What's up? You two need a drink. I got a new bourbon, just in. 18 year old, single barrel. I got a guy in Louisville, place in the hills. Nice. Pure vanilla. Thanks. Oh, that is good. That is smooth. So, these girls. You're at the club, you're spinning... they talk to you? Sure. Make friends, fans? I guess you could say that, yeah. How old are these girls? Yeah know how it is man, they all got fake IDs, right? Check it out, look. Most of them, it's bad at home, you know, they're itching to get out. And then they get a taste of the drugs and all that, then it's all down hill from there. Right? Oh, my God, these girls are hot. DJ D, bringing the fine ladies. Oh yeah, babe, that one. Oh, oh, God. You know, it's my bad. It's my bad. You know, you gotta jump on that, man. I mean... I wouldn't hesitate if I were you. you know? I mean, think about it, you know? What did you say your name was again? Daniel. Girls call me DJ D. Daniel, Daniel, Daniel. I want you to write down where you met Daniel. And then Daniel here is gonna tell me what it says. Shaun, I told you... Shh. Just write it down. You know... You know what? I just gonna to use the... I'll be... I'll be right back, okay? You should go now. Yeah. Thanks for the bourbon. He was high and he could barely talk, we went over this, like, fifteen times and he screwed it up. Just settle down. No, no I'm burned, it's over I'm done. - You said you were gonna talk to him! - And I did. It's the risks that we take and you know that, alright? Now, just settle down and we'll talk about it tomorrow, alright? I shouldn't have listened to you. That was my mistake. We still have Maria. She's watching the brother. We'll regroup tomorrow. What's your name? John. You look lonely, John. Do I? I'm not interested, but thanks. You have a good night. You too. Sorry about that. It's no worries, man, she's a beautiful girl. But I already have that at home, right? So... I'm actually looking for something a little more... sweet. You see that door in the corner? Yeah. Have a good night. What's your name? John. John what? Smith. What do you do, John Smith? I'm a tax lawyer. So tell me... what did you do at work today? I don't think you'd understand. Alright, this morning, I spent the whole time advising an equity client on flow-through share transactions. Then I had lunch. Then I structured a corporate sale by using exchangeable shares to maximize available tax deferrals. Among other things. Do you like bourbon? I wouldn't say no. (Knock at the door) Hey. Hi. I'm Angel. Hi, Angel. Would you like something from the mini bar? What would you like me to do? I don't know. What are my options? Half and half, around the world... whatever you like. Should I... would you like me to get undressed? No. My daughter's about your age. She writes music on her guitar. She's really good. I used to love listening to the sound of her practice, do you know why? 'cause it meant that she was at home. She was safe. Do you wanna go home, Angel? Do you wanna go home? ♪ How long have we been here? 90 minutes. MARIA: This is unless. Where's she going? Excuse me. Hi. Have any credit cards turned up? I left mine somewhere... You wanna leave your number? Yeah, sure, that would be great. Thanks. That's my cell. Hey, remember me? I need to apologize. You know what? It's okay, really. Just give me a second. I'm an alcoholic. And I was drinking last night. I'm sorry about what you saw and what I said. It must have been upsetting and I apologize. Whatever, I'm sure you had your reasons. Maybe he deserved it. What was your name again? Maria. Paul, right? Yeah. You wanna sit down for a second? Yeah, I don't think so. But I'll see you around. Nicole Lewis, she's 15 years of age. She goes to St. Alban's. Grade ten. You just did this all by yourself, huh? Daniel was done and we had nothing to lose. You called the parents? They're on the way? Yup. Single mom, Karen. Nicole, my name is Rebecca. Do you mind if I ask you some questions? Can you tell me the first time you met Shaun Devlin? How long have you been working for him? (Knock On Door) Oh no. Nicole? Come on, don't do this. I don't want her here. MOTHER: Oh, sweetie. MOTHER: You don't mean that. MOTHER: I'm gonna stay right here. Right beside you. You should know I have plenty of time, Nicole. I'm in no rush. MOTHER: Please, Nicole. I started going into the hotel, to the bar. This was... Couple months ago. And I got served no problem. And, like, the second time I went, he came over, and he bought me drinks. And him and his brother kept buying me things, they were nice, they were like crazy-nice. Did you know this was happening? We haven't been getting along. She's been staying with friends. She texts me every day. REBECCA: Do you know this girl? I've seen her. At the hotel? Do you know where she is? What happened to her? Nicole, have you ever heard about any of the girls getting... hurt? Or beat up? Does Shaun ever do that? He'd, um... he'd give us drugs. What kinda drugs? Anything, Crank, E, Special K. We had to earn it, y'know? I was in my car but I turned around. Now, I'm gonna sit down, but I need to know that you're serious about the program before I do. I was eight months clean. 'Til last night. That one's just over a year old. Since then, four months, two months, and the latest, twenty-four hours. Do I have to tell you this next part? You do, Nicole, I'm sorry. About a week after I started... we got a room, just us. Tell me what happened, tell me what he did. Paul, he had a knife. It was Paul? When he drinks, he's a psycho, he's a psycho. I keep falling. But I guess you know what that's like. Yeah. I thought he was gonna kill me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Okay, it's okay. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Nicole, look at me. Nicole, we're gonna get him for what he did to you. We're gonna get him. Well, if we're gonna be friends, Paul, I'm gonna need some coffee. REBECCA: We can assume that Shannon Mayburn is dead and Paul Devlin killed her. Let's pick him up, we've got the girl's statement. No way, he'll just lawyer up and shut down. If we can get proof, we'll take 'em both, Shaun for pimping girls, Paul for murder. MARIA: Two for one. How exactly do we do that? I'm fried, John's in play. MARIA: Paul Devlin's a mess. he's a Binge drinker, he's in and out of A.A. Full of cracks. I've had contact with him twice in the last... Wait a second. Twice? When was the second time? Last night, at the cafe. I had Khali and Jesse outside. You spoke to him? I let him know that, just like him, I was on the wagon. I was struggling. And I needed a friend. And now he wants to take me to dinner. That's our next step. We'll spike him. Rattle his cage a little, see how he reacts. No way. John, I can get this guy. This is a bad idea. We already know he's violent. What you're gonna do? you're gonna provoke him? Is that it? I'm not fifteen years old. Maria, the only thing he wants, is to bang you, okay? You can dress it up all you like, but trust me, that's what this guy wants. That's his goal. And at some point, he's gonna force the issue. You know what happens then, right? you've been there. - I'm not worried. - You not worried? Well. you should be. Then you shouldn't talk about taking chances. This is the job! And if you don't think I can do it, then why am I here!? She's right, John. You said it yourself, we should trust her. Last year I got beaten up by a target. I almost died. That's what this is about. Okay. Yesterday, at the meeting, Did Devlin see Jesse? No. He's clear. Good, so we'll use Jesse. Alright? Let's go, let's work it up. ♪ I mean, you were there, at the hotel, you saw the world. It's like one giant trigger. Right? And I gotta work there. I mean, that's my job, that's what I do. Yeah, you're screwed. I am screwed. Yeah... REBECCA: Looks good, everything's good, we're almost there. Okay, roger that. Anything? All good. A.A. talk. She's being careful. Alright, here we go. I mean, even this, I find this hard. Y'know, you go to a restaurant, then you order a cocktail. And a bottle of wine. Yeah, but what else you gonna do, sit at home? Being with you is a trigger. On a date. Flirting. That's a trigger. Okay, short and sweet, keep him off balance. Don't forget to breathe. Are you gonna throw-up? No. Because if your gonna throw-up you should do it now. I'm good. Come on, let's go. Hey, slow down. We're supposed to be in love, remember? Still think I'm bossy? No. Now. Go now. Can I help you? You're the one in the photos. Look, you're interrupting something here. My name is Mayburn. Jesse Mayburn. My sister's name is Shannon. Shannon Mayburn. JESSE: She had pictures of you on her phone. She told me all about you. Lower your voice. Where is she? What did you do to her? She's fifteen years old! KHALI: Jesse stop it. Let's go! I'm sorry. Okay, I can explain that. No, I really should be going. Maria, hang on a sec, let me just... Damn it. They're leaving. REBECCA: Once she's clear, we're gonna head back to H.Q. I need to explain. - It's okay. - No. These kids come to the hotel, okay? and they love to party. I don't know who that was or what he thinks I did. Stop. Stop talking, I believe you. JOHN: What do you doing, Maria? Get out of there. You must have been freaked out, that had to have been a little upsetting. If I were you, I'd need a drink. JOHN: Don't do it, don't do it. Son of a... JOHN: Alright, let's keep them in sight, this guy's dangerous. Slow down. We've got nothing but time. DANIEL: Find a spot at the bar. If you see anything, text us. JOHN: Do we have audio? REBECCA: Her phone's off. Where is she? In what room? REBECCA: She'll find a way... JOHN: What room is she in? She'll tell us. Stay in the lobby. I got this fantasy, where I just get on a plane. One way ticket, some beach somewhere. Some little bungalow. And just hide, right? I mean, everything we've done, just get a clean slate. Yeah. Oh shoot, damn, I forgot, I have to tell my mom not to wait up. You still live with your mother? Shut up. Come on. (Phone vibrates) 1005. She's in room 1005. We've got audio. Phones back on. They're still talking. How long do we leave her in there? She needs time. She'll find her moment. - Not so bad. - I have like... seriously, the amends I have to make. Are you kidding me? Amends? What? I got nine pages of amends. Come on. I'm serious. Like what, huh? You tune up some guy? That's not amend, that's business. Okay, umm. Okay, you wanna hear this? You're gonna tell me about some girl, aren't you? That kid at the restaurant tonight, what's his sister, the photos. Shannon, something. Mayburn. Shannon Mayburn. So what happened? You called her a name? You were mean to her and she's on your list? She was a regular at the bar. So maybe I bought her a few drinks. This is before she went missing? REBECCA: Don't go in there, stay in the hall. She's that girl, right? I heard all about it. I didn't touch that girl. No, I know. I have an alibi. Night she disappeared I got, like, six people who were with me. And I bet every single one of them works for you, am I right? What are they saying? They're talking, she's fine. You're gonna wait for my order. See, I'm not an idiot. I asked around, you're a tough guy. That's enough. I know what tough guys do, what they do to young girls, I know all about it. So what happened? What's the amend? I said that's enough. I want her out now. It's my call, she knows what she's doing. - You gonna get tough on me, tough guy? - Get off. - Stop it! - Is that what happens next? Come on, tough guy, come on! Shut up. *** Yeah, I killed her, is that what you wanna hear? I killed her. That's it. We got it. Police! Don't you move! Don't go! You okay? - You alright? - Yeah. DANIEL: Paul Devlin, you're under arrest for the murder of Shannon Mayburn. ♪ Four girls, all underage. We've got Shaun Devlin cold on procure for the purpose, trafficking, aggravated sexual assault. How about Shannon Mayburn? Homicide recovered her body. She was buried in the woods, north of the city. Brother Paul gave up the location. It's quite the risk, you leaving her inside that room all alone. But you were right, it was a good call. I'm gonna savour this moment. ♪ He could've been a little taller. But he was good looking. I told him, I'm forty-two years old-ish. And I don't have time for games. So he's got fifteen minutes to impress me and then, I move on. (Knock at the door) - I got it. - Okay. You're out of control, you know that? Hey. Hey. I just came to say that... I'll never forget the moment that I saw you lying there in the hospital. What that guy did to you. I swear I'll never doubt you again. I promise. Do you want some apple pie? No, I gotta go. Say hi to your mom for me, alright? See you tomorrow? Yeah. - synced & corrected by Asailow - - www.addic7ed.com -
