 Amanda attempts to steal a medallion that was once given to her by a former slave who she befriended, but the job is interrupted by two other thieves who trip the alarm. When one of the thieves turns up dead, only to walk away later, Nick begins to wonder if he's immortal, but Amanda doesn't think so because she didn't detect him. As Amanda continues her search for the medallion, which leads her right to the thief, she finds out what he is really after.

 He found her. Together, they brought back light to the world. I was a cop. To me she was just a thief, another day on the job. But she wasn't-- She changed my life, changed everything. And both of us knew from that moment on, nothing would ever be the same. Wait a minute, darling. It gets better. I had to toss most of my gear-- the grapple hooks, the new winch I bought-- it's all history. All because of a couple of amateurs. He didn't even know he was stepping onto a weight-sensitive floor. Uno momento.

 I'm not getting sentimental, Lucy. You know me. I just want what I want when I want it. I am so tired of hearing what the old Amanda would've done. I'm the old Amanda. Coming! Lucy, please, quit worrying. I love you too. Please tell your sister I hope she gets better soon. All right? I'll call you later. Bye-bye. Hi. Isn't it, like, 6:30 in the morning or something? It's kind of early. I was in the neighborhood. Coffee? Not unless it's ice. The heat wave's killing me. Is it bothering you? Don't change the subject. Ah, was there a subject to change? Look, I'd love to sit and have breakfast with you, but I'm tired. Must've been a late night. Evidently. Where'd you go? I don't think that's any of your business. Oh, it's a cheese Danish, my favorite! Amanda. What? Are you writing a story or something? About the Waterview Auction House. You know the one. Waterview Auction House. That would be the auction house with a view of the water. Yeah, I've been by there a couple of times. On one of those drive-bys, you didn't happen to smash open a few glass cases, did you? You have a magnificent imagination. I do love a good piece of fiction. Actually, it's a true crime. It just happened. Oh, really? There was a heist there last night. Fits your M. O. A little sloppy though. Figure maybe you were in a real hurry. Good-bye, Nick. Tell me you had nothing to do with it. Would you please quit doing this. Do what? Interrogate me. Then tell me you had nothing to do with it. I had nothing to do with it. Tell me again. Look, I'm going to bed because I'm very sleepy. I think you know the way out. Where were you last night? I had a date. Didn't happen to be with the guy they fished out of the lake this morning? Are you still here? Who was he? How the hell would I know? If someone was fished out of the lake, it has nothing to do with me. Well, when you're a cop, little details tend to bother you. You're not a cop. Like finding small pieces of glass in somebody's hair. Makes you wonder how it got there. Maybe they cut open a skylight. Didn't I ask you to leave? Fine. You dig yourself out of this one. I'm done! No thanks. I find it unnatural... to chew something I have no intention of swallowing. Been reading your file. And your lips didn't get too tired? Smart mouth. It was you who stole the Marshall Collection. Really? And before that you hit the Federal Savings. And before that I stole the Star of India from the Duke of Wellington. Is this a confession? Yes. It was 1819-- Maybe it was 1820. Hm. Smart lady. We know you slipped through a few nets in the past. Dumb cops. Got lucky. You won't again. I wouldn't be too sure. We got your gear. Oh, yeah? Did you get some prints? I guess not. Oh, my God, am I using that monogram stuff again? Nick I. D. 'd it for us. Nick who? You think he'll stick by you? Not a chance. Lookin' out for number one, that's our Nicky. That's what he does. Oh, my God. I am so confused. I'm just not sure who to trust. You know, it's a shame. A pretty woman like you, 10, 20 years in the can, you'll hardly recognize yourself. You'd be surprised. Have it your way. But you're takin' the fall for this one. Only question is: Do you wanna take it alone? Where'd you get this tie? What happened to you, Wolfe? You're one of us, for God's sake. Not anymore. Your call, not mine. You know, Frost and some of the others... think you're in it with her. Really? What do you think? I don't know. Beats the hell out of workin' for a livin'. - Who's the guy who died? - You're wasting your time-- And, more importantly, you're wasting mine. Hey, Wolfe, your girlfriend just rolled. Remember how I taught you not to blink when you lie? - You blinked. - Screw you. I laid it out for her, and she signed on the dotted line. - She signed? She still got all her teeth? - Son of a bi-- All right. Get out. Later. Now! What? He's a good cop. He does his job. He remembers only what you tell him. You were a good cop too. I'm tryin' to help you here, Nick. How deep are you in this? We done here? Is she really worth pissing it all away for? Weatherman's predicting another scorcher. Keep those A. C. 's cranked up. Well, that's a good way to get yourself dead. - You're supposed to be dead. - Where is it? Hey, they said you drowned. Yeah? Well, they were wrong. How did you do it? It doesn't matter. Give me what I paid for. I didn't get it. Sorry. You lose. What the hell are you doin', man? Now, I'm gonna begin calmly. I only care about one thing and you knew that. Now, I want you to explain, in terms I can understand, why you leave it behind. Put the blade down, Simon. I'm gonna make you-- We are gonna... go back for it. Not if you kill me. Well, if that auction house sold it or that woman got it, yes, I will. Okay, just relax. If she has it, we'll find her, okay? You know where she is? There's only a c-couple of people... in town who could've pulled that off. Uh-huh. Yeah. Huh? Cut the crap. What the hell were you doin'? Leave me alone. I took a walk down to evidence. I saw the winch. I saw the cutters. I recognize that stuff. It's yours. This has nothing to do with you, okay? No, not okay. I told them I'd never seen it before. What is it, you're broke? You need the money? No. Look, I'm sorry... - you're in the middle of this. - What the hell is so important anyway? Move along, now. Bales are almost loaded. Hurry up. Stay in line. Eyes forward. Look sharp there. Maintain an orderly queue. Excuse me, sir. Has theMaria Rose set sail? She departs with the evening tide-- but not for your kind. Not as passengers-- cargo, perhaps. Not as passengers. Here, a deed and papers of manumission. Our former masters passed away. They bestowed us with 50 acres of land-- our very own-- free and clear. A few pieces of paper-- worthless. But arrangements have been made on our behalf for one-way passages. If you would just check the ship's manifest. If you want the land that badly, then swim for it. - Marcel. - What's this? A challenge? On your knees. Never again, sir. Marcel, think of the children, hmm? No! On your knees, slave! - No, please! - Move away, Louise. - Do as he says, woman. - We are very sorry, sir. We did not mean any disrespect. Please. Please, spare my husband's life. They're unarmed. I'm not. A gentleman does not duel with a lady. Well, then, you should have no problem. They'll be joining me on theMaria Rose as my guests. I'm sure you'll make the necessary arrangements. Try moving your lips. Yes, I shall see to it. Excellent. I'd force you to apologize, but you're not worthy of their forgiveness. Please accept our deepest gratitude. You're quite welcome. Louise. This is my husband, Marcel. We are deeply in your debt, miss. - Amanda. - How can we repay you, Miss Amanda? - It's not necessary. - Please, Miss Amanda, you must tell us how. All right. If you insist. From now on, call me "Amanda"-- just that, Amanda. Come on. If he gives you any trouble at all, promise you'll come to me. Thank you for your kindness. Are you gonna talk to me about this? Would you just let it go? That's code for "Immortal. " He's not an Immortal. I swear-- I'm telling you the truth. The corpse just gets up and walks away. If that's not an Immortal, I don't know what is. Right. He's the lead story in every newspaper. Who is he? I told you; I don't know. I thought you said he wasn't immortal. He isn't. Right. They found a cure for drowning. He's not an Immortal. I would've sensed him. I didn't sense him. So what were you two after? Or were you just out working on spec? Nick, I told you I didn't see him before last night. Okay, we've established that. You've never seen him before. You work alone. He broke in separately. Who got there first? I did. You did. Okay. He surprised you. That's why you hit and ran. No, that was his partner. Partner? You guys holding a convention? I told you. Where you going? Away from you! Wait a minute. What? You're not getting off so easy. What are you gonna do, arrest me? I don't have to answer to you or anyone. Why do you do it? Why do I do what? After all this time, why are you still just a thief? Why are you still a cop? I'm not. You could be anything you wanted, something better. In 1,200 years, you could've been anything you wanted. Hey, you! Come on! After her! It's her! That's your perspective on history? - That's the truth. - The truth. Let me tell you something about the truth. It's an overvalued commodity. It changes with your perspective, and it mutates with time. What are you laughing at? You bob and weave more than Ali in his prime. Why don't you just answer the question. Why do you do it? You wouldn't understand. Try me. Do you know what they called women in the Middle Ages... who tried to better their lives, who demanded respect? They called them "witches," and they burned them at the stake. Now, the men who traveled from town to town and sold their services... they called "Knight Errants" or "Ronins" or "Mercenaries. " The women-- they called "whores. " Spoken like a true con. "It wasn't my fault. " "My mother didn't like me. " "I had a bad childhood. " "My father drank. That's why I killed the people while robbing the gas station. " You're right. You win. I steal because I like it. See you around. The city continues to broil... under the record-breaking heat wave on this, the hottest day ever in July. Three deaths have already been attributed to the relentless temperatures. I'm eating. Look, unless you're here to confess, find yourself a table. You read the papers? I got budget cuts comin' out my ass. The coroner's pulling double shifts-- Dead suspects he can't even hang onto. Do I need to read the papers? Who is he? You tell me. Pass the mustard. Who's in town? Who could pull off something like that? You mean besides your girlfriend? All right. I'll just throw out some names. You chew and nod. This is a cop bar, Wolfe. Don't worry. You eat fast enough, nobody'll notice. - Thanks for the tip, Carl. - You gave him our lead? You gave him Del Deegan? Mm! Del Deegan? Riley Del Deegan? He's out? Thanks for the tip, Frost. Stay clean, Nick. I'm not a cop now, Wolfe. You wanna dance? No. Lunch is on me. Be smart. Let it ride. Say, you gonna eat that? Just askin'. Lovely. You brought them. Got your message, ducks. I just got in three little items I thought you'd be interested in. Came by them fair and square. Of course you did. We have here a lovely crystal vase. I thought it'd look smashing on your sideboard there. A lamp for the library. And a delightful little oil by Mary Cassatt, circa 1900. I think you're familiar with it. Yes, I can't believe that old thing is still making the rounds. Put that back. You're not interested then? - Nothing from theMaria Rose? - I wouldn't go near it. Too hot. Too hot? You burn down your own business to get the insurance money, and you're bitching about too hot? Tragic accident. That the police are still investigating. Now who's handling theMaria Rose,Basil? Don't know, dearie. You are such a terrible liar. You brought me here under false pretenses, you did. You don't want to buy at all. So sue me. It's the Immortal you're interested in. I want you to sit down and tell me all about it. Only what I read in the papers, duckie. I don't interfere in Immortal business, if I can help it. I'm rather fond of my head where it is. He's not immortal, Basil. I was there. I saw him. I didn't sense him. Really? Mm. How did he rise from the dead? I don't know. Maybe he wasn't dead. Or maybe you need to give your head a shake. Your radar's wonky. Basil, there's an item on theMaria Rose-- it's very important to me, very personal. - Sentimental? You? - I want you to find the item and to arrange a meeting. Maybe some other time. Oh! Bloody hell! That's Tiffany. And what is this smashing little item? Waterford. Hand it here, duckie. After you make the phone call,duckie. Ooh, this is quite heavy. All right. You win. Hand it over. Get on the phone, Basil. My motor control is iffy when I'm irritated. Make the call. Make the call. Get your ass out on the streets, you lazy broads. Back off, Jake. I'm working. Hey, here comes one now. Well, look who it is. It's Detective, uh-- Oops! I'm sorry. It's nobody. Take a walk. You'd better listen to him, girls. Women have a way of dying around him-- like his partner. See ya, good-lookin'. - Who's it killed that bitch? Rumor on the street had it was a cop. Can't imagine cops killing cops. You know, like, why can't we all just get along? You can't do that, cop! This is my street, my rules! You're not a cop! That's right, Jake. I'm not a cop. Where's Ronnie Del Deegan? Time to die, Wolfe. Where's Ronnie Del Deegan? Screw you! You must be light on brains, Jake. Back off! For the last time, where's Riley Del Deegan? Screw you! Hey, come on. Give him up, Jake. Where's Riley Del Deegan? What are you doing? Why aren't you ready? 'Cause I'm not goin' back in. - Get dressed. - No. Maybe you didn't hear me. She's lookin' for me. Yeah, right. Like she knows you're alive. Hey, shut up! I'm gonna get me a car like that. Tell me again how you don't know this guy. I didn't. I don't. Look, just go away. Riley Del Deegan. Who cares? I doesn't matter. - As soon as you walk in there, you become an accessory. - I already am. Dead? That's right, 1410 Longleaf, Room 12-B. Call the coroner. If you'd have been straight with me from the start, he still might be alive. - Okay, I apologize. - That's it? Look, he was a punk. He was a petty thief. - And you? - Never petty, darling. - Never dead. - Mm-hmm. What the hell are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? This is a crime scene. You took the badge off a month ago. What? It must've been difficult having your ex-captain grill you like that. Let it go. That's evidence. It's not evidence. It's mine. Here. It's for you. Amanda. It's a present. No, it's not necessary, Louise. If it hadn't been for you, my Marcel would be dead. It was a gift from my missus. For 30 years, she treated us kindly. Decent. My babies were as dear to her as her own. It's-It's lovely, but, um, it was a gift to you. It was given to me as a slave... and now I give it as a free woman. Please. Do me the honor-- To remember me by. To remember me by. Put it back, Amanda. - Are you coming or not? - Not. What's to stay for? He's obviously not talking. - The police are on their way. - Even more reason for you to leave. There's the door. Fine. Well, what are you gonna say? The truth. Don't worry. I'll leave you out of it. - Why? - What do you mean why? Why would you do that? You better get outta here. Don't be frightened. I'm not. You're injured. It's nothin'. I, um, just missed you at the motel. You left quite a mess for the maid. Everything's all gone to hell. No one was supposed to get hurt. They never are. Why don't you just put the gun down and we can-- I will. I will, but-but there's somethin' first, huh? - What is it? - The auction house. I want you to break in tonight. Interesting. All right, my turn. You were dead; now you're alive. How did that happen? I wasn't dead. I was-- suspended between life and death. How? The drugs. Drugs. In the Caribbean, there's certain herbs-- you chew the leaves, and they slow down your heartbeat... and your breathing, so it's barely detectable. Really? My family were once slaves. They learned how to fake their own deaths that way. It stopped them from being beaten. Those were terrible times. I don't want your sympathy. I want your help. Okay, but let's, uh, put the gun down, okay? Nice. Another dead body and you're still walkin' around. Leave, Harmon. You killed Del Deegan-- or you had him killed. Brilliant. Then I called the cops. That's because we gave him up to you. It's the only way you could cover your ass. You may have fooled the captain, but I know who you are. It's never been about this case. This is about Ryan Blake. This has nothin' to do with that maggot. Well, the charges never would've been dropped... if you hadn't beat the crap out of him. He stabbed my partner. So, you broke his jaw and four of his ribs. Instead of going to jail, he does a short stint in a county hospital and walks. Two weeks later, he's out, holds up a Dairy Queen, kills the owner and his wife. Maybe if you'd backed me up. No, you mean lie for you to the grand jury. Instead you said nothing. That made me look worse. He was scum. Who cared how his ribs got broken? Ask the families of the two who died. See if they care. Wherever you go, whatever you do, I'm gonna be all over your ass. Why, Frosty, are you comin' onto me? 278 years. My family's waited long enough. So, I'm asking you again. Will you do this? It can't be done. There's got to be a way. Look, half my gear is gone, and, by now, they've doubled the security on that building. There's no one else. It's a two-man job. Fine. I'll help. Look at you. You can barely stand up. I'll do it if I have to. Please. Please. If not for me, huh, then for my-my son and my daughter. I can't tell them I've failed. Can I trust you? You're here, aren't you? How you doin'? You okay there? So far, so good. One way or another, we'll take care of this. I know. Sorry to have to lean on you like this. Don't worry. It's fine. Let's just get you in the car. You'll feel better when you're sitting. The sand is so, so white. By morning, it will be yours, and we'll both be drinking champagne, darling. You gonna be okay? Yeah. Fine. I'm fine! All right. All right. Look, this is what we're gonna communicate with. All right. When I say, "stop" that means stop lowering me. That means right away. Okay. Yeah. Okay. We're gonna use this for leverage. Clove hitch? I prefer using a bowline. -It's not what you think. - Oh, no. You're not here to break in-- you were just up for a bungee jump. Hold it. Look, I know this might not kill you, but from what I understand, it sure stings. - You are so wrong, Nick. - Let's go. Party's over. I have to get the deed before it's gone in the morning. Hold it! It's gonna be sold tomorrow morning! Look, just let him-- Just let him talk. Let him-- 50 acres. Freedom. All... gone. His ancestors went down with theMaria Rose. There were documents that gave them their freedom and some land... that went down with them. Their orphaned children were sold into slavery. He's just here claiming what's rightfully his. I'm gonna help him. Well, tomorrow he can pick up a paddle and make a bid. Are you kidding? Those papers were signed by George I. It's gonna go for at least a quarter of a million dollars. Please, send it to my family. Send it to my children. Yes. How much longer before he comes back to life? He's not coming back. Will you help me? You really buy this guy's story? It's not a story. I was there. Marcel! Marcel! It's okay, Louise. I'm here. I'm here. Tell me again about your children, about Ren? , the one who made your bonnet. That's Eloise. Ren? is the singer. And she has a pretty voice. Yes. Yes. Like an angel. She's only 10. She cried when we left. Nearly broke my heart. Oh, I promised her... that she'd be fine. We'd all be fine. The next time we saw each other... would be on our very own land. Yes, your land. Tell me about the land. The 50 acres of paradise. I'll never see it. Louise, open your eyes. You can see it. Think a-- Think about the sky, Louise. How it's the most wonderful place in the world. How the water sparkles like sapphires, and the sand is so white... it hurts your eyes. Open your eyes, Louise, and listen to me. Listen to me. Louise. You knew them? I watched them die. Look, Nick, I know you're not a thief. This pushes all your buttons. Amanda! I don't want to hear about how this is illegal. You know, slavery was legal. I should know. I was there. It was legal and it was wrong. Will you shut up for a minute? No, sometimes breaking the law is the right thing. I know. You know? Let's do it. - Really? - Really. Are you sure about this? When are you gonna learn to take "Yes" for an answer? For luck. Hmm? All right. Okay. So we can communicate. - Are you all right? - Fine. A little lower. Stop. Fine. Stop here. Warning! Warning! Current activity is a breach of security system integrity. Automatic containment procedures are in immediate effect. - How much longer? - Keep still. You're moving me around. - Hurry up. - Almost there. Almost there. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Amanda, we gotta go. They're over there! Where? Thanks. Now, they're in the elevator. Remind me to put your doorman on my Christmas list. Hurry. Police! Open up! Wolfe, we know you're in there. - Whoops! Careful. -They're in there. You go. You'd better hope you're right. # That was just an old tune # That I always croon - Hello, boys. You know, two's company, but four can get you busted. The auction house was hit 15 minutes ago. Where were you? - You've gotta be kidding me. - 20 bucks says he's completely dressed under there. # Whispering your name - Get up. - Carl? - Do it. Hmm-mmm. # If I can stumble that far and pretend You can pay me outside. # You're a chump # Not a champ # You're an old burned-out lamp Just made it! # Got an eye on you Well, that is one way to cool off. Your clothes will be dry any minute. Would you help me put this on? Mm. So, I want you to tell me how the heist made you feel. Did it make you feel really alive and exhilarated? It wasn't terrible. Well, then smile because we did a good thing. This goes to his children. I only have one question. What is the story behind the tattoo on your butt?
