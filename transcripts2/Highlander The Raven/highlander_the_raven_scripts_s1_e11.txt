Thank you, laddie. You're a splendid fella. Yeah. Cheers.

Bob, I took it right to the top, but there's no more over... time. Bob? The son of a bitch is drunk. Once a drunk, always a drunk. She is immortal. A thousand years old and she cannot die. A creature of legend... like the raven, a thief who stole the sun and the moon. They sent a warrior to bring her back. He found her. Together, they brought back light to the world. I was a cop. To me she was just a thief, another day on the job. But she wasn't-- She changed my life, changed everything. And both of us knew from that moment on, nothing would ever be the same. Amanda, in or out tonight? Oh, whatever. I'll make a reservation at Mario's. Uh, you know, I'm really not in the mood for Italian tonight. Okay. What about the Thai place on the corner? Uh, too spicy. French? Too rich. Tell you what. Why don't you make the reservation? Oh! What? You know, what if I move the sofa over by the sideboard? Or what if I put the sofa where the chairs are and the chairs in front of the fireplace? Or we could put the chairs-- No, that won't work. Amanda, whenever you start buying new rugs... and rearranging the furniture, I know we're in trouble. Oh, I just need a change, Lucy. I'm turning into a fossil. Must be the end-of-the-century ennui. I guess when you've gone down with theTitanic, been mauled by a lion, tangoed on top of the Eiffel Tower-- Playing Trivial Pursuit and having Chinese food just doesn't hold the same appeal. - Poor baby. - Mmm. - Mmm. - Why don't I get it. Mmm. What is it? Well, either Harry in the garage has been drinking again... or Evel Knievel just had a stunt go terribly wrong... on the freight elevator. He is an Immortal, and he's admired my work over the centuries. He'd like me to accept this gift-- this small token-- and wants to hand me the keys over dinner tomorrow tonight. - Who? - His name is Victor Hansen. Never heard of him. Oh, neither have I. But, my God, he makes a good first impression. I would like you to ring up my gentleman caller, Mr. Hansen, and tell him he's expected at 6:00. So he found me passed out on my desk with gin in my coffee cup. You know I hate gin. It tastes like horse piss. So you think this guy drugged you? I don't think it, Nick. Damn. Why is it so hard for people to believe I'm still off the booze? Hey, whoa, whoa. Relax. It's me, okay? I'm on your side. Yeah. You always were. Look. Um, I'm, uh-- I'm really gonna need your help on this one, kid. You got it. Anything missing? My wallet. My gun. Not a damn thing, as far as I can tell. What about in here? Some weapons, ammo. Security plans for the building. I checked. They're still there. You mind if I take a look anyway? Hey, be my guest. When was the last time you saw these plans? A couple of days ago. A week, maybe. Why? Smell. Look at this. These coffee stains are fresh. Son of a bitch got in. The Valentino Diamond. It's on tour. It's coming tomorrow. You'd better take a look at your security plans. Oh, fat chance. The idiots who run this place are too cheap to change anything. Besides, they'll think I made it all up just to cover my own ass. Hey, hey, hey. There. There he is. That's the guy. There. There. The son of a bitch... came in the building, and he never left. How many ways out of here? Just the front door. Everything else is alarmed. What about where the old guy worked-- the lunch joint? The regular guy was out sick. The regular guy's out sick? The old guy disappears? It's a setup. It's a setup. I'm gonna need your help here, Nicky. I mean, if that rock gets stolen, I'm done. Okay. I'll come by. We'll talk tomorrow. Yeah? Yeah. Good. I thought you had that damn thing figured out. I did. It keeps changing. I'm gonna have to set my alarm for 3:00 a. m. 3:00 a. m. ? What on earth for? They're runningTo Catch a Thief without commercials. It's one of my favorites. Ah, Cary Grant, Grace Kelly, Monte Carlo in the springtime. You know, Hitchcock wanted me to be technical advisor on that. Yeah, but you were busy stealing the Brindisi Emeralds. It paid more, darling. And besides, Count Brindisi was gorgeous. Yeah, but Grace got the prince. Ah,c'est la vie. Why don't I get it. Hmm. Hi, beautiful. Hello. Very nice. You like it? Oh, hello. What's new? "What's new"? Let's see. The stock market's in chaos. My blood pressure's finally leveled out. Michael Jordan might stay with the Bulls. Oh. What more could a man want? I don't know. Maybe the Valentino Diamond. Know anything about it? Uh, 82-karat, blue-white, triple-cut, brilliant, mined in the Transvaal province of South Africa in 1865... by a short man named Raul. Why? Are you buying my Christmas present early? I'll tell you what. I'll get you a lump of coal, and you can squeeze it yourself. Charming. I thought the Valentino was in the Royal Gallery in London. It was. It's on national tour. Really? Hmm. Be a shame if it were missing. Would you relax? Someone is not interested in it. Did Myers put you on this one? No. Good friend of mine's in charge of security. You really don't know anything about it? No. Just the quiet vroom-vroom of my heart. Vroom-vroom, huh? Okay. Well, if you do hear anything, you'll let me know, right? But of course. Okay. Nice bike. - See you later, Lucy. I'm sending no extra men. No overtime, no excuses. Okay. You're the boss. - Gotta get a new battery. - Ah. Do I have to sign this? Can I help whoever's next? Excuse me? Bob Marshall, head of bank security. Can I see your work order? My work order? Sure. Is there a problem, sir? No, no. Just routine. This, uh-- This says "Gary Davis," and your I. D. says "John Thompson. " Yeah. Gary was called out of town. Family emergency. I'm filling in for him. If you want to talk to my dispatcher, I can get him on the phone. - Yeah. Why don't you do that. - No problem. Marshall's over there. Okay. I don't know. What do you think about this one? Amanda, nerves. You've been dating since 1397. Oh, well, knowing my luck, he's gonna be short and old, and he's gonna have warts. So does Robert Redford, but I wouldn't kick him out of bed. Good point. He's here. He's here. Relax. I'll get it. All right. I'll stay here. Fine. Oh, Lucy! We need a signal. Um, give him a glass of wine if he's A-1. And if he's a lox, give him a beer, and I'll go out the window. - Am I overreacting? - Oh, of course not. Okay. I'm Victor Hansen. I hope I'm not too early. No. I would say you're just about perfect. Come in, Mr. Handsome-- Hansen. Please. You can call me Victor. And you can call me anytime you want. Would you like a glass of wine, Victor? Better yet, why don't I open your champagne? Ooh. Why don't you go home, Wolfe? My guys are all over this place. Same reason you don't, Carl. God, I hate this job sometimes. Mmm. I'm off duty now. You? To Marsh. To Marsh. You know, when I was a rookie cop, he was my instructor. "Get a pen, Wolfe. Write this down. You might learn something. Got a pen? Get a pen. " Tried to teach me in six months what he learned in 20 years. He was the best damn cop I knew. Then Phil got shot; he started living on the bottle. Ain't easy losing a partner. I can't believe some crackerjack just took him out. You guys find anything? A couple empty vials. No. He's too smart. This doesn't play. It does if he was drunk. No, he wasn't drunk. He quit drinking two years ago. People fall off the wagon all the time. He didn't, Carl! I know he didn't. Okay. What about the Valentino? What about it? I heard the story. Old guy drugged him. What do you think? I think Marsh was scared to death of losing his job. Now I gotta go tell Beth. I want in on this one, Carl. No. You can't. I owe it to him. And you owe it to him. And you owe it to me. All right. Sorry to keep you waiting. Some things are worth waiting for. So nicely said. Victor, about the gift-- I couldn't possibly accept it. Sure, you can. Okay. Champagne, everyone. - May I? - Please. Lucy. Aren't you meeting your niece at the movies? You know my niece lives in Cleveland. Exactly, darling. Let's see. 12:40. Delivery guy enters bank, goes to Marshall's office. Twenty minutes later, out comes some other guy. No one else in or out except the bank manager. So what the hell is wrong with this picture? Hold it right there. Young guy's shoes. Same shoes as the old delivery guy. If it was a disguise, it's a good one. The guy got what he wanted, and he got away clean. So why was Marsh killed? What would make sense? Next day about 3:15, there's Marsh talking to a repairman. Fifteen minutes later, he's killed in an alley by a crackhead. I don't buy it. The repairman. Give him a ponytail and a mustache, he becomes the other guy. It's the eyes-- same blue eyes, same guy, all three of 'em. Did you really steal Marie Antoinette's tiara? Oh, darling, "steal" is such a common word. I really prefer the term "liberated. " And what about the time you infiltrated the sultan's harem in Constantinople? 1753, I believe it was. I heard that you were his favorite... dancer. Well, at least until I liberated the Star of Allah from him. I was actually in Paris when you liberated the Gutenberg Bible. Moi. Toi. It had to be you. Well, it's a small world. Tell me. How did someone so beautiful get to be so-- Clever? Witty? Faboo? Beautiful. Victor. The motorcycle, the champagne, the flattery, it's wonderful. But my spidey senses are tingling. Let me tell you another way. What the hell do you want with me, Victor? Well, we could begin with the obvious. Ah, not on the first date. Why don't we have some dinner, get to know each other, and then see what happens. Okay. How does Italian sound? I love Italian. All right. So after our espresso and dessert, you can tell me about your plan to "liberate" the Valentino Diamond. Let's see. From what you've told me, it sounds like you could steal that diamond yourself. I'm just a journeyman, Amanda. A general practitioner. Ooh, you can't open a safe, can you? This is a job for a brain surgeon. Oh, Doctor, what lovely bedside manner. To say nothing for the two million dollars you'll get for it on the black market. Princess, this isn't about money. Oh, perish the thought. I'm not gonna sell the Valentino. Really? I'm gonna keep it. I'll pay your half out of my own account. You'll pay me one million dollars from your own account? It's a small price to pay for perfection. Make a wish. You know, it didn't happen this way. Oh, music. Hmm, wonder what we could do now. Now... we dance. Victor, you didn't. Oh. I confess. I did. Do you like it? You've outdone yourself. For you, Amanda, anything. Well, there's this little spot on the coast of Tuscany in Livorno. Don't tell me. La Luna Maria. Oh, I adore it there. Especially the osso buco and the mashed potatoes. With the pesto. Think they deliver? We could try. Maybe I should have a T-shirt made up: "I don't know where she is. " Lucy, I really need to find her. Oh, now honestly, Nick, not a clue. Now I don't mean to be rude, but I have 8,000 shares... to move on the Tokyo market in the next three minutes. No thanks to you. What do you mean, no thanks to me? Well, the money used to flow two ways when she was a thief. Now it only flows one way: out. Fine. I'll wait. Oh, please-- trust me, Nick. You don't want to be here when she gets back. You know, a job like this takes a lot of thinking and planning and blueprints. Take a look at the bike. I promise you won't be disappointed. Ah. A million dollars for one night's work, Amanda. Wow. I haven't had an offer like that since John wanted to make Yoko jealous. Make it a million and a half. How generous of you. It's only money. What else is there? Nick, I promise you I'll have her call you the minute she comes home. Amanda. Nick. Uh, Vic. Vic, Nick. - Hello, Vic. - Hi, Nick. Good-bye, Nick. Good-bye, Vic. Sweet dreams, Amanda. And to think a few short hours ago, you were turning into a fossil. Let's go check my new motorcycle. You're a friend of Lucy's? Isn't everyone? I just met her tonight. Lucy? She's great. Oh, yeah. She's great. Nice lady. Have we met before? No. Although I've been getting a lot of that lately. My mistake. I think so. I just have one of those faces. Huh. One of those faces. Maybe. So? What? What do you mean, "What? " How was it? Well, let's see. The merlot was a little young, the soup was a little salty, and the pasta was not quite as al dente as I'd prefer. Amanda, you know what I mean. How was he? He was nice. Nice? A melon is nice. All right. He was more than nice. He wants me to steal the Valentino Diamond. Are you gonna do it? I fumfered. You fumfered? I didn't say yes; I didn't say no. We could use the money. You said you were bored. You said you were looking for a challenge. I know what I said. A year ago, you would've jumped at the chance. Things are different now. They are? Sure. Maybe. What do you think if-- Ah, forget it. Sure. Whatever you say. Was, uh, Nick waiting long? Long for you, or long for a mere mortal? He was jealous, you know. Of Victor? No. Of the Easter bunny. Amanda, if you're gonna stop being a thief, then do it for you, not for anybody else. Why don't you put a nice pot of coffee on. I think it's gonna be a long and bumpy night. You're gonna do it? Maybe. Maybe. Next time you call me at 5:00 a. m. , I'll have to kill ya. There'll be three sets of prints: Amanda Montrose, Lucy Becker and one more. And that's the one? That's the one. - She in this with him? - No. Nick, I got the ballistics report. Shooter used a style piece: nine-millimeter Baretta with a silencer. When's the last time you heard of a crackhead using a $500 piece, with a silencer? I'll check this out. Get some coffee. Get out. Busy night? You broke into my house. That seems to be going around. Next thing you know, I'll be stealing your garbage. A friend of mine was murdered yesterday. I'm sorry to hear that. What does that have to do with me, Nick? Nothing. Maybe. Remember the security guy I told you about at the bank? So you stole an empty bottle to prove what? That I did it? Sorry. I've got a great alibi. Well, it's your alibi that I'm worried about. Tell me about him. Well, let's see. He's about six feet tall, 185 pounds. - Gives great presents. - What's he do? If you want his r? sum? , why don't you ask him yourself? - What the hell is your problem? - Me? You are the one who broke into my place first. The guy you were with last night-- Victor. Victor. I think he's a murderer. Great. Because I'm going out with someone, he's on your "most wanted" list? You actually think this is about jealousy? Amanda, I don't care if you like this guy or not. I just want you to listen. I'm listening to you. I just don't hear any evidence. He looks like a guy in a surveillance tape. Oh, looks like a guy. He was in disguise. In disguise. Ah. Is that all you have? I'm getting more. You know, it wasn't too long ago you thought I was a murderer. Do you know what this guy wants from you? Do you? You know, you saw us together last night. What do you think he wants? Okay. Once we interrupt the feeds at the main box, we'll have approximately 30 minutes to crack the vault. It's a Kamura 3. 7, so it's not gonna be easy. Am I boring you? Amanda, what's wrong? Did you murder the head of security at the bank yesterday? What? Just answer the question. Okay. No, I didn't murder anyone. There. Feel better? No. Didn't think so. Believe me? Hmm. Didn't think so either. Look. Let's just forget it. You'd just walk away from the Valentino? I don't even own a damn gun. I don't work that way. I'm not evil. I'm not a killer. I'm a thief, like you. People think the worst, but I just didn't expect it from you. Take them. They're yours. There'll be other diamonds, other decades. Too bad. It could've been fun. Victor. Wolfe. Wolfe? Magnus, is that you? Got a hit, but it looks like some kind of a screwup. Wait a minute. I can't hear you. What? Computer says the prints belong to a dead guy. What about the prints? Nick! Nick! Let me call you back. My palms are sweating. My stomach's doing jumping jacks. It's great, isn't it? Yeah. Okay. Let's synchronize watches. Straight up in three, two, one-- Set. Down! I am not her keeper, Nick. I don't know everything she does, and frankly I don't want to. Lucy. Listen to me carefully. I understand you're trying to protect her. So am I. From him. Please. No, Lucy. His name's not Victor Hansen. It's Victor Cole, and he's an Immortal. Yesterday he killed a friend of mine-- Bob Marshall. He was head of security at the bank where the Valentino is. I know you're loyal to her-- He tried to kill me today. He's going to kill her. They're going after the diamond tonight. Thank you. I need to borrow your car. It's in the shop. Where's yours? The engine blew. All right. It'll take 10 minutes to crawl through the ducts... and another two to, uh, open the box. All right. I'll interrupt the power supply at exactly 11:16. You'll have five seconds to override the alarm on the back door. Okay. Let's do it. Amanda. Be careful. Bon chance. Have a good trip. Come on, Victor. Throw the switch. Thank you. Three minutes and counting. Oh, my God. Lucy, this better be good. I told you to never call me at work. Security's disarmed. It's all ours. Perfect timing, Amanda. Come on. We've got 30 minutes to get that vault open. What did I miss? If they were giving Academy Awards for B. S. , Victor, you'd be king of the world. The clock is ticking. Can it wait? No. You told me exactly what I wanted to hear when I wanted to hear it. You have a real gift for that. I thought we worked this out. Please, darling. I don't have time for our Harlequin moments. I knew you were too good to be true. So, Wolfe survived. You know, there's only one thing... that pisses me off more than being made a fool of, and that's having someone try to kill my friends. What's the matter, darling? At a loss for words? I was hoping this would wait until I had the diamond. - Nick, don't! - He's mine! Hey, Vic! Be sure to write. Leave it, Nick! That one's for Marsh. It's up to the dive team now. Good luck finding the body. What are you talkin' about, Wolfe? Where you goin'? Nick! I was doin' us a favor here. Wow. Well, it's amazing what they can do with Bondo these days. It's just a scratch. Be back on the street in no time. Well, it's a good thing you got wheels. What's this? It's yours. A little peace offering. You're kidding? I think the appropriate response would be "Thank you, Amanda. " The headlight's smashed. What is that, a paint chip? You're gonna have to replace that front wheel. Whose fault is that? I didn't come through the door at Mach 4. I was in a rush. A friend of mine was about to get her head chopped off. Are we still friends? Look. Victor-- He came into my life at exactly the wrong time. You know, it's like some great cosmic tumbler just clicked into place, and he was sent in to test me. Some test. Yeah. I failed it. Wasn't the first time. I am sure it won't be the last. No. I'm sure. Come on. Let's go for a ride. - I promise not to go too fast. - I don't break that easily. What? He's out there. He's gonna come back one day. Welcome to my world.
