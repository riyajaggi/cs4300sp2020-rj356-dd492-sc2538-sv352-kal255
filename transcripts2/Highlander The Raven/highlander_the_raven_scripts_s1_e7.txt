 Hey, you picked the wrong house, pal. You have any idea who I am? You want money? Here-- two, three, 300-- 350-- Here, take it all. - It's not enough. - My watch. It cost me 12 grand. Here. More. What do you want? - I want more. - Well, what? You ever hit a ball... when you're in the zone? You watch it leave the pitcher's hand. It crosses the plate, and... wham!

 Right in the sweet spot. - You're the ballplayer. - And you're the D. A. Hey, I was just doing my job. It was the cops that brought the case. It was their call. - It was Wolfe. - Hmm. Nick Wolfe. - That's him. - But you helped. But I can help you now too. Did you read my letters? Letters? Oh, well, sure. Of course. Yeah. The letters. I-I-I-- I read them all. What'd they say? I-I'm sorry. I didn't. You just tell me what you want, okay? Just-- I want my life back. She is immortal. A thousand years old and she cannot die. A creature of legend... like the raven, a thief who stole the sun and the moon. They sent a warrior to bring her back. He found her. Together, they brought back light to the world. I was a cop. To me she was just a thief, another day on the job. But she wasn't-- She changed my life, changed everything. And both of us knew from that moment on, nothing would ever be the same. Hey, buddy! Over here! It's okay. Give him-- There you go. Thank you very much. Have a good day. What are we gonna do this afternoon? Maybe we can go to the... toy store. I hope you don't do this for a living. There. That should do it. How many women do you know... who could make such a complicated meal and still look so good? I think Nick would be more impressed if you got rid of those. The take-out bags? Ah. Mmm. Do you know... how many delivery boys I had to tip? How many times I had to go to the door? The lengths I went to to get this china? The Duke of Marlborough knows. Exactly. Don't you think he would've liked it back? Oh, darling, it doesn't go with his flatware. Ahh. Ahh. All right. Honey, you look exhausted. I am so tired. I'll open some champagne. Good idea. Hmm. You put a tail on me? Man walks down the same street as you, happens to be a cop-- It's a free country. Not now. What's going on here, Carl? - Maybe I'm just trying to protect your ass. - From what? From who. Remember Bonita? Ray Bonita. Ballplayer. Killed his minor-league manager. - I thought you might. - Yeah, first case I caught out of uniform. Yeah, well, Bonita's out. We think he killed Gadson. I'm betting he remembers you. Yeah. I was pissed. - How pissed? - We fought. Hey, man, everybody fought with Jerry. It's the kind of guy he was. - Nobody liked the son of a bitch. - Was I talking to you? So I heard you guys were screaming at each other. You always scream when you fight? Jerry didn't talk, he shouted. I shouted back. I didn't know there was a law against having an argument. There isn't if the other guy walks away. I was pissed, we fought, I left. Where'd you go? For a drive. - For three hours? - I had a lot on my mind. You talk to anybody? You see anybody? - I didn't know I'd need an alibi. - What were you fighting about? - Somebody got something wrong. - I bet. You know what they found in Jerry's desk this morning? A list of the Mets' hand signals? No. Drug tests. You're, uh, turning on your heel. It's messing with your follow-through. When a player tests positive for cocaine, it throws the screws on a promising career. Look, you got it all wrong. I tell you what. Let's go downtown. You can help me get it right. It's a waste of time. I'll get my stuff. Hey, buddy. What's going on? Columbo here thinks Ray killed Jerry. That's crazy. Yeah, I tried to tell him. Then he's got nothin' to worry about. Listen, if I'm not back by 6:00, call Angie. You got it. Hey, that's not mine. Put your hands behind your back. What? Do it! What are you doin'? Look, I swear to God, man. That is not mine. I did not do this! Hey, call Angie, will ya? Yeah, you got it. Hey, we're gonna get you a good lawyer, all right? We'll get you out of this. Darryl, I didn't do it. I know, buddy. I know. You got some killer on the loose, and you put a rookie to keep an eye on me? - Hey, some people might appreciate the thought. - I want to see his jacket. - It's confidential. - Captain, you want to sign this? Tell Sergeant Vocono I want his ass out on the street today. Carl, when were you gonna let me know? Before or after I'm laying on the concrete? I'm waiting for the prints. We don't know... if it's him for sure-- You were waiting for the prints before you tell me? Don't tell me how to do my job. I'm not telling you how to do your job, Carl. You got a D. A. down. You're using me as bait. I want to see the jacket. You're a civilian, Nick. Leave this to the department. Wouldn't look so good, would it-- "Ex-cop Solves Case. " People might wonder why he's an "ex. " Questions you don't want to answer. Okay. I am going to go out now. And I am going to have a good time. I don't know where I'm going, but-- never to worry-- wherever it is, he's going to be very rich, Prince! and he's going to be very handsome. The actor. And he's gonna own a watch. Did you know, Lucy, that I have not been stood up... since Winston Churchill had to order D-Day? That wasn't his fault. So Eisenhower said. And he apologized. Hey, over here! Ma'am. Ooh. So dependable. - I know you. - I apologize. - Mmm? For what? - Being late. Late for, uh-- Lunch. Lunch! Oh, my God. Was that today? Tsk. What were you-- 20, 30 minutes late? - Three hours. - Wow, something must have really gone wrong... for you to be three hours late. Nothing went wrong. Nothing went wrong? Nothing's wrong. All right. See ya around. - Amanda-- - Yep. - Some other time? - Sure. Something wrong? Why do you ask? Well, at least we have civilized rules of engagement. "Civilized"? Right. Oh, you think there's a difference? It's a personal thing. I put the guy in prison. He's pissed. Oh. All right. So it's okay because he's angry. Forget it. Anyone hungry? Look, maybe I can help you. I can handle it. This is a personal thing, Amanda. And don't give me any of your... "I'm an immortal; I can't be killed" B. S. Okay, what about, uh, "What a testosterone-based macho idiot I am" B. S. ? Look, the guy's not gonna go away. He's gonna come, and he's gonna keep coming until you're dead. - Believe me. I know a lot about grudges. - Then I'll find him first. Oh. City of five million-- Piece of cake. It'd be a lot easier if I had my notes. You don't remember? It was a long time ago. It was six years. Six years ago. Wow. There goes the short-term. - There's a lot of details. - I remember every dish... in a 17-course dinner at Versailles, right down to thefilet de li??vre Londonier. - And that was 250 years ago. - Really? Congratulations. Doesn't help. - All right. Where's the file? - Magnus's office. No problem. - No! - Yes. What do you think, I'm out of practice? The poster child for robbery/homicide. Signs everywhere... say, "Arrest this woman. " Cindy Crawford's not as popular down there. Cindy Crawford isn't as talented. - No can do. They know you too well. - And they don't know you, former Detective Wolfe? Have a seat. You go. I'll lock up. I still got to change. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Connie? Who's there? It's me! Angie! I could've killed you. What did they do to you? Very pretty! How do you like that, sweetie, huh? Welcome! They won't do it again. I'm sorry I scared you. But I had to make sure that you were alone. Cops were already here. I know. Oh. Did you do it, Ray? Ray? Oh! Pardon me if I ask a silly question, but why don't you just get out of town? Amanda has this great little place in the Bahamas. You could go there for a couple of months. She might even come with you. Little golf, midnight swims, couple of bottles of champagne by the sea. Why is it when the going gets tough, you want to go on vacation? It is the wisdom that comes with years, my dear. Look. It looks like Ray had a girlfriend, and his best friend is a Darryl Keenan. Darryl Keenan, the pitcher? Yeah, who just signed for 30 million plus incentives. - Boy, did I get in the wrong career. - Son of a bitch. So you don't want to go away. So don't go. I'm sorry I mentioned it. No, Lucy. Ray took a drug test when he was in prison. He was clean. - So, what do you got for me? - Morris murder. Drug test, blood fragments from the bat. Nice. Nice job. Man, I nailed that son of a bitch. Can you believe he's still screaming he's innocent? Ah, they all do. Public defender's probably trying to get him to cop a plea. So, tell me. How does it feel? Great. It feels great. So? So, it's impossible. It's Darryl Keenan! Been a while. You bet. Thanks for coming. Good to see ya. Hey, there. Can I have your autograph? You're awesome. Thank you. Yeah, my name's John, Mr. Keenan. Thanks. Oh, man. You know, I had it all worked out for you. Now you're gonna have the police force after you. So let 'em find me. I just don't get it. I mean, you got a nice little job in my organization. Yeah, like this scar's gonna match a suit? I suppose this is where you tell me I ought to see the other guy, right? He's dead. So how's the arm? Mmm, still tight. Those sons of bitches, they got me training in the off-season. Hell, I figure it's their nickel, right? I'm just a working stiff. - Well, you got to stay in shape. - Ray? What did you have to kill the guy for? I would have worked it out. 'Cause nobody screws with Ray Bonita. Not anymore. "Plead manslaughter," the public defender tells me. "You'll do six years, come out a young man," she tells me. Too bad she didn't tell me about the animals that come for you in the middle of the night. But I learned. Somebody takes something from you, you take it right back, or you're meat. And that bastard took my life. Well, that bastard was a D. A. He was a liar. Look, I just want to help, okay? Tell me what you need. Just let me know what I can do. I want to see the show. How 'bout the time you struck out Boggs three times in a row? Damn. You saw that? And the night you ended the Yankees' streak? Ah, just got lucky, I guess. Come on. There were shadows all over that field. Man, you're in the show. Hey. You'd have been in it too, Ray. Hey, come on. Just let me help you, buddy. You know what they're paying me. Damn mayor, he's giving me a key to the city. Shoot. I'm kicking some pretty serious butt here. Doesn't matter. Ray? Where can I find Darryl Keenan? Thank you, Santa. It's him. Hey, you stay cool. Okay, we're in it together. Don't! Don't do this, Ray. Time for you to get lost, Darryl. You kill this man, you take me with you. What are you talking about, man? I'm gonna be a witness. Look, they're gonna give me a choice. I put away my best friend, or I lose everything. Ray, please. Just... let me handle him, all right? Darryl Keenan-- I'm a big fan. - Nick Wolfe. - Nice to meet you. Yeah. You seen Ray Bonita? No, sir, I haven't. You know he's out. Yeah. Yeah, I know that. Oh, yeah. Well, did you read the papers, or-- Yeah. Yeah. Really? What makes you think he'd come here? Well, you never missed a day of his trial. Well, neither did you. You're the cop who arrested him. You're his best friend. Didn't know that was a crime. Known each other since you were kids. Yeah, well, you know he's been in jail, right? Could have lost touch. You paid for his lawyers. Look, I don't know how you treat friends where you come from. Where I come from, you help a friend who's in trouble. Well, you send his girlfriend a check every month. Yeah. She's a nice girl. It's not her fault. You called over there yesterday. Hey. Come on, Darryl. Look, if anybody knows where Ray is, it's you. You wanna help me out here? Look, I don't mean you any disrespect, but you are the man who put him away. Well, maybe I was wrong. What the hell's that supposed to mean? Maybe he was innocent. Say what? Maybe we should reopen this case. Really? Why? You got some new evidence or something? Or something. Don't do this to me. Don't do what? Look, I know he was your friend, but this guy's in trouble, and just maybe I can help him. He's got a gun. He wants you dead. A lot of people do. Where is he? He's in the locker room. Ray, don't! I just want to talk to you. You took my life once! You wanna try it again? I saw the drug tests. The ones you did in prison. I told you! I saw the letter you wrote the D. A. - I told all of you! - When Jerry died, you were clean. I was innocent! - I was wrong. - It's too late. No, it's not too late. I killed the D. A. But not Jerry. Don't make things worse. Think they'll let me go? If they catch you out on the street, they'll kill you. I don't care. I screwed up. Six years ago, I was wrong. Let me fix it. There is no hope for me. You'll be alive. Prison is not living. You set me up? You bastard! So, great. You've retired. - It's still my case. - You broke into my office! You stole my files! You start a shootout in the mayor's favorite tourist attraction. - What the hell are you doing? - Getting answers. You're not a cop, Wolfe. He didn't do it. Didn't do what? Didn't kill his manager. That's funny. I don't see a dead manager. I see a dead D. A. We got the wrong-- I got the wrong guy. You made your bones on that case. Well, maybe I shouldn't have. The case is closed. Nothing's closed. He's still out there. Not for long. You got a problem with it? Talk to a priest. I already spoke to the cops... and the D. A. 's office. You haven't talked to me. We can do it here, or we can go downtown. Haven't seen him. Hasn't called. Don't know where he is. Murder, attempted murder-- He's in a lot of trouble, Angie. He gets caught out on the street, he's dead. He's not a monster. You don't know him. Nobody does. Do you know what it's like to be 21 and so much in love that it hurts? It's been a while. And he loves you so much... that he'll stop an entire game on a summer night in July to wave at you. Just to let everyone know you're his. That he'll go hungry when his team's on the road... because he spent his meal money talking to you on the pay phone. That's how much he loved me. He was innocent, and it didn't matter. You put him away; you find him. You're not helping him. You want to put my ass in jail, you do that. Look, I'm not going to arrest you. You're not a cop? If he hurts a cop, if he so much as touches Nick Wolfe, the cops are gonna be the least of his problems. Who are you? You tell him if you see him, no one forgets when you kill a D. A. You tell him to start running and keep running. And my advice to you-- Don't go with him. Get out of town, Ray. She's right. You stay here, they'll get you for sure. Hi! I couldn't get in to the manicurist, so I-- Fascinating. Nick-- Mu business, my life, Amanda. He wants you dead. Then that makes it between him and me. You want me to go? No. No, I'm going with you. No, no. I mean, that's-that's totally crazy. Look, she called in sick today. Let's talk. I waited six years, Ray. Angie, they get me, they get you too. Six years! Do you think I'm going back to waiting? We got nothing. It takes money to run. Darryl's got money. Stay out of this, Amanda. Look, some things you can't change, Nick. That is not the same person you put away. He is a murderer. Whatever he is, I made him that way. So, what, you're God now? What else do you feel responsible for? He was a kid with a life and a future. I don't expect you to understand. Why not? Because I'm immortal or a thief or a woman? What don't I get? All of the above. I owe him. So him putting bullet holes through you is gonna make it right? Huh? You know, I wouldn't have come, but-- Hey, it's okay, buddy. Remember when we were kids? You know, you taught me to throw my first curve. You remember. Hell, yeah. Still your best pitch. You know, I'm real sorry. About what? About all this. It's not your fault. Yeah, it is. Oh, man. He was crazy, you know. I tried to reason with him, but he wouldn't listen. He just wanted me dead. He was my best friend. He pulled his gun on me, so I had to shoot. I had to. Six years ago, one spot available... on a major-league roster: two players good enough to get it. Circumstantial. Darryl Keenan did it. Why won't you look at this? What, are you afraid of pissing off someone downtown? In two hours, the mayor's giving the key to the city to Keenan, and I'm gonna wrap it in a bow for him. You know what, Carl? I think you stopped being a cop long before I did. - Get out. - Keenan didn't kill Ray Bonita. We did. We followed procedure. We were wrong. Hey. You lied to me. Do you realize if you'd have told me the truth, that Ray was in there, he still might be alive today? Yeah, I might have told you, and you might have walked in that bar, and he might have blown you away. Oh, that's right. You're not big on the truth. What's so great about the truth, Nick? You want to know what's so great about the truth? For some of us, it's all we got. Really? What the hell good is the truth if it gets you killed? Evidence? Is that the truth? Evidence convicted Ray. Was that the truth? I'll tell you what the truth is. Only two guys on that team were A-negative blood type. Like the drug test. Ray Bonita and his best buddy. Darryl Keenan. And one of 'em's nailed for murder. And one made the big leagues. And one of 'em's lying. And one of 'em's talking. And he's dead. Not necessarily. Oh, you're gonna tell me he's immortal? I'm sorry, Amanda, but not all of us get that privilege. You know what I like about the truth, Nick? What? Sometimes the best way to get it is to lie. Maybe this old thing. Sorry, ma'am. Ray never mentioned you. That's funny. He told me a lot about you. He told me he was gonna marry Angie. Well, how's this for, uh, a little pillow talk? I'm sorry, ma'am. They got Ray for that. You're right. They did. They put him in jail. Lucky for you. Tell me, Darryl, what is the difference between... a man and D. N. A. ? - I don't know. - D. N. A. never lies. You ain't got a thing. Oh, no. I got a lot of things. I got a drug test, and I got a swatch from a friend's baseball bat. Cops closed the case. And I got a good old boy who should have quit cocaine. Closed it twice. You know, what about those tabloids? Because, you know, inquiring minds do like to know. I got pictures of me at the White House. Hell-- I'm with the president. I know. I saw that. Who dressed you for that, anyway? Tell me, Darryl, how are the endorsements doing-- the shoe company? Oh, is that what you want? Why not? Ray earned it. Let's see. Three, four-- - Thousand. - Million. Four. You know what? I think we ought to go five. Five million dollars. Want to go higher? What'd you think I'd done-- just fell off the turnip truck? Not at all. I think you just got 30 million without endorsements. You pay an agent, a publicist, a lawyer, an accountant. I don't think they're gonna miss my little old cut. Do you think I worked my whole life... - to pay it over to some stupid tramp? - Excuse me? Do you think a guy that solves the problems that I have is an idiot? Oh, you're talking about the drug thing. Right. They caught you on a really bad day, so you switched yours for Ray's. That stupid cop who just kept asking questions-- - I wouldn't go there if I were you. - I can go anywhere I want to! I'm Darryl Keenan. You want five million dollars? You want five million dollars, you go find it under a rock. Golly, Officer. She broke in. She was half crazed from killing her boyfriend. Came right at me. Nice swing. Use that on Jerry? Oh, you figured it out. What else was I gonna do? Tell the truth. It was a little late for that, now wasn't it? Ray wasn't supposed to serve time. See, I had it all figured out every step of the way. That case wasn't gonna hold water. Except he goes and pleads to manslaughter. Stupid hayseed. Must have been to trust you. Tsk. All right. Go ahead and shoot me. 911. This is Darryl Keenan. What's your location? I'm at 143 Walnut. I'd like to report a b-- a break-in and shooting. Are you all right, sir? Yeah, I'm okay now. We're on our way. Thanks. Ah, she ain't going anywhere. Get it? Again? You'll like this one. It's got a good beat. You can dance to it. Except he goes and pleads to manslaughter. What is it? It's Ray's eulogy. Sleep well. You want five million dollars? Go ahead and shoot me. I'm Darryl Keenan. Here you go. Darryl Keenan arraignment tomorrow. His fans have already set up a defense fund. Still, you did it. Sure did. Took a pretty nice guy with a hell of a swing... and turned him into a-- a what? Everybody knows better. Angie knows. Half the ball club showed up to his funeral. You did everything you could do. It wasn't enough. Someone died because I made a mistake. Would you please stop? What? Expecting yourself to be more than human. Spoken by someone who is. We're all the products of our histories. Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, but he still owned slaves. Is there a point to this? The best people I've known didn't always do the right thing. They just wanted to. Tell me it gets easier after the first thousand years. Closed-Captioned By Captions, Inc. , Los Angeles Subtitles ripped by Ziina
