 Get in! Okay, easy. Now, then, are you okay? Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing? All right. Put it down. Put it down. Slowly. Don't do anything stupid. Like what, body snatching? We didn't do this, Nick. - I don't know you. - You're not supposed to. My name is Joe Dawson. She is immortal. A thousand years old and she cannot die.

 A creature of legend... like the raven, a thief who stole the sun and the moon. They sent a warrior to bring her back. He found her. Together, they brought back light to the world. I was a cop. To me she was just a thief, another day on the job. But she wasn't-- She changed my life, changed everything. And both of us knew from that moment on, nothing would ever be the same. Whiskey neat, as I recall. You first, and make it good.

 Amanda, will you tell him that I'm not the bad guy? He's not the bad guy. Is it a Watcher? A what? - Nothing. - What the hell is a Watcher? - Sorry. - Oh, come on. Jeff Case is the name of the man who died. His wife's name is Marilyn. His father and I have been friends for over 20 years. - And? - And that's all I can say. Hey, Collins. Yeah. Nick Wolfe. Who's on Homicide tonight? You don't want to do that. Yeah, I do. We should just tell him. Joe is a Watcher too. Okay, just explain to me exactly what it is you do. We observe and record Immortal activity, and we pass it along from generation to generation. Uh-huh. And dispose of bodies in the middle of the night sometimes. Sometimes. Strange career choice. It's not a choice. It's a privilege. For some, it's passed on father to son. For me, it was a chance meeting-- an Immortal that saved my life in Vietnam. - If you are interested. - Oh, by all means. See, someday the Immortals will be gone. People need to know they were here, their part in our history. And that is the gig. Okay, I'll play your game here. How long has this group, organization, club, whatever you call yourself-- - How long have you been around? - Four thousand years, give or take. Four thousand years. And you watch her too? Look, Watchers are sort of a necessary evil, kind of like mosquitoes. Every once in a while you have to swat one away, but most of the time, you just get used to it. Gee, thanks. No problem. All right. What are you doing here, Joe? Following someone who was following you. Andre Korda. Nicely done. - Who are you? - I am he who has the honor of deciding your fate. In your dreams. I am at your mercy. I have shown you the power of surrender. Just do it! And if I don't? I would be very grateful. I have been looking for someone like you for years. There are two kinds of beings, Amanda. Sparrows and hawks. Immortals are the hawks. The others exist for the sole purpose of feeding us. And the sparrows who live here with you-- do they know? What we are? No. Although they did see me die once. It made quite an impression. They look upon me as... a divinity. Personally, I'm not into godhood. Ha. You get used to it. You stay on holy ground, let others take care of what needs to be done. It is the best of all possible worlds. And you're willing to share? I'm flattered. Mortals are so-- Temporary? Let us say that I prefer the company of my own kind. Look at you. You are beautiful. You are clever. And you are a survivor. I've done all right for a girl my age. I'd do even better if you showed me how to use those knives. The Flying Rainbow? I learned to fight alongside the 10 Tigers of Kwangtung. It would be an honor to teach you. I'd be willing to learn. This is not the work of a week or a month, Amanda. This is the discipline of a lifetime. You must learn to use your whole body as your weapon. Resistance is useless. You yield, or you die. If a cat bites your hand, the more you pull away, the deeper it sinks its teeth in. But if you let your hand go limp, the cat lets go. Your enemy is defeated. Remember, Amanda. Suppleness without strength, agility without force... and surrender without resistance. What a team we shall make, you and I. I can't imagine Andre Korda even remembering me. Well, one of my people is dead around the corner. His memory must be improving. Listen, if you can point out the shooter, I'll bring him in. It's a cop thing he does. Yeah, I thought so. - Ex-cop. - It's a long story. The short version is, I ruined his life. So what's Korda doing here? Besides extortion, theft and kidnapping, he's running a new nightclub. He calls it the Sanctuary. See? I don't know why you insisted on coming. Hey, I love the nightlife. I gotta boogie. Sweet. I know you think you can protect me, but it's a delusion. Amuse me. Goodies! Are there more where this came from? Regretfully not. We had to burn the village to the ground. You burned the whole village to the ground? They refused to pay the tithe. Resistance. It is a perfect illustration. You're not bothered? Me? No, no. You're lying. I love that. Resistance, Amanda. It is useless. You either yield-- I understand. Can I leave now? No, Amanda. No one ever leaves me. I hate it when you sneak up on me like that. It is now time. For tea? For your first test. I thought we already handled that. In the classroom. Not in real life. I see. To practice discipline, precision and mastery in a controlled environment... is one thing. To keep one's head in the thick of battle is entirely another. Keep one's head? Yes, that's a good inside joke. Where are you from, Amanda? Which century? Your first one. Oh, so long ago. Well, I was raised by royalty. Naturally. Stop, thief! - Yes, my father was a duke. - Stop her! Stop her! And I guess you could say that basically... we had the best of everything. So you have no experience at being a thief? Thief? No. Perish the thought. This will be an adventure then. The neighboring village has a temple. Tomorrow, at noon precisely, you will storm this temple with my men. Noon? The temple will be full of worshippers. Won't that be a bit inconvenient? Exactly. - And this is your plan? - It is the perfect distraction. Chaos, confusion and disorder, in the midst of which you descend upon the scattering sparrows, and you empty the temple of its precious relics. And the people will just smile and thank us? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But one thing is certain-- They will learn the futility of resistance. You will see to that. Aren't you afraid I'd run off with the booty? Since you came to me, Amanda, I have watched you blossom... like this flower. Should you choose to leave my sacred garden... without the nourishment of my counsel, you would perish. The choice is yours. Life or death. Charming. What are you gonna say to him? No hard feelings? Twelve hundred years to practice your groveling, that's the best you can do? Thanks for your support. No problem. She's beautiful. She's becoming an inconvenience. The guy with her? He's the one who interfered today. You think he'll recognize you? Don't know. Well, why don't you go down there and find out? He looks lonely. And if he does? We're here to raise cash to finance our operation. Nothing gets in the way of that. Korda's waiting for you. Well, that's because I'm worth it, darling. Amanda. Hi. Hi. I'm Crysta, and I'm just what the doctor ordered. What do you think? I think I liked you in orange better. I have missed you. How long are you in town? This is not my only club. I have one in Paris and another in Rio. Korda, what are you doing in my neighborhood? Slumming. Well, I thought maybe you had something to tell me. Like what? Like there can be only one. Look at you. Still resisting. You find what you're looking for? Not yet. Her name is Crysta, and she will do absolutely anything for me. Why don't you tell me about you? Are you still murdering innocent women and children? A shame you never had the stomach for that. You left me and never even said good-bye. I know it was rude, but you were sleeping so soundly. Because you drugged me. By the way, what has happened to my beautiful rainbow fan? Oh, that old thing. It's around somewhere, maybe in a closet. Keep it. And in return? My original offer still stands, Amanda. Join me. You and I could have such fun together. And what about Bambi? Crysta? The more, the merrier. Oh, how original. No matter how many of those you surround yourself with, you're still alone. Your little sparrow will have to be eaten. I must tell you-- he doesn't respond to verbal commands very well. Is that a gun in your pocket? I hate to disappoint you, but, uh, yeah. What line of work are you in? Pest control? If you weren't so cute, I'd swear you were a cop. Well, if you weren't so cute, I'd swear you were a murderer. You lost it. A hundred years later, and the offer is still open. And my answer is still no. Holy ground, Korda. Never heard of foreplay? Just know, Amanda, that this time... I will kill you. Gas main's broken. You'll have to detour. No problem. You know Maple? Won't take long if you go that way. Thanks. Anytime. We're taking a detour. Want to call it in for me? No problem. Got you covered. Oh, my God. I think I hit someone. Stay in the truck! Buddy. Are you okay? Damn! Oh, my God. Please. Please don't shoot. Back away. 3:14 p. m. Korda hits an armored car and shoots two men. - Go! Go! - But you're hit. - You were sloppy. - We don't need Amanda. We need what I say we need! And if she won't play? Convince her. I'll be right back. What do you want, Wolfe? Two guards were shot. The one who lived said he put two bullets in one of the thieves as he got away. Well... chalk one up for truth and justice. Oh, not quite. A mile away, the armored vehicle goes off a bridge and explodes in a ball of flames. Sounds like a hell of a ride. The funny thing is, when the salvage team gets there, there's no bodies. No money, no evidence. All washed out to sea. Department says case closed, but you and I know better, don't we? That's one possibility. That'sthepossibility. Who do we know that can take two bullets and survive flaming wreckage? One in the stomach and one in the shoulder. You saw. I called the ambulance. - How's he doing? - How's he doing? How's he doing? Let's see. His name is Fred Regan. His wife's name is Helen. The hospital won't say, which is usually a very bad sign. It was Korda. Let's go. Forget it. You're a witness. Let's go. I'm a Watcher. Hey, close enough. I can't interfere. Yes, you can. - I took a vow! - I don't care. Break it! Is that what you say to a priest who's trying to protect the secrecy of the confessional? That's what I say to a priest who's trying to protect a murderer. In 4,000 years, do you know how many people have died trying to protect this secret? That's your problem. No, it wasn't a date, okay? Just because two people go out dancing doesn't mean that it's a date. Quit putting words in my mouth. Um, Lucy? Uh, I need to call you back. Okay. Bye-bye. Well, well, well, Let me guess. Youaren't the encyclopedia salesman. Oh. You should have told me you were coming. I would have prepared tea. I would have made those little sandwiches. By the way, where do they grow watercress? Amanda? Yes? I don't think we've been properly introduced. Was it something like Tiffany? Crysta. How quaint. Raphael and I have a message for you from Korda. Is it one of those singing telegrams? - You have 12 hours to make up your mind. - Twelve hours? One for every century that you've lived. If I don't, do I turn into a pumpkin? No, sweetheart. You turn into a memory. Bye, Igor. Or is it "Eegor"? Oh, Crysta, by the way, how long have you been with Korda? - Eight years. - Is that dog years? Because he gets bored at the end of every century. Hello? Joe, I'm kind of busy right now. What? Hey, you can't come in here-- Let's go, Korda. You got a warrant? Oh, yeah, right here. This is a very bad career move, I think. It's your day of judgment, pal. Don't look alarmed, girls. I'll be back soon. Don't count on it. Whatever you think you've got on me, it won't hold up. You haven't even read me my rights. Guess what. You've killed two men. You haven't got any. Leave him alone, Nick. Not this time. Ladies, don't fight over me, please. Prison is not for Immortals. -Who said anything about prison? -Would you please share with the class? I know where they're pouring a foundation for a new building. He'll make a wonderful cornerstone. In a hundred years, he'll be somebody else's problem. All right. Amanda! I checked him out. He's not a cop. What? Can't trust anybody these days. You had to mess with the car! Nope. You can't blame Amanda. For a minute I thought we were at a Colombian soccer match. - And you would be? - Her fairy godfather. Are we dancing, or are we gonna sit this one out? Put the sword down, Amanda. You don't want your friend to die. - One. - What are you doing, Korda? - Looks like he's playing poker. - Two. I don't bluff. Oh, what the hell. Three. - Shoot the girls. - No, wait. Just-- Get out. See, Amanda? You really should have taken me up on my offer. Good evening, ladies. Were you trying to get yourself killed? Oh, I'm sorry, Amanda. You had a plan? Nick, I have to do this. You do not have to do this. Because you say so. Your life is short enough. Why do you insist on getting involved in my world? The minute he commits murder, he steps into my world. Joe, talk to him. I cannot talk to you. You know, I think she likes you. You shut up. Tell me, were you really gonna bury Korda in cement? I don't get it, Dawson. Where's your spine? How can you just sit there and watch? Faith. Oh, come on. Faith in what? Rolling heads? I believe we're all here for a purpose, even Immortals. See, if I come forward, I blow their cover and ours. They either put me in a psycho ward, or worse yet, they believe me. And then... open season on Immortals. That's a pretty big leap. Hmm. Tell me, how long were you a police officer? Twelve years. Oh, so then you know. People get scared. They shoot first, ask questions later. Human nature at its finest. You're showing a lot of faith, Dawson. Do you think I care if they kill Korda? No. But what about Amanda? What happens when they come after her? You know, they used to burn witches at the stake. So Korda walks. Maybe. Maybe not. Not. Hmm. I tell you-- I've been a Watcher a long time, and there are no guarantees of happy endings. Korda? I should go with you. The situation in Paris is dicey right now. People are asking questions. Schedules are changing by the hour. Yes, but I don't like it when you go without me. That's sweet. But you see, it really doesn't matter what you like or what you don't like. You need to show me what a good girl you can be. Do you understand? Mr. Wolfe has been a continuous thorn in my side, so what's your job, sweetheart, hmm? To take care of him. That's my girl. See what a great team we are? Oh, well. Why don't you just make yourself at home? What am I gonna do with him? You could always try killing him. What do you want him to do, Amanda? I-- I just want him to stay out of my business. He sees a bad guy, he wants to do something about it. And it's obvious that this is personal with him. Why? Because he doesn't like the way Korda dresses. Because of you. I am immortal. I keep telling him that, and he just won't get it through his thick head. He could get killed. He could. You think he doesn't know that? Then why does he keep doing this? I see him; I see you. Then what am I gonna do about it? Get used to it? Wow. Maybe you should give the bag a woman's name, like Mary or Gwendolyn... or anybody you might be angry with. I don't think you really want me to do that. Yeah? What if I put on some gloves and we went a few rounds? Don't worry, Amanda. I'm not gonna go to the press or the police or anybody. Your secret's safe with me. Nick. Amanda. I know this is costing you a lot. You're driving me crazy. You didn't ask for this. I know. It's just happening. I guess it's fate. I don't believe in fate. Oh, you have to. Otherwise nothing makes any sense at all. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Imagine running into you here. It's a regular Girl Scout meeting. Why don't we go someplace more comfy, and we'll get this over with? I didn't come for you. You have to go through me to get to him. Fine. Whatever you say. - Not here. - Hmm. Amanda. Amanda! Amanda! Hey! Where is she? Not here. Answer me, Dawson. Where is she? What happened? I'm sorry, Nick. You're sorry? What do you mean, you're-- She, uh... wanted you to have this. You're some piece of work. You know that? Hey, I'm just the delivery boy. She was supposed to live forever. Well, it happens. It's no different for her than for the rest of us. She came to see me. I warned you, Nick. No guarantees. No happy ending. - Where's Korda? - Just forget about it. Listen to me! You tell me where the hell Korda is! Monsieur? Give this to Suliman. Put it into his hands and tell him there'll be twice as much when the job is done. I had a call from the States. She's dead. This coffee's stale. Get me another cup. It's done. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm quite sure. I didn't know I was such a good liar. Thank you, Joe. Don't thank me. I feel like hell. So how did he take it? What, do you want a blow-by-blow description? Just forget it, Amanda. He's gonna be fine. He'll get over it. Well, next time do him a real favor-- run over him with a truck. Look, it wouldn't have worked anyway. Sparrows and hawks. Say what? I'd be spending so much time worrying about him, I would end up losing my own head. Once more with feeling, Amanda. Whose life were you worried about? It's better that he thinks I'm dead. We can all just get on with our lives. Ou est Korda? Ou est Kor-- Ou est-il? May I help you? You speak English. Mm-hmm. Good. Where's Korda? He's not here. He's not here? Mm-mmm. What, is he back here? Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing? You need to leave! I'm in a really bad mood. Now, you tell Korda Nick Wolfe is looking for him. He can find me at de Gaulle Hotel. You understand? # I thought you'd live forever # Yeah # I thought you'd live forever # Yeah - Amanda? Hey! Hey! Amanda! Sorry. Mon amour. # I thought you'd live forever # Yeah, oh-oh-oh I should admire your persistence, but I won't. We're going to kill you instead. Put him out of my misery and get rid of the body. Will you take it easy? Don't tell me to take it easy. He's probably alive. They're gonna find him in one of those hospitals. That's not good enough. I can't find my cosmetic case. What did she do with my cosmetic case? I can't find my stiletto. Did you know you are absolutely useless? You want me to lie to you? I'm the expert at it. Look, I want you to tell me what Nick was doing in Paris. Korda? Yeah, that's what they tell me. - That's ridiculous. - You think you know someone. I saw the two of you together for all of five minutes, and I could've won a bet on this! Just shut up, Joe. # I thought you'd live forever What are you gonna do? I'm gonna go to Paris. # Yeah # Ohh Closed-Captioned By Captions, Inc. , Los Angeles Subtitles ripped by Ziina
