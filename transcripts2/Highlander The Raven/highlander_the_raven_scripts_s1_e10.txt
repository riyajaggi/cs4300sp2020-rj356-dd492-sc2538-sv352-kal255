 One more. No, no, no, no, no. Why don't you go back to your La-Z-Boys? Do I follow you around? Oh! Mr. Geary, please! Bye, Mr. Geary! Oh, great. Let me guess. A fan? Oh. Even worse-- a critic. The second act was a little slow. But you gotta love the-- I am starting to take this personally. Who the hell are you? and raise your hands slowly! I'll take the sword. She is immortal. A thousand years old and she cannot die. A creature of legend...

 like the raven, a thief who stole the sun and the moon. They sent a warrior to bring her back. He found her. Together, they brought back light to the world. I was a cop. To me she was just a thief, another day on the job. But she wasn't-- She changed my life, changed everything. And both of us knew from that moment on, nothing would ever be the same. Lady, do you mind if I ask you what the hell you were doing? Yes, actually, I do mind. Book this guy for stealing an old lady's purse on 12th Street. And bathe him! Lucy? What the hell's going on? Leave it alone, Nick. They wanna charge you with attempted murder? If there's no body, there's no murder, and no one's gonna show up to press charges, okay? Can I talk to her just-just one second? - Yeah. -Okay. Lucy, I'm not the enemy, okay? If there's a problem, you can talk to me. I can handle it, Nick. With a gun and a sword? I mean, either you were out hunting elephants, or somebody's after Amanda. Amanda knows nothing about this, and I wanna keep it that way, okay? How can you pretend nothing happened? Nothing did happen. Excuse me. How am I supposed to practice my fan when you're disturbing my chi? And what "nothing" just happened? She spent the night in jail playing pinochle with Big Edna. Thank you very much. Jail? Lucy, I thought maybe you got lucky with Roberto or something. I don't even like Roberto. She went for a midnight stroll with a gun. Well, a girl can't be too careful these days. And a sword. Lucy! He's back, isn't he? Yes. He's back. They loved you, Lucy. Lucy, Marco, say cheese! Amanda. Marco! Thank you. How long's it been? Oh. Rio? Saint-Tropez. Nude beach. Well, not until you got there. Well, I've always been a trendsetter. Hey, I had no idea you were in town. I'm here for a couple of days. Why don't you stay with us? Oh. I'm-I'm sorry. Amanda, I would like you to meet my leading lady and my wife, Lucy. Marco, you little heartbreaker, what got into you? Well, it looks like you two have some catching up to do. I'll see you later. It was nice meeting you, Amanda. Lucy. Uh, I should-- Yes, you should. Lucy. She's an Immortal, isn't she? So? And she's beautiful. And so are you. Can't you see you're the one I love? For now. But I'm not gonna live forever. Shh. I'm gonna be all right. You go back to your party. Oh, boy. That was smooth. She thinks you're competition. I hope you told her that we were together over 100 years ago. You're beautiful and you're immortal. We had that springtime in Paris, and she knows I still remember. You have such a poet's soul. Uh, I should go after her. You know what? Let me. Okay? Okay. See you in a bit. If it makes you feel any better, you could shoot me. You'd just get up again. You slept with him. So much for small talk. Life's too short. At least, for some of us. Do you really wanna know? Yes. No. I already do. You know, he's really proud of you. Your performance tonight was magnificent. It was beautiful. Marco's words. Ah, no, darling. Your voice, it was-- it was magic. Did you love him? Maybe, uh, a very long time ago. Long for whom? Lucy, I'm not the competition. - Aren't you? - No. He loves you. You won. I'm happy for you both. I'll be back. Wilson. How long has it been, Amanda? I think the Old Globe, and I probably was the only one notthrowing tomatoes. It was the writer's fault. Oh. Always is. Mm-hmm. Be good. Mmm. Come on. You are much too pretty to be sad. Please. Wrong time, wrong place. Oh. Story of my life. What is it with me? What? I mean, why do I kid myself that someone like you might be interested in me? I'm married. And he let you come in here alone? Oh, what fools these mortals be! Oh, God. Another actor. That's what my ex-agent said. - Can I ask you a favor? - Sure. I have this audition tomorrow. Yet each man kills the thing he loves. By each, let this be heard. The coward does it with a kiss. Mmm. Oscar Wilde knew what he was talking about. More wine? I shouldn't. It's late. Oh. That's too bad. I think you're ready for your audition. Thanks to you. I gotta go. Okay, whatever you say. Um-- At least let me call you a cab. Okay. I'm a cab. Marco, it's Wilson. What do you want? Heard your play's a smash. What do you want? Too bad you used my life and didn't have the balls to put me in it. Not again. No, I don't wanna argue. I just called to tell you a riddle. I'm hanging up. What's black and blue and bruised all over? I'm hanging up. It's Lucy. Or what's left of her. You bastard! Anything happens to her, and you're dead! Mmm. Mortals are so fragile. Wilson, are you there? Wilson! Wilson! Showtime. Your cab will be here soon, okay? I'll get your sweater. Lucy, you're all right. Marco. No! I've hated that bastard for over 30 years. He set you up. He killed your husband. Wait a minute. Marco was an Immortal. You knew the rules when you married him. I was a child in the middle of a fairy tale. I didn't expect to wind up with my dead husband in my arms. But that's the way we live, Lucy. No, that's the way youlive, Amanda. If somebody killed my wife, I'd go after him with a chainsaw. Wilson didn't kill Marco because of the game. He killed him because he was jealous of Marco's success. At least you understand, Nick. About what? Mortals, Immortals taking people's heads off? Lucy, I know what it's like to have killed. I mean up close, where you can see the light go out in their eyes. It's not pretty, and you don't wanna go there. Nick. Nick, he's already seen me. But you-- He turns a corner, you put a bullet in his head, I'll finish it. - You won't even be killing him. - No! - The man's a killer. - Look, Lucy, he's right. We're talking about the rest of your life. What I think you need to do, honey, is just take a rest and-- Oh, I don't expect you to understand. It's all a game to you, right? No, we understand. But it's been 30 years, and I think you should let it go now. What is the matter with you two? Don't you even remember what it's like to lose someone you love? Oh, to hell with both of you! Will you be my lawyer, honey? Hey, run Snow White for me, will you, Harry? Pro bono? Don't remember you. Oh, well, they transferred me from upstate last month. Oh, yeah. Up since 5:00, all day in court. Then I get this call. I gotta defend some crazy broad. You came to the right place. Yeah. Yeah, she was waving, um-- waving a-a-- Yep, that's what it says, all right-- waving a sword. A sword and a gun around. Does that make, uh, any sense? Ring any bells? Uh, that's kind of hard to forget. Makes an impression, you know? Yeah, I'll bet. She's gone. No victim, no complainant. Well, there you go. Nobody tells me squat. Damn! Yeah, well, life's a bitch. Welcome to town. Hey, um, do you have an address? Uh, a phone number? I just gotta get some signatures and I'll put it in the out-box. Becker, Lucy. There's your address. How's that? You're a lifesaver. Mm-hmm. Mine. More! You were-- were wonderful. Was I? No. You were more than wonderful. Everywhere you are, there is light. What was that for? For being brilliant. And for being all mine. Lucy, Marco! It's the first time I've ever lost anyone that I really loved. You know, he really loved you. He couldn't quit talking about you-- how proud he was. He told me he was absolutely happy after centuries of looking for someone special. What was he like a hundred years ago? Basically, the-the same. You know, gorgeous, talented, brilliant, annoying. Opinionated. Annoying. Annoying. Did he still have that terrible habit of chewing with his mouth open? Oh, God. Didn't you hate that? And the snoring? Like a freight train. And he'd always say: One night, I taped him. I woke him up at 3:00 in the morning to play it for him. You didn't do that. And you know what he said? Of course. Excuse me. Do I know you from somewhere? Uh-- Well, possibly it was the court of Louis XIV. I vaguely remember something about, uh, perfume and feathers... and a small yelping dog. That's very attractive. Must be the company. Mmm. You know what? You girls deserve each other. Thanks. You know, I think he may be right. I don't know. She's not gonna listen to me. Can we get her out of town somehow? Well, well. Amanda. Wilson. I heard you were in town. You must've read my reviews. Not quite. Don't worry. He knows everything. He's a friend of mine. Nick Wolfe. Nick. Hmm. Wilson Geary. Yeah, I know who you are. Jay Leno, right? Ed Sullivan, maybe? You're sure as hell too young to remember vaudeville. Oh, God, Amanda. You must be doing something right. I have no complaints. What the hell are you doing here? I live here, darling. Oh. Ooh! the funniest thing happened on my way out of the theater last night. - Mmm? - Oh. Did I mention that I'm doing a one-man show down at the Music Hall? I am killing them. Oh. I'm closing in three days. You don't want to miss it. - Mmm. - You were about to tell us what you were doing here. Last night, the craziest thing happened. Some old broad shot me. Lucy Becker? They told me she lived here. She does. Well, who the hell is she, and why does she want to whack me? Wilson, Lucy Becker, as in Marco and Lucy Becker. Marco and Lucy. Oh. Well, what years do to people. She used to be such a fox. But why would she wanna whack me? Maybe she's pissed because you murdered her husband. She told you I murdered him? Uh, yes, in great detail. Oh. Talk about rewriting history. History's five guys in a room agreeing on a lie. Okay, I killed him. So, are you gonna give it up that easily? I, um, see a large dog with a sign that reads, "Private property. Keep out. " I don't bite, unless you ask me politely. Are you coming on to me? Is that a problem? What will your husband say? Three's a crowd. What? Okay, here's the thing. I don't care that you're here because I know you've had a few too many. I have not. Okay, you're a little high then. And a little "hi" to you too. I'll do the jokes here. And I don't care that, uh-- that you're using me to get another man jealous. Is that what I'm doing? I just wanna know one thing. Yeah? Will you respect me in the morning? - Marco! - You bitch! Marco, no! Marco! Marco, no! Stop it! Stop! Marco! Please! Marco! Stop! No! No! No! I don't know how she remembered it, but that's the way it was. What a guy. You should get yourself bronzed. Okay, I was saving my own ass. Hers, as cute as it was, went along for the ride. Lucky her. Lucky him. The only other witness is dead. Tell me something. How did Marco know where to find her? Give me strength. Maybe someone saw us leaving the bar together. I heard she never acted again, which is a pity. The stage lost a great lady. But that's not my fault either. I don't care if she thanks me, but I sure as hell don't expect to get whacked. Big of you. Yeah? Well, what do you get when you cross a mortal with an Immortal? I can't wait. What? A train wreck. Some things just aren't funny. You're leaving town soon, right? Three more days. Then I'm booked in Denver. Look, Wilson, I would take it as a personal favor-- Seeing you again has really freaked her out. You keep Lucy away, she grows old and dies. If she comes after me-- Drop by backstage when you come see the show. He's full of crap. Mmm. Oh. You believe this guy over Lucy? Well, memories are funny. Sometimes you remember the things the way they were, and sometimes you remember them the way you want to remember them. And sometimes, people lie through their teeth. Doesn't matter. All we have to do is keep Lucy busy for a couple of days. Hello? Bas, quit-- Quit yell-- What do you mean, you sold her a gun? Uh, why-- No, I don't-- Why did you sell her a gun? All right, I don't wanna hear this. I will talk to you later. Bye. She's gone. I'm gonna kill her. Lucy? It's okay. Nick. Oh, my God, Nick. Lucy, is that you? What the hell is going on? We're fine. Who the hell's shooting? Lucy. But you didn't. But she could've. Amanda, she was aiming at me. If I'm not pissed, you shouldn't be. Well, what the hell was she thinking? What the hell were you thinking? You've done crazier things. You're not me. You got that right. Look, she knows the game. It wasn't personal. Here's a headline for you, okay? She loved him. That made it personal. I can't expect you to understand what I'm talking about. Here we go again, right? This was the one true love of her life. You can tell every time she talks about it. You can see it on her face. We're not like you. We don't live forever. We get maybe one shot at it. Where are you going? I'm making it personal. Oh. That was close. I almost cut my own throat. Of course, there's a boatload of critics who would be happy to volunteer. I was thinking about what you said. I thought maybe you could help me clear something up. Hmm. Why don't you listen to me this time? I don't like repeating myself. What if I was immortal? You're much too uptight. How big was your apartment back then? Where is this going, Sherlock? Well, as far as I can tell, the friendly ones feel the same as your enemies. Sensing them, I mean. Hmm. Well, you can't tell the players without the program. Right. Mmm. So you're makin' love to Lucy-- Yes. and you sense an Immortal coming. He may be coming to take your head, but you don't do a damn thing about it... until he's in the room about to whack you. Thatis passion. Well, actually, I was asleep. You know that thing men do that pisses women off. Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am, and then-- Speaking of which, how is Amanda? Never's a long time in my world. Three days is a long time in mine. Are you threatening me? Watch your head. He was here? Yes, looking for you. And you're telling me that he left with his head still attached to his body? Did you offer him tea and cookies too? Lucy, he told me it was self-defense. What? I'm just telling you what he said-- that Marco was in a crazy, jealous rage and he had to protect himself and you. He used me to get Marco there. Then he ambushed him. He also told me... you slept with him that night. A lying bastard! Did you? You believe him? Lucy, now, Marco didn't die because you let another man touch you. I've known you a long time. I love you. You can tell me anything. Oh, Amanda. It's okay, honey. I loved Marco. I know. I know. He wasn't supposed to die first. He wasn't supposed to die because of me. I felt so inadequate, and you were so beautiful. I saw how he looked at you-- how his eyes lit up when you smiled. I was upset and nervous. This was our night. Wilson said everything I needed to hear. He told me that I was smart-- that I was beautiful. I was the reason behind Marco's success. I don't know if I really believed him. Didn't matter. He wanted me, and I needed to be wanted. Oh! Somebody's moving the floor. I gotta go. Oh, you-you can't make me drink alone. Lucy, I like you... a lot. I like you too, Wilson. Why don't you stay with me then? Just for tonight. I can't. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to lead you on. Could I tell you something before you go? He does not deserve you. You're... smart. You're beautiful. Really? Yeah. Lucy! Marco! You're alive. No! What can you say? You made a mistake. Marco died because I was weak. There were things I needed to hear. I promised myself I'd never need to hear those things again. Yeah, but Wilson Geary would have come after Marco with or without you. But at least Marco had a chance. I took that away from him. I hear what you're saying, but I-- I just think if you can, you need to let it go. You don't have 1,000 years like me to forget. Yeah, you're right. You know, I think I should get away for a few days. My sister's been calling, asking me to come and visit. I'll take you. No. No, I think I need the time alone. Okay. Well, um, I'll help you pack. No. Amanda, please. Let it go. I need to get away from Immortals for a while. Nothing personal. Take as much time as you need. Amanda, I did warn you. Yes, well, I know how hard it is to find good help these days. Well, maybe you should come down to the theater... and pick up, you know, the pieces. Did I ever tell you how much I love a captive audience? I think we may have broken her heart. Promise me you won't scream, and I'll take this off. Yet, each man kills the thing he loves. The coward does it with a kiss. The brave man with a sword. You remembered. I'm touched. Why don't you just kill me now and get it over with? But who'd be here at the end to applaud? How did you lose her? I thought it was over. I thought she was okay. Right. Look, I'm not her mother. She wanted to leave town. I thought it was fine. "Fine. " What, she suddenly forgave the man who murdered her husband? She didn't forgive him. She forgave herself. Come on. -You know it's a trap. - Of course it is. That's why I called you. Oh, I'm flattered. What about that famous noninterference clause? You're not going to interfere. You're going to get Lucy out of there. And leave you alone to fight Wilson? It'll be a lot easier if I know she's safe. And even easier if you had some help. Those aren't the rules. Don't argue, please. Just help me. Wilson was right. It's a train wreck. Yeah, but it's a hell of a ride. And thus I clothe my naked villainy-- And seem a saint when most I play the devil. Richard III. You know, I used to be a great actor. Used to be is right. Everyone's a critic. And some of us are psychotic. Oh, Lucy, Lucy, Lucy. What the years do to people. Well, your journey from tender young thing... to a buffet for worms will all have happened... in the blink of an Immortal's eye. I'll live long enough to spit on your grave. No, I don't think so. Then this'll have to do. Nick, for Lucy's sake, do this one my way. Oh, Lucy. Bastard. I'm gonna take you home. Amanda, I can't believe it. I almost killed you. You'll just try anything, won't you? Get her out of here, Nick. Come on, Lucy. Let's go. Isn't that cute? It's okay. Curtain, darling. Congratulations. You brought down the house. It's over. It's done. Thank you, Amanda. Don't thank me for killing someone. Not for killing. For winning. I think we better go. Nick. Loving Marco was the best thing I ever did. Let's go home, cookie.
