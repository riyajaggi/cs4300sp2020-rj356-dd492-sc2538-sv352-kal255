 Captain Donald Magnus! Oh! Oh, my God. Damn, man. What the hell were you doing? You're dead, aren't you? Oh-- Oh, man, I-I-- I must really be fried. You see these? You recognize 'em? - First Armored Division. - "Abdul's Nightmare. " - Rock and roll, baby! - What the hell do you want? What do we have here? Well, look at this.

 Medal of Honor. You're a hero! You better disappear while you still can! A-10. Viper's got more kick, but what the hell, it gets the job done. Turn 'em and burn 'em-- ain't that right, Captain? You got ten seconds before you're history! Check the chambers, Mary. You're runnin' on empty. Shootin' an unarmed man. Tut, tut. What would your mama say? One of your own, too. You son of a bitch! On your feet, soldier! I said, get up! - You are gone, man. - Just doin' my duty, son. Pucker factor at 10, eh, Captain? I go, you go.

 Can I get a "Geronimo" here? Hoo-ah! Hey! Damn. She is immortal. A thousand years old and she cannot die. A creature of legend... like the raven, a thief who stole the sun and the moon. They sent a warrior to bring her back. He found her. Together, they brought back light to the world. I was a cop. To me she was just a thief, another day on the job. But she wasn't-- She changed my life, changed everything. And both of us knew from that moment on, nothing would ever be the same. Here's to my little brother. A 21-beer salute. Don would have loved that one. Did a real nice job with the eulogy, Carl. Yeah. Good for me. If Rachel or the kids need anything-- Maybe I should give you a lift home. Maybe. Maybe if Donnie had stayed put, didn't go to the Gulf-- Maybe he could have resisted the urge to throw himself off a goddamn building. Maybe. Stupid bastard. Tough being a soldier. - Tough being a cop. - Too tough for you. Ever think about coming back on the force? You're drunk. - Gettin' there. - Let me take you home. Don't patronize me! You think about it. Yeah, I'll think about it. All right. Let's go. Not home. I got a stop to make first. I could use a friend. You sure you wanna do this today, Carl? At least he died a hero. Looks like he had a rough couple of years. Donnie wouldn't talk about it. Not even with me. You know how he could be. Sure do. Proud, stubborn. Just like someone else I know. See that? That scar right there? He's got one to match. Caught me smokin' dope in the tree house. I was 15. I guess he'd be nine. And I made him swear, on a blood oath, our secret together-- forever. Of course, forever seems likeforever when you're a kid. Rachel said that... the war turned him into a ghost. He just gave up. Eventually, she did too. What happened here? What? The lock's broken. Yeah. So? Well, the door's all splintered. Yeah. And the kitchen sink's jammed, the toilet's backed up-- what else? Okay. Nothing. Brilliant. "John Fielding. " Did my duty, Dex. For us. All of us. Nick is doing really well. Thought you'd like to know. He's not a cop anymore, but... I think you'd be very proud of him. Claudia-- Claudia! Claudia! You've left me a lot to live up to. We need it now. Right now. You there! Mademoiselle. What are you doing here? All civilians were evacuated. Oh, monsieur. I am so sorry. I did not know. Uh, calvados? Whiskey? Perhaps you buy? You seem very thirsty, yes? Cinq centimes. Uh, no. I mean, you can't-- You're not allowed here. But it is home-made, fromla pomme-- uh, how you say, um, "apples"? From the apples of my own farm. Look, you have to leave this area. It's too dangerous. Oh, but monsieur. I squeeze thepommemyself. Very ripe one too. And juicy. I'm sorry. I have my orders. What are orders, compared to the fruits of nature? I just want you to sample my fruits. Just a drink between friends, eh? Even during war, a man needs a friends. How long has it been since you've had a friend? All right. I guess it couldn't hurt. - Oh, monsieur, you've made me very happy. - One drink. Yes. One-- Refreshing,non? Unconscious, yes? Adieu, sweet prince. You keep the basket. I'll take the horse. Lance Corporal Fielding. Ah, there you are. Stay a moment. Lieutenant, I want the artillery ready to move in 30 minutes. Yes, sir. Fielding? Official intelligence for the front. You'll leave as soon as the barrage lifts. 0900. Yes, sir! After you've delivered the orders, I want you to keep this safe for my arrival. Uh, excuse me, Colonel. Jewels, gold coins, all this stuff. Aren't they from the ch??tea u down the road, sir? That was an order, corporal. Yes, sir! Come on, boy. Come on, boy. Mademoiselle! Au secours-- Secours. Oh, secours, secours. What's that? Monsieur? Uh,parlez-vous anglais? Are you all right? I'm quite well, thank you. But I'll be much better when you hand over that pouch. You're crazy. Correction. I'm armed. And I'd hate to have to kill you. Look-- This pouch is gotta reach the front. Hand it over. I said, hand me the jewels. Many thanks. Wait. Y-You don't understand. Oh, I certainly do. But trust me. You'll get over it. If not this century, then the next one. Wait. There's orders in there. Wait! Hey, wait! John Ray Fielding. You're a soldier again. Still. And you? I thought you'd be long dead by now. Well, aren't you glad I'm not? Puts a whole new light on things. You knew. Way back then. About you being Immortal? - Yes. I knew. - Hmm. Live around here now, do ya? Mm. Here, there. Wherever fate takes me. You know, it's a funny thing about fate. - What's that? - It doesn't discriminate. Next time we meet, it's not gonna be on holy ground. Amanda, you've never mentioned any John Ray before. Well, darling, I really didn't see the point. There's nothing memorable about him. But he obviously remembers you. Ah, what can I say? When you got it, you got it. But Amanda-- Would you quit worrying? He didn't follow me home... and he doesn't know my name. But he still wants your head! Lucy, if you're looking for answers, I'm not the one. I didn't wait around for him to ask questions. So. What do I pack? The Louis Vuitton or the Tumi? Is it Paris, or are we roughing it? Is that your answer to absolutely everything? "When the going gets tough, the tough get passports"? Yes! There's nothing linking the two of us together. I promise you. I will never have to see him again. If I'm lucky. Hello, Nick! Hello, Lucy. I'll um-- I'll put on a fresh pot of coffee. Mm. Oh, my God! You were drafted. I've got a riddle for you. What's that? "When's a dead soldier not a dead soldier? " I give up. When he's an Immortal. Mm. "John Ray Fielding. " John Ray Fielding. I checked with Washington. He died in the Gulf War seven years ago. You know him? Yes and no. Ah, yes, he's an Immortal. Yes, I know him, and no, I can't tell you where he is. That was easy. I'm defenseless in face of your steely eyed determination. Where is he? I guess you weren't listening. I can't tell you where he is. My God! Jodhpurs are in again this year. Can't or won't? Yes. Here we go again. All right, first of all, I don't know where he is. Second of all, I don't want to know where he is. Why not? Let's just say we didn't part on the best of terms. You're not gonna tell me where to find him, are you? Mm-mmm. Even if I tell you he might have information about the death of Carl Magnus's brother? Oh, that's different. Mm-mmm. You know, you can really be a heartless, selfish bitch sometimes. Well, darling, that's taken centuries of practice. So soon? Not soon enough. Hey, hands off, man! Come on. I'm callin' your parents. - May I help you, sir? - My apartment was robbed. - What was stolen? - Cash. Some jewelry. - I saw her leave. - What'd she look like? Well, sir, sh-she was tall. - Beautiful. - Lucky you. Short, platinum blonde hair. Here. Try to picture her blonde. - Oh, yeah. That's her. -Amanda Montrose. Okay. Let's bring her in! Looks like we finally got her. Thanks. No, Detective. Thank you. What the hell are you doin'? Having lunch. Look, I was going to tell you, Carl. You requisitioned my dead brother's service record and didn't think I'd be interested? I just wanted to look at the file and see. And what? Find out what? Do what? Tie up some loose ends. Donnie committed suicide. He left behind an ex-wife, two kids, and a liver the size of my desk. Period. End of goddamn story. You never found a note. What else? The door frame. It was splintered from the inside. You don't kick in a door and commit suicide. Could have happened days ago. Come on, Carl. You've been a cop for 25 years. You can feel when something's off. I've been a brother for over 40. I know how it feels to watch a man destroy himself. To watch him lose his job, his life, his wife, his family, his honor! Do you know what, Wolfe? Sometimes life just turns to crap. There isn't a goddamn thing you can do about it. - Okay, Carl. I got it. - Good. Good. - We done? - You bet. One more thing. We pulled your girlfriend in an hour ago for a lineup. Amanda Montrose. The human boomerang. - Excuse me, darling? - Just can't stay away, can ya? How ya doin', Robbins? Love what you've done with your hair. Ever thought of joining our "Frequent Offenders Club"? 5,000 free points for your first conviction. Oh, I'll keep that in mind. Whoa, Robbins! Uh-uh. What do you mean, "Uh-uh"? - None of those. - But you identified her from her picture. I was wrong. Well, then, take another look. Number Three, step forward! You want me to accuse the wrong person? Oh, come on. You gave me a description. And she's a match. No can do. Good-bye. Thank you. Come again soon. I'm sorry, Detective. What the hell is this all about? She wasn't there. Next time, yank somebody else's chain. That was fast. I'm just on 24 down. I'm sorry. Perhaps you'd like me to go back inside until you're finished. Okay. One of those days, huh? I'm sorry, Lucy. I'm not mad at you. - Get in the car. - You goin' somewhere? Yeah. I got a cake in the oven. Now. You mind telling me what you were doing in there? She hasn't got the time to talk to you right now. - Who the hell are you, Slick? - Amanda and I were just leaving. Nobody's goin' anywhere until I find out what's goin' on here. Great. High Noonin front of the police station. Could you two be any more obvious? - Drop it. Drop the guns. Come on, do it. - Come on! Let's go! -Move it! - Up against the car. Got a guy says you pulled a gun on him because he figured your girlfriend for a thief. I resent being called that. Thief? Girlfriend. That's right. Keep it up. Soon you'll be laughing from the inside of a cell. Well, it's good to know you haven't lost your objectivity. Talk. I was born very young. My parents kept moving away, but I always found them-- Shut up! What the hell was going on out there? I have a license to carry a gun, Carl. Thanks a lot, Wolfe. Ms. Becker. Oh, please. You can call me Lucy. That's better. Thank you. Well, now, Lucy. What have you got for me? You wouldn't happen to know a three-letter word for a palindromic diarist? Screw all of you. I'm bringin' in the witness. Chapman! Where the hell's Chapman? Don't even smile! "Nin. " As in, "Anai??s Nin. " Nin. Yes! Chapman! Jesus! Chapman! This is not a good day! Damn! Jesus, Carl. Where ya been? - It's late. What are you doin' here? - Been thinkin'. - Yeah, I can smell it. - You're a putz, you know that? - You want to come inside? - I'm warnin' ya. - Don't hold out on me. - I'll make you some coffee. He was my brother. Something's goin' on, I got a right to know. I tell you what. If I find out anything, you'll be the first to know. I wish you knew him before the Gulf. - Me too. - He had all these plans. We were gonna build this boat together. This big wooden cruiser. Still got all the lumber in my garage. Can't use it. Can't sell it. Just seems like such a waste. Hey, the coffee offer still stands. I don't need to tell ya, Nick. Tell me what? This one's personal. I find you held out on me, I'll nail your goddamn ass to a cross myself. Fair enough. Have a pleasant evening. This is getting old. I don't want to kill you. That's good, 'cause I don't wanna die. Now, we could just shoot each other here and now, but you'd still have the advantage, wouldn't ya? - Meaning? - You do a lousy impression of a dead guy. So you know. Oh, yeah. I know. Well, I know something about you too. You're an honorable man. Right now, I'm a severely pissed-off man. Honor. It's why you left the police force. It's why I didn't just shoot you here in the dark. You'd have made a fine soldier. You killed Donald Magnus. An enemy was neutralized. He was no enemy. The war's over. You killed him. Killed? Nah, we don't kill anymore. Oh, we used to. Before you was born-- hell, before your daddy was born-- back when war was a filthy slaughterhouse... and men were screamin', bleedin' things! The good old days, eh? But no one's killed anymore. Eliminated, yeah. Degraded, you bet. Suppressed. Impacted. Taken out. But blips on a radar screen cannot be killed. Well, you tell Magnus's wife and kids. You see if they give a damn about your semantics. You ever smell a man burned to death? What the hell are you talkin' about? Oh, man, I gotta tell you. It has got a sweet, ripe, hot stench... till it catches, deep in your throat. I want you to imagine four men, all burnin' alive, all trapped inside a tank... with no way out. You were there. First Armored Division, 15th Tank Battalion, on the Saudi-Kuwaiti border, rockin' and rollin' on Death Row Highway. I was walkin' back to my tank. I looked up-- There was a laser-guided missile, fired from one of our own A-10s-- Hoo-ah! That's an instant microwave, man. Now. You tell me. Who was the zoomie? The what? The zoomie. The patch guy? The pilot. Donald Magnus. I was blown clear to hell, but not before I heard my men burnin' alive. But was it murder? Hell, no! Friendly fire. Brass even gave him a medal to cover it up. So you hunted him down. You killed him. Where's the honor in that? Hey, I gave him his shot. I took him to the wall, man! He went Elvis! Who the hell do you think you are? Because you're an Immortal, you think you can just play God? What would you do if someone killed your partner? Oh, damn. That's right. Somebody did. So what did you do? I said, what did you do? Say it, soldier. Somebody murdered your partner, and what did you do? I put a goddamn bullet right in their head! Like I said, you're an honorable man. So you will understand when I take Amanda's head. Amanda? What the hell has she got to do with this? Just like Donald Magnus. She's a murderer. A what? A murderer. That little jarhead. If I were you, I'd pack my bags. Well, he's obviously insane, Nick. Amanda. Do you remember the dispatch pouch you stole from him? Yeah. It had some jewels and a few francs in it. And an envelope. I don't know. I can't remember. If it wasn't full of money, I probably tossed it. What's the big deal, anyway? It was the middle of the war. Intelligence knew the Germans were about to attack the front. The 18th Battalion were sitting ducks. 120 of them. That envelope contained general orders telling them to get the hell out of there. But the orders never made it to the front. - And John Ray? - He died. With the rest of them. How many? How many? 120 men. No, I cou-- I didn't do that. I just-- It was a pouch, with jewels in it. And I wanted it to get out. I didn't do that. No. Amanda. No. Amanda-- Please, talk to me. - No! - What the hell is happening to me? I used to travel wherever I wanted to go, and I did whatever I wanted to do. I mean, a little burglary here, a little petty larceny there-- you know, my life was just rolling along and it was fine. You don't have time for this. And then your partner, Claudia, she has to go and die trying to save my stupid life. All of a sudden I have to start thinking about what I'm doing... and what I'm about, and all these things that I've done. In 1,200 years, a person is bound to have some regrets. Regrets? You call this a regret? - Don't be so hard on yourself. - Really? You don't think that it's about time? I mean, I've lived my whole life... with not a care in the world, and all of a sudden, I find out I'm leaving a trail of corpses. I killed 120 men. I'm not running away. He's a professional soldier. We all are. Look, I know you want to take responsibility for this, but you can't. The only thing you can take responsibility for... is introducing me to my conscience. Just go. Nick! You are 180 out, son. Come on. Read it. Read it! "Donald George Magnus. " We've already met. His obituary says he died four days ago. But that's a lie. I saw the autopsy report. His kidney and lungs were shot. His heart was running on fumes. Aw, you want me to cry? So he was killin' himself. Because he couldn't live with what he'd done! Because he was a soldier, just like you. Not like me. Not like me at all. No. He was a husband. A father. A brother. A soldier who made a mistake. A mistake he lived with every day since. I thought you were gonna stay clear. I lied. Take the cuffs off of him. Nothing can happen. It's holy ground. Don't make me regret this. Just give us a minute. There was a time I was one of them. A man. A mortal man. You took that away from me. I didn't kill you. Didn't you? I remember it rained the night before, so the ground was all wet. Muddy. I got hit. I went down. - I couldn't move. - Please don't do this. There was mud in my eyes, my nose. The world was explodin' all around me. It was my first death. Look, I just wanted the jewels. I didn't think-- I never think about the consequences. Got to watch my wife grieve for me. Then I watched her marry again. Have the children I could never give her. Finally, I watched her grow old, and die. Look, I'm really sorry. I don't know what else I can say. Bein' a soldier was all I knew how to do, so that's what I became. France. Spain. World War II. Korea. Vietnam. The Gulf. Livin' to die. - Over and over again. - War after war. How can you do that? It's all I know. You killed 120 of my brothers. It is time you honored their deaths. That's over. Just like that? Just like that. - Lift? - Uh, I think I need a little time. Friendly fire? You lyin' son of a bitch! Take it easy! Relax. You wanted the truth, Carl. You don't have to like it. - Settle down, now. - I'd think real hard about ever doin' that again. He came home the conquerin' hero. Threw him this great, big party. Picture in all the papers. How could he have ever told us with all that goin' on? You wanna go public? I'll back you up. I'll take on anybody you want. Pentagon-- you name it. I'm there, okay? - The truth'll come out. - The truth is he killed his own men and was murdered for it. The truth is, he's not a hero. How can I tell Rachel and the kids? How can I do that to Donnie? What, do I kill him all over again? It's your call. Here's to my brother. The hero. Your shield's still in my drawer. - I know. - Door's open now. I don't know how long it'll stay that way. -Where is she? - She's sleeping. Who put that candle there? It doesn't go with that table. It's 3:00 in the afternoon. She's sleeping? She's very tired. This whole John Ray thing has really worn her out. There! That's better. I swear to God, little elves come out in the middle of the night and rearrange things. Would you tell her I dropped by? Would you do that for me, Lucy? Yeah. Sure. Nick. She's not sleeping. She's not here. And she didn't take this. What are you waitin' for? No. - Fight me! - I'm not a killer. Irresponsible, inconsiderate, dishonest, maybe. - But I'm not a killer. - Draw your sword! - I have no quarrel with you. - The hell you don't. Just get it over with. - What are you doing? - If you're going to do it, just do it! - This is a trick, right? - No, sir. Those men are dead because of me. I'm willing to take the responsibility for what I've done. But I'm not gonna kill you. I'm not even gonna pretend. I salute your courage. Drop it! Drop the blade. I know how to kill you. This ain't your battle. It's not yours, either. It's the honorable thing. Don't kid yourself. This isn't about honor. You don't know squat. I know pride when I see it. And guilt. I know a little about guilt too. Hey, I gotnothin' to feel guilty about! Sure you do. You lived. You survived. While all your men, all your buddies, were blown up all around you. So let's not dress this thing up and say it has anything to do with honor. You weren't there. You don't know what war does. I know what guilt does. She's dead. You killed her. The war is over. There is always another war. You tell her she died with honor. Oh! He's gone. What happened? Where is he? He left. For good? For good. I don't get it. - He forgave you. - He did? Yeah. Now comes the hard part. - What's that? - Forgiving yourself. Closed-Captioned By Captions, Inc. Los Angeles Subtitles ripped by Ziina
