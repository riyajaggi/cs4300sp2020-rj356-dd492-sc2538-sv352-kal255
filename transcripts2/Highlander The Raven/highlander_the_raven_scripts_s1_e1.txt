 She is immortal. A thousand years old and she cannot die. A creature of legend... like the raven, a thief who stole the sun and the moon. They sent a warrior to bring her back. He found her. Together, they brought back light to the world. I was a cop. To me she was just a thief, another day on the job.

 But she wasn't-- She changed my life, changed everything. And both of us knew from that moment on, nothing would ever be the same. I hate this. I hate it when I screw up. Don't blame yourself. Fine. I hate it when you screw up. That's much better. Yeah, you think this is funny? You tell the captain we lost her. - Mommy. - The kids wanted to kiss Mommy good night. Oh, you can't fool me. You just wanted to stay up late. Okay. Now home and to bed for the both of you. It's gonna be late. Usually is. Put your seat belts on. You said we could go inside.

 I said, "Put on your seat belts. " I love you. You okay? You know, I'm not doing this 'cause I have to. Oh, mama. Meals on wheels. Up yours. Ferris, you get the fives on that robbery? Just a second, Captain. I have to take care of Mr. Halloway here. Come on, Mr. Halloway. Come on. Come on. Now, you remember, just 'cause your wife's dog barks too much, you can't poison him. It's not allowed. You go on home. I heard. How many times did she lose your ass, Stanley? What did I say? Leave it alone, Ferris. Just got a call from Confidential Security. The Marshall estate was hit tonight. Son of a bitch. She knew we were on her, and she was playing with us. Let's go meet the legend. Now? Yeah, now. You're back, finally. How'd we do? You can relax. We did great tonight. We don't need great. We need spectacular. You're spending three times as much as you're stealing. You're not going straight on me, are you? Oh, lately I don't know. I'm just not as psyched as I used to be. I think maybe I'm bored. Must be a bitch-- being 1,200 years old and just hitting midlife crisis. Midlife? Bite your tongue. At least I kept my complexion. That was the doorman. The police are on their way up. Show them in. Amanda Montrose? Don't be shy. - I'm Detective Wolfe. - Wolfe? This is my partner, Detective Hoffman. Tell me, Detective, do you ever howl at the moon? Where were you tonight? Tonight? Between 10:15 and 11:30. Let's see. Well, um, Lucy and I-- Oh, you met Lucy, didn't you? She and I rented a video, which you should know about since you were following us. And then we came home and popped popcorn and champagne corks. Which you don't know about because you weren't invited. Which video? - Excuse me? - Which video? Oh, "Legends" something or other-- You know, the Brad Pitt thing. You know, he has the most sensuous mouth. Ah, yes. Brad Pitt, I mean. Ms. Montrose, or whatever your name of the day is, why don't we get out of the tub... and conduct this interview like the professionals we all are? Oh. Well, your call. Wait. Oh? Now that is an attractive man. Like my Uncle Arnie used to say, "Sleep with the devil, wake up with burns on your ass. " Lucy, you never had an Uncle Arnie. Hello, my pretties. First thing tomorrow morning, I go see Harry. "Cash 'n' Carry Harry. " Hard to undress a woman with your eyes when she's already naked. Me? Claudia, you know I can't look at another woman with you around. Nice try, putz. The thief lives like a queen, and me and David are still trying to pay off Eric's braces. She's goin' down, one way or another. Why don't you take it? There's also some nice towels and a soap dish in the bathroom if you like. Detective-- Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Not without a search warrant. Hmm. So, after you watched this video, where did you go? You've been watching me for a week. Don't you guys have this written down somewhere? - Answer the questions. - I returned the video, and I came back here. Didn't I, Lucy? Now, if I'm going downtown, I guess I need to talk to my lawyer? Not necessary. - Yet. - Good. Lucy, would you please show them to the door? Lucy, dis-leur qu'ils m'embrassent le cul. [And tell them to kiss my ass] Perhaps some other time. Ne vous derangez pas. On conn??it le chemin. Remind me not to underestimate you, Detective. Harry? Harry? You up there? Oh, Harry. Couldn't they just rob you? You mean dead drunk, don't you? I mean dead dead, like shot through the heart. Poor Harry. He was a good man for a fence. So now what? Now we go to Basil. Oh, not Basil. We hate Basil. He's a self-righteous ganef. Start here. Claudia, take the library. Kitchen, bedroom. All right. I'll do the kitchen. Took your advice. I got a warrant. All you had to do was ask nicely. Why'd you kill Harry? Harry who? "Harry who? " Harry nobody as of this morning. But I got a witness who saw you leaving his place. Hello. - What the hell is that? - Looks like a nine-millimeter to me. Let me guess. Harry was killed with a nine-millimeter? - Assume the position. - Well, I usually get dinner first. You have the right to remain silent. I suppose it wouldn't make any difference if I told you I didn't own a gun. If you choose to give up that right, anything you say... can be used against you in a court of law. Get the elevator. I got the roof! Freeze! It's Amanda, Princess of Thieves. Really, Basil, you could work up some enthusiasm. I come bearing gifts. Francis Marshall collection. Brung it here? How did you know it was me? Who else would it be, deary? And who else would I bring it to? Harry. Except he's as dead as a doornail. With Harry gone, you had to come... to your old pal Basil. Ah, such a shame what happened to dear old Harry, isn't it? Tragic. No, I don't know who or why. I just know his time is up. And unlike us Immortals, he doesn't get to turn the hourglass over... and let the sand run through again. Forty cents on the dollar. I need the goods to show the buyer. Unless you want 20 cents on the dollar. You screw me on this, Bas, and you're going to wish you were as lucky as poor old Harry. Don't turn around. Hand it over. What else you got in there? Nice sword. 4-3-2 in progress. 737 North Bodswell. All cars in vicinity. Bloody hell. Okay. Where'd she go, Lucy? - Ich weiss nicht. - Where are the jewels? "Jew-els? " Detective Hoffman. Oh, hey, sweetheart. W-Well, look, if Daddy says you have to eat the broccoli, then, yes, you do have to eat the broccoli. Look, I'll be home to kiss you good night. Yes, I promise. I love you too. Come on, Lucy, jewels, diamonds, rubies. Mein Englisch ist-- Ist-- Ist perfect, like the six other languages that you speak. I want to see my lawyer. You haven't even read me my rights yet. You're not under arrest... yet. Okay. Come on. Here's the thing. I'm in a bit of a tough spot here. I'm a working mom. I got two kids, one who's at home right now with a cold, the other one who's failed his last two spelling tests because I'm never there. If you could just tell me where she went, then we can all go home now. This is kind of a woman-to-woman thing. You want to be friends, right? Well, pretty much, yeah. Detective, I already have a friend. Where the hell have you been? What's with the maid? Call her that to her face and she'll rip your lungs out. She know anything? Right now, she's never even heard of her. So you don't have my money or my jewels? Amanda, the wanker shot me. You know how I am about pain. Poor baby. It hurt a lot. What did he look like, Bas? Tall, dark clothes, ski mask. This is pissing me off. You? I had this shirt custom made in Hong Kong. I want you to pay attention to me, Bas. Harry was murdered, and the weapon was planted on me. You're a suspect? A cop set me up. Case files aren't gonna tell you where she's hiding. I don't know. Maybe I missed something. Go home. If I find something, I'll call you. Drop the gun, Wolfe. This is a new twist for you. Generally speaking, you only break into places... where there are actually things worth stealing. Maybe if you told me what it was you were looking for. Evidence. I found your problem. You see, I'm the cop; you're the thief. Are you always so witty? Look, someone planted that gun on me. - You suspect me. - Who else should I suspect? I don't know. You like it? Take it. - Why? - You're a thief. Yes, I am a thief. But I don't kill. Anyway, it's not my kind of bird. Oh, I don't know. It kind of suits you. The raven's all over mythology-- Norse, Greek-- In fact, there's an Eskimo legend about one particular raven. It seems this raven was a thief. How appropriate. She stole the sun and the moon and all the stars. Mmm, I bet that's heavy to carry, even harder to fence. The legend says there was an evil chief... who planned to steal them for himself. He was gonna lock 'em up, keep the Earth in darkness. But the raven swore she stole them only to protect them from the bad guy. You see, she thought she was the hero. Now, that works for me. But the chief insisted she was only out for herself. "I didn't do it," said the bird. Uncuff me. We'll talk about it. I'll make coffee. Tell you what-- I'll be the thief; you be the hero. Amanda! What? You get caught out on the street, you do something stupid, they'll kill you. I'm not that easy to kill. Try me. Next time, let him answer the phone. Ballistics. Let me guess. The bullet that killed Harry... matches the gun found in my living room. This is funny to you? Tell me, Detective, what kind of idiot puts a gun in her own sofa? Someone who's committed murder and wants to get caught. Do I look like I want to get caught? No. - What the hell is he doing? - You ran. Innocent people don't run. They do when they're being chased. I don't do guns. That's a bunch of crap. You were placed at the scene. He was already dead. Tell me, Detective, um, when do you get to play the bad cop? What's the matter, Amanda? Did he stiff you on the price? No. Maybe he threatened to turn you in. No, Harry was my friend. How'd the murder weapon get in your home, Amanda? I didn't do it, and Lucy sure as hell didn't. As I see it, that leaves five possibilities, all with badges. - You're out of your mind. - I'm being set up. - Right. - Right. It was you, wasn't it? Why do there have to be so many cops in the same room? Poor Basil. You must need a weekend in the country... after the terrible ordeal you've been through. I should be just fine, ducky. Sweet of you to care. There's two copies in there. What the hell is up with Nick? I don't know. He checked our files out of Personnel, the four of us that busted Amanda. Even you. Well, I'm sure he's got his reasons. To what, burn us? You need to have a little talk with him, Claudia. What? Damn it. What's up with you? No, look. I'm fine. I'm fine. It's okay. It's okay. What? Did you see him? That was him. Who? The bastard that killed me. Which one? The one that was talking to the female cop. I recognized his voice. Ferris shot you? That means he killed Harry. That means he's got your jewels. Amanda, the travel agent said your tickets will be waiting for you at the airport. I've packed for warm weather. The rest I'll put in storage, and I'll ship it to you. Aren't you a little eager to, uh, get rid of me? You can't stay here, Amanda. They know you're a thief, and they think you're a murderer. Lucy, there is a cop in that building who has my jewels. And it's the same man who killed Harry and shot Basil. And the same one who's framing you. All the more reason for you to go. But, Lucy, I just got here. I like it here. And you'd miss me. But the beaches in Costa Rica are very nice. I can visit. You've done it before. Yes, but I've always been guilty before. This time I've been set up. Don't tell me it's our lovely Detective Wolfe. No, darling, it's not our lovely Detective Wolfe. But he is protecting the other one. And who's gonna protect you? Don't worry about me. Hey, Nick, how's it goin'? Busy, Stanley. What's up? Looks like you're working on some old cases. Yeah, something like that. Why don't you give it a rest? Been a long time since I bought you a drink. No, thanks. I ever tell you about my old dog, Stanley? Sweetest thing you ever met. This gonna be a long story? He had this wool rug he used to sleep on. He loved that rug more than anything in the world. Except there was this corner where the yarn was coming loose, and he wanted that yarn. So he took it in his teeth, and he'd chew on it, and he'd chew on it. And the rug would get smaller and smaller... until finally... it was gone. - He doesn't sound very bright. - He just didn't get that if you chew on something like that, it unravels. And what you're left with is nothing but a cold floor to sleep on. Well, I don't have any trouble sleeping, Nick. That's good, Stanley. Glad to hear it. I always sleep well when I know my friends are okay. That's the great thing about what we do. Knowing that our friends are okay. You just have to know who your friends are. Yeah. Lucy, would you please quit calling me? I'll be fine. This is no big deal. I'm just getting what's mine. Here he comes. Uh, gotta go. Sign this and I'll put it through. You quit. Two years. Takes that bitch to get me to light up again. You will tell me if I turn out to be the bad guy, right? Give me a break, Claudia. This isn't about you. There were five of us in the room. Not counting the criminals. She broke into my place. Why did she break into my apartment? Oh, I don't know. Maybe that's how she gets her rocks off. I got her file right here. She's never even used a gun. Ever! Claudia. Tell Eric we're playin' hoops on Saturday. Sure. Whatever. Nick! Come on! Just hold still. Ow! Did you see who was in the car? Yes. Did you? I already knew. Well, let's go get him. You go away. He framed me, Nick. What-- I saved your life. Fine. I'll just-- You know, I work better by myself anyway. Okay, I'm here. What's so important? Oh, wait. I know. You found out I'm late on my payments to Eric's orthodontist. Claudia, you're my partner and I love you, but shut up. In the past two years we've busted four major fences. Three walked, one died, and they all had one cop in common. Does he know you know? I'm thinkin' yeah. About 20 minutes ago he tried to shoot me. Can I tell you how much I hate this? You always do when I'm right. Damn it. We need backup. Suspect armed and heading for Freemount warehouse. Hand it over. Good girl. Why don't you just shoot me and get it over with? Stanley! My collar, Claudia. Call for backup. Put it down, Stanley. Not smart. Why'd you do it? Why don't you ask him about the jewels? Come on. We're family. - Oh, does that mean I can leave? - Get outta here. No. You stay put. This is Amanda Montrose. Now, the captain will promote the both of us. And we can make this a clean shoot. As clean as Harry. Nick! Claudia! Don't. Don't. I'll tell you what. I'll split it with ya. Your kids will be set for life. - Claudia! - Nick, over here. You bastard. Ferris! Damn. It's okay. I'm here for you now. It's okay. There we go. Okay. What about-- She's dead. Damn. I hate it when I screw up. Don't blame yourself. I hate it when you screw up. Much better. C-Claudia. No. Don't do this to me. Don't you do this to me! For a thief. You were the best of us, Claudia. The best of me. I'll miss you. It's a dark week for the department. Two detectives killed in the line of duty. Don't mention Stanley Ferris and Claudia in the same breath. We're closing the case, Detective. We have the jewels. He's not here to defend himself. Let's let them both rest in peace. He killed my partner. The public needs us all to be white knights, heroes, to put our lives on the line... for less than they pay garbage collectors. We're not all heroes, Nick. We're human. We make mistakes. Don't put the department through hell for this. Give it some time. You'll see I'm right. Shall we shake on it, Lieutenant?
