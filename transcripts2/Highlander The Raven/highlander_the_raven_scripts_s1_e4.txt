 Hold it, hold it, hold it in that spot! Okay, half an hour. He's moving. I'm on him. Mike! That's not the deal we agreed on, Mr. Norris. - It's not like it's your money. Things change. I've run into some problems. That's unfortunate, but it has nothing to do with our agreement. Take it or leave it. You're putting me in a most uncomfortable situation. No!

 Freeze! Drop it. You're very good. I didn't see you. My name is Marta Antonescu. I'm cultural attach? to the Romanian Embassy, and I claim my diplomatic immunity. She is immortal. A thousand years old and she cannot die. A creature of legend... like the raven, a thief who stole the sun and the moon. They sent a warrior to bring her back. He found her. Together, they brought back light to the world.

 I was a cop. To me she was just a thief, another day on the job. But she wasn't-- She changed my life, changed everything. And both of us knew from that moment on, nothing would ever be the same. Amanda. Do I know you? Stefan Collier. I'm sorry. I don't remember. You don't know me, but I know you. I do. - Do tell. - Born in Normandy, early ninth century. Your mentor was Rebecca. Your preferred method of sword fighting these days... is light broadsword with a little hapkido. - Should I be flattered? - It's all right there. See? I nearly caught up with you in France a few years back, but you quit the circus and disappeared. It's taken me this long to track you down. - And now that you found me? - I'll be taking your head. Just like that? Well, did I accidentally acquire something of yours, or kick your dog or something? - It's not personal, Amanda. - It is to me. Well, it shouldn't be. It's how I work. The more heads I take, the stronger I become. Yes, I'm quite familiar with the concept. I've determined the statistical probability of successfully taking your head. And suffice to say, at this juncture, I'm stronger than you. If I believed in astrology, I'd say the planets were in alignment. - And which one are you from? - Charming sense of humor. If you hurry, you can make it back to the asylum by dinner. Very funny. Oh! Amanda? Amanda. What? What happened? Oh, well, you know, I found the perfect sweater to go with my gray pants. It seems that a girl can't even go shopping without being assaulted. Who was it? No one. Really? Lucy, just leave it alone, okay? Maybe I can help. You really wanna help me? Well, stop thinking that my life is your business. Excuse me? Lucy, you know, sometimes things are just too much. And right now you are too much. Can't you go see your niece in Cleveland or something? Or-- Or just go somewhere so that every time I turn around, I'm not tripping over you? Put it up, man. Nothing but net. Come on, baby. Pass! Hey, hey, whoo! Nick. Good one. Ho ho! Break. Nick? You screwed up. Where is it? Cops said they found nothing at the scene, so let's have it. Come on. Where's what? Are you trying to be funny? It's not a good joke. Come on. You want me to be funny? Okay. Here's a joke. You hire me to trail a guy who's selling international secrets. I found myself in the middle of an international incident. You're not in the middle-- That's funny. You're not in the middle of anything. Well, you just forgot to tell me she was a diplomat? That's it? The people paying us insisted on a need-to-know basis. Gordon Norris was hip-deep in debt, selling out his own company. That's all you needed to know. I thought the Cold War was over. Technically. We have no official enemies. But see, that's the nature of industrial espionage-- you get to be screwed by your friends. Yeah, I know the feeling. Okay, now gimme the plans. Where are they? Come on. They're inside the tube. What are they? Phase two. Of? Even if the technical crap made any sense to me, I couldn't explain it. All I know is that 15 years of U. S. -backed "R & D" is heading overseas... because Gordon Norris has a gambling jones. Had. Gordon Norris is dead. Nothing you could have done about that. Yeah, maybe. Don't ever lie to me again. What do you want me to do, apologize? Okay, I'll apologize. Nick, I'm sorry I lied to you. You're right. Oh, by the way, we have another situation. Oh, no, no, wehave nothing. The job's not quite done. I am. Catch you later. Go away. You got a problem, you take it up with your buddies at the State Department. Well, I tried there, but they can't break into a foreign consulate. That's it? What, did you get dropped on your head as a kid? Come on. You got the plans. What else do you need? We've only got phase two. Phase one is still somewhere in Marta Antonescu's consulate. And in this delusional fantasy of yours, you want me to break in and steal phase one. - That's it, right? - Well, she's a murderer, Nick. - With immunity. - So the only way to get her... is to get her where she lives. I can get you in there. All you need to do is find the plans and bring them out. Right. Marta Antonescu takes one look at me, and she puts a bullet in my spine. Nope. Marta will still be downtown answering questions. What about her diplomatic immunity? Got a little tangled up in red tape. Look. We really need those plans, Nick. I really need those plans. It's personal. How long can she stay lost in the system? Thirty-six hours. Maybe 40 with a little extra pressure. She's not your problem. Leave her to me, okay? Oh, did I mention it's a two-man job? No, no, no, no. I work alone. It's the only way in. You need a wife. Hey, I like being single. See, it's a party at the consulate. Some kind of a thank-you weekend for a dozen couples who contribute to the new Romania. What can I say? I'm a real humanitarian. Actually, not you. It's your wife. - I thought we could maybe use Laura. - No, no, not her. - How about Jamie Devlin? - Isn't she still mad at me? Oh. Well, you got someone better in mind? You still here? You almost had me there, Amanda. What do you mean? Picking a fight to get me to leave. I was not. You do it all the time. Whenever your back's against the wall and you have no place to run, you push everyone away. Now, that's a good defense. It just doesn't work with me anymore. You know what, Lucy? You're brilliant. You've got me pegged. Now get out! First I wanna know who's in town and what they want from you. You don't know him. I don't know him. His name is Stefan Collier. And, for some reason, he's chosen me as his next target. Why? Because the nexus of the planets are in alignment. And Mercury's in retrograde. How the hell should I know? He's a nutcase, and I want you out of here. I was just about to make us some lunch. Lucy! Now don't you use that tone with me! You don't understand, do you? He knows my history. He knows my fighting style. He knows my bra size, for God's sake. He's gonna come here to find me, and I want you out. You don't think you can take him? If you stay, so do I. Oh, Lucy, you make me crazy. Yes, and that's what you pay me for. Amanda? You're right, Amanda. Let's both leave. I can't run from him forever. Well, run today and fight tomorrow or next month. Amanda. Okay, you win. Knock knock. Who's there? Sweetheart? Amanda, come out and play! Hey, Janet. Hey, where we going? I got a job for you. Fine. Let's go. "Let's go"? That was too easy. Can we go now? Please. Please. All right, Amanda's friend. Let's see who the D. M. V. says you are. Welcome, Stefan. Connecting to satellite uplink. D. M. V. search enabled. Searching. Search complete. You want me to do what exactly? Breaking and entering, safecracking, robbery-- the usual. Ah, gee, I don't have a thing to wear. Don't worry about that. I'll send you everything you need. What is that, a size three? Aren't you sweet? Now why do I have this feeling that I'm gonna have my ass shot off? If they're shooting at you, they're shooting at me. All right, what's our cover? Mr. and Dr. LaSalle. Dr. LaSalle. I've never played a doctor. Better watch out, Myers. She might cut out your appendix. Will you excuse us for a second? Mm. May I have a word with you? Are you out of your mind? She's perfect for the job. She is a criminal. She can get in and out. She's blonde. A blonde criminal. She's never been convicted. You know what, guys? I'm gonna go. Wait. If she's out, I'm out. Okay. Okay then, where are the real LaSalles? Tony and Christine? In Boca Raton. Poor things, their G-4 got stuck on the tarmac. Real shame how that happened. Now here's everything you need to know. And by the way, you're newlyweds. - We can do that. - No, wait a minute. I didn't agree to that. She'll do it. Don't worry. It's a done deal. No, I won't. No, no, it isn't. No. Yes, it is. Listen, you lovebirds. You've exactly two hours. Let me know. It's either her or someone else. This is a lame plan and a sophomoric idea. You're still doing it. Why should I? Because I'm irresistible. Get over your big self. Because I need the best, and that's you. Now you're getting a little warmer. And because it's in a secured building, two days. Armed guards, security. Or you could play Zorro with that guy you're running from. You don't miss much, do you? No, I don't. I'll let you know. Holy ground. Very clever. It's weird, isn't it? Almost as though I know where you're gonna be before you get there. You know, Stefan, I think you should find someone else to fight. But I can't, Amanda. You're next on the list. Look. See? The numbers are perfectly clear. You know, I've had men come after me because they love me, and men come after me because they hate me, but I've never had anyone come after me because I'm a blip on their flowchart. Look. It's all so black and white. If I move on to the next Immortal, it screws up my calculations. You can see that, can't you? How did you ever function before computers? Abacus, but the results were the same. There is reason and order to everything in my life. It is essential. I like things neat. Did anyone ever tell you you have the loveliest skin? Ow. You are one sick puppy. Yes. I've been called that before. There was a lovely man-- Artemis Lowe? - Never knew him. - Shame. Right after my first death, he took me in, showed me how to fight, helped me make order out of chaos. He was like a father to me. And still, he never quite understood why his time had come. You killed him? The risk-reward ratio made it viable. He never even saw it coming. You're good, Amanda. But I'm better. Wherever you go, I'll be there. Well, this is very nice. And where will you be sleeping? Who said anything about sleeping? Spoken like a true newlywed. Shouldn't you be casing the place or something? Okay. Ah, voila. - Parabolic mike? - Mm-hmm. And I bet these are antistatic gloves. Very good. - Ah? - Dental floss. Filament line, 500-pound test. Your friend Myers knows his stuff. And he is so good with dresses. Wow. - Who knew? - What'd you get? My dinner jacket and a note warning me not to trust you. Well, that's no way to start a marriage. Hey, sweets. Whoa, man. You're dead, man! Shut the hell up, man. Don't I even get a phone call? You could get me out of this if you wanted to. You're right, I could. At what cost? I get what you stole. You get a nice apartment. Maybe a sports car. Would red make you happy? I'd still have to stand trial for murder? With a good lawyer, you might beat it. Hmm. I don't like the odds. Don't eyeball me. It's a good life here, Marta. It's worth the gamble. You don't change, do you, Bert? You still assume I want what you have. Sorry. My mistake. Guard? We're done here. Take her. What now? As soon as we straighten out your paperwork here and get you uptown-- Uptown? You're being moved to a woman's facility. A lady like you shouldn't have to spend the night in a place like this. No. No, I demand my phone call. I hear they have real nice phones up there. You can't do this to me. Make a real woman outta ya, huh? I am Marta Antonescu... of the Romanian Embassy. Yes, ma'am, and I'm Cleopatra, Queen of the Nile. So how does it feel to be a thief? Oh, I get it. You get to be clean. It's for a good cause. This is it. No, it's not. You know, with all the expensive equipment, you'd think that Myers would find a better ring than this. You're a doctor. Buy a new one. And they say romance is dead. It's just a piece of metal. Actually, it symbolizes eternity. Yeah, well, eternity's overrated. You're telling me? You were married. I'm right, aren't I? - Ah, there it is. -How do you know? I've seen that security system before. It was first used by the Mossad headquarters. I beg your pardon. - You seemed to have lost your way. - Have we? This area's off-limits. - Off-limits. - For security reasons. Oh, of course. If you'll follow me. Just keep her for a while. Thanks. She's loaded up. She should be arriving uptown around 9:00. And they'll move her again. Mm. Anything else you need? Just keep her off balance, that's all. Who are you? The Easter bunny? Ah, here are the lovebirds. Bonsoir. Bonsoir. Now, you two have been married how long? Not long. Seems like forever. Um, I understand you gave up private practice for research, Doctor. Yes, I'm studying the immunology of rare tropical diseases in the rain forest. Ah, really? Mm-hmm. Before I joined the diplomatic service, I worked in Belize. Such a small world. Hmm. Are you familiar with Von Stern's articles... on the native grasses of the subtropics and their uses in hemotropic diseases? It is my bible. Darling, you remember Von Stern? He's one of your biggest fans. Like it was yesterday. Hmm. They're playing our song, sweetheart. Would you mind if I took my new bride for a dance? Thank you. You love to take chances, don't you? Mm. Always, don't you? Compared to? I guess being immortal makes your life a little more complicated than mine. Mm, not tonight. Where did you learn to dance? 84th Street Gym. It's easier without the gloves. You're staring. Of course. Let me give you my card. Hmm. I seem to have misplaced my wallet. What could I have done with it? Where is it? Maybe you should, uh, frisk me, Detective. You picked his pocket? I bet you didn't even see when. Isn't that what you brought me here for? No, not to steal wallets. Oh, no, we're here to steal international secrets. That's much more ethical. Find Frank. He'll have me out of here in an hour. You can't keep moving me around like this. Honey, if I had 10 bucks for every time I heard those words-- Stop here, ladies. Guard? Something bothering you? Is that real? Is that? A real sapphire, yes. Move along, ladies. What, you've never seen anyone dust for prints before? Not with a makeup brush. Mm-hmm. Just throw it in the flowerpot. He'll never know the difference. Son of a bitch. Thank you. Maybe I should go first. You don't trust me? I don't like to follow. It's a character flaw. Especially for a cop. Ex-cop. Exactly. Access by fingerprint only. Okay. We have exactly 56 minutes until the next security check. Are you thirsty? We don't have time for this. - How the hell did you know? - It's the brand. You might as well put up a neon sign that says "Here's the safe. " Really scary. What's the time? We've got 54 minutes, 20 seconds. Yo, let me outta here. I'm getting carsick. Yo, we need some help with this one. Oh, man. Somebody have some keys, please? Mary Margaret Kelly. Your lawyer posted for you. You're free to go. Ground is clear. Your job was to find me and get me out of there. I don't pay you to take no for an answer. Amanda. Ah, they've customized the damn tumblers. It's pressure as well as the numbers. If your friend Myers had given us the combination, we'd be out of here by now. We don't need Myers. We have you. - Time's up. - Thirty seconds. We don't have 30 seconds. Do you know what they'll do to me if anything happens to those plans? They're still here. That son of a bitch didn't get them. We're cutting our losses. Tell Divaj to make arrangements. I'm flying home. Yes, ma'am. We have to get to her before she leaves. Nick, it's over. We lost. No, not yet. A good thief knows when to cut and run. She knows what you look like. She could have us both killed and bury us in the garden, and no one would know. - We'd know. - You don't get it, do you? You're expendable. You're not even here. What? Nothing. You're really bailing on me? We're done. No, we're not done. You agreed to do this job. I don't give a rat's ass if some Immortal's chasing you. You take a job, you stay with it. Watch closely. This is me leaving. Find someone else. He's out there, isn't he? Isn't he? Okay, go. "Go"? So now you're telling me I can go. You heard me. Why did you have me do this in the first place? You don't trust me. I'm not even sure that you like me. So what is it? You're good. Myers gave you a long list of good people. You could have had anyone. But you insisted on me, didn't you? Because I'm immortal. I don't have time for this. Anyone else can die, can't they? Like Claudia. Leave it alone. I am the only way you won't have to lose another partner. Except you just figured out I can die. I could die here tonight. Okay. How do we get her? She'll be carrying it on her. I'll take the chauffeur and the bodyguard. - You can have Miss Antonescu. - Oh, thanks. I'm flattered. Wait. One moment. Miss Antonescu needs to get her ass in gear. We'll have to be ready to grab and run. Yeah, we'll, uh, take the limo. We'll disappear in a hail of bullets like Bonnie and Clyde. Bonnie and Clyde died in a hail of bullets. Oh, you think so, huh? - Nick. - What? Go. Go on. Get outta here. I can handle it. What the hell are you doing? You don't have to fight him. Run. I'm sorry. Amanda. It's time, you twisted bastard. What did you do? Come on. She's getting away. We can argue about it tomorrow. You son of a bitch. You cannot do that. Thank me later. You can't interfere. He was about to slice your head off. Besides, it's not like I killed him. It's more like "Immortus interruptus," or something like that. He'll be back. And besides, one job at a time. Nick, listen to me. You cannot interfere. Fine. We'll talk about it on the way to the airport. Unless you'd rather stay here and have chips and dip with the party guests. Hey, you there! Stop! Call the police! Oh, man, this day can't get any worse. Come here. Good news and bad news. I got three teams I can spare. Don't tell me. Get more. - There are six airports in the county. - Oh, that's a big help. Are you sure she has the plans with her? - She has the plans. - Hi, Amanda. Having fun yet? Oh, a laugh riot. You know, we can save ourselves some trouble. She knows that we're gonna be watching the airports. Yeah, but she's in a hurry. Helicopter. What, a chopper to Bucharest? Now that's some flight. No, not Bucharest, Bermuda. She'll get a jet there. Call in the cavalry, Myers. I'm on my way. Something you wanna say to me? Yeah. Take a left at the gas station. So who was he? What, you shoot first and ask questions later? Who died and made you hero? - You've known him a long time? - Just met. And he wants to kill you? That's the game, Nick. The game has rules. You don't interfere. I just did. You can't save me from this, so don't try. I don't get it. You can live forever, but you go around... whacking each other's heads off, and you call it a game? What would you call it? Good guys, bad guys. Cops, robbers. It's all a game, Nick. Yes, okay. As soon as possible. Pilot says 20 minutes. Not good enough. How will you explain your failure? I'm not allowed to fail. I'll put the plans we have in the engineer's hands and declare victory. If they can't make it work, it's their heads, not mine. But you're going home with the job half done. We're five million dollars into this, Divaj. If I lose what we have, I won't get a parade. I'll get a bullet in the brain. Remember to fire the pilot when we get home. This had better be him now. Hold it! Freeze! I'm not armed. Don't shoot. -Hi there. - Who the hell are you? I'm with him. We'll take those plans. My name is Marta Antonescu. I'm cultural attach? to the Romanian Embassy. And you can tell Bert Myers I claim my diplomatic immunity. Diplomatic immunity, my ass. Nice shot. It's easier without the gloves. Good work. You can leave her to me now. Our pleasure. Oh, God. Where the hell are you going? Unfinished business. You've gotta be kidding. Look. He's not going away, - and I'm tired of running. - You need help? It's the game. My game. We're all clear here. I'm fine. So, what happens now? It's up to you. I still have immunity. Not when you return home without the plans. Well, I'm not staying here and going to prison. There are worse things, Marta. They'll give me another chance. I hope you're right. You say that like you mean it. Bye. You let her go? She's a murderer, and you let her go home? We have what we wanted. No, you have what you wanted. I wanted her to do life. Not with immunity. Not here. But back home, a woman loses five million hard currency on a botched deal, some places they call that treason. It's enough to get you shot. I gave her the choice. She picked the hard way. She always did. Something else you're leaving out? Nothing relevant. Tell me anyway. She's my ex. Nick, you never get used to it. What's it for? Uh, some ritual combat about nothing. Not even about right or wrong. Not to them. I'll open some champagne. You're okay. I better go. Sure. Whatever. You are okay? Hey. Um-- Let's do this again sometime. Closed-Captioned By Captions, Inc. , Los Angeles Subtitles ripped by Ziina
