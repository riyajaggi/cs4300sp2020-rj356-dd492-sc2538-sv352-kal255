 Highlander: The Raven (1998â€“1999): Season 1, Episode 3 - Bloodlines - full transcript 
 While on a security detail, Nick prevents the assassination of a politician. He is forced to shoot the would-be killer, who then falls to his death from atop a building, but when the assassin's body disappears, Nick suspects that he is an immortal. He asks for Amanda's help in tracking him down, but Amanda is hesitant to assist him, as she was friends with the immortal, Morgan Kenworth, in a past life. In flashback to 1897 New York, the son of Kenworth is murdered while he is speaking at a union rally.

 There she is. Her highness is on the move. In position, guys. That goes for you too, Nick. Come on out front. You got anybody inside of those? Do you think Congress will approve your merger with National Cable? Did I tell you how to be a cop? Don't tell me how to do security, okay? - Is that a yes or a no? - Don't be a pain in the ass. We ran a sweep an hour ago. Our mission at News World Media is to bring objective reporting to the world. How can Congress disapprove of that?

 Radio, newspapers, magazines, now cable television-- wouldn't you call that a monopoly on the news? I call that smart business. If you're allowed to take over this cable company-- You have any comments? No. - Ms. Grady, please. Any comments? - No more comments. - Just one more question. - Gun! Get down! Luke, give me a hand! Fingers go right here. Don't move until an ambulance comes. Got a shooter on the roof! Southeast corner! But that's-- Nick, wait! Freeze! - Stop! We'll bring the coroner in in a few minutes. Stay back here, please.

 See if that blood type's a match. Look, Nick, you needed a job, I gave you one. But don't ever screw with my team again, okay? Bert. What? We got him. Right. Wegot him. Yeah, we got him. Wegot him. Hmm? Okay. Come on. Let's grab a beer. You're buying. You'rebuying. I'm always buying. She is immortal. A thousand years old and she cannot die. A creature of legend... like the raven, a thief who stole the sun and the moon. They sent a warrior to bring her back. He found her. Together, they brought back light to the world. I was a cop. To me she was just a thief, another day on the job. But she wasn't-- She changed my life, changed everything. And both of us knew from that moment on, nothing would ever be the same. It's just a crease. You're a lucky woman. Lucky? Last thing I remember, some screaming lunatic was all over me. I make a lousy first impression. Nick Wolfe. He saved your life. - That son of a bitch really meant it. - What son of a bitch? A major uplink in 48 hours with a five-continent simulcast, and I'm hardwired to a bedpan. You said "son of a bitch. " What son of a bitch? Some yahoo sent me a letter-- anonymous, threatening. The usual. You ever seen this man before? Never. That's him? - Dead? - Yeah. Yeah, he's dead. - So, who is he? - Well, it's hard to say. No I. D. on the body? No body. What? We just heard from the boys at the morgue. The body's disappeared. As far as I'm concerned, you can have the computer age. It used to be all you needed were steady hands, the right perfume, a low-cut blouse. The personal touch could get you in and out of anything. Now everything's wires, hardware, bits and bytes, electronic worms. You can keep modern technology. I'll take the good old days. Come on. Oh, no. I had a cocker spaniel who could do better. With a blindfold? The room will be pitch-black. Ah. Excuses, excuses. Besides, the alarm wasn't fully deactivated. Really? - Your stun gun? - Mmm. Voila. And to think I used to admire you. I'm tired, darling. - And bar the door. Nick! What a pleasant surprise. Why, it'sNick. Come on in,Nick. Why, Amanda, can you believe how long it's been... since we've seenNick? Nick. - Yeah, so I've heard. - It's great to see you. Um, come in. Would you like some coffee or, uh, a grape maybe? I'll peel it for you. I was wondering if you could do something for me. Sure. Have you ever seen this man before? No, never. Take a closer look. -Is he an Immortal? I told you-- I've never seen him before, all right? Uh. Let me explain that. I've never seen him before. So you've never seen him before. Take this. I-- Yeah. Okay. So he's not an Immortal. Nick, how would I know? It's not like we're listed in the yellow pages. Just because something weird happens, it doesn't mean that it's one of us. Why are you being so defensive? I'm not defensive. You're being defensive. You've never seen him before? Didn't I just say that? - Where are you going? - Hey, you've never seen him before. The lady's still alive, and, if he is an Immortal, she may not stay that way. Thanks for your help. My pleasure. Not that I was eavesdropping. Oh, no, no, no. That would be rude. Exactly. But? Amanda. Hmm? My darling. Yes? You're not even lying well anymore. Lucy, when I want your opinion-- You'll get it. Now, what are you going to do? Ah. I'm going to consult the Immortal yellow pages. Hello? Ah, Morgan. For you. Just a little gift. Did you make this for me? Sorry. Didn't hear anybody. Hello. Um, actually, I'm wondering about this artist. Morgan Kenworthy. Ah, that's right. Is he in today? Sorry. Not today. Mm. Tell you what-- I'm gonna take this vase. And perhaps I could have his phone number? No. We don't give out-- My card. Tell him to give me a call. And tell him it's about a hundred-year-old silver bracelet. Oh. We're not into antiques. Honey, you're talkin' to one. I like your hair. It's really cute. Michael Crawford, 340. Michael Crawford, please call 340. Nurse, give a hand here, please. Hello? It was him! The dead guy! He was dressed as a doctor. Oop! Sorry. Fifteen to I. C. U. , please. -Fifteen, I. C. U. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Sorry, guys. Okay, my mistake. Congratulations, Nick. You finally graduated to "major pain in the ass. " Here you go. Yeah, well, I owe it all to you. Thanks for coming down here. Hey, it's only my day off. She's checking out of here, you know? Good for her. You got any men you can spare? I'll check with the boss. Why? You got a job? You talkin' about Denise? She needs protection. Nick, we got the shooter. You were there, remember? Is that a yes or a no? It must be tough losin' your partner. A thing like that could really throw a guy. You take any time off after? Come on, Nick. Take a week now. Hell, make it a month. Just take some time off. Wait a minute. Are you firing me? Am I fired? Nick, you need a rest. Recharge-- get laid, do whatever. You did good, Nick. Come on. Door's always open for you. You know that. Amanda. I got your message. Oh. It's so good to see you. It's certainly a happier occasion than the last time. Yes. Glad to see you weren't too distracted to make it here. Sorry, Father. Late for your own speech. I mean, that's a fine example to set. That's my fault, I fear, Morgan. Ah, well. Well, don't just stand there, my son. Go on in, inside. For luck. Yes. Amanda, here. For you. Just a little gift. Did you make this for me? Yeah. He's here. We've been waiting for you. My son is happy. I haven't seen him happy for a long time. William carries a heavy burden, but you-- you make it light. Thank you, Morgan. It's beautiful. Shall we go inside then? Yes. Are you tired of Tammany Hall... and its greedy gangs of political cutthroats? Yeah! Yeah! Are you tired of them lining their pockets with your money? - Murderer! - -You killed my Johnny. - Stand back. - Somebody do something. No, no. Murder. That's what it is. You kill with your damn words. Reform. Revolt. Johnny's death broke my heart, Jack. - And he died for nothin'. -Your son was a fine young man, Jack. We mourn him, and we will miss him, but you are wrong. He died so Mueller there wouldn't have to go home to a dying wife... because he can't afford medicine. He died for me. He died for you. He died for all of us. If you want to take my life for his, I can't stop you. But it won't bring your son back, Jack. Please. Please. Give me the gun, Jack. Help us fight. Help us win. For Johnny. For all of them. He's inside. You know what to do. Now, for 40 years, we've watched these corrupt political bastards... steal and cheat and kill. -Are we gonna let them run wild for another 40? - No! No! It's the police. Grady's boys? We'll follow you. We're with you, Will. We believe in you. Well done. You're our man. What shall we do? Keep William here. I'll go check the back. - Good on you. - We believe in you. Seal this entrance. Don't go out that way. That's the police. No, Father. No more running. No more hiding. Kenworthy. At last. Your time for justice is now at hand, Grady. No! Oh, my God! William! He shot him! Grady! You murdering bastard! He killed him! No. My darling! Oh, no! What-- Oh, no. Not him. Please, God! Morgan. My William. Oh! We can't help him now. Wait. I should be dead. No. I'll explain to you later. We have to go. Oh! Oh, William. They'll pay for this, William! I swear they'll pay for this! William. Their time of justice-- Morgan. No! Leave me alone! Morgan! Murderers! Morgan! I'll get my revenge! "Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me. "Lord, be Thou my helper. "Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing. "Thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness. " That he may bless and deliver all the souls of the faithful... to holy life and eternal rest. - No! No! Oh, no! Get him! Fetch a doctor! Morgan, where have you been? Could you believe that bastard came here after killing my William? It's all over with now. No. It'll never be over. I think he went this way! There's so much I need to tell you. There's so much you need to know. We have to meet later. Where will you be? It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. - Morgan! - Move it! Morgan! Come on! Over here! Catch him! Past the graveyard! He went that way! Over there! This way! That was a long time ago. It was yesterday. That man who's after you? He's a friend of mine. I'm not interested in him. It doesn't matter. He's interested in you. So? So, I think that you should forget about Denise Grady and get out of town. - I will. - Hmm. When she's dead. This is absolutely ridiculous. You're telling me we spent 13 million on a transponder, and the uplink isn't ready? What kind of crap is this? I want that bird up on time, or it'll be your ass in orbit! Here she is, back to work. Fine! News never sleeps. What's up? I'm a little curious about something. "Newly elected senator, Thomas Grady, "tragically shot down. Son of murdered police captain Russell Grady. " - Keep going. - "Both were killed after receiving an anonymous letter. "Your-- Your time of justice is at hand. " Yeah. My face is all over the news. Figured some wacko poked around in my past. Yeah, could just be a copycat. Correction. Dead copycat. But you did see somebody there, right? I don't know who I saw or what I saw. But it wasn't him, because he's dead. Who knows? Maybe I'm cracking up. Hmm? I'll tell you what. If I'm right, you stay alive. If I'm wrong, you stay alive. Okay. I'll wait downstairs till someone gets here. $500. What? That's my deposit on a boat in Cabo. I know. I'll make it up to you, okay? This is my first weekend off in six months. Margaritas, senoritas, more margaritas. What the hell's going on? The lady needs our protection. You're her best choice right now. Yeah, right. You owe me, man. Now get the hell outta my way and let me do my job. I'll take the night shift. Thanks, Bert. See ya tonight. Hmm. William was five when I found him alone, begging in the streets. So small. But even then, I could see his strength, his goodness. People loved him, Amanda. He was-- Well, he was their hope. He was my hope-- my son. And that bastard Grady... stole all he could have been-- would have been. Morgan, Russell Grady killed your son, and you killed Grady. You've had your revenge. When they murdered William, they murdered his future, his heirs, all that would have come from him. They made it like he never was. So now I return the favor. The best of each generation dies. Are you out of your mind, Morgan? One person's death may be justice, maybe. But not this. This is wrong. For years, I wondered... why I was immortal, why I lived and William died. This is why. Wait here. - Who is it? -It's me, Nick. Uh, Nick, uh-- It's really not a good time for me to talk to you right now. I'm sorry. Just open the door. I'm actually getting ready to take a bath, so it's no good. Amanda, open the damn door. Would you just go away. -I'm not goin' away. - Well, I'm not opening the door, so good-bye. - Hey! Are you proud of yourself, tough guy? It won't do any good killing me. He dies, you die, Morgan. Amanda, don't do this. Nick, you stay out of this. This is Immortal business. Immortal, my ass. He's trying to kill her. Sorry. - Thank you. - Get out of town, Morgan. I got no fight with you. I mean it. I knew you were lying. Congratulations. Oh, no, but that's not enough for you. Why don't you just electrocute me? So, that's the thanks I get. "Thanks"? Are you crazy? Well, obviously, if I was trying to save your life. Oh, please. You're killing me with kindness. That's a hell of a lot more than Morgan would have done. I could have handled Morgan. Oh. Lucy, Lucy. Oh, so, why, because, um, you boxed for a couple of years? Because you, uh, were a cop? You think you're ready to take on an Immortal? Here, Nick. This will help the pain. I'm looking at my pain. All right, let's hear it. Let's hear what you were gonna do. So you were gonna shoot him, and-- He's gonna get up, you know. So, what do you do? You shoot him again, and then what happens? Oh, Lucy. I'm bored already. Whatever it takes to bring him in. Nick! Are you stupid? Do I have to put up a neon sign? He's an Immortal. It's none of your business. No. Ow. It's murder, okay? That makes it my business. The guy's a silversmith? What are you talking about? This is his hallmark. Oh-- That's a coincidence. Lying is pathological with you, isn't it? Thanks for the aspirin, Lucy. All right, fine. Just go out there, get your ass killed. If you don't care about it, then why should I care about it? You know, you really should get that door fixed. Somebody could break in. No! Not the Baccarat! Hey, Nick! Lucy, I'm in a hurry. I'm sorry to hold you up. I just need a couple of minutes. Can it wait? Nick, some people are proud. They don't often say what they really feel. They keep everything in here. But if they're your friend, they're your friend for life. They will do anything for you-- lie, cheat, steal. Kill... if they had to. Doesn't mean they're not a pain in the ass though. I don't want Amanda to lie, cheat or steal, okay? Especially not for me. Well, just her way of makin' nice. Thanks. I'm telling you. Somebody's coming for her. Not from where I'm sitting. Myers, this is for real. He's coming for her. He's coming to kill her. She's in danger. Listen to me. I want you to check the house. - Get off your ass-- - All right, all right. Relax, man. I was supposed to be fishing right now. Ms. Grady? Sweet dreams. Damn. Denise? Myers. Hey. Hey. Can you hear me? Hey. I'll be okay. Denise-- Where is she? I don't know. Okay. Okay, come on. Come on. Good. Hang in there. It's okay, it's okay. What happened? He's supposed to be dead. I know. Oh, my God! You-You knew he'd come back, didn't you? How did you know that? We'll talk later. Where-Where are you gonna go? It's okay. It's okay. I need to look for a silver pattern. A little clumsy. Effective but clumsy. What the hell are you doin' here? Would you believe browsing? How'd you find this place? The vase. Morgan Kenworthy designed it. His hallmark, it's registered. Very good. Your boyfriend's had a busy day. He's not my boyfriend. I haven't seen him since 1897. - Really? - Really. Well, he just shot a guy, in case you're interested. So don't give me the routine about this mortal and Immortal business, okay? Well, the guy who's shot, is he-- Myers. Don't worry. He'll live. I didn't come here to protect Morgan, you know. Of course not. You came here for me. It's all so clear to me now. I'm trying to keep you alive. You know what? Don't. I don't need you to save my life. I'm a big boy, okay? I can handle this myself. Stay the hell out of my way. - Don't go out there, Nick. - Nick! Wolfe! Walk away! - You don't have to get hurt! - Like Myers? I just want the woman! Oh! Aw, Jesus! You don't have the right. Denise. The senator. How many Gradys have you killed? It's justice. A mortal wouldn't understand. It's murder. Murder, I understand. Don't! Don't! Don't! Hey. Hey. Are you all right? You know, my life got really complicated the day I met you. Life's always complicated. Yeah. Maybe now it's just a little more interesting. They're playing our song. I got a dead, headless body in there that's connected to an attempted murder... that's connected to a 50-year-old murder... that's connected to a hundred-year-old murder. The police are gonna have questions. Absolutely. I think we should leave. I'll drive.
