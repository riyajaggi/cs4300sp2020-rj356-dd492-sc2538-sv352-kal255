 Did you say someone tried to hold up the Galleria? Hand over the money! You're the worst robber ever. (THUD!) Keith'? Let me make it up to you guys by stealing something I know you'll dig. Guys, check out what Keith's bought us. You don't go to the smorgasbord and just get the glazed ham, do ya'? (MOANS LOUDLY) I'm a gift to the women of the world. I hate your guts, Eric. Lion's gotta roar. (KNOCK AT DOOR) Hello? It's me. I'm sleeping.

 I'm not gonna tell anyone I swear. If you mess this up, I dunno what I'd have to do Probably kill you Who the hell would send me a cake'? SOFTLY: # Happy birthday, # dear Gary. # (ROCK MUSIC) (ENGINE STARTS) (LAUGHTER) Holy shitballs. Did someone trash the place or am I just drunk'? I'm gonna go with yes and yes. Not my precious! Oh, fuck. Check your rooms, boys. Clear. Clear. KEITH: Clear. Oh, fuck. (GROANS)

 Was it like that when we left'? Some animal has destroyed my bed! And an excellent job they've done of it. (GROANS) Why would someone do this to me'? READS: I'm pregnant, and it's all your fault, fuckhead. (TENSE MUSIC) Why are you looking at me'? Well, your bed. The note - your bed. Eric's gonna be a daddy The mother does not seem happy about it. Yeah, the mother also seems to have violent tendencies and control issues. Oh, Mandy. Yeah! That fits. (GROANS) And you're absolutely sure that when you were with her, one of your little swimmers didn't get loose and do the deed? No way. My boys, they stay bagged. And how come you didn't... you know'? Oh, he means put a condom on your penis, Eric. Yeah, I know what he means. I'm just a more go-with-the-flow kind of guy. - The flow that takes you straight to Daddytown. - (LAUGHTER) Wolf's not here - something about checking out a warehouse. We're not seeking Wolf. Seeking breakfast, are you? Well, it has been a long time since our last meal that wasn't beer Sit down. Do I know you'? I'm Keith. Keith? How's that Chinese? I wouldn't know. I'm from Swanson. We're actually here to talk to Mrs Cheryl. So why do you lot need to talk to her'? Oh, I just need some advice as to the safest way to deal with something. That something being that it appears that I may have knocked up her little sister Mandy. Christ. Is she even legal? Yes, yeah, she is of legal age. I'm not a... (CHUCKLES) I'm not some kind of monster. Right, well, we should be off on this recce, then. Hamilton awaits. Be back when we're back Same as always Good luck with all of this This'? Nothing to do with me. I'm just looking forward to Slutty Pants getting the news she's gonna be an auntie. Just be nice. So, Eric, how're you liking the idea of fatherhood, then'? Oh, you know, I'm just... just getting my head around it. The fact a wank stain like that can breed - not a good omen for the human race. Yeah, well, chances are Cheryl'll cut off his balls, so it'll just be the one kid. (LAUGHS) (ENGINE STARTS) (LOW, OMINOUS MUSIC) So, Sparky, how's your life at the Figgs estate going? Great. Great? Yeah. Really putting my electrician skills to good use. It's not supposed to be fuckin' work experience. Have you learnt anything of use about Figgs? Only that he has no idea that I exist. Sparky, it's a good thing if he doesn't notice you. You do get that, right? As your spy. Yeah. You know, the thing they do say about Figgs up there - they say that he murdered someone Yeah We do know this Yeah, well, it's messing with my head I'm spying on a murderer Sparky, he's not gonna murder you. I'm spying on a murderer during the day, and I'm hanging out with my best mate who wants to murder me at night. It's like everyone wants to kill me. What the hell are you talking about? What best mate? What? You just said, 'My best mate who wants to kill me' Oh! (SCOFFS) Weird me. Forget I spoke. Are you talking about Wolf'? He was joking. I think he was joking. There's a possibility he may have been joking. Why would Wolf wanna kill you'? Cos I'm bad at keeping secrets. Is this about your sister'? You know'? That he's the father of her child - yeah. That too. Is he still going there? Is he still dipping his wick? You didn't hear it from me. Because if he found out, he's gonna kill me. Bull-fucking-shit. It's true. Now she's up the duff. Yes. My little sister. YES. (CHUCKLES WRYLY) Oh, you are so fucked. Well, you know, technically, we're gonna be related, so, you know, you could put in a good word for me. The attack on the flat was vicious. So, look, going back - any words of wisdom as to how to soothe the savage beast, as it were'? You really should've kept your dick in your pants. (LOW, TENSE MUSIC) (CAR DOOR SHUTS) Rita! It's him! What'? Look! My Rarotonga man. Doesn't look Rarotongan. No. Yes. It's the guy that I... in Rarotonga. You were sick when I told you, so you probably don't remember. The guy you cheated on Brian with in Rarotonga. Yes, him. Turns out he's actually a Te Atatu man. Ah, so you two can see each other again. Well, no, because he's in police custody now, on this epic multimillion-dollar benefit fraud. Apparently, he's got hundreds of fake identities. Sure know how to pick 'em, Carol (!) I find it helps when I don't think about her. So, not now, then. What? Well, you're thinking about Carol now. Well, I wasn't, but I am now. Thanks, Bert (!) But you were talking about her. Well, it doesn't mean I was thinking about her. Hi, boys. Hi, Carol. Nice to see you both... together. Phineas. Oh, we've got a bit of downtime while Ted's sussing a job. Well, what if I said I think I have a job - for you. Well, us, really. You mean like a job job'? So, I met this guy. It's not important how. But the thing is it turns out he's a mega fraudster. Though, I didn't realise that at the time, but it totally makes sense (CHUCKLES) Which also isn't important. What is important is that when the police raided his house and arrested him, they found money stashed in the walls and gold bars under the shower - stuff everywhere. Oh, eh. Wow. This guy told rne that he had another place - his love shack was what he called it - up in the Waitakeres. Why'd he tell you that for'? The thing is there's no mention of the place in the article. So I wonder if they don't know about it. He kept it hidden from the police using another of his many names. So how do you know this prick? I met him on a flight. OK. I screwed him on a layover in Rarotonga. But it's just because he was charming and I was drunk and in Rarotonga. But you can't tell Brian. So there's some stuff stashed in this love shack. Yes, that's what I'm saying, and you can't tell Brian that either. Why'? Why what'? Well, why do you wanna do this job but you don't want your husband to know? Well, I... I've helped out on lots of jobs in the past - morale boosting, welcome-home parties. I even drove once. Remember'? I remember, Carol. And I always found that stuff kind of exciting. It would excite me in ways I won't go into. But it did, and I kinda miss it. So when I read the article, and it clicked, it got me excited. So,... Are you in'? (POP MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO) (ENGINE STOPS, MUSIC STOPS) You dumb shit. (BABY WHIMPERS) (WOLF WHISPERS) (ANNE-MARIE LAUGHS) ANNE-MARIE: Ooh. (WOLF CHUCKLES, BABY GURGLES) WOLF: Oh, no, no, no. No, he likes it. He likes it, eh. (BLOWS SOFT RASPBERRY) (BABY BABBLES) (CHUCKLES) Yeah, yeah. Jesus. Well, isn't this sickly sweet. (BABY WHIMPERS) How did you know I was here'? Did fucking Sparky spill the beans? It doesn't matter how I found out, Wolf; it just matters that I did. And it wasn't hard. Your bike is parked outside. Rita, I'm so sorry It's not- Save it. I really don't fucking care (ROCK MUSIC) Yeah, OK. I'm a piece of shit. I'm a liar. I- I don't care, Wolf. I don't give a shit about any of that. But if you're gonna sleep around, you need to do it better. OK? What? I guess as your mother I should ask you whether jeopardising your family for a root is wise. It's not like that. I love Anne-Marie. (SCOFFS) Nah. Yes. Then if you love Anne-Marie, you need to dump Cheryl I love Cheryl too. Bloody young people and bloody feelings. I have managed to live my entire life loving only one man. I'm not saint, but I'm only really ever loved Ted. So you have to choose - Cheryl or Anne-Marie. No. No, no, no, no. You don't get to make these decisions for me, so you can stay the fuck out of my life. (LOW, TENSE MUSIC) What situation? The one you find yourself in. You sure it's not Keith and definitely Eric. What? (SCHOOLKIDS CHATTER IN BACKGROUND) READS: I'm pregnant, and it's all your fault, fuckhead. Ew, gross. What? It wasn't you who fucked up my shit and left this note? Excuse me. lam definitely not pregnant. And anyway, how could I be pregnant to you, dummy? We never rooted. (LAUGHS) Yes, we did. No. At the birthday party, on Wolf and Cheryl's bed. Nope, never happened. Wiped from the memory banks. I'm not fucking pregnant, and we never fucked. I reckon, Bert, (SIGHS) this job could be quite good. There might be a bit of cash in it, yeah. And Carol might want to get back together with rne. Ah, it's just a job, Phineas. But it's a job in a love nest. What if it's really romantic and it reminds Carol of me? Phin, Carol's with Brian now. You know, except for when she was with this dude in Rarotonga. Exactly. Exactly what? Well, she needs a real man in her life. So... (SPADE CLATTERS) ...are we ready to go'? (UPBEAT MUSIC) It's exciting, isn't it'? It's like a treasure hunt. (ENGINE STARTS) My name is not on that note, so do we know that it is definitely for rne? We established that no one who lives here, apart from Keith, has had sex in living memory. But are you sure about that'? Yep. (INHALES) OK, well, there's something of a problem with that theory, then. But the biggest problem as I see it right now is that we're out of beer. That's a good point. You know, it could still actually be Mandy. Huh? She might just have the denials or she didn't want to admit it with you idiots there. (TYRES SCREECH) Holy shit bags. (ENGINE REVS) Fuck! (GROANS) You bastard. We have a winner. (ENGINE STOPS) Can I help you there, mate? Are you Rita West's son'? Who wants to know'? You're her son, right'? What's it to you? I need to talk to your mother. I don't think she's here right now. Wait. Did she get the cake'? What? The one I sent her on my birthday. OK, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now. OK, but could you just take her a message? Can you could that'? It would help if I knew what this was about. Does she ever talk about me'? I don't know. Who the fuck are you'? I'm your brother. It's something like Bonaparte or Bogartie, but a Maori word. Yeah, nah, there's no 'B' in Maori, Carol. Oh. Maybe it's something starting with 'P'. ls there a 'P' in Maori? You mean like pohutukawa? I do know there's a cute driveway leading up to the house and it's completely hidden the other houses, so you can sunbathe nude. Or so he said. (SIGHS) Now I can't remember where it is, and that is because I am an awful person who cheated on Brian. No, Carol, you're not awful. Just... some kind of slut nympho. Hey, hey, we should, um, try this place, eh. Oh. Pohane St. That could be it. Yes. That sounds very familiar. Exciting! (MAP RUSTLES) (CAR DOOR SHUTS) Well, are you getting in'? I've got a huge stiffy. OK. We need to talk. You sorted out your secret family yet'? Funny, I could ask you the same thing. Gary Savage. Does that name mean anything to you'? No. Should it'? (CHUCKLES) Yes. I found my birth certificate when my dad died. Father - unknown. Mother - Rita West. Your name is on his birth certificate. Really? Nothing? How old are you'? I just turned 16. I'm- I'm not after anything. I just... I just wanna meet her. It's bullshit. Yeah. Yeah, I thought that might be the case. But then I remembered something. Auntie Pat's. I stayed there for a few months, didn't I, while you were off doing something. And Dad was in prison at the time. Right? The Smith and Caughey's cock-up. When was that? Cos all I came up with was it was about 16 years ago. Wolf, whatever memory you've imagined from when you were a kid, you can't trust it. Yeah. Yeah, maybe. It's pretty hard not to trust this. Ted doesn't know. He can't ever know. It'll kill him. This... kid - he was a mistake, and I did what I needed to do to make it OK. Who's the father? What did he want? Gary? No, fuckin' Santa Claus (!) He just wants to meet you. Will you do that'? (ROCK MUSIC) I left you a fucking not saying I was pregnant, and you couldn't even be bothered to call, you dumb prick? In my defence, you didn't say who it was from. So? Well, who else have you been fucking'? Yeah, but that was quite a while ago, Krystle. So? So, who else have you been rooting since then? No one. You sure'? Cos I've been doing the dates and- Are you fucking kidding me? I'm pregnant, you cockhead. To you. So what are you gonna do about it'? Uh... What do you want me to do about it? Help me break the news to my father, for starters He doesn't know? Well, I only just realised, you know - found out. Uh, what about, you know, periods and stuff'? What about, like, sometimes you don't keep track of those things, fuckhead? SOFTY- I just thought that I was retaining water. I think it's what they call a petite pregnancy. So you're gonna be with me when I break the news to my father, Eric. (GROANS) Oh, can I at least have some time to think about it? You're just scared of my father. Well, yeah, that too. And with good reason. (FOOTSTEPS RETREAT, DOOR SLAMS) (UPBEAT MUSIC) He did say it was at the end of a dead-end road and something about a hidden driveway. (UPBEAT MUSIC CONTINUES) Over here. Oh my God. This must be it here. (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC) He described it just like this. He said it was like being deep in your own private bush. Ooh. I guess now we find the key. (THUD!) OK. Or that. (GASPS) Champagne. What about it'? It was what we were drinking when... you know... So, what now, then? Well, in the newspaper, it said he had stuff hidden everywhere. So,... There could be money in here? I guess. (ZIP WHIZZES) (BIRDS CHIRP OUTSIDE) (SLOW GUITAR MUSIC) (GASPS SOFTLY) Well, we'll get the tools, then, eh? I'll check the other cushions. Yeah. (GASPS) It'll be fine. You think'? (BIRDS CHIRP) Hi. Um, I've been looking forward to meeting you. Gary? That's your name'? Yeah. Why are you here? I wanna know who my father is, for starters. So if I tell you that, we're done'? Well, I... l thought maybe we could reunite. No idea who your dad is. It was a one-night thing. Didn't even get his name. So that's it'? Good. And if you come anywhere near my family again, you will fuckin' regret it. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) You think I'm bloody kidding'? Just ask Wolf about how much I joke about shit like that. (TENSE MUSIC) I've never been in a pub before. Really? Look, I'm sorry about Rita. She can be a bitch at the best of times, but that was a lot, even for her. Don't worry. I never really expected a happily ever after. What did you expect? I don't know. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Something that makes sense. My mum, the one I grew up with, she was awesome, but she died when I was young. My dad wasn't the greatest, but, you know, at least he tried. I never even found out I was adopted until after that. Shit. Yeah. Look, I'm not looking for a new mother. I had the best one in the world. Do you need... something? Anything? Nah. My parents, they left me their house and some money. But... if it was you... wouldn't you wanna know'? I would. (DOOR OPENS, BELL JINGLES) RITA: Here you go. Thank you. (CASH REGISTER DINGS) Are you fucking kidding'? Gary is an orphan and doesn't want a thing from you, and you treat him like shit. Bullshit he doesn't want anything. Why the fuck else would he stalk rne and demand a meeting? Oh my God. You're unbelievable. Since you two are clearly now chums, the next time you see the little bastard, you can tell him to fuck off again from me. What is wrong with you? If he shows up at the house again, I'll deny everything. He'll wish he was never born I know I do You're a coward Yes, Wolf. That's it. Exactly. I am afraid of what'll happen when Ted's life is destroyed by finding out there's a fucking baby he has no idea about. He has a right to know. And if he does ever find out, and I don't care how, I will make sure that Cheryl finds out about baby fucking Brandon. Am I being clear on that'? (LOW, UNSETTLING MUSIC) # Oh, your love is like a flower. (shouts) # Forgive my love... (LAUGHS) Yeah! CAROL: Whoo-hoo! # Whenever I desire, # things you make me do, # I do to you is loving you... Ah! # Our love, our love, our love. (LAUGHS) #You...# Man, This is the best job. You nailed it, Carol. And you look so beautiful in those overalls. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Yeah, Carol. You look... really hot. # Whoa, your love is like a flower. # Forgive my love. # Whenever I desire, # the things you make me do, # I do to you is loving you. # Cos they got me singing here. # Your love is like a flower. # Forgive my love. # Carol, is that right'? Sorry? The shower. Hmm? In the paper, they said there was gold in the shower. Right? Oh. (PANTS) Yep. A golden shower. Back to work, boys. Righty-oh. (SIGHS) Thanks for seeing me. And I just wanted to say... Root me. Root you'? Well, I'm really horny and really pregnant. No one else is gonna help rne out. Yeah, sweet. (MOANS) (GRUNTS) All right. Now I gotta go tell my dad. Well, I don't think that's necessary. About the baby. Yeah. Right. Old Franko Figgso. (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHS) Don't call him that. Hey, Daddy-o. Or that. (SIGHS) Don't worry. I'll be there to make sure you don't screw it up. OK. I'm gonna go home. Mm-hm. I'm gonna get changed into something more suitable. I'm gonna do this right. (DOOR OPENS, BOTTLES CLINK) SPARKY: Hey. Hey. FALANI: Eric. Eric! Now's not the time to panic. Yeah, I mean, he's probably gonna kill you, but there's a chance he might not. (GROANS) You don't get it, do you'? Even if he doesn't, it'll be a living nightmare, being the father of Krystle's baby. It'll be like a hell like nothing else. But Frankie Figgs will for sure kill you if you do a runner. Yeah, what about the kid you'll be abandoning? Your own son. Or daughter, obviously. Do the right thing, Eric. (GROANS) Oh, I don't want to. We know you don't want to. No one wants to. But you know, deep down inside that you should. And you'll die if you don't. (GROANS) (BOTTLES CLINK) I gotta say, I got a pretty good feeling about this job, Ted. Yeah, I'm not one for counting my cows before they hatch, but I hear you, old chap. Cows - like it. Go OK? Farming. It's where the money is. That's excellent to know, love. I don't know how I'm gonna do it when Pascalle starts walking too. Can I stop that from happening? WOLF: No. I'd do ii humanely. Babe, I know it's hard, but they're ours. Would you give it up for an easier life? (ROCK MUSIC) BERT: Oh! CAROL: Oh my God! Shit. Is that real gold? I think so. Yeah! (LAUGHS) I'm hauling fucking gold! (ALL LAUGH) Oh, who would've thought, eh? Such a big... urn, job. Yeah. It's just... crazy. So crazy. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Cami, you're rich. (LAUGHS) We're all rich. Nah, nah, nah. It's your job. We're- We're just helping. Yeah, yeah, it's yours, Carol. No, no. No way. I want a three-way. It should be split equally between the three of us. We should get it out to the car. Yeah, OK. (GASPS SOFTLY) (LOW, SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Didn't think you'd show up Hey What kind of bastard do you think I am? Ooh, I dunno - the kind who doesn't know which chick he's knocked up'? Yeah, well, this bastard sure as hell knows that now. And he's here to talk to your dad. He's not here. (CHUCKLES) Oh, fuck. Thank Christ. Oh no. (MOTORCYCLE APPROACHES) Here he is. (ENGINE STOPS) Hey, Dad. You remember Eric, right'? I'm aware of him, yes. Hello, sir. Eric's got something to tell you. You'd better come inside, hadn't ya'? Well, what is it'? Sir... I would like to marry your daughter. The fuck did you just say'? I thought you wanted rne to do the right thing. Isn't marrying you doing the right thing? Dad... Eric knocked me up. Sorry. I just wanted him to tell you so at least you'd know that I knew who was to blame. Well, I think under these circumstances, blame is usually on both parties. But I guess in this case, it's not. And you could've have dived into a better gene pool'? Hey, Dad, that sale's gone... What's going on'? Your sister here's pregnant to this chump. Ew. God. Is it too late to abort'? Adoption'? No, no, no. We don't do that. If it's too late to scrape it out, it's gonna be a Figgs. Girls, can you give me a minute'? Now, here's what's gonna happen, you miserable little tick. I know a guy, and you will go and see him. Is he, like, a lawyer or something? A doctor who will give you a vasectomy. So at least there will be no more creepy children, and I will have done the world a favour. What if I don't want to have my balls snipped? Either he does it or I do. And after that, you will never come near my family... my daughter or my grandchild... ever again. (SLOW ROCK MUSIC) (ENGINE STARTS) (LAUGHTER IN OTHER ROOM) Nah, she's doing really well, mate. I'm starting to wonder why she's even there. The cocaine, wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. You spoken to Ngaire? NO. You should. Why'? She's bored. Better than off her nut. Just popping to the Galleria. Yeah. Hi, Rita. Rude. (CAR ENGINE STARTS) Anyway, thank you both so much. It was an amazing, exciting day. I'm tingling all over. We should get going, eh. Oh. OK. Thanks, guys. Cheers, Carol. (CAR DOOR OPENS) (ENGINE STARTS) I wanted to hug her. I've got a huge stiffy again. Got any beer in your caravan? I can't do this any more. Eh? I need to move on. The next woman who comes along who I like... I'm gonna make her mine. Great plan, Phineas (!) Great plan (!) (ROCK MUSIC) Shit. Wolf says he loves you. He does. You know he's just another stupid man who's never gonna leave his wife, right? I do know that. Because he loves Cheryl too. So continuing this... whatever you two have got going on is you signing up for a life of lies and bullshit and secrets. It's better than nothing. It's half a life at best, girl. You're never gonna have someone to share the important moments with. And you can't talk about it with anyone. I get it, Rita. So why put yourself through it'? Because I love him. Ah, fuck love. Fuck whatever fantasy you've got going on in that head of yours. Because the best you can hope for, Anne-Marie, is that Cheryl finds out, the shit hits the fan, you'll go through hell, and at the end of the day, he will choose her, because he always will. That is your best-case scenario. And you fuckin' know it, don't you'? Deep down, where you don't want to admit it... you know I'm right. Get outta here, Anne-Marie. Move away - somewhere Wolf will never find ya. (SOBS SOFTLY) (INSECTS CHIRP, DOG BARKS IN DISTANCE) Carol. Brian! What are you doing'? I was just planting something. A new tree for our family. At night-time'? That's so sweet of you. Speaking of family trees, this morning, Mother was showing our young Chantal a picture of my great-aunt Esme. I really, really love you. You know that, right'? I assume that's why you married me. I want you to fuck rne - here, on the lawn. Ooh, gosh. Urn... It sounds very zany, urn, but I-I've got a bath running at the moment for the kids. Also, the kettle's on, and there's still that Onehunga weed in the lawn - prickly. OK. But next time - once I've dealt with the weeds. That would be lovely. (SLOW GUITAR MUSIC) (BIRDS CHIRP) Ted. Ah, thanks, love. Hey, Rita. Can you watch the twins for a bit this morning? I'm at the Galleria. Can you watch the boys this morning? I've got a doctor's appointment. Oh, I can't, babe. Work stuff'. Really? Yeah, sorry. (CHILDREN LAUGH IN OTHER ROOM) (DOOR OPENS, SHUTS) (ENGINE STOPS) Are they out'? Yeah. Are they coming back? I don't get it. Why'? And where? You must know something. Fuck off! (ROCK MUSIC) Where is she? I dunno. Don't fuck with me! It's part of the deal, Wolf. No clues, no contact. You're fuckin' evil. You're a fuckin' monster. I don't give a shit that you were fucking Anne-Marie, Wolf. I give a shit that you're a fucking idiot that was about to mess everything up for yourself. Just cos you had a kid outside your own marriage and regret it doesn't mean that's my story! I wanna be a part of my son's life. I'm not a fuckin' arsehole. I'm not you! I was young, and I was stupid, and I did the only thing I knew to do to keep the man I loved. So, fine, you can punish me, if that's what you wanna do, but it will ruin Ted. It's over to you. You can say that you love Anne-Marie, but you don't. You love Cheryl. You love Van. You love Jethro. You love Pascalle. Gary got a family. That's what I gave him when I walked away, and I'm not about to risk my marriage for a Christmas card once a year and the occasional awkward phone call. So, fine, you can think that I'm an evil fuckin' bitch if you want to, but it doesn't change the fact that everything I have done - everything - I have done for all of us. And I think that makes me a fuckin' saint. So, Wolf, we can choose to blow our lives apart... or we can both shut the fuck up. (EXHALES) Krystle! Krystle! Krystle! Eric, what are you doing here? Don't shut rne out, Krystle Please You can't do this to me. Oh, fuck. Leave. No. No, I have rights here. I'm the father. Girls, go inside. No, don't- don't go inside, Krystle. Please! You need to hear this. You were warned not to come back here. No, I don't care. I'm the father! Stop fucking with my life! (ROCK MUSIC) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (BONES CRUNCH) (SCREAMS) (THUD!) (GRUNTS) (TIM FINN'S 'CARVE YOU IN MARBLE) # When you asked me how does it feel... # to be loved by someone like you. # I could only answer with this song. Ah. That didn't go so well. # Many colours fill the canvas. # Will I ever catch your drift, girl? (CHERYL AND TWINS CHATTER INDISTINCTLY) # Make a shape and give the feeling form. # I will carve you in marble. # Carve you cos I love you, yeah. # I will carve you in marble. # Everyday, I crave your presence, # lose myself in tender feelings... # You've gotta piss off, mate. Nah, I mean it. You don't want anything to do with us. This family's toxic. Hey! Hey! (SHOUTS) Some oaf going through my knicker drawer. (GRUNTS) I quit. Oh, Bilkey, you're just saying that cos you're up to your knob in mud. He took something from Eric, so we take something of his. Are you scared of him, Mum'? Is that it'? You've got some bloody balls, Wolf. You fucking pack of... (GUN FIRES)
