 We have been invited to a highly exclusive event. We will be spending this Sunday evening at our neighbor Sean's Superb Owl party. Vampires have huge respect for owls. One: they're nocturnal, two: they're predators, and three: they don't give a hoot where they dump their scat. The party we're going to is celebrating the Superb Owl, who is the greatest owl of all time. Do you think we're going to get to touch its little beak?

 Depends what mood he's in. Yeah, I know it's a Super Bowl party, but I tried to correct them and they wouldn't listen. That's the owl's egg. Also, I didn't try all that hard.

 *WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS* Season 02 Episode 03 Episode Title: "Brain Scramblies" Aired on: April 22, 2020 Remember, no killing at this Superb Owl party... - Super Bowl. - ...out of respect for our good friend and host, Sean. Once this evening is over, Guillermo will have a nice assortment of virgins for us. Oh... and behave. Blend in. This is an all-human party. Hey! You guys made it! Nadja... Nandor... My man Laz... Dilbert-looking guy. So, what are you waiting for? Get your rears in gear and get in here. That counts. All right, come on! Yo, Charmaine! Look who it is. - Our European neighbors from next door. - Oh. Could you run to the ShopRite and grab a few more bags of those Tostitos Hint of Limes before you start drinking? First off, I already started. What? - What? - Now you're catching an attitude? - Right in front of our guests? - Well, this is my house. I can catch whatever I want. Why don't you go catch it somewhere else? Oh, shut up. It's always something with this one. Anyway, come on in. Listen, we're sort of a no-shoes household, - so, uh... - I'm not taking my shoes off for anyone. That's fine, Laz. Virgins, virgins, virgins... Stupid. I don't know why I always do that. You know, I've been thinking about my lineage lately, and just because I have Van Helsing blood in me doesn't mean that I'm destined to be this vampire killer. Get back! I'm sure that somewhere along the line there was an amazing baker in my family, right? But does that make me an amazing baker? Actually, I am a really, really good baker. Oh, no. The thing with motion smoothing that you have to remember is, you want it on for sporting events but off for TV and movies. Even take a football movie, like 1974's The Longest Yard, starring mustachioed actor Burt Reynolds. Dude, you're... You're blocking kickoff. Well, better to not watch the game at all than to watch in the wrong format, right? Colin, enough! They want the owl. So, do you have any knowledge of the owl's temperament tonight? Uh, I hope it's not too fussy. Who, Charmaine? No, she's always like that. What'd you say, Frankie? Oh, nothing. You still owe me $100 for that pizza night. - Oh, get out of here! - No, you don't get to talk - until you give me that pizza... - I paid you back two weeks ago. - Get off it, Charmaine! - He never paid me back. - Get off it! - 100 bucks for pizza? Ugh, Nadia, you must be miserable in here. All this testosterone. Come on. The other wives are having a little powwow in the kitchen. - Sean has more wives? - I wish. Excuse me? - Nothing, nothing. - Yeah, that's what I thought. Busted. So, how come we never see you guys around here - during the regular season? - Believe me, I tried to get 'em to hang, but they never seem to be around during the day. You know, come to think of it, I really only see them at night. It's like they're, uh, vampires or something. Get in. Fuck. You heard what he said. He knows we're vampires. Um, ocupado. Yes. Uh, we are just taking a nice shit together. I-I'll come back. I think we need to... - What, "whack" him? - Yes. No, if we "whack" him, we'll have to "whack" everybody. The place will be a fucking bloodbath. But he knows our dark secret. All right. Let's get him to a private place where we'll both hypnotize him. He'll forget everything. - Good old double hypnosis. - Yes. It's tough finding new groups of virgins. Tried joggers. Hard to catch and very sweaty and slippery. Tried incels. Definitely virgins. But very bitter, apparently. "Mosquito Collectors of the Tristate Area." Beep, beep, beep. Nerd alert. I'm kidding. They are nerds, though. They're probably virgins. Sourcing food for my master does have its benefits. It gives me a chance to search for my own food. And save some for later. So, um, how long have you guys been, uh, collecting mosquitoes for? Seems like it would take up a lot of your time and it wouldn't leave much time for anything else. Dating. What makes you so interested in mosquito collecting, son? - Well? - Uh, I love insects. Mosquitoes are an evil, deadly species. Doesn't the fact that they drink human blood sicken you? - Yeah. - Yeah? Sure about that? You guys are the ones with the mosquito club. - Just... - What about other creatures that drink human blood? Creatures with sharp teeth and stupid accents? You... Y- You mean, um, vampires? You said that, not me. You did. But yeah. Do evil, bloodsucking vampires sicken you? Yeah. Yeah. - They make me sick. - You sure about that? Yeah, I want to throw up right now. Well, brother, you've come to the right place. He's worthy. - Yes. - Yes. - Come on, guys. He's worthy. - Oh. Like we practiced. - Activate. - Yes! Huh? Holy... You guys are vampire hunters. Hell, yeah, we are. Yeah, that mosquito thing? It's all a cover. Actually, you're the first person we've gotten to do that cool reveal for. Wow. Moving around like a I-lunatic. Put a collar on the guy, you know? Great joke, assholes. - We were just saying what a beautiful house - you have. - Oh, thanks. Yes. Uh, we were also wondering if it has an attic or basement or... - Yeah. - ...dark, soundproof room you could show us? Oh, you guys want a tour. Yeah, sure. So, these steps were built by my Uncle Fulvio in 2011. And then Sean says to me, "Why don't we wait to celebrate our anniversary until after "I get back from the Islanders game? - If they win." - What? My Ronnie did the exact same thing to me, only he did it on the same day as my sister's funeral. No. - Are you kidding? - Yeah. He said that... I had completely forgotten that when a human takes a mate, the mate keeps growing and changing and aging. - He said that. - Wow. Can I ask you all, m-my ladies, you are all such strong, beautiful, vicious, vibrant women. - Yes. How did you all end up married to such boiled potatoes? You know what, though? Seanie used to be so thoughtful. He was so sweet. When my dog had to get put down, he brought me flowers for a month straight. Oh, yeah, I remember that. Yeah, what happened to us? These poor women. They take a lovely, handsome chap from the street, make him their husband, and then, in the blinks of an eye, he becomes a big, lazy sack of shit. So sad. All right. Who needs some more wine? I think that this bottle's turned, - but it'll still get the job done. - Yes, please. You love wine. - Oh, yeah. - Hey, Joanie. What, are you lost? Do you want to go back up to bed? Oh, what kind of movie are you making? - There's a camera. - Oh. You should get back up to bed. Oh, we love wine. Holy shit. - What? - It's you. I- It's you. I-I used to see you sitting up in the tree. No, Ma, this is our next-door neighbor. I'm sorry about her. This is Sean's mom. The neurologist has her on Aricept now, but when the sun goes down, she gets a little mixed up. You transformed yourself into a cat. You taught me the dance - of the ancient soothsayer. - Ooh! Calm yourself, dear. You're just feeling a little bit demented, that's all. I'm so sorry about your brain. Oh, yeah, everything she's saying is completely true. I am Nadja. Sean's mother Joanie grew up right here in this house. We used to have so much fun together. I used to pin her to the ceiling for hours. She cried and cried. - I know you. - Guys, uh, can you help get Ma back up to bed? I know her. I know who she is. She used to be such a cute, little fresh-faced girl. But now she just looks like an elephant's knee. - Okay, don't make me pick you up, Joan. - Sorry about how demented you are. Oh. And here it is. The crown jewel of the home. The world's largest collection of Ocean's Twelve memorabilia. Brad Pitt's tinted sunglasses from when he first meets Baron Toulour. Ooh! Scott Caan bobblehead, mint condish. Yeah, it's like, they did some decent world-building in Eleven, but it all pays off in Ocean's Twelve. You need to fucking stop talking about the sea. - What? - We know that you know our secret. What secret? That we are vampires. You said it downstairs in front - of all of your round friends. - I was just joking. You're not vampires. Get the fuck out of here. Yes, we are. Whoa! How are you doing this? Where are the wires? How are you doing that?! I'm thinking maybe he didn't know. So, we shouldn't hypnotize him? - No, now we definitely should. - Oh, fuck. Vampires are real. - Vampires are real! - Let the double hypnosis commence. We command - that you forget... - You forget - everything. - ...that we are vampires, please. I think it's worked. What happened? Quite all right, Sean? Uh, yeah, totally. But wh-who's Sean? Shit. He's forgotten everything. So, what are some of the terms we use for vampires? Mosquitoes. Suckers. Biters. I know that it seems like a big coincidence that I go out looking for virgins and find a secret den of vampire hunters, but this is no coincidence. Okay? It's like the universe has been trying to tell me for a long time, "Hey, Guillermo." And I've been like, "I don't know, I don't think so." But now like, "Hey, Guillermo. Yeah, dude. Yeah." Familiars are pathetic, lonely, desperate, low-IQ, sad losers. They live to do the bidding of their cruel, uncaring masters. Okay, gonna open up the floor to any thoughts and/or suggestions. Oh, um, Claude, okay. One idea that I had is, uh, that I think that we should all have sex with each other. 'Cause that way if any of us is a virgin, then, you know, we wouldn't be any longer. And then it would prevent us from being targeted - by vampires. - Derek... you need to stop suggesting that. Okay, yeah, yeah, to-totally, yeah. Knock, knock, Joanie. Miss Nadja, is it really you? Yes, of course it is me. I was lying down there. Oh, I've missed you so much, my little Joanie! So, did you have a good life? Uh, yes. I- I think so. Oh! I took a trip to Nova Scotia at one point. And did you marry that boy you liked? - Franklin? - Yeah. Oh, yes, I... Oh, wow, look. You were very beautiful for a very brief moment. Wait. Where did you get this necklace? This is my necklace. - Pardon? - The jade one in this photo. You motherfucker! It was my prized jade necklace. It was given to me by my mother when I was young, just before she was eaten by a bear. I should have known you would have stolen it! You were always a sneaky little human shit! You know, if you listen to it, you can still hear her screams. It was the type of jade that absorbs human screams. And she was really screaming. So it took it very strongly. Thieving bitch! Give it back to me! You little brat, where is it?! I don't know what you're talking about! You are a lying piece of old cabbage! But I don't know what you're talking... help! Help! I'm having an episode! Help! - She attacked me! - Oh, no, she didn't. - Oh, she-she did. - Nadia, go. Go enjoy yourself, we'll take care of her. - Ma, she didn't attack you. - She-she did. Mama? Mama? Scream for me. My mother gave it to me. She said, um, "I can't wait to see you wear this for the rest of your life every minute of every day." And then, honestly, the next day, walked out the house and bam... bear. Mama, scream for me if you're here. That is worse than a bible... That burns my eyes. Mama? Mama! Sure, the guys on the field are having a good time today, but they're not gonna be having such a good time in 20 years. That's when they'll have applesauce sloshing around in their skulls. Has anyone heard the ancient screams of a very large woman? What a throw by... The halftime show... A lot of people consider that to be the highlight. I like the commercials. I like to see what they come up with for the Clydesdales - each year. - All right, bros, who's ready for piping-hot nachos fresh from the microwave? Uh, Sean, those are batteries. It is possible to over-hypnotize, and I fear that's what we've done with Sean. You see, there's various levels of over-hypnosis. If it's not too serious, it's what's called "Weak Brain." If it's slightly worrying, it's called "Thoughtless Sallies." And if it's a fucking nightmare and you can forget about him, it's "Brain Scramblies." Yes! Yes! Go, go, yeah, no, oh, come on! How is that a yellow card?! Are you kidding me?! Typically, when a vampire turns a human's brain into pudding from over-hypnosis, the proper etiquette is to put them out of their misery... by murdering them. We're not gonna kill him. It goes against our non-killing agreement. Yes, but it is now necessary to do the humane thing and rip Sean's head off. Uh, not now. We are taking a human shit together. - Uh... - Have either of you two seen a jade necklace containing the bloodcurdling screams of my dead mother in here? Eh... oh, maybe check behind the Andy Garcia cross-stitch. No soap? Radio? Ha, bowling ball. Nandor wants to kill Sean 'cause he's got the Brain Scramblies. Well, then Nandor is correct. Have you gone soft, my sweet syrup pie? No, my sweet syrup pie, I've gone hard. - - 'Cause he's my best friend, he's my pal. He's my homeboy, my rotten soldier. He's my sweet cheese, my good-time boy. Laszlo, this is clearly what must be done. Oh, Yahtzee! For Sean's own sake. I'll go get my head-ripping gloves. No, no, no, hang on, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not animals. Let's give him one last night to remember. One magical night on Earth before we... "whack" him. Well, okay, yes, that is fair. I can feel it, guys. I mean, I really think we are, like, this close to finding our first vampire. - Yes. - Wait, so you guys have never actually... met or seen a real vampire. Well, come on, it's not like they're just walking around in broad daylight, you know? - Yeah. - Throwing a football in the park. - Seriously. - Running errands. - Yeah. - Going to the bank. - Eating a pretzel. - Yeah. - Walking a dog... - I have. My roommate was turned by a vampire. And became a vampire. She died right in front of my eyes. But then she came back to life. What the fuck?! But she was different, sick... unnatural. And eventually she just... vanished. Her future was so bright. She was such a brilliant LARPer. I think Shanice and I might have a mutual friend. Small world. This is the life. Hanging out with my three favorite gerbils. I only have one question... Are we inside or outside? - You need to focus, Sean. - Huh? And enjoy the most magical night of your life. Hold tight. What? Whoa... How are you doing this?! How are you doing this?! What's going on now?! Oh, God, no! Mother Mary! - Wait for us. - Here we come. Hey! Oh, no, no! Fuck me! Now that you've experienced the pleasure of flying, enjoy the marvel of transfiguration. What? Bat! Whoa! Where'd that asshole go?! Oh, God! Get off! Look at that, he's having a lovely time. - He loves this. - No, get out of my hair! Get out of my hair! Get...! - Sean, look at me. - No! Stop that! What are you doing? It ain't natural! Are you enjoying watching me, Sean? No! Stop it! Get down here! - Ooh, get a good look at this! - Wow! - Holy shit! - Sorry, Laszlo. But, you know, it's his last night. I don't care. And now for the grand finale. We vampires have dominion of animals. So we decided to throw you a little puppy party. What have you done?! Oh, God! Sean. We did something really good tonight. I'm proud of us. - Yes. - My boys. I haven't really had many real friends. So, when I met Jenna, my whole life changed, really. But she was taken from me. I guess I never really think about the victims or their families. Uh, I guess I switched that part of my brain off with, um, feelings and emotions. Killing vampires, killing humans, collecting victims... It's all so nasty and ugly. And, you know, I devoted my life to it, so... So that's why I'm here! Because vampires cause nothing but pain! - Hear, hear. - Hear, hear. Come on, say "aye" if you're with me. - Aye! - I have to go. I'm so sorry. - I think I left my toilet running. - You sure? Yeah. We're just about to start crossbow practice. What's that? Derek got us some mannequins to use as targets. Yeah. - Get a load of this, huh? - That's a weapon. - Yeah. - And those are vampires? Yeah, I got the costumes at a Halloween store. Okay, I don't think I'd be really... Damn, pimp! - I have to go. - Whoa! I'm sorry, is-is it just me, or is this guy an epic pimp? We'll see you on Wednesday, right? No, yeah, a- and if you don't, it was really nice meeting you. And, Shanice, I'm very sorry about your friend. And you guys should be really careful when dealing with vampires... They're no joke. Hey, hope to see you again soon, son. And not just 'cause you, you have wicked skills with the C-bow. You're a mighty cool dude, Guillermo. Thank you. Just slide it. - Yeah, push it to the left... - Yeah, you got - to throw your weight into it. - There you go, you got it. All right, we'll close it... Don't worry about it. All right. Well, that was a lot of fun, old chap. I bet you could die a happy man. He's worse than before. We've ruined him again. All the more reason to put him out of his misery. Go ahead, Nandor. Yes. Here I go. Head rub time. Forgive us, old chap. Oh, my God. Who is that piece of ass? Mamaloosha! That is Charmaine. You know her? She's your wife. Yeah. - I wish. - Seanie! I've been calling for you for, like, 20 minutes. The garbage disposal's all messed up again. You are the most beautiful creature I have ever seen. Stop messing around. I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy. This is for you. It's a token of my undying love. You emptied out a junk drawer? What the hell is wrong with you? Wha... what is this? - What? - This is beautiful. Seanie, did you get this for me? - That is my necklace. - Oh, my God, Seanie. - This is a bloody... - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Leave them to it, my darling. I suppose it is quite sweet. I'll just get it when they die. So, we didn't need to kill Sean after all. Yes, his mind has been wiped to a blank slate and now he can start a new one just focused on the amazingness of his wife and his marriage, and he doesn't remember we're vampires at all. Come on, Colin Robinson. - We're off. - Hold on a minute. I- I may have overdone it. This one just pissed himself. Who cares? Come on, let's go. So, all in all, I would say our first Superb Owl celebration was a marked success. Even though the owl didn't show up. ♪♪ Ooh, night owl ♪♪ ♪♪ Well, yeah ♪♪ - ♪♪ Here come the night owl ♪♪ - ♪♪ Ooh, night owl ♪♪ ♪♪ Oh, oh, oh... ♪♪ Can you tell me, how is it you haven't aged after all these years?

If I turned you, you would stay forever... like this.
