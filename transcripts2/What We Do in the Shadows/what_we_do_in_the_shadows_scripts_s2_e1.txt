 So, yes, it has been quite a summer. - We finally got a new familiar. - Yeah. - But he had an accident and died. - Yeah. Left a bit. Left a bit more. It's not even. Ooh. Shit. So we found another one and she had an accident and she died. Oh, fuck. I had what is known as a summer of self- discovery. I was being a vapor

 and I got sucked into an air purifier. But apart from that, pretty slow summer. And then the same thing happened with the next one. I spent so much time at the DMV they finally just gave me a license. I did what any young, handsome man would do, I went and bought a classic convertible, put the top down, blasted some tunes and, uh, I blocked the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel. This is gonna ruin my day, too, you know. - And then the next one. - Yep. We've been through about six... no, seven familiars this year. - Seven? - Yeah, remember Joey?

 No, my dear, I'm not that familiar. No, don't you remember? His intestines came straight out of his bum. - Oh, Joey. Yeah, yeah. - Mm. Not much new with me. I've been spending a lot more time in the upstairs bathroom. But besides that, my summer's been pretty mellow and... Ooh. There's this little guy. Here. I've been trying to make friends with him all summer. Don't be afraid. Come on in. Oh, sh... That's the tenth vampire I killed this month. These vampire assassins keep trying to kill Nandor, Nadja and Laszlo ever since they escaped from the Vampiric Council. I'm doing it to protect my master. But I can't tell him I'm a vampire killer, because then he'd have to kill me. Guillermo, what are you doing? - Dusting. - Well, can you dust more quietly please? - I'm trying to sleep. - Okay. I haven't slept in 72 hours. I've been eating these chocolate- covered espresso beans. They give you enough pep just to keep going and just keep going, going, going and pretend... - Ah! - Guillermo? Someone's in here! Please don't open the door. Did you make a messy toilet again? I- I did. I- I had an accident. Whoopsie. - Well, actually, I just wanted to... - No, Master, don't open... Oh, Guillermo. You should really drink more water. ♪ Don't sing if you want to live long ♪ ♪ They have no use for your song ♪ ♪ You're dead, you're dead, you're dead ♪ ♪ You're dead and out of this world ♪ ♪ Now your hope and compassion is gone ♪ ♪ You sold out your dream to the world ♪ ♪ Stay dead, stay dead, stay dead ♪ ♪ You're dead and out of this world. ♪ Anyway, that is all in the past, because we have finally found us a good one. Topher, come in here! - Look at this. - Tophie! Your skull polish, madam. - I'll be right outside. - There he goes. Take care of business. Ooh. Topher is an absolutely "Bob's your money" spectacular familiar. And his résumé is impeccable. It is. He is proficient in Excel. And went to Lehigh. Now, my wife and I have not a whore's notion what any of that means. But we like it. Need any help with that, G- Money? Nah, I got it. It's like my father used to say. "Never accept a towel from an Italian." - Yeah. Topher. - Very true, darling. - Master. - Watching you stretch your young body across that fireplace, - you know who you remind me of? - Who, Master? Me. Bring it in. You're the best. - Guillermo! Guillermo! - Y- Yes, Master? Yes? I dragged my cape through a street doo- doo again. I dragged it for three blocks before I noticed and I'm embarrassed to say I dragged it for another eight blocks after that. - Why did you do that, Master? - Well, I thought it would help, you know, drag the doo- doo off. - Anyway, take care of it please. - Hey, uh, - you want me to fly in with the assist? - No! That actually is a- a lot of shit on it. This is a good solo job for Guillermo. But thank you for the hustle, Topherino! Look out. - Hustle...? - I don't think so. - It looks fantastic in here. - Doesn't it? - I could watch him clean all day. - Yes. All right, I'm glad to hear you say that. Uh- huh. All right. All right! Bye, Bobby. It's my little side hustle. I'm a 0.5 percent owner in this dope new line of hard ciders. - It's called Doze Apples Hard Cider. - That's clever, 'cause it- - they're made with apples. Apple flavoring, - we have to say. - Do Laszlo and Nadja - know about this? - Eh. What they don't know can't hurt them. - Am I right? High five. - I... - Come on, dawg. Don't leave me hanging. - I don't know. Just... - With our job... - Dawg. Don't leave me hanging, dawg. - And we're just... - Dawg. Don't leave me hang... - I just think that... - No, give me a better one, dawg. - I just think... - Again, high five! Oh, yeah. High five. I feel like there's a way to be cool... which you are, you're very cool... - Thank you. - ...and also, respectful, you know? You need to let them know that you are worthy of being turned into a vampire someday. - Which is why we're here. - To be honest, I don't really care about being a vampire. I'm sorry, what? Yeah, yeah, I was very surprised that Topher does not want to be a vampire. Who doesn't want to be a vampire? What are you doing if you don't... - What- what do you want to be? - I don't know. Maybe a warlock. - That'd be cool. - That would be cool. That's, like, above vampire. Alla- kazoom! And it would explode or something. He's still learning. He's still finding himself. He'll get there. So, these are like money. You go to any store that sells Doze Apples Hard Cider, pay for the cider with real money, but then, you mail in this card to the address there on the back. And I can explain this whole process as I'm handing these out? Oh, yeah. Sometimes more than once. You know, if you want, you can drain me right now. I'm, like, firing on all four cylinders, you know? You can crunch up as much as you want. I can make some more. Yeah, I want to, Topher, but I'm having a pickle of a time draining you. I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Robinson. Like, I know you're trying to bore me- - Hang on. Come on in. The stuff that you tell me is just so interesting. You know? Sue me. - Who was at the door? - I don't know. Unbelievable. Topher? Topher, did you happen to let two vampires into the house? - Hey, hang on, dawg. - Look, there's a couple rules you need to follow. - I know you're new, okay, but... - Sorry, just, uh, conferencing with this guy I used to intern for, this dope werewolf- - You might know him, actually. First of all, werewolves are not dope, so I wouldn't know him. - Uh, this guy's pretty dope. - No. Look, I don't mean to be hard on you, but it's important you follow the rules for everyone's safety. Do me a favor and stay away from the koi pond. I think there's an electrical short from the heater, so just - stay away from it... - Have you tried turning it off and back on again? No, just don't touch it, Topher, okay? - The electric guy's gonna be here on Monday. - Always works for me. So just leave it alone... Yeah. I'm sad that Topher died. Another familiar dead, you know? But... that's the business. I'm used to it. That's bad, right? Death comes for us all. It comes for the bees. It comes for the trees. It comes for, uh, basically anyone from zero on up, so... one... Are you kidding? ...two, three, four. Put a cork in it, Colin Robinson. - We're weak enough as it is. - Perhaps there is - a familiar killer on the loose? - What? Well, I was just thinking, you know, if there are vampire killers, then why not familiar killers, also? There's no such thing as vampire killers, you knob lord. - Well... - What was that, Guillermo? I'm just saying that it wouldn't hurt to be more cautious and alert. Enough of this! This is horse piss. We are vampires. We can do better than this for our Topher. Guillermo, dig him up. Yes. Please be respectful of his mud. A necromancer is someone who can reanimate the dead. It's a truly fantastical part of the dark arts. And I happen to have a very good old pal Wallace... ...who is excellently proficient in the art of necromancy. No, he's excellent, at the dark art of ripping you off. These people are shysters. They're obsessed with the upsell. I'm sure his hut is around here somewhere. It's a classic necromancer scam. "Meet me at my hut." What bloody hut? There it is. I'm certain of it. Look at all those pale, desperate wretches scurrying around in the moonlight. It's a performing arts school. Hey, a high school production of Thornton Wilder's Our Town with a Q and A afterwards. - Don't mind if I do. Yum, yum. - You seek the necromancer? What the...? I am they. Hello, Wallace! Come on, everyone! - I've got a lovely pot of stew if anyone's hungry. - No. - I see you admiring my wares. Anything tickle your fancy? - No. Hush. - These bracelets ward off the evil eye. - Ooh. Ooh. - This one attracts the evil eye. - And this one increases sexual stamina. Yeah. - You could do with a leg up. - And these are key chains that look like license plates. - Uh- huh. Look, mister, we are not interested in your tricks and trinkets. This one would make a cute gift for a man named Steve. Yes, yes, yes, but, Wallace, what we are here for is we were hoping you could reanimate our beloved familiar Topher. Yes, uh, how long has he been dead? - Huh? - Oh, that is Guillermo. He is not dead, although sometimes we wish he was. Just a little joke there, Guillermo, I got it. All right, so, uh, where's the carcass? Yes. Guillermo, fetch the carcass. - The what? - The carcass. - The cadaver, man. - I'll go get the body. What was that? I'll go get the carcass. Better. And did you bring a personal item belonging to the deceased? Uh, yes, uh, his mini- fridge. Uh, Guillermo, you did bring the mini- fridge, yeah? He absolutely loved this cold, white little box. And the foot of a deranged cat, the night- thistle, the parcel of wolf's- bane and the $350 cash? - Thank you. - It's all there, razzle- dazzle man. Good, good. I can't stress enough the $350 cash. - Yeah, I'll bet you can't. - Otherwise, the spells don't work. Wallace, do you think we are going to get - our beloved Topher back? - Well, he seems well preserved. Everything seems to want to... seems to be intact. He hasn't had that, uh, intestines out of the asshole, has he? - No, no. - Good, 'cause that really yucks me out. Right, then, here we go. Hold on to your hats. Yes! You're alive! You can jive! Your spirit rise! ♪ The light has gone ♪ ♪ Out of your eyes ♪ ♪ What a surprise ♪ - ♪ Yah! ♪ - Is he scatting? No, of course not. ♪ Zippidee- dop ♪ ♪ A- zippidee- doo ♪ ♪ A- zippidee- zop- zop, wabada- boo... ♪ This is bullshit. Shut up. ♪ Ooh- eh ♪ Oh- pah! Zombra, zombra, zombra. Zambra, zombra. Why is he looking at his phone? It probably just can't wait. It's an emergency. Z- Zombra, zambra, zombra, zombra, zombra. Zombarisa... Hai! Hai! Hai! Hai, hai, hai! Ba- boom! - Oh! - Ew! - Get in, you bastard! The end. I have achieved reanimation. Your beloved familiar will return to you tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - Life takes time, my friend. We are reversing the very power of nature itself. But there's a- a quickening ritual, if you want to chivvy things along. As we're all friends, I could do it for a hundy. - No, you bloody won't. We're not interested. - Thank you so very much, Wallace. ♪ Zappidee- doo. ♪ Zappidee- doo. Everything is back to normal, because our Topher is back! It's true. I've got to admit, Wallace, as contemptible a man as he is, - actually came up trumps. - Told you so. You fucking didn't. Don't tell Guillermo, but... I'm so happy Topher is back. All right, let us begin with the minutes. I am here. Guillermo, you are there. And, um... To- pher! Oh, Tophie! And there is Topher. Wonderful. We are all here. We can begin. Firstly- - and I'm not naming names- - but I have recently noticed that the house reeks of decaying flesh, and there are dead birds everywhere. Topher! As I say, I'm not naming names. But if we do have an issue, then it's important that we all work together to let Guillermo know, so that he can fix it. Doze Apples! Off he goes. That chap's tireless, isn't he? You could learn something from Topher, no, Guillermo? I actually have an order of business I'd like to discuss. - Oh... - Okay. - The floor is yours. - I'm a little bit concerned about Topher. I think there might be something really wrong with him. Topher! Aah! - - He waits under my bed and tries to bite me, for one. - Yes. He eats live birds and insects. I think, I think he might be a zombie. That, my boy, sounds like slander. Nandor, what are you going to do about the state of the muck - pouring out of his mouth? - Guillermo, do you have any proof of this wild accusation? Aah! Well, do you? He's not well! - He's freaking out. - Yes! He's gonna eat me! ¡Dios mío! Well, now he's speaking in tongues. That is awful of you to call Topher those things you just did. Exactly. Guillermo, have you been getting enough sleep? No. No, I am not getting anysleep! I haven't slept in the last two weeks, because I have to keep one eye open to protect you guys! Protect us from what? Nothing. I just wish you guys knew how hard I work for you, and you don't, so that's okay, never mind, forget it. Did you see that? - He was eating his own dry poops. - The vampire assassins usually come at night, so I have to constantly survey the perimeter. ♪ ♪ Topher! Topher? No, no, no, no, no, no! I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die, I don't wanna... Sorry. Sorry. Why...? Sorry, buddy, but you were trying to kill me. High five. I don't know, bud. - Come on! - Okay. All right. Aw, shit. - Why?! - Sorry, Toph. See, that's why I didn't want to do that. Toph. No, buddy, I don't think it's gonna go back on there, bud. High five! No, I'm not gonna high- five you anymore. High five! Ow, Toph! That really hurt! - High five! - Stop it, you... You're being really rude right now! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it, Topher. Stop it, Topher! Stop it, Topher! Aw, fuck no! No one bites Guillermo! It was an accident. All right, dudes, I'm headed out. Going up to Albany to catch a community theater production of Pippin. What's going on with, uh, Toph- Dawg? I think he's a zombie. Yeah, could be. See you guys later. You goofballs. No! Why won't you die?! Stop it! Stop it! Ow! Jesus fucking...! Topher! Guillermo! Master... you saved me. Thank you. Your screaming disturbed me from my slumber. You shouldn't be putting your head in there. It's not hygienic. If you want to wash yourself, do it in... Will you stop that! I've had enough of this. He was a good familiar and a fine fellow. But what is done is done. This fuckin' guy. He was a good familiar and a fine fellow. But what is done is done. Are you kidding me with this right now? Just give him a few jolts. I'll be fine. He was a good familiar and a fine fellow. Kind of tickles. You conned us, you slippery bastard! Wallace, how could you do this to us? Yeah, plus, he was crawling on the ceiling, which is odd. - Well, he didn't do that before? - Of course not! Well, okay, I must have used the wrong incantation spell. But you know what? No extra charge. - Bullshit! You made it up as you were going along. - No, no, no, no, that was word- for- word verbatim. No. You were bloody texting on your phone the whole time! It was an Amber Alert. Well, I did think it was important. He is damaged goods, and we demand satisfaction! Not cool, Wallace, not cool. - Fine. Let me have him. - What, do you think I'm gonna let him go? You must be out of your mind. Come here, boy. Come on, come on. That'll do, pig, that'll do. - Wow. - All right, I don't normally do refunds, but I'll take him off your hands for you. And for your trouble, each of you can grab a license plate key chain. For free? Free. Gratis. Okay. Come on! - Oh. "Ingrid." Oh. - I got... "Steve." So if you're watching, Steve... waiting for you. Ah. I got "Nadia," uh, which is my name, but with a less exciting "J." Completely free. You don't have "Colin." We haven't sold any since 1979, mate. But you have "Condom." Very, very popular. - Can I take one? - Go for it. So I got... "Gigi." I guess that's better than "Gizmo." Being a familiar isn't for everyone. You're not always thanked or praised. But after my master saved my life, he proved to me that... he really does care about me and all the things I do for him. And if one day he doesn't, well... Here you go. Down there. That be slippy there, hang on. Here you go. Topher! Yep. Just uh, copy what they do, you'll be fine. Doze Apples! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very good. Be back to check on you next year. Doze Apples. Yes, yes. Gigi. Condom. Topher! ♪ See the people all dressed in white ♪ ♪ Oh, it must be the children of Israel ♪ ♪ Just a- walkin' into the light ♪ ♪ 'Cause there ain't no grave ♪ ♪ Gonna hold my body down ♪ ♪ Oh, there ain't no grave ♪ ♪ Gonna hold my body down ♪ ♪ When that trumpet shot shall blast ♪ ♪ And the dead shall leave at last ♪ ♪ There ain't no grave ♪ ♪ Gonna hold ♪ ♪ My body down. ♪
