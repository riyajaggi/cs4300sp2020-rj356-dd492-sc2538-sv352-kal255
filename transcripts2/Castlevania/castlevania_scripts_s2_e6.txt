 [thudding] [snarling] - [metal clanking] - [rumbling] Can we get that magic mirrorworking? [Sypha] I think so. But I can't do two things at once here. [Alucard] I know some Chaldaic. I know how to operate a distance mirror. Which shall I do? [rumbling] Mm, uh... I can't do either of those things.

 [Alucard] Come on, Belmont. Time to choose. You're either the last son of a warrior dynasty or a lucky drunk. Which is it? [rumbling continues] Hmm. Okay. Get the mirrorworking, Alucard. Give me force numbers, species, and weapons count. Sypha stays on herjob for now. I'll fortify the point of entry. [growling] I thinkwe're going to see the size and disposition of the attacking force fairly quickly with our own eyes, Belmont. I'm forced to agree. Do you have a further suggestion? Are you asking my advice? We're working together, Alucard. You're still a bastard,

 but you're the bastard I chose to fight alongside back in Gresit. Do you have a problem with any of that? None at all. So what do you suggest? Using this to find Dracula's castle. Now. [rumbling] [Alucard] We're trapped in a box down here. We will eventually be overwhelmed, unless we change the nature of the battle. Agreed. Sypha! I'm close to getting it. [Trevor] I'll protect you for as long as I can. I know. [pants] - [clanging] - [grunts] - [rumbles] - [groans] [growling] [thudding] [gasps, groans] [gasps] Ooh. [grunting] [panting] Huh? [soft thud] [sighing] [snarling] [Trevor panting] There you are. Braila. Just to keep the peace between squabbling creatures who will starve and die before the end of the year, anyway. Ah, well. So long as it brings silence. To Braila, then. [gasps] [exhales] [rumbling] [screaming] [Trevor grunting] Oh, for God's sake. [grunts] [grunting continues] [pants] [growling] [grunts] [squelches] [shrieks] [Trevor grunting] [groaning] [grunts] [bats screeching] Bless the river, bishop. Make the water holy. [in Latin]ln nomine patris, et filii, et spiritu sanctu. Hmm... [chanting continues] [rumbling] [screaming] [shrieking] [grunting] [shrieks] [growling] Firedrake. Just what I need in an underground hold full of paper. [explosion] [groans] Probablyjust as well I didn't get to play with the whip when I was a kid. [snarls] When you get back to whatever steaming underworld shithole you came from, you tell them there are still Belmonts up here. [grunting] Whoa. [groaning] [groans] [spits] [grunts] - [grunts] - [snarls] [growling] You're an evil looking bastard, aren't you? Well, I'm armed with a... a stick, hmm? So I'll understand if you want to run away now. [snarling] - [grunts] - [all shouting] - Move. - What? - You're coming with me. - Why? You made your choice, Hector. You can't go back to the castle now. You betrayed the old man. L... l-[sighs] My God. You're still the baby who had his woodland animal corpses taken away. Isaac is still the indigent boy getting beaten in the streets. And Dracula is destroying the world in a tantrum because someone killed his pet breeder. You are all nothing but man-children. Get across the bridge. You're mine now, forgemaster. You have nothing left but me. [soldiers yelling] That's it. - [pants, gasps] - [growls] [grunts] Yah! [snarling] Do you see the castle? Take a look. Good. Keep focused on it. I have to be able to see it to put my intent on it. - Your intent? - That's all magic is, Alucard. Changing things in accordance with my intent. And my intent is to drag that grotesque thing here. [crackling] [grunting] [thudding] [thudding continues] [screaming] [all shouting] [all grunting] [soldier shrieks] - Dracula? - Did we meet resistance at Braila? We are betrayed at Braila. I do not recognize their colors, but the castle is invaded by vampire soldiers. What colors do theywear? Black, with white trim. That is the livery of Styria. Carmilla has made her move. - [rumbling] - What was that? I'm... not sure. Do we have anyone left loyal to us? There is a pitched battle in the main hall. I gathered about a dozen more on myway up there. - They're outside. - Then we go downstairs, lsaac. Nobody takes my castle from me. [grunting] It's fighting me. It's like I'm pulling against an anchor and a waterwheel all at once. He moves the castle using an engine. That's what's acting against you. [rumbling] [snarling] Shit. [soldiers clamoring] Wait. [crackling] Magic. Do as you're told. [all screaming] [rumbling continues] [water rushing] [wind howling] [screaming] What the fuckjust happened? [electricity crackling] [whirring] [rumbling] Ha! I did it! Where did you land the castle, Sypha? Right on top of us! Oh. Mmm, yes. I landed it on the surface, right above this underground space that's probably only held up by wood and dirt. Let's go. [voice] Frederator! BDRipped by jirro
