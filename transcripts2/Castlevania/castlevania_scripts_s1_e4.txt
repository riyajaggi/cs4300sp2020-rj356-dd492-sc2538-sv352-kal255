 Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com - Witches! - Witchcraft! Who's that? Are the Speakers dead? No. Well, get back out there. The Speakers have to die before the sun goes down. The sun... is already down. You cannot enter the house of God. God is not here.

 This is an empty box. God is in all His churches. Your God's love is not unconditional. He does not love us. And He does not love you. I have done His bidding. My life's work is in His name. Your life's work makes Him puke. I am the Bishop of Gresit! Your God knows that we wouldn't be here without you. This is all your fault, isn't it? She was a witch! Lies? In your house of God? No wonder He has abandoned you.

 But we love you. What?! We love you. We couldn't be here without you. Let me... kiss you. He went that way! Get him! We'll get him right now! A sorcerer! Witch! No! I am a Speaker and a scholar of magic. I serve no demon and I do no evil. You never told me you were a magician. You never asked. Though I guess I now understand why it was you who went down into the catacombs to look for your sleeping god. What are you doing here? I didn't ask you to fight for me. I fight for myself. Fine. You. Kill them! Quickly! No. Just you and me. Come on. You're very big at telling other people what to do. Getting the good people of Gresit to commit murder for you. Let's see how you do on your own. You and me. I can see you're carrying a blade. I wonder if the people of the great city of Gresit have ever seen a priest draw a knife before. - Oh, what insolence! - The priest has a knife. Your long knife, my short sword. Let's go. Come on. You had no problem beating an old man this morning. Huh? You had no problem lying to these people about the Speakers. The Speakers brought this upon us! No, they didn't, and you know it. The Speakers stayed here to offer aid. It was your bishop who brought all this down on us. Your bishop who started it all by killing a defenseless woman. You would have made murderers out of these people, but the only one here who isn't innocent... is you. It's them. They're coming. Back to the far side of the square! Pikes! Up front, now! What? Why? Because I'm the only man here who knows how to fight these things. Everyone with a pike or long weapon, get out in front with me. Six in front, six behind, and in between, pikes forward. Hold steady. I need a priest, one who was properly ordained in a church. Grab some people. Go to the nearest well, start drawing water. You know what to do with water, yes? For the aspersion? Go. - Sypha? - Yes. I want them walled in when they hit the square. I want it so they can only come towards us. Is that something you can do? Will ice do? Better than fire, anyway. Let's hope so. I want salt over here! As much as you can find! Everyone with a sword wipes their blades in the salt. Now! Sypha, walls. Well. That priest really could make holy water after all. Pikemen! Four steps forward! Sypha, close the door behind them. Rear pikes up! Cut him down! Salt kills demons! Don't forget... spread the word. Shit. The whip's consecrated... for fighting vampires and demons. Swords! There's an army of us! An army... from hell! The... catacombs again. I think we're deeper than I went before. Aah! Ohh. Oh, for God's sake. Ohh! I didn't do that. Why are you here? The story... the Messiah sleeps under Gresit! The man who will save us from Dracula. And you? Are you in search of a mythical savior? I fell down a hole. Dracula is abroad in the land. He has an army of monsters. He's determined to wipe out all human life wherever he finds it. Is that what you believe? That Dracula's released his horde in Wallachia? That's fact. There's no "belief" involved. But that's not what you're asking. No. You're asking if I believe you're some sleeping messiah who'll save us, and no, I don't. Belmont! I know what you are. And what am I? You're a vampire. So, I have to ask myself, have we come down here to wake up the man who'll kill Dracula, or did we come here to wake Dracula? You call me Dracula. I'll call you anything you like if you're gonna show me your teeth. She called you Belmont. House of Belmont? Trevor Belmont. Last son of the house of Belmont. The Belmonts fought creatures of the night, did they not? For generations. Say what you mean. The Belmonts killed vampires. Until the good people decided they didn't want us around. And now Dracula is carrying out an execution order on the human race. Do you care, Belmont? Honestly, I didn't, no. But now... yes, it's time to stop it. Do you think you can? What I think... is I'm going to have to kill you. Belmont, no! He's the one we've been waiting for. No, he's not. He's a vampire. And he's not been waiting here for hundreds of years, have you? I don't like your tone, Belmont. This place is old, but it's not been abandoned. It's alive and working. So, go on, vampire, tell her exactly how long you've been waiting down here. What is the year of your Lord? 1476. Perhaps a year, then. There. And on top of that, what kind of messiah creates mechanical death traps to buy himself an uninterrupted nap in a stone coffin? My defenses were not for you. You could have told your defenses that. They are machines, nothing more. They were not intended to protect me from you. I asked you a question... do you care? I care about doing my family's work. I care about saving human lives. Am I going to have to kill you? Do you think you can? If you're really a Belmont and not some runt running around with a family crest, you might be able to. Let's find out. Belmont, you can't do this! Tell it to your floating vampire Jesus here. You've got nothing but insults, have you? A tired little... Stone the fuck up. You can't do this, Belmont! He's not your messiah. Dracula's castle can appear anywhere, Sypha. And I told you, this is what he looks like on the inside. And you know what Dracula looks like? Nobody knows what Dracula looks like. You've got fangs, and you sleep in a coffin. Aah! Please. This isn't a bar fight. Have some class. Aah! Do you have a god to put a last prayer to, Belmont? Yeah. Dear God, please don't let the vampire's guts ruin my good tunic. What? I can still rip your throat out. You can, but it won't stop me staking you. But you will still die. But I don't care. Killing you was the point. Living through it was just a luxury. I will incinerate you before your fangs touch that man's throat. I thought I was your legendary savior. So did I. But he saved my life. You're a Speaker-Magician. Yes, and his goal is mine... to stand up for the people. Good. Very good. A vampire hunter and a magician. You'll do. I am Adrian Tepes. Known to the Wallachians as Alucard... son of Vlad Dracula Tepes. I've been asleep here in my private keep under Gresit for a year, to heal the wounds dealt by my father when I attempted to stop him unleashing his demon armies. You are the sleeping soldier. I'm aware of the stories. I'm also aware that the Speakers consider the story to be information from the future. Do you know the whole story? Yes. The sleeping soldier will be met by a hunter and a scholar. No one told me that. Why do you think my grandfather tried everything to make you stay? I hate Speakers. So, what happens now? I need a hunter and a scholar. I need help to save Wallachia... ...perhaps the world... and defeat my father. Why? Because it is what my mother would have wanted. And we are all, in the end... slaves to our families' wishes. You'll help us kill Dracula and save Wallachia? My father has to die. We three... we can destroy him. Frederator!
